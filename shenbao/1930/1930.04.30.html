<p>時評</p>
<h3>美報界抨擊海會</h3>
<p>此次之倫敦合議。爲世界注目之英美合作所發起。英美合作之目的。本以應付日本。乃會議之結果。忽於歐洲方面之交涉。英美間發現重大之裂痕。是亦可見國際間之外交政治家。無論運用何種手段。决不能盡如我意想者也。昨報載美新聞業巨擘赫斯特氏。在各報發表致英相一文。痛擊英相對海會之兩面應付。謂爲縊殺英美合作之原因。并恐牽入二次大戰旋渦。雖其所言。未必果有如是之重大影響。然英美問意見之參商。則己顯然呈露者也。美新聞界所攻擊英相之兩面應付。固未指明何事。惟在議會中。英相曾電勸美國民。勿速失望。謂英美不同之點。一則始終不欲參加歐洲外交。一則决計欲與歐陸　國從事合作。惟信兩國政府必能運用其思想與勢力。以維持世界和平。其後美化表團亦正式發一聲明。力言不願參加歐洲盟約。以闢外間謠傳。美國　極不願與聞之歐局。而英必欲强使一併解决。此殆美新聞界所以憤憤不平而責備英相之所由來也。</p>
<p>夫英美之所以主張不同。亦各爲其自身利害計。英與歐陸利害關係較切不能不兼圖與歐陸合作。然欲兼與歐陸合作。即不能不發生兩面應付之困難此固可以意想測之者。蓋兩面應付之中。勢必與兩面之利害不能無所衝突一有衝突。爭執即起。非特國際間然也即在一國之内。執政者之應付政局與政黨議會。亦皆有兩面爲難之苦。如日議會此次抨擊政府應付軍縮。之失當。在當局亦有兩面爲難之苦。人民方。面則願减軍以輕負担。海軍方面則欲維持國防。不滿於妥協辦法。當局在此兩方責難之中。不能不捨棄一方以遷就一方。否則欲兩方遷就。必至兩主皆不滿意。然則世之外交家與政治家。欲用一種巧妙手段以敷衍各方面者。豈易事哉。</p>

<p>此次總錦標、共二座、一爲田徑賽、一爲網球小錦標二座、一爲田徑賽之個人第一、一爲接力賽　以實力論、滬江東吳、在歷史上有奪標之可能、惟徑賽方面、晏成程金冠、預料有得百米二百米及低欄三個個人第一之可能　故個人錦標較有把握、惟團體錦標則似須努力逐鹿也</p>
<p>網球方面、滬江余田光輩輩聲海上、明强東吳於初賽、雖似得利、、惟錦標恐非滬江莫屬</p>

<h3>日本對於足球錦標之妄測</h3>
<p>保持第八屆之亞軍榮譽</p>
<p>輕視中華隧國人當努力</p>
<p>東京通訉、日本的足球、從未在遠東大會上露過頭角、第八次在上海突破菲軍而居第二位、原是破天荒的僥倖結果謂日人却因此自豪　對於此次的錦標、更作妄想、且不顧實情的作輕視我國的論調、下面是日本足球隊主將的言論、很可作一般的代表、雖屬妄言、却很足促吾人的注意、歷屆連戰連敗之日本足球因在第八次大會之勝利而發生新生氣、二年來之研究精進與蹴球協會之提倡、而有現在精强的候補總手十九名、他們都是第一流者、在任何說法决不弱於中菲的選手、連年優勝之中國隊雖依然希然其錦標的保持、菲軍亦期望雲洗舊恥、但後進的、精銳的日本隊將來一躍而得驚人之勝利、確是意中的事、</p>
<p>中華隊從來是賴個人的强點而獲勝、其個人之活躍、如盤球之純熟帶球之迅快、脚頭之穏健、踢法之巧妙、避敵之靈活、確是日菲不及的、說是屬於傳統的、先天的也不爲過、然而這些單純優點、决不是現今獲勝足球的唯一條件、所以老氣横秋的華隊、這次也許不能趾高氣揚的如往昔了、菲軍釣優點在聯絡合宜、全隊一氣、他們那種奮門的　　、尤是難得這都足球獲勝的要素、也是華不及菲的地方、因此、此次任何輕視菲軍的諷評是不對的事、中菲雖同爲難備之隊、然吾人寗信菲軍之難攻、而否認中國隊之不易破、</p>
<p>日本則羅致全國的一流選手、有二個月的合宿練習、定能成爲最强之一隊、再加上中菲没有地利、來與中菲對抗、較處優勝的地位、但是在國際對抗的大會上、隊員的精神和態度的緊要、决不次於球技、臨陳自若經騐豐富的選手就是祇具平庸的技倆、也能十二分的發展出來、這是日本隊員訓練時應特别注意的、</p>
<p>說到打倒華隊、也有妙法、是要一鼓作氣的從開賽起就壓迫并制服他們不讓他們少佔優勝、因爲中華隊每每乘一遭的上風、就要發揮實力以上的活躍而一帆風順了、反之、就一蹶不振、勢如破竹的敗北、這自然烏合之衆、必有的現象、</p>
<p>記者按日本的足球雖近年很有進步、但實力仍不足爲我國之敵、以上自然是鼓勵他們選手的說法、不過他人的批評至少總能助我們的攺善和自勵、望我國選手注意焉、</p>

<h3>英商擴張對華航業</h3>
<p>藍星公司派三十輪行中國</p>
<p>中歐航路、今年各公司競爭頗烈、日郵社特建一萬一千噸之油機快輪兩艘、一曰照國丸、一名静國丸、在下月分己可開行、而藍烟囱公司、亦建摩托巨輪主艘、不久將落成來華、而英商藍星公司、亦於此競爭潮流中、將來華開闞中歐新航線、以爭中國出口營業、茲將所聞情形、分記如下、</p>
<p>派卅輪行遠東　藍星輪公司、在十七年以前、曾經派船來華、開任歐洲班、後即停航、唯每年間派一二輪至南京、代和記洋行裝貨、該公司營業、側重在南菲洲一路、今因中國鮮蛋、運歐日多、而藍星船之冷汽艙著名歐洲、比較他公司船爲巨、故特來中國、開闢新路、専航歐洲線、己在本埠南京路設立分行、聘定唐華滔爲總理、共派三十艘巨輪來華、總噸量共有二十五萬噸云、</p>
<p>航路營業狀况　第一批己先派定六船來滬、而首次至上海者、曰德古馬星號、今日可以進口、五月三日開頭班赴英、第二船日阿爾朋星號、約下月内至申、其餘如杜力星·勞合星·太里乾星·福里沙星等輪、均爲八千净噸之大、船以後每月行一輸、航路己規定自上海·經香港·星加坡·濱榔嶼·波塞·至倫敦·兼赴荷德兩國、而以利物溥爲最終點、</p>
<p>明年添行客船　現在創開之際、營業上除利用冷汽間、裝運中國出口之大批鮮蛋以外、兼裝各項雜貨至歐、並定至明年春、則在中英線内添開搭客郵船、至於南京和記洋行之出口貨、則仍歸該公司輪承運也、自該公司派三十輪行駛中國之消息傳布後、歐洲一路内之英日各航商、將激起極端之競爭潮矣、</p>

<p>英輪集宜候開、英商上游江輪、因領江罷工、而停業至滬者、現皆紛紛由滬上駛、昨得宜昌來電、謂各英商、對於領江之要求增薪條件、尚未完全容納、故領江亦未曾上輪復職、而太古怡和之渝宜各班輪、悉在宜昌抛泊、一俟增薪條件僉字、即行開赴重慶、</p>
<p>峨嵋復行川河　招商局之上江船峨嵋號、今交來滬大修、業己竣工、昨經議定復行川河航路、上海方面積阻之運川貨甚多、故昨日峨嵋輪、共裝棉紗一千五百八十八包、而水脚收入、有二萬餘兩之巨、實爲華商江輪中之最難得者、准今日上駛、該局昨己電請總部通令經過各地軍警、予以保護矣、</p>

<p>上海貨辦理灘水　該輪到滬後、即在浦東白蓮涇碼頭停泊、其失火之一二艙貨物中、亦有上海貨在内、焚毁者均係浮艙面貨一部份、其在下艙者、尚無大損、惟以灌水救火、致各貨多受水漬、昨日該行己將來貨卸出、一面通告各客家、先辦攤水、按照貨件估價、收取百分之十五分、作爲攤水費、受漬貨件等、候請公正人到白蓮涇碼頭、檢定以後、再行核算損失、船身並未受損、故今日仍得照常開班也</p>

<h3>檠邊墨話陳天怡</h3>
<p>象皮套鞋　東友某君。歸自蕪湖。余叩以沿途所察狀况。東友曰。貴國人士。近來銳意圖强。良堪欽佩。惟余今次赴蕪。泝江而上。雖風景依然。而民家屋上所蓋稻草。己多作灰黑色。不若以前之逐年遞换。色皆清白。於此可見民力之衰敝。大非昔比。一農家門首。竟高懸有橡皮套鞋兩雙。該地距離蕪湖不遠。赤足儘可往還。農家獨不惜兩元有餘之代價。購用此品。則民俗之媮。己可槪見。今欲以此圖强。空言攺革。不亦緣木而求魚耶。余韙其說。嘿然良久。因誌之以告國人。</p>
<p>外國人　外國人。非眞外國人也。乃我鄕海曲之一守財奴耳。奴性儉嗇。擁資數十萬。衣短褐。赤雙足。常往來田廛間。有所餘。輒埋地中。鄰有貸者。必先預約發其窖銀。償亦必以銀幣。奴不識字。亦不令其子孫讀書。并不自知其究有若干財産。遇盜刧。刑逼之堅不吐實。遂死於盜。子名小外國人。亦酷有父風。居恒於屋後置長梯一。以備盜刦時登逃之用。至奴之所以名外國人者。因曾與一鄕女私通。被人剪去其辮。時在清季。故多以外國人呼之。而眞姓名反湮没不彰矣。</p>
<h3>誌滇南之蔓陀羅清</h3>
<p>蔓陀羅。即茶花。其葉常靑。經冬不凋。然與茶相似。且栽植宜於山麓。故俗名山茶。花之色極繁。不限於紅。而吐蕊時。不僅春之一季爲盛。冬末亦有之。吾蘇拙政園。向以此花聞於時。近乃凋謝。不復邀人一盼己。亦可見名花與時代謝。而榮悴之所關。非無由焉。日前余戚戴君自雲南回。述及滇中此花之盛。有足錄者。因濡筆補之。</p>
<p>昆明市。本爲沃衍之奥區。嘉卉葱蘢。西南一美麗之肥土也。近以藝事日進。園林所闢。花木增輝。而尤以茶花爲特産。樹之大者。高可數丈。徑二三尺。花朶有多至數千者。每當冬盡春來。觀之色紅如火。不啻五月榴花。照眼鮮明。其形則逾於牡丹。而艶麗且過之。其本相傳有七十二種。今增至百數十未止。亦可見栽植之精進矣。其在省城附近所植者。其花尤佳。有寳珠瑪瑙胭脂片等名。仙葩旖旋。美質斑爛。故有名昆明市爲花之都者。每於春日聚羣花展覽。市民出品。今歲達三萬數千盆。可稱鉅觀。前市長馬軫曾挑選（大紫袍）。（柳葉銀紅）。及（九心十八瓣）三種。運送分植中山陵墓。今不知能着花未。</p>
<p>又西山泰華寺。有一木。其樹最老。每歲開花。相傳明建文帝所手植。與城以外東北龍泉觀之唐梅宋柏相輝映云。</p>
<h3>福建之鳥餘茶盛</h3>
<p>福建之武夷山。風景極幽緻。山間出産茶葉。亦極著名。故武夷茶與黄山茶。俱爲嗜茶者所稱道。</p>
<p>武夷茶之種類甚夥。若雀舌。若珠蘭。若烏龍而其中最爲嗜茶者所稱道者。厥爲鳥餘茶。　閩南如漳厦一帶。啜茗之風特盛。一茶而三金五金。乃習見之事。據嗜茶者。云鳥餘茶之香味。殊非别種所克比倫。並謂鳥餘茶之出産地。以武夷第一峯爲最著。非此。則必爲贋貨。鳥餘茶之意義。果故爲而得之乎。則以武夷之第一峯。高齊雲霄。而懸崖之間。生長茶樹。人雖欲往採摘。又非人力所能爲。另有一種鳥。類喜啄食懸崖間之茶葉。鳥食之餘。土人拾而製之。因名。其價值頗昻。駕黄山雲霧茶而上之。</p>
<h3>杭縣孝女鄕之鐵田斅厂</h3>
<p>杭邑孝女鄕尹家山之麓。有田一畦。共計十八畝。田之四周。胥界以山。而田中開掘稍深。即現鐵隔。全田皆然。故以鐵田稱。抒事者或謂其下係古時王　。或謂其下藏有寳物。猜測紛紜。究不知下爲何物。顧鐵田之名。由來己久。且傳播遐邇。迺者。事聞於杭垣博物學家江子善君。君爲好奇心所驅使。特往該處慫恿田主顧某開掘。以覘究竟。而顧早具此心。祇以助興無人。故未實行。此次經江慫恿。即欣然從之。當僱工人多名。偕江至田中開掘。掘時。先將上層浮泥掘去。詎掘至二尺餘深處。即過硬物隔住。不能再掘。視之果鐵隔也。於是用種種方法。經六人一晝夜之功。始將該鐵隔鑿破而掘去方丈之地。鐵厚可三分。鐵之下則爲細粘之香灰泥。泥厚尺許。下舗石蛋。去石蛋。則爲平舗之盌足底。詎盌底下。則又爲鐵隔。似較上層爲厚。故竟無法去之。於是江顧二人氣爲之餒。且風聲所播。四方來觀者踵相接。二人恐當地警局聞訊前往干涉。故即將泥土耙平。停止工作。然己轟傳邇遐矣。</p>
<p>上述之鐵田。自此次開掘後。雖不得其究竟。然睹此秘詭之形跡。。實令人稱奇不置。茲特紀之如右。以供海内考古家之研究</p>
<h3>醫師醫婆命名本意考昨晚成</h3>
<p>中國的西醫。自稱曰（醫師）。按周禮醫師官名。與醫官同義。天官之屬。爲衆醫之長。掌醫之政令五代有翰林醫官使。宋制。翰林醫官院使副各二人。又明仿儒學之制置醫官。謂之醫學府。正科一人。州典科一人。縣訓科一人。皆不給祿。清代尚沿其例。</p>
<p>我人考（醫師）兩字之本義。則今之衛生局人員。曁行政機關中之掌醫政者可稱醫師。急就篇云醫生古稱醫匠醫匠云者。能補救人命猶物之損壞使工匠修理也。含義亦大矣哉今之西醫皆自稱曰醫師。揆之古義。未免欠合。</p>
<p>長安客話云。明制。民間婦有精通方脈者。由各衙門選取。以至司禮監。御醫會選。中者著名。藉以待詔。名曰醫婆。觀此。古時婦人習醫。統稱曰醫婆。今人有謂産科女醫生曰醫婆者。則含義又覺太狹矣。</p>
<h3>南洋之代理結婚秋水</h3>

<p>。婚禮旣畢。送入洞房。不知者竟信爲一對眞夫婦矣。夫婚禮而可以倩人代理。則一客不煩二主。床第之事。此女友亦當一承其乏也。不亦趣哉。</p>
<h3>南洋游記（二十一）靈花</h3>
<p>第二期羅馬滅猶太。大將Ｔitus攻下耶路撒冷。死人十萬。掠人九萬七千撒鹽於猶太城使草木不生。那曉得不知不覺紀元後。猶太生了個耶蘇。出了個上帝羅馬人把東方猶太的上帝。搬到全歐洲去了。到西三百十三年君士但丁大帝把他定成國敎。於是東方猶太製造的這個上帝神帽眞利害。歐人一直帶到現在。一千九百三十年傳至全球。雖然新科學家要打倒然而大多數人還在恭恭敬敬帶着呢。所以史家邁氏說。Ｍyers羅馬人征服猶太的肉體猶太征伏羅馬的靈魂。究竟還不知誰上算呢。這是東西文化接觸的第二期。</p>
<p>西六本二年即唐太宗即位之年。又呌做海格拉之年ＴheHegirao這海格拉是何怪物就是亞洲阿拉伯地方。又有個新上帝出現。這新上帝差來的使命。就是一個駱駝隊商名呌Ｍhammed摩哈穆德。他同他的四十歲寡婦主人Ｋanija結了婚。夫婦造成一個新敎。就是現在的天方敎徒。耶曆六二二年做紀元。他的上帝。也是大愛。不過到了耶曆七百五十年的時候。回敎兵力就西打西班牙北境大西洋邊。東到中國西境。就是郭子儀所謂的回紇。杜甫詩所吟咏的。這個上帝可是利害。此後和耶敎上帝戰爭約有二百年。所謂十字軍東征前後七八次從一○九五年第一次ＩrtCtrusade十字軍東征直至一二四四年第七次止。結果是回敎國將耶路撒冷聖地奪去。你曉得回敎如此利害。原來回敎中文化含有印度中國文化在内的。（據Ｈ·Ｇ·ＷellsOutlinesofHisory）原來歐人中世迷信神權。有病不許食藥。。只好聽神父禱告。壽告不好。那是上帝呌他該死的。只好埋了。東征結果。回人的藥方算學才傳過歐洲。代數Ａlgebra原是回人創的。化學也是。還有希拉哲學。歐人早己絶了。經回敎諸大學。轉譯成拉丁文去。你看歐洲彼時文化多可憐呢。這是唐宋時代的舊賬。東西文化第三次接觸。海上文明的近世代表。算是英人。考英人文化發原。當六世紀之末。有一個羅馬主敎呌大古雷來。ＰopeGreorytheGreat他一天在羅馬市上閒遊。看見奴塲裏新來些小孩子出賣。孩子長的很體面。他問你們從何處來的。答從英吉利來Ａngles主敎耳聞心動以爲是從天使那面來的。因爲天使與英吉利字音甚相近。於是决意向英倫傳耶敎。到了七世紀英人差不多受了耶敎。才有文化起來。這是當唐明皇李太白楊貴妃時代的事</p>

<p>新絲歐銷不動···陳絲價益下落</p>
<p>邇來天時不正内地各屬蠶汎不佳、洋莊絲市益呈疲滯、日絲市價又告慘落、期絲尤甚、滬埠各廠商因江浙新繭轉瞬上市、新繭期絲求售心切、而歐莊以日絲奇廉擯持不動、即陳繭現絲則抑價不懈、廠商忍痛讓價抛售、營業日呈危殆、昨由華通進滬廠經二十包、乾利進魯廠經三十包、價益趨疲、華絲商對於絲市前途、均抱悲觀云、</p>
<h3>海寗繭汛大致不佳</h3>
<p>現已大眠··最遲一星期可上簇</p>
<p>海寗各市鄕、近年來蠶事日趨進展、繭産日增、繭質亦佳、今歲農民因官廳分發攺良種、故均加增飼額、蠶汛在二眠左右、尚無變動、迨至三眠、天時忽變、始則風雹交加、桑芽受損、繼則盛熱奇寒、甚至春雨連綿、致蠶蜷備受影響、因食混葉而洩黄者有之、寒暖無度而殭斃不起者有之、現已大、眠早帮己開葉、邇來天時仍不晴暢、四鄕蠶汛大致不佳、最遲一星期、蠶蟻大帮可上簇、繭行出月七八等日可開秤云、</p>
<h3>婺祁新茶提早開採</h3>
<p>婺邑洲園新茶、因近日天氣暴、熱一日下雨數次、茶葉增長甚速、榖雨春茶、正可開採、一般茶户、鑒於歲米價飛翔、人工缺貴、除舊歲雇定有茶工者、可緩開園外、多茶缺工之户、一律提早開採、昨今兩日（二十）北鄕一帶茶户、已有少數搶先摘製、免臨時趕摘不及、各源山茶茶户、均紛紛向茶號糧舖告貸茶米、預備登塲、</p>
<p>祁浮紅茶發育時期、曩均較綠茶爲早、年來因氣候關係、開園採焙、嘗與綠茶同時開塲、近日祁浮兩路頭茶、各山户大半開始採哂、茶號亦相繼開塲、紛紛派員出秤、設立支莊搜買、如連日天氣晴明、不再下雨、則頭茶利於哂坯、質味可望優美、惟各號受景鎭禁米出口影響、所購食米、多未啟運、又以新茶正採、急須開秤、故先行進山開塲後、再設法籌辦糧米、以濟工、人此舉成爲茶號目前之重大問題云、</p>
<h3>糧食河下米市續軟</h3>
<p>閘北　昨日到船寥寥市銷因屆月底、買氣愈寂、白粳河中所存高貨漸少、行情仍平、中次各粳底貨仍厚、銷路呆滯又軟五分至一角、薄稻項貨已在十九元關内、銷化竟懈、羊杜秈可稱絶跡、雖有一兩號貨船、雙方價難接近、故市形穏周、白元又覺沉寂、客銷因銀根關係、交易甚微、市疲近角、高變元開十八元關左、</p>
<p>滙　　河下抵埠貨船計六七號、　　進　呆木、大盤萎疲、常帮機粳仍須二十元、斯項貨價行將久持、蘇同白粳走銷清淡、緣鄕莊零户悉購洋米、因此中關以下之粳米萬難發展、完全受洋米之軋脚、故續跌半角許、南帮練塘泗涇等薄早稻均不爽化、是以近日到源亦告寥落、行情呆定、羊杜尖此間亦極枯薄、去路見抵即罄、市頗堅穏、變元陰化到銷兩淡、暫乏榮辱、</p>
<h3>近期粉逐見暴落</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、近期銳落、遠期平定、本月份於午前尚維持五錢關口、下午則人心更虚、逐見暴落、最低曾跌到二兩四錢八分二釐半、查此種突如其來之跌勢、似覺出人意外、但就最近之實銷如是奇寂、阜豐空頭、有非小不補之意、市勢久有墜落可能、因實銷不辦棧單即少銷路多頭之不能爭抗、要亦屬於環境之不容也、五月份市面亦被滯、帶小不少、六月份至九月份、多頭擯持出力、上落無幾、觀出月份開價、五月份雖屬靑黄、惟銷如不暢、廠存則尚豐厚、以本月份過去之情形相衡、恐終呈呆滯之局也、結果本月份較前日小一分半、五月份小一、分六月份小二釐半、七九月份本動、八月份反好二釐半云、</p>
<h3>麥市呈互擯之局</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、初以洋麥好起四五角、人心略穏、下午以天時又見晴雨、市氣略覺疲滯、惟上落不巨、勢车互擯、因大部分多頭、無錫帮佔去不少、在未到新貨時期、錫帮終思得最後之勝利、故景象雖佳、市面終少出人也、本月份交割、實際聞祇八車、由泰康收、去其餘俱雙方了結、本月份結局之不佳、迨即此故也、結果六月份較小一分、七月份不動、八月份小一分、九月份大一分、現麥市面、喊價與前相、仿惟廠家必須五兩進關、方有進意、結果由行家貼用、成交九千餘包、故事實上似又小幾分也、蚌埠徐州南宿州清江浦麥均開五兩云、</p>
<h3>洋米稍呆立跌角外</h3>
<p>昨日洋米因客帮停頓、立見疲滯無神、且有新到兩船、市價乃小角外、交易亦清淡、統市祇開二號西貢一千包、敏黨五百包、小絞一千包、大絞五百包、紅小絞五百、包糙茄拉地四百包、安南粳一千包、期貨進胃甚呆、竟無交易云、</p>
<h3>五金白鐵瓦銷路激增</h3>
<p>白鐵瓦新近交易、大有雨後春笋之勢、其成交者多爲本街之建築帮、即出口方面之靑島大連、點綴亦繁、故二三日來、統計開出數工達一千六百餘札之多、價格一層亦因到源有限、兼之先令萎疲、故亦好起數錢如二十八號每担估十二兩二錢半、二十六號、十一兩五錢、二十四號十兩○五錢、查開出尤以二十八號最爲暢旺云、</p>
<h3>組鉛絲大批定出</h3>
<p>十號十二號十四號等粗鉛絲、爲戰爭中之暢銷品、故連日售出爲數甚、夥因此市面屢有不繼之虞、昨日海外定貨交易因之大旺、綜計定出共有一千七百餘札、其價大致在八兩五錢至九兩左右、惟其裝船、大都趕速、預料到貨必、旺市價一層不無影響、</p>
<h3>疋頭寗波帮運去大批東疋</h3>
<p>疋頭交易昨復見静、浙路漸告停、辦惟寗波帮昨運去大批東疋、有三百餘件、就中以元洋紗最夥、故點秋香現貨有一空之勢、價仍售一兩四錢、條子色汀、本廠花布裝去亦頗不少、浙省加稅聲中、一批交易已告一段落、嗣後恐須停頓多時矣、客帮中無論川漢贛等埠、均甚清淡、毫無躉批添辦、趨勢之、静實爲歴來所罕、有以致存底充斥之貨、莫不大落、尤以花布爲最、冲深色倘有十件去路祇售三兩九錢較之上月跌去達三錢之譜、八十疋箱跌去有二十四兩、故一般執貨者莫不大受虧耗、藍條色汀印花蔴紗亦略下落、西貨白條蔴紗本街頗有成交、泰隆貨一錢八分半、中和貨一錢九分、藍條府綢走銷己呆、素府綢山東天津等帮、昨運去二十餘件云、</p>
<h3>油市漢桕油産地已停榨</h3>
<p>桕油至夏令本爲燭淘落令之時、而皂廠正在繁用之際、本埠各桕油行存積素薄、月初時曾抛售某著名皂廠四百噸、價爲十八兩一二錢、過磅明皮、絡繹解交、初甚秘密、因係空數、其油須仰漢上廠城油抵解、嗣後外面始漸知悉、漢上行家亦得有風傳、且滬行頻頻向漢辦油、因是漢旣悉滬行係抵解空數、價格故意勒緊、麻城油初僅十三兩六錢、現已加至十三兩八錢、聞即欲加十四兩雖絡繹辦到、數已不少、然做空數者己不能獲利癸、據朱洪重荆已售至十四兩二錢、三恒十四兩、雜牌枝重須十三兩八九錢、平荆十三兩五六、錢津市十三兩一二錢、且聞鄂西荆宜一帶産地均已停榨後到恐不能大旺、因此市面恐不能望廉矣、</p>

<p>（一）汝當使汝之汽車。時時健康强固。一無弊病</p>
<p>（二）駕車外出。嘗時時不失統馭之力。設在一刹那間。見前面有車輛人物。而不能設法塞車。則爲取禍之道也。</p>

<p>墨西哥之道路大增　墨西哥向以牛馬爲運輸利器。自道路路加以後。汽車轉運事業。日益發展。路長街闊。交通便利。現有汽車路。所經均爲重要城市。近築一萬國道路。連遦北美大道。載客運貨。均利用汽車。時間旣短。費用又省。因之今年墨西哥之築路計劃。之爲擴充。據去年之统計。墨西哥共有乘客汽車五萬四千輛。公共汽車四千三百輛。貨車一萬三千八百輛。今年墨政府擬用一千一百五十萬圓爲築路費。以期全國道路四通八達。此後汽車事業之發展。正未可限量也。</p>

<h3>American Media Criticizes the Naval Conference</h3>
<p>The current London Conference, initiated by the English-American cooperation that has captured the world's attention. The purpose of English-American cooperation was originally to deal with Japan. However, the outcome of the conference was a significant rift between England and America in their negotiations concerning Europe. This shows that international diplomats and politicians, no matter what means they employ, cannot fully achieve their intentions. Yesterday's newspapers carried an article by the American newspaper mogul Hearst, published in various newspapers, addressed to the British Prime Minister. It vehemently criticized the British Prime Minister's duplicity in dealing with the Naval Conference, calling it the cause of strangling English-American cooperation and fearing it would drag them into the vortex of a Second World War. Although his words may not have such a significant impact, it is clear that disagreements have emerged between England and America. The American media's criticism of the British Prime Minister's duplicity did not specify what it was about. However, in Parliament, the British Prime Minister telegraphed to urge the American people not to be quickly disappointed, saying that the difference between England and America is that one has never wanted to participate in European diplomacy, and the other is determined to cooperate with European countries. He believes that the governments of the two countries will be able to use their ideas and power to maintain world peace. Later, the American delegation also officially issued a statement, strongly stating that it does not want to participate in European alliances, to dispel rumors. America is extremely unwilling to hear about the European situation, but England must force it to be resolved together. This is probably the reason why the American media is indignant and blames the British Prime Minister.</p>
<p>The reason why England and America have different positions is each for their own interests. England has a closer relationship with Europe and cannot but plan to cooperate with Europe. However, wanting to cooperate with Europe inevitably leads to the difficulty of dealing with both sides. This can be imagined. In dealing with both sides, there is bound to be conflict with the interests of both sides. Once there is a conflict, disputes arise. This is not only true in international relations, but also within a country, the ruling party's handling of the political situation and the party's parliament also has the difficulty of dealing with both sides. For example, the Japanese parliament criticized the government's handling of military reduction. The authorities also have the difficulty of dealing with both sides. The people want to reduce military spending to lighten the burden, while the navy wants to maintain national defense and is dissatisfied with compromise. The authorities, caught between these two parties' accusations, have to abandon one side to accommodate the other. Otherwise, if they want both sides to accommodate, both sides will be dissatisfied. Therefore, it is not easy for diplomats and politicians in the world to use a clever means to perfunctorily deal with all aspects.</p>

<h3>Allocation of Funds to the Beining Railway is Unrelated to Debt</h3>

The responsibility to creditors has been completely fulfilled. The Ministry of Railways has the right to freely allocate the railway's funds. The Ministry's order to allocate 100,000 yuan per month to the Guangdong-Hankou Railway this time has no impact on the railway's debt. The British ambassador should not interfere.

<h3>A Comic Scene in the Japanese Parliament</h3>
<p>Councilors slam the table into great chaos</p>
<p>Prime Minister's mouth movement suspected of eating foreign candy</p>
<p>The Lion smiles</p>
<p>Causing the entire arena to burst into laughter</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - Yesterday afternoon, the House of Representatives held a plenary session. Regarding the bill to increase compulsory education expenses, questions from the opposition party were endless. Taking the opportunity, Minseito party member Okamoto Sanetaro moved to end the questioning. The Seiyukai party rose up in opposition, disregarding the Speaker's announcement. Thereupon, more than a dozen fierce members of the Seiyukai party rushed to the Speaker's seat, slamming the table and accusing him of tyranny. Speaker Fujisawa only smiled and did not argue with them. By this time, dozens of people had gathered at the Speaker's seat. The clerks attempted to bring out the voting slips to call the roll, but the excited councilors ignored them, and the chaos worsened. The Speaker had no choice but to announce a recess. Seiyukai councilors clapped and returned to their seats. After a short break, the session reopened and again descended into chaos, leading to a second recess. When the session reopened for the third time, the Speaker stated that his duties had just been obstructed. Before he could finish speaking, Aoki Seiichi and Hara Sobei, among others, again left their seats, and the situation became even more uncontrollable. The Speaker then announced the adjournment of the session. Members of both the Minseito and Seiyukai parties, having not heard the Speaker's announcement amidst the chaos, remained in their original seats. Only when they realized that the session had been adjourned did they exchange bitter smiles, applaud, and leave the arena. Before the chaos, Prime Minister Hamaguchi was occasionally in private conversation with Foreign Minister Shidehara, his lips moving slightly. Aoki Seiichi saw this, and Prime Minister Hamaguchi's tongue also moved. Such food in the parliament is extremely careless. Hara Sobei said that Hamaguchi was eating foreign candy, and Hamaguchi also likes sweet things. The Prime Minister heard this and broke into a smile. Mr. Hara then said, "Lion" (Prime Minister Hamaguchi's nickname), your things are actually making you laugh. Thereupon, the entire arena burst into laughter. At 11:30 PM, the Minseito party held an executive meeting to discuss accusing nineteen councilors of the Seiyukai party of obstructing official duties through their violent behavior. Some opposed this, and a decision has not yet been reached as of this morning.</p>
<h3>The Minister of the Army's Absence Stirs Up Trouble</h3>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - At 10:00 AM on the 28th, the House of Peers held a plenary session. First, Hanai Takuzo requested the session to proceed, immediately asking from his seat, "Why is Minister of the Army Ugaki absent? If there are questions for the Minister of the Army, who will answer them and in what capacity?" Prime Minister Hamaguchi answered, "The Minister of the Army is absent due to illness. Regarding questions about the army, if they pertain to administrative matters, they will be answered by a government committee member. If they pertain to political matters, I will answer them. If it is determined that the Minister of the Army must answer, then the Minister of the Army is managing state affairs from his sickbed and can answer in writing." Hanai continued, "That someone cannot attend parliament and yet no one is appointed to oversee the Minister of the Army's affairs is unprecedented since the promulgation of the Meiji Constitution in the 23rd year. For the Prime Minister, who has no direct responsibility for military affairs, to give vague and irresponsible answers is unacceptable. From a legal standpoint, it is also inappropriate. I ask the Prime Minister to consider and study this, and to provide a clear answer at the plenary session on the 30th." The government side showed some signs of unease at this point, then entered the agenda and continued with questions for the Minister of State's speech. Yamaoka Mannosuke took the podium, first stating that he intended to question the government regarding the implementation of the budget, the lifting of the gold embargo, countermeasures for the economic downturn, and unemployment relief. He then strongly argued that due to the government's incompetence, the unemployment problem has become a political problem, and the current government has no active countermeasures for this. The Prime Minister answered that there are countermeasures for unemployment and listed various policies. Yamaoka further stated that indirect procedures may be too slow and mentioned the unemployment problem of the educated proletariat, attacking the government.</p>

<h3>Europe's International Relations Amid Naval Treaty Signing</h3>
<p>British Newspaper Says France Plans to Build a Large Cruiser</p>
<p>Crisis in Europe Has Become Significant</p>
<p>US Delegation Returns to New York</p>
<p>London dispatch - On the day the Naval Treaty was signed, the British authorities made every effort to make the ceremony grand and solemn in order to make the world feel that the naval conference had indeed achieved something. If France does not proceed with its ship-building program, the naval plans of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan have indeed been reduced by 500,000 tons. What policy Paris adopts in the future will have a huge impact on the naval situation. The London Daily Telegraph stated on the morning of the day the Naval Treaty was signed that France intends to immediately build a 27,000-ton cruiser, equipped with eight 12-inch guns, with a continuous cruising range of at least 12,000 miles. The security clauses in the Naval Treaty state that if a country outside the three nations expands its navy, any one of the three nations that believes it affects its position has the right to increase its naval power accordingly. Political figures here admit that the failure of France and Italy to reach an agreement has made the crisis in Europe significant.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 29th - The US delegation that went to London to participate in the Naval Conference returned here this morning, escorted into port by several warships and an airship.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Gandhi Leads Anti-Liquor Movement</h3>

<p>Reuters, Bombay, 28th - Mrs. Gandhi and several female volunteers departed from Jerapur today in two large automobiles to conduct an anti-liquor movement. Before leaving, they sang the national anthem and advised those afraid of death not to go.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madras, 28th - Yesterday, police were attacked by crowds throwing stones. The police issued several warnings, but the crowds ignored them. As a result, the police opened fire, killing two and injuring three. On the police side, in addition to three senior officers being injured, almost all other officers suffered minor injuries. The most seriously injured was an Indian police officer who was stabbed in the back by a rioter.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th - The India Office sent out a document published by the Viceroy of India tonight, stating that during the deployment of troops in the North-West Frontier Province rebellion, two companies of the Jaffeer Riflemen were found to be behaving erratically. These two companies have now been stationed in Abbotabad for investigation. The Jaffeer soldiers have always had excellent battle records, having served in France and Mesopotamia during the European War and won the Victoria Cross twice. However, they are high-caste Hindus and have religious connections with Gandhi.</p>
<h3>Japan's Stance on the Korean Issue in the Three Northeastern Provinces</h3>
<p>Grant Koreans the Right to Naturalization</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch - Japan's two major goals regarding the Korean issue in the Three Northeastern Provinces have always been: 1. To stabilize the lives of existing residents; 2. To grant the possibility of immigration to those who have not yet come. However, to achieve the above plan, it is necessary to first properly resolve the diplomatic issues related to the above two major problems, such as Koreans obtaining land lease rights, residence rights, and business rights in the Three Northeastern Provinces. If these are not resolved first, then the problem will be difficult to realize. Therefore, successive Japanese governments have put great effort into this issue, but to this day, there is still no proper solution. At the same time, the voices of Chinese people opposing Koreans are getting louder and louder. Therefore, even though the Sino-Japanese commercial treaty negotiations are still underway, to fundamentally resolve the above problems, China takes the abolition of unequal treaties as its sole goal. How can there be easy agreement? Japan also deeply understands this fact and absolutely cannot implement it. Therefore, the recent general view is that the Governor-General of Korea has traditionally adopted a policy of not allowing Koreans to naturalize. Because Koreans have dual nationality, they cannot officially naturalize when China rejects them, leading to an impasse. If they are granted the right to naturalization, then Koreans living in Manchuria can officially naturalize in China and immediately obtain land lease rights, residence rights, and business rights, and their lives can be stabilized. For those who have not yet come, the existence of the above rights can be expected to attract them automatically, and foreign affairs can achieve practical results. The government should be urged to immediately order the Governor-General of Korea and the Colonial Ministry to grant Koreans the right to naturalization, so that this problem can be safely resolved. As for the Japanese intention, it is believed that the naturalization of Koreans in China does not run counter to the development of Manchuria and Mongolia. This is merely a mutated naturalization, which is essentially no different from Koreans immigrating to Manchuria. If this doctrine is implemented, the current 800,000 Koreans living in our Three Northeastern Provinces will not be able to live peacefully. If the number increases to 1.8 million, the harm will be even greater.</p>
<h3>The Spanish Constitution Problem</h3>

<h3>Attempted Bombing of the Russian Embassy</h3>
<p>Russian Government Protests to Poland</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 29th - The Soviet Russian government sent a note to Poland, accusing it of the fact that on Saturday someone attempted to destroy the Soviet Russian Embassy in Warsaw with a bomb. The note stated that the bomb was enough to kill all the personnel in the embassy. The attempt to harm Soviet Russian representatives in Poland has happened more than once. This kind of anti-Russian act is intended to provoke. The Polish government is responsible for curbing this in order to maintain diplomatic relations. According to reports, the incident was exposed when a guard in a building next to the Soviet Russian Embassy saw a strange electric lamp in the stairwell. After investigating, it was found that the wire was connected to the roof, to a clockwork mechanism in the embassy chimney, and that the mechanism contained a tube of explosives.</p>

On the morning of the 26th, they arrived in Minggang, where Shangguan Yunxiang, and other division and brigade commanders greeted them at the station. Commander-in-Chief Chiang got off the train, met with the various brigade commanders, and ordered them to follow the train to Queshan. At 12:00 PM, they arrived in Queshan. At 1:20 PM in the afternoon, the train arrived in Zhumadian for an inspection of everything. At 5:30 PM, they arrived in Luohe and inspected a certain division's troops. Chiang, He Yingqin, and He Chengjun all gave speeches, praising the spirit of the division's officers and soldiers. Finally, they went to the front line for inspection. At 8:30 PM, they hosted a banquet for the division and brigade commanders on the train, and only started heading south at 12:00 AM. At 7:35 PM on the afternoon of the 27th, they arrived in Hankou. The leading train was the Minsheng armored train. Chiang first disembarked at Madaokou. The area near the Madaokou was guarded by a battalion of soldiers from the 77th Regiment of the 13th Division and a company of the Gendarmerie Regiment. Important figures from all walks of life who came to greet him there included He Jian, Lu Dipin, Xu Yuanquan, Jiang Dingwen, Xia Douyin, Guo Rudong, Fan Shisheng, Dai Minquan, Qian Dajun, He Guoguang, Liu Wendao, Chen Shaokuan, Yin Zusheng, Chen Guangzu, and dozens of others.

<h3>He Jian and Lu Dipin Arrive in Hankou</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, and Lu Dipin, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, were both summoned to Hankou to report on the recent situation in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. He arrived in Hankou on the 27th, and Lu arrived in Hankou on the evening of the 26th. I recently visited them separately and obtained their statements as follows:</p>
<p>He Jian's Remarks: Mr. He briefly stated: "I set off at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 26th). Because there were no delays along the way, it only took one night to reach Hankou. The accompanying personnel included Liu Yinggu, Chief of Staff of the 15th Division, Peng Xi, Director of the Political Training Department, Zhong Ling, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, Hu Yinhuai, Director of Liaison of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, and liaison officer Yuan Shufeng, etc., totaling more than 20 people. This time I am here to pay respects to the Commander-in-Chief. The important tasks are to report on the most recent progress in suppressing bandits, the situation of bandit suppression in Hunan Province, the current state of military and political affairs in Hunan Province, and to request permission from the Commander-in-Chief to suppress the rebels. As for the Fourth Route Army of Guangxi, it has already passed Guilin. The Sixth and Eighth Route Armies are crossing the river. Once they are concentrated, they will take a three-sided encirclement. The resolution of the Guangxi situation is not far off. As for Yan and Feng's absurd theories, defying the great injustice of the world, it is no different from a mantis trying to stop a chariot, hastening their own demise. However, Hunan Province's dispatch of troops to participate in the suppression of the rebellion will have to await instructions from the Commander-in-Chief before it can be determined."</p>
<p>Lu Dipin's Remarks: Mr. Lu briefly stated: "Since I went to Jiangxi from Hankou last year, I have not had the opportunity to pay my respects to the Commander-in-Chief. This time, the Commander-in-Chief came to Hankou to inspect the troops in Henan. I originally planned to wait in Xunyang to pay my respects, but when I arrived in Xunyang from Nanchang, the Commander-in-Chief had already come to Hankou, so I came to Hankou to pay my respects specifically. This time, in addition to reporting on the bandit suppression situation and political situation in Jiangxi Province, I am also requesting orders to suppress the rebellion. The Yan-Feng rebellion was long expected by us. The central government's dispatch of troops to suppress it is the final battle between revolutionary forces and counter-revolutionary forces. Yan and Feng are already suspicious of each other and will soon break apart. Perhaps without the need for the central government's military conquest, they will perish. As for the bandit troubles in Jiangxi, because the Communist bandits are a kind of organized and trained force, their purpose is to anesthetize the masses, making it difficult to eradicate their roots. When I first arrived in Jiangxi, I originally planned to simultaneously encircle and suppress them with the 50th Division, the 18th Division, and the 12th Division in separate directions. Before a month had passed, the 50th Division was ordered to enter Guangdong, and the 12th Division was also ordered to open up Fujian. The only troops left in Jiangxi were the 18th Division, with which to maintain 81 counties. How could it be comprehensive? Moreover, the Zhu-Mao large bandit gangs, with thousands of rifles, appear and disappear unpredictably, suppressing them here and fleeing there. Therefore, for half a year now, the bandit troubles have still not been fundamentally eliminated. This is something I deeply regret. Now the Golden Division has returned to Jiangxi from Fujian and is being redeployed. It is expected that they will soon be able to defend southern Jiangxi. The Zhu-Mao bandit gangs occupying the Xinfeng Huichang area will be heavily attacked. The political situation in Jiangxi Province has also been affected by the Communist bandits, making it difficult to start any construction. Moreover, finances are tight, and the economy is experiencing great difficulties. Administrative expenses are insufficient, and there is no way to raise construction funds. Therefore, in terms of politics, nothing has been achieved. After paying my respects to the Commander-in-Chief, I will report all the difficulties and ask for instructions. Also, the Jiangxi Province county magistrate examination is scheduled to be held on May 1st. I must return to Jiangxi after paying my respects to the Commander-in-Chief and plan to arrive in Nanchang before May 1st." (April 28th)</p>
<h3>Japan Actively Invading the Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>Recent Plans to Operate Industries</p>
<p>Liaoning Correspondence: Japan's method of invading the Eastern Provinces is based on economic policies, and among economic policies, operating industries is the vanguard. Therefore, its investment in Manchurian and Mongolian industries is increasing year by year. According to a survey by the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in February of this year, the total investment in various industries (excluding loans) has exceeded 1 billion yuan. In the future, if the new economic policy towards Manchuria succeeds, the investment will have to be increased by several hundred million yuan, etc. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese are vigorously engaged in the operation of Manchurian industries. Here are some of the more notable ones, described separately:</p>
<p>Kwantung Government Establishes Financial Associations: The Kwantung Government is the only important agency for Japan's invasion of Manchuria. In order to promote the development of Japanese businesses in Manchuria, the government has long been planning to establish financial associations in various ports. For example, in Liaoning and Changchun, they were established this spring with the assistance of the government. Recently, with Harbin as the commercial center of North Manchuria and an important stronghold for international commercial warfare, it is urgent to establish financial institutions to help Japanese businesses extend their influence to North Manchuria. Therefore, it has allocated 1 million yuan to establish a financial association in Harbin. The establishment of this association is actually the first front line for Japan's development of North Manchuria. The importance of the relationship is self-evident.</p>
<p>South Manchuria Railway Pays Attention to Tussah Silk Industry: Tussah silk is a special product of Northeast China, second only to soybeans. The annual output is worth about 30 million yuan, and it is an important foreign trade product. The South Manchuria Railway Company attaches great importance to this. In addition to vigorously promoting breeding in the southern part of South Manchuria, it has recently hired a specialist scholar, Dr. Inoue Ryugo, to study improvement methods in order to discover its new uses, and plans to establish the largest improved silk reeling factory in the silk producing areas to defeat the silk factories operated by the Chinese. If the Japanese realize this kind of attempt, the Northeast silk industry will inevitably suffer a great blow.</p>
<p>Gan Jingzi Port is Accelerating Construction: In recent years, the trade volume of Dalian Port has increased, and there are more and more ships. The wharves are not enough to meet the demand. The South Manchuria Railway Company has specially invested millions of yuan to develop wharves in the Gan Jingzi Port area to increase handling capacity. This port project has been underway for two years. Now, in order to achieve success quickly and expand its business, it is accelerating construction even more. It is scheduled to complete the project in May, start installing machinery on June 1st, and open the port on August 1st. In the future, it can accommodate huge ships. At that time, not only will the South Manchuria Railway's cargo be prosperous, but the trade in Northeast China will also increase.</p>
<h3>Grain Crisis in Anqing Expands</h3>
<p>Citizens Gather to Seize Rice</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Recently, there has been a rice shortage in Anqing, and market prices have soared. The general poor people are feeling the inability to continue their meals. However, the rice merchants are taking advantage of this opportunity to do their best to hoard and monopolize. The price of rice changes several times a day, in order to make profits. The low-price rice sold by the people's food maintenance association is sought-after because of its lower price, and even leads to many malpractices, and the benefits are not evenly distributed. The market price of rice is 15 or 16 yuan per stone, which is rare in Anqing. As a result, the rice grabbing trend has been staged again and again. Yesterday, on the morning of the 25th, hundreds of citizens went to the food rice production and sales cooperative run by the municipal preparatory office to buy rice. The cooperative stipulated that buyers must pay a registration fee of one yuan. The public did not understand and started a great uproar. It happened that several rice carts were stopped in front of the municipal preparatory office because they could not enter the cooperative due to overcrowding. They were then looted by a large number of people. The sign, lights, and boatsheds of the municipal office were also destroyed. Wang Dewen, the clerk of the municipal office, and Chu Yunkai, the police officer, were also beaten. The citizens then flocked to Jin Youshu's private residence, the head of the municipal preparatory office, at No. 11 Lusi Bridge, and destroyed utensils and other items. The provincial government's public security brigade and the police rushed to the scene after hearing the news, and the citizens began to disperse. The citizens had previously bought by force and then looted the rice from the door of rice shops inside and outside the city. The order on the market was chaotic. The areas of San Si Pai Lou and San Bu Liang Qiao were particularly disturbed. The military and police were unable to stop it. The remaining rice shops were still robbed one after another. However, various businesses closed their doors and suspended operations due to the chaotic order. In order to maintain order, the authorities specially arrested several rice grabbers. The provincial government has also issued a proclamation to severely crack down on the situation. After the incident, it was investigated that more than 30 rice shops were robbed, including Li Qinglong at the North Gate, Zhao He at Daguaijiaotou, and Yang Renchang on Faxiao Street. Now, due to the strange rise in rice prices, the citizens are vying to buy flour to temporarily replace food. The price of each bag of flour has also risen from more than two yuan to four yuan. As a result of discussions between the provincial government and various organizations, it is proposed that the provincial disaster relief committee temporarily lend 30,000 yuan to the rice merchants, and then the business community will raise 50,000 yuan to send people to Shanghai to purchase Saigon rice or Siamese rice to help the people's food supply. At the same time, people will be sent to nearby towns and villages to dredge up rice sources, as a means of both treating the symptoms and addressing the root causes. Also, this (26th) morning, military and police teams were sent to guard each rice shop and monitor the public buying rice, so the market feels more calm. (April 26th)</p>
<h3>Detailed Account of the Bandit Robbery in Sijing Town, Songjiang</h3>
<p>Three Security Corps members dead, three wounded.</p>
<p>Four bandits dead, six or seven wounded.</p>
<p>Total losses of about 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Sijing Town, in the Songjiang jurisdiction, was looted twice by bandits on the 28th. This was briefly noted in yesterday's newspaper. Now we know that many people were killed and wounded on both sides that day. Because the town's security corps resisted for a long time, the bandits could not arbitrarily search and loot, so the losses were not very large.</p>
<p>Arrival of the Bandits: At about 3:00 PM on the 28th, the security corps received a report from their informant that there were five bandit ships coming from the west of the town, with about 100 bandits, each holding rifles and sharp blades, and a large red flag to command the bandits. Upon hearing the news, the security corps immediately sent all of its members, together with the public security team, to resist the enemy.</p>
<p>Fierce Battle for a Long Time: The two sides met in the Gongjia Port area and exchanged rifle fire. The bandits did not succeed, so they surrounded the security corps from three sides. The security corps had fewer people and could not resist. They persisted for more than an hour, firing more than 1,000 rounds of bullets, which were also exhausted. They then retreated step by step and were forced to flee for their lives. After the event, it was investigated that three security corps members were dead, three were seriously wounded, four bandits were dead, and six or seven were wounded.</p>
<p>Details of the Looting: When the merchants suddenly heard the sound of gunfire, they closed their doors one after another. Residents helped the old and carried the young and fled in all directions. There were hardly any people on the street. This time, the bandits looted and the most severely damaged businesses were Qinyu Pawnshop, Xianghe Pawnshop, Dalong General Merchandise Store, Dacheng Clothing Store, Zhengtichang Clothing Store, Yudaxiang, Yuanfengshun, Shenguangchang, Xiechangxiang, Wangshunchang, Shenyixing, Xiangshuntai, Sanxingzhai, Risheng Factory, Daxing Factory, Rifeng, Songji Clothing Store, Yitai, Dingfeng, etc., with losses of more than 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Panic: When the bandits were looting, they fired guns into the air non-stop. Because the town had been looted last year, the residents were all like frightened birds, their faces pale. The bandits did not get what they wanted, so they wanted to set fire to the east and west. In the end, because it was almost 6:00 PM, they all dispersed with shouts. It was also heard that a certain woman from Jiangbei was raped by the bandits. A carpenter surnamed someone was also killed because he was wearing a gray cloth short coat and was suspected of being a military police officer. Also, someone, the mistress of Shenyiji, was shot and killed by the bandits because she closed the store door. Also, one person, Lu Asheng, died. One person, A Rong, died. One person, Ma Azhao, was injured. One doorkeeper of Qinyu Pawnshop was injured.</p>
<p>Secret Report to Songjiang: When the security corps was engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits, the public security bureau, etc., took the opportunity to go to Songjiang, Xinqiao, and other places to ask for reinforcements. Li Wenlai, the chairman of the chamber of commerce, happened to be in Songjiang at the time. He received an urgent letter from Zhang Pinchun of Sijing and immediately went to the county government to personally report everything. The county magistrate, Jin, then assigned Luo Jimin, Yin Risheng, and others to supervise more than 100 army troops and public security police teams to rush to Sizhen Town overnight to suppress the bandits.</p>
<p>Sending Police to Pursue and Suppress: Zhang Yunfeng's department, the inspector general of the Jiangsu Water Police First Team, had about 24 water boats and more than 200 soldiers, who were suppressing bandits in Pinghu, Jinshan, Zhangyan, and other places. On the evening of the 28th, at 11:00 PM, they arrived in Minhang. When they learned of the bad news of Sijing, they rushed to Maqiao at 4:00 AM. At 7:00 AM in the morning, the entire army arrived in Sijing and immediately gathered with the various military and police forces to discuss countermeasures. It was decided that all of the county's public security team should remain in Sijing. The army and water patrol team were divided into north and south routes to attack the remaining bandits.</p>
<p>Aftermath Measures: At noon on the 29th, the district office convened a meeting and resolved the following aftermath measures: (1) Investigate the exact amount of losses and report to the county government in detail. (2) Restore the strength of the security corps as soon as possible. (3) Give a condolence payment of 200 yuan to each of the dead and wounded corps members and erect a stone tablet to praise their loyalty. (4) Issue a notice to appease the people.</p>
<p>Escaped Bandits Captured: At 2:00 PM on the 29th, a patrol boat was seized and two bandits were captured in the Beiganshan area, 18 miles from Sijing. A bandit corpse was also found in the pond of the Sijing Guandi Temple. Two suspects were also found in a certain village in the south of the Sijing Town River.</p>
<p>Going to Shanghai for Medical Treatment: Corps members Dong Jisheng, Tian Shouzhong, Xu Liang, and residents Shao Xianggong and Mao Zhaosheng all took a boat to Shanghai for medical treatment on the morning of the 29th. Dong Jisheng was shot in three places, in the shoulder, waist, and face. Tian Shouzhong was wounded in the left cheek. Xu Liang was chased by the bandits and fell and was injured on the way. Shao Xianggong and Mao Zhaosheng were wounded in the left shoulder and right shoulder, respectively, and were not seriously injured. Three security corps members died: Li Jinsheng, Li Wenbin, and Zhou Qiulong. Two were deputy squad leaders and one was a corps member.</p>
<p>Account of the Corps Members: The security corps members who went to Shanghai for medical treatment are now being treated at the Shanghai Labor Hospital on Binlang Road. According to corps member Xu Liang, he took a boat to Shanghai at about 8:00 AM yesterday morning and arrived in the afternoon. At about 3:00 PM on the 28th, the corps members were building a mud wall on the open space behind the temple. It suddenly rained, and Captain Yao ordered everyone to go inside the house to take temporary shelter. At that time, as the corps members were entering the house one after another, they suddenly heard the sound of gunfire outside the temple wall, which was quite dense. Because the corps members were all working and not carrying weapons, everyone quickly grabbed weapons to resist the enemy and fought back one after another. About 20 or 30 bandits came, holding long guns, and attacked the corps headquarters. The momentum was very fierce. The two guards at the entrance could not withstand the attack and retreated. After the two sides exchanged fire for a long time, it was suddenly seen in the fields near the graves that many more bandits emerged. The leader was holding a large red flag with the words "First Army Under Heaven" written on it. The bandits rushed to the flag. To the open space and immediately planted the flag in the ground. A corps member glimpsed this and shot the bandit holding the flag. Another</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>bandit immediately came forward to replace him and still planted the flag as before. He was also shot by a corps member. When the other bandits saw this, they were unwilling to give up and set up the flag for the third time. He was also killed by a corps member. So they gathered the bandits and rushed towards the corps headquarters together. Because the corps members were outnumbered, they fought and retreated. The bandits chased closely behind them to the riverside. The bandits fired bullets and shot the two corps members Dong and Tian, who were injured by the bandits at this time. Those who fled to the northeast were spared.</p>
<p>Searching for the Remaining Bandits: It is heard that this gang of bandits was the department of Mao Zilong, a bandit from Hunan. Fearing that reinforcements from Songjiang would arrive, they looted until 6:30 PM and then called the roll and gathered the team. They fled along the road from Dongjing through Fangjia Kiln to Qingpu. Before leaving, they dragged away four bandit corpses. However, when the Songjiang military and police arrived in the town, it was already dusk and the bandits had gone far away. They then searched for the remaining bandits. In a certain teahouse, they caught sight of a suspicious person with ragged clothes and a Jiangbei accent. After questioning, it was determined that the person's words were evasive and his behavior was suspicious. He was brought back to Song today to be sent to the county for investigation. Because County Magistrate Jin was on sick leave, the county government appointed Du Cheng, a trial officer, to take a clerk and Tao Guanlun, the director of the county public security bureau, and others to go to the countryside at 9:00 AM to investigate everything.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Security Office Actively Proceeds</h3>
<p>Inspects the Strength of the Province and Counties and Investigates Bandit Situation</p>
<p>Bandit Communists in Jiangsu are causing trouble, and the people are suffering deeply. The central government and the provincial government have long planned to establish a security office to rectify the military strength of the entire province and engage in suppression. Recently, the central government has appointed Li Mingyang, a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee, to concurrently serve as the director of the Security Office. After receiving the order, Li immediately established an office in the province to oversee matters. The location of the office was originally designated by the provincial government as the district chief training center in Fanggongqiao. Later, because the education department borrowed the location to open a mass education exhibition, the office was temporarily set up in the Guangdong Guild Hall. It will return to its original location soon. Li and the Department of Civil Affairs jointly submitted a request to the provincial government yesterday, ordering each county to report on the bandit troubles and public security situation in accordance with the distributed bandit situation report form and public security situation report form on schedule. They also ordered the provincial and county police teams and security corps to report on the current personnel, horses, weapons, and ammunition for inspection and to formulate a plan to eliminate bandit Communists throughout the province. Also, the office staff has been appointed separately. Feng Peisan is the colonel secretary, Huang Chengqian is the colonel section chief of the first section, Long Jisheng is the colonel section chief of the second section, and Tao Shixiong is the colonel section chief of the third section. There are more than 30 other section members and clerks.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Express Letter</h3>
<p>The price of rice in Hangzhou has risen to 17 yuan per stone. However, the starting price of rice is still 13 yuan and 6 jiao. The fixed price of the fair rice item is 13 yuan. Most stores do not have it in stock because they have to subsidize it. It is now scheduled to be removed on the 30th. It is also learned that each rice store has sufficient inventory in the months of May and June, and the price of rice will definitely not be increased.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association and the General Chamber of Commerce are purchasing fair rice and distributing it to various counties for sale. Currently, the counties of Xindeng, Fuyang, Zhuji, Quzhou, Deqing, Lin'an, Tonglu, and Yuhang have each received 300 bags. The Three Warehouse Committee has received 1,000 bags. The nine counties of Changhua, etc., are requesting to prepare funds for collection for fair sales.</p>
<p>The first capital repayment lottery of the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Public Bonds will be held this afternoon (29th) at the General Chamber of Commerce. Personnel from the provincial government and various departments, offices, bureaus, and institutes will be present to supervise. The winning numbers are 0541, 7579, and four numbers. Whether it is a thousand yuan, hundred yuan, or ten yuan bond, any bond with the same last two characters is a winning bond. The principal will be repaid starting from May 15th. The total amount of capital to be repaid this time is only 38,800 yuan.</p>
<p>The provincial government approved the letter from the Zhejiang Provincial Executive Committee, stating that the Anji County Party Department telegraphed requesting the dispatch of troops to protect the local area in order to prevent the influx of Lake Bandits. It has been ordered to instruct Hang Yi, the second regimental commander of the Security Office, to send a battalion or company to defend the area. (29th)</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Removal of Custodians of the Women's, Farmers', and Workers' Consolidation Association: The Kunshan County Party Affairs Consolidation Committee removed all of the custodians of the Women's, Farmers', and Workers' Consolidation Association of this county due to negligence of duty and misuse of public funds. The matter was discussed at the 45th meeting of the committee on the 18th and it was resolved to dismiss them all. The three vacant custodians of the Women's, Farmers', and Workers' Consolidation Association will be concurrently held by Zhang Pengcai, Xu Yongyi, and Chen Fengchi of the Consolidation Committee.</p>
<p>Bandit Traces in Yangcheng Lake Have Disappeared: Since the military and police severely suppressed the large gang of Lake Bandits in Yangcheng Lake, and the bandit leader Zhang Shaohua has been arrested, the remaining bandits have been disorganized. The villagers near Bacheng in the county have been spreading rumors that there are still bandits in the lake, causing several scares a night. On the previous two days, soldiers from the first battalion of the 28th Regiment stationed in Kunshan, together with six patrol boats from the Jiangsu Water Police 12th Team, departed from Bacheng to search for the remaining bandits in the Lianhuaji and Yangcheng Village areas. As a result, no bandit traces were found. They immediately returned to the team.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Request to Intercept Bandit Ships from Baihe Township: The An亭 (Anting) Security Corps under the County received a special dispatch from the Baihe Township Security Corps of Qingpu yesterday (the 28th), stating that according to a report from the Huangjia Village Office, at 7:00 AM today, seven bandit ships passed through the area heading west, and requested the dispatch of a team to Sijiangkou to intercept them. Upon receiving the report, Deputy Corps Leader Fang immediately convened an emergency meeting overnight, resolving to first dispatch scouts for reconnaissance and take appropriate action, while also submitting a request to the county government for the dispatch of troops to be stationed in the township for deterrence.</p>
<p>Statistics on the Area and Population of the Entire County: Following the reorganization of Jiading County into districts, the heads and deputy heads of towns, townships, neighborhoods, and sub-neighborhoods have been appointed. There are a total of eight districts, fourteen towns, one hundred and sixteen townships, one thousand nine hundred and fifty-two neighborhoods, and nine thousand seven hundred and sixty-five sub-neighborhoods, covering an area of six hundred and forty-seven thousand six hundred and forty-nine mu, six fen, and five li, equivalent to one thousand one hundred and ninety-nine li and zero three five one fangli. There are fifty-two thousand four hundred and seven households of residents, one thousand two hundred and forty-four households of merchants, one hundred and twenty-five thousand nine hundred and seventeen male adults, and one hundred and twenty thousand and eighty-nine female residents.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Request for Instructions Regarding Land Acquisition for County Roads: The county roads occupy an estimated area of over one thousand mu across various districts, resulting in significant losses of spring crops. This matter has been brought up for discussion by the current County Administrative Committee, which resolved that (1) the acquired farmland should be measured and priced accordingly, with taxes exempted starting from the busy season of the 19th year (of the Republic); (2) compensation and tax reductions should be granted separately for the ruined spring crops and the fragmented land on both sides; and (3) all filled-in river channels and ditches should be improved. In addition to County Magistrate Hong's special request for instructions on this matter, the joint conference on requisitioning labor for road construction has also resolved to withhold the five-fen mu donation collected for county roads in the 19th year to be used for land prices and compensation. However, it is uncertain whether this will be approved by the higher authorities.</p>
<p>Request to Apply Local Rates for Postal Districts in Towns and Townships: Ruan Shangyi, the deputy director of the Property Office, has telegraphed the Ministry of Communications and the Postal Administration regarding postal fees in towns and townships, stating that the postal charges for a township or town are calculated as if they were sent to other cities. Comparing this to the Wusong and Zhenru areas within the Shanghai Special Municipality, which are also dozens of li apart but are charged as local rates for correspondence, it is clearly unfair. Therefore, the mailing of letters to and from various towns and townships should also be calculated as local rates for fairness.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Conference on Bandit Suppression Measures by the Bandit Suppression Command: The Taihu Bandit Suppression Command convened a security conference yesterday (the 29th) at 2:00 PM at the West Encampment Headquarters, gathering heads of the Suzhou land and water public security agencies. Chief Commander Hu presided over the meeting and reported on the purpose of the conference, stating that with the concerted efforts of the bandit suppression military police, the bandits in various lakes have been largely dispersed. However, the scattered bandits still pose a threat to local areas, and active suppression should be carried out to allow the people to live in peace. It is reported that the conference resulted in two main points: (1) If any scattered bandits are encountered in the future, the heads of each township and district will be responsible for reporting and pursuing them at any time. In the urban area, patrol officers and police chiefs from each district office will be responsible for reporting at any time. (2) Preparations should be made to clean up the rural areas to ensure that bandits are completely eradicated.</p>
<p>Public Security Plan Following the Abolition of the Municipal Government: The abolition of the Suzhou Municipal Government has been ordered for several days, but the provincial order has not yet arrived. Former Mayor Lu of Suzhou, along with Police Chief Zou, went to the province the day before yesterday to request instructions on the aftermath. Chairman Ye and Director Hu personally instructed them to return to Suzhou and prepare a plan and organization for the merger of the county and city. Police Chief Zou returned to Suzhou the day before yesterday (the 27th) and convened a meeting on the 28th with the captains and section chiefs of each district office to discuss the matter. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to abolish the east and west districts among the five districts (east, south, west, north, and central) in Suzhou city, and to abolish the third sub-bureau among the fourteen sub-bureaus under the county. The city and county will be merged into fourteen sub-bureaus, with the East District Office merged into the North District Office as the first sub-bureau, the South District as the second sub-bureau, the West District merged into the Lou District as the third sub-bureau, and the remaining county sub-bureaus, such as Xuguan as the fourth sub-bureau and Mudu as the fifth sub-bureau, will remain as they were. However, the sub-bureaus will be divided into three levels: first, second, and third class, and will be assigned based on the complexity of their affairs. Some three or four of the existing county sub-bureau outposts will also be abolished and converted into watch posts. The number of police officers in each sub-bureau and outpost will also be adjusted as appropriate. The current county police force consists of three companies, which are mostly understaffed. In the future, the city security force may need to be used to supplement the number, or the county police may be merged into a large battalion. If the two public security bureaus of the county and city are merged, the clerks in each section will also need to be expanded.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Another Robbery Case at Bashi Bridge: The family of Gu Meichun, a resident of Da Chen Li near Bashi Bridge Town in the sixth district (Tianxia City), was not wealthy. However, at about 11 PM the night before last, more than twenty bandits suddenly arrived, all with black cloths wrapped around their heads. They broke down the door and tied up the women one by one. When Gu's son resisted slightly, he was injured by the bandits with sticks. The bandits rummaged through boxes and chests, looting at will, and stole about one dan of white rice and leather and silk clothing, causing a loss of about two or three hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Major Criminals Apprehended in the Tearing Up of a Kidnapping Victim Case: Qian Fenghao's infant daughter (eight months old), A Ba, of Nanrang Village, Xin'an Township, was kidnapped by bandits on the night of the 2nd of this month. Afterwards, Mr. Qian received letters from the bandits demanding a large sum of money. Unexpectedly, while negotiations were in progress, she was torn up. Ni Gusheng, the detective chief of the Second Water Police District, apprehended a main culprit in Shanghai, Zhou, and it has been learned that the captured criminal, named Lanzhai, has been escorted to Wuxi and first sent to the detective team headquarters. Knowing that he was facing a grim fate after being arrested, Zhou secretly bought a pack of cigarettes and two boxes of matches on the way. The escorting officers did not suspect anything when Zhou bought cigarettes. Unexpectedly, after being released, Zhou took the opportunity to secretly swallow both boxes of matches. After being discovered, he was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment, and no accident occurred. After strict interrogation by Detective Ni, Zhou revealed how he hired a small boat from Shi Tang (according to confirmed confessions, the boat was specifically used to transport thieves and contact accomplices in certain places). After being transferred to the Second District Headquarters yesterday, Zhang Zhaonan, the section chief of the First Section, opened a court to interrogate Zhou. Zhou suddenly retracted his confession, only admitting to fraud to obtain money. Subsequently, after further questioning by Inspector Chen Rongquan, Zhou confessed to an accomplice who is now hiding in the Xiajiabian area of Yangming. According to the confession, Mr. Chen immediately reported to District Chief Mao, who ordered Team Leader Ni to lead detectives to the countryside to arrest him. The accomplice was captured and presented to the District Headquarters for transfer to the county government for legal action.</p>
<p>Problem of the Municipal Preparatory Office Taking Over: The Wuxi Municipal Preparatory Office has been ordered to be abolished, and all matters of the Municipal Preparatory Office will be handed over to the responsible bureaus for management. A management committee will be established to take care of all municipal properties. County Magistrate Sun has been ordered to end it at the end of this month. However, all citizens in the first district believe that after the Municipal Preparatory Office is closed, the entire division into fragments will be a problem. They fear that the various undertakings that should be handled by the autonomous district will not have the effect of unifying power and will not be able to develop as much as possible. Therefore, citizens such as Hu Zhujun jointly submitted a request to County Magistrate Sun the day before yesterday, asking them to comply with public opinion and preserve the entire plan, and it has been forwarded to the Department of Civil Affairs. Yesterday, citizens also separately submitted a request to the county government, asking that municipal affairs be completely handled by the municipality in order to develop with one power. After submitting the presentation, County Magistrate Sun specially prepared another document and presented it to Director Hu, requesting instructions to follow. It is also heard that Huang Yunzhen, the county magistrate of Wu County, has received instructions from the provincial government and will come to Wuxi today (30th) to investigate the outcome of the municipal preparatory office. The Municipal Office has prepared to receive him.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Department Order on the Issue of Retention or Abolition of Tax Collection Officers: The district chiefs of Wu Yi County have been in dispute over the request to remove the field tax collection officers for a long time. Yesterday, the county government received an order from the Department of Finance, which roughly stated that the tax collection officers were to preserve the righteousness and the established rules, to urge the collection of taxes, and to manage the issuance of official contracts, which does not involve district autonomy. Now that the local guards have been abolished and the implementation law of district autonomy has been investigated, there are no regulations on the powers of the district chief regarding urging the collection of provincial and local taxes. The Finance Bureau should examine the situation and determine whether there is any way to change the administrative system and report it for further review. As for the contract tax surcharge, it should be affixed by the Finance Bureau and collected, and no district is allowed to collect it first. If there are any instances of raising the price of official contracts, collecting public security donations privately, or charging fees for stamps, the bureau should investigate and remove them. Therefore, the issue of whether to retain or abolish the tax collection officers is not easy to resolve for a while.</p>
<p>Counter-Revolutionary Case Returned for Retrial: Jiang Hewei and Xu Zuying, the counter-revolutionary criminals in the Tianning Temple rent resistance case in Wu Yi County, were previously sentenced to imprisonment during County Magistrate Zhu's tenure. Jiang and Xu were dissatisfied and appealed to the High Court. After being sent for trial, the High Court reviewed the case and returned it to the original trial court for retrial. Jiang and Xu were sent to the Wujin County Court for trial by the High Court on the 28th.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Yuan Da Public Pawnshop Stops Pledge: The Yuan Da Public Pawnshop in the south of the city suffered losses after the disaster of the Yi Chou year of the Republic (1925), and is now facing operational difficulties. It has stopped operations a few days ago and is waiting to be dealt with. Currently, there is only one pawnshop, Jimei, in Jiangyin, which is inconvenient for poor people in urgent need.</p>
<p>Striving for the Conversion of Charitable Deposits into Foreign Currency: The Education Bureau of Nantong County issued an order to the Provincial Government regarding the case of the Jiangyin Relief Home and the conversion of public funds for poor widows deposited in pawnshops into foreign currency prices. Attached to the Civil Affairs Office's presentation was a statement from Wang Ruizhang of the Jiangyin Pawnshop Association, stating that in the past year, Nan Shan School and various pawnshops settled their deposits, which were originally converted from copper coins to silver dollars. The Zhongtong method was used for conversion, with 1,780 copper coins converted to one foreign currency. Because the county's education and charity public funds deposited in pawnshops totaled more than 56,000 copper coins, it was decided by the council in 1925 that each yuan would be 1,000 copper coins. In January of this year, the County Administrative Conference re-deliberated and decided to continue handling the case. Fearing that Wang Ruizhang would fabricate facts, the Provincial Civil Affairs and Construction Departments were telegraphed to clarify.</p>
<p>Another Trial of the Sihe Tragedy: On the 28th, the county summoned Xue Picheng and Liu Deming, the victims of the Xue Shibao murder case at Sihe Tangtou Bridge, as well as Huang Youbo, Jiang Zhensheng, Xue Rongbao, and Xue Peixiu, to the court. Xue Shibao was questioned by the presiding judge Yang Ying. Xue Picheng and Liu Deming testified about the circumstances of being shot and insisted that there was no resentment. Xue Shibao confessed that it was a public crime and private grievance, intending to kill Picheng. Xue Laobao testified that Shibao surrendered himself after the incident. Huang and Youbo testified that Xue's pistol was handed over to his brother-in-law Hua Tongqing after the incident. After the trial, it was ordered that after Xue Picheng's injuries had healed, it would be determined whether there were any permanent disabilities before further trial. Xue Shibao was remanded in custody, and the others were ordered to return.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Abolition and Merger of the Construction Bureaus of Thirteen Counties: The Jiangsu Provincial Government has recently implemented a policy of reducing the scale of Jiangsu Province's politics and abolishing all agencies that are close to redundant. As the construction bureaus of various counties are mostly unable to carry out their work due to financial reasons, and are simply wasting public funds, the previous meeting decided to abolish and merge the construction bureaus of thirteen counties. The specific methods of abolition and merger are recorded as follows: (1) Jiangpu is merged into Liuhe; (2) Huaiyin is merged into Huaian; (3) Yizheng is merged into Jiangdu; (4) Qidong is merged into Chongming; (5) Yangzhou is merged into Zhenjiang; (6) Suqian and Suining are merged into Siyang; (7) Xiaoxian and Pi County are merged into Tongshan; (8) Peixian Yanshan is abolished and merged into Fengxian; (9) Guanyun and Ganyu are merged into Donghai. The funds saved after the abolition and merger will be used entirely for business construction expenses.</p>
<p>Scheduled Commencement of Zhongshan Road: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction had previously set a deadline for the demolition of houses obstructing the route for road construction. The construction of Zhongshan Road, starting from the new west gate and passing through Zhugan Lane to Ganlu Temple in the northern city, is now planned. The plan has been drawn up by Director Tang of the Engineering Office and approved by the Provincial Government. For the purpose of actively proceeding, the leveling of the ground has been scheduled for May 1st, and the groundbreaking ceremony will be held on the 3rd. All houses along the road on both sides are required to be demolished by a specified date. The completion of the road is scheduled for September 1st.</p>

<p>Officers and Men Killed and Wounded in Anti-Smuggling Operations on Four Shores: Chen Qingyuan, the camp commander of the Anti-Smuggling Camp on the four shores of Huainan, and Zhang Huashan, the captain of the box gun team, set out on a patrol. Unexpectedly, on the 26th, while patrolling the Dongmingsi area of Dinggou Township under the county, they encountered a large gang of smugglers who opened fire and resisted arrest, injuring Captain Zhang Huashan and killing Pan Keyin, a squad leader. In addition to reporting to the Huaiyun Envoy for investigation, a special report was sent to the Jiangdu County Government for joint investigation and arrest. It was also learned that on the same day, smugglers also resisted arrest on the shores of Yanghu, injuring Captain Chen of the Water Police and soldiers.</p>
<p>New Police Chief Assumes Office: The new Police Chief, An Zheng, arrived at the bureau to assume office at 2:00 PM on the 28th, and held an inauguration ceremony on the same day.</p>
<p>Detective Team Uncovers Two More Thieves: At 6:00 AM on the 28th, county detectives Sun Si, Gao Shuigui, Chen Rongzhao, and informants searched for bandit dens outside the south gate and encountered bandits who resisted arrest with hooked guns, injuring a detective's hand. The merchant corps rushed to help upon hearing the alarm. Two bandits, Xing Yushan and others, were captured on the spot, taken into custody for preliminary interrogation, and then sent for investigation.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Hu's Battalion of the Fifth Division Transfers to Tong: Due to the rampant banditry in Tongyi, the city and countryside were shaken. The Hu Xiangzao unit of the Second Battalion of the Twenty-seventh Regiment of the Fifth Division, from Haimen, heard of the situation and arrived at Sijiaba on the 28th. That night, they transferred to Tongcheng and deployed defenses along the roads. Subsequently, when bandits rioted in the Xixiang Zhentao area, Camp Commander Hu immediately dispatched a team to join the provincial and county police teams to suppress them.</p>
<p>Bank Collapse at Yaogang Riverbank: On the 28th, the riverbank in the Yaogang area was eroded by high tides, collapsing more than twenty zhang, and farmland collapsed into the river. The situation became more dangerous. Representatives from all sectors of the area went to investigate on the 29th, and the Bureau of Construction rushed to carry out emergency rescue work.</p>
<p>Bandits Seize Weapons of the Security Corps in Jinyu Town: A large group of bandits in the Jinyu Town area of the Jinle District surrounded the local security corps, forced them to hand over their weapons, and released all the corps leaders and members. Banditry in the eastern townships is even more rampant.</p>
<p>County Reporters Establish Joint Association: Reporters from all newspapers in Nantong County held a joint meeting on the 28th and elected Cai Guohua, Sun Zizai, Zhang Qingyu, Yi Zongliu, and Shao Boyan as executive committee members. It was decided to divide all members into six teams to solicit one million yuan in joint association funds from all sectors.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>

<p>Large Batch of Sago Will Soon Arrive in Yong: A wealthy man in Yong City believes that the soaring rice prices in recent years have had a serious impact on the lives of ordinary people, so he specially purchased 100,000 shi of rice from Saigon to help the people. Because he did not want to come forward, he contacted rice merchants and agreed to provide the rice to the rice merchants at the original price, and the rice merchants were not allowed to sell it for more than the original price. It is heard that the Saigon rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday, totaling more than 38,000 bags. After rice merchants in Hangzhou took away 17,000 bags, the rest can be transported to Yong soon.

Recently, Qiu Jingni, Zheng Hongnian, and Zhao Naichuan were also hired as standing committee members of the Overseas Chinese Education Design Council (Zhao is a member of the Ministry and does not need to be hired by letter, but by order). In addition, Ji Jing was hired as a member.</p>
<h3>Regulations on Submitting Newly Published Books</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has formulated six regulations on submitting newly published books. After the announcement, all regulations on submitting newly published books previously announced by universities and colleges should be repealed. The original text of the regulations is as follows: Article 1: When a book is newly published, the publisher must submit four copies of the book to the Provincial Department of Education or the Special Municipality Education Bureau (where the publisher is located) within two months from the date of publication. The submission of the aforementioned books shall be the responsibility of the Provincial Departments of Education and the Special Municipality Education Bureaus. Article 2: After the Provincial Departments of Education and the Special Municipality Education Bureaus receive the books submitted by the publisher, they shall retain one copy and forward the remaining three copies to the Ministry of Education. Article 3: After the Ministry of Education receives the submitted books, it shall send them to the Ministry of Education Library, the Central Education Hall, and the Central Library for preservation (before the establishment of the Central Education Hall and the Central Library, they will be temporarily preserved by the Ministry of Education Library), and the book title, publisher's name, and publication date will be published in the Ministry of Education Gazette.

<h3>The Yang Family Collection of Books in Liaocheng, Shandong, Has Been Preserved</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, considering the value of the Yang family collection of books in Liaocheng, Shandong, ordered the Shandong Department of Education to find a way to preserve it. Subsequently, the Shandong Department of Education reported that the Yang family's Haiyuan Pavilion collection in Liaocheng contains many old Song and Yuan editions, fine copies, and famous schools of no less than hundreds of thousands of volumes, which are related to our country's culture and the essence of the nation. After receiving the telegram order to intercept the Yang family collection from being transported out of Liaocheng, the department sent officials to investigate. However, due to the investigation of the book owner Yang Chengxun in Tianjin, the investigation was not thorough, and the situation of reselling could not be avoided. In October of last year, the department obtained approval from the provincial government to order Wang Xiantang, the director of the Provincial Library, to cooperate with the Liaocheng County Magistrate and local groups to be responsible for investigating and registering the Yang family collection in detail. According to the reply, many of the Yang family's collections had been sold before, and many had been lost due to the subsequent turmoil. To date, there are still more than 200,000 volumes. Considering the rampant banditry in the county, the city has been captured several times in the past year, and the loss of ancient books is worrisome. Therefore, in November 1929, the department submitted a proposal to the Standing Committee of the Provincial Government, which decided to order the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Education to jointly build the Haiyuan Pavilion in the Zhongshan Hall, and to send personnel to transport the Yang family collection for safekeeping. However, as the project cannot be completed in a short period of time, it will be temporarily stored in the Provincial Library. After the construction is completed, it will be moved in. It is also planned to formulate transportation and storage measures and submit them to the provincial government, which will jointly order the Liaocheng County Magistrate, the Director of the Provincial Library, the Director of the Liaocheng Education Bureau, the inspectors of the Department of Civil Affairs, and the principals of the second middle school and three normal schools in the area to be responsible for checking, registering, installing, transporting, and other matters in accordance with temporary measures, and to allocate temporary funds of 1,700 yuan. They are now actively handling the matter in order to transport it to the province as soon as possible. The plan to build the Haiyuan Pavilion separately in the future is also being carefully planned to ensure its appropriateness and permanence. The Ministry of Education instructed the department: "The presentation and attachments have been noted. The temporary measures for transporting and storing the Yang family collection are considered appropriate and should be approved for record. However, the actual number of books still needs to be reported separately after compiling the catalog." Comply with the attachments and save them for future reference.</p>

<h3>Chinese Botanist to Study in Europe</h3>
<p>Mr. Qin Renchang Departs Yesterday</p>
<p>Qin Renchang, a botanical technician at the National Museum of Natural History of the Academia Sinica, has been studying Chinese plants for nearly a decade and has profound achievements. Although young, he has made great contributions to plant science. In 1923, the National Geographic Society of Washington, D.C., sent personnel to our country to organize scientific surveys and collect plants. Later, entrusted by the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University and the former Department of Biology of National Southeast University, he went to eastern China, such as Zhejiang, Anhui, and Fujian provinces, to collect plants for five years. His footprints have been across more than ten provinces, and he has discovered many new species and genera of plants. Later, he was hired by the Department of Biology of Southeast University and the current Department of Botany of National Central University as a lecturer in botany. Seventeen years ago, the University Council organized the Guangxi Scientific Survey Team and hired him to be in charge of the plant survey. He completed his work after eight months. The following year, the Preparatory Office of the National Museum of Natural History of the Academia Sinica was established, and he was hired as a botanical technician, specializing in research and concurrently managing preparatory matters. In less than two years, all departments are well-organized. Mr. Qin has published many works on plants in recent years, scattered in the publications of academic research institutions at home and abroad. His greatest work is (Complete Flora of Chinese Ferns), which took five years to complete, totaling about 500 pages, forming a large volume, which is indeed a monumental work in the domestic botanical field. However, he still believes that his academic ability is insufficient. Now, he is going to museums and herbariums in various European countries at his own expense to study Chinese plants and to inspect the organization of academic research institutions in various countries. The Academia Sinica has sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting the issuance of a government official passport, which has been signed by the consuls of various countries in Shanghai and entrusted to the China Travel Service for booking. He will depart from Shanghai for Europe on the 29th of this month on the Nissho Maru. It is said that his itinerary in Europe will first go to the Museum of Copenhagen in Denmark, followed by the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland, and Sweden. At the same time, entrusted by the Academia Sinica, he will represent the academy at the Fifth World Botanical Congress to be held at the University of Cambridge in England in August this year. China's participation in this conference has started from now on. Mr. Qin's trip is expected to last two to three years. It is expected that he will make great contributions to the Chinese botanical community upon his return.</p>
<h3>Jinda Chinese Language and Literature Department Implements Tutorial System</h3>
<p>The Chinese Language and Literature Department of National Jinan University has always been reputable. Since Chen Zhongfan became the director, the curriculum has become more complete.

After discussing with Dean Chen, they reorganized everything and made many more arrangements, especially emphasizing after-school guidance and setting many more topics. During each term examination, many students' test papers were over tens of thousands of words. This term, the tutorial system was re-implemented, and students joined very enthusiastically. The purpose is to make teachers and students as close as family members and brothers. In addition to academics, they will have considerable discussions on emotions, personality, dealing with the world, and careers.</p>

<h3>Far Eastern Table Tennis Competition Still to Be Held</h3>
<p>But Unrelated to the Games</p>
<p>China Will Hold a Meeting to Discuss</p>
<p>The 9th Far Eastern Games will be held in Tokyo, Japan. Table tennis, which was originally listed as a demonstration sport in the games, as seen in the previous games, was suspended by the organizers due to internal disputes over the team's selection and players' eligibility on the Japanese side. However, the Japanese table tennis community, in order to maintain national honor and promote the spirit of the sport, has once again telegraphed the All-China Table Tennis Federation, requesting our country's participation to show the spirit of continued promotion. Therefore, the 2nd Far Eastern Table Tennis Championship has been decided to be held, but it is unrelated to the Games. The competition dates are set for May 25, 26, and June 2. May 25 is for team competition, and May 26 is for individual competition. The team will consist of five players and one official. The prizes include a large silver tripod donated by Count Arima, in addition to many other prizes. The All-China Table Tennis Federation, due to the importance of the matter, must carefully consider it in order to demonstrate the purpose of promoting table tennis. After receiving the letter, Lin Zecang, Yu Binqi, Wu Maoqing, Zhang Yongren, Wang Mengnian, Hu Tiewu, Wang Xiawen, and others have already held one meeting, and it is said that another meeting will be held in the coming days to discuss the matter.</p>

<p>There are two overall championships this time, one for track and field and one for tennis. There are also two small championships, one for the individual track and field and one for the relay race. In terms of strength, Hujiang and Soochow have the potential to win the championship in history. However, in the track and field events, Cheng Jinguan of Yancheng is expected to win the individual championships in the 100m, 200m, and low hurdles. Therefore, he has a better chance of winning the individual championship. However, the team championship seems to require effort to compete for.</p>
<p>In terms of tennis, Yu Tianguang and his peers of Hujiang are famous in Shanghai. Although Mingqiang and Soochow seem to have an advantage in the preliminary round, the championship will probably belong to Hujiang.</p>

<h3>Japanese Reckless Speculation on Football Championship</h3>
<p>Maintain the Runner-up Honor of the 8th Games</p>
<p>Look Down Upon Chinese Compatriots, Should Strive Hard</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese football has never shown its face at the Far Eastern Games. The eighth time in Shanghai, they broke through the Philippine army to rank second, which was originally a breakthrough stroke of luck. However, the Japanese are proud of this. They have even begun to recklessly imagine about this championship and disregard the facts to belittle our country. The following are the remarks of the main players of the Japanese football team, which can be used as a general representation. Although they are reckless remarks, they are very sufficient to urge our attention. Japanese football, which has been repeatedly defeated in previous sessions, has been reborn due to the victory in the eighth conference. The research and advancement of the past two years and the promotion of the Football Association have resulted in the current 19 strong reserve players. They are all first-class players and are by no means weaker than the Chinese and Philippine players in any way. Although the Chinese team, which has won for many years, still hopes to maintain its championship, and the Philippine army also expects to wash away its old shame, it is indeed expected that the advanced and elite Japanese team will make a surprising victory in the future.</p>
<p>The Chinese team has always relied on individual strengths to win. The activity of its individuals, such as the proficiency of dribbling, the speed of carrying the ball, the stability of the foot, the skill of kicking, and the flexibility of avoiding enemies, are indeed not as good as the Japanese and Philippines. It is no exaggeration to say that it belongs to tradition and innate. However, these simple advantages are by no means the only conditions for winning football today. Therefore, the old-fashioned Chinese team may not be able to be as arrogant as in the past this time. The advantages of the Philippine army are in proper contact and the whole team is united. Their desperate efforts are especially rare. These are the elements of football victory and also the places where China is not as good as the Philippines. Therefore, any cynical commentary that belittles the Philippine army this time is wrong. Although China and the Philippines are equally difficult to prepare teams, we would rather believe that the Philippine army is difficult to attack and deny that the Chinese team is not easy to break.</p>
<p>Japan has recruited first-class players from all over the country and has two months of joint training, which will surely become one of the strongest teams. In addition, China and the Philippines do not have the geographical advantage, and they are in a better position to compete with China and the Philippines. However, in the international confrontation conference, the spirit and attitude of the players are just as important as their skills. Experienced players who are calm in the face of adversity can develop even mediocre skills to the fullest. This is what Japanese team members should pay special attention to during training.</p>
<p>Speaking of defeating the Chinese team, there is also a wonderful method, which is to oppress and subdue them in one go from the beginning of the game and not let them take a slight advantage, because the Chinese team often takes advantage of a favorable situation and will exert its strength beyond its actual strength and go smoothly. On the contrary, it will be devastated and defeated like a bamboo shoot. This is naturally a phenomenon that a rabble must have.</p>
<p>The reporter noted that although Japanese football has made great progress in recent years, its strength is still not enough to be an enemy of our country. The above is naturally a statement to encourage their players. However, the criticism of others can at least help us improve and encourage ourselves. I hope our country's players will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Public Leisure Basketball Team Wins Xianshi</h3>

<h3>China Tennis Association News</h3>
<p>The China Tennis Association, organized by the National Sports Promotion Association, was originally scheduled to start playing in May. However, due to participating in the Far East players' practice and the grass on the grass tennis court has not yet grown well (only three hard courts are still suitable), the start date must be postponed. Around mid-May, the lawn should be able to be used. The official start date will be announced again. However, members who wish to join can register and pay the fee at the Promotion Association on the Observatory Road from today.</p>

<h3>Junyi Middle School Basketball News</h3>
<p>Junyi Middle School on Guohuo Road in this city has always been very particular about sports. It has organized school basketball teams, tennis teams, teacher-student basketball and tennis teams, and table tennis team competitions. These are held several times a week. Yesterday, the school's basketball team and the Jianguo Middle School basketball team played a friendly match on the school's basketball court. Zhang Nianzu, the school's physical education teacher, was the notary. At the sound of the silver horn, both sides were exceptionally brave. As a result, the score was 14 to 11. Victory belongs to Junyi.</p>

<h3>Tomorrow is May 1st Labor Day</h3>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Authorities Take Strict Precautions</p>
<p>The Labor Community Will Have a Day Off</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the May 1st Labor Day Memorial Day. The Chinese and concession authorities are afraid that reactionary elements will take the opportunity to take action and have to take strict precautions. The various things I have heard are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Labor Unions Are Not Allowed to Assemble</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is May 1st, World Labor Day Memorial Day. The Central Government stipulates that workers in all factories will have a day off on this day. The Civil Training Association and the Social Bureau have jointly issued an announcement that workers in the transportation, public utilities, news, and transportation industries will not stop work and will be paid double wages. All other factories will stop work for one day to express their commemoration. All wages on that day will still be paid in full by the respective factories. As for the decision of the May Day Memorial Festival Committee, in addition to sending representatives to attend the May Day Festival, labor unions are not allowed to hold meetings on their own.

Xiong personally came out to greet them and specially prepared betel nuts to show his respect. The two sides had a long talk and discussed the stationing of troops and security issues at the border between China and France. Xiong first said briefly that all reactionary factions are now hiding in the concession and carrying out secret activities. He asked the commander and chief inspector to take strict precautions. Mai and Gan replied that in recent days, several important reactionary agencies have been seized in the concession, and the May 1st plan of the reactionary factions can be invisibly eliminated. Even in the future, various anniversaries in May can be safe and normal. As for the large number of troublemakers arrested by the patrol room, they have all been transferred to your department for handling. Xiong expressed his gratitude and asked Mai and Gan to continue to cooperate in the spirit of security in the Chinese and French concessions in the future to achieve complete success. The two sides talked for about an hour, and the host and guests parted happily. Xiong also specially organized a team to play music to welcome and send them off.</p>

As for the political aspect of Shandong, there has indeed been progress. All exorbitant taxes have been completely eliminated, and the use of people and administration have generally been on the right track, which is truly commendable.</p>

At 9 am yesterday, Takamatsu and his wife were welcomed by Chongguang and others and took the Jinling Maru small wheel to land in front of the Japanese Consulate General at the Huangpu Pier.

This time was just one of these routine actions, just as the envoys of various countries stationed in Washington often visited the State Department. As for the issue of consular jurisdiction, any kind of steps will be agreed upon in Washington. The negotiations in Washington are already two years old and will continue in the future. He also said that he may often travel between Shanghai and Nanjing.</p>

<h3>Yesterday, Li Yanshi and Shen Sifang Sailed Abroad</h3>
<p>The three major electricity industry groups held a farewell banquet the night before</p>
<p>Li Yanshi and Shen Sifang, representatives dispatched by the National Private Electricity Industry Federation to attend the Second World Power Conference, set sail yesterday (29th) at 3:00 PM on the German ship Derflinger. Among those seeing them off at the port were Chen Aishi, Shen Tianxin, Gao Shuan, and dozens of others. The ship is scheduled to set sail at 4:00 AM this morning. The National Private Electricity Industry Federation, the Shanghai Special City Public Utilities Federation, and the Jiangsu Provincial Private Electricity Industry Federation, three groups, held a farewell banquet for the two representatives, Li and Shen, at the Atlantic the night before to express their well wishes. Guests who attended included Lu Bohong, Guo Zhicheng, Ding Chunzhi, Wu Shizhao, Ye Yangwu, Zhu Kongjia, Xu Dongren, Ming Zaichen, Weng Yousan, Han Yimin, Tang Jingshou, Wu Quesheng, Zhang Hongqing, Wang Yubo, Xia Zemin, Ruan Baochuan, Zhi Bingyuan, Zhao Fusheng, Jiang Guicha, Gao Shuan, Zhang Haidong, Ding Nanzhou, Zhou Xinfu, Jiang Tiaosheng, Wu Jingqi, Wu Zhiren, Gao Leqin, Li Wenzhi, Yang Boan, and over forty others. Halfway through the banquet, Chairman Lu Bohong rose and briefly stated that this World Power Conference is of utmost importance to the future improvement of the electricity industry and the trends of private electricity industries. Representatives Li and Shen have considerable history and experience in the Chinese electrical industry. They are undertaking a major mission in going to Germany to attend. I know that after they return to China, they will make many contributions to console the expectations of their colleagues. I am but a member of the electricity industry, and due to my duties, I cannot follow Representatives Li and Shen to attend. I deeply regret this. Please all raise a glass and wish Representatives Li and Shen a safe journey. Chairman Guo Zhicheng then delivered a speech, briefly stating that his colleagues are gathered here today to bid farewell to Representatives Li and Shen, nominated by this association to attend the Power Conference in Germany. He felt honored by their presence. The colleagues of this association have several hopes for Representatives Li and Shen: (1) Europe and America are advanced countries in the electricity industry, while China's private electricity industry is still in its infancy. The two representatives should be requested to contribute their insights from their observations of the German electricity industry to their colleagues as a standard for improvement. (2) Although China's private electricity industry has already united, for the sake of collective wisdom and benefit, the two representatives should, in addition to attending the conference, contact private electricity industries in Europe and America to organize an international electricity industry federation, working together to consolidate the foundation of our private electricity industry. (3) China's private electricity industry has gradually improved recently and is no longer as stagnant as in the past. In the future, reform will proceed sequentially, and commercial management will certainly not be weaker than government management. During this transitional process, the two representatives should investigate the comparison between private and government-run electricity industries in various European and American countries and the regulations established by the governments of those countries for private electricity industries for reference. Fortunately, Representative Li is a legal expert, and he should collect the electrical regulations of various countries on this trip to engage in research for reference. Next, Li Yanshi delivered a speech, briefly stating that he had just listened to the great remarks of Mr. Lu and Mr. Guo, which were very encouraging. He felt grateful and ashamed. His purpose in going to Germany this time is because the domestic electrical regulations are not yet perfect, which poses many obstacles to the future of public utilities. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct research with legal experts from various countries to solve them together. Regarding the trend of government and commercial management, he met with representatives of the American electricity industry yesterday to discuss this and learned that 80% of the industry in that country is now commercially managed. This is the trend, and China should catch up quickly and not give up. Moreover, Shanghai is the sixth largest commercial port in the world, and the reform of private electricity industries and the regulation of electricity supply among colleagues should be initiated first as an example for the whole country. Next, Shen Sifang delivered a speech, briefly stating that the private electricity industry had no unity in the past. Since being forced by the environment last year, colleagues across the country have had organizations of federations. At one time, they rose up, and now, in addition to the National Private Electricity Industry Federation, there are more than ten branch associations in various provinces and cities. It can be said that all private electricity industries are spiritually united. He should go a step further to achieve material contact. In his opinion, to improve electrical equipment and promote engineering connections, the regulation of electricity supply for colleagues is an urgent plan. Now the Zhejiang Electricity Federation has already held meetings, made decisions, and is in progress to establish the West Zhejiang power grid, and the preparatory staff have been appointed to start with on-the-spot measurements. If various provinces and cities can follow suit and extend it to the whole country to complete the great cause of electrical construction in the period of political tutelage, it is hoped for those present. After his colleagues go abroad, the results of all meetings and the news obtained from the investigation will be reported to you at any time. He is very grateful to be able to gather with you today.</p>
<h3>Edward Responds to the Five Chinese Directors</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council did not receive the list of new Chinese directors when it held a meeting</p>
<p>Edward, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, replied yesterday to a letter from Chinese Director Yuan Ludeng, stating: Dear Sir, I have received a letter co-signed by you and Messrs. Yu (Qiaqing), Xu (Xinliu), Bei (Songsun), and Liu (Hongsheng) on April 19, regarding the failure to notify the Chinese directors of the new board meeting of the Municipal Council at 12:00 on April 17, which raises a protest. I did not receive a formal notification regarding the list of newly elected Chinese directors when the meeting was held. Therefore, it was not convenient to distribute the meeting notice. I am writing to inform you of this and hope that you will inform the co-signatories. Yuan Ludeng, Edward.</p>
<h3>The Westerners' Special Meeting Is Not Optimistic</h3>
<p>The Japanese Efforts and Attitude</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that the Public Concession's Municipal Council has scheduled a special meeting of Western ratepayers at 5:30 PM on the 2nd of next month to reconsider the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors. As a result of the consistent efforts of Chinese and foreign authorities, the proposal has a likely chance of being approved by a majority. However, according to news from the foreign side, it is still uncertain whether a majority of ratepayers with voting rights will be able to attend to meet the legal quorum on the day of the meeting, apart from the majority of onlookers. The attitude of the Japanese ratepayers, who are most closely involved, is also noteworthy. On the previous two days, Japanese ratepayers in the concession held two meetings to exchange views and solicit unified opinions on the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors. However, the number of attendees was small, and a few expressed doubts and opposition. Directors Fukushima and Saito, and the Chairman of the United Association, Hayashi Yukichi, are making every effort to make contact and negotiate under the orders of Consul General Shigemitsu. It is still unpredictable what the outcome will be. To ensure that the number of attendees is sufficient and that the proposal is successfully passed, the efforts of the Chinese ratepayers are still required.</p>
<h3>The High Court Received Files from the Appeals Bureau Yesterday</h3>
<p>A total of twenty-four cases</p>
<p>After Chen Shiguang, the director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, received an order from the ministry to transfer the unsettled cases from the former Sino-Foreign Appeals Bureau to the management of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, Director Chen immediately ordered the file manager, Cheng Dahuan, to collect the files in advance for transfer. It is learned that Xu Weizhen, the president of the High Court, specially sent two clerks, Luo Wenyu and Qian Qizhong, to the Maple Bridge Office at 3:30 PM yesterday. Cheng, the file manager, handed over all the files, totaling 1132 to 1155, a total of twenty-four cases.</p>
<h3>Another Batch of Chinese Merchants Returning from Japan</h3>
<p>A total of nineteen people</p>
<p>Yang Wenhe, Chen Wenzheng, Chen Xiqing, Lin Youcheng, Yang Shengjin, Yang Yuzhen, Lin Xuekai, Jiang Yongti, Dong Qingsheng, Zhang Xiaokang, Kong Le, Zhou Defu, Yang Deen, Xu Xiaosuo, and Hu Xinfa, nineteen Chinese restaurant merchants, kimono merchants, and barbers who went to Yokohama, Tokyo, Chiba Town, Mashima Town, and Shimoha Town in Japan, were rejected by the Japanese due to non-compliance with entry procedures. They were not allowed to land and were immediately sent back to China on Japanese ships. The Chinese merchants have already returned to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Tram and Bus Strike Updates Yesterday</h3>
<p>No hope of easing before May Day</p>
<p>Since the strike of the Public Concession's tram and bus workers, the bus workers once sent representatives to negotiate with the company, but the talks stalled. The tram workers also sent representatives to negotiate with the company, but the company was not sincere in engaging, so the negotiations did not begin and they withdrew. There was no new development to report yesterday. The tram workers did not send other representatives yesterday. The bus company currently employs 38 Russians to drive, but only 15 have obtained driving licenses from the Municipal Council. There is also a Russian who had fingerprints left at the police station due to a previous case, so he did not obtain a license. It is expected that there is no hope of resolving the strike before May Day.</p>
<h3>Grain Merchants Telegraph to the Railway Department to Open Special Grain Trains</h3>
<p>The grain industry telegraphed to the Railway Department: Minister Sun of the Nanjing Railway Department, I respectfully inform you that the autumn harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces last year was exceptionally poor. The people's food in various places almost entirely relies on the foreign rice transshipped from Shanghai to provide relief. The main pivot of this transshipment and circulation depends on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. However, at present, the foreign rice and miscellaneous grains in the warehouses of the two lines are piled up like mountains. Not only are the rice merchants suffering losses, but the supply of food to the interior is also on the verge of being cut off. The state of panic is unbearable to imagine. I dare to telegraph you, sir, to value the people's food as important and quickly order the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureaus to rush to dispatch vehicles to completely transport these accumulated goods within a week. May and June are the months when the old crop is running out and the new crop is not yet in. The transportation of grain is even more urgent. I also implore you to order the bureau to add special trains for miscellaneous grains every day in May and June to transport grain and other goods, so that the accumulated goods can circulate and the demand for grain in the provinces can be supplied continuously. This matter concerns the people's food. Please implement it quickly. I await your urgent orders. Shanghai Special City Chinese Grain and Oilseed Cake Trade Reorganization Committee, bowing.</p>
<h3>The Red Cross Congress Closed Yesterday</h3>
<p>The current election will have government representatives open the ballots</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society held an election the day before. Yesterday morning, the Municipal Party Department sent Supervisory Committee member Wang Yansong as a representative to supervise the opening of the ballots. Ye Zhisheng, a member of the election preparation committee, received him. Mr. Wang said that the Municipal Party Department is aware that the representatives of various counties are paying attention to this election and attach great importance to it. Therefore, it specially sent him as a representative. He met Mr. Guang Qiaqing a few days ago, who also said that the preparation for the election at this congress shows that the representatives are paying attention to electing talent according to law and reforming the society's affairs, which is gratifying. Mr. Ye replied that the government has not yet sent personnel to the meeting. The preparatory committee, for the sake of prudence, should wait for the personnel to arrive before opening the ballots. Mr. Wang said that if the government's personnel are telegraphed to arrive, they can be notified to attend at any time. In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, the tenth congress continued to be held. The representatives have been in Shanghai for many days and cannot wait any longer. In addition to entrusting the responsibility of opening the meeting to the Congress Preparation Election Committee and the previously selected ballot counters, they added Li Zhenbang, Wang Lisan, Lu Shuji, Li Naishuang, and Xu Xichun, five people, as ballot counters, and discussed other cases. They also took a group photo outside the venue, and the members of the Preparation Election Committee took another group photo as a souvenir. Next, Wu Wei proposed that a closing ceremony be held. Wang Peiyuan, chairman of the congress presidium, took the stage to report that the government's representatives should supervise the opening of the ballots for this election and that the congress has entrusted the Preparation Election Committee to handle the matter together with the ballot counters. The Congress Preparation Election Committee should notify the meeting to be held on another day after the ballot opening procedures are completed. Then, he led the shouting of the congress slogan and announced the closing of the meeting. However, the Congress Preparation Election Committee must wait until the ballot opening procedures are completed before it can be legally dissolved.</p>
<h3>British Merchants Expand Shipping to China</h3>
<p>Blue Funnel Line Sends Thirty Ships to China</p>
<p>The competition among companies on the Central European route is quite fierce this year. Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) has built two 11,000-ton motor ships, the Terukuni Maru and the Yasukuni Maru, which will be in service next month. The Blue Funnel Line is also building motor giants that will soon be completed and come to China. In this wave of competition, the British Blue Star Line will also open a new Central European route to China to compete for China's export business. The information I have heard is recorded below:</p>
<p>Sending 30 Ships to the Far East Blue Star Line sent ships to China before 1917 to open European routes, which were later suspended. Only one or two ships were sent to Nanjing each year to load goods for Jardine Matheson. The company's business focuses on the South African route. Now, because many Chinese fresh eggs are shipped to Europe and Japan, and Blue Star ships' refrigerated compartments are famous in Europe and are larger than other companies' ships, they have come to China to open a new route dedicated to European lines. They have established a branch in Nanjing Road, Shanghai, and appointed Tang Huatao as the manager. A total of 30 giant ships will be sent to China, with a total tonnage of 250,000 tons.</p>
<p>Status of Shipping Business The first batch of six ships has been assigned to Shanghai, and the first to arrive in Shanghai is the Deggema Star, which can be imported today and will depart for England on the first trip on May 3. The second ship, the Alphen Star, is expected to arrive in Shanghai next month. The remaining ships, such as the Doric Star, Lauristan Star, Trelissick Star, and Fremantle Star, are all large ships of 8,000 net tons. One ship will sail each month in the future. The route has been determined to be from Shanghai via Hong Kong, Singapore, Penang, Port Said to London, and also to the Netherlands and Germany, with Liverpool as the final point.</p>
<p>Adding Passenger Ships Next Year At the beginning of the launch, the business will utilize the refrigerated compartments to transport large quantities of Chinese fresh eggs for export, and also to load various sundries to Europe. Passenger mail ships will be added to the Sino-British route in the spring of next year. As for the export goods of Jardine Matheson in Nanjing, they will still be transported by the company's ships. After the news that the company will send 30 ships to sail to China spreads, it will trigger extreme competition among British and Japanese shipping companies on the European route.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Shipping Updates</h3>
<p>De Xing and Chang An Encountered Danger The De Xing and Chang An ships of the Sanbei Company were sailing to the Shayi area of the upper Yangtze River. When the ships reached the Jianli area above Chenglingji, they encountered great difficulty in sailing due to the reduced river water. They ran aground on the river surface at the same time. After telegraphing to the Hankou branch, a small tugboat was specially dispatched to tow them. Yesterday, the company received a telegram from Hankou saying that the two ships had been towed out of the shoals during high tide, and the hulls were fortunately undamaged. They have now been towed back to Hankou.</p>
<p>British Ships Gather in Yichang Waiting to Sail The British upper Yangtze River ships, which had been suspended in Shanghai due to the Jiang Ling strike, are now sailing away from Shanghai one after another. Yesterday, a telegram came from Yichang stating that the British merchants had not fully accepted the Jiang Ling's request for increased wages. Therefore, the Jiang Ling had not yet returned to work on the ships. The Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships on the Chongqing-Yichang routes are all moored in Yichang. As soon as the wage increase conditions are signed, they will set sail for Chongqing.</p>
<p>Emei Resumes Sailing on the Sichuan River The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's upper Yangtze River ship Emei has now returned to Shanghai for major repairs and has been completed. It has been decided to resume sailing on the Sichuan River route. A large number of goods for Sichuan have been delayed in Shanghai. Therefore, yesterday, the Emei ship loaded a total of 1,588 bales of cotton yarn, and the freight revenue was over 20,000 taels, which is the most difficult to obtain among Chinese merchant river ships. It is permitted to sail upstream today. The bureau has telegraphed the headquarters to instruct military police in all areas to provide protection.</p>
<h3>American Mail Ship President Polk Caught Fire</h3>
<p>Fire in the Cargo Hold of the Polk Ship The World class mail ship President Polk of the American Dollar Steamship Lines came to Shanghai from New York this time. The ship carried a lot of cargo, including 2,039 large timbers and more than 10,000 pieces of cargo to Shanghai. When the ship was nearing Kobe, a fire suddenly broke out in the number one and two cargo holds of the ship. When the flames broke through the surface of the hold, the crew immediately became aware and urgently reported to the ship's owner. All the sailors were summoned to put out the fire. Because the ship was well-equipped, in addition to using water to put out the fire, chemical water was also used to attack the fire. The flames were prevented from spreading, so the fire was extinguished soon. The other cargo holds were not affected due to the separation.</p>
<p>Shanghai Cargo to be Salvaged After the ship arrived in Shanghai, it berthed at the Pudong Bailianjing Pier. Some of the cargo in the burning number one and two holds was destined for Shanghai. The burnt cargo was part of the surface cargo. The cargo in the lower hold was not greatly damaged. However, due to the use of water to put out the fire, the cargo was mostly soaked. Yesterday, the company unloaded the cargo and notified the customers to first salvage the cargo and collect 15% of the estimated value of the cargo as salvage fees. The damaged cargo will be assessed by a surveyor at the Bailianjing Pier before the losses are calculated. The hull was not damaged, so it can still sail as usual today.</p>

<h3>Tang Zairu Escapes Danger</h3>
<p>Three bandits openly went to Tang's office</p>
<p>To collect the reward and leave triumphantly</p>
<p>Buying off the guards in a small boat</p>
<p>Rocking back to Shanghai from Pudong</p>
<p>Tang Zairu managed to escape calmly</p>
<p>One bandit was detained only yesterday morning</p>
<p>Tang Zairu, from Huzhou, lives at 617 and a half Fukang Lane, west end of Carter Road, Xinzha Road, Shanghai. He works at the Bank of Communications on the Bund and is also a broker at No. 43 of the Chinese Merchants' Yarn and Cloth Exchange. On the morning of the 21st of this month, at 9:00 AM, he planned to take his own car, No. 4514, to the office, but unexpectedly encountered four kidnappers at the alley entrance. They shot and injured the driver, Lu Yonglin, and kidnapped the victim. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Now that Tang has been released on the 27th, the reporter's findings are recorded below.</p>
<p>Holding the Hostage Temporarily in a Small Inn The hostage Tang Zairu was kidnapped on the morning of the 21st and was driven directly to Difeng Road in western Shanghai by one of the bandits. After pushing the injured driver out of the car, they continued west and then turned back to Edward Road. The hostage Tang Zairu was temporarily held in a small inn at the Dongxin Bridge intersection and guarded by three bandits. One bandit drove Tang's original car, No. 4514, to Pingjili Road in the French Concession. Then one bandit came back, looking composed, and the other bandits were overjoyed.</p>
<p>Wearing Sunglasses to Avoid Attention Tang Zairu was trapped in the small inn, unable to advance or retreat. After a short time, one bandit went out. Two hours later, the three bandits put sunglasses on Tang's nose and took him out. When walking, they told him to walk well, probably to avoid attracting the attention of passersby and arousing suspicion. After leaving the small inn, they got into a hooded car and sped west.</p>
<p>Two Female Bandits Carried Out Surveillance When the car reached Haig Road in western Shanghai, they entered a house and were greeted by two female bandits. After entering the room, they took him upstairs, removed Tang's sunglasses, and said, "Settle down here and don't make any noise." Tang saw that the room was simply furnished. Apart from a table, a chair, and a bed, there was nothing else. The two female bandits looked like "Shanghainese girlfriends." Although they looked like female heroes, after the four male bandits talked to the two female bandits about the kidnapping, they left.</p>
<p>Negotiating the Ransom in Pudong The hostage Tang was watched by the two female bandits and spent his days washing his face with tears. He could not reason with these "gangster girlfriends." Two days later, the bandits came and said, "We negotiated the ransom in Pudong today. The other party has no money to pay. This incident is really tricky." They shook their heads and left. The next day, one bandit came again and said, "It is best to take the hostage with us." So they took Tang Zairu to the Bund in a car and transferred him to a prepared small boat.</p>
<p>Buying Off the Guards in a Small Boat After the bandits transferred Tang to a small boat, they crossed to the opposite bank. After arriving in Pudong, the bandits went ashore that night. When they came back, they said that there was no news. The next day, they went ashore again. However, the hostage Tang Zairu only had three people guarding him after the bandits went ashore. He wanted to use money to sway their evil thoughts, so he said, "If you can get me out of this danger, I will reward you handsomely. Five hundred yuan for each of you." The guarding bandits immediately agreed.</p>
<p>Tang Zairu Escapes The Bandits Tang Zairu bribed the guarding bandits and immediately asked them to return to Shanghai. He promised to pay them tomorrow. The bandits, trusting his honesty and reliability, boldly crossed the river. After arriving at the Bund, it was already the evening of the 27th. Tang returned to his residence. The next day (28th), the so-called guarding bandits went to Tang's office to collect the money. Tang paid them 500, 600, and 700 yuan each, which they carried away triumphantly.</p>
<p>Bandits Apprehended in a Hotel Zhou A Da, one of the three guards, was also from Pudong. After obtaining the money out of thin air, he bought clothes and expressed his wealth. On the evening of the day before yesterday, at 11:00 PM, he checked into room 26 of the Songjiang Hotel in Juxing Lane, Shilu intersection, Simalu. The Detective Sergeant of the Dishiwei Road Police Station learned of the matter and secretly went there yesterday morning and arrested Zhou. He is scheduled to be sent to the Special Zone Court this morning.</p>
<h3>Desperate Tears Before Bandit Execution</h3>
<p>Tragic Words Before Execution</p>
<p>A Barefoot Man with a Chivalrous Spirit</p>
<p>Too Late for Regret After a Moment of Foolishness</p>
<p>Liu Arong from Haimen, 40 years old, on January 14th of last year at 9:15 AM, gathered a gang and kidnapped Zhou Zongzhi from No. 567 Dagu Road with the intention of demanding a ransom. After the incident, Ma Zonglai, a Chinese detective from the Xinzha Police Station, arrested Liu and brought him before the Provisional Court, where he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Liu appealed, but the appeal was rejected. Upon review by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, there were still doubts about Liu's sentence, so the case was sent back to the Appeals Court for further review. Liu's sentence was changed to death, which was approved by the Provincial Government and ordered to be carried out. Yesterday at 2 PM, the police escorted Liu Arong to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District District Court. Judge Cheng Shangfeng presided over the court and said to Liu, "Today we are ordered to carry out the execution. Do you have anything to say?" Liu replied that he lived at No. 64, Rende Lane, Yueke Road, and had a wife and daughter. He had nothing else to say, only that he requested two hundred cash for sorghum wine and to be allowed to speak briefly with his wife so that she could arrange for the collection of his body. Liu's wife also brought their daughter to the court, claiming that she wanted to collect the body but did not know the location and requested to be informed. The court granted her request. Liu then told his wife, "After I am executed, you can go to the Pingjiang Public Office to buy a coffin and collect my body, because the coffin prices there are cheaper." Judge Cheng then ordered him to be sent to the District Court for execution. Liu was then taken away by Chinese and Western police officers, along with his photo and case file, and put into a prisoner vehicle. They drove to the Caoxi North Road execution grounds. The District Court appointed Prosecutor Xu Heling as the supervising officer. He ordered Police Chief Yang Deshan, Police Officer Chen Xihui, and execution police officers Gu Hanqing, Yin Daoxu, Zhou Qiwen, and Zhang Peilin to go to the execution grounds and bring Liu Arong forward. Liu stated that he was 42 years old, from Haimen, and lived on Buck Road. "My wife is currently at the Baolong Hospital and will come to collect my body tomorrow. Although I am a barefoot man, I have a chivalrous spirit and often take the blame for others, paying money for others without concern. Who would have thought I would end up like this? But it was my own foolishness and being deceived by others. It is too late for regret." After speaking, he sadly shed tears and sighed incessantly. There is a saying that "a dying man's words are good." The judge ordered the execution to proceed. Police Chief Yang directed the execution police to take him away for execution. The body was collected by the hall for burial.</p>

<p>Firm Denial of Involvement in Kidnapping</p>
<p>Xie and His Wife and Young Son All in Court</p>
<p>Xie Baosheng's young son, Songtao, who lived at No. 817 1/2 Buck Road, was kidnapped by robbers who broke into his home on the evening of the 22nd of last month. He was taken to a small boat in the river in Qibao Town. Peng Yuansheng, a fellow Jiangbei native of Xie's wife, Li, suddenly went to Xie's house, volunteering to negotiate the ransom with the bandits. Due to revealing loopholes, the police arrested Peng and went to Qibao to rescue Xie's child. They also arrested Yang Dengge, Yang Xuesheng, Zhang Wansheng, Feng Yuanxue, Li Ganquan, Li Yousan, Li Ren, Zhou Wangshi, and Li Yangshi, both men and women, and brought them before the Special District District Court for interrogation. Details were reported previously. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi opened the court for further trial. According to the police lawyer, Yang Xuesheng, Zhang Wansheng, and Li Ganquan were found to be unrelated, and the police withdrew the charges. The court granted the request, and the three were released first. Xie Baosheng was then called to testify. He stated that six bandits came that evening, two with handguns and two with Mauser pistols. They first robbed valuables and then kidnapped his son. On the 30th of last month, Peng suddenly came to his house to inquire about the robbery and the loss of his son. His family told him, and Peng promised to help investigate. He came again the next day, saying that he had found out that it was done by Jiangbei natives with the surnames Liu and Yu, etc. The bandits were in Changzhou, and he needed to contact them, so he was given six yuan and went on April 1st. He returned on the 5th. When asked about the process, his answers were incoherent, and the letter he sent on the 4th was especially suspicious. When detectives came to investigate, they took Peng away and then went to Qibao together, rescuing his son from Li Yousan's boat and arresting the other defendants. Xie's wife, Li, also testified that the stolen items were gold bracelets, necklaces, and gold rings. Judge Wu then interrogated the defendant Peng Yuansheng, whose testimony was evasive. Yang Dengge testified that Peng ordered him to hire Li Yousan's boat, saying that he was returning to Jiangbei. He did not know that it was for kidnapping. Li Yousan testified that Li Ren was his son, who worked as a rickshaw puller in Shanghai and was now planning to return to Jiangbei, so he and his daughter-in-law, Li Yangshi, were both on the boat. On the 22nd of last month, Yang came to hire the boat, saying that Peng was taking his family back to Yancheng, with an agreed boat fare of eleven yuan, and arranged to board the boat on the afternoon of the 23rd. Waiting until night, five or six people boarded the boat with a child. When he saw that the child did not look like Peng's family, he questioned them. They said that he was a relative of Peng. Peng also came later. He did not want to transport them, but they initially wanted to use force. Later, they said that the child would stay temporarily for three days, and they would find a boat to move him. On the 25th and 26th, people came to the boat, telling them not to make a sound. They kept saying they would change boats, but they never did. They also brought an old woman, Zhou Wangshi, to the boat, saying that she was there to take care of the child. On the 7th of this month, they came again and said that the boat had been found and would be moved on the 8th or 9th. Unexpectedly, they were arrested that night. His family of three generations (because his daughter-in-law's child was also being raised by her in prison) are now all detained. If it is confirmed that he is involved in the kidnapping case, he is willing to accept the most severe punishment. Xie's son, Songtao, was brought to court by his parents. Songtao identified Li Yousan, Li Ren, father and son, Li Ren's wife, Li Yangshi, and the old woman, Zhou Wangshi, as those who were guarding him on the boat. After arguments from both lawyers, Judge Wu announced that a date would be set for sentencing. Peng Yuansheng and the other seven men and women were all detained separately.</p>
<h3>Liu Siqiao Dies Tragically, Wife Grief-Stricken and Ill</h3>
<p>Failed to Appear in Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Both Parties Agreed to Adjourn for Further Hearing</p>
<p>Liu's Monthly Income Was 500 Yuan</p>
<p>Calculated Based on 20 Years of Service</p>
<p>Therefore, 200,000 Yuan Should Be Compensated</p>
<p>Concern for the Livelihood of Elderly Mother and Young Children</p>
<p>Liu Siqiao from Zhenhai, practiced medicine in Shanghai, hanging his shingle in Ping Le Lane, Second East Road. He had entrusted the Huafeng Printing House on Lincoln Road to print his translated book, "Huang Han Medical Science". On the morning of the 7th of this month, Liu went to the printing house to proofread the manuscript. After finishing, he took a rickshaw home. While passing through Great West Road, he was hit and killed by a car driven by Pan Shiju, a Cantonese man. His wife, Liu Li, hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to accuse Pan Shiju of intentional homicide in the Special District District Court, requesting his arrest and punishment under Article 285 of the criminal law, and filed a civil suit for damages. The reasons were that Liu's average monthly business income during his lifetime was around 500 yuan. Liu was 33 years old, and based on the calculation that he could still serve for 20 years, even if his business income did not increase in the future, and the income from his usual writings was not included in the regular income, the actual loss to his family was at least 120,000 yuan. The plaintiff had an elderly mother, young wife, and six children, the eldest son being only ten years old, and the youngest daughter being only five months old. In the future, their education, marriage, and upbringing would all require money. The defendant lived a life of luxury and did not know the suffering of others who relied on their monthly hard-earned income for survival. The deceased was gone, but what was the crime of the living? It was impossible to let them freeze and starve to death one after another. She earnestly requested that the full amount be paid in compensation to secure their livelihood. This case was scheduled to be heard yesterday afternoon, but the plaintiff, Liu Li, was devastated by the sudden death of her husband, grieving excessively and crying all day, leading to illness and inability to appear in court. When Judge Wu Tingqi opened the court, her lawyer, Jiang Yiping, stated that the plaintiff could not attend court due to illness and requested a postponement. The defendant's defense lawyer also agreed, so Judge Wu approved the adjournment to be heard on the afternoon of May 10th.</p>
<h3>Arm Amputated Worker Not Saved Due to Late Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>Could Have Been Saved If Sent to Hospital Immediately</p>
<p>Accountant's Responsibility Difficult to Deny</p>
<p>Sentenced to a Fine of 500 Yuan</p>
<p>Lin Afang, an 18-year-old worker at the Tongyi Silk Weaving Factory at No. 85 Hed Road in West Shanghai, was careless during work at 10:30 PM on the 24th of this month. His arm was caught in the belt of the machine, and his arm was instantly severed and bleeding profusely. Other workers stopped the machine and reported to Xu Qingtang, the factory accountant from Hangzhou, who sent Lin to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, due to excessive blood loss and severe injuries, he died. The police took the body to the morgue for examination and reported it to the authorities. After confirming the cause of death, they ordered a coffin and burial. Yesterday, Xu was brought to the Special District District Court, where Judge Wu interrogated him. According to the police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, Lin was injured by the machine at 10:20 PM, but was not sent to the hospital until 11:00 PM. According to the doctor, if he had been sent to the hospital immediately after the injury was discovered, he might have been saved. However, due to the delay and excessive blood loss, he could not be saved. The defendant could not escape responsibility, so he was charged under Article 291 of the criminal law. Dai Jincheng and Zhu Chaoyou testified about the circumstances at the time. Xu confessed that he was extremely shocked when he learned that Lin had been injured and hired a car to send him to the hospital, but it was indeed slightly delayed. Judge Wu verified the confession and sentenced Xu Qingtang to a fine of 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wife Pregnant and Giving Birth After Husband's Three-Year Absence</h3>
<p>Lu Knew She Was in the Wrong</p>
<p>Divorced Her Husband</p>
<p>Chen Achao, a local from the Lu Family Residence in Yangjing Town, Pudong, worked at the China Electric Company in Xiamen and was rarely at home. His wife, Lu, was beautiful and did not like to sleep alone. She had an affair with Tang Xianchen, who ran the Detai Cotton Shop in the Shenxiang Pavilion area inside the New North Gate of the city. They had been secretly meeting for some time. Her husband had not returned for three years, and she became pregnant. Last year, Chen's mother found out and reported it to the police station, who arrested the adulterous couple (Tang Xianchen and Chen Lu) and brought them before the District Court. The pair of illicit lovers were sentenced to imprisonment. Now, Chen Achao, because his wife had committed adultery, meeting the legal conditions for divorce, hired lawyer Xu Shichang to file a petition in the District Court for divorce. His petition stated that he had married Lu in October of the eleventh year of the Republic of China, and they were initially on good terms. However, because the plaintiff traveled around for work and was rarely at home, the defendant's adulterous nature grew, and she could not bear to live alone. She often used the excuse of returning to Ningbo, but in reality, she was fulfilling her wishes in the mulberry field. Scandal spread everywhere. Last year, the plaintiff's mother secretly found out that the defendant was having an affair with Tang Xianchen, living together as husband and wife. She reported it to the Second District First Precinct police station, who arrested the couple. At that time, the plaintiff had been away for three years, and the defendant was heavily pregnant. She was later sentenced to imprisonment by the court. Due to the defendant's pregnancy, her mother's family posted bail for her to give birth during her sentence. She gave birth to a boy and is still living with her adulterous lover Tang, and has not returned home. Such unchaste and adulterous behavior has broken all ties of affection and violates the seven grounds for divorce. Legally and morally, it constitutes sufficient grounds for divorce. Therefore, he petitioned for a divorce. The defendant knew she was in the wrong and had nothing to say. As a result, they reached a settlement in court, and the defendant was willing to divorce. The settlement was reached, signed, and they left the court.</p>
<h3>Actively Progressing Cycling Competition</h3>
<p>Shanghai is a major commercial port in the East with a population of three million. However, there are few open-air entertainment venues that are hygienic, beneficial to the body and mind, and have pure intentions without gambling. The Weile Garden Cycling Competition is organized to meet this need. This type of competition is popular in Paris and is exciting and prohibits gambling. The upper class all flock to it. For the price of a ticket, both the body and mind can receive pleasure. There is no greater leisure activity. Weile Garden is located next to the Riding School on Haig Road in West Shanghai (opposite Fudan Middle School), covering an area of 25 acres. The track and grandstand are currently under construction. The area is large and the air is fresh. The grandstand is divided into two sides, each of which can accommodate 3,500 people. There are also 1,000 seats on each of the four corners. In addition, there are 2,000 box seats inside the track, totaling 10,000 spectators. The seats are spacious and clean. If necessary, 5,000 more seats can be added, accommodating 15,000 people. The track was designed by the famous architect Labaude, modeled after the Paris style. It is 250 meters long and 7 meters wide, with a 45-degree angle turn. The floor is 2 inches thick and extremely sturdy. When the project is completed, even foreign racers will not be able to tell that this track was built in the East. The venue has a variety of bars to meet the needs of Chinese and foreign guests. It is expected to be completed in mid-June, and the opening is scheduled for early July. At that time, Chinese and Western athletes will race and chase, and electric lights will illuminate the track. A grand occasion can be expected. Compared to gambling competitions with commissions, its value is not the same.</p>
<h3>Dance Hall Counterfeit Money Case</h3>
<p>Tried Yesterday by the Special District Court</p>
<p>Wu Yingyi Proved Not to be an American</p>
<p>Counterfeit Bills Must be Sent to Hong Kong for Examination</p>
<p>Difficult to Distinguish Truth from Falsehood in Shanghai</p>
<p>Because counterfeit 100-yuan banknotes of the bank have been found in the market recently, the McCally Bank specially reported the case to the police for investigation. Until recently, the Western detective Gaisili and Chinese detective Wang Yingjie of the Old Gate Police Station found Wu Yingyi, a Cantonese man who was using the fake banknotes, in the Anle Palace dance hall. Then, Chen Lili, a Cantonese dance girl from the New Dance Hall who was hiding two 100-yuan fake banknotes for Wu, was arrested. Wu initially claimed to be American, but the US consulate proved that he was not an American citizen. The police then transferred him to the Special District District Court, ordered Chen to be released on bail, and detained Wu for further investigation. According to the Chinese and Western detectives handling the case, Wu also used a 100-yuan fake banknote at the Commercial Dance Hall on North Sichuan Road near the Yokohama Bridge on April 26. The police previously placed Wu and three other men in Western suits together and ordered the dance hall staff to identify them at the police station. They immediately identified Wu as the one who used the fake banknote. A silk shop at No. 261 Nanjing Road also received two similar fake banknotes a week ago, but the shop could not determine whether Wu used them due to the large number of customers every day. Yesterday morning, the police summoned Tang Siwuers, the American deputy accountant of McCally Bank, and brought Wu and Chen Lili to court. Judge Xu Jia interrogated them. The police lawyer stated the results of the investigation. The deputy accountant of the bank then said that the seized banknotes could not yet be determined to be counterfeit and had to be sent to the Hong Kong headquarters for examination to determine their authenticity. However, the signature on the submitted banknotes was slightly different from the real banknotes, the numbers were not neat, and the color was slightly darker than the real banknotes. Other than that, it was not easy to distinguish. Xu Shiqing, the owner of the Commercial Dance Hall, and Chen Yulu, a Western servant, testified that Wu arrived at the hall at 1:15 am and left at 2 am on the night of April 26, and gave a 100-yuan banknote from McCally Bank, which he used for change. Wu confessed that he was at the New New Dance Hall that night and could ask Chen Lili. However, Chen stated that Wu came to the New New Dance Hall for two nights, but she did not remember the dates. Judge Xu then ordered the defendants to be returned to custody or released on bail separately and adjourned the hearing for fourteen days. The police fear that there are still many of these counterfeit banknotes circulating in the market and hope that merchants who have received such banknotes will report them to the Old Gate Police Station and provide accurate information so that the cases can be handled together.</p>

The latest sanitary equipment and perfect educational and vocational courses will be implemented to achieve a model.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Wants Lover, Not Father</h3>
<p>Feng Jinlin's Daughter is Like This</p>
<p>Feng Caidi is Too Indulgent in Love</p>
<p>Feng Jinlin, a native of Dongtai living in Yangsi Bridge, Pudong, is sixty-two years old and supports himself by peddling. He has a daughter named Caidi, who is now eighteen and still quite attractive. Because Feng is poor, he always takes his daughter with him when he goes out, or lets her sell flowers exclusively. In the morning, she takes a basket and goes to various docks to sell, hoping to make some small profits. Shi Zhenhe, a native of Zhejiang, is a foreman at the dock. He met the woman from time to time and, seeing her beauty, took the opportunity to seduce her. Over time, the two developed a deep love and fell in love. However, the woman was embarrassed by her father's presence and could not meet him often. Therefore, on March 7th of this year, the woman secretly ran away and lived with Shi. They lived together at No. 3 Qunben Lane, the old site of the Shanghai Army Camp in the South City, as if they were a couple. After the woman disappeared, Feng searched everywhere but could not find her. Until the day before yesterday, Feng happened to meet his beloved daughter near the Shanghai Army Camp. He ordered her to return home, but she refused, even crying loudly. Onlookers were numerous. Zhao Shuyan, the guard of the 23rd post, heard about it and came to investigate. After learning the details, he brought her to the First Precinct, where the director interrogated her. The woman confessed that her biological father, Feng Jinlin, was very violent. When she was at home, she would be beaten and abused if she displeased him. Unable to bear the suffering, she had no choice but to run away secretly. However, she was a single woman with nowhere to live. Out of desperation, she had engaged in illicit relations with Shi. Although she had been found by her biological father, the suffering she had endured was difficult to describe in words. Therefore, she would rather die than return home. She requested to be informed. The director, considering that the matter concerned a woman running away, immediately prepared a document and sent it to the Shanghai District Court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Mad Young Woman</h3>
<p>Claims to be Named Wu Jiesheng</p>
<p>Yesterday (29th) morning at 10 AM, a fashionable young woman, about twenty years old, with short hair and a cheongsam, wearing dancing stockings and high-heeled patent leather shoes, dressed like a female student, with a cigarette in her mouth and glasses on her nose, walked out of the North Railway Station. She passed through North Zhejiang Road and reached Xinmin Road, then turned into Datong Road, laughing and scolding along the way. Sometimes she sang loudly, sometimes she laughed wildly at the sky, as if she were suffering from a mental illness and had been severely stimulated. As a result, passers-by followed her. More and more people gathered along the way, totaling hundreds of people. Some well-meaning people asked about her origin. The woman replied that she was from Shandong, but her accent sounded like Hangzhou. When asked what she was doing in Shanghai, she replied that she was looking for her beloved husband. Later, when she reached Xinjiang Road, the guard, seeing the crowd following her and not dispersing, fearing it would cause trouble, took the woman to the First Precinct of the Fourth District. After Director Yao interrogated her, she confessed that her surname was Wu, her name was Jiesheng, and she was twenty-one years old, from Shandong. Because her husband had a dispute with his family after their wedding, he secretly went out and followed Ban Chao's example of abandoning his pen to join the army. Therefore, she also abandoned her parents and came to Shanghai to find her husband, hoping to reunite. When asked for her husband's name, she did not answer the question and spoke incoherently. She was considered insane and was sent to a charitable organization to be temporarily cared for, waiting for her family to claim her.</p>
<h3>Unsuccessful Marriage Proposal, Where Did the Anonymous Letter Come From?</h3>
<p>A Boring Anecdote of Shi Acai</p>
<p>Cao Binghua, a native of Ningbo, is forty-one years old and lives behind Changqing Pond in the Lu Family Residence in Pudong. He used to be a worker at the British-American Tobacco Factory. Cao has a daughter named Lanying, who is eighteen years old and quite beautiful. She was promised to someone but has not yet married. Recently, a fellow villager, Shi Acai (twenty-four years old, living at No. 4 Fushun Lane, Chunjiang Road, Pudong, also a worker at the British-American Tobacco Factory), coveted Lanying's beauty and asked Cao for marriage through an intermediary but was disappointed. Cao's family received an anonymous letter the day before yesterday, which stated: "I have spent a lot of money for the marriage proposal. You should have received the previous letter. I have not yet received a reply. I do not know what it means. This letter is the final mobilization order. Do not underestimate it." After receiving the letter, Cao, believing that Shi had damaged his daughter Lanying's reputation, on the morning of yesterday, accompanied by his relatives Xu Dade and Xu Dachuan, brothers, twisted Shi and handed him over to the police of the Fourth Platoon, who transferred him to the Third District. Shi Acai confessed that he was twenty-four years old, from Dinghai. A tenant of Lanying's grandmother, A Gen's wife, had said that she would act as a matchmaker, but the Cao family asked for a bride price of 300 yuan, so he gave up. He did not send a letter to the Cao family or damage Lanying's reputation. The district chief considered that the matter concerned marital disputes and was complicated and ordered that 1,000 people be sent to the District Court for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Widow Was Actually a Runaway Wife</h3>
<p>Matchmaker Jointly Responsible</p>
<p>Ge Chengxiang, a native of Ningbo who rents at No. 84 Wufu Lane, Lu Family Residence, Pudong, is over thirty years old and has not yet married. He entrusted someone to find a wife everywhere. Two fellow villagers, old women Wang Yuanshi and Wang Guifang, said that there was a widow, Xu Chen, who was thirty-four years old and of good character, who was willing to remarry. Ge was very satisfied when he saw Chen and agreed on a dowry of 70 yuan and a matchmaker fee of 14 yuan each. A marriage certificate was drawn up and the money was exchanged. This happened a week ago. However, the night before last, Mao Fanglie, a native of Tongzhou, came to recognize Xu Chen as his runaway wife. He reported it to the police of the Fourth Platoon, who brought Chen, Ge Chengxiang, and the matchmakers Wang Yuanshi and Wang Guifang together to the Third District. After the district chief inquired about the details, he considered that Ge had bought a married woman and deserved his punishment. Wang and Wang were also not good people for acting as matchmakers for profit. They were all sent to the District Court for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Labor Road Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Location: Ferry Crossing</p>
<p>Loss: Six Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday (29th) morning at approximately 11:45 AM, Lu Linbiao, an accountant from the Yongyu Cotton Mill in western Shanghai, along with two others, were transporting a large sum of cash, six thousand yuan in silver, when they reached the ferry crossing within the alleyway next to the Baocheng (now Xihé) Cotton Mill on Labor Road. Suddenly, seven robbers appeared and completely seized the cash, then fled. The detailed account is recorded below:</p>
<p>Mill Situation: The Yongyu Cotton Mill is located at Guangfu Road, north of the Xiaoshadu Suzhou Creek in western Shanghai. The owner, Lu Zaiduan, is around 40 years old and from Yongkang, Zhejiang. The mill has been operating for nearly three years and has over six thousand spindles, with business reportedly thriving. A wholesale outlet is located at No. 22 Jiqing Lane, Sanyangjing Bridge in the Public Concession. Lu Linbiao, the head silver and cash accountant of the mill (and the owner's cousin, employed for almost three years and known for his diligence and trustworthiness, which is why the owner trusts him), is 24 years old and from Yongkang. Wu Boying, the wholesale outlet accountant, is 30 years old, a local, and also known for his honesty.</p>
<p>Reason for Sending the Money: According to the mill's established practice, the salaries of all employees and workers are paid on the 1st and 15th of each month. One or two days before the payday, the wholesale outlet sends a large sum of cash to the mill for distribution, which has always been the case. As the May 1st payday was approaching, Lu Linbiao, the head accountant, personally carried 5,400 yuan in ten-yuan and five-yuan notes wrapped in newspaper. He was accompanied by Wu Boying, the wholesale outlet accountant, who held 100 yuan in silver, and Huang Fengfang, a trainee at the mill, who carried a package of 500 yuan in small denomination notes, totaling six thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Details of the Robbery: Lu, Wu, and others, carrying the large sum of money, hired a No. 17723 covered automobile from the Aido Road Yuegong Automobile Company for the sake of caution. The three of them, along with the money, sat in the car, heading west. Upon reaching the alleyway next to the Xihé Cotton Mill on Labor Road, near the Suzhou Creek ferry crossing, the car stopped. Lu and the others got out of the car, signed the bill, and paid the driver six jiao in silver. As Lu and the others were walking towards the ferry crossing, seven robbers suddenly appeared. They were wearing black and gray long robes and copper basin hats. Four robbers each held pistols, openly charging forward, grabbing Lu and the others by their collars, and warning them not to make a sound. The remaining robbers then seized the money and fled towards Labor Road. One robber stood at the ferry crossing, forcing Lu and the others to board the ferry. As the ferry departed from the shore, the robber fled east. Lu and the others were all trembling and dared not make a sound, only being able to cross the river and return to the mill.</p>
<p>Report After the Incident: After Lu and the others arrived at the mill, they reported the robbery to the owner, who immediately reported the incident to the Sixth District Police Station via telephone. Upon receiving the report, Section Chief Duan immediately led Officer Wang Liu Zai and Detective Team Leader Liu Shaoqing, along with various detectives, to the scene of the incident. However, the robbers had already fled far away, leaving no trace. They thoroughly inspected the scene and brought Lu, Wu, and Huang back to the station for separate questioning. They awaited the arrival of the Yuegong Company driver for questioning and verification. Subsequently, Section Chief Duan ordered the detective team members and all the senior police officers in the district to swiftly apprehend the stolen goods and robbers.</p>
<h3>Another Accomplice Apprehended in the Pudong Cloth Robbery Case</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 8th of this month, the Xinshengchang, Yongfeng, Liyishun, and Heng three customs brokerage firms hired Fan Xiaohai's barge to transport foreign cloth to the Lianxing steamer at the Longmaozhan Wharf in Pudong, hoping to load it onto the ship to be transported to other ports. Unexpectedly, when the barge reached the mouth of the Suzhou Creek in Pudong, it was suddenly approached by eight robbers on a boat, who brandished pistols, intimidated them, and robbed nine cases of foreign cloth worth six thousand yuan in silver. After the incident, the firms reported the case to the police for investigation. The water patrol police, including Detective Sun Agui, apprehended two of the robbers, Ji Chunbao and Fan Jinbao, as well as three individuals who received the stolen goods: Wan Zhongliang, Xu Bingquan, and Gu Peiqing, and recovered a portion of the stolen goods, who were handed over to the Special District Local Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday at noon, the detectives handling the case apprehended another robber, Yuan Xiaoqing (also known as Shandong Laosan), a native of Xuzhou, at the corner of Peng Road and Broadway Road. He was detained at the Hongkou Police Station. After being questioned by the police chief, and identified by the apprehended Fan Jinbao as an accomplice without a doubt, the police chief ordered him to be detained, pending investigation and combined prosecution in court.</p>
<h3>Where Did the Guns and Ammunition Come From?</h3>
<p>No One Admits Ownership</p>
<p>Previously, Chief Chinese Detective Zhu Hanbo, Detective Bao Zhou Kaiwen, Liu Decheng, and others from the Harbin Police Station, apprehended fourteen robbers, including Zhou Yiwen, Wang Dasizi, and Dai Wencheng, both male and female, at No. 92 Harbin Road and No. 1354 Dongjiaxing Road, and confiscated one pistol and 197 rounds of ammunition. They were handed over to the Special District Court for interrogation and separate detention. Later, Wang Dasizi confessed that the confiscated guns and ammunition were purchased for 45 yuan from Zhang Yongxiang, a Tianjin native at No. 2424 Xinjihang Road. The detectives then detained Zhang for questioning. According to Zhang, the guns and ammunition were not his own but were purchased for 42 yuan from Luo Shushi, a Henan woman at No. 2091 Tangshan Road. Chinese and Western detectives then went to detain Luo Shushi. According to Luo Shushi, she did not know Zhang Yongxiang, and her family did not sell such guns and ammunition. As to whether her son had any contact with him, she was unaware. The police chief ordered them to be detained separately pending a combined trial.</p>
<h3>Annamese Man Killed by Car</h3>
<p>Guan Tingzuo, a driver for the Chinese Postal Service, was driving a truck on the evening of the 1st of this month and drove to the route of the French Concession. At that time, a certain Mr. A, an Annamese man, was riding a bicycle, unable to avoid him in time, resulting in him being knocked down and fatally injured. After the police station handed over Guan to the French court, he was instructed to await further investigation. Yesterday, another interrogation was conducted. The defendant, represented by lawyer T. Baker, argued that the deceased's bicycle was not lit on the night in question, making it difficult for the defendant to identify in the dark road, causing the accident. It was the deceased's own carelessness, requesting clarification. The Chinese and Western officials ordered him to withdraw and await judgment.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Stealing Money and Fleeing Apprehended</h3>
<p>Cao Axiao, an apprentice at the Huasheng Fish Store on Waiguizi Road, Wusong, stole a large sum of money from the store's silver box before dawn the other morning and fled. It is now known that when the apprentice ran away with the money, in addition to more than 400 yuan in banknotes, there were also more than 600 yuan in silver. Feeling that he was carrying too much weight, he felt quite inconvenienced when walking. He immediately took the money to the Hongyu Money Shop on Tongtai Road in the town and exchanged the silver for banknotes as a number. The shop asked what the money was used for at this time, when each company was not yet active. Axiao falsely claimed that the fishing boat had guests, and the current silver was inconvenient to carry, and they had to set sail urgently in the early tide, so the shopkeeper asked him to come to exchange. The shop did not suspect him, so they exchanged the amount. Axiao then carried the money and fled to Luodian. At this time, the sky was already late. He lingered on the street for a long time before staying at a certain inn. Then, a carpenter saw that Axiao was still young, what was the matter here at night, so he did not move his voice and secretly observed the matter. He saw Axiao take out hundreds of banknotes from his side, put them on the table, count the numbers, and laugh very proudly. The carpenter was very suspicious of this situation, thinking that there must be a reason in it. He immediately secretly reported to the Public Security Bureau, which sent the police to inquire and saw more than three hundred yuan in banknotes on the table. The carpenter immediately asked where it came from. Axiao falsely answered that the shopkeeper told him to come here to collect the bill. Because it was too late, he borrowed here for one night. Then he answered that he wanted to go to a certain elementary school in Jiading to study. The police officer's answers did not match the previous and subsequent words. When he searched Axiao's side, he copied out 700 yuan of banknotes in his pocket. Axiao knew that he could not be defended at this point, so he confessed the truth, and then took him to the Luodian Public Security Bureau for temporary detention. On the one hand, he prepared a letter to send the police to notify the Wusong Huasheng Fish Store.</p>

Before he could defend himself, he was washed into the river. The boatman saw it and immediately used a bamboo pole to salvage him, but the tide was very rapid. After salvaging for a long time, he has not yet been salvaged. The store learned about it and immediately reported to the Rescue Bureau, asking them to send patrol ships to search for Xie's body.

<h3>The Meiya Factory Workers Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>Unresolved Matters Await the Municipal Party Department to Handle</p>
<p>The workers of the Meiya Silk Weaving General Factory and its branches had a dispute over requests for improved treatment and were forced to strike. After more than ten days, the Municipal Party Department and the Preparatory Committee of the General Labor Union failed to resolve it. As the May Revolution Memorial Day was approaching, they were deeply afraid that reactionary elements would take the opportunity to instigate and cause a huge disturbance. A part of the workers went astray, so Comrades Wu Jiaze and Qin Boyan have been persuading them to go to each factory for days. A representative meeting was convened at the Preparatory Committee of the General Labor Union yesterday. All parties agreed to obey on the resumption of work first. All unresolved matters are willing to wait quietly for the Municipal Party Department to be responsible for handling them. Then, at 2:00 PM that afternoon, Comrades Wu, Qin, Gao, and Long led the workers to resume work in each factory. Regarding the section that the worker representatives must not be expelled, it is heard that the representatives of the Party Department and the Preparatory Committee of the General Labor Union also contacted the General Manager of the factory, Wei Jiahui, once. The factory director also expressed his compliance.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Addition Negotiation Questioned</h3>
<p>And Wait for the Specialized Committee to Discuss</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Workers Union Rises Up to Oppose</p>
<p>Chen Shiguang, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai, followed the instructions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ordering him to request the British Public Works Bureau to add 5,161 rickshaw licenses according to the request of rickshaw dealers Zheng Limin and others, in order to relieve the livelihood of unemployed rickshaw pullers, and attached six photos of rickshaw pullers fighting for cars. The editorial director of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Yin Bingxin, came to the office and stated that the British Public Works Bureau reduced the rickshaw licenses to 10,000 in 1924, stipulating a five-year limit, which has now expired and can be added. He requested serious negotiations with the Public Works Bureau. Director Chen exchanged views with Mr. Edwards, the General Manager of the British Public Works Bureau, informally. According to Mr. Edwards, when the rickshaw licenses were reduced by 5,161 in 1924, there was no five-year limit. Now the traffic is congested, and even the existing 10,000 vehicles often have empty cars in groups on the road, competing for passengers, and fights are prone to occur. This issue will be discussed by the specialized committee of the Public Works Bureau before a reply is given. It is heard that Director Chen has already reported the process to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for verification and instructions.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Rickshaw Pullers and Rickshaw Workers Union recently read in the newspaper that someone had petitioned the authorities to negotiate with the British Public Works Bureau to open 5,161 rickshaw licenses, which is related to the livelihood of rickshaw pullers and has a huge impact. They held a reorganization meeting in the 19th branch of the Second District Party Department and opposed Zheng Limin and others' request to add rickshaw licenses. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai received a document from the Rickshaw Workers Union yesterday, the meaning of which is: (1) There are often empty cars on the road with 10,000 vehicles on the road. Because there are electric trams and public buses all over the concession, the existing vehicles are already worried about their livelihood. If more vehicles are added, it will affect their livelihood. (2) Not all of the 100,000 unemployed workers can pull rickshaws. Pulling rickshaws requires familiarity with road regulations to ensure passenger safety. If they are laymen, the lives of passengers are in danger. (3) Why does the Public Works Bureau not like to add rickshaw licenses? With 5,161 more vehicles, there will be more income. The reason for not agreeing to add more is also that they know that business is slack now and there is no need to add more. This is the above-mentioned requirements for refuting Zheng Limin's request.</p>
<h3>Church Income Bandits in Anhui-Hubei Border Area</h3>
<p>Two Priests Kidnapped</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that yesterday (28th), the leader of the Catholic Church in the Jiangnan District of this port received a telegram that four counties in the border area of Hubei and Anhui were looted by bandits, and two Spanish church priests, Xidagu and Avidou, were kidnapped. After receiving the telegram, the church urgently telegraphed the National Government to find ways to rescue them. According to the Anhui telegram, these bandits are suspected of having communists among them. First, they robbed Susong, 35 miles away from the Hubei border, and destroyed the Catholic Church. Fortunately, the priest in the church heard the news and avoided it in advance, so he was spared. Then they robbed Taihu, northeast of Susong, and kidnapped a Catholic priest, but he was released because the government troops were chasing him very quickly. Then, Chun (transliteration) also reported looting. The Catholic priests in that place also heard the warning and avoided it in advance. Finally, Hezhou also heard of being robbed, and the two Spanish priests were kidnapped here.</p>
<h3>Completion of the Minsheng Canal in Qixian, Henan</h3>
<p>The Project Committee Sends a Letter of Thanks to the Jisheng Society</p>
<p>Irrigating More Than Four Thousand Qing of Fields</p>
<p>Discovering Ancient Wonders</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Jisheng Society received a letter from the Qixian Minsheng Canal Water Conservancy Project Committee in Henan, Lv Guoen, Li Jiesan, and others, saying, "To the great benefactors of the Shanghai Jisheng Society: Last year, we received a large loan from your society, so that hundreds of thousands of lives in Qixian were able to avoid death and were able to use this work to revitalize. The canal that has been unable to be dug for hundreds of years will be completed once the work is completed. The benefits of successive generations are all from your gifts. Now, on the day of the completion of the canal, we will report the project situation and irrigation benefits, send personnel to verify, to prove that the benefits are for the people. The canal opened by our county is named Qixian Minsheng Canal, in the northwest of Qixian City, which draws water from the Qi River. From Qingya to Sider River, the main canal is more than forty miles long, passing through mountains, crossing gullies, and using holes to pass water. The stones are bombed into a canal, in dozens of places, up to five main zhang deep and over a hundred zhang long. Other repairs to gates, weirs, and bridges, all engineering is extremely great. Since the start of construction in September last year, there have been no less than seven or eight hundred stone workers every day, and as many as tens of thousands of earth workers have been digging until now, and the project has been completed. It is now scheduled to release water in early April. It is estimated that the amount of water can irrigate about 4,000 acres. The size of the canal and the universality of the profits are the crown of the entire province of Henan. It is planned to open four branch canals, each over ten miles long, and is currently starting to dig. According to engineers, the cost of the main canal project will not be less than 300,000 yuan, calculated by labor. Now the statistics show that the cost is only about 80,000 yuan. Without the kindness of all the great benefactors, inspiring the conscience of the people and working enthusiastically, how could this be achieved. In addition to Mr. Dong Hengqu's personal presentation, we sincerely send a letter of thanks. Furthermore, during the excavation of the Minsheng Canal, on the night of April 7th, at work in Guowan, a object with a complete head and horns was unearthed. At the beginning of the discovery, there was a red light shining out of the cave. The workers all saw it. After careful examination of the excavated object, the head and face were square, and each was over a foot long and wide. The ears, eyes, mouth, nose, and bone shape were still there. The two horns were great and without argument, each three feet seven inches long, and the root circumference was one foot two inches. Exquisite and hollow, it is a rare treasure. Its color is white on the outside and green on the inside, all similar to stone. It seems that it was deposited here by ancient floods. I don't know whether it is a mountain beast or a water creature, and I don't know the details. It has research value. All great benefactors have broad knowledge and pay attention to antiquities. If you can come here and study and verify it in person, make the antiquities shine and increase the prosperity of Qiyi, it will be extremely happy and anticipated. The lack of water conservancy in our country has led to widespread floods and droughts. How can we have enthusiastic people in the country, such as the Fushun Silver Company organized by the Jisheng Society, thousands and hundreds of local and upright gentry, working together to make the best use of people and the best use of land, so that the increase in agricultural products can reduce floods and droughts. This is what is hoped for by those who are enthusiastic about saving the country.</p>

Also, Mr. Gao Henian and others telegraphed that the refugees who returned are short on the way, and they only have more than 20,000 yuan, which will inevitably lead to easy copper yuan to distribute. Please raise funds as much as possible, can you allocate more, please decide on the case. (3) Ling Runzhi, a representative of the Yancheng Red Cross, brought a letter to the meeting, requesting a large sum of relief funds to be sent for investigation and release.

<h3>A Smile from a Foreigner</h3>
<p>Sister: Brother, do you know why I married your brother-in-law? Because he was swimming when I was drowning and saved my life. That's why I repaid his kindness.</p>
<p>Brother: No wonder brother-in-law is complaining about everything, saying he'll never go swimming again.</p>

<h3>Jottings by the Lamp Chen Tianyi</h3>
<p>Rubber overshoes: A certain Mr. Dong, a friend, returned from Wuhu. I asked him about his observations along the way. Mr. Dong said, "People in your country have been intently trying to strengthen the nation lately, which is admirable. However, this time I went to Wuhu, traveling upstream, and although the scenery was still the same, the rice straw covering the roofs of the houses of ordinary people had mostly turned gray-black, not as clean and white as before with the annual replacement. From this, one can see the decline of the people's strength, which is far different from the past. At the entrance of one farmer's house, there were two pairs of rubber overshoes hanging high. The place is not far from Wuhu, and one can easily travel back and forth barefoot. Yet the farmers do not hesitate to spend more than two yuan to buy this product. Thus, the laziness of the people can be generally seen. Now, if we want to strengthen the country in this way, empty talk of reform is like climbing a tree to catch a fish." I agreed with his words and remained silent for a long time. Therefore, I record this to tell my fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>Foreigner: The foreigner is not a real foreigner. He is a miser from my hometown by the sea. He is slavishly frugal and owns hundreds of thousands of assets. He wears coarse clothing and goes barefoot, often traveling between fields and shops. Whatever he has left over, he buries in the ground. If a neighbor borrows from him, he must first agree to dig up his buried silver. Repayment must also be in silver coins. The miser is illiterate and does not allow his children and grandchildren to study. He does not even know how much property he owns. When he encountered a robbery and was tortured, he stubbornly refused to tell the truth and died at the hands of the robbers. His son, named Little Foreigner, is also very much like his father. He usually places a long ladder behind the house for escape during robberies. As for why the miser is called a foreigner, it is because he once had an affair with a village woman, and someone cut off his braid. This happened during the late Qing Dynasty, so he was often called a foreigner. His real name has been lost and is no longer known.</p>
<h3>Record of the Camellia in Southern Yunnan Qing</h3>
<p>Camellia, also known as Mandala, has evergreen leaves and does not wither in winter. It is similar to tea and is suitable for planting at the foot of mountains, so it is commonly called mountain tea. The color of the flowers is extremely diverse, not limited to red, and it blooms not only in spring but also in late winter. My Su's Humble Administrator's Garden was once famous for this flower, but now it has withered and no longer attracts attention. It can also be seen that the rise and fall of famous flowers are related to the times. Recently, my relative Mr. Dai returned from Yunnan and described the abundance of this flower in Yunnan. There are things worth recording, so I supplemented them with a pen.</p>
<p>Kunming City is originally a fertile area with lush plants, a beautiful and fertile land in the southwest. In recent years, with the progress of art, the gardens have been expanded, and the flowers and trees have become more brilliant. Camellia is especially a special product. The large trees can be several tens of feet high and two or three feet in diameter. Some flowers have as many as several thousand. Every time winter ends and spring comes, the color is as red as fire, no less than pomegranate flowers in May, bright and eye-catching. Its shape exceeds that of peony, and it is even more beautiful. According to legend, there are seventy-two kinds. Now it has increased to more than one hundred and thirty, which also shows the progress of planting. The flowers planted near the provincial capital are especially good. There are names such as Baozhu Agate Rouge, etc. The fairy flowers are graceful and beautiful. Therefore, Kunming City is famous as the city of flowers. Every spring, a group of flowers are exhibited. The city's products this year reached thirty thousand several thousand pots, which can be called a great spectacle. Former Mayor Ma Zhen once selected (Large Purple Robe), (Willow Leaf Silver Red), and (Nine Hearts Eighteen Petals) three kinds, and transported them to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum for planting. I don't know if they can bloom now.</p>
<p>Also, in the Taihua Temple in the West Mountain, there is a tree that is the oldest. It blooms every year. According to legend, it was planted by Emperor Jianwen of the Ming Dynasty and shines with the Tang plum and Song cypress of the Longquan Temple in the northeast outside the city.</p>
<h3>Fujian's Bird Remainder Tea is Abundant</h3>
<p>Wuyi Mountain in Fujian has extremely secluded scenery. Tea leaves are also produced in the mountains, which is extremely famous. Therefore, Wuyi tea and Huangshan tea are both praised by tea lovers.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of Wuyi tea, such as Sparrow Tongue, Zhulan, and Oolong. Among them, the most praised by tea lovers is Bird Remainder Tea. In southern Fujian, such as Zhangzhou and Xiamen, the style of sipping tea is particularly popular. Three or five dollars for a cup of tea is a common sight. According to tea lovers, the taste of Bird Remainder Tea is not comparable to other varieties. It is also said that the place of production of Bird Remainder Tea is most famous for the first peak of Wuyi. Otherwise, it must be counterfeit. Does the meaning of Bird Remainder Tea come from here? The first peak of Wuyi is high in the clouds, and tea trees grow between the cliffs. People want to pick them, but it is beyond human power. There is another kind of bird that likes to peck at the tea leaves on the cliffs. After the birds eat them, the locals pick them up and make them, hence the name. Its value is quite high, surpassing Huangshan Yunwu tea.</p>
<h3>Iron Field and School in Xiaonü Township, Hang County</h3>
<p>At the foot of Yinjia Mountain in Xiaonü Township, Hang County, there is a field, totaling eighteen acres. The field is surrounded by mountains, and the digging in the field is slightly deeper, and iron is exposed. This is true of the entire field, so it is called Iron Field. Narrators say that it is the foundation of an ancient king. Or it is said that there are treasures hidden below. There are various guesses. I don't know what is below. The name of Gu Tielian has been around for a long time and has spread far and wide. In the past, things were heard by Jiang Zishan, a naturalist from Hangyuan. The gentleman was driven by curiosity and went to the place to instigate the owner of the field to dig it out. Gu had already had this intention. He just didn't practice it because no one was helping to raise the money. This time, after Jiang's encouragement, he happily complied. When employing many workers, Jiang was brought to the field to dig. When digging, first dig away the top layer of floating mud. Unexpectedly, when digging to a depth of more than two feet, it was blocked by a hard object and could not be dug again. Seeing that it was indeed an iron grid, I used various methods. After six people worked day and night, they broke the iron grid and dug out a square foot of land. The iron can be three points thick. Below the iron is a fine, sticky, incense ash mud. The mud is about one foot thick, and under it is a stone egg. Remove the stone egg, it is a flat foot. Unexpectedly, under the foot of the bowl, there is another iron grid, which seems to be thicker than the upper layer, so there is no way to remove it. As a result, Jiang Gu's two people's energy was lost. And the sound spread, and people came to watch from all directions. The two were afraid that the local police station would hear the news and go to intervene, so they raked the mud flat and stopped working. But it has spread far and wide.</p>
<p>After this excavation of the above-mentioned Iron Field, although its true meaning was not known, the sight of this secret and strange trace is really amazing. It is recorded here on the right for the research of archaeologists at home and abroad.</p>
<h3>A Textual Research on the Original Meaning of the Naming of Doctors and Midwives Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Western doctors in China call themselves "doctors." According to the Zhou Rituals, the doctor is an official name, which is the same as the medical officer, which belongs to the Tian Guan and is the head of all doctors, who is in charge of medical administration. During the Five Dynasties, there was a Hanlin Medical Officer Envoy. In the Song Dynasty, there were two envoys and deputies in the Hanlin Medical Officer Academy. In the Ming Dynasty, the system of Confucianism was imitated to establish medical officials, called Medical Academy, with one head of the department and one model for the county, all without pay. The Qing Dynasty still followed this example.</p>
<p>When we examine the original meaning of the two characters (doctor), those who are in charge of medical administration in today's health bureau personnel and administrative agencies can be called doctors. The Urgency Chapter says that doctors were called medical craftsmen in ancient times. Medical craftsmen can save people's lives just like damage to things can be repaired by craftsmen. The meaning is great! Today's Western doctors all call themselves doctors, which may be a little inconsistent with the ancient meaning.</p>
<p>The Chang'an dialect says: "During the Ming Dynasty, if a woman in the folk was proficient in medical formulas, she would be selected by various government offices to go to the Directorate of Ceremonial. The imperial physicians would hold an election. Those who were selected would be famous and wait for orders. They were called midwives." From this, it can be seen that in ancient times, women who studied medicine were collectively called midwives. Today, some people call female obstetricians midwives, which makes the meaning too narrow.</p>
<h3>Proxy Marriage in Southeast Asia Qiushui</h3>
<p>Recently, I received a letter from my friend Mr. Li in Southeast Asia, saying that a peculiar proxy marriage ceremony was held recently in Semarang, Java, which is rare in modern marriage ceremonies.</p>
<p>The reason is that a Mr. Jack Sieblinct, an employee of the Dutch-owned Javanese Railway Department, met a woman named Oliver Shadfrd in England when he was on a business trip. They fell in love at first sight and got engaged. Later, Jack returned to Southeast Asia, while Oliver remained in England, working in a department store. The wedding was not held due to her busy work. In February of this year, Jack proposed to marry in Java, asking Oliver to come to Southeast Asia as soon as possible. Oliver also nodded in agreement. Before long, the wedding date was set. However, Oliver was unable to make the trip due to her mother's illness. Jack in Java had prepared everything, and friends and relatives gathered. It was difficult to postpone the wedding. On the wedding day, there was no way to think about it, so he had to hire a female friend to pretend to be Oliver to perform the wedding ceremony.</p>
<p>After the wedding ceremony was completed, they were sent to the bridal chamber. Those who did not know believed that they were a real couple. If the wedding ceremony can be performed by proxy, then a customer does not need to bother two masters. This female friend should also bear the lack of things on the bed. Isn't it interesting?</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from Southeast Asia (21) Linghua</h3>
<p>The second phase: Rome destroyed the Jews. General Titus conquered Jerusalem, killing 100,000 people and plundering 97,000. He salted the city of Jerusalem to prevent plants from growing. Who knew that unconsciously after the Christian era, the Jews gave birth to Jesus and a God. The Romans moved the Eastern Jewish God to the whole of Europe. In the year 313 AD, Emperor Constantine the Great made him the state religion. Therefore, this God's magical hat made in Eastern Judah is really amazing. Europeans have been wearing it until now. In 1930, it spread to the world. Although new scientists want to overthrow it, most people are still wearing it respectfully. Therefore, the historian Myers said, "The Romans conquered the Jewish body, and the Jews conquered the Roman soul." It is not known who is better. This is the second phase of Eastern and Western cultural contact.</p>
<p>622 AD, the year of Emperor Taizong of Tang ascended the throne, is also called the year of Hegira. What is this Hegira? In Asia, in the Arab region, there was a new God. The mission sent by this new God was a camel caravan named Mohammed. He married his forty-year-old widow owner, Kanija. The couple created a new religion, which is now the Islam. 622 AD is the year of the era. His God is also great love. However, by 750 AD, the Muslim forces reached Spain in the west and the Chinese western border in the east, which Guo Ziyi called the Uyghurs. Du Fu's poem praises. This God is so powerful. After that, there was a war with the Christian God for about two hundred years. The Crusades were carried out seven or eight times. From the first Crusade in 1095 to the seventh in 1244. The result was that the Muslim countries took Jerusalem, the holy land. You know that Islam is so powerful. It turns out that the culture of Islam contains Indian and Chinese culture. (According to H. G. Wells Outlines of History) It turns out that Europeans in the Middle Ages were superstitious about theocracy. They were not allowed to eat medicine when they were sick. They could only listen to the priest's prayers. If the life announcement was not good, it was God's calling him to die. He had to be buried. The result of the Eastern Expedition was that the Muslim prescriptions and mathematics were passed to Europe. Algebra was originally created by the Muslims. Chemistry is also. There is also the philosophy of Hila. Europeans had already lost it. It was translated into Latin through Muslim universities. You see how poor European culture was at that time. This is the old account of the Tang and Song Dynasties. The third contact between Eastern and Western cultures. The modern representative of maritime civilization is the British. The origin of British culture can be traced back to the end of the 6th century. There was a Roman bishop named Pope Gregory the Great. One day he was wandering around the city of Rome and saw some newly arrived children being sold in the slave market. The children were very decent. He asked where they came from. They replied that they came from England Angles. The bishop was moved by the sound and thought that it came from the angel's side. Because the sounds of angel and England are very similar. So he decided to spread Christianity to England. By the 7th century, the British had almost accepted Christianity, and then they had a culture. This happened during the time of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, Li Bai, and Yang Guifei.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (1) (8) (2) Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Episode 10: Red Flames Soar, and the Goulan (Theater) Showcases a Filial Daughter. The Red Carpet Is Spread, and a Famous Performer Is Met on the Spot.</p>
<p>That Liu Yinbo's father lived in Shanghai. When he returned to China, of course, he would come to Shanghai. And the niece of that Envoy Fang, who was harmed, also lived in Shanghai. Moreover, she was studying at a church girls' school in Shanghai. She was still a cousin of Xing Shu's fiancée. The two cousins were studying at a girls' school. Now, hearing that Xing Shu's marriage was successful, Yinbo's marriage was then brought up. Yinbo's temperament, however, was different from that of his brother. He was extremely forthright, and often a matter was settled in just a few words. In recent marriages, the man and woman must first meet each other, not like in the past, groping in the dark until after the wedding night before meeting. Even if they were unwilling in their hearts, by that time the die was cast, and there was nothing that could be done. Now, after Yinbo met his fiancée, he immediately agreed and immediately began preparing for the wedding. Strangely, his marriage was discussed later than that of his brother Xing Shu, but it was successful first. In a few months, he was preparing to get married. That was also what his old father meant. If Yinbo had not been matched, then Xing Shu had already been engaged, so it would have been okay for Xing Shu to get married first. Now that Yinbo had been matched, and was also a relative of the Fang family, then he was the older brother after all, so it would be appropriate for Yinbo to get married first. Yinbo did not like to do as much research as Xing Shu. Because after he got married, he would go to the Beijing-Tianjin area. Yinbo's social circle was wider than Xing Shu's. The people he knew were all from the financial world. He himself had studied banking, so he had great hopes of becoming a bank manager. It is said that after Yinbo's marriage was successful, he soon chose the wedding day. It was just in the lower part of April, when the weather was gradually getting warmer, but it had not yet reached the scorching heat. The place where they got married was the Weichun Garden. Weichun Garden had a large Western-style building, which has been mentioned several times in the previous books. Because many male and female guests had to be gathered together, the large hall of this Weichun Garden was the most suitable place. Originally, that place was called Anhui Estate. It could really be said to be both safe and suitable. Moreover, that place was also very suitable for banquets and watching operas. A stage was set up in the center, and several dozen tables could be set up along the stage all the way to the entrance. The upstairs was also a gallery where one could walk around. Looking down from upstairs, it was very clear. It was more casual and comfortable than the boxes in the theater. Liu Yinbo had already prepared at that time. When it came time to take their seats, he invited many male guests to eat, drink, and watch the opera upstairs. He invited many female guests to eat, drink, and watch the opera upstairs. Because in China at that time, there was not much talk about public places where men and women could sit together.</p>

<h3>Brief Account of April Yarn and Cotton Delivery</h3>
<p>Yarn Volume: 14,200 bales</p>
<p>Cotton Volume: 20,900 dan</p>
<p>The Benchmark Delivery Price was 153 taels: The situation at the beginning of the month was uncertain. Since a factory unintentionally refused to accept goods in March, the market was panic-stricken. At that time, there were many discussions in the business community, and the customers saw that the overall situation in Shanghai was unfavorable. Although there was business, they did not dare to purchase. Therefore, transactions were particularly quiet, and there were many rumors about the situation. The amount of unsold goods in yarn and cloth warehouses gradually increased, so everyone had to sell at 45 taels. The seller's pressure became stronger, and that factory remained silent. The lowest price seen was 147 taels and 0.08 taels. Later, a large short position covered about 20,000 bales, and a manufacturer purchased 3,000 bales at a limited price of 9 taels. The market rose sharply. At the same time, Shenxin and Yongan factories also bought in, and Hengda's long position had this assistance, making their attitude tougher. Retail investors were panicked by this news, and the buying atmosphere was relatively strong for a time, with the highest price reaching 55 taels and 0.05 taels. Before long, the market softened, as Dafeng, a large short seller, had collected thousands of bales of spot yarn in the market, preparing for delivery. The market price then fell back to 51 taels and 0.06 taels, but Hengda firmly accepted 9,000 bales. On the last day, retail investors covered their short positions, and the price rose back to 54 taels. As a result, the delivery price was 153 taels, and the delivery volume was 14,200 bales. Actual delivery was 9,100 bales, and the remaining 5,100 bales were delivered privately. The goods included 3,650 bales of 20-count Wufu, 2,800 bales of Shepherd, 1,150 bales of 10-count Peacock, 350 bales of Bao Yi, 700 bales of Double Happiness, 150 bales of Deli, and 300 bales of Red Lotus Bee.

<p>Hankou Cotton Benchmark Delivery Price 36.5 taels: At the beginning of April, the Hankou Cotton market was dull. Most people thought the market was soft, as the price fell sharply at the last trading session in March. At that time, American cotton was also dim and sluggish, and the market was quiet, hovering around 5.23 taels. Before long, American cotton rose, sources of supply were lacking, and the Shanghai port had limited inventory. Therefore, the Hankou Cotton group had a strong bullish sentiment and was unwilling to let go. The market trend increased. Around the 20th, Japanese merchants absorbed a huge amount of near-month cotton, preparing to receive the goods and squeeze the short positions. Suddenly, it broke through the 6 tael mark. Retail investors saw that the overall situation was good and had to cover their short positions. The market became tighter and tighter, reaching a high of 36 taels and 0.55 taels. The delivery price was 36 taels and 0.05 taels, and the delivery volume was 20,900 dan. Japanese merchants received most of the Tai Cang Huoji and Shaanxi cotton. The Hankou and Shanghai cotton groups delivered the goods. The dan amounts for both receiving and delivering parties are listed below:</p>

<h3>American Cotton Falls After a Previous Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was mixed due to the possibility of large-scale deliveries. It was firm due to short covering, but weakened after rain in the drought area. The near-term price rose by 4 points, while the far-term price fell by 2 to 4 points. The spot price remained unchanged. British cotton futures rose by 1 to 7 points, and the spot price fell by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. Indian cotton softened due to dumping by European exporters, with Pingguoer near-term and far-term falling by 1 rupee, Aomura falling by 2 rupees, and the far-term falling by 1 rupee, and Bairoxi falling by 1 rupee, and the far-term falling by 2 rupees. The original telegram records are on the left (telegram dated 28th):</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea Silk Factories are Increasingly in Danger</h3>
<p>New Silk European Sales Stagnant... Old Silk Prices Continue to Fall</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has been unfavorable, and silkworm production in various inland areas has been poor. The foreign silk market is increasingly sluggish, and Japanese silk prices have plummeted, especially for futures silk. Shanghai manufacturers are eager to sell their new silkworm cocoon futures as the new cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang are about to hit the market. However, European buyers are holding back due to the extremely low price of Japanese silk. They are constantly suppressing the prices of old cocoons and raw silk. Manufacturers are reluctantly reducing prices for sales, and their business is becoming increasingly precarious. Yesterday, Huatong brought 20 bales of Lu factory silk from the inland, and Ganli brought 30 bales of Lu factory silk from Shandong. Prices are continuing to weaken. Chinese silk merchants are pessimistic about the future of the silk market.</p>
<h3>Haining Cocoon Harvest is Generally Poor</h3>
<p>Currently in the Great Sleep Stage... Latest, One Week Before Cocoons Can Be Spun</p>
<p>In recent years, sericulture in Haining's cities and towns has progressed rapidly, with cocoon production increasing daily, and the quality of cocoons is also good. This year, farmers have increased their feeding amounts because the government distributed improved varieties. The silkworm harvest was unchanged around the second sleep stage, but the weather suddenly changed during the third sleep stage. Initially, there were wind and hailstorms, damaging the mulberry buds. Then, there was extreme heat and cold, and even continuous spring rain, which greatly affected the silkworms. Some had diarrhea due to eating mixed leaves, and others died from the erratic temperatures. They are now in the great sleep stage. The early batches have already started to shed leaves. The weather is still not clear in the four townships, and the silkworm harvest is generally poor. At the latest, the silkworms of the large batches can be spun in one week, and the cocoon shops will be able to open their scales around the 7th or 8th of the month.</p>
<h3>Wuyi and Qimen New Tea Harvest Starts Early</h3>
<p>The new tea in Zhouyuan, Wuyi, is growing very fast due to the recent hot weather and several rainy days. The spring tea in Grain Rain is ready to be harvested. Most tea farmers, in light of the soaring rice prices and the scarcity and high cost of labor, are opening their gardens early, except for those who have hired tea workers from the past year and can delay opening their gardens. Yesterday and today (the 20th), a small number of tea farmers in the northern townships have already started picking and processing to avoid being unable to pick in time. The tea farmers in the various mountain tea areas are borrowing tea and rice from tea shops and grain shops to prepare for entering the market.</p>
<p>The development period of black tea in Qimen and Fuliang was previously earlier than that of green tea. In recent years, due to climate reasons, the garden opening and roasting have started at the same time as green tea. Recently, the head tea of the Qimen and Fuliang routes has been harvested and roasted by most mountain households. Tea shops have also opened their doors one after another, sending staff to set up scales and establish branches to buy tea. If the weather is sunny in the coming days and there is no more rain, the head tea will be conducive to drying and the quality is expected to be excellent. However, the tea shops are affected by the Jingdezhen ban on rice exports, and most of the rice they purchased has not been shipped. In addition, as the new tea is being harvested, they urgently need to open their scales, so they first enter the mountains and open their shops before finding ways to raise grain and rice to help the workers. This has become a major problem for tea shops at present.</p>
<h3>Grain River Under Rice Market Continues to Soften</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, few boats arrived. As the month is coming to an end, the market is becoming increasingly quiet. The inventory of high-quality white japonica rice in the river is gradually decreasing, and the market is still flat. The inventory of medium and lower-quality japonica rice is still thick, and sales are sluggish, softening by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. Thin indica rice has already reached 19 yuan within the customs, and sales are declining. Yangdu xian rice is almost extinct. Although there are one or two cargo ships, the prices are difficult to match, so the market situation is stable. White yuan rice is also sluggish. Guest sales are very limited due to the silver market relationship, and the market is weak by nearly 0.1 yuan. High-quality Bianyuan rice opens at 18 yuan on the left side of the customs.</p>
<p>Confluence: Six or seven cargo ships arrived at the river, entering with stagnant wood, and the overall market was weak. Changbang machine-milled japonica rice still needs 20 yuan. The price of this item is expected to last for a long time. Sales of Suzhou and Tongzhou white japonica rice are sluggish, because retail customers in rural areas are purchasing foreign rice. Therefore, it is difficult for japonica rice below the customs to develop. It is completely suppressed by foreign rice, so it continues to fall by half a corner. Thin early indica rice such as Lian Tang and Si Jing of the Nanbang area is not selling well, so the recent arrival of supplies has also been sparse, and the market is stable. Yangdu jian rice is also extremely scarce here, and the market is quite stable. Bianyuan rice is inactive in both arrival and sales, and lacks glory and humiliation for the time being.</p>
<h3>Near-Term Noodles See Sharp Drop</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the noodle market, near-term prices fell sharply, and far-term prices stabilized. This month, the price was maintained at the 0.05 yuan mark until noon, but market confidence became more uncertain in the afternoon, and the price dropped sharply, falling to a low of 2.4825 taels. This sudden drop seemed unexpected, but the recent actual sales have been surprisingly quiet, and Fufeng's short position has no intention of making up for a small amount. The market has the potential to fall for a long time. Because actual sales are not good, and the lack of warehouse receipts makes it difficult for the long positions to contend, it is also due to the environment not allowing it. The May market was also sluggish, with little improvement. From June to September, the long positions held up, and there were few ups and downs. Looking at the opening price of the month, May is at a low point, but if sales are not smooth, the factory inventory is still abundant. Considering the situation in the past month, it is feared that it will ultimately be sluggish. As a result, this month was lower than the previous day by 0.015, May was lower by 0.01, June was lower by 0.0025, July to September did not move, and August improved by 0.0025.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Presents a Situation of Mutual Contention</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market initially stabilized due to foreign wheat rising by 0.4 or 0.5 yuan, but in the afternoon, the weather was again sunny and rainy, and the market atmosphere was slightly sluggish. However, the ups and downs were not large, and the situation was that of mutual contention. Most of the long positions are occupied by Wuxi merchants, who are thinking of the final victory before the new goods arrive. Therefore, although the scene is good, the market is rarely outstanding. Only 8 cars were actually delivered for this month's delivery, received by Taikang. The rest were settled by both parties. This is the reason for the poor ending of this month. As a result, June was slightly lower by 0.01, July did not move, August was slightly lower by 0.01, and September was higher by 0.01. The current wheat market's asking price is the same as before, but the factory must enter the customs with 5 taels before they have the intention to purchase. As a result, the traders paid the difference, and more than 9,000 bags were traded. In fact, it seems to be slightly lower. Wheat in Bengbu, Xuzhou, Nansu County, and Qingjiangpu is priced at 5 taels.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Stagnates and Falls by a Corner</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market immediately became sluggish and lost its vigor due to the stagnation of guest merchants, and with the arrival of two new ships, the market price fell by a small corner. Transactions were also quiet. The total market only opened two numbers: 1,000 bags of Saigon, 500 bags of Mindang, 1,000 bags of Xiaojiao, 500 bags of Dajiao, 500 bags of Hong Xiaojiao, 400 bags of rough Qiella rice, and 1,000 bags of Annam japonica rice. Futures market sentiment was stagnant and there were no transactions.</p>
<h3>Sales of Metal White Iron Tiles Increase Sharply</h3>
<p>The recent transactions of white iron tiles have been like bamboo shoots after rain. Most of the transactions are with construction companies on this street, and the decoration is also busy for export to Qingdao and Dalian. Therefore, in the past two or three days, statistics show that more than 1,600 bundles have been sold. The price level is also good due to limited sources and the weakness of the exchange rate. For example, No. 28 is estimated at 12.25 taels per dan, No. 26 is 11.5 taels, and No. 24 is 10.05 taels. It is found that No. 28 is the most popular.</p>
<h3>Bulk Orders of Twisted Lead Wire are Placed</h3>
<p>Coarse lead wires such as No. 10, No. 12, and No. 14 are fast-selling products during the war, so the number of sales has been very high in recent days. Therefore, the market is often in danger of not being able to keep up with demand. Yesterday, overseas orders were very active, with a total of more than 1,700 bundles ordered. The price is generally around 8.5 to 9 taels. However, most of the shipping is being expedited, and it is expected that the arrival of goods will have an impact on the upward price level in the bustling market.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Traders Transport a Large Batch of Eastern Piece Goods</h3>
<p>The piece goods trade was quiet again yesterday, and the Zhejiang route is gradually stopping. However, Ningbo traders transported a large batch of Eastern piece goods yesterday, with more than 300 pieces, of which Yuanyang yarn was the most. Therefore, the spot price of Dian Qiuxiang is in a state of shortage, and the price is still sold at 1.4 taels. A considerable number of stripes and satins and native factory printed cloth were also shipped. In the midst of Zhejiang's increased taxes, a batch of transactions has come to an end, and it is feared that there will be a long period of stagnation afterwards. Whether in Sichuan, Hankou, or Jiangxi, transactions with guest traders are very quiet, and there is no wholesale addition. This trend is rarely seen in history. As a result, the inventory is full, and prices have fallen sharply, especially for printed cloth. If there are ten pieces of dark-colored fabric, they can only be sold for 3.9 taels, which is 0.3 taels lower than last month. A box of 80 pieces has fallen by 24 taels, so those who hold the goods have suffered great losses. Blue striped satins and printed linen yarn have also fallen slightly. White striped linen yarn of Western goods is quite popular in this street. Tailong goods are sold for 0.0185 taels, and Zhonghe goods are sold for 0.019 taels. Sales of blue striped nankeen have been stagnant, and the Shandong and Tianjin traders shipped more than 20 pieces of plain nankeen yarn yesterday.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Hankou Tallow Oil Production Has Stopped</h3>
<p>Tallow oil is usually a time of falling orders for candles and soaps in the summer, but soap factories are in heavy use. The tallow oil lines in the port have thin inventories. A certain famous soap factory was recently sold 400 tons for 18.12 taels, weighed in on the clear skin, with endless deliveries. In the beginning, the news was a secret because the number was a shortage, and the oil had to depend on the Hankou factories to offset deliveries. Later, the outside world gradually became aware of it, and the Hankou traders also heard about it. Therefore, Hankou knew that the port was offsetting shortage numbers, so they tightened prices on purpose. Macheng oil was only 13.6 taels at first, but it has now increased to 13.8 taels. It is said that they want to add 14 taels. Although a lot has been delivered, those who are doing shortages cannot make a profit. Zhuhongchong's Jing is already sold to 14.2 taels, Sanheng is 14 taels, miscellaneous branches weigh around 13.8 to 13.9, and Pingjing is 13.5 to 13.6 taels. Tianjin is 13.1 to 13.2 taels. Also, it is heard that the production areas in the western Hubei and Yichang areas have stopped production. It is feared that the supply will not be very strong, so it is feared that the market cannot hope for low prices.</p>

<h3>The Ten Commandments for Automobile Drivers by Huang Yingdai</h3>
<p>Remarks by Mr. A.R. Erskine, Owner of Studebaker Corporation</p>
<p>Important Issues Worth Noting for Drivers Everywhere</p>
<p>In recent years, the automobile industry has become increasingly developed in countries around the world. As a result, the number of vehicles on the streets has also increased accordingly. With more vehicles, accidents are bound to happen more easily when driving. This is an undeniable principle. However, the main reason for accidents often lies with the drivers themselves. If drivers can be meticulous and attentive, I believe accidents can be avoided. Therefore, in recent times, European and American countries have been thoroughly studying the issue of automobile accidents, seeking ways to prevent them in the hope of reducing the number of accidents. They have paid particular attention to the moral character of drivers and the principles they should adhere to. Mr. A.R. Erskine, owner of the American Studebaker Corporation, has profound knowledge and extensive experience in the automotive industry. Recently, to prevent automobile accidents and unexpected incidents on highland roads, he proposed ten commandments for drivers. If drivers can carefully observe these ten commandments at all times, they will certainly avoid accidents when driving. The translator believes that this issue is of great importance to our automotive community, so he has translated Mr. Erskine's remarks and the ten commandments to prevent accidents for the readers.</p>
<p>Mr. Erskine said that recently, the American automotive community has been paying close attention to the issue of automobile safety, and many researchers have been working on various methods to prevent automobile accidents. However, the opinions expressed and the methods contributed to the automotive community are mostly divergent and inconclusive, leaving drivers at a loss and unable to know what to do. In my opinion, there are only ten simple ways to ensure automobile safety. If everyone can abide by these ten commandments when driving, I believe accidents will be avoided. Most of these ten methods were proposed by Dr. Miller McClintock of the Studebaker Corporation's Automobile Safety Research Committee, who once gave a public lecture at Harvard University. They are of great relevance to transportation methods and safety issues. These ten commandments are the result of extensive research and investigation by the committee over a long period of time and are contributed to society. Their value is self-evident. During the investigation, every city and village was examined. Considering the total population surveyed in various places, it should be over ten million. Therefore, these commandments are reliable and unprecedented. Whether driving in the city or in the countryside, if drivers keep these ten commandments firmly in mind and follow them one by one, disasters will certainly not occur. The ten commandments are explained below to conclude this article, and I hope that readers will keep them in mind and pass them on to drivers. Then, the translator's intention will not be in vain.</p>
<p>(1) Keep your car in good and strong condition at all times, without any defects.</p>
<p>(2) When driving, always maintain control. If you cannot find a way to stop the car when you see vehicles or people in front of you in a split second, it will lead to disaster.</p>
<p>(3) The driver's eyes should always be focused on the road. A moment's negligence can cause a major accident.</p>
<p>(4) When driving, do not cross into the right lane unless there is an accident or it is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>(5) When the wheels are moving forward, do not arbitrarily linger or drive slowly, so as not to obstruct the passage of other vehicles.</p>
<p>(6) When driving, be as courteous as you would be at home. When you see another car passing on the road, give it the opportunity to pass within a possible range.</p>
<p>(7) Drivers should know all the traffic rules established in the city where they are driving. These rules are either established by the automobile association or by the municipal authorities and published in pamphlets, which can be purchased and read.</p>
<p>(8) If an ordinary person is riding with you and has doubts about your driving skills, you should try to boast about your abilities to reassure them.</p>
<p>(9) When driving, do not be angry if the gasoline is clogged. Driving under the influence of alcohol should be avoided even more.</p>
<p>(10) Study the local map carefully and memorize the shortcuts to save driving time.</p>
<h3>Warning to New and Old Car Owners by Li Jiren</h3>
<p>Have You Ever Violated the Following Rules?</p>
<p>With the beautiful spring scenery, there will be many people driving around for pleasure, and the number of new car purchases will also increase sharply. As a result, the number of automobile accidents will also increase. In view of this, General Motors has compiled a simple chapter on driving for the reference of new and old car owners.</p>
<p>(1) Drive on the right or left, depending on the rules of each country. Do not mess up the lane.</p>
<p>(2) Do not honk the horn randomly. Use it according to the situation. For example, when two cars pass each other, the horn must be sounded.</p>
<p>(3) Do not make small turns. Large turns are more stable.</p>
<p>(4) Protect the rights of pedestrians.</p>
<p>(5) Do not rush or compete with other cars for speed.</p>
<p>(6) Pay attention to the new driving regulations and their changes.</p>
<p>(7) Do not misuse the parking lights, and do not rush when the light turns green.</p>
<p>(8) Whether there are police or not, drive according to the regulations.</p>
<p>(9) Always give signals to others with your hands.</p>
<p>The above items are related to social security. The following items are even more important and can prevent many accidents. The most important ones are listed below:</p>
<p>(10) Maintain the safety and normal condition of the car. Pay attention to the condition of the tires and air pressure.</p>
<p>(11) Test the intensity and range of the headlights every three months.</p>
<p>(12) The rearview mirror must be wiped clean so that you can see clearly.</p>
<p>(13) Inflate the tires every two weeks. Replace the tires immediately after the tire treads are worn.</p>
<p>(14) Always pay attention to all the parts inside the car.</p>
<p>(15) The valves, wheels, sliding surfaces, fan belts, oil injectors, front wheels, and steering mechanisms should be regularly maintained.</p>
<p>(16) Do not start a cold engine too quickly. Check the thermometer before starting it.</p>
<p>(17) Observe the perfect condition of the windshield and wipers. Do not let the wipers lose their function due to oxidation.</p>
<p>(18) The lubrication of the steering mechanism should be thorough and should be maintained frequently.</p>
<p>(19) Do not drive fast uphill.</p>
<p>(20) Always add water to the battery and keep it clean.</p>
<p>(21) Refer to automobile books and pay special attention to the chapter on lubrication.</p>
<p>(22) Apply common sense when driving.</p>
<p>(23) Remove carbon deposits at least twice a year. If new and old car owners can implement the above driving rules and take care of the car, accidents will be reduced, costs will be saved, and society will be more secure.</p>

<h3>The National Government Repurchases a Large Batch of Dodge Trucks</h3>
<p>The Dodge Brothers trucks, known for their durability, excellence, affordability, and fuel efficiency, are sold by the China Motor Company in this city. The Nanjing Central Government, in light of the excellent performance of the large batch of Dodge trucks purchased for the first time, has specially repurchased more trucks from the company. Prior to this, all truck manufacturers wanted to undertake this huge transaction, so they competed to contribute their products to the authorities for selection. However, the selectors ultimately chose Dodge Brothers trucks. The reason why the authorities deeply admired them and were happy to purchase them is that they are convenient and time-saving. Time is money, and saving time is saving money. The widespread sales of Dodge trucks have a reason.</p>
<p>Dodge Brothers trucks are extremely fast at starting and driving on the road. They are very reliable, so the work is satisfactory, and the time spent is very economical. Regardless of whether the truck is fully loaded, the distribution and application of its power are appropriate. In addition, management is easy, driving is safe, and loading and unloading are simple, so drivers save effort, time, and energy, and benefit greatly. In short, in terms of work and travel, Dodge trucks can save their owners a lot of time and countless money. In other words, they can be the owner's only</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>profit-generating tool. This can be proven by examining and testing Dodge vehicles of all types.</p>
<p>Dodge Brothers truck chassis and chassis, as well as the entire body, are exquisitely superior and unmatched. The price is unprecedentedly affordable. All of this can be seen from its styling, photography, quality, appearance, abundance of power, magnificence of function, longevity, sturdiness of manufacture, and the thoroughness of service from Dodge dealers around the world. As for the installation of hydraulic four-wheel brakes, it enables drivers to handle everything with ease, control freely, safely and reliably, which is extremely valuable.</p>
<p>It is heard that although the price of Dodge trucks sold by the China Motor Company to the National Government this time has increased due to the soaring gold prices and increased costs, the selling price is still particularly affordable. This is because the transaction is not a one-time event, and it is hoped that the source of patronage will be continuous. The price level must be particularly self-denying, and it can be asserted that the National Government will be more willing to deal with the company in the future.</p>
<p>Mr. Friedman, General Manager of the China Motor Company, is a member of the Chamber of Commerce. He is astute, capable, and well-managed. He is an extremely honest merchant, and his character is excellent, and he is highly respected by customers and the general public. For example, the vehicle purchase specialists sent by the National Government on several occasions have praised Mr. Friedman's fair transactions, honesty, enthusiastic reception, and special self-denial. In addition, Mr. Zhou Mengxian, the Chinese General Manager of the company, is young, handsome, quick at work, and has extensive social connections. Important figures in the political and business circles all interact with him, and he is amiable and approachable, and people are happy to deal with him. Mr. Zhou has made great efforts in the company's increasingly prosperous business.</p>
<h3>The Winding and Beautiful Roads of Jiangsu Province, Thousands of Miles Long</h3>
<p>In recent years, the foundation of the country has been roughly laid, and political tutelage has begun. Although the situation is still inevitably fluctuating, the southeastern half of the country is more stable than other provinces. Therefore, all construction projects are fortunately proceeding in an orderly manner. Jiangsu Province is the location of the national capital and is the focus of national attention. Years of construction have been particularly effortful. In terms of road administration, the roads that have been built between counties and towns have achieved considerable results. Automobiles come and go, and travel is convenient. The progress of transportation is much better than in the past. Recently, the Jiangsu Construction Department, in view of the increasing density of county roads, deems it necessary to make comprehensive plans to unite and unify them in order to achieve consistent transportation and open up rich resources. It has specially established five main lines in accordance with the provincial road standards. Some sections have been built, while others have not yet been constructed. Stretching for thousands of miles, they cover the north and south of the Yangtze River and are truly a fundamental plan for road administration. Now that the system has been established, active construction will be carried out. Once the routes are connected, all kinds of benefits will undoubtedly be developed. The five major trunk roads are briefly described below.</p>

<p>Mr. Coleman, an automobile transportation expert, is the Director of Trucks and Long-Distance Vehicles at the American General Motors Manufacturing Company. He arrived in Shanghai the other day. Mr. Coleman's visit to China is specifically to investigate the development of the automobile transportation industry in our country and to investigate the business status of the Shanghai General Motors Company branch. Recently, people in the Chinese and Western automotive industries have hosted banquets to welcome him. Mr. Coleman will stay for a few days and then return to the United States.</p>
<p>(1) Guazhou-Xuzhou Line: This line starts from Guazhou on the north bank of the Yangtze River, runs north along the Grand Canal, passes through Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Baoying, Qingjiangpu, Siyang, Suqian, Suining, and reaches Xuzhou. It is found that the cities and towns along the line are mostly commercial centers in northern Jiangsu. After the roads are opened, not only will the traffic in the counties of northern Jiangsu become convenient, but also the railways of Longhai and Jinpu will be connected with each other, and transportation will inevitably develop. The section from Yangzhou to Zhongxing, which is about 240 miles long, has been built and opened to traffic. According to the current plan of the Construction Department, this road has roughly taken shape and is an important trunk line in northern Jiangsu. It is planned to be completed first to complete the entire project.</p>
<p>(2) Beijing-Shanghai Line: There are many mountainous areas along the line, starting from Nanjing, running south, passing through Jurong, Liyang to Yixing, and running east along Taihu Lake, passing through Wuxi, Dangshu, and Taicang to reach Shanghai. The section from Beijing to Yixing is connected to the Hangzhou-Changxing line in Zhejiang Province, which is a major section of the Beijing-Hangzhou line, which has been built and opened to traffic. The last section is the Shanghai-Taicang Road, which has also been completed. Only the section from Yixing to Changshu in the middle needs to be built.</p>
<p>(3) Tonghai Line: This line starts from Nantong, passes through Haian, Dongtai, Yancheng, Funing, Guanyun, to Haizhou. Nantong and Haizhou are both important cities in Jiangsu Province. One is located at the port of the Yangtze River, and its industry is well-developed. The other is the end point of the Longhai Railway, and transportation is extremely prosperous. With the completion of the entire road, the development of industry and commerce in the cities along the line will inevitably increase greatly. The section from Nantong to Haian has been built, which is more than 180 miles long. Another branch line from Funing to Huaian is planned to be built to connect with the first main line.</p>
<p>(4) Haipu Line: From Haimen through Nantong, Jingjiang, Taixing, Taizhou, Yangzhou, Yizheng, Liuhe, Pukou, to Jiangpu. After this road is built, it will greatly increase the transportation convenience of the cities and towns and can save the congestion of the small tributaries of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>(5) Beijing-Changshu Line: Starting from Nanjing, passing through Jurong, Jintan, Changzhou, Jiangyin, to Changshu. The area through which the line passes is mostly affluent, and prosperous transportation can be predicted.</p>
<p>The above five major trunk lines are about 3,500 miles long. In addition to the completed sections, there are still many that have not been built, which requires a lot of money. It is now heard that one portion of the road construction funds has been obtained by the provincial government. The implementation of the work should be just around the corner.</p>

<p>Chinese Car Buyers Focus on Trademarks: Automobiles are widely sold in China, and there are many brands. When Chinese people buy new cars, they must first ask what kind of trademark it is before making a decision. Therefore, automotive businesses in China pay attention to automotive trademarks. The only way to popularize them is to make large-scale advertisements so that everyone knows them. Chinese language is complex and the tones are different. To choose a car trademark name, you must choose a letter that is homophonic and meaningful. These names are carefully discussed with local geography to ensure they are appropriate before they can be explored and set as the standard.</p>
<p>The Meaning of General Motors Names: Buick is the most famous and greatest automobile in China, so it is named Buick. "Bie" means unique, and "Ke" means strong.

Chevrolet automobiles are called for their purity and durability. The name of Cadillac automobiles contains the meaning of wealth. The car body is spacious, the style is magnificent, the movement is agile, and the power is strong. With sixteen cylinders, its value is more expensive.

<p>Increased Number of Automobiles in Guangdong: The number of privately owned automobiles in Guangdong has increased greatly recently. According to the latest survey, the total number of automobiles is now about 625, an average of one car per thousand people. At the same time, the roads have been widened, especially in densely populated areas, where the streets have been widened. However, good things are often difficult to achieve. Road construction plans have been repeatedly interrupted by internal strife. It is recently heard that the authorities are planning to open a major road directly from Guangdong to Hong Kong.</p>

The roads are long and the streets are wide, and the transportation is convenient. The current automobile roads pass through important cities. Recently, a road connecting the Americas has been built, connecting the North American Avenue. Passenger and freight transportation are all done by automobile. The time is short and the cost is low. Therefore, Mexico's road construction plan this year is to expand. According to last year's statistics, Mexico has a total of 54,000 passenger cars, 4,300 buses, and 13,800 trucks. This year, the Mexican government plans to use 11.5 million yuan for road construction, so that the roads in the country are accessible in all directions. The development of the automobile industry in the future is limitless.</p>

Director Chuan Zhu will soon lead the actors to personally go to the location to film, aiming for authenticity in the plot.
