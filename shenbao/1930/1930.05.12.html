<h3>美之海軍派與公約</h3>
<p>此次倫敦會議閉幕時記者即慮軍縮之效果未見而先啓内部之糾紛蓋亦有見乎此次會議各國内部之主張殊未一致也外交派須兼顧國外外交情勢財政派須兼顧國内財政情勢而海軍派則祗顧國防不問其他因之三派意見常發生衝突如此次美參院中之海軍派運動阻止批准公約發生劇烈之爭議即其一證也美國海軍派標榜所謂新海軍政策蓋巳久矣所謂新海軍政策者即世界注目之需費二億七千四百萬金元之擴張海軍造艦案是也該案於一九二七年两派在參院劇烈辯論後雖經柯立芝總統提出削除造艦期限案稍資補救然卒因海軍派之猛烈運動幾於全部通過即可見美海軍派之勢力矣自美國通過此鉅大之造艦案各國海軍受其影響皆起而競爭造艦當時美國一方面大倡和平而一方面又擴張海軍故論者皆料華盛頓會議所準備之下次海軍會議必無開成希望乃不意預料不成之海軍會議竟於倫敦實現之誠不免出於意外然究之美海軍派之雄心未巳雖此次所提之造艦案不如會議前所提造艦案之鉅大然亟亟焉以求充足與英同等之量又亟亟以謀阻止通過公約於議院是倫敦會議之開與不開又何異耶</p>
<p>今日各國之不滿於海軍公約者固不祗一美亟亟焉討論進行造艦計劃者亦不祗一美然而各國之海軍皆以美之海軍馬首是瞻而美之海軍派如是是豈主張和平之初心哉</p>

<h3>列國準備毒氣戰爭</h3>
<p>軍事化學研究日精毒氣利用有增無巳</p>
<p>復旦社云化學戰爭之歷史雖僅有十餘年然各國研究之殷與發明之多至足驚人海牙和平會議雖於一八九九年明令禁止交戰國運用毒氣但至歐戰發生各自爲謀毒氣利用有增無巳是則海牙條約亦不過一紙具文而巳茲將各國準備毒氣戰爭之大概調查如下</p>
<p>（一）德國爲最先使用毒氣之國亦爲對此最有準備之國盡人皆知德之染料工業最爲發達染料工廠於二十四小時之内即可攺爲毒氣製造廠至於研究工作則集中於各大學及柏林之物理化學研究所在大戰時只拜耳顔料廠一所曾出過下列各種毒氣芥辣毒氣四千八百噸三氣化蟻酸一烷基一萬二千噸溴化八炭㷍五百噸吸氣活性炭八百十噸緣化苦味酸六千噸</p>
<p>其餘與拜耳同量效力之廠尙有拔地沙顔料廠可拉廠賣士他廠等多家</p>
<p>（二）美國有化學戰爭服務局之組織該局内分研究製造防禦醫學等科各科人員在大戰終結時計有長官四○六六人一九一七年六月一日至一九一八年六月一日一年之間僅研究一科巳用去美金二百五十萬元此外更於厄治武德兵工廠内設有軍事化學專校各大學設立軍事化學專科者如麻省工專米西干大學·南達古他大學等厄治武德兵工廠只於一九一八年十一月一個月之内曾出下列之毒氣四氣化鑽三十噸四綠化錫九十噸白燐百噸溴　化㷍九十噸芥辣毒氣九百噸光氣一千五十噸綠化苦味酸一千五百噸綠氣二千四百噸（三）法國自一九二二年以來全國化學家均須在軍政部登記以便隨時調遣更於一九二四年設立軍事化學訓練所由著名化學家穆敎授主其事在大戰時期法國曾出産毒氣如下綠氣二千四百噸光氣一萬六千噸費生賴氣四千噸綠化苦味酸五百噸四氣化錫四千噸二氣化砷二千七百噸四綠化鑽二百噸</p>
<p>（四）英國設有軍事化學委員會陸軍部另有化學科現下計有該科職員一百五十餘人於一九二五年用費爲二七三·○○○金磅其最近用費當比較爲多各大學及科學機關皆竭力研究總機關設在波興斐爾特</p>
<p>（五）日本近數年來財政困難巳報達極點惟因國防化學之要緊尙免力由國庫提出日金五百萬元創辦一化學戰爭研究所</p>
<p>（六）俄國所有之毒氣廠分設於下列各處莫斯科·基輔·却哥斯摩稜斯科·西比利亞·伊爾庫次克其公共樓宇重要機關之新建築均巳特别裝設防拒毒氣之窗檽其軍事化學之訓練班巳加緊工作上两星期報載俄國政府曾下令全國婦女黨員均須練習也禦毒氣器具之使用</p>
<p>其餘如捷克斯拉夫在奥羅摩次波蘭在華沙西班牙在呈斐南多及聖摩丁等處均有軍事化學專科學校之設</p>
<p>各國積極備戰均諱莫如深以上所述均屬戰時情况然其進行之猛研究之精今當更勝於昔也吾人不可專注意於其軍隊額軍艦額之規定更須就其顔料廠肥料廠廠氣凝定廠之數量及其他化學試騐室科學研究所之内容加以觀察方可知該國之戰門力之程度也</p>

<h3>（一）二投手人才出衆</h3>
<p>投手一職占全隊重要位置敵人生死之權操在其手腕之中故非有健硬之鐵臂神化之曲折以及久戰之經騐者不克當此重任前日中華投手乃程炳觀而非鍾友昨日則所謂第一流投手鍾友者親自出馬矣名將手段畢竟可觀終局僅予對方得有二記安打詢實不易日本投手平井海上著名投手之一其出球也迅速度中富有曲綫擊之不易與鍾友較堪稱仲伯難分高下夫以人才出衆之中日二投手一旦相逢互顯身手局勢之緊凑精彩之倍見當在意料之中矣</p>
<h3>（二）顯神通堅壁相持</h3>
<p>中日投手技術之出象巳如上述而外翼内壘及接手諸人之球藝亦超人一等故擊者不失之於初塲即被殺於半途能得全功者幾如登天之難日本首先人攻三人均未至一壘而出局輸及中華如出一輒第一局由茲告終第二局日本仍未得志僅田邊得一安打身占一壘而巳中華林炎乘二壘發生錯誤之時占據一壘乃雄心勃勃潛偷二壘未成出局此外無足述巳第三局日本高橋因四球數而占一壘後擬偷向二壘被中華接手蔡運平窺得急行傳送先人到壘半途出塲餘子均無發展中華程觀炳鐵臂振起得一安打占一壘鍾友作一犧牲打程進據二壘後之二人咸未得志程亦隨之中止徒呼奈何第四第五两局中日均難進展總之以前五局雙方各顯神通堅壁相持所可紀述者（一）中日各得一安打（二）中華曾一度進展至二壘日則始終未越一壘</p>
<h3>（三）决生死將士用命</h3>
<p>第六局起形勢緊張高橋得天之幸又以四球數而走一壘平井犧牲打高上二壘後高又乘機偷得三壘其時擊者乃牧球爲投手接住初向三壘一揚高遂不敢前進繼捷送一壘先牧到壘牧之出塲與高之不敢進展者投手之功也最後木本一球爲老將馮恩賜接得全軍遂得死裏逃生平安過去繼而中華三人登塲均先後被殺第七局爲當日勝負之樞鈕雙方將士用命努力奮鬥藤原球出甚高接手接之落地藤原進據一壘繼而藤原以凡橋之犧牲打占得二壘終得力於梅本之安打首先歸壘爲日本開紀錄梅本亦占在二壘然而後之二人先後被殺陣勢另佈中華乃反守爲攻矣初陸樹階一擊登壘繼偷壘成功加以馮玉和之安打陸居三壘馮占一壘在蔡運平擊球時日本接手忽而漏球陸飛步歸壘馮亦高據三壘蔡作一犧牲打馮又歸壘是局中獲二分日得一分第八局中日投手又各　驚人之表演三壘之上無人問鼎第九局日又進展不利中華則以勝利在握固無須再戰遂放棄不賽矣九局比賽告終中華以二比一勝日本</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>付之一笑海客</p>
<p>醫生你的丈夫現在巳出了危險的時期可以不死了　　病者之妻但是前三天你不是說他在十天以内一定要死的麽醫生是的只爲我的醫術高明巳把他救了回來以後漸有復元之望</p>
<p>病者之妻呀先生那叫我怎麽辦我將所有的衣服首飾都質了錢給他辦好衣衾棺槨了　　法官（問罪犯）你今年幾歲罪犯我不知道</p>
<p>法官那麽你幾時生的</p>
<p>罪犯你爲甚麽問我的年歲生日難道要送一份壽禮給我麽不用客氣不用客氣</p>
<p>妻你看日本一國並不很大當初怎能打敗那偌大的俄羅斯</p>
<p>夫親愛的但你自巳也長得並不大而我却比你大得多了爲甚麽也常常要被你屈服呢</p>
<p>甲女今天我去看一位美容醫生問他有甚麽法子能使我的面貌常覺得年輕乙女他怎麽說</p>
<p>甲女他喚我常和年紀長我二十歲的太太們同在一起自然覺得年輕了</p>
<h3>日本女子對於婚姻之意見</h3>
<p>秋水</p>
<p>頃據神户通訊謂在該處新近舉行一婚姻問題測騐會與會者有女子二千六百三十八人均係自同處女子高等學校中畢業者其中問題足爲社會學家之參考爰爲述之如下</p>
<p>願守獨身主義者爲數極少此交測騐其第一問題即爲汝欲結婚否答案中有二千四百七十九人願意結婚其餘僅三十六人謂結緍無趣味願守獨身主義於是可知男女之結合天性使然若無激刺或其他特另之原因結婚實爲人類之所必需不知此三十六人之戀愛史中包含若干悲慘事也</p>
<p>丈夫選擇多聽自父母主張次問選擇丈夫由父母乎抑聽自主乎其答案可分三派其第一派爲數最多答稱婚姻當由父母之命與媒約之言而定計七百五十三人第二派則主張須嫁於自己所愛之人爲數一百八十一人第二派爲折衷之論調謂婚姻之定局父母有最後判斷之權先由自己選擇並不妨提出數名之候補丈夫以待父母之决定爲數一千四百八十人由此觀察則此種日本女子雖己飽受歐西之新思想而仍有多數之保守本國之舊觀念者日本人之守舊亦可想見矣</p>
<p>需要機關雇用員做丈夫第三問題更覺有趣即問汝希望嫁於何種之丈夫其答案之大多數謂願嫁與有一定薪金之政府或商業機關之雇員爲數得九百八十一敎員次之贊成者二百零七人軍士文次之贊成者一百二十九人（按日本有一地名希馬極者其地有第十師之軍隊駐紮軍人之勢力極大某次舉行同樣之婚姻問測騐關於此問題答案中有大多數希望嫁與軍士）其他如新聞記者則多無人顧問大約以其工作多在夜間香閨燈下少人陪伴之故新聞記者聞之或將自嘆其無艶福乎一笑又航空爲近來日本最發達之事業而此次答案則僅有一人願嫁與飛行家亦殊可怪</p>
<p>日本女子善操家政第四問題爲結婚後作何事業答案之九百五十八人謂將操治家政二百零八人謂仍願讀書五百二十一人願求職業一百十一人謂希望從事於其所愛好之工作按日本女子善操家政頗類似我國之女子於此答案亦可窺見趣旨之所在矣</p>
<h3>首都之報販履冰</h3>
<p>余于役首都常往來下關浦口間以性喜閱報時與報販相交接一載以還識者頗衆因記其瑣事以供談料首都地域頗廣報紙自滬來者率在下午四句鐘經報販取後分送入於讀者之手至速當在四時半若寓居城内恒須於下午六時左右始到但近來若干報販均以步行費時遂攺乘自動車分送一至滬報旣來好駕車分途出發故中山路上每見有多數自動車絶塵而前其快無比至報販本人則均携有皮袋内實各種報紙或在車後捆載如此一轉移間城内居民变得於五時前讀報矣</p>
<p>以余所知報販中之最年老者有一許姓據彼自述於三十餘歲送報迄今年逾五旬仍未輟業此老精神頗佳步行甚健尤難能者即風雨交加亦從未託人代送且亦絶不誤時彼嘗謂余向其定報之人家十年如一出未聞有不滿意之語非若少年報販動輒失信也倚老賣老斯殆可稱首都報販中之老資格者矣</p>
<p>報販尙有一種副業即搜購舊報紙轉售以取利大約一斤報紙經其手可獲五分至一角之贏餘又據某報販言自由談或快活林一個月中完全無缺可得代價銀幣一元若然則報販之收入固甚可觀也</p>
<h3>聨歡小記小綺</h3>

<p>阿爾喬生表演中主席突以英語介紹謂今日特請美國之阿爾喬生先生來此奏曲先生即爲最著名「可歌可泣」片中之主角云云一時觀衆大奇未幾阿爾喬生來登台面塗黑脂作可歌可泣片中表演之一段備極哀婉聽者莫不感動旣畢記者趨前叩訽乃知此阿爾喬生先生實該級同學陳振鉎君所喬裝亦云神矣</p>
<p>老板放歌阿爾喬生表演畢繼之者有黄老板之清唱黄老板者記者亦不詳其名憔以其擅長老生遂有老板之名</p>

<h3>中國銀行十八年報告</h3>
<p>中國銀行自成立以來迄今有八載自民國十七年十月新條例頒布以後遵即變更業務方針趨重于國内外匯兌以扶助國内外貿易之發展期無負國家之付託社會之屬望一年以來粗具規模惟值此新舊方針遞嬗之秋試一回顧十八年來之經過其間損益興革應付艱難有足述者爰撮要言之如次以爲鑒往知來之助幸垂鑒焉</p>
<p>（一）中國銀行之成立及承還大清銀行商股商存欵項中國銀行係由大清銀行遞嬗而來當辛亥革命告成後大清銀行商股聨合會呈准南京臨時政府就前上海大清銀行舊址攺設中國銀行并設分行于南京迨四月南北統一中央政府命令設立中國銀行籌備處于北京以謀組織完備之國家銀行二年四月參議院公布中國銀行當開業之始僅由政府撥到墊付股欵洋二百九十三萬零五百八十七元中國銀行以如是極微之股本而能逐漸滋長發達以至於今日其所以能博得社會之信用樹立銀行之基礎其間有一事不可不紀者即承還大清銀行商股商存是查大清銀行商股共庫平銀五百萬两歸中國銀行換給存單分四年還清給息五厘又大清銀行存欵銀六百七十餘萬两亦由中國銀行分年攤還其在二千两以下者一年還清二千两以上者三年還清此項墊付之欵再由政府陸續撥還當時中國銀胻雖明知本身能力薄弱而敢毅然担任代還者一方面固依賴政府之威信一方面則認清維持信用爲銀行生存之基礎故不惜負此重責而本行因此得於産生之初即以辦理銀行之基本思想印人於行員腦筋之中俾行員時時警惕於信用之維持其有裨於中國銀行之發展實非淺鮮也</p>
<p>（二）中國銀行履行國家銀行職務民國二年四月財政部設立國稅廳籌備處統一全國國稅頒定金庫章程委託中國銀行掌理總金庫及全國分支金庫冀漸收金庫統一之效於是中國銀行即積極籌備接收各省金庫或設分行或託官銀號代理一面派員赴日調查日本銀行經理國庫辦法至四年底各省金庫巳由中國銀行接收者計直隸·江蘇·浙江·山東·山西·安徽·江西·福建·廣東·奉天黑龍江·四川·貴州·歸綏等十五省本行全年經收之欵約有一萬二三千萬元正與今日國民政府國庫收入除關稅以外之數目不相上下此爲國民財政史上最可注意之時期惟中國銀行雖因受政府命令努力於金庫之接收而各省官廳均以中國銀行在青黄不接時必須墊供欵項爲條件至今各省分行之官廳積欠墊欵中有六七百萬元皆因此發生其次則恊助中央整理幣制亦爲中國銀行當時所負之重要任務蓋當時各省官銀錢號濫發紙幣幣制紊亂流毒甚烈尤以廣東江西東三省之紙幣跌價最甚廣東發行之紙幣約三千萬元定價五折由政府撥欵收回不足之數由中國銀行墊補計共墊洋一百三十八萬零二百餘元江西發行之錢票八百萬串由中國銀行借欵二百萬元定價收回嗣以此欵不敷因發行幣制公債四百萬元責令中國銀行承售計先後共墊洋三百六十萬元吉林發行之官帖本定由中央地方會同備欵交中國銀行以中國銀行兌換劵收回其後中途停輟計墊大洋一百六十七萬五千三百餘元以上三項中國銀行作墊之數約共六百六十五萬五千五百餘元同時於現幣方面中國銀行上海分行復襄助政府將墨洋及其他各色銀元收回攺鑄國幣由本行與錢業公所恊定自民國四年八月一日起所有龍洋行市一律取消每日只開新幣行市惟江南湖北廣東及大清銀幣四種銀元均按照新幣行市通用其他各種銀幣均得向中交兌換新幣每日以二萬元爲席當時雖無精確數字之記錄而歷年逐漸收換之數總計當在二三千萬以上遂使雜幣驅除逐年减少今日國幣之基礎實基於此設令此種整理政策能於此十數年間繼續進行則今日中國之幣制必巳煥然攺觀而中國銀行因職責所在所犧牲之鉅資亦不至擲於虚牝此固本行所引爲遺憾抑亦中國幣制史上最可痛心之事也</p>
<p>（三）民五停兌令與中國銀行之重大攺革當國家財政金融與中國銀行營業信用蒸蒸日上之時忽有洪憲帝制之政變發生南北軍興以致五年五月停兌之令股東諸君必尙記憶上海中國銀行首先反對命令照常兌現此舉實樹今日推廣發行之基礎而北方各中國銀行因近在政府勢力範圍以内不得不受迫停兌其結果政府以爲紙幣旣不兌現可以任意取借在此威脅之下雖設法婉拒然至五年十日止發行額竟有六千餘萬之鉅其後此六千餘萬不兌現紙幣之整理半由政府發行公債半由本行自籌資金其間因應補苴費十年之力直至民國十六年始首尾清結論國家論銀行其受損失固不待言而他日談中國幣制者此實一不可忘之事實唯中國銀行因此而得三大覺悟第一發行銀行不可不求業務上之獨立因於六年十一月呈准政府修攺則例總裁副總裁本由政府簡任攺爲由股東總會選出之董事中任命同時確定股本先招足一千萬元官商各半俾股東總會爲本行之最高機關此十餘年來政變頻仍而中行得維持獨立之精神不受政潮之波盪者實受民國六年則例之賜而有以奠定其基礎也第二各地分行應維持其相當之獨立蓋因民五停兌之敎訓始覺以中國幅員之大在政治未統一以前若欲求銀行業務之完全統一與集中不特因一地之變動波及全體抑且使當地人民有以甲地資金供給乙地之懷疑在在足以摇動人民之信仰故不如使各地分行維持相當之獨立各以各地社會之利益爲前提並首先將分行發行之紙幣式樣顔色完全區别兌換準備金亦各自獨立如天津分行曾於民國十年十一月三十日聘英國會計師司培門查核帳目點騐庫存並邀請官廳商會及銀行錢業两公會到行公開檢查準備又如上海分行因各行莊領用本劵曾於十三年五月四日公開準備邀請各行莊到行檢視查核至上海分行本身發行兌換劵於十七年三月二十九日陳部核准設立發行準備檢查委員會每月公開檢查一次凡此皆所以取信於當地人民而在在求盡服務社會之職志是以民十以後連年皖直戰爭奉直戰爭南北戰爭以及民國十六年武漢政府停兌漢劵之舉各地分行未受影響未始不由於此第三營業方針不可不側重於商業方面民五以後國家統一旣經破壞統一財政統一幣制之舉巳屬絶望故中國銀行之營業方針不能不及早變更由政府方面轉移於商業方面類於紙幣之發行不以金庫支出爲主而以購買或貼現商業期票爲主顧客之招徠不趨重於官廳之存貸而注意於商民之往來因上項覺悟之結果謀漸進攺革之實施溯自民五以來發行銀行逐漸增加各行存欵攬收甚力然以最近報告（十七年終）全國發行各銀行發行總額約爲二萬九千五百萬元（不兌現紙幣除外）中國銀行發行總數占全體百分之五十八存欵數目在全體各銀行總數九萬八千三百二十餘萬元中亦占百分之三十九當創鉅痛深之餘幸能博得如是之成績此本行所引爲自慰著也</p>

<h3>徐佩琨金貴銀賤救濟方案（續）</h3>
<p>禁止外國銀行發行紙幣</p>
<p>禁止外國銀行發行紙幣提案雖亦救濟時艱之策但可列人我國幣制整頓計劃之中</p>
<p>（三）國内和平與秩序之恢復及工商事業之發展國内和平與秩序之恢復以及運輸機關之通利確能臻國家經濟於穩固而使上海剩餘現銀流人内地内地現銀之需求當可稍微鞏固滬埠銀匯但若以其效果與外國現銀之入口及標金交易所之投機等之勢力相較則又微乎其微矣中國舉國工商業發達需銀自多結果亦能使上海銀匯趨於穩定但此端迹近夢想蓋非待其見之實現絶不發生任何影響何補於今日之風潮哉</p>
<p>（四）增廣生銀之用途</p>
<p>另有一派議論别具見解主張以增廣生銀之用途爲保持銀匯之法其主要論點爲强迫紙幣之發行須具有十足現銀準備及鼓　銀洋及硬輔幣之二端第一端之困難爲變更中國不健全金融制度上銀行界歷來根深蒂固之習慣與心理事屬難能第二端之困難在政府實施之時費用過鉅而且銀幣與硬輔幣流通之需要暫時亦未必有若何之增多雖然以上二法設能完全見之實行則於銀匯上當有善果所惜此類救濟方策自目下匯兌紛擾原因上觀之尙非主要之辦法耳</p>
<p>（五）設立中外匯兌銀行</p>
<p>中央匯兌銀行又一性質全異之建議即爲創設一中央匯兌銀行此行著者認爲在實行救濟方策時應有之機關但該行本身不能即視爲救濟之方策</p>
<p>（六）推廣國外貿易</p>
<p>促進出口貿易及减少進口貿易等建議能增廣銀匯之需求及减少金幣之需求故亦能臻銀匯於穩定然此類補救辨法雖屬可靠但若以之與其他影響我國銀價之勢力相較則又太弱而且糾正國際貿易之差額非短時期内所可希望成功者對於此次需要急救金融風潮仍屬無補　　（七）禁正現金出口</p>
<p>現金出口禁令現金出口禁令者一方所以抵制外來現銀之傾注藉中國爲尾閭而又將中國之現金搜買以去又一方所以抑低標金交易所内標金之價格而使銀價之臻於堅挺也</p>
<p>（八）禁止現銀進口</p>
<p>現銀進口禁令一旦頒行亦即能提高銀價而抑低金價在禁令施行期内此令須嚴格奉行如遇不需用此令時可及時撤消之</p>
<p>（九）生銀進口徵稅</p>
<p>若嫌完全禁止現銀進口爲不易行則以徵收現銀進口稅替代現銀進口禁变令亦屬權宜辦法且事實上較爲易行此項稅率之高度應以足敷補賣銀價之再跌爲衡經一定之實行時間以後（例如一年）其稅率應按當時情形重行修訂依著者意見值百抽五十之現銀進口稅並非過高至少限度亦當定爲值百抽三十以上三端統爲最有效力之救濟辦法不拘何法皆能獲得完善效果惟三法實施以後應絶對遵守情形變動時亦應隨時修訂爲求此項目的之實現起見更應有一管理局之創設該局由政府官員商界份子及經濟者共同組織之並賦與無限制的權力以管轄金銀之出口入口隨時修訂現銀進口稅則及監督一切有關係之事務</p>
<p>（十）取締金業交易所賭博性之投機及標金投機籲稅</p>
<p>又因標金交易所爲影響上海銀匯變動之總樞紐故該所之應如何對付亦屬一重要問題在未詳察該所工作上之經濟功用以前對於該所之是否應當存在未便遽加斷言但自該所作交易上之性質及全球各主要金融中心交易所歷來之經騐上而觀則標金交易之應受官廳的或半官的管理機關所管轄實屬正當之圖交易所内之員司應負責按日供給關於標金幣買賣上之紀錄及一切消息如標金成交之數目及其各項價格是操縱壟斷或賭博應在絶對禁止之例如有違犯者應嚴加處罰或拘禁或二者並用每次成交標金須徵收稅金其成交數目在一定數目（例如七百條）以上時應按照確定之累進稅率徵稅之買賣合同展期或拖延應加限制並徵稅之此外關於减少賭博性的買賣及保護合乎經濟原理的投機之種種方法均應計議切實施行</p>
<p>（戊）結論生銀進口徵稅及制止標金賭博可保全數百萬生靈之幸福</p>
<p>總之此次上海之兌匯風潮自有其原因與結果與外國兌匯風潮之自有其原因與結果者初無異致影響我國銀匯之原因上文業巳述明初學者固無從而知其奥也至於此次匯兌風潮所生影響之巳經感覺者有多項物價之高漲及諸重要巨商之破産等端然此後患難之起方與未艾而且爲禍尤烈當風潮之初起也國人若不介意因之醖釀之期從而延長如果任其變化不加制止則我國對外貿易即將全部破壞而全國經濟生命之源泉亦將於焉告絶而引起大禍之降臨矣在任何國内當其匯兌風潮初起即當迅加診察並加對付各國所肜之補救辦法實際皆與上述各端相同故此處所論並非無稽之談持之即可以得完美結果者也國民政府在匯兌風潮初起之時即聲稱禁止標金價格之飛漲並禁止外國銀幣之進口以及國内標金之出口其對付時事似極敏捷著者對於其第一項辦法雖以其不易實施且跡近武斷未表贊同但對此整個及時救濟之策固馨香祝禱冀其早日實施俾殘局得轉危爲安寗非數百萬生靈之幸福哉但時至今日我人除日聞謡傅以外不聞其他政府之無定策適與公衆以不安及投機之機且自風潮初起以至今日爲時不可謂短政府對於本問題之討論爲時亦不可謂不足方今政府主要之職責厥惟積極實施上列提議以冀保障目今混擾期内全國人民之利益夫徵收現銀進口稅再益之以標金交易所之規定旣爲一更實際之補救方法推而行之足以迅收攺進一海銀匯之效當局又安得而忽視之哉（完）</p>

<h3>英海峽隧道問題報告内容</h3>
<p>工程上地質上無問題經濟上大體於英有利可用工人七千餘需費三千萬金鎊</p>
<p>關於英吉利海峽開築隧道問題法國輿論昨巳介紹一斑茲將英國委員會之報告内容略述如左</p>
<p>此問題之存在於英國輿論界巳逾八十年反對之理由甚多其最有力者爲一種感情的理由蓋英國本爲島國故向來視其地理上之隔離爲一種國防屏翰但大戰以後此項態度即大攺變則以飛機之發展巳無國境可以限隔也此爲軍事上見解之變更而在經濟上亦有攺變輿論之要因英國戰後失業者衆其朝野上下咸覺開築隧道之計畫者實現可用不少工人以解决一部分之失業問題而對歐陸之商業亦可望大爲發展</p>
<p>迨去年四月五號前總理包爾温氏舉出一委員會其職務爲「對於海峽隧道建築或其他横斷海峽交通方法之提議之經濟的方面從事審查及報告」觀此規定有可注意者即除經濟的一項外其他各方面概置不提質言之蓋巳不成問題矣</p>
<p>該委員會審查至一年之久近巳發表報告書委員五名中四員贊成開築隧道之議據彼等所信開築隧道之結果雖有若干利益或將受不利影響而在大體上英國將得經濟上利益另一委員則簽字於報告書之大部分而不贊同四委員之結論據彼意開築隧道事屬可能但就經濟上觀察未必有利云</p>
<p>委員會所徵得之各方面證言紛雜不一極耐尋味英國南部之農人社會慮隧道開後妨碍彼之農業（委員會認此項懸慮爲無根據）各地商會則大體皆贊成開築隧道製造家則恐結果將奬勵外貨之輸入航業公司則對此計畫簡直大起恐慌竭力反對</p>
<p>委員會歸納各方面之不同意見决定若干之主要結論即横斷海峽交通其方法雖有種種而比較研究似無逾於開築隧道者就種種證據觀察物質上及工程上之困難均不足慮但於消除一切疑念之先必須先開一「嚮導」隧道其費需五百六十萬鎊</p>
<p>此「嚮導」隧道一經造成則繼續建造雙線之鐵路隧道可無問題鐵路之運轉及維持亦無困難此雙線隧道開築費預算約二千五百萬鎊其工程宜全由私人企業團體任之政府不予以任何補助如此可使造費省儉將來鐵路開通後所收運費可不逾於目下汽船所收之率</p>
<p>至開築計畫提出者有两種委員會贊成「海峽隧道公司」所提之一種其内容爲造一隧道長三十六哩其中二十四哩確實開於海峽之底其餘十二哩則連接两面沿海岸之隧導據該公司預算「嚮導」隧道可以两年半開成雙線鐵路隧道更需四年半两項造費如上所述共約三千萬鎊</p>
<p>報告書中關於雇用工人之一節與失業問題有關最爲重要據各顧問工程師計算在「嚮導」隧道之五年工事中直接間接可用工人一千名在鐵路隧道之三年工專中可直接間接用工人六千零五十名對此各航業公司方面員工失業者當有三千名强但此乃隧道工程完成後之事而隧道完成後尙有關係之新工作可以重新吸收失業者</p>
<p>報告書之發表並未使此問題得切實解决而英當局可藉此於實際上繼續考慮蓋於此問題之解决巳更進一步云</p>

<h3>百年後世界人口的預測</h3>
<p>昌溪</p>
<p>歐洲人口過剩的危機</p>
<p>在世界上許多國家中都感着人滿之患在移民殖民的政策上發生了國際間的爭鬥歐洲的國家中除了法蘭西以外其他的國家都對於現代的生産率發生恐怖他們認爲照現在的生産率繼百年之久認爲在地道下的人口也要與任何城區一樣</p>
<p>因此德意志的林格克（WolfganyvouLengerhe）把歐洲人口過剩的危機加以系統的研究他在李卜諾城的三ustrirteZeitung上說「一個人對於歐洲人口的過剩不能糢糊的恐怖而應在事實上作一種考察然後對於將來作科學的推測世界現今的人口總數巳激增爲十九億五百萬萬歐洲共六百二十五萬萬平均每九萬人佔一平方基羅米突美洲一百二十七萬萬平均每五十二萬佔一平方基羅米突亞洲一億零三十萬萬平均四十三萬人佔一平方基羅米突非洲一百四十萬萬平均每三十萬人佔一平方基羅米突澳洲八萬萬平均每八萬人佔一平平基羅米突從這個大約的統計亞洲有她廣大的土地可以容納她的人民</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>中華民國十九年五月</p>
<p>美洲和非洲和澳洲也儘有容納的可能而歐洲的地域在比較上說是居於世界人口總數的第二位再依着每洲的比例來說歐洲現巳有人口六百二十五萬萬地位上至多只能容納到一億五百萬萬然而美洲却以一百四十七萬對三億三百萬萬亞洲以一億零三十萬萬一億七百萬萬非洲以一百四十萬萬對二億三百萬澳洲以八萬萬對七百萬萬但是歐洲幾乎加增了六百七十五萬萬在百年第的歐洲是没有居居住的地位了</p>
<p>但是這種人口過剩的危險雖然對於將來政治上的變化與否有關係但是在百年後是必有的事實歐洲的列强個個在兢兢於殖民地的發展其實他們對人口過剩的根本問題没有注意在他們的極力向外發展中仍然不能防止歐洲人口的剩以前英國曾以美洲爲殖民地而法蘭西荷蘭都向美洲移民實際上只有造成人類戰爭並不能防止人口的不過剩道種劇大的問題不知將來要如何解决那須得學者們的研究了我願我的話不是一種狂論值得人們來加以進一步的研究</p>
<p>他道議論發表後很引起全歐洲的注意在現今列强正注意亞洲殖民的聲浪道種本著科學精神的預測是不無理由的</p>
<h3>全澳澳洲人口最近統計</h3>
<p>據澳洲聨邦統計家調查發表全澳洲人口在一九二九年九月三十號共計六百三十九萬一千三百六十三名是年由出生超過死亡之自然增加爲六萬九千零二十三入境者超過出境者之數爲一萬一千八百八十結果凈增八萬零九百十一人云</p>
<h3>東報紀中國養蠶狀况</h3>

<p>畢竟天也不是有意和我們爲難的不信你看呢還没有到南翔雨便住了等到我們下了車子在南翔道上走的時候太陽巳照耀在空中了泥路上的積水浴後的芳草走在上面令人生無限的快感所以這樣長的一段到王園的泥路絲毫没有給我們一些疲倦我們終於站在和靄的園主之前了</p>
<p>俯身在淺水灘上的游艇對於我們是莫大的引誘一灣靜悄悄的綠水夾着两岸的是青葱樹木雨後格外濃翠了我們頓時會會幻想到放着小艇浮在這澄清的水上的樂趣没有一刻鐘的休息我們便分坐上四隻小艇浮在水面上了</p>
<p>膽小的終於被好奇心所克服雖則說在水面上頑是危險的事可是年青所人怕什麽幸運的和會摇的坐在一船一會兒便摇出港口去了不幸一船都是不十分會摇小艇便不十分用命底東西飄泊着吻過了東邊的泥岸又去吻西邊的於是四隻小艇便分散在這一涨綠水中　　小艇出了口競爭便開始了小漿一起一落底撥着綠波有秩序而有節奏水面上的笑渦隨着船送我們前進歌聲笑聲流散在河面上驚散了水裏的游魚和岸上的黄鶯在後面的追逐着在前面的在前面的嘲笑着後面的被嘲笑的撥着水攻擊嘲笑的嘲笑的却鼓着小漿逃去這樣的喧聲驚醒了沈寂睡去的小溪</p>
<p>低拂水面的柳葉隨着輕快的風飄蕩着摇得太快的小艇一時避不開去便穿入絲絲的垂柳底下去了像會中的彩帶一樣罩滿了小舟從空隙裏大家張望着模糊得像在霧中了於是便借着柳蔭憩息着分食着帶來的糖果遠遠聽得船夫曲的歌聲知道是有船來了高聲的招呼着將糖果抛了過去抛不到的落在水裏没有接到的悵望着漸漸沈卞去的糖果於是抛的又狂笑了</p>
<p>船轉两個灣便看見一架平橋橋是可以抽起來的两隻白鵝在橋下緩緩的游着岸上一叢薔薇正盛開着映在水裏的一叢却被浪花濺碎了零亂的花片兒平舖在水面上也順着水浪讓了開去不肯飄近我們鵝呢看見我們是逃了</p>
<p>暮色漸漸深沈起來快逝去的夕陽瀝過了林木洒在河面上溪水分外陰綠起來两岸的樹木也格外蒼翠了小艇相遇的時候大家問上岸去否可是誰也没有上去這一刹那的夕陽終於消失在蒼茫的暮色中這可留戀的游艇終於不得不和我們相别到我們大家一齊摇近岸的時候祇聽到歌聲不看見船身了　　這送春的遠足又如夢底過去了從此將給我們以不少渺然的回憶然而這畢竟是值得回憶的因爲在那裏全是眞情的流露所以要唱就唱要笑就笑全是天性的表現没有虚僞也没有戲劇式的做作我覺得祇有這個才是我們人生的眞意</p>
<h3>膠州路上音樂聲</h3>
<p>洙泗上絃歌地亦羶腥隔水氈鄉落日牛羊下區脫縱横看名王宵獵騎火一川明笳鼓悲鳴遠人驚念腰間箭匣中劍空埃蠧竟何成···聞道中原遺老常南望翠葆霓旌使行人到此忠憤氣塡膺有涙如傾　　張孝祥六州歌頭</p>
<p>初到D大學的貴胄公子公主們在春睡朦朧底甜蜜香夢中醒過來的時候常聽到一種從西方傅來沁人心靈的音樂這種音樂有急促的情調可以和心絃諧合這種音樂有裴太芬感動維也納男子的魄力來感動公子和公主們的春思更有拉西爾的馬賽爾鼓起法國革命志士熱血的强力來鼓起公子和公主們的熱血這是多麽微妙與偉大使幸福的公子和公主們聽到這樣的音樂</p>
<p>不過公子和公主始終是醒着的</p>
<p>有時候公子和公主的情緒上起了變化也會對這種音樂起了一種憎惡的態度公子的心底起了煩悶便很憤怒說了「這種音樂愈奏得起勁我的心裏愈覺得難過」公主當然也委聰明聽覺並不比公子壞些所以聽到了不免有些愠意當她們在宮道上行走的當兒一步一步正像一針一針刺入她們柔弱的心底不過她們或者没有表示祇有内心是明白的</p>
<p>有一天公子與公主碰見在一起便談起這事情</p>
<p>公子說「我記得楚覇王聽見四面楚歌便自刎於烏江這好像楚覇不死於自身勇氣的缺乏却死於癱瘓人心的音樂」　　公主說「這也不盡然虞姬一曲項王的勇氣不是蠢然而動嗎」</p>
<p>公子說「話固是如此所以音樂確是動人的假使一個人被一種最易激奮情感的音樂剌在心底而毫無表示這人未免太麻木」</p>
<p>公主說「音樂不動人就算麻木我不信這話」</p>
<p>公子說「如果我們宮中發見了異國的情調奏着唱着這不是和我們宮中有許多外來的在吵架相駡一樣嗎」</p>
<p>公主說是啊但是我們耳膜没有拒絶聽異國情調的能力呢」</p>
<p>公子說「不過漢武帝被困於匃奴的時候天天聽見匃奴的肉笳奏鳴武帝對之毫無辦法這種情形武帝心中不免有些難堪現在我們憑欄靜朎膠州音其情况也不下於當時罷</p>
<p>公子說了長嘆一聲公主也惘然了過了幾天公子和公主在宮道上看見了許多異國的黄狼在宮中竄來竄去兇猛非凡公子和公主對之竟無辦法一時也不敢阻止深恐阻止不成反被噬傷小不愼則亂大謀公子和公主都受過父老的敎訓過的個個都很明白所以祇得按住他們的熱血靜待着靜待着</p>
<p>公子和公子天天看見噬人的黄狼和刺人的音樂因爲守着敎訓靜着靜着所以他們内心的血涙祇得在内心中流來流去</p>
<p>後來公子和公主們聽見不久可以移宮了他們心中非常高興因爲可以看不見黄狼聽不見音樂了</p>
<p>但是有人說「這條宮道上公子公主雖是搬了但是始終有人住着的所以這種黄狼這種音樂也始終有人看見的聽見的或者其感覺没有像公子和公主這樣快同時反而認爲好看好聽的也說不定　　所以預言家這樣說「這種黄黄狼和音樂在這條路上這幾年之内不發生問題一定能夠很安穩的竄着唱着</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The US Naval Faction and the Treaty</h3>
<p>When the London Conference closed, journalists were concerned that the benefits of arms reduction would not be seen, but internal disputes would arise first. This was because the positions of various countries at this conference were not entirely consistent. The diplomatic faction had to take into account the international diplomatic situation, the financial faction had to take into account the domestic financial situation, while the naval faction only cared about national defense and ignored everything else. As a result, conflicts often arose between the three factions. The intense debate in the US Senate over the naval faction's efforts to block the ratification of the treaty is one example. The so-called new naval policy advocated by the US naval faction has been around for a long time. The so-called new naval policy is the naval expansion shipbuilding plan that has attracted worldwide attention and costs 274 million gold yuan. Although the case was slightly remedied by President Coolidge's proposal to eliminate the shipbuilding deadline after fierce debates between the two factions in the Senate in 1927, it was almost entirely passed due to the naval faction's fierce movement, which shows the strength of the US naval faction. Since the United States passed this huge shipbuilding plan, the navies of various countries have been affected and have risen up to compete in shipbuilding. At that time, the United States vigorously advocated peace while expanding its navy. Therefore, it was expected that the next naval conference prepared by the Washington Conference would have no hope of opening, but unexpectedly, the naval conference that was not expected actually took place in London, which is really unexpected. However, the ambition of the US naval faction has not ended. Although the shipbuilding plan proposed this time is not as large as the shipbuilding plan proposed before the meeting, it is eager to seek sufficient quantity equal to that of the UK, and is eager to plan to prevent the passage of the treaty in the parliament. Is there any difference between the opening and not opening of the London Conference?</p>
<p>Today, there are certainly more than just one country that is dissatisfied with the naval treaty. There are also more than just the United States that are eagerly discussing and carrying out shipbuilding plans. However, the navies of various countries are following the lead of the US navy, and the US naval faction is like this. Is this the original intention of advocating peace?</p>

<h3>Great Chaos in the Japanese House of Representatives</h3>
<p>Koashi Requests Questioning on the Agenda, Government's Response Hits the Mark, Opposition Party Stages a Full-Scale Physical Fight, Yada Tanaka Narrowly Escapes Being Beaten</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Electric News) - The government's resolution to question the Kyoashi Affair, which was brought up by Yukio Ozaki of the Seiyu Club, was put on the agenda at yesterday's Plenary Session of the House of Representatives. At the beginning, Mr. Ozaki explained the reasons for the proposal. The Minseito Party tried to obstruct him in various ways. During the questioning, Tanaka Yada (Minseito) said that Mr. Ozaki's claim that this case was the same as the Okuma Cabinet's Oura Affair at the time was actually that the Oura Affair occurred during that cabinet's era, while this one started during the previous cabinet's era and was a scandal unrelated to the current cabinet. First, he defended the government and then retorted to Mr. Ozaki whether he had forced Prime Minister Okuma to resign during the Oura Affair. Next, he turned his attack to the Seiyukai, saying that although the Seiyukai was ecstatic about the Kyoashi Affair and wanted to make it an issue, it did not know that the elder of the Seiyukai, Takejiro Tokonami, was also jointly responsible with Mr. Kyoashi, and Mr. Kyoashi was the Secretary-General of the Seiyukai Headquarters under Mr. Tokonami. His words hit the Seiyukai hard, and all the members of the Seiyukai clamored and stood up. Dozens of veterans such as Fujii, Aoka, Tsugumo, and Sakamoto rushed to the stage to punch Tanaka, but were eventually blocked by the guard corps led by the Chief of Guard of the Imperial Palace, and could not use force. They then wrestled with the guards, turning into a chaotic fight. Tanaka was guarded by another guard team and lowered the stage to avoid being beaten. Then, Ozaki took the stage again to answer Mr. Tanaka's question, saying that he had indeed made a suggestion to Prime Minister Okuma at the time of the Oura Affair, although he had no direct responsibility, but he had to bear the responsibility for inadequate supervision. At this time, the Seiyukai's noise became even louder, and Secretary-General Mori raised his voice and suppressed the audience, and the turmoil in the Diet reached an uncontrollable level. Mr. Ozaki's resolution was eventually obscured by the noise of punishing ten Seiyukai members, and the outcome could not be decided and adjourned. The deliberation of this resolution will be left to the last day of this session of the Diet, that is, the plenary session on the 13th. It is expected that there will be another big chaos in the Diet on that day. The House of Representatives has decided to borrow guards from the House of Peers to be prepared.</p>
<h3>India's No-Tax Movement</h3>
<p>Gradually Takes Definite Form, Gandhi's Successor Prepares to Occupy Salt Factory, Muslim Sacrifice Festival Passes Peacefully in Various Places</p>
<p>Bombay, 10th (Reuters) - The no-tax movement advocated by Vithalbhai Patel, former Speaker of the Indian Legislative Assembly, is gradually taking definite form in Gujarat. According to a telegram from Bardoli, MP Dai Shers has been elected as the commander in Kaira to consider the no-tax issue. Thirty-five towns in the region have now decided not to pay land tax. Other villages have either paid land tax or have not yet paid taxes. Gandhi promoted the no-tax movement in Kaira in 1921 and 1922.</p>
<p>Jalalpore, 11th (Reuters) - Gandhi's successor, Abbas Tyabji, will lead Gandhi's volunteers from Karadi to Dharasana tomorrow to occupy the salt factory and, according to Gandhi's instructions, invite the female poet Sarojini Naidu to serve as the commander of the volunteers after he is arrested. Mrs. Naidu went to Bombay today to summon more volunteers to Dharasana. It is heard that the authorities have built iron wire around the Dharasana salt factory to prevent it from being occupied.</p>
<p>Shimla, 11th (Reuters) - According to reports from Delhi, Allahabad, Meerut, Bombay, and Calcutta, yesterday's Muslim Sacrifice Festival passed peacefully. Muslims slaughter cattle on this day to worship heaven and entertain the public, while Hindus regard cattle as sacred. However, last night, some people in Sholapur attacked the police station, took police uniforms and equipment, and set them on fire. When the police arrived, the crowd had dispersed.</p>
<p>Shimla, 11th (Reuters) - Non-violent resistance volunteers announced today that they plan to gather in a certain place to manufacture prohibited salt. Five people were arrested and the rest were dispersed by the fire brigade with water hoses after warnings.</p>
<p>North Xiawa, 11th (Reuters) - The authorities claim that 39 people have been arrested so far, including 10 thugs, 14 National Congress workers, and 13 Youth Association members.</p>
<h3>Countries Prepare for Poison Gas Warfare</h3>
<p>Military Chemical Research Is Becoming More Refined, and the Use of Poison Gas Is Increasing</p>
<p>Fudan News Agency said that although the history of chemical warfare is only a little more than ten years, the enthusiasm for research and the number of inventions by various countries are shocking. Although the Hague Peace Conference explicitly prohibited warring countries from using poison gas in 1899, they each sought their own interests when the European War broke out, and the use of poison gas increased. Therefore, the Hague Treaty is just a piece of paper. The following is a general investigation of the preparations of various countries for poison gas warfare:</p>
<p>(1) Germany was the first country to use poison gas and is also the most prepared for it. Everyone knows that Germany's dye industry is the most developed. Dye factories can be converted into poison gas manufacturing plants within 24 hours. As for research work, it is concentrated in various universities and the Institute of Physical Chemistry in Berlin. During the Great War, only the Bayer Dye Factory produced the following kinds of poison gas: 4,800 tons of mustard gas, 12,000 tons of tri-formic acid, 500 tons of brominated octo-carbon, 810 tons of activated carbon, and 6,000 tons of bitter grass.</p>
<p>There are many other factories with the same amount of effectiveness as Bayer, such as the BASF Dye Factory, the Kora Factory, and the Muster Factory.</p>
<p>(2) The United States has the organization of the Chemical Warfare Service Bureau. The bureau is divided into research, manufacturing, defense, medical and other departments. The number of personnel in each department totaled 4,066 at the end of the Great War. From June 1, 1917 to June 1, 1918, the research department alone spent US$2.5 million. In addition, there is a military chemical school in the Edge Wood Arsenal. Universities that have established military chemical specialties include the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Michigan, and the University of South Dakota. The Edge Wood Arsenal alone produced the following poison gases in one month of November 1918: 30 tons of tetrachloride, 90 tons of tin tetrachloride, 100 tons of white phosphorus, 90 tons of bromide, 900 tons of mustard gas, 1,050 tons of phosgene, 1,500 tons of bitter grass, and 2,400 tons of green gas. (3) Since 1922, all chemists in France have been registered with the Ministry of Military Affairs so that they can be dispatched at any time. In 1924, a military chemical training institute was established, headed by the famous chemist Professor Moore. During the Great War, France produced the following poison gases: 2,400 tons of green gas, 16,000 tons of phosgene, 4,000 tons of Fisner gas, 500 tons of bitter grass, 4,000 tons of tin tetrachloride, 2,700 tons of arsenic dichloride, and 200 tons of tetrachloride.</p>
<p>(4) The United Kingdom has a Military Chemical Committee, and the Ministry of War has a Chemical Department. There are currently more than 150 employees in the department. The expenditure in 1925 was 273,000 pounds. The recent expenditure should be more than that. Various universities and scientific institutions are working hard to research. The general agency is located in Boehringer Ingelheim.</p>
<p>(5) Japan's finances have been reported to be at an extreme point in recent years, but because of the importance of national defense chemistry, it is exempted from taking out 5 million Japanese dollars from the national treasury to establish a Chemical Warfare Research Institute.</p>
<p>(6) All of Russia's poison gas factories are located in the following places: Moscow, Kiev, Kochkosmolensk, Siberia, and Irkutsk. The new buildings of public buildings and important institutions have been specially equipped with windows to prevent poison gas. The training class for military chemistry has stepped up its work. It was reported two weeks ago that the Russian government had ordered all female party members in the country to practice the use of anti-poison gas equipment.</p>
<p>Other countries such as Czechoslovakia (Olomouc), Poland (Warsaw), and Spain (Chengfeinando and San Moding) all have military chemical schools.</p>
<p>All countries are actively preparing for war and are keeping it secret. The above is all about the wartime situation, but the intensity of its progress and the precision of its research are now even better than in the past. We must not only pay attention to the regulations on the number of troops and the number of warships, but also observe the number of its dye factories, fertilizer plants, and gas condensation plants, as well as the content of other chemical laboratories and scientific research institutes, in order to know the country's war strength.</p>

<h3>The Misfortune of the London Naval Treaty in the U.S. Senate</h3>
<p>The Big Navy Faction Is Ending Preparations to Approve the Bill, and the Result Will Be Postponed Until Next Year</p>
<p>Washington Dispatch: It has become a fact that the London Naval Treaty will face fierce opposition in the U.S. Senate. The Big Navy faction is preparing for battle, and its first move will focus on preventing rapid discussion of the case in the Senate. If the White House urgently seeks approval, as the Harding administration did for the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922, it will inevitably be rejected. According to the Senate opposition's plan, the London Naval Treaties will likely be postponed for discussion until 1931. Congress has already adjourned on June 1st. Senators who believe that the U.S. "failed" and "sacrificed its navy" in London have requested Secretary of State Stimson to detail his work in London to the relevant committees of the Senate. According to the current situation, there will be protracted debates in both the Foreign Relations and Naval Affairs Committees. If so, the approval process will inevitably have to wait until the next session of Congress in December or even be postponed until next year. According to the opinions of some senators, the London Naval Treaty, even if it does not endanger the U.S., is certainly unfair to the U.S. The so-called equality with Britain is merely empty talk on paper. Not only is Britain's advantage in battleships guaranteed for the next five years, but the U.S. is also satisfied with a small fleet of six-inch gun cruisers. In reality, this small fleet is of no use to the U.S. Furthermore, the number of 10,000-ton eight-inch gun cruisers that the U.S. accepted is also lower than what is necessary. This is especially a miscalculation. In short, it is said that Britain won and the U.S. failed. As for Japan, these senators believe that the U.S. has also suffered the same humiliation. Japan decided to demand 70% of the U.S.'s cruisers, destroyers, and submarines at the London conference, and the U.S. also decided to only allow Japan to have 60%. However, the result is that Japan achieved its goal. In the submarine category, Japan not only occupies 70% of the U.S.'s strength but even occupies 100%, because the Reed-Matsudaira agreement allows Japan to have equality with the U.S. based on a tonnage of 52,700 tons. In short, the debate over the approval of the London Treaty has the potential to trigger a fierce battle between the naval loyalists and the so-called "State Department military personnel" (another name for the Stimson faction). The longer the postponement of approval, the greater the opportunities for the opposition will be. The idea of sacrificing national defense to create a "successful" conference will become increasingly entrenched in public opinion, and the Republican side's criticism will be even more severe than the Democratic side's. The naval advisors and experts in the U.S. delegation to the London conference have become the target of public criticism. One senator claimed that how these people were selected is a question because they do not truly represent the navy's thinking. (World)</p>
<h3>Portugal and Mexico Order Warships from Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from Electric Communication on the 11th: Portugal recently ordered a 2,000-ton destroyer from Japan, and Mexico also ordered four 15,000-ton large special-purpose ships. The Japanese shipbuilding industry is currently experiencing extreme slackness, and there will inevitably be a competition for these orders.</p>
<h3>Singapore Naval Base Project</h3>
<p>Will Inevitably Be Implemented</p>
<p>The Conservative Party Strongly Urges Implementation, and the Labor Cabinet Is Difficult to Abandon</p>
<p>London Dispatch: It is now expected that although the majority of members of the Labor Cabinet personally do not favor proceeding with the construction project of the Singapore naval base, they will not be able to abandon it due to the circumstances. The Morning Post commented on this matter, saying: "The Singapore naval port is a necessity. It does not threaten anyone. Anyone who studies the Pacific issue can easily discover that even without the Four Powers, there must be Three Powers who will feel that the British naval power based on the Singapore project is the greatest force that can maintain peace in the Far East." This can represent the opinions of the Conservative Party and the majority of public opinion. Under such pressure, it will be difficult for the Labor Cabinet to maintain an opposing policy.

The literary world was buzzing after this appointment was announced.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Continued News of Contact Between Xu and Yu [Jiangsu and Henan]</h3>
<p>Sun Dianying's Troops Retreat from Northern Anhui, Shi Yousan's Troops Suffer Losses in Western Shandong, Jin [Shanxi] Troops Have Not Increased, Current Trial Battles Are Not Important, Xuzhou Fast Dispatch: Regarding the military situation between Xu and Yu, according to news from the Railway, the two armies have been in contact since the 8th. Because the enemy's front troops retreated and lacked the protection of armored vehicles, they avoided fighting along the railway line. Therefore, Wan Xuancai's troops bypassed the north side of the railway line and launched an attack on the Central Army's position from the Yucheng direction. However, the Central Army responded with a calm attitude. Today (the 9th), there was continued contact, which was reportedly slightly more intense than yesterday. However, the enemy troops have suffered considerable losses from the Central Army's counterattack. As for the area south of the railway line, because Sun Dianying's troops retreated and Sun sent representatives to Xuzhou to pledge allegiance, there was no contact. A few days ago, the Central Army and the enemy's Yue Xiangru's troops under Sun's command had contact at Feihekou in Northern Anhui. Sun has now ordered Yue to retreat. In Western Shandong, Shi Yousan's army has not made progress after being bombed by Central Army planes and has also suffered heavy losses. According to observations here, the enemy army's advance this time is probably a manifestation of the orders issued after the Yan-Feng meeting. As for the three divisions of Jin troops that have arrived in Lanfeng, they have not been able to increase the front line. The current trial battles are not very important. (9th)</p>
<h3>The Situation of Northern Military Affairs</h3>
<p>Qi Xieyuan Has Already Come Forward, Sun Chuanfang's Attitude Is Unclear</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: After Yan and Feng met in Zhangde, they traveled together to Zhengzhou by train. The northern military situation is gradually developing and constantly changing. Shi Yousan, who is known for his inconsistency, has been promised Shandong territory by Yan. Shi has sent Deng Chongxi and Song Kebin to Dezhou to organize a temporary office of the Shandong Provincial Government, first establishing the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments. However, Yan initially promised the position of Shandong Provincial Chairman to Fu Zuoyi, but later broke his promise due to environmental factors. Although Fu understood, he was still resentful in his heart. A certain division commander in Jiaodong, who was a classmate of Fu, is willing to be his assistant. Fu's ambition to advance arose spontaneously and he has ordered the Second Route Headquarters to prepare to depart and has dug two strong trenches, each 50 to 60 li wide, at Machang and Cangzhou, which have now been completed. Furthermore, the garrison command was handed over by Li Shengda. Since Song Gongguan announced […], it is heard that Fu's military plan is to have the 43rd Division under his command and Li Shengda's 36th Division be responsible for the Jinpu Railway line, with Wang Jingguo's 37th Division as the reserve force. If they win, they will advance; if they lose, they will defend Hebei. Fu recently sent military advisor Zhu Xisan to Liaoning to request that the Northeast Army not cross the [Hai] River and advance. Recently, postal and telecommunications inspections have been very strict. No news of the Southern military situation has been heard. Although the Northern armies are said to number over one million, the troops directly under the command of Yan and Feng are less than 400,000. The two divisions of Fu and Li are indeed outstanding in the Jin army, but their military training is still very immature.</p>
<p>Qi Xieyuan has contributed a lot this time. All of Sun Dianying's current power is due to Qi's efforts. Yan wants to use him to summon everyone and has appointed him as the Jiangbei Pacification Commissioner. Qi established his headquarters on Huangwei Road in Tianjin City on the 4th, announced his assumption of office, and appointed He Enpu as Chief of Staff, Chen Dingyuan as Secretary-General, Zhang Zhizheng as Director of the Finance Department, and Lao Zhichang as Transportation Commander. Qi is scheduled to go to Zhengzhou in the next few days to negotiate everything. It has not yet been decided where the Pacification Commissioner's office will be located.</p>
<p>Sun Chuanfang also came to Tianjin from Dalian on the 4th, attracting much attention, leading to widespread rumors that he would be appointed as the Jiangnan Pacification Commissioner. According to his secretary Zhang Jigao, Sun suffered from severe dampness in Dalian and could not bathe, feeling very painful. The doctor ordered him to move to another place for recuperation. Since his wife was suffering from lung disease in Tianjin, he took a train through Shenyang to Tianjin on the afternoon of the 2nd. He has no thoughts of fame or fortune. In terms of fame, he has served as the commander-in-chief of the Five Provinces Allied Army. In terms of profit, he has enough assets to live comfortably. At this time, it is absolutely impossible to ask him to lead troops to fight for territory. However, it is true that Sun has not forgotten his concern for national affairs. There is no news as of now regarding the rumors that Sun will take office as the Jiangnan Pacification Commissioner. Perhaps the Jin side is making this announcement. Zhang also said that he can be responsible for representing Sun in his remarks. As for whether Sun will meet with Yan and Feng, it has not yet been decided, and Yan and Feng have not sent representatives to meet him. (6th)</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle Between Civilians and Bandits in Jiaoxian</h3>
<p>The Militia Suffered a Major Defeat with Dozens Dead and Injured, Jiaoxian White [Day] Closes the City Gates and Enforces Martial Law</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Jiaoxian has been affected by military affairs for many years, and bandits have sprung up, especially this spring. Li Xiaoqi, a well-known bandit leader in the southern countryside, has gathered hundreds of people and occupied places such as Lizhu, burning, looting, and killing with extreme brutality. The Jiaoxian county magistrate specially united the county's militia to suppress them severely. On the 5th of this month, both sides launched a general attack at Dazhuang. Unexpectedly, the bandits were cunning and took advantage of the heat of the battle to use a unit of bandits disguised as militia to attack the right wing of the militia. The militia was unprepared and surrounded by bandits. The militiamen were panicked and unwilling to fight, and each fled in defeat. The bandit army took advantage of the situation and launched a fierce attack, causing the militia to suffer a major defeat. Xue Zengrui, the militia training leader, was killed on the spot. Xiang Congzhi, the deputy commander of the militia, was also seriously injured and his life or death is unknown. Dozens of militiamen were also killed and injured. The county authorities were quite panicked after receiving the report and urgently convened leaders of various agencies and district chiefs to hold an emergency meeting. It was decided that representatives such as Wang, commissioned jointly by the various agencies and district chiefs, would come to Qingdao on the 6th to go to the Naval Headquarters to request the dispatch of marines to assist in relieving the people's distress. However, the Qingdao office of the Navy did not dare to make a decision without authorization and needed to telegraph Commander Shen Honglie to instruct on the policy before a decision could be made. The representative, unable to obtain the necessary instructions, returned to Jiaoxian by car today (the 8th). Furthermore, a large group of bandits has also been discovered on Longshan Mountain in the southern countryside of Jiaoxian. They have occupied the mountain and ordered the villagers in the surrounding areas to provide supplies. Those who do not comply will have their villages slaughtered. The residents, fearing their lewd power, transported rice, flour, firewood, and grass for the bandits to use in order to maintain local peace. In addition, there are also many bandits in Songjiatun in the north of the city, and the villagers are all terrified. Those with a little property have gone to the city to escape. Due to the bandit alerts in the four countryside areas, the Jiaoxian authorities have effectively imposed martial law in the city. The city gates are closed tightly during the day, and those who enter and exit must be strictly interrogated before being allowed to pass. However, it has not been heard that government troops are quickly going to suppress them. (May 8th)</p>
<h3>Organization of the Jinan Military and Political Joint Office</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Chen Diaoyuan, the commander-in-chief of the Punitive Expeditionary Army's General Reserve Corps, has discussed with Han Fuqu, whose First Army Corps and Third Route Army are currently stationed in the province, and Ma Hongkui, whose Fifteenth Route Army is also stationed, the establishment of a joint office to avoid the separation between military and political affairs. The organizational details of the office are as follows: (1) At a time of military emergency, the Punitive Expeditionary Armies are cooperating in battle. On the one hand, the communication between armies and all the requests and related matters between the army and the local area are quite complicated. Since the headquarters of the First Army Corps, the headquarters of the Third Route Army, the office of the Fifteenth Route Army, and the headquarters of the General Reserve Corps are all stationed in Jinan, it is necessary to organize a joint office to respond to events and avoid separation and discord. (2) Based on the above, it is proposed to name it the Punitive Expeditionary Army Jinan Military and Political Joint Office. (3) The Military and Political Joint Office shall be organized by selecting personnel from the following agencies: Headquarters of the First Army Corps, Headquarters of the Third Route Army, Headquarters of the Fifteenth Route Army, Headquarters of the General Reserve Corps, Shandong Provincial Government, Jinan Municipal Government, Jinan Public Security Bureau, Licheng County Government. (4) Each military unit shall select one staff officer and one adjutant (or consultant), and each political unit shall select one or two members, but a director must be appointed to oversee them. Dong Qicheng is requested to be selected by the headquarters of the First Army Corps. (5) The office address shall be selected within Jinan City or established within the Provincial Government. (6) Office hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. (7) All matters related to both military and civilian politics shall be handled by the special representatives of the joint office and the various military and political agencies through mutual consultation at any time. If the matter is important, instructions shall be requested from their direct superiors at any time. (8) A necessary number of clerks, scribes, and messengers shall be appointed. (9) The regulations for public funds and the method of raising them shall be determined by the headquarters of the First Army Corps at a temporary meeting. (10) The headquarters of the First Army Corps shall be responsible for the organization and service guidelines.</p>
<h3>Shandong Province Clears Up Account Handover Cases of Various Counties</h3>
<p>The Department of Finance Has Received Approval to Allocate All Funds to River Conservancy Expenses; Foreign Personnel Must Settle Accounts by a Deadline, or Face Arrest</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong Provincial Department of Finance drafted a method for clearing up unsettled old cases of all outgoing personnel in all counties under the jurisdiction of Shandong Province before May 31st of the 18th year of the Republic of China. It was submitted to the Provincial Government for approval and filing, and a public notice was issued in newspapers for the outgoing county magistrates to follow. Subsequently, the Department dispatched personnel to various counties to urge and supervise the process. When the committee members were dispatched, it was the end of the lunar year, and bandits in various counties were active. The current county magistrates focused on winter defense and had no time to clear up the handover. Furthermore, in recent years, Shandong Province has experienced frequent military conflicts, and county towns have been lost multiple times. In counties that have suffered devastation, old files have been completely destroyed. In some counties, corrupt clerks have taken advantage of the chaos to destroy important documents related to taxes, making it impossible to investigate after many years and multiple changes of officials. Additionally, county magistrates are frequently transferred, and the period for clearing up accounts coincides with the transition between old and new officials. The former officials are about to be replaced and inevitably adopt a wait-and-see attitude, while the new officials claim to be overwhelmed with various administrative tasks at the beginning of their tenure, using this as an excuse. Moreover, last winter, heavy rain and snow made transportation difficult, and the committee members were often unable to reach the counties on time, requesting extensions. In other cases, outgoing personnel had long since left their posts and gone elsewhere. Despite repeated inquiries from current officials, they often delayed and failed to appear. Official documents were sent back and forth, causing delays, and some even submitted perfunctory reports just to get it over with. Due to these various difficulties, the progress of the clearance was inevitably hindered. It is now reported that the Department has received over two hundred cases from county magistrates who have convened committees to report their conclusions. It is estimated that there are still some outstanding cases or cases without county records to clear up. The Department has instructed the current county magistrates to be responsible for independently clearing up and reporting the accounts for further review. All the personnel have been transferred to the province to close their files. As for the aforementioned cases that have already been concluded, the total amount of actual tax arrears under the summary item is 1,339,391.921 yuan, of which 172,273.501 yuan is owed by outgoing personnel after joint calculation in the counties, and 1,167,118.42 yuan is owed according to the fair reports concluded by the current county magistrates' committees. Whether there will be any additions or deletions to the account books in the future will depend on a case-by-case review and verification. The Department Director, Yuan Jiapu, believes that although the amount of these handover arrears is significant, it is extremely difficult to determine the exact amount to be recovered. Therefore, it was not</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>May 12th, the 19th year of the Republic of China (Shen Bao, Second Section) Monday (8)</p>
<p>included in the 19th year's budget. Considering that the province's river conservancy requires a large amount of special funds, which are currently being discussed under orders, it is proposed to allocate all of the old arrears to river conservancy as special funds. In the future, as funds are collected and submitted to the Department, they will be directly handed over to the River Conservancy Committee for special management. Meanwhile, the Department will select competent personnel to collect the funds in different areas to ensure prompt collection. As for those outgoing personnel who are registered in other provinces and have not yet gone to the counties to jointly clear up and report their accounts with the current county magistrates, the Department will investigate and list them separately, publishing the list in newspapers in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Anhui, Hunan, and other provinces. From the date of publication, they will have two months to send personnel to Jinan to jointly calculate and clear up the accounts. Those who fail to do so within the deadline will be reported for arrest to maintain official discipline and protect public funds. The Department has submitted this case to the Provincial Government for submission to the 83rd regular meeting, which resolved to approve and instruct its implementation. The Provincial Government has also ordered the River Conservancy Committee to jointly handle the matter. (9th)</p>
<h3>The Nanxun Railway Attacked and Destroyed by Bandits Again</h3>
<p>Bandits Attacked the De'an Station; Troops Bravely Repelled the Bandits; Passenger Trains Suspended for One Day on the 9th</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence on the 9th: The Nanxun Railway is the lifeline connecting the interior of Jiangxi with the Yangtze River. However, the railway passes through the mountainous areas of Yongxiu and De'an in northern Jiangxi, which have long been areas where bandits and communists operate. The Huanglaomen and Mahuiling stations on the railway have already been burned and looted by bandits, and red flags of the communists are frequently found along the route. Recently, the De'an station was also reported to have been attacked and destroyed by bandits, resulting in the suspension of train services. The incident occurred on the evening of the 8th when two vendors from De'an City went out of the city to shop. One was killed by bandits, and the other ran back to report to the county government. The county magistrate, together with the third battalion commander of the 103rd Regiment of the 18th Division stationed locally, issued an emergency order to deploy two companies of troops and hundreds of security guards around the station and the city walls to maintain a strict defense. Around 4:00 AM, as dawn was breaking, about a thousand bandits with red ribbons around their necks, armed with seven or eight hundred guns, appeared from all directions. Three red flags, one representing the Communist Party, one representing the Peasants' Self-Defense Army, and one representing the Red Army, advanced towards the station and the county town in three routes, raining down bullets with great ferocity. The officers and soldiers bravely resisted, but the bandits still charged towards the west gate. Fortunately, the battalion commander was very brave and personally used a water-cooled machine gun on a high ground to sweep the bandits, killing many of them. The bandits' momentum was slightly repelled. The standoff lasted until 8:00 AM on the 9th, when a battalion of the 18th Division stationed in Tujiapu received the news and advanced towards De'an on a train with two machine guns mounted on it. Seeing that reinforcements had arrived, the bandits scattered into the valleys. The government troops took the opportunity to pursue and capture more than ten bandits, who were all shot outside the station and the west gate. After investigation, several rails between Jianchang and De'an were found to have been broken, three sections of the track between De'an and Mahuiling were dug up, and thirty telephone and telegraph lines were cut. Dozens of lines were also destroyed between Huanglaomen and Mahuiling. A small bridge was also destroyed in one location. Passenger trains between Nanchang and Jiujiang were therefore temporarily suspended. The provincial government has urgently dispatched troops from the 103rd Regiment stationed on the Nanxun Railway to De'an for reinforcement. The Garrison Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau have also sent troops to Niuhang Station to conduct inspections and guard against petty criminals entering the city. The rails and small bridge on the railway can be repaired today, and normal traffic can resume tomorrow (the 10th). The telegraph lines are being repaired quickly but may not be completed today.</p>
<h3>Peng Dehuai Captures Pingjiang; Further News</h3>
<p>He Jian Telegraphed for Large Troops to Suppress; Over a Thousand Refugees Arrived in the Province</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence on the 9th: Pingjiang County, located 120 li from the provincial capital of Changsha, was attacked and captured by the communist Peng Dehuai and his forces, joined by Huang Gonglue, Li Can, Li Shi, Kong Hezhong, and others. The local defense troops and garrison forces were defeated on the night of the 6th, leading to the fall of Pingjiang County and a sudden deterioration of the security situation in the provincial capital. Further reports indicate that the bandits have established a Soviet government in Pingjiang and are sending armed bandits to advance towards Changsha, Jinjing, Xiangyin, Wukou, Wushi, Liuyang, and the northern districts. He Jian has ordered Yu Xianli's troops to guard Xiangyin, Xinshi, and Miluo, and the Changsha troops to guard Gaoqiao and Jinjing, and the Liuyang troops of Wan Fangzhi to block the Liuping Avenue. He has also ordered Wang Dongyuan's Brigade and Yang Zhenpu's Regiment of the 15th Division to rush to the Miluo General Headquarters, and Feng Shixun's Battalion of the 15th Division to rush to Gaoqiao, and Wei Suzhong's Brigade and Wang Zhibin's Regiment of the 15th Division to rush to Xianzhong, to coordinate their advance and suppression efforts. Furthermore, due to the rampant banditry and the people's fear, he has urgently transferred Wang Yingzhao's Regiment of the 19th Division stationed in Hengzhou, Tian Yingtang's Regiment of the 15th Division stationed in Changde, and Chen Cexun's Newly Organized Supplementary Regiment of the Independent 5th Brigade stationed in Sangzhi to the province as quickly as possible, both to strengthen the provincial defense and to plan the suppression efforts. On the evening of the 8th, Wang's Regiment and Chen's Regiment arrived in Changsha by water. He Jian convened the officers and soldiers of the two regiments at the Xiecao Field at 8:00 AM on the morning of the 9th and gave them instructions before they departed for Pingjiang and Xiangyin to await orders. Tian's Regiment is expected to arrive in the province on the afternoon of the 9th. To boost morale and unify command, He Jian has appointed Tao Guang, the commander of the New 31st Division, to rush to Xiangyin and Xinshi to command the aforementioned troops, as well as the local defense forces of Changyin, Liuping, and Yueyang counties, to launch a large-scale suppression effort and retake Pingjiang County within three days. Tao is scheduled to take the Changyue train to Xinshi on the 9th to command everything. It is believed that the bandits will be easily driven out once the large army arrives.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the 8th, over 1,800 refugees who managed to escape from Pingjiang had arrived, including men and women, abandoned children and lost wives, searching for fathers and mothers, a truly tragic scene. Xiao Lvwu, a member of the County Party Department, and Wu Huang, a standing committee member of the Chamber of Commerce, together with Ling Fangyao, the president of the fellow villagers' association in the province, reported the situation to the Provincial Government and the Provincial Relief Committee. He Jian convened Wang Zhengshi, the magistrate of Changsha County, Zhang Zhu, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Li Weixin, a section chief of the Provincial Relief Committee, and Liu Yi, the adjutant of the Provincial Garrison Headquarters, to discuss relief measures, which were decided as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Public Security Bureau and the Garrison Department will send personnel to maintain order at the station, register the refugees by name, and temporarily house those without relatives or friends to rely on at the Taohuajing First Stage and the Zhujia Garden outside the city. (2) The Provincial Government will order the Public Security Bureau to unseal the First Stage to serve as a refugee settlement and instruct the board of directors of the Pingjiang Fellow Villagers' Association in the province to be responsible for checking and reporting. (3) The Provincial Relief Committee will send multiple reliable personnel with funds to purchase bread to save the refugees' lives. (4) The Provincial Relief Committee will send multiple staff members with funds to Changping Avenue and Miluo to distribute relief and aid to the Pingjiang refugees. (5) The Provincial Government will request the Clearing and Suppression Headquarters to order the military to protect the relief personnel at all times and to check the refugees. (6) The gentry of Pingjiang in the province will elect righteous gentlemen to return to Pingjiang with the army and to appease the refugees. (7) The Provincial Relief Committee will order the Pingjiang County Relief Sub-Committee to be jointly responsible for distributing emergency relief and striving for a good aftermath.</p>
<p>In addition, the Provincial Relief Committee also held an urgent meeting and resolved the following relief measures: (1) Immediately distribute bread and dry rations to the refugees to prolong their lives. (2) The Changsha Public Security Bureau and the County Government will designate a fixed residence for the refugees and unite the refugees to maintain public order. (3) After the refugees are united, relief funds will be distributed to them by name. (4) The Changsha Public Security Bureau and the County Government will be responsible for the refugees' food and accommodation. (5) Peng Zhongjing, Liu Guangguo, Kuang Mingqian, Zou Baolin, Gao Jingqi, and Huang Chengchu will each take public servants to the affected areas to provide relief. As refugees continue to flee to the province from Miluo, Xinshi, and Wushi, He Jian, in order to maintain security in the provincial capital, ordered the Provincial Relief Committee to take funds to distribute relief and prohibit them from coming to the province, and instructed the new Pingjiang County Magistrate, Hou Houzong, to rush to Xiangyin to appease the refugees and persuade them to return to Pingjiang with the army to stabilize the area. At the same time, all military police were dispatched to be on guard outside the city to prevent petty criminals from taking advantage of the situation and to ensure safety.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Case Outside Fuzhou</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence on the 8th: Xu Shuiguan of Zhanban Village, outside the North Gate of the provincial capital, has been a farmer by trade and has also been engaged in business in recent years, with a relatively comfortable family. On the evening of April 27th, dozens of bandits suddenly came to his home and kidnapped his 11-year-old eldest son, 9-year-old second son, and two married daughters, as well as his granddaughter, totaling five people. The stolen items were also quite valuable. Wang Tianrui, the commander of the Supplementary Regiment of the 5th Brigade stationed in Wenshanli, outside the West Gate, specially sent out scouts to investigate. It was reported that the case was committed by Jin Fugui, the head of the Zizhi Village in the Yupu District outside the West Gate, along with Lin Tieying, the deputy head of the Yupu District Defense Corps, and a dozen or so soldiers, including Tu E'quan, Luo Jun, and Wang Meige. They had purchased firearms and organized a battalion, with Jin as the battalion commander and Lin and Tu as the company commanders. Commander Zhou of the Special Service Company of the 5th Brigade (currently stationed in Pupuxiang) was instructed to lure Jin Fugui to the regimental headquarters in Wenshanli for talks. Jin went without suspicion. Commander Wang questioned him, and his words were evasive. Finally, Commander Wang wanted to inspect the firearms of the Yupu District Defense Corps and mentioned the kidnapping of Xu Shuiguan's family. Jin's confession became even more hesitant. Commander Wang concluded that Jin and his accomplices were indeed responsible for the case. He then sent a team to arrest the deputy corps commander Lin Tieying and three soldiers to the regimental headquarters for interrogation. They immediately confessed the crime. Commander Wang then sent a company of soldiers to Chadoulou Township in the northern district, eight li away from Pupuxiang, at around 2:00 AM, along with Lin Tieying, and captured bandits such as Luo Wang and Lao Shen, seizing four rifles and one pistol, and rescuing the five kidnapped members of the Xu family. Commander Wang, accompanied by two orderlies, rushed to Zhongfang Township in the dark of night and, together with company commanders Luo Zhenren and Li Zhiying, captured Chen Jiazhen, totaling ten bandits. The five kidnapped members of the Xu family have been claimed by their family members. Zhanban Township is less than seven or eight li from the city, and the occurrence of a kidnapping case shows the state of security in Fujian Province.</p>
<h3>The Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department Incident Subsided</h3>
<p>The Alumni Association's Request to Establish a Clearing and Suppression Office Was Rejected; A Harmony Banquet Between the Military and Political Sides at the Nanxuan Restaurant</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: An incident occurred between the staff of the Civil Affairs Department of this province and the representatives of the Alumni Association of the Fourth Military School over the proposal to discuss and pilot a clearing and suppression office in the three counties of Minyongqing. The Civil Affairs Department submitted a general resignation to the Provincial Government. The Provincial Government has now approved the general resignation and issued a comforting order, urging them to work together and overcome difficulties. The staff of the Civil Affairs Department have resumed their duties after receiving this comforting order. However, Zhou Han, the director of the secretariat, was granted a 20-day leave of absence for recuperation due to his weakened health after mourning his parents. His duties will be temporarily performed by Huang Zuhan, the secretary. As for the representatives of the Alumni Association of the Fourth Military School, after the conflict with the staff of the Civil Affairs Department, they submitted another request to the Provincial Government to establish a clearing and suppression office in the three counties. However, their wording was different from the second time, stating in essence that the monthly subsidies given to the association by the Provincial Government were insufficient to cover their expenses, and therefore they requested to run the clearing and suppression office in order to serve their hometowns and solve their livelihood problems at the same time. Zhan Baoting, Zhang Baorong, and others visited Chen Peikun to state their case and request approval. Chen said that the matter was significant and beyond his ability to resolve alone, and promised to submit it to a joint military and political meeting for discussion. The representatives then withdrew. After the joint meeting discussed the matter, it was decided that the methods proposed by the Alumni Association were inconsistent with the clearing and suppression regulations, and that the matter was the responsibility of the military authorities and did not require the establishment of a separate office. The request was therefore rejected. However, the relationship between the staff of the Civil Affairs Department and the alumni of the Fourth Military School should not be estranged for too long, as this could lead to other obstacles in the future. The other day, a certain party took the initiative to mediate and hosted a banquet for the representatives of the Alumni Association of the Fourth Military School and the section chiefs and secretaries of the Civil Affairs Department, totaling more than ten people, at the Nanxuan Restaurant on Nandajie in order to dispel suspicions and celebrate amicably.

<h3>The Establishment of the Chinese Workers' Office of the Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Two Official Bureaus Jointly Appoint the Director</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: There are as many as 5,000 Chinese workers on the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER). Not counting the various places along the line, the 36 sheds and the CER factory in Harbin alone have about 1,400 workers. In the 11th year of the Republic of China, workers, in order to seek their own welfare, presented a request to the authorities to form an Industrial Maintenance Association, with a general association in Harbin and branch associations along the line. At the beginning, the leaders of the workers' union were able to advocate for the workers' interests and eliminate harm. However, cunning individuals seized the opportunity to become active elements. Disputes and struggles for power were frequent. In particular, the uncertain amount of workers' membership fees and the secret nature of expenditures were criticized by many. Recently, the dispute over the chairmanship has escalated to labor-management issues, and labor disputes have been escalating uncontrollably. Last month, in order to address the root cause, the Office of the Special Administrative Region Governor and the Office of the CER Director General jointly requested the Northeast Political Affairs Committee to abolish the workers' union and have officials organize a railway workers' office to prevent the surge of labor disputes and to seek the legitimate interests of the workers. It was officially established on May 1st. The two official bureaus jointly appointed Li Linchuan and Wang Wenpu as the director and deputy director, respectively. The announcement of the regulations is recorded below: "It has been found that the Chinese workers of the CER in Harbin have had an Industrial Maintenance Association, but due to poor management, many workers are dissatisfied, and even attack each other, causing disputes. Not only is it not beneficial to the workers, but it also causes a lot of trouble. Therefore, in view of this most unfavorable phenomenon, we have to resolutely request that the Industrial Maintenance Association in this city and its branch associations along the line be abolished. If we still follow the previous methods and reorganize in the same way, the so-called 'new wine in old bottles' may still be unavoidable. Therefore, the official bureau believes that in order to seek benefits for the workers and help them do some proper and beneficial things, and to guide the workers on the road to happiness, we must first make proper arrangements for the workers. Now, we have organized a Chinese Workers' Office for the workers and have formulated provisional regulations, which have been submitted to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee for filing. All affairs will naturally be carried out in accordance with the regulations. In simple terms, the office has a director and deputy director to oversee the whole thing. Under the director, there are councilors, staff, and clerks, most of whom are elected by the workers themselves. The election method will be stipulated separately. The office mentioned above is in this city. In addition, there are branch offices in the east, west, and south, and the regulations are currently being drafted. The most important thing is that the expenses of the office should be paid by the workers in accordance with the regulations. However, in order to take special care of the workers, all the expenses of the office will be provided by the official bureau and will not be supplied by the workers, so as to lighten the burden on the workers. The office will do its best to carry out matters that are beneficial to the workers, and the office must eliminate matters that are harmful to the workers in order to implement the official bureau's concern for the workers. This is specially and clearly announced, along with the provisional regulations of the office. The office will be established on May 1st. I hope that all Chinese workers of the CER will join the office as soon as possible so that they can elect their respective staff members as soon as possible. This is the official bureau's sincere intention to protect the workers. Please abide by it and do not hesitate. This announcement." (1st)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Lacks Women</h3>

<p>Dispatching Personnel to Shanghai to Receive the Kidnappers from Yexie: Chen Yiyan's family of Yexie Maojingtan, a county-administered area, was attacked by a large number of bandits on the evening of the 1st of this month. Seven people, including Chen Jinshi, Chen Shenshi, Chen Gushi, Chen Xingsheng, Chen Dongguan, Xia Jinshan, and Wang Xiaodi, were kidnapped and taken to the vicinity of Fengjing. First, Chen Xingsheng, Chen Jinshi, and Xia Jinshan were released, and the rest were taken to a secret location in Shanghai for ransom. During their unloading at Rihui Port, the hostages were forced into rickshaws, where Chen Gushi called for help, leading to the case's breakthrough.

<p>Repercussions of the "Education Bankruptcy" Performance: The county Education Bureau held an exhibition of achievements from various schools across the county on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th of this month. On the last evening, a welcoming party was held at the city school, featuring various songs, dances, and new dramas. One drama, titled "Education Bankruptcy," was written by Zhang Licheng, a teacher at the junior high school, and directed by Shen Mingshi. The content violated ministerial orders, slandered education, and promoted outdated ideas. The entire audience expressed opposition at the time, and the atmosphere was tense. Huang Ruzhe, a member of the county's Party Affairs Reorganization Committee, rose and spoke, denouncing the inappropriate drama. The entire audience applauded in agreement. The next day, the County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee resolved at a meeting to instruct the Education Bureau to discipline the playwright and director of the drama. It is understood that the Education Bureau has forwarded the order to the school authorities for compliance.</p>
<p>Strictly Quashing Rumors of Child Kidnapping for Bridge Sacrifice: Recently, rumors of child kidnapping for bridge sacrifices have circulated in neighboring counties such as Shanghai, Jiading, and Songjiang. Although there has been talk in this county, it has remained calm. However, this morning, when the various elementary schools in the city were in session, students' families rushed to the schools to take their children home. The panic was severe. Despite the efforts of school staff to refute the rumors, families remained skeptical, which greatly affected the schools. Upon hearing this, the County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee specially passed a resolution to issue a public notice refuting the rumors and sent a letter to the county government to strictly investigate those who spread the rumors to deter illegal activities.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Breaking Up a Major Opium Trafficking Ring: Wu Songqi and Yin Rongquan, two well-known opium traffickers in this city, have been setting up an organization at No. 13, Zhuyuan Lane, Zhoushanbang, outside Guangfu Gate to traffic in large quantities of opium. Yesterday, County Magistrate Sun received a secret letter from Director Hu of the Civil Affairs Department, ordering the secret arrest of the major opium traffickers Wu Songqi and Yin Rongquan. Magistrate Sun immediately instructed Judicial Director Wu Hou to lead the police to the scene, where they arrested Wu and Yin (aliases Zhou Asheng), along with porters Jin Caibao, landlord Xu Chenshi, and tenant Liu Zhangshi. They also seized 45 packages (two taels each) of "Chun He Ji" Lao Chuan opium, two boxes of red pills, nine taels of opium paste, six large and small account books, two Wu Songqi residual stamp woodcuts, and twelve stamps (including Yuan Tai Zhen Ji ticket stubs, Wuxi Beintang Opium Prohibition Association, Changhe Company, and verification stamps from the special tax offices of Hunan and Hubei), as well as cash, banknotes, and small change. Director Wu transferred the witnesses and evidence to the county for trial. After the trial, an order was issued to detain them all. A report was submitted to the Civil Affairs Department requesting instructions for handling the case.</p>
<p>Two Robberies Occur in Rural Areas: Xu Fusheng, a resident of Fenghuangji near Qingcheng East Lane in this county, lives on a boat and specializes in raising geese and ducks. The couple worked diligently and saved a little money. However, at about 12 o'clock the night before last, five robber boats suddenly arrived, with more than a dozen bandits armed with sharp knives and flashlights. They rushed onto the boat, tied up Xu Fusheng and his wife with hemp ropes, and beat them severely. They then ransacked the boat, stealing 120 white geese and a large amount of clothing. After the villagers gathered, they captured two robber boats, two bandits named Huang Decai and Huang Chenshi, and two children. The stolen white geese were also recovered. The remaining robber boats escaped to Baitang圩. After the incident, the Public Security Bureau sent personnel to the countryside to investigate and escorted the captured robbers and boats to the city and handed them over to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Furthermore, a boat belonging to Chen Shu of Gushan was sailing from the countryside to the city last night. When the boat arrived outside the Sanbaqiao intersection of Huaixia City, it suddenly encountered a net boat with six or seven bandits, each armed with handguns and iron bars. They boarded the boat and robbed it for half an hour before taking the stolen goods and escaping by boat. In this incident, a total of 500 yuan in Jiangbei remittance drafts from Zhang Quantai, over 60,000 copper coins, and passengers' clothes and silver dollars, totaling six or seven hundred yuan, were robbed.</p>
<p>Escapees Interrogated and Shackled: In the case of the seven prisoners, including Li Chengguo, who escaped from the Wuxi Detention Center, Wu Zhengrong, the Chief of Political Police, apprehended the two robbers involved, Yuan Asan and Wu Xirong, in Shanghai. They were escorted to Wuxi the day before yesterday. That night, County Magistrate Sun opened a court to interrogate them. According to Yuan Asan's confession, Wu Xirong escaped from the city wall via the south gate on the day of the escape and fled towards Shanghai along the railway for four days. He did not know where the remaining five, including Li Chengguo, had gone. Wu Xirong's confession was the same. After the interrogation, the two prisoners were ordered to be heavily shackled and imprisoned. A telegram was sent to Director Hu of the Civil Affairs Department requesting instructions for handling the case.</p>
<p>Record of Labor-Management Conference at Silk Factory: Three years ago, the silk factories in Wuxi signed a labor-management agreement, which both parties have been abiding by. Now, the labor representatives, the Silk Factory Workers' Union, have proposed revising the agreement and setting 24 new conditions, demanding the factory's approval. The factory convened four meetings of all its members to seriously discuss these conditions. They all believed that the silk factory had been failing year after year and was on the verge of bankruptcy. Maintaining the existing conditions was already difficult, and the conditions proposed by the labor side were too harsh and impossible to accept. However, in order to respect the wishes of the labor side and maintain a spirit of cooperation, they could only slightly increase salaries, wages, silkworm moths, and three points within a possible range; otherwise, they would perish together. Yesterday was the date for the joint conference between the two parties. Each side sent more than 30 representatives. The factory representatives proposed the three points decided in the previous meeting, requesting forgiveness. However, the labor side insisted that the differences were too great and that all 24 conditions had to be fully approved. Both sides argued fiercely for hours without reaching a solution. Another meeting was scheduled for further discussion.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Visiting Delegation from Zhejiang University Arrives in Tongzhou: The agricultural college of Zhejiang University has long admired Nantong's educational and industrial achievements as a national model. After a letter of introduction from Dean Tan, Director Li of the Nantong University agricultural department sent someone to guide the delegation. Upon arrival in Tongzhou, the agricultural department hosted the delegation. In addition to visiting the agricultural department's farm, seedling nursery, fish pond, horticulture department, livestock farm, sericulture farm, afforestation area, and weather station, as well as the Nantong University's medical school, hospital, textile department, library, and museum, they were also introduced to Langshan, Liang Tangzha, and the educational and industrial organizations and scenic spots established by Zhang Jian. A welcome meeting was specially opened by the agricultural department of Tongzhou University, which all the teachers and students of the delegation attended. They had tea and talked for a long time before dispersing.</p>
<p>Police Captain Injures Car Company Owner: Jin Juechen, the Captain of the Nantong County Police Brigade, was accused of injuring Xue Chuntang, the owner of Lu Shun Automobile Company. All automobile businesses went on strike for ten days. The county court issued a summons for the criminal in the case, Jin Juechen. Platoon Leader Li Hanbin and police officers Liang Qinghai and Wang Hongchen turned themselves in. Li returned to the brigade headquarters, while Liang and Wang were detained in the Fourth Prison. Zhuang Chuntang, who was injured, suddenly woke up after being given a stimulant injection by a doctor in the hospital, but he is still not out of danger. At 4:00 PM on the 10th, representatives from all walks of life gathered in the hospital lobby and requested the presence of the County Court President and Chief Prosecutor to punish the criminals according to law. They also advised the automobile businesses to resume operations in order to restore transportation.</p>
<p>Landlords Collecting Wheat Rent Should Not Be Prohibited: In the Jiangbei Tong area, each salt reclamation zone traditionally collects wheat rent after the spring harvest. Due to tenant resistance, the provincial government ordered the county government that wheat rent is the rent that landlords should collect and is not excessive. It should not be prohibited, and the tenants should be persuaded to pay.</p>
<p>Bandit Forces Resurge in Eastern Nantong: In recent days, bandit gangs claiming to be the Red Army have invaded various areas in eastern Nantong, including Jinsha, Shigang, and Xiting. They are rampant. The National Army's Hu Battalion stationed in the city and the provincial police force led by Li Jing were dispatched on the 10th to intercept and suppress them. Tongcheng is under special martial law.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Six Party Departments in Jiangbei Strive for Highway Bureau: The Second Branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Highway Bureau was originally funded by the acreage donation of eight counties: Huaian, Huaiyin, Lianshui, Siyang, Gaoyou, Baoying, Yancheng, and Funing. In 1927, it was unconditionally taken over by the Construction Department. Last month, the Party Departments of the six counties of Huaian, Huaiyin, Lianshui, Siyang, Gaoyou, and Baoying held a meeting at the Huaiyin County Party Department to discuss the recovery of the Second Highway Bureau in Jiangbei. The representatives of the six counties jointly submitted a request to the Provincial Party Department, which was forwarded to the Construction Department for approval. The representatives of Huaiyin, Lianshui, and Gaoyou were sent to the province to negotiate. After arriving in the province, the representatives went to the Construction Department and explained the matter in detail. Secretary-General Zhang Zhu of the Construction Department told the representatives that the former director of the Second Highway Bureau had been improperly appointed, resulting in operating losses of tens of thousands of yuan. Since Director Sun took office, he has been working to rectify the situation, so he sent personnel to Huai to transport all the vehicles to Zhenjiang for repairs. In the future, he will definitely invite merchants to take over the operation and will not disregard the road traffic. As the branch bureau was originally funded by the acreage donation of eight counties, the proceeds will naturally be used in the eight counties. It is feared that transferring the operation to the local authorities may not yield good results, so the request was denied. The representatives, with their objectives unmet, still intend to continue their efforts.</p>
<p>Provincial Police Cooperate to Suppress Taixing Bandits: The Jiangsu Provincial Security Department reported last night at around 8 o'clock that over a thousand bandits led by Tian Nu suddenly arrived at Guangling Town in Taixing, burned dozens of houses, and looted. Director Li telegraphed Captain Yang of the provincial police force stationed in Huangqiao to join forces with County Magistrate Guo of Taixing and County Magistrate Wang of Jingjiang to work together to eliminate the bandits fundamentally.</p>
<p>Change of Director of the Telephone Bureau: Fu Yan, the director of the Zhenjiang Telephone Bureau, was transferred to the Suhu Telephone Bureau by the Ministry of Communications yesterday. Wang Defen, the director of the Wuhu Telegraph Bureau, was appointed to fill the vacancy.</p>
<p>Yiyuanxiang Oil Shop Goes Bankrupt: The Yiyuanxiang Oil Shop in Yinshanmen declared bankruptcy yesterday due to financial difficulties. It owes more than 9,000 taels of silver to various businesses in the port and has deposits of more than 20,000 yuan, including 6,000 to 7,000 yuan deposited by a Jinshan monk. The Qianye Public Association sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce requesting the Public Security Bureau to send personnel to jointly seal up the remaining goods after surveying the books and records, awaiting the shop owner's appearance to settle the matter.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Eight Districts Propose to Collect Acreage Tax to Run Autonomous County: Yang Guoxiang, the head of the eight autonomous districts, submitted a request to collect acreage tax monthly to subsidize the expenses of the township public offices in the district, along with proposed measures. The plan is to levy one cent for five acres or more, one and a half cents for ten acres or more, two cents for twenty to fifty acres or more, and two and a half cents for fifty to one hundred acres or more. Wealthy households with more than five acres would be subject to special supplementary payments. Yesterday (the 9th), the county specially ordered the district head to convene a public meeting of township residents, using the autonomous covenant as a standard.</p>
<p>Salt Transport Commissioner Orders Yongjiheng to Clear Debts: Zhang Sizhang, the Salt Transport Commissioner of Lianghuai, stated that the bankruptcy of the Yunshang Yongjiheng Salt Shop had greatly affected Yangzhou's finances. Yesterday, he specially ordered the Sian Office to inform Zhou Weibin, the shop owner, to come to Yangzhou immediately and clear his debts within a limited time to maintain the overall situation. It is said that the Sian Office notified the shop owner after receiving the order.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Requests Opening of Various Guijiang Dams: The Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram requesting the opening of various Guijiang dams, stating: "This year's spring rainfall has been excessive, and the water level in the canal has risen sharply. Recently, the stake marking at the Three Gates has reached over one zhang. The low-lying fields on both sides of the Grand Canal north of the Yangtze River and along the lake are about to be flooded. Although the Jiangbei River Works Department opened the Xinhe dam last month in hopes of diverting some water, the river water continues to rise by more than two inches due to the continuous spring rain. Opening one dam is insufficient. If the Jianglan dams are not continuously opened, the wheat planted in the fields along the coast will likely be lost. At this time when there is a shortage of food, in order to maintain the livelihood of the people of Jiangbei, there is no better solution than to request your department to order the Jiangbei River Works Department to quickly open the Guijiang dams. Furthermore, the river embankment is just beginning to be repaired, and the funds are insufficient, and the project is incomplete. If precautions are not taken in advance, the consequences will be unimaginable. The flooding in Jiangbei in 1921 was due to the River Works Bureau's concern for salt merchants storing water for salt transport, delaying the opening of the Guijiang dams, failing to plan early, and causing the flooding of the river surface, resulting in the suffering of the people in the Jiangbei counties."</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Bandits Burned and Looted Guangling Town in Jiangbei: The banditry in Jiyang has been rampant in recent days. The bandits held a large meeting in Chang'an City and then set fire to places such as Mabailingdai. Around 6 p.m. the day before yesterday, hundreds of bandits arrived in Guangling Town, carrying machine guns, mountain cannons, rifles, and ammunition. They set fire in Beiya while looting in Nanjie. The Jiyang police and the defense corps temporarily retreated due to their weak strength, defending Fanjiashiqiao and Liuhashi. There was a fierce battle between the soldiers and bandits all night, and the cannon fire could be heard in Jingcheng. Yesterday (the 10th), Jingcheng was completely closed. The northwest gates were not opened until 10 a.m. In recent days, many people from Jiangbei have crossed the Yangtze River to the south to take refuge.</p>
<p>Sealing Up the Red Pill Manufacturing House: In the case of confiscating the red pill manufacturing house in Zhangqing Township, Assistant Jiang Yizun of the district and the deputy commander of the defense corps Zhao Zifang, and member Jiang Weisheng were detained and interrogated by the county government. They were released on bail pending further interrogation. County Magistrate Li ordered the red pill manufacturing house in the area to be sealed up according to law. The day before yesterday, he ordered political police Lu Hualin and Liu Xiangting to go to Su Jiayuan, Su Linshu, and Su Baosheng's house in the 20th village and Jiang Taochun's house in the 19th village at the gate to seal them up. The police followed the order and sealed up two houses in Su Jiayuan, Su Linshu, and Baosheng's house, totaling eight tile houses and two side rooms, and two houses in Jiang Taochun's house at the gate in the 19th village. They returned to the city last night and will report the sealing situation to the county government this morning (the 11th).</p>

<p>Police Kill Bandit and Recover Hostage: Huang Gongzheng, the captain of the second squadron of the police force, is in charge of defense in the northern countryside. He engaged in a long and fierce battle with bandits in the Santao area the day before yesterday, killing the notorious bandit Zhang Xuwen on the spot. The remaining bandits fled in disarray.

Both sides opened fire, resulting in the capture of six people and the death of one bandit. The bandits were taken to the Public Security Branch for interrogation. It was learned that Jin Qiliang had knowingly harbored stolen goods and participated in the distribution of stolen goods, which was a serious offense. A search of Jin Qiliang's house resulted in the arrest of Jin Qiliang, the seizure of two handguns, and dozens of stolen goods, which were all escorted to the county government for investigation.</p>
<p>County Government Police Affairs Conference: The county government convened a conference at the county government at 2:00 PM on the 10th, gathering the chiefs of the Public Security Bureau, the water police's 7th and 8th brigades, and the armed officers of the defense corps and provincial defense army to discuss plans for county police affairs, local defense, and suppression of bandits.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>County Government Issues Notice to Refute Rumors: Rumors of child snatching occurred inside and outside Jiaxing on the afternoon of the 10th, and were immediately spread. Those who did not understand the truth were alarmed and warned their children not to go out, which hindered school classes. Although the school authorities repeatedly advised against it, it was of little effect. It was then reported to the education authorities, requesting the county government to issue an order to investigate and ban the rumors and to investigate the source of the rumors. After receiving the report, the county government immediately telegraphed various public security bureaus to investigate and issued a notice to refute the rumors.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>

<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Details of Wang Canlan's Kidnapping and Safe Escape: Wang Qiufu, of Yindi Village in the southern countryside, who has a relatively well-to-do family, has been targeted by kidnappers several times, but has been lucky enough to avoid them. On the evening of the 18th of last month, when his eldest son, Canlan, returned from the fields, seven or eight kidnappers suddenly followed him, captured him, and searched the house. They also dragged his second son, Shenglan, and worker A Yong, out from under the bed and handed them over to two bandits guarding the door. Shenglan seized the opportunity to break free from the bandits and fled. The bandits fired three shots in a row, but missed. After the bandits led Canlan and A Yong out, they fired more than a dozen shots towards Yang Goukeng on the border of Yu and Feng. Later, Qiufu returned home from his neighbor's house and saw two bandit letters left on the table, demanding a loan of 36,000 yuan in foreign currency, to be delivered to the Longwang Temple in Kaokeng by the 22nd. Qiufu and others were panicking when they suddenly saw the worker A Yong panting as he ran back. When asked how he escaped, he said, "After I was kidnapped, I followed the bandits for about a hundred steps. I heard Xiao Dian Wang (Canlan) crying for his mother very miserably, but we were too far apart to talk to each other. The four bandits around me were all wearing gray military uniforms and carrying long guns. When we got to the outskirts of the village, we saw two more bandits holding wooden-cased guns waiting. After walking about three or four miles, a bandit took out a banknote and gave it to me, ordering me to tell Xiao Dian Wang's family situation. I refused. The bandit got angry and threatened me with a gun. I begged to be spared. After walking a few more miles, the bandits spared my life and told me to bring a message to Lao Dian Wang to quickly prepare the money and go to redeem him." Qiufu's whole family was greatly saddened. While sending someone to the bandit's den to negotiate the price, they did not expect that Canlan would escape and return home on the afternoon of the 7th of this month, along with another person. After learning the details, they learned that the person who came with him had been a leader of the bandits. Because he did not want to continue living as a bandit, he released Canlan at the time. Canlan promised to give him a reward of 3,000 yuan. The bandit only said that he wanted him to find a place for him to eat, and asked for nothing else. After arriving safely in the village, when Canlan wanted to fulfill his promise, the bandit declined. Later, seeing that the farmer had nowhere to turn to, he took a small amount of travel expenses and left.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Silkworm Inquiries and Cocoon Market in the Southeast Countryside: The early silkworm inquiries in the southeast countryside of Xiaoshan have already passed, and the late silkworms are also in the third sleep. The temperature is not good, and there is no change in the sleep inquiries. The price of mulberry leaves before the beginning of summer was two yuan per load, but has recently risen to four yuan. However, in the southern countryside, due to famine and neighboring bandits, villagers do not dare to raise many silkworms, so the price of leaves is only two yuan. Each cocoon market is scheduled to open on the 15th in the eastern countryside and on the 20th in the southern countryside. Farmers in Xizhou Robbed and Suffered Losses: On the 7th at about 8:00 PM, more than a dozen bandits suddenly came to the Zhang family in Xizhou outside the south gate. They broke into the house and locked up the five members of the Zhang family, both men and women, in one room. They searched the house and robbed them of a total of more than 500 yuan in clothes, jewelry, and silver. They also robbed the Zhou family of clothes, jewelry, and silver worth about 200 yuan, and five dou of white rice.</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Refugees Passing Through: On the morning of the 7th, about 300 Hunan refugees arrived at the village of Suoqian in Xiaoshan, begging for food from door to door. The villagers gathered more than 120 yuan in small change and one dou of white rice and sent them out of the territory. They went to the villages near the Yulin Pass in Shaoxing County to beg for food.</p>
<p>Famine Victims in Zhaicun Stirring, Requesting Troops for Suppression: Due to the influence of neighboring bandits and the fact that famine victims in the Zhaicun area of the southern countryside of Xiaoshan are gathering in groups of three or five, there is a strong sense of unrest. Rumors are spreading that they intend to rob rice shops and wealthy households. Yesterday, representatives of the villagers telegraphed the provincial and county governments, requesting that troops be sent to be stationed to suppress them.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Major Fire at Wuyan in Xixi, Yin County: Wuyan in the western countryside of Yin County is a large mountain clan, with houses built close together, relying on the mountains.

An investigation after the incident revealed that one person was burned to death, 273 buildings were burned down, and 89 families were affected, with total losses estimated at more than 82,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The Grandeur of the Funeral at the Yu Residence in Longshan: The Yu Residence in Longshan held a funeral for the mother of Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a giant businessman from Ningbo in Shanghai. Yesterday, Chairman Jiang of the National Government, represented by Ye Zhuotang, and Chairman Zhang of Zhejiang Province, represented by Qian Xinzhi, arrived in Ningbo by boat from Shanghai and then went to Longshan to pay their respects. Yang Ziyi, the mayor of Ningbo, Chen Baolin, the magistrate of Yin County, and leaders from all walks of life, such as Chen Nanjin, Lin Qinxiang, and Ren Xingeng, also went to Longshan to pay their respects. Furthermore, the funeral at the Yu Residence was very large in scale, with many participants from all walks of life in China and the West. Therefore, in addition to the Zhenhai Fortress Command sending a protection team of one battalion, the Seawater Police Department sending two patrol ships, and the various field offices sending Suinan patrol ships to Longshan for security, the Shanghai Security Corps and important figures from the detective community also sent large teams to assist. Therefore, in recent days, the ground of Longshan has been heavily guarded by military and police, and the security has been strict. The funeral can be said to be extremely grand.</p>

<h3>China Baseball Team</h3>
<p>Wins Against Japanese Team 2-1 Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the China baseball team once again defeated the renowned Japanese baseball team 2-1 at the China Baseball Field. The game lasted for nine innings, with the first eight innings being closely watched by both sides, making it difficult to move forward. The fate of the two teams was determined in the seventh inning. Japan scored one point to take the lead, while China scored two points to come from behind. The sudden victories and defeats were truly the most dynamic scene of the entire nine innings.</p>
<h3>(I) Two Pitchers with Outstanding Talent</h3>
<p>The pitcher's position occupies an important role in the entire team. The power over the life and death of the enemy lies in their wrist. Therefore, only those with a strong iron arm, divine and unpredictable curves, and long-term experience can take on this important task. The pitcher for China the other day was Cheng Bingguan, while yesterday the so-called first-class pitcher Zhong You personally took the field. The skills of a famous general are indeed impressive, only allowing the opponent to get two hits in the end, which is truly not easy. Japanese pitcher Hirai is one of the famous pitchers at sea. His pitches are fast and full of curves, making them difficult to hit. Compared to Zhong You, they can be called evenly matched. When two such talented Chinese and Japanese pitchers meet, displaying their skills against each other, the intensity of the situation and the doubling of excitement can be expected.</p>
<h3>(II) Displaying Supernatural Powers, Holding the Fort</h3>
<p>The outstanding pitching techniques of the Chinese and Japanese pitchers have already been mentioned above. In addition, the skills of the outfielders, infielders, and catchers are also superior. Therefore, hitters are either eliminated at the beginning or killed halfway through. Achieving complete success is as difficult as ascending to heaven. Japan attacked first, but all three players were out before reaching first base. The same happened to China. The first inning ended here. In the second inning, Japan still did not achieve their goal. Only Tanabe got a hit and occupied first base. When a mistake occurred at second base, China's Lin Yan occupied first base. He ambitiously attempted to steal second base but failed and was out. There is nothing else worth mentioning. In the third inning, Japan's Takahashi occupied first base due to four balls. Later, he attempted to steal second base but was spotted by Chinese catcher Cai Yunping, who quickly threw the ball and got there before him. The remaining players did not develop. China's Cheng Guanbing's iron arm was activated, getting a hit and occupying first base. Zhong You made a sacrifice bunt, and Cheng advanced to second base. However, the two players who followed did not achieve their goals, and Cheng also stopped there, to no avail. In the fourth and fifth innings, both China and Japan had difficulty making progress. In summary, during the first five innings, both sides displayed their supernatural powers and held the fort. What is worth recording is: (1) China and Japan each got one hit; (2) China once advanced to second base, while Japan never crossed first base.</p>
<h3>(III) Deciding Life and Death, Soldiers Giving Their All</h3>
<p>From the sixth inning onwards, the situation became tense. Takahashi was fortunate enough to walk to first base again due to four balls. Hirai made a sacrifice bunt, and Takahashi advanced to second base. Then, Takahashi took the opportunity to steal third base. At that time, the hitter was Mumu, and the pitch was caught by the pitcher, who initially pretended to throw to third base, so Takahashi dared not move forward. The catcher then quickly threw to first base, and Mumu was out first. Mumu's being out and Takahashi's not daring to advance were due to the pitcher's skill. Finally, Kimura's hit was caught by veteran Feng Enci, and the whole army narrowly escaped death and passed safely. Then, all three Chinese players who came to bat were out one after another. The seventh inning was the key to the day's victory or defeat. Soldiers on both sides gave their all and fought hard. Fujiwara's pitch was very high, and the catcher dropped the ball. Fujiwara advanced to first base. Then, Fujiwara occupied second base with a sacrifice bunt by Fanhashi and finally scored, opening the score for Japan, thanks to Uemoto's hit. Uemoto also occupied second base. However, the two players who followed were out one after another, and the formation was reorganized. China then switched from defense to offense. First, Lu Shujie got on base with a hit, then successfully stole a base. With Feng Yuhe's hit, Lu was on third base and Feng occupied first base. When Cai Yunping hit the ball, the Japanese catcher suddenly dropped the ball. Lu quickly scored, and Feng also occupied third base. Cai made a sacrifice bunt, and Feng also scored. In this inning, China scored two points, and Japan scored one point. In the eighth inning, the Chinese and Japanese pitchers each made amazing performances. No one on third base dared to challenge. In the ninth inning, Japan's progress was still unfavorable. China, with victory in hand, felt no need to fight again and gave up the game. The nine-inning game ended with China winning against Japan with a score of two to one.</p>

<p>(Hangzhou Correspondence) The Hangzhou City Open Women's Track and Field Competition, actively prepared by the Zhejiang Provincial Sports Association, opened on time yesterday (10th) at 2:00 PM at the Public Sports Field on the shores of West Lake. Although it was scorching and sunny, there were still thousands of spectators, which shows that the citizens of Hangzhou have a considerable awareness of the importance of sports. There were originally 32 athletes participating, but due to the hot weather yesterday, some did not report due to physical reasons. Only two-thirds of them actually participated. At that time, the chief referee announced the opening of the meeting and then competed in the order originally scheduled. However, the 50-meter preliminary round and the 100-meter preliminary round were changed to finals because there were not many participants. The results are recorded as follows:</p>

<h3>Hangzhou Cross-Country Race Over 10,000 Meters</h3>
<p>Qulingru Wins First Place with a Time of 26 Minutes, 10.7 Seconds</p>
<p>(Hangzhou Correspondence) The Hangzhou City Open Cross-Country Race initiated by the Zhejiang Provincial Sports Association was held yesterday, the 11th, at 10:00 AM, with participants gathering in front of the Public Education Hall's sports field and setting off. There were many spectators along the way. The Public Security Bureau dispatched police to maintain order and temporarily suspended traffic for an hour. After the departure, the road was filled with racers. When reaching the foot of Baoshi Mountain, Qulingru of Zhijiang was in the lead, followed closely by Sha Richang, who had previously won the provincial 10,000-meter race. The rest are too numerous to mention. When reaching Xiling Bridge, they were still in the lead. When reaching the front of the Xiling Seal Society, Chen Zhengzu of Huilan suddenly caught up with Sha Richang. The audience applauded, but the distance from the first place was still about half a li. When reaching Broken Bridge, each inspector followed behind the first place on a bicycle. When reaching the finish line, the result was: 1st place: Qulingru of Zhijiang; 2nd place: Chen Zhengzu; 3rd place: Sha Richang; 4th place: Wu Zhigao; 5th place: Ma Anzhi. Only the top five were selected this time. The distance run was over 10,000 meters, passing through West Lake and Xiling Bridge, turning back to the sports field. The time of only 26 minutes and 30.7 seconds is commendable. In order to encourage participation, commemorative gifts will be awarded to those who finished sixth to sixteenth after the committee meets.</p>

Otherwise, it had a great chance of winning first place. The group list and results are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>First Place: Group 4: Wu Shunwen, Ge Qukang, Chen Zhengzu, Chen Changzhen. Time: 40 minutes and 55 seconds.</p>

<h3>Grand Occasion of the Sports Association Welcoming Athletes</h3>
<p>All the athletes of our country who will attend the Far Eastern Games have gathered in Shanghai and will depart for Japan on the 15th of this month. The National Sports Association held a banquet at Xinghualou last night to welcome the male and female athletes and guests. The event was crowded with people, and the atmosphere was extremely lively. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Number of Attendees: Those who attended included the directors of the Sports Association and guests Zhao Jinqing, Zhou Xiangxian, Liu Hongsheng, Qu Wenliu, Lin Wenhou, Zhang Yuejun (representing Tang Naikang), Chen Yiting, Ding Shujing, Hao Boyang, all the male and female athletes, and reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers, totaling more than 200 people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: When the wine was half-drunk, Chairman Zhao Jinqing stood up and reported, saying that there were two most important points in China's preparations for participating in the 9th Far Eastern Games: (1) The most difficult point was ultimately the economy, but the fundraising results were satisfactory and comforting. (2) You have come from afar to gather in Shanghai, and tonight you are meeting each other in preparation to win glory for the country. This is the achievement of the second part. But the progress of these two points should be credited to Mr. Hao Boyang, the main person in charge. The planned expenditure for this trip to Japan is 80,000 yuan, but it has been greatly affected by the high price of gold and has to be slightly reduced. Therefore, the current plan is 70,000 yuan. Chairman Jiang donated 10,000 yuan, Governor Zhang Xueliang of the Northeast donated 10,000 yuan, the Guangdong Provincial Government donated 10,000 yuan, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government donated 10,000 yuan. In addition, economic directors such as Liu Hongsheng and Lin Kanghou worked hard to raise funds from all sides, which was also a considerable amount. Although the funds received are not much different from the planned amount, this should also be credited to Mr. Hao's contact with all parties.</p>
<p>Chief Executive's Report: Following the chairman's report, Hao Boyang, the chief executive of the Sports Association, reported that the National Government and the governments and institutions of various provinces have worked hard to promote and help donate funds for participating in the Far Eastern Games in Japan, for which he is deeply grateful. As for the athletic talent, it is thanks to the efforts of leaders from all over the country that more than 100 national elites have been able to participate in the Far Eastern Games, which he also deeply appreciates.</p>
<p>Speeches by Guests: After the chief executive's report, the chairman introduced Lin Kanghou, Zhou Xiangxian, Zhang Yuejun (representing Chen Yiting), and Ms. Ding Shujing, who gave speeches, mainly urging the athletes to abide by sportsmanship and promote the spirit of Chinese youth in order to bring glory to the country.</p>
<p>Flag Presentation Ceremony: The directors of the Sports Association presented a flag to our country to participate in the 9th Far Eastern Games. It was exquisite and extraordinary. Mr. Chen Guangyao, a football player who has participated in the Far Eastern Games the most times and has the oldest qualifications among the athletes, was invited to receive it. Mr. Qu Wenliu, on behalf of the Board of Directors, presented the flag. Chen replied with thanks, and there was thunderous applause and three cheers.</p>
<p>Musical Performance: During and after the dinner, members of the Hengxiangshan Baseball Team performed music and dance to add to the fun. The piano music was sonorous, melodious, and full of ups and downs, and the dance was graceful and amusing, earning endless applause from the audience. Then, the whole group took a photo and dispersed at half past ten.</p>
<p>Dazzling Prizes: Four grand and magnificent prizes were displayed in the hall, dazzlingly brilliant. The chairman explained each one in detail: (1) Chairman Jiang's nine-story silver pagoda, worth approximately 2,000 yuan, symbolizes the significance of the nine Far Eastern Games that have been held. A layer will be added each time a game is held in the future. (2) Foreign Minister Wang's large silver shield. (3) The Ministry of Education's silver goblet. (4) Song Ziwen's silver tripod, all with profound meaning, to praise the victory of the Far Eastern Games.</p>
<h3>Various Organizations Prepare Today</h3>
<p>Farewell Far Eastern Athletes Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Education Bureau, the Chinese Students' Football Association, Jiaotong University, Tongji University, Labor University, Jinan University, Daxia University, Guanghua University, Fudan University, Chizhi University, Datong University, Shanghai Law and Political Science College, Shanghai Law School, Liangjiang Women's Sports School, Qixiu Girls' School, Commercial Press, China Bookstore, Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Shi Bao, Shishi Xin Bao, Min Guo Daily, China Review Weekly, Jingwu Physical Training Association, and other 24 organizations will hold a meeting tomorrow (the 13th) at 2:00 PM on the 8th floor of the Hua An Company across from the racecourse on Jingan Temple Road to send off the athletes of our country who will attend the 9th Far Eastern Games. The agenda includes speeches, refreshments, and photography. It is reported that teachers from various organizations will hold a preparatory meeting at Hua An on the 8th floor this afternoon at 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan University Sports Association Held a Regular Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Welcome Fudan to Rejoin... But Must Fulfill Conditions</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, the Jiangnan University Sports Association held its second regular meeting at the association's office. Wang Fudan was elected temporary chairman, and Wu Bangwei recorded the following resolutions:</p>
<p>(1) Because Article 9 of the constitution has different interpretations regarding the qualifications of athletes, it was discussed in detail to unify the interpretation so that all issues related to this item can be solved easily. According to the anti-side interpretation of the amateur sports qualifications in the constitution, the item "making a living by teaching or managing sports" does not currently have a provision for the restoration time, so it is naturally permanent. Therefore, before the constitution is amended to add a provision for the time limit, the association should resolve all issues according to this interpretation. In the future, a formal proposal will be made that anyone who violates one of the anti-side interpretations of Article 9 of the constitution will never be eligible to participate in the association's sports events. The discussion resulted in a passage.</p>
<p>(2) Several schools protested the qualifications of Tu Fuyue, a student from Central China University. Shi Ying proposed that it be sent back to the Athletes Qualification Review Committee for reconsideration. Its judgment is final.</p>
<p>(3) The issue of Chen Baoqiu, a student from Zhonggong, participating in the association's competition was proposed by Shi Ying to be submitted to the Athletes Qualification Review Committee for a full review. Its judgment is final.</p>
<p>(4) The issue of Fudan University's request to rejoin the association as a member was proposed by Central China University for reconsideration of the previous resolution (the previous resolution stated that if Fudan University wants to rejoin the association as a member, it must submit a letter of repentance and apologize to the association in the newspaper). The previous resolution was overturned. Then, Lin Qing proposed that since Fudan University has requested to rejoin the association as a member, the association of course welcomes it, but for all kinds of insults to the association published in the newspaper by the school in the past, the school must publish an apology to the association in the newspaper before it can join and continue to be a member of the association. The association must also publicize the process of Fudan University rejoining. The discussion resulted in a passage.</p>
<p>(5) On the amendment of the constitution, Wu Bangwei proposed to first organize a constitution amendment committee with three members. As a result, Wu Bang (chairman), Wang Fudan, and Liu Liangzhan were elected. It was also agreed that if each school has any points to amend the constitution, they can send them to Wu Bangwei at No. 24 Xintianxiang Lane, Beile Road, before May 25. The committee will discuss them after gathering them and then distribute them to each school for consideration. They will be submitted for approval at the next general meeting.</p>
<h3>Davis Cup</h3>
<p>Japan Wins Singles Match Against England</p>
<p>(Jiji Press, London, 10th) Japanese tennis player Miki competed in a singles match against British Davis Cup player Temple today. As a result, Miki won with a score of Miki 6-2 and 6-3 defeating Temple.</p>
<h3>Soochow Zhenhua Girls' Middle School Sports Meet</h3>
<p>High Jump: 1.205 Meters</p>
<p>Zhenhua Girls' School in Soochow has always promoted sports with great efforts. The sports meet held by the Soochow Women's Sports Federation suddenly changed its date, conflicting with the school's pre-scheduled prize-giving sports meet and the various training sessions on Saturday afternoons, making it difficult to change the date. The school had no choice but to withdraw, which social figures deeply regretted. Now, the track and field records of the school's inter-grade sports meet are quite impressive, and the high jump has created a new era in our country, which has been praised by people from all walks of life. The records of each item are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>50 Meters: 8 seconds</p>
<p>100 Meters: 16.5 seconds</p>
<p>Long Jump: 3.49 meters</p>
<p>High Jump: 1.205 meters</p>
<p>Shot Put: 6.96 meters</p>
<p>Triple Jump: 7.76 meters</p>
<h3>Gaoyang Gaoshang Sports Meet - Day One</h3>
<p>The Nanyang Commercial High School and the Girls' Division (Nanyang Women's High School) held a sports meet at the YMCA sports field yesterday. Because the weather was cool and it was Sunday, the number of spectators was about 2,000. In addition to all the teachers and staff of the school managing the venue, Chen De, Xu Mumin, and Zhu Feiyun also assisted in the meeting affairs. However, because the sports field was hard and the track was narrow, the results of various items were average. The various competitions yesterday were mostly preliminary rounds. The competition will continue this afternoon and will all be finals.</p>
<h3>Datong University to Hold Sports Meet</h3>
<p>On the 24th and 25th of This Month</p>
<p>The sports meet of Datong University in Southern Shanghai will be held on the 24th and 25th of this month, divided into four groups: A, B, Children, and Women.</p>
<h3>Ball Games at Municipal Ground Yesterday</h3>

As a result, Jiankang won with a score of 26 to 17. At 10:00 AM, the Municipal A and Lezhong Little Football teams played against each other. As a result, Municipal A won with a score of 3 to 2.

The variable star photographic telescope is valued at 6,000 yuan in national currency and is being purchased and manufactured by the Harvard Observatory in the United States, which is famous for its research on variable stars. After completion, the Harvard Observatory will also make corrections on behalf of the institute. The solar spectroscope is valued at over 3,000 yuan in national currency and is being negotiated and purchased by the world's largest observatory, the Mount Wilson Observatory in the United States. After completion, the Mount Wilson Observatory will also make preliminary corrections before shipping it to China, it is said.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Middle School to Host Lecture by Pan Yangyao Today</h3>
<p>Chen Jing, the principal of Jiangsu Provincial Songjiang Middle School, is actively developing the school's affairs, and all faculty and staff members are able to work together in a unified manner, which is particularly commendable. This semester, many more famous people have been invited to give lectures. However, as Songjiang is relatively far from Shanghai, it is not easy to attract them. During this visit to Shanghai by the delegation, in addition to making arrangements with the Chinese Students' Christian Association in the World's Student Christian Federation to have Mr. Wang Yingbin give a lecture, they also invited Mr. Li Zhongfan and Mr. Zhang Tianfang to give lectures locally. While at the World's Student Christian Federation, they also invited Mr. Zhu Shaoping to talk about the evolution of the press in Europe and America. Mr. Zhu also elaborated on his past experiences in running newspapers, which the students greatly appreciated. The delegation of more than 20 people returned to school yesterday, and this morning, during the memorial week, Mr. Pan Yangyao was specially invited to the school to give a lecture, providing guidance to students on higher education and employment, it is said.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Experimental Elementary Schools</h3>

You are hereby instructed to notify the school principal and to instruct the association accordingly." After receiving this order, the association believed that the organization was fundamentally shaken, and the current general meeting and exhibition have been temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Shanghai Student Association Officially Dissolved</h3>
<p>And Issues a Lengthy Declaration</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Secondary and Higher Education Students' Association was formally established last November after a meeting of student representatives from across the city. The members, entrusted with the spirit of the May Fourth Movement by the students of the city, worked actively to revive the student movement. However, with the central government's principle of limiting student movements to within the school, the association suffered a major blow, fundamentally lost its position, and faced numerous difficulties. Although it wanted to maintain itself, it was unable to do so. Therefore, after a second joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, it was decided that all members would resign from their positions to the students of the city and issue a declaration detailing all the difficulties encountered.</p>
<h3>City Education Bureau Calls Meetings with Elementary School Principals in Stages</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau yesterday issued separate instructions to municipal and registered private elementary schools in the city, calling for meetings with principals in stages. The dates are listed below: (1) Municipal school principals and attached elementary school directors in the South Shanghai District, 2:00 PM on May 17; (2) Municipal elementary school principals in the Zhabei District, 2:00 PM on May 18; (3) Municipal elementary school principals in the Yangjing, Tangqiao, Caojing, Pusong, Yinxiang, Fahua, and Zhenru districts, 10:00 AM on May 25; (4) Municipal elementary school principals in the Yangsi, Gaohang, Luhang, Gaoqiao, Pengpu, Wusong, Jiangwan, and Yinhang districts, 2:00 PM on May 25; (5) Principals of registered private elementary schools and directors of attached elementary schools of registered private middle schools in the urban area, 2:00 PM on May 21.</p>
<h3>City Education Bureau Orders Schools to Instruct Students on Labor, Hygiene, and Safety</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Bureau of Education yesterday issued a circular to all middle and elementary schools in the city, stating: "In order to ensure compliance, it is hereby noted that rotating students to be responsible for cleaning and sweeping classrooms is originally intended to enable students to practice diligence and cultivate good habits, and to bring schools closer to social life. The intention is good and the method is excellent. However, if not implemented properly, it can lead to drawbacks. For example, inhaling dust from wiping blackboards or sweeping the floor can easily lead to lung diseases. Climbing on window ledges to clean glass can cause minor skin injuries or, more seriously, lead to falls and endanger lives. All of these should be carefully noted. Hereafter, when students sweep and clean after class, teachers and staff members must be present to provide guidance and teach appropriate methods in advance. For example, use a damp cloth to wipe blackboards first and sprinkle water before sweeping to avoid dust and dirt flying in the air. Cleaning windows and heavy work should be done by school workers. Teachers and staff members are responsible for supervising students at school. This matter concerning student health should be taken seriously and no negligence should be allowed. This order is hereby issued to all middle and elementary schools for compliance."</p>
<h3>Educators from the Capital to Japan to Study Education</h3>
<p>Departing at 2 PM Today; Jin Guobao and Wang Zhixin to Study Economics</p>
<p>In recent years, Japan's education sector has progressed rapidly, which is quite astounding. Many educators from our country have gone to Japan to study.

<h3>Wang Yingbin Lectures on the Outline of Journalism</h3>
<p>The Chinese Students' Christian Association in the World's Student Christian Federation on Carter Road invited Mr. Wang Yingbin, a well-known figure in the press, to the association yesterday at 7 PM to lecture on the "Outline of Journalism." In addition to members of the association and students from over ten universities in the city, over twenty students from the senior high school journalism program of Jiangsu Provincial Songjiang Middle School, led by teacher Li Bangshu, also attended the lecture. Mr. Zhu Shaoping presided over the meeting, delivered an introductory speech, and distributed two printed materials made by Mr. Wang: "On Journalists" and "Journalist's Creed" by Dr. Walter Williams, dean of the School of Journalism at the University of Missouri. Then, Mr. Wang began his lecture, stating that the "Outline of Journalism" can be divided into the following categories: (1) The scope of newspapers can include daily newspapers, weekly publications, monthly publications, specialized publications, and other propaganda publications. The principle of newspapers is to disseminate facts and guide opinion, and anything that meets this principle falls within the scope of newspapers. (2) The skills of newspapers: 1. News gathering and editing require clear judgment and discernment; 2. Commentary should be based on the trend of public opinion, not on subjective opinions. (3) Advertising has a great relationship with commercial development and the improvement of life. Advertisers should have the spirit of serving commerce and improving life. (4) Distribution: The speed of newspaper transportation and the promotion of sales are the responsibilities of the distributors, so distribution is also a specialized skill. (5) Machinery: The quality of the printing press and the clarity of the typefaces are related to distribution, the transmission of telegrams is related to news, and photographs and illustrations are related to advertising, all of which need to be improved from time to time. As for the economics of newspapers and the writing of newspapers, there are special points. Finally, he raised issues such as the ethics of the newspaper industry and elaborated on them in detail. After the lecture, the audience stood up to thank Mr. Wang and then dispersed. The students from Songjiang Middle School then talked with Mr. Zhu Shaoping in another room, where Mr. Zhu described his experiences with newspapers and his opinions on newspapers. The meeting adjourned around 10 PM.</p>
<h3>Zhijiang University Shanghai Alumni Association Launches Fundraising Campaign to Build Library</h3>
<p>The Zhijiang University Shanghai Alumni Association held a fundraising campaign to build a library for its alma mater at a gathering on the 8th floor of the Hua An Building on the evening of the 10th. A total of 100 people attended. The chairman and chief captain, Chen Dezheng, delivered an opening speech, stating that libraries are a transformed university, a place for university students to conduct academic research, and a source of cultural nourishment. Although Zhejiang has a library, it is not sufficient for university students' reference, except for a collection of valuable books. The alma mater is the only private university in both Zhejiang provinces, with a long history and a constant stream of talented individuals. However, the lack of a library prevents it from being called a complete university. The alumni association, having received several years of education from the alma mater, should think of its origins and leave a memorial for the alma mater. Constructing a library is the most appropriate and completing the mission in the shortest possible time is a very important responsibility. He hoped that the students present would work hard together to achieve the goal. Next, Minister Kong Xiangxi, a member of the board of directors, delivered a speech stating that private universities in our country have made considerable achievements and contributions in history, culture, and politics. The development of private universities in the United States is clear evidence of this. In recent years, the school atmosphere has gradually tended towards "not reading books" but focusing on "living on campus," the so-called junior high school, high school, and university completing the full number of years before graduating. Chinese students are "living on campus," while American students are reading books, not only wanting to read books within the curriculum but also wanting to read books outside the curriculum, wanting to do their own research. Research requires a library. Without a library, how can students conduct research? The students of Zhijiang University understand this point and have launched a fundraising campaign to build a library, which truly demonstrates their vision and can achieve the concept of "school as family." He hoped that the students would work hard to complete the goal and set a good example for other universities. Next, Deputy Captain Wu Wenwei reported that the alumni association's fundraising campaign to build a library is the beginning of assisting the alma mater. Female dormitories, science halls, etc., can also be completed one by one. Then, former President Fei Peide and current President Li Peien, as well as Wang Dazhang, a member of the fundraising committee, delivered speeches in succession. The various teams then held group meetings before adjourning at 11 PM.</p>
<h3>Meeting Minutes of the Shanghai Middle School Alumni Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Shanghai Middle School Alumni Association of this city and province held its third general meeting at the high school library of the school yesterday morning at 9 AM. All alumni present unanimously elected Mr. Zhu Jiarang as chairman. First, the chairman delivered an opening speech and made a general report on the association's affairs. Shen Yizhen and Zhang Zhongbao gave earnest speeches seeking guidance. Then, the discussion and resolution of the following proposals began: (1) Urge alumni in various regions to organize branch associations as soon as possible; (2) Stipulate grouping methods; (3) Confirm that the new alumni membership fee is one yuan and the regular membership fee is four jiao; (4) Publish publications to communicate news and other important matters. The meeting then broke for refreshments and lunch before adjourning.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>A Laughing Matter, by Hai Ke</p>
<p>Doctor: Your husband is now out of danger and will not die.</p>
<p>Wife of the Patient: But three days ago, didn't you say that he would definitely die within ten days?</p>
<p>Doctor: Yes, but my medical skills are so high that I have saved him and he is gradually recovering.</p>
<p>Wife of the Patient: Oh, sir, what am I going to do? I pawned all my clothes and jewelry to get money to prepare his burial clothes and coffin!</p>
<p>Judge (to the accused): How old are you this year?</p>
<p>Accused: I don't know.</p>
<p>Judge: Then when were you born?</p>
<p>Accused: Why are you asking about my age and birthday? Are you going to give me a birthday gift? No need to be polite, no need to be polite.</p>
<p>Wife: Look, Japan is not a very big country. How could it defeat that huge Russia in the beginning?</p>
<p>Husband: Dear, but you yourself are not very big, and I am much bigger than you. Why am I always being subjugated by you?</p>
<p>Woman A: Today, I went to see a cosmetic surgeon and asked him what methods he had to make my face always look young.</p>
<p>Woman B: What did he say?</p>
<p>Woman A: He told me to always be with ladies who are twenty years older than me, and naturally I would feel young.</p>
<h3>Japanese Women's Opinions on Marriage</h3>
<p>By Qiushui</p>
<p>According to a recent report from Kobe, a marriage question test meeting was recently held there. 2,638 women, all graduates of women's high schools in the same location, participated. The questions are worth referencing for sociologists, so I will describe them below:</p>
<p>Very few wish to remain single. The first question of this test was: Do you want to get married? The answer was that 2,479 people wanted to get married, and only 36 said that marriage was uninteresting and wished to remain single. Thus, it can be seen that the union of men and women is a natural instinct. Without incitement or other special reasons, marriage is essential for human beings. I wonder how many tragic events are contained in the love histories of these 36 people.</p>
<p>Listen more to parents' opinions when choosing a husband. The second question was: Should you choose a husband based on your parents' wishes or your own? The answers can be divided into three factions. The first faction, the most numerous, answered that marriage should be determined by parents' orders and matchmakers' words, totaling 753 people. The second faction advocated marrying someone they loved, totaling 181 people. The second faction was a compromise, saying that parents have the final say in the marriage decision, but it is okay to propose several potential husbands for parents to decide, totaling 1,480 people. From this observation, it can be seen that these Japanese women, although having been exposed to Western new ideas, still have a majority who retain the old concepts of their country. The Japanese's adherence to old ways can be imagined.</p>
<p>Need government employees to be husbands. The third question was even more interesting, asking what kind of husband you hope to marry. The majority of answers said that they wished to marry employees of the government or commercial institutions with a fixed salary, totaling 981 people. Teachers were second, with 207 supporters. Military officers were next, with 129 supporters (Note: There is a place in Japan called Hima, where the 10th Division of the army is stationed. The power of the military is extremely great. At a similar marriage question test held there, the majority of answers wished to marry military officers). Other professions, such as journalists, were largely ignored, presumably because their work is mostly at night and there is little company under the boudoir lamp, so journalists may lament that they have no romantic luck. Also, aviation is the most developed industry in Japan in recent years, but in this test, only one person wanted to marry an aviator, which is quite strange.</p>
<p>Japanese women are good at managing household affairs. The fourth question was: What business will you do after marriage? The answer was that 958 people said they would manage household affairs, 208 people said they would still like to study, 521 people wanted to seek employment, and 111 people said they hoped to engage in the work they loved. Japanese women are good at managing household affairs, which is quite similar to women in our country. The theme can also be seen in this answer.</p>
<h3>Capital Newspaper Vendors Walking on Thin Ice</h3>
<p>I have been working in the capital and often travel between Xiaguan and Pukou. Because I like reading newspapers, I have been interacting with newspaper vendors. After a year, I have become acquainted with quite a few of them, so I am recording their trivial matters to provide some talking points. The capital area is quite large, and newspapers from Shanghai usually arrive around 4 PM. After the newspaper vendors pick them up, they are distributed to readers as quickly as possible, usually around 4:30 PM. However, if you live in the city, it is usually around 6 PM before they arrive. But recently, several newspaper vendors have switched to using cars to distribute newspapers because walking takes too long. So, as soon as the Shanghai newspapers arrive, they drive off in different directions. Therefore, one can often see a large number of cars speeding along Zhongshan Road. As a result, city residents can now read newspapers before 5 PM.</p>
<p>As far as I know, the oldest newspaper vendor is a Mr. Xu. According to him, he started delivering newspapers when he was in his thirties and has not stopped since, even though he is now over fifty years old. This old man is in good spirits and walks very well. What is even more commendable is that he has never asked anyone to deliver newspapers for him, even in wind and rain, and he is never late. He once told me that the people who subscribe to his newspapers have been doing so for ten years, and he has never heard any complaints, unlike young newspaper vendors who often break their promises. He can almost be called the most senior newspaper vendor in the capital.</p>
<p>Another side business of newspaper vendors is to collect old newspapers and resell them for profit. They can earn about five to ten cents per pound of newspapers. According to one newspaper vendor, he can get one silver dollar for a complete, unblemished "Free Talk" or "Happy Forest" in a month. If that is the case, then the income of newspaper vendors is quite considerable.</p>
<h3>A Small Record of a Party by Xiao Qi</h3>
<p>Last night, the entire class of 1921 from Jiaotong University in this city held a grand tea party to celebrate the completion of the class meeting and to strengthen relationships. There were many interesting things during the party, so I will describe one or two to contribute to this publication.</p>
<p>The venue was filled with the breath of spring. The meeting was held in the solemn and grand Wen Zhi Hall. At 7 PM, the classmates entered one after another, and for a while, laughter and witty remarks were heard everywhere. This was because the Jiaotong University's coursework is繁 (fán - busy/complicated) so there are very few such grand gatherings on weekdays. So now that everyone is talking in the hall, it is bound to add many impressions in the coming years.</p>
<p>Western music was frequently played, and there were many entertainment programs. Among them, Western music accounted for half of the performance. Some played the violin, some played the piano, some played the piccolo, and some sang long songs. All were brilliant and astonishing, and the shouts of "encore" from the audience below became almost customary. The performers were also grateful for the classmates' good intentions and gladly made a second appearance on stage.</p>
<p>During Al Jolson's performance, the chairman suddenly introduced in English that Mr. Al Jolson from the United States had been specially invited to play music here today and that Mr. Jolson was the main character in the most famous "The Jazz Singer," etc. The audience was very surprised for a while. Before long, Al Jolson came to the stage with black greasepaint on his face, performing a passage from "The Jazz Singer," which was extremely sad and moving. After it was over, the reporter approached him and asked. Only then did he learn that this Mr. Al Jolson was actually the classmate Chen Zhensheng in disguise. It can be called divine.</p>
<p>Boss Huang Sings. After Al Jolson's performance, it was followed by Boss Huang's solo singing. The reporter is also not familiar with his name, only knowing that he specializes in old operas, so he has the name of Boss Huang.</p>
<h3>Yizheng Three Days Diary (3) A Record by Xie, Leader of the National Walking Group</h3>
<p>We then went to the Public Tea House to sip tea and were satisfied with the Emerald Roasted Treasures, a delicacy of Zhenzhou. Other places do not have this, and even if they do, they certainly cannot compare to this. After chatting for about two hours, we were led by the gentlemen to Tianning Temple. The abbot, Sun Shaowen, accompanied us directly to the monks' quarters to visit the monk Liaoyuan, but we did not find him. I could not help but feel a sense of being near and yet far. Fortunately, we met the retired abbot of the temple, Lai Nian, and chatted with him about Chan Buddhist principles. His breadth of mind made me admire him. Alas, to give rise to the mind without dwelling on anything, to empty the appearance without attachment. I am thirty-five years old. I have neither benefited my family nor my country above, nor have I made up for society below. Years have passed like the sun rising, building up nothing, and my ice-removing karma has become heavy. Since I cannot uplift others, I should seek self-upliftment. Now, I am not even uplifting myself, but instead, I am taking this action of drifting with the tide. I do not know how I will end up. Ashamed of my worldliness, I did not dare to defile the pure and noble, so I took my leave. We then visited the Relief Home. Inside the home were several elderly men, widowers, and orphans, as well as over ten elderly women and more than twenty orphaned girls. The organization of the home regarding all relief matters is extremely complete. In my opinion, other relief organizations are merely in name only. If relief work could be carried out everywhere as it is in Yizheng, then the Principle of People's Livelihood could be realized and the people's livelihood would truly have something to rely on. At this time, the setting sun was touching the corners of the roofs, and the weary birds had already returned to their nests. We took our leave and then visited the Public Education Center. The center is located at the Drum Tower. Here, we only saw (the Drum Tower was the South Gate of the county seat in the Song Dynasty, called Ningjiang Gate. Later, because the county seat was expanded, it was changed to the Drum Tower). The center is divided into four sections, meticulously designed, and includes a public club for the local business, industrial, and academic communities to use for entertainment during their leisure time. Although the scale is not large, those in charge are very thoughtful. People like Mr. Zhao are worthy of being called guides for public education. We then took our leave and returned to our residence to rest. The time for the banquet had arrived, and the entire group went to Magistrate Tian's banquet. The banquet was set up inside the Relief Home, and the executive members of the county party headquarters, Gong Kuishi, Chen Kaiming, and Pan Wensan, arrived one after another. Here, we also saw that Magistrate Tian was able to integrate the party and the local affairs into one, and his spirit and thoughts were all concentrated, which is as different as heaven and earth from other places where each governs their own affairs. The banquet ended at 10 p.m. At Mr. Gong's invitation, we would all participate in the second anniversary of the founding of Nanjing the next morning, the 18th. So, we bid farewell and returned, and after tidying up a bit and working on drafts from the day, it was past one o'clock before we went to bed.</p>
<p>On that day, two songs were sung, with quite a Tan-style flavor. It was asked whether it was a rare find, and the audience responded with a stage full of colored newspapers.</p>
<p>The Shy Shot Put King Keeps the National Record - Lu Ming, the shot put king who also belonged to the same class, was also there that day. Everyone teased him to sing Peking opera, and at first, he refused. Later, he refused to go on stage, but eventually, he went on stage. However, his face was directly facing the portrait of the Premier, ignoring the audience. The shy shot put king ultimately aroused a lot of laughter from the audience.</p>
<h3>Interesting Anecdotes of the Stone Turtle with a Severed Head - Lü Bing</h3>
<p>Outside the Xingzhong Gate of the capital, there is a village called Huilong, where the residents are densely packed and the houses are tall and spacious. In the past, there was a temple here, but it was demolished long ago. Only a huge stone tablet still stands majestically, nearly two zhang high and more than a foot thick. The characters are vaguely discernible, and upon reading them, it is clear that they were made in the fourteenth year of Yongle in the Ming Dynasty to worship the water god. Now, the ruins have been changed to build Western-style buildings, but the ancient stele remains, probably because this object is too heavy to move easily. The base of the stele is supported by a stone turtle, which is larger than usual. The area of the turtle's back is enough to抵食桌抵食桌 two dining tables. The head is raised, and the image is lifelike. What is even stranger is that there is a candlestick and incense burner placed in front of the turtle. Superstitious people nearby say that the turtle has spiritual power. Every year in the spring, many people bring paper and incense to the turtle to prostrate themselves and worship. This kind of behavior is not worth the smile of those who are knowledgeable. The other day, the regular period came again, and women still went as usual. For a time, the incense in front of the stone turtle's head in Huilong Village swirled, forming a strange phenomenon. Unexpectedly, with a sudden sound, the head of this stone turtle, which was worshiped by people, completely separated from its body. The news spread, causing even more crowds to come from far and near to watch. There was nothing strange about the turtle's head falling off, except that some red stripes appeared on the cracked area, probably caused by years of incense and smoke. However, superstitious people still scrambled to pick up the fragments, saying that they could ward off evil spirits, which can be said to be obsessed. Now that science is flourishing, gods and monsters should have disappeared long ago. This turtle is a symbol of superstition, but now it has broken itself without needing to be broken. Since it is something that was witnessed, I have described it as a true story so that readers may be able to use it as a conversation piece.</p>

<h3>Warmth in My Heart (1) (9) (0) Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Jade Ornaments and Pearl Hairpins, A Beautiful Woman Marries a Talented Man; Azure Chamber and Crimson Canopy, A Famous Courtesan Marries into a Prominent Family.</p>
<p>In less than an hour, the carriages sent to pick them up came one after another. Of course, they were uneven because when they took the bureau tickets and sent the carriages to pick them up, they had not notified them in advance. At that time, there were not as many telephones installed in Shanghai's brothels as there are now. And the most unfair thing was that even if the Qu Yuan installed telephones, they were not allowed to be listed in the telephone directory. Occasionally, the numbers that were listed had the words "What and what restaurant" printed below. When asked why they didn't list them in the directory even though they had installed telephones, they were also at a loss. Probably the person who reported the installation of the telephone did so because a telephone was often shared by several families, and it was difficult to decide which family to register it under. Moreover, in Shanghai's brothels, the term of a section of the month was one ending, and often one or two sections would have to be changed. After the change, the name of the telephone owner had to be changed again. It was often too much trouble to correct the telephone book. In fact, if you wanted to install a telephone alone, Shanghai's brothels were open for business, and there was nothing wrong with it. Just look at the telephone books of Beiping and Tianjin, and you can find them on the pages about the "Yingying Yanyan" women. Because the names of the courtesans in the brothels were not listed in the telephone book, a group of small speculators later printed a special telephone book that listed the names of the people in the brothels. People in this circle called it a small telephone book, which was very convenient for those who were indulging in sensual pleasures, as they could consult it like a map. That day, since they had not notified them by telephone in advance, and it was also the time when the courtesans were singing, they first picked up those who did not have performances outside. There were also those who knew where Yi's performance was and could bring the bureau tickets to wait there. Those who were busy with their performances could only say that their own carriages would come. It seemed very far from Fuzhou Road to Zhang's Garden because the road was not used to walking on. In fact, it was not very far. Some called their own carriages, and they always did so when they went to distant performances. Of course, there was a particularly cheap one. Some were their own chartered cars. They were originally very light, and the chartered cars in Sanwantou were pushed and pulled by two drivers, who were as fast as flying and even faster than carriages. After an hour, there were only three or five courtesans on each table, hiding and whispering among themselves. The gongs and drums on the stage started, but the courtesans had also become those who were only in the brothel and not singing. They took this opportunity to watch the show. Some girls who liked to watch the show would stick to the courtesans and refuse to leave until Mei Lanfang came on stage before they would go back. Therefore, there was a cluster of flowers, but only their arrival was seen and not their departure. A sound of "Sister" and "Aunt" calling was heard.</p>
<p>Readers of "Warmth in My Heart," your enlightened instruction is received. In Chapter Eleven, "Jade Ornaments and Pearl Hairpins, A Famous Courtesan Marries a Talented Man," the word "媛 (yuan)," meaning 'beautiful woman', is a deflected tone and should be changed. According to research, "媛" can also be a level tone, collected in the thirteenth rhyme of the upper level tone, "元 (yuan)," meaning a beautiful woman, which is the same as the "霰 (xian)" rhyme. But now that the title has been changed like this, I don't know what you think. (Tianxiao)</p>

<h3>Public Bonds on the Securities Market Fluctuated Last Week</h3>
<p>The market was flat, with a transaction volume of over 34.2 million.</p>
<p>Last week, the public bond market in this city, except for Friday, when the market was closed due to the 5/9 incident, the futures market was flat as before. The most active day was Monday, with a transaction volume of approximately 11.5 million. The situation was still good between Tuesday and Wednesday, with each day reaching 6-7 million yuan. On Thursday, it suddenly became extremely deserted, and the buyers and sellers were very quiet. The volume opened at 200,000-300,000 yuan in a day, and the quietness of the market was rare in recent times. On the last day of the weekend, the market did not show any signs of change, and the transaction volume was only over 5.8 million. The total transaction volume for the entire week was 34.24 million yuan, a decrease of over 4.4 million yuan compared with the previous week. Among them, the customs tax accounted for the largest amount, with 5.765 million yuan for the May period and 6.47 million yuan for the June period. Reorganization ranked second, with 3.005 million yuan for the May period and 3.21 million yuan for the June period. The sixth reorganization was next, with 2.075 million yuan for the May period and 3.01 million yuan for the June period. Post-settlement was 2.165 million yuan for the May period and 2.465 million yuan for the June period. Other debts were also low, such as the extended fifth issue, with 1.015 million yuan for the May period and 1.03 million yuan for the June period. The extended bond was 965,000 yuan for the May period and 700,500 yuan for the June period. The troop reduction was 255,000 yuan for the May period and 975,000 yuan for the June period. The 9/6 public bond was 445,000 yuan for the May period and 435,000 yuan for the June period. The financial seven-year bonds were even scarcer, with a total of 135,000 yuan for the financial bonds and only 115,000 yuan for the seven-year bonds. The spot market was even quieter, with only 71,600 yuan for the entire week, of which reorganization accounted for 39,300 yuan, and customs tax and post-settlement each accounted for 9,000 yuan. The sixth reorganization and the seven-year bonds were only 4,000-5,000 yuan each, and the others were only several thousand yuan. As for the price changes of each bond over the past week, the market was weak on Monday due to the tense political situation, and the prices fell sharply in the morning sessions, with the price of reorganization falling by nearly 2 yuan, and other bonds also falling by about 1 yuan. Later, the market stabilized slightly, and investors and buyers became more active, rebounding slightly. However, the results were still lower than the previous week, falling by 0.4-1 yuan. On Tuesday, the seven-year, extended, financial, and 9/6 bonds were relatively stable, while other bonds rose across the board as the political situation stabilized slightly and the market was in good spirits. On Wednesday, customs tax and reorganization continued to fall by 0.8-0.9 yuan, and although other bonds also tended to weaken, the amount was only several jiao. In the following two days, the bond market was chaotic and the market sentiment was uncertain. Although each bond rose or fell, the trend was peaceful, and there were no major fluctuations in the daily trading. Compared with the previous weekend, only the extended, financial troop reduction bonds shrank slightly. The reorganization spot price fell sharply, while other spot prices rose by 0.4-1 yuan. The following is a statistical list of the high and low price fluctuations of each bond over the past week (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Last Week's Yarn Market Was Neither Glorious Nor Disgraceful</h3>
<p>Standard transaction volume of 33,050 bales, with 11,280 bales of spot goods opened.</p>
<p>The yarn market showed an unusually weak trend at the beginning of the week, with a risk of decline. The war clouds in the Central Plains were dense, and overseas cotton yarn showed a consistent downward trend. The actual sales of downstream buyers were not very smooth. The market sentiment softened, and many scattered households were looking at 50 taels of imported cotton. Also, because it was the busy season for silkworm farmers, there were many who tended to sell. However, major buyers and a certain factory have always refused to let go. Therefore, although the environment was bad, the market did not experience a major breakdown. The entire week was neither glorious nor disgraceful. At the end of the week, Hengda Trading sold more than 2,800 bales of ten branches (standard unsalable goods) of Peacock yarn to the Guangdong group at a low price, which relieved the bulls of some burden. The market sentiment turned tighter, and the scattered households cleared their positions, and the market price rebounded by more than 1 tael. Therefore, the current situation is unlikely to see a major fall. Also, according to the customs records, the export volume of cotton yarn last month was more than 80,000 bales, not including small domestic bales. The total production of the entire city of Shanghai is estimated at about 90,000 bales per month. With such a huge sales volume, the inventory of various factories has decreased (estimated to be about 100,000 bales). In short, the yarn market is affected by the war, and traffic on various routes is blocked. In addition, the current price of rice is too high, and the purchasing power of various groups is weak. The yarn price of 152-153 taels seems to have the possibility of stabilization. If the autumn harvest is abundant and the military situation is peaceful, the future should see an upward trend. Otherwise, there is a risk of long-term consolidation. The Guangdong and Sichuan groups bought the most. In addition, the current sales were flat. The total statistics of the various groups that bought for the entire week were 11,280 bales. The price of domestic yarn was stable, and the price of Japanese yarn fell slightly. The domestic firms bought 2,400 bales. The transaction volume of standard futures yarn on the exchange did not increase significantly, so the trading was particularly quiet. The price of each month was 1 tael and 2 qian higher in the near term and 0.7-0.8 qian higher in the far term compared with the previous week. The total transaction volume for the entire week was 33,050 bales. The Osaka three products also tended to fall. The following is a record of the amount bought by each group:</p>
<p>Group Number Group Number Group Number</p>
<p>Domestic Firms 2,400 Shantou 300 Fujian 150</p>
<p>Sichuan 3,100 Wuhu 50 Xiamen 205</p>
<p>Guangdong 5,515 Xuzhou 160 Miscellaneous Firms 500</p>
<p>Domestic 810 Niuzhuang 230 Yunnan 260</p>
<h3>Last Week's Cotton Market Had a Latent Soft Appearance</h3>
<p>Henan Standard, East Cotton was Shorted, and the Near-Month Raw Cotton, Jardine Matheson purchased in large quantities.</p>
<p>The cotton market showed a rather soft appearance last week. The overseas market was lifeless, and the price fluctuations were mixed, leading to market anxiety. It was heard that the goods received last month in East Cotton would be transferred to this month, so the scattered households panicked, and the market situation this month became increasingly loose. The distant month was more firm, because the attitude of the Henan group has always refused to let go, because the bottom goods are weaker than last year, and there is not much inventory in the Henan market, and the market price is high, so the idea of ​​being long on futures is very strong. The various factories absorb enough local cotton to print, but there is no large amount of transactions. Only Jardine Matheson, a British factory, purchased a lot, and according to some rumors, the goods of Indian cotton that have been shipped in the past few days are not in good condition, and the color is dull, so there is a change to purchase local cotton. At present, there is no major change. The bid price this month is 0.2 qian lower than last week, and the distant month is 0.015 qian higher. The total statistics for the entire week were 120,200 dan. The source on the dock counted 2,400 bales of Yao cotton and 1,600 bales of Tong cotton. The manufacturer's import counted 26,610 dan, and the firm's import was 2,888 dan. The American cotton rose by 0.15 pounds compared with the previous week. The following is a list of the amount bought by each manufacturer and firm:</p>
<p>Manufacturer Import Highest Price Lowest Price Transaction Volume Term</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 37.50 35.2 16,000 pieces Spot Goods Sent to Factory</p>
<p>Taicang Cotton 36.75 1,000 dan Another</p>
<p>American Cotton 45.75 15 pieces Another</p>
<p>Pingjiaer 32.00 100 pieces Another</p>
<p>Tijian Cotton 36.00 200 bales Spot Goods Sent to Changzhou</p>
<p>Pudong Cotton 36.00 200 bales Also sent to Suzhou</p>
<p>Firm Import</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 36.25 35.25 400 pieces Spot Goods Delivered to Warehouse</p>
<p>Long-staple Cotton 44.75 160 pieces Another</p>
<p>American Cotton 45.00 43.25 200 pieces Another</p>
<h3>Silk Tea Last Week's Silk Market Was Lonely and Spiritless</h3>
<p>Overseas Silk Telegram Did Not Turn ··· European Firms Were Watching</p>
<p>The silk market in this city was increasingly lonely last week. The sluggish silk sales in Europe and America were rare during the new cocoon season. Overseas demand did not pick up, and the telegrams after sending out the old and new silks did not turn around. European firms were watching even more. New cocoons in Jinhua and Yuhang, Zhejiang Province, have been listed. The cocoon production is at most only 60-70%. Cocoon companies have opened their scales one after another. The market arrival is not large, and the cocoon price is rising. High-quality goods are 55-60 yuan, and ordinary cocoons are 45-50 yuan. New sample cocoons have been shipped to Shanghai, and the cocoon costs are difficult to expect to be low. The price of silk in Europe and America has plummeted, and the Yokohama Japanese silk inventory is still unable to be disposed of, making Chinese silk merchants even more saddened. In the middle of the week, more than 800 bales of old silk were shipped out. It was also during the spring horse racing season in Shanghai. The silk trading volume for the entire week was only more than 100 bales. The overseas silk price was obviously flat and secretly weak due to the exchange rate increase. The following is a list of the market prices of Chinese silk in the European and American markets at the end of last week (New York price per yard, unit: gold dollar · Lyon price per kilogram, unit: franc).</p>
<p>Silk Type New York Lyon Silk Type New York Lyon</p>
<p>High-grade Shanghai Warp 5.27 349 Top-grade Dried Warp 3.25 220</p>
<p>Top-grade Shanghai Warp 4.75 295 Medium-grade Dried Warp 2.80 164</p>
<p>Medium-grade Shanghai Warp 4.17 228 Low-grade Dried Warp 2.25 127</p>

<p>Top-grade Sichuan Warp 4.33 237 Top-grade White Silk 1.80 113</p>
<p>Top-grade Gray Warp 1.95 125</p>
<h3>New Sample Cocoons from Zhejiang and Hangzhou Have Been Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>More than 100 catties of half-dried cocoons ··· Jiucheng and other factories have been paid to test the Zhejiang and Hangzhou cocoon markets. The new cocoons in Pingyao and other places in Yuhang have been listed early. Gonghexin Yu and other new and old cocoon companies have opened their scales. On the first day, the price of ordinary cocoons was 40-45 yuan, and the price of high-quality cocoons was 50 yuan. On the second day, because the arrival of cocoons in the market was not strong, the price of high-quality cocoons rose to 55-56 yuan. Yesterday, the price rose to 58-60 yuan. The new sample cocoons have been shipped to Shanghai, a total of more than 100 catties of half-dried cocoons, which are the goods of Jiucheng and other factories in West Shanghai. They have now been paid to the factory for trial reeling to see the quality of Zhejiang cocoons this year. The second batch of cocoons will arrive in Shanghai around the middle of the month.</p>
<h3>Snippets of Information About Tea from Anhui and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Wuyuan new tea is affected by excessive rain. Since the Wuyi new tea was采採 picked, it has been raining every day. The tea leaves are growing very fast. Many tea farmers expect the tea production this year to be lacking. To save money, they mostly hire temporary workers. Unexpectedly, the weather is not sunny, and they are all suffering from insufficient picking and production. Yesterday, the families added more male and female tea workers to rush to pick, fearing that the old leaves would grow old. Also, the labor and firewood costs have doubled, and the cost for mountain households has to be increased compared with previous years. If the weather does not clear, it will take ten days to close the garden.</p>
<p>The Dexing tea market is suspended due to bandit troubles. In the Dexing new tea bandit-free areas, they rushed to pick and sell as early as ten days ago. Two tea shops in Haikou also opened. The tea market gradually turned to life. But now, because the communist bandits are wandering around De County and approaching Haikou, the residents of the neighboring tea-producing villages have moved away one after another and cannot pick tea. Yongtailong, the Wuyi gang tea shop in Dexing City, has now moved back to Wuyuan to open a shop. Tea merchants from various places are hesitant to go, and the opening of the tea market has been suspended.</p>
<p>The price of Qifu black tea market has fallen sharply. The picking of Qifu black tea has been going on for more than ten days. Because the weather is cloudy and rainy, the shipment is not strong. Fortunately, the weather cleared yesterday. The mountain farmers are still rushing to pick. Because there is sunlight to dry the leaves, the tea is better than before. It will take about a week to close the garden. The tea shop could not open early because the Hekou Division had not arrived. Now that the tea divisions have rushed to rescue and the numbers have been opened together to search. The mountain price has fallen sharply. The first-class new tea is offered at 50 to 24-25 yuan per dan. The second-class is only 30 to 20 yuan, which is almost half less than the previous year. The first-class teas of each shop have been collected, and now the second and third batches are being continued. However, this year the mountain price can be so low because the tea leaves of each shop contain too much water, and the first discount and aroma are also inferior, and the funds are not smooth, so they all cut the price. If it is not cheap, they will not buy. The mountain farmers think that the number of tea shops has decreased this year, and the supply exceeds the demand. It is difficult to buy strange goods and they are still willing to sell at a low price to avoid being left out. For this reason, the mountain price cannot rebound, and it may still tend to fall.

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Continues to be Dull</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than ten boats arrived at Zhabei Inner Road. The goods piled up in the river were still sufficient for the market. Higher-quality rice sold quickly, while lower-quality rice remained stagnant. Fresh Northern粳 rice sold the best. Old and long-stored rice, even of high quality, was not popular due to concerns about discoloration after purchase. Therefore, prices fluctuated slightly. Late rice has long been in a dull state. Sales to customers are slow, and supplies are scarce, resulting in a uniform stagnation. Both sheep and Duzi fragrant rice are influenced by imported rice. Various parties are not paying attention. Although the overall market is stable, there are no brisk transactions. The market has been stagnant for a long time. Wooden boat rice is slightly inquired about, but its price is affected by the dullness of the 粳 rice market, resulting in lower bids from buyers and a sluggish trend.</p>
<p>Approximately ten boats arrived at South Shanghai River. Sales in this area varied. Buyers are only focusing on high-quality rice, so Changzhou, Wuxi and Northern粳 rice are being promoted. Prices remained stable. Rice from Suzhou and Tongxiang is also being inquired about because the price is relatively low. However, the market in the north is flat, making it difficult to make progress here. Transactions in early rice from Southern帮 continue to be quiet. Only top-quality rice is selling, and prices for high-quality rice are stable, while medium-quality rice is weakening. Duzi fragrant rice and sheep fragrant rice remain unchanged. Most sales are focused on imported rice, and local fragrant rice is being rejected due to a lack of goods. Sales of white yuan rice are slow, and the market is even flatter.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News: More Than 300 Pieces of Woolen Textiles Shipped from London to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 2,500 tons of Dutch sugar and 800 pieces of Indian burlap arrived. 30,000 bags of Siamese rice will arrive soon. Today, 2,000 boxes of tea were imported. Yesterday, 400 pieces of lake silk were shipped to Europe and transported to France.</p>

<h3>Silk Factories Affected by Expensive Coal</h3>
<p>The coal used by silk factories in this area has always been contracted by coal companies. Last year, each silk machine required about 21.2 fen of silver per day for coal expenses. This year, due to the high price of gold and the low price of silver, and the sharp rise in the Japanese exchange rate, the price of Japanese coal has increased by 20-30%. Shandong is the largest coal-producing province in China, but recently, due to difficult transportation, the coal in Shanghai has run out, and the supply cannot meet the demand. The price has also soared. This year, coal companies are quoting prices of 27-28 fen per day for each factory's coal consumption after the new silkworm cocoons are on the market, and they are unwilling to contract. The cost of raw silk for each bale will increase by more than ten taels, and manufacturers are generally pessimistic.</p>

Other districts are still lacking. It is urgent to plan for construction and once planned to implement a long-distance telephone plan for the entire county in the shortest possible time to connect all districts in order to facilitate all sectors of society. After the plan was drafted, it was submitted to the Construction Department for review, but it was instructed to postpone construction. Wu Wenhua, Director of the Bureau, believes that Shanghai's situation is more special than other counties, and this facility is urgently needed. Therefore, he drafted a reason and submitted it to the Construction Department for review a few days ago. According to reports, Niu Yongjian is very concerned about this matter and yesterday sent a letter in his personal capacity to Sun, Director of the Construction Department, describing the degree of need and the hopes of the people in various districts, requesting that the Construction Bureau be ordered to build it as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>News of the Tram Strike in the Public Concession Yesterday</h3>
<p>Another Negotiation After Yesterday's Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 11:00 AM, workers from the new and old tram stations in the Public Concession successively gathered at a certain place in West Shanghai, with approximately 560 people. The chairman announced the start of the meeting, reported the progress, and solicited opinions. Afterwards, a worker from a certain number spoke, and the audience applauded and shouted slogans. At the end, a certain worker made a proposal. Three detectives sent by the company walked into the meeting place and said, "Please don't go to strike the trams or demonstrate. The company specially sent us to mediate. Please elect three representatives to go with us to meet the manager and discuss the conditions." The crowd did not agree at the time. After the detectives repeatedly stated that the company was sincerely negotiating, they immediately appointed one driver, one ticket seller, and one coppersmith to negotiate with Manager Bowkes, who agreed to add three yuan for rice subsidies and three yuan for wage increases. The remaining conditions were not agreed upon. The coppersmiths demanded that the wage increase issue be resolved by the foreman Parker. The representatives believed that they could not be satisfied, and insisted on conditions such as wages during the strike period, recognition of the club, and double pay for work on Sundays and holidays. They also insisted that the coppersmiths' problem must be resolved uniformly. The representatives reported the results of the negotiation to the crowd. In addition to continuing to insist on the above conditions, they also sent people to inquire about the foreman's supervisor and urged them to express their opinions as soon as possible so that the problems of the vehicle department and the machinery department could be resolved at the same time. However, the foreman was not at the old factory at the time. The crowd appointed representatives to handle this matter and then dispersed successively.</p>
<h3>County Construction Bureau Surveying Sanlintang Town</h3>
<p>Wu Wenhua, Director of the Shanghai County Construction Bureau, previously stated that the streets in various towns and villages in the county are narrow and the houses are uneven, which not only hinders traffic but also makes rescue extremely difficult in the event of a fire. Therefore, it is urgent to carry out rectification. He proposed to the Second County Administrative Meeting to organize a survey team to survey all towns and villages in the county as a basis for gradual improvement. It was resolved that the bureau should be responsible for contacting various districts and organizing them in order. However, this year, due to the importance of the North Huilu project, the bureau's technical personnel were insufficient, so it was delayed. Recently, the North Huilu infrastructure project has been completed and accepted by the department. The survey team and the Shanghai Municipal Port Authority and the Songjiang County Construction Bureau have also completed the survey of Chunshentang. Therefore, yesterday, the bureau specially appointed technician Wang Kerou to lead the survey team to Pudong to survey Sanlintang Town.</p>

<h3>Department of Industry and Commerce's Reply Regarding the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company's Factory Shutdown</h3>
<p>The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company previously submitted a petition to the Department of Industry and Commerce, expressing the unavoidable distress of temporarily suspending operations at its Shanghai factory and requesting its continued support. Now, we have received a reply from the Department of Industry and Commerce, document number 10008, which states: "We acknowledge the company's report that it has temporarily suspended its factory due to operational losses, and we are deeply concerned. We should provide assistance to enable it to return to its original state. The matters requested have already been referred to the Shanghai Special Municipality Government for investigation and handling." A copy of the communication to the Shanghai Special Municipality Government is transcribed below for your information and compliance. The matter for consultation is as follows: "According to the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company's petition, it is stating the unavoidable distress of suspending factory operations and requesting continued support, etc. Upon investigation, the temporary closure of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company has garnered considerable attention both domestically and internationally. This Ministry has received successive instructions from the Central Political Council and the Executive Yuan, as well as numerous appeals for assistance. It is imperative to devise a means of support to facilitate the resumption of operations. Upon detailed review of the company's submission, the fundamental causes of its losses can be summarized as follows: (1) rampant worker demands and excessive wages; (2) repeated increases in tobacco taxes and overly strict restrictions on marketing areas; and (3) difficulty in obtaining tax refunds for defective tobacco. Apart from labor-management issues, which should be handled promptly in accordance with the law, the tobacco tax matter has already been referred to the Ministry of Finance for handling, but no definitive solution has yet been reached. Currently, the company's submission only seeks a method of maintaining the current situation. After the shutdown, the Social Affairs Bureau has designated the severance pay received by workers as part of their wages, and it considers the company's failure to first apply for approval before suspending operations as illegal. In summary, the company's current requests for support are twofold: (1) that workers receive severance pay, which should be considered a final settlement, with no further complications; and (2) that it be temporarily permitted to subcontract cigarette rolling to other factories. Regarding the worker severance pay, it was handled based on the results of consultations between worker representatives elected by the laid-off employees and the company. The company has attached a contract and receipt photos as evidence. The contract signed by both parties naturally has legal effect, and no third party can deny it. The reason given for not reporting the factory shutdown in advance is that past experience has shown that prior reporting would inevitably lead to labor unrest, making it impossible to stop operations, and debts owed to people would be difficult to recover, requiring the arrangement to be made before the announcement so as not to be overwhelmed abruptly. This situation is common in the business world, and its unavoidable hardship is not without justification. As for subcontracting cigarette rolling to other factories, it is claimed that the per-unit labor cost is cheaper than manual rolling. The Ministry's opinion is that subcontracting the rolling to other factories means that the work is still being done by domestic workers, and one cannot say that the factory shutdown constitutes the destruction of labor. Since the labor cost is cheaper, it is a transitional method for resuming operations and maintaining business, which demonstrates good intentions. In conclusion, if the origins of the factory shutdown are as presented, then the requests are not excessive and should be supported to maintain this declining industry. Considering the aforementioned circumstances, we hereby enclose a copy of the submission, along with a copy of the contract, receipt photos, etc., and request that your Special Municipality Government investigate and handle the matter, provide support, and provide a response." This communication is addressed to the Shanghai Special Municipality Government, with one copy of the submission, a copy of the contract, and photos of receipts attached. [Signed] Minister Kong Xiangxi</p>
<h3>Bank of China's 1929 Report</h3>
<p>The Bank of China has been established for eight years since its inception. Since the promulgation of the new regulations in October 1928, it has immediately changed its business strategy to focus on domestic and international remittances, in order to support the development of domestic and international trade and live up to the expectations of the nation and society. Over the past year, it has taken shape, but at this time of transition between old and new policies, let us review the past years, during which losses and gains, innovations and reforms, and difficulties overcome are worth mentioning. They are summarized as follows to help learn from the past and know the future.</p>
<p>(1) Establishment of the Bank of China and Repayment of Commercial Shares and Deposits of the Ta Ching Government Bank The Bank of China was transformed from the Ta Ching Government Bank. After the successful Xinhai Revolution, the Commercial Shareholders Association of the Ta Ching Government Bank petitioned the Nanjing Provisional Government to rename the former Shanghai Ta Ching Government Bank as the Bank of China and establish branches in Nanjing. In April, after the unification of the North and South, the Central Government ordered the establishment of a preparatory office for the Bank of China in Beijing to plan for a well-organized national bank. In April of the second year, the Senate announced that the Bank of China would only receive a government allocation of 2,930,587 yuan in silver as a start-up fund. The Bank of China has been able to gradually grow and develop from such a small capital to what it is today, and its ability to win social credit and establish the foundation of the bank cannot be achieved without mentioning one thing, which is the assumption of commercial shares and deposits of the Ta Ching Government Bank. According to the investigation, the Ta Ching Government Bank has a total of 5 million taels of commercial shares, which the Bank of China exchanged for deposit certificates to be repaid in four years with interest at 5%. In addition, the Ta Ching Government Bank has more than 6.7 million taels of deposits, which the Bank of China also repaid in installments over the years. Those under 2,000 taels were repaid in one year, and those over 2,000 taels were repaid in three years. This amount of advance payment was then gradually allocated by the government. At that time, although the Bank of China clearly knew that its own capabilities were weak, it dared to resolutely take on the responsibility of repaying on behalf of the government. On the one hand, it relied on the government's prestige, and on the other hand, it recognized that maintaining credit was the foundation for the survival of the bank. Therefore, it did not hesitate to bear this heavy responsibility, and the bank was able to instill the basic thinking of running a bank into the minds of its employees from the very beginning, so that employees were always vigilant in maintaining credit. Its contribution to the development of the Bank of China is not insignificant.</p>
<p>(2) The Bank of China Performs the Duties of a National Bank In April of the second year of the Republic, the Ministry of Finance established the National Tax Office Preparatory Office to unify national taxes and promulgated the Treasury Regulations, entrusting the Bank of China to manage the General Treasury and national branch treasuries, hoping to gradually achieve the effect of treasury unification. Therefore, the Bank of China actively prepared to take over the treasuries of various provinces, either by establishing branches or entrusting official silver houses to act as agents. On the one hand, it sent personnel to Japan to investigate the Japanese bank's management of the national treasury. By the end of the fourth year, the treasuries of fifteen provinces, including Zhili, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Shanxi, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Fengtian, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Guisui, had been taken over by the Bank of China. The total amount received by the bank throughout the year was about 123 million yuan, which is not much different from the current national treasury revenue of the National Government excluding customs duties. This is the most noteworthy period in the history of national finance. However, although the Bank of China has worked hard to take over the treasury under the government's orders, the official authorities in various provinces have made it a condition that the Bank of China must provide advance payments when the going gets tough. To this day, the official authorities of various provincial branches owe advance payments of six or seven million yuan, all of which occurred because of this. Secondly, assisting the central government in reorganizing the currency system was also an important task undertaken by the Bank of China at that time. At that time, official silver money houses in various provinces were issuing paper money indiscriminately, and the currency system was chaotic, which was very harmful. In particular, the paper money in Guangdong, Jiangxi, and the three northeastern provinces depreciated the most. The paper money issued in Guangdong was about 30 million yuan, and the price was set at 50%. The government allocated money to recover it, and the Bank of China made up for the insufficient amount, totaling 1,380,200 yuan. The money tickets issued in Jiangxi were 8 million strings, and the Bank of China borrowed 2 million yuan to recover them at a fixed price. Later, because this amount was not enough, it issued 4 million yuan of currency public bonds and ordered the Bank of China to underwrite them, totaling 3.6 million yuan. The official notes issued in Jilin were originally to be prepared jointly by the central and local governments and handed over to the Bank of China to recover them with the Bank of China exchange coupons. Later, it was stopped halfway, totaling 1,675,300 yuan. The total amount of advance payments made by the Bank of China for the above three items was about 6,655,500 yuan. At the same time, in terms of current coins, the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China assisted the government in recovering the Mexican silver dollars and other silver dollars of various colors and recasting them into national currency. The bank and the money industry association agreed that from August 1 of the fourth year of the Republic, the market price of all dragon silver dollars would be abolished, and only the market price of new coins would be opened every day. However, the four types of silver dollars in Jiangnan, Hubei, Guangdong, and the Ta Ching silver coins were all used in accordance with the market price of new coins. Other silver coins could be exchanged for new coins at the bank. The quota was 20,000 yuan per day. Although there are no precise figures recorded at that time, the total amount of gradual recovery and exchange over the years should be more than 20 or 30 million, which made the elimination of miscellaneous coins gradually reduce year by year. The foundation of today's national currency is based on this. If this kind of reorganization policy could have continued during these ten years, then China's currency system would have been completely changed, and the huge amount of money sacrificed by the Bank of China due to its responsibilities would not have been wasted. This is indeed something that the bank regrets, and it is also the most painful thing in the history of China's currency system.</p>
<p>(3) The Suspension of Convertibility Order in the Fifth Year of the Republic and the Major Reforms of the Bank of China When the national finance, finance, and the Bank of China's business credit were thriving, there was a sudden political change in the Hongxian monarchy, and the North and South armies rose up, resulting in the suspension of convertibility order in May of the fifth year. The shareholders must still remember that the Shanghai Bank of China was the first to oppose the order and continued to convert as usual. This move laid the foundation for today's promotion and issuance. However, the northern banks of China were forced to suspend convertibility because they were close to the government's sphere of influence. As a result, the government believed that since the paper money was not convertible, it could be borrowed at will. Under this threat, although it tried to refuse, by the 10th of the fifth year, the amount of issuance had reached more than 60 million. Later, the reorganization of these 60 million non-convertible paper money was half funded by the government issuing public bonds and half by the bank raising funds on its own. During this period, it took ten years of hard work until the end of the 16th year of the Republic to finally settle the case. For the country and the bank, the losses were obvious, and this is a fact that cannot be forgotten when talking about China's currency system in the future. However, the Bank of China has gained three major realizations as a result. First, an issuing bank must seek independence in its business. Therefore, in November of the sixth year, it was approved by the government to amend the regulations, and the president and vice president, who were originally appointed by the government, were changed to be appointed from the directors elected by the shareholders' meeting. At the same time, it was determined that the capital would be raised to 10 million yuan, half official and half commercial, so that the shareholders' meeting would be the highest authority of the bank. In the past ten years, political changes have been frequent, and the Bank of China has been able to maintain its independent spirit and not be affected by political tides, which is due to the regulations of the sixth year of the Republic and has laid its foundation. Second, the local branches should maintain their considerable independence. Because of the lesson of the suspension of convertibility in the fifth year of the Republic, it was realized that if the political situation was not unified in China, which has a large territory, if the bank's business was to be completely unified and centralized, it would not only affect the whole body due to the changes in one place, but also make the local people suspect that the funds in one place were being supplied to another place, which would shake the people's faith. Therefore, it is better to maintain the considerable independence of the local branches, each taking the interests of the local society as the premise, and first completely distinguish the styles and colors of the paper money issued by the branches, and the conversion reserve fund is also independent. For example, the Tianjin branch hired British accountant Si Peimen on November 30 of the tenth year of the Republic to check the accounts and count the inventory, and invited official authorities, chambers of commerce, and banking money industry associations to the bank to publicly inspect the reserves. For another example, the Shanghai branch publicly prepared on May 4 of the thirteenth year of the Republic because the various banks and villages used this coupon, and invited the various banks and villages to the bank to inspect and verify it. As for the issuance of exchange coupons by the Shanghai branch itself, the Ministry approved the establishment of an issuance preparation inspection committee on March 29 of the seventeenth year to conduct public inspections once a month. All of this is to gain the trust of the local people and to strive to fulfill the responsibilities of serving the society. Therefore, after the tenth year of the Republic, the various branches were not affected by the successive Wan-Zhi War, Feng-Zhi War, North-South War, and the suspension of Han coupons by the Wuhan government in the sixteenth year of the Republic, which was not due to this. Third, the business policy must focus on commercial aspects. After the fifth year of the Republic, the national unity was destroyed, and the unification of finance and currency was hopeless. Therefore, the business policy of the Bank of China could not be changed from the government side to the commercial side as soon as possible. The issuance of paper money was not mainly based on treasury expenditures, but on purchasing or discounting commercial term bills. The recruitment of customers did not focus on the deposits and loans of official authorities, but on the transactions of merchants and people. As a result of the above-mentioned realizations, we are seeking to gradually implement the reform. Since the fifth year of the Republic, the number of issuing banks has gradually increased, and the various banks have worked hard to collect deposits. However, according to the latest report (end of the seventeenth year), the total amount issued by the various issuing banks in the country is about 295 million yuan (excluding non-convertible paper money), and the total amount issued by the Bank of China accounts for 58% of the total. The number of deposits also accounts for 39% of the total of 983.2 million yuan in all banks. After suffering great pain, we are fortunate to have achieved such results, which is something that the bank is proud of.</p>
<p>(4) Comparison of the Bank of China's Business in the Sixth and Seventeenth Years of the Republic The amendment of the regulations at the end of the sixth year of the Republic and the establishment of the shareholder meeting can be said to be a major change in the Bank of China. In October of the seventeenth year of the Republic, the regulations were re-promulgated and changed to an international remittance bank, which can be said to be another major change. Therefore, comparing the number of assets and liabilities in the sixth year with the number of assets and liabilities in the seventeenth year can also give us a glimpse of the bank's progress. According to the investigation, the paid-in capital in the sixth year of the Republic was 12,279,800 yuan, and the paid-in capital in the seventeenth year of the Republic was 24,710,200 yuan. The total amount of fixed and current deposits in the sixth year of the Republic was 148,714,965 yuan, and the total amount of fixed and current deposits in the seventeenth year of the Republic was 387,680,780 yuan. The amount of exchange coupons issued in the sixth year of the Republic was 72,984,307 yuan, and the amount of exchange coupons issued in the seventeenth year of the Republic was 172,304,020 yuan. The value of business real estate, etc., in the sixth year was 2,410,892 yuan, and in the seventeenth year it was 4,964,567 yuan. The value of securities in the sixth year was 4,093,433 yuan, and in the seventeenth year it was 32,600,359 yuan. According to this, we can know that the bank's business is gradually developing, and the progress of the circulation of market securities can also be inferred. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Ministry Order Prohibiting Yellow Phosphorus Matches</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Public Security Bureau yesterday received an instruction from the Municipal Government, which stated that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had approved the Central Executive Committee Secretariat's Letter No. 5666, which stated that the Standing Committee had submitted a case from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Special Party Headquarters, which forwarded a request from the Second District Party Headquarters to prohibit the sale of red-headed matches to avoid danger. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce was instructed to review and reply, and a copy of the original submission was enclosed for your reference and reply. After reviewing the copy of the submission, the name of the red-headed matches mentioned in the submission is different from the yellow phosphorus matches prohibited from manufacture and sale in the previous notification of the Ministry, and the coloring of the match heads varies depending on the pigments used. Red matches are not necessarily yellow phosphorus matches, and yellow phosphorus matches are not necessarily red matches. If only red-headed matches are prohibited, it seems inappropriate, but although the manufacture and sale of yellow phosphorus matches have been strictly prohibited, it is feared that businessmen may neglect them and still sell them. Although the red-headed matches mentioned by the District Party Headquarters cannot be regarded as yellow phosphorus matches, they cannot be determined to be non-yellow phosphorus matches. In order to implement the ban on the manufacture and sale of yellow phosphorus matches, we request that your government reiterate the previous order and order your subordinates to strictly prohibit them. If the red-headed matches are yellow phosphorus matches, they should be prohibited in accordance with the original case. In addition to notifying and replying, we hereby enclose a copy of the original submission for your inspection and handling, and we hope to receive a reply. In addition to replying and notifying, we hereby order the Bureau to comply with this order as a whole.</p>

<h3>Three Assassins on Moganshan Road</h3>
<p>The Residence of the Fujian Finance Director is Secluded; Three People Secretly Wait with Plans to Succeed; The Bodyguard is Alert; Both Sides Open Fire; The Assassins Escape; Dangerous Weapons are Left Behind</p>
<p>At 8:15 last night, at the residence of Li Shuxun, number 63 Moganshan Road in the French Concession of Shanghai, three assassins suddenly appeared and lingered at the entrance of Li's residence. Fortunately, Li's bodyguard, Yang, was alert and stepped forward to question them. The assassins actually opened fire and shot. Yang also drew his gun and returned fire. Neither side was injured. The assassins took the opportunity to escape. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Residence is Secluded Li Shuxun, courtesy name Fuhou, is from Zhejiang and is 47 years old. He is good at financial management and proficient in writing. He is a close friend of Yang Shuzhuang, chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government. In September of last year, he took office as the Director of Finance of Fujian Province and also served as a standing committee member of the Shanghai Jiaotong Bank. His family resided in Shanghai, previously living at No. 5 Baoren Lane, Roufei Road. Because the air there was poor, they moved to the house at No. 63 Moganshan Road a month ago. The house is a fine Western-style building, but the location is extremely secluded, and the house is located at the end of an alley, making it easy for bandits to hide.</p>
<p>Strict Security Measures Li took over the post of Minister of Finance of Fujian Province. In view of the poor environment, he took three months' leave and came to Shanghai in early January of the lunar calendar. As soon as he unloaded his luggage, he telegraphed Chairman Yang to resign. However, Yang always tried to persuade him to stay, only allowing him to extend his leave and strongly advising him not to think of resigning. However, Li's resignation was very firm. At the end of last month, he continued to submit a second resignation. It has not yet been decided whether or not to approve it. Li lives a secluded life in Shanghai, and those who visit him morning and evening are still constantly coming. Li took strict precautions and hired a bodyguard to follow him in and out for protection. A Black-Clad Young Man Li's bodyguard, Yang Jinhui, is from Guangdong. He is short, stout, very alert, and has been with Li for many years. He is very loyal. At about 8:00 PM last night, Yang had finished dinner and was walking out of the residence from the east side path with Li's chauffeur, Ni. Suddenly, he saw a young man in black shorts hiding in the evergreen bushes under the stairs on the west side of Li's residence's gate. Seeing Yang come out, he looked flustered. The chauffeur, Ni, stepped forward to question him. The young man spoke in a Hunan accent and answered vaguely.</p>
<p>Two People Jumped Out While the chauffeur was questioning the young man, two people suddenly jumped out from near the garage on the west side of the house, one in a long gown and one in shorts, both in black. They pointed their guns at Yang and fired a shot, which missed. Yang also drew his self-defense pistol and fired two shots. Because it was dark, he did not hit them. All three bandits took the opportunity to escape. At the same time, a Westerner, an engineer from the French Public Works Bureau living across from Li, heard the alarm and immediately reported it to the police by telephone. The police chief immediately ordered detectives to rush to the scene and search in all directions, but the bandits had already disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>A Paper Package A reporter from this newspaper immediately hired a car to visit after hearing the news. After submitting his card, Li personally came out to meet him and told him the details. According to Li, the two people who came were probably not kidnappers. In his estimation (Li referring to himself), most of them were from the reactionary faction in Fujian. Their purpose was to assassinate him personally. When the three bandits left, they left behind a paper package containing a hemp rope, a sharp axe, and wrapped in the "Jiangnan Evening News." According to the police detectives, the sharp axe was brought to pry the door open. When he said this, his attitude was calm and smiling, as if nothing had happened. After the conversation, the clock struck eleven. The reporter then took his leave.</p>

<p>Both Sides Have a Gangster Background; Little Si Zi Tries His Best to Help His Lover</p>
<p>Tai Xing women Shao Aibao, 18 years old, and Shao Xiubao, 16 years old, sisters, because of famine in their hometown, asked a fellow villager, Zhu Yueqing, to bring them to Shanghai to work two years ago in the autumn. Zhu is now a female worker in a yarn factory in Xiaoshadu, Shanghai. She has contracted to provide meals for a period of three years. During the period, the wages earned by the two women are all owned by Zhu, who provides the two women with food and lodging. A contract was signed. After Zhu brought the two women to Shanghai, she sent them to a certain Japanese yarn factory. At first, they worked as female workers in the coarse yarn section, and then they were transferred to the fine yarn section. Each person could earn 24 or 25 yuan a month. The wages received by the two women each month were taken away by Zhu, and they were not given a penny for pocket money. Ai Bao and others felt unwilling and wanted to quit the factory, but they were bound by the contract. Ai Bao had reached the age of marriage, and her feelings had been aroused. The sisters were both quite beautiful. A man from Yangzhou, Cai Xiao Si Zi, who is now in his twenties, also contracts the meals for female workers in the workshop. Cai is a disciple of a well-known local gangster, A. He gradually fell in love with Ai Bao. Ai Bao discussed with Xiao Si Zi. Before that day, after collecting the wages for the previous month in the yarn factory, they moved to Xiao Si Zi's home with her sister, Xiu Bao. Zhu learned about it and questioned Xiao Si Zi, but Xiao Si Zi relied on the local gangsters for protection and ignored him. The previous day, Zhu also invited a gangster and his cronies to a tea house on Robert Road to have a tea drinking (negotiation) with Xiao Si Zi. The two sides each led their followers, and the momentum was fierce, almost to the point of using force. Later, a detective came out to mediate. Because the fault was with Xiao Si Zi, Xiao Si Zi compensated Zhu Yueqing for 50 yuan in losses, and the meal contract for Ai Bao and Xiu Bao was canceled, allowing them to be free. Xiao Si Zi also set up four tables (that is, four tables of wine for a banquet for the gangsters to apologize), inviting the younger brothers from both sides to a banquet to settle the matter.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit over Lawyer's Fees in the New Da Ming Case</h3>
<p>Roger Wants to Obtain Compensation for Cargo Loss as Legal Fees; The Claim is Inappropriate and is Rejected; The Case May Still Be Appealed</p>
<p>The Hou Tian Maru steamship of the Sato Trading Company of Japan sank the New Da Ming steamship of the Datong Company in the foreign waters of Chongming Outer Sands in the spring of the year before last. In addition to the loss of ships and cargo, hundreds of Chinese passengers were drowned. The issue of compensation for personal injury has been negotiated to this day without any progress. The damage to the ships and cargo has been resolved by arbitration. The person who handled the case for Datong at that time was originally an American lawyer named Roger. During the process, he suddenly coerced Datong manager Yang Zaitian to increase the extra amount of office expenses. Yang refused. After receiving compensation from the Japanese side, Roger filed a lawsuit against Yang, demanding 45,000 taels in office expenses. The former Provisional Court had already concluded the hearing and ordered a sentence to be awaited. Yang Zaitian then hired lawyers Zhan Jifeng and Gao Shuo to request a new debate, and another hearing was held. It was only yesterday that the Chief of the Civil Division of the Special District Local Court, Ying Shi, announced the verdict in the case. The plaintiff, Roger, expressed dissatisfaction in court because the amount awarded by the court was very different from what he requested. He also claimed that the defendant's compensation for the loss of cargo should be given to him as legal fees, otherwise, he would still have to appeal. Court President Ying rejected his claim as illegal. As for not accepting the verdict, he was allowed to appeal. The case still has some ramifications.</p>
<h3>Declaration of Closure by Meat Merchants in Yanpu, Pudong</h3>
<p>Oppose Slaughtering at Tangqiao and Yangjing; Long-Distance Steaming and Sun Exposure Obstructs Hygiene</p>
<p>Meat shops in Yanpu and the surrounding areas of Pudong have collectively closed down because the Hygiene Bureau's pig slaughtering facilities are set up too far away, making it very inconvenient to slaughter pigs and travel back and forth. The details were published in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the meat merchants issued a declaration yesterday to appeal to all sectors of society. The wording is roughly as follows: The reason for this strike is that the Hygiene Bureau must set up public slaughterhouses in appropriate locations in the towns of Pudong, Lannidu, Yangjiadu, and Laobaidu. At that time, our meat industry recognized it in unison, and there were veterinarians and technicians dispatched by the Hygiene Bureau and fees for stamping and inspection. Unexpectedly, the Hygiene Bureau suddenly canceled the public slaughterhouse problem in these three places and ordered everyone to slaughter at the public slaughterhouses set up in Tangqiao or Yangjing. Considering that when the heat of summer is approaching, the temperature of the freshly slaughtered white meat has not yet subsided, how can it withstand this long journey? Dust flies and the hot sun shines. Moreover, the road conditions are inconvenient, and the traffic is difficult. By the time the vehicles arrive at the shops for distribution, it is not early, and it must have rotted and is not even suitable for the market. Although the Hygiene Bureau has the hard work of maintaining hygiene, it actually hinders hygiene. Although our meat industry has repeatedly requested the Hygiene Bureau to set up public slaughterhouses in three places to benefit the people and maintain business operations, and has been running around for nearly a year, the Hygiene Bureau still does not understand and still orders us to slaughter at Tangqiao and Yangjing. Our meat industry has no other way but to sacrifice our business and temporarily suspend operations for a few days to seek the Hygiene Bureau's understanding and allow us to achieve our minimum requirement of establishing public slaughterhouses in three places.</p>
<h3>Pitiful Weak Woman</h3>
<p>A Tailor Not Only Defiled Her Body But Also Planned to Sell Her to Harbin; After the Case Was Cracked, Jin Mei Was Confused and Had Not Eaten for a Day and a Night</p>
<p>Nanjing woman Chen Jinmei, 20 years old, lost her father in infancy and was raised by her mother. When she was three years old, she moved her family from her hometown to Shanghai and relied on her mother for a living. Later, when she grew up, she was introduced to work in the Dacheng Yarn Factory in Yangshupu to supplement her family's livelihood. Unexpectedly, Liu Jialu (also known as Zifeng), a man from Anhui, 30 years old, already married, lived at No. 22 Minhou Lane, Hartong Road, and made a living by opening a tailor shop at home. He often went to Yangshupu to play with friends. Two years ago, he got to know Jinmei. The friendship developed further, and a love relationship grew stronger. Liu did not explicitly state that he was married. Therefore, he and Jinmei rented a small house in Caojiadu to live together like a married couple. However, Liu's daily income was limited. Once he was burdened with living expenses in two places, he could not afford it. Therefore, in October of last year, he moved Jinmei back to his home in Minhou Lane to save expenses. Jinmei saw that Liu had a wife and that she had fallen to the status of a mistress. Resentment was difficult to calm. Then she saw that things had come to this point, and arguing was also ineffective. Therefore, she bowed her head without a word. However, Liu's family became poorer day by day, which led to an evil idea. He secretly colluded with several friends with the surname Peng and planned to find a way to sell Jinmei to a brothel in Harbin to make a profit. After the plan was completed, he falsely claimed to Jinmei that he would introduce her to a family with the surname of a resident in Harbin to work as a helper, earning 24 yuan a month. Jinmei heard that following Liu in Shanghai had no prospect of advancement, so she might as well go to Harbin for the time being and plan for the future. She immediately expressed satisfaction. Therefore, at 5 PM on the previous day, Liu and his accomplices lured Jinmei to the Jiangma Wharf in Lujiazui, Pudong, to board the Hexing steamship of the Zhaoxing Company in order to go to Yingkou and then to Harbin. At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the ship was about to set sail when the investigator Lin Yongfang and Chen Shaoting of the Relief Association boarded the ship and questioned Liu and others, revealing loopholes in their words. Peng and several other accomplices of Liu saw that the situation was not good and rushed ashore to escape. Only Liu did not escape in time and was arrested. Jinmei was taken to the water police station together. Liu began to describe the details of the fraudulent plan without reservation. The police chief then took Jinmei to the case for preliminary interrogation. Unexpectedly, she still did not know that she had been deceived and claimed that all her clothes had been pawned and that she had no prospect of success in Shanghai. She was willing to go to Harbin to work as a helper and had not eaten for a day and a night. She also had no money on her. The police chief saw that she was still stubbornly unaware of the danger and told her about Liu's evil plan to sell her into prostitution. Jinmei was shocked to hear this. The Chinese detectives and others felt very pitiful for her and gave her food. In the afternoon, Liu and Jinmei were escorted to the local court for disposal.</p>

<p>The Shandong sand boat Yang Dahe Hao was carrying yarn and cloth from Xiehexiang Hao to Yantai this time. On the 8th of this month, it had already arrived in the waters of Yantai. Suddenly, a thick fog made it impossible to identify the direction. Just as it was about to head towards the coast, it accidentally went the wrong way and hit a rocky beach. The hull of the ship was smashed into two pieces. More than a dozen of the more than 30 crew members were lost. A lot of the cargo was washed away by the waves. Those on board were also stained with water. The Shenji Freight Forwarder in Yantai hired a machine to salvage the sunken cargo and the bodies of the crew members. Yesterday, a telegram was sent to the Shanghai Gongji Freight Forwarder to inform Xiehexiang Hao and others to check and seize the cargo, which was worth 56,000 or 7,000 gold. The ship itself also cost tens of thousands of gold. It was also heard that the families of the crew members were worried and came to the company yesterday to inquire about the situation.</p>

<p>Zhu Jingan, a native of Anhui living at No. 1981 Awenyi Road, hired three strong Russians as guards because his son and nephew had been kidnapped once last year and rescued by the police. On the night of the 9th, one of them, named Maikaifu, especially went to the West Prison on Xiamen Road to visit a friend. When he passed Guangxi Road, he suddenly clashed with Li Weijia, a nurse from the Suzhou Epidemic Hospital on Tibet Road. Maikaifu immediately took out a pistol from his side and struck Li's head and face with the handle. Bystanders protested and called two Chinese police officers to take the Russian and the gun to the police station. It was found that the gun had been registered by his employer. The next morning, he was escorted to the Special District Local Court. Court President Xu interrogated him. Li Weijia came to court and stated that he was walking home with a friend from the Samsung Stage via Guangxi Road when he was suddenly beaten in the face from behind with a gun stock. The injuries required two weeks to heal and had cost 78 yuan in medical expenses. The defendant also admitted that he had struck the person with a gun. Court President Xu sentenced Maikaifu to 20 days of detention for assault and ordered him to pay Li Weijia 78 yuan in medical expenses. He was fined 20 yuan for the violation.

<h3>Samsung Factory Laid Off Workers; A Friend Beat the Manager and Was Injured</h3>
<p>Also Sent a Letter of Threat</p>
<p>Wang Kehua, who used to work at the Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory, was laid off for some reason and repeatedly harassed the factory. He was not paid any attention. Wang became even more unscrupulous and sent a threatening letter to Zhang Zian, the manager of the factory's distribution office in Yuxing Lane, Nanyi Road, in an attempt to defraud a large sum of money. Failing to achieve his goal, he committed violence at the entrance of Yuxing Lane when Zhang went out the day before yesterday morning. Although he tried to avoid it, he was still injured. The police officer heard the alarm and arrested Wang. The next morning, he was escorted to the Special District Local Court. The plaintiff, Zhang Zian, hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to represent him and stated the incident in the past. He requested a new date because he still needed to additionally accuse the defendant of sending a threatening letter. Judge Shen ordered the defendant to be detained pending a new hearing. Zhang is still being treated in the hospital.</p>
<h3>A Car Violates Regulations and Speeds, Causing Disaster</h3>
<p>Claims 600 Taels in Damages</p>
<p>Shen Abao hired a lawyer to represent him in the criminal court, claiming that the plaintiff was driving car number 6620 on Julai Road from east to west at 12:30 on March 27. At that time, the defendant Xu Changsheng's car number 1707 rushed out of Gubalu Road from south to north. The driver drove fast, causing the rear wheel of the plaintiff's car to be violently hit, and the car overturned on the side of the road. The police officers sent by the police station found that the plaintiff's car was driving on the main road, and the defendant's car was driving on the branch road. It was found that cars driving on the branch road should drive slowly and pay attention to whether there are vehicles coming and going on the main road before they can drive across the main road. Now the defendant did not pay attention and drove straight ahead at full speed, causing this disaster. He requested to recover the repair fees, etc., totaling more than 600 taels, etc. Judge Zhu Cheng instructed that the police station should thoroughly investigate the situation at the time of the disaster before conducting a new hearing.</p>
<h3>Dismantling a Truck to Commit Violence Leads to Litigation</h3>
<p>Jia Zhican and Jia Shuming, father and son, represented by lawyers Jin Fan and Li Yuan, stated in the Criminal Court of the French Concession Court that the plaintiffs owned two trucks used for transporting goods for customers. They regularly purchased gasoline from Zhenli Gasoline Company, operated by Tang Hangjian at No. 705 Beile Road (Route Ghisi) on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. On the 7th of last month, when they went to the company to purchase gasoline, Tang led a group of people to dismantle the engine parts, tires, and other components of the plaintiffs' trucks. When the plaintiff Jia Shuming protested, Tang assaulted him and, with the help of several workers, beat Jia Shuming, causing injuries that required treatment at Zhongnan Hospital. They have a medical certificate as proof. The plaintiffs, father and son, rely on these trucks for their livelihood, earning forty yuan per day.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>May 12th, 1930 (Fourth Sheet of Shen Bao)</p>
<p>The defendant's act of dismantling the truck parts prevented them from operating for a month, constituting the crime of injury under Article 293 and the crime of damage under Article 382 of the Criminal Law. They requested prosecution and compensation for all losses. The defendant, Tang Hangjian, represented by lawyer Plumer, argued that the plaintiffs owed him 394 yuan for gasoline, for which they had issued a check that bounced upon presentation. On the day in question, the plaintiffs' truck came to refuel, so he removed the spark plug to prevent it from moving, but did not dismantle the entire truck or incite a mob to commit violence as alleged. He requested that the case be dismissed. The court instructed further investigation. The day before, the plaintiffs' lawyer stated that the police investigation confirmed that the defendant had dismantled the truck and impounded it, refusing to return it. They requested that the court rule accordingly. The defendant's lawyer, Plumer, defended him. Judge Zhu Cheng announced the end of the arguments and adjourned for deliberation and judgment.</p>
<h3>Robbery of Three Thousand Yuan Solved on the Same Day</h3>
<p>Mr. Yang, a relief worker at the Shanghai Amusement Park, along with another relief worker and a shop assistant, hired a company car at 12:40 AM yesterday, carrying two small silver boxes containing 3,000 yuan in relief funds. As the car arrived at the entrance of Ma Dun Lane (where Yang resided) on Avenue Edward VII and they were opening the door, four robbers emerged from the darkness, brandishing fake pistols and demanding silence.

<h3>Unable to Make a Living, Forced to Live with Another Man</h3>
<p>The Plight of Ma Tao, Who Has Not Divorced Her Husband, Comes to Shanghai to File a Complaint</p>
<p>Ma Tao, a woman from Yancheng, is 30 years old. Her husband, Ma Jinsheng, is 34 years old. The couple used to farm in their hometown. They have two daughters, one eight years old and one four years old. Two years ago, Jinsheng suddenly fell ill and became paralyzed, unable to work. Coupled with a year of famine, the family of four struggled to survive. The woman had no choice but to bring her two daughters to Shanghai in March of last year, where they were unfamiliar with the place and had to beg for a living. They were often hungry and sheltered wherever they could find a place to rest. In September, they encountered a fellow villager, Ms. Qi, in Zhabei, who took pity on their plight and introduced the woman to her brother, Qi Zhaobin. They began living together, allowing the woman and her two daughters to have a place to live. Qi rented a house in Caojiadu, West Shanghai, where they lived together as if they were a married couple. The woman sent a letter to her hometown, and soon after, her uncle sent a letter back, falsely claiming that her husband, Jinsheng, had passed away due to illness. Believing that her husband was dead, the woman decided to spend the rest of her life with Qi. However, the woman's uncle had secretly learned about her relationship with Qi in Shanghai and deliberately sent the letter falsely claiming her husband's death. He also informed Jinsheng. Jinsheng was furious and came to Shanghai with his uncle, Ma Delin, a few days ago. Yesterday, they found Qi Zhaobin and his wife, Ma Tao, and took them to the Sixth District Police Station, accusing Qi Zhaobin of abducting and forcing her to live with him. The district chief questioned them separately. Ma Tao confessed that she voluntarily lived with Qi because she could not make a living by begging. Qi Zhaobin, 32 years old, from Yancheng, who worked as a rickshaw puller, stated that the woman voluntarily lived with him and that he did not force her. The district chief, considering the case to involve marital disputes, prepared a report and transferred it to the court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Accusation of a Daughter-in-Law's Adultery</h3>
<p>The Son's Survival is a Question</p>
<p>Pan Qiuquan, a villager from Guidun, Chuansha, yesterday brought his daughter-in-law, Pan Zhu, and her lover, Tang Liusheng, to the Third District, Third Branch Police Station, accusing them of adultery and desertion. The station chief conducted a preliminary investigation. Pan Qiuquan stated that he had a son named Miaogen, 21 years old, who was a tailor. When his son was 17, he married Pan Zhu as his daughter-in-law. However, only a month after the marriage, their relationship soured, and his son left home in anger four years ago. He heard that his son was working in Hankou, but his daughter-in-law did not stay home and ran away in April of the previous year. He found her in Yaojiaqiao, Beicai, Pudong, where he discovered that she was having an affair with Tang Liusheng. He requested an investigation. Pan Zhu, 20 years old, whose father's name is Zhu Zhangjin and lived in Longwang Temple, Pudong, stated that she was forcibly married to Pan Qiuquan at the age of 16 in September. At the time, her father was ill and died of shock. After she was taken away, his son was still wandering outside. He returned on the fifth day of the tenth month and they got married. On the eighth day of the eleventh month, his son went to Shanghai and never returned. The following July, a letter was sent by the godfather of Miaogen in Shanghai, stating that Miaogen had died on July 13th. Therefore, her family set up a mourning altar. On the 28th day of the eleventh month, she went out to work as a servant. Pan Qiuquan intended to find her a replacement husband from Chongming, but this person had parents and had to send ten yuan home every month, and Pan Qiuquan also wanted this person to pay him ten yuan per month, which was beyond the person's means, so it did not work out. In April of the following year, she had to go out to work as a servant again and voluntarily chose Tang Liusheng. She was a widow and could be free. Tang Liusheng stated that the woman voluntarily followed him, and he said that he had no property, and she said that even if they begged for food, she would be willing. They would each take a stick and that she had no husband. This time, Pan Qiuquan wanted to collect a bride price but failed and falsely accused them. The police station considered the case to involve criminal matters and transferred it to the District Court for investigation.</p>

The night before, she was scolded by her mother for some unknown reason. She was angry and bought opium from a nearby Yanzichao and swallowed it to commit suicide. After returning home, she covered herself with a blanket and went to sleep. Soon after, she became delirious and groaned incessantly. Her neighbors noticed something was wrong and entered the room. She told her neighbors to quickly call her mother, otherwise she might not be able to see her again. The neighbors immediately called her mother and urged her husband to return home.

<p>The Fourth District Public Security Bureau of Zhabei received a secret report at around 5 PM the day before yesterday that a trafficker was hiding a young girl at No. 129 Haichang Road, intending to sell her. The district chief ordered the police to rescue her. They rescued a 15-year-old girl, Qian Hongying, and arrested You Zhao, a woman from Changzhou. According to Qian Hongying, she was from Zhujiaqiao, Pudong, and was the adopted daughter-in-law of Qian Zilin, a fellow villager. In January of this year, her father-in-law asked her to find an apron, but she could not find it and left home crying by the bridge. She met an old man from Changzhou who asked her what was wrong and suggested that she go to Shanghai to work as a servant. She followed him to Shanghai and was sent to You Zhao's house on Haichang Road on the seventh day of the fourth lunar month, where she was not allowed to go out. You Zhao, 44 years old, from Changzhou, stated that on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month, she met an unknown person at Jing'an Temple who temporarily placed Qian Hongying with her, and she did not know the details. The district chief considered that You Zhao's collusion in trafficking Qian Hongying was a violation of the law and ordered her to be handed over to the Judicial Section for investigation.</p>

<p>Wang Zhang, a laundrywoman who lived at No. 34 Yinghua Street, was nearly 50 years old and had only one daughter named Jin Yuan, who was 16 years old and still unmarried. The night before, she returned home from outside, looking worried. When asked, she remained silent and then sobbed softly, her face pale. Her mother was shocked and found an empty opium box beside her, realizing that she had taken poison. She was sent to Renji Hospital, but the poison had already entered her organs and could not be saved by medicine. She died shortly after. The hospital reported the incident to the Laozha Police Station, which sent detectives to the scene and then had the body taken to the Feilun Road morgue for examination. When Wang Zhang was questioned about the reason for the poisoning, she was also unaware, so the reason for the suicide remained unknown. The report was submitted to the Special District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Guo to examine the body and determined that she had died from smoking opium. He instructed Wang Zhang to sign a statement and claim the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Accusation of Gambling and Misappropriating Large Sums of Money</h3>
<p>Wang Wenzhang, a Secretary at Mobil Oil Company, Embezzles Relief Funds Amounting to Seven Thousand Taels</p>
<p>Wang Wenzhang, a Ningbo native who worked as a Secretary for Mobil Oil Company, had a salary of more than seventy yuan per month. However, Wang had a strong addiction to gambling in recent years. Whenever he was free from work, he would go to various gambling dens to compete. This created a financial crisis, and he had no choice but to find another way to misappropriate funds to generate income. He would take out the cash relief funds he had collected and replace them with bad checks. This kind of trick was only discovered by Li Dao, a Westerner in the company, a few days ago. After investigation, it was found that he had embezzled a total of 7,000 taels of relief funds. It was found that most of the money was spent in various gambling dens. Hua Yuzhang, a Suzhou native who was also responsible for collecting relief funds for the company, was also found to be colluding with him. They reported the incident to the General Police Station, which arrested Wang and Hua and sent them to the Special District Court the day before yesterday for investigation. Wang admitted that the money was lost by him alone in gambling and had nothing to do with Hua Yuzhang, and should not be implicated.

<p>Yu Di, the five-year-old son of Pan Tang, a woman from Jiangbei who lived in Chenjiaqiao in front of the South Railway Station, suddenly went missing a few days ago. The woman searched everywhere but could not find him. She knew he had been abducted and sold, but there was nothing she could do. However, the matter was entirely orchestrated by Zhang Chen, a neighbor, in collusion with Zhu Jucheng, Xu Liuzhong, and others. They abducted and sold the child and divided the money. Zhu and Xu questioned each other about how much they received in the Shanghai Military Camp Hotel. Xu received more than Zhu. They drank too much and forgot that they had committed a crime. They got into a fight with a police officer because of the unequal distribution of the money, and the case was exposed. They were arrested and taken to the First District, First Branch Police Station. The station chief ordered Zhang Chen to be arrested and taken into custody along with the others. Pan Tang was summoned for questioning and learned that she had been sold by these people. She demanded that the child be returned. Because the case involved enticement, it was transferred to the District Court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Workers Brawl</h3>
<p>Dispute Over Mud Baskets Leads to Conflict; Gang Leaders from Jiangbei Draw Blood</p>
<p>At the intersection of Route Tenant de la Tour and Route des Soeurs in the French Concession, a building of the Gao Da Company was nearing completion. The company hired two transportation vehicles, No. 16630 and No. 9658, from the Heyi Transportation Company on Beixizang Road to transport mud. The company sent more than 20 workers to work every day. Yesterday afternoon at around 3:30 PM, the workers from Shandong and Jiangbei gangs got into a fight over the placement of mud baskets. First, Liu Asan, from the Jiangbei gang, cursed when he mistakenly took someone else's basket, angering the Shandong gang. Each of them took sticks and struck Liu several times. Unable to resist, Liu fled inside and complained to his companions, who were furious and took sticks to rush out and fight. The two sides refused to give in to each other and fought for about a quarter of an hour. As a result, the Jiangbei gang was defeated due to their smaller numbers, but all of them suffered head injuries and bled. The foreman of the company came out to mediate and the fight subsided. Liu was seriously injured and feared for his life.</p>

About 500 people attended, including new and old members and male and female guests. Hu Pu'an, the Director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department and a graduate of the second class of the club, also took time out of his busy schedule to attend and joined the members in the competition, sparring twice with Zhao Diqi and Chen Fengmin. Mr. Hu's body was strong and his waist was flexible, which was amazing. Ms. Zhou Xiaofen sparred with the president of the club, Mr. Chen, in long fist and big movements. Her movements were light and her hands and feet were agile, and her posture was very beautiful. It is said that Ms. Zhou is also proficient in swordsmanship, having been taught by Mr. Li Jinglin. It is a pity that we did not see her perform. It is truly rare to find such skills among women.</p>
<h3>Fire at Taiyangmiao Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>At around 6 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out at No. 310 Taiyangmiao Road, Zhabei, at the Wanchun Sauce Garden owned by Hu Shaoshan, a native of Zhejiang. The fire spread quickly and completely destroyed the Zhenchang Long Smoke Paper Store, owned by Fang Xunnan at No. 312 next door. Fortunately, firefighters from various sections arrived at the scene and made great efforts to put out the fire. It took an hour to extinguish the fire. Hu Shaoshan was arrested by the Taiyangmiao Police Station of the Fourth District and taken to the station for investigation. It is said that the Zhenchang Long Smoke Paper Store had a fire insurance policy of 1,000 taels.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory issued a weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday, stating that the coastal areas of Shandong, the Yangtze River basin, and the coastal areas south of Ma'anshan would be cloudy with thunderstorms. There would be northerly winds over the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea. There were strong cyclones around the globe. The low pressure formed by Taiwan was moving in the northeast-east or northeast direction. Also, in the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in Shanghai was 72.9 degrees and the lowest was 62.8 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest temperature was 76.8 degrees and the lowest was 60.8 degrees.</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Xu Peikun's Plan to Relieve the Crisis of Gold Valuing Silver (Continued)</h3>
<p>Prohibit Foreign Banks from Issuing Paper Money</p>
<p>The proposal to prohibit foreign banks from issuing paper money is also a measure to relieve the current difficulties, but it can be included in our country's currency system reform plan.</p>
<p>(3) Restoration of Domestic Peace and Order and Development of Industrial and Commercial Enterprises</p>
<p>The restoration of domestic peace and order and the smooth operation of transportation institutions can indeed stabilize the national economy and allow the surplus silver in Shanghai to flow into the interior. The demand for silver in the interior can slightly consolidate the silver exchange rate in Shanghai. However, compared to the effects of the inflow of foreign silver and the speculation in the Gold Exchange, its effect is minimal. The development of industry and commerce throughout China requires a lot of silver, which can also stabilize the silver exchange rate in Shanghai. However, this is just a dream, and it will not have any impact until it is realized, which will not help the current crisis.</p>
<p>(4) Expanding the Use of Silver</p>
<p>Another school of thought has a unique view, advocating expanding the use of silver to maintain the silver exchange rate. The main points are to force the issuance of paper money with full silver reserves and to promote silver dollars and hard subsidiary coins. The difficulty of the first point is to change the long-standing habits and psychology of the banking industry in China's unsound financial system, which is difficult to achieve. The difficulty of the second point is that the cost of implementation by the government is too high, and the need for silver coins and hard subsidiary coins to circulate is not necessarily much more for the time being. Although the above two methods, if fully implemented, will have a good effect on the silver exchange rate, unfortunately, these relief measures are not the main solutions from the perspective of the current exchange rate turmoil.</p>
<p>(5) Establishing a Sino-Foreign Exchange Bank</p>
<p>The establishment of a Central Exchange Bank is another completely different suggestion. The author believes that this is an agency that should be established when implementing relief measures, but the bank itself cannot be regarded as a relief measure.</p>
<p>(6) Promoting Foreign Trade</p>
<p>Suggestions such as promoting export trade and reducing import trade can increase the demand for silver exchange and reduce the demand for gold coins, so it can also stabilize the silver exchange rate. However, these remedial measures are reliable, but they are too weak compared to other forces affecting the price of silver in China, and it is not possible to successfully correct the international trade deficit in a short period of time. It is still of no help to the current financial crisis that needs emergency relief.</p>
<p>(7) Prohibiting Cash Exports</p>
<p>The Cash Export Ban is a measure to resist the influx of foreign silver, using China as a tail and buying up China's cash to take away, and to suppress the price of gold in the Gold Exchange and make the price of silver firm.</p>
<p>(8) Prohibiting Silver Imports</p>
<p>The issuance of a silver import ban can immediately raise the price of silver and lower the price of gold. During the period when the ban is in effect, the order must be strictly enforced and can be lifted in a timely manner when it is no longer needed.</p>
<p>(9) Taxing Silver Imports</p>
<p>If a complete ban on silver imports is deemed impractical, then replacing the silver import ban with a silver import tax is also an expedient measure and is actually easier to implement. The height of this tax rate should be measured to be sufficient to compensate for the further decline in the selling price of silver. After a certain period of implementation (such as one year), the tax rate should be revised according to the situation at the time. In the author's opinion, a 50% silver import tax is not too high, and should be at least 30%. The above three points are the most effective relief measures, and any method can achieve perfect results. However, after the implementation of the three methods, the situation should be absolutely observed and revised at any time when there are changes. In order to achieve this goal, a management bureau should be created, which should be jointly organized by government officials, business people, and economists, and be given unlimited powers to manage the export and import of gold and silver, revise the silver import tax rate at any time, and supervise all related matters.</p>
<p>(10) Suppressing Speculative Gambling in Gold Exchanges and Gold Speculation Taxation</p>
<p>Furthermore, because the Gold Exchange is the central hub affecting changes in the silver exchange rate in Shanghai, how to deal with the exchange is also an important issue. Before examining the economic functions of the exchange in detail, it is not appropriate to make a hasty judgment on whether the exchange should exist. However, judging from the nature of the transactions in the exchange and the past experience of exchanges in major financial centers around the world, it is appropriate for gold transactions to be managed by official or semi-official management agencies. The members of the exchange should be responsible for providing daily records and all information on the purchase and sale of gold coins, such as the number of gold transactions and their prices. Manipulation, monopoly, or gambling should be absolutely prohibited, and those who violate the rules should be severely punished or detained, or both. Each gold transaction must be taxed, and when the number of transactions exceeds a certain number (such as 700), a progressive tax rate should be levied. The extension or delay of sales contracts should be restricted and taxed. In addition, all methods to reduce gambling-like transactions and protect speculation that conforms to economic principles should be considered and implemented.</p>
<p>(E) Conclusion: Taxing Silver Imports and Stopping Gold Gambling Can Preserve the Happiness of Millions of People</p>
<p>In short, the current exchange rate turmoil in Shanghai has its own causes and consequences, just like the exchange rate turmoil in foreign countries. The causes affecting the silver exchange rate in China have been explained above, and beginners have no way to know its mysteries. As for the effects of the current exchange rate turmoil that have already been felt, there are many, such as the soaring prices of goods and the bankruptcy of major merchants. However, the troubles that will arise in the future are just beginning and will be even more severe. If the people of the country do not care about the beginning of the turmoil, the period of brewing will be extended accordingly. If it is allowed to change without restraint, our country's foreign trade will be completely destroyed, and the source of the nation's economic life will be exhausted, leading to great disasters. In any country, when an exchange rate turmoil first arises, it should be quickly diagnosed and dealt with. The remedies used in various countries are actually the same as the above-mentioned points, so what is discussed here is not groundless and can achieve perfect results if it is adhered to. The National Government declared at the beginning of the exchange rate turmoil that it would prohibit the soaring price of gold and prohibit the import of foreign silver coins and the export of domestic gold. It seems extremely agile in dealing with current affairs. Although the author does not agree with its first method because it is difficult to implement and close to arbitrary, he sincerely prays for this entire timely relief policy to be implemented as soon as possible so that the residual situation can be turned from danger to safety. Is it not the happiness of millions of people? However, up to this day, we have only heard rumors and nothing else. The government's indefinite policies are suitable for the public to be uneasy and speculate. Moreover, the time from the beginning of the turmoil to the present is not short. The government's discussion of this issue has not been insufficient. Now, the main responsibility of the government is to actively implement the above proposals in order to protect the interests of the people of the whole country during the current turmoil. Taxing silver imports and adding regulations to the Gold Exchange is a more practical remedy, and if it is implemented, it will be enough to quickly improve the effect of a sea of silver exchange. How can the authorities ignore it? (The End)</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: Your newspaper's May 11th Shanghai News section contained an article about a new fraud case discovered by the Citizen's Bank, in which Zhang Weiyong and others were accused. It was found that Li Jingyuan's investment in the Citizen's Bank was based on a formal contract with Mr. Wu Ranbai, the general manager of our bank. The introducer was Ma Shuwan, and the witness was Yu Luqing. Li had no money and entrusted Mr. Wu to mortgage the house deed to a person named Liu (i.e., Qinghe Hall). The loan agreement also only had the introductions and testimonies of Mr. Ma and Mr. Yu. I was not the person who signed the contract, and my name was not on the list of introducers and witnesses. Li Jingyuan fabricated my name as the first defendant. Yesterday, the lawyer of the other party presented the contract in court and insisted that my name was on it. After asking him to look closely, he realized that my name was indeed not there. This kind of false accusation, in addition to filing a counterclaim accusing him of slander and demanding compensation for damages, I am especially writing a letter to slightly state the facts and ask you to publish this article as a correction to clarify the truth. I am very grateful. Sincerely, Zhang Weiyong, May 11th, addressed to the Shanghai News Editorial Department of Shen Bao.</p>

<h3>Mexico's New Proposed Citizenship Law</h3>
<p>Abolishing Remaining Foreign Titles, Stipulating Women's Nationality Status</p>
<p>Mexico City - The Mexican government is drafting a new citizenship law that will soon be submitted to Congress by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. One of the key points is that any Mexican who holds a Spanish or other title of nobility will lose their Mexican citizenship and nationality. This is because many Mexicans still use old Spanish aristocratic titles, such as "Marquis of San Francisco" and "Duke of Regran." The draft law states that "the majority of noble titles are tantamount to subjects paying homage to foreign rulers, and the payment of fees directly acknowledges foreign sovereignty. Those who desire a vain title and a foreign bond rather than the ordinariness of the national republic should be deprived of their nationality as a price." In addition, it stipulates that Mexican women who marry foreign men will be deemed to have lost their nationality. Foreign women who marry Mexican men can obtain Mexican citizenship without legal procedures. Children born in Mexico to foreign men and Mexican women shall be considered Mexican citizens, but illegitimate children are not included.</p>
<h3>Contents of the Report on the English Channel Tunnel Issue</h3>
<p>No problems in terms of engineering or geology, generally beneficial to England economically, can employ more than seven thousand workers, costing thirty million pounds</p>
<p>French public opinion has already introduced some aspects of the English Channel Tunnel construction issue yesterday. The following is a brief description of the contents of the British Committee's report:</p>
<p>The existence of this issue in British public opinion has exceeded eighty years. There are many reasons for opposition, the most powerful of which is an emotional reason. England has always been an island nation, so it has always regarded its geographical isolation as a national defense barrier. However, after the war, this attitude greatly changed, because the development of airplanes meant that no national boundaries could limit separation. This is a change in military opinion. There were also changes in economic factors that caused changes in public opinion. There were many unemployed people in England after the war, and both the government and the public felt that the plan to build a tunnel could be realized by employing many workers to solve part of the unemployment problem, and it was hoped that commerce with continental Europe would develop greatly.</p>
<p>On April 5th of last year, former Prime Minister Baldwin appointed a committee whose task was to "examine and report on the economic aspects of the proposal to build a Channel Tunnel or other means of crossing the Channel." It is important to note that all aspects other than the economic one were not mentioned. In essence, it was no longer a problem.</p>
<p>The committee deliberated for a year and has recently issued a report. Four of the five members of the committee supported the construction of the tunnel. According to what they believed, although some interests might be adversely affected as a result of the construction of the tunnel, England would generally gain economic benefits. Another member signed most of the report but did not agree with the conclusion of the four members. According to his opinion, the construction of the tunnel was possible, but it was not necessarily beneficial from an economic point of view.</p>
<p>The testimonies obtained by the committee from various parties were mixed and thought-provoking. The farmers in southern England were concerned that the opening of the tunnel would hinder their agriculture (the committee considered this concern to be unfounded). Chambers of Commerce generally supported the construction of the tunnel. Manufacturers were afraid that the result would encourage the import of foreign goods. Shipping companies were simply panicked by this plan and tried their best to oppose it.</p>
<p>The committee summarized the different opinions from all parties and decided on several main conclusions: Although there are various methods of crossing the English Channel, comparative research suggests that there is nothing better than building a tunnel. From the perspective of various evidences, the material and engineering difficulties are not worth worrying about. However, before eliminating all doubts, it is necessary to first open a "guide" tunnel, which costs 5.6 million pounds.</p>
<p>Once this "guide" tunnel is built, there is no problem in continuing to build a double-track railway tunnel. The operation and maintenance of the railway are also not difficult. The construction cost of this double-track tunnel is estimated at approximately 25 million pounds. The project should be entirely undertaken by private enterprise groups, and the government will not provide any subsidies. This can save construction costs, and the fares collected after the railway is opened can not exceed the rates currently charged by steamships.</p>
<p>As for the construction plans, there are two types. The committee approved one proposed by the "Channel Tunnel Company." The content is to build a tunnel 36 miles long, of which 24 miles are actually opened at the bottom of the English Channel, and the remaining 12 miles connect the tunnels along the coasts of both sides. According to the company's budget, the "guide" tunnel can be completed in two and a half years, and the double-track railway tunnel will take another four and a half years. The total construction cost of the two projects is approximately 30 million pounds as described above.</p>
<p>The section on hiring workers in the report is most important and is related to the unemployment problem. According to various consulting engineers, during the five-year construction of the "guide" tunnel, 1,000 workers can be directly and indirectly employed. During the three-year construction of the railway tunnel, 6,050 workers can be directly and indirectly employed. In response to this, there will be more than 3,000 employees of various shipping companies who will lose their jobs. However, this is after the tunnel project is completed, and there will be new jobs related to the tunnel after it is completed that can reabsorb the unemployed.</p>
<p>The release of the report did not completely solve the problem, but the British authorities can continue to consider it in practice. This is because the solution to the problem has taken a step forward.</p>
<h3>The United States Changes Cruiser Construction Plan</h3>
<p>Washington - With the approval of President Hoover, the U.S. Navy decided on the 3rd to temporarily suspend the construction of three major cruisers in order to actively change their structural content to cope with the competition of the ultra-speed, large cruisers of Britain, France, and Japan. The new construction plan is scheduled to be completed within a month, and then construction will be rushed. According to the original plan, these cruisers had a speed of 32 knots and were equipped with eight 8-inch guns and ten cannons. Now, because the French cruiser Duquesne has a speed of 35 knots and a newly built Japanese ship has a speed of 37 knots, major changes must be made to counter them. These three major cruisers will be equipped with nine 6-inch guns, six in the front and three in the rear. The three gun turrets will each mount three guns. The engine room will be particularly widened to develop greater speed. The smokestacks will be placed on the sides of the ship, freeing up space to accommodate four aircraft, previously only two.</p>
<h3>Mexican Invents a Method of Melting Lead into Silver</h3>
<p>Fearing for His Life, He Entrusts the Secret to a Notary</p>
<p>Mexico City - Mexican chemist José Esparza, who had previously been unknown, recently invented a method of melting lead into silver. In front of a group of journalists, he demonstrated the method on the spot. A molten lead liquid was mixed with a powder, and a metal was produced. Experts estimated that it was pure silver. José Esparza is unwilling to seek private gain from this invention and intends to contribute the secret to the Mexican government, believing that this method can produce large quantities of silver, and the world economic foundation will be shaken as a result. Therefore, he wants to assign his responsibility to the government. He also fears that someone will steal this secret, and his life is quite dangerous, so he wrote the secret into five copies, sealed them in five wax-sealed mail tubes, and handed them over to five notaries. If he is assassinated, the notaries will forward them to the Mexican president.</p>
<h3>Predictions of World Population in a Century</h3>
<p>Changxi</p>
<p>The Crisis of European Overpopulation</p>
<p>Many countries in the world are feeling the pain of overpopulation. International disputes have arisen over immigration and colonization policies. Except for France, other European countries are horrified by modern productivity. They believe that if the current productivity continues for a century, the population under the ground will be the same as in any urban area.</p>
<p>Therefore, Wolfgang von Lengerke of Germany systematically studied the crisis of European overpopulation. He said in the Illustrirte Zeitung of Leipzig: "One cannot vaguely fear the overpopulation of Europe, but should conduct an examination of the facts and then make scientific predictions for the future. The current total world population has soared to 1.95 billion. Europe has a total of 625 million, an average of 90,000 people per square kilometer. America has 127 million, an average of 52,000 per square kilometer. Asia has 130 million, an average of 43,000 people per square kilometer. Africa has 140 million, an average of 30,000 people per square kilometer. Australia has 80 million, an average of 8,000 people per square kilometer. From this rough statistic, Asia has its vast land to accommodate its people.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Republic of China, May 19th</p>
<p>America and Africa and Australia also have plenty of room to accommodate people, while Europe's area is relatively in second place in the world's total population. According to the proportion of each continent, Europe currently has a population of 625 million and can only accommodate up to 150 million. However, America has 147 million against 330 million, Asia has 130 million against 170 million, Africa has 140 million against 230 million, and Australia has 80 million against 7 million. But Europe has almost increased by 675 million. In a century, Europe will have no place to live.</p>
<p>However, although this danger of overpopulation is related to whether political changes will occur in the future, it is a certain fact in a century. The great powers of Europe are all competing for the development of colonies. In fact, they have not paid attention to the fundamental problem of overpopulation. In their efforts to expand outward, they still cannot prevent the surplus of the European population. In the past, Britain used the Americas as a colony, and France and the Netherlands both immigrated to the Americas. In fact, it only caused human wars and could not prevent the population from being too numerous. I don't know how to solve such a huge problem in the future. It requires scholars to study it. I hope my words are not a crazy theory worth further study.</p>
<p>After his theory was published, it aroused attention throughout Europe. The predictions based on scientific spirit are not unreasonable when the powers are paying attention to the wave of Asian colonization.</p>
<h3>Recent Statistics on the Population of All Australia</h3>
<p>According to a survey released by the Commonwealth Statistician of Australia, the total population of Australia on September 30, 1929, was 6,391,363. The natural increase from births exceeding deaths that year was 69,023. The number of immigrants exceeding emigrants was 11,880. As a result, the net increase was 80,911.</p>
<h3>The Eastern Report Records the Status of Sericulture in China</h3>
<p>Production Volume Increases, Cocoon Quality Improves, Becoming a Strong Enemy of Japanese Cocoons and Silk</p>
<p>According to the Eastern Report, sericulture in China has been completed around April 10th in Jiangsu Province and around April 20th in Zhejiang Province. Currently, the price of mulberry leaves is about nine to ten cents for 6 taels and 4 liang, and the price of cocoons is about three yuan for 6 taels and 4 liang, which is quite cost-effective. It is hoped that the production volume will increase significantly compared to last year, and the cocoon quality will also improve, becoming a strong enemy of Japanese silkworms and silk.</p>
<h3>Fake Medicines for Treating Tumors Are Popular in the American Market</h3>
<p>As Many as 100,000 Doses Are Sold Each Year, and Thousands Die Without Treatment</p>
<p>Washington - Dr. McDonough, a tumor expert at Ben Shewenyi University, recently testified at a hearing of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee that the only known cures for tumor pain are radium and surgery. No less than 100,000 doses of fake medicines are sold on the American market each year, causing great harm. Patients die as a result. The government should be asked to investigate and ban them and allocate funds to study the effective treatment of tumors in order to fundamentally help them.</p>

<h3>A Farewell Spring Outing Ming Guang</h3>
<p>A fire-like enthusiasm, the heavy rain could not extinguish it. We had already decided to brave the rain to Nanxiang. The spring light that was about to return would no longer stay for the tourists, and the falling petals would no longer linger on the branches. This would not allow us to hesitate any longer.</p>
<p>As a female classmate said, "Rainy days have their own scenery. What does it matter if our clothes are soaked? It's not worth it to let down the spring light." In fact, this did not need encouragement. This spring is the time for moving outings, especially for this group locked in a cage. Who would be willing to let go of such a magical opportunity? So, this farewell spring outing was put together.</p>
<p>Eighteen young people full of life, the women were dressed in colorful spring clothes, bright and harmonious. Taking advantage of the misty spring rain, they sat in a car to Nanxiang. The sound of rain mixed with singing, harmonizing with the heavy rhythm of the wheels. Laughter filled the carriage. Slowly, Shanghai became more distant. The people who were tired of city life, this green wilderness gave us a lot of fresh meaning. We were all trying our best to collect this fading spring color.</p>
<p>After all, the sky was not intentionally making things difficult for us. If you don't believe me, look, the rain stopped before we arrived in Nanxiang. By the time we got off the car and walked on the Nanxiang road, the sun was shining in the sky. Walking on the muddy road with accumulated water and the fragrant grass after the rain gave people infinite joy. So, this long section of muddy road to Wang Garden did not tire us at all. We finally stood before the amiable garden owner.</p>
<p>The yachts lying on the shallow beach were a great temptation for us. A bay of quiet green water was flanked by lush trees. After the rain, they were especially verdant. We immediately imagined the fun of floating on this clear water in small boats. Without a moment's rest, we sat in four small boats and floated on the water.</p>
<p>The timid were finally overcome by curiosity. Although it was said that playing on the water was dangerous, what were young people afraid of? Fortunately, those who knew how to row sat in a boat, and soon they rowed out of the harbor. Unfortunately, a boat that did not know how to row very well was not very fateful and drifted, kissing the mud bank on the east and then kissing the one on the west. So, the four small boats were scattered in this green water.</p>
<p>The small boats left the harbor, and the competition began. The small oars went up and down, stirring the green waves in an orderly and rhythmic way. The laughter on the water followed the boats, carrying us forward. The singing and laughter spread across the river, scaring away the fish in the water and the orioles on the shore. Those in the back were chasing those in the front, and those in the front were laughing at those in the back. Those who were laughed at attacked those who were laughing by splashing water, but those who were laughing ran away, waving their small oars. This kind of noise woke up the silent stream.</p>
<p>The willow leaves gently brushing the water surface swayed with the light wind. The boats rowing too fast could not avoid them for a moment and went into the silky weeping willows, covering the boats like colorful ribbons at a meeting. Everyone peered through the gaps, blurring like in a fog. So, they rested under the shade of the willows, sharing the candy they had brought. From afar, they heard the boatman's song, knowing that a boat was coming, and greeted them loudly, throwing the candy over. Those that could not be thrown fell into the water, and those who did not receive it looked sadly at the gradually sinking candy. So, those throwing laughed wildly again.</p>
<p>After turning two bays, they saw a flat bridge that could be pulled up. Two white geese were slowly swimming under the bridge. A cluster of roses was in full bloom on the shore, and a cluster reflected in the water was shattered by the waves, and the scattered petals spread flat on the water, also following the waves, refusing to float closer to us. The geese ran away when they saw us.</p>
<p>The twilight gradually deepened. The setting sun that was about to pass spilled through the trees and onto the river surface, making the stream extraordinarily green. The trees on both sides were also extraordinarily verdant. When the small boats met, everyone asked if they were going ashore, but no one went up. This moment of sunset finally disappeared in the vast twilight. This nostalgic yacht finally had to say goodbye to us. When we all rowed close to the shore, we only heard singing and did not see the boat.</p>
<p>This farewell spring outing passed like a dream. From now on, it will give us a lot of distant memories. However, this is definitely worth remembering because there was a complete outpouring of true feelings. So, sing when you want to sing, and laugh when you want to laugh. It was all a display of naturalness, with no hypocrisy or theatrical pretense. I feel that only this is the true meaning of our lives.</p>
<h3>Musical Sounds on Jiaozhou Road</h3>
<p>Where Confucius sang and played the zither, now only a land of mutton and blood. Across the water, in the felt tent villages, the setting sun sees cattle and sheep descending. A region freed from chaos, look, a famous king hunts at night, torches light up a thousand streams. The distant cries of barbarian drums are startling. Thinking of the arrow in my quiver, the sword in its scabbard, all covered in dust and decay, what has become of it all... I hear that the surviving elders of the Central Plains constantly gaze south, hoping for the imperial banners and regalia to arrive. When travelers reach this place, their hearts fill with righteous indignation and tears flow freely. - Zhang Xiaoxiang's "Tune: Head of Six Prefectures"</p>
<p>When the noble sons and daughters, freshly arrived at D University, awoke from their drowsy, sweet-smelling dreams of spring, they often heard a kind of soul-stirring music transmitted from the West. This music had a rapid tempo that harmonized with the heartstrings. This music had the power of Beethoven to move the men of Vienna, stirring the spring thoughts of the sons and daughters. It even had the strength of Rouget de Lisle's "Marseillaise" to rouse the hot blood of French revolutionary warriors, stirring the hot blood of the sons and daughters. How subtle and great it was for these fortunate sons and daughters to hear such music.</p>
<p>However, the sons and daughters were always awake.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when the sons and daughters' emotions changed, they would develop a kind of hateful attitude towards this music. When a son felt annoyed, he would say angrily, "The more vigorously this music is played, the more distressed I feel." The daughters, of course, were just as intelligent and had hearing no worse than the sons, so they inevitably felt some resentment when they heard it. As they walked along the palace road, each step was like a needle piercing their tender hearts. However, they might not have expressed it, only understanding it in their hearts.</p>
<p>One day, a son and a daughter met and began talking about this matter.</p>
<p>The son said, "I remember that when Xiang Yu, the King of Chu, heard the songs of Chu on all sides, he committed suicide on the Wujiang River. It seems that Chu was not defeated by his lack of courage, but by music that paralyzed the hearts of the people." The daughter said, "That's not entirely true. Didn't Yu Ji's song spur Xiang Yu's courage into rash action?"</p>
<p>The son said, "That is true, so music is indeed moving. If a person is stimulated in their heart by music that most easily stirs emotions and shows no reaction, that person is simply too numb."</p>
<p>The daughter said, "Even if music is not moving, saying someone is numb is something I do not believe."</p>
<p>The son said, "If we discover foreign tunes being played and sung in our palace, isn't that the same as having many foreigners arguing and scolding each other in our palace?"</p>
<p>The daughter said, "Yes, but our eardrums have no ability to reject hearing foreign tunes."</p>
<p>The son said, "However, when Emperor Wu of Han was trapped by the Xiongnu, he heard the Xiongnu's barbarian reed pipes playing every day. Emperor Wu had no way to deal with it. This situation must have caused Emperor Wu some distress. Now we are leaning on the railings, quietly listening to the sounds of Jiaozhou, and our situation is no less difficult than it was then."</p>
<p>The son spoke and sighed deeply. The daughter was also at a loss. A few days later, the son and daughter saw many foreign yellow wolves scurrying around the palace, fierce and extraordinary. The son and daughter had no way to deal with them and did not dare to stop them for a moment, fearing that if they failed to stop them, they would be bitten and injured. A small act of carelessness could ruin a great plan. The son and daughter had both been taught by their elders and understood everything very well, so they could only suppress their hot blood and wait quietly, wait quietly.</p>
<p>Day after day, the son and daughter saw the man-eating yellow wolves and the stinging music. Because they adhered to the teachings and remained quiet, quiet, the blood and tears in their hearts could only flow back and forth within them.</p>
<p>Later, the sons and daughters heard that they would soon be moving out of the palace. They were very happy because they would no longer see the yellow wolves or hear the music.</p>
<p>However, someone said, "Although the sons and daughters have moved from this palace road, there will always be someone living there, so these yellow wolves and this music will always be seen and heard by someone. Perhaps their feelings will not be as intense as those of the sons and daughters. At the same time, they might even think it is pleasing to the eye and ear."</p>
<p>Therefore, the prophet said, "These yellow wolves and this music will not cause any problems on this road for the next few years and will certainly be able to scurry and sing very peacefully."</p>

<h3>The Story of World Literature (1) (5) (0)</h3>
<p>Written by John Macy, American, translated by Hu Zhongchi</p>
<p>Chapter 38: Nineteenth-Century French Poetry</p>
<p>Lake, it has been almost a year since I last visited.</p>
<p>Now is the time to appreciate the familiar waves near here, which she used to admire.</p>
<p>Look, I sit alone on this rock.</p>
<p>You know this rock is exactly where she used to sit. At that time, you were also like this, gurgling in this crevice. You were also like this, splashing on this rock.</p>
<p>The drifting foam was also like this, falling on the beach,</p>
<p>falling on the beach where her feet once stepped.</p>
<p>Another innovator was Alfred de Vigny, who became known to English readers through his historical novel "Cinq-Mars." His initial collection of poems, "Poems Ancient and Modern," had the originality that was demanded of it, taking the form of drama and stories with philosophical themes. He did not limit himself to poems of his youth, and therefore had great significance in the development of French poetry. As he grew older, his poems continued to become more profound in thought and clearer in form. These new poets, under the guidance of Chateaubriand, were generally religious. However, de Vigny's religion was still rational in the eighteenth-century sense. Lamartine's God was the Father of Sorrows; de Vigny's was the God of Thought.</p>
<p>The only true God, the strong God, is the God of Thought.</p>
<p>On our foreheads, where chance scatters seeds,</p>
<p>Let knowledge develop and become a fertile stream. After a while, let us gather the fruits born from the soul, soaked in the fragrance of sacred solitude.</p>
<p>Let us throw these fruits into the sea, the sea of humanity.</p>
<p>God will use his finger to take them and guide them to port. The king of poets was Victor Hugo, who maintained his throne for fifty years. The diversity and richness of his works are hard to believe. The later critical tendency to underestimate his stature is partly a protest against his quantity. Hugo's dramas were very popular. "The King's Amusement," banned by King Louis Philippe after its initial performance, he lived to see it reopened fifty years later amid thunderous applause. And even today, almost a century after these dramas were written, the Comédie-Française hardly has a week without performing "Hernani" or "Ruy Blas." Hugo's dramas do not have much in the way of realistic characterization or structural simplicity, but the story "moves" and the lines are filled with beautiful rhetoric that often reaches extremely high poetic levels.</p>
<p>Hugo's dramas, despite their fervent rhetoric, began to lose vitality. As mentioned before, his prose had more lasting vitality (although modern French critics undervalue it). Prose romances, even when written with fiery language and filled with false situations, are closer to life and freer from theatrical affectation than similarly dramatic plays. And I believe that immortality is even more certainly stamped upon the best of Hugo's lyric poems and narrative poems. He was a great singer, and the saying that "the song comes from the singer" is true, if it is true of anyone, then it is true of him. Between his dramas and romances appeared volume after volume of short poems, and within these short poems (many of which are very long) appeared the soul of the man. He could modulate the lyric verse to praise an infant or curse a king. He was read and admired by many English poets, so many of his poems were translated into English. However, those translations are mostly too long to be quoted within our limited scope. The following roughly translated poem shows one aspect of his belief:</p>
<p>The child sings, the mother is tired to the utmost in bed,</p>
<p>going to die, her fair brows are above the ghosts.</p>
<p>Dying in the snow, above her soared,</p>
<p>I heard the death rattle and heard the child's song.</p>
<p>The child is five years old, near the window,</p>
<p>his laughter and playing sounds make lovely sounds, and the mother is coughing slightly in the dim night next to the</p>
<p>pitiful, lovely thing that sang all day. The mother went to rest under the stones of the monastery,</p>
<p>and the child sang again.</p>
<p>Sorrow is a fruit that God does not allow to</p>
<p>grow on branches that are so delicate that they have no strength to support it. This somewhat movingly illustrates Hugo's belief in the goodness of God and the victory of life, a belief he maintained before many distressing experiences. This set him apart from his misanthropic contemporaries and combined with a great sense of pity, a sense of pity that permeated all his works, even when they became theatrical and flamboyant. The whole world, including those who seek flaws in his art and disapprove of his political views, respects the man.</p>
<p>Doubt or hope cannot bend</p>
<p>the tallest head of the earth that sees straight to the end.</p>
