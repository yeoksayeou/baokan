<p>時評</p>
<h3>飛船建築業之福音</h3>
<p>世界無論何事。經一次犧牲。必獲一次良果。經一次失敗。必獲一次敎訓。故曰失敗者成功之母也。世界製造機械之發明。至於今日。不知其擲無數次之犧牲。經無數次之失敗。前仆後繼。奮進不已。乃能精而又精。脫危險而入於安全。去簡陋而進於美備。追溯原始。無一非以前犧牲失敗者之功也。此次英飛船Ｒ一○一號之失事。非特爲物質上之大犧牲。且爲學問智識界之大犧牲。專門人才之大犧牲。英國不幸而遇此重大損失。誠可痛惜。然因此損失。進而研究其致禍之故。知由於輕氣易燃不可恃。又進而研求所以替代之物。知惟有氦氣爲不易燃。然又爲美國所獨占。而不能公之於各國。今者愛沙尼亞已發現鉅量之氦氣。足以供給英德飛船建築業之用。使其說果確。誠不失爲世界之大貢獻。英雖擲此鉅大犧牲。然因此一犧牲。而所以保全於今後之世界者甚多。豈非失敗即成功之母哉。</p>
<p>吾國科學之無進步。機械製造之無發明。固無可諱言矣。然在此世界發明成功之際。吾人追踪而倣效之。不難事半而功倍。今果欲立國於世界之林。着手於凡百建設之事業。捨此奮鬥努力其奚由。</p>

<h3>中國女子體育曁南大學體育部主任（二）陳掌諤</h3>
<p>我們欲培養小孩子做成完全人格、亦是有五要素、第一就是美育、設有一位女士、他的姿勢和體格、都很出羣衣服很麗都、我想没有不注意那位女士的、没有人不贊慕那位女士的、没有人不要親近那位女士的、所以美麗可以壯觀、那麽美育就是造成人格的重要問題、第二就是羣育、這個羣育兩字、亦是人生極重要的、閱者諸位想以較早的人、如孔子耶穌林肯近的爲威耳順、孫中山先生没有人不崇拜他、這是甚麽緣故呢、這是因爲他們大公無私博愛好羣、以天下爲公、以自由平等爲本、所以現時世界上各敎育家、莫不以體育爲訓育之要道、第三就是智育、這個智育兩字就是諸位在學校時、研究的種種的智識、人生在兒童的時代、由我們的家長送入學校、幼雅園由幼雅園升入中小學、而大學、待卒業出校、就可到社會裡去作種種事業、所以智育是爲人生處世接物、和建功立業的要素、</p>
<p>第四就是德育、譬如某位女士、是某著名大學卒業生、她是活潑和美麗、在社會受着許多人的歡迎、社會人士没有一人不愛敬她的、這位的女士就算有了以上的美育智育羣育的資格、但是她的人格不好、道德很壞、信用全無、無惡不作、總是她仍可藉她的才智、跑進社會裡去、做出種種罪惡的事、這麽一來、她的名譽和人格、不久就會給人家宣告破產、爲社會人事所輕、假使這位女士的道德、極爲高尙、極知廉恥、極其清白、社會人士永遠愛戴她、那個敢藐視伊呢、就女士個人的方面、亦前途遠大、不致墜落、可見道德是人生最重要的、第五就是體育、現時說到我們欲討論的問題了、假使這位女士有了美育智育羣育和德育、總可算人格完善總到社會裡去幹功立業、但是他被風吹、就動弱不勝衣的女子、一年三百六十天、差不多三百天、都病在床上、照這樣看來、任她有極好的本領、恐怕没有精神和體力去做事、好像一座高宏壯麗的大樓、建設在散沙的上面罷、所以女界們要成完全人格、不但要注重美羣智德四育、還須注重體育注重體育、有三大效果、請加以說明如下、</p>
<p>（一）個人丨個人注重體育她的效果、有以下三種、</p>
<p>第一種　關於身體上丨身體强壯資式端正、内臟發達、壽齡延長、</p>
<p>第二種　關於智育上丨敏捷自决感覺靈敏、記憶健全、</p>
<p>第三種　關於德育上丨忍耐自重毅力、涵養高尙、</p>
<p>（二）社會丨注重體育的效果、能到利益社會人羣、矯正風俗、融和人羣感情、鞏固社會秩序、</p>
<p>（三）黨國丨注重體育的效果、尤爲宏大關於黨國、注重體育一點、尤爲吾人不可不注重的一件事、就是可以得著以下的盡忠自由·合作·服從·樂觀·勇敢·犧牲·各種的效果、自我國統一以來、國民政府諸要人、對於女子體育、竭力提倡、如去年全國運動大會中、對於女子體育及各種運動、收效偉大、總之、體育之目的有三、（未完）</p>

<h3>付之一笑</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>▲婦人（到一監獄中去見獄官）！官長。求你可憐見我們的一家老小。放了我的丈夫吧。</p>
<p>獄官—你的丈夫是犯了。甚麽罪關進來的。</p>
<p>婦人—他這人太不長進了。不去做工掙錢。却偷了人家兩隻火腿。</p>
<p>獄官—他旣是如此不長進。你要他放回去做甚。</p>
<p>婦人—因爲上次偷來的火腿。我們已吃完了。</p>
<p>▲子—父親。你肯買一個喇叭給我麽。</p>
<p>父—我不願買給你。料知你一有了喇叭。便又整日的吹着。閙得人甚麽似的。</p>
<p>子—父親。這不打緊。我夜夜等你睡後吹好了。</p>
<p>▲甲—老Ｃ說你昨天和他相打。咬掉了他臂上的一塊肉。他預備向法庭起訴。</p>
<p>乙—你不要相信他的話。我已吃了十年的長素了。决不肯輕易開葷。</p>
<p>▲妻（歸寗了半個月。回到夫家。問伊的丈夫。）親愛的。我回去了半個月。你怎麽樣料理家事。</p>
<p>夫—我只在家裏住了一夜。就住到旅館裏去。</p>
<p>妻—可是爲了寂寞之故。</p>
<p>夫—不是的。只爲在床上睡了一夜。被褥都攪亂了。第二天没有人給我鋪床。</p>
<h3>聽講拾零</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>中華職業敎育社於上月二十七日星期六下午三時舉行第二次學術演講。登台人物一爲婦人節制協會宣傳部主任楊美貞女士。講節制是救國的工具。一爲國立同濟大學校長胡庶華先生。講中國鋼鐵業衰落之原因。及將來應取之方針。講時頗多趣屑。因誌之如次。</p>
<p>▲楊女士高呼打倒小老婆　楊女士年約二十許。儀容端莊。操極純熟之國語。講烟酒賭三者足以消磨青年之志氣。耗錢傷人。敗家亡國。應該以有用的思想。以有用的精神金錢。去做有益的事業。提倡正當的娱樂。或聽音樂。或開留聲機。以快胸襟。節制是人人該從不吸烟不飲酒不賭博做起。全國一致的起來努力節制運動。末謂家庭中男子不得娶妾。厲行一夫一妻制度。大呼打倒小老婆不置。聞者粲然。</p>
<p>▲胡校長大談鋼鐵新政策　前上海鍊鋼廠長胡庶華先生。于思滿頰。酷類美髯公。演講中國有富饒之鐵鑛。不能自闢利源坐視日人佔據遼寗省之本溪湖鞍山弓長嶺等處之豐富鐵鑛。又以市上廢鐵被外人操縱收買。無大規模工廠抵制。致全國鐵路材料完全仰求外洋。每年進口約六萬噸。損失鉅萬。我國僅有之鋼鐵廠。因缺乏人才。借用客卿。不料外人只知用其本國原料。不管中國有無鐵鑛。故辦鋼鐵事業。迫不得已。而用客卿。不要上外人的當。將來應取方針。國家宜實行鋼鐵政策。鋼鐵政策的物質建設。應人人從心理建設做起。不是鍊鋼鐵來戰爭的。先生演說時。頻頻拱手。狀甚謙遜。</p>
<p>計是日聽講之男女達百餘人。均目不轉瞬。注視講台。亦足見名人演講之不同凡響矣。</p>
<h3>國慶騰歡中之趣屑</h3>
<p>— 程志政</p>
<p>歡騰熱烈的國慶。轉眼又過去了。那天各處都有慶祝會。而交通大學的更來得别緻有趣。追述一二。以告讀者。</p>
<p>▲兩小姐求婚　向來。交通大學的女生。是不輕易加入什麽游藝會的。也許爲了國慶。所以有兩位狠熱心的女同學出來打破了以前的沉寂。一位是鼎鼎大名的陶蒓女士。一位是以交際擅長演說出名的王亨齡女士。表漢的一齣歌舞劇「畫中人。」自始至終。伊們歌着舞着。陶小姐穿了一件金色的長袍。更覺得儀態萬方。伊倆所唱的。好似Sunny　Side　up中的一叚。最後王小姐跪在陶小姐面前求婚了、大家不期而起了一陣熱烈的彩聲。</p>
<p>▲好大的脾氣　老同學張善琨夫人。就是從前在乾坤大劇塲的女呌天。自從于歸張君。久已絶跡歌塲。國慶日張君因母校關係。特約其夫人同來會串落馬湖。夫人串的是黃天覇。張君是酒保。出台時伉儷相見。不覺彼此一笑。黃天覇要喝酒。聰明的酒保忙拿上來。但不肯斟到他（伊）杯裏。天覇非斟不可。于是把案一拍。問他到底怎樣。酒保却慌了。說。何必發脾氣。即忙陪笑斟上。引起大家鬨堂大笑。還不知劇情是如此呢。還不知是張君閨闥中眞情的流露。</p>
<p>▲代表大會的空頭支票　節目上原來有一齣方言表演。是大四同學擔保的。方法是將各省地的同學。在表演開代表大會的時候。各說各的土話。原是一件極有趣味的事。而交大三日刋上也加以鼓吹。豈知自始至終。代表大會是銷聲匿跡。不知爲着什麽而變爲一張空頭支票。晚上全是京劇。表演的如鍾啓英。徐厚。吳承炳等。都有顯著的進步。這一點是值得慶賀的。</p>
<p>▲文治堂中大開筵席　校長孫哲生黎曜生二氏。爲慶祝國慶起見。特設席文治堂。歡宴全體敎職員和學生代表。談談說說。吃吃笑笑。也是國慶中的可紀念的盛會</p>
<h3>國慶日申商彩追排記</h3>
<p>— 老拙</p>
<p>比來皮簧盛行。海上之票社接踵而起者。頗如雨後春筍。南京路之申商俱樂部。於上月間附設京劇部以來。以地點適中。佈置完善。見稱於時。雙十國慶日。乃特舉行彩排。以誌慶祝。爰將是日所觀各劇。略誌如下。屠君開徵之白水灘。是劇昔年李春來之十一郎。與小奎官之青面虎。冠絶儕輩。屠君專力趨步春來。功候綦深。表演十一郎懷才不遇。抑鬱牢騷。藉路遇不平事。打抱不平。以發洩其胸中鬱悶不平之氣。此節演來。十分透足。開打時之札槍舞棍。亦殊緊練動觀。不愧老資格也。戎君伯銘之貴妃醉酒。兩叚探海臥魚姿勢。甚見功夫。幾節平調。亦如流鶯百囀。悅耳之至。張君中原之打嚴嵩。摹仿麒麟童。頗能妙肖。尤君菊生之鳳凰山。氣足神完。則又近似壯年之李吉瑞也。徐君再英之烏龍院。所歌平調。甚覺掛味。董君芝初賀君其良張君渭鳴李君傳能合演天水關。董亦海上老票。向唱鬚生。因久未登台。是日忽興會飇發。串演小生。逼緊喉關。作尖脆之聲浪。頗覺風趣。亦游戲云爾。賀君飾孔明。則一板三眼。認眞從事。張君飾姜維。久歷疆塲。功候老到。李君飾趙雲。雖係初次出塲。郤能稱職。大軸李君白水之一捧雪。接演審頭刺湯。一捧雪飾莫成。刺湯飾陸秉。陸秉設計折服湯裱褙。以及委曲成全雪艶之節操。做工念白。均極細緻縝密。洵稱能手。關君鴻賓飾湯裱褙。形容湯丑種種醜態。刻畫入微。徐美雲女士飾雪艶。歌二簧慢板一節。歌喉旣佳。益以詞句之悲楚。倍覺聲聲動聽。劇罷已鐘鳴二下。歸而爲之記。是亦慶祝聲中之一段劇話足述也。</p>
<h3>秋聲拾錦</h3>
<p>— 爽秋</p>
<p>硃㾗記即全本牧羊卷。各塲均有精采。無一閒筆。其中如朱春登代叔從軍一塲。先開家庭會議。將各人心事一一描出。而後由趙氏提議决定宋氏之悍。宋成之㚥。春登之義。趙氏之賢。均於此塲揭開。預爲後文伏線。機括甚緊。而會議時面面相覷。針鋒相對。煞是可觀。艶秋飾趙氏。會議時之勇斷。磨房中之機警。以及牧羊山饑寒交迫。姑媳相隨。旣已自悲身世。復又强笑承歡。賢孝心情。曲曲如繪。而遇風盤旋。兎起鶻落。姿態雋妙。如身在荒山風雪中。目覩此無告之人。顚沛流離。爲狀至慘。眞不知涕泗之何從也。磨房中唱南梆子。無限哀怨。而責駡宋成之快板。又聲情激越。牧羊山二黃一叚。千迴百轉。而收縱自如。韓子論文。謂氣盛則言之長短。聲之高下皆宜。艶秋得此宜其名不虚傳也。蓆棚討飯一塲。唱工聚精會神。十分圓滿。趙景賢跪蓆棚珠淚滿面一句倒板。婉轉悠揚。得未曾有。以下尊侯爺之慢板行腔。曲折有致。元板唱至配兒夫朱春登句時。中軍持刀恫嚇之跪步身叚絶佳。無與倫比。轉二六且唱且作之姿態。極目送手揮之妙。哭頭侯爺呀聲調之凄凉。恰將一腔苦衷於此句腔調中充分表出。餘如乃姑碎碗騐手之做派。恰將驚懼神色刻畫盡致。入蓆棚乍見朱春登時。知爲已夫欲認又不敢認之神態。大佳特佳。作工之體貼入微。殆無過是者。</p>
<p>寳蓮燈之王桂英。乃宰相之女狀元之妻。演員如稍不留意。往往失其身分。艶秋此劇之佳。不可言喻。台步神情。婀娜中能不失莊重。眞難能可貴也。</p>
<h3>意大利美術考察記（二）</h3>
<p>— 汪亞塵</p>
<p>該館陳列繪畫。皆在三層樓。共分左右二大走廊。其廊長約一里餘。（中國里）廊之通路處置名雕原作。每隔數步。分陳其一。走廊右面。皆可入繪畫陳列室。自第一室至二十六室。皆文藝復興前後之名作。此外尙有近代繪畫及外國部名畫數室。余此次入意大利。專爲研究古代繪畫。在奥飛次連看二日。茲將意大利之名作。簡記於下。</p>
<p>鮑督西里Botticelli之名作「美神誕生」及「春」兩幀。皆陳列檯内。鮑氏是文藝復興繪畫的先驅。後來拉飛耳受他的影響處甚大。鮑氏繪「美神誕生」一畫。原來根據寫實。兼用其自身豐富的理想與美的情操。一變而爲夢幻的美。用色似寳石。感覺明快。畫幅的優雅與媚艶。已表出人間感情的極致了。那幅「春」的描寫。全用象徵春的情調。在百花繚亂的園林中。畫一羣少女舞蹈。表出人間歡樂的極致。這兩幅畫。雖有生彩。但隱隱中有一種世紀末爛熟欲頽的哀愁泛溢着。然而有鮑氏的唯美主義的繪畫。後來出了一位拉飛耳就從他的這種感覺的陶醉的形體上生出來的。英國十七世紀所謂拉飛耳前派的繪畫。也根據於鮑氏的藝術而起。所以鮑督西里的藝術。影響於後人極大。上述兩幅。是他最可代表的作品。其餘尙有不少佳作。姑從略之。</p>
<p>拉飛耳Raphael之繪。計二十餘幅。陳列一巨室。室以紅緞裝裱。拉飛耳是時代的寵兒。文藝復興期三傑之一。他雖只有三十七年的短生命。可是留下的作品最多。屏畫之外。描寫當時敎皇及貴族。肖像等作品。該室有一幅紅衣敎皇像。是拉氏的精品。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（二九四）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　翠竹淚斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離</p>
<p>阿金正要趁勢探他的口風。便道。有人說。老爺外面討了姨太太。借了小房子。不知道這話眞不眞。根生做了一種狡獪的笑道。老爺討姨太太。與你什麽相干。難道要你吃醋不成。阿金用拳頭搥了他一下道。放屁。你不要亂嚼咀。壞了人家的名譽。我因爲聽得人家說。老爺外面有小公館。你是和老爺一隻褲脚管裏的人。老爺白相。你也趁此搭搭趣。終有一天穿綳了。太太曉得。不但生意停脫。還怕要吃耳光咧。那個根生。這天也喝了口黃湯。便乘着酒興。算是討好阿金的。便道。别人面前。我再也不說出去。你是自己人。告訴你。你切不可給别人說起。尤其是雌老虎前。切不可露出口風。老爺新討了一位姨太太。是堂子裏的倌人。比了此地的太太。好好兒的要加幾倍的標緻。又是文靜。又是脾氣好。對於我們。眞是一點也不搭架子。伊常常笑容滿面的問我大公館裏的事。背後也稱太太怎麽樣。二少爺怎麽樣。一塊兩塊錢。伊又常常給我們的。阿金道。唔。原來到底是有小房子在外面。怪道常常深更半夜回來。有一回。說到青島去。只怕也是說鬼話吧。根生道。魂也不曾到青島去。到青島去。還是余舅老爺想出來的主意咧。敎我們老爺說到青島去。至少不回家裏去十天。阿金說是余舅老爺不是我們太太的哥哥嗎。怎麽不帮着自己的妹子。反帮着妹夫出主意。說鬼話。根生道。告訴你吧。男人總是帮男人。女人總是帮女人的。阿哥妹子都是不相干的。阿金道。所以你在外面總是帮着老爺的。給老爺說鬼話。我在家裏。自然也是帮着太太的。我要把這事告訴太太。讓他們吵一塲。根生連忙陪笑道。這個洋濫污萬萬撒不得。那我不但是停生意。眞個要吃耳光。而且以後也不能和你常聚的了。阿金道。這樣的膽小。幾句話把你的臉也嚇黃了。現在我且不說。你以後再要和我强兇霸道。我以後就一搭刮子說出來。說老爺的討姨太太。都是根生拉的皮條。看你吃得消。吃弗消。阿金得着這個消息。太太面前。果然一字不提。在同夥中。却偶然露出口風。廚房間和門房間。是男女傭人的俱樂部議事廳。這個地方。便是談論他們主人的塲所。不到幾天。傭人們都確切知道老爺外面有小公館了。</p>

<p>▲平和的開盤　自早晨十一月份初開五百六十四兩四錢、計加四錢、（惟毛盤到過四兩以内）嗣大條又加十六分之一、銀價加八分之三、惟匯兌降十六分之一、人心尙穩、不爲所動、嗣後由六十四兩二錢加至五兩九錢、乃志豐永天裕永益餘森昌永等買進、又匯票亦堅、三井買近期大連一兩二錢五分五、遠期英金銀行互做七辨士五六二五、惟至先令揭佈時爲六十五兩三四錢、掛牌未更、茲由住友出下月日金一兩二錢五分二五、且恒興等售出、遂降至六十四兩五錢、入後住友又出、美金三十九元五、和囒買元月份三十九元十六分之十一、場上買户猶多、故十點廿餘分爲六十六兩、越半小時减去一兩、計五兩左右、以後市面和緩之象、十一月英金可結一七五六二五、直至十一點半後協裕春發永等紛紛迨進、茲已映上二兩、至十一點三刻達六十七兩、迨正午收盤六十六兩二錢、因恒興等出售復又退落數錢、揭價仍爲六百十兩零二錢、計撳四十四五兩、</p>
<p>▲晚收計漲五兩六　後市開盤六十六兩一錢、嗣因太康潤買進、遂加一兩半、二點十餘分爲七兩六錢、時又减小五六錢、二點半至三點時略有四五錢上落、以在七兩四五錢、人後忽因開做掉期、致被拉高、尤由大户太興大德成太亨源等奮勇而進、爰人心大振、跳三兩、惟三點至四點時略計五六錢盤旋、迨四點時計達七十兩、轉瞬多頭脫手、抑小兩許、迨四點半收市復加至六十九兩六錢、（續又抬至七十兩光景）、比前日計漲五兩六錢、查一日間最大價七十兩、最小價六十四兩一錢、相去五兩九兩、揭價計撳四十四兩至四十一兩、登賬本月七十兩、下月六十六兩、補水七十兩、下午七十四兩、物品早開四兩三錢、午收五兩八錢、下午六兩四錢、收市七十兩、</p>
<p>▲交易出入靡常　各號交易計天裕永·元大永·昌升永·春源永·春發永·元興永·源成·永康·大德成·及套頭物品條子等均已買進、恒興、生大·元亨·福昌·兩興·順利·萬興·元成永等均是售出、協裕·義豐永·福餘·元茂永·等先出後進志豐永餘大森者永等出入靡常、下午泰潤·天裕永·泰興·大德成·元成永·太亨源·等均進順利萬興元成永等時有選出、恒興生火春源永及散户等稍有售出、大連帮出一千多條、買二三百條、廣帮共出二千條云</p>
<h3>外匯内盤趨佳</h3>
<p>昨海外銀市繼續升漲、惟匯兌見降、横濱神户市均無升降、匯豐掛牌各匯均無變化、惟内盤似乎略佳、實因標金已見上升也、但自晨至午並無特殊更動、趨勢和平、迨結果比較十四日計英金縮零六二五、美金縮一八七五、日金漲上三七五、午後因值週三、向例無市、華商稍有買進、然交易不甚濃厚、計英金成交十萬鎊、間有銀行互做幾萬鎊、又住友興業臺灣有利等有所售出、係由金業中套回條子焉、又美金曾結一二十萬元、亦有售出若干萬元、至日匯信大連帮稍有賣出、各號則結少數、綜之昨市尙稱穩固、而大條代日或有回低之勢、</p>
<h3>銀價續長匯兌平定</h3>
<p>昨據倫敦電訊、大條銀續見加長、脚地爲中國買進、小交易、市况平靜收盤後美國賣出之意、頗形活躍、市面堅穩、計近遠期均長零六二五、同爲十六便士八一二五、（合英金爲一先令七便士八七五）、又接紐約電訊、美銀價亦長三七五、爲三角六分一二五、英對美降去零三一二五、爲日元八角五分八一二五、美對英仍爲四元八角五分七八一二五、日美小去零六二五、爲四十九元五六二五、日英仍爲二先令零三二份之十七、英滬先令加上一二五、爲一先令七便士八七五、孟買無電、又本月上午十點五十分路透電到、計日美仍爲四十九元五六二五、日英仍計二先令三二份之十五、又九點三十分電通社來、亦無軒輊、計近期日美出入價仍爲四十九元五六二五至六二五、日英出入價仍計二先令零三二份之十五至三二份之十七　遠期日美出入價爲四十九元二七五至半、日英出入價計二先令零三二份之十三至四三七五、以後至午時來電亦無榮枯云、</p>
<h3>洋釐發生反印象</h3>
<p>▲銷胃不弱…市價反跌</p>
<p>▲市塲槪况　凡事難於逆料、此言誡然、查昨日洋厘市氣　觀其銷胃及場中交易類率較往時有增無减、且趨勢亦殊堅利、詎市價轉爾下游、究其理之由來、莫能解釋、都半謂供多求少所致、可見人情商情大都難於逆料者也、至於銀根之鬆、確爲銀行頭襯擁擠之故、然需要已不若從前之懈矣、</p>
<p>▲厘拆價格　（洋厘）早市爲七錢二分六厘七毫半、午市爲七錢二分六厘六毫二忽半、結果較前日早市竟爾一厘光景、雖屬循序遞减、而形勢不可謂不驟也、（銀拆）銀根又現鬆象、銀拆隨勢低賤、早市爲六分、午市亦無更動　銀行遂無掛牌而劃頭加水因之又弱、祗做二三分、甚有爲白劃者、</p>
<p>▲輔幣市情　江南小洋早市六錢四分八厘、午市爲六錢四分七厘、較前日午市似好一二厘、而交易有限、早市三千角、午市僅一千五百角、廣東小洋早市爲六錢三分七厘半、午市爲六錢三分六厘七毫半　較前日互易而同、做出交易早市十二萬角、午市七萬五千角、銅元賡續放長一千文、爲三百九十千文、交易三萬五千一百串、</p>
<p>▲銀洋進出　（銀欵）昨值星期三、銀行收解有限、華商收解票欵二百二十餘萬、外商收解票欵一百六七十萬、各種貨匯稅什諸欵收解七八百萬、出倉八十萬、日商銀行收解各欵二百八十餘萬、進倉四十萬、錢莊銀公單收解因值十五日之大比期、更兼長期到期之大批、收解故而甚多、計有五千餘萬、劃頭欵收解三百七十餘萬、各路匯欵一百二十餘萬、收現數十萬、（洋欵）匯劃票欵早市做出一百三十三萬五千、鈔票無交易、午市匯劃票欵做出八十一萬五千、鈔票一萬、場外交易鈔票早市十七萬四千、午市八萬五千、新幣早市五萬、午市無交易、銀行方面早市互市七十五萬、午市互市六十萬、各銀行洋户往來收解一百三十餘萬、鈔票收回及發生一百餘萬、客路杭州續來新幣二十四萬、長江及各埠集到五十餘萬、去胃北路裝三十餘萬、廣帮裝四十餘萬、内地花米欵十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解三百四十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百六十餘萬、拆借洋欵一百四十餘萬、小同行做出鈔票匯頭新幣等交易五六十萬、</p>
<h3>本届長期新消息</h3>
<p>銀錢業之今年上半年四月間、所放做之存欵長期、而應於本月份次第到期、查前次十日到期之欵、原有數百萬、旋值雙十節休業、致失調查、而昨日（十五日）則爲第二批到期、核數不下千萬以上、在平時市面安穩之際、照例轉賬或收回、各聽各便、毋如此届因商業前途、危機四伏操有金融權之銀錢業、爲防患未然計、不得不出自嚴格之審愼、卒致大批放欵長期、多數不肯照轉、若一律强欲收回、難免引起莫大險象、故昨日各欠户要求賡續者過半、據聞尙無結果、因而放欵息價　亦未正式宣佈、至於存欵方面、旣鑒於放欵如此困難、對存欵勢必漠視、多數亦願償還、將來調劑情形如何、吾人雖難逆料、要知目前金融業貿易之困難、爲不可掩之事實也、並聞寗波金融界、在滬放欵甚多、業正紛紛派員、預備下星期間次第來滬、辦理長期存放事宜、届時必有熱鬧市面耳、</p>
<h3>證劵債市有回高之勢</h3>
<p>▲趨勢穩定…成交寥落</p>
<p>昨公債現貨雖有多種開出、成交續清、僅計六千七百元、期市亦益清閒、計上午成交三百十餘萬、下午則祗二百六十餘萬元、合計五百八十一萬元、内裁兵二百十餘萬、一九關稅約一百四十萬、其他均益稀少、至各公債變動、整六善後九六等、前後市成交寥落、價始終無甚變動、關稅晨初即好數角、以後立定不動、餘各一九關稅一九捲烟及編遣裁兵等、在晨初立定不動、以後因大户未有售出、而零户頗有收進、價因盤旋略堅、但趨勢始終甚平和、結果一九關十一月漲九角半、編遣一九捲各漲六七角、惟裁兵現貨久無市、比上旬跌二元七角云、</p>

<h3>紗花標紗跌破五十兩關門</h3>
<p>▲現紗亦跌五錢至一兩</p>
<p>紗市在上月中旬發生劇烈之跌風、嗣以和平佳訊、形勢堅穩、回漲六七兩、蓋戰事漫延七閱月、紗銷停滯、致存底增加而達十三萬包以上、市况疲軟、今則統一可期、實銷有暢達之望、此巨量存底有逐漸消弭之可能、市况遂由疲弱之境而轉向進展之途、但海外市况一再告跌、實銷雖較熱閙、然仍非内地實際的需要、漲風爲之阻遏、而呈盤旋之局勢、徘徊於五十二三兩之間者兩旬、邇者現紗銷路仍無暢旺之象、而海外市况依然虚弱、紗市又復下落、蓋此次戰區漫延旣廣、時日又久、秋收無望、元氣損失殆盡、而無戰事之地、則匪禍遍地、農產物價格旣低、又難銷售、人民購買力薄弱、故時局雖已樂觀、各地交通漸見恢復、而實際的需要難望起色、秋銷旺盛時期似已告失望、人氣趨向悲觀也、因時局和平消息而現之漲風乃又告消滅矣、就目前狀况而言、市况的頽風似未可視爲終止、蓋穩定紗市最大之力量厥惟現銷、他若海外市場之趨勢與棉市之情形、莫不處於壓迫勢力之地位、今現銷難望暢達、而此巨量之存底將無由消弭矣、瞻觀前途、在最近的將來似難向穩定地位推進、而盤旋於低峯、以待現銷而進退也、</p>
<p>▲標紗慘跌　人標前市開盤、市氣極疲、以美棉微跌、形勢仍衰、散户羣衆賣出、各跌二·五·錢、二三盤市况大虚、賣户蜂擁而來、各月均跌進五十兩關内、場中且有某廠購買、然大勢所趨、難以支持也、各月均跌一兩三·四·五錢、午後聞實需不暢、市氣仍衰、近月又跌五·八·六錢、收盤時遠月信誠購進、又回漲、全日成交統計三萬一千四百五十包、查賣出德記二千包、天昌一千八百五十包、榮興一千六百包、利昌七百包、協生九百包、達記八百包、大昌成一千五百包、其餘三·七·百包、買進裕大一千二百五十包、公泰一千三百五十包、賡豐二千八百五十包、信誠二千八百五十包、益昶九百五十包、其餘四七百包、茲將人標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>風雨飄搖的棉市</h3>
<p>▲悲觀的前程　本季美棉收成據第三次政府估計爲一四、四八六○○包、此以天氣利於棉收、故迭次報告均見增加、如此後繼續有良好之天氣、四次政府估計或將稍稍增加而達一千四百五十萬包之收穫、總之本季棉收量已可認爲確定、而廻顧消費狀况殊爲悲觀、各國棉紡業據各方報告、莫不趨向頽敗、將來季末滾存數字有開空前未有的紀錄之虞、更以一般物價之不美滿、新低價迭現、政府當局雖設法救濟、仍未能挽此頽風、據紐約電訊十三日紐鄂倫斯之討論救濟棉市之會議、仍未能得積極的結果、僅勸告農民明年减少棉田與新棉勿亟求出售而已、但就一般物價而言、棉花的跌風比較和緩、蓋價格比較各產物爲高、如無特别的引力、似亦不易背一般物價而異趨也、印棉以生產順利、消費减退、亦復奄奄不振、國外的棉市暫時均難恢復國内新棉生產尙無整個的估計可爲依據、大約早棉收成較歉、晚棉尙屬良好、新棉以天氣採摘較遲、及内地交通有阻、上市尙少、但需要者以現貨商鑒本地歉收索價較昻、而外棉則一再貶價求售、定購殊多、據紗廠聯合會報告本年上、半年國内紗廠消費原棉雖均見增加、而美印棉之增加率爲百分之五九、而中棉僅百分之二十六、至廠存外棉增百分之七十四、華棉反見减少、更據海關報告本年截止印棉進口一百六十八萬擔、美棉六十三萬擔之巨、定貨尙不與焉、據聞日廠方面已有定至明年三月份者、昔者在八九月之間抛進新棉日有所聞、而本年寂然、可見廠商準備充足、更有人希望出口者、此亦難如願以償、蓋往年出口以日本爲大宗、近來漸見减少矣、况印美棉價格旣低品質又良、對於華棉進急難　其濃厚、故出口數字上不易增進、不過暫時内地商不注意於國際的狀態、關於國内棉產不良之觀念、尙擯折不動、暫時或不致有猛烈的變化、綜之目前棉市處於四面楚歌之境、穩定之市面在最近或最近的將來尙屬不可能也、</p>
<p>▲懈怠的漢標　漢標前開以美棉平疲、上漲無力、跌二·三錢、午後有一部份補空、稍漲五分至一錢、但現棉銷路頗清、全日成交統計七百擔、查賣出昌記四千六百擔、振大四千八百擔、愼昌四千三百擔、餘昶四千三百擔、利昌二千四百擔、賡豐一千六百擔、其他一千二·九·百擔、買進天隆四千二百擔、元德二千三百擔、恒德五千二百擔、茂記三千一百擔、恒益二千三百擔、其餘一千二三百擔、茲將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>美棉救濟會議</h3>
<p>▲並無積極的結果</p>
<p>紐約電、十三日紐鄂倫斯開會討論救濟棉市問題、出席農務局商部等當局及銀行界代表等、討論結果（一）棉市在生產費之下、考慮明年棉田之減少、並希望紡織商準備明年之原棉、（二）勸告農民從速的收穫、除應自已的需用出售外、暫緩出賣、並減少明年棉田之種植云云、</p>
<h3>糧食米市勢將續跌</h3>
<p>▲閘北　昨日各路到申米船三十餘號、市銷呆滯、新粳河存獨厚、人心最軟、高貨向津尙殷、價小兩角、開出十六元半、普通去路不化、須小三角左右、市極萎疲、薄稻銷場轉呆、買氣沉寂、行情定中帶軟、羊秈來貨趨殷、客路零銷一律觀望、價小兩三角、頂貨十二元半、杜尖情勢微萎、交而漸稀、大盤回小角半之譜、埠秈零拆尙活、價守原盤、客尖車到甚接、去路平淡、回跌兩角許、特頂貨開十元零五角、白元銷場亦滯、盤面亦小一兩角、總觀全白市勢恐再有一落千丈之槪、實緣日本運米到滬、市氣一律不振也、</p>
<p>▲滬南　河到二十餘號、本街走銷極淡、常帮新粳因此開貨稀、故已告定、特頂貨開十六元四五角、而蘇同帮粳亦鮮榮辱　情勢平平、南帮各窰種白稻等去化一律清淡、價格微小近角　羊秈杜尖市亦平定、</p>
<h3>標粉市大瀉特瀉</h3>
<p>▲純受外市的打擊</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、均一致暴跌　尤以本月份爲更甚、至此種跌勢之由來、仍爲國外所牽動、聞滿洲麥初傳四兩七錢半已可訂購、昨則盛傳四兩五錢半之電訊、已得覆電、并傳某大廠已有訂定、至本月份跌勢更狂聞係前月份之棧單、多頭已經回出、本月份當仍行向交易所交出、因此近遠期之人心、大見搖動、大廠家之抛售、亦極暢旺、全日成交額達一百五十萬包、市况則均在銳落之中、後步如國外消息、依然不佳、恐尙有問題也、結果本月份跌五分半之巨、十一月份跌四分二厘半、十二月份跌四分、正月份跌四分二厘半、二月份跌四分半、三月份跌四分云、</p>
<h3>麥市下降力大强</h3>
<p>▲暴落的粉市…廉宜的外麥</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午初盤時、因洋麥報佳曾好三四角、故人心頗見穩定、迨後因粉市不振、人心見疲、及至下午開盤、因粉市之暴落、及國外現麥之送盤、虚弱之人心、亦爲震動、一時抛户甚盛、市價亦仆落不已、遠期各月份、均與新麥時期、不相上下、跌勢之狂、可見一斑、結果本月份跌一錢、十一十二月份跌七分、一月份跌五分、二月份跌四分、三月份跌三分、現麥因廠家一致擯住、乃只包未開云、</p>

<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍無轉機、查海外各絲織廠以銷費日减、存絲尙厚、足敷需求、加以日絲充斥、華絲仍鮮進胃、昨祗信孚進滬白廠經十包、泰和等進白乾經十五包、價均堅定云、</p>
<h3>絲廠長吐生產日减</h3>
<p>▲法銷稍起：價漲二三兩</p>

<h3>俄莊開辦遂安珍眉</h3>
<p>本埠洋莊茶市、自新茶上市以來、遂安歙縣等路之中莊珍眉、銷路始終疲滯、致茶價步跌至四五十兩、華茶所受虧折、每擔不下六十兩、昨市俄莊協助會鑒於遂安珍眉茶價相宜、業已進行開辦、英行亦多聞風收買、珍眉市面、或有活動之勢、惟俄莊銷胃雖極廣大、而認價獨見綦苛、一日來祁眉紅茶及貢熙綠茶談判雖多、卒因該行索價過鉅、交易依然寥落云、</p>

<h3>五金　東鐵昨有大批到貨</h3>
<p>東白鐵近來到貨甚少、致各帮購辦者特多、市貨有不繼之勢、故標準節節上升、刻計三七尺售一兩一錢三分、三六尺九錢一分半、昨聞浦東大阪棧及三菱公司滙山棧等、共有到貨一萬餘張、正在報關、市貨不至有斷檔之憂也、</p>

<h3>前鋒周報</h3>
<p>— 湯彬</p>
<p>第十六期</p>
<p>「前鋒周報」自出版以來、突破了紊亂不堪的中國文藝界當前的危機、它是民族主義文藝的一枝生力軍、僅爲了這樣一種渺小的文藝刋物、而影響到全國的文藝界、思想界、實際、該報的體積雖小、但是内容實有超過國内刋行著一般所謂大雜誌之上、關於此、我們祗須考察已出版的十餘期「前鋒」、便能瞭然無遺、它旣有長篇的民族主義文藝的理論、檢討中國新舊文藝界的批判巨著、尖峭深刻的談鋒、眞摯有力的創作、雄放激昻的詩歌、又有長篇的具有豐富民族意識的翻譯小說、以文藝的立塲來說、這周刋實是國内異軍突起的一種羅、包萬象的紙文藝刋物、同時、也是發揚民族主義文藝的一枝主力軍、目前文藝界的一朶奇花、</p>
<p>這期「前鋒」、内載四篇文章、除爭波譯的「兩個月孤兒」是長篇的續稿外、其餘三篇均是短小精悍的力作、在國内其它没有中心思想的大小刋物上實不易多見、這眞個值得我們意外的驚善、</p>
<p>張季平的「民族主義文藝的題材問題」、是一篇具體的短論、它對於創製民族主義文藝的創作實有莫大的關碍、誰也曉得、「題材」問題之創作上最重要的一個問題、在民族主義文藝運動由底定了理論基礎而注視於創作的現在、這問題是應該積極地提出來討論、</p>
<p>李翼之的「民衆」、亦是一篇熟練的創作、作者是以第一人稱來描寫自己到上海來半年的生活、秋風所引起的鄉愁、妻子的耐勞、表現中華民族的女子特具的個性、舊友希武君從江西跑到上海所報告該地被土匪擾亂的實情、民衆勾結土匪的起因、關於此、更有詳細的感人的刻畫、以這樣雜的事實、表現着一篇具有民族主義文藝中心的創作、緊凑而熟練、處處都顯露着作者藝術手腕所獨到之長、描寫「靖衛隊管」的喫了敗杖一段對話、及其它、是全文最著重的點眼、現徵引於下、</p>
<p>「他們的隊伍原是分散的、一個分隊駐紮在離匪巢不遠的村莊裏、他們一到這村莊、便把村中的豬羊鷄鴨全殺光了、大酒大肉、大賭起來、晚上自己不願放哨、便從床上拖農民起來、代替、自己便姦淫農民的妻女、這樣的幹實比土匪厲害得多、」</p>
<p>「原來駐紮這村莊上的靖衛隊、是全數被殺了、農民已經勾結了土匪、準備大舉攻城了、」</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>「帝國主義者、兵災·匪禍·貪污·土劣·一重重的苦難加在我們民衆身上、我們民衆將會無路可走了、」</p>
<p>像作者上面這些所爲、實是民族主義文藝最值得採用的創作題材、而且内地民衆一般的現象、更須使「以上海爲安樂窩」的民衆有明白之必要、即在技巧上、這篇「民衆」亦是熟練的而達到圓活地步的佳精、是一篇不易多見的創作、</p>
<p>查義的「自由與割碎頭皮」一文、是一篇尖峭動人的談鋒、給予「情願不自由、就是自由了」與思想家的前衛」的等等所謂大作家們當頭一棒、是很有意義作品、讀者也不該忽視、</p>
<h3>書報介紹稿例</h3>

<h3>草野周刋</h3>
<p>— 南心</p>
<p>三卷十號</p>
<p>國内唯一的純文藝刋物「草野」、它底内容是具有民族主義的中心意識、每一期雖然是小小的一張、但是其中所刋載的文章、無論詩歌、散文與創作均值得一讀、深深地打動我們讀者的心坎、這顯然是民族主義文藝所特具的一種力量、誰也不能否認、最近出版的第三卷十號、在内容上是有特異的進展、每一篇文章都顯現着精采的所在、這當然也可以說是民族主義文藝運動的過程中一種必然的現象、不過它在藝術上的突進實較諸其它的文藝思潮爲速、僅以這一點、可以顯明地窺出民族主義文藝底偉大、進一步說、民族主義文藝的突進已成爲擺在我們讀者眼前的事實、</p>
<p>這期草野共包涵六篇文章、（一）鄒枋的黃昏細雨曲、（二）陶義升的馬克思主義者活把戲、（三）吳希玲的女詩人散記、（四）湯增敭的沙塲鐵血（二）、（五）黃奐若的悲壯一杯、（六）文壇短訊十則、現在槪括地介紹於下、以共同好、</p>
<p>「黃昏細雨曲」是作者描寫自己生活片斷的一首長篇的散文詩、這期僅自第一曲刋載到第七曲、但是在這短短的數曲之中、已很可以看出作者取得了向上的意識、及向民族主義文藝這方面來努力的一顆心、在第二曲裏、曾有這樣的揮寫、「雖然、這是件說不出快心的勇武的事呀、當比我更利精的槍砲横棄在郊野、具着劊子手的酷暴的敵入、至今奄奄屈服了、我的刺刀已戳穿他們底胸腔、從窟窿裏滂礴着急殷紅的血瀑、……又莊嚴、又赳赳、我們底幾聲驚破了黃昏、我們的歌喊要使宇宙震撼、」由此、可以知道作者對殘害中華民族的敵人是多麽的怨恨、表現中華民族的毅勇、具有果敢的精神、在以後的數曲中、我敢深信作者所表現的更爲獨到而有力、</p>
<p>「馬克思主義者活把戲」一文、是很值得我們重視的一篇批判文字、作者採用極其簡老的藝術手腕、將所謂普羅作家的内幕赤裸地暴露無餘、尤其對於翻譯蘇俄共產黨宣言的人、盡其量的指摘、但在作者陶君是完全根據着一般人所公認的事實、眞如草野周刋的記者在篇前所說「有目共睹、毋庸考證」的了、</p>
<p>這種尖銳的批評文字、尤其是暴露所謂普羅作家暗幕與陰謀者、在民族主義文藝運動統一文藝界的思想的現今、是非常地需要它底運生、草野周刋現闢此欄、專刋此項文章、實值我們讀者的重視、即如陶君此文、讀者也不該輕輕把它看了過去、</p>

<p>青年園地</p>
<h3>近狀</h3>
<p>— 鼎</p>
<p>嘉、</p>
<p>上星期吾給你的信、在申報「青年園地」發表後、引起了全校同學的注意、壁報「短波無線電」上、在星期一早晨、就把全篇剪下、公佈出來、還加上了些半開頑笑的按語、又特别代吾登了個專電、說什麽鼎女士近日因功課太忙、日裏没有時間寫信、大意是如此、吾忘記把它抄下了、嘉、這種話吾看到了、眞使吾有些生氣、近來吾想約幾個同學、也來辦張壁報、盡量把男同學向吾們表演的　事、宣布出來、你的意見怎樣、贊成嗎、</p>
<p>上次吾不是已告訴過你、在壁報「曦聲」上登載了篇「父與子」、訴說普羅Ｘ同志用了殘酷無人心的方法、離間青年對他父親脫離關係、這事雖歸訓育處辦理、可是現在却無形停頓了、最近又出了張壁報、呌「返晨」、在這裏邊、吾們看到一件很可注意的事、内容序述一個姓萬的學生、引誘純潔的少女、把家裏的妻子抛了不顧、同家庭也閙到破裂、這種滑浮無人格的學生、當局非但不懲戒他、糾正他、反因爲父親停止供給他一切用費、學膳等費、由Ｘ同志把領到的盧布津貼他、使他入學、據說這Ｘ同志能有今日的地位、他的功勞很大、同時要他在校裏帮忙、把自己的地位、造成「水門汀」樣的堅固、嘉、你看這種人辦敎育、訓導青年、怎樣能把學校辦好、吾眞不知道、這班敎職員、爲什麽這樣隱忍、把自已的名譽、都污濁在一起、</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>你又要說吾大發議論了吧、可是這種事實、太使吾生氣了、神聖的敎育界、有這種敗類混在裏邊、不得不使吾發幾句牢騷、你看了覺得討厭嗎、停止了、不再多說、現在講件有趣的事實給你聽、上學期這裏不是還有個蓬鬆着頭髮、穿了件大布長袍、拿了個破皮包的辭學敎授嗎、看他的樣子是很樸素老實、道高望重的人、近來却被同學們呌他「登徒子」了、原因也同他的高足姓萬的一樣、把原籍的妻子、抛了不要、在日本玩下女、回國後、做被封了的某大學代理校長時、同了個清黨時逃到日本去的某女士、發生關係、最近却在杭州、與他同居了年餘的文學士某女士舉行結婚典禮、這事你一定要說吾聽謠傳、决非事實吧、嘉、可是這位敎授已承認了、在雙十節這天、他請了許多人在大旅社吃喜酒、並且聽說還收賀禮呢、</p>
<p>這幾天校裏謠傳很多、說什麽中學部主任因事已有一星期多不到校、貼了個佈告、請秘書代理、秘書也不能來校、又請了個代理敎員代辦一切、這樣引起了很多同學不滿、敎職員也都覺得這樣是不對的、有位做律師的英文敎員、很滑稽的說、「這個學校、變成一個家庭一樣、父親有事、可呌母親管理家務、母親有事、又可呌兒子代理、這個比喻眞妙得很、不知那個代理人、知道了没有、吾想他一定很生氣、把他當作人家的兒子、</p>
<p>吾將在說過不講這種事、現在又說了、對不起得很、現在决定不說了、告訴你件要緊事吧、校裏十五日起、要開紀念會、接連着三天、你有功夫來嗎、吾等着你、所謂東宫的吾們宿舍、那時也要開放、你可以到吾的房間來玩、預備着許多你歡喜吃的糖果等你、答應吾、你一定來、否則吾要生氣了、附帶的告訴你、替你做好了件新絨綫衫、那天你來了給你、</p>
<p>再見吧、願你今晚夢見吾給你個熱烈的擁抱、　　鼎、於江灣、</p>

<h3>大學生的苦悶</h3>
<p>— 明厂</p>
<p>記得曾在什麽照上看見有人這樣寫過、說大學生活是一首詩、又頌揚大學生活如何美麗詩、和美麗的生活、我是做學也没有抓住過、我總覺得這種生活旣不是詩更夠不上說是美麗、就我所感覺得的、祗好說這種生活是在苦悶中掙扎着、</p>
<p>理由、當然是有的、</p>
<p>當你第一天跨進大學校門的時候、最使你感覺得痛苦的、也許就是選課和註册了、憑了你的學費收據給你一張註册證、有時也許會附給你一份註册須知、逐日課程表、於是他們的責任便算完了、至於你配進什麽系、配選什麽課程、那完全是你自已的事、是用不着指導的、也許你可以從志同學面前得一些零碎、無系統的知識、但大部份你是要像瞎子摸墻一樣底將課程選好、</p>
<p>選好了以後怎樣呢、當然送給院長或主任先生簽字了、於是在人叢中掙扎着、爭先恐後的擁擠得同在影戲院門口一樣、院長呢、拿着你的註册證推敲着、爭論着學分讀多讀少、像小菜塲上講斤兩價錢一樣、但是他可以不問你的個性、你的程度、你的志趣、歷史、希望、……隨意增加塗改的、但是他不能不隨意的、你該原諄他、這樣多的人在等待他一個個做這種瑣細麻煩的事呢、</p>
<p>於是你便有上課的權利了、談起上課你就可以想到你該讀各種各樣的書、和聽各種各樣的敎授的講授、他們都毫不一致的敎着、各人敎各人的東西、正像從大百貨公司各櫃上買來的種種貨物一樣、你便一包一包各不相關的㩙進你的皮包中去、這些東西永遠是各自爲各的捆着、至于敎授呢、下了課、便各人走各人的路、</p>
<p>敎授天生就是一種忙的事業、一下課、看他們匆匆忙忙趕車子的樣子、便可知道了、這是不能怪的、因爲他們還得趕上别的大學的上課時間、但是學生呢、有疑問祇好待上課時解决、有時敎授也在鼓勵學生問問題、但是一點鐘究竟祗有六十分鐘、要被支配作講授、復習、查考、以及加上問題和討論之用、如果是可能的話、我們得將鐘向標準重行改造才行、因問題討論而荒了正課、又覺得課程内容欠允實、因忙着趕正課而不提出問題、學生有時又不了解、這個問題、在忙的敎授們是永遠解决不了的、而學生呢大約在不充實與不了解兩者中都身受其惠的、談到演講、你就可以想到站在講台上的敎授和留聲機一樣底不斷放出聲音來、抑揚高低的傳到學生耳鼓裏、於是學生專心聽、筆記着、正和一架活動的打字機一樣、敎授講完了算是盡了他的義務、學生記上了簿子算是了去他的責任、完全是如此被動的機械的做下去、</p>
<p>學生呢、究竟是大學生、决不是甘心自暴自棄的、他很希望在聽演講、筆記之外、還能研究一些有意義的工作、討論一些有意義的問題、關於他所讀的功課、可是當他看到自己的課程表時、他不能不失去他的勇氣、他每星期有廿多點鐘課要上、他有許多必修的課程和不相平而不可不讀的東西、不是這樣刻板的做去他不能畢業、他不得分散了他的精神、去應付普通而平凡的課程、於是他不得不將熱心而切望要解决的問題或研究的東西擱在一邊、即便他有勇氣去研究的話、在校無指導的負責者、他不能每天晚上坐車子大遠路去看所要看的敎授、請他指導和討論、即使可以的話、一天苦工的敎授、會不討厭他嗎、而且他不但明天有課要上、也許有别的功課要預備、而且晚上出校、在學校方面也不方便的、可是這種渴望盹要求、衝動、永遠繞着他而不得解决使苦他在悶中掙扎着、</p>
<p>熱心的敎授正在用盡心力來鼓勵他的學生、他告訴他們研究的方法、探討的途徑、他指許多參考書要他們去讀、做筆記報告、他明知一個學生一星期要上二十多點鐘課、他也明知一個學生一星期要趕十門或近十門的功課、他也明知圖書館每種參考書祗有一本、他也明知課室内有二十或三十人而書是不夠輪流支配、然而他也許會要他們在三兩天中交卷、或查問的、學生呢、終究不是甘心自抛自棄的、可是他不必定就可以着得看參考書、因爲書祗有一本呀、於是他徘徊着想出了不正當的解决的方法、雖然不是他所願意做的、</p>
<p>天下最殘忍的事、莫過於給一個飢餓的小動物、看得着嗅得着而吃不到的可口香美的食物了、大學敎育裏面、也有這一回事、熱心的敎授們拉出知識的一個半面或一角出來煊耀於學生面前、而提高了他們的知識慾、却又不給他以正當滿足的方法、一下課便不負責任的走了、於是没有毅力的學生因爲自己解决不了而反入於自暴自棄、有毅力的在黑暗中自己摸索着、也許有時拉到一塊不能當食物的東西在大嚼、他們是缺乏指導的知識飢荒的青年、而敎授是没有時間去指導、學校不注意這種設施、結果是學生祗有在這種苦悶的生活之下、掙扎度過他四年的生活、</p>
<p>十九、九、二十、于光華、</p>
<h3>國慶日童軍檢閱</h3>
<p>— （冰攝）</p>
<h3>交大體育近况</h3>
<p>— 小魯</p>
<p>交通大學的體育本來是很有名的、並且設備也完全比滬上各大學都好、自從足球輸了曁南兩次、和游泳屈居第二後、喪色了不少、所以該校當局極力特倡、並且該校又是念工程的學校、對於學生身體問題更要特别注意、</p>
<p>本學期該校新聘了申國權爲體育館主任、申主任從前也是由該校畢業、他對於運動非常有研究、素負有「南洋君」的美號、並且以後還到美國專攻體育得了學士學位、申主任到任不過一個多月、但是所做出的成積很多、記者略舉其重要之一二列於下面、</p>
<p>（一）游泳池放熱水　上海各大學的游泳池可算是該校最好了、這次江大游泳錦標比賽也是在那邊舉行、並且該校同學個個都歡喜游泳、暑假的時候差不多每天都把游泳池擠滿、到了現在因爲天氣太冷很多的不敢下水、所以該校放了熱水進去、以便同學們練習、</p>
<p>（二）聘請三校友爲指導員　該校於上學期畢業去運動健將很多、如陳璞、陳虞添、安原生等、這三位對於各項運動都會、尤是的足球、該校現以騁來爲體育指導員、</p>
<p>（三）舉行球類比賽　連日該校舉行球類比賽、如和美童公學比網球、和震旦高麗隊比足球等、同時又舉行級際和個人錦標比賽、成積都很好云、</p>
<h3>國慶紀念節馬路巡閱</h3>
<p>— 冠翰</p>
<p>一年一度、望眼將穿舉國歡騰的國慶紀念節、十月十日又蒞臨了、慶祝之熱列、却出乎往歲的紀錄、這個民氣的表現、給予我們多少的認識、然而、這空前的狀况、讓他平庸底過去、未免可惜吧、所以、任慶祝國慶籌備委員會怎樣底計劃、如其缺少了馬路巡閱使的人選、終究是憾事的、</p>
<p>「馬路巡閱使」、似乎是個官銜、事實却相反、不涉政治的、鄙人欲當斯職幾次、結果總不能達到目的、這回、武斷底自任起來、縱然受着些勞苦、但所得的見聞、雋趣無比、爲欲使閱者們間接底也做一回巡閱使、特將榮任經過、公開底申說一下罷、</p>
<p>先要聲明、鄙人僑居在閘北、所以巡閱使的職務、僅及於南從界路北至天通庵車站、東自沿北四川路以迄寳山路爲止、</p>
<p>九日晨、因職責攸關、早食用過、便向各馬路巡行、先注意排樓的形式、以北站兩路同人工會所建者至佳、全用花葉扎成、莊嚴生氣、其次、寳山路中段商務印書館工會所辦的亦佳、樓門有三、大書「民族」「民權」「民生」分佈於門楣上、所以表示三民主義之意、慶祝國慶、復導人認識總理的遺訓、法至上乘、界路口的排樓、用彩帛造成、惜顏色不鮮、　且頂端綴以龍首之圖案、陳腐益彰、倒不及天通庵站所築的、雖單簡而紙製、但鮮艶奪目、在在娱人、北四川路之虬江路口、年有排樓建築、不知如何、這次却付缺如、减色不少、有某商店、在寳山路近寳興路、門口建一排樓、本來是開張大减價的號召裝飾、店東先生、却會投機、大書「恭祝國慶」四字掛在中央、這樣一來、誰見了不嘉奬他的偉大愛國心呢、</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>「朋友、明早跑去大世界裏廂看肇芳會唱、阿好、」</p>
<p>「蠻好、一道去、」</p>
<p>「小五子、倷格哈呵有啥格白相、」</p>
<p>「拍五百車麻雀、剷伊爾剷……」</p>
<p>「嘸啥、實梗語吧、」</p>
<p>蹀　寳山路一小段、民間複雜的歡娱計劃、接續底送進耳官内部來、一會兒、轉入新廣東街、這街名、不必宣述内幕、見名知義也曉得的了、沿路市房、多是粤人居住、刹那間、又聽到了問答的句話、</p>
<p>「亞勝、今晚你嘅學堂有　野睇呀、」</p>
<p>「好多嘅、京戲、白話戲、最後重有廣公童子軍音樂隊演奏添、」</p>
<p>「你又話去睇提燈會、」</p>
<p>「而家不過四點五個字、六點鐘咱出發、黑哋都唔遲、駛乜咁早去呢、」</p>
<p>「…………………………」</p>
<p>「…………………………」</p>
<p>不論在那處、聽覺總不稍息底感到老幼粗細的聲音、是歡娱的語調、尤其是句句和雙十節相關、於此、可知民衆對於國慶節的認識到現在已是充分底注意了、</p>
<p>差一刻到六點、提燈會將舉行了我、想會裏必有許多材料、因此、又立刻巡出了、寳山路上、國旗招展之下、人聲鼎沸、果然熱閙非常、熙來攘往、摩肩擦背、萬人爭看提燈、在輝煙燦爛的排樓下、一叢叢的人辟、個個歡容滿面、翹首瞻仰嵌在彩架上的總理遺像、</p>
<p>「來哉、來哉、」</p>
<p>一聲高呌、衆目交接、原來是某團體自北站來而赴會的小隊伍、不久、又是同樣底呌着、鄙人也盲從着去注意、竟上了好幾次的當、</p>
<p>「來哉、來哉、眞的來哉、」</p>
<p>人聲擾嚷的當兒、果然是眞的來了、樂聲自遠處漸漸播來、頓破觀衆的岑寂、未幾、一行行的隊伍、五光十色的燈籠、音調喧天的鼓樂、目不暇睫、震耳欲聾、光怪陸離、煞是好看、鄙人爲欲看個人更親切、數次鼓着勇氣擠入人羣當中、可是、風浪般洶湧着的人們、你推我拒、終究把鄙人驅出重圍、没法兒、祇得站在路邊水門汗上、幸而仍可看見、不致辜負了這一回蒞臨、</p>
<p>提燈會裏面、第二段救火會的車上、有兩位先生、戴着假面具、舉動很滑稽、引得看客個個捧起腹來、</p>
<p>通俗宣講團化裝飾的蔡公時烈士遇難、表演甚佳、可惜在這民心歡騰的當兒、重提這悲慘的印像、未免掃興得很、</p>
<p>「嚌鼕嘭、嚌鼕嘭、嚌鼕嚌鼕嘭、」</p>
<p>一陣鑼鼓響、把觀衆視線引誘過去、我望了一望、却使我不悅得很、原來是某校學生的音樂隊、學校的音樂、竟陳腐若此、不免有失體統了、</p>
<p>童子軍隊中、以廣肇公學爲最佳、全隊精神飽滿、服裝整潔、步武有條不紊、且備有音樂隊、聲韻鏗鏘、非同凡品、「此曲祗應天上有」、廣公樂隊可以當之無愧了、聞該隊之得有此種成績、實得力於該校校長盧頌虔之贊助、敎授張訓芳黎潮舒張亦庵諸先生之苦心訓練所致云、</p>
<p>飄揚半空的無限旗幟之中、以洋服職工會之會旗爲最美、質以綢製、色復鮮明、艶麗無比、</p>
<p>最滑稽的、有某公司竟趁着國慶紀念慶祝提燈會裏、作絶妙的廣告宣傳、把他們的出品、一樣樣底紮成燈籠、也照例點上燭光、而那最普通的「恭祝國慶」字句、却尋遍了也没有、這種等於游行廣告的宣傳品、似乎不應滲雜在這個偉大的慶祝會裏出現、難免令人猜疑有辱這次大會的行爲、現在、往事休提了、深望來年不再發覺這種毫無意識的錯誤、</p>
<p>隊伍中有龍三條、醒獅一、各個舞者都能將歡娱的心情灌注到物質上去、於是、舞的姿態、很是美觀、博得觀衆的同情不少、</p>
<p>「完結、完結、」</p>
<p>「嘸畢哉、」</p>
<p>一陣喧嚷。錢塘潮般的觀衆、怒號底向南面湧來、鄙人也站立不住、祇命令四肢總退却、當轉入横路時、隱約還聽到軍樂隊的笛聲、這大槪就是殿軍的武裝同志了、</p>

<h3>Situation in Guangxi Becomes Tense Again</h3>
<p>Fierce fighting between Binyang and Nanning. Zhang and Gui troops retreat to Nama and Qianjiang.</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Peace in Guangxi may be difficult to achieve, as only Huang Shaoxiong is advocating for peace on the Guangxi side. Zhang Fakui, Li Zongren, and Bai Chongxi remain strong in their stance. Fearing that Chiang and Cai's troops would return to attack Guangxi, as a preemptive measure, they suddenly transferred 5,000 troops from Liu, including Huang Heling, Mo Shujie, Wu Qiwei, and others, to Binyang and Shanglin on the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 13th, to attack Yu's division and the Yunnan Army's Lu Han division.

<p>(Fuzhou) Lu Xingming, returning to Yan from Shanghai via Zhejiang, was intercepted in Jiangshan County by He Wang's local militia unit, newly appointed by Zhang's division. The provincial government has ordered that he be escorted to the province immediately. Previous news of Lu Xingrong's detention was a false rumor. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The Tinglong Save-the-Homeland Association telegraphed the province, stating that Lu's troops were about to join the communists, and requesting that Western Fujian be included in the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi anti-communist zone.

<p>(Fuzhou) Fujian natives in Beijing telegraphed the provincial government, requesting an order for the Lu-suppression army to advance. The Eastern Route Army has reached Wangding Shangkeng. (15th)</p>

The 18th Division's Zhang Huizan unit met them in battle, killing over a thousand bandits and seizing many firearms. They are now ordering troops to pursue and attempt to join the Fourth Route Army for a combined attack. Lu Diping, due to the communist's intent to flee from Eastern Jiangxi to Fujian, dispatched the Ninth Route Army's troops to station in Fuzhou for interception. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>The Story of Wang Jingwei Leaving the Country</h3>

<h3>Feng's Troops Contacting for Surrender</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A meeting of Feng's officers in Jiaozuo Matunzhen decided to temporarily ignore the Northwest Army on the south bank, and to find ways to contact the units retreating west of Luoyang.

They plan to form four armies in the various counties of Huaiqing Prefecture. One party has sent Shu Shuangquan to Nanjing to contact the Central Government for surrender.

<p>(Beiping) Feng has arrived in Zezhou, and his troops are gradually shifting from the eight counties of Huaiqing towards Shanxi. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Arrived in Tianjin Yesterday</h3>
<p>Representing the Central Government to Witness Wang's Oath</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Wu Tiecheng and Zhao Ti arrived in Tianjin on the morning of the 15th. Wu told reporters that he was representing the Central Government to witness Wang Shuchang and Yu Xuezhong's oath-taking. After the ceremony, he will return to Shenyang and return to Nanjing at the end of the month to attend the Fourth Plenary Session. The Central Government has decided to eliminate reactionaries and thoroughly reorganize party affairs in North China. Yan must be held responsible for the years of war. Hebei Province has suffered deeply from military and political oppression, and I am truly glad that the Northeast has sent troops to relieve this oppression for the people of Hebei Province. Anyone who undermines unity and peace is bound to fail. The results of this war can serve as proof. With Yan and Feng's retirement, China no longer has warlords, and true unification and lasting peace will be achieved from now on. The Central Government will treat all generals under Yan and Feng equally and will never punish them. However, if Yan and Feng do not thoroughly repent, the Central Government will have no choice but to suppress them. Zhang Xueliang supports the sole Central Government and is committed to peace, but if peace cannot be achieved, he will use other methods to resolve the situation. Zhang is fully responsible for military affairs in the North. What is needed now is a unified government. Only with a unified government can there be peace, and only after peace can administrative affairs return to order. The Northeast Army's entry into the customs and the takeover of Central and Tianjin institutions by the Northeast are by order of the Central Government. After the military operations are concluded, they will be returned to the Central Government. The reorganizationists are disrupting things by relying on warlords, and now they have lost their backing. If they can repent, the Central Government will be able to forgive them, but otherwise, they will not be forgiven. Zhao told reporters that Zhang attaches great importance to Wang and Yu taking office and sent me as a representative to attend the swearing-in ceremony and deliver a speech. Yan has always been prudent and steady in his work, and there may be hidden reasons for his use of force this time. Feng is exceptionally astute and excels at training troops. Both are now at a dead end, and if they do not leave, the consequences may be dire. Zhang does not change his advocacy of peace, but if peace cannot be achieved, now that he is Deputy Commander, he can only obey the orders of the Central Government. The Northeast Third and Fourth Armies are preparing, and if necessary, they will mobilize and enter the customs. Shi Yousan is from Jilin and has a long history with the Northeast. There is no doubt that he will cooperate with Zhang. At 1:00 PM, Wu and Zhao visited Wang Shuchang and decided on the swearing-in ceremony for 10:00 AM on the 17th. The Municipal Party Headquarters has scheduled a welcome meeting for the representatives of various organizations at 3:00 PM on the 16th and has invited Wu to speak. Wu and Zhao are scheduled to go to Beiping early on the 18th. Two trains carrying the provincial government's furniture and files left for Tianjin on the morning of the 15th. Two trains carrying the Department of Civil Affairs' furniture and files will arrive in Tianjin on the morning of the 16th. Other departments will follow. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Wu Tiecheng arrived in Tianjin today and has scheduled the swearing-in ceremony for Wang Shuchang for the 20th. He will come to Beiping on the 22nd. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Wu Tiecheng left for Tianjin this morning, first to witness Wang Shuchang's inauguration and then to go to Beiping to witness Yu Xuezhong's inauguration. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Advocates Abolishing Special Taxes in Beiping and Tianjin</h3>
<p>(Beijing) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Yu Xuezhong, Wang Shuchang, and the acting mayors of Beiping and Tianjin, Zang Wang, on the 14th, saying that the special donations in Tianjin are harmful to merchants and the people and should be stopped. The special donations temporarily increased by the Jin side in the Beiping and Tianjin area should be abolished altogether. He requests that they be jointly investigated, comprehensively planned, and telegraphed back in detail so that they can be reviewed and implemented. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Central University Student Proposal</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Central University students Tu Juyao and over 290 others proposed to the university: (1) The Secretary-General is deceiving the President and should be dismissed immediately. (2) The Secretariat has too much power and should be abolished immediately. (3) The school's administrative expenses should be reduced. (4) The expenses of each college should be independent. (5) The school's finances should be genuinely transparent. (6) More full-time professors should be hired, and tuition and lecture fees should be waived. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Hongfen, Dean of the College of Science at Central University, has resigned and will not take office. Liu Shuqi has now been hired as his successor. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministry Protests Longjing Village Incident</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the incident caused by Japanese police in Longjing Village, Yanji, the Foreign Ministry, based on Zhang Xueliang's report, has lodged a serious protest with Shigemitsu Aoi. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Diplomatic Association telegraphed the whole country, revealing the truth about the Longjing Village incident in Yanbian, urging everyone to rise up together to fight for national survival and seek international equality. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Recent News on Sino-Russian Conference</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Ministry news: Whether negotiations will continue after the opening of the Sino-Soviet Conference, Mo Dehui has yet to report. The previous plan to add four special commissioners has also been temporarily suspended. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that when Russia provoked China last year, the postal offices on the borders of the Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces suffered heavy losses. They have specially prepared an investigation form and consulted the Foreign Ministry, ordering the local resident to investigate the commercial situation of overseas Chinese. The Foreign Ministry has instructed Zhong Yu, the commissioner of foreign affairs in Harbin, to negotiate with Russia and demand compensation. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>A Boon for the Airship Construction Industry</h3>
<p>Whatever happens in the world, a single sacrifice will certainly bring a good result, and a single failure will certainly bring a lesson. Therefore, it is said that failure is the mother of success. The invention of machines in the world has reached today, and it is unknown how many sacrifices and failures have been made. Following the predecessors and working hard, they have been able to become more and more refined, from danger to safety, from simple to perfect. Tracing back to the origin, none of it is not due to the sacrifices and failures of the predecessors. The accident of the British airship R101 is not only a great sacrifice in terms of material things, but also a great sacrifice in the academic and intellectual circles, and a great sacrifice of specialized talents. It is truly regrettable that the United Kingdom has unfortunately encountered such a significant loss. However, because of this loss, we can further study the cause of the disaster, and know that it is unreliable to rely on light and flammable gases. And further research what to replace it with. Only helium is known to be non-flammable. But it is also monopolized by the United States. Estonia has now discovered a huge amount of helium, enough to supply the airship construction industry in Britain and Germany. If its statement is true, it is truly a great contribution to the world. Although Britain has made this great sacrifice, there are many things that can be preserved for the future world because of this sacrifice. Is it not true that failure is the mother of success?</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that there is no progress in science in our country, and no invention in machine manufacturing. However, at this time of world invention and success, we can follow and imitate it, and it is not difficult to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Now, if we want to establish a country in the world and start a career of all kinds of construction, where else can we go without this struggle and effort?</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>Disaster Situation in Lanfeng Is Extremely Serious</h3>
<p>Suixian and Minquan Are in Dire Need of Revitalization</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) The Lan area has been the scene of fighting for the longest time, and the disaster situation is extremely serious. The Henan Provincial Government has sent commissioners to Lan to investigate. The total length of trenches in the entire territory is over 720,000 feet. The people need over 22,000 yuan to fill it. We will use work as a way to provide revitalization, and engage in land filling. As for the people who have fled, only five-tenths have returned to their homes. Livestock losses have left most farmers without the means to cultivate the land, and food is extremely scarce. When the press corps inspected the countryside, they personally saw farmers eating red grain cornbread and red grain thin porridge. When asked, they said that there are no sellers of wheat flour here. The disaster situation can be seen. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Duan Jianmin, a special commissioner of the Central Organization Department, is inspecting the disaster situation in the war zone. He has telegraphed that the disaster situation in Suixian, Minquan and other counties is extremely serious and urgently needs revitalization. The central government has transferred the matter to the National Government, ordering the Executive Yuan to instruct its subordinates to handle the matter as soon as possible. The Ministry of Interior and Ministry of National Defense are now jointly discussing relief measures with the Relief Committee. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu Plans to Tour Beiping and Tianjin</h3>

(Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>National Government Issues Instructions to Retain Zhang Fang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government previously received a telegram on the 11th from Zhang Fang, the acting chairman of the Henan Provincial Government and commander-in-chief of the 20th Route of the Anti-Rebellion Army, requesting permission to resign and retire to his hometown after the military situation ended. The National Government stated that the commissioner had protected his hometown and worked hard in the military, and his merits were very great. The country relied on him greatly. He had already been appointed as a member of the Henan Provincial Government and Director of the Department of Civil Affairs. After the war in Henan, compounded by natural disasters, the people were worried. It was especially relied on him to appease the people.

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Soviet Fleet Cruising the Tatar Strait</h3>

<h3>Preparatory Meeting for Disarmament to be Convened in Early November</h3>
<p>Formal Invitation Already Sent Out</p>
<p>France Actively Expanding Navy</p>
<p>▲ Geneva, October 14th, National News Agency: The formal invitations for the preparatory committee meeting on disarmament, to be convened on November 6th, have been sent to 32 countries by the committee chairman, the Dutch representative Loudon. Appended to the invitation is an agenda listing 15 items. Highly contested issues such as air force armaments and reductions in army and navy budgets are all included.</p>
<p>▲ Paris News: After the breakdown of negotiations with Italy at the London conference, the French government is proceeding with naval expansion with unusual seriousness. Recently, the Paris Times published an article featuring a conversation with the French Minister of Aviation, Mr. Dumini, generally stating that he would soon be discussing France's new naval plan with the Minister of the Navy, Alexandre. France is the world's second-largest colonial power, second only to Great Britain. Therefore, France must have a sufficiently powerful navy to protect its national territory and its colonies scattered around the globe. He repeatedly raised this point at the London Conference, asking all parties to pay attention. Now that the situation has not changed, he will naturally continue to make this claim. It is expected that after a detailed discussion with the Minister of the Navy, Alexandre, there will be concrete results. Regarding the training of naval officers, practical navigation experience is indispensable. He hopes that a merchant ship can be hired in the country, or in England or Norway, in the near future, so that 110 naval academy graduates from this year can sail to the Canary Islands and the Aral Sea for practical training to gain experience. In addition, new plans being considered by the Ministry of the Navy, such as reforming the organization of naval battalions and adding lightweight cruisers powered by motors, will be implemented one by one.</p>

<h3>German Social Democratic Party Expresses Support for the Cabinet</h3>
<p>Conflicts Arise Between Extreme Factions</p>
<p>Berlin Metal Workers Strike</p>
<p>▲ Berlin, October 14th, National News Agency: Today, the stock exchange market showed some improvement. Since the disturbances caused by members of the National Socialist Party yesterday, those who sympathized with that party have gradually become aware, and the government's determination to deal with the situation has become increasingly firm. Today, during the cabinet meeting to discuss the government's policy to be announced to the parliament on Thursday, Prime Minister Bruning made such a statement. In addition, when Prussian Prime Minister Braun met with the president, it was reported that the Social Democratic Party in the parliament was preparing to support the Bruning cabinet to prevent power from falling into the hands of the extreme factions. The public also believes that this is a good sign for an early consolidation of the political situation.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, October 15th: After holding a political meeting in Schwerin last night, members of the National Socialist Party clashed with the Communist Party, seriously injuring 15 people.</p>
<p>▲ Berlin, October 15th, National News Agency: Since Tuesday morning, it has been peaceful here. The parliament area is heavily guarded, and several troublemakers have been sentenced to imprisonment by the court as a deterrent. Therefore, it is not expected that the National Socialist Party will attempt to demonstrate again when the parliament meets today. It is currently expected that the Social Democratic Party member Robert Dang will continue to be elected as the Speaker of the House today. The order in the industrial areas is also good. 120,000 metal workers from 276 factories have gone on strike. Only the elderly and weak are allowed by the labor union to continue working to make a living. The staff union has also passed a resolution to act in concert with the striking workers and has ordered the executive committee to take appropriate steps. However, the authorities are trying their best to mediate between employers and workers, and there is still hope for an early resolution of the labor unrest.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, October 15th: The Berlin branch of the metalworkers' union, with 140,000 members, went on strike today to protest the government's arbitration of an 8% wage cut. Large factories such as Siemens are now trying to maintain operations with a small number of personnel. This may further worsen the already serious political situation.</p>
<h3>Spanish Enthusiasm Against Imperialism</h3>
<p>▲ Madrid, October 14th, National News Agency: Although the Spanish government has recently taken severe measures and extensively arrested unstable elements, the situation is deteriorating daily. Throughout the country, there are signs of unrest. The three cities of Mesiya, Triana, and Lerida have now been engulfed in a wave of strikes, and there have been reports of clashes with local police. Lerida is the hometown of Colonel Masia, the famous leader of the Catalan autonomy movement. Although Masia is still exiled abroad, his wife and daughters received a fervent welcome from the public upon their return. The police attempted to intervene, almost causing a riot. This kind of national tension began to erupt today at the University of Barcelona. Students gathered in the campus square, and after the leader delivered a fierce speech against the monarchy, they shouted slogans such as "Down with the King, overthrow the government," and stormed into the school building, smashing classrooms and offices, and throwing photographs of the King into the fire. The director of education was unable to stop them, and the school was declared closed. The University of Granada also had a similar incident.</p>
<h3>French Rivers Overflow</h3>
<p>Navigation Halted, Transportation Disrupted</p>

Several villages in the Meuse River basin have been flooded, and the villagers have been evacuated. The Monsir mines have also been flooded. The Marna River near Aipelei has also flooded several square miles, and railway transportation has been disrupted. However, due to the effective prevention measures taken by the authorities and the completeness of the alarm system, although property losses are huge, there have been no reports of casualties. The meteorological station predicts that there will be more heavy rain.</p>
<h3>16th International Business Conference</h3>
<p>▲ Liege, Belgium, September 27th Communication: The International Business Conference held its 16th congress in Brussels on September 7th. More than 200 representatives from more than 40 countries, including England, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, and Poland, attended. China also attended this time, with representatives Chu Minyi and Liu Xichang. The conference lasted for five days, and the most important resolutions related to China, such as the New International Public Law and the Immigration Regulations, are worthy of attention. The following is a selected translation:</p>
<p>▲ Conference Situation: On the morning of that day, a preparatory meeting was first held in the Belgian Senate to study the proposals and discuss the methods of grouping them. On the morning of the next day, the International Economic Cooperation Group and the New International Public Law Group held small group meetings to discuss them first. The plenary session did not begin until 2 p.m., chaired by former Belgian Minister of Education Dai Gang. The Belgian Prince, representing the Belgian King, gave a speech, saying that one of the points of greatest interest to him at the conference was the difference in tax laws among countries. Therefore, the prosperity and decline of commerce in various countries are related to this, and it is truly an important issue that needs to be resolved urgently. He hoped that the conference would establish a fair tax law, and the most important thing was to maintain world peace, which we all commonly value. Afterwards, representatives from various countries successively gave speeches, and then began to discuss the proposals in groups.</p>
<p>▲ A Glimpse of the Motions: (1) Revising the Charter of the Conference, (2) The case of the New International Public Law relating to the lifeline of global commerce, (3) The problem of European economic cooperation, (4) The problem of unifying the laws governing the sale of goods in various countries, (5) Immigration Regulations, (6) Discussing the reports of previous standing committees, (7) Organizing commercial standing committees regarding colonies and the dissemination of radio.</p>
<p>▲ Four Principles of New International Public Law: (1) Members of this Association should unanimously observe the public interests of all countries and have a spirit of justice, greatness, and cooperation. (2) This Association should strive for the prosperity of the commercial lifeline of the whole world, which is necessary to maintain lasting world peace. (3) Paying attention to the Paris Convention of August 27, 1928, and based on this convention, stipulate a new international public law as follows: "In permanent international public law, it should be recognized that no country may infringe upon the state of peace of another country. In other words, even if international disputes are guaranteed, they must not be resolved by violent methods." (4) This public law belongs to pacifism, but it does not hinder the self-defense, autonomy, and safety of various countries. In the event that a country is invaded by another country, for the sake of self-defense, the conference expresses the following wish: all civilized countries should, in accordance with humanitarianism, pay attention to the lifeline of the global economy, the needs of the new era, and the aspirations of the peoples of all countries, and adopt a policy and method to maintain the future development of the world, and affirm that perseverance is necessary for effective work.</p>
<p>▲ Immigration Regulations: There are a total of five articles in the Immigration Regulations, which are based on the motions of the two immigration conferences in Italy and Cuba. The first article states that "overseas Chinese and domestic people" have absolute equality in civil law. Both the country of residence and the motherland should respect the complete freedom of overseas Chinese. The relationship between overseas Chinese and the motherland, and the relationship between overseas Chinese and the motherland's education, may continue uninterrupted, and they may retain their nationality or enter the nationality of the country of residence. The fourth article: Overseas Chinese in the country of residence should not only be granted the right to enjoy in civil law, but also should be granted all necessary rights in economy and work (equal wages with the people of the country of residence, equal treatment for work accidents, equal enjoyment of trade union rights, and equal public assistance). Rights to protection and enjoyment in society (rights to litigation, access to courts, offices and local government offices). The fifth article: Legislative bodies of various countries should pay attention to formulating laws to severely punish the crime of bigamy, so that legal wives living in the motherland can obtain legal protection.</p>

<h3>Border Area Between China And Japan In Yanbian Had Military And Police Conflict</h3>
<p>▲ Japanese Police Fired First</p>
<p>▲ Then Reinforced With Additional Troops</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: In various parts of Yanbian, Korean Communists are lying in wait, causing trouble from time to time. The Japanese take advantage of this opportunity to sow discord and alienate the feelings between the Chinese and Koreans. On one hand, they increase troops on the Korean border, and on the other hand, they look for trouble when things happen. This is well known. Recently, the Korean Communists have again decided to launch a major uprising in Yanbian on the Mid-Autumn Festival on October 6th, which was detected by our authorities. They ordered the military and police to be on strict alert. On the night of this day, when the troops under the command of Ji Xing, the garrison commander of Yanji and the commander of the 13th Brigade, were on guard at Liudaogou (i.e., Longjing Village), more than ten armed soldiers suddenly came and broke into the line. When asked for the password, they repeatedly refused to answer and instead opened fire. The Chinese army thought they were Korean Communists and had no choice but to return fire for legitimate defense. After further investigation, it was discovered that they were armed Japanese police. The Chinese and Japanese authorities immediately rushed to stop the shooting. It was found that two Japanese policemen were killed and one was injured that night. The Consul-General stationed in Longjiandao immediately exaggerated the incident, ordering an emergency alert as if facing a formidable enemy. He also telegraphed the Governor-General of Korea for emergency assistance. On the 7th, 100 armed policemen were dispatched from the North Hamgyong Police Department and entered Longbu, and the situation was very tense for a time. Our authorities immediately telegraphed the provincial capital for a report. After receiving the telegram, the provincial government immediately convened an emergency meeting of important personnel on the 7th and 8th. As a result, they first telegraphed the civil and military officials of Yanbian, instructing them on the situation and instructing them to adopt a calm attitude. On the one hand, they telegraphed Chairman Zhang in Liaoning to ask for instructions. After receiving a reply, they will instruct them to obey. According to investigations, the Japanese police in Yanbian have often engaged in provocative behavior. In this conflict, according to their own claim, the Japanese police went to a Korean's house to investigate the incident. However, at a time of anti-communist precautions, and in the darkness of night, they did not notify our side, and then they opened fire first. The responsibility for this case should be entirely borne by the Japanese side, which is very clear. However, they took this opportunity to telegraph and transfer large troops, calling them support teams, and taking military actions, making a fuss over a minor issue. The Japanese newspaper exaggerated the situation, saying that the incident was caused by our side and that they hated Japan, etc., which is not the truth. Fortunately, our handling was appropriate, and the scope was not expanded. Otherwise, I am afraid that the Hunchun incident of 1920 will be repeated. It is also heard that the Korean territory across from Yanbian has greatly adjusted its military and police in preparation for a demonstration against us. However, according to diplomatic sources here, this incident was caused by a misunderstanding and will not take a positive turn, and it has now entered the negotiation process. (October 9th)</p>
<h3>Northeast Will Continue To Organize Two Armies To Enter The Pass</h3>
<p>▲ The Organization Of The Third And Fourth Armies Has Been Determined</p>
<p>▲ The Fifth Army Is Also Being Planned</p>
<p>▲ The Air Force Will Implement Total Mobilization</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: In order to implement the principle of peace and cessation of strife, the Northeast is now planning to reorganize the Third and Fourth Armies to continue entering the pass. It is heard that the candidates for army commander are Hu Yukun for the Third Army and Tang Yulin, the Chairman of the Rehe Provincial Government, for the Fourth Army. The First and Second Armies that have already entered the pass have all arrived at their intended destinations except for the Pinghan Line. The Second Army on the Jinpu Line stops in the Dongguang area, and the Dezhou area is garrisoned by Han Fuju's troops. The task of the Fifth Brigade of the First Army on the PingSui Line was originally to pass through Nankou and advance to Kangzhuang. It has already arrived and will not advance further for the time being. The defense of the Jinbei area will be the responsibility of the Fourth Army under consideration when necessary. The 6th Cavalry Brigade responsible for taking over the defense of Zhengding and Shijiazhuang on the PingHan Road arrived at Fangshun Bridge. Because Li Fuying's troops in Wangdu have not yet withdrawn, they sent someone to negotiate and ask them to hand over the defense. As of now, there is no sign of withdrawal. It seems that they will not move until Yan Xishan orders them to do so. However, if they do not withdraw in time, the Northeast Army will also have other takeover methods to complete the second phase of the military plan. As for the defense area of the Third Army after entering the pass in the future, it will either directly garrison along the PingHan Line or take over the defense of Beiping. Nothing is heard about it at this time.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that Hu Yukun, the commander of the Third Army, has been appointed. The army will be established by organizing the 16th Brigade of Miao Zhengliu, the 20th Brigade of Huang Jingzhong, the 24th Brigade of Huang Shiyue, and the 3rd Cavalry Brigade of Zhang Shusheng. The commander of the Fourth Army is Tang Yulin. The Fifth Army will be jointly formed by the Jilin and Heilongjiang armies. Except for the brigades of the Third Army, which are already waiting for orders to move out, the Fourth and Fifth Armies will only move out when necessary. It is also heard that the task of the Third Army is to go directly to Shijiazhuang, or to Beiping to take over the defense of the First Army, and the First Army will then transfer to another place to take over the defense. There is a saying that the task of the Fourth Army is to go to Duolun and then to Chahar and Suiyuan to take over the defense.</p>
<p>The First Army under the command of Yu Xuezhong, originally stationed in Shanhaiguan, has previously been ordered to go to Beiping, Baoding, Nankou and other places. Therefore, the area around Yuguan is defended by the Third Brigade under the command of He Zhuguo. The brigade began to be transported west of Yuguan from the 3rd of this month. The brigade headquarters is located in Yuguan. The 46th Regiment of the brigade, led by Shi Shi'an, is also stationed in Yuguan. The 64th Regiment, led by Li Shufan, is stationed in the area from Changli to Luanxian. The 23rd Regiment, led by Tian Zemin, is stationed in Kaiping, Tangshan and other places. The brigade is responsible for the defense near Yuguan and guards the Guannei section of the Beining Road. Another part is sent to guard Qinhuangdao, Beidaihe and other places. On the 7th, He went to Changli, Lutai, Luanxian, Tangshan and other places to inspect the troops stationed along the line, and asked the public security, business and academic circles of the areas about the local situation. The Fourth Brigade under the command of Liu Yifei has been incorporated into the Second Army. The defense areas of the brigade in Lianshan, Xingcheng, Suizhong and other counties have been taken over by the 12th Brigade under the command of Zhang Tingxu. The areas of Goubangzi and Dahushan in the defense area of the 12th Brigade have been taken over by the 19th Brigade. In addition, the entire Northeast Air Force has also been ordered to implement total mobilization. The original Northeast Air Force was previously organized as an aviation team, and the captain was Xu Shiying. In order to expand its strength, it was reorganized into the Air Force. Zhang Xueliang himself serves as the commander-in-chief, and Xu Shiying serves as the deputy commander. This time, Zhang himself will not be able to personally lead the command due to official business. It is heard that Zhang Huanxiang has been appointed as the acting commander-in-chief of aviation to enter the pass and command everything. (October 9th)</p>
<h3>He Chengjun Takes Over Wuhan Headquarters</h3>
<p>▲ And a narrative of the Third Army Corps' battles</p>
<p>Hankou Quick Dispatch: He Chengjun flew to Hankou from Zhengzhou yesterday, the 11th, and was immediately ordered to act as the director of the Wuhan Headquarters. He originally planned to take office on the 12th, but because that day was a Sunday, he changed it to the 13th. On that day, He went to the headquarters to gather all the staff for a speech, and detailed the Third Army Corps' battles to the press. Some of the details were not covered by the newspapers, so I will record them below. He said, "This war is unprecedented in China. We can know this by looking back at 4,000 years of history. Civil war is inherently a shameful thing, but if we want to overthrow imperialism, we must first eliminate the reactionary elements in the country. Then this war can be said to have supreme value. From the beginning of the war to the end of the military operations, in terms of the number of troops, Feng Yuxiang's core troops, such as Song Zheyuan, Zhang Weixi, Tian Jinkai, Liu Ruming, Sun Liangcheng, Ji Hongchang, Liang Guanying, Zhang Yinxiang, Sun Lianzhong, Zheng Dazhang, Pang Bingxun, etc., totaled about 200,000 people. Yan Xishan's core troops, such as Fu Zuoyi, Li Shengda, Yang Xiao'ou, Guan Fu'an, Sun Chu, Yang Yaofang, Li Fuying, Zhang Huizhao, Zhao Chengzhou, etc., also numbered 200,000 people. Adding to this Sun Dianying, Wan Xuancai, Fan Zhongxiu, Liu Guitang, Ren Yingqi, Wang Zhen, Wang Tai, and other miscellaneous troops, there were no less than 150,000 people. Shi Yousan and Liu Chunrong's two 'gray' troops also numbered 40,000 to 50,000 people. In total, Yan and Feng's troops actually numbered more than 600,000. On the Central Army side, divided into three army corps and two or three general reserve teams, there were also more than 500,000. Judging from the battle lines, from Qingdao, passing through Jinan, Liuhe, to Nanyang, Zhoukou, Haozhou, etc., stretching across four provinces, thousands of miles in length and breadth, the enemy's initial deployment was also very complete. Since we defeated them one by one, they collapsed. Some surrendered to the Central Government in full, such as Ji Hongchang, Liang Guanying, Zhang Yinxiang, Zhang Zhankui, Song Tiancai, and their troops, about 80,000 people. Some were completely annihilated by the Central Army, such as Zhang Weixi, Tian Jinkai, Liu Guitang, and their troops, about 100,000 people. In addition, Yan's troops, Guan Fu'an, Sun Chu, Yang Xiao'ou, and other divisions, were also disarmed. Feng Pengzhu, Fu Zuoyi, Li Shengda, and other troops on the Jinpu Line were eliminated even earlier. Feng's troops who fled north across the Yellow River were only Zheng Dazhang, Pang Bingxun, and Sun Lianzhong's three units, at most no more than 30,000 to 40,000 people. The strength of Yan's troops was only this much. In total, in this battle, the Third Army Corps also went through three dangerous periods: one was when Zhang Gui's army and the communists occupied Changsha, the second was when Feng's army fiercely attacked Guide, and the third was when Jinan fell. During these three dangerous periods, the enemy troops Liu Ruming, Tian Jinkai, Wei Fenglou, and others on the Pinghan front fiercely attacked us, and the battle was extremely fierce. The Commander-in-Chief also telegraphed the 53rd Division to return to Hunan to suppress the bandits. At the same time, the rebel forces also raided Zhumadian from Zhoukou, and the situation was extremely dangerous. At that time, I was in Luohe, and looking around at the situation, I personally went to Dashiqiao and called back the 90th and 2nd armies to temporarily take a defensive position. The turning of this period from danger to safety was entirely due to our 90th and 2nd armies' calm response and the 7th Army's brave advance, which allowed us to get through. Later, due to the urgency of the battle on the Longhai Line, the 9th Army was ordered to be transferred to the eastern front for combat. After the 9th Army departed, Jinan was reported to have fallen again. The turning of this period from danger to safety was entirely due to the Commander-in-Chief's skillful command and the officers and soldiers' dedication. At this time, the 2nd, 7th, 9th, 10th, and 13th armies under my command, totaling five columns, except for the 7th Army, which was not transferred, were all transferred to the Longhai Line, so the Pinghan Line had to temporarily take a defensive position. Later, the Jinpu units all launched attacks towards Jinan and Tai'an, and there were very few troops left on the Longhai Road. In the battle near Minquan County, the Northwest Army attacked our 9th Army with seven divisions. If Commander Shangguan and Division Commander Hao had not responded calmly, then Guide would have been in danger. If Guide was in danger, then Pinghan would have been even more shaken. The 9th Army and the 2nd Army made great contributions to turning this period from danger to safety. After that, our army won victory after victory. Our 10th Army occupied Fugou, Xihua, Yanling, Weishi, Yuchuan, and Zhuxianzhen. The 1st and 2nd armies also recovered important positions such as Qixian and Lanfeng. The Commander-in-Chief, considering that Kaifeng was not a problem, changed the 10th Army to the left wing and raided Luoyang from Zhuxianzhen, traveling more than 100 li per day. After arriving at the designated location, it cooperated with the 7th and 25th armies and successively recovered Yanshi, Gongxian, Dengfeng, Luoyang, and other places. The remnants of Song Zheyuan and Tian Jinkai were surrounded and disarmed by our army near Luoyang. In addition, the 13th Army, with two regiments of troops, resisted several divisions of the Jin Army in Qufu and was able to defeat the rebel forces and shift the battle situation. Its contribution is also truly immortal. Now that the war has come to an end, the remnants of the enemy south of the Yellow River have been completely cleared. The Commander-in-Chief has sent five columns to cross the river and pursue them. The time for the annihilation of Yan and Feng will not be far off. The Commander-in-Chief, because the war is about to end, returned to Nanjing a few days ago, and I was also ordered to return to Hubei at this time. My current responsibility is to suppress the bandits and communists so that the people can live and work in peace," etc. (October 13th)</p>
<h3>Hunan Section Commander Kills County Magistrate Without Authorization</h3>
<p>▲ Luo Cheng, Magistrate of Leiyang County</p>
<p>▲ Killed in the County Office</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: On September 27th and 28th, when the communists captured Anren and Tang Shengming and others captured Yongqi, the southern half of Hunan was in a state of panic. Luo Cheng, the Magistrate of Leiyang County and concurrently the Chief of the Local Defense, was suddenly executed on the 28th for allegedly abandoning his post. Duan Heng, the Hunan Garrison Commander and concurrently the Brigade Commander of the 55th Brigade of the 19th Division, personally drove from Hengzhou to the Leiyang County Office by car. Upon meeting, he shot him dead with a pistol. This is the first case of a Hunan military officer killing a county magistrate without authorization. When the news spread, the whole province was shocked. The surviving family of Magistrate Luo have come to the provincial capital to file a complaint, stating that Luo had been working day and night in his post, supervising the local defense and suppressing bandits, and had never left his post. On the 28th, while he was working in the county office at noon, Commander Duan suddenly arrived at the office by car. Magistrate Luo came out to greet him. Upon meeting, Duan asked why the people of Leiyang County were panicking and fleeing to Hengzhou. Luo replied that it was because the communists were spreading rumors in the county, disturbing the people's hearts, and he was strictly investigating and arresting them. Before he could finish speaking, Duan took out a pistol and shot Luo dead, ordering his secretary, Gui Qiufang, to act as the county magistrate, got back in the car, and left. They are requesting redress, etc. At the same time, Cao Bowen, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, also requested He Jian to clearly define the limits of authority in order to promote the rule of law, as military officers had arbitrarily executed local administrative officials, disrupting the administrative system. He Jian then sent a letter in the name of the Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government to the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, requesting verification and action. However, Duan Heng is currently stationed in southern Hunan, and He Jian is relying on him as a bulwark. In this eventful time in southern Hunan, it is feared that this matter will be difficult to resolve in any way. The text of Duan Heng's telegram and He Jian's official letter are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Duan Heng's Telegram to the Provincial Government (Titles Omitted) The communists' disturbance of Anren and the recovery of Anren by Commander Zeng's troops at noon on the day of the incident have been reported by telegram many times. During the emergency in Anren, Luo Cheng, the Magistrate of Leiyang County and concurrently the Chief of the Local Defense, neither supervised the local defense to go out of the territory to resist the bandits, nor comforted the people to maintain the rear. When the bandits were 200 li away, he panicked for no reason, causing the people of Leiyang to flee to Hengyang. The roads were full of them, and they have not stopped until now. The rumors spread, and southern Hunan was shaken. I repeatedly urged him by telegram to quickly appease them, but he was not in the office. If he abandons his post and disrupts the rear like this, if he is not severely punished, then the counties in southern Hunan will be in chaos before the bandits arrive. Who will bear the responsibility? In order to deter chaos, rectify official regulations, and urge local defense personnel to work hard to resist the bandits, I personally came to Leiyang this afternoon and shot the magistrate and chief Luo Cheng dead, and temporarily ordered his secretary, Gui Qiufang, to act as the county magistrate. I implore you to quickly appoint another virtuous person to take over, or immediately transfer the newly appointed Magistrate Liao of Changning to take over, in order to deter them. I also implore you to issue an order to all county magistrates and local defense personnel that in the future, those who disturb themselves before the bandits enter the territory and those who leave their posts without authorization will be punished by military law, so that those who have the responsibility to defend the territory will know what to be vigilant about, so that they can defend and suppress them. Is this appropriate? Awaiting instructions.</p>
<p>▲ He Jian's Letter to the Headquarters: I am writing to you regarding the telegram from Duan Heng, the Hunan Garrison Commander, stating (see above), etc. According to this, Luo Cheng, the Magistrate of Leiyang County, left his post without authorization during the emergency in Anren, although he deserved it. However, the commander did not report it beforehand and executed him rashly, which disrupted the administrative system of this province. In view of the foregoing, in addition to replying by telegram, I am writing to your department requesting verification and action, and also instructing your subordinates that in the future, no such incidents should occur again with regard to administrative officials in this province, in order to clarify the system. Sincerely, (October 5th)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Communists Plan to Flee to the Fujian Border</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, Lin, Li, and other communist bandits fled from Hunan to Jiangxi. Their plan is to first seize Ji'an and then attack Nanxun. The various armies have launched a large-scale suppression campaign. The New 5th Division, under Gong Bingfan, is advancing towards Gao'an, and from Gao'an, it will attack the waist of Zhu's bandits in Yuanhe. The division has arrived at Wanshou Palace. The communists in Gao'an, fearing that their rear will be cut off, are retreating to Shanggao and Xinyu. The 18th Division, under Zhang Huizan, and the 149th Brigade of the 50th Division, under Yue Sen, are facing Zhangshu. The division headquarters is located in Zhangshu, guarding the west bank along the Gan River. Deng Ying, the commander of the New 13th Division, abandoned Ji'an on the 5th and went along the east bank of the Gan River through Jishui, Yongtai, and Zhangshu to join the 18th Division. As a result, the communists have not been able to succeed. It is reported that most of them have withdrawn from Ji'an and are going straight down the Gan River. Therefore, the battles along the Gan River and the Yuan River estuary are very fierce. However, the communists, with a large army gathered in Nanxun, are definitely planning to cross the Gan River eastward and flee to the Fujian border via Yongfeng, Le'an, Chongren, and Fuzhou. Rumors have been rife in Fuzhou in recent days. Yesterday, I received a phone call from Commander Wang of Linchuan, saying that Fuzhou is still peaceful, but Commander-in-Chief Lu is afraid that the communists will take advantage of the emptiness and flee eastward, and has ordered Deng's division to move towards Fuzhou to intercept them and avoid a loophole. As for the provincial capital, the communists once spied on Zhangshu, and it has been slightly affected. Special martial law has been imposed in recent days, and all entertainment venues have been closed. Pedestrians are cut off at 10 pm, and the electric grid around the city is energized from time to time. The precautions are tight, so it is extremely peaceful. (October 14th)</p>
<h3>Bandit Atmosphere on the Anhui-Jiangsu Border</h3>
<p>▲ Bandit forces in Sixian County are very rampant</p>
<p>▲ The 2nd Cavalry Division has dispatched troops to suppress them</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Sixian and Xuyi counties in northern Anhui border Jiangsu province, with the Huai River in between and Hongze Lake bordering the east. They have always been a haven for bandits, and the ports and streams are crisscrossed, and the reeds are uneven, so the brigands are hiding and multiplying, taking the opportunity to steal. Since the bandits have this natural guarantee, it is not easy for government troops to suppress them. Two years ago, there was a giant bandit Gao Ba, who led more than a thousand men and occupied the area. Since Gao was killed by the army, the bandit atmosphere has subsided slightly. Unexpectedly, in recent months, Jiang Guochang, nicknamed "Three Legs", who has been running rampant in the counties of eastern Anhui, has been repeatedly defeated by the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Cavalry Division in Chuxian County, and it is not easy to gain a foothold. So he fled into the territory of Sixian and Suxian counties, gathering local bandits and fierce bandits south of Suining, Jiangsu, gathering more than a thousand people. In addition, the communist bandits of Shuanggou and Qingyang in Sixian County mixed together, and their momentum was huge. They robbed, burned, and killed. Zhang Haizhou, the magistrate of Sizhou County, and Tang Jieren, the magistrate of Xuyi County, have led police teams and local militias to suppress them in the northeast for nearly a month. Recently, the bandit forces near Shuanggou have been slightly weakened, but the bandit atmosphere in Sixian County has become more intense, and the people have suffered unspeakable hardships. The magistrates of Sixian and Xuyi counties have jointly requested Zhang Lisheng, the commander of the 2nd Cavalry Division, to send troops to suppress them. Zhang immediately ordered the 10th Regiment of the 4th Brigade stationed at Guzhen Bridge, under Zhang Daqing, to go to Sixian County to suppress them. After receiving the order, the Zhang Regiment immediately dispatched troops carrying mortars and machine guns and has now arrived in Sixian to carry out a vigorous suppression. (October 10th)</p>
<h3>Zhan's Division Vigorously Suppresses Local Bandits in Jiaodong</h3>
<p>▲ Wang Ziming's Troops Completely Collapsed</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Wang Ziming's large bandit gang in Jiaodong, after burning and plundering Anqiu Jingzhi Town, fled into the Lizhu area in the southwest of Jiaoxian County, raping, looting, killing, and arson, doing everything. After receiving the report, Chairman Han of the Provincial Government immediately ordered the 73rd Division of Zhan Shutang, stationed along the Jiaoji Railway, to go and suppress them vigorously to eliminate the people's suffering. After receiving the order, Zhan personally led the 218th Brigade to Jiaoxian, and also sent a letter to the Northeast Marine Corps, asking them to send troops to block them to prevent them from fleeing east. Zhan arrived in Jiaoxian yesterday, and the reporter went to pay his respects. At that time, Zhan had already led his troops to set off, and his chief of staff, Zhao Tongshan, received me. Zhao said that Division Commander Zhan is currently serving as the Jiaodong Bandit Suppression Commander and has a thorough plan to eliminate Wang Ziming's gang of bandits. Currently, there are two regiments of our division (Zhao referred to himself) in Zhucheng, actively advancing north. On the east side, the Marine Corps is blocking them. Division Commander Zhan personally led his troops to attack south from Wangtai Town, surrounding them on three sides. The bandits have become turtles in a jar and will be easily wiped out in one fell swoop. Zhao also said that the Jiaodong Bandit Suppression Plan was discussed in detail at the Anti-Banditry conference convened in Weixian County the day before yesterday, and the following resolutions were made: (1) Investigate household registrations and order the county governments to instruct the district chiefs to order the village chiefs to report the names of all bandits in the villages. Those who do not report will be considered to be harboring bandits. (2) Brand guns. After this branding, if any unmarked private guns are found, they will be treated as bandits. (3) Funding. Counties with anti-banditry funds should use them. Otherwise, the districts or villages will raise funds according to the situation. (4) Anti-Banditry Committee Sub-Committee. Each county will have seven committee members produced by various agencies, with the county magistrate as the chairman. The seal will be the county government seal and will not be issued separately. (5) Deadline. Complete the work within 20 days.</p>
<p>Another report: After the anti-banditry troops were deployed properly in Jiaoxian County, they began to attack on the 11th. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the bandit forces were unable to resist and fled in all directions. Many were killed on the spot, and dozens were captured. The rest fled south, and some disguised themselves as merchants and took the Jiaoji Railway to Qingdao to lie low. The city authorities have strictly ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate and arrest them carefully. The bandits who have ravaged several counties have now been completely eliminated.

<h3>Situation in Nanning Under Siege</h3>
<p>▲ Air Force Cooperates with Yunnan and Guangdong Armies to Vigorously Besiege</p>
<p>▲ Agencies in the City Stop Working, Prices of All Goods Soar</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: In the Guangxi war situation, Zhang Gui's army is still deployed between Liuzhou and Guilin, on the one hand, stubbornly occupying Nanning with heavy troops and acting as a corner with Liuzhou, causing the troops attacking Binyang to be unable to go deep, and on the other hand, using Li Mingrui's troops to appear and disappear in the Youjiang area, hindering the Yunnan army in Wuming. The Yunnan army has been besieging Yongcheng for many days, but it lacks artillery fire, and the Guilin army has a very solid defense works in Yongcheng. The fort outside the city is protected by stone fortresses, electric nets and trenches, and the defense line is five degrees, so it has not been captured for a while. Therefore, the Yunnan army specially borrowed hundreds of artillery shells from the Eighth Route Army and transported them to the front line for a vigorous attack on the city. It is reported that these artillery shells were transported to the front on the 2nd of this month, and the 59th Division also transferred a company of artillery from Tengxian to cooperate with the Yunnan army in attacking the city. On the 3rd and 4th, the order to attack has been issued. A unit of the 10th Route Yunnan Army advanced to outside the South Gate, and the 16th Division under Yang Dingzhong, which belonged to the Eighth Route Army, also opened to near Nanning on the 3rd. The Yunnan Army Zhu Xu's division and the entire garrison are now advancing directly from the South Gate to the second line of defense of the Guilin Army. The two divisions of Lu Han and Zhang Fengchun are distributed in the West Gate and the North Gate to cut off the enemy's supply. The Guangdong authorities received a telegram from Lu, the division commander of the Yunnan Army, yesterday, reporting on the recent situation of the siege of Yongcheng, which said, "Our army, with the assistance of the air force, attacked Yongcheng again on the 26th and broke the first line of defense of the rebel army on the same day, but at that time, the bullets had not yet been transported, and your army had not yet arrived, so we did not advance rapidly. By the winter day, your army had arrived in Yongcheng, and the bullets had also been transported and distributed to the divisions for use. The order has been issued to the divisions to join your army in a fierce attack on Nanning, and it can be captured within ten days," etc. The Eighth Route Army immediately dispatched an air force to cooperate with the Yunnan Army in the attack. Huang Guangrui, the Director of the Aviation Department, accompanied the mechanics and drove the Xijiang aircraft to Wu on the morning of the 7th to direct the air force to fight. As for the siege of Nanning for several months, according to Nanning Post Office news, the Yunnan Army attacked Yongcheng again on the 20th of the previous month. The Guilin Army in the city, in addition to defending strictly, had no contact. At around 4 am on the 22nd, when it was not yet dawn, five aircraft suddenly came and threw bombs. At 12 noon, they flew again to reconnoitre and then withdrew. At 4 pm, they circled in the sky again and dropped bombs, causing great damage. In order to avoid the bombs, the people dug holes to live in, and only dared to travel on the road at night. Aircraft have been arriving in the territory in recent days. Since the 20th, the Nanning Post Office and foreign firms have all stopped working. The Yunnan Army detained the mail sent from other places to Yongcheng outside the city, but the mail sent from Yongcheng to various places was released as usual. The city has been cut off for a long time, and the prices of all goods have soared. A dan of rice costs 28 yuan, and only 40 jin of firewood can be bought for one yuan. (October 9th)</p>
<h3>Declaration of the World Peace Union</h3>
<p>▲ Opposes the Conscription System</p>
<p>and Military Knowledge Training for Youth</p>
<p>This museum received a declaration from the World Peace Union yesterday, opposing the conscription system and military knowledge training for youth, so as to fundamentally eliminate war psychology and permanently maintain world peace. The content is roughly as follows: The governments of all countries in the world have formally recognized the noble need for peace and signed the Non-Aggression Pact in Paris, abolishing war as an instrument of national policy. However, they are still carrying out war preparations. It is a great contradiction to declare peace on the one hand and maintain and expand military training on the other. Today, there are two ways to implement military training. Some countries enforce it by law, and others, although nominally listening to the people's voluntariness, still use moral and economic forces to coerce them. In addition, the governments of all countries declare that the state's requirement that male and female citizens serve in war is its absolute right, which is enough to create a ladder of war. We believe that the time is pressing, and all like-minded comrades who sincerely love peace should rise up together and jointly demand the abolition of military training for youth and deny the government's right to conscription. Because conscription puts us completely under military rule, and if we are accustomed to this kind of service for a long time, it will lead to militarism. Military training trains our minds and bodies with the art of killing, and it is actually war education that cultivates the people's warlike hearts and prevents the development of the will for peace. Today's elderly, in schools and public and private organizations, often use the name of physical education to educate the younger generation in war science, which is actually creating a major sin for their children and grandchildren. The Treaty of Versailles has already recognized this and forced the defeated countries to abolish the conscription system and restrict military training for youth. Today, it is time for the people of the world to automatically initiate the elimination of these two major sins. If the governments of all countries still fail to recognize the people's power to oppose war, they will see those who are loyal to mankind and their conscience come out to resist and fight. We urge the people of all countries to rise up together and demand the abolition of militarism and the conscription system and engage in education on humanity and peace. The following signatories are mostly world-renowned figures. Our country includes Gu Ziren, Germany includes Professor Einstein and General Xun Nake, England includes Bishop Baminghan and the great writer Wells, the United States includes Professor Adan Musa and Di Hui, and France includes Marguerite, among others. According to the World Peace Union, it is a joint organization of international organizations such as the International Friendship Association, the International Anti-Militarism Society, the International Women's Cooperative Society, the International Lianhuan Society, the International Anti-Militarism Friends United Association, the Peace Committee of the Friends Society, the International War Resisters' Society, and the International Women's Peace and Freedom Union. Its secretariat is located in Vienna. Anyone who supports this declaration is requested to notify the secretariat of the association and join the signing. The address is: The Secretary of the Joint Peace Council. Vienna VII. Doblergasse 2/26, Austria</p>
<h3>Tokyo-Based Groups in Japan Celebrate Double Tenth Festival</h3>
<p>This year's Double Tenth National Day, various groups in Japan jointly initiated by the Embassy in Japan, the Tokyo Branch, and the Office of the Supervisor of Students Studying in Japan, convened a preparatory meeting to commemorate the National Day and decided to borrow the Mitsui Hall in Tameike to hold a large-scale celebration ceremony. In addition to foreign guests, Kayanaga Tomoyoshi, Okada Arimin, Yoshimi Masato, Yamai Kakutaro, Ono Tokuiichiro, Minagawa Hoen, Mizuno Baikyo, Yutani Kyoichi, Kojima Kazuo, Miyazaki Ryusuke, Kurosawa Jinio, Inukai Tsuyoshi, Kimata Saburo, Shiroiwa Ryuhei, and Sakatani Rihachiro, and dozens of others, about one thousand Chinese male and female students and male and female Chinese laborers gathered together. The presidium consisted of Wang Rongbao, the Ambassador to Japan, Ren Juewu, the standing committee member of the Tokyo Direct Branch, and Wang Keren, the Supervisor of Students Studying in Japan. The meeting opened at 1:00 pm with ceremonies as usual. First, Chairman Wang Keren delivered the opening speech, which stated, "Today, we should look back on the past and also think about the future, recognize the responsibilities of each individual, contribute their abilities to the Party, the country, and the nation, sacrifice their own interests, and spare no effort, and take the Three Principles of the People as our guide." Next, Chairman Wang Rongbao delivered a congratulatory speech, which stated, "To obtain benefits, there must be a price of sacrifice. Military and financial power are not reliable. We should look at the hearts and minds of the people across the country to determine the final victory."

<h3>Repair of the Mingfei Tomb by the Sui Provincial Government</h3>
<p>▲The fragrant mound has not decayed, and the grass is evergreen.</p>
<p>▲More than 3,000 trees have been planted around it.</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from the Border Region: The tomb of Han Mingfei is located more than ten miles southwest of Guisui City. The tomb base is high and stands majestically. Through the ages, weathering and erosion have not caused the fragrant mound to decay, and the grass is evergreen. Backing against the Yin Mountains and facing the Heishui River, the scenery is pleasant, but it is a pity that there are no trees to decorate it, which makes it feel particularly monotonous. This year, the Sui Construction Department has implemented tree planting at the tomb. Taking seeds locally, more than 3,000 trees have been cultivated, swaying in the wind, secluded and lovely. Although the north wind is strong, a wisp of fragrant soul will have a place to rest. The tree planting methods are as follows: (1) The Construction Department supervises the Guisui County Government to instruct the village chiefs of Xingwangzhuang and Jiajiaying, which are adjacent to the tomb, to handle it. (2) The section of land for planting trees will be planted within the relatively flat area around the tomb for the time being. (3) The funds required for planting will be provided by the Construction Department. (4) The labor required for planting will be calculated by the Construction Department based on the number of workers required, and the village chiefs of Xingwangzhuang and Jiajiaying will be directed to distribute and hire labor from the two villages, and wages will be paid daily. (5) The species of trees to be planted will be Yang seedlings with roots from nearby villages, which are easy to survive, because the soil in the area for planting trees is dry and hard. The diameter of the middle section of the tree seedlings is two inches long, and the height is eight feet. (6) The number of plants to be planted is 40 zhang around the tomb, and each plant is planted at a distance of five feet per row. Ten rows are planted in front of the tomb, with 80 plants planted in each row, for a total of 800 plants. Fifteen rows are planted behind the tomb, for a total of 1,200 plants. Ten rows are planted on the east and west sides, with 55 plants planted in each row, for a total of 1,100 plants. In total, there are four sides, with a total of 3,100 plants to be planted.</p>

<p>Educational News Highlights</p>
<h3>The Yuan Decides to Use Min Salt Tax to Fund Education</h3>
<p>▲The surtax within 120,000 is fully used for education.</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan decided that if the income from the Fujian salt surtax is within 120,000 yuan, it will be fully allocated to education funds, and ordered the Ministry of Education to know. According to the Ministry of Finance, the Executive Yuan instructed that according to the Fujian Education Funding Committee, the Yangdian said that the salt surtax of Min Province was designated as a special fund for education. It was previously decided by the Executive Yuan that the audit branch should directly allocate it to the Education Funding Management Office. However, the branch has not given a penny to education funds since June 20, and the branch's own funds have been stored for several months in preparation, etc. Therefore, it should be ordered to the Fujian branch to follow the repeated decisions of the Yuan and not to withdraw the surtax in order to maintain education funds. This order, etc., should be followed. However, the current tax rate of Min salt is only 2 yuan per dan for the regular tax, and 3 yuan for the surtax. From September of last year to the end of August of this year, the branch only collected more than 926,060 yuan for all income items, excluding the surtax, and more than 2,000 yuan for miscellaneous items. Calculated on the basis of twelve months, the monthly income is less than 80,000 yuan on average, while the branch should spend more than 106,000 yuan per month on administrative audit and anti-smuggling agencies, and other temporary expenses are not included. If it only relies on the regular tax to pay, it is really impossible to allocate. Furthermore, the salt surtax was not used to fund education when it was first levied. In June of the 17th year, the Fujian Financial Consolidation Committee decided on the Fujian military quota, the amount of military expenses, and the general outline and methods of military and political expense distribution. The expenditure list attached to the resolution clearly stated that 30,000 yuan per month should be allocated from the salt surtax to subsidize salt affairs expenses, which had been allocated according to the record. Therefore, the surtax is neither an education surtax nor has it been decided by the committee to subsidize salt affairs expenses. Now, the expenses of the salt affairs agencies in the province and other expenditures are seriously insufficient. After thinking about it repeatedly, the only way is to ask the Yuan to issue a clear order to the Fujian Provincial Government to order the salt affairs expenses in the province to be appropriated from the salt surtax by 30,000 yuan per month in accordance with the decision of the committee to make up for the shortage. It is reasonable to submit this request for approval. According to this, it was submitted to the 89th meeting of the Yuan and decided that the income from the Min salt surtax should be fully allocated to education funds when the monthly income is within 120,000 yuan. Only when it exceeds 120,000 yuan can the salt affairs expenses be subsidized according to the case. In addition to the instructions and the notification to the Fujian Provincial Government, the department is hereby ordered to be informed immediately.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Extends Deadline for National Anthem Collection</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education's call for a national anthem has now been extended to the end of this year. The collection methods have also been revised. In addition to a public notice, instructions have been issued to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, stating:</p>
<p>Regarding the urgent need to collect a national anthem for our country, collection methods have been formulated and sent to various provinces and cities for implementation. Now that the collection period has expired, the submitted works from various provinces and cities have been quite numerous. Among them, there are certainly many that meet the standards outlined in the collection methods, but there are also general shortcomings, including: 1. The language is not simple and accessible, making it difficult for those who have not received compulsory or remedial education to understand. 2. The lyrics are lengthy, exceeding 150 characters, making them difficult to memorize. 3. The tone cannot rise and uplift; few rhymes use 丫, 己, 𠀅, 幺, 弓, 尢, 𠃋, or Ｘ𠃋, etc. 4. The meaning of the lyrics contains temporality, such as "400 million people" and "over 4,000 years of culture," which are not suitable for permanent use. 5. The wording is too exaggerated. Since the national anthem is of great importance, it should aim for perfection. A National Anthem Review Committee has been organized to conduct a preliminary review of the collected works. Considering the aforementioned shortcomings, it is appropriate to extend the collection deadline and revise the collection methods to allow both domestic and international individuals to carefully prepare and create a most perfect national anthem. Therefore, in addition to revising the previously established collection methods and issuing a public notice, the revised methods are hereby printed and distributed, and you are hereby ordered to comply with the collection process and instruct your subordinates to issue a unified public notice. This order.</p>
<p>▲Revised Methods for Collecting National Anthem Lyrics 1. Standards for Collecting National Anthem Lyrics: (1) The lyrics must express national characteristics and common ideals to evoke patriotism, national consciousness, and promote the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, guiding the people's direction. (2) The lyrics must be simple and profound, allowing all people, men, women, old, and young, to recite them easily and promote them widely. (3) The lyrics must have a sonorous and uplifting tone, making the public feel happy and encouraged when singing. 2. Applicants must submit clearly written lyrics, stating the composer's name and detailed address, to the Social Education Department of the Ministry of Education before the end of December of the 19th year. Submitting the musical score along with the lyrics is welcome. 3. After collecting all national anthem submissions, the Ministry of Education will invite senior Party and state officials to evaluate them. The results will be announced in February of the 20th year. 4. The selected winner will be awarded 1,000 yuan by the Ministry of Education. Those who do not wish to receive the reward may decline but must declare this when submitting their work.</p>

<p>Yangshupu Shanghai University believes that the border areas of our country, such as Mongolia, Tibet, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, are vast and rich in resources, and that their development is deeply related to the development of the country as a whole. Attention should be paid to research and efforts should be made to develop the borders. Therefore, the university has specially partnered with students to organize the Border Area Issues Research Society for discussion and exchange at any time.

<h3>Director of Physical Education Department of Jinan University, China Women's Sports (2) Chen Zhang'e</h3>
<p>If we want to cultivate children into complete personalities, there are also five elements. The first is aesthetic education. If there is a lady whose posture and physique are outstanding and whose clothes are beautiful, I think no one will not pay attention to that lady, no one will not admire that lady, and no one will not want to get close to that lady. Therefore, beauty can be spectacular, so aesthetic education is an important issue in creating personality. The second is group education. The two words "group education" are also extremely important in life. Readers, think about earlier people, such as Confucius, Jesus, and Lincoln, and closer to us, Wilson and Mr. Sun Yat-sen. No one does not admire them. What is the reason for this? This is because they are selfless, altruistic, and love groups, take the world as their own, and take freedom and equality as their foundation. Therefore, educators all over the world now regard physical education as an important way of moral education. The third is intellectual education. The two words "intellectual education" are the various kinds of knowledge that you study in school. When people are children, our parents send them to school, from kindergarten to primary and secondary schools, and then to university. After graduating, they can go to society to do various kinds of careers. Therefore, intellectual education is an essential element for people to deal with the world, interact with people, and build meritorious achievements.</p>
<p>The fourth is moral education. For example, a certain lady is a graduate of a famous university. She is lively and beautiful and is welcomed by many people in society. No one in society does not love and respect her. Even if this lady has the qualifications of aesthetic education, intellectual education, and group education, her personality is not good, her morals are very bad, her credit is completely absent, and she does all kinds of evil. She can still use her talents to run into society and do all kinds of evil things. In this case, her reputation and personality will soon be declared bankrupt by others and despised by society. If this lady's morals are extremely noble, extremely aware of shame, and extremely clean, people in society will always love and respect her. Who dares to despise her? From the perspective of the individual lady, her future is also bright and she will not fall. It can be seen that morality is the most important thing in life. The fifth is physical education. Now we come to the problem we want to discuss. Suppose this lady has aesthetic education, intellectual education, group education, and moral education, she can be considered to have a perfect personality and go to society to make contributions. However, she is a woman who is weak and cannot bear the wind blowing her clothes. Almost 300 days of the year, she is sick in bed. From this point of view, even if she has excellent skills, I am afraid she does not have the spirit and physical strength to do things, like a tall and magnificent building built on sand. Therefore, if women want to become complete personalities, they must not only pay attention to aesthetic, group, intellectual, and moral education, but also pay attention to physical education. Paying attention to physical education has three major effects. Please explain as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Individual: If an individual pays attention to physical education, its effects are as follows:</p>
<p>The first kind: On the body: the body is strong, the posture is correct, the internal organs are developed, and the lifespan is extended.</p>
<p>The second kind: On intellectual education: quick wit, self-determination, sensitive perception, and sound memory.</p>
<p>The third kind: On moral education: patience, self-respect, perseverance, and noble cultivation.</p>
<p>(2) Society: The effect of paying attention to physical education can benefit society and the people, correct customs, harmonize human emotions, and consolidate social order.</p>
<p>(3) Party and State: The effect of paying attention to physical education is even greater. Regarding the Party and the State, paying attention to physical education is something that we must pay attention to. That is, we can obtain the following effects of loyalty, freedom, cooperation, obedience, optimism, courage, and sacrifice. Since the unification of our country, the important figures of the National Government have made every effort to promote women's physical education. For example, in last year's National Games, women's physical education and various sports achieved great results. In short, the purpose of physical education is threefold (to be continued).</p>

<h3>To Be Dismissed with a Laugh</h3>
<p>— Seafarer</p>
<p>▲Wife (going to a prison to see the prison official)! Officer, please have pity on our family, old and young. Release my husband.</p>
<p>Prison Official — What crime did your husband commit to be imprisoned here?</p>
<p>Wife — This man is too hopeless. He doesn't go to work to earn money. Instead, he stole two hams from someone.</p>
<p>Prison Official — Since he is so hopeless, why do you want him released?</p>
<p>Wife — Because we have already finished eating the hams he stole last time.</p>
<p>▲Son — Father, will you buy me a trumpet?</p>
<p>Father — I don't want to buy one for you. I know that once you have a trumpet, you will blow it all day long, making a terrible racket.</p>
<p>Son — Father, that's okay. I will wait until you are asleep every night before I blow it.</p>
<p>▲A — Old C said that you fought with him yesterday and bit off a piece of flesh from his arm. He is preparing to sue in court.</p>
<p>B — Don't believe his words. I have been a vegetarian for ten years. I would never easily break my fast.</p>
<p>▲Wife (returned to her husband's house after spending half a month with her family). Dear, how did you manage the household while I was away for half a month?</p>
<p>Husband — I only stayed in the house for one night. Then I moved to a hotel.</p>
<p>Wife — Was it because you were lonely?</p>
<p>Husband — No, it was just that after sleeping in the bed for one night, the bedding was all messed up. And the next day there was no one to make the bed for me.</p>
<h3>Gleanings from a Lecture</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The Chinese Vocational Education Society held its second academic lecture at 3:00 PM on Saturday, the 27th of last month. The speakers were Ms. Yang Meizhen, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Women's Temperance Association, who spoke on temperance as a tool for national salvation, and Mr. Hu Shuhua, President of the National Tongji University, who spoke on the reasons for the decline of the Chinese steel industry and the policies that should be adopted in the future. There were many interesting points during the lecture, so I have recorded them as follows.</p>
<p>▲Ms. Yang shouted "Down with concubines!" Ms. Yang was about twenty years old. Her appearance was dignified, and she spoke extremely fluent Mandarin. She said that the three vices of smoking, alcohol, and gambling were enough to wear away the ambitions of young people, waste money, harm people, ruin families, and destroy the nation. People should use their useful thoughts, and useful mental and financial resources to do beneficial things, and promote legitimate entertainment, such as listening to music or playing phonographs, to uplift the spirit. Temperance is something everyone should start with, by not smoking, not drinking, and not gambling. The whole country should unite and work hard to promote the temperance movement. Finally, she said that men in families should not take concubines and should strictly implement a one-man, one-woman system, shouting "Down with concubines!" repeatedly. The audience laughed.</p>
<p>▲President Hu talked extensively about the new steel policy Mr. Hu Shuhua, the former director of the Shanghai Steel Plant, had a face full of thoughts, and looked very much like the beautiful-bearded Lord Guan. He gave a lecture on how China had abundant iron ore, but was unable to develop its own sources of profit, and instead sat idly by while the Japanese occupied the rich iron ore deposits in Benxi Lake, Anshan, and Gongchangling in Liaoning Province. Furthermore, he said that scrap iron on the market was being manipulated and bought up by foreigners, and that there were no large-scale factories to resist this, so that all the railway materials in the country were completely dependent on foreign countries, importing about 60,000 tons each year, resulting in huge losses. The only steel plant in China lacked talent, so it borrowed foreign talent. Unexpectedly, the foreigners only knew how to use raw materials from their own country, regardless of whether China had iron ore. Therefore, when running a steel business, it is imperative to use foreign talent, but one must not be fooled by foreigners. In the future, the country should implement a steel policy. The material construction of the steel policy should begin with the psychological construction of everyone. It is not to make steel for war. During his speech, Mr. Hu frequently bowed his hands, appearing very modest.</p>
<p>It is estimated that more than a hundred men and women listened to the lecture that day, all watching the stage without blinking. This shows the extraordinary appeal of lectures by famous people.</p>
<h3>Interesting Anecdotes During the National Day Celebration</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>The joyous and enthusiastic National Day has passed in the blink of an eye. On that day, celebrations were held everywhere, and the one at Jiaotong University was especially unique and interesting. I will recount one or two anecdotes to tell the readers.</p>
<p>▲Two young ladies propose marriage In the past, the female students of Jiaotong University did not easily join any recreational activities. Perhaps for the sake of National Day, two very enthusiastic female students came out to break the silence of the past. One was the famous Miss Tao Chun, and the other was Miss Wang Hengling, who was known for her social skills and speaking abilities. In the song and dance drama "The Person in the Painting," they sang and danced from beginning to end. Miss Tao wore a golden robe, which made her even more graceful. What they sang seemed to be a segment from "Sunny Side Up." Finally, Miss Wang knelt in front of Miss Tao and proposed marriage. Everyone spontaneously burst into enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>▲Such a temper Mrs. Zhang Shankun, the old classmate, was the female diva of the Qiankun Grand Theater. Since marrying Mr. Zhang, she had long disappeared from the stage. On National Day, Mr. Zhang, due to his relationship with his alma mater, specially invited his wife to join him at the Luomahu party. The wife played Huang Tianba, and Mr. Zhang played a bartender. When they came on stage, the couple smiled at each other. Huang Tianba wanted to drink, and the clever bartender hurried over with the wine. But he refused to pour it into her (his) cup. Tianba insisted on having it poured. So he slammed the table and asked him what was going on. The bartender panicked and said, "Why get angry?" He then quickly smiled and poured the wine, causing everyone to burst into laughter. They didn't know that this was how the plot was supposed to go. They didn't know it was a true expression of Mr. Zhang's inner thoughts.</p>
<p>▲Empty checks at the delegates conference The program originally included a dialect performance, which was guaranteed by the senior students. The method was to have students from various provinces speak in their own local dialects when the delegates conference was being performed. It was originally a very interesting event. And the Jiaotong University Three-Day Newsletter also promoted it. Who knew that from beginning to end, the delegates conference was missing in action. No one knew why it turned into an empty check. In the evening, it was all Beijing opera. The performances by Zhong Qiying, Xu Hou, Wu Chengbing, and others all showed significant improvement. This is worth celebrating.</p>
<p>▲A grand banquet in the Wen Zhi Hall President Sun Zhesheng and Li Yaosheng hosted a banquet in the Wen Zhi Hall to celebrate National Day. They entertained all the faculty, staff, and student representatives. Talking, laughing, eating, and smiling. It was also a memorable grand event during the National Day celebrations.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Shenshang Club's Color Rehearsal on National Day</h3>
<p>— Old Fool</p>
<p>Recently, Beijing opera has been popular, and amateur troupes have sprung up on the sea like bamboo shoots after a rain. The Beijing Opera Department, which was added to the Nanjing Road Shenshang Club last month, has become known for its central location and perfect arrangements. On the Double Tenth National Day, a color rehearsal was held to celebrate. I will briefly record the plays I saw that day below. Mr. Tu Kaizheng's "Baishuitan." In the past, Li Chunlai's Eleventh Son and Xiao Kuiguan's Green-Faced Tiger in this play were the best of their generation. Mr. Tu focused on copying Chunlai, and his skills were very deep. He performed the Eleventh Son's frustration and melancholy at not being recognized for his talents, and he vented his depression by upholding justice when he encountered injustice on the road. This section was performed with great thoroughness. The spearmanship and staff work were also very tight and exciting. He is worthy of being an old hand. Rong Junboming's "Drunken Concubine" showed great skill in the two segments of exploring the sea and lying fish. Several sections of the ballad were as pleasant to the ear as the melodious warbling of an oriole. Mr. Zhang Zhongyuan's "Beating Yan Song" was able to imitate Qilin Tong very vividly. You Junjusheng's "Phoenix Mountain" was full of energy and spirit, and was also similar to the vigorous Li Jirui. Xu Junzaiying's "Wulongyuan" sang the ballad with great flavor. Dong Jizhichu, He Junqiliang, Zhang Weinming, and Li Chuanneng jointly performed "Tianshuiguan." Dong, an old amateur on the sea, used to sing bearded roles. Because he had not been on stage for a long time, he suddenly felt inspired that day and played a young male role, forcing his throat to make a sharp and crisp sound, which was quite amusing. This was just for fun. He Jun played Kong Ming, taking the three-beat and one-eye seriously. Zhang Jun played Jiang Wei, with many years of experience, his skills were very skilled. Li Jun played Zhao Yun. Although it was his first time on stage, he was able to do his job well. In the main show, Li Junbaishui's "A Handful of Snow" continued with "Interrogation and Assassination of Tang." A Handful of Snow played Mo Cheng, and Assassination of Tang played Lu Bing. Lu Bing designed to subdue Tang, and the section on how to fulfill Xue Yan's chastity was done with great meticulousness and detail. He was truly a master. Guan Hongbin played Tang, describing all kinds of ugliness. He portrayed the ugliness in great detail. Ms. Xu Meiyun played Xue Yan. She sang the slow aria of Erhuang, and her singing was excellent. Furthermore, the sadness of the lyrics made it all the more moving. After the play ended, the clock struck two. I returned home to write this record. This is also a theatrical tale worth telling amidst the celebrations.</p>
<h3>Jottings from Autumn Sounds</h3>
<p>— Shuangqiu</p>
<p>"Zhuhenji," or the complete "Shepherd's Scroll," is excellent in every scene, without a single superfluous detail. Among them, the scene where Zhu Chundeng joins the army on behalf of his uncle first opens with a family meeting, where each person's thoughts are depicted one by one. Then, Zhao's proposal determines Song's fierceness, Song Cheng's cunning, Chundeng's righteousness, and Zhao's virtue. These are all revealed in this scene, foreshadowing the subsequent events with tight and clever planning. The way they look at each other during the meeting, with sharp confrontations, is quite remarkable. Yanqiu, who plays Zhao, portrays the boldness and decisiveness of the meeting, the alertness in the mill room, and the hunger and cold she faces as she accompanies her daughter-in-law on the shepherd's mountain, grieving her own fate while forcing a smile to bring joy. Her performance of the wind swirling, the rabbit rising, and the hawk falling is graceful and wonderful, as if one were truly in a desolate, snowy mountain. Seeing these helpless people in such dire circumstances is a truly tragic sight, leaving one at a loss for tears. The "Nan Bangzi" she sings in the mill room is full of infinite sorrow, while the fast-paced scolding of Song Cheng is passionate and intense. The "Erhuang" song on the shepherd's mountain twists and turns a thousand times, yet remains controlled and smooth. The scholar Han said that when energy is abundant, speech should be long or short, and the pitch of the voice should be high or low accordingly. It is fitting that Yanqiu's fame is not undeserved. In the scene of begging for food under a mat shed, the singing is focused and complete. Zhao Jingxian's kneeling and tears in the sentence "Kneeling at the mat shed, pearls of tears fill her face" is graceful and melodious, unprecedented. The following "Slow Melody" in the role of the venerable lord has a twisting and artistic tone. The excellent posture of the Central Army holding a knife and threatening the kneeling step in the sentence "To match her husband, Zhu Chundeng" is unmatched. The transformation to Erliu, with her singing and acting, captures the essence of sending off with longing. The tone of crying "Lord Hou, ah!" is mournful, fully expressing a heartfelt sorrow. The way she breaks the bowl to test her hand is extremely lifelike, perfectly portraying her frightened expression. When she first sees Zhu Chundeng in the mat shed, her portrayal of wanting to recognize but daring not to recognize her husband is excellent and special. There is no one more considerate and detail-oriented in acting.</p>
<p>Wang Guiying in "Baolian Deng" is the daughter of a prime minister and the wife of a champion. If the actors are not careful, they often lose their proper status. The excellence of Yanqiu in this play is beyond words. Her stage presence and expression are elegant and dignified, truly rare and precious.</p>
<h3>An Account of Italian Art Observation (II)</h3>
<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>The museum displays paintings on three floors, divided into two major corridors on the left and right. The corridors are about one Chinese li long. Original sculptures are placed along the corridor's passage, one every few steps. On the right side of the corridor, you can enter the painting display rooms, from the first room to the twenty-sixth room, which all display famous works from before and after the Renaissance. In addition, there are several rooms of modern paintings and foreign famous paintings. This time, I came to Italy specifically to study ancient paintings. I spent two days looking at the Uffizi. Below, I will briefly record the famous Italian works.</p>
<p>Botticelli's famous works "The Birth of Venus" and "Spring" are both displayed in the counter. Botticelli was a pioneer of Renaissance painting. Raphael was greatly influenced by him later. Botticelli's painting "The Birth of Venus" was originally based on realism, combined with his own rich ideals and beautiful emotions, transforming it into a dreamlike beauty. The colors are like jewels, and the feeling is bright and cheerful. The elegance and charm of the painting express the ultimate of human emotion. The description of "Spring" uses symbolic spring tones. A group of girls dance in a garden with a riot of flowers, expressing the ultimate of human joy. Although these two paintings are vibrant, there is a subtle sense of melancholy, like the end of a century ripe with decay, overflowing within them. However, from Botticelli's aestheticist paintings, Raphael later emerged, born from the intoxication of forms derived from this feeling. The English Pre-Raphaelite paintings of the seventeenth century were also based on Botticelli's art. Therefore, Botticelli's art had a great influence on later generations. The above two works are his most representative. There are also many other fine works, but I will skip them for now.</p>
<p>Raphael's paintings, totaling more than twenty, are displayed in a large room. The room is decorated with red satin. Raphael was the darling of his era, one of the three masters of the Renaissance. Although he had a short life of only thirty-seven years, he left behind the most works. In addition to screen paintings, he also depicted portraits of popes and nobles of the time. In that room, there is a portrait of a cardinal in red robes, which is a masterpiece by Raphael.</p>
<h3>Heart's Warmth (294)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Fourteen: Emerald Bamboo Tears Stain Her Face, Heartbroken; Lotus Fragrance Fades, a Maiden's Soul Departs</p>
<p>Ah Jin was just about to seize the opportunity to probe his intentions. She said, "Some people say that the master has taken a concubine outside and rented a small house. I don't know if this is true or not." Gengsheng gave a cunning smile and said, "The master taking a concubine, what does that have to do with you? Are you jealous?" Ah Jin punched him lightly and said, "Nonsense! Don't you go spreading rumors and ruining people's reputations. I heard people say that the master has a small residence outside, and you are in the same boat with the master. The master is having fun, and you're taking advantage of it too. One day you'll get caught. If the mistress finds out, not only will the business stop, but you'll probably get slapped in the face!" That Gengsheng, who had also drunk some wine that day, took advantage of his inebriation to ingratiate himself with Ah Jin and said, "I won't say this to anyone else. You're one of us. I'll tell you, but you must never tell anyone else. Especially not in front of the 'tigress'. Don't let a word slip out. The master has taken a new concubine. She's a courtesan from a brothel. She's several times more beautiful than the mistress here. She's also gentle and good-tempered. She doesn't put on airs with us at all. She often asks me about things in the main house with a smile. Behind her back, she also talks about how the mistress is and how the second young master is. She often gives us one or two dollars." Ah Jin said, "Oh, so there really is a small house outside. No wonder he often comes back late at night. Once, he said he was going to Qingdao. I'm afraid he was just telling a lie, right?" Gengsheng said, "He never even went to Qingdao. The idea of going to Qingdao was thought up by Uncle Yu. He told our master to say he was going to Qingdao so he wouldn't have to go home for at least ten days." Ah Jin said, "Isn't Uncle Yu the mistress's brother? Why isn't he helping his own sister? Instead, he's helping his brother-in-law come up with lies." Gengsheng said, "Let me tell you, men always help men, and women always help women. Brothers and sisters are not related." Ah Jin said, "So you always help the master outside, helping the master tell lies. I'm at home, so naturally I'm helping the mistress. I'm going to tell the mistress about this and let them have a fight." Gengsheng quickly smiled and said, "You must never reveal this. Otherwise, not only will my business stop, but I'll really get slapped in the face. And I won't be able to meet you often anymore." Ah Jin said, "You're so timid. A few words have turned your face yellow. I won't say anything now, but if you dare to bully me again, I'll tell everyone that Gengsheng is the one who procured the concubine for the master. See if you can handle that." After Ah Jin got this information, she didn't say a word to the mistress. However, she occasionally let it slip to her colleagues. The kitchen and the gatehouse were the clubhouses and meeting halls for the male and female servants. These were the places where they talked about their masters. In just a few days, all the servants knew for sure that the master had a small residence outside.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Market Outlook is Good</h3>
<p>▲Short positions rush to cover swap deals nearing expiration</p>
<p>▲The bullish side is showing a strong presence</p>
<p>▲Steady Upward Progress. Yesterday, the 15th, the gold price showed a remarkably strong and impressive trend. From morning to closing, there was a difference of six taels, while the initial trading volume was just over one tael. The process was quite good, suggesting a large drop followed by a small rebound. As for foreign exchange, it remained relatively stable with strong intentions among dealers. Buyers were active in the market, mostly shorts eager to cover their positions because swap deals were nearing expiration. The market environment was forcing them, and the bulls held the spot goods. This meant that they had a strong position. In the earlier market, YUAN CHENG, YUAN HSING, YONG DA, DE CHENG, HSIEH YU, and hedgers were all competing to buy. On the selling side were HENG HSING, PING HSING, FU CHANG, and the Dalian group. As for the market price, it started flat, but as the silver price rose, the buyers displayed their strength, driving it up to sixty-seven taels. In the later market, because it was Wednesday, the foreign exchange market was closed as usual, but the demand from various firms exceeded supply. TAI KANG, RUN TAI HSING, YUAN CHENG, YONG DA, and DE CHENG all bought, while the sellers were mostly retail investors. Furthermore, HSIEH YU, TONG TAI CHANG, YONG CHENG CHANG, YUAN HENG, and WAN HSING had already made swap deals. Initially, the bulls paid six taels, then slightly over six taels, and then between five and a half to six taels. It is said that the total amount of November forward contracts was about forty thousand taels, with a considerable portion being for currency arbitrage. As a result, the market price surged, almost reaching the peak of the day, soaring to five hundred and seventy taels. A market that had been calm for many days suddenly surged by five to six taels before the swap expiration, making it unpredictable.</p>
<p>▲Peaceful Opening. The November contract opened at five hundred and sixty-four taels and four mace in the morning, up four candareens (although the raw price touched four candareens). Subsequently, large transactions added one-sixteenth, and the silver price rose three-eighths, while the exchange rate fell one-sixteenth. People's confidence remained stable, and they were not moved. Later, it rose from sixty-four taels and two mace to five mace and nine candareens, with ZHI FENG, YONG TIAN YU, YONG YI, YU SEN, and CHANG YONG buying. The foreign exchange market was also firm. Mitsui bought the near-term Dalian contract at one tael, two mace, five fen, and five li. The far-term Ying Kin Bank made mutual deals at seven pence five six two five. However, when the first order was announced, it was sixty-five taels three and four candareens, and the listed price did not change. Then, Sumitomo offered next month's gold at one tael, two mace, five fen, and two li five, and HENG HSING and others sold, causing it to drop to sixty-four taels and five mace. Later, Sumitomo offered again, with US dollars at thirty-nine yuan and five jiao. He Lan bought January at thirty-nine yuan, sixteen fen, and eleven li. There were still many buyers in the market, so it was sixty-six taels at 10:20 AM. Half an hour later, it decreased by one tael, about five taels. After that, the market became calmer. The November Ying Kin contract could be settled at one seven five six two five. Until 11:30 AM, HSIEH YU, CHUN FA, YONG, and others rushed in, reflecting an increase of two taels. At 11:45 AM, it reached sixty-seven taels. When the market closed at noon, it was sixty-six taels and two mace because HENG HSING and others sold, causing it to fall back a few candareens. The quoted price was still six hundred and ten taels and two candareens, down forty-four to forty-five taels. The registered prices were seventy taels for the current month, sixty-six taels for the next month, seventy taels for the make-up water, and seventy-four taels for the afternoon. The spot goods opened at four taels and three mace in the morning, closed at five taels and eight mace at noon, six taels and four mace in the afternoon, and seventy taels at closing.</p>
<p>▲Frequent Trading. The firms that bought included TIAN YU YONG, YUAN DA YONG, CHANG SHENG YONG, CHUN YUAN YONG, CHUN FA YONG, YUAN HSING YONG, YUAN CHENG, YONG KANG, DA DE CHENG, and those hedging spot goods. HENG HSING, SHENG DA, YUAN HENG, FU CHANG, LIANG HSING, SHUN LI, WAN HSING, and YUAN CHENG YONG were all sellers. HSIEH YU, YI FENG YONG, FU YU, and YUAN MAO YONG first sold and then bought. ZHI FENG YONG, YU DA SEN, and others had frequent transactions. In the afternoon, TAI RUN, TIAN YU YONG, TAI HSING, DA DE CHENG, YUAN CHENG YONG, TAI HENG YUAN, and others bought. SHUN LI, WAN HSING, and YUAN CHENG YONG occasionally sold. HENG HSING, SHENG HUO, CHUN YUAN YONG, and retail investors sold slightly. The Dalian group sold over a thousand taels and bought two to three hundred taels. The Guangdong group sold a total of two thousand taels, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Rates and Domestic Markets Improve</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market continued to rise, but exchange rates fell. There were no rises or falls in Yokohama and Kobe. The HSBC listed rates for various currencies remained unchanged. However, the domestic market seemed slightly better, mainly because the gold price had risen. From morning to noon, there were no special changes, and the trend was peaceful. Compared to the 14th, the English gold rate decreased by zero six two five, the US dollar rate decreased by one eight seven five, and the Japanese gold rate increased by three seven five. In the afternoon, because it was Wednesday, there was no market as usual. Chinese merchants bought slightly, but trading was not very active. Approximately 100,000 pounds were traded, with banks occasionally making mutual deals of several tens of thousands of pounds. Also, Sumitomo, Xingye, and Taiwan Yuli sold some, which were currency notes套回 from the gold industry. Approximately 100 to 200 thousand US dollars were settled, and some tens of thousands of dollars were sold. As for the Japanese exchange rate, the Dalian group sold slightly, while other firms settled a small amount. Overall, the market was relatively stable yesterday, and the large transaction代日 may have shown a downward trend.</p>
<h3>Silver Prices Continue to Rise, Exchange Rates Stabilize</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to London telegraphs, the spot silver price continued to rise, and the buying was attributed to Chinese purchases. Small transactions, the market situation was calm, and there was an intention for US selling after the close. The market was quite active and firm, with near and far futures both up zero six two five, both at sixteen pence eight one two five (equivalent to one shilling seven pence eight seven five in English gold). Also, according to New York telegraphs, the US silver price also rose by three seven five, to three dollars and six cents one two five. The English rate against the US dollar fell by zero three one two five, to eight jiao and five fen eight one two five Japanese yen. The US dollar against the English pound remained at four dollars, eight jiao, five fen, seven eight one two five. The Japanese yen against the US dollar fell slightly by zero six two five, to forty-nine yuan and five jiao six two five. The English yen against the English pound remained at seventeen out of thirty-two parts of two shillings. The English Shanghai shilling plus one two five, to one shilling seven pence eight seven five. There was no telegraph from Mumbai. Also, at 10:50 AM this month, Reuters reported that the Japanese yen against the US dollar remained at forty-nine yuan and five jiao six two five, and the English yen against the English pound remained at fifteen out of thirty-two parts of two shillings. Also, the nine thirty電通社 telegraph came, and there were no changes. The bid and ask prices for the near-term Japanese yen against the US dollar were still forty-nine yuan and five jiao six two five to six two five, and the bid and ask prices for the English yen against the English pound were still fifteen to seventeen out of thirty-two parts of two shillings.

There were no gains or losses in telegraphs until noon, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Coins Experienced a Negative Impact</h3>
<p>▲Sales Not Weak... Market Price Fell Instead</p>
<p>▲General Market Conditions. Everything is hard to predict; this saying is a warning. Looking at yesterday's foreign coin market, its sales volume and the proportion of transactions in the market were higher than in the past, and the trend was also very strong and favorable. Unexpectedly, the market price turned downstream. The reason for this is inexplicable. It is generally said to be due to an oversupply, which shows that human sentiment and business conditions are mostly difficult to predict. As for the ease of the money market, it is indeed due to the congestion of funds in the banks. However, the demand is not as slack as before.</p>
<p>▲Exchange Rates. (Foreign Coin) The early market price was seven mace, two fen, six li, seven hao, and a half. The afternoon market price was seven mace, two fen, six li, six hao, and two hu and a half. As a result, the early market price was one li lower than the previous day. Although it was a gradual decrease, the situation cannot be said to be sudden. (Silver Exchange) The money market showed a loose trend again, and the silver exchange rate followed the trend and became cheap. The early market price was six fen, and there was no change in the afternoon market price. The banks did not list prices, and the划頭加水 weakened as a result, only making two or three fen, and some even making blank劃頭.</p>
<p>▲Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions. Jiangnan small foreign coins were six mace, four fen, and eight li in the early market, and six mace, four fen, and seven li in the afternoon market, which seemed to be one or two li better than the previous day's afternoon market, but trading was limited.

Chinese merchants received and released over 2.2 million in notes, foreign merchants received and released 1.6 to 1.7 million in notes, and various cargo, tax, and miscellaneous payments received and released 7 to 8 million. 800,000 were released from the warehouse. Japanese merchants received and released over 2.8 million in various payments and released 400,000 from the warehouse. Due to the large biqi 期 on the 15th, and the large number of long-term contracts expiring, the amount of money received and released by Qian Zhuang 銀公單 was very large, totaling over 50 million. The amount received and released for划頭 was over 3.7 million, and the amount received and released for various remittances was over 1.2 million, with several tens of thousands in cash received. (Foreign Coin) In the morning market, 1,335,000 in remittances and notes were made, with no transactions in banknotes.

<h3>New Information on Current Long-Term Loans</h3>
<p>The long-term deposits made by the silver and money industry in April of the first half of this year are due to expire in this month. According to the previous expiration on the 10th, there were originally several million, but due to the Double Ten holiday, the investigation was lost. Yesterday (the 15th) was the second batch of expirations, amounting to no less than tens of millions. In normal times when the market is stable, transfers or withdrawals are usually allowed at will. However, because of the current precarious commercial outlook, the silver and money industry, which controls financial power, must exercise strict caution in order to prevent problems. As a result, a large number of long-term loans are mostly unwilling to be transferred. If they are all forcibly withdrawn, it will inevitably cause great risks. Therefore, yesterday, more than half of the debtors requested renewals. It is said that there have been no results, so the interest rate on loans has not been officially announced. As for deposits, given the difficulty of making loans, deposits are bound to be ignored, and most are willing to repay. It is difficult for us to predict how the situation will be adjusted in the future. It should be known that the current difficulties in the financial industry and trade are undeniable. It is also said that the Ningbo financial community has made many loans in Shanghai, and is now sending personnel one after another to prepare to come to Shanghai next week to handle long-term deposits. There will be a lively market at that time.</p>
<h3>The Securities and Bond Market Shows a Trend of Recovery</h3>
<p>▲Stable Trend... Sparse Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday, although various spot government bonds were offered, the transactions continued to be slow, totaling only 6,700 yuan. The futures market was even more quiet, with only over 3.1 million yuan traded in the morning and only over 2.6 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling 5.81 million yuan. Among them, 2.1 million yuan were for disarmament bonds and approximately 1.4 million yuan were for 1929 Customs bonds. The rest were even more scarce. As for the changes in various government bonds, the entire 6th issue, Rehabilitation bonds, and the 96th issue, the transactions in the morning and afternoon markets were sparse, and the prices remained largely unchanged. The Customs bonds were slightly better in the early morning, but remained stable thereafter. The rest of the 1929 Customs bonds, 1929 Cigarette bonds, and Demobilization and Disarmament bonds remained stable in the early morning. Later, because large investors did not sell, and small investors bought some, the prices fluctuated slightly and became firmer, but the trend was consistently very peaceful. As a result, the 1929 Customs bonds for November rose by nine and a half jiao, and the Demobilization 1929 Cigarette bonds each rose by six or seven jiao. However, the spot price of Disarmament bonds has been absent for a long time and has fallen by 2.7 yuan compared to the first ten days of the month, it is said.</p>

<h3>Yarn Prices Plunge Below the 50 Tael Mark</h3>
<p>▲Spot Yarn Also Drops by Five Mace to One Tael</p>
<p>The yarn market experienced a sharp decline in the middle of last month. Later, due to the good news of peace, the situation became firm and rebounded by six to seven taels. The war had been spreading for seven months, and yarn sales were stagnant, resulting in an increase in inventory to over 130,000 bales, and the market conditions were weak. Now, unification is expected, and there is hope for smooth actual sales. It is possible that this huge inventory will gradually disappear, and the market conditions will turn from a weak state to a path of progress. However, overseas market conditions have repeatedly reported declines. Although actual sales are more lively, they are still not the actual needs of the mainland. The rising trend has been hindered, and the situation has been hovering between fifty-two and fifty-three taels for two weeks. Recently, the sales of spot yarn have still not been smooth, and overseas market conditions are still weak. The yarn market has fallen again. The scope of this war has been wide and the duration has been long. The autumn harvest is hopeless, and the vitality has been lost. In areas without war, banditry is everywhere, the prices of agricultural products are low, and sales are difficult. People's purchasing power is weak. Therefore, although the situation is optimistic and transportation is gradually recovering in various places, the actual needs are difficult to improve. The peak season for autumn sales seems to have been disappointed, and sentiment is tending towards pessimism. The rising trend that appeared due to the news of peace in the situation has disappeared again. Judging from the current situation, the decline in market conditions does not seem to be coming to an end. The biggest force in stabilizing the yarn market is actual sales. Other factors, such as the trend of overseas markets and the situation of the cotton market, are all in a position of oppressive force. Now, actual sales are unlikely to be smooth, and this huge inventory will have no way to disappear. Looking to the future, it seems difficult to advance to a stable position in the near future, and it will hover at a low peak, waiting for actual sales to advance or retreat.</p>
<p>▲Marked Yarn Plunges. At the opening of the marked price futures market, the market sentiment was extremely weak. Due to the slight drop in US cotton, the situation remained weak. Retail investors sold in droves, and each fell by two, five candareens. The market conditions in the two or three盤 were extremely weak. Sellers flocked in, and each month fell below the 50 tael mark. Some factories in the market were buying, but the general trend was difficult to support. Each month fell by one tael, three, four, five candareens. In the afternoon, it was heard that actual demand was not smooth, and the market sentiment remained weak. The near months fell by another five, eight, six candareens. At the close, Xincheng bought in the far months and rebounded again. The total transaction volume for the day was 31,450 bales. It was found that Deji sold 2,000 bales, Tianchang 1,850 bales, Rongxing 1,600 bales, Lichang 700 bales, Xiesheng 900 bales, Daji 800 bales, and Dachangcheng 1,500 bales. The rest were three, seven, and hundred bales. Yudai bought 1,250 bales, Gongtai 1,350 bales, Gengfeng 2,850 bales, Xincheng 2,850 bales, and Yichang 950 bales. The rest were four, seven, and hundred bales. The closing prices of the marked prices are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Marked Price Rise/Fall Inventory Closing Price Rise/Fall Inventory</p>
<p>October 1499 Down 16 25,200 January 1487 Down 1 34,900</p>
<p>November 1487 Down 22 37,550 February 1493 Down 14 27,050</p>
<p>December 1486 Down 19 39,250 March 1496 Down 14 7,700</p>
<p>▲Spot Sales are Flat. It was found that the total number of bales bought by various gangs throughout the day was 816 bales. 50 bales were entered among peers. The market dropped by five candareens to one tael. 116 bales were entered from Yunnan by merchant gangs, 280 bales from Sichuan, 75 bales from inland areas, 55 bales from Jinan, 50 bales from Guangdong, 90 bales from Shantou, and 150 bales from miscellaneous gangs, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market in Turmoil</h3>
<p>▲ Pessimistic Prospects: The third government estimate for this season's U.S. cotton harvest is 14,486,000 bales. This is due to favorable weather for cotton harvesting, hence the repeated increase in reports. If good weather continues, the fourth government estimate may slightly increase to 14,500,000 bales. In any case, this season's cotton yield can be considered certain. However, the consumption situation is quite pessimistic. According to various reports, the cotton textile industry in various countries is trending towards decline. The end-of-season carryover figures are likely to set unprecedented records. Furthermore, the unsatisfactory general price level and repeated appearance of new low prices, despite the government's efforts to provide relief, have failed to reverse this downward trend. According to a New York telegram, the meeting in New Orleans on the 13th to discuss relief for the cotton market failed to produce positive results. It only advised farmers to reduce cotton acreage next year and not rush to sell new cotton. However, in terms of general prices, the decline in cotton prices has been relatively缓和, as the price is higher compared to other products. Without special forces, it seems unlikely to deviate from the general price trend. Indian cotton is also in a slump due to smooth production and reduced consumption. It is difficult for overseas cotton markets to recover temporarily. There is no overall estimate for domestic new cotton production to rely on. Early cotton harvests are generally poor, while late cotton is relatively good. Due to the delayed weather picking and inland transportation obstacles, the amount of new cotton on the market is still small. However, those in need, such as spot traders, are demanding higher prices due to the local poor harvest, while foreign cotton is repeatedly depreciating to seek sales, resulting in a large number of orders. According to the Yarn Mill Association, although domestic yarn mills have seen an increase in raw cotton consumption in the first half of this year, the increase rate for U.S. and Indian cotton is 59%, while Chinese cotton is only 26%. Foreign cotton inventories have increased by 74%, while Chinese cotton has decreased. Furthermore, according to customs reports, the import of Indian cotton has reached a massive 1,680,000 piculs, and U.S. cotton has reached 630,000 piculs this year to date, excluding outstanding orders. It is said that Japanese factories have already placed orders up to March next year. In the past, the dumping of new cotton in August and September was a daily occurrence, but this year it has been silent, indicating that manufacturers have sufficient preparations. Some even hope to export, but this is unlikely to be fulfilled, as Japan used to be the main export destination, but has gradually decreased in recent years. Moreover, the prices of Indian and U.S. cotton are low and the quality is good, making it difficult for Chinese cotton to compete. Therefore, it is not easy to increase the export figures. However, domestic merchants are temporarily not paying attention to the international situation. The perception of poor domestic cotton production has not yet changed, so there may not be drastic changes in the short term. In summary, the current cotton market is in a state of crisis on all sides, and a stable market is unlikely in the near future.</p>
<p>▲ Lackluster Han Standard: The Han Standard market initially opened lower due to the weakness of U.S. cotton, declining by 2.3 cents. A portion of short positions were covered in the afternoon, slightly increasing by 0.05 to 0.1 cents. However, spot cotton sales were quite brisk, with a total of 700 piculs traded throughout the day. Sales figures: Changji 4,600 piculs, Zhenda 4,800 piculs, Shenchang 4,300 piculs, Yu Chang 4,300 piculs, Lichang 2,400 piculs, Gengfeng 1,600 piculs, other 1,200, 900, and 100 piculs. Purchases: Tianlong 4,200 piculs, Yuande 2,300 piculs, Hengde 5,200 piculs, Maoji 3,100 piculs, Hengyi 2,300 piculs, other 1,200 and 300 piculs. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>U.S. Cotton Weak, Osaka Three Items Recover</h3>

<h3>U.S. Cotton Relief Meeting</h3>
<p>▲ No Positive Results</p>
<p>New York Telegram: A meeting was held in New Orleans on the 13th to discuss the issue of relieving the cotton market. Officials from the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, and representatives from the banking sector attended. The results of the discussion included: (1) Considering the reduction of cotton fields next year due to the cotton market being below the cost of production, and hoping that textile merchants will prepare for next year's raw cotton; (2) Advising farmers to harvest quickly, postpone sales except for their own needs, and reduce the planting of cotton fields next year, etc.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market to Continue Falling</h3>
<p>▲ Zhabei: Yesterday, more than 30 rice boats arrived in Shanghai from various routes. Market sales were sluggish. The stock of new japonica rice in the river was particularly abundant, and people were most hesitant. High-quality goods were still in demand towards Tianjin, with a price slightly up by 0.2 taels, opening at 16.5 yuan. Ordinary rice was difficult to sell, requiring a discount of about 0.3 taels. The market was extremely depressed. Sales of Bo rice turned sluggish, with quiet buying interest. The market was stable with a soft undertone. The arrival of Yangxian rice was brisk, but retailers were all observing, with prices slightly down by 0.2-0.3 taels, the top-quality goods at 12.5 yuan. Du Jian rice showed a slight decline, with transactions gradually decreasing and a small drop of about 0.15 taels in the overall market. Shanghai rice was still actively sold in small quantities, with prices holding steady. The arrival of top-quality rice was well-received, but sales were mediocre, falling by about 0.2 taels, with the top-quality goods opening at 10.05 yuan. Sales of Baiyuan rice were also sluggish, with the market also down by a small 0.1-0.2 taels. Overall, the entire white rice market is feared to have another sharp decline, mainly due to the arrival of Japanese rice in Shanghai, causing overall market weakness.</p>
<p>▲ South Shanghai: More than 20 boats arrived at the river. Sales on this street were extremely slow. Changbang new japonica rice was therefore rarely offered, so it has been fixed. The top-quality goods opened at 16.45 yuan. Su Tongbang japonica rice also showed no significant gains or losses, with a flat situation. Sales of Nanbang various kiln-type white rice were uniformly sluggish, with prices slightly down by nearly 0.1 taels. The market for Yangxian and Du Jian rice was also stable.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Collapses Drastically</h3>
<p>▲ Purely Affected by Foreign Markets</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw a uniform sharp decline in all months after opening in the morning and afternoon, especially the current month. The origin of this decline is still driven by foreign markets. It was initially reported that Manchurian wheat could be ordered at 4.75 qian per tael. Yesterday, it was widely rumored that a telegram of 4.55 qian per tael had been received, and it was said that a major factory had already placed an order. The more frantic decline in the current month was reportedly due to the multi-position of the previous month's warehouse receipts being returned, and the current month will still be delivered to the exchange. As a result, market sentiment for near and distant months was greatly shaken. The dumping by major manufacturers was also extremely active, with the total transaction volume reaching 1.5 million bags. Market conditions were all in sharp decline. As the news from abroad remains unfavorable, there may still be problems. As a result, the current month fell by a massive 0.55 yuan, November fell by 0.425 yuan, December fell by 0.4 yuan, January fell by 0.425 yuan, February fell by 0.45 yuan, and March fell by 0.4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Declines Sharply</h3>
<p>▲ Collapsing Flour Market... Cheap Foreign Wheat</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market was initially stable in the morning session due to favorable reports of foreign wheat, rising by 0.3-0.4 yuan, but market sentiment weakened due to the sluggish flour market. By the afternoon session, due to the collapse of the flour market and the offer of spot wheat from abroad, the weak market sentiment was also shaken. There was a surge in selling, and market prices plummeted. The prices for distant months were almost the same as during the new wheat season. The intensity of the decline was evident. As a result, the current month fell by 0.1 yuan, November and December fell by 0.07 yuan, January fell by 0.05 yuan, February fell by 0.04 yuan, and March fell by 0.03 yuan. Spot wheat was only quoted unopened because factories uniformly rejected it.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Yokohama Sugar Opens at 50,000 Bags</h3>
<p>▲ New York Sugar Rises Sharply by About 0.1 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw telegrams from production areas: The price of spot Cuban sugar was 1.3125, slightly up by 0.00625 from the previous telegram. The price of New York sugar futures for December was 1.32, for March next year was 1.42, for May was 1.49, all up sharply by 0.09 yuan. The price for September was 1.63, up by 0.1 yuan. The price of spot Java sugar was 8.1875, the price of sugar futures for October was 8.125, for November was 8.00, for December was 7.875, still with no gains or losses compared to the previous ones. The association's market was divided. The buying interest in Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was still scarce, with the new goods quoted at 7.95 taels, and No. 20 medium granulated white sugar at 7.1 taels, with few inquiries. The market was particularly weak. No. 18 Dutch red sugar was traded slightly at 6.45 taels, with a slight increase in the market. Japanese sugar factory prices continued to open, and the market was even weaker, with few transactions. N Mark 7.85 taels, YT Mark 7.775 taels, YP Mark 8 taels, with little demand. Meiji Sugar opened for delivery of 30,000 bags in November and December, with the price still at 4.5 yen per day in gold. Minghua Sugar opened for delivery of 20,000 bags in December, with the price at 5.7 yen per day in gold. The shipping agent's intention to import was very strong, and the opening was announced. Selling cargo Dutch sugar: Bingchang sold 1,000 bags of Kailu goods coarse granulated white sugar, priced at 6.8 taels exchanged. Tianxiang Foreign Firm sold 1,500 bags of ready-to-load No. 8 Dutch red sugar, priced at 4.8 Dutch guilders, all new regulations plus tax, and the market sentiment was still firm.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Goods: Longan Meat Market Price Turns Upward</h3>
<p>Hainan longan meat previously fell to about 26 taels due to the surge in arrivals. Seeing that the market price had reached the bottom, various groups purchased one after another, and the price turned upward. In addition, the quoted price also increased by 2 taels, and the trend became firm. Yesterday, dry and glossy packaged goods had to be sold at 28 taels, slightly less for the second grade, and others such as raw sun-dried meat had to be sold at 42-43 taels. Xiamen goods also increased by half a tael, sold at 31 taels.</p>
<h3>Silk Flowers, Chinese Silk, European Sales Still Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market at foreign firms in this port still had no turnaround. Overseas silk weaving factories are seeing a daily decrease in sales and still have thick silk reserves, which are sufficient to meet demand. Coupled with the abundance of Japanese silk, Chinese silk still has little appetite. Yesterday, only Xinfu imported 10 packages of Shanghai white factory silk, and Taihe and others imported 15 packages of white Qianjing silk, with prices all firm.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories Sharply Reduce Production</h3>
<p>▲ French Sales Slightly Increase: Prices Rise by 2-3 Taels</p>
<p>Silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have suffered huge losses due to sluggish silk sales, and many have announced closures. More than two-thirds of the silk factories in the two provinces have stopped work. Silk factory production is sharply reduced, and the market atmosphere has turned firm. Yesterday, the French firm Xinfu imported 20 dan of Wuxi silk factory silk, priced at 148 taels, up 2-3 taels.</p>
<h3>Russian Firms Open for Suian Zhenmei</h3>
<p>Since the launch of new tea in the tea market of foreign firms in this port, the sales of mid-grade Zhenmei from Suian, Shexian and other places have been consistently sluggish, causing the tea price to drop to 40-50 taels. The loss suffered by Chinese tea is no less than 60 taels per dan. Yesterday, the Russian Firm Assistance Association, in view of the favorable price of Suian Zhenmei tea, has already started its operations. Many British firms have also heard the news and purchased it, and the Zhenmei market may have a trend of activity. However, although the Russian firm has a very wide sales scope, it is uniquely harsh in its recognition of prices. Although there were many negotiations on Qimei black tea and Gongxi green tea in the past, transactions were still deserted due to the excessively high price demanded by the firm.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: East Piece Goods Trend Upward Again</h3>
<p>▲ This Factory's Cotton Cloth: The market was quite active yesterday. Merchants from the north, such as Tianjin, Niuzhuang, and Dalian, all made purchases, with coarse cloth being the main item. Hubei Tianzi Xing has almost been completely collected. Lu Zi also left the customs yesterday for 8.0 taels, and more than 200 pieces of 15.5-pound San Yuan Bao were sold, priced at 6.85 taels. Wholesale demand in this street from inland was also brisk. Yang He fine twill is still in short supply. Yesterday, inland merchants imported 50 pieces, priced at 7.35 taels. White flannel showed a slight decline, probably due to the influx of arrivals. Hou Sheng's Jin Yu Yun Shi both fell by 0.05 yuan. The price of 16-pound Shuang Yu Ji Qing and 15-pound Dian Che remained unchanged because of the strong demand on this street. Fine cloth remains soft.</p>
<p>▲ East and West Piece Goods: The market yesterday was harder with East goods, probably because the weather turned cold and inland merchants flocked to Shanghai to purchase goods. Yue Hua velvet all rose by 0.025 yuan, fine serge rose by 0.05 yuan, and Huiwen serge was almost out of stock. Lie Yan miscellaneous colors sold out at 0.255 yuan. Zhigong cloth also rose by 0.025 yuan, and Shuang Tong Lu also needed 0.2925 yuan. Lie Yan was 0.325 yuan until yesterday, but printed velvet fell all the time, probably because arrivals were continuously.</p>
<h3>Hardware: A Large Batch of East Iron Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>East white iron has had very few arrivals recently, resulting in particularly high purchases from various groups. There is a trend that the market goods are not continuing, so the standards are rising steadily. Currently, 3'7" is sold for 1 tael 1 qian 3 fen, and 3'6" is sold for 9 qian 1.5 fen. Yesterday, it was reported that Osaka Wharf and Mitsubishi Company's Huishan Wharf in Pudong had more than 10,000 sheets arriving, which are being declared, so there is no worry that the market goods will be cut off.</p>

<p>▲And to Participate in President Tan's State Funeral</p>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun, after returning to Shanghai the day before yesterday, hosted a banquet for his colleagues at the Municipal Government Club on Weihaiwei Road that evening. He went to the Municipal Government as usual yesterday morning to attend to official duties. At 11 o'clock last night, Mr. Zhang, accompanied by Fang Benren, took the night train to Nanjing. According to an interview with Mr. Zhang by this newspaper's reporter, he made the hurried trip to Nanjing specifically to attend President Tan's state funeral and to report everything to Chairman Chiang. He will return to Shanghai in a few days.</p>
<h3>Xu Peihuang, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, is Acting Director</h3>
<p>▲The Municipal Government Issued an Order Yesterday</p>
<p>▲Mr. Xu Will Take Office Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government has appointed Xu Peihuang, a counselor of the Municipal Government, as acting director of the Municipal Education Bureau, because Chen Dezheng, the director of the Municipal Education Bureau, has been detained in Nanjing and has not been released. Education cannot be without a leader for a single day. During Mr. Chen's leave of absence, he will be responsible for presiding over everything. It is reported that Mr. Xu will go to the bureau to take office today after being appointed.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Denies Increasing Water Rates</h3>
<p>▲Returning the Water Bills from the Water Company</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Public Concession Water Company yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern, we have received your company's water bill for September. According to the bill, our association used 67 gallons of water this month. Calculated at 5 jiao per gallon, we should only pay 33.5 yuan. However, your company's bill lists 41.9 yuan, which has already included a 25% increase based on the current price. The issue of your company increasing water rates has been repeatedly raised by citizens. The detailed situation is well known to your company and need not be repeated. Before this case is properly resolved, our association cannot pay the 25% surcharge. We are returning the original bill with this letter for your consideration."</p>
<h3>The Real Estate Association Opposes Increasing Water Prices Before the Audit</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association in the Concession yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern, we have learned that the Shanghai Water Company has not submitted the profit and loss statement and balance sheet for the first half of this year to the representatives of your association for auditing. As a result, a report could not be prepared to determine whether an increase should be made. The blame lies with the Shanghai Water Company. Now, the company is not following your association's proposal that water prices should be charged at 6% until the audit is completed. Instead, it is calculating all water bills at 6% plus a quarter. This is disregard for public opinion and contempt for your association. We are concerned that such actions by the company may easily cause serious disputes. We are writing to your association to quickly send a letter to the company to follow your association's proposal to avoid causing serious disputes."</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai Real Estate Association issued a notice yesterday, stating: "Notice is hereby given that the Shanghai Water Company has arbitrarily increased water prices by 25%. Our association has requested the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association to actively negotiate for cancellation. The company, knowing the will of the people, has voluntarily requested the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association and our association to send representatives to audit the company's accounts. Therefore, before the audit is completed and it is deemed that an increase should be made, all water prices should, according to legal theory, still be calculated at 6%. We will wait for a resolution. The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association, in view of this, has already sent a letter to the company to handle the matter accordingly. However, the company has not paid attention to the above situation. On the one hand, it has not quickly submitted the profit and loss statement and balance sheet for the first six months of this year for review. On the other hand, it has added a quarter to all water bills based on the original price of 6%. Such disregard for legal principles is beyond our association's expectations. Therefore, we hereby notify that all water bills must be paid according to the previous letter from the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association, at the original price of 6%, before the audit is completed and it is deemed that an increase should be made. This is hereby announced. October 15, 1930."</p>
<h3>Japanese Vice Minister Nagai to Go to Nanjing This Morning</h3>
<p>▲Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Cancels Accompanying Trip</p>
<p>According to news from the Japanese Embassy Office yesterday, Vice Minister Nagai has confirmed that he will take the Shanghai-Nanjing train to Nanjing at 9:00 AM today (16th) to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. It was originally scheduled that Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu Aoi would accompany him to Nanjing to introduce him, but because Mr. Shigemitsu has other important matters, he did not depart for Nanjing last night and may still find it difficult to leave Shanghai today. Therefore, it has been changed to have the second secretary of the Japanese Embassy, ​​Hayashide, accompany him. Shigemitsu plans to postpone his trip to Nanjing for a few days. Vice Minister Nagai is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Nanjing on the Nanyo Maru on the 22nd of this month, stay in Shanghai for two days, and then take the Dalian Maru to Qingdao on the 25th to inspect the north.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Bankers' Association Host Banquet for Japanese Vice Minister</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Bankers' Association hosted a public banquet for Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Nagai Ryutaro at the Shanghai Bankers' Club yesterday afternoon. Those present included Shigemitsu, Fukushima, Funatsu, Ikeda, Hayashide, Milli, Miura, Yu Qiaqing, Zhao Jinqing, Ye Huijun, Xu Xinliu, Wang Yansong, Wu Yunzhai, Di Chuqing, Wang Yiting, Chen Guangfu, and more than 30 others. Wang Xiaolai and Hu Mengjia presided over the meeting. Both hosts and guests gave speeches. Excerpts are as follows: (1) Chairman's speech: "We are honored to have Mr. Nagai, in his busy schedule, grace us with his presence today, allowing us to discuss with a prominent foreign statesman. I have been in the business community for many years and have had no time to study politics, law, and diplomacy. I am ashamed to be an outsider. Therefore, I dare not presumptuously speculate on Mr. Nagai's foreign policy views, and I dare not pretend to introduce matters relating to politics and diplomacy. However, I have indirectly known his goodwill towards our country from the reputation of students studying in Japan and the changes in the national sentiment towards Japan. This is why I want to take this opportunity today to briefly express my admiration. Among the students from our country studying in Japan, those studying at Waseda University were the earliest and the most numerous, and Mr. Nagai was the pioneer of the Waseda school. Those of our country's students who returned home all spoke glowingly of Mr. Nagai's virtue. This is how I indirectly learned of Mr. Nagai's goodwill from the reputation of the students. According to my memory, Mr. Nagai's current position as Vice Minister seems to be his third time. Each time the news of his appointment came, it evoked goodwill from the people of our country. This is another way I indirectly learned of Mr. Nagai's goodwill from the changes in the national sentiment towards Japan. From the above two points, Mr. Nagai's usual attitude towards China can be inferred. Yesterday I read in the newspapers that Mr. Nagai, in his first remarks after arriving in Shanghai, believed that our country is on the path to recovery, and that the important issue in the future lies in how to establish economic policies. This is indeed a statement that insightfully reflects the current situation of our country, and it is one that those of us who serve in the economic community have heard and admired. I believe that the current world economic situation has revealed domestic and international dangers. The focus of recent domestic and foreign policy issues in various countries seems to be nothing more than seeking to avoid economic crises. East Asia, with its relatively weak economic foundation, especially feels the threat of the world economy. Japan is an industrialized country and relies on sales for its products. China is a country that needs goods. If China's economy is poor, it will greatly affect exporters and cause harm. How to reorganize the domestic economy and establish the East Asian economy in the future seems to be something that China and Japan should work together to achieve. I think Mr. Nagai will also say the same. I have heard friends say that Mr. Nagai has always held the belief of 'more than friendship' regarding Sino-Japanese relations, meaning that passively seeking friendship is not enough to fulfill the responsibilities of the two countries. It is necessary to actively take a step further in mutual assistance in diplomacy and economy in order for East Asia to be able to compete with Europe and the United States. This is indeed a profound statement, and we cannot help but agree. Taking advantage of this happy gathering today, I would like to fill my glass and wish Mr. Nagai success on this trip, to achieve 'more than friendship' and achieve the effect of interdependent relations." (2) Nagai's reply: "I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the banquet hosted by the leaders of the business community today. Shanghai is China's first commercial port and an important commercial port in the world. The prosperity or decline of Shanghai's commerce is also the prosperity or decline of Japan's commerce. This is not just words, it can be confirmed by trade figures. The trade relationship between China and Japan has become increasingly close in recent years. Before the European War, Japan's trade with China accounted for only 20% of China's total foreign trade. Now it has increased to 30%. Also, Shanghai's trade with Japan has increased from 15% to 20%. This shows that the prosperity of Shanghai's commerce is a glory for China, and Japan is also indirectly benefiting from it. Chairman Wang mentioned the economic union of East Asia just now, and I deeply admire it. Looking at the various countries in Europe, despite differences in culture, religion, and race, there have recently been proposals for a European economic union. Moreover, China and Japan have the same race, the same culture, and the same religion. Although politically divided into two countries, the need for economic cooperation is urgent. I am tall, so Europeans often mistake me for a Chinese, and even Chinese people mistake me for a compatriot. This alone is enough to prove that the people of China and Japan cannot be separated. Some contemporary people have said that human competition has progressed from along the river to along the coast, and even from along the coast to competing for the sun. Now we have reached the stage of competing for the sun. Therefore, as the world's perspective shifts from the Atlantic to the Pacific, China and Japan, the two major countries located in the Pacific, should earnestly seek economic unity in this critical period to cope with the situation. I hope that this goal can be achieved through the efforts of the leaders of the business community present today."</p>
<h3>Japanese Rice Arrives in Shanghai But Not Unloaded</h3>
<p>▲Customs Prohibits Unloading</p>
<p>Japanese rice was shipped to Shanghai on the Waka Maru, chartered by Mitsui &amp; Co. from the Toda Company of Kobe, carrying 18,300 bags of rice. It entered the port at 7:00 AM yesterday. At 8:40 AM, it docked at the Mitsui Wharf in Pudong. At that time, it was intended to be unloaded, because 5,100 bags of the rice had already been sold to Chinese merchants at a price of 10 yuan per stone. Yesterday afternoon, another Chinese merchant signed a contract with Mitsui &amp; Co. to purchase 3,000 bags, but the Jianghai Customs prohibited unloading, so the ship had to temporarily drop anchor at the wharf and has not yet opened its hatches to unload. It is reported that the Japanese merchants are negotiating to unload the rice.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Removal of Cross-Border Telephones</h3>
<p>▲Ministry of Communications Sends Materials to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Wang Boqun, Minister of Communications, believed that the Shanghai Concession Telephone Bureau's installation of telephones across the border was a blatant disregard for national sovereignty. Therefore, he specially dispatched Liu, a member of the ministry, to Shanghai to conduct a detailed investigation of the telephone numbers and numbers installed across the border. After three days, the task has been completely completed. Mr. Liu immediately drafted a report in Shanghai and returned to Nanjing the night before last to submit it to the ministry as a basis for negotiations. It was recently learned that the Ministry of Communications yesterday sent the findings of Mr. Liu's investigation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that negotiations be promptly initiated with the Shanghai Consular Corps and that the company be ordered to dismantle the telephones to protect national sovereignty and prevent future problems.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Shipping Merchants Seek to Recover the Right to Inspect Ships from Customs</h3>
<p>▲ Foreign Employees' Contracts Nearing Expiration</p>
<p>▲ Shipping Merchants Recommend Four Candidates</p>
<p>▲ Requesting the Customs Taipan to Hire Them</p>
<p>The right to inspect ships in Shanghai has long been held by foreigners. The ship inspectors employed by the Jianghai Customs have historically been Westerners. This reversal of power has caused deep suffering for Chinese shipping merchants. Every inspection involves excessive fault-finding. The shipping industry in this port has held numerous meetings regarding this matter, advocating for Chinese shipping merchants to reclaim the right to inspect ships and manage it themselves. This year, they have twice sent letters to the Customs Taipan, requesting that Chinese vessels be inspected by ship inspectors hired by the companies themselves, with annual inspections stipulated. However, the customs office has rejected these requests, preventing the matter from achieving its desired outcome. The Jianghai Customs' excuse was that the contracts of the foreign ship inspectors had not yet expired, making it difficult to comply. Now, Shanghai shipping merchants have learned that the contracts of the foreign ship inspectors employed by the customs office are about to expire this year. The shipping merchants believe this is a rare opportunity and should seize this moment to request the Jianghai Customs to employ Chinese personnel as customs ship inspectors. This matter has already been brought up in a general meeting of Chinese shipping companies. The result of the discussion was unanimous agreement to recommend ship inspector personnel in the name of all Shanghai shipping merchants, requesting the Customs Taipan to hire them. However, for the sake of the seriousness of the position, great attention has been paid to the selection of candidates. Members of the Shanghai Shipping Association have publicly recommended Liu Fubei, Huang Shaosan, Li Yuncheng, and Wang Guisun, each with resumes in both Chinese and Western languages. The Shipping Association will attach these resumes and send a letter to the Jianghai Customs Taipan, requesting their employment as customs ship inspectors. The Shanghai shipping industry is determined to achieve this goal. They will wait for the Taipan's response before taking the next step in their demands.</p>
<h3>Proclamation Regarding the Opening of Weihaiwei as a Commercial Port</h3>
<p>▲ Under the Jurisdiction of the Donghai Customs</p>
<p>Proclamation No. 1198 issued by Mei Weixing, Customs Taipan of the Jianghai Customs: Proclamation regarding the matter that Weihaiwei has now been opened as a commercial port and a sub-customs office has been established under the jurisdiction of the Donghai Customs. Operations will commence from October 9th of this year. All goods entering or leaving the port must be handled in accordance with customs regulations. Let all merchants be aware. This proclamation is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>Population Census in the Public Concession</h3>
<p>▲ Based on the Night of October 22nd</p>
<p>The Public Concession's Municipal Council has customarily conducted a census of the population within the concession every five years. This year marks the expiration of that term, and a new census must be conducted. The Council Chairman has decided to implement the census starting on the 21st of this month and ending on the 22nd. The standard will be the actual number of residents residing on the night of the 22nd. All census procedures have been agreed upon by the Tax and Police Departments, who will jointly handle the census forms. These forms will be distributed on the 21st and 22nd, and collected by personnel from the Tax Department on the 23rd. This census will be conducted for all Chinese and foreign residents within the concession, with particular emphasis on Chinese citizens.</p>
<h3>Recent Survey of the River Defense Deployment</h3>
<p>The naval authorities, due to the unpredictable movements of bandits and communists in the upper reaches of the river, have made the river defense deployment even more rigorous. For example, the Xianning and Shunshun warships are alternately stationed in and around Changsha. The Jiangzhen and Desheng warships are stationed in Yuezhou and Chenglingji respectively. The Cheng Sheng warship is stationed in Xindi, and the Yong Sheng warship is patrolling between Hankou and Changsha. The Chu Guan and Chu Qian warships are both stationed in Wuhan. If they can contain the flames of banditry along the Xiang and E rivers, the local areas can be stabilized. At the same time, the Lian Jing and Jian Kang warships have departed from Beijing and are heading to Anqing and Wuhu, so that the defense of the Anhui River is also secure. The Chu Tai warship, originally stationed in Wuxue, has also been ordered to move its defense to Jiujiang, joining the Jiang Yuan (patrolling near Hukou), Jiang Kun (originally stationed in Jiujiang), and Jiang Xi (originally stationed in Wucheng) warships in taking responsibility for the Gan defense. Under this rigorous deployment, the river defenses along the Xiang, E, Wan, and Gan rivers have been strengthened. In addition, those stationed on the river surface near the capital are currently the Hai Chou, Chu You, Wu Sheng, Hu E, and Ying warships and boats, all taking responsibility for safeguarding the capital.</p>
<h3>Japanese View on Sino-Japanese Shipping</h3>
<p>▲ Nippon Yusen's Business Sluggish: The business of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) in this port on the Sino-Japanese route this year has been affected by the soaring gold prices and the current situation, and both imports and exports are not as good as last year. The cargo volume for the nine months totaled 215,400 tons, a decrease of 34,950 tons compared to the same period last year. And the freight revenue this year is expected to decrease by 166,700 yuan compared to the same period last year. Among them, only the export of rapeseed, 450,000 bags were shipped in the nine months of last year, while only over 150,000 bags were shipped this year.</p>
<p>▲ Kawasaki Increases Sailings to Northern Ports: Since the Japanese company Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha opened the Shanghai-Tianjin route, it has only operated with one ship, the "Kawa Maru". Recently, since the double tax in Tianjin was abolished, large quantities of Shanghai cotton yarn have been shipped there, and grain and wheat flour have also been de-banned. The company, due to poor business on the Sino-Japanese route, has moved its tonnage to expand to the northern ports of China. Starting today, it has decided to increase the Shanghai-Tianjin route from one to four ships. First, the "Tosho Maru" (3,000 tons) will be added, and a telegram has been sent to the Japanese head office requesting the dispatch of two more ships of 2,000 to 3,000 tons each to Shanghai in late this month to increase sailings on the Shanghai-Tianjin route.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Marine Products Shipped to Shanghai: Hokkaido, Japan, is very rich in marine products, and most of them are sold to China. Since the agricultural inspection offices in Shantou and Xiamen have been inspecting imported goods, fresh fruits and marine products, many Japanese products have been found to contain pests and have been banned from landing. Japanese marine products have changed their transportation destination and are now being repackaged and shipped to Shanghai. The Nippon Yusen Kaisha in this port has specially undertaken the shipment of Hokkaido marine products to Shanghai and has opened a new route called the "Shanghai-Nemuro Line". The "Chikuzen Maru" and "Chikugo Maru" have been assigned to sail between Nemuro, Mutsu, Akkeshi, Hakodate and Shanghai, specializing in the shipment of marine products to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News from the Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>▲ Xin Feng Released: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Xin Feng" ship was detained when it arrived at the Dagu port on its way from Shanghai to Tianjin, because Tianjin customs officials found 110 pieces of smuggled goods in the ship, attempting to evade import duties. Later, the customs and the shipowner investigated and found the person who smuggled the goods. As a result, the customs fined the person 270 silver dollars for tax evasion. Yesterday, a telegram was sent to Shanghai saying that the fine had been paid and the ship had been released and is currently</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>unloading goods.</p>
<p>▲ Beijing Delayed: The Taikoo Company's "New Beijing" ship was originally scheduled to sail to Ningbo yesterday, but because the bottom of the ship was damaged, the company temporarily cancelled the sailing for the sake of safe navigation. Technicians and divers were sent into the water to inspect the bottom of the ship. After inspection, it was found that the bottom of the ship had slight damage. Repairs have been arranged, and it is expected to sail as usual tomorrow. Yesterday, the "Ning Shao" ship went to Ningbo, and passengers who were originally scheduled to take the "Beijing" ship all switched to the "Ning Shao", so the ship was very crowded with passengers and cargo.</p>
<p>▲ Emei Released: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Emei" ship, which was detained by the Sichuan army in Chongqing and used to transport troops to Yichang, has been released after the Shanghai office telegraphed Liu Xiang to order its release. Yesterday, the office received a telegram from Yichang stating that the "Emei" ship had been released and has now sailed downstream to load commercial goods.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories' Continued Representative Conference</h3>
<p>▲ Agreed on Methods for Sharing Public Debt</p>
<p>Silk factory operators in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, due to the sluggish silk market and the near-total depletion of their funds, have been unable to sustain operations and have announced closures one after another, facing imminent bankruptcy. They have publicly deliberated and petitioned the government to issue 10 million yuan in public bonds for the silk industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai to provide relief. Representatives have been dispatched to Shanghai to organize a relief committee, comprising the fifteen appointed representatives as committee members responsible for specifically requesting the government to issue public bonds and handle matters such as sharing the burden. They have already convened the first representative conference, where matters such as the amount of bonds to be issued and the names of the bonds have been agreed upon. At 3 PM on the 14th (the day before yesterday), the second representative conference was held. Attendees included Shen Huachen, Huang Jinchen, Wang Xiaolai, Zhu Jing'an, Huang Jinfan, Wu Shenbo, Zhang Yunsheng, Cheng Bingruo, Qian Fenghao, Zhang Zizhen, Yang Yuchu (Xue Shouxuan returned to Wuxi beforehand), Zhu Mouxian, Jiang Lanxian, Li Youren, and fourteen others. Shen Huachen was publicly elected as the chairman, and after performing the customary formalities, the representatives continued to discuss important issues such as how the industry would share the burden of the public bonds after they were issued. Chairman Shen and others first reported the number of silk reeling machines in each region: Shanghai city has 98 single-reeling silk factories with approximately 26,000 machines in total, 8 double-reeling silk factories with 1,449 machines (Jardine Matheson with 520 machines, Nisshin with over 300 machines - these are excluded because they are foreign-owned), approximately 1,000 machines in Zhenjiang and Suzhou combined, 48 silk factories in Wuxi with approximately 14,000 machines, approximately 1,200 machines in Wujiang County, 23 silk factories in Zhejiang province with approximately 6,000 machines. In total, Jiangsu and Zhejiang have approximately 49,000 silk reeling machines. Assuming each machine is assigned 200 yuan of public debt, it totals 10 million yuan in national currency, to be repaid in installments over five years, approximately 60 months or 58 months. Following the precedent of the 600,000 yuan cash loan in 1914 and the 1 million yuan in 1918, the customs office will collect 20 taels of silver per bale of silk exported to repay the loan in installments. It was decided that the bond regulations should be modeled after the customs duty treasury bills. The representatives discussed in detail whether factories that had already declared bankruptcy, or were intermittently open and closed, or had been taken over or renamed should also bear the burden of the debt, and how to extract funds if a factory ceased operations midway after receiving funds and had no silk exports. The meeting adjourned at around 9 PM. The representatives from Wuxi (four people) and Zhejiang (three people) separately took trains back to their respective regions yesterday (the 15th) to report the proceedings of the conference and the implementation methods to their colleagues, and will return to Shanghai to attend the third conference on the 22nd of this month (next Wednesday).</p>
<h3>The Red Cross Submits Various Rules and Regulations to the National Government for Record</h3>
<p>The third Provisional Membership Conference of the Chinese Red Cross Society resolved to establish a committee to revise the constitution and various rules and regulations. All articles of the Chinese Red Cross Society, including the constitution, election law, branch rules, and executive committee regulations, have been passed by the constitution revision committee after three readings and submitted to the Standing Council for review. This has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Standing Council of the Society has resolved that the Chinese Red Cross Society is an international charitable organization that is directly subordinate to the central government, unlike local charitable organizations. Therefore, it should draft a formal report detailing its organizational history and development, and submit it directly to the National Government for record, along with all its rules and regulations. It should also send a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau for review. The Society's report to the National Government and its letter to the Health Bureau have been obtained and are published below.</p>
<p>▲ Report to the National Government: Report for submitting the Chinese Red Cross Society's constitution, election law, branch rules, and executive committee regulations for review and record. Regarding the matter of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's letter stating that it had received four measures from the Shanghai Municipal Government for resolving the aftermath of the Chinese Red Cross Society's disputes, which had been approved by your office. The Society considered that its existing constitution was no longer applicable or complete. The third Provisional Membership Conference resolved to establish a constitution revision committee to make detailed revisions, and appointed Wen Lanting, Hong Yanbin, Ye Zhisheng, Wu Jiasan, Dong Xinqin, Zhou Guangjiu, Xu Xichun, Xue Shaoting, Jiang Daqiu, Yang Ke, and Li Zhenbang as members, and invited members of the Society's Executive Committee to attend the meetings. The constitution revision committee was established on August 20, with Wen Lanting as chairman. The progress was reported to the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, which forwarded it to the Shanghai Municipal Government and then to your government for approval. The Society is an international charitable organization directly subordinate to the central government. It was established in the 30th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, the Russo-Japanese War was ongoing, and the war had spread to the three northeastern provinces. The foreign nationals residing in Manchuria were aware that they were in a dangerous situation and were eager to escape. At that time, China had not yet joined the International Red Cross League and had no right to enjoy wartime relief and medical aid. People in Shanghai, out of compassion, were willing to donate money to help them escape. Shen Dunhe consulted with various consuls and established the Red Cross Society in Shanghai in conjunction with the neutral countries of Britain, the United States, Germany, and France, naming it the "Provisional Simple Regulations of the Shanghai International Red Cross Society," consisting of eight articles. In the 32nd year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, Zhang Deyi, the Qing government's envoy to Britain, went to Switzerland to join the alliance and signed the Geneva Red Cross Treaty on July 6. In the 33rd year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, Lü Haihuan, Sheng Xuanhuai, and Wu Chongxi reported the establishment and management of the Red Cross Society in Shanghai and the matters of long-term sustainability to the government for record. The name was then changed to the "Great Qing Red Cross Society," and an official seal was issued. Lü Haihuan was appointed as president. In the first year of the Xuantong reign of the Qing Dynasty, President Lü Haihuan finalized the affairs of the Shanghai International Red Cross Society and drafted six articles of trial regulations, which were reported to the government for record. In the second year of the Xuantong reign of the Qing Dynasty, Sheng Xuanhuai was reappointed as president. In the third year of the Xuantong reign of the Qing Dynasty, Lü Haihuan was reappointed as president, and Shen Dunhe and Fukason were appointed as the directors-general, organizing an International Board of Directors in Shanghai. Shen Dunhe and the British Assessor Su Fengli were publicly elected as directors-general, and Shi Zejing and Ren Fengxin were appointed as leading directors. Shen Dunhe also served as the chairman of the board of directors. At that time, the Xinhai Revolution broke out, and the Wuchang Uprising occurred. President Lü Haihuan and Chairman of the Board of Directors Shen Dunhe and Fukason jointly handled relief matters, and the current name "Chinese Red Cross Society" was adopted. A general meeting was held to raise donations and organize medical teams to rush to the battlefields, establishing temporary hospitals in Hankou, Wuchang, and Hanyang to rescue the wounded and disabled. The Board of Directors then resolved to establish honorary members, special members, and regular members. During that campaign, the Society's rescue, medical aid, and burial efforts were remarkable. In the first year of the Republic of China, Ariga Nagao, a special envoy of the Japanese Red Cross Society, visited Shanghai under the introduction of Yoshiaki Arika, the Japanese consul in Shanghai. He was deeply impressed by the achievements. Vice-President Shen Dunhe and Ariga Nagao and Japanese doctors repeatedly discussed and formulated the Society's constitution consisting of six chapters and thirty articles, referring to the precedents of various countries in the East and West. As a result, the scale gradually took shape and the foundation gradually solidified. Marquis Matsukata, the president of the Japanese Red Cross Society, especially introduced the Society to the International Federation in Switzerland. President Ador of the International Federation cabled his approval for its accession. Xu Shichang, the former President of the Republic of China, also approved the registration at the request of the former Vice-President Li Yuanhong. Former Vice-President Li and military commanders sent telegrams of commendation, promising to protect the Society. After the unification of the North and South, the former President Yuan Shikai sent a telegram promising protection and urging the Society to proceed. Thus, it became the official Chinese Red Cross Society. On September 29, the first membership conference was held, and the constitution consisting of six chapters and twenty articles was passed. Zhu Peizhen, Shi Zejing, and thirty-two others were publicly elected as standing councilors. On October 6, the Standing Council was established, and the President and Vice-President of the Republic of China were publicly elected as honorary presidents, Lü Haihuan as the president, and Shen Dunhe as the vice-president and chairman of the Standing Council. A public telegram was sent to the government requesting a formal announcement. On October 19, the government approved the request. Since the Wuchang Uprising, whenever there was a war zone, the Society established hospitals to provide medical treatment and bury the dead. However, these were all established hastily. Although the principles were the same, the procedures differed. There were also cases where branches were established in the name of the Society without prior consultation. Therefore, the Society specially convened a unified conference on October 30, with the aim of unifying and consolidating the foundation. In advance, representatives were invited from all branches, and telegrams were sent to the government, former Vice-President Li, and the governors of various provinces, requesting them to send representatives to Shanghai to express their opinions and facilitate the process. On that day, in addition to the various branches, representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of the Navy, and Ministry of the Army, as well as former Vice-President Li, Governor Zhao of Fengtian, and Governor Cheng of Jiangsu, were present. Telegrams of congratulation were also received from former Vice-President Li, the Prime Minister, and civil and military officials from various regions, making it a grand event. On June 25, 1922, the Society held its second membership conference and passed the revised constitution of the Red Cross Society. The meeting continued on the 29th, electing Zhuang Lu, Yang Sheng, Wang Zhen, and forty-five others as standing councilors, and drafting the branch rules consisting of twenty-eight articles, which were passed by the Standing Council and implemented. On July 6, the first Standing Council meeting was held, and Wang Zhen and Sheng Bingji were mutually elected as the president and vice-president, and Zhuang Lu as the chairman of the board of directors. On the 8th, the second Standing Council meeting was held, and Wang Daxie was elected as the president, Cai Tinggan as the vice-president stationed in Beijing, and Yang Sheng as the vice-president stationed in Shanghai. A telegram was sent to the government requesting their appointment. On August 17, a reply was received approving the request. On March 23, 1924, the Society held its 63rd Standing Council meeting. As the terms of the president and vice-presidents had expired, a vote was held to elect replacements. Yan Huiqing was elected as the president, Cai Tinggan as the vice-president stationed in Beijing, and Yang Sheng as the vice-president stationed in Shanghai. A telegram was sent to the government requesting their appointment, which was approved on April 29. On September 21, 1928, the Society held its 75th Standing Council meeting. It was publicly agreed that as Minister of the Interior Xue had repeatedly sent letters urging the re-election of the president and vice-presidents, and as the current president Yan Huiqing and vice-presidents Cai Tinggan and Yang Sheng had also telegraphed their resignations due to the unification of the North and South, a re-election should be held immediately. Yan Huiqing was elected as the president, Wang Zhengting as the vice-president stationed in Beijing, and Yu Hede as the vice-president stationed in Shanghai. It was decided that in the past, re-elections were telegraphed to the President for appointment, but as the National Government had changed to a committee system, a letter should be sent directly to the Ministry of the Interior requesting appointment. A public letter from the Ministry of the Interior (No. 286) stated: "According to the order of the Executive Yuan, the National Government's instruction No. 468 states that the Ministry of the Interior's report requesting the appointment of the president of the Chinese Red Cross Society and the filing of the revised constitution for record is approved. The president and vice-presidents have been elected by vote and do not need to be appointed by this government. The submitted constitution has been reviewed and is deemed appropriate and approved for record. You are hereby notified and ordered to comply." This is the general outline of the Society's organizational history. The current constitution revision committee, considering that the Society is an international charitable organization directly subordinate to the central government and distinct from local charitable organizations, has compiled the constitution based on this principle. All articles of the Chinese Red Cross Society, including the constitution, election law, branch rules, and executive committee regulations, have been passed by the constitution revision committee after three readings and submitted to the 102nd Standing Council meeting for review. It was resolved that they should first be submitted to your government for approval and record, and then sent to all branches for review, in order to hold the fourth membership conference and conduct elections. Therefore, the reasons for revising the constitution, along with the Chinese Red Cross Society's constitution, election law, branch rules, and executive committee regulations, are submitted in writing, requesting your office to approve the record. We eagerly await your order. Respectfully submitted to Jiang, the Chairman of the National Government, Wang Zhen, the Chairman of the Standing Council of the Chinese Red Cross Society, Yan Huiqing, the President, Wang Zhengting, the Vice-President stationed in Beijing, and Yu Hede, the Vice-President stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲ Letter to the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau: To Director Hu of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau: We have received your bureau's letter forwarding the four measures for resolving the aftermath of the Chinese Red Cross Society's disputes, which have been submitted to the National Government for approval. We immediately submitted them to the third Provisional Membership Conference of our Society, which resolved to establish a constitution revision committee to revise the various articles of the constitution. We have reported the progress to your bureau for forwarding to the Shanghai Municipal Government and reporting to the National Government. Later, we received your bureau's letter of September 5 stating that it had received instructions from the Shanghai Municipal Government stating that the letter from the National Government's Civil Affairs Office had been received and forwarded. His Excellency the President instructed that the Society's constitution should be revised and submitted for review. All the articles of our Society, including the constitution, election law, branch rules, and executive committee regulations, have been passed by the constitution revision committee after three readings and submitted to the 102nd Standing Council meeting for review. It was publicly agreed to first submit them to the National Government for approval and record, and then send them to all branches for review, in order to hold the fourth membership conference and conduct elections. Therefore, we are sending a copy of the report, along with the Chinese Red Cross Society's constitution, election law, branch rules, and executive committee regulations, to your bureau for review. Respectfully, Wang Zhen, the Chairman of the Standing Council of the Chinese Red Cross Society, Yan Huiqing, the President, Wang Zhengting, the Vice-President, and Yu Hede, the Vice-President.</p>
<h3>Petition to the National Government by the Anti-Drug Association to Strictly Enforce Opium Prohibition</h3>
<p>During the opening of the Seventh National Anti-Drug Week on the first of this month, the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association held a joint meeting of representatives from all sectors at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. At that time, it was resolved to petition the National Government to abolish the special tax in Hunan and Hubei and strictly prohibit the cultivation of poppies, as reported previously. Yesterday, the association, based on the resolution of the general meeting, submitted a petition to the National Government. The text of the petition is recorded below: "Petition regarding the request to abolish the special tax in Hunan and Hubei and strictly prohibit the cultivation of poppies. Drinking poison to quench thirst is never a good plan. Moreover, opium, which harms the people and the country, will further damage the authority of the central government and compromise the international standing of the nation. The establishment of the special tax in Hunan and Hubei was originally intended as a temporary measure to clean up existing opium stores. However, it has been repeatedly extended with no end in sight. While the government only gains an additional 14 million yuan in revenue per year, corrupt merchants and officials embezzle no less than 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, leading to a pervasive atmosphere of poison and widespread disaster in the provinces along the Yangtze River. We respectfully enumerate and present the situation to Your Excellency's office. According to a survey by the Social Affairs Bureau of the Wuhan Municipal Government, there are a total of 13,017 businesses in Wuhan. Grain businesses account for only 536, while opium businesses account for 764. There are 62,721 employees in the city, with only 2,698 engaged in the grain business, while as many as 3,056 are engaged in the opium business. According to this analysis, the number of opium merchants in Wuhan is actually greater than that of grain businesses. How can it be that the rice industry, which is essential for the people's sustenance, is less prevalent than opium merchants, who contribute to the consumption of addictive poison? This scene is truly lamentable and unprecedented in the world. This is the first reason why the special tax in Hunan and Hubei should be abolished as soon as possible. According to the minutes of the 41st meeting of the Opium Prohibition Committee, Wei Renyi and 44 other merchants from Fengcheng County, Jiangxi Province, reported that special goods in Changsha were explicitly taxed and that they transported the goods according to orders, but were intercepted by the magistrate of Liuyang County in violation of orders. The Hunan Provincial Government responded by stating that since the intercepted opium was not transported along the designated route, it should be confiscated and destroyed. They requested that the Hunan Provincial Government be consulted to order the county to return the opium. Merchants transporting opium deserve severe punishment. How can the county magistrate's interception of opium be considered a violation of orders? Now, a lawsuit is being filed with the Central Opium Prohibition Committee, which is responsible for supervising opium prohibition, demanding the return of the opium. This is both illogical and illegal, and rarely seen in ancient or modern times. Furthermore, the authorities do not have unified laws and regulations. This interception and demand resembles child's play and is a laughingstock at home and abroad. This is most egregious. This is the second reason why the special tax in Hunan and Hubei should be abolished as soon as possible. The reason why the transplanting of poppies in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou has not been eradicated to this day is largely because of the collection of opium taxes, which allows for unimpeded passage through other provinces. If opium prohibition is implemented in Wuhan, a vital hub connecting North and South, it will not only reduce the production in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces and the flow of poison downstream along the Yangtze River, but also help to eradicate it in Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Jiangxi provinces. This is because Hunan and Guangdong provinces do not traditionally cultivate opium, and their soil is not suitable for it. If the source is cut off, opium prohibition will be easier to implement. Now, with the collection of the special tax, the unimpeded transportation of opium is causing deep harm, not only in the Yangtze River basin. This is the third reason why the special tax in Hunan and Hubei should be abolished as soon as possible. During the current collection of national opium prohibition achievements by this association, the reports from various county governments in Hubei Province state that their counties are 'collecting taxes under the guise of prohibition,' and that the 'opium prohibition bureaus' only collect opium taxes and do nothing else, making it impossible to fill out the reports. The central government has long issued clear orders to abolish all local opium prohibition agencies established before December 31st of the seventeenth year of the Republic; otherwise, it would be considered illegal. The practice of 'collecting taxes under the guise of prohibition' is a deceptive policy that the central government has also ordered to be abolished. Now, the special tax in Hunan and Hubei stands in the way, not only making opium prohibition impossible in Hunan and Hubei provinces, but also violating laws and regulations, disrupting administrative and judicial affairs, damaging the authority of the central government, and disappointing the public. This is the fourth reason why the special tax in Hunan and Hubei should be abolished as soon as possible. In summary, the four major points above clearly demonstrate that the special tax in Hunan and Hubei should be abolished as soon as possible. Honorable officials may have already considered this. As for the prohibition of poppy cultivation, the central government has repeatedly issued strict regulations, which the provinces initially took seriously. In recent years, however, it has seen a resurgence, with Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou returning to their old ways. Local troops compete to collect taxes, even more so than in Shaanxi and Gansu, where opium cultivation is prevalent. The shortage of grain has led to famine. Shandong is protected by bandits, while Hunan and Hubei are hindered by the special tax, leading to the reappearance of poppies in northern Hunan and Shandong. Most lamentable, however, are northern Anhui and southern Fujian. In the autumn of the seventeenth year of the Republic, the central government, at the cost of 3 million yuan in opium seedling compensation, resolutely abolished the Anhui Northern Opium Seedling Inspection Bureau. It is reported that the provincial government also sacrificed over 4 million yuan in tax revenue, abolishing the opium tax and eradicating it all at once. In June of this year, the Anhui Northern Pacification Command ordered the establishment of local silk bureaus in 26 counties of northern Anhui to collect opium taxes and special land taxes. According to investigations in Woyang, Hefei, Yingshang, Shouxian, and Haoxian counties, Hefei must collect 300,000 yuan, Fuyang 200,000 yuan, and Yingshang 50,000 yuan. Taxes are levied per mu of land according to land distribution. This association has received numerous petitions from the people of Tianchang, Shouxian, Sixian, Hefei, and Yingshang counties, all requesting the abolition of these taxes in the hope of eradicating opium. As for the recent situation in southern Fujian, troops are stationed in various villages in Nan'an to provide protection. Opium seedlings have already emerged from the soil. Seeds are being distributed in Putian and Xianyou, and the villages of Hui'an are already deeply sown. Fields are being prepared for planting. In the various districts of Zhangzhou, it is rumored that the stationed troops have allowed opium cultivation and have established an obstruction at Tongyan Ping Suijing Office, collecting opium seedling fines. In the Jinjiang area, planting is widespread. The villages of Funing are already preparing. Our people are suffering and complaining, and their appeals fill our inboxes. Since the central government considers public opinion and adopts a complete prohibition policy, the cultivation, transportation, sale, and consumption of opium should be strictly prohibited. It is inappropriate to collect the special tax in Hunan and Hubei, which violates laws and regulations, and it is even more inappropriate to allow stationed troops to collect taxes, which disrupts prohibition policies. In recent years, the people of the country have worked tirelessly, achieving some success in opium prohibition. Unexpectedly, all previous efforts have been wasted. The people appeal to the central government, which in turn blames the local governments, who then delegate the task to local officials and troops who collect taxes and force planting. The cycle continues, resulting in mere paperwork with no practical benefit. Poppy cultivation continues as before. This association, witnessing these great difficulties, dares not remain silent. Based on the resolution of the Shanghai Representatives' Conference of the Seventh National Anti-Drug Week, we respectfully request that Your Excellency's government consider public opinion, abolish the special tax in Hunan and Hubei as soon as possible, instruct the Executive Yuan to order military and political authorities in various provinces to strictly prohibit the cultivation of poppies, conduct inspections, and eradicate them completely. We also request that the central government dispatch senior officials to Anhui and Fujian provinces to supervise the situation on-site, abolish opium taxes, eradicate opium seedlings, and severely punish officials who fail to enforce opium prohibition, in order to eliminate the scourge of opium. Only then can we fulfill the legacy of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and ensure a bright future for the party and the nation. We respectfully submit this to the National Government. Respectfully submitted by the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association.</p>
<h3>Students from the Shanghai Political Work Institute Send a Telegram Requesting Severe Punishment for Duan Heng</h3>
<p>▲ Regarding the Unauthorized Execution of the Magistrate of Leiyang County</p>
<p>All the students of the Political Work Personnel Training Institute in Shanghai recently learned that their classmate, Luo Cheng, was serving as the magistrate of Leiyang County, Hunan Province, when Duan Heng, the commander of the Southern Hunan Garrison, fabricated charges and had him executed without authorization. They sent a telegram to Chen Mingshu, the former director of the institute and current Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, and Liu Wendao, the former director of the Political Department and current Mayor of Wuhan, requesting them to send a telegram to the military and political authorities in Hunan Province to investigate the facts and severely punish Duan Heng for his crimes, in order to deter violence and console the loyal soul. The original telegram is recorded below: "To the National Government of Nanjing, to Chairman Chen of Guangdong, to Mayor Liu of Wuhan, Having read the news that Duan Heng, the commander of the Southern Hunan Garrison, had Luo Cheng, the magistrate of Leiyang County, executed without authorization, we are shocked and grieved. Comrade Luo Cheng worked tirelessly for the party and the nation and made numerous contributions during the Northern Expedition and the campaign against Gui. During the Eastern Expedition into Hunan, he followed General Commander Chiang Kai-shek and was appointed as the Director of the Political Department of the Sixty-first Division and then as the Magistrate of Leiyang County, where he managed civil affairs and eradicated bandits and communists with remarkable success. However, Duan Heng, who is cruel and treacherous, fabricated baseless charges, disrupted the administrative system, and had him executed without authorization. Although the Hunan Provincial Government has posthumously recognized his past merits and has sent a letter to the Fourth Route Army Headquarters for disciplinary action, it is uncertain whether he will receive a just punishment to console his loyal soul. We believe that Your Excellency has always shown enthusiasm for protecting students. Therefore, we implore Your Excellency to uphold the principles of justice and humanity and to act against treachery and violence. Please send a telegram to the military and political authorities in Hunan Province immediately, requesting them to investigate the truth and severely punish Duan Heng for his crimes, in order to deter violence and console the loyal soul. We await your urgent orders. The entire body of students of the Political Work Personnel Training Institute in Shanghai respectfully kowtows." (Deleted)</p>

<h3>Shaanxi Disaster Victims Beg for Relief</h3>
<p>This port received a telegram yesterday from the Congress of Disaster Victims in Shaanxi Province, saying, "Alas, our Shaanxi Province has suffered a great drought for three years, and seven harvests have not been reaped. Water, wind, frost, and hail have multiplied. Rats, wolves, insects, and locusts have repeatedly followed. Epidemics and banditry are not to be mentioned. Deaths and extermination of households have turned villages into ruins. National funds are a drop in the bucket and cannot save a cartload of firewood. Coupled with inconvenient transportation, the response is ineffective, resulting in being trapped in a desperate situation. More than four million people have fallen into ditches one after another. Fortunately, great philanthropists from China and abroad have heard the news and come to work and appeal, walking in the frost and braving the summer heat, personally providing relief. The remaining people have begun to recover slightly. They were hoping that the autumn harvest would be abundant, and the catastrophe could be eliminated. Who knew that the summer wheat harvest was only 30%, the early autumn was almost completely dry, and the second autumn sprouts were eaten by locusts as soon as they sprouted, covering the sky and the sun, and covering the fields and mountains. Even the latest buckwheat planted has now been eaten without anything left. It is heartbreaking to see, and the pen cannot bear to describe it. A few days ago, the disaster victims of various counties, grateful for the kindness of the great philanthropists in recreating them, elected representatives to the province to hold a welcoming conference to thank Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, Mr. Baker, and the various charities and philanthropists who came to Shaanxi to provide disaster relief. At the meeting, the public proposed that the disaster in Shaanxi is so severe, the dead are gone, and how can the living survive? The disaster victims who are dying are hoping for rescue. Moreover, the autumn harvest is hopeless, and wheat seeds are difficult to obtain. Winter relief and spring relief are all a matter of life and death for us. In addition to asking all the great philanthropists in China and abroad to continue their great kindness and continue to provide relief, and sending telegrams to various charities, we believe that the sea of catastrophe is boundless, and the public can easily overcome it. We respectfully ask you to show great compassion and pity the disaster in Shaanxi. The disaster is great and long-lasting, tragic and painful. The funds are lacking, and there is no soup to continue life. We must publicize and raise funds widely to save those who survive this catastrophe so that the people of Qin can survive and ensure survival. In the future, we will erect a stone tablet and offer incense and prayers, and all our lives will be thanks to the great philanthropists who saved the dying. The telegram is urgent, and we cannot help but shed tears. The Congress of Disaster Victims in Shaanxi Province respectfully kowtows."</p>

<h3>Great Light Case Concluded</h3>
<p>▲Newspapers Resume Publishing Advertisements</p>
<p>The Great Light Cinema, previously banned by the Municipal Party Department from publishing advertisements in newspapers due to the screening of the film "Daredevil" starring Locke, which insulted the Chinese people, has been suspended for almost half a year. Yesterday, the cinema submitted a request to the Municipal Party Department stating: "We respectfully request the withdrawal of the ban on publishing advertisements in newspapers in order to maintain business operations and alleviate commercial hardship. We deeply regret our previous lack of judgment in screening the film 'Daredevil' starring Locke, which contained insulting content towards the Chinese people. We immediately complied with the suspension order from your esteemed association and voluntarily published an apology in newspapers to the Chinese people. Locke himself also sent a letter to our Chinese consulate in San Francisco last month, formally apologizing to the Chinese people. This matter seems to have reached a conclusion. We are willing to comply with the measures previously ordered by your esteemed association, such as publishing an apology in newspapers, inspecting films, and refraining from screening Locke's films in the future. However, the destruction of the film is practically impossible as the ownership of the film belongs to Paramount Pictures. We request your understanding. Since the suspension of advertisements in newspapers, our business has plummeted for half a year, resulting in significant losses. We are now willing to abide by the decision of the Film Censorship Committee and reluctantly pay a fine of $5,000 to atone for our past mistakes. We respectfully request your esteemed association to designate any public welfare cause to which we can contribute. We will comply without hesitation. Furthermore, we will apply to the Municipal Film Censorship Committee for inspection of all future films before screening them to avoid further errors. We hereby submit this request, humbly requesting your esteemed association to review it, inform all newspapers to withdraw the previous ban, and allow us to publish advertisements as usual. We await your command with trepidation." It is now heard that the Municipal Party Department, considering the commercial hardship, has approved the cinema's request. A resolution has been passed to instruct the Film Censorship Committee to thoroughly review the cinema's films and notify all newspapers that advertisements for Great Light films can be published after review by the Film Censorship Committee. The fine of several thousand dollars has been designated to be allocated to the construction fund of the Junyi Middle School. The funds will be temporarily deposited in the Shanghai Municipal Bank and used when the school building is constructed. The relevant notifications have been issued yesterday.</p>
<h3>Primary School Student Kidnapped on Weihaiwei Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>▲Failed to Get the Father, Ended Up with the Son</p>
<p>At 8 a.m. yesterday, three kidnappers driving a covered wagon parked between Weihaiwei Road and Moore Road. They appeared to be workers, and passersby did not pay much attention to them. At that time, students from a nearby school were arriving for classes. Yu, a Shanghai merchant, lived on Weihaiwei Road. His three sons were also students at the school. As they were walking to school yesterday morning, three men suddenly approached them, each holding a handgun. The children were terrified and ran towards the school. One of the kidnappers caught up with one of the children, dragged him into the waiting car, and the other two kidnappers got in as well. They drove away quickly. Afterwards, a report was filed with the police to request their arrest. It is heard that Yu had previously been targeted by kidnappers in front of his house. The victim seized the opportunity and escaped unharmed, but this time his son was unfortunately kidnapped.</p>
<h3>The Clever Plan of a Female Con Artist</h3>
<p>▲Obtained the Datong Alumni Directory</p>
<p>▲Impersonated Alumni Everywhere to Borrow Small Sums</p>
<p>▲More Than a Dozen Victims</p>
<p>Before the summer vacation, a woman in her early twenties, claiming to be the sister of Datong University alumnus Zhang, requested a copy of the alumni directory from Wei, an alumnus residing at the school. The woman claimed that her brother had lost his original copy, and it was inconvenient to communicate with alumni. Her brother was busy with bank affairs and could not come in person, so he sent her to obtain a copy. Wei believed her and gave her the directory. Later, she used it to impersonate alumni for fraudulent purposes. The woman was dressed simply, like a female student, so most people did not suspect her. Over a period of two or three months, she often impersonated the sister of alumnus so-and-so, asking other alumni residing in Shanghai to borrow money. She would claim that her mother was critically ill or that a relative was seriously ill at home and she needed to return home immediately. Unfortunately, she lost her suitcase or wallet en route, leaving her without travel expenses to complete the journey. Sometimes, she would even claim to have several younger siblings or servants waiting at the North Station or the port, waiting for her to raise travel expenses before they could leave. Listeners, seeing her sincerity and the small amount of money she was borrowing, would often generously give her five, six, eight, or ten dollars without hesitation. When alumni recounted their experiences to each other, they realized they had been deceived, but it was too late. It is estimated that more than a dozen alumni in Shanghai have been deceived. Currently, all faculty and students are warning each other to prevent further occurrences.</p>
<h3>A Young Woman from Changshu Remains Untainted by the Mud</h3>
<p>▲Lured into a Brothel</p>
<p>▲Resolutely Refused to Be Forced into Prostitution</p>
<p>▲Managed to Escape at an Opportunity</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a police officer from the Fourth Precinct of the Zhenru Police Station found a young woman in the fields along the railway line. She was wearing thin, short-sleeved clothes and had a beautiful appearance. She covered her face and sobbed. The officer approached her and questioned her, but she remained silent. He took her to the station, where the station chief questioned her repeatedly. She finally confessed that her name was Peng Qiao'nan, from Long Daqiao, Changshu. She was twenty-one years old and unmarried. Her father's name was Lin Fu, and her mother's name was Tao, both of middle age. Recently, her father had been seriously ill and unable to work, so she had been selling fruit on his behalf. A neighbor told her that the wholesale price of fruit was fair in Shanghai, so she should go there to buy it, as the profit would be higher. Furthermore, her father was seriously ill, and there were many doctors in Shanghai who could be consulted for treatment without incurring significant costs. She found this to be a win-win situation, so she asked her mother for ten dollars and came with the neighbor and a local bureau clerk five days ago. They stayed at a certain alley behind the Great World. It was said to be a relative's house. That night, she saw five or six women in a room, each accompanied by a man. Their behavior was frivolous, which surprised her. She asked the neighbor, who suddenly said that this was a brothel. Now that you (referring to Qiao'nan) are here, you will engage in this flesh trade. I have already found a customer for you. After the deal is done, you will get ten dollars, which is more enjoyable and comfortable than doing small business in the countryside. Upon hearing this, she felt as if she had been struck by lightning. She was terrified and wanted to leave, but the madam stopped her and locked her in the room. First, they gently persuaded her to receive guests, but she refused. Then, she was whipped, leaving her body covered in injuries, but she still refused. Although she did not lose her virginity, she suffered greatly. She was imprisoned for four days, and she could not live or die. She washed her face with tears every day. Last night, when they were all out entertaining guests, she climbed out of the window in her thin clothes to the neighboring house, claiming another reason, and escaped from the back door. She planned to return to her hometown, but she had no travel expenses. Therefore, she walked along the railway to Zhenru. Now, she was exhausted, starving, and freezing, so she was sobbing in the fields. As she spoke, tears flowed down her face. She was in a pitiful state. The station chief, feeling sorry for the young woman who almost fell into a fiery pit, ordered her to be sent to the judicial section for disposal.</p>
<h3>The Cardsharps Await Sentencing</h3>
<p>▲Wang Xianting Suddenly Attempted to Recant</p>
<p>▲Closing Arguments Announced Yesterday</p>
<p>Xie Xiasun, a famous chess player, was lured to Room 65 of the New New Hotel and swindled out of $750. The Old Gate Police Station's Chinese detective Liang Chengyu arrested Wang Xianting, Huang Lushen, Pan Guozhong, Li Song, Wei Xiaohua, and Xu Jinsheng. They were handed over to the Special District Court for questioning and detention. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Xu Jiashi, the chief judge of the criminal division of the Special Court, and Zhou Xianjue, the chief prosecutor, took the stand to continue the trial. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that the police had charged the defendants with six counts of fraud. The fraudulent method involved using the "grab stall" gambling method popular among Cantonese people to invite fellow villagers or passersby to gamble together. The defendants colluded to cheat others out of their money. If the victims knew their plan and were unwilling to hand over the money, the defendants would take it a step further, using guns to threaten them, forcing them to write IOUs and retrieve the money from their homes, or having them write promissory notes. Therefore, the police prosecuted them for extortion and fraud. When the police arrested Wei Xiaohua, they found a stack of promissory notes in his home, no less than a hundred. No matter what kind of family, they would never have so many promissory notes. This further proves the defendants' criminal behavior. He requested that they be severely punished. Wang Xianting, Huang Lushen, and Pan Guozhong all confessed without denying. However, Wang suddenly overturned his confession at the police station, claiming that Xu Jinsheng had nothing to do with the case. The confession was written by the detective and he was told to copy it. The police lawyer Ru immediately stated that if it was not confessed by the defendant himself, how would the police know how many cases they committed and who were their accomplices? Furthermore, Wang's confession was handwritten, so how could he deny it now? Therefore, Wang's recantation today must have a reason. Li Song testified that he had nothing to do with this case and was mistakenly arrested. Wei Xiaohua's testimony was evasive. Xu Jinsheng testified that he used to be a comprador at the Keville law firm, then he managed the Shanghai Stage, and now he is a broker at the exchange. He knew nothing about the fraud case and was falsely accused. Finally, Wang Xianting and Huang Lushen's lawyer Dai Jien, Li Song's lawyer Gu Changyuan, Xu's lawyer Jiang Yiping, and the police lawyer Ru Baoyi cross-examined each other. Judge Xu Jiashi ordered the defendants to be returned to custody. The closing arguments for this case have ended, and a sentencing date has been set.</p>
<h3>A Teenager Assassinated in Yangjiazhai, Pudong</h3>
<p>▲Many Axe Wounds All Over His Body</p>
<p>▲One Little Finger Was Cut Off</p>
<p>At around 5 p.m. yesterday, a teenager of about eighteen or nineteen years old was suddenly assassinated on the main road behind Tushan Road, Yangjiazhai, Pudong. He had one axe wound on his left shoulder, one axe wound on his left waist, one axe wound on his left arm, and one axe wound on his left hand, cutting off one little finger. Blood flowed all over the ground, and his body lay in a pool of blood. He was wearing a towel cloth shirt, a brown woolen sweater, black artificial Zhigong silk trousers, and a black artificial Zhigong silk gown. He wore a small hat, white socks, and white running shoes. His face was very thin. Passersby gathered to watch, speculating that the murderer deliberately waited until the sky was darkening to strike, so that others would have difficulty remembering his appearance and clothing. However, no one recognized the deceased at the time, so his name was difficult to ascertain. Some said his name was Xiaoshunzi, a native of Yangzhou, who worked at the third factory of the British-American Tobacco Company. The Third District Public Security Bureau learned of this and immediately sent a chief police officer to pursue the murderer, who had already fled without a trace. The district chief, as the cause of the deceased's murder was still unknown, ordered the local police chief to request the local court to send personnel to inspect the body and verify it.</p>
<h3>Drug Dealers Sell Medicine at a Discount</h3>
<p>▲All Switch to Using the Solar Calendar for New Moon and Full Moon</p>
<p>Drug dealers in various places routinely sold medicine at a discount during the new moon and full moon of the lunar calendar. The National Government believes that this habit of using the old calendar is a significant obstacle to the promotion of the national calendar. They have specially ordered drug dealers in various places to switch to using the solar calendar to correct this. The Shanghai Municipal Government approved the order from the Ministry of Interior yesterday and immediately instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to notify all affiliated organizations to order all drug dealers to comply.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council String Orchestra and Military Band</h3>
<p>▲Performance on the 19th Evening</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council String Orchestra and Military Band will hold their first performance of the season on the evening of October 19 (Sunday) at 9:15 p.m. at the Great Light Cinema.</p>
<h3>Please Prohibit Garbage Dumping into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Shipping representatives Xing Zhigang and others submitted a request to the Municipal Government to prohibit boatmen from dumping garbage into the Huangpu River near Longhuazui and Xiajiazui to maintain traffic. The document stated: "We are submitting a request regarding the dumping of garbage into the Huangpu River, which obstructs navigation. We earnestly request the Hygiene Bureau and the Port Authority to find a way to stop this and measure the shallows to maintain water traffic. The Huangpu River in Shanghai is a vital waterway for transportation between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Without reefs or shallows, large ships from Denglai, Min, and Guangdong, as well as foreign merchant ships, can boldly sail directly to the Huangpu River. This is all thanks to the deep port that allows for the flow. Therefore, Shanghai is known as a major transportation hub for China and foreign countries. In previous years, due to the garbage problem in the urban area, there was no place to dump it, so land was purchased at Longhuazui for dumping. Now, the area along the beach is already full. The boatmen are unwilling to row up to dump it again, so they dump it near the garbage piles along the Huangpu River. Like casting a net, during high tide, it flows with the tide to the Xiajiazui area and sinks. During low tide, it accumulates at the bottom of the Huangpu River near Longhuazui, causing it to accumulate more and more. We often witness this situation when sailing in the area during high tide, but there is no way to stop it. For example, on October 5, we encountered the No. 7733 garbage boat dumping garbage. We approached it and shouted to stop, but they not only ignored us but also insulted us. At the same time, we saw many garbage boats scattered on the Huangpu River, covering their license plates, and rushing to do this work. This is extremely hateful. We believe that the bottom of the Huangpu River is accumulating day by day, and the sea tide and sand are constantly adding to it. What will be the consequences in the future? Furthermore, the banks of the Huangpu River are subject to erosion, and the constant dumping of garbage from the urban area will gradually cause the Huangpu River to become shallow. We are deeply concerned about this and dare to submit this request, humbly requesting your attention. We request you to promptly order the Hygiene Bureau to send police to monitor. After each boat dumps garbage at the designated location, they should be given a return ticket for verification. At the same time, the Port Authority should measure the water line near Longhuazui and Xiajiazui to determine if there are shallows. With such management, the bottom of the Huangpu River will not gradually fill up, and navigation will not be affected. Are these requests appropriate? We await your selection and implementation, humbly."</p>
<h3>French Police Strengthen Security</h3>
<p>The French Concession Chief of Police, Fei, believing that the weather is getting cooler and theft cases are increasing, has ordered all affiliated police stations to pay attention and strengthen security in order to maintain security within the concession. He has also ordered all detectives to be dispatched in plainclothes at any time in teams to conduct inspections to avoid attracting the attention of criminals. Therefore, at around 3 p.m. yesterday, he sent a plainclothes Western detective with four or five plainclothes Chinese detectives to the prosperous areas of French Avenue and Baxianqiao to conduct searches along the way and observe carefully.</p>
<h3>Wei Yancan Remains in Detention</h3>
<p>Wei Yancan, the bankrupt official who attempted suicide by drowning, was prosecuted by the water police for the suspicion of drowning his wife and children. After being handed over to the local court, the court stated that the case was still under disposition. Therefore, the defendant Wei Yancan was detained. However, he could be released on bail pending trial. However, there were no shops in Shanghai to provide bail, so he has not been bailed out yet. Yesterday, the owner of the Central Apartment, where he resided, submitted a statement to provide bail, but it was not approved because the address was in the French Concession.</p>
<h3>Cai Bingren Dies Suddenly After Eating Noodles</h3>
<p>▲Autopsy Reveals Death Due to Chronic Illness</p>
<p>Cai Bingren, who resided at No. 685 South Chengdu Road, went to visit his relatives the night before last. His relatives lived at No. 3538 Xiyinghua Lane, Laubesen Road. After dinner, feeling bored, they gathered some people to play "Bamboo Forest Tour." After finishing, he ate a small amount of fried noodles and suddenly felt a severe headache. He was taken by car to the nearby Labor Hospital, where a doctor gave him an injection, but he did not improve. He died at 10 p.m. Yuan Xinzhong, a detective from the Putuo Road Police Station, investigated and confirmed the facts. The body was transported to the autopsy center on Philen Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Huaipu, the prosecutor of the Special District Court, arrived at the center to conduct the autopsy. Cai Xu, the deceased's wife, and Cai Binggui, the deceased's brother, stated that the deceased had a chronic illness. This time, it was a relapse of the old illness that led to his death. Guo stated that the autopsy revealed that the deceased, Liu Bingren, died due to illness. The body was handed over to the deceased's brother, Cai Binggui, with a signed statement for him to claim the body for coffin burial.</p>
<h3>Utterly Insulting to Elders</h3>
<p>▲ Liu Yutai Insulted by Nephew and Wife</p>
<p>▲ Court Has Issued Arrest Warrant After Lawsuit</p>
<p>Liu Yutai, residing in the stone house opposite Ziyang Lane on Wuding Road, retained lawyer Zhang to file a criminal complaint with the Special District Court against his nephew, Liu Gufeng from Jiangbei, and his nephew's wife, Liu Zhang, for insulting elders. The gist of the complaint stated that the defendant Liu Gufeng had fraudulently obtained twenty-seven yuan from a Hui (mutual aid society) debt owed to the plaintiff the previous month. When the plaintiff demanded repayment, it angered the defendant. On the evening of the 27th of last month, at 9:00 PM, Liu Gufeng, along with his wife Zhang, forcibly pressed the plaintiff to the ground inside the plaintiff's home, kneeling on the plaintiff's ribs, rendering him unable to resist. They then proceeded to beat him, leaving visible bruises on his legs and arms. Most painfully and unacceptably, Liu held the plaintiff's neck while Zhang used a dirty toilet brush to beat him. The defendants' violent behavior was so outrageous that witnesses were appalled. Eventually, Liu Xunwu and Zheng Liwu intervened to stop the assault. The defendant is the plaintiff's direct nephew, yet dared to defy and violate his elder by committing violence and insults, showing utter disregard for the law. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this lawsuit. Based on the complaint, the court issued summons yesterday morning to bring the two defendants to the Second Criminal Court. After questioning by Judge Wu Tingqi, the hearing was adjourned to a later date for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Verdict in Fake Business Name Swindle Case</h3>
<p>Wu Sien from Shaoxing, colluded with Xie and others, who are currently at large, to fraudulently set up the "Ende Silk Shop" at No. 29 Xiangfen Lane, Nanjing Road. Using fraudulent means, they swindled Wang Wuting, a salesman from the Zhonghua Industrial Factory on Bailinan Road in the Shanghai West District, out of 210 bolts of imitation "Hua Silk Gauze" worth 4,380 yuan. After the incident, Wang Yongjun, a Chinese detective from the Jing'an Temple, arrested Wu Sien and the receivers of the stolen goods: Chen Baiming, a salesman from the Yongfengxiang Foreign Goods Shop, and Jin Shaoping, the owner of the Baoyu Silk Store on Jiujiang Road. Together with a portion of the stolen goods, they were handed over to the Special District Local Court. After repeated interrogations, the plaintiff retained lawyer Lin Yingqing to appear in court. The court ordered Wu and Jin to be released on bail, while Chen was detained, pending sentencing. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the sentencing date arrived. Wu and Jin failed to appear after being released on bail. Judge Wu Tingqi, presiding over the Second Criminal Court, announced the verdict: Wu Sien was sentenced to four months of imprisonment for the crime of joint fraud. The number of days spent in custody prior to the final judgment will be deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. He is ordered to be handed over after bail is forfeited. Chen Baiming was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for the crime of transporting stolen goods, and fined 600 yuan. The number of days spent in custody prior to the final judgment will be deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. If the fine cannot be paid, it will be converted to imprisonment at a rate of two yuan per day. Jin Shaoping was found not guilty. The ancillary civil suit portion of the case will be transferred to the Civil Court for trial. Chen Baiming entrusted Jin Shaoping to sell 19 bolts of imitation wool gauze, which the court allowed Wang Wuting, representing the Zhonghua Factory, to temporarily recover.</p>
<h3>Extortion and Intimidation with a Fake Gun</h3>
<p>▲ Zhao and Ji Detained Pending Further Investigation</p>
<p>Zhao Agou from Wuxi, on the previous night, sneaked into No. 300 Hailer Road and threatened Chen Jinhe, Chen Jintang, Chen Jinrong, and Dai Qianqing from Haimen, who were playing mahjong, with a copper-colored fake handgun. He snatched five yuan in gambling money from the table and fled.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Chen Jinhe chased Zhao, caught him, and seized the fake gun. The police from precinct number 2139 arrived, searched Zhao, found the stolen money, and took him to the Harbin Precinct. Zhao confessed that his accomplice, Ji Abing from Changzhou, was waiting at a certain teahouse on Tongzhou Road. The chief sent detectives who apprehended Ji and brought him back to the precinct. It was discovered that Zhao Agou had also used the same method on the evening of September 6th, at 11:00 PM, to rob Zhang Xiaocai of twelve silver dollars at No. 5 Tongzhou Road. He was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was handed over to the Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated the facts of the case. When questioned, both defendants offered evasive answers. Judge Feng Shide ordered them to be returned to custody for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Fire at a Cigarette Paper Shop on Yingxun Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 15th) at 1:55 AM, a fire broke out at the Jinzhang cigarette paper shop at No. 125 Yingxun Road in the South Shanghai district. The fire brigade immediately dispatched fire engines to the scene and worked tirelessly to extinguish the blaze. The fire was eventually put out, but one bungalow was destroyed. Because it was the middle of the night, neighbors were awakened from their sleep and rushed to evacuate their belongings. Afterwards, the neighbors suspected the fire was arson, as the cigarette paper shop had a fire insurance policy for 1,000 taels of silver. The 21st watch guard Zhu Changyan from the second section of the second district, based on reports from the neighbors, took the shop owner, Weng Jinfeng, and shop assistants, Li Fusheng and Cui Yi, into custody. After questioning by Director Guo, they feared the possibility of arson for insurance money and ruled to await investigation and report.</p>
<h3>Ship Accident Causes Duck Casualties</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday evening, a certain steamship arrived and anchored. Several cages of live ducks were being loaded onto barges at the Sixteen Pups Wharf, hired by various duck vendors. Unexpectedly, another steamship began reversing nearby, and the barges could not avoid it. The barges were overturned by the impact of the paddle wheel, causing all the ducks to fall into the water. In a moment, most of the ducks floated to the surface. The duck vendors and poor people from Jiangbei rushed to retrieve them, but the ducks that were salvaged were either drowned or injured. Soon after, they were sold at low prices for cooking. Those that were not drowned were soaked and bedraggled. It is said that the duck vendors suffered significant losses, and negotiations are currently underway.</p>
<h3>Assault on Police Officer Handed Over to Court</h3>
<p>Song Minjie, a patrol officer from the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau, discovered four ounces of opium on Sun Yushan, a passenger on the Shanghai-Minhang bus. As he was escorting Sun to the district bureau for investigation, Sun's accomplices, Chen Zeyi and Guo Haiqing, gathered a crowd, assaulted the officer, and attempted to rescue the suspect. The officer blew his whistle, and other officers arrived to arrest Sun, Chen, and Guo. They were handed over to the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau and yesterday were transferred to the Local Court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Scabby-Headed Boy Lost</h3>
<p>Han Xiaoting, a watch guard from the seventh post of the third section of the first district of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, at approximately 11:00 AM yesterday, found a boy, about four or five years old, wearing a blue cloth jacket and white cloth pants, barefoot, wearing leather slippers, and with a scabby head, lost in the Ninghe Road area. He immediately took the boy to the station. The station chief questioned him about his address and name, but he was unable to answer. The boy was temporarily kept at the station while they wait for family members to identify him.</p>
<h3>Conflicting Blame for Fire</h3>
<p>▲ Both Parties Handed Over to Police Station for Investigation</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 2:00 AM, a fire broke out suddenly on the upper floor of the Jinzhang cigarette paper shop, opened by Weng Jinzhang at No. 125, corner of Yingxun Road and Lujiabang Road outside Xiaoximen. The fire immediately broke through the roof. The fire brigade arrived to extinguish the blaze, but the roof was destroyed and the fire spread to half of the roof of Cui Changyuan's home at No. 871 Lujiabang Road. After the fire, the police went to apprehend the person responsible, but Weng Jinzhang claimed that the fire started on the upper floor of Cui's house. Cui, however, claimed that Weng had a fire insurance policy for 1,000 taels of silver and that the fire was actually started by Weng's family. Since both sides were blaming each other, Wang Fusheng, an employee of Weng's shop, and Cui Yu, Cui Changyuan's son, were taken into custody by the second section of the second district for investigation. It is said that the shop premises and assets belonged to a widow surnamed Lu, who leased them to Weng Jinzhang last year to open the cigarette paper shop, but it has been less than a year.</p>
<h3>Madman on Lan Ni Du Main Street</h3>
<p>▲ Uttering Nonsense</p>
<p>▲ Disturbance Lasting Two Hours</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, a madman suddenly appeared on the main street of Lan Ni Du Town in Pudong, waving his arms and uttering nonsense along the street. The patrol officer approached him for questioning, but was met with insults and curses. The officer summoned patrol officers from neighboring posts to help bring the madman to the third district. The madman claimed his name was Ji Shangyuan from Yangzhou, 41 years old, and that he used to be a detective in the Suzhou Water Police Department. He claimed that his sister had been raped by someone named Xu, and that his brother-in-law had been assassinated, with no remains found. He cried out for justice and then suddenly acted frightened and evasive, claiming that many assassins were lying in wait outside and that he would lose his life if he went out. He asked for armed comrades to protect him. He harassed them for two hours, and the officers on duty could not stop him. Xu, a worker from the Yingchang Match Factory, recognized the madman as Ji Shangyuan, formerly a shoe merchant and water police detective, who had recently suffered some kind of shock and become insane. His sister currently lives somewhere on Wu Ma Road. The patrol officers then escorted him across the river to Pudong.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Money Found on Young Man</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, detectives from the French Concession police were inspecting pedestrians near Beile Road and Pubai Road when they spotted a well-dressed young man walking towards them, looking flustered. The detectives ordered him to stop, but the young man was defiant and refused to be searched. The detectives then displayed their firearms and searched the young man, finding a leather suitcase containing over 100 yuan in paper money. Upon closer inspection, the patterns printed on the notes were blurred and uneven, making it difficult to determine their authenticity. The detectives immediately took the notes to a nearby cigarette paper shop for a detailed examination, where they were confirmed to be counterfeit. They were immediately taken into custody at the police station. After a brief questioning by the chief, the police ordered them to be held temporarily pending transfer to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Autumn Meeting of the Medical Association</h3>

<p>▲ First Aid Course Enrollment: The YMCA recognizes that personnel matters are becoming more complex and dangers are increasing daily, such as the crisscrossing of roads, the chaos of vehicles, the hazards of water and fire, and electrical injuries. Despite efforts to prevent them, dangers are still unavoidable. Moreover, incidents happen suddenly, often without time for treatment, leading to loss of life. Therefore, the YMCA is launching a first aid course, recruiting students to impart knowledge of first aid. It will be taught by Dr. Pan Fuyin, director of the Chinese Leprosy Hospital. Classes are scheduled to begin on November 4th and will last four months. Those interested in joining can request a copy of the regulations from the YMCA.</p>
<h3>No Heavy Taxes on Imported Japanese Cocoons</h3>
<p>Shanghai Zhejiang cocoon merchants Jiang Shifang, etc., previously argued that the import of Japanese cocoons would harm China's cocoon industry. They sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan, requesting that it instruct the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to strictly inspect and heavily tax the cocoons to limit their import. At the same time, the Jiaxing County Executive Committee also telegraphed the central government, requesting that all Japanese cocoons shipped to Shanghai be sealed to protect the business of domestic cocoon merchants. Yesterday, the cocoon merchant Jiang Shifang, etc., received a reply telegram from the Executive Yuan stating that there was no need to implement heavy taxes or prohibit the import of Japanese cocoons. The reason given was based on a submission from the General Chamber of Commerce of Silk Cocoons in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, stating that this year's domestic spring cocoon harvest was poor and insufficient to meet the needs of all silk factories. Therefore, they planned to purchase Japanese cocoons to provide relief and requested exemption from import duties. The National Tariff Commission resolved the matter with two measures: (A) The import tax on foreign silkworm cocoons will be temporarily reduced to 7.5% ad valorem from October 1st of this year until the end of March next year. (B) The tax reduction will be limited to 60,000 piculs, and it should not be used as a precedent. The above measures do not seem to harm China's cocoon industry, so there is no need to impose strict inspections or heavy taxes.</p>
<h3>Shangbao Shatian Bureau Sets Deadline for Accepting Land</h3>
<p>A public letter from the Shanghai County Government regarding the Shangbao Shatian Bureau's handling of official property states: "According to the instructions issued by the ministry and the general bureau for clearing official Shatian property, there are instances where the regulations are unclear. Regarding the obsolete practice of mutually arising issues, after this bureau approves the price and issues a certificate, parties frequently use excuses to dispute the claim, causing unnecessary conflicts and hindering progress. To prevent disputes and show consideration, in addition to cases where certificates have already been approved, all state-owned accreted beach Shatian and official and unofficial shores within the jurisdiction of Shangbao and the city government, whether or not they are already occupied, are given a four-week deadline, from October 1st to October 31st. Adjacent households must report to this bureau themselves, allowing for a clear joint measurement, and they will be allowed to claim priority. If they fail to do so within the deadline, it will be considered a voluntary abandonment. Once discovered or reported by this bureau, they will be punished according to regulations. Anyone can pay the price and claim the land to prevent disputes and facilitate progress. In addition to posting notices and reporting to the ministry, a separate letter is sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Baoshan County Government, and all relevant courts for filing. The attached notice is included with the letter, requesting your government to order its display." After receiving the letter, the county government found that the deadline stated in the notice was from October 1st to October 14th, and most of the deadline had already passed. Therefore, a letter was sent back requesting a revised and more flexible approach. The bureau then changed the deadline to October 31st and resent it to the county. County Magistrate Yan distributed the notice yesterday for posting in various districts to inform the public.</p>
<h3>Director Yuan Cleans Up Detention Centers</h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Director Yuan previously issued a circular to all district and team detention centers, stating that they should be cleaned up to improve hygiene. It is heard that Director Chen of the Nanshi First District General Bureau and its affiliated first, second, and third branches are following the instructions to focus on cleaning and improving the facilities. They are also planning to expand the facilities to prevent overcrowding and accidents.</p>
<h3>Inconvenience of Tax Exemption for Refined Sugar</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Sugar Industry Association yesterday, stating: "Regarding the instruction from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce Shangzi No. 13210, it was found that the Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed regarding the Sugar Industry Association's request to cancel the double taxation of Javanese sugar. This was forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for review and notification. The Ministry of Finance has now replied that the National Tariff Commission reviewed the matter and stated that according to established customs procedures, any imported goods that are re-manufactured lose their original status and are not eligible for tax exemptions on re-export. The goods mentioned in the original submission, such as William's pills, raisins, pigments, and milk, are only re-packaged or divided into smaller portions after import, which is different from the re-grinding of Javanese sugar, which changes its quality and shape. As for fertilizer made by mixing other raw materials after import, customs do not consider it domestic goods and tax it according to regulations, which is not consistent with the facts. After reviewing the above-mentioned refined sugar, the Ministry believes that since the export tax levied by the Shanghai Customs is handled uniformly in accordance with the current tax system, it is not appropriate to grant a separate tax exemption, which would cause disputes. We are hereby informing you accordingly." In accordance with this, we are notifying you to take note.</p>
<h3>Two Notices Issued Yesterday by the Two-Roads Traffic Department</h3>
<p>▲ Public Welfare Proposal: The directors of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways Traffic Department yesterday issued a notice to all station staff along the two lines, stating, "The establishment of the public welfare association for the staff of the two lines is being discussed in several meetings. Baozhao Xinghan and others have been mistakenly elected as members of the public welfare association. We are deeply concerned that our limited intelligence and shortfalls will not benefit the future. At a time when the cost of living is increasing, the implementation of public welfare measures is urgently needed to provide tangible benefits. All traffic staff of the two lines who have worked on the railway for many years and are familiar with the situation are encouraged to propose any beneficial and essential initiatives within one week and submit them to this department for discussion during the meeting. This is closely related to the interests of all colleagues and will not be ignored."</p>
<p>▲ Addition of Stairway Lights: The Railway Traffic Department of the two lines yesterday issued a circular to all station managers, stating, "The Railway Administration has issued instructions regarding the improvement of sanitation facilities on the two lines, stating that the improvement of station lights on platforms should be reviewed by the Traffic Department. If improvements are necessary, the Engineering Department will handle them accordingly. The third and fourth-class passenger cars on this line do not have stairway lights, and many platforms are also dark. Passengers find it inconvenient to get on and off at night, so improvements are necessary. Stairway lights have been added to the stairways of each passenger car to provide light when the passenger car is alongside the platform. This has been tested and found effective and should be gradually increased to facilitate travel. However, after the addition of stairway lights to each passenger car, it is necessary to investigate whether there is still a need to improve the existing platform lights and report the details so that they can be submitted for review."</p>

<p>Robbers Cao Jinmao, Zhang A'gen, and Wang Huiquan, in the past month, gathered a gang armed with weapons and robbed Chen Liepu's home at No. 6 Xing'an Lane on Baer Road in the French Concession. Later, detectives from the French Concession police arrested Cao and the other two and took them to the police station. Yesterday, they were handed over to the French Court for investigation. The plaintiff testified that the defendants forced the servants into one room during the robbery. When the merchant returned home, he was also monitored, and over 200 silver dollars were taken from him before the robbers fled. They have now been arrested, and he requests an investigation. Cao Jinmao, Zhang A'gen, and Wang Huiquan confessed to participating in the robbery. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Cao, Zhang, and Wang to five years of imprisonment in the Western prison and deportation, and they will be sent to the inland authorities for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, After reading the article "Love Letter Causes Trouble" in your newspaper's local news section today, I was shocked and astonished. Upon investigation, our store has no one named Zhao. Our manager, Liang Hongying, employs four assistants who are usually well behaved. This matter is completely a misunderstanding. Your newspaper's reporter made a mistake in listening and publishing the report. For the sake of our store's and our colleagues' reputation, we are writing this letter to request a swift correction. This would be a public service. With best regards, Shengda Nongji Rice Store, 14th day of the 19th year.</p>

<h3>The Vanguard Weekly</h3>
<p>— Tang Bin</p>
<p>Issue Sixteen</p>
<p>Since its publication, "The Vanguard Weekly" has broken through the current crisis of the chaotic Chinese literary and art circles. It is a vital force in nationalistic literature and art. This small publication has even influenced the national literary and ideological circles. In reality, although the newspaper is small in size, its content surpasses most of the so-called large magazines published domestically. Regarding this, we only need to examine the more than ten published issues of "The Vanguard Weekly" to understand it completely. It has lengthy theories of nationalistic literature and art, critical works reviewing the old and new Chinese literary and art circles, sharp and profound discussions, sincere and powerful creations, and heroic and passionate poems, as well as lengthy translated novels with rich national consciousness. From the perspective of literature and art, this weekly publication is a unique and comprehensive paper-based literary and art publication that has emerged in the country. At the same time, it is also a main force in promoting nationalistic literature and art, and a unique flower in the current literary and art circles.</p>
<p>This issue of "The Vanguard" contains four articles. Apart from Zheng Bo's translation of "Two Months' Orphan," which is a continuation of a long manuscript, the other three articles are short and powerful masterpieces. It is rare to see such works in other domestic publications, large or small, that lack a central idea. This is truly a pleasant surprise for us.</p>
<p>Zhang Jiping's "The Subject Matter Problem of Nationalist Literature and Art" is a concrete short essay. It has a great impact on the creation of nationalist literature and art. Everyone knows that the issue of "subject matter" is one of the most important issues in creation. Now that the nationalist literary and art movement has established its theoretical foundation and is focusing on creation, this issue should be actively raised for discussion.</p>
<p>Li Yizhi's "The Masses" is also a skillful creation. The author uses the first person to describe his life in Shanghai for half a year, the homesickness caused by the autumn wind, and the endurance of his wife, showing the unique personality of Chinese women. Old friend Xi Wu reported from Jiangxi about the local disturbances by bandits, and the causes of the masses colluding with bandits. Regarding this, there are more detailed and touching portrayals. With such mixed facts, a creation with a nationalist literary and artistic center is expressed, compact and skillful, revealing everywhere the author's unique artistic skills. The dialogue describing the "Jingwei Team official" suffering a defeat, and others, are the most important highlights of the whole text. I will quote it below:</p>
<p>"Their team was originally scattered, with one detachment stationed in a village not far from the bandits' lair. As soon as they arrived in this village, they slaughtered all the pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks in the village, feasted on wine and meat, and gambled heavily. At night, they were unwilling to stand guard themselves, so they dragged the farmers out of bed to replace them, while they raped the farmers' wives and daughters. Such actions are much more severe than those of the bandits."</p>
<p>"It turned out that the Jingwei Team stationed in this village had been completely killed. The farmers had already colluded with the bandits and were preparing to attack the city on a large scale."</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>"Imperialists, war disasters, banditry, corruption, and local bullies – layers of suffering are imposed on our masses. Our masses will have nowhere to go."</p>
<p>What the author has done above is truly the most worthy creative subject matter for nationalist literature and art. Moreover, the general phenomenon of the masses in the interior must be made clear to the masses who "take Shanghai as a comfort nest." Even in terms of technique, this article "The Masses" is also skillful and reaches a rounded stage. It is a rare creation.</p>
<p>Cha Yi's article "Freedom and Sliced Scalp" is a sharp and moving discussion, giving a head-on blow to the so-called great writers such as "willing to be unfree is freedom" and "avant-garde thinkers." It is a very meaningful work, and readers should not ignore it.</p>
<h3>Manuscript Submission Guidelines for Book and Newspaper Reviews</h3>

<h3>The Grassland Weekly</h3>
<p>— Nan Xin</p>
<p>Volume Three, Number Ten</p>
<p>"The Grassland," the only pure literary publication in the country, its content has a central consciousness of nationalism. Although each issue is only a small sheet, the articles published in it, whether poetry, prose, or creation, are worth reading and deeply touch the hearts of our readers. This is obviously a kind of power unique to nationalist literature and art, and no one can deny it. The recently published Volume Three, Number Ten, has special progress in content. Every article shows a wonderful place. This can certainly be said to be an inevitable phenomenon in the process of the nationalist literary and art movement. However, its artistic breakthrough is faster than other literary and artistic trends. With this point alone, we can clearly see the greatness of nationalist literature and art. To go further, the breakthrough of nationalist literature and art has become a fact placed before our readers.</p>
<p>This issue of "Grassland" contains six articles in total: (1) Zou Fang's "Dusk Drizzle Song," (2) Tao Yisheng's "Marxist Farce," (3) Wu Xiling's "Notes on Female Poets," (4) Tang Zengyang's "Battlefield Iron Blood (II)," (5) Huang Huanruo's "Heroic Toast," (6) "Literary News in Brief" ten items. Now I will introduce them in general below, to share them.</p>
<p>"Dusk Drizzle Song" is a long prose poem in which the author describes fragments of his own life. This issue only publishes the first to seventh songs, but in these short songs, it can be seen that the author has gained an upward consciousness and a heart to work hard towards nationalist literature and art. In the second song, there is such a depiction: "Although this is an unspeakably happy and brave thing, even more sharp guns and cannons than mine are abandoned in the suburbs, with enemies with the cruelty of executioners, still reluctantly surrendering. My bayonet has pierced their chests, and rushing torrents of bright red blood gush out from the holes... So solemn, so valiant, our few shouts shattered the dusk, our songs will shake the universe." From this, we can know how much the author hates the enemies who harm the Chinese nation, showing the courage of the Chinese nation, with a decisive spirit. In the subsequent songs, I dare to believe that the author's performance will be more unique and powerful.</p>
<p>Tao Yisheng's "Marxist Farce" is a critical article that is very worthy of our attention. The author uses extremely simple artistic skills to expose the inside story of the so-called proletarian writers, especially those who translate the Communist Manifesto of Soviet Russia, to the greatest extent. However, the author Tao Jun is completely based on generally recognized facts, just as the reporter of "Grassland Weekly" said in the introduction to the article, "Visible to all, no need to verify."</p>
<p>This kind of sharp criticism, especially exposing the dark幕 and conspiracies of the so-called proletarian writers, is very necessary for the unification of the ideological literary and art circles in the current nationalist literary and art movement. "Grassland Weekly" has now opened this column to publish such articles, which is worthy of our readers' attention. Even Tao Jun's article should not be read lightly.</p>

<p>Youth Forum</p>
<h3>Recent Situation</h3>
<p>— Ding</p>
<p>Jia,</p>
<p>After the letter I gave you last week was published in the "Youth Forum" of Shen Bao, it attracted the attention of all the students in the school. On the morning of Monday, the entire article was cut out and posted on the wall newspaper "Shortwave Radio," with some joking annotations added. It also specially published a special message on my behalf, saying that Ms. Ding has been too busy with her studies recently and has no time to write letters during the day. The general idea is like this. I forgot to copy it down. Jia, when I saw these words, I was really a little angry. Recently, I wanted to invite a few classmates to start a wall newspaper, and try to announce the things that male students perform to us. What do you think? Do you agree?</p>
<p>Didn't I already tell you last time that an article "Father and Son" was published on the wall newspaper "Xi Sheng," accusing Comrade Pro X of using cruel and inhumane methods to alienate young people from their fathers? Although this matter is handled by the training office, it has now been suspended indefinitely. Recently, another wall newspaper called "Return to Morning" has been published. In this, we saw a very noteworthy thing. The content describes a student named Wan who seduced a pure girl, abandoned his wife at home, and even broke up with his family. The authorities not only did not punish him or correct him, but because his father stopped providing him with all expenses, tuition, etc., Comrade X subsidized him with the rubles he received to allow him to enroll. It is said that Comrade X's achievements today are due in great part to him. At the same time, he wanted him to help in the school to make his position as solid as "cement." Jia, look, how can such a person run education and train young people? I really don't know why these teachers and staff members are so tolerant and pollute their own reputation together.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>You're going to say that I'm making a big fuss again, aren't you? But these facts make me too angry. There are such dregs mixed in the sacred education world, so I can't help but say a few complaints. Do you feel annoyed when you read it? Stop it, no more to say. Now let me tell you an interesting fact. Wasn't there a professor of rhetoric here last semester with disheveled hair, wearing a long cloth robe, and carrying a broken leather bag? He looked like a simple, honest, virtuous, and highly respected person, but recently he was called "Deng Tuzi" by the students. The reason is the same as his star pupil, Wan, abandoning his wife in his hometown, playing with maids in Japan, and after returning to China, when he was the acting president of a certain university that had been closed down, he had a relationship with a certain lady who had fled to Japan during the purge. Recently, he held a wedding ceremony in Hangzhou with a certain literary scholar who had been living with him for more than a year. You must say that I heard rumors and that it is definitely not true, right? Jia, but this professor has admitted it. On Double Tenth Day, he invited many people to a big hotel for a wedding banquet, and I heard that he even received gifts.</p>
<p>There have been many rumors in the school these days, saying that the director of the middle school department has not been to school for more than a week due to an incident. A notice was posted, asking the secretary to act as an agent. The secretary could not come to school either, so another acting teacher was asked to handle everything. This caused a lot of dissatisfaction among the students, and the teachers and staff also felt that this was wrong. An English teacher who was a lawyer said humorously, "This school has become like a family. If the father has something to do, he can ask the mother to manage the housework. If the mother has something to do, she can ask the son to act as an agent. This metaphor is really wonderful. I don't know if that agent knows it. I think he must be very angry to be treated as someone else's son."</p>
<p>I said I wouldn't talk about these things anymore, but now I've said it again. I'm very sorry. Now I've decided not to say it anymore. Let me tell you something important. The school will hold a commemorative meeting starting on the 15th, for three consecutive days. Do you have time to come? I'm waiting for you. Our dormitory, the so-called East Palace, will also be open at that time. You can come to my room to play. I've prepared many sweets that you like to eat to wait for you. Promise me, you must come, otherwise I'll be angry. By the way, I've knitted you a new woolen sweater. I'll give it to you when you come that day.</p>
<p>Goodbye, I hope you dream tonight that I give you a warm hug. Ding, in Jiangwan.</p>

<h3>The Distress of College Students</h3>
<p>— Mingchang</p>
<p>I remember seeing someone write something like this in some photo, saying that college life is a poem, and praising how beautiful college life is. I have never grasped this life, and I always feel that this life is neither a poem nor beautiful enough to be said to be beautiful. As far as I feel, I can only say that this life is struggling in distress.</p>
<p>Of course, there are reasons.</p>
<p>When you first step into the gate of a university, the most painful thing you may feel is course selection and registration. Based on your tuition receipt, you will be given a registration certificate, and sometimes you may be given a registration guide and a daily class schedule. Then their responsibility is over. As for which department you are assigned to and which courses you choose, that is entirely your own business and does not require guidance. Maybe you can get some fragmented and unsystematic knowledge from your classmates, but most of the time you have to choose courses like a blind person touching a wall.</p>
<p>What happens after you choose the courses? Of course, you send them to the dean or director to sign. Then you struggle in the crowd, scrambling to get ahead, crowding together like at the entrance of a movie theater. The dean, holding your registration certificate, considers and argues about how many credits to read, like discussing the weight and price in a vegetable market. But he can arbitrarily increase and modify it without asking about your personality, your level, your interests, history, hopes,... But he can't help but do it arbitrarily. You should forgive him. So many people are waiting for him to do this trivial and troublesome thing one by one.</p>
<p>So you have the right to attend classes. Speaking of attending classes, you can think that you should read all kinds of books and listen to all kinds of professors' lectures. They all teach in completely inconsistent ways, each teaching their own things, just like all kinds of goods bought from various counters in a large department store. You pack them in your bag, one package at a time, unrelated to each other. These things are always tied up separately. As for the professors, after class, they each go their own way.</p>
<p>Professors are born to be busy. You can tell from the way they rush to catch the bus after class. This is not to blame, because they have to rush to the class time of other universities. But what about the students? If they have questions, they have to wait to solve them in class. Sometimes professors also encourage students to ask questions, but an hour is only sixty minutes after all. It has to be used for lecturing, reviewing, checking, and adding questions and discussions. If possible, we have to re-reform the clock to the standard. Because questions and discussions delay the regular class, you feel that the course content is not complete enough. If you are busy catching up with the regular class and don't ask questions, students sometimes don't understand. This problem can never be solved by busy professors, and students probably benefit from both incompleteness and misunderstanding. Speaking of lectures, you can think of the professor standing on the podium constantly emitting sounds like a phonograph, conveyed to the students' eardrums at varying pitches. Then the students listen attentively and take notes, just like a moving typewriter. The professor has fulfilled his obligation after finishing the lecture, and the student has completed his responsibility after writing it down in his notebook. It is completely passive and mechanical.</p>
<p>Students, after all, are college students, and they are definitely not willing to abandon themselves. They very much hope to be able to research some meaningful work and discuss some meaningful questions in addition to listening to lectures and taking notes about the courses they are reading. But when he sees his own schedule, he can't help but lose his courage. He has more than twenty hours of classes to attend every week. He has many required courses and things that are not important but have to be read. If he doesn't do it so rigidly, he can't graduate. He has to disperse his spirit to cope with ordinary and mediocre courses. Then he has to put aside the enthusiastic and eager questions to be solved or the things to be researched. Even if he has the courage to research, there is no responsible person to guide him in the school. He cannot take the bus a long way every night to see the professor he wants to see and ask him for guidance and discussion. Even if he could, would the hard-working professor not hate him? Moreover, he not only has classes to attend tomorrow, but he may also have other courses to prepare for, and it is not convenient for the school to leave the school at night. However, this kind of desire, requirement, and impulse always surrounds him and cannot be solved, making him struggle in distress.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic professors are doing their best to encourage their students. They tell them the methods of research and the ways of exploration. They point out many reference books and ask them to read them, take notes, and report. They know that a student has to attend more than twenty hours of classes a week. They also know that a student has to catch up with ten or nearly ten courses a week. They also know that the library has only one copy of each reference book. They also know that there are twenty or thirty people in the classroom and that there are not enough books to be distributed in turn. However, they may want them to submit their papers or inquire within three or two days. Students, after all, are not willing to give up on themselves, but he does not necessarily get to see the reference books, because there is only one copy of the book. So he wanders around and comes up with an improper solution, although it is not what he wants to do.</p>
<p>The most cruel thing in the world is to give a hungry little animal delicious and fragrant food that it can see and smell but cannot eat. There is also this kind of thing in college education. Enthusiastic professors pull out one and a half sides or a corner of knowledge to show off in front of the students, raising their desire for knowledge, but not giving them a proper way to satisfy it. After class, they leave without taking responsibility. Then students without perseverance give up on themselves because they cannot solve it themselves. Those with perseverance grope in the dark by themselves. Maybe sometimes they pull a piece of something that cannot be eaten and chew it hard. They are knowledge-hungry youths who lack guidance, and professors do not have time to guide them, and schools do not pay attention to this kind of facility. As a result, students can only struggle through their four years of life under this kind of distressed life.</p>

<h3>Current Situation of Sports at Jiaotong University</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lu</p>
<p>The sports of Jiaotong University have always been very famous, and the facilities are also better than those of all universities in Shanghai. Since losing to Jinan twice in football and ranking second in swimming, it has lost a lot of color. Therefore, the school authorities strongly advocated it, and the school is also a school that studies engineering, so special attention should be paid to the students' physical problems.</p>
<p>This semester, the school has newly hired Shen Guoquan as the director of the gymnasium. Director Shen also graduated from the school before. He is very knowledgeable about sports and has always had the reputation of "Nanyang Jun." Later, he also went to the United States to specialize in physical education and obtained a bachelor's degree. Director Shen has been in office for only more than a month, but he has achieved a lot of results. The reporter briefly lists one or two of the important ones below.</p>
<p>(1) Heating the swimming pool: The swimming pool of each university in Shanghai can be said to be the best in the school. This time, the Jiangda Swimming Championship was also held there, and the students of the school all like swimming. During the summer vacation, the swimming pool was almost crowded every day. Now, because the weather is too cold, many people dare not go into the water, so the school has heated the water to facilitate the students' practice.</p>
<p>(2) Hiring three alumni as instructors: The school graduated a lot of sports athletes last semester, such as Chen Pu, Chen Yutian, and An Yuansheng. These three are good at all kinds of sports, especially football. The school now hires them as sports instructors.</p>
<p>(3) Holding ball games: The school has held ball games in recent days, such as tennis matches with the American Tong School and football matches with the Zhendan Goryeo team. At the same time, inter-class and individual championship matches are also held, and the results are very good, it is said.</p>
<h3>National Day Commemorative Parade</h3>
<p>— Guan Han</p>
<p>The annual National Day Commemorative Festival, long-awaited and celebrated nationwide, arrived again on October 10th. The enthusiasm for the celebration surpassed previous records. This display of national spirit gives us much to consider. However, it would be a pity to let this unprecedented situation pass by uneventfully. Therefore, no matter how the National Day Celebration Preparatory Committee plans, if it lacks a "Parade Inspector," it will ultimately be a regrettable matter.</p>
<p>"Parade Inspector" seems like an official title, but in fact, it is the opposite, not involving politics. I have wanted to hold this position several times, but I have never been able to achieve my goal. This time, I took it upon myself without permission. Although it involves some hardship, the sights and sounds are incredibly interesting. To allow readers to indirectly experience being a parade inspector, I will openly explain how I came to "hold office."</p>
<p>First, I must state that I reside in Zhabei, so my duties as parade inspector are limited to the area from the boundary road in the south to Tiantong'an Railway Station in the north, and from North Sichuan Road in the east to Baoshan Road.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 9th, due to the importance of my duties, I had an early breakfast and set out to inspect the various roads. First, I paid attention to the form of the decorated archways. The one built by the workers' union of the two roads at the North Station was the best, made entirely of flowers and leaves, solemn and vibrant. Secondly, the one erected by the Commercial Press workers' union in the middle section of Baoshan Road was also good. There were three archway doors, with the words "Nationalism," "Democracy," and "People's Livelihood" written on the lintels, representing the Three Principles of the People. Celebrating National Day and guiding people to recognize the Premier's teachings is the best approach. The archway at the boundary road was made of colored silk, but the colors were not bright, and the dragon head pattern at the top was outdated. It was not as good as the one built at Tiantong'an Station, which was simple and made of paper, but eye-catching and pleasing to the eye. At the Qiujiang Road intersection on North Sichuan Road, there used to be an archway every year, but this time it was missing, which was a pity. A certain store on Baoshan Road near Baoxing Road built an archway at its entrance. It was originally a promotional decoration for a grand opening sale, but the store owner seized the opportunity and wrote "Happy National Day" in large characters in the center. Who wouldn't commend his great patriotism?</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>"Friend, let's go to the Great World tomorrow morning to see Zhao Fang sing, okay?"</p>
<p>"Great, let's go together."</p>
<p>"Little Wu, what kind of fun do you have?"</p>
<p>"Play mahjong for five hundred cars, get rid of it..."</p>
<p>"Nothing, just talking."</p>
<p>Walking along a short section of Baoshan Road, the complex entertainment plans of the people were continuously sent into my ears. After a while, I turned into Xin Guangdong (New Canton) Street. The meaning of this street name is obvious and need not be explained. Most of the houses along the street are inhabited by Cantonese people. In an instant, I heard a question and answer:</p>
<p>"Ah Sheng, is there anything to see at your school tonight?"</p>
<p>"Lots of things. Beijing opera, Cantonese opera, and finally, there will be a performance by the Guangzhou Public Boyscouts band."</p>
<p>"Didn't you say you were going to see the lantern parade?"</p>
<p>"It's only 4:45 now. We'll leave at six o'clock. It's not too late even if it's dark. Why go so early?"</p>
<p>"......................"</p>
<p>"......................"</p>
<p>No matter where I went, my hearing was constantly filled with the voices of young and old, loud and soft, all in cheerful tones, and especially related to the Double Tenth Festival. From this, it can be seen that the public's understanding of National Day has now reached a sufficient level of attention.</p>
<p>It was almost six o'clock, and the lantern parade was about to begin. I thought there must be a lot of material in the parade, so I immediately went out again. On Baoshan Road, under the fluttering national flags, the crowds were seething with excitement. It was indeed very lively, with people coming and going, rubbing shoulders. Tens of thousands of people were watching the lanterns, and under the brightly lit archways, groups of people, each with a happy face, looked up at the Premier's portrait embedded in the colorful frames.</p>
<p>"Here it comes! Here it comes!"</p>
<p>A loud shout made everyone look around. It turned out to be a small team from a certain organization coming from the North Station to attend the parade. Soon, there were similar shouts again. I blindly followed and paid attention, only to be fooled several times.</p>
<p>"Here it comes! Here it comes! It's really here!"</p>
<p>Amidst the noise, it really came. The music gradually came from afar, breaking the silence of the audience. Before long, rows of teams, colorful lanterns, and deafening drums and music were dazzling and overwhelming. It was truly spectacular. In order to see more closely, I mustered up the courage to squeeze into the crowd several times. However, the wave-like surge of people pushed and shoved me, eventually driving me out of the encirclement. Helpless, I had to stand on the side of the road, luckily still able to see, so as not to have failed in this visit.</p>
<p>In the lantern parade, on the second fire department's vehicle, there were two gentlemen wearing masks, making very funny movements, causing the audience to burst into laughter.</p>
<p>The Common Speech Propaganda Group's dramatization of Cai Gengshi's martyrdom was well-performed. However, in this moment of public rejoicing, bringing up this tragic image was somewhat disappointing.</p>
<p>"Dong Peng, Dong Peng, Dong Dong Dong Peng!"</p>
<p>A burst of gongs and drums drew the audience's attention. I took a look, but it made me very unhappy. It turned out to be a school's music team. The school's music was so outdated that it was somewhat undignified.</p>
<p>Among the Boyscouts troops, the Guangzhao Public School was the best. The entire team was full of spirit, neatly dressed, and marched in an orderly manner. They also had a music team, with clear and forceful sounds, unlike ordinary ones. "This music should only exist in heaven." The Guangzhao band can be proud of it. It is said that the team's achievements are due to the support of the school's principal, Lu Songqian, and the dedicated training of teachers Zhang Xunfang, Li Chaoshu, and Zhang Yian.</p>
<p>Among the countless flags fluttering in the air, the 洋服 (Western Clothing) Workers' Union flag was the most beautiful, made of silk and brightly colored, dazzlingly beautiful.</p>
<p>The most ridiculous thing was that a certain company took advantage of the National Day celebration lantern parade to make a wonderful advertising promotion, making their products into lanterns, lighting candles as usual, but the most common phrase "Happy National Day" could not be found anywhere. This kind of promotional material, equivalent to a parade advertisement, should not have been mixed into this great celebration. It inevitably makes people suspect that it insults the event. Now, let bygones be bygones. I sincerely hope that this kind of unconscious mistake will not be discovered again next year.</p>
<p>There were three dragons and one lion in the parade. Each dancer was able to infuse their joyful mood into the performance, so the dancing posture was very beautiful, winning much sympathy from the audience.</p>
<p>"It's over! It's over!"</p>
<p>"Not finished yet!"</p>
<p>Amidst the uproar, the crowd, like the Qiantang tide, surged south in a roar. I couldn't stand still either and ordered my limbs to retreat. As I turned into a side road, I vaguely heard the sound of the military band's flute. This was probably the rearguard of the armed comrades.</p>
