<p>我們的貢獻</p>
<h3>敬告小學生</h3>
<p>小學生，我要問你，你們爲什</p>
<p>麽要讀書？讀了書有什麽貢獻？倒要請你們在小腦子裏，想他一想。有了，你們讀書回來，在家裏没有事，請你們費一些功夫，來查查家裏有没有外國貨。如果尙有外國貨，不是用的廚子·娘姨·車夫·大姐粗心失檢，便是他們的智識程度，還没有辨得清楚。你們年紀雖小，都是熱心愛用國貨的，請你們多講給他們聽聽，什麽是外國貨，什麽是中國貨，用了外國貨，要吃什麽虧，受到什麽痛苦，用了外國貨，彷彿是代養了外國工人，莫怪外國地方找不出强盜呌化子，中國人偏要買外貨，弄到盜匪遍地，呌化滿街，這是誰的罪過？像這種話，你們費一點小工夫，詳詳細細講濱出來，說一個明明白白，使他們了然胸中，他們也有血氣，也有腦筋，愛國的熱心，并不在你們之下，惜乎没有受過敎育機會。你們是讀書的，目下正在受到敎育，正負着未來的重大使命，這個責任，實在是諉卸不下的</p>

<h3>中南美之革命潮</h3>
<p>自中南美之革命潮勃發而後。苦秘魯。若阿眞廷。若巴西。若智利。紛起運動。而所謂共和國之總統。或被逐。或被禁。或尚在危疑不安之中。亦可謂總統之一大厄運矣。今者古巴總統。又傳被人槍殺說。雖尚未證明其實在。然而因總統欲實行停止憲法保障。謠諑蠭起。學生游行示威。其政局不穩之象亦已顯然呈露。何中南美之多故若是乎。</p>
<p>統觀以上各國之革命。秘魯與阿眞廷。巳將舊總統推倒。新政府成立。表面上似已告成功。然而秘之政府。迄未達穩固地位。阿之新總統。阿人漸表不滿。前途尚未可預料也。智利之革命。已告失敗。巴西之某命空氣。雖已瀰漫全國。而現亦在停頓中。至今日所傳之古巴革命。突然而起。形勢若甚嚴重然將來究有若何發展。更未能斷言。故此聲勢洶洶之革命潮。以目前而論尚無多大成功。惟查其革命運動之起因。一爲反對總統之獨裁。一爲不勝外力之壓迫。一爲憤恨政府無解除經濟困難之辦法。此數者實爲運動革命者一致之心理。中南美各國。旣存此種心理而奮起革命。則其潮流所趨。决不由此而遽已。而其成功所至。亦未可加以限量也巳。</p>

<h3>財部甘末爾設計委員會稅收政策意見書（續）</h3>
<p>稅收方面之影響减少賦稅種類、在收入方面不　有不利之影響、賦稅種數减少後對於某種、物品、認爲仍須徵稅者、雖不得不增高稅率、但可擇特種物品能負擔　高稅率者徽收之、一方而　其繳納他種之稅則此　改革、固易實行也、惟於茲應加注意者即稅率之增高、不可貿然從事必須對於稅率增高所加於物品市塲之影　、愼重考慮因　家收入與此影響實有密切關係也、且賦稅　數之减少、亦足以增加純收入、因賦稅簡單、自能節省行政費用也、關於中國稅收行政之問題、當於後文詳論之、</p>
<p>如以上論列爲適當則對於已經廢除之賦稅、不必更求所以替代之賦稅、但因確定稅率、及由課稅表中剔除某種物品、在决擇上偶有錯誤、將不利於財政故爲避免此　不利起見、而規定代替之賦稅、作爲一種預防的及臨時的處置固未管不可、然就大概而論、如前述改革方法能緩步漸　、則替代之賦稅殊非必要、</p>
<p>平衡之稅收制度　稅收制度、對於貿易及商業之影響、旣加以討論、以下所述、當注重賦稅對於各階級人民是否平衡一點、蓋彼等雖不必皆爲直接繳稅者、但最後負擔此種賦稅者、皆彼等也、</p>
<p>現在由國民政府徵收之賦稅、大部分均由繳稅物品之消費者所擔負、此種賦稅負擔之分配、在一部分人視之、雖認爲滿意而他部分人之意見則以爲賦稅之滿意與否、須視賦稅負擔之分配是否按照人民之支付能力、許多國家之立法者輙謂如中國等大致倚物品稅而立國之國家、其稅制廳以　　稅遺産稅等之直接稅修正或補充之、</p>
<p>本委員會曾於民國十八年九月四日提出之所得稅說帖内建議、中國現在不可采行一設的所得稅、其後就特殊或部分所得稅爲進一步之研究、亦不能證明此種有限制之所得稅、適於采用、本委員會之見解、一部分基於所得之性質、一部分基於中國私人賬目之現狀、而主要部分、則以行政性質爲根據、一俟他國視爲適於所得稅之條件亦已見於中國、則中國當然可以采行所得稅、不過初時仍須爲局部的及試騐的而已、</p>
<p>本委員會並根據相似之理由、認中國現在不宜采行遺産稅、此種賦稅、乃以西方各國之家族財産、與其繼承爲根據、唯中國情形則不如是、父母死亡後之孤子、無論對於此項財産之依賴程度或其對於此項財産之管理及使用其身份並不因父母死亡有所變更、在歐西各國通常引爲徵收遺産稅之理由者、即因繼承者一旦驟增産業對於補助國家之能力當然增加、自可課以遺産稅、但中國本無此穩情形、即或有之、亦不過極少數而已、</p>
<p>關於此點之資料雖少、然已足證明中國關於家族及産業之觀念習慣、及産業之登記制度、均與西方各國不同、即使今日中國實行遺産稅之徵收、亦必無若何成效也、</p>
<p>除上述二種直接稅外、尚有一種直接稅、即土地稅、應加以討論、此穩賦稅應由地方政府徵收爲宜、惟事實上有不少國家之中央政府收受土地稅欵之一部、茲將關　於土地稅之土地登記、及自然增價二點、分述於下、</p>
<p>中國關於土地上物權之登記、向無適當制度而於經界之劃分、亦未有精確之方法、欲改革此弊、必須丈量全國土地、但以目下財政狀况而言、則勢有所不能、惟此項工作、儘可逐漸進行、在國家監督之下、儘先就一省或數省或數省之若干部分爲之、</p>
<p>土地産業之明確登記、可根據此項丈量之結果而成立、以達徵稅之目的同時對於産業之徵稅價值應加以估量、俾得校正現存之土地表册蓋此項表册、多在數世紀前作成、其中多有不公平之處也、</p>
<p>目前中國多數縣市、於公共設備均加以擴充改良、尤以國都爲特著、此項改良、足以提高産業之價值、政府於此項私人産業增加之價值中抽取相當部分作爲改良之費用或其費用之一部、此種辦法殊爲公允、對於私人産業、因市政改良而受損害所給與之補償欵額、亦應爲前述費用之一部、關於此項所謂自然增價徵稅之適用方法、似不宜於此詳論、在中國此項徵稅、有已經交回之德國租借地膠州（靑島）爲先例、又關於此稅在廣東省之適用數年前曾討論及之、本委員會以爲前述事例之方法與成效宜加研究）俾於情勢容許之地方、采行類此之賦稅、（未完</p>

<h3>遠征足球隊昨日返滬</h3>

<h3>親友到埠之歡迎</h3>
<p>樂華體育會所組織之中華遠征足球隊、離國三月、重於昨日上午十一時乘法郵波多士回滬、海上諸親好友、羣趨招商總棧碼頭、歡迎如儀、邱飛海·容啟兆·光道章·吳邦偉·王復旦·韋澤賢·李思廉君等、亦在其列呀然一聲、輪船在望、該隊領隊余衡之君等揮手相招、不久舊雨重逢、談笑不已、隨船同來者、有孫思敬·周賢言·馮運估·安原生·戴麟經·陳虞添·陳家球·及張緒龍、下午二時記者重與余衡之君相遇於廣東俱樂部、記者詢以該隊遠征中止之眞相、參加西人會各項比賽之問題、以及樂華以後之進行、茲將余君所述諸點、分述於後、</p>
<h3>遠征中止之眞相</h3>
<p>遠征歐美之舉、籌備已久、嗣乘李思廉歸國之便、代爲接治、大綱已定、於是樂華開始徵集球員、原定以本隊基本球員外、復邀請華南及新加坡諸好手加入、合成一隊、不料香港足球總會對於倫敦方面之詢問、竟加以否認華南球員加入事、遠征雄圖、爲之中止、至華南球員之忽行忽止實緣香港中華及南華二體育會、其唯一維持該會之經濟、端賴足球季之收人、今一旦名將他去、則號召之能力减色、會務進行、勢必爲之阻碍、故不得不設法以撓之也、非爲自私、亦由環境逼迫之耳、然而中華遠征足球隊受此種種打擊、致功虧一簣也、</p>
<h3>參加西人會比賽</h3>
<p>余君謂樂華係西人會之考會員、不宜於未曾通知之前、突然予以假定二字、今將去函詢問、要求解釋懷疑緣故、未覆之前、取觀望態度、如不能得滿意答復、寗犧牲退出也、</p>
<h3>樂華以後之進行</h3>
<p>樂華以後進行問題、余君未有明確之答復、惟謂將俟該會董事會之討論、目下該隊隊員戴麟經、陳鎭和、馮運右、陳家球、江善敬均將爲　南母校服務、其能爲該隊效力者、有周賢言、孫思敬、李惠堂、安原生、陳虞添、數人、李氏今在香港、約於九日來滬、李寗已回沙頭本鄉、來時未知、孫思敬昨夜乘阜陞號返津、一旬後歸滬、現有星洲中堅名將張緒韻暫留滬上、代其工作、就其所述而設、樂華如果重整旗鼓、勢將另行物色人才也、</p>
<h3>樂華將發表經過</h3>
<p>最後余君謂不日董事會將發表此次出徵經過、及經濟狀况、余君本人亦將披露遠徵中止之詳情、俾世人不致有所懷疑也、</p>
<h3>南洋羣島之戰績</h3>
<p>此次中華遠徵足球隊在南洋羣島、東徵西伐、頗著成績、計共賽二十三次、計爪哇十二次、西貢三次、新加坡三次、棉蘭四次、吉隆一次、共勝十三次、和六次、負四次、勝球共六十、負球三十四個人成績惠堂二十四、麟經十八桂成六、虞添五、家球三、光耀三思敬一、</p>
<h3>東西貢全勝情形</h3>
<p>九月廿三日　勝全越選手　八比一</p>
<p>九月廿四日　勝西貢冠軍　　三比零</p>
<p>九月廿五日　勝六省精選　　三比一</p>
<p>以上三戰爲遠征軍得意之作、亦即征程中最後之三次也、個個球員皆恢復健康、各有上好表演、第一戰以八比一勝全越選手、計李惠堂四球、戴麟經一球、曹桂成二球陳光耀一球、第二戰以三比零敗全西貢冠軍、計惠堂獲二球、桂成獲一球、最後一組、惠堂·桂成·虞添、各得一球、</p>

<h3>北站花絮錄</h3>
<p>— 蘭茜</p>
<p>經過長時間的製辦。京滬滬杭甬兩路的員司們都得着一個徽章了。該章長逾二英寸。闊可六七分。當中横着一條鐵路。一隻張着翼子的車輪在那上面跑着。我們當然知道這是象徵什麽的了。在章的上面空白處。寫着「京滬滬杭甬鐵路管理局」字樣。章的背面註着號碼。事先已妥行編定。某號是誰的了。有一位先生拿着了「六零六」號。又一位拿着「九一四」號。都愁眉苦臉。不甚快活。但也没法。「那是「數由天定」的呢。有人打趣着說道。「内服的與外搽的妙藥。我們這裏都齊備了。</p>
<p>秋風抹過了大地上的一切。我們又要實行八小時的工作制。早上八時至十二時。下午二時至六時。劉司長却認眞得很。一早就在巡閱公事房。限着人們來站的鐘點。每月換本簿子簽名。敝處敝課還編着號數大家搶着簽個頭二三名。待到十三號時。他們又犯了「西洋迷信」。有點尷尬。總不想簽。並且還說。「何應欽先生也不簽這十三號的。」但無論如何。這兒總有一位勇敢的人簽上了的。</p>
<p>車上侍者陳鈺庭。在車上拾到了日鈔幣四百十元。是日本陸軍中將某氏遺下的。該侍者拾金不昧。如數交給上頭的人。這邊暫不提及。且說那位中將自從發覺鈔幣失落後。即報告鐵道部。鐵道部查該中將所失各物。與陳鈺庭所拾者相同。即如數奉還中將。中將除了感謝外。亟謝我國人的舊道德尚未盡没。函致五十元於鐵道部請轉送鈺庭。以嘉其義。而勉其餘。鐵道部不受。以爲這是侍者們的本責。記一大功也就夠了。其奈中將又函送轉來。曰非此不可。於是等因奉此了一回。陳鈺庭的名譽就很爲動人了。</p>

<h3>咒草奇風記</h3>
<p>— 荆夢蝶</p>
<p>雲南邊境。有咒草之風。以人工造成蠱物。蓋處女時代事也。女子在待嫁之年。爲將來制服所天計。即於牆外園中。擇定一草咒之。其法每日晨起。獨步至草邊。先向之呵氣者三。然後與之作私語曰「我愛你…你能聽我話否…能如我意否」。如是朝朝。定爲常課。無問風雨行之三年。草即終歲不黄。而通靈矣。女臨之一笑則舒枝張葉。示喜也。復厲聲一呵。則歛葉低頭。示畏也。女至是。則欣然走白母。告以咒草成功。母復隨女往其處。試之果騐。亦驚喜。乃爲之拔歸。製爲藥品。秘藏之。作女贈嫁物。蓋此風久行。母女實衣鉢相傳也。女懷此入夫家。潛置食物中。令新郎食之。則夫對其妻。自不覺由愛生畏。承顔伺色。象憂亦憂。象喜亦喜馴至出入進退。奉命惟謹。命之跪即跪。命之起乃起有時横施鞭撻。亦甘受不怨。雖古之斫樹摧花。無其悍也。限香約水。無其嚴也。此友人游宦滇中者。歸而述之夫種護草以忘憂。見合歡而蠲忿。紫荆一樹。復田眞友愛之情。紅豆幾枝。動摩詰相思之意。草木之通靈者。往往感應人心。然未有如此其奇詭者也。意者。化外蠻民自成異俗。精誠所結。金石爲開。或亦理有宜然者歟。</p>
<h3>勦匪聲中一趣史</h3>
<p>— 公羽</p>
<p>客談臨東鄉勦匪之一趣事云。臨海因連年水災。地方上極呈凋敝。稍有資産者。尚可苟全。赤貧之徒。大都流而爲匪。以致盜賊蠭起。爲害殊烈。官軍加　進勦。則逃此竄被。難絕根株。縣府除令各鄉人民自衛外。並訂賞例。鼓勵人民捕匪。生擒賞若干。格斃賞若干。人民因之異常出力。每遇盜匪來犯。或官軍進勦時。皆奮勇協助。即兵士生擒盜匪或格斃。亦照例給賞。前此有楊匪傳溪之一股。向灘頭赤水兩村。函索一千元。兩村不理。密報東塍鎭駐軍。其地駐有省保安大隊一排。排長侯某。旣悉楊匪將於某日晨糾衆來犯。先期率所部二十餘人。潛伏道左。楊匪來時。突起而要之。遂相激戰。初以匪方人衆。侯有不支之勢。已而兩村鳴鑼聚衆。協助官軍。附近緝私營又聞訊馳來。頓佔優勢。楊匪不能抵抗。率衆退去。緝私營有一兵士。遙見一匪中彈倒地。以爲擊斃。奔至匪所。將割其首級。向縣府領賞。孰意此匪雖倒地。然尚未死且持有手槍。兵至。猛發一彈。中兵之腕。兵痛極幾踣。同時有另一兵奔來。匪又發彈。未得中。而彈已罄。兵則有槍有彈。擊之斃。傷腕之兵忍痛割其首級。又憤其傷彼腕也。以刺刀挖去眼耳口鼻。血肉糢糊。幾不辨其爲人之頭顱。餘匪旣散。此兵仍携首級。往見侯某。請轉報縣府。照例可得十五元賞金。侯某見眼耳口鼻盡被挖去。以爲殘忍太過。意良不懌。乃隨手給以香烟數支。曰去去。此稍酬汝殺匪之功。嗣後愼勿爾。世無此治匪刑法也。於是此兵遂以一時洩憤之故。並十五元賞金之權利。亦隨匪之眼耳口鼻以俱去。僅領得香煙數支不禁大呼負負云。</p>
<h3>趙鐵橋先生行述（一）</h3>
<p>— 趙光祖</p>
<p>民國十九年七月二十四日。賊害先君於上海招商局總管理處之側門。光祖奉電奔喪。到巴黎纔數日。去國五十日耳。猶憶出門時。先君命光祖曰。「兒年已長大。當曉事。留歐大不易。家無積財。及吾健。力作所得。悉以給汝。不給。當稱貸以益之。然吾爲黨人。此身非吾有。有不幸。吾以汝母汝弟委汝矣。」光祖知其言之痛。謂學成有可慰之者。孰知去國五十日。已爲無父之人。長與吾母吾弟思此言而泣血邪。</p>
<p>先君管局逾二年。日以上午九時到局。當從外灘大門入。是日八時半。母與先君同乘。過福州路側門。一從者侍先君下。入門。石梯數級。未盡登而槍聲發。從者仆地避彈。再發。先君負傷疾走上樓。坐秘書室。内外衣盡赤矣。賊奪門逸。母從車中望見。呼巡捕。車夫亦鳴笛。無應者。倉卒間。先君獨登車往寶隆醫院。未到。轉紅十字會醫院。院醫開刀。去污血數碗。檢視。一彈從背入。壞肝葉。洞右腹而出。血外注不可止。過午。創劇痛。至夜九時殁。購捕賊。不得。然識與不識。皆謂先君爲局事死。</p>
<p>先君以十六年十月。任招商局監督辦公處總辦。十七年二月。局改組。兼任總管理處總辦。十八年六月。國府特派專員負責務整理。以總辦代行專員職權。局設五十餘年。規制之不備。組織之不良。系統之不明。贓私之所自出。貪污游惰者之所　穴。一入其　。則兄弟妻妾與所識窮乏乃至兄弟妻妾之所識窮乏皆衣食仰給或牟大利焉。清亡而弊彌甚。自袁世凱。徐世昌。曹錕等歷派大員接管。奉派者畏禍而嗜利。未履局而懷金以去。國民政府旣組織委員會清查整理之。而以改革之事屬先君。或說先君勿以政府名義入局。數十萬圓可立致。先君不爲動。則謀所以刦持之。猶不屈。則謀所以中傷之。先君竟入局。宣政府德意。變更會計制度及本局組織。整頓營業。製精密統計。定規章。訂預算。省用料。理船棧。清局産。凡可以興利除害者。無大小難易。無不辦。上下無結託之私。内外無纎芥之嫌。改組後十月。營業收入激增。諸謀中傷者。關其口而奪之氣。嘗草招商局根本改革計劃。倡「商有國辦」。議未定而國家多事。局有江海輪大半供軍用。營業已振而復衰。先君之死不暝矣。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（二八七）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　翠竹涙斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離</p>
<p>翠筠想想。現在的情况。比了在堂子裏做討人。更加苦惱。更加不自由。。在堂子裏做討人。還有人憐惜。還有人拯救。還可以自己想想法子贖身。現在可稱得舉目無親。這個身體。永遠賣給了他們。永無翻身之日。就此斷送了一生嗎。照那樣的生活下去。還不如死了乾凈。伊想我在此地。好似醫院裏一個害着重病而没有希望的人。除了待死。還有什麽意味。便是死了。也一個人没有知道的。移送出去就完了。伊覺得前途旣没有希望。便什麽也鼓不起興來。年輕的女人們。自然都喜歡打扮裝束。伊到此地位。便連裝束都不起勁。加着身體完全衰弱下去。伊一横了心。連裝烟也不高興了。只說是自己病了。不能起牀。那個寗波老人只好敎别人給伊裝烟。一面還自言自語的說道。殺猪屠死了也不吃帶毛猪。你不裝烟。難道我就癮死了。可是假病會引出眞病來。起初翠筠不過心中不高興。身上無氣力。所以一賭氣睡在牀上。不願意給伊裝烟。到後來忽然自己咳嗽。以爲或者傷了風。不甚留意。後來從咳嗽中帶出有些血的痰來。而喉嚨間帶着一些血腥。伊連忙自己向痰盂中一看。不覺心裏蕩起來。身子也冷了半截。伊暗暗想。好了。這就算完結了。當伊在子細看痰盂的時候。家裏一個小丫頭。連忙去告訴寗波老人。說是姨娘吐了血咧。寗波老人道。你又大驚小怪做什麽。也不知道是牙齒裏的血呢。嘴唇裏的。血便這樣的裝腔作勢起來了。翠筠起初也有些自己寛慰。或者不是肺裏的血。自己心裏的跳蕩。因爲自己驚嚇的緣故。可是過了一刻兒。那個微細而討厭的血絲。還是牽引在裏面。且時而覺得喉間作癢。便想咳嗽。咳嗽了以後。便想吐痰。痰中總牽着一縷縷的紅絲。那時恰巧章乙靑又到漢口去了。翠筠　了一口長長的氣。不覺眼涙垂下來了。伊想起初我以爲我好似醫院裏一個絕望的病人。那時自己還没有病。現在却眞的有了病咧。伊一夜天。涙㾗濕透了枕函。過了幾天。章乙靑回來了。告訴了他。他也有點驚惶。但一看翠筠。面黄肌瘦。眼大　落。完全是一個病人。他想離開了有趣好玩的地方。來和病人作伴。　覺减少興味。因此對於羣筠。不免也有了落寞之感。</p>

<p>厘拆價格　（洋厘）早午市價均爲七錢二分九厘半、較前日午市之低盤則改昂一厘半、然較前數日價相距已及半分以上總之從前之漲、出於意外而目前之跌、亦非吾人所可逆料、而現在市價、可望正式鎭定矣、（銀拆）早市銀拆爲六分、午市又弱一分、僅爲五分、劃頭又有濫象故無加水而開白劃、銀行無掛牌</p>
<p>輔幣市情　江南小洋聲色依然、早午市價均爲六錢五分四厘　較前日早市相埒、做出交易早市三千角午市二千角、廣東小洋、早市爲六錢三分六厘、午市爲六錢三分七厘、結果較前日午市改昂二厘、而形勢亦入定矣、做出交易早市十一萬角、午市八萬角銅元仍爲三百八十三千文、交易三萬三千餘串</p>
<p>銀洋進出　（銀欵）昨市銀行收解、以前日之餘波、比較平時稍繁、華商收解票欵二百五六十萬、外商收解票欵二百餘萬、結欵收解、中外各銀行二三百萬、特欵收解八九十萬、各種貨匯稅什諸欵收解八百六七十萬出倉八十萬、進倉六十萬、日商銀行收解各欵四百二十餘萬、出倉五十萬錢莊銀公單收解三千三百餘萬、劃頭欵收解四百十餘萬、各路匯欵收解七十餘萬收現七八十萬、（洋欵）匯劃票欵、早市做出一百○三萬、午市做出五十六萬五千、鈔票早市無交易、午市做出三萬、場外鈔票早市十四萬五千、午市六萬五千、新幣交易兩市七八萬、銀行交易、早市互市五十萬、午市五十五萬、各銀行洋户往來收解一百五十餘萬、鈔票進出一百三四十萬錢莊洋公單收解四百五十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解二百十餘萬、斥借洋欵一百三十餘萬小同行做出匯頭鈔票新幣等交易六七萬、客路來源一百餘萬、去胃三十萬、</p>
<h3>上月份存息二兩九五扣</h3>
<p>上月份（九月）銀根上半月甚濫時常白借、或二三分、下半月始一錢餘之市面、然間有以數分時居多、故全月統計、銀拆總額僅二兩○三分、平均三十天擬計每天僅佔六分七厘六七毫、但每月存息之議價、向以隨銀拆之高低而定準繩、今銀拆旣小、底盤自不能昂故前日公便、議决存息仍以二兩九五扣而欠息亦照常例、以四兩半坐盤遞加、如是則最高價仍在十兩○五錢之譜、</p>
<h3>證劵　債市閒散價穩定</h3>
<p>昨公債現貨雖開出多種但成交仍極稀少、期市亦較前日爲清、債市以環象沉靜、求供均衡、盤旋甚鮮變化、結果比前日互有漲跌、内除關稅裁兵整六等現貨比上星期約大一元外、其他各祇有數角變動、計全日現貨共　一萬二千五百元、期貨上午計三百六十餘萬、下午僅約三百萬元、合計六百六十餘萬、内惟裁兵尚佳、編遣一九捲亦不寂寞、其他均極清同云、</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市非常平庸</h3>
<p>紗市平疲、實以大勢情形不振、東洋三品紗猛跌、故人心趨低、現紗需要較爲岑寂、且英廠乘機大批開出、約有一萬多包、有此巨量之現貨、賣方心思愈覺安靜、故潮州帮做空之念深、而有一巨廠商心思平澹、惟有一小部分極力看高、然世界狀况不佳、難以獨漲也、多數買方須看節後有大批客銷發展云、</p>
<p>人標削落八九錢　人標前市開盤、以隔日有大批廿支五福牧羊紗開出、市氣略鬆、買户較缺、各跌一·二·三·四·五·六錢、午後聞現紗需求不暢、三品紗又猛跌、因之人心騾虚、市勢尤弱、各跌三·四·五·六·七錢、全日成交統計一萬零九百五十包、查賣出義餘一千二百包、達豐九百五十包、茂記四百五十包、愼昌五百包、其餘二百五十包至四百包、買進益昶七百五十包、公泰五百五十包、榮興五百五十包、天成五百包、其他二百包至三百包、茲將人標收盤價錄左、　　人標價漲跌存賬數　收盤價漲跌存賬數十月一五二六跌六三一、五五０　一月　一五二五跌九　三三、四００十一月一五二五　八三九、六００二月一五二六　一０一三、八００十二月一五二五　八三七、九五０三月一五三一　八　四五０　　現銷比較略進展　現紗銷路較佳、查全日各帮買去統計一千一百七十五包、徐州進一百八十五包、四川進三百二十包、漢口進一百五十包、汕頭進九十包厦門進六十五包、廣東進二百三十包、雜帮進一百三十五包、行情平平云、</p>
<h3>棉市重入疲境</h3>
<p>昨美棉來電微漲、本埠棉市稍疲、實以現需清澹、各廠吸進外棉頗巨、本棉地位、被其侵奪、所以殊難續漲、終以目前因出新未旺、來源不暢、鄉農拉緊不放、故市氣堅挺、實際仍難樂觀、聞十二月份印美兩棉、均有大批抵滬、届時之變遷、恐非淺鮮焉、</p>
<p>標棉步跌二錢　漢標前市開盤、以美棉市情平平、買氣較澹、各跌五分至一錢、午後市况仍疲、又跌五分至一錢、全日成交統計二萬三千七百擔、查賣出長豐二千八百包、永豐一千二百擔、晋豐一千五百擔、賡豐一千三百擔、瑞大一千四百擔、義成一千一百擔、元泰一千五百擔、其餘五百至一千擔、買進源大二千六百擔、榮興一千三百擔、大昌成一千二百擔、其餘六百至一千擔　茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>美棉與三品背馳</h3>
<p>美棉趨勢續堅　昨美棉初因利物浦消息良好而漲、旋因華爾街人心不振而疲、卒因空户抵補再堅、計期貨漲四至十磅音、現貨漲五磅音、英棉期貨漲六七點、現貨漲十點、埃及棉現貨漲十五點印棉停市、原電錄左（二日電）</p>

<h3>糧食　米市續跌半元</h3>
<p>閘北　昨日各帮來船略稀、計三十號左右、市銷一蹶不振新粳到頭雖薄、然河存尚厚、故行情續小半元、高貨開十六元五角、普通十五元八九角、東新廠方稍有扳售、惟出數不多銷揚呆木價亦見疲兩三角、早稻高開十六元零、交易寥落市形欠佳、破粳到源甚枯、此種落令之貨、行將絕跡大盤平平、特别頂貨當在十九元六七角中關十七元半、杜子子秈買氣不振來貨尚接、小去四角許開爲十三元零、羊尖祗開十二元七八角爲度、而客尖因産訉有轉穩之說、貨户似帶緩守之意、價見短兩三角、高開十一元左右、埠尖續告下游、市胃不化、跌落三角外、開出十一元三四角、白元到銷不猛、頂貨十七元六角、</p>
<p>滬南　昨日河到二三十號、本街銷塲有限、各方因天有運請之象、均不立急進、是以交易呆而價續軟矣、此間常帮新粳與滬北彷彿、高開十</p>
<p>六元四五角、見跌四五角不等、蘇同帮與本鄉一帶抵埠之新粳、均小半元以上、高爲十四元半至十四元、羊杜尖特頂貨開十一元七八角、計疲去四角餘、情况極爲無神、新尖店方胃淡、行情逐步見削、大盤十元零六七角、</p>
<h3>本月粉挫落三分</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、五月份市面、初尚平定、惟至二盤以後、本月份突生搖動、因前月份之大批棧單、多頭方面、多數尚未出檔、各客帮因此項貨品、有係新粉時之積貨、經數月之存積、粉質上未免略有變態、故此項棧單、客家大致不顧販裝、致大户方面、難免皇急、因此向本月份之標準、大量套出、以免再受暗耗、有貨之廠家、則仍陸續出檔、蓋貨價愈高、抛出者彷彿更多一機會、因此本月份步步暴落、某廠亦不再維持、亦暗中狂出、所以市面大疲、竟跌進四錢關口、後步如粉無出路、多方當不免受虧也、結果本月份較前日跌三分、十一月份跌一分七厘半、十二月份跌一分、三月份跌一分半、三月份跌一分七厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥市一致下游</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、因洋麥報價、仍好四角左右、故人心曾一度激昂、惟以後因粉價不振、及已經定有洋麥之空頭、見此高價、又一致狂抛、致市面復見疲象、下午則傳粉市因客銷不起、將一蹶不振、致各月份之賣氣、又見大暢、市面亦步步大跌此種反覆不常之態、因人心已人歧途、實少捉摸也、結果本月份較前日跌七分、十一月份跌八分、十二月份跌四分、二月份跌六分、三月份跌五分、現麥市况、因廠胃尚佳、各儅互有升降、中次之貨、終須受殺開山東紅日麥海州道人喬東台瑤灣駐馬店麥共一萬三千餘包、由福新一家辦去云、</p>
<h3>客秈有厦門去化</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到頭不多、客化尚活、市而似有佳象、但被新到之西貢米軋脚、行情未能轉好、去路除本街外、厦門帮亦在市採辦江西蕪湖兩米各二三百包、故人心尚佳、統市售開江西機早一千五百包、價十一元至十元零六角、又機晚六百包、價十二元至十一元六角半、又機元米一百包、價十三元八角至十三元六角、蕪湖機米三百包、價十元、洋米尚未完全上棧、亦未成交云、</p>
<h3>標準期連豆續漲</h3>
<p>昨日大連元豆、十二月期因連市又告向上、各方一致暢進、本街與廠方進意尤活故下午價格續漲三四分不等、刻下標準各期、在此兩市中、見昂一錢以上、斯乃久疲之局勢、一經開展、市况遂益緊俏矣、收市爲四兩九錢二分、較前日好四分、</p>
<h3>絲茶　米蘭義繭價又跌</h3>
<p>米蘭市塲各絲厥因義絲歐銷步趨疲滯、存絲日厚、大半减工停機、乾繭廠銷益無生氣、繭價步跌、週問春乾繭祗開八十四利拉、夏繭七十六利拉、秋繭六十一利拉、又跌一二利拉、趨勢仍難立住云</p>
<h3>洋莊絲銷益寥落</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、益趨寥落、緣全滬絲廠已告停業、廠絲無市、而歐美絲電仍鮮轉滬、歐莊購胃益呈閒散、昨祗信孚等進川黄摩經三十包、伯興等進黄搖經十一包、價均平疲云</p>
<h3>高莊珍眉法銷略動</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、婺源屯溪等路之高莊珍眉綠茶、保昌天祥同孚等行、均略有進胃、路莊抽芯茶、項盤開出二百二十兩、較前仍頗堅定、惟是中低莊茶、供過於求無從挽回頽勢日來開出茶價、較前均低、年内似無回漲之望至紅茶市面尤爲呆滯、英俄兩莊均無動辦消息云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　包子貢供不應求</h3>
<p>本廠布　昨日趨勢紊亂、細布疲弱、走銷甚寂、粗布暢達缺乏現貨、湖北天字因到稀已售至八兩二、十一磅三兎三鹿廣帮昨成交二百多件、故較人鐘須高一錢七分半、十三磅粗在江西帮昨進一百件、雙馬馬狗現貨亦缺、粗料紋北帮購胃轉活、昨津帮進三兎三魚貓英等牌一百五十件、所以市氣稍堅、細斜續漲、陽鶴已開七兩三錢二分半、藍雙魚亦七兩出關、較細布超出達三四錢、</p>
<p>東西疋頭　東貨因三品見軟、又因時届節邊、漲風已平、直貢呢直貢緞各稍下落、細嗶嘰定價已稍接近、故連日湖心亭定出有三四百件、價爲三錢至二錢九分半、月華　昨黑花中花因墊銀關係、略見下落、盛極一時之印花綫、昨亦轉疲象、前開二錢三分半者、今則二錢三分至二錢二分半亦有脫手、惟新花色子貢仍異常堅昻、且到貨後有供不應求之狀、去路除本埠門莊店外、汕頭·鎭江·寗波·等帮亦頗暢達、榮華富貴最亮售二錢八分半、壽老騎鹿二錢七分半較春令最疲時漲起一錢以外矣、</p>
<h3>呢絨及時暢銷</h3>
<p>毛貨呢絨正值銷令、本街客帮俱有購辦、蓋天氣漸冷、實銷發動門莊零剪生意、及洋服舖現定套頭西裝大衣者、日形激增、　貨如直貴·嗶·嘰華特呢·色丁·巧克丁·花呢等鹿貨如　爾登·平厚呢·夾呢駱駝絨·紫貂豹皮　·　黑擒　·海虎絨·五彩閃色與精子大衣呢·鞋毡之類、逐日成交亦甚鉅、各號向洋行打　單出貨者甚形擁擠云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　荔枝干走銷呆滯</h3>
<p>奥貨均遭虧耗··建貨亦難合算荔枝干近因桂圓上市、走場頗爲呈滯、而來源亦甚稀少、除金山枝·水東枝陸續有少數運到外、餘如蘭竹枝烏叶枝皆無到來、據厦訉、地價挺立、殊乏鬆望、香港廣東地價雖有見軟、然終不合算、故各自辦、號家前後開出均遭虧蝕、建帮號家久無開兌、良以銷路不動所致、現市行盤金出枝二十七八兩、揀蘭竹二十九兩半、次不一、市象平疲、</p>
<h3>生粉市盤向下疲</h3>
<p>生粉近日致貨、逐漸湧旺、且聞　　産價、各檔報跌一盾半、客路去化、反覺岑寂、行號市盤、因以一致趨跌、刻下行盤、兜售歐州牌十一兩國旗牌八兩、靑塔三魚牌七兩八九錢、紅三蝦牌、五兩三錢、黑三手牌五兩至四兩七八錢東洋貨小包十一兩八錢、大包十一兩二錢、長江各埠、需要均懈、惟本衛生意、尚稱熱閙、然祗有零星交易、而乏躉批去路、故市成供過於求、存額日見加厚耳</p>
<h3>糖市　糖市依然沉寂</h3>
<p>神户糖廠盤且少問津昨日糖市産區電訊占巴現糖價爲一○九三七五、比前電微升○六二五、紐約期糖十二月份價一·○六、比跌二分、明年度三月份一·一七、五月份一·二五、均無升沉、九月份一·三七、亦比跌一分、爪哇現糖價八·一二五、期糖十月份八·○○各跌一·二五、十一月份八·○○十二月份七·八七五、均無上落、本埠公會市場　盤、荷糖二十四號租砂白、買氣仍寥、新貨粗砂白八兩、陳貨七兩八錢、十八號中砂白七兩七錢、交易零落、市形仍弱、荷赤以到貨將抵、市亦略平、日糖Ｎ嘜喊價八兩YP八兩ＶＴ嘜七兩八錢半Ｆ嘜八兩一錢、ＳＨ嘜七兩八錢、亦少問津、廠盤神户　　　四元工殂尚稀受手、良以市存雖薄、而走銷殊　、以故行方進意極淡也、號盤有本廠氷花靑開價七兩六錢　禎祥號售出、古巴洋二百袋、價六兩八錢、比前盤各跌一錢、而市且萎弱、現貨二十四號陳粗砂白亦售開四百袋、價爲七兩八錢半、油袋者七兩七錢、市氣仍黯澹乏神、</p>

<h3>Announcement to Elementary School Students</h3>
<p>Elementary school students, I want to ask you, why do you study? What contribution does studying bring? I would like you to think about it in your little brains. Now, when you come back from school, if you have nothing to do at home, please take some time to check if there are any foreign goods in your home. If there are still foreign goods, it is either the carelessness of the cooks, maids, drivers, or elder sisters, or their level of knowledge is not clear enough. Although you are young, you are all enthusiastic about using domestic goods. Please tell them more about what foreign goods are and what Chinese goods are. Tell them what losses and pains they will suffer from using foreign goods. Using foreign goods is like raising foreign workers for them. No wonder there are no robbers or beggars in foreign countries. Why do Chinese people have to buy foreign goods, resulting in bandits everywhere and beggars all over the streets? Whose fault is this? You can spend a little effort to explain these things in detail, make it clear so that they understand it clearly. They also have blood and brains, and their enthusiasm for loving the country is no less than yours. It is a pity that they have not had the opportunity to receive education. You are studying and currently receiving education, bearing the important mission of the future. This responsibility cannot be shirked.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Revolutionary Tide in Central and South America</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the revolutionary tide in Central and South America, Peru, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile have all launched movements. The presidents of the so-called republics have either been expelled, imprisoned, or are still in a state of precarious uncertainty. This can be said to be a great misfortune for presidents. Now, it is rumored that the President of Cuba has been shot, although this has not yet been proven. However, because the president wants to implement the suspension of constitutional guarantees, rumors are rife, and students are marching and demonstrating. The instability of the political situation has become apparent. Why are Central and South America so troubled?</p>
<p>Looking at the revolutions in the above countries, Peru and Argentina have overthrown the old presidents, and new governments have been established. On the surface, it seems to have been successful. However, the government of Peru has not yet reached a stable position, and the people of Argentina are gradually expressing dissatisfaction with the new president. The future is still unpredictable. The revolution in Chile has failed. Although the atmosphere of revolution in Brazil has permeated the country, it is currently at a standstill. As for the Cuban revolution that is rumored today, it has risen suddenly, and the situation seems very serious. It is impossible to predict how it will develop in the future. Therefore, this tumultuous revolutionary tide has not achieved much success at present. However, upon investigating the causes of the revolutionary movement, one is to oppose the president's dictatorship, one is to be unable to withstand the pressure of external forces, and one is to resent the government's inability to resolve economic difficulties. These are the consistent motivations of those who are driving the revolution. Since the countries of Central and South America have these motivations and have risen up in revolution, the trend will definitely not stop here, and the extent of its success cannot be limited.</p>

The reason is that the current Northwest Scientific Investigation Team is investigating in Xinjiang and has not yet been completed. The method will be determined after the team completes its examination and reports the results. (2) The case of American Smith and others being organized by the Chicago Museum of Natural History to investigate animals can be allowed to enter the country for investigation. The conditions will be decided by the Central Research Institute and the Ministry of Education. Before entering the country, the following items must be submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for transfer and compliance: 1. The group must first submit a plan for investigating animals, which will be sent by the embassy to the government for review by the competent authorities. 2. The number and brief history of the members of the group should be stated. 3. The number of weapons allowed to be carried should be the same as the number opened in the previous document from American Minister James, but the passport must be verified by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and transferred to the Ministry of Military Affairs for approval and issuance of a license to carry weapons. 4. Measuring instruments are not allowed to be carried. 5. China will send personnel to participate in the investigation. 6. Half of the collected specimens will belong to China to commemorate them, and the only ones with no duplicates should be left in China. After the group signs all the conditions, the competent authorities will consult the provincial governments of Yunnan and Guizhou to check before entering the country. (3) Regarding the matter of foreigners coming to China to investigate science in the future, the Central Research Institute and the Ministry of Education will formulate a unified method and then invite the relevant departments to meet and approve it.

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister of Finance and Navy Resign</h3>
<p>General Ambo Succeeds</p>
<p>Japan Union, Tokyo, 3rd - The Minister of Finance and the Minister of the Navy submitted their resignations at 10:00 AM this morning. Prime Minister Hamaguchi met with the Emperor at 11:20 AM to report on the situation and decided to appoint General Ambo as the successor.</p>
<p>Electric Communications, Tokyo, 3rd - At 1:30 PM today, the Emperor's appointment ceremony for General Ambo as Minister of the Navy was held in the Phoenix Pavilion of the Imperial Palace, with Prime Minister Hamaguchi and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi in attendance. At the same time, the resignation of the Minister of Finance and the Minister of the Navy was approved.</p>
<p>Electric Communications, Tokyo, 3rd - The new Minister of the Navy, General Ambo, stated his feelings on taking office, saying, "This appointment was entirely sudden, almost as quick as a thunderbolt. I do not know anything about the national defense supplementary plan, but I will actively pursue it with all my beliefs."</p>
<p>Electric Communications, Tokyo, 3rd - At a time when the London Treaty issue has come to an end, the sudden change of the Minister of the Navy, coupled with the hope within the party that Minister of Commerce Tagawa and Minister of Agriculture Machida will take advantage of the situation, is quite enthusiastic. The observation that a partial cabinet reshuffle will extend the cabinet's life is gaining momentum.</p>
<p>Electric Communications, Tokyo, 3rd - The Secretary-General of the Seiyukai, Mori, said regarding the resignation of Minister of Finance, "The person responsible for causing so much anxiety to the people suddenly resigns, which is extremely incomprehensible. There must be a major reason lurking inside. There were two times when Minister of Finance should have resigned: one was before the signing when the three major principles of the convention could not be implemented, and the other was after the national defense supplementary plan was completed. Now, Minister of Finance did not resign at the first time, but resigned before the second time arrived, which cannot be said to be a complete fulfillment of his duty. Because Minister of Finance lacked a bright attitude, he lost the support of the people in the Navy Department, so he made this kind of cowardly escape. The difficult position of the successor Minister of the Navy is most sympathetic."</p>
<p>Electric Communications, Tokyo, 3rd - Although the reason for the resignation of Minister of Finance is said to be due to illness and inability to cope, the Minister of Navy's decision to resign had already been made when he returned from the London Conference. The delay until now was to fulfill his original intention. General Ambo is also familiar with the supplementary plan, so there are no difficulties. The matter has been completed simply by the Minister of Finance handing over his duties. Generally speaking, Ambo's appointment is said to be able to refresh the morale within the Navy Department and is regarded as the most suitable person for ensuring the completion of the national defense plan.</p>
<h3>Poincaré Intends to Return to Politics</h3>
<p>Briand Returns to Home Soil</p>
<p>Monarchist Opposition Protests</p>
<p>National Society, Paris, 2nd - Yesterday, former Prime Minister Poincaré, current Prime Minister Tardieu, and Minister of War Maginot held lengthy talks at Maginot's villa. The content was kept strictly secret. The French political circles generally expect Poincaré to return to form a cabinet soon, as Tardu is finding it increasingly difficult to govern and may retreat to the role of Minister of the Interior. Poincaré's desire to run in next year's presidential election also necessitates another return to politics.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 2nd - French monarchists held a hostile demonstration today when Foreign Minister Briand arrived in Gretz-Armainvilliers from Geneva. A man named Bausson, who was wounded in the Great War, ran up to Briand as he stepped off the train onto the platform and accused him of provoking Germany. He was then arrested by the police and imprisoned. Shortly afterwards, a number of monarchists caused a disturbance on the Rue de la Pompe.</p>

Russian officials stated that the two sides exchanged views on all important international issues and reached complete harmony.

<h3>The Spanish King Is Reluctant to Relinquish Power</h3>
<p>Maladministration Leads to Popular Grievances</p>
<p>Republican Uprising May Be Difficult to Suppress</p>
<p>National Society, Madrid, 2nd - Republican sentiment is rising in Spain. Although the capital and provincial cities appear calm on the surface, the situation is actually very tense. The people are increasingly dissatisfied with the current government's failure to fulfill its promises, to quickly and completely eliminate the maladministration of the dictatorship, to enact laws, and to reduce economic panic. As a result, there is a possibility of revolution breaking out at any time. In an effort to suppress the republican uprising and preserve the monarchy, the Spanish king will soon form a liberal monarchical government and appoint Alba as prime minister. Alba was once known as a republican, but recently changed his attitude and is willing to assist the monarchy. According to his friends, this is because the Spanish king has made important concessions, agreeing to reduce the autocratic power of the monarchy, adopting the British constitutional monarchy system, and personally guaranteeing that if Alba forms a new cabinet, he will abolish the offices of the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, which are subordinate to the monarchy, and that he will not meet with people of political importance without responsible cabinet members present. He also agreed that as soon as the new cabinet is formed, he will issue a decree stating these guarantees, so that they may be permanent, and that he and his successors will be bound by them for life. Therefore, Alba is willing to come out and assist.</p>

<p>Reuters, New York, 2nd - A dispatch from the Cuban capital states that the Cuban President has written to Congress requesting the suspension of constitutional guarantees in Havana and surrounding areas before the general election on November 1st. Constitutional guarantees refer to civil rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. Therefore, the suspension of these guarantees is equivalent to a disguised form of martial law.</p>

<h3>Our Preparation for the Sino-Russian Conference</h3>
<p>Expanding the Scope by Adding Four Special Commissioners. Fu Zhanwen Discusses the Situation of Our Representatives. A dispatch from Harbin states that Fu Zhanwen, a diplomatic messenger of the Chinese delegation to the Sino-Russian Conference, returned to China on September 26 under the orders of Mo Dehui to deliver documents. Upon arriving in Harbin, Fu immediately delivered the documents to the Office of the Supervisor of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which forwarded them to Liaoning. It is reported that the mission Fu was entrusted with and the content of the delivered documents was to request the Northeast authorities to telegraph the Central Government, requesting the addition of four specialized commissioners and an increase in the delegation's office expenses. This is because the scope of the Sino-Russian Conference has been decided to be expanded, and the four special commissioners accompanying Mo in Russia have not done much research on commercial treaties, navigation rights, and other matters. Therefore, it is necessary to select and send specialized personnel. If the Central Government can announce the new commissioners before October 11, Fu Zhanwen will lead them to Russia immediately. Yesterday, Fu Zhanwen spoke to people about Mo Dehui's situation in Russia, generally saying, "I departed from Moscow on September 18. Because I have a diplomatic passport, the Soviet Union provides special protection according to international practice, and there are no inspections during travel. This time, in addition to delivering important documents, it is also because the delegation originally planned to return home in the autumn, so all cotton clothes were not taken. Now the climate in the Russian capital is cold, and there is an urgent need for winter clothes. Also, when we went abroad before, all the food we prepared was very abundant, but it was only enough for three or four months. The formal meeting is scheduled to open on October 11, but it is difficult to predict when the meeting will be completed. Therefore, we still need to purchase rice, flour, dried vegetables, and other items to avoid shortages. The Soviet Union knows how to treat Mo Quanxian and his party well, and Karakhan is also very respectful. However, whenever Mo Quanxian goes out, the Soviet Union always sends a special commissioner to accompany him in another car. I don’t know if it’s surveillance or protection. When I returned to China, the Special Committee was not formally in contact. Because it was inconvenient during the day, the discussions were held from 10:00 PM to 2:00 or 3:00 AM the next morning. In addition to the Chinese and Russian special commissioners, the secretaries from our side who participated were Cai Yuchen and Wang Huanwen. The two secretaries, Wang Yinchuan and Zhang Mingzhe, attended fewer times. The confidentiality was very strict during the weekly discussions, and no one was allowed to enter or leave. The newly arrived secretary, Wu Zesheng, originally handled personal documents for Mo Quanxian, but recently he was sent to Leningrad to investigate something." (September 28)</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Guangdong Restaurant Joint Ticket Case</h3>
<p>The Restaurant Industry Resumes Business After a Day's Closure. A dispatch from Guangzhou states that after the Department of Finance reduced the banquet donation amount for the Guangzhou restaurant industry, the industry agreed to contract for 610,000 yuan, while the joint ticket system will be temporarily implemented. As a result of mutual concessions between officials and merchants, this case has come to an end. In recent days, the restaurant industry has resumed meetings to discuss the contracting and resumption of business methods. It was immediately decided to submit a report to the Department of Finance, requesting that the banquet donation be returned to the industry for management. The joint ticket issued by the Department of Finance will be printed and used by each store according to the style. On the 27th, after receiving the industry's report, the Department of Finance checked the proposal and found it to be appropriate. It was approved by the department on the same day, and the approval document was sent to the Restaurant Trade Association. After receiving the approval, the association, believing that the case had been completely resolved, convened a general meeting again on the afternoon of the 28th, with more than 100 people attending. Three items were discussed: (1) Since the banquet donation has been recovered for self-management, shares will be opened to collect capital, and the donation will be paid and contracted on the 29th; (2) Since all matters have come to an end, business will be fully resumed on October 1st, and a recovery parade will be held on the 30th; (3) The association will formulate follow-up measures for the joint ticket matter and submit them to the Department of Finance for review and implementation. The Department of Finance's approval of the restaurant industry's measures has been clearly stated in the approval document, with a monthly donation of more than 50,000 yuan, plus a slight collection, and an additional distribution of 25,000 yuan of financial bonds according to the amount of the donation. The approval document from the Department of Finance is as follows: "The report and articles of association are fully understood. Permission is granted to pay an annual donation of 610,000 yuan in silver dollars, with a monthly donation of 50,833 yuan, 3 dimes, and 2 cents in silver dollars. Following the precedent of the current Shangde An Company, the 20% discount on financial treasury bonds will be waived, and a 1% collection will still be charged. Within five months from the date of the donation, an additional 5,083 yuan, 3 dimes, and 3 cents should be paid monthly. Also, in accordance with Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the Detailed Rules for the Reorganization of Financial Treasury Bonds in this province in 1930, financial treasury bonds of half a month's donation amount, 25,416 yuan, 6 dimes, and 6 cents, will be distributed according to the contracted merchant's donation amount. Joint tickets will still be used. In addition to the monthly donation, a monthly salary of 120 yuan in silver dollars will be paid to the supervisor. The merchants will contract in the name of the Guangfu Company. You must comply. Within three days of receiving the document, you must submit one month's donation and half a month's advance donation, along with the reliable donation store, for review and handling. Furthermore, the 20,000 yuan previously paid by the industry should be used as an advance donation. As for the submitted contracting articles of association, they should be reviewed and followed separately. This approval document is stored." It is reported that the restaurant industry has decided to pay the donation today and resume business on October 1st. The restaurant joint ticket turmoil, which has lasted for several months, has thus come to an end. (September 29)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Fengshun Garrison Destroys Bandit Nest</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Shantou states that Chen Junren, the first battalion commander of the Fengshun Training Regiment, and He Naiying, the county magistrate, led two companies of soldiers to the fourth district, Gold City, on the 18th to suppress bandits. On the 22nd, a bandit scout was captured in Gold City. More than ten letters were found on the bandit, communicating with the bandit village and mobilizing the Red Guard to riot in Xiatang. After interrogation, it was planned to tie him up and execute him in Dashaba immediately. However, the scout pleaded repeatedly and confessed that the bandit nest was in Lanwujiao, which was the highest organ of the bandits. Several committee members and Red Army Red Guards were gathered there. More than 300 people who had been shot and axed after being abducted. It is necessary to attack from a certain place and encircle from a certain road to break through. He is willing to lead the military police to set off tonight to attack, etc. Commander Chen obtained the confession and then transferred the Gold City team police and three companies of defense forces at 3:00 AM that night, advancing in two routes. At dawn on the 23rd, they arrived at their destination. The bandits saw them and came out of their nests, resisting stubbornly based on the terrain. The defense forces used mortars to bombard them, hitting them several times. The bandits fought and retreated, collapsing from the mountain opposite Lanwu towards Gaopai, Meikeng, and Kangkeng, and turning towards Shankengwei. After the government troops entered, they set fire to all the bandit nests (all houses of the He surname) and seized countless propaganda materials. Lanwu is located along the mountains, surrounded by obstacles on all sides. It is located at the junction of the first and fourth districts, reaching Chuanlong Baixi in the east, Shanglin Kangkeng Gaopai Shankengwei in the south, Matou in the west, and Huangcaotian Shiping Yehua Datian in the north. In the past ten days, the military police have repeatedly broken through Changbu Buba Lanni Keng. Now the Lanwujiao bandit nest has been broken again. It is thought that the bandits have lost their base, and the area should be peaceful. (September 29)</p>
<h3>Heavy Troops Stationed in Zhangshu, Jiangxi Province, to Suppress Communists</h3>
<p>Gong Bingfan's Troops Arrive in Xun from Han.</p>
<p>Hunan and Jiangxi Armies Jointly Attack the Communists.</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nanchang states that Zhu Mao and Peng Huang's communist bandits, after invading western Jiangxi from Hunan, are mostly still in the Yuanzhou, Fenyi, Lianhua, and Yongxin areas. Only small groups are harassing Xinyu. The 18th Division is still guarding Shanggao and Gaoan, while the New 13th Division and the Garrison Regiment are on alert in Ji'an towards Lian and Yong. Commander-in-Chief Lu regards Zhangshu as the screen of the provincial capital (180 miles from the province, guarding the mouth of the Yuan River into the Gan River, with automobiles connecting to the province). The situation is very important. Therefore, he transferred the 50th Division Yue Sen Brigade stationed in Raozhou to Zhangzhen. The task of encircling and suppressing the bandits in Raozhou and Jingzhen was entrusted to Zhang Chao's regiment. Deputy Division Commander Yue arrived in the province from Rao the day before yesterday and immediately asked Lu Zhang for instructions, and then rushed to Zhangshu to defend. Commander-in-Chief Lu also ordered the Kessel No. 40 aircraft to go to Yuanzhou, Pingxiang, and Lianhua to偵察 the bandit situation. As for the provincial government representative Wang Yinxi and the provincial party committee member Liu Zhenqun, who went to Han to request troops, they have already returned to the province and reported the results of this trip to Lu, which was very satisfactory. Gong Bingfan's division has already departed from Han, and part of it arrived in Xun yesterday. It should be able to reach Jiangxi completely before the Mid-Autumn Festival. Commander-in-Chief Lu also sent people to Xun to entertain everything yesterday. Also, the troops that entered Jiangxi from Hunan to pursue the communist bandits are part of Luo Lin Wang Dongyuan and Li Jue's three divisions, commanded by Luo, divided into Pinglian to closely pursue Zhu Mao's tail. Deng Ying and Zhang Huizhan's two divisions also attacked Yuanzhou Lianhua, attacking from both sides, in order to pacify them in one fell swoop. (October 1)</p>
<h3>Zhang Honglie's Shandong Provincial Construction Plan</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan states that Zhang Honglie, the Shandong Provincial Committee Member and Director of the Department of Construction, arrived in Jinan from Henan last month to take office. Today, he took the oath of office. Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu personally came to supervise the oath. After Zhang took the oath as usual, Han delivered a speech, briefly stating that Comrade Zhang had followed the Premier's revolution for many years in Henan and is now the Henan Provincial Committee Member and Director of the Department of Education, with remarkable achievements. This time, he repeatedly asked the Central Government to transfer him to Shandong, relying on his talents to build a new Shandong, etc. Next, He Siyuan, the Shandong Provincial Committee Member of the Reorganization Committee, delivered a speech on behalf of the Shandong Provincial Party Department, briefly stating that construction is nothing more than water conservancy and roads. Shandong has experienced many wars and is extremely poor, but the people only know how to rely on the heavens for food and do not know how to build, which is why. For example, Shandong has suffered droughts for 580 years since the Han Dynasty. The Yellow River cannot be used and is instead harmed by it. Also, Shandong has the richest coal reserves, and other products such as peanuts, cotton, and tobacco are also produced in large quantities, but none of them can be directly exported. Also, there are many bandits in Shandong, and the people cannot eat even when they have food. All of this is because they do not know how to build. Water conservancy is not developed, transportation is inconvenient, so droughts cannot be prevented, products cannot be sold smoothly, and banditry cannot be suppressed. He believes that under the guidance of Chairman Han, Director Zhang will be able to alleviate these pains. Then, Zhang Honglie delivered a reply, briefly stating that Honglie has no experience in construction and no good plans. Now that he has been in office for a week, he knows that Shandong's construction has a slight foundation. Now, he can only restore the original state first and then slowly plan other things. (1) Restore the automobile road. Shandong's automobile roads originally had more than 100 automobiles. During this war, they were occupied by various armies and taken away by the Jin army. There is not a single one left now. It has now been decided to restore traffic. The provincial government has separately issued letters to various armies, ordering them to return the occupied vehicles. As for the fact that there were too many bureaus set up on each road in the past, with too many employees and large expenses, it has now been decided to carefully reduce the number of bureaus and employees to save expenses and add buy vehicles. It is necessary to use every penny effectively. (2) Restore long-distance telephone. More than 20 counties in Shandong have already installed long-distance telephones. Now that the military affairs have gradually come to an end, and materials and talents are still available, it has been decided to quickly restore them, which will facilitate transportation and also benefit bandit suppression. (3) Plan to rectify water conservancy. The Yellow River in Shandong has more harm than good and cannot be used to irrigate fields, even in Henan. The same is true for other rivers. Now that the military affairs have been roughly settled and finances are difficult, how easy is it to build water conservancy? We must distinguish between easy and difficult tasks and start from promoting benefits and eliminating harms. We must also recruit specialized water conservancy talents from all over the country to plan every day, so as not to waste a penny. As for how the above three points will achieve results in the future, there is no guarantee, but we can only do our best, etc. Finally, Zhang Shaotang, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, delivered a speech, and then a group photo was taken and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Dispute Over Shandong Province's Old Debt to Japan</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan states that during the period when Zhang Huaizhi was the Governor of Shandong in 1917, in order to raise funds for the disbandment of Wu Dazhou's National Protection Army in Zhoucun, the provincial government borrowed 1.5 million yen in Japanese currency from the Jinan branch of the Sino-Japanese Industrial Company in the name of the provincial government, with an annual interest rate of 1% and a term of one year. In 1918, in order to allocate funds for the First Brigade stationed in Shandong directly under the former Beijing government and to supplement the guerrilla forces in the province, the company borrowed another 2 million yen in Japanese currency, changed to a monthly interest rate of 8%, totaling 3.5 million yen in Japanese currency including the previous loan. In March 1920, the monthly interest rate was increased to 8.6%. However, due to repeated changes in the political situation, the loan has not been repaid. Last year, the former provincial government submitted a request to the Central Government, which forwarded it to the Foreign Debt Committee for clearing. The Central Government replied by telegram, stating that since the loan was borrowed in the name of the local government, it should be repaid by the local government. The matter was thus suspended. Now the company is urging repayment very urgently.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The Director of the Department of Finance, Wang Xiangrong, specially requested the provincial government to review and discuss it. After deliberation by the provincial government, it was decided that the provincial government should still submit a request to the Central Government for handling. How to resolve it is still unknown. However, when the loan was borrowed in 1917 and 1918, 3 yen in Japanese currency was only worth 1 yuan in our national currency. Now 1 yen in Japanese currency is worth 1.8 yuan in national currency. This loss is truly appalling. The proposal of the Department of Finance is recorded below so that those who are concerned about foreign debts know that Shandong still has this unclear account: "It has been found that in 1917, the former Shandong Provincial Government borrowed 1.5 million yen in Japanese currency from the Sino-Japanese Industrial Company in the name of the former Beijing government for the disbandment of Wu Dazhou's troops, with an annual interest rate of 1% and a term of one year. In 1918, in order to advance funds for the New Army of the First Brigade directly under the former Beijing government and to supplement the guerrilla forces in the province, the company continued to borrow 2 million yen in Japanese currency, changed to a monthly interest rate of 8%. The above totaled 3.5 million yen in Japanese currency. In March 1920, the monthly interest rate was increased to 8.6%. After five renewals, the interest has been paid off successively. From March 1925, it was renewed for another two years, with the interest rate remaining the same. March 1 and September 1 are the dates for paying interest, and it was agreed that at least 60,000 yen in Japanese currency must be paid each month. After deducting the full amount of interest, the remainder will be used to repay the principal. By 1928, when the Northern Expedition was completed and the Shandong Provincial Government was reorganized, coupled with the May 3 Incident, the aforementioned loan was suspended for more than a year. Later, Yuan, the former Director, came to Shandong. The resident representative of the Sino-Japanese Industrial Company in Shandong, the Japanese Takashi Kiyoshi, repeatedly sent letters requesting that measures be taken to repay the loan and requesting that accumulated subsidies be issued. The former Director Yuan believed that the company's subsidies were issued during the tenure of the two former Directors of the Department of Finance, Guo and Du, because the company was urging repayment very urgently. Therefore, the company's business representative, Zuo Jiu Xianwu, was given the title of consultant to the Municipal Government, and the former Department of Finance paid a monthly subsidy of 500 yuan from the miscellaneous funds stored in the department. Whether or not to recognize it was jointly submitted to the former Provincial Government Committee, which resolved that the provincial government should list the facts and consult with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and forward it to the Foreign Debt Clearing Office for verification and handling. Later, the Central Government replied that the loan should be repaid by the local government on its own initiative. After repeated consultations by letter and telegram, the matter has not been thoroughly resolved. The above is the actual situation of the case of the Sino-Japanese Industrial loan of 3.5 million yen in Japanese currency. Since Xiangrong took office, he has approved the letter from Takashi Kiyoshi, the representative of the company, and met with him a few days ago to explore his intentions. For this case, he will propose discussions immediately. He believes that since the purpose of the loan was to advance military expenses for the former Beijing government, it should still be forwarded to the Central Government by your office and submitted to the Foreign Debt Committee for clearing in order to reduce the province's burden and avoid disputes. However, since the case is of great importance, it is feared that there may not be a solution for a while. However, the company's subsidy of 500 yuan, which should be obtained each month under the name of a consultant to the Municipal Government, seems difficult to deny since there is a contractual relationship. The representative pays particular attention to the subsidy. In order to ease the debt, it is proposed to resolve the subsidy issue first. It has been found that the Municipal Government has long been abolished. It would be more appropriate to give him the title of consultant to the Municipal Government, and the subsidy would be paid from the provincial treasury. Whether this is appropriate or not, the case is jointly submitted for public decision."</p>
<h3>Northeast Sends Personnel to Attend Sino-Japanese Telecommunications Conference</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Shenyang states that at the Sino-Japanese Telecommunications Conference, which is being held in Beijing, all unequal treaties on telecommunications will be proposed for revocation. Due to the geographical relationship between the Northeast and Japan, all of its various industries are subject to Japanese encroachment and control, and telecommunications is one of them. With this opportunity, there are many problems that should be raised at the conference. The National Government ordered the Northeast Transportation Committee to send personnel to participate. The Transportation Committee initially sent Chen Shiying, Director of the Northeast Radio Station, to attend. Later, Chen said that his duties in Shenyang were heavy and he could not leave immediately, so he changed to sending Fan Peizhong, the current Chief of the Business Section of the Harbin Telegraph Bureau, as the attending representative. Fan has served in the telecommunications industry in the Eastern Province for 26 years and has participated in several Sino-Japanese telecommunications relations conferences. He knows everything about the Sino-Japanese telecommunications situation and should be able to complete the task happily. After being dispatched, Fan immediately prepared in Harbin. The day before yesterday, he came to Shenyang to pay his respects to the authorities and ask for instructions. Last night, Zhang Xueliang specially summoned Fan for an audience and told him that this task was important, and he must pay attention to national rights when attending and discussing, and gave him instructions in person. It is reported that Fan will leave for the south on the 30th. (September 29)</p>

<p>Beating Two Bandits to Death and Capturing Four Robbers at Yangmao Bank</p>
<p>In Yangmao Bank, Jingli Township, Fourth District (Kaiyuan Township) of this county, there are sixty to seventy households, mostly farmers. Unexpectedly, around twelve o'clock the night before, more than ten bandits suddenly arrived, speaking in the Jiangbei dialect, armed with handguns, iron rulers, single-edged knives, electric batons, and other weapons. After arriving at the village, they first opened fire as a warning, then broke open the gate of the resident Wu Jipei's house and stormed in. They drove all the men and women of the Wu family to the kitchen and locked them up, with one bandit guarding them with a gun to prevent them from making any noise. The remaining bandits then split up and looted, taking away silver dollars, clothing, and other items estimated to be worth two hundred yuan. After obtaining their loot, the bandits broke into the houses of Wu Chunquan and Chen Songnan, Wu Jipei's left-hand neighbors, and carried out a large-scale robbery, taking away clothing, jewelry, and silver dollars worth about five or six hundred yuan. At that time, the villagers in the area heard the alarm and began to sound gongs to warn others. The bandits, therefore, had no intention of lingering and fled with their loot. At that time, Pu Ronglin, an on-duty patrol officer from the First Detachment of the Ninth Public Security Bureau in Qianqiao Town, about three miles away, faintly heard the sound of gongs and knew that something was amiss. He immediately reported to Inspector Feng Bangyan. Upon receiving the report, Feng immediately led a team of police officers armed with loaded weapons to patrol. They soon spotted a bandit boat coming from the west in the river in a deserted village about half a mile from Qianqiao. Inspector Feng and his men immediately ordered the boat to stop, but the bandits on board, realizing the situation was dire, opened fire on the shore. Inspector Feng also ordered his officers to scatter and lie down in the fields and return fire. After about fifteen minutes of intense fighting, the bandits were unable to withstand the attack and jumped into the river to escape. Two bandits were killed on the spot, one on the boat and one on the shore at the edge of Qianqiao Street. A six-inch handgun, seven bullets, a homemade gun, an iron ruler, and sixty to seventy pieces of stolen clothing were found on the bandit boat. All of these items were immediately taken back to the First Detachment for storage. Inspector Feng interrogated the captured bandits strictly. According to their confessions, they had committed the robbery at Yangmao Bank. Inspector Feng immediately rushed to the homes of Wu Jipei and the other two families in Yangmao Bank to conduct an on-site investigation, then returned to the detachment. Yesterday, he prepared a document and sent the four captured bandits and the eight-year-old child, along with the bandit boat and stolen goods, to the Ninth Public Security Bureau, which was then forwarded by Director Liu to the County Public Security Bureau for investigation. At the same time, Wang Rentang, the head of the Nian Er San Tu in the Fourth District, reported the incident to the county.</p>
<p>Family Tragedy: Three Deaths in Succession</p>
<p>A villager named Cai Jufu, in the Guanshang area of Beixia in the Tenth District of this county, makes a living by farming. His family is considered to be of modest means. Unexpectedly, on August 30, Cai Jufu's elderly mother, Zhu, and his younger brother, Gengshou, suddenly fell ill and died. At the same time, Cai Jufu's second child also suddenly fell ill and died on September 12. Because three of the four members of Cai Jufu's family died within half a month, he believed that the neighbor Chen Jichang had disturbed the feng shui of his ancestral grave by breaking ground. He was extremely grief-stricken and angry, so he grabbed Chen Jichang, slapped him three times, and forced him to leave the corpses exposed for a day and two nights. Afterwards, he moved the coffin to the front of Chen's gate and left it there for six days. Chen Jichang believed that Cai Jufu was using the corpses to extort money, so he immediately filed a petition with the county government to have Cai Jufu arrested and brought to justice.

<p>News of the Anti-Revolutionary Case</p>
<p>Cai Rushan and Hu Xiaorong from Zhouzhuang, and Xu Laowu from Dongwai, were all arrested and detained for anti-revolutionary cases. At 2:00 PM one day, County Magistrate Li, together with Gao Kangfu, Zhong Jianhui, and Meng Yaping from the County Party Rectification Committee, conducted a secret interrogation of Cai and the other two in the county government, and questioned Zhu Shuping and Chen Danhua, who had surrendered. They were then ordered to be detained. Zhu and Chen were released on bail. Furthermore, Xing Songwen, the former head of the First District, was arrested and investigated by the county in accordance with a provincial order for an anti-revolutionary case and was placed in the custody of the Public Security Bureau. The day before, Xing submitted a petition to the county government, earnestly requesting that the investigation be completed as soon as possible so that he could be restored to freedom.

<p>County Magistrate Li Tries to Retain Judge Yang; Jingjiang County Magistrate Wang Jiwu and Judge Yin Chengshen repeatedly clashed over the issue of fine distribution. Yin immediately went to Suzhou with a document to present to Chief Judge Lin of the High Court. County Magistrate Wang also went to Suzhou to report everything. The citizens of the county, Jiang Huanyin and 532 others, jointly accused County Magistrate Wang of embezzling more than 50,000 yuan of public funds, including more than 10,000 yuan, or 30%, from the fines in the tobacco case, which should have been remitted to the judicial accounts of the High Court. This was not made public and was clearly embezzlement. Chief Judge Lin believed that County Magistrate Wang and Judge Yin Chengshen had reached an extreme point and could not cooperate, so he ordered that they be swapped with Judge Yang Ying of Jiangyin. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Li believed that Yang was capable and well-suited to the local conditions, and had telegraphed the High Court to request that the order be rescinded. It is not known whether this will be approved.</p>

<p>Elementary School Teachers Suspend Classes to Demand Salaries</p>
<p>The elementary school teachers in this county have recently been suffering. The end of the lunar year is imminent, and the funds for various schools are four and a half months in arrears. Although Director Chen of the Education Bureau has been working hard to raise money, he has only managed to secure 10,000 yuan on paper, which is not enough to cover the 8,000 yuan shortfall in one month's worth of teaching expenses. As a result, the teachers are greatly alarmed and have unanimously suspended classes in both urban and rural schools today (the 1st) to demand their salaries from the Education Bureau. Director Chen replied that he had no rice to cook and was urgently seeking a solution, but to no avail. It is reported that all the teachers went to the county government this afternoon to petition, but it is not known how County Magistrate Chen responded.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, the farmers Zhou Jiasheng and Zhou Quansheng from Madun Temple, about six li from Xincang, were recently visited by the notorious bandit Peng Jinfa and his gang. They stormed into Zhou's house and demanded silver dollars. It happened that Jiasheng was not at home and met his younger brother Quansheng, whom they tied up and beat. Fortunately, Jiasheng's daughter-in-law, who was sick in bed, shouted, "You want money, just talk nicely, don't hit him!" Upon hearing this, the bandits ordered Zhou to send the money to the Dacheng Temple within three days. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 29th, the bandits suddenly returned to Zhou's house and robbed both brothers' homes, causing significant losses. After the robbery, the bandits went to the home of Shen Abao, also known as Baitou Shen, in Ma Shenfang Qiuhang, and also looted it, burning all his account books for his cattle market business. At that time, it happened that Abao had returned from the Xinmiao autumn market and was met by the bandits, who dug out the dozens of yuan he had hidden for cattle and beat him severely before leaving with a howl. It is said that on the 1st, the bandits sent threatening letters to the Ji and Hu families in Chenjiahe Jijiayu, demanding that they pay the money to the Dacheng Temple by the due date.</p>
<p>Golden Silk Bridge Robbed by Bandits</p>
<p>The Golden Silk Bridge in this county is located near the coast, and there are often hooligans gathering there, gambling and skimming off the top. The Public Security Bureau is unable to reach them in time, causing these people to act without restraint. Suddenly, on the 1st, more than twenty bandits arrived with guns and entered the market, robbing every household and causing significant losses. The county's consolidated tax branch, which is stationed there, was also affected.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Bandit Leader Shi Xichun Arrested</p>
<p>On the 28th of last month, a group of more than ten bandits suddenly gathered in a thatched house in Liugen Bridge, near Sian Town, Huzhou, for a secret meeting, intending to kidnap a wealthy family. This was discovered by the villagers, who reported it to the Third Battalion of the Second Security Regiment stationed in Sian. After receiving the report, Battalion Commander Zhang immediately ordered detectives and soldiers to arrest the bandits, who scattered and fled. Bandit leader Shi Xichun was captured on the spot, and a Bailanglin pistol was found next to him. Zhang Guanzhao, a seven-year-old kidnapped victim, was rescued, and three suspected bandits were captured. They were immediately taken to the Sian Battalion Headquarters for questioning. The bandit Shi Xichun confessed to being a bandit. Yesterday, the battalion sent a team to escort the bandit Shi Xichun and the kidnapped victim Zhang Guanzhao to the Second Regiment Headquarters in this city for review. The three suspected bandits are being held temporarily at the Sian Battalion Headquarters for strict interrogation.</p>
<p>Huzhou's Fields Have a Bumper Harvest</p>

It is reported that the early rice in Changxing, Sian, Xiaofeng, Anji, Wukang, and other places has already been harvested, with yields increasing by one-third compared to previous years. The late rice is now ripening, and the harvest is imminent. Given the current weather, its yield is expected to be even higher than that of the early rice. According to elders, the rice harvest in Huzhou during the Gengyin year forty years ago, although considered a great harvest, was still not as abundant as this year.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Another Robbery Case in Shianqi Garden</p>
<p>On the night of the 29th, more than ten bandits speaking in the local dialect suddenly arrived at the Zheng family in Xiaonan Quanzili. They broke down the door and entered the house, confining all six women, children, and elderly people in one room.

They also robbed two bags of white rice and more than ten chickens and ducks. It is said that the bandits were guided by villagers from the Lishan area.</p>
<h3>Sheng County</h3>
<p>Rampant Banditry in Sheng County</p>
<p>Sheng County is a mountainous area and has always been plagued by bandits. On the 24th of this month, a group of more than forty bandits suddenly appeared near the 28th capital in the western countryside. The bandits were all wearing incomplete military uniforms and carrying wooden-cased guns. They first rushed into the village militia, looting four quick-firing guns and killing and injuring four soldiers. They also robbed Zhang Boqi, the former commander of the Zhenhai Fortress, of four self-defense guns and thousands of yuan worth of gold and silver jewelry. It is reported that the number of bandits has recently gathered to more than two hundred, and they have stormed into more than ten villages in the four districts. The scale of the banditry is unprecedented. Furthermore, according to news from Shaoxing, the military and police have dispatched teams to Sheng County to defend against the rampant bandits. The villages bordering the area are especially panicked. Tangpu Township also had a false alarm the other day. Sun Zhusheng, the village head of Sunkan Village in Tangpu Township, Sheng County, recently received a home report while shopping in Tangpu Market, saying that a bandit letter had arrived, stating that the army (the bandits' self-proclaimed name) would pass through the area on the 1st and requesting that 200 tables of lunch be prepared. As soon as this news spread, the people in the villages near Sunkan and Tangpu were panic-stricken, and some even fled to other places. Fortunately, nothing happened on the 1st, but they had already suffered a false alarm.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Bo Radio Station Notice</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Construction believe that banditry is rampant in remote counties, and transportation is blocked, which is extremely inconvenient. They proposed to the provincial government to establish a shortwave radio station. After deliberation, it was decided to build it in stages. The first stage will be to rush to build it in the four counties of Pingyang, Qingyuan, Taishun, and Jiangxi. The Broadcasting Station will be responsible for the construction. It is learned that after receiving the order, the station immediately sent staff with equipment to install the station. The installation has now been completed and reported to the provincial government yesterday. It has been tested with the Nanjing General Headquarters, the National Government, and other locations, and the results have been very good.</p>
<p>Zhejiang General Chamber of Commerce Schedules Establishment Date.

<p>Special Report</p>
<h3>The Opinion Letter on Tax Revenue Policy from the Ministry of Finance's Gamel Design Committee (Continued)</h3>
<p>The impact on tax revenue of reducing the types of taxes will not necessarily have an adverse impact on revenue. After the number of taxes is reduced, even if it is necessary to increase the tax rate on certain items that are deemed to still require taxation, the tax can be levied on special items that can bear a high tax rate. On the one hand, those who pay other types of taxes can be exempted. This reform is easy to implement. However, it should be noted that the increase in the tax rate should not be carried out rashly. The impact of the tax rate increase on the commodity market must be carefully considered because the state's income is closely related to this impact. Moreover, reducing the number of taxes is also sufficient to increase net income, because simple taxes can save administrative costs. The problem of China's tax administration will be discussed in detail later.</p>
<p>If the above arguments are appropriate, then it is not necessary to seek alternative taxes for those that have already been abolished. However, because there may be occasional errors in determining the tax rate and removing certain items from the tax table, which will be detrimental to finance, in order to avoid this adverse effect, it is not unmanageable to stipulate alternative taxes as a preventive and temporary measure. However, in general, if the aforementioned reform methods can be gradual, then alternative taxes are not necessary.</p>
<p>A Balanced Tax System</p>
<p>After discussing the impact of the tax system on trade and commerce, the following will focus on whether the tax burden is balanced for people of all classes, even if they are not necessarily direct taxpayers, but are ultimately the ones who bear the tax burden.</p>
<p>Most of the taxes currently collected by the national government are borne by consumers of taxable goods. Some people consider this distribution of the tax burden satisfactory, while others believe that the satisfaction of taxes must depend on whether the distribution of the tax burden is in accordance with the people's ability to pay. Many national legislators often say that countries like China, which rely mainly on taxes on goods, should correct or supplement their tax system with direct taxes such as income tax and inheritance tax.</p>
<p>In a memorandum on income tax submitted on September 4, 1929, this committee suggested that China should not adopt a set income tax at the present time. Subsequently, further research on special or partial income tax did not prove that this limited income tax was suitable for adoption. The committee's view is based partly on the nature of income, partly on the current state of Chinese private accounts, and mainly on the administrative nature. Once the conditions that other countries consider suitable for income tax are also seen in China, then China can certainly adopt income tax, but it must still be local and experimental at first.</p>
<p>The committee also believes that China should not adopt an inheritance tax at the present time for similar reasons. This type of tax is based on the family property and inheritance of Western countries, but the situation in China is not the same. The orphans of deceased parents, whether their degree of dependence on this property or their management and use of this property, their status does not change due to the death of their parents. In European and Western countries, the usual reason for collecting inheritance tax is that the inheritors suddenly increase their industry, and their ability to subsidize the country naturally increases, so they can be levied an inheritance tax. However, there is no such stable situation in China, even if there is, it is only a very small number.</p>
<p>Although there is little data on this point, it is sufficient to prove that China's concepts, habits, and industrial registration system regarding families and industries are different from those of Western countries. Even if China implements the collection of inheritance tax today, it will not be very effective.</p>
<p>In addition to the above two types of direct taxes, there is another type of direct tax, namely land tax, which should be discussed. It is appropriate for this stable tax to be collected by local governments, but in fact, the central government of many countries receives a portion of the land tax revenue. The two points regarding land registration and natural appreciation of land tax will be described separately below.</p>
<p>China has never had an appropriate system for registering property rights on land, and there is no precise method for dividing boundaries. To reform this malpractice, it is necessary to measure the land of the whole country, but in view of the current financial situation, this is impossible. However, this work can be carried out gradually, under national supervision, starting first with one or several provinces or several parts of a province.</p>
<p>A clear registration of land industry can be established based on the results of this measurement to achieve the purpose of taxation. At the same time, the taxable value of the industry should be estimated in order to correct the existing land registers, which were mostly made centuries ago and contain many unfair aspects.</p>
<p>At present, most counties and cities in China are expanding and improving public facilities, especially in the national capital. This improvement is sufficient to increase the value of the industry. It is fair for the government to extract a considerable portion of the increased value of this private industry as an improvement cost or part of its cost. The amount of compensation given to private industries for damages caused by municipal improvements should also be part of the aforementioned costs. It does not seem appropriate to discuss the applicable methods of this so-called natural appreciation tax in detail here. In China, the already returned German leased territory of Jiaozhou (Qingdao) is a precedent for this tax. Also, the application of this tax in Guangdong Province was discussed several years ago. This committee believes that the methods and effects of the aforementioned cases should be studied to adopt similar taxes where the situation permits. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Expeditionary Soccer Team Returns to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>｜Yu Hengzhi and Seven Others Returned to Shanghai Yesterday｜Li Huitang is in Hong Kong｜</p>
<h3>Welcome of Relatives and Friends Arriving in Port</h3>
<p>The Chinese Expeditionary Soccer Team, organized by the Lehua Sports Association, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning at 11:00 aboard the French postal ship Porthos, after being abroad for three months. Relatives and friends at sea flocked to the China Merchants General Wharf to welcome them as scheduled. Qiu Feihai, Rong Qizhao, Guang Daozhang, Wu Bangwei, Wang Fudan, Wei Zexian, Li Silian and others were also among them. Suddenly, the ship was in sight, and the team leader, Yu Hengzhi, and others waved to each other. Soon, old friends reunited, talking and laughing. Sun Sijing, Zhou Xianyan, Feng Yun Gu, An Yuansheng, Dai Linjing, Chen Yutian, Chen Jiaqiu, and Zhang Xulong came with the ship. At 2:00 pm, the reporter met Yu Hengzhi again at the Guangdong Club. The reporter asked about the truth of the expedition's termination, the issue of participating in various Westerners Association competitions, and the future progress of Lehua. The points made by Yu Jun are detailed below.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Termination of the Expedition</h3>
<p>The plan to expedition to Europe and America had been in preparation for a long time. Later, it was taken over by Li Silian on his return to China. The outline had been determined, so Lehua began to collect players. In addition to the basic players of the team, it was originally planned to invite players from South China and Singapore to join, forming a team. Unexpectedly, the Hong Kong Football Association denied the addition of South China players in response to inquiries from London. The ambitious plan for the expedition was terminated. The sudden departure and stop of the South China players were actually due to the Hong Kong Chinese and South China Sports Associations. The only way to maintain the association's economy was to rely on the income from the football season. If the famous generals were to leave, the ability to call would be diminished, and the association's affairs would inevitably be hindered, so they had to find a way to obstruct it. It was not selfish, but forced by the environment. However, the Chinese Expeditionary Soccer Team suffered all kinds of blows, resulting in failure.</p>
<h3>Participating in Westerners Association Competitions</h3>
<p>Yu Jun said that Lehua is a member of the Westerners Association and should not be given the assumption of a false word suddenly without prior notice. A letter will be sent to inquire and ask for an explanation of the reason for the suspicion. Before replying, a wait-and-see attitude will be adopted. If a satisfactory reply cannot be obtained, it will be better to sacrifice and withdraw.</p>
<h3>Lehua's Future Progress</h3>
<p>Yu Jun did not have a clear answer to the question of Lehua's future progress, but said that he would wait for the discussion of the association's board of directors. Currently, the team members Dai Linjing, Chen Zhenhe, Feng Yun You, Chen Jiaqiu, and Jiang Shanjing will all serve their alma mater. Those who can serve the team are Zhou Xianyan, Sun Sijing, Li Huitang, An Yuansheng, and Chen Yutian. Li is now in Hong Kong and is scheduled to come to Shanghai on the 9th. Li Ning has returned to his hometown of Shatou, and it is unknown when he will come. Sun Sijing took the Fu Sheng Hao back to Tianjin last night and will return to Shanghai in ten days. Zhang Xiyun, a famous defender from Singapore, is temporarily staying in Shanghai to replace him in his work. According to his statement, if Lehua reorganizes, it will inevitably seek new talent.</p>
<h3>Lehua Will Publish the Process</h3>
<p>Finally, Yu Jun said that the board of directors will publish the process and economic situation of this expedition in the near future. Yu Jun himself will also disclose the details of the termination of the expedition so that the world will not have any doubts.</p>
<h3>The Battle Record of the Nanyang Islands</h3>
<p>During this Chinese Expeditionary Soccer Team's expedition to the Nanyang Islands, they achieved remarkable results in the east and west. A total of twenty-three matches were played, including twelve in Java, three in Saigon, three in Singapore, four in Medan, and one in Kuala Lumpur. There were thirteen wins, six draws, and four losses. A total of sixty goals were scored and thirty-four goals were conceded. Personal achievements: Huitang 24, Linjing 18, Guicheng 6, Yutian 5, Jiaqiu 3, Guangyao 3, and Sijing 1.</p>
<h3>Total Victory in Saigon</h3>
<p>September 23rd Victory over the All-Vietnam Team Eight to One</p>
<p>September 24th Victory over the Saigon Champions Three to Zero</p>
<p>September 25th Victory over the Six Provinces Elite Three to One</p>
<p>The above three battles are the expeditionary force's proudest works, and also the last three of the expedition. Every player recovered their health and had good performances. In the first battle, they defeated the All-Vietnam team by eight to one. Li Huitang scored four goals, Dai Linjing scored one goal, Cao Guicheng scored two goals, and Chen Guangyao scored one goal. In the second battle, they defeated the Saigon champions by three to zero. Huitang scored two goals and Guicheng scored one goal. In the last group, Huitang, Guicheng, and Yutian each scored one goal.</p>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang Sends Personnel to Prepare for the North China Games</h3>
<p>Shenyang Communication. The North China Games this year were originally scheduled to be held in Jinan or Tianjin, but due to the current situation, the Preparatory Committee announced the suspension. Zhang Xueliang heard about this and did not want the China Games to fail after the failure of the Far East Games, believing that it would expose the weakness of the country too much. He ordered the Preparatory Committee member Hao Gengsheng to organize it in Shenyang. Later, because the province was preparing for the Northeast Four Provinces Joint Games, which was approaching, it was difficult to take care of the China Games at the same time in terms of time and preparation, so it was decided not to hold it. Recently, Zhang Xueliang decided that since the Northeast Army had occupied Tianjin and Beijing and the North China territory had returned to the Northeast, the China Games would still be continued during this period. On the 29th, it was decided that Liu Fengzhu, Wang Zhaofan, Sun Guofeng, Li Shutang, Wu Jiaxiang, Feng Yong, Wang Jiexian, Li Jingcheng, Li Xianggeng, Ji Zhenduo, Hao Gengsheng, Wang Huayi, Wang Zhuoran, Hang, Ning Encheng, etc., would be the Liaison Committee members in Liaoning for the Preparatory Committee of the North China Games. Each committee member has scheduled to meet at the Provincial Education Association on the afternoon of the 30th to discuss all preparations. However, this Northeast Four Provinces Joint Games is an innovation in the Northeast and has been in preparation for many days. If the China Games are prepared at the same time, there will be many inconveniences in fact. It is heard that the relevant parties have decided that all athletes from various places who should participate in the China Games will be invited by the Four Provinces Joint Games to join the Joint Games and will no longer hold a separate China Games after the event.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Plans to Establish Grain Storage</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs forwarded to the Municipal Government for approval the fact that this year's rice harvest is abundant and the new rice is coming onto the market, which will inevitably lead to a surge in supply. At that time, the price of rice will inevitably fall. Currently, the new rice has not yet flooded the market, and the price of rice has already fallen to about sixteen yuan. According to the observations of most people, there is still the possibility of further decline. People are generally happy to hear that grain is cheap, but they do not know that when new grain comes out, the price of rice is too low, which is also harmful. At a time when everything is expensive, farmers cannot make ends meet. In the coming year, rice cultivation will inevitably switch to more profitable crops, which will reduce grain production. When unscrupulous merchants see that the price of rice is low, they believe that there is no profit to be made domestically, and they often smuggle it abroad to raise the domestic grain price. The result is almost the same as forming a situation where expensive rice is imported in famine years and cheap rice is exported in bumper years. The only way to remedy this is to immediately raise huge sums of money to be purchased by the government when rice is cheap to regulate the market and keep prices balanced. This is the only way to resist the cunning schemes of unscrupulous merchants to destroy the people's food supply and ensure long-term food security. It is reported that the Bureau of Social Affairs received instructions from the Municipal Government to approve the consultation of the Ministry of the Interior and the order of the Executive Yuan. At the 242nd meeting of the Central Political Conference, Committee Member Chen Guofu proposed a plan to establish grain storage and ordered that it be examined and reported. According to the resolution of the Food Committee, the funds for grain storage in counties and cities should be divided and a fund of one million yuan should be raised to handle grain storage. The Municipal Government was requested to first organize a fundraising committee for the warehouse fund and raise one million yuan within three months. This is because the city has a large population and requires a large amount of food. The original warehouses have long been rebuilt into civilian houses and rented out. The funds for grain storage over the years have also been insufficient. Moreover, it is jointly managed by the city and county, and has not yet been divided. Now, for the sake of storing up for famine relief, it is necessary to raise ample funds. The city's famine relief fund of 200,000 yuan has been finalized, but due to the city's financial difficulties, it must be allocated within ten years, which is a drop in the bucket and difficult to help. Therefore, the Bureau of Social Affairs has made this proposal.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Bans Old Calendars</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government, considering that recently peddlers in the concessions have been hawking old calendars from the twentieth year of the Republic, hindering the promotion of the national calendar, has specially requested the Special District Local Court to instruct the Public Works Department of the Bureau to strictly prohibit such sales. The original letter stated, "Regarding the letter No. 1396 from the Secretariat of the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, stating that the Third District Party Department under the committee requested that the Municipal Government be consulted to negotiate with the concession authorities to ban peddlers from hawking old calendars from the twentieth year of the Republic to uphold the law, etc., which has been submitted and approved by the Standing Committee and forwarded to the Municipal Government, etc., accordingly, we are enclosing a copy of the submission and sending it to your esteemed government for review and handling, and a reply is requested." It is understood that unscrupulous merchants are privately printing old calendars in the concessions and enticing peddlers to hawk them along the streets, which is a violation of the prohibition and should be strictly prohibited. In addition to replying to the letter, we are enclosing a copy of the submission and sending it to your esteemed court to instruct the Public Works Department of the Bureau to investigate and handle, and a reply is requested.</p>
<h3>Weihaiwei Postal Service Now Taken Over by Chinese Postal Service</h3>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Federation's Methods to Assist in the Xiao Case</h3>
<p>Telegram Calling on All Circles to Unite and Rise Up</p>
<p>Boycott the Java Shipping Company</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation yesterday telegraphed to party departments at all levels, governments at all levels, newspapers, organizations, support associations for the Xiao case in various ports, the Yixing Shanghai Alumni Association, and the Nanjing Central District Experimental School, stating that the chief mate and second mate of the Java Shipping Company's ship Tjibadak forcibly defiled Ms. Xiao Xin'an, a Chinese female teacher, and more than a month has passed, and the humiliation has not been avenged. For the honor of the entire nation, for the dignity of the entire country, for the personality of all female compatriots, and for the dignity of female teachers, our association must loudly appeal to compatriots at home and abroad to urgently provide assistance. In addition to urging the diplomatic authorities to seriously negotiate, it is urgent to unite and rise up to boycott all ships of the Java Shipping Company (Java　Chin</p>
<p>aJapanLuyn) as a diplomatic backing. We will never stop until the chief mate and second mate of the Tjibadak are severely punished, the Dutch government officially apologizes to our nation, and Ms. Xiao receives reasonable compensation. The chief mate and second mate dared to indulge in bestial desires towards Ms. Xiao because they no longer recognized the Chinese as human beings. Therefore, they did not dare to approach Europeans and Japanese, but went straight to Ms. Xiao, who was unfortunately born a Chinese, thinking that the Chinese are a lowly race, with no sense of national honor, lacking national consciousness, pursuing selfishness, and embracing individualism as the public creed of lowly Chinese. Who would be willing to lift a finger to help if Ms. Xiao was insulted? Therefore, they dared to call their kind and force Ms. Xiao to commit suicide by taking poison again and again. Our association does not recognize that the Chinese have such inferior nature and deeply wishes to follow all circles to avenge this strange humiliation of being looked down upon and forcibly defiled. Who does not have a wife and daughter? Who would willingly suffer humiliation? If we do not help the Xiao case, how can we know that the next person defiled will not be our own wife and daughter? If we do not punish the thieves, what restraints will the thieves who imitate them have in the future? Compatriots, unite and we will be strong, divide and we will be weak. Helping Xiao is helping ourselves, helping others is helping ourselves. From today onwards, do not take Java Company ships, do not carry Java Company goods, do not load Java Company passengers and cargo, do not publish Java Company advertisements, and do not publish news of Java Company ships entering and leaving the port. Let the Dutch recognize that the Chinese are not beasts, and let the world recognize that the Chinese are human beings, to preserve national honor, to preserve national dignity, to fight for female personality, and to maintain the dignity of female teachers. It all depends on this. We are telegraphing with grief and indignation, and we look forward to hearing from you. The Overseas Chinese Federation bows, Jue (12 Park Road, Shanghai)</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Prepares to Receive American Far East Economic Survey Mission</h3>
<p>The mission is expected to arrive in Shanghai around November 30th. The British Far East Economic Survey Mission is currently led by Sir Thompson, former president of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, to investigate the commercial situation of Britain in China and Japan, and the methods to promote trade. Attached is a cotton industry survey mission, which is specifically for investigating the development of the British cotton industry in the Far East and the methods to promote the industry. The survey mission is expected to arrive in Shanghai around November 30th and will conduct investigations in Shanghai and surrounding areas for about one month. They will first go to the capital to visit the National Government, and then conduct a thorough investigation in the Shanghai area. Some members of the mission will go to Hankou from Shanghai for investigation. In the second month, the mission will conduct investigations in Beiping, Tianjin, Liaoning, Harbin, Dalian, and other places. In the third month, they will conduct investigations in South China. The Municipal Government of this city yesterday received a letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reporting the above news. Considering that the survey mission is organized by well-known figures in the British business community, and this visit to China to investigate the economic, commercial, and cotton industry situation of Britain in the Far East is closely related to the development of our country's international trade, the Municipal Government has ordered the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to make proper preparations for reception.</p>
<h3>Mayor Zhang Sends Telegram to Senior Civil Official Gu</h3>
<p>Please Convey to Government Officials</p>
<p>My Desire to Resign from China Merchants Bureau Committee</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang Yuejun was previously appointed by the National Government as a member of the China Merchants Bureau Reorganization Committee and designated as the chairman. He respectfully telegraphed the National Government last month to resign, but subsequently received instructions from the National Government expressing deep trust and sincerely retaining him. Upon hearing the news in Shenyang, Mayor Zhang telegraphed the National Government again on the Eastern day of this month to express his resignation for the second time, with great determination, expressing that he would never take office no matter what. The content of the telegram has been seen in another article, and the wording is extremely sincere, coming from the heart, and is not a feigned modesty. Still fearing that the National Government would retain him again, he specially telegraphed Senior Civil Official Gu of the National Government Civil Affairs Office on the Winter day to express his sincerity, requesting him to convey to the government officials that his resignation should be approved as soon as possible. Here is a summary of the telegram: "Senior Civil Official Gu Xiangqin of the Civil Affairs Office of the National Government in Nanjing, the National Government has ordered me to serve concurrently as a member of the China Merchants Bureau Committee. I really do not have the ability to handle this matter concurrently, and I especially do not want one person to serve concurrently in two unrelated matters. I telegraphed to resign last month but was not approved, and instead received encouragement, which has increased my anxiety. I am telegraphing again to resign and am returning the appointment letter to Shanghai. I hope that you will convey my words to the government officials and approve my resignation as soon as possible, so that another capable person can be appointed to avoid important matters being suspended for a long time and hindering progress. If I resign again and again, it will only cause trouble and ultimately achieve nothing. I respectfully ask for your understanding. Zhang Qun kowtows on the Winter day."</p>
<p>"To the National Government in Nanjing, I previously heard the order to reorganize the China Merchants Bureau Committee and telegraphed to resign on the Respect day of last month. Recently, I received news from Shanghai that I respectfully reviewed the government's instructions on the Tolerance day to retain me and encourage me. I am filled with gratitude and anxiety. I think that I have dedicated myself to the party and the country and have never dared to shirk my responsibilities. I have never dared to avoid anything on the revolutionary path. However, the Shanghai Municipal Government and the China Merchants Bureau are both important matters and have their own responsibilities. I think that my talent and energy are insufficient to handle both at the same time. In all my management and planning, I am cautious of being distracted. Moreover, the position of chairman of the China Merchants Bureau Reorganization Committee is crucial and affects the future of the shipping industry. My resignation comes from sincerity, and I hope you will understand my sincere intentions. Rather than making mistakes in the future, it is better to be cautious now. Therefore, I am telegraphing again to resign, and I hope that you will approve my resignation quickly. Zhang Qun kowtows on the Eastern day."</p>

<h3>The Zhenru Radio Station Will Soon Be Completed</h3>
<p>The French-built Radio Station Will Also Be Completed Soon</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that, according to an employee of the American Radio Corporation in Sassoon House, the construction of the Zhenru Radio Station will soon be completed, so that Shanghai and San Francisco can communicate by radio telegraph. The Zhenru Radio Station specializes in transmitting, and there is also a radio station in Liuhang that specializes in receiving. The two radio stations are connected by 24 pairs of lead-covered wires. The automatic mechanism for transmission and reception is controlled by the telegraph room of the Sassoon House head office. The equipment is all the latest type. The telegrams sent from Shanghai can be received in San Francisco immediately. Currently, telegrams sent from Shanghai to the United States must be routed through the Philippines, so it takes two hours to be transmitted. Now that direct communication is possible, it will only take 30 minutes, and the cost can be reduced. This project was contracted by the National Government with the American Radio Corporation, which invested in the construction of the station and undertook the operation for ten years, after which the government would own it. In addition, the French-built radio station in Zhenru, which uses French equipment, will also be completed soon and can be put into operation before the end of this year.</p>
<h3>Further Postponement of the Jinliyuan Case Execution</h3>
<p>Gao Shuo Visited the French Consul to Resolve the Jinliyuan Wharf Case: The deadline set by the French Consulate has passed again, but the reply from Paris has not yet arrived. General Manager Li of the China Merchants Bureau is eager to resolve this case. Yesterday, he specially invited lawyer Gao Shuo to visit the French Consul General to discuss the matter at the French Consulate for a long time in the morning. As a result, the French Consul General stated that the responsibility for the delay lies with the church and agreed to notify the Consulate General immediately that the execution would be postponed again to allow both parties to have an opportunity to consult. Mr. Gao immediately expressed his gratitude and the meeting ended satisfactorily.</p>
<h3>Fourth Day of National Anti-Drug Week</h3>
<p>Anti-Drug Family Day</p>
<p>Today is the fourth day of the Seventh National Anti-Drug Week, namely Anti-Drug Family Day. The purpose of this day is to promote women's anti-drug movement and focus on publicity in the family aspect. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Anti-Drug Family Day Measures: A. Significance: Opium and drugs have a profound impact on families, destroying family finances, undermining family morality, and endangering family happiness. Various incidents are innumerable. In every country, compatriots have become addicted to opium, leading to family disintegration. It is imperative to eliminate opium and transform families first, ensuring that there are no such dregs in the house. B. Purpose: How to improve the family and avoid the scourge of opium and drugs? The primary work should be to promote health knowledge, avoid bad habits, adopt proper entertainment, and pay attention to anti-drug education. If the anti-drug wind spreads throughout the country, the scourge of opium will be fundamentally eliminated, and families will gain unlimited happiness. C. Measures: (1) Hold a family anti-drug carnival. (2) Female students give speeches and investigate the facts of family smoking disasters. (3) Organize women's anti-drug propaganda association. (4) Publish a special issue on women's anti-drug campaign. (9) Hold a grand anti-drug oath-taking ceremony for women.</p>
<h3>Outline of Anti-Drug Family Day Propaganda</h3>
<p>Opium is a poisonous substance that destroys the country and the people. The cruelty of floods and beasts is less than that of opium. It is the great enemy of mankind, the evil of society, and the destroyer of families, harming people's livelihood, endangering the race, and impoverishing the country and the people. Therefore, if it is not eliminated, the disasters will be endless. In recent years, the anti-drug movement has reached the clouds and shaken China and foreign countries, making the people of the country thoroughly aware and rising up together to put it out. It is very fortunate. People who are addicted to smoking are confused, do not engage in proper work, and indulge in smoking all day long. The rich become poor and eventually lose everything, their wives and children suffer from cold and hunger, their family business is destroyed, and their lives are extremely difficult. However, the smoking addiction still cannot be quit, and they become robbers and beggars. Moreover, once a smoking addiction is developed, the poison enters the bones, and the harm of fertility and inheritance is infinite. Other important issues such as family education are destroyed because of this. Even with a good wife and virtuous mother, there is nothing they can do to help, and they can only watch the happy family turn into a cruel hell. We hope that our female compatriots will think deeply and take precautions, and make a firm determination to refuse drugs and have a family. We will embrace the ambition to put out the scourge of smoking and achieve the ultimate goal of eliminating it. (1) Advocate family anti-drug movement. The sin of opium is as described above, and its scope and depth of harm have become unmanageable. Therefore, to solve this problem, it is necessary to awaken women across the country and strive to promote the family anti-drug movement. Opium poison is based in the family, where it parasitizes, breeds, grows, and spreads to all aspects of society. Therefore, the foundation of the anti-drug movement must be established in the family, so that the general mothers know the importance of anti-drug education and pay attention to their children. In their childhood, they should be taught about the harm of opium and narcotic drugs, which are the roots of bad physique, loss of intelligence, moral decline, national destruction, and racial extinction, and how to eradicate them, so that they can understand the meaning of anti-drug education early and vow not to plant, transport, sell, or use opium and all narcotic drugs throughout their lives, and join the anti-drug movement anytime and anywhere. They should also tell their sons, mothers admonish their daughters, brothers encourage their younger brothers, and sisters encourage their younger sisters to make the whole family move to avoid being contaminated with opium and narcotic drugs and work hard. In this way, the family can be promoted to society, and it will be able to shake the power of smoke poison and fundamentally shake it. I hope that the female compatriots of our country will spread this goal and work hard to make the way to opium and other narcotic substance users is cut off. The opium, cultivation, transportation, and sale events that supply this need will also be cut off forever. (2) Organize a family anti-drug propaganda association. In everything, division leads to weakness and unity leads to strength. It is the same with the anti-drug movement. In order to achieve the goal, it is necessary to gather many like-minded people and carry out organized movements and conduct family anti-drug propaganda association for a united progress, so that women in general can: (1) understand the poison and harm of opium and narcotic drugs, and the family is the first to suffer. (2) Recognize that the anti-drug movement is a top priority, and strive to participate in the anti-drug movement to eradicate drugs and transform families. (3) Implement family anti-drug education, promote anti-drug health knowledge, investigate the real situation of family smoking disasters, and protect children from smoke poisoning. (4) Determine to refuse drugs and work together at any time and place to improve the family and eradicate drugs. Then the future of our country's anti-drug movement has great hopes.</p>

<h3>Plan to Promote the Women's Anti-Drug Movement</h3>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association considers opium to be more devastating than raging floods and fierce beasts. The first to bear the brunt are families. Those addicted to smoking become mentally confused and abandon their proper occupations. Wealthy families easily become impoverished, and the poor are more likely to fall into despair. They pawn everything, neglecting their wives and children, leading to ruin, which is the first harm. With the family business ruined and daily sustenance difficult, the pain is exacerbated by the addictive nature of smoking. Driven to desperation, they resort to theft and deception, their character declines, and their morals are corrupted, which is the second harm. Once the smoking habit is deeply ingrained, the poison penetrates the bones, and it is passed down to future generations, causing endless harm, which is the third harm. Moreover, the sins are countless. Considering that women are essential members of the family, managing internal affairs and educating children, they occupy crucial positions in the home. Therefore, to restore family happiness and maintain family joy, it is especially important to promote the women's anti-drug movement. Once an anti-drug atmosphere is established in the home and anti-drug seeds are sown, no matter how cruel the drug is, what can it do to us? The Association has specifically formulated ten measures, inviting female compatriots across the country to promote and implement them, including: (1) Holding family anti-drug meetings, with local areas holding family anti-drug meetings organized and presided over by women; (2) Organizing family anti-drug propaganda teams, with local women's organizations and girls' schools forming family anti-drug propaganda teams to conduct door-to-door anti-drug propaganda; (3) Investigating the actual situation of family drug disasters, forming joint investigation teams to go to various places to investigate the actual situation of families tragically harmed by opium, leading to depravity; (4) Organizing children's anti-drug groups, with women's circles in various places initiating the formation of children's anti-drug groups, recruiting children from various families to join the publicity efforts and reject drugs for life; (5) Conducting written propaganda, with women's organizations in various places publishing anti-drug opinions in various newspapers from time to time, as well as works on the anti-drug movement and various women's issues; (6) Rejecting marriage with smokers, with women's circles and female students in various places uniting to form groups, vowing never to marry those who use drugs or are related to drugs, as a passive resistance; (7) Forming smoke paraphernalia destruction teams, with women in various places organizing groups of people, imitating the American women's temperance movement by chopping up wine tools and barrels, forming smoke paraphernalia destruction teams. For those who smoke at home, the smoking paraphernalia should be taken out and destroyed; (8) Holding anti-smoking petitions, with women's organizations in various places putting forward opinions on banning smoking, submitting them to local authorities, and requesting implementation; (9) Organizing women's anti-drug comradeships, uniting women from all walks of life, separately organizing women's anti-drug comradeships, and jointly seeking family improvement; (10) Promoting the sale of anti-drug monthly magazines, holding family anti-drug comrades meetings, and distributing them when investigating family drug situations in various places, while taking the opportunity to promote the sale of anti-drug monthly magazines.</p>
<p>Preparing for Anti-Drug Speech Competition. The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association holds a student anti-drug speech and essay competition once a year. This year, it was originally planned to be held during the anti-drug cycle, but due to the considerable time required for preparation, it was postponed.

It is reported that the speech competition, due to geographical reasons, will be held in Shanghai as well as in local branches in various provinces and cities.

<p>Letter to Schools: Respected Sirs, the spread of opium is deeply entrenched, and its harm continues to escalate. This is a hidden concern for the nation and its people. Only by relying on the strength of the entire population can we carry out an eradication movement. The academic community is the backbone of society, and many support and promote the anti-drug movement. To arouse the academic community's interest in anti-drug efforts and to thoroughly eliminate drugs, the Association holds a speech competition once a year. It has been held for several sessions. This year, it was originally scheduled to be held during the national anti-drug cycle, but due to the complexity of affairs and the considerable time required for preparation, it was specifically postponed. The Association has stipulated the speech competition regulations and rules, as well as registration procedures. We hereby enclose the complete set and request that you check and collect them. We also ask that your school prepare to participate in order to achieve significant results. We earnestly pray for this. We deeply anticipate your reply. Sincerely, The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association.</p>
<h3>Convening Joint Meeting of Bookstores</h3>
<p>Regarding the inclusion of anti-drug materials in textbooks, the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association submitted a proposal to the First National Anti-Smoking Conference, which was passed. To implement this proposal, the Association plans to invite key personnel from major bookstores in Shanghai to hold a joint meeting to discuss implementation methods. It is reported that the measures it plans to submit to the joint meeting are as follows: (1) Send letters to bookstores across the country, according to the following principles, to include anti-drug teaching materials in primary and secondary school textbooks; (2) All textbooks that are compiled, reprinted, or newly compiled should immediately include the following teaching materials; (3) For textbooks that have already been published, supplementary teaching materials should be printed and attached to the book for supplementary teaching; (4) Civics textbooks: (A) In the hygiene section, the composition of opium should be analyzed in detail and how it affects physiology, so that students thoroughly understand that the harm of drug addiction is even greater than that of arsenic poisoning. Once committed, it will be harmful for life; (B) In the ethics section, in addition to explaining drug addiction, it is also appropriate to list examples of opium addicts who often indulge day and night, inhaling smoke and satisfying their addiction, often leading to laziness, career abandonment, and personality decline; (C) In the legal system section, add that those who indulge in opium and privately sell opium violate Article X of the criminal law and should be subject to legal sanctions; (D) In the economics section, in the family economics chapter, explain the methods of financial management, that smoking consumes a lot of money, and that a middle-class family can easily go bankrupt. Harming oneself is a small matter, but breaking the law and going bankrupt is even more serious. Good citizens should pay close attention to this. (1) Primary and secondary school history and geography textbooks should include anti-drug teaching materials. In addition to the original national education teaching materials, special attention should be paid to the meaning of anti-drug efforts so that students understand that the anti-drug movement is a form of patriotism; (2) Natural sciences: (A) In the botany aspect, the state, appearance, and nature of the poppy should be added; (B) In the chemistry aspect, the experiment of analyzing drug addiction should be added; (3) In the Chinese language section, select several of the best anti-drug essays written by doctors and have students study them, and have students write anti-drug essays.</p>
<p>Churches Unite Against Drugs. There are quite a few churches in the city. Yesterday, the Association sent personnel to carry various promotional materials to various churches for posting, and asked the churches to add anti-drug speeches during the worship service on the fifth day.</p>
<p>Statistics on Oaths. The Association pays great attention to anti-drug oaths every time it holds a campaign. During this anti-drug week, the Association plans to hold a national oath-taking ceremony. All printed materials include a type of oath form. According to the Association's statistics, during the three days, more than 3,000 representatives of the public in the city took oaths in person at various gatherings. According to the Association's statistics, 1,300 people in the city filled out oath forms and sent them to the Association in three days. Because the campaign only started three days ago, many oath forms from other places have not yet arrived. As of today, only about 800 copies have been counted.</p>
<p>Electric News. To achieve widespread publicity, the Association consulted with the Wenlin Advertising Company in the city to add the words "7th Anti-Drug Week" to the current advertising on the roof of the New World on Nanjing Road, which was approved by the company. The Association also sent personnel to various amusement parks to widely post promotional materials, and continues to post them on various roads.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Assists with Propaganda. The Association distributed books and slogans to the city's Public Security Bureau and various district offices, requesting that they be posted for publicity. The Navy Headquarters also approved the dispatch of aircraft to distribute leaflets in the air today.</p>
<h3>Protest Against Inspection of Japanese Ship</h3>
<p>The Japanese Qing Company's Luoyang Maru ship sailed from Hankou to Shanghai last month. When passing the Wusongkou, the Wusong Fortress Headquarters received a telegram in advance, knowing that bandits had boarded the ship in Jiujiang, posing as passengers, trying to mix into Shanghai. Therefore, it sent ten soldiers, taking a small boat to approach the ship, and advising it to stop entering the port and wait for inspection. After five minutes of searching, it would be allowed to sail to Shanghai. However, the Japanese shipowner believed that armed soldiers should not search Japanese merchant ships. After arriving in Shanghai, he immediately reported to the Japanese Deputy Representative Mitsuaki Kageyama. Yesterday (2nd), the Acting Consul General Mio Akio lodged a protest with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, demanding that sufficient attention be paid in the future to ensure that the same incident does not happen again.</p>
<h3>Executive Committee Meeting of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Fourth Session</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce held its fourth regular meeting of the Executive Committee at 4 p.m. yesterday. More than ten people attended, including Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jiyu, Zhu Wenqi, Lu Fengzhu, Gu Xinyi, Wu Zhihao, Fang Jiaobo, Chen Songyuan, and Lu Qiusheng. Chairman Wang Xiaolai presided over the meeting. After the formalities, Secretary Yan Esheng announced the resolutions of the third regular meeting, which were passed. After reporting on various letters, the following cases were discussed: (1) Discussion on the case of following the method of settling accounts according to the national calendar at the end of this year. First, the Secretary reported that the Association received a letter from the Hangzhou Municipal Cultural Association, stating that settling accounts at the end of the national calendar this year may be hindered. A flexible method was proposed to request an extension of one and a half months to solicit the Association's opinions. It was stated that following the national calendar is a national government order, and the government specially approved a one-month delay last year. It is impossible to request an extension this year. After detailed discussion by the members present, it was resolved that the settlement of accounts at the end of this year should be strictly in accordance with the national calendar. The Association will notify the industries to prepare in advance and announce to the southern part of the city to comply. (2) Discussion on the Association's finances. It was resolved to actively collect membership fees. The members will be responsible for persuading the guilds to pay the fees to the Association before the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Work Relief Progress in Ninghai County, Shaoxing, Zhejiang</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jiesheng Association previously received a letter from Sun Yinting, the Director of Work Relief in Ninghai County, Shaoxing, Zhejiang, reporting that the work relief for seawalls in Gudu, Xiadu, and Xuepo was progressing. During the heavy rain on the night of August 27, the three combined villages were flooded, causing 61 seawalls along the coast to collapse, damaging 13,000 mu of Ning rice, and affecting more than 5,000 people, cutting off their livelihoods. The Director inspected the work relief and calculated that the original budget needed to be increased threefold, which was previously reported. The Director carefully calculated again and again and reduced the number. Construction of the seawall and water storage cannot be done without tens of thousands of dollars. The Ningbo Ruiyu Zhuang Zhonghang has remitted 25,000 yuan for work relief. To complete the project, there is still a large difference. Work relief is different from emergency relief. If work relief is done well, there will be no floods and harvests can be abundant every year. It is really a win-win situation. At this moment of extreme urgency, good relationships should be established, and blessings will be immeasurable. This is what is expected of fellow philanthropists in Jiangsu and Zhejiang.</p>
<h3>Inspection and Registration of Rice and Grain Will Be Handled by the Central Government</h3>
<p>The Request to Set Up an Inspection Office in Jiangsu Province Was Rejected</p>
<p>The Municipal Government of this city previously received a report from the Shanghai County Government, stating that it was ordered by the province to establish a rice and grain inspection office in the city. It planned to find a suitable location in Nanshi and asked for filing and assistance. Since the registration of food transfer and export in this city has been handled by the Social Affairs Bureau and has been resolved by the Central Political Conference, the inspection and registration of food throughout the country should be handled by the Central Government in the future to unify authority. Therefore, should the proposal of the Shanghai County Government to set up an office in this city to inspect rice and grain be approved? After forwarding it to the Central Government for verification, the Executive Yuan forwarded it to the Ministry of Agriculture and Minerals for deliberation and reply, stating that the inspection and registration of food need not be entrusted to local agencies to unify authority. After receiving the order from the Municipal Government, the Secretariat has notified the Shanghai County Government for verification. The previous telegrams from various newspapers in this city, stating that the Shanghai Municipal Government's request to set up an inspection office was rejected, is a misunderstanding of this case.</p>
<h3>Inspection Report of Zhejiang Industrial Bank</h3>
<p>Fourth Time</p>
<p>The issuance of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank is completely separate from the business aspect, with sufficient preparation. On the 3rd of this month, accountant Yan Kejian checked the cash reserve and found that it was over 60%, and the guarantee was under 40%. The total numbers are as follows: The total amount issued by this bank is 3,551,457.5 yuan, of which the reserve is 2,314,657.5 yuan in cash and 1,236,800 yuan in guarantee. The amount used by the same bank is 3,230,000 yuan, of which the reserve is 1,938,000 yuan in cash and 1,292,000 yuan in guarantee.</p>
<h3>The Children's Welfare Association Receives and Sends Disaster Children</h3>
<p>The Chinese Children's Welfare and Relief Association, due to the continuous natural disasters in Shandong and the impact of the war, has many helpless children who have lost education and care. It specially requested approval from the Ministry of Railways to issue free train tickets and send Zhang Yueru, an administrative officer, to Tai'an and other counties yesterday to conduct on-the-spot investigations and collect disaster children to take to Shanghai and keep them in the Shanghai Children's Welfare and Education Institute for education. In addition, eight disaster children who were successfully educated in Tengxian and Taian in 1917 were sent back to their original places to reunite with their families. It is reported that when the disaster children left the institute with Zhang, the teachers and students were reluctant to part and said goodbye in tears, enduring the pain. Because the institute is well managed, the teachers and students are like fathers and mothers, and the classmates are like brothers and sisters. Once separated, there is an unspeakable pain.</p>

<p>After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it resolved to implement the Gregorian calendar and repeatedly issued orders to public security, education, and other bureaus in various provinces and cities, strictly prohibiting the circulation of the old calendar to emphasize the importance of timekeeping. However, general booksellers only seek profit and disregard the law. They take advantage of the concession areas where our country's police power does not extend to reprint these obsolete calendars and secretly sell them. Now that time flies, and the coming year is approaching, the bookstores and printing houses that are reprinting obsolete calendars are all starting their work. Director Yuan of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, in view of this, believes that if a large-scale investigation is carried out at this time, and once discovered, all copies are confiscated and destroyed, then obsolete calendars may not be seen among the people again next year. Therefore, he specially commissioned Inspector Ge Jingxuan of the bureau to investigate whether bookstores and printing houses in the city are secretly printing such materials. If found, they will be punished for propaganda of reaction, according to the central government's orders. In recent days, Inspector Ge has found four companies that are privately printing obsolete calendars: Tang Yunji Bookstore at No. 227 Siwen Lane, Datong Road; Zhang Peizhang Bookstore at No. 152 and 153 Nanchengdu Road; Huachang Printing House at No. 554 Beichengdu Road; and a certain printing house at No. 2093 Xingyu Lane, Haining Road. However, all of them are located in the Public Concession area. Therefore, at 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, he personally went to the Political Department of the General Police Station to request assistance in the search. The director of the department and Detective Pan Bi went to the Xinzha Police Station under their jurisdiction and dispatched detectives Zhang Jinlong, Yuan Xizhong, and Dong Xueyun to Tang Yunji, Zhang Peizhang, and Huachang. They saw that the obsolete calendars that had been printed were countless, both bound and unbound, numbering no less than hundreds of thousands. It would not be possible to transport them all back to the police station in a short time. They ordered their owners Tang A'gen, Wang Shaoshan, and Hua Wenbin not to move or hide the obsolete calendars and to await official disposal. They only took a small portion of the bound copies. The contents included all kinds of superstitious events, spells, and scriptures from the past, which were all published at the beginning. They were bizarre and can be said to be a collection of superstitions. The most absurd and outrageous thing was that the portraits of reactionary figures such as Yan Xishan, Feng Yuxiang, Li Bai and others were listed alongside the photos of the many officials of the National Government, which was tantamount to showing the public in an invisible way that the difference between right and wrong, and the boundary between the wise and the foolish, was indistinguishable. Then, they went to Xingyu Lane to search with detectives from the Huishi Police Station. Unexpectedly, the printing house was opened by the Japanese. They relied on extraterritorial rights as a talisman and refused the search. Although Detective Ge and others knew that the printing house had printed obsolete calendars, they were unable to exercise their powers and could do nothing. Yesterday morning, the police sent a portion of the obsolete calendars copied from the remaining three places to the Special District Local Court. Judge Shen of the Summary Court interrogated the search situation and ordered a change of date, awaiting a warrant to summon Tang A'gen and the other three to the court for further questioning, and ordered the police to search and send all the obsolete calendars printed by the three companies, Tang Yunji, etc., to the court for review.</p>
<h3>Fires in Zhabei and Nanshi Claimed Human Lives</h3>
<p>Zhabei... One Woman Died</p>
<p>Nanshi... One Girl Died</p>
<p>Xibao'an Road: A fire broke out at around 2:45 p.m. yesterday at the Xiexingli No. 82, Xinyi Spectacle Workshop, near the Yanjiage Vegetable Market on Xibao'an Road, Zhabei, and was extinguished at 5:30 p.m. When the fire was raging, Qiu Zhu's family, who lived at No. 82, was burned to death because they couldn't escape. A total of twelve houses, from No. 83 to No. 68, were affected. The biscuit factory at No. 83 and the Baofeng yarn factory were also included. When the fire trucks from the three sections of the fire brigade drove to the scene, they collided with the No. 4200 bus of the China Merchants Public Automobile Company at the intersection of Bao'an Road and Baoshan Road. Fortunately, the impact was not violent and there was no serious damage. However, according to the fire brigade's report, four firefighters, Kong Xianming, Shen Yunzhou, Wang Kaizhen, and Wang Kaibi, were injured in the chest, waist, hands, and feet. Qiu Zhu's family, who was burned to death, was from Yong. She was 45 years old and came to Shanghai a few days ago to visit her son-in-law, so she lived at No. 82.</p>
<p>Manufacturing Bureau Road: At 10:30 a.m. yesterday, a thatched shed in the second house near the Laojun Temple at No. 833 Lane, Manufacturing Bureau Road, Nanshi, was suddenly burned down. It is reported that the cause of the fire was because the place was very close to the railway. When the train passed by, a flame fell on the house, causing the fire. When the fire brigade drove to the scene, it had already spread to two houses (a total of three households). The second house was occupied by Yan Chengshun, who had given birth to a girl a month ago. Because the family was busy fighting the fire, the girl was burned to death. The fire lasted for 15 minutes and was extinguished at 10:45 a.m. Gao Changmiao, a patrol officer from the Second District General Office of the Public Security Bureau, personally supervised eight policemen to rush to suppress the fire and immediately brought Li Zhangshi (50 years old, Shandong native), the woman who started the fire, to the office for questioning. Then, he ordered the landlord to report to the court for inspection.</p>
<h3>Mao Youfu's Rampant Lawlessness: Assaults His Mother, Violates His Daughter</h3>
<p>Xie Jiao's mother and daughter were illegally detained by Mao.</p>
<p>They were tied up and severely beaten before managing to escape.</p>
<p>Show Ying's medical examination confirmed the violation.</p>
<p>Mao claims his wife was abducted and sold by the mother.</p>
<p>A woman from Yangzhou named Xie Jiao, along with her daughter Xiu Ying, resided in Yulin Lane, Pingliang Road. Xiu Ying, only fifteen years old, used to work at the Gonda Cotton Mill in Yangshupu. On the 28th of last month, at 6:00 PM after finishing work, she disappeared on her way home. Subsequently, a Mrs. Bai, who lived in the same house, informed Xie that Xiu Ying had been deceived and taken away by Mao Youfu, a resident of No. 88 Weixin Lane, from Zhenjiang. Mao's wife also worked at the Gonda Mill, which is how Mao knew Xiu Ying. After Xiu Ying arrived at Mao's home, Mao said to her, "Your mother has abducted and sold my wife. You must know the details. Tell me quickly." Xiu Ying didn't know what to say. Mao immediately grabbed a rope, tied her up, and beat her, hiding her in the front building. When Xie Jiao arrived at Mao's house, her daughter had just finished being beaten. Xie rebuked Mao for unreasonably bullying a young girl, but Mao retorted, accusing Xie of abducting and selling his wife. He then gathered several people, also bound Xie's hands, and dragged her into the kitchen, where they severely beat her with firewood. Afterward, he assigned an old woman to watch over her. Mao then moved Xiu Ying to the attic and forcibly raped her. Afterwards, he kept her confined in the front building, ordering his sister, Cai Mao, to watch over her. He originally intended to take her to the French Concession to hide, but the landlady of the second room, fearing future repercussions, strongly opposed it, so he did not proceed. Xie Jiao, trapped in the kitchen, could not cross the threshold nor call for help, so she had to spend the night there. The next morning, seeing the old woman watching over her still sound asleep, she immediately untied herself and escaped the trap. Waiting until the day before yesterday, she still hadn't seen her daughter return, and was forced to report to the Huishan Police Station, which dispatched Detective Cai Zhitian to Mao's house. They arrested Mao and his sister, Cai Mao, rescued Xiu Ying, and brought them back to the police station. Aside from detaining the siblings separately, they sent the girl to Guangren Hospital. After examination by a doctor, it was confirmed that she had indeed been raped. The doctor filled out a report and gave it to the police station. Yesterday morning, they summoned the victims, mother and daughter, and escorted Mao Youfu and Cai Mao to the Special District Local Court for trial. However, the old woman who was watching over Xie Jiao had already fled to an unknown location. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, presented the case and submitted the doctor's examination report. Xie Jiao and her daughter Xiu Ying then recounted the details of being lured, beaten, and raped. When questioned, Mao Youfu confessed, "Because my wife was abducted and sold, I had the caterer's wife trick Xiu Ying into coming to my house. She claimed that my wife was abducted and sold to Pudong by her mother, and her mother also admitted it. Therefore, I confined them in my house, but they escaped and went to the police station to file a complaint, which was rejected. So I brought them back to my house. Later, the police station sent detectives to investigate, but I did not rape Xiu Ying," and so on. Cai Mao also confessed, "It was true that my sister-in-law was introduced and sold to a Mr. Yao in Laobaidu by Xie Jiao. I know nothing else about the matter." According to Cai Chen, Mao's landlady of the second room, Xiu Ying was brought by the caterer's wife. Mao slapped her cheek, but she didn't know whether he raped her or not. Judge Feng ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3>Three Leaders of the Notorious Bandit Tai Bao A Shu's Gang Arrested</h3>
<p>Detectives confirmed their identities without error.</p>
<p>The three claimed to be rural farmers.</p>
<p>The notorious bandit Tai Bao A Shu and his gang have been harassing the townships and villages around the Su-Song area, committing rape, looting, and causing the people to suffer immensely. For several months, despite the dispatch of troops from Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces to encircle and suppress them, the bandits' whereabouts remained elusive and uncertain. The troops would arrive and the bandits would flee, the troops would leave and the bandits would return, so that the banditry has not yet been eradicated. On the 27th of last month, a certain village in Jiaxing was again subjected to a major robbery. The Jiahe Bandit Suppression Commander dispatched troops to strike a heavy blow. The bandits were overwhelmed and scattered again. Pan Guifu, the self-proclaimed Deputy Commander of Tai Bao A Shu, led his band to flee to Qingpu. However, with the government troops pursuing them closely, and finding no refuge in the interior, he and key members Tang Songlin and Lu Yingen fled to the Shanghai International Settlement, awaiting an opportunity to act again. The Jiahe Bandit Suppression Command also anticipated that these men would flee to Shanghai after their defeat, so they dispatched Detective Chief Li Nianyuan and Detective Chen Xinde, along with informant Gu Agui, to Shanghai to investigate and arrest them. When the bandits rallied the masses to rob and kill at Baziqiao in Jinshan, Gu Agui personally experienced the robbery. Therefore, he recognized most of the key figures among the bandits, from Tai Bao A Shu downwards. The day before yesterday, he unexpectedly encountered the three bandits Pan, Tang, and Lu in front of the "Flower World" (entertainment area) on Nanjing Road. The location was only a stone's throw away from the Laozha Police Station. He immediately reported to the police, who dispatched Detective Song Bingzheng and Detective Cui Jinchuan to arrest Pan and the others. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Zhou presided over the interrogation. Detective Li brought informant Gu Agui to the court, who testified that Pan and the other two were indeed leaders of Tai Bao A Shu's bandit gang. When questioned, the three men denied everything, claiming to be rural farmers. In reality, these people gather to become bandits and disperse to become farmers. Unless someone recognizes them, it is impossible to discern their true identities. Judge Zhou stated that he could not immediately hand them over because the Jiahe Bandit Suppression Command had not sent an official document to the court. He ordered Pan and the other two men to be detained and adjourned the hearing for two weeks. Detective Li has now gone to Jiaxing to request the official document.</p>
<h3>U.S. Consular Court Hears Garcia Case Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that the U.S. Consular Court held a hearing today (the 3rd) on the circumstances of the murder of Garcia, an American who had previously worked as a pilot at the New World entertainment complex, after he was killed at the intersection of Bazijiao Road and North Sichuan Road on Sunday morning (the 28th). The original coroner, Dr. Krillies, presided over the hearing. The first witness, a Mr. Fu who sold newspapers on Bazijiao Road, testified that he initially saw seven or eight foreigners standing at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Bazijiao Road. A few minutes later, two rickshaws carrying two Westerners turned from North Sichuan Road onto Bazijiao Road, heading east. As the rickshaws turned, the foreigners standing at the intersection of North Sichuan Road began to hurl abuse at the Westerners in the rickshaws. These people were all Filipinos. Before long, the rickshaws stopped, and the two Westerners got out of the rickshaws. A scuffle ensued, and the foreigners scattered and fled. One person was bleeding heavily and was helped onto a rickshaw by his companion. He then fell from the rickshaw. The next witness, Western Detective Mei Sheng, testified that he was passing by Bazijiao Road at 4:15 that morning when he caught sight of Garcia and his companion, Frank. Frank seemed to be drunk, while Garcia had been stabbed and was bleeding profusely. He summoned two day constables to take them to Country Hospital, and he reported to the Hongkou Police Station. By the time he arrived at the scene, the Filipinos had already disappeared. Then, Dr. Pinnard from Country Hospital testified that Garcia died shortly after arriving at the hospital. An examination of his left chest revealed a knife wound, which was likely the cause of death due to excessive blood loss. Next, Western Detective Stock of the Hongkou Police Station testified that he arrested Filipino Spears at 8:30 on Sunday evening. Spears immediately confessed to the crime without denial. Finally, after testimony from Mrs. Taut, Garcia's employer, the hearing was adjourned to be continued tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Ordnance Factory Commemorates Workers Killed in the June 3rd Incident</h3>
<p>Date set for the 12th of this month. Shanghai Ordnance Factory will hold a memorial service at 9:00 AM on the 12th of this month at the Labor Union Auditorium of the Ordnance Factory on Zhizaoju Road to commemorate the more than 20 workers who were killed in the tragic explosion at the June 3rd Pharmaceutical Factory. All factory workers will attend the memorial service, and the factory will also send Section Chief Zhang Wenshu to attend.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle Between Police and Bandits Outside Wusong Estuary</h3>
<p>At around 9:00 PM the night before last, three large sailing junks suddenly appeared on the waters of Xingang Town outside the Wusong Estuary, carrying more than 50 pirates. They first robbed the merchant ships anchored in the harbor, then armed themselves and landed ashore, storming the town's Public Security Bureau and stealing more than ten rifles. As they were about to sail away, the nearby water police and guards arrived upon hearing the news and engaged them. The bandits returned fire, and a fierce battle ensued for more than half an hour. The bandits were overwhelmed and four were captured on the spot. Two Mauser pistols and two rifles were seized. The rest escaped and their ships sailed away. The captured bandits were sent to the Nantong County government for legal proceedings. Meanwhile, the 18th squadron of the Wusong water police is conducting a strict search in the nearby waters.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Prohibition of Gangsters Intruding into Bookbinding Workshops</h3>
<p>Teasing female workers and extorting male workers.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a report to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday stating, "The bookbinding trade association claims that gangsters intrude into bookbinding workshops to tease female workers, and requests a strict prohibition. We are forwarding the situation for your review." The report stated that on October 2nd, the Shanghai Bookbinding Trade Association submitted a report stating, "We have instructed our members to open workshops, but gangsters frequently intrude, arbitrarily teasing the female workers.</p>
<p>They even lie on the worktables, making strange noises and acting wildly, which is unspeakable. As for the male workers, they make unfounded demands, and if their demands are not met, they start fights. The workshop owners hear about the gangsters but are afraid to intervene. This situation is particularly prevalent in the Zhabei district. If a strict prohibition is not issued, it will affect both public morals and business operations. Therefore, we request your association to forward this request to the Social Affairs and Public Safety Bureaus to jointly issue a public notice that, in the future, no one shall be allowed to enter the workshops without a legitimate reason or the permission of the workshop owner, to prevent disruption of work and unexpected events. Otherwise, the workshop owner shall be allowed to hand them over to the nearest Public Safety Bureau for punishment, in order to protect work and secure commerce." Upon investigation, it is a common practice for workshops in this city to employ female workers, and this is not unique to bookbinding workshops. Now it is reported that gangsters frequently intrude into the bookbinding workshops established by the members of the association, teasing female workers and making strange noises. They arbitrarily extort male workers, and if their demands are not met, they start fights. If such evil practices are not strictly prohibited, the impact will be immeasurable. We believe that it is reasonable to report the situation to your bureau for review and request that you send a letter to the Public Safety Bureau to jointly issue a public notice to strictly investigate and prohibit such actions, in order to maintain order in the workshops. This would be in the public interest.</p>

<h3>Municipal Public Utilities Bureau Takes Over Streetlights in Fahua and Jiangwan</h3>
<p>The streetlights in the Fahua and Jiangwan districts of this city have previously been managed by the respective district municipal committees. In order to unify authority and rectify the situation, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau submitted a report to the Municipal Government, which was approved, and dispatched personnel to take over the streetlights separately on October 1st. This includes 24 kerosene streetlights in Fahua Town, 41 electric streetlights around Xujiahui, and 81 electric streetlights in Jiangwan Town. It is reported that the bureau will begin to reorganize the streetlights after the takeover, first replacing the older and less luminous electric lights with new ones, and then gradually adding new lights as needed. As soon as Fahua Town is connected to electricity, all the kerosene streetlights will be replaced with electric lights. Furthermore, since Jiangwan Town is far from the bureau's existing North Shanghai Streetlight Management Office, which makes management difficult, a Jiangwan Streetlight Management Office has been established in the town, which began operations on October 2nd. All streetlights within the district that were originally under the jurisdiction of the North Shanghai Management Office will be transferred to the Jiangwan Management Office for convenience.</p>
<h3>Two Academic Societies Welcome Delegates to the World Power Conference</h3>
<p>In May of this year, the World Power Conference held its second meeting in Berlin, Germany. The Chinese attendees included Mr. Huang Boqiao, representing the Chinese Institute of Engineers and the municipal governments of Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hankou; Mr. Li Yanshi and Mr. Shen Sifang, representing the Chinese Electrical Engineering Society; and Mr. Wang Shengsan, representing the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways. All have returned to Shanghai one after another. The German, Austrian, and Swiss Alumni Association of the Chinese Institute of Engineers and the Chinese Electrical Engineering Society jointly held a welcome meeting at the Duyichu Sichuan Restaurant on Avenue Edward VII at 7:00 PM on October 1st. More than 70 members of the two societies attended and celebrated together, which greatly increased their interest. At the end of the meeting, Mr. Hu Shuhua delivered a welcome speech and invited Mr. Huang Boqiao and others to share their experiences and observations from their travels, so as to broaden their horizons. Mr. Huang then began to describe how European countries mostly establish themselves through industry. Currently, the world's sales are stagnant, causing 6 out of 10 factories to shut down. The number of unemployed people is increasing day by day. If this cannot be remedied, it may trigger unrest and affect global security. Even with the diligence of the German people, they still cannot avoid a difficult life. The Chinese people's food and lodging are too extravagant, and they should be frugal in order to save money for useful purposes and engage in beneficial businesses. Mr. Li Yanshi first described the excellent management of German factories. Unfortunately, the burden of war reparations has affected them, and their capital is depleted. They can only rely on borrowing American debt to facilitate circulation. Therefore, even though they are facing economic difficulties, they still have to maintain a grand facade in order to maintain international credit. Fortunately, factories and the government can help each other and still manage to maintain themselves. He then said that China's industry and commerce are restricted by unequal treaties. Taxes on foreign goods are lighter than those on domestic goods. Domestically, they are affected by the war, and public debt and treasury bonds are forced to be subscribed, causing factory operations to not be revitalized and capital to be exploited. He deeply hopes that the engineering community can provide sympathy and assistance to the industrial community, and that the government will reduce the burden on domestic goods manufacturers, so that business development and industrial prosperity can be expected. Mr. Shen Sifang said that the progress of the electrical industry in Europe and the United States is progressing by leaps and bounds, while the electrical industry in China is still in its infancy. Therefore, the Chinese Electrical Engineering Society was recently organized. In the future, he hopes that the Chinese Institute of Engineers and the German, Austrian, and Swiss Alumni Association will provide guidance at any time and cooperate fully in order to develop the future of the domestic electrical industry. The guests and hosts all enjoyed themselves and dispersed.</p>
<h3>New Buick Cars Arrive in Shanghai</h3>

It is said that the new car has many features, such as adding up to eight cylinders and gears. The new car is now officially on display at the American Buick Automobile Company on Jing'an Temple Road. All sectors of society are welcome to visit.</p>
<h3>Clever Plan to Snatch Golden Buttons Fails</h3>
<p>A young woman releases her grip after the thief pulls down his pants.</p>
<p>The robber is eventually caught.</p>
<p>Wang Xu, a young woman residing at No. 1 Liyuan Lane, West Ma Bridge, was on her way to soak her feet the night before last when she encountered a bandit, Song Guoyou, who noticed the golden buttons on her clothes and had the idea of robbing them. He stepped forward and snatched at the golden buttons, but Wang grabbed him. In a moment of desperation, Song pulled down his pants and urinated to deter the woman. As a result, the woman released her grip out of shame, and Song tried to escape. Wang then shouted "Catch the robber!" and passersby helped to apprehend him. He was then handed over to the beat police from Precinct 2 Section 1 and escorted to the court for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Zhou Huchen Trademark Dispute: Wang Chunjian's Appeal Case to Be Announced</h3>
<p>Wang Chunjian from Yangzhou leased the trademark of the Zhou Huchen brush shop from the Zhou Huchen brush shop in Jiangxi in the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927). He opened a brush shop on Xiangfen Lane in Shanghai, using the Zhou Huchen name on the brush handles, but adding the words "Zheng Ji" (Authentic Mark). However, since Shanghai already had the Zhou Huchen brush shop of Jin Yun, Fu Jin Yun, the owner of the old Zhou Huchen shop, filed a lawsuit in the Special District Court against Wang, claiming trademark infringement. Wang Chunjian voluntarily abandoned his rights and closed the shop, ending the dispute. Unexpectedly, Wang Chunhua, Wang Chunjian's younger brother, still had many unsold brushes with the Zhou Huchen name on them. Fu Jin Yun saw him in transit and took him to the police station. At the same time, Fu Jin Yun filed a complaint with the local court, sentencing Wang to two months in prison and a fine of one hundred yuan. Wang refused to accept the sentence and hired lawyer Jin Yu to file an appeal. The High Court ordered a retrial. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen opened a court hearing and summoned the police officer from Precinct 2, Section 1, He Shutang, as a key witness. After asking about his age and background, the judge asked how many words were engraved on the pen he found that day. The officer replied, "Only six words, 'Lao Hu Chen Yun Jin Zhi' (Old Tiger Chen Yun Jin Made)." The judge said, "That's strange. The pen name is engraved with 'Jiuchong Chunse Zui Xiantao' (Nine Layers of Spring Colors Intoxicate the Immortal Peach), and these seven words are larger than the six words below 'Lao Hu Chen Jin Yun Zhi' (Old Tiger Chen Jin Yun Made). The top seven words are colored blue, while the bottom six words are completely engraved but not colored. Instead, you clearly noticed the seven words 'Jiuchong Chunse Zui Xiantao', and only paid attention to the six words 'Lao Hu Chen Jin Yun Zhi'. And you also misspoke 'Yun Jin Zhi' (Cloud Brocade Made), it is 'Jin Yun Zhi' (Brocade Cloud Made). Were there any imitation calligraphy scrolls at that time?" The officer replied, "No." Then the appellant's lawyer, Jin, argued that the imitation calligraphy scrolls were wrapped outside the brushes. The police officer did not see them. How could he pay attention to the six words "Lao Hu Chen Jin Yun Zhi" which was not colored on the pen shaft, which is not logical. After much questioning and argument, the judge announced the end of the debate and ordered them to wait for the verdict on the 8th of this month and dismissed them.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Burns Opium Yesterday</h3>
<p>Jianghai Customs held a burning of prohibited drugs confiscated within the 208th period at the steam kiln in Lujiazui, Pudong, yesterday. At 8:00 AM, Liang Qingyun, a committee member of the Customs Supervisory Office, went to the customs and, together with Ge Yixin, a representative of the Tax Affairs Department, and Robert, a Western warehouse manager, supervised Chinese and Western customs officers to escort the various drugs across the river to Pudong. Supervisors from various agencies arrived, including Liang Guang from the Garrison Headquarters, Yu Ding from the Shanghai Special District Court, Wang Zhizhong from the Local Court, Zhu Weiyao from the Municipal Government, Zhang Xingbang from the County Government, and Shen Chuan from the Anti-Drug Association. Zhang Mingqin, the district chief of the 3rd District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, led a platoon of armed police to the scene to maintain order. The burning began at 9:00 AM and ended at 11:00 AM. A total of 9 dan 21 jin 11 liang and 7.5 qian of opium were burned (estimated value of 95,004 silver dollars), as well as 17 iron barrels of morphine, weighing 4,072 liang (estimated value of more than 40,500 silver dollars), and 26 dan of poppy husks (estimated value of 390 silver dollars). In addition, there were 23 jin and 4 liang of pills containing morphine and 26 jin of anti-smoking pills (estimated total value of 1,014 silver dollars). The Post Office also sent 27 and a half jin of anti-smoking pills seized from mailed packages (above estimated total value of 1,014 silver dollars). The drugs mentioned above, except for those sent by the Post Office, were seized by customs officers on various ships from June 21st to September 20th of this year.</p>
<h3>"Flower Association Listening Tube King" Arrested</h3>
<p>The French Concession police authorities, in view of the increasing prevalence of Flower Association gambling within the concession, which is seriously detrimental to society, received a confidential report the day before yesterday stating that Shi Bingrong, who is known as the "Flower Association Listening Tube King," is currently using the Yongxingxiang tobacco and paper shop near Fangbang Bridge within the concession as a front. In reality, he dispatches his followers to set up listening tubes in various places to lure people to gamble. Please instruct the detectives to arrest him as soon as possible.

<h3>Chongming Ship Capsizes in a Storm</h3>
<p>All seven sailors and passengers fell into the water.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they were rescued by two Japanese ships.</p>
<p>The Chongming ship Jin Changshun set sail for Shanghai yesterday morning, loaded with horse manure. At 11:00 AM, when it arrived at the Kangtai sunken ship area of Sanjia Water outside the Wusong Estuary, it was suddenly hit by a violent storm, causing the entire ship to capsize immediately. The bottom of the ship faced the sky, and the three sailors and four passengers inside all fell into the water. Fortunately, Kiki Shoichiro, the head of the Tokyo Steamship Company residing on the Pudong shore who was salvaging the sunken ship Kangtai, saw it and immediately ordered the Jiangtai and Tongyi small ships to rush to the rescue. When the two ships arrived at the scene, they saw the drowning people clinging to the sinking ship. They rescued the seven people one by one and sailed back to the company's thatched shed. They ordered the people to disembark and change their wet clothes. Among them were Mrs. Huang, the 20-year-old wife of passenger Yin Dalang, and her 3-year-old son Zu Kang. Because they had been in the water for more than one minute, their faces were pale and they were unconscious. The Japanese personnel used hot soup to try to rescue them, and they gradually regained consciousness. Later, it was learned that Yin Dalang had brought his wife and children to Shanghai to seek employment, but all the clothes, bedding, money, etc. they had with them had been washed away. The public raised several dollars for Yin to use as travel expenses. The other crew members, Jin Zhangfu, Yu Hongbao, Gu Wanxing, and the other three, saw the sunken ship suddenly turned over by the tide, with the deck facing upwards. However, all the items inside the ship had sunk. The crew then took charge of the ship's hull and planned to return to Chongming for repairs.</p>
<h3>A Sudden Assassin in the Birthday Hall</h3>
<p>Li Deyuan Hosts a Feast for His Mother's Birthday</p>
<p>A Bloody Incident at the Huibinlou Restaurant</p>
<p>Li Deyuan, a 43-year-old Tianjin native currently residing on the upper floor of a rice shop in Rue Richelieu, French Concession, previously served as a patrol officer in the Second Precinct of the Fourth District of Zhabei. He has since resigned and started a business. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Li hosted a banquet for relatives and friends at the Huibinlou Restaurant on Third Avenue to celebrate his mother's 70th birthday. Unexpectedly, while Li was entertaining the guests, six men in short jackets appeared, claiming to be delivering gifts. One of them handed Li two silver dollars. As Li accepted the gift, unsure of who sent it, he inquired about the sender. Suddenly, one of the men stabbed Li in the buttocks with a knife, penetrating an inch deep. After withdrawing the knife, he attempted to stab Li in the throat. Fortunately, Li's friend, Wang Desan, noticed this and immediately stepped forward to block the attack. Wang's hand was also cut in the process, but Li was spared from further injury. Seeing that Li was stabbed, the six men, having achieved their goal, fled the scene. Li collapsed to the ground, bleeding profusely. Li's relatives and friends immediately gave chase, and two of the assassins were apprehended by patrol officers. Two daggers were confiscated and all were taken to the Xinzha Police Station, awaiting transfer to the Special District Court for questioning. The injured Li Deyuan was taken to the Beishi Hospital for treatment. It is said that Li's injuries are severe and his condition is critical. According to Li's wife, Chen Qiaoyun, the attack may have been carried out by enemies from her husband's time as a patrol officer in the Second Precinct of the Fourth District of Zhabei. Regardless, it was a tragic event.</p>

<h3>Conspiracy to Rob a Bank Escort Foiled</h3>

<p>Detective Team Arrested Suspects and Took Statements</p>
<p>Around 8:00 AM yesterday, four men, named A, B, C, and D, were seen near the Xinmatou Limmalu in Nanshi. One of them was wearing a military uniform, appearing as armed comrades. They lingered near the railway tracks, whispering to each other and looking around, seemingly engaged in a secret operation. Detective Xu Yulin of the First District, who happened to be passing by, found their behavior suspicious. He immediately reported it to the detective team leader, Dong Mingde, who, along with detectives Yuan Haishan, Yu Maolong, Lü Anpu, and Ren Shouzhi, rushed to the scene. The man in military uniform and another man were already gone, leaving only two men still loitering. They were immediately apprehended and taken in for questioning. One of them identified himself as Li A'da, a 30-year-old native of Chongming, residing in Lane 4 of Tianxiang Lane, Rue Paillet, French Concession. He confessed that his acquaintance, Lu A'xiao, a 27-year-old who worked as a chauffeur for He Dingfu, a runner for the Yi Shen Qian Zhuang at 88 Huayi Street, had told him that Yi Shen Qian Zhuang had been in business for many years and was very successful. Every morning between 8:00 and 9:00 AM, the bank would send employees to a certain bank with cash, usually around three to four thousand dollars, and that Xinmatou was a necessary passage for the escort. Lu said that if they were interested, they could wait there and easily obtain a large sum of money. Li admitted that he was tempted by this information and, along with his fellow villager Huang A'ming and the fugitive Li A'si, as well as Wu Yugen, who wore the military uniform, had conspired in a nearby teahouse to carry out the robbery today (yesterday). However, just as Li A'si had gone ahead with a handgun to commit the robbery, they were apprehended. Li also confessed that Li A'si was staying at a certain hotel. The other man identified himself as Huang A'ming, 36 years old, also admitting to the failed robbery. The detectives then went to the address and apprehended Wu Yugen, but Li A'si had already fled upon hearing the news. They also went to the Yi Shen Qian Zhuang and apprehended Lu A'xiao, who confessed to initiating the robbery plot. Wu confessed that he was 26 years old, a native of Taizhou, and a recruiting officer in the Training Regiment, also admitting to plotting to rob Yi Shen Qian Zhuang's money. As the case involved robbery, they were immediately transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Sea Guest</p>
<p>Old Gentleman (sitting in a chair, pointing to his knee, to a child): Little friend, come over here. Would you like to ride on my knee?</p>
<p>Child: I don't want to. A fake mule is no fun. I'd rather pay money to ride a real mule.</p>
<p>Woman A: That scoundrel dared to insult me.</p>
<p>Woman B: How did he insult you?</p>
<p>Woman A: He talked to me at length about things during the Guangxu era, asking if I remembered them. Isn't that clearly insulting me, treating me like an old woman?</p>

<h3>Record of Trivia at the North Station</h3>
<p>— Lanxi</p>
<p>After a long period of preparation, the employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have all received a badge. The badge is over two inches long and six or seven minutes wide. In the middle, there is a horizontal railway track, with a wheel with wings running on it. Of course, we know what this symbolizes. In the blank space above the badge, the words "Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration" are written. The back of the badge is marked with a number, which has been properly assigned in advance. So-and-so's number is such-and-such. One gentleman received the number "606," and another received "914." Both looked worried and unhappy, but there was nothing they could do. "It's all predetermined," someone joked. "We have both internal and external medicines prepared here."</p>
<p>The autumn wind has swept across everything on the earth. We are now implementing an eight-hour work system, from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Director Liu is very serious about this. He inspects the offices early in the morning, limiting the hours that people come to the station. Every month, a new book is used for signing in. Everyone in our department is rushing to sign in the first two or three names. When it comes to the 13th, they all suffer from "Western superstition" and are a little embarrassed. No one wants to sign. They even say, "Mr. He Yingqin wouldn't sign on the 13th either." But no matter what, there is always a brave person who signs.</p>
<p>Train attendant Chen Yuting found 410 Japanese yen on the train, which was left behind by a Japanese lieutenant general. The attendant returned the money to his superiors without keeping any of it. Let's leave that aside for now. After discovering that his money was missing, the lieutenant general reported it to the Railway Department. The Railway Department found that the items lost by the lieutenant general matched those found by Chen Yuting and returned the money to the lieutenant general. The lieutenant general was grateful and thanked the Chinese for their old morality that had not been lost. He sent a letter to the Railway Department with 50 yuan, asking them to pass it on to Yuting to commend his righteousness and encourage others. The Railway Department refused, believing that this was the attendant's duty, and a major merit was sufficient. However, the lieutenant general sent the letter back, insisting that it was necessary. And so it was done, and Chen Yuting's reputation became very impressive.</p>
<h3>Autumn Sounds on the Sea</h3>
<p>— Xing Qiu</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu, a master of the Qingyi (lead female role) and Huashan (one who plays vivacious, coquettish women) styles, is unparalleled in his art, having established his own school. He is chivalrous, righteous, and respected as a virtuous man by the nation. This time, he is engaged by the Rong Ji Grand Theater, arriving in Shanghai for the ninth time to perform his best plays, fulfilling the expectations of Shanghai's audiences.</p>
<p>Yanqiu plays Zhang Yuzhen in "The Jade Bracelet." Amidst the splendor, he embodies the four virtues of "seclusion, gracefulness, chastity, and tranquility." The various imaginings in the wedding night scene are like unraveling silk from a cocoon, with layers of emotions unfolding. His expressions of surprise, shyness, resentment, and affection change in an instant. His forbearance before his aunt, his concealment before his mother, his veiled anger before his husband, and his dignified demeanor before his maidservant are all perfectly rendered. He is truly a master of emotional expression. His singing is equally impressive: the Xipi tune before dressing up, the Nan Bangzi in the wedding chamber, the Erliu when bidding farewell to his mother, and the Erhuang in the sickroom are all refined through countless practice sessions, exquisitely showcasing the nuances of lingering emotions, entanglements, pauses, and sobs. The softness and trills of his voice, and the novelty of his melodies, are simply breathtaking.</p>
<p>"The Fa Men Temple" is an extremely old, difficult, and valuable Qingyi Zheng Gong (pure and proper lead female role) play. Yanqiu has a natural gift for singing, so understanding the melodies is easy. He also comprehends the essence of the performance. Therefore, performing this play, he turns difficulties into ease, achieving perfection effortlessly. Further complemented by Wang Shaolou as Zhao Lian and Jin Shaoshan as Liu Jin, their performances are even better as the trial progresses. Jiang Miaoxiang, Furong Cao, Wu Fuqin, and Wen Liangchen each excel in their respective roles.</p>
<p>Yanqiu, standing tall and graceful, is particularly elegant in Qing dynasty attire. His performance of the "Visiting Mother" and "Returning the Order" scene, from singing to acting to recitation, is flawlessly brilliant. The questions and answers in the scene are especially fitting, and the detailed performance is unprecedented. The subtlety in the oath, the gracefulness in the curtsy, and the agility in stealing the order are all exquisitely portrayed. Zhundai's demeanor of shock and helplessness while returning the order is like mercury spilling onto the ground, penetrating every crevice. The way he gives his greetings are graceful, unhurried, and unafraid. The singing in Yaoban, Daoban, Kuaiban, and Manban are all clear in pronunciation, novel in melody, and exquisite in tune.</p>
<p>In Yanqiu's "Fen He Bay," the singing is clear in pronunciation and exquisite in every tune. The acting is vivid and lifelike. In the scene where she instructs Ding Shan, the dialogue is subtle and the movements are composed, perfectly capturing the loving heart of a mother. In the "Trouble at the Kiln" scene, the vanity of a woman and her fit of pique are portrayed with exceptional realism. Yanqiu, feeling that it was not beautiful enough, expanded the story into a full-length "Liu Yingchun," starting from Liu Yuewai building a house and Xue Rengui begging for money, all the way to "Fen He Bay," for a total of twenty-four scenes. There are literary and martial elements, singing and acting, reunions and separations, joys and sorrows, riches and poverty, encompassing the grand panorama of human affairs. It is a masterpiece that is appreciated by both the refined and the common.</p>

<p>In the border regions of Yunnan, there is a custom of "cursing grass," using human effort to create a magical entity. This is done during a young woman's maidenhood. In the years before marriage, to ensure future control over her husband, she selects a grass outside the wall in the garden and curses it. The method is as follows: every morning, she walks alone to the grass, first breathing on it three times. Then, she whispers to it, "I love you... Can you listen to me?... Can you do as I wish?" This is done every morning, becoming a daily ritual, rain or shine, for three years. The grass will then remain green throughout the year and become spiritually connected to her. When the woman smiles at it, the grass will stretch its branches and leaves, showing joy. If she shouts at it sternly, it will shrink its leaves and lower its head, showing fear. At this point, the woman happily tells her mother that the cursing of the grass is successful. The mother then accompanies her daughter to the grass to test it. If it works as expected, she is also surprised and delighted. She then plucks the grass and brings it home to make into a medicine, which she keeps secret as a gift for her daughter's wedding. This custom has been practiced for a long time, passed down from mother to daughter. The woman brings this medicine to her husband's home and secretly places it in his food for the groom to eat. Her husband will then, without realizing it, develop a mixture of love and fear toward his wife, paying close attention to her expressions and serving her with care. He will share her sorrows and joys. He will become so docile that he will obey her every command, kneeling when told and rising when permitted. Even if she whips him, he will bear it without complaint. Even the most brutal of ancient punishments would not be as harsh as this. The limits of incense and water are not as strict as this. This was recounted by a friend who was a government official in Yunnan. Men grow protective grass to forget their sorrows, find joy in seeing mimosa trees, nurture brotherly love with the purple Bauhinia, and stir thoughts of longing with red bean branches. Plants that are spiritually connected often respond to human emotions, but none are as strange and bizarre as this. Perhaps, among uncivilized barbarians, unusual customs develop. Through the binding of sincerity, even metal and stone can be opened. Or perhaps, reason dictates that this should be so.</p>
<h3>An Amusing Anecdote Amidst Bandit Suppression</h3>
<p>— Gong Yu</p>
<p>A guest spoke of an amusing incident during the suppression of bandits in Lindong Township. Due to years of flooding in Linhai, the local area was extremely desolate. Those with some assets could barely survive, but the extremely poor mostly became bandits, leading to a surge in banditry that was extremely harmful. Government troops were sent to suppress them, but the bandits would simply flee elsewhere, making it difficult to eradicate them completely. In addition to ordering the people of each village to defend themselves, the county government also set rewards, encouraging people to capture bandits: a certain amount for capturing them alive, and a certain amount for killing them. As a result, the people were extremely active. Whenever bandits attacked or government troops advanced, they would bravely assist. Soldiers who captured or killed bandits were also rewarded according to the regulations. Previously, Yang Chuanxi's gang of bandits had sent letters to the villages of Tantou and Chishui, demanding 1,000 yuan. The villages ignored them and secretly reported to the garrison in Dongcheng Town. A platoon of provincial security guards was stationed there, led by Platoon Leader Hou. After learning that Yang and his gang would attack on a certain morning, Hou led his twenty-odd men and ambushed them on the side of the road. When Yang's gang arrived, they suddenly attacked, leading to a fierce battle. At first, Hou's forces were at a disadvantage due to being outnumbered. But then, the villagers of both villages beat gongs and gathered to assist the government troops, and the nearby anti-smuggling patrol also rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, quickly gaining the upper hand. Yang's gang could not resist and retreated. One of the soldiers from the anti-smuggling patrol saw a bandit fall to the ground after being shot. Thinking he had killed the bandit, he ran to the bandit to cut off his head and claim the reward from the county government. Unexpectedly, this bandit, though fallen, was not dead and still had a handgun. When the soldier approached, the bandit fired a shot, hitting the soldier's wrist. The soldier was in extreme pain and nearly fell. At the same time, another soldier ran over. The bandit fired again, but missed, and had used all of his bullets. The soldier, however, had a gun and bullets, and shot the bandit dead. The soldier with the injured wrist endured the pain and cut off the bandit's head. Enraged that the bandit had injured his wrist, he dug out the bandit's eyes, ears, nose, and mouth with his bayonet, leaving the head a bloody mess, barely recognizable as human. After the remaining bandits dispersed, the soldier carried the head to Hou, asking him to report it to the county government so he could receive the fifteen-yuan reward as per the regulations. Hou, seeing that the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth had all been dug out, felt that it was too cruel and was displeased. He simply handed the soldier a few cigarettes, saying, "Go, go. This is a small reward for your service in killing the bandit. But in the future, be careful not to do this again. There is no such method of punishing bandits in the world." Thus, because of his momentary anger, the soldier lost both the fifteen-yuan reward and the right to it, along with the bandit's eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. He only received a few cigarettes, and couldn't help but lament his misfortune.</p>
<h3>The Life of Mr. Zhao Tieqiao (1)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Guangzu</p>
<p>On July 24th of the 19th year of the Republic [1930], bandits assassinated my late father next to the side gate of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's General Administration in Shanghai. Guangzu received the telegram and rushed to mourn him. I had only been in Paris for a few days, having left the country only fifty days earlier. I still remember when I left, my late father told me, "My son, you are now grown up and should be sensible. It is not easy to study in Europe. Our family has no accumulated wealth. Everything I earn through hard work while I am still healthy will be given to you. If that is not enough, I will borrow to help you. But I am a party member, and this body is not mine. If I am unfortunate, I entrust your mother and younger siblings to you." Guangzu understood the pain in his words, thinking that academic success would bring him comfort. Who knew that only fifty days after leaving the country, I would become a fatherless person, and my mother and siblings would weep blood thinking of these words.</p>
<p>My late father had been in charge of the bureau for over two years, arriving at the bureau every day at 9 AM. He would normally enter through the Bund's main gate. That day, at 8:30 AM, my mother and late father were riding together, passing the side gate on Fuzhou Road. An attendant helped my late father alight. He entered the gate, climbed a few stone steps, and before he could reach the top, a gunshot rang out. The attendant fell to the ground to avoid the bullet. Another shot rang out, and my late father was wounded and ran quickly upstairs, sitting in the secretary's office. His inner and outer garments were completely red. The assassin fled through the gate. My mother saw it from the car and called for the police. The driver also honked the horn, but no one responded. In a hurry, my late father drove himself to Baolong Hospital. Before arriving, he changed to the Red Cross Hospital. The hospital doctor performed surgery, removing several bowls of contaminated blood. Upon examination, one bullet had entered from the back, damaging the liver, and exited through the right abdomen. Blood flowed out uncontrollably. In the afternoon, the pain intensified. He died at 9 PM. Attempts to capture the assassin were unsuccessful. However, acquaintances and strangers alike said that my late father had died for the sake of the bureau's affairs.</p>
<p>In October of the 16th year [1927], my late father took office as the Director-General of the Supervisory Office of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. In February of the 17th year [1928], the bureau was reorganized, and he also served as the Director-General of the General Administration. In June of the 18th year [1929], the National Government specially appointed a commissioner to be responsible for the restructuring of the bureau, with the Director-General acting on behalf of the commissioner. The bureau had been established for over fifty years. The inadequacies in regulations, the poor organization, the unclear system, the source of embezzled funds, and the nests of corruption and laziness were rampant. Once someone entered its ranks, their siblings, wives, and concubines, as well as their impoverished acquaintances and even the impoverished acquaintances of their siblings, wives, and concubines, would all depend on it for food and clothing or seek great profits. After the fall of the Qing dynasty, the problems became even worse. From Yuan Shikai, Xu Shichang, Cao Kun, and others, high officials were successively appointed to take over, but those appointed were afraid of trouble and greedy for profit. They brought gold with them but left without ever taking office. After the National Government organized a committee to investigate and restructure it, the task of reform was entrusted to my late father. Some advised my late father not to enter the bureau in the name of the government, and that hundreds of thousands of yuan could be obtained quickly. My late father was unmoved. Then they plotted to intercept and coerce him, but he still refused to yield. Then they plotted to slander him. My late father entered the bureau, proclaimed the government's intentions, changed the accounting system and the organization of the bureau, reorganized the business, created detailed statistics, established regulations, set budgets, saved on materials, managed the wharves, and cleared the bureau's assets. There was nothing, no matter how big or small, difficult or easy, that he did not handle, to promote benefits and eliminate harm. There was no private collusion above or below, and no suspicion inside or outside. Ten months after the reorganization, business revenue increased dramatically, silencing and silencing those who plotted to slander him. He had drafted a fundamental reform plan for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, advocating for "commercial enterprises to be state-run." Before the proposal could be finalized, the country was beset by many troubles. Most of the bureau's coastal ships were requisitioned for military use. The business had recovered but declined again. My late father died with grievances unaddressed.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (287)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Tears on the Bamboo, a Broken-hearted Beauty; The Scent of the Lotus Fades, a Young Woman's Soul Departs</p>
<p>Cuiyun thinks about her current situation, which is even more distressing and less free than being a courtesan in a brothel. In a brothel, there are still people who pity her, people who might rescue her, and she can still think of ways to redeem herself. Now, she has no relatives or friends to turn to. Her body is forever sold to them, with no chance of turning her life around. Is this how her life will end? Living such a life is worse than death. She feels like a critically ill patient in a hospital with no hope of recovery, waiting only to die. Even if she dies, no one will know. She will simply be moved out. Feeling that there is no hope for the future, she can't muster any enthusiasm for anything. Young women naturally love to dress up, but she has no interest in dressing up anymore. As her body completely weakens, she resolutely loses the desire to even roll cigarettes. She claims she is sick and cannot get out of bed. The Ningbo old man has to ask others to roll cigarettes for her. He mutters to himself, "Even pigs that are slaughtered aren't eaten with their hair on. If you don't roll cigarettes, am I supposed to die from withdrawal?" But pretending to be sick can lead to real illness. At first, Cuiyun was simply unhappy and lacked energy, so she stubbornly stayed in bed, unwilling to roll cigarettes for him. Later, she suddenly started coughing, thinking she might have caught a cold. She didn't pay much attention. But then, she started coughing up phlegm with some blood in it, and there was a bloody taste in her throat. She quickly looked into the spittoon and felt her heart pounding and her body half-numb. She thought to herself, "It's over. This is the end." As she carefully examined the spittoon, a little maid in the house rushed to tell the Ningbo old man that the concubine was spitting blood. The Ningbo old man said, "Why are you making such a fuss? You don't even know if it's blood from her teeth or her lips. Blood always puts on such airs!" Cuiyun initially tried to comfort herself, thinking that it might not be blood from her lungs and that her heart was pounding because she was frightened. But after a moment, the fine, annoying strands of blood were still mixed in, and she felt an itch in her throat, making her want to cough. After coughing, she wanted to spit, and her phlegm always had strands of red in it. At that time, Zhang Yiqing had gone to Hankou again. Cuiyun took a long breath and couldn't help but shed tears. She thought, "At first, I thought I was like a hopeless patient in a hospital. But I wasn't actually sick then. Now I really am sick!" That night, her pillow was soaked with tears. A few days later, Zhang Yiqing returned. She told him about it, and he was a bit startled. But when he looked at Cuiyun, with her yellow, emaciated face and large, sunken eyes, she looked completely like a patient. He felt that leaving the fun and exciting places to keep company with a patient diminished the enjoyment. Therefore, he couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment towards Cuiyun.</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Markets Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>Major Investors Focus on Selling</p>
<p>Internal Dissension in Foreign Exchange Market is Extreme</p>
<p>A Clear Sign of Weakness. Yesterday, the price of gold continued to reach new lows for three consecutive days. However, fluctuations were erratic, with shifts of three or four liang (taels) per transaction. The total range of ups and downs for both morning and afternoon sessions was eleven liang. But throughout the day there was an underlying weakness. The price was influenced by major investors’ inclination to sell. Furthermore, the loose trading in foreign exchange was extremely unusual. Exchange rates were already half a stop higher, with banks selling. Even interbank transactions were unusually frequent, with sellers outpacing buyers. Major firms such as Yu Da, Zhifeng Yong, Fufeng Yong, Yuanyuan Xing, Bing Fu Chang, and investment firms, such as the Indian trader Qiao Ribu, were heavy sellers, while buyers were Shunli, Wanxing, Hengxing, Yuanyuan Mao, Yongxing, etc. Although the price showed some signs of rising in the morning, it was not affected by the slightly increased demand. It once exceeded 570 taels. Subsequently, selling pressure intensified. Rumors also circulated that the silver market might rise, with suggestions of relief measures from British and Indian sides. However, the news eroded investor confidence, leading to a gradual decline, with a great risk of a collapse. It eventually plunged by more than ten taels. Later, various firms such as Qiu Gong, Ge Shu, Yuan Cheng, Yuanyuan Xing, Yong Heng Xing, etc. were involved in making the deposit, while Zhifeng, Yong Da, Decheng, etc. were primarily sellers. Market conditions were chaotic and volatile. Initially, the market was stable but later weakened, dropping to as low as 60 taels. It then hovered between 63 and 64 taels. The price of drafts (bills of exchange) was initially steady but later declined.</p>
<p>High Opening in Morning Trading. The November session opened high in the morning, rising by 1.1 qian (candareens), to 569.1 taels. This was largely due to the increase in the big bar by only 1/16th. Silver prices were unchanged, with no changes in European markets. Later, it rose by more than two liang, to 71.6 taels. However, Yu Da, Zhifeng Yong, Fufeng Yong, Yifeng Yong, and others sold heavily. Furthermore, the rumour of British intervention in the silver market, along with weakening local draft demand, led to a precipitous decline of 4-5 taels, causing the premium to increase by 125. The U.S. dollar rose by 25, while the Japanese yen fell by 75. The price fell to 66.4 taels, then added to 7.12 taels, and the internal premium was considerably strained. Sumitomo sold January at 7.5 bianshi (cents). Banks then traded December at 5.625, leading to a further drop of more than four taels. At 10 o'clock, it was 63.1 taels. However, Yuan Maoyong and others continued to buy actively, and commodity hedgers also made deposits, so it recovered slightly by two liang, reaching 65.1 taels around 11 o'clock, with fluctuations of about one tael. After that, selling continued, and British gold strengthened further. The settlement price for October was 7.4375 bianshi, and futures could be purchased at 625. As a result, investor confidence was greatly shaken, and the price plummeted to 61 taels at 11:45. The market closed at noon at 62.1 taels, and the price was revised to 621 taels. The Japanese yen was reduced by 75, initially at 54 taels, but fell sharply to 60 taels at noon.</p>
<p>Consecutive Low Prices in Afternoon Session. The afternoon session opened at 61.8 taels, then added one liang, to 1.78 taels, as small investors bought. However, as Indian exchange rates reported large fluctuations, investor confidence weakened immediately, and the price plunged to 60.05 taels. In a flash, Yuxing Yong and others followed, causing it to soar by three liang, to 2.23 taels at 2:20. However, banks were reported to be trading December British gold at 7.625 bianshi and November at 5.625, so the price retreated to 62 taels. Hengxing, Yuan Cheng Yong and other firms then entered the market to buy, and Li and Mitsui also traded December at 7.5625 bianshi, and commodity inflows also came in. By 3 o'clock, the price jumped to 64.4 taels. Suddenly, because Zhifeng Yong and others sold, the price receded by more than one liang. However, fluctuations of one liang were still common. Around 3:30, Indian exchange rates continued to rise, so the price had fallen to 62.3 taels. After a short time, Yu Da, Yuan Cheng Yong, and others bought together, and the price rose by two liang. After a short time, it was 64.2 taels. However, Da Decheng and others sold quite a bit, and the exchange rate was loose and unstable, and investor sentiment was uncertain. Eventually, it was showing signs of potential downside, and at 4:30, the closing price was 63.3 taels, and continued downward with a small decline after that. Within three liang, it was down 4.7 taels compared to the day before. The highest price of the day was 71.6 taels, and the lowest price was 64.05 taels, a difference of 11.1 taels, which was considered huge. The quotation was reduced by 60 taels, to 578 taels, the posting on the books (registration) 66-62 taels, the water supplement (margin replenishment) was 66 in the morning, and 67 in the afternoon. Commodities in the morning were at 69.3 taels, the afternoon market closed at 61.8 taels, at 1.6, then at 3.2 for the close of the market.</p>
<p>Trading Activity Among Various Firms. Trading activity was chaotic and inconsistent among various firms. In general, selling was more common, as major investors were shorting. It was rumored that Qiao Ribu had sold more than 4,000 bars, and Zhifeng Yong, Yu Da, Yifeng Yong, Yuanyuan Xing, Fu Chang, Fufeng Yong, Han Heng, Fu Yu, Changsheng Yong, Yong Cheng Chang, Chengfeng Yong, and Yu Da Yong were all in short positions. Yong Kang, Tai Feng Cheng, Yi Yu, Yuan Cheng Yong, Shun Li, Yi Xing, Heng Xing, Cui Chang, Heng Xing Yuan, Yuan Mao Yong, and hedgers all bought. Da Decheng, Tai Kang Run, Xie Yu, Chun Yuan Yong, Yuan Cheng, and Yuan Cheng Yong had uncertain inflows and outflows. Hengxing, Bing Xing, Yuan Cheng Yong, Yuanyuan Xing, Yu Da, and Yuxing Yong were all depositing in the afternoon, while Zhifeng Yong, Da Decheng, Yuan Mao Yong, and Xie Yu were all selling. Shun Li, Sen Chang Yong, Yi Xing, etc. had occasional inflows and outflows. Other firms had frequent inflows and outflows, with much divergence. Dalian firms bought 2,600-2,700 bars and sold 1,600-1,700 bars. Guangdong firms had no large amounts, but there were occasional inflows and outflows. Commodity hedgers were bringing in a lot, it was said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange is Loose Both Openly and Implicitly</h3>
<p>Slightly More Active Trading in British Gold: Mostly Chinese Merchants Making Deposits. Yesterday, overseas silver markets were stable, and exchange rates rose slightly. There were no increases or decreases in Yokohama and Kobe. HSBC’s exchange rates have been lengthened half a stop for the various exchanges, with British gold lengthened by 125 to 1 shilling 7 bianshi, the U.S. dollar lengthened by 25 to 38.5 yuan, the Indian lengthened by 0.5 yuan to 106.5 rupees, the French franc lengthened by 6 yuan to 980 yuan, the German exchange lengthened by 1 yuan to 161.5 marks, the Singapore exchange reduced by 1 liang to 147 liang, the Japanese and European exchange lengthened by 0.5 yuan to 95.25 shield, the Hong Kong exchange lengthened by 5 qian to 82.5 taels, and the Japanese gold reduced by 75 to 1 liang 2 qian 8 fen. The trend of the internal premium was also loose. The market was still flat in the morning, but it declined later. It was flat in the afternoon, and compared with the day before, the British gold lengthened by 125, the U.S. dollar lengthened by 25, and the Japanese gold reduced by 0.1125. This was likely due to the continued decline of the gold market, and the inclination of major investors to sell. Speculators were heavily shorting, and the market atmosphere was poor. There was a trend for large bars to be held long. As for Chinese merchant trading, it was still active, with deposits being made. However, banks were constantly supplying it. Over 100,000 pounds of British gold were deposited. Li and Huabi Sumitomo all sold, and various lines are mutually doing one hundred thousand pounds, also from Li and Huabi occupied the main selling places. Also, 100,000 U.S. dollars were mutually traded, Chinese merchants had a few sales and deposits, and the picture of the Japanese gold being stagnant, was only that Sumitomo slightly sold, and investor sentiment declined. Market conditions have been latent and weak. The trading in Ying Hui(British gold) within the market was very lively with a spread of 0.1875. The morning quotation for October was 1 shilling 7 bianshi 25, November 3125, December 375, January 4375, and the buying price was an additional 0625.

<h3>The Price of Silver Rose Again</h3>

<h3>The Stable Trend After the Fall of Silver Tael</h3>
<p>Market Overview: After the silver tael had risen repeatedly for several weeks, it stood firm for a long time. Then, a few days ago (end of last month), it suddenly plummeted. The intensity of the reaction was even greater than the rise. By yesterday, the market seemed to have stabilized, but it was still slightly higher than the low price of the previous day's midday market. Observing the trend of supply and demand, it is generally in balance now. Even if there are shortages, they are not as disparate as before. However, due to demand, the silver market is still weak and it is difficult to rise steadily. Yesterday, it still seemed soft and sluggish, with no vitality, which is worrying.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates: (Silver Tael) The morning and midday prices were both 729.5, which was 1.5 higher than the previous day's midday low. However, it was more than half a point lower than the price a few days ago. In short, the previous rise was unexpected, and the current fall was also unpredictable. The current market price is expected to stabilize officially. (Silver Exchange) The morning silver exchange was 6%, and the midday rate weakened by another 1%, to only 5%. There were also signs of overissuance of "劃頭", so they were opened without adding water. Banks did not post rates.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: The situation for Jiangnan small silver coins remained unchanged. The morning and midday prices were both 654. The morning price was the same as the previous day's morning price. The trading volume was 3,000 "角" in the morning and 2,000 "角" in the afternoon. The morning price for Guangdong small silver coins was 636, and the midday price was 637. As a result, it rose 2 "厘" compared to the previous day's midday price, and the situation also stabilized. The trading volume was 110,000 "角" in the morning and 80,000 "角" in the afternoon. Copper coins remained at 383,000 "文", with a trading volume of more than 33,000 strings.</p>
<p>Inflow and Outflow of Silver and Foreign Currencies: (Silver) Yesterday's market saw banks receiving and delivering more funds than usual due to the aftereffects of the previous day. Chinese merchants received and delivered drafts worth 2.56 million, and foreign merchants received and delivered drafts worth more than 2 million. The total receipts and deliveries for Chinese and foreign banks were 2-3 million. Special receipts and deliveries were 800-900 thousand. Various cargo, tax, and miscellaneous receipts and deliveries were 8.6-8.7 million. 800,000 was taken out of the warehouse, and 600,000 was put into the warehouse. The Japanese Bank received and delivered 4.2 million of various funds, and 500,000 was taken out of the warehouse. Money shops and silver firms received and delivered 33.3 million. "劃頭" 款 receipts and deliveries were 4.1 million, and remittances from various routes were 700,000. Cash receipts were 700,000-800,000. (Foreign Currencies) Remittance drafts had a volume of 1.03 million in the morning and 565,000 in the afternoon. There was no transaction in banknotes in the morning, and 30,000 was done in the afternoon. Over-the-counter banknotes were 145,000 in the morning and 65,000 in the afternoon. New currency transactions were 70,000-80,000 in both markets. Bank transactions were 500,000 in the morning interbank market and 550,000 in the afternoon. Transactions between foreign accounts of various banks totaled 1.5 million, and the inflow and outflow of banknotes were 1.3-1.4 million. Money shops received and delivered 4.5 million, "劃頭" 款 receipts and deliveries were 2.1 million, and loans of foreign currencies were 1.3 million. Smaller firms did transactions in remittances, banknotes, new currencies, etc., worth 60,000-70,000. Influx from elsewhere was over 1 million, and withdrawals were 300,000.</p>
<h3>Last Month's Deposit Interest Rate at 2.95 Tael Discount</h3>
<p>In the first half of last month (September), the silver market was very loose, with frequent white loans or 2-3%. In the second half of the month, the market was around 1%, but it was often at several points. Therefore, the total silver discount for the entire month was only 2.03 taels. The average for 30 days was only 6.767 "厘" per day. However, the agreed price for monthly deposit interest rates has always been based on the level of silver discount. Since the silver discount is now small, the base price cannot be high. Therefore, the public agreed the previous day to maintain the deposit interest rate at a 2.95 tael discount, and the overdue interest will also be added according to the usual practice, with 4.5 taels as the base. In this case, the highest price is still in the range of 10.05 taels.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Market Inactive, Prices Stable</h3>
<p>Although various government bond spot goods were opened yesterday, the transaction volume was still very scarce. The futures market was also quieter than the previous day. The bond market was calm, supply and demand were balanced, and fluctuations were minimal. As a result, there were mixed gains and losses compared to the previous day. Except for the customs tax reduction, demobilization, and consolidation of the sixth issue spot goods, which were about 1 yuan higher than last week, the other changes were only a few "角". The total spot goods for the whole day were 12,500 yuan. The futures volume was more than 3.6 million in the morning and only about 3 million in the afternoon, totaling more than 6.6 million. Among them, only demobilization was good, and the 19th issue of biên qiǎn was not deserted. All others were very quiet.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Yarn Market Very Mediocre</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weak and sluggish, mainly due to the overall situation being depressed. The price of Eastern Ocean's Third Grade yarn plummeted, so people's expectations are low. The current demand for yarn is relatively quiet, and British factories are taking the opportunity to release large quantities, about more than 10,000 bales. With this huge amount of spot goods, sellers are becoming more and more calm. Therefore, the Chaozhou gang has a deep desire to short, and a large manufacturer has a calm mind. Only a small part is extremely bullish. However, the global situation is not good, and it is difficult to rise alone. Most buyers need to see the development of large-scale sales after the holidays.</p>
<p>"人標" Dropped by 80-90 "錢": The opening price of the "人標" market was slightly looser than the previous day because a large number of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd yarn were released. There was a lack of buyers, and prices fell by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 "錢". In the afternoon, it was heard that the demand for spot yarn was not smooth and the price of Third Grade yarn plummeted again. As a result, people's hearts were empty and the market was even weaker. Prices fell by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 "錢". The total trading volume for the whole day was 10,950 bales. It was found that Yi Yu sold 1,200 bales, Da Feng 950 bales, Mao Ji 450 bales, Shen Chang 500 bales, and the rest ranged from 250 to 400 bales. Yi Chang bought 750 bales, Gong Tai 550 bales, Rong Xing 550 bales, Tian Cheng 500 bales, and the rest ranged from 200 to 300 bales. The closing prices of "人標" are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>December 1525 - 8 - 37,950 - March 1531 - 8 - 450</p>
<p>Spot Sales Improved Slightly: Spot yarn sales were better. It was found that all the "帮" bought a total of 1,175 bales for the whole day. Xu Zhou took in 185 bales, Sichuan took in 320 bales, Hankou took in 150 bales, Shantou took in 90 bales, Xiamen took in 65 bales, Guangdong took in 230 bales, and miscellaneous "帮" took in 135 bales. The market was generally flat.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Re-enters Slump</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton telegram showed a slight increase, but the local cotton market was slightly weak. In fact, current demand is light. Various factories are absorbing a huge amount of foreign cotton, and the position of domestic cotton is being encroached upon. Therefore, it is very difficult to continue to rise. In the end, it is still difficult to be optimistic at present because the new cotton season has not yet peaked, the supply is not smooth, and farmers are holding tight. It is heard that large quantities of both Indian and American cotton will arrive in Shanghai in December, and the changes at that time are feared to be significant.</p>
<p>"標棉" Fell by Two "錢": The opening price of the "漢標" market was flat due to the U.S. cotton market situation, and buying interest was light. Prices fell by 5 "分" to 1 "錢". The market remained weak in the afternoon, and prices fell again by 5 "分" to 1 "錢". The total transaction volume for the whole day was 23,700 "擔". It was found that Chang Feng sold 2,800 bales, Yong Feng 1,200 "擔", Jin Feng 1,500 "擔", Geng Feng 1,300 "擔", Rui Da 1,400 "擔", Yi Cheng 1,100 "擔", Yuan Tai 1,500 "擔", and the rest ranged from 500 to 1,000 "擔". Yuan Da bought 2,600 "擔", Rong Xing 1,300 "擔", and Da Chang Cheng 1,200 "擔", and the rest ranged from 600 to 1,000 "擔". The closing prices of "漢標" are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Current Cotton Mill Demand is Sparse: Spot cotton transactions turned flat. The factories did not take in large quantities. The sources were 40 bales of Yao cotton and 420 bales of Tongzhou cotton. The report yesterday that Shenxin Factory took in 5,000 pieces of Shaanxi cotton was inaccurate.</p>
<p>Only 2,000 bales of small packages of local cotton were taken in, priced at 32 taels and 2.5 "錢". Spot goods were delivered to the factory.</p>

<h3>U.S. Cotton Diverges from Third Grade</h3>
<p>U.S. Cotton Trend Continues to be Firm: Yesterday, U.S. cotton initially rose due to good news from Liverpool, then weakened due to the lack of confidence on Wall Street, and finally strengthened again due to short covering. Futures rose by 4-10 points, and spot goods rose by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 6-7 points, and spot goods rose by 10 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 15 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (2nd telegram).</p>

<h3>Grain: Rice Market Continues to Fall by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, there were fewer boats from various "帮", about 30. Market sales were sluggish. Although the arrival of new Japonica rice was thin, the river stock was still thick, so the market continued to fall by a small half yuan. High-grade goods opened at 16 yuan and 5 "角", and ordinary goods opened at 15 yuan and 8-9 "角". The Dongxin Factory slightly increased sales, but the number of sales was not large, and the price was also weak by 2-3 "角". Early rice opened high at 16 yuan, but the transaction was sparse and the market was in poor shape. The source of broken Japonica rice was very dry, and this kind of declining goods is about to disappear. The overall market was flat, and special top-grade goods were around 19 yuan and 6-7 "角", middle-grade goods were 17 yuan and 5 "角". Du Zi Xian rice had weak buying interest and the arrival of goods was still being received, with a small decrease of 4 "角". It opened at 13 yuan. Yang Jian only opened at 12 yuan and 7-8 "角". Because there was a rumor of stabilization in the production of Ke Jian rice, the goods owners seemed to be holding back. The price was short by 2-3 "角", and opened high at around 11 yuan. The down-stream city of Bu Jian continued to report a decline, and the market demand was not good, falling by more than 3 "角", opening at 11 yuan and 3-4 "角". The inflow and sales of Bai Yuan rice were not strong, and the top-grade goods were 17 yuan and 6 "角".</p>
<p>Hunan: Yesterday, there were 20-30 boats arriving at the river. The sales market in this street was limited. Because the weather seemed to be rainy, all parties were not in a hurry to take action, so the transaction was sluggish and the price continued to soften. The new Japonica rice of Chang "幫" was similar to that of Hubbei, opening high at 16 yuan and 4-5 "角", falling by 4-5 "角". The new Japonica rice of Su Tong "幫" and the surrounding areas was more than half a yuan higher, with the highest being 14 yuan and 5 "角" to 14 yuan. The special top-grade goods of Yang Du Jian opened at 11 yuan and 7-8 "角", with a decrease of more than 4 "角". The situation was extremely lifeless. Xin Jian store's demand was weak, and the market was gradually decreasing, with the overall market at 10 yuan and 6-7 "角".</p>
<h3>This Month's Flour Fell by Three "分"</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, the May market was initially stable. However, after the second round, this month's market suddenly fluctuated. Because most of the large number of warehouse receipts from the previous month had not been cleared by the bulls, the goods from those receipts were the accumulated goods when they were new flour. After several months of storage, the quality of the flour was inevitably slightly changed. Therefore, the customers generally did not care about selling those warehouse receipts, which made the large households inevitably panic. Therefore, they sold a large amount of the standards for this month to avoid further loss. The factories with goods were still continuously clearing their positions, because the higher the price, the more chances they had to dump. Therefore, this month's market fell sharply step by step. A certain factory also stopped maintaining and secretly dumped wildly, so the market was very weak and fell into the 4 "錢" mark. If there is no way out for this market, the bulls will inevitably suffer losses. As a result, this month's market fell by 3 "分" compared to the previous day, November's market fell by 1 "分" and 7.5 "厘", December's market fell by 1 "分", and March's market fell by 1.5 "分" and 1.75 "厘".</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Market Unanimously Downstream</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after opening in the morning, because the foreign wheat price was still good by about 4 "角", people's hearts were once excited. However, later, because the flour price was not good, and those who had already established short positions in foreign wheat saw this high price and dumped wildly again, the market appeared to be weak again. In the afternoon, it was reported that the flour market would collapse because the customer sales were not good. As a result, the selling pressure for each month became very smooth, and the market also fell sharply step by step. This kind of non-constant reversal is because people's hearts have gone astray and it is difficult to grasp. As a result, this month's market fell by 7 "分" compared to the previous day, November's market fell by 8 "分", December's market fell by 4 "分", February's market fell by 6 "分", and March's market fell by 5 "分". The current wheat market, because the factory demand is still good, the various "當" had ups and downs. The medium and next grade goods will eventually be killed. 13,000 bags of Shandong Hongri wheat, Haizhou Daoren, Qiao Dongtai, and Yao Wan resident horse shop wheat were all handled by Fuxin.</p>
<h3>Ke (客) Xian (秈) Has Sales to Xiamen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of Ke Xian rice was not much, and the customer's turn-over was still active. The market seemed to have a good outlook, but it was crushed by the newly arrived Saigon rice, and the market was unable to turn better. In addition to this street, Xiamen "幫" was also procuring 200-300 bags of Jiangxi and Wuhu rice each. Therefore, people's hearts were still good. The total sales were 1,500 bags of Jiangxi machine early rice, priced at 11 yuan to 10 yuan and 6 "角", and 600 bags of machine late rice, priced at 12 yuan to 11 yuan and 6.5 "角", and 100 bags of machine Yuan rice, priced at 13 yuan and 8 "角" to 13 yuan and 6 "角". 300 bags of Wuhu machine rice, priced at 10 yuan. Foreign rice has not yet been completely loaded onto the wharf, and no transactions have been made.</p>
<h3>Standard Term Soybean Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Dalian Yuan soybeans, because the Lian market reported upward again for December term, various parties entered actively and smoothly. Both the street and the factories have active purchasing intentions, so prices continued to rise by 3-4 "分" in the afternoon. At the moment, the standard terms in both markets are more than 1 "錢" higher, which is the result of a long-term fatigue situation. Once it is launched, the market will become more and more tight. The closing price was 4 taels and 9 "錢" and 2 "分", which was 4 "分" better than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Milan Italian Cocoon Price Falls Again</h3>
<p>The various silks in the Milan market are because the European sales of Italian silk are trending towards stagnation, the stock of silk is increasing day by day, most of the factories are reducing labor and stopping the machines, and the sales of dry cocoon factories are even more lifeless. The cocoon price is falling step by step. Last week, the spring dry cocoon was only 84 lira, the summer cocoon was 76 lira, and the autumn cocoon was 61 lira, falling another 1-2 lira. The trend is still difficult to stand up.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firm Silk Sales Increasingly Sparse</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign firm silk market in Shanghai became increasingly sparse, because all the silk factories in Shanghai had announced that they had stopped business, the factory silk had no market, and the telegrams for European and American silk were still not turning to Shanghai. The European firms' purchase demand was increasingly quiet. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others took in 30 packages of Sichuan yellow raw silk, and Boxing and others took in 11 packages of yellow raw silk. The prices were generally flat and weak.</p>
<h3>High-Grade Zhen (珍) Mei (眉) Tea Had Slight Sales to France</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign firm tea market in Shanghai, Baochang, Tianxiang, Tongfu, and other companies had slightly increased demand for high-grade Zhen Mei green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other routes. The Lu (路) Zhuang (庄) "抽芯" tea was offered at 220 taels, which was still quite firm compared to the previous day. However, the supply of medium and low-grade tea exceeded demand, and there was no way to reverse the decline. The tea prices opened recently are lower than before, and there is no hope of rebound within the year. The black tea market is even more stagnant, and there is no news of the British and Russian firms moving.</p>
<h3>Cotton Piece Goods: Bao Zi (包子) Tribute (貢) in Short Supply</h3>
<p>Local Factory Cloth: Yesterday's trend was chaotic, fine cloth was weak and sales were very quiet. Coarse cloth was smooth and there was a lack of spot goods. Hubei Tian (天) character cloth was sold to 8 taels and 2 "錢" because of the rare arrival. The Guang "帮" sold more than 200 pieces of 11-pound Three Rabbit Three Deer cloth yesterday, so it was 1 "錢" and 7.5 "分" higher than the usual brands. 13-pound coarse cloth was purchased by the Jiangxi "帮" yesterday for 100 pieces. Spot goods of Double Horse, Horse Dog were also in short supply. The coarse material patterns' purchase demand of Bei (北) "帮" turned active. Yesterday, the Tianjin "帮" took in 150 pieces of Three Rabbit Three Fish Cat and British brands, so the market was slightly firm. Fine twill continued to rise, Yang Crane had opened at 7 taels 3 "錢" and 2.5 "分", and Blue Double Fish was also 7 taels "出關", exceeding the fine cloth by 3-4 "錢".</p>
<p>Eastern and Western Piece Goods: Eastern goods were soft because the Third Grade market was soft, and because the holiday season was approaching, the rising trend had flattened. Each of the tribute woolens and tribute satins fell slightly. The price of fine serge was slightly closer, so the Huxinting had placed orders for 300-400 pieces in the past few days, with a price of 3 "錢" to 2 "錢" and 9.5 "分". Yue Hua: Yesterday, black flower middle flower slightly fell because of the silver loan relationship. The printing thread, which was once very popular, also turned weak yesterday. Those who previously opened at 2 "錢" and 3.5 "分" are now selling at 2 "錢" and 3 "分" to 2 "錢" and 2.5 "分". However, the new flower pattern Bao Zi (包子) Tribute (貢) is still extremely firm, and there is a state of supply exceeding demand after the arrival of the goods. In addition to the local cloth stores and shops, Shantou, Zhenjiang, Ningbo, and other "帮" are also quite smooth. Rong Hua Fu Gui is most brightly sold at 2 "錢" and 8.5 "分", and Shou Lao Qi Lu is 2 "錢" and 7.5 "分", which is more than 1 "錢" higher than the most tired time in the spring.</p>
<h3>Woolens and Flannels Selling Well in Time</h3>
<p>Woolen goods and flannels are in the selling season, and the street's customer "帮" are all purchasing. As the weather is getting colder, the actual sales of door shops' retail business and the ordering of suits and coats in Western clothing stores are increasing sharply every day. Goods such as straight expensive, serge, Watt flannel, satin, chocolate, pattern flannel, and deer goods such as Eldon, plain thick flannel,夾呢camel wool, sable leopard skin, Black Qín, sea tiger velvet, colorful flash color and sperm coat flannel, shoe felt, etc. are also traded very heavily every day. Each store's order to the foreign firm to deliver the goods is very crowded.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Dried Lychee Sales Stagnant</h3>
<p>Australian goods were all losing money. Jian goods were also difficult to calculate. Dried lychee has been quite stagnant recently due to the listing of longan, and the source is also very rare. Except for a small number of Jinshan branches and Shuidong branches arriving one after another, the rest such as Lanzhu branches and Wuye branches have not arrived. According to Xiamen's news, the land price is standing firm and there is a lack of loosening hopes. Although the land price in Hong Kong and Guangdong has softened, it is ultimately not cost-effective. Therefore, the self-organized number shops have suffered losses before and after opening. The Jian "帮" number shops have not opened for a long time, because the sales are not moving. The current market price for Jin Chushi is 27-28 taels, and the selection of Lanzhu is 29 taels and 5 "分", with inconsistent grades. The market is flat and tired.</p>
<h3>Raw Starch Market Plate Downward Fatigue</h3>
<p>Recently, the arrival of raw starch has gradually increased, and it is heard that the prices of production areas have dropped by 1.5 "盾", and the customer's traffic has become quiet. The market plate of the trading houses has been consistently falling. At the moment, the trading houses are selling European brand eleven taels, Guoqi (國旗) brand eight taels, Qingta (靑塔) Sanyu (三魚) brand seven taels and eight or nine "錢", Hongsanxia (紅三蝦) brand five taels and three "錢", Heisanshou (黑三手) brand five taels to four taels and seven or eight "錢", Dongyang cargo small package eleven taels and eight "錢", large package eleven taels and two "錢". The demand in the various ports of the Yangtze River is weak, but the sanitary business is still hot. However, there are only scattered transactions and a lack of wholesale traffic. Therefore, the market becomes oversupplied, and the amount of storage is increasing day by day.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Market Still Quiet</h3>
<p>The Kobe Sugar Factory's Plate is Rarely Inquired About: Yesterday's sugar market's production area telegram showed the current sugar price in Zhanba was 109375, which was slightly higher than the previous telegram by 0.0625. The New York sugar futures December price was 1.06, down by 2 "分", the next year's March price was 1.17, and the May price was 1.25, both without ups and downs. The September price was 1.37, also down by 1 "分". The Java current sugar price was 8.125, and the futures sugar October price was 8.00, both down by 1.25. November was 8.00 and December was 7.875, both without up or down. The local chamber of commerce market disk, Dutch sugar 24 white granulated sugar, buying interest is still sparse. New goods coarse white granulated sugar eight taels, Chen goods seven taels and eight "錢", 18 medium white granulated sugar seven taels and seven "錢", transactions scattered, the market is still weak. Because of the arrival of Dutch red sugar, the market is also slightly flat. Japanese sugar N mark shouted a price of eight taels, YP eight taels, VT mark seven taels and eight "錢" and a half, F mark eight taels and one "錢", SH mark seven taels and eight "錢", also rarely asked about. The factory disk Kobe four yuan factory is still rarely received, because the market inventory is thin, but the sales are very slow, so the traders' purchasing intention is very weak. The number shop has the factory's Binghua (氷花) Qing price opened at seven taels and six "錢", which was sold by Zhenxiang (禎祥) number, 200 bags of Cuban foreign sugar, priced at six taels and eight "錢", each falling one "錢" compared to the previous disk, and the market is also weak. Spot 24 Chen coarse white granulated sugar also sold 400 bags, priced at seven taels and eight "錢" and a half, and oil bags were seven taels and seven "錢", the market atmosphere is still dark and lacking energy.</p>

<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>The Paris Grand Theater announces that it will begin showing the Wufa Company's epic film "The History of the Barber" today. The film stars Werner Krauss, a male star comparable to Emil Jannings, and the beautiful and talented female star Jenny Jugo. It tells the story of a performer's love affair. The plot is full of twists and turns, with humorous and lively interludes, truly resembling "The Four Heavenly Kings" in its uniqueness. This is a rare silent epic film of modern times. In addition, the Montmartre Dance Troupe has been specially retained to perform on stage for one day as a farewell tribute.</p>
<p>The Mingxing Film Company announces that the Minzhong National Sound Film Company's first domestic sound film, "Songstress Red Peony," after months of preparation and careful design, began filming at the beginning of last month by the producer, our company. Filming has been proceeding day and night, and half of the film is now complete. It is expected to be completed in the shortest possible time, bringing this all-singing, all-dancing, all-dialogue domestic sound film to domestic and foreign audiences who have been longing for it for a long time. The main character, the songstress Red Peony, is played by the famous actress Hu Die. The other supporting actors are all well-known.</p>
<p>The Zhongshan Grand Theater announces that the Mingxing film "A Red Egg," which began showing yesterday, is, as the name suggests, a social comedy. However, upon seeing its content, it is actually a touching tragedy. The performance is so realistic that it feels like it actually happened. Viewers can understand the emotions and identify with the characters throughout. Zhou Wenshu plays a middle-aged woman, and her every move exudes the demeanor of a virtuous mother in an old family. The makeup is excellent, surpassing all others. The theater was almost full yesterday, both day and night. The 2,000 red eggs prepared will continue to be given away today.</p>
<p>The Wanguo Film Company announces that since its internal reorganization, its performance has been remarkable. Investors have been very enthusiastic, the capital is sufficient, and the scope has been greatly expanded. The film "Night of Terror," which is mostly completed, has been rushed to completion recently. The second production, "Hero," a martial arts fantasy film with gadgets written by the playwright Li Changjian, has been completed and is now being equipped with special costumes and props and can be filmed soon.</p>
