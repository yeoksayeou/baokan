<p>倫敦海會後之各國造艦</p>
<p>倫敦之海軍會議。為縮减海軍軍備之會議也。然自五强國會議。不幸而僅成英美日三國之協定。法意因爭噸位之故。致未能有所成就。已非初願矣。且因此而法意之間。更生重大之齟龉。其前途至可想像。其後協定之國。有依協定而改變其造艦之程序。有因協定而更計其國防之新計畫。雖有縮减軍備之形。而仍念念不忘充實其戰鬥之力。其於縮减軍備之初意。甚不符矣。至於海軍五强國以外。平時不聞致力於海軍之國。今且亦躍躍欲試之象。據今日所傳之外。電葡萄牙造艦程序。正在編制之中。定六千萬美金之經费。計</p>
<p>八年之歲月。建造巡洋艦二。驅逐艦十二。潛艇十二。飛機母艦一。砲艦二。又據里加通訊。蘇俄自五月間派兩戰艦至黑海後。繼續猛速從事武装。以期恢復波維的海之覇權。新造二萬六千噸無畏艦弗隆士號。近始完工。又開始建造九百噸潛水艇四艘。其海軍力。計有二萬六千噸無畏艦三艘。巡洋艦一艘。毀滅艦三十二艘。潛水艇十艘。其戰鬥力實超過波繀的海各國戰艦之總力云云。是則今後各國海軍軍備之競爭。尚方與而未有艾也。</p>

<p>中華民國十九年七月八日（申報第二張）			接國際要訊 　　（八）反俄聯合戰線			　　　　白里安的歐聯計劃、加入的國家、以國際聯盟會員成爲限、蘇聯未加入國際聯盟	故難在歐洲佔有廣大國土、却被　於全	歐聯盟之外、無論白里安爲有意的或無意的、在蘇聯政府看來、歐聯運動、却完全是爲對俄而發、换句話説、就是歐洲資本主義國家、應築成反俄的聯合戰線、藉以撲滅共産主義的國家、因此蘇聯對於此種計劃、當然表示反對、反對的方法、除宣傅外、就是暗中拆台、拉攏歐洲一部分國家、使歐聯不能實現、據近日消息、俄德兩國政府、將於本月中旬在莫斯科召集會議、表面的目的、是爲解决俄德兩國間的懸案、實際上則爲增進俄德友誼、使德國不致加入反俄戰線、據説德國對白里安計劃書的覆文中、將申説俄國地位的重要、如俄國不加入聯盟、將有多種困難云云、平心而論、俄國在歐洲所佔領土、幾達全歐面積之半、全歐聯盟假如没有俄國加入在内、當然不易成事、若令俄國加入、則又爲事實上所不可能、這也是歐聯前途的一大困難、		（九）英國加入歐聯乎		再就聯盟内部説、依然有很多的問題、第一是英國、白里安的計劃書中、當然希望英國加入、但英國的本國領土雖在歐洲　究是一個世界帝國、牠的自治屬地殖民地、廣佈於世界各處、性質與其餘歐洲國家完全不同、换句話説、英國的主要利益、在於廣佈亞非美澳各洲的不列顛廢地及殖民地、並不完全在於歐洲、英國加入歐聯、是否有利於本國、是否不至引起其海外屬地的反感、實是一個疑問、英國對於歐洲大陸、向來探取所謂「光榮的孤立」政策、就是不願插入大陸政治中間、在大戰後、英國加入國際聯盟、加入羅加諾協定、孤立政策、雖然已漸漸放棄、但把牠自己的散沙般的海外屬地棄置不顧、而揰身於歐洲聯盟、却爲英國大部分的與論所不許、近來英國爲救濟工業衰頽及失業恐慌起見、正在努力謀英帝國内各屬地殖民地的經濟的聯結、因此對於歐聯、不會有多大熱心、保守黨與工當報紙、對於白里安計劃、雖表面贊揚、但都説難於實現、可見其熊度之冷淡、只有自由黨則因歐聯或可促成歐洲國家間的自由貿易、至少可以减低歐洲税壁、有利於英國工業、故與以相當的歡迎、就目前情形、全歐聯盟即使成立、英國能否加入、却大是問題呢、		（十）法意的爭覇		　　但全歐聯盟的内部最大的困難、却是意大利的熊度、當白里安計劃書送達各國政府的時侯、正是慕沙里尼在佛羅稜斯發表重要的政治演説之日、這次法西斯蒂領袖的非常謊誕的演説、頗惹動全歐與論界、因爲這演説完全帶着挑戰的論調、自從倫敦會議以後、法意感情愈弄愈壞、意國要在地中海及巴爾幹稱覇、不能	不和法國利益衝突、歐聯旣是由法國方面發起、在意大利看來、完全是法國想獨攬大陸覇權的一衝企圖、與從前梅特湼的神聖同盟、俾士麥的三皇同盟、並無二致、所以意大利報紙對於白里安的計劃書、不但不加贊揚、且表示非常懷疑、如法意兩國的衝突不能解决、我們可以相信、全歐聯盟斷無成立之可能、						（十一）德國的熊度						除英法意以外、歐聯中最重要的國家、當然是德國了、德國對於白里安計劃、大體是贊同的、但就一般與論、則德國要求修		改凡爾賽條約中的屈辱條欵後、方可加入歐聯、因爲不然、德國不能與其餘聯盟國立於平等地位、但因全歐聯盟而牵動和約、必爲法國所不許、本來法國發起全	歐聯盟直接以謀歐陸的穏定、間接以謀鞏固其大戰所得的勝利、反之德國則頗思利用這個機會以增加其國際地位、就這一點、法德兩國是不會不起爭執的、此外德國也擔心歐聯將成爲法國大陸帝國主義的工具、尤其是假如英國不加入歐聯則德國在歐聯中的地位、完全孤立、一	不免被法國把持、所以德國的態度、也是切頗可注意的、		（十二）吾人的反省				　　全歐聯盟能否成爲事實、或者這種大規模的聯邦組織、能實現到何種程度、在現在加以推測、還嫌過早、但是歐聯計劃、將成爲最近的將來的國際政治上一種有力的運動、則已不能否認了、原來在現代政治的經濟的互相掠奪競逐的局勢下、一個國家、内部不統一强固、固然難以圖存、即使内部統一了、强固了、而對外並無圑結、孤立無援、也還是不能立足、因此現代國家、都就共同利益的基礎上、結成許多集圑、不列顛帝國與其廣大的海外屬地殖民地是一個集圑、由北美合衆國與中南美各共和國聯結而成的汎美同盟、是又一個集圑、由歐亞七個蘇維埃共和國聯結而成的蘇維埃聯盟、也是一個集圑、現在這全歐聯盟、如一旦成爲事實、則又産出一個新的國家集圑、如此則現在世界的國家民族、差不多都在地域或政治組織的範圍内各自圑结起來、一方面防衞圑體内部的利益、一方面向圑體以外的國家掠取、現在只剩下東方亞洲的國家、殖民地半殖民地内的弱小民族、還是和散沙一般、不能圑結起來、	所以這白里安的一紙文書、頗足以引起吾人無窮的反省（六月十四日自巴黎寄）			　　要聞		中央與國府之紀念週 　　中央黨部　中央黨部、於七日上午九時在大禮堂擧行第六十七次總理紀念週、到中央委員孫科·陳果夫·劉蘆隠·陳立夫·克興額·苗培成等、各部處會職員及來賓等、約五六百人、孫科主席、行禮後、劉蘆隠報告、略謂自三全大會决議提倡三民主義的文學、使一般靑年同志、以所具之感覺與思想、於學術作具體之表現、		數月以來、經本黨切實研究、並由胡委員漢民、本此名詞、提出實行方案、葉委員		楚傖、亦曾作一論文以表示意見、本席以爲提倡此種文學之目的、在能代表中華民族、發揚優越文化、比世界文學中有特殊精粹、使人羨慕與佩服、且能適應社會民族一切之要求、而達其一致之願望、尤	其是此種文學、係以三民主義爲主要立塲、而實行方法、則在本黨同志、能融會而貫通之、若認爲係一派所創造、或視爲刻版文章、則見解乃大誤、如果具此見解、則是立於此種文學以外、而作批評者之	觀察、非居於作品者之地位也、此一要點、必须認識清楚、方克易於推行、有人以爲此是文學界之新創造、頗慮材料之不易尋求、但所謂三民主義、必须將政治經濟社會一切制度及進程、歸納於文學之中、各項建設事業、孕育於文學之内、初非别樹一幟、凡修内政禦外侮、及所見所	聞、國家與人民間中國與他國間所具之現象與事實、如何改進、如何革新俱是文學上之大好資料、並無何種困難也、况中國地大物博、隨時隨地、隨事隨物、咸含有文學意義而與三民主義相脗合、求則得之、不患不足、故本黨同志、當以此文學爲中心勢力、切實担負工作、以期三民主義之迅速成功、永垂不朽、在共産黨所　　倡無産階級學説、譯名爲破落主義、其宣傅力量、不過等於散佈傅單、轉瞬即行消失、若三民主義的文學、一旦發揚中外、則一切異端邪説、不攻自破、報告畢、十時半散會、　　國民政府　同日上午十時、國民政府擧行總理紀念週、到譚延闓·古應芬·馬福祥·蔣夢麟·易培基·王正迁·劉瑞恒·張難先·陳儀·陳紹寛·周亞衛·張我華·陳郁·朱經農·及國府文官參軍兩處職員二百餘人、譚延闦主席、行禮後、由秘書錢昌照報告、略謂軍事方面、隴海平漢兩		路、非常勝利、石逆友三部隊、近乎完全消滅、馮逆玉祥部隊消滅四分之三、開封鄭州、日内可下、津浦路我方防務、十分鞏固、一無足慮、湖南張桂殘逆、被我圍勦、損失甚大、不難肅清、大體觀察起來、軍事不久即能結束、報告畢、散會	賀耀祖在兗北督師 　　曲阜以北戰事頗烈	　　魯西石軍已被擊潰			　　徐州通信、津浦線晋軍現渡河而南者號	稱五軍、每軍兩師、每師三圑、以馮鵬翥部留守濟南傅作義部沿線南下、另以一	部佈防膠濟路線以防東撤之韓軍、現傅部已在曲阜之北與馬鴻逵夏斗寅等部接	觸頃據十五路軍消息、賀耀祖現往來鄒縣兗州之間指揮軍事賀奉令指揮津浦路各軍曾通電謙辭、惟蔣以津浦軍事、甚關重要、已復電賀促即督師前進至曲阜一帶、刻下雖係局部接觸　而戰事頗烈、孔裔孔德成等、昨聯電晋閻　请勿在曲阜作戰、文云「探呈閻總司令鈞鑒、昨今兩日　曲阜聖林附近發生戰事、砲彈槍彈、飛落林内、地關逼近、廟亦震驚危險萬分莫知所措、查耶路撤冷爲歐洲基督聖地、往年歐戰劃在三十里外　萬國均經公認孔聖爲中華文化所關曲阜爲孔聖林廟所在、鈞座尊儒重道、特具熱忱、務望仿照歐洲、將曲阜劃出戰綫之外、幷賜以保護、臨電無任悚惶急切待命之至、曲阜孔德成率孔氏闔族族人曲阜孔敎總會全體會員同叩冬、	隴海前方消息、在路綫以北考城方面之石友三部、於一日起、向中央軍右翼轉取攻勢、進攻魯西、企圖與津浦綫之晉軍、互取聯絡、二日佔踞舊考城之綫、當經中央軍將其包圍、石之另一部份、犯抵曹縣、亦由中央軍追擊、雙方激戰甚烈、石軍卒不能支、至四日完全潰退、據軍方謂隴海右翼之敵以石部爲主力、石旣經此重創、當無攻擊能力矣、			七月五日外交部長王正廷宴全國鐵　　路協會於中央饭店（南京光華攝） 　　　外交部長王正廷	　　	　　　交通部長王伯羣		　　　外部次長李锦綸	濟南政黨近狀 　　靑島通信、頃有自濟南來者、記者叩以該				地情况、據云、自晋軍入濟、各行政機關由德州移省後、山東軍事政治黨務、均呈紛亂狀態、民財兩廳、因遷濟伊始、經費困難、達於極點、辦事諸多棘手、公安局長汪益靜、爲維持警察生活、昨向財政廳請先領經费數百元、以敷衍現狀、亦不可得、其他當可想見、各機關人員、除民財		兩廳長外、其餘各局所主要人員、皆係臨時代理性質、但因頭緖紛雜、有由石友三</p>

<p>自由談付之一笑　　海客·　　僕人-主人　那汽車行中收賬的説。你這支票上還須加簽三元。主人-這是那裏來的話他開來的賑單上。就是這個數目。怎麽好端端的要加出三塊錢來。僕人-主人　他説因爲他已坐等了一點鐘了。　　甲-他是天下第一個忠厚人。一向是與人無爭的。可憐昨天他竟死了。　　乙-可是害了甚麽重病麽。　　甲-不。是因爲與仇人吃茶評理。被打了一頓。傷重而死的。　　甲-你剛纔聽了老丙那種陳腐乏味的老笑話。怎麽大笑特笑。倒像津津有味似的。		　　乙-這是我爲了自衛起見。　　甲-怎麽呌做自衛。　　乙-我要是不笑。他以爲我一時不懂得他笑話中的妙處。一定要翻來覆去。多説幾遍我不要給他麻煩死麽。	小學教員生計難　　近十年間。生活程度。繼長增高。而教育經費。愈形枯竭。一般小學教員。位置雖淸高。然薪給則至薄。處斯環境。何以圖存。因是亟思謀一副業。藉資生活上之貼補。報載蘇城教員。課餘拉車。以執教鞭者。而忽從事苦力工作。宜其生意做不成。反大蝕其本也。小學教員苟須另覓副業。我意應擇輕便者爲之。余之同鄕沈君。曾在五年前充湖屬西南鄕小學教員。昨爲余言彼所經歷。頗多感喟。縱所操課外之業。未可爲法。但説來津津有味。固大足供我人談助也。　　沈君自中學卒業後。因無力進取。遂改充西南鄕小學教員。平均每日授課三小時。而薪水則按月袁頭八尊。沈君月須瞻家六金。雖五年前生活。尙不及現在之高。然所餘甚微。殊不足以供交際洗沐諸費。職是之故。恒鬱鬱不歡。該鄕俗尙迷信。廟宇林立。農夫農婦。燒香祈禱。所需楮箔甚多。生意素號不惡。沈君偶思及此。不禁觸及靈機。欲於此中求一副業。嘗		試之際。先向市上購一木板及若干錫箔黃纸。仿鄕人之法。印糊錫錠。每晚無事。輒私自工作。串成纍纍。挽役售諸各肆。居然成本薄而利尙可觀。大約每月赢餘。可得三元左右。用以貼補費用。自覺略舒。計沈君在該校教授一載有半。所操副業。繼續不輟。達一載之久。後以棄教就商。遂不復向此中討生活。平居每一今及。輒歎小學教員生計艱難不置云。揚州之瞎子赛會　　張炎　　昨讀徐小庭君興化賽會一文。因憶及我揚最饒趣味之瞎子會焉。以瞎子而能賽會。實屬罕聞。爰再録投本談。以博讀者一粲。　　揚州因兩淮鹽務之盛。故富裕之家獨多。而姬妾亦因此綦衆。一般姨太太。大小姐。小不遂意。辄喜招瞎先生談談。因此四方之瞎來歸。彷彿羣賢畢至。在最盛時期。城裏關外之瞎子。竟有百餘名之多。現雖减去一半。而一部分之勢力仍在。前此賽都天會。各業均能參加。獨瞎子被屏棄不用。於是衆瞎子憤憤不平。特集資組成一會。曰瞎了會。在四月間出賽。是日衆瞎子休業一日。僱得一般乞丐。張布旗。擎敝傘。抬破亭。敲啞鑼。幾名鼓吹手。吹圓了紅頸子。格格不能入調。歪抬着小泥菩薩。上街亂撞。並有瞎子喝道。衆瞎子衣冠齋整。得意洋洋。扶瞎子瞎孫。向前疾走。有手搖摺扇。大搖大擺。假充斯文者。有眼已靑盲。尙掉首瞎顧。自以爲雄者。有持竿亂戳。瞎衝瞎撞。莫辨東西者。奇形怪狀。觀者無不發噱。賽罷歸來。備有公份之酒席。狼呑虎嚥。醜態畢露。以上種種。非拙筆所能形容也。無線電中聆法曲　·鏡·原 　　疇昔之夕。天眞兒童娱樂社。應中國播音協會之請。假上海江西路亞美公司播音台	播秦該社所編之各種兒童叢曲。如「月亮亮。」「小蝴蝶慢慢飛」「「張老老的莊子」等。鄙人預向亞美公司代售處購就曲本。故播送時得以按譜聽曲。津津有	味。按編制歌曲。往往失之俚俗。或偏於枯窘。「月亮亮」等曲音調堂皇。詞意亦純潔。適合一般兒童之心理。惜是日因限於時間。未獲將該社叢曲悉數播奏。以餉無線電聽衆。斯爲憾事耳。攝影展覧會追記　　王梅璩·　　前星期日。夢魚約赴華安公司八樓參觀全國第三届攝影展覧比賽聨合大會。是日炎熇。有如中伏。而電梯扶搖。層樓高聳。清風徐來。暑威頓减。产待詳瞻出品。已覺世界清凉矣。况琳瑯滿目。勝友如雲。是安可以不記。爰分書之。　　會址之得地　華安公司位於滬市適中地點。八樓聳秀。上出重霄。攝影會占地五開間。縱橫曲折、頗具匠心。布佈置之富麗。光線之充足。尤可助展覧之逸興。謂爲得地。誰曰不宜。　　到會之人物是日除會中人列席外。各界士女。經大會特約加入展覧者。概不收費。女賓參觀者亦多。尤以滬江復旦兩大學爲盛。座中裙屐與壁上之倩影。兩耀成彩。洵奇觀也。鄙人何幸。乃得　於其間。　　招待之肫摰入會展覧時。由林澤蒼陳傅霖兩君殷勤招待。欵以茶點水飲。備述攝影藝術上研究之經過。苦心孤詣。所以成此偉業。非偶然也。　　作品之美備出品森列。隨日光而閃耀。如入山陰道上。使人應接不睱。蓋陳列至二百十片之多。皆非凡品。其中如沈炎君之雪舟。吳中行君之春雪痕。林澤民君之明眸倩影。林澤蒼君之木魚磬聲歸棹徐進。符惱武君之浣與健。趙澄君之河邊散牧。聶光地之朝吻與兩個時代。皆爲傑作。而陳傅霖君所攝之粒粒辛苦。人事無常。傅神阿堵。尤可注目。其階之一角一片。章法又復特别。可佩也。容齋讀畫　　　　　　柯定　　　余以衣食作牛馬之奔走。竟無片刻睱晷。舍機械生活而外。祇睡眠以事調節。日前抽睱。驅車至畏友馬孟容君處。時孟容方作扇頭畫。起立相迓。傾談至快。余請繼續作畫。孟容從之。所作爲菊。展瓣目如。設色靈活。君於畫菊具有特長。矯正前人之謬誤。發揮一已之心得。能於風睛雨露。表現菊之神熊。因時而異。斯難能而可貴也。客歳曾見一菊花立軸。題曰。菊爲重陽冒雨開。雨裏秋容。别饒風味。設非神手。安能寫此。今所見者。悉爲扇箑。菊花居多。配以小鳥或蟲豸。形神逼肖。驅之欲飛。余最愛桃花枝上一翠鳥、作伸喙欲啄小蟲狀、仿彿處身春日園林矣。（此箑已爲他定去）孟容見余愛不忍釋。即以無欵者令擇、余乃取其水墨海棠及鶴舞雲霄各一。道謝曰。承君厚貺。將何以爲報耶。孟容曰。畫贈知己。雖佳弗吝。况余作未臻化境。恐不能當一盼也。孟容謙遜逾人。於此益見。余懐中適有友人李祖韓贈扇。並未寫過。出以求書、孟容即爲揮毫。雲烟騰越。俄頃而成。書法秀逸瀟灑。一如其人。誠表現個性之傑作也、聞暑假期中。將设國畫補習班。造就後起。爲功匪淺。行見清麗動人。莊嚴絶俗之畫派。爲中國藝林特創一新格矣。公愚爲孟容介弟。工書法。無所不精。間喜作畫。亦頗可觀。尤善金石。超各派而上。别具作風。余與公愚久不晤矣。想日來揮毫潑墨。其樂靡永。記餘述此。蓋誌念也。南洋遊記　　　（四五）　　　　　　　　麗花·　　花有多種。熱帶之花多不香。四時皆開之故耳。然亦有香者。途中見在樹。或曰鐵樹也。余又不能定其名。紅槐之花。到處鮮艶至海濱。有榕樹園。樹大可遮數百人。黑人多盡　其下。老幼男女小兒。均依其蔭凉。有鼾臥者。有相戲者。有賣零食者。以此樹爲慈母矣。榕樹聞南美不少。有榕樹新村。余曾見其畫。福建亦有之。兩廣瓊州最多乃近熱帶之樹至長江則無也。其樹極壽。可數百年。桂林有千年之榕。云死若干年而復生。人以爲神而祀之。按莊子楚人。屢説南方動植蟲類異聞。蓋老莊皆深觀自然學者。故曰　櫟其樹大而無用。不可以爲材。故壽命長久也。但榕樹無他用。惟遮凉最宜。故兩廣每村有之。今馬來人每午間一睡其下。殆即彼之樂園耳。余觀於彼之榕樹午眠。回想舊約所言人祖之樂園。而歎今日物質之桎梏。所以託爾士太辈高唱取消物質中心之夢也。　　十六日與友人論及南洋之黃金問題、與中國前途大有關係。吾以爲當今國内金荒時代。應設法將南洋之金輸入祖國。南洋之金甚多。而婦女首飾之用尤夥。其首飾與中土異簪則成行。耳環極大。聞土人有成斤者。或誤傅耳。不但首飾手飾。且有足飾足帶金鐐以爲美實乃古制。男女掠女加以手扭足鐐之遺傳。而變爲金銀器也。土人之足趾及鼻。均穿以金。即華女之胸。亦金飾纍纍。有一身而値十餘萬者。在陰七月。各埠均有鬥寳之俗。在廟内擧行。各富家均往。其貴者則用鑽石而不用金矣。聞女人所積金更多。有埋於土中者。非至大病垂危。不告其親人。急症不暇説。以此失去金者亦不少也。要之將來中國欲改金鎊。非取給南洋之金不可、此亦不難。即國内統一無戰事。人自樂還鄉耳。今日銀賤金貴。人亦多滙歸國内。以圖發展雖然。如何使國内太平乎。此問題誠未易解决耳。心上温馨（二）（二）（八）　　　　　包天笑　　第十二回　别宴離筵拈花留倩影　　名園嘉會鬭茗覩芳姿　　那位味蒓園主人。却是上海一位著名的交際家。。他也認得上海的許多人。。上		海的許多人。。常到張園去逛逛的。。也大半都認譏他。他雖是個壞了的道台出身。。有了幾個錢。。也不想再去刮地皮了。。還是在上海自己花園裏。。做一個高等茶房。。來得寫意。。而且他不拿身分。。不搭架子。。上自海上庽公的什麽某宫保某宫保。。和上海最紅的出息最多的海關道等。。下至戲子馬夫。。他都能和他們話得投機。。這回爲了慈善救濟會的事。。要借他的地方。。自然先得和他商量。。他聽得説是有這様的盛會。。早已满口答應。。他説除了搭天篷蓆棚以及裝電燈的種種佈置之外。。所有地方。。他完全可以借給你們。。旣然大家爲了救濟災民的一點慈善起見。。我自然也得盡一份子義務。。他們見他伉爽。。也就請他做了一個發起人兼幹事。。這幾個發起人兼幹事。。便把該會的名稱和章程先擬起來。。有人説。。那慈善救濟會的名目太大了。。我們果然爲了救濟災民而設。。但這一次開會的結果。。不知可以籌得到多少錢。。或許所得甚微。。除去開銷以外。。不過幾千塊銀。。甚而至於不到幾千塊錢。。未免有些大話小結果。。似乎用這個慈善救濟的名稱。。未免太浮誇了。。我們這一回子。。只可以算閙着玩的。。那算是中國的破天荒。。中國没有開過這種會。。拿來試騐一下子的。。所以要另外想一個名兒。。因此有許多人。。提出了許多名兒。。又有人説。。我們在上海租界裏。。辦這個會。。把外國人的太太小姐們招致在内。。自然愈見有勢力。。同時又添了不少興趣。。而且所招致的人。。不拘一國。。英國法國美國日本人都有。。我們最好稱這個會爲萬國什麽會。。自然覺得富麗堂皇了。。那也有人駁他道。。剛纔某先生覺得慈美救濟之名也不居。。現在又用到萬國兩字。。未免範圍太大了。。那位先生道。。不然。。上海地方。。只要有幾個外國人在内預聞某事。。便可以稱之爲萬國。。譬如出一部關於各國的書。。便可以稱之爲萬國什麽。。如萬國地理萬國公法之類。。各國人出來組織的圑體。。也用這萬國兩字。。好比萬國商圑。。萬國體育之類。。説到了萬國。。豈是眞正有一萬個國在裏頭。。不過表明這是各國都贊成意思。。我們現在這個會。。旣然有外國人在裏頭。。怎麽可以稱萬國呢。。</p>

<p>到庭旁聽者五百餘人</p>
<p>舞女四十餘倦眼惺忪</p>
<p>童三毛供詞極爲滑稽</p>
<p>舞女黃白英、被逼服毒以來、屈指計之、已九日矣、此九日之中、滬人之關懷此案者莫不延頸佇望其結局究竟如何尤以跳舞塲中所談者、不出童白範圍、蓋舞女心中、有人人自危之念、而舞客心中、則人人有一白英在也、昨日爲二次續審之期、觀審者多至五百餘人、千餘隻眼睛、盡集於此可憐女子之身、因之毎一發吻、四座傾耳、當其自述至孤苦伶仃、孑然一身、願爲他人犧牲時、不覺悲從中來、淚汨汨下、全場聽者、爲之黯然、而童三毛則聳立被告欄中、侷促不安、法官詢以數語</p>

<p>童三毛衣白嗶嘰西裝、鬆其襯衫之領、未加領帶、凹面突額、隻目内陷、言時極不自然高立被告欄中、頗爲人所注意、聽衆中頗有揶揄譏笑之者、尤以推事問供事、因答「她搶吃藥片不叫我吃」及「恐她不吃故我一定要她吃的」數語、聞者爲之嘩笑、而黃白英則满面怨嗔、時露不屑之態、</p>

<p>吳推事旋點傅黃白英、黃即遵諭立於證欄、操極流之國語、供稱十九歲、廣東人、滬寓法租界吕班路萬宜坊、在靜安寺路巴黎舞塲爲舞女、已歴年餘、去年七八月間在大東跳舞場始與被告童三毛相識、吳推事遂將黃白英於六月三十日在寳隆醫院所供之筆録擲與之閲、並訊以所記相符否、筆録之末所書「黃白英二十九」等字、是否親筆、黃審視良久、乃稱、其時因服毒後</p>
<p>神志昏迷　此字是否我簽、則難記憶、至筆録内所記亦有不盡然處、吳推事因諭將此案經過詳述、黃稱上月二十九午夜、童到巴黎跳舞旣畢、由方衡年先生邀童及我同出、乘汽車納凉、因方知童將與我爲難　擬乘機排解、詎登車後、童忽與方曰、「一星期後你看吧」、時車往西開駛、方與童在車中所語、我未注意、故不悉其言、嗣駛至北新涇車停、童方兩人共同下車立談、有頃、復共登車駛回、斯時童在車内、向我言「余已費銀數十兩購得</p>
<p>手槍一支將用以擊汝」、言時、隨從身畔取一銀行存摺、示我支欵數目與時日、我此際驚懼萬分、適童將坐墊移動、我疑其有異與、即詰之、童竟</p>
<p>摑我之頰一下、迨車抵梅白克路、方先生别我等下車、臨别聞方謂童曰、「你旣與我爲友、但切勿與黃爲難」、言已掉首去、童遂囑車夫將汽車向吳淞進發、童於車内詢我願嫁渠否、我因畏懼、故頻頻搖首童又詢我「可以不可以」、我毅然答曰「不可以」、及車駛至吳淞江畔、童命御者下車、旋操語嚇我曰、「此處乃你死所、你若不於此際死、則將來或須死兩人、更須死三人」、黃白英述至此、頓覺心酸淚落、然仍嗚咽而繼續訴稱、我之父母早歲雙亡、「我乃一孤苦弱女子、是時聞童之言、我</p>

<p>The Naval Shipbuilding of Various Countries After the London Conference</p>
<p>The London Naval Conference was a conference aimed at reducing naval armaments. However, the Five-Power Conference unfortunately resulted in an agreement only among Great Britain, the United States, and Japan. France and Italy failed to achieve any results due to disputes over tonnage, which was not the initial intention. Moreover, this has caused a major rift between France and Italy, and its future is highly imaginable. Subsequently, the countries that agreed have either changed their shipbuilding programs based on the agreement or have further planned new national defense plans due to the agreement. Although there is the appearance of reducing armaments, they still constantly remember to strengthen their combat power, which is very inconsistent with the initial intention of reducing armaments. As for the countries outside the five naval powers, countries that are not usually known for their naval efforts are now also eager to try. According to foreign telegrams received today, Portugal's shipbuilding program is currently being compiled, with a budget of 60 million US dollars and a duration of eight years, to build two cruisers, twelve destroyers, twelve submarines, one aircraft carrier, and two gunboats. According to a communication from Riga, Soviet Russia has been continuously and rapidly engaging in armament since sending two battleships to the Black Sea in May, with the aim of restoring its hegemony in the Baltic Sea. The newly built 26,000-ton dreadnought "Frunze" has recently been completed, and the construction of four 900-ton submarines has begun. Its naval power includes three 26,000-ton dreadnoughts, one cruiser, thirty-two destroyers, and ten submarines, and its combat power actually exceeds the total of the warships of various countries in the Baltic Sea. Therefore, the competition for naval armaments among countries in the future is only just beginning.</p>

The National Government is quite clear about the nature of the diplomatic corps.

<p>The first is the United States, which cannot help but feel a bit jealous towards the entire European alliance. The US Senate has always adopted a non-cooperative attitude towards European diplomacy. The United States has never joined the League of Nations. At the last London conference, France tried its best to propose a Mediterranean security guarantee treaty, but it was suspended due to opposition from the United States. Although the current European Union organization seems to have nothing to do with the United States on the surface, it is very clear that it is a kind of organization to confront the United States in terms of economic and political significance. Therefore, most American newspapers have been ridiculing the European Union plan. In the past nine years, due to the expansion of industrial production in various countries and the large number of unemployed, the two continents of Europe and the United States have used tariff policies to exclude each other. Yesterday (June 13), the US Senate passed a new tariff bill, which greatly increased the tax rate on European goods entering the country. European exporting countries have also successively found ways to deal with it. Under such circumstances, if the European Federation becomes a reality, the situation of confrontation between capitalism on the two continents of Europe and the United States will become even more tense. The European Union movement, which is marked by peace as its purpose, may in fact be enough to provoke war, which is uncertain. This is the biggest worry of ordinary people about the future of the entire European alliance.</p>

<h3 id="e51">(Eight) The Anti-Russian United Front <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Briand's European Union plan limits the countries that can join to those that are members of the League of Nations. The Soviet Union has not joined the League of Nations, so it is difficult to occupy a vast territory in Europe, but it is excluded from the entire European alliance. In the eyes of the Soviet government, whether Briand did it intentionally or unintentionally, the European Union movement was entirely launched to oppose Russia. In other words, the European capitalist countries should build an anti-Russian united front to extinguish communism. Therefore, the Soviet Union naturally expressed opposition to this plan. In addition to propaganda, the method of opposition is to secretly undermine it, and win over some European countries to prevent the European Union from being realized. According to recent news, the governments of Russia and Germany will convene a meeting in Moscow in the middle of this month. The superficial purpose is to resolve the outstanding issues between Russia and Germany, but in fact it is to enhance Russian-German friendship, so that Germany will not join the anti-Russian front. It is said that in Germany's reply to Briand's plan, it will explain the importance of Russia's position, and that if Russia does not join the alliance, there will be many difficulties. To be fair, Russia occupies nearly half of the total area of ​​Europe. If the entire European alliance does not include Russia, it will of course be difficult to succeed. If Russia is allowed to join, it is practically impossible. This is also a major difficulty for the future of the European Union.</p>
<h3 id="e52">(Nine) Will Britain Join the European Union? <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Looking at the inside of the alliance, there are still many problems. The first is Britain. Briand's plan of course hopes that Britain will join, but although Britain's own territory is in Europe, it is ultimately a world empire. Its autonomous territories and colonies are widely distributed all over the world, and its nature is completely different from that of other European countries. In other words, Britain's main interests lie in the British ruins and colonies widely distributed in Asia, Africa, America, and Australia, and not entirely in Europe. Whether Britain's joining the European Union is beneficial to its own country, and whether it will not arouse the resentment of its overseas territories, is a question. Britain has always adopted a so-called "glorious isolation" policy towards the European continent, that is, it is unwilling to insert itself into the middle of continental politics. After the war, Britain joined the League of Nations and joined the Locarno Agreement, and the isolation policy has gradually been abandoned. However, abandoning its own scattered overseas territories and devoting itself to the European Union is not allowed by most British opinions. Recently, in order to save the decline of industry and the panic of unemployment, Britain is working hard to seek economic ties between various territories and colonies within the British Empire. Therefore, it will not be very enthusiastic about the European Union. Conservative and Labour newspapers, although superficially praising Briand's plan, say that it is difficult to realize, which shows its cold attitude. Only the Liberal Party welcomes it to a considerable extent because the European Union may promote free trade between European countries, at least reduce European tax barriers, and benefit British industry. In the current situation, even if the entire European Union is established, whether Britain can join is a big question.</p>
<h3 id="e53">(Ten) The Hegemonic Struggle Between France and Italy <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>But the biggest difficulty within the entire European Union is Italy's attitude. When Briand's plan was sent to the governments of various countries, it was the day when Mussolini delivered an important political speech in Florence. This extremely absurd speech by the Fascist leader aroused quite a stir in European opinion circles, because the speech was completely challenging. Since the London Conference, the relationship between France and Italy has become increasingly bad. Italy wants to dominate the Mediterranean and the Balkans, and it cannot but conflict with French interests. Since the European Union was initiated by the French side, in Italy's view, it is entirely an attempt by France to monopolize continental hegemony, which is no different from Metternich's Holy Alliance and Bismarck's Three Emperors Alliance. Therefore, Italian newspapers not only did not praise Briand's plan, but also expressed great suspicion. If the conflict between France and Italy cannot be resolved, we can believe that the entire European Union will never be established.</p>
<h3 id="e54">(Eleven) Germany's Attitude <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>In addition to Britain, France, and Italy, the most important country in the European Union is of course Germany. Germany generally agrees with Briand's plan, but in general, Germany requires amending the humiliating terms in the Treaty of Versailles before it can join the European Union, because otherwise, Germany cannot stand on an equal footing with the other allied countries. However, if the treaty is affected by the entire European Union, it will not be allowed by France. Originally, France launched the entire European Union directly to seek the stability of the European continent, and indirectly to consolidate the victory it gained in the war. On the contrary, Germany is quite thinking of using this opportunity to increase its international status. On this point, France and Germany will not fail to quarrel. In addition, Germany is also worried that the European Union will become a tool of French continental imperialism, especially if Britain does not join the European Union, Germany's position in the European Union will be completely isolated, and it will inevitably be controlled by France. Therefore, Germany's attitude is also very noteworthy.</p>
<h3 id="e55">(Twelve) Our Reflection <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Whether the entire European Union can become a reality, or to what extent this large-scale federal organization can be realized, is too early to speculate at present. However, it cannot be denied that the European Union plan will become a powerful movement in international politics in the near future. Originally, under the current situation of mutual plundering and competition in modern political economy, it is difficult for a country to survive if it is not unified and strong internally. Even if it is unified and strong internally, it will still be unable to stand if it is not united externally and has no assistance. Therefore, modern countries have formed many groups on the basis of common interests. The British Empire and its vast overseas territories and colonies are a group. The Pan-American Alliance formed by the United States of America and the various republics of Central and South America is another group. The Soviet Union, formed by the seven Soviet republics of Europe and Asia, is also a group. Now, if this entire European Union becomes a reality, a new national group will be produced. In this way, the countries and nations of the world are almost all united within the scope of regional or political organizations, defending the interests of the group internally and plundering from countries outside the group. Now, only the countries of East Asia, the weak and small nations in the colonies and semi-colonies, are still like scattered sand and cannot unite. Therefore, Briand's document is quite enough to arouse our endless reflection (sent from Paris on June 14)</p>

<h3 id="e57">Memorial Week of the Central Government and the National Government <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<h3 id="e58">Central Party Headquarters The Central Party Headquarters held the 67th Memorial Week of the Prime Minister in the auditorium at 9:00 am on the 7th. Central Committee members Sun Ke, Chen Guofu, Liu Luyin, Chen Lifu, Ke Xinge, Miao Peicheng, etc., staff of various ministries and commissions, and guests, totaling about five or six hundred people, attended. Sun Ke chaired the meeting. After the ceremony, Liu Luyin reported, saying that since the Third Plenary Session decided to promote the literature of the Three Principles of the People, so that the general young comrades can make concrete expressions of their feelings and thoughts in academics, over the past few months, the Party has conducted in-depth research, and Commissioner Hu Hanmin, based on this term, proposed an implementation plan, and Commissioner Ye Chuqi also wrote a paper to express his opinions. This seat believes that the purpose of promoting this kind of literature is to be able to represent the Chinese nation, promote superior culture, have special essence in world literature, make people envy and admire, and be able to adapt to all the requirements of society and the nation, and achieve their unified wishes. In particular, this kind of literature takes the Three Principles of the People as the main standpoint, and the method of implementation is that the Party comrades can integrate and understand it. If it is considered to be created by a faction, or regarded as a stereotyped article, then the understanding is greatly mistaken. If you have this view, it is the observation of those who stand outside this kind of literature and make criticisms, not the position of those who are in the works. This point must be clearly understood before it can be easily promoted. Some people think that this is a new creation in the literary world, and they are quite worried that materials are not easy to find. However, the so-called Three Principles of the People must summarize all political, economic, and social systems and processes into literature, and all construction undertakings are conceived in literature. It is not a separate banner. All internal affairs, foreign insults, and what you see and hear, the phenomena and facts between the country and the people, between China and other countries, how to improve, and how to innovate are all great materials in literature, and there is no difficulty. Moreover, China has a vast land and abundant resources. At any time, any place, any matter, and any thing all contain literary significance and coincide with the Three Principles of the People. If you seek it, you will get it, and you will not worry about it. Therefore, the Party comrades should take this literature as the central force, earnestly shoulder the work, in order to quickly succeed the Three Principles of the People and last forever. The proletarian theory advocated by the Communist Party is translated as bankruptcy theory. Its propaganda power is only equivalent to spreading leaflets, and it will disappear in a blink of an eye. If the literature of the Three Principles of the People is once promoted at home and abroad, then all heresies will be defeated without attack. After the report, the meeting adjourned at half past ten. <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<h3 id="e59">National Government At 10:00 am on the same day, the National Government held the Prime Minister's Memorial Week. Tan Yankai, Gu Yingfen, Ma Fuxiang, Jiang Menglin, Yi Peiji, Wang Zhengting, Liu Ruiheng, Zhang Nanxian, Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Zhou Yawei, Zhang Wohua, Chen Yu, Zhu Jingnong, and more than 200 staff members from the two departments of the National Government attended. Tan Yankai chaired the meeting. After the ceremony, Secretary Qian Changzhao reported that the military aspects, Longhai and Pinghan lines, were very victorious, and Shi Yousan's troops were almost completely wiped out. Feng Yuxiang's troops were wiped out by three-quarters, and Kaifeng and Zhengzhou could be taken down within days. Our defensive affairs on the Jinpu Road were very solid and there was nothing to worry about. Zhang Guitai's remnant bandits in Hunan were being surrounded and suppressed by us, suffering heavy losses and not difficult to clear. Generally speaking, the military will soon be concluded. After the report, the meeting adjourned. <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>

<h3 id="e62">Shi's Army in Western Shandong Has Been Defeated A correspondent from Xuzhou reported that the Jin army on the Jinpu Line that is now crossing the river south is said to be five armies, two divisions per army, and three regiments per division. Feng Pengzhu's troops are left to defend Jinan, and Fu Zuoyi's troops are going south along the line. Another part is deployed on the Jiaoji Line to prevent the eastward retreat of Han Jun's troops. According to the news from the Fifteenth Route Army, He Yaozu is currently traveling between Zou County and Yanzhou to command military affairs. He was ordered to command the Jinpu Road armies and sent a telegram to politely decline, but Chiang Kai-shek replied that the Jinpu military affairs were very important and urged He to supervise the army to advance to the Qufu area immediately. At present, although it is a local contact, the battle is quite fierce. Kong Decheng, a descendant of Confucius, and others sent a joint telegram to Jin Yan asking them not to fight in Qufu, saying, "Respectfully present to Commander Yan, in the past two days, battles have occurred near the Qufu Sacred Forest, and shells and bullets have fallen into the forest, the ground is approaching, and the temple is also shocked and extremely dangerous. It is found that Jerusalem is the Christian holy land in Europe, and in the past European wars, it was drawn 30 miles away, and all countries have recognized Confucius as the source of Chinese culture, and Qufu is the location of Confucius' forest temple. Your Excellency respects Confucianism and values morality, and has special enthusiasm. We hope that you will follow the example of Europe and draw Qufu out of the battle line and grant it protection. We are extremely frightened and eagerly await orders." Qufu Kong Decheng led the Kong clan and all members of the Qufu Confucian Association to kowtow. News from the front of Longhai stated that Shi Yousan's troops in the direction of Kaocheng north of the line launched an offensive against the right wing of the Central Army on the first day, attacking western Shandong in an attempt to establish contact with the Jin army on the Jinpu Line. On the second day, they occupied the line of the old Kaocheng. They were surrounded by the Central Army. Another part of Shi's troops attacked Cao County and was also pursued by the Central Army. The two sides fought fiercely. Shi's army was unable to support them, and by the fourth day, they had completely collapsed. According to the military, Shi's troops were the main force of the enemy on the right wing of Longhai. Shi has been severely damaged, and should have no ability to attack. <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>

<h3 id="e67">Recent Situation of Political Parties in Jinan A correspondent from Qingdao reported that a reporter asked about the local situation from someone who came from Jinan. According to him, since the Jin army entered Jinan, and the various administrative organs moved to Dezhou, the military, political, and party affairs in Shandong have been in a state of chaos. The Civil Affairs and Finance Departments are in extreme difficulty due to the initial relocation to Jinan. Many things are difficult to handle. Wang Yijing, the director of the Public Security Bureau, in order to maintain the lives of the police, asked the Finance Department yesterday to first receive hundreds of yuan in expenses to cope with the current situation, which was also impossible. Other things can be imagined. Except for the heads of the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments, the main personnel of other bureaus and offices are all of a temporary nature. However, due to the complexity of the situation, some were appointed by Shi Yousan, some by the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments, and some by the various military chiefs. Often, several people were appointed by one organ at the same time. Whoever has great power and strength can take office. Otherwise, the announcement is equivalent to being invalid. Therefore, the personnel of various organs are replaced every few days, every five days, or even someone who takes office for one day and is taken away by others. As a result, many disputes have occurred invisibly. Taking the magistrate of Licheng County as an example, he has been replaced four times in a few days. As for party affairs, since the former provincial and municipal party departments left Jinan, all party affairs personnel who had been out of favor and had been wanted in the past have come out to move around. Leng Gangfeng, a member of the former provincial party department, and Yin Juncai, a member of the municipal party department, and others have arrived in Jinan one after another. A certain member of the municipal party department who had not yet left Jinan was discovered by more than a dozen party members yesterday, tied up, and taken away. There are also many others who have been arrested. The party members who were detained in the Public Security Bureau and the court have been completely restored to their freedom. However, due to the lack of funds, the voice of poverty is endless. Requests are not implemented by the administrative organs, and having a party is equivalent to not having a party. As for the military affairs along the Jiaoji Road, there are no special changes. Han Fuju's brigade is still in the Zibo Weixian Qingzhou area, planning to attack back. Liu Zhennian's army is between Changi and Yexian. The third and fourth passenger trains between Jiaoji Road and Qingdao have been restored today (July 2). <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<h3 id="e68">Han Fuju Suppressed the Bandit Army in Jiaoxian A correspondent from Qingdao reported that the bandits in the southern part of Jiaoxian County were originally divided into three major groups. The bandit leaders were Sun Baoshan, Wang Shun, and Li Xiaoqi. This time, they were recruited by Han Fuju and appointed Ji Xiaoxi as the commander of the guerrillas. The headquarters was moved to Jiaoxian City. At first, they were at peace with each other, but then the bandit nature relapsed and illegal incidents occurred from time to time. Han received a report and urgently ordered Ji Xiaoxi, the commander of the bandit army, to go to Wei and scold him. Ji was afraid and did not dare to go. Han then detained a certain person who was appointed by Ji as the office staff stationed in Wei, and on the 30th of last month, sent a company of troops from Gaomi to Jiaoxian to inspect. The bandit army heard that Han's troops had arrived and left the city temporarily to avoid them. They found out that Han's troops had returned to Gaomi, and entered the city again that night. First, they released all the prisoners in the prison, and the official treasury was also destroyed. That night, the bandits acted freely and looted at will. The most heavily robbed areas were in the southwest gate area, including more than a dozen shops such as Fulai, Yongli He, Zenghe Shun, Renhe, Yu Ye Company, and Deyuan, which were all looted. Magistrate Qi Qingchi heard the news and jumped off the city wall in a hurry, and took the Jiaolu car to Qingdao to take refuge. It is said that Qi broke his arm when he jumped off the city wall and is currently being treated in a certain hospital. After the magistrate fled, the personnel of various organs were also scattered, and no one presided over the county administration. The bandit army then appointed Zhao Shengshan, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, to temporarily preside over the county administration, and sent four bandits to monitor him. They also extorted 300,000 yuan from the gentry and merchants in the suburbs of the city, and have now collected 100,000 yuan. The remaining 200,000 yuan is due to be delivered within a time limit. After the bandit army rebelled, they changed their armbands. Each bandit had a red cloth wrapped around his sleeve, with the word "Ji" written on it. They were also afraid of Han's troops suppressing them, so they closed all the city gates tightly and sent bandits to guard them. Civilians were not allowed to enter or leave the city. The other day, two villagers sneaked out of the water cave, and were seen by the bandits and shot to death on the spot. The actual number of bandits is only more than 600, plus the newly recruited prisoners and bandits, about nearly 1,000. The bandit headquarters is located in the Ceng Mansion in Chenghuangmiao Street, Xiguan. The bandits are stationed in various key points in the suburbs of the city. The nearby people have come to Qingdao to take refuge. The villages are uniting the people's groups and attacking together. Han's army has also sent troops to suppress them. It is expected that these clowns will be wiped out in one fell swoop (July 2). <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<h3 id="e69">Deng's Army Defeated the Communist Bandits in Ji'an A correspondent from Nanchang reported on the 3rd that Ji'an is an important town in western Jiangxi. The Communist bandits have long thought of occupying it, so when Cheng's brigade was stationed in Ji'an, it was heavily guarded. After Deng Ying's army was transferred to Ji'an, in addition to stationing its troops in Sanqu Tan, Qujiang, and Gujiang, it also ordered the Minzu and Minquan ships to be equipped with machine guns and cannons to patrol the Ganjiang River to maintain traffic. Recently, the Communist bandits' Zeng Bingchun and Luo Binghui's troops in western Jiangxi divided into five routes to besiege Ji'an, attacking the city several times, which was extremely fierce. Fortunately, Deng's army met the enemy in separate ways and killed many bandits. The bandits were defeated and Ji'an City turned from danger to safety. Yesterday, Deng had telegraphed to report everything, and requested to send several cannons to bombard the remnant bandits. Chairman Lu had telegraphed his approval and ordered a commendation. <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<h3 id="e70">Telegraph from Aviation on the 6th The Communist bandits Huang Gonglue, Luo Binghui, etc. in Ji'an, and the bandit leaders Li Jiaochen, Li Zaiyang, Zhang Mingguang, Zhou Yingzu, etc. in Jishui, occupied various counties and disturbed them from time to time. The provincial government has ordered all counties to cooperate with Deng's army to suppress them. On the one hand, in addition to telegraphed to transfer the Xiang armies back to Jiangxi, they also telegraphed to Nanjing Chief of Staff Zhu, requesting to allocate one or two airplanes to Jiangxi for joint suppression. <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<h3 id="e71">Huludao Inauguration Ceremony (Continued) Huludao Port Construction and construction has been carried out three times. The first time was somewhat successful, but we can only sigh regretfully that it was abandoned. The second time it was built, but not built, far inferior to the last time. Now it is the third time. Before this plan, the central and local authorities had consulted many times. The Datong branch line of this road was completed, and the central government repeatedly sent people to investigate. However, due to various financial reasons, there was no definite solution. In the past year, due to the rapid increase in the surplus of this road, the central government urged and finally decided to build the project in a concrete plan. The preparations have been announced long ago and need not be detailed. Since this road and the Dutch company signed the contract, it has gone through the procedures of submitting for review and approval. At the same time, all transportation and construction materials were prepared and transported, so it was delayed for another six months. Today, the construction ceremony can be officially held. The matter that has been shelved for more than 20 years has been successfully prepared in six months. Although it cannot be said to be very fast, it has finally achieved its goal. Many people say that the reason for building the port is to compete with the Grand Canal for profits, to serve as a base for the Northeast Navy or commerce, and to serve as an external government for the wealth of the Northeast. All of these are wrong. China is a country with many products on the ground. It should bear the great responsibility of material supply in this economic world. This time, the construction of the port is only one ten-thousandth of the great responsibility of China. It really holds the grand ambition of universal domination and takes the world economy as its foothold. It is by no means limited by shallow politics and the temporary relationship between one or two countries. Huludao has indeed been a battlefield, but it is applicable to the era of swords and guns in the Yuan and Ming dynasties, and not to modern military affairs. As for the commercial item, it can only be said to be a commercial liaison place, not a commercial base. Adding the word Northeast to the base is especially inappropriate, because Huludao is planned and built by the Chinese state, and is not privately owned by the Northeast. The local part of the Northeast can hardly be restricted. The opening of the island is a national economic undertaking, and it is by no means a state-owned company or factory in the Northeast. The surplus profits of the port are hopeless in decades. Even if there are surplus profits, they belong to the state-owned and state-owned. The Northeast cannot luckily obtain the port surplus. Moreover, Director Zhang is very concerned about the interests of the country and the people. Taking the Beining Road as an example, he has also used various good intentions to protect it, so that this surplus item can be used to carry out the construction of the port. There are four reasons for building the port: 1. Heaven gives it and people take it; 2. It is a platform for international exchange; 3. It is a pioneer of our country's construction; 4. The convenience of transportation is realized by the sea and land belts. The reasons for building the port are as mentioned above, and there are still four questions that need to be clarified. First, it is difficult for the port affairs to be completed successfully. Even if it does not give up halfway, the international community will interfere and stop it. This question has no reason, because foreign countries cannot interfere in China's affairs, just as China cannot <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Page 8</p>
<p>Interfere in the affairs of foreign countries, not to mention seeking common interests for mankind. Second, the reason why the port construction is operated solely by Beining Road is that this road can have a surplus for construction, and the director's order is like this, and it cannot be rejected. Third, the construction funds have been carefully considered, not only the fixed expenses, but also the special funds are allocated on a monthly basis, and there is no need to worry about lack of funds, even the gold price will soar, and other unexpected expenses have also been calculated in advance, with ample surplus. Fourth, the reason why the Dutch company must undertake the port construction is because the Dutch people are purely aquatic, and they are also famous for their construction. Their engineering must be precise and solid. As for the port construction contract that has been signed, it is purely commercial in nature and has no other effect. In short, the port construction plan strives to be complete and secret. The important parts of the plan are the scientific construction of the port, the economic organization of the port affairs, the civilian facilities of the port administration, and the internationalization of commercial operations. Other plans, such as land road connections, vehicle allocation, and navigation regulations, may be a long way off, or they may be generally irrelevant, so there is no need to describe them in detail. According to our plan, we dare not say that the future hope can be compared with the three major ports among the world's top ten ports, as well as Dalian Bay and Vladivostok. However, if we can achieve the position of sea and land belt, then this small seaport can make the Northeast traffic have a rapid progress, the situation in North China has a brand-new situation, and the Chinese society, traffic, and the masses will also have a strong and powerful impression. However, the complete success of all matters will eventually require the joint assistance of the environment. The government should be asked to persist to the end, and not to interrupt it due to political influence. Secondly, the advanced countries should be asked to give detailed instructions on the experience and plans of port management with a friendly attitude, and please the nationals and Chinese and foreign opinion circles to give as much publicity and criticism as possible within a considerable scope, so as to achieve the goal of recording everything that is heard, evaluating everything that is recorded, and saying everything that is known without reservation. Then I am willing to listen to it with pleasure, and the colleagues of this port also know that they must correct their mistakes. Secondly, the Dutch port management company should be asked to be extra faithful to the work of this port and fulfill the contract, so that the company can also get a good reputation in the future due to the solidity of the construction project of this port. Finally, I hope that the colleagues of this port will be diligent, progressive, incorruptible, and cautious in serving the public. To achieve the complete success of this port, we must work together. And I hope that today's officials, representatives, and Chinese and foreign guests will give good instructions, so that we can follow them.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Speech Summary <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>1.  Zhang Xueliang's speech roughly stated, "No matter what kind of project is built, although there is no expression at the time, it will be used in the future. If there were no engineer Hughes to construct the surface building where the auditorium is today, the foundation would not be laid today. The same is true for all people doing things. I, myself, will give Director Gao full authority to build this port, so that it will be successful."</p>
<p>2.  Wu Tiecheng's speech roughly stated, "Since the Opium War, the power of foreigners has grown, and the engineering undertakings of our country have been manipulated by two or three foreigners. How painful! Today's port construction is a sign that our Chinese people are rising up to engage in trade directly with foreign countries and make friends directly with foreigners. However, since the establishment of the National Government, internal unrest has not ceased. This is the fatal injury to construction. If the people cooperate with each other and put down the internal unrest, then the future of port construction will have even greater benefits."</p>
<p>3.  Cui Tingxian's speech roughly stated that he was also one of the members during the first port construction, so he came to participate in the inauguration ceremony today. Comparing the previous process with today, it is expected that the new atmosphere of today can be used to celebrate the opening and the success of the construction. The next day, the consul read the congratulatory message, and then the Russian consul gave a speech, and the Russian vice-consul translated the Chinese language (omitted).</p>
<h3 id="e73">Project Status <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The entire island construction is divided into three areas, namely the southeastern area is the commercial area, the southern area is the industrial area, and the northwestern area is the residential area. A total of seven wharves are built, and it is stipulated that the three southern wharves are export wharves, and the four southeastern wharves are import wharves. Both sides near the wharves are built with wind-facing dams to prevent hurricanes and protect the safety of moored ships. The draft of ships entering and exiting has been investigated, and ships from the United States to Shanghai can pass freely. The railway that is now being built from Yunshan may be able to reach the middle of the island, and in the future, it will be connected directly to the import wharf. In addition, it is also planned to build branch roads, one leading to the export wharf. There are five roads planned for the entire port, all of which are straight lines and connected to each other. A park is built in the northeast, and all roads can reach it. The middle part still needs to be leveled for building houses. The entire project is divided into two parts. All the mountain excavation and water digging projects are contracted by the Dutch company. The construction of roads and houses is the responsibility of the port office. At present, the contracts signed with the Dutch company are for two parts: the excavation of the stone mountain in the southeast and the construction of the wind-facing dam at the entrance. The project funds are 16 million US dollars. The mountain excavation work has already started. The dam construction project will have to wait until next year because the machines and all the application materials have not arrived (end).</p>
<h3 id="e74">Hong Kong and Guangdong Industrial and Commercial Bank Suspends Business <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>A correspondent from Hong Kong reported that the Hong Kong Industrial and Commercial Bank was established in 1915. The head office is located in Hong Kong, and branches are located in Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places. The business has always been quite stable. When the Huashang Bank went bankrupt, it was affected by it. The depositors were panicked and went to withdraw money one after another. However, at that time, the bank had sufficient capital to cope with the situation, and the storm was safely overcome. There have been several storms since then, but nothing happened as a result. Until last month, the bank and the East Asia Bank experienced a rush to withdraw money at the same time. After three or four days, it was fine again. At that time, the bank extended its business hours. At the same time, the shareholders of the bank planned to increase the capital of the bank by another one million yuan. However, at that time, some shareholders thought it was better to convene shareholders from all over the world to attend the meeting and increase the capital by 1.5 million yuan, which would be more appropriate. This matter was still under discussion yesterday, but it did not become a reality. The bank suddenly suspended business yesterday on the 2nd.</p>
<p>According to Zheng Tieru, chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Banks Association and president of the Bank of China, the temporary suspension of business of the Industrial and Commercial Bank was purely due to the influence of the Shanghai branch of the bank. On June 30, the Chinese banks in Hong Kong received a telegram from Shanghai, saying that the situation of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Bank was already very serious, but they did not know that it would come to such a state. The reason for its suspension of business was that it released too much money and could not be recovered on time. I still remember that on June 30, the Shanghai branch of the bank paid 500,000 yuan for settlement and payment of wages. If the person in charge had a ghost in his heart, this number could be saved back, so the occurrence of this incident can be said to be completely accidental. The Shanghai branch of the bank has more business, so it was affected by it. Also, when the Shanghai branch was in a bad situation, the Hong Kong head office remitted hundreds of thousands of yuan to the Shanghai branch on June 30 to cope with the situation, but this hundreds of thousands of yuan did not help. Now it is found that the most deposited money in the bank is the savings department. If the bank cannot continue to operate, the losses suffered by the middle and lower classes will be deep, because the money deposited in the savings department is mostly from the middle and lower classes. As for the follow-up arrangements, it is said that there are two options. First, whether the shareholders of the bank can increase the capital stock now. If they still increase the capital stock now, they can continue to operate after the resolution. Second, it is to liquidate. After the liquidation, how to repay the deposits is a later matter. At present, the bank is guarded by an Indian policeman, and there is a sign on the gate that says "The bank is temporarily closed and will be reopened later". The impact on the Hong Kong business community is also very great.</p>
<p>Also, a Guangzhou correspondent reported that the Guangzhou branch of the Hong Kong Industrial and Commercial Bank officially declared bankruptcy at 1:20 pm yesterday on the 2nd because it could not maintain its operations. Previously, the branch had a rush to withdraw</p>

<p>Business News	Financial Gold Market Changes Strongly, All Day Confused and Tortuous</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 7th), the gold market situation was extremely volatile and bizarre, with unpredictable ups and downs, impossible to grasp. The morning was weak, the afternoon rallied, and then it fell back into a state of decline. The total fluctuation for the day reached more than fourteen taels, with constant risks. Foreign exchange was tight, but banks made some deposits and withdrawals. The market’s firms advanced irregularly, such as Senchangyong, Bingyu, Zhifengyong, and Yongjun buying, while Yongcheng, Changtai, Kangcheng, and Hengyu were selling. Yu Dafu and Yongyuancheng Yong, etc., supplied and then demanded. Since the early market had more sellers, and it was rumored that cash exports were strictly prohibited, people were panicked, and the market opened lower, once falling to six hundred and two taels. Afterwards, it seemed to look upward slightly, due to buyer activity. Later, large accounts followed up and entered the market, because some spot goods were sold, or could be shipped to the north, etc. As a result, the market sentiment soared, suddenly breaking through six hundred and ten taels. Later, the sellers seemed to be in the majority, and Yu Da, Hengyu, Bingyu, Yuancheng, Yong, etc., all sold, while Zhifengyong, Fuchang, etc., bought positions. At first, the momentum was strong, but now it has appeared at six hundred and sixteen taels, but the atmosphere was not good. Suddenly, the wind and rain came together, plummeting eight or nine taels, breaking through six hundred and ten taels. The exchange rate was also weak, and the huge changes were staggering. Yesterday was Monday, with no major telegraphs. The telegraph from the day before yesterday showed that the near term was slightly lower by one-sixteenth, the far term was as before, and the silver price was also lower by one-eighth.</p>
<p>Morning Market Weak but Recovering</p>
<p>The opening price for August was six hundred and five taels, a decrease of two taels and five mace. The gross price rose from six hundred and two taels to zero seven taels, but the firms had already bought in again. First, the announcement was made without any changes, and then it returned to six hundred and five taels, three or four mace. Shortly afterwards, it added more than one tael, reaching six hundred and seven taels, due to purchases by retail investors, and the foreign exchange turned stable. The recent Bank of Japan bought one tael, three mace, five fen, three seven five. After ten o'clock, it was suppressed to five taels, seven or eight mace. Afterwards, due to spot activity, the price increased by one or two taels compared to last Saturday. There were many rumors of shipments to the north. Large accounts such as Zhifengyongfu and Yongyu Da competed to buy, suddenly soaring seven or eight taels. September U.S. dollar bank mutual trading was thirty-six yuan seventy-five. Recent British gold pairing was five pence nine three seven five. By eleven o'clock, it reached thirteen taels, seven or eight mace. Then it fell by more than two taels, but the buyers did not slacken and continued to rise. At eleven thirty, it was fifteen taels, seven or eight mace. In a flash, it retreated by more than two taels to thirteen taels, two or three mace. At noon, it was fourteen taels, eight mace, and the closing price at noon was fourteen taels, two mace.</p>
<p>Evening Market Returns to Declining Territory</p>
<p>The post-market opening was flat, at thirteen taels, eight mace, followed by twelve taels, half mace. There were some sellers, but Zhifengyong, etc., competed to buy, and it was rumored that the Indian exchange rate had fallen, which boosted morale, reaching six hundred and sixteen taels. However, the trend in the foreign exchange market was loose, and the September British gold bank could sell at six pence. Moreover, Tianyu, Yongyu Da, Yuancheng Yong, Chunyuanyong, etc., had all sold, and the market sentiment suddenly declined, with eager retreats and a sharp drop of ten taels. Recent British gold could be settled at six pence, but the fluctuations of more than two taels were quite treacherous. Until four twenty, it finally fell to six hundred and six taels, six mace. The closing price at four thirty was six hundred and six taels, eight mace, a drop of seven mace compared to last weekend.</p>
<p>Announced Price Press Small Fifty Taels Outside. The maximum price during the day was six hundred and sixteen taels, and the minimum price was six hundred and two taels, a difference of fourteen taels. The announced price in the morning was six hundred and sixty-three taels, pressed small fifty-seven taels to forty-eight or nine taels. In the afternoon, the initial pressure was fifteen taels, and the final pressure was small fifty-five or six taels. The market's front and back markets both closed at the same price. In the morning, July was registered at six hundred and twelve taels, August at fourteen taels. In the afternoon, July was zero six taels, and August was zero eight taels. The pre-water replenishment was twelve taels, and the post-calculation was zero six taels.</p>
<p>Different Firms' Entries and Exits. Trading by various firms was still fresh. Zhifengyong, Senchangyong, Bingyu, Yuancheng, Yuanheng, Tongfengyong, and Yifengyong all bought. Yuancheng Yong, Dadecheng, Yu Dafu Xingyong, etc., sold first and then bought. Hengxing, Datong, Yongtaiheng, Yuantai, Kangcheng, and Yongchengchang all sold. In the afternoon, Zhifengyong, Fuchang, Jinda Yong, etc., all bought. Fuyu, Chunyuan Yong, Yongfeng, Bingxing, Fuxingyong, Yu Da, Yuancheng Yong, Changchang, Hou Kangyong, Hengxing, etc., all sold. The Dalian gang sold more than six hundred bars in total, and then bought more than one hundred bars. The Guangdong gang had already sold more than one thousand bars. The trend of the foreign market is firm and strong.</p>
<p>Market Overview. Looking back at previous years, the financial market situation in the summer was already in a state of silence and sluggishness. The so-called rise and fall issues were generally ignored. It was necessary to wait for the hot weather to pass and the new coolness to enter the order before it would slowly come to life and gradually develop. This year, due to various issues with high demand for foreign goods, the situation has become the opposite. The current firmness of the silver price is unmatched by the spring silk cocoon news. This is probably because the market and time are different, and it is not possible to review the old examples.</p>
<p>Discounted Silver Prices (Foreign Silver). The average price in both the morning and afternoon markets was seven mace, two fen, five li and a half, the same as the afternoon market of the previous day. During the competition in the market price, there was indeed a fierce confrontation. The difference in bidding prices was always one or two li, as if neither side would give in. As a result, for the sake of a tie, the original price was the limit, so the trading time was extended. (Silver Discount) The market price of silver discount in both the morning and afternoon markets was one mace and one fen, slightly better than the previous day by several fen, and the situation was slightly firmer. The mark-up with water was done at one mace, two or three fen, and the bank's listed price was still four fen.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions. The supply and demand for small Jiangnan silver coins were slack, and transactions were weak. As a result, the market price was also very chaotic. The morning market was six mace, two fen, four li and a half, and the afternoon market was six mace, two fen, four li. The difference was only half a li. The transaction volume was 2,000 jiao in the morning market and 1,500 jiao in the afternoon market. The early market for small Guangdong silver coins was six mace, zero five li and a half, and the afternoon market was six mace, zero five li and two hao and a half. As a result, there were ups and downs of more than one li in the morning and afternoon markets compared with the previous day, and it stood in a moderate position. The transaction volume was 155,000 jiao in the morning market and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were still at 390,000 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver Funds). Yesterday was Monday, and the collection and settlement were more complicated. Chinese merchants collected and settled bills and funds of 3.3 million to 3.4 million, foreign merchants collected and settled bills and funds of more than 2.1 million, advances of 1.2 million, special collections of more than 1.5 million, and various cargo exchange taxes and other collections of more than 1.01 million. The inflow into warehouses was 800,000, and the outflow from warehouses was 600,000. The Japanese bank collected and settled various funds of more than 5.1 million, with an inflow of 1.2 million into warehouses. Qianzhuang Yingong collected and settled more than 38.8 million, with mark-up collections of more than 5.2 million, and various exchange collections of more than 1.5 million, and cash settlements of more than 1 million. (Foreign Funds). The exchange and bill transactions in the early market were 1.525 million, and in the afternoon market were 1.26 million. The paper money in the early market was 15,000, and in the afternoon market was 34,000. Outside the market, the paper money in the early market was 184,000, and in the afternoon market was 85,000. Spot silver in the early market was 120,000, and in the early market was 65,000. Bank transactions were 500,000 in the early market, and 380,000 in the afternoon market. Various banks' foreign accounts received and settled more than 1.8 million, with more than 2 million in paper money inflows and outflows. Qianzhuang Yanggong collected and settled 4.7 to 4.8 million, foreign exchange mark-up was more than 200. Tens of thousands, borrowing foreign funds was more than 2.3 million, the transaction volume of small Qianzhuang was 800,000 to 900,000, the source was more than 400,000, the current foreign exchange went to the stomach was 1.2 million, and the new currency was 500,000. Common silver coins lost their balance.</p>
<p>Inner Story of Standards</p>
<p>Before and after the silver cheapening trend in Shanghai, there was a distinction between silver coins with and without added water. Although there was a silver price as a standard, it became natural after a long time and eventually became a habit that could not be abolished. The following are some examples to prove that silver coins have lost their balance standard. 1. British silver coins add water. Currently, at least two to three fen are added according to the market price. 2. Yuan coins add water. Currently, at least three to four li are added according to the market price. 3. New coins (i.e., Zhongshan coins) add water. Currently, at least one to two li are added according to the market price. 4. Bank checks sometimes drop directly, and sometimes add 625, or 125. 5. More current silver is sometimes issued directly, and sometimes 0625. The above five types are those that need to add water according to the market price. As for the so-called standard silver coins, only the above four types are commonly used in Shanghai (the four bank checks are not common coins, so they are excluded). In the currency system, now all four types need to add water. Moreover, when selling paper money in cash, it is necessary to deduct one hao and two hu ban, or 1875, according to the market price. If this is the case, the value of paper money will be lower than the standard. Silver coins, current silver, and paper money of the same circulation are relatively clumsy. If this becomes a habit after a long time, the paper money will invisibly lose its inherent position with silver coins. Although the current rise and fall are very small, who knows that it will not expand and become more serious in the future? Therefore, knowledgeable people are deeply worried about the future. Foreign Exchange Slightly Looser</p>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's foreign exchange listing price did not change, but the buying and selling price fluctuated slightly. It was still flat in the morning, but tight at noon, because the gold market turned from weak to strong, and it had broken out of six hundred and fifteen taels. Later, the market rallied and then weakened, breaking through six hundred and ten taels, so it also turned loose, chaotic and uncertain, making people panic and be at a loss. The result was compared to last Saturday, the first order was long zero six two five, the U.S. dollar was long one eight seven five, and the Japanese gold was reduced by seventy-five. As for the trading and delivery of Chinese speculators, the British gold was roughly concluded at 100,000 pounds, sold by Mitsui Wheat Bank in Shanghai, Korea, and Shengda, etc. occasionally sold tens of thousands of pounds, which were absorbed by Mitsui Sumitomo, and various banks mutually traded 130,000, and U.S. dollars were paired for 200,000 yuan. Chinese merchants rarely entered or exited, but Hui Da, etc., sold hundreds of thousands of yuan of Japanese exchange to Mitsui, Korea, and Korea had done the exchange rate of October Japanese-U.S. exchange for 49 yuan 4375 in the morning, which was similar to the listed price, but the market atmosphere was separated, and people's hearts were even more dazed.</p>
<p>The British Exchange Inner Market was one two five up and down. In the morning, the bid price for July was one shilling five pence nine three seven five, August was six pence, September was zero six two five, October was one two five, and the buying price was added zero six two five.

<p>Securities Bond Prices Started to Rise and Ended Weakly</p>
<p>Market Situation Continued to be Smooth, Transaction Volume Over 9.7 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of various public bonds in this port, spot goods were very clear in the morning, and in the afternoon, only the preparation and dispatch were more frequent, and the others were still sparse as before. The futures market was still prosperous, and the morale of both buyers and sellers was more active than before. It is estimated that 600,000 to 700,000 were opened in the morning and 3.5 million yuan in the afternoon. As for the changes in various bond prices, although the sell-out transactions in the initial market in the morning were still very active, the morale of buyers was far better than before, and the prices were generally rebounded as before, such as customs duties, demobilization and various bonds had risen by about one yuan, but then the buying sentiment gradually turned calm and the selling situation was still strong, so the prices of various bonds gradually revolved and lowered. The trend was very peaceful, only the entire six slightly rebounded compared to the end of last week, the seven-year rehabilitation had ups and downs, and the others were generally continued to be weak, and the number was only a few corners, the bond class period or cash</p>
<p>The above table shows the pre-opening, post-closing, comparison with the previous day, and transaction volume for various bonds:</p>

<p>Yarn, Cotton, and Guangdong Cloth Sales Were Remarkably Strong, Market Trend Moving Towards a Bright Future</p>
<p>Actual Sales Opened 22,349 Bales</p>
<p>The yarn market is gradually tending towards stability. Because some manufacturers in this port, in order to avoid the pain of overproduction and difficulty in operation, have stopped night work or reduced work. Although the actual sales are not significantly smooth, they are still continuous. Furthermore, the off-season will pass and the peak season will arrive, so there should be no large increase in inventory in the future, and the market will also be able to turn from a revolving position to a stable situation. However, the sluggishness of overseas markets has dealt a major blow. However, it is not enough to worry about if the actual sales can turn smooth. Now, Guangdong Cloth sales are suddenly strong, and the market trend is moving towards a bright future. If the current situation can be settled as soon as possible, the needs of various places will increase. The smoothness of Guangdong and Huai Cloth sales is one example. Therefore, the advancement and retreat of the yarn market will be judged by whether the actual sales are smooth or not. However, the depreciation of Japanese yarn and competitive sales have a not small impact.</p>
<p>Standard Prices Also Advanced, Manpower Yarn. In the morning, with the great success of Guangdong cloth sales, morale was boosted, and the buying trend followed. The current month rose by eight qian, and the remaining months rose by one tael two qian to one tael four qian. In the afternoon, the third-grade yarn continued to fall, and the market atmosphere was sluggish again. Prices fell back by one qian to five qian in each month. Statistics show that the total transaction volume for the day was 24,050 bales.</p>
<p>Manpower Closing Prices, Rise and Fall, Inventory Balances, October: 1567, Up 13, 28,450 bales. July: 1563, Up 8, 19,150 bales. November: 265, Up 10, 26,850 bales. August: 1565, Up 12, 27,250 bales. December: 263, Up 9, 5,550 bales. September: 156, Up 12, 27,150 bales.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Trading Was Smooth. The spot yarn market was very smooth, with the strongest appetite in Guangdong. Statistics show that actual sales were 12,349 bales, and the industry bought 790 bales. Prices rose by about five qian to one tael. Guangdong bought 10,710 bales, Sichuan bought 420 bales, Niuzhuang bought 300 bales, Shantou bought 135 bales, Tianjin bought 130 bales, Hankou bought 205 bales, Changsha bought 200 bales, Wuhu bought 100 bales, Xuzhou bought 70 bales, and inland areas bought 60 bales. Jiangxi Ningbo Yantai Haizhou and other areas bought more than 20 bales.</p>
<p>The Origin of Cotton Market Firm Rise.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Improved... There Were Rumors of Floods in the Han Region.</p>
<p>The cotton market has progressed with the yarn market. Furthermore, with rumors of floods in the Han region, morale is boosted and firm. The future trend of the cotton market seems to have little possibility of development. American cotton, which has always held the world cotton market, is entrusted with the decline in the world cotton industry and reduced consumption. It is estimated that the total consumption is 13.4 million bales, a decrease of about 1.6 million bales compared with the entrustment. The entrustment end inventory is estimated at 6 million bales, and it seems difficult for the world cotton industry to reach its best state for the time being. Therefore, it seems that it is still difficult to expect its consumption to increase, and the reduction rate of new cotton fields is less than 10% according to various reports, so its future is also pessimistic. Moreover, the low price of Indian cotton and the development and promotion of new planting cotton fields have a great impact on the cotton market. With such an environment, future development seems to have to wait. Although the abundance or shortage of domestic cotton production has a direct relationship, it seems difficult to seek its development alone in the face of the decline of the world cotton market. However, the relatively small inventory, the reduction of new cotton fields, and the poor growth conditions are all enough to stabilize morale. However, it is difficult to run counter to the trend of the world cotton industry.</p>
<p>The Wuhan Standard Suddenly Rose by Three or Four Qian. The Shanghai Exchange's Wuhan Standard rose sharply by four or five qian in the morning in all months due to the sharp rise in the yarn market and reports of floods in Hubei Province, which boosted morale. It fell back by one or two qian in the afternoon with the yarn market. Statistics show that 44,100 dan were traded. The closing prices of Wuhan Standard are listed below, with the rise and fall and inventory balances:</p>
<p>January: 3535, Up 40, 88,400</p>
<p>July: 3555, Up 35, 58,500</p>
<p>November: 3525, Up 30, 76,400</p>
<p>August: 3580, Down 35, 87,900</p>
<p>December: 3515, Up 35, 25,700</p>
<p>The Demand for Spot Cotton is Still Clear. The demand for spot cotton is sluggish, but the market is firm due to the improvement in yarn sales. 700 bales of Yaohua cotton arrived at the pier, and the transaction prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Ping Geer: 20.25, Yongyu Factory bought 250 pieces</p>
<p>Spot Delivery to Factory Yaohua: 32.20, Customer Gang bought 3,400 bales</p>
<p>Spot Delivery at the Warehouse: 32.80</p>

<p>British and Indian Cotton Industry Weekly News.</p>
<p>Mumbai: In the past week, Europe inquired about new cotton, but recently there has been some selling. China is more interested, and Japanese exporters have purchased large quantities of Omra cotton. There was widespread rainfall in the cotton area during the week, and the monsoon was very strong. The rainfall so far has been sufficient to benefit cotton area planting, and the cotton harvest news is generally smooth, but there are reports of excessive rainfall in the Central Provinces.</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot cotton inquiries continued to be good last week, and futures were calm. The market price failed to rise due to the favorable U.S. cotton weather report. Currently, morale is bearish, but prices are still firm. Market participants seem to be waiting for the U.S. cotton government report to be released before taking action. Egyptian cotton is still calm.</p>
<p>Grain</p>
<p>Depressed Rice Market in He Xia</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, there were still no registered white japonica rice boats, and the hulls have been completed. Only two boats of secondary goods remain, which have not been evaluated. Because the difference between the two parties talking about the goods is close to a corner, they have not been able to open the hatch. There are dozens of stones of sheep indica rice, which should be sold by this street, but the price is not close, so it has become quiet. The market price is between 20.05 and 20.06 jiao. Bianyuan goods are also about to run out, and the river inventory is almost non-existent. The market price is similar to the previous day. At the moment, the river market is extremely depressed.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: The source of goods arriving in He Xia is still sparse, and Beijin and Baodao are also lacking. All kinds of sheep indica rice are also extremely desolate. Because there have been occasional arrivals in recent days, they are all small numbers, so buyers have not paid attention and have switched to foreign rice as the standard. The situation of Baiyuan is flat, the arrival of goods is increasingly scarce, sales are not smooth, and the market price is still around 19 yuan. Dajiao rice is uniquely less than two corners.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Foreign Rice Market Situation</p>
<p>Customer sales are still sluggish. Although there are no large tickets arriving at the port, the inventory is sufficient. Moreover, Tokyo rice and Annamese japonica rice shipped from Hong Kong arrive at the rate of 5,000 to 6,000 bags per day, so the market is still extremely weak. Saigon Mindang and Annamese japonica rice are still sold in this street, and rough rice is sold in this street in the interior, so it is relatively stable. Only Dajiao rice has more inventory and less digestion, so the price has continued to fall by about two corners. The other kinds of rice are only slightly soft. The total market opened 1,000 bags of Dajiao rice, priced at 16 to 15.8 yuan. Annamese japonica rice continues to arrive and is priced at only 19.2 jiao to 19.02 jiao. Tokyo No. 1 is 18.8 jiao. Except for Dajiao, there are about 8,000 bags in total, and about 5,000 bags of rough rice, and the price has seen a soft decline of several points.</p>
<p>Flour Prices Trending Upward</p>
<p>Closing Time Turned Slightly Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market still saw bullish sentiment in the morning and afternoon. The main reason at the moment is the quotation for wheat in the interior. Because of the relationship with rice prices, even though it is the peak season, it has not fallen. This is the main reason why flour prices cannot be low. Although Tianjin is in the midst of a ban on transportation, the needs of various parties are such that every new goods location is bound to gradually become smooth. Because after the green and yellow, it is a matter of fact that it must be filled with inventory. Moreover, in previous years, after the new wheat appeared on the market, manufacturers would also buy as much as possible. Now, because the price is expensive, many things are on the sidelines. Therefore, because the manufacturers do not have enough goods, they are inevitably stretched and difficult to cope with when the sales market is launched. Observing this situation, the position of manufacturers this year seems to have reached its limit of difficulty. When the afternoon was approaching closing time, it was heard that the Social Bureau, based on reports from others, reported that the Yingkou gang had bought 100,000 bags of current futures, fearing that the people's food would be affected again, and also investigated the closing market price of the exchange to stabilize it, or that was why. As a result, this month was good for five li, August was good for one fen, September was good for one and a half fen, October was good for one fen, November was good for five li, and December was good for one fen yun.</p>
<p>Wheat Futures Stepping Towards a High Flight</p>
<p>High-Grade Spot Wheat Rose by One Qian</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the market prices in each month were consistent in seeing a rise. Because the wheat prices in the interior have always been bullish, the manufacturers had the intention of suppressing them for a few days last week, but the degree of market rise was slightly moderate. Until yesterday, because the environment became increasingly worse, the manufacturers could no longer suppress it, so the market situation stepped towards a high flight and the rising wind was quite strong. Looking forward, the first thing is that rice prices must fall, so that people's hearts can relax, or the market can be close to the quotation of foreign wheat to have a way to remedy it. As a result, each month from this month to September rose by seven fen, October rose by six fen, November rose by seven fen, and December rose by nine fen. The spot wheat market also saw a sharp increase. Because it was useless for the manufacturers to stubbornly resist, they had to start raising the price. The high-grade goods rose by one qian compared with the previous week, and the middle and secondary grades also reached five or six fen. Kaisha City, Yaowan, Pu Town, Gao Youguan, Jiangxi, Shuangfeng, Penglai, Chuzhou, a total of more than 10,000 bags, were handled by factories such as Fuxin, Fufeng, and Shenda. Also, the exchange announced that the standard wheat market price exceeds 5.25 taels, and the evidence money will be changed to 300 taels per cart yun.</p>
<p>Standard Soybean Cake Rose</p>
<p>Yesterday, Dalian had border-term cakes, and the buying sentiment was very good. Customers in each market in the morning and afternoon had a very active intention to buy, but the sellers watched and did not sell, so there were only a few transactions, and the price therefore rose. At the moment, the upper period of July has reached about 2.06 taels, which is better than the end of last week by two fen. The exchange has now implemented a proof money of 200 taels per 1,000 pieces of standard yuan.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<p>Japanese Car Sugar Gradually Trending Upward</p>
<p>Coarse Sand and White City Also Turned Stiff</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market produced area telegraphs. Cuban spot sugar and New York futures sugar had no telegraphs. The price of Java spot sugar was 8.625, the price of July futures sugar was 8.50, and the price of August-September was 8.375, with no increase or decrease compared to the previous telegraphs. The association market’s planned plate, the atmosphere of Dutch sugar 24 coarse sand and white city turned stiff, and the call price was high, and the transaction price reached 7 taels 8 qian half, the transaction was particularly quiet, and the market shape was peaceful. No. 20 medium sand white was 7 taels 8 qian 2 fen half, the transaction was sparse, and No. 10 Dutch red was 6 taels 7 qian, and the market was firm and beautiful. The Japanese sugar market saw a slight increase. The price of YRO mark was 8 taels, the YT mark was 8 taels 1 qian half, the YP mark was 8 taels 3 qian 2 fen half, and it rose to 8 taels 3 qian half. In the post-market, the sellers further raised the price, so the buyers stopped, and there was no</p>

<p>Convened Yesterday to Consider Naval Treaty</p>
<p>Opposition Attempts to Delay</p>
<p>Supporters Prevent Absences</p>
<p>▲ Associated Press, Washington, June 6: According to the latest news today, President Hoover intends to submit his opinion on the London Naval Treaty to the Senate today, regardless of whether there is a quorum. Senator Watson claimed that he intended to send Senate guards to search for senators who</p>
<p>avoided attending the special Senate meeting, and those who still resisted would be arrested. This statement is shocking because the United States has never had such a precedent. According to the declaration of Senator Allen, the center of opposition to the London Treaty is concentrated among naval</p>
<p>opposition personnel in various countries. The trend of this treaty will prevent the naval tonnage of the UK and Japan from being increased, while the United States will have the advantage of building as much as possible within its comparative capacity.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, June 6: It is said that supporters of the London Naval Treaty are now plotting to put the treaty to a vote within ten days. Opponents are trying to delay, believing that delay is beneficial to them and the longer the delay, the more opponents of the treaty there will be. It is said that if there is a lack of a quorum when the vote is reached, the supporters of the treaty intend to find ways to force the senators to attend the meeting. At the same time, the government authorities are also making every effort to lobby the Senate, and President Hoover is paying special attention to this matter, hoping that the treaty will be approved as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, July 7: The naval four giants meeting consisting of the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Navy Taniguchi, the Chief of Naval Operations Okada, and the former Minister of Navy Kato, continued after the day before and convened again yesterday morning at 10:00 at the Minister of Navy's official residence in Kasumigaseki to discuss the new national defence plan and the Japanese policy for the upcoming disarmament conference in 1935. Former Minister Kato argued that replacing 8-inch gun cruisers with 6-inch gun cruisers creates a huge shortfall in force, and that submarines and aircraft have completely different capabilities, so using aircraft to make up for the lack of submarines is unreasonable, and the economic cost of using aircraft as a substitute is also very high. He forcefully attacked from the standpoint of military operations, focusing on two points, and finally strongly stated that when the marshal's conference consults the advisory officials' conference on the issue of military strength, the military will respond that the military</p>
<p>The force amount in the London Treaty Three-Country Agreement has real shortcomings for Japan. General Okada rose to mediate, saying that if the amount of military force is deemed insufficient, the result would be a denial of the London Treaty itself, which is very regrettable for Japan's national defence. At this time, a supplementary proposal can be admitted, and efforts should be made to implement the three major principles in the next parliament. But former Minister Kato still disagreed, and even though Finance Minister Taniguchi explained, he still did not agree. The meeting broke up unhappily at 2:30 p.m., and a third meeting was scheduled for today.</p>

<p>Liu Hongsheng, chairman of the Jiangsu Match United Association, and others have initiated the organization of a large-scale domestic match company to resist the Swedish Match, known as the world's match king. The plan is to merge the existing "Shanghai", "Zhonghua" and "Yingchang" companies, gather the strength of the three companies to deal with the foreign Swedish Match. Among the three companies, Yingchang Company is the largest in scale, with three branch factories, one in Pudong, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, etc. The second is Zhonghua, with two factories, and the third is Suzhou Hongsheng Factory. After the merger of the three factories, the capital will be 3 million yuan. The amount of shares will be proportional to the size of the factory. It is also planned to establish a large China Match Shares Preparatory Office at 38 Ai Duo Ya Road in Shanghai. Mr. Liu Hongsheng is the director of the preparatory office. For more than ten days, he has been actively preparing, and everything is almost ready. It has been submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for registration and will officially open soon. After the merger of the three companies, the wholesale headquarters will be established in Shanghai, and it is planned to establish a distribution office in Suzhou. Distribution offices must also be established in other places such as Nanjing and Zhenjiang to promote sales. As for the manufacturing factories, the existing factories will be used without setting up new factories, or the names of the factories will not be changed, and the trademarks will also not be changed. Only the three words "Great China" will be added, such as "Great China Hongsheng Factory" or "Great China Yingchang Factory" to identify them and facilitate the evaluation of improved products.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Appeal of Cotton Merchants for Inspection <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Continuing to Submit to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to Reform Bad Practices</p>
<p>The Shanghai China Cotton Industry Association continued to submit to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday, requesting a thorough reform of cotton inspection and detailing that cotton merchants did not actually misunderstand or have other intentions. The text read: Submitting to the thorough cotton inspection previously submitted, the association did not misunderstand, and how dare it have other intentions. I believe that improving cotton production is not the responsibility of your ministry, and the purpose of cotton inspection is to eliminate the addition of water and</p>
<p>impurities. May I ask, who is actually doing the adding of water and impurities? Since your ministry established inspection bureaus in Hankou, Ningbo, and other places, has it been discovered that vendors are adding water and impurities in commodity distribution locations? In fact, this is done by a small number of bad elements, small vendors, and farmers. To eradicate the disadvantages, it is definitely not the responsibility of the vendors. In that case, commodity distribution locations have nothing to do with inspection, and what is the value of having an inspection bureau? If it is said to improve international trade, then from the fundamental point of view, it is possible to start inspecting goods that are sold overseas. Cotton merchants are not resolutely opposed to the government implementing inspections, but because of the layers of exploitation, the pain is too deep, almost to the point of being unable to do business, so they have to be bold and state clearly. I hope that the late Premier gave top priority to people's livelihood, and that your ministry also sympathizes with the difficulties of merchants. Since the opening of inspection bureaus in various places, what is the actual performance? It is difficult to hide from people's eyes. And if the cotton merchants are not deeply pained, how dare they make a sound of groaning without disease? As for the Shanghai Bureau Cotton Industry Consultant Meeting on September 10 last year, various local draft mimeographs were distributed on the spot. At that time, the consultants debated, and there was no result. The discussion also included how much natural moisture is contained, which should be resolved first, and then a reduction method should be determined. The director and the director did not have a correct answer. How would I know that the case was being discussed, and one party had not yet made a decision, and the other party had already submitted it to the department for approval, and the reduction method was announced and implemented. The so-called Cotton Merchant Consultant Meeting, the truth is almost like this. Your ministry has clear vision, I pray that you will calm down and examine the facts, reform all the bad practices of the cotton inspection office, so that the merchants will be relieved of their difficulties, and it will be very fortunate.</p>
<p>[P. China Steamer Navigation News&gt;</p>
<p>Aggressive Coastal Shipping by Foreign Merchants - Sea Vessels Suspend Service to Hunan - The Chinese sea vessels Ruohua Ping, Jiping, Beichang, Xinchang, etc., which resumed business at the beginning of last month, suspended commercial service yesterday. The ships have hired Yangtze River pilots and loaded ten days' worth of fuel, and will depart from yesterday morning for the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, with destinations in Changsha, Yuezhou, and other ports.</p>
<p>Xin Ming Temporarily Refunds Tickets - Since the North-South Transportation Was Blocked</p>
<p>Since the North-South traffic was cut off, the passenger traffic to and from Shanghai on Northern Ocean steamers has been very crowded. Each ship can sell at least eight or nine thousand yuan each time. Yesterday, the China Merchants Bureau's Xin Ming ship received a temporary order to stop going to Tianjin. The ship had already sold all levels of passenger seats, and passengers were refunding their tickets one after another, changing to foreign ships. Xin Ming's accounting office was very busy yesterday handling ticket refunds.</p>
<p>Ning Shao Passengers and Goods Unloaded - The Ning Shao Company's Ning Shao ship, which was launched this time, arrived in Shanghai on the 5th, loaded goods on the same day, and was scheduled to leave Shanghai for Wuhan on the morning of the 6th. Many passengers went to the bureau to report and transport goods for export. However, when the ship received the order to stop sailing, the company announced to the passengers that most of the goods had already been declared and would be unloaded.</p>
<p>All the goods to be carried were refunded. It was not completed until yesterday.</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Take the Opportunity to Resume Service - The Japanese merchant Showa Yoko's Northern Ocean service vessels, after the Tianjin Customs imposed double taxes, changed the Northern Ocean vessels to Southern China lines due to the small amount of cargo going from Shanghai. Now, seeing that Chinese merchant vessels on the North China route have all temporarily suspended service, and the verification and unloading of goods at Tianjin Customs has been allowed to be handled flexibly, the company decided yesterday to resume the Shanghai-Tianjin service from now on to compete for goods and passengers on the Northern Ocean route.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Reduce Freight Rates - British merchants Taikoo, Jardine, etc., foreign merchant vessels, in order to attract the export of staple goods to the Northern Ocean, took advantage of the fact that Tianjin can now be unloaded and Chinese vessels are not operating, and decided to reduce freight rates to attract passengers and goods. Yesterday, it was heard that the Zhongjing had agreed to reduce the freight rate for staple goods from Shanghai to Tianjin from 14 taels and 3 and a half qian to 12 taels, and had notified the passengers.</p>

<p>The Taikoo Company's Jiang steamer Wuhu sailed on its maiden voyage from Shanghai to Wuhan on the 27th of last month and went directly to Yichang. However, when it was leaving Shanghai, the ship collided with a barge while turning around. After the ship sailed out, it was discovered that the propeller was damaged, so the ship could not sail upstream when it arrived in Wuhan. All the cargo was unloaded in the Wuhan warehouse, preparing to be towed back to Shanghai for repairs before sailing again, so it had not yet entered the port yesterday.</p>

<p>The Huaan merchant ship of the Changan Shipping Company, which sails between Fuzhou and Shanghai, has been plagued by rampant pirates in various sea areas in recent times, and navigation is extremely dangerous. For the safety of the ship, cargo, and passengers, it has been specially approved by the Navy Department to order the Wusong National Coast Guard to send ten naval soldiers to station on the ship and protect it. Wu Zhennan, the director of the Coast Guard, has selected ten soldiers from his department and given them special training. The training has now been completed. At 2 p.m. yesterday, Director Wu personally supervised the trained soldiers to conduct live-fire drills at the gun platform to assess their performance. The results were satisfactory. They will be sent to the Huaan ship to escort it soon.</p>

<h3 id="e109">JISHENG HUI'S YIXING DISASTER RELIEF REPORT <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Hui, according to a report from Director Zhang Junzhongkuan in Yixing, who is in charge of disaster relief efforts, has listed the following: (1) Disaster Situation: Yixing experienced a flood in the 17th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1928], followed by drought and locusts in the 18th year [i.e., 1929]. Wealthy individuals avoided bandits and relocated elsewhere, while the poor had no means of borrowing. The county has too many migrant residents. The main products are bamboo and pottery. Currently, due to fear of bandits, no outside merchants inquire about purchasing these goods. Large quantities of goods are stockpiled like mountains, and tens of thousands of workers are unemployed, unable to obtain even a meager bowl of porridge each day. This has led many to take the wrong path. The southeastern and southwestern mountainous areas are the most severely affected by the disaster. The entire county is divided into fourteen districts, with districts four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine being mountainous. Districts four, five, and six are in the southeast, while districts seven, eight, and nine are in the southwest. Our association is focusing on the southeastern three districts first. (2) Bandit Situation: The county borders Changxing in Zhejiang, as well as Jianping and Guangde in Anhui. Situated on the edge of Tai Lake, bandits can easily appear and disappear. Due to economic pressure, many have been driven to take risks and become bandits. (3) Relief Funds: Our association is jointly operating with the Jiangsu Provisional Relief Association, with the aim of rescuing those who cannot survive without relief. We are carefully verifying households to strictly prevent fraudulent claims. (4) Relief Friends: We have invited Sun Changhou, Shao Ganchen, Ge Yutang, Zhong Huichu, Wang Shiyuan, and other gentlemen to set off in five groups on June 28th to investigate households in the mountainous areas. (6) Difficulties in Investigation and Reporting: The disaster areas in the county are all adjacent to mountains and connected to Tai Lake. Banditry is rampant, and disaster-stricken households are scattered. Some mountainsides are dozens of li, or even eight or ten li and some two, three, four, five, six, seven, or eight li. Disaster-stricken households are grouped into small villages of one, two, three, four, seven, or eight families. The weather is hot, the roads are treacherous, and climbing is difficult. Military protection is ineffective due to the limited number of firearms. Increasing the number of firearms would be costly. We are in a dilemma. We have agreed with our relief friends to be frugal and cautious, not sparing personal sacrifice, to personally investigate and distribute aid to the best of our abilities in order to provide relief to the disaster-stricken people and to live up to the generous intention of the gentlemen of your association to provide disaster relief. It is heard that the association’s second batch of Yixing relief funds has already been remitted by Tongxin Zhuang in this city to Yixing’s Dingkang Run Zhuang and will be transferred to Director Zhang for distribution.</p>
<p>General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</p>
<h3 id="e110">ZHAO TIEQIAO REPORTS ON THE COMPANY'S AFFAIRS <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>On the occasion of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's seventh anniversary on July 7th, General Manager Zhao reported on the company's affairs, saying: This reorganization of the company's internal structure has the following significance: (1) It aligns with economic principles; (2) It responds to the demands of the times; (3) It demonstrates the company's commitment to continuous improvement. When the company was first taken over, the previous methods were deemed unsuitable for reorganization. Reforms were added two years later, but they were not entirely satisfactory. Although the establishment of various departments and offices, as well as the consolidation of the business departments and the seemingly rash and disruptive splitting and merging of the Shanghai office, may appear superficially light and bothersome, they actually represent progress towards development, seeking a bright path for the company's future, which is no different from an automatic revolution. Therefore, based on the experience of reorganization over the past two years, a comprehensive reorganization is being carried out, based on economic principles and the requirements of the times. Since the beginning of the military unrest, the requisitioning of ships and the obstruction of freight transport have resulted in substantial tangible and intangible losses, making it necessary to reduce government expenditure and personnel. The dismissed personnel have not committed any misconduct, but their dismissal is due to budget constraints. In the future, when the company needs personnel, vacancies will be filled promptly. This reorganization is not limited to reducing government expenditure and personnel, but is based on the experience of reorganization over the past two years, combined with internal and external</p>
<p>shipping company systems, to carry out reforms aimed at increasing the efficiency of the company's colleagues. It starts with the management of the headquarters. It is now estimated that, from a passive perspective, savings in consumption can amount to more than 100,000 yuan per year. This</p>
<p>method can be extended to various branch offices, ships, machines, and affiliated institutions, and there will certainly be more to observe. At the same time, it is necessary to increase production from an active perspective, so the sum of one in and one out will certainly not be small. Over the past two years, I have known the abilities, knowledge, and experience of senior staff well. This time, the allocation of important responsibilities will certainly allow each to give full play to their strengths. The staff of each department will also be assigned duties by their respective department heads based on their abilities. Every move of the company is not only noticed by society, but also its appropriateness is closely related to the agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests of the entire country. It is hoped that colleagues will, from today onwards, pay attention to increasing</p>
<p>production and reducing consumption, and only then can they truly demonstrate their abilities, otherwise it will still be tantamount to self-disturbance. The organization and activities of various institutions are similar to machines. Assuming that power belongs to the government, like the power of a motor, I am the main belt of power transmission, the heads of each department are the branch belts of power transmission, and the staff of each department are the large and small wheels and the direct manufacturing machinery. In this way, each component can be considered sound and capable. From now on, we must always inspect each belt, each wheel, and each machine to see if there are any problems causing obstacles. Each department is responsible for its own duties and operates in an orderly manner, so the overall efficiency can naturally be improved. I am willing to encourage this with my colleagues.</p>

<h3 id="e112">HUANG BAIYING SHEDS TEARS OF SORROW IN COURT <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Baiying Case Heard for the Second Time Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Over Five Hundred Spectators Attend</p>
<p>Forty-odd Dance Hostesses Look Sleepy</p>
<p>Tong Sanmao's Testimony Highly Ridiculous</p>
<p>It has been nine days since dance hostess Huang Baiying was forced to take poison. During these nine days, the people of Shanghai who are concerned about this case have been eagerly awaiting its outcome. In particular, the topics discussed in dance halls are nothing more than Tong and Baiying. This is because dance hostesses have a sense of self-preservation, and every dance patron has a Baiying in their heart. Yesterday was the date for the second continuation of the trial. As many as five hundred spectators attended, with over a thousand eyes focused on this pitiful woman. As a result, every remark was heard attentively. When she described her loneliness and isolation, willing to sacrifice herself for others, sorrow arose from within, and tears streamed down her face. The entire audience was moved to sadness, while Tong Sanmao stood upright in the defendant's dock, uneasy. The judge asked a few questions, and his</p>
<p>witty answers caused laughter in the courtroom. The solemn atmosphere of the court seemed unable to restrain the sympathy for Baiying among the audience even in the slightest.</p>
<h3 id="e113">A TRUE PORTRAIT OF HUANG AND TONG'S ATTITUDES <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Many women were in the audience, about forty dance hostesses, but most had tired faces, probably due to insufficient sleep and having to rise early to attend court. Huang Baiying's complexion was slightly better than before, and her spirit was quite lively. She wore an ocher-colored floral gauze shirt, with a white satin black-edged open-front vest. Her hair was draped behind her, parted on both sides, occasionally revealing a haggard and delicate appearance.</p>
<p>Tong Sanmao wore a white serge suit, with his shirt collar loose and no tie. His face was concave and his forehead prominent, with sunken eyes. He spoke very unnaturally, standing tall in the defendant's dock, attracting much attention. Some in the audience jeered and ridiculed him, especially when the judge questioned him. His answers, such as "She snatched the pills and wouldn't let me eat them" and "I was afraid she wouldn't eat them, so I insisted she eat them," caused laughter. Huang Baiying, on the other hand, had a face full of resentment and disdain.</p>
<h3 id="e114">EXTREMELY POTENT PILLS <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The trial began at 8:45 a.m. yesterday. Judge Wu Tingqi and Prosecutor Guo Huaipu arrived in court and ordered the bailiffs to bring the defendant Tong Sanmao from the waiting room. First, Lawyer Li Zhishan, representing the police station, stood up and stated that the remaining sleeping pills taken by Huang Baiying had been sent by the police station to the health department for testing. The test results showed that the drug was extremely potent, with each tablet containing half a gram, equivalent to about seven and a half Chinese li. Taking one tablet can induce sleep, and the dose of seven tablets, or fifty li, can be fatal. Even less than seven tablets can be life-threatening and must be taken only on the advice of a doctor.</p>

<h3 id="e116">DETAILED RECORD OF BAIYING'S TESTIMONY <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Judge Wu then summoned Huang Baiying, who complied and stood at the witness stand, speaking fluent Mandarin. She stated that she was nineteen years old, a native of Guangdong, and resided in Shanghai's French Concession, Wanyi Lane, Luban Road. She worked as a dance hostess at the Paris Dance Hall on Jing'an Temple Road for over a year. She first met the defendant Tong Sanmao at the Datong Dance Hall around July or August of last year. Judge Wu then threw Huang Baiying's written record of her testimony at Baolong Hospital on June 30th to her for review, and asked if the record was accurate. He also asked if the words "Huang Baiying, twenty-nine" at the end of the record were her own handwriting. Huang examined it for a long time and then said that because she had taken poison at the time,</p>
<p>she was mentally confused, and it was difficult to remember whether she had signed the paper. She added that there were also inaccuracies in the record. Judge Wu then instructed her to describe the incident in detail. Huang said that on the night of the 29th of last month, after Tong finished dancing at the Paris Dance Hall, Mr. Fang Hengnian invited Tong and her to go out for a drive. She realized that Tong was going to make things difficult for her and tried to mediate. Unexpectedly, after getting into the car, Tong suddenly said to Fang, "You'll see in a week." At that time, the car was heading west. She did not pay attention to what Fang and Tong were saying in the car, so she did not know what they were saying. Later, when they drove to Beixinjing, the car stopped, and Tong and Fang both got out and talked. After a while, they got back in the car and drove back. At this time, Tong said to her in the car, "I have spent dozens of taels of silver to buy</p>
<p>a pistol, which I will use to shoot you." While speaking, he took out a bank passbook from his side and showed her the amount and date of the withdrawal. She was terrified at this moment. Tong then moved the seat cushion. Suspecting that something was amiss, she questioned him. Tong even</p>
<p>slapped her cheek. When the car reached Meibai Road, Mr. Fang said goodbye to them and got out of the car. Before leaving, Fang said to Tong, "Since you are friends with me, please do not make things difficult for Huang." After speaking, he turned away. Tong then instructed the driver to drive the car towards Wusong. Tong asked her in the car if she was willing to marry him. Because she was afraid, she shook her head repeatedly. Tong then asked her, "Can you or can't you?" She resolutely replied, "I can't." When the car drove to the bank of the Wusong River, Tong ordered the driver to get out of the car and then threatened her, saying, "This is where you will die. If you don't die now, then in the future, two people will have to die, or even three people will have to die." Huang Baiying burst into tears as she recounted this, but she still sobbed and continued to say that her parents had died early, "I am a lonely and weak woman. At that time, hearing Tong's words, I</p>
<p>decided to die to avoid harming others. I was about to throw myself into the river to commit suicide, but Tong stopped me again, saying that it was not good to die here. It would be better to take sleeping pills." He then ordered the driver to get back in the car and drive back, passing a place (i.e., the intersection of Huade Road and Zhaofeng Road). Tong then asked the driver to stop temporarily, and he got out of the car to buy medicine. After a while, he returned with a package of medicine and asked her for a yuan bill, then got out of the car again. Soon, he returned and ordered to drive straight to the gate of the Cangzhou Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. Because she had not slept all night, she was tired at this time, so she asked Tong to help her out of the car and into the room of the hotel (room number 201). Tong asked the waiter to bring four bottles of soda and ordered paper and pens. After everything was ready, Tong closed the door and took out the medicine bottle, pouring the pills on the table. He first ordered her to write a letter, saying that she could write everything she wanted to say in the letter. She obeyed his orders, spread out the paper, dipped the brush in ink, and wrote a letter. The letter was addressed to Ma Shaozhen (Ma is also a dance hostess) at the Paris Hotel Dance Hall, and asked her to forward it to Zhang. Judge Wu asked who Zhang was, and Huang said that she did not want to reveal his name. When Tong saw that she had finished writing the letter, he used his palm to break open the soda bottles and ordered her to swallow the pills with the water. She swallowed them and moved closer to the window, hoping to meet someone familiar and ask for help. But Tong did not want her to stand for long and forced her to lie down. She refused, and Tong said, "If you don't sleep, you won't die." So she lay down. After a while, Tong asked her how she felt. She replied that she</p>
<p>felt nothing. Tong suddenly remembered that when he arrived at the hotel, he had written his real name in Western letters on the guest card. He was afraid that if she died, he would be implicated, so he asked her to move to Datong. She refused, and he hired a car to take her to Baolong Hospital. After treatment by the doctor, she woke up the next day. Soon, a detective from the police station came to the hospital to take her statement. Judge Wu then asked Huang Baiying a few questions. He asked, "Do you want to marry Zhang?" She replied, "Yes." He asked, "Are you engaged?" She replied, "No." He asked, "When did you tell Tong that you were going to marry Zhang?" She replied, "I didn't say it." He asked, "What kind of person is Zhang?" She replied, "He is studying at school." He asked, "Which school?" She replied, "I don't want to say because it involves his reputation." He asked, "Did you say to Tong Sanmao that you were willing to die?" She replied, "I didn't say it." He asked, "Did you say to Tong Sanmao, 'I am going to marry Zhang and I am sorry to you'?" She replied, "I didn't say it." He asked, "Did you bring the pills?" She replied, "He bought them." He asked, "Did anyone see you taking the pills?" She replied, "No one knew."</p>
<h3 id="e117">TONG SANMAO'S WITTY REMARKS <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Judge Wu then summoned the defendant Tong Sanmao and instructed him, "Did you hear what Huang Baiying said today?" Tong replied, "I heard everything, but what she said is completely wrong." He asked, "Did you tell Huang about buying a gun in the car?" He replied, "I didn't tell her. After she took the poison, I wanted to take her to the hospital, but she didn't want to go. She also said that she had 400 yuan in cash at home and asked me to take it and escape." He asked, "Huang testified that in Wusong, you said to her that if Huang didn't die at that time, two people or even three people would have to die in the future. So, who were you trying to kill besides Huang? Was it Fang and Zhang?" He replied, "I didn't say that at the time. After returning from Song, I borrowed 30 yuan from a friend. Huang said that she had 12 yuan and that was enough. Huang then gave me one yuan to buy the pills, which cost 90 cents. After arriving at the Cangzhou Hotel and closing the room, I poured out the pills, intending to die together." He asked, "Since you wanted to die together, why didn't you take them first and force Huang to take them?" He replied, "I was afraid she wouldn't take them." He asked, "Then you should have swallowed them with her." He replied, "Huang had already swallowed all the pills, and there were none left for me to swallow." The audience then burst into laughter, and many privately discussed that Tong's words were witty, but Judge Wu had already realized that Tong was indeed a cunning person, so he stopped questioning him.</p>
<h3 id="e118">ADJOURNED HEARING FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION OF EVIDENCE <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The witness Rong Kai, a Cantonese employee of the Cangzhou Hotel, was summoned and questioned about the situation of Tong and Huang at the hotel. According to Rong, the two people came to open a room and left after only a quarter of an hour. The hotel waiter Li Houshan and the driver Shi Jiake also described what they saw. Fang Hengnian was also summoned and asked if he had seen Tong show Huang the passbook and if Tong had mentioned buying a gun. Fang said that he only saw Tong show Huang a book, and he did not know about the gun. Fang also repeated what he had said in court before. The lawyers for both sides also cross-examined each witness one by one. Judge Wu then instructed the defendant Tong Sanmao to be detained and adjourned the hearing to 8:00 a.m. on July 16th.</p>
<h3 id="e119">PROSECUTOR JIN HENIAN APPEALS THE LU GENRONG CASE <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Suzhou Quick News: In the case of the master-servant love affair between Huang and Lu, Lu Genrong, after the Higher Court concluded its second retrial and pronounced him not guilty, the original prosecutor, dissatisfied, filed an appeal. According to the initial judgment of the Lu District Court, the sentence was only two years. If there was no appeal, he could have been released after serving his time (the number of days of detention that have not been confirmed is usually counted as two days for one day). However, due to the appeal, the process was delayed, making it difficult for him to be released from prison. Now that an appeal has been filed, the Supreme Court will receive the notice, respond to the arguments, make a judgment, etc., which will inevitably require a certain period of time. A copy of the prosecutor's reasons for appeal was sent to Genrong by the Higher Court yesterday (the 7th). The full text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Notification Letter: Jiangsu Higher Court Notification Letter No. In the case of Lu Genrong from Wuxian helping with theft, the judgment was delivered on July 4th, 1920 [actually, the 19th year of the Republic, which is 1930]. The prosecutor has been granted permission to appeal the judgment of this court and has submitted an appeal brief stating the reasons for the appeal. A copy of the brief is hereby sent for your information. You must submit a response brief to this court in July, in accordance with Article 396, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and attach a copy to be forwarded. This notice is hereby given. Right notice to Lu Genrong for information. A copy of the appeal brief is enclosed. July 7, 1930 [19th year of the Republic] Reasons for Appeal: Defendant Lu Genrong. The above defendant was declared not guilty by the Criminal Division of this court on June 30th of this year in the theft case. The prosecutor believes that an appeal should be filed and hereby presents the reasons as follows: The intent of the retrial in this case is twofold: first, whether Lu Genrong helped Huang Huiru commit theft before the act of theft was completed; and second, whether Lu Genrong transported the stolen goods after the act of theft was completed by Huang Huiru. After reviewing the entire file, although it cannot be proven how the defendant Lu Genrong helped Huang Huiru commit theft at the time of the theft, he cannot escape responsibility for transporting the stolen goods. The criminal act and criminal intent are discussed separately below: (A) Whether the defendant committed a criminal</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>act: According to Huang Huiru's testimony in the first instance, "The things were taken out in the afternoon of the 12th. Lu Genrong came out on the 12th," etc. It is clear that the stolen goods obtained by Huang Huiru were transported out by the defendant. Huang Huiru's testimony has been consistently exonerating the defendant. For example, Lu Genrong admitted during the investigation that he hired a car to pick her up, while Huang Huiru testified during the trial that the car was hired by Ama, etc. Only on this point did she inadvertently reveal the truth, which is the key evidence in this case. Moreover, during the investigation, when the prosecutor asked, "When your mother checked on the 12th, the jewelry box was already gone?" Huang Huiru testified, "He beat me because I said the jewelry box was gone," etc. It is clear that on the 12th, Huang Zhu's searched for the jewelry box and, finding it missing, severely reprimanded Huiru, which is consistent with Huang Huiru's statement that the things were taken out in the afternoon of the 12th, etc. The defendant Lu Genrong also admitted to the Public Security Bureau that "I took Miss Huang Huiru out with me and took away valuable ornaments." Comparing and cross-referencing this initial testimony with Huang Huiru's testimony above, it is undeniable that he implemented the transportation. Regarding his statement "and took away valuable ornaments," it is clear that the word "I" in Lu Genrong's statement is from himself. The original judgment said that it referred to Huang Huiru. According to the original testimony, the tone is obviously inconsistent. (B) Whether the defendant had criminal intent is discussed separately below. (1) Lu Genrong had a wife, which is an undisputed fact. His seduction of Huiru was not intended to lead to marriage. This alone is enough to prove that adultery was only for the purpose of obtaining wealth, which was his goal and the cause of the crime in this case. (2) Lu Genrong had Huang Huiru send the aforementioned Huiru to secretly transport the leather box out the day before the escape, which cannot be excused as unintentional. Considering that the things were transported out first on the 12th and then a car was hired to pick up people on the 13th, etc., when the prosecutor asked during the investigation where (one character missing in the original text) they met on the 13th, Lu Genrong replied, "I hired a car to pick her up." It is undeniable that they colluded with each other. Moreover, according to the defendant's statement at the Public Security Bureau that he took away valuable ornaments, he not only knew that there were ornaments hidden in the box, but also that they were valuable. Lu Genrong had been working as a tea servant at Huang Zhu's house for a long time and knew that Huiru was still unmarried and that her mother managed the family property. Suddenly, when they agreed to escape together, he had her transport the valuable ornaments out in advance, which shows that he was absconding with the property, and it cannot be said that he was unaware. (3) After Huang Huiru was seduced by Lu, they became completely corrupt, like a couple. Later, they moved back and forth between Suzhou and Shanghai, changing their residence frequently and spending the ornaments together. How could they not know the origin of these ornaments? By drawing an inference, it is possible to obtain a conviction. The original judgment did not thoroughly study the above points, which is not enough to form a conviction. In summary, the original judgment declaring the defendant not guilty is not appropriate. Therefore, an appeal is filed and it is requested that the original judgment be revoked and a sentence be imposed in accordance with Article 376, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. To the Supreme Court. Inspector Jin Henian of the Jiangsu Higher Court. July 6, 1930 [19th year of the Republic]</p>
<h3 id="e120">Another Madman Murders <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Lu Qiutao from Pusong District</p>
<p>Injures and Kills Multiple Men and Women</p>
<p>Lu Jinhua, a former resident of the West Market of Pusong Town, had four sons. The third son, Lu Qiutao, is forty years old. He has worked as a firewood carrier for many years. He is usually thrifty and his business is quite decent. Several years ago, he and his brothers built a large building, making them a moderately well-off family in the town. Unexpectedly, two years ago, Qiutao suffered some kind of mental shock and suddenly went insane. At first, he was still calm, but he stopped working and spent his days wandering the streets, muttering to himself, holding a donation register. He would talk about gods and Buddhas to acquaintances, asking them to solicit donations from the townspeople to build temples. Occasionally, he would become violent, and his family would chain him up for a few days, after which he would return to normal and resume his business as usual. However, he would relapse soon after. Last year, in February or March, when his madness struck, he would stay up all night, either scaring people like a ghost, or setting fire to fields where coffins were temporarily stored, or even setting fire to his own house or other people's houses. Fortunately, he was always seen in time, and no major disasters occurred. This time, he actually committed a major case of injuring and killing multiple people. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Destroying His Own Doors and Windows The Lu Qiutao household includes his brother, sister-in-law,</p>
<p>nephews, and nieces, as well as a wife and two daughters. They formed a small family, renting a house and</p>
<p>running a small grocery store. Before 4 PM on the sixth of this month, he was still working, selling rice straw to customers, showing no signs of madness. Unexpectedly, he suddenly went insane, holding a white-eye birdcage, slowly walking from the west of the store to his home. Upstairs, he smashed the doors, windows, and furniture in his house, yelling loudly. His brother and sister-in-law heard the commotion and, knowing that he was causing trouble, took sticks and other weapons to subdue him. Seeing this, the madman ran downstairs, grabbed a kitchen knife, and went out the door, still holding the birdcage, heading east. His brother and sister-in-law did not know he had a knife and paid little attention, not pursuing him, unaware that he was about to kill people.</p>
<p>Attacking a Mother and Son at a Blacksmith Shop The thatched cottage was a blacksmith shop owned by Ni Binggao. At the time, the entire Ni family was having dinner under the shed in front of the house. They saw Lu, holding a birdcage and walking quickly, not suspecting madness, paying no attention. Unexpectedly, as he approached, he took out the kitchen knife and slashed at the shop owner's wife's head, causing her to fall to the ground, bleeding profusely. The shop owner, Ni Binggao, and others all ran away in fear. However, his four-year-old son, unable to escape, was slashed four times, once on the eyebrow, once on the chest, and twice on the back, immediately falling to the ground.</p>
<p>Killing People Along the Way After injuring the mother and son at the blacksmith shop, the madman strode eastward, killing anyone he saw along the way. A bamboo shop owner named Xu, who lived nearby, ran wildly in front of the madman, shouting, "Lu Qiutao, the madman, is coming to kill people!" At this time, everyone was having dinner, and hearing the cries, they all fled in terror. The sound of footsteps and screams rose up, like a raging horse and crashing waves. The madman walked east to a noodle shop, where he encountered a country boy in his teens returning from the market with groceries. The madman slashed at him with the knife. The boy, terrified, fell. Fortunately, it was near the Xuehua River bank, and he fell and rolled down to the bank, avoiding injury.</p>
<p>Then Kills the Shop Owner and a Customer A lane to the east of the noodle shop</p>
<p>was the Shen Hengxing teahouse and grocery store. The shop owner, Shen Zi- , was handing money to a customer when the madman broke in from behind, taking him by surprise, and slashed at his neck. The shop owner, fearing his madness, did not resist and fled in pain. The madman wandered away, still holding the birdcage in his hand. He walked east to the Li Wanhe wine shop, where a man named Zhu was leaning against the counter, drinking wine and chatting with the shop assistant, enjoying himself. The madman lightly tapped Zhu's neck a few times with the back of the knife. Zhu looked back, not thinking he was crazy, paying no attention. The madman left, but after only a few dozen steps, he suddenly turned around and rushed at Zhu with the knife. Zhu, seeing the danger, reached out and grabbed the madman's wrist, holding it firmly, while shouting for help. The shop assistant and neighbors, seeing the situation was bad, rushed forward and snatched the knife from the madman. The knife was taken by a butcher named Yang. The madman then bit Yang hard on the back, injuring his skin and tearing his clothes.</p>
<p>The Murder Weapon is Seized and the Madman is Captured By this time, more and more neighbors were gathering.</p>
<p>The police also arrived. Although the madman's knife had been taken away, he was still very strong and punched and kicked, and those who were weak dared not approach. A police officer grabbed him from behind, but the madman bit off his little finger. A man named Wu was slapped in the face several times. Finally, a butcher's assistant named Li used all his strength and fighting skills to knock the madman down, and the police were able to hold him down on the ground, tie him up with rope, and carry him to the police station.</p>
<p>Muttering Nonsense Incessantly After the madman was detained at the First Precinct of the Sixth District, when Chief Wang interrogated him, he was still furious, glaring and muttering nonsense incessantly. He mostly refused to answer questions. When asked why he wanted to kill people, he replied, "I wanted to kill people myself. Now that you've put me here, I'm very happy and willing." He was completely unreasonable. Chief Wang, considering the matter involved a capital crime, sent him to the judicial section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<p>The Injured are Sent to the Hospital for Treatment Besides a certain police officer and the butcher, the blacksmith's wife had a wound on her head that was more than an inch deep and seemed quite serious. The four-year-old son's four wounds were not deep and probably wouldn't be fatal. The tea shop owner, Shen Ziqing, had a neck wound that was more than three inches long, but it didn't reach the skull. All were sent by police car to the Chinese Red Cross Society Hospital in Jing'an Temple for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Post Office Truck Driver's Suspected Suicide Cannot Be Confirmed <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Only the Disappearance Can Be Proven</p>
<p>Letter from China Merchants Bureau to Post Office</p>
<p>Regarding the disappearance of a truck driver surnamed Zhang from the Postal Administration, as reported earlier, some details have emerged. It is generally believed that he committed suicide by jumping into the sea. The information we have gathered is as follows:</p>
<p>Discovery of Jumping into the Sea The China Merchants Bureau's Xin Jiangtian轮 departed from Shanghai for Ningbo on July 2. A passenger was traveling to Ningbo. When the ship arrived in Zhenhai, the sky was still dim. The ship's steward discovered that a passenger was missing. After reporting to the purser, they went to the passenger's cabin and found two sets of clothes. After examination, they learned that it belonged to the truck driver who worked at the Shanghai Post Office. When the Xin Jiangtian returned to Shanghai, they sent the clothes to the post office for verification.</p>
<p>Clothes Sent for Confirmation After the ship returned to Shanghai, in addition to reporting to the General Bureau, the ship's purser sent two stewards with the missing driver's belongings to the post office to ask if they were his. At that time, the post office verified them and confirmed that they were indeed his. That was how they discovered he had disappeared. The post office then took the clothes.</p>
<p>Letter to the Bureau for Investigation Yesterday, the Postal Administration sent a letter to the China Merchants Bureau, asking if the crew of the Xin Jiangtian could confirm that the truck driver had indeed jumped into the sea and died. The China Merchants Bureau replied to the Post Office, generally based on the steward's report, only knowing that he had disappeared after arriving in Zhenhai. As for confirming that he jumped into the sea, since no one witnessed it, it was difficult to say for sure, and the reason was even more difficult to know.</p>

<p>An Indian Man Robbed and Shot</p>
<p>The Car Belongs to a Bank Comprador</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, between Weihaiwei Road and Chongqing Road, an Indian man was walking along the street when suddenly a covered car came up. A person jumped out of the car and snatched several dozen dollars of cash from the Indian man's chest. The Indian man tried to resist, but the person took out a pistol and shot him down. Passersby saw that the car's license plate was black, 10389, and it sped away. They reported to the police, who immediately sent the Indian man to the hospital for treatment. It is said that his injuries are very serious. The police found the car suspicious because it was driven away without authorization. They immediately notified all police stations to detain any car with license plate 10389. Around 8 PM last night, the car was found on Avenue Foch in Hongkou. The car and the suspect were taken to the Xinzha Police Station for further investigation. However, no clues were found. It is said that the car belongs to Cao Liang, a comprador at the Banque Industrielle de Chine in Shanghai, but the owner could not be found because he had a mistress elsewhere. The situation is quite strange. The police are investigating further to clarify the truth. The car with license plate 10389 is still at the police station.

<p>Yesterday morning around 10 AM, a young woman boarded ferry number 13 at the Customs Pier to cross the river. When the boat reached the middle of the river, the woman suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, the crew was quick and immediately rescued her, saving her life. The boatman Xu Maomao sent her to the Water Police Station. She said her name was Zhang Jinxian, 24 years old, from Changzhou. She married in her hometown at the age of 16. Soon after, her husband died of illness, leaving behind a five-year-old son. The widow and orphan found life very difficult. Her in-laws did not pity her for her widowhood. Two years ago, a friend of her late husband, Yang Dongshan, seduced her, claiming that it was not worth living such a lonely life at home, without any joy. He also said that he had bought a mahogany bed and other valuable furniture in Shanghai and was willing to live with her and grow old together, seeking the inherent happiness of life. She was temporarily deceived by his sweet words and took her son and the gold, silver, and clothes of considerable value from her home and ran away to Shanghai with Yang. When they arrived in Shanghai, the so-called mahogany bed turned out to be a broken bed made of three pieces of pine board. The other furnishings were also very simple. Being unfamiliar with the place and unable to call for help, she had no choice but to temporarily endure. They lived together for two years, but he had no regular job, and gradually all the gold, silver, and clothes she had brought were used up. They gradually had no food or clothing. She had no choice but to work as a servant in other people's homes. Seeing that she had no money to provide, Yang suddenly changed his kind and gentle face and accused her of having a new lover. Unable to argue effectively, he left on December 19th of last year and disappeared. She thought that when she had money, Yang was very affectionate, but when she had no money, he abandoned her as if she were trash. Such a conscienceless act was no different from the vicious tactics of a swindler. At that time, she temporarily moved to Gu Maolin's house at 127 Zhen'an Lane, Gonghe Road, Zhabei, and continued to work as a servant in the original place to make a living. Recently, she learned that Yang had a new rich woman and they were as close as glue, living in a small house somewhere. Yang's clothes were also extraordinarily luxurious, unlike his previous poor attire. She was heartbroken and increasingly depressed, leading to her feelings of world-weariness. She said, "The woman he's with will end up just like me when he spends all her money." She sobbed uncontrollably. The detective sympathized with her and advised her. He ordered the landlord Gu Maolin to be brought to the case and took her back.</p>

<p>The elderly woman Chen Chen, 59 years old, had a son who married a daughter-in-law. The daughter-in-law was exceptionally fierce. On the first of this month, the daughter-in-law had a major argument with Chen Chen over a trivial matter. Chen Chen angrily took poison. After her neighbors realized what had happened, they sent her to Tongren Hospital, then transferred her to Guangren Hospital. She recently died. Her son and daughter-in-law heard the news and fled in fear of punishment. The hospital notified the Harbin police, who sent detectives to move the body to the Pei Lun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, the Special District Court appointed Prosecutor Guo to the morgue to examine the body. According to the Western Deputy Detective, Luo Chen, who identified herself as the daughter of the deceased, said, "The deceased is my mother. I lived with my husband in Suzhou. After learning that my mother had taken poison, I rushed to Shanghai to see her, but she was already unable to speak. Now I will claim the body." Prosecutor Guo reviewed the testimony and said, "It is determined that the deceased female corpse, Chen Chen, died from opium poisoning. The corpse is handed over to the daughter, Luo Chen, to claim and bury."</p>
<p>Two Criminals Share a Car, Nose Broken, Arm Fractured, Leg Shattered</p>
<p>A Tram Smashes Into a Rickshaw</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Puller's Leg is Also Broken</p>
<p>The Haiyun Customs Brokerage firm sent a cargo ship loaded with broadcloth to the Qinhuangdao Road pier the other day to unload goods onto the Pinglong丸 vessel. Unexpectedly, four or five bandits, including Zhang A'er and Zhang Liangying, holding knives and axes, broke into the ship, threatened the sailors, and stole a box of broadcloth. The Customs Brokerage firm reported it to the Weituoma Road Water Police Station, who sent detectives Wang Haiquan and others to arrest Zhang A'er and Zhang Liangying. After a clear interrogation, at 10 AM yesterday, the detective was ordered to escort the two criminals to the District Court. The two criminals, handcuffed together, were sitting in a rickshaw. While traveling on the tracks on Chezhan Road in front of the District Court, a China Merchants Route 4 tram, traveling north, rang its bell to warn them, but the rickshaw puller ignored it, so the tram could not avoid hitting the rickshaw from behind. The rickshaw was smashed, and the rickshaw puller's leg was broken. Zhang A'er and Zhang Liangying were thrown from the car, their noses were broken, their arms fractured, and their legs shattered, all suffering serious injuries. The police arrived, recorded the tram as number 26 and the driver as number 81, and took the injured rickshaw puller to the Second District Police Station, ordering driver number 81 to report to the station. Zhang and the other criminal were first sent to the court for interrogation and detention, and then sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Public Works Bureau Restricts Rowing Boat Licenses <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau believes that rowing boats are of simple construction and can only travel on inland rivers. If they are on the Huangpu River, carrying passengers is often dangerous, and they cannot carry heavy loads. As they are without a fixed business and because the cost is very low, many unemployed and homeless people use them to engage in illegal activities, which has long been criticized by travelers on the Huangpu River, especially for transporting contraband, which endangers public security. The bureau's intention in registering, inspecting, and issuing licenses for these rowing boats is to gradually eliminate them. Therefore, it has consulted with the Finance Bureau to exempt them from taxes. The total number of registered rowing boats has reached 1,308. If restrictions are not imposed, they will continue to increase sharply, which will defeat the purpose of the ban. The 138th bureau meeting decided to stop registering rowing boats. From July onwards, only transfers and returns of licenses will be allowed, and no new licenses will be issued, to show restriction. The Municipal Government has approved this method.</p>

<p>The Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai is a group of Ningbo people in Shanghai. They are enthusiastic about starting charitable and public welfare matters on weekdays. Considering the large number of Ningbo natives in Shanghai, most of whom are poor, and once they get sick, it is difficult for them to see a doctor due to financial reasons, the 11th Executive Committee of the association decided to run a free clinic within the association to provide relief. It is reported that registered national doctors Jiang Zhuqing, Zhuang Yu, and Yu Daowei have been invited as medical directors, so that poor and sick fellow villagers who cannot afford medical treatment can receive free treatment. It is scheduled to start providing free treatment from the 16th of this month, and it is stipulated that the free treatment time will be from 10 AM to 3 PM every day.</p>
<h3 id="e133">A Dispute Over a Towel at a Public Swimming Pool <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Russian Detective Accuses Someone of Theft</p>
<p>Wang Caiqi is Imprisoned</p>
<p>The other day at dusk, there were Chinese and Western people bathing in the public swimming pool on Jiangwan Road. After bathing, Wang Caiqi, a Pudong native among the bathers, wiped his face with a large towel that belonged to a Russian named Qiulun in the neighboring room. Qiulun, who is a detective in the General Patrol Room, saw Wang taking his towel without permission and thought it was theft. He wanted to take him to the patrol room. When he was about to leave, Guan Bomin, an Anhui native also bathing there, thought it was a misunderstanding and that the Russian should not make a fuss over a small matter, so he stopped the Russian from performing his duties. As a result, there was a conflict between the two parties, and more and more onlookers gathered. Qiulun called the police, who took Wang and Guan, along with the towel, to the patrol room. Yesterday morning, they were taken to the Special District Court by Judge Feng Shide for trial. Qiulun testified that Wang stole his towel and was caught. Instead, he was robbed by Guan and others and wanted to be beaten. Wang Caiqi said that it was actually a misunderstanding and that he had been beaten by the Russian. Guan Bomin testified that he was only trying to dissuade them and was also punched and kicked by the Russian, who pointed a gun at him and called him a Communist. However, several Westerners who testified for Qiulun said that Qiulun did not hold a gun or beat anyone. Judge Feng said that the testimonies differed. He ordered Wang to be detained, Guan to pay 500 yuan bail, and asked for additional witnesses for another hearing.</p>

<p>Lu A'e, a woman from Shaoxing, 19 years old, with a slight appearance, has been an eldest daughter in the Bao family at 15 Jiani Lane, Avenue Edward VII, for five or six years. A few days ago, her mother in her hometown betrothed her to a small husband who was only 14 years old. She wrote a letter to her about it. Lu was very upset after hearing the news. She had been living in Shanghai for a long time, and she had heard and seen that men and women had absolute freedom in marriage. She did not want to marry this rural child. She suddenly became depressed. Although the employer tried to persuade her gently, A'e was still concerned about it, thinking that there was no hope for her lifelong happiness. At 10:30 AM yesterday, she secretly drank raw opium and committed suicide. The employer noticed it and accompanied her to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, she died around 5 PM that afternoon due to an overdose of poison.</p>

<p>Hu Ayou and Wu</p>
<p>Hu Ayou, a Ningbo native living at 38 Zhongyu Lane, Yongxing Road, Zhabei, who used to be a painter, went to the Ning'an Hotel at the end of North Zhejiang Road (Chinese Concession) with a young girl named Wu the night before last, and opened a room to stay overnight. Around 1:00 AM that night, the patrol chief of the First Precinct of the Fourth District went to the hotel to check on the guests. Seeing that Hu looked suspicious, he immediately took him to the precinct. Chief Yao interrogated Hu Ayou, who said he was 24 years old and Wu was his wife, whom he had married for many years. Wu said that she had married Hu last year. Chief Yao checked the records and, because their testimonies did not match, ordered them to be detained. Yesterday morning, a police officer was sent to the landlord at 38 Zhongyu Lane, Yongxing Road, to prove that Hu and Wu were officially married. They were then released, but they had been sitting in the police station all night, suffering a false alarm.</p>

<p>Lu Yueder, a native of Funing, Jiangbei, living at 57 Tianbao Road, Hujia Muqiao, Shanghai North, has been working as a rickshaw puller and has been married to Wei (also a native of Funing, currently 38 years old) for many years. Lu is short-tempered and disputes often arise between husband and wife. The day before yesterday, he argued with Wei over a trivial matter, and then grabbed Wei and beat her. Wei became angry and developed a feeling of world-weariness. That night, she took off her belt and hanged herself in the room. By the time Lu realized it, she was already cold as ice, and there was no way to revive her. He immediately reported it to the Third Precinct of the Fifth District, who ordered a guarantor to report it to the District Court. Yesterday afternoon, a prosecutor was sent to the scene to determine that the husband was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial pending verification.</p>

<p>Song Zhou Attempts Suicide by Hanging and is Rescued</p>
<p>Song Caijin, a Ningbo native, 35 years old, rented a house at 35 Zhuhang Lane, Nanshi. Ten years ago, he married a Zhou woman from the same hometown through a matchmaker. Zhou is now 27 years old. After she passed through the door, the couple suddenly had different opinions, and their relationship deteriorated day by day. His aunt, Wang, 61 years old this year, is violent. Neighbors call her a tigress. She often disliked that Zhou had been married for many years and had not yet given birth, so she often abused her. Zhou could not bear the pain, but because she respected her mother-in-law, she could do nothing but complain to herself. Unexpectedly, yesterday, Wang started a quarrel with her daughter-in-law Zhou over a trivial matter and beat her again, saying that it would be better for her to die sooner. Zhou was extremely angry and resentful after hearing this bad remark. She secretly went into the bedroom, took off her belt and hanged herself. Fortunately, she was discovered in time and rescued. The neighbors heard about it and were indignant. They immediately reported it to Zhu Xuanliang, the sentinel of the Eighth Guard Post there, who took Song Wang and her son to the General Bureau of the First District, where they were ordered to be temporarily detained pending a preliminary hearing.</p>

<p>All Three Bandits Were Extremely Cruel</p>
<p>Even After Receiving Ransom, They Still Tore Up the Ticket</p>
<p>The three bandits from Anhui, He Debin (aka He Peilin), Hu Mingzhao, and Li Jingming, etc., kidnapped Zhan Jiapeng, the uncle of merchant Zhan Fugao from Rendefang, Dongcheng in their hometown of Guangde County, Anhui Province, during the twelfth lunar month of last year. They sent a letter to the victim's family, demanding a ransom of 200,000 [monetary units] for his release. The victim's family sent someone to negotiate with the bandits and agreed to pay a ransom of 8,000 [monetary units], with 4,000 [monetary units] paid upfront. Unexpectedly, after receiving the ransom, the bandits tore up the ticket and buried the body in the wilderness outside the western city, destroying the evidence. The local government issued an arrest warrant. The bandits then fled to Shanghai, hiding in a shoe store on Avenue Edward VII. The Guangde County government learned of their whereabouts and sent detectives Chen Yuankai, Jin Yongxin, and Zeng Ronghua to Shanghai with official documents. They reported to the French Concession Police, requesting assistance in arresting the suspects. Police Inspector Jin Jiulin and Detective Qian Yumin were dispatched to assist in locating the address. The three bandits were arrested and taken to the police station. Yesterday, they were brought to the French Concession Court for questioning. The visiting detectives presented the official documents, stating the case and requesting permission to extradite the three defendants for trial. He Debin, Hu Mingzhao, and Li Jingming confessed directly to the kidnapping of Zhan Jiapeng and tearing up the ticket after the ransom was not fully paid. Judge Zhu ruled that since the defendants had confessed, they should be handed over to the visiting detectives for trial in their original jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Gambling Away Received Funds</p>
<p>Making Excuses to Evade Responsibility</p>
<p>Recently, the Hongkou Police Station has received several false reports of robberies. Upon investigation, it was found that the perpetrators were shop assistants who had collected payments and then gambled them away, unable to account for the missing funds. They resorted to this tactic to try to deceive their employers. Although detectives have investigated and sent those who made false reports to court for punishment, such incidents continue to occur. The police station is expending considerable effort on these cases. At 10 PM the night before last, a Ningbo native named Zhang Longhua reported to the police station, claiming that he was a runner for the Yongmao Hat Company in the French Concession. He had been ordered to collect payments from various merchants, amounting to over 30 [monetary units]. At 5 PM, while passing Taoyuanfang on North Jiangxi Road, he was suddenly accosted by two robbers. One robber brandished a gun, threatening him and taking all the money from his person. Therefore, he came to report the incident. The police chief found it suspicious that Zhang reported the robbery five hours after it occurred. He ordered Chinese Detective Sun Dehui and a Western detective to investigate the scene of the alleged robbery. They found no evidence of a robbery. They returned to the police station and detained Zhang. Under questioning, Zhang confessed that he had gambled away the collected funds and, unable to face his employer, had made a false report, asking for leniency. The police chief verified the confession and ordered him to be detained, awaiting transfer to the Special District Court for severe punishment to serve as a warning to others.</p>

<p>The mother of Zhang Miaolin, a villager from Pudong, who lived at 376 Avenue du Roi Albert in the French Concession, passed away on the 5th. Zhang received the news in the countryside and brought his six-year-old son, Zhang Fugen, to Shanghai for the funeral arrangements. That evening, the father and son were cooling off in front of their door. Fugen was running and playing in the road with neighboring children. At 8:45 PM, a car, license number 10258, driven by Huang Peilin, a chauffeur from a car company at 72 Guangxi Road, was traveling south and failed to avoid Fugen, hitting him. The police arrived and took both parties to the police station. The police chief ordered Huang to post bail and instructed that the injured child be sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of the injuries, the child died before treatment could be administered. The hospital notified the police station, which transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuantang morgue for examination. Yesterday, the Vehicle Affairs Office summoned the family of the deceased and the defendant to the scene. Judge Zhu of the French Concession Court arrived to examine the body. After taking his seat, he questioned the defendant and then ruled that the deceased boy, Fugen, had died from injuries sustained after being hit by a car. The family of the deceased should prepare a coffin for burial, and the police station should take photos of the body for record-keeping, pending further review.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor of Shenbao,</p>
<p>Having read yesterday's report in your newspaper regarding the death of Mr. Cheng Pu's wife due to an abortion, the statement "the plaintiff, along with the deceased's nephew Cheng Yanqing and witness Lu Baofa, testified in court about the events" seems to be a misunderstanding. After investigating, the deceased had invited me for a consultation on June 11th. At that time, I saw that her condition was serious and believed that she needed to be admitted to a hospital. Therefore, at the patient's request, I introduced her to Dr. Bu at Dahu Hospital for treatment. The patient had not mentioned any abortion history to me before. I also had no knowledge of her condition after she went to Dahu Hospital. Therefore, when I was summoned to court for questioning, I only mentioned that the deceased had once invited me for a consultation and was not a witness to her death due to an abortion. Therefore, I am making this special statement, hoping to publish this letter in your newspaper to dispel any misunderstandings. Respectfully yours, Lu Baofa, July 7th.</p>
<p>Respectfully, it is now reported that Jingqin Textile Factory claims to have seen a news item in the Shenbao of July 6, "Textile Factory Suspected of Arson for Compensation," which is surprising. On the afternoon of June 29, approximately 6 PM, smoke was discovered in the factory. Cotton blankets and paper were found under a bed in the workers' dormitory. As the factory manager was away at the time, besides temporarily storing the discovered items in the accounting room, no action could be taken. The next day, after the manager returned to the factory, he investigated again and found nothing. He immediately reported the information to the Gaocang Temple Second District Police Station, which forwarded it to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. It is not difficult to uncover the truth. This is the process. According to the news, the factory has three branch factories, and all have received compensation due to fires, which is entirely untrue. The factory has no branches, which can be investigated. Also, two fires within a year are not true. It is believed that this is a plot by malicious people. As the inaccurate information concerns the factory's reputation, we especially request your paper to allow our representative to notify the newspaper for correction. Respectfully to the Editor of Shenbao, Lawyer Wang Zhengqi, July 7th.</p>

<p>Utilizing X-rays</p>
<p>According to the Japanese News, Kato Toshio, assistant at the Physics Therapy Department of Keio University Hospital, has now completed the invention of artificially coloring crystals. Mr. Kato, 29, graduated from the Medical University two years ago and has been specializing in Roentgen therapy. Since last winter, he has been working at the Yamanashi Prefectural Hospital in Kofu. By taking colorless crystals from the prefecture and using the strong penetrating power of X-rays, he can achieve various colors and add more refined colors to natural colored crystals. According to him, he has now achieved great success in using X-ray radiation for 10 to 30 hours. Larger crystals up to three inches in diameter are also suitable, and he is currently researching further. Crystals from the Ural Mountains and the State of Bahia in Brazil are suitable for coloring, while crystals from Mt. Kinpu cannot be colored.</p>

<p>Riga (Latvia) News: Since sending two warships to the Black Sea in May, the Soviet government has continued to arm itself rapidly in order to regain hegemony in the Baltic Sea. The 26,000-ton dreadnought "Frunze" being built in Petrograd, with all its equipment being new, has 12 large guns and has recently been completed. Construction has also begun on four 900-ton submarines, costing 14 million [monetary units] in silver dollars. The Soviet Navy now controls the Baltic Sea again. Its naval strength includes three 26,000-ton dreadnoughts with a total of 36 guns, one cruiser (Aurora), 32 destroyers, and 10 submarines. Its fighting power exceeds the total strength of the warships of all Baltic Sea countries. Soviet naval officials claim that the Red Fleet can prevent any powerful nation's fleet from invading the Baltic Sea through the Danish straits when necessary.</p>
<p>Japanese Trade with China Gradually Returns to Normal</p>
<h3 id="e153">Cargo Loaded on Japanese Ships Increases Gradually Week by Week <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>According to the Eastern Newspaper, since the beginning of June, due to the sharp drop in silver prices, trade with China has been hit hard, with shipments temporarily decreasing by about two-thirds. Observing the trade between Osaka and Shanghai in terms of volume, it was extremely sluggish in the early and mid-June, with cargo loading only reaching about one-third of normal levels. After mid-month, the Sino-Japanese exchange rate stabilized slightly.</p>
<p>Starting from the 17th and 18th, it gradually increased. For example, the Osaka loading volume of Nippon Yusen ships was only about 500-600 tons per ship before mid-month. The Ikoma Maru, departing on the 18th, carried about 1,100 tons, almost doubling. Subsequently, the Kasagi Maru on the 21st carried 1,000 tons, the Aso Maru on the 25th carried 1,000 tons, and the Tenyo Maru on the 26th carried 1,300 tons. The Yayo Maru, departing at the end of the month, is currently loading, and the numbers are not yet clear, but it is predicted to be about 1,200-1,300 tons. Separated by weeks, it was 1,400 tons in the first week, 3,000 tons in the middle week, and 4,500 tons in the last week, totaling 8,500 tons, gradually increasing week by week, an increase of about 60% compared to the initial forecast of 5,000-6,000 tons. Observing its exports in terms of content, winter cotton fabrics have increased significantly, showing a changing trend in the season. Although silver prices are still soft, trade with China has gradually returned to normal, because the auction items in Japan are currently being shipped to China, and the low silver prices and falling prices of products shipped by ships are enough to offset each other.</p>
<p>Spanish Fabrics Switch to Japanese Silk</p>
<h3 id="e154">Chinese Silk Will Lose a Customer <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Our country's tea and silk foreign trade is being taken over by the Japanese year by year, and the trend is becoming increasingly sluggish. According to Japanese News, Japanese raw silk has traditionally been sold exclusively to the United States, with only about 10% sold in Europe, showing a declining trend year by year. Recently, the Spanish Baucelo Norway manufacturing company has been using Chinese and French silk. Now, because Japanese silk has durability and the fabrics are strong, it has recently purchased Japanese silk. Thus, Chinese silk will lose another sales channel to Europe.</p>

The original manuscript is approximately 3,000 pages long, and the commentary is all in Chinese. It will take another three years to publish. It is a masterpiece worthy of special mention in the history of Chinese literature research in Japan.</p>
