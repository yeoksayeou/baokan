<h3>一得之言</h3>
<p>— 蔣惠衫</p>
<p>社會上流行一種批評人的毛病以事不關已的口吻説某君辦事不力某君出言荒謬一旦臨到自已頭上來做似乎倒也走進［辦事不力］和［出言荒謬］的路上去了</p>
<p>兩性間的愛情在未成熟的時候覺得十分甜蜜一經到了成熟反而有些説不出來的痛苦</p>
<p>人而不貪便可稱廉然養廉之道又莫貴乎節儉今人貪而不能廉者均由於未能節儉</p>
<p>旁人的短處和隠事我不可在茶寮酒肆中作爲談話的資料</p>
<p>最使人討厭不過的是以一已之長逢人矜誇</p>
<p>一個人窮窮在内裏不可窮現於色道德不可窮行爲不可窮品格不可窮</p>
<p>没有眞學問的人最喜用僥倖心做事結果絕不會有美滿的收穫</p>
<p>書愈讀得多思想愈高超進一步説讀書是除愚昧的良法</p>
<p>凡遇極難之事以不畏難而求自助的精神做去總可得到相當的效率</p>

<h3>秋凉後之蕪湖電影</h3>
<p>— 成言</p>
<p>秋凉以後蕪湖之電影院如春筍之怒發頓見活躍舊有之明星蕪湖靑年會復活之國民新張之廣寒宫先後競以佳片號召但以歷史及駐滬選片者之關係後三者究不敵前二者茲略紀最近各院之情况俾知蕪湖秋來正多娛樂之地焉</p>
<p>明星　自大加改良以後開幕已二月餘經理汪耀侯委選片全權於副理于定勛君于君更請周劍雲徐欣夫二君爲滬上之選片人以周徐之魄力於是［明星］［上海］［大中華百合］諸著名公司之片乃悉在羅致之列最近如［紅蓮寺］［妹妹我愛你］諸片莫不滿座近聞更有計劃開映有聲電影片之説（其預定之第一片爲明星［歌女紅牡丹］）是以蕪湖各電影院之魔力似以［明星］爲最盛</p>
<p>蕪湖　駐滬選片係揚子江公司中西片兼映西片以滑稽爲主並加中文説明蓋否則無人顧問也如一年前在上海開映之深宫奪美此時竟能售七八成座中國片則因滬上諸大影片公司各片爲明星捷足先登乃不得不退而求其次矣</p>
<p>靑年會　並非完全營業性質（會員娛樂關係）故因陋就簡放映機亦祗一架以白壁代銀幕專演天一影片公司出品因價格之便宜亦有一部分能力</p>
<p>廣寒宫　係最近開幕者但建築殊草率放映機與［明星］同亦係兩架但光線似較弱映片皆國産惟因有［明星］［蕪湖］在前故不得不更求其次矣</p>
<p>國民　用銀幕而不用白布且有派拉通音樂是其特點關門久之近有不日開幕訊但放映國産片當然只能求次之更次者故聞有專映西片之議成績如何尚無把握然而間映西片之［蕪湖］此後國片西片乃受［明星］［國民］兩家勁敵之影響矣</p>

<h3>北遊印象</h3>
<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>（十七）歌者</p>
<p>「今天每塲休息的時間有俄國歌者表演呢」老謝告訴我這個消息</p>
<p>這的確是一位歌者秃的頭微笑的面孔黄色的緣邊的上衣腰間繫着彩色的絲帶外面再加着一件花的馬甲紅的燈籠袴脚上穿着花的短靴靴頭尖而向上捲起</p>
<p>當他邁着大步搖着右手左手夾着三角形的琴走出台口的時候那確像電影裏的道格拉斯只是他身材短了些</p>
<p>在座上歡迎的掌聲停止了以後伴奏的比牙落響了於是歌者撫着三絃琴開始彈動了絃子</p>
<p>這三絃琴許是俄國所特有的樂器（？）當我看了這位歌者彈了以後知道這樂器的彈法特殊的浪漫整個右手的五根手指同時向絃上彈撥起初他歌者是輕輕的顫動着絃一忽忽然瘋狂地顚亂地神經地全個右手在絃上奔旋有如狂風暴雨有如獸爭有如巨火有如羣衆的狂熱的呌喊忽然他將右手使勁地技巧地往上一甩熱亂的聲音驟止了接着從他口内發出宏喨的聲音痙彎地他用俄語唱着除了我能聽出他聲調的高低與急徐外不懂他是唱的什麽意思</p>
<p>在唱歌中還帶着口哨的技巧我也不懂是什麽意思在一段歌聲唱止之後觀衆所注意的又集中在他技巧的三絃琴的彈奏</p>
<p>完了他對台下行了一個中世紀英雄式的禮預備進後台去但觀衆的連續的掌聲留住着他他微笑地仍回到原來來的地位</p>
<p>「餑餑粒去開餑餑粒去開」（一種圓圈形的食品的俄語譯音）從座上的觀衆中有這樣的喊聲發出</p>
<p>「餑餑粒去開」於是他微笑地重安一安絃開始彈唱這他所特長的「餑餑粒去開」</p>
<p>聽他們説「餑餑粒去開」這齣歌曲在哈爾濱是很風行的這歌曲的産生在哈爾濱大概就是俄羅斯大革命以後的事吧這歌辭是描寫一個貧女孩在街上喊買餑餑粒去開她説「餑餑粒去開餑餑粒去開快來買我的餑餑粒去開吧不然熱的餑餑粒去開要冷了我的小肚皮要餓了」</p>
<p>這位歌者將三段「餑餑粒去開」唱奏完了之後觀衆們仍就要留住他但是幕已經落下了</p>
<p>據老謝告訴我這位歌者在哈爾濱是很有名的三絃琴家但他的吉逹兒也奏得很好可惜我記不住他那難説的如其他俄國人的一樣難説的他的名字</p>
<h3>箴言</h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>靑年們應切記住</p>
<p>莊嚴隆重的復大念五周紀念典禮在十七日下午二時開幕於廣大的體育館爆竹聲聲盛閙一時到會者有本校創辦人馬湘伯先生校長李登輝先生暨各來賓各記者本校全體敎職員同學等都凡五千餘人體育館中幾無空𨻶之地馬湘伯先生致開會詞李校長報告語中多是誠摰歡幸有以希望復旦鼓勵復旦最使我感到奮興的就是于右任先生那一大篇沉摰的演説詞句句都似珠玉宛然是靑年們的座右銘在下不敢自私一借「靑年園地」的寳貴篇幅貢獻給大家誠然這値得靑年們敬崇的箴言是應該深深地切記着的于先生的演説詞是這樣</p>
<p>諸位同學同志今天是本校二十五週年紀念并贈給兄弟及數位舊同學的學位全校充滿着很快樂的空氣兄弟亦覺得甚爲欣慰復旦比中華民國還大六歲有如中華民國的哥哥一樣本校是國内唯一獨立的學校回顧在民國以前反對宗敎敎育的只有復旦故復旦成立的歷史極燦爛的爲什麽呌做復旦呢馬湘伯先生剛才説得很清楚復旦的命名有很深長的意義在其中在漫漫的長夜浸成「復旦」使宇宙大放光明還有一點日月光華旦復旦兮的謳歌是我國五千年前的事其意思就是指由日月的旋轉不息於是才有旦復旦的到來日月由光華而再進於光華由復旦而再進於復旦誠屬可喜的事馬湘伯先生對復旦的歷史最爲詳悉當時震旦受壓迫的靑年受了很多痛苦憤而離校在同學會開會决意建設一個學校這個時補舉出幾個同學負建校之責有二位很努力的人今已出世不及看今日的盛典殊堪惋惜這兩位作古的人希望同學永遠不要忘記最初的時候校址就在南洋路後移至吳淞此時有如馬先生所説學校中連幾張檯子都没有後來緩緩設法充實民國元年移到徐家匯的李家祠有許多人不贊成但我則竭力主張結果終於在李公祠一天一天的發逹那時我因有旁的事情就離開本校了至於我對於學位的感想就發生了許多記得從前我在家鄉時完全没有讀書的機會後來飄流至上海逢馬湘伯先生才由馬先生介紹至震旦當那個時候異鄉漂泊一切希望都灰遑論學士博士學位過了幾年就到外面奔走國事學問日形荒廢現在本校一天比一天發逹但老同學的學問則一天比一天退步基於這一點感想我就很希望諸位靑年的同學們努力求學前十幾年我奔走國事至今日覺得國家的貢獻不過幾千分之一而學問的荒蕪則一天一天的退化諸位到年紀大一點才知此話不差靑年求學時代應該確認一個標準而對這個標準出發才好復旦在今日差不多已成功爲國内第一流的私立大學許多私立大學俱以復旦爲很好的榜樣以後諸位萬不要忘記復旦是專靠學生的書金維持所以我們學校的發逹亦唯全體同學是頼使復旦造成很多的人才造福於國家社會這便是我們同學的責任杜紹文君筆錄</p>
<p>我們讀了上面所徵引的于先生底演説詞無疑地是可引起無限的感想第一於于先生在幼小時候的求學是多麽的艱苦漂泊異鄉作客又是多麽的茫茫無依最後得到馬先生的臂助始能夠進震旦攻讀第二于先生愛護母校的心是如何的熱忱將母校比做中華民國的哥哥這當然是有深沉的意義的第三于先生熱愛國家之心比愛護母校的心更爲深摰自離開了復旦之後就到外面奔走國事一直到現今仍不稍些休息同時仍念念不忘於「學問」在奔走國事中感到學問荒廢可惜的惜實際像于先生這樣的才望足夠獻身於國家社會之用但是于先生還刻刻想在學問上做一番功夫這種愛校愛國和愛學的精神使我們一般終日不學無術的靑年大學生或者中學生見了是如何的慚愧非下一番克勤克儉的求學工夫而不足報答切望我們有所成就的人如果祗圖游蕩對於功課敷衍過去將父母從困苦中掙下來的金錢儘量揮霍一點也不曉得愛惜結果學問仍無所成這眞個連自已都對不住聽了于先生的「針針見血」之語我想至少要回過頭來對於學問方面努力一下第四于先生自已是替國家努力但是總不忘記我們一般後輩靑年看于先生最後的幾句話是對我們負起多麽期望的心我很希望現在一般在學的靑年不要辜負于先生一番熱忱的期望</p>
<p>這不過是關於于先生的演説詞箴言一點感想而已至於復旦此次的贈送名譽學位我也稍些有點意見</p>
<p>復旦這次的贈送博士與學士學位當然是有深刻的意義即像于先生這樣對於母校的愛護替國家的盡力社會上的貢獻是誰也知道而且景仰着的無論在學問上地位上都有贈送博士學位的必要其他如本校校董現任國民黨中央監察委員的邵力子先生本校校董現任浙江財政廳長的錢新之先生贈送學士學位的如以擅長藝術著稱國内外現任上海市黨部監察委員的朱應鵬先生在本校服務二十年現任校長秘書的季英伯先生其他七位受學位的均在社會上所有貢獻所以復旦這次的贈送學位在事前是有嚴重的考慮而且含有偉大的意義私立大學中可以算是放一光榮的異彩這是大家都已瞭然的吧</p>

<h3>鄕心</h3>
<p>— 紹琦</p>
<p>「明日十月十日國慶紀念本校休假一天此佈]</p>
<p>佈告箱前面圍了一大堆同學們伸長了頭頸各人臉上露着笑容見了一年一度的國慶紀念大家興高采烈地爲了烈士門犧牲頭顱熱血換來的紀念日照例有一天假期本來學生在學校裏上了幾天課就喜歡放假</p>
<p>下午没有課有些同學們忙着整理行裝本埠的同學等不到明天的假期就回家去蕙説「你常患着Ｈome　sick明天放假了你總回去吧」</p>
<p>「等不到明天」我正把單衣放入皮包内這樣回答她</p>
<p>「今天就走嗎」</p>
<p>「是的立刻就要動身了還趕得到火車我已寫信給母親」</p>
<p>蕙向我微微地笑着「哈像小孩子般的這樣性急還要投到母親懐抱裏去發嬌吧」</p>
<p>「…」我把皮包整理好了</p>
<p>離别了没有許久的家鄕一切景象還是和從前一樣略微帶些寒意的微風輕輕地迎了我飄着落葉受不住風的動力奏着沙沙地曲淡黃色的太陽慢慢向西了柔和的光線一切的一切都好似歡迎我回來母親已等在門口望着啊我眞想立刻撲向她的懷裏受她的溫存撫慰</p>
<p>短促的假期轉瞬就過去了並且還多住兩天這是國慶假期後到校的第一夜鐺鐺的寢鐘聲在靜寂空氣中震盪黑暗之神掌管了全校宿舍校長也太熟讀經濟學了就是走廊内幾盞半明不滅的路燈也要熄滅從窗隙裏飛來料峭的北風並且毛毛小雨洒濕了窗簾同室們發出若斷若續的鼾聲凄凉的深夜震動了弱小的心靈游子的心弦怎能不彈出思鄕之曲</p>
<p>時間之輪若能反轉回到昨晚的現在那是何等的愉快肥大的蟹堆了一桌一家人圍坐了吃</p>
<p>「這幾隻頂大的讓姊姊吃她明天就要到校了你們在家裏常常可以吃的」母親的臉上充滿了慈祥的神氣望着弟妹們説</p>
<p>「姊姊明天你眞的要去了麽還可以等一天嗎我們校裏明天有游藝會我還做戲哩你不要去來看好嗎」弟弟接着問我烏黑而有光彩的眼球内滿貯着希望</p>
<p>「校中缺了許多功課再也不能遲延了明天總得要去」我回答他説</p>
<p>各人都靜默着只有剝蟹的聲音衝破寂寞的空氣弟弟鼓起了嘴向我呆望着大槪不滿意我的答覆吧晚飯後我抱着小妹妹在燈光下踱了一會就坐下了她今夜格外依戀我弟弟牽着我的手問我是否到年假才回來二妹要我到校後就寫信給她母親吩付阿菊代我預備些食物帶到校裏父親啣着捲烟踱來踱去呌我在外交友謹愼些</p>
<p>「你們别多説了姊姊明天要起早讓她早些睡吧」母親對弟妹們説</p>
<p>弟弟和二妹小妹妹同聲向母親説「明天我們也要起早送姊姊到上海去」回頭呌阿菊「明天早上呌我們一聲」</p>
<p>她們天眞流露的誠懇啊我怎的日常不感覺得</p>
<p>在晨光熹微中我離别了甜蜜的家庭回到學校做日出而作日入而息的工作太機械式吧敎師憑着私見同學懷着嫉妒背鄕離井的游子忍受了吧人離别家鄕爲甚呢可愛的家鄕我不願再離别你了永久投在母親的懷裏懦弱的人怎能遠離父母</p>
<p>風聲不住的吹雨格外下得大了深沈的回憶結成了思家之網眷眷懷歸怎能入夢</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Machines Usurping Manual Labor</h3>
<p>I have repeatedly said that the root cause of the world's unemployment problem lies in the excessive progress of machinery. The progress of machinery is intended to promote the prosperity of commerce. The principle of commerce is to produce a large quantity of goods at a low cost. Low cost makes sales easier, and large quantities make the goods more popular. However, the only way to achieve low cost and large quantities is through the power of machinery. The more advanced the machinery, the less manual labor is needed, and the more output is produced. The less manual labor is needed, the more people become unemployed. The more output is produced, the more goods in the marketplace are oversupplied, which further lowers the price of goods and weakens commerce. Therefore, machinery, which was initially a tool to promote the prosperity of commerce, is now a tool to destroy commerce and cause it to decline. If the world's industrial and commercial nations do not pay attention to this, commerce will never recover, and the unemployment problem will never be solved. Today, the US authorities also have this view. According to Mr. Hu, the Director General of the Unemployment Relief Association, the rapid pace of new machinery inventions is alarming. For example, the invention of a certain machine can replace the labor of 8,000 coachmen, and another machine can replace hundreds of workers with the power of one person. Therefore, if we want to permanently eliminate the tragedy of unemployment, this issue must be resolved first. Furthermore, according to the calculations of Labor Minister Dai, the number of workers in the United States displaced by machinery has reached more than 2 million. In addition, various important figures in the US authorities have made similar statements, believing that one of the most important issues to be addressed in the current state of affairs is this.</p>

<p>Germany and Russia</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Relations Increasingly Cold</h3>
<p>No Need for Cooperation in Economic and Military Matters. Russia's New Economic Policy Clashes with German Industry. Famous French Reporter Suggests Concluding a Franco-German Military Alliance. Berlin News: After Germany and Russia signed the Treaty of Rapallo in 1922, it was generally predicted that the friendship between the two countries would become more friendly and intimate. Unexpectedly, the result was the opposite. To this day, German-Russian diplomatic relations can be described as extremely cold. German industry and finance are unwilling to allow the government to provide too generous credit exports to Russia, thereby taking risks. The German-Russian military alliance, which was vigorously promoted several years ago to restore Germany's power on the European continent, is now silent and regarded as a historical joke. The red imperialist policy of aggression of the Soviet Union has been thoroughly understood by Germany. If the German and Russian armies were to jointly resist France and Poland, the red Russian army, after crossing the Polish border and joining forces with the German army to confront France on the Rhine, would permanently reside in German territory regardless of whether the war against France was won or lost, and would never return to its homeland. Germany would involuntarily become a Soviet state. Therefore, German newspapers and general public opinion no longer advocate a German-Russian military alliance. The Morning Post once made an editorial on this, stating that although Germany's current situation is extremely difficult, it is still better than Russia under the Soviet system. Therefore, Germany's future movement to amend its eastern border and the Polish Corridor will be carried out peacefully, and it is not advisable to start a war. From an economic point of view, the hopes of German leaders on the Soviet Union have also been shattered. Many industrialists, economists, and even government officials clearly recognize that although the Soviet Union has implemented the provisions of the Treaty of Rapallo in the past three years, it has failed to respect its spirit. For example, Article 5 stipulates that the economic needs of the two countries should be developed and supplied to each other in a spirit of mutual assistance. However, Stalin's internal and external policies have made it impossible to implement the provisions of that article. Furthermore, since the Soviet Union created the Five-Year New Economic Policy, it has regarded industrial Germany as its only major enemy and is extremely suspicious. It only knows how to export its domestic products to Germany to destroy German domestic industries, let alone take care of a piece of paper. Therefore, from a military and economic perspective, there is no need for cooperation between Russia and Germany, let alone the possibility of cooperation. This is why the friendship between the two countries has become increasingly cold. (World)</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 25th: French famous journalist and politician Heriot, through the introduction of German industrialist Reichsfuhrer, proposed to Germany to conclude a Franco-German military alliance with the following conditions: (1) Conditional cancellation of reparations; (2) Reducing the strength of the German army to equal strength; (3) Returning the former German colonies of Togo and Cameroon; and (4) France persuading Poland to return the Kurland region of Germany. Today, Hitler, the leader of the German National Socialist Party, replied to this proposal that what is the purpose of this alliance and against which country is it intended? France today should reduce its military preparations rather than induce Germany to expand its military preparations. Soldner, the leader of the national faction's Stahlhelm, refused to answer because he was unwilling to work with Reichsfuhrer. Hugenberg, the leader of the National Power Party, said that this is still an attempt by the old Entente powers to reach an incorrect solution with Germany.</p>

<h3>Machines Seizing Jobs</h3>
<p>The invention of machines is advancing rapidly. The unemployment problem is becoming increasingly serious. U.S. authorities are urgently considering prevention. Associated Press, Washington, 25th - Unemployment Relief Director, Mr. Hoover, announced today that once the current unemployment crisis is resolved, all central committees must begin to prevent future unemployment situations and pay attention to the problem of manual workers being displaced by newly invented machines. According to Mr. Hoover, recently machines have been invented so rapidly that it is astonishing. People's lives are almost entirely dependent on machines. For example, the invention of a certain machine can replace the labor of 8,000 coachmen, and another machine can replace hundreds of workers with the assistance of just one person; this is what is called a robot. Therefore, to permanently avoid the tragedy of unemployment, it is essential to address this problem as a matter of priority. According to Labor Secretary Davis' calculations, more than two million workers in the United States have been displaced by machines. Other government officials have made similar statements, all believing that the problem of machines seizing jobs is the most serious issue facing the country today.</p>

<h3>The Four Northwestern Provinces After the Defeat of Feng's Army</h3>
<p>Feng's Army Divided into Four Factions. Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia Oppose Feng. Northern China Correspondence. After the defeat of Feng's army, it has now disintegrated into four factions. Lu Zhonglin, Liu Ruming, Zheng Dazhang, and others form one faction, stationed north of the Yellow River in areas such as Huaiqing and Xinxiang. Song Zheyuan and Liu Yufen form one faction, stationed inside and outside Tongguan. Sun Lianzhong forms one faction, stationed at the junction of Henan and Hebei. The above three units are gradually beyond Feng's control. Those that Feng can control are only the 10,000 to 20,000 troops of Pang Bingxun, Sun Liangcheng, and Feng Zhi'an, who are now retreating into Hedong region in Shanxi Province. The reason why Feng's army did not return to Shaanxi and Gansu but retreated to Shanxi is that it is not allowed in reality. Gansu Province was divided into the three provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia the year before last. At that time, although the chairmen of the three provinces were all figures of the Feng faction, and on the surface it seemed that they all belonged to the Feng army's sphere of influence, in reality, the feudal forces of the Hui army and the latent power of the Hui people had not been eliminated. In addition, the relationship between the Feng faction and the Hui people was very bad, and disturbances continued. This spring, Feng transferred Ningxia Chairman Ji Hongchang to lead troops to Henan, and had no choice but to appoint Ma Hongbin as acting Ningxia Chairman (Hongbin is a cousin of Ma Fuxiang). Now, the entire Ningxia Province is completely controlled by Ma. Since the founding of the Republic of China, Qinghai has been the personal domain of Ma Qi, the garrison commander of Xining. This summer, Feng transferred Sun Lianzhong (who was the chairman of Qinghai Province at the time) to Henan, and Ma once again became the de facto chairman of Qinghai Province. In Gansu, Ma Lin had already become independent in Longdong, the former Ganliang circuit of Gansu. In the Weichuan circuit of Longxi, it is now occupied by Huang Degui. Huang Yuan, the brigade commander of the old Gansu Governor Lu Hongtao, took advantage of the large-scale southward transfer of Feng's army this year to gather old troops and local bandits, totaling 20,000 to 30,000 men, and occupied Lanzhou, the provincial capital of Gansu. Huang had sent people to contact the central government and had already been appointed as the commander of the Gansu Anti-Rebel Army. In addition, bandits of all sizes in Gansu are rising everywhere, attacking and occupying cities. Tianshui County, which is close to Shaanxi and is the gateway from Shaanxi to Gansu, has also fallen into the hands of bandits. Other situations can be imagined. Therefore, the three provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia have long ceased to belong to Feng. In Shaanxi, Liu Yufen, the provincial chairman appointed by Feng a month ago, was still stationed in Xi'an. At present, Liu has led a group of provincial government personnel to Tongguan. Although Xi'an has not been lost, it is also surrounded by bandits, including about one regiment of Feng's army. At the same time, Feng Yi'an, a former subordinate of Chen Shufan, gathered defeated soldiers in Hanzhong and occupied more than 20 counties, and advanced to Xianyang City, which is 40 miles from Xi'an. Feng Yi'an's troops now number 30,000 and have also been appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Shaanxi Anti-Rebel Army. In northern Shaanxi, Zhang Dingsheng has risen up and occupied more than ten counties. Zhang is a native of Shaanxi and a graduate of the Whampoa Military Academy, and has also been in contact with the central government. After Feng's army was defeated in Henan, Zhang immediately led his troops to actively advance towards the Datong-Huayin Road. Recently, he has advanced to the vicinity of Huayin. If Huayin is occupied, Liu Yufen in Tongguan and Xi'an will also have their rear cut off. Therefore, Liu and Song Zheyuan have already expressed their intention to retreat to Fenghuiling. Fenghuiling and Tongguan are only separated by the Yellow River. Liu's arrival at Fenghuiling should not be regarded as an invasion of Shanxi, but rather as a retreat, because there is no way to return and Yang's army is in front (Yang Hucheng's troops have already passed Hangu Pass). What other way is there other than entering Shanxi? Under such circumstances, the term "Northwest Army" that people have used for Feng's troops for many years should no longer exist. It is said that Liu Yufen and Song Zheyuan's troops have a good relationship with Feng. Feng hopes that these two units will merge with the Pang Bingxun and Sun Liangcheng units currently in Hedong to form a residual force. He has specially ordered Liu Ji to negotiate with Yan Xishan and ask him to treat Pang and Sun's troops equally.</p>
<h3>Recent Military News from Henan Province</h3>
<p>Zhengzhou Correspondence. Since the Central Army recaptured Zhengzhou on the 7th of this month, Feng's army has once again split. His direct descendant General Ji Hongchang and others have pledged allegiance to the Central Government and have been reorganized. Shi Yousan is entrenched in Xinxiang, Hebei, and is willing to be commanded by Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang. Miscellaneous troops such as Sun Dianying and Liu Guitang have been almost completely annihilated. No less than 50,000 to 60,000 of Feng's army were surrounded and disarmed by the Central Army in Xinzheng. More than two-thirds of all personnel, horses, guns, equipment, and supplies were lost. Luoyang and Shanzhou were successively recaptured. The remnants of the army, Song Zheyuan and Liu Yufen's troops, retreated towards Tongguan, while Zheng Dazhang and Sun Liangcheng's troops retreated towards southern Shanxi. The military situation on the Longhai and Pinghan Railways has come to an end. When Commander-in-Chief Chiang was in Zhengzhou, he believed that it was necessary to establish a commander-in-chief's headquarters in Zhengzhou to handle important matters such as post-war military affairs and pursuing the enemy. Therefore, he telegraphed He Yingqin, the head of the Wuhan headquarters, to come to Zhengzhou to preside over the headquarters' affairs. At present, most of the staff of the Wuhan headquarters have arrived in Zhengzhou one after another and have established the Zhengzhou headquarters in the old civilian engineering institute next to the railway station. The headquarters is divided into eight departments: Staff, Adjutant, Secretariat, Communications, Management, Military Law, Military Medicine, and Counselor. A small number of personnel remaining in Wuhan will also be telegraphed to come to Zhengzhou. It is reported that the Commander-in-Chief has also decided to organize a headquarters in Luoyang to command the pursuit troops, and Gu Zhutong has been appointed as the director of the headquarters. It is reported that Gu will go to Luoyang soon to organize the headquarters. At present, the remnants of Song Zheyuan and Liu Yufen are still entrenched in Lingbao and Tongguan. The Central pursuit troops have already passed Hangu Pass in Lingbao and are advancing towards Lingbao. As for Feng's troops Zheng Dazhang and Sun Liangcheng, they are at a loss and have escaped towards southern Shanxi from Yangwu and Huojia. According to recent air force reports, there are still about 4,000 to 5,000 enemy troops continuing to advance towards Jincheng, Shanxi, on the mountain road from Qinyang, Henan, to Jincheng, Shanxi. Their vanguard has reached Xiaoji Village. In addition, hundreds of enemy soldiers were also found on the highway west of the county seat, seemingly retreating towards Yangcheng. The Central Army pursuit troops are divided into five detachments, commanded by Jiang Dingwen, Yang Hucheng, Wang Jinyu, Liu Maoen, and Yue Weijun, and are pursuing in different directions. The 6th and 8th Aviation Squadrons have also dispatched Caudron fighter planes to Jincheng, Shanxi, and west of Lingbao to scout for the enemy's whereabouts. This morning at 9:00 a.m., Ji Hongchang, accompanied by Leng Xin, a counselor from the headquarters, flew to Nanjing in two Caudron aircraft to request instructions from the Commander-in-Chief on matters related to the reorganization of his troops and other important matters. Ji's troops are currently stationed in Luoshan, Guangshan, Huangchuan, and Shangcheng, and have been ordered to be responsible for clearing bandits in Henan. (October 21)</p>
<h3>Shanxi Province Currency Plummets</h3>
<p>Government-Operated Businesses First to Refuse Payment. Shops Freely Bargain for Goods. Northern China Correspondence. The Shanxi Provincial Bank's currency has recently plummeted due to the impact of military defeats. A gentleman who came to Beiping from Taiyuan yesterday said that the price of Jin currency has been declining recently. The government has been unable to maintain its value, and merchants are full of doubts. Although they do not dare to openly refuse it, discounts have become an open secret. It is difficult for those who hold a certain amount of paper money to exchange it for one silver dollar. The value of goods is only increasing day by day, which is shocking. Yesterday and today, the Zhengtai Railway Station, the Commercial Telegram Bureau, the Telephone Bureau, and the Post Office have all stopped accepting provincial currency and have switched to silver dollars. It has not been reported that the Telegram and Telephone Bureaus have experienced other disputes, but at the railway station, conflicts have arisen between the railway bureau and travelers over change (for example, the fare from Taiyuan to Yuci is 45 cents. If a traveler pays with a silver dollar, the railway bureau will give 55 cents in Jin currency). Since the railway station switched to silver dollars, only 18 tickets were sold for the two passenger trains on the morning and afternoon of the 14th. On the 15th, 12 tickets were sold for the train from Taiyuan to Yuci, and 4 tickets were sold for the train to Shijiazhuang. The railway bureau's income has therefore plummeted. When merchants and travelers arrive at the station, they do not have cash to buy tickets, so speculative merchants take this opportunity to use a small amount of silver dollars to buy paper tickets at the station. By the evening of the 15th, one silver dollar could be exchanged for five paper dollars at the station. As a result, there were people who only carried three or four paper dollars, which was not enough to buy tickets, and they cried loudly at the station. In the city of Taiyuan, merchants arbitrarily ask for prices for goods, with no fixed standard. The same goods are priced at three yuan by one person, five yuan by another, and ten yuan by a third. Such abnormal conditions have never been seen or heard of before. Although the Post Office has switched to silver dollars, there is still room for accommodation. If there is cash, they will pay with cash to buy tickets. If there is no cash, they can pay with provincial currency, but it costs 12 cents to mail a flat letter, which requires four cents in postage. Judging from the current situation, if all businesses rise up and switch to silver dollars, the lives of the people of Shanxi will face unprecedented panic. (October 19)</p>
<h3>He Jian Forcefully Explains to the Central Government</h3>
<p>Detailed Account of Suppressing Rebels and Bandits. Changsha Correspondence. Changsha has fallen twice this year, and the people have suffered deeply. In addition, after the ravages of war, the authorities have created the so-called post-war donation, in which donations are levied on houses, land, and operating capital using a progressive method. How can the disaster victims bear this? Therefore, people inside and outside Hunan Province have complaints about He Jian, who is in charge of Hunan's affairs. Recently, the "Dongting Wave Weekly" and the "Special Edition for Saving Hunan" published in Nanjing have strongly criticized He. There are also publications in Wuhan that attack He Jian. He Jian is very uneasy. Recently, because the Wuhan headquarters convened a meeting of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi to suppress bandits, He took a plane to Wuhan on the 22nd to attend the meeting and took the opportunity to explain everything to He Chengjun, asking him to forward his explanation to the central government. Before leaving, he also sent a long telegram, detailing the process of suppressing rebels and bandits over the past two years, strongly defending against the reported allegations of condoning bandits, covering up defeats and embellishing achievements, and embezzling military pay for personal gain. He also requested that the central government send senior officials to Hunan to thoroughly investigate and clarify the truth. The original telegram is recorded below: [Urgent. To the Central Party Headquarters of the Capital, Chairman Chiang of the National Government, Premier Song of the Executive Yuan, Deputy Commander Zhang of Shenyang, Director He of Zhengzhou, and Director He of Wuhan: In recent months, some Hunanese people in Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan have been gathering in the name of fellow villagers' associations, holding meetings, distributing leaflets, and reporting to the central government, sparing no effort to attack me. Recently, I read the "Dongting Wave" and the "Special Edition for Saving Hunan," which deplore the burning and killing of Hunanese people by the Communist bandits. The "Central Daily News" reprinted the various publications, which were especially critical. I have failed in my duties and have let down the central government's trust and the expectations of the people of Hunan. I was filled with grief and indignation when Changsha fell again. I telegraphed on the auspicious day of August to request severe punishment, and I dare not seek understanding while enduring humiliation and awaiting punishment. However, since the mutiny of the Gui faction in Wuhan, my army has been ordered to rush to the front and has entered Guangxi three times, fighting alone. After being exhausted, Zhang Fakui mutinied and fled westward. We fought fiercely for more than ten days, and then there was the mutiny of Tang Shengzhi's troops from Henan. Reactionary elements entered Hunan and incited trouble in the army, causing several nights of alarm. Fortunately, thanks to your authority, the mutinous troops were quickly annihilated. This spring, when Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang rebelled and the Gui faction suddenly rose up, my troops were far away on campaign in Quanzhou, with the remaining troops divided to defend Chaling, Youxian, Liling, Pingxiang, Liuyang, Pingnan, Hua'an, and Lixian, suppressing bandits and leaving troops in western Hunan to deter mutiny. The conscription had not yet been completed, and the troops were hastily mobilized to resist the rebels, who had launched a full-scale invasion, invading Zhuzhou and reaching the provincial capital. Fortunately, they were able to recover after being outflanked and attacked. The Central Army, Navy, and Air Force cooperated in the pursuit, and the rebels were annihilated in Hengyang and Qiyang. My army was then ordered to send a part of its troops to Guangxi and another part to pursue and suppress the remaining rebels between Qiyang, Xinxing, Dong'an, and Wugang. At that time, Communist bandits from western Jiangxi and southern Hubei gathered in Pingxiang and Liuyang. The various friendly armies had all opened up to the north. I ordered a small number of troops to advance and hold between Changning and Pingxiang. After six days and nights of bloody battles, with thousands of casualties, it was difficult to mobilize troops, and the number of bandits increased greatly, leading to the fall of the city on July 27. At that time, I was determined to die and had no strength to return. Although Changsha was recovered quickly, how could it atone for even one hundredth of my crime? Afterwards, I led my troops to Liuyang and captured and killed many bandits. However, because the bandits took advantage of the mountainous terrain and Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Huang Gonglue led more than 100,000 bandits to join forces and try to completely destroy my army, I had no choice but to lead the bandits out to fight in the suburbs, which was not my intention. This is the truth about my army's efforts to suppress rebels and bandits over the past two years. To call it condoning bandits is to confuse black and white. As for the request for assistance and equipment, the documents have been submitted. I am confident that I will be spared from being accused of covering up defeats and embellishing achievements. The military pay of my army is paid by the province, and the national tax is usually not enough to cover expenses. It is even more difficult during wartime. Moreover, the income and expenses are managed by special personnel sent by the central government and have been reported clearly in the past. How could I embezzle it for personal gain? Such slanderous rumors are confusing, or they are motivated by other purposes. I believe that the frequent national incidents over the years are due to the lack of discipline, and the lack of discipline is due to the lack of clarity about right and wrong. If I have indeed condoned bandits, covered up defeats, embellished achievements, and embezzled military pay for personal gain, it will not be difficult for the central government to thoroughly investigate and severely punish me to establish discipline. If the investigation reveals that it is a case of private vendetta and slander, then I will await punishment here. Although I am entrusted by the central government to guard against criticism and cultivate myself, the country should also have a system of sanctions for those who wantonly slander. Therefore, I do not avoid the axe and once again trouble your ears. I humbly ask you to examine and verify, conduct a thorough investigation, or quickly send senior officials to Hunan to thoroughly investigate and clarify the truth, and I will be waiting for orders with trepidation. To the Dongting Weekly in Nanjing, No. 20, Dafu, submitted jointly by He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army].</p>
<h3>Lu Diping Returns to Jiangxi from Wuhan</h3>
<p>The Outline for Suppressing Bandits in the Three Provinces Was Agreed Upon in Wuhan. Will Launch a General Offensive After Neighboring Provinces Have Deployed Properly. Nanchang Correspondence. Lu Diping, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Ninth Route Army, left the province on the 16th of this month to go to Beijing to participate in the relocation ceremony of the late President Tan Yankai's coffin and to pay respects to Commander-in-Chief Chiang. On the 21st, he and Liu Wendao, the mayor of Wuhan, took an airline plane from Beijing to Wuhan to discuss the plan for suppressing bandits in the three provinces with He Chengjun. At 8:30 a.m. on the 24th, he took a Caudron plane from the first aviation team back to Jiangxi and landed at Yonghe Airfield in Nanchang at 11:20 a.m. He then took a car back to the provincial government. The members of the provincial government and Zhang Huizan, Yue Sen, and others, upon hearing the news, went to pay their respects. It is said that Lu said to the members of the provincial government that the general outline for suppressing bandits in the three provinces had been drafted by the headquarters. Commander-in-Chief Chiang, in order to completely eliminate the Communist bandits, not only telegraphed to Hunan and Guangdong to actively increase their troops in areas bordering Jiangxi but also agreed to transfer two divisions, Jiang Dingwen's and Cai Tingkai's, into Jiangxi. During his visit to Beijing and Wuhan, he paid his respects to Chairman Chiang and Director He and asked for instructions on everything. He also met and negotiated with all the generals involved in this bandit suppression, such as Tan Daoyuan, Cai Tingkai, and He Yunqiao, and the negotiations were very satisfactory. In addition, because Lu had been away from Jiangxi for several days, there were many accumulated cases in the provincial government. Therefore, he decided to hold a meeting tomorrow (the 25th) to resolve all urgent matters at once. Regarding news about the Communist bandits, most of Zhu De and Mao Zedong's forces, about 20,000 to 30,000 men, are entrenched in the Ji'an, Jishui, and Xiajiang areas along the Gan River. Yesterday, they advanced from Xintu and approached Yongtai, 30 miles from Zhangshu. Most of Peng Dehuai and Huang Gonglue's forces, about 20,000 men, are still occupying Fenyi and Xinyu and are attacking Sanhu, Qingjiang, from the Yuan River to coordinate with Zhu and Mao. Most of Zhang Fakui and Tan Daoyuan's divisions are on the front line in Zhangshu and Fengcheng, on both sides of the Gan River. Gong Bingfan's division is still on the defensive in Gao'an, guarding against Xinyu and Qingjiang. According to a certain important military figure, the reason why the large army has not actively attacked despite being gathered together is that this bandit suppression is different from the previous "bandit-chasing bandit suppression." They will not stop until they are completely eliminated. Therefore, they are currently waiting for the troops from Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, and Hubei to arrive at the appropriate locations before launching a general offensive to encircle and annihilate them and prevent them from escaping. Generally speaking, the time for the general offensive should be after Mao Bingwen's division arrives at the Fujian border. According to a telephone call from Jiujiang, Mao Bingwen and Xu Kexiang will both arrive in the province by special train from Guanzhou today or tomorrow to pay their respects to Lu and ask for instructions on bandit suppression and to discuss everything.

<h3>Chen Tiaoyuan's Troops Triumphant and Stationed in Anhui</h3>
<p>Fan Xiji's Division Deploys to Northern Anhui. Ruan Zhaochang's Division Deploys to Southern Anhui. The General Headquarters Decides to Be Established in Bengbu. Bengbu Correspondence. Chen Tiaoyuan, the newly appointed Chairman of Anhui Province, triumphantly returned from Zhengzhou and immediately led his troops to Anhui to take charge of defense and bandit suppression. Chen himself has not yet come to Anhui to take office because he is visiting his mother in Shanghai. The General Headquarters has decided to be established in Bengbu (Chen may travel between the province and Bengbu after taking office). Currently, it is still temporarily located at the Traffic Villa because a suitable address has not yet been found. Most of the personnel from the eight departments have arrived in Bengbu one after another. Chief of Staff Li Erkan is currently stationed at the Fengyang Customs Office. Those stationed at the Traffic Villa are the Staff Department (Director Jiang Yiyuan), the Adjutant Department (Director Bai Yushan), the Military Supervision Department (Director Liu Jingqi), the Secretariat (Secretary-General Liu Fuqing), and the Communications Department (Director Ji Zizhen). The Ordnance Department (Director Wang Kaiqing) is temporarily located at the Dongya Hotel, and the Medical Department (Director Hao Zihua) is temporarily located at the Yingbin Hotel. The Transportation Department (Director Zhao Chunpu) is also on its way and will arrive soon. The Military Station has been ordered to close and be placed under Chen's control. The headquarters of the 26th Army, also transferred from Zhengzhou, is temporarily located at the Dadong Hotel. The Adjutant Department (Director Huang Dianwen) is temporarily located at the Tongshang Apartment. The wireless radio station is temporarily located at the Zhongxing Coal Mine Company. It is reported that the army headquarters will soon move to Anqing. The 46th Division, led by Army Commander Fan Xiji, has been ordered to deploy to Yingzhou and Bozhou in northern Anhui. Fan arrived in Bozhou yesterday with the staff of the division headquarters. It is reported that he still needs to come to Bengbu for a visit. The 46th Division's triumphant return from Henan has been hampered by a shortage of vehicles on the Longhai Railway, which is insufficient to allocate. Therefore, transportation has been quite difficult. In addition to the army headquarters personnel and equipment being transported by a small number of vehicles, most of the troops have marched east from Zhengzhou. The 46th Division's directly subordinate units that are in the process of departing, such as the Engineer Battalion of the Special Service Battalion led by Wang Chunru (the position of Battalion Commander is temporarily held by Deputy Battalion Commander Li) and the Artillery Battalion led by Li E and the Cavalry Company led by Sun Zongji, have already partially arrived in Bozhou. The other units that are in the process of departing are the 271st Regiment led by Bai Xinshan and the 272nd Regiment led by Yang Changyin of the 136th Brigade led by Wang Fanqing, and the 273rd Regiment led by Zhu Jiagan and the 274th Regiment led by Yuan Jinjian of the 137th Brigade led by Chen Jiugong, and the 275th Regiment (led by Liu himself) and the 276th Regiment led by Zhou Baohua of the 138th Brigade led by Liu Yulin. The three brigades are all stationed in northern Anhui, but how the defense areas will be assigned has not yet been determined. The 55th Division led by Ruan Zhaochang, after its triumphant return from Henan, along with its directly subordinate units and the 164th Brigade led by Li Songshan (Li concurrently serves as the Deputy Division Commander) and the 165th Brigade led by Zhang Bin, are all waiting for trains in Xuchang to deploy to southern Anhui. However, because the central government believes that the Communist bandits in southern Anhui are rampant and urgently need a large army to go and suppress them severely, it has first ordered the 163rd Brigade led by Yang Mingfang to quickly take a train to Changshan. Brigade Commander Yang led the Second Battalion of the 325th Regiment of his unit at 8:00 a.m. today (the 25th) and passed through Bengbu by train heading south. As soon as they arrive at Pukou, they will transfer to riverboats and head west. The First and Third Battalions of the regiment and the entire 326th Regiment will also take a train south. It is reported that they will all be deployed to the Datong area and then advance to suppress the Communist bandits. As for the 57th Division led by Yue Shengxuan, its directly subordinate troops and the 170th Brigade led by Liang Hongen are currently stationed in Anqing, and the 171st Brigade led by Wang Leshan is currently stationed in Wuhu. As for the 169th Brigade led by Song Runtian, there was a previous rumor that it would be transferred from Xuzhou to the southern section of the Jinpu Railway. It is now under the command of the General Headquarters and will remain stationed in Xuzhou and will not be transferred south for the time being. (October 25)</p>

<h3>Gu Yingfen Arrives in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Gu Yingfen, the Secretary-General of the National Government, having left the capital and traveled to Shanghai, returned to Guangdong and arrived in the province by ship this morning (the 21st) via Hong Kong. Many important figures from the military and political circles went to welcome him. It is reported that Mr. Gu traveled south from Shanghai on the President Lincoln ship on the 18th of this month and arrived in Hong Kong at 6:00 PM on the 20th. He did not disembark but immediately transferred to the provincial-Hong Kong night ferry, the Dragon Mountain. He arrived in the province at 6:35 AM today. As the Dragon Mountain slowly sailed from Bai'e Pond to the Xihaokou Pier, Gu and his companions stepped out onto the Western-style restaurant balcony, raised their hats, and waved to the welcoming people standing on the pier. At 6:40 AM, after the ship docked and the gangway was lowered, Gu disembarked and shook hands with all those who came to greet him. They then took cars back to Gu's private residence on Cangbian Road to chat. Military and political figures of the province, having received Gu's telegram informing them of his return, went to Hong Kong to welcome him in succession. These included Lu Kuangmin, Counselor of the National Government; Lin Zhimian, Committee Member of the River Management Association; Tan Huiquan, Committee Member of the Municipal Party Department; Cheng Tiangu, Director of the Public Works Bureau; Gu's wife; and many representatives of the provincial government. Those who welcomed him at the Dragon Mountain Pier included Du Yiqian, Representative of the Eighth Route Army Headquarters; Lin Shiqing, Commander of the Military Police; Shen Zaihe, Deputy Director of the Central Bank; Wu Boliang, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau; He Chichang, Director of the Health Bureau; Li Zhongzhen, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau; and representatives of various agencies, no less than seventy or eighty people. Military Police Commander Lin Shiqing had also dispatched a platoon of the Second Military Police Unit to the vicinity of the Dragon Mountain Pier to cooperate with the Taiping Branch police in guarding the area until Gu departed. This afternoon, I drove to Gu's residence to pay my respects and was received by Mr. Gu, with whom I had the following conversation: (Question) Mr. Gu, what is the purpose of your return to the province? (Answer) I have long wanted to return to the province to take care of family matters and treat my back boils. However, because I was needed to help with the military campaign against Yan and Feng, I was only able to make the trip after the suppression of the rebellion and Chairman Jiang returned to Nanjing. This time, I am only here to take care of family matters and take the opportunity to have my back boils treated. I have no other mission. (Question) It is rumored that you will stay in the province and take up an official position. Is that true? (Answer) Absolutely not. Those who spread such rumors probably have ulterior motives. For the past two years, Guangdong Province has been surrounded by forces of reaction, such as the Guangxi Gui clique, the communist bandits in Jiangxi and Fujian, all of whom have been constantly seeking opportunities to invade us. Fortunately, Chairman Chen, Commander-in-Chief Chen, and our armed comrades have worked together to defend us, and stability has been achieved, and politics is improving day by day. I am very happy that we have found the right people. What ability do I have to take up an important position in Guangdong? The rumors are ridiculous. (Question) It is also rumored that Chairman Chen will be promoted to the position of President of the Executive Yuan. Is there any truth to this? (Answer) I have not heard whether Chairman Chen will become the President of the Executive Yuan, but it is certainly not true that I will take up an important position in Guangdong. (Question) It is also rumored that you or Mr. Yu Youren will succeed to the position of President of the Executive Yuan. Is this also a rumor? (Answer) This is just speculation. People probably think that after the death of President Tan, someone needs to be chosen to succeed him, and the successor should be an experienced person. That is why they say this. In fact, the central government has not yet fully discussed this issue, and the selection of a candidate still needs to wait. (Question) You have just returned from the capital. What can you tell us about the recent situation in the party and government? (Answer) The most important thing in the party recently is to convene the Fourth Plenary Session to resolve all national issues. The meeting is scheduled to open on November 12th. Many members of the Executive Committee from various places are now arriving in Nanjing to prepare to participate. However, time is very tight, and I am not sure if I will be able to return to Nanjing to attend. As for politics, Chairman Jiang has recently made many excellent suggestions that, if implemented, will lead the country to a state of great prosperity. The security situation in the capital is improving day by day, and civil servants are generally working hard. (Question) Is the military campaign against Yan and Feng in the Northwest considered to be over? (Answer) The speed of Yan and Feng's defeat and the extent of their losses were truly unexpected. It is estimated that Yan and Feng now have no more than 30% of their troops left, and they are surrendering to the central government. The military campaign is largely over. From now on, there will only be post-war issues in the Northwest. The central government is now organizing the Northwest Political Affairs Committee to work with Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang to handle all post-war affairs in the Northwest. (Question) It is said that Chairman Jiang will meet with Commander-in-Chief Zhang Xueliang to discuss the resolution of all national issues. Is that true? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Where and when will they meet? (Answer) Both are undecided, but Commander-in-Chief Zhang has recently planned to go to Beijing to meet with Chairman Jiang. (Question) If Commander-in-Chief Zhang does not go to Beijing, will Chairman Jiang go to Beiping to meet with him? (Answer) Chairman Jiang did not mention it when I left Beijing. (Question) What are Chairman Jiang's views on resolving the Zhang-Gui conflict? It is said that he will transfer the divisions of Jiang Guangding and Cai Tingkai, or other units, to the south to assist in the suppression. Is that true? (Answer) Chairman Jiang believes that with an army of hundreds of thousands, such as Yan and Feng, he was still not able to pacify them. He does not have any special views on resolving the Zhang-Gui conflict. The movements of the Jiang and Cai divisions are undecided, and there is no news of additional units being transferred to Guangxi to assist in the suppression. But the strength of the Zhang-Gui army has completely disappeared. With Commander-in-Chief Chen leading the Eighth Route Army to suppress them, it is more than enough to quell the conflict. (Question) When will the central government decide to restore the Guangxi provincial government? Has a list of candidates for chairman and committee members been drawn up? (Answer) The central government believes that the military situation in Guangxi has not been completely resolved, and all political affairs are being handled by the Eighth Route Army Headquarters. Therefore, the organization of the Guangxi provincial government has been postponed, and the list of candidates for chairman and committee members is undecided. (Answer) It is rumored that Jiang Guangding will be appointed as the Chairman of Guangxi. Is that true? (Answer) The central government has no intention of doing so. (Question) You are also the Chairman of the River Management Association. Huangpu Port is the southern port designated by the Premier. The River Management Association is actively carrying out its development. When will construction begin? (Answer) This is a great project designated by the Premier, and we must complete it. However, the first thing we need is funding. It is estimated that it will cost seventy to eighty million to develop Huangpu Port and deepen the nearby waterways. It has been decided that more than twenty million will be allocated from the Boxer Indemnity funds. We still need forty to fifty million, which we plan to raise by issuing public bonds. The people of Guangdong Province will surely enthusiastically support this great project, which is of vital interest to them, and it will not be difficult to complete. We are currently surveying the area and will begin construction as soon as the plan is completed. (Question) Will Tangjiawan Zhongshan Port be developed at the same time as Huangpu Port? (Answer) The Premier only designated Huangpu Port, not Zhongshan Port. Therefore, we should first complete Huangpu Port. (Question) How is your back boil? Do you need to be hospitalized for treatment? (Answer) My back boil started three years ago. At first, it was only the size of a fingertip and did not cause much pain, so I did not pay attention to it. However, in recent months, it has gradually grown to the size of a tangerine, causing very painful stabbing pains at night. Therefore, I took the opportunity to ask for leave and return to the province to have it surgically removed to avoid future problems. (Question) Have you decided when and at which hospital you will have the surgery? (Answer) This boil needs to be treated quickly. I plan to be admitted to the hospital tonight or tomorrow night. However, I still need to investigate which hospital is the best choice. (Question) It is said that Commander-in-Chief Chen will return from Wuzhou to the province to meet with you. Is that true? (Answer) Commander-in-Chief Chen is currently supervising the troops and suppressing the rebellion at the front. I would not dare to trouble him to return to the province. I plan to go to Wuzhou to meet with him as soon as my back boil improves. (Question) Did you meet with Chairman Chen Mingshu, Mayor Lin Yunhai, Director Deng Yanhua, Committee Member Lin Yizhong, and Director Qu Fangpu in Beijing? (Answer) I met with all of them. Chairman Chen went to Shanghai one or two days after arriving in Beijing and then returned south. I did not have a detailed discussion with him. His itinerary for returning south is undecided. (Question) Is it true that Minister Song Ziwen has resigned? (Answer) That is not true. I saw his official denial in the newspapers when I arrived in Shanghai. After talking about this, I excused myself and left. (21st)</p>
<h3>Lu Xingbang Plans to Flee to Zhejiang and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>First Retreat to Jian'ou, Then Retreat to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Border. Fuzhou Dispatch: The Fujian Provincial Army for the Suppression of Lu launched another general offensive on the 20th. It has been learned that the Liu Shangzhi Brigade of the Central Column of the Eastern Route Army has advanced from Shuikou Town to Sandukou. Lu's troops have retreated to the Hulu Mountain and Zhanghu Ban area, 40 li upstream of Sandukou. The Lu troops in that area are also moving in that direction. Therefore, the front line of the army for the suppression of Lu is only about 100 li away from Yanping. At the same time, the Western Route Army has also attacked from Dehua into Datian, pressing towards Youxi, and has dispatched naval aircraft from Xiamen to assist in the battle. As a result, both Youxi and Yanping are in a state of chaos. According to a report from the Eastern Route Army, Lu Xingrong, seeing the dangerous situation, convened an emergency meeting in Yanping to discuss the final strategy. Zhou Zhiqun, Yu Bailiang, Zhou Guanhong, Wei Chu, and others were present. They concluded that peace negotiations had failed and fighting was impossible, so the only option was to flee to the border area between Fujian, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang provinces in order to preserve the remaining forces. It was then decided that the various agencies in Yanping should be ordered to wind up affairs and that the families and baggage that had been moved from Yanping to Youxi should be moved back to Yanping in order to leave Fujian with the army. The retreat plan was divided into two steps: the first step was to retreat from Yanping to Jian'ou; the second step was to divide into two routes from Jian'ou, one entering Jiangxi via Pucheng and the other entering Zhejiang via Songxi, and then converge on the Jiangxi-Zhejiang border. Zhou Zhiqun's troops would be the vanguard, and Lu Xingrong's troops would be the rear guard. Upon hearing this news, the provincial army has ordered the Lin Shuguo Brigade, formerly the Right Flank Marine Corps of Gutian, to move its troops to the direction of Songxi to intercept them. It is also reported that Zhou Zhiqun's troops have moved from Yanping to Nankou and Shuiji in Jian'ou. The military situation is expected to shift from northern Fujian to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi border.

<h3>Hu Ruoyu Returns to Qingdao from Tianjin</h3>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: Qingdao Mayor Hu Ruoyu, having returned to Qingdao from Nanjing, did not even have time to warm his seat before going to Shenyang to report everything to Zhang Xueliang. He then went from Shenyang to Tianjin on official business. Now that his business is completed, he returned to Qingdao on the Changping Maru on the 23rd with his wife and daughter. He arrived at the port at 3:30 PM. Important officials of the municipal government and heads of various bureaus and the security team went to the dock to welcome him. After Mr. Hu disembarked, he took a car with his wife to the International Sanatorium. I visited Mr. Hu to ask about the important mission of his trip north, and Mr. Hu said: [I went to Liaoning to meet with Director Zhang to ask for instructions and did not have any mission. As for my trip to Tianjin, I went there to bring my family, who reside in Tianjin. The rumor that Liaoning sent me to Shijiazhuang to persuade Yan and Feng to step down is completely false. Director Zhang has no intention of entering the Pass recently. Even if he goes to Beiping, it will only be for inspection purposes and he will not stay long. The war in various places has ended, and there are no problems with the current situation. The post-war affairs in North China are being planned.] (October 23rd)</p>
<h3>Jinan Reporter Inspection Group Arrives in Qingdao</h3>
<p>Qingdao Press Circles Host Banquet in Welcome. Jiaoji Railway Bureau Hosts Qingdao-Jinan Reporters. Qingdao Dispatch: In order to allow the Chinese people to understand the losses suffered by the Jiaoji Railway in the recent war, the bureau has invited reporters from Qingdao and Jinan to conduct on-site inspections along the railway. The Jinan Reporter Inspection Group, consisting of twenty people, arrived in Qingdao this morning (the 22nd) by the second train from Jinan. At noon, the Qingdao press circles hosted a banquet for the group at the Yadong Hotel. Wang Jingxi, a reporter from the Qingdao Minbao, was elected to deliver a welcome speech, hoping that the press circles of Qingdao and Jinan would take this opportunity to meet, unite, and promote the development of the press industry in a spirit of mutual assistance. Ren Xiaoqing, a reporter from the Jinan Chenguang Daily, delivered a reply on behalf of the group. After the meal, the group went to the Yingzhou Hotel, which was reserved by the Railway Bureau.

<h3>Jiangsu Agricultural Bank Manages Grain Storage and Mortgage</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Bank has encouraged cooperatives to engage in agricultural product storage and mortgage businesses and has piloted small farmers' grain mortgage loans so that farmers can avoid the pain of selling cheap and buying expensive. The results of two years of operation have been good. This year, all counties have reported a bumper autumn harvest. However, when new grain enters the market every year, grain prices inevitably fall gradually, and farmers at this time need funds to repay debts. They have no choice but to sell agricultural products at low prices. Now, with the abundance of rice and grain in various places, rice prices have fallen even more sharply, recently falling to an average of about ten yuan. Between spring and summer, rice prices soared to more than twenty yuan. At that time, farmers who ate one dan of rice had to repay it with the selling price of two dan at the time of the new harvest. Therefore, no matter how abundant the harvest is, the hidden losses are considerable. Moreover, judging from the depletion of rice and grain reserves last year, if no preparations are made in advance, there may still be a food shortage when the seasons are lean next year. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has issued an order to all counties to speed up preparations for grain storage in order to prepare for famine when rice and grain are abundant and at fair prices this year. However, the warehouses in various counties have long been abolished, and it is feared that it will not be easy to organize them in a short time. It is reported that the Agricultural Bank, in view of this, believes that managing small farmers' grain storage and mortgage is a matter of urgency in order to provide farmers with opportunities for turnover and avoid losses due to low grain prices. It has been approved by the Supervisory Committee to set up agricultural warehouses in its branches in various places, such as Wujin, Wuxi, Wujiang, Changshu, Kunshan, Qingpu. It will first prepare one million yuan this year to pilot the project, which can store and mortgage more than 100,000 dan of farmers' rice and grain. Preparations are being actively made and mortgage operations will begin next month.</p>
<h3>Beiping Business Community Comes to Shenyang to Petition</h3>
<p>Please Abolish Chongwenmen Customs and Brokerage Tax. Shenyang Dispatch: In order to advocate for the abolition of the Chongwenmen Customs tax, the Beiping business community sent five representatives: Leng Jiaji, Yang Yijian, Zou Quansun, Jin Zhihua, and Zhao Yanchen, all standing committee members of the Beiping General Chamber of Commerce. They arrived in Shenyang at 6:40 AM on the 20th by train on the Beining Railway and stayed at the Central Hotel on Sanjing Road. At noon, they met with Jin Enqi and Lu Naigeng, the presidents of the Liaoning General Chamber of Commerce. Then, at 7:00 PM in the evening, Leng and Yang, representing the others, paid a visit to Zhang Xueliang at his private residence to explain the urgent request of the Beiping business community to abolish the customs tax. Zhang agreed to discuss the matter with the Ministry of Finance and wait for a comprehensive plan. The representatives then took their leave. At noon on the 21st, He Fenglin, Xing Shilian, and others hosted a banquet for the representatives at the Jiaotong Hotel. In the evening, the Shenyang Station Branch of the China Railway Business Promotion Association hosted a banquet for Leng and others at the Yanchunfang Restaurant because Leng was the director of the association, to express their welcome. During the banquet, the Shenyang association's affairs were discussed. I met with Leng Jiaji yesterday to inquire about the results of the petition. According to him, the results were quite satisfactory. Deputy Commander Zhang has essentially agreed to abolish the customs tax, but there must be certain steps in the administration. The representatives are scheduled to visit Gao Jiyi, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, today (the 22nd) to discuss matters related to railway transportation. The mission of this trip will then be completed. They will leave Shenyang tonight or tomorrow morning and stay in Tianjin for a day or two to visit Wang Shuchang, the chairman of Hebei Province, and request the abolition of other miscellaneous taxes and levies in Hebei Province. The petition of the representatives requesting the abolition of the provincial and municipal brokerage tax is recorded below: [We have investigated that the brokerage tax was originally established in the feudal era to regulate local officials. Because local officials had salaries but no stipends, the expenses required for official trips and receptions could not be properly accounted for and had to rely on the brokers to provide funding. All food and supplies for the various government offices were also provided by the brokers according to the official prices set. In addition, sedan chair carriers were also provided by the footmen occupying space. Therefore, there were no expenses. However, this kind of business was purely for the local gentry to act as pawns for the government, using their direct access to the people to provide for the government in order to enjoy their profits. Anyone with a little wealth who cherishes his reputation, even if he suffers hunger and hardship, would never be willing to undertake this low job. The so-called car, boat, shop, foot, and broker are not good and honest people who can do it. In the Qing Dynasty, there were two types of brokers: those who handled large businesses had to obtain a ministry license, commonly known as the dragon ticket, and those who handled retail businesses had to obtain a post from the government office in charge, commonly known as the brokerage ticket. Anyone who obtained a dragon ticket or a brokerage ticket could rely on it to be a family business for generations to come, no less than raising a group of idlers who have no legitimate occupation to exploit the business community. In fact, buying and selling brokers in various countries have statutory regulations. After preparing definite capital in accordance with the regulations and obtaining a license in compliance with the regulations, they can operate. The commissions earned are also subject to statutory restrictions, and are completely enjoyed by human labor and capital. It is not comparable to China's situation where people who have no capital or strength take commissions with bare hands. Moreover, it costs very little to obtain brokerage tax tickets and posts. The government does not gain much profit from it. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, it should have been completely abolished. However, in the name of rectifying tax collection, this brokerage tax has been transformed into a formal and large tax. The method of changing the bidding every year is nothing more than harassing the business community. At a time when the people are in extreme poverty, if the government still disregards the lives and deaths of the people and does not reduce the burden on the business community, then hunger and cold will force people to take risks, which is no different from inviting internal disorder. This kind of brokerage tax, which is useless to the government and harmful to the business community, should not exist any longer. If it can be resolutely abolished and a remedy can be found, the business community in the province and city will be relieved of a heavy burden, living will be reduced, and good governance can be expected. If, due to the large amount of government expenses, it is feared that it will be difficult to remedy after the abolition, each business can temporarily bear the amount of this year's bidding according to the number of bids for each business in order to avoid the brokers from manipulating and controlling the situation, and to remove the corruption and return the profits to the public. When the government's budget and tax revenue have a sound method, it can be completely abolished. In this way, the government's tax revenue will not be reduced in the slightest, and the burden on each business will be greatly reduced. Moreover, the people can enjoy the benefits of cheap materials. It can be said to be a win-win situation. After this, people can seek a livelihood in a proper way and dare not have the ambition to rely on power to advance and exploit their compatriots. Moreover, when the brokerage companies change their bidding every year, no matter how well the handling agency compromises, those who do not bid will inevitably have various troubles, even if the discussions are confusing and it is difficult to distinguish right from wrong, it is tantamount to the government encouraging unemployed vagrants and making them take advantage of the situation to act recklessly in the countryside and harass the business community. For example, the annual tax for each item of ordinary products is only several hundred yuan, but those who win the bid for handling can earn no less than several thousand or tens of thousands of yuan from buying, selling, entering, and leaving commissions every year. The extent to which this harms the business community is evident. Wherever there is profit, people will compete. If there are several bidding opportunities every year, the unemployed will inevitably attach great importance to it, competing with each other in a cycle. How can this be a country? At a time when the material civilization of all countries in the world is evolving, especially in commercial competition to seek national life, there is absolutely no such thing as deliberately indulging the people to take the wrong path and harm each other, and the government taking advantage of this to seek profits can establish a country. For the sake of the overall situation of the country and for the sake of the people's livelihood, everything must be considered. The relationship is extremely important. For this reason, we earnestly implore Your Honor to have extra compassion, and humbly request that you issue a clear order to abolish or find another remedy to relieve the business community and maintain the people's livelihood. This will be a great deed of benevolence.]</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>President Lin Visits Songjiang to Plan the Construction of a Prison. The buildings of the county prison have been in disrepair for many years, and the number of prisoners has exceeded the capacity. This not only raises concerns about incidents but also violates public health. The High Court previously sent inspectors to Songjiang to conduct an inspection and found that construction was necessary. Yesterday, Lin Biao, the President of the High Court, and Secretary Yao visited Songjiang. Zhu, the President of the County Court, Zhang, the Procurator, Han, the Warden, and the Head of the Detention Center welcomed them. Lin briefly inquired about the key points of judicial administration and then accompanied them to inspect the detention center and the prison. He had lunch at the court and invited local figures Zhou Heyun and Cai Zhongyu to accompany him. During the meal, they talked about the construction of the prison. It is planned to build a new-style prison on the site of the detention center and convert the old prison into a detention center. The construction cost is estimated to be about 150,000 to 160,000 yuan. The High Court approved an allocation of more than 100,000 yuan and requested that the local community raise funds to help achieve the project as soon as possible. Zhou, Cai, and others said that the construction of the prison is indeed aimed at improving the lives of criminals, but the local community feels that various donations are burdensome and may not be able to cope easily. They requested that the project be postponed slightly to facilitate progress. Soon after, President Lin was anxious to return to Shanghai and then to Suzhou. After the banquet, he left the court and went to the station to take a train back to Suzhou. The Second Meeting of the Four Counties Joint Defense.

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Robbery Case in Yangming Township: In the 3rd District of Wuxi (Yangming), in Wang Caoke Lane, there lived two brothers, Wang Shousheng and Wang Renguan, in the 26th and 27th Tús. Although they had divided their property, they still lived in the same house, which had four rooms. Shousheng often traveled to Singapore in the South Seas to trade in antiques and jade, accumulating a considerable profit. Recently, he returned home for his daughter's wedding. However, just one day after the joyous occasion, more than ten robbers, all speaking with a Jiangbei accent, carrying pistols and flashlights, and wearing light blue short shirts and pants, broke open the main gate with a stone bar and entered the inner room. They silenced everyone, demanding to know the location of the hidden silver. They ransacked the place, stealing a total of 230 silver dollars and clothing and jewelry worth about 1700-1800 dollars, amounting to a total loss of over 2000 dollars. After the robbers fled with their loot, the victims reported the incident to the Yangxi Police Station of the 8th Public Security Bureau, which immediately dispatched police to search in all directions. However, the robbers had already escaped to Nanqiao Town.</p>
<p>Large Fire in Nanqiao Town: In the 3rd District of the county (Yangming Township), the Ni family (who run the Ni Dafang paper goods and sundries store in the town) in Nanqiao Town, at 12:40 AM the night before, were carelessly making cotton clothes when a spark from the iron accidentally fell onto the fabric, causing a fire. Dense smoke immediately billowed out, rising through the roof and spreading to the adjacent Chen family's house. After the local fire brigade heard the alarm, they rushed to the scene and worked tirelessly to extinguish the fire, finally putting it out after about three hours. In this incident, the two front and middle buildings of the Ni family and one building of the Chen family, as well as furniture, clothing, and other items, were burned, resulting in a loss of tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Distressed After Dreaming of Mother's Death, Commits Suicide: Chen Xu, a resident of Yangjian Town in the 8th District of the county (Huaixia City), had two children: a son who is currently doing business in Japan, and a daughter named Zhongying, who is 19 years old. She had previously studied at a certain girls' school in the county and was admitted this spring to the silkworm farming school run by the Zhenjiang United Improvement Association, where she lived. On the night of the 20th of this month, Ms. Chen suddenly dreamed that her elderly mother had been killed by robbers in her hometown, with blood flowing everywhere. She woke up and cried hysterically. Although her classmates tried their best to comfort her, Ms. Chen was stubborn and could not be relieved. Later that night, she secretly hanged herself on the bed. By the time it was discovered, she had already died. The school principal immediately telegraphed Ms. Chen's home. Her mother, Chen Xu, was overwhelmed with grief upon hearing the news. She immediately went to the town to buy a coffin and collect the body, which was transported back to Wuxi for burial yesterday. It is indeed a tragic event.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>A Letter from Ye Zonglian, Owner of Taishun Yuan Rice Store in Taishun: Respected Editor, I have just read the Songjiang correspondence in your newspaper of October 26th, titled "Store Owner Abuses Student, Student Runs Away and Disappears," which stated that the student was severely beaten, etc. I once ordered the student to purchase rice in Qingpu, which was a common occurrence. How could this student, disobeying instructions, purchase rice in Chonggu Town, which he had never been to before? Being unfamiliar with the place, he was inevitably deceived, resulting in prices exceeding the limit. I did reprimand the student for the sake of his studies, but the student did not accept the reprimand and asked for leave to go home on the morning of the 24th. I granted him permission to return. Unexpectedly, that evening, he returned to work at the store. The student is still working at the store and is not in any danger. The report in your newspaper does not correspond with the facts. Fearing that the distant report is inaccurate, I am writing this letter to request that your newspaper make a correction to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>Educational News Highlights</p>
<h3>Important Talk by Chiang Menglin</h3>
<p>Regarding the dispute between National Central University and Labor University, I happened to meet Minister of Education Chiang yesterday at the ministry and inquired about his views on the dispute between the two universities. Here is a record of his remarks: I learned about the student movement to improve school affairs at National Central University and the resignation of President Zhang from the newspapers. The students of National Central University have consistently used a peaceful approach to promote school affairs and have not taken any excessive actions. They have never expressed anything to the Ministry of Education, so I believe that the students of National Central University are capable of following the right path and are a blessing to the school. As for the resignation of President Zhang, the Ministry of Education has not yet received the document. Based on past experiences, the resignation and appointment of presidents of national schools are not directly handled by the National Government. After the National Government receives any resignation letter from the president of a national school, it must be transferred to the Ministry of Education for joint handling. This time, President Zhang expressed his intention to resign to Chairman Chiang through a private letter, which is not a formal resignation, so there is no need to transfer it to the Ministry of Education. The report that President Zhang's resignation has been approved is something I have not heard of. National Central University is located in the capital, and its importance is paramount among national schools. The departure of the president is a matter of great importance to the safety and security of the school and cannot be decided by just one or two people. If President Zhang truly intends to resign, the government should carefully consider it, consult in many ways, and strive for a proper solution to ensure the safety of the school. Regarding the issue of Labor University, the Ministry of Education originally intended to take over Labor University so that it could be reorganized. Now that the takeover is proving difficult, it will have to wait until a new president is appointed, who will then be responsible for handling it.</p>
<h3>Open Letter to Fellow Students from the Student Union of National Central University</h3>
<p>Our school is located in the capital and serves as a model for the entire country, bearing the responsibility for upholding Chinese culture. Recently, we have been striving for internal enrichment and vigorous development. As our fellow students come forward to make suggestions and strive for improvement, they are all based on a love for the school and a unified advocacy. However, recently, rumors have arisen, claiming that a certain faction wants to take advantage of the opportunity to engage in activities and seize power, or that a certain department wants to disrupt school affairs. Although these are baseless rumors, they are not enough to move the ears of intelligent people, and the teachers and students of our school are still studying diligently and remaining as stable as usual. However, the spread of rumors is deeply regrettable. The Student Union is duty-bound to come forward and refute them to stop the disturbances. The suggestions made by our fellow students are purely to improve internal matters and have nothing to do with external affairs. Outsiders who listen to rumors and spread them do not understand the true situation within the school. The Student Union has the following points to announce to our fellow students: First, we must prevent ambitious individuals from taking the opportunity to disrupt and ruin the studies of our fellow students. This matter started from a very small beginning, like the first sprouts of grass, but ambitious individuals take advantage of it to exaggerate it and have ulterior motives. Fortunately, our fellow students are very rational and will not be swayed. In the future, we should continue this spirit to demonstrate the attitude of scholars. Second, the Student Union will urge the school authorities to accept the opinions of our fellow students as much as possible in order to improve school affairs and develop our school into an ideal model university. Third, the Student Union will urge the school to reduce administrative expenses, increase equipment expenses, and reduce the economic burden on our fellow students. The waiver of lecture fees has already been approved by the president, and negotiations are continuing to reduce other fees, with the hope of success. Fourth, the Student Union suggests that the school only retain the secretariat and continue to set up both academic affairs and general affairs departments in order to avoid an imbalance of power and increase the efficiency of handling affairs. The Student Union sincerely hopes to effectively convey these intentions to improve school affairs. The Student Union is the mouthpiece of all the students in our school, and we must adhere to the goals that our fellow students want to achieve and work tirelessly to achieve them. Finally, the Student Union hopes that our fellow students will maintain a love for the school, use proper steps to improve school affairs, and, especially at this time of rumors, rely on a pure mind, make clear opinions, and be careful not to be used by others to fulfill their ambitions and plunge our National Central University into a state of destruction. My dear fellow students of the entire school, please consider this carefully.</p>
<h3>Recent Policies of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education</h3>
<p>On the 24th of this month, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education sent a representative to report on the department's recent policies at the Zhejiang Radio Broadcasting Station, disclosing the following: (1) Regarding local education funding, the department focused on sorting out education funds in the 19th year of the Republic. It has now formulated a survey form for county education funds and a survey form for district education funds, and ordered each county to conduct a thorough survey and report it as a basis for sorting out. (2) Regarding the moral education plan for primary and secondary schools, the Ministry of Education drafted standards for moral education in primary and secondary schools and issued documents containing moral education materials for primary and secondary schools, soliciting materials through notices. The department selected middle schools and excellent primary schools in counties and cities with outstanding achievements and required them to fill out and report within two weeks. The part that the department should fill out has now been filled out and is being compiled to send to the ministry. (3) Regarding local education guidance, the local education guidance plan was previously divided into nine chapters, consisting of two major parts: the moral education plan and the guidance plan, and was submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval and filing. It was printed into a separate volume and issued to be implemented. According to the moral education plan and guidance measures, the provincial middle schools, affiliated primary schools, and county and city governments in the area where they are located are required to draft plans, which the department will order to be drafted, reviewed, and approved to facilitate implementation. (4) Regarding mass education, the department previously issued a notice to all counties and cities in the province, requiring them to establish mass education centers within this year. According to the reports, 56 county centers have been established, and 35 county directors have been approved. During this period of political tutelage, mass education is of great importance. The remaining counties and cities that have not yet established mass education centers have been ordered to organize and establish them as soon as possible. In addition, libraries in counties and cities should be established independently as a principle. Currently, most are merged with mass education centers. Since the issuance of the library regulations, it has been reported that Yin County, Changxing, and other counties have been established independently, and directors have been appointed separately. The cities and counties that have not yet reported have been ordered to discuss and divide them. (5) Regarding the further study of primary school teachers, the department believes that there is a shortage of teachers in the province, and that current primary school teachers have few opportunities for further study. Holding summer workshops in various places is only temporary. To enable them to study regularly throughout the year, communication and research are the most appropriate and effective methods. Therefore, starting in the 19th year of the Republic, a correspondence research department for teacher further study was established within the department. Regulations were formulated and promulgated, and the number of students was tentatively set at 1,000, with primary school teachers from various counties and cities as students. The books to be studied were also specified. Currently, the number of applicants has reached 400. The various forms for registration are printed and distributed by the department and can be sent by simply writing a letter to request them. The Education Bureau does not need to reprint them, but the students should prepare the research books themselves. (6) Regarding budgets and final accounts, the department has repeatedly ordered the creation of budgets for education funds in various counties and cities in the 19th year of the Republic. According to the reports, two cities and 59 counties have submitted them to the department. Those that have not yet been submitted are Deqing, Wukang, Xiaofeng, Zhenhai, Xiangshan, Xianju, Ninghai, Wenling, Wuyi, Tangxi, Shanchang, Shouchang, Fenshui, Qingyun, Songyang, Yunhe, and other counties. In addition, the deadline for creating and submitting the final accounts for the 18th year of the Republic according to the central government's regulations has now passed. This matter is related to clarifying annual accounts and should not be delayed any longer. The department has ordered all provincial education institutions and county and city governments to compile them quickly and send them to the department for verification and transfer. (7) Regarding the Small Education Series, the Small Education Series has been compiled and printed by the department and sent out on schedule. It has been found that the 8th and 9th volumes of the second category that should have been sent have not yet been sent because the schools are currently in session. In addition, because this series of books arrives at various schools at a time when the teaching villages have often missed the opportunity, in order to meet urgent needs, the 10th volume has been compiled and printed first. The 8th and 9th volumes will still be issued as a supplement after they are completed.</p>

<h3>Anhui Provincial Annals Museum to be Reorganized</h3>
<p>Reorganization of the County Annals Compilation Committee</p>
<p>The provincial government meeting decided that the Anhui Provincial Annals Museum, which had been established for only a few months, was first due to financial problems, as the Ministry of Finance did not agree to collect additional taxes on farmland on its behalf. Then, it was due to the problem of hiring additional deputy curators. The provincial government decided to review the original documents. As a result of the review, the museum was fundamentally reorganized. The provincial government approved the reorganization plan at its 141st meeting. The review report is as follows: 1. Reorganize the Anhui Provincial County Annals Compilation Preparatory Committee. The Department of Civil Affairs will draft the regulations for the County Annals Compilation Committee, and the various expenses for the County Annals Compilation Committee and the future compilation of county annals will be included in the budget and paid by the provincial treasury. 3.

In the 18th year, the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party decided to integrate the educational purpose and method with Party ideology education to establish the foundation of education.

<p>Local News</p>
<p>City Training Department</p>
<h3>Order to Register Party Teachers</h3>
<p>Deadline set for the end of this month. Those who do not register will be punished. The registration of Party ideology teachers in Shanghai City has been underway since the Training Department of the Municipal Party Headquarters initiated it in early September.

<p>Third District Party Headquarters Actively Opposes the Public Works Department</p>
<h3>Unauthorized Establishment of a Concession Education Department</h3>
<p>Five measures decided upon, to be implemented immediately. The Third District Party Headquarters of this city believes that the Public Works Department of the Public Concession has arbitrarily established a Concession Education Department, which is a destructive act against our country's educational administration and a cultural invasion. The Fifth Executive Committee meeting of the association specifically proposed five measures: (1) issue a declaration of opposition; (2) convene a meeting of school principals in the district to discuss countermeasures; (3) announce that all schools unanimously reject investigation; (4) send a letter to the Fourth District Party Headquarters to convene a meeting of schools in that district for discussion; (5) petition the Municipal Party Headquarters to forward a request to the Municipal Government for serious negotiations with the Public Works Department of the Concession to immediately abolish the department. It is reported that the above measures have been separately put into action to achieve the goal of abolition. The declaration is recorded as follows: Education is the lifeblood of an independent nation and should not be interfered with by foreigners. The British imperialists, taking advantage of unequal treaties and using the Concession as a protective charm, dare to take advantage of the enthusiastic calls from our people to reclaim the right to education in the Concession and send personnel to investigate schools in the Concession, even deceiving school authorities by saying that schools in the Concession area, even if poorly managed, will not be subject to sanctions by Chinese authorities. People with knowledge have long recognized the fallacy of this absurdity. Now, instead of returning the right to education in the Concession to the Chinese people, they are establishing a so-called Public Works Department Education Department, which is the same as the highest educational administrative body in our country. This is not only related to the national system but also to manipulate the education within the Concession, disrupt our educational system, and expand its power to achieve its aggressive ambitions. People in the country are mostly obscured and do not know about the conspiracies and sinister plans. The Party Headquarters deeply regrets that the cultural invasion by imperialists is becoming deeper and more prevalent. We must loudly call to awaken the people in our Concession. In addition to submitting a serious request to the higher authorities and convening schools in the Concession to discuss countermeasures, we solemnly declare again that we hope that schools at all levels and compatriots from all walks of life will stand up to oppose education. Fortunately, the Party and the country are fortunate. This is our declaration.</p>
<h3>Two Recent News Items from the Astronomical Research Institute</h3>
<p>Solar Spectrograph Arrives; 24-inch Reflector Telescope Ordered. The Astronomical Research Institute entrusted the Mount Wilson Observatory in the United States to purchase a solar spectrograph this spring, which arrived last month. The function of this instrument is to capture light of various wavelengths in the solar spectrum to study the activity on the surface of the sun. During observation, part of the instrument is placed outdoors, and part of the instrument is placed in a dark room. A small window is opened to allow light to enter. The institute is currently working on converting the original building into a dark room, and the project will be completed in about half a month. At that time, it will be installed and tested to start research. In addition, the institute recently entrusted the Shanghai Lihuo Foreign Company to order a 24-inch reflector telescope and an observation elevator from the Zeiss factory in Germany, costing about 100,500 yuan. Half of the deposit has been paid, and production has begun in Germany. It will take two years to complete. Telescopes are generally divided into two categories: refracting telescopes and reflecting telescopes. The instrument ordered by the institute will be the largest reflecting telescope in observatories in the Far East after it arrives. It is also reported that the institute has successively purchased five major instruments within a year, and the facilities of the observatory are generally considered complete. Second District.</p>

<h3>Jiaotong University's Zheng President Resigns to Take Charge of Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>It is heard that the Central Government values education and appreciates Zheng’s aspirations and may approve his resignation. However, it must wait until the National Industry and Commerce Conference closes before he can be released, so he must still travel between the two places. In addition to coming to Shanghai to attend Jiaotong University’s anniversary week today, Zheng also held a school affairs meeting at 4 pm at Hu’an Building. In addition, more than 200 people attended the teachers and students concert held by the Law School of the school in Hua’an the day before yesterday.

<p>Sports</p>
<p>Yesterday's First Division Match of the Westerners' Association</p>
<h3>Lehua's Insufficient Number of Players</h3>
<p>Only seven people arrived, forfeiting the game to the Western Police. Since Lehua returned from reorganization abroad, although its fighting strength is not what it used to be, its fighting spirit can still be maintained. It initially lost to Huacesi in the Westerners’ Association First Division, and then to Zhenru. Yesterday, it could not form a team to fight against the Western Police at Shenyuan, forfeiting the game with a score of zero to one, which is regrettable. Lehua's future may decline from this. Recalling the grand occasion of this day last year seems to be in another world. This is also a small vicissitude in Shanghai's football scene. The players who arrived on the day included Lu Zhongen, Gao Dahan, Jin Fengde, Xi Qiaosheng, Yang Renwei, Sun Xingyan, and Wang Jihuai, as well as staff members Yu Hengzhi and Rong Qizhao. Li Huitang and Li Ningan Yuanan were all injured and did not come. They waited quietly outside the dressing room until 3:20, but no other generals came. The one or two thousand spectators present only saw the Western Police soldiers moving their feet, and there was no trace of Lehua players. The spectators doubted this and applauded continuously to urge each other endlessly. Later, the Western Police and Lehua agreed to mix and divide into two teams as an exhibition match. After this twist, the Lehua players slowly appeared on the stage. The number of team members was insufficient, and pillars Li Huitang and Li Ning were not there. The spectators were greatly disappointed, and some got up and left, while others sat and watched. At the same time, the incident of demanding the return of ticket money occurred. After some negotiation, spectators with four-corner tickets got their wish, while those who bought one-yuan tickets were the exception. There were also some slight conflicts at that time, but fortunately, they were resolved quickly and peacefully. The Western Police firmly transferred Dunner and goalkeeper Brett to serve Lehua, and this funny short play was also quite interesting. In the first half (changed to 25 minutes), Lehua lost three goals. In the second half, they took the lead with two to one. As a result, Lehua lost with a score of two to four.</p>

<p>Pawnshop Industry</p>
<h3>Closed for One Day Yesterday</h3>
<p>More than eighty pawnshops went on strike. Six people were arrested and released on bail that night. A general meeting was held yesterday to actively demand from the Daily News. The employees of the pawnshop industry in this city have long proposed to the capitalists to modify the conditions and improve the treatment, but they have not received a reply. They began to implement the strike yesterday. The patrol room of the concession learned of this, and yesterday morning, they secretly dispatched detectives to patrol everywhere. Those who were encountered persuading the strike were arrested. As a result, a total of six pawnshop employees were arrested. After being released on bail, the employees decided to continue to demand more actively. The situation yesterday is recorded separately as follows: Employee Treatment There are a total of 105 pawnshops in Shanghai, with more than 1,500 employees. The salary and treatment are extremely low. Each pawnshop manager only receives 13 to 15 yuan per month, the head clerk 8 yuan, the second clerk 6 yuan, and the smallest monthly salary for the third clerk is only 3 yuan. The treatment of apprentices and servants is even worse. On December 31, 1927, the employee union signed the treatment conditions with the pawnshop industry association. Recently, due to the increasing cost of living, the employees held the third anniversary of the employee union on July 31 of this year. At that time, a proposal to modify the conditions was unanimously passed and immediately submitted to the Municipal Party Department for approval by the People's Training Committee. On September 1, the pawnshop association was formally presented in writing, but there was no reply for many days. In the first ten days of this month, it was applied again and a deadline was set for a satisfactory reply before the 19th, but the pawnshops still did not take care of it. On the 20th, the pawnshop employee union convened a group leader meeting and decided to close all the stores in Shanghai for one day (the 26th) to hold a general meeting to discuss the final request. Modification of Conditions Article 1 (Recognition) The Pawnshop Industry Association shall recognize that the pawnshop industry employee union has the full power to represent all members. Article 2 (Salary) The salary of each pawnshop employee shall be uniformly stipulated: manager 20 yuan per month, manager of package 19 yuan and 5 cents, money ornaments 19 yuan each, head clerk 18 yuan and 5 cents, second clerk 18 yuan, third clerk 17 yuan and 5 cents, writing account 17 yuan, rolling 16 yuan, clearing ticket 15 yuan, hanging card 14 yuan, student first 13 yuan, student two (12 yuan), student three (11 yuan), student four (10 yuan), student five (9 yuan), student six (8 yuan), servant uniformly 10 yuan, uniformly issue double pay on the 12th. Article 3 (Use) The use of full goods in each pawnshop shall uniformly add one penny, and those who are given the amount according to the current book shall uniformly add 40%. Article 4 (Bonus) Each pawnshop shall announce the annual business status at the end of each year. In addition to the official profit and all expenses in the pawnshop, 30% of the remaining profit shall be allocated to the employees. Article 5 (Counter Interest) Each pawnshop shall stipulate that 3% interest shall be charged for every 1% interest. All those who exceed this number shall be retained. Article 6 (Retention) All subsidies in each pawnshop must still be retained and paid. Article 7 (Vacancy) If there is a vacancy in each pawnshop due to the dismissal of employees or the voluntary resignation of employees, as well as death or vacancy due to illness, the pawnshop employees must be filled in, and no foreigners shall be hired to enter the pawnshop. Article 8 (Dismissal) Employees in each pawnshop shall not be dismissed without major fault. If there is a fault, the trade union must be reported first, but the use and corresponding travel expenses that should be given must be calculated. Article 9 (Closure) If the pawnshop owner closes down and dissolves the employees due to force majeure, the employees must be issued a dissolution fee of 300 yuan, and all use shall be calculated at 10 yuan per frame, according to the existing frame book. Before the closure after the termination, the capitalists shall issue double pay. Article 10 (Working Hours) The daily working hours of employees in each pawnshop shall not exceed nine hours except for New Year's Eve (the time of the day shall be determined according to the custom of the area of each pawnshop). Article 11 (Pension) If an employee in each pawnshop dies due to illness, the capitalist shall give a pension according to the number of years of service. 100 yuan for service within 5 years, 200 yuan for service within 10 years, 300 yuan for service within 15 years, 400 yuan for service within 20 years, 500 yuan for service within 25 years, and uniformly 600 yuan for service beyond 25 years. Those who sacrifice their lives in the course of duty shall be given preferential treatment, and all benefits that should be given shall still be calculated. Article 13 (Insurance) All clothing and articles of employees in each pawnshop shall be insured by the capitalist for 300 taels of silver per person. If the capitalist violates the conditions and does not provide insurance, the number specified in the conditions must be compensated in the event of an accident. Article 14 (Subsidies) Each pawnshop shall subsidize the trade union business expenses by one yuan per month. Article 15 (Holiday Dates) The capitalists of each pawnshop shall abide by the holiday dates stipulated by the government and shall uniformly close their business. Article 16 (Rights) Non-trade union members shall not enjoy all rights under these conditions. Article 17 (Effective Date) Yesterday's Dispute Yesterday morning, more than 80 pawnshop employees, a total of more than 400 people, participated in the conference (because there were more than 700 members in the association, most of them were prevented from joining by the capitalists). A small number of members went out in teams to persuade the strike, but the patrol room of the concession learned about it. Secretly dispatched detectives to patrol everywhere and dispatched many cars to wait at the main traffic arteries to prepare for arresting people. Then, at 11 am, the detectives secretly dispatched by the Songshan Road Patrol Room in front of the Yongqing Pawnshop on Ximen Road in the French Concession arrested Zhu Yu, Wu Yuqing, Xu Zhusheng, Zhan Ping, Yao Bin, and Zhang Wenqi all at once and escorted them to the reserve car and went straight to the patrol room. Afterwards, the employee union sent representatives Cheng Tianfen and Cheng Zhanyun as representatives to negotiate with the Yongqing Pawnshop and provided bail. At 5:30 pm, the Songshan Road Patrol Room agreed to release them. The employee union then sent more than 100 group leaders and deputy group leaders to set off to welcome the arrested workers.</p>
<p>The general meeting resolved that at 10 am yesterday, because there were already more than 400 members present, the representatives of more than 20 groups such as the Bamboo Industry Workers' Union of the Municipal Party Department, the Taikoo Wharf Workers' Union, and the Suzhou Rice Industry Workers' Union also arrived, and the meeting was formally opened. Wang Gan Chen was elected as the chairman, Deng Dunli as the recorder, and after announcing the purpose of the meeting and reporting the plight of the workers, the following proposals were discussed. (1) The proposal to send representatives to negotiate with the capitalists was resolved to send Jin Futian, Wang Gan Chen, Li Fulin, Qiu Bonian, and Cheng Hong as representatives. (2) The proposal to negotiate with the capitalists' trade association in writing in the name of the general meeting of all members was resolved and passed. (3) The proposal to send representatives to petition various party and government agencies was resolved to handle when negotiations failed. (4) The proposal to publish a notice to inform all sectors of the community and give them sympathy and assistance was resolved and passed. (5) The proposal to send representatives to welcome the arrested comrades was resolved and more than 100 group leaders and deputy group leaders set off at 5 pm. (6) How should the small number of members of the capitalists' trade association who manipulate and prevent the progress of the modification of the conditions be dealt with? It was resolved that after searching for conclusive evidence of the names, they should be submitted to the party and government agencies for investigation and handling. One-day closure The pawnshop industry employee union of this city closed all pawnshops in both the Chinese and Concession districts yesterday to hold a membership meeting to discuss all the proceedings of the meeting. All the pawnshop doors were pasted with the words "Membership Meeting Closed for One Day."</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Cocoon Merchants Telegraph the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>Please Strictly Prohibit the Import of Japanese Cocoons. Zhejiang cocoon merchants Jiang Shifang and others telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday: Nanjing, Minister of Finance. The merchants and others previously requested to prohibit the import of Japanese cocoons. According to the report on September 17, your ministry received Instruction No. 3142 from the Executive Yuan to instruct the Jianghai Customs to prohibit the import of all Japanese cocoons to protect national products. After reading it, we deeply admire the maintenance of the livelihood of farmers by your ministry. However, we did not expect that on September 30, we received the approval of your ministry, Guanzi No. 1221, stating that the cocoon harvest this year was poor, which is true. Therefore, temporary relief measures have been stipulated, and there are certain restrictions on the quantity of imports during the tax reduction period. Based on the relief of raw materials for silk factories, it also has the intention of maintaining the national sericulture. Furthermore, on October 4, we received your ministry's decree No. 2081. After consulting the report from the Ministry, we learned that the import of Japanese cocoons should be prohibited. We hereby request the Ministry to consult the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to instruct the Agricultural and Mining Departments and the Construction Department to carefully consider the situation in their respective provinces and report it to the Ministry for further verification and handling. Although the cocoon harvest this year is worse than in previous years, due to the stagnation of silk sales and the closure of silk factories, there is a mountain of cocoons in stock, so there is no shortage of cocoons. Moreover, Japanese cocoons are of inferior quality, and the silk body becomes worse when mixed with Chinese cocoons, and the reputation of Chinese silk is lost. The more silk sales stagnate, the more Chinese sericulture will go bankrupt. Moreover, the foreign silk guild previously sent a letter warning that Japanese cocoons are of rougher quality than Chinese cocoons. If it is proposed to use Japanese cocoons to unwind silk, it will be refused. The Silk Cocoon General Office has notified all silk factories on file and requested that the deceitful merchants be punished for willing to drink poison to quench their thirst. Your ministry should decisively issue a strict order to prohibit the import of Japanese cocoons. We Zhejiang cocoon merchants Jiang Shifang, Zhao Jiexiang, Lu Qinan, Gu Suming, Wang Qingquan, Yu Jinzhong, Bai Sen, Cheng Huilian, etc., respectfully.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cocoon Sales in China are Difficult</h3>
<p>Foreign sales are sluggish, and silk factories are closed. Japanese dried cocoons are shipped to China to provide raw materials for Chinese silk. Zhejiang cocoon merchants telegraphed their opposition. The Ministry of Finance clearly stipulated restrictions on the import of Japanese cocoons, which would not hinder the future of national cocoons. It was still approved to import according to the quota and time limit with reduced taxes to enrich the silk production. It is now known that the sluggish silk sales in Europe and the United States have reached the extreme. Shanghai manufacturers previously used Japanese cocoons to maintain the livelihood of workers due to the shortage of raw materials and to meet the needs of Europe and the United States. At that time, the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silk Cocoon General Office requested the government to reduce the import tax on Japanese cocoons to reduce the silk cost. Recently, the silk market has plummeted, and the price of overseas silk is extremely low. The heavy use of rayon has caused Chinese silk to be ignored. All silk factories in Shanghai have stopped production due to low prices, heavy costs, and huge losses. There is no need for raw materials, and the silk cocoon inventory is full. The resumption of work in each factory is indefinite, so there is no need to purchase Japanese cocoons. Moreover, as silk sales in Europe and the United States are becoming increasingly sluggish, the selling price of Japanese cocoons is not cheap, and the cost is increasing. The factory is even more unwilling to purchase them, so the shipment of Japanese cocoons to China is no longer a problem. Although the Ministry of Finance sympathizes with the merchants' difficulties, it still approves the reduction of taxes on imports, but it is only a mere trace of the past.</p>
<h3>Ma Xiaojun Went to Hong Kong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ma Xiaojun, the director of the Presidium of the Former Military Affairs Committee for Peace in the Two Guang provinces, departed for Hong Kong by ship yesterday morning (the 26th) under the Central Government's orders. He will proceed to Wuzhou to settle the situation in Guangxi. Those who saw him off at the new wharf included Tao Jianhua, the former section chief of the Military Affairs Committee, and over ten others. At this time of national peace and unification, Guangxi Province alone is still engaged in fierce fighting, which is truly not a blessing for the people of the Two Guang provinces. Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, and others, recognizing that Huang Shaoxiong, Bai Chongxi, Li Zongren, Zhang Fakui, and others were all former subordinates of Ma Xiaojun, publicly requested Ma Xiaojun to preside over the peace in the Two Guang provinces, believing it would be more effective. Ma Xiaojun, also concerned about the peace and unification of the party and the nation, readily agreed to come forward and shoulder this great responsibility.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren and Comrades from North and South Yesterday Mourned Hui Youguang</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the memorial service for Mr. Hui Youguang, initiated by Mr. Yu Youren, was held at the Jade Buddha Temple on Binlang Road. The ceremony took place at 11:00 AM. The details of the meeting are recorded as follows: Arrangement of the Venue: The memorial service venue was in the west courtyard of the temple. Hui Youguang's spirit tablet was surrounded by sandalwood incense and adorned with fresh flowers. The Shaanxi students from the various schools in Shanghai, including Datong, Daxia Law School, Political Science, China Public, and Fudan universities, presented a eulogy couplet from Yu Youren, which read: [For the revolution, dying once, life is long; never forgetting the sound that fills heaven and earth. Upholding principles without danger, walking alone until old age; tears wet the Guanhe River.] It was also noted: "When the Jingguo Army disintegrated, Youguang encountered difficulties and sang to express his determination, saying, 'Justice, justice, uphold it and do not move it; you made me live, and I will die for you.'" There were many other eulogies and elegies hanging on the walls. Details of the Ceremony: The third day after Hui Youguang's coffin was buried in Shaanxi, many Northwestern figures in Shanghai came to pay their respects, including Zhou Yaowu, Hu Jingquan, Wang Luyi, Mou Wenqing, Yang Quanjun, Sun Weidong, and Ma Wenyan, as well as Southern comrades such as Zheng Yingbo, Zheng Zhongwu, Wang Juemin, Shi Lei, Liu Kai, and Zhong Chenliang. Several hundred Shaanxi students from Daxia, China Public, Fudan, Political Science, Law, and Art schools in Shanghai attended. Mr. Yu Youren presided over the ceremony, Wang Luyi read the eulogy, and Yang Quanjun and Gou Kejing served as masters of ceremonies. After the ceremony, Mr. Yu gave a very sorrowful speech, and Sun Weidong reported on Hui Youguang's life. The ceremony was extremely solemn and sincere, and photographs were taken to preserve the memory. Hui Youguang's Brief Biography: Hui Youguang, named Siwen, was from Qingjian County, Shaanxi. He was a member of the Chinese Revolutionary Party. Under the order of the Prime Minister, he returned to China from Japan to engage in the Northwestern Revolution. In the sixth year of the Republic, he raised an army of 500 people in northern Shaanxi, known as Mr. Hui's Army. He followed Mr. Yu Youren in the Jingguo campaign, braving dangers and difficulties to assist in the grand plan. In the fifteenth year of the Republic, when Mr. Yu was in charge of the Shaanxi government, Hui Youguang served as the Minister of Political Affairs and was subsequently appointed as a member of the provincial government. At that time, Mr. Hui was in Wuhan, suffering from overwork and illness. He died in Shanghai in the winter of that year. Mr. Yu's Speech: Mr. Yu's speech briefly stated: "It has been three years since the passing of Comrade Youguang. He is now buried in Shaanxi, and we cannot attend the funeral. We can only hold a meeting here to mourn him together. Youguang's life was only about revolution, and he never had a moment of rest or comfort. He always struggled in hardship and suffering. No matter how difficult or dangerous, he always did it resolutely. At that time, all comrades who participated in the revolution recognized his great courage. The reason he was able to be so courageous was because of his firm belief in principles. He was meticulous in all his undertakings, which makes us even more saddened today. It is a pity that his ambitions were not fulfilled and he passed away. However, thinking of the millions of disaster victims in Shaanxi who have died, we still cannot provide any help after the fact. Thinking of the deceased, we are not only heartbroken but also extremely guilty. The only way forward is to continue our efforts." Eulogy: "On the twenty-sixth day of October in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, more than three years after the passing of Mr. Hui Youguang, he was finally reburied in Qingjian County, Shaanxi on the twenty-third day of the month. Yu Youren and his comrades respectfully offer this humble incense and sacrifice in Shanghai from afar, saying: Alas, although Lan Cheng is old, he still has his hometown to summon his soul and shed tears of mourning. What is shared is the heart and blood, what is separated is the mountains and rivers. May the world be free from difficulties, and may the remnants of the people survive! Looking westward and sighing deeply, offering the sword to the tree at the grave, mourning the long journey home."</p>

<p>"Oh, to the mighty Yangtze, flowing tonight. A heroic farewell to a life of revolution that is now over. Having first crossed the sea to join the alliance, encountering the great bandit's shift of loyalty. Commanded to return and rush to the Northwest. Although often harassed by enemy scouts, ultimately rallying followers to kill the traitors. Forming comrades in life and death, pointing to sincerity as the guiding principle. The elders of Guanzhong now remember the soldiers of the gentleman. The dust and sand on the border, people point to the bones of their families. When the Shaanxi Jingguo Army rose, you generously raised troops and made oaths, valuing Mr. Hui's one-day of knowledge like the five hundred soldiers of Tian Heng. You said that Tongguan was dangerous and should cut off eastern aid, so you packed food in Shangshan and arrived day and night. On the battlefield, isolated and outnumbered, the mountain curves and the water bends, the party affairs and military affairs are far away across the Jing and Wei rivers, in a state of distress. Bound in yellow, singing of justice, forgetting oneself. Daring to change what was intended, alas! In the hundred battles in Qin, the grass fell without resistance, without a year to live. Where does the spring water of each year flow for mulberry cultivation? Owls destroy houses, jackals and tigers rely on the city. People die in their homes, and wild cries are in vain. You traveled south and north, responding to consultations, patrolling down to Lin Shengqiu. The garrison defending Chang'an resists the killing. The siege of the city has been long, and the stars of the Big Dipper are rising. Suffering from illness, what can be done against the depth of the enemy? Mourning the dead and supporting the wounded, the dark clouds suddenly clear, and the blue sky and white sun return. Returning to proclaim the doctrine, stirring up wind and thunder. Receiving a new mandate, excited, blocked by the Jianghan River, wandering in the old land, thinking deeply. As if someone is in the corner of the mountain, driving the Hua Mountain, wanting to run, but the water of the Yellow River will not return. The light is extinguished, the shadow is gone, the heart is broken and crushed. With the pure heart of a vegetarian, where on earth is one like you? The coffin is late in returning, and the burial date is delayed again. The border is filled with sad winds, and sincerity is conveyed by walking. Your spirit looks back, may the people be revived and not be far away. Alas, come here!"</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Joint Meeting of Rice Associations</h3>
<p>The 13th regular meeting of the Joint Association of Rice Industry Associations of Jiangsu, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other cities and counties was held at Cuixiu Hall at 3:00 PM yesterday. The committee members who attended included Ye Huijun, Zhao Zixin, Chen Junyu, Zhu Zixiang, and fourteen others. Ye Huijun was publicly elected as chairman, and the ceremony was conducted as usual. Representatives from various counties reported on the abundant harvest this year. It was estimated that the total increase in production within Jiangsu Province could reach over 20 million dan (石), ensuring that the common people would not have to worry about food shortages. Subsequently, the representative from Wuxi proposed that the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining establish an agricultural product inspection office to inspect wheat. However, the situation in Wuxi was different, and there were many obstacles to implementation. They requested that the proposal be forwarded to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining for consideration. It was resolved to forward the proposal immediately. Next, the chairman reported that the Rice Industry Association of Wujiang County had sent a letter the previous day stating that the Pingwang Rice Inspection Office had forcibly detained rice boats, accusing them of smuggling. They had already telegraphed the Wujiang County government for assistance. Today, they received another letter from the Pingwang rice merchants stating that all the rice had been unloaded, but the boats had not yet been released. The question was how to handle this matter. It was resolved to telegraph the county again, urging them to investigate and handle the matter impartially. Additionally, it was resolved that Committee Member Mi Ganqing, who had resigned due to illness, should be unanimously persuaded to stay because of his enthusiasm for the association's affairs and his significant contributions. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM as the clock struck.</p>
<h3>Dedicated Dock for Bean and Rice Industry</h3>

The ceremony proceeded as usual. Chairman Ye Huijun delivered a speech, stating that the rice industry is a major business in Shanghai. It has undergone many changes over the decades. Now, under the leadership of the municipal government and the Social Affairs Bureau, our members should strive to improve and benefit the people and businesses. Therefore, the construction of the rice dock is only a preliminary step. In the future, we should continue to work together to ensure the safety of our industry. Zhu Zixiang then gave a brief report on the construction's income and expenses. Following this, Section Chief Feng delivered a speech, stating that food is a major problem for human life. If food is properly managed, people can live in peace. He was very happy to be able to participate in the grand ceremony today to celebrate the completion of the rice dock built by the rice industry for the sake of people's livelihood and to offer his congratulations to the rice industry and praise to society. He hoped that the rice industry would continue to show the same enthusiasm and build more facilities for the rice industry, such as warehouses, etc. The Social Affairs Bureau, in order to promote the development and safety of society, will definitely provide more assistance to matters related to the people's food supply in the future, so that merchants and the public can benefit from it. Subsequently, Jin Sheng of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce stated that the members of the rice industry have a spirit of courage and have worked together to build a large-scale rice dock. The development of the rice industry in Shanghai in the future depends on the members of the rice industry having perfect facilities.

<p>Fruit and Produce Business</p>
<h3>Requesting the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Discuss the Settlement Period</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fruit and Produce Industry Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, we received your letter stating that from this year onwards, we should follow the national calendar and settle accounts at the end of the year (omitted). We should strictly follow government orders, but in the past, at the end of May and September, many debtors made excuses. Although it is difficult to reverse the accumulated habits, it is also because our country's agriculture is the basis for people's buying and selling, and we have to rely on the harvest of agricultural products. Therefore, in the past two settlements, all our merchants suffered difficulties. Now, to settle accounts at the end of the national calendar year, we are notified in advance to prepare. It is difficult to violate the government orders, but observing the domestic commercial situation, the economy has already fallen into bankruptcy. Based on this, if we still encounter the same difficulties as in the past two times when we close accounts on time, then the receivables and payables will still be blocked, forming a stalemate and a dangerous situation. Such government orders are no less than a death warrant for merchants. If we say that we should reform and innovate and work hard to do so, then our merchants have never lagged behind others, but we have to seriously consider the settlement period, which is related to life, in order to avoid difficulties for both the upper and lower levels. We have learned that merchants in the bean and rice industry and the rice milling industry have made suggestions regarding the settlement to the authorities, and they have been rejected. However, the government emphasizes government orders, and the matter concerns the general public. It is difficult to get the authorities to adopt the opinions of only one or two people. We cannot keep silent because of the rejection. The current plan seems to be to gather opinions or convene a meeting of member representatives to discuss together to collect thoughts and benefit from it, so as to get a clear hearing and comply with the commercial situation. We dare to send this letter to your association, hoping that you will consider and approve it, so as to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants. We respectfully ask for a reply." Sincerely, Shanghai Fruit and Produce Industry Association, October 26, the 19th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Transportation Industry Temporarily Suspends Tianjin-Pukou Railway Freight</h3>
<p>Due to the issue of the Xuzhou Station allocating cars, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Xuzhou Station Transportation Company issued an important notice stating: "Respectfully, the Xuzhou area has been affected by the situation, and freight cars have stopped. Commercial transport is difficult. Now that the military affairs have ended, freight transport can gradually flow. Since the arrival of the 290 train and the 580 train on the 20th of this month, the Xuzhou Station has not followed the regulations of the railway bureau and has not allocated cars according to the license plate number. Our industry has been greatly disappointed and unfairly treated. In addition to sending a telegram to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau to send personnel to Xuzhou to conduct a fair and thorough investigation, we hereby publish a statement that before the railway bureau gives a satisfactory reply in the future, our industry will unanimously and resolutely suspend Tianjin-Pukou railway freight and switch to Longhai for loading. We specially declare this and hope for your understanding."</p>
<h3>New Kang Family Association Requests Relief</h3>
<p>Based on the resolution of the Executive Committee on the 20th of this month, the New Kang Ship Disaster Family Association of the China Merchants Bureau sent an official letter to Director-General Li of the China Merchants Bureau, requesting Minister Wang of the Ministry of Transportation to grant material relief so that the victims and their families could avoid hunger and cold. The letter is excerpted and recorded as follows: Letter to Director-General Li (omitted). "Respectfully, according to the committee meeting on October 20th, the committee members unanimously agreed that the victims' families are in financial difficulty and struggling to make a living. They have come to the association one after another requesting assistance, which is very pitiful. It is difficult to remain indifferent during difficult times. It was resolved to request your bureau to lend funds to provide assistance. The loan will be repaid in full after the negotiation is resolved. As for the amount, please allocate as much as your bureau can afford. We dare to submit this case to you and hope that you will understand and take pity on us, and approve our request. The poor birds in the barren forest will receive endless benefits. Your high-mindedness and profound feelings will be remembered by both the living and the dead. We respectfully ask for your kind regards." Document sent to the Ministry of Transportation: "Document for requesting relief and requesting approval for filing. We have learned that the case of the China Merchants Bureau's New Kang ship being sunk by the Japanese post office's Ryuya Maru has been dragging on for years without resolution. The dead harbor injustice in the sea, and the living bear pain in the world. The injustice has not been cleared, and the depression is difficult to express. What is more tragic and painful in the world than this? Now, a year has easily passed, and winter is coming. The disaster-stricken families in Shanghai all feel that it is difficult to live in Chang'an with every inch of gold and land. It is not easy to make a living with expensive firewood and rice. Therefore, they have come to the association one after another requesting assistance. After the committee meeting discussed, the committee members unanimously agreed that the victims' families are struggling to make a living, and they have nowhere to turn for help. Their plight is indeed real. It was resolved to borrow funds from the China Merchants Bureau to provide assistance. The loan will be repaid in full when the negotiation is resolved in the future and will never be delayed. As for the amount of the loan, please have the China Merchants Bureau act according to its ability and do as much as possible. In addition to sending a letter to Director-General Li of the China Merchants Bureau, we should jointly report to the ministry for filing, approval, and transfer order to the China Merchants Bureau to approve the request, and immediately implement it. We are extremely grateful. We respectfully submit this to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Transportation."</p>
<h3>Ningbo Association Discussed the Xin Case Yesterday</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Convene a Joint Meeting. The Ningbo Association specially convened an executive committee meeting yesterday to discuss the handling of the Xin Dingxiang tragedy. It has been resolved to convene a joint meeting of various hometown associations on November 1st to discuss joint external negotiations.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Civil Training Association Suspends the Activities of Three Medical and Pharmaceutical Organizations</h3>
<p>They should be merged immediately and join the Chinese Medicine Association. The Municipal People's Training Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department recently received a letter from the Executive Committee of the Fifth District stating that the names and organizations of the Shenzhou Medical and Pharmaceutical Association, the Chinese Medicine Association, and the Chinese Medical and Pharmaceutical Federation are bizarre and their organizations are not in compliance with regulations. They requested that they be ordered to merge and reorganize. After investigation, it has been confirmed that they are indeed not in compliance. Yesterday, an order was issued to the organizations, stating: "In order to comply with the matter, according to the letter from the Executive Committee of the Fifth District, the Tenth Branch of the district has submitted that the names and organizations of the Shenzhou Medical and Pharmaceutical Association, the Chinese Medicine Association, and the Chinese Medical and Pharmaceutical Federation are bizarre and their organizations are not in compliance with regulations. They requested that they be ordered to merge and reorganize. Please investigate and handle the matter. After investigation, it has been confirmed that the organizations of the associations are indeed not in compliance. In addition to issuing separate orders, we urgently order the associations to immediately stop their activities, merge, and join the Chinese Medicine Association to comply with the laws and regulations. Do not violate this order."</p>
<h3>Public Concession Authorities Strive to Carry Out Gambling Prohibition</h3>
<p>Requesting the Cooperation of Consuls of Various Countries. The Continental Daily reported that the Public Concession authorities are now paying great attention to the issue of gambling in the concession, hoping to eliminate bad habits. They are currently requesting the consuls of various countries to cooperate. It is reported that the Chinese authorities and the Japanese consul are willing to do their best to assist. In addition, several other consuls have also informally expressed their support for the gambling prohibition. The Municipal Council is now planning to start by thoroughly investigating the gambling situation and seeking the opinions of the entire consular body in order to gather ideas and determine the easiest and most effective way to gradually eliminate the gambling trend. A reporter from the Continental Daily met with Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, yesterday. He said that suicides and major crimes in the city have been occurring frequently recently and have been increasing month by month. Therefore, he believes that it is now necessary to prohibit gambling. He expects that the Municipal Council will soon take measures to reduce the number of gambling licenses issued and will strictly supervise the licensed gambling establishments. Yesterday, the Japanese newspaper's report on the opinions of senior police officers on the gambling prohibition was incorrect, and the character "法" (law) should be "訪" (visit). The police force referred to is the Public Concession police force, and this is hereby corrected.</p>

<h3>Tea Room Workers' Union Requests Correction of Tea Room Management Rules</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Tea Room Workers' Union, noting that the recently drafted "Unified Management Rules for Ningbo Shipping Tea Rooms" by the China Merchants, Ningshao, and Sanbei Companies contained many inappropriate clauses, specially submitted a request to the Social Bureau yesterday for corrections. The original text is as follows: A submission concerning the harsh content of the "Unified Management Rules for Ningbo Shipping Tea Rooms" drafted by the China Merchants, Ningshao, and Sanbei Companies, which will shackle the workers, we hereby truthfully report and request your examination and speedy correction to alleviate the workers' hardships. It is found that the three companies are drafting unified management rules for Ningbo shipping tea rooms, which the union agrees with in principle for rectification purposes. However, several points are considered in need of consideration and correction. The reasons for modifying each clause are detailed below. According to Rule 2 [The number of tea room staff on each ship of this company/bureau will temporarily follow the current number, but may be increased or decreased at any time depending on the complexity of the work on each ship.] This clause stipulates that the number of tea room staff will temporarily follow the current number, but adding the phrase "may be increased or decreased at any time" is contradictory. Moreover, the employer can use this to arbitrarily dismiss union members who are enthusiastic about union affairs or add non-members, directly causing panic in the workers' lives and indirectly affecting the union's affairs. This is the first point that should be corrected. Rule 5 [Each tea server on the ship should provide a sufficient guarantee or pay a deposit.] Tea room staff are manual laborers and do not have the ability to pay a deposit. If they are forced to pay, they will inevitably borrow from the east and west, increasing their interest burden. If the tea room staff's burden is heavy, then demanding tips becomes an unavoidable reality. Therefore, the union believes that finding a guarantor is acceptable, but requiring them to pay a deposit is not. This is the second point that should be corrected. Item D of Rule 7 [Serving passengers and ship staff]. The tea room staff's job is to serve passengers. As for the ship's staff, they all have hired servants, so there is no need to use the tea room staff for their errands and increase their workload. This is the third point that should be corrected. Item C of Rule 9 [No soliciting of tips]. Tea room staff are unpaid workers, and their only means of livelihood is a small amount of tips. Therefore, tea room staff have a legitimate right to the stipulated tips. If passengers are stingy and do not give them, they can ask for them as needed. Therefore, the union believes that not allowing extortion or excessive demands is acceptable, but not allowing solicitation is not. This is the fourth point that should be corrected. Also, Item E of the same rule [No gathering to cause trouble]. The union believes that this item is intended by the employer to secretly undermine the unity of the workers. This is the fifth point that should be corrected. Rule 11 [Passenger tips shall be in accordance with the ministry's order, with one-tenth of the ticket price as the standard.] Since tips are stipulated by the ministry's order, they should be strictly followed. However, it is found that Article 2 of the ministry's order also stipulates [The ship's tea servers should be given wages and food.] The Ministry of Communications knows that the current living standards are high and that the tips of one-tenth of the ticket price are not enough to maintain a living. Therefore, after limiting the tips, it also ordered the company to provide tea room staff with wages and food. However, the companies only know how to comply with the ministry's order to stipulate tips, while ignoring the provision of wages and food. How harsh is their treatment? Moreover, the Sanbei Company has a long-standing evil practice of extracting huge surcharges from the Ningshing ship tea room staff (i.e., the company must extract a tip of one dime to four dimes for each passenger served by each tea room staff). Now, there has been no movement to abolish it, and on the one hand, they want to limit tips, which is extremely absurd. To comply with the ministry's order, the steerage fare is five dimes, and the tip should be five cents. Now, the Sanbei Company must extract one dime. According to this situation, the tea room staff's income is five cents, while the amount paid to the company is one dime. If they want to solicit, they will commit the crime of extortion. Otherwise, they will not only have no income but also have to pay out of pocket. If this is the case, then those who want to work as Ningbo shipping tea room staff in the future will have to sell their wives and properties. Therefore, before the surcharge and food money are abolished and the wages and food are not stipulated, it is impossible to limit tips. This is the sixth point that should be corrected. For the sake of the workers' livelihood and to uphold justice, the union has no choice but to truthfully report and request your examination and speedy correction to alleviate the suffering and hardships of the workers. We respectfully submit with utmost urgency. There is also local news transferred to the following page.</p>

<p>Strange Incident</p>
<h3>Husband Orders Wife to Jump into Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Fang Zuhong Forgets Hard Times, Su Sulan Rescued and Survives. Yesterday around 11:00 AM, near the Swatow Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession, a woman from Anhui was abandoned by her husband and attempted to drown herself in the river. Fortunately, the water police at the scene managed to rescue her and prevent her from drowning. Because the woman resided in the Chinese territory, she was immediately transferred to the Second District General Station of the Public Security Bureau and then to the Local Women's Association for care. The detailed account is recorded as follows: Widower and Widow. Fang Zuhong, a 35-year-old man from Ningbo, previously worked for the Swatow Shipping Company. Both his parents were alive and well. Six years ago, his first wife passed away from illness. At the time, Fang's ship was sailing along the Yangtze River. On one occasion, he passed by Wuhu and happened to find that a certain official of the Public Security Bureau there had passed away, leaving behind a widow, Su Sulan. Su was also a respected lady from Wuhu, only 27 years old, who had become a widow early in life. Because Su was living alone as a widow, her life was becoming increasingly difficult, so she intended to remarry. Fang Zuhong, a recent widower, was eager to remarry. So, both parties officially married through a matchmaker. Not long after, Fang was suddenly reported and accused of ticket fraud, and the Wuhu court interrogated him several times. He was about to be sentenced to imprisonment. Su pawned all her clothes and jewelry, intending to redeem her husband's crime. After experiencing many hardships, Fang was found to have committed a crime with conclusive evidence. Su pleaded with the plaintiff, but was refused. Su then became so angry that she wanted to end her life by jumping into the river, but was rescued. The plaintiff then took pity on her sincerity and agreed to drop the charges, and Fang was spared from punishment. In March of the year before last, Fang and Su moved to Shanghai. Not long after, Fang returned to his position as the second comprador on the Swatow Shipping Company's Daming ship. Having enough food and warmth, he became lustful. After the two moved to Shanghai, they initially lived peacefully. However, in the past two years, Fang suddenly changed his behavior, indulged in gambling and opium, and completely neglected Su. Even her food and clothing were cut off. Su, unable to bear it any longer, filed a petition with the Shanghai Women's Association on April 12th, calling for assistance. After repeated mediation by friends, Fang only agreed to provide a monthly allowance of eight yuan for living expenses, but he never paid it in full. Husband Orders Wife to Jump into the River. Su became overly stimulated and nearly became insane. The Daming ship arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and was scheduled to depart for Dalian yesterday. Yesterday around 11:00 AM, Su went to the wharf to ask Fang for living expenses. Fang not only refused to pay but also verbally abused Su and ordered her to jump into the river and commit suicide as soon as possible. Su, helpless at the time, followed her husband's order and jumped into the river. Fortunately, she was rescued and did not die. The water police heard the news and rushed to rescue her, bringing her back to life. She was taken to the Da Zi Ming Zhong police station. After a brief questioning by the chief, Su was sent to the Second District General Station of the Public Security Bureau because she lived at No. 10 Fangxie Road, Nanshi, which was under the jurisdiction of the Second District General Station of the Public Security Bureau. After Wang, the district chief, questioned her, Su confessed that she was a member of the Women's Association. The Second District was ordered to send her to the association for temporary care, pending the return of her husband, Fang Zuhong, to Shanghai, when he would be ordered to take her back and provide for her properly.</p>
<h3>Woman Sues for Resumption of Marriage</h3>
<p>The Case is Bizarre and Interesting. This Morning, the Court Opened the Trial. Fang Zixiang, a man from Anhui who lived at No. 3 Sanyi Lane, Fangbang Road in the city, married Cheng as his second wife in the 33rd year of the Guangxu reign. After the marriage, they lived harmoniously and had two sons, the elder named Jialin and the younger named Amao. In the second year of the Republic of China, Cheng did not abide by the way of a wife. Zixiang was a businessman and did not know anything about it. Unexpectedly, Cheng suddenly took the younger son Amao and disappeared. Zixiang searched everywhere but could not find them. In October of the fifth year of the Republic of China, Cheng suddenly led a group of hooligans to force Zixiang to write a divorce letter, stipulating that the four-year-old younger son could take another surname and not be interfered with. Zixiang, fearing their fierce momentum and the scandal, personally wrote a note and handed it over to Cheng. From then on, they had nothing to do with each other. After more than a year, Zixiang learned that Cheng had married a man named Bao and had also changed Zixiang's younger son Amao to the surname Bao, renaming him Qiquan. He was studying at Chengzhong School and graduated last year. He is now working as a clerk in the Customs Superintendent's Office. Since Cheng remarried to Bao, she also had a daughter and rented a house at No. 227 Menghua Street in the city. She also reported the household registration under the name of Bao. Unexpectedly, Bao's investment business failed greatly this year, so he absconded, abandoning his family and neglecting his support. For the sake of living, Cheng thought of her ex-husband Fang Zixiang and asked to resume the marriage. Zixiang refused to reconcile because she had voluntarily abandoned him and they were no longer together. Cheng then requested to remarry and live together with Zixiang and sued the Shanghai Local Court, citing her willingness to divorce and asking to be allowed to resume the marriage in order to live together until old age. It is said that the case is scheduled to open at 9:00 AM today (the 27th). Both parties have hired lawyers and there will be a vigorous debate.</p>

<h3>Wandering and Crying on the Way</h3>
<p>Father Joyfully Surprised After Returning Home. Kidnapping Gang Awaits Sentencing. Xu Desheng and Hu Chenzhi from Shandong, because they gathered a gang with weapons to kidnap Zhou Hankun's six-year-old son Fusheng from the Zhou Sanhe crate shop he opened at No. 149 Alcok Road on the evening of September 3, sent a letter demanding a ransom of 2,000 yuan. After the incident, Hua Detective Li Pengfei from Huishan Police Station arrested Xu and Hu one after another on Yangzhou Road and other places, but the whereabouts of the kidnapped child were unknown and the case was handed over to the Special District Court for investigation. Until around 4:00 AM on the 18th of last month, Mao Rengui, a man from Ningbo who lived at No. 4 Tangshan Road, went out to the Triangle Vegetable Market to buy vegetables and saw a child wandering and crying by the roadside. He asked the child, who cleverly replied that his name was Zhou Fusheng and his father's name was Lao Jiangxi, who opened a crate shop on Zhoujiazui Road. Mao learned that there was only one Zhou Sanhe crate shop on that road, so he took the Zhou child home. He still went to buy vegetables before returning home. He then went to Zhou Sanhe and informed the child's father, Zhou Hankun, who was overjoyed when he heard the news. He quickly went to Mao's house to identify the child and found that it was indeed his son. He thanked Mao in every way and took his son back. The case was interrogated by Judge Ge Zhiqin the other day. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case and said that the witnesses and the child involved in the case had arrived in court today and asked to be interrogated. He then presented a ransom letter for inspection. Li Bao Detective then complained about the detection situation and said that the kidnapped child had also been found on the 18th. He then ordered the child to go to the police station to identify Xu Desheng among the many prisoners as the person who had taken him to the bandit's den. Zhou Hankun also claimed that he was not present at the time of the incident, so he did not witness it. The child Fusheng said that he was taken out by Xu Desheng at that time, Xu had a gun, Hu Chenzhi was not seen, and two other bandits were traveling with them. Later, an old man dragged me to the road and threw me away. Later, Mao Rengui took me home, etc. Mao Rengui also proved everything. Jiang Hanzhong, Wan Jinsheng, and Fu Lisheng, partners of the Zhou Sanhe Crate Shop, successively proved that four people came together at that time. Xu Desheng first broke in, held a gun, and threatened to first take away a gold ring from the owner's daughter's hand and then took the young master out. Hu was watching the wind in the patio, etc. When questioned, Xu Desheng confessed that the escaped Wang surname had initiated the idea and Hu had also gone. I did not carry a gun. The child was taken out by an accomplice and later sent to Hu's house by someone else, etc. Hu Chenzhi completely denied it. Judge Ge verified the confession and, under the defense of the lawyer, ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody pending sentencing on a scheduled date.</p>
<h3>Gentry Petition to Preserve Gelao Lane</h3>
<p>Eight gentry from Shanghai, Ma Liang, Wang Zhen, Yao Wennan, Ye Jingliang, Di Xitian, Zhu Kaijia, Lu Bohong, and Xi Yuanliang, petitioned the Ministry of Interior of the National Government to instruct the Shanghai Municipal Government to order the Public Works Bureau to preserve the Gelao Lane in Shanghai, which is related to famous officials and historical sites, in order to respect the predecessors. The original text is recorded as follows: We believe that preserving historical sites is necessary for collecting literature and historical examination, and respecting local sages implies inspiring integrity and promoting justice. Xu Guangqi, a Grand Scholar of the Ming Dynasty, rose from the Hanlin Academy to the position of Deputy Minister and became an advisor to the emperor. He was upright and did not attach himself to powerful eunuchs. He was erudite and wrote extensively. He worked with Western missionary Matteo Ricci to measure astronomy, revise the calendar, and study border defense, river works, agricultural administration, machinery, and firearms. He wrote specialized books such as Ruzong Renbiao. His plaque is enshrined in the county and township shrines, and he is famous both at home and abroad. Europeans and Americans especially admire him. The History of the Ming Dynasty has a biography of him. The old Shanghai county seat and the existing Gelao Lane, which was built by imperial decree, was founded at the end of the Ming Dynasty and completed in the early Qing Dynasty. For 300 years, it has been managed by the Xu family, who paid the land tax with vouchers, which are recorded in the Jiangnan Tongzhi and the prefectural and county records. The stone lane is a private building, and the lane base is not public land. Even the Manchus, who entered China, knew to order local officials to protect it. Recently, we heard that the Shanghai Public Works Bureau believes that the lane is dangerous and hinders the road. It has submitted a request to the municipal government to approve its demolition as soon as possible. The Xu family lane merchants were shocked and ran around calling for help. Local gentry also believe that Mr. Xu was a mentor of new politics and new ideals, a well-known Confucian scholar both at home and abroad. Destroying his historical site would cause public outrage. We have found that the Ministry of Education has issued an order to preserve all historical sites in the locality. Xu's Gelao Lane is the only historical site of a famous official in Shanghai, which is in line with the Ministry's order. Even if it is incomplete, dilapidated, and dangerous, local officials should supervise the descendants of the Xu family to repair it to avoid collapse. It should not be destroyed due to a minor problem. If it is said to hinder the route, there are uneven houses inside and outside the city and numerous stone lanes lining the streets. It is not easy to rectify it all at once. Moreover, we have found that various countries in Europe and America never demolish historical sites to build roads. They either build another road to facilitate traffic or enclose the historical site in the center, with vehicles and horses traveling on both sides. The United States and France have set a good example. We dare to jointly submit a petition requesting that your superiors examine and approve the request to instruct the Shanghai Municipal Government to order the Public Works Bureau to withdraw its decision to demolish the 300-year-old Gelao Lane, which is related to cultural history, and allow it to be preserved in order to respect the local sages and comply with public opinion. This would be a virtuous and convenient act.</p>
<h3>Notice to Remitters in Various Places</h3>
<p>Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Notice. Must Specify Fuzhou Road. Shanghai Postal Commission Industry Bureau's public letter to all sectors of the community: We hereby inform you that, in order to facilitate the convenience of check deposit users, all postal remittances remitted to Shanghai from various places for those who have opened check savings accounts in our bureau can be sent to our bureau for account entry without having to go to various post offices to withdraw cash. Since the implementation of this measure, merchants have found it convenient. The reason for seeking benefits for deposit users is truly meticulous. However, the internal handling procedures of our bureau have increased as a result. If the verification of incoming remittances is directly sent to our bureau, the handling can be swift. However, many remitters in various places are unaware of this relationship and only remit the money to Shanghai without specifying Fuzhou Road. Therefore, the verification is often sent to other bureaus at random. Our bureau approaches these remittances either by searching for verification from other bureaus or by requesting them to transfer the remittance, which is cumbersome and requires a separate transfer of accounts. Now, the number of large companies in Shanghai coming to our bureau to open check savings accounts is increasing day by day, and the number of postal remittances sent for deposit every day is also increasing. If we do not strive for convenience in the procedures, the influx of these remittances will be difficult to handle. For this reason, we have written this letter to inform you that in the future, when your office communicates with remitters in various places or publishes advertisements, please inform the remitters to declare to the post office when remitting money that the ticket must be paid at the Fuzhou Road Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau in Shanghai, and to check whether the word Fuzhou Road is marked on the remittance ticket. Such clear designation will save trouble and speed up the payment of the ticket in the future. Sincerely,</p>
<h3>Colleagues of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Mourn Wang Shicong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 26th) at 9:00 AM, colleagues of the Municipal Public Security Bureau held a memorial service for Wang Shicong, a police squad drill instructor, at the Xiaoximen Youth Propaganda Group. Mr. Yu Junxiang of Changsha had studied at the Guangzhou Xiang Army Military Academy. During the Northern Expedition in the past, Mr. Wang served as an adjutant and staff officer, assisting in military affairs and earning the praise of his superiors. In the 16th year, after the recovery of Beiping, the military affairs came to an end. Mr. Wang resolutely retired from the army and entered the Police Department of the Central Military Academy Military Officer Research Class to study police administration. This year, he was ordered to be assigned to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for an internship. After the expiration of his internship, he was appointed as a police squad drill instructor. He had been doing a good job since taking office. Unexpectedly, he suddenly died in a car accident while training police officers. The situation was very tragic. The colleagues of the Public Security Bureau are holding this event to commemorate his enthusiasm for his duties.</p>
<h3>Portrait of Mr. Wang Shicong</h3>
<p>He died on duty, hence the special initiation of this meeting. Those who attended on this day included internal and external staff of the bureau and police representatives, as well as hundreds of Mr. Yu's friends. Director Yuan was unable to attend due to business, so Section Chief Xu of the First Section acted as chairman. At the beginning of the meeting, Zhou, the deputy captain of the police squad, reported on Mr. Wang's life. Then, the chairman gave a speech on the significance of the meeting. Then, the representative of the Whampoa Alumni Association and Mr. Zhang Junpu delivered speeches one after another. The speeches of the gentlemen were extremely sad and sincere, so the listeners were all moved. The surrounding of the altar and the drum tower in the middle were covered with elegiac couplets. There were more than a hundred sacrificial offerings, which were dazzling and beautiful. Here are only Director Yuan's plaque and one couplet: The plaque reads [Diligent in Duty to the Death]. The couplet reads [A hundred refinements produce fine gold, a needle pierces through the bag to reveal its point, nine guards lament the overturned cart, pouring out one's heart to reward Lige's heart]</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Shanghai Women's Temperance Society</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Temperance Society is making every effort to promote temperance recently. Ms. Yang Meizhen, director of the society's propaganda department, has personally gone to various places to give lectures.

<h3>Motorized Bicycle Accident Injures People</h3>
<p>Three Westerners Injured at the Same Time. Last Saturday night, a motorized bicycle accident occurred at the intersection of the Bund and Fuzhou Road. The injured included Mr. Bartlett Gordon, a land surveyor for the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession, Mr. Brower Stone, a Western police officer at the vehicle affairs office of the police station, and Mr. Rochon Furs, a Western police officer at the French Concession police station. Except for Mr. Rochon, whose injuries were minor, Mr. Bauer and Mr. Robb are currently being treated at the General Hospital for their injuries, which are worrying, especially Mr. Bauer's injuries, which are even more serious. The time of the accident was around 11:40 PM. Mr. Bartlett was walking on the Bund near Fuzhou Road, intending to cross the Bund from west to east. Unexpectedly, at this time, a motorized bicycle No. 337, carrying Mr. Brower and Mr. Robb, was driving from north to south. Mr. Bauer was unable to avoid it and was knocked to the ground. The two people on the car were also thrown to the side of the road at the same time. However, the car engine had not yet stopped. Mr. Bartlett was taken by the car to a distance of four feet and suffered serious injuries. Fortunately, Western Police Officer No. 303 happened to see it and stepped forward to rescue him. With the help of two British soldiers, Mr. Bauer and Mr. Robb were sent to the General Hospital for treatment. Among them, Mr. Rochon Furs, a Western police officer at the French Concession police station, was slightly injured because he was sitting in the back of the car. He was treated by a doctor and then returned. When Mr. Bauer and Mr. Robb arrived at the hospital, they were both unconscious and their condition was worrying.</p>
<p>Zhang Weiru's Daughter</p>
<h3>Swallowed Lysol and Committed Suicide</h3>
<p>Because of persistent illness, she committed this act. Zhang Weiru, a Jiaxing native living at No. 88 Changfu Lane, Kader Road in the Public Concession (Chairman of the Gold Exchange), had a daughter named Tian Ruinian, who was 24 years old. She was proficient in Chinese and Western languages and had graduated from a famous girls' school at sea. She is currently employed at the Guohua Bank on Ningbo Road. Because of a nasal disease that made breathing difficult for a long time, she swallowed Lysol in the bathroom at her home around 5:00 PM yesterday. When she was discovered, she was immediately taken to Baolong Hospital for treatment by car. Because the rescue was too late, she died shortly after.</p>
<h3>Follow-up on the Case of Dereliction of Duty by the Water Patrol Captain</h3>
<p>Patrol officers and others have nothing to do with it. Xu Yan, the former captain of the Water Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was detained for dereliction of duty and has been sent to the Local Court for legal processing. The details have been recorded in this newspaper twice. However, the report said that the patrol officers and weekly patrol chiefs also knew about the case and had all fled after the incident, which is not true. It is said that after the case occurred, the patrol officers and patrol chiefs of the team were still safely serving in the team because they had nothing to do with it.</p>
<h3>Woman Accuses Husband of Remarrying</h3>
<p>The result of the trial is that the defendant is innocent. A woman, Mao Yang Xiuying, recently hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint in the Special District Local Court against her husband, Mao Shouhai (32 years old, a local who opened a Hengsheng Grocery Store at No. 346 Yangshupu Road), and the woman Huang Amei for abandonment. The complaint stated that the plaintiff married the defendant Mao Shouhai in January of the eighth year of the Republic of China. After the marriage, their relationship was still strong and they had a daughter who is now nine years old. Unexpectedly, the defendant suddenly changed his behavior last summer and knew that the plaintiff's personality was very weak and regarded her as a thorn in his side, often scolding her and refusing to provide support. Although she negotiated with him, it was ineffective because the husband was fierce and powerful. She had to work to make a living and foster her daughter in her mother's house in the hope that her husband would realize his mistake and restore the relationship between husband and wife. However, the defendant not only did not realize his mistake but also sold all of the plaintiff's clothes and jewelry, opened a shop, and remarried Huang Amei as his formal wife. When the plaintiff learned of this on October 2, she went to the shop to question him. The defendant immediately said, "I have remarried and you are not allowed in the shop." He then instigated Huang Amei to beat her and drive her out. However, the plaintiff and the defendant only had a quarrel and had not severed their relationship. The defendant's actions clearly violated Articles 254 and 310 of the Criminal Law and should be punished according to the law. The court approved the complaint and ordered the defendant to be notified on the morning of the previous day. The case was heard by Judge Sun Yuan in the Second Criminal Court. The defendant Huang Amei did not appear because she could not be found. Judge Sun then ruled that the defendant Mao Shouhai was declared innocent and the Huang Amei stopped the trial proceedings.</p>
<h3>Girl, Unable to Bear Abuse, Jumps into River</h3>
<p>Whether or not there is a stepmother is a question. She will be sent to the court for interrogation today. At 7:50 PM the night before last, a young girl boarded the No. 12 ferry at the Chunjiang Wharf in Lujiazui, Pudong, and attempted to commit suicide by jumping into the river when the boat reached the center of the river. She was rescued by the ferry captain Tong Fuquan and sent to the Water Patrol Station. She confessed that her name was Zhang Afu, she was 16 years old, from Ningbo, and lived at No. 254 Hefeng Lane, Lujiazui. Her biological mother died when she was young. I was raised in my grandmother's house. When I came to Shanghai at the age of eight, my father had remarried. My stepmother was extremely fierce and regarded me as an adopted daughter-in-law. She beat and scolded me all day long. My father trusted his stepmother and was as fierce as her. I have endured this abuse for eight years. Today, my father pushed my head against the wall and hit me hard. I really couldn't bear the pain, so I would rather die. After inspecting her face for nail injuries, the police persuaded her to go home. The girl refused to return home upon hearing this and said that if she was forced to return, she would seek death. The police chief then ordered Detective Huang Songsheng to temporarily send her to the Jiliang Institute for care. Yesterday</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>In the morning, Detective Cheng Yongnian was ordered to find the girl's father, Zhang Xian, and summon him to the police station. Zhang confessed that he was a carpenter in the Rihua Yarn Factory and had a total of eight children. Afu was the fourth child. His wife was actually his original wife and not a stepmother. Afu was also his biological child, so where did the stepmother come from? The police chief then told him that your daughter could not bear the abuse and refused to return home. Do you have any objections? Zhang still claimed that he wanted to take her back. The police chief said that the point of contention between the father and daughter was whether Zhang's wife was Afu's biological mother and whether there was any abuse. Since the two people's confessions were different, it was difficult to understand. He will be sent to the Local Court for interrogation today.</p>
<h3>Village Woman Avoids Seeing Husband</h3>
<p>Wandering with a man in the Great World. Twisted by her sister-in-law and sent to the court for interrogation. Zhang Kangfu, a man from Zhuji, whose wife Zhang Xu was 26 years old and still pretty. Zhang was a farmer for a living. The woman could not bear the hard work, so on March 19 of this year, she obtained her husband's consent and was brought to Shanghai Jiulongdi Gaodun Road Renmei Lane No. 1 by her sister-in-law Zhang Gu to work as a domestic helper in the Xue family. The couple had an agreement that the monthly salary must be sent home for use, so that she could enjoy a more comfortable life outside than farming. However, the woman had been in Shanghai for five months without sending any money home. Her husband was furious that his wife was living a comfortable life in Shanghai but was using the salary for her own purposes. The husband was doing housework at home but received no remuneration, which was unfair. So, he came to Shanghai angrily the other day, refusing to allow his wife to stay in Shanghai and wanting to return to the countryside together and live a life of hard work. Because the woman had reversed her rural simple behavior since coming to Shanghai, she was unwilling to return to her hometown and avoided seeing her husband. Zhang was anxious and negotiated with his sister-in-law Daqi. Zhang Gu found Zhang Xu wandering with a man in the Great World the night before last, so she stepped forward and twisted him. The man avoided her and left. The patrolman at the scene then took the woman into the police station and transferred her to the Second District First Branch, where her husband was summoned and the case was sent to the Local Court for interrogation yesterday.</p>

He was hiding in Shou'an Lane under their jurisdiction, and they requested assistance in apprehending him. The head of the police approved the request and immediately ordered a Bao Detective to cooperate and go to the address. Dai was arrested and taken to the police station, then transferred to the French Concession Court for interrogation.

<h3>Fines for Setting Up Illegal Gambling Dens</h3>
<p>Bao Detectives of the French Concession Police discovered that Du Guifang and Li Zhangshi, two residents, had privately set up gambling dens and were enticing people to gamble. They immediately went to search and seized gambling paraphernalia and silver yuan. They were taken to the police station and yesterday were sent to the French Concession Court for prosecution. Police Chief Su Ming presented the facts of the case. The two defendants confessed to setting up the gambling dens. The Chinese and French judges ordered each to pay a fine of 100 yuan, to be confiscated as a warning.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den's Premises Allowed to be Unsealed</h3>
<p>A large Western-style house at No. 230 Kang Nao Tuo Road in the West of Shanghai was originally the property of a certain Westerner. It was subleased to a Chinese man named Yan, who used the premises to open a roulette gambling den due to the construction of roads beyond the concession. Day and night gambling took place, and the number of carriages and horses in front of the house was always full, with huge amounts of money changing hands. In March of this year, the Director of the Public Security Bureau learned the details and ordered inspectors to secretly go to the location with the Security Brigade late at night. They broke in on the spot, seized various gambling tools and equipment, and detained the responsible personnel. The house was sealed for further investigation. It is now learned that half a year has passed since the house was sealed. After repeated requests from the Western owner of the house for permission, the Public Security Bureau sent police to unseal the house a few days ago and handed over the Western-style house to the Westerner for recovery and management.</p>
<h3>Further Persons Involved in Murder Case in Pudong Apprehended</h3>
<p>Father Dreams of Death, Son Reveals Murderer. The District Chief Believes Dreams are not Credible. Wang Zicheng, 19 years old, of Shanyang County, residing at No. 19 Tongxing Street, Yangjiazhai, Pudong, was suddenly axed to death on the main road of nearby Tushan Road on the evening of the 15th of this month. The circumstances were reported in two previous articles. Subsequently, the Third District ordered the police to arrest Wang Qin, a suspected accomplice, in the Taoyuanzhai. According to the statement of the deceased's mother, Ji, her deceased son had hired Liang to teach martial arts with Xu Guihua and others, each paying six yuan per month. After a month, Xu only paid two yuan, owing four yuan. When the son went to collect the money, he slapped Xu twice. Xu formed a grudge and conspired with Li Xianglin and the Li Gengen brothers to take revenge. The District Chief, based on the statement, sent police to pursue the main culprit Xu and the two accomplices Li, but they had already fled. Xu's father, Liangchun, and Li's father, Zhongren, were taken to the District Office and transferred to the court for interrogation. However, Ji filed another complaint yesterday, alleging that there was another murderer, Wu Shihua, who lived in Yangjiazhai. The District Chief ordered the police to arrest Wu at his address. According to the plaintiff's statement, she dreamed last night that her deceased son told her that Wu was indeed the murderer in this case. The District Chief told her that dreams were not credible. The defendant Wu, nicknamed Xiao Erzi, 20 years old, from Yancheng, working at the British-American Tobacco Factory, stated that he knew nothing about the murder of Wang. The District Chief ordered him to be detained for further investigation and verification.</p>
<h3>Verdict Pending in Salt Smuggling Shootout Case</h3>
<p>Li Lunmao, Li Lunhua, and others involved in the smuggling of illicit salt attempted to rob Wang Guihua's salt boat and engaged in a shootout at Yuji Mound in West Shanghai. Detectives from the Public Security Bureau surrounded and arrested them, injuring Li Lunmao. The suspects fled into the water but were captured by the police. Li Lunmao, Li Lunhua, Li Changsheng, Su Dongming, Sun Xuelun, and Chen Lao Hu Zi were sent to the Local Court, where they were prosecuted for robbery and assault. Judge Zhao opened the trial yesterday. Wang Guihua stated that he had two salt boats sailing at Yuji Mound when Li Lunmao and others used guns to drive the sailors ashore and steal the cargo. He went to Malu Town to pursue them, and the Public Security Bureau sent a team to confront them. They fled into the water to escape and were arrested. Li Lunmao and others claimed that they were partners with Wang in the illicit salt business, but his accounts were unclear, so they instructed their sailors to find Wang. Unexpectedly, Wang brought more than a dozen people with guns to kill them, but they had no guns. Prosecutor Zhao argued that the defendants' statements during the investigation were inconsistent and constituted evidence of robbery. The judge ordered the debate to be concluded and awaited the verdict. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Pirates Rob Cured Pork</h3>
<p>Zheng Changshun Encountered Robbery in the Waters of Jishan. Two Sailors Chopped with Knives, One Died. Zheng Changshun, a Shandong junk ship owner, recently sailed from Nvgu, Shandong, loaded with cured pork and northern goods, to Shanghai. On the 21st of this month, when sailing to the waters of Jishan, he encountered heavy fog at 6:00 AM and anchored there to avoid danger. While anchored, two pirate ships suddenly approached from the coast and rushed towards the junk ship. Dozens of pirates armed with guns swarmed onto the ship and searched the shipowner's cabin. They broke open the boxes and only found more than 100 yuan, which angered the pirates. They tore up several account books and searched all the crew members, taking all their silver yuan. Two sailors argued with the pirates during the search and were severely injured by the pirates with knives. The pirates also opened the cargo hold and forced the crew to move hundreds of cured pigs from the ship to the two pirate ships. Fortunately, the sound of a ship's whistle approached, and the pirates stopped the robbery and fled in the two pirate ships. After being robbed, Zheng's ship reported the incident to the local naval and land authorities for arrest. The Qin ship arrived at Liuhe and docked, and the injured crew members were sent to the hospital. One crew member died the other day due to severe injuries. Yesterday, the shipowner took a train from Wusong to Shanghai to report to various cargo companies.</p>

<h3>Kaiming's New Records Arrive in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Domestically Produced Wool Floss Sells Well</h3>
<p>Recently, large companies such as Wing On in this city have launched a new cold-weather product called wool floss, produced by China's Fuyuan Factory. It is as light as fluff, as white as snow, and exceptionally warm. Only one pound of this floss is needed to make a long robe, costing only four yuan. Its heat retention is far superior to that of wool and silk floss. Wool is inherently an excellent material for keeping out the cold. This floss removes the skin and boards, extracts the pure floss, disinfects it, and fluffs it up, making its effect even greater. It is convenient to make into bedding, easy to carry, does not take up space for storage, and is inexpensive. It is very suitable for social needs. Since the major companies have displayed this floss, it has only been a few days, but customers have flocked to it, and there is a large trend of supply falling short of demand. At this time of cold winter, ladies from all walks of life who want to add new clothes should try this domestically produced wool floss. The factory's general office is located at No. 30 Mendelan Road.</p>
<h3>Gao Lu District Security Team Members Track Down Fleeing Robbers</h3>
<p>At around 2 p.m. the other day (the 25th), three people with suspicious appearances were seen running frantically in the Gaomiao area of Pudong. Detectives from the Jiangsu River Police saw them and gave chase. They were chased to Qian Langzhong Bridge. Members of the Gao Lu Second District Security Team, hearing the alarm, immediately took up arms and surrounded them. The robbers opened fire to resist arrest. Gunshots rang out for a while. Seeing that more and more pursuers were gathering, the robbers pulled up the wooden bridge in the middle of the road. The Security Team members waded across the river and continued to bravely chase them. After chasing them for seven or eight miles to Dieqiao in Gaoqiao District, the robbers finally fell to the ground after being shot. By this time, it was already dusk. Security Team members Yang Fulin and Xiao Shunsheng bravely stepped forward to capture them, seized two pistols, and escorted them to the Gao Xing District Security Team Headquarters. The team leader, Pan Hongding, interrogated them and transferred them to the Fifth Branch of the Donggou Third District for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Broadening Qualifications for Basic Members of the Domestic Goods Production and Sales Cooperative</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau initiated the Domestic Goods Production and Sales Basic Cooperative. The original requirements for Class A members were limited to women who had received higher elementary education. At a meeting the other day, it was agreed that limiting the scope to women was too narrow, and that higher elementary education was too strict because education in China was not yet universal. Therefore, it has been decided to change it to a basic family group (referred to as Class A members). Any citizen of the Republic of China who has received elementary education and is committed to using domestic products is eligible.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Executive Committee of the Li Jiao Association</h3>

<h3>A Word of Advice</h3>
<p>— Jiang Huishan</p>
<p>There is a popular habit of criticizing people in society, saying with an indifferent tone that someone is incompetent or that someone's words are absurd. Once it comes to doing it yourself, it seems that you also enter the path of [incompetence] and [absurdity].</p>
<p>The love between the sexes feels very sweet when it is immature. Once it matures, it becomes a little unspeakable pain.</p>
<p>A person can be called honest if he is not greedy, and the way to foster honesty is none other than thrift. People today who are greedy and cannot be honest are all because they have failed to be thrifty.</p>
<p>I should not use the shortcomings and secrets of others as material for conversation in tea shops and taverns.</p>
<p>Nothing is more annoying than boasting to others about one's own strengths.</p>
<p>A person is poor in his heart and should not show it in his face. Morality should not be exhausted, behavior should not be exhausted, and character should not be exhausted.</p>
<p>People without true learning are most fond of doing things with a fluke mentality, and the result will never be a happy harvest.</p>
<p>The more you read, the higher your thoughts become. To put it another way, reading is a good way to eliminate ignorance.</p>
<p>Whenever you encounter extremely difficult things, if you do it with a spirit of not fearing difficulty and seeking self-help, you can always get considerable efficiency.</p>
<h3>Record of Tan Chaling's Famous Sayings</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The passing of Mr. Tan Zu'an of Chaling has been mourned by people across the country.  The owner of the Shihu Tianhua Studio, knowing of my skill in writing about anecdotes of famous people, described to me matters concerning Zu'an.  Zu'an, when not occupied with government affairs, often perused contemporary writings and would comment on them with a certain colleague.  He said that while it is permissible to write straightforwardly about strange tales, lost events, and leisurely excursions, thus moving the eyes of those who know, it is not permissible to move their hearts; it is permissible to move the hearts of those who know temporarily, but it is not permissible to move the lasting admiration of those who know.  For the most supreme writings in the world must contain a kind of profound truth, either expressed through feelings of grievance or indignation at the times, or written during moments of leisurely excursions and travels.  A seemingly trivial matter can be used to explain a great principle, causing readers to experience an indescribable feeling, repeatedly savoring the endless flavor, which then allows it to become renowned and passed down to posterity.  Recent works by writers often leave nothing to the imagination at first glance. The reason for this lies in the fact that writers have not extensively read books on human nature and principles, which is a common failing.  This is indeed a major critique for us who wield the pen. The studio owner also said that Zu'an, in his youth, enjoyed playing pranks with his school friends.  Once, while taking an exam and staying at an inn, even though it was the middle of autumn, the scorching sun still had lingering power.  A school friend, tired from reading, lay on the couch with his upper body exposed. Zu'an dipped his brush and drew a spider on his friend's elbow.  After finishing, he deliberately exclaimed in alarm, calling out to his friend, "There is a large spider on your arm!"  The school friend, still drowsy, indeed saw a huge spider crawling on his left arm and quickly swatted it away with his right hand.  He swatted it repeatedly, and the spider seemed strange. He rubbed his eyes and then realized it was a drawing. He repeatedly called Zu'an cunning.  It is said that this school friend is still in a high-ranking position in a certain agency in the capital. When he and Zu'an chat casually and mention this old incident, they always clap their hands and laugh together.</p>
<h3>A Record of Watching the Sunrise from the Chuyang Platform</h3>
<p>— Tingbingsheng</p>
<p>Leaving the Zhaoxian Temple, the remnant stars were in the sky, and the crescent moon peeked at people. The lights along the lake were dimly yellow, as if sound asleep. I occasionally heard the rustling sound of straw sandals walking on the grass. The sound was faint and sorrowful, but the noise made the silence of the night scene seem even more profound. Turning from the lakeside road onto the mountain path, it was so dark that one could not distinguish anything. I used a flashlight to guide me, climbing the steps. The steps were covered with messy rocks, and the weeds stood tall. My sleeves were wet with dew, and I felt refreshed on my wrist. However, there was only one flashlight; the person in front holding it could not help those behind, and the person behind holding it could not guide those in front. Faced with this dilemma, the person in front held the torch, and the person behind held onto the sleeve, calling out "one, two" to synchronize their steps. Turning left and right, we followed the directions, like a large army marching through the mountains, only hearing the sound of commands. After walking several hundred steps, the light suddenly went out, and the night became as dark as death. The battery had run out. Thus, we lost our way and wandered for a long time. The sound of dogs barking in the woods was almost like the howling of mountain goblins at night. Not knowing what to do, our spirits sank. Fortunately, the sky gradually brightened, and we crawled to Yangzhuang, but a fork in the road appeared, and we could not climb further. We knocked on the door, but there was no response. So, we rested beneath it. After a while, a light flickered in the village, and we faintly heard coughing, as if an old woman had gotten up at night to investigate the movements of petty thieves outside.  We inquired about the path to the Chuyang Platform, telling her everything, but the door remained locked. We stepped back down the mountain under the dawning moonlight, found the main road, and our spirits were immediately lifted. Looking from afar, the Chuyang Platform was to the left of the Baochu Pagoda, as small as a miniature landscape in a pot. The objects on it all leaned forward as if welcoming people. There were no steep cliffs obstructing our shoulders, nor strange rocks pricking our calves. Walking among them, a clear breeze filled our chests, and we skipped and jumped joyfully, finally reaching the summit. Looking down at the West Lake, it was covered in silvery grains. The Su Causeway lay like a beauty, lingering between silver screens and pearl curtains, her sweet dreams about to end, and we faintly smelled her fragrant breath. What a magnificent scene! The remnant lamp under the flag formed a long snake shape, each grain like amber or a wax pill, like a belt binding ten thousand mountains, or the hairnet of Xizi. Just as it was about to go out, red clouds rose from the southeast corner. The scorched black clouds slightly changed in the middle, with golden threads crisscrossing, shooting up and down, reflecting a hazy, ethereal sight, like a flying dragon in a book, or burning iron in a fire. The sky was misty, also faintly tinged with carmine water. In an instant, the red clouds thickened, and golden light mingled with colorful threads, winding around left and right, like golden hairpins, rockets, lotus flowers emerging from the water, or red fish splashing their tails. It is difficult to fully describe its appearance. The time was after the fourth watch on the first day of the tenth month. The sea sun had just risen, revealing a trace, curved like a bow, bright and radiant, with no color on earth that could be borrowed to describe it. The ancients said it was as large as a cartwheel, and one could only see it if living near a waterside pavilion. But on the Chuyang Platform, we only saw a trace, which is strange. Half of the sun emerged, its golden-red color exceptionally beautiful, forming a magnificent spectacle. In an instant, it fully revealed its face, its divine light galloping, ten thousand mountains dancing, the red clouds completely receding, mirages rising, impossible to look at directly. The sun rose higher and higher, its light becoming more and more restrained. Looking remotely, the flag was still in the midst of dark clouds and a faint moon, while the water of the West Lake, dark purple in the distance and silvery waves pouring out near, was as bright as a jade mirror. The mountains around the lake were all newly made up in the mirror, waiting to meet with tourists in the morning. The three bends of the Qiantang River, to the west, reflected its brilliant light. Suddenly, we heard the cold sound of a bell ringing seven times, perhaps from the Zhaoxian Temple. Was it not? October 9th Record.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Cinema After the Autumn Cool</h3>
<p>— Chengyan</p>
<p>After the autumn cool, the cinemas in Wuhu sprang up like bamboo shoots after rain, suddenly becoming active. The old Mingxing Cinema, the resurrected Wuhu Youth Association, and the newly opened Guanghan Palace all competed to attract audiences with excellent films. However, due to historical reasons and the connections of those who selected films in Shanghai, the latter three were ultimately no match for the former two. Here is a brief record of the recent conditions of each cinema, so that one may know that Wuhu offers many places for entertainment in the autumn.</p>
<p>Mingxing: It has been open for more than two months since its major renovation. Manager Wang Yaohou entrusted Vice Manager Yu Dingxun with full authority to select films. Mr. Yu further invited Zhou Jianyun and Xu Xinfu as film selectors in Shanghai. With the power of Zhou and Xu, films from the famous companies such as [Mingxing], [Shanghai], and [Dazhonghua Baihe] were all brought in. Recently, films such as [Red Lotus Temple] and [Sister, I Love You] were always full. It is said that there are plans to screen sound films (the first film scheduled is Mingxing's [Singing Girl Red Peony]). Therefore, the magic of Wuhu's cinemas seems to be the strongest with [Mingxing].</p>
<p>Wuhu: The film selector stationed in Shanghai screens both Chinese and Western films by Yangzi River Company. Western films focus on slapstick and are accompanied by Chinese explanations, otherwise no one would watch them. A film like [Deep Palace Beauty], which premiered in Shanghai a year ago, can still sell seven or eight tenths of the seats at this time. For Chinese films, because the major film companies in Shanghai have been preempted by Mingxing, they have to settle for second best.</p>
<p>Youth Association: It is not entirely for profit (due to membership entertainment). Therefore, it is simple and crude, with only one projector and a white wall as a screen, specializing in films produced by Tianyi Film Company. Due to the cheap price, it also has some appeal.</p>
<p>Guanghan Palace: It is the most recently opened, but the building is very rough. The projectors are the same as [Mingxing], also two, but the light seems weaker. The films are all domestic, but because [Mingxing] and [Wuhu] are in front, they have to settle for second best.</p>
<p>Guomin: It uses a screen instead of white cloth and has a Paramount sound system, which are its special features. It has been closed for a long time, but there is news that it will open soon, but screening domestic films will naturally only be able to seek even lower quality. Therefore, there is a rumor that it will specialize in Western films. Its success is still uncertain. However, with [Wuhu] intermittently screening Western films, domestic and Western films will be influenced by the two powerful enemies of [Mingxing] and [Guomin].</p>
<h3>Record of Cheng Yanqiu's Precious Lotus Lantern</h3>
<p>— Wang Ruoqi</p>
<p>Yu Shuangshao and Lou came to Shanghai to perform and have been here for more than ten days. Due to worldly affairs, I have not had time to listen, which is a pity. On Sunday, my friend Lu Junsongsheng came to my residence to discuss string music and invited me to watch a play by Yu Shuang. When a song was about to end, I realized it was getting late, so I quickly drove there. Jiang Miaoxiang's Yellow Crane Tower was about to end. After a short selection, Yu Shuang and Shao Lou's Precious Lotus Lantern began. The play starts with a school scene. Shao Lou's debut with Daoban won a full house of applause. The Yaoban below has a taste in every sentence. In the past, Lisan's eyes were extremely stable in size. The Cheng character accent in the last sentence seems to be the same as Yan Laowu's record, but it is actually different. It has been changed. His Nianbai is wonderful in expression. Yan Qiu's Wang Guiying is even more beautiful than what I saw two years ago, and her voice is still as good as before. Daoban has three sentences, and the Manban has small tunes in every sentence, exquisite and transparent, listening to it with fascination. When torturing Chen Xiang, Qiu'er's portrayal of the two kinds of expressions of treating the stepmother as the biological child and one's own child is vivid. I happened to look back and saw that there were actually people in the pond shedding tears. Her artistic appeal is so deep. After listening to it, the lingering sound is still in my ears.</p>
<p>Correction: In the twenty-fourth issue of this publication, in my work [Anecdotes of the Northeast Joint Games], the fifth paragraph contains the sentence [Wu Meixian's 50-meter high jump and long jump]. After investigation, the word long jump is a mistake for [100 meters]. I hereby correct it. Zhao Lanhuanqi.</p>
<h3>Travelogue of Southeast Asia (64)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Here, many Chinese are engaged in the jade business, but the business is dangerous. I saw that the jade pebbles were just yellow-gray rotten stones, but one piece could be worth tens, hundreds, or thousands of yuan. It is difficult to determine the value. Emerald jade is considered the best when it is green. If the pebble is cut open and it is good, one can make a great fortune. If it is not good, it is worthless. The treasure of thousands is once again worth the same as dirt. Therefore, it is most difficult to recognize the treasure. This is why Bian He cried over the jade of Jing Mountain. It is sufficient to prove Zhongshan's principle that knowing is difficult, but acting is easy. If you go to the jade mine, you must take a train through Menggong. It is said that the area is prone to disease and has miasma. Tens of thousands of workers come from the ninth lunar month to the third month. People from all provinces of China are here. After April, the rainy season floods the area, and the workers disperse. Not many remain. Those engaged in this business are given food and pocket money by the capitalists every month, and they can cooperate. However, after obtaining the treasure, the workers get four parts, and the capitalists get six parts. According to this calculation, it already meets the principle of communism. I also investigated the distribution method of workers and owners in barber shops in Nanjing and Shanghai. It is also extremely fair. The owner opens the shop, provides all the equipment, and provides food for the workers. For every haircut, the owner gets six parts, and the worker gets four parts. This can also be said to be a very fair distribution of benefits. However, under the British government system here, those who obtain jade must first pay one-third to the government. The British government earns more than 300,000 and at least 180,000 to 90,000 from the jade site each year. People must first pay a share to the government and then calculate the value before distributing it. It is said that several families are guaranteed to get rich every year. As for the method of selling, the ore blocks are first taken. Because Chinese workers are skilled, the Burmese here cannot do it, so they must be transported to Shanghai to be cut and made into various jewelry and other items before being resold to Westerners. Recently, many Japanese are also selling them. Moreover, Westerners are also engaged in this business, but they cannot match the Chinese in recognizing the treasure. The Burmese have no such intelligence. However, I advocate that the economic center is now in Europe and the United States, and we should sell directly to the European and American markets in order to obtain greater profits.</p>
<p>On August 1st, at 12 o'clock, the Burmese Chinese in Jinghua held a general welcome meeting of about 300 people. Chairman Wu Yulang, I gave a speech titled "The Final Success of the Chinese Revolution and the Beginning of the World Revolution." The meeting was held at the Chinese Association and set up in the Yunnan Association. Because there are many Tengchong people here, the association is grand and magnificent. It is a Confucius Temple, and the Guangyu School's male students are very energetic. Tengchong people are so easy to come because it takes only ten days to go north from Wacheng to Tengchong. Therefore, there are many Tengchong people (that is, Tengyue). There is a New Tengchong Society organized by young people from Beijing and Shanghai, which publishes a magazine that is worth reading. I have gained a lot from coming here, and I know that the colonial cause and cultural future of the southwest will be greatly developed. In addition to the Min people's development in Southeast Asia and the Yue people's development in the Americas, the Tengchong people will develop in southwestern Myanmar and establish a new civilization in conjunction with the Buddhist transformation of India and Myanmar.</p>
<p>There is a kind of gap here, that is, the elderly mostly believe in Buddhism and love Taoism, while the young people oppose it, and even almost had a major conflict because of the July Ullambana Festival. I told them that the Buddhist Datong Socialist and the Trotskyist Keshi Lishi Gongdu have a meeting point, and the old and the young, the new and the old, were all very happy. Chen Xuemei, the owner of Ronghua Photo Studio, his wife, the Japanese Mei Chun Guanyu, and Wang Mingyang, a merchant, were all very happy with what I said. The Burmese gentleman Ge Ba also praised it very much.</p>

<p>In addition to visiting the various libraries in Tokyo, the reporter also took the opportunity to visit the University of Tokyo Library while visiting the Faculty of Law at the University of Tokyo. The library is the newest building, completed in November of Showa 3. Construction began in January of Taisho 15 and lasted for four years. The construction area is 71,435 square meters. In addition to the various rooms that a normal library should have, and being grand in scale, it also has a special research room. The book storage has 28 buildings with two and six floors, excluding the basement, covering an area of 3,119 square meters. Valuable books are also stored in a special safe and secure vault. The entire structure is made of cement, mortar, iron frame, and reinforced steel, making it extremely strong and resistant to fire and earthquakes. The design, supervision, and construction were the responsibility of Obayashi Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation, and Tokyo Construction Corporation, as well as Mitsui Bussan Corporation and other experts, with the assistance of more than 80 designers. The allocation of the six floors of the museum is as follows: the student reading room is on the first floor, the special reading room is on the second floor, the research conference room is on the third floor, the joint research room is on the fourth floor, the English complete legal code is stored on the fourth floor, the American complete legal code is stored on the fifth floor, and the works of famous European, American, and East Asian figures are stored on the sixth floor. The library has the richest collection of books among all school libraries in the country. According to Mr. Suzuki Shigeji, a research room staff member at the library, more than 40,000 volumes have been added since the Great Earthquake.</p>

<p>The market rose in waves to fifteen taels. Last week's standard gold continued to show a sharp trend, but it rose and fell unpredictably. This was because the overseas silver market had a slight reversal. At the beginning of the week, the price of gold hovered around 570 taels, with daily differences of four or five taels. Later, the silver market and drafts shrank, and large short positions rushed to cover. In the same industry, companies such as Yufeng, Yongfu, Changheng, Taikang, and Run vigorously tied up English and Japanese exchanges, so they套回条子 even absorbed cash from banks, and people's minds were excited, suddenly rushing out of the eighty tael mark, and the trend was agile, so the short side was greatly hit. However, on Tuesday, it once lay dormant and weak, only 67.7 taels, which was almost because the big bars shrank slightly, especially as the United States tended to buy silver bars, so the industry had to sell off.

However, although the exchange rates of English, American, Japanese, and other exchanges in the bank's internal market were tight, they were not as sharp as the gold market. The spot red bars were计递加 at a price of 17 taels. Now, the total number of shares in the exchange is about 40,000.

<h3>Securities Last Week, Seven-Year Soared More Than Four Yuan</h3>
<p>Last week, the spot trading in the bond market was sparse, with only 28,000 yuan traded.

Although the futures market sales were slightly better than before, they were generally still dispersed, with daily trading mostly around seven to eight million. In total, 47,945,000 yuan was traded, an increase of approximately 7.7 million yuan compared to the previous week. The Disbandment Bonds market was the most active, with the October issue at 5,945,000 yuan and the November issue at 8,130,000 yuan. The 1929 Customs and Disbandment &amp; Rehabilitation bonds were also quite good, with the October issue of the 1929 Customs Duties being only 1,600,050 yuan, while the November issue reached 10,270,000 yuan. Customs Duties were moderate, with the October issue at 2,775,000 yuan and the November issue at 2,185,000 yuan. Other bonds were quiet. The 96 Bonds market performed far worse than the previous week, with the October issue of the 1929 Rolled Tobacco at 940,000 yuan and the November issue at 860,000 yuan.

Price fluctuations were based solely on market needs, leading to chaotic trends. Among them, the daily fluctuations of the Six Rehabilitation Bonds, Customs Duties, 1929 Rolled Tobacco, and 96 Financial Bonds were extremely small. The 1929 Customs Duties fluctuated by approximately 2.67 yuan, while the Disbandment &amp; Rehabilitation bonds fluctuated by only about 1.8 yuan. Only the Seven-Year Bonds saw a significant increase of 4.4 yuan due to the severe shortage of spot goods on the market and the excellent creditworthiness of the bonds, resulting in demand exceeding supply. Other bonds were far from matching this. The situations for the 1929 Rolled Tobacco and Customs Duties Rehabilitation bonds were also good, and prices were relatively firm. The 1929 Customs Duties and Disbandment &amp; Rehabilitation bonds were sold more actively in the market, but prices were weak. The price fluctuations were still small.

<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton: Observations on Yarn &amp; Cotton Over the Past Week</h3>
<p>Creating a Relative Situation: Pessimistic View of the Cotton Market. The yarn market has been extremely pessimistic this past week. This is because the sales channels for various groups have been sluggish, leading to a gradual increase in inventory. With ample deliveries this month, cracks in the market have suddenly appeared, and the situation seems quite weak. Some manufacturers who had bought in to go long, seeing the unfavorable overall situation, have changed their minds and sold to close out their positions, further loosening market sentiment. Although foreign cotton has shown a slight rebound, the yarn market is still weak, mainly due to the lack of demand for yarn, which has caused unrest in the market. This week, current-month cotton yarn has fallen by 0.37 yuan compared to last week, with far-month falling by 1.2 yuan. Spot and Japanese yarn have fallen by 1-2 yuan, respectively.</p>
<p>The Hankou (Native) Cotton Market Shows Beautiful Potential: Spot sales of cotton remain sluggish. Various Chinese and foreign factories are already saturated with American and Egyptian cotton. Due to the high price of native cotton, there is naturally no need to purchase it, resulting in quiet trading. However, the Ningbo group has purchased a significant amount due to the 0.05 yuan lower standard of "Huoji" cotton, causing the market to turn firmer. After the market situation hardened, with the trend of American cotton turning upward, there was a relative shortage of sellers in the market, further strengthening market sentiment. Therefore, spot cotton has risen by 0.07-0.08-0.09 yuan compared to last week. However, due to ample deliveries this month, it has fallen by 0.03-0.04 yuan. However, the factories still have no way to handle the current spot cotton in large quantities. The bullish psychology for the far-month needs to look at 32 taels. American cotton is up 0.07-0.08 pounds compared to last week.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Price Increase Not Weakening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was lively and firm due to good news from Liverpool, with manufacturers increasing their purchases and more buyers entering the market. Futures prices rose by 9-11 pound tones, and spot prices rose by 15 pound tones. English cotton futures rose by 7 points, and spot prices rose by 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points. Indian cotton's market situation was firm and stable due to purchases from exporters and brokers. Pergal rose by 4 rupees, and Omar and White Rose rose by 3 rupees. The Original Telegraph Record (25th telegram). American cotton compared to the previous day, Combined Shen Standard. English cotton compared to the previous day, Combined Shen Standard.</p>

<h3>Grains: The Decline in the Rice Market Sharpens Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 30 boats arrived at Luli in Zhabei. Sales in the market were sluggish. High-quality new japonica rice fell again by 0.03-0.04 yuan, opening at only 14 yuan. Only top-grade rice could be cleared through customs for 0.01-0.02 yuan. All medium and lower grades of japonica rice saw a sharp drop of 0.06 yuan, opening at a low of 12 yuan. The decline was unstoppable. The arrival of thin rice surged, but sales were extremely slow. Top-grade thin rice barely opened at 13.8 yuan and needed to be discounted by about 0.02 yuan. The Xiàn rice market also continued to weaken, with high-quality rice returning to 11.1 yuan. Dujiān rice also loosened to 11.5 yuan, both needing to be discounted by 0.02-0.03 yuan for small quantities in order for merchants to sell quickly, as they could not afford to hold the goods for long. The source of Bujiān rice was ultimately scarce, so it only fell by a small amount, about 0.01 yuan or so. The overall market opened at 11 yuan. Bujiān rice arriving yesterday was still scarce. Because merchants were aware that the Shanghai market was weakening daily, they stopped loading, so it was not easy to cut back on the prices. Only a slightly smaller price angle was given. The exchange market for miscellaneous grains suddenly became active, and the market prices turned firm and stable.</p>
<p>Yesterday in South Shanghai, goods arrived continuously by river and were sold, but not quickly. New Changshu japonica rice fell by as much as 0.5 yuan, barely opening at 14 yuan. Sales of Sutong white japonica rice in the villages and streets of the four townships were lacking. Only retail sales occurred, and transactions were therefore sparse, with prices down by 0.02-0.03 yuan. The arrival of thin rice from Nanlu Sijing, Fengjing, Qingpu, Songyin, etc., was indeed not strong. However, the general trend was difficult to resist, and prices also weakened by small amounts. If particularly high quality, it could open at 13.7-13.8 yuan. The Yangdu Xiàn rice has already shown a sharp downward turn. Fortunately, the arrivals were still scarce, so it only fell by 0.02 yuan. The highest quality opened at 11 yuan inside the customs. The price of exchange for miscellaneous grains did not fluctuate. Yin rice, intended for liquor sales, opened at 13.8-13.9 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dumped Raw Sugar White Already Seeing Price Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received telegrams from the producing areas. Because it was Sunday, there were no arrivals. The guild's price fixing for Dutch sugar, raw sugar, and white sugar remained quiet, but the issuance by the suppliers was tight, and the transaction price was still 7.75 yuan. The market was still brisk. Finely ground white sugar was 7.8 yuan, #20 medium white sugar was 6.8 yuan, and the market was also not weak. High Dutch red sugar was 6.55 yuan, and trading was still smooth. Although Japanese sugar transactions were not overly smooth, morale turned stronger, and prices rose slightly. N Mark was 7.825 yuan, Minghua YT Mark was 7.9 yuan, YP Mark was 7.65 yuan, and TK Mark was 7.7-7.7125 yuan. The trend was quite firm. Yesterday, for dumped Dutch sugar, Xiangmao Foreign Firm sold 300 tons of #24 raw white sugar for November delivery at a price of 5.825 Dutch guilders. Yuanji Company sold 1,000 tons of raw white sugar arriving on November 29th at a price of 5.9 guilders. All new regulations included tax, and the demand was quite strong. The market price for domestic Huanggang Qing from the firms was still 7.3 yuan, and Longjiang Qing was 7 yuan, but there were only a few dozen bags, so the market situation was quite flat.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: New Shipments of Rosin Arrive</h3>
<p>The long out-of-stock WW rosin arrived yesterday at Huishan Stack via the Miscellaneous Goods Association, with over 500 barrels in stock. Due to the scarcity of goods, prices are firm. The current market can still fetch 12.5-12.75 yuan or more. It is said that factories such as soap factories and match factories have opened orders for as many as 80-90 barrels.</p>
<h3>Silk &amp; Tea: Last Week's Silk Market Even More Lifeless</h3>
<p>The Shanghai foreign firm silk market was unlikely to see any progress last week. It was discovered that at the end of the previous week, European and American silk merchants, seeing that Chinese and Japanese silk factories had successively suspended operations and silk production was decreasing daily, started to purchase spot goods, and the silk market temporarily showed a prosperous trend. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of last week, heavy snow and severe weather in New York, Seattle, Chicago, and other places in the American region caused broadcloth to sell well, but no one asked about silk. Silk factory sales suddenly stagnated, and silk prices dropped. Due to the Italian-French issue, the commercial markets in Paris, Marseille, and Lyon in the French region were in recession, the stock market crashed, silk sales were stagnant, and silk prices plummeted by 2-3 francs to 7-8 francs. Yokohama Japanese silk also fell sharply. Shanghai silk factories will all suspend operations at the end of this month, and the future of the silk market is even more lifeless. Total sales for the week were over 200 bales, and exports were over 500 bales.</p>

<h3>Impressions of a Northern Journey</h3>
<p>— Su Ling</p>
<p>(17) The Singer</p>
<p>"There's a Russian singer performing during each intermission today," Old Xie told me this news.</p>
<p>He was indeed a singer, bald-headed, with a smiling face, wearing a yellow-edged jacket, a colorful silk ribbon around his waist, and a flowered waistcoat over it. He wore red lantern trousers and flowered short boots with pointed, upturned toes.</p>
<p>When he strode out from the stage entrance, shaking his right hand and holding a triangular qin (lute) in his left, he truly resembled Douglas Fairbanks in a movie, only shorter.</p>
<p>After the welcoming applause from the audience subsided, the piano accompaniment began, and the singer began to pluck the strings of his three-stringed qin.</p>
<p>This three-stringed qin may be a unique Russian instrument (?). After watching the singer play, I realized that the instrument's playing style was particularly romantic. All five fingers of his right hand simultaneously plucked the strings. At first, the singer gently vibrated the strings, then suddenly, frantically, chaotically, nervously, his entire right hand whirled on the strings like a storm, like beasts fighting, like a raging fire, like the frenzied shouts of a crowd. Suddenly, he forcefully and skillfully flicked his right hand upwards, and the chaotic sound abruptly stopped. Then, a loud voice emanated from his mouth, and he sang in Russian. Besides being able to discern the highs and lows of his tone and the quickness and slowness of the pace, I didn't understand what he was singing.</p>
<p>He also used whistling techniques in his singing, which I also didn't understand the meaning of. After one segment of the song ended, the audience's attention focused again on his skillful playing of the three-stringed qin.</p>
<p>After finishing, he gave a medieval-hero-like bow to the audience, preparing to go backstage. But the audience's continuous applause held him back. He smiled and returned to his original position.</p>
<p>"Bubliki, go open bubliki, go open!" (a transliteration of a Russian word for a type of ring-shaped pastry) such shouts came from the audience.</p>
<p>"Bubliki, go open!" So he smiled, readjusted the strings, and began to play and sing his specialty, "Bubliki, go open!"</p>
<p>I heard them say that the song "Bubliki, go open!" was very popular in Harbin. The song's origin in Harbin was probably after the Russian Revolution. The lyrics describe a poor girl shouting in the street to sell bubliki, saying, "Bubliki, go open, bubliki, go open! Come quickly and buy my bubliki, go open, or the hot bubliki, go open, will get cold, and my little tummy will get hungry!"</p>
<p>After the singer sang and played the three segments of "Bubliki, go open!" the audience still wanted to keep him, but the curtain had already fallen.</p>
<p>According to Old Xie, this singer is a very famous three-stringed qin player in Harbin, but he also plays the guitar very well. Unfortunately, I can't remember his name, which is as difficult to pronounce as the names of other Russians.</p>
<h3>Admonition</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>Young people should always remember this:</p>
<p>The solemn and grand 25th anniversary celebration of Fudan University opened at 2 p.m. on the 17th in the spacious gymnasium. The sound of firecrackers filled the air with festivity. Those present included the founder of the school, Mr. Ma Xiangbo, the president, Mr. Li Denghui, as well as various guests, reporters, and the entire faculty, staff, and students of the school, totaling more than 5,000 people. The gymnasium was almost entirely full. Mr. Ma Xiangbo delivered the opening address, and President Li reported, his words full of sincerity and joy, hoping to encourage and inspire Fudan. What excited me the most was Mr. Yu Youren's long and earnest speech, every sentence of which was like a pearl or jade, truly a motto for young people. I dare not be selfish and borrow the valuable space of "Youth Corner" to contribute it to everyone. Indeed, this admirable admonition for young people should be deeply remembered. Mr. Yu's speech was as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow students, comrades, today is the 25th anniversary of our school, and we are also awarding degrees to me and several old classmates. The entire school is filled with a very happy atmosphere, and I also feel very gratified. Fudan is six years older than the Republic of China, like an older brother to the Republic of China. Our school is the only independent school in the country. Looking back, before the Republic of China, only Fudan opposed religious education. Therefore, the history of Fudan's establishment is extremely glorious. Why is it called Fudan? Mr. Ma Xiangbo just explained it very clearly. The naming of Fudan has a very profound meaning. Immersed in the long night, "Fudan" makes the universe shine brightly. Furthermore, the ode to the radiance of the sun and moon, "Dan fu dan xi (again and again), " is something that happened 5,000 years ago in our country. Its meaning refers to the continuous rotation of the sun and moon, which is why "Dan fu dan (again and again)" comes about. The sun and moon progress from radiance to greater radiance, from "fudan (again and again)" to greater "fudan (again and again)," which is truly gratifying. Mr. Ma Xiangbo is most familiar with the history of Fudan. At that time, Zhen Dan (Aurora University) oppressed the young people, who suffered a lot. They angrily left the school and held a meeting of the alumni association, deciding to build a school. At that time, several students were elected to take charge of building the school. Two of them were very hardworking, but they have passed away and were unable to see today's grand ceremony, which is truly regrettable. I hope that the students will never forget these two deceased people. In the beginning, the school site was on Nanyang Road, and later it was moved to Wusong. At this time, as Mr. Ma said, the school didn't even have a few tables. Later, they slowly found ways to enrich it. In the first year of the Republic of China, it was moved to the Li Family Ancestral Hall in Xujiahui. Many people didn't agree, but I strongly advocated it. As a result, it finally developed day by day in the Li Family Ancestral Hall. At that time, I had other things to do and left the school. As for my feelings about degrees, many thoughts arose. I remember that when I was in my hometown, I had no opportunity to study at all. Later, I drifted to Shanghai and met Mr. Ma Xiangbo, who introduced me to Zhen Dan. At that time, wandering in a foreign land, all hope was lost, let alone bachelor's or doctoral degrees. After a few years, I went outside to work for the country, and my studies became increasingly neglected. Now, our school is developing day by day, but the old classmates' knowledge is deteriorating day by day. Based on this feeling, I hope that all of you young students will study hard. In the past ten years or so, I have been working for the country, and today I feel that my contribution to the country is only a tiny fraction, while the neglect of my studies is deteriorating day by day. You will understand this statement when you get older. Young people should identify a standard during their study years and proceed from that standard. Today, Fudan has almost successfully become a first-class private university in the country. Many private universities take Fudan as a very good example. In the future, don't forget that Fudan relies entirely on the students' tuition fees for maintenance. Therefore, the development of our school depends on all the students to create many talents and benefit the country and society. This is the responsibility of our students. Recorded by Du Shaowen.</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Yu's speech quoted above, it will undoubtedly evoke infinite feelings. First, how difficult it was for Mr. Yu to study when he was young, how lost and helpless it was to wander in a foreign land as a guest, and finally, how he was able to enter Zhen Dan with the help of Mr. Ma. Second, how enthusiastic Mr. Yu's love for his alma mater is, comparing his alma mater to the older brother of the Republic of China, which of course has a profound meaning. Third, Mr. Yu's love for the country is even more profound than his love for his alma mater. Since leaving Fudan, he has been working for the country and has never stopped resting until now, while still constantly remembering "learning." While working for the country, he feels regret for the neglect of his studies. In fact, Mr. Yu's talent and reputation are enough to devote himself to the country and society, but Mr. Yu still always wants to make an effort in learning. This spirit of loving the school, loving the country, and loving learning makes us ordinary young college students or middle school students who do nothing all day long feel ashamed. We must make an effort to study diligently and thriftily in order to repay. It is hoped that those of us who have achieved something will not just wander around and be perfunctory with our studies, squandering the money that our parents have earned from hardship and not knowing how to cherish it. As a result, our studies will still be fruitless. This is truly unforgivable even to ourselves. After hearing Mr. Yu's "piercing" words, I think we should at least turn around and make an effort in the area of learning. Fourth, Mr. Yu himself is working hard for the country, but he never forgets us younger generations. The last few words of Mr. Yu show how much he expects from us. I hope that the young people who are currently studying will not disappoint Mr. Yu's enthusiastic expectations.</p>
<p>These are just a few thoughts on Mr. Yu's speech and admonition. As for Fudan's honorary degree award this time, I also have some opinions.</p>
<p>Fudan's award of doctoral and bachelor's degrees this time certainly has a profound meaning. Just like Mr. Yu, his love for his alma mater, his efforts for the country, and his contributions to society are known and admired by everyone. Whether in terms of learning or status, it is necessary to award a doctoral degree. Others, such as Mr. Shao Lizi, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Kuomintang and a director of the school, and Mr. Qian Xinzhi, the current Director of the Finance Department of Zhejiang Province and a director of the school, were awarded bachelor's degrees. Those who were awarded degrees, such as Mr. Zhu Yingpeng, who is famous at home and abroad for his art and is currently a member of the Supervisory Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, and Mr. Ji Yingbo, who has served at the school for 20 years and is currently the secretary to the president, all have made contributions to society. Therefore, Fudan's degree award this time was seriously considered beforehand and contains great significance. It can be regarded as shining a glorious highlight among private universities, which everyone already understands.</p>
<h3>Law School Law Research Society</h3>
<p>Moot Court Practice</p>
<p>Moot court practice is closely related to and important for those who study law. Since the Law Research Society is a purely academic research group, it should not neglect this point. Therefore, the first moot court practice was held in the special moot court of the college at 7 p.m. the night before. The case details are as follows:</p>
<p>Draft case for the first practice of the Law Research Society Moot Court Team</p>
<p>Zhao Ada, due to old age and having no son, adopted Chen Xiaomei as a concubine in April of the 15th year of the Republic of China through the introduction of matchmakers Wang Sanshan and Liu A'er. At that time, a contract was established stating that she would never be abandoned, and it was signed by Wang Sanshan and others. They lived together harmoniously. In the spring of the 16th year, they gave birth to a daughter. Unexpectedly, Zhao Ada has recently suspected Chen Xiaomei of having irregular behavior and has neglected Chen and her daughter. Therefore, Chen has filed a lawsuit for abandonment according to law.</p>

<h3>Homesickness</h3>
<p>— Shaoqi</p>
<p>"[Notice: The school will be closed for one day on October 10th for National Day commemoration.]"</p>
<p>A large group of students surrounded the bulletin board, stretching their necks. Everyone's face showed a smile. Seeing the annual National Day commemoration, everyone was excited. For the commemoration day that the martyrs exchanged with their heads and blood, there is usually a one-day holiday. Originally, students like to have holidays after attending a few days of classes at school.</p>
<p>There were no classes in the afternoon. Some students were busy packing their luggage. The students in this city couldn't wait for the holiday tomorrow and went home. Hui said, "You often suffer from homesickness. You'll always go back tomorrow, right?"</p>
<p>"I can't wait until tomorrow." I was putting my shirt into my leather bag and answered her like this.</p>
<p>"Are you leaving today?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm leaving immediately. I can still catch the train. I've already written a letter to my mother."</p>
<p>Hui smiled at me slightly, "Ha, you're as impatient as a child, wanting to throw yourself into your mother's arms and act spoiled!"</p>
<p>"..." I packed my leather bag.</p>
<p>Separated from my hometown for not long, everything was still the same as before. The slightly cold breeze greeted me gently, and the falling leaves, unable to withstand the power of the wind, played a rustling melody. The light yellow sun slowly moved westward, its soft rays. Everything, everything seemed to welcome me back. My mother was already waiting at the door, watching. Ah, I really wanted to rush into her arms immediately and receive her gentle comfort.</p>
<p>The short holiday passed in a flash, and I even stayed two days longer. This was the first night back at school after the National Day holiday. The clang of the dormitory bell vibrated in the silent air. The god of darkness took charge of all the school dormitories. The principal was also too familiar with economics, and even the few dim streetlights in the corridor were extinguished. The chilling north wind flew in from the window gap, and the drizzle wet the curtains. My roommates emitted intermittent snores. The desolate night shook my weak heart. How could the strings of a traveler's heart not pluck a melody of homesickness?</p>
<p>If the wheel of time could turn back to the present of last night, how pleasant it would be! A table was piled with fat crabs, and the family sat around to eat.</p>
<p>"Let the biggest ones be for your sister to eat. She has to go to school tomorrow. You can often eat them at home." My mother's face was full of kindness as she said, looking at my younger siblings.</p>
<p>"Sister, are you really leaving tomorrow? Can you wait one more day? We have a carnival at school tomorrow. I'm still acting in a play. Don't you want to come and see it?" My younger brother then asked me, his dark and bright eyes filled with hope.</p>
<p>"I'm missing many lessons at school and can't delay any longer. I have to go tomorrow." I replied to him.</p>
<p>Everyone was silent. Only the sound of peeling crabs broke the silence. My younger brother pouted and stared at me blankly, probably dissatisfied with my answer. After dinner, I walked around under the lamplight for a while holding my younger sister and then sat down. She was particularly attached to me tonight. My younger brother took my hand and asked me if I would come back until the New Year holiday. My second sister wanted me to write to her after I got to school. My mother told Aunt Ju to prepare some food for me to take to school. My father paced back and forth, smoking a cigarette, and told me to be careful when making friends outside.</p>
<p>"Don't say too much. Your sister has to get up early tomorrow. Let her sleep earlier." My mother said to my younger siblings.</p>
<p>My younger brother, second sister, and younger sister said to my mother in unison, "We want to get up early tomorrow to send sister to Shanghai." They turned back and called to Aunt Ju, "Call us tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>Their innocent sincerity! Why don't I usually feel it?</p>
<p>In the faint morning light, I left my sweet family and returned to school to do the work of sunrise and sunset. It's too mechanical. The teacher relies on personal opinions, the students harbor jealousy, and the travelers who leave their hometowns endure it. Why do people leave their hometowns? Lovely hometown, I don't want to leave you again. Let me throw myself into my mother's arms forever. How can a cowardly person leave their parents?</p>
<p>The sound of the wind keeps blowing, and the rain is falling even harder. Deep memories have formed a net of homesickness. How can longing for home enter my dreams?</p>

They manufacture various car bodies and finely repair various cars. No matter what kind of car, once it is repaired and calibrated by them, it can be guaranteed to be durable, fast, and fuel-efficient. Because of its various advantages, all walks of life have praised it and admired it as the overlord of automobile repair in Shanghai. It is now the first anniversary, and it is heard that a one-month promotion will be launched from October 24th. During this period, automobile repairs will be free of charge to thank the public for their patronage.</p>
<p>Tianfaxiang Fur Bureau at the entrance of the Polu Stadium on Damalu declares that their bureau is known as a reformer in the fur industry. Mr. Jiang Zhigang, the manager of the bureau, believes that the current market is flooded with foreign clothing and goods, and it is urgent to promote domestic fur clothing to stop the leakage of wealth. This spring, in addition to personally going to the border, he also sent experienced fur partners to various producing areas to search for coarse and fine fur goods, which have now arrived one after another. From now on, they will continue to sell at low prices and in large quantities, and will add a new costume department with a new plan to produce various beautiful coats as a contribution to social clothing. The style is good and the colors are many, and those who see them praise them endlessly.</p>
<p>Xian Da, Wei Lun, and Sheng Da factories declare that their three factories were the first to invent camel cashmere with the three trademarks of Camel, Tiger, Dragon and Phoenix. The material is strong and durable, the color is beautiful and trendy, and they are the leaders in the camel cashmere industry. Now that the late autumn season is approaching and the weather is getting colder, camel cashmere clothing is about to be in season, so merchants from all over the country are flocking to the three factories to purchase. Recently, in order to facilitate customers to purchase high-quality camel cashmere, the three factories have launched a joint sale. Those who want to purchase goods from the three factories can contact any of the three factories, and they will be sincerely welcomed.</p>
