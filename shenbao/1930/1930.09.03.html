<p>匈牙利在此復辟謠言甚盛之時。而忽有民衆一萬五千人之大運動。據電訊所述。運動起原。由於社會民主黨抗議政府辦理失業問題之失敗。宣布總罷工。與警察衝突。遂舉行大示威。釀成流血慘劇。夫以匈牙利財政之支絀。人民經濟之不振。又當商業凋敝稅收滅少之時。其政府對於失業問題。當然無所措其手足。因政府救濟無辦法。而激起民衆憤怒。亦爲事理上所應有。况當荷綏政府專制之初。即有多數暴力團體專喜與人爲難。今其餘風。猶有存者。故今日社會民主黨。登高一呼。不期而集者。乃如如是之衆歟。抑以赫伯斯堡王室復辟之陰謀。醖釀已經數年。奥都正位之說。愈傳愈盛。故民衆借此示威。以示警戒。或竟有復辟黨徒。乘機攙入利用。以圖搗亂歟。夫今日之舉。果專爲失業問題。已足使政府無法應付。若更挾有其他政治與黨派意味。恐愈不易收拾矣。蓋匈國所處地位。甚爲困難。非僅各小協約國時時加以注意而已。自復辟之說起。各國固有表示反對者。然亦未嘗無暗助之者。假使此失業風潮未已。而復辟又從而實現。則其糾紛所至。豈易測哉。今日之風潮。能即消滅。則向</p>

<p>電通社二日東京電第五次樞府精查委員會、於昨午後一時開會、質問之烈、在預想以上、相信已與政府以相當之重創、先由與統帥權問題有直接關係的軍部出身之河合大將、開始質問、荒井金子兩氏助之、伊東委員長亦時時藉口議事進行、發言窮追政府、雖在暑中、前後論戰達三時間十分之久、致令濱口首相財部海相進退維谷、質問先由原則白議論開始、首問「兵力量之决定、是否須軍部之同意、」首相答以有得軍部同意之必要、旋河合大將入於第二段之質問、然則政府於决定回訓時、曾得軍部之同意否、首相答以大體已得同意、河合大將又提出加藤前軍令部長之反對上、奏及軍令部長之更迭問題、質問財部海相、海相乃朗讀回訓發送時、接到加藤前部長所發之電文、謂「回訓已發無法挽回、此後望關於艦種之融通及其他之點、更加一層之努力、海相即根據此電、解釋加藤前部長並非反對、而河合荒井金子三委員以及伊東委員長等、對此解釋、認爲不足、故到底不能與以諒解、河合大將更要求財部海相提出往返電文全部、如其不能、則審議進行、難望進步云、又質問濱口首相、謂財部海相與軍令部長關於統帥權</p>
<p>問題、曾交換覺書、究意此舉有何必要、首相答以此係軍部内部之事、與政府無關、河合大將更質問財部海相、謂財部海軍大臣對於協定之條約、旣以全權資格簽字、何以於歸國後、開軍事參議會議時、又承認兵力量有缺、責海相之二重人格甚力、海相幾窮於答辯、汗如雨下、雖一時敷衍過去、然當日之會、已與政府以重創、第六次精委會定明日午後一時續開、必有更深刻之論戰、</p>

<p>戴劉兩委帶往前敵發佈</p>
<p>中央執行委員會前派戴傳賢劉紀文兩委員赴前方勞軍、並發佈「慰勞全體將士書」及「慰勞戰地民衆書」各一、由戴劉兩委員帶往前敵戰地分發、茲錄原文如下、</p>
<p>慰勞全體將士書忠勇的武裝同志們、我們討伐禍國殃民興兵造反的閻錫山馮玉祥、辛苦作戰受了很大的犧牲、各位的功勞、各位的英勇不但中央忘記不了、就是全國的民衆也一致的忘記不了、中央特派戴委員傳賢劉委員紀文來前方、慰勞各位、向各位表示最充分的警意、要中國全體的人民能夠生存在世界上、便不能不有眞正的統一、不統一則對内不能修明政治、對外不能保障國權、人民的痛苦不能解除、不但我們没有生路、就是我們的全體同胞也都没有生路、閻錫山是洪憲皇帝的走狗、馮玉祥是北洋軍閥的餘孽、他們都是破壞統一的罪魁、他們都是要趕全國人民到死路上去的、所以我們非討伐這班反賊不可、非根本消滅這班反賊不可、中央對於討伐叛逆、抱最大的决心、所以特命蔣總司令親自督師、領導大隊、到最後勝利的路上去、出師以後、賴全軍將士忠勇奮發屢次大勝、使反賊膽寒、最近克復濟南、不僅是克復了一個省城、最重要的還是消滅了閻錫山全部主力的隊伍、使他完全失掉了作戰的能力、隴海綫上馮玉祥的叛軍、本來就傷亡了大半、現在兎死狐悲、個個喪膽、而且閻錫山自救不暇、更没有力量能接濟他們的子彈糧食、他們的子彈打完一個少一個、他們的糧食吃過一天少一天、所以他們作戰的能力、也一天减少一天、他們的末日、是算得到的、祗要我們鼓起勇氣、敵人就不難全部消滅、當然我們也知道我們忠勇的將士太辛苦了、但是逆軍的困苦更比我們大十倍百倍最後的勝利、就是我們一切艱難辛苦的代價我們要有最後的勝利國家才有眞正的統一、那時候國家才可以有長久的太平、眞正的建設、三民主義才能實現、中國全體的民衆、才能夠生存在世界上最後的勝利、就在各位的前面、世界的光榮、歷史的名譽、正在等著各位、那時候全國都慶祝各位的凱旋、現在先向各位致懇切的慰勞、中國國民黨中央執行委員會、</p>
<p>慰勞戰地民衆書國家不幸、於統一告成以後、又發生北洋軍閥餘孽閻錫山馮玉祥造反的事情、中央不得已才來用兵討伐、在河南山東一帶打仗的地方我們親愛的老百姓、受反賊的殘害、砲火的死傷、弄到妻離子散、家破人亡、種不了田吃不成飯、種種悽慘痛苦的情形、那一件中央不知道、那一件不是在中央引爲最可痛心的事情、人民國家的中央是人民的、中央對於我們苦痛的老百姓同情到說不出的地步、所以特派戴傳賢劉紀文兩委員前赴戰地慰問、我們親愛良善的老百姓、一定要問中國國民黨領導的國民革命不是說已經成功了、國民政府不是說已經統一中國了、爲什麽我們還要受這種痛苦你們不知道、國民革命並不曾完全成功、爲什麽呢、就是因爲閻錫山馮玉祥在作梗、在破壞、他們把國家的土地當作自己的地盤、把國家的財富、當作自己的私産、把國家的軍隊、當作擁護自己的家奴天天要錢、天天預備打仗、弄到不但國家什麽事都不能辦、就是人民自己要經營什麽事、也都不能經營、内政因爲各方面的牽掣、不能修明、捐稅因爲各方面預備打仗、不能减輕、帝國主義者因爲看見中國没有整個的力量、也就不能退步、讓我們廢除不平等條約、最傷心的是當前年統一告成的時候、中央年見北方各省、尤其是西北一帶地方人民因天災人禍、至於不能生存於是盡其全力、並且聯合海内外熱心慈善的同胞籌集鉅欵從事賑災、所籌得的賑欵、不下千餘萬、而這一種賑濟北方災民生命的金錢糧食、都被馮玉禮扣留截奪、作爲他的兵餉兵糧並且就拿這宗糧欵來做謀反的準備、不單是忍令北方人民餓死、還要把全國已得到的統一和平從新打破、不只這些、馮玉祥</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>一面截奪中央賬濟災民的糧欵、預備造反、一面又勾結蘇俄、聯絡共産黨、來危害中國、所以去年一面馮玉祥在西北稱兵、一面蘇俄就在東北入宼、而同時長江各地已經鎭壓了下去的共匪、又四處乘機竊發、他們的行動、是聯絡一致的、在這種强盜軍閥武裝刦持殘民引寇的局面之下、若是再寛大容忍下去、便是養癲遺患、中國人民眞要同歸於盡了、無論何國何代的太平、都是要掃除了這種萬惡勢力、方能得到、我們現在的情形、决不能夠獨成例外、所以中央爲民族生存長治久安之計、於閣馮兩逆興兵作亂的時候、特命蔣總司令統率大兵、親自去討伐、所以大家對於這次的打仗、應當有以下三種明白的認識第一、這次是爲三民主義來和封建勢力打仗、第二、這次是把國家武力來和私人武力打仗、第三、這次是爲國家統一來和割據軍閥打仗、說到統一、更是醫治現在一切病症的根本、不統一則軍閥永久維持私人的武力來禍國家、害人民、三民主義就永久不能實現、中央也知道打仗是不幸的事、但是爲討伐叛逆而打仗、是不得已的事、古人所謂、「毒蛇螫手、壯士斷臂」、正是這個道理、大家不要看見閻馮兩逆也躱在靑天的日旗子的底下、便誤解子這是中國國民黨内部的鬥爭、應該明白閻錫山本是洪憲皇帝的走狗、馮玉祥本是北洋軍閥的餘孽、何曾知道有中國國民黨更何曾知道有三民主義、他們不過借中國國民黨的名義、借靑天白日的旗子、來掩護他們、來淆亂民衆的目光、至於其餘一班叛黨的分子、失意的政客、爲子自已的權利、去依靠他們、眞是等於賣身投靠、没有廉恥極了軍閥一失敗、就可以看到樹倒猢猻散的醜態出現、中央這次討伐叛逆、是抱了最後的决心作最大的努力、幸出師以來、我們的將士異常奮勇屢次打過大勝仗、最近打下濟南、不僅是克復了一個省城、乃是經過大戰以後消滅了閻錫山的主力軍隊、使他們没有翻身的餘地、馮玉祥的主力軍隊、本已消滅了大半、兎死狐悲、他們是不久就要消滅的、况閻錫山自救不暇、那有力量來接濟他們槍械子彈糧食、所以濟南克復以後國際和國内的眼光立刻轉移過來、認識中央軍隊的力量逆黨的崩潰就在眼前、最後的勝利屬於中央在打仗的時候、中央軍隊狠得戰地民衆的帮助如歸德的民團、各地的游擊隊伍、和其他一切帮忙的老百姓、忠勇奮發都是我們所應當懇切慰勞的這種帮助、還望不斷的繼續下去、你們的親友之中、若是迫於環境、在逆軍裡做事的、還望切實勸導、効順來歸、中央一定不咎旣往、推誠錄用、總之、大家幫助中央軍隊早一天全勝、則軍事早一天結束、軍事早一天結束則國家早一天統一這不但是解除你們現在急切的痛苦並且帮助全國的國民解除長期的痛苦祗要軍軍事一結束統一一完成、中央必定盡全付的力量刷新政治、必定爲政治開一個新局面、不但我們戰地的民衆、就是全國的民衆、也能安居樂業、大家一致努力、爲中華民族打出一條新生路來、中國國民黨中央執行委員會</p>

<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>今日之紙烟。乃似昔之雅片。偶游街市。則見婦孺老幼。幾人手一枝矣。洪水猛獸。議者憂之。英美文明之邦。嘗有連絡三四知已。組織一戒烟同盟會。拒烟草於千里之外。視之若仇敵者。意亦善也。然而法律對於吸烟（雅片例外）。初無禁止之條文。社會上亦視吸烟若常事。無道德上之制裁。然而女子吸烟。社會輒目之爲不倫。且有大聲疾呼以打倒之者。男女平等云乎哉。亦無怪乎倫敦女子之嗜烟成癖矣。</p>
<p>女子吸烟廣告　基於男女平等之觀念。二十世紀之倫敦女子。乃無不反其舊習。嗜烟成癖。回憶數十年前。女子吸烟。英美各國輒懸爲禁例。尤以公衆之地爲尤甚。至今倫敦社會。此種禁例。早若具文。家庭之間無論已。公園之中。街道之上。甚而至於戲園車馬之間。亦常見老幼男女手持紙烟。入口狂呼。不以爲怪。然而回顧美國。則女子吸烟。尙視爲可羞之事上等婦女。尤惡之如仇。交際塲中。有女子在。男子吸烟亦須先向之道歉意。否則即視爲無禮。美國女子之不吸烟乃有若是者。年前。美國有某大報上揭載一紙烟之廣告。作一女子吸烟之狀。一時頗爲社會所不滿。敎會團體更提出正式之抗議。迫其停刋方止。</p>
<p>皇后吸烟破禁　紙烟之盛行於倫敦婦女界旣似上述矣。然考其盛行之由。則無有知之者。惟據深諳倫敦掌故者言。則有二大原因可述。其一即爲世界上紙烟産量之增加日甚。一班巧思之徒。爲推廣其營業起見。數年前發明一種細小之紙烟。專供婦女之吸用。烟味和順。裝璜美麗。少數婦女初爲好奇之故。購而吸之。久之乃成癖。今且風行一時。視爲一種慣習矣。其二則爲倫敦女子吸烟。英國皇后實爲厲階。倫敦女子雖已盛行紙烟之吸用。然於皇家之園游會中。輒不敢任意爲之。良以有皇后在。平民何敢放縱哉。不意年前。在某公爵之宴會上。皇后亦列席。主婦爲尊敬皇后起見。事前曾通知來賓。勿在席上吸烟。不意席方半。皇后忽起立。向各處覓紙烟。不得。乃命從者向主婦索取主婦乃大駭。急備上好紙烟以餉之。來賓之素有紙烟癖者。亦羣出其所携。相與吸用。一時烟霧迷漫。皆大歡喜。於是皇后吸烟之事。喧傳遠近。而倫敦婦女之吸烟。乃益覺無所顧忌矣。</p>

<p>— 劉恨我自杭州寄</p>
<p>世風澆漓。日趨險詐。冒名招搖層出無已黨國之紅人物。往往爲人竊名持書晉謁。戚屬同僚。或紹介求差。或冒昧稱貸。當者苟不經意。輒墮其術中。報載何應欽氏啓事。即可證之也。日前杭垣亦發生一冒函求差事。誠屬無獨有偶。緣有王韵號炳泉者。晉謁兩浙鹽務緝私局局長甄紹燊氏。自稱從海上謁財政部緝私處處長温應星氏。轉囑前來。並出呈財政部鹽務署署長鄒琳之八行書。據請委王以緝私大隊長位置。甄局長初不之疑。視爲常事。惟以一時無相當位置。囑其少待。王遂興辭去。數日後。甄局長忽接温處長書云。前來之王某持函求差。曾復鄒署長。刻獲還雲。謂王韵其人向不相識。亦未曾推薦。竊名干進。恐非善類。請將原函寄回查辦。一面並乞知照。勿予差。委。免生事端等語。甄局長閱竟。洞悉其情。即置之。乃昨日王復蒞止。聲稱候差多日。未蒙委任。殊無以報鄒署長命。言下頗有憤慨之色。又言倘大隊長一時無着。即中隊長亦可屈就。將來再行升調云云。甄局長遂詢其識鄒署長否。王曰。然向在廣州相識。誼屬多年老友。再詢該書來由。則答面請鄒署長親筆予之。甄局長不可耐。笑道所以。王聞言顔色立變。嚴質之。則謂本人與鄒署長並非素稔。僅識鹽務署秘書名陳澤沛。該函乃陳所轉致來者。甄局長細察語氣。前後不符。且與鹽務署秘書多屬故交。初無陳澤沛其人。於是王冒函之罪乃證實。立拘留之。一時座上客遂作階下囚矣。王年約三十許。衣西服。操皖音。容貌舉止。票亮殊甚。聞曾任兩浙緝私第十大隊第四中隊長。後以舞弊被撤。今茲舉動。竊名干進。未免本性難移也。甄局長以此種行爲。不特於鄒署長有害。對於社會信用。影響尤大。擬送法庭懲戒。以儆效尤云。</p>

<p>— 黎六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>又據泰晤士報之統計。自一九二一年來。生活約减低百分之二二·五。而同時期内失業救濟費之比率。對於獨身男子增加百分之一三。對於已婚而有三孩之男子增加百分之三○。耕地工人乃英國各階級中生活最苦而生殖力最强者。彼輩無尺土寸地。僅恃兩臂謀生並贍養一家老少。現在此類耕地工人假使爲三小孩之父親時。每星期便可領得三十二先令之失業救濟費而此工人當有工作時每星期亦不過得酬三十五先令而已。好逸惡勞。人之情也。星期多得三先令而盡日揮汗工作耶。</p>
<p>再舉一實事爲證。有一僕人與其妻共傭於一邸宅。每年得酬一百至一百二十金鎊。經過種種考慮。此僕人忽與其妻同時辭職。人或問其故。則答以再三計算之結果。男子絶不工作。僅任其妻每星期作零工二三日。兩人收入且較平時爲優云。類此之例。不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>現在英國輿論多攻擊工黨内閣今年成立之失業保障法案。謂此法案所定領取救濟費之資格太寛。救濟之數目太巨。致多數工人存僥之心。企圖避免工作。不勞而食。不惟使英國經濟有破産之險。且於國民道德之墮落有助長之嫌。據各報意見。爲澈底解决失業問題計。爲挽救英國實業計。社會保險法均有修改之必要。對於眞正失業工人雖應予以救濟。然以適足維持生活爲限。且救濟費之發給應以有工作時曾充分繳納保險基金爲條件。但此種建議。各政黨多以冷淡之態度應之。不願有所表示。何也。事關内政。一有改動。牽涉至鉅。且恐因此招致工人反感。予本黨前途以大不利也。</p>
<p>總之。英國失業問題之解决。雖有待於世界經濟之活躍。及東方市塲之回復。但與内政方面之改革亦大有關係。而改革内政非有長時間之努力與一往直前之勇氣不可。故麥克唐納内閣此時疾首痛心之二百萬工人失業問題。前殊無解决之望。</p>

<p>第十四回　翠竹淚斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離</p>
<p>可憐的翠筠的交親。旣是一個老實人。又是一個糊塗蟲。即使有什麽話說。被他的老婆喉嚨一響。三魂便嚇走了兩魂。不敢再多嘴了。而他的女兒便入了火坑的地獄。講到上海把良家小兒女。鬻入娼家。却有種種制度。有的是賣絶的。有的是押十年的。有的是押三年五年的。有的是包一節的。一言以蔽之。這都是囚徒生活。賣絶的好比是無期徒刑。十年五年三年的。這便是有期徒刑。就是包一節的。也等於做苦工四月。但是國家制定刑罰。原是爲懲罰罪人而設。試問那班天眞可愛的小姑娘。他們是犯了什麽罪。無辜受此荼毒。這豈不是社會間不平之事。翠筠那時就被秀姐押與人家十年。從十四歲起始。一直要到二三歲的年底爲止。這個有期徒刑十年。差不多等於無期徒刑了。你想一個女子的靑春。全在這十年工夫。那十年光陰。都斷送在牢獄生涯。一生也可算了結了。受押的人家。也得花一些本錢。給伊吃。給伊穿。給伊敎曲子。到了十六歲法定年齡。就不能不掛牌子。出堂唱了。幸而小孩子還乖巧。本家還慈善。少吃些苦頭。不然。朝打夜駡。枯瘦如鬼。一塲病糟塌死了的。那種小寃魂。也不知有多多少少。還有身體尙未發育完全。年齡不過十三四歲。淫龜惡鴇。不顧生死。只要想錢。威脅之下。接了那種恣圖獸慾。不顧人道的開苞客人。重的至於殞命。輕的也成了終身之病。那又是司空見慣之事。不過翠筠倒也還好。到十八歲纔破了貞操。那個客人。本來要討伊的。無奈家裏也是一隻河東獅。無可奈何。只好用金錢來彌補這個缺憾。他帮助翠筠自己贖了一個身。可見娼門生涯。完全和罪犯制度一般。金作贖刑。也是用金錢可以贖罪的。他們的那種不成文法。是加倍贖取。譬如三百塊錢買來的。要六百塊錢可以贖取。押賬也是如此。照這樣子。也要有人帮忙。或請敎護花律師。或在他們的非法裁判所。所謂茶會上老頭子斷下。纔許你贖身自由。否則他們掯住了你身體。什麽手段都可以用出來。因爲他們把你嫁出去。至少就是三千五千。無論如何。總不止區區贖身加倍的數目。翠筠那時也幸虧了這個客人。明中暗中帮助伊得到了一點自由。</p>

<p>閘北　昨日河下到船仍稀、各帮辦胃頗濃、北帮白破大盤達二十一元、限價之列、普通中關均步漲兩三角不等、查邇來粳米市情、乃受内地産市之影響、及新貨未能續旺、兼洋米轉口甚多、存積頓薄、雖有湘贛米躉批來申之傳說、然目前究無一定把握、遂成激漲之勢也、東新粳到貨仍少、碾米廠方面售意趨淡、故行情又好三角至半元、做開十八元四五角、普通十八元一二角、買氣極濃、新客秈表面上仍盤旋於十四元左右、實際上中貨又昂兩角許、此貨到頭固接、惟有客銷問津是以由平淡而趨緊俏、薄稻銷化尙可、但到稀而乏神、行情稍堅而已、白元市反欠佳、緣連日價漲太銳、致乏進胃、而貨客則不免抱速售之意、大盤因此回小一角至兩角、高貨仍在十九元許、</p>
<p>滬南　河下來船續少、本街買胃因貨微而不注意、雖略揀擇採進、然交易不免轉薄、高貨破粳益形沉寂、價因來源時有時無、故漫無準則、大都隨北市而行矣、至於中次貨亦祗微交、趨勢尙佳、盤面見提一兩角、如同里貨等悉在十七元八角之譜也、新粳來源略見、市銷甚可、價步漲半元、開十八至十七元半、新羊尖到銷兩抵、大部隨到隨空、高貨在十五元左右、較前盤約升角半之譜、白元存到兩稀、市甚寂寞、價與滬北相彷耳、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、仍見疲滯之象、交易亦清淡異常、因天津方面、自申粉禁裝後、以民食關係祗有改定洋粉、以資調劑洋行方面、因合價已能接近亦步步兜售、直接送到、所以本埠市面、以實銷之見阻、人心自然轉寂、雖操縱者尙未死心塌地、不願放鬆、但就事實言、彷彿申粉之抬住、及不能出口、即間接爲洋粉來華添一生路也、此後如廠抛加碼、或者市勢當就平疲也、結果本月份小二厘半、十月份小七厘半、十一·十二月份小五厘、正月份小七厘半二月份小一分半云、</p>

<p>由花車而至鐵甲車</p>
<p>汽車初行之時。客車視爲花車（即游車）。當時祗富豪巨商有力購置。其用意無非出於好奇。咸以駛乘汽車作爲一種新娱樂。今則不然汽車已爲現代之運輸利器。即富麗汽車。價值低廉。普通人士亦能置之。</p>
<p>貨車尤爲後進。通行以來。爲時僅三十年。以其堅固經濟。向爲運輸工俱。致於當初第一輛貨車如何製造。如何式樣。是否利用客車或他車。裝一馬達發動。今已無從考研矣。</p>
<p>據多數之推測最早貨車爲馬車匠承造。木板車身内裝置引擎駕駛齒輪及車板。實與游車大同小異也。</p>
<p>此種運輸車。能力有限。用途不廣。於是有提倡機器貨車之動機。從事建築。以應急需。運輸食糧牲畜。油煤磚石。彈藥銀錢與木器種種。尙有各業商店。需要各式底盤車身。以合其用。藉得美滿迅穩之服務。亦無不可特别裝配。</p>
<p>今以運輸食烛牲畜言之。十年前各大城市之牛奶接濟。均賴火車與小車輸送。今則所有食物。米麥蔬粉。蔬菜牲畜。莫不應用貨車運輸。今各種公司工廠。不但以貨車爲經濟迅速之運輸器。並用此以作爲全城活動廣告。今運貨汽車用途之廣與効力之大。已爲人人所共知。</p>
<p>貨車以外。今則進而爲護送車。通稱鐵甲車。鋼殼車身。完全武裝。以運金銀股票金銀珍物。今各大城之大銀行公司所用者。均特别裝置。穩妥安全。萬無一失。最新運貨汽車。即護送車。速力迅快。機身堅固。底盤低闊。重量充分。窗戶玻璃與風擋之玻璃。不受子彈。永不碎裂。前後車門緊鎖。用鐵桿横阻。非後車門啓動不開。由護士管理。以防車夫之陰謀。藉保駕駛員之安全。車頂車尾均有機關槍之設備。以防途受搶刦。足敵意外攻擊。貨車之進化。至今可謂精敏矣。</p>

<p>— （黄影呆）</p>
<p>在最近兩星期前。美國福特車廠重要職員高夫林WilliamC.Cowling氏。由美來華。在滬逗留多日。並於日前由滬出發。至滿洲里及中國北部各省。從事考察。高夫林此行。其唯一目的。即在根據中國各地情形。以作福特在華分廠擴展營業之規畫。蓋近年以來。福特對於中國之經濟情形。以及各地狀况。莫不萬分注意。想在華擴大分廠之計畫。早已藴蓄於其心中也。</p>
<p>當高夫林在滬之時。備受中西人士之歡迎。酬應頗爲忙碌。離滬北往之日。高氏又語人曰。渠之在滬。雖爲日無多。然對於上海及附近各地。已有深刻之印象。並深信今日之中國。雖處於混亂狀况之下。將來必爲遠東各國。唯一之汽車市塲。蓋日前中國各省。正在積極建設。將來汽車之銷路。大有發展。可斷言也。高氏並以福特對於經濟方面之觀察。告諸滬人。福特之言曰。「金錢與財富。不能視爲一物。而所謂財富者。乃由人民之經騐。進化。及努力而得來。至於金錢之本身。則完全無能爲力者也。其能存在也。惟財富是賴。設無財富。則金錢亦無用武之地矣。發達與財富。又不可混爲一事。蓋所謂發達者。乃流動之財富也。兩者可各自獨立。無相互之關係。蓋一國之中。政府有時握有重大財富。而人民則頗爲貧困。換言之。人民亦可擁有重大富源。而政府則異常貧困。故財富一物。有時能使人民富庶。而同時亦可使之貧乏。具有兩種相反之勢力。惟最優之力量。在能建設普通發展之堅礎耳。」蓋福特車廠。近來營業計畫。均根據此種原理。即職員薪水及普通營業政策。亦依此而進行也。</p>
<p>近來美國各地。各種實業。類皆不無停滯之現狀。於是職員之工薪。同時亦因而低减。然福特則不然。對於廠中開支。反極力增加。其目光之遠大。亦可想而見矣。蓋在福特心中。以爲欲求事業之發展。當先求社會購買貨物力景之增加。要之。福特之種種營業政策。並非具有仁慈博愛之心。乃深知社會經濟原理耳。故目前仍亟亟於推廣營業範圍也。近來福特對於道路事業。亦異常注意。良以道路之發展。能增進交通及運輸之力量。故明年在美國舉行之道路研究會。福特將親自出席。發表意見云。</p>
<p>至於高夫林氏此次在滬。心中亦頗滿意。因經過一度之考察後。對於新廠所設之地點。亦已有端倪。福特在美國各報之上。早已言及。謂將在中國方面。創設一大規模之新廠。而上海則視爲設廠最適之處。大致設廠問題。待九月間高夫林回滬之時。即可根據其考察所得從事進行矣。</p>

<p>全省路線網　建設廳鑒於宿式道路之爲略形發展。爲統等路政起見。將全省公路路線網。預爲規定。以免將來衝突重複之弊。計選定幹選十道。計二·七九五公里。支綫四十道。計三·九五三公里總計六·七四八公里。業經省政府委員會第二二四次會議議决通過將來全部完。成。則康莊大道。遍及全省矣。又擬定之公路路網。雖有六千七百餘公里。内已築成公路綫。約占十分之一强。正在進行及預擬在五年内完成者。亦不在少數。而其中一部份。且有改築鐵路之計劃。前將已成未成各公路及計劃鐵路之路線。與原定公路路網。計幹綫中之經綫有六。偉綫有三。沿海綫有一。共二·七九五里。支線有四十線。有三·九五三里。現將第二經線改築蕭山至金華鐵路。第二緯線之縉浦線。改築麗水至龍泉之鐵路。浦安支線建威線改築建德至威坪之鐵路云。</p>
<p>公路局事業　本省掌司路政機關舊爲浙江省道局。直隸於省行政最高官。署局内設工務處及總務營業財務之科。分掌各項事務。其各路工程進行時。則分叚設立區工程處。已成各叚則設立管理處。除局長副局長由省長任用外。其餘職員均由局長委任。自建設廳成立。省道局改隸於建設廳。並曾經一度之改組。局長副局長總工程師。均由省政府任命。至民國十七年四月改省道局爲浙江省工路局。其組織規程。亦略有修改。復以杭長。杭縣。杭市杭昌。蘭常。永麗等五綫。亟待施工。由省政府頒佈浙江省公路局工程處組織規程以資遵守。各區工程處設工程司。管理全區工程。區以下分爲叚。設佐理工程司。管理一叚工程。至十七年八月杭紹路之拱三段。即基本線。完工通車。而各路新工。亦均在積極進行之候。事務繁重。不得不將公路局之組織。呈予擴充。故於十七年十一月提出浙江省公路局規程。經省府通過。其與原組織不同之點。則設總工程司兼工務處長一人。機務總管兼車務處長一人。均由省政府任命。而將原有營業科裁併於車務處。至區工程處之組織。亦因公路建築。急於分途進行。復經省府修正浙江公路局區工程處組織規程。於區以下設段。段之長度自五十里至六十里。段以下設分段。分段之長途。以二十里爲限。區設主任工程司。截至民國十八年底止。陸續完成者除拱三外。尙有紹興接線·鄞奉路·杭長路·杭平等路。合計二五五·六○公里。</p>
<p>商辦各公路　浙省商辦公路事業。以杭餘公路爲早。創議於民國十一年。繼之者爲餘臨。餘武。杭富。（已收回省辦）杭海。瓶湖雙。寗長等公司。省辦浙閩線嵊新段。亦由商人組織公司。承租營業。於是嵊杉。給曹嵊。寗袁。嵊長。餘孝安。寗德等路。亦相繼進行。迄今復有常玉。杭瓶。衢康等路之組織。是故商辦各路。共有十六家公司。資本總額爲國幣四·○六○·○○○元。資本額以給曹嵊爲最大。計國幣銀一·○○○·○○○元。衢康路爲六○○·○○○元。常玉爲四○○·○○○元。杭海及餘臨兩路爲三五○·○○○元。嵊長路爲三二○·○○○元。杭餘及餘武兩路各爲二五○·○○○元。其商辦各公路之幹支線。共長九六·三一公里。已經築成者。占三四六·一○公里修築中者計八七·一二公里。計劃中者計一○一·六八公里云。</p>
<p>車輛之數量　各公路現有之車輛。以杭紹路爲最。計蕭紹路有六五輛。拱三路有二三輛。杭餘路三一輛。杭長路二九輛。杭海路二八輛。紹曹嵊路二七輛。至於客車一項。除杭紹路拱三段之車輛。因兼駛市路。其數量特高外。以杭紹路蕭紹路爲最高。計九四·五輛。杭餘路六三·六輛。紹曹嵊路五四·六輛。而以寗袁路九輛與常玉路之七·二輛爲最低。小包車以紹曹嵊路爲最高。計二四·五輛。杭紹路及杭餘路各二三·一輛。嵊長路爲一七輛。杭谿路一六·一輛。餘武一四·四輛。其以類别分者。計營業用車二九三輛。業務及公務用車三二輛。營業用業用車中。以客車居多數。計有普通客車二一一輛。小包車七一輛。合共二八二輛。可見全省公路。均致全力於客運。其收入較大者。不過常玉與瓶湖雙兩路而已。</p>
<p>各路之工程　公路之修築。要以適合現代運輸之需要爲原則。其工程設施。必須吻合寛廣平直之條件庶幾行車安全。旅客信任。營業類以發達。若路身狹窄。坡度陡峻。弧度奇銳。路面不平。則車行其上。顛陂振蕩。坐者苦之。且播蕩太甚。機件易於拆斷。車輛甚至傾覆。乘客更有性命之虞。浙省對於公路工程。由如遵鐵道部所訂要點外。亦有相當之規定。如曲線之最小半徑。以十六公尺爲標準。最高坡度定爲百分之四。遇有不得已時增至百分之八等是也。其路面之寛度最狹者爲四公尺半。最闊者爲七公尺。平</p>

<p>— 影</p>
<p>頃據者靈傳來之消息。謂五二五飛霞新車。獲得波斯汽車協會所賞金杯一隻。價值頗鉅。乃自該會成立以來。歷次所舉行之競賽會中。最珍貴之奬品也。自六月二十二日。以迄二十九日。前後共計八日。由汽車協會主持之波斯全國汽車競賽會。即開始舉行。競賽之時。節目共分八節。均屬艱難之行程。全途長三一○○基羅米達。合一九二六英里。此次競賽趣味之濃厚。得未曾有。故全歐人士。莫不注意萬分也。加入競賽之人。爲數頗多。而全球各汽車廠。所有出品。殆亦莫不參加矣。而競賽之規則。尤屬苛嚴。不特注意行車之速率。以及機件之耐久力量。且有二基羅米達之比速。及三基羅米達之爬山比賽。他如制動及加速。亦分段比賽。所有車輛。對於各種競賽節目。均須表演完竣。否則不能得標。可知得獲錦標之希望。亦難乎其難矣。當賽車之時。並有嚴秘之停車規則。加以限制。且車行之時。減熱器内。中途不准加水。在此種情形之下。萊寗斐爾德Rahnenfeld所駕五二五飛霞廠車“5252S”GiatTourere竟能得獲錦標。名列第一。各廠名車。均爲所敗。其成績之優。亦大足驚人矣。聞此種新車。售價自金洋一·五○○元至三·○○○元。亦非高貴。而同時駕車之萊寗斐爾德。亦獲一九三○年波斯汽車協會之全國競賽會奬章云。</p>

<p>路口設置警燈。便利交通。保障公安。欲其發生效騐。警燈地位。必須顯明。記號務求簡明。易於議别。美國工程局最近調查一百數十大城（人口約各五萬）之路牌。警燈與記號情形。據美國通用汽車製造總廠之新聞社報告。略記於下。</p>
<p>準確之記號。對於駕車者大有協助。關於閙市車務管理。更其重要。路號求其簡單。地位求其顯明。例如字意清楚。顔色標準。形式一例。地位適當種種。均須詳加考研。致於路口黏貼雜亂牌紙。未得當局批准者。禁止招貼。應加扯去。</p>
<p>不論路號如何顯明。若不認眞施行。毫無統系。結果必敗。其他路號。勢受影響。失其效用。</p>
<p>據報告所得。製造路牌記號之質料。亦須愼加選擇。用鑠鐵片或鑠鋼板或木料等均可。外鍍磁漆。求其優美耐用與價額公道者。</p>
<p>各種路號。日夜均須明亮。夜來以燈光明之。方法甚多。較爲完善者。莫如路牌面前懸以電燈或用透明燈與反光燈。視各地情形而定之。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Committee of Nanjing City previously requested the Central Government to interpret whether the policy guidelines of the provincial government should first be reviewed by the Provincial Supervisory Committee, and if they are first submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and record, whether the Provincial Supervisory Committee has the power to review them afterwards. The reply has now been received, stating that the general regulations stipulate that the Supervisory Committee's review of the policy guidelines of the government at the same level is meant to ensure that the government's policy guidelines are consistent with the party's program and policies. However, the party and government systems are separate, and the exercise of this power naturally has its own distinctions. Since the policy guidelines of various levels of government do not need to be approved by the party department before they can be implemented, submitting them to the superior government for approval and record is one matter, and the review by the Supervisory Committee is another. The order of the timing does not matter. Even if the policy guidelines of various levels of government have been approved and recorded by the superior government, the Supervisory Committee still has the power to review them.

<h3 id="e19">Large-Scale Demonstration in Hungary <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>At a time when rumors of restoration are rampant in Hungary, a large-scale demonstration of 15,000 people suddenly occurred. According to telegram reports, the movement originated from the Social Democratic Party protesting the government's failure to address the unemployment problem, announcing a general strike, and clashing with the police, resulting in a large-scale demonstration and a bloody tragedy. Given Hungary's financial strain and the people's economic downturn, especially during commercial decline and dwindling tax revenue, it is understandable that the government is at a loss for what to do about the unemployment problem. The people's anger being aroused by the government's lack of solutions is also logical. Moreover, at the beginning of the Horthy government's autocracy, there were many violent groups that enjoyed making trouble for others. Some vestiges of that remain today. Therefore, when the Social Democratic Party raises its voice today, the number of people who gather without being expected is so large. Or is it that the Habsburg royal family's conspiracy to restore has been brewing for several years, and the rumors of Otto taking the throne are spreading more and more widely? So the people are using this demonstration to show a warning, or are there even restoration party members taking the opportunity to mix in and take advantage of it to cause trouble? If today's event is solely for the unemployment problem, it is enough to make the government unable to cope. If it also involves other political and factional meanings, I am afraid it will be even more difficult to handle. The position in which Hungary finds itself is very difficult. Not only do the Little Entente countries pay attention to it at all times, but since the rumors of restoration began, some countries have expressed opposition, but there have also been those who secretly help. If this unemployment wave has not subsided and the restoration is realized, the resulting disputes will be difficult to predict. It would be fortunate for people if today's turmoil can be extinguished immediately.</p>

Furthermore, because this matter is related to the tariff portions of the commercial treaties concluded with various countries, it is still necessary to refer to the principles of the commercial treaties concluded with various countries, so the procedures are very complicated, and the date of promulgation is still difficult to determine.

<h3 id="e56">Hungarian Public Demonstration <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Protesting Government's Poor Handling of Unemployment</p>
<p>Armed Police Suppression Leads to Bloodshed</p>
<p>Reuters, Hungarian Capital, 1st - The leader of the Social Democratic Party today announced a general strike to protest the Hungarian government's failure to address the unemployment problem. The authorities banned the march, and conflicts arose between the public and the police. About 10,000 people shouted slogans such as "Bread and Work" and "Down with the Bourgeoisie," and then poured into the streets, destroying shop windows and streetcars. The police initially used bayonets to drive them away, but later had to open fire to restore order. Some shops and homes were looted. Armed vehicles are now patrolling the streets. The demonstration stopped in the afternoon, with one dead and fifty injured.</p>
<p>Reuters, Hungarian Capital, 2nd - After yesterday's riots and bloodshed, the Hungarian capital is now under martial law. Armed vehicles and machine guns are visible everywhere. At least two people have died and hundreds have been injured, some of whom are bound to die from serious injuries. Two policemen were also seriously injured. According to official estimates, about 15,000 to 20,000 people participated in yesterday's demonstration. A total of 200 people have been arrested. This is the most violent disturbance in Hungary in the past ten years.</p>
<p>National News, Hungarian Capital, 1st - A public march initiated by the Socialist Party here was attended by about 60,000 people, but discipline was lacking. From the beginning, there were attempts to rob shops and residences. Mounted police came out to suppress and chase them away. The crowd threw stones and coal at them. Finally, the police chief ordered to open fire, and the crowd dispersed. As a result, dozens of people were seriously injured, and it is estimated that several people died. The situation in the afternoon was quite serious. Armored vehicles patrolled the thoroughfares, and the army was also ordered to prepare everything. However, the authorities are confident that they can resist the situation. Afterwards, the leaders of the Socialist Party solemnly denied any intention to use the public to riot, and it is expected that extreme elements will have mixed in to take advantage of the opportunity to cause trouble.</p>

<p>Horn Reports Discovery Process</p>
<p>National News Agency, Tromsø, 1st - The whaling ship Bratvaag, flying a half-mast flag, carrying the remains of Arctic explorer Andrée and his companions, arrived here tonight, exactly ten days after the Horn expedition discovered them. The remains are stored under a tarpaulin on the rear deck, with ice placed on top to prevent decay. They will be moved to the local hospital after dawn. Except for the special commissioners of the Swedish government and representatives of the local authorities, other welcomers were not allowed to board the ship to see them. Yesterday, when the ship docked at Skjervøy Harbor near Hammerfest, the leader of the Horn expedition sent an official report telegraph, 2,000 words long, and news reporters who had specially visited the port also sent telegraphs one after another, causing the small town's telegraph office staff to work all night, busier than ever before in their lives. National News Agency, Stockholm, 1st - The Daipaertai newspaper reported that the conversation of Horn, the leader of the Horn expedition that discovered Andrée's remains, differed greatly from the news previously reported. It is said that the remains of Andrée and others, except for a small amount of frozen and unrotted meat, were only bones. There were signs of polar bears trampling in their tents. Only the surname of Andrée was known from the diary in his pocket, so it seems doubtful whether his remains can be preserved with medicinal water. After careful arrangement of the diary, the details of his experience may be examined. Judging from the broken state of their clothes and the shape of the sleds and boats, it seems that Andrée and others arrived at the place where they camped on White Island after a long trek. It seems that they arrived on White Island in September. The ammunition they carried must have been full, and they hunted birds along the way to survive. As the weather became colder and colder, they froze to death. This time, a loaded rifle, a small stove, and a small food container were found next to Andrée's remains. A piece of leftover meat was still in the container. The bodies of the two companions were 40 feet away. The remains and tents were covered in snow. Fortunately, an oar was exposed outside the snow, which made it possible to discover them. If a suitable expedition team is organized to go to White Island again in the future, it may be possible to make further discoveries.

<h3 id="e59">Fierce Questioning and Debate <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Touching on the Central Issue of Command Authority</p>
<p>Government at a Loss for Words and in a Difficult Situation</p>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd - The fifth meeting of the Privy Council's detailed investigation committee was held at 1:00 PM yesterday. The intensity of the questioning exceeded expectations, and it is believed to have caused considerable damage to the government. First, General Kawai, who came from the military and had a direct relationship with the issue of command authority, began questioning, assisted by Arai and Kaneko. Chairman Ito also used the pretext of procedural matters to speak and pursue the government closely from time to time. Despite the hot weather, the debate lasted for three hours and ten minutes, causing Prime Minister Hamaguchi, Minister of Finance Okabe, and the Minister of the Navy to be in a dilemma. The questioning began with a general discussion of principles, first asking "Does the determination of military strength require the consent of the military?" The Prime Minister replied that it was necessary to obtain the consent of the military. Then General Kawai entered the second stage of questioning. However, did the government obtain the consent of the military when deciding on the repatriation? The Prime Minister replied that consent had been largely obtained. General Kawai also raised the objection of former Minister of Military Affairs Kato, and the issue of the replacement of the Minister of Military Affairs, and questioned Minister of the Navy Okabe. Okabe then read the telegram sent by former Minister Kato when the repatriation was sent, saying "The repatriation has been sent and cannot be reversed. In the future, I hope to make more efforts on the accommodation of ship types and other points." Okabe then explained based on this telegram that former Minister Kato was not opposed. However, the three committee members Kawai, Arai, and Kaneko, as well as Chairman Ito, considered this explanation insufficient, so they could not agree to it in the end. General Kawai further requested Minister of the Navy Okabe to present all the telegrams back and forth. If he could not, it would be difficult to progress with the deliberation. He also questioned Prime Minister Hamaguchi, saying that Minister of the Navy Okabe and the Minister of Military Affairs had exchanged memoranda on the issue of command authority. What was the necessity of this? The Prime Minister replied that this was an internal matter of the military and had nothing to do with the government. General Kawai further questioned Minister of the Navy Okabe, saying that Minister of the Navy Okabe had signed the treaty with full power, but why did he admit that there was a shortage of military strength when he returned to the country and held a military council? He strongly criticized the Navy Minister's dual personality. The Navy Minister was almost at a loss for words and sweated profusely. Although he perfunctorily got through it for a while, the meeting of that day had caused great damage to the government. The sixth meeting of the Committee on Detailed Investigation is scheduled to continue at 1:00 PM tomorrow, and there will inevitably be a more in-depth debate.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 1st - General Heye, the Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, issued a statement today to deny rumors, stating that his retirement this autumn is only because he has served in the army for 42 years, his energy is declining, and he wants to hand over the army to someone younger to lead. There is absolutely no political meaning. He dares to guarantee that the German army will abide by the principles set by the Minister of National Defense. To say that he has his own diplomatic policy is purely confusing. He firmly believes that the army is completely loyal to the country and the people.</p>

<p>Associated Press, San Francisco, 1st - The Committee on Trade with China, chaired by Mr. Bitterman, solicited opinions from prominent people and concluded its work today. Many people made suggestions on improving the trade situation with China, but all of them required huge sums of money. However, everyone believes that there is no hope for a turnaround in commerce unless the Chinese civil war ends. Former Senator Conlon advocated a fundamental global cooperative policy on the need for gold and silver, saying that the decline in silver prices has reduced the purchasing power of the entire Asian continent by 3%. Conlon also attributed the low price of silver to the UK and France's maximal storage of gold. Mr. Isla of San Francisco quite agreed with this.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Letter of Commendation from the Central Executive Committee to Soldiers and Civilians in the War Zone <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Commissioners Dai and Liu Taken to the Front Lines for Distribution</p>
<p>The Central Executive Committee previously dispatched Commissioners Dai Chuanxian and Liu Jiwen to the front lines to commend the troops and distribute the "Letter of Commendation to All Soldiers" and the "Letter of Commendation to Civilians in the War Zone." Commissioners Dai and Liu took these letters to the front lines and war zones for distribution. The original texts are recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter of Commendation to All Soldiers Brave and loyal armed comrades, we are campaigning against Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, who have brought disaster to the country by raising troops and rebelling. You have worked hard in battle and suffered great sacrifices. The Central Government will not forget your merits and your bravery, and neither will the people of the whole country. The Central Government has specially sent Commissioners Dai Chuanxian and Liu Jiwen to the front to commend you and express our fullest respect. If all the Chinese people are to be able to survive in the world, there must be genuine unification. Without unification, it will be impossible to improve politics internally or safeguard national rights externally, and the people's suffering cannot be alleviated. Not only will we have no way out, but all our compatriots will have no way out. Yan Xishan is the running dog of the Hongxian Emperor, and Feng Yuxiang is the remnant of the Northern Warlords. They are both culprits in destroying unification, and they both want to drive the people of the whole country to their death. Therefore, we must suppress these rebels and fundamentally eliminate them. The Central Government is determined to suppress the rebels, so it has specially ordered Commander-in-Chief Chiang to personally supervise the army and lead the troops to the final victory. Since the dispatch of the troops, thanks to the loyalty and bravery of the officers and soldiers of the entire army, they have repeatedly won great victories, making the rebels terrified. The recent recapture of Jinan is not only the recapture of a provincial capital, but more importantly, the elimination of the main force of Yan Xishan's entire army, completely depriving him of his ability to fight. Feng Yuxiang's rebel army on the Longhai Railway was already half dead and wounded. Now, like rabbits mourning over the death of foxes, everyone is terrified. Moreover, Yan Xishan is unable to save himself and has no strength to supply them with bullets and food. Their bullets will be used up one by one, and their food will be eaten one day less. Therefore, their ability to fight will also decrease day by day. Their doomsday is predictable. As long as we muster our courage, it will not be difficult to eliminate all the enemies. Of course, we also know that our loyal and brave soldiers are too tired, but the rebels' suffering is ten times a hundred times greater than ours. The final victory is the price of all our hardships. Only with the final victory can the country have genuine unification. Only then can the country have lasting peace and genuine construction. Only then can the Three Principles of the People be realized, and all the Chinese people be able to survive in the world. The final victory is in front of you, and the glory of the world and the reputation of history are waiting for you. At that time, the whole country will celebrate your triumphant return. Now, we would like to express our sincere condolences to you. The Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>
<p>Letter of Condolence to the People in the War Zone Unfortunately, after the completion of unification, the remnants of the Northern Warlords, Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, rebelled again. The Central Government had no choice but to use force to suppress them. In the areas where fighting took place in Henan and Shandong, our dear people suffered from the cruelty of the rebels, the deaths and injuries from artillery fire, and were reduced to a state of wives and children being separated, families being destroyed, fields not being cultivated, and food not being eaten. The Central Government knows about all kinds of miserable and painful situations, and none of them are not considered by the Central Government to be the most heartbreaking thing. The Central Government of the People's Republic is the people's. The Central Government sympathizes with our suffering people to an indescribable extent. Therefore, it has specially sent Commissioners Dai Chuanxian and Liu Jiwen to the war zone to express their condolences. Our dear and kind people must ask why the National Revolution led by the Chinese Kuomintang is not said to have succeeded, and why the National Government is not said to have unified China. Why do we still have to suffer this kind of pain? You don't know that the National Revolution has not been completely successful. Why? It is because Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang are obstructing and sabotaging it. They treat the country's land as their own territory, the country's wealth as their own private property, and the country's army as their own domestic slaves. They ask for money every day and prepare for war every day, so that not only can the country do nothing, but the people themselves cannot manage anything. Internal affairs cannot be improved due to various constraints, and taxes cannot be reduced because of preparations for war in all aspects. The imperialists, seeing that China does not have a whole strength, cannot retreat and allow us to abolish the unequal treaties. What is most heartbreaking is that when the unification was completed last year, the Central Government saw that the people in the northern provinces, especially the northwestern areas, were unable to survive due to natural disasters and man-made disasters, so it did its best and united with enthusiastic charitable compatriots at home and abroad to raise huge sums of money to engage in disaster relief. The relief funds raised were no less than ten million, and this kind of money and food for relieving the lives of disaster victims in the north was all detained and intercepted by Feng Yuli as his military pay and food, and he used this relief money to prepare for rebellion. Not only did he let the people in the north starve to death, but he also wanted to break the unified peace that the country had already achieved. Not only that, Feng Yuxiang</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>On the one hand, he intercepted the Central Government's relief money for disaster victims to prepare for rebellion. On the other hand, he colluded with Soviet Russia and contacted the Communist Party to endanger China. Therefore, last year, while Feng Yuxiang was raising troops in the northwest, Soviet Russia invaded the northeast, and at the same time, the bandits who had been suppressed in various parts of the Yangtze River took the opportunity to steal and launch attacks. Their actions were coordinated. Under this situation of armed robbery and kidnapping of the people by the bandits and warlords, if we continue to be generous and tolerant, it will be like raising a scourge. The Chinese people will really perish together. The peace of any country or dynasty must be achieved by eliminating this kind of evil force. Our current situation cannot be an exception. Therefore, for the sake of the survival of the nation and long-term stability, when the two rebels, Ge and Feng, raised troops and caused chaos, the Central Government specially ordered Commander-in-Chief Chiang to lead a large army to personally suppress them. Therefore, everyone should have the following three clear understandings of this war: First, this is a war for the Three Principles of the People against feudal forces. Second, this is a war of the national military against private military forces. Third, this is a war for national unification against separatist warlords. Speaking of unification, it is the root cause of curing all current diseases. Without unification, the warlords will permanently maintain private military forces to harm the country and the people, and the Three Principles of the People will never be realized. The Central Government also knows that war is an unfortunate thing, but fighting to suppress rebels is a last resort. As the ancients said, "When a poisonous snake bites your hand, a strong man cuts off his arm." This is the truth. Don't misunderstand this as an internal struggle of the Chinese Kuomintang just because you see the two rebels Yan and Feng also hiding under the banner of the Blue Sky and White Sun. You should understand that Yan Xishan was originally the running dog of the Hongxian Emperor, and Feng Yuxiang was originally the remnant of the Northern Warlords. How could they know about the Chinese Kuomintang, let alone the Three Principles of the People? They are only using the name of the Chinese Kuomintang and the banner of the Blue Sky and White Sun to cover themselves and confuse the public's eyes. As for the remaining rebellious party members and frustrated politicians, they rely on them for their own rights. It is really like selling themselves into slavery, extremely shameless. Once the warlords fail, they can see the ugly scene of the trees falling and the monkeys scattering. The Central Government has made the final determination and greatest effort in suppressing the rebels this time. Fortunately, since the dispatch of the troops, our soldiers have been exceptionally brave and have repeatedly won great victories. Recently, they captured Jinan. This is not only the recapture of a provincial capital, but also the elimination of the main force of Yan Xishan's army after a major battle, leaving them no chance to recover. Feng Yuxiang's main force has already been wiped out by more than half. Like rabbits mourning over the death of foxes, they will soon be wiped out. Moreover, Yan Xishan is unable to save himself and has no strength to supply them with guns, ammunition, and food. Therefore, after the recapture of Jinan, international and domestic eyes immediately shifted over, recognizing the strength of the Central Army and the collapse of the rebellious party is imminent. The final victory belongs to the Central Government. During the war, the Central Army received help from the people in the war zone, such as the Guidetuan militia, the guerrillas in various places, and all the other helpful people. Their loyalty and bravery are what we should sincerely comfort. We hope that this kind of help will continue to be given. If your relatives and friends are forced by circumstances to work in the rebel army, we hope that you will earnestly persuade them to return to us. The Central Government will certainly not blame them for the past, but will sincerely employ them. In short, everyone should help the Central Army win the victory sooner, so that the military affairs will end sooner. The sooner the military affairs end, the sooner the country will be unified. This will not only relieve your current urgent pain, but also help the people of the whole country relieve their long-term pain. As long as the military affairs end and the unification is completed, the Central Government will definitely devote all its strength to refresh politics and create a new situation for politics. Not only the people in our war zone, but also the people of the whole country, will be able to live and work in peace. Everyone should work together to create a new path for the Chinese nation.

<h3 id="e70">Dai Douyuan Murdered in Liuyang <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Liu Yijing Acting as Commander of the 47th Brigade</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: This time, He Jian abandoned Liuyang, claiming to lure the bandits deep and retreat to Changsha to defend the suburban fortresses and fortresses, which caused great panic in the Changsha market, and people fled abroad one after another. The only reason for this was due to Dai Douyuan's disastrous defeat in Wenjiashi, Liuyang. Dai was the leader of the Xiangxi military circles, and is currently the deputy commander of the 16th Division and commander of the 47th Brigade. This time, he set out from the province to Liuyang to pursue Peng Huang, and was appointed as the commander of the Third Column. He led Tian Yingtang, Liu Yijing, Xu Chuanshu, Wu Xie, and Zhou's four regiments to advance to the Gan border on the right wing. On August 20, they were surrounded by bandits in Wenjiashi, east of Liuyang, and almost the entire army was wiped out. This was the biggest and most disastrous defeat since the Fourth Route Army fought. The life and death of Dai and other officers were unknown at the time, so He Jian ordered a retreat to lure the bandits deep. More than a week has passed since then. In recent days, there have been rumors that Dai has been killed, that he has broken out and fled to Liling, and that Dai has committed suicide with a pistol. The rumors are divergent and inconsistent. Yesterday, Dai's orderly and deputy staff members, many of whom successively bypassed Liling and fled to the provincial capital to report everything to He Jian, only to learn that Dai had indeed died in battle. At the same time, Regiment Commander Tian Yingtang was also brutally killed. According to reports, Brigade Commander Dai camped in Wenjiashi on the 20th. The city is surrounded by mountains, which is extremely dangerous. That night, he received a report that the Communist bandits would attack at dawn the next day. Dai ordered all units to eat at 1:00 in the evening and attack the bandits at 2:00 first. When it was about 1:00, the units were eating when the Communist bandits suddenly surrounded them from the mountains on all sides. At that time, the surrounding forces were divided into ways to meet the enemy, and they fought fiercely for a day, charging thirty or forty times. However, the bandits became more and more numerous, and our army had no external assistance, so it was difficult to break out. The machine guns exploded seven or eight times due to prolonged sweeping and excessive firepower. Until the evening, Brigade Commander Dai personally led Regiment Tian Yingtang to break through a corner and escaped, but he was shot in the leg and could not walk. The orderly then carried Dai and ran desperately. The bandits chased from behind, and Dai was shot in the shoulder again. Dai knew that there was no hope of survival, so he immediately shouted for the orderly to put him down and order him to fire another shot to die early and reduce the pain. The orderlies cried loudly and refused to shoot. Dai ordered the orderly to hand over the gun to him in order to commit suicide. The orderlies still cried and refused. While hesitating, the bandits had caught up. Dai and his entourage were surrounded, disarmed, and brutally killed. Those who escaped quickly were only a hundred or two hundred people. Regiment Commander Tian Yingtang was shot six times at the same time. After falling to the ground, the bandits stabbed him with spears, and his body was riddled with wounds. He died immediately. Now the bodies of Dai and Tian have not been found. In addition, the three regiments of Liu Yijing, Xu Chuanshu, Wu Xie, and Zhou were able to break through until the next morning and return via Liling, but they had lost more than half of their troops. There were only more than two thousand people left, with only more than a thousand guns. Fortunately, the three regimental commanders Liu and others were unharmed. When He Jian received the report, he lost an arm and cried again and again. He has now ordered Liu Yijing to temporarily act as the commander of the 47th Brigade of the 16th Division, and lead the troops to Ningxiang to reorganize</p>
<p>Waiting for orders. As for the military deployment in the provincial capital of Changsha, it is indeed very solid. In the area of ​​ten miles in the suburbs, from Xinhe, starting directly from Datopu Yijiawan, extending for fifty or sixty miles, all are dug trenches. Electric wires are also laid outside the trenches, and bamboo nails and other obstacles are planted outside the wires. Although the Communist bandits are numerous, it is difficult for them to fly over. It is heard that He Jian plans to use the strength of the Nineteenth and Fifteenth Divisions to defend the trenches, and the Thirty-first Division Tao Guang's unit and the Independent Fifth Brigade Chen Guangzhong's unit as the right-wing assault force, concentrated in Datopu Yijiawan, twenty or thirty miles above Changsha, waiting for orders. The Twenty-second Division Luo Lin's unit is the left-wing assault force, concentrated in Laoshe River Xia Ninggang, twenty or thirty miles below Changsha. Once the Communist bandits pounce on the provincial capital, the left and right wings will come out and encircle them, in order to wipe them out in one fell swoop. However, in the past two days, the Communist bandits have not attacked. According to secret agent reports, the bandits intend to change their attack from the two wings because the frontal defenses are solid. Zhu Mao's unit detoured from Liuyang to Zhuzhou to peep at Changsha, and Peng Huang detoured from Pingjiang to Gaoqiao to attack Changsha. When He Jian received the report, he immediately ordered Tao, Chen, and Luo's units to pay attention to blocking and suppressing them. However, as of the morning of the 30th, the bandits have not been seen to attack, so there has been no contact. In my opinion, the strength of the Communist bandits is only a few thousand. The provincial capital is crowded with large armies, and they may not dare to try to make a show. (August 30)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Communist Bandit Fang Zhimin Captures Poyang <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Lu Diping Mobilizes Large Army to Suppress</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Gan East Communist chief Fang Zhimin Shao Shiping, after capturing Leping, divided into land and water routes to attack Raozhou. It is found that Raozhou is 180 miles away from the province, and can be reached by steamboat in one day. It is an important town in Gan East, located on the shore of Poyang Lake. In recent years, the Fang bandits have窜扰信江饶河 watersheds in Gan East, only Poyang has not been poisoned. Therefore, wealthy gentry from Yiyang Dexing Leping Wannian Yujiang Guixi and Hukou counties have mostly taken refuge in Poyang. This time, when the Fang bandits attacked from Le, the county magistrate of the county, Jiang Bozhang, (concurrently served as the commander of the Second District) telegraphed the province for emergency help and supervised the county's guards to set off to meet the enemy. At the junction of Po and Le, they fought fiercely for several days and nights. However, the Fang bandits attacked with their entire nest. There were more than a thousand guns, and thousands of Red Guards peasant self-defense forces and spear squads. Machine guns and mortars were also prepared, and they charged back and forth, very fiercely. The county's guards retreated to a place 20 miles away from the county seat on the 24th due to the disparity in strength. They defended themselves dangerously. The Fang bandits still led their teams to chase fiercely. Machine guns and mortars fired like rain. The county's guards retreated again because they ran out of ammunition and were isolated from reinforcements. The county seat was captured by the bandits on the 26th. In the past two days, those who fled from the county to the province have been endless. The executive committee members of the county party department, Deng Tianlai and Chen Richu, went to the Provincial Government's Ninth Route Army Department and the Provincial Bandit Suppression Department yesterday to petition for the speedy dispatch of a large army for rescue. It is heard that Lu Diping has telegraphed the 18th Division stationed in Yujiang to rush to suppress the bandits, and ordered the Mo Si and Ke Sai combat aircraft to fly to reconnaissance and throw bombs. The two aircraft flew to Pocheng on the 28th and dropped several 60-pound bombs. At the same time, the Jiang Xi and Min Zu shallow-water warships sent by the Navy Department also advanced to Poyang Lake to suppress the bandits. (August 29)</p>

<p>Ge Jingen Leaves Qingdao to the South</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The newly appointed Qingdao Mayor Hu Ruoyu was recently urged by the National Government, so he set off south on the Zhenhai warship from Beidaihe at 12:00 am on the 30th of last month. He arrived in Qingdao at 10:00 am today (1st). He landed at the Qianhai pier. Representatives from all party and government agencies in the city were dispatched to the coast to welcome him. Hu's entourage had arrived in Qingdao earlier to prepare everything. This time, he only brought two secretaries and four orderlies. It is heard that because the former Mayor Ge Jingen had already gone south, Hu decided to take office first today and officially hold the inauguration ceremony tomorrow (2nd). He has appointed Hu Jiafeng as the secretary-general of the municipal government. The directors of the finance and port affairs bureaus have also been internally decided and can be announced during the day. Also, the director of the Public Security Bureau, Yu Jinhe, has submitted his resignation, which has been approved. However, no new appointment has been made yet. It is said that it will be concurrently held by Zhang Xueming, the commander of the Qingdao Garrison, or it is said that it will be Guan Buxiao, or Chai Mou. It will probably be officially announced within one or two days. The former Mayor Ge Jingen, because Mayor Hu came to Qingdao, and someone in the municipal government is responsible, in addition to ordering Secretary-General Wang Xi to stay in Qingdao to handle the handover, Ge himself took the Tianjin Maru to Shanghai and then to Beijing at 8:00 am today. Also, the Director of the Finance Bureau, Lu Quan, resigned, and Fan Huigui was temporarily appointed as the agent. The Director of the Port Affairs Bureau, Zheng Zhaojing, resigned, and Lu Bai was appointed as the agent to wait for the handover. Lu and Zheng also went to Shanghai with Ge on the same ship.

<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuqu, because Jinan has just been recaptured, and there are bound to be reactionary elements lurking, specially summoned Garrison Commander Sun Tongxuan, Chief of the Military Law Department Li Wuchen, Director of the Public Security Bureau Wang Zunwu, and Licheng County Magistrate Zhou Zongyao to the General Headquarters at 8:00 am on the 29th to discuss the Jinan clearing campaign method. As a result, it was decided that the Public Security Bureau would be responsible for handling it in Jinan City, and the Licheng County Government would be responsible for the four passes and rural areas. First, County Magistrate Zhou Zongyao will organize a clearing campaign committee, and each of the four bureaus of the county will send a preparatory committee member to participate. It is scheduled to be established within three days. The committee stipulates 60 people, divided into 30 groups, to supervise the district and street chiefs to investigate the household registration. The garrison headquarters will first investigate the household registration in the city and town.

<h3 id="e74">Zhejiang Security Team Recaptures Yushan <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Gan bandit Peng Jianzhang, colluded with the reactionary army Hui Cengtuan,窜扰 Guangxin Yushan and other counties, hoping to peep at the Zhejiang border. After the Zhejiang Provincial Government received the telegram from Gan Chairman Lu Diping, it ordered Zhu Wutao, the commander of the third regiment of the security team, to lead his troops to Changshan to block and suppress them as the opportunity arose. At the same time, it also sent a teaching group to assist in the suppression. After Zhu's group arrived in Changshan, in order to preemptively attack, Zhu's commander personally led his troops from Changshan on the 29th of last month. The first battalion of the regiment, Jiang Zhiying, and all the soldiers of the battalion, and two platoons of machine guns and mortars, reached the west gate of Yushan at 4:00 am on the 30th, and immediately launched a fierce attack on the bandits. The bandits also resisted stubbornly, fighting fiercely for more than four hours, charging more than ten times, and attacking the headquarters of the pseudo commander Ceng Peng. The bandits were defeated and retreated, one part窜上了 Rao, and the other part窜上广丰. Six or seventy bandits were killed. They are still chasing in separate ways. As for the Wenzhou border, the Min bandit He Jinbiao's troops had repeatedly peeped at it before, but they were not successful because of strict defense. This time, they took advantage of the provincial army's attention to the Gan bandits, colluded with local bandits,窜上泰顺, forcing Pingyang. The fourth regiment of the Yongjia security team could not send troops to suppress them because they were restrained by the Xinanxi bandits. After receiving the report, the provincial government immediately telegraphed the sixth and seventh regiments of the security team to rush to Wenzhou to defend and suppress them. On one side, the Zhenhai Fortress Command dispatched two warships to rush to Wenzhou by sea to assist in the suppression. Once the troops from all directions arrive, they will join forces to encircle and suppress them, and it will not be difficult to suppress them.</p>

<p>District Chiefs' Joint Meeting Record The county government convened a joint meeting of district chiefs yesterday to discuss and decide on events: (1) The Finance Bureau was ordered to solicit customs tax and labor cases. Because the county has had poor harvests and the people are in poverty for many years, it is now planned to change the method. The Finance Bureau will issue a receipt and order the rejection of borrowing from various industries to offset it. The two yuan of extra grain tax will be restored to offset it, and all of it will be solved as scheduled. On one side, the county will circulate to all districts and summon the township police to earnestly persuade. (1) The administrative expenses of each district are ordered to be reduced. The district chiefs proposed temporarily and resolved to ask the county government to consider the difficulties of the districts in handling affairs. The new budget will be postponed for implementation and disbursements will still be made according to the old plan.</p>
<p>The First District Plans to Build a New West Baidu Bridge The main roads in the area of the First District Office have been leveled and repaired, and the tributary back street bridges and roads have been repaired for more than one-third. However, the Xiunan Bridge outside the west and the West Baidu are busy with traffic, and the ferryboats at West Baidu are quite inconvenient. Therefore, gentlemen Lei Junyan, Du Shizhou, Wu Chengfu, etc., initiated the construction of a new cement bridge. The district office convened a meeting of all sectors of society. Because the project is huge, it is a pioneering initiative in Songcheng. For the sake of prudence, a bridge construction committee was formed to preside over the handling. It is heard that the project cost is about five or six thousand gold. In addition to the subsidy from the district office, the rest will be undertaken by Lei Jun and others to raise funds.</p>

<p>Implementation Methods of the Five-County Joint Defense: The Civil Affairs Department has ordered the five-county joint defense to be implemented. County Magistrate Shen Qingchen of this county has scheduled a meeting for discussion on September 6th, and instructed to first prepare detailed methods for review. Therefore, County Magistrate Shen has already consulted with Jinshan, Nanhui, Shangyu, and Songjiang counties, requesting their attendance at the time. In addition, detailed implementation methods for the joint defense plan will be formulated for compliance. Besides the coastal area, which is vast and difficult to manage, the Songchang Salt Police Bureau and the Suzhou Customs Anti-Smuggling Department will be jointly assisted. For the border areas inland, inspection stations will be established to specialize in investigation. At Zhangjiatang and other places bordering Songjiang, Nanhui, Fengxian, and Shangyu counties, which are particularly important locations, several police officers will be transferred from the public security bureaus of the respective counties to form a joint police station for garrisoning.</p>
<p>Police Team Captures Bandits: Yang Xingsheng, the squad leader of the Second Police Platoon stationed in the village, received a tip-off that bandits led by Xie Youcai and others were planning to rob in partnership at Yanduntou. He ordered plainclothes officers to secretly investigate in Tinglin Town, Songjiang County, a neighboring area, the day before yesterday. They were captured in a certain cigarette shop. However, one of the bandits' accomplices was said to be a water police patrolman, which led to a misunderstanding and almost caused a conflict. The local public security sub-bureau detained both parties together. Yesterday evening, Squad Leader Yang prepared proof to welcome them back for interrogation. According to their confession, they had a meeting at Li Jiasheng's and Xia Laohu's houses in Huan'an, with a total of twenty-four people. They elected Xia Zexian as their leader and each contributed forty-five yuan to purchase Mauser rifles for use. However, they did not directly disclose their actions. "We only know that they will gather in Yanduntou in a few days to kidnap several senior members of a certain butcher shop and a certain flower shop." Several accomplices they confessed have also been successively arrested by Captain Yang this morning, including Gu Meilin. The suspect was previously arrested and released on bail for suspicion in the Zhuanghang arson case. He has now admitted that he went to the home of Dai Xiaocai, a co-criminal who has already been executed, with Tofu Afu at the end of June in the lunar calendar to purchase a Browning pistol. Therefore, Captain Yang has transferred the two bandits to the county for investigation. As for the 53 yuan found on the spot, it is planned to use it to cover the investigation costs of this case, and the rest will be used as reward money.</p>

<p>Robbery and Murder Case in the Fifth District: More than ten bandits, each holding a handgun, suddenly came to Zhou Haoda's house in Zhanghaiqiao, Fifth District, Wuyi, on the 30th. After entering the house, the bandit leader demanded a hundred yuan from Haoda, otherwise, "I will take you outside to talk." Haoda refused. The bandit leader twisted him outside and shot him with a handgun, hitting a vital spot, and he fell to the ground and died immediately. Then the bandit leader led the crowd into the house to search and rob, and then left triumphantly. Today (the 2nd), news came that the bandit leader in this case was Jin, who had previously led a crowd to rob and kill people in Tangjia. He has been hiding in Shanghai for a long time and has now sneaked back to commit crimes again. It can be said that he is extremely bold.

<p>Bandits Rob and Shoot the Victim: Zhang Guoliang, a 54-year-old farmer from Shengdianqiao, Niandou Jiutu, Seventeenth District (Fuan Township), was robbed by seven or eight bandits who spoke in a strong northern accent and each held a handgun. First, one bandit climbed over the wall and entered the house, opened the gate, and let in four or five bandits. Two bandits stood guard outside the gate. After the bandits entered the room, they tied up Zhang's eldest son, Jin Dayong, and then searched wildly, and tied up Zhang Guoliang's wife, and ordered her to keep quiet. At that time, Guoliang secretly took a police gong, climbed onto the roof, and rang the gong for help. The bandits were furious and fired seven or eight shots at Guoliang. He could not dodge in time and was hit by three shots. Blood flowed like a fountain, and he fell on the roof. The bandits searched for half an hour before carrying the stolen goods away. It is estimated that the cash, jewelry, clothes, etc. that were robbed were worth about 60-70 yuan. Yesterday morning, the victim Zhang Guoliang hired a boat with his son to the city to go to the Brothers Hospital for treatment.

<p>Urgent Progress in Conscripting Labor to Build Roads: The Construction Bureau of Xiyi County was ordered to carry out conscription of labor to build roads. The original plan was to implement the conscription on April 18, and first build the Xichang Provincial Road. Later, due to the summer farming season, it was postponed until after the autumn harvest. Recently, Yao Dixing, the director of the Construction Bureau, believed that the autumn harvest was approaching, and it was necessary to continue the previous achievements, and to subsidize the Huanhu Avenue project so that it could be completed as soon as possible. He specially planned to build the Xiyi Provincial Road first, and then the Xichang Provincial Road after the Xiyi was completed. However, the Xiyi route has been changed since it was measured and notified by the Highway Bureau. All sections from Xuxiang to Panjiaqiao have been changed to walk along the lake. However, there are continuous mountains and few villages within ten miles along the route. It is feared that difficulties will inevitably arise when conscripting labor in the future. Director Yao submitted a report to County Magistrate Pan yesterday, requesting that it be forwarded to the Construction Department for review and handling.</p>

<p>Victim Escapes from the Chaoni Beach: Xu Ruilin and other four people who were robbed and kidnapped in Chaoni Beach were suddenly intercepted by soldiers of the Jiahu Bandit Suppression Commander Hang Yi, patrolmen of the Second Water Police District, and the Smuggling Suppression Camp. No less than fifty or sixty bandits were killed on the spot, and four victims were rescued. Xu Ruilin, a wealthy household in Chaoni Beach in our county, was also among them.

<p>Reasons for the Resignation of the Members of the Chamber of Commerce Consolidated Organization Committee: The members of the Jiaxing County Merchant Unified Organization Committee had just taken the oath of office on August 25 and took over the County Chamber of Commerce and the County Merchants Association to work hard. It is now learned that the members are quite critical of the content of the reply from County Magistrate Jiang Zhicheng to the County Government Secretary Fang Zhuangyou and the County Public Security Bureau Chief Mo Runxun on the case of being accused of arresting soldiers. In particular, they obliterate the facts of the arrest and protect their subordinates, and there are many words that insult merchants. They believe that the business movement is hopeless and they are ashamed of the people. On the 1st, at the third regular meeting, this case was first proposed and resolved: (1) All members resigned to the Provincial Party Department, the Provincial Chamber of Commerce Consolidated Organization Committee, and the County Party Department. (2) Request the Department of Civil Affairs to send special commissioners for reinvestigation. (3) Petition to the Fifth Congress of Representatives of this county.</p>
<p>The Wheel Bureau Requests Exemption from Education Fees: The Jiaxing County Education Property Association had previously resolved to collect an education fee of one point per ticket for each small wheel passenger ticket on the inner river to help fund elementary schools, and it has been approved by the Provincial Department to collect fees on a regular basis. The association had also convened the managers of the wheel bureaus to discuss the date of collection and the method of payment. However, few people attended, and the matter has not been resolved. It is now learned that the Education Property Association does not pursue or reorganize the original eroded properties, but only seeks to exploit the people's difficulties. Recently, it has decided to add two cents per tael/stone to the land tax subsidy for this year (this case has been implemented), and also add a certain amount to the slaughter tax. It also wants to add fees to commercial wheel passenger tickets. This is really ignoring the people's difficulties, and the fee collection regulations are also inconsistent. Therefore, the wheel bureaus jointly submitted a request to the provincial and county authorities on the 2nd, ordering the Education Property Association to stop the collection and revoke the original plan in order to comply with laws and regulations.</p>

<p>Strange Murder Case Discovered in Anting: Fu Pinhua of Wangjiacun, Liuhe, Taicang County, took his wife, Wang, from Shanghai to Anting by car the month before last, intending to take a wheel back to the village. They temporarily stayed in a small teahouse next to the station. Lu Jinzhang, a station worker, and others teased his wife. Her husband, Fu Pinhua, argued with them and was beaten as a result, and then disappeared. Later, it is not known what happened. Stationmaster Zhou Xichen detained Fu Wang and Zhou Peirong and Qiao A'er from the village and handed them over to the local security chief, who forwarded them to the district office and then to the county government, accusing Zhou et al. of forcing marriage without success and requesting an investigation. Chen Chengshen asked about the truth of the matter. Zhou confessed that the woman had fled to his house and there was no forced marriage. The woman also only confessed that she had been teased and that the couple had been beaten. The next day, the county government received a report from the Anting District Office that an unidentified male corpse was found in Chenjiabang in the southeast of the station. Trial Officer Zhang took Fu Wang to inspect the corpse and confirmed that the deceased was indeed her husband. Before his death, his chest and waist were fatally drowned. The suspect Lu Jinzhang was detained for interrogation. County Magistrate Chen believed that the stationmaster Zhou Xichen had fabricated the facts to exonerate the perpetrators and that it was necessary to summon him. He specially sent Zhu, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, to Shanghai on the 29th to contact the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration on everything. It is also heard that there have been multiple murder cases within this year in the Kunshan and Jiading counties near the station.</p>
<p>Detectives Search and Assault: Xu A'liu, a boatman, stole 220 bags of rough indica rice from the Shanghai Taikang Rice Shop that the shop had consigned for transport, and had the shop's employee Dai A'san grind them at the Xinsheng Rice Mill in Lujiabang, Qia Xinghe Rice Shop in Huangdu Town in the county. After the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau learned of this, it detained Dai A'san and sent detectives Su Sheng et al. to Jia for extradition with Dai A'san et al. County Magistrate Chen ordered Deng Jinglie, the police squad leader stationed in the town, to assist and detained Jiang Boqing, an employee of Qia Taihe Shop, and sent him to the county. At the same time, according to a report from the district office in the area, the detectives Su Sheng et al. broke into the Gongxing Commercial Firm in the town and searched it for no reason, and beat Tang Dekui, the shop's storekeeper. After learning the situation, County Magistrate Chen ordered Deng, the police squad leader, to investigate and verify the matter.</p>
<p>Refugees Pass Through - One False and One True: On the 28th of last month, Zhang Yuehao, who claimed to be a representative of refugees from Xianning County, Jiangxi, arrived in Anting Town, Eighth District, and asked the town's security corps to issue travel expenses, and his desires were very extravagant. The corps asked where the refugees were, and he replied that they were in Gaochang Temple, Shanghai. The district corps leader suspected that he was impersonating and planned to punish him according to the county order. Zhang saw that he had been exposed and escaped. Yesterday (1st), more than 370 refugees from Xinhua, Hunan, entered the country from Taicang and requested accommodation for one night. The corps agreed and directed them to Bodhi Temple as a place to stay. The next day, they gave them travel expenses and escorted them out of the country in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<p>Regarding the matter of your esteemed newspaper carrying a report today stating that on the morning of the 1st, four automobiles came from Shanghai to Zhuanqiao, carrying about thirty bandits with twenty Mauser pistols, intending to loot. The report further stated that the defense corps went to suppress them and seized four Mauser pistols. After reading this, we were extremely surprised. Zhuanqiao is under the jurisdiction of the First Police Station of our Bureau's Second Branch. The station also has assigned police officers. This morning, we received a report from Li Weimin, an officer of the Second Branch, stating that more than thirty soldiers and police officers dispatched by the Songjiang Joint Defense Command arrived at the bridge at various times in the afternoon, claiming to be under orders to intercept deserters. They requested the assistance of the police officers stationed at the station and jointly inspected passing automobiles and pedestrians. They found nothing until evening, and the soldiers and police officers returned to Songjiang. There was no discovery of bandits or seizure of Mauser pistols. Today, our Bureau again sent personnel for a detailed investigation. According to Mr. Ma, a staff member of Zhuanqiao Station, and the head of the police station, no bandits were found yesterday, and no Mauser pistols were seized. As this matter concerns local security, we are making a factual statement and request that it be corrected in the newspaper. Shanghai County Public Security Bureau. September 2nd.</p>

<p>(Osaka Correspondence) Chinese have resided in Osaka for more than eighty years, with a population reaching over five thousand. All children of overseas Chinese have been studying in Japanese schools because there is no overseas Chinese elementary school. Consequently, they receive foreign education and hardly know themselves as Chinese. They speak Japanese and their behavior tends towards Japanese. This certainly poses the danger of national assimilation. Several years ago, prominent overseas Chinese in Osaka suggested establishing a Chinese school, but due to improper management, it was repeatedly started and stopped. Currently, Li Ziyu and Chai Zijing, hired from Tsinghua University in Peiping, are responsible for preparatory matters. All procedures have been properly arranged, the school has been registered with the Ministry of Education, and permission has been obtained from the Japanese authorities. Regarding funding, the Beibang Guild will provide an annual subsidy of 4,000 Japanese yen. Tuition will be waived for students. The school will be divided into higher and lower elementary levels and is scheduled to open on September 1st.</p>

<p>The Department of Education Oversees Enrollment for Provincial High Schools: The Anhui Department of Education, because the principals of provincial high schools had not yet been announced but enrollment was urgent, specially appointed Supervisor Wang Dexi to oversee high schools and Wei Congxu, director of elementary school management, to oversee enrollment for high schools and affiliated elementary schools. Section chiefs Li Zhongxiang, Zhang Xinpei, and Chen Xifang, supervisors Wu Liangfu, Wang Dexi, and Ye Minghui, and translation director Pan Chuji were appointed to organize an examination committee to set questions and supervise the exams. Apart from the affiliated elementary school's new student exams, which were held on the 21st of this month, the high school new student exams were completed on the 25th and 26th, with oral exams held on the 27th. Security was tight and extremely serious. Once the scores of each subject's exam papers have been graded, the results will be announced.</p>
<p>Provincial Popular Education Center Renamed Public Education Center: The Department of Education, based on the Improvement Plan for Social Education resolved at the Second National Education Conference, with the Public Education Center as the implementing agency for social education, and with Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces having already renamed their old Popular Education Centers as Public Education Centers to achieve uniformity, has decided to rename the province's Provincial First, Second, and Third Popular Education Centers as the First, Second, and Third Public Education Centers.</p>
<p>Cessation of Funding for Luyang Lakeside Middle School: Private Luyang Lakeside Middle School is poorly managed. Based on the inspection report by former Supervisor Cheng Zongchao in May of the 18th year, the Department of Education found that students' levels were elementary, teachers' teaching methods were inadequate, and after six years of establishment, there was no achievement. The Hefei County Magistrate was ordered to inform the school's board of directors to promptly find a way to rectify the school based on the rural environment. In May of this year, Supervisor Li Guanglie inspected the school again and reported that no one was responsible for school affairs, the administrative organization was unsound, the implementation of discipline was not standardized, the teaching staff was largely unqualified, and the content was extremely corrupt. The Department of Education, considering that the school had not complied with orders, ignored education, and failed to be punished, losing the fundamental purpose of rectifying private schools, specifically, according to Article 8 of the Temporary Regulations on Subsidies for Private Secondary Schools in Anhui Province, has decided to cease the school's subsidy from the 19th year.</p>

<h3 id="e104">First Day of Literacy Campaign in Shanghai County <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The literacy campaign is the foundational work for popularizing education. Literacy is the tool for acquiring knowledge, just as musical notation is for music. Without knowing musical notation, one cannot distinguish the length and pitch of sounds. The inability to popularize education in China stems from this. According to recent statistics, illiteracy accounts for 60% in cities and over 90% in rural areas. On average, over 80% of the national population has not received education. In such a situation, how can our economy and culture compare with those of the world's major powers? Therefore, the Central Government has listed the literacy campaign as the top priority among the seven major movements, which is evident. Although Shanghai County is close to the city, its jurisdiction is mostly rural, with numerous farmers, so the literacy campaign is particularly important. Currently, the County Party Headquarters, together with the County Government, will hold large-scale literacy campaign promotion meetings in various districts starting from September 1st. Yesterday was the first day, and representatives from the two agencies, carrying slogans, leaflets, and booklets, went to the First District (i.e., Minhang), where a meeting was held at the public sports ground. Groups from agriculture, commerce, and education attended. District Chief Wu Jingqing presided. After the formalities, the meeting commenced. First, the chairman reported, followed by speeches from Fu Dianying, representative of the County Government, Jiang Yanqiu, representative of the County Party Headquarters, and Jin Zuobin from the Public Education Center. The meeting adjourned around 3:00 PM, and a parade was held around the area.</p>

<p>Initially, my intention was to temporarily manage for ten days, but due to the San Teh Tang case, I came to the bureau twice and have now been in charge for exactly one month. During this period, Mr. Tsai discussed matters with the heads of various departments but did not have a face-to-face meeting with all the bureau's staff. Now that the new appointment has been decided and the handover is imminent, he gathered all the staff for a farewell speech at noon one day. Mr. Tsai's speech was divided into three parts: (1) He explained the course of his temporary assignment, from ten days to one month. (2) He expressed his gratitude for the dedication and support of all the staff during this month. (3) He stated that military transportation was very important during this month. After his arrival, he did not cause any delays in military transportation and also took care of business operations, ensuring that no ships were idle and maintaining the regular schedules of various routes. Regarding business operations, the internal coordination of Section Chief Shen Chung-yi and the external efforts and guidance of Deputy Section Chief Li Yun-liang were particularly effective. He deeply relied on their assistance in managing the overall situation.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Mr. Li to Assume Office Immediately. Mr. Tsai Told the Reporter, <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>I have already met with Deputy Minister Li. Now Li has entered Beijing, probably to discuss various reorganization matters with Minister Wang. General Manager Li is expected to arrive in Shanghai this Thursday (i.e., the 4th) to assume office, or he may arrive at the bureau. Even if there is a slight delay in Beijing, he can decide to assume office by the 5th at the latest. I (Mr. Tsai refers to himself) will immediately hand over duties and go to Beijing after Deputy Minister Li arrives at the bureau. I will not stay in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Raising Back Pay for Staff. The Bureau Is Riddled with Problems. <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The most difficult issue is finance. Mr. Tsai's term coincided with internal and external communication challenges. The salaries of the bureau's employees have been in arrears for two months. Considering the difficulties faced by the staff, Mr. Tsai has raised a sum of money. He has already notified the staff yesterday that, no matter what, he will manage to issue one month's salary to provide for their livelihood before he leaves office. According to Mr. Tsai's statement to the reporter yesterday, the payment should be made today or tomorrow. Mr. Tsai has stated that he will not accept his own salary of one thousand yuan for serving as acting general manager for this month. He is willing to fulfill his obligations and only accept reimbursement for travel expenses to and from Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Progress on Wharf Negotiations. The Kin Li Yuen Wharf Negotiations <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>are the most important matter during Mr. Tsai's term. Since the bureau sent Kao Shuo to negotiate with the San Teh Tang's arbitrators, the French side has created numerous obstacles, preventing the matter from being resolved quickly. Yesterday, Mr. Tsai told the reporter that our arbitrators recently discussed the matter with the San Teh Tang's representatives, and there has been new progress on the whole. The San Teh Tang has agreed to continue leasing the Kin Li Yuen wharf to the bureau for management, but it still insists on taking back the Kin Li Yuen's warehouse and has indicated that it will not lease it out again. Because the wharf is no longer a problem, our side is now raising new issues regarding the warehouse. Since they do not want to lease it, we propose to buy the warehouse to prevent the excellent warehouse from being damaged. This is currently in progress. In general, the purchase of the warehouse needs to be vigorously pursued after the new General Manager takes over, to achieve the goal of having the wharves and warehouses managed by the bureau. Another piece of news is that Father Hsia Hsi of the French San Teh Tang is currently seeking instructions from the Paris General Cathedral, and has not yet received a reply, so the negotiations have temporarily stopped.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Bureau Staff Resignations. After the Death of Chao Tieh-chiao, Hung <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Yen-pin resigned as head of the Accounting Department, and Wang Tzu-chien also resigned as head of the General Affairs Department. Because Mr. Tsai did not bring anyone to the bureau, he temporarily appointed bureau staff to act as heads. In addition, Lung Hsia-chu, head of the Shipping Department, also tendered his resignation. Mr. Tsai tried to persuade him to stay, but to no avail, so he appointed Shen Chi-yun, a staff member of the Shipping Section, as temporary head. The vacant positions of the department heads will be filled after the new appointee arrives.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Recent Status of River and Sea Merchant Ships. Six Yangtze River ships had already <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>resumed their regular schedules, but now they have suspended service again due to an incident. It was learned yesterday that the upper reaches vessel, the Omei, has been released and will be put back into service after repairs. The Chiang Ching, which was damaged by collisions with the Ta Ta and Ta Chi, will soon be repaired and resume service. One ship each remains in service on the northern and southern oceans.</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Remittance of Indemnities and Loans for August Has Been Made. <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Greatly Valued by Foreign Newspapers.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that, with the slight recovery in silver prices last week, the Customs saved no less than 100,000 taels on the foreign payments due in August. As the end of the month fell on a Sunday, all indemnity payments and domestic and foreign debt payments were made by the Finance Department on August 30, totaling 3,870,237.29 taels. At a time when world trade is sluggish and all countries are affected, China's customs revenue can fulfill all guaranteed domestic and foreign debts with a surplus, which is quite noteworthy.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Ke Ching-en Passed Through Shanghai Yesterday on His Way Back to Hangzhou <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>to Visit His Mother.</p>
<p>Ke Ching-en, the mayor of Qingdao, along with his wife, sons and daughters (five in total), and three servants, traveled south from Qingdao on the Japanese ship "Tientsin Maru" on the morning of the 1st. They arrived in Shanghai at around 3 PM yesterday. The ship docked at the Huangpu Wharf. Also arriving were Lu Chuan, the Director of the Finance Bureau, and Cheng Chao-ching, the Director of the Port Affairs Bureau. Those who came to welcome them included Xu Hsiao-chai, the captain of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Water Patrol Team, and several detectives, who were there to provide assistance. According to Mr. Ke, the new mayor, Hu Hsin, was traveling to Qingdao on the Zhenhai warship. When the Tientsin Maru left Qingdao at 8 AM, the warship had not yet arrived, so they did not meet. Because his mother is ill and he needs to return to Hangzhou to visit her, and also because he is feeling slightly unwell, he did not linger in Shanghai and took the Shanghai-Hangzhou express train back to Hangzhou at around 5 PM. The date of his trip to Beijing has not yet been decided, but he will have to go to Beijing eventually. At that time, Mr. Ke was taking care of the luggage and sending people to buy Shanghai-Hangzhou train tickets, and seemed quite hurried.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Literacy Campaign in the First District of Shanghai County Yesterday. <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>

After performing the ceremony, the chairman, Wu Ching-ching, gave a report, followed by speeches from Chiang Wen-pao, the representative of the County Party Department, and Fu Tien-ying, the representative of the County Government. Finally, Chin Tso-pin, the director of the People's Education Center, gave a speech. After the meeting, there was a parade throughout the town to spread the word. At 7 PM, the County People's Education Center invited the Central Primary School, the Rural Normal School, and the Guang Chi Home for Children to participate in various performances. The center also performed a self-written play called "Awakening," which vividly portrayed the suffering caused by illiteracy. About 500 people watched the performance that evening and were moved by it.</p>

<p>The newly appointed Director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, Sung Shu-chiao, tendered his resignation to Minister Wang immediately after the announcement. He has now been approved by an official order, and the former Director, Chen Hsi-tseng, will return to his original position.</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Turkish Minister Paid a Visit to Wang Chia-chen Yesterday. <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Fud Bey, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Turkish Embassy in China, telegraphed Mr. Liu Yun-fang, the Director of the Foreign Affairs Office, yesterday morning to schedule a meeting with Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Chia-chen. Mr. Liu arranged the meeting, and the Turkish Minister drove to Mr. Wang's residence on Rue Massenet at 2 PM yesterday. Mr. Liu escorted him into the reception hall and introduced him to Vice Minister Wang. They had a pleasant conversation for a long time. Mr. Fud invited Mr. Wang to a dinner at a later date. Mr. Wang declined, saying that he had to return to Beijing today and would set a date for a return visit when he comes to Shanghai next time.</p>

<p>Wang I-chun, the Director of the Education Bureau of Hankou and the Director of the Organization Department of the City, came to Shanghai on official business a few days ago. He has now completed his work and took the night train to Beijing last night. After a short stay, he will fly back to Hankou.</p>
<h3 id="e131">The Order Lifting the Ban on Flour Exports Has Not Arrived. <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Flour Mills Reduce Working Hours.</p>
<p>Although there is talk of lifting the ban on the export of flour to the north, the Customs has not yet received an official document from the Ministry of Finance for several days. Therefore, the export of flour to Tianjin is still subject to the ban, which has had a significant impact on the flour merchants in the port, due to sluggish sales. It was reported that some flour mills have reduced their working hours, starting the day before yesterday, by about 40% compared to normal, in order to avoid stockpiling. On the other hand, they are still making every effort to urge the National Government to lift the ban as soon as possible to alleviate the merchants' difficulties, but it is not known whether they will be able to obtain approval.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Special News from the Yangtze River Shipping Area. <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>British Naval Escorts for Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire Ships on the Yangtze River. Recently, due to frequent attacks in the Wuxue area of the upper Yangtze River, the various ships have requested the British military in Hankou to dispatch a platoon of soldiers to be stationed on the ships for the safety of passengers and cargo, starting from September 1st. Iron plates have also been placed outside the driver's room to benefit passengers and cargo.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Many People from Hunan Arrive in Shanghai. <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>In Recent Days, a Large Number of People from Southern Hunan and Changsha have Traveled by Ship to Hankou or Transferred to Ships to Shanghai. Over the past two days, the ships sailing downstream on the Yangtze River to Shanghai have been crowded with passengers, with no space left. Most of them came from Hunan to Shanghai, bringing their old and young, in a very miserable state.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Aftermath of the Three Ships' Encounter with Danger. The Nisshin Steamship Co.'s "Taikichi Maru," the Butterfield &amp; Swire Yangtze River Ship, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Co.'s "Chien Kuo" and Two Other Ships <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>

<h3 id="e135">Shanghai-Hankou Remittances Are Being Collected and Remitted as Usual. <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Weavers Association stated that many of its members trade with merchants from Changsha. Since the central army recovered Changsha, the overall situation in the city has been stable. However, the merchants from Changsha stationed in Shanghai to purchase goods still have some excuses regarding the remittance of funds. As the end of the eighth month approaches and financial turnover is crucial, the association was planning to write to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to inquire with the Changsha Chamber of Commerce. However, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter yesterday stating that it had received an urgent telegram from the Changsha Chamber of Commerce stating that, due to rumors in the provincial capital, financial activities had been temporarily suspended. However, the market is now peaceful as usual, and Shanghai-Hankou remittances are being collected and remitted as usual. They hope that this information will be passed on to the various merchant guilds. Accordingly, they have recorded the telegram and notified them for their information. It is reported that the association has sent letters to its members to inform them.</p>
<h3 id="e136">An Appeal Regarding the Disaster in Yunmeng Caused by the Communists. <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Hubei Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation Asks for Funds for Relief.</p>
<p>The Hubei Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation telegraphed that it had received an urgent telegram from the entire executive and supervisory committee of the Yunmeng County Chamber of Commerce, leading hundreds of refugees, stating that on the morning of the 6th of this month, thousands of communists suddenly occupied the city, killing, looting, and ravaging it. They only left by their original route at 2 PM on the 9th, after seeing planes dropping bombs. The period of occupation lasted four days, and the disasters that occurred were too horrible to describe. On the second day, they forced the merchants and residents to pay 70,000 yuan. After the money was paid on the following day, they ransacked the cloth merchants, causing a total loss of over 40,000 bolts of white cloth and over ten bales of foreign yarn. About ten large and small grocery stores, about ten large and small piece goods stores, and about ten herbal medicine stores were all looted. The number of small merchants and residents engaged in flower, grain, handicraft, and cooked food businesses who were displaced is countless. In addition, over twenty hostages were taken from the white cloth, piece goods, and grocery businesses, and over thirty residents were asked to pay ransom ranging from one thousand to ten thousand yuan. So far, no one has been able to redeem them. Furthermore, the bandits brutally killed six people when they left, and the rest has not yet been verified. In total, the losses of merchants and residents account for more than half of their assets. Since the county was established hundreds of years ago, there has never been such a catastrophe. The successive county magistrates have been collecting gun money from the merchants, amounting to thousands of yuan, but they have not seen a single new gun purchased. In times of crisis, they only run away with their guns, leaving ten out of ten homes empty, with wives crying and children weeping, staging this tragic scene. The association has convened a joint meeting of refugees and merchants, and resolved that, in addition to the association organizing a fundraising group to freely solicit donations from major cities and philanthropists for relief, they are telegraphing to express their hot zeal for relief, and to quickly forward the telegram to the Hubei Provincial Government and the Hubei Department of Civil Affairs, pleading for compassion.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Give subsidies for disaster relief, to help the urgent needs. Considering that the county is small and the people are economical, they suddenly encountered a major change. The appeal could not be delayed. The situation is truly pitiful. In accordance with the previous telegram, we respectfully request people in Shanghai or Hubei merchants to make donations to help the surviving people after the catastrophe. We will be eternally grateful. [Signed] Su Tai-yu, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Negotiations on the "New Canton" Ship Case. <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>It is Necessary to Ensure That the Case Is Handled and Investigated.</p>
<p>In the case of the "New Canton" ship being sunk by the Japanese ship "Tatsuno Maru," the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai Provisional Court in accordance with the International Maritime Law. However, the Shanghai branch of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha stated that the "Tatsuno Maru" was not at fault in the collision, and if the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had any demands on the company, it should file a lawsuit in the Japanese court in accordance with formal litigation procedures. The Ministry of Communications believes that the Japanese side is not acknowledging responsibility, so it has sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, asking it to promptly notify the Japanese side to handle the case so that it can be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Recent News on the Port Affairs Bureau's Purchase of the Ta Ta Wharf. <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>A Solution Is Expected Soon.</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Port Affairs Bureau began negotiating with the various shipping companies for the purchase of the Ta Ta Wharf at the 16th Pier in the South City, the bureau has prepared funds to buy back the wharves of companies such as the Min Hsing, which have already returned to the bureau's ownership. However, the Ta Ta Wharf has not yet been resolved because the purchase price is higher than that of other wharves, amounting to 100,000 yuan. Before Mayor Chang left Shanghai, he promised that the municipal government would provide cash to purchase the wharf. Later, when the mayor left Shanghai due to an incident, the municipal government agreed to pay 20,000 yuan per year for five years. Upon hearing this, the company had no intention of temporarily transferring ownership. It is now heard that there is a solution being discussed, with the result being 60% cash and 40% municipal bonds. If so, a formal resolution is expected soon.</p>
<h3 id="e139">News on the Organization of the International Lawyers Association. <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Lawyers Association of the Republic of China has initiated the expansion of the International Lawyers Association to promote the spirit of Chinese legislation and to unify the legislative principles of individualistic and communistic countries with the legislative principles of the Three Principles of the People. The association had previously sent letters to Chinese ambassadors and consuls abroad, asking them to forward the telegrams to the lawyers' associations in their respective countries to solicit their consent. The association has recently received several letters from the Chinese Embassy in Sweden and the consulates in Penang, etc., all stating that they admire the association's efforts to improve the legal system for the purpose of a better life for mankind. In addition to forwarding the entrusted items to a certain lawyers' association, they have also attached the name and address of the association for reference. It is learned that Mr. Fukushima, a Japanese national, had previously lobbied in Europe and the United States for this purpose but was unsuccessful. Now that Chinese ambassadors and consuls abroad are happily supporting the National Lawyers Association's continued organizational efforts, it should be able to achieve its goal and open a new era of rule of law for the world.</p>
<h3 id="e140">The Red Cross' Committee to Amend the Articles of Association. <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Fourth Meeting.</p>
<p>The Committee to Amend the Articles of Association of the Chinese Red Cross held its fourth meeting at 2 PM on September 1st. The attendees included Li Chen-pang, Hung Yen-pin, Yeh Chih-sheng, Wang Pei-yuan, Liu Hong-sheng, Hsu Hsi-chun, Hsueh Shao-ting, Yang Ke, Chiang Ta-chiu, and Wu Chia-san. Chairman Wen Lan-ting was on leave, so Wang Pei-yuan served as chairman. After performing the ceremony and reading the minutes of the previous meeting, which were approved without any objections, the chairman signed them. (1) The chairman read the reply from the Standing Committee, entrusting the committee to draft the rules of procedure for the election of standing members and various supplementary rules, and asked for a public decision. It was decided that the committee would draft the rules and inform the Standing Committee. (2) The chairman proposed that, having agreed to draft the rules for the Standing Committee, drafters should be appointed. Hung Yen-pin was elected as the drafter for the Standing Member Election Law, and Yeh Chih-sheng was elected as the drafter for the Rules of Procedure. (3) Yeh Chih-sheng proposed that the Articles of Association of the Chinese Red Cross be submitted for a second reading, which was approved. The articles were then discussed one by one. Yeh Chih-sheng stated that Article 1, "The association is a legal corporation in law," should be changed to "an international charitable organization." Hung Yen-pin stated that in Article 2, the word "佛" (Buddha) in the "日內瓦佛條約" (Geneva Buddha Treaty) should be changed to "弗" (not) according to its transliteration and that English name should be added in parentheses. He also stated that Article 4 should be moved to the last article of the articles of association. Hsueh Shao-ting stated that the "棺柩所" (coffin place) in Article 7 should be changed to "施材所" (material distribution place). Hung Yen-pin stated that the phrase "以上列各機關之規則另定之" (The rules for the above-mentioned agencies shall be determined separately) in Article 1 can be deleted and moved to the end of Article 7. Wang Pei-yuan stated that the phrase "器械藥品綳帶等" (instruments, medicines, bandages, etc.) in Article 9, paragraph 1, was unclear. Hung Yen-pin stated that this article should be changed to "藥品綳帶等治療用之器械及消耗品" (medicines, bandages, and other instruments and consumables for treatment). Chiang Ta-chiu stated that Chapter 3, "Organization," and Chapter 4, "Affairs," should be changed to Chapter 3, "Affairs," and Chapter 4, "Organization," in accordance with the old articles of association. Yang Ke seconded. Yeh Chih-sheng stated that Articles 14, 15, and 16 in Chapter 3 should be moved after Article 61 in Chapter 9, and Article 17 should be moved after Article 46 in Chapter 5. Hung Yen-pin stated that "代表大會" (Congress of Representatives) should be changed to "會員大會" (General Meeting of Members). Also, the phrase "主席辦理會務、代表本會監督、及任免所有職員" (The chairman shall handle the affairs of the association, represent the association in supervision, and appoint and remove all staff) in Article 31 should be changed to "主席辦理會務、代表本會及監督與任免所有職員" (The chairman shall handle the affairs of the association, represent the association and supervise, and appoint and remove all staff). Wang Pei-yuan stated that in Chapter 5, "Property," a clause should be added stating that "all assets of the association shall be reported to the National Government for record-keeping, and all assets of the branches shall be reported to the general association for record-keeping by the general association." Hung Yen-pin stated that the phrase "大會之主席、由常議會議長充之" (The chairman of the congress shall be the chairman of the standing committee) in Article 38 is too limited in number. Yeh Chih-sheng seconded, and it was changed to "大會之主席、由常議會正副議長及執行委員會正副主席充之" (The chairman of the congress shall be the chairman and vice-chairman of the standing committee and the chairman and vice-chairman of the executive committee). Chiang Ta-chiu stated that Article 59 should be moved after Article 30. Yang Ke stated that Chapter 9, "Rewards and Punishments," should be divided into two chapters, and the word "punishments" is also inappropriate and should be changed to Chapter 9, "Rewards," and Chapter 10, "Discipline." Yeh Chih-sheng stated that the original word "三" (three) in Chapter 10 should be deleted. Chiang Ta-chiu stated that the change of "Congress of Representatives" to "General Meeting of Members" and Article 62 still need to be studied. The chairman stated that they will be discussed again during the third reading. The meeting adjourned after 5 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e141">The Kiangsu and Chekiang Silk Weaving Associations Petition for Amendment of the Factory Law. <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Kiangsu and Chekiang Silk Weaving Associations telegraphed Minister Kung of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Labor of the National Government in the capital again, requesting an amendment to the Factory Law. The original telegram stated that, after receiving the ministry's approval number 1494, it was submitted to a joint conference of the two provinces for discussion. Everyone believed that China's production is backward, and its industry is still in its infancy. Most factories are small-scale operations, barely enough to make a living, and do not have the financial resources for such large-scale equipment. It is the general opinion of the association that the complete and perfect nature of this law is beneficial to industry and commerce, but it does not apply to China's factories in their current state. The delegates of the silk industry of Kiangsu and Chekiang provinces, at an extraordinary joint meeting, have decided to re-petition for an amendment to Article 1 of the Factory Law, which states that "this law applies to factories that use steam, electricity, or water power to operate machinery and regularly employ 'thirty or more' workers." It should be amended to "(... three thousand...)". They should therefore telegraph to clear the ears and to respectfully ask the ministry to verify and approve the petition to the Executive Yuan to consult the Legislative Yuan to amend the law in order to protect industry and maintain commerce, and must not be in a panic and specially ordered to arrive.</p>
<h3 id="e142">The Yung An Cotton Mill Rice Subsidy Dispute Resolved. <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Union's Request for Rice Subsidies Rejected.</p>
<p>Maintaining the Mill's Fair Price Policy.</p>
<p>The Yung An Textile Factory No. 2 Union requested a rice subsidy, which resulted in a dispute. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs convened a mediation meeting, but no agreement was reached. The labor side then submitted a petition to the Municipal Government for arbitration. It is now heard that the labor-management arbitration committee of the municipal government has ruled on the matter, with the main points being: (1) The union's request for a rice subsidy should be rejected. (2) The mill's fair price policy should be maintained. This policy shall be suspended only when the price of rice falls below 13 yuan. The full text of the reasoning is as follows: "The price of rice in this city has been high for several months. The Yung An Textile Factory No. 2 Union believes that the wages of the workers are meager and their livelihood is difficult. They requested that the capital side provide a rice subsidy. The mediation committee held a meeting, but the capital side insisted that there was no precedent for rice subsidies in Chinese cotton mills and could not agree. As a result, the mediation failed. The committee then convened an arbitration meeting. The representatives of the capital side submitted a statement, still claiming that they were experiencing business difficulties and could not afford to grant the union's request for a rice subsidy. The statement went on to say that in 1926, due to high rice prices, the mill adopted a policy of selling rice at a fair price in the factory, and this has been implemented again, with a sales point set up, and this has been in operation for almost a month to provide assistance. The committee then inquired in detail about the mill's fair price policy. According to the representatives of the capital side, the mill's fair price policy was decided by the board of directors and started on August 1st. The purchase price of the white rice was 18 yuan per picul, and the fair price was 13 yuan per picul. Workers who have worked in the factory for four days or more will receive a fair price rice coupon for one yuan each. Workers who have worked in the factory for nine days or more will receive two fair price rice coupons. Workers who work in the factory can buy four yuan worth of fair-priced rice per month. The mill sells an average of 50 piculs of fair-priced rice per day, which means that the mill must lose 7,500 yuan per month at the current market price." The representatives of the labor side were then asked for their opinion on the mill's fair price policy. They replied that the fair price policy implemented by the mill was not very convenient for workers who eat out, and the benefits for the workers were not universal. They still requested a rice subsidy. The committee reviewed the fact that the workers' request for a rice subsidy due to the high price of rice was legitimate, but the mill had already voluntarily implemented a fair price policy, which had already provided a solution for the impact of high rice prices on the workers. The rice subsidy problem had already been solved. Furthermore, after investigating the mill's fair price policy, it was found that the workers were indeed receiving real benefits, and the amount of the subsidy was also larger than that of other cotton mills run by Chinese merchants that provide rice subsidies. This shows that the mill is not indifferent to the workers' livelihood. The representatives of the labor side still insisted on issuing a rice subsidy on the grounds that it was inconvenient for workers who eat out to buy fair-priced rice, but the reason was insufficient and should be rejected. Although the representatives of the capital side stated to the committee that there was no limit to the period of the fair price policy and that they intended to suspend it only when the price of rice fell below 13 yuan, this should also be clearly stipulated to allow the workers to work with peace of mind. The committee decided to make a ruling as stated in the main points.</p>

<h3 id="e144">The Wage Increase for Stevedores at the Butterfield &amp; Swire Wharf Resolved. <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The stevedores on the Butterfield &amp; Swire Company's wharf in Pudong requested a wage increase from the contractor, Chang Shunlianxin, due to the high cost of goods and the difficulty of living. This request was not met, resulting in a strike on the 25th of last month. The Bureau of Social Affairs mediated the dispute several times, but no resolution was reached. It is now learned that the bureau invited representatives from both sides to negotiate again the day before yesterday. The attitudes of the labor and capital sides were more moderate than before. As a result, the capital side agreed to increase the workers' daily wage by 120 cash, and to increase the night shift by 70 cash if there is no night meal. The capital side will also be responsible for collecting union dues on behalf of the union.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance instructed the Jiangsu Financial Commissioner's Office, stating, "For compliance, the Shanghai Coal Industry Association has submitted a telegram stating that coal tax is being forcibly collected with bond subscriptions, and non-standard receipts are being issued, requesting a cancellation order, etc. Upon investigation, this case was previously submitted, approved, and the relevant personnel instructed to comply. Now, based on previous information, except for the acknowledgment of the telegram, the bond subscription related to tax is proportional to the commodity tax, originally an equal method. How can the claim of distinction between poor and wealthy merchants be made? It is entirely incorrect. At this critical juncture of military progress, financial needs are extremely pressing, and bond subscription is of utmost urgency. The association is hereby tasked with earnestly guiding the fellow merchants, avoiding further excuses and evasion, which would resemble disrupting the bond drive, leading to unfavorable consequences. Regarding receipts, the Jiangsu Financial Commissioner has been strictly ordered again to instruct the Coal Tax Bureau to uniformly issue official printed receipts. In addition to the approval, it is hereby further ordered that the said personnel be instructed to comply accordingly. This order is hereby issued."</p>

Two years ago, they eloped without a trace. Shi searched everywhere for information, but found nothing until now. Shi, working in Shanghai, finally discovered that his wife and Liu were living together as husband and wife in Caonitang, Yangjiadu, Pudong. Burning with jealousy, he angrily went to catch them in the act. He apprehended the "wild ducks" together and took them to the First Precinct of the Third District. Yesterday, they were sent to the local court for trial.</p>

<p>Fu Ruiqing, a police officer from the Second Precinct of the Fourth District of Zhabei, was previously suspected of luring away Dou Heqi, a female worker at the Xiesheng Silk Factory, and was sent to the Public Security Bureau for questioning.

<p>Yesterday at half past noon, a blind youth was found attempting suicide by hanging himself from a telephone pole near Pengjiazhai, Lannidu, Pudong. Fortunately, Li Dianming, a patrol officer from the Third District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was passing by and rescued him, saving his life. He was taken to the district for questioning. The youth stated his name was Wang Shunxing, 24 years old, from Gaoyou. He used to farm in his hometown, but was conscripted into the army and sent to Fujian. Later, due to physical weakness and blindness, he was released and sent back. Passing through Shanghai, he had no relatives or friends, and no money, facing starvation. Therefore, he resorted to suicide, etc. The district chief, considering his plight as a wanderer in a foreign land attempting suicide, found his situation particularly pitiable and ordered that a report be prepared and sent to the General Bureau for relief.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Silk Pongee Gown Recognized at Police Station <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Confirmed as Stolen Property</p>
<p>Leading to the Arrest of a Thief</p>
<p>At 8:40 a.m. on the morning before yesterday, the home of Cheng Baishun, a local resident at No. 493-494 Fu'an Lane, North Zhejiang Road, was invaded by four thugs. Each held a handgun and first confined the family members to one room, forbidding them from making any noise. Then, they ransacked the boxes and chests, stealing seven yuan in cash, a gold watch, several pieces of clothing, and fled with the loot. At that time, detectives Liu Changgen and Ding Baoxiang from the Huisi Police Station, along with Chinese and foreign officers, were inspecting passing pedestrians and vehicles on North Shanxi Road. They saw a man wearing a light blue silk pongee gown who looked suspicious and searched him. A handgun with six live rounds was found on his person, and he was taken back to the police station. Coincidentally, Cheng Baishun was also reporting his home invasion to the police station. He inadvertently caught sight of the silk pongee gown and recognized it as stolen property. He then learned that the man was one of the four thieves. Upon questioning by the police chief, the man confessed his name was Qiang Yongxiang, a native of Wuxi. Yesterday, he was sent to the Special District Local Court for prosecution. Cheng's nephew, Xi Rong, also testified in court, confirming that the defendant was indeed the thief holding the gun at the scene. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the police station still needed to investigate and requested an extension. Judge Sun briefly questioned the defendant and ordered him to be detained, rescheduling the hearing for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Dispute Over Leased Land in Yu Garden <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Police Station No Longer Intervening</p>
<p>The Guihua Hall and neighboring Ji Shunxing Bird Shop and other houses and open space in the Yu Garden of the City God Temple belong to the Qingfen Tang of the old Flower Industry Association and are managed by Director Zhang Yuanmao. Since the fire in Guihua Hall, Zhang Yuanmao originally intended to rebuild it, but was opposed by other directors, resulting in years of litigation and no construction. Furthermore, because the adjacent houses and open space were leased to Ji Shunxing Bird Shop, etc., with fixed-term contracts, which have not yet expired, Jiang Heting (also known as Jiang Zhongyi) reported to the Second Precinct of the First District last month, deceptively requesting the police to order tenants such as Yu Guangyin and Ji Shunxing to move out immediately to facilitate renovation. As the shops stated that their lease contracts had not expired, they refused to move. Officer Ma summoned the staff of Ji Shunxing shop, ordering them to provide a guarantee and vacate the premises within seven days, or face consequences. Subsequently, Ji Hailan, the owner of the birdcage shop, Yu Guangyin, and various stallholders jointly sued the local court, stating that they had leased the houses and open space from the Qingfen Tang Association, all with leases that should be contractually binding. Jiang Heting has no relationship with the property, so how could he request the police station to order them to move out for renovation, etc.? The court held a joint hearing on the 28th of last month, but the defendant Jiang Heting did not appear, and the case was not concluded. Unexpectedly, the Second Precinct of the First District again instructed the police to summon Yu Guangyin and the various stallholders to the police station the day before yesterday (the 1st), asking why they refused to move. Yu Guangyin, etc., replied that they had already sued in the local court and that Jiang Heting had not appeared at the hearing despite having sufficient reasons, and was now deceptively seeking an order to move from the police station. But this is a civil lawsuit and should be adjudicated by the judicial authorities. Yu Guangyin, etc., accompanied the police to the station to explain the situation, and asked Officer Ma to hand Jiang Heting over to them to go to the local court for questioning, and presented a draft subpoena. Officer Ma, observing that the case was already in court, decided to wait for a verdict before handling it further, and allowed Yu Guangyin, etc., to leave.</p>

<p>Pirates Searched Ship by Ship</p>
<p>Passenger's Lost Money Recovered</p>
<p>The Xin Qingying small steamer, a Pinghu-bound vessel of the Qingji Inland River Shipping Company at Beisuzhou Road, Pentang Lane Bridge North, was towing a company ship filled with passengers and cargo the day before yesterday (the 1st). It departed from Shanghai at around 4:00 PM and sailed to Niutengjian, east of Siputang. At around 10:00 PM, four pirate ships suddenly appeared, carrying more than twenty pirates. They shouted for the steamer to stop and fired four volleys of gunfire. The steamer's captain, Yang Xingdi, had no choice but to stop the engine. The pirates jumped onto the steamer and began searching. They stole 150 yuan in cash, two leather suitcases, four bundles of clothing, more than twenty quilts, silk, satin, foreign cloth, cigarettes, satin shoes, and fruits such as bananas from Yang Xingdi, worth seven or eight hundred yuan in total. After robbing the steamer, they boarded the company ship (Captain Qin A'gen) and stole 50 pounds of wool, 10 bottles of brandy, and a large leather suitcase (belonging to Zhu Xiangrui, being transported to Haiyan), and sailed away with the loot after firing a shot. The steamer was carrying two passengers, including a Mr. Yang from Haiyan who was doing business in Shanghai. His relative in his hometown had recently died of illness and was destitute. He received a urgent letter informing him that his relatives had passed but left nothing for a coffin and burial. Mr. Yang immediately raised 51 yuan in Shanghai to return home on the steamer to purchase a coffin and bury the relative. When he saw the pirates boarding the ship, he threw a packet of money in the cabin. It was later found by a ship worker, Mr. Jia. After the theft, Mr. Yang told the crowd about his situation, weeping. Mr. Jia inquired about the amount and the name of the bank, which matched. He took out the packet of money and returned it. Mr. Yang was overjoyed and took out five yuan to give to Mr. Jia as a reward, thanking him profusely. It was indeed fortunate. After the steamer was robbed, it continued to Pinghu. In addition to the ship's accountant, Ding Meijiang, reporting the incident to the local water police, the steamer also sailed to Zhujing on the way back and requested the army and police to send officers to investigate. The steamer arrived in Shanghai last night and reported the incident to the company for verification.</p>

<p>Chen Tingfang, a young woman from Nantong, is 19 years old and married to Wang Qingzhang, a simple farmer. She has a son who is only seven months old. The woman is young and weak-willed, leading her to be induced to come to Shanghai by Wang Yiting. Initially, their relationship was very intimate, but once the money ran out, the man lost his face. Wang sold the child to someone for only six yuan, which was quickly spent. He then sold the woman to Lin Yuguang, who resided at No. 15, Lane 85, Jiangbian Wharf, as his wife for an agreed price of 60 yuan, with half paid in advance. Yesterday, Wang went to collect the rest of the money but was grabbed by the woman, who called the police and had him arrested by the Second District Police Station, who then handed him over to the Local Court. After a preliminary hearing by the prosecutor, Wang Yiting was ordered to be detained, while Chen Tingfang was temporarily detained pending notification of her family to claim her.</p>

<p>Yang Chen, the young wife of Yang Guowen, a resident of Caojiadu in West Shanghai, had an affair with Gong Yonglin. The day before yesterday, she packed her clothes and hid in Gong's home in Sijiantou. However, Yang had already found out and had people lying in wait to arrest her. Yang Chen needed to change her clothes but could not retrieve them, so she asked Zhu Hongxiang, a male worker at the factory, to retrieve them for her. Zhu, who was only fifteen years old and unaware of the situation, happily went and was captured by Yang and others, who took him to the Police Station of the 86th district. Zhu explained the situation, and a senior police officer was immediately sent to the factory to arrest Yang Chen and take her to the police station. After clarifying the situation, she was ordered to be handed over to the Local Court for handling.</p>

<p>French Concession police detectives discovered the day before yesterday that Wang Yanji, a resident, was illegally operating an opium den, allowing members of the lower classes to smoke opium pills. This not only violated the ban but also endangered people's lives. They raided the premises and seized the opium smoking paraphernalia and opium pills, taking them to the police station. Yesterday, they were brought before the French court for prosecution. Wang Yanji confessed that he illegally operated an opium den, and the Chinese and Western judges fined him 75 yuan, confiscated the proceeds, and confiscated the opium smoking paraphernalia and opium pills.</p>

<h3 id="e162">London Women Addicted to Smoking <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Shui</p>
<p>Today's cigarettes are like yesterday's opium. If you stroll through the streets, you will see women, children, and the elderly, almost everyone with a cigarette in their hand. Advocates are worried about this as if it is a dangerous flood. Civilized countries such as England and the United States have contacted three or four confidants to form a tobacco quitting alliance, rejecting tobacco thousands of miles away and treating it as an enemy. The intention is good. However, the law has no provision prohibiting smoking (except for opium). Society also sees smoking as a normal thing, without any moral sanctions. However, when women smoke, society often considers it immoral. Also, there are loud cries to strike it down. Is this gender equality? It is no wonder that London women are addicted to smoking.</p>
<p>Women's Smoking Advertisement: Based on the concept of gender equality, 20th-century London women have reversed their old habits and become addicted to smoking. Recalling decades ago, women's smoking was banned in England and the United States, especially in public places. Today, in London society, such bans are long gone. Whether it is in the home, in the park, on the street, or even in the theater or on public transport, you can often see men and women, young and old, holding cigarettes and shouting wildly without thinking it is strange. However, looking back at the United States, women's smoking is still regarded as a shameful thing. Upper-class women hate it like an enemy. In social situations, if there is a woman present, men must first apologize before smoking. Otherwise, it will be considered rude. American women do not smoke. Years ago, a major American newspaper published an advertisement for cigarettes, depicting a woman smoking. It was met with dissatisfaction from society at the time. Church groups even filed formal protests, forcing it to stop publishing before stopping.</p>
<p>The Queen's Smoking Breaks the Prohibition: The prevalence of cigarettes among London women is as described above. However, there is no one who knows the reason for its prevalence. However, according to those who are deeply familiar with London allusions, there are two major reasons that can be described. One is that the world's cigarette production is increasing day by day. In order to promote their business, a group of ingenious people invented a small cigarette a few years ago, which is specially for women to smoke. The taste is mild and the decoration is beautiful. A few women initially bought and smoked it out of curiosity. Over time, they became addicted. Now it is popular and is considered a habit. The second is that London women smoke. The British Queen is actually a severe ladder. Although London women have been using cigarettes extensively, they often do not dare to do so arbitrarily at royal garden parties. Because there is a queen, how can civilians dare to be so permissive? Unexpectedly, a few years ago, at a banquet hosted by a duke, the Queen also attended. In order to respect the Queen, the hostess had notified the guests in advance not to smoke in their seats. Unexpectedly, halfway through the banquet, the Queen suddenly stood up and looked for cigarettes everywhere. Unable to find any, she ordered her attendants to ask the hostess for them. The hostess was shocked and quickly prepared good cigarettes to give to her. Those guests who had a habit of smoking also took out what they had brought with them and smoked together. For a time, the smoke was thick, and everyone was happy. As a result, the Queen's smoking spread far and wide, and London women felt even less restrained about smoking.</p>

<p>Raw soy sauce is not suitable for consumption. It must be steamed in a rice pot. It is hygienic and not easy to mold.</p>
<p>If you encounter a chimney with fire and smoke, quickly soak salt in water and pour it into a high place, and the smoke and fire will extinguish by themselves.</p>
<p>When buying rice straw at home, be careful of the people who sell straw doing tricks. Generally, the straw that is fraudulent is cheaper than usual, and the form is fluffy and hollow. When weighing the straw, secretly insert the carrying bag into the two loops. Deliberately speaking and pointing to make people look at the head loop and the scale code. Approximately, each bundle of straw is more than twenty pounds, which can be weighed up to fifty pounds. As a result, you will suffer a great loss. If they are seen through, these people will not be willing to sell and leave. This is the secret of the straw sellers, which must be known.</p>

<p>— Liu Hate Me, From Hangzhou</p>
<p>The world is becoming more and more dangerous and cunning. Impersonation and deception are endless. Red figures of the party and the state are often impersonated by people who hold letters and pay visits. Relatives, colleagues, or people who introduce them to seek positions or make loans without permission. If the person in charge is careless, they will fall into their trap. The announcement by He Yingqin can be used as proof. A case of impersonating a letter to seek a position also occurred in Hangzhou a few days ago. It is really unique. There was a Wang Yun, also known as Bingquan, who paid a visit to Zhen Shaoshen, director of the Zhejiang Salt Affairs Anti-Smuggling Bureau. He claimed that he had come from the sea to visit Wen Yingxing, director of the Anti-Smuggling Office of the Ministry of Finance, who had asked him to come. He also presented a letter from Zou Lin, director of the Salt Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, requesting that Wang be appointed as the captain of the anti-smuggling brigade. Director Zhen did not suspect anything at first and regarded it as a normal matter. However, because there was no suitable position at the time, he asked him to wait. Wang then left. A few days later, Director Zhen suddenly received a letter from Director Wen saying that Wang, who had come to seek a position, had replied to Director Zou. He said that Wang Yun had never been known before and had never been recommended. He was impersonating someone to seek advancement. He was afraid that he was not a good person. Please send the original letter back for investigation. On the one hand, please inform him not to give him a position or appointment to avoid trouble. After reading it, Director Zhen understood the situation and ignored it. However, yesterday, Wang came again, claiming that he had been waiting for a position for many days and had not been appointed, so he could not report Director Zou's orders. His words were quite indignant. He also said that if the brigade commander was not available for a while, he could also settle for the captain of the squadron and be promoted later. Director Zhen then asked if he knew Director Zou. Wang said yes. He had known him in Guangzhou and was an old friend of many years. When asked about the origin of the letter, he replied that he had personally asked Director Zou to give it to him in person. Director Zhen could not bear it any longer and smiled. Wang's face changed immediately upon hearing this. He was sternly questioned. He said that he did not know Director Zou well and only knew a secretary of the Salt Affairs Department named Chen Zepai. The letter was forwarded by Chen. Director Zhen carefully examined his tone and found that it was inconsistent. Moreover, most of the secretaries of the Salt Affairs Department were old friends, and there was no one named Chen Zepai. As a result, Wang's crime of impersonating the letter was confirmed, and he was immediately detained. At one time, the guest of honor became a prisoner. Wang was about thirty years old, dressed in a suit, spoke with an Anhui accent, and had a very beautiful appearance. It was said that he had served as the captain of the fourth squadron of the tenth brigade of the Zhejiang Anti-Smuggling Bureau. Later, he was removed for corruption. His actions this time were impersonating someone to seek advancement, and it was inevitable that his nature would be difficult to change. Director Zhen believed that this kind of behavior was not only harmful to Director Zou but also had a great impact on social credit. He planned to send him to court for punishment to warn others.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Azure Rice <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>There are many types of rice. The rice husked from red glutinous rice seeds is red in color like rosy clouds. The rice of white Jingxian rice is as bright as white jade. No matter what type of rice it is, although the colors are different, its function of filling hunger is the same. Rice can relieve hunger, but I have never heard of rice with a color like blue-black. If the color of rice is like blue-black, then the rice will produce black ears. The rice grains that are formed will also become black rice? The strangeness of the matter is something that ordinary people cannot predict. In Shagou Town, Yancheng, farmer Chen has been farming dozens of acres of land. A Hunan friend gave him dozens of pounds of green rice seeds last year. Chen set aside a few acres of land to plant the rice this spring. When the autumn season comes, the rice has matured. The rice ears that are formed in this field are obviously ready to be harvested. However, although the rice stalks are withered and yellow, the rice grains are green in color like blue-black. In addition to being surprised, Chen peeled open a few grains to look at them. The rice grains had grown, but they were green and not white. So, he harvested the rice a few days ago, dried it in the sun, and husked more than one load to cook. To his surprise, the cooked porridge had large rice grains, but they were green in color like green jade, similar to mung bean soup. When eaten, it was similar to ordinary rice porridge. However, it had a slight aroma. When the neighbors heard about it, they all asked Chen for some to eat. They all said that this rice was a different kind of grain. Its body was soft and large, making it easiest to digest for the elderly. The nearby machine organs learned about this and specially bought a few loads from Chen to use as a reference for agricultural seeds.</p>

<p>— Wei Weiyi</p>
<p>In previous years, when I traveled to the old capital, I had nothing to do. Apart from buying wine and getting drunk, I often entertained myself by watching operas. The pool seats were extremely cheap, and the performers were excellent. Sometimes they were veteran performers from the imperial troupe, or newly debuted young talents. They sang stories of the Kaiyuan era and tales of the Tianbao era. With the wild goose zither and ivory clappers, my heart was filled with joy. Over time, it became a habit that I could not break. Later, when I came to Shanghai, I became a book copyist. My eyesight grew weaker and weaker. The theaters in Shanghai competed to display elaborate scenery, resplendent and colorful. Because my eyesight was poor and I lacked leisure time, I rarely went to see them. However, I developed a fondness for records. The lyrics of records, though extremely simple, were selected from the best parts of an opera, so every word was precious and worth listening to. The singers were either famous performers or famous amateurs. They had years of practice and could produce a stunning performance. Their voices could stop the clouds, enough to curb my addiction to opera and allow me to focus on research. I often purchased records from the Victor Talking Machine Company on Nanjing Road, sometimes as many as one hundred or more. They covered a wide range of roles: male, female, painted-face, and clown. Among them, those produced by Gaoting were the most numerous. Male roles were sung by Shu Yan, Qing Kui, Lian Liang, and Ju Ming. Female roles were sung by Shi Tou, Lan Fang, Yan Qiu, and Xiao Yun. Painted-face roles were sung by Gui Xian and Jun Feng (a record of Liu Po was especially rare). Clown roles were sung by Chang Hua and He Nian. The male roles were subtle and restrained, neither humble nor arrogant. The female roles were like long embankments and willow waves, newly tested oriole tongues. The painted-face roles were like the yellow bell and great lu, iron clappers and bronze drums. The clown roles were witty and humorous, extremely funny. Although I was in a small room, it was as if I had moved the talents of the northern lands and created a grand stage. Regarding Shi Tou and Liu Po, who have both passed away, I can still listen attentively to their recorded voices, as if they were right here. I truly have to give credit to records. I look north towards Yan Yun, using this to console myself. Therefore, I write this record.</p>

<p>— (Honglian)</p>
<p>During the autumn season, the weather is hot during the day and cool at night. People are susceptible to catching colds and harming their digestion through food. The stomach and intestines are most vulnerable to illness. Imbalances in the internal organs can disrupt the flow of fluids, affecting the liver and gallbladder, leading to dry and urgent bowel movements. If left untreated, this will inevitably lead to loss of appetite, headaches, dizziness, easy anger, and physical weakness, which can trigger other illnesses. You should quickly take "Nine-Refined Cooling Oil" or "Laxative Sugar-Coated Pills" from Jicheng Pharmacy to immediately generate fluids, lubricate the intestines, remove impurities, and cleanse the organs. With one bowel movement per day, your body will become healthier.</p>
<p>Or, evil qi can obstruct and stagnate moisture, causing the stomach to fail in its function, resulting in impotence, nausea, abdominal pain, intestinal rumbling, and diarrhea. If delayed treatment leads to malaria or dysentery, hundreds of complications can arise. You should quickly take "Ten-Thousand-Effective Diarrhea Medicine" or "Instant Diarrhea Relief Pills" from Jicheng Pharmacy to benefit the stomach, soothe the intestines, and unblock the three jiaos. Stopping diarrhea will be as easy as turning your hand.</p>
<p>Or, summer heat and dampness can lie dormant internally, while wind evils attack externally, leading to tenesmus and severe pain. You may need to frequently visit the toilet, with increasing pain but little relief. What is discharged may be white or red. This is dysentery, known as zhi xia in ancient prescriptions. Its condition is most complicated. If accompanied by closure and vomiting, it is called "jinkou dysentery," which is even more dangerous. You should quickly take "Ten-Thousand-Effective Dysentery Water" or "Ten-Thousand-Effective Dysentery Pills" from Jicheng Pharmacy to clear heat, resolve stagnation, promote dampness, and dispel turbidity, widening the intestines and relieving urgency and pain. Then the abdominal pain will stop.</p>
<p>Or, the abdomen can be chilled, obstructing the bile, leading to waves of abdominal pain, like stabbing or twisting, as well as bloating and fullness, and a sluggish stomach with food stagnation. You should quickly take "Instant Stomachache Relief Medicine" from Jicheng Pharmacy, which can be taken and provide relief immediately.</p>
<p>Jicheng Public Pharmacy is located at No. 166, West of the Ball Game Field on Nanjing Road, Shanghai. It has over 300 types of self-made effective medicines. The above-mentioned medicines for autumn stomach and intestinal ailments are particularly effective.</p>

<p>According to the statistics of the Times, since 1921, the cost of living has decreased by approximately 22.5%. During the same period, the rate of unemployment relief has increased by 13% for single men and 30% for married men with three children. Agricultural workers are the most impoverished and fertile class in England. They have no land and rely solely on their labor to support their families. Currently, if an agricultural worker is the father of three children, he can receive 32 shillings per week in unemployment relief, while he would only earn 35 shillings per week when working. It is human nature to love ease and hate labor. Would anyone prefer to work hard all day for an extra three shillings a week?</p>
<p>Let me cite a specific example as proof. A servant and his wife were both employed in a mansion, earning 100 to 120 pounds per year. After much deliberation, the servant suddenly resigned with his wife. When asked why, he replied that after careful calculation, the man would not work at all. His wife would only work part-time for two or three days a week. Their combined income would be better than before. Examples like this are too numerous to count.</p>
<p>Currently, British public opinion is criticizing the Unemployment Insurance Act established by the Labour cabinet this year, saying that the qualifications for receiving relief are too broad and the amount of relief is too large. This causes many workers to have wishful thinking, trying to avoid work and live without labor. This not only poses a risk of bankruptcy to the British economy but also contributes to the decline of national morality. According to various newspapers, in order to thoroughly solve the unemployment problem and save British industry, it is necessary to amend the social insurance law. Genuine unemployed workers should be given relief, but only enough to maintain their livelihood, and the payment of relief should be conditional on having fully paid into the insurance fund when employed. However, the various political parties have responded to this kind of proposal with a lukewarm attitude, unwilling to express any opinion. Why? Because it involves domestic politics, and any change would have a huge impact. Furthermore, they fear that this would cause resentment among workers, which would be very unfavorable to the party's future.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the solution to the unemployment problem in England depends on the revitalization of the world economy and the recovery of the Eastern market, but it is also closely related to domestic reforms. However, reforming domestic affairs requires long-term efforts and unwavering courage. Therefore, the MacDonald cabinet's current headache of two million unemployed workers is unlikely to be resolved in the near future.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Cui Zhu Sheds Tears, the Beauty's Heart is Broken; The Fragrance of Red Lotus Fades, the Maiden's Soul Departs</p>
<p>The father of the pitiful Cui Yun was both an honest man and a fool. Even if he had something to say, his wife's loud voice would scare away two of his three souls, and he wouldn't dare to say another word. And his daughter entered the hell of the brothel. Speaking of selling young children from good families into prostitution in Shanghai, there are various systems. Some are outright sales, some are pledges for ten years, some are pledges for three or five years, and some are package deals for a certain period. In short, it's all a life of imprisonment. Outright sales are like life imprisonment without parole. Ten years, five years, and three years are like fixed-term imprisonment. Even a package deal for a certain period is like doing hard labor for four months. However, the state establishes penalties to punish criminals. I ask, what crimes have those innocent and lovely little girls committed to deserve such suffering? Isn't this an injustice in society? Cui Yun was pledged to someone by Sister Xiu for ten years, starting from the age of fourteen and lasting until the end of her twenty-third year. This ten-year fixed-term imprisonment is almost equivalent to life imprisonment. Think about it, a woman's youth is entirely within those ten years. Those ten years are wasted in a life of imprisonment. Her life can be considered over. The family that takes the pledge also has to spend some money to feed her, clothe her, and teach her songs. When she reaches the legal age of sixteen, they have to put up a sign and have her sing on stage. Fortunately, if the child is obedient and the family is kind, she will suffer less. Otherwise, she will be beaten and scolded day and night, becoming as thin as a ghost. Many of them die from illness. There are countless such small wronged souls. Furthermore, if their bodies have not yet fully developed, and they are only thirteen or fourteen years old, the lecherous old turtles and wicked procuresses, disregarding life and death, only want money. Under duress, they receive those who indulge in bestial desires, disregarding humanity and breaking their maidenhood. The serious ones die, and the less serious ones suffer lifelong illnesses. Those things are commonplace. However, Cui Yun was lucky. She didn't lose her chastity until she was eighteen. The guest originally wanted to marry her, but unfortunately, there was also a shrew at home, so there was nothing he could do. He had to make up for this regret with money. He helped Cui Yun redeem herself. It can be seen that the life in the brothel is completely like the criminal system. Money is used as a ransom, and crimes can be redeemed with money. Their unwritten rules are to redeem at double the price. For example, if she was bought for three hundred dollars, it would cost six hundred dollars to redeem her. The same goes for pledges. In this case, someone needs to help, or consult a lawyer who protects flowers, or let the old men at their illegal court, the so-called tea party, decide whether to allow you to redeem yourself and be free. Otherwise, they will hold onto your body, and they can use any means. Because if they marry you off, it will be at least three thousand or five thousand dollars. In any case, it will be more than just double the redemption fee. Cui Yun was also lucky that this guest secretly helped her gain a little freedom.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Financial and Gold Market Fluctuations Unpredictable <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The situation is drifting. Yesterday, September 2nd, the gold market situation changed slightly. The total market had a fluctuation of about eight taels. However, the rise and fall were divergent, the situation was unstable, and the hearts of the people were restless, with the situation unpredictable. In the end, it still fell, and foreign exchange slightly weakened. The morning market tended to soften, but there were no special ups and downs, only a rise and fall of about three taels. Hengxing Taikangrun and other companies slightly increased their holdings, while Zhifeng Yongyuanshengxinxing and others sold off. The afternoon market suddenly saw a high peak, once breaking the sixty-tael mark. It was rumored that India had news of further sales of silver, and the market atmosphere soared. On the trading floor, buyers were brave and gathered like clouds, with Tai Dada Cheng Fuchang and others buying in groups. However, the industry center was psychologically hesitant and there was no large-scale trading, so the short side increased its margin and sold it back, so it was difficult to stand firm and it broke into the sixty-tael range again. It was actually a bluff. Since the big strips in the morning market only shrunk by one-sixteenth, the silver price has no market.</p>
<p>The morning market showed signs of weakness. The October gold price initially opened and fell by two taels and one qian, to five hundred and fifty-seven taels. The gross price fell to fifty-five taels and three qian, with the selling side very strong. After a while, there were some buyers and it rose by one tael and six or seven qian, for a total of fifty-seven taels. However, Yuancheng and others went in and out again, and people's hearts were not good. When the opening price in shillings was announced, it fell back to fifty-four taels and six or seven qian, the listed price did not change, at four taels. The domestic exchange rates were all loosening. Mitsui bought one tael, two qian, four fen, seven and five li of Japanese gold in October at one tael, two qian, four fen, six and two five li. Before long, retail investors and others bought in, so it increased by one tael to fifty-five taels. However, Xinxing and others rose up to compete for sales, and Japanese gold was even lower. Sumitomo and others bought in October at one tael, two qian, four fen and five li, so around 10 o'clock it fell to fifty-three taels and six or seven qian. Afterwards, Taikangrun and others successively took action and bought back, now jumping two taels or more, until after 11 o'clock it reached fifty-six taels and two qian. However, at that time, there was a tael of lurking, and afterwards, one tael and several qian were lost again, for a total of four taels and a half. By the time the market closed at noon, Hengxing and others slightly increased, for a total of fifty-five taels and three qian, the listed price was still six hundred and twenty-two taels and two qian, which is a press of sixty-seven or eight taels, sixty-six or seven taels at noon.</p>
<p>The evening opening was once high. The afternoon opening was fifty-four taels and six qian. Because the Indian exchange rate grew, it fell again to fifty-three taels and nine qian. In an instant, it was learned that India continued to sell silver bars, and people's hearts were all soaring, and for a time the wind rose and the clouds surged, and it soared directly outside of sixty taels, a sudden increase of eight taels or more. There were many buyers on the floor, but the supply was still lacking, so after 2:30 it reached sixty-two taels. Unexpectedly, people's hearts were uncertain, and the exchange market failed to tighten. Now, Standard Chartered Bank and HSBC sold English gold at seven pence and four three seven five in October, so it broke through sixty taels again. Zhifeng Yongxinxing and others had sales, causing them to be suppressed by five or six taels. However, from 2:30 to 3:30, it hovered around sixty-one taels. Afterwards, it gradually declined, until at 4 o'clock it was suddenly suppressed to fifty-six taels and one or two qian, and then there was a rise and fall of one or two taels, from eight taels and a half to seven taels and six or seven qian. However, there were not many strips in and out. When the market closed at 4:30, it was fifty-eight taels and two qian, which was a fall of nine qian compared to the day before yesterday. It was found that the maximum price in one day was sixty-two taels and the minimum price was fifty-three taels and six qian, for a difference of eight taels and four qian. The listed price was sixty-seven or eight taels to sixty-four taels, the booked price was sixty-six taels to fifty-five taels, the water was sixty-six taels, the goods opened at fifty-seven taels, fifty-five taels at noon, four taels and six qian in the afternoon, and the market closed at eight taels and one qian.</p>
<p>The entry and exit are divergent. The transactions of each number are uncertain. It is estimated that Dada Cheng, Yuan Maoyong, Yuancheng, Yuan Xingyong, Yuan Chengyong, and Sen Changyong have divergent entries and exits. Zhifeng Yong, Yuan Maoyong, Chen Chang, Yuan Dayong, Jin An, and Xinxing are all sold. Jinkang, Taikangrun, Hengxing, Bingxing, Huixiang, Wanxing, etc. are all entered. Yu Da and Shunli went in and out suddenly. In the afternoon, Dada Cheng, Fuchang, Yuan Maoyong, Cuitai, Bingxing, and hat numbers all bought in. Taikangrun, Zhifeng Yong, Jin An, Tong Taichang, Xinxing, etc. are roughly sold out. The Dalian gang still has no large transactions, and it is estimated that four or five hundred strips are sold, while seven or eight hundred strips are entered. The Guangdong gang also bought a small number.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Foreign Exchange Seems to Trend Weak <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listed prices showed no improvement in any exchange rate. Overseas silver market slightly contracted, and the US holiday was closed, so the US silver market was closed. The Bombay morning telegram was unchanged. The afternoon market was better than the morning, with slight growth. However, domestic prices for English, American, and Japanese exchange rates seemed to be trending weaker, with no special changes. It loosened from the morning, and was even tighter at noon. The afternoon turned flat. The gold market rose and fell, fluctuating by eight taels throughout the day, and advancing and retreating around sixty taels. However, the end result was slightly lower, so the last market price for exchange was a .0625 increase in English gold compared to the day before, a .125 increase in American gold, and a .115 decrease in Japanese gold. Chinese speculators still did not make large-scale trades, but English gold had few transactions in the morning. However, 50,000 to 60,000 pounds had been settled in the afternoon. Banks were still selling. It is estimated that East Asia, HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Mitsui had all sold. Banks also made tens of thousands of pounds among themselves. The US dollar was very quiet, while 500,000 to 600,000 yuan of Japanese gold was sold, and Mitsui, Taiwan, and Korea absorbed it. Most of it was the Dalian ticket.</p>

In the morning, the September price was 39 yuan .375, the buying price was 9 yuan .5, the October price was 9 yuan .5, and the November price was 9 yuan .625. The buying price was .75.

<h3 id="e172">The Big Strips Retracted .0625 <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>

<h3 id="e173">The Interest Rate Trend Is Downward, But The Foundation Is Still Solid <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: The market price of foreign interest rates has been sitting above 9% for a long time, and only recently has it broken into 9%, but it still hasn't been able to fall below. Because the foundation is solid and people's hearts are firm, it's not easy to decline at the moment. But currently, the mint is opening its furnace, and the source of new coins will soon be abundant, so it will be difficult for this interest rate to stand for long. Therefore, everyone is looking at the smaller side. As for the trend of silver funds, although there is no formal major need, the raw materials for minting coins are in great demand, and there may also be a possibility of adjustment and turnaround.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices: (Foreign Interest Rates) The morning market interest rate was 7 qian 2 fen 8 li 6 hao 2 hu and a half, which was slightly smaller by 1 hao 2 hu and a half compared to the previous day. The noon market was still the same as the morning market, and the trading situation was also chaotic, with no high or low interest rates, and the entry and exit followed the trend without competition. (Silver Interest Rates) The loosening of silver funds has become a habit. There was a slight two-point market the day before yesterday, but yesterday it actually opened a white loan again. The morning and noon markets were also not very different. The heading and adding water and bank listing prices were all not traded in the market.</p>
<p>Auxiliary Coin Market: The early market for Jiangnan small foreign coins was still 6 qian 4 fen 7 li, with no difference from the previous day's market price. The noon market was slightly better at 7 hao and a half, for 6 qian 4 fen 7 li 7 hao and a half. 6,000 jiao were traded in the early market, and 4,000 jiao were traded in the noon market. The early market for Guangdong small foreign coins was 6 qian 2 fen 5 li 2 hao and a half, which was better than the previous noon by 1 li. The noon market suddenly increased by 2 li 2 hao and a half, for 6 qian 2 fen 7 li and a half. 75,000 jiao were traded in the early market, and 50,000 jiao were traded in the noon market. Copper coins were slightly short by 500 wen, for 392,500 wen.</p>

Over 300,000 new coins were traded in both markets. 500,000 from the passenger route, and 800,000 was shipped out. Banks traded 400,000 in the early market, and 450,000 in the noon market.

Over 1.7 million in foreign heading funds were collected and delivered. Small Qianzhuang collected and exchanged banknotes and sold foreign exchange and spot foreign coins worth 560,000.</p>

<p>Yesterday's public bond market situation, the spot goods only opened at 60 yuan, and the futures were over 9.2 million. As for the changes in bond prices, the overall situation was still depressed. The major players on both the buying and selling sides in the market were still watching, so the supply and demand were balanced. Except for the disarmament, reorganization, and tariff issues, which fluctuated by about one yuan, the others only rebounded by a few jiao.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Cotton Yarn: The Yarn Market Remains Mediocre <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, but the trend is still softening. The domestic war is unstable, the purchasing power of all parties is weak, and the raw cotton is sluggish, so the situation is flat. The pressure on the selling side is increasing, and the buyers are relatively scarce. Most targets must look at breaking through the 50 tael mark. It is found that new throwing households have not been enthusiastic in the recent market, so although the environment is bad, the decline has not been fierce and may be able to hover for the time being.</p>
<p>The Human Standard Emotion is Extremely Flat. The early opening of the Human Standard was weak due to the lack of buyers and the weakness of the market atmosphere. However, some profiteers took the opportunity to empty the space, so they rose after falling first. As a result, each month rose and fell by one, two, or three qian. In the afternoon, the foreign cotton news was not good, and each fell by one, two, or three qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 6,650 bales. It was found that Shenxin sold 550 bales, Gongtai 400 bales, Tianchang 650 bales, and Yiyu Hengde Rongxing Xiesheng Maoji 250 to 350 bales. Yichang bought 1,200 bales, and Yicheng Yiyu Shenchang Xincheng 200 to 350 bales. The closing price of the Human Standard is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Human Standard Closing Price, Rise and Fall, Balance Count:</p>
<p>Closing Price, Rise and Fall, Balance Count</p>
<p>September: 1542, Fell 2, 22,200</p>
<p>October: 1534, 40,300</p>
<p>November: 1531, 138,650</p>
<p>December: 1530, Fell 2, 28,050</p>
<p>January: 1530, 19,950</p>
<p>February: 1531, 110,500</p>
<p>The current sale is just so-so. The current sales of yarn are still flat. It was found that each gang bought a total of 850 bales during the day, and 800 bales entered the same industry. The market situation was flat and tired. The Guangdong gang entered 145 bales, the mainland entered 80 bales, Tianjin entered 130 bales, Xuzhou entered 50 bales, Sichuan entered 230 bales, the two foreign countries entered 145 bales, and the miscellaneous gang entered 70 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Han Standard Market Strongly Rises on All Sides <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market remains firm, likely because the weather is sometimes cloudy and sometimes sunny, making people's minds unsettled. Both American and Indian cotton have suspended trading, so the buying force is becoming stronger, resulting in a tighter market. However, new buyers are still lacking, and current cotton sales are unusually sluggish. Factories are taking a calm approach, and so are the Japanese factories. In previous years, at this time, Japanese merchants would be eagerly collecting cotton, but this year Indian cotton has been sufficient, so there is no need for temporary procurement. Osaka's Three Commodities market for yarn and cotton is flat and weak. A major yarn factory in this port received a telegram from its Hankou branch stating that it had rained there for three days, but now the weather has cleared up, and the new cotton harvest looks promising.</p>
<p>Standard Tightening - The Hankou standard market opened with most people expecting a high price, and buyers taking a strong and rising attitude, so the market atmosphere was tight. However, there were not many new buyers, resulting in a flat outcome. In the afternoon, the market opened with rain, and the bulls raised the price again by 1 cent. At closing, news of poor American cotton caused the price to fall again, resulting in a near rise of 5 cents to 1 cent, then a fall of 5 cents. The total daily trading volume was 23,300 dan.</p>
<p>Bought in: Gongtai 3,300 dan, Yuanda 1,300 dan, Tongxing 1,900 dan, Yiyu 1,400 dan, Ruikang 500 dan, Xincheng 700 dan.</p>
<p>Sold out: Yichang 1,500 dan, Yongfeng 1,700 dan, Gengfeng 1,100 dan, Maoji 1,300 dan, Tianlong 1,400 dan, Shenchangrui, Dali Chang, and Jinfeng 800 dan to 1,000 dan.</p>
<p>The closing prices of Han standard cotton are listed on the left:</p>

<p>February 33.35, up 0.05, 4,800</p>
<p>Spot Goods Sluggish - Spot cotton trading remains sluggish. The source is estimated to be 2,030 bales of Yaohua cotton.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Food - Rice Market Gradually Rises <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei - Yesterday, very few boats arrived from the river, and the demand from various gangs was quite strong. The price of Northern Gang white broken rice reached 21 yuan in bulk, reaching the limit price. Ordinary Zhongguan rice all rose by 2-3 jiao or so. It is noted that the recent market situation for japonica rice is influenced by the production market in the interior, and the new goods could not continue to be strong. In addition, many foreign rice shipments were re-exported, and inventories were thin. Although there is a rumor of Xianggan rice being wholesaled to Shanghai, there is currently no certainty, leading to a sharp rise in prices. Very few East Xin japonica rice arrived, and rice mills showed a weak willingness to sell, so the market improved again by 3-5 jiao, with the opening price at 18.45 yuan, and ordinary rice at 18.12 yuan, with very strong buying interest. New Ke Xian rice is ostensibly hovering around 14 yuan, but in reality, medium-quality rice has risen by about 2 jiao. These goods are readily accepted upon arrival, but only customers are inquiring, leading to a shift from flat to tight. Thin rice sales are acceptable, but arrivals are scarce and lack luster, so the market is slightly firmer. The White Yuan market is unfavorable, as the price has risen too sharply in recent days, leading to a lack of buying interest, while cargo merchants inevitably hold a desire to sell quickly. As a result, the bulk price has fallen slightly by 1-2 jiao, with high-quality goods still around 19 yuan.</p>
<p>Hu Nan - Fewer boats continue to arrive from the river. Buyers in this street are not paying attention due to the slight cargo volume. Although they are slightly selective in their purchases, transactions inevitably become thinner. High-quality broken rice is increasingly quiet. Prices have no standard because sources are intermittent, so they mostly follow the Beishi market. As for medium and lower-quality goods, there is also only slight trading, and the trend is still good. The market surface shows an increase of 1-2 jiao, with goods like Tongli rice all in the range of 17.8 yuan. New japonica rice sources are slightly visible, and sales are very good, with prices gradually rising by half a yuan, opening at 18-17.5 yuan. New Yangjian rice arrivals and sales are evenly matched, with most being sold out as soon as they arrive. High-quality goods are around 15 yuan, about 1.5 jiao higher than the previous market. White Yuan inventories and arrivals are both scarce, and the market is very quiet, with prices similar to those in Hu Bei.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Tapioca Flour Market Continues to Show Weakness <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tapioca flour market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month still showed signs of weakness, and trading was also exceptionally sluggish. Because Tianjin has changed to ordering foreign flour due to food-related reasons after Shanghai flour was banned from loading. Foreign firms are also selling because the exchange rate is close, and they are directly delivered, so the Shanghai market is actually being blocked from sales. Although manipulators are not completely disheartened and unwilling to let go, in fact, the support of Shanghai flour and the inability to export indirectly add a new path for foreign flour to come to China. If the factory throws down more weight or the market situation becomes flat, the result will be fatigue. In the end, this month is down a little 0.25 cents, October is down a little 0.75 cents, November and December are down a little 0.5 cents, January is down a little 0.75 cents, and February is down a little 1.5 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Wheat Futures Market Unanimously Slackens <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month all showed a flat and weak trend. The current month saw a continuous arrival of goods, and in view of the fearful repetition of the previous month, the bulls were weak and unbearable. Although there was no price quotation for foreign wheat for the deferred months, the need for wheat may be reduced due to Tianjin's continuous ordering of foreign flour, so people are also very pessimistic. As a result, the current month is down a little 1 cent compared to the previous day, October to January are down a little 2 cents, and February is up 1 cent. In the spot wheat market, high-quality goods were called up by 1-2 cents due to the continued movement of factories, while medium and lower-quality goods remained flat. 6,500 packages of Taierzhuang, Xuzhou Yao, Shashi, and Haizhou wheat were opened and purchased by Fufeng and Shen Da.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Sugar Market - Daily Sugar Market Sees Gradual Rise <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Due to Rumors of Minghua Factory Temporarily Suspending Operations</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegrams: There were no telegrams for Cuban spot sugar and New York futures sugar. Java spot sugar price was 8.875, and futures refined sugar was 8.75 in September and 8.625 in October, with no increase or decrease compared to the previous telegram. The Public Association market was divided. Although the buying interest for Dutch sugar 24-grade coarse sand white was quiet, the market shape was still firm. White bagged new goods were 7 taels 9 qian 5 fen, high-quality goods were 8 taels, oil-bagged goods were 7 taels 8 qian 5 fen, and finely ground sand white was 8 taels 0.05 fen. The market shape was quite good due to the lack of ex-warehouse goods. The Japanese sugar market turned better because Minghua Factory's raw materials were thin and will suspend production after the 10th, which caused popularity to turn better and the price to gradually rise. The market price also saw a gradual rise. N mark was 7 taels 9 qian, J mark was 8 taels 1 qian, SH mark was 7 taels 8 qian 2.5 fen, Minghua YRO mark was 7 taels 7 qian 5 fen, YT mark was 7 taels 8 qian 2.5 fen, and YP mark was 7 taels 9 qian 5 fen. Transactions were quite active, and the price rose by 2.5 fen compared to the previous day, and the market was stable.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Wufu White Ice Has Already Been Shipped <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Wufu White Ice's sales have been launched in recent days, and the Shanghai market's inventory is thin and is about to run out. The management company has telegraphed to urge shipments. It is heard that the Taigu Company's Taiyuan vessel, imported from Xiamen, has rushed to load more than a hundred boxes to respond to the market. With the arrival of autumn sales, there may be hope for a rise in price. However, unified ice has a large inventory and the trend is still weak.</p>

<p>Sluggish Customer Sales... Market Shape Flat</p>
<p>Since the launch of new black melon seeds, arrivals have been quite strong. Recently, nearly 5,000 packages have arrived. Yesterday, it was heard that Zhenbang companies and Nan Shi grain and oil stores opened a total of more than 2,000 packages, with Xukui seeds priced at 10 taels to 1234 qian, and Dangshan seeds priced at 10 taels 6 qian, which is 4 qian lower than before for Xu Kui seeds. There is not much fluctuation, but the current market is very weak, because there are not many transactions with export groups, and only domestic groups are purchasing. The market is flat.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Silk and Tea - Zhejiang Hangzhou Autumn Silkworm Season is Quite Good <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Currently, the Majority of Leaves are Lush... Early Silkworms Can Emerge from the Fire</p>
<p>Farmers in the four rural areas of Hangzhou County, Zhejiang Province, are breeding autumn silkworms due to the profits made from spring and summer silkworms this year. In addition, silk merchants are promoting and government offices are distributing silkworm eggs, doubling the amount of feeding. After the ants were collected, the climate was suitable, and the silkworm ants developed smoothly. Although there were strong winds, thunderstorms, and sudden cold and heat, the impact was minimal due to the running and guidance of instructors. Currently, the majority of leaves are lush, and early silkworms can emerge from the fire, and the silkworm season is quite good.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Lvzhuang Green Tea Exports to Europe Turn Smooth <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the tea market of foreign firms in this port, English and French firms showed slightly active interest in Lvzhuang's Zhenmei, Zhenmei Needle, and Xiumei green teas. However, the tea price of Zhenmei has fallen to the extreme. According to the current open market, tea from the Wuyuan North Road is 20 taels lower, tea from Tunxi and Wudong is 30 taels lower, and tea from Shexian and Suian is 40-50 taels lower. In addition, there is still a lot of tea in stock in the market, and the Russian firm's opening is indefinite. It seems that the market is still difficult to reverse the downward trend. Tea merchants generally hold deep worries about this market situation.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Piece Goods - Autumn Sales Active and Prices Gradually Rise <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The piece goods market is becoming more and more robust. Fine broadcloth, straight satin, tribute flannel, etc., seem to be rising sharply. Actual sales and purchases are very strong, especially the Tianjin groups' purchases are continuing. Transactions involve 300-400 pieces. This street's buying interest is also strong due to the increasing activity of domestic wholesale, so people's hearts are very excited. Fine broadcloth rose by 2.5-7.5 cents yesterday. Gu Cheng Hui has opened at 3 qian 1.5 fen, Baoqiu at 2 qian 9.5 fen, Huxinting at 2 qian 6 fen, Zijinshan at 2 qian 5.5 fen, and Huanle at 2 qian 5 fen 7.5 li. The speed of the rise is only seen in this geng. Straight satin, First Merit already requires 3 qian, Four Scholars at 2 qian 9.5 fen. Other items such as straight flannel, smooth twill, chongsu silk, and foreign red labels are all thriving. Only the two items of colored velvet soft smooth twill remained flat yesterday. Customer sales were most active among Tianjin and domestic groups. Sales from the Changsha group were sold out due to the rampancy of the Communist bandits, but the price of goods was not affected.</p>
<h3 id="e187">New Autumn Wool Goods and Flannel Have Been Launched <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>With the arrival of the new autumn season and the cool weather, transactions of wool goods and flannel are gradually being launched. Customer groups such as Sichuan, Jiangxi, Tianjin, and Hankou all have considerable needs. Small customer groups such as Luli, the capital, Suhang, Shaoyong, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and Wuhu also have added purchases, but their transactions are mostly sporadic, not as large as the bulk shipments of the North Sichuan groups. This is because of the distance of the route. Also, the merchants on this street will gradually bring their goods to market as the weather turns cooler, so most are purchasing in advance. Yesterday, store numbers, and Western clothing, shoe and hat workshops, new clothing stores, etc., all had sample requests and purchases, with both original boxes and loose pieces being traded. The market atmosphere of the Public Association suddenly improved, and the sales prices of various goods were extremely firm.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Miscellaneous - Cement Sales Smooth After Price Reduction <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Elephant brand cement sales are smooth after the price reduction. Bagged goods are most popular among buyers. In recent days, more than 30,000-40,000 barrels have been sold. The price is 3 taels 1 qian 5 fen for bagged goods and 3 taels 0.5 fen for barreled goods (the above are all ex-warehouse list prices). The prices for delivery and ex-warehouse are added separately by 1-2 qian or so. The Qixin brand Horse brand is still sold for 3 taels 7 qian 5 fen (barreled goods) and 3 taels 2 qian 5 fen (bagged goods). Export transactions are still available. The local construction groups are very rare. Recently, it was heard that the price of Japanese goods is also falling due to the impact of domestic goods.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Theater News <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Xindongfang Theater, located north of Yokohama Bridge on North Sichuan Road, declares: Our theater has magnificent architecture and complete organization, making it the most suitable and comprehensive stage of the modern era. It aims to promote national opera and emerging opera. The directors are all prominent figures and celebrities in the theater industry, and the preparations have taken years to complete. It has now been decided to open on September 3rd, starting at 7:30 pm, with performances of improved national opera and opera. The national opera program is a sorrowful factual drama "The Female Escort," written by Hu Shaoyu and directed by Feng Zihe, starring Ms. Min Cuiying. The plot is completely realistic, with touching beauty and spectacle. The entire play features more than 30 actors and requires more than two hours to perform. There are also six magnificent stage sets, matched with reasonable costumes and beautiful music, making it interesting and captivating. The opera program is a historical story drama "Wang Zhaojun," starring Ms. Li Lian from the [unclear] Society. The plot is tragic and the songs are moving, containing literary poetry and great value. The ticket prices are also extremely affordable, ranging from 40 cents, 60 cents, 80 cents, and one yuan. It is expected that there will be a bustling scene with carriages and horses at that time.</p>
<p>Lianyi Film Company declares: Our company has been preparing for more than a year, and all the progress has been properly arranged. It is now scheduled to start shooting the martial arts adventure epic "Tai Chi Dart," written by playwright Li Changjian, on the 5th of this month. The plot is bizarre and tortuous, completely breaking the hypocrisy of gods and monsters with real martial arts skills. Mr. Li spent one and a half years of painstaking effort writing this script, revising it seven or eight times. In addition, it stars the strongman Zha Ruilong and the long-famous movie star Ran Saizhen, truly a perfect match, opening a new era for domestic films. The company's office is temporarily located at 245 Yipin Lane, Baoshan Road, Zhabei.</p>
<p>Paris Grand Theater declares: Starting today, we will screen "Passionate Courageous Love Crossing the Sea to Avenge Injustices," co-starring Ramon Novarro and Joan Crawford. The film tells the story of two brothers who misunderstand each other because of a woman, leading to animosity. Later, the younger brother crosses the sea to Singapore to explain the misunderstanding, but unfortunately, the elder brother is killed by a villain. The plot is tortuous and full of twists and turns, with both humor and solemnity. The wonderful scenery of the sea is rarely seen by the world, and the mysterious images in Singapore's dance halls and bars are even more worth seeing.</p>
<p>Zhabei Renewal Stage declares: Since the opening performance of the first part of "Journey to the West," the box office has been consistently strong for nearly four months. Therefore, we have specially continued to stage the second part, with colorful scenery and mechanisms, striving for perfection, novelty, and mystery, creating a new record in the stage industry. There are also real dogs on stage, who know the rhythm, and fake horse performances, which closely resemble real horses. All kinds of peculiarities are pleasing to the eye. It is scheduled to be performed on Thursday evening this week. In recent days, many people have been coming to reserve seats, one after another, knowing that there will be a sea of people and a sensation in Shanghai at that time.</p>
<p>China Grand Theater on Zha Pu Road and Hai Ning Road declares: Since its opening, our theater has been well-received by the public due to its careful selection of films, and the business has been very prosperous. Yesterday, we changed to "Little Bush," a masterpiece co-starred by the three major stars Eddie Cantor, Clara Bow, and Lidorof. It is a famous film of romantic, humorous, fragrant, enchanting, and interesting love of the time. The seats are full three times a day and night.</p>
<p>Fusheng Road Baixing Grand Theater declares: Since the opening of "Jungle Adventure," our theater has been well-received by all walks of life, and the seats are full every day.

<p>Respectfully Seeking a Formula for Stomach Cancer</p>
<p>My wife has stomach cancer, cannot eat, and medicine is ineffective. She vomits blue-green and coffee-colored water mixed with white greasy substances like phlegm several times a day, which is extremely painful. According to Western medicine, this disease is caused by a tumor in the stomach and must be surgically removed to have a chance of survival. However, my wife has both wet fever and stomach cancer. The wet fever has now completely healed, but her body is extremely weak. It has been more than 40 days since the onset of the disease, and she has not eaten. How can such a weak body withstand surgery? However, I cannot bear to sit and wait for her to die. Therefore, I am specially publishing this notice to seek kind-hearted famous doctors and request a good formula that can bring her back to life. If you can help, I will never forget your kindness for generations to come. If you have any advice, please send it to the Accounting Department of the China Merchants Bureau in Shanghai, addressed to me as a thank you. Wu Bo'an respectfully bows.</p>

<p>A Field Survey of Travel in Northern Europe - Unimaginable Fairy Mountains on the Sea</p>
<p>A special correspondent for the World News Agency in Northern Europe writes: The Western words "Suede" for Sweden and "Suisse" for Switzerland share the same origin. Their meaning probably implies seclusion. To translate them into Chinese with the closest sound and meaning, Sweden should be called 遯國 (Dùn Guó, "Secluded Country" - the character 遯 quite closely matches the sound of "Sweden"). The tranquility of Switzerland is most appropriately described as 隱國 (Yǐn Guó, "Hidden Country"). When transportation was underdeveloped in the Middle Ages, these two countries, with their dense forests, were convenient for avoiding chaos. During the recent outbreak of the European War, neither Sweden nor Switzerland was drawn into the conflict. The great powers seemed to forget about them, allowing the people of these two countries to enjoy the happiness of peace alone. Deep in the clouds and mountains, undisturbed by the sounds of chickens and dogs, like a paradise on earth, unexpectedly reappearing today - truly enviable! The meaning of "Norvege" for Norway is "Northern Country," a new nation that separated from Sweden. Although it doesn't have a name implying seclusion on the surface, in reality, it is still part of the "Secluded Country." However, its northern end has Nordkapp, a city where the sun never sets during the summer, making it even further north than the "Secluded Country." China is the country with the most troubles in the world. The Chinese people, separated by countless mountains, naturally cannot imagine the tranquility of the Northern Countries. Except for ten years ago when the International Women's Conference was held in Os-lo, the capital of the Northern Country, when Ms. Luo Kang Tongbi, the Chinese representative, selected scenic spots and wrote poems, there has been no news since, and no one has remembered this human paradise for a long time. The Chinese people have endured much turmoil and do not have the fortune to travel to this peaceful country, not even in their dreams. Isn't this regrettable? According to Mr. He Yuesun, who has preached and lectured in various Northwest European countries, "In places like Sweden and Norway, there are almost no Chinese footprints. When I worked for the Norwegian Youth Association, I traveled all over the country's cities. Over the years, I only found three Chinese people. One was a Cantonese man named Xiang Lin, with the Western name Andreas Tang Wa, who had lived in Norway for over twenty years but could not speak Norwegian. His livelihood was extremely difficult. I helped raise money to buy him a small boat so he could fish by the sea to make a living. He lived in a poor area, and his housing was rent-free, so he could barely survive. Another person, surnamed Huang (or Wang, it's hard to tell), was bought by a French circus performer to go to Europe. Unable to endure the hardship, he escaped midway. At the time, he was only eight years old and could no longer speak Chinese. The Norwegians helped him enter school, and he can now speak the local dialect and works in a restaurant. The third person was a woman who married a Norwegian sailor and lived in a small seaside village. Her family was quite comfortable. She could speak English, quite grammatically, and also Norwegian. She seemed to have received a better education. She claimed her father was a governor and hated the Republic of China. He once asked her for a small photo, but she said that she followed her mother's teaching, 'After marrying, follow your husband. Without her husband's permission, she cannot give away photos.' When I traveled to Sweden, I also found three Chinese people. One was Mr. Zhongzhang, the son of the former ambassador, Mr. Chaisheng, who lived with his remarried mother. He was studying various languages, and his environment was very good. The second was Miss Zhao, a former Manchu bannerwoman stationed in Jingzhou, who fled to Europe with a foreign missionary during the war. She is now in school studying general subjects. The third person was a Korean woman named Choi Young-sook, who was excellent in Chinese and also fluent in Swedish. She recently graduated from the social service college introduced by the Swedish church. Judging from her usual words and deeds, she is determined to become a Chinese citizen. These six people, alone, during the days when China was filled with war, peacefully lead a hermit's life in Scandinavia north of the ocean, rarely interacting with outsiders, giving people the feeling of 'Only in this mountain, where clouds are deep and unknown.' I remember that a senior colleague in our newspaper once used the pseudonym 'Secluded Elder of the Southern Sky' because he had experienced so much upheaval. Now, like the six people mentioned above, living peacefully in Sweden and Norway in the northern part of the Scandinavian Peninsula, no matter what their environment is, they are all leisurely 'Hermits North of the Mountain.' As for Denmark, in the southern part of the Scandinavian Peninsula, there are many overseas Chinese and frequent interactions, unlike the 'Secluded Country' that can sever ties with the world."

<h3 id="e218">2.5 Million Unemployed in the United States <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>With Various Exceptions, the Total Number is Very Large</p>
<p>New York News: The US government announced that, according to a census in April, the total number of unemployed in the United States was more than 2.5 million, or 2% of the total population, and 5.5% of the total labor force. The highest unemployment rate was in Michigan, which includes the automobile industry center of Chicago. New York State had 365,000 people. In absolute numbers, this is about one-sixth of the total of 2.5 million. Although far less than the predicted 3 million to 6 million, this survey had various exclusions, such as: (1) Those who have the ability to work, although not unemployed, but have not received wages and have been on long-term leave. This was the most common situation, especially among coal miners, which is actually the same as unemployment. (2) Those who are in the same situation as the above but are on short-term leave. (3) Unemployed people who are unable to work due to illness. (4) Those who are unemployed but are not currently urgently seeking employment. (5) Unemployed people who have other income and do not worry about food and clothing. The total number of unemployed since April, including the above items, will reach a huge number. As Mr. Raibik, the director of the New York City Free Employment Agency, said, there are 250,000 unemployed union members in the city alone. Including those outside the union, the total will reach 500,000.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Britain and the United States Strive to Expand Their Air Forces <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>And Compete to Build Excellent Ships</p>
<p>Tokyo News: Although the British Naval Conference stipulated a treaty on auxiliary vessels for Britain, the United States, and Japan, the tendency of various countries to expand their air forces and compete to build excellent ships outside the treaty has gradually become apparent. Currently, the Japanese Navy is seeking to strengthen its naval aviation forces to counter the United States. This trend is also extremely enthusiastic in Britain and the United States, and the government and the public are eagerly seeking to strengthen it. The following is a record of the naval aviation policies and current status of military strength of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Britain</p>
<p>The Air Force is unified under the Air Ministry and divided into domestic and overseas forces, including naval cooperation teams and army cooperation teams. The aviation policy aims to defend against the French Air Force's military strength. Among them, the naval cooperation team aims for the US Navy and seeks to expand and prepare it. On the one hand, it emphasizes rapid transportation and communication and troop movement on territories spread all over the world, and strives to improve the mobility of aircraft. For example, the UK-India, UK-Australia, and UK-Africa connection flights are examples of this. The military strength is 74 squadrons, including 11 fleet aviation squadrons, with 85 first-line aircraft, 54 reserve aircraft, for a total of 1,390 aircraft. Among them, there are 150 fleet aircraft. It is planned to increase the independent squadrons for domestic defense to 52 squadrons by 1930, and to increase the fleet aviation squadrons to approximately 200 aircraft by the end of 1931. In addition, there are two large rigid airships, R-100 and R-101, which have recently completed air entry. The Air Force budget for 1929 was 6.2 million pounds.</p>
<p>United States</p>
<p>Unlike Britain's unified Air Force, the Navy and Army each have directly affiliated aviation units, like Japan. The aviation policy aims to be the world's number one and is steadily seeking to strengthen it. The policy of naval aviation equipment is to prioritize the strengthening of fleet aviation squadrons. The current military strength of the fleet aviation squadrons is 30 squadrons. The land-based units equipped in Hawaii and the Panama area and other important locations are approximately 20 squadrons. The naval aviation squadrons are 10 squadrons, for a total of 60 squadrons. There are also 10 reserve aviation squadrons. The number of aircraft is approximately 1,000 first-line aircraft. In addition, it has been decided to build two rigid large airships of 6 million cubic feet, larger than the German Xu Bolin and British R-100, one of which has already begun construction. The naval aviation budget for 1930 is 31.34 million gold dollars. By the end of 1931, the US naval aviation aircraft will have 1,000 first-line units. According to the provisions of the London Treaty, one-quarter of the total tonnage of cruisers under 10,000 tons can be equipped with flight decks. If the US Navy equips these ships with aircraft, the number will increase further. The greatness of the United States' aircraft manufacturing capacity is unparalleled in the world. It is said that during a national mobilization, it can produce 15,000 aircraft in the first twelve months.</p>

<p>Nine Countries Plan to Establish an Association</p>
<p>Budapest News: Yugoslavia, Romania, and Hungary recently sent representatives to Sinaia to discuss methods of cooperative sales of agricultural products in order to resist the competition of American agricultural products in the European market. Poland supported this move and submitted a memorandum advocating the establishment of an international agricultural agreement by nine Central European countries. The memorandum was delivered to the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Polish Ambassador to Hungary, Mr. Bapingsiji. The content roughly stated that the current sluggish agricultural market cannot be salvaged without an international association. For this purpose, a conference should be held among Bulgaria, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Lithuania, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Poland to discuss and formulate methods for self-defense. Poland also proposed that these nine countries establish a permanent agricultural secretariat in Geneva to represent the nine countries when discussing agricultural issues. Yugoslavia expressed sympathy for this proposal. Its Foreign Minister, Mr. Malinkovic, is drafting a plan. At the same time, grain exporters from Southern Hungary and Romania also met to discuss this issue, advocating the establishment of a central organization to promote agricultural products. Bulgaria has expressed its willingness to join.</p>

<p>The High Unemployment is Unexpected - Railway Unrest is Brewing</p>
<p>London News: The number of unemployed people in Britain has recently increased again. Unemployment usually increases after the bank holiday in August each year, but this time it actually increased to 39,270 people, which was unexpected. Currently, the total number of unemployed people in Britain has exceeded any previous unemployment figures except during the coal miners' strike in 1921. The government and the Liberal Party are still secretly negotiating a new policy to deal with unemployment, but the public is not optimistic about the outcome. There is currently a trend to reduce unemployment benefits by two shillings per week. Railway companies are implementing large-scale layoffs due to reduced railway revenue, and unrest is brewing among railway personnel.</p>

<p>(1) Wheat must be grown more. 10% of the land in Central and Western Germany must be used for wheat.</p>
<p>(2) Reclaim wasteland and turn it into fertile land. Plant trees on dry sandy land.</p>
<p>(3) Rice may not be imported without the permission of the Association in order to protect the market for domestic rice. Rice must be graded according to quality and priced appropriately.</p>
<p>(4) Next year, establish a one-year milk association to greatly reduce the production price of milk. Change to new methods of raising cattle.</p>
<p>(5) Farmers and pig farmers should each organize associations.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Canada's Trade with China Develops <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Due to Increased Imports of Wheat Flour</p>
<p>Canada's trade with China has shown significant development in recent years. The main reason is the increase in Chinese consumption of wheat flour. Before the European War, the value of Chinese exports to Canada was greater than Canadian exports to China. Recently, the opposite has occurred. An examination of the country's export trade to China in 1929 (fiscal year) shows that the total amount was 22.317 million gold dollars, of which wheat flour accounted for 11 million gold dollars, followed by silver at 3.37 million gold dollars. Other major exports to China were fish at 1 million gold dollars, timber at 330,000 gold dollars, automobiles at approximately 100,000 gold dollars, and paper and lead tin also had considerable amounts.</p>

<p>— Ji Ren</p>
<p>From Flower Car to Armored Car</p>
<p>When automobiles first appeared, passenger cars were viewed as "flower cars" (i.e., parade cars). Only wealthy merchants and powerful figures could afford to purchase them. Their purpose was simply out of curiosity. Riding in automobiles was considered a new form of entertainment. Now, however, automobiles have become a modern transportation tool. Even luxurious automobiles are inexpensive, and ordinary people can afford them.</p>
<p>Trucks were even later to develop. They have only been in circulation for thirty years. Because of their sturdiness and economy, they have long been used as transportation tools. As for how the first truck was manufactured, what it looked like, and whether it utilized a passenger car or another vehicle to install a motor to power it, there is no way to study it now.</p>
<p>According to most speculations, the earliest trucks were built by carriage makers. The wooden body contained an engine, driving gears, and a cargo bed. In reality, it was similar to a parade car.</p>
<p>This type of transportation vehicle had limited capacity and a narrow range of uses. Therefore, there was a motivation to promote mechanized trucks for construction to meet emergency needs, to transport food, livestock, oil, coal, bricks, stones, ammunition, money, lumber, and various other items. There was also a need for various types of chassis and bodies for businesses and stores to suit their needs, so that they could get satisfactory, fast, and stable service. Special modifications were also possible.</p>
<p>Now, taking the transportation of food and livestock as an example, ten years ago, the milk supply for major cities relied on trains and small carts. Today, however, all food, rice, wheat, flour, vegetables, and livestock are transported by trucks. Now, various companies and factories not only use trucks as an economical and fast means of transportation, but also use them as mobile advertisements throughout the city. The widespread use and effectiveness of trucks are now well known to everyone.</p>
<p>In addition to trucks, there are now escort vehicles, commonly known as armored cars. The steel-shelled body is fully armed to transport gold, silver, stocks, precious metals, and valuable items. The ones used by large banks and companies in major cities today are specially equipped to be safe and secure, without any chance of loss. The latest trucks are escort vehicles with fast speed, sturdy bodies, low and wide chassis, and sufficient weight. The window glass and windshield glass are bulletproof and will never shatter. The front and rear doors are tightly locked and blocked by iron bars. The rear door cannot be opened unless the front door is activated. It is managed by a guard to prevent the driver's conspiracy, thereby ensuring the driver's safety. The roof and rear of the car are equipped with machine guns to prevent robbery and resist unexpected attacks. The evolution of trucks can be said to be sophisticated today.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Ford Expands Factories in China <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— (Huang Yingdai)</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, Mr. William C. Cowling, an important official of the American Ford Motor Company, came to China from the United States. He stayed in Shanghai for several days and recently departed from Shanghai to Manchuria and the northern provinces of China to conduct inspections. Mr. Cowling's sole purpose on this trip is to plan the expansion of Ford's business in China based on the conditions in various parts of China. In recent years, Ford has paid close attention to China's economic situation and conditions in various regions. The plan to expand its factories in China has long been in its heart.</p>
<p>During Mr. Cowling's stay in Shanghai, he was warmly welcomed by Chinese and Westerners and was very busy with social engagements. On the day of his departure to the north, Mr. Cowling told people that although he had not stayed in Shanghai for many days, he had a deep impression of Shanghai and the surrounding areas. He firmly believes that although China is in a state of chaos today, it will be the only automobile market in the Far East in the future. Because the provinces of China are actively developing, the sales of automobiles will have great development, which can be asserted. Mr. Cowling also shared Ford's economic observations with the people of Shanghai. Ford said, "Money and wealth cannot be regarded as the same thing. Wealth is derived from the people's experience, evolution, and efforts. As for money itself, it is completely powerless. Its existence depends on wealth. Without wealth, money is useless. Development and wealth should not be confused as one thing. Development is the flow of wealth. The two can be independent of each other and have no mutual relationship. Sometimes, the government of a country holds great wealth, while the people are quite poor. In other words, the people can also possess great resources, while the government is extremely poor. Therefore, wealth can sometimes make people rich and at the same time make them poor, possessing two opposite forces. The best power is the ability to build a solid foundation for general development." Ford's recent business plans are based on this principle. The salaries of employees and general business policies are also carried out accordingly.</p>
<p>Recently, various industries in the United States have experienced stagnation, and the wages of employees have also been reduced as a result. However, Ford is different. It has increased its spending in factories. Its vision is also conceivable. Ford believes that in order to seek the development of the business, one must first seek to increase the purchasing power of the society. In short, Ford's various business policies are not based on a compassionate and loving heart, but on a deep understanding of social economic principles. Therefore, it is still eager to expand the scope of its business. Recently, Ford has also paid extraordinary attention to road development, because the development of roads can increase the power of transportation. Therefore, Ford will personally attend the Road Research Conference held in the United States next year and express his opinions.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Cowling's visit to Shanghai, he was also quite satisfied in his heart. After an inspection, he already had a clue as to the location of the new factory. Ford had already mentioned in various American newspapers that it would establish a large-scale new factory in China, and Shanghai was considered the most suitable place to set up the factory. The problem of setting up a factory can be carried out according to its findings after Mr. Cowling returns to Shanghai in September.</p>
<p>Investigation</p>
<h3 id="e227">Overview of Public and Private Roads in Zhejiang Province <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Based on statistical reports from the Zhejiang Construction Department.</p>
<p>Explanation of the Process: The planning and construction of roads in Zhejiang began as early as 1920. In 1922, the Zhejiang Provincial Road Bureau was formally established, using tobacco taxes as funding for road construction. By 1926, the Xiaoshao section of the Zhejiang-Fujian Line was open to traffic. Completed sections included the Shengxin, Tianbai, Huangze, and Yongjia sections of the Zhejiang-Fujian Line. The Zhejiang-Anhui Secondary Line and Basic Line were under construction, and the Lancang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line had been surveyed. Roads contracted by merchants included the Hangyu, Yulin, Yuwu, Hangfu, Hanghai, Pinghu-Shuanglin, Ningchang, Shengxin-Shaocao, and Sheng lines. The outbreak of military conflicts affected all roads, leading to disrepair, vehicle damage, and a decline in business. Ongoing construction on various lines came to a standstill. In its initial stage, the Construction Department took over amidst widespread devastation and strived to restore order. It assigned specialists to investigate the condition of various roads as a basis for rectification and proposed converting the tobacco tax into a tobacco monopoly to increase revenue. When tobacco tax revenues were nationalized, construction funds suddenly became strained. However, road construction could not be delayed. Therefore, the department prioritized the Basic Ning-Feng Road and the Shaoxing connecting line, and began planning a province-wide road network. When the additional construction tax for each county was established, it was designated as road construction funding. The Provincial Road Bureau was reorganized into the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau to formalize its name and issued highway bonds to meet urgent needs, which led to a gradual expansion of open roads and the completion of unfinished lines. Road surveying and construction began to progress actively. Merchants continued to contract roads, and the Ningyuan, Changyu, Shengchang, and Hangxian routes have all opened to traffic successively. Companies still in operation include the Quguang, Ningde, and Yuxiaoan companies. As of 1929, the total length of completed roads in the province was 784.74 kilometers. Publicly funded roads accounted for 438.64 kilometers, or 55.90%, while privately funded roads accounted for 346.10 kilometers, or 44.10%. Roads operating passenger vehicle services accounted for 555.29 kilometers, or 70.76%. According to historical road construction statistics, merchant-built roads were most developed in 1926, totaling 130.42 kilometers. Publicly funded road construction peaked in 1929, totaling 249.38 kilometers (excluding recovered merchant-built routes). Comparing road construction achievements over the past six years, 1929 was the most successful, with a total of 296.42 kilometers completed.</p>
<p>Provincial Road Network: The Construction Department, recognizing the somewhat rudimentary development of existing roads, pre-established a provincial road network to ensure uniform road administration and prevent future conflicts and duplication. It selected ten major trunk lines, totaling 2,795 kilometers, and forty branch lines, totaling 3,953 kilometers, for a grand total of 6,748 kilometers. This plan has been approved by the Provincial Government Committee at its 224th meeting. Once fully completed, a network of highways will extend throughout the province. The planned road network comprises over 6,700 kilometers, of which approximately one-tenth has already been constructed. Many other sections are underway or planned for completion within five years, and some are even planned for conversion into railways. Previously established and unfinished roads, as well as planned railway lines, along with the original road network, include six north-south trunk lines, three east-west trunk lines, and one coastal line, totaling 2,795 li. There are forty branch lines, totaling 3,953 li. The second north-south trunk line is now planned for conversion into the Xiaoshan-Jinhua railway. The Jinpu line, the second east-west trunk line, will be converted into the Lishui-Longquan railway. The Puan branch line and the Jianwei line will be converted into the Jiande-Weiping railway.</p>
<p>Highway Bureau Operations: The former road administration agency in this province was the Zhejiang Provincial Road Bureau, directly under the highest provincial administrative official. The bureau included an engineering department and administrative, business, and financial sections, each responsible for various tasks. During road construction, district engineering offices were established. Once sections were completed, management offices were established. The bureau chief and deputy bureau chief were appointed by the governor, while other staff were appointed by the bureau chief. With the establishment of the Construction Department, the Provincial Road Bureau was placed under its jurisdiction and underwent a reorganization. The bureau chief, deputy bureau chief, and chief engineer were all appointed by the provincial government. In April 1928, the Provincial Road Bureau was renamed the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau, and its organizational regulations were slightly revised. Due to the urgency of construction on the Hangchang, Hangxian, Hangshi-Hangchang, Lancang, and Yongli lines, the provincial government issued organizational regulations for the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau engineering offices to ensure compliance. Each district engineering office was staffed with an engineer to manage all engineering within the district. Districts were further divided into sections, each managed by an assistant engineer. In August 1928, the Gongsan section of the Hangshao Road, the basic line, was completed and opened to traffic. New projects on various roads were also actively underway. Due to the heavy workload, the Highway Bureau's organization had to be expanded. Therefore, in November 1928, the regulations for the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau were submitted and approved by the provincial government. The differences from the original organization included the appointment of a chief engineer concurrently serving as the head of the engineering department, and a chief of machinery concurrently serving as the head of the vehicle department, both appointed by the provincial government. The original business section was merged into the vehicle department. The organization of the district engineering offices was also revised by the provincial government to allow for the rapid and separate construction of highways, resulting in the Zhejiang Highway Bureau District Engineering Office Organizational Regulations. Districts were divided into sections, each 50 to 60 li in length, and sections were further divided into subsections, each limited to 20 li. Each district was headed by a chief engineer. By the end of 1929, in addition to Gongsan, the Shaoxing connecting line, Ningfeng Road, Hangchang Road, and Hangping Road had been completed in succession, totaling 255.60 kilometers.</p>
<p>Privately Funded Roads: The earliest privately funded highway project in Zhejiang was the Hangyu Highway, proposed in 1922, followed by the Yulin, Yuwu, Hangfu (recovered by the province), Hanghai, Pinghu-Shuanglin, and Ningchang companies. The Shengxin section of the publicly funded Zhejiang-Fujian Line was also leased to a merchant-organized company for operation. Subsequently, the Shengsan, Jicaosheng, Ningyuan, Shengchang, Yuxiaoan, and Ningde roads were also initiated. To date, the Changyu, Hangping, and Qukang routes have also been organized. Therefore, there are a total of sixteen privately funded companies, with a total capital of 4,060,000 yuan in national currency. The largest capital was allocated to Jicaosheng, totaling 1,000,000 yuan in national currency, followed by Qukang at 600,000 yuan, Changyu at 400,000 yuan, Hanghai and Yulin both at 350,000 yuan, Shengchang at 320,000 yuan, and Hangyu and Yuwu both at 250,000 yuan. The trunk and branch lines of these privately funded highways total 96.31 kilometers, with 346.10 kilometers already constructed, 87.12 kilometers under construction, and 101.68 kilometers planned.</p>
<p>Number of Vehicles: The Hangshao Road has the most vehicles. The Xiaoshao Road has 65 vehicles, the Gongsan Road has 23 vehicles, the Hangyu Road has 31 vehicles, the Hangchang Road has 29 vehicles, the Hanghai Road has 28 vehicles, and the Shaocaosheng Road has 27 vehicles. For passenger vehicles, excluding the Gongsan section of the Hangshao Road, which also operates on city streets and thus has a particularly high number, the Hangshao Road and Xiaoshao Road have the highest number, with 94.5 vehicles, followed by the Hangyu Road with 63.6 vehicles, and the Shaocaosheng Road with 54.6 vehicles. The Ningyuan Road has the lowest number with 9 vehicles, and the Changyu Road with 7.2 vehicles. For small chartered cars, the Shaocaosheng Road has the highest number with 24.5 vehicles, followed by the Hangshao Road and Hangyu Road with 23.1 vehicles each, the Shengchang Road with 17 vehicles, the Hangxi Road with 16.1 vehicles, and Yuwu with 14.4 vehicles. By category, there are 293 vehicles for business purposes and 32 vehicles for operational and official purposes. Among the vehicles for business purposes, passenger vehicles are the most numerous, with 211 ordinary passenger vehicles and 71 small chartered cars, totaling 282 vehicles. This indicates that all highways in the province are primarily focused on passenger transport, with only the Changyu and Pinghu-Shuanglin roads generating significant revenue.</p>
<p>Construction of Various Roads: Highway construction should primarily meet the needs of modern transportation. Engineering facilities must align with broad, flat, and straight conditions to ensure driving safety, passenger trust, and business development. If the roadbed is narrow, the slope is steep, the curvature is sharp, and the road surface is uneven, vehicles will experience bumps and vibrations, causing discomfort to passengers. Excessive shaking can damage parts, and vehicles may even overturn, endangering passengers' lives. Zhejiang Province follows the requirements of the Ministry of Railways for highway engineering and also has its own regulations. The minimum radius of curves is 16 meters, and the maximum slope is set at 4%. In unavoidable circumstances, it can be increased to 8%. The narrowest road surface width is 4.5 meters, and the widest is 7 meters.</p>

<p>Qiong Bo, an important member of a major American circus, relies on General Motors trucks to transport equipment between states for performances. General Motors trucks are produced by the American General Motors Manufacturing Plant. The truck bodies are exceptionally large, with sufficient load capacity, comfortable stability, and speed, while also being economical. General Motors trucks are used in various countries around the world, and are now trusted in various regions of China. They are indeed unique trucks.</p>

<p>— Heping</p>
<p>The Anhui Highway Department is directly under the Construction Department, with the department director, Li Fanyi, concurrently serving as the head of the department. Currently, three sections of highways in the province are open to traffic: the Anqian Road from Anqing to Qianshan, totaling 92 kilometers; the Jingwu Road from Wuhu to Dangtu, totaling 28 kilometers; and the Hechao Road from Hefei to Chaoxian, totaling 72 kilometers. There are a total of 42 long-distance buses for passenger and freight transport. From September of last year to June of this year, the business revenue and expenditures could not offset each other due to the initial startup period, resulting in a total loss of over 33,000 yuan. Starting in July of this year, efforts have been made to rectify the situation by increasing revenue and reducing expenditures. Despite the impact of rising gasoline prices, there is still a monthly surplus, and the future is very optimistic. However, at the beginning of July, the Transportation Department of the General Headquarters issued an order to requisition 16 trucks for a military-use heavy vehicle committee for the war zone, which has caused transportation difficulties. Now that the autumn harvest is plentiful, and the transport of rice and grains relies on automobiles, Director Li has decided to purchase an additional ten vehicles. Representatives from the Shanghai Ford Motor Company, Yu Tengfang and Li Jiashi, as well as the deputy manager of General Motors, Tao Fu, and Yan Jiqing, have successively arrived in Anhui to discuss the matter. It is expected that a decision will be made soon, and the new vehicles will be delivered.</p>

<p>— Ying</p>
<p>According to news from 者靈, the Five-Two-Five Flying Star new car has won a gold cup awarded by the Persian Automobile Association, of considerable value. It is the most valuable prize awarded by the association in all its competitions since its establishment. The Persian National Automobile Competition, organized by the Automobile Association, commenced on June 22nd and lasted for eight days until June 29th. The competition consisted of eight events, all difficult journeys, covering a total distance of 3,100 kilometers, equivalent to 1,926 miles. The competition generated unprecedented excitement, attracting great attention from people all over Europe. Many individuals participated in the competition, with almost every car manufacturer from around the world participating. The competition rules were particularly strict, not only emphasizing the speed of travel and the durability of the components, but also including a two-kilometer speed test and a three-kilometer hill climb. Braking and acceleration were also tested in separate segments. All vehicles had to complete all the competition events to be eligible to win. It is evident that the hope of winning the championship was exceedingly difficult. During the race, there were strict secret parking regulations, and water was not allowed to be added to the radiator during the race. Under these circumstances, the Five-Two-Five Flying Star factory car "5252S" GiatTourere driven by Rahnenfeld was able to win the championship, ranking first. All the famous cars from various manufacturers were defeated, and its excellent performance was truly astonishing. It is said that the price of this new car ranges from 1,500 to 3,000 gold yuan, which is not expensive. At the same time, Rahnenfeld, the driver, also won the 1930 Persian Automobile Association's National Competition Medal.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Simplify Traffic Lights and Street Signs <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Jiren</p>
<p>Traffic lights installed at intersections are convenient for traffic and ensure public safety. To be effective, the traffic lights must be clearly visible and the signs must be simple, easy to distinguish, and understand. The American Engineering Bureau recently investigated the conditions of street signs, traffic lights, and markings in over one hundred large cities (each with a population of approximately 50,000). The following is a brief summary based on a report from the news agency of the American General Motors Manufacturing Plant.</p>
<p>Accurate markings are of great help to drivers, and are even more important for traffic management in bustling cities. Street numbers should be simple and their location should be conspicuous. For example, the wording should be clear, the colors should be standard, the format should be consistent, and the location should be appropriate. All of these factors must be carefully considered. Unauthorized posters and miscellaneous signs should be prohibited and removed from intersections.</p>
<p>No matter how clear street numbers are, if they are not earnestly implemented and there is no unified system, the result will be a failure. Other street numbers will inevitably be affected, rendering them ineffective.</p>
<p>According to the report, the materials used to make street signs should also be carefully selected. Wrought iron sheets, steel plates, or wood can be used, coated with enamel for aesthetics, durability, and reasonable cost.</p>
<p>All street numbers must be bright day and night. At night, they should be illuminated with lights. There are many methods, but the most effective is to suspend electric lights in front of the street signs or use transparent and reflective lights, depending on local conditions.</p>

<p>— Pingping</p>
<p>The progress of automobile transportation is already very evident. According to last year's statistics, the number of registered automobiles, excluding the United States, has increased by 16.5%. Looking at the world, there are only four countries with over one million automobiles. In total, there are 32,000,000 passenger cars, freight cars, and large four-wheeled vehicles in use around the world today.</p>
<p>The Solomon Islands in the South Pacific has the least developed automobile industry, with only two vehicles to date. Excluding the United States, New Zealand has the most, with approximately one vehicle for every 8.9 people. Canada is third, with one vehicle for every nine people.</p>
<p>The United States has 77% of the world's motorized vehicles and produces 83.5% of them. Last year, European automobile companies also produced 600,000 automobiles and freight cars.</p>
<p>Five Countries Investigate Road Administration</p>
<p>The improvement of automobile transportation around the world is also evidenced by the recent fact that five representatives of leading enterprises have visited the United States to investigate best practices in road construction and passenger vehicle development.</p>
<p>Dr. Ang Labian, an employee of the Philippine Luzon Railway Company, is studying the operation of long-distance buses and the state of train and automobile traffic in the United States.</p>
<p>Mr. O'Huait of Germany is investigating American automobile tax rates and road finance as a reference for improving German taxation and road systems. Austrian road official William Bock is currently seeking evidence of all concrete and effective road construction methods. Two directors and</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>Two engineers from the Tokyo Ishikawa Company of Japan are also carefully examining the use of Ishikawa's method of automobile adoption in the United States.</p>
<p>The former president of the Finnish Automobile Brokers Association and current transportation advisor to the Finnish Ministry, Mr. Chugola, reported to his countrymen the importance of road construction and requested the government to raise foreign debt to rectify all roads and complete unfinished projects. He is currently investigating road administration in the United States.</p>
<p>Extensive Road Construction in South America</p>
<p>"South American countries are sparing no effort in road construction. Although financial management and academics are all important issues, the government's efforts to build more roads to benefit the people are indeed urgent." This is a statement made by Mr. Aiqumi, the vice president of a regular automobile company, representing the United States at the Second Pan-American Road Congress in Rio de Janeiro. Mr. Mi also reported that while traveling, he could casually see groups of automobiles speeding along the roads. He recalled that four years ago, it was difficult to travel outside the city due to inconvenient transportation, but now it is very different, and even deep in the mountains and forests, it is possible to drive.</p>
<p>Points of View Vary with Time</p>
<p>When President Theodore Roosevelt of the United States inspected Michigan in 1909, someone described the usefulness of automobiles and requested a test ride, but his guards considered this to be a risky move and advised against it.</p>
<p>"An accident may occur, and the horses pulling the carriages will be frightened by an automobile."</p>
<p>For this reason, President Roosevelt initially hesitated before taking a seat in the automobile.</p>
<p>China Strives for Construction</p>
<p>Today, China has over 30,000 miles of roads that can be used by automobiles, and another 3,764 miles are under construction. Muddy ground is also gradually being paved into roads. Of the eighteen provinces, Guangdong and Henan have the most paved roads. The automobile route between Shanghai and Beijing is increasing daily, as is the case in central China and Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>In 1922, Fujian Province had only three automobiles. Today, the province has 300 buses operating on perfectly constructed roads. The first highway between Fuzhou and the port city of Xiamen can be considered one of the most modern in the country. As for the construction of inland roads, it is proceeding without rest.</p>
<p>New Roads in Spain</p>
<p>Spain is currently constructing a modern, high-speed road from Madrid to San Pei Xing, with a length of 260 miles and a width of approximately 36 feet (6 feet for parking). The turns are wider to accommodate the accumulation of goods. When other roads meet this road, they will be higher or slightly lower. In recent years, Spain's roads have progressed rapidly. The highway between Baus Luna and the French border has now been completed, making transportation for travelers extremely convenient. Other roads, although not as wide or good as the new roads, are also flat and beautiful.</p>
<p>Chilean Expert Goes to Peru</p>
<p>The President of Chile sent a letter to the President of Peru, stating that three automobile experts from his country have recently arrived in Lima to complete the automobile highway between Santiago (Chile) and Lima (Peru). The distance between the two cities is 1,800 miles, and once the road is completed, the destination can be reached in 35 days.</p>
<p>Service Becomes Increasingly Widespread</p>
<p>One thing can prove that automobile service is ubiquitous and widespread. When travelers were traveling through the high mountains of Norway, the support of their Chevrolet car broke. They made a long-distance phone call to the town of Lali Hammer, only three thousand people, one hundred miles away. Informing the local automobile manager to come and repair it. The next day, a technician and an assistant did come. Finally, the brake was installed and restored to its original state. Four hours later, its Class A was able to resume its joyful life.</p>
<p>Hungary Pays Attention to First Aid</p>
<p>The automobile industry in Hungary is becoming increasingly important, so the Ministry of Interior has notified all drivers across the country that whenever an accident occurs, they must stop their vehicles and do their best to provide rescue. After the decree was issued, the Royal Automobile Club hired famous doctors to teach its members various first aid and treatment methods.</p>
<p>Hungarian reports said that the country's automobile companies have organized a mutual aid society. They help each other in times of danger. The government praised it. According to a recent survey, there are 18,741 automobiles in the country.</p>
<p>South African Summit Through Traffic</p>
<p>We have seen many times that cars can drive on the top of the mountain. Twenty-five years ago, someone investigated the total number of vehicles in the world. In South Africa, it was found that the Cape Corner was suitable for paving roads for vehicles. It is currently under construction and will be completed soon.</p>
<p>Drivers Like to Doze Off</p>
<p>An American automobile exporting company said that there is a very strange resistance to overseas sales. That is, coachmen are reluctant to switch to driving cars. When driving a car, there is no good chance to take a nap. In other words, when the coachman is pulling a heavy load, he can sit high and sleep peacefully.</p>
<p>French Ban Private Transfers</p>
<p>For example, a product produced in November 1929, claimed to be a 1930 automobile, was treated as a false statement in the Paris court and was subject to punishment. In short, when selling a car, private transfer dates are not allowed. The date of departure of the goods from the factory is the statutory standard time.</p>
<p>Familiar Things Hidden</p>
<p>The German Postal Service Headquarters issued an order to various places to improve management. From August 1, the practice of postmen walking door-to-door to deliver letters in the countryside of Hesse Province has become a thing of the past. Specially made new cars are equipped with four seats, a room for storing letters). Special service for rural delivery is required. Passenger cars have also been increased from once a day to twice a day.</p>
<p>Four Hundred Vehicles in Two Hours</p>
<p>In 1909, the average monthly production of automobile factories was at most 400 vehicles. However, progress was very rapid. Today, the Oakland Bonxia Factory can manufacture that number (400 vehicles) every two hours.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Records</p>
<h3 id="e234">Buick's African Hunting Expedition <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Using automobiles for hunting in the African wilderness is truly an unprecedented feat. This year, an American named Beidu Shi, full of whimsy, hired twenty people. He personally drove a Buick touring car, along with six additional freight trucks. They departed from French Touraine in Africa, passing through Kaiye—Sudan—Equatorial Central Africa—Nagaria—the Sahara Desert—and finally arriving in Morocco. The journey spanned 9,500 miles and lasted five months. Mr. Bei's Buick performed exceptionally well during this long journey, with very satisfactory results. This hunting trip yielded several lions and numerous hippos, all rare and valuable trophies. The route passed through deep forests and vast swamps, and the car's speed varied depending on the road surface. It reached speeds of up to forty miles per hour at times, and as slow as ten miles per hour at others. When encountering rivers and swamps, they used canoes to ferry the vehicles across. The hunting areas were all places untouched by white men. Africa's tropical climate was overwhelmingly hot, so Mr. Bei adjusted his activities to the nighttime. One day, while dining under the trees, wild bees detected the aroma and arrived in swarms of thousands, causing great distress to Mr. Bei. Fortunately, he cut open a lemon to lure the bees away. His companions were all afraid of the bees, but Mr. Bei alone, wearing gloves and a mask, moved among them. Later, upon reaching a central station, they encountered a sleeping sickness epidemic. Mr. Bei and his party took quinine and were spared. Later, upon arriving in French Africa, they encountered road construction, which allowed for relatively fast travel. In Nagaria, Africa, there was a highway six hundred miles long, as flat and straight as could be. The car traveled on this road with unparalleled comfort. But soon the joy ended and hardship began, as crossing Nagaria meant entering the Sahara Desert. The desert was filled with yellow sand, and the road was long and arduous. In the past, driving cars in the desert required special caterpillar track attachments. Mr. Bei, trusting in the Buick's resilience, prepared 700 liters of fresh water in advance. He drove day and night. The desert is unpredictable, shifting with the wind. Driving a car through it was even more difficult than groping through a deep forest in the dark. Thankfully, the desert was quite cool at night, and the car advanced by the light of its headlights, finally reaching the plains. Mr. Bei's journey can be described as a groundbreaking achievement, traversing Africa from west to east. The Buick deserves the greatest credit. Along the way, there was only one minor repair. Afterward, Mr. Bei's Buick, after being washed, looked as good as new.</p>
