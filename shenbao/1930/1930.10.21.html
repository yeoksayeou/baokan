<h3 id="c9">世界物質進化與人類幸福 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>自近今以前。世界物質愈進化。則人類之幸福愈。增加。至於近日。則似有不盡然者。物質之進化。視前有增無减。航空界之彼此競爭。幾有一日千里之勢。而其餘機械化學等等。亦日有發明。即如昨電所云。火車之大革命。其速率之增加。每小時能有兩倍百八十公里之鉅。其進步有非人料所及者。然而返觀世界人類之生活。無一不受商業衰落之困苦。失業日多。不滿於政治。而起而反抗政府者。日有所聞。而各國之政治家類束手無策。此其故何哉。豈物質之進化無益於人類。盛極而必衰歟。抑所謂物質進化者。競趨於爭利之一途。而致有此因利而受弊也。</p>
<p>蓋物質進步。原爲便利人類之故。而生需要。因需要而始獲利。今因能獲利者進步不已。而未能獲利者。則棄而不顧故今世之物質進步。乃偏倚而非普遍之進步。利之所在則皆趨。故卒至可以獲利物質。供過於求而自招失利。因失利而人類幸福反受其害。是近今人類幸福之不能滿意。非物質進步之罪。羣趨於獲利一途之咎。也</p>

<p>— 硯叟</p>
<p>北平十一日專電。有自石莊來者云。閻錫山在獲鹿。已挖地洞洞通三門。上有氣管。洞上面覆以枯草。俾與平地一色。余謂此彷彿寒露以後之蟋蟀也蟋蟀畏寒。乃在地中打洞。洞亦有兩三口。旣可避寒。又通空氣。亦便出入。其洞口。又往往掩覆在枯草之下。且蟋蟀喜鬥。鬥而敗。逃入洞中不敢出。今日之閻。極相似也。</p>
<p>又電。閻向汪云。如兩星期内。不能維持。吾等結伴出洋。並謂君與陳（公博）鄒謝覃茅。係予請來者。出洋費用。矛完全負責。陳公博主張備好飛機。必要時。飛至庫倫。轉道海參　。搭輪赴法。余謂此又彷佛秋分後之燕子。結伴飛向海上而去。燕子銜泥辛苦。築成巢壘。惜乎時機一　過。雖欲戀戀於此。而勢有不能者。回思雙棲玳瑁之梁。呢喃對語。何其樂也。一旦怱促遠飛。能無今昔不同之感。今日閻汪陳諸人。不免夫婦雙雙。同上飛機。以海外爲託身之所。與﨎棲玳梁之秋燕。辭故壘而飛向海上。不又相似乎。</p>
<p>硯叟戲贈以句云。秋分寒露節。相逼亦太甚。蟋蟀蟄洞中。可憐入陷穽。燕子飛海上。呢喃亦口噤。人類與物類。彼此可借鏡。不放屠坦刀。終失太阿柄。倘亦悔當初。惜哉不及諍。</p>
<h3 id="c181">談日本米 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>日本爲遠東之工業國。農產不多。人民之米糧。大都仰諸他國之運往。此次忽有大批日本米運往各國銷售。我人聞之、得不爲之駭異乎。以事實而言。日本有餘剩之米。運往他國。在歷史上。亦係第一次。此次日本所以有餘米出售。其重大之原因有二。一方因歷年爲維持米價起見。積米過多。而一方則因本年農產豐收。所得新米。倍於往年。故日本當局。在此情形之下。便决將餘米運往國外設法銷售。照預定計劃。運往之地。計有中國。荷屬東印度。近東各國。英國。德國等。自此種消息傳出以後。日本營進出口之米商。咸紛紛前往。自願包運云。</p>
<p>且此次日商運米時。尙有種種有利條件。蓋此種日本米。運往各國。能否銷售。事前實難確定。故當局方面。曾允米商如有損失。概歸政府負擔。此次日米運出之目的。在求維持國内之米價。而一方則在保護農人之利益。蓋米數一多。價必低落。可見日政府近來對於農業方面。竭力獎勵也。日本米之銷路。大概以爪哇爲最多。年可二·○○○擔。至於仰給於荷屬東印度者則有四·○○○·○○○擔矣。日本政府。現已决擬加高進口稅則。以抵制米糧之進口。此事對於在日本營米糧進口業者。大有影響焉。</p>
<p>關於英國方面。所運之米。種種手續。目前已完全確定。而日本政府此次所運出之米糧。内中大都爲積穀倉内多年之陳米。運往各國。其所售之價。並無一定之標準。唯一目的。在根據各國市價。力求平衡。至於所受損失。不拘大小。均可勿顧。故結果政府方面。必蒙重大之損失。日本政府。目前所有陳米。計有二·六○○·○○２○擔。而此次出口者。則預定三·○○○·○○○擔。所有陳米。佔十分之八。其品質之低劣。可想而知。以日本米之出口而言。第一次在一九一四年。僅一三○·○○○擔。最後一次。爲一九二八年。數僅五○○·○○○擔。且爲商人私運。而其中大都爲囤積之外國米。故此次運出者。爲數之多。實爲從來所未有。而内中亦並非純粹爲日本米也。</p>

<p>余近偕老妻挈孫女。游桐廬。泛舟七里瀧。登嚴子陵鈞臺。老興不淺。歸程過滬。逢同鄉瞿程二君。邀到大舞臺。觀艶秋演劇。是夕演虹覓關武家坡雙齣。表情細膩。配角王少樓。芙蓉草。亦不弱。觀衆自有定評。見臺前懸掛聯額頗多。有友盛稱艶秋貌美。遍觀羣聯。都可通用。倩余作聯。須確切男性。而明嵌艶秋兩字。余略一凝思。便應曰可。蓋憶及二十六年前。在東灜。識一藝妓名秋子。貌亦甚美。乃口占一聯以告之曰。悔帶艶妻來。恐其一見傾心。從此厭我。追懷秋子美。悟出兩人異性。豈獨思他。余妻年已六十。何足以當艶妻。不知詩云艶妻。並不指年輕貌美。而主在能煽。則老妻何不足以當之。友又指視包廂中懸額。有一幅書無旦不程腔五字。最好。余遞觀其右。兩額皆平庸。再右。卻有四字極切當。此四字高貼墻上。曰偏正頭痛。可解作觀客坐正廳而稍偏。便腦筋不舒而頭痛也。質諸觀衆。以爲然否。（却酬）</p>

<p>— 陳伯英</p>
<p>天寗寺。江南大叢林之一也。寺在常州東門外。佔地數百畝。僧衆千餘人。入其寺。數日不能盡歷。問寺内有屋幾間。或謂有一藏數。雖誇誕。亦無人知其確數也。寺内設百貨之肆。諸物皆不待外求。其煑飯之鑊。以銅鑄之。深可容一人立。蓋則自梁間繫繩。用轆轤上下之。其正殿。高峻甚。仰望若無頂。佛像亦偉大無倫。相傳殿脊有葫蘆。爲淨銅所鑄。能使兩里内不受風霾侵。寺中宿富有。白龍山有盜江五者。向寺僧借銀。僧不可。江五曰。三日内必取若葫蘆去。若勿悔。江五旣去。寺中僧多。固有具好身手者。日伺之。至第三日。若飛鳥過。則葫蘆失矣。僧羣起追之。至數里外。僅有二僧相及。即與鬭。無勝負。江五旣疲。乃棄其葫蘆於江中。二僧慚。亦不復返。今寺中尙多能技擊者。而香積廚頭陀爲最。寺中製藥酒出售。愈瘋疾。頗騐。</p>

<p>— 汪亞塵</p>
<p>此次余爲考察意大利全國之新舊美術。於四月下旬從瑞士先到米朗Milano。觀西文Vinoi名作「最後之晚餐。」復由米朗至佛羅稜司。再由佛羅稜司經各名勝而旋扺羅馬。在羅馬兩旬。連日暢遊。歷史上遺蹟之多。實爲世界之冠。古代羅馬。藝術昌明。已達極點。歐洲各名國文化。雖發源於希臘。但最早即移植於羅馬。成古羅馬石造建築的一大特色。至於宗敎藝術。可說皆由羅馬產生。到了十五世紀文藝復興期。尤有特殊的光榮。故今日留下的遺蹟。實使吾人探求於無盡。茲將關於羅馬之古蹟。簡記於下。</p>
<p>（一）聖保羅St,Paul敎堂　羅馬有敎堂三百餘所。其最大者。即聖彼得與聖保羅二所。此堂建築宏大。在遠處即能望見其頂。敎堂外有一大嚝場。場之周圍有大理石柱百二十根。此堂六十年前曾毁於火。火後重建。完成至今。已五十年矣。堂内全用彩色大理石嵌成。有穆閘依克Mosaic用顏色小方塊大理石所嵌出之圖案美術品甚多。敎堂陳列之宗敎畫。用拉飛爾之名作嵌成穆閘依克。與原畫色彩無異。嵌工之精。無與倫比。敎堂正廳圚頂及四周。亦都用細石嵌工。并嵌出歷來各大敎士像。其中有座聖保羅像之眼珠。以金鋼鑽點出。抬頭望去。其光四射。據知者云。儘堂内所裝置之窗。用去十八兆里拉。（意錢名每里拉合中幣一角四分）窗間以五彩大理石琢成薄片。代替玻璃。石薄遇光線。發半透明。石紋畢露。利用石紋之自然圖案。每塊花紋不一。當時爲取此窗之花紋。用去大理石。不可數計。羅馬敎堂建築。不惜工本。只求精美。故敎堂内所陳設之物。無一不是寳貴之美術品。</p>

<p>第十五回　四廂彈涙惆悵紅情　一座傾心低徊綠意</p>
<p>且說左詩晨在翠筠妝閣。持螯對菊。正聽翠筠講伊的小姊妹洪蓮香嫁人後悲慘的歷史。要知道一件事的究竟。連人家來催翠筠的堂唱。他也不讓伊走。說把這件事的始末講完了。再去出堂唱也不爲遲。你倘是要緊。講的簡單些好了。偏偏那位翠筠三小姐。善於叙事。伊講一件事。一定要從頭講起。不肯漏落一節。人家說。「燒破了一件布衫。要從種棉花講起。」那位翠筠姑娘。大有此風。現在正談到那位殷太太。趁着老爺不在家中。便盤問這個馬車夫根生。伊想根生是老爺最切近的人。老爺到那裏。根生也到那裏。再也不會差的。所謂探驪得珠。他前天在無意之中。漏出了大太太之字。便是最大的一個漏洞。當時便被我捉住了問他。他雖然嘴裏强辯。却已臉漲通紅。可見已是在那裏虚心。好比磨勘卷子一般。要慢慢兒磨勘出毛病來的。忙不在一時。追問得急了。恐怕生變。所以伊當時放過一門。過了三四天後。老爺眞個是出門了。老爺一出門。根生便閑空了不少。因此太太便呌他進來。平心靜氣的研訊一回。做文章似的先把他虚冒一下。倘然這個法子不好。另外用别個法子。誰知根生到底是個粗人。被殷太太一冒。就冒出來了。他心中還埋怨他的老爺。怎麽這樣老實。自已敎人不要說穿。他自已却去告訴了太太。其實根生自已上了當。說出三太太是没有。髣髴承認二太太是有的。他還以爲自已比老爺聰明咧。殷太太見這一個冒功。已奏了成效。便再用旁敲側擊的功夫。可歎現在的檢察推事們。没有向殷太太。去遞一個門生帖子。一定可以進益不少。大凡要問一個人的口供。不是粗心浮氣可以問得出的。至於偵探們的刑訊。更是蠻針瞎炙。徒令人多吃苦頭。你若是慢慢兒問。終歸是問得出來的。那天太太又說道。二太太搬到公館裏來的話。老爺已經答應了。大約等老爺回來以後。出月就要實行了。我們倒要騰出一間房間。不知道伊那裏的傢生多不多。太太說到這句話。就想到老爺既然討了小在外面。一定是什麽紅木房間。外國房間。不用說。錢終花得不少。且試試根生的口氣。只要他說出傢生或多或少。就證實一句是買了傢生咧。誰知根生却只答應了幾個是。不接下文。</p>

<p>— 光美</p>
<p>「祖弟、今天是我在外度的第七個中秋了、七年前的今日啊、我還是個怪天眞的孩子、什麽都尚不十分明瞭、無論母親的事情怎樣忙碌、收店賬的摧得如何緊迫、而我、而我都不能且不知去替母親略分担子、依然和你們忙得不亦樂乎的堆菓子、擺玩物、買燈子、裝置着廣寒宮、以饗月姊、迷戀着「在家不進月、出外遭雨雪」的金科玉律、於是爭着洗凈手面、虔誠地拜月、爆竹連響、香烟迷漫、此情此景、你還記得嗎、也就是這個中宵吧、你們都睡了、母親因了日間忙碌過度也早睡了、只有我和大姊未睡、於是我倆未得母親的仝意便冒然地和叔父他們去逛城頭、由南門上、直至北門下、回家時、月已西沉、鞋襪盡被露水浸濕、偏巧母親醒了、問我們從什麽地方來、不知利害的我啊、還得意洋洋地告訴母親、那知母親氣不堪言、就此請我倆吃大菜、「十幾歲的女孩子、那有半夜出去游玩的道理、若是遇到熟人、豈不要駡我太無家敎、」大姊背地怪我太直述不當一五一十地一層底子不留、其實、天啊、我那裏料到她老人家竟會這般大發雷霆、更那裏知道去的不當呢、當時我恨煞母親了、「爲什麽女孩子半夜不可出外玩、」樂極生悲、只好附諸一哭、大姊也是如此、呵、弟弟、那是七年的事情呵、如今呢、如今……往事那堪回首、未來又何能預料、</p>
<p>理智上雖然明知不該再計什麽中秋、可是、這一刻呵、理智却戲勝不過感情、這下意識的劣根性、連自已也莫明其妙、此刻尙在早晨、我便這般想起了、今朝呀、今朝、我將何計度此月夜、」</p>
<p>委實是、太不行了、竟失却了理智般地信手寫出上面的一段、郵寄給弟弟、他不知在作何感想、哭我陳腐呢、抑同樣在思親、</p>
<p>同房間的姊兒們、僅剩我和曄、分外明的月兒、透過窗紗、直射在全房的前半截、爲了愛她不過的緣故、於是把電燈暫熄、曄和我對窗口立着、不期而同地頻頻嘆息、「難過死了、難過死了、」</p>
<p>「我要哭呵、曄、只恨我的洞貴如金、不從心願、」</p>
<p>「我也想哭、哭似乎是痛快的、但辦不到、還是不哭、」</p>
<p>我俩沉默了一會、全房間充滿了游子思親的氤氲、聖潔的月色籠罩在這酸楚的氤氲裹、愈覺悽然、已經失却了靑春並狀氣的蟋蟀、顯然是發出最後的挣扎在斷斷續續地支吾着、有若贊助游子思親之不勝悲、我俩更黯然、</p>
<p>「呵、美麗的月亮、多麽光明呵、今宵、今宵是我在外度的第七個中秋了、仁慈的母親、可愛的弟妹、他們、他們此刻可曾紀得起我嗎、回想七年前的今宵、逛城頭的一幕、那時、那時無知的我、恨煞母親了、如今……」</p>
<p>對房的秀聽了我的聲音、連忙興高　采烈的跑過來、「哈哈、光美又在做新劇了、」我被她這一講、打斷了話頭、同時、更想到人生本來還不就是和演劇差不多麽、可貴的熱淚、意分文不値地𥰡𥰡落下了、</p>
<p>「呵、光美、你哭了、你哭我也要哭、」曄首先察覺了、</p>
<p>「虧得你們哭得出、小囝似地、我是絲毫不難過、想家呢、要麽是想朋友吧、」不同情於我們的秀、更使我們難過、</p>
<p>「想朋友、也不一定要在今宵呵、只有是「人逢佳節倍思親、」没有倍思朋友的道理呀、」曄還這樣笑着和她辯、我是什麽也不願講了、倒在床上暗自咽嗚、</p>
<p>「起來、光美、不許哭、哭是弱者的表現、可恥呀、無爲的靑年、我們設法去賞月吧、千萬勿虚度此良宵呵、」曄顯然是以理智硬克制着感情、</p>
<p>「好了好了、除努力外、還有什麽話說、我們去玩吧、千萬勿辜負良宵、」</p>
<p>我們商量的結果、到砲台灣去、可是不免太單調了、老實講、還有點胆怯、預計到吳淞喊茂去同游、</p>
<p>「你們那兒去、」迎面遇着沈莊兩君這樣問我倆、</p>
<p>「我們隨便、你們呢、」曄和我同聲應着、</p>
<p>「吳淞去好嗎、」</p>
<p>「好極了、我們本來也是這樣想的、」</p>
<p>「好、同行同行、」</p>
<p>害得沈莊兩君在吳淞車站等有半小時、我和曄才將茂約來、當時我對沈莊二君、只是抱歉無旣、口頭上實不足以代表我内心的歉仄於萬一、</p>
<p>砲台灣却非平日可比擬、狹小的道兒、幾水洩不通、男男女女、肩摩踵接、顯然人們對於廢歷中秋猶依戀不舍哩、沿途居户、都陳設着許多應時食物水菓之類、以饗月姊、拇戲的聲音、爆竹聲音、　成一片、廢歷之難以遽廢、可見一斑、</p>
<p>「光美、美光、」一種快活的神氣充滿於淸脆的音腔裹、顯然是女子的喉嚨、我怪喜的、「誰在呌我」、這聲音於我雖很熟悉、但立刻竟猜想不出、定晴一瞧、</p>
<p>「啊、唐、是你嗎、我還没介意哩、你們幾人來的、」我驚喜地緊握着她手、</p>
<p>「光美、」又是於我很熟悉的聲音、唐連忙告我「是李先生、」我快活極了、又遇到案來與我所敬重的老師李天行先生、接着又有鄧同志向我招呼、他們團聚在那伸入黄浦與揚子中間的慶堤大石上、吃東西、大概還有酒吧、盡他們賞月的雅事、</p>
<p>我們向着這條崎嶇凸凹的石路前進、漸漸地前無行人、後無來者、但距燈塔還很遠哩、於是中止下來、略事休息、這廢堤是左擁黄浦、右挾揚子、前達燈塔、黄浦波濤猛湧、揚子却幽靜平寂、宇宙也就是這麽一種象徵啊、黄浦好似勇敢而有品的騎士、揚子好似而柔和甜靜的美女、强有力騎士、把團　的月兒擊成粉碎、只見一道道的金光、燦爛奪目、稍遠、很遠、再遠、直遠到水天莫辦、那好像金色的地毬舖滿了江面、沈君却不時要逗着莊君、「莊、你瞧、水中有幾個月亮、」我們又拎石頭向水中擲、那邊的石頭起碼總有好幾斤重、曄和我却拿出吃乳的力量、說也可愧、石頭還是由他們供給的哩、自已則再也撓不起來、他們的力氣較大、擲下去的石頭大、聲音也就大了、人生的意義也不過是這一回事呵、好比擲下的石頭能夠使水面起着波痕、也就是對於人類有了一點影響、何况我們擲下去的都怦然有聲呢、</p>
<p>時已九點半了、我們開始向後轉、再等走到堤上時、游人已散去殆盡、唐和李先生他們、也不知在什麽時候先我們而去了、且談且行待到車站、已十點半鐘了、我只是担心着茂不知能否趕得及進校、不霎時、吳淞鎭已到、茂就此和我門告别、</p>
<p>天通庵下車後、爲了舍不得這大好的月色、索性安步當車的走到學校、堅潔的月光照滿大地、跳舞廳般平滑的江灣路上、一個行人也没有、只是柏油地面反射出的閃光、亮晶晶照耀着我們、不知是在歡迎呢、抑歡送我們、我快意得向逛說、「江灣路是我們的、你瞧、一個行人都没有、可貴的詩人、這正是你作詩的時候呵、大地已爲你現着堅潔的詩意了、」</p>
<p>抵校時、鐘樓已告訴我們十二點欠一刻、我們是太大意了、但、誠是千載難遇的現象呵、</p>

<p>— 珍</p>
<p>「民族主義的文藝在世界的文獻上是有很深固的根基的、從希臘以到現在、這一段歷史在「民族主義文藝運動宣言」裏叙述得很爲詳明、你自已可以細細地讀去、總之、事實要有根據、民族主義文藝運動並不是漫無根據的、而且是我們！不祇是我們—應該出來做這種運動的、還有一件事實很强有力的證明民族主義文藝運動之急不可緩、就是、據最近世界各國失業人口的調查、美國的失業者五百萬、英國三百萬、日本一百萬、中國呢、便不可以數計了、而比失業更甚、現在連樹皮草根都找不到來吃的民衆、約略一計有八千萬之多、美國的英國的與日本的失業工人不過五百萬、三百萬或一百萬而已、但已經是鬧得烏烟瘴氣給政府苦心焦思在謀救濟的方法了、而中國呢、失業的恐怕是祗有等到没飯吃的時候的來臨、而連樹皮草根都得來吃的恐怕除了等死之外没甚麽希望了吧、如是的苦難、我們不從民族主義上作澈底的救濟以逹到自决的目的又有甚麽方法呢、所以、民族主義運動、拿事實來證明、便就是當前的急務了」</p>
<p>榮的說話如此、所以、他的努力於民族主義文藝運動自是他應該做的事、不過、儘這樣不息地勞苦下去、在他羸弱的身體上是多少會受到妨害的、那我在我的立塲與愛的圈中自不能抛棄我對於他的愛護之誠而不每夜在固定的休息之鐘點中加以婉勸他按時休息了、所以、我一面帮他的忙一面又勸他準時休息、</p>
<p>這眞出乎我的意料之外了、今天下午不到五時榮哥便施施地從辦事室裏回到家來、這時女傭還没有淘米預備燒飯、我生怕他已經經過了整日的疲勞而又要動筆、便央他去吃館子、—央他去新雅吃南洋架厘雞、得他的應許、我們就此到新雅去、</p>
<p>新雅、這所我們廣東的館子原本是我們未結婚之前常常去吃的、榮也常常和他的朋友在那裏飲茶吃點心、而且、有一個時候、榮哥的許多文藝作品都是從那裏產生出來的、據他自已說、新雅對於他有特别的趣味、而他對於新雅的印象極佳、那裏的種種、一切的一切、都使他感覺到非常的滿意、至於我喜歡它當然是它名符其實又新又雅、而又是頂愛吃它的南洋架厘雞、因爲這樣小菜在新雅是特别可口的、别家館子總及不來、不要說家裏譊的是望塵不及了、我們到新雅是五點半鐘差五分、榮不高興上三樓、便在二樓的西廳裏揀了一個座位、一切的對象是我們看慣了的、這回都不期然而然的毫不加以理眯、但是、南面兩張方桌拚成一隻長桌的西端、坐着一個吃客特别使我注意、固然那桌兩旁坐的不祗他一人、還有好幾個、不過他實在太使我注意了、他胖旣胖得好笑、肥肥壯壯一大截好像一條德國大臘腸、紫唐色的臉皮、漲滿了一泡俗氣、兩手把住桌角、一隻還竪起大姆指來、撕開嘴唇、豁露着牙齒、和他的同桌者在談天、說的是廣東話、可是說的是我們廣州人聽不懂的廣東話、一副怪樣子使我估量他是甚麽廣東字號帮的當手、或者是南北雜貨店裏的老闆先生、但榮說他是以寫三角戀愛小說出名的那個廣東人、我不禁笑起來說、「怪不得他那張胖臉子長得没有點兒秀氣」、榮聽了也笑起來、而一簋我們愛吃的南洋架厘雞已然給穿白衣裳的侍者捧到桌面上來了、</p>

<h3 id="c233">靑鐙創刊號 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 高偉</p>
<p>靑鐙社編輯</p>
<p>大光書店總經售</p>
<p>「靑年是時代核心、是社會的泉源、是民族的元氣、這—誰都這樣說、但究竟事實的表現是什麽呢、看吧、靑年旣不能自已覺悟起來負起重大的責任和使命、而來爲一般盲無所從的靑年指示出路的各種刊物、亦同樣缺乏中心意識、同樣可憐、於是處於這種情　之下的靑年、自然而然愈形成一團稽的現象、離人們殷切的期望愈遠了、</p>
<p>我們靑年旣是民族的元氣所注、那末即該爲我們的民族去奮鬥、我們民族正丁於苦難的時代、這責任的仔肩就在我們靑年身上了、靑年將怎樣去解脫民族的苦難的旋渦啊、在不久之前、我們很欣忻的發現了一個「時代靑年」、這張刊物可以說是突起於靑年界的、它的意識就是以民族運動爲中心思想、出版以來大受靑年界歡迎、這也是證明靑年的本身在日趨於覺悟的境域吧、但因此使靑年界的出版物、不覺掀發了熱鬧的現象、最近我們又發現了這份「靑鐙」</p>
<p>在「發刊詞」中、我們可以認識「靑鐙」能態度是這樣、</p>
<p>我們曉得、推動時代的力量、多是靠着時代靑年的努力、說得利害刻切一些、亦可說完全是依靠養靑年、這話、我相信、或不見得怎樣地說得過份、事實擺佈在我們眼前的、何嘗不是如此、所以近今靑年的意志消沉、行動狂妄、接着大多數的民衆、也就意志消沉、行動狂妄、整個民族也就消沉而向下坡走去、造成了目下千鈞一髮的大恐怖時代、</p>
<p>爲了這緣故、他們便不敢再沉默了、他們是要忠誠地爲靑年盡一些棉力、於是就這樣地誔生了「靑鐙」、</p>
<p>我們知道我們的中華民族生了許多缺陷、我們自然就應當積極地想方法去醫治它、灌注民族的意識、燃燒起民族的火把、要實行這個計劃、推源究本、我們更應該從醫治靑年的病熊方面下手、來拯救時代的核心、同人等明知學識能力、兩都淺薄、然而眼見着、一觸即發的危機、憑着我們的内心、我們總覺得應當盡我們的能力、竭我們的識見、豎起靑年的明燈、指示一般徬徨十字街頭的靑年、引向我們　走的康莊大道、</p>
<p>這個責何等地巨大、同時靑年的病症又如此底複雜、我們這小小而微弱的呼喊、引不起時代的激動、驚醒所有執迷不悟的靑年、這自然也是意中事、不過、我們受着内心的驅使、我們覺得非燃起這盞路燈不可、於是乎「靑鐙」就這樣地誔生了、</p>
<p>但—發刊詞是這樣說、在没有看到内容之先、自然還不能貿然深信呢、那末、我們來檢討一下内容再說話吧、</p>
<p>楊紹志的「謹獻給學生團體負責者」是一篇對症下藥的文字、作者首先將過去學生團體負責者的行動加以批評、然後提出他的三點要求、第一、學生治會的職員、要眞正成爲全體學生的公僕、來完成託付者的期望、第二、在思想方面、應樹立正確的意識、指示同學們一條正當的出路、應該爲民族而盡力、第三、在行動方面、要認淸正當的道路、從光明處找出路、唉、各學校學生團體的負責者、請多爲這三點推敲着吧、</p>
<p>陶愚川的「靑年與文藝」、說明靑年與文藝的關係的密切很明澈、末了作者指出我們的文藝是應向着民族自由的大道上前進的、</p>
<p>提起了羅克「不怕死」案件、眞使我們痛心無已、像這樣民族的莫大恥辱、凡是稍有民族感覺的人、都會起來表示反對的、但是這種反對、還是消極的、我們要從積極的方面着手、從事於我們自已的電影、才是這次剌激的好結果、徐希瑜的「從不怕死事件說到民族主義的電影」、就是着重在這方面、而促靑年深省的、我們知道、電影是靠了工業科學藝術三種的合和而發展的、電影在新興藝術的範疇上是第八藝術、在現代、我們在文藝上不單看到民族文藝的史實、而世界民族文藝之進展、更是顯然的事、然而電影上的民族主議的　演則更豐强、尤其在民族藉性方面更表現得淸切了、最近帝</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>主義向弱小民族的　　、却是利用電影、借電影的表現來顯示自已民族的偉大和他民族之卑小、現在「不怕死」正是這樣、所以作者認爲今後的中國電影是該努力於民族主義的電影運動、</p>
<p>此外尙有沈碩文的一中國靑年學生應有的自覺」及湯增　徐則驤的詩等、希碖的「學校生活拾零」不啻是吃口香糖、紹志的小說「戰士的死」、是描寫一個謀印度民族革命的戰士的一幕悲劇、係未完稿、故無從說起、</p>
<p>在大體方面可以說、這本「靑鐙」是還没有什麽大破錠的、如果再努力改進下去、不難成爲靑年界的中心刊物、和「時代靑年」站在同一的立塲上、鼓勵而激發起靑年的民族意識、促靑年完成自身應有的使命、</p>
<h3 id="c234">這園子裡的植物都很美麗 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 高偉</p>
<p>這裏想提出來介紹的、就是務本同學所蒐集的結晶「務本」創刊號、但須預先聲明的、上面的題目是借用了佑湘的「末了一頁」的話、佑湘的意思是謙虚、怕人這樣贊美、就說當不起在先、但在下不免有違了、這、應先請佑湘原諒、</p>
<p>大概女子的作品、總是一番别有風味、並不是武斷、尤其像這樣的作品、委實是研究女子心理學的大好機會、在作品上活躍的、眞彷彿是全個心的暴露、她們的熱血、她們的情緒、她們内心的一切、都赤裸地宣達出來了、因爲在她們的心靈上没有别的觀念的存在、她們有的祗是固有創痕的感懷、或靑春的謳歌、或對於自已未來的期望、即使有所對於社會現實環境表示什麽不滿意、也只是憑着平凡的觀念、並不會有劇烈的衝突、這是生活造成她們這樣的、（不信、可參看就近的「務本、」）所以、這種作品之値得我們玩味、即在使我們認識了一般新時代的女學生在她們的心田上是形成着一個怎樣的輪廓的、雖不能說這些都是她們内心的諧和奏、然而多少是有她們主觀見解的含藴、「我們想哭就哭、我們要笑便笑、在這裏、就有着我們的眼涙、我們的歡笑、我們的夢想、歌唱、我們的憐憫、憤怒與同情、」看了「務本」的「第一頁」的話、不是更可證明了嗎、</p>
<p>在另一方面、女子因多愁善感的因襲、比男子或許會更神經質、她們的傷感的成分、單以「涙」來說、我們看了奇英的「談哭」一篇文字、有說哭是女子的專責的、更是替自已說話了、</p>
<p>這課我想專把文藝方面的談談、一篇恒慮的三幕劇「謟媚、勢利、」是咀咒男子的謟媚勢利、借銀行行員做出氣筒、關於描寫戀愛故事的、包括得的確不在少數、眞是看得起戀愛呵、咀咒禮敎的、有女楨的「和平、」靑禽的「瘋女、」芸的「逆囚、」爾的「黄昏、」駱美雲的「蜜司C」若蓮的「一封信」等、我們可以認識了在禮敎下掙扎着的女子呵、唉、禮敎眞是靑年的大對頭吧、阿留的「過去」描寫師生戀愛、把敎師的一副餓相裝得欲哭不能欲笑不得、女楨的「比現在更小的時光」描寫那沉醉在愛時的情境、那心理的確比男子描寫的朋澈、此外尚有幾篇是描寫戀愛的悲劇的、亦云的「寢室裏的淸風、」使我們看了會笑不可仰、眞感謝這位小姐把生活的片斷揭發出來、這是寫在睡前的春的談話、我們可知道一般女子對愛的見解、在她們的心里上是留下了一個怎樣的印象、品三的「飾、」完全是暴露男性的虚僞、暗示目下一般男靑年不惜爲求歡女子去漂亮、自已用了别人帮助的錢、而對於女子的應酬卻是擺足架子、西裝、化妝物、</p>
<p>其他、在補白中、也有很多是刻薄男子的、同時也附帶表示自已的眞情的、如落英的一二三頁的補白「天下女子皆禍水也、」假使認爲這話是「對的」的男子、那末儘可不視近女子呢、」</p>
<p>至於訴說内心悲哀的則也不少、如萍的「涙」和「生的悲哀、」爽性大嘆其「生活眞悲哀呀、生活眞悲哀呀、」了、品三的那燈下也是一片苦情、對靑春消逝的悽傷、眞是涙多得來、其次、感懷靑春之煩惱的也復不少、這裏舉補白的例來說、因爲我以爲補白更是眞切、二一八頁女楨說、「如此的生活未免太使我孤獨、你呌我怎能不哭、天啊、旣予了我靑春、爲什麽又給我寂寞、」哦呀、情熱極矣、</p>
<p>這裏有幾篇寫得很有意思、而且文字也很精美的、如志霄的「白雲」萍的「血」益宜的「鄕」、右相的「弦音、」但不想把來一一介紹了、恐怕太拿篇幅占了去、</p>
<p>所以總觀起來、這本「務本、」如能灌注以正確中心思想、眞不難成爲民族的優秀份子呢、不過、我希望「務本」的同學以後最好要免除「想哭就哭、要笑就笑、」的態度、固然這樣正顯出你們心田的純潔、但是要知道、文藝作品並不能單憑着個人的意識去狂放一回的、在目前的時代急流中、一方面不能忘掉女子自身解放的要求、一方面尤不能忘掉對於民族國家的責任、唉、我們不要太顧了自身的欲求呵、我們要爲我們的民族創造光明的大道、我們便不能獨個高居在「象牙之塔」裏的啊、</p>

<h3 id="e9">The World's Material Evolution and Human Happiness <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Before recent times, the more the world's material evolved, the more human happiness increased. As for recent times, it seems that this is not entirely true. The evolution of matter continues to increase unabated. The competition between aviation circles is almost advancing at a thousand miles a day, and other mechanization, chemistry, etc. also have daily inventions. For example, as yesterday's telegram said, the great revolution of trains, the increase in its speed can be as much as twice, one hundred and eighty kilometers per hour. Its progress is beyond human expectations. However, looking back at the lives of human beings in the world, none is not suffering from the difficulties of commercial decline. Unemployment is increasing day by day. Dissatisfaction with politics and resistance to the government are heard more and more every day, and politicians in various countries are at a loss. What is the reason for this? Is material evolution useless to mankind? Is it that prosperity must decline? Or is it that the so-called material evolution is competing for profit, resulting in this kind of benefit from profit?</p>
<p>Material progress was originally for the convenience of mankind, and needs arise. Profit is obtained because of needs. Now, because those who can profit continue to progress, those who cannot profit are abandoned. Therefore, the material progress of today's world is biased rather than universal progress. Everyone flocks to where the profit lies, so that the profitable materials are oversupplied, resulting in self-inflicted losses. Because of the losses, human happiness is harmed. Therefore, the dissatisfaction of human happiness in recent times is not the fault of material progress, but the fault of the group flocking to the path of profit.</p>

Alas, sir, you grew up in China, you obtained a high degree early, and your voice shook Yandu. You were grieved by the mountains and rivers, and you have been sinking in the East Hu for a long time. You secretly gathered heroes to restore the plan. In the Xinhai Revolution, Hunan responded to Hubei's call. The uprising of the Three Chu finally drove out the Chanyu. The Republic was successfully established, and you took charge of the military power. The people of Hunan governed Hunan, and the people celebrated the arrival of Su. When the highway usurped the throne, the imperial system entertained itself. Sir, you were unyielding and fled to Wu. The giant bandit was killed, and you repeatedly督湘湖. Unable to bear the悍将, you frequently applied poisonous 痡. You led the Hunan Brigade across the Five Ridges. You assisted our party-state and started the teacher and apprentice. The Ning-Han split, and your tongue was exhausted. Finally, relying on the dry brigade, you rebuilt the universe. Since then, you have been in the center for a long time. The government is lenient, and everyone admires the grand model. How can the Yuan Lao云殂 once be old and in the midst of it? Mourning day and night, the model is in accordance with you. A bunch of autumn fragrance, a cup of pure wine, may your spirit come and enjoy, and bring down blessings and needs. Enjoy, (20th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) After Li Mingzhong arrived in Nanjing, someone asked him, since Li had served as the Minister of Resettlement of the Reorganization Committee, whether it was necessary to hold another meeting on reorganization matters. Li said that soldiers take obedience as their bounden duty. The central government has the full power to dispose of the national army. It should be reorganized if it should be reorganized, and it should be dismissed if it should be dismissed. As for what method to use to implement the reorganization, it is up to the central government to carefully consider the situation and make appropriate plans. Once the policy is determined, the order will be issued, and the prestige will be used to call for it. There is no need for a meeting. In the future, the key points of the method of disbanding the army are: (1) to stop recruiting soldiers, (2) to not fill vacancies. After a certain period of time, the number of troops will naturally be reduced, so that it will be reorganized without reorganization and dismissed without dismissal, and the state's burden on military expenditure can be gradually lightened.

<p>The Public Sentiment for the Nazi Party is Not as Good as Before</p>
<p>Brüning is Praised by All Sides</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 20th - After the Brüning cabinet won over parliamentary resistance this time, British and French public opinion praised it highly. French newspapers claimed that in this vote, the cabinet finally gained the upper hand. Since the National Socialist Party won in the elections, public sentiment could not but be suspicious of the position of Brüning's cabinet. After this vote, the suspicion immediately vanished. Hereafter, it will not be difficult for Brüning to realize his reform plan, and to rescue the Parliament, which is subject to financial difficulties and political disputes, from its chaotic state. The London Daily Telegraph also stated that the National Socialist Party had indeed been pressing people too hard, leading to the disintegration of public sentiment towards it, while the power of the cabinet, on the other hand, had greatly increased in the past week. The Observer reported that, judging from the recent signs of German politics, the concerns that observers had held on behalf of it recently seemed to have no basis at all. According to the above-mentioned newspapers, the tone is actually consistent with the situation in German politics. In the elections in the rural areas of Hamburg, the number of votes for the National Socialist Party has fallen sharply, even one-third less than the number of votes the party has obtained in other areas. Although this type of rural election is not related to the overall situation, it can be inferred from the small to the large that the party's public sentiment is not as good as before.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 19th - Most newspapers stated regarding the results of Saturday's parliamentary meeting that the number of votes the government obtained was beyond the expectations of the optimists and could be described as a significant victory. The Social Democratic Party's Vorwärts explained the motives of the party's members in supporting the government, saying that the vote that night was not only related to the fate of the Brüning cabinet, but also to the safety of the country's representative government system. To cast a negative vote or abstain from voting would be irresponsible and would lead to the dictatorship of the Nazi party. The Democratic Party's Berliner Tageblatt praised Brüning's courage and meticulousness in dealing with the parliamentary difficulties and hoped that he would show the same talent to stabilize the political situation before the parliament reconvenes on December 3. The conservative German World Newspaper stated that the result of the government's victory in Parliament was naturally even more consolidated. Brüning's steadfastness during the debate and his verbal battle with the crowd were admirable. Even opposition newspapers stated that the government had temporarily won in Parliament.</p>

However, because this total solar eclipse can only be observed on this island in the Western Hemisphere, except for overseas locations, the astronomers are flocking to it. It is estimated that the time the sunlight will be completely obscured during this solar eclipse is only 54 seconds, at 9:00 AM on October 22. If there are clouds in the sky at that time, then the astronomers will return disappointed.</p>
<h3 id="e60">New British-Australian Flying Record <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Ten Days and Two Hours</p>
<p>Reuter, Darwin, 19th - The Australian aviator Smith flew from England to Australia in a total of ten days, two hours, and ten minutes, averaging 110 miles per hour, breaking the previous record. Before Smith flew out of England, there were two Englishmen, Hill and McIntosh. Hill lost his qualification for the England-Australia flying competition at the last stop due to a plane crash. When Smith was about to arrive in Atumbau, he saw Hill's plane crash and landed to pick up his companion. According to Smith, Hill had excellent results, but he had to fly at night and encountered a storm, but he was not so unfortunate.</p>
<p>Reuter, Brisbane, 20th - Smith told people that when he was flying from England to Australia, he had a nervous day and smoked cigarettes all day long. Flying is most afraid of smoking, which is regarded as an unforgivable sin, but he was very careful. One of the worst stops on the way was when flying over the European Alps, the plane jumped like a horse. If he had not tied himself with a belt, he would have been thrown out of the plane. He hopes to get married in three weeks.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Central Party Headquarters and National Government Memorial Week <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters On the morning of the 20th, at 9:00 AM, the Central Party Headquarters held the 82nd Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week in the Great Auditorium. Central Committee members Chiang Kai-shek, Dai Chuanxian, Chen Mingshu, Chen Lifu, Liu Luyin, Liu Jiwen, Ke Xinge, Yu Jingtang, and others, as well as officials from various departments and guests, attended, totaling about six to seven hundred people. Chiang Kai-shek presided over the meeting. After the ceremony, the chairman reported, saying that the military campaign against the rebels has now come to an end, and he believed that the comrades of the Party are naturally elated and consider it a matter of great celebration. He believed that the key to the success of the revolution lies in the realization of the Party's principles and the completion of its mission. The difficulties and dangers facing the Party and the country are not before and during the war, but after the war. The difficulties and dangers after the war are even greater than those before and during the war. At this time, what people at home and abroad are paying attention to is what the Party's construction strength will be after the elimination of warlords and reactionaries, and to what extent the construction strength can reach, in order to judge the life of the country. Therefore, the comrades of the Party should be even more diligent in their work and strive hard. They must not be optimistic and negligent. First, they must reflect on themselves, examine their past shortcomings at any time and in any matter, and actively remedy and improve them in order to progress. In this way, even if there were shortcomings in the past, the solar and lunar eclipses will not harm the brightness. Second, they must abide by discipline and not regard the Party Headquarters and Party members as a special class that can be used for personal rights activities, without hesitating to engage in corruption and all dishonorable things. Now, the general public often holds a dissatisfied attitude towards the Party because many Party members seek happiness for themselves and few seek benefits for the people, and the cases of accusations of Party members violating the law in various places are countless, which is very distressing. It must be known that the initial reason for the revolution was that the Manchu Qing used a garrison system in various provinces, and the garrisoned Bannermen regarded themselves as a special class and arbitrarily oppressed the people, so they had to be overthrown by revolutionary force. If our Party members also regard themselves as a special class and do whatever they want, causing the general public to regard them as the garrisoned Bannermen of the past, what will the danger be like? The Party should treat cases of accusations of Party members with utmost fairness and calmness, investigate the facts in detail, and make judgments according to the law, without showing any favor. If they use the name of the Party to swindle and deceive, they should be punished more severely than ordinary laws to protect the Party's reputation and future, and no matter what their position is, they cannot be forgiven. He also vowed to proceed according to this purpose in order to implement it and prevent the loss of law and discipline. Some people now think that there are aspects of the Party's system that need to be improved. In fact, the success of things does not lie in the system, but in the people. If people do not work hard, then even a good system will not help. If Party members work hard, then the Party's strength will inevitably increase, which is enough to suppress all reactionaries and prevent them from existing. He believed that the discovery of Communists and reactionaries in various places is a great disgrace to the Party Headquarters and Party members in various places. For example, the great disturbance of the Communists in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi this time is nothing less than a manifestation of the lack of power of the Party Headquarters in the three provinces. The Party Headquarters in the three provinces cannot shirk their responsibility. He hoped that the Central Party Headquarters and the Party Headquarters at all levels in various provinces and cities would recognize this period as a critical juncture for the life and death of the Party, work together, sacrifice themselves, and strive to increase their strength, so that the Communists can be wiped out as soon as possible and made to disappear forever, so that they can be innocent of the Party, the country, Sun Yat-sen, and the people, and be in line with the spirit of establishing the country with the Party. Chen Mingshu then spoke on the separation of military and civilian affairs and the cooperation between the Party and the government. After the ceremony, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>National Government At 10:00 AM on the same morning, the National Government held Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Ke, Zhu Peide, Ma Fuxiang, He Yaosu, Niu Yongjian, Du Xigui, Yi Peiji, Wang Zhengting, Jiang Menglin, Liu Ruiheng, Kong Xiangxi, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Yi, Zhu Lühe, Wang Jiazhen, Zhang Nanxian, Mu Xiangyue, Chen Yu, Zhang Weihua, Zhang Xixian, Wu Siyu, and officials from the National Government's Secretariat and Military Affairs Department, totaling more than 300 people, attended. Chiang Kai-shek presided over the meeting. First, Zhu Wenzhong, the secretary, gave a political report, followed by a speech by Chairman Chiang. The report of Zhu Wenzhong and the speech of Chiang Kai-shek are recorded as follows: Zhu Wenzhong's report (1) Military aspect: Since the Central Army successively recovered Zhengzhou and Luoyang before last week, the rebel army, except for those who surrendered, were mostly surrounded and disarmed by our army. Less than 30,000 people crossed the Yellow River and fled north. Now, in addition to pursuing them on separate routes, our army has already launched an attack on Tongguan, and has recovered Lingbao on the 16th of this month and is now approaching Tongguan. It is expected that Tongguan can be captured in a matter of days. Another part has already occupied Mengjin, cutting off the rebel army's retreat back to Shaanxi across the Yellow River. At the same time, the people inside Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces have also risen up to drive out the rebels. It can be seen that although China is large, there is no place for Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang to stand. The end of warlords is probably like this. Recalling that when Yan and Feng rebelled, they also claimed to have hundreds of thousands of soldiers, but Yan was defeated in Jinan, and his army was utterly defeated. Feng's subordinates have now lost nine out of ten. It can be seen that an unorganized rabble without principles cannot withstand a single blow from the National Army. Now that the military campaign against the rebels has come to an end, this result should of course be attributed to the brave killing of bandits by the armed comrades in the front, and it can also prove that only the army under the leadership of the Three Principles of the People can survive in China under the Three Principles of the People, and can be invincible and unconquerable. After this powerful proof, we believe that China will never again find an anti-Three Principles of the People force, or find a second Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang who seek their own death. (2) Political aspect: After this great military victory, the government can concentrate all its efforts and shift from the military aspect to the political aspect, and from the passive work aspect to the positive construction aspect. Now, what is most urgent and imperative in the political and construction aspects? The Chairman has already clearly told us in his National Day address to the people of the country: first, to eliminate the bandits and communists; second, to reorganize finance; third, to clear up official corruption; fourth, to develop the economy; and fifth, to vigorously implement local autonomy. These five tasks are indeed the most urgent and imperative tasks that the whole country unanimously recognizes. Whether the Party's tutelage plan can be completed on schedule and whether the foundation of constitutional government can be established on schedule depends on whether these five tasks can be completed in the shortest possible time. At this time, the government should naturally work harder, and at the same time, the people of the country should also work together with the government and strive together in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort and enjoy the happiness of long-term stability. (3) Diplomatic aspect: Recently, what deserves our attention in the diplomatic aspect is the Sino-Soviet Conference, which was officially held in the Russian capital on the 11th of this month. The scope of discussion at this Sino-Soviet Conference, in addition to the Chinese Eastern Railway issue, also includes trade and other issues, which are also on the agenda. However, the first step should be to discuss the Chinese Eastern Railway issue, and then discuss other cases after there are results. We believe that the person responsible for the negotiations this time will be able to abide by the Party's diplomatic policy and the guidelines instructed by the Central Committee, and earnestly and responsibly handle the matter in order to implement Sun Yat-sen's legacy of abolishing all unequal treaties and not betray the ardent hopes of the people of the country. (4) Fourth Plenary Session: At the same time, it is attached to the report that the 112th Standing Committee of the Central Committee has resolved to hold the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee on November 12. We believe that after this Fourth Plenary Session is held, all the aftermath of this military end, as well as the political reform and construction promotion, will be able to comply with Sun Yat-sen's legacy, earnestly plan, and make further efforts to lead the people of the country and complete the tutelage work and establish the foundation of constitutional government. This is the same hope of the Central Committee and the people of the country, and they should make the same efforts.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's speech: Fellow comrades, the military campaign has now come to an end. Thanks to Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven and the efforts of the comrades in the front and rear, the rebels have been successively eliminated. The government and the people of the country all consider it to be the most pleasant thing, but we cannot yet consider it to be something to celebrate, because the great difficulties of tomorrow are still not resolved. The opportunity for the security of the Party and the country lies not before the campaign against Yan and Feng, but after the campaign against Yan and Feng. Previously, the government's actions received little attention, but in the future, every move of the government will be under the attention of the general public. Therefore, whether we can build a country based on the Three Principles of the People depends entirely on the efforts after the campaign against Yan and Feng, whether we can completely change the bad habits of the past and realize a new life, all depends on the concerted efforts of the government's colleagues. As for politics, there is no end to it, and it is progressing day by day. If we know that there are shortcomings, we must strive to correct them. We must not treat national affairs as personal matters, and we must distinguish between public and private matters. Only in this way can we achieve good results. Therefore, no matter what organization it is, it must check its work every day and every week. If there are any errors, we must seek to correct them. Foreigners criticize China, saying that it can talk but cannot act. This statement is very accurate. Now, there are many painful points in domestic and foreign affairs. The aggression of imperialism continues unabated. This cannot be blamed on foreigners, but on whether we can reflect on ourselves. China has been repeatedly bullied by foreigners, and the reason for this is that we cannot cheer up. From now on, I firmly believe that if the government and the people of the country can work together, the politics will gradually get on track and the foundation of the government will become more and more consolidated. I hope that my colleagues will make every effort to remedy their own shortcomings in order to wash away the shame of being able to talk but not act.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Sino-Russian Conference Opens as Scheduled <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Location: Russian Foreign Affairs Committee</p>
<p>First Item on the Agenda: Trade Agreement Issues</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The Sino-Russian conference opened at 11:00 AM on the 11th at the Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Committee building in Moscow. The plenipotentiaries of both sides, along with their respective secretaries and staff, arrived at the meeting before 11:00 AM and held the opening ceremony at 12:00 PM. The Soviet Russian Plenipotentiary Karakhan delivered the opening address, stating: "The Sino-Russian conference, convened according to the meeting minutes signed by the Chinese and Russian representatives in Boli on December 22, 1929, has officially opened today. According to the Boli meeting minutes, this conference was originally scheduled to convene on January 25 of this year. It is deeply regrettable that various issues delayed it for nine months. This conference is of great importance to the relationship between the two great nations of China and Russia. We hope that no further obstacles will arise in the future and that it will proceed smoothly to the end. Our mission is to discuss and resolve all issues between China and Russia based on the Boli minutes and the 1924 Beijing Agreement. The Soviet Russian policy towards China has been explained in the declarations issued to the Chinese people in 1919 and 1920 and has been implemented. All rights forcibly and illegally seized by Tsarist Russia from the Chinese people have been renounced. This is a clear demonstration of goodwill towards the Chinese people and support for the Chinese people in abolishing unequal treaties that hinder their struggle for freedom. After the signing of the Sino-Russian agreement in 1924, Soviet Russia has treated China on an equal footing. However, it is deeply regrettable that the Chinese people have not yet achieved equal status with other countries. The representative sincerely hopes that China will achieve this goal in the near future. The Soviet Russian government has always adhered to the Beijing and Fengtian Agreements. Unfortunately, a dispute arose between the two countries in 1929, lasting for six months, leading to the severance of diplomatic relations and even armed conflict. It was not until the signing of the Boli minutes on December 22, 1929, that the issue was resolved. On the border, both sides ceased hostilities and restored peace, and the effect of the Sino-Russian agreement was restored. The Eastern Railway also returned to its state before the outbreak of the Sino-Russian dispute. Therefore, the Boli minutes are also of utmost importance. I believe that the Chinese delegation gathered here with us today will recognize the great significance of the agreements signed in Beijing and Fengtian in 1924 and the meeting minutes signed in Boli in 1929 in the international community, as they can introduce international peace and friendship between China and Russia. Therefore, I hope that both sides will strictly abide by the above three agreements and strive to promote the future friendship between China and Russia. At the same time, I would like to hear the opinions of the Chinese delegation on what I have said and welcome the Chinese Plenipotentiary Mo Dehui and the members of the delegation. I deeply hope that the conference will proceed smoothly, resolve all disputes, strengthen the spirit of cooperation between China and Russia, and maintain peace in the Far East." Next, the Chinese Plenipotentiary Mo Dehui replied: "Based on the declarations issued by Soviet Russia to China in 1919 and 1920, I believe that the Chinese government and people absolutely hope for peace and maintain the friendship between China and Russia. China will never violate the agreement signed in 1924 and will always promote the welfare of the people of both countries in good faith. The dispute that occurred last year was due to a temporary misunderstanding on both sides, which is deeply regrettable. Despite the dispute of the past year, the Chinese people, as always, are willing to seek friendship between China and Russia. Of course, we cannot violate all Sino-Russian agreements, as this is also an international obligation. Today, the Sino-Russian conference opens to resolve all issues. I hope that both sides can proceed with sincerity, as declared during the preparatory meetings, so that the conference will proceed smoothly and the results will be satisfactory." After the exchange of greetings, both sides examined each other's credentials. After that, there was a general discussion, and the meeting adjourned at around 3:00 PM. The discussion of the agenda will begin on the 12th. It is reported that the preliminary issue has been determined to be trade agreement matters. (13th)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Recent Military Deployment in the Northeast <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The First and Second Armies of the Northeast have already arrived in the Pingjin area. The Frontier Defense Headquarters received telegrams from various armies yesterday stating that the First Army, responsible for the Pinghan Railway defense line, has arrived at Shijiazhuang. The Sixth Brigade of Bai Fengxiang, under its command, is currently stationed at Fangshunqiao. Because there are still two regiments of the Jin Army under Li Fuying in Wangdu, Gaoyang, and other places, they have not moved forward. Most of the First Army is currently concentrated in various areas south of Baoding. Its mission on the PingSui Railway is up to Kangzhuang and they have not moved forward yet. The Second Army, under Wang Shuchang, is responsible for the Jinpu Railway defense and has advanced to Dongguang and Botou, awaiting further orders. As for the Third Army under the organization of Hu Yukun, it was originally planned and decided, but due to various reasons, it has been temporarily postponed. The speed of the army's organization will be determined based on the difficulty of resolving the Chahar-Suiyuan issue after Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang arrives in Ping. Fortunately, the highest authorities have already made preparations for the selection of the commander of the Third Army and the senior officers of the army headquarters. The organization can be completed as soon as the order is issued. However, regarding the troops belonging to the army, Zhang Xueliang previously stated that if necessary, the Northeast would continue to organize the Third and Fourth Armies, with troops jointly deployed from Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. Later, the organization of the Third Army was changed, and it would still be formed solely by the troops of Liaoning Province, consisting of the 24th Infantry Brigade of Huang Shiyue, the 20th Infantry Brigade of Huang Jingzhong, the 16th Infantry Brigade of Miao Zhengliu, and the 3rd Cavalry Brigade of Zhang Shusen. Now, because the troops of Liaoning Province will inevitably feel that the allocation is insufficient and it is necessary to consider both local defense, it was proposed to add new brigades to fill the defense at the previous cadre meeting. However, due to the issue of funding and equipment, it could not be realized as scheduled. Recently, it was heard that the authorities, in order to gather a strong force, specially telegraphed Chairman Jiang, deciding to add five new brigades, which will be implemented soon. There are rumors that after Deputy Commander Zhang arrives in Ping, he will start organizing them. Zhang's trip to Ping is expected to be around the 20th of this month. He has ordered the Staff and Adjutant Departments of the Frontier Headquarters to actively prepare. It is planned to take more than 200 officials, as well as a brigade of guards, a mortar team, a portable machine gun company, a plainclothes detective team, a pistol team, etc. Zhang specially issued a handwritten order yesterday for the entire air force to be fully mobilized, and appointed Zhang Zuoxiang, the acting commander of the Northeast Air Force, to enter the pass to command everything. After receiving the order, the Air Force Department has begun to organize it, with a total of four squadrons, each with 12 aircraft and one squadron leader. Once the organization is complete, they will depart. (October 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Shantou Da Guang Dong Case Under Negotiation <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Circles Decide to Demonstrate Against France</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: In the case of the French ship Da Guang Dong killing Cai Yuqin, a worker at the Yihua Inn, and injuring six Chinese workers on the 3rd of this month, the Shantou people were extremely indignant. People from all walks of life formed the "Thirteen Tragedy Support Association" to act as a diplomatic support for the government and decided to hold a city-wide strike and market closure on the 18th to hold a large-scale demonstration against France. French Consul Eugene, fearing the expansion of the incident, went to the city government on the 13th and arranged for a responsible commissioner to be sent to the French consulate on the morning of the 14th to start negotiations. On the morning of the 14th, the city government sent Secretary Chen Shoupeng to the consulate. Our side demanded the extradition of the murderer for punishment, a formal letter of apology from the French consul, compensation for the dead and injured, and a guarantee that the above-mentioned incident would not occur again in the future. It is reported that as a result of the discussion, the French consul agreed to hand over the French ship owner Nakeli, who caused the incident on the Da Guang Dong, to the Saigon Court in Vietnam for trial. The photos and family history of Cai Yuqin before and after his death were transferred to Annam. The evidence of each injured person was also sent to Annam by the French consul. The French consul promised to send the trial confession and the circumstances at the time to Shantou in photographs to prove that the French government would not harbor criminals. As for the apology, it can only be discussed after a legal judgment is made. The French consul has agreed to the compensation issue, with the only dispute being the amount. The negotiations on this case on the 14th have generally shown signs of progress. The French consul has arranged to negotiate again on the 17th. The indignation of the people has reached an extreme level. On the 15th, it was decided to unanimously implement an economic boycott of France. On the 16th, a representative conference will be held again to discuss the order of the parade. French Consul Eugene sent a special letter to the city government today, requesting that it be responsible for protecting French citizens in Shantou on that day. It is reported that a certain French warship stationed in Shanghai has been telegraphed to come to Shantou on the 18th to take care of everything. The original letter from the French consul to the city government is recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter from the French Consul: To the Esteemed Sirs: Having recently read in the newspaper that there will be a demonstration parade on the 18th of this month regarding the Da Guang Dong case, the consulate believes that this case is already under negotiation and that such intimidating actions are meaningless. If it is absolutely necessary to hold the demonstration, the consulate formally requests that Your Worship Mayor strictly guarantee the safety of French nationals in this country. If an accident occurs, the full and definite responsibility will be borne by the local officials of Shantou. This letter is hereby sent for your information and reply.</p>
<p>Reply from the City Government: To the Esteemed Sirs: We acknowledge receipt of your letter (the text is omitted as above). Upon investigation, this Mayor should be responsible at all times for protecting the safety of all foreign nationals residing within the boundaries of this city, except for those who are currently committing crimes. Please do not be overly concerned, Your Worship Consul. However, regarding the case of the ship owner and sailors of the Da Guang Dong brutally killing Cai Yuqin and injuring Zheng Diangui and six others, this Mayor sent a letter to Your Worship Consul on the 5th of this month requesting the detention of the murderers for interrogation, and on the 8th of this month, submitted six conditions in a letter requesting that you expedite the handling and provide a satisfactory response to the case. Many days have passed, but Your Worship Consul has not provided a single word in response. This Mayor is deeply concerned about this. If this case is not resolved as soon as possible, public sentiment will become increasingly indignant, which will be detrimental to the friendship between the two countries and the feelings of the people of the two countries. We are sending this letter again to request Your Worship Consul to uphold humanity, take into account the friendship between the two countries, and immediately provide a satisfactory response to the six conditions proposed by this Mayor in order to appease public outrage. This is what we hope for. (October 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Fujian Authorities Thoroughly Suppress Lu <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The Fujian Provincial Party, Government, and Military authorities held a joint meeting at the Provincial Party Headquarters on the 13th. Those present included Provincial Party Committee members Zhan Diaoyuan, Wang Huaijin, Lin Huangjuan, Kang Shaozhou, Feng Ji'an, Chen Lianfen, and Gan Yun, Provincial Government Committee members Chen Peikun, Lin Jinan, and Jiang Pingfan, Chen Jiliang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Marine Corps, represented by Ye Xinchuan, Liu Heding, the Commander of the 56th Division, Lin Shouguo, the Brigade Commander of the 2nd Brigade of the Marine Corps, and Qian Yuguang, the Brigade Commander of the 1st Brigade of the Provisional Provincial Defense Army. The meeting was chaired by Zhan Diaoyuan and passed important resolutions: (1) Request the National Government to thoroughly suppress Lu, (2) Request strict orders to all armies not to incorporate bandits, (3) Request strict orders to local military and political authorities to prohibit opium and gambling. On the same day, the Provincial Party Headquarters also sent a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters, stating that the military campaign to suppress Lu in this province has been going on for several months. Recently, the progress of the provincial army has been rapid, and it should not be difficult to completely eliminate them. Unexpectedly, after Lu's defeat, he sent Yang Yugu to Shanghai with funds, and then Sun Benrong came to the province from Shanghai, requesting a ceasefire from the authorities on the condition of returning the six captured people and Lu Xingbang and Xingrong resigning. The association believes that negotiating peace with Lu will undermine the prestige of the Central Government and protect Lu's strength, which is not only a problem for Fujian Province, but also a worry for the Party and the country. It is requested that your association quickly forward the request to the National Government, and immediately telegraph the political and military authorities of Fujian Province to thoroughly suppress Lu, and at the same time eliminate the communist bandits to prevent future troubles and stabilize Fujian's territory. On the 14th, the Provincial Government also received telegrams from the Fujian Fellow Association in Nanjing and Shanghai, requesting the thorough suppression of Lu and opposing the ceasefire negotiations. Therefore, the provincial authorities have returned to a more active approach to the military campaign to suppress Lu. Yan Er'ai, the Forward Commander of the Eastern Route Army, Liu Shangzhi, the Commander of the Central Column, and Gui Zhenyuan, the Commander of the Left Wing Column, left for Minqing from the provincial capital on the 15th to make arrangements. Lin Shouguo, the Commander of the Right Wing Column, and Brigade Commander Qian Yuguang, will also go to Gutian to make arrangements after making clear arrangements in the province. It is expected that the second phase of the third phase of the war will be launched within a few days. (October 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Xu Zhuoran Case Transferred to Hangzhou for Trial <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The Process of Chen Yanxiang and Others Being Falsely Accused</p>
<p>On May 29th of this year, Xu Zhuoran arrived in Tongan from Xiamen and accepted the invitation of Xiao, the regiment commander of the Tongan garrison training regiment, to raise 30,000 yuan for the army and abolish various exorbitant taxes. In the afternoon of the same day, Xu visited Chen Yanxiang, the general manager of the Tongmei Motor Company, saying that he would mortgage the Tongma Road to borrow 20,000 yuan from the Tongmei, Anxi, and Quanan companies. He insisted that Chen accompany him to Jimei to visit Ye Caizhen and meet with Ye to discuss the loan. Ye said that he could only agree with the consent of the Xiamen board of directors, so he arranged to go to Xiamen the next day to discuss it properly. That night, they stayed at the Jimei Science Museum. The next morning, Xu and Chen returned to Tongan and asked Chen to go to the Quanan Company to meet Chen Qingji and Wu Jingyu to discuss the loan. Chen and Wu both said that they could first inquire with the Anxi Company and then share the loan with the Tongmei Company. After the negotiations, Xu and Chen returned to Tongan. Xu went to the regimental headquarters, and Chen returned to the company. In the afternoon, Xu went from the regimental headquarters to the Tongmei Company and again asked Chen to go to Jimei to invite Ye to go to Xiamen together. By the time they arrived at Ye, Ye had already left, leaving a business card with the address of Fengyi Qianzhuang in Taishi Lane, Xiamen, and the phone number 870. Xu showed Chen the business card and urged Chen to go together. They then took a boat to Gaoqi and landed, and then took an ordinary car to Meirengong. When the car arrived at the station, Xu instructed his follower Xu Mu to take the luggage to the Nanhua Hotel. Chen took the opportunity to board the Quanhe Company upstairs because the Tongmei Company and Quanhe Company had recently joined tickets, and asked whether the company directors Ke, Chen, Xue, etc. had any new electric boats. Then he went downstairs and took a rickshaw with Xu to the intersection of Hengsheng Street, Kaiyuan Road. Xu walked ahead to Miaohou Street. Because he did not know the address of Fengyi Qianzhuang, he told Chen to go ahead. Chen walked to Taishi Lane, not more than three steps away from Xu. As soon as he entered Fengyi Qianzhuang, he suddenly heard gunshots behind him, and Xu fell in response. Chen immediately telegraphed the Nanhua Hotel and the Public Security Bureau and sent someone to invite a doctor. When Xu was taken to the Salvation Hospital, Chen and Ye Caizhen went to the hospital to visit him and reported the matter in detail to He Ziyang, Lin Fangyuan, Li Shou, Huang Yangtingxiu, etc. After the incident, Chen Yanxiang, Ye Caizhen, and others were accused by Xu's family of being suspected of assassination and were arrested. After investigation by the Siming District Court, it was determined that Chen, Ye, and others were indeed not suspicious and were immediately released. On June 2nd, Chen Yanxiang was summoned and detained again. He could have been released on bail, but Xu Zhuoran's wife and the staff of Xu's funeral office insisted on detaining him, so Chen was imprisoned for the second time. On July 5th, the procuratorate obtained a confession from another suspect, Chen Delin, clarifying that he had been tortured into falsely accusing Chen Yanxiang. After investigation by the court, Chen Yanxiang was allowed to be released on bail again. Later, the Supreme Court of Nanjing sent Prosecutor Ouyang Shu to Xiamen to investigate, believing that the Siming District Court should recuse itself under such circumstances. Therefore, the case was transferred to the Hangzhou District Court for trial. Ye Caizhen, upon learning of this, went to Hangzhou on his own on the 11th of this month to surrender. Chen Yanxiang, because he did not have time to file a petition in the Siming District Court, requested to go to Hangzhou on his own to surrender and was arrested. On the 14th, he and Chen Delin and others were escorted to Shanghai and then transferred to Hangzhou to await trial. It is reported that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Fujian Fellow Association in Shanghai, and other organizations have appealed on behalf of Chen Yanxiang, requesting that the Hangzhou District Court handle the case impartially to clear the injustice.</p>

(9) If a business registration certificate is lost or damaged, it shall report it to the collection agency and apply for a new certificate. (10) Whether it is a new certificate, an exchange certificate, or a replacement certificate, each business registration certificate shall be subject to a fee of 2 jiao. (11) After the implementation of these regulations, all those who operate without a certificate or conceal their capital and underreport shall be required to make up the payment in accordance with the amount found and shall be fined twice the amount to be paid. (12) All those who have already paid the pawnshop tax and the brokerage tax in this province shall not be required to pay the registration fee again, but they shall still register and obtain a certificate, and a fee of 2 jiao shall be charged uniformly.

<p>The Chinese Marine Research Institute was established in Qingdao this summer. On the 17th of this month, the second congress was held at the Academia Sinica in the capital. Those present included Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, Yi Peiji, Zhu Kezhen, Chen Shaokuan, Jiang Menglin, Yang Xingfo, and Song Chunfang. The following resolutions were made:</p>
<p>1. Expenses: Mr. Song Chunfang reported that the preparatory plan of the Chinese Marine Research Institute is divided into three major phases. The first phase is construction: (1) aquarium, (2) marine museum, (3) marine library. The first congress had decided to set up an aquarium in Qingdao first. The budget for its construction and start-up costs is 20,000 yuan, of which 10,000 yuan will be borne by the local agencies in Qingdao: 5,000 yuan by the municipal government, 3,000 yuan by the Qingdao Observatory, 1,000 yuan by Qingdao University, and 1,000 yuan by Mr. Song Chunfang himself through fundraising. The remaining 10,000 yuan will be borne separately by other academic institutions in China, such as the Academia Sinica, and various administrative agencies related to oceanography itself, such as the Navy Department, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, and the Ministry of Education. Since the representatives of the various ministries and departments are present today, please decide on the allocation method of this 10,000 yuan. As for the construction of the aquarium, its appearance will be in the shape of a Chinese city wall. A gate tower will be built on the gate of the museum, which will be quite representative of the inherent architectural spirit of China. At present, the preparatory work is temporarily undertaken by the staff of the Marine Science Department of the Qingdao Observatory, which is completely voluntary, so there are no various expenses. It was decided that the following ministries and departments would each bear 2,000 yuan: (1) Academia Sinica (2) Peiping Research Institute (3) Navy Department (4) Ministry of Education (5) Ministry of Industry and Commerce (Minister Kong was absent due to illness) (6) Ministry of Agriculture and Mining will pay in four installments, 500 yuan per installment, from the end of October to the end of January of the 20th year, and the Ministry of Education will collect the money on its behalf (2) Mr. Zhu Kezhen proposed to change the name of the institute. Mr. Li Shizeng said that it is better to use the old name. Now the interest of the knowledge class in various places in the study of oceanography has gradually become stronger. For example, this autumn, someone in Beidaihe also proposed to set up a marine research institute. After the marine research institutes in various places are established in turn, each will be prefixed with the name of the place, such as Qingdao Chinese Marine Research Institute, Beidaihe Marine Research Institute, etc., and then "divide and combine" to become a systematic academic institution. (3) Mr. Song Chunfang proposed to increase the number of members of the committee. It was decided that the number of members of the committee would be increased from fifteen to nineteen. (4) Liu Hongsheng, Song Wusheng, Zheng Hongnian, and Gao Lu were publicly elected as preparatory members of the association.</p>

However, according to reports from various schools, most have not yet completed their studies. Therefore, it has been decided to first verify the Three Principles of the People, and then proceed to other books later.

The original text of the "Brief Rules" and "Instructions" are transcribed below:</p>

<p>Japanese Rice Difficult to Sell</p>
<p>In the past two days, the amount of rice arriving has been unusually abundant. The highest price of new japonica rice is only about 15 yuan and 50 cents per stone, and new Songjiang rice is only 14 yuan. As for the amount of Japanese rice arriving, it is said that it has been transported in four or five batches, totaling more than 32,000 bags. A very small number of bags were taken out of the warehouse a few days ago, but now it has been stalled for several days, and even sample rice is being rejected.

<h3 id="e106">Urging Active Preparations for Grain Storage Today <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received instructions from the Department of Civil Affairs yesterday, stating: In order to comply with the matter, the Provincial Government's 6335th instruction states: "In accordance with the Ministry of Interior's consultation, the preparation of grain storage is an important policy for preparing for famine and providing relief to the poor. The Ministry previously presented and approved the promulgation of the 'Local Granary Management Rules' in January of the 19th year, which was repeatedly consulted to the provinces, urging all counties, districts, townships, and towns to set up granaries to maintain the people's food supply. In the case, for half a year, according to the information reported by the provinces, most of the old Changping and other granaries in the counties have either collapsed and no longer exist, or have been moved for other purposes. The community granaries and charity granaries that were previously run in the villages have also been suspended for a long time and cannot be rebuilt. Even if a small number of counties have warehouses and factories, the remaining warehouse funds have mostly been used up, making it difficult to organize. Now, at the time of autumn harvest, most provinces have had a bumper harvest, and we should take this opportunity to carefully reorganize the original granaries in various places in accordance with the above rules. Those who have no granaries should actively prepare them to provide relief. On the one hand, the government should allocate public funds and store as much new grain as possible to prevent poor farmers from selling their grain at low prices due to livelihood pressures, resulting in low grain prices harming farmers. In addition to consulting separately, it is also necessary to consult the provincial government to examine and, in accordance with the Ministry's document of September 16 this year, instruct its subordinates to handle the matter together." This case was previously submitted to the Provincial Government for forwarding to the Yuan Ling, which ordered all counties to comply immediately, allocate warehouse funds, and store grain. If there are no existing funds, or if the funds are insufficient, measures should also be taken to borrow and purchase warehouses, and guarantees should be made. The county magistrate has complied with this order, but in the event of a famine, no delay is allowed. Therefore, the county magistrate is ordered to comply with the previous order and handle the matter seriously, without treating it as a mere formality, lest it cause inconvenience, and report the handling situation at any time. This order!</p>

<p>The use of the Gregorian calendar for year-end closing by businesses has been officially mandated by the National Government. However, recent opinions expressed by various trade associations indicate that, due to the agricultural nature of our country, a large-scale year-end closing is feared to cause various obstacles. It is proposed to petition for approval to postpone the implementation in accordance with business practices. It is reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce considers this matter to be of great importance and has submitted it to the fifth regular meeting of the Executive Committee of the Chamber on the 17th of this month to discuss this issue. It was resolved that a committee should be organized to conduct a detailed study before submitting it to the Executive Committee for discussion. Zhu Yinjiang, Luo Qinghua, Lu Wenshao, Wang Yansong, and Xu Jiqing were publicly elected as members and will begin the study immediately.</p>

<p>Rice Milling Industry Also Requests Postponement</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Milling Trade Association submitted a document to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>Petition for Postponement of Year-End Closing for the Nineteenth Year, Requesting Approval to Alleviate Business Difficulties. Our association has twice followed the Gregorian calendar for year-end closing at the fifth and ninth months, and the difficulties encountered are the same as those reported by the bean and rice merchants' association. This has been observed for a long time and need not be repeated. We believe that the unification of the national calendar is one thing, and the year-end closing of businesses is another. We must not think that requesting a postponement of the year-end closing implies a desire to abandon the Gregorian calendar, nor can we consider alleviating business difficulties to be a superstitious practice. Although the government's policy implementation should not be delayed by long-standing difficulties, reforming customs requires careful consideration of public sentiment to gradually move towards the right track. The accounts from the previous fifth and ninth months have not yet been fully settled. If a postponement is not granted, it will inevitably lead to hardship for businesses and farmers. Is the government's reform of the Gregorian calendar specifically intended to cause hardship for businesses and farmers? We believe that postponing the year-end closing would hinder the promotion of the Gregorian calendar. After careful deliberation, we believe that reforming the Gregorian calendar and the year-end closing of businesses are two separate matters. Therefore, we specifically submit this document to support the suggestion of the bean and rice merchants' association to request a postponement of the year-end closing. We sincerely hope that the Bureau will consider the difficulties of businesses and grant the request. We eagerly await your response and respectfully submit this to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Record of the Silk Factory Trade Association General Meeting <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Abolishing Cocoon Exchanges...Reducing Taxes...Improving Inspection The Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association convened a general meeting of all silk factories in Shanghai at 3 p.m. on the 19th. Executive Committee members Zhu Jingan, Huang Jinfan, Zhang Peishen, and others, as well as more than 130 representatives from all factories, attended. Shen Huachen chaired the meeting and, after performing the rituals, first submitted the outline of the resolution of the Special Committee for the Relief of the Silk Industry, which requested the government to issue 10 million yuan in public bonds for the silk industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai to cover losses and provide guarantees, to the attendees for a vote. It was unanimously passed. Regarding the method of distributing the bond amount, it was resolved that it should be directly distributed to each factory. Subsequently, the representatives resolved three major issues: (1) The proposal to abolish cocoon exchanges in various provinces. The attendees noted that since the implementation of opening up cocoon exchanges, the number of newly added cocoon exchanges in various provinces has been increasing almost daily. However, the production of silkworm cocoons is limited. With more exchanges and less goods, they inevitably engage in price competition, leading to high cocoon prices. Farmers, seeing the high cocoon prices, increase the number of silkworm eggs they raise. The supply of mulberry leaves is insufficient, and the silkworms are fed before they have enough leaves, resulting in thin and inferior cocoons that are not suitable for silk reeling. The raw materials for silk factories are thus becoming increasingly scarce. It is urgent to restrict the establishment of cocoon exchanges to avoid price competition and reduce the cost of cocoons. At the same time, a survey should be conducted on the production of mulberry leaves in various silkworm-producing areas to determine the appropriate number of silkworm eggs to raise, in order to ensure the quality of cocoons. It was resolved to petition the government to separately abolish them. (2) The proposal to reduce the burden on the industry. The attendees noted that silk, tea, and other items from our country are the largest exports in trade. The government should provide encouragement to promote the development of Chinese silk, which is of utmost importance. The price of Chinese silk trade usually fluctuates with the market price abroad, and the rise and fall of foreign firms' prices are difficult to predict. The right to bargain is in the hands of foreign merchants. It is urgent to petition the government to exempt cocoon taxes and export silk taxes to reduce the burden and lower costs, in order to compete for survival. It was resolved to urge the government to effectively reduce and exempt taxes to maintain the silk industry. (3) The proposal for public weighing and inspection of factory silk. The chairman reported that Mr. Wang Xiaolai of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce had previously invited both parties to talk, and the Bureau had acknowledged that the public weighing and inspection has value for research and improvement in the future. The attendees believed that if the public weighing and inspection is to continue in the future, the improvement plan must be clearly announced first to convince people. It is not possible to ignore it and muddle through. It was resolved to urge Mr. Wang Xiaolai to press the Commodity Inspection Bureau to provide a concrete response. The meeting adjourned after the discussion at 9:30 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Silk Inspection Office Investigates the Recent Situation of Silk Factories <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The sales of raw silk are most dependent on the United States. Recently, credit has become unusually tight in the United States, causing silk sales to stagnate. Japanese and Italian silk have been greatly affected, and Chinese silk is unlikely to escape this exception. Many silk factories in Shanghai have suspended operations due to this impact. Director Miao of the Raw Silk Inspection Office of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau is very concerned about this matter. He recently sent staff from the office to six districts, including Hongkou, Zhabei, South Bund, North Bund, West Shanghai, and Tientongan, to conduct a thorough investigation of the recent situation of various silk factories. The current statistics show that out of 106 silk factories in Shanghai, 60 have suspended operations, 43 have not suspended operations, and 3 are operating intermittently. The period of suspension for the factories that have suspended operations is mostly from the end of August to the beginning of September.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Another Large Batch of Chinese Laborers Sent Back by Japanese Authorities <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Due to the contraction of various factories and fields in Japan this year, many Chinese laborers in Japan have been laid off and cannot survive. As a result, many batches have been sent back to China by the Japanese authorities. Recently, a group of laid-off Chinese from Ishijima-cho, Omori-cho, and Mikawashima in Tokyo Prefecture were sent back to Shanghai by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department with the consent of our country's embassy in Japan because they had no means of livelihood. The group included 22 workers: Zhou Qinlin, Pan Tingxi, Pan Ali, Huang Richang, Zhou Youfu, Mei Aliang, Wu Zhenyou, Huang Yinbiao, Wu Yanzhou, Wu Yanxi, Li Deji, and others. There were also 10 laborers: Lin Shangzhou, Zhou Xiannan, Wang Shixia, Xia Zuodong, Jiang Yanxing, Zhu Chengmei, Liu Yinmei, Chen Yazuo, and others. They were all escorted to Shanghai on the Japanese ship Tsukuba Maru. The Japanese Embassy had telegraphed the Shanghai Public Security Bureau in advance, requesting that personnel be sent to assist with disembarkation. Therefore, the Public Security Bureau sent personnel to the dock to assist when the Tsukuba Maru entered the port. Most of the repatriated Chinese laborers were from Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province. They were all in a miserable state upon their return. It is now planned to send these laborers back to their original homes in Eastern Zhejiang.</p>

<p>Three Major Issues Resolved</p>
<p>The New Kang Ship Disaster Family Association of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company held a temporary emergency meeting of the Executive Committee at the Defengli Hall at 2:30 p.m. yesterday. All committee members attended. Standing Committee member Zhu chaired the meeting and began by stating that there were three issues for today's temporary meeting: (1) Representatives of various affected families have come to the association to request assistance. (2) Lawsuit procedures. (3) The association's accumulated expenses since February. These three issues are of great importance and must be resolved in the shortest possible time, otherwise they will greatly hinder the handling of this case. He asked for detailed discussion on how to deal with these issues. Committee members Chen and Zhu then expressed their opinions and provided in-depth solutions to the three issues. The chairman then took a vote on each issue.

<h3 id="e120">Shanghai Citizens State That the Water Company Does Not Know How to Conserve <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Too Many Redundant Foreign Employees, Discriminatory Treatment of Chinese Workers</p>
<p>According to the New Voice Society, the Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Real Estate Association yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that we have recently received a letter from citizens Yao Rennan, Mao Tinghou, Zhu Yisheng, Lu Futang, Huang Huanfan, and others, stating that the price increase of water is a matter of public concern to citizens and should not be allowed to increase. Even if the budget is insufficient, efforts should be made to reduce expenses. Now that your association is auditing the accounts, it is a fundamental solution. We, representing the opinions of citizens, are presenting the following points for your research. We have heard factory employees talk about various wasteful practices by the general manager and deputy general manager, which we will describe for your reference, so that the water price may be kept the same. Under the former manager A.P. Wood ten years ago, expenses were very frugal. Under the current manager, with Mr. Zhuang as the main person in charge, many useless foreigners are employed. For example, the Machinery Department used to have only one person, Muller, but now a deputy, Moohnn, has been added, and recently another person has been added, whose name is unknown. The management of outdoor coolies used to have only one person, Y. Mollion, but before his term expired, Mudhood was added, and recently another person has been added. The Construction Department used to have Brodlag, but because his term expired, Reloyo was added. In the Third Generation Transportation Department, in addition to three useless British people rotating every eight hours, there are also fifty useless Russian people watching over the Chinese workers every eight hours. The salaries of these British people are at least five hundred yuan, and they are provided with housing. Moreover, two new British buyers, Preyther and Wills, have been added to the Freight Department. The above only refers to the Yangshupu Water Plant at Nos. 53 and 54. The number of British people added to the Jiangxi Road and Xinzha Road branches is not counted. The urgent task now is to dismiss all the Russian people, and then remove the deputies and assistant British people. Each department should only have one British manager. Ten years ago, when the departments were not divided, there were only three people in the water plant, including the general manager, deputy general manager, and manager. At that time, the annual profit was quite high and the water price was very low. From this, it can be seen that efficiency lies in quality, not quantity. As for the Russian people, they were brought in by the manager on the pretext of laziness. The former manager, who served for decades, never had any laziness in the factory. The current manager rejects the requests of Chinese workers, but after three months of work for British people in the factory, they are given a raise, and after three years of service, they are given six months of vacation to return home. In addition, they also have one month of vacation each year. Chinese workers do not receive such preferential treatment. Although Chinese workers work eight hours, they are often mistreated by British and Russian people. The former lower-level British person, Dounalay, even fired more than ten old Chinese workers who had been in the factory for more than ten years. Later, he was fired recently because he got into a dispute with a fellow British person while drunk. Others, such as the current MeMahen and Gohons, are also fierce and treat Chinese workers as enemies. These people not only increase expenses but also easily create resentment. In fact, they should not be hired. Under the former manager, there was also Shen Anfu, who had a monthly salary of more than eighty yuan. Since Shen's death, there has been no foreman with a salary of more than seventy yuan, except for a copper craftsman foreman. Also, the number of people in the chemical laboratory has increased from one to four. All of these issues need to be changed urgently. If the manager says that the three shifts of British people should not be completely removed, then Chinese people can be used to replace them. As for the Russian people and the three British deputies, they must be completely removed. If ten percent of the savings are given to the Chinese as foremen and long-term workers, then labor unrest will never occur again. Not only will the water price not need to be increased, but it can also be greatly reduced. Wouldn't that be killing multiple birds with one stone? We are now publishing the original letter and requesting that the Shanghai Real Estate Association inform the citizens so that all residents of the city can have a deep understanding and sympathy. They will inevitably rise up to make this firm demand. Even for future price increases, we can use this as a basis for negotiations. We are writing to you for your information and reference." This letter is addressed to the Shanghai Real Estate Association.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Jiangxi People in Shanghai Set Date to Hold General Meeting <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Seeking Ways to Relieve Bandit Disasters</p>
<p>Jiangxi has been ravaged by bandits and communists for years. The scale of burning and killing is far greater than in Changsha, Hailufeng, and other places. Recently, Ji'an, Raozhou, Linjiang, and other places have fallen one after another, and Ganzhou is also in imminent danger. Compatriots from the province have repeatedly telegraphed Shanghai for help. Jiangxi compatriots in Shanghai previously sent Wu Nanpu and Zeng Yuchen to Beijing to petition the National Government and pay respects to President Hu, lamenting everything. Yesterday, the association convened a temporary executive committee meeting. Huang Baoxiang, Xu Yuangao, Kong Zizhen, Chen Baixu, Lu Haiquan, Liu Zhigang, and others agreed that the disastrous communist banditry suffered by Jiangxi Province has not received enough attention from the people of the country due to a lack of publicity. Therefore, it was decided to expand publicity to encourage the people of the country to jointly seek relief. The first step is to hold a general meeting of Jiangxi compatriots in Shanghai at the Jiangxi Guild Hall in Xiaonanmen at 1 p.m. on the 23rd of this month to plan everything. Notices have already been sent out, and it is expected that there will be a tragic scene at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Hunan People in Shanghai Launch Hunan Relief Movement <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Three Proposals Resolved</p>
<p>More than 7,000 Hunan people have taken refuge in Shanghai. Although Changsha is fortunate to be safe, communist bandits are lurking in various counties in eastern and northern Hunan, as well as in the towns and villages of Changsha, and are constantly rioting, so they still dare not return to the province. Representatives were elected to hold a meeting at the Huizhong Hotel yesterday, with Tang Yuesong as chairman. More than fifty people attended. After refugees who had recently fled from Yueyang reported, the entire room burst into tears. They all agreed that the overall situation has been roughly stabilized, and they should actively work to eliminate the communists and remove He Jian. It was resolved: (1) To send additional representatives to Beijing to work together with the original representative, Shen Zuru. (2) To push representatives to act in unison with representatives from Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong. (3) To petition Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to punish and remove He Jian. (4) To issue a circular telegram and declaration. It is reported that these proposals are already being implemented in various ways.</p>

<p>Request to Issue Ship Surveyor Certificates The Shanghai maritime community is in the process of recovering the ship surveyor positions from the Customs and having them operated by Chinese. Liu Fupei, Li Yuncheng, Huang Shaosan, and Wang Guisun have already been recommended. Recently, they were ordered to submit their resumes and certificates as soon as possible so that they could be transferred to the Customs for appointment. According to Mr. Liu's report, he does not have a formal certificate. Therefore, the Maritime Association recommended Yu Jianfu separately. At the same time, the association submitted a report to the Ministry of Communications, requesting that ship surveyor certificate regulations be formulated and promulgated as soon as possible, following the precedents of various countries, so that qualified Chinese citizens could obtain them in accordance with the regulations and be recommended to various customs offices for appointment. The Shanghai Shipping Association has submitted a report to the Ministry of Communications, and at the same time, submitted the certificates and resumes of Yu, Li, Huang, and Wang to the Customs for recommendation and selection.</p>
<p>Tea Tax Payment Method The Ministry of Finance has agreed to exempt all outstanding tea taxes before 1918 for Chinese tea exports. However, the new tax pledge regulations have been submitted by the Tea Industry Association to be handled in accordance with the guarantee regulations, but approval has not yet been received. As for tea that is transferred to foreign countries, taxes should be paid first, and then the export customs will refund the taxes upon export. For those who have guarantees this year, the tax collection items should also be notified to cancel the guarantee in accordance with the new regulations.</p>
<p>Resolution of Collective Dispute The Shanghai Collective Shipping Company had a labor dispute due to the dismissal of crew members. Both parties requested mediation from the Shipping Association. The association sent Liu Shisun and Wang Yufu, representatives of the Drivers Association, to negotiate. With the consent of both parties, the Collective Company offered 500 yuan from the tugboat fee as compensation for the dismissed captain and first and second mates. The company also issued certificates of good service. The case was concluded and signed.</p>
<p>Negotiating New Tea Room Regulations The Social Affairs Bureau has decided to formulate unified new regulations for the management of tea rooms to eliminate future disputes between labor and management. The bureau sent letters to the China Merchants, Sanbei, Ning Shao, and other steamship companies, requesting that they send the current rules to the bureau. It was scheduled to convene representatives from various steamship companies to the Shipping Association on the 21st to negotiate and formulate new management regulations.</p>
<p>Confirmation of the Xianghe Ship Collision The Jardine Matheson's Xianghe ship, which was going upstream from Shanghai, damaged a small steamship above Jiujiang. All passengers on board were rescued. According to a telegram from Hankou received by the company yesterday, the damaged small ship was stranded on a shallow sandbar on the riverbank at the time. The ship did not sink, so all passengers and crew members were rescued and transported to Hankou by the Xianghe ship. They have now arrived safely. The extent of the damage to the ship is still under investigation.</p>
<p>Li Zhonggong Has Returned to Shanghai The General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company went to Beijing to pay respects to the Chairman to discuss the reorganization of the bureau's affairs. He has now returned to Shanghai and arrived at the bureau. At 9 a.m., he attended the memorial service for the week and reported on his trip to Beijing, stating that the nationalization of the Commercial Bureau has been decided and all implementation methods are being discussed. Regarding the bureau's funds, Mr. Li said that they must be thoroughly reorganized and that those who receive salaries without working will not be allowed to exist.</p>

<p>According to Articles 6, 7, and 85 of the Municipal Organization Law regarding municipal citizen oath registration, a necessary procedure for citizens to obtain municipal citizenship, the Ministry of Interior recently drafted "Regulations for Municipal Citizen Oath Registration" based on the aforementioned articles of the law. These regulations were submitted to and approved by the Executive Yuan for promulgation and are to be universally followed. The municipal government of this port received a dispatch from the Ministry of Interior yesterday transmitting the aforementioned regulations. It immediately ordered all bureaus and district councils to comply. The articles of the regulations are recorded as follows: (Article 1) These regulations are formulated in accordance with the procedures stipulated in Articles 6, 7, and 85 of the Municipal Organization Law. (Article 2) Anyone who possesses the qualifications stipulated in Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the Municipal Organization Law, upon taking an oath and registering, becomes a municipal citizen. (Article 3) Oaths are divided into the following two types: (1) Regular oaths: The ward office investigates qualifications two months before the annual ward residents' meeting and convenes the oath-taking ceremony. (2) Temporary oaths: People may request the ward office to investigate their qualifications at any time and convene an oath-taking ceremony. For the aforementioned temporary oaths, the ward office may choose a date depending on the number of people, but if people need to take the oath quickly due to necessary circumstances, they should request it according to schedule. (Article 4) The oath-taking ceremony is held at the ward office, with the ward head as the chairman. When the ward office has not been established, the aforementioned oath-taking ceremony should be held at the district office, and the chairman is the district head or a designated district assistant. (Article 5) The oath should be made in duplicate (Form 1). First, people go to the ward office to register for verification and personally sign both copies of the oath. The ward office then issues one copy of the oath to be returned at the time of the regular oath-taking ceremony as proof of oath. People who cannot sign may handle it according to Article 2, Paragraph 2 or Paragraph 3 of the General Principles of the Civil Law. (Article 6) During the oath-taking ceremony, personnel from the district office are dispatched to supervise. The procedure is as follows: (1) Everyone stands at attention. (2) Sing the Party anthem.

When the ward office has not been established, the aforementioned registration is handled by the district office. (Article 8) The ward office should create two copies of the citizen roster, submitting one copy to the district office and the other copy, along with the oaths, to the district office for submission to the municipal government for record-keeping. When the ward office has not been established, the aforementioned citizen roster is created in duplicate by the district office, with one copy submitted to the municipal government for record-keeping along with the oaths. The remaining copy is transferred to the ward office for verification when it is established. The oaths and citizen rosters for temporary oaths under Article 3 of these regulations are handled according to the aforementioned two procedures. (Article 9) After registering municipal citizens, if the ward office discovers that they have any of the circumstances listed in Article 6, Paragraph 2 of the Municipal Organization Law, it may, in accordance with the law, petition the district office to request the municipal government to revoke their citizenship, remove their registration, and announce it publicly. (Article 10) After municipal citizens are registered, regardless of which ward they move to within the municipality, they should report to the ward office for notification to the ward office of their new residence (Form 3) for transfer of registration (Form 4). The aforementioned transfer registration involves citizenship rights. (Article 11) When a municipal citizen dies, the ward office should cancel their registration. (Article 12) The ward office should report changes in the circumstances of municipal citizens to the municipal government through the district office on a monthly basis for record-keeping.

<h3 id="e128">Sixth District, Nineteenth Branch Declares 法(french) Sailors' Rampage <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the Nineteenth Branch of the Sixth District of this city issued a declaration against the unreasonable rampage of French sailors, which resulted in the tragic death of boatman Xin Dingchang. "To the newspaper offices and public organizations across the country: Unfortunately, our country has been plagued by internal strife in recent years. Imperialists, relying on unequal treaties as their talisman, run rampant everywhere in our country, killing people like flies. These imperialists have no remorse and are taking advantage of our central government's involvement in the Northwest. Their arrogance is intensifying. For example, on the evening of the 16th of this month, at 7 p.m., Xin Dingchang, a Ningbo native, was rowing sampan number 130, which was moored at the jetty on Weituoma Road, Yangshupu, and then moored between the tenth and twenty-third buoys of the customs there. Two sailors from the French (Chenonceaux) merchant ship hailed Xin's sampan to ferry them to the ship. After the two sailors boarded the ship, they did not pay, so they waited for an hour. Then they saw them board another ship to go ashore. Xin asked them for the fare. Unexpectedly, the sailors had no sense and became extremely impatient. Without any explanation, they dragged Xin, punching and kicking him. Xin was caught off guard and was suddenly knocked into the river, his body sinking to the bottom, resulting in his tragic death. When the sailors saw that they had caused the disaster, they boarded another ship and left, treating the lives of our people as less than chickens and dogs. If our people do not rise up quickly to seek justice, our nation will have no future. The sailors should have tried to rescue Xin when they saw him fall into the river, but they allowed him to drown, which is extremely inhumane. We deeply hope that compatriots across the country will rise up together and pledge to be the diplomatic backup. It is not just for the death of Xin alone, but for the great shame and humiliation of our nation. All the people in this branch are willing to use our utmost determination to achieve the goal of punishing the perpetrators, providing compensation, and issuing an apology. This is our declaration."</p>
<h3 id="e129">Women's Temperance Union Holds Board Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Women's Temperance Association convened a joint meeting of the board of directors and the three committees for saving beggars, managing families, and rejecting drugs at the Da Zhonghua Restaurant on Sichuan Road at 12:00 noon yesterday. More than ten people, including Liu Wang Liming and Cao Fengxiang, attended. Mrs. Ruifen, the president of the American-Feng Bank, also attended. They had lunch first, and the meeting was declared open at 1:00 p.m. First, Mrs. Hu Qibing, the chairman, reported on the donation last year. Then, the following matters were discussed: (1) The case of attending the Canadian World Women's Temperance Union meeting. It was decided that the secretary-general, Wang Liming, would represent the association. (2) Discussion and approval of the regulations of the education institute. (3) Approval of the construction of the Merciful Mother's Dormitory. The design of the Merciful Mother's Dormitory is a bungalow, with a total cost of 1,600 yuan. (4) It was decided that the second National Women's Temperance Representative Conference would be held at the end of March next year. (5) The motion to hire Ms. Shi Yunying as a staff member of the association was approved. Next, Mrs. Ruifen gave a speech on "The Achievements of Prohibition in the United States," which mainly stated that the prohibition in the United States was promoted by the cooperation of the majority of women. Since the implementation of prohibition, political chaos has been avoided, social order has been stabilized, and conflicts between families have been reduced. All of these have good results. People do not have the consumption of addictions, and life is invisibly abundant. Therefore, I sincerely hope that all ethnic groups in the world can implement this and rely on the joint efforts of the women's community. In any case, as long as the purpose is pure and beneficial to society, it will definitely be achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Qingyun Lane Tenants' Association States the Forced Experience <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Qingyun Lane Tenants' Association yesterday copied and published the letter from the lawyer Gao Yi, representing the New Sassoon Company, in response to the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation. It also provided an explanation of the circumstances in which the landlord forced the demolition of the houses, awaiting public judgment. The details are recorded separately as follows: (Lawyer Gao Yi's reply to the Citizens' Federation) "Dear Sirs, I have just received your letter from my client, the New Sassoon Company, regarding the property in Qingyun Lane, and I am writing on its behalf to reply. Upon investigation, the people currently living in the houses in Qingyun Lane are no longer considered tenants but are considered trespassers who are illegally occupying the property. My client has the right to dispose of its property as it sees fit. The words stated in Section 2 of your letter are difficult for my client to acknowledge. However, my client is obviously not responsible for any losses caused by the illegal resistance of the trespassers. As for the final section of your letter, if the trespassers claim to have suffered injustice, they can take any legal steps they wish to deal with it. Since they have not taken legal steps, my client assumes that the trespassers have not suffered any injustice. I am writing to inform you accordingly and hope that you will take note of it." (Statement by the Tenants' Association) "The circumstances of the demolition: On June 26 of this year, the tenants of Qingyun Lane received a notice from the company stating that the houses would be renovated and demanding that all tenants completely move out and return the houses by the end of August. The tenants of our lane then sent representatives to visit the manager of the company and the rental buyer Xing Dingyong, recounting the difficulties the tenants had in moving and voluntarily offering to increase the rent to request that they withdraw the order. At the same time, they requested various organizations to act as mediators. After they left, the company did not express whether it would accept the request or send a final eviction notice. Unexpectedly, on September 10, the tragedy of white Russian thugs injuring people and looting property occurred. Upon investigation, the company did not have a demolition permit or build fences, yet it dared to commit violence in broad daylight. Its intention was nothing more than to expose the hideous face of imperialists who destroy weak nations and despise our country, thinking that even if they trample on China, it can do nothing about it. Furthermore, claiming that the tenants are illegally occupying the property, they can sue in court and request deportation. Now they are using such illegal tactics that disregard international friendship, and Sima Zhao's intentions are revealed. Who would believe that they do not despise our country? The suffering of those personally affected is not worth mentioning, but what about the dignity of our country? Therefore, after careful consideration, both feelings of resentment and pain cannot be mixed up with the dispute between the landlord and the tenants. Therefore, we all have the determination to fight to the death to achieve the goal of seeking redress. In addition to submitting a petition, we have also lodged a serious protest with the authorities against the other party, demanding that they formally apologize to our government and compensate for the losses. We have also announced the circumstances of the victimization and refuted their letter, hoping that people from all walks of life across the country will make a fair judgment. Qingyun Lane Tenants' Association, October 19, 1920."</p>

Compared with the last survey, the number has decreased by more than 1,000. The reason for this is that the recession in Japan has led to most companies and institutions laying off employees and returning to their home country, which has greatly reduced the number of people. Yesterday, the Japanese government officially notified of the verification.</p>

<p>Hoping All Sectors Will Help Revitalize the Manufacturing of Clothing and Floss</p>
<p>The China Jisheng Society in this port believes that it is now late autumn and the severe winter is approaching. The provinces that have been most severely affected by disasters, such as Henan, Shaanxi, Liaoning, and Ningxia, are lacking food in the winter and have no clothes. The wilderness is full of cries of hunger and cold. The society is now rushing to make cotton clothes to be transported for emergency relief. If people from all walks of life have donations and cotton clothes to help revitalize the disaster relief efforts, they are asked to send them to the society as soon as possible so that they can be transported in batches for relief. Clothing floss is always warmer when it is newly made. The severe cold in the north makes old cotton useless. Please pay attention to this.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Overseas Chinese Federation's Telegraph on Aiding the Xiao Case <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Loud Call of the Overseas Chinese Federation</p>
<p>The Whole Nation's Compatriots Unite to Rise</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation, in order to aid the Xiao case, issued an urgent telegraph to the whole nation, stating: "The Java Shipping Company's ship 'Tjibadak' first and second mates forcibly violated our country's female teacher, Ms. Xiao Xin'an. More than a month has passed, and this extraordinary shame has not been avenged. For the sake of the entire nation's honor, for the sake of the entire country's dignity, for the sake of the personality of all female compatriots and the dignity of female teachers, our Federation must loudly call out to compatriots at home and abroad to urgently rise up to aid. The method of aid, besides urging the Party and the government to conduct serious negotiations, urgently requires a united uprising to boycott all ships of the Java Shipping Company (javaChlnaJapanrLyn) as a diplomatic backing. Before the beasts in the 'Tjibadak' first and second mates are severely punished, before the Dutch government formally apologizes to our nation, and before Ms. Xiao receives appropriate compensation, we will never stop. Those bestial first and second mates dared to indulge their lusts towards Ms. Xiao, because in their hearts they no longer consider our people to be human. Therefore, their bestial claws were not directed at Europeans, Americans, or Japanese, but directly at Ms. Xiao, who unfortunately was born Chinese, because they thought that the Chinese were a lowly race, lacking bloodiness, national concept, and national consciousness. Because of our selfishness, individualism, and the public creed of the lowly Chinese, who would be willing to sacrifice a hair to aid Ms. Xiao? Therefore, they dared to call out in packs, again and again, forcing Ms. Xiao to attempt suicide, and still they would not stop. Our Federation does not recognize that our people have this inferior nature. We deeply wish to follow all circles to wash away this extraordinary shame of being despised and forcibly violated. Who does not have a wife and daughter? Who would willingly suffer humiliation? Not aiding the Xiao case, who knows that the next to be violated after Xiao might be one's own wife and daughter? Not punishing the bandits, from then on they will imitate, and what will those bandits fear? Compatriots, united we are strong, divided we are weak. Helping Xiao is helping oneself, helping others is helping oneself. From today onwards, do not take Java Company ships, do not send or receive Java Company goods, do not load or unload Java Company passengers or goods, do not accept or post Java Company advertisements, do not publish Java Shipping import and export news, so that the Dutch recognize that Chinese are not beasts, so that all the world's humans recognize that Chinese are humans, in order to protect national honor, to preserve national dignity, to fight for female personality, to maintain the dignity of female teachers. All depends on this call. The telegraph is filled with sorrow and indignation. We eagerly await righteous voices. The Overseas Chinese Federation bows in awareness. (12A Park Road, Shanghai)"</p>
<h3 id="e140">Wife Escapes, Lawsuit Involved <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Over Fifty Against Twenty-Four</p>
<p>Elder Brother Unjustly Beaten</p>
<p>Women's Association Difficult to Mediate</p>
<p>Guangdong native Jin Dekang, age fifty-four, resides at No. 18, Songbaili, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. He has been working as a scribe at the Xinshichang Foreign Firm on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession for over thirty years. His wife passed away, leaving behind children without care. Therefore, in 1928, he went to a certain hall and obtained a Suzhou woman, Wang Guizhen, as his second wife. The woman is currently twenty-four years old and extremely beautiful. Since entering the household, seeing that Jin was old, although his family wealth was abundant, their marital relationship was ultimately unhappy, leading to frequent conflicts. In December of last year, Guizhen secretly fled her husband. After losing his wife, Jin searched everywhere without any news. Subsequently, his brother, Mr. Jin, who resembled Dekang, one day happened to pass through the French Concession when he was suddenly surrounded by many hooligans. Without distinguishing right from wrong, they brutally assaulted him. Mr. Jin was outnumbered and seriously injured. He immediately returned and told his younger brother Dekang. While they were still puzzled, the next day they suddenly received an anonymous letter, the main point of which was that the beating that day was originally intended for your brother, but they mistakenly identified you, causing you injury. They expressed much apology. Soon after, Dekang also received a phone call at the same time. Listening closely to the accent, it seemed to be from Guizhen, saying, "I am in Shanghai, you don't need to search for me. If you continue to search," then the voice suddenly changed to a man's voice, loudly continuing, "If you continue to search, I will deal with you with a gun. Be careful," and so on. At this point, Dekang finally realized that his brother's assault was actually caused by him. Recalling Guizhen's cruelty, he couldn't help but feel great anger and went to the court to file a lawsuit. Soon, he received a judgment to wait until the defendant was found for further investigation. Unexpectedly, Dekang recently received a notice from the Women's Association stating that Wang Guizhen was currently at the association, requesting assistance in breaking off relations with him. Jin immediately went to the association, intending to reconcile with both parties, but without success. Until yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, Jin went again for negotiations without reaching an agreement. He then called upon Guo Yuling, the guard police officer from the Fifth Post, to bring Wang Guizhen and others to the Third Sub-District of the First District, where the director conducted a preliminary hearing. Jin Dekang explained the situation, and Wang Guizhen stated in her confession that her biological parents' surnames were unknown, but she was raised from a young age by an elderly woman surnamed Wang in Suzhou. Later, the elderly woman, seeing that her appearance was quite good, intended to sell her to a brothel. Hearing this, she refused and threw herself into a hall for care. Three years ago, Jin Dekang, accompanied by another young man, came and claimed that they wanted to take her to England to study, so she was taken out. Later, she realized she had been deceived and had no choice but to escape and seek help from the Women's Association, requesting assistance. The negotiations still had no results, etc. The director ordered that a document be prepared and sent to the Shanghai District Court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Reports to the Police and Intercepts Him</p>
<p>Xing Xiumin, a teacher at the Jianghuai Shanghai Elementary School on Taiyang Temple Road in Zhabei, was wandering along the railway tracks there yesterday afternoon after finishing work when he caught sight of a person walking slowly ahead of him, appearing to be considering something. He looked closer and was shocked to see that the person's appearance closely resembled Lu Jinbao, a well-known bandit from Jiangbei. He immediately reported to the head of the Taiyang Temple Police Station in the Fourth District, who rushed to arrest him and transferred him to headquarters. According to Xing's account, Lu Jinbao was a bandit leader in Funing, Yancheng, and other places in Jiangbei, and had committed several cases of murder and kidnapping. The local authorities had issued a strict arrest warrant. Today, he unexpectedly encountered him on the road. At first, he looked at him repeatedly to confirm, but the person was guilty and tried to hire a car to escape, so he reported it to the police for arrest, etc. In his interrogation, the man denied being Lu Jinbao, claiming his name was Li Zhuoru, a native of Yancheng, who had always been a law-abiding merchant. He vehemently denied the accusations. Headquarters examined the confession and, considering the seriousness of the case, ordered him to be detained for further investigation.</p>

<p>Hangs Himself on a Willow Branch</p>
<p>Branch Breaks and He Falls into the Pond</p>

He had hanged himself from a willow tree with a leather belt and had already fallen into the pond. The local villagers spotted him and reported it to the Sixth District Police Station. The district chief, Director Ren, personally inspected the scene and ordered the local Baojia to report to the District Court for an autopsy. Around 4:00 PM in the afternoon, Prosecutor Guo arrived with the coroner to conduct the autopsy. First, the body was fished out and placed on the bank. It was found that the Japanese man was about twenty-seven or eight years old and had indeed hanged himself from a tree branch with a leather belt, which broke due to its tenderness, causing the body to fall into the pond. His entire body was drenched with water. It was heard that the Japanese man was a training doctor on a certain Japanese warship, twenty-eight years old. He had taken this world-weary action due to some domestic stimulation. The officers of the warship found out and immediately rushed there with the detectives from the Jing'an Temple West Police Station, and then immediately took measures to collect the body and prepare the coffin, etc.</p>

<p>Shanghai South Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, yesterday morning at 7:15 AM, the first-class early passenger train was about to depart, and preparations were being made for the second-class fourth train. Suddenly, a man about forty years old, wearing a black gown and a copper-basin felt hat, with a follower about thirty years old, wearing short clothes and resembling a rickshaw puller, hired a rickshaw carrying an end table (drawing table) and two side tables, wrapped with bamboo strips. After the passenger arrived at the station, he did not purchase a passenger ticket but first moved the end table and side tables to the luggage room to make a ticket. The baggage clerk said that according to the regulations, a passenger ticket was required to make an account. While they were handing over, Wang Zheng, the director of the inspection department dispatched to the station by the Songhu Garrison Command, and the investigating military police, seeing that the end table and side tables looked suspicious, stepped forward to dismantle them. Upon inspection, the end table and side tables were indeed made with false bottoms, hiding a large number of cigarettes, totaling twelve large packages and more than eighty small packages, more than one hundred packages in total, worth about two thousand yuan. The people and goods were detained and reported to the command for handling.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, Zhang Yuhua, who claimed to be a female teacher at the Xiafei Road Art School, went to the home of Li Zhongwen, a translator at the Guomin Newspaper on Shanhai Pass Road, seeking help. Li met with her and, not recognizing her, asked her purpose. She claimed that her elder brother was a classmate of yours at the Dongwu Law School, and now, because her eldest child had died prematurely and her younger child was ill, she wanted to send them to the hospital for treatment. Her husband was far away in another port and lacked funds, so she begged to borrow five yuan temporarily, which she would return as soon as she received her salary. Li listened and, seeing that her clothes were neat and her speech elegant, did not think she was a con artist, so he replied that there were many con artists outside now. If you are in urgent need, you can leave an address, and I will send it to you. Unexpectedly, the woman said that she needed to buy things now. If it was inconvenient, could you temporarily give me two yuan? Li thought the amount was small, so he gave it to her, and told her that this was not because of a classmate's face, but because you are a woman, so I am helping you. Later, Li heard that this woman had gone to Yang Qianli's house seeking help, also seeking assistance in the same way. She was scolded by Yang's eldest son, and the woman left in shame.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Mixing in Counterfeit Fifty-Cent Bills <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Falsely Claiming to Use Money to Redeem Tickets</p>
<p>Bringing Back to the Hometown for Use</p>
<p>The day before yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, Liu Quande, a native of Haimen, mixed in a counterfeit fifty-cent bill at Xu Liqi's cigarette and paper shop at No. 89 Yalü Road, which was detected by Xu. He questioned him, and they quarreled with each other. An Huabu No. 1906 happened to pass by, and after learning the situation, arrested Liu and searched his body, finding 167 similar counterfeit fifty-cent bills and 61 pawn tickets, which were all taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special Zone. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the case, saying that the defendant had confessed at the police station that the counterfeit bills were purchased from someone surnamed Mou on Baoshan Road in the Chinese territory. He then handed over the two counterfeit bills to the Public Security Bureau for investigation of the seller. Xu Liqi also submitted a case report, proving the situation at the time. Interrogated the defendant, who confessed that he came to Shanghai from his hometown only two days ago. Previously, his fellow villager Shi Zi'an was kidnapped by bandits and extorted two thousand yuan for a ransom. He was entrusted by his friend to purchase the above-mentioned counterfeit bills, totaling ten yuan, from someone surnamed Mou on Baoshan Road to bring back to his hometown to pay to the bandits on behalf of Shi. Yesterday, while passing by the plaintiff's shop, he intended to try using the counterfeit bill but was arrested. He asked for judgment. The police lawyer Zhang also stated that a large number of pawn tickets were found from the defendant in the police station. Asked about the inside story, he claimed that he had been unemployed in Shanghai for a year, so he gradually pawned his clothes to make a living. The defendant's confession did not match, and the claim that he wanted to bring the counterfeit bills back to his hometown to pay the bandits was even more nonsense. Judge Feng Shide examined the confession and, after designating lawyer Jiang Baoli as the defendant's pro bono defense, ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody pending sentencing.</p>

Yesterday noon after 12:00 PM, the tea servant saw that he had not yet gotten up. Due to the hotel regulations, he had to knock on the door and call. After several minutes, there was no response, so he tried to pry open the door. He saw that Lin was unconscious and his breathing was weak. A note was left on the table, the content of which was roughly that the world was vast and tasteless, so it was better to go to the underworld early to end this life, etc. He immediately hired a car and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. Because medical treatment was ineffective, he died at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning.</p>

After losing his wife, Zhang investigated from spring to summer, and from summer to autumn, until now, as winter was approaching, he learned that the woman had eloped with Lü Changming and was hiding at No. 2, Junli, Gujiating, Haichao Temple in the South City. Yesterday morning, he filed a complaint at the Third Sub-District of the First District, who dispatched police to assist in arresting Lü. However, after searching everywhere, the woman was nowhere to be found. Later, because he saw that the behavior inside No. 3 next door was suspicious, he went to search again. Unexpectedly, the woman was hiding under the bed, cowering and afraid to make a sound. When the police entered the room to search, the woman panicked, causing a rustling sound like a rat, arousing the police's suspicion. They looked down and saw her curled up inside. They immediately dragged her out and escorted them to the station, and then transferred them to the District Court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Breaks off Family Relations, Gives Two Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Not Allowed to Use Gu's Name, etc.</p>
<p>Gu Jiemin, a gold merchant, is twenty-six years old, from Pinghu, Zhejiang, and does business in Shanghai. In the spring of 1927, he was playing with friends in the brothels and became acquainted with the prostitute Pei Qiaoxian, who is now nineteen years old, from Suzhou. Jiemin and Qiaoxian fell in love at first sight, reported their affection, and became extraordinarily loving after several months. In December of that year, they discussed the silver to redeem her with the madam, paid it, and took her as a concubine, bringing her back to the house, renaming her Gu Pei Qian, courtesy name Suman. The following year (1928), he sent Qiaoxian to study at the Wang's Women's School in this port, where she stayed, only returning home on Sundays. For three years, Qiaoxian was absorbed in social life and liked to be fashionable, and her clothes and jewelry were unusually gorgeous. Subsequently, because Jiemin had parents in the hall, who were old-fashioned, they repeatedly blamed her when they saw this situation. Qiaoxian did not abide by etiquette, and Qiaoxian believed that the current situation was free and equal, and she would not accept despotic control, so disputes arose at this time. A few days ago, a dispute occurred, and Qiaoxian took two boxes of clothes and left, leaving them at her sister's house, and hired a lawyer to negotiate with Jiemin, requesting to break off family relations. It is heard that the negotiations were successful, and the conditions for breaking off family relations included giving her two thousand yuan in cash for Qiaoxian's living expenses, and handing over all clothes and jewelry to Qiaoxian to collect. Lawyer Chen Ying was hired to certify the contract, but after the contract was broken, she was not allowed to use names such as Gu Pei Qian and Su Man.</p>

<p>Cao Qiu is Detained by the Police Station</p>
<p>Chen Meibao, the thirteen-year-old niece of Chen Lin, a woman from Ningbo living at No. 4, Zhufuli, Qiujiang Road, Shanghai North, lost her father early. Her mother came to Shanghai last year due to illness and was treated at Renji Hospital. Later, through the recommendation of Zhang Li, a female missionary of the Jesus Church, Meibao was recommended to learn Western socks at the home of Cao Qiu, an elderly woman from Pudong, at No. 1, Puqingli, Ma Lang Road, French Concession. Unexpectedly, Qiu was fierce, and after Meibao entered her house, it was like entering the gate of hell. If she slightly disobeyed, she would be beaten with rods. Neighbors often heard tragic cries that were unbearable. Unexpectedly, on the 13th of this month, Qiu beat Meibao again, causing injury to her waist. She was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. After the doctor found internal injuries, he operated. However, the injury was serious, and the treatment was ineffective. She died at twelve o'clock that night. The woman did not report to the police station. Just as she was about to buy a coffin for burial, the matter was learned by neighbors, who were very indignant and reported to the police station. Detectives brought Qiu in for questioning. She admitted to beating. The police chief ordered her to be detained and ordered detectives to carry Meibao's body to the Tongren Fuyuantang autopsy station, and reported to Judge Zhu Cheng of the French Public Concession Court to conduct an autopsy, ordering the police station to select a Western doctor for examination. Because the deceased's family was poor, the church member Zhang Qilin prepared a coffin for burial on their behalf, pending verification. Yesterday, the police station sent Qiu to the French Public Concession Court for investigation. First, the police chief reported that the Western doctor had examined Meibao's body and found bruises all over her body, and that the intestines in her abdomen were pierced, proving that the woman had been beaten too much by the defendant before her death. The examination report was submitted for inspection. Witnesses Zhu Jingqing and Wang Shuofu testified that they had heard beating sounds and Meibao's crying sounds from Qiu's room when they lived with Qiu, and that they reported it to the police station out of indignation. Interrogated Cao Qiu, who confessed that Meibao was recommended by Zhang Li to learn to weave Western socks. Because she was stupid, Cao Yuzhen, the woman's daughter, slightly blamed her. The rest of her confession was evasive. The Chinese and Western officials ordered Qiu to be remanded in custody pending further investigation.</p>

The detectives reported back to the police chief, who notified Tongren Fuyuantang to provide a coffin for burial and to place the body in the altar for relatives to claim.</p>

<p>Where is Zhang Ronggui from Qingjiang?</p>
<p>Zhang Ronggui, a native of Qingjiang, age fifty-eight, was a chicken vendor. Zhang came to Shanghai from his hometown on the 14th of this month to sell chickens. After selling the goods, he stayed at the Deyuan Chicken Shop in Laotaiping Lane, Shiliupu. He suddenly suffered a nervous breakdown, crying and laughing erratically all day long, due to some unknown stimulus. On the 18th, his companion intended to send him back to his hometown, but Zhang ran wildly midway, shouting for help. The police on duty heard it and rushed over and took Zhang to the First District Headquarters. After questioning, they ordered him to be released on bail, ordering him to be properly guarded. Unexpectedly, Zhang suddenly disappeared the day before yesterday morning. His companions searched everywhere without finding him. Fearing that he was mentally deranged or that something unexpected might have happened, they reported to the water and land agencies yesterday, asking them to pay attention.</p>

<p>Xu Liansheng and Others Separately Imprisoned</p>
<p>Shen Zhu, a woman from Shaoxing residing at No. 2018, Xinzha Road, and her eighteen-year-old daughter Shen Azhen, were attacked by Azhen's lover Zhu Zhongrong, together with Xu Liansheng, Wang Weixiang, Zhang Huangguang, Li Zigang, Chen Ruilin, Yang Liubao, etc., using硝水 at their home on the afternoon of the 5th of this month, splashing it all over Azhen's face, causing serious injuries, and Shen Zhu's face was also affected. The case was reported to the Xinzha Police Station, who dispatched detectives Zhang Ankang to arrest Xu and the other six people, while Zhu Zhongrong was on the run. They were sent to the Special Zone Court for interrogation and imprisonment, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the date for the continued interrogation arrived. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that the main culprit in this case, Zhu Zhongrong, had still not been apprehended, and the injured Shen Azhen had not yet recovered and was still in the hospital. However, according to the previous order, the defendants were sent to the hospital to examine whether they had any caustic soda scars on their bodies. The police have now had the doctor examine them and found that the defendants Wang Weixiang and Chen Ruilin both had caustic soda scars on their arms and faces, presumably because they were affected when they were pouring the caustic soda. Interrogated the defendants, whose confessions were evasive. Judge Wu Tingqi examined the confession and pronounced the judgment in court, sentencing Xu Liansheng to four years of imprisonment, Wang Weixiang and Zhang Huangguang to three years of imprisonment each, and the remaining Li, Chen, and Yang to six months of imprisonment each.</p>

<p>Cai Furen from Huzhou, due to assembling a gang and holding weapons to kidnap a Mr. Ma's child for a hefty ransom around February 15th of this year in his hometown, fled to Shanghai. Previously, Detective Ding Yugao of the Hongkou Police Station, in collaboration with detectives from the local security team in Huzhou, apprehended Cai on Wusong Road. The Special District Court took custody. As the security team's detectives learned of Cai's escape to Shanghai and tracked him down, they hastily brought him without official transfer documents. Upon instruction, Cai Furen was returned to custody pending further action. Yesterday morning, Tian Ziliang, a member of the Second Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Government Security Team, submitted an official letter to the Third Tribunal of the Special Court, requesting Cai's transfer. However, Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated that the police station had no objection to Cai Furen's transfer.

<h3 id="e162">Case of British-Swiss Company Filing Charges for Selling Counterfeit Milk <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Bao Maokun Released on Bail, Available for Summons</p>
<p>The head Westerner of the British-Swiss Condensed Milk Company recently discovered that inferior milk was being sold on the market, fraudulently using the company's Eagle Brand milk, at low prices. A detailed investigation revealed that Limin Company, located at 910 Avenue Edward VII, was selling this counterfeit milk. The method of counterfeiting involved Bao Maokun, the owner of Limin Company, purchasing Iron Anchor brand milk from the Lixin Foreign Firm on Peking Road for nineteen yuan per case. He would then remove the Iron Anchor trademark and label, replacing it with the Dapeng (Roc) brand. The Roc brand's logo also featured an eagle, making it difficult to distinguish at a glance due to the similarity between "eagle" and "roc." The selling price per case was increased by two yuan. However, genuine Eagle Brand milk cost twenty-six to twenty-seven taels of silver per case, while Bao only sold it for twenty-one yuan, severely impacting legitimate business. Therefore, the New Gate Police Station was informed, which in turn reported to the Special District Court. A search warrant was issued, and two days ago, Western Detective H. Ellis and Chinese Detective Gao Yanrong went to Limin Company and seized several thousand Dapeng Brand eagle trademark papers. These were taken to the police station and forwarded to the Special Court for instructions yesterday morning. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, presented the case, stating that the police station would file a separate lawsuit against Bao Maokun. Bao was already present, so he asked the court to review the evidence. Bao then stated that the milk sold by his company was Dapeng Brand, not Eagle Brand. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Wu Tingqi ordered Bao to be released on bail and available for summons, pending a rescheduled hearing.</p>

<p>To the Editor: Regarding the news about the problem at the National Goods Emporium reported in your newspaper's local news section yesterday (the 19th), although the original article was translated from The Times, the facts are slightly inaccurate. The incident occurred because the party contracting the amusement section on the second floor of our emporium (i.e., the Hua Hua World) did not comply with the regulations regarding the dimensions of the stage, which led to criticism from the Municipal Council. The contractor has now made corrections in accordance with the regulations. Our emporium continues to operate as usual and there are no problems. We are writing to you to request a correction to avoid misunderstandings among the public. Thank you very much. Sincerely, the China National Products United Emporium, October 20th.</p>
<p>To the Editor: Having read the local news section of your newspaper today, concerning the article "Merchant Zhang Zuotang Engaged in Litigation Solicitation," it is stated that Zhang Zuotang is my assistant, which is not true. My office has no position as an assistant, nor is there any Zhang Zuotang employed here. I am writing to request that you correct this matter. Sincerely, Feng Kan, October 20th.</p>
<p>To the Editor: Having read the article "Difficulties for Chinese Citizens Going Abroad" in the local news section of your newspaper on the 20th, there is a sentence stating "National Government Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee Member Lin Youren." I have never served as a member of this committee. I believe this is a mistake in the report and I urgently request your newspaper to make a correction to avoid misunderstandings. Thank you very much. Respectfully, Lin Youren, October 20th, 7 AM.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Characters Similar to Autumn Crickets and Autumn Swallows <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Inkstone Old Man</p>
<p>Peiping, 11th Special Dispatch: Someone from Shijiazhuang said that Yan Xishan in Huolu has dug a tunnel connecting three gates, with air vents on top covered with dry grass to blend in with the ground. I say this is similar to crickets after the Cold Dew season. Crickets fear the cold, so they dig holes in the ground, with two or three openings for both avoiding the cold and allowing air to circulate, as well as facilitating entry and exit. The entrance to the hole is often covered with dry grass. Moreover, crickets like to fight. When defeated, they flee into the hole and dare not come out. Yan today is very similar.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: Yan told Wang that if he couldn't maintain things within two weeks, they would go abroad together, and said that you and Chen (Gongbo), Zou, Xie, Tan, and Mao were all invited by me. Mao is fully responsible for the expenses of going abroad. Chen Gongbo advocated preparing airplanes and, if necessary, flying to Kulun and taking a boat to France via Vladivostok. I say this is similar to swallows after the Autumn Equinox, flocking to the sea. Swallows work hard, carrying mud to build nests. Unfortunately, once the opportunity is gone, even if they are reluctant to leave, they cannot. Thinking back to the double-perched kingfisher beams, whispering to each other, how happy they were. Once hastily flying away, how can they not feel the difference between then and now? Today, Yan, Wang, Chen, and others will inevitably take the plane together with their wives, entrusting themselves to foreign lands. Is it not similar to the autumn swallows perching on the kingfisher beams, leaving their old nests and flying to the sea?</p>
<p>Inkstone Old Man jokingly offers a poem: "The Autumn Equinox and Cold Dew seasons are approaching too closely. Crickets hibernate in caves, pitifully entering traps. Swallows fly over the sea, chirping silently. Humans and animals can learn from each other. Not releasing the butcher's knife, one eventually loses the great power. If only they regretted it in the beginning, it's a pity it's too late to argue."</p>
<h3 id="e178">Talking About Japanese Rice <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Yellow Shadow Dull</p>
<p>Japan is an industrial country in the Far East. It does not produce much agricultural product. Most of its people's rice is imported from other countries. Now suddenly a large amount of Japanese rice is being shipped to various countries for sale. How can we not be surprised? In fact, Japan having surplus rice to sell to other countries is also a first in history. There are two major reasons why Japan has surplus rice for sale this time. One is that for years, in order to maintain rice prices, it has accumulated too much rice. The other is that this year's harvest has been abundant, with the new rice crop being twice as large as in previous years. Therefore, under these circumstances, the Japanese authorities have decided to ship the surplus rice abroad for sale. According to the planned destination, it includes China, the Dutch East Indies, the Near East, England, Germany, and other countries. Since the news came out, Japanese rice merchants engaged in import and export have flocked to volunteer for transportation.</p>
<p>Moreover, Japanese merchants have various favorable conditions when transporting rice this time. Whether the Japanese rice can be sold to various countries is difficult to determine in advance. Therefore, the authorities have promised that if the rice merchants suffer losses, the government will bear the responsibility. The purpose of exporting Japanese rice is to maintain domestic rice prices and protect the interests of farmers. If there is too much rice, the price will inevitably fall. It can be seen that the Japanese government has been making efforts to encourage agriculture in recent years. The sales of Japanese rice are mostly in Java, with an annual capacity of 2,000,000 dan. As for those dependent on the Dutch East Indies, there are 4,000,000 dan. The Japanese government has now decided to increase import tariffs to resist the import of rice. This matter has a great impact on rice importers in Japan.</p>
<p>Regarding the United Kingdom, the various procedures for shipping rice have now been fully determined. Most of the rice shipped by the Japanese government this time is old rice stored in granaries for many years. When shipping it to various countries, there is no fixed price standard. The only purpose is to seek balance based on market prices in various countries. As for the losses suffered, no matter how large or small, they can be ignored. Therefore, in the end, the government will inevitably suffer heavy losses. The Japanese government currently has 2,600,000,020 dan of old rice. The amount to be exported this time is estimated at 3,000,000 dan, with old rice accounting for eight-tenths of it. Its low quality is conceivable. The first time Japan exported rice was in 1914, with only 130,000 dan. The last time was in 1928, with only 500,000 dan, and it was transported privately by merchants. Most of it was imported foreign rice that had been hoarded. Therefore, the amount transported this time is unprecedented, and it is not entirely pure Japanese rice.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Let Me Talk About Cheng Yanqiu <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Zhifan</p>
<p>Recently, I accompanied my old wife and granddaughter on a trip to Tonglu, boating on the Seven Li Tan and climbing Yan Ziling's Fishing Platform. I was deeply impressed in my old age. On the return trip, I passed through Shanghai and was invited by my fellow villagers Qu and Cheng to the Grand Stage to watch Yanqiu perform a play. That evening, they performed "Rainbow Seizing" and "Wu Family Slope." His expression was delicate, and the supporting actors Wang Shaolou and Furong Cao were also good. The audience has their own evaluation. Seeing many couplets hanging in front of the stage, a friend praised Yanqiu's beauty and said that all the couplets could be used. He asked me to write a couplet that was definitely masculine and explicitly embedded the words "Yanqiu." After a brief thought, I replied that it was possible. I recalled a geisha named Qiu Zi whom I met in Dongying twenty-six years ago. She was also very beautiful. So I improvised a couplet to tell him: "I regret bringing a beautiful wife, fearing that she will be captivated at first sight and dislike me from now on. Recalling Qiu Zi's beauty, I realized that the two are of different genders. Why only think of her?" My wife is already sixty years old. How can she be considered a beautiful wife? I don't know if the poem "beautiful wife" does not refer to youth and beauty but mainly to someone capable of fanning emotions. So why is my old wife not capable of it? My friend pointed to a plaque hanging in the box with the words "No Dan Doesn't Cheng's Tune." The best. I looked at its right. Both plaques were mediocre. Further to the right, there were four words that were very appropriate. These four words were posted high on the wall, saying "Partial Head Pain." It can be interpreted as the audience sitting in the main hall but slightly off-center, which causes discomfort in the brain and a headache. I asked the audience if this was true. (In response)</p>
<p>Cuckoo's note: Mr. Zhifan is a famous old scholar from Yushan. He once presided over the Xin Shenbao pen management in this city. He suffered from a car accident, created a foot, and then returned home and never came out again. He is naturally humorous and likes to dig at himself. Reading this article, you can see this old man's humor.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Record of Tianning Temple <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Boying</p>
<p>Tianning Temple is one of the large temples in Jiangnan. The temple is located outside the east gate of Changzhou, covering hundreds of acres. There are more than a thousand monks. Entering the temple, it is impossible to visit it all in a few days. When asked how many rooms there are in the temple, some say there is a number in the thousands. Although exaggerated, no one knows the exact number. The temple has shops selling all kinds of goods. Nothing needs to be sought outside. The wok for cooking rice is cast in copper and is so deep that one person can stand in it. It is hung from the beam with a rope and raised and lowered with a pulley. The main hall is very tall and steep. Looking up, it seems to have no roof. The Buddha statue is also unusually great. Legend has it that there is a gourd on the ridge of the hall, cast in pure copper, which can prevent wind and dust from affecting the area within two miles. The temple is rich. Jiang Wu, a bandit from Bailong Mountain, asked the monks to borrow silver. The monks refused. Jiang Wu said, "I will definitely take your gourd away within three days. Don't regret it." After Jiang Wu left, there were many monks in the temple with good skills. They watched him every day. On the third day, like a bird passing by, the gourd was lost. The monks chased after him in a group. After several miles, only two monks caught up. They fought, but there was no victory or defeat. Jiang Wu was tired and abandoned the gourd in the river. The two monks were ashamed and did not return. Today, there are still many skilled fighters in the temple, and the head monk of the kitchen is the most skilled. The temple makes and sells medicinal wine, which can cure madness and is quite effective.</p>

<p>Solitary Night</p>
<p>A solitary night's mood connects to the distant and indistinct.  I idly count the shooting stars through the pearly blinds. The lamp's flame flickers as if smiling. The rain on the eaves murmurs incessantly. I only lament that the fragrant blossoms are fading into twilight. Secretly, I add my own haggardness to the loneliness. The dawn bell shatters the moon through the gauze window. The quiet words still trouble me, listening in my dreams.</p>
<p>Requesting an inscription for Mr. Buddha Proof's painting "Old Man Liu Weaving Scripture in New Year"</p>
<p>Old Liu's wondrous ink manifests the splendor of Hua.  In his chamber, his practice remains, though he has not left the household.  Planning his mother's care relies on the palm-leaf scriptures. The New Year's scene is adorned with plum blossoms.  His heart's devotion to repaying kindness reveres the distant India. The clouds of dedication connect to Potalaka. Don't say that enlightenment comes before or after. The supreme vehicle ultimately belongs to the white bullock cart.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Roman Art Study Notes (I) <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>This time, I am studying the new and old art of Italy. In late April, I first arrived in Milan from Switzerland. I viewed Vinoi's famous work "The Last Supper." Then, from Milan, I went to Florence. From Florence, I passed through various scenic spots and finally arrived in Rome. I spent two weeks in Rome, enjoying daily excursions. The abundance of historical relics is truly the best in the world. Ancient Rome's artistic prosperity had reached its peak. Although the culture of various European countries originated in Greece, it was first transplanted to Rome, forming a major characteristic of ancient Roman stone architecture. As for religious art, it can be said that it all originated in Rome. It reached a special glory during the Renaissance in the fifteenth century. Therefore, the relics left today truly allow us to explore endlessly. I will briefly record the relics of Rome below.</p>
<p>(1) St. Paul's Cathedral: Rome has more than three hundred churches. The largest are St. Peter's and St. Paul's. This church is magnificently built. Its dome can be seen from a distance. Outside the church is a large open space. The space is surrounded by one hundred and twenty marble pillars. This church was destroyed by fire sixty years ago. It was rebuilt after the fire. It has been fifty years since its completion. The interior of the church is entirely inlaid with colored marble. There are many mosaics made of small colored marble squares. The religious paintings displayed in the church are mosaics made from Raphael's famous works, which are the same color as the original paintings. The precision of the inlay work is unparalleled. The dome and surrounding areas of the church's main hall are also inlaid with fine stones, including portraits of past great clergy. The pupils of one statue of St. Paul are made of diamonds. Looking up, their light shines in all directions. According to those in the know, the windows installed throughout the hall used eighteen trillion lire. (An Italian currency, each lira equals 14 cents in Chinese currency.) The spaces between the windows are made of thin slices of five-colored marble instead of glass. The stone is thin and translucent when exposed to light. The stone grain is fully exposed. The natural patterns of the stone grain are utilized, and each piece has a different pattern. Countless amounts of marble were used to obtain the patterns for these windows at the time. Roman church architecture spares no expense. It only seeks exquisiteness. Therefore, everything displayed inside the church is a precious work of art.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen: Tears Shed in All Directions, Mourning Red Affection; Hearts Enthralled in One Place, Lingering Green Sentiment</p>
<p>Let's talk about Zuo Shichen in the Emerald Bamboo Dressing Pavilion. Holding a crab and facing chrysanthemums, he was listening to Emerald Bamboo tell the tragic history of her little sister, Hong Lianxiang, after she married. To know the ins and outs of something, even when people came to urge Emerald Bamboo to sing her turn, he wouldn't let her go. He said it wouldn't be too late to go on stage after she finished telling the whole story. If you were in a hurry, you could have her tell it simply. But that Miss Emerald Bamboo was good at narrating. When she told a story, she had to start from the beginning, not omitting any details. People say, "To talk about burning a cloth shirt, you have to start from planting cotton." That Emerald Bamboo girl was much like this. Now, she was talking about that Mrs. Yin. Taking advantage of the master not being at home, she interrogated the coachman, Gengsheng. She thought Gengsheng was the person closest to the master. Wherever the master went, Gengsheng went. There couldn't be any mistakes. It was like finding a pearl in the mud. The other day, he inadvertently let out the words "the First Madam." That was the biggest loophole. She caught him then and asked him. Although he argued strongly, his face was already flushed red. It was obvious that he was being evasive. It was like examining examination papers, slowly examining them to find the problems. Haste doesn't make waste. If you pursue it too quickly, things might change. So she let him off then. Three or four days later, the master really did go out. As soon as the master went out, Gengsheng had a lot more free time. So the madam called him in and calmly questioned him. Like writing an essay, she first flattered him. If that method didn't work, she would use another method. Who knew that Gengsheng was ultimately a simple man? Mrs. Yin flattered him, and he came out with it. He even blamed his master in his heart. Why was he so honest? He told people not to reveal it, but he himself told the madam. In fact, Gengsheng had been tricked. Saying there was no Third Madam was like admitting that there was a Second Madam. He even thought he was smarter than his master. Mrs. Yin saw that this flattery had been effective. She then used the skill of oblique attacks. It's a pity that today's prosecutors didn't send an apprenticeship invitation to Mrs. Yin. They would definitely benefit greatly. Generally, to question someone and get a confession, you can't do it with carelessness and impatience. As for the interrogations of detectives, they are even more like blindly sticking needles, only causing people to suffer more. If you ask slowly, you will eventually get the truth. That day, the madam also said, "The master has already agreed to move the Second Madam into the mansion. It will probably be implemented after the master returns, after the confinement period. We have to clear out a room. I wonder if she has a lot of furniture." When the madam said this, she thought that since the master had taken a mistress outside, it must be mahogany furniture, foreign furniture. Needless to say, a lot of money must have been spent. So she tested Gengsheng's tone. As long as he said the furniture was more or less, it would prove that she had bought furniture. Who knew that Gengsheng only answered with a few "yes"s, not continuing the sentence.</p>
<p>Correction: Yesterday's "Warmth on My Mind" should have been the beginning of Chapter Fifteen. "297" was mistakenly printed as "298." Now, we are specifically reprinting "297." Readers, please exchange this with what was printed in yesterday's newspaper to read this announcement.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Financial and Gold Markets are Confusing and Uncertain <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Seemingly Containing a Slight Upward Trend: Yesterday, the gold price seemed to be slightly increasing, but the situation was confusing, rising and falling suddenly, making it difficult to grasp. In general, people's hearts were floating and uncertain. There were two or three twists and turns. The entire market had a difference of about five taels. The silver market, which was slightly low in the early morning, did not shrink, unmoved. Later, Yuanxingyong, Yuanmaoyong, Cuitaichengyong, Yongfeng, and others bought in, and the shorts took advantage of this to enter. Furthermore, the draft was strong, the listing price was reduced by half a level, so it frequently rose, feeling quite sharp, rising by five taels, and actually breaking through seventy-five taels. Afterwards, although foreign exchange brokers were agile, the bank's supply was excessive, so industry insiders changed their strategy. Yuanxingyong, Yongfeng, Taikangrun, Yuanmaoyong, and others sold off, which was hedging drafts. The gold price suddenly turned downward, falling sharply by more than five taels, and actually breaking seventy taels. After the market, Wanxingshunli, Yuancheng, Yong, and others bought in. Yu Datakungrun Xietai, and others were inconsistent in their transactions, and the price fluctuated constantly, moving around seventy taels. In general, people's minds were changing. Today, the overseas silver market may not have large fluctuations, or it may be slightly lower.</p>
<p>Sharp Drop in the Morning: The opening price of the gold price for December at 8:55 am was 571 taels and 6 mace, an increase of one tael. (The gross price was shouted at 69 taels, returning to 71 taels). The large size was low by 1.25, and the silver price was only 0.25. The European market was flat, so people's minds were flat. Later, large firms made up for their positions, and outsiders also bought, so it had already risen. At 9:15 am, it was 74 taels and 2 or 3 mace. Foreign exchange was also firm. In December, Toyo was sold by Mitsui for 2 taels, 2 mace, 6 fen, and 5 li, then 7 fen. Sumitomo also issued 173125 January British gold. Then, Huabi issued 3125 December, and Taikangrun Zhifengyong sold it, immediately retreating one tael. The first decree was announced as 72 taels, 7 or 8 mace. Although the listing price was reduced by 1 or 2.25 US dollars and 0.25 Japanese gold increased by one fen, the gold price was flat, only counting 73 taels. By 10 o'clock, there were many sellers on the floor, so it fell to 71 taels, 1 or 2 mace. Afterwards, various numbers increased their positions. British gold banks such as Huabi, Xingye, and Maccary all sold 17375 to 3125 December. Then, it could not be closed much, and it seemed to be tightening. Yuanxingyong Tafen Yong Yongfeng Yuancheng Yong and others competed to buy, so it surged four taels in half an hour, reaching 75 taels and 2 mace by 10:30 am. Later, all banks were willing to sell, counting 174375 to 375 for January. The hedgers, seeing that the gold price was high and could still be calculated, sold off their strips, such as Yuanxingyong, Taikangrun, Xieyu Yongfeng, and others, so the price was suppressed by 4 or 5 mace. However, there were occasional rises and falls of two taels until it suddenly fell to 69 taels and 5 mace at 11:45 am. The low price and retail investors pursued purchases, pulling up more than one tael. The noon closing price was 70 taels and 5 mace, and then it was made to 70 taels. The announced price has been changed to 618 taels and 6 mace, which is one minute higher for Japanese gold, counting 46 taels to 43 taels. The noon closing was 41 taels.</p>
<p>Unstable Evening Market: The afternoon market opened at 71 taels and 1. Later, it returned to 70 taels and 4 mace, and Zhifengyong sold it. Suddenly, it had broken through more than one tael, to 71 taels, 7 or 8 mace, because Chengfengyong and Dalian helped buy in. Later, Yu Da sold it to only 69 taels and 7 mace by 2:45. After that, there was a difference of one tael up and down. After 3 o'clock, Yuanxingyong Xieyu and hedgers bought in, so one or three taels, reaching 72 taels and 7 mace by 3:20. The British gold to be settled was not negligent. Maccary Shanghai and others had sold 17375 December. Taiwan absorbed 1 tael 2 mace 6 fen 5 li from Toyo in the near term. Later, the offers to sell short on the floor seemed lively. Xieyu and others all issued, so it fell again by two taels, but there was a fluctuation of one tael, and the trend became chaotic again, and people's minds were floating. At 4:20, it was 70 taels and 7 mace, and in an instant it had raised again by more than one tael. The closing price at 4:30 was 72 taels, an increase of 1 tael and 4 mace compared to last Saturday. After entering, it was suppressed by a small amount. The maximum price for the day was 75 taels and 2 mace, and the minimum price was 69 taels and 5 mace, a difference of 5 taels and 7 mace. The goods opened two and a half cents early, zero three cents at noon closing, 1 tael and 1 mace in the afternoon, and 1 tael and 7 mace at the closing. The declared price was 47 taels.</p>
<p>Different Entries and Exits Among Peers: The transactions of each number were different and inconsistent, but there were no large transactions. Fengyong, Jinan, Cuitai, Yuanxingyong, Yongfeng, and others entered and then exited. Yuanmaoyong, Yu Da, Dadecheng, Shunli, and Wanxing were numerous, sometimes entering and sometimes exiting. In general, the supply was greater than the demand. Fuyu, Yuancheng, Neixing, and general inexperienced shorts all resisted entering. Hengxing, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Hanheng, and Taikangrun all sold off. The entry and exit of goods were inconsistent. In the afternoon, Chengfengyong, Yuancheng, Shunli, and Wanxing all entered. Taikangrun, Zhifengyong, Yu Da, and others occasionally had entries and exits. Hengxing, Chunfayong slightly exited. Dalian helped sell a total of 1400 or 500 strips, then entered more than 1000 strips. Guang helped sell only a few hundred strips.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Foreign Exchange in Steady State <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC listed, and all exchanges have been reduced by half a level. The trend of shrinking in the overseas silver market the day before yesterday was calculated as British gold shrinking by 1.25, currently being one shilling and seven pence, 1.25. British gold shrunk by 0.25, counting 38 yuan and 75 cents. Indian exchange decreased by half a yuan, counting 107 rupees and 25 cents. French exchange shrank by six yuan, counting 987 yuan. The Japanese exchange decreased by half a yuan, counting 96 shields. Singapore exchange increased by 0.75, counting 146 taels. The Hong Kong exchange did not change, still being 82 taels. German exchange had shrunk to 162 marks and 5. As for the domestic market, it was still flat at the beginning of the morning, then it seemed tight. It recovered at noon, and it was stable in the afternoon. Chinese merchants had a lot of closing, and British gold used hedging strips. Because the gold price had risen, it was still appropriate, leaving about 20 taels, sometimes 29 taels. As for the fluctuating gold price, the market situation was elusive, with a difference of more than five taels throughout the day. Hengxing Yufengyong Taikangrun and Dalian helped buy a total of more than 400,000 pounds. Banks were willing to sell, including Shanghai Huabi, Sumitomo, Xingye, Maccary, and Dongya. The various exchanges also made more than 200,000 yuan, and the Japanese gold was settled by the gold industry for several hundred thousand yuan. Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Huabi, and others all sold. In the afternoon, Dalian sold tens of thousands of yuan, and Mitsui Huabi Taiwan and others absorbed it. In the end, each exchange was compared to last Saturday, with British gold not being very different, the US dollar shrinking slightly by 1.25, and the Japanese gold increasing by 0.25. The market atmosphere seemed stable.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Banks Tighten and Then Loosen <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday was also the same period, and the procedures seemed slightly more complicated, but the transactions were mostly quiet, with no great need. As for the various market prices, the silver base was still restored. In addition, foreign cents and the currency were as stable as before. However, long-term settlements were quite busy, but most of them were transfer procedures, with no great relationship.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices: The "foreign cent" interest rate in the morning market was 7 cents, 2 minutes, 7 li, and 2 hao and a half. The noon market was 7 cents, 2 minutes, 6 li, 2 hao, and 7 suddenly and a half. The result was similar to the day before. The "silver cent" was 1 mace and 2 fen in the morning market, and 6 fen in the noon market. The market atmosphere was still loose. The bank listed at 5 fen, and the floating interest was 6 or 7 fen.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Long-Term News Summary <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Recently, it is the time for the expiration and replacement of long-term funds. Yesterday's news: (1) In the Ningbo financial community, the number of long-term funds deposited in Shanghai for lending is very high, estimated to be more than 20 million. According to the usual practice, they must continue to be made. In this session, because the deposits of each village are crowded, especially in Fenghua, there are even more deposits. Therefore, this long-term loan not only has no possibility of being collected, but instead has a huge increase. According to investigations from various aspects, the total amount will reach 30 million. (2) The total amount of funds expiring yesterday was about 7 million. More than half of the accounts transferred funds for several days. The specified interest price ranged from 8.5 to 10.05, among which the interest price varied due to the account's quality and different gangs. (3) More than 1 million of the expired funds of various domestic gangs were recovered, tens of thousands of were transferred, and tens of thousands were made in new transactions. The interest rate was around 9. (4) The expired amount of the Hankou gang was also several million. A general agreement has been reached that most of them will transfer accounts, but the interest rate will be determined when it expires. (5) For long-term deposits, old accounts are mostly transferred. New transactions are secretly traded with each other, so the outside world rarely knows. However, the total amount is even larger and cannot be estimated.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Securities and Bond Prices Hover and Rise Slightly <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, only the current bonds of the Compilation and Nineteenth Year cigarette tax were issued, and there were no other transactions. The futures market was flat, with 4.9 million yuan being issued in the morning and more than 3.6 million yuan in the afternoon. Although the trend of each bond was that investment purchases were more active and rebounded in unison compared to the previous weekend, large firms still had few large transactions, and the trend continued to be quite stable, with both the front and rear markets falling and rising by a few corners. As a result, the 19th Customs, Demobilization, and Post-Disaster Customs duties each rose by about half a yuan, and the others also rose slightly by 2 or 3 corners. The total daily spot transactions were only 8,000 yuan, and futures totaled 8.58 million.</p>

<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell back in the afternoon, but actual sales remained flat, and various gangs still had no energy. Therefore, people's minds were normal, and some manufacturers maintained a buy-on-dip attitude. If it can be stabilized, there will be no action, so there has been no entry or exit. However, judging from the overall situation, it is difficult for the market to rise, because demand is not smooth, and the bottom goods will inevitably increase day by day. Therefore, Japanese merchants have not given up the idea of selling short. It is difficult to predict what will happen in the future.</p>
<p>Human Standard Slightly Harder: The opening market of the human standard was flat for foreign cotton, and the market was slightly tired, with each falling 2 or 3. The market was strong due to the firmness and high price of raw cotton, and buying enthusiasm was high. The markets rebounded and rose, resulting in each month rising 5, 7, or 8 cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that sales of current yarn were not strong and the situation was loose, each falling 2 or 3 cents. The total number of transactions for the day was 14,800 packages. It was found that Yiyu sold 1,350 packages, Shenyu 1,050 packages, Senkang 700 packages, and the remaining 4 or 500 packages. Yuantai bought 1,600 packages and the others 3, 5, or 100 packages. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>December 149 5 5 41,900 March 1502 5 14,400</p>
<p>Sales of current yarn remain flat. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 1,735 packages throughout the day, with 700 packages entering the same industry. The market was flat. Customer gangs included 290 packages from Sichuan, 360 packages from inland areas, 140 packages from Shantou, 90 packages from Guangdong, 350 packages from Hankou, 60 packages from Changsha, and 145 packages from miscellaneous gangs.</p>

<p>The cotton market rose slightly because the US cotton rose and fell, and the situation was flat. However, the exchange rate changed slightly, causing bulls to actively buy, and the market lacked sellers, so the market became tense. However, because the shipment from Hankou was more active, the market price fell, so some Hankou gangs sold in large quantities in recent months. It was heard that Ningbo bought a lot. At the afternoon closing, the price fell, and the current cotton of each factory in China and abroad was not needed, so when the market price was high, sellers rushed to come, but Gongtai bought more than 6,000 dan.</p>
<p>Han Standard Closing is Flat Again: At the opening market of the Han Standard, the US cotton was flat, there were more buyers, and the situation was particularly tight. Each month rose 2 or 3 cents, but the Han gang sold in recent months, and the market was slightly flat. The opening market in the afternoon was still tight. The 2nd and 3rd markets were tired due to the discontinuation of current cotton transactions, and each fell 1 cent to 1.5 cents. The total number of transactions for the day was 54,200 dan. It was found that Shenchang sold 6,500 dan, Tianchang 4,800 dan, Tianlong 2,800 dan, Maoji 2,500 dan, and the remaining 1 or 2,000 dan. Gongtai bought 7,800 packages, Dafu 3,800 dan, Yu Chang 3,500 dan, and Tongxing 4,100 dan. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<h3 id="e192">A Week's Observation of the Yarn Market <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Raw Yarn... Environmental Deterioration Offers No Force for Price Increase</p>
<p>Spot Yarn... Demand is Quiet, Thick with Pessimistic Color</p>
<p>Last week, cotton yarns and actual sales became increasingly sluggish, with no vitality in any sector. This was due to financial weakness, resulting in weak purchasing power across all groups, coupled with the sluggish state of the global economy, leading to stagnant transactions. While many held an optimistic view of the situation, hoping for an improvement in demand, the prolonged war has depleted the vitality of various localities, making a swift recovery difficult. Furthermore, rampant banditry has deterred any excitement among various groups, resulting in an abnormally depressed market. The Chaozhou group and Japanese merchants showed a strong inclination to sell off their holdings. However, one factory bucked the trend and purchased a significant volume when prices fell. Nevertheless, it is difficult for a lone tree to support a tilting building against the prevailing trend. In summary, sluggish actual demand and the weakness of the global cotton industry indicate no potential for active price increases in the future. Japanese merchants are inclined to sell off raw yarn, and although some manufacturers are buying, the market continues to decline under such circumstances. Prices for all months have fallen by two to one and seven or eight mace (a unit of currency) compared to last week. The total transaction volume for the week was 120,700 bales, with spot yarn purchases by various groups amounting to 6,440 bales. The market price for Japanese 10-count "Blue Phoenix" yarn fell by two to three taels. If spot yarn sales do not improve, a major price drop may be in the offing, as its price is higher than futures contracts, and factories are offering very little.</p>
<h3 id="e193">A Glimpse of the Cotton Market During the Past Week <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Standard Cotton Lacks Vitality... Prices for All Months Fall Again by Seven or Eight Mace</p>
<p>The Stillness of Spot Sales... Rare in Recent Years</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the cotton market trend had somewhat stabilized due to talk of a bailout for American cotton. Japanese merchants sold short, but after the meeting yielded no results, American cotton fell again, increasing anxieties. The Japanese firm, Toyo Cotton, resumed large-scale sell-offs, creating a sharp downward trend in the market. Actual spot cotton trading has been virtually eliminated, completely overtaken by Indian and American cotton. Furthermore, foreign firms are actively seeking solutions, willing to make special price concessions. With the retreat of bandits and the return of troops in Shashi, Hubei, transportation has become safer, and the influx of new cotton into Wuhan is gradually increasing, causing prices to fall by two yuan. Some in the Shashi group are hedging sales, while some retail investors, seeing the deteriorating situation, are cutting their losses. Consequently, prices for all months have fallen below the 31-tael mark. It is observed that many inland groups and the Tongzhou group, considering the poor local harvests, have brought in a significant volume of bales that have yet to be released, suggesting further significant changes in the future. According to veteran cotton merchants, the current cotton business is the quietest it has been in years, mainly because Chinese cotton is two to three taels more expensive. Therefore, both Chinese and foreign factories are purchasing Indian cotton for delivery in January, February, and March of next year, totaling approximately 200,000 to 300,000 pieces (each piece weighing 500 pounds). The future of the cotton market is not optimistic. Standard cotton prices for all months have fallen by seven or eight mace compared to last week. Total transaction volume for the week was 357,400 dan (a unit of weight). The sources at the dock were 10,000 bales of Yao cotton and 550 bales of Tong cotton. Factories purchased 72,824 dan of spot and futures cotton, and trading firms purchased 7,405 dan. The volume of purchases by various manufacturers and firms is listed below:</p>

<p>A New York dispatch from the 17th reports on the cotton market during the past week, stating that it was uneven and unpredictable. However, the underlying sentiment remained stable, as traders and speculators were buying the December futures contract below 15 cents. The maintenance plan discussed by the related groups at the New Orleans meeting on Monday has reportedly decided to advise yarn factories to immediately cover their long-term needs and advise banks to provide loans to secure their current cotton harvest and subsidize future production, with plans to reduce cotton planting next spring. It is also reported that the cooperative association will hold onto its 1.3 million bales in anticipation of a good price. These developments are somewhat encouraging, but have failed to stimulate recent demand. Yesterday's first frost had little impact on the market. The attached weekly statistics are listed below:</p>

<p>Bombay: Last week, traders were cautious due to rising prices and increased supply. However, short selling is inevitable in the coming weeks, so the current situation is unlikely to rise. Regarding the Central Cotton Committee of India's request for the government to purchase cotton to prevent farmers from selling, the government has not agreed, but has promised to discuss assisting cotton farmers with the Imperial Bank of India. Spot demand is average, and Indian yarn factories have purchased a considerable amount of new cotton. The weather and harvest reports in the cotton-growing areas are all favorable. The attached weekly statistics are as follows (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1929 1930</p>
<p>Total Receipts since September 1st 97 96</p>
<p>Weekend Inventory 668 457</p>

<p>Liverpool: Last week, spot demand was moderate. Futures were slightly volatile due to the New Orleans meeting early in the week. Overall, trading was average, but trade with the mainland and India was quite considerable. Egyptian cotton business was stable. It is reported that the government's opinion is to only expand the planting of cotton that is most needed.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Grains: The Rice Market in Hexia Plummets <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, over fifty boats arrived from various groups on Luli Road, and market sales continued to worsen. Total rice inventory on the river reached as many as two hundred boats. New japonica rice fell by 40 cents, with premium grades opening particularly low at 15 yuan, and general grades also fell to 60-70 cents. Inferior grades were only offered at 12.8 yuan. Hanzhou rice was scarce and held steady. The market situation for xiang rice was uniquely stable due to sudden transactions from out-of-town buyers, combined with the reluctance of sellers to sell, thus enabling the market price to stand firm, opening high at 11.2 yuan for premium Dujian, with sources seeing immediate acceptance, and very active selling, with a small price decrease of about 40 cents. The overall price was 11.6 yuan. Port tip rice fell by 50 cents, only opening at 10.08 yuan. The market situation was unusually soft. Although inventory of Bianyuan rice was not high, there was an appearance of no buyers for available goods due to the lack of principals. The price of Yinyuan rice opened slightly higher, with high-grade goods at 13.3-13.4 yuan.</p>
<p>Hunan, Shanghai: Yesterday, about 30 boats arrived at the river. Sales in this district have collapsed. Changbang new japonica rice has fallen to 14.6 yuan. Sutong baijing rice is already on the left side of the 13 yuan level, with the price falling sharply. The inventory of bottom-grade rice in this district is increasing daily, with sluggish sales, hence the collapse. Southern rice varieties, such as thin-grained rice and white rice, were scarce, with frequent imports from Ningbo, and prices remained flat, opening at 13.5 yuan. Sheep Dujian rice was short by 20 cents, with prices ranging from 11 yuan to 9.5 yuan, with very little trading. The price of Bianyuan rice remained flat, and the price of Linghua rice fell slightly by 10 cents. The overall market situation showed a downward trend.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Flour Market Suddenly Tightens <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the prices for all months suddenly showed signs of tightening. This was because the market had fallen sharply step by step during the previous week, which seemed excessive. The amount of imported wheat was limited, and the current atmosphere was entirely due to fixed orders, resulting in this panic. As for the factories' spot goods, they consistently held at the 2.3 mace level because the cost was high and there was no room for price cuts. Yesterday, due to factory purchases and slight activity from out-of-town buyers, the market recovered. A large number of floating long positions in the distant months have all been sold out, and the current buyers are all new players. With the market renewed, the sentiment also followed suit. As a result, the current month rose by 2.75 cents compared to the previous week, November to February rose by 2.5 cents, and March rose by 2.75 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Wheat Futures Rebound Strongly <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, the prices for all months remained flat because there was no change in the price of imported wheat. However, after the second session, the market secretly tightened because the current month must be delivered soon, and the inventory at the exchange was reported to be around 500 tons. The long side generally had preparations for receiving the goods, while the short side had no definite indication due to the commodity situation. Therefore, the sentiment suddenly rose, and the rebound was unusually strong. The sharp decline inevitably triggered the emergence of new long positions, and this cycle may be considerable in the future. November also jumped sharply due to the spot situation. As a result, the current month rose by 6 cents compared to the previous week, November rose by 1 qian, December rose by 5 cents, January and February rose by 6 cents, and March rose by 7 cents. The spot wheat market was improving, and the sentiment was also good. Special high-grade goods opened at 4.6 taels, while medium and lower-grade goods remained below the 4-tael mark. A total of 1,200 bags of high-grade Gaoyou, Bengbu, and Shandong wheat were purchased by Fufeng and Xinda.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Soybean Prices Rise Sharply <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the standard soybean market was excellent, with strong buying interest from all parties, especially from factories. Short covering was also very active, so after receiving the report of rising prices from Dalian in the afternoon, the sentiment became more intense, and the price rose steadily. At closing, the December contract rose by 8 cents compared to last Saturday, and the January, February, and March contracts were all better by half. Spot soybeans opened flat in the morning, but the situation was lively in the afternoon, with Dalian Yuan soybeans quoted at 4.9 taels and Jiujiang late soybeans quoted at 4.978 taels, totaling 2,000 bags, which were purchased by Xiaomo and other groups.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Sugar Market: Refined Granulated Sugar Market Quiet and Weak <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market lacked news from the production areas, and trading in the association's market remained sparse. There was limited buying interest in Dutch 24 coarse granulated sugar, with a bid price of 7.85 taels, and limited supply. The market for fine granulated white sugar was also flat at 7.9 taels. Dutch No. 8 raw sugar was relatively stable at 6.3 taels. Japanese sugar: N mark at 7.8 taels, YT mark at 7.7 taels, TK mark at 7.75 taels, with limited transactions. J mark at 8.15 taels, and the market was quite good. The number plate had domestic Mianhu raw sugar quoted at 30-40 bags, priced at 8.4 yuan, and Huanggangqing was also continuously offered for sale, with the price remaining unchanged at 6.3 yuan, with a flat and weak market. Huaxin offered 10 bags of Dutch raw sugar for sale at a price of 6.6 yuan, but the trading party did not complete the transaction due to the high price.</p>
<h3 id="e201">North-South Goods: Orchid Seeds, Ground Prices Rise <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The previous batch of orchid seeds had a relatively large arrival, and the number plate opened down by about 2 points. According to a letter from Xiamen, this year's true flood crop only harvested a total of 500 dan. After various groups purchased, only about half remained there, and it was already in the hands of dealers, so the purchase price suddenly tightened, rising nearly 2 yuan compared to before. Yesterday, Shenhao Jia shipped over 20 pieces from Xiamen, but due to cost issues, they were unable to unload and were trying to maintain the price.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Silk and Tea: Shanghai Factories Bullish <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market of foreign firms in this port gradually saw a turnaround. Since the shutdown of silk factories, European firms, seeing the daily decrease in silk production, began to purchase and throw. Yesterday, various foreign firms separately invited various manufacturers to negotiate, and trading in white factory silk was conducted. The goods owners hoped for higher prices before selling, and the negotiations were not yet completed, so the transaction was pending. Silk prices were bullish. Yesterday, Dachang and others purchased 15 bales of Sichuan yellow factory silk, and the price remained firm.</p>
<h3 id="e203">No Major Progress in the Tea Market <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was no major progress in the tea market of foreign firms in this port. British and French traders only conducted a small number of transactions for fine eyebrow pearl tea, and the market situation remained unchanged from before. Although the Russian Assistance Association continued to search for tribute Xizhen eyebrow green tea and Qimen black tea, their offered prices were extremely low. Yihe Foreign Firm slightly increased its purchasing of Fenghuang eyebrow and shrimp eye from dismantled lots, but the selling price remained low.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Miscellaneous: Pepper Market's Rising Momentum Weak <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Production Area Pricey... High Demand... Low Inventory</p>
<p>(Pepper) Yesterday, a dispatch from Holland reported that the production market saw its price rise sharply by 6.75 guilders due to major hoarding purchases. Furthermore, seed farmers were unwilling to sell urgently, so there may be continued price increases in the future. The local trading firms, upon receiving this dispatch, tightened their holdings and tried to sell at higher prices. Moreover, the Huguang and Fujian groups' daily demand was quite strong. It is estimated that the number of transactions within this week was about 400 bags, so the inventory on the street gradually thinned. Sales in the northern provinces are also about to start. If there is no source of supply, there is a risk of demand exceeding supply, so the trading plate called for a rise in the price of black large original pepper to 52 taels per thousand, and No. 1 pepper to 51 taels, a rise of over 5 taels compared to the previous plate. (Silver Pepper) The market also tightened, with current sales of high-end goods at 78 taels, and ordinary goods at 73-74 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Piece Goods: The Summit of Fine Serge <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>This factory's cotton cloth: Yesterday, coarse cloth rose sharply, suddenly increasing by 10-20 cents. Hubei Tianzi has risen to 8.75 taels. 16-pound peony opened at 7.35 taels, and 5-crane at 7.3 taels. 13-pound double horse and dog both had no spot goods. 11-pound cloth had additions from Tianjin, Niuzhuang, and other groups yesterday. 3-rabbit and 3-deer at 4.85 taels, and Renzhong at 4.75 taels, also rose compared to before. Fine twill remained firm, and Yanghe continued to sell at 7.325 taels, and blue double fish at 7 taels. Fine cloth sales were sluggish and increasingly weak. The price of trumpet brand blue double fish and colored ball opened at 6.85 taels yesterday, blue chicken at 6.675 taels, and white cloth remained depressed due to abundant arrivals.</p>
<p>East-West Piece Goods: Eastern goods alone rose yesterday. Fine serge had a strong upward trend, opening at unprecedentedly high prices. Huxinting's shiny shiny yuan called for 31.5 cents, and miscellaneous colors sold at 31 cents. Sanyou Tu's banana leaf inscription and Zijinshan all came out of the pass at 30 cents. During the spring season, it only sold for over 23 cents. Now, the price has risen by over 7 cents per yard, reaching 100 taels per box, which is rare. Straight line is also very popular and sells because it is out of stock. Yesterday, double-tone abdomen sold for 30.05 cents, and Mo Qianshan for 32.5 cents. The existing stock of Yipin Changbanqiao Layanshi Ledao is uniformly lacking, so the domestic Four Happiness brand also had considerable activity yesterday, selling for 28.5 cents. Western goods remained quiet. Only yuan diagonal Ning silk sold more than 20 pieces, with prices generally around 33 cents.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the Hu Nan Rice Market, various gangs had 30 to 40 boats arriving. Transactions on this street were extremely light, and the market prices were gradually declining. Thick rice fell by 4 to 5 jiao, while other goods fell by 1 to 2 jiao. Only kiln seeds remained stable.</p>

It comes from birds of prey that live in the mountains and forests of Mongolia and Manchuria. Those named "eagle" are produced in the north, and those named "sea blue" are produced in the North Sea, which is the "tiger eagle" mentioned in the herbal medicine book "Compendium of Materia Medica."

<p>The World Grand Theater at the corner of Qingyun Road, Zhabei, announces that it will screen martial arts, mechanical, and unofficial history films day and night from the day before yesterday (19th). "Five Episodes of Qianlong's Travels in Jiangnan" is the latest production of the Tianyi Film Company and is the masterpiece of the beautiful movie star Ms. Chen Yumei. The plot is full of twists and turns, and the performance is profound and realistic, making it even more exciting than the previous episodes. It can be regarded as an outstanding domestic film.</p>
<p>Youlian Film Company announces that the widely acclaimed "Wild River Heroine" film was shown at the Central Grand Theater on the previous days and the crowds were massive. Today, starting in the future, the production will continue showing at the Empire Theater. Also, the heroic film "Children of the Heroes," which first set the martial arts banner of the domestic film industry, has been approved to open as a mega-film at the Central Theater on the 14th of next month. The male protagonist of "Yu Meiren" has been set as Zhu Fei. Mr. Zhu is one of the most popular young actors in the film industry. This play will be even more brilliant with him as the male lead.</p>
<p>The Central Grand Theater announces that since the release of episodes one and two of "Burning Pingchang City," people from all walks of life have exclaimed it as a masterpiece. Its photography and plot are enough to represent "Red Lotus Temple," and it has the same wonderful effect as "Red Lotus Temple." Unfortunately, it was shown in the hot summer, and although the audience was extremely crowded, many people did not see this film. In view of this, and taking advantage of the upcoming premiere of the new third episode, this theater will repeat the joint screening of the first and second episodes once, so that it can be continuously screened. The price remains the same, and the time is changed to two screenings at 3:00 PM and 9:00 PM. Please pay attention.</p>
<p>The Golden Grand Theater announces that the function of drama is to give people an impression and arouse inner resonance. In many phenomena of life, people are often obsessed and cannot be aware. However, once a drama clearly points out these phenomena in an organized way, they can recognize many superficial but unnoticed impressions. The film "Wise Father, Filial Son" has gained immortal reputation worldwide because it can give people very profound impressions. This grand theater will premiere this film today, and each screening will also feature the Monte Carlo song and dance.</p>
<p>The Paris Theater on Xiafei Road, opposite the Kair's Dance School, is the earliest established dance school in Shanghai. Many famous social dancers in Shanghai have come from this school.

<p>— Guangmei</p>
<p>"Brother, today is my seventh Mid-Autumn Festival away from home. Seven years ago today, I was still an innocent child, not fully understanding anything. No matter how busy Mother was with her affairs, or how urgently she was collecting debts, I couldn't and didn't know how to share the burden for her. I still happily played with you, piling up pastries, arranging toys, buying lanterns, decorating the Guanghan Palace to celebrate the Moon Goddess, and indulging in the golden rule of 'no moon indoors, rain and snow outdoors.' So, we competed to wash our hands and faces, devoutly worshiped the moon, and the firecrackers and incense filled the air. Do you remember this scene? It was this very night, wasn't it? You were all asleep, and Mother, exhausted from the day's work, had also gone to bed early. Only my older sister and I were still awake. So, without Mother's permission, we rashly went with our uncle and others to stroll around the city walls, going up from the South Gate and down to the North Gate. By the time we got home, the moon had already set, and our shoes and socks were soaked with dew. Coincidentally, Mother woke up and asked us where we had been. Not knowing the consequences, I proudly told Mother, only to find her extremely angry. She gave us a severe scolding, 'Girls in their teens have no reason to go out to play in the middle of the night. If we run into acquaintances, wouldn't they scold me for raising my children without any discipline?' My older sister secretly blamed me for being too straightforward and not leaving anything out. In fact, Heaven, how could I have known that she would be so furious, let alone that it was wrong to go? At the time, I hated Mother, 'Why can't girls go out to play in the middle of the night?' From joy came sorrow, and I could only resort to crying. My older sister did the same. Ah, brother, that was seven years ago. Now, now... It's unbearable to look back on the past, and the future is unpredictable.</p>
<p>Although I rationally know that I shouldn't care about the Mid-Autumn Festival, at this moment, reason can't overcome emotion. This subconscious, deeply rooted nature is a mystery even to myself. It's still morning now, and I'm already thinking like this. Today, today, how will I spend this moonlit night?"</p>
<p>Indeed, it was too much. I lost my reason and impulsively wrote the above passage and mailed it to my brother. I wonder what he'll think, whether he'll laugh at me for being old-fashioned or whether he's thinking of our parents too.</p>
<p>Of the sisters in the room, only Ye and I are left. The exceptionally bright moon shines through the window screen, directly illuminating the front half of the room. Because we love her so much, we temporarily turned off the lights. Ye and I stood facing the window, sighing frequently as if by agreement, "I'm so sad, so sad."</p>
<p>"I want to cry, Ye, but I hate that my tears are as precious as gold, not following my wishes."</p>
<p>"I want to cry too, crying seems to be pleasant, but I can't do it, so I won't cry."</p>
<p>We were silent for a while, and the whole room was filled with the feeling of travelers missing their families. The sacred moonlight enveloped this bitter feeling, making it seem even more desolate. A cricket, having lost its youth and vitality, was clearly making a final struggle, stammering intermittently, as if to help the travelers express their unbearable grief. We were even more saddened.</p>
<p>"Ah, beautiful moon, how bright you are. Tonight, tonight is my seventh Mid-Autumn Festival away from home. Kind Mother, adorable younger siblings, do they, do they still remember me at this moment? Recalling the scene of strolling around the city walls seven years ago, at that time, the ignorant me hated Mother. Now..."</p>
<p>When Xiu in the opposite room heard my voice, she hurriedly ran over excitedly, "Haha, Guangmei is making a new drama again." Her words interrupted my thoughts. At the same time, I realized that life is actually not that different from acting in a play. Precious tears fell without restraint and weren’t valuable in the slightest.</p>
<p>"Ah, Guangmei, you're crying. If you cry, I'll cry too," Ye was the first to notice.</p>
<p>"You're lucky you can cry, like little kids. I'm not sad at all. If I miss home, I'll miss my friends," Xiu said without sympathizing with us, making us even sadder.</p>
<p>"If you miss friends, it doesn't necessarily have to be tonight. There's only the saying 'people miss their loved ones all the more during festivals,' there's no reason to miss friends all the more," Ye argued with her while still laughing. I didn't want to say anything, and collapsed on the bed, sobbing to myself.</p>
<p>"Get up, Guangmei, don't cry. Crying is a sign of weakness, it's shameful. Useless youths, let's try to enjoy the moon. Don't waste this good night," Ye said, clearly using reason to restrain her emotions.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, besides working hard, what else can we say? Let's go have fun. Don't waste this good night."</p>
<p>As a result of our discussion, we decided to go to Paotaiwan. But that would be too monotonous. To be honest, we were a little scared. We planned to call Mao in Wusong to go with us.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" Shen and Zhuang asked us as they met us.</p>
<p>"Nowhere in particular, and you?" Ye and I replied in unison.</p>
<p>"Is Wusong good to go?"</p>
<p>"Extremely good. That's what we were thinking too."</p>
<p>"Okay, let's go together."</p>
<p>Shen and Zhuang had to wait for half an hour at the Wusong station while Ye and I asked Mao to come over. At the time, I could only apologize profusely to Shen and Zhuang. Words were simply not enough to express the apology I felt.</p>
<p>Paotaiwan was nothing like it usually was. The narrow roads were packed with people, and it was hard to get through. Clearly, people were still reluctant to let go of the lunar Mid-Autumn Festival. Along the way, residents had set out many seasonal foods and fruits to celebrate the Moon Goddess. The sounds of stringed instruments and firecrackers were all mixed together. It was clear that the lunar calendar was difficult to abolish quickly.</p>
<p>"Guangmei, Meiguang," A lively expression filled a clear voice. Clearly, it was a woman's voice. I was pleasantly surprised. "Who's calling me?" Although the voice was very familiar to me, I couldn't guess who it was right away. Taking a closer look,</p>
<p>"Ah, Tang, is that you? I didn't even notice. How many of you came?" I excitedly shook her hand.</p>
<p>"Guangmei," Again a voice very familiar to me. Tang hurriedly told me "It's Mr. Li." I was extremely happy to also meet Mr. Li Tianxing, a teacher I respect. Then, Comrade Deng greeted me. They were gathered on the Qing dike, a large rock that jutted out between the Huangpu River and the Yangtze River, eating things, probably with alcohol as well, enjoying their elegant moon viewing event.</p>
<p>We moved forward along the rugged stone road. Gradually, there were no pedestrians ahead and no one coming behind. But we were still very far from the lighthouse. So, we stopped and took a break. This abandoned dike has the Huangpu River on its left and the Yangtze River on its right, with the lighthouse in front. The Huangpu River surged fiercely, while the Yangtze River was quiet and serene. The universe is just such a symbol. The Huangpu is like a brave and well-mannered knight, while the Yangtze is like a gentle and sweet beauty. The strong knight smashed the round moon into pieces, and we saw streaks of golden light, dazzling. Far, far away, farther, straight out to where the water and sky could not be distinguished, it seemed as if the golden earth covered the surface of the river. Mr. Shen, however, would tease Mr. Zhuang from time to time, "Zhuang, look, how many moons are in the water?" We also threw stones into the water. The stones over there weighed at least a few pounds. Ye and I, however, put in all our might, which is a shame to say, but they still supplied us the rocks. We couldn't reach to get the stones ourselves. Their strength was greater, so the stones they threw were bigger, and the sound was louder. The meaning of life is just this. It's like a thrown stone being able to make ripples on the surface of the water, which has some influence on mankind. What's more, the stones we threw down make a loud sound.</p>
<p>It was already 9:30. We started to turn back. By the time we walked back to the dike, the tourists had dispersed almost entirely. Tang and Mr. Li and the others had left before us at some point. We talked and walked until we reached the station, and it was already 10:30. I was only worried about whether Mao would be able to get back to school on time. Before long, Wusong Town was here, and Mao said goodbye to us.</p>
<p>After getting off at Tiantong'an, in order to not waste the good moonlight, we simply walked to school. The firm moonlight filled the earth. There wasn't a single pedestrian on the smooth, dance-hall-like Jiangwan Road. Only the reflections from the asphalt ground, shining brightly, illuminated us. I didn't know if they were welcoming us or seeing us off. I said happily to Guang, "Jiangwan Road is ours, look, there isn't a single pedestrian. You precious poet, this is exactly the time for you to write a poem. The earth has already presented you with a firm poetic intention."</p>
<p>When we arrived at the school, the clock tower told us it was a quarter to twelve. We were too careless. But it was truly a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Daxia Wanbai Literary Society <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Recently, literary groups in various universities have been growing and flourishing like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Especially the newly emerging Daxia in Huxi, this semester has more than 1,700 students and has natural beauty. So, from the beginning of school until now, only a month, various social organizations have already sprung up, and the well-performing Wanbai Literary Society, in order to promote fellowship among its members and advance the society's affairs, held a general meeting of all members at the school's church No. 212 on the 14th of this month. The society's membership has almost doubled compared to last semester, totaling about a hundred people. Yesterday's general meeting, except for those who were absent due to affairs, about eighty people attended, gathered together, and it was a grand occasion. When the bell rang seven times, the meeting was officially announced. Then, Mr. Xu Zexiang was publicly elected as the chairman of the meeting, and Mr. Zhang Zhenyong was the record keeper. First, Mr. Xu Zexiang gave the opening remarks, and the intention was new and outstanding. The entire hall's atmosphere became even more tense. Then, the previous executive committee members gave reports on their work. The whole body was also quite satisfied with the report. Then, the guidelines for the society's operations and the amendments to the charter were discussed in succession. Then, new and old members were introduced. Then, elections were held again. The results of the election were Xu Zexiang, Ms. Hu Kewen, Zhang Zhenyong, Xie Shufu, Wang Ruinian, Tong Shiquan, Geng Kangfu, and ten other members. After the election, the amusements began, and the atmosphere was raised. For example, Mr. Cheng Chunlin's English song, Pan Quan, Mei Guangdao, and others' Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera, all received a lot of applause. After a heated congress, it adjourned at ten thirty o'clock. (Also, Qiu)</p>

<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>"Nationalistic literature has a very deep and solid foundation in the world's documents, from Greece to the present. This history is described in great detail in the "Declaration of the Nationalist Literary Movement." You can read it carefully yourself. In short, the facts must be based on evidence. The nationalist literary movement is not without basis. Moreover, it is us! Not just us—we should come out and do this kind of movement. There is also a very powerful fact proving the urgent need for the nationalist literary movement. According to the latest surveys of unemployed populations in various countries around the world, the United States has 5 million unemployed, the United Kingdom has 3 million, Japan has 1 million, and China? It is impossible to count. Even worse than unemployment, there are about 80 million people who cannot even find bark and grass roots to eat. The unemployed workers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan are only 5 million, 3 million, or 1 million, but it has already caused a great uproar, and the government is racking its brains to find relief methods. But what about China? I am afraid that unemployment will only wait for the time when there is no food to eat, and those who have to eat bark and grass roots will probably have no hope other than waiting for death. In such suffering, what other way is there but to carry out thorough relief based on nationalism to achieve the goal of self-determination? Therefore, the nationalist movement, using facts to prove it, is the urgent task at hand."</p>
<p>Rong's words were like this. Therefore, his efforts in the nationalist literary movement were what he should do. However, continuing to work tirelessly like this would inevitably harm his weak body. From my standpoint and in the circle of love, I cannot abandon my sincerity in caring for him and gently persuade him to rest on time at fixed rest hours every night. Therefore, I helped him while also advising him to rest on time.</p>
<p>This was truly beyond my expectations. Before 5 o'clock this afternoon, Brother Rong leisurely returned home from the office. At this time, the maid had not yet washed the rice to prepare for cooking. I was afraid that he had already been tired all day and was about to start writing again, so I begged him to go to a restaurant—begged him to go to Sinya to eat Nanyang Curry Chicken. Getting his consent, we went to Sinya.</p>
<p>Sinya, this Cantonese restaurant, was originally where we often ate before we got married. Rong also often went there with his friends to drink tea and eat dim sum. Moreover, at one time, many of Rong's literary works were produced there. According to him, Sinya has a special charm for him, and he has an excellent impression of Sinya. Everything there makes him feel very satisfied. As for why I like it, of course, it is because it is truly both new and elegant, and I also love to eat its Nanyang Curry Chicken the most, because this dish is particularly delicious at Sinya. Other restaurants can't compare, not to mention what you can cook at home. We arrived at Sinya at five minutes before half-past five. Rong was not happy to go to the third floor, so we chose a seat in the west hall on the second floor. Everything was familiar to us, and this time, unintentionally, we paid no attention to it at all. However, at the west end of two square tables put together to form a long table on the south side, a diner sitting there especially caught my attention. Of course, there was more than just him sitting on both sides of the table; there were several others. But he really made me pay too much attention. He was laughably fat, a stout, large lump like a German sausage, with a purplish-red face, filled with vulgarity. He held onto the corners of the table with both hands, one of which also raised his thumb, tearing open his lips, revealing his teeth, and chatting with his tablemates. He was speaking Cantonese, but it was Cantonese that we Cantonese people couldn't understand. His strange appearance made me guess that he was a henchman of some Cantonese gang, or the boss of a North-South grocery store. But Rong said that he was the Cantonese who was famous for writing triangular love novels. I couldn't help but laugh and say, "No wonder his fat face doesn't have a bit of elegance." Rong laughed when he heard this, and a bowl of Nanyang Curry Chicken, which we love to eat, had already been brought to the table by a waiter in white clothes.</p>

<h3 id="e230">"Youth Lamp" Inaugural Issue <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Wei</p>
<p>Edited by the Youth Lamp Society</p>
<p>Distributed by Daguang Bookstore</p>
<p>"Youth is the core of the times, the source of society, and the vitality of the nation. Everyone says this, but what exactly is the manifestation of the facts? Look, youth cannot awaken themselves to take on major responsibilities and missions, and various publications that point out the way for generally blind and clueless youth also lack a central consciousness and are equally pathetic. Therefore, youth in this situation naturally form a more and more chaotic phenomenon, further and further away from people's earnest expectations.</p>
<p>Since we youth are imbued with the vitality of the nation, then we should strive for our nation. Our nation is currently in an era of suffering, and the responsibility lies on the shoulders of us youth. How will youth extricate the nation from the whirlpool of suffering? Not long ago, we were very happy to discover a "Youth of the Times." This publication can be said to have risen suddenly in the youth world. Its consciousness is centered on the national movement, and it has been widely welcomed by the youth world since its publication. This also proves that youth themselves are increasingly entering a realm of awakening. However, this has unknowingly triggered a lively phenomenon in youth publications. Recently, we have also discovered this "Youth Lamp."</p>
<p>In the "Inaugural Statement," we can recognize that "Youth Lamp's" attitude is like this:</p>
<p>We know that the power to drive the times mostly relies on the efforts of the youth of the times. To put it more sharply and incisively, it can also be said that it completely relies on nurturing youth. I believe this statement may not be an overstatement in any way. Isn't the fact laid out before our eyes like this? Therefore, in recent times, the depression of youth's will and the recklessness of their actions have been followed by the depression of the will and the recklessness of the actions of the majority of the people. The entire nation has also become depressed and gone downhill, creating the current era of great terror on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>For this reason, they dare not remain silent any longer. They want to sincerely do their best for youth, and so "Youth Lamp" was born in this way.</p>
<p>We know that our Chinese nation has many defects, and we should naturally actively think of ways to cure them, infuse the consciousness of the nation, and ignite the torch of the nation. To implement this plan, to trace the origin and explore the root, we should start by curing the sick bear of youth to save the core of the times. The colleagues know that knowledge and ability are both shallow, but seeing the imminent crisis, based on our inner selves, we always feel that we should do our best, exhaust our knowledge, erect the bright lamp of youth, point the way to the general youth wandering at the crossroads, and lead them to the wide road we yearn for.</p>
<p>What a huge responsibility this is! At the same time, the diseases of youth are so complex. Our small and weak cry cannot arouse the excitement of the times or awaken all the deluded youth. This is naturally expected. However, driven by our inner selves, we feel that we must light this street lamp. Therefore, "Youth Lamp" was born in this way.</p>
<p>But—the inaugural statement says this. Before seeing the content, we naturally cannot rashly believe it. So, let's examine the content before speaking.</p>
<p>Yang Shaozhi's "Respectfully Dedicated to Those in Charge of Student Organizations" is a text that prescribes the right medicine. The author first criticizes the actions of past student organization leaders, and then puts forward his three requirements. First, the officials of student-run associations should truly become public servants of all students to fulfill the expectations of those who entrust them. Second, in terms of thought, they should establish a correct consciousness and point out a correct path for students. They should do their best for the nation. Third, in terms of action, they should recognize the correct path and find a way out from the bright side. Alas, those in charge of student organizations in various schools, please ponder these three points more!</p>
<p>Tao Yuchuan's "Youth and Literature" explains the close relationship between youth and literature very clearly. At the end, the author points out that our literature should advance towards the road of national freedom.</p>
<p>The case of Locke "Not Afraid of Death" fills us with sorrow. Such a great shame to the nation, anyone with a slight sense of nationalism, will stand up to oppose it. But this kind of opposition is still passive. We must start from the positive aspects and engage in our own films. This is the good result of this stimulation. Xu Xiyu's "From the 'Not Afraid of Death' Incident to Nationalist Cinema" emphasizes this aspect and urges youth to deeply reflect. We know that film is developed by the combination of industry, science, and art. Film is the eighth art in the category of emerging arts. In modern times, we not only see the historical facts of national literature in literature and art, but the progress of world national literature is even more obvious. However, the evolution of nationalism in film is even stronger, especially in the aspect of national identity, it is expressed more clearly. Recently, the imperial</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>ism toward weak nations, but using films, borrowing the expression of films to show the greatness of their own nation and the inferiority of other nations. Now "Not Afraid of Death" is exactly like this. Therefore, the author believes that Chinese films in the future should strive for the nationalist film movement.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also Shen Shuowen's "The Self-Awareness That Chinese Youth Students Should Have" and Tang Zeng's and Xu Zexiang's poems, etc. Xilun's "Scraps of School Life" is like chewing gum. Shaozhi's novel "The Death of a Warrior" depicts a scene of a warrior plotting an Indian national revolution. It is an unfinished manuscript, so there is nothing to say about it.</p>
<p>In general, this "Youth Lamp" has not yet made any major breakthroughs. If it continues to work hard to improve, it is not difficult to become a central publication in the youth world, standing in the same position as "Youth of the Times," encouraging and stimulating the national consciousness of youth, and urging youth to fulfill their due mission.</p>

<p>— Gao Wei</p>
<p>What I want to introduce here is the crystallizing "Wuben" inaugural issue collected by Wuben students. But I must declare in advance that the title above borrows the words of You Xiang's "Last Page." You Xiang's intention is humility, afraid that people will praise him like this, so he says he can't afford it first, but I can't help but disagree. This, I should first ask You Xiang to forgive.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, women's works always have a special flavor. It's not arbitrary, especially works like this, which are really a great opportunity to study women's psychology. In the works, it seems as if the whole heart is exposed. Their hot blood, their emotions, everything in their hearts is nakedly expressed. Because there is no other concept existing in their hearts, they only have the memories of inherent scars, or the eulogy of youth, or expectations for their own future. Even if they express some dissatisfaction with the social reality environment, they only rely on ordinary concepts and there will be no violent conflicts. This is how life makes them (if you don't believe it, you can refer to the nearby "Wuben"). Therefore, the value of this kind of work that is worth our savoring is to make us recognize what kind of outline is forming in the hearts of a general new era of female students. Although it cannot be said that these are all harmonies of their hearts, there are more or less connotations of their subjective views. "We want to cry, we cry; we want to laugh, we laugh. Here, there are our tears, our laughter, our dreams, songs, our pity, anger, and sympathy." Isn't it more proving to read the words of "Wuben's" "First Page"?</p>
<p>On the other hand, because women are more sentimental by tradition, they may be more neurotic than men. The sad part of them, just talking about "tears," when we read Qi Ying's "Talking about Crying," it says that crying is a woman's special responsibility, which is more like speaking for herself.</p>
<p>In this lesson, I want to talk about the literary and artistic aspects specifically. Henglu's three-act play "Flattery, Snobbery" is cursing the flattery and snobbery of men, using bank clerks to vent their anger. There are indeed not a few stories about describing love stories. It's really worth seeing love. Cursing rituals and teachings, there are Nuzhen's "Peace," Qingqin's "Mad Woman," Yun's "Rebellious Prisoner," Er's "Dusk," Luo Meiyun's "Miss C," Ruolian's "A Letter," etc. We can recognize the women struggling under rituals and teachings. Alas, rituals and teachings are really the great enemies of youth! Ali's "Past" describes teacher-student love, and the teacher's hungry appearance is made to look like he wants to cry but can't laugh. Nuzhen's "Times Smaller Than Now" describes the situation of being drunk in love, and the psychology is indeed more clearly described than by men. In addition, there are several tragedies describing love. Yiyun's "Clear Breeze in the Bedroom" makes us laugh so much that we can't stop. I really thank this lady for revealing a fragment of life. This is Chun's conversation written before going to bed. We can know what kind of impression the general women's views on love leave in their hearts. Pin San's "Ornament" completely exposes the hypocrisy of men, implying that the general young men do not hesitate to please women and make themselves beautiful. They use other people's help to make money, but when it comes to women's social events, they put on enough airs, suits, cosmetics.</p>
<p>Others, in the fillers, there are also many that are mean to men, and at the same time, they also express their true feelings. For example, Luo Ying's one, two, and three-page filler, "All the women in the world are disasters." If a man thinks that this is "correct," then he can ignore near women."</p>
<p>As for those who tell their inner sorrow, there are also many, such as Ping's "Tears" and "Sorrow of Life," simply sighing "Life is really sad, life is really sad." The lamp in Pin San's Na Dengxia is also a piece of suffering, the sorrow for the passing of youth, there are really too many tears. Secondly, there are not a few who feel the troubles of youth. Here are examples of fillers, because I think fillers are more real. Nuzhen said on page two hundred and eighteen, "Such a life is too lonely for me. How can you not cry to me? God, since you have given me youth, why do you give me loneliness?" Oh, the passion is extreme.</p>
<p>There are several articles here that are written very meaningfully, and the text is also very beautiful, such as Zhixiao's "White Clouds," Ping's "Blood," Yiyi's "Village," and You Xiang's "String Sound," but I don't want to introduce them one by one, I'm afraid it will take up too much space.</p>
<p>Therefore, in general, if this "Wuben" can be infused with correct central ideas, it is really not difficult to become an excellent member of the nation. However, I hope that the students of "Wuben" should avoid the attitude of "wanting to cry and crying, wanting to laugh and laughing" in the future. Of course, this shows the purity of your hearts, but you must know that literary and artistic works cannot simply rely on personal consciousness to be unrestrained once. In the current rapid current of the times, on the one hand, we cannot forget the requirements of women's own liberation, and on the other hand, we cannot forget the responsibility for the nation and the country. Alas, let's not care too much about our own desires. We must create a bright road for our nation. We cannot live alone in an "ivory tower."</p>
