<p>美前國務卿凱洛格。在領受和平奬金席上。演說列强實踐軍縮保證之時機已至。可以在文化大道上掃除軍縮競爭之惡魔。而德國著名科學家愛因斯坦博士。在美國演說。則謂美國如果實欲蘄求和平。則其能力。實足以打破貽害歐洲與全世界之黷武傳統策。使戰禍永不復發。是德博士之說。更欲以和平責任。督責於美國也。然其實和平責任。全在世界各國之合力同謀。而决非任何一國之力所能有成。試觀今日之歐洲形勢。所以成此相持不下之局者。亦絕非一二國之力。如軍縮籌委之爭議。兩方皆責對方無誠意於軍縮。而實則兩方皆不願實行軍縮。然亦非眞不欲實行軍縮也。各猜疑對方之不能實行。遂亦不敢自弛其軍備。又爲日趨嚴重之經濟大勢所驅迫。各欲於此潮流中競生存。圖自拔。而此猜疑之心因之愈甚。軍備亦愈不敢縮減。故平心而論。今日之各國。皆未嘗無意於和平。且亦未嘗不極順和平但又皆爲事實所阻。不能向和平途上進行。此所以一方面和平之說。愈唱愈高。而一方面戰爭之危機。愈趨愈近也。於此之時。苟再有一二好戰之國。生於其間。則此和平局面。勢將立破。故今日世界而苟猶有好戰之國。存急進之心。作徼倖萬一之想者。甚願其幡然而深思也。</p>

<p>納稅會决議對付辦法</p>
<p>房産公會今日開會議</p>
<p>公共租界自來水增價一案、自公司採用高壓手段、斷絕康腦脫路住户章天凱及蓬路華商别墅用水後、已引起社會嚴重之注意、納稅會方面亦積極進行交涉、茲將昨日所聞、分記如下、</p>
<p>納稅會昨日會議納稅華人會、於昨日中午十二時、召集常務委員會議、到有正副主席王曉籟徐寄廎·常務委員陸費伯鴻胡鳳翔·華董虞洽卿袁履登徐新六劉鴻生·華委員錢龍章吳藴齋·秘書嚴諤聲陶樂勤何海奎等、首由秘書報告各處斷水情形、次虞洽卿報告、經到會各人、詳細討論、僉以事關公共租界居民生命安全、應十分鄭重處理、所有議决各項對付辦法、經推由到會者分别負責担任、詳情暫不發表、至重要之點、爲（一）應請工部局採納市民公意、修改合同、（二）自來水公司必須恢復用水、並以後不得再有此種壓迫舉動、</p>
<p>房産會今日開會上海房産公會、得到自來水公司斷水報告後、即經負責人員爲一度之集議、决定、决不爲此種高壓手段所屈服、並定今日（十三）下午四時、召集緊急會議、討論對付、一面分電呼籲、茲分錄電函於下、（致英政府電）上海英總領事、北平英公使、倫敦英國内閣國會公鑒、昨日貴國商辦上海自來水公司勒迫居民加價、斷絕供水、以爲扼喉式之要挾、百萬居民生命、危在頃刻、羣情憤激、形勢嚴重、爲特請迅令恢復原狀、繼續供水、以重人道、而維中英睦誼、上海房産公會、十二月十二日、（呈政府當局）南京分呈外交部内政部上海市政府公鑒、英商上海自來水公司爲勒迫加價不遂、昨日實行斷絕供水、百萬居民生命、危在呼吸之間、迫切電陳、請賜交涉恢復水給、不勝待命之至、上海房産公會叩支、（通告各會員）逕啓者、茲因英商上海自來水公司加價不遂、不顧居民之生存權利、公用事業之特定原則、及刑法上之規定、實行於前日斷絕供水、百萬居民之生命財産安全、均被搖動、爲特定於十二月十三日（星期六）下午四時召集緊急會議、相應函請台端、届時到會、如派代表、請予全權爲荷、</p>
<p>工部局之態度本報記者昨以自來水加價問題、訪問工部局會辦瓊士、據答稱、工部局於十月間、因金貴銀賤關係、不得已經董事會議通過、准許自來水公司加價、當時華人方面有華董五人、爲其代表參加會議、工部局討論該案時、並爲顧及全市民利害着想、曾經十分精密詳細之研究、按自來水之取費有兩種標準一爲照水表計算、一爲照房租計算、目下上海自來水公司、則係照房租計算者、是種制度、有利於中下級社會居民、而不利於上級社會、因假設所用之水量相等、而納費則上級居民多、中下級居民少、譬如上中下三級居民、各以五口之家論、每人每月用水三十三加侖、全家共用一百六十五加侖、假定以房租百分之六取費、則房租十元者、月出水費六角、房租五十元者月出水費三元、房租一百兩者月須水費六兩、月租二百兩者水費須十二兩、用同量之水、一則納水費十二兩、一則納水費六角、上級社會居民所納水費、固超過水之成本、中下級社會居民所納水費、則又不及、工部局爲顧及多數人及自來水公司之利害、不得不取富人之有餘、以補貧民之不足、若以水表計算、則上中下三級市民所納水費、將屬平等、其結果則水費亦須平均增加百分之二十、是則中下級社會市民之負担、更爲加重、全市改裝水表、自來水公司方面、原甚樂爲、惟舉辦此事、須費二三百萬元、歷時亦須二三年、方克有濟也、更據自來水公司總工程師兼經理皮爾生宣稱、公司現擬召集股東大會、討論改用水表問題、此事工部局在原則上亦已贊同、蓋以此爲打開目前難關之唯一辦法、亦　節制市民用水之唯一方法也、至於公司已經斷絕供水者、不過二家、因其拖欠三個月之水費故也、至於照加價付費者、亦已有多家云云、此種說詞、未免偏於公司方面、惟爲研究本問題之眞相計、不得不蒐集各方面之主張而公平判斷之、故併存云、</p>

<p>前清同治十年之冬。南洋大臣兩江總督湘鄉曾文正公。札委上海徐雨之於四年中。每年挑選糼童三十人。派往美國肄習各科第一批選得曾篤恭。梁敦彦。鄧土聰。蔡錦章。張仁康。鍾俊成。石錦堂。錢文魁。何廷樑黄錫寳。詹天祐。潘銘鍾。曹吉福。劉家照。朱尙周。黄仲良。睦永泉。蔡紹基。黄開甲。史錦鏞。陳榮貴。程大器。歐陽賡。陳鉅溶。鍾文耀。吳仰曾。容尚謙羅國瑞。譚耀勳。鄺榮光三十人。於翌年七月首途其籍貫以廣東省爲最多。蓋佔二十四人。其餘六人則江蘇省佔三人。山東省佔一人。安徽省佔一人。福建省佔一人。其年歲以容尙謙鄺榮光二人爲最輕。蓋皆十歲。次則潘銘鍾·牛尙周·吳仰曾·譚耀勳四人。蓋皆十一歲。又次則詹天祐·劉家照·羅國瑞三人。蓋皆十二歲又次則何廷樑·黄錫寳·曹吉福·黄開甲·陳鉅溶五人。蓋皆十三歲。餘則十四五六歲。無有過十六歲者。其中曹吉福一人。則爲吾川沙人。其往美國。學習法律。回國之後。初任上海電報局職務後任上海英國按察使署文案。其時英按察爲皇家律師威金生。自得吉福先生爲文案。賓主相得。遂以文案終其身焉。吉福先生生子一。生女四。以其一生束脩所入。建爲五宅分給子女。蓋與吾鄉鄉先輩明季詩人杜季誠先生。一日而建七宅。以與六子。以一自居者。先後媲美焉。吉福先生一女。即歸於上海顔惠慶博士。至其一子。則自糼赴美。學習海軍。畢業之後。美國國務卿某。以其年少英俊。至欲妻以一女。其於本鄉固已聘室。至是退婚。遂娶其女。旣娶之後。入籍美國。不復回國。而美國政府亦擢用其人。任職於海軍。聞之鄉人告語。今已擢爲一艦隊之司令。則今日美國海軍之中。竟有吾華人任其司令者。此於吾國。固屬光榮。獨惜吾國海軍。一以缺乏軍艦。一以缺乏人材。遂至不能振作有爲。一與今日列强抗衡。其於美國旣得彼邦重用。至獲不次遷擢。任爲艦隊司令。當必爲海軍人材。吾國有此人材。楚材乃爲晉用。此則不禁爲吾國大可惜者。吉福先生去世以來。尙只十六七年。而其妻室猶在。其於母氏時有書至。而其母氏亦有書往。但不回國。大约將於美國安富尊榮畢其生。無復回國之一日矣。</p>

<p>梅蘭芳之刺虎</p>
<p>刺虎一劇。本出崑劇鐵冠圖。述費宫人忍死偷生。以圖一逞。報君國之仇。於萬一之際。其中含有萬不得已之情緒。蓋以弱女子而操刃殺賊。固非易易。此劇爲崑曲著戲。能者甚多。然於表演之際。每患其未能盡情。蓋此劇之含藴旣深。非再三致意。自不易爲力也。</p>
<p>客年梅蘭芳劇團赴美。成績婓然。昭在人口。而剌虎一齣。幾爲冠軍。案梅氏於籌備之時。以所演各劇非細加研究。不輕易登台。此劇論者以爲原本編製。盡善盡美倘再加致意於表情動作。俾其絲絲入扣則成爲世界名劇。無俟贅言。梅頷其說。因於身段做法。每立新意。故前後雖重要者只一塲。然神情俱到。無懈可撃。回國曾在平出演。不及往觀。乍來海上。得聆妙奏。回思旦在國外盛名之立。爲不虚矣。</p>
<p>戲劇之難能可貴。首在本事之有意義。次在編製之合宜。剌虎當之。庶無愧色。蓋中國劇年代湮遠。考證難詳。演諸舞台。難興觀感。剌虎即明末清初。相距尙遠。故事實搬演。尙有近代劇之精神。又中國素以宗法禮敎廉頑立懦爲立國之本。此劇以北女子奮不顧身。爲國雪恥。殊足表示東方民族之精神。而全劇本一悲劇。演之自屬沈雄。至編製則更不蔓不枝。且精且約。無勞觀者之旁騖四馳。俾得引起人精神集中之感。况以蘭芳演來。重加整理。心細如髮。宜觀者之滿意。以成功爲不虚。蓋於此一則可覘其聲容之並茂。再可進以探求改造舊劇之進步。吾知新派舊派之劇學家。於其再度出演。必更潛心研精不僅以觀劇相號召而已也。</p>

<p>— 孫文蔚</p>
<p>月之某日。表弟徐君邦達。與陳斐雲女士假座普益代辦所結婚。證婚人乃當代金石家四明趙叔孺先生。三時禮成。儀式極佳。海上書畫家佳作不少。琳榔滿壁。目不暇給。若沈淇泉太史聯集元稹吳融句去。得成蝴蜨尋花樹。莫羨鴛鴦入畫圖。尤爲出色。褚禮堂篆聯集漢鏡文云。壽如金石佳且好。長宜子孫樂未央。劉未林句云。吳岳曉光連翠　。玉峯晴色上朱欄。吳湖帆馮超然合贈聯云。百年歌好合。五世卜其昌。字係湖帆書者。隸大逾碗。極爲壯觀。黄曉汀山水小幅。仿燕文貴長卷一角。題錦繡山河四字。姚虞琴雙鉤設色蘭花立幅。題曰。好風吹放並頭花。丁耘軒鴛鴦芙蓉小幅。題曰鴛鴦介福。方介堪字幅。集漢八子九孫鏡銘。文長不錄。趙雪侯芙蓉老少年小幅。題曰。榮華偕老。陳巨來朱白小印兩方。白文徐旁。朱文孚尹。篆法高古。深得秦鉢堂奥。婚書爲尺頁式。首幅趙叔孺福祿鴛鴦四大篆字。次幅即褚禮堂隸文。吉月令辰。昏禮旣肅。百年偕老。永受胡福十六字。其次幅馮超然萱花。題昔人句曰。忘憂草。女兒花。青堂蠲忿不如他。宜種五侯家。再次幅爲主婚人證婚人等名。亦禮堂先生書也。可謂别開生面之婚書矣。邦達畫山水從李醉石。畫人物從俞滌煩。篆法從趙叔孺。心悟神會。日進千里。後起之秀。洵屬難得。無師之詩。亦清新可誦。天資之頴慧可知矣。</p>

<p>又見數人圍于一處而觀。一人以針爲人穿手法。用彩色油漆于針上。剌入皮膚。盡作種種形。所謂文身者也。其法多像動物鳥獸蟲類之形。或爲蛇蜈蚣之類。中國北部甚少。過淮南間有之。閩粤盛行海外甚多。蓋不穿衣之民。則以皮膚花紋爲美。因之成一種迷信。又爲一種社會之表象。大抵在中國則勞働及江浙社會居多。此地不知也。</p>
<p>此間婦女穿鼻耳之風盛。但似多印度吉能人。而缅人較少。其穿耳有穿豁者。耳大受傷。乃蠻俗也。此間男女新派者亦剪髮。舊派則否。如中土然。</p>
<p>仰光房舍不如檳城。較爲舊式。新嘉坡壯麗。檳城清雅而較窄小矣。仰光則更遜。因星洲檳城均新闢之殖民地。而仰光乃古都會也。新嘉坡華人四十萬。檳城只當其三之一。至仰光華人僅萬餘耳。商會學校規模均遜于彼等多矣。仰光入夜大金塔與白塔均安電燈。發光甚似上海先施永安兩公司。不過佛塔之感化力。無形中究不小也。</p>

<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>巡禮意大利日記</p>
<p>（三）羅馬十日（十）（二）</p>
<p>六月四日——大伽藍聖彼得——梵諦剛敎王宫——西施庭敎堂——</p>
<p>梵諦剛Vatian敎王宫是世界有名的寳庫。在羅馬城的西方。帝白河的右岸。摩天的聖彼得寺就聳在前面。那兒有不少的詭異的偉大的建築。雕刻。圖畫振動世人。最負盛名的是聖彼得寺的建築和西施庭Sistina的壁畫。聖彼得是基督的十二使徒中的最著名的一個。受了基督的使命在羅馬盛傳敎遵。終竟也就爲神而犧牲了。他的遺骸就葬在羅馬。傳說聖彼得的墳墓上面二世紀那時候。就造有一敎堂。到四世紀君士坦丁大帝公許基督敎爲國敎以後。就於彼得的墓上重新建起比較壯觀的敎堂。裝飾敎堂内部的雲石。均運自海特倫帝Hadrianus陸墓。</p>
<p>一千五百年敎皇徐洛二世JuliusII把這彼得寺的聖殿擴大起來。請當時的大建築師勃萊曼特Bramante開始計劃。不幸這偉大的工作未經完成而勃萊曼特死了。後來到敎皇萊翁十世Liox歷經拉飛爾Raphael彌克朗琪羅Michclangelo諸大師的修補。最後完成於勃尼尼Bernini互百餘年之歲月。經多數名師之圖案。而成功這建築史上最莊大的盛觀。現在我姑廻想我們參拜這世界第一大神殿的光景。</p>
<p>羅馬的烈。閃閃地正注在乾燥的街市上的時候。我們整裝走出旅館。從映着陽光的滿舖着石板的廣塲坐了MP電車逕赴梵諦剛。走了十分鐘光景已經到了電車的盡頭了。一下車。眺望便忽然開拓了。一片白石的平壤。正中樹立着方尖的石表。高到天邊觸到雲際。左右分立兩座大噴水池。那數十丈高的大噴霧洪水似的向上頭汎濫着。映射着太陽的光。我們欣欣然走到這廣塲。周圍是無數巨石的圓柱四重分列着供如廻廓。正中忽有高四百呎的如山的大穹窿巍然聳立於太空之下。輝耀燦爛。這就是聖彼得寺的圓頂。我當時就默想。能夠想那奇詭而雄大的構想的。一定是偉大的米克朗琪羅罷。依後來考據所得。這果然是米克朗琪羅的奇構。我們含着滿足的熱望又徐徐地走上幾十級石階就是聖彼寺的大門。這大門的前廊是有二十四根。廊柱作二排分列着。每個柱頭高一百六十五呎。其面積可容十五人的環抱。柱都用花崗石砌成的。在這巨大的圓柱之間而回顧兩邊柱廊的時候。不論是誰。總要發一聲驚歎。</p>
<p>這様大的柱頭並列而支撑着巨石構成的屋梁。屋沿上面立着基督及其十二徒的巨大石像他那嵯峨莊大。直是呀以誇耀千古建築的偉觀了。</p>

<p>— 樓金聲</p>
<p>在這三個月來、不想接連着開了二三個繪畫展覽會、這是很可喜的、在最近閘北江灣路上海藝術專科學校又舉行一繪畫展覽會、日期是本月十一日起、陳列學生成績敎員作品以及日本作家作品計有八百幾十件、校長王道源氏聞留學日本東京美專有年、敎授方面、如陳抱一、朱應鵬、倪貽德、都是聞名的作家、更有日本作家的作品加入展覽、是一個很可看的展覽會、</p>
<p>我在十一日上午九時、就怱怱地趕去了、那時一切還没有佈置齊全不過畫卻是都掛好的了、因此還不致於落空、作品中陳抱一氏的風景、他的作品的風格趣味還没有變動、仍是喜用綠色、粗粗的筆觸、有一幀小的風景、畫得非常好、畫中的水光山色、都異常震撼人、很複雜、但是他處置得很好、仍是用一種從容輕快的筆觸在畫的、覺得作者是値得人佩服的、其次倪貽德君的畫、他的作風大變動了、用大的筆觸、用單純的顔色、「食具」是最好的一幀、近來常同朋友談起、畫家、最困難的時候、是在他已經有十多年白研究、一個人到了這個時候、很少有進步、舉目看我們目前的藝壇上最多這種人物、這是頂悲哀的、因爲他已被他自已所學到的縛住自已的手足了、所以我對於倪貽德君改變他的作風、我覺得這是一個好的辦法、</p>
<p>關於王道源氏的作品、池表現的方法是很特異的、有一幀日本婦人像、　的用筆美極了、一幀中國女八像、女人臉的畫法、覺得是有卓越的、惟我覺得有時畫面上似欠清潔、惟「靈隠道中」一幀、少見這一種病了、朱應鵬氏之「地母」、另有一種趣味、地母的臉畫得很動人、</p>
<p>關於日本畫家中有一幀「裸女」及「蘇州河埠」、作者名已忘、「裸女」　情表露出畫室中的暖味、「蘇州河埠」用一種陰沉的色調、表現方法也很新穎、</p>
<p>看過了展覽會後、心内想着了各種的事、覺得現在關於繪畫方面的文字太少了、眞是太寂寞了、因此不顧自已的淺陋、便做起了這一篇文章、</p>

<p>— 謝海燕</p>
<p>日本通信</p>
<p>東京府美術館的石階、及前面的廣塲上、早已雜踏地擠滿了人、除多量的男子觀客之外、還有三兩隊女學生和小學的兒童、没有見過的人、一定覺得好笑、小孩子懂得什麽、也這様高興地看展覽會來、其實、在美育普遍的日本、這並不算是一件希罕的事情的、我們没步於街上、公園、海濱、或野外、隨時隨地、都可以發見三兩個兒童、站着蹲着、或坐着、一隻手握着筆、一隻手拿着畫板、塗紅抹綠地在那裏對着自然寫生的、他們有的寫得很不壞、全是無邪的天眞的流露、並且、也曉得一點畫學的常識、光和色的關係、及透視原理等、有一天、我到日比谷公園逛去、偶抬頭看見一大簇人圍成一個弧形的肉屏風、聚精會神地在鑑賞一位似乎是美術學校的學生、在描寫那高聳的公會堂、</p>
<p>「…………畫得不錯呢、不過、色彩與調子……你看怎様、」</p>
<p>「對啦、空氣大概他是不注意到的……」由人叢裏鑽出兩個不很小的小學生來、在歸途中下了這様刻骨的批評、不禁把我愕呆了、無奇不有、小孩子也會曉得什麽呌做調子、又什麽呌做空氣來、這是今年二月間的事、這事給我的印象很深、到現在還是記得着的、</p>
<p>日本美術之都的上野、照例、缺時不缺月地常有大小美術團體的展覽會、繼續輪着開、自開幕之日起、到閉幕之日止、没有一個展覽會不雜充着諸如此類的小觀客的、他們照様地拿着一小册子目鋒、和一枝小鉛筆、從會塲裏的第一室着起、一幅一幅地虚心靜氣去獨賞、他們覺得美麗的自已所喜歡的畫、便在目錄上畫個圈子做記號、更好的便接連畫了好幾個圈子、反之、給他們認爲壞的不好看的自已所厭惡的畫、便在該條名稱姓氏上畫個×字碼、表示不滿、年齡較長的孩子、照様畫着圈子或×字碼之外、並在目錄旁邊、註錄幾句對於該畫批評的意見、說到他們的觀賞法、也是很老鍊的、他們曉得向前去研究細部調子的筆觸和色彩的均配、又曉得往後退來囑覽全畫的結構及色彩的總和、時而向前、時而退後、時而掩閉一眼、時而以手作望遠鏡狀、極盡鑑賞的能事、於此、我們可見日本國民審美之一斑了、</p>
<p>不過、我並不願意和小孩子、尤其是成羣的小孩子在一室裏看畫的、他們要是有同伴做一起、是最嘈不過、而且要横衝直撞的、幸而、今天雖同時巧逢着這幾隊魚貫向進口處傾入的小學生但他們都向左轉、先到第一部日本畫陳列室去的、我們則先由右方的第二部西洋畫看起、</p>
<p>一進室内、不由地感到一種陰鬱濃漫的空氣、像鑽進了一個黑黝黝的洞穴、無從找到一處光明似的、說明白點、就是現今的帝展、已經達到非常庸俗腐化的尖端了、他們—帝展的作家們、因爲要圖享官立展覽會、給與一切優遇的利益、因而傾全力於表皮粉飾運動、藉吸引一般普通人—外行者的拜服、更加鞏固其自已多年所築上來的牙城的基礎、這種無聊的錯誤、結果、産出這兩種自掘墳墓的禍胎來、</p>
<p>一思想的頑固化、和</p>
<p>二技術的平俗化、</p>
<p>帝展—乃至其前身—文展（即文部）省美術展覽會、始創於明治末葉四十年、棺沿至大正八年、始在熱狂的改遙論商、潮之下、成立帝國美術院、改文　爲帝展）自創立迄今、已持有二十餘年的悠久歷史、但傳統的時代思想的反抗集團、創立之初、對於印象派Lmpressibnism以後的畫風、是異端歧視的、假如非寫實主義Realism官學派Academy一類的作品、是少能幾乎可以褒是絕對不能入選的、後來、新進的作家們、對於審查員鑑查之不講、因而有革命的二科曹之設、糾合問志、揭起「反官展」的旗、脫離從前洋畫界滯存底單絕的、敎條的、非個性的羈絆而走上眞的、興趣的、自由的、個性光明藝術之路、</p>
<p>到中途—帝展的初期、雖然漸漸爲時代所屈服、而改換其鑑查的方針、對於文展時候所不能通過入選的作品、也酌量挅納、給與二科會先見的勝利、然而、對於最急進的畫派、如立體派Cubism未來派Euturism構成派Cnstruotivisme表現派Expressionion超現實派Surrealisme等派、不採納的主張、到現在還是墨守着的、本來政府的事業、不能比一般事業激進的原故、大概也自有其不得已的理由在、但是如果離時代太遠了、我却以爲不應該、（未完）</p>

<p>— 雲</p>
<p>暮色昏沉、天空緊刮着北風、飯堂裏人影依稀、祇有我們幾十人分佔着約摸十桌的位子在吃晚飯、這因爲今天是星期六、她們有家在上海的或有地方走的、都已出外去外了、所以祗剩着我們幾十人疏疏落落地在晚餐、</p>
<p>餐後更覺得無聊、同房間裏的四位出去還没有回來、她們是有家在上海的、大概今晚是不會回來了的吧、剩下的還有兩位、而她們却又是初中裏的同學、又不能夠和她們說什麽、眞是悶氣、悶得我心坎裏充滿了一切的雜想、難過極了、而我想把這種雜想抑制住、那知愈想抑制它、而夾雜的思慮、却愈來愈多、我没有方法、我遂靜情情地踱到没半個人影兒的敎室裏去、但没一刻的時光、驀地裏來了我的同班的蜜司周蜜司李和蜜司林、她們嘻嘻哈哈地推進了門、我到不覺被她們嚇了一跳、</p>
<p>「蜜司王、你好閑適、一個人躲在這兒、在想什麽喲、在想你的他嗎」、蜜司李看到我的時候、她嘻皮笑臉地搶着就這様地問、接着蜜司周說、</p>
<p>「害得我們好尋喲、跑到你的貴房間、走了個空、原來你在這兒、想什麽喲」、</p>
<p>「想什麽、你們也和我玩笑嗎、我有什麽心事不能告訴你們的、還不是想着我們昨天所談的那個問題嗎」、</p>
<p>「你們昨天談什麽喲、我不、你們騙着我在談什麽不給我知道的話」、蜜司林像孩子般地撤嬌着說、</p>
<p>「蜜司林老是像孩子様的、又是孩子氣發作了、你自已跑什麽地方去了、我們到那兒來找你」、蜜司李和她爭吵着說、</p>
<p>「算了吧、讓我來告訴你、昨天傍晚、我和蜜司李散步在校園裏的時光、忽然碰到蜜司周和蜜司卜也在校園中散步、四人成羣、我們就坐在校園裏討論起來、大概是關於我們的將來、談到將來的問題、實在是麻煩極了、使我們無從講起、我們昨天談了一兩個鐘頭、一點結果都没有談出、我們是從最近的將來談起的、但這、就是一個可怕的將來、我們此刻都是高中師範將畢業的、那末我們最近將來的問題、自然就是畢業後的問題、這是如何難堪的一個問題喲」、</p>
<p>「對呀、我的家庭不客氣地講一句、固然是小康之家、然因家裏的人太多、而我升學的希望、大概是要成爲絕望了、這並不是我不願意而不願去求高深的學問、實在是環境逼迫我、我是要使你們失望了、我要趨於落伍者了、但望你們勿抛棄我、或許我的心還是不肯落伍的、有形的大學敎育、我雖没有享受的資格、但實際的高深學問、却是誰都不能夠阻止我去研究」、蜜司林說到這裏、她的眼圈已呈紅色、似乎快要流下淚了、接着蜜司周也興奮地說出、</p>

<p>們鄰年老丁、望你也能體諒兩老的心、早日地了結我倆的心願、不要再如此堅决地關着還要讀書、」我的回答是、「爹爹、媽媽、請你不要講這些話吧、我的一生我自已是曉得的、我總聽命你們、請你們放心、」所以在這次高中師範的畢業後、我是不能再逆意子、我明知道即使再去鬥氣的話、恐怕亦是得不到勝利的、反不如暫時終止我的求學吧、同時爲顧到經濟問題、我想去服務一年再說、但此後能否想法繼續地升學、自然是成問題了、」</p>

<p>哦、我知道了、包君、這並不是我没有勇氣去做、實在是社會能力不允許我這様做呀、經濟條件不允許我這様做呀、可憐處在這種舊社會中、兼之我又是一個窮措大、這様、我是没有資格去愛我所欲愛的人的呀、</p>
<p>唉唉、包君、我記起了、你從前曾對我說過的、你的意思以爲戀愛的先决條件、是應當先將生活問題解决開來、否則徒託空言而已、自已餓肚、那是不能怨誰得來、若娶了女人、她也跟着自已餓肚、　　　　接第九版</p>

<p>我好幾次都想向她猛烈的進攻、先和她開口說話、但是、我是一個怯懦者、我是一個安分守已的人、在我還没有開口向她說話以前、我的内心便忐忑的跳躍、我面頰上便頓時露出紅量來、我到了這時、我是羞恥到無地可以容身、這様我那裏還有開口向她說話的勇氣呢、</p>
<p>有一次、有　一個極好的機會、我和她在馬路上碰着、她還連連的向我漂了幾眼、將我的全身打量了一下、似乎要想和我說話的様子（我不敢說、她預備和我說話、故用「要想」兩字、）這在有勇氣的人、早已經迎上前去和她打招呼了、可是、我呀、包君、我原是一個怯懦的人、可憐到了這種時期反只有偈小兎也似的逃竄開來、我是不敢昧冒走上前去、厚臉的和她打招呼、這是眞是坐失良機了呀、這我眞是坐失良機了呀、</p>
<p>自從這次以後、我到法國公園裏去、我再看不到她麗影了、唉唉、她竟棄絕了我嗎、抑還是埋怨我太怯懦了呢、再不然、難道她患病了嗎、……可憐的我呀、竟不能直接的跑到××路一百六十一號裏當面詢問她一下、究竟爲什麽原因不到法國公園裏來、我是無從知曉、這時的我、眞是苦痛到極點了呀、</p>

After lengthy consultations between the two sides, the company side requested to continue the management of telegram transmission and reception and to extend the landing period by 20 years. They firmly refused to compromise on other issues. Our side believes that self-management is essential for transmission and reception, and the landing period will not be relaxed based on the original plan. Therefore, there was no result. Our side finally stated that the two sides have been meeting for several months, and our side has always strived for an early resolution. However, the companies have too many concerns and have failed to compromise, resulting in a failure to close the gap in opinions. It is hoped that the representatives will reconsider the entire case and come to Beijing for another conference. (Special Dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) After the Navy's Desheng and Weisheng ships defeated the Communist bandits in Tianjiazhen and Shazhen, the Desheng ship was stationed in Wuxue on the 12th, and the Weisheng ship protected the ships transporting the army.

They then approached the shore and used machine guns to strafe the bandits. After carefully inspecting the near shore, they found that there were no more Communist bandits, so they returned to Qichun to find the transport ships and continued forward, then landed from Huangsang Estuary.

<h3 id="e17">The Peace Talk of Americans and Germans <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Former U.S. Secretary of State Kellogg, at the ceremony for receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, delivered a speech stating that the time for the great powers to fulfill their arms reduction guarantees had arrived and that the evil demons of arms race competition could be swept away on the avenue of culture. And German scientist Dr. Albert Einstein, in a speech in the United States, said that if the United States truly desires to seek peace, its power is sufficient to break the tradition of militarism that harms Europe and the world and prevent the recurrence of war. Dr. Einstein's statement seeks to place the responsibility for peace on the United States. However, in reality, the responsibility for peace rests entirely on the combined efforts of all countries in the world and can never be achieved by the power of any one country. Looking at the current situation in Europe, the reason why this stalemate has formed is certainly not due to the power of one or two countries. For example, in the disputes of the Arms Reduction Preparatory Committee, both sides accuse the other of lacking sincerity in arms reduction. In reality, both sides are unwilling to implement arms reduction. However, it is not that they truly do not want to implement arms reduction. They are all suspicious that the other side cannot implement it, and therefore dare not relax their own armaments. Furthermore, driven by the increasingly severe economic situation, they all want to compete for survival and extricate themselves in this trend. This suspicion is thus intensified, and armaments are even more reluctant to be reduced. Therefore, in all fairness, today's countries all have intentions for peace and are extremely obedient to peace, but they are all hindered by facts and cannot proceed on the path to peace. This is why, on the one hand, talk of peace is sung higher and higher, while on the other hand, the crisis of war is approaching closer and closer. At this time, if one or two war-mongering countries arise in the midst, this peaceful situation will be immediately shattered. Therefore, today's world, if there are still war-mongering countries with eager hearts and gambling on chance, I sincerely hope that they will suddenly reflect and think deeply.</p>

<p>Focusing on coexistence and co-prosperity</p>
<p>Will Negotiate with Our Side</p>
<p>Dentsu 12th Tokyo Dispatch: Kimura Eiichi, the director of the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu) who returned to Japan, discussed with Army Minister Ugaki yesterday regarding the countermeasures policy for the Manchuria and Mongolia railway network plan, and a general agreement was reached. Director Kimura returned to his post today and began railway negotiations with the Liaoning authorities. The government also reported to the cabinet meeting today, and Foreign Minister Shidehara instructed Ambassador Shigemitsu and Consul-General Hayashi in Fengtian to thoroughly implement the Japanese policy. The main points of the countermeasures are: (1) The Chinese side's parallel line construction plan for Mantetsu contradicts the statement made by the Chinese plenipotentiary during the Beijing consultation in the 38th year of Meiji (1905), and it is a clear violation of the treaty, which should be carefully considered by China; (2) For railway plans other than parallel lines, Japan, which hopes for the economic development of Manchuria and Mongolia, will not only not obstruct them, but also intends to provide railway materials and approve construction loans to assist them. Japan always adheres to the principle of coexistence and co-prosperity, willing to accept the minimum limits, and at the same time hopes that China will also adopt a reasonable principle of mutual concession. The negotiation is scheduled to begin on the 13th or 14th.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency 12th Tokyo Dispatch: The specific content of Japan's negotiation policy for the Manchurian Railway is roughly as follows: (1) For the Northeast Railway issue, it will be treated as a local issue and negotiated with the Liaoning authorities first. If the Liaoning side insists on negotiating with the central government, it will also negotiate with the Nanjing National Government; (2) The Jihai Line connection line, etc., has been mostly completed, and tacit approval is unavoidable. The new construction of other nurturing lines for the aforementioned line will be absolutely prohibited; (3) The above is based on the legitimate claim of treaty rights under Article 3 of the supplementary agreement to the 1905 Beijing Treaty, which is a matter of life and death for the Japanese national economic activity, and this claim must not be yielded; (4) If the Chinese side refuses to agree under any circumstances, the Japanese side will also demand the right to lay Mantetsu nurturing lines.</p>
<p>Reuters 12th Tokyo Dispatch: Today, all newspapers here published extensively about China's construction of railway procedures in the three eastern provinces, and are concerned about China's increasingly intrusive attitude towards Japan. According to several newspapers, the Japanese government is now at the end of its patience and intends to deal with China with a more resolute attitude. However, regarding the railway issue in the three eastern provinces, the authorities claim that this news is purely fabricated. However, according to a key source, Kimura, the president of the South Manchuria Railway, went to Dalian yesterday after consulting with the government in Tokyo. After receiving Kimura's report, the South Manchuria Railway Company will discuss with the Chinese authorities in Shenyang to see if China and Japan can change from competition to cooperation, then there is plenty of room for mutually beneficial development in the three eastern provinces. Although the Japanese government does not want to directly negotiate this matter with China now, it is heard that the diplomatic and consular representatives in China have been instructed by the government to assist the South Manchuria Railway Company when it needs assistance, so that the railway issue can be resolved satisfactorily.</p>

<h3 id="e49">World Sugar Panic <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Due to Over Supply</p>
<p>Germany Asks for Increased Export Quota</p>
<p>Reuters 11th Beijing Dispatch: The International Sugar Conference is now paying attention to the causes of the world sugar panic. Looking at the numbers of world production and consumption, the reason can be known. In 1929-30, sugar production totaled 27,000,000 tons, while in the 1912-22 sugar season, sugar production was 18,250,000 tons. Estimate</p>
<p>In the fourteen months before the end of October 1931, consumption in eleven European countries was approximately 1,134,000 tons. According to the report of the Statistics Committee, in the 1930-31 sugar season, European countries had 2,184,000 tons of sugar available for export, while in 1929-30, the net export of sugar in the sugar industry was only 1,445,000 tons. Today, representatives from Germany, Java, the United States, and Cuba discussed Germany's request to increase the export quota. Representatives from other countries considered this request to be too high. Representatives from Cuba and Java said that they are currently complying with restrictions on sugar production, but Germany alone is asking for an increase in the export quota, which is somewhat inappropriate. The meeting had no results. Representatives from Cuba and Java proposed that countries in Europe that produce excess beet sugar should reduce raw sugar exports by 15% of the previous season's exports. Reuters 11th Batavia Dispatch: It is learned that the Cuba-Java sugar contract signed in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, stipulates that Java sugar production will be reduced by 11.72%, and Cuban sugar production will be reduced by 23.5%. Both parties are now striving to make European sugar producers reduce their sugar production by 20.5%. The manager of the Dutch Trading Company in Batavia, Taike Nateer, will now depart for China to protect the interests of Javanese sugar exporters, because there are rumors that China will grant preferential tax rates to the Cuban sugar industry. The sugar trust has decided to temporarily suspend sales.</p>

<p>Massachusetts Trust Company Still Closed</p>
<p>Reuters 11th New York Dispatch: Important New York bankers gathered at the New York Federal Reserve Bank this morning due to a run on several branches of the Union Bank. The Union Bank is one of the smaller and more recently established banks in New York, and has no relationship with the US government. According to the bank's staff, the bank originally intended to merge with several other banks, but the negotiations failed, causing panic in the outside world. This morning, the Union Bank's head office and branches posted notices of suspension of business, stating that the bank is now being handled by the state banking department. Also, it is telegraphed that as soon as the Union Bank's suspension notice was posted, the bank supervisor announced that important New York banks had agreed to lend more than 100 million yuan to stop the run. It is found that 100 million yuan can offset half of the deposits.</p>
<p>Reuters 12th Massachusetts, Springfield Dispatch: The state bank supervisor has temporarily taken over the West Springfield Trust Company. The bank did not open yesterday after a run occurred due to the suicide of an accountant.</p>

<p>Little Accomplishment at the Disarmament Preparatory Meeting</p>
<p>Difficult to Break the Militaristic Concept</p>
<p>Associated Press 11th New York Dispatch: Famous German scientist Dr. Albert Einstein arrived here today, planning to go to the Wilson Mountain Observatory in California to participate in ongoing experiments, and to investigate physics research at American colleges and universities. The doctor earnestly stated that his theory of relativity does not conflict with the theories of Newton and other famous physicists of the past. In fact, his theory is based on Newton's theory, but it takes three days of detailed explanation for ordinary people to understand. The doctor did not want to discuss European politics with people, but when mentioning international relations, he earnestly spoke of peace, saying that if the United States really wants to seek peace, it has the power to break the militaristic tradition that harms Europe and the world. If the United States truly wants to end war, its economic and political status can prevent war from ever happening again.</p>
<p>National News Agency 11th Oslo Dispatch: Former US Secretary of State Kellogg received the Nobel Peace Prize at the university here today. The Norwegian King and Crown Prince, and the diplomatic corps all attended the ceremony. In his speech, Kellogg solemnly reaffirmed the moral obligation of the great powers to fulfill the disarmament guarantees of the Treaty of Versailles. The time has come to clear the demons of arms competition on the avenue of civilization. He hopes that the Disarmament Conference can realize mankind's ardent desire to reduce armaments, so as not to have little accomplishment like the Disarmament Preparatory Conference. The second award recipient was Archbishop Souter Bylon, whose speech urged the world to maintain peace and work together to eliminate the roots of hatred, with extremely sincere and moving words.</p>

<p>Declare that Any Agreement Cannot Bind Parliament</p>
<p>Reuters 11th London Dispatch: Churchill said in his speech that the British government and the Indian government only responded to the absurd demands of the North Indian extremists with soft words and gentle phrases. It is now appropriate to reiterate in clear terms that Britain does not want to abandon the actual power to manage the lives and progress of Indians. The Round Table Conference has no power to create a constitution. Any agreement reached at the Round Table Conference cannot morally or legally bind Parliament. When the Indian Government Act is submitted to Parliament, the new Lower House will already exist, and it will decide how to handle it at that time. The Conservative Party is free to terminate or change its course. The Conservative Party should limit the powers of the All-India group, and instead establish more genuine representative autonomous bodies in the provinces. When it develops, this autonomous body can become a more stable foundation for the All-India government, which cannot be reached by the current crude and awkward Westernized concepts. Now 24,000 Indian politicians or puppets of politicians have been placed in prison, and disturbances everywhere have been quelled. Britain should exercise its power in practice. Any concessions allowed by the Labor government are sufficient for the Indian revolutionary party to use as a starting point for new demands. In summary, Gandhism must be eliminated sooner or later. It is useless to feed a tiger with cat food and seek its satisfaction.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Problem of Foreign Minister Shidehara as Acting Prime Minister <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Future Disputes Inevitable</p>
<p>Dentsu 12th Tokyo Dispatch: The three members of the Minseito Party, Wakatsuki, Sanmi, and Sengoku, took the public's intentions into account and vigorously supported Foreign Minister Shidehara, whom the party had rejected, to act as prime minister, which aroused the opposition of the party. Regarding this matter, Sengoku told reporters that he said that it is said that non-party members cannot act as prime minister during parliamentary sessions. Where does this saying come from? If they cannot act as prime minister, then ministers cannot be members of political parties. It is only a band that implements policies for the sake of convenience. What's so great about it? Also, the three men will invite Foreign Minister Shidehara to Sengoku's residence in Fujimicho, Azabu, tonight to persuade him to continue to act as prime minister in order to seek peace within the party. Meanwhile, the anti-Shidehara faction in the Minseito Party will also hold a discussion meeting at the Tokyo Hall in Marunouchi to discuss countermeasures for the current situation based on the principle of respecting party members. The issue of Foreign Minister Shidehara acting as prime minister has become the focus of the political situation.</p>
<p>Dentsu 12th Tokyo Dispatch: A few young members of the Minseito Party will meet at the Tokyo Hall tonight to discuss the impeachment of the three elders, Yamamoto, Wakatsuki, and Sengoku, for their strong support of Shidehara's attitude. The main points of the impeachment are as follows: The elders are originally in an advisory position and only wait for the party's consultation to decide whether or not it is feasible. Now, regarding the issue of the acting president, they are visiting Saionji or summoning Shidehara to decide the acting issue arbitrarily, which is an act of exceeding their authority, and it is to slight the Minseito Party executives and the Minseito Party as a whole. The Minseito Party should reset a better plan.</p>

<p>Resolves Concrete Measures for Suppressing Bandits</p>
<p>Various Sectors Jointly Launch Large-Scale Petition</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is in Jiangxi presiding over the suppression of bandit communists. All circumstances are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Military Conference at the Headquarters: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek convened a military conference at approximately 6:00 PM on the 9th within the Provincial Library at Baihua Zhou, attended by generals including He Chengjun, Zhu Shaoliang, Lu Diping, Zhang Huizan, Luo Lin, Gong Bingfan, Deng Ying, Shao Lizi, Zhou Fohai, Xiao Wenduo, Liu Yi, and more than ten others. After the meeting commenced, Chairman Chiang first addressed and instructed the generals on strategies. Next, He and Lu reported on the bandit communist situation in the three provinces. Each division commander reported on defense and combat progress. After the reports, each proposal was discussed one by one, lasting three hours. Many important cases were passed. Concrete methods were established regarding troop deployment and communication, bandit suppression funding, and timelines for pacification. After the meeting adjourned, Chiang personally instructed each commander and division commander to return to defense immediately and diligently suppress according to the plan. That evening, Chiang also hosted a banquet for the generals.</p>
<p>Reward Offered for Capturing Bandit Leaders: Chairman Chiang telegraphed orders yesterday to commanders of all routes, offering rewards for capturing bandit leaders. The telegram roughly stated: "The National Army's suppression of communist bandits this time should be carried out with the determination to fundamentally eradicate them and save the people from fire and water. It is imperative to strictly supervise the troops, unite with allied forces, encircle and suppress, allowing no escape. If anyone destroys a bandit nest and captures Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, or any other important bandit leader, they will be rewarded with 50,000 yuan in silver. The same reward will be given for killing a bandit leader in battle and verifying the head beyond doubt. It is hoped that this will be relayed to all officers and soldiers for compliance."</p>
<p>Allocation of 100,000 for Emergency Relief: Chiang, recognizing the severity of the Jiangxi disaster, with hundreds of Jiangxi people's petition groups submitting over a hundred petitions, specially allocated 100,000 yuan to be handled by Chairman Lu for emergency relief. The remaining funds will be raised through other means. Lu has already handed over this sum to the provincial relief association for proper distribution.</p>
<p>Fujian Compatriots Petition: Fujian natives in Jiangxi, fearing that Zhu and Mao's bandits would soon flee to Fujian, launched a large-scale petition to dispatch troops to Fujian to block and suppress them. They gathered over three hundred people at the Fujian Guild Hall on Zhongshan Road, led by Zheng Zhongwu and Lai Weizhou, and stood vigil in front of the headquarters, sending Zheng and Lai to submit the petition. Chiang dispatched Chai Zuyin to meet with them. Zheng and Lai requested the swift dispatch of troops to Fujian to block Zhu and Mao and suppress the communist bandits. Chai agreed to relay the message to Chiang. Zheng, Lai, and others then went to the Sixth Route Headquarters to petition Zhu Shaoliang, hoping for a swift dispatch of Mao's troops to Fujian to suppress the bandits.</p>
<p>Various Sectors Petition Daily: Yesterday, those who went to the headquarters to petition included groups from Fenyi and Taihe counties, seventeen counties in southern Jiangxi, and the Guangxin seven-county native place association, all requesting troops and relief. The Provincial Federation of Commerce, the Provincial Federation of Education, the Municipal Federation of Education, the Municipal Student Union, various labor unions, and over a hundred industry associations also jointly launched a large-scale petition yesterday, with several hundred representatives. The petitioning masses were mostly in rags, and there were also several hundred women and children with gaunt faces. Petitioners held small flags, standing along Zhongshan Road next to the headquarters, stretching for about half a mile. Representatives Yan Chengyuan and Li Guanglie were selected as representatives, carrying a petition inside. Chiang also dispatched the chief of the Confidential Affairs Section to meet with them. Yan and Li stated the main points of the petition: (1) Eradicate the communist bandits; (2) Exempt disaster areas from taxes; (3) Provide relief to disaster victims; (4) Maintain education funding; (5) Clean up officialdom; (6) Severely punish corruption; (7) Abolish exorbitant taxes. The section chief agreed to relay them to Chairman Chiang for review and handling.</p>
<p>Instruction to Authorities of Three Provinces: Chairman Chiang instructed the party, government, and military authorities and the people of the three provinces on the 8th to unite in suppressing and eradicating the bandits. The original text is as follows: "This Commander-in-Chief, under the mandate of the Party and the Nation, is tasked with suppressing the communist bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, and also serves as commander to oversee the local party and government personnel to advance troops immediately. The points to note regarding the suppression of the communist are hereby cautioned in advance, and it is hoped that everyone will respectfully comply. It has been found that the communist bandits, taking advantage of the emptiness in the rear after the rebellions of Ge and Feng, have spread rampantly in the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, slaughtering and burning, causing villages to be ruined and deaths to pile up. What have the common people done to deserve such a calamity? Now the Central Government has dispatched a large army to encircle and suppress on all sides, aiming for a fundamental eradication to curb social chaos. However, in order to achieve a thorough and effective eradication in the shortest possible time, it is necessary for responsible personnel from all political and military sectors to have a firm and unwavering heart and the intention to eliminate evil thoroughly, earnestly take responsibility, and work together to achieve success. Hereby, the points that responsible personnel from all sectors should pay attention to are specially explained, and it is necessary to be vigilant and implement them. Military responsible personnel should uphold the spirit of revolutionary soldiers, obey orders, and strictly carry out tasks. Although the orders of superiors are difficult, they must be obeyed. Although the assigned tasks are arduous, they must be accomplished. There must be no perfunctory or procrastinating behavior, nor should there be excuses or embellishments. Many of the troops tasked with suppressing the communist often act perfunctorily, fulfilling their duties superficially, not striving to pursue and thoroughly eradicate. When the bandits retreat, they report eradication; when the bandits escape, they claim elimination, deceiving superiors and deceiving society. Such temporary embellishments lead to endless troubles. This bad habit must be corrected immediately. In the future, the troops tasked with suppressing the communist must thoroughly eradicate the communist bandits. The troops assigned to advance and suppress a certain route or group of communist bandits must pursue and block them until the day that the route or group is fundamentally eliminated, which will be considered the completion of the troops' mission. The task of the troops will not end until the communist bandits are completely eradicated. It is absolutely not permissible to report success because the communist bandits have temporarily escaped, nor can responsibility be relinquished because the communist bandits have withdrawn from the defensive areas. Anyone who procrastinates or fabricates false reports will be severely punished upon discovery. Discipline is the soul of the army and should be especially strengthened. Wherever the army goes, there should be fair trade, and the bad habits of conscripting laborers and forcibly occupying civilian houses must be strictly prohibited, so that the communist bandits will lose the opportunity to incite and agitate. Politically responsible personnel should know that the army's suppression of the communist is to quell the chaos after it has occurred, not to prevent it before it happens. The only way to eliminate the source of chaos is through politics. If the government does not strive to improve governance and politics are not reformed and revitalized, then even if the communist bandit uprisings are suppressed by military force for a time, it will be difficult to prevent them from taking advantage of opportunities to stir up trouble and revive from ashes. The provincial governments should formulate plans to revitalize politics, select honest and capable personnel to be responsible separately, and implement them step by step. On one hand, build a clean and honest government to clean up officialdom; on the other hand, investigate the household registration and strictly implement the Baojia system to maintain order in the local area. With the Baojia system in place, the local area will have the power of self-defense. With a clear household registration, bandits will have no place to hide. If the government is clean and honest, the communist bandits will also lose the resources for incitement and agitation. Party affairs responsible personnel should know that the rampant behavior of the communist bandits is a great shame to the party and its members. This alone is sufficient to prove the unsoundness of the party's various levels of party departments and the irresponsibility of party members. If the party departments were sound and party members worked hard, then why would there be the phenomenon of communist bandit uprisings? The communist bandits incite the masses, while our party members are separated from the masses. The communist party organizes the people, while our party departments are alienated from the people. What is the difference between handing soldiers to the bandits and providing food to the thieves? How can we blame the people for being deceived and their power spreading everywhere? Party members should realize the mistakes of the past and correct their past behavior. It is not enough to promote doctrines in words and speeches. It is especially important to practice what you preach, gain the trust of the masses with personal words and deeds, and make the people understand in practice that our party is working for the welfare of the people and not using the people as tools. Our party members are fulfilling obligations to the people, not exercising rights for the people. In the past, the actions of party members were improper, becoming a special class in society. How can we blame the people for feeling resentment towards the party and giving the communist bandits the opportunity to leave? This is something that our party members should seriously consider and reflect upon. Zhongzheng departs to supervise the troops with the determination to eradicate the communist bandits. Even if there are difficulties ahead, he will do his best to overcome them to achieve the final goal. He will never condone problems and allow them to fester, causing future troubles. As for the communist party members who regret their mistakes and return, they should recognize the errors of the past and be given a path to self-renewal. No one should be killed indiscriminately. Responsible personnel from all sectors should also know that the Central Government's suppression of the communist is actually to pacify the people, not to disturb them. Therefore, every action should be carefully considered. Do not involve the innocent in the suppression of the communist, and do not harm the good people. If the Central Government has the heart to pacify the people, but the local authorities are disturbing the people, it is violating the will of the Central Government. Responsible personnel from all sectors must not, because Zhongzheng is personally supervising the troops, assume that someone is in charge and shirk responsibility. It should be known that the suppression of the communist is a major matter, not a responsibility that one person can bear alone, nor can it be accomplished by the strength of one person alone. Everyone should bear their own responsibilities and do their best to work together with one heart and one mind, so that the communist bandits can be destroyed and the chaos can be quelled. Those who diligently and effectively complete their tasks will be heavily rewarded by the Central Government to show excellence. Those who are perfunctory, procrastinating, or using the name of suppressing the communist to disturb the people will be subject to party discipline and national laws. Once discovered, they will not be tolerated. This is a special instruction, and all should respectfully comply."</p>

<p>Bandits Show Signs of Fleeing Towards the Hubei Border</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: The communist bandit He Long, Kuang Jixun, led more than ten thousand men with about six or seven thousand guns. After entering Nanhua from Honghu, Hubei, and temporarily moving to the area of Jin, Feng, Shimen, and Linfeng, it has been over a month. In late November, they attempted to leave Linfeng and invade Changtao, the important town in western Hunan. He Jian received the news and urgently ordered the 19th Division Commander Li Jue to withdraw from Pingxiang and rush to Changde on the 29th to reinforce. He's bandits knew they were no match and retreated from Linfeng to Shimen. On the 2nd of this month, they again invaded Jinfeng from Shimen Xin'anhekou for the second time. At the same time, a part of the Kuang Jixun bandits who had infiltrated the border of Hubei also invaded Nanhua for the second time. At that time, there were no stationed troops in Nan County, so it was occupied by the communist bandits on the evening of the 2nd. County Magistrate Song Shoumei fled to the East Court. In the Jinfeng area, Chen Jingbei Commander Qu Zhen's units, Chen Yunkui and Tian Shaoqing's two regiments, and the Sichuan Army Ma Kunshan brigade were originally prepared to guard against Shimen. On the 2nd, the county seat of Fengzhou was suddenly surrounded by He's troops. Chen and Tian's two regiments closed the city and defended it. On the same night, another part of He's bandits, about five thousand men, chased to Jinshi and engaged in a fierce battle overnight with the Ma Kunshan brigade. Until the morning of the 3rd, the Ma brigade retreated to Xinzhou to await reinforcements due to being outnumbered. Jinshi was thus captured for the second time. Since the 4th, Nan County, Anxiang, Yuanjiang, and Hanshou counties along the lake have all telegraphed the province for emergency help. He Jian received the report and telegraphed Li Division Commander Jue, Chen Commander Qu Zhen, Zhang Division Commander Ying, and Dai Commander Huiyuan, ordering them to launch a large-scale encirclement of Jinfeng by a deadline. The above units are all under the command of Li Jue. On one hand, he telegraphed Xu Yuanquan Division Commander's Liu Peixu brigade stationed in the Jianli Gongshi area of Hubei to advance towards Huarong to block them. On the other hand, he telegraphed Chen Cheng Division, currently stationed in Yuezhou, to dispatch a part of them to advance along the lake from Yuezhou to reinforce Nanhua, and also transferred the Tao Liu brigade, which is currently suppressing bandits in Chaoyou, to return to the province by a deadline and go straight to Nanhua to suppress them. Except for the Nanhua side, the advancing troops are currently setting out and should arrive in about two or three days. As for the Jinfeng side, according to a telegram report from Li Division Commander Jue yesterday, the concentrated forces have reached a considerable location on the 5th and have decided to simultaneously mobilize on the 6th to launch a large-scale encirclement. The distribution of his troops is as follows: (1) The Sichuan Army Zhang Ying Division and Ma Kunshan brigade concentrated in Xinzhou, fifteen miles away from Jinshi, on the 5th. Zhang Ying took a boat from Anxiang to Xinzhou on the morning of the 5th to personally command and decided to attack Jinshi early on the 6th. (2) Chen Quzhen's Zhang Jinwu and Gu Jiaqi's two regiments and the Sichuan Army Zhou Xieqing brigade decided to launch a general attack on Shimen early on the 6th and ordered Shimen to be captured by the 7th, and then to pursue into Fengzhou. (3) Li Division Commander Jue himself departed from Changde on the 4th and arrived in Linfeng County on the 5th. He decided to personally lead the four regiments of the directly subordinate Deng Nanji brigade and the two regiments of Li Guojun's unit, and the two regiments of Dai Huiyuan's unit to attack Fengzhou on the 6th to relieve the siege of Feng. (4) The above encirclement formation, with the combined forces of internal and external encirclements, numbers over twenty regiments. The goal is to recover Jinfeng within five days, first defeating He's bandits, and then dividing the troops to assist in suppressing Kuang's bandits in Nanhua. In addition, Commander-in-Chief He was requested to dispatch two or three planes every day on the 6th and 7th to fly to Jinfeng to scout and bomb the bandit army, and also to telegraph He Director Chengjun to dispatch troops to block the bandits on the border of Hubei. On the evening of the 5th, He Jian received another telegram from Li Jue from Linfeng, stating that he had arrived in Lincheng on the day he sent the telegram, according to reports, He's bandits were in extreme shortage of bullets. When in Shimen, they collected saltpeter and sulfur and made gunpowder themselves, using bottles filled with gunpowder as bombs and bamboo tubes filled with gunpowder as cannons. This time they returned to Jinfeng and planned to flee north to the border of Hubei. At 4 p.m. on the 5th, aviation fourth team pilots Liu Jiongguang and others reported to He Jian that the bandits would flee back to Gongan, Hubei. The pilot had been flying a Dallas 4 aircraft at around 11 a.m. on the 5th to inspect the area around Changde and Jin Feng. At 3 p.m., they returned to the province, they found that Changde city was very peaceful, the line from the 7-mile bridge to the 10-mile shop north of it was heavily guarded by our army, and the troops of Linfeng were all set to be deployed. There were many people in Aoshan city. The order was orderly. A portion of the bandits near Fengzhou had already moved from Fengyang bridge northeast of the county through Shihui harbor. Xindian shop Zhang Yemao village moved toward Shunlin. It was found that they were still trying to return to An. There were about 3-400 bandits at the south of the Chenyan Puxi River across the river, and they were carrying packages and fleeing in the northwest direction along the North Avenue. The plane opened fire with a machine gun to shoot several hundred rounds, and there were many killings. Others were scattered, throwing the objects in the chaos, and there were also many wounded who were not dead. Because the sound of the gun in the plane was roaring, they were struggling in the nearby forest to hide them, the fear and embarrassment was so difficult to describe. Then returned to the province through Hanyi Yiyang, along the way were very peaceful clouds. From this, it can be seen that the bandits are about to collapse toward the border of Hubei, (6th)</p>

<p>The Provincial Government Will be Reorganized After the Bandits are Cleared</p>
<p>Lu's Troops are Given a Deadline to Move to Western Fujian</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The Central Government has decided to clear the bandits in Fujian first, and then reorganize the government. However, it is rumored that Chen Jiliang and He Gonggan will be added to the Provincial Committee, and the rest will remain the same. The position of Director of Civil Affairs was previously held concurrently by Yang Shuzhuang, and Zheng Zhixin was appointed as a temporary measure. Now, because Zheng Baoqing has performed well in the previous battle, it is proposed to appoint Zheng as his successor. Chen Jiliang has recently received repeated telegrams from Yang urging him to go to Shanghai, and it is rumored that he will be appointed to act as chairman, allowing Yang to recuperate in Shanghai. As for who will be the secretary, it has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>In terms of military and political affairs, the primary issue is whether Lu's troops will comply with the order to move to western Fujian. Lu Xingbang telegraphed the province on the 5th, stating that his troops can set off after concentrating in Yangkou, and it is expected that all of them can leave Youyan by the 15th. Zhang Xinglong's troops have also moved towards Liancheng, etc. After receiving the telegram, the provincial government ordered Liu Heding's 56th Division to set off for Youyan on the 16th. Liu's troops have already set out. Regarding the Jian'ou Maritime and Land Team Headquarters, Chen Jiliang has ordered Lin Bingzhou of the Second Brigade to take over the defense immediately. Zhang Zhen's troops in southern Fujian have been reorganized into the 49th Division and, along with Liu's Division, are under the command of Zhu Shaoliang. Zhang also appointed Yang Fengnian as the commander of the anti-communist front, with the headquarters set up in Shizhong, and designated the 1345 regiments to set out from Zhangzhou to Nanjing within two weeks, first recovering Longyong, and then advancing to Hanglian. Zhu Shaoliang also ordered Li Zhengzhong and other officers to come to Fujian to await orders. As for the anti-communist rifles, bullets, mortars, and cannons, it is rumored that Chen Shaokuan has been authorized by the Naval Commander to receive them on behalf of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Headquarters, and they can be transported to Fujian for use by the Ding'an warship within a few days.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that Lu Xingbang's troops requested the provincial government to approve an extension of the deadline for troop deployment due to preparations for departure. The provincial government replied to Lu on the 6th, approving the extension of the deadline to the 15th of this month, and first remitted 10,000 yuan as departure expenses. On the 7th, the provincial government received Lu's reply, stating that he had complied with the order and all troops had been completely concentrated in Yanping, with the vanguard already open to the Yangkou of Shunchang County between Yanping and Jian'ou. Towns, are being promoted to the Fujian side, and can be completed within two weeks. Liu Heding, who took over Yanping, has now concentrated in Shuikou, and after supplementing the military fire, the road is starting to take off. The provincial government has completely resolved the Lu problem, and all the wartime established organs, except for the Provincial Government Military Commissioner's Office, which was completed ahead of schedule, and the Provincial Government Temporary Military Affairs Office and the East and West Road Bandit Suppression Headquarters will also be revoked uniformly within a few days. Zhang Ziming's vanguard team of the Anti-Lu force, originally reorganized by Chen Rongbiao brigade of Lu's troops, was also ordered to depart from Luoyuan County to the province, and the vanguard team's name was cancelled and reorganized by Liu's division, in order to clear the formalities. In addition, Lin Shouguo, the brigade commander of the Marine Corps Second Brigade, specially requested to resign after the end of the Anti-Lu military affairs. After being approved, he will go to Shanghai, and the vacancy will be filled by Lin Bingzhou, the commander of the third regiment of the brigade, who will be promoted by the Navy Department. After the province will open shipping with the upstream, the down-water cargo paper, tea, wood, bamboo shoots were delivered to the province, and prices have been trending downwards. The upstream goods, seafood, silk cloth, Su Guang medicine, have also been packed, and merchants are increasing.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Guangdong Province Prepares to Ban Gambling Next Year <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Requests the Central Government to Repay Public Bonds Issued by the Former Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The Department of Finance is currently preparing to ban gambling throughout the province next year in order to eliminate the long-standing gambling scourge that has plagued the people of Guangdong. It has been found that the annual gambling tax in Guangdong Province is about 10 million yuan, accounting for half of the province's annual revenue. Once this huge income is stopped, the province's budget will be severely affected. Therefore, the financial authorities are currently planning to reduce military spending, and at the same time, they are trying to investigate various tax revenues and collect special taxes to make up for the loss. On the other hand, there are still more than 20 million yuan of the first, second, and third-class public bonds issued by the former Ministry of Finance in Guangdong that have not been repaid. This money should be repaid by the Central Government. If the province implements a gambling ban next year, the provincial treasury will suffer a sudden loss and will have no surplus to repay this debt for the Ministry of Finance. Fan Caichang, Director of the Department of Finance, has already submitted this matter to the provincial government and forwarded it to the Central Government for verification. The original submission roughly stated that the Ministry of Finance is now setting up a committee to reorganize domestic and foreign debts, which will be established soon. Regarding the scope of the reorganization, it is stipulated that it is limited to the Central Government. The aforementioned public bonds were issued by the former Ministry of Finance in Guangdong, and the original plan for the financial public bonds issued in the 17th year was also for the purpose of coordinating the financial expenditure of various public bonds. It seems that it is different from the local situation of the province and should be included in the scope of the Central Government, and the entire committee should handle the cases together in order to clarify the central and local systems and clear the boundaries. It is reasonable to request your government to submit the case to the Executive Yuan and consult the Ministry of Finance, so that the Ministry can repay the debt and submit the case to the Committee for the Reorganization of Domestic and Foreign Debts to handle the cases together, etc. It is rumored that the motive for this matter stems from the fact that in September of this year, Chen Mingshu, chairman of the provincial government, proposed to the Central Political Conference that Guangdong Province plans to ban gambling this year, but the public bonds issued by the former Ministry of Finance in Guangdong have not been repaid to this day, with a principal of more than 20 million yuan, and it is proposed that the Central Government repay them, or replace the old bonds with new bonds to reduce the burden on Guangdong Province. The Central Political Conference decided to approve this and send it to Guangdong. Therefore, Director Fan Cai had this submission.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Guangzhou Permanently Stops Collecting Housing Rent <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Already Passed by the Guangdong Provincial Government Meeting</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the Guangdong Province began collecting housing rental surcharges, the excessive levies and disturbances have been unmatched. Several years ago, due to military relations, the government often collected three months' worth of rent out of the twelve months of the year.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Landlords, suffering this loss, raised the original rental values to compensate for the government's borrowing. As a result, this exploitation was passed on to the property-less tenants. Recently, Guangzhou's rents have continued to rise, creating a situation where it is difficult to live in Guangzhou. Moreover, this type of surcharge not only harmed ordinary people, but also greatly affected the police expenses of public security organs. Recently, Ouyang Ju, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, based on these reasons, specially proposed to permanently stop the collection of rental surcharges and submitted a request to the provincial government for approval. His memorial stated: "Since the Republic of China's twelfth year, whenever there has been a special need or a significant deficit in the treasury, rental surcharges have been levied in this city to swiftly collect large sums of money to cope with the situation. Once this precedent was set, it became a fixed practice. In recent years, due to frequent local disturbances, the supplies needed were enormous, and the case was cited for collection. Up to now, it has been done eighteen times, totaling more than thirteen million. This corner of the urban area has an increased burden of ten million, which is truly exhausting all resources and draining the pond to catch the fish. After the chaos, amidst the ashes, households lack savings. Although Guangzhou is prosperous, it seems to have returned to its former state, but mending the house requires pulling grass, and it is no longer what it used to be. Those who make a living by collecting rent rely on monthly rent for their daily needs. After paying the police surcharge, the remaining amount is barely enough. The suffering of repeatedly being taxed is well known. In recent years, citizens, fearing the collection of rental surcharges, have assumed two months of surcharges and two months of vacancy when calculating property income, budgeting for only eight months of rent per year. Comparing today's land prices and construction costs to the principal and interest, the interest rate is very low. Existing shops have no choice but to increase rent to offset the loss, causing potential investors to hesitate and renters to frown and complain. This has negatively impacted the city's construction and prosperous development. Moreover, citizens, out of concern for rental surcharges, often underreport rental amounts for police expenses, hoping to reduce the burden. Although there are penalties for false reporting and strict inspections, they resort to risky and侥倖 strategies due to repeated levies, leading to widespread underreporting. As a result, the regular income of the bureau is greatly reduced. Also, due to the collection of police surcharges, the workload of clerks and staff has doubled, leaving them with no time to handle the police fees that should be collected. Citizens, having already paid huge rental surcharges, are unable to pay the police fees again. Although the collection is strictly enforced, it has reached its limit, and the accumulation of arrears is a major reason. If this collection of rental surcharges has no end, not only will the people's lives become increasingly difficult, but the development of the urban area will also gradually decline, and the bureau's expenses will also gradually decrease. The public and private sectors are both in difficulty, and the relationship is significant. Citizens have repeatedly requested and pleaded for a permanent cessation of the collection. The bureau director believes that the government's collection of rental surcharges was originally a last resort, as raising other funds would be too slow to be effective, so it is better to collect nearby to meet local needs. Considering the citizens' enthusiasm for public welfare, it was a temporary measure of cutting flesh to heal wounds, and there is no reason to criticize it. Recently, the government has also been deeply concerned about rental surcharges before proceeding. The original intention was not to cause suffering to the people. For example, this time, to raise funds to suppress the rebellion, one month of financial borrowing was collected, stating that it was a temporary loan, which was to alleviate the people's hardships. It has now been repaid on schedule, which is different from previous rental surcharges. The citizens, admiring the government's kindness, all hope that the collection will be permanently stopped in the future to relieve the people's suffering. Collecting three or four times a year is no different from insatiable demands, and the burden all comes from the urban area, which seems unfair. As the director of the police administration, I am close to the citizens, silently observing the current economic situation of the city and the demands of public opinion. What I have seen and heard is verifiable and I dare not suppress it from above. I offer my humble opinions, not daring to seek praise. Whether to issue a clear order to permanently stop the collection of rental surcharges in the future to show sympathy and comply with public opinion should be submitted to the higher government for review and implementation." After receiving the submission, the provincial government proposed it at the 125th provincial affairs meeting on the 5th for discussion. It was immediately resolved to issue a proclamation as requested to permanently stop the collection and ordered the Department of Finance to comply. (December 6)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Han Fuqu Strictly Inspects His Troops <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After the end of the military affairs, the First Army Corps Commander Han Fuqu believed that the replenishment and training of his troops were basically in order and urgently needed strict inspection. It has now been decided to conduct inspections in groups and exchange inspections to monitor each other to avoid malpractices. They are divided into two groups, each with two chairmen to oversee the completion. Each group has six members, each responsible for specific inspection duties. Cao Fulin, the commander of the Fourteenth Army, will be in charge of Group A, inspecting Sun Tongxuan's Twelfth Army and the Pistol Brigade. Sun Tongxuan, the commander of the Twelfth Army, will be in charge of Group B, inspecting Cao Fulin's Fourteenth Army, the Twenty-second Division, and the Armored Vehicle Team. The members of each group have been appointed. It has been decided that starting at 7:30 am tomorrow (the 10th), the troops stationed in southern Jinan will be inspected first. After completion, they will separately go to the garrison locations of various troops outside the province to conduct inspections. Tomorrow, Cao Fulin's group will first inspect the Pistol Brigade, and Sun Tongxuan's group will first inspect the Twenty-second Division. (December 9)</p>

<p>Dushan Station on the Xuanwu Automobile Road Destroyed</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Bandits are rampant in southern Anhui, especially in Xuan Cheng, Lang Xi, and Guang De counties. Although troops are stationed there year-round to suppress them, they cannot be completely eliminated. Now, Yue Shengxuan, the commander of the Fifty-seventh Division, has specially transferred the entire regiment of Yu Fengrun, the One Hundred and Seventy-first Brigade, to be stationed in Guang Lang and other places. The bandits then fled to Xuan Cheng. At 7:00 pm on the 9th, several hundred bandits were entrenched in the village of Lijia, more than thirty miles west of Xuan Cheng. They sent dozens of bandits to Dushan Town nearby, destroying the Dushan station on the Xuanwu long-distance automobile road, abducting the stationmaster Dai Jinchun and a worker, cutting off the long-distance telephone poles with axes, and setting fire to the wooden bridges of the thirteenth and fourteenth automobile roads. Another group surrounded and attacked the People's Self-Defense Corps of the Fourteenth Detachment in Tuanshan Town, confiscating seven rifles. Today, the Xuanwu long-distance automobile can only reach Wanzhi Town. In addition to mobilizing a large number of self-defense corps to encircle and suppress the bandits, the Xuancheng County Government has telegraphed the military officers to send troops to suppress them.

<h3 id="e67">Large Band of Fierce Bandits Discovered in Western Shenyang <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Shenyang County and Xinmin County are adjacent. On the night of the 3rd of this month, a large band of mounted bandits suddenly emerged from Xinmin to Panggutai in the seventh district of western Shenyang. There were about a hundred or more bandits, each equipped with a large rifle and a pistol. Among them, some even carried two pistols. The bandits had ample ammunition for both large and small guns, their horsemanship was extremely skilled, and they brought their own food. After staying for about a day, they left the area without robbing or kidnapping. It was said that their intention was solely to collect food. The local public security sub-bureau, aware of the situation, notified the general bureau by telephone because the bandits were numerous and the police were few. Zhang Detang, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, immediately led a team to rush there. By the time they reached the area, the bandits had already left. To demonstrate their strength and deter the bandits, the police team conducted artillery drills outside the village, the sound of which resonated far and wide. Seeing no trace of the bandits, they returned in formation. Unexpectedly, the bandits, after leaving the area, learned that the police team had led a group to pursue them and had conducted artillery drills to demonstrate their strength. They then returned to confront the police team and vowed to fight to the death. They also told the villagers that they had not intended to harm the villagers of the Shenyang area, but the revenge for the police team's pursuit had to be taken. They said that their departure earlier was voluntary and not because they were frightened away by the police team. After the bandits returned, they looted everywhere and kidnapped many wealthy people in the area, stationing themselves in Panggutai Village. Upon hearing the alarm, the local public security sub-bureau sent a team to engage the bandits once. Unexpectedly, the bandits were extremely fierce, and several police officers were killed in action. The sub-bureau urgently reported to the general bureau, and Director Zhang Detang again led a team to the village at night to confront the bandits. From the afternoon of the 4th to the morning of the 5th, gunshots rang out intermittently in the darkness and snow. By sunrise, most of the county's artillery and public security teams had gathered in the village, preparing to launch a general attack on the bandits. The bandits then gradually moved north, and the police team did not dare to pursue them closely, but took a gradual encirclement approach. At the same time, the Fourth and Fifth Companies of the Public Security Infantry were also mobilized to converge on the area to participate in the suppression. A team was sent to the province to request a large batch of guns and ammunition for resupply. It is said that this band of bandits is extremely barbaric and may not be eliminated within a day or two. It is also said that the bandits were originally from the military and had experienced many battles. Their current desperate act poses a significant hidden danger to the area. (December 6)</p>
<h3 id="e68">A Glimpse of the Rampancy of Korean Communists in Yanbian <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Eighty-One Cases Occurred This Year</p>
<p>Zhang Shuhan Goes to the Province to Discuss Communist Suppression Policies</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: Korean Communists in Yanbian are secretly multiplying, as numerous as crucian carp crossing the river, dedicated to burning, killing, and destruction. The people on the border suffer immeasurably from them. After the Japanese police withdrew last month, the Yanbian Federation of Agriculture, Industry, Commerce, and Students, citing the weakness of the Chinese police force, appealed to both Liaoning and Jilin to increase police to prevent communism. The authorities have not yet decided on a plan, and the Communist bandits are becoming increasingly rampant. From this spring to the present, the Office of the Supervisor of Administrative Affairs of Yanji and Wangqing Counties has received reports from various counties, totaling eighty-one cases, with as many as forty-four people killed by burning and murder, not including those injured. The loss of property is even more difficult to estimate. In addition, there are unknown numbers of cases that were not reported due to the police and local militias avoiding responsibility. The office has now presented the facts and submitted a list, with seventeen cases in Helong, four cases in Wangqing, and the rest occurring in various districts of Yanji. The Communist parties involved in the incidents ranged from two or three hundred people to dozens or three or five people. Some even dared to act recklessly alone. Among the more serious incidents, on January 7, more than a hundred Communist bandits were discovered in Yanji River, intending to burn and kill in Yanji County. Fifty-four people were captured by Chinese and Japanese military and police. On the same day, the family of Jin Zhengshun, a settler in Daomugou Longlin Village, Yanji County, was killed by four Communists and three were injured. On May 3, more than two hundred Communist bandits attacked Toudaogou City and burned down the Korean People's Association. On August 29, more than a hundred Communist bandits were discovered in Dadonggou, Yanji, burning and killing seven villagers. On May 20, the Communist Party destroyed the Daxing Electric Light Company in Jian Village, causing significant damage. In early August, more than three hundred Communist bandits attempted to destroy the defense post of the Yanji Dafangzi local militia and forcibly seize weapons. They were later repelled by the militia. In Wangqing County, seventy Communist bandits killed two militiamen in Shitougouzi, Tedanchuan. In Dahuanggou, fifty Communist bandits killed four militiamen. On September 21, the Xiaoliudaogou Public Security Outpost in the first district of Helong was attacked by Communist bandits, injuring two people. On May 31, the Japanese Ordinary School in Huaiqing Street, the fifth district of Helong, was burned down by more than twenty Korean Communists, and a railway bridge was also burned. On September 11, more than a hundred Korean Communists were discovered in the same area north of the street, roaring forward. Fortunately, the police were prepared and they did not succeed in their attack. On November 20, more than seventy Communist bandits burned and killed seven members of the Jin Guangsan family in Dadonggou, Helong. On November 18, Li Houye, the principal of the No. 29 County School in Yanji Liushuhezi, and five others were burned and killed by Communist bandits. Other schools and households that were burned are too numerous to list. Zhang Shuhan, the head of the Yanji Municipal Government and the Supervisor of Administrative Affairs of the four counties, specially came to the province at the end of last month to report on the situation of the Communist disaster in Yanbian. The heads of the Yanji City and County Public Security Bureaus also came to the province one after another to discuss everything. Zhang will soon go to Liaoning to meet with Zhang Zuoxiang to ask for instructions. It is said that the Communist disaster in Yanbian is rampant and the crisis is imminent. If it is not suppressed as soon as possible, there will be difficult to deal with. This trip will discuss a concrete plan with the authorities to work hard to eliminate communism and prevent the Japanese from making excuses and to reassure the people. (December 3)</p>

<p>Zhang Jingjiang, the chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, resigned from the central government and went to Tiantai Mountain with Zhang Ji. He returned to the province a few days ago and continues to preside over the affairs of the provincial government as usual. It is said that he has always been enthusiastic about promoting the construction of Zhejiang Province and regarded the provincial government's regular meeting on the 12th as his last meeting in office. He personally attended the meeting and participated in the discussions that morning. At 6:00 pm, Zhang left Hangzhou on the ninth express train for Shanghai on the same evening, as someone was responsible for Zhejiang's political affairs and he urgently needed to leave Hangzhou. Upon hearing the news, people from all walks of life gathered at the station to see him off. Those who arrived included the heads of various organs affiliated to the provincial government, Zhu Mingtao, the director of the Security Office, Hang Yi, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Wang Zuyao from the business community, among others, totaling more than a hundred people.

<h3 id="e70">Jiangsu Province Plans to Dredge the Shallow Sections of the Li Canal <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The Canal Works Office Has Two Proposed Plans</p>
<p>The Jiangbei Li Canal in Jiangsu Province, from Gaoyou to Jieshou, is the most shallow and narrow section and is prone to siltation. Every winter, when the canal water is low, the inflow from the Ziying Sluice into the lower canal is excessively strong, and the inflow of lake water into the canal from the Jiusheng Port increases, causing the section north of Mapeng Bay to often reverse flow. In the 11th and 12th years of the Republic of China (1922-1923), the former Transport Supervision Bureau used manual dredging once. Later, at the request of the Baoying people to rebuild the sluice gates to facilitate farmland irrigation, Yong'an Sluice, Zhangcheng Hole, etc., were dismantled and rebuilt, and the Jinmen was lowered and enlarged, reducing the amount of water. During periods of low water, the canal flow in this section became weaker, causing the previously dredged areas to become silted again within a few years. The storage capacity was reduced, and traffic and irrigation became difficult. In recent years, drought has been a disaster, and the people along the canal have repeatedly requested dredging. The former Canal Engineering Bureau planned to first dredge the Zhangfu Water Diversion Field to increase the upper stream water source of the canal, and then seek to regulate the ports on the west bank of the Li Canal bed to equalize the flow and reduce siltation. However, the Zhangfu River project was ordered by the Construction Committee to be included in the Huai River Diversion project and handled jointly, so it was not carried out. The former Canal Engineering Office revised its plan to first use manual dredging to dredge the shallow sections of the Li Canal near Gaobao, starting from Yangjiamiao in Huaian to Yuehe Port in Gaoyou, with all the projects being carried out simultaneously. Then, a new sluice gate would be built on the west bank of the Sishui flood section to divert water from the lake to help the canal, while deepening the Tonghu Sluice Hole diversion canal and changing the Jiusheng Port entrance to ensure that the two waters of the river and canal would flow smoothly after meeting. However, due to the large project and huge funds, it was not easy to raise funds. In addition, the original savings from the canal management land tax and other miscellaneous taxes were insufficient to cover the expenses. Therefore, the project was changed to annual and sectional dredging, first selecting the silted sections for construction and dredging, in order to improve them gradually. The former Canal Engineering Office prepared a plan to divide the dredging into four sections step by step, and the third section, which was the most silted and narrowest, from Zhangcheng Hole in Sishui to Jiusheng Port in Mapeng, with a length of twenty-five kilometers, was selected for the first dredging. All the construction surveys, engineering plans, budget charts, etc., for this section have been completed and submitted to the Water Conservancy Bureau. According to the plan, there are two options for consideration and implementation based on financial resources. The first option is to excavate the river bottom to a width of twelve meters, with a slope of two on both sides, removing more than 155,000 cubic meters of earth. The estimated cost, including the construction of dams and water pumps, is about 152,000 silver dollars. The second option is to excavate the river bottom to a width of nine meters, with a slope of two on both sides, removing more than 109,000 cubic meters of earth. The estimated cost, including the construction of dams and water pumps, is about 108,000 silver dollars. The above two options were proposed by the former Canal Engineering Office to the Council of Advisers and were approved. The second option was adopted because it was easier to implement. It is now heard that the Water Conservancy Bureau has submitted it to the Construction Department for approval and is preparing everything. The necessary funds are also being actively planned for, aiming to start construction in the winter when the water recedes and the farmers are free, and to complete all the work before the rice planting season in the spring. During the construction period, the shipping traffic in this section will be handled as usual, with the Shipping Association notifying the boat owners and small steamers to divert from the Baoying North Sluice diversion canal and the Mapeng Bay Jiusheng Port, passing through the lake and detouring.</p>

<p>Further News of the Robbery in Tong'an Bridge Town. Regarding the incident in Hufang Township, Tong'an Bridge Town, where a large gang of lake bandits robbed the town around 4 PM on the 10th of this month, and kidnapped ten hostages, including Zhu Zuozhou, it was learned yesterday that after the lake bandits kidnapped the ten hostages that evening, they fled through Nanhejia Bridge, Longtang Bridge, Chenwuzhuang Bridge, and exited Taihu Lake to Xiaogong Mountain. At that time, Zhu Zuozhou, a business corps instructor who was injured during the kidnapping, died on the bandit ship due to his injuries. The bandits, considering it inauspicious, abandoned the body on the beach. The bandit ship arrived at Jinshu Port, where they interrogated the kidnapped hostages one by one regarding their family wealth. As a result, they first released Wang Jianzhong, the principal of Tong'an Elementary School, Lu Shuxun, the executive committee member of the Third District Second Branch, Chai Bingsheng, a cook from the派出所 police station, and Chen Qiao, a Jiangbei boatman. They also released a boat, which Chen Qiao sailed back to the town. The remaining hostages, Li Qianqing, the business corps minister, and merchants Jin Peizhi, Zhou Shuiquan (yesterday's report erroneously stated he was released), Zhu Shaoyu, Zhang Shunbao, and Wang Shengqiu, were not released and were taken by the bandits to the western Taihu Lake. Regarding the total losses in the town, a preliminary investigation was conducted yesterday. Fangtailong Nanhua Store estimated a loss of approximately 691.9 yuan, 321 small silver dollars, 30 角輔幣券 supplementary currency coupons, and 10,000 copper coins.

<p>Five Bandits Involved in the Tong'an Bridge Robbery Captured. The Third District Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau apprehended Yang Yuanliang, Chen Alu, Lu Aliuliu, Huang Mingrong, Lu Shi, and five other suspects involved in the Tong'an Bridge robbery at the Tianyuan Inn in Le Rong Fang outside Lümen Gate on the night before last (the 11th) at midnight, along with 90 yuan in suspected stolen silver dollars. They have been taken to the bureau for interrogation. Meanwhile, police have been dispatched to various locations to rigorously search for the remaining accomplices.</p>
<p>Major Theft from Pan Yi Zhuang. A large sum of money was stolen from Pan Songlin Yi Zhuang in Xuanqiao Lane inside Loumen Gate. The Zhuang had several thousand acres of Zhuang farmland. Pan Zhimao served as the Zhuang head. Every time the rent was collected, five or six people, including Fang Bohua, were hired to collect the rent rice. All the cash converted from the collected rice was deposited in the bank daily. However, there was always over a thousand yuan in cash kept in the Zhuang. The night before last (the 11th), thieves somehow broke into the Zhuang and went to the inner Zhuang room, where they opened the silver box and stole over a thousand silver dollars before escaping through the back door.

<p>Several Robberies in One Week. Chen Shengcai, a fisherman from the vicinity of Dianshan River in the northeast of the Sixth District of the county, was repeatedly robbed by two bandit boats with over ten bandits on board one night last month, losing dozens of catties of crabs worth over 50 silver dollars. Three days later, in Xiyu Township, around 9 PM, four bandit boats with over thirty bandits suddenly arrived. Farmers fled at the alarm, allowing the bandits to search and rob house by house without hindrance. It is reported that over 600 yuan was stolen in total.</p>
<p>Township Head Arrested on Suspicion of Private Smuggling. Cheng, the township head of Shangshu Town in the Sixth District of the county, opened both a Nanhua and a meat shop in the town and has always been law-abiding. Suddenly, several police officers from the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau were dispatched to Cheng's residence and shops to search them, claiming to be acting on a secret order from the county government, accusing Cheng of private smuggling of opium. However, after two hours of searching, nothing was found. Cheng was then taken to the bureau and sent to the county for investigation. People in the town, believing Cheng to be honest and law-abiding, feel unjustly treated and have jointly submitted a petition to the county government for his release.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Province Pawn Industry to Hold Regular Meeting. The Jiangsu Province Pawn Industry Regulations have recently been revised by the ministry and province and are scheduled to be implemented on January 1, 20 of the Republic of China. After the promulgation, the pawn industry associations of Tai, Dongtai, and Xinghua counties took the lead in pointing out that Article 16 of the newly revised regulations states, "For over five days in a month, half a month's interest is charged; for over fifteen days, one month's interest is charged." The old regulations originally stipulated that the pawn redemption month should not exceed five days. If the sixth day was exceeded, one month's interest would be charged. Now the pawn industry is extremely depressed, expenses are increasing daily, and income is declining. If the interest is reduced by half a month, pawnshops will not be able to cover their losses and will face difficulties. They jointly sent a letter to the Provincial Pawn Industry Association, requesting assistance to maintain operations. Subsequently, pawnshops in various counties responded and appealed en masse, stating that in recent years, financial resources have been exhausted and the pawn industry has plummeted. Statistics from Jiangsu Province show that nearly a hundred pawnshops have closed. This is clear evidence. Although the government has set restrictions, pawnshops seek profits to cover costs and cannot afford to lose money. It is difficult to force them. The country does not yet have public pawnshops. If pawnshops in various counties cannot survive, it will cause many poor people to lose their livelihoods, which is contrary to the government's intention to help the poor. Moreover, pawnshops in京 Shanghai and provincial capitals are not subject to the half-month interest reduction, which is particularly unfair. Therefore, over 190 pawnshops, including the pawn industry associations and offices of Tai County, Dongtai County, Xinghua County, Wujiang County, Kunshan County, Songjiang County, Dantu County, Wujin County, Yixing County, Changshu County, Liyang County, Jiangyin County, Wuxian County, and Wuxi County, have exchanged correspondence, discussing ways to cope with the situation. They decided to hold a meeting at the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce at 2 PM on the 22nd of this month, inviting colleagues from various counties to jointly discuss rescue measures. Yesterday, they sent a notice to the pawn industry associations of various counties throughout the province, requesting them to send responsible representatives with credentials to Wuxi on time to discuss and formulate a plan.</p>
<p>Requesting a Flexible Account Settlement Method via Telegram. The Wuxi Chamber of Commerce has already notified all industries to comply with the national calendar for year-end account settlement and has published a notice to that effect. However, recently, it has repeatedly received letters from chambers of commerce in various counties that have dealings with Wuxi, as well as from various industries in Wuxi, stating that as winter arrives and autumn grains are harvested, various industries are in dire need of funds, and the market relies on this turnover. However, with the year-end account settlement, Shanghai is urging the closure of accounts, causing silver prices to tighten daily and the market to become depressed. Not only is commerce affected, but low grain prices harm farmers.</p>
<p>Moreover, the county government is busy collecting grain taxes, receiving only thirty or forty gold pieces daily, a historically low amount. If no measures are taken to provide relief, it will inevitably affect the winter grain tax collection, leading to official-civilian hardship and an unmanageable market. They have requested that the Chamber of Commerce forward their requests to the government to continue using the Jiangsu Province grain tax collection method, extending the settlement date to February 16 of the following year to rescue the market and avoid panic. The Chamber of Commerce has immediately telegraphed the National Government Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting approval for a flexible approach to provide relief. It is unknown how the government will respond.</p>
<p>Another Bandit Involved in the Kidnapping Case Captured. Qian Tianxiong, the captain of the county police brigade's water patrol team, recently led detectives in the vicinity of Fu'an Township, Hudai Town, and captured three key suspects in the case of Feng Yunsheng, the youngest son of Yuequan, the deputy head of Shuiqiao Township, Xiaofeng Lane, Kaiyuan Township, who was kidnapped and robbed. They were sent to the brigade headquarters for interrogation. The day before yesterday afternoon, Captain Wang opened a court and interrogated them severely. One of them, Ding Asheng, 22 years old, confessed to kidnapping Feng Yuequan and demanding a huge ransom. He also revealed that there was an accomplice hiding in Outangqiao, Kaiyuan Township. Another, Zhu Shilin, and a third, Xu Baorong, both confessed that on June 4 of this year, they committed a robbery at Zhijing Nunnery in Qingshan Bay, and also shot Wang Yunyun. After Captain Wang obtained their confessions, he prepared a document yesterday and sent it to the county government for legal interrogation. Regarding the accomplice revealed by Ding Asheng, it is reported that Wang has ordered Detective Liao to cooperate with detectives to go to the countryside to arrest him, and he has already been captured.</p>

<p>New and Old Accountants of the Finance Bureau Hand Over. Since Hao Bingzhang was transferred to任任 take over as the director of the Finance Bureau of this county, there was still a portion that had not been fully transferred from the previous director, Fei Yuhong. It was decided to hold an accounting meeting at the Finance Bureau on the afternoon of the 10th of this month. Former Director Fei sent Wu Xingwu and Gui Mengjian to Changshu in advance to represent him in the handover. On that day, Director Hao convened representatives from various party and government agencies to attend. The liquidation began at 2 PM, and the results were found to be in compliance with the listed register. However, it was noted that under the original register item, various special funds that should have been deposited with the Education Bureau, the Construction Bureau, and the District Office had all been misappropriated. Gao Tinggui, the director of the Education Bureau, denied this and requested that the funds be reclaimed, while Representative Gui stated that the funds had been used for local purposes and there were receipts for all of them. Lin Mengdan, the chief of the Finance Bureau's General Affairs Section, stated that it would not be appropriate for the new director to immediately allocate the funds. As a result, it was agreed by both parties that the 前述 a mentioned funds of over 9,000 yuan would be borrowed by former Director Fei in consultation with the new director, and that the interest would be borne by former Director Fei from the date of the loan until the date when the new director collected the tax revenues. Furthermore, Gao, Director of Education Bureau, raised the issue that the Education Bureau had not received the 6,000 yuan in surplus gun tax revenue listed in the local budget for the 18th year of the Republic of China, of which half was earmarked for education funding. Representative Gui stated that the autumn inspection last year had resulted in a reduced quality, and there was no surplus in the tax revenue collection. In the end, Deng Bingwei of the Party Department offered a conciliatory opinion that the Education Bureau's share of the tax revenue collection surplus would be subject to a further accounting after Fei, the former director, submitted a report on the income and expenditures for that item. Only then were both parties satisfied. Therefore, the handover procedure between Fei and Hao still needs to be continued.</p>
<p>A Firewood Boat Was Robbed in Yangcheng Lake. Qian Genfa, a resident of Dongtang City Township in this county, around 40 years old, who specialized in selling rice straw, loaded a boat with rice straw and three companions the day before yesterday and sailed to Shanghai to sell it. After mooring for two days, the straw was completely sold, yielding over 50 silver dollars. They immediately raised anchor to return to Changshu. To their surprise, while sailing in Yangcheng Lake at around 11 PM, two small boats suddenly sped out of the reeds and approached their boat. Suddenly, over ten bandits wielding sharp blades and wooden sticks jumped onto Qian's boat, ordering them to stop. They first bound Qian Genfa and his boat companions with麻 hemp rope and placed them in the stern cabin. Then, they rampaged through the boat, searching and robbing. As a result, they robbed over 50 silver dollars from the sale, as well as two bolts of factory cloth and one umbrella that fellow villagers had entrusted Qian to purchase. Before leaving, they also injured Qian with a stick.</p>
<p>The County Government Re-examines the Strange Youth. A strange youth was discovered in the vicinity of Haitang Sanlidao outside Dadongmen in this county last month. He panicked and said that bandit troops were retreating from Kunshan and were passing through Changshu to cross the river, and he called for shops to close and stopped pedestrians from passing. Zhou Zhongshan, a merchant, reported the incident to the Dong District Business Corps, who detained the youth and sent him to the Public Security Bureau, which in turn sent him to the county judiciary for interrogation. Yesterday (the 10th) afternoon, the county government specially summoned witnesses Zhou Zhongshan and Jin Shengding, as well as Wu Kunyuan, a member of the Business Corps, and the defendant Zhou Bingxing, among others. Shen, the审员 judicial officer, opened a court for re-examination. According to Zhou Bingxing's testimony, "That night, I was drunk and confused for a moment. I was fooled by Feng Alin. I came to know Feng because I delivered soup to him. That day, Feng said to me, 'I'll ask you to do something, and it will only take two hours, and I'll give you two silver dollars.' Because I wanted silver dollars, I agreed to do it. Now I don't know where Feng is. In short, I was fooled by someone and I ask for forgiveness." Subsequently, because further investigation was still needed, the county government ordered Zhou Bingxing to be remanded in custody.</p>

Recently, because there is no solution to the education funds problem, and those who are in arrears are even humiliated by blocking the road and grabbing at him, there is talk of resigning again.</p>
<p>The Party Department Opens a Public School. The Committee for the Rectification of County Districts of the Yangzhong Party Branch opened a Public School because illiteracy accounts for about 95% in Yangzhong, so it strongly advocates literacy education. It has now been decided to open a Public School in Sanmaozhen. The method is to divide it into two classes, ordinary and adult, each recruiting 50 people, and teaching them Party doctrine, general knowledge, Mandarin, and arithmetic. The expenses are entirely borne by the Committee for the Rectification of County Districts.</p>

<p>Witnesses in the Water Police Roadside Robbery Case Have Been Sent to Court. Li Languan, a farmer from Wangdian, Jiaxing, was previously stopped by Jiang Yizhi and others of the stationed water police outside Wangdian Station in Yangqi, and Li's throat was bound with a scarf with the intention of robbery. Later, someone bumped into them, and Li escaped without loss. After the incident, Li named Jiang in a complaint to the court. The court sent a letter to the Second District Water Police Headquarters requesting that Jiang and others be sent to the case for investigation. It is now learned that Yao Guangying, the squad leader of the Sixth Squad of the Wangdian Water Police, patrol chief Jiang Yizhi, water policeman Qi Biao, and three witnesses were sent to the Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution yesterday. However, according to reliable sources, the witnesses in the case are unwilling to testify truthfully. As a result, the outcome of this case is feared to be insignificant.</p>
<p>The County Public Security Bureau Director Takes Over. Shen Weishu, the director of the Jiaxing County Public Security Bureau, was ordered to be dismissed due to a case. Qiu Zeshen, the director of the Second Branch Bureau, was temporarily appointed to concurrently serve as director. After Shen immediately handed over the work and left his post, the province appointed Gao Derun, the director of the Haining County Public Security Bureau, to fill the vacancy. Gao Derun has now completed the handover of Haining's bureau affairs and came to He yesterday to take over.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Opposition to Water Rate Increase <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Resolves on Countermeasures</p>
<p>Real Estate Association to Convene Meeting Today</p>
<p>The Public Concession's water rate increase case, ever since the company adopted high-pressure tactics by cutting off water to Zhang Tiankai, a resident of Connaught Road, and the Hua Shang villas on Peng Road, has aroused serious public attention. The Taxpayers' Association is also actively engaged in negotiations. The details heard yesterday are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association convened a meeting of its Standing Committee at noon yesterday. Present were Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Vice Chairman Xu Jilong, Standing Committee members Lu Feibohong and Hu Fengxiang, Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Xinliu, and Liu Hongsheng, Chinese Committee members Qian Longzhang and Wu Yunzhai, and Secretaries Yan Esheng, Tao Leqin, and He Haikui. First, the secretaries reported on the water cut-off situation in various areas. Next, Yu Qiaqing reported. After detailed discussion by all attendees, it was unanimously agreed that the matter concerned the life and safety of residents of the Public Concession and should be handled with utmost seriousness. All countermeasures decided upon were assigned to the attendees for their respective responsibilities. Details will not be disclosed for the time being. The important points are: (1) the Public Works Department should be requested to adopt public opinion and revise the contract; (2) the water company must restore water supply and must not engage in such oppressive actions again in the future.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association, upon receiving reports of the water company's water cut-off, immediately held a meeting of responsible personnel and decided not to succumb to such high-pressure tactics. It was decided to convene an emergency meeting today (the 13th) at 4 p.m. to discuss countermeasures, and telegrams were sent out for appeal. The telegrams are recorded separately below: (To the British Government) To the British Consul-General in Shanghai, the British Minister in Peiping, and the British Cabinet and Parliament in London: The Shanghai Waterworks Company, a British enterprise, coerced residents to increase water rates and cut off water supply yesterday, engaging in a throat-grabbing blackmail. The lives of millions of residents are in imminent danger. Public sentiment is indignant, and the situation is serious. We specially request that you immediately order the restoration of the original state and the continued water supply to uphold humanitarianism and maintain Sino-British amity. Shanghai Real Estate Association, December 12. (Submitted to Government Authorities) To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Shanghai Municipal Government in Nanjing: The British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company, failing to coerce a rate increase, cut off water supply yesterday, endangering the lives of millions of residents. We urgently telegraph to request intervention to restore water supply. Awaiting your orders. Shanghai Real Estate Association bows. (Notice to All Members) Sirs: Because the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company has failed to increase rates and disregarded the survival rights of residents, the specific principles of public utilities, and the provisions of criminal law, it cut off water supply the day before yesterday. The lives and property of millions of residents are endangered. We have specifically decided to convene an emergency meeting at 4 p.m. on December 13 (Saturday). We hereby write to request your attendance at that time. If you send a representative, please grant them full authority.</p>
<p>The Attitude of the Public Works Department: Yesterday, our reporter interviewed Mr. Jones of the Public Works Department regarding the water rate increase issue. According to his reply, in October, due to the high price of gold and low price of silver, the Board of Directors had no choice but to approve the water company's rate increase. At that time, there were five Chinese directors as their representatives participating in the meeting. When the Public Works Department discussed the case, it also took into account the interests of all citizens and conducted a very precise and detailed study. There are two standards for water charges: one is calculated according to the water meter, and the other is calculated according to the house rent. Currently, the Shanghai Waterworks Company calculates according to house rent. This system is beneficial to residents of the middle and lower classes and unfavorable to the upper class. Because if the amount of water used is the same, the upper-class residents pay more, and the middle and lower-class residents pay less. For example, if we take three classes of residents, upper, middle, and lower, each with a family of five, each person uses 33 gallons of water per month, and the whole family uses 165 gallons. Assuming a charge of 6% of the house rent, those with a house rent of 10 yuan pay 6 jiao per month, those with a house rent of 50 yuan pay 3 yuan per month, those with a house rent of 100 taels pay 6 taels per month, and those with a house rent of 200 taels pay 12 taels per month. Using the same amount of water, one pays 12 taels and the other pays 6 jiao. The water fees paid by upper-class residents exceed the cost of water, while the water fees paid by middle and lower-class residents are less. In order to take care of the interests of the majority of people and the water company, the Public Works Department had to take from the rich to make up for the poor. If calculated by water meter, the water fees paid by upper, middle, and lower-class citizens would be equal. The result would be an average increase of 20% in water fees, which would increase the burden on middle and lower-class citizens even more. The water company is very happy to convert the city to water meters. However, it would cost two to three million yuan and take two to three years to complete. Furthermore, according to Mr. Pearson, the General Engineer and Manager of the Waterworks Company, the company plans to convene a shareholders' meeting to discuss the issue of changing to water meters. The Public Works Department has also agreed in principle, believing this is the only way to open the current difficulty and the only way to restrain citizens' water use. As for the company having cut off water supply, it is only to two families because they owe three months of water fees. There are also many families who have paid the increased rates. This statement is somewhat biased towards the company's side. However, in order to study the truth of the matter, we must collect the opinions of all parties and make a fair judgment. Therefore, we present them together.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Condition Improving Daily <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>

<p>Regarding the crash of the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai aircraft, the funeral for Xiong Shihui's severely injured and deceased bodyguard, Zeng Chunfan, was held yesterday morning, and the coffin was temporarily placed in the Zheshao Guild Hall.

When he woke up on the morning of the 12th, his spirit was better than yesterday. He wanted to read newspapers, but Dr. Niu Huisheng stopped him, fearing it would affect his spirit. Dr. Niu, along with doctors Zeng Baohan and Chen Jiayu, changed the dressing on the wound. There was no change in the wound. He urinated spontaneously twice. Dr. Niu instructed him to eat chicken broth, thin porridge, and orange juice. The temperature was 99 degrees Fahrenheit at 9:00 a.m., pulse 100, respiration 20.

Dr. Bode examined him once yesterday morning and scheduled an X-ray examination of the internal injuries today. Closer relatives have been allowed to visit him in the ward. When Mayor Zhang visited, he also went inside to express his condolences, spoke a few words, and left. According to reports, Yang's complexion was very good, but his voice was very low. Yesterday, Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhengting, Liu Wendao, Tao Luqian, Ma Chaojun, and others all sent telegrams of condolences.</p>
<p>Consular Corps Sends Condolences: Yesterday, telegrams from various parties to the Garrison Headquarters to express condolences to Commander Xiong included Ye Chucang, Wang Jun, Liu Wendao, Huang Bingheng, Zhang Zhizhong, Jiang Ji, Zhong Zupei, Ma Chaojun, and Zhang Zhen.

The consular corps leader believes that after Commander Xiong recovers, you will be able to personally tell Commander Xiong of the consular corps leader and others' concerns. Sincerely wishing you well every day, Belgian Consul-General and Consular Corps Leader Wang Qi. (5) Letter from the Finnish Chargé d'Affaires, I hereby inform you that I recently learned that you were injured in a plane crash yesterday, and I was shocked to hear about it. I hope you take care of yourself and recover soon. Sincerely sending this letter to express condolences and wish you a speedy recovery, Wei Meiji, December 12.</p>
<p>The Glory of the Bodyguard: Xiong's bodyguard Zeng Chunfan was shrouded in mourning at 8 a.m. yesterday at the International Funeral Parlor. All officers of the Garrison Headquarters went to pay their respects. Mrs. Zeng beat her chest and wept, fainting repeatedly, and was rescued and comforted by the people from the Garrison Department. At 9:30 a.m. yesterday morning, the coffin was moved to No. 17 of the Zheshao Guild Hall. The mourners included Commander Xiong's brother Xiong Maohui,</p>
<p>Aide-de-Camp Jiang Yi, and more than 50 other officers. The Garrison Department sent a platoon of soldiers and the Headquarters military band to escort the funeral. The Garrison Department telegraphed the National Government to request compensation. The officers of the Garrison Department were deeply saddened by Zeng's tragic death and sympathized with his poor family and orphaned children, so they all enthusiastically donated money to help the widow and orphans in the future. According to Aide-de-Camp Jiang, who spoke to the Hua Dong News Agency reporter, more than 3,000 yuan has already been donated.</p>
<p>Handling of the Aftermath: Regarding the handling of the aftermath of the case, according to news from Beijing yesterday, China National Aviation Corporation Chairman Wang Boqun is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today to investigate the truth of the accident to clarify responsibility and to convene a board meeting to discuss the compensation for the pilot. As for the ticket price of passengers such as Commander Xiong, the company has decided to refund the full amount.</p>
<p>Also, the body of the Russian woman, Andeffe, has been taken care of by company director Hamilton. Yesterday, a Russian friend of Andeffe, Smorodinsky, who lives at 364 Avenue Joffre, went to the company to collect it. According to news from the Hua Dong News Agency, regarding the compensation for the victims of the accident, because the company's regulations stipulate that the company is not responsible for passengers and luggage, it is difficult to expect compensation to become a reality.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Federation Held a Public Banquet Last Night</p>
<h3 id="e120">Preparing to Build a Memorial Stele for Chen Minqing <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation held a reception at the East Asia Restaurant last night because Chen Minqing, chairman of the Nanyang Penang Guanghua Daily, Reading Newspaper Agency, Zhenling Zhonghua, and Singapore Xin Guomin Daily, returned to China to discuss overseas Chinese affairs in Nanyang and prepare to build a memorial stele for martyr Chen Xinzheng. The Overseas Chinese Federation was established in the first year of the Republic of China by revolutionary overseas Chinese Chen Xinzheng, Wu Shirong, and others in accordance with the intentions of the Premier. This time, Chen Xinzheng's younger brother, Chen Minqing, negotiated in Beijing, and the central government commemorated Chen Xinzheng's revolutionary achievements and instructed the Fujian Provincial Party Department to cooperate with the government to build a Chen Xinzheng memorial stele in Xiamen Zhongshan Park. Chen Minqing, as a family member, is going to Xiamen today to assist. The Overseas Chinese Federation specially invited people from all walks of life to the banquet. Chairman Xu Jigong and Lin Youren first gave welcome speeches, followed by speeches from the guests. Finally, the Overseas Chinese Federation distributed the biography of Chen Xinzheng as follows:</p>
<p>Martyr Chen, named Wentu, zi (style name) Xinzheng, was a native of Siming Heshan in Fujian. He loved learning and had great aspirations and was valued by many in his hometown. At the age of nineteen, he followed his father Chen Yuhe to Nanyang to Penang to assist in the shipping business and also ran a business called Baocheng. In a few years, he started his business by transporting local products. The martyr did not confine himself to business. At that time, the Qing government was weak and the national situation was precarious. The Premier advocated revolution overseas and came to Nanyang from Tokyo. The martyr heard of it and jumped up and first welcomed him with overseas Chinese comrades Huang Quanguang, Wu Shirong, Qiu Mingyong, etc. Then there was the establishment of the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance). The martyr was young, shrewd, capable, and thoughtful in planning things. He was elected as a leader in the alliance. At the time of the initial defeat in Huizhou Qinlian, the leaders were all angry and advocated rapid advancement. The martyr gathered comrades and first raised thousands of gold to support the Premier and Keqiang to return to China. Then there was the Battle of Zhennanguan. Although the matter did not succeed, the morale was further stimulated. The martyr especially took action to organize the Penang Reading Newspaper Agency with comrades, as an opportunity to call on heroes and communicate public opinion, and actively prepared to support the party members in the country. Then there was the Northern Expedition of Hekou. Later, the Hekou Party army collapsed without support, and 500 heroes were disarmed by the French government and passed through Annam, wandering to Nanyang, shabby and almost inhuman. The martyr feared that the Han Chinese warriors would lose their dignity, and immediately raised thousands of yuan to purchase clothing, so that they could change their clothes and guide them on the shore. Chinese and foreign residents saw that their clothing was uniform and their steps were neat, and they all respected them. The impression of revolutionary soldiers was deeply rooted in the minds of overseas Chinese. Later, party members from the mainland came to Nanyang in increasing numbers to promote fundraising and worked hard. The martyr and others were responsible for providing for their travel. The martyr also saw the indispensability of a public opinion organ, so he organized the Guanghua Daily with his comrades. Mr. Hu Hanmin happened to be on the island and asked him to write the stock prospectus and rules and regulations, which took several months to succeed. When Guanghua Daily was published, the martyr was elected as the general manager, and Lei Tieya and Zhang Dujuan presided over the editorial office. Later, Lei Tieya wrote a letter introducing comrades Song Dunchu and Dai Tianchou to take editorial responsibility. When Dai Tianchou came, Shouyin (referring to Tang Shouqian) occupied Wuhan and the uprising was stopped. Our party in Penang was able to establish a clear banner and wage a war of hearts with the opposition party, starting from this time. One year before the Republic of China, the Guangzhou Uprising was newly defeated and Ni Yingdian died. The Premier returned to Penang from Yokohama and reorganized the Tongmenghui on a larger scale as the headquarters of the Nanyang provinces. The martyr assisted day and night, never tired, and his examination of things was often to the point, and the comrades all believed in him, and the Premier especially regarded him as an assistant. At that time, the Premier lived in Penang, and comrades from overseas and inland came to discuss matters, and they saw each other on the road. All the hospitality, travel expenses, and travel expenses were subsidized by the martyr and his comrades. The Premier and his family lived at No. 404, Sikan Street Garden Side, and the monthly rent and daily expenses were also borne by the martyr and others. Then the Premier was expelled by the Siamese and British governments, and was rejected by the government of the dependent territories.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>He went to the Americas, and his family still lived in Penang, and all the expenses were still borne by the martyr and others. When Guangzhou failed, the elite were lost, and the comrades were all depressed and unable to recover. The Premier was worried and gathered Keqiang, Hanmin, Boxian, etc. in Penang to plan things, and was worried about economic difficulties. One day at the meeting, the martyr gave a generous speech at the table, urging the comrades with righteousness, and everyone was grateful. On the same day, he raised 8,000 gold and went to the provinces to raise funds, and he got 50,000 to 60,000 yuan in a few days, and the distant roads came every day. The Premier was able to get a comprehensive plan and set up an agency in Hong Kong to plan a major event. Before long, there was the Huanghuagang Uprising, which shocked the whole country. It was said that the Huanghuagang Uprising was the driving force behind the Wuchang Uprising, and the Penang comrades were the mainstay of the Huanghuagang Uprising, and the martyr was the mainstay. Months after the failure of the Huanghuagang Uprising, the news of the concentration of party members in Wuhan reached Nanyang. The martyr urgently summoned his comrades to actively raise funds, day and night, and sent tens of thousands of yuan to the Hong Kong headquarters before and after. The two provinces of Min and Yue subsidized each other's relief, and at the same time reorganized the Tongmenghui and organized the Overseas Chinese Bomb Team, the Northern Expedition Team, and the Gendarmerie Team. Driven by righteous indignation, people competed to die, and those who volunteered to return to the country to join the army followed in the way, all of which was the strength of the martyr's advocacy. After the restoration of Fujian, the martyr was elected by the comrades in each port as the representative to return to Fujian and arrived in Fuzhou and saw that everything was waiting to be done and urgently needed money. He immediately sent a telegram to Nanyang to ask for money. Each port received the martyr's telegram and raised money by telegram. Rangoon, Singapore, Penang, Java, and the Philippines all sent tens of thousands of yuan. The Fujian governor was greatly surprised and asked the martyr to represent the province to raise Nanyang public bonds, and the amount of money was quite large. He was so brave and trustworthy in the face of things. After the North and South were unified, the Tongmenghui reorganized the Kuomintang headquarters and sent Lu Zhiyi to Nanyang to reorganize party affairs. The martyr and Zhiyi ran to the British and Dutch colonies, calling on comrades and spreading the party's principles. Although the party affairs could not be made public due to the obstruction of the governments of the provinces, the wind spread and the people's hearts were shaken. Before long, Yuan Shikai became emperor and the Song case occurred. The martyr advocated the crusade against Yuan and advocated fundraising. Comrades at home and abroad responded in droves. However, justice was subject to power, and the crusade against Yuan failed. Martyr Chen Xinzheng</p>
<p>He is a party member with weak will, either changing his mind or disheartened. The martyr jumped up and said, "If you don't meet the deep-rooted trees, you can't see the sharp weapon. Although politics is impossible, education and industry are the foundation of governance. The affairs of the world are very important, and there are many ways to serve the country. Don't be discouraged, Tongnan." Because he actively advocated education, he donated all the profits from his private business to schools, and for the comrades who were exiled to the south at home and abroad, he tried to mediate the teaching positions in various schools to spread revolutionary seeds, and planned with Qiu Mingchang and others to organize the Xin Guomin Daily in Singapore, and greatly Zhang Qihui made a fierce attack on the Northern Warlords. Its scale was large, and its handling was firm and decisive. After the defeat of the Second Revolution, the Premier organized the Chinese Revolutionary Party in Tokyo and appointed the martyr as the Penang branch chief. The soldiers in Nanyang were sent to the new party organization without expressing sympathy. There were almost Tokyo faction and Nanyang faction in the party. The martyr reconciled in the middle and explained the misunderstanding, but it took hard work. At that time, Fujian was ruled by Li Houji, gathering and killing people and living a miserable life. The Minnan comrades secretly carried out the movement to overthrow Li and crusade against Yuan, but some advocated not cooperating with the Chinese Revolutionary Party, and the opinions were separated and did not cooperate with each other. The martyr was worried about it, and rushed to write to mediate, and raised tens of thousands of yuan in cash to set up an agency to cooperate with the two factions. At that time, the anti-Li movement in Min was not successful due to other relations, but the comrades were still able to work together in harmony, and united to proceed, which was the reason why the martyr had a broad mind and sincerity. The British governor of Singapore heard of the martyr's name and was very jealous. Because the martyr worked hard on the revolution in his country, his policy of dominating the colony would be adversely affected. The martyr was summoned to inquire about his actions and warned not to, otherwise he would leave the country. The martyr debated in court, eloquently, and the British governor could not be difficult, but he was also very afraid of him. When the dispute over the education regulations of the Malay Archipelago arose, the British officials accused the martyr of resisting the regulations and then Chen Minqing</p>
<p>He was arrested and transferred to Singapore, where he was jailed for two months and deported. After the martyr returned to China, he shifted his spirit and brainpower to promote the development of Fujian, and saw that his hometown was dominated by local tyrants, bandits were everywhere, education was not prosperous, and industry was not prosperous. Wang and others initiated the Heshan United Association, and the He people celebrated their foreheads. Unexpectedly, a group of local tyrants colluded with the Xiamen officials and had unfavorable news for the martyr. The martyr thought that the matter was impossible, so he went to Shanghai and discussed with his comrades in the south to overthrow Li, and took the initiative to raise funds, and went to Siam to open the Rijin Rice Mill, and supervised his younger brother Minqing and others to open a rubber garden and colonize financial resources, in order to prepare to serve the country. At the beginning of the business, it happened that the Eastern Route Crusade Army entered Fujian, the Self-Government Army entered Quanzhou Province, Governor Lin Sen, and sent repeated telegrams to the martyr to return to the country to assist in politics, so he drummed the wheels and returned to the country, arrived in Xiamen, the Minnan militia leaders, and the military and political circles in the provincial capital, and Xiamen agencies and social groups, welcomed Jiang Gan, and discussed major plans together. Governor Lin said that the martyr worked hard in the revolution and was believed by people at home and abroad, and repeatedly asked the martyr to be the chief of the Fujian Finance Department. The leaders of the Minnan militia also repeatedly asked him to be the chief of the Minnan Finance Department. The martyr agreed to do his best to help, but did not hold any name. Soon, the Minnan Martyrdom Comrades Memorial Meeting was initiated. Military and political circles publicly elected the martyr as the chairman, and Xu Ruwei, He Chengjun, Zhang Zhen, and others attended the meeting to express their condolences. Before long, he was ordered to go to Nanyang to raise funds, trek across the ocean, run and shout, his body and mind were exhausted, and he promoted party affairs and lectured everywhere, and his body was unable to support it. When he arrived in Siam, he fell ill and could not get up. It was the 13th of September in the 13th year of the Republic of China, and he was only forty-four years old. The martyr's physique was majestic, and it seemed that the forty-four years of the sun and the moon could not end his life. According to the doctor, the martyr's illness was an internal injury, and the root of the disease was latent when he was jailed in Singapore. Therefore, it is not impossible to ask the British imperialism to kill the martyr. On the day of his funeral, thousands of Chinese and foreign merchants sent him off, some came from thousands of miles away, and each port in Rangoon, Penang, and Xiamen Heshan held an extremely sad memorial service. Four years later, the National Government established its capital in Nanjing and unified the country, commending the martyr. The central government said that the martyr had devoted himself to the party, and gave him a pension at the end, and it was appropriate to build a monument to commemorate him. He ordered the Fujian Provincial Party Department to cooperate with the Provincial Government to be responsible for building the Chen Xinzheng Memorial Stele in Xiamen Zhongshan Park. In the future, the completion of the memorial stele will not only commemorate the martyr, but also encourage the comers. The martyr's old mother is still alive, his wife is Lin, his younger brother is Minqing, Minzhi, and Minyi, and there are one sister each, four sons, and seven daughters. His younger brother Minqing joined the Tongmenghui with the martyr and followed his brother to work hard in the revolutionary cause. After the martyr passed away, Minqing continued his brother's will, enthusiastic and promising, and responded to all public welfare undertakings at home and abroad. In the Northern Expedition and the Jinan case, he initiated the Wounded Soldiers and Refugees Relief Committee with his comrades in Penang, and coordinated with his comrades to do his best to solicit donations, totaling more than one million yuan to the National Government, all of which was the work of the martyr's influence.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Unfortunate Events in the Shipping Industry <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>A series of unfortunate events have befallen ships operating in the Yangtze River. Following the grounding of the Jiejiang-owned "Yibin" which was towed back to Shanghai for repairs, the "Yijiang," also known as "Jiejiang No. 2," which regularly travels between Yichang and Shashi to Shanghai, carrying a substantial amount of cargo, suffered a sudden steam pipe burst mid-journey. Initially unnoticed, upon reaching Jiujiang, the ship’s movement became sluggish. Inspection of the cargo hold by crew members revealed a crack in the hull caused by the steam pipe explosion, allowing river water to flood the compartment. This resulted in significant damage to the cargo. The ship urgently returned to Shanghai to unload the cargo and repair the steam pipe and the damaged hull. Upon inspection, over two hundred bales of cotton shipped from Shashi by Huachang were found to be soaked, resulting in substantial losses. An appraiser has assessed the damage, and a claim for compensation is being negotiated with the shipping company.</p>
<p>Relatives of the "Tongan" Victims Seek Compensation Following the sinking of the Zhaoxing Company’s "Tongan" by the company’s "Lianxing" near Chengshan Bay, resulting in the drowning of many passengers, bereaved families have formed a petition group. They have elected Tian Xingwu and Wang Jiusi as representatives to seek compensation from the company for the deceased. The representatives, noting the proximity of the accident site to Qingdao, first petitioned the Qingdao branch of Zhaoxing. The Qingdao manager, lacking the authority to handle the matter, forwarded the petition to the Shanghai head office for review. The bereaved families have also sent a letter to the Shanghai office requesting compensation of six hundred yuan per person, mirroring the compensation given to the families of workers who died in a Qingdao tobacco factory fire. The Shanghai office has not yet responded to this request.</p>
<p>The "New Yunnan" Reduced to an Empty Shell The saga of the "New Yunnan," which was seized and robbed in Diaoguan, has been previously reported in this newspaper. Further news indicates that after the vessel was initially looted and the crew kidnapped by bandits, the ship remained stranded in Diaoguan. Subsequently, bandits dismantled and looted the interior fittings, passenger accommodations, and deck fixtures. The vessel has now been stripped bare, and the machinery, doors, and other items have been removed. The ship has become a complete write-off. The total loss, including cargo, is estimated at around one million yuan. Compensation for Ship and Cargo Losses Following the grounding of the Taikoo Company's "Jintang" at Chenglingji, over two hundred bales of cotton yarn were abandoned due to bandit threats. The cargo was being transported from Shanghai to Yichang. The consignees have submitted claims for losses to Taikoo, which has agreed to reimburse them at the original cargo value. Furthermore, a large shipment of tobacco leaves transported from Hankou to Shanghai by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC) was subject to considerable theft upon arrival in Shanghai. The company has investigated on behalf of the clients and apprehended the thieves. To maintain its reputation and protect the clients' investment, the CMSNC will not only severely punish the thieves but also compensate for the missing goods at the market price.</p>
<p>Implementing the Gregorian Calendar for Account Settlement</p>
<h3 id="e122">Yangtze River Passenger Guild Halts Cargo Services <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Current State of Chinese Steamships After Resuming Service</p>
<p>A Sharp Decline in Upriver and Downriver Cargo</p>
<p>Chinese steamships on the Yangtze River resumed scheduled services this month after the completion of military transport duties, with each company aggressively trying to break the foreign monopoly and reclaim long-lost shipping rights. However, with the end of the Gregorian calendar year approaching and the implementation of the Gregorian calendar leading to the abolition of the lunar calendar, the passenger guild, due to financial considerations, has suspended cargo services, which has affected Yangtze River shipping. The current situation is detailed below:</p>
<p>Chinese Steamships that Have Resumed Service Among the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC) vessels that have resumed service are the "Jianghua," "Jiangshun," "Jiang’an," "Jiangda," "Jiangyu," "Jiangjing," and "Jianguo" – a total of seven ships. The Sanbei Company has resumed service with the "Changxing," "Chang’an," "Xin Ningxing," and "Guangxing." Zhaoxing has the "Yuxing" and "Zhaoxing," while Ningshao has the "Lao Ningshao."</p>
<p>Request to Release Temporarily Requisitioned Chinese Vessels This time, due to the Chairman's campaign to suppress bandits in Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, the "Jiangtian," "Jiangxin," "Kuaili," "Xingshi," "Yongxing," "Fulong," "Fengpu," and "Dexing" were temporarily requisitioned, and are expected to be released as soon as the anti-bandit troops arrive. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC) has requested the release of the "Si Jiang Xin Kuaili" and has been granted permission. The other vessels will also be released successively.</p>
<p>Lack of Chinese Steamships on the Middle Yangtze River On the middle Yangtze, the sector around Yichang, there are fifteen or sixteen British, Japanese, and American ships, while there is only one Chinese ship, the "Kuaili," which is currently out of service. Passengers in Yichang and Shashi have telegraphed Shanghai shipping companies requesting more ships to meet demand. The Sanbei Company rapidly completed the "Hongli" and dispatched her yesterday as the first Chinese ship to sail directly to Yichang from Shanghai. Due to a shortage of ships, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC) has temporarily dispatched four iron barges between Shanghai and Yichang. Changsha Cargo Piles Up, Ships Requested Chinese shipping in Changsha has been dormant for a long time. Last month, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC) dispatched the "Liyuan" and "Liji" to open the route. It is convenient to load goods for Xiang at Shanghai on Mondays and Thursdays, connecting in Hankou, according to the Xiang guild. Now, because the Xiang River water level has fallen to five feet six inches, and there is a large shipment of rice and cotton from Hunan to Shanghai, telegrams have been sent urging ships to be sent. Sanbei and China Merchants have both transferred shallow-water barges to load. Sanbei has also decided to dispatch the new "Hongzhen" on a direct Shanghai-Xiangsha route from January.</p>
<p>Sharp Decline in Export Business With the implementation of the Gregorian calendar for accounting this year, the Yangtze River passenger guild has stopped issuing loans because the silver houses have stopped lending. Shanghai merchants also require cash for goods, so in the last ten days, outbound cargo on the Yangtze has ceased, and export business has declined sharply. Foreign companies such as Nisshin, Taikoo, and Jardine, which have transshipment cargo, are only loading three or four tenths of a load, even less for Chinese ships. Yesterday, the "Changxing" of Sanbei and the "Ningshao" of Ningshao, heading to Hankou, only carried six or seven hundred taels of cargo each, which was not even enough to cover the cost of coal. There is little hope for Yangtze River business this year, and there is also a severe shortage of cargo coming to Shanghai.</p>

<p>More than ninety people attended the oath-taking ceremony for citizens held a few days ago in the Jingzhong, Yide, Wan'an, and Dongli townships of the Sanbeitang area of Pudong, in the fourth district of Shanghai County. The heads of the townships, Zhou Yuanliang and Shen Chengjiang, presided, and Bi Huan, the district chief, attended as supervisor. After performing the rituals, the citizens raised their hands and took the oath. The chairmen reported the significance of the oath-taking ceremony, and District Chief Bi delivered a speech, explaining the important matters of local autonomy. It is also reported that the Donglin, Tianzhang, and Jishen townships will hold separate ceremonies today and tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Report on a Major Loan to the Cuban Sugar Consortium <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>A Reuters report from Shanghai on the 11th states that there are rumours from Nanjing that a major Cuban sugar consortium is in talks with the Chinese authorities to invest between 300 million and 500 million US dollars in Chinese industries. It is said that the Cuban sugar consortium is most interested in China's sugar monopoly and road construction. However, these rumours have not been officially confirmed. A Mr. Pei Laitai, said to be a South American capitalist, recently visited the new capital with two legal advisors and several Chinese assistants. During his meeting with the Chinese government authorities, Mr. Pei Laitai proposed that the Cuban sugar industry invest 20 million US dollars to develop China's sugar industry and urged the National Government to actively adopt this plan. All raw sugar imported from Cuba into China would be exempt from taxes, and the Cuban sugar consortium would share profits equally with the Chinese government, with the Cuban sugar consortium enjoying a 20-year monopoly on the Chinese sugar market. At the end of the 20-year period, the National Government would be able to take over its assets and interests in China and be compensated. However, the Chinese authorities rejected this proposal because China imports approximately 100 million taels of silver worth of sugar annually, and the government collects approximately 15 million yuan in sugar taxes each year. The Cuban sugar consortium's plan is unlikely to increase the Chinese government's revenue. The sugar consortium then greatly changed its conditions, rumoured to be willing to invest 20 million US dollars specifically for Chinese sugar production. Cuban sugar imports would still be subject to taxation, and there would be no monopoly in China. However, the Cuban sugar consortium would receive five percent of the profits from this business. It is said that the contract has not yet been agreed upon, and the negotiations are still in the initial stages. Mr. Pei Laitai is currently collecting information from the Ministry of Railways regarding highway and railway development. According to him, although the Cuban sugar consortium was originally focused on developing China's sugar industry, it also plans to invest tens of millions of US dollars in Chinese construction projects.</p>

<h3 id="e126">A Glimpse of the Economic Downturn <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Published by the Japanese Commercial Office in Shanghai</p>
<p>Import Surplus for the First Eleven Months of This Year</p>
<p>The Japanese Commercial Counselor in Shanghai received an official telegram from Tokyo on December 11th, stating that the total value of Japan's foreign trade import and export from January to November this year reached 2,800,000,000 yen, with an import surplus of 93,000,000 yen. This is an increase of 25,000,000 yen compared to the import surplus for the same period last year. The main exports were raw silk, silk textiles, and cotton textiles, totaling 670,000,000 yen. Compared to the same period last year, raw silk and silk products decreased by 50%, and cotton textiles decreased by 34%. The main imports were raw cotton, iron, machinery, wool, and timber, all of which decreased compared to the same period last year. During these eleven months, Japan's export trade to China was worth 369,000,000 yen, with an export surplus of 110,000,000 yen, a decrease of 50,000,000 yen compared to the export surplus for the same period last year. Looking at the overall commercial situation this year, the phenomenon of the economic downturn in Japan is evident. The budget for 1931 has been set at 1,448,000,000 yen, a decrease of 160,000,000 yen compared to last year. The government is currently discussing reducing the tax burden on the people and using relief bonds and funds saved from the London Naval Treaty to make up for it.</p>

<p>Eloquent Speech Yesterday</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News reports that the British Police Court opened the trial of Indian Su Yangxin this morning (12th) on charges of distributing seditious writings. Su gave an eloquent speech in court, claiming that he would rather be imprisoned than enjoy freedom under British rule. Although his actions were to appeal for the rights of himself and his compatriots, he did not expect the benevolence of the British government. After he joined the army in 1918, he had received the government's favour, and at that time, the government promised autonomy to the Indians, ordered the Indians to wish for the victory of the British army, and when the war ended, martial law was declared in India, and taxes were levied, even on weddings. Today, we appeal for our inherent rights, and are called seditious. If the British government does not abandon India, we Indians are willing to drive them out by force. After the defendant finished his statement, the questioner told him that this kind of speech was useless to him, the preliminary hearing had already been established, and he was to be sent to the High Court for interrogation. The defendant was accused of being detained on the 11th for distributing reactionary leaflets at the intersection of North Henan Road and Tiantong Road.</p>

<p>Letter to the Civil Court President of the French Concession</p>
<p>Stating the Origins of Dong Yu's Marriage</p>
<p>Cannot Be Abused by Inappropriately Applying Disability</p>
<p>Dong Kang wrote to the Civil Court President of the French Concession on behalf of his client, Dong Yu, in a divorce case with his wife, Ms. Jiang, stating that the Court President, Dong Jingxi, namely Dong Yu, has filed a suit to divorce his wife, Ms. Jiang. The court heard the case on the 3rd of this month and ordered that a reconciliation be attempted within two weeks. Now, I have received a summons to continue the hearing on the 11th. Kang, as a witness in this case, should state the facts of the case to your Honour. Dong Yu is a relative of Kang. Kang recommended him as a clerk in the Jiangsu and Shandong High Courts. In the tenth year of the Republic, Kang was asked to introduce him to Ms. Jiang Youzhi, the great-granddaughter of Jiang Renjing of Anhui, as his wife. Initially, one matchmaker was Mr. Chen (Ms. Jiang's brother-in-law) and the other was Fan Zhaochang. The betrothal was made at Kang's residence. In the winter of that year, it was rumoured that Dong Yu had formally married Ms. Lu, the daughter of Lu Zhipeng of Haimen, in Shandong. At that time, Kang was the Minister of Justice and telegraphed him to Beijing, advising him to cancel the marriage contract with Ms. Jiang to avoid future complications. Dong Yu insisted that the status of his wife and concubine was no different, and there would be no disagreement. In the eleventh year, Kang was sent to travel in Europe and the United States. In that year, Dong Yu used Kang's name as the wedding officiant to hold the wedding with Ms. Jiang in Shanghai. They lived together for a year and had a daughter. Because the treatment was not equal, she often lived with her mother and relatives. Last year, after persuasion from relatives and friends, they reunited and welcomed Ms. Jiang home again. In October of this year, Ms. Lu died of measles. Dong Yu asked his cousin, Ms. He Dong, to suggest to Ms. Jiang that they divorce. Ms. Jiang did not agree. Afterwards, she personally visited Kang and repeated her previous statement. Kang believed that the divorce proposal was strange because it was made after Ms. Lu's death, not before, and strongly advised against it. Unexpectedly, Dong Yu then requested a divorce from Ms. Jiang in your court, claiming that she had a long-standing liver disease and citing precedents from the Dali Yuan to support his claim. An investigation into marriage between men and women reveals that prior notice must be given in the case of disabilities. The effective part of the penal code in the preceding Qing dynasty recognizes, the law originated from Tang Code and Annotated Commentary, says, status should be three disease, body not intact, three disease is severe illness, disability and chronic illness is total name. Cannot work because of severe disability, body not intact, hidden disease is sky eunuch, women cannot birth, body not intact. Based on annotations, do not abuse. Kang was in the Imperial Judiciary for four terms, a total of eight years, and the issued judgements were verified. There is no precedent like this. Moreover, Ms. Jiang is usually healthy, and it has not been heard that she has any disease. Kang recently ordered Dong Yu to go home and persuaded him to follow the order to mediate. Dong Yu prepared a divorce contract, roughly in the name of a deposit of three thousand yuan, giving Ms. Jiang eight percent interest per month. At the end, it also stated that the man and woman's marriage should not interfere with each other. Ms. Jiang also agreed that the couple should live separately and set conditions. If it is said that she was abandoned, she only knows to follow one person to the end, and she is not happy to hear anything else. Kang happened to be going to Yu for business, and he did not know what happened to the negotiations after that. I think that Your Honour is clear-minded and will see the slightest flaw. Ms. Jiang comes from a large family and has encountered such a situation, which is not without pity. The purpose she holds is not without the virtue of a woman. I still ask for a time limit to try to reconcile. If it is not compatible, I can only wait for Your Honour to judge according to the law. Kang originally intended to go to court to make a statement today, but he returned from Yu yesterday and felt ill on the way, so he entrusted Lawyer Wang to convey his message. I hope you will take note of this. Yours respectfully, Dong Kang, the tenth day.</p>
<p>Fake Warehouse Receipt</p>
<h3 id="e132">Cheated More Than 10,000 Gold <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Wing Hang Bank Sues Xu Xiangfu et al.</p>
<p>Defrauded a Large Amount of Money Twice with Fake Warehouse Receipts</p>
<p>Wing Hang Bank, located at 196 Ningbo Road, was recently defrauded of 10,467.8 taels of silver with fake warehouse receipts by Xu Xiangfu and others from Zhejiang. After the bank discovered the fraud, it reported it to the General Police Station, which sent Detective Wu Chunrong to arrest Xu and hand him over to the Special District Local Court for questioning. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhou Hanting opened the court to question him. Ruyi Bao, the lawyer of the police station, stated the circumstances of the defendant's deception, saying that the defendant, Xu Xiangfu, was the accountant of Shengfeng Yarn and Cotton Company at 510 Tianjin Road. Shengfeng had business dealings with Wing Hang since March this year, and its credit was still good. On the 1st of this month, Cai Qingzhang, a Wing Hang broker, brought two warehouse receipts from Shengfeng, one for 130 bales of cotton and the other for 170 bales of cotton. The goods were stored in the Nanshi Dachu Company. He wanted to mortgage them for 3,622.86 taels of silver. Wing Hang did not suspect it was fake and accepted the mortgage, paying two bills, one for 2,972.86 taels and the other for 650 taels. On the 5th of this month, Cai brought three warehouse receipts for 487 bales of cotton and mortgaged them to Wing Hang for 6,845 taels of silver. The mortgagor and the storage location were the same as before. The bank also accepted them and paid them all in promissory notes. The next day, Wing Hang, for the sake of caution, sent shop assistant Li Afu to Shengfeng with the warehouse receipts to inquire. The defendant Xu Xiangfu was at the store and, in addition to verbally acknowledging it, stamped the Shengfeng seal on the warehouse receipts to strengthen Wing Hang's trust. The bank then sent Zhang Quanfu to inquire with Dachu Company about the warehouse receipts. Dachu told him that Shengfeng had no goods stored there, and the warehouse receipts were not issued by Dachu. Zhang reported the situation to the bank manager, who then sent Vice President Sun Xueqiao to Shengfeng to ask Xu. Xu claimed that the warehouse receipts belonged to Xu Hao, the owner of Shengfeng, and that he did not know the truth. Sun felt that Xu Xiangfu's words were vague and reported him to the police station. He denied being the accountant of Shengfeng and said that he was the small owner of Yongxinglong Customs Broker. After the police station detained the defendant, detailed investigations revealed that the address of Shengfeng was actually the address of Yongxinglong Customs Broker, and Shengfeng was only a sign hanging at the door, with no other equipment. Therefore, the two firms were actually one and the same. Later, it was heard that Xu Hao lived at 19 Baoshan Road. When detectives were sent to arrest him, he had already escaped in advance. As for the promissory notes paid by Wing Hang twice, the one for 650 taels had already been deposited in the Zhengxiang Qianzhuang on Doushi Street in Nanshi. Of the four notes given the second time, the defendant deposited two notes of 2,250 taels and 1,300 taels in the name of Yongxinglong into the Tongan Qianzhuang at 364 Henan Road, but then withdrew them, and Tongan gave him banknotes. The remaining two notes were initially deposited in the Tongji Qianzhuang at 250 Tianjin Road, because Yongxinglong also had dealings with Tongxing and owed Tongxing money, so they could not be withdrawn immediately. Later, because the situation was urgent and Wing Hang's note had not yet expired, they were taken back from Tong'an Qianzhuang, and Xu Hao took them away. According to Qianzhuang regulations, this kind of note is no different from cash. It should be requested to issue a ticket to quickly bring Xu Hao and Cai Qingzhang to the case. Then, Sun Xueqiao proved that the defrauding process was similar to the lawyer's statement. Judge Zhou asked Xu Xiangfu, and Xu completely blamed the matter on Xu Hao alone. The judge ordered him to hand over Xu Hao to the case as soon as possible, otherwise, he would be held responsible. The case was adjourned for seven days for hearing.</p>

<p>Life Possibly in Danger</p>
<p>Xu Laifa, a man from Hangzhou, around thirty years old, boarded the Shanghai-Songhu passenger train from Shanghai at approximately 2 PM yesterday. He intended to visit a friend surnamed He at a certain school in Baotaiwan. After the train stopped at the Wusong Town station, the melon-rind satin hat Xu was wearing suddenly fell out the window. Xu quickly got off the train to pick up the hat. Unexpectedly, the train started moving, causing him to fall. His head struck the edge of the cement platform, causing severe injuries to his face and severing his left ear. He fainted next to the tracks due to the extreme pain. The driver immediately stopped the train. The stationmaster ordered a porter to help Xu up. He was bleeding profusely, and his face was a bloody mess, a terrible sight. They woke him up, helped him back onto the train, and sent him back to Shanghai for treatment at the railway hospital. However, his injuries were severe, and it is unknown whether he will survive.</p>

<p>Special Order During the Winter Defense Period</p>
<p>Yuan, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, recently considered the importance of winter defense. In addition to issuing orders to the subordinate district offices to increase the number of patrol officers and organize patrol teams to patrol all night, he also sent police squad leaders and officers to be stationed in the jurisdictions of each district office to assist in protection. Considering that hotels and inns are most prone to harboring bandits, inspections cannot be relaxed in the slightest. Yesterday, he also notified the subordinate district offices to send police officers to inspect all large and small hotels and inns within their jurisdiction twice every night, in the first and second halves of the night. If suspicious travelers are encountered, they should be questioned in detail about their origins and destinations to prevent evildoers from hiding within the territory and to maintain public security.</p>

<p>Initiated by the Hebron Church</p>
<p>Held on the Evening of the 17th</p>
<p>The local Hebron Church will hold a Hanukkah dance party at the Grand Hua Hotel on the evening of the 17th. Hanukkah is an ancient Jewish holiday. In the past, pagans invaded Palestine. The famous Jewish general Maccabees fought and defeated the invaders, and the Jewish state was preserved. This battle was crucial to the fate of the Jewish state and the survival of its religion. Therefore, Jewish people attach great importance to it and regard the day of victory as a major holiday of the year. The local Hebron Church often holds dance parties on this day. The program is very grand and is considered the best for the time being. The proceeds from ticket sales will be allocated to the Jewish National Fund and the local Jewish Education Assistance Association's expenses.</p>

<p>The Lusida sandboat Gu Fa Shun was loaded with more than 700 dan of red dates from Jiaozhou to Shanghai for unloading. It sailed into the Wusongkou a few days ago and anchored on the Huangpu Riverbank opposite Wusong Town. The boat owner, Gu Guisheng, went ashore to take a car to Shanghai to send a letter to the Hakka people. Unexpectedly, when he returned to Wusong yesterday afternoon, the sandboat had disappeared, and the crew of more than ten people were also missing. At that time, the boat owner searched everywhere in the river but found nothing. He didn't know where the sandboat had sailed to, and he was baffled. Later, an importing sandboat reported that they had seen the Gu Fa Shun boat being robbed and that it had sailed to the outer sea. Only then did the boat owner realize that the boat had been hijacked by bandits. However, considering that there were many sailing boats in the Huangpu River and that it was the location of the naval and land police garrisons, there had never been a case of boat robbery before. In the end, he felt that the doubts were unresolved and immediately reported to the water police for investigation.</p>

<p>Song Jinyao, from Tianjin, specialized in peddling counterfeit banknotes for private counterfeiters in Shanghai. This was discovered by a certain detective, who bought counterfeit notes from Song, agreeing on a price of 15 yuan for every 100 yuan. The detective wanted to buy 400 yuan and arranged to pay at No. 43 Rixin Lane, Seward Road, a few days ago. He reported to the Hongkou Police Station, and detectives such as Sun Afu were sent to wait near the lane at the appointed time. The detective secretly marked the real banknotes prepared for payment. Soon, Song arrived at the agreed place with forty counterfeit 10-yuan notes for exchange. As soon as he came out to the lane entrance, he was arrested by the detectives. They searched him and found 60 yuan of the proceeds, as well as</p>

<p>one counterfeit 5-yuan note. He was taken to the police station and handed over to the Special District Local Court yesterday. According to Song's confession, someone named Jia instructed him to deliver the notes and promised to pay him a reward of six yuan. He did not know where the private counterfeiting operation was located. He also claimed that the counterfeit notes found were definitely not his. Judge Ge ordered the defendant to be detained for a future hearing.</p>

<p>Escaped Back to Her Mother's Home in Pudong</p>
<p>Madam Still Attempting to Recover Her</p>
<p>Geng Yao, a woman from Rugao, forty-three years old, lives at No. 18 Diandang Lane, Lannidu, Pudong. Her husband, Geng, died of illness last summer. She has no children. She has a daughter, twenty-five years old, who is already married. There is an adopted daughter, Zhao Di, who is sixteen years old, with a beautiful face and clever intelligence, still unmarried. Since her husband's death, Yao's family has fallen into decline, with debts piling up, unable to cope. Unable to do otherwise, on July 2nd of the lunar calendar this year, she pawned Zhao Di into the Wei surname brothel, No. 1 Tongzhi Lane, near Baxianqiao in the French Concession, to be a prostitute. Ren Wang and others acted as intermediaries, agreeing on a pawn price of seventy yuan, for a term of six months. Both the people and money were handed over immediately. Because Zhao Di was young and beautiful, customers flocked to her as soon as she entered the brothel. The Madam saw that the prostitution business was booming and regarded Zhao Di as a cash cow. However, Zhao Di catered to customers day and night, unable to bear the suffering. Two weeks ago, she escaped from the fiery pit and sneaked back to her mother's home in Pudong. The former intermediary Ren Wang was sent to Pudong to negotiate with Zhao Di's mother, Yao. Yao was willing to return the pawn price of seventy yuan, but Ren said that the Madam wanted 192 yuan before the pawn contract could be handed over; otherwise, Zhao Di would still have to go to make up the date. As soon as Zhao Di heard this, her heart was on fire. She went to the No. 3 District of the Public Security Bureau to report for assistance. The District Chief immediately ordered a patrol officer to go with her and bring Ren Wang and Zhao Di's mother, Yao, to the district. According to Geng Yao's statement, her daughter Zhao Di was adopted at the age of three and treated as her own. In fact, after her husband's death, she owed funeral expenses and was forced to pawn her into the brothel, receiving a price of seventy yuan, deducting expenses, and netting sixty-three yuan. Now she is willing to return the pawn price and take her back to marry someone else. Please investigate. Zhao Di testified that she had been prostituting for more than two months since her mother pawned her into the brothel, earning more than ten yuan a night if she was lucky, and no less than five or six yuan if she was not. She has earned more than 300 yuan in total, but the suffering is unbearable. She vows that she is unwilling to engage in a life of prostitution and requests assistance. Ren Wang testified that she was thirty-seven years old, from Sanjiang, and lived at No. 10 Huangpu Road, Datiebang. There were four people in total, including herself, who acted as intermediaries for Zhao Di. Now Zhao Di escaped before the term was up. The brothel was asking her for the person, so she came to Pudong to look for her, etc. The District Chief considered that this case involved social morality and humanity and ruled that the people involved would be transferred to the</p>

<p>Reconciled with Fei Manqian as Before</p>
<p>Tang Xueqian, the wife of Fei Manqian, a movie star, disappeared suddenly after an argument with her husband. She has now been found, and the two have reconciled as before. The details are recorded below. Fei Manqian, from Zhejiang, worked in the newspaper industry. Later, he co-edited publications with Xu Zhimo, Yang Qingyin, and others at the National Art Exhibition Preparatory Office of the Ministry of Education. His writings have appeared in various newspapers and magazines. Three years ago, he and his wife Tang Xueqian worked as actors at the Xifan Film Company. Later, Fei took on other work and served as a screenwriter at the Ruilong Film Company, Jincheng, and Five Star Film Company. Ms. Tang Xueqian, from Shandong, followed her father to Shanghai when she was young. Her father was a maritime tycoon. Because she was skilled in martial arts, she served as the director of the women's division of the Jingwu Athletic Association. She loved Peking Opera and performed on stage to great acclaim. She also studied painting with the famous painter Yang Qingyin. Their marriage was difficult because Tang's mother did not approve, but they finally achieved their goal. Last spring, they had a son named Qingbai, who is unusually strong. This summer, they had another daughter. They are very interested in family life. It is conceivable that they respect and love each other since they have achieved such happiness. Therefore, they have been married for three years without any quarrels and are exceptionally harmonious. On the evening of the 9th, there was a misunderstanding over a trivial matter, which led to an argument. On the morning of the 10th, Tang went out alone, resulting in yesterday's news. Fortunately, Fei sent out scouts and was able to rescue her. Now, with the mediation of friends, they have reconciled.</p>

<p>Zhang Juqing, a woman from Ningbo, twenty-two years old, loved freedom and fell in love with Wan Bingzhong, who worked at Lao Deji Pharmacy, in June three years ago. On the 21st of the same month, Wan seduced her to open a room at the Jiangnan Hotel and, after a free engagement, engaged in cohabitation. She became pregnant for seven months. Unexpectedly, Wan abandoned the old for the new and, after getting acquainted with another woman, falsely claimed in May of this year that his business was suspended and that he planned to go to Nanjing to find work. Since then, he abandoned Juqing and never met again. Later, Juqing met Wan's friend Feng on the road and learned that Wan was still in Shanghai, so she went to find him. Unexpectedly, Wan said that she was not worthy to be his wife. Juqing was extremely angry and took Wan Bingzhong to the No. 2 District No. 2 Branch a few days ago. Because the case concerned a marital dispute, it was transferred to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. After investigation, the Public Security Bureau found that free love was a civil matter and ordered her to file a lawsuit in court. At that time, Juqing said that Wan Bingzhong was actually guilty of abduction, rape, and abandonment and demanded severe punishment. Because abduction and rape are private prosecution crimes, they should be prosecuted by the parents. She was still ordered to file a lawsuit in court. Yesterday (the 12th) at 8 AM, Zhang Juqing's biological mother, Zhang Dong, heard that her daughter had been abducted, raped, and abandoned, and that she was pregnant. Now Wan abandoned her without any concern, which she could not bear. She took Juqing to Wan Bingzhong's residence (No. 90 Yangjiafangchang) to question Wan and made a big fuss. Unexpectedly, Wan was unreasonable. She called Wang Xuehe, a guard from the No. 2 District No. 1 Branch No. 28 Post, who brought the people and witnesses to the station. After interrogation by Director Qian, it was found that Wan Bingzhong had committed abduction, rape, and abandonment against Zhang Juqing. It was ordered that he be sent to the Public Security Bureau Headquarters for legal action.</p>

He applied to the Old Gate Police Station for assistance and rushed to arrest He Guisheng from Shaanxi, Gao Jinyuan from Anhui, Zhou Shaoqing, Zhang Rongsheng, and four others. They were handed over to the Special District Local Court yesterday. The Police Station lawyer stated that if the Municipal Public Security Bureau wanted to transfer them, it should be ordered to prove the defendants' criminal evidence. Because the Municipal Public Security Bureau did not submit the evidence in time, Judge Zhou ordered a postponement and the defendants were temporarily detained at the Police Station pending further investigation.</p>

He spared no effort to relieve disasters and help his neighbors, and he always tried his best to generously donate. He was still mindful of the karmic causes and effects, and he strictly guarded his body, mouth, and mind. It is appropriate that a family that accumulates good deeds is blessed by heaven with a hundred blessings. Orchids and magnolias grow in the courtyard, and people envy the ranks of jade shoots. Financial management and administration are for the benefit of the country. He followed the law and simplified punishments to protect the people. In this age of decline, we are fortunate to admire the great man. He is a guide to ethics and a model for all ages. Why was He Wu Yang summoned so quickly? He flew high on a crane. From now on, where will we place our trust? The vast sky has broken our pillar. Tracing his appearance and voice, where can we find them? We cannot bear to look at the flying white banner. We offer a handful of fresh grass, and may your spirit appreciate my loyalty. Although words are limited, our grief is long. Alas, enjoy!" Also, the memorial text of Zhizhi College, the words are long and omitted.</p>

<p>Speech at the Welcoming Banquet the Previous Evening</p>
<p>Zhang Fang, member of the Henan Provincial Government and concurrently Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Commander-in-Chief of the 20th Route Army, and Chairman of the Henan Relief Committee, arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 9th from Beijing.  Fellow Henan provincials in Shanghai, Fan Zhengbo and Ren Taoyu, held a welcoming meeting at the East Asia Building at 6:00 PM on the 11th.  About two to three hundred Henan natives attended.  Chairman Fan Zhengbo delivered a welcoming speech, to which Mr. Zhang responded with extreme humility and concern for his homeland.  The measures he proposed were well-organized.  His speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>"I am truly unworthy of the welcome extended to me by my fellow provincials today.  I bear a responsibility, both publicly and privately, for the relief of Henan.  However, in recent months, there has been little improvement in the disaster situation in Henan.  I already feel deeply ashamed and dare not accept your welcome.  However, I would like to take this opportunity to report on the disaster in Henan and the reasons for my visit to Shanghai.  I believe that all of you are concerned about our homeland and will be eager to hear and willing to offer guidance.  Henan has always been known as a region of frequent warfare.  Over the years, it has suffered from military disasters, as you all know.  Since 1920, there have been droughts, floods, locusts, and hailstorms, coupled with the rampant activities of bandits.  Ordinary people simply cannot live a decent life.  Since the success of the revolution, the people had hoped for a better future.  Who would have thought that the recent rebellion instigated by Yan and Feng would focus on Henan?  The loss of life and property, both direct and indirect, suffered by the people is incalculable, especially in the forty-eight counties, including Kaifeng and Chenliu.  Therefore, I recently petitioned the central government to provide relief through the following measures: (1) establish soup kitchens and shelters for women and children in the aforementioned forty-eight counties; (2) fill in war trenches, repair roads and the Yellow River dike to create jobs; (3) establish grain stabilization bureaus to stabilize grain prices; (4) provide loans of cattle, tools, and seeds to the people to restore cultivation; (5) continue to transport disaster victims to the eastern provinces for settlement and border consolidation.  If these five measures can be effectively implemented, at least ten million yuan will be required.  If this can be achieved, the disaster victims in Henan may have a glimmer of hope.  Recently, the relief efforts in Henan have been greatly assisted by the enthusiastic help of various charitable organizations in Shanghai.  The thirty million disaster victims in the province are immensely grateful.  Therefore, on behalf of all the disaster victims in the province, I respectfully express my thanks.  However, as you philanthropists are scattered in various places, and my time in Shanghai is limited, I am afraid I may not be able to visit all of you.  I hope you will understand.  In addition, there is one thing I hope all of you present will consider, and that is the issue of self-help.  Because the disaster in Henan is too severe, government funding may not be enough to fully save everyone.  If you can all unite and appeal to people everywhere to understand the disaster situation in Henan, arouse their benevolence, and generously donate funds, every penny more will bring a penny more of benefit to the disaster victims in Henan.  These are my humble opinions, and I ask that you not hesitate to give me your guidance, which I eagerly await day and night."  After Mr. Zhang finished his speech, the entire building erupted in thunderous applause.  Afterwards, a banquet was held in Mr. Zhang's honor, and the guests and host enjoyed themselves immensely before departing.</p>
<p>Yesterday at noon, Zhang Fang hosted a banquet for people from all walks of life at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.  Cai Yuanpei, Jiao Yitang, Zhang Yuejun, Wang Yiting, Fan Zhengbo, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Yansong, Xu Jinyuan, Xu Junren, Yuan Liang, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Fang Jiaobo, Shang Mujiang, Lü Gongwang, Gu Zhuxuan, Wang Xiaolai, Lu Bohong, Ye Huijun, and over a hundred others attended.  During the banquet, Mr. Zhang delivered a speech first, followed by speeches from Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Yuejun, Wang Yiting, and others, all expressing deep sorrow.  The guests and host parted on amicable terms around 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Railway Bureau Remedies for Passenger Train Delays <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The East Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau and its Train Operations Department, concerned about passenger complaints due to recent delays in various passenger trains, and in the midst of railway reorganization, could not allow such delays to damage the railway's reputation.  Therefore, they convened a meeting of various section chiefs at the bureau the day before yesterday to discuss solutions.  It was decided that before the new locomotives were installed, personnel would be dispatched to conduct on-site investigations along the railway line to determine the causes of the delays and take remedial measures.  Deputy Director Zheng Huozhao of the Train Operations Department was assigned to be responsible for the investigation, and the Director of the Locomotive Department was instructed to order all drivers to exercise caution and strive to avoid delays.  It is learned that Director Zheng Huozhao, after receiving his orders, set off yesterday morning at 6:00 AM on an express train to conduct the investigation.  However, according to personnel at the bureau, the delays, in terms of responsibility, should be attributed to the Locomotive Department.  The poor quality of the coal purchased by the Purchasing Committee on behalf of the railway is the primary cause.  The oil inside the axles also has a significant impact.  In the past, the axle oil used could average up to one hundred revolutions before overheating, but the current oil can only withstand about three hundred revolutions before overheating.  Occasionally, axles overheat, rendering the trains unusable and causing delays due to the time required for disassembly.  Additionally, the arrival of winter causes the heat from the locomotives to be affected by the cold weather, inevitably reducing speed.  As for the Train Operations Department, it has exhausted all possible methods to remedy the situation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee held its sixty-ninth session yesterday.  Chairman Tao Yishan presided over the meeting, observed the usual formalities, and reported on ongoing matters (omitted).

I would like to clarify that Mr. Shiying's visit yesterday was purely a personal matter and that he was not entrusted by Deputy Commander Zhang to represent him. I would appreciate it if you could correct the record. Respectfully yours, Xu Shiying, December 12.</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding the news report that Mr. Liu Renqing died of suffocation due to family troubles. According to Mr. Liu Zhao, Mr. Liu Renqing established the Yihe Yong Clock Factory. Mr. Zhao and Mr. Liu have been living together in Shanghai for many years. There has never been a Mrs. Chen. All of the factory's capital was raised by Mr. Zhao and Mr. Liu in their hometown. There are still outstanding debts.</p>
<p>The report contains many errors. It is likely based on hearsay. I request that you correct the record. Sincerely, Liu Zhao, December 12.</p>

<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>Flying love bullets. Armor is not enough to resist.</p>
<p>Long trips are lonely. Reading the newspaper at this time is the most comprehensive.</p>
<p>A small shop always posts its market name, saying that it is the world, the globe, or the Far East. This shows the exaggeration of the national character.</p>
<p>All the world's most complex machinery is not enough to match the minds of writers.</p>
<p>If a woman's mysterious door could be moved to her forehead, it would reduce much adultery and wickedness.</p>
<p>Writers are not afraid of writing, but they are afraid of copying. Calligraphers are not afraid of writing, but they are afraid of grinding ink.</p>
<p>When you find a childhood photo, you laugh at first and then feel emotional.</p>
<p>A shelf of books, a window of bamboo, a wall of paintings, a stove of incense, a jug of wine, and a pot of flowers are enough to be called six recluses.</p>
<p>The market price of love has become cheaper and cheaper in recent years. It can be bought with a small amount of gold.</p>
<p>Most rich people are willing to hide beauties in golden houses but are unwilling to shelter scholars in mansions.</p>
<p>We should not look at people with white eyes, nor should we envy people with red eyes.</p>
<p>Closing the door and sweeping away dust, there is joy in this.</p>
<p>The three words "model" are sacred terms in art. If they are called "sensual," then there is contempt.</p>
<p>Reading in the toilet is lewd, but it is interesting.</p>
<p>If you want to urinate on the road, you can seek it from the poisonous door advertisement.</p>
<p>Drawing portraits of ladies, chanting erotic poems, and writing sad novels are most likely to move a woman's heart.</p>
<p>A non-clever person cannot say witty words.</p>
<p>The Western movie star, Lang Qui Nai, has the reputation of having a thousand faces. Unexpectedly, this kind of art is also well performed by our country's dignitaries and politicians.</p>
<h3 id="e173">On One of the First Students Studying Abroad from Pudong <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Juemi</p>
<p>In the winter of the tenth year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty, Zeng Wenzhenggong of Xiangxiang, the Nanyang Minister and Governor-General of Liangjiang, commissioned Xu Yuzhi of Shanghai to select 30 young children each year for four years to send to the United States to study various subjects. The first batch selected were Zeng Dugong, Liang Dunyan, Deng Tucong, Cai Jinzhang, Zhang Renkang, Zhong Juncheng, Shi Jintang, Qian Wenkui, He Tingliang, Huang Xibao, Zhan Tianyou, Pan Mingzhong, Cao Jifu, Liu Jiazhao, Zhu Shangzhou, Huang Zhongliang, Mu Yongquan, Cai Shaoji, Huang Kaijia, Shi Jinyong, Chen Ronggui, Cheng Daqi, Ouyang Geng, Chen Jurong, Zhong Wenyao, Wu Yangzeng, Rong Shangqian, Luo Guorui, Tan Yaoxun, and Kuang Rongguang, thirty people in total. They departed in July of the following year. Most of them were from Guangdong Province, accounting for 24 people. The remaining six people were from Jiangsu Province, accounting for three people; Shandong Province, accounting for one person; Anhui Province, accounting for one person; and Fujian Province, accounting for one person. Rong Shangqian and Kuang Rongguang were the youngest, both ten years old. Next were Pan Mingzhong, Zhu Shangzhou, Wu Yangzeng, and Tan Yaoxun, all eleven years old. Then came Zhan Tianyou, Liu Jiazhao, and Luo Guorui, all twelve years old. Then came He Tingliang, Huang Xibao, Cao Jifu, Huang Kaijia, and Chen Jurong, all thirteen years old. The rest were fourteen, fifteen, or sixteen years old. There were none over sixteen years old. Among them, Cao Jifu was from our Chuansha. He went to the United States to study law. After returning to China, he first worked in the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau and later as a clerk in the Shanghai British Magistrate's Office. At that time, the British Magistrate was the Royal Lawyer Wilkinson. Since obtaining Mr. Jifu as a clerk, the host and guests got along well, and he ended his life as a clerk. Mr. Jifu had one son and four daughters. With the income he earned throughout his life, he built five houses and distributed them to his children, which is comparable to Mr. Du Jicheng, a poet of the Ming Dynasty and a fellow villager of our hometown, who built seven houses in one day and gave them to his six sons, keeping one for himself. Mr. Jifu's daughter married Dr. Yan Huiqing of Shanghai. His son went to the United States at a young age to study the navy. After graduating, a certain US Secretary of State, because of his youth and handsomeness, even wanted to marry him to a daughter. He had already been betrothed to a woman in his hometown. At this point, he broke off the engagement and married the American woman. After marrying her, he became a citizen of the United States. He never returned to China. The American government also promoted him and assigned him to the navy. According to the villagers, he has now been promoted to commander of a fleet. So today, there is a Chinese person serving as commander in the US Navy. This is glorious for our country. It is a pity that our country's navy cannot be rejuvenated and made a difference because of a lack of warships and talent and cannot compete with the great powers today. Having gained the heavy trust of the United States and having been promoted to commander of a fleet, he must be a naval talent. Our country has this talent, but it is being used by Jin. This is a great pity for our country. Only sixteen or seventeen years have passed since Mr. Jifu's death, but his wife is still alive. She sometimes receives letters from her son, and she also writes back, but he does not return to China. He will probably live a wealthy and honorable life in the United States and never return to China.</p>

<p>— Wan Cheng</p>
<p>In winter, people often reside indoors. The air is stagnant, exercise is lacking, and work is excessive, which can easily lead to constipation and impure blood. Therefore, it is advisable to eat more fruits.</p>
<p>Heaven is truly generous to mankind. In winter, there is the orange, as if intentionally provided for human consumption. Oranges are very rich in plant-based oxygen. The benefits of this oxygen are fivefold: (1) It prevents the retention of uric acid, purifies the blood, and prevents various diseases such as gout, while promoting metabolism. (2) It stimulates the stomach and intestines, facilitating bowel movements and preventing headaches and depression. (3) It moisturizes the throat, preventing coughs and dryness. (4) It cools the heart, spleen, and brain, relieving vexation and irritability. (5) It counteracts the effects of excessive meat consumption, which can lead to poor blood quality. (Westerners always finish their meals with fruit. Formal banquets in our country also include fruit, which reflects the same principle.)</p>
<h3 id="e175">Progress in Reforming Old Operas <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>

<h3 id="e176">Mei Lanfang's "The Assassin" <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The play "The Assassin" originates from the Kunqu opera "The Iron Crown," which tells the story of Lady Fei, a palace woman who endures humiliation and lives in hiding, plotting revenge for her lord and country. It conveys a sense of desperation, as it is no easy task for a weak woman to wield a blade and kill a traitor. This play is a classic of Kunqu opera, and many performers are skilled in it. However, during performances, they often fail to fully express its essence. The play's depth requires careful consideration and effort to bring it to life.</p>
<p>Last year, Mei Lanfang's troupe toured America to great success, as everyone knows. "The Assassin" was considered one of their best performances. Mei meticulously researches each play before performing it, never taking the stage lightly. Critics believed that the original script was already excellent, but further attention to facial expressions and movements could elevate it to a world-class drama. Mei agreed and introduced new ideas to the body language and gestures. Although only one scene is truly central to the play, the emotions are fully conveyed and flawless. He performed it in Beijing upon his return, but I could not attend. Now that he has come to Shanghai, I have had the pleasure of hearing his wonderful performance. Remembering the great reputation he earned abroad, I know it was well deserved.</p>
<p>The value of drama lies first in the significance of its subject matter and second in the appropriateness of its structure. "The Assassin" meets both criteria admirably. Chinese operas are often ancient and difficult to verify, making it difficult to evoke empathy from the audience. "The Assassin," set in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, is relatively recent. The story is based on real events and possesses the spirit of modern drama. Furthermore, China has always been founded on the principles of patriarchal ethics, ritual and teaching virtue. This play, in which a northern woman selflessly risks her life to avenge her country, embodies the spirit of the Eastern nation. The play is a tragedy, naturally performed in a solemn and powerful manner. The structure of the play is concise and focused, preventing the audience from being distracted and allowing them to concentrate. Moreover, Mei Lanfang has carefully revised the play, paying attention to every detail. It is no wonder that the audience is satisfied, and its success is well-deserved. Through this one performance, we can see the excellence of both his voice and his appearance. Moreover, we can explore the progress of reforming old operas. I believe that both modern and traditional drama scholars will study his future performances with even more dedication, not just attending as audience members.</p>

<p>— Sun Wenwei</p>
<p>On a certain day in the month, my cousin Xu Bangda and Ms. Chen Feiyun were married at the Puyi Agency. The witness was Zhao Shuju, a contemporary epigrapher from Siming. The ceremony, which concluded at three o'clock, was excellent. There were many fine works by Shanghai calligraphers and painters displayed, filling the walls and making it difficult to take them all in. Shen Quanqi's collection of poems by Yuan Zhen and Wu Rong, "Butterflies Seeking Flowers on Trees; Do Not Envy Mandarin Ducks in Paintings," was particularly outstanding. Chu Litang's seal inscription collected from Han dynasty mirror inscriptions, "May your life be as long and good as gold and stone; May your descendants be forever joyful," was also impressive. Liu Weilin's lines, "The morning light from the Wu Mountains connects to the emerald peaks; The clear skies of Jade Peak reflect upon the vermilion railings," were beautiful. Wu Hufan and Feng Chaoran jointly presented a couplet, "May you sing together in harmony for a hundred years; May you be blessed with five generations of prosperity." The characters were written by Hufan in the clerical script, larger than bowls, and very magnificent. Huang Xiaoding's small landscape painting, modeled after a corner of Yan Wengui's long scroll, was inscribed with the four characters "Embroidered Mountains and Rivers." Yao Yuqin's meticulously detailed orchid painting in double outline was inscribed, "The good wind blows and releases the flowers blooming in pairs." Ding Yunxuan's small painting of mandarin ducks and hibiscus was inscribed, "Mandarin Ducks Bring Blessings." Fang Jiekang's calligraphy collected inscriptions from Han dynasty "Eight Sons and Nine Grandsons" mirrors. The text is too long to record. Zhao Xuehou's small painting of hibiscus with old and young children was inscribed, "May you enjoy wealth and honor together in old age." Chen Julai's two red and white seal carvings, the white characters reading "Xu" on the side and the red characters reading "Fu Yin," exhibited an ancient seal script style and a deep understanding of the Qin seal tradition. The marriage certificate was in the style of a single page. The first page featured Zhao Shuju's four large seal characters, "Blessings, Prosperity, Mandarin Ducks." The second page contained Chu Litang's clerical script, "On this auspicious day and time, the marriage ceremony is solemn. May you live together for a hundred years and receive endless blessings." The third page featured Feng Chaoran's daylily painting, inscribed with a poem by an ancient person, "Forget-sorrow grass, daughter flower. Relieving anger is not as good as it. It should be planted in the homes of high officials." The fourth page contained the names of the officiant and witnesses, also written by Mr. Litang. It can be said to be a unique marriage certificate. Bangda paints landscapes following Li Zuishi, figures following Yu Difan, and seal script following Zhao Shuju. He comprehends the essence of their art and progresses rapidly. He is a rare talent among the younger generation. His poems, composed without a teacher, are also fresh and readable, revealing his intelligence.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Again, I saw several people gathered around watching. One person was using a needle to pierce people's skin, applying colored paint to the needle and pricking it into the skin to create various designs. This is what is called tattooing. The designs are often in the shape of animals, birds, insects, or reptiles like snakes and centipedes. This is rare in northern China, but it exists in the area south of the Huai River. It is prevalent in Fujian and Guangdong and very common overseas. People who do not wear clothes often consider skin patterns to be beautiful, which has led to a kind of superstition and become a form of social expression. Generally, in China, it is more common among laborers and in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang societies. I don't know about here.</p>
<p>The custom of women piercing their noses and ears is prevalent here, but it seems to be more common among Indian and Burmese people. The ear piercings sometimes create large holes, severely damaging the ears, which is a barbaric custom. Some modern men and women here also cut their hair, while the older generation does not, just like in China.</p>
<p>The houses in Rangoon are not as good as those in Penang and are more old-fashioned. Singapore is magnificent, and Penang is elegant but smaller. Rangoon is even less impressive. This is because Singapore and Penang are newly developed colonies, while Rangoon is an ancient capital. Singapore has 400,000 Chinese residents, while Penang has only one-third of that number. Rangoon has only about ten thousand Chinese residents. The scale of its chambers of commerce and schools is much smaller than those in Singapore and Penang. At night, the Shwedagon Pagoda and the White Pagoda in Rangoon are lit up with electric lights, which are very similar to the Sincere and Wing On Companies in Shanghai. However, the influence of the Buddhist pagodas is significant.</p>
<p>There are many mosquitoes in northern Burma that can cause illness by biting people. In some places, people have died from snake bites. I heard that many people are still injured by snakes in India every year.</p>

<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Diary of a Pilgrimage to Italy</p>
<p>(III) Ten Days in Rome (X) (2)</p>
<p>June 4th - The Grand Cathedral of Saint Peter - The Vatican Palace - The Sistine Chapel -</p>
<p>The Vatican Palace is a world-renowned treasury. It lies to the west of Rome, on the right bank of the Tiber River. The towering Saint Peter's Basilica stands in front. There are numerous strange and magnificent buildings, sculptures, and paintings that move the world. The most famous are the architecture of Saint Peter's Basilica and the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel. Saint Peter was the most famous of Christ's twelve apostles. He accepted Christ's mission and preached Christianity in Rome, ultimately sacrificing himself for God. His remains are buried in Rome. Legend has it that a church was built above Saint Peter's tomb in the second century. In the fourth century, after Emperor Constantine legalized Christianity as the state religion, a more magnificent church was rebuilt over Peter's tomb. The marble used to decorate the interior of the church was transported from Hadrian's Mausoleum.</p>
<p>In 1500, Pope Julius II expanded the sanctuary of Saint Peter's Basilica, commissioning the great architect Bramante to begin the project. Unfortunately, this great work was left unfinished when Bramante died. Later, under Pope Leo X, the project was repaired by the great masters Raphael and Michelangelo. It was finally completed by Bernini after hundreds of years, with designs by numerous masters, resulting in the most magnificent spectacle in architectural history. Now, let me recall our visit to this world's greatest sanctuary.</p>
<p>When the Roman sun was shining brightly on the dry streets, we packed our bags and left the hotel. We took the tram from the sunlit, stone-paved square straight to the Vatican. After about ten minutes, we reached the end of the tram line. As soon as we got off, the view suddenly opened up. A white stone plain stood before us. In the center stood a towering, pointed obelisk, so high it seemed to touch the clouds. On either side stood two large fountains, spewing water dozens of feet into the air like a flood, reflecting the sunlight. We walked happily to the square, surrounded by countless huge stone columns arranged in four rows like a cloister. Suddenly, in the center, a huge dome, four hundred feet high, rose majestically into the sky, shining brilliantly. This was the dome of Saint Peter's Basilica. At that moment, I thought to myself that the person who could conceive of such a strange and magnificent idea must have been the great Michelangelo. Later research confirmed that this was indeed Michelangelo's masterpiece. Filled with a sense of satisfaction and longing, we slowly walked up dozens of stone steps to the main entrance of Saint Peter's Basilica. The front corridor of the entrance has twenty-four columns, arranged in two rows. Each column is one hundred and sixty-five feet high, and its circumference is large enough for fifteen people to encircle. The columns are all made of granite. As we stood between these enormous columns and looked back at the colonnades on both sides, everyone would exclaim in amazement.</p>
<p>Such large columns stand side by side, supporting the stone beams. Above the eaves stand huge stone statues of Christ and his twelve disciples, so imposing and majestic that they seem to boast of the grand spectacle of ancient architecture.</p>

<p>Yesterday, spot transactions of public bonds were still sluggish. The total daily turnover was 20,500 yuan, of which compilation and legacy bonds accounted for 10,000 yuan, and the rest only amounted to several thousand yuan. The futures market was active, mainly because bond prices continued to weaken, and buying interest showed some signs of life. The morning session saw a turnover of over 4.8 million yuan, and the afternoon session reached over 6.3 million yuan, totaling over 11.2 million yuan. The opening trend in the morning was relatively peaceful, but in the second session, large investors suddenly sold off, leading to a sharp decline.

However, buying interest turned more active in the afternoon, and supply and demand were somewhat balanced, with prices slightly rebounding compared to the morning. Except for the fixed price of 19-volume Finance at 62, the rest continued to fluctuate by small amounts ranging from a few cents to six or seven cents.</p>

<p>The yarn market is very weak, with a sharp decline. The overseas cotton yarn market is uniformly trending downwards. The local market was already pessimistic, and under the impact of this trend, it will be even more difficult to sustain. People are increasingly fearful, and there is a sense of rapid decline. The future remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Numerous Bidding Sellers Emerge.  The opening of the bidding market was driven by a sharp drop in American cotton, leading to significant market unease. Sellers flocked to the market, and Jardine Matheson sold unlimited quantities, causing an even steeper decline. The current month fell by 1.29 taels, and the distant months fell by 0.09 taels. It was reported in the afternoon that spot sales were sluggish, and third-grade yarn fell sharply by 3-4 yuan. As a result, market sentiment remained weak, and various months fell by 0.01-0.09 taels. The total daily trading volume was 29,950 bales. Sales included 2,650 bales from Yuda, 2,250 bales from Changfeng, 1,800 bales from Gengfeng, 1,850 bales from Tianlong, 1,600 bales from Dafeng, and 1,000 bales from Tongxing, with the remaining bales ranging from 800-900 bales.

<p>The cotton market's decline intensified slightly due to new lows in American cotton prices. Three-month futures broke through the 0.10 mark, causing significant market unease. However, most buyers remained firm, preventing a major market collapse.</p>
<p>Hankou Cotton Declines by 0.03-0.04 Taels. The opening of the Hankou cotton market was driven by new lows in American cotton prices, leading to slightly weaker market sentiment and declines of 0.01-0.02 taels. In the afternoon, the intermediate months broke through the 0.10 tael mark, but buyer sentiment remained firm, with each declining by 0.01-0.02 taels. The total daily trading volume was 66,200 dan. Sales included 4,200 dan from Yuda, 4,300 dan from Gongtai, 4,000 dan from Yuanda, and 2,800 dan from Tongxing, with the remaining ranging from 2,000-3,000 dan.

<h3 id="e188">Grain and Flour Market Temporarily Trends Sideways <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the various months generally trended sideways. The initial openings for each month were relatively good, but as the quoted prices for foreign wheat fell only slightly, the sentiment outside the industry was inevitably somewhat soft. However, due to the lack of factory sales, the overall trend only felt stagnant. Until the afternoon opening, due to rumors of a rebound in gold coins, the market sentiment for near and far term contracts rebounded slightly. According to speculation within the industry, the current situation can be sustained. If actual sales are smooth or if it triggers purchasing interest from the Northern and Southern groups, this month may improve, which is also unknown. As a result, the current month was down by 0.0025 taels compared to the previous day, January to March were up by 0.0025 taels each, and April and May were unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Wheat Futures Rise Only Slightly <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the various months again showed a firm trend. Although the quoted prices for foreign wheat fell slightly by 0.002-0.004 taels, the sharp contraction of foreign exchange has made the prospect of ordering foreign wheat currently scarce, leading to a firm rise in some people's sentiment. Those who were short-selling were also seen to be timid. In the afternoon, the market sentiment was even tighter due to another sharp rise in the gold market. However, large short-selling firms were still calm on the surface because they still had prepared foreign wheat on order, resulting in only a slight increase. As a result, the current month was up by 0.03 taels compared to the previous day, January was up by 0.01 taels, February was up by 0.02 taels, and March, April, and May were each up by 0.03 taels. The spot wheat market was silent, with only 300 bags of Xianghe wheat opening, with prices down 0.01 taels compared to before.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Arrival and Sales of Ke Xian Rice Are Balanced <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian rice arrived, with a new batch of Hunan rice arriving at the port, and other scattered arrivals. Although no customers from other regions inquired, the local sales were good. The market had no large stockpiles because the rice was sold as soon as it arrived. Therefore, the market was able to stand firm. Yesterday, the Tongshi company handled 224 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice at prices ranging from 11.5 yuan to 11.2 yuan, over 50 bags of Hunan machine-oiled rice at a price of 11.1 yuan, and 842 bags of Hunan machine-Jinggang rice at prices ranging from 11.17 yuan to 10.07 yuan, and 60 bags of Bi-oiled rice at a price of 10 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Sugar Market Soars Again <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange Higher, Tax Increase Imminent</p>
<p>Private Telegram: Java Sugar Expected to Rise by One Guilder</p>
<p>Japanese Sugar Mills Take Advantage, Offer Significant Quantities</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market reports from producing areas: Cuban spot sugar price remained at 1.375, New York sugar futures were at 1.30 for December, 1.43 for March of next year, 1.50 for May, and 1.64 for September. Compared to the previous report, only May fell slightly by 0.01, and other months did not fluctuate. Java spot and futures sugar prices did not rise or fall. The guild drew plates in view of the higher foreign exchange rate, reports of an increase in tariffs to be implemented on January 1, and a private telegram stating that prices in Java were expected to rise by one guilder. Tate &amp; Lyle Sugar also cabled that they would not sell. Market sentiment was tense as a result, and buying interest became more intense. Market prices suddenly soared: Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse white rose 8.4 taels, No. 20 medium white 7.6 taels, No. 18 rose 7.5 taels, No. 8 Dutch red rose 6.925 to 7 taels, and No. 10 rose 7.1 taels, with the market at 7.2 taels in the late afternoon. The market was brisk. Japanese sugar prices also tended sharply upward: N Mark price reached 8.85 taels, YT Mark 8.5 to 8.55 taels, TK Mark 8.7 taels, YRO Mark price from 8.05 to 8.1 taels, and YP Mark price from 9 to 9.05 taels, with the market as high as 9.1 taels in the late afternoon. Transactions were active, and the market was quite firm. Japanese sugar mills took advantage of the situation and offered significant quantities: Meiji Sugar offered 40,000 bags at 4.5 Japanese yen, with higher and lower grades adjusted proportionally. Minghua Sugar offered 10,000 bags at 6 yuan, including tax, all for February delivery. Yanshui Port New Factory also offered December and January delivery, ET and ER marks paired at 4,000 bags, priced at 4.9 Japanese yen. Dazheng Factory offered January and February delivery, AW and AR marks in equal quantities, totaling 5,000 bags priced at 4.75 Japanese yen. The new tax increase made them quite popular. The Haopan factory also opened the Nanyang Factory's ice product factory at the original plate price and market was extremly brisks, and there were already talks of a price increase. In the spot market, Fuka Foreign Firm sold 1,000 bags of medium white sugar at 7.4 taels. The goods were slightly inferior, so the price was more affordable.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Tung Oil Market Shows Strength at the End, Transactions Uniquely Smooth <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the white tung oil market showed strength again. As the end of the year approaches, Chinese merchants will undertake futures sales for export, and market sentiment is slightly firm. However, it is still difficult to improve selling prices. Domestic sales have become exhausted. The end-grade category has had many sources arriving from Hankou, and actual sales are smooth. Zhongxiu Wanfengyu brand sold at 23 taels, Weixiu Gaopai at 19.2 taels, and Luhuo retail at 19 taels. Currently, the end-grade category in this city has complex brands, and most of them are counterfeit goods.</p>

<p>English white iron, regardless of color, has recently been trending very smoothly. Prices are rising steadily due to supply shortages. Currently, 22-gauge sells for up to 13.55 taels per dan, 24-gauge for 14 taels, 26-gauge for 15.75 taels, 28-gauge for 15.95 taels, and 48 sheets for 16.75 taels, 0.5-0.6 taels higher than the previous market. Export groups, such as those from inland and along the Yangtze River, are still seeking to deliver goods, but the northern groups have little trading due to the approaching New Year. The local construction group has the strongest appetite, with an estimated 300-400 bundles being opened in the past two or three days. The circulation of goods is increasingly scarce, so market sentiment is solid. The future standard has a good chance of continuing to improve.</p>

<p>This year, silkworm production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has been poor, and fresh cocoon prices are high. Villagers in various areas sell cocoons instead of reeling silk, resulting in a shortage of raw silk materials needed by silk weaving factories. In addition, raw silk prices are gradually rising, and silk merchants are purchasing double palace silk. Recently, spring silk weaving has begun, and the demand for raw materials is high. Sales of double palace silk are brisk. The six double palace silk factories in the Shanghai area are almost unable to meet demand. Silk prices are gradually rising, with high-quality double palace silk initially rising from 420 taels to 480 taels, and now rising another 10 taels. The market is quite brisk.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market in this city remained quiet. The sales of Zhenmei green tea from both Lu Zhuang and Tu Zhuang were increasingly sluggish. Although the American Zhuang have a few stomach intake of Xia Mu Zhu tea, market trading remained low. Transactions of Zhen Mei and Xiu Mei teas have also become more sluggish. British and French merchants are generally tightening their belts due to the impending year end and weak overseas sales. The tea market trend seems in a tailspin.</p>

<h3 id="e197">After Viewing the Shanghai Art College Painting Exhibition <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Lou Jinsheng</p>
<p>In these past three months, there have been two or three painting exhibitions in a row, which is very gratifying. Recently, the Shanghai Art College on Jiangwan Road in Zhabei held another painting exhibition, which opened on the 11th of this month. On display were student works, faculty works, and works by Japanese artists, totaling eight hundred and several tens of pieces. President Wang Daoyuan is said to have studied at the Tokyo Art School in Japan for many years. The professors, such as Chen Baoyi, Zhu Yingpeng, and Ni Yide, are all well-known artists. The addition of works by Japanese artists to the exhibition makes it very worthwhile to see.</p>
<p>I rushed there at nine o'clock on the morning of the 11th. At that time, everything was not yet fully arranged, but the paintings were all hung up, so I was not disappointed. Among the works, Chen Baoyi's landscapes still have the same style and taste. He still likes to use green and rough brushstrokes. One small landscape is very well painted. The light and colors of the water and mountains in the painting are extraordinarily shocking and complex, but he handles them very well, still using a relaxed and light brushstroke. I feel that the author is worthy of admiration. Secondly, Ni Yide's paintings have undergone a major change in style. He uses large brushstrokes and simple colors. "Eating Utensils" is the best piece. Recently, I often talk to friends about how the most difficult time for a painter is after more than ten years of white study. When a person reaches this time, there is little progress. Looking at our current art scene, there are the most of these people, which is very sad, because he has been bound by what he has learned himself. Therefore, I think it is a good idea for Ni Yide to change his style.</p>
<p>Regarding Wang Daoyuan's works, his method of expression is very unique. One portrait of a Japanese woman has extremely beautiful brushwork. A portrait of a Chinese woman has an outstanding way of painting the woman's face. However, I feel that the painting sometimes lacks cleanliness, but the painting "On the Road to Lingyin" rarely has this problem. Zhu Yingpeng's "Earth Mother" has a different kind of interest. The face of the Earth Mother is painted very movingly.</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese painters, there is a "Nude Woman" and "Suzhou River Wharf," the author's name has been forgotten. "Nude Woman" shows the ambiguity in the painting studio, and "Suzhou River Wharf" uses a gloomy tone and a very novel method of expression.</p>
<p>After seeing the exhibition, I thought about all kinds of things. I feel that there are too few writings on painting now, it is really too lonely. Therefore, despite my own shallowness, I wrote this article.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Japanese Imperial Art Exhibition of Western Paintings Tour (2) <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Haiyan</p>
<p>Japan Correspondence</p>
<p>The stone steps and the plaza in front of the Tokyo Prefectural Art Museum were already crowded with people. Besides a large number of male visitors, there were also two or three groups of female students and elementary school children. Someone who hadn't seen this before would surely find it amusing, thinking, "What do children know? Yet they happily come to art exhibitions like this." Actually, in Japan, where art education is widespread, this is not an unusual sight. Whether walking on the street, in a park, by the seaside, or in the countryside, one can always find two or three children standing, squatting, or sitting, one hand holding a brush, the other holding a drawing board, applying reds and greens as they sketch from nature. Some of them paint quite well, displaying a pure and innocent expression, and they also understand a little about art principles, the relationship between light and color, and the principles of perspective. One day, I went for a stroll in Hibiya Park and happened to look up to see a large crowd forming a semi-circular human screen, intently appreciating a student who appeared to be from an art school, depicting the towering Public Hall.</p>
<p>"......The painting is not bad, but the color and tone... what do you think?"</p>
<p>"That's right, he probably didn't pay attention to the atmosphere..." Two not-so-small elementary school students emerged from the crowd and made this incisive criticism on their way home, which left me stunned. Anything can happen; even children know what is called 'tone' and what is called 'atmosphere'! This happened in February of this year, and the impression it left on me is still vivid in my memory.</p>
<p>In Ueno, the art capital of Japan, exhibitions by various art groups, large and small, are regularly held, month after month, without fail. From the opening day to the closing day, there is not a single exhibition that is not filled with small visitors of this kind. They diligently hold a small booklet of exhibit titles and a small pencil, starting from the first room in the exhibition hall, appreciating each painting with an open mind and in silence. When they find a painting they like and find beautiful, they mark it with a circle on the catalog. If they like it even more, they draw several circles in a row. Conversely, for paintings they deem bad or unattractive, paintings they dislike, they mark an "X" next to the item’s name and the artist’s name to express their dissatisfaction. Older children not only draw circles or "X" marks but also jot down a few comments next to the entry in the catalog, expressing their opinions on the painting. Their method of appreciation is also very skillful. They know to move forward to study the brushstrokes and color harmony in detail, and they also know to step back to view the overall structure and the totality of colors in the entire painting. Sometimes moving forward, sometimes stepping back, sometimes closing one eye, sometimes making a telescope shape with their hands, they do their utmost in the art of appreciation. From this, we can see a glimpse of the aesthetic sense of the Japanese people.</p>
<p>However, I do not like to view paintings in a room with children, especially groups of children. If they are with companions, they are extremely noisy and prone to bumping and barging about. Fortunately, although I coincidentally encountered these groups of elementary school students pouring into the entrance at the same time today, they all turned left, heading first to the first section, the Japanese painting exhibition hall. We, on the other hand, began with the second section on the right, the Western painting exhibition.</p>
<p>Upon entering the room, one cannot help but feel a gloomy and dense atmosphere, as if entering a dark cave where it is impossible to find a source of light. To put it plainly, the current Imperial Exhibition has reached the extreme of vulgarity and corruption. The artists of the Imperial Exhibition, because they want to enjoy the benefits of being given all favorable treatment by the government-sponsored exhibition, devote all their efforts to surface embellishment, using it to attract the worship of ordinary people – outsiders – and further consolidate the foundation of the fortress they have built up over the years. This absurd mistake has resulted in these two self-digging, tomb-creating disasters:</p>
<p>1.  The hardening of thought, and</p>
<p>2.  The vulgarization of technique.</p>
<p>The Imperial Exhibition – even its predecessor, the Ministry of Education Fine Arts Exhibition (文展), which is the fine arts exhibition of the Ministry of Education – was founded in the late Meiji era, in the fortieth year [of Meiji, 1907]. In the eighth year of the Taisho era [1919], under the tide of ardent reform arguments, the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts was established, and the Ministry of Education exhibition (文展) was renamed the Imperial Exhibition (帝展). Since its inception, it has had a long history of over twenty years. However, the anti-traditional school of thought at the time of its founding was discriminatory toward artistic styles after Impressionism. Works that were not in the style of academic realism could rarely, almost absolutely never, be selected. Later, new and upcoming artists did not approve of the examiners' judgment, and as a result, the revolutionary Nikakai was established. They rallied like-minded individuals, raised the flag of "anti-government exhibition," and broke away from the stagnant, dogmatic, and non-individualistic fetters of the Western painting world of the past, embarking on a path of true, interesting, free, and individually enlightened art.</p>
<p>Midway through – in the early days of the Imperial Exhibition – although gradually succumbing to the times, it changed its examination policy. Works that could not pass selection during the Ministry of Education exhibition were also selectively adopted, giving the Nikakai a victory of foresight. However, the position of not adopting the most radical schools of painting, such as Cubism, Futurism, Constructivism, Expressionism, and Surrealism, is still adhered to to this day. Originally, since government endeavors cannot be more radical than general endeavors, there is probably an unavoidable reason for this. But if it is too far from the times, I believe it is not appropriate. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e200">Great China University Student Social Gathering <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Held Tonight at 7 PM</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow. This semester has passed by quickly and busily. Generally, the passionate and youthful students, immersed in the mechanical school life, naturally feel mentally bored. Therefore, the pursuit of love and the moans of literature and art are their expressions. However, this is not universal and cannot be enjoyed by everyone. Therefore, students from various schools, in order to remedy the shortcomings of this peculiar paradise and to seek common warmth and connect with the feelings of the masses, are holding social gatherings. Especially as the end of the semester approaches, who doesn't feel the dryness of the taste of books over the past few months? Therefore, the variety shows of various schools have been held one after another. It is known that the social gathering of students from Great China University is scheduled to be held in the auditorium of the university at 7 PM on the 13th of this month. The Chinese Harmonica Team, the Shanghai National Martial Arts Hall, and the Plum Blossom Girls' Dance Troupe have been invited to perform. It is heard that Xu Zexiang and others in charge of the gathering are quite busy with preparations. It is expected that there will be a grand scene at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e201">A Night's Talk on the Question of After Graduation <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>The evening was dim, and the north wind was blowing fiercely in the sky. The figures in the dining hall were sparse. Only a few dozen of us occupied about ten tables eating dinner. This was because today was Saturday. Those who had families in Shanghai or places to go had already gone out. So only a few dozen of us were scattered about having dinner.</p>
<p>After the meal, I felt even more bored. The four people in my room had gone out and hadn't returned yet. They had families in Shanghai, so they probably wouldn't be back tonight. There were two others left, but they were classmates from junior high school, and I couldn't really talk to them about anything. It was really stifling. Boredom filled my heart with all sorts of thoughts, making me extremely sad. I wanted to suppress these mixed thoughts, but the more I tried to suppress them, the more mixed thoughts arose. I had no way to deal with it, so I quietly strolled to a classroom where there wasn't a single soul. But not a moment later, Miss Zhou, Miss Li, and Miss Lin from my class suddenly came in. They pushed the door open with laughter. I couldn't help but be startled by them.</p>
<p>"Miss Wang, you're so leisurely, hiding here all alone. What are you thinking about? Are you thinking about him?" Miss Li saw me and asked with a mischievous grin. Then Miss Zhou said,</p>
<p>"You made us search so hard! We went to your fancy room and found it empty. So you're here, thinking about what?"</p>
<p>"Thinking about what? Are you making fun of me too? What is there on my mind that I can't tell you? Isn't it what we talked about yesterday?"</p>
<p>"What did you talk about yesterday? I didn't! You were talking about something without letting me know!" Miss Lin said, pouting like a child.</p>
<p>"Miss Lin is always like a child, having another childish outburst. Where did you run off to? We looked for you there," Miss Li said, arguing with her.</p>
<p>"Forget it, let me tell you. Yesterday evening, when Miss Li and I were walking in the campus, we suddenly ran into Miss Zhou and Miss Bu, who were also walking in the campus. The four of us formed a group, and we sat in the campus and discussed. It was mainly about our future. Talking about the future is really a headache, making us unable to start. We talked for an hour or two yesterday, but we didn't come to any conclusions. We started talking about the nearest future, but that is a terrible future. We are all about to graduate from senior high school teacher training, so the problem of our nearest future is naturally the problem of after graduation. What a difficult problem this is!"</p>
<p>"Yes, my family, to put it bluntly, is certainly a well-to-do family, but because there are too many people in the family, my hope of going to college will probably become a despair. It's not that I don't want to pursue higher education, but the environment is forcing me. I am going to fall behind, and I'm sorry if I will disappoint you. Perhaps my heart still doesn't want to fall behind. Although I don't have the qualification to enjoy formal college education, no one can stop me from studying advanced knowledge in practice," Miss Lin said to this point, her eyes already turning red, seeming about to shed tears. Then Miss Zhou also excitedly said,</p>
<p>"Miss Lin, we are both in the same boat. I also can't go to college. The reason is none other than being controlled by the environment. That's why I often can't go on when I talk to you about these things. It's not that I want to keep my family circumstances a secret, but I really don't have the courage to say it. Now that you've all talked about these things, let me also speak my mind. In terms of my environment, first, my family is not very wealthy, and second, my parents don't believe in girls studying, so from the time I graduated from elementary school until now, I have relied on my own strong will and worked hard to win my parents' consent. However, in these few years, my parents have repeatedly said to me, 'Qin'er,</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>your neighbors are getting old and are eager for you to get married, and hope that you can understand the hearts of the two elders, and don't be so determined to keep going to school.' My reply is, 'Dad, Mom, please don't say these words. I know my own life, and I will always obey you, so please rest assured.' So after graduating from senior high school teacher training this time, I can't continue to go against their wishes. I know that even if I continue to argue, I'm afraid I won't be successful. It's better to temporarily end my studies. At the same time, to take care of economic problems, I want to work for a year before deciding. But whether I can find a way to continue my studies after that is naturally a problem."</p>
<p>As they talked to this point, the hot tears that filled each of their eyes fell like beads from a broken string at the same time. All that could be heard was sobbing. There was some silence in between, and it's hard to describe what the scene was like. They left the classroom together in sadness.</p>
<p>Alas, I wonder how many young people are out of school. Judging from the proportion of us few people, it's really alarming! Just a few minutes ago, how could I have known that none of us few had hope of going to college? Is this fate controlling us, or is it the inherited social system that is bullying us? And what attitude should we take?</p>
<p>I wonder how many young men and women are troubled by disappointment, sad because of trouble, and moving towards the path of negativity because of sadness. This has created the arrogance of youth. But should we be like this? No, the youth of the times should never be like this! We should resist the destructive force of the environment's potential. We should work even harder in disappointment to achieve our future goals. I think a bright future is definitely waiting for us. If we are willing to work hard with determination and double our efforts, temporary disappointment can never prevent our great success in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Writing to Bao Jun (continued) <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Bishui</p>
<p>Alas, Bao Jun, is this really seeking one's own death? I am unwilling to say this, I am unwilling to say this! If I work hard at selling manuscripts, it's not impossible to make a living. But, Bao Jun, the current me has neither fame, nor money, nor a woman. Who would be willing to rely on selling articles to make a living?</p>
<p>Alas, Bao Jun, just talking about it makes me want to shed tears again. I have already told you before that I only have one bamboo cloth long gown to wear. Besides this, I have no second set of clothes to change into. But that Miss, she (I don't know her surname and name, but her family lives at 161 XX Road. Let's use 161 to represent her for now), I meet her in the French Park every day, and she changes into a different outfit every day.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, Bao Jun, there is probably no sadness in the world greater than this. I am really seeking my own troubles. Both of us are in tune with each other, but why can't I directly go to her and express my love? I would feel satisfied only when I’m sitting in her arms. It doesn’t matter even if I kneel at her feet, but why can’t I do this?</p>
<p>Oh, I understand, Bao Jun. It's not that I don't have the courage to do it, but social forces don't allow me to do it, and economic conditions don't allow me to do it. It's pitiful to be in this old society, and I'm also a poor scholar. Like this, I am not qualified to love the person I want to love.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, Bao Jun, I remember, you once said to me that you thought the prerequisite for love was that the problem of life should be solved first, otherwise it would just be empty talk. If one is hungry oneself, then one cannot blame anyone. If one marries a woman, and she also goes hungry with oneself, then the woman has not committed any sin. One cannot harm her. Continued on the ninth page</p>
<h2>Page 27</h2>
<p>Then, the woman has no fault at all, and I cannot harm her.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, thinking of these words makes me feel sad again. Pitiful me, lately I can't even eat a meal. Sometimes there isn't even a drop of water to drink in a day. Like this, I cannot solve my own life problems. I don’t have the ability to maintain myself. And she, she, Bao Jun, I have already told you before, her family has three or four servants. Their servants don't even go hungry. It's pitiful that my life is not as comfortable as the servants in her family. How can I dare to love her?</p>
<p>Alas, alas, I am ashamed to death, Bao Jun. I was wrongly born a man. But when I think of my current situation, my tears are less valuable than a woman's, dripping down and wetting my blue shirt.</p>
<p>Alas, Bao Jun, I don't know if it was intentional or unintentional, but she, who lives at 161 XX Road, one day in the French Park, seeing me following her, deliberately dropped her silk handkerchief on the grass. Later, I ran over to pick it up, and saw the three letters S.C.M. embroidered on it. I don't know if she deliberately left it for me. But me, Bao Jun, pitifully, my handkerchief is just a silk gauze product, bought from the Sanyou Industrial Company, one dime a piece. I want to return the favor, but I'm embarrassed to take it out.</p>

<p>Several times I wanted to launch a fierce attack on her, to start a conversation with her first. But I am a coward, I am a content person. Before I even opened my mouth to speak to her, my heart would jump nervously, and redness would instantly appear on my cheeks. At this time, I was so ashamed that there was no place for me to hide. How could I have the courage to open my mouth to speak to her like this?</p>
<p>Once, there was a very good opportunity. She and I ran into each other on the road. She even glanced at me several times, looking me up and down, seeming like she wanted to talk to me (I don't dare say that she was prepared to talk to me, so I use the words "seeming like"). A person with courage would have already stepped forward to greet her. But me, Bao Jun, I am a coward after all. Pitifully, at this time, I could only scurry away like a rabbit. I didn't dare to boldly step forward and greet her shamelessly. This was really missing a good opportunity. I really missed a good opportunity.</p>
<p>Since that time, when I go to the French Park, I no longer see her beautiful figure. Alas, has she abandoned me? Or is she complaining that I am too cowardly? Or else, is she sick? ...... Pitiful me, I can't directly run to 161 XX Road and ask her in person why she doesn't come to the French Park. I have no way of knowing. At this time, I am really in extreme pain.</p>
<p>Alas, according to reason, getting sick doesn't seem to be so coincidental. Abandoning me, I haven't even spoken to her, let alone offended her. Of course, she wouldn't abandon me for no reason. I understand, Bao Jun, she must be complaining that I am too cowardly. She must be complaining that I am too cowardly...</p>
<p>But although she doesn't go to the French Park anymore, I still have a chance to meet her every day when I walk past the door of 161 XX Road, as long as she is at home. But, Bao Jun, this is another very awkward thing. When I walk past the door of her house, if she sees me, she always tries to avoid me. But after I pass the door of her house, she stands at the door again to look at me. If I turn back to look at her and our eyes meet, then she, like me, has both cheeks flushed red. From this point of observation, I am able to be sure that she has my impression in her mind. (To be continued)</p>
