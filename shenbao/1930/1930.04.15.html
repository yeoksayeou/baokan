<p>時評</p>
<h3>日議會之準備</h3>
<p>此次日本議會。政府黨得議員之大多數。以視前次政友會之田中内閣。宜若鞏固矣。然於國會議員之席數雖多。而於貴族院之感情則劣。故轉不若田中内閣可以殘延長久之時日。此乃日本政治歷史之關係。與純粹之會議制。略有不同者也。</p>
<p>歷來日本政府之摇動。往往不在議會中重要問題。而在一二細故。爲元老貴族所反對。遂至無可挽救。至於傾覆。即以最近之田中内閣而論。亦復发此。其初雖經院中之彈劾。院外之反對。而安若泰山。其後諸大問題悉以解决。乃反一蹶而即倒。故此次濱口内閣之前途。亦未必能反此例。此次濱口内閣之難關。表面爲失業問題。而暗中之主要。或者爲軍縮問題。蓋倫敦海會之對英美讓步之回訓。元老與貴族。多不滿意而反對之也。蓋元老與貴族。多軍閣中人。現雖爲外交體面故。不能翻覆。基結果。必歸罪於内閣處置之不善。而使内閣不安於其位亦意中事也。</p>

<p>國是否能夠統一、是否能實行統治權、也就在此一舉、因爲一國的力量、就寄於一國的統治權、今閻錫山等擅行作亂、就是破壞統治權、就是破壞中華民族的基礎、便成爲一個割據的形式、一個國家成了割據的形式　以後要想在國際上得到平等的地位、是萬不可能的、所以現在閻錫山等這種行動、實在有置中華民族於死地的危險、我們如果不用全力去消滅他們、就不足以謀自已的生存、至於戡亂的辦法、中央當然已有準備、現在僅就應用何種根本辦法來使我們的國家逐漸健全、國家的權力日趨强大、當然仍須以建設爲根本、我以爲建設的目標、應在增進一般普通人的幸福、增加一般普通人的能力、使一般普通人都能得到快樂、而欲逹此目的的道路有三、（一）便利運輸、可增加生産能力、故必即實行修治道路、疏濬河流、（二）增進一般普通人之常識、就是要實行普及敎育、務必使從事某種事業者、對於其本身事業、有專門之知識和技能、如中國自古以農立國、而農業生産額、較之美國膛乎其後者、在美國農民充分常識、對農業上均有相當之專門知識和技能、故中美種棉地畝相等、而美産棉額較我産棉額常超過三四倍、以一反三、可知欲建設之成功、非從普及敎育始不可、（三）提倡國民體育、須知必先有强健之身體、才有强健之精神、有强健之精神、然後有强健之事業、故一國國民身體之健全與否、常影響於民族之强弱、所以從建設根本上着想、必先努力於上列三者、然後建設之功易成、在國際上亦易得到平等地位云云、報告畢散會、　　▲國民政府　同日上午十時、國民政府舉行總理紀念週、到蔣中正·譚延闓·孫科·朱培德·古應芬·邵元冲·易培基·陳儀·魏道明·張難先·蔣夢麟·劉瑞桓·周亞衛·李錦綸·張我華、及文官參軍兩處職員三百餘人、蔣中正主席、行禮後、由秘書錢昌照作政治報告如下、（一）五國海軍會議、開幕已久、會議的幾個難關、兄弟於該會議開幕以前、曾經詳細講過、現在難關未見穏渡、而各國鈎心鬥角缺乏誠意、却是狠明的暴露出來前幾星期會議的形勢險惡、有破裂的可能、後來日本政府接受美國的巡洋艦及濳水艇噸位提議、雖然附加若干保留、但是英美日三國間空氣、因此和緩不少、而三國協定、已經可以成立、有人説日本受着壓迫交涉失敗了、兄弟以爲這還是日本聰明之處、此次會議、英美自爲中心、這兩國向來是最顧體面的、要是會議完全失敗、那末、對於日法意一定是非常僨激、而英美結合、勢必益見鞏固、法意利害在大陸者居多、日本爲海洋國、將來難免處處受牽制、其接受美國提議正欲買好於英國、而爲將來海上留活動地步、日本政府、能屈能伸、於此可見、照目前情形觀察、海軍會議、决不會完全失敗、而英美當局的表示、又是非常積極、至于法意兩國、始終不肯讓步、一方面因爲他們暫時没有遷就英美的必要、一方面因爲英美對於他們的妥協、也未必十分重視、結果究竟爲五國恊定、或僅爲三國恊定、就看這幾天的接洽、（二）閣馮不知有民、不知有國、其消滅當然是很快、現在中央所顧慮的、不在戰事而爲民間、連年天災人禍、元氣損失殆盡、此次閣馮叛變、民間直接間接又將受有影響、於中央平定叛變之前、在短時間中、民間祇得暫時忍着痛苦、待到封建軍閥滅、中央可以專心建設、民間元氣方可逐漸恢復、至於討逆軍隧所至、自應處處本愛護人民之心、作捍衛人民之事、此點蔣士書中、已經詳述、而大局平定以後、中央惟一最重要的工作、即爲减輕人民的負担與痛苦、（三）全國運動大會、已於前日閉幕、此次大會精神極好、成績亦屬可觀、不過環顧我國民族、仍是萎靡不振、普通一般人、少壯時期、精神已是不甚充足、年未五十、便有衰老之象、六十以上、大半退休、較之歐美各國實在是慚愧、前幾天美報載美國大理院法官之年齡及照相、其中年齡最長者爲八十九歲、最少者爲五十八歲而皆精神抖擻、毫無衰老之象、眞可羡慕、現在我國民族、要想振作、第一應該鍛鍊體格、而鍜鍊體格、要普遍又要有恒心、我國自從第一次遠東運動會以來、關於鍛鍊體格、有兩種缺點、一種就是不普遍、運動差不多限於學界、農工商界、很少加入、原因是農工商界對於運動、不甚發生興趣、而社會上又没有設備給他們練習的機會、一種就是無恒、往一曝十寒、所以成績不見進步、近年來與日本菲列濱比賽、屢屢落後、原因是運動員自已不大努力、同時社會上對於運動會、也是漸漸冷淡、以上兩種缺點、須得想法補救、此事關係民族的發揚甚大、運動除鍜鍊體格之外、更能養成公平角逐光明磊落的精神、眞的運動家、不僅僅有技術、抑且有修養、而這種修養、要是移到社會上、也可以造就極好的風氣、運動的重要如此、政府爲提倡起見、决定明年全國運動會在首都舉行、經費爲五十萬元、並指定林森朱培德何應欽吳鐵城魏道明五位爲籌備委員、（四）德國實業視察團、即將來京、該團共有八人、爲德國實業界的代表、他們對於各種實業、學識經騐、很稱豊富、其中有兩位對於我國情形、也甚明瞭、他們這回來是具有誠意的、不经普通的視察團赴幾次宴會、講幾句不着邊際的話、就算了事、他們旣然具有誠意、我們應該特别歡迎并有三個希望、在他們視察以前、我們極願意一聆他們十年來以堅忍沈毅的精神、在艱難困苦中奮鬥的經過、因爲那種精神是値得效法的、那種經過、可以做我們的榜樣、這是第一個希望、在他們視察的時候、我們更願意聽他們的批評、儘量的批評、要曉得我國一切實業、都是幼稚、惟其是幼稚、在打基礎的期間、更應該愼重、倘或走差了路、往往毫厘千里、所以此刻他們要是儘量批評、關係我國實業前途是很大的、這是第二個希望、他們視察以後、回到德國、那時對候對於我國實業情形、一定是愈加清楚、對於我國政府及人民、一定是愈加了解、將來有機會、兩國間可以於完全平等之下謀互助、這是第三個希望、以他們這回來的誠意、决不會敎我們失望的、同時我們應該給他們種種便利、種種機會、去視察與接洽、</p>

<p>我國人口、據最近調查、約四萬三千餘萬、而不識字的民衆、則占百分之八十、約三萬萬餘萬人、就中除去應受義務敎育的學齡兒童、及六歲以下的孩童各四千餘萬、五十歲以上老年人五千餘萬、盲聾啞殘廢人及有精神病神經病者約百萬人外、其餘尙有二萬萬餘萬人、約占全數之半、皆是靑年及成年、此項靑年及成年、都是國家的健全份子、社會中的中堅人物、在這個訓政期内、要訓練這般大多數不識不知的民衆們、明瞭黨義、蓮用四權、具備國民常識和生活技能、那末除了積極的施以補習敎育外、眞是其道莫由了、</p>
<p>因此、民國十八年六月、第三届中央執行委員會第一次全體會議、討論整頓與發展全國敎育案便議决了下列兩案、（一）「厲行國民義務敎育及成年補習敎育、其計劃及規程與實施程序、限於十八年九月底、由敎育部制定、經中央執行委員决議後、積極辦理、其全部計劃、限於民國二十三年底實現（二）「關於整頓並發展敎育之設施、政府應即於十九年春季由敎育部召集全國敎育會議、在會議未召集前、敎育部應即組織敎育方案編製委員會、根據本黨政網、及歷届代表大會、中央全體會議、常務會議等、關於敎育之决議案、參照十七年大學院召集之全會敎育會議之議案等、製成實行整頓並發展全國敎育之方案、此方案必須包含整個敎育經費之預算、敎育方案編製委員會之組織、由中央政治會議决定、限於十八年七月内成立開始工作」、</p>
<p>敎育部於十八年七月間、奉到此令後、即於八月間聘請了五十餘位敎育專家爲委員成立敎育方案編製委員會、分組討論、其被聘爲成年補習敎習組專門委員者、爲孟憲承·陳劍翛·鍾靈秀·顧樹森·俞慶棠·趙冕·江恒源等七人、以孟憲承爲·主任、但是本組委員、雖經聘定、则各以事牽、不易集合開會討論、又因成年補習敎育、係隸屬社會敎育司第一科職堂範圍、余承乏科務、所以首先擬定本案大網如下、（一）大網説明、（二）應受成年補習敎育人數的估計、（三）補習學校的種類、（四）校舍和設備、（五）師資的培養、（六）經費的負担和籌掯的方法、（七）實行强迫成年補習敎育時期、及分年實施的程序、擬畢、送請社會敎育司陳司長劍翛審定、即由余與顧君良杰陳劍翛司長三人、分别擔任起草、九月間次第脱稿、油印數十份分送成年補習敎育各專門委員、徴求意見、閲時一月、先後送到補充意見者、計有孟憲承·江恒源·趙冕·陶知行諸先生、十一月五日、提交敎育方案編製委員會第二次常會討論、當經决議本方案分兩步進行（一）國民識字訓練、（二）職業訓練、並議决請原起草人陳司長及余、與朱經農·陶知行·顧樹森先生等五人、於十一月六日上午、會同審查、當將陶先生提出的公民識字訓練原則、斟酌修正職業訓練大網、則由顧樹森先生擬定、於同日午提交第三次常會討論、當將兩項原則、分别修正、交原起草人陳司長與余、採取各人意見、會同整理、十二月底稿成送請蔣部長核閲、蔣部長以需費太多、國家財力、恐難負担、因改定在訓政六年之内、先將國民識字訓練、切實作到、職業訓綀、則俟識字訓練施行後、再行繼續舉辦、如此分兩步進行、國家財力、較易負担、因此原案標題改定爲「實施成年補習敎育初步計晝」其内容分爲七項、（一）原則（二）目前急切的問題、（三）失學成年人入學補習及培養師資辦法（四）增加校舍設備的辦法、（五）經費預算及其籌措方法、（六）編輯國民識字敎材辦法、（七）實施普及的手續、（八）預定的强迫時期及强迫後之考核、上稿於一月中旬、修正完畢、印刷數十份、由敎育部送呈行政院轉呈國民政府轉送中央政治會議審核、此係本方案第二次脱稿及呈送中央審核的經過情形、</p>
<p>但是呈送中央審核、業已兩月、尙未得其發還、現距全國敎育會議開會的期間不遠、當於呈送整個改進敎育方案時　並將本案、一併列入、以期定整、對於原稿亦略有增删、此又本方案與其他全部敎育方案、再度呈送中央審核的經過、此外第二步職業訓練部分　雖擬俟第一部識字訓練完成後、再行實施、但是遇有地方財力人力可以同時舉辦、和有此地方有需要情形、即可繼續舉辦的、自然可以並行不悖、或陸續舉辦、所以職業訓綀計劃、當然也要擬定、因此、擬定之後、便歸入於改進社會敎育方案計劃第二項裏面、以便全國敎育會議開會時、得以盡量討論以期完善這也是要附帶説明的、</p>
<p>談到本方案計劃内容、簡括言之、可以分爲兩大部分、（一）國民識字訓練（二）職業訓練、前者、如果按照計劃施行、則於六年之内、可將全國成年文盲、一律救護出來、眞是可以逹到人人能够識字讀書看報寫信算數記賬的目的·後者如果也繼續按照計劃實行、則農·工·婦女·各别的、亨受職業訓練、自然够轉充他們在生居上和職業上許多必需的知識技能·並且增加他們的各種生産能力總而言之、此案完全實行、的的確確、可以充實人民生活扶植社會生存、發展國民生計、延續民族生命、逹到民族獨立、经權普遍民生發展、以促進世界大同目的、但是計劃不完備的地方仍然很多、而補充改正的責任、當然屬望於此次全國敎育會議各會員了、</p>
<p>茲因全國敎育會議今日開會、申報館有敎育特刋發行、謹述本案起草的經過情形及其要點如此以實籌幅、藉答所馲</p>
<h3>第二次會議和後一次會議的比較吳研因</h3>
<p>這一次全敎會議的綠起組織··以及提案和十七年五月前大	學院所召集的全敎會議有甚麽不同之點第一次全敎會議的决議、現在已實行了多少、未實行的、現在提案中是否列人、兩次提安内容的詳略互異之點又何如··這都是敎育界所欲急切知道的問題、現在我想把這些問題、約略的説一説、</p>
<h3>（一）緣起</h3>
<p>第一次會議、召集在南京國民政府成立不久的時候、那時三民主義敎育正待實施敎育行政尙未統一、··大學院長蔡子民先生和許多大學委員、以爲有開全敎會議的必要、所以第一次會議的召集、是由大學院方面發起的、這一次會議根據二中全會的决議召集、是由中央發起的··中央以爲在訓政時期、以敎育爲重、應該召集會議、徴集全國敎育界的意見、完全整個的敎育方案和全部的敎育預算、所以就緣起而讑、兩次會議、各有各的需要、各有各的用意、實在是不相同的、</p>
<h3>（二）組織</h3>
<p>第一次會議、會員由各省各出二人、各特别市各出一人各政府機關各選派一人、此外有專家會員十八人、大學院院長、副院長、秘書長、以及各處處長、參事共十人、還有大學委員會列席的七八人、總數凡七八十人、這次、省、特别市和政府各機關都有增設的、所以分之、定額雖和前次相同、合之、總數已增加了不少、專家會員、也比前次增加十二人、敎部部長、次長、司長、參事、和前次差不多、而國立大學校長則代大學委員改列席爲出席、所以全體會員總人數共有一百三十三人之多、還有顯然汪同的、前次會員多數是學術專家和大學敎授、初等敎育界、華僑敎育界、蒙藏敎育界、都未與聞、這次則除有三四個初等敎育專家之外、並且每省各有一個主持初等敎育行政的市縣敎育局長或市縣政敎育科長、華僑敎育專家和蒙藏敎育專家、也有了幾個、會期則前次爲十日、這次爲七日、</p>
<h3>（三）籌備</h3>
<p>籌備委員會的組織前後兩次、大槪相同、但有幾點不同的、（一）則前次籌備員人數較少、其中少數人負擔太重、此次人數較多、而且合則有聯合辦事處、分則各有專責、不致所擔的事務、有偏輕偏重之弊、（二）則籌備的較爲完密、凡招待。編輯文書·事務等事、事前來得及預備的、都事前預備好、這是自然的結果、因爲這是第二次、有許多人籌備過第一次會議、已有不少的經騐了、不過時期急促、仍有許多事、未能從容辦理、而且會員招待處、距離大會場太遠、不容易照顧週到］、這是不及第一次會議之處、</p>
<h3>（四）提案</h3>
<p>兩次提案不同之點最多、這是最値得比較的、現在且把提案較重要的不同之點、失大體分述於下、</p>
<h3>（一）由來不同</h3>
<p>上次提案、雖　也先成六提案委員會、事前預備、但是除提案委員會所備案的提案之外、還有各敎育機關自由提出的議案、各會員和敎育界人員個人提出的議案、就是提案委員會所預備的、也大半用委員個人的名義提出、這次的提案、由敎育部成立全國敎育方案編製委員會、根據中華民國敎育宗旨及其實施方鍼、以及中央歷次關於敎育的决議和上次全國敎育會議的决議編製、呈請中央政治會議審查核定、提出時、完全不用個人名義、各敎育機關和各敎育界的個人、也没有另提議案的可以、所以上次的提案、是産生於敎育界上各個人的自由思想的、這次的提案、是中央製定、産生於政府的統一意旨的、</p>
<h3>（二）方式不同</h3>
<p>因爲由來不同的緣故、所、</p>
<p>以上次的提案是片段的駮雜的、這次提案、是整個的、純粹的、上次各提各的案、所以意見非常的紛歧、有相重複的也有相衝突的、有太詳的也有竟闕略的這次是一個有糸統的方案、所以前後一貫旣無重複之處、也少衝突之點、旣無太詳之處也較爲完全而不闕略再就形式而論、上次有四百零二案、這次只有一案、上次各案、各有理由和辦法、有的并且只有理由而無辦法、這次則分章分節、歷舉辦法而略去理由、有的并且一點理由不説明、</p>
<h3>（三）分類不同</h3>
<p>上次的提案、因提案的審查的便利、分爲三民主義敎育、敎育行政、敎育經費、普通育、社會敎育、高等敎育、體育和軍事敎育職業敎育科學敎育、藝術敎育、出版物及圖書館改進私立學校、共十二組、這次的方案分爲實施義務敎育初步計畫、實施成年補習敎育初步計畫、籌設各級各種師資訓練機關計畫改進初等敎育計劃、改進中等敎育計畫改進高等敎育計畫改進社會敎育計畫改進並發展華僑敎育計畫、實施蒙藏敎育計畫全方案總預算、芡計十章、兩相比較、除高等敎育和社會敎育分類相同外、其餘都有出入、這次方案、關於敎育行政的本身組織、説得很少、關於各部份的敎育行政方法、納入於各種計劃中、所以未曾列爲一類、敎育經費餘開一　　要若干的「全方案總預算」外、應該如何籌措、本來不是敎育界的責任、改進私立學校本是普通敎育高等敎育中的一種行政主法、體育和軍事的敎育科學敎育、藝敎育、出版物、有的有關於課程、有的關於行政設施、職業敎育、是中等敎育的一種圖書館是社會敎育或學校的敎育的、一端所以這次方案、也都没有列爲一類、本來改進初等敎育、可以包括義務敎育、改進社會敎育、可以包括成年補敎育、改進初中高各等敎育、可以包括師資訓練、都不必另立一章、所以另列的緣故一則因爲中央對於普及敎育（就是義務敎育和成年補習敎育）異常注意、一則師資訓練和普及敎育最有關係、至於華僑敎育和蒙藏敎育、自有他的特殊之點、所以也各另立一類、總而言之、兩次提案的分類、這一次比前一次　有系統了、</p>
<h3>（四）内容不同</h3>
<p>這裹可以分别的説、Ａ上次有提案、因爲現在已經另案或照案施行或正在推行中、這次方案中不再提及的、計有下列各事項、</p>

<p>Ｍ關於以學校敎育補救社會敎育的、（同上）</p>
<p>Ｎ關於推行職業敎育整頓工商學校的、（納入改進中等和高等敎育計畫中、）</p>
<p>總而言之、上次的提案、零碎而不完整、而且辦法不很妥當、這次方案中比較已有周密的規定了、現在把極有關係的再分説如下、</p>
<h3>（一）義務敎育計畫</h3>
<p>上次定十年完全實現、也未想到中國有四千萬失學兒童、需要一百四十萬敎員、一百萬間敎室、每年要二億八千萬元經費、更没有如何分期設學培養師資、增加敎室等法、這次方案、把各種問題提通盤籌算詳細計畫、完全實現的期限、定爲二十年、</p>
<h3>（二）成年補習敎育計畫</h3>
<p>上次减除文盲的提案、規定十五歲以上、五十歲以下的民衆、共須各受四個月的的識字、補習敎育、以民衆讀本、算法等爲課目、很爲簡單、這次方案則計畫須使二億零二百多萬人、在六年内分期各受四個月的三民主義千字課等讀書、識字運用四權等的敎育、須訓練敎育十三萬五千人、需用敎室十一萬二千四百七十間經費共需二億八千三百四十餘萬元、而且把如何培養師資、增加校舍設備、經費預算、敎材編輯、實施手續、强迫辦法等、都一一詳細規定、</p>
<h3>（三）訓練師資計畫</h3>
<p>上次有整理師範制度和訓練鄉村敎育師資的提案、内容很簡單、這次把次把目標訓練完成期限（五年）程度、年限、設置辦法、課程大要、實習辦法、待遇和服務、中小學敎員進修辦法、職業科師資訓練法等都一一詳定在方案中、</p>
<h3>（四）改進初等敎育計畫</h3>
<p>上次雖也有不少的提案、但是偏而不全的、關於課程標準的較多餘如關於敎員待遇進修的、也有幾案、但也都是初步的大綱、這次方案、把有關初等敎育的一切如小學、幼稚園的設置經費、建築設備、敎職員、修業期限、學級編制、訓育收費、課程、衛生敎育、輔導制度等、都一一詳加規定完全無缺、在課程和敎職員待遇等節中、並且有進一步的辦法</p>
<h3>（五）改進中等敎育計畫</h3>
<p>上次提案關於中等敎育的、也很偏而不全、也是</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>課程標準佔多數、這次方案、則和大學小學的銜接法、中學的設置標準、經費預算、科學實騐、高中普通科程度的提高、職業科的實習、私立中學的整頓等、凡中等敎育廳應注意的各點、都一一規定辦法、比較上次、也完整得多了、</p>
<h3>（六）改進高等敎育計畫</h3>
<p>上次提案、關於高等敎育的、除派遣留學生、舉行畢業考試及授予學位外、其餘差不多没有了這次方案、則有充實内容辦法、推廣大學辦法、提高學生程度及謀畢業生出路辦法、派遣留學生辦法、籌設專校辦法、並有經費預算等、比較上次也完備得多、</p>
<h3>（七）改進社會敎育計畫</h3>
<p>上次　提案、關於社會敎育的比較多些、但也有所殘缺、這次方案要目有實施大網農工商職業補習敎育、籌設並推廣社會主要機關籌備特殊敎育和感化敎育、改良風俗及提倡民衆娛樂、社會敎育與學校敎育合作辦法經費預算等、也比較的詳備得多、</p>
<h3>（八）改進並發展華僑敎育計畫</h3>
<p>上次關於這類的提案、寥無幾、這次則把前次中央訓練部華僑敎育會議所議决的一切、完全納入、而且補充了不少的辦法、所以這方案很覺完整、凡目標、機關（行政、敎育會等）組織經費設計事項、學校敎育、社會敎育、都詳定辦法、關於華僑敎育的全部計畫、差不多有遣漏的了、</p>
<h3>（九）實施蒙藏敎育計畫</h3>
<p>上次關於這類的提案最少、只有兩題、而且都很籠統、這次則行政有辦法、普通敎育有辦法、高等敎育有辦法、社會敎育有辦法、還有經費預算、以及編印書館等等、差不多都是特别增加、而且都很體的、</p>
<h3>（十）總預算</h3>
<p>上次完全没有、是這次特别增加的、因爲這次是整個的方案、所以應將二十年内總預算列入、計第一年需費七千多萬、逐年遞加二千萬到第二十年加至四億九千多萬各項敎育經費都在内看了上述種種、可以知道兩次會議的各有不同之點、但是這並不是兩次會議、有甚麽優劣、不過説上次會議似乎是草創、這次會議似乎是修飾罷了、旣有上次的會議、京應該有這次的會議、上次旣會議旣如彼、這次會議就應該如此、正是相反相成、相爲表裹的、</p>
<p>最後要説明的、這次會議的提案、最缺略的有兩點、一則缺少關於三民主義敎育進一步的實施計畫、二則敎育行政方面的事項、如行政組織、行政人員訓練··也差不多没有、但聽説已有了補救的方法了、關於行政的敎育部擬屈留各省敎育廳長各特别市敎育局長（或者他們的代表）、和他們所指定的人員等、另開一兩天敎育行政會議專議敎育行政問題任各會員自由提案、關於三民主義敎育的、中央訓練部擬以書面向各會員徴求見、資參考、</p>
<p>至於這次方案、自然也有許多的缺點、不在本題範圍内、現在不多説了、</p>
<h3>方案提要（一）</h3>
<p>改進全國敎育方案、内容豐富、長有十餘萬言之多、大會討論時、殊覺不便、乃將各方案删去其理由、編成方案摘要、於開會時、印發各會員以便討論、茲將各案提要原文分次紀載下、</p>

<p>廣州市敎育局於民國九年即已成立、至本年正月奉令改廣州爲特别市、同年三月特别市敎育局成立、本人任局長全市敎育在二三年前受軍事及共黨把持之影響、能維持現狀、民已屬不易、絶無發展之可能、到近一二年間市政安定、各事漸上軌道敎育事業、乃得日漸進展、敎育經費亦以近一二年間增加最多、現全市敎育經費每月已增至十二萬元、市立中等學校共有九所、計中學·帥範·職業·職工·商業·工業·美術·保姆學校各一所署假後新設中學二所·其校舍正在建築中、完全小學全市共八十校、附設幼稚園者有址餘校以個人經騐論、小學校之數量宜少、而每校之級數須多、則辦理較易、而成效易見、全市私立小學之受補助者亦有近三十校、至詳細統計、本人已編就向大會報告書一份將全市最近敎育槪况統計、分别編入、以供參考、小學敎員月薪之最低級助敎爲四十元、正敎員四十七元一角每年籧增七元五角最高額增至一百八十元爲止中學敎員月薪則以鐘點計算、初中敎課一小時支洋五元至七元不等、高中自八元至九元、以上均以毫洋計算、</p>

<h3>目次</h3>
<p>▲普遍的義務敎育未能實現以前暫時補救的辦法案（三種）</p>
<p>（甲）提高入學年齡縮短就學年限的義務敎育試騐區案</p>
<p>（乙）試騐自修制度案</p>
<p>（丙）選拔全國天才兒　施以各級義務敎育案</p>
<p>▲中小學應設特别班案</p>
<p>▲規定留學生公費標準案</p>
<p>▲請敎育部限制敎育經費困難的省份及機關派遣學生留學外國並如何善後案</p>
<p>▲大中小學敎職員及學生應着要國服裝並用本國材料案</p>
<p>▲學校中的校旗標語徽章校歌口號等應一律用本國文案</p>
<p>▲民衆敎育課程的商榷案</p>
<p>▲普遍的義務敎育未能實現以前暫時補救的辦法案（三種）</p>
<p>施行義務敎育、强迫敎育、等於紙上談兵　已經好多年了牠的最大原因、就是經費的問題、照現在的財力狀况而觀、政府雖有實施普遍的義敎的决心、恐怕最近幾年中難於實現、若是靜待全國財力充裕之後方能施行、則此種理想、將永久成爲吾人心目中的幻象了、但是在現今經濟能力之下、難道就没有一種其體的辦法、以求接近、假定不能充分逹到、這　種的理想嗎、現在爲眼前救濟的目的、不揣固陋、謹擬三種辦法、以供辦義敎者的參考、不過旣不是「自古已有之、」又不是「歐美皆然、」恐怕不免爲社會一般人所詬病罷、</p>
<p>（甲）提高入學年齡縮短就學年限的義務敎育試騐區案、</p>
<p>（一）理由</p>
<p>（一）據最近敎育部公布的實施義務敎育初步計劃、所定就學的年限、爲六至十一二歲間、（學齡兒童）的四年、這種新規定、已經比從前减少二年了但是以我國的經濟現狀而觀、恐怕四年的義敎、還感困難所以應當想出一種還要經濟的辦法、這就是以提高入學年齡十一歲至十七歲之間、縮短就學年限、二年作爲暫時的救濟、如此則國家的負担、可以减輕一半、四年的義務敎育、假定每個兒童應費二十八元的經費、可以减到十四元了、</p>
<p>（二）據近來心理學專家研究成人學習的結果、我們才知道從前所承認的幼年時代、爲學習的黄金時代這一名話、並不是絶對的、原來年長者（五十歲以下者）學習的能力、非但不是都比年幼者力弱而且有時反比他們爲强、材料之須推理能力者、當然年齡大些的比幼童爲勝而不知學習之人、充筋肉動作者、靑年及壯年的人、也比十歲以下的兒童爲高、因此推論十一歲至十七歲之間的兒童如施以二年的敎育、其所獲到的基本知識和技能、或能勝於六歲至十二歲之間的四年敎育、</p>
<p>（三）學習的能力、並不是在學校裹成功的惟一元素此外情緒的影響也很大　年齡稍大的兒童對於人生的意義、略有一點的覺悟、他們知道不</p>
<h3>會塲内部</h3>
<p>（南京光華照相）</p>
<p>學的害處、甩以必定比年幼者爲勤苦他們的眼光也遠大一點、看得見他們所受的敎育、在他們的生活上、有什麽補助、因此他們的學習、就有了動機了、所以四年中應學到基本的知識和技能、如能用理想的方法分配去敎授、一定能够年内學完、而且有較好的成績</p>
<h3>（二）辦法</h3>
<p>（一）由敎育部通令各省選擇一二縣、作爲提高入學年齡、縮短就	學年限的義務敎育試騐區、</p>
<p>（二）調查該區内十一至十七歲的兒童的總數、其已人普通中小學的十一歲至十七歲的兒童、不在試騐的範圍以内、所以應當减去項兒童的數目、</p>
<p>（三）按照十一至十七歲兒童的需要、在試騐區内設立若干小學校、</p>
<p>（四）强迫該試騐區内的十一歲到十七歲失學的兒童、入新設的小學、無論何人不得藉故規避、</p>
<p>（五）由敎育部聘請專家、編制二年小學的課程、並編成各科的課本、務使合於此種齡的兒童的能力及興趣、並擬定近於理想的敎法及行政、以爲各試騐區施行的南針、但一切規定、以寬爲主俾各試騐區、可以按照地方的情形、便於自由試騐、</p>
<p>（六）各區試騐的杨續及困難的情形當隨時報告以供專家的研究並作改良的根據、</p>
<p>（七）二年以後所得的結果、如果能如我們所預期的、省却一半的經費、而得到相等或較好的成績、則此種辦法、可令各地普遍的採用等到國家財力充足的時候、就可以增加普遍的義敎育的年限、到三年四年至於六年八年、</p>
<p>（乙）試騐自修制度案</p>
<p>（一）理由</p>
<p>當此師資缺乏校舍不足的時候、普遍的義務敎育、成爲不可能的事、最可憐的、就是每年開學的時候、許多來報名入學的兒童、因爲各班中額數已滿、而被摒於門外、（尙且這種事、是發生於幾個收費很大的小學）大家盡納税的義務、而没有同樣享到願意另出代價的權利、這是很不平的事、不得已祗好求其次者、去採用自修的制度、用這種制度、師資校舍、設備等、都不必增加、而可以使失學的兒童、或成人學到一點基本的知識和技能、</p>
<h3>（二）辦法</h3>
<p>（一）各省指定數縣、作爲試騐自修度的區域、</p>
<p>（二）指定一縣中幾個地位適中的小學、爲自修制度的中心、欲入學而不得、或不能全日入學的人、（不論成人或兒童）來到學校受幾次自修的指導、然後將材料領到家裹去自修、</p>
<p>（三）由敎育部聘請專家、後定自修的步骤、課程的標準、及敎材的内容、</p>
<p>（四）由敎育部編撰成人和兒童自修的敎材、以便採用、</p>
<p>（五）經過若干時的自修、經考試及格、可以發給某種憑證、</p>
<p>（六）由各校報告試騐自修制度的結果、以供研究並作改進的根據、</p>
<p>（七）如果得到很好的成續、就可以推廣實行（未完要聞</p>

<h3>勞工統計工作和計劃（續）</h3>
<p>▲上海特别市社會局</p>
<p>（Ｄ）工人生活程度調查、調查工我生活、到少有二個主要的目的、第一是要明瞭工人生活的環境、和一個工人家庭最低限度的生活費用、第二是求得生活費指數内應該包括的貸品和數量、照經濟上的原理、工作效率和生活環境、有密切的關係、臂如生活安適、身心上有適當發展、和受敎育的工人、他的工作效率和能力、常比生活環境惡劣、和没有受敎育的工人來得大、生産力自然也大、所以如果工人們能得安適的生活環境和受相當的敎育、那末對整個的國民經濟、可以增加許多的生産量、這是我們要研究工人生活狀况的最大原因、最近國民政府頒布工廠法内、規定工人的最低工資、應該拿當地工人的生活狀况爲標準、所以生活程度調查更是急不容緩、但是現在工人生活狀况是怎樣、是否查以同等地亨受現代物質文明的利益、什麽是一個普通工人家庭最低生活費、這些問題、非靠生活費調查、不能明瞭、在這個調查裹面、我們到少要知道、工人家庭、人口、年齡、性别、職業的分配、收入的來源和數目、每户平均支出食物費、衣着費、信屋費、燈光燃料費、其他費用等分配、每間平均居住人數、最低限度的生活費等項、（Ｅ）生活費指數及眞正工資指數、生活程度調查和生活費指數、是有分别的、前者是靜態的調查、調查某一個時期内工人生活的情形、後者　動態的調查、調查歷來生活費用增減變遷的趨勢、我們都知道消費的貨品、因爲市塲上供求的關係、價格時常變動、物價漲、生活程度高、物價落、生活程度低、所以生活程度是隨物價的高低而變動的、生活費指數、就是根據生活程度調查的結果、依照各種物品的消費量、分别保該物在指數中分量的輕重、再調查其物價、以求歷來維持原來的生活程度的費用、和標準年相比、編成指數、所以有了生活費指數、我們可以知道今年的生活程度、比標準年度、高出或低落百分之幾、依據這個來解决工資問題、最爲平允、編製指數、最好依食物費、居住費、衣着費、燈光燃料費、及雜費等、各編一分類指數、以觀各類消費個别的變遷情形、合各分類指數而成總指數、即所以表示一般生活程度的變遷、生活費指數、遷有一個目的、就是測量貨幣購買力的强弱、以求眞正工資指數、物價漲就是貨幣價値落或購買力弱、貨價落就是貨幣價値漲或購買力强、工人收入的工資、旣是用來購買維持生活的用品、但是貨幣的購買力旣然時常變動、所以工資眞正的價値、也隨之增減、臂如從前收入工資三十元、就可以維持生活、如果物價漲起百分之二十、那末現在非三十六元不可、因爲現在三十六元的價値、等從前的三十元、換句話説、從前三十元的物品、現在要三十六元才得買到、所以我們如果要使工資實際上的價値、没有變動、那末在編製貨幣工資指數之外、同時要顧到貨幣購買力的增減、生活費指數旣然是測量貨幤購買力的寒署表、所以把生活費指數除貨幣工資指數、再乘一００、即得眞正工資指數、意思就是測量工資眞正價値的變遷的指數、眞正工資指數、旣可以指示現在工人所得的工資是否足够維持他們原來的生活程度、我們就不難預謀補救的方法了、（Ｆ）工業災害、在機器生産制度之下、工人在工作的時候、意外的災害、幾乎是不可避免的事情、這在工人的本身、固然是直接受到傷害、就是工廠方面、如機器的毁損、傷害賠償、添換生手、生産效率減低等、損失也不在少數、凡此種種、間接也是社會的損失、最近各國工業災害、已大受注意、對於防災備、力求改進、但爲明瞭根本的原因和預防起見、必須借重統計、其中重要的項目、有各業發生災害次數和人數、發生原因、災害性質、傷害的部位、程度、日數、困傷害而損失的工數工資數出産數及撫恤費等等、（未完）</p>

<h3>遊春絮語</h3>
<p>— 楊家頤</p>
<p>▲遊春也有眞假之别。藝術家。</p>
<p>的遊春。要算最眞。而情人的遊春。却是最假。</p>
<p>▲假使你是歡喜走馬看花的。那末你切莫遊春。因爲如果這樣。眞眞的大自然美景。早已離你十八丈遠了。</p>
<p>▲遊春的時候。切不可貪懶。因爲貪懶了。你的腿兒。就不肯安步當車。</p>
<p>▲一個人遊春的興致最高的。只有在靑春時期。因這時男女的薄弱的心靈。有如草木一樣的在那兒發萌呀。</p>
<p>▲城市人眼裏的遊春。是一件寳貝。鄕村人眼裏的遊春。是一個玩意兒。</p>
<p>▲男女的結合在遊春時。要算最容易。因這時他們都受了大自然的洗禮。最容易互相吸引的緣故。</p>
<p>▲速記學與遊春是有密切的關係。假使在遊春時。你能把一事一物都記出來。那末遊春便可以有所憑藉了。</p>
<p>▲窮人一生的幸福。除了遊春之外。是得不到的。</p>
<p>▲遊春不但使你能飽覧春光。且可嚇退你的愁魔。</p>
<p>▲你同你的情人遊春時。切不可談起大自然的美與不美。因假使你談了。神經靈敏的伊。容易起妒的。</p>
<p>▲美國麥克圖格爾博士説。「一個人能在春光明媚中。多多閒散。那末。他的眞眞幸福。才能享到」。呀。這是多麽一句至理名言呀。（見美國雜誌）</p>
<h3>嘉賓選勝記</h3>
<p>— 百熙</p>
<p>春寒多雨。懶與病兼。花事將殘。猶慳蠟屐。忽也老友介子。返自金陵。道經梁溪。小駐萍蹤。並電邀報界聞人張竹平君。來錫同游。張君税駕之日。適爲舊曆清明。久雨乍晴。惠風和暢。一春游興。却因佳客之來。勃然動矣。與張俱來者。爲其夫人韻清。曁朱倚笛女士。榮氏女學校主張浣芬女士。均與有舊。設筵大新酒樓。爲之洗塵。並延唐謀伯俞慶棠伉儷作陪。蓋以客與唐俞二氏。有同鄕同學之誼。舊雨相逢。倍增佳興也。余與條甫夢蠂最後至。欲爲倉卒主人未成。而反作不速客。遂訂即晚梅園之宴。午後。余等至園。料量一切。介子則伴客至惠山公園品茗。復登錫山龍光塔。遍攬惠麓諸勝。旋過張巷。訪東大池。又至浣芬别墅。游倦來園。</p>
<h3>紅豆艷聞</h3>
<p>— 荆夢蠂</p>
<p>紅豆一物。自王摩詰咏後。遂有相思子之名。播入千古詩人詞客之作。不可勝紀。然此物産自嶺南。吾人初不易見也。惟虞山錢牧齋所居有紅豆一樹。因名紅豆山莊。自號紅豆老人。至今其樹猶存。絶勝故家喬木也。清明後一夕。吾友謝介子在錫。讌客於梅園。座有楊君。探懷出示雙紅豆。謂即買自虞山也。雙豆鮮紅可愛。狀圓而扁。光似珊瑚。座客爭相傳觀。楊君語余。此豆之生。每莢一粒。即間有兩粒者。其形亦大小不一。必取同莢一式成雙者。始稱雙紅豆。故尤難得而名貴也。士人相傳。得雙紅豆夫婦分佩之者。可來生世世爲夫婦。則勝長生殿之鈿盒多矣。豈物主故事宣傳。以爲居奇地耶。抑伉儷情深。借作同心結。遂生不解緣。或亦事理所有耶。是固勝佩萱草宜男。合歡蠲忿也。此爲吾生平得見紅豆之始。而介子時適以紅豆詞索和。余初詠紅豆。而即見紅豆。二妙相逢。得勿事有前緣耶。然而王孫芳草。游子天涯。急而催春。狂風掃景。桃花落盡。燕子不來。紅豆詞成。靑衫淚濕已。錄寄鵑公。以相印證。正恐鵑魂消瘦。與蝶夢凄迷。同一傷春感想耳。</p>
<p>雙紅豆慢（和介子韻原唱前見本欄）南國春深。東風信斷。盈盈滿樹相思。宮中記曲。閨裹傳詞。悲歡影事郎知。有線難維。枉纏綿費盡。一縷情痴。心坎茁雙枝。似啼珠。枕上凝時。看打罷鴛鴛。飼殘鸚鵡。待兒惟解偷嬉。胎愁更種恨。越玲瓏。越是徘徊。香夢初回。重拈處。柔魂欲飛。慰離人。添將小病生涯。</p>
<h3>没有生日的人</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>▲改曆聲中一大問題</p>
<p>歐西國。歷法委員會。爲求統一全世界曆法起見。最近創造新曆一種。年分十三月。月凡二十八日。餘多一日。爲公共休息日。現已議决自一九三三年一月起實行。惟此種曆法。一經實行。則我人之生日在二十八日以後。二十九。三十。三十一日者。勢將無生日可檢。且此後孩嬰誕生之日。適在公共休息日者。亦將無以名其月日矣。</p>
<p>陽曆二月爲二十八日。四年一閏。閏年二十九日。然人之誕生。適在二月二十九日都。四年之中。僅有生日一次。西人視爲不幸之事。而新曆一行。二十八日以後誕生之人。將永無生日。豈非大不幸乎。此亦改曆聲中一大問題也。</p>
<h3>種菊改良法</h3>
<p>— 小磊</p>
<p>五光十色之菊花。今將分種揰枝矣。語去。莫間收穫。但問耕耘。藝五榖然。藝供人觀賞之花卉。亦何獨不然。向者園丁揰菊。往往折多數菊枝之頭。長約三尺外。有四寸者。叢揰盆中。俟其茁有根鬚。乃始每盆一枝。分而種之。旣種後。往往阻其生機者半月。蓋分種時。根鬚與泥土脱離。受傷在是也。余於去歲。聞某君善藝菊。菊肥大而多花。就訪之。乞其傅授良法。某君曰。是亦何難。不過力矯園丁之弊而已。法宜一枝揰一盆。不復移種。免多受一次之損傷。土中宜和入三分糠屑。（即碾米廠中之糠。尋常用以　豕者）。盆宜較大。則根鬚舒展。擇菊枝之較肥者。折四寸許。去其頭。約寸許。乃以揰入盆中。半月即活。前已摘去其頭。故分茁三枝。俟所茁三枝略長。又摘去三枝之頭。則每枝又茁三枝。計共九枝。每有一朶頂花。共可開九朶。先和入土中之糠屑。即是肥料。其後又以　　之。則九朶之花肥大。與尋常不同矣。今已春雨如膏。菊芽肥茁。摘頭插菊之日已近。爲述所聞善藝菊家語。告諸有東籬癖者。</p>
<h3>臭蟲殺人</h3>
<p>— 維</p>
<p>余嘗談　臭蟲矣。蟲雖　。而其禍甚迾。足以殺人者也。戚家某氏。十年前其主尙在。有阿芙蓉癖。每夜非至二三點鐘不睡。令丫環一守其旁。以供驅使丫環阿翠。年祇十二三齡。深夜不可支。嘗於烟榻前之籐綳靠椅假寐。如是者二載餘矣。阿翠面無血色。目見憔悴。以爲失眠所致。彼時主之於奴。直類禽獸。亦不爲意。厥後憔悴愈甚。竟斃。主人以榻前之椅。。爲阿翠生前坐臥之物。擬移之他處。蓋此椅十數年來曾未稍動。迨椅搬開。坐墊脱落。但見夾層中蠕蠕然動。審視之。乃臭蟲也。不知其數。抓之得升許。連椅舉火焚之。於是始知阿翠之死。實由於臭蟲之噬。其血逐日已爲　吸殆盡。嘗見其假寐之際。輒時時牽動其軀。年幼無知。不加捉摸。外勞其筋骨。内吸其血液。積年累月。焉得不死。寃哉。</p>
<h3>南洋游記（十三）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>▲自西貢到新嘉坡</p>
<p>二月十八號晨六時。船離西貢。岸上士女紛紛送行。但此爲法屬地。上船者大抵爲法人。英人甚少。華人絶無。可怪也。同行者除余與陳開清君外。只鄺慈悲女醫師一人。鄺父爲廣州東山醫院院長。其家族十一人。均業醫。其姊現在法。今鄺雖在華已得醫師證。而尙欲到德進修也。據云。其姊已爲租一房於法。每月價不過合華銀三十元云。</p>
<p>船中海上。自有另一種生活。郵船在海船中爲較優之船。其頭二等舖設華麗。鮮花依人。皆以西侍女捧待。如日本之用下女也。有電影塲。音樂會。跳舞塲。坐椅中。長嘯海天。或於艙面爲各種游戲。其廣塲一望無邊。士女皆海上神仙矣。三等室亦有電扇。自來水。大菜間。可讀書寫字風琴任士女彈唱。四等亦可等於長江之房艙也。至外國工我水手。其生活衣着。依然粗劣。去平等遠矣。而茶房僕人。大抵凡經行中國及南洋一帶之船。而週船世界者。皆用中國茶房。可惜其所講均閩粵語也。不易懂。抑吾人不能不佩服閩粵人之創造世界力。偏凡有日光處。無不有華僑澳洲亦有之。而華僑大抵皆閩粵人。其以爲茶房之役。能走遍全球。隠然在世界勞工界占一大勢力。豈不偉大與。</p>
<p>十九日。氣候自西責以南。完全夏令。蓋西責已在熱帶之北十度。再向南行。袷衣不可復著。亦無有着長衣者也。船中有偏袒右肩圍長布裙。色淡黑頭　各色花布者。則印度人也。坐散艙。支以布蓬。或能華語。陳開清君言。印虎人善經商。在緬甸某處。有華人街。與印人對峙經商。而華人皆失敗。余問曰。是印度人聯合抵制華人乎。曰非也乃自然失敗。曰何故。曰彼等對用人甚刻苦。自奉麵包清水。勤儉過於華人。又不大講表面。房子起居。全不講究。我華人稍寬裕。則手把鬆。即講排埸。待雇夥亦寬大。結果華人商務即失敗而印商致富。腰纍纍矣。余曰。彼腰纍纍以後。將何爲。答。彼等亦無在智識。只再求更憲富。而仍吝嗇。余曰。此眞西語所謂猶太人也。西語猶太人之意爲財奴之意。言其他思想耳。觀於猶太人印度人之努力致富。而國家民族及文化運動之缺乏。吾民族不可不自勵也。國家文化之不競。雖腰纍纍爲人奴。亦可悲矣。尤願我國之富人注意及此。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（一七一）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十回　赤燄騰天勾攔欽孝女　紅毹貼地即席晤名伶　　當時有許多人。也開了竈間天井裹的自來水龍頭。旋滿了一桶水。便拿來澆上去。眞是杯水車薪。無濟於事。。有許多鄰近的人家。也不顧救火的事了。。只顧着自已家裹搬取箱籠物御。衖堂裹本來已經擠了許多人。加着再要各人家搬出的物件。有的隨便的擺在里裹。。所搬出來的物件。。並不是齊整的物。。舖蓋連被褥一捲。於是牀上的東西。灑落了一地。有的把帳子也卸下來。一時大器小喊的聲音。嚷成一片。蕊雲的娘大阿姨。急得口中只是念着阿彌陀佛。阿彌陀佛。又埋怨着阿金道。你怎麽還是看好看呢。也不帮我理着箱子。阿金道。我也急得没有下手之處。敎我理了那一隻箱子好呢。這時蕊雲回來。幸虧把所有揰戴都卸了下來。安放在一隻小官箱裹。這小官箱下了鎖。鑰匙是歸大阿姨自已管的。向來如此。阿金道。那末你這一隻首飾箱歸好了没有。大阿姨道。早已歸好了。阿金道。歸好了就是了。你的財産。横豎都在這一隻首飾箱中。大阿姨道。還有衣裳咧。難道就不管嗎。阿囡的衣服也不少呀。阿金道。那些衣服。一時從那裹理去呢。左詩晨道。你們把要緊的東西理理。不要緊的東西。隨他吧。上海的救火很快的。一刻兒工夫。救火車就來了。此地還隔開一條腰衖。離開兩家人家。我想是不要緊的。正説時。只聽丁當丁當一陣鈴聲響。大家説工部局的救火車已到了。但見許多救火會裹的外國人中國人。頭上戴着金黄的銅帽盔。身上穿了救火的制服。脚上都是長過了膝部的皮靴。到了衖堂裹。把那些看火燒的閑人驅逐出去。讓開了一條路。把佷粗的皮帶管拖了進來。套上自來水龍頭。一刻兒工夫。只見本來帶扁的皮帶。漸漸兒飽滿發胖了。成了個圓圓的竹筒式了。先有幾個救火人擺梯子擱在過街樓上。一個個上去。腰間揰了斧頭鑿子之類。那窗子本來是關閉的。只一斧頭。便把他劈開了　　　　　　　。將皮帶管子裝了進去。還有别處的皮帶也吸足了水。向火頭躍出的那邊噴上去。一時間火勢便　下去。火威便熄下去。那蕊雲等一班小姊妹。到底還是小孩子。他們從來也没有見過上海救火的。他們站在洋台上。倒覺好耍了。一點也不發急。　工一句俗語。呌做「火燒好看。難爲了人家」。</p>

<p>▲到期欵之處置　今日又爲大比期之一　　對於到期應須交割者、核數逹七八百萬、全滬各錢莊及小銀行等不下百餘家、每家有數十萬、或百餘萬不等、昨據業中人、謂此届以對内銀根、深感拮据、錢莊多銀之家、固然不少、然爲防患計、亦不敢儘量開做、而缺銀者亦比比皆是勢必將此届放欵收回、但客號之存欵長期現在亦須擇殷實而付與故將老户收回、放與新户、故本届交割進出更繁、而轉賬者實屬有限、惟小銀行方面、頭襯孔多、或者稍有溢出、亦未可知</p>
<p>▲甬莊客之畢集　寗波各莊類率多銀　向來將大批　　　存放滬莊、代爲做出、每期敷額、不下一千六七百萬、大約以月底到期者多爲其他　（十五·二十·二十五）三期亦有少數　　故目前有往來之甬莊、均紛紛派員來滬接洽、據聞甬莊方面康欲照例轉期繼續、　因滬莊以市面不好、不肯負責代放、故是否收回目下尙　疑問、須俟過二十五日以後、方可規定耳、</p>
<p>▲已做出之息價　自星期五六及昨日等做出長期欵之新交易、及轉賬賡績欵增、由各莊及小銀行做出者、總額約三百餘萬、爲福新·茂新·申新三廠、及茶棧方面等所吸收、規定息價、三廠爲九兩二錢半六對、茶棧方面不過數十萬、息價八兩半及八兩二錢半、此外洋行街方面各帮亦略做進敷十萬、息價亦在八九兩間、故此届息價、較上期便宜二兩及七錢半之</p>
<p>▲客帮無力償還　到期客帮應還長期欵、以値營業不振、市面又受外匯及種種影響、致大宗應收欵項、尙未流通、故對莊欵、亦不能如期清償、旋因債權方面催急、不獲已而擱淺呆滯者、計有川帮兩家　海參歲帮靑島帮天津帮建帮等各有傳染、共計莊欵不下二十餘萬、</p>
<h3>銀行有買賣市塲延長半小時</h3>
<p>▲市塲槪况　昨日銀行照常辦公、交易比較瑣繁、晨市本有買賣踴躍之勢、迨至午市、供求格外起勁、致市塲中收盤時間、特别延長半小時、至二時十分始散市爲平素難遇之特殊情形、據聞最要關鍵、係爲各方限價所致、滬南中行賣出、北市中國總行買進、彼此爲二毫半之價、相持不下、是以擱遲半小時耳、</p>
<p>▲厘拆價格　（洋厘）早市爲七錢二分０三毫七忽半、與前日　舊相埓、午市則略高一毫二忽半、爲七錢二分０半厘、緣近日供求兩方、功力悉敵、是以無甚軒輊耳、（銀拆）早午市統開四分、較前日早午市回昂一二分、劃頭加水、因銀行進倉多、故有四五分市面、</p>
<p>▲輔幣市情　江南小洋、早市買氣甚佳、收盤價遽爾高至六錢二分二厘半、午市賡續好起一厘、計爲三厘半、做出交易、早市七千角、午市一萬二千角、客路又復購二萬餘角廣東小洋、早市爲五錢九分八厘七毫半、午市爲八厘二毫半、與前日相彷、做出交易早市十七萬五千角、午市五萬五千角、銅元又長一千五百文、爲三百九十四千五百文、</p>
<p>▲銀洋進出（銀欵）昨日銀行收解消息、頗形旺盛、計華商收解票欵二百五六十萬、外商收解票欵二百餘萬、特收欵項外商一百二十餘萬、特出欵項華商八十餘萬、所有各種貨滙税什及電匯欵絲欵出來等、收解數額共計一千餘萬、進倉八十萬出倉六十萬、日商銀行收解各欵四百三四十萬進倉五十萬、錢莊銀公單收解三千一百餘萬、劃頭欵收解四百萬左右、各路匯欵收解一百三十餘萬、收現七八十萬、（洋欵）匯劃票欵早市做出一百０四萬五千、午市一百二十三萬五千、鈔票早市無市、午市一萬五千、塲外鈔票早市十二萬三千、午市八萬七千、現洋早市七萬五千、午市十四萬、新幣早市二萬、英洋三四萬、銀行交易、早市七十萬午市互市六十萬、各銀行洋户往來收解一百七十餘萬、鈔票進出二百餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解四百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百八十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出一百十餘萬、小錢莊進出鈔票匯頭現洋新幣等交易五六十萬、客路裝去者有漢口四十萬、北路三十萬、廣帮二十萬、内地十五萬、香港裝英洋新幣十五萬、來源無聞、</p>

<h3>紗花　時局不安爲紗銷唯一之障礙</h3>
<p>紗市疲軟、趨勢甚衰、實以時局緊張、現銷不振、故人心軟化、即有上漲、終無長力也、但實方廠商態度尙捶挺、仍無放鬆之念、而大户賣方亦擯持不抵、多空兩方、爭鬥甚力、且一部份散户空頭、在近月加碼、故本月份前途、尙有巨大之變化也、</p>
<p>▲近期紗跌一兩外　人標前市開盤、七月份市氣仍緊、賣户不多、二三盤聞現紗銷路不輰、三品平、買進者缺乏、形勢鬆懈、各月跌二·三·五·六錢、午後市勢愈疲、且賣氣甚熾、本月跌一兩、遠跌一·四·五錢、場中交易未旺、全日成交統計一萬三千四百五下包、茲將人標收盤價綠左、</p>

<h3>棉市跌勢甚猛</h3>
<p>棉市轉軟、跌風頗熾、良以海外棉市、漲勢告靜、市上現棉銷路不輰、廠需岑寂、故人心稍疲、獲利者了結、市面鬆懈云、</p>
<p>▲期棉跌去三錢　漢標前市開盤、因外棉平澹、場中買氣冷靜、且了結者愈盛、各月猛跌二錢半至三錢半、午後獲利者扒空、稍形回平、結果各月漲跌五分至一錢、全日成交統計三萬六千九百担茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>英印棉業週訊</h3>
<p>▲孟買　上週因假期二日、營業受阻、週三以政局不靖、市價跌小、收盤時略堅、現需平和、歐洲及遠東之廠商均未見興味、早到之標準棉、已爲本地廠家所吸收、白羅溪在交貨額已逹二萬四千三百包、大半爲本地商所收進、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>

<p>輪往中國　　　　　　　二四九　　二六０</p>
<p>輪往日本　　　　　　　七七四　　八０四</p>
<p>其他各地　　　　　　　　四一　　　四二</p>
<p>▲利物浦　上週現需平和、期貨賣均有、市價平平、同業方面、在美國農部舉　動之結果以前、暫取觀望態度、同時預算期將近、亦爲營業受阻之一因、埃及棉　依然靜寂、埃及方面之蟲疫報告、未受影響、</p>
<h3>糧食　陰雨米市沉寂</h3>
<p>▲閘北　昨日各路到源仍靜、河存依然未減、北粳市益沉寂、頂貨交易不旺、中關略動、行情微修、午間有站定之象、薄稻到銷兩滯、高貨亦轉下游、中次更鮮主顧、羊秈河下殊枯、走銷平常、大盤尙穏、杜子客埠去化尙可、存貨凋零、價仍不動、通變陰元銷而不化、吊胃極呆情况無榮辱、全日各米交易不旺、價則趨平、</p>

<h3>期小絞續漲錢餘</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、以客帮之注目、形勢續見佳象、惟現米因有解貨、交易不多行情祗好數分、售開二號西貢二千包價十四元九角一分、小絞米二千包、價十四元六角八争、敏黨二千包、價十四元七角八分又糙米六百包價十四元二角九分、一號西貢存多銷細、開一千包、價十五元四角半、中次照降、</p>

<h3>天雨提高粉市</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午四五月份開價因洋麥報小五六七角、人心曾一度虚軟、惟遠期新份、曾不因洋麥之報小、減其方興味艾之熱　、因前晚急雨甚　昨日又朱放晴、　内外人心大形激昂、買氣甚　蓋故多者惟恐年收之豐稔、今見如是天氣、從之　　自爲意中之事、至下午開盤買氣更激、交易尤惕、一部分蘇帮及大部分之江北帮、均隨市補空、因此市面愈開　高以天時爲轉移之新粉、固爲歷年司空見慣之事、惟　以本年之人心、爲更激烈也、近期以實銷依然不前、故尙平穏、結果本月份較前日漲二釐半、五月份漲一分、六七月份漲一分七釐半八九月份呼漲二分云、</p>
<h3>遠期新麥激漲八分</h3>
<p>昨日期麥粉銷不佳、現存豐厚、人心未見起勁至遠期新麥、因春雨不已、氣候又寒、人心激局異常、尤以六月份市氣爲更激烈、因春雨太多、收成豐歉固不能預測、但收汎當須緩遲、人心側重或係此故、至客帮中南京及江北帮、因抛售甚夥、從事大補空頭、故市面節節上漲、結果本月份較前週收價小一分、六月份漲八分之巨七月份漲三分、八份漲四分、九月份漲三分、現麥成交甚輰、價尙平穏、高貨較前週似小去一二分因廠方大家硬擯也、開南宿州麥五兩一錢六分、清江浦麥五兩一錢六分蚌埠麥·徐州麥五兩一錢六分、明光麥五兩一錢、至一錢三分、共開、萬四千包由福新辦去云、</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Preparations of the Japanese Parliament</h3>
<p>In this Japanese parliament, the government party has obtained a majority of the members, which seems more solid compared to the Seiyukai Tanaka Cabinet of the previous time. However, although it has many seats in the Diet, its relations with the House of Peers are poor. Therefore, it is not as good as the Tanaka Cabinet, which could have prolonged its days. This is due to the relationship of Japanese political history, which is slightly different from a purely congressional system.</p>
<p>Throughout history, the shaking of the Japanese government has often not been due to important issues in parliament, but to one or two minor matters that are opposed by the elder statesmen and nobility, leading to an irreversible collapse. Even the recent Tanaka Cabinet suffered the same fate. Although it initially withstood impeachment in the Diet and opposition from outside, it was as stable as Mount Tai. Later, when all major issues were resolved, it suddenly collapsed. Therefore, the future of the current Hamaguchi Cabinet may not be an exception. The difficulty of the current Hamaguchi Cabinet is superficially the unemployment problem, but the main issue in the shadows is perhaps the issue of military reduction. The elder statesmen and nobility are mostly dissatisfied with and oppose the concession to Britain and the United States in the London Naval Treaty. Because of the sake of diplomatic appearance, they cannot overturn the treaty. However, the result will inevitably blame the cabinet for improper handling and make the cabinet uneasy in its position.</p>

<h3>US Representative Stimson Praises the Success of Naval Reduction</h3>
<p>The Fifth Plenary Session Yesterday</p>
<p>Adopted Reports of Two Committees</p>
<p>Jurists Are Busy Drafting Articles</p>
<p>Japanese Finance Minister Fully Authorized to Return Home Early</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 14th: The fifth plenary session of the Naval Conference was held today, lasting twenty-five minutes. British Prime Minister MacDonald, as chairman, announced that the meeting was to adopt the reports of the expert committee and the first committee, some of which had been agreed upon. However, it belonged to the scope of reservations made by the Italian delegation at the beginning of the Naval Conference. The first report of the first committee contained many reservations, the most important of which was the exchange of destroyers and light cruisers proposed by the Japanese delegation. When this reservation was read, US Chief Representative Stimson stated that the first committee had agreed on this matter on Saturday and Sunday. Prime Minister McDonald then read the other five reports, which were unanimously adopted by the committee and the plenary session. The first report was only recorded. Prime Minister McDonald continued, once the reports are adopted, the conference can proceed to draft the agreement, which is expected to be signed on the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, London, 13th: US Chief Representative Stimson said in a broadcast on the London Broadcasting Station today that the degree of naval limitation achieved by the agreement between Britain, the United States, and Japan can be said to be the most effective. The three countries have now agreed to reduce a net amount of 560 million tons of ships that have been built, are being built, and are planned.</p>
<p>According to this method, the tonnage reduced is even lower than the existing tonnage of Italy. As for France and Italy, we also hope that they can join in making the same limitation steps. Stimson also said that the main purpose of this conference is to further limit naval forces, which was not completed by the Washington Conference League Conference and the Geneva Mutual Conference. It can be said that the purpose of the United States, Britain, and Japan this time has been completely advanced.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 13th: Jurists were commissioned to draft the articles of the Three-Power Agreement and were very busy yesterday, assisted by the expert committee.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 14th: It is reported that the Japanese representative at the Naval Conference, Navy Minister Admiral Zaibu, telegraphed the government to allow him to leave London on April 27. The government's intention was to have Zaibu return home after the signing of the agreement between Britain, the United States, and Japan, which is scheduled for approximately April 22. However, Zaibu wanted to leave England before signing in order to avoid his name being added to the agreement because the military does not support this agreement. The government wanted Zaibu to sign, and the parliament will hold a three-week special session starting on April 21, and it is very unwilling for Zaibu to return home during this period to attend the meeting and make statements that are unfavorable to the government when the opposition party questions the government's naval policy.</p>

<h3>Japanese Parliament Prepares for a Major Debate</h3>
<p>The Session Is Only Three Weeks</p>
<p>In Reality, Only Ten Days</p>
<p>Important Bills Piled Up Like Mountains</p>
<p>The Ruling and Opposition Parties Are Discussing Countermeasures</p>
<p>▲Japanese United Press, Tokyo, 14th: The 58th Special Session of the Japanese Parliament will be convened on the 21st. However, the session is only three weeks long, and the House of Representatives will not have questions until after the Prime Minister's speech on the 25th. Until the closing ceremony on May 14, April 26 is the cherry blossom viewing banquet, April 29 is the Emperor's birthday, and April 27, May 4, and May 11 are Sundays. Therefore, the actual number of days for discussion is only 14 days. Subtracting several days for the committee, the number of days for this meeting is only about ten days. However, this special parliament is the first policy discussion between the current cabinet and the opposition party, and it proposes many urgent legal bills and important parliamentary matters for additional budgets. Even if the House of Representatives passes the bills by an absolute majority, it is doubtful whether the House of Peers will have the time to deliberate carefully.</p>
<p>▲Electric Communication Agency, Tokyo, 14th: The special parliament is about to be convened, and important proposals such as the problem of the aftermath of the lifting of the gold ban, the naval disarmament agreement, the problem of increasing the national treasury burden for compulsory education fees, the unemployment problem, and rural countermeasures are piled up like mountains. Although the government relies on an absolute majority, it pretends to be calm. However, the debate between the current cabinet and the opposition party is the first time, and the anti-government atmosphere in the House of Peers is very strong. Therefore, there will inevitably be a fierce debate in the upcoming parliament, and the development of the debate must be after the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister's speech on the 25th, explaining the policy direction. The Prime Minister's speech has been detailed and exhaustive due to the dissolution of the parliament. On that day, the enemy can stop. Foreign Minister Bihara explained in detail the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement and other issues related to the disarmament issue, and Minister of Finance and Commerce explained in detail the budget and additional budget implemented in the fifth year.</p>
<p>▲Electric Communication Agency, Tokyo, 14th: The government relies on an absolute majority in the Lower House and intends to monopolize the speaker and vice-speaker, and the chairman of the budget committee to appoint the committee chairman. It is currently searching for candidates. The voices of Fujisawa Kininosuke for speaker and Morita Shige for chairman of the budget committee are the highest. The general affairs in the House of Representatives are coordinated by Kayama Michio, Yoriimoki Keiki, and Nakamura Keijiro to control the House of Representatives. If the Seiyukai faction responds to the Minseito to obtain committee members and others, it will inevitably exercise the strength of an absolute majority and implement the original proposal. The Seiyukai side will always take the policy as the basis, and scrutinize the government's malfeasance, list the facts of election interference, and propose a motion of no confidence in Interior Minister Adachi alone. In short, the ruling and opposition parties are currently discussing how to deal with the enemy, sparing no effort.</p>
<h3>White Russians in Britain Plot to Restore the Monarchy</h3>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Memorial Week for the Central Government and the National Government</h3>
<p>▲Central Party Headquarters: At 9:00 AM on the 14th, the Central Party Headquarters held the 55th Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Central Committee members Chen Guofu, Wang Zhengting, and Enhe Batu, along with guests Sun Zhen and She Tonghua, representatives of the Ningbo City Yin County Boy Scout Troop from Zhejiang, and 400-500 staff members from the Central Party Headquarters, attended. Chairman Chen Guofu presided over the ceremony. Afterwards, Wang Zhengting delivered a report, stating that when considering our nation's position, the rebellion of Yan Xishan and his reactionary elements has a significant impact. Whether our country can be unified and whether we can implement sovereign power hinges on this. Because a nation's strength lies in its sovereign power. Now, Yan Xishan and others are acting recklessly and rebelliously, which is destroying sovereign power and undermining the foundation of the Chinese nation, turning it into a separatist situation. If a country becomes a separatist form, it will be impossible to gain equal status internationally. Therefore, the current actions of Yan Xishan and others pose a danger of putting the Chinese nation to death. If we do not use all our strength to eliminate them, we will not be able to seek our own survival. As for the methods of suppressing the rebellion, the central government is of course prepared. Now, we only need to consider what fundamental methods to use to gradually make our country sound and to make our country's power grow stronger. Of course, construction is still the foundation. I believe that the goal of construction should be to increase the happiness of ordinary people in general, increase the abilities of ordinary people in general, and enable ordinary people to be happy. There are three ways to achieve this goal: (1) Facilitate transportation to increase production capacity, so we must immediately implement road repairs and river dredging. (2) Increase the common knowledge of ordinary people in general, which is to implement universal education, and be sure to enable those engaged in a certain industry to have specialized knowledge and skills in their own industry. For example, China has been an agricultural country since ancient times, but its agricultural production volume is far behind that of the United States. American farmers have sufficient common knowledge and considerable specialized knowledge and skills in agriculture. Therefore, the cotton acreage planted in China and the United States is equal, but the cotton production in the United States often exceeds our cotton production by three or four times. By analogy, we can see that the success of construction cannot begin without universal education. (3) Promote national sports. We must know that we must first have a strong body to have a strong spirit. With a strong spirit, we will have a strong career. Therefore, the health of a country's people often affects the strength or weakness of the nation. Therefore, from the fundamental point of view of construction, we must first work hard on the above three points, and then the success of construction will be easier, and it will be easier to gain equal status internationally. The meeting adjourned after the report. ▲National Government: At 10:00 AM on the same day, the National Government held Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Chiang Kai-shek, Tan Yankai, Sun Ke, Zhu Peide, Gu Yingfen, Shao Yuanchong, Yi Peiji, Chen Yi, Wei Daoming, Zhang Nanxian, Jiang Menglin, Liu Ruihuan, Zhou Yawei, Li Jinlun, Zhang Wohua, and more than 300 officials and military personnel attended. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek presided over the ceremony. Afterwards, Secretary Qian Changzhao made the following political report: (1) The Five-Power Naval Conference has been open for a long time. The several difficulties of the conference have been explained in detail before the conference opened. Now, the difficulties have not been resolved, but the lack of sincerity of the countries' infighting has been clearly exposed. The situation of the conference in the past few weeks was dangerous and there was a possibility of breakdown. Later, the Japanese government accepted the US proposal on the tonnage of cruisers and submarines. Although some reservations were attached, the atmosphere among the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan has eased a lot. The agreement among the three countries can already be established. Some people say that Japan has been forced to negotiate unsuccessfully. The brothers believe that this is still Japan's cleverness. At this conference, the United Kingdom and the United States are at the center. These two countries have always been the most face-saving. If the conference completely fails, it will be very stimulating for Japan, France, and Italy. The combination of the United Kingdom and the United States will inevitably become more consolidated. France and Italy have more interests in the mainland. Japan is a maritime country and will inevitably be restrained everywhere in the future. Its acceptance of the US proposal is to befriend the United Kingdom and leave room for future maritime activities. The Japanese government can bend and stretch, which can be seen from this. According to the current situation, the naval conference will never completely fail, and the expression of the British and American authorities is very positive. As for France and Italy, they have never been willing to give in. On the one hand, because they do not have to compromise with the United Kingdom and the United States for the time being, on the other hand, because the United Kingdom and the United States may not pay much attention to their compromises. Whether the result is a five-power agreement or only a three-power agreement depends on the contact in the next few days. (2) Ge Feng does not know the people and does not know the country. Their elimination is of course very fast. What the central government is worried about now is not the war but the people. Years of natural and man-made disasters have exhausted their vitality. This time, Ge Feng's rebellion will directly and indirectly affect the people. Before the central government puts down the rebellion, the people will have to endure the pain temporarily in a short period of time. When the feudal warlords are destroyed, the central government can concentrate on construction, and the people's vitality can be gradually restored. As for the anti-rebellion army, it should always have the heart to love the people and do things to defend the people. This point has been described in detail in Jiang's book, and after the overall situation is settled, the only most important task of the central government is to reduce the burden and pain of the people. (3) The National Games closed the day before yesterday. The spirit of this conference was very good and the results were considerable. However, looking around our nation, it is still sluggish. Ordinary people generally have insufficient energy in their youth. Before the age of fifty, they have signs of aging. Most of them retire after the age of sixty, which is really ashamed compared to European and American countries. A few days ago, an American newspaper published the ages and photos of the judges of the US Supreme Court. The oldest one was eighty-nine years old and the youngest one was fifty-eight years old, and they were all energetic and showed no signs of aging. It is really admirable. Now, if our nation wants to cheer up, the first thing to do is to exercise our physique. Exercising our physique must be universal and persistent. Since the first Far East Games, there have been two shortcomings in exercising our physique. One is that it is not universal. Sports are almost limited to the academic community. The industrial and commercial circles rarely join. The reason is that the industrial and commercial circles are not very interested in sports, and there are no facilities in the society to give them opportunities to practice. One is that it is not persistent. It is often sporadic, so progress is not seen. In recent years, we have repeatedly lagged behind in competitions with Japan and the Philippines. The reason is that the athletes themselves do not work hard, and at the same time, the society is gradually indifferent to the Games. The above two shortcomings must be remedied. This matter is greatly related to the promotion of the nation. In addition to exercising our physique, sports can also cultivate a spirit of fair competition and integrity. A true athlete not only has skills, but also has self-cultivation. If this kind of self-cultivation is moved to the society, it can also create a very good atmosphere. Sports are so important. For the sake of promotion, the government has decided to hold the National Games in the capital next year. The budget is 500,000 yuan, and Lin Sen, Zhu Peide, He Yingqin, Wu Tiecheng, and Wei Daoming have been designated as members of the preparatory committee. (4) The German Industrial Inspection Group is coming to Beijing soon. The group has a total of eight people and is the representative of the German industrial circle. They are very knowledgeable and experienced in various industries. Two of them are very clear about the situation in our country. They are coming here with sincerity. It is not like ordinary inspection groups who attend several banquets and say a few irrelevant words and then leave. Since they are sincere, we should especially welcome them and have three hopes. Before their inspection, we are very willing to listen to their experiences of fighting hard in difficulties and hardships with the spirit of perseverance and fortitude in the past ten years, because that kind of spirit is worthy of emulation, and that kind of experience can be our model. This is the first hope. When they are inspecting, we are more willing to listen to their criticisms, as much as possible. We must know that all industries in our country are immature. Because they are immature, we should be more cautious during the period of laying the foundation. If we go down the wrong road, it is often a tiny mistake that leads to great errors. Therefore, if they criticize as much as possible at this moment, it is of great importance to the future of our country's industry. This is the second hope. After they inspect and return to Germany, they will definitely be more clear about the situation of our country's industry and more understanding of our country's government and people. In the future, if there is an opportunity, the two countries can seek mutual assistance on a completely equal footing. This is the third hope. With their sincerity this time, they will never disappoint us. At the same time, we should give them all kinds of convenience and opportunities to inspect and negotiate.</p>

Later, on the 19th, he received a telegram from Li Xuan, clearly stating that this action was to oppose Brigadier General Yan Zhongru personally and absolutely support the Commander-in-Chief (referring to He Jian). At the same time, he also asked his brother Li Zemin to come to the province to present the situation to He Jian and requested that the Li Regiment be separated from the Yan Brigade and reorganized into other troops. Only then did He Jian know that the disturbance in the Li Regiment was not as serious as the rumors outside. He immediately convened the military officers in the province and Yan Zhongru and others to discuss the handling methods. It was generally agreed that soldiers who acted freely and opposed officials were inappropriate. However, at this time of turmoil, in order to avoid the expansion of the matter, they had to temporarily approve the request and decided on a solution: (1) The Li Xuan Regiment will be reorganized into the 15th Division directly under He Jian, and the Wang Xianyi Supplement Regiment of the 15th Division will be incorporated into the Independent Fifth Brigade. (2) Li Zemin, Deputy Brigadier General of the Independent Fifth Brigade, can no longer cooperate with Yan. Cancel the title of Deputy Brigadier General and transfer him to be an advisor to the Fourth Route Army Headquarters. (3) The Li Xuan Regiment disbanded the special service battalion guns under the Yan Brigade in Baoqing and returned them to the Yan Brigade. The General Headquarters will find ways to supplement the guns insufficient for the Wang (Xianyi) Regiment. (4) The Yan Brigade's original Wan (Fangzhi) Regiment and the newly incorporated Wang (Xianyi) Regiment moved to Liuli to suppress bandits. The Li Xuan Regiment will still be stationed in Baoqing for reorganization and training. The above methods were satisfactory to both Yan Zhongru and Li Xuan. The situation in Changbao was resolved from then on. The telegram resumed on the 11th, and the Changbao car route continued to operate as usual. According to people from Baoqing, the order in Baoqing is as usual. Except for the sound of guns discovered on the evening of the 7th when the special service battalion guns were handed over, although people were very frightened afterwards, fortunately there was no disturbance.

<h3>Guangdong Army Defeats Communist Bandits in Beijiang</h3>
<p>▲ The Communist bandits' collection of military supplies in Nanxiong and their invasion of Renshi.</p>
<p>▲ The six regiments of the Guangdong Army entered Shao to suppress and recovered Shixing on the 7th.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the two Communist bandit forces, Peng Dehuai and Zhu De, entered and occupied Nanshi and Renhua, their purpose was to collect money and live the lives of bandits. Therefore, after arriving in Nanxiong, they used the name of Wei De to extort 100,000 yuan in military supplies from the Nanxiong Chamber of Commerce, limiting the payment to three days. The military supplies were collected by each store according to their household. The distribution method was divided into five grades: The first grade is silver shops, shipping agents, foreign goods companies, pawnshops, eight or nine businesses, etc., each household should pay 3,000 yuan. The second grade is silk and satin cloth foreign goods stores, each household should pay 2,000 yuan. The third grade is miscellaneous stores, each household should pay 1,500 yuan. The fourth grade is local goods merchants, each household should pay 1,000 yuan. The fifth grade is handicraft stores and small merchants, each household should pay 500 yuan. When the Communist bandits did not arrive in Nanxiong, the local wealthy had already moved away. The middle class who were unfortunate were forced to close down many of their shops due to this extortion. As soon as the Communist bandits arrived in Nanxiong, they first burned down the county party headquarters and searched for party headquarters personnel and many county government officials. It is heard that more than ten people were killed. Nanxiong County Magistrate Mei Yiqiang fled to Shao in advance and was spared. The Communist bandits also paid attention to propaganda. After the mail was checked, the back of the letters was covered with various slogans, no less than a hundred characters, all in red. On the day of the fall of Xionghou, Zhu De sent a bandit force to plunder Renhua. Therefore, in the afternoon of the third day, Renhua and Shixing were successively captured by the bandits. This is the story of the Communist bandits' ravaging the Xionghou area. At that time, the defense troops were weak and the bandit forces were vast, so the government army was forced to retreat and wait for reinforcements. In recent days, the provinces of Wu and Wu have sent large troops to concentrate in Shaoguan, including the Peng Linsheng Regiment of the 59th Division, the Wu Wenxian Regiment of the 63rd Division, the Chen Hanguang Department of the Headquarters Guard Regiment, and the Zeng Youren Department of the Third Independent Regiment. Recently, the Zhang Zhiying Department of the Fourth Independent Regiment was also transferred north. The Zhang Regiment took the Fu'an ship on the 6th and returned to the provincial capital from the Haikoubu of the South Road, and transferred to the Yuehan car to Shao. The Eighth Route Army Headquarters appointed Wu Wenxian as the Commander of the Beijiang Bandit Suppression. Wu has selected the former North District Post-Disaster Public Office in Shao as the Beijiang Bandit Suppression Headquarters, preparing to lead the Beijiang armies to suppress the Zhu Peng Communist bandits. After the regiments concentrated in Shaoguan, Wu immediately held a bandit suppression conference in Shao. The regiments then set off in separate ways. It is estimated that the Wu Xian Zeng Youren Departments concentrated in Jilongxu, 95 miles above Shao, to block the Communist bandits in Shixing from going south. The Chen Hanguang Peng Linsheng Regiments concentrated in Zhoutian, 85 miles above Shao, to control the Communist bandits in Renhua from rushing out. The road from Jilongxu to Shixing is commanded by Wu Wenxian, and the road from Zhoutian to Renhua is commanded by Chen Hanguang, with Zhang Zhiying as the reserve tunnel, and thousands of local militias from Qujiang, Renhua, and Shixing are gathered to cooperate in attacking in separate ways. Shao City is maintained by the Yi Wenwei Department of the 9th Gendarmerie Team. Recent news from the front, on the 5th, the road from Jilonghao to attack Shixing has begun to contact the Communist bandits in Jiangkou (Jiangkou is 20 miles away from Shixing). After a fierce battle until noon on the 6th, Chen Hanguang drew a battalion to help. The Communist bandits could not support it, and the 100,000 yuan extorted by the Communist bandits in Nanxiong had arrived, and they had no intention to fight. They withdrew from Shixing on the 7th. However, the authorities were afraid that they would defect to the Dongjiang River, and have telegraphed the Mao Weishou Brigade stationed in the upper reaches of the Dongjiang River to quickly send tunnels to Lianping to intercept. At the same time, the Jin Handing Division of Southern Jiangxi was telegraphed to order the Tang Brigade Yang Yingzhi Regiment and the Zhang Brigade Xiao Xixian Regiment to go south to encircle the Communist bandits behind Nanxiong, so as to encircle and annihilate the Communist bandits in the short term.

<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Northeast Infantry, Artillery and Air Force joint exercise began on the 1st of this month along the Hun River. In order to enable the exercise personnel to experience the real situation of the battlefield and understand the coordinated actions of the various units during the attack, Commander Zhang Xueliang and Deputy Commander Wang Yizhe of the Commander's Headquarters specially conducted live ammunition shooting at the Beidaying shooting range at 10:00 am on the 10th (originally scheduled for the 8th due to wind and snow). On that day, the gale was like a roar, but the guests who came to visit were still very enthusiastic. In addition to military, political, academic, and business dignitaries, Fang Benren, the central representative stationed in Shenyang, and Men Zhizhong, the representative of Feng Yuxiang, also arrived on time. Students who went to visit included Tongze and Peiying schools. A shed was set up facing north in the field, with two scissor-shaped binoculars on it. In front of the shed, trenches crisscrossed and three groups of artillery cover bodies were set up. After Zhang Xueliang arrived at the scene, Deputy Commander (First Brigade Commander) Wang Yizhe of the Commander's Headquarters saluted and reported, and immediately sounded the signal to issue orders. For a time, the messenger soldiers wearing green disguises ran back and forth, and the officers and soldiers in the trenches issued orders to measure and write reports. Senior officials and guests held binoculars to watch, and the situation was extremely busy. Twelve large mountain guns were lined up in the field. In the yellow sand, the cannons roared, and the smoke and dust rose in the distance where the shells landed, giving the impression of being on the battlefield. The exercise did not end until 3:00 pm. In this exercise, the infantry research class students of the First Brigade were the infantry exercise commanders, the First Brigade infantry research class soldiers' team and the First Brigade headquarters troops were the exercise troops, the artillery research class students of the Jiangwutang were the artillery exercise commanders, the artillery research class teaching team was the exercise troops, the aviation research class students of the Jiangwutang were the aviation exercise commanders, the aviation research class guidance team was the exercise troops, the engineering research class students of the Jiangwutang were the engineering exercise commanders, and the engineering research class teaching team was the engineering exercise troops.

The above hostages have now been handed over by the regimental headquarters to the Kunshan First District Office, awaiting their families to claim them.</p>
<p>▲Circumstances of the Firefight  On the 12th of this month, after the Kunshan Camp Commander Kuang learned of the discovery of a large gang of lake bandits at Xia Xiongtian (i.e., Xia Xintian), he personally led two infantry companies and one machine gun company, together with nine police boats from the 12th Water Police Team, and set off towards Yangcheng Lake. Later, upon reaching Bacheng, considering it to be a vital waterway to Taicang, Captain Li led three police boats to stay in Bacheng to guard the area. The remaining six police boats followed Commander Kuang forward and indeed found hundreds of bandits at Xia Xiongtian, whereupon they opened fire. At that time, the lake bandits were on the west side, and the military police were on the east side. The government troops then used machine guns to strafe them. After an hour, the bandits began to collapse and fled towards Lianhua Dou in the rear. The military police pursued closely. The bandits fought and fled. When they reached Lianhua Dou (this place borders Yangcheng Village, separated by about three miles of water, belonging to Wuxian County, about eighteen miles from Bacheng), the bandits, seeing that they could not escape by water in the rear, turned around and pounced on the military police. However, the bandits' bullets were exhausted, and they stubbornly resisted in hand-to-hand combat, eventually using their gun barrels to strike at the military police. The military police then fixed bayonets onto their rifles and stabbed at the bandits. At that time, some bandits jumped into the water and drowned, corpses lay everywhere, and blood flowed like rivers. Some swam away, and others scattered and fled into the fields. All sorts of chaotic situations were endless. Until about 4 p.m., after a total of six hours of pursuit, only seven bandit boats escaped (one more was later intercepted by the water police patrol in Weiting). On the hostage side, a small number were killed by stray bullets. It was also heard that the bandit leader Xie Laoyue had also been killed. As for Mao Zilong and others, after the battle of Weijingtang, they had already taken the looted precious gold, silver, foreign currency, and ornaments and fled to Shanghai in advance. That night, Camp Commander Kuang and others used steamships to tow back the captured bandits, bandit boats, bandit weapons, and rescued hostages, returning in triumph.</p>
<p>▲Overview of the Search for Remaining Bandits The day after the great battle of Weijingtang (i.e., during the fierce battle of Lianhua Dou on the 12th), more than ten bandit boats were also discovered on the Yangcheng Lake near Wushenjing, two or three miles away. The 11th Water Public Security Patrol continued to pursue them. The bandits did not have time to disembark and swam away. Afterwards, the 9th Public Security Watch Post of Wushenjing searched Shen Dianqiao and found a suspect named Zhang Jinru. A handkerchief, a wallet containing seventeen yuan in silver and 1,480 copper coins, and a pair of gold-plated earrings were found on his person. According to his confession, he was 26 years old, a native of Wujiang, who had been fishing for a living. On the twelfth day of the second lunar month of this year, while fishing in Hongqiao Port, he was captured by bandits and forced to row boats for them. There were three others who were captured at the same time, and the other two had already escaped. He was transferred by the Lumulu 8th Public Security Bureau to the County Bureau for interrogation. At that time, the Mu Public Security Bureau dispatched to search and arrest in four places. Two bandits were captured at Xinglong Bridge. Nine yuan in silver were found on one, and eight yuan on the other. After being brought to the bureau, one confessed that his name was Guo Wenming, 24 years old, a native of Suqian, a farmer, who came from Kunshan to Suzhou and got lost. The other, named Zhang Shoucheng, 35 years old, a native of Qingjiang, a farmer, came from Shanghai. The rest of their words were evasive, and neither admitted to being a fugitive bandit. Also, the Lumulu Security Corps squad leader searched a bandit at Nanqiao, wearing a foreign yarn short shirt inside and a velvet rope vest outside, his whole body was wet, and he had no long clothes. He confessed that his name was Qi Wenkui, 25 years old, a native of Suqian, who made a living by pulling carts and came from Shanghai. He also did not admit to being a fugitive bandit. He was sent to the 8th Bureau and transferred to the County Bureau for detention pending interrogation. Also, the Chenmu 13th Public Security Bureau reported to the county government today (14th) that they had found two abandoned bandit rifles, both stamped with the imprint of Maoqiao, Jinshan County, and 206 bullets, and 25 lead bullets from Tianmen. As for the bandits intercepted by the Youjing County Police 3rd Squad 1st Team the day before, one was named Miao Zhichuan (24 years old, a native of Haizhou), one was named Xu Magao (37 years old, a native of Huai'an), and one was named Liu Jinbiao (35 years old, a native of Suqian). They also rescued four hostages: one was named Yuan Yangru (40 years old, a native of Taiping Bridge), one was named Ni Xiaoshan (33 years old, a native of Wujiang), one was named Pang Ashou (38 years old, a native of Qingpu), and one was named Yan Ashui (27 years old, a native of Zhujiajiao). The team's firefight lasted for more than five hours, consuming a total of 1,585 bullets. Also, a wounded bandit named Gao Zi'an, 26 years old, a native of Huaiyin, was found inside the Weiting Mountain Cave by the 9th Public Security Bureau. According to the guerrilla team's verification, the bandit's real name was Zhang Shaohua, the leader of the Haizhou gang and a subordinate of the bandit leader Mao Zilong. The previous team leader, Li Guobin, was shot and killed by this bandit, but this has not yet been confirmed. Furthermore, the county government reported today, based on a report from Wu Bozhen, the 8th District Chief of Nanbeiqiao, that the Hexing steamboat, which operates from Shanghai and was going to Shanghai for boat inspection, departed from Wuxi and, while passing through Caoge Dawanli, was suddenly encountered by seventeen bandit boats that opened fire in an attempt to rob it. Fortunately, the captain of the boat managed to escape. Afterwards, it encountered a cargo ship from Shanghai and entrusted it to report to Dangkou and Huangdai to set up a blockade. Meanwhile, District Chief Wu, after receiving the news, also ordered the Li Security Corps to join the land and water police to investigate the bandits' whereabouts in the Nanqiao area. At the same time, the county government also received a report from Zhou Zhaolin, the 7th District Chief of Xiangcheng, that the sound of gunfire was very intense in Youjing yesterday afternoon around 1 p.m. It was later learned that the 2nd Battalion of the 25th Regiment had dispatched a team to join the 12th Kunshan Water Police Team and the 13th Changshu Team, as well as four warships, to continue searching for and suppressing fugitive bandits in Xizhu Village, Lianhua Dou, and other places. The firing continued until about 4 p.m., when the remaining bandits, unable to withstand the pressure, had fled towards Maota.</p>
<p>Another dispatch stated that in the battle of Xintian Lianhua Dou, more than eighty bandits were killed, thirty-four hostages were rescued, five bandits were captured, thirteen bandit boats were sunk, seven Mauser pistols and more than ten rifles were seized. The Haizhou gang led by Zhang Zhaohua has been almost completely wiped out. The bandit leader Zhang Zhaohua had no choice but to abandon everything, take gold and silver ornaments, and flee far away. However, Mao Zilong's unit is still taking the opportunity to steal in the Taihu area. It is said that the Pudong gang has also scattered and fled. Commander Hu has ordered the anti-bandit military police to fiercely suppress the long-standing bandits in various villages, achieving great victories. There are no large gangs of bandits left in the territories of Wuxian, Kunshan, and Wujiang counties. Only small groups of lake bandits remain, wandering aimlessly, with their roots not completely eradicated. Today, he specially ordered the county magistrates of the three counties to lead the Public Security Bureau and district chiefs to implement joint defense, conduct strict searches, and maintain public order in accordance with the anti-bandit plan.</p>

At 9 p.m., the bandits held weapons and searched house by house, looting fifteen families in a row and setting fire to more than thirty families, causing losses of about 50,000 to 60,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Taizhou</h3>
<p>Details of Bandit Suppression It has been reported that in recent days, more than a thousand bandits have gathered in Tiantai, Beishan, Tongbai Palace, and other places, wearing Zhejiang Red Army symbols on their chests. The situation is very rampant. Wang Delong, the camp commander of the 1st Battalion of the 5th Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Government Security Team stationed in Ninghai, learned of this and immediately led two companies of troops to suppress them. After three days and nights of attack, the bandits could not hold out and fled to Xinchang. It is estimated that dozens of bandits were killed, dozens of guns, one cannon, and two flags were seized.</p>
<p>Large Fire on Dongsheng Street A fire suddenly broke out at Songyunge Paper Store on Haimen Sheng Street, Linhai, the day before yesterday. In an instant, the fire blazed into the sky and could not be extinguished. The fire brigade rushed to the scene and tried their best to put it out. It was extinguished after about an hour. It is estimated that more than thirty stores were burned down, causing losses of about 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Business Wheel Freight and Passenger Account Donation Determined by the Company The inland small business wheels operating in Jiaxing last month received a provincial order forwarded by the county magistrate to collect a passenger and freight donation of 10%, which has been collected with the bureau's ticket, and forwarded to the county for transfer to the province for use. Now, each wheel company feels that it is too much trouble to collect by ticket, and that adding 10% to passenger tickets is also a major obstacle to the economy of passengers. Therefore, Yongji, China Merchants, and other ten wheel companies have proposed to pay a total of 200 yuan per month for passenger and freight account donations, and the passenger and freight tickets will also be increased by 2, 3, or 4 cents each, in order to facilitate the operation and relieve business difficulties. They have jointly written a letter to the Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the county government for approval. It is now learned that the Finance Bureau of the County Government feels that 200 yuan per month seems too little. A meeting of managers of each wheel bureau was specially convened a few days ago. As a result, each bureau recognized a total of 250 yuan per month as account donations. The county has now prepared a table of account donations collected by each wheel bureau and submitted it to the province for approval.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Bandits Intercept Night Boats Three night boats from Kunji, Miao Ji, Hong Ji, etc., which departed from Sian to Huzhou, were intercepted by bandits who spoke with a Yu accent on the afternoon of the 11th, passing through the junction of Niudian Bridge and Tangkou. At that time, it was already late at night. Suddenly, seven bandits were seen on the shore, firing a shot and shouting to stop. Each boat stopped upon hearing the sound. One bandit held a white Brownin on the shore as a lookout. The remaining six unarmed bandits each held a flashlight and arbitrarily searched each boat, robbing the passengers of all their clothes and silver, and the boatmen of the rice they were carrying. They went west. And Hong Ji's boat had already been completely robbed of its cargo by several bandits halfway from Huzhou to Si'an the day before. Unfortunately, it was robbed again on its return trip to Huzhou the next day.</p>
<p>Headquarters Executes Two Bandits The famous long-term bandit Shen Ashou and the key criminal Zhang Shilin, who privately transported guns for the bandits, were arrested. After interrogation by the Military Law Office of the Headquarters, the bandits confessed without reservation. Therefore, at around 5 p.m. yesterday, the headquarters verified the identities of the two criminals, escorted them to the South School Ground, and executed them by shooting.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Cao'e River to Be Dredged The Cao'e River has a total area of 13,000 square li. The riverbed is silted up. Zhang Jingxu, the county magistrate of Shangyu, has formulated a plan and submitted it to the Construction Conference for approval. The Construction Department has submitted it to the department for detailed discussion. It is said that the required funds will be allocated from the Construction Public Bonds.</p>
<h3>Mingguang</h3>
<p>Security Corps Busts Kidnappers The youngest son of Chen Xiantang of Chen Wanshun Silk Fabric Store in Nantao, this town, was kidnapped on the 22nd of last month by his servant Cai San and other bandits. At that time, investigations were carried out everywhere, but there was no trace. After the Security Corps learned that the bandits were hiding in Shangzhu Village, more than seventy li north of Mingguang, Captain Zhou led a team in the rain last night (11th) to rescue the hostage. He also captured two bandits, Zhu Wantang and Zhu Wanjun, on the spot, and brought them back for interrogation. The criminals confessed to being bandits and were immediately sent to the county for prosecution.</p>

<h3>Implementation Plan for Adult Literacy Education</h3>
<p>Circumstances of Compilation and</p>
<p>Key Points by Zhong Lingxiu</p>
<p>According to the most recent survey, China's population is approximately 430 million, but the illiterate population accounts for 80%, roughly 300 million people. Among these, excluding school-age children subject to compulsory education, children under six years old (both around 40 million), elderly people over fifty years old (50 million), and the blind, deaf, mute, disabled, and those with mental or neurological disorders (about one million), there remain over 200 million people, accounting for about half of the total population. These are all young and adult individuals who are the sound members of the nation and the backbone of society. During this period of political tutelage, if we want to train these large numbers of ignorant people to understand Party principles, exercise the four powers, and possess basic national knowledge and life skills, then the only true way is to actively implement literacy education.</p>
<p>Therefore, in June of the 18th year of the Republic (1929), the First Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee, in discussing the proposal for rectifying and developing national education, resolved the following two cases: (1) "Vigorously implement national compulsory education and adult literacy education, with the planning, regulations, and implementation procedures to be formulated by the Ministry of Education by the end of September of the 18th year, approved by the Central Executive Committee, and actively implemented. The entire plan must be realized by the end of the 23rd year of the Republic." (2) "Regarding measures for rectifying and developing education, the government should immediately convene a national education conference in the spring of the 19th year, organized by the Ministry of Education. Before the conference is convened, the Ministry of Education should immediately organize an Education Program Drafting Committee, based on the Party's political platform, resolutions on education from previous National Congresses, Central Plenary Sessions, Standing Committee meetings, etc., and referring to the resolutions of the National Education Conference convened by the University Council in the 17th year, to create a program for implementing the rectification and development of national education. This program must include the entire education budget. The organization of the Education Program Drafting Committee will be decided by the Central Political Council, and it must be established and begin work within July of the 18th year."</p>
<p>After receiving this order in July of the 18th year, the Ministry of Education, in August, hired over fifty education experts as members to establish the Education Program Drafting Committee and conduct group discussions. Those who were hired as specialized committee members for the Adult Literacy Education Group were Meng Xiancheng, Chen Jianxiao, Zhong Lingxiu, Gu Shusen, Yu Qingtang, Zhao Mian, Jiang Hengyuan, and seven others, with Meng Xiancheng as the director. However, although the members of this group were appointed, they were each occupied with other matters and it was not easy to convene meetings for discussion. Moreover, because adult literacy education fell under the purview of the first section of the Department of Social Education, and I was in charge of the section's affairs, I first drafted the general outline of this plan as follows: (1) Explanation of the Outline, (2) Estimation of the Number of People Requiring Adult Literacy Education, (3) Types of Literacy Schools, (4) School Buildings and Equipment, (5) Teacher Training, (6) Funding Sources and Fundraising Methods, (7) Timing for Implementing Compulsory Adult Literacy Education, and the Implementation Procedures by Year. After the draft was completed, it was sent to Chen Jianxiao, Director of the Department of Social Education, for review. Then, Mr. Gu Liangjie, Director Chen Jianxiao, and I took on the task of drafting the details. In September, the drafts were gradually completed, and dozens of copies were printed and distributed to the specialized committee members of adult literacy education to solicit opinions. After a month, those who submitted supplementary opinions included Mr. Meng Xiancheng, Jiang Hengyuan, Zhao Mian, and Tao Zhihing. On November 5th, it was submitted to the Second Standing Committee Meeting of the Education Program Drafting Committee for discussion. It was decided that this program would be carried out in two steps: (1) National Literacy Training, (2) Vocational Training. It was also decided to invite the original drafters, Director Chen, and myself, along with Zhu Jingnong, Tao Zhihing, and Mr. Gu Shusen, to jointly review it on the morning of November 6th. At that time, the principles of civic literacy training proposed by Mr. Tao were considered and revised, and the general outline of vocational training was drafted by Mr. Gu Shusen. On the same afternoon, it was submitted to the Third Standing Committee Meeting for discussion. The two principles were revised separately and then handed over to the original drafters, Director Chen and myself, to incorporate everyone's opinions and compile them together. At the end of December, the draft was completed and sent to Minister Jiang for review. Minister Jiang believed that the cost was too high and the state's financial resources might not be able to bear it. Therefore, it was decided to first focus on achieving national literacy training within six years of political tutelage, and to continue to conduct vocational training after literacy training was implemented. By proceeding in two steps, the state's financial resources would be easier to bear. Therefore, the title of the original plan was changed to "Preliminary Plan for Implementing Adult Literacy Education," and its content was divided into seven items: (1) Principles, (2) Current Urgent Issues, (3) Methods for Enrolling Out-of-School Adults in Literacy Classes and Training Teachers, (4) Methods for Increasing School Buildings and Equipment, (5) Budget and Fundraising Methods, (6) Methods for Compiling National Literacy Teaching Materials, (7) Procedures for Implementing Universalization, (8) Scheduled Compulsory Period and Post-Compulsory Assessment. The manuscript was completed and revised by mid-January, and dozens of copies were printed and sent by the Ministry of Education to the Executive Yuan, then to the National Government, and finally to the Central Political Council for review. This is the process of the second draft and submission of this plan to the Central Committee for review.</p>
<p>However, it has been two months since it was submitted to the Central Committee for review, and it has not yet been returned. The period for the National Education Conference is not far off, and when the entire improved education program is submitted, this plan will also be included to ensure its finalization. The original draft has also been slightly added to and deleted. This is also the process of submitting this plan and other complete education programs to the Central Committee for review again. In addition, although the second part, vocational training, is planned to be implemented after the first part, literacy training, is completed, if local financial and human resources are available to conduct them simultaneously, and if there is a need in this area, it can be continued. Naturally, it can be carried out simultaneously or gradually. Therefore, the vocational training plan must also be drafted. Therefore, after drafting, it will be included in the second item of the improved social education plan, so that it can be fully discussed at the National Education Conference to achieve perfection. This also needs to be explained in passing.</p>
<p>Speaking of the content of this plan, it can be simply divided into two major parts: (1) National Literacy Training, (2) Vocational Training. The former, if implemented according to the plan, can rescue all illiterate adults in the country within six years, truly achieving the goal of everyone being able to read, study, read newspapers, write letters, calculate, and keep accounts. The latter, if continued to be implemented according to the plan, will allow farmers, workers, women, and others to enjoy vocational training separately, naturally providing them with many necessary knowledge and skills in their lives and occupations, and increasing their various production capacities. In short, this case, if fully implemented, can indeed enrich people's lives, support social survival, develop the national economy, continue the nation's life, achieve national independence, universal economic rights, and develop people's livelihood, in order to promote the great harmony of the world. However, there are still many incomplete aspects of the plan, and the responsibility for supplementing and correcting them naturally rests with the members of this National Education Conference.</p>
<p>Because the National Education Conference is held today, and the Shen Bao newspaper has a special education issue, I would like to describe the process of drafting this case and its key points in order to expand the scope, and to respond to the entrustment.</p>
<h3>A Comparison of the Second Conference and the Previous Conference by Wu Yan Yin</h3>
<p>What are the differences between this National Education Conference's origins, organization, and proposals and the National Education Conference convened by the University Council in May of the 17th year? How much of the resolutions of the first National Education Conference has been implemented now? Are the unimplemented ones listed in the current proposals? What are the differences in the level of detail between the contents of the two proposals? These are all questions that the education community urgently wants to know. Now I would like to briefly talk about these questions.</p>
<h3>(I) Origins</h3>
<p>The first conference was convened shortly after the establishment of the Nanjing National Government. At that time, the Three Principles of the People's education was about to be implemented and the education administration had not yet been unified. The President of the University Council, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, and many university committee members believed that it was necessary to hold a National Education Conference. Therefore, the first conference was initiated by the University Council. This conference was convened based on the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee and was initiated by the Central Committee. The Central Committee believed that education was important during the period of political tutelage and that a conference should be convened to solicit the opinions of the national education community to create a complete education program and a complete education budget. Therefore, in terms of origins, the two conferences each had its own needs and its own intentions, and they were truly different.</p>
<h3>(II) Organization</h3>
<p>For the first conference, each province sent two members, each special municipality sent one member, and each government agency sent one delegate. In addition, there were eighteen expert members, the President, Vice President, and Secretary-General of the University Council, and the heads of various departments and counselors, totaling ten people. There were also seven or eight members of the University Committee attending. The total number was seventy or eighty people. This time, the number of provinces, special municipalities, and government agencies has increased. Therefore, although the quota is the same as last time, the total number has increased significantly. The number of expert members has also increased by twelve compared to last time. The number of department heads, deputy heads, directors, counselors, and the Ministry of Education is about the same as last time, but the presidents of national universities have replaced the university committee members to attend as attendees instead of attending members. Therefore, the total number of members is as high as one hundred and thirty-three people. What is also obviously the same is that the majority of the previous members were academic experts and university professors. The primary education community, the overseas Chinese education community, and the Mongolian-Tibetan education community did not participate. This time, in addition to three or four primary education experts, each province also has a city or county education bureau chief or city or county education section chief who is in charge of primary education administration. There are also several overseas Chinese education experts and Mongolian-Tibetan education experts. The conference period was ten days last time and seven days this time.</p>
<h3>(III) Preparation</h3>
<p>The organization of the preparatory committee was roughly the same for both times, but there were a few differences: (1) The number of preparatory members was smaller last time, and a few people bore too heavy a burden. This time, the number of people is larger, and if they are combined, there is a joint office, and if they are divided, they each have their own responsibilities, so that the affairs they bear will not have the disadvantage of being too light or too heavy. (2) The preparations were more complete and detailed. All matters such as reception, editing documents, and affairs that could be prepared in advance were prepared in advance. This is a natural result, because this is the second time, and many people have prepared for the first conference and already have a lot of experience. However, the period was rushed, and there were still many things that could not be handled in a relaxed manner, and the member reception area was too far from the venue and it was not easy to take care of it. This is where it is not as good as the first conference.</p>
<h3>(IV) Proposals</h3>
<p>The two proposals differ the most. This is the most valuable comparison. Now I will briefly describe the more important differences between the proposals in general terms below:</p>
<h3>(I) Different Origins</h3>
<p>Although the previous proposals were first formed by the Six Proposal Committees and prepared in advance, in addition to the proposals prepared by the Proposal Committees, there were also proposals freely submitted by various education institutions and proposals submitted by individual members and education personnel. Even the proposals prepared by the Proposal Committees were mostly submitted in the name of individual members. This time, the proposals were compiled by the Education Program Drafting Committee established by the Ministry of Education, based on the educational purpose of the Republic of China and its implementation strategy, as well as the resolutions on education made by the Central Committee in the past and the resolutions of the previous National Education Conference. They were submitted to the Central Political Council for review and approval, and were submitted without using individual names at all. There are no other proposals that can be submitted by various education institutions and individuals in the education community. Therefore, the previous proposals were produced by the free thoughts of individuals in the education community, and this time the proposals were formulated by the Central Committee and produced by the unified will of the government.</p>
<h3>(II) Different Methods</h3>
<p>Because of the different origins, the</p>
<p>The previous proposals were fragmented and mixed, and this time the proposals were whole and pure. Last time, each proposed his own case, so the opinions were very divergent. Some were repetitive, some were conflicting, some were too detailed, and some were completely lacking. This time, it is a systematic program, so it is consistent from beginning to end, there is no repetition, there are few conflicts, there are no too detailed places, and it is more complete and not lacking. In terms of form, last time there were four hundred and two cases, and this time there is only one case. Last time, each case had its own reasons and methods, and some even only had reasons and no methods. This time, it is divided into chapters and sections, listing the methods and omitting the reasons, and some do not explain any reasons at all.</p>
<h3>(III) Different Classifications</h3>
<p>For the convenience of reviewing the previous proposals, they were divided into twelve groups: the Three Principles of the People's education, education administration, education funding, general education, social education, higher education, physical education and military education, vocational education, science education, art education, publications and library improvement, and private schools. This time, the program is divided into a preliminary plan for implementing compulsory education, a preliminary plan for implementing adult literacy education, a plan for establishing various levels and types of teacher training institutions, a plan for improving primary education, a plan for improving secondary education, a plan for improving higher education, a plan for improving social education, a plan for improving and developing overseas Chinese education, a plan for implementing Mongolian-Tibetan education, and a total budget for the entire program, a total of ten chapters. Comparing the two, except for higher education and social education, the rest are different. This time, the program says very little about the organization of the education administration itself, and the administrative methods of each part of education are included in various programs, so they are not listed as a category. In addition to a certain amount of "total budget for the entire program" for education funding, how to raise funds was originally not the responsibility of the education community. Improving private schools is an administrative method in ordinary education and higher education. Physical education and military education, science education, art education, and publications are either related to the curriculum or to administrative facilities. Vocational education is a type of secondary education, and libraries are one end of social education or school education, so this time they are not listed as a category. Originally, improving primary education could include compulsory education, and improving social education could include adult literacy education, and improving primary, secondary, and higher education could include teacher training, and there is no need to create another chapter. So the reason for listing them separately is that the Central Committee pays special attention to popularizing education (that is, compulsory education and adult literacy education), and teacher training is most related to popularizing education. As for overseas Chinese education and Mongolian-Tibetan education, they have their own special points, so they are also listed as separate categories. In short, the classification of the two proposals is more systematic this time than last time.</p>
<h3>(IV) Different Contents</h3>

<p>A. Regarding reorganizing the normal school system and paying attention to training rural education teachers (incorporated into the plan for establishing various levels and types of teacher training institutions, changing the content)</p>

<p>M. Regarding using school education to supplement social education (same as above)</p>
<p>N. Regarding promoting vocational education and reorganizing industrial and commercial schools (incorporated into the plan for improving secondary and higher education)</p>
<p>In short, the previous proposals were fragmented and incomplete, and the methods were not very appropriate. This time, the program has more detailed regulations. Now, the most relevant ones are divided as follows:</p>
<h3>(I) Compulsory Education Plan</h3>
<p>Last time, it was scheduled to be fully realized in ten years, and it was not thought that China had 40 million out-of-school children, requiring 1.4 million teachers, 1 million classrooms, and 280 million yuan in funding each year. There was also no method for setting up schools in stages, training teachers, and increasing classrooms. This time, the program proposes to calculate all kinds of problems in a comprehensive plan in detail, and the deadline for full realization is set at 20 years.</p>
<h3>(II) Adult Literacy Education Plan</h3>
<p>The previous proposal to reduce illiteracy stipulated that people aged 15 to 50 must receive four months of literacy education, with people's reading books, algorithms, etc. as the subject matter, which was very simple. This time, the program plans to enable more than 202 million people to receive education in the Three Principles of the People's Thousand Character Lesson and other reading, literacy, and the use of four powers in stages within six years, train 135,000 people, and require 112,470 classrooms, requiring a total of 283.4 million yuan in funding. Moreover, it provides detailed regulations on how to train teachers, increase school buildings and equipment, budget funds, edit teaching materials, implement procedures, and compulsory methods.</p>
<h3>(III) Teacher Training Plan</h3>
<p>The previous proposal to reorganize the normal school system and train rural education teachers had very simple content. This time, the program specifies the completion deadline (five years), degree, term, setup method, course outline, internship method, treatment and service, secondary school teacher training method, vocational subject teacher training method, etc. in detail.</p>
<h3>(IV) Primary Education Improvement Plan</h3>
<p>Although there were many proposals last time, they were biased and incomplete. There were more on curriculum standards, and there were a few on teacher treatment and training, but they were all preliminary outlines. This time, the program specifies everything related to primary education in detail, such as the establishment of elementary schools and kindergartens, funding, building equipment, teachers and staff, length of study, class organization, training and education fees, curriculum, health education, and counseling system, without any omissions. In the sections on curriculum and teacher treatment, there are further methods.</p>
<h3>(V) Secondary Education Improvement Plan</h3>
<p>The previous proposals on secondary education were also biased and incomplete, and also</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Curriculum standards occupy the majority. This time, the program, such as the connection method between universities and elementary schools, the establishment standards of secondary schools, funding budgets, scientific experiments, the improvement of the degree of high school general subjects, the practice of vocational subjects, and the reorganization of private secondary schools, all points that the secondary education hall should pay attention to are specified in detail. Compared with the last time, it is also much more complete.</p>
<h3>(VI) Higher Education Improvement Plan</h3>
<p>The previous proposals on higher education, in addition to sending students abroad, holding graduation examinations, and awarding degrees, almost none remained. This time, the program has methods to enrich content, promote universities, improve student levels, and seek employment opportunities for graduates, methods for sending students abroad, methods for establishing specialized schools, and funding budgets, etc. Compared with the last time, it is also much more complete.</p>
<h3>(7) Plan to Improve Social Education</h3>
<p>The previous proposals regarding social education were somewhat numerous, but also incomplete. This time, the key points of the plan include implementing a general outline for supplementary education in agriculture, industry, commerce, and vocational skills; establishing and promoting major social institutions; preparing special education and rehabilitation education; improving customs and promoting public entertainment; cooperative measures between social education and school education; and budget estimates, which are much more detailed.</p>
<h3>(8) Plan to Improve and Develop Overseas Chinese Education</h3>
<p>The previous proposals on this topic were few. This time, all the resolutions of the previous Overseas Chinese Education Conference of the Central Training Department have been fully incorporated, and many measures have been supplemented, so this plan feels very complete. Objectives, institutions (administrative, educational associations, etc.), organizational funding design matters, school education, and social education all have detailed measures.  The entire plan for overseas Chinese education is almost comprehensive.</p>
<h3>(9) Plan to Implement Mongolian and Tibetan Education</h3>
<p>The previous proposals on this topic were the fewest, only two, and they were both very general. This time, there are measures for administration, general education, higher education, and social education, as well as budget estimates, and compilation of libraries, etc., almost all of which are specially added, and all are very substantial.</p>
<h3>(10) General Budget</h3>
<p>The last time there was none at all, this time it is specially added. Because this time it is a complete plan, the total budget for the next twenty years should be included. It is estimated that more than 70 million is needed in the first year, and then 20 million is added each year, up to more than 490 million in the twentieth year. All education funds are included. After reading the above, you can know the differences between the two meetings, but this does not mean that the two meetings have any advantages or disadvantages. It's just that the last meeting seemed to be a preliminary creation, and this meeting seems to be a modification. Since there was the last meeting, there should be this meeting.  Since the last meeting was like that, this meeting should be like this. They are exactly opposite and complement each other.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be explained that the proposals of this meeting are most lacking in two points: first, there is a lack of further implementation plans for the Three Principles of the People education; second, matters related to educational administration, such as administrative organization and administrative staff training, are almost non-existent, but it is said that there are remedial measures. Regarding administration, the Ministry of Education intends to convene the heads of education departments in each province, the heads of education bureaus in each special city (or their representatives), and their designated personnel, to hold a one- or two-day educational administration conference to specifically discuss educational administration issues and allow all members to freely propose ideas. Regarding the Three Principles of the People education, the Central Training Department intends to solicit opinions from all members in writing for reference.</p>
<p>As for this plan, there are naturally many shortcomings, which are not within the scope of this topic, so I won't say much now.</p>
<h3>Summary of the Plan (1)</h3>
<p>The Plan to Improve National Education is rich in content and more than 100,000 words long. It was very inconvenient during the conference discussion, so the reasons were removed from each plan and compiled into a summary of the plan. It was printed and distributed to all members at the meeting for discussion. The original text of the summary of each case is recorded below in installments.</p>
<h3>▲Summary of the Preliminary Plan for Implementing Adult Supplementary Education</h3>
<p>(1) General Outline</p>
<p>1.  Objectives: To provide a kind of short-term school education with supplementary characteristics to the unemployed people of the country, both young and adult, and to complete literacy training within the six-year period of political tutelage.</p>
<p>2.  Principles: (A) To enable the people to have the ability to read and write and use the four powers with the least money and the shortest period of time; (B) To start with group people first, and gradually extend to scattered people, starting from rich places and gradually extending to poor places; (C) The age of those who receive national literacy training should range from 12 to 50 years old; (D) Illiterate people have the obligation to learn, and literate people have the obligation to teach; (E) There should be very strict assessment in administration; (F) After establishing a foundation, there should be opportunities for continued progress.</p>
<p>3.  Current Problems (A) How to enable the 320 million out-of-school people in the country to be literate and do arithmetic; (B) How to cultivate 135,000 teachers needed in six years; (C) How to increase 112,447 teaching treasures; (D) How to raise more than 283.4 million yuan in funds.</p>
<h3>(2) Measures for Unenrolled Adults to Enter Supplementary Education and Cultivate Teachers</h3>
<p>1.  Illiterate members of small family shops and other small-scale organizations are guided by literate members living together, which is called the National Literacy Office. The nearby elementary school assesses the results. National Literacy Schools are set up in the army, factories, prisons, and all institutions, or in places with dozens or more illiterate people.</p>
<p>2.  The teachers of National Literacy Schools are provided by county-level senior elementary schools, county-level normal schools, provincial normal schools, military academies, and secondary schools or above, which attach training classes for teachers to all students of each school for at least a three-week training, and recruit private school teachers for a two-month training. Both can train about 550,000 people, which is enough for rotation.</p>
<p>3.  Teachers in the National Literacy Offices are filled by about 80 million elementary school students and literate adults, each receiving two months of training from the station schools and improved private schools.</p>
<p>4.  The Ministry of Education establishes the Central National Literacy Instructor Training Institute, using the National Literacy Movement in the capital as a pilot and training center, recruiting students with a high school level or above, recruiting students in two phases each year, recruiting 80 to 100 students each time, graduating every six months, and sending them to various provinces after graduation for long-term guidance, and taking the responsibility for assessing grades. Every six months, each province must increase an average of three persons in charge of full-time adult supplementary education. After six years, each province can get more than 30 people.</p>
<h3>(3) Measures to Increase School Buildings and Equipment</h3>
<p>1.  Each literacy school needs at least two rooms. In addition to those used by elementary schools concurrently, an average of 589 schools are needed in 1,915 counties across the country. Cities can use public institutions, charitable institutions, secondary schools or above, and rural towns can temporarily use pavilions or borrow tea shops. At other times, sunny days can use the open space of temple collapse. The equipment is also borrowed from the original ones. If it is an empty room, students should bring their own chairs.</p>
<p>2.  Award private donations of houses, or donations to build school buildings, or public fundraising to build simple people's education halls or agricultural education halls.</p>
<h3>(4) Budget Estimates and Allocation</h3>
<p>1.  The total budget is actually 339,524,000 yuan, and it needs 56,587,440 yuan per year on average for six years (a detailed budget table is attached in the plan).</p>
<p>2.  In the distribution of funds, the central government bears 45% of the total amount, and should bear 25,464,348 yuan per year. The provincial and local governments bear 10% of the total amount, and should bear 5,658,744 yuan per year (except for the six provinces of Mongolia, Tibet, Suiyuan, Rehe, Chahar, Ningxia, Xikang, and Qinghai, if it is calculated by the remaining twenty-two provinces such as Jiangsu, each province will bear an average of about 250,000 yuan per year). The county and local governments bear the same amount as the central government each year.</p>
<p>The current number of counties and cities in the country is 2,000. Averaging the allocation, each county should raise an average of more than 12,500 yuan per year, but the population, financial resources, and environment of each county are different, so they cannot be the same. It can also be assumed to be 15,000 to 25,000 yuan for first-class counties, 5,000 to 15,000 yuan for second-class counties, and less than 5,000 yuan for third-class counties.</p>

<p>(3) Encourage private schools to reduce the local burden.</p>
<h3>Talk by Mei Zhengyuan, Representative of the Hanshi Education Bureau Director</h3>
<p>▲Describing the Number of Schools in Hanshi</p>
<p>Mei Zhengyuan, the representative of the Director of the Hankou Special City Education Bureau, told reporters that the Hankou Special City Education Bureau was established on July 1 last year, and it has not been long since then, so there are no educational achievements to speak of, which is very regrettable. At this conference, Director Wang Yiqun originally intended to attend in person, but because he also served as the Minister of Organization of the Municipal Party Department, and had to actively plan the future progress of municipal education, he could not come to Beijing in person. The education funds of Hanshi are currently 50,000 yuan per month (the administrative expenses of more than 9,700 yuan per month are outside the 50,000 yuan). After the summer vacation this year, it has been decided to increase to 100,000 yuan. The funds are issued monthly, and there has never been a case of arrears. There are 39 municipal primary schools and 9 senior primary schools in the city, including 3 complete primary schools, all with attached kindergartens. There are 22 registered private primary schools, and there are more than 180 private schools that have been registered. There is one municipal vocational school, with three departments: applied chemistry, dyeing and weaving, and commerce. There is one women's vocational supplementary school, with three departments: sewing, dyeing and weaving, and embroidery. There is one public education teacher training institute, which is set up to train teachers for public schools. There are 22 workers' schools, which teach workers' children during the day and workers' supplementary lessons in vocational skills in the evening. In addition, there are 7 public education centers and 3 popular libraries. After the summer vacation, it is planned to add one complete secondary school for boys and girls, both with senior high school normal departments. The Education Bureau is working hard to expand education in Hancheng. After the summer vacation, 300,000 yuan of municipal public bonds will be allocated for the construction of primary school buildings. It is planned to build 30 primary schools, each with eight grades. Among the nine complete primary schools, it is planned to convert two schools into experimental primary schools. Vocational supplementary schools will be increased by 10 schools each year, so that primary school graduates who are unable to continue their studies will be given sufficient preparation in their careers. The minimum monthly salary for primary school teachers in Hanshi is 46 yuan, and 5 yuan is added each year to 230 yuan. The minimum salary for senior primary school education is 70 yuan, and 10 yuan is added each year after three years to 140 yuan. The monthly salary of junior high school teachers is still calculated by the hour, 7 yuan per 7 hours, and 10 yuan per hour in senior high school. After three years, the monthly increase is 10 yuan, up to 180 yuan.</p>
<h3>Talk by Lu Yougang, Director of the Guangzhou Education Bureau</h3>
<p>▲Education is gradually progressing</p>
<p>Lu Yougang, Director of the Guangzhou Special Education Bureau, departed from Guangdong on the 8th and arrived in Shanghai at the same time as the three experts of the conference, Zhuang Zexuan and Zhong Rongguang. Zhuang and Zhong stayed in Shanghai for a few days, and he arrived in Beijing on the 13th. The reporter interviewed him at the hotel and made the following conversation.</p>
<p>The Guangzhou Education Bureau was established in the 9th year of the Republic of China. In January of this year, Guangzhou was ordered to be changed to a special city, and the Special City Education Bureau was established in March of the same year. He served as the Director. The city's education was affected by military and communist control two or three years ago, and it was not easy to maintain the status quo. There was no possibility of development. In the past one or two years, the municipal administration has been stable, and everything has gradually gotten on track. Education has been gradually progressing, and education funds have also increased the most in the past one or two years. The city's education funds have now increased to 120,000 yuan per month. There are a total of nine municipal secondary schools, including one each for middle school, teachers' college, vocational school, workers' school, commercial school, industrial school, art school, and nanny school. Two new secondary schools will be established after the summer vacation, and their school buildings are under construction. There are a total of 80 complete primary schools in the city, and more than 10 schools have attached kindergartens. Based on his personal experience, the number of primary schools should be small, and the number of grades in each school should be large, which is easier to handle and the results are easier to see. There are also nearly 30 subsidized private primary schools in the city. For detailed statistics, he has compiled a report to the conference, which will compile the recent educational overview statistics of the city separately for reference. The lowest-level assistant teacher's monthly salary for primary school teachers is 40 yuan, and the formal teacher's salary is 47 yuan and 1 jiao, which increases by 7 yuan and 5 jiao each year up to a maximum of 180 yuan. The monthly salary of middle school teachers is calculated by the hour, ranging from 5 yuan to 7 yuan for junior high school teaching, and from 8 yuan to 9 yuan for senior high school. The above are all calculated in haoyang.</p>
<h3>Educational Opinions by Ms. Gao Junshan</h3>
<p>Ms. Gao Junshan is an expert member of the First National Education Conference. Last year, she was sent by the Fujian Education Department to study education at the University of Michigan in the United States. She has rich knowledge and experience. Recently, she sent an educational opinion letter from the United States. The plan is well-thought-out and insightful. However, this All-China Education Conference stipulates that in addition to discussing the specific plans stipulated by the Ministry of Education, no more proposals will be accepted. Therefore, this newspaper is specially published to attract the attention of the members attending the conference. Editor's note.</p>

<p>▲Temporary Remedial Measures Before Universal Compulsory Education Can Be Realized (Three Types)</p>
<p>Implementing compulsory education and forced education is like talking on paper. It has been many years. Its biggest reason is the problem of funding. Judging from the current financial situation, although the government is determined to implement universal compulsory education, I am afraid that it will be difficult to realize it in the next few years. If we wait until the national financial resources are abundant before it can be implemented, this kind of ideal will forever become an illusion in our minds. But under the current economic capacity, isn't there a specific way to get close to, assuming that it cannot be fully achieved, this kind of ideal? Now, for the purpose of immediate relief, I will not hesitate to propose three methods for the reference of those who run compulsory education, but since they are neither "existing since ancient times" nor "common in Europe and the United States," I am afraid that they will inevitably be criticized by the general public in society.</p>
<p>(A) Compulsory Education Experimental Area Plan to Raise the Age of Enrollment and Shorten the Length of Schooling</p>
<p>(1) Reasons</p>
<p>(1) According to the preliminary plan for the implementation of compulsory education recently announced by the Ministry of Education, the length of schooling is set between the ages of 6 and 11 or 12 (school-age children) for four years. This new regulation has already been reduced by two years compared with the past, but judging from the current economic situation in our country, I am afraid that four years of compulsory education will still be difficult, so we should think of a more economical way, that is, to raise the age of enrollment from 11 to 17 years old and shorten the length of schooling for two years as a temporary relief. In this way, the national burden can be reduced by half. For four years of compulsory education, assuming that each child should cost 28 yuan, it can be reduced to 14 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) According to recent studies by psychological experts on adult learning, we know that the childhood period that was previously recognized as the golden age of learning is not absolute. It turns out that the learning ability of older people (those under 50) is not only not weaker than that of younger people, but sometimes even stronger than them. For materials that require reasoning ability, of course, older people are better than young children, and those who do not know how to learn and engage in muscular activities are also better than children under ten years old. Therefore, it can be inferred that children between the ages of 11 and 17, if given two years of education, may gain more basic knowledge and skills than four years of education between the ages of 6 and 12.</p>
<p>(3) Learning ability is not the only element of success in school. In addition, the influence of emotions is also very important. Slightly older children have a little awareness of the meaning of life. They know that if they don't</p>

<p>learn, they will suffer, so they must be more diligent than young children. Their vision is also a little broader, and they can see what kind of assistance the education they receive will provide in their lives. Therefore, their learning has motivation. Therefore, the basic knowledge and skills that should be learned in four years can definitely be completed within a year if they are allocated and taught using ideal methods, and there will be better results.</p>
<h3>(2) Measures</h3>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Education should issue a circular to various provinces, selecting one or two counties as pilot areas for compulsory education, raising the age of enrollment, and shortening the length of schooling.</p>
<p>(2) Investigate the total number of children aged eleven to seventeen in the area. Children aged eleven to seventeen who are already in regular primary and secondary schools are not within the scope of the pilot project, so their numbers should be deducted.</p>
<p>(3) Establish a number of primary schools in the pilot area according to the needs of children aged eleven to seventeen.</p>
<p>(4) Compel children aged eleven to seventeen in the pilot area who are out of school to enroll in the newly established primary schools. No one may evade this under any pretext.</p>
<p>(5) The Ministry of Education should hire experts to develop a two-year primary school curriculum and compile textbooks for each subject, ensuring that they suit the abilities and interests of children of this age group. It should also formulate ideal teaching methods and administration to serve as a guide for implementation in each pilot area. However, all regulations should be lenient, allowing each pilot area to freely experiment according to local conditions.</p>
<p>(6) The progress and difficulties of the experiment in each area should be reported at any time to provide a basis for expert research and improvement.</p>
<p>(7) If, after two years, the results are as we expect, saving half the cost and achieving equivalent or better results, this method can be universally adopted in various regions. When the national finances are sufficient, the duration of universal compulsory education can be increased to three, four, six, or eight years.</p>
<p>(B) Proposal for a Self-Study System Pilot Project</p>
<p>(1) Rationale</p>
<p>At a time when there is a shortage of teachers and school buildings, universal compulsory education is impossible. The most pitiful thing is that every year when school starts, many children who come to enroll are turned away because the quotas in each class are full. (Moreover, this happens even in some very expensive private schools.) Everyone fulfills the obligation of paying taxes, but does not equally enjoy the right to willingly pay extra. This is very unfair. Therefore, we have no choice but to seek a second-best solution and adopt a self-study system. With this system, there is no need to increase teachers, school buildings, or equipment, and out-of-school children or adults can learn some basic knowledge and skills.</p>
<h3>(2) Measures</h3>
<p>(1) Each province should designate several counties as areas for piloting a self-study system.</p>
<p>(2) Designate several primary schools in a county, located in convenient places, as centers for the self-study system. People who want to attend school but cannot, or who cannot attend full-day classes (regardless of whether they are adults or children), can come to the school to receive several self-study instructions, and then take the materials home to study on their own.</p>
<p>(3) The Ministry of Education should hire experts to determine the steps for self-study, curriculum standards, and textbook content.</p>
<p>(4) The Ministry of Education should compile self-study textbooks for adults and children for use.</p>
<p>(5) After a certain period of self-study, those who pass the exam can be issued a certain certificate.</p>
<p>(6) Each school should report the results of the self-study system pilot project for research and improvement.</p>
<p>(7) If good results are obtained, it can be promoted and implemented (To be continued in Important News)</p>

<h3>Record of the Second Day of the Jiangsu Scouts Jamboree</h3>
<p>▲ Instructors Sworn In</p>
<p>▲ Closing Ceremony Today</p>
<p>Nearly a thousand Boy Scouts from Jiangsu Province came to the provincial capital to participate in the Grand Jamboree. Due to inclement weather, the first day of the event was met with heavy rain. The competition was halted after the opening ceremony. However, the overall spirit was full, and the organizers were particularly enthusiastic. Yesterday (the 14th) morning, despite the torrential rain, they still held morning exercises and camp inspections. At 8 a.m., a memorial week for the late Premier was held, with Chen Bangxi, the camp director, reporting on party affairs and the general political situation. He continued, saying that the halt of this Grand Jamboree due to rain was unfortunate. Due to the cold weather, most of the young children were lightly clothed, and it was feared that their bodies would not be able to withstand it. It was decided to dismantle the camp at 12 noon on the 14th. If the weather cleared on the 15th, an awards ceremony would be held. On the 16th, they would go to Beijing. Yesterday, after twelve o'clock, all the tents in the public sports field were removed and they are now stationed in the provincial and county party headquarters and various primary schools in the urban area.</p>
<h3>▲ Instructors Sworn in</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Boy Scout Instructors held a swearing-in ceremony at the Provincial Party Headquarters conference room yesterday (the 14th) afternoon at 4 p.m. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Instructors: Provincial Instructor Xu Guozhi, Zhenjiang Chen Bangcai, Wujin Wang Tao, Wuxian Zhu Chongming, Kunshan Zhang Chou, Jiangdu Du Zhaotang, Gangshan Gu Zuhua, Haimen Shi Yuanren, Nantong Guo Jitong, Jiangyin Xu Jiagui, Rugao Zhang Minyi</p>
<p>▲Oath: I sincerely abide by the late Premier's will, complete the national revolution, support farmers and workers, and all oppressed people, observe discipline, and carefully plan.</p>
<p>▲Supervising Official's Address: Ye Xiufeng, the supervising official from the Provincial Party Headquarters, gave an address, roughly stating that today is the swearing-in ceremony for the Jiangsu Provincial Boy Scout Instructors. You all have a long history with the Boy Scouts, and good results. The swearing-in ceremony is generally regarded as a routine matter. However, your swearing-in today should not be treated as routine. It should be known that after this swearing-in, all of you will bear a much heavier responsibility. In the current situation of Chinese society, the general public has not fully recognized the Boy Scouts. The responsibility of making the public understand the Boy Scouts belongs to you. At the same time, the instructors who are appointed according to the Boy Scout service regulations are quite clear about the ideology and are also party members. Therefore, your responsibilities seem to be twofold. I deeply hope that you will promote Chinese society with the spirit of the Boy Scouts, and on the party's side, work hard for the party with the spirit of the Boy Scouts. Therefore, your swearing-in is more important than other swearing-in ceremonies. You have good experience and a clear understanding of the party, and you will definitely be able to bear this responsibility. Jiangsu's Boy Scouts can be called advanced in the country. Judging from the results of this Grand Jamboree, it is expected that there will be even better results in the future when participating in the National General Review. I hope that you will continue to work hard and develop Jiangsu's Boy Scouts as a model for the whole country.</p>
<p>▲Sworn Officials' Reply: The sworn officials publicly elected Provincial Instructor Mr. Xu Guozhi as the representative to reply, roughly saying, today we are deeply grateful for the guidance given to us by Comrade Ye Xiufeng, the supervising official of the Provincial Party Headquarters, at the inauguration ceremony. In addition to expressing our heartfelt thanks, we will follow the Three Principles of the People created by the late Premier, as well as our inherent rules, and we dare to say boldly that one individual and all instructors will be able to do so.</p>
<h3>▲Judges Meet</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5 p.m., the Instructors Judging Committee was held to evaluate the quality of each troop and distribute the awards. This (15th) morning at 10 a.m., a meeting of conveners was held, and at 5 p.m. by Ye Chucang, Zhang Daofan, Hu Puan, Chen Hexian, Wu Feng and others, an awards ceremony was held again at the Public Sports Ground. Yesterday afternoon, the troops did not visit or tour various places because the weather had not cleared or there was drizzling rain or torrential rain. However, Boy Scouts were seen everywhere, touring freely.</p>

<h3>Record of Twenty-Two Groups' Feast for the Representatives of National Games Athletes</h3>
<p>After the closing of the National Games, athletes from various regions are passing through Shanghai on their way home. In addition to holding a welcome reception at the Central Assembly Hall yesterday afternoon at 1 p.m. to express their joy, twenty-two groups in the city also hosted a banquet for the representatives of athletes from various regions at the Xinxin Restaurant last night at 7 p.m., doing their best to be good hosts. The whole room was filled with joy, and people still thought of the athletes' good skills in the sports arena. It was truly an unprecedented event. The situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Attending Guests and Hosts: The guests and hosts attending that evening included Chen Dezheng, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Zhu Shaoping of the World Student Association, representatives of various groups, reporters from various newspapers, and representatives of athletes from various regions, about two hundred people in total, making it a very grand occasion.</p>
<p>▲The Glory of the Athletes: Since the middle of June, honored guests have been arriving one after another. Among them, Mr. Liu Changchun and Ms. Sun Guiyun, athletes from the Northeast, were the most admired by the crowd. After Ms. Sun arrived, Mr. Zhu Shaoping and Mr. Huang Jingwan introduced her to all the guests one by one, and they all shook hands with Ms. Sun as a courtesy. After they were seated, Mr. Huang introduced Mr. Liu Changchun, and everyone applauded to show their welcome. They then introduced Zhong Lianji, Hao Chunde, Cao Yu, and the athletes from various regions, who all stood up one by one and nodded to the hosts and guests at the table. Everyone smiled and was humble. Liu Changchun and Zhong Lianji sat and chatted very happily. The two famous sprinters from the North and South, who used to compete in the sports arena, are now celebrating together at the banquet. This situation is not easy to come by.</p>
<p>▲Chairman's Welcoming Speech: Mr. Chen Dezheng, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Chairman, stood up and gave a welcoming speech, roughly stating that on behalf of the twenty-two groups in the city, he sincerely welcomes the representatives of the athletes attending the meeting. This National Games was truly an unprecedented grand event. In the past history of Chinese sports, China's backwardness and inferiority to others have become a disgrace. The Far Eastern Games will soon open, and the athletes, after working hard in the National Games, will go to the East to win glory for the country. I hope that all the athletes will wash away the weakness of the past and win the championship. This is what the people of the country have long expected of the athletes. It is also what the twenty-two groups, who are acting as hosts today, privately pray for. A cup of clear water, I wish you all good health and hard work. The audience applauded after he finished speaking.</p>
<p>▲Guests' Speeches: Then, Liu Changchun, Zhang Lingjia, Ms. Sun Guiyun, Ms. Wang Shufang (coach of the Eastern Special District), Xia Yunpu (representative of Liaoning), Li Yousheng (representative of the Eastern Special District), Zhao Dexin, Yang Ying (representative of Suiyuan), Yan Renying (representative of Tianjin), Teng Shuyi (North China Daily [Beiping News]), Lin Yin'nan (representative of Fujian), Lai Bin (representative of Jiangsu), Cao Yu, Hao Chunde, etc. stood up and gave speeches, generally encouraging them to work hard in the future. Their witty remarks were like a string of pearls, and the hall laughed with joy.</p>
<p>▲Work Hard to Repay: Ms. Wang Shufang, coach of the Eastern Special District, stood up on behalf of Ms. Sun Guiyun and gave a thank you speech, roughly stating that she was very honored to be invited to the banquet by various groups in Shanghai today. In this National Games, Ms. Sun Guiyun was fortunate enough to win the 50-meter and 100-meter championships. She was surprised and delighted, but she did not dare to be complacent in the slightest. Ms. Sun Guiyun had competed with female athletes from Germany and Japan in the East China Sino-German-Japanese Games. Although Sun won third place, her results were still one second behind the record of Ms. Jinue Hitomi from Japan. In the future, she should be given more opportunities to practice so that she can make good progress. In the future, she may be able to win an honor in the Far Eastern Games to revitalize the weak women of our country, and also to repay your sincere welcome.</p>
<p>▲Humorous Entertainment: During the banquet, the Peacock Necktie Company distributed neckties to each representative, two for each. There were still many left over, so the chairman announced the start of entertainment, using the neckties as prizes. Then, Mr. Xue from the College of Political Science and Law sang a humorous ditty, which was extremely funny. Next, Yan Renying from Tianjin and Lai Bin from Jiangsu sang Peking opera, which reverberated through the clouds. Then, Teng Shusen from the Beiping Daily dressed up in a funny face, which was extremely humorous. Sun Tongbi sang a German song, and Shen Kunnan danced the Charleston, causing thunderous laughter. Everyone dispersed in joy.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>China and Japan's Tariffs Must Be Equal and Reciprocal</h3>
<p>▲Three National Goods Groups Send Telegram to the Government</p>
<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association and other groups request that goods such as Chinese silk be included in the Sino-Japanese treaty for reciprocity. They sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which reads: (abbreviated title) On the 4th of this month, newspapers in Shanghai published a Nanjing telegram from the Asahi Shimbun of Japan stating that there are 62 items, totaling 101 types, in the Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty's provisions for reciprocal treatment of Japanese goods shipped to China, which still follow the current import tariff names and do not use the name of reciprocity. There is no mention of the shipment of national goods to Japan and Korea. It has been found that unequal treaties in the past were harmful in that there were only tariff regulations for Japanese goods shipped to China, but no tariff regulations for Chinese goods shipped to Japan. As a result, Chinese goods to Japan were subject to harsh levies, and our country could not interfere, causing a major disaster. There is no reason to repeat the same mistakes and seek self-destruction this time. All colleagues in the Chinese goods industry are extremely panicked upon reading this. Abolishing unequal treaties is the most important instruction of our late Premier. The relationship between China and Japan is the closest, and our country has suffered the most from the unequal Sino-Japanese treaties. Now, when we are revising the commercial treaty, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. All the unequal points of the past should be changed to equality. As for reciprocal tariff rates, both parties should have equal tariffs on the same type of goods, such as raw materials and raw materials, and finished products and finished products, before reciprocity can be achieved. Now, regarding the issue of reciprocal agreements in the Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty, our side firmly declares that there is no such thing, while Japan openly announces it. Judging from this, Japanese goods shipped to China can get reciprocity for as many as 101 types, but whether Chinese goods shipped to Japan can get reciprocity, and what goods and tariff rates are involved, is unclear. For example, in the past, from the Qing Dynasty to the eighth year of the Republic of China, Chinese silk shipped to Japan and Korea was subject to a 7.5% ad valorem duty. At that time, Chinese silk was sold in large quantities. Since the ninth year of the Republic of China, it has been changed to a tax of 520 yuan per 100 catties, and at that time, sales had already been reduced by half. Unexpectedly, since the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, it has been changed to 100% of the estimated value, and the estimated value has been arbitrarily increased. Since then, sales of Chinese silk have been completely cut off, and it has been six years since then. The silk industry has suffered heavy losses. As for ramie cloth, from the Qing Dynasty to the eighth year of the Republic of China, it was subject to a 7.5% ad valorem duty. Since the ninth year of the Republic of China, it was suddenly changed to a specific duty of 10 yuan to 56 yuan per 100 catties. Since the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, it was again changed to 12 yuan to 80 yuan per 100 catties. Such heavy import taxes have led to sluggish sales, which have decreased year by year. This association believes that the key to the shipment of Chinese goods to Japan and Korea is at this time, which is extremely important to the national economy and people's livelihood. Therefore, we boldly risk offending and submit this telegraph jointly. We humbly request that Your Excellencies insist on mutual tariff autonomy. If reciprocity is agreed upon, please approve the inclusion of goods that are commonly sold to Japan and Korea, such as Chinese silk, ramie cloth, porcelain, and southern goods, in the reciprocity list, so as to conform to the principle of equality and maintain the livelihood of industry and commerce. If the Japanese side does not agree, our side must not sign the agreement. The telegraph does not overcome the urgency of the matter, awaiting orders. Sincerely, the China National Goods Maintenance Association, the Shandong Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai, and the Shanghai Ramie Cloth Association. (Signature)</p>
<h3>Examination of Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement Obtained by Japanese Consulate</h3>
<p>▲ Privy Council of Japan Scheduled to Meet on the 17th</p>
<p>The draft of the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement was brought back to Japan by Yokotake, a commercial official of the Japanese Embassy, for submission to the Japanese government for review. It has been several days since then. According to news from the Japanese Embassy Office yesterday, the draft was once reviewed by the Privy Council's Review Committee the day before yesterday (the 12th). It is now scheduled to convene a second review meeting on the 17th of this month. Once it passes the third reading, it can be formally approved. At that time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will instruct Ambassador Shigemitsu to go to Beijing on a scheduled date to sign the official agreement. Commercial Official Yokotake will also be ordered to return to China, it is said.</p>
<h3>Unanimous Opposition to Japanese Warships Conducting Large-Scale Exercises in Chinese Territory</h3>
<p>▲ Declaration by the Ninth District Party Headquarters: The facts of Japanese imperialism's aggression against our country are deeply imprinted in our minds. Examples include carving up Korea, seizing Taiwan, occupying Lushun and Dalian, invading Manchuria and Mongolia, coercing treaties, and creating tragic incidents. Tracing back their intentions, they will not be satisfied until they devour China entirely. Recently, taking advantage of our central government's large-scale campaign to suppress rebels, they have spared no effort to violate international law, dispatching large numbers of Japanese warships to China to conduct reconnaissance and demonstration operations. Eventually, due to the unyielding spirit of our people, they aroused nationwide opposition. Instead of realizing the danger and withdrawing promptly, they have intensified their actions, even attempting to gather minesweeping squadrons to conduct large-scale exercises on Zhoushan Island in our territory. Upon hearing this shocking news, this committee is deeply indignant. We believe that this is a disregard for our national sovereignty and an insult to our national identity. We cannot bear to sit idly by and remain silent. In addition to submitting a request to the government authorities for serious negotiations, and leading all party members in the district to pledge our support and face any danger without hesitation, we also hope that all compatriots across the country will rise up together and engage in further struggles with these Japanese imperialists to protect our national rights and avenge our humiliation. This declaration is hereby made, please be aware.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram from the Twenty-First Sub-Branch of the First District: Previously, Japan sent warships to China, which was met with opposition from the entire nation. Unexpectedly, we recently received news that a large number of minesweeping squadron warships are gathering on Zhoushan Island in our territory for exercises. This not only infringes upon our national rights and insults our national identity, but also makes their reconnaissance tactics and conspiracies even more obvious. In addition to vowing to oppose this with our lives, this sub-branch also hopes that our comrades and compatriots across the country will unanimously urge the government to lodge a serious protest and protect our national rights. May the Party and the nation be fortunate, and may the people be fortunate.</p>
<p>▲ Declaration by the Third Sub-Branch of the Sixth District: (Beginning omitted) Reading the newspaper, we learned that Japan, relying on its powerful warships, is using our country as a venue for exercises. Upon hearing this news, we are filled with outrage. Although our country is weak, within its territorial waters, its sovereignty is complete. There is absolutely no room for foreign warships to act freely. Moreover, the breakdown of the Five-Power Treaty has become obvious to the world. The fuse of a future war will undoubtedly be ignited in the Pacific. Therefore, Japanese warships conducting exercises in China not only trample on our national sovereignty, but also foreshadow a war in East Asia, with our country being the inevitable battleground. Hence, they have resorted to this absurd act, unprecedented in history. In short, Japan, with its ambition to control the world war, regards our country as something in its pocket. We find this extremely difficult to endure. Today, we dare to announce to the entire nation that we must resist unanimously, embrace the fearless spirit of our Premier, and drive out these Japanese imperialists who violate international law and despise the public opinion of the Republic of China. This declaration is hereby made, hoping for a response.</p>
<p>▲ Declaration by the Twelfth Sub-Branch of the Ninth District: Our neighbor Japan, although sharing the same script and race with our country, possesses a heart of malice a hundred times greater than that of snakes and scorpions. The coerced signing of the Twenty-One Demands was truly intended to put us to death. The creation of the May 30th Massacre broke the record for slaughter. All of us countrymen are filled with indignation and seek to avenge this unbearable hatred. Who would have expected that Japan's ambition for aggression has never ceased? Now, they have intensified their actions, taking advantage of the internal turmoil caused by warlords in our country, and have dispatched sixteen warships of the First Minesweeping Squadron, freely sailing to places like Nanjing and Hankou, and are even gathering near Zhoushan Island to conduct large-scale exercises. Their intention is simply to devour China. If this can be tolerated, our country will be lost in no time. The comrades of this headquarters vow to fight the Japanese dwarfs to the end. We would rather be shattered jade than remain intact tiles. We still hope that all compatriots across the country will rise up together and urge the government to resist seriously in order to secure the Party and the nation. This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Japanese Navy in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ Tomorrow, They Will Proceed to the Zhoushan Archipelago for Exercises</p>
<p>The Japanese Navy's First Minesweeping Fleet, consisting of sixteen warships led by Rear Admiral Goto, sailed down the Yangtze River from Hankou on the 11th and returned to Wusong. Today, they arrived near Zhoushan Island and lined up to join the various warships of the First Overseas Fleet stationed in Shanghai, preparing to conduct spring exercises near Zhoushan Island tomorrow. The Japanese Ministry of the Navy has specially dispatched the special service ship Noto, loaded with military supplies, which sailed into Wusong yesterday, it is said.</p>
<h3>Hu Zuyu Telegraphs About Successful Suppression of Bandits</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Wusong Garrison Headquarters received a telegram yesterday from Hu Zuyu in Suzhou, stating: The Shanghai Garrison Commander Xiong Junjian, secretly, a gang of bandits from Haizhou, numbering about four to five hundred, with more than thirty boats, after being encircled and suppressed by my department on all sides, fled to Baopu today and engaged in fierce fighting for several hours, killing forty to fifty bandits and capturing more than ten. More than ten bandit boats were sunk, and countless drowned. Our army captured more than ten bandit boats, more than ten rifles, seven Mausers, and rescued more than forty hostages. Our army also suffered three soldiers killed in action and more than ten wounded. This force seems to have been completely eliminated. Also, today, the 11th Water Police Team intercepted a bandit boat near Weijing, rescuing six hostages. Respectfully reported, Hu Zuyu kowtows, original seal.</p>
<h3>Announcement for the People by the First District Office of the County</h3>
<p>▲ Joint Military-Police Defense to Protect Minhang</p>
<p>Wu Jingqing, the chief of the First District of Shanghai County, recently, due to rampant rumors in Minhang Town in the district after the looting of Zhangyan, causing residents to feel apprehensive and move to Shanghai in droves, specially issued an announcement for the people yesterday. The announcement is recorded as follows: Since the looting of Zhangyan, rumors have been rampant in Minhang. In order to stabilize the locality, this district office, in addition to having already resolved through a joint meeting of various public organizations to expand the members of the security corps, purchase more firearms, and increase strength, also established a joint military-police-corps defense office yesterday, dividing sections for patrols. On the one hand, it has notified the electric light plant and telephone bureau to work around the clock, with internal and external arrangements being extremely thorough. All residents of our district are requested to work peacefully and not to panic. If there are troublemakers who spread rumors and cause trouble, once discovered, they will be severely punished without leniency. This announcement is specially made for general information.</p>
<h3>Rice Price Limits Must Not Be Violated</h3>
<p>▲ Rice Merchants Who Violated Price Limits Issue Pledges to Close the Case</p>
<p>▲ Rice Merchants Who Instigated Rice Boats Not to Sell Are Summoned for Admonishment</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau imposed limits on rice prices, there has been a gradual downward trend. However, the bureau recently received confidential reports that some unscrupulous merchants are still secretly engaging in acts of sabotage. On Sunday, the bureau sent personnel to cooperate with Section Member Zhang of the Public Security Bureau to conduct investigations and summoned He Yongxiang and other rice merchants who violated price limits to the case. They should have been detained, but the rice merchants repeatedly pleaded for exemption from punishment, promising not to violate the limits again. Considering that they were first-time offenders, they were ordered to have the white rice they had loaded re-evaluated and priced at 19.5 yuan per picul for sale, and they issued a pledge to close the case. The rice shops that helped sell the rice were also given severe warnings and issued pledges. If there are any further violations, they will be punished according to the police regulations, with a five-day detention. Furthermore, Lu, a merchant who sells Changbang rice, was found to have instigated Changbang rice boats not to sell. He was summoned by the Public Security Bureau to the Social Affairs Bureau for a stern admonishment and ordered to clear the source and not to disobey government orders again, lest he be prosecuted.</p>
<h3>Change of Subsidy for Grain Regulation</h3>
<p>▲ Period: From June to the End of July This Year</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Government Orders the Finance and Social Affairs Bureaus to Discuss and Decide</p>
<p>The original Shanghai Public Funds and Public Property Management Committee previously received a letter from the original Fund and Property Management Office, stating that in December of the 18th year of the Republic, it was instructed by the County Government to prepare for grain regulation. It immediately convened a meeting of district chiefs to discuss and decide. The meeting decided that the period for grain regulation would be from June to the end of July of the 19th year of the Republic. The funds for grain regulation, about 9,000 yuan from accumulated interest, would be used. The method of grain regulation would be for each district to first investigate the extremely poor and the next-to-poor, create separate lists, and then calculate and distribute accordingly. This was immediately reported to the County Government for approval. Furthermore, in February of this year, a joint meeting of the accounting officer of the office and the district chiefs decided to follow the old rules of the 9th year of the Republic and distribute money instead of grain, subsidizing the price of rice for the extremely poor and the next-to-poor separately. However, in the 9th year of the Republic, 25,000 yuan was spent on grain subsidies, which was distributed to various cities and counties according to the amount of land tax. The list for the 19th year shows that the eight townships under the county should receive a total of over 9,100 yuan, and the eleven townships incorporated into the Special Municipality should receive a total of over 15,800 yuan. The grain subsidies for the districts under the county would be distributed starting on June 1st, so the office's distribution of funds would also be distributed at the same time to areas suffering from hardship. This was resolved by the 31st standing meeting of the committee, which decided to amend the names of the districts in the region according to the current system and submit them to the Municipal Government for review. After receiving the report, the Municipal Government, regarding the method of distribution and payment for the eleven cities and counties, specially instructed the Social Affairs and Finance Bureaus to discuss and decide and report back in detail for consideration.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Holds Representative Meeting Tonight</h3>
<p>▲ Exchange Opinions on Electing Chinese Directors and Committee Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Taxpayers' Association, after electing the eighty-one representatives of this term, has been preparing for the opening procedures of the various representative conferences. The preparations are now complete, and it has been decided to convene the first representative conference of this term at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 PM on the 16th of this month to discuss various important motions, elect five Chinese directors and six Chinese committee members to the Municipal Council, and elect twenty-seven executive committee members of the association. The notice of this convocation has been issued, and a representative dinner party will be held at 7:00 PM tonight, during which opinions on the election of Municipal Council directors and committee members will be exchanged.</p>
<h3>Chinese Staff Member of Customs Promoted to Customs Commissioner</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance's Customs Administration appointed Meierhe as the Inspector General of Customs, Meierhe, in view of China's determination to recover customs administration, has made every effort to promote its improvement, and to improve the treatment of Chinese staff members, so that Chinese and foreign staff members are in an equal position, as an initial step towards Chinese autonomy, especially in the measures taken. This time, he has specially promoted three Chinese staff members to the position of Customs Commissioner, namely He Zhihui, the Customs Commissioner of Hangzhou Customs, Weng Junshouzhen of Yangzhou Customs, and Ding Juitang of the Inspector General of Customs Office. Mr. Ding is an early graduate of the Beijing Customs School, with excellent academic knowledge and capable handling of affairs. He is known to the Customs Commissioner and the Inspector General of Customs. Two years ago, he was promoted to Chief Secretary of Chinese Affairs, acting as Customs Commissioner. Now, he has been officially awarded the responsibility of Customs Commissioner. Counting Mr. He, Mr. Weng, and Mr. Ding, after their promotion to Customs Commissioner, there are still Zhou Junziheng, the Customs Commissioner of Chongqing Customs, holding this position, making a total of four people. Those who are currently acting as Customs Commissioners include Zhang Junbolie of Wenzhou Customs and Qiao Junruyong of Yuezhou Customs. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Qiao are also graduates of the Beijing Customs School. Furthermore, since the five external regular customs offices of Yangzhou, Fengyang, and other customs offices, as well as Wenzhou, Wuhu, and other ports, have been managed by the Customs on behalf of them, the tax revenue has more than doubled compared to before. Song Ziwen, the Minister of Finance, has repeatedly praised the customs officers' ability to handle affairs and their integrity, it is said.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Two Railways Is Not a Reduction of Staff</h3>
<p>The staff and employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Ningbo Railways have recently undergone a reorganization due to the unified organization of the Ministry of Railways. As a result, the compilation and transportation sections of the two railways have been abolished first. The division chiefs and clerks of various departments are all in a state of panic. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, they elected representatives to petition Director Liu of the two railways to protect the employees. Director Liu explained to the representatives that this reorganization is not a reduction of staff, and that those who have already been laid off are being taken care of, and he guaranteed that there would be no reduction of staff. Employee benefits are also guaranteed. The representatives were very satisfied with Director Liu's frankness and have informed their colleagues of this intention. It is thought that the staff and employees of the two railways will be able to serve with peace of mind upon hearing this news. This is also good news for the transportation sector.</p>
<h3>Merger of China Merchants Bureau Shanghai Branch Implemented Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Deputy Section Chief Li Yunliang Has Returned to Shanghai</p>
<p>The news that the Shanghai branch of the China Merchants Bureau has been merged into the business section of the head office, with Bureau Chief Shen Zhongyi renamed as Section Chief, and former Deputy Section Chief of the Business Section Li Yunliang continuing to hold his original position, etc., has already been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the merger of the bureau was implemented yesterday (Monday). A part of the business section of the head office also moved to the inner entrance downstairs (formerly the front desk) to work yesterday. The organization of the section will follow the new system, dividing into five units: navigation, cargo solicitation, branch offices, auditing, and disaster relief. If there are any unsuitable aspects, they can be changed at any time. The head of the section, Zhao, has stipulated that the number of staff in the section is fifty people. Because the Shanghai branch, together with the business section of the head office, has more than one hundred people, which is twice the current stipulated number, there is no way to accommodate them. Therefore, Section Chief Shen is currently discussing accommodation methods with Zhao. It is said that the extra personnel will be selected for their competence and assigned to branch offices to work, or to serve as inspectors, or they will be laid off. No decision has been made yet, so the staff of the section has not been announced.</p>
<p>Li Yunliang, the deputy section chief who was previously dispatched to inspect the Yangtze River area, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. When Mr. Li arrived in Hankou, the bureau's Yangtze River ships were requisitioned. After strenuous negotiations, they were released.

Now that the matter has been completed, he took the Jianghua ship to Beijing, changed to a train, and returned to Shanghai, arriving yesterday morning. It is said that Mr. Li's contact with Hakka businessmen in Xunhan and other ports was very harmonious, and he has many plans for the branch offices. The bureau's Yangtze River route business will have new developments in the future.</p>

<h3>Yunnan Fellow Countrymen Host Farewell Banquet for Zhang Weihan</h3>
<p>▲ Zhang Has Postponed His Departure to Around the 20th</p>
<p>▲ If There Is No Definite News of the French Envoy Coming South, He Will Leave Shanghai</p>
<p>Yunnanese from all walks of life in Shanghai held a public farewell banquet for Zhang Weihan, the representative of the province for treaty revision and the newly appointed Director of Civil Affairs of Yunnan, at the Fawang Palace Garden Hotel yesterday. Although it was only a simple tea party, more than one hundred fellow countrymen from Yunnan attended, making it quite a grand occasion. The following is a record:</p>
<p>▲ Arrangement of the Venue: The venue was the hotel's main hall. Outside the venue, a banner was hung, reading "Yunnanese Fellow Countrymen in Shanghai Respectfully Send Off Mr. Zhang Chunou." Inside the venue, more than thirty seats were arranged, with four people seated around each seat. Mr. Zhang and the temporary chairman Zhang Yaozeng were seated opposite each other, creating a solemn atmosphere.</p>
<p>▲ Chairman's Speech: Briefly stated, "Mr. Zhang Chunou is an outstanding talent from our Yunnan. For more than ten years, he has served his hometown and achieved remarkable results, which are admired by the people of Yunnan. In the winter of the year before last, he represented Yunnan Province in Beijing to participate in the revision of the Sino-French Vietnam Trade Agreement, upholding his commitment to alleviate the suffering of the Yunnanese people and increase their happiness. Now, he has been urged to return by telegram from Yunnan, upholding his spirit of serving the local area and striving to build and benefit the Yunnanese people through this participation in treaty revision. We greatly admire Mr. Chunou's past achievements and have high hopes for his future plans. Therefore, we have specially held this meeting to express our farewell."</p>
<p>▲ Mr. Zhang's Reply: Briefly stated, "I came to Beijing to represent Yunnan Province the year before last to participate in the revision of the Sino-French Trade Agreement. Everything can be found in previous newspaper reports. The draft agreement has been drafted, but the French side is still delaying on various pretexts and has not come to Beijing to sign the agreement for a long time, causing me to stay in Shanghai for a long time, unable to return. Recently, due to repeated telegrams urging me to return from the provincial government, I will come to Shanghai again when the signing of the trade agreement is scheduled. However, this morning I received a phone call from Foreign Minister Wang, saying that there is news of the French envoy coming south to sign the agreement again, asking me to wait temporarily. However, the French envoy has repeatedly delayed, and I am not sure if he will definitely come. However, due to Foreign Minister Wang's request, I will postpone my departure to the 20th. I am ashamed and unworthy of such a grand farewell from everyone. I am even more ashamed when I hear what the chairman said just now."</p>
<p>▲ Mr. Zhang's Departure Date: Due to Foreign Minister Wang's request to stay, Mr. Zhang has returned the original Asian Royal Ship and will wait for news from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. If the French envoy still has no definite news of coming south around the 20th, he will leave Shanghai on the President Coolidge or President Madison to return to Yunnan.</p>

The details of the alteration of the banknotes are photographed below to facilitate attention from all sectors.</p>

<h3>The Extraordinary Tragedy of Lingbao, Henan Province</h3>

Starving people are everywhere. They have been relying on the dried flowers of cotton trees, the cakes pressed from cotton seeds, or the bark, leaves, wheat tips, grain stalks, etc., to fill their stomachs, but now they have nothing left. Unfortunately, an epidemic is spreading, and the common people, with their pallid faces, are being infected at a rate of eight or nine out of ten. Even close relatives such as fathers and sons, brothers, and spouses can only watch them die and weep to the sky. It is said that the relief funds raised by the association for Henan have been successively delivered to the Kaifeng Chinese and Foreign Relief Association for distribution. All counties in Henan are suffering from disasters, and the disasters are all tragic. It can be said that it is a drop in the bucket. It is hoped that all sectors will find ways to help, so that not only Lingbao County will be grateful, it is said.</p>
<h3>National Goods Factory Association Seeks Exhibits for Qingdao Exhibition Hall</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Association sent a letter yesterday to various factories, which roughly stated: Recently, we received a letter from the Shanghai Business Consolidation Association's Commodity Exhibition Center, stating that the Qingdao Special Municipality Social Affairs Bureau has repeatedly sent letters to the center, indicating that the city's National Goods Exhibition Hall urgently needs to open. It plans to collect national goods products for display, in order to achieve a widespread effect. The Bureau also approved the association to jointly work with national goods organizations such as the National Goods Factory Association, the Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association, the Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, and the Mechanized National Goods Factory Association to promptly carry out matters related to soliciting exhibits in Shanghai. In response to this, we are forwarding the letter to you. We hope that your association will inform the national goods manufacturers and urge them to select new and innovative products and send them to our office before April 20 for collection, so that they can be assembled and displayed in the city. This matter concerns the promotion of national goods. Please investigate and handle it accordingly. If manufacturers still need product application forms or other documents, please obtain them directly from our office. We eagerly anticipate your cooperation. We hereby inform you, and request that you investigate and handle this matter accordingly. If you wish to participate in the exhibition, please send your products directly to the association at Tianhou Palace for easy assembly. The deadline is approaching, so please do not delay, etc.</p>
<h3>Business Consolidation Association Cables Request to Prohibit Extortion of License Fees</h3>
<p>The Business Consolidation Association yesterday sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Finance Commissioner requesting strict prohibition of tax offices from extorting license fees. The telegram stated: On the 11th of this month, the Shanghai Chinese Grain and Bean Cake Trade Association stated in a letter that businesses such as Qian Chang &amp; Co. purchase local goods such as grains and rapeseed in various cities and towns in western Zhejiang. They load these goods onto registered civilian boats and first pay taxes at local tax bureaus. They then sail to Jiaxing to declare customs, pay the regular and additional taxes, and carry the relevant documents to Shanghai for sale. All tax offices along the way are not allowed to re-levy taxes and must release the boats upon verification of the customs documents, without inventing new charges or extorting fees. These regulations have been firmly established. However, the various branches under the jurisdiction of the Jiangsu Five-Percent Tax Office arbitrarily extort license fees whenever merchants' registered civilian boats carrying goods pass through, charging six yuan per boat at Tagang, four yuan at Desheng, four yuan at Minhang, and even for boats traveling from Shanghai to Jiaxing. If the fees are not paid, the officials detain the boats. The boatmen claim that the Jiangsu Finance Department issued strict orders prohibiting extortion in March 1919, October 1927, and July 1929. They ask why the license fees are being charged again. The officials claim that the fees are being collected under the instruction of the office director to supplement insufficient funds. It is difficult to determine whether this is due to the director's instructions or the officials' excuses. The businesses operate grain cargo ships and cannot avoid these tax offices, resulting in significant losses due to years of extortion. In response to this, we request that your association send a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, ordering subordinates to thoroughly investigate the matter, abolish the extortion of license fees, and severely punish those who violate the law, in the interest of public service, etc. The Association notes that the practice of levying license fees at tax checkpoints has long been entrenched, and past orders prohibiting it have been mere formalities. Few have been punished, leading to increasing audacity among these individuals. The letter reports that officials are seeking personal gain, using the excuse of compensating for comparisons. They are trying to make the government a scapegoat. The businesses claim that the losses are enormous and they cannot tolerate it, requesting a thorough investigation. The Association believes that while the license fees are an unofficial practice with no receipts to prove it, there are witnesses who can be questioned. Furthermore, the extortion of fees from cargo ships is a common practice. If investigators are sent to conduct secret investigations on the ground, it would not be difficult to uncover the truth and deter others through punishment. The Association, seeing that past investigations have been mere formalities, has taken the liberty to offer its views. We hope that your office will consider the difficulties faced by businesses and secretly send dedicated and capable personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and punish those who violate the law, in order to eliminate the long-standing problem and alleviate business difficulties in the interest of public service. Respectfully, Shanghai Special Municipality Business Consolidation Committee.</p>
<h3>Merger of Various Silk Trade Associations Should Proceed</h3>
<p>The Civil Training Committee of the Municipal Party Headquarters sent a letter to the Business Consolidation Association, stating: We have received your letter stating that the Silk Trade Associations should be merged and reorganized immediately, and pointing out various misunderstandings, hoping that you will preside over the matter, etc. Having received this, we find that the points you have made are indeed reasonable. The various associations' quibbling and defenses are causing unnecessary complications. We request that you follow the clear orders from the Central Government, earnestly handle this matter, and cooperate within a specified time frame, so that the system can be unified and the organization can be strengthened, in the interest of public service.</p>
<h3>Continued Report on the Rope Workers' Wage Increase Movement</h3>
<p>Regarding the rope workers' wage increase, the workers discussed the matter yesterday. Representatives of the Party's Economic Action Group reported on the findings of their investigation into the wages of workers in various shops. They found that the wages in their industry are extremely low and the working hours are longer than in other industries. Furthermore, more than ten workers have been suspended from work for demanding a wage increase, which is due to the lack of unity in the industry. With the rising cost of living, it will be difficult to manage without a wage increase. After deliberation, it was decided that because the wages in various shops are too disparate, they will request a 30% increase based on the highest current wage to standardize wages. All working hours will be eight hours per day. They will request this increase from the shop owners and print a notice to be distributed to the shops by representatives, who will also explain the workers' difficulties and the need for a wage increase to the shop owners, requesting their prompt approval so that the workers can work with peace of mind. They will hold another meeting after receiving a response.</p>
<h3>Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Held Talks with Representatives of Various Trade Unions Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Reporting the Truth about the Hoji Strike</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality Federation of Trade Unions held a meeting with representatives of various trade unions in the city at 2:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from over 130 trade unions, including the Newspaper Delivery Workers' Union, totaling over 250 people, attended. Lu Jingshi presided over the meeting and reported on the purpose of the meeting. He also outlined the causes, course, and resolution of the Hoji strike, as well as the Communist Party's exploitation of the situation. Gu Yongquan of the Preparatory Committee further elaborated that the Hoji factory initially faced difficulties due to the large number of workers and limited egg supply, making it difficult to allocate work and maintain expenses. Later, the workers demanded that no workers be dismissed. After the Social Affairs Bureau mediated a resolution, the second and third branches signed agreements. However, a dispute arose over the first clause, which was resolved after mediation by the authorities. However, the Communist Party used this as a pretext for propaganda, causing young students to become emotionally charged and rally in support. After explanation, this did not lead to a major disturbance. However, the Communist Party members then used this as a pretext to exploit the situation in the Shanghai concession. The Federation of Trade Unions has invited you to discuss this matter, hoping that you will not listen to them, be used by them, or go astray and become unacceptable to the Party and the nation.</p>

<h3>Housing Dispute in Zhen'an Lane Heard Yesterday</h3>
<p>The landlord of Zhen'an Lane on Ximen Road in the French Concession gave notice to all tenants to vacate the premises by April 10. The tenants formed a joint housing association and unanimously opposed the eviction. On April 8, the landlord cut off the water supply. However, the tenants still refused to move. On April 10, the landlord commissioned lawyer Fei Xizhen to notify each tenant to vacate the premises within three days, or construction would begin. The tenants also commissioned lawyer Da Xian to respond, refusing to move. Therefore, the landlord requested the police station to send two Chinese constables to the premises with workers yesterday morning at around 11:00 AM to start construction. However, all the tenants refused. The tenants declared to the workers that the negotiations had not been resolved and requested that they temporarily stop construction, which the workers refused, resulting in a conflict between the two sides and preventing the construction from proceeding. After the landlord reported to the police station, the Songshan Road Police Station dispatched several Chinese and foreign detectives to conduct an on-site investigation. After the tenants' representatives detailed the situation, the detectives reported the situation to the head of the police station, who invited the lawyers and parties involved to the police station yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3>News from Various Trade Unions</h3>
<p>▲ British American Tobacco Factory Union Quick Telegraph: To the esteemed members of the Qingdao Special Municipality Party Headquarters: Having read the news on the 11th, we were shocked to learn that nine workers from the Qingdao British American Tobacco Company were arrested for refusing to return to work. The workers sent representatives to your department to petition, putting forward five conditions for resuming work. Your department dispatched representatives to accompany the workers' representatives back to the factory to persuade them to resume work. The workers refused mediation, resulting in a conflict with the police, leading to the arrest of over forty male and female workers and the immediate dissolution of the Tobacco Manufacturing and Printing Unions. The Qingdao British American Tobacco Factory workers had previously raised demands for wage increases due to the rising cost of living (male workers demanded an increase of 20 cents, and female workers demanded an increase of 10 cents). With the mediation of your department and government agencies, a victory was achieved, and the labor dispute was expected to be resolved. However, after Cao Yunxiang was dispatched from the Shanghai headquarters to Qingdao, a sudden announcement was made to shut down the factory, causing thousands of British American Tobacco Factory workers in Qingdao to suddenly become unemployed under dual oppression. Our association knows that this is a tactic used by the factory to exert pressure and is not a genuine long-term shutdown. We believe that during the industrial revolution, labor-capital struggles are unavoidable. However, now workers are being arrested for refusing to return to work unconditionally, and unions are being banned for failing to resume work. We know that the arrogance of imperialist capitalists will inevitably increase, and the British American Tobacco Factory workers in Qingdao will have no way out. Our association and the Qingdao British American Tobacco Union are closely related, sharing weal and woe. We deeply feel the pain of their predicament and dare not shy away from speaking out. We urge you to release the innocent arrested workers as soon as possible, restore the unjustly banned unions, and lead the workers of the Qingdao British American Tobacco Factory to advance on the road of the Three People's Principles. This is fortunate for the labor movement and fortunate for our association. Respectfully, Shanghai British American Tobacco Factory Union.</p>

<h3>A Young Man Was Assassinated in Jinjiazhai Lane Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>▲ Accompanied by a woman in a secluded alley</p>
<p>▲ Assailant opens fire from behind</p>
<p>▲ Deceased was slightly plump, resembling a businessman</p>
<p>▲ Autopsy to be conducted by the court this morning</p>
<p>Yesterday around 11:30 AM, an assassination of a young man around 26 or 27 years old occurred outside the iron gate of Jinjiazhai Lane, opposite Shou Kang Soy Sauce Garden on the east side of Dashalu, Shanhai Pass Road. The deceased was shot twice and lay dead in Jinfuli, his head a bloody mess, a gruesome sight. The following is a record of the reporter's investigation, divided into sections:</p>
<p>▲ Jinfuli Lane: A tortuous path Jinjiazhai, located on the east side of Dashalu, Shanhai Pass Road, is a tortuous path with streets crisscrossing. Although the residents are lined up side by side, the area is extremely secluded. It connects Chenjia浜 to the east, extends to Avenue Edward VII to the south, reaches Shanhai Pass Road to the north, and connects to Dashalu to the west. Although the alley is accessible from all directions, there are very few pedestrians. Therefore, thugs who enter this area consider it a rabbit's burrow, making it easy to escape.</p>
<p>▲ Two Gunshots Heard at Noon Yesterday around 11:30 AM, the residents in the area, mostly middle-class people, were either having lunch or cooking when they suddenly heard two gunshots in the alley. At first, they thought it was neighbors setting off firecrackers and didn't pay attention. Later, they heard a commotion and realized something had happened. The residents of the alley all rushed to see what was happening. Later, they saw a constable rushing over, saying that someone had been shot and killed by a thug.</p>
<p>▲ A Young Man Lying in a Pool of Blood A Chinese constable on patrol in the area arrived after hearing the news and saw a young man around 26 or 27 years old lying in a pool of blood. Upon closer inspection of his clothing, he looked like a businessman, wearing a blue serge jacket, black silk pants, Chinese leather shoes, and white cotton socks. He was round-faced and plump. The injuries were to the head, with one gunshot wound to the temple, and one gunshot wound to the back. Both bullets did not exit.</p>
<p>▲ Testimony from Eyewitnesses After the incident, eyewitnesses said that the deceased was walking in the alley with a young woman when a man in short clothes suddenly came up from behind, looking angry. When he approached the young man, he pulled out a gun and shot the deceased in the head and then in the back, resulting in the fatal attack. The thug then escaped through nearby Xingmaoli.</p>
<p>▲ Results of Investigation by Chinese and Foreign Detectives The area is under the jurisdiction of the Xinzha Police Station. Chinese and foreign detectives drove to the scene to investigate and searched the alleys thoroughly, but found nothing. They sent the deceased to the Ferren Road autopsy center and scheduled an autopsy for today. The deceased died instantly, and his name is unknown.</p>
<h3>Westerners Penetrate Remote Regions</h3>
<p>▲ Recounting the Experience Upon Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that in September of last year, Milligan, an Englishman from the Old MacKenzie &amp; Co., and Gordon, an Englishman from the Asiatic Petroleum Company, returned to their home countries from Shanghai. They suddenly had the urge to explore and took a route through the southwest frontier to Burma, where they boarded a ship. They luckily avoided diseases and bandits along the way and arrived in Burma safely after three months and two weeks. They took a boat back to Europe. Rohl, a German merchant from Chongqing, also joined them along the way. Milligan recently returned to Shanghai last week, and Rohl will also return to China around May or June. However, Gordon may not return. According to Milligan, they departed from Shanghai on September 8 last year and took a boat to Chongqing. He learned that Rohl had already left and hurried to catch up. When they arrived in Yazhou, they rented donkeys and horses and traveled along the main road to Ningyuan. However, they had to dismount and walk due to the mountain dangers. The places they passed through were relatively peaceful, with only a scarcity of products. Below Ningyuan, they originally planned to travel southwest to Lijiang, but due to a local army rebellion against its commander, the road was blocked. They had no choice but to continue along the main road south to Huili. There were no bandit incidents along the way. It is also possible to reach Lijiang from the west of Huili, but due to bandits in Yongbei, they continued along the main road used by merchants to the south to Longkai on the Jinsha River. From there, they crossed the river and entered Yunnan Province. At that time, countless merchants were waiting to cross the river at Longkai. They joined the group, but the guards initially suspected them of being defeated soldiers returning from Sichuan and refused them entry. After they explained, they were allowed to cross the river, which delayed them for two days. After entering Yunnan Province, they took a shortcut west from Makai (transliteration) to Chuxiong, where they rejoined the main road and continued west through Dali, Yongchang, and Tengyue to Bhamo in Burma. From Yazhou to Bhamo, the mountains were steep and difficult to travel. Below Bhamo, the terrain gradually flattened. They took a boat along the Irrawaddy River to Katha, then took a train through Mandalay and arrived in Rangoon on December 22. The journey from Shanghai to Rangoon was over 3,500 miles. Although they experienced hardships along the way, they found it interesting and were treated well by the people and officials everywhere they went. Food was mostly purchased locally, and it was cheap and delicious. They hired a Chinese cook in Chongqing to accompany them and act as a translator along the way. The largest wild animal they encountered in Yunnan Province was the wolf. Because they were eager to travel, they did not have time to go hunting in the deep mountains. Although they did not encounter bandits along the way, they often saw traces of banditry. Villages and towns in remote areas were mostly in ruins.</p>
<h3>The Tugboat Chartered by Shenhu Was Robbed and Kidnapped</h3>
<p>▲ Six People Kidnapped ▲ The Bandit Leader Addicted to Opium</p>
<p>The Shenhu class of small steamships of the Merchants' Inland Navigation Steamship Bureau has a total of three ships: Hengji, Hengde, and Hengsheng. Each small steamship tows three ships belonging to the company: one exclusively for transporting passengers and goods from Linghu, and two for Nanxun and Huzhou. Each time they arrive at a destination, they detach the company ships, and the small steamship continues forward. However, Linghu is located inland and cannot be reached directly. It can only be towed to Pingwang, where another small steamship, Dehe (also owned by the Merchants' Bureau), tows it into Linghu. The other day (the 13th), a chartered ship (i.e., a company ship) owned by Yang Wenrong of Wuxi, carrying more than 20 passengers and goods, was towed by Dehe from Linghu. At 3:00 PM, when it arrived at the place of Sitintze, north of Niaozhen North Gate (commonly known as Youtian Wuri Tou), which is the border area of Wujiang, Tongxiang, and Wuxing counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces (commonly known as the "three-no-management area"), a place where salt smugglers and bandits often appear, a large bandit ship and thirteen small boats suddenly appeared. The bandit gang consisted of one hundred and twenty to thirty people, all fully loaded with Lake bandits, who ordered the small steamship to stop. The bandits jumped onto the small steamship and the company ship, each holding quick-firing guns and bayonets, and began searching separately. All of the more than 20 passengers were not spared. Silver dollars, clothes, bedding, goods, and the valuables in the accounting room were all robbed onto the bandit ship. Before leaving, six people (four men and two women) were taken hostage, including Yang Liuquan, the son of the owner of the chartered ship (i.e., the company ship), and his two daughters-in-law. The rest were all passengers. The bandits searched the ship for an hour, taking all the valuables. The ship that the bandit leader was on seemed to be the bandit leader's ship. There were three female bandits, dressed in luxurious clothes. The bandit leader was addicted to opium, and a couch was laid out in the cabin, where he was inhaling the fumes. Some bandits were also cooking opium in the aft cabin. With a command from the bandit leader, the bandits returned to their small boats, each small boat seemingly led by a small leader. All the stolen valuables and cash were moved onto the bandit leader's large ship, and then they each weighed anchor and sailed away quickly. The shipowner has now reported the incident to the Merchants' Bureau, which has reported it to the Wujiang, Tongxiang, and Wuxing County Public Security Bureaus, both land and water, to send police to jointly investigate the stolen goods and bandits and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Seized Fake Official Seal in Bandit Lair</h3>
<p>The Seal Represents the Party for National Salvation</p>
<p>Jiangsu Tonghai Garrison Commander</p>
<p>▲Anti-revolutionary Connections in the Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>▲All Transferred to the Higher Court for Interrogation</p>
<p>Xiao Da, the son of Wang Bin-yan, a prominent businessman, was kidnapped on his way home from school in Zhabei a few days ago, as reported in the newspapers. The military and police authorities of both the Chinese and foreign concessions have been paying close attention to this case. The Hongkou police received a tip-off the other day that some kidnappers would be passing along Broadway Road at 2:00 PM. Detective Wei Jinfu, along with Detective He Ruhai, Officer He Xiaozhi, and Western Detective Si Wen, were dispatched to Broadway Road to lie in wait. At 2:00 PM, they apprehended Lin Jin-han, a native of Tongzhou, and took him back to the police station. According to his confession, his accomplices were hiding at No. 1132 Tongchun Lane, Gongping Road. The detectives proceeded to that location and apprehended Zhang Bing-sheng (also known as Zhang Mei-tong), his mistress Zhang Wang-shi. They also found a fake official seal inside the house, which read "Jiangsu Tonghai Garrison Commander of the Party for National Salvation," as well as a fake letter of appointment commissioning Zhang Bing-sheng as the garrison commander, and other reactionary documents. In addition, they found two fake car permit license plates. According to Zhang's confession at the police station, firearms were hidden inside the house at No. 97 Chongqing Road. Detective Zhu then went to that location to search and confiscated two thousand yuan in banknotes from the Northeast Provinces, but did not find any firearms. Zhao Jia-ying, who lived in the house, was also taken to the police station and detained for strict interrogation. Given the presence of anti-revolutionary evidence mixed in with the case, the defendants and all the evidence were transferred to the Higher Court yesterday morning, where Judge Du Fu-yao specially opened the second courtroom to hear the case. Mr. Ru Bao-yi, the police lawyer, briefly described the case, presented the various pieces of evidence and banknotes, and then Chinese and Western detectives reported on the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants. Judge Du first interrogated the defendant Lin Jin-han, who claimed that he had been farming in his hometown and had only recently come to Shanghai. He denied any knowledge of the kidnapping. Zhang Bing-sheng also claimed that he had been farming in his hometown and that after coming to Shanghai, he lived on Gongping Road. He said that the fake car permits were brought to him by a friend in a package and stored with him. He claimed that he initially did not know what was inside the package. However, a man named Lian Ying had discussed with him the possibility of committing a kidnapping, but he had refused because he considered it illegal. As for the various documents, he said that a Mr. Liu, currently in Tokyo, Japan, had introduced him to the leader, who issued the documents to him and others. Zhang Wang-shi claimed that she had been living with Zhang Bing-sheng since November of last year, for only a short time, and that she did not know what he was doing. Zhao Jia-ying claimed that he had indeed been issued a handgun when he was working as a copier in the detective squad, but he no longer had it, and there were no firearms or ammunition in his home. The banknotes from the Northeast Provinces were brought by a friend as collateral for a loan of twenty yuan. Judge Du, after hearing the testimonies, ordered that the case be re-investigated. The defendants were then returned to the police station for detention. It is still uncertain whether the kidnapping case is related to the abduction of Mr. Wang's son.</p>
<h3>City Public Security Bureau Receives Fake Letter of Appointment</h3>
<p>▲Smudged Rubbings on the Letter</p>
<p>▲Possible Frame-up Involved</p>
<p>The City Public Security Bureau recently received a letter from someone named Yang Yu-long, alleging that his brother, Yu-liang, who lives in Yihe Village, Pudong, had been appointed as a commander by the counter-revolutionary "fake commander" Xu Chong-zhi and was carrying out sabotage. The letter included a letter of appointment, in which the three characters for Yang Yu-liang appeared to have been added on top of another character after it had been erased with rubber. The year, originally 1929, had been forcibly changed from "eight" to "nine," and the month, December, was also smudged with rubber, clearly indicating that the fake letter of appointment had been intentionally altered. The Bureau, suspecting other motives, ordered the police in the third district of Pudong to summon Yang Yu-liang to the district for questioning. He claimed to be fifty-two years old, a native of Shandong, making a living by running a small teahouse in Yihe Village. He said that he had a wife and seven or eight children. He owned a small boat, which he used to row to various warships to beg for steamed buns and miscellaneous items. He said that his family was very poor, that he did not have a brother, and that there was no such person as Yang Yu-long. He claimed that it was a malicious accusation by his enemies. After verifying the testimony, the district chief sent the case to the General Bureau for disposal.</p>
<h3>Hua Cui-ying Petitions for Recognition as Daughter</h3>
<p>▲Father Runs Soap Factory, Daughter Works to Support Mother</p>
<p>▲Driven Away for Nine Years, Treated as a Stranger</p>
<p>▲Failed to Reach Agreement in Court with 500 Yuan Offer</p>
<p>▲Lawyers Go Outside to Mediate</p>
<p>Hua Guan-chen, a Ningbo native and owner of the Henry Soap Factory at Wangjiazuijiao in the South City, is being sued by Hua Cui-ying, the daughter of his concubine Hua Li-shi, who retained attorney Gu Ji-rong to file a petition in the District Court for recognition as his daughter. The petition states that the plaintiff is the biological daughter of the defendant, Hua Guan-chen. The plaintiff's mother, Hua Li-shi, married the defendant as a concubine in the 31st year of the Guangxu reign (Qing dynasty) and gave birth to a daughter (the plaintiff). However, since 1921, the defendant and the plaintiff’s mother, Hua Li-shi, had repeatedly been involved in litigation. After reaching a settlement, the defendant insisted on driving away the plaintiff’s biological mother, Hua Li-shi, and disowned the plaintiff as his daughter. At that time, the plaintiff was thirteen years old, alone and unable to support herself, and had to live with her mother, barely surviving. Nine years have passed. Now, the mother and daughter rely on their labor to make a living, struggling to eat and dress properly. The father treats his concubine as a stranger, and the father and daughter are like enemies. The future is bleak, and it is likely that they will end up in a ditch. The defendant owns a large fortune and is extremely extravagant, yet he abandons his own daughter. His intentions are clear. Therefore, the plaintiff requests a judgment ordering him to recognize her. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Zhao Zhen-hai specially opened the second courtroom to hear the case. The defendant did not appear, but retained attorney Yao Yong-li to represent him in court. Hua Cui-ying, the plaintiff, testified that she was twenty-two years old, a native of Ningbo, living at No. 37 Tongxing Street, Yangjiazhai, Pudong. She is currently working as a tin foil packer at the British American Tobacco Company. Hua Li-shi testified that she was forty-one years old, living with her daughter, relying entirely on her daughter's hard work to make a living. She is responsible for cooking and washing clothes at home. The judge asked the plaintiff, "What is your request?" Hua Cui-ying replied, "I request the defendant to recognize me as his daughter and to inherit his property." The judge said, "Is it better to reach a settlement in this case?" (Answer) "I do not want to settle."</p>
<p>"In January of this year, I returned to the defendant's home and was pushed out by my father and others." (Question) "Are you born to Li-shi?" (Answer) "Yes." (Question) "Before your mother left the defendant, did you live together or separately?" (Answer) "Together, because the first wife, named A-xiang, was extremely fierce and often mistreated my mother." (Question) "How many children did your mother give birth to?" (Answer) "Only me. The first wife gave birth to two sons and three daughters." (Question) "How much property do you want?" (Answer) "Please allocate according to the court." The judge said, "Property is another issue. Your current petition is for recognition as a daughter. Only after that is determined will we talk about property issues. But how much property does your father have?" (Answer) "The Henry Soap Factory at Wangjiazuijiao and properties in Zhenhai, my hometown, are worth about 100,000 yuan." In the past, my father gave me away to be a daughter-in-law, but I refused, so I live with my mother. Now I can earn six or seven dimes a day." At this point, she took out a copper tag from the British American Tobacco Company and presented it to the court. The judge read it and returned it to her. (Question) "Have you been betrothed?" (Answer) "No." The judge said, "Then how about your father be responsible for the expenses of your betrothal and all the dowry for your wedding in the future?" (Answer) "My father is only willing to give four or five hundred yuan, which is not enough, because when my father's eldest daughter got married, the dowry cost about five thousand yuan." At this point, the judge ordered the defendant's lawyer to state the defendant's age, place of origin, address, and occupation. Lawyer Yao stated that the defendant, Hua Guan-chen, was fifty-seven years old, a native of Zhenhai, Ningbo, residing at No. 15 Xiao Jiuhua, outside the Dadongmen, and running the Henry Soap Factory at Wangjiazuijiao. The judge asked if the plaintiff was the defendant's daughter. Lawyer Yao replied, "Yes, born to Li-shi." The judge tried to mediate a settlement in court. The defendant was only willing to pay 500 yuan, which the plaintiff did not agree to. The judge then ordered the lawyers of both parties to mediate outside the court for one week. If no settlement could be reached, another hearing would be held. The court was then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Robbers Cruelly Burn Victim's Lower Body</h3>
<p>Xu Jia-tao, a resident of Xujiazhai in Wusong West, is about forty years old and has a modest income, making him a target for robbers. At around 11:00 PM the other night, more than ten robbers, armed with sharp blades, broke down the door and rushed into the bedroom. Xu's family members, who were already asleep, were awakened from their dreams and were bound by the robbers, who pointed sharp blades at them, forbidding them to make any noise. The robbers then freely searched for money, clothing, and other items, looting everything. The robbers were not satisfied and forced the victim to reveal the location of his hidden silver. Xu claimed that he had no money. The robbers, becoming enraged, suddenly had a bizarre idea: they stripped the male and female victims of their pants and burned their lower bodies with torches. Xu and his wife screamed in agony. The robbers stabbed Xu's legs several times and then fled with their loot, shouting and yelling. It is said that Xu's injuries were minor, but his wife, Li-shi, suffered severe burns to her lower body.</p>
<h3>Two Passengers Missing from British Ship from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>▲Telegram Sent to Hong Kong to Investigate</p>
<p>According to the Da Wan Bao, two passengers went missing on the British ship Kashgar on its way from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Their whereabouts are still unknown. The two men are named He Bo-lian (transliteration) and Liu Ze (transliteration). Both boarded the ship in Hong Kong but disappeared en route. The ship’s officers were immediately notified, and a thorough search of the entire ship was conducted for several hours. The two men's belongings were found, consisting only of a handbag. No letters were left behind. Inquiries were made to all the passengers, but no clues were found. Their luggage consisted only of a handbag and a basket of fruit, with nothing else. Based on this observation, it seems that they boarded the ship specifically to commit suicide by jumping into the sea. After the ship arrived in Shanghai today (the 14th), another thorough search of the entire ship was conducted, but no other clues were found. The company has now telegraphed Hong Kong, requesting that they investigate the background of the two men.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Volunteer Corps Review on the Previous Day</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps of the International Settlement is currently holding its annual review. Yesterday (the 13th), a parade was held, with over a thousand participants. Colonel Palmer, the commander-in-chief, led the way on horseback, followed by the infantry and the artillery in the rear. The parade started from the racetrack at 9:30 AM, turned onto Xizang Road, entered Baker Road, and followed Carter Road, McGregor Road, Connaught Road, Jiaozhou Road, Yuyuan Road, and Jing'an Temple Road before returning to the racetrack. Colonel Palmer reviewed the entire team at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Gordon Road. Although the day was cloudy, the corps members were spirited, their pace was neat, and their formation was excellent.</p>
<h3>County Public Security Bureau Detains Detective for Extortion</h3>
<p>▲Zhou Yue-ying Reports Harm</p>
<p>▲Gu Ji-gen's Lawlessness is Extreme</p>
<p>A rogue named Zhao A-fu recently harassed Zhou Yue-ying, a female performer at Xiaoshijie. During the dispute, a man named Gu Ji-gen, impersonating a detective from the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau, along with A-liang and Xiao-mao, intervened, detained Zhou Yue-ying, and extorted twenty yuan from her. Zhou reported this to the County Public Security Bureau. Director Shen was furious and believed that Gu's audacity to impersonate a detective and extort money was extremely lawless. He immediately ordered Detective Chief Qi Han-san to arrest Gu yesterday. After questioning him, he ordered that he be transferred to the court for punishment.</p>
<h3>City Public Utilities Bureau Guides Electric Company in Reorganizing High-Voltage Underground Cables</h3>
<p>In recent years, the China General Edison Company has been increasing its electricity supply, and the load has been increasing daily. The existing circuits in various locations are insufficient. In order to meet the needs, the company recently built a new substation No. 1 at the intersection of Guohuo Road and Puyu New Road, which has been completed. It is now planning to add and replace high-voltage underground cables on various routes, mainly: (1) Adding electrical cables between the power plant, substation No. 11, and the new and old substations No. 1. (2) Burying a cable from the factory to the proposed substation No. 24 on Jumen Road. (3) Replacing the cable to the Jiangnan Shipyard and adding another cable as a backup line for the domestic water company. (4) Adding equipment lines to the arsenal substation. (5) Connecting the proposed substation No. 25 behind the manufacturing bureau to substations No. 1 and No. 14. (6) Replacing the original cables between substations No. 2 and No. 11 and between substations No. 11 and No. 7 and removing the underground cables from the power plant to the old No. 1 substation and from the old No. 1 substation to No. 2 substation. The City Public Utilities Bureau reviewed the plan and deemed it generally appropriate, but noted that there were points to be supplemented, such as the submission of diagrams for the new substations that have been built or are to be built for verification, and that common and standby cables should not be buried in the same location. If they cannot be separated, the burial method should be improved. The bureau also suggested extending the standby line to the arsenal to substation No. 24 to serve as a backup line for that substation as well. The bureau has issued its comments and ordered the company to comply accordingly.</p>
<h3>Achievements of Qianyi Traumatology Hospital</h3>
<p>The Qianyi Traumatology Hospital in Zhabei was founded by philanthropists Chen Bing-qian and Wang Bin-yan, specializing in the treatment of traumatic injuries and internal and external rheumatism. It provides completely free treatment and does not charge fees. Its director, Mr. Zhang De-yi, treats patients, regardless of their wealth, with the utmost sincerity. His skills are miraculous. Western doctors find it difficult to deal with broken backs and fractured legs, or even require amputation, but once treated by the famous doctor Zhang, life and limbs can be preserved without pain. His wife, Ms. Zheng Ying, is also skilled in medicine and assists Mr. Zhang in this charitable cause. Her contribution is not small. Therefore, the hospital's operations have been developing in recent years, and the threshold for seeking treatment is being crossed. There is no fixed fund for its operating expenses; it relies entirely on fundraising. The local philanthropist Mr. Du Yue-sheng donates a huge sum of 300 yuan per month. There are also many other sporadic donations. If it is still not enough, Chen, Wang, and Zhang will contribute from their own pockets. This kind of charitable organization is second to none in Shanghai, so people in society praise it. On the occasion of the fifth anniversary, a report on the achievements was submitted. After reviewing the photos of major injuries that have been treated, it is clear that there is a magical technique to bring the dead back to life and preserve the body. The above are the small photos of Mr. and Mrs. Zhang.</p>
<h3>City Finance Bureau Sets Date for Bidding for Hog Slaughter Inspection Fee</h3>
<p>The hog slaughter inspection fee in this city has been collected by representatives elected by the hog merchants, who are responsible for reporting to the City Finance Bureau. Recently, disputes have arisen among the merchants, who have sued each other, causing the merchant representative Yang Wei-you to report to the Finance Bureau that he resigned from his position of paying the inspection fee on April 2. It is heard that the Finance Bureau has submitted a bid to the City Government, inviting merchants to contract for the job. Therefore, on the one hand, it ordered the representative Yang Wei-you to still be responsible for collecting and reporting the fees, and on the other hand, it set the bidding date for the 19th of this month. When the bids are opened, the City Government will send personnel to supervise the process in order to ensure caution.</p>
<h3>City Landscape Garden Director Wu Jue-nong Resigns</h3>
<p>▲Orders Bao Bo-du to Act as Agent</p>
<p>Wu Jue-nong, the director of the City Landscape Garden and the director of the Agricultural Experiment Station, has resigned from the Social Affairs Bureau due to illness. Director Pan believed that Mr. Wu's performance has been remarkable since taking office, so he did not approve his resignation but granted him a leave of absence for half a year. Bao Bo-du was appointed to act as his agent for the remaining affairs, and the matter was submitted to the City Government for approval, which has been ordered to be approved.</p>
<h3>Problem of Relaxation of Rickshaw Licenses in the Concessions</h3>
<p>▲Zheng Li-min Represents the Petition</p>
<p>▲Chen Jia-chang Goes to Negotiate</p>
<p>Rickshaw dealer Zheng Li-min previously complained that the rickshaw merchant association of the Public Concession monopolized rickshaw licenses, resulting in uneven distribution among rickshaw dealers. He also noted that the number of rickshaw pullers was increasing daily, resulting in a shortage of vehicles and frequent quarrels and fights over pulling rickshaws. He had taken film footage of the brawls and had repeatedly submitted petitions to the Shanghai Special City Government, requesting that the British Concession Authorities be consulted to relax the issuance of rickshaw licenses in order to meet the demand and maintain the livelihoods of the poor. The City Government sent personnel to consult with the Concession Authorities, but the Concession Authorities stated that the board of directors had already decided on the issue of relaxing the licenses. Under the current circumstances, there was no need to relax the licenses, and there was even the possibility of reducing the number of licenses in the future. The City Government clearly issued an order on the matter. Now, Zheng Li-min has submitted the film of the brawls over rickshaws, along with a detailed account of the number of rickshaw pullers unemployed in Shanghai, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that it grant relief and promptly consult with the British Concession Authorities to cancel the quota of 5,161 rickshaw licenses stipulated in 1924 and issue a sufficient number to save the lives of the common people. Minister Wang read the petition and understood the situation. Yesterday, he instructed Director Chen of the Shanghai Office to consult with the British Concession Authorities to increase the number of rickshaw licenses in order to maintain the livelihood of the common people.</p>

<h3>Man Speaking Nonsense with Reactionary Leaflets in his Possession</h3>
<p>▲Claims to Have Picked them up from the Ground</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a young man, wearing short clothes, was walking along Lan-ni Ferry in Pudong when he suddenly suffered a nervous breakdown and was talking to himself, displaying both joy and anger. Lang Xun-ling, a policeman from the Third District of the Public Security Bureau, saw him and went forward to question him. The man was talking nonsense. Several dozens of reactionary leaflets, two dollars in large bills, four dimes in small bills, and a copper tag were found on his person. He was taken to the district office. He claimed to be Yu Wen-sheng, twenty-six years old, from Tongzhou, and lived in a thatched hut at the Fenshan Wharf in Pudong, working as a rickshaw puller. When asked where the leaflets came from, he said he picked them up from the ground. The district chief verified the testimony and ordered that his family members be summoned to investigate the truth of the matter.</p>
<h3>Interrogation of Bandits Repeatedly Involved in Kidnapping Cases</h3>
<p>Yan Ru-ling, a Ningbo native and comprador of the former French-owned Oriental Fur Company, residing at No. 1325 Lafayette Road in the French Concession, was kidnapped from his new home on the 23rd of last month and held in a bandit den at No. 356 Jin Shen-fu Road. The case was investigated by the special agency detectives and supervisors of the French police, Jin Jiu-lin, detectives Li Yao-long, Mao Jin-gen, Qian Yu-min, and patrolmen Zhou Yao-ting, Zhou Bing-cheng, Zhang Zi-ying, Zhou Bu-guang, and Qin You-yu, who went to the bandit den, captured the kidnappers Zhang Hong-xiang, Lu Pei-zhou, Wang A-song, Fang You-shan, Tao Jin-bao, Luo Shi-sheng, Chen Lian-gen, Wang A-da, and the person involved, Zhao Ren-mao, a total of nine people. They also confiscated three handguns, one Mauser pistol, and more than twenty bullets, rescued the victim, and took them to the police station. The victim was escorted home. The matter has been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, they were sent to the French court for investigation. Judge Zhu Qi, together with French Consul Du He, presided over the criminal court for interrogation. Detective Supervisor Jin Jiu-lin was the first to go to court to report the situation, saying that the defendants had successively kidnapped Lu Cheng-yao, a wealthy businessman on Lafayette Road, and Qian Chang-gan, from No. 5 Xixianfang, West Ames Road, and divided the ransom money. He also said that the first defendant, Zhang Hong-xiang, had committed theft six or seven years ago, was detained, and sentenced to five years. He had not been released for long before committing another serious crime. When they went to arrest them, they opened fire to resist arrest. He asked for strict investigation and presented the handguns and Mauser pistol. Next, Attorney Ba He, representing the plaintiff Yan Ru-ling, described the kidnapping and interrogated Zhang Hong-xiang, who stated that he was forty-three years old, a native of Tongzhou, and had committed a crime before and been dealt with by the court. This time, Lu Pei-zhou invited him to Anle Palace on March 10 to discuss kidnapping the plaintiff, Yan Ru-ling, because Yan was the father-in-law of Lu Pei-zhou's brother, Lu Cheng-yao, so he knew that Yan had considerable wealth. First, Lu accompanied Wu to Lafayette Road to identify Yan Ru-ling's appearance. Then, a civilian borrowed a car with the number 1920 from Chen Lian-gen and changed the number to 2921. He then invited the fugitive Dai Qing-yun and Fang You-shan, Tao Jin-bao, and Luo Shi-sheng to go there on the 22nd, disguised as painters, and waited inside for a long time. When they did not see the plaintiff arrive, they returned to the inn. The next day, they went again, still disguised as painters and working inside. Soon, the plaintiff arrived. He and Dai Qing-yun each took out handguns, first threatening the bodyguard and seizing his handgun. Then, they dragged the plaintiff onto their car and sent him to No. 356 Jin Shen-fu Road to hide. He did not know how the detectives were arrested by a civilian at No. 769 Taolin Lane, Chengdu Road. The civilian accompanied the patrolman to Jin Shen-fu Road to rescue the victim. He did not know how they opened fire to resist arrest. He also said that he was not present at the kidnapping of Qian Chang-gan, although he had also received 300 yuan in the division of the spoils. This time, he knew the law and broke the law, and his crime was unforgivable. If the court sentenced him to death, he had a wife and young children who relied on him. However, his cousin Zhang Fu-qing owed him 400 yuan and eight small cars. He asked to summon his cousin to court to recover the money and hand over the cars to his wife for living expenses. The Chinese and Western officials approved it. Lu Pei-zhou stated that he was a native of Tongzhou. The previous year, Zhang A-si, who was still at large, proposed and discussed the matter with him to kidnap his brother Lu Cheng-yao. Afterwards, he received 2,000 yuan in the division of the spoils. Then he continued to kidnap Qian Chang-gan and received 800 yuan. On March 10 of the same year, he proposed and invited Zhang Hong-xiang to kidnap his relative Yan Ru-ling, but he was not present at the time. Wang A-gen stated that he had been working as a partner in a certain company. A few days ago, a friend Xu A-bao invited him to go out to see a play. After the play, Xu tricked him to a place on Bedan Road, where several accomplices ganged up on him, beat him, and shot him in the right arm. Afterwards, he went to Tongde Hospital for treatment. The French patrolman found out that he was an accomplice in the kidnapping of the plaintiff, which was a complete injustice. At this point, Supervisor Jin said that he saw the defendant Wang A-gen opening fire to resist arrest that day. They also opened fire to fight back, wounding his arm. Wang fled with his injury and sought treatment at the hospital. He was found and arrested. Zhang Hong-xiang testified that it was Wang A-gen who drove the car when kidnapping the plaintiff. Chen Lian-gen stated that he was working as a driver for the Li family. On March 23, his friend Zhang Hong-xiang came to borrow the car, saying he was loading opium. He did not know about the kidnapping. The rest of his statement was evasive. Fang You-shan, Tao Jin-bao, Luo Shi-sheng, and Wang A-da all stated that they had been invited by Zhang Hong-xiang to go to the plaintiff's new home and pretend to be painters. Later, they were in the bandit den guarding the victim. Zhao Ren-mao stated that he was driving a car and knew nothing about the case. He asked for leniency. After consultation, the Chinese and Western officials ordered that the defendants be detained and await further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Extortion Case Appeal</h3>
<p>Zhou Fugen and Wang Ziqing, formerly near Broadway Road in Yangshupu, were arrested for extorting money from Xu Yongqing. They were handed over to the former Provisional Court for trial. Zhou was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment, and Wang to one year and eight months. Dissatisfied, the two convicts hired Lawyer Fan Gang to appeal. Yesterday afternoon, Song Yuan, the Presiding Judge of the High Court's Criminal Division, along with Judges Ye Zaigi and Gao Junxiang, opened the court for a retrial. Chief Prosecutor Wang also attended to perform his duties. After clarifying the facts in court, arguments began. First, Lawyer Fan spoke on behalf of the two appellants, Zhou and Wang. The police lawyer, Gan Jingxian, also wanted to respond, but the Presiding Judge stated that the case did not require the police to present their case, as it was not related to the police. The lawyer argued that the case was initially prosecuted by the police, so he still requested permission to express his opinion. If an oral statement was not allowed, he would submit a written statement. The court then granted the lawyer permission to respond. Later, Zhou and Wang were ordered to be returned to custody, and the date for sentencing was set.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Commits Suicide Due to Economic Hardship</h3>
<p>Qian Haihai, a rickshaw puller, lived at No. 2 Dongxing Lane, Disiwei Road, Zhabei. He was 38 years old and from Danyang. Due to the oppression of his living environment and extreme poverty, he became weary of life. The day before yesterday afternoon, he committed suicide by consuming opium. The second landlord, Shi Lifu, reported the incident to the First Precinct of the Fifth District. Yesterday, he ordered the local guarantor, Li Xubao, to report to the District Court for an examination. Prosecutor Li and others arrived at the scene to conduct the examination and arrange for the burial.</p>
<h3>Ai Hanming Dies by Poisoning</h3>
<p>▲Distressed that His Wife Did Not Return, He Resorted to This</p>
<p>Ai Hanming, 22 years old, from Jiading, worked at the Hongkou Cigarette Factory. His wife, Zhou, also 22, from Huangdu, had been married for over three years but had not yet had children. The couple's relationship was known to be very close. Ai found it difficult to make a living in his hometown, so in September of last year, he brought his wife to Shanghai and rented a loft room in the flat-roofed house of the second landlord, Su Weisheng, at the intersection of Singapore Road in West Shanghai. They lived together. After Ai started working at the cigarette factory, he would return home every two or three days for the night, which became his habit. Zhou also went to work at a nearby sock factory but soon stopped. However, Ai's monthly wages were very meager, and he often worried about not being able to make ends meet. As a result, the couple inevitably had some quarrels. At the beginning of last month, during an argument, Ai, filled with resentment, bought opium paste in an attempt to commit suicide. Fortunately, he was discovered early and saved by a doctor. Later, Zhou, seeing the high cost of living and the meager wages of her husband, and hoping to reduce the burden, agreed with her husband in the middle of last month to go out and work as a servant for a few months, then find another way. Thus, Zhou went to work as a servant for the Chen family at No. 70 Cunchan Lane, Wujiaochang, near their home. Ai would return home every few days to reunite with his wife. The day before yesterday (the 13th) at 6:00 PM, Ai returned home from the factory and went to bed in the loft. After a while, he called out to the second landlord, Su, and asked him to go to the Chen family in Cunchan Lane and ask his wife, Zhou, to return home immediately because he suddenly felt unwell and it could not be delayed. Su went immediately to tell her, but Zhou refused to return home, saying, "What is wrong with him? Let him die if he wants to!" Su then relayed this response. Soon after, Su, living below the loft, only heard Ai sighing and breathing, assuming it was because he was upset that his wife would not return. When the clock struck nine, the second landlord, Su, suddenly felt that Ai was quiet and silent. He took a lamp up to the loft and saw Ai lying motionless. He called out to him, but there was no response. His face was already purple, and his breath was faint. Greatly alarmed, he knew that Ai had taken poison. Su immediately called his wife to return home and then reported to the Sixth District Police Station. Upon receiving the report, Section Chief Duan immediately sent police to take the poisoned man, Zhou, the second landlord Su Weisheng, and the lodger Jin Xinggui back to the district. The poisoned man was immediately sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment. After examination by the doctor, it was confirmed that he had consumed opium paste. However, because the dose was too large and the time was too late, he was in a near-death state and could not be saved. He died at 0:30 AM yesterday. Yesterday morning, Section Chief Duan conducted separate interrogations. The second landlord, Su Weisheng, testified that he was 27 years old and from Changzhou. The lodger, Jin Xinggui, testified that he was 35 years old and from Linhai. Ai Zhou, the wife of the deceased, testified that she was 22 years old and from Huangdu. She also presented a note written by her husband, Ai Hanming, before the incident (the note read: "Owes A Chang 6 yuan at No. 1022, Lane 2, Huade Lane, Hed Road, must be repaid in full without delay"). After receiving the testimonies, Section Chief Duan ordered that Zhou be temporarily detained and instructed the local guarantor, Tan Hefu, to report to the District Court and request that someone be sent to examine the body for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Chen Yuemei and Wu Dekang Fight Over Child</h3>
<p>▲The Legal Wife Suddenly Arrives</p>
<p>▲Scissors Are Drawn</p>
<p>Chen Yuemei, a 24-year-old woman from Ningbo, lost her parents early and had no property or relatives to rely on. Her situation was dire. After a long time, her livelihood became increasingly difficult. She met Wu Dekang, a Wuxi native who worked at the Rongxing Machinery Factory. Wu, noticing that the woman was beautiful, gradually seduced her, falsely claiming that he was not yet married. The woman also needed support, so she complied, and they fell in love and lived together at No. 19 Meiji Lane, Triangle Street, Nanshi. When the woman realized that Wu already had a legal wife living in his hometown, she silently acknowledged that the die was cast and could only wait and see what happened. More than four years had passed, and she had given birth to a son who was already three years old, and was still six months pregnant. Unexpectedly, in the middle of last month, Wu's wife suddenly came to Shanghai from her hometown, pretending to be visiting. Wu feared that the woman might change her mind because of this, so he gave his three-year-old son to his wife to take home. The woman was furious upon learning the truth, and the two sides often argued, demanding the return of the child, but to no avail. At approximately 7:00 PM the day before yesterday, another conflict broke out over the child. Wu was also enraged and grabbed a pair of scissors from the table, intending to stab her. Fortunately, Fang Zaihao, a Ningbo native living with them, saw it and rushed to stop him. Fearing a major disaster, he went outside and called Wang Ganchen, the security guard of the 25th Post, to come. They took the man and woman back to the First Precinct of the First District. During the preliminary hearing by the chief, the woman requested a divorce. He ordered that a document be prepared and sent to the Shanghai District Court for review.</p>

<h3>Labor Statistics Work and Plans (Continued)</h3>
<p>▲Shanghai Special City Social Bureau</p>
<p>(D) Survey of Workers' Living Standards: The survey of workers' lives has at least two main purposes. The first is to understand the living environment of workers and the minimum living expenses of a worker's family. The second is to obtain the goods and quantities that should be included in the cost of living index. According to economic principles, work efficiency and living environment are closely related. For example, workers who have a comfortable life, proper physical and mental development, and education are generally more efficient and capable than workers who have poor living environments and no education. Their productivity is naturally also greater. Therefore, if workers can have a comfortable living environment and receive considerable education, the overall national economy can increase a great deal of production. This is the biggest reason we want to study the living conditions of workers. Recently, the National Government promulgated the Factory Law, which stipulates that the minimum wage for workers should be based on the living conditions of local workers. Therefore, a survey of living standards is even more urgent. However, what are the current living conditions of workers? Are they able to enjoy the benefits of modern material civilization equally? What is the minimum living cost for an average worker's family? These questions cannot be clarified without a cost of living survey. In this survey, we need to know at least the following items: the distribution of workers' families by population, age, gender, and occupation; the sources and amount of income; the average household expenditure on food, clothing, housing, lighting and fuel, and other expenses; the average number of people living in each room; and the minimum living cost. (E) Cost of Living Index and Real Wage Index: The survey of living standards and the cost of living index are different. The former is a static survey that investigates the living conditions of workers in a certain period. The latter is a dynamic survey that investigates the historical trends of changes in living expenses. We all know that the prices of consumer goods often fluctuate due to market supply and demand. When prices rise, the cost of living is high. When prices fall, the cost of living is low. Therefore, the cost of living changes with the rise and fall of prices. The cost of living index is based on the results of the survey of living standards. According to the consumption of various items, the weight of each item in the index is determined. Then, its price is investigated to find the cost of maintaining the original living standard compared with the base year. Thus, an index is compiled. Therefore, with the cost of living index, we can know whether this year's cost of living is higher or lower than the base year by a certain percentage. It is most fair to solve the wage problem based on this. It is best to compile a separate classification index for food expenses, housing expenses, clothing expenses, lighting and fuel expenses, and miscellaneous expenses to observe the individual changes in each category of consumption. The total index is formed by combining the various classification indexes, which represents the changes in the general cost of living. The cost of living index has a purpose, which is to measure the strength of the purchasing power of money to find the real wage index. When prices rise, the value of money falls or the purchasing power is weak. When prices fall, the value of money rises or the purchasing power is strong. The wages that workers earn are used to buy supplies to maintain their lives. However, since the purchasing power of money often changes, the real value of wages also increases or decreases accordingly. For example, if it used to be possible to maintain a living with a wage of 30 yuan, if prices rise by 20 percent, then 36 yuan is now required because the value of 36 yuan is equivalent to the previous 30 yuan. In other words, items that used to cost 30 yuan now cost 36 yuan to buy. Therefore, if we want to ensure that the actual value of wages does not change, then in addition to compiling a money wage index, we must also consider the increase or decrease in the purchasing power of money. Since the cost of living index is a thermometer for measuring the purchasing power of money, dividing the cost of living index by the money wage index and then multiplying by 100 yields the real wage index. The meaning is the index that measures the change in the real value of wages. Since the real wage index can indicate whether the wages that workers receive are sufficient to maintain their original living standards, we can easily plan remedial methods. (F) Industrial Accidents: Under the machine production system, unexpected accidents during work are almost inevitable for workers. This directly harms the workers themselves. On the factory side, losses are also significant, such as machine damage, injury compensation, replacement of novices, and reduced production efficiency. All of these things are also indirectly a loss to society. Recently, industrial accidents in various countries have received great attention, and efforts are being made to improve disaster prevention and preparation. However, to understand the root causes and prevent them, statistics must be relied upon. Important items include the number of accidents and people in each industry, the causes of accidents, the nature of the accidents, the injured parts, the degree, the number of days, the number of work hours and wages lost due to injury, and the cost of pensions.

<h3>Random Thoughts on Spring Outings</h3>
<p>— Yang Jia Yi</p>
<p>▲There is a true and false distinction in spring outings. Artists' spring outings are the truest, while lovers' spring outings are the falsest.</p>
<p>▲If you like to take a cursory look, then you should not go on a spring outing. Because if you do, the truly beautiful scenery of nature will be far away from you.</p>
<p>▲When going on a spring outing, you must not be lazy. Because if you are lazy, your legs will not be willing to stroll leisurely.</p>

<h3>A Record of Distinguished Guests Enjoying Scenic Spots</h3>
<p>— Bai Xi</p>
<p>Spring's chill is accompanied by frequent rains. I am beset by both laziness and illness. The floral season is nearing its end, yet I still hesitate to don my wax-soled shoes. Suddenly, my old friend Jiezi returns from Jinling. Passing through Liangxi, he makes a brief stop, and sends a telegram inviting the renowned journalist Zhang Zhuping to come to Wuxi and travel together. The day Mr. Zhang arrived coincided with the Qingming Festival according to the old lunar calendar. After a long spell of rain, the weather suddenly cleared, and a gentle breeze blew. My spring travel plans, stirred by the arrival of a distinguished guest, were suddenly set in motion. Accompanying Zhang were his wife Yunqing, Miss Zhu Yidi, and Miss Zhang Huanfen, the principal of Rong's Girls' School, all of whom I had known for some time. We arranged a banquet at the Da Xin Restaurant to welcome them, and also invited Mr. and Mrs. Tang Moubo Yu Qingtang to accompany us, as the guests and the Tangs had the bonds of being from the same hometown and schoolmates. Meeting old friends, our enjoyment was doubled. I and Tiao Fu Mengdie arrived last, intending to be hasty hosts but instead becoming unexpected guests. We then arranged an evening banquet at Plum Garden. In the afternoon, we went to the garden to make all the preparations. Jiezi accompanied the guests to Huishan Park to sample tea and then climbed Xishan Longguang Pagoda to take in the sights of Huilu. Then they passed through Zhang Lane to visit Dongda Pond, and then to Huanfen's villa, returning to the garden when tired.</p>
<h3>A Romantic Tale of Red Beans</h3>
<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>Since Wang Mojie wrote about the red bean, it has been known as the seed of longing and has been woven into the works of countless poets and lyricists throughout the ages. However, this plant originates from Lingnan, and it is not easy for us to see it. Only the residence of Qian Muzhai of Yushan has a red bean tree, hence the name Red Bean Villa and the self-appellation Red Bean Elder. To this day, the tree still stands, surpassing any old family's tall trees. One evening after Qingming, my friend Xie Jiezi hosted guests in Wuxi at the Plum Garden. Among the guests was Mr. Yang, who took out a pair of red beans from his pocket, saying he had just bought them from Yushan. The pair of beans were brightly red and adorable, round and flat in shape, and as shiny as coral. The guests passed them around for viewing. Mr. Yang told me that each pod of this bean produces one seed, but occasionally there are two seeds. Their shapes also vary in size. Only those that are of the same size and come from the same pod are considered a pair of red beans, hence they are especially rare and precious. It is said among scholars that if a husband and wife each wear one of a pair of red beans, they will be husband and wife for generations to come, which is even better than the inlaid box in the Hall of Eternal Life. Is it the owner's story and promotion of the beans that make them rare, or is it the deep affection between the couple that makes them a symbol of unity, creating an indissoluble bond, or is it something inherent in the beans themselves? It is certainly better than wearing daylilies to wish for sons or Albizia flowers to dispel worries. This is the first time in my life that I have seen red beans, and Jiezi happened to ask for a poem about red beans. I wrote about red beans and then saw red beans. Such a wonderful coincidence, could it be a predestined connection? However, with princes and fragrant grasses, travelers at the ends of the earth, urgent urgings of spring, and a wild wind sweeping the scene, the peach blossoms have all fallen, the swallows have not returned, the red bean poem is complete, and my green shirt is wet with tears. I send it to Juan Gong for confirmation, fearing that the soul of the cuckoo will be emaciated and that my dream of butterflies will be confused, both sharing the same feeling of sadness for spring.</p>
<p>Slow Tune of Double Red Beans (Following Jiezi's rhyme, the original poem was previously published in this column) Deep spring in the south, news from the east wind is cut off. A tree full of longing. Remembering songs in the palace, lyrics spread in the boudoir. The joyous and sorrowful events, only the lover knows. It is hard to maintain the thread, a vain entanglement of a wisp of infatuation. Two branches sprout from the heart, like weeping pearls, congealing on the pillow. Seeing the mandarin ducks being driven away, the parrot is fed leftovers. The child only knows how to steal pleasures. More sorrow is planted in the womb, the more delicate, the more hesitant. The sweet dream returns, picking it up again, the gentle soul wants to fly. Comforting the estranged, adding to a small ailing life.</p>
<h3>People Without Birthdays</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>▲ A Major Problem Amidst the Call for Calendar Reform</p>
<p>In Western countries, the calendar reform committee, seeking to unify the world's calendar, has recently created a new calendar with thirteen months in a year, each month with twenty-eight days. There is one extra day, which is a public holiday. It has now been decided to implement it from January 1933. However, once this calendar is implemented, people whose birthdays fall after the twenty-eighth, on the twenty-ninth, thirtieth, or thirty-first, will have no birthday to celebrate. And in the future, babies born on a public holiday will have no way to name their month and day.</p>
<p>February in the Gregorian calendar has twenty-eight days, with a leap year every four years, and twenty-nine days in a leap year. However, people born on February 29th only have a birthday once every four years, which Westerners consider unfortunate. With the new calendar, people born after the twenty-eighth will never have a birthday, which is surely a great misfortune. This is also a major problem amidst the call for calendar reform.</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemum Cultivation Improvement Method</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lei</p>
<p>Chrysanthemums of various colors will now be propagated by division and cuttings. As the saying goes, "Don't ask about the harvest, just ask about the cultivation." This applies to growing grains, and it also applies to growing ornamental flowers. In the past, gardeners often broke off the heads of chrysanthemum branches, about three feet long, some only four inches, and planted them in clusters in pots. After they sprouted roots, they would then divide them and plant one branch per pot. After planting, their vitality was often hampered for half a month, because the roots were separated from the soil during division and were injured. Last year, I heard that someone was good at growing chrysanthemums, making them large and flowery, so I visited him and asked him to teach me his good method. He said, "It's not difficult, just correct the gardener's mistakes. It's better to plant one branch per pot, without transplanting, to avoid repeated damage. Mix three parts chaff into the soil (the chaff from rice mills, usually used for feeding pigs). The pot should be larger so that the roots can stretch. Break off a chrysanthemum branch about four inches long and remove the top, about an inch or so, and then insert it into the pot. It will take root in half a month. Since the top was removed earlier, three branches will sprout. After the three branches have grown slightly, remove the tops of the three branches again, so that each branch will sprout three branches, for a total of nine branches. Each will have a terminal flower, so a total of nine flowers can bloom. The chaff mixed into the soil earlier is fertilizer. Later, fertilize it again, and the nine flowers will be large and different from ordinary ones. Now that the spring rain is like ointment, and the chrysanthemum buds are plump, the day for picking and inserting chrysanthemum heads is near. I am relaying what I heard from a chrysanthemum grower to those who are addicted to the eastern fence."</p>
<h3>Bedbugs Kill People</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>I have often talked about bedbugs. Although the insects are small, their harm is significant enough to kill. Someone named Qi, ten years ago when his master was still alive, was addicted to opium. Every night, he would not sleep until two or three o'clock, and he would order a maid to stay by his side to serve him. The maid, A Cui, was only twelve or thirteen years old, and she could not hold out in the middle of the night. She would often doze off in a rattan-bound armchair in front of the opium couch. This went on for more than two years. A Cui's face was bloodless, and she looked haggard. She thought it was caused by insomnia. At that time, the master treated his servants like animals and did not care. Later, she became more and more haggard and eventually died. The master, thinking of the chair in front of the couch as something A Cui had sat and slept on before her death, planned to move it elsewhere. This chair had not been moved for more than ten years. When the chair was moved and the cushion fell off, he saw a wriggling mass inside. Upon closer inspection, it was bedbugs. He did not know how many there were. He scooped them up and got about a liter's worth. He burned the chair along with them. Only then did he realize that A Cui's death was actually due to the bites of bedbugs. Her blood had been gradually sucked dry. He had often seen her twitching her body when she was dozing off. She was young and ignorant and did not try to catch them. She was overworked and had her blood sucked. After years of accumulation, how could she not die? How unjust!</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from Southeast Asia (13)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>▲ From Saigon to Singapore</p>
<p>On the morning of February 18th, at six o'clock, the ship left Saigon. Men and women on the shore were seeing us off. But since this is French territory, most of those boarding the ship are French, very few are British, and none are Chinese. This is strange. Besides me and Mr. Chen Kaiqing, there was only one female doctor, Kuang Cibei. Kuang's father is the director of the Dongshan Hospital in Guangzhou. Eleven members of her family are in the medical profession. Her sister is now in France. Although Kuang has already obtained a doctor's certificate in China, she still wants to study in Germany. She said that her sister has already rented a room for her in France, and the monthly rent is only about 30 Chinese silver dollars.</p>
<p>Life on a ship at sea is another kind of life. Mail ships are considered superior ships. The first and second class cabins are luxuriously decorated with fresh flowers. They are served by Western maids, like the use of maids in Japan. There are movie theaters, concerts, and dance halls. In the chairs, one can whistle to the sea and sky, or play various games on the deck. The square is boundless. The men and women are all sea immortals. The third class cabins also have electric fans, running water, and a large dining room. Ladies and gentlemen can read, write, and play the organ. The fourth class is also comparable to the cabins on the Yangtze River. As for the foreign workers and sailors, their lives and clothing are still crude, far from equal. The room servants are mostly Chinese on ships that travel through China and Southeast Asia and around the world. Unfortunately, they all speak Min and Cantonese, which are not easy to understand. But we cannot help but admire the creative power of the Min and Cantonese people in the world. Wherever there is sunlight, there are overseas Chinese, even in Australia. And most of the overseas Chinese are Min and Cantonese. Their employment as room servants allows them to travel the globe, implicitly occupying a major force in the world labor sector. Isn't that great?</p>
<p>On the 19th, the climate south of Saigon was completely summer. Saigon is already ten degrees north of the tropics. Traveling further south, the lined clothes could no longer be worn, and no one wore long clothes. On the ship, there were Indians who wore a long cloth skirt over their right shoulder, the color was light black, and their heads were wrapped in colored floral cloth. They sat in the scattered cabins, supported by cloth tents. Some could speak Chinese. Mr. Chen Kaiqing said that Indian businessmen are good at business. In Burma, there is a Chinese street, and the Indians face them in business, but the Chinese all fail. I asked, "Is it because the Indians are united in resisting the Chinese?" He said, "No, it's a natural failure." I asked, "Why?" He said, "They are very frugal in employing people, eating bread and drinking water, more diligent and thrifty than the Chinese. They also don't care much about appearances. They don't pay attention to the appearance of their houses and living quarters. Our Chinese are a little more wealthy, so we become lax and pay attention to appearances. We are also generous to our employees. As a result, the Chinese business fails, and the Indian business becomes rich." I said, "What will they do after they become rich?" He replied, "They also lack knowledge, and they only seek more wealth, and they are still stingy." I said, "This is what Westerners call a Jew. The Western meaning of a Jew is a money slave, referring to their lack of other thoughts. Looking at the efforts of Jews and Indians to get rich, and the lack of national and cultural movements, our nation must encourage itself. If the country and culture are not competitive, even if you are rich, you are still a slave, which is sad. I especially hope that the rich people of our country pay attention to this."</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (171)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 10: The Scarlet Flames Leap to the Sky, the Courtesan Is a Filial Daughter; Red Carpet on the Ground, Meeting Celebrated Actors Instantly. At that time, many people also opened the water taps in the kitchen courtyards and filled buckets with water to pour on the fire. It was truly a drop in the bucket. Many neighbors also neglected the matter of putting out the fire. They only cared about moving their own boxes and belongings from their homes. The alleys were already crowded with many people, and adding to that were the objects being moved out by each family. Some were casually placed in the alleys. The objects being moved out were not complete items. Bedding and quilts were rolled together, and the items from the bed were scattered on the ground. Some also took down the curtains. For a time, the sounds of shouts big and small mixed together. Ruiyun's mother and aunt were anxious, constantly chanting "Amitabha, Amitabha," and complaining to A Jin, "Why are you still just watching? Why don't you help me pack the boxes?" A Jin said, "I'm so anxious that I don't know where to start. Which box should I pack?" At this time, Ruiyun returned, luckily having removed all her jewelry and hair ornaments and placed them in a small official box. This small official box was locked, and the key was always kept by the aunt. That had always been the case. A Jin said, "Then is your jewelry box packed?" The aunt said, "It's already packed." A Jin said, "That's good. Your property is all in this jewelry box anyway." The aunt said, "There are also clothes. Can't we just ignore them? Anan's clothes are not few either." A Jin said, "Where can we find time to pack those clothes now?" Zuo Shichen said, "Pack the important things. Let the unimportant things be. The Shanghai fire department is very fast. In a moment, the fire truck will arrive. This place is still separated by a small alley and two houses. I think it's all right." Just as he was speaking, they heard a series of ringing bells. Everyone said that the Municipal Council's fire truck had arrived. They saw many foreigners and Chinese in the fire department wearing golden copper helmets and fire-fighting uniforms, with leather boots that extended over their knees. They arrived in the alley and drove away the idle people who were watching the fire, clearing a path and dragging in a very thick leather hose. They attached it to the water tap. In a moment, they saw the leather hose, which was originally flat, gradually become full and fat, turning into a round bamboo tube. First, several firefighters placed ladders on the overhanging buildings, and one by one they went up, with axes and chisels attached to their waists. The windows were originally closed, but with one axe, they were split open. They inserted the leather hose. Other hoses also sucked up enough water and sprayed it towards the side where the fire was leaping out. In a moment, the fire's momentum weakened, and the fire's power subsided. Ruiyun and her group of little sisters were still children after all. They had never seen Shanghai fire fighting before. They stood on the veranda and found it amusing. They weren't anxious at all. As the saying goes, "It's fun to watch a fire burn, but it's hard on the people who are being affected."</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Markets Gradually Entering a Tired State</h3>
<p>▲ Turning from High to Low, Ultimately Trending Towards Weariness. Yesterday's gold market was rather mediocre, with only a tael or two of ups and downs. Both the official and black market exchange rates were slightly looser. Trading in the market was sluggish. Ruoyuan Chengyong and Yu Da were slightly more aggressive in buying, while Taixing and Shunli were selling. However, the early morning started high due to the Sunday's telegraphic exchange rate being unchanged, briefly breaking through the 500 tael mark. But sellers were active, and it was just a flash in the pan, immediately falling, sharply dropping by more than two taels. Afterwards, there was a fluctuation of one tael. The exchange rate was firm but then weakened, and it was flat at noon. However, spot gold tenders and bank trading were still strong, totaling over a thousand bars. Later, the market became even more peaceful, fluctuating by only about a tael. Shunli advanced slightly, while Yiyu and Yufa Yong, etc., sold, advancing and retreating around 99 taels. In the end, it fell slightly.</p>
<p>▲ The Second Market Briefly Broke Through the 500 Tael Mark. Due to the lack of telegraphic information at the beginning of the week for London silver bars and exchange rates, the opening of the May tender rose by nine mace to 499 taels and 8 mace, followed by 500 taels and 0.003 mace. There seemed to be more buyers, and sentiment was still firm. Afterwards, sellers were strong, suddenly seeing a downward turn. The raw market immediately returned to 98 taels. The exchange rate eased. Mitsui bought forward-dated Japanese gold at 1 tael and 0.035 mace. The bank did a deal for June British gold at 11 pence and 0.375. The initial announcement had already increased by 1.25, US dollars increased by 2.5, and Japanese gold was quoted at a small 0.625, but it was unmoved, at 98 taels and 45 mace, as Mitsui bought spot goods. Then, Mitsui absorbed forward-dated Japanese gold at 1 tael and 0.035625, so it added two more taels, around ten o'clock, it was 9 taels 23 mace. Later, the exchange rate weakened, and the near-term British gold was done by Huahank at 11 pence and 0.25. Mitsui entered forward-dated Japanese gold at 1 tael and 0.034375. Spot positions were actively sold on the table, gradually depreciating by one tael. At 11:15, it was only 8 taels and 3 mace. After entering, it was extremely flat. At 11:45, it increased by several cash, as Fuchang and Yu Da, etc., were chasing after it. The noon closing was 99 taels. April British gold at 11 pence 25, and Japanese gold at 1 tael 04 points 75, and forward-dated 1 tael 04 points, can all be bought and closed.</p>
<p>▲ Later, It Closed Down to 98 Taels and 6 Mace. The afternoon market opened at 98 taels and 8 mace, followed by 9 taels and 2 mace. Retailers, etc., sold, so it fell to 98 taels and 7 mace. Soon after, Mitsui absorbed spot goods again, priced at 99 taels, which was not far from the expected mark. The exchange market was peaceful, and the banks did near-term US dollars at 47 yuan and 1875 mace and forward-dated at 475 mace. The gold market then raised it by five or six cash, at 9 taels and 3 mace around three o'clock. Afterwards, there seemed to be more suppliers, trimming it by seven or eight cash, at 8 taels and 45 mace at 4:20. By 4:30, it was calculated to close at 98 taels and 6 mace. The trading of British and Japanese exchange rates was sluggish, decreasing by three cash compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>▲ The Quoted Price Still Did Suppressed Ten Taels. The highest price during the day was 500 taels and 0.003 mace, and the lowest price was 498 taels, with a difference of 2 taels and 3 mace. The quoted price has been changed to 508 taels and 8 mace. Because Japanese gold was quoted at a small 0.625, it initially suppressed ten taels. At noon, it was still a small ten taels. In the afternoon, the quoted price still suppressed more than ten taels. The water supplement and registration were all at 99 taels. Early morning goods opened at 9 taels and 8 cash, noon closed at 9 taels and 6 cash, the afternoon opened at 9 taels and 2 cash, and the market closed at 8 taels and a half.</p>
<p>▲ Swap Approaching, Trading Normal. Due to the swap approaching, there were not many interbank trades. It is estimated that Shunli, Yuan Mao Yong, and Taixing, etc., all sold, while Gongyuan Chengyong Yuanda, Yiyu, and Wanxing, etc., all bought. Dadecheng, Zhifeng Yong, Hengxing, Yichang, and Kunhe, etc., had varying entries and exits. Later in the market, all parties became more and more depressed. Yuanda, Zhifeng Yong, and Shunli all entered, while Yiyu, Yufa Yong, Taifengcheng, and Wanxing exited. Generally, there were few entries and exits of hedging orders. The Dalian gang bought about 700 bars in total and sold about 400 bars. It was heard that a certain bank comprador, Mr. Hu, sold more. Generally, the entries and exits of the industry were less than 1,000 bars.</p>
<h3>The Exchange Rate Initially Stabilized Then Weakened</h3>
<p>▲ The Listed Price Lengthened by Half a Notch</p>
<p>▲ The Internal Trading Market Was Desolate</p>
<p>Yesterday's HSBC listed exchange rates. The foreign exchange rate lengthened by half a notch due to the rise in the silver market on Sunday. British exchange increased by 1.25, to 1 shilling and 11 pence 125. US dollars increased by 2.5, to 46 yuan 875. Indian exchange increased by 75, to 129 rupees 25. French francs increased by 6 yuan, to 1,196 yuan. German exchange increased by 1 yuan, to 196 marks. And ocean exchange increased by half a yuan, to 116 guilders 25. Singapore exchange decreased by 75, to 120 taels 25. Japanese exchange decreased by 625, to 1 tael 05 points 375. Hong Kong was still calculated at 80 taels. As for Yokohama, the market rose slightly, and the Kobe market did not change. The local foreign exchange internal market turned from stable and firm to weak, because the gold tender was high and low and buried within 500 taels. Chinese merchants and speculators did not have large supplies of supply, it is estimated that the bank did tens of thousands of pounds between themselves for British exchange, and for US exchange they did tens of thousands of yuan. Chinese merchants only had ten thousands in entries and exits. Only Mitsui had entries and exits. And Japanese exchange had sold one million yuan, and now it was absorbed by Mitsui and Sumitomo, but very few were settled, because the swap was approaching, so there were not many hedging trades. As a result, compared to last weekend, the shilling and the US dollar rose slightly by 0.625, and the Japanese exchange rate fell by 1.25. The market atmosphere was mediocre.</p>
<h3>Long-term Transaction Summary</h3>
<p>The six pairs of long-term deposits and loans opened in September last year will generally expire this month. The details were once described in this newspaper, and most of the long-term settlements that expired on the 10th were also recorded in this newspaper. Today (the 15th), there is another large batch expiring. Furthermore, Ningbo banks have sent personnel to Shanghai to handle the handover and settlement issues. The following is a classified summary of the long-term news from various sources:</p>
<p>▲ Disposition of Expired Funds. Today is another major expiration date. For those that are due for settlement, the audited amount reaches 7 to 8 million. There are no fewer than 100 stores and small banks in Shanghai, each with hundreds of thousands or over a million. According to insiders yesterday, the internal silver root feels constricted due to this, stores with a lot of money are certainly not few but because of preventive plans also do not dare to open fully, and those short of silver are everywhere therefore it is necessary to recover this loan and put it back out, but long term of customer deposit still needs to choose the trustworthy one to pay so the old clients are recovered and released to new clients therefore handover in and out is more frequent this session, and transfers are actually limited, but the small banks, there is a lot of head lining, or there may be a slight overflow, which is also unknown.</p>
<p>▲ Gathering of Ningbo Banks. Most Ningbo banks have plenty of silver. They have always used Shanghai banks to deposit and lend out large amounts, with a total amount of no less than 16 to 17 million per period, mostly expiring at the end of the month. The three periods (15th, 20th, 25th) also have a few. Therefore, the Ningbo banks that are currently transacting are all sending personnel to Shanghai to discuss the matter. It is heard that Ningbo banks want to continue to roll over as usual because Shanghai banks are unwilling to be responsible for lending due to the poor market so it is still questionable whether it will be recovered for now. It must wait until after the 25th before a decision can be made.</p>
<p>▲ Interest Rate of Made Loans. From Friday, Saturday, and yesterday, new transactions of long-term loans and rollover increases were made. The total amount made by various stores and small banks was about 3 million, which was absorbed by Fuxin, Maoxin, Shenxin factories, and tea companies. The stipulated interest rate for the three factories was 9 taels and 2 mace and a half for six pairs. The tea companies were only a few hundred thousand, with interest rates of 8 taels and a half and 8 taels and 2 mace and a half. In addition, various groups in the foreign firm street slightly increased by tens of thousands, with interest rates also between 8 and 9 taels. Therefore, the interest rate for this period is 2 taels and 7 mace and a half cheaper than the previous period.</p>
<p>▲ The Out-of-Town Gangs Are Unable to Repay. The out-of-town gangs that are due to repay long-term loans are unable to do so as scheduled due to poor business and the market being affected by foreign exchange and various other factors, causing a large amount of receivables that have not yet circulated. As a result, they cannot repay the bank loans as scheduled. Subsequently, due to the urgent pressure from creditors, they have had to run aground, with two Sichuan gangs, Haicheng and Qingdao gangs each having contagion, for a total loan debt of no less than 200 thousand.</p>
<h3>Bank Market Extends by Half an Hour</h3>
<p>▲Market Overview　Yesterday, banks operated as usual, and transactions were relatively detailed. The morning market initially showed vigorous trading, and the afternoon market saw particularly active supply and demand, leading to a special half-hour extension of the closing time.

The Shanghai South China Bank was selling, and the Beijing North China General Bank was buying, with a standoff at a price difference of 0.25 taels, causing the delay.</p>
<p>▲Call Loan Rates　(Foreign Call Loan) The morning rate was 7 qian 2 fen 0 hao 3 hu 7 si and a half, similar to the previous day.

<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton: Political Instability the Only Obstacle to Yarn Sales</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weak and trending downward, mainly due to political tensions and sluggish current sales, leading to softening sentiment. Even if prices rise, they lack sustained momentum. However, actual manufacturers remain firm and unwilling to relax their stance, while major sellers also hold out, leading to fierce competition between bulls and bears. Some retail shorts have been adding to their positions in recent months, so the outlook for this month remains highly uncertain.</p>
<p>▲Near-Term Yarn Prices Drop by One or Two Taels. In the morning session, prices for July remained tight, with few sellers. Around 2-3 PM, news of poor yarn sales emerged, with Grade 3 flat and a lack of buyers, leading to a loosening of the market. Prices for various months fell by 2, 3, 5, and 6 qian. The afternoon saw a further weakening of the market and increased selling pressure. Prices for the current month fell by one or two taels, and prices for later months fell by 1, 4, and 5 qian. Trading volume was not strong. Total daily transactions were 13,455 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Variety　Closing Price　Change　Inventory　Closing Price　Change　Inventory</p>
<p>April　151.0　Down 1.2　38,350　July　152.1　Down 9　24,050</p>
<p>May　151.7　Down 1.3　40,650　August　152.57　　19,100</p>
<p>June　152.0　　8　31,300　September　153.25　　6,350</p>
<p>▲Current Yarn Outlets Flat. Total daily purchases by various groups were 880 bales. Purchases by fellow traders were 250 bales. Among the customer groups, Sichuan saw the strongest volume, with 425 bales. In addition, Guangdong purchased 305 bales, the interior 70 bales, Shantou 35 bales, and other miscellaneous groups 55 bales. Market sentiment was flat.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Sees Sharp Decline</h3>
<p>The cotton market has softened, with a significant downward trend. This is mainly due to the cooling of the overseas cotton market, sluggish sales of current cotton in the market, and weak factory demand, leading to slightly fatigued sentiment. Profiteers are liquidating their positions, causing the market to loosen.</p>
<p>▲Futures Cotton Drops by Three Qian. The morning session saw the Hankou futures market open with a subdued mood due to the flatness of the overseas cotton market and a lack of buying interest. As liquidations increased, prices for various months fell sharply by 2.5 to 3.5 qian. In the afternoon, profiteers covered their short positions, leading to a slight recovery. As a result, prices for various months changed by 5 fen to 1 qian. Total daily transactions were 36,900 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hankou Variety　Closing Price　Change　Inventory　 6　2530　Down 30　　74,100</p>
<p>April　3580　Down 15　54,400　July　3525　　35,65,200</p>
<p>May　351　Down 30　79,600　August　3530　　3051,800</p>
<p>Current Cotton Trading Sluggish. With a soft yarn market and weak demand, factories show little interest in buying. Deliveries of incoming Yao cotton were 1,400 bales and Tong cotton 200 bales. Sales prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yao Cotton　32.80　Purchased by customer groups　100 bales　Spot Delivery</p>
<p>Lower Sand Cotton　30.20　Purchased by fellow traders　300 bales　Same</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton　35.50　Purchased by Dong Cotton Firm　800 dan　Delivered Directly to Baling Factory</p>
<h3>British Indian Cotton Industry Weekly Report</h3>
<p>▲Bombay Due to two holidays last week, business was disrupted. On Wednesday, market prices fell slightly due to political instability, but recovered somewhat at closing. Spot demand was moderate, with no interest seen from European and Far Eastern manufacturers. Early arrivals of standard cotton have been absorbed by local factories. Deliveries of White Rashi have reached 24,300 bales, mostly purchased by local merchants. The attached weekly statistics are as follows: (Units: 1,000 bales)</p>
<p>Previous Week　Last Week</p>
<p>Cumulative Receipts Since September 1　2,630　2,706</p>
<p>Current Inventory at Weekend　1,247　1,256</p>
<p>Cumulative Exports Since September 1　1,606　1,679</p>
<p>Shipped to Europe　542　573</p>
<p>Shipped to China　249　260</p>
<p>Shipped to Japan　774　804</p>
<p>Shipped to Other Regions　41　42</p>
<p>▲Liverpool Spot demand was moderate last week, with both futures selling and buying. Market prices were flat. Industry participants are taking a wait-and-see approach pending the results of the US Department of Agriculture's actions. At the same time, the nearing budget period is also a factor hindering business. Egyptian cotton remains quiet. Reports of pests in Egypt have had no impact.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rainy Weather Causes Sluggish Rice Market</h3>
<p>▲Zhabei Yesterday, the arrival of goods from various sources remained quiet, and river inventories remained undiminished. The North Japonica market was increasingly sluggish, with weak top-grade transactions. Medium-grade rice showed slight movement, and prices recovered slightly. There were signs of stabilization at noon. Both arrivals and sales of thin Indica rice were sluggish, and high-grade rice also shifted downstream, with few customers for medium and lower grades. River shipments of sheep Indica rice were particularly scarce, and sales were normal, but the overall market was stable. Sales of Duzi rice at customer ports were still acceptable, but inventories were dwindling, and prices remained unchanged. Sales of common inferior rice were slow and stagnant, and the situation was extremely dull with no change. Overall, rice trading was weak throughout the day, and prices trended flat.</p>
<p>▲South Shanghai River shipments remained scarce, and sales were selectively made to rural villages. After consecutive declines in recent days, sales of Suzhou and Tongxiang Japonica rice showed slight movement, and high prices seemed stable. Lower-grade rice continued to decline. Arrivals and inventories of Changzhou and Wuxi high-grade Japonica rice were low, and merchants were taking a wait-and-see approach due to high prices. The market trend continued to be sluggish, and the price level remained unchanged. Customer groups showed some interest in Southern thin Indica and early Indica rice, but they were very picky, and market prices were only slightly lower in wholesale. Sales of sheep Duzi rice were flat. Recently, most shops selling imported rice have adequately stocked their inventories, and prices are stable. Sales of white rice were unsatisfactory, but distilleries slightly increased purchases of top-grade inferior rice, although market prices remained average.</p>
<h3>Futures Low-Grade Rice Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's imported rice market continued to show a favorable trend with customer groups paying close attention. However, spot rice transactions were limited due to incoming shipments, and prices only rose by a few cents. 2,000 bags of Saigon No. 2 were offered at 14.91 yuan, 2,000 bags of low-grade rice were offered at 14.68 yuan, 2,000 bags of Min Dang rice were offered at 14.78 yuan, and 600 bags of brown rice were offered at 14.29 yuan. Saigon No. 1 had high inventories and slow sales, with 1,000 bags offered at 15.45 yuan, and medium and lower grades were discounted.</p>
<p>Imported rice futures markets were bullish, and sellers were reluctant to offer much. Domestic appetite was strong, and returning shipments became increasingly firm. Low-grade rice continued to rise, with prices of two to eight cents per bag, with only 1,500 tons offered.</p>
<h3>Rainy Weather Boosts Flour Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning's flour market saw April and May prices open lower due to reports of low overseas wheat prices (0.5-0.7 yuan), causing temporary weakness in sentiment. However, new crop prices for later months were not affected by the reports of low overseas wheat prices, maintaining their high interest. Due to the heavy rain the previous night and the clear weather yesterday, sentiment both inside and outside the market was greatly stimulated, and buying interest was strong. Many were concerned that abundant harvests would not materialize, and the current weather conditions confirmed their fears. The buying interest increased further in the afternoon, and trading was particularly active. Some Suzhou and most Jiangsu groups were covering their short positions, causing market prices to rise. The market shift due to weather conditions is a common occurrence, but this year's sentiment is even more intense. Near-term contracts remain stable due to unchanged actual sales. As a result, the current month is up 0.025 yuan compared to the previous day, May is up 0.01 yuan, June and July are up 0.0175 yuan, and August and September are expected to rise by 0.02 yuan.</p>
<h3>Distant New Wheat Surges 0.08 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, futures wheat and flour sales were poor, and current inventories were high, with little enthusiasm. Distant new wheat, however, saw unusual excitement due to continuous spring rain and cold weather, especially for June contracts. Due to excessive spring rain, the abundance of the harvest cannot be predicted, but delays are expected, leading to increased market focus. Nanjing and Jiangsu groups were selling heavily, leading to heavy short covering and rising market prices. As a result, the current month closed 0.01 yuan lower than the previous week, June rose a massive 0.08 yuan, July rose 0.03 yuan, August rose 0.04 yuan, and September rose 0.03 yuan. Current wheat transactions were weak, and prices were stable. High-quality goods seemed slightly lower than the previous week due to the firm stance of factories. Five taels and 0.16 yuan was offered for Southern Suzhou wheat, 5.16 yuan for Qingjiangpu wheat, 5.16 yuan for Bengbu and Xuzhou wheat, and 5.01 to 5.03 yuan for Mingguang wheat. A total of 14,000 bags were handled by Fuxin.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Spring Rain Causes Quiet Piece Goods Sales</h3>
<p>▲Local Cotton Cloth: Rainy weather means no customers. Wholesale is slow. Coarse cloth remains unchanged. Over a hundred pieces of 11-pound cloth were traded in Ningbo, Hangzhou and other ports, with Three Rabbits being the strongest, opening at 4.65 taels. Three Cats and Three Deer at 4.6 taels have already been sold. Heavy cloth is slightly softer due to lack of movement in the northern market. However, 17-pound Five Bats is particularly strong due to low inventory. Coarse twill is increasingly dull. Medium blue fine twill double fish at 0.025, opening at 6.5 taels, Yang Crane spot goods are still short. The rising trend of fine cloth is not yet over. Over 150 pieces were purchased by Wenzhou, Taizhou and other groups yesterday.</p>
<p>▲Eastern and Western Piece Goods: Continuous spring rain has led to a weakening market. Sluggish actual sales are rare in recent years. Customer groups show no interest in replenishment, and replenishment in the local market is limited. Eastern goods have already begun to decline. Raw Western Yarn has fallen by 0.025 yuan. Dian Qiuxiang opened at 8.425 taels, Tang Taizong at 8.25 taels, Zijinshan at 8 taels. It is observed that an increasing number of 84 cloth is being redyed, making it difficult to maintain stability. Medium Mokanshan, Hunter Goose Muqiu of upright tribute Nima has returned to 0.2625 yuan. However, Double Child Deer is at 0.235 yuan because of its low stock. Recently, white straight-stripe hemp yarn and blue straight-stripe hemp yarn of Western goods have fallen consistently. However, fifty pieces of bleached cloth have been purchased by northern groups. Gongping chased Qiuxiang to 8.85 taels, and Flying Kite to 8.4 taels.</p>
<h3>Silk &amp; Tea: Chinese Silk Shipments to the US Surge</h3>
<p>▲Over 80,000 Bales Shipped Since Last Summer, Up Over 30,000 Bales. Our country's silk has always been a major export commodity. Each year, 80,000-90,000 bales are shipped from Shanghai, mostly to the Americas. In recent years, the sales of silk fabrics in the United States have been increasing daily, and the consumption of raw silk has been growing. Last autumn, due to the lifting of the gold embargo in Japan, the gold market soared and silver prices were extremely low. American silk merchants abandoned Japanese silk for Chinese silk (silk trade with Japan uses gold, while with China uses silver, making Chinese silk cheaper). Chinese silk exports to the US surged. Since the new silk market opened last summer, shipments of Chinese silk from the Shanghai Customs to the United States have totaled 89,765 bales, a massive increase of 34,688 bales compared to the same period last year.</p>
<h3>British and French Follow Suit to Purchase Futures Silk</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign silk market in Shanghai continued to show prosperity. Since the US firms heavily replenished their stock last week due to shortages, silk inventories in the market are even lower. British and French firms followed suit to purchase, and Indian firms also traded yellow and white coarse silk. Market sentiment was firm and prosperous. Yesterday, Xinfu and others imported 50 bales of Shanghai White Factory silk, Zhonghe and others imported 20 bales of White Qian silk, and Kechang and others imported 19 bales of yellow coarse silk. Prices are increasingly firm.</p>
