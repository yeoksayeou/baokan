<p>國之自由平等、國民革命軍、即遵從總理遺敎、繼承總理遺志、以求中國之自由平等爲已任者也、自帝國主義者肆行侵略、利用軍閥、爲其虎倀、致中國陷於半殖民地之地位、人民瀕於經濟破產之絕境、第一次全國代表大會宣言、曾評騭當時各黨派各個人所擬議之救國方案、斷言其無一是處、祇有以國民革命實行三民主義、爲中國惟一生路、但此實行國民革命、掃盪國内一切軍閥、抵禦帝國主義者之武力壓迫、非有眞正能爲國民革命效死之軍人不可、故總理晚年、注全力於培養革命軍人、軍人精神敎育等篇、其所以朂勉革命軍人者甚至、總理逝世以後、本黨同志創立國民革命軍、以其適合於國家之需要、人民之願望、而我革命先烈復前仆後繼、犠牲其寳貴之生命、捍衛黨國、用能於最短之期間、完成全國統一之業、我國民革命軍之意義、至爲重大、國民革命軍之歷史、至爲光榮、旣非任何人所</p>
<p>能私有、并非任何人所能破壞、且中國之自由平等、今猶未能達到、稍有人心者、皆不忍妨碍國民革命之進展、况以救國救民自任之革命軍人、决無自外生存别趨歧路之理、亦萬不能坐視國民革命軍人之被人毁棄、不思拯救也、閻錫山·馮玉祥本爲軍閥餘孽、其加入國民革命軍、並非出於誠意、僅爲投機取巧之慣技、數</p>
<p>早爲國人所共見、然其誣蔑中央、詆毁中正、猶假革命之名義以行之、今則圖窮匕*</p>
<p>見、已完全背叛國民革命、並國民革命軍之名稱、而亦毁棄之矣、閻錫山馮玉祥集合利害極不一致之各派反動分子、其所標榜、往往自相矛盾、並無一定之救國方案、幾使人莫測其用意所在、天奪其魄、乃自揭破其假革命之面具、明白告人、彼等已反對國民革命、不願見中國之自由平等、彼等已反對國民革命軍、不惜與全體革命軍人挑戰、彼等已公然放棄國民革命軍生大之使命、忍陷全國同胞於萬刦不復之境、假革命者、暴露其眞面目、而自促其滅亡、在革命過程中、實爲可幸之事、閻錫山馮玉祥之離棄國民革命軍、正國民革命軍之大幸、然國民革命軍將士若不努力殺賊、而使其多存在一日、即國民革命軍多一日恥辱、國民革命之成功多一日障碍、此决非我革命軍人所能忍受者也、閻錫山·馮玉祥、欲保持其封建勢力、而與國民革命爲仇、此實全國國民之罪人、凡願致力國民革命者咸當奮起聲討、但我國民革命軍全體將士、尤當顧名思義、如何而能繼承總理之遺志、如何而能完成革命之責任、如何而能保持歷史之光榮、如何而能解除自身之痛</p>
<p>苦、皆非以全力與封建勢力决戰不可、國民革命軍與閻錫山馮玉祥不兩立、閻馮存則國民革命軍亡、中國亦不可救、我將士必當有爲國犠牲之最大决心、誓以全力消滅此國民革命軍之公敵、總理曾云、革命軍必須以一當百與國賊奮鬥、又云、革命軍應以先烈爲標準、舍身成仁、犠牲一切權利、專心救國、諸將士旣知國賊所在、自必忠勇奮發、誓死奮鬥、爲我軍爭歷史上之光榮、即爲中國求自由平等之實現、總理與已死各將士在天之靈、實式憑之、（七日專電）</p>

<h3 id="c13">印度甘地之非武力抵抗 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>印度甘地之非武力抵抗。破壞鹽法。已在著著進行。無論日後成功與否。而其不爲一已之私。不犠牲他人而身自作則。畏艱難。不避危險。其舉動之純潔而眞摯。誠爲世界所共見而共聞。旣非圖私利。亦非私報私恨。禍則先於一已。利則及於全民。是誠難能而可貴也。</p>
<p>人能預備虧本以貿利。人能預備犠牲已之生命以與人决鬥。人能預備舍棄一已之所有。以與人交戰。其主義示必盡是。而其眞誠之意。則已人所能知。其非圖徼倖。其非投機。其非於中取利。固皎然在人耳也。苟非深知不可不如此。被迫至不得不如此。則决不出此。</p>
<p>於已無所損失之善事。人人得而爲之。於已無所損失。且更有所利益善事。人人又何樂而不爲之。然而世間之善事。决不能若是易爲也。况欲與公衆之人。爭一權復一利。又在於强力迫壓之下。費小犠牲以求大收獲。尙且不可。况以徼倖投機於中取利之方法行之乎。故觀於甘地之非武力抵抗之行動。身任艱難而一無取巧與圖利。可以風示爲公衆而奮鬥者矣。</p>

<p>電通社七日東京電　軍令部以照此次協定、三國條約之兵力、到底不能完全維持國防、擬草就新擴張策、海軍省則參考軍令部之計畫、爲塡補潛水艦之兵力不足起見、擬將航空兵力、大加擴張、繼續五年、要求建造費一億五千萬元、至十一年度止之維持費一億元、合計二億五千萬元、又爲補償未能貫澈大型巡洋艦之七成要求起見、擬要求特别經費、如改装費修理費演習費燃料費等、俟全般協定成立後、即提出具體案、</p>

<p>叛變時、閻表面助馮、實際上則帮助中央、以促其失敗、彼竟乘機收編其退却之軍隊、以擴充自已實力、嗣又騙馮作第二次叛變、中央軍打到潼關時、彼又要利用機會、消滅西北軍殘部、同時將馮玉祥實行禁錮於山西、此種陰謀、西北軍多恨之刺骨、此次又縱馮入陜、助馮作亂、馮部並非認爲閻之企圖竟可成功、不過藉此索供餉械、騙得多少是多少、若言眞正聯合、任何人不能相信、至利用改組派搗亂方法、彼雖以爲得計、但陳公博本屬投機分子、惟利是圖、先後爲共產黨汪精衛李宗仁唐生智之貓脚爪、結果皆不遇騙取金錢、此次又萌故智、但閻老姦巨猾、是否受彼之騙、殊未可必、現在討伐令旣下、軍事日趨緊張、以中央力量、及體諸已往平亂事實、相信定能將一切反革命派迅速消滅、一鼓蕩平、惟一方以武力裁制旣成之叛亂、一方仍應以精誠感化、消弭未來之叛亂、更應以和平建設方法、以鞏固黨國之基礎、至一般反革命派所以敢更迭叛亂之原因、（一）由全國人民未能共同負起國民責任、以眞正眼光和偉大力量、以明順逆辨是非、使其有所顧忌、而不敢甘冒不韙、（二）爲國内輿論對於一切反動派、尙未能盡量裁制、加以痛切之批評、致一般民衆猶不識順逆是非之所在、對國家觀念因而薄弱、今後希望全黨同志努力負責宣傳、使反動派於旣仆之後永不再起云云、報告畢、十時半散會、</p>
<p>國民政府　同日上午十時、國民政府舉行總理紀念週、到蔣中正·譚延闓·王寵惠·古應芬·宋子文·朱培德·陳紹寬·賀耀組·金漢鼎·易培基·劉瑞恒·張難先·楊杰等、及國府文官參軍兩處職員、共三百餘人、蔣中正主席、行禮後、蔣作報告如下、</p>
<p>「各位同志、在上星期四月一日、閻錫山已就中」</p>
<p>華民國陸海空軍總司令僞職、馮玉祥李宗仁也跟着就副司令僞職、此事已於各報揭載、各位必已知道了、這件事看來雖似重大、但是我們就革盒命立塲上看來、并不算一回事、國民革命的名稱、他們丨閻錫山丨本是很怕的、革命二字不但是軍閥懼怕、就是帝國主義者也很駭怕的、因此我們就被許多人所嫉視、自從廣東出發後、我們革命軍百戰百勝、他們看了没有辦法、不能不加八革命、而我們因環境關係、也就任他混在裏面、到現在他們軍閥的本來面目、也不能再行掩飾、一天一天的暴露出來了、他們是不要國民、不要革命、直截了當做軍閥行爲、給人民看了、我們知道以後一方面是國民革命軍、一方面是軍閥的軍隊、我們看到底那一個勝利、閻錫山自就僞職以後、他對於革命對於國民的信用、已完全失掉了、再不能混入革命陣線做他們賣國的勾當了、至於討伐閻逆的問題、現在各黨部和一般民衆皆主張對閻錫山加以討伐、但是在政府同人的意思、是用不着以軍隊去討伐、現在閻錫山反革命的行爲雖已暴露、但是他的弱點還未十分明顯、他們這次的叛變、在他們看以爲似很大的事、但是我們可以把他當作一件很小的事看、甚至於當作没有這一回事亦可的、我相信在最近之將來、他們自已内部要討伐自已的、不單是他們所認爲友軍的要自相衝突、就是他們的部下恐怕也要討伐他們了、所以政府暫時無須用兵、本席兩三天後或者到津浦平漢兩路去視察、但是並不是指揮軍隊去討伐他們、現在我們最要緊的、就是内部的整頓、無論在軍事上政治上黨務上、皆要自已努力、果能這樣、就是不用兵、反動派自然而然會消滅的、如果我們不自努力、就是没有反動派、也是會消滅的、所以現在無論社會上政治上經濟上各項事體應該努力整頓、本席這次在浙江看到我們從前所有的毛病、爲一般人所不满意、及反動派怕嫉忌的、尙未能改去、還有許多靑年、他們不知道怎樣才能達到革命的目的、對於政府責望亦太過、政府决不能將革命的事業一天功夫完全辦好、又本席聽說鄉間黨部不許人民去上墳、不許燒紙灰、這不許燒紙灰、是應當的、誰也不會去獎勵燒紙灰的、但是他們應該知道、現在做紙灰營業的人、統計是在五十萬以上、如果禁燒紙灰、社會上至少要有五十萬人因此失業、政府下一個命令、是很容易、但是在没有想好救濟方法以前、弄到許多人失業、政府是否能負這種責任呢、否則豈不是徒令社會上不安嗎、所以一般靑年類多不明、此不過舉其一端而言、其餘亦多如此、還有掃墓一事、乃我國幾千年來的習慣、政府當然無禁止之令、而下級黨部不明、以致弄到社會上發生誤會、</p>
<p>有前天和記洋行發生工潮、隨有學生游行、此事敎育界同政府要負責任的、現在反動派造謠、竟說英人打死和記工友四人、這是完全没有的事、要知道在革命政府之下、我們的國民是不會無故給外國人打死的、市政府敎育部應告知各學校校長、如果學生輕聽謠言、爲反動派來做工具、有越軌舉動、政府要當他反革命一樣來處置的、要知道從前在北京反革命政府時代、靑年爲革命而　　　感、是可以的、現在革命政府之下、　　羽反動的行爲、那就是自絕於革命、不但　　　　而且負了反革命的名號、是决没有　　的　　、</p>
<p>所以現在如果那一個學校或是那一個團體、不聴政府命令、無故掀動風潮、政府必要嚴加制裁的、現在反動派一天一天的起來、正是我們努力奮鬥的時候、從前總理在廣東很小的地方、尙能鞏固革命基礎、發展革命勢力、現在地方比前大得多了、無論經濟上的力量、軍事上的力量、皆勝過從前、任何反動派皆可掃除、很望大家繼續總理革合精神、鞏固革命基礎、使總理幾十年革命的事業、不要被人消滅、祗要我們本身健全、内部鞏固、没有人能做我們敵人的、敵人愈多、我們革命前途愈光明、愈有希望、我們祗要整頓内部、一致努力建設、反動軍閥用不着軍隊來討伐、就要消滅的、本席一兩天内又要出去、望各位注意整頓内部、尤其是首都各機關要振作精神、我們用不着軍隊去討伐叛逆、來犠牲將士的性命、人民的財產、我們很相信不久就可將反動派悉數消滅、國家得到眞正的統一、這是本席今天貢獻於大家的」、</p>

<p>（一）上海勝廣東之戰</p>
<p>上海與廣東兩足球隊球藝、久貫入耳、昨日値大會複賽之期、二隊接戰於足球塲、慕名作壁上觀、者、竟達四五千之衆、看台上擠得水洩不通、大有入满之患、兩隊鏖戰九十分鐘、起初廣東隊尙能維持、愈戰愈形不支、結果上海隧以五對○之紀錄、大敗廣東隊、獲大大足球决賽權、觀衆莫不同聲贊許也、</p>

<p>斯日天朗氣淸、二時許半觀衆更高紛至沓來、足球塲外、途爲之塞、售票處手先恐後、擁擠不堪、入塲口躋躋蹌蹌、勢如潮湧、尤以靑年學子爲多、咸有鼓舞欣歡之意、蓋欲一觀兩隊健兒、大顯好身手也、</p>
<p>鐘鳴三下、兩隊隊員、先後魚貫入塲、稍練脚頭、即列陣對抗、上海據北、廣東佔南、雙方動作迅、速、表演精良、衝鋒陷陣、勢如破竹、傳遞之美妙、使觀衆讚賞不止、其初實力難分軒輊、形勢至見平均、廣東前鋒至勇、但射門功夫太弱、每難建功、上海固强、惟其取得勝利、亦已　盡心計矣、</p>
<p>雙方戰來、十分劇烈、時而上海隊進攻、而廣東隊反襲你來我往、幾無時無刻不在驚濤駭浪中上海隊、以平均見常、健將李惠堂陳鎭和雖未出塲、實力並不减少、廣東隊以陳光耀表示最佳、内衛亦可、惟舉動慌張、時有失足之憂耳、</p>

<p>賽後不數分鐘、粵陳光耀、向滬隊猛迫過來、江善敬還擊不遠、此時滬隊球門空虚、李寗至此、奮不顧身、臥地踼出、博得掌聲不少、</p>
<h3 id="c85">驚風駭浪 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>粵前鋒奔跑迅速、觀者有目共當、十分鐘時、陳光耀斬關直入、至綫底傳中、四前鋒直馳撲過來、滬隊門前、頓呈不安之象、幸屬賢言李寗挽救有方、未遭暗算、</p>
<h3 id="c86">内衛森嚴 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>滬隊進攻不得、乃變更方略、用五路包抄法進攻、無奈粵隊内衛森嚴、實難飛越、滬隊進攻愈烈、粵隊戒備愈嚴、此時滬隊亦惟有徒呼負負耳、</p>

<h3 id="c88">兵貴神速 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>

<h3 id="c90">觀衆叫絕 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>混戰聲中、戴得球傳與陳家球、陳還交與戴、戴再傳與陳不虞添、陳截住盤上、衝過一關、飛步進發、如入無人之境、同時拳聲四起、虞添愈加出神、衝至門邊、一脚踼中、頗有力道、</p>

<p>南京勝實力之强、作戰之勇、俱出遼寗隊之上、</p>
<p>其獲勝較易、遼寗隊抵禦尙力、惟前鋒有數次機、會極佳、而不能中的、所謂不幸、其左翼何榮章及劉寳君二人、常能深入敵境、造成恐慌局面、惟因對方内衛遠强、卒難奏功、</p>
<h3 id="c93">一敼作氣 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>一時起擇方交戰、遼寗隊一鼓作氣、大舉侵襲、開賽未幾、即見南京隊右翼江之鴻衝入重圍、聲勢洶洶、但爲遼寗隊後衛所阻、卒不得逞、賽至約一刻鐘後突見遼寗中堅得球挑過後衛、傳與吳融和、吳奪路强衝而進、蔡思成掩護於旁、雙雙並進、當者非易、至球之近處、吳融和脚頭一起、球由左角入網、乃開紀錄、此後遼寗隊愈戰愈勇、前鋒衝擊數次、表演甚佳、南京隊安肯示弱、反襲甚力數次傳遞、卒被右内鋒凌遠揚射進一球打平手、遼寗隊有一次最險者、厥爲南京隊乘遼寗隊傾全力進攻之際、右翼江之鴻有一絕妙之傳遞、中鋒顧元亮在距門六七碼處、得一從容射門之機會、惜球出過偏、否則遼寗隊必無幸矣、三十分鐘時、遼寗又告奮勇、右内鋒得球猛力向門射來、球撞橫木而回、此球雖未命中、然守門員已飽受虚驚矣、混戰移時、遼寗蔡思成突圍再攻亦未奏效、此後變方攻守漸均、勢甚平衡、上半時結果爲一對一、成和局、</p>
<h3 id="c94">再而衰 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>上半塲易地再戰、南京隊頗得勢、遼寗内衛、大告奮勇、力施劇衝、使對方不能有舉足射門之機會、入後遼寗大告奮勇、力攻之餘、曾迫待兩次角球機會、但無效果、事有出人意料者、南京隊正在努力抵抗之時、不意一個遠傳遞竟致遼寗隊之死命、由左翼劉祖侃射進一球、嗣後遼寗亦射進一球、惟以越位作廢、</p>
<h3 id="c95">三而竭 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>二十分鐘後南京左翼得凌揚之助、又射進一球、已而遼寗亦由中鋒彈進一球、入後南京多取守勢、相機進攻、直至終結、兩無所獲、結果南京以三對二勝、</p>
<h3 id="c96">比賽餘波 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>遼寗鑒於比賽之失敗、選手多人、蜂湧入場、聲勢洶洶、要打公正人、幸經多人勸解、始得了事、查此種舉動、該隧選手、在此次大會中、已成司空見慣、實爲大會之遺憾、亦爲該隊之污點、深望該隊領導在平常訓練時校正之、</p>

<p>次賽結果</p>
<p>上海勝遼寗···五三對四四</p>
<p>香港勝神户···五七對四三</p>
<p>上海與遼寗之戰</p>
<p>兩隊實力無分上下</p>
<p>但滬擲球較有把握</p>
<p>昨日下午一時、男子上海隊與遼寗隊舉行次賽、上海籃球久負盛各、遼寗則以馮庸大學爲基本、多數爲天津扶輪舊球員、如咸壯懷武繼淸馬毓、華等、均係天津能手、故實力亦殊可觀、上半時滬隊佔優勢、分數爲三十四對十五、上海勝、下半時遼寗隊個個拚命、變更戰術、結果二十九對十九、遼寗勝、總結果五十三對四十四、上海得勝、獲得今日之複賽權、茲將比賽情形、分誌於下、</p>
<h3 id="c99">一帆風順 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>上半時比賽開始、雙方接戰極爲激烈、三分鐘内並無紀錄、第四分鐘時、上海梁國權首開紀錄、首射中一球、未幾遼寗内衛馬毓華亦擲中一球、成二對二、越一分鐘黃運利汪今鵬互得一球成八對二之比、遼隊見上海勢利不可當、即宣告休息、並以蔴秉鈞易武繼淸爲中鋒、但茲後上海一帆風順、分數繼長增高、遼隊擲籃、似欠準確、雖合作功夫甚佳、卒以失去機會過多、無濟於事上半時遂成三十四對十五之比、</p>

<p>銀笛聲中、下半時開始作戰、滬隊以魏海靑易何通爲中鋒、遼寗全隊抱背城借一决心、奮鬥十分激烈、且變更戰略、遠交近攻、無往不利、最初之十分鐘間、竟造成十五對五之紀錄、時總分爲三十九對三十、滬勝、相差僅九分、於是上海宣告休息、何通二次進場、滬隊如恢復從前勇氣、何通亦連續擲中數球、最後終成下半時二十九對十九之比、遼寗勝、總分五十三對四十四、上海勝、論兩隊實力、殊不相上下、但滬除擲球較有反握耳、</p>

<p>昨日複賽結果滬粵得决賽權</p>
<p>錦標誰屬明日分曉</p>
<p>廣東勝平甲···二比○</p>
<p>粵隊攻守得宜</p>
<p>平隊缺少聯絡</p>
<p>廣東與北平甲二隊、自四日先後戰勝滬乙及遼寗以後、各獲得複賽資格、七日下午一時、二隊相競於排球塲中、廣東隊員人才平均、前中後三排、聯絡甚佳、北平陣缐、亦頗不弱、惜以經騐較淺、初陣甚爲散亂、第二局中、頗有驚人之表演、並不因敗而氣綏、其精神亦良可佩也、比賽略情誌後、</p>
<p>一時開賽、南北女將、欵段入塲、雙方隊員精神飽满、服装整齊、尤以粵隊之白衫裋褲、一律光腿、頗有男童化、而體態之活潑、姿勢之玲瓏、一望而知爲善戰之材、戰幕方啟、二隊奮力進攻、北平陣局散漫、失着甚多、粵則一路順風、連續得有十四分之多、因此北平軍心、更見慌亂、雖一再努力競爭、然終以分數相差太多、勢難追達、惟局勢漸漸相平、各有進展、未幾粵以二十一比六勝、</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>第二局起、北平志在反攻、團結力非常堅固、前排攻勢、頗形得手、分數始終相近、粵隊雖先以十一比九佔先、而此後北平更見努力、酣戰良久、分數突增至十七比十四、轉敗爲勝、粵見敵勢盛熾、亦相約合力應付、攻守方法、均甚得當、是時表演非常精彩、爲前此數幕中所突見、每球之勝負、恒有十次八次之回合、遮欄壓擊、各顯其能、祗見網之上端、織手伸排、球則滾來滾去、煞爲美觀、有時球雖被擊出塲、仍能利用遠傳方法以脫險、觀衆掌聲齊嗚、歡呼雷動、瞬息之間、北平仍以十八比十四領先、嗣粵隊發球得手、竟成十九對十九之局、繼又各爲二十、在此勝負關頭緊要時期、雙方爭競更烈、蓋時機之迫、間不容髮、稍縱即逝、終以粵發球得手佔先、兩次增得二分獲勝、連勝兩局、而取得决賽權、</p>
<p>觀是日比賽、以二隊人才而論、廣東較爲平均、北平好手固多、但有一二人技能稍差、以致聯絡方面、不能隨心應手、中排彭靜波、失着最多、在第二局中、此君如能努力向前、定可早佔勝利、則第三局中之鹿死誰手、正未敢預定也、由此可知球隊之優良、固不在有少數特殊之人才、而實有賴於聯絡之功用也、裁判員許民輝、兩隊陣綫、列左、</p>

<p>甲、怎樣使全國學齡兒童一律入學、要實施四年的義務敎育、依人口十分之一的比例計算、全國應有學齡兒童四千三百萬人、（註公）除去現在已經入學的學童不計外、（註七）還有三千七百萬人没有受敎育的機會、加以二十年裏、人口自然增加、學齡兒童至少、也要增加三百萬人、合計起來共有四千萬人、這四千萬學齡兒童、按照市鄉人口分配、城市約占百分之十五、鄉間約占百分之八十五、當前第一問題、就是怎樣使這四千萬兒童全體入學、</p>
<p>乙、所需敎師怎樣養成、假定每一敎師平均擔任顉育學生四十人、（註八）那末全國須増加敎師一百萬人、然而敎師不能人人在小學裏終身服務、假定每五年更換五分之一、那末二十年裏要換去敎師十分之八、在初開辦時、敎師人數太少、不能不延長服務年限、假定更換的數目减少一半、那末一百萬敎師中、二十年裏要換去四十萬人、所以二十年裏必須造成敎師一百四十萬人、才能够用、目前亟須解决的第二問題、就是怎樣在二十年裏養民敎師一百四十萬人、</p>
<p>丙、所需校舍及敎室中的設備怎模增置、假定每一敎室容約四十人、（註九）那末全國須增敎室一百萬間、添置敎室設備一百萬套、有人建議學校挅採用葛雷制（Gray　System）每敎室容納學生兩班、那末敎室可以减少、但實際上、葛雷制只能在工商發達、人口集中的都市裏辦、若在人烟寥落、交通不便的鄉村裏用葛雷制、反而便每班學生人數減少、不但不能節省敎室、並且要增加敎員、反不經濟、城市裏學童人數、僅占全體百分之十五、假使城市裏小學校一律採用葛雷制、也不過能减少敎室百分之七左右、但是葛雷制實行以後、學校敎室、不能再用來開辦成年、補習敎育、列難作社會改革的中心、（Ｓｏｃｉａｌ）Ｃｅｎｔｅｒ）故省了百分之七的敎室、實在得不償失、因此、本計畫仍擬增加敎室一百萬間、但怎樣籌集鉅欵、建築這多數的敎室、並且添置敎室裏必需的設備、實在是目前急須解答的第三問題、</p>
<p>丁、所需經費怎樣籌措、每一兒童入學、公家</p>
<p>至少每年擔任經費七元、（註十）要使四千萬兒童入學、每年須增經費二億八千萬元、建築敎室、培養師資所需的錢在外、（註十一）這大宗的經費、怎樣籌措、中央與地方對於義務敎育經費的担負怎樣分配、都是目前應行解答的最重要的問題、</p>
<p>（四）培養師資及使分期入學辦法</p>
<p>第一　實施義務敎育、所需培養的一百四十萬敎師裏、有百分之十五在城市小學服務、約須二十萬人左右、可以由都市裏現有的師範學校及高中師範科負責訓練、其餘百分之八十五須在鄉村小學服務、約計一百二十萬人左右、應由各縣設立鄉村師範負責訓練、</p>
<p>第二、都市師範學校的師資、由現有師範大學或各大學敎育學校、及大學内與訓練師資有關係的學院及專修科負責訓練、</p>
<p>第三、縣立鄉村師範學校的師資、由省立鄉村師範學院及鄉村師範專修科、（以下略稱專修科）</p>
<p>負責訓練、</p>
<p>第四、省立鄉村師範學院及專修科的師資、由國立義務敎育學院負責培養、</p>
<p>北平男籃球隊　　王開攝</p>
<p>第五　縣立鄉村師範學校大縣單獨設立、上縣聯合設立、全國共設一千五百所、在五年裏完全成立、所需鄉村小學師資一百二十萬人、由這一千五百所師範學校分頭訓練、平均每所必須養成敎師八百人、自第六年起、每校每年平均應有畢業生五十三人、這種師範學校招收高小畢業生、訓練三年、（這是最低限度參看第十一條）三年裏中途退學的必多、大約須有學生一百二十人才產生畢業生五十三人、充當鄉小敎師、目前過渡辦法、應招收私塾敎師、加以訓練、以應念需、每年平均須有二百人、由縣立鄉村師範學校負責訓練、</p>
<p>第六、每一縣立鄉村師範、平時訓練學生一百二十人、至少須有敎師十人、一千五百所師範學校共須敎師一萬五千人、這一萬五千人裏、每五年更换五分之一、計十五年裏須更換十分之六、但最初設校不多、更換的敎員也可减少、故十五年裏實際約須換去敎員十分之四、爲補充這更換的敎員計、須加造師資六千人、兩共須有三二萬一千人、才能使各縣立師範的師資、不致感覺缺乏、</p>
<p>第七、培養這二萬一千人、須在各省特設鄉村師範學校及專修科二十七所、每所平均必須培養七百七十七人、内中有一萬五千人須於第四年年底以前培養成功、以便各省縣立師範能在第五年并始的時候、完全成立、從第二年起到第四年止、每年須培養五千人、二十七省、每省每年平均須養成一百八十人、三年共五百四十人、　　第八、省立鄉村師範學院及專修科所需的敎師五百四十人、由國立義務敎育學院、分兩年養成每年培養二百七十人、以後每年須繼續培養一百人以補缺額、並提高程度、</p>
<p>第九、國立義務敎育學院及實騐區、在第一年就開始設立、先收大學畢業生、訓練一年、分發各省充當鄉村師範學院及鄉村師範專修科敎師、也得充當各省義務敎育行政人員、中央義務敎育實騐區應分兩處、一在城市、一在鄉間、供該院學生實地試騐、並作推行全國義務敎育的基礎、</p>
<p>、第十　各省特設的鄉村師範學院及鄉村師範專修科、並省立義敎實騐區、應在第二年開始時開辦、該學院招收大學二年級已經修了的學生使受兩期的訓練、第一期在校求學一年、即派赴各鄉村師範學校充當敎員、服務二年以後、再回校肄業一年、授予學士學位、准充當鄉師校長敎員及敎育行政人員、</p>
<p>鄉村師範專修科設在省立鄉村師範學院裏、招收高中畢業生、訓練一年、給予修業證書、派充各中心小學敎職員、各鄉敎員委員、或鄉村師範助敎、以後每年暑假必須入學研究、修满三個暑假後、即可授予鄉村師範專修科畢業文憑、各省義務敎育實騐區亦應分城市及鄉村兩處供學生實習、並作推行全省義務敎育的基礎、　　第十一　縣或縣聯合設立的鄉村師範學校、分三期開辦、從第三年、第四年、第五年起、分别成立三分之一、總計從第三年起到第五年止、全國每年添設縣立師範學校五百所、城市及鄉村義務敎育實騐區各五百處、</p>
<p>縣立鄉村師範、招收初中畢業生、修學二年、派充鄉村小學敎員、以後每年暑假必須入學修满三個署假後、給予　鄉師畢業文憑、准其充當中心學校正敎員、及各鄉敎育行政人員、</p>
<p>鄉村師範亦得招收高小畢業生、而年齡在十五歲以上者、修學三年後、派赴各鄉村小學充當助敎、服務兩年並修满兩個暑期學校後、再回校修學一年、然後重出服務、充當鄉小敎師、再過二年、並修學兩個暑假、得授予正式師範學校或高中師範科畢業文憑、及中心小學敎師執照、</p>
<p>第十二　到第五年年底義務敎育師資培養機關及各省市鄉義敎實騐區普遍設立、從第六年起、合現有省立師範學校及新設縣立鄉村師範學校、每年造就師資九萬人、其中減去退職敎師一萬五千人、每年凈增敎師七萬五千人、這樣可以增設小學七萬五千班敎育兒童三百萬人、到第十八年全國小學已可普遍設立、到第二十年、全國可以完全實施四年的義務敎育了、</p>
<p>在開辦各級師資訓練機關以外、更須舉辦下列各事、</p>
<p>甲　登記全省各師範學校及各師範講習所畢業生、勸令分赴各小學服務、凡未有工作的師範畢業生、一律由敎育廳分發各縣、充當小學敎員、　　乙、厲行師範畢業生服務規程、凡曾受師範敎育者、必須在小學校服務三年到五年、</p>
<p>丙、凡非正式師範學校畢業的敎員、一律重加檢定、揀選學識經騐合格的、分别聘用以補師資的不足、並規定敎員暑假進修辦法、切實執行、使他們的學識隨時進步、</p>
<p>丁、凡檢定不合格的小學敎員、分别送入縣立鄉村師範學校、使受一年或二年的訓練、</p>
<p>戍、考試私塾塾師、凡及格的暫充鄉村小學敎師、並使在暑假中補受師範敎育、考試不及格的私塾塾師、勸令人縣立鄉村師範學校、受二年以上的訓練、</p>
<p>（五）增加敎室的辦法、</p>
<p>實施義務敎育、全國須增敎室一百萬間、全國一</p>
<p>千九百十五縣、平均每縣須增敎室五百餘間、目前財政困難、地方上恐無力特建、所以不得不採用下列各種辦法、</p>
<p>甲、利用全國人民家廟、中國人富於家族觀念第一家族常有一家廟、（或稱祠堂）公家可借用家廟裏的一部份、開辦小學、同時擔負修理該家廟的責任、彼此互有利益、想來人民也能歡迎、　　乙　利用學宮書院及其他分共塲所、這事各地大多已經實行、用學宮書院等辦小學不應反對、　　丙、利用一切廟宇寺颧、一切廟宇寺觀都劃出一部份、讓給公家辦理小學、這與收没廟產不同、並且比僧道自辦小學的流弊較少、</p>
<p>丁、獎勵私人捐助房屋或捐資建築校舍富人所建别墅往往終年關閉、只供二三看守者的住宿、倘能捐助或借出一部份開辦小學、於公家極有利益、政府應勸導提倡、並給予相當的獎勵、至於捐資建築校舍、更應當特别獎勵、</p>
<p>戊　由公家籌建一種極經濟而能耐久的校舍、並訂定一種簡單而敵用的設備標準、供各地方</p>
<p>採用、凡中央及國庫所撥的補助費、應用一部份、作建築校舍的經費、</p>
<p>約略沽計、用舊式房屋改建一敎室、至少需欵二百元、每敎室内所需各種設備、亦須三百元左右、、所以每開一班、共需開辦費五百元、（未完）</p>

<p>自由談付之一笑　  海客　　公園執事—對不起。小姐。你可能立一立麽。近視女子—爲甚麽。（很懷疑的從長椅上立起來）　　公園執事—因爲我要貼上一張「油漆未乾」的字條。　　甲—你這一隻書架古色古香。再好没有了。但你爲甚麽不放些書在上面。　　乙—我本來有很多的書。只爲要買這書架。手頭没有錢。所以把那些書都賣掉了。　　老祖父（向幼孫）-你看現在是甚麽時候了。孩子們不是應該去睡覺了麽。　　幼孫—這不關我的事。因爲我自已没有孩子。　　甲—他老人家欠我五萬塊錢。已拖延到三年之久了。　　乙—他是大富翁。怎麽會欠你的錢。况且你也不像有五萬塊錢借給人啊。　　甲—因爲他規定女兒出嫁。有奩資五萬。可是我和他的女兒訂婚已有三年。他老是不肯給我們結婚。這不是與欠我五萬塊錢一樣麽。意大利取締男子奇装運動  嵇覲　　意大利自墨索里尼氏當國後。對於一般男子之奇異服装。斥爲女化式的男性。不時加以取締。最近全國之重工言論機關。如法斯託克公報。以及羅馬朝野日報之含有狄克推多主義者。（即著名之）棒喝黨）莫不深表同情。每有祗毁痛駡之論文發表。茲節譯一則如下。　　世上不少男化式的女性。至如我國。常有女化工式的男性。彼固不特侵入女子習慣。而亦湔染女子之特殊装束。傷風敗俗。莫此爲甚。吾人試往公衆塲所一觀　。見有此等忘却本來面目之男子。髮則光滑而後垂。兩顂芳潤。日塗以香油花膏等物。内衣爲絲製者。其色紅綠藍黃玫瑰紫不一。而外衣稱之。繡花垂帶。頗不耐觀。試問此輩男子。果有在社會上立足之地位乎。凡抱狄克推多義者。不容有女化式的男性。污我國體。非以嚴刑峻法驅除而滅絕之不可。　　據一般人之論調。以爲欲反對女化式的男性。宜先從對方的女性入手。凡奇装艷服。亦應一律取締。識者韙之。故近來西報。載有意大利女子。一槪不准參加國際美麗比賽會之說。並制定婦女服装式樣。修裙窄領。長袖平履。宛如十四世纪羅馬古装。其顏色一取沈靜淡雅。以灰綠藍白爲主。如是則一般女化式的男性。自然形銷並滅。無復有從前之怪現象矣。姑誌之以觀其後。解决民食問題  半蘭　　米貴如珠。貧民興數米而炊之歎。民食問題。急待解决。頗聞產地米價。亦已騰貴。限制價格。不過暫時補救。正恐一經限制。勢將來源頓少也。且使終能限制。價已過高。貧民亦復難堪。然則如之何而可。愚意宜提倡食麥以代米。查小麥一宗。本爲常用糧食。乃近來麵粉。價亦昻貴。惟大麥元麥。供槽坊家造　酒之用。。田家或以豢豖。或以飼鷄鴨。其價較賤。嘉定等純種棉豆之區。貧家往往食大麥。元麥。其法屑之以和入米。炊爲飯。其氣頗香。食旣慣。使食純粹米飯。反不適口。惟屑之和米同煑。米易軟而麥屑較硬。慣食米者或不習。法猶未盡善也。民國十五年。秋收大歉。來年米價騰貴。余家提倡食麥。改良方法。　將元麥於石臼内春之。颺去其皮。再春再颺。經三四次。儼然米粒。（偶用夫麥。亦如之。）不必磨之成屑。煑時先入鍋。煑一二沸。然後入米。共煑成飯。其氣香。其質軟。至爲可口。漸次增麥减米。嘗試用麥十之八。用米僅二成。食之亦甚佳。以米價比之。節省多矣。且食麥之有益身體。遠勝水田之米。凡稍具常識者。類能言之。一舉兩利。是在熱心提倡者之登高一呼。庶幾萬山皆應耳。惟春去其反。手續甚煩。且石臼甚小。農家備之。爲碓粉春穀之用。工商家無此也。余嘗焦唇敝舌以勸人。人每以手續麻煩爲困難。欲期普及。切望有心人。與碾米廠家。共同研究碾麥之法。俾我貧民。可出錢買得去皮之元麥大麥。無手續之煩。免相碍其所業工作之時間。自然人人樂從。利益溥徧矣。方今科學昌明時代。區颧碾去麥皮之法。發明當亦無難。不禁企足試目望之。（按元麥本名𪍣麥。以粒子較圓。故稱圓麥。糧食行家。省筆寫作元麥。耳。）淸明一典祭詞人  履冰　　余友李君伯壎。曾游學英京。專習航海。前於席間相値。談及關於淸明掃祭一事。頗堪以供筆錄。淸明佳節。無論在中在西。（西國稱爲復活節）均有掃墓獻花之舉。雖爲日不必一。而紀念屍死者。彼此用意固畫同也。據李君述。英國考察西地方。距市數里外。山明水秀。靑塜獨多。每屆西歷復活節。巨商名流。以及閨秀名媛。均携香花鮮葩。來此弔祭。墓前冷靜之塲。頓成喧閙。内有一塜。形式甚華。佔地甚廣。年逢斯曰。率有若干女郎。於掃基供圈之後。環立周圍。歌「百年人老」曲。歌聲淸越。足慰泉壞幽魂。*而遠近來觀者。亦羣歎墓中人後福不置。傳聞此土爲十八世紀中葉某女文豪（姓名已忘）葬地。文豪生前。以筆墨積資頗富。其最精心愜意之作。厥爲百年人老一歌。臨終之際。將產之一部。捐助附近女校。惟須於每歲淸明。來墓歌祭。使死而有知。聆斯得意文字。當堪心慰云云。李君所談如此。事誠有諸。是亦淸明之佳話也。屈臣氏照相部參觀記  誠言　　我國攝影事業。近來益見進步。研究此道者。因而愈見衆多。老友張瑞鎏兄。爲油墨商巨子麗雲先生長公子。曩在南洋大學肄業時。即以長於攝影鳴全校。當時並擔任該校攝影部主任。南洋影社社長等職。憶四載前南洋舉行三十周紀念。本報敎育攔所刊照片。多出自張君手。其攝影冲晒之成績。當時已頗可驚。厥後更潛心研究攝影術。去歲更在柯達公司實習一載。其技乃益見精進矣。　　今年君爲屈臣氏藥房聘爲照相材料部主任。一昨値君於途。君悉愚又將赴京。因邀往參觀屈臣氏攝影部正焉。入門即爲。照相材料部。舖面布置絕美。頗具思想。舉凡攝影用品。莫不全備。並有最新式之家庭電影攝影映放機。小巧精美。其冲晒部在厦後。分三間。遍置機械。放在晒影吹乾等等。莫不用最新式之機。織員忙於工作。君亦間加指揮。桌上置放大之片十數。其中以同學馮孟齡玉影爲尤具美態。張君謂渠不惜工本以組織。並不求利。祗在使全滬攝影界能知有屈臣氏照相部而已。參觀旣竟。愚佩張君進取之毅力。爲不可多得。退而作記。且願攝影家之知屈臣氏照相部有不可多得之成績焉。山僧掘獲佳卉之所聞  桑侯甫　　吾鄉上虞多山。尤以西南兩鄉爲最。四圍岡峯兀立。山嶺生疊。西鄉有山曰蘭芎。距上虞縣城約二十里許。是山松木葱蘢。雜產蘭草。風景絕勝。山中有古刹一。顏曰福仙禪院。廣厦連雲。氣象壯偉。計深及七進。古蹟綦夥。爲虞邑名勝之一。建自唐咸康八年。内有明先賢倪元璐讀書處。及晋時葛洪煉丹池。曁劉伯温釣台諸跡。寺後有圯塔一。塔基猶在。相傳係毁於洪楊亂時。迄今斷碑殘碣。凌亂山谷。胥已糢糊莫辨。荒蕪不堪。不佞日前以掃墓曾返鄉一行。盛傳該院有寺僧名阿明者。於三月二十四日淸晨時。隻身徐步蹀　其間。於無意中陡聞有淸香陣陣。撲鼻而入。一時爲好奇心所驅使。欲一覘其究竟。亟向就近山谷尋覓。須臾果於圮塔亂石間。瞥見有蘭草一本。花二支。葉數莖。時正綻蕊欲放。嗅之幽香逾恒。一若麝香之氣然。逈異常種。迺以竹爿掘獲。移植盆中。以供案頭淸賞。初不料其爲蘭中珍品。詎越日遽爲識者所見。謂引蘭確爲永豐梅。亦名王者香。係蘭花中之最名貴者。價値連城。得之非易。於是衆僧以此蘭在寺旁所掘獲。理屬公有之物。僉欲變售與之分潤。互相爭執。擾攘不已。旋爲邑中耆紳夙有蘭癖者之趙某所悉。即出價洋八百四十元購得。其洋作十二股分派。計阿明獨得五股。領洋三百五十元。餘僧各得一股。照數分攤。其事始寢云。滑稽常識  持佛　　應酬讌會之時。必須遲到。到則即打電話。以表示忙迫之態。則主人必以其爲紅人而敬之。　　公衆集會之處。斷不可默默無言。儘可大着膽量。談天說地。信口開河。可爲將來交紅運之基礎。　　寗可吃勿着落。衣服不可不舒齊。　　與人上酒館戲院待時候。應努力以手揷入袋中。作摸錢狀。但千萬不可摸出錢來。而口中只管說我來。我來。　　「大佛誁命拜。小佛跌一脚。」是處世唯一的常識。　　交富友應該裝闊綽。交窮友應該裝貧窮。庶幾有益無損。　　　富人出入。應該改坐飛機。可免綁票之險。　　做小說不必管内容結構。只要想出一個得艷動人的名目。包你賺錢。包人上當。東游通訊  吳孝侯　　（三）長崎神户道中　　長崎至神户一帶海道。日本稱爲内海。風平浪靜。水秀山淸。俗呼安寗海。記者所乘之上海丸。又爲五千三百噸之巨輪。設備完美。舟和殊適。下午五時。由長崎起椗後。時屆薄暮。沿海兩岸羣島。星羅棋布。暮色蒼茫中。憑欄遠眺。見諸島有若炊烟四起者。細審之。乃辨爲工廠烟囱。詢悉日本内地各市埠。已均開發無餘。工廠不得已乃於沿海諸島闢地建築。日興朋累。此安寗海之羣島。遂致烟囱矗立殆遍。亦可見日本工業之鼎盛矣。　　船中晚七時許開放電影。以娱船客。座中晤浙人姜延恩。係上海大中華賽璐珞製廠總理兼總工程師。以參觀工廠赴東。原係日本高等工校工業學士。又衛生部中央衛生試騐所長陳君。係日帝大醫學博士。率所屬赴日參觀衛生設備者。二君均深嫻日語。記者正以華語於舟中旣不通行。即用英語。亦多隔閡。得晤兩君。並偕往之杜女士曁毛君等。頭等艙中。已有五同國之人。可共晨夕。旣破岑寂。且二君昔時均旅日甚久。於日之國勢民情。頗多指導。俾記者赴東後。不致有盲人瞎馬之感。尤深欣幸。　　離長之翌晨。天已大放晴光。起視遠山如黛。天空紅雲爭妍。秋景撩人。悠然意遠。下午四時。舟抵押神户下椗。此爲中日聯航快線最後一埠之終點。舍舟登陸。因在申係購由滬直赴東京之車船聯票。不克久延。（神户之考察。俟東京。橫濱。名古屋。大阪。等考察畢後。順道爲之。）　赴神户三之宮車站。在咖啡館略進晚餐後。即附下午八時特别急行夜車。（如吾華之特快車。）至日之國都。翌晨八時。即抵東就驛車站。詢悉由神户至東京。計日里三百七十里。每一日里。約合華里六里强。以共合華里二千三百餘里之遙。十里之遙。十二小時。即能馳達。較諸吾華所謂最優良之寧滬車。八小時祗行七百餘里者。不啻霄壤。蓋日本全國火車。均係雙軌。無交車候車之延。且機頭爲極新式者。（惟日本鐡道路軌。較世界普通路軌爲狹。祗能行於國内。詢悉最初爲美國某公）司所承造。恐爲他人奪其營業。因將路軌造狹。期爲獨占之事業。彼時日人未深注意。嗣頗感不便。特現時日本於車軌全部。均能自製。承造權終未爲美公司所獨占耳。）燃料亦佳。致收如此迅疾之效也。綴玉軒遊美雜錄  來　　此間將移居。現已看妥一房。月租約美金一千二百元。日内可定規。惟在美停留若干日。尙未能定。因各大埠皆有人來約。故至早亦須五六月間回國。舊金山已派人來接洽。大致定於四月十五日往彼演唱。然因在紐尙須續演與否。波士頓芝加哥兩處各演若干日。皆未商訂妥洽。故未能即與議定。今日已有便人往波士頓接洽。墨西哥有人來約往演唱。因太費事。恐不能成行。最近計劃演唱之期間。假定紐約至少四星期。波士頓二星期。費城三日。華盛頓二日。芝加哥一星期。好萊塢一星期。舊金山中國街十日。埠中一星期。其餘各城兩星期。此是最少限度。據劇塲大致言之。皆未定奪。　　下星期五爲哥倫布大學敎授公會之茶話會。又哥倫布大學亦擬開一公共茶會歡迎畹華。大致在下星期之末矣。此皆重要宴會之一也。近來哥倫布大學及紐約大學之各敎授。大多數皆來觀劇。并皆於講堂上勸告學生。應當往觀。故大學生來觀者甚多。哥倫布大學校長來看過五次。曾向中國學生云。梅君此次來美。能得此美譽。吾實爲中國慶幸云云。</p>

<h3 id="e10">Central Executive Committee Advises Armed Comrades in the Third District <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Executive Committee issued a letter to the armed comrades in the Third Reorganization District on the 7th, saying, "Our party, inheriting the legacy of the President and in response to the demands of the people, launched the Northern Expedition in the 15th year. In less than a year, the speed of the revolutionary forces' progress was extraordinarily unusual. By the time the capital was established in Nanjing, the country was unified with doctrine, and the people were given peace and rest. The implementation of reorganization and efforts in the construction of political tutelage have increasingly consolidated the foundation of the party and the country. Although the remnants of reactionary feudalism have erupted one after another, in an attempt to achieve the selfishness of one person or one faction, they have all been successively suppressed and cannot survive. This is partly due to the deep-rooted nature of our party's doctrine in the hearts of the people, which is sufficient to overcome everything, and partly due to the fearless spirit of our armed comrades, who have worked hard and fought, which has led to this. Over the years, all the new and old warlords who have lived under the doctrine of our party, as well as all reactionary forces, have relied on the loyalty and bravery of our armed comrades to be successfully suppressed. The central government has also used this to continue to realize the hope of the country and the people for future peace and unification, as well as the effectiveness of political tutelage. Yan Xishan, the rebel, used his insidious and cunning nature to deceive the central government's leniency and regard the people's suffering as insignificant. Forgetting his appearance, he added to the deceit and incitement. Recently, he has colluded with all reactionary elements outside the country, claiming to be soldiers and rebelling against the central government, in an attempt to make one last stand. The central government, considering the people's livelihood and the urgency of construction, has always been lenient and adhered to the policy of peaceful unification, unwilling to rashly resort to arms because of Yan Xishan alone, and to make our armed comrades in the Third Reorganization District unfortunately make meaningless sacrifices, and to trap the people of the north in suffering. Therefore, the government's order to dismiss and arrest him has been delayed until now, in accordance with the principle of taking good with it, hoping for his last repentance. All of this should be witnessed and understood by the people of the whole country and our armed comrades across the country. Now that Yan's rebellious actions are obvious, the people of the country all say he should be killed. He will inevitably take risks. The central government is deeply concerned that all the armed comrades in our Third Reorganization District will be oppressed and held by Yan due to environmental factors, and will be trapped in the path of betraying the party and the country, destroying their glorious history. The armed comrades in our Third Reorganization District must know that each comrade has made contributions during the Northern Expedition, which is well known, and that obedience to the party and the country is the duty of a revolutionary soldier. The central government is the central government of the whole country. All those who resist the central government, break the policies of the central government, and trap the people in suffering are the public enemies of the people of the whole country. Looking back on the past, they can only move towards destruction. Therefore, what to do is not only a matter of great righteousness, but also a matter of interests. At this critical moment, should we wait for the wise to distinguish it? Now, I sincerely inform you, hoping that all comrades will deeply understand and return. Our comrades should regard themselves as the pillars of the Republic of China. How can we be willing to be Yan's hawks and dogs? Fortunately, we pulled ourselves out in the past and did not follow Yan as slaves to Hongxian's imperial system. How can we be willing to follow Yan again today and become evil traitors of the Republic of China? The valuable thing about revolutionary soldiers is to adhere to the doctrine, distinguish between obedience and rebellion, not be tempted by profit, not be threatened, and always complete their revolutionary aspirations and maintain the glory of history. I hope my comrades will work hard. (Special telegram on the 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e11">Central Executive Committee Instructs Party Members in Shanxi, Hebei, Suiyuan, and Chahar <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Executive Committee issued instructions on the 7th to party members in Shanxi, Hebei, Pingjin, Suiyuan, and Chahar, saying, "Our party, inheriting the legacy of the President and leading the national revolution, has been sincere and consistent until now. The violent warlords have been almost completely eliminated, the people's faith has become increasingly popular, peaceful construction has been gradually implemented, and foreign policy has been gradually carried out. All these achievements, if not for the struggle of all our party comrades, how could we have achieved this? The central government takes peaceful unification as its sole policy, and over the years, its military and party measures have all been based on this purpose. It is true that destruction has just ended, and construction cannot be delayed, and if society is unstable for a day, the people will not be able to recuperate and recuperate for a day, and construction undertakings will not be able to proceed, and China's freedom and equality will not be achieved overnight. In the past, for those who instigated chaos, when their rebellious actions were not obvious, we still hoped that they would repent and start anew. We would never be willing to see internal wars again unless it was absolutely necessary, to cause suffering to the people. However, the reactionary warlord Yan Xishan was originally a remnant of the imperial system, cunning by nature, and fickle. He was forced by the general trend to return, hoping to protect himself. Seeing that the central government was becoming more and more revolutionary, and that reorganization was inevitable, and that feudal separatism could not last, he fabricated words and incited, and made false claims. The central government was lenient and only gave him earnest advice and did not punish him immediately, hoping that he would be self-aware and enlightened. However, he harbored the intention of making trouble, was lost and did not return, and actually mobilized troops and openly rebelled, colluding with all the traitors of the party and the country, and the remaining warlords, not hesitating to sacrifice the compatriots who were suffering from the disaster in the north, in order to make a final struggle. Recently, the party branches in Shanxi, Hebei, Pingjin and other places, and the organs established by the central government, have been forcibly closed, and loyal comrades have been arrested. Proper public opinion has been destroyed, and they have used false titles and dared to be the head of the army, in order to split our Republic of China and become the hawks and tools of imperialism. It seems that such a chaotic party harms the country, rebels against the central government, and the crime is punishable. The central government is deeply convinced that the foundation of the revolution is solid, and the prestige of the central government is increasing day by day. At this point, it cannot be shaken by any reactionary force, and the stubborn reactionary warlords, who cannot be touched, cannot but be quickly wiped out. It has now been passed by the Standing Committee of the Central Committee and resolved by the Supervisory Committee, and Yan Xishan has been expelled from the party, and the National Government has issued a clear order to dismiss and arrest him. Yan has already cut himself off from the party and the country, and is therefore unpardonable by party discipline and national law. The President's declaration of the Northern Expedition once said that the purpose of the Northern Expedition was not only to overthrow Cao and Wu, but also to prevent the same people from rising up after Cao and Wu were overthrown. Now Yan's actions are intended to follow Cao and Wu, and if this is not eliminated, the national revolution</p>
<p>will never be completed. Our comrades in Shanxi, Hebei, Pingjin, Suiyuan, and Chahar have been under the tyranny of reactionary warlords for a long time, and after a long period of struggle, they have been able to face the present day and have been brutally treated. I am deeply saddened. However, in the past, comrades worked hard to revolutionize and oppose warlords, and were often able to sacrifice everything and not be subdued by injustice. In the future, we should continue to carry out this spirit and continue to move forward. Saving the party is saving the country. Our party, which has been created with hard work, has a great mission to build a new China, and must not allow any reactionary forces to harm it. Our comrades in Shanxi, Hebei, Pingjin, Suiyuan, and Chahar must, at this time of reactionary arrogance, confirm the history and personality of the revolution, base on the past experience, continue the spirit of the President's revolution, and work hard to struggle, so that the people of the whole country can understand where the obedience and rebellion are, and that the revolution and the counter-revolution cannot coexist.</p>
<p>Relying on this, all comrades should rise up and strive for it. (Special telegram on the 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e12">Chiang Drafts an Article to All Officers and Soldiers <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang has drafted an article for all officers and soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army, which will be published immediately. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>To all officers and soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army: The National Revolutionary Army originated in Guangzhou. In less than three years, it spread throughout the country. This is definitely not an accidental gain. The President's will, the first sentence, "I have dedicated myself to the national revolution for forty years, and its purpose is to seek the freedom and equality of China." The National Revolutionary Army is following the President's teachings, inheriting the President's legacy, and seeking China's freedom and equality as its own responsibility. Since the imperialists recklessly carried out aggression and used the warlords as their accomplices, causing China to fall into the status of a semi-colony, and the people are on the verge of economic bankruptcy, the declaration of the first National Congress has evaluated the plans for saving the country proposed by various parties and individuals at that time, and asserted that none of them were correct. Only by implementing the Three People's Principles through national revolution can China have a way out. However, this implementation of the national revolution, sweeping away all warlords in the country, and resisting the military oppression of the imperialists, requires soldiers who can truly sacrifice their lives for the national revolution. Therefore, in his later years, the President devoted his full efforts to cultivating revolutionary soldiers. The articles on the spiritual education of soldiers are even more encouraging to revolutionary soldiers. After the President's death, party comrades created the National Revolutionary Army, which is suitable for the needs of the country and the wishes of the people, and our revolutionary martyrs have succeeded one another, sacrificing their precious lives and defending the party and the country, so that they can complete the cause of national unity in the shortest period of time. The significance of our National Revolutionary Army is extremely important, and the history of the National Revolutionary Army is extremely glorious. It is neither owned privately by anyone nor can it be destroyed by anyone. Moreover, China's freedom and equality have not yet been achieved. Anyone with a heart cannot bear to hinder the progress of the national revolution, let alone a revolutionary soldier who takes saving the country and the people as his own responsibility. There is no reason to exist outside and take a separate path. It is also impossible to sit idly by and watch the National Revolutionary Army being destroyed without thinking of saving it. Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang were originally remnants of the warlords. Their joining the National Revolutionary Army was not sincere, but only a habitual trick of speculation and opportunism.</p>
<p>Has long been seen by the people of the country. However, their slander of the central government and their criticism of Zhongzheng are still carried out in the name of revolution. Now, the plan is exhausted and the dagger is exposed.</p>
<p>See, he has completely betrayed the national revolution, and even the name of the National Revolutionary Army has been abandoned. Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang gathered reactionary elements from various factions with extremely inconsistent interests. Their rhetoric often contradicted each other and there was no definite plan to save the country, which made people unable to fathom their intentions. Heaven has taken his soul, and he has revealed his mask of false revolution, clearly telling people that they have opposed the national revolution, unwilling to see China's freedom and equality, they have opposed the National Revolutionary Army, unwilling to challenge the entire revolutionary army, they have openly abandoned the great mission of the National Revolutionary Army, and are willing to trap the compatriots of the whole country in a situation of eternal ruin. The false revolutionaries have exposed their true colors and are hastening their own demise, which is fortunate in the revolutionary process. Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang's departure from the National Revolutionary Army is a great fortune for the National Revolutionary Army. However, if the officers and soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army do not work hard to kill the thieves and allow them to exist for one more day, then the National Revolutionary Army will be more ashamed for one day, and the success of the national revolution will be hindered for one more day. This is definitely not something that our revolutionary soldiers can tolerate. Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang want to maintain their feudal power and become enemies of the national revolution. This is truly a sinner of the people of the whole country. All those who are willing to dedicate themselves to the national revolution should rise up and condemn them. However, all officers and soldiers of our National Revolutionary Army should take into account their name and meaning, how can they inherit the President's legacy, how can they complete the revolutionary responsibility, how can they maintain the glory of history, and how can they relieve their own pain? They must fight the feudal forces with all their strength. The National Revolutionary Army and Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang cannot coexist. If Yan and Feng exist, the National Revolutionary Army will perish, and China will not be saved. Our officers and soldiers must have the greatest determination to sacrifice for the country and vow to eliminate this public enemy of the National Revolutionary Army with all their strength. The President once said that the revolutionary army must fight the national traitors with one against a hundred. He also said that the revolutionary army should take the martyrs as the standard, give up their lives to achieve benevolence, sacrifice all rights, and concentrate on saving the country. Since all the officers and soldiers know where the national traitors are, they will surely be loyal, brave, and strive to fight to win glory in the history of our army and to realize the freedom and equality of China. The spirit of the President and the deceased officers and soldiers in heaven is truly dependent on it. (Special telegram on the 7th)</p>

<h3 id="e13">Gandhi's Non-Violent Resistance in India <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Gandhi's non-violent resistance in India, breaking the salt law, is already underway. Regardless of whether it succeeds in the future, his actions of not seeking personal gain, not sacrificing others and acting as an example himself, fearing hardship, and not avoiding danger, are pure and sincere, and are truly seen and heard by the world. It is neither seeking private interests, nor privately avenging private hatreds. Harm falls first on oneself, and benefit extends to all people. This is truly rare and commendable.</p>
<p>People can prepare to lose money in order to trade for profit. People can prepare to sacrifice their own lives in order to fight with others. People can prepare to abandon all that they have in order to fight with others. Their doctrines may not be entirely correct, but their sincere intentions are known to others. It is not seeking luck, it is not speculation, it is not taking advantage of it for profit. It is clear to everyone. If one does not deeply understand that it is necessary to do so, and is forced to do so, then one will never do so.</p>
<p>A good deed that causes no loss to oneself can be done by everyone. A good deed that causes no loss to oneself and even brings benefits is something that everyone is happy to do. However, the good deeds of the world cannot be done so easily. Moreover, when seeking a right or recovering a benefit from the public, it is under strong pressure. Even seeking great gains with small sacrifices is still impossible. How can one act in a way that seeks luck and speculation in order to profit from it? Therefore, looking at Gandhi's non-violent resistance, he shoulders the burden and does not take shortcuts or seek profit. This can serve as an example for those who fight for the public.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The International Telecommunications Negotiation Committee of the Ministry of Communications held its first meeting with the Pacific Commercial Cable Company on the afternoon of the 7th. The committee members from the Ministry of Communications were Zhuang Zhihuan and four others. The company was represented by Tao Te, as Deputy Manager Di Gengji was still unwell. Zhuang Zhihuan delivered a speech, stating that the company completed the Pacific cable connecting the United States and China in 1904 and has been handling telecommunications with the Chinese Telegraph Administration for nearly 30 years. Now, due to changes in China's political and economic situation and its relationship with international telecommunications, the telecommunications contracts previously signed with the company and Great Northern Telegraph Company and Eastern Extension Australasia and China Telegraph Company are no longer applicable. In the future, international telecommunications should be developed in accordance with the Chinese Kuomintang's party platform, the Premier's teachings, and the spirit of Chinese national independence. Sino-American relations are traditionally strong and the distance between them is vast. Telecommunications</p>
<p>should be vigorously promoted to bring the governments and people of the two countries closer and more friendly. Therefore, it is hoped that the company will sympathize with the new telegram transmission methods to be agreed upon. This meeting will first discuss and determine the outline, then discuss the details, and achieve satisfactory results in the shortest possible time. Tao Te then replied, stating that the company's cable has been communicating with China for more than 20 years and is truly the only tool for transmitting news between the United States and China. He hoped that both parties would cooperate sincerely to achieve satisfactory results. They then exchanged views and adjourned. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Relief Association Opposes Monetization</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Beiping Shaanxi Relief Association requested the China International Famine Relief Commission to monetize the relief grain because it could not be transported to Shaanxi and remit the cash to Shaanxi for officials to distribute. The China International Famine Relief Commission discussed this today and did not agree, stating that there are no military affairs between Beiping and Shaanxi. If there is sincerity in assisting relief, only two or three rows of covered wagons are needed to distribute it. If the grain is monetized, there will be losses in price, and there is no guarantee that the cash will benefit the disaster victims when it arrives in Shaanxi. Therefore, they replied, requesting that wagons still be prepared to send grain to Shaanxi. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Naval Conference Enters Liquidation Phase</p>
<p>Britain, the United States, and Japan Now Have a Concrete Agreement</p>
<p>There Is Still Hope for a Five-Power Agreement</p>
<p>Tokyo, July 7th, Japanese United Press - A telegram from London on the 6th stated that the naval disarmament conference has entered the liquidation phase this week and is scheduled to discuss the flexible issue of submarines at a special committee meeting on the afternoon of the 8th. However, it seems that Britain and the United States are unwilling to easily agree</p>
<p>to flexibility, or it is said that they are unwilling to recognize even 10% of flexibility. However, there seems to be hope for an agreement on the construction of light cruisers and destroyers. The issue of retaining Japan's freedom to build large cruisers is also relatively easy to resolve. Therefore, Britain, the United States, and Japan will draft a treaty within this period. If France and Italy withdraw from the conference, it can be closed before Easter.</p>
<p>London, July 6th, Reuters - U.S. Representative Gibson sent a radio telegram to the U.S. reporting on the progress of the Naval Conference, stating that Britain, the United States, and Japan have reached a concrete agreement in the past week. The three countries' fleets will jointly dismantle nine battleships without replenishment. According to this method, the Japanese fleet will have nine battleships. Therefore, the battleships dismantled by the three countries' fleets are numerically equal to the third largest battleship fleet in the world. Furthermore, according to last week's agreement, no battleships will be built in the next six years. The Naval Conference also agreed to limit the basis for various warships of the three countries. Therefore, the tonnage of cruisers, destroyers, and submarines of the three countries will be lower than the minimum limit discussed in Geneva in 1927. As for the current discussions between Britain, France, and Italy, there is still hope for a five-power agreement.</p>
<p>London, July 6th, Reuters - French Foreign Minister Briand returned to Paris last night to report everything to the government and is expected to return around Tuesday. London has no important announcements for the time being. There will be nine questions in the House of Commons tomorrow, all related to the political issues of the Naval Conference and Article 16 of the League of Nations Charter, fearing that the formula for interpreting the article contains the meaning of a guarantee to France. However, the Prime Minister has repeatedly stated that the British government is willing to determine the extent of British obligations, but is not prepared to increase its burden. The Observer reported that if a far-reaching disarmament agreement is to be reached, France is indispensable. If the existing obligations in the League of Nations Charter or the Locarno Agreement with Germany can be reaffirmed to satisfy France and accommodate the scope of disarmament, it is the responsibility of British diplomats to find a way to achieve it. The British delegation's opinion is probably like this.</p>
<p>Rome, July 6th, National Press - Italian newspapers commented on the Five-Power Naval Conference, mostly believing that a breakdown is imminent and repeatedly claiming that Italy will never accept a formula that is flexible and ambiguous, which France strongly desires to be approved at the meeting. As the Italian Kirang News said, Italy will never abandon its demand to be a naval power equal to France, and will not yield even under pressure. Even if this conference ends without results, the responsibility for its failure should not be borne by Italy. The Forum News also said that the only achievement of this Naval Conference is to accurately show that the countries that formerly fought together cannot reach an agreement. Paris, July 6th, National Press - Briand returned to Paris from London yesterday and will return to London on Tuesday to make a final effort to avoid the breakdown of the conference. However, at present, newspapers and political circles are increasingly impatient with the Naval Conference and no longer have any hope of success. Only officialdom still believes that a way can be found to preserve the face of the five powers and prevent them from separating.</p>
<p>New York, July 5th, National Press - U.S. Ambassador to Belgium Gibson gave a speech on the radio station in London today and was broadcast to the whole country by various radio stations in the United States. He said that there are good reasons to hope that a five-power agreement can be signed before we leave London. This can be known within these few days.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Use of Surplus Funds After Japanese Disarmament <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Military Authorities Plan to Expand Air Force Strength</p>
<p>Tokyo, July 7th, Electric Communications Agency - The government is paying attention to how much of the surplus funds from disarmament will be used to reduce the burden on the people, that is, tax cuts and other social policies. The navy believes that there are many points of dissatisfaction in national defense in this agreement and intends to request new funding to strengthen naval power to compensate. The government and the party intend to recognize the navy's request to a considerable extent, but most of it is still intended to be used for tax cuts and social policies to fulfill its commitment to the people. Therefore, although the three-country agreement can be successful, there are still problems in domestic politics. The Seiyukai said that although the disarmament agreement can be established, this agreement was established in disregard of the military's opposition. It seems that huge expenses are required to strengthen the naval power outside the agreement. It is doubtful whether it can be used for tax cuts. Currently, the agreement on maintaining shipbuilding power has not yet been established. Therefore, the amount of surplus financial resources cannot be determined. If the navy's request is fully accommodated, then the tax cut is completely hopeless. Therefore, this disarmament is still equal to zero. Therefore, when compiling the budget, it is necessary to cut the navy's request or find new financial resources. However, the Ministry of Finance hopes to use 20 million yuan for tax cuts. If it is only this amount, it may not be difficult. Tokyo, July 7th, Japanese United Press - Today, the newspapers here published their editorials, discussing the use of the shipbuilding fees saved after the establishment of the disarmament agreement, and all opposed the navy's idea of diverting them to aviation maintenance, advocating that they be used to reduce the burden on the people.</p>
<p>Tokyo, July 7th, Japanese United Press - During this military and political reform, the Army Department plans to expand the Hang Kong Force. In recent days, it has sent members of the Military and Political Investigation Committee to inspect various flying teams and flying schools to study the methods of changing their content. In the future, each army must have at least one unit, but the cost is very high, with each heavy bomber costing 200,000 yuan and each light bomber costing 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. The Ministry of Military Affairs plans to sacrifice other types of aircraft teams and schools to seek the expansion of the bomber unit.</p>
<p>Tokyo, July 7th, Electric Communications Agency - The General Staff believes that according to this agreement, the strength of the three-country treaty cannot completely maintain national defense, and intends to draft a new expansion plan. The Navy Province refers to the plan of the General Staff. In order to compensate for the lack of submarine strength, it intends to greatly expand the air force, continue for five years, and request construction fees of 150 million yuan and maintenance fees of 100 million yuan by the eleventh year, totaling 250 million yuan. In order to compensate for the failure to implement the 70% requirement for large cruisers, it intends to request special expenses, such as modification fees, repair fees, exercise fees, and fuel fees. After the overall agreement is reached, it will submit a concrete plan.</p>

<p>People's Salt Is Sometimes Confiscated</p>
<p>Ellorkat, July 6th, Reuters - Non-violent resisters made salt on the shores of Salt Lake today, and many people came to watch. However, they were blocked by the police half a mile from the lake. The salt makers gave salt to the reporters at the scene. The Reuters reporter also got a little salt. This salt has not been refined and looks like sand, but it tastes salty. In the evening, some people sold refined salt made by the people in Kalkat. The price was surprisingly high. What usually sells for one rupee was sold for twenty-five rupees. Although this refined salt can be regarded as a commodity, it is still questionable whether it is absolutely edible. Kanta, July 6th, Reuters - Twenty-nine members of the Kuomintang destroyed the salt tax today six miles from Kanta. National tax officers confiscated and destroyed the made salt, destroyed the equipment for boiling seawater, and arrested three people.</p>
<p>New Delhi, July 6th, Reuters - There is no sign of fierce non-violent resistance in Upper India. There are occasional parades and public gatherings in various places, and people's salt is also confiscated, but no disturbances have been reported. Governor-General Irwin set off today to tour the Northwest Frontier and is scheduled to go to Simla on April 17. Bombay, July 6th, Reuters - Gandhi's main lieutenant, Kotari, led 55 volunteers, each carrying five pounds of salt. This morning, they arrived in Vilaga, 40 miles from Ahmedabad, and were seen by the police chief, who immediately arrested them and confiscated their salt. Kotari was sentenced to a fine of 500 rupees, or six weeks in prison.</p>

<p>Reuters, Bombay, 6th - This morning, striking workers of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway clashed with police at Kola Station, eight miles from here, resulting in seven people being shot and injured by the police. The chairman of the Railway Workers' Union and the leader of the strikers at Kola Station have both been arrested. Strikers began non-violent resistance at Chaina Station, twelve miles from here, standing in groups on the tracks to block the train, but were dispersed by Baluchistan police. Four policemen were injured by stones thrown by the crowd.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 6th - Railway strikers marched in teams today, each carrying red flags, along the railway lines, attempting to stop trains. When trains passed, they were pelted with stones. A total of nineteen strikers have now been arrested, six of whom have been sentenced to three weeks in prison. Reuters, New York, 7th - Lieutenant Hawks, aboard a towed glider, has safely arrived at the Pacific coast from the Atlantic coast. The glider was towed by an airplane using a cable. Today, at an altitude of 5,000 feet over Van Cortlandt Park, the tow cable was cut, and Hawks' glider gracefully landed on the ground as scheduled. This is a groundbreaking event in aviation history.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Washington, 6th - According to today's news, Congressman Smith has sought input from the Chinese Embassy regarding his proposed Chinese disaster relief plan. Smith has previously discussed this matter with the Chinese Disaster Relief Association, which has expressed strong support. The plan involves first purchasing a large quantity of grain in the United States, milling it into wheat flour, and then shipping it to China. The expenses will be reimbursed by the Chinese government in installments according to established procedures. All those who have witnessed the disaster situation in China unanimously acknowledge the severity of the disaster. However, public opinion remains concerned about the interference of northern military personnel in the disaster relief efforts, despite repeated denials from the Chinese side. Recent news from Chicago indicates that Mr. Clark recently returned from Beiping, having personally witnessed the tragic conditions in the disaster-stricken areas. He stated that the reports of the disaster situation received in the United States only reflect the national reality. According to Mr. Clark's opinion, it would be more appropriate to remit the funds to China and have China purchase food for disaster relief.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Washington, 6th - Thirteen years ago today marked the date of the US declaration of war against Germany. Currently, the major powers are working together in London to eliminate the scourge of war, but progress is slow, and the outcome remains uncertain. Today, the world has more than six million people under arms in 58 countries. Naval competition, except for battleships, remains unrestricted. The Five-Power Naval Treaty is gradually fading into oblivion within these few days. A Three-Power agreement may be established, and the Atlantic and Pacific regions may be temporarily calm, but in the Mediterranean region, unless the differences between Italy and France can be reconciled, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan will have no significant ability to influence the situation. Today, the entire United States is commemorating the day, and troops in various locations are conducting drills. Special prayers are also being held in classrooms.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 6th - On the eve of the anniversary of the US declaration of war against Germany, the Treasury Department compiled the losses suffered by the United States in the European War, amounting to US$51,400,000,000.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Washington, 6th - According to a group of astute observers, even if the proposal to tax silver is implemented, it will be difficult to improve the global silver market situation. Moreover, it is feared that it will not only be unhelpful but also harmful. The US Department of Commerce recently conducted an investigation into this matter, stating that fixing the price of silver could greatly benefit global commerce, but in reality, it is feared that silver will continue to maintain its historically volatile characteristics. It is generally believed here that China's adoption of the gold standard is still a long way off because China lacks sufficient cash and the authority to control its use.</p>

<p>Central Party Headquarters: At 9:00 AM on the 7th, the Central Party Headquarters held its 54th Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week in the Grand Auditorium. Approximately 500 people attended, including Central Committee members, staff from various departments and committees, and guests. After Chairman Sun Ke offered his respects, Liu Luyin reported that the Central Government had ordered a punitive expedition against Yan Xishan's rebellion. Before issuing the order, the Central Government adopted a lenient approach, using various peaceful methods to persuade and influence him, so that he would consider the suffering of the people and cooperate to complete the revolutionary cause. However, recently, peaceful methods have proven ineffective. The Central Government's painstaking efforts to achieve the peaceful unification goal in Sun Yat-sen's teachings have been</p>

<h3 id="e61">Excerpts from Important News, Part 2 <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Absolutely not accepting; treason becoming increasingly clear; remnants being recruited; fully entering a state of war; in past rebellions, such as the Gui clique rebellion, Feng Yuxiang's two rebellions, Tang Shengzhi's rebellion, and Shi Yousan's mutiny, none were not secretly instigated by Yan Xishan and used as a tool for disruption; their blatant actions have long been seen through by the central government; the reason for not immediately exposing them was simply to allow them to realize their errors on their own, to guide them towards good, and to maintain a peaceful situation; however, they still believe that the central government has not seen through their tricks, acting willfully without any scruples; how utterly foolish; Yan Xishan is accustomed to playing tricks, always using others as sacrifices; this time, even if someone is willing to be used by him again, he is determined not to directly bear the brunt himself; let us analyze the content of his rebellion; Yan, in order to hold the reins of the Northern Warlords, recognizes Feng Yuxiang as a formidable enemy, whose power must be overthrown; therefore, he incited Feng to rebel, when the first rebellion occurred, Yan ostensibly helped Feng, but actually helped the central government to hasten his defeat; he took the opportunity to incorporate his retreating troops to expand his own strength; subsequently, he deceived Feng into staging a second rebellion; when the central government forces reached Tongguan, he again wanted to seize the opportunity to eliminate the remnants of the Northwest Army, while simultaneously imprisoning Feng Yuxiang in Shanxi; this kind of conspiracy is deeply resented by many in the Northwest Army; this time, he is again letting Feng enter Shaanxi, assisting Feng in making trouble; Feng's troops do not believe that Yan's attempt can succeed, but are merely using this to extort military supplies and equipment, getting as much as they can; if one speaks of genuine alliance, no one can believe it; as for using the reorganized faction's disruptive methods, he believes that he has succeeded, but Chen Gongbo is essentially a speculator, seeking only profit; he has successively been a cat's paw for the Communist Party, Wang Jingwei, Li Zongren, and Tang Shengzhi, and each time he failed to get money; this time, he has hatched the same old scheme, but Yan is so cunning and shrewd, it is uncertain whether he will be deceived by Chen; now that the punitive order has been issued, military affairs are becoming increasingly tense; given the central government's strength and the precedents of suppressing rebellions in the past, it is believed that all counter-revolutionary factions can be quickly eliminated and completely wiped out; while one side uses force to suppress the existing rebellion, the other side should still use sincerity to influence and eliminate future rebellions; furthermore, peaceful construction methods should be used to consolidate the foundation of the party and the nation; as for the reasons why counter-revolutionary factions dare to rebel repeatedly, (1) it is because the people of the whole country have failed to jointly shoulder the responsibility of citizens, using genuine vision and great strength to clearly distinguish right from wrong, so that they have scruples and dare not recklessly defy what is right; (2) domestic public opinion has not been able to fully restrain and severely criticize all reactionary factions, causing the general public to still not recognize right from wrong, thereby weakening their concept of the nation; it is hoped that all comrades in the party will work hard to be responsible for propaganda, so that the reactionary faction will never rise again after it has fallen, and so on; the report was finished, and the meeting adjourned at 10:30.</p>
<p>The National Government held a memorial week for Sun Yat-sen at 10 a.m. on the same day; those present included Chiang Kai-shek, Tan Yankai, Wang Chonghui, Gu Yingfen, Soong Tzu-wen, Chu Pei-te, Chen Shaokuan, He Yaozu, Jin Handing, Yi Peiji, Liu Ruiheng, Zhang Nanxian, Yang Jie, etc., and more than 300 officials and military officers from the National Government; Chiang Kai-shek presided over the meeting; after the ceremony, Chiang made the following report:</p>
<p>"Fellow comrades, on Thursday, April 1, Yan Xishan assumed the false post of Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Republic of China; Feng Yuxiang and Li Zongren also followed suit, assuming the false posts of Deputy Commander-in-Chief; this matter has already been published in various newspapers, and you must all know about it; although this matter seems significant, from the perspective of our revolutionary stance, it is not a big deal; they [Yan Xishan] are very afraid of the name of the National Revolution; not only warlords fear the word 'revolution,' but imperialists are also terrified of it; therefore, we are envied by many people; since starting from Guangdong, our revolutionary army has won every battle; they have seen that there is no way to deal with it, and they have no choice but to join the revolution; and we, due to environmental factors, have allowed them to mix in; now, their true colors as warlords can no longer be concealed, and are being exposed day by day; they do not want the people, do not want revolution, and are directly engaging in warlord behavior, letting the people see it; after we know this, on one hand, there is the National Revolutionary Army, and on the other hand, there are the warlord armies; we will see which one wins in the end; since Yan Xishan assumed the false post, his credibility with the revolution and the people has been completely lost, and he can no longer mix into the revolutionary ranks to carry out his traitorous activities; as for the issue of punishing Yan's rebellion, now all party departments and the general public advocate punishing Yan Xishan; however, in the opinion of the government, there is no need to use troops to punish him; although Yan Xishan's counter-revolutionary behavior has been exposed, his weaknesses are not yet fully apparent; they think this rebellion is a big deal, but we can treat it as a small matter, or even as if it never happened; I believe that in the near future, they themselves will punish themselves; not only will those they consider friendly forces clash with each other, but their subordinates will probably punish them as well; therefore, the government does not need to use troops for the time being; I may go to inspect the Jinpu and Pinghan Railways in a couple of days, but it is not to command troops to punish them; now, the most important thing for us is internal rectification; whether in military, political, or party affairs, we must all work hard ourselves; if we can do this, even without using troops, the reactionary factions will naturally be eliminated; if we do not work hard ourselves, even without reactionary factions, we will still be eliminated; therefore, now we should strive to rectify all aspects of society, politics, and economics; this time in Zhejiang, I saw that the shortcomings we had before, which were unsatisfactory to the general public and feared and envied by the reactionary factions, have not been corrected; there are also many young people who do not know how to achieve the goals of the revolution, and their expectations for the government are too high; the government can never completely accomplish the cause of the revolution in a day; also, I heard that party departments in the countryside do not allow people to visit graves or burn paper ashes; not allowing the burning of paper ashes is appropriate, and no one would encourage the burning of paper ashes; but they should know that there are more than 500,000 people engaged in the business of making paper ashes; if burning paper ashes is prohibited, at least 500,000 people will lose their jobs; it is easy for the government to issue an order, but if many people lose their jobs before a relief method is devised, can the government bear this responsibility? Otherwise, wouldn't it merely create unrest in society? Therefore, many young people are ignorant, and this is just one example; there are many other similar cases; also, the matter of sweeping tombs is a custom that has existed in our country for thousands of years; of course, the government has no order prohibiting it, but the lower-level party departments are ignorant, causing misunderstandings in society;</p>
<p>There was a labor strike at Jardine Matheson the day before yesterday, followed by a student parade; the education sector and the government must take responsibility for this; now the reactionary factions are spreading rumors, even saying that the British killed four Jardine Matheson workers; this is completely untrue; it must be understood that under a revolutionary government, our citizens will not be killed by foreigners without cause; the municipal government and the education department should inform the principals of all schools that if students lightly listen to rumors and become tools for the reactionary factions, and take excessive actions, the government will treat them as counter-revolutionaries; it must be understood that in the era of the counter-revolutionary government in Beijing, it was understandable for young people to feel moved by the revolution; now, under a revolutionary government, acting against the revolution is tantamount to cutting oneself off from the revolution, not only will one be punished, but one will also bear the title of counter-revolutionary, and there will be no leniency;</p>
<p>Therefore, now if any school or organization disobeys government orders and stirs up trouble without cause, the government will severely punish them; now that the reactionary factions are rising up day by day, it is precisely the time for us to work hard and struggle; in the past, Sun Yat-sen was able to consolidate the foundation of the revolution and develop the revolutionary forces in a very small place in Guangdong; now, the territory is much larger than before, and the economic and military strength are superior to what it was before; any reactionary faction can be eliminated; it is hoped that everyone will continue the revolutionary spirit of Sun Yat-sen, consolidate the foundation of the revolution, and not allow the revolutionary cause of Sun Yat-sen's decades to be destroyed by others; as long as we ourselves are sound and the interior is consolidated, no one can be our enemy; the more enemies there are, the brighter and more hopeful our revolutionary future will be; as long as we rectify the interior and work together to build, the reactionary warlords will be eliminated without the need for troops; I will be going out again in a day or two; I hope everyone will pay attention to rectifying the interior, especially the various agencies in the capital, to revitalize their spirits; we do not need to use troops to punish the rebels, sacrificing the lives of soldiers and the property of the people; we are very confident that we will soon be able to eliminate all the reactionary factions and the country will achieve genuine unification; this is what I offer to everyone today."</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence: In recent days, not only is the money market extremely tight in this port, but there is also a severe shortage of silver dollars and banknotes; silver shops dare not conduct transactions due to the lack of cash; therefore, although the Money Industry Association reported to the authorities yesterday, no transactions were made, and they did not even report today; since the silver industry has completely stagnated, all commercial activities are also affected; the most recent reason for this is that the Jinan branch of the Central Bank transported 400,000 silver dollars to Qingdao a few days ago, and the city suddenly felt a lack of silver dollars; also, due to the situation, the Central Bank completely withdrew all banknotes; the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are also afraid of runs, affecting their business, so they are actively redeeming the banknotes they issued; the China Industrial Bank is also redeeming banknotes, withdrawing them but no longer issuing them; the amount of silver dollars in the market is gradually becoming scarce; however, most of the funds of the banks are loaned to various silver shops, and the silver shops then relend them to various local product merchants for business outside the city; the funds are not in Jinan; therefore, although the Bank of China has issued 3.6 million yuan in banknotes, the Bank of Communications has issued 3.1 million yuan, and the China Industrial Bank has issued 50,000 yuan, they are actively redeeming them, but very few are being recovered; knowing this situation, the banks are competing to urge the silver shops to repay their debts; the shops, with no funds on hand, cannot cope; they have been meeting for days to discuss solutions, first requesting the banks not to press for repayment for the time being; the banks refused; then, two methods were proposed: (1) repay the debts owed to the banks in Shanghai to avoid shaking Jinan's cash reserves; (2) ask the banks to transport silver dollars from various places to Jinan to circulate in the market and provide relief; however, it is not profitable to transport silver dollars to Jinan now, and due to the situation, the banks have not agreed to do so; in the past two days, cash is about 5 yuan more expensive per thousand yuan than deposits; it is extremely difficult to find 300 or 200 yuan in cash on the market; the shortage of cash is unprecedented in recent years (April 4-5).</p>

<p>(1) Shanghai vs. Guangdong Match</p>
<p>The soccer skills of the Shanghai and Guangdong teams have long been known. Yesterday was the date of the conference semi-finals, and the two teams played at the soccer field. Those who came to watch reached four or five thousand, packing the stands tightly, almost to capacity. The two teams fought fiercely for ninety minutes. Initially, the Guangdong team was able to maintain, but they became increasingly unable to support as the battle continued. As a result, Shanghai overwhelmingly defeated Guangdong 5-0, winning the right to the soccer finals. The audience unanimously praised them.</p>

<p>The weather was clear yesterday, and from 2:30 PM, even more spectators flocked to the soccer field. The road outside the field was congested, and the ticket office was crowded with people pushing and shoving, eager to get in. Young students were especially numerous, all with a sense of excitement, wanting to see the athletes of both teams display their skills.</p>
<p>As the bell rang three times, the team members of both teams entered the field one after another. After warming up, they lined up against each other. Shanghai defended the north, and Guangdong occupied the south. Both sides moved quickly and performed excellently, charging forward like breaking through bamboo. The beauty of their passes made the audience cheer endlessly. Initially, the strength of the teams was difficult to distinguish, and the situation seemed very even. The Guangdong forwards were very brave, but their shooting skills were too weak, making it difficult to score. Shanghai was strong, but they had to put in all their efforts to achieve victory.</p>
<p>The battle between the two sides was very intense. Sometimes the Shanghai team attacked, and the Guangdong team counterattacked. The Shanghai team maintained their usual standard, and although star players Li Huitang and Chen Zhenhe did not play, their strength was not reduced. Chen Guangyao performed the best for the Guangdong team. The inside defense was also good, but they were often flustered and made mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Kicking from the Ground <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>A few minutes after the match, Guangdong's Chen Guangyao rushed towards the Shanghai team. Jiang Shan Jing returned the attack not far away. At this time, the Shanghai team's goal was empty. Li Ning, without regard for his own safety, kicked the ball from the ground, earning a lot of applause.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Alarming Waves <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Guangdong forwards ran quickly, which was evident to the audience. After ten minutes, Chen Guangyao broke through and went straight to the end line to cross the ball. Four forwards rushed over, creating an uneasy situation in front of the Shanghai team's goal. Fortunately, Xian Yan and Li Ning were able to defend effectively, preventing any ambush.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Strict Inner Defense <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai team was unable to attack, so they changed their strategy and used a five-way encirclement to attack. However, the Guangdong team's inner defense was strict, making it difficult to break through. The more fiercely the Shanghai team attacked, the more vigilant the Guangdong team became. At this time, the Shanghai team could only sigh in vain.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Penalty Kick <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Twenty minutes later, the Shanghai team attacked even more fiercely. The Guangdong goalkeeper made many high saves. At this time, an inside defender was penalized for touching the ball with his hand, resulting in a penalty kick. Dai Linjing took the kick and scored, opening the scoring.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Speed is Essential <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>At the start of the second half, after a few minutes of back-and-forth action, Xi Qiaosheng received the ball and passed it to Dai Linjing. Dai kicked the ball high, and the Guangdong goalkeeper jumped to save it, but the ball went into the net.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Distant Shot <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Soon after, Shanghai's Zhuang Shihong received the ball 30 yards from the goal and shot towards the enemy's goal. The Guangdong goalkeeper parried the ball not far away, and Xi Qiaosheng, waiting for an opportunity, kicked it in, scoring a goal. Then, Wang Yongji scored another goal with the help of Chen Jiaqiu.</p>
<h3 id="e90">The Audience Cheered <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>In the midst of the melee, Dai got the ball and passed it to Chen Jiaqiu. Chen passed it back to Dai, and Dai passed it back to Chen Buyu Tian. Chen intercepted the ball and dribbled it past a defender, advancing rapidly as if he were in an uninhabited area. At the same time, the crowd roared with cheers. Yu Tian became even more inspired, rushing to the edge of the goal and kicking the ball hard into the net.</p>
<h3 id="e91">No Second Chance <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>At this point, the Guangdong team roared, and all their ailments seemed to disappear. Chen Guangyao charged repeatedly, but unfortunately, he was unsuccessful. Soon after, the whistle blew, and the Shanghai team won 5-0.</p>
<h3 id="e92">(2) Nanjing vs. Liaoning Match <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing's strength and courage were superior to the Liaoning team.</p>
<p>They won more easily. The Liaoning team resisted with all their might, but the forwards had several excellent opportunities but failed to score. Unfortunately, their left-wingers He Rongzhang and Liu Baojun were often able to penetrate deep into enemy territory, creating a panic situation, but because the opposing inside defense was too strong, they were unable to achieve success.</p>
<h3 id="e93">One Breath <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>As soon as the two sides started fighting, the Liaoning team launched a full-scale attack. Not long after the start of the game, Nanjing's right winger Jiang Zhihong broke into the siege with great momentum, but was blocked by the Liaoning team's defense and failed to succeed. About a quarter of an hour into the game, the Liaoning center back suddenly got the ball and went over the defender, passing it to Wu Ronghe. Wu forcibly charged forward, with Cai Sicheng covering him on the side. The two advanced side by side, making it difficult for anyone to stop them. When he got close to the ball, Wu Ronghe kicked it, and the ball went into the net from the left corner, opening the scoring. After that, the Liaoning team became more and more courageous. The forwards charged several times and performed very well. The Nanjing team did not want to show weakness and counterattacked strongly. After several passes, the right inside forward Ling Yuanyang shot in a goal to tie the score. The most dangerous moment for the Liaoning team was when the Nanjing team took advantage of the Liaoning team's full-scale attack. The right winger Jiang Zhihong made an excellent pass, and center forward Gu Yuanliang had a good opportunity to shoot from six or seven yards from the goal, but the ball went too far to the side, otherwise the Liaoning team would have no chance. At thirty minutes, Liaoning made another valiant effort. The right inside forward got the ball and shot hard at the goal. The ball hit the crossbar and bounced back. Although the ball did not go in, the goalkeeper was already very nervous. After a period of melee, Liaoning's Cai Sicheng broke through and attacked again, but failed. After that, the attack and defense of both sides gradually became equal, and the situation was very balanced. The result of the first half was a 1-1 tie.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Decline <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>At the start of the second half, the Nanjing team gained momentum. The Liaoning inside defense fought bravely, making it impossible for the other side to have a chance to shoot. After entering, the Liaoning team made a great effort and launched a fierce attack. They had two corner kick opportunities, but they were ineffective. Unexpectedly, while the Nanjing team was trying hard to resist, a long pass led to the Liaoning team's demise. The left winger Liu Zukan shot in a goal. Subsequently, Liaoning also shot in a goal, but it was ruled out for offside.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Exhaustion <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Twenty minutes later, the Nanjing left winger, with the help of Ling Yang, shot in another goal. Soon after, Liaoning also kicked in a goal from the center forward. After entering, Nanjing adopted a more defensive posture, attacking as the opportunity arose. Until the end, there were no more gains. As a result, Nanjing won 3-2.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Aftermath of the Game <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Seeing the failure of the game, many of the Liaoning players swarmed into the field, making a fierce appearance, wanting to hit the umpire. Fortunately, after many people persuaded them, the matter was settled. It has been found that such behavior has become commonplace for the team members in this conference, which is a pity for the conference and a stain on the team. It is hoped that the team leaders will correct this during normal training.</p>

<p>Shanghai vs. Liaoning Game</p>
<p>The Strength of the Two Teams is Equally Matched</p>
<p>But Shanghai Has a Better Grasp of Shooting</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the Shanghai men's team and the Liaoning team held the second game. Shanghai basketball has long been famous, and Liaoning is based on Feng Yong University, with most of the players being former Tianjin Rotary Club players, such as Xian Zhuanghuai, Wu Jiqing, Ma Yu, Hua, etc., who are all Tianjin experts, so their strength is also very impressive. In the first half, the Shanghai team was dominant, with a score of 34 to 15, Shanghai won. In the second half, the Liaoning team gave it their all and changed their tactics, resulting in 29 to 19, Liaoning won. The total result was 53 to 44, Shanghai won, obtaining the right to the semi-finals today. The details of the competition are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Smooth Sailing <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The game started in the first half, and the two sides fought fiercely. There was no record in the first three minutes. In the fourth minute, Shanghai's Liang Guoquan opened the scoring, scoring a goal. Not long after, Liaoning's inside defender Ma Yuhua also scored a goal, making it 2 to 2. After one minute, Huang Yunli and Wang Jinpeng each scored a goal, making the score 8 to 2. Seeing that Shanghai was unstoppable, the Liaoning team immediately announced a timeout and replaced Wu Jiqing with Ma Bingjun as center forward. But since then, Shanghai has been smooth sailing, and the score has continued to rise. The Liaoning team's shots seem to be inaccurate. Although their cooperation is very good, they lost too many opportunities to no avail. The first half ended with a score of 34 to 15.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Final Struggle <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>As the whistle blew, the second half began. The Shanghai team replaced He Tong with Wei Haiqing as center forward. The Liaoning team had the determination to fight to the death and fought very fiercely. They also changed their strategy, attacking from a distance and attacking from close range, which was always beneficial. In the first ten minutes, they created a record of 15 to 5, with a total score of 39 to 30, Shanghai won, with a difference of only nine points. So Shanghai announced a timeout, and He Tong entered the field for the second time. The Shanghai team seemed to regain its previous courage, and He Tong also scored several goals in a row. Finally, the score in the second half was 29 to 19, Liaoning won, and the total score was 53 to 44, Shanghai won. In terms of the strength of the two teams, there is little difference, but Shanghai seems to have a better grasp of the shots.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Semifinal Results: Shanghai and Guangdong Secure Spots in Finals</p>
<p>Championship Outcome to Be Decided Tomorrow</p>
<p>Guangdong Defeats Beiping A...Two Sets to Zero</p>
<p>Guangdong Team Excels in Offense and Defense</p>
<p>Beiping Team Lacks Coordination</p>
<p>After Guangdong and Beiping A Team Two successively defeated Shanghai B and Liaoning on the 4th, each obtained a semifinal qualification. At 1 PM on the 7th, the two teams competed in the volleyball court. The Guangdong team's players were well-rounded, with excellent coordination among the front, middle, and back rows. The Beiping lineup was also quite strong, but they lacked experience, and the initial formation was scattered. In the second set, they displayed a surprising performance, not discouraged by the loss, and their spirit was commendable. A brief account of the match follows:</p>
<p>At 1 PM, the female players from the North and South gracefully entered the court. Both teams were full of spirit and dressed neatly, especially the Guangdong team in white shirts and shorts, all with bare legs, resembling young boys, and their lively demeanor and exquisite posture indicated they were skilled players. As the game began, both teams vigorously attacked, but the Beiping formation was disorganized, with many mistakes. Guangdong, on the other hand, had a smooth start, scoring fourteen consecutive points. As a result, the Beiping team's morale was further shaken. Despite repeated efforts to compete, the score difference was too large to overcome. However, the situation gradually evened out, with progress on both sides. Before long, Guangdong won the first set 21-6.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Starting with the second set, Beiping aimed to counterattack, with a very strong sense of unity. The front row's offense was quite effective, and the scores remained close. Although Guangdong initially took the lead at 11-9, Beiping made even greater efforts after that, engaging in a fierce battle for a long time, with the score suddenly increasing to 17-14, turning defeat into victory. Seeing the enemy's momentum, Guangdong also agreed to work together to cope, and their offensive and defensive methods were very appropriate. The performance at this time was very exciting, a sudden highlight compared to the previous sets. The outcome of each ball often involved ten or eight exchanges, with blocking and spiking, each team displaying its skills. One could only see hands weaving and palms extending above the net, with the ball rolling back and forth, making for a spectacular sight. Sometimes, even if the ball was hit out of the court, they could still use long-range passing to escape danger. The audience applauded and cheered loudly. In an instant, Beiping was still leading at 18-14. Then, Guangdong scored on a serve, resulting in a 19-19 tie. Subsequently, each team scored 20. At this critical juncture, the competition became even more intense, as the opportunity was fleeting, not allowing for the slightest delay. In the end, Guangdong gained the lead with a successful serve, winning two more points to win. Winning two consecutive sets, they secured the right to the final.</p>
<p>Judging from the teams' talent in today's match, Guangdong was more well-rounded. Beiping had many good players, but the skills of one or two were slightly weaker, resulting in a lack of coordination. Peng Jingbo in the middle row made the most mistakes. If this player had made greater efforts in the second set, they could have taken the lead earlier, and the outcome of the third set would have been uncertain. From this, it can be seen that the excellence of a team does not rely on a few exceptional talents, but rather on the effectiveness of coordination. Referee: Xu Minhui.

<p>In Women's Volleyball, Shanghai A defeated Tianjin to win the finals. In the second match on the 5th, Tianjin defeated Zhejiang, and Shanghai A defeated Hubei, each securing the semifinal qualification. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, the two teams held a semifinal match, watched by over two thousand spectators. Shanghai A's excellent skills were already well-known, while Tianjin's performance in the previous victory over Zhejiang was also quite impressive. In terms of strength, Shanghai was stronger because Tianjin was located in the North and had fewer opportunities to compete, lacking experience. Observing their performance, the formation was disorganized, and coordination was inflexible, almost resulting in a complete defeat. In the second set, Tianjin rallied, and the situation suddenly changed, once holding a great advantage with a score of 12-8. Unfortunately, they were repeatedly pressured by the opponent afterward, and their defense was ineffective, leading to another defeat. In the first set, Shanghai won 12-2, and in the second set, they won 21-18. Shanghai secured the right to the final and will compete with Guangdong on the 9th in the final match to determine the championship.</p>

<p>Ye Chucang Talks About Sports</p>
<p>Both Serious and Humorous, the Audience Chuckles</p>
<p>Yesterday (7th), the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters held an expanded commemorative week. Following speeches by Dai Jitao and He Yingqin, Ye Chucang spoke at length about sports. The following is a record of his speech: "These days, it's okay not to mention Hangzhou, but once you mention Hangzhou, you have to talk about the National Games, how bustling and lively they are. Twenty years ago, I was also an athlete. At that time, the high jump used two boards with a stick placed on them. According to the level of English, there were three groups competing. As a result, Group A won, and Group B didn't even smile at them for three weeks. At that time, promoting sports actually caused a lot of negative feelings. In this conference, the newspaper records say that a certain province is better than another province, and a certain province is not as good as another province, which is not good. The province is just an organizational name, which is convenient for administration. It does not divide the people of the country into several boundaries. This conference is not a competition between one person and another, nor is it a competition between one province and another. The purpose is to create new records and hope that the next conference will be better than the previous one. This is an important meaning. I remember Mr. Dai once said in a speech that people are old when they reach fifty. This sentence means that the physical fitness of the current people is not as good as that of the predecessors, because the ancients were considered old at seventy or eighty. If this continues, maybe they will be called Liaohus basketball battle Wang Kai photography</p>
<p>Old at thirty, so the purpose of this conference is to hope that the physical fitness of the people and the physical fitness of the nation will be strengthened due to the promotion of the conference. "When Ye spoke, he was both serious and humorous, which made the audience very interested and smiled from time to time.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters held an expanded commemorative week at 9:00 a.m. today, and invited central committee members to attend and give speeches. At the same time, the Zhejiang Party Headquarters also believed that all the Liaoning athletes had a deep belief and understanding of the party's doctrine, but due to geographical reasons, they rarely heard the opinions of the central committee members. Therefore, taking this opportunity, they urged all the Liaoning team athletes to attend.</p>

A certain gentleman replied with a humorous attitude, "Please ask your conscience, have I ever photographed it and not sent it to you?" The lady replied with a smile, and those who like to flirt satirized it, saying that the four words "conscience" added material to the odds and ends.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Explanation of the National Education Improvement Program <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>(1) The guiding principles for the compilation of this program are: For compulsory education and adult literacy supplementary education, the focus is on popularization within a limited time; for secondary education, the focus is not on rapid promotion, but on qualitative improvement first, and high schools should especially adopt a centralized approach; for higher education, the focus is on consolidation and improvement, rather than increasing the number; other social education, overseas Chinese education, and Mongolian-Tibetan education should take into account needs and national financial resources, compromise and average, and strive to be appropriate and practical.</p>
<p>(2) This program is divided into ten chapters, and the main items are as follows:</p>
<p>Chapter 1 Preliminary Plan for Implementing Compulsory Education</p>
<p>Chapter 2 Preliminary Plan for Implementing Adult Supplementary Education</p>
<p>Chapter 3 Plan for Establishing Teacher Training Institutions at All Levels and Types</p>
<p>Chapter 4 Plan for Improving Elementary Education</p>
<p>Chapter 5 Plan for Improving Secondary Education</p>
<p>Chapter 6 Plan for Improving Higher Education</p>
<p>Chapter 7 Plan for Improving Social Education</p>
<p>Chapter 8 Plan for Improving Overseas Chinese Education</p>
<p>Chapter 9 Plan for Implementing Mongolian-Tibetan Education</p>
<p>Chapter 10 Total Budget for the Whole Program</p>
<p>(3) Unless otherwise specified in the text regarding special cities, other matters not specified shall be handled in accordance with the methods for each province in the text. (4) In the total budget, in addition to the central government expenditures, only the total amounts for each province and each county and city are listed each year. During implementation, each province and each county and city should determine the annual budget for each provincial government and each county and city separately, taking into account the circumstances.</p>
<p>(5) This program only lists the budget, and there are no plans for raising funds, because the source of funds is a financial program, which should be calculated by the financial authorities after the education program is decided, and a separate plan should be formulated for implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Preliminary Plan for Implementing Compulsory Education, Chapter 1 <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>(1) Goals</p>
<p>The goal of this plan is to provide four years of primary education to all school-age children nationwide. However, for poor children in rural or urban areas, adjustments (Note 1) or shortening (Note 2) of their schooling period may be considered, with supplementary schools (Note 3) or a "self-study system" (Note 4) to supplement their required compulsory education.</p>
<p>(2) Timeframe</p>
<p>It is planned to complete the establishment of national teacher training institutions within five years, and at the same time, to initiate 1,500 compulsory education experimental zones in urban and rural areas (Note 5), so that all important counties across the country can begin small-scale experiments in compulsory education. Subsequently, it will be promoted year by year, and by the end of the twentieth year, a uniform four-year compulsory education will be implemented nationwide.</p>
<p>(3) Problems that Urgently Need to Be Solved</p>
<p>A. How to ensure that all school-age children nationwide enroll in school. To implement four years of compulsory education, based on a ratio of one-tenth of the population, there should be 43 million school-age children nationwide (Note 6). Excluding the students who are already enrolled in school (Note 7), there are still 37 million people without the opportunity to receive education. In addition, with the natural population increase over the next twenty years, the number of school-age children will increase by at least 3 million, totaling 40 million people. Of these 40 million school-age children, according to the distribution of urban and rural populations, urban areas account for about 15 percent, and rural areas account for about 85 percent. The primary problem at present is how to ensure that all 40 million children enroll in school.</p>
<p>B. How to train the required teachers. Assuming that each teacher is responsible for educating an average of 40 students (Note 8), then the country needs to increase the number of teachers by one million. However, teachers cannot serve in primary schools for life. Assuming that one-fifth are replaced every five years, then eight-tenths of the teachers will be replaced in twenty years. At the beginning, the number of teachers is too small, and the length of service cannot but be extended. Assuming that the number of replacements is reduced by half, then among the one million teachers, 400,000 will be replaced in twenty years. Therefore, 1.4 million teachers must be trained in twenty years to meet the need. The second problem that urgently needs to be solved at present is how to train 1.4 million teachers in twenty years.</p>
<p>C. How to increase the required school buildings and equipment in the classrooms. Assuming that each classroom can accommodate about 40 people (Note 9), then the country needs to add one million classrooms and one million sets of classroom equipment. Some people suggest that schools adopt the Gray System, with each classroom accommodating two classes of students, which would reduce the number of classrooms. However, in reality, the Gray System can only be implemented in industrialized and commercially developed cities with concentrated populations. If the Gray System is used in sparsely populated rural areas with inconvenient transportation, it would reduce the number of students in each class, not only failing to save classrooms but also increasing the number of teachers, which would be uneconomical. The number of students in cities only accounts for 15 percent of the total. Even if all primary schools in cities adopt the Gray System, it would only reduce the number of classrooms by about 7 percent. However, after the Gray System is implemented, school classrooms can no longer be used to conduct adult supplementary education, making it difficult to serve as a center for social reform (Social Center). Therefore, saving 7 percent of the classrooms is actually a loss. Therefore, this plan still intends to add one million classrooms. However, how to raise huge sums of money to build so many classrooms and add the necessary equipment in the classrooms is the third problem that urgently needs to be solved at present.</p>
<p>D. How to raise the required funds. For each child enrolled in school, the government</p>
<p>must bear at least seven yuan per year (Note 10). To enroll 40 million children, the annual expenditure needs to be increased by 280 million yuan, excluding the money needed to build classrooms and train teachers (Note 11). How to raise this large sum of money and how the central and local governments should share the cost of compulsory education are the most important problems that need to be solved at present.</p>
<p>(4) Methods of Training Teachers and Enrolling Students in Stages</p>
<p>First, of the 1.4 million teachers needed to implement compulsory education, 15 percent will serve in urban primary schools, about 200,000 people. They can be trained by existing normal schools and normal departments of high schools in cities. The remaining 85 percent will serve in rural primary schools, about 1.2 million people. They should be trained by rural normal schools established in each county.</p>
<p>Second, the teachers of urban normal schools will be trained by existing normal universities or education schools of various universities, as well as colleges and specialized departments within universities that are related to teacher training.</p>
<p>Third, the teachers of county-level rural normal schools will be trained by provincial-level rural normal colleges and rural normal specialized departments (hereinafter referred to as specialized departments).</p>
<p>Fourth, the teachers of provincial-level rural normal colleges and specialized departments will be trained by the National Compulsory Education College.</p>

<p>Fifth, county-level rural normal schools will be established separately in large counties or jointly in upper-level counties. A total of 1,500 schools will be fully established within five years. The 1.2 million rural primary school teachers needed will be trained by these 1,500 normal schools. On average, each school must train 800 teachers. From the sixth year onwards, each school should have an average of 53 graduates per year. These normal schools recruit graduates from higher primary schools and train them for three years (this is the minimum, see Article 11). During these three years, there will inevitably be many dropouts. Approximately 120 students are needed to produce 53 graduates to serve as rural primary school teachers. As a transitional measure at present, private school teachers should be recruited and trained to meet the immediate needs. On average, 200 people should be trained each year by the county-level rural normal schools.</p>
<p>Sixth, each county-level rural normal school should train 120 students at a time and have at least 10 teachers. The 1,500 normal schools will need a total of 15,000 teachers. Among these 15,000 people, one-fifth will be replaced every five years, accounting for six-tenths in fifteen years. However, since not many schools will be established at the beginning, the number of teachers replaced can also be reduced. Therefore, in fifteen years, only about four-tenths of the teachers will actually need to be replaced. To supplement these replaced teachers, 6,000 more teachers must be trained, totaling 21,000 people, to ensure that the county-level normal schools do not feel a shortage of teachers.</p>
<p>Seventh, to train these 21,000 people, 27 rural normal schools and specialized departments must be specially established in various provinces, each training an average of 777 people. Among them, 15,000 people must be successfully trained before the end of the fourth year so that the county-level normal schools in various provinces can be fully established at the beginning of the fifth year. From the second year to the fourth year, 5,000 people must be trained each year. Each of the 27 provinces must train an average of 180 people each year, totaling 540 people in three years.</p>
<p>Eighth, the 540 teachers needed for provincial-level rural normal colleges and specialized departments will be trained by the National Compulsory Education College, training 270 people each year for two years. Afterwards, 100 people must continue to be trained each year to fill vacancies and improve their level.</p>
<p>Ninth, the National Compulsory Education College and experimental zones will be established in the first year. First, university graduates will be recruited and trained for one year, and then they will be assigned to various provinces to serve as teachers in rural normal colleges and rural normal specialized departments. They can also serve as compulsory education administrators in various provinces. The central compulsory education experimental zones should be divided into two locations, one in the city and one in the countryside, for the students of the college to conduct field experiments and serve as the foundation for promoting compulsory education nationwide.</p>
<p>Tenth, the rural normal colleges and rural normal specialized departments specially established in various provinces, as well as the provincial compulsory education experimental zones, should be opened at the beginning of the second year. The college recruits students who have completed the second year of university and gives them two terms of training. In the first term, they study at the school for one year and are then sent to various rural normal schools to serve as teachers. After serving for two years, they return to the school to study for another year, and are awarded a bachelor's degree, allowing them to serve as principals, teachers, and educational administrators in rural normal schools.</p>
<p>The rural normal specialized department is set up in the provincial rural normal college, recruits high school graduates, trains them for one year, gives them a certificate of completion, and sends them to serve as teachers and staff in central primary schools, members of rural education committees, or assistant teachers in rural normal schools. Afterwards, they must enroll in school for research every summer vacation. After completing three summer vacations, they can be awarded a diploma from the rural normal specialized department. The compulsory education experimental zones in various provinces should also be divided into urban and rural areas for students to practice and serve as the foundation for promoting compulsory education throughout the province.</p>
<p>Eleventh, the county or county-jointly established rural normal schools will be opened in three phases. From the third, fourth, and fifth years, one-third of them will be established separately. A total of 500 county-level normal schools and 500 urban and rural compulsory education experimental zones will be added nationwide each year from the third year to the fifth year.</p>
<p>County-level rural normal schools recruit junior high school graduates, study for two years, and send them to serve as teachers in rural primary schools. Afterwards, they must enroll in school every summer vacation. After completing three summer vacations, they are given a rural normal school diploma and are allowed to serve as teachers in central schools and educational administrators in various rural areas.</p>
<p>Rural normal schools can also recruit graduates from higher primary schools who are over 15 years old, study for three years, and send them to serve as assistant teachers in various rural primary schools. After serving for two years and completing two summer school sessions, they return to the school to study for one year, and then return to service to serve as rural primary school teachers. After another two years and completing two summer vacations, they can be awarded a formal normal school or high school normal department diploma and a central primary school teacher's license.</p>
<p>Twelfth, by the end of the fifth year, compulsory education teacher training institutions and compulsory education experimental zones in various provinces and cities will be widely established. From the sixth year onwards, together with existing provincial normal schools and newly established county-level rural normal schools, 90,000 teachers will be trained each year. After deducting 15,000 retired teachers, the net increase in teachers each year is 75,000. In this way, 75,000 new primary school classes can be added to educate 3 million children. By the eighteenth year, primary schools can be widely established throughout the country. By the twentieth year, a four-year compulsory education can be fully implemented nationwide.</p>
<p>In addition to running teacher training institutions at all levels, the following matters must be carried out:</p>
<p>A. Register all graduates of normal schools and normal training courses in the province, and advise them to go to various primary schools to serve. All normal school graduates who do not have jobs shall be assigned to various counties by the education department to serve as primary school teachers.</p>
<p>B. Strictly implement the service regulations for normal school graduates. Those who have received normal education must serve in primary schools for three to five years.</p>
<p>C. All teachers who have not graduated from formal normal schools shall be re-examined, and those who have qualified academic knowledge and experience shall be hired separately to make up for the shortage of teachers, and regulations on teacher summer vacation training shall be formulated and strictly implemented so that their academic knowledge can be improved at any time.</p>
<p>D. Primary school teachers who fail the examination shall be sent to the county-level rural normal schools for one or two years of training.</p>
<p>E. Examine private school teachers. Those who pass the examination shall be temporarily appointed as rural primary school teachers, and shall receive supplementary normal education during the summer vacation. Private school teachers who fail the examination shall be advised to attend county-level rural normal schools for more than two years of training.</p>
<p>(5) Ways to Increase Classrooms</p>
<p>To implement compulsory education, the country needs to add one million classrooms. The country has 1,915 counties, and each county needs to add an average of more than 500 classrooms. At present, there are financial difficulties, and local areas may not be able to build them specifically, so the following methods have to be adopted:</p>
<p>A. Use the family temples of the people across the country. The Chinese people are rich in family concepts, and the first family often has a family temple (or ancestral hall). The government can borrow a part of the family temple to run primary schools and at the same time bear the responsibility of repairing the family temple. Both sides have mutual benefits, and the people should welcome it. B. Use academic palaces, academies, and other common places. This matter has already been implemented in most places. There should be no opposition to using academic palaces, academies, and other places to run primary schools. C. Use all temples and monasteries. All temples and monasteries should allocate a part to the government to run primary schools. This is different from confiscating temple property, and it has fewer malpractices than monks and Taoists running primary schools themselves.</p>
<p>D. Encourage private donations of houses or donations to build school buildings. The villas built by the rich are often closed all year round, only for the accommodation of two or three caretakers. If they can donate or lend a part to run primary schools, it will be of great benefit to the government. The government should encourage and promote it, and give appropriate rewards. As for donating money to build school buildings, special rewards should be given.</p>
<p>E. The government should raise funds to build a kind of school building that is extremely economical and durable, and set a standard for simple and practical equipment for various places</p>
<p>to adopt. A part of the subsidies allocated by the central government and the national treasury should be used as the cost of building school buildings.</p>
<p>Roughly estimated, it costs at least 200 yuan to convert an old-style house into a classroom, and various equipment needed in each classroom also costs about 300 yuan. Therefore, each class costs a total of 500 yuan to open (to be continued).</p>

<p>Zhang Weihan Visits Wang Zhengting Yesterday to Bid Farewell</p>
<p>The Sino-French-Vietnamese trade agreement was negotiated last month by Hu Shize, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, while he was visiting his relatives in Ping Province. The opinions of both parties were quite consistent, and it seemed that there was a possibility of signing the agreement. Unexpectedly, Minister Fromet de Rosnay recently made excuses for delay, first by claiming that he had not received a reply from the French government, and then by using the rampant bandits in Longzhou, Nanning, China, and the detention of the French Consul in Nanning, M. Gaillard, by bandits as reasons for delay. The signing of the entire agreement is indefinitely postponed. Zhang Weihan, the special commissioner of our side participating in the revision of the agreement, went to the Foreign Affairs Discussion Committee on Shanzhong Road at 10 am yesterday to bid farewell to Foreign Minister Wang and decided to return to Yunnan on the 15th of this month. He will go to Beijing again once the signing is scheduled, it is said.</p>

<p>Rice Prices Fall Again Yesterday</p>
<p>The rice market has been tense for several days. Since the Social Bureau severely cracked down on it, merchants who are blinded by greed have been wary and dare not engage in monopolistic behavior again. Therefore, the arrival of goods has improved day by day, and prices have gradually fallen. Yesterday, the price of Sutong White Rice in Nanshi fell back to 17.7 yuan, but no one paid attention. Songjiang Thin Rice opened at 17.5 yuan, and Liantang Thin Rice was at 17.12 yuan. Sales were also sluggish. The price of foreign rice remained firm due to the large number of exports, and it was difficult to fall back for a while. Yesterday, Saigon No. 1 opened at 15.2 yuan, and Xiaojiao was at 14.6 yuan. The buying sentiment in Beishi also subsided because most importers were watching the market fall. Yesterday, there were about 200 rice boats under the river. Due to the price limit of 18 yuan, travelers, innkeepers, and all parties were waiting and watching. And the stock of the shops is enough to meet sales for more than half a month, so there is no need to rush to buy. In general, the rice market in the north and south has eased, and prices will not rise, it is said.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Finance Department Subsidizes 2,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The salaries of the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau police were in arrears for almost three months, and the food for the police was cut off. After County Governor Leng and Bureau Chief Shen went to the province several times to negotiate and urge allocation, the Jiangsu Finance Department considered that the county's public security funds were indeed difficult, so it first subsidized 2,000 yuan from the provincial funds, and then discussed fundamental solutions. Yesterday, the Shanghai County Government was notified by telegram, and County Governor Leng ordered the Finance Bureau to allocate and distribute the funds to reassure the police.</p>

<p>Must Not Exceed Authority and Violate the Law</p>
<p>Must Not Be Influenced by Officialdom</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, which stated that it had been learned that the heads and deputies of townships and towns in various counties often interfered in local civil and criminal litigation, and even issued tickets to summon people, hold court hearings, and arbitrarily impose large fines. They used notices and instructions for the people. Such illegal acts are detrimental to the progress of autonomy. It must be known that the heads and deputies of townships and towns are local autonomous personnel and are responsible for representing the provincial government to guide the people. They are completely different from the former clerks and gentry, so they must not exceed their authority and violate the law, and even more must not be influenced by officialdom. It is hereby ordered that the county governor shall comply with this order. If the heads and deputies of townships and towns commit the aforementioned acts again in the future, once reported, the district directors shall be allowed to investigate and report, and they will be severely punished without any leniency. County Governor Leng ordered all district directors to comply with the order yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Post Office Receives Xiamen Xinye's Telegram of Thanks P] <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Regarding overseas Chinese residing in the South Seas Islands, whose letters sent through the People's Affairs Bureau had their postage reduced by order of the Ministry of Transportation, charged at five cents per twenty grams, the postal authorities have already telegraphed the British postal service and instructed the commissioners in Shantou and Xiamen to comply. Xiamen Xinye, benefiting from this preferential treatment, sent a telegram to express gratitude. It is said that the postal authorities, after receiving the telegram, have already forwarded the situation to the Ministry of Transportation. "Respectful greetings to the Director-General of Posts, from Commissioner Lin Zhuowu, we learned that your telegram reduced postage to five cents per letter, showing consideration for overseas Chinese and colleagues in the Xinye industry. We hereby express our gratitude and request you to convey our thanks to the Minister. Xiamen Xinye bows in respect, Branch."</p>
<p>Amendment to the Chamber of Commerce Law Approved by the Ministry</p>
<p>Executive and Supervisory Committee Member Quota Not Approved for Increase</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce previously stated that the number of executive and supervisory committee members stipulated by the Chamber of Commerce Law was too small to be sufficient for official duties, and submitted a request to the Ministry of Commerce for amendment. Now, approval No. 9157 from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has been received, acknowledging the presentation. Regarding point one in the presentation, concerning the number of executive committee members, the Chamber of Commerce Law does not adopt a sectoral representation system for executive and supervisory committee members. Their mission is to develop the overall interests with a unified force, which is different from the old Chamber of Commerce's board of directors system. Regarding point two, concerning the relationship between industrial and commercial guilds and the Chamber of Commerce, the industrial and commercial guilds are important components of the Chamber of Commerce. In principle, the Chamber of Commerce is generated by the guilds, so the Chamber does not adopt a Chamber of Commerce certification system. This matter concerns changing the legislative principle, and the requested forwarding is difficult to approve. According to the presentation, it should be noted accordingly.</p>

<p>Yangtze River Shipping News</p>
<p>Jiujiang Martial Law Reduces Cargo and Passengers. With the Communist Party rising up in Jiangxi Province, Jiujiang has declared martial law. Cargo from Jiangxi to Shanghai is mostly loaded onto ships from Xunpu, but since this month, no one dares to load cargo. Dockworkers have also stopped working together, resulting in a significant decrease in cargo from Jiujiang on downstream ships on the Yangtze River in recent days. Even passengers do not dare to take Chinese merchant ships east. Yesterday, when a Chinese merchant ship arrived in Shanghai, there were only five passengers from Jiujiang. It is said that commerce on the Nanxun Road has been halted by banditry, and people in Xunpu have been slightly more stable since the third day, but shipments from Shanghai, except for salt, have all decreased.</p>
<p>The Strike Wave is Gradually Expanding.</p>
<p>After the strike wave at the Chongqing Lingjiang Guild, foreign ships are still insisting. The loading and unloading guild in Yichang has demanded an increase in wages and has proposed conditions that each piece of cargo, regardless of loading or unloading, originally paid 150 cash, should be increased to 300 cash from April. The reason is that copper coins are extremely cheap in Yichang, with each yuan falling to 4,600-4,700 cash. The shipping companies say that the cost of labor in Yichang is already high, with loading and unloading fees costing 40 taels of silver per hundred tons of cargo, which is three times more than the 14 taels per hundred tons in Shanghai. If it is increased again, it will become 80 taels per hundred tons. Therefore, the foreign merchants have agreed to refuse, and the barge and dock gangs in the port have risen up to support the loading and unloading gang, and the strike wave is expanding. Yesterday, the Shanghai shipping industry received a telegram from Yichang saying that the shipping industry union has come forward to mediate, hoping to avoid disrupting transportation. The results are still unknown. The Yichang Municipal Party Department has taken advantage of the suspension of foreign ships to pressure Chinese Lingjiang, and has issued a declaration to quickly recover the navigation rights of the Sichuan River.</p>

<p>Recent Events of the 26th Regiment of the 5th Division</p>

<p>Zhou Shida, commander of the 26th Regiment of the 5th Division stationed in Shanghai, is extremely serious about training his soldiers. Therefore, after months of reorganization in Shanghai, the results have been remarkable. The regiment's military equipment was already very sufficient, and now it has received hundreds of new guns from the division headquarters. A test firing was conducted at Longhua Airport yesterday. Recently, due to the high cost of living in Shanghai, Commander Zhou personally leads the soldiers to open vegetable gardens in the open space of the old barracks on Xieshi Road, planting various vegetables, which is a small supplement to the national food supply and shows meticulous care for the soldiers.</p>

<p>National Goods Association Requests Reduced Tax Rate on Zhongshan Ge</p>
<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association requested the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to reduce the tax rate on Zhongshan Ge, stating, "We have recently received a letter from the Shengjing Silk Industry Association, a member of our association, stating that the Zhongshan Ge silk produced by our industry has recently been valued and taxed by the Shanghai Customs, amounting to as much as 18 or 19 taels of silver per load, which is higher than the tax rate on any other type of silk. As a result, sales have plummeted and business is difficult. In addition to our association submitting a request to the Ministry of Finance and Industry and Commerce to reduce the export tax on Zhongshan Ge, we specifically request your association to grant maintenance and provide sympathetic assistance to maintain national goods. We are deeply grateful, etc." According to this, we have learned that the Zhongshan Ge in question is made entirely of rayon and cotton, with no real silk mixed in. It is a purely imitation product. Since its launch, it has not only been able to slightly resist the invasion of foreign silk, but also supports the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of industrial and commercial people. National and economic interests benefit. It is noted that the export tax of the Customs stipulates that silk and rayon interweaves, or silk and cotton interweaves, are subject to a unified tax of only five taels and five qian of silver per load, while this Zhongshan Ge is purely a rayon and cotton interweave. Although the goods appear beautiful, the cost is very low. It should be taxed at half the rate to comply with tax regulations. Even if we take a step back and tax it at the rate of five taels and five qian, merchants already feel that the burden is too heavy and sales are difficult. However, the Jianghai Customs regards it as a new product and arbitrarily increases the tax, sometimes without standards, raising the valuation, resulting in a tax payment exceeding the cost by as much as 18 or 19 taels per load. As the tax rate increases, the cost naturally increases, coupled with the layering of fees and demands from officials, what crime have merchants committed to suffer such poisoning? It is no wonder that foreign goods are taxed once and sold everywhere, flooding the country, leaking hundreds of millions, and exhausting the country and impoverishing the people. Now that our National Government is recovering tariff autonomy and implementing it, the actions of the Customs have a great impact. Moreover, at a time when the national silk industry is declining, we should be united, work hard to promote it, reduce the tax amount, and expand foreign sales, so that we can save the industry and prevent leaks. Our association is based on the future of national goods, so we dare to report on the situation on its behalf, and we implore your department to order the Jianghai Customs to reduce the tax rate on this item and not exceed the tax rate of five taels and five qian per load of silk and rayon or cotton interweaves. We implore you to understand the difficulties and allow the promotion of sales, so as to maintain national goods and protect industry and commerce. We cannot bear the urgency to wait for orders. Standing Committee Members of the China National Goods Maintenance Association, Wang Jiean, Wang Xingyi, and Wang Hanqiang, kowtow together.</p>

<p>Xie Baosheng's Son Escapes from Bandit Boat in Sanhuangni Creek</p>
<p>---A Total of Eleven People Have Been Captured---</p>
<p>Distant Relatives Come to Shanghai, Offering Diligence</p>
<p>Negotiations Reveal Flaws</p>
<p>Xie Baosheng Personally Takes Action</p>
<p>Rescuing His Beloved Son, Not Avoiding Hardship</p>
<p>On the evening of the 22nd of last month, the home of Li Mingzhai at No. 817 Qunshou Lane, White Rock Road, was burgled by armed robbers. Ornaments worth thousands of dollars were stolen, and his seven-year-old nephew, Xie Songtao, was kidnapped. Xie is the young son of Xie Baosheng, the current comprador of the China Merchants Bureau's Xinming Steamship. Details have already been recorded in this newspaper. It is now heard that the hostage, Xie Songtao, was released yesterday morning after being detained on the bandit boat for about seventeen days. The details of the kidnappers' contact and the cracking of the case obtained by this newspaper are recorded in sections below.</p>
<p>The Kidnappers Pretend to Visit</p>
<p>Since Xie Songtao was kidnapped, his biological mother, Li, has been extremely worried. Having a pearl snatched from her palm, she is heartbroken all day long. His father, Baosheng, is alert and once served as the captain of the detective team of the former Public Security Bureau. He paid attention to the clues of the case early on. However, the bandits did not make any contact or send any letters. Besides strict investigation, there was little chance of cracking the case. Unexpectedly, on the 30th of last month, a distant relative of Li, Peng Yuansheng, from Yancheng, who is forty-four years old, came, claiming to inquire about the kidnapping. In his words, he emphasized that contact must be made as soon as possible to get the pearl back. Li did not notice and, thinking he had good intentions, entrusted him with the task of contact.</p>
<p>Entrusting Someone to Negotiate in Changzhou</p>
<p>Xie Li was anxious to get her son back as soon as possible. Therefore, Peng Yuansheng came to her home the next day. Considering that he was a distant relative from the same hometown and willing to take on this arduous task, she was overjoyed. She did not know that Peng was one of the bandits. He claimed that the hostage was hidden in the Changzhou area based on reports from his friends. Xie's intention was not to make secret contact. However, now that Peng Yuansheng had come, there must be clues. Moreover, since he was a fellow townsman who had not been in contact this year, she was quite suspicious. Therefore, she paid him six silver dollars and asked him to go to Changzhou. If the bandits had a flexible solution, it would be best. Otherwise, she would publish a statement in the newspaper, not pursuing the matter further.</p>
<p>Flaws Revealed in the Letter</p>
<p>After receiving the commission from Xie's house, Peng Yuansheng went to Changzhou to negotiate the ransom. Unexpectedly, he did not return for several days. Xie thought that it would only take a day to travel back and forth between Changzhou and Shanghai. Why did Peng Yuansheng not come back after going? There must be other circumstances. Until the morning of April, a letter came from the bandits, with an overbearing tone, demanding 50,000 yuan and requiring the money to be paid within five days, otherwise the hostage would be killed. Xie ignored it because there was no contact address. However, on the same afternoon, another letter came from the bandits with a similar tone, but they forbade publishing in the newspaper, saying that even millions in cash would not be accepted if such an announcement was published. Xie thought that only three people knew about the newspaper publication. Now that the kidnappers were using this to threaten her, Peng Yuansheng's suspicion became more apparent.</p>
<p>The Principal Interrogates the Origin of the Weapons</p>
<p>At noon on the fifth day, Peng Yuansheng, who was said to have gone to Changzhou for talks, suddenly arrived. After meeting with Li, he talked a lot about how hard he worked in Changzhou, but he was detained by bandits at No. 3 Changxing Hotel in Changzhou for a disagreement. Li learned of this and, because this was a big matter, she informed the old house at No. 5 Fufu Lane, Edward Road, by telephone, instructing Xie Baosheng to come in person. After Xie received the call, he drove there. Seeing Peng's unusual expression, he questioned him in every possible way. Peng was uneasy. However, Xie was a well-known figure in the exploration area. Seeing this situation, he was about to report the arrest. It happened that the special investigators of the General Patrol House had received a secret report, saying that contacting the bandits was suspected of being a major crime. Therefore, they sent Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Peng Yuansheng at the address.</p>
<p>Five People Captured at Night</p>
<p>The Chinese and Western detectives of the General Investigation Department of the General Patrol House brought Peng Yuansheng back to the patrol house, believing that he was highly suspicious. After strict interrogation, Peng began to admit that he was the same party as the kidnappers. The detectives then took Peng to the address at No. 239 Luban Road, French Concession, to point out the arrest. They arrested Yang Denge and Yang Xuesheng, two people from Jiangbei. They also sent several detectives to stay in the house. At ten o'clock that night, the bandit gang Zhang Wansheng, Feng Yuanxue, and Li Ganquan returned to their nest from outside and were also captured. A total of five people were arrested. Yang Denge then confessed that Peng Yuansheng instructed him to prepare a small boat for moving, but he did not expect to kidnap the hostage. He did not know. The detectives asked where the boat was parked. Yang said that it was near the Damu Bridge in Rihui Port.</p>
<p>Strict Inspection of Ships in the Port</p>
<p>After obtaining the confession, the detectives of the Patrol House used an official document to submit it to Yuan Liang, the Director of the Shanghai Special City Public Security Bureau, because the hostage was hidden in the Chinese界. After hearing the news, Yuan immediately ordered Xu Jishi, the captain of the Water Patrol Team, to supervise Patrol Officer Li Chenghua, Patrol Leader Wu Minshen, Detective Liu Changrui, Ma Ruyun, Zhang Yuting, Yang Chunting, Jiang Linquan, etc., to meet with the Chinese and Western detectives of the Public Concession Patrol House and the victim Xie Baosheng, each with flashlights, guns, and weapons. They secretly went to the Suzhou River, Rihui Port, and Hongqiao area to check the parked ships. The detectives searched strictly for half a day, but there were no results. Fortunately, a tip came that a boat was parked in Huangni Creek, Qibao Town, Qingpu County, which was very suspicious.</p>
<p>The Hostage Bandit Ship Was Discovered</p>
<p>Until about 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, at a distance of nine miles from Qibao Town, a place called Huangni Creek, on the north side of the river, a small northeastern boat was found parked there. However, after inspecting the boat, there was a foul smell everywhere, making people want to vomit. Captain Xu and the detectives of the Patrol House immediately boarded the ship to conduct an inspection. In the front cabin of the ship, they saw two men sleeping soundly with their flashlights. A child was lying naked between the two men. At that time, Xie Baosheng identified the child under the light as his beloved son Songtao, who had been kidnapped for more than ten days and had not escaped. He was overjoyed on the spot. The detectives each held their guns and monitored the situation, preventing any accidents. Xie immediately embraced his son, but the child's body was very dirty and emaci</p>
<h3 id="e147">Telegram Regarding Reduction of Overseas Chinese Postal Rates <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Overseas Chinese Associations, the National Federation of Commerce and Industry, and other groups telegraphed to various overseas Chinese organizations in Singapore yesterday, stating that the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, various organizations in Singapore petitioning for reduced overseas Chinese postal rates, the Overseas Chinese Congress, the Shantou General Chamber of Commerce, the Shantou Wholesale Association, the Xiamen General Chamber of Commerce, and the Xiamen Wholesale Association, all noted that the Ministry of Communications, Postal Administration, had initiated the cancellation of Overseas Chinese private postal agencies and increased postal rates. Our associations and others repeatedly telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Communications, and the Construction Commission, requesting that the responsible officials of the Ministry of Communications be dismissed and that a nationwide announcement be made to all countries, so that overseas Chinese mail would continue to be charged according to the original rates for an indefinite extension. After the implementation of the Universal Postal Convention, we received a letter from the Government Secretariat stating that the Ministry of Communications had replied, according to a report from the Postal Administration, after receiving a telegram from the Kuala Lumpur Postal Administration, stating that the Kuala Lumpur Postal Administration had not declared to overseas Chinese representatives that this case was initiated by the Chinese government, etc. We telegraphed the government again, pointing out that the Postal Administration did not inquire with the Singapore government, but instead inquired with the Kuala Lumpur post office, which was clearly an attempt to evade the truth, and requested that the postal rate increase be cancelled. We also organized a joint conference to fight for the overseas Chinese postal rate increase, and elected Chen Zhiying, Xu Jigong, Chen Chunan, Zheng Qizhong, Lin Jingqian, Zhu Xiajiu, and Zhuo Wuchu as seven general representatives to handle this matter. At the second meeting on April 4th, we also invited Lin Shi, the general manager of the Postal Administration, to attend the meeting to explain the process. On that day, General Affairs Section Chief Yu Xianglin and Committee Member Xu Yingsan were sent by General Manager Lin to report that a telegram had been received from the Ministry of Communications, approving a reduction in postal rates for domestic mail to Southeast Asia to five cents per twenty grams, and a public letter was enclosed stating that the request from your association to ban Overseas Chinese private postal agencies was approved, and a telegram should be sent to the Shantou and Xiamen post offices to postpone implementation. After investigating this case, it was found that it was a request from the British Malaya Kuala Lumpur post office and the handling of the situation by our office had been communicated previously. Later, a letter was received from the British post office, stating that it would be implemented after March 31st according to Universal Postal Convention rates. Due to the urgency of the situation, we were concerned that our national postal agencies' general packages to Southeast Asia would be penalized for not complying with Universal Postal Convention rates, so we telegraphed the British post office to extend the deadline and reported to the ministry for instructions. We then received a reply by telegram from the British Malaya Kuala Lumpur post office, stating that private postal agency mail from China to Southeast Asia before May 1st would not be treated as underpaid mail. Now, we have received another telegram from the Ministry of Communications stating that the British post office requests an increase in fees for mail from private postal agencies in Southeast Asia. After repeated appeals from overseas Chinese organizations, the Ministry, understanding the situation and knowing that overseas Chinese are facing genuine difficulties, decided to make appropriate accommodations in consideration of the feelings of overseas Chinese. In the future, mail sent from private postal agencies to British Malaya should be charged five cents per letter per twenty grams to show consideration and comfort to overseas Chinese. The British Malaya post office has already been contacted for serious consultation and decision. Based on current market prices, five cents in Chinese silver currency is less than three cents in the currency commonly used in the British Malaya islands. It can be seen here that the Chinese government is sympathetic to the difficulties of overseas Chinese. We will report further after receiving a reply telegram, and we are sending this letter to inform you for your reference. After investigating, our associations originally intended to firmly request the cancellation of the postal rate increase plan, but since the five cents per letter postage for domestic mail and six cents per letter postage for foreign mail were requested by Mr. Li Weinan, Chairman of the Singapore Overseas Chinese Congress, it was not appropriate to argue too much. According to the above-mentioned letter, we are sending this telegram to inform you for your reference. Furthermore, since private postal agencies do not comply with the Universal Postal Convention, the national Postal Administration has established special rules for postal consignment agencies, charging two yuan for the signboard and one yuan per year for the license. This does not violate the Universal Postal Convention and can provide convenience for private postal agencies. General Affairs Section Chief Yu requested to be informed of these details. We also request the Shantou and Xiamen General Chambers of Commerce to inform the Wholesale Associations to follow suit. The rules for special postal consignment agencies are attached. Sincerely, the National Federation of Overseas Chinese Associations, the National Federation of Commerce and Industry, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Promotion Association, Jinan University, the Southeast Asia Cultural Department, and the Southeast Asia Students Association.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Popularity of Woolen Fabrics on This Street <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Diminished Interest from Customer Groups</p>
<p>Recently, stores selling woolen goods, new clothing stores, and hat and shoe workshops on this street have shown strong interest in woolen fabrics. As the weather warms, actual sales are starting to pick up, and small-scale retail transactions have also suddenly increased. There is continued demand for serge, worsted, fancy suiting, flannel, summer fabrics, etc., and wholesale orders are being placed for both individual pieces and entire boxes. Blue continues to be the popular color for serge. Only Shui Mei's Dujian brand of raincoat fabric continues to be popular, with the Ningfeng, Xinji, Rongtai, and Taili brands all selling for three taels and five qian and a half. Recently, customer groups have shown less interest, especially those from the north. Currently, only the large and small Sichuan customer groups still have demand. Other small inland customer groups also have a decent business in piecemeal wholesale and selling by the piece.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Silk and Tea: Weakening Old Cocoons <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Total Shanghai Factory Customers Under 40,000</p>
<p>No Improvement in Silk Sales by Foreign Firms: The Qingming Festival has passed, and farmers in the interior are all preparing to incubate silkworm eggs. Last year's silkworm cocoon harvest was poor, and there was already a shortage for reeling. The stock of old cocoons in Shanghai warehouses is becoming increasingly scarce. Due to the current unrest, the existing cocoons in the Yangtze River area are all being loaded onto ships and transported to Shanghai to be sold while the opportunity exists. However, the quantity is limited. An investigation shows that the total number of cocoons held by various foreign firms and factories, together with the newly transported cocoons from Anhui and Hubei, is less than 40,000 bales. If all the silk factories in Shanghai were to resume operations, it would still be difficult to sustain production. Yesterday, silk sales by foreign firms in Shanghai showed no improvement. The foreign exchange rate was unstable, and telegrams were quiet. Only Dachang and others imported 40 bales of Shanghai white factory silk, Xin Shichang and others imported 15 bales of Qian Da silk, and Kechang imported 9 bales of coarse yellow silk. Prices remain firm.</p>

<p>French nails are thriving. Previously, the trade in French nails was pessimistic because the nails could be exported with a complete exemption from half the tax, which caused an unusually pessimistic trend and gave the market an outwardly strong but inwardly weak appearance. In recent days, according to news from the customs authorities, exports are no longer permitted, so the business of imported goods is flourishing. The number of forward contracts being unloaded is increasing. As a result, market prices are rising steadily. Currently, ordinary patterns can be opened to six taels and six qian, and better patterns are priced at six taels and seven or eight qian. According to a tea party investigation, a total of two or three thousand barrels were loaded for export yesterday, and another 2,500 barrels are awaiting shipment to Wuhan today.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Japanese Doll Festival <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>March 3rd is the Japanese girls' Doll Festival, called "Hina Matsuri" in Japanese. Families with daughters must clean and decorate a room on this day, setting up an altar covered with silk and brocade, and placing foreign dolls on it, so that their lovely daughters can offer cakes and worship. This year, it was held again as usual, creating a lively atmosphere. It is also known as the Peach Blossom Festival because it falls during the sunny weather when peach blossoms are in full bloom.</p>
<h3 id="e157">The Story of the Doll Festival <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Legend has it that in a village in ancient China, there were three beautiful and intelligent young women who suddenly passed away on March 3rd. People considered this day unlucky for girls, so they began to make dolls and throw them into the turbid river on that day, hoping that the dolls would carry away the bad luck of the daughters. This practice does not seem to be heard of or practiced in our country, but it has been a traditional custom in Japan for over a thousand years. However, the rituals are slightly different, and the practice of throwing them into the turbid river is not adopted.</p>
<h3 id="e158">The Doll Festival in the Palace <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Emperor has two princesses, Princess Teru and Princess Taka. This year, American girls raised funds to purchase hundreds of dolls for the two princesses to celebrate the festival and to strengthen the friendly feelings between the girls of the two countries. At the same time, Dr. Sheltner's book "Loving Dolls" was sent to the noble girls. Therefore, this year's festival was especially joyous. On this day, the palace was decorated extremely luxuriously and magnificently. The four walls were hung with silk and brocade depicting the above-mentioned story. The palace pillars were adorned with fresh flowers, and the fragrance was intoxicating. Thousands of silver lamps were placed on the ground. A large altar was set up in the center, covered with scarlet brocade. Sandalwood was burning on it. There were seven levels, and dolls were placed on them. Some wore ancient clothing, some were dressed fashionably, some were beautiful women with captivating eyes, some were heroic and awe-inspiring, and others were grotesque or had large bellies. Some were reaching out their hands as if begging, and some were naked and performing celestial devil dances. All kinds of dolls were available, making it difficult to describe them all. At 11:00 a.m., Princess Teru and Princess Taka attended the ceremony. Elegant music led the way, followed by lanterns. Princess Taka was young and could not walk on her own, so she was carried by a servant. Emperor Showa led the noble women to stand on the side of the hall to watch the ceremony. The Empress assisted Princess Teru in offering cakes, candies, and mochi (a type of Japanese cake), and offered wine three times, bowing and paying respects. The music in both corridors began to play, and palace maids danced with colored silks on the hall. The Empress carried the two princesses down, and the ceremony was completed. In the afternoon, the Emperor hosted a banquet to wish the two princesses good fortune. A joyful atmosphere filled the palace.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Doll Festival Among the People <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>On this day, every household in the country celebrates, with Tokyo being the most grand. In addition to private celebrations, there are also public celebrations. Hibiya Park and the competition ground are decorated in the most luxurious way. There is a doll exhibition and a doll theater. In the afternoon, schoolgirls perform various plays about dolls, as well as sing and dance. Over a thousand girls attend, and they all receive candies and other gifts, enjoying themselves immensely. At night, the Osaka Radio Station broadcasts a speech by Japanese artist Nishizawa, titled "The Literary Doll Festival," and a performance of "The Story of the Doll" by Ms. Ota to entertain girls throughout the country.

<h3 id="e160">70,000 Danish Children Commemorate Andersen <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales are world-famous. Almost every country with written language has a translation of Andersen's fairy tales. April 2nd is the 125th anniversary of his birth. Over 70,000 Danish children have come together to commemorate this great poet.</p>
<p>Their method of commemoration is to choose the most interesting scenes from Andersen's fairy tales and dress up as described in the stories and parade on the streets. At that time, many residents and shops in Copenhagen (the capital of Denmark) raised flags to express their respect and enthusiasm for Andersen. These many innocent and cheerful children marched to the City Hall, where the mayor gave them a sincere speech. After the performance, everyone sang the national anthem and dispersed excitedly. This was the joy of the elementary school students. Some of the older students performed plays in schools, and some sang at home. That kind of festive atmosphere was more enthusiastic than any gathering. This also shows the appeal of Andersen's fairy tales. (By Mo)</p>
