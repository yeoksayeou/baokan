<p>自總理誕生以來迄於今日已六十四年於茲矣今日爲總理誕辰設今日而無總理之誕生則我華同胞或尚被壓迫於滿淸專制政府之下國已不國民已不民不知伊於胡底矣是故今日之日其値得我人之慶祝固不言而喻矣回憶總理畢生精力盡瘁於革命工作奔走四十年經十次之失敗而志不少餒以先知覺後知先覺覺後覺而我人得以洞悉淸政府之腐敗帝國主義之可畏羣起革命民國始得成立</p>
<p>今日之日我人袛知爲總理誕辰而不知亦爲國恥之期中日之戰老大中華竟敗於蕞爾東劉之手於是我國虚弱完全曝露各國見日本得獲不少利益乃大倡其門户開放利益均沾主義咸來攫取種種權利先是俄國以脅回遼東有功又援前例向我國索地爲酬淸政府不敢拒絶派李鴻章使俄許俄在東三省有鐵路敷設權及礦山開採權並租膠州灣爲軍港不料事爲德人所悉借山東曹州地方殺德敎士爲名突將軍艦開至膠州灣强迫租借以九十九年爲期並取得膠濟鐵路建設權及沿路百里内之礦山權俄兒膠灣爲德所佔於是與我國改訂新約强租旅順大連以二十五年爲期英人倡言平均海權索租威海衛租期如旅大法人效法法德人以兵艦開入廣州灣强迫租借租期如膠州灣英人見之又藉口均勢索租香港對岸之地以擴充舊佔之九龍租期亦如廣州灣自是以後要港盡被外人租借國防從此不得完固矣</p>

<p>今春兩省政府奉令設計後即各由建設廳積極籌備擬定大體計劃分别遣派測量隊預測路線以便估計經費經數月之努力將路線測定經費擬定後又復行派員正式測定路線計環湖共長八百餘里除太湖西南角自蘇之宜興至浙之吳興約三百里已有京杭路告成可不必另築外尚須築五百餘里此五百餘里在蘇省逹四百里浙省僅百里耳蓋蘇省自宜無至吳江南境與浙接壤處沿湖無縣道之築成均須從頭做起故工程浩大浙省則以京杭路之沿湖段逹二百餘里故其工程僅及蘇之四分之一矣路之闊度現定爲三十英尺將來視需要再行增闊此兩省工程之大槪情形也</p>
<p>路線經過蘇省曾費躊躇綠錫宜省道雖未興築而當王前建廳長時路線早經測定惟爾時尚無環湖大道之議故所經各地並不純臨太湖茲爲便於環湖路計乃變更路線使近太湖庶此路一舉而得兩利自無錫起則由黿頭渚經管社山·五里湖·南方泉·華大房莊·新安鎭·望亭沿東太湖入蘇州境再經光福·木凟·吳縣城·平望·震澤·而至浙之南潯過此由南潯至吳興屬諸浙省路線亦早測定矣</p>
<p>築路經費蘇省估計至少須二百萬元蓋路線旣長而無錫吳江間小道縱横土基旣難塡橋樑涵洞需費尤鉅也省庫貧乏無可籌措爰就發行之建設公債中列入一百九十七萬五千元爲是路之建築費已呈請國府核准矣浙省之百餘里所需約四十萬籌劃尚較易也</p>
<p>最近之工作進行兩省建廳以此路實感需要須早實現路線前雖測定現爲精確計又各派公路局測量人員再往依照前線覆測備一切就緖之後俟經費撥下即可實行興工無少阻碍矣</p>

<p>— 志政</p>
<p>社會時尚多汽缸　有多至十六只者　汽車製造界丕變</p>
<p>當本年夏季的時候汽車界中忽然有一個狠令人可異的謠言這謠言是開笛立克汽車公司今年决計不再造十二只和十六汽缸車了汽車週刊社得到這個消息以後馬上去訪問公司經理對於這件事的意見他當時笑着回記者説［這些話祗要看未來的事實便可證明］屈指至今離開夏季又是幾個月而開魯克的多缸車依然還在那裏造而謠言終於由熱烈而冷淡由泠淡而沈寂了</p>
<p>因爲這件事汽車週刊社便聯想起關於這問題的種種觀察社會上何以要造成這種謠言無疑地一定以爲這件事的重要啊本刊很願以十二分的誠意將今後汽缸數量問題作一深切的研討供讀者的參考</p>
<p>根據本刊的意見多缸汽車（指八缸以上的）在過去七年間不能發展有兩重原因而多缸汽車在今後非但不至停造並且要目趨重要的理由也有兩端過去七年内大家對高價列車多半是認爲奢侈品購用的還是極小數多缸車是屬于高價列的自然銷行起來要受着影響第二從前的多缸車機器方面還没有逹到完善之域何以演呢譬如車行起來因爲汽缸多須生出許多暄聲來一方面維持費用又於其可驚大宗貪圖便宜暨省事起見不顧來買多缸車這是根據事實而得到的二個結論爲什麽又説多缸車在最近的將來要發呢理由也不多兩點第一點是因爲社會人士對於八缸車及其他表示歡迎根據社會心理的變換大家都捨樂四缸六缸而競争在八缺十二缺上面汽車是一種營業如普通衣飾的一般想賺錢所以制勝之道先要迎合社會心理社會心理趨重於多缺車上尤其是八缺所以製造家也祗有跟着跑第二點是高價車因爲進步較緩非利用多缺不能取勝理由是這樣的近幾年來汽車界中差不多完全是低價車勢力範圍低價車天天嚷着改良結果因爲没命的競争低價車漸漸得到高價車的所有優點這樣一來高價車却慌了爲了保持優越地位和低價車競争起見非另闢途徑不少否則可以説是完全爲低價車取而代之了於是他們便想到多缸制一層低價車是不能逹到的便專心在這上面去努力同時社會人心爲著低價車坐得膩了又想到多缸車上去這樣一來汽車界又生出一個突然的轉機</p>
<p>談到八缸的歷史也狠有趣味八缸車產生於一九一五年那時這有兩公司製造翌年陡增到十二家一九一七年又增了兩家一九一八年因爲營業衰落歐戰又起所以减至十三家到了一九一九年以後更是一落千丈祗勝了七八家一九二一年升到十一家一九二二年又加兩家一九二三年無變動二四年又减最可觀的是一九二八年從十四家一躍而至十九翌年又升至二十二所以狠有扶搖直上的意味到今年已逹二十七公司的最高數一九一五年的八缸創始者是値得叙述的這便是開笛立克和派卡公司而在此期間派卡公司首先創造了十二只汽缸車接着便是開笛立克公司</p>
<p>現在大家都對於多缸車感覺到濃厚的興趣但是我們要問究竟汽缸多了是否用費也要加多這個問題在從前的答覆是正面在現在答來却是反面因爲現在的多缸汽車製造時比以前改良多多他們第一件注意的便是費用問題因爲這個難關不打破就不能和低價車争勝所以現在我們可以説多缸車的費用不比任何低價車高汽車油消耗量不必説就是以後修理費也不因爲汽缸多而多所折耗多汽缸車旣然有這些好處外加他能生出偉大的力量迅捷的行駛所以便打處受人歡迎而十二缸車十六缸車都使人感着興奮不過照我們的眼光看來十六只汽缸還没有到需用的時候一來美國道路律很嚴對於車輛速率常有限制每小時不得過若干里所以即使有了巨大速率的汽車也終是英雄無用武之地不能生效而且速率即使能快到了相當程度以上便有流弊譬如肇禍的最大原因即基於速率問題十年以前汽車最高速率爲每小時七十里平常祗用着三十里現在呢每小時可行一百里然而用到的祗是四十五里所以汽車雖然能快終究難於用到所以多缸車而用十六只汽缸除却作爲一種時尚外一時恐怕還用不到</p>
<p>從上面看來可以知道多缸車在過去七年間雖然失敗然而現在却又恢復了非但恢復並且大宗對它感着濃厚的興趣而有［多汽缸狂］（Multipld　Cyliner　Craze)的傾向理由不外因爲一來人心變更一來内部改良美國人好奇心是全球最顯著的自從這次心理更變以後多缸車的製造一定要十分發展不過以本刊記者的眼光看來汽缸多至八只汽缸最爲適用十二只十六只都無甚用處可是汽車公司儘管迎合社會人士心理到了</p>

<p>— 克家</p>
<p>茲據本埠東大陸銀公司統計所載今年上半年内所有舊汽車零躉押欵均超過去年營業數目在此百業不景氣時代而有此進步殊可喜也</p>
<p>先是數年前本埠汽車行初行分期付欵制時人皆測其必無良好之結果其時各專家對此項制度之利益及其於金融上之影響議論紛紜莫衷一是以美國爲尤甚蓋在一九二五年美國每年銷路已逹美金五、○○○、○○○、○○○元之譜也</p>
<p>查反對分期付欵制者之意見每曰汽車也家庭各種省力機器也新裝也無線電也以及種種家具等銷路已闢有新巿塲决非舊日分期付欵制所能應付需要者</p>
<p>贊成者曰不然因大宗出品能提高工資工資旣高即有分期付欵之能力自分期付欵制盛行於是大宗出品之機器遂工作不息矣以上輾轉成一循環但一般批評家仍多未信之</p>
<p>一九二五年紐約花旗銀行公報曾登載反對分期付欵制之言論其他如密歇根省之Senator　Lames　Couzens亦竭力非議之</p>
<p>但至一九三○年紐約花旗銀行八月份公報因鑒於分期付欵之制歷經風險安如磐石其論調一變如下</p>
<p>其言曰［目下雖不能確論此項制度之最後結果因不景氣時期之久暫吳此制大有關係但一般人預測此制之糾紛實有言過其實之處又查今日各大銀公司之紀綠類皆受惠匪淺</p>
<p>［據銀行報告美國所有諸領袖汽車銀公司之紀綠咸證明此項分期付欵制如循執而行在經濟制度上决無留一弱點之理］</p>

<p>新别克直綫八缸汽車輪華以後即受各界熱烈之歡迎今世界各地均有新别克之輪轍各國人士無不表示同樣熱誠之歡迎實現通用汽車公司之標語［凡優美之汽車惟别克能造之］</p>
<p>新别克之成功基礎發於開始據克利時瓦云（上海通用汽車公司經理）新車製造以前各處定貨之價額已逾一萬五千萬美金並非虚説蓋每年新樣出世前老别克車主均已預定一輛俾得逐年替換享受新車之滋味今年之别克大加改良汽缸八只油温限制器雙方炭化器雙用進氣制聲器與空氣潔净器齒輪同時相合之傳動法均爲三年來改造之特色且爲汽車界人士所致誠歡迎之緣由也</p>
<p>成功於優秀之建築二十六年來别克之成功史亦懸於此迄今造成之别克汽車已逹二百六十萬輛之多今仍在全球駛者亦尚有一百五十萬輛據調查所得百分之八十八之别克老車主現所購置者仍爲新别克汽車每年之銷數亦佔各種汽車之一半</p>
<p>别克車廠所造之汽車不以車主爲試騐品亦爲其成功之一大緣因更爲使車主欣滿之要點别克每有機械改良或新發明均經從長訽愼考慮先期澈底試騐是以新别克汽車之問世已有三年之實地試騐與精密研究</p>

<p>— 阿魯</p>
<p>大約是星期三罷我們校裏的愛國佈告板上貼着一張白紙黑字藍印的童字佈告</p>
<p>［今夜童軍舉行露營下午三時須全體集合於大操塲以備檢閲……</p>
<p>童軍們得了這道命令在上午就換上了戒裝三時還没有到操塲上已佈滿了黄色的兵士們在平時一個都是體態娉婷媛的的姑娘們今天一變而爲氣象軒昂精神抖擻的八太爺呌的呌跳的跳使棍的使棍弄斧的弄斧她們的一舉一動簡直和兵士一樣誰還認得她們是小姐呢</p>
<p>大約三時到了宏亮的鐘聲嘡嘡的聲了二十多下黄圑長一吹哨子童軍們立刻一字兒的向南排着這時喏大的操塲上除了樹梢上括過風　的簡直一點點兒聲息也没有地　　　童軍總　令張忠仁先生來檢閲好似軍士們等着他們上級軍官來檢閲一樣的肅静張先生由孫先生伴着剛在走上操塲待閲的小卒們一齊舉着棍兒致敬</p>
<p>檢閲完了由黄圑長發令到指定的營地紥營一切的用品都要她們携带着力氣大一點的倒還不生問題可憐一般没有氣力的小姐們個個弄得上氣不接下氣的喘着她們雖然覺得吃力可是没有一個肯落後個個努力的工作没有半點鐘四個大營完全紥好了於是取水的取水洗菜的洗菜燒飯的燒飯燒菜的燒菜一件一件的工作都分配得十分淸楚甚而至於ＷＣ也有一部份人去預備的飯菜預備好了大家蓆地而坐的吃着小菜雖然不佳可是她們爲興趣所趨不但不嫌菜飯的惡劣反而覺得有趣在平時兩碗吃不下的今天却要吃得三碗四碗在平時吃三四碗的今天也不必説了</p>
<p>素來無人到的西園今天然忽然變了熱閙的中心童軍們固然新佔領了這片荒土就是其餘一般小姐們也都來随喜滑稽的面對着一般來參觀的同學們大聲的喝着［軍營重地閑人莫入］可是她這一來竟引起了幾個好動的小姐的動機她們不約而同的奮勇向前把西的帽子糧袋等等完全奪走了後來茜向她們賠了幾回罪才取回了被奪的東西</p>
<p>露營最有趣的是盗營可是她們最怕的也是盗營所以在營的前後都設着防禦的工作此次方發露營的命令的時候有許多人要想盗營可是看她們防禦的周密大家便存着畏宿之心結果實行的祗有兩位</p>
<p>十二點鐘後小姐們都倦了一個一個鑽到營帳裏去做她們上戰塲·衝鋒殺敵的奇夢誰還想得有人家在來偷東西呢］郁小姐她年齡雖小可是她的胆却不小在昏黑的黑夜一獨自走進她們的營地進行她的盗營工作郁小姐雖不是盗賊出身可是盗賊的智識却很豐富在没有走進她們營地的時候先做了一會狗呌再抛了把沙泥見裏面没有什麽反動便輕脚輕手的進去盗了四五件東西安安心心的回去</p>
<p>先來的郁小姐得了勝利可是後來的孫先生便大吃其虧孫先生不但無郁小姐的細心並且還缺乏做賊的常識他是上穿了響底的皮鞋手裏還拿一個五百尺的電筒電筒扳開了還没有什麽問題可是他一雙聲的皮鞋在未踏進營地的時候已先鷙酲了幾人她們看着電光明知盗營的來　却不聲不響的位　了全營士卒等待孫先生進營地正想取物的當兒西邊一營的士卒們早已把他圑圑圍住警笛一吹其他的三營個個都出來了此時的孫先生在數十個電筒光線之下倒也弄得無法可施黄圑長一面着人把先生看守一面去檢點東西結果知道少了四件東西走來逼着孫先生交還原物這時孫先生大呼寃枉可是一般士卒們不管他寃枉不寃枉總是不住的逼他交出原物幸而黄圑長明察把彈孫先生從輕發落放走了</p>
<h3 id="c226">勞大男女生爭居 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 有文</p>
<p>江灣勞動大學的校舍原是以前的模範工廠因爲創立時短建築事艱所以男女生的宿舍都就舊有的工廠房屋修改充用缺點甚多同學們自然都不願長安居的了尤其是女同學的宿舍每間容居十餘人人跡囂雜更加覺得不大方便</p>
<p>本年秋間建造了一所壯麗精美的新宿舍但是僅可以容居一百人左右工學院社會科學院的同學於新屋尚未落成之前就開始爭　新屋所屬主的問題丁而一部份女同學也就很早暗中向學校　局活動允將新宿舍東首樓底下之</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>半作爲女生居住所聞於這事學校當局並不曾明白的指定或宣告不過後樓底下中間那堵高牆的表示大家於無形中都承認這是女同學的宿舍罷了因爲宿舍分配處置之不易又値學校本身之多難當局者就没有工夫來計劃這件事一所新新的而爲萬目共瞩一的新宿舍就一直被鐵將軍封鎖到現在</p>
<p>事眞出乎意料前天晚上約在九點鐘之後工學院的幾位同學突然議决舉行搶屋運動新屋破門之後只見搬箱子的拿被頭的運的風聲鶴淚疾走如飛大有如回祿之夜的恐怖情景一會兒所有的新房間都被捷足者佔得滿滿的了事由工學院的同學發動吃虧的當然是社會學院的同學了因爲得到消息較遲出馬已太晚大部份的只得向隅然而就有一些不甘心的向隅者於氣憤之餘便不管三七二十一侵入東首樓下女同學的區域之内去了他們房門上貼上名片舖好了牀位倒頭一睡便儼然新房間的主人了</p>
<p>當然的囉女同學得了這個風息以後都憤怒得不過氣來她們眞認這是蹂躏女權蔑視女同學的野蠻舉動非起來抗争不可因此第二天一早便有幾個較勇敢的女同學乘着男同學好夢方酣的時候突然破門入内撕碎房門上名片搬進自已的箱子網籃等物件將男同學的撇在一角表示請男同學滚蛋的意思於是争居問題便這樣發生了</p>
<p>雙方經了很久的辯論終不能解决雙方的立論都有似是而非的理由女同學説［這明明是經學校當局承認女生宿舍不然爲什麽中間築那堵墻而且一般都承認男女同學是應分開居的有什麽理由可混入我們的宿舍呢］男同學也就舉出三點來反駁説［第一學校當局並不曾明白指定或宣告這是女生宿舍中間築起的那堵墻並不一定是男女分隔的標幟使着我們男生的舊宿舍不是也有隔牆的嗎（社會學院與工學院的隔牆）第二根據機會均等的原則在昨晚種那情勢之下凡是勞大同學的一份子都有搶新屋的機會而其得失却應歸咎自已的手腕女生與男生同是勞大同學之一分子耳第三而且勞大是一個站在時代之前的革命化的學校過去素無男女生的界限的做工上課吃飯一向混雜在一起居住又何必例外呢］</p>
<p>這種辯論當然不會有好結果雖然在後來較爲温文的男女同學願各自引退而雙方的主力軍終未肯罷兵因此就成功了男女生雜居的局面了胆量大些的女同學竟不顧男同學的四面楚歌勇敢地一個人或二三個人一房間住下來了聞説其中尤以大無畏女士爲最難能可貴她竟抱着她素有的大無畏精神單刀獨馬（一個人居一房間）深陷重圍抵抗有方盛氣始終不餒這樣就成爲勞大目前的居住懸案</p>
<p>此事發生以後引動不少校外的好事者來參觀有壤的亦有好的批評不過本校的指導課方面終以爲這是不大方便的而且日久滋事對於學校名譽也不好聽遂責令男同學自動罷兵引退但是男同學却提出一個條件就是將所有佔居新宿舍的同學令一齊退出再用抽簽的方法確定各人的房間有無他們才允退出女生宿舍可是這件事就很困難的了</p>
<p>於無可奈何文中指導課只得出一告示認此次擅自移居新宿舍者爲一槪無效至於分配問題俟新校長到校後再從新計劃但是男女雜居現在依舊是事實</p>

<p>階叚舞台與表現派監督愛斯勒爾</p>
<p>愛斯勒爾是國立劇塲的舞台監督他的舞台和萊因哈德愛用的柔軟的色彩與抒情詩風童話風的舞台是相反的他愛用直線和强烈的色彩來表現出一種明確的單純在他手裏新創一種莎氏比亞劇的舞台裝置用階叚去支配那莎翁劇特有的複雜的塲面因此在現在人一説到他就想到那階段的舞台最近從他手裏把愛底肯特的［地靈］攝成影戲在第三幕裏他照例擺了許多階叚進去</p>
<p>在［李查得三世］一劇裏暗黑的舞台上佈滿了紅色的階叚［阿色雜］（Othelo）寢室一塲在暗黑的大舞台的正中垂着白幔的帳與寢床左方置有白色的燭台這就是白衣的黑人主人公的寢台這寢台是由四叚的階段造成的這舞台全體很能得到一種黑與白單純的趣味是很令人感服的裝置他這種獨創的式樣在莎士比亞的軍隊劇或羣衆劇裏可以得一種非常的效果兵隊的頭盔或旗仗在階段下動着兩三個古代的武士從階上上升或下降很有一種表現羣衆的力量廻非用許多無秩序的羣衆來表現那種戇法子可比</p>
<p>最能代表愛斯勒爾裝置的傑作是愛底肯特的［佛豐開特伯爵］的舞台面在一間園着白色屏風的室子裏很細的直線的四脚的椅子全是黑色的登塲人物的服裝也全是黑色的男的主衣式肩頭上是鋭角從腰以下是三角形女的衣式却全是直線的顔色除黑和白外只有那頭上的髪是燦眼的黄金色俳優的動作也全都取的直線的動作這劇的某一塲中聽得見園游會的音樂這是把表現派繪畫拿來音樂化的音樂令人起一種看見表現派畫名家柏衣斯泰因繪畫的感情</p>
<p>從來他以推薦無名作家的脚本上演的目的用［年靑的舞台］的名義做第二次公演劇目是［惡魔以上的人］和這内容一致演出方法上是完全的表現主義</p>
<p>表現派舞台的產色是他中間漂着的藝衛的香味表現派演劇這樣成了功愛斯勒爾的單純也這樣成了功這也是愛斯勒爾爲名字與表現派演劇一齋不朽的原因</p>
<p>德國劇壇的脚本難</p>
<p>到哈忍克勒菲兒的［殺人］和開賽的［兩個奥利娃］寂寞地點綴着表現派劇壇的時候德國劇壇上一時找不出比較出色的東西雖然有憑着［年靑的舞台］發展着的［布龍冷］［布來得］和［卓别麟］的作者菲西兒與［醉船］的作者宅琪與雕刻家巴爾拉哇這些年靑人但並没有給劇壇一個甚麽新的進展就是那［羣集人間］可尊的作者枉勒雖然出了獄但也只寫着詩没有見他有劇壇上的活動</p>
<p>近幾年來外國脚本倒在德國劇壇上猖狂起來最先得意的是皮籃得羅他領導了他自已的劇圑到德國來一時使全德國風靖他的作品常常在十個以上的地方出演［誠實爲歡樂］演了三十一個地方［人與動物與德行］演了十五個地方［六人找尋一個作者］的作品名字在德國成了流行的熟語有名的劇評家開兩慨難於德國作家之不振特别作了一篇文章標題呌［六千萬人找尋一個作者］以寄感慨六千萬恰是德國人口的總數</p>
<p>接着皮籃得羅的是蕭伯納再次是奥尼兒除掉這些英·美·意作家的作品外取材於東方的中國劇倒成了劇壇的流行物古拉本特作的［灰蘭記］由萊因哈德之手演於［德意志劇塲］後來在各都巿都演過萊因哈德對中國劇感趣味是他自來浪曼主義趣味的持續不純粹是他的異國趣味他在復活莫查得呌［綠笛］的音樂舞踊劇的時候就在舞台上取了許多中國漆器上的圖畫樣式［灰蘭記］算是他對中國趣味第二次的作品了這劇中的女主脚就是那演蕭伯訥脚本才成了名的白枯萊兒這劇的舞台有許多地方模仿了日本的歌舞伎劇像用鮮艷的桃花與赤色的短機與廣袖來表現東方趣味這都不是中國的而是日本的並且在舞台的提燈上寫着［御神燈］的大字却是日本神社裏用的燈了這是萊因哈德弄錯了的地方</p>
<p>［灰蘭記］的中國劇外還有皮爾西的［洞羅］與歌劇［李太白］神聖之鴨］等但都没有［灰蘭記］那樣哀婉這難怪［灰蘭記］會在德國那樣流行</p>
<p>在德國作家這樣不振的聲浪中間表現了少年成名的克洛斯曼他是老作家湯麥斯曼的兒子他的［阿尼亞與愛斯黛兒］在漢布克上演時兩個女主角一個是愛底肯特的遺女瑪麥拉一個就是湯麥斯曼的女兒作者的妹子愛麗加這作家的血族演劇倒成了當時很惹人興味的事</p>
<p>［六千萬人找尋一個作者］被開爾這樣警示着的德意志劇壇將不會永遠這樣寂寞的罷（素）</p>

<p>— 林鏞</p>
<p>東京通信</p>
<p>這是値得我們注意的事</p>
<p>是在休息時間我也把畫筆放下了在很短的時間内只好跑到閲報室去找昨天宣佈了將要發表的新聞果然一段很注目的新聞使我注目了的確這段新聞是値得我們注目的</p>
<p>這是日本在野美術圑體最高權威的二科會牠爆裂了二科會爆裂是二科會一頁悲史是日本美術界一點光芒因爲那爆射出來的部是二科會裏面的重要畫家是日本畫壇的急進勇將</p>
<p>二科會之能與帝國美術抗衡全是牠的時代與超時代之表現而牽拒敵方的模倣與規矩之强頑但是不幸之二科會爆裂了在第十七回展覽會後爆裂了</p>
<p>雖然二科會圑體力减少是常有的事但常得加入者比退出者强而現在所失實在地可謂非輕將來能得入加者有現在退出者之强勇與否是難料或許二科便從此弱了但是已經在日本美術界得了十餘年之老歷史之二科會端不能易於傾弱吧我想</p>
<p>日本人是喜出奇新穎可是一羣至日本現代美術界的前面跑着的二科會牠的急先鋒們跑走了跑出二科會的範圍圈内而追趕他們自有的目標去了去了急先鋒的野獸羣這對於能力量去牽抗帝國美術院的二科會是如何悲傷呢二科若欲繼續本有之光榮勢力除非是再繼續努力審愼去追尋那努力聰明的作家</p>
<p>這爆了出來的一班二科會的急進作家這野獸羣他們集了别會的名將至日本美壇上突插了一個［獨立美術協會］這是日本藝壇加多了一盞照明燈因爲他們每個在日本藝壇上已是像天上的星光般的閃耀着的</p>
<p>假如他們力不足和力不努而再隕消的話那便没説是當然但是這羣力量的確地不薄他們全是二科的主要作家而且是二科會主要作家的三分之一而且全是二科的急先鋒</p>
<p>這野獸羣的作品是至日本現代社會的前頭跑的是譏諷反抗醜惡逃遁的表現是强烈的衝動的銀色</p>
<p>這［獨立美術協會］的發起人們是里見勝藏兒島善三郎二科會會員林重義林武中山巍鈴木亞夫小島善太郎鈴木保德二科會會友川口軌外淸水登之伊藤廉是本年二科會得賞省其餘的一位是春陽會無鑑查者和一位是國會會員第一回展覽會是在明年正月十日拭目待之</p>
<p>他們多是去年從一九三○年美術協會脱出而加入二科會的這一九三○年美術協會也是在日本本來很有勢力的圑體但是自從去年分裂後自從今年死了一個台柱前因寛治氏後便沉到似乎消滅了所以在這全盛時期的二科會裏又脱退了這一羣今後的二科會是很値得我們注意的而帝國美術院又突撞了一個勢力雄厚的在野圑體也是一樣的値得我們注意</p>
<p>我寫這篇完全地是一個報告報告與我親愛的美術師友</p>
<p>現在學校裏的敎師給我曉得他們是非常驚慌與感嘆着呢就是局外人也是一般地非常驚奇</p>

<h3 id="e3">Matters Regarding the Taiwanese Aborigines and Vietnam <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the resistance of various colonies against their governments is not entirely due to the development of nationalistic ideas, but also due to the pressure of livelihood issues. Resisting political oppression is for the survival of the nation, while resisting economic oppression is for the survival of individuals and families. Therefore, at a time when nationalistic ideas are developing, and then adding the pressure of livelihood issues, it is like suffering two kinds of unbearable hardships. Their uprising and resistance will inevitably be more intense. The British resistance in India has already been a clear example. Recently, the Taiwanese aborigines' resistance against Japan has been investigated, and the biggest reason is that the wage rates have fallen so drastically that the aborigines have no way to make a living. The Vietnamese resistance against France, according to people in the colonial department, is driven by hunger, leading them to take risks. These are all due to the fact that their lives cannot be sustained. Since they resist because they cannot survive, then death is no longer something they fear. Therefore, the Taiwanese aborigines' resistance all has a determination to die. Even when faced with the violent bombardment of a large army, they would rather commit suicide than surrender slightly. The Vietnamese resistance is becoming more and more widespread with increasing pressure. Even after suffering heavy losses from the fierce attacks of aircraft, bombs, and machine guns, they still do not show any weakness. It can be seen that dealing with it with harsh methods has already proven to be ineffective. If the harsh methods currently used are ineffective and more harsh methods are to be adopted, then, as the French colonial department said, it will only increase their resentment. The people do not fear death, so how can you scare them with death? It is extremely unwise. Therefore, the only way to deal with this kind of resistance that arises for survival is to help them find a way to survive. Is there any other alternative?</p>

<p>Endeavoring to Praise the Kellogg-Briand Pact. A United Press telegram from Washington on the 10th. In his Armistice Day speech today, President Hoover vigorously praised the good American men who died in the European War, saying that it is America's duty to prevent future war horrors and expenses. This year is the most remarkable period for the progress of peace. The London Naval Treaty is one of its special products. Increasing peace cannot be achieved in a year or two, because the causes of war among countries in the world are emerging one after another. Mr. Hoover also said that the Kellogg-Briand Pact occupies a significant position in the international situation. From ancient times to the present, this is the only empty piece of paper that holds such great power. Mr. Hoover then went on to describe the mutual agreements of various countries on arbitration and reconciliation, predicting that within a few years, all countries in the world will be bound by them. Our greatest hope is to seek the effectiveness of international law to be universal throughout the world, so that war can disappear from now on. In addition, the World Court has a solid organization. From now on, it can create many precedents in international law. This is what our United States should do its best to assist. This is not only for the benefit of our country, but also for the development of peace in the world.</p>

<p>National Telegram from Paris on the 10th. The French financial turmoil has not subsided. This afternoon, Munro Bank, the oldest American business established in France, suspended cash payments, causing most British and American depositors to panic.

<p>Moderate Faction Holds the Balance; The Power of the Home Guard Party is Formidable. National Press Agency Telegram from Vienna on the 10th. The results of the Austrian election show that neither the Social Democratic Party nor its political enemy, the Christian Social Party, won an absolute majority, resulting in a complete stalemate. This places the quasi-Home Guard's Self-Defense Force and former Prime Minister Schober's Moderate faction in a pivotal position between the two parties. According to the latest reports, the Social Democratic Party won 73 seats (11 seats in the previous session), the Christian Social Party won 66 seats (73 seats in the previous session), Schober's Moderate faction won 19 seats (21 seats in the previous session), and the Self-Defense Force won 8 seats (none in the previous session). (These seat numbers may still change somewhat.) Therefore, the current cabinet is in the minority in the new parliament without the support of Schober's faction. Since the current Minister of the Interior, Prince Starhemberg, leader of the Self-Defense Force, controls the government, Schober may not be willing to cooperate with him. If so, the result will be one of three: 1. Schober returns to form a cabinet; 2. Parliament is dissolved and re-elected; 3.

<p>Germany and Russia Abstain from Voting. Reuters Telegram from Geneva on the 10th. The Disarmament Committee today passed Article 1 of the amendment to the Disarmament Convention with 19 votes. It is now stipulated that compulsory military service each year shall not exceed the period decided by the future Disarmament Conference. Germany and Russia did not vote.</p>
<p>National Press Agency Telegram from Geneva on the 10th. Today, the Disarmament Preparatory Committee had a fierce debate on whether to limit the military service years of the conscription system. France, Belgium, and Yugoslavia opposed setting a clear limit, while Britain, Poland, and Romania supported setting a limit. At the height of the debate, the French representative even declared that France would extend the conscription period to two years from 1933. The German representative, as stated last time, abstained from voting. As a result, it was finally decided that each country should determine the conscription period itself, but the Disarmament Conference should set a maximum period. In addition, representatives of the five major naval powers, after four days of negotiations, have agreed that the number of reserves need not be restricted in the future Disarmament Conference. Only the number of active naval personnel will be divided into three categories: officers, petty officers, and soldiers, and restricted separately. It is also heard that the French-Italian naval issue has also been discussed and has made some progress. Negotiations may reopen on Thursday. National Press Agency Telegram from Geneva on the 11th. The Disarmament Preparatory Conference today discussed the issue of limiting actual armaments. German representative Mr. Bernstorff spoke, saying that disarmament will ultimately be empty talk if actual armaments are not reduced. The scope of reduction cannot be limited to the naval aspect alone; the army and air force must be reduced uniformly. Afterwards, the meeting discussed several other motions on the agenda and then declared two minutes of silence to commemorate the date twelve years ago when the European War ended.</p>

<p>Reuters Telegram from London on the 10th. British Foreign Secretary Henderson stated in the House of Commons today in response to a question from a member of parliament that the British Ambassador to China goes to the new capital at any time, and the Counselor of the British Embassy travels between Nanjing and Shanghai, often contacting the National Government. The Foreign Secretary also stated that the method of disposal of the British Boxer Rebellion Indemnity, as recently agreed upon between the central government, must be approved by Parliament before it can take effect. The government will submit the necessary motion as soon as possible. Former Conservative Party Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lampson, asked whether it was true that the huge amount of indemnity reported in the newspapers would be handed over to China for the construction of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, which was different from the recommendation of the Advisory Committee in 1925. Labour Party MP Mills asked whether the British government's abandonment of its due indemnity was because Soviet Russia had automatically canceled its indemnity seven years ago. Conservative Party MP Samuel asked whether the Foreign Secretary could negotiate the case of 36,000 yuan in unpaid salaries owed to British engineers on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. Foreign Secretary Henderson replied that he would answer after consideration.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Request by the Ministry of Railways to Complete the Longhai Railway <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Sun Ke's Proposal to the Fourth Plenary Session: Minister of Railways Sun Ke yesterday submitted three proposals to the Fourth Plenary Session: (1) To allocate two-thirds of the entire Russian indemnity to complete the Longhai Railway project and to instruct the immediate transfer of the indemnity to the Ministry for management and allocation, facilitating railway construction. (2) To ensure that a portion of the allocated two-thirds of the Russian indemnity is used to supplement the funding for completing the Longhai Railway, and the remainder is used to repair steel bridges on various railways. Furthermore, to instruct the immediate transfer of the indemnity to the Ministry for management and allocation, facilitating railway construction. (3) To continue the three-year tax exemption on the transportation of materials for state-owned railways to facilitate construction. The proposal regarding the completion of the Longhai Railway is as follows:</p>
<p>Proposal One (Reasons): Upon reviewing the resolution of the Second Plenary Session last year, it was decided to allocate two-thirds of the entire indemnity for railway construction, with a stipulation to prioritize the completion of various railways. The Longhai Railway was scheduled to be completed by the end of 1933. This year, the Third Plenary Session further resolved that the National Government should urge relevant authorities to earnestly fulfill the political resolutions of the Second Plenary Session and execute them on schedule. The Ministry, in compliance, has planned the completion of various Longhai Railway projects, estimating that construction and material costs of approximately 124.09 million yuan will be required by the end of 1934. Preparations are complete, but construction has yet to commence due to the lack of allocated funds. Considering the importance of completing this railway in all aspects, any further delay is unacceptable. The reasons are briefly outlined as follows: Firstly, Feng's repeated rebellions were due to the inconvenient transportation in the Northwest and its distance from the central government, making it easy to resist. Now that the Northwest war is nearing its end, this railway is crucial for military and political unification. If completed soon, it will be difficult for warlords to harbor ambitions of division and resistance against the central government. For the sake of consolidating unification, rapid completion is necessary. Secondly, the Northwest has suffered from years of drought, with millions dying of starvation daily. The tragic situation of exchanging children for food is still occurring today, due to inconvenient transportation and difficult transportation. Even if food is supplied from elsewhere, transporting it to the destination by human or animal power takes time and the quantity is limited, making it impossible to save the starving people in remote areas. If this railway can be completed, such tragedies will no longer occur. For the sake of saving the lives of the people in the Northwest, rapid completion is necessary. Thirdly, the Tu-Xi Railway, parallel to the border between Soviet Russia and Xinjiang, has been completed and opened to traffic in May of this year. This railway is close to the Xinjiang border and aims to absorb China's Northwest resources, taking the opportunity to seize China's border areas and continue the Russian Empire's ambition of aggression. If China urgently catches up and completes the Longhai Railway first, and then plans to extend it directly to Xinjiang, it can contend with Russia and remedy the future. For the sake of national defense and the national economy, rapid completion is necessary. Furthermore, the central government has resolved that the Longhai Railway should be completed by 1934, a decision that is known both domestically and internationally. However, due to the impact of the war, progress has been slow, and another year has passed. If this delay continues, people will think that our party is merely making empty promises with little practical action, resulting in a significant loss of credibility both internationally and among the people. For the sake of fulfilling the central government's previous resolutions and maintaining the party's credibility, rapid completion is necessary. (Methods) The Russian indemnity earmarked for railway construction, projected from 1930 to 1940, is estimated at over 113.12 million yuan. Allocating two-thirds of this indemnity annually to issue public bonds to complete the Longhai Railway is the most convenient method. The Ministry has carefully considered and planned to directly allocate the remaining 9.5 million yuan from the 1930 and 1931 Russian indemnity to the 1931 Longhai project. In addition, two-thirds of the entire Russian indemnity from 1932 onwards will be used as a fund to issue 67 million yuan in public bonds. Assuming a net receipt of 95%, or 63.65 million yuan, and with the remaining indemnity from previous years used to repay the principal and interest of the bonds, approximately 17 million yuan will be used to complete the entire Longhai Railway project. The remaining shortfall of 33.89 million yuan will be supplemented by the accumulated Russian indemnity balance up to 1929. Furthermore, it is proposed to issue public bonds for the Longhai Railway itself or request the government to allocate additional national funds as a subsidy. Regarding the issue of managing the indemnity, the Ministry has requested the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Finance to comply with the resolution of the Second Plenary Session and transfer two-thirds of the entire Russian indemnity to the Ministry for management and allocation, facilitating construction. In April of this year, the central government resolved that two-thirds of the indemnity should be transferred by the Ministry of Finance to the Ministry of Railways for management. From the date the Ministry of Railways takes over, the two-thirds of the education expenses originally allocated from the Russian indemnity will be borne by the Ministry of Railways. The Executive Yuan has instructed the Ministry and ordered the Ministries of Finance and Education to comply. The Ministry immediately informed the Ministry of Finance to instruct the Director-General of Customs to allocate two-thirds of the accumulated and future Russian indemnity on schedule for the Ministry's management and allocation. However, due to the situation at the time, the Ministry of Finance has not complied. Now that the military situation has ended and the overall situation is stabilizing, the Ministry urgently needs the indemnity to be allocated as a fund to issue public bonds for the completion of the Longhai Railway project. The takeover and allocation cannot be delayed any further. I respectfully request that the Council review and determine that two-thirds of the Russian indemnity be specifically used to complete the Longhai Railway project, and instruct the Ministry of Finance to immediately transfer the aforementioned Russian indemnity, along with the accumulated balance from previous years, to the Ministry for management and allocation. Although the railway construction was delayed by one year due to the war, it can still be completed by 1935, as originally planned, to comply with the central government's resolutions and benefit railway construction and the country. I would like to add that the expenses of various colleges in Peiping were previously not paid due to the national treasury's deficiency. It has been stipulated that 350,000 yuan be advanced monthly from the Russian indemnity. According to the regulations, each institution using the indemnity should pay interest at a rate of 5%. If the amount of indemnity used in recent years is small, the monthly interest will not be sufficient to cover 350,000 yuan. To ensure comprehensive consideration, the Ministry plans to have the institutions managing the Russian indemnity guarantee that if the monthly interest is insufficient to cover 350,000 yuan, they will still be responsible for raising the funds from the indemnity to ensure the full amount is paid monthly by the managing institutions proportionally. When the accumulated indemnity used in the future increases and the monthly interest exceeds 350,000 yuan, the amount will be deducted accordingly to ensure that education expenses are not affected and that construction projects can proceed as scheduled. I have combined the requests for determining the use of the Russian indemnity and instructing its allocation, along with the assumed exchange rate for gold pounds, the balance sheet of the Russian indemnity, the repayment schedule for public bonds issued from the Russian indemnity, the budget for various expenses for completing the Longhai Railway project, and the calculation table for completing the Longhai Railway using the balance of the Russian indemnity to issue bonds, and respectfully submit them to the Council for public decision. (Four attached tables omitted.)</p>
<p>Proposal Two (Explanation): Upon reviewing the resolution of the Second Plenary Session last year regarding the allocation of the indemnity for development and construction, the first item decided to prioritize the completion of the Longhai Railway by the end of 1933, and the second item decided to allocate two-thirds of the entire indemnity for railway construction. The Third Plenary Session this year further resolved that the National Government should urge relevant authorities to earnestly fulfill the political resolutions of the Second Plenary Session. The Ministry, responsible for railway construction, should earnestly comply. The plan for completing the Longhai Railway has been drafted, and a separate proposal requesting the determination of two-thirds of the Russian indemnity for the completion of the project has been submitted to the Council. However, the plan for completing the Longhai Railway requires approximately 124.09 million yuan in construction and material costs. After allocating two-thirds of the entire Russian indemnity, there is still a shortfall of approximately 33.89 million yuan, which is a significant amount. Considering the current financial difficulties of the country, raising such a large sum is not easy. Since the railway is the focus of railway construction and the completion deadline is approaching, it is essential to plan ahead and allocate funds to supplement the shortfall. As the allocation of two-thirds of the entire indemnity for railway construction was resolved by the Second Plenary Session, the Italian indemnity, according to the agreement, should be paid. The advance payment from the Bank of Italy has been repaid, and the remaining amount can be used annually from July of this year. It is estimated that the total remaining amount of the Italian indemnity from July 1930 to the end of 1938 is US$23,658,579.81, and two-thirds of that is US$15,772,386.48. Converted at a rate of 3.5, it is approximately 55,023,52.68 silver dollars. It is proposed to determine that two-thirds of the total remaining amount of the indemnity be used to supplement the aforementioned shortfall for completing the Longhai project, and the remainder be used to repair steel bridges on various railways, so that the entire Longhai line can be completed on schedule without failure, and the steel bridges on various railways that urgently need to be rebuilt and repaired, such as the Yellow River Bridge on the Pinghan Railway and the Cao'e River Bridge on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, can be planned and repaired in order, which will greatly benefit railway construction and national transportation. If the decision is approved, and the National Government is instructed to promptly transfer the indemnity to the Ministry for management and allocation to facilitate progress. I am submitting a list of the remaining Italian indemnity and a detailed proposal for public decision. (Attached tables omitted.)</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government has Drafted Transfer Measures, Hoping for a Resolution at This Meeting. The border demarcation issue between Jiangsu Province and Nanjing Municipality has been unresolved for a long time, and repeated meetings have yielded no results. To promptly resolve this issue, the Ministry of Interior has scheduled another meeting between the two parties in Nanjing at 2 PM today (the 11th) to discuss measures. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has instructed various departments to appoint representatives to attend. It is reported that Wu Danping from the Department of Construction, Lin Wenqin from the Department of Civil Affairs, Yin Shifen from the Department of Finance, Lu Yaokun from the Department of Education, and Wang Hao from the Department of Agriculture and Mining, along with Lin, Yin, Lu, and Wang, have already gone to Nanjing yesterday. Mr. Wu is also scheduled to arrive this morning. It is reported that the point of contention between the two sides is the issue of tax revenue. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has drafted transfer measures to be submitted for discussion. If the boundary can be smoothly determined at this meeting, both parties can dispatch personnel to conduct a joint survey and demarcation, which can be completed within a month.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Recent Bandit Situation in Hunan Province <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The Hunan Rehabilitation Committee held an emergency meeting on the 6th of this month, as the banditry has been spreading, and relying solely on a portion of the Fourth Route Army is not sufficient to suppress them. It was decided to appoint Huang Zhenyuan as a representative to go to Nanjing to petition the National Government and the Fourth Plenary Session to dispatch a large army to encircle and suppress the communist bandits in the three provinces. Simultaneously, telegrams were sent to public organizations in Hubei and Jiangxi provinces, requesting them to send representatives to the capital to petition as well. Peng Zhaohuang was also appointed as a representative to visit He Jian, requesting attention to blocking and intercepting the bandits to prevent the provincial capital from suffering from bandit disasters again. The bandit situation in various areas is described as follows: In the Jinli area, after the bandits led by He Kuang and others captured Nanhua, He Jian dispatched the 16th Division Commander Peng Weiren, leading the Liu Jiren and Cheng Tiexia brigades, from Yuanjiang to suppress the bandits in western Hunan. The bandit suppression commander Dai Huiyuan, leading the Li Guojun and Xiang Kequan groups, advanced from Hanshou and Yuanjiang to suppress them. The Sichuan Army under Lai Xinhui, Zhang Ying and Ma Kunshan's divisions, advanced from Anxiang to suppress them. The First Garrison Commander Chen Quzhen's forces, Chen Yunkui and Dai Jitao's groups, advanced from Jinshi and Lizhou to suppress them in all directions. Consequently, on the 30th of last month, Nanhua County was recaptured. On the 1st of this month, Meitian Lake was recaptured, and on the 3rd, Huarong was recaptured. Initially, it was thought that the bandits had fled back to Hubei Province, but unexpectedly, He Kuang and others adopted a feint to the east and attacked Jinshi from the Lianyu Xu by surprise. As only Chen Yunkui and Dai Jitao's groups were stationed there, they could not resist due to the disparity in numbers and were forced to retreat and defend Lizhou County. Jinshi was lost on the 4th. That night, the bandits pursued and besieged Lizhou, launching a fierce attack. On the 5th, Lizhou also fell. Chen and Dai's troops retreated to defend He Kou. The Lizhou County Magistrate Zuo Zonggu fled to Linli. He Jian was extremely anxious upon receiving the news and immediately sent telegrams to Peng Weiren and the Sichuan Army's Zhang and Ma divisions, ordering them to advance from Anxiang towards Jinshi and Lizhou. He ordered Dai Huiyuan and Li Guojun to lead their troops to encircle and attack Jinshi and Lizhou from Changde and Linli. Chen Quzhen was ordered to lead his troops to block the area of Shimen He Kou to prevent them from advancing further. He also ordered the Changtao Garrison Commander He Ying to be on alert in Changde and Taoyuan. It is reported that after He Kuang and others captured Jinshi and Lizhou, they threatened to invade Changde and Taoyuan. In the Cha An area, the most urgent bandit situation in Hunan Province is in the Chaling Youxian Anren area in eastern Hunan, in addition to Jinli in western Hunan. A part of the communist bandits under Zhu Mao, after entering Hunan from Lianhua in western Jiangxi, joined Chen Shao's gang and captured Chaling on the 2nd of this month, and Anren on the 6th. The defending forces there were the 19th Division's Deng Nanji Brigade and the Liling Guard Corps' Yu Gongqian's forces, who have now retreated to defend Youxian. Upon receiving the news, He Jian telegraphed the Hunan Southern Garrison Commander Duan Heng and the Hunan Southern Militia First Column Commander Zeng Zhengyan to quickly defend the Lai Shui and Xiang Shui lines to strictly prevent them from advancing. He also telegraphed the 19th Division Commander Li Jue, ordering him to lead the troops stationed in Pingxiang back to Hunan to attack in Youxian and Liling. Currently, the people in various counties in eastern Hunan have fled to Changsha and Hengzhou to seek refuge. In the Pingliu area, Pingjiang and Liuyang counties have long been bandit dens. The pseudo-Red Army Red Guards (i.e., bandits with spears) in Liuyang claim to have as many as six divisions, and even more in Pingjiang. The armed bandits in Pingjiang and Liuyang were originally the gangs of Kong Hechong and Li Shixing, with three to four thousand guns. Recently, Huang Gonglue has fled from Jiangxi into Pingjiang, and Peng Dehuai's main force will also flee back to the old nests of Pingjiang and Liuyang, leading to an extremely tense situation. The 30th Division Commander Tao Guang is currently defending the Zhusha Ao and Genggu Tai area on the Changping border. Since the 3rd, the communist bandits have again attacked Zhusha Ao and Genggu Tai. After four days and nights of fierce fighting, Tao Guang supervised the Hou Pengfei, Zhong Guangren, and Chen Wo brigades, as well as the Second Bandit Suppression Battalion led by Zhu Xingshu, to launch a counterattack. Although many were killed or captured, the bandits have not yet retreated and are still in a stalemate. In the Liuyang area, Chen Guangzhong and Bai Shinou's forces are currently stationed near the county seat, preparing to first eliminate the scattered bandits in the vicinity and then suppress them in the surrounding villages.

<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the communist bandits captured Ji'an on the 5th of last month, more than eight divisions have been sent to aid Jiangxi, but Ji'an has not yet been recovered. The people from Jiangxi in Wuhan have specially appointed representatives Liu Shaoqing, Yang Zhensheng, and more than ten others to take the Fengyang Maru to Nanjing on the evening of the 9th to petition for the swift suppression of the communist bandits in Ji'an and to request funds for disaster relief. It is reported that if this trip does not yield satisfactory results, they will appeal to the Fourth Plenary Session to achieve their goals. The petition presented by the representatives in Nanjing is as follows: Firstly, we urgently request the military and political authorities of Jiangxi Province to swiftly dispatch a strong army to jointly suppress the communist bandits in Ji'an to save the people and maintain the overall situation. Unfortunately, Jiangxi is plagued by communist bandits, and the ten counties under the jurisdiction of Ji'an, an old prefecture in western Jiangxi, have long been reduced to red areas, where they search and burn deeds, excavate fields, gather in the villages, and demand everything from every household, using every means. The good people have nowhere to stand and can only take refuge in Ji'an. This time, the Zhu Mao communist bandits led a large force of bandits, crossed into Lianhua from Xiang, and suddenly raided Ji'an County on the 5th of last month. The county was lost, the red flames soared into the sky, and the cries shook the wilderness. The refugees who fled from Ji'an had no way to survive and could not even seek death. It was truly an unprecedented catastrophe. According to the emergency reports from the Ji'an refugees, the bandits are killing hundreds of people every day. Those with a little property are kidnapped and extorted, and young women are imprisoned and raped. The stores and households are looted clean. In severe cases, farmers are ordered to take revenge and kill each household, resulting in piles of corpses and rivers of blood. This tragic scene is heartbreaking. The Ji'an refugees have repeatedly telegraphed the provincial authorities, urging them to quickly send troops to advance and suppress the bandits, but for more than a month, there has been no sign of advance. We do not understand why. Currently, the communist bandits entrenched in Ji'an are actively organizing a Soviet government, establishing a Communist Party headquarters, and implementing communist work. If we allow this to continue to spread, not only will millions of lives be lost, but the situation in the provincial capital will also be in danger. Even more tragically, the ten counties of Ji'an have been looted clean. Even if we recover them, the remaining refugees will have no clothes or food and will either die from gunfire or starvation. Therefore, we rushed to Nanjing day and night to petition your government to quickly telegraph Chairman Lu to swiftly dispatch a capable army to Ji'an to suppress the bandits in the ten counties, and to telegraph Chief Commander Liu to return to Jiangxi to cooperate in suppressing the bandits, with a deadline to recover Ji'an and the ten counties under its jurisdiction. We also ask for funds to be allocated for disaster relief to save the people from fire and water and to stabilize the overall situation. With tears in our eyes, we present this urgent plea and await your orders.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Overseas Chinese in Nanyang Appeal for the Xu Case <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The Xu Zhuoran assassination case in Xiamen has now been transferred to the Hangzhou District Court for trial. The people of Fujian are paying close attention to this, and the overseas Chinese in Nanyang are particularly concerned. Recently, the Tong'an Fellow Association of the Fujianese in Batavia, Java, in Nanyang, sent another telegram to the Judicial Yuan and the Higher and Local Courts of Hangzhou, stating that Xu Zhuoran was a pillar of the party and the nation, and his assassination caused great sorrow among the people. Since the occurrence of this case, all eyes have been on it, hoping that the perpetrators would be apprehended and punished according to the law. Unexpectedly, Mr. Chen Yanxiang, who was known to be close to Xu, was also implicated. Subsequently, various social groups and overseas Chinese repeatedly appealed, and the Xiamen judge carefully investigated and confirmed that he had been falsely accused and granted bail. Since Mr. Chen Yanxiang has been cleared of the false accusation and granted bail, it is appropriate to quickly dismiss the case against him. Recently, it was heard that this case has been transferred to the Zhejiang Hangzhou Court for investigation. The government is cautious about these matters, and it seems unnecessary for us to dwell on them, especially as we live far away. However, considering that Mr. Chen and Mr. Xu were like-minded and shared the same ideals, and there has never been any resentment or conflict of interest between them, it is clear that there is no reason for anyone to cause death without a cause. This is very clear. When judging a person, one must look at their usual behavior. We, overseas Chinese, have carefully considered the situation and observed that Mr. Chen Yanxiang's usual behavior is trustworthy. Therefore, we have sent letters and telegrams to appeal on his behalf. Furthermore, Mr. Chen is currently the general manager of the Tongmei Road Company. This road was established entirely with overseas Chinese capital. If he is implicated in the Xu case and goes to Hangzhou to await trial, there will be no suitable person to take his place in road administration. We fear that the delay will inevitably hinder the progress of road administration, and the capital of overseas Chinese will be greatly affected. We have always admired our government's unwavering support for overseas Chinese investment and business ventures. Therefore, we earnestly request your court to investigate and adjudicate the Xu case impartially. Since Mr. Chen has been confirmed to have been falsely accused, it is appropriate to quickly dismiss the case against him so that road administration can be maintained and the innocent can avoid being implicated. This would fulfill the wishes of the overseas Chinese and be a virtuous act.</p>

<p>Meeting of the Joint Military and Police Inspection Office: Since the establishment of the Joint Military and Police Inspection Office in this county, local defense has become more meticulous. However, due to limited funds, there was a brief discussion at yesterday's committee meeting. One issue was that the number of informants was too small, and it was proposed to add six more. It was also noted that the informants have heavy responsibilities and low pay, and it was proposed to consider increasing their salaries. The chief of informants, Yang Shijie, has recently solved several bandit cases, and his travel and accommodation expenses between Songjiang and Shanghai have been paid by himself. It was also requested that he be compensated. It was decided to redistribute the original budget of 360 yuan per month and reorganize various uses. A list of expenses will be submitted for discussion at the next meeting. Furthermore, there is no funding available for the daily food rations of imprisoned bandits. It was decided to allocate 1.5 jiao per person per day, to be reported and claimed every ten days. Chrysanthemum Exhibition of the Horticultural Research Association: The flower-loving gentlemen of this county have formed a Horticultural Research Association.

<h3 id="e58">Suzhou <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Frequent Kidnappings in Rural Suzhou: A few days ago, five bandits armed with handguns raided the home of Wang Ayi, a Shaoxing farmer in Tanqiu Village, Pingwang Township, Wujiang County, and kidnapped his 15-year-old grandson, Wang Tianyou. They left a ransom note demanding a large sum of money. Also, ten bandits raided the Ma Xiangji Nanhua store in Houpu Town, Xishan County, the night before last, and robbed them of four to five hundred yuan in silver dollars. Before leaving, they kidnapped the store owner Ma Wenxiang and his grandson Ma Yuekui. Gao Ying Case Extended for Three Months: The Supreme Court ruled on October 6 that the former San Francisco Vice-Consul Gao Ying and his secretary Sun Yuan's case involving the trafficking of opium should be reviewed by the court. The High Court believed that the case had international implications, so it was resolved to be handed over to the Criminal Division I, headed by Judge Lin Dawen. Judge Lin stated that the case required a thorough investigation of the evidence and could not be scheduled for trial in a short time. It is reported that it will be extended for three months. Once the evidence is clarified, a hearing will be scheduled, likely in January or February next year. Misunderstanding in Prison Investigation: Prison warden Wang Kaikai of Wujiang County was transferred from Qidong County only two months ago. After Wang took office, someone accused him of deducting prisoners' food rations. Earlier this month, the county magistrate of Wujiang, based on the accusation, sent Wu Guangxi to investigate the prison. At that time, Wu and the prison staff had a misunderstanding, leading to a conflict. The county magistrate immediately telegraphed the High Court to request instructions. President Lin, after receiving the telegram on the 8th of this month, appointed judicial committee member Yao Guozhang to conduct a thorough investigation. Committee member Yao returned to Suzhou yesterday to report the findings. According to the investigation, the situation at the time was indeed a misunderstanding between the two parties. Request to Reduce the Autumn Grain Tax Denied: The two county heads of Wu County convened local gentry to discuss and determine that 93% of the autumn grain harvest should be collected. The proposal was submitted to the Finance Department for approval. Yesterday (the 11th), the Finance Bureau issued an order stating that the autumn harvest in Suzhou and Changzhou counties was abundant, and most were collected in full. The situation in the county should be the same, and the full amount should be collected according to the new regulations. The request to reduce the collection by 7% was not approved. Frequent Banditry in Xishan: Recently, lake bandits have frequently occurred in the area of Lao Shushan near Xishan County, robbing ships and harassing people.

<p>Patrol Officer Abuses Power to Snatch Bride</p>
<p>It is said that Gao Wende, a patrol officer of the Third Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau outside the South Gate of Wuxi, is inherently wicked and lustful. Recently, he became intimate with the sister of Xu Shunfa, a Yancheng native residing in the area. They lived together like husband and wife. However, Xu's sister had already been betrothed to Li Jiazhong, a fellow townsman, through a matchmaker years ago. Li, who was working in Shanghai, recently chose an auspicious day and came to Wuxi the day before yesterday to marry Xu's sister and bring her home for the wedding ceremony. Unexpectedly, at around 4 a.m. the next morning, Patrol Officer Gao Wende led two police officers and, together with Xu Shunfa, went to the Li's residence and forcibly took Xu's sister away. Afterwards, Li Jiazhong reported the incident to the Third Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau. The head of the sub-bureau, Wang Tingshu, immediately dispatched police officers to detain Patrol Officer Gao Wende, Xu Shunfa, and Xu's sister after receiving the report. Following a preliminary trial by Director Wang, Li Jiazhong was ordered to pay sixty-four yuan as compensation and provide six sets of clothing before taking Xu's sister back. Meanwhile, Patrol Officer Gao Wende was dismissed and released. Li, considering the sub-bureau head's judgment unjust, went to Zhenjiang to seek assistance from the secretary-general. A certain gentleman, upon learning of the matter, immediately sent a letter to the stationed Xianbing (military police) in Wuxi, requesting Jin Deyi to forward it to the Public Security Bureau for a thorough investigation. Director Wang Tingshu, seeing the situation was unfavorable, detained Xu Shunfa, Xu's sister, and Li Jiazhong and sent them to the General Bureau. Yesterday, they were transferred to the county government. It is heard that the court ordered Li Jiazhong to take leave, while Xu Shunfa and Xu's sister were ordered to provide bail. Due to the inability to obtain bail, they were temporarily detained.</p>
<p>The county government decided on four important cases. Yesterday, the county government of Wuxi held its 64th county administration meeting, resolving the following matters:</p>
<p>(1) Ni Jianye, the acting district chief of the 14th District, submitted a proposal to collect urgent Cao taxes, suggesting that the district office print temporary receipts to be issued by the Jia heads to the payers to prevent abuses. The proposal included a sample receipt and requested review. It was resolved to forward it to the Finance Bureau for review and response.</p>
<p>(2) Hou Dan and other students from Wuxi studying at the Jiangsu Provincial Police Academy submitted a request for a subsidy of fifty yuan per student per semester due to financial difficulties. It was resolved that the local finances were extremely strained, making it impossible to allocate funds.</p>
<p>(3) It was proposed that the county's banquet tax be verified and collected by the Finance Bureau. It was resolved to proceed accordingly.</p>
<p>(4) It was proposed to find a way to prevent local thugs from causing trouble on the Wuxi-Chengdu road due to the rickshaws there. It was resolved to task the 6th, 12th, and 3rd Sub-bureaus of the Public Security Bureau to dispatch police to patrol and strictly investigate and handle such incidents.</p>
<p>Brother and Sister-in-law Engage in Adultery and Abuse the First Wife</p>
<p>It is reported that A'Man, the sister of Zhang Jilin, a villager from the 14th 4th Tu in the 16th District (Wan'an City), was married to Pan Sandao from Panxiang. The couple had been harmonious since their marriage. However, recently, Pan became romantically involved with his sister-in-law, Mrs. Pan, and began to treat his first wife like an eyesore, constantly insulting and beating her, causing A'Man to be covered in bruises. The day before yesterday, Pan Sandao, for some unknown reason, summoned local ruffians Pan Wushi, Pan Alin, Pan Wuda, Gao Chou, etc., and used thick iron chains to lock A'Man on the coffin of his deceased father, denying her food and drink. The villagers, upon seeing this, were outraged and immediately reported to A'Man's brother, Zhang Jilin, who went to negotiate with Pan Sandao. However, Pan refused to listen and, in a menacing manner, drove Zhang out. Zhang immediately filed a report with the county Public Security Bureau yesterday, requesting the dispatch of police officers to the village to arrest Pan Sandao, Mrs. Pan, and accomplices such as Pan Wubao, etc., for legal action. After receiving the report, Director Xu immediately dispatched armed police to arrest them. Just as they were about to escort the prisoners to the city, they were ambushed by a mob of local thugs, who completely snatched away the arrested individuals.</p>

<p>It is reported that Zhenxiu, the daughter of Zhou Huajia, a Huizhou native residing in the east of Guojia Temple, was betrothed by her parents to Tianren, the son of Yu Fusheng, a fellow townsman who runs a meat shop in Minhang. However, Yu's son was unattractive and weak, while the daughter was young and beautiful and educated. Therefore, she was greatly dissatisfied with the marriage. Because the woman's father was a follower of the old ethics, he rejected her repeated requests for annulment. On November 1st, the woman suddenly learned that the wedding date was approaching and, fearing a grave mistake, she was forced to elope with her lover, a certain Mr. You (currently a teacher at a certain school), to show her determination. Unexpectedly, the news leaked, and her father found out and placed her under guard. The woman, unable to achieve her goal, hanged herself in shame and anger last night.

The robbers entered the room and searched everywhere, and the silver dollars in the pockets of Mr. Li and others were also searched and looted. After the robbery, they went to the north. It is said that Wu Xushi's home was robbed because the family's daughter recently returned to her hometown from Wuxi to visit her mother, carrying trunks of clothing and goods, and therefore the robbers were coveting this.</p>

<p>The Patrol Team Exchanges Fire with Bandits in Zhangcun</p>
<p>It is reported that the patrol team of the Third District of the Nanxun Water Police in Huzhou arrested four bandits in the western countryside some days ago. They immediately questioned the bandits, who confessed that all the firearms were hidden near the empty tomb near the junction of Shiyang and Zhangcun. The team, according to the confession, immediately dispatched the former squad leader and fourteen police officers, along with the four bandits they had captured, to search on the morning of the 9th. Unexpectedly, as they were about to arrive at the place, a bandit ship suddenly came with more than ten bandits, each holding firearms, to pick up the bandit prisoners. At this time, the former squad leader, fearing that the bandit prisoners would be taken away, first executed the four bandits and then engaged in a battle with the incoming bandits. After an hour of fighting, because there were few soldiers and many bandits, two police officers were injured and the bandits also retreated. They captured a bandit ship and four guns.</p>
<p>A Widow Loses Her Body and Is Involved in Lawsuit</p>
<p>It is reported that Wu Chunsheng, an elderly man from Shujiawan, outside the North Gate, has a son, Ruizhi, who died of illness last year. The family consists of his widowed daughter-in-law, Mrs. Yang, who is not yet thirty years old and has a daughter. Because the family is poor and struggling to make ends meet, there is talk of her remarrying. A neighbor, a certain Shen, acted as matchmaker and arranged for her to marry a certain Zhang from the same village. However, Wu Chunsheng demanded an excessive bride price, and the marriage did not materialize. Because her widowed daughter-in-law believed that her father-in-law was demanding too much, she took her young daughter and left the house on the night before last, her whereabouts unknown. Wu, in a fit of anxiety, seized Shen and demanded the person, or else he would report to the police to investigate the abduction. The outcome of the discussion is yet unknown.</p>

<p>The Bandit Zhou Asheng is Arrested</p>
<p>It is reported that yesterday (the 9th) morning, more than ten fully armed bandits, including Zhou Asheng and Yang Ayin, the lieutenants of the gangster Taibao Ashu, came to Weiqian Town in the east of the county, and stayed in the vicinity of the Dongshi area. At around 12:00, many police officers of the Jiangsu Water Police led by Tan Meisheng, all dressed in civilian clothes, followed and arrived in the town. Zhou Asheng was smoking in the Swallow's Nest opened by A Quan. After learning this, each of the detectives bravely charged in with box cannons and arrested Zhou. Most of the other bandits were tasting tea in the teahouse and fled without a trace upon hearing the alarm. As a result, only one bandit, Zhou, was captured. It is said that Zhou was formerly a carpenter, but now he has joined Taibao Ashu's gang and is quite strong.</p>
<p>Shen Shoufu Was Killed by Bandits</p>
<p>It is said that Shen Shoufu from Xielefang was an assistant to the nuclear square guard Guo Quanhe. Three years ago, Liu Dexing stole someone's farm cattle and Shen arrested Liu and sent him to the county for a sentence of four months' imprisonment. This spring, Liu joined the bandit party when the bandits robbed Xinhui, and declared that he would kill Shen to avenge the old hatred. At the beginning of last month, the bandit Liu sneaked back to the village and was almost captured by the local guards. Afterwards, Liu suspected that Shen had reported him, and his hatred deepened. At about 10 p.m. on the 5th, Shen was sipping tea at A Lai's small teahouse when Liu suddenly broke in with a wooden-cased gun. Shoufu, seeing that the situation was not good, was about to flee, but Liu dragged him out of the teahouse and shot Shen five times in a row next to the nearby small beach. Fu Shou was killed on the spot. Liu, seeing that his goal had been achieved, led more than ten members of his gang and fled. The family of Shen and the village elders have reported to the county for investigation.</p>

<p>The Case of Counterfeit Silver Coins in Ruian County Suffers a Setback</p>
<p>It is reported that a case of private counterfeiting of silver coins occurred in the Baodi area of Ruian County in June of this year. The perpetrators were Dai Riming, Dai Richou, Li Desheng, and Dai Jianfan. The incident was discovered and reported by Dai Xiaolan, Dai Yezhi, and Dai Riren, residents of the area, to Sun Yu, the captain of the anti-smuggling battalion. The people and the evidence were seized. Then, a certain Dai Xuebo stepped in to mediate and gave the anti-smuggling battalion 1,400 yuan. Later, Dai Xiaolan and others learned of this. Considering that the case was of great importance and should be severely punished by the judicial authorities, they believed that the anti-smuggling battalion had dared to take bribes and let go of the perpetrators, which was illegal. They immediately filed a lawsuit with the Ruian Court. The court immediately dispatched police to arrest the defendants, but the defendants had all fled upon hearing the news. The captain of the anti-smuggling battalion was also dismissed and fled with the stolen goods. The case was suspended. Unexpectedly, the defendants spared no expense in secretly engaging people to make connections and lobby everywhere, but all failed to achieve their goals. Last month, the judge in charge of the case was suddenly transferred, and a certain Zhou succeeded him. The defendants thought there was an opportunity and engaged local gentry Mr. Jiang to secretly lobby Judge Zhou with a large sum of money. Judge Zhou suddenly ordered the plaintiffs Dai Xiaolan, Ye Zhi, or Riren to appear in court on the 28th of last month. Without questioning the situation, he ordered them to pay a cash bail of 500 yuan. Dai and others were in the position of plaintiffs, and the defendants had all fled. The plaintiffs should not be detained and charged innocently. It is heard that they have appealed to the higher court to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>The Dispute over the Contracting of Juzizhou Island</p>
<p>Juzizhou Island is originally a public property of Luhe and Jiangpu counties. All charitable undertakings rely on it. It is now heard that Ye Xin has contracted over 900 acres of new beach on the island from the Sandfield Bureau. People from Pu and Lu counties, upon learning of this, unanimously opposed it and urged the competent authorities to fight for their rights. Not an inch of local public property should be lost.</p>
<p>The Cotton Industry Strike</p>
<p>Although the number of cotton workers in Luhe is less than one hundred, many cotton workers from Jiangpu, Nanjing, Yizheng, Chuzhou, and other counties are from Luhe County. Therefore, the cotton workers of each county are under the control of Luhe. A month ago, the cotton workers here requested an increase in wages and went on strike once. As a result, wages were increased and work resumed. Unexpectedly, because the wages in other counties are now higher than those in Luhe, a second strike occurred on the 5th of this month. The capitalists, because the winter season is approaching and they urgently need goods, had no choice but to accept the workers' conditions and resume work as usual on the 8th of this month.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the report of the Liyang Coverup and Corruption Case in the Local News section of your esteemed newspaper on the 8th of this month, there are many inaccuracies regarding our association. After investigation, the representatives of our association who went to the provincial government to petition did not make such a claim. They only requested that the provincial government organize a special court to publicly try and severely punish the perpetrators of the case and the corrupt officials of the Kuomintang Party headquarters who initiated the coverup, in order to uphold the reputation of the Party. As for transferring the perpetrators to the judiciary for investigation, it is completely untrue and is what our association opposes the most. Fearing that the outside world may misunderstand due to unclear information, we specially send this letter for correction and request your understanding.</p>

<p>(Tokyo Electric News, 11th) The Student Union Committee of Waseda University held a meeting yesterday afternoon and put the mediation proposal of Nakano Seigo to a vote. After the split vote, the committee decided to reject the proposal. Five members of the Control Department Committee visited Nakano to inform him of the rejection. Nakano said that the Control Department was too irresponsible to endorse the mediation proposal and declared that he would no longer mediate. Students in the political science department in grades two and three who supported the mediation proposal withdrew from the union. Students in the science and engineering departments decided to start classes from today. The situation on the student side is gradually becoming chaotic.</p>

<p>Since the Provincial Government passed a motion in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th meetings to appoint Song Binggong as the Director of the Education Bureau, the 6th Standing Committee of the County Education Association resolved unanimously to reject the motion. A telegram has been found, the contents of which are transcribed below:</p>
<p>To Chen, Director of the Education Department in Zhenjiang: We have recently read in the newspapers that the Provincial Government has passed a motion to appoint Song Binggong to succeed the Director of the County Education Bureau. We are deeply puzzled by this news. The current Director, Zhuang Yijian, has been diligent in his work and has spared no effort in planning and implementing education throughout the county. He has been dedicated to his duties and is well-liked by the public. A sudden change may cause disputes. Article 17 of the revised County Organization Law promulgated by the National Government in July of this year stipulates that the Director of each County Education Bureau should be selected by the County Magistrate from qualified candidates after examination and submitted for approval. Article 7 of the regulations on the organization of County Education Bureaus promulgated by your department also has the same provision. If it is necessary to change the Director of the County Education Bureau, the selection procedure by the County Magistrate should be followed to comply with the law. Moreover, Song Binggong is a native of another county and is completely unfamiliar with the educational situation in the county. Taking on this position suddenly will make it difficult to achieve results due to the lack of familiarity with the people and the place. We believe that whether the Director is well-suited for the job is crucial to the future of education, and we believe that there is no need to change the current Director. We hereby submit a telegram respectfully requesting your department to review it and promptly submit it to the Provincial Government to withdraw the order, so as to avoid disputes and comfort the public. The entire Executive Committee of the Fengxian County Education Association bows in unison.</p>

<h3 id="e76">The First District Party Headquarters Opposes the Establishment of an Education Department <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The Nationalist Society's First District Party Headquarters in this city issued a declaration opposing the establishment of an education department by the Municipal Council, stating that the Shanghai concessions have existed for over eighty years. During these eighty years, imperialists have used them to realize their economic and cultural aggression. The impact has led to the daily collapse of China's economic state, and the people's livelihood has become increasingly difficult. Disturbances, robberies, disasters, and internal wars, all kinds of unfortunate phenomena occur from time to time within the country. For the sake of expanding their own interests, imperialists do not care about the life or death of China. They cruelly and brutally oppress the Chinese people, who are living in a dreamlike state, awakening from intoxication to awareness, and uniting together like scattered sand. The nationalist movement has swept the country. For forty years, the development of this movement has been dissatisfied with the government, which led to its overthrow, and the Republic of China was born. Although the nationalist movement only seeks the survival of the nation and does not resist oppression, this obstacle to national survival means the imperialist nationalist movement will never succeed. Therefore, in recent years, China's nationalist movement has shifted from internally overthrowing the Manchu government to externally overthrowing imperialism. In this nationalist movement, there is no day without struggle. We deeply recognize that the only condition for this movement to exert sustained force is to awaken national consciousness and cultivate national consciousness. We have no doubt that the way to awaken and cultivate this national consciousness lies in education. In the process of imperialists invading weak nations, they also pay attention to cultural aggression. They recognize that the only driving force for undermining and weakening national movements, which is national consciousness, requires the use of cultural aggression as a tool. The headquarters of imperialist cultural aggression in China, the missionary schools, have survived and expanded for nearly a hundred years under the protection of unequal treaties. The deep-rooted foundation they have built makes us astonished and frightened. The students cultivated in this cultural aggression headquarters, what are they like? Most of their thoughts are numb, and their national consciousness has long been destroyed. Social dancing intoxicates their entire lives. All their actions indicate that they are willing to be meritorious servants of imperialist economic aggression. Imperialists have cultivated a land full of cultural aggression and meritorious servants of economic aggression, young people with weakened thoughts. They are not satisfied, and they believe that they should further their aggression. The Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council recently established an education department to act out its vicious means of cultural aggression and eliminate our national consciousness. The Education Department is the highest educational administrative organ of the Republic of China. Within the territory of the Republic of China, no second education department is allowed to exist, and the Shanghai Public Concession is not allowed to have similar organizations to realize its cultural aggression and eliminate national consciousness. The party headquarters in this district, in response to the Municipal Council's contempt for China's sovereignty and insult to the people of the whole country, in addition to quietly awaiting the government to lodge a serious protest, has no choice but to vigorously oppose it. It also hopes that the people of the whole country will recognize the importance of this move amid the advancement of imperialist cultural aggression, and jointly resist it, and then eliminate the concessions produced by unequal treaties, which are tools of this cultural aggression, in order to seek the survival of our nation. This declaration is hereby made.</p>

<p>News from the Student Union of Nanyang Medical College: When the National Revolutionary Army recovered Shanghai in 1927, when it was time to recover educational rights, the principal of the school, the Japanese Tsunomiya Hiroshi, resigned. The School Affairs Maintenance Committee elected Wu Zongqing as the principal. In 1928, the school began to be established. Long before Wu Zongqing succeeded as principal for a year, the school and hospital equipment in the era of the Japanese Tsunomiya Hiroshi were very impressive, such as the bacterial practice room. All kinds of bacterial cultures should have everything. The affiliated hospital was in charge of the chief professor. The practice materials were very abundant. Now the bacterial practice room is covered with dust, and the practice materials are brought by the professor in private. Only one graduate of the school serves as a doctor in the affiliated hospital. There are very few patients every day. The internal situation of the school is very different from before. Since the beginning of this semester, the students' general assembly has proposed four minimum improvement plans, requiring Wu to adopt them. Wu initially agreed to convene a joint meeting to solve the problem, and then suspended the meeting in his personal capacity, while expelling eight executive committee members of the student union. These eight expelled people were the representatives that Wu invited to participate in the joint meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e83">West Qing Basketball Tournament Begins on the 17th of this Month <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The first week's schedule is arranged. A total of 32 teams have registered to participate in the third West Qing Basketball Tournament. The Basketball Committee decided the night before last (Monday) to increase Group A to 14 teams and Group B to 16 teams, divided into two groups for competition. This is due to the limited time left in the gymnasium, so there is this restriction. The team names in Group A are Shanghai Jiang Labor, Qingguang, Zhenru, McKinley, Yeshi, John, Red Team, Huadong, Chizhi, Zhonggong, Jiangwan, West Qing Love, West Qing Pi, etc., a total of 14 teams. The team names in Group B are (Group B, First Group) Rowing, Tongwen, Nanfang, Shanghai Law School, Qiyang, Jewish, Yu Guang, (Group B, Second Group) American Children's School, Lianti, Fudan Middle School, Taxation, John Middle School, Nanlu, Shanghai Jiang Attached Middle School, Evening Star. The competition method is 18 minutes per half in Group A and 15 minutes in Group B. Sometimes only half a game is played, and the second half is played the next day or another day. This method has been practiced in the Americas for a long time and is considered very convenient. Also, Group A decided to compete with each other once with Group B. The Group B championship will be determined by the champion of Groups B 1 and 2 in a three-game two-win system. The opening date and competition are scheduled to begin on the evening of the 17th of this month.

<p>Speaker (speaking in public): We are born in this world and must use our own strength to deal with everything. We must never rely on others. Therefore, whenever something comes to you, you must do it yourself.</p>
<p>A listener (standing up and questioning): Sir, then when your hair grows, do you cut and groom it yourself?</p>
<p>A: I think talking is the cheapest thing in the world, and it doesn't cost any money.</p>
<p>B: Who told you that talking costs money?</p>
<p>A: The day before yesterday, I went to see a lawyer to discuss something, and he actually asked me for five taels of silver for the conversation fee. Shanghai is really unaffordable to live in.</p>
<p>A: Military officer, I heard that you have experienced hundreds of battles and were able to return safely thanks to being rescued by an enemy officer. Is that true?</p>
<p>B: Military officer: Yes, that's right.</p>
<p>A: Military officer: This enemy officer is very respectable. I wonder what the situation was like.</p>
<p>B: Military officer: I took the initiative to kill him first, and he didn't have time to kill me, so he saved my life. A: I had to buy everything myself before I got married.</p>
<p>B: What happened now that you're married?</p>
<p>A: My wife buys and uses everything, and I don't even have money to buy anything myself.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Birthdays and National Humiliation <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>It has been sixty-four years since the birth of the Premier. Today is the Premier's birthday. If there had been no Premier's birth on this day, then our Chinese compatriots would still be oppressed under the autocratic government of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. The country would not be a country, and the people would not be the people, not knowing where to turn. Therefore, it goes without saying that today is a day worthy of our celebration. Recalling the Premier's lifelong energy devoted to the revolutionary cause, running for forty years, experiencing ten failures, but his will was not diminished. By knowing before others, awakening those who know later, and awakening those who awaken later, we were able to understand the corruption of the Qing government and the awesomeness of imperialism. A group rose up in revolution, and the Republic of China was established.</p>
<p>Today, we only know it as the Premier's birthday, but we do not know that it is also a period of national humiliation. In the Sino-Japanese War, the old and large China was defeated by the small Eastern Neighbor. As a result, our country's weakness was completely exposed. Seeing that Japan had gained considerable benefits, various countries greatly advocated their open-door policy and the principle of equal benefit, and all came to seize various rights. First, Russia, having threatened the return of Liaodong with success, again cited the previous example and demanded land from our country as a reward. The Qing government did not dare to refuse and sent Li Hongzhang to Russia, allowing Russia to have railway construction rights and mining rights in the three eastern provinces, and to lease Jiaozhou Bay as a naval port. Unexpectedly, the matter was learned by the Germans, who used the killing of German missionaries in Caozhou, Shandong, as a pretext to suddenly send warships to Jiaozhou Bay and forcibly lease it for a period of ninety-nine years, and obtain the construction rights of the Jiaoji Railway and mining rights within a hundred miles along the road. Russia's Jiaozhou Bay was occupied by Germany, so it revised a new treaty with our country and forcibly leased Lushun and Dalian for a period of twenty-five years. The British advocated the principle of naval equality and demanded the lease of Weihaiwei for a lease period similar to Lushun and Dalian. The French followed the example of the French and Germans, sending warships into Guangzhou Bay and forcibly leasing it for a lease period similar to Jiaozhou Bay. The British, seeing this, again used the excuse of the balance of power to demand the lease of land opposite Hong Kong to expand the old occupied Kowloon. The lease period was also like Guangzhou Bay. Since then, important ports have been leased by foreigners, and the national defense has been unable to be completely secure.</p>
<p>The day of the signing of the Guangzhou Bay treaty was the twelfth day of the eleventh month of the twenty-fifth year of Guangxu. It is a bay in the South China Sea, east of the Leizhou Peninsula. The entrance to the bay has Zhanchuan Island, dividing the mouth into two, a natural formation. However, the port is narrow and difficult to accommodate large ships. In the twenty-fourth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, it was occupied by the French. In the twenty-fifth year, a treaty was signed allowing it to be leased for a period of ninety-nine years. Now it is directly under the supervision of the Annam Governor-General. Therefore, today is both the Premier's birthday and the anniversary of the national humiliation of the Guangzhou Bay lease. We should not forget national humiliation while celebrating.</p>
<h3 id="e92">The Same Kind of Playing <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Rizhang said one day that foreigners often develop a fondness for sports, while Chinese people think that scholars should be gentle and refined, so they often cannot sustain their energy after middle age. Foreigners, because they have the habit of sports, still play golf in their old age even if they cannot do strenuous exercise. Chinese old people, however, go to play mahjong. The same kind of playing shortens the lives of Chinese people considerably.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Mourning the Passing of Tian Ziqin, a Disciple of the Law <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Wuwei Anzhu</p>
<p>Mr. Tian Ziqin of Qichun, named Tong, was famous throughout the world. I first met him at the seat of Mr. Pang Qingcheng of Wuxing. In the early summer of last year, Elder Qing invited us to a gathering at his Shanghai residence. Besides Mr. Tian, those present included Chen Shaobai, Xu Jingren, Shi Yiting, Hu Puan, and Ye Huijun. Mr. Tian's eloquence was particularly strong. After the banquet, he still spoke at length about national affairs, saying that he would vow to save the country with writing and mentioned plans to publish the Taiping Magazine. Later, I had the occasion to be invited to see him on several matters, and we visited each other frequently. In the third month of late spring, I had just returned to Shanghai from Qingdao and met Elder Qing. He told me that Mr. Tian had been admitted to the hospital with severe abdominal pain. The doctor diagnosed the disease as cancer. Both the late Premier and Liang Rengong, as well as Fa Nala Weng, all died from this incurable disease. Furthermore, great men and writers of China and the West have often lost their lives to this disease. Could it be that excessive mental effort and anxiety have led to this illness?</p>
<p>Elder Qing once showed me Mr. Tian's written description of his illness, written while he was in the hospital. At that time, because the pain was unbearable, he was reluctant to speak and used writing instead. It is what is now printed in the obituary. Elder Qing also said that Mr. Tian's illness had improved slightly, and the doctor said there were signs of recovery, but it was aggravated by overeating, which ultimately harmed his life. It is truly regrettable. I recall that when Su Manshu was ill, Elder Qing said that he also visited him every day. One day, there were signs of recovery, but the illness worsened and he died due to dietary indiscretion. Although the great events of life and death seem to be predetermined, one must be cautious about illness entering through the mouth. Whenever I think of the saying that "talented writers often have unfortunate lives, and demons like to harass people who are too clever," I cannot help but sigh for him.</p>
<p>On the second day of this month, Mr. Tian's family and friends held a memorial service for him at Chongfa Temple in Shanghai. I drove there at eleven o'clock. Mayor Zhang Yuejun came to offer condolences on behalf of the National Government, wearing only casual clothes. When I entered, I did not have time to sign my name because of the crowd. I saw a woman in plain clothes, about forty years old, standing beside the coffin. Her expression was very sad. A certain gentleman told me that this was Madam Juésheng, and she was also a grieving person. The hall was the temple's guest room. A lifelike portrait of Mr. Tian was hung in the center. The outer periphery of the colorful flower pavilion was adorned with fresh flowers, interspersed with yellow and white autumn chrysanthemums, which added to the faint purity and strength of character, just like Mr. Tian's personality. A white cloth curtain was hung outside, with a horizontal plaque with the four characters "Sound of Autumn Still There." Above the plaque was a couplet from the National Government: [Integrity unmatched, morality and economics unmatched] If Heaven had granted him more years, he would have surely made rain for the people. A biography in Confucian circles, a biography as a literary knight-errant. The public is originally immortal, willing to grow old in poverty on the Huangpu River.] The words are truly appropriate, and the parallelism between "the people" and "the Huangpu River" is also skillful. The blue satin memorial banners from Chairman Chiang were hung on the left and right sides of the couplet, with [Great Aspirations and Extraordinary Talent] on the left and [Name Survives Immortality] on the right. Chairman Chiang's elegiac couplet was hung on the large pillar, [Revolution promoted the enlightened, writing strategies for peace.] I deeply regret that Mr. Tian's self-edited Taiping Magazine was discontinued after three issues. Now that Mr. Tian is gone, there will be no one who can tell the revolutionary anecdotes recorded in Taiping that Mr. Tian had in his heart. In addition, there were thousands of elegiac couplets and memorial banners, with no space left in the two side rooms from the temple gate to the left and right of the altar. The sounds of drums and music in the hall competed to play mournful tunes that echoed around the beams. The plain carriages and white horses were endless, unable to overcome the pain of the loss of both the person and the music.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Impressions of West Lake <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>(6) Wisdom Sword</p>
<p>The boat arrived at Pinghu Qiuyue. After landing, I walked along the west road and arrived at Luoyuan, where the National Academy of Art is located. I sent a note asking someone to show me around. A certain gentleman in the academy guided me through the various studios. Among the teachers, I admired a large oil painting by Lin Fengmian. It was wide, about the size of a hall, and depicted several peasant women and children, each with a look of hesitation on their faces. Lin's paintings are majestic and colorful, and this painting is especially sufficient to express his character. The academy building is very simple, but the workmanship and materials seem to be quite expensive. It originally belonged to the British couple Hartung. Today, the National Academy of Art uses it. Leaving Luoyuan, I took a walk through the Wenlan Pavilion and Zhongshan Park. After the park is Gushan. I climbed it and looked out at the outer lake, the atmosphere was refreshing and incomparable. Passing Zhongshan Park, I arrived at Xiling Seal Society. As soon as I entered, I smelled the strong fragrance of osmanthus. My sleeves smelled as if there was a clear fragrance assaulting me. At the Seal Society, I bought a box of seal ink. I went further to the Sizhao Pavilion. This is the highest point on Gushan. I drank tea here for a while. The lake view was on the table, making me reluctant to leave. Behind the pavilion, on the cliffs, a small bronze statue of Mr. Wu Changshuo is planted, with many inscriptions by celebrities on both sides. Leaving Xiling Seal Society, I went to Guanghua Temple to see the Liuquan Spring. A porter followed me, asking if I would like to visit the Yue Temple. He also persuaded me to have a drink at Lou Wai Lou. I disliked it and ordered him to take me to the pier in front of Yue Temple. I would then take a boat to visit Yuquan.</p>
<p>Qinglian Temple is located north of Xiangu Mountain. Yuquan is inside it. I took a rickshaw there in the evening. After entering the mountain gate, I saw a light cloud filling the mountain like smoke, gently rippling. The mountain road was extremely desolate. There were many ruins and tombs on both sides. The rickshaw puller was old and panted as he walked. I stopped him from going further. It seemed that there was an old man directing the masons to repair the wall in the cemetery of the painter Tao Yuanqing. Going further, I saw a tomb with the words "Tomb of Lin Xiaohong of Xiapu" written on the stele. Hundreds of years later, this may be comparable to the tomb of Su Xiaoxiao. After walking for about two miles, I arrived at a mountain gate. There was a pile of incense ashes, forming a small mound in the forest. It was burned, so from a distance, there was a light cloud of mist. I was speechless. After entering the temple, I visited Yuquan Pond. There were several houses around the pond, built with funds from Cen Chunxuan. Schools of goldfish swam back and forth in the pond. Most of them were black and several feet long. I asked the monks for bread crumbs and threw them into the water. They all kissed the surface, fighting to be the first to disappear in a flash. The words "Fish Cloud Country" were engraved on the wall, and a couplet by Xun Lu was hung on the pillars of the pavilion: "Fish and people share the spring's clarity, hearts share the spring's purity." This spring originates from the West Mountain, flowing underground for dozens of miles, and only appears here in its true form, which is very clear. Behind the courtyard, there is also a Fine Rain Spring. It is named because the spring water is ejected under the surface of the water, splashing like rain. Yuquan Watching Fish, one of the twenty-four scenic spots of West Lake, is also located here. I took a short tour and left. After passing the mountain gate, I looked back at the mountain clouds, which were still thick on the edge of the forest. I returned to Yue Temple, and it was already dusk. Since I had to leave Hangzhou the next day, I still lingered for the scenery of the lake and mountains. I ordered the boatman to slowly swing out of Yudai Bridge, follow the west bank, turn into Su Causeway, Su Causeway and then circle the west of Santan Yingyue (Three Pools Mirroring the Moon), pass the Huxin Pavilion, and return. The boatman seemed quite surprised by my recklessness. I rewarded him with wine money, and he happily wielded the oar and returned. When I arrived at Lakeside Park, there were thousands of lights. I quietly stood by the lake and blew a kiss to this silver West Lake from afar. The evening mountains were silent, the stars and moon were bleak, as if they all had a feeling of regret at parting.</p>
<p>I only got four poems on this trip, which are not very good. I will record them here to end this article: "Hate the delicate sun in autumn, it seems like spring is coming. The boat rides the wind and is full of the lake. Outside the Qianwang Temple, the willows droop. Even if you don't hear the warblers, it's still pleasant." (The Liulang Wenying, the willow waves and singing orioles, one of the ten scenes of West Lake is next to the Qianwang Temple.) "Holding each other slightly drunk in the night hall, the pressing oars and wind are still sadly cool. Are the lights of the wine shop still there on the way home? The moon is like frost on the west side of Broken Bridge." "Forming a bamboo forest beside the mountain, the car stopped at Longhong's second home. I can't forget a dream until now. Buy Hangzhou tea at the fifth watch." "The feelings of youth are like orchids and sandalwood. Seeing the Mid-Autumn Festival moon in a foreign land, the ruined promise of ten years in a white house. The lights around the building fill the cold lake."</p>

<p>Chapter 15: Sighing at Love in All Directions, Enamored of Greenery in the Room</p>
<p>After Long Ziyun and others ordered the dishes, Ling Zhixiang was the first to suggest calling for companions. The hosts naturally had to agree. Fortunately, both of these companions had their own companions. The waiters brought over the name-calling plates, and Lin Fanzi, who had excellent handwriting, picked up a brush soaked in ink and said, "Tell me your names, and I'll write them down." Knowing that Ling Zhixiang had the most companions, he immediately wrote down four or five of them that he knew. Ling Zhixiang said, "That's too many. Three would be enough." Lin Fanzi said, "Calling for companions isn't just for yourself. It's also for others to see. This is a bit of public accountability. You have a lot of resources anyway, so call a few more for us to appreciate." Ling Zhixiang said, "Calling more is okay, but you have to consider the order." Saying that, he took the stack of name-calling tickets from Lin Fanzi and examined them himself, laughing as he said, "There are so many tricks to calling for companions?" Lin Fanzi said, "There are a lot of tricks to calling for companions, especially with these five tickets of his. They have to be sent out in two groups. It's probably a matter of avoiding each other's faces, like Yin and Xing. The two sides can't meet. If they meet, it'll start a sour wind, so he makes them come one before the other. Is that the idea? But usually, just calling for companions wouldn't cause jealousy issues. It must be that the two are close friends, so that's why he does it this way." Ling Zhixiang hurriedly defended, "No, no. If I called them all at once, they would all come at the same time, causing a commotion for a while, and then scatter. It would be meaningless. And they're all little sisters that everyone knows. After they meet, they only talk about what clothes are the most fashionable, what kind of bangs look best, where you bought your shoes, and whether your diamond rings have been re-minted. Questions like that would come up endlessly, leaving the guests out of the loop, as if the two groups were called specifically for them to talk. What's especially annoying is that they act like a group of friends playing charades, stretching out two fingers, three fingers, asking, 'Is he coming?' No one knows what the 'second' or 'third' they're hinting at means. Calling them to come and make a phone call for me, so I specifically separated the order." Lin Fanzi laughed, "What you say sounds reasonable, but in reality, that's not the case. This is your tactic. Don't think I don't know. People say that two heroes can't stand side by side, so in national politics, to put it nicely, it's called unification. Unification means that one is supreme. It's just that two heroes can't stand side by side. If they stand side by side, they're bound to compete. Women are the same. The so-called 'beautiful women refuse to yield' is just that two females can't stand side by side. If they stand side by side, they're bound to compete. This is a kind of instinct. You treat the ladies in your home the same way."</p>

<h3 id="e96">Commercial News: Finance and Gold Market on the Rise <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>From hovering to moving forward, the gold price yesterday, the 11th, rose sharply. However, there was a rotation of one or two taels in the pre-market and post-market. The daily calculation showed a difference of two taels. Buyers were willing to be active. However, the teller transactions of each bank in the morning tended to be hesitant to buy and sell. Both spot and forward exchange rates rose. Banks all had forward selling. Transactions in the market, such as Yu Maoyong, Rendecheng, and Wupin, had already bought, while Yuancheng, Yongfuyu, Taikang, Zifengyong, etc., were selling short positions. The overseas silver market was extremely flat, which seemed to cause the gold price to fall slightly in the morning. Although it was sometimes fluctuating later, it did not exceed two taels. Later in the market, Dadecheng and Wupin continued to buy. The exchange rate had been reduced by half a point. The industry was still scrambling, which made the atmosphere more acute. The gold price went straight through the clouds and rose to more than 89 taels. Rumors that cash may be unbanned aroused the psychology of the general public. Especially for silver bars, there should be a possibility of decline.</p>
<p>Fluctuating and hovering since the beginning of the morning, the opening price of the December gold price fell slightly by 0.4 taels to 984 taels and 9 qian (gross price was around 85 taels). The recent price of large bars did not change, and the distant price was low by 1/16. The silver price was as before, so people's hearts seemed to be sluggish. Later, Dadecheng, Zifengyong, Wupin, etc. all competed to buy, and it had already jumped up by one or two taels to 86 taels and 45 qian. Not long after, Yuan Maoyong and others sold, suppressing it slightly by more than one tael, estimated at 85 taels and 45 qian. The exchange industry had been settling the exchange of two wells. The December Citibank opened at 39.125 yuan, and the Huayi Huabi opened at 0.2 at 1.73125 for English gold in December. The price was set at 5 taels. The price remained unchanged and hovered inside and outside 5 taels. However, the internal price of the gold purchased by each company was not very different. December can be done in and out at 1.73125 to 1.75, and January at 1.7275. The appreciation of goods in the market is still strong. After 10 o'clock, it rose to 86 taels. After entering, Hengxing Dakang Xieyu and others came to sell it. In addition, Sumitomo sold 1 tael and 2 qian and 6.75 of Japanese gold in January. Maihang sold English gold for 1.72125 in the current month, so the exchange market was not tight, and it had fallen back by 1 and a half taels. At 10:50, it was 88 taels and 5 qian. After 11 o'clock, it seemed to be rising. Only a few rotated, but there was no change, so it stood at 85 taels. At 11:15, it was raised from 4 taels and 78 qian to 5 taels and 56 qian. Wupin still belonged to procrastination. By the time the market closed at noon, it was 5 taels. After the restoration, it was made again at 45 qian. The revealing price was still calculated at 619 taels and 8 qian. The initial touch was at 35 taels, and then 345 taels.</p>
<p>A group replenished the short positions and rose. The afternoon opened at 86 taels and 2 qian. Yuancheng Yong and others bought in, and then Dadecheng also entered. It was heard that the Indian exchange was low, and people's hearts rose immediately. It continued to rise by more than 2 taels to 80 taels and 45 qian. The exchange market was also firm. Mitsui sold 1 tael and 2 qian and 7 minutes of Japanese gold in December. HSBC Mitsui mutually made the current US dollar at 39 yuan. At 2:30, it decreased slightly by 1 tael to 7 taels and a half. After that, it still looked high. Maihang and others sold English gold in December, calculated at 1.725 in January, 3125. It was pulled in by Yufeng Yongjin. Then it added more than 1 tael. At 2:45, it was heard that HSBC had changed the brand name by half a point. The first order was 1.25 US dollars, 0.25 Japanese gold plus 0.75. People's hearts were particularly strong, and the market situation was unusually sharp. The buyer was still very active. After 3 o'clock, it reached 89 taels and 1 qian. However, Zifengyong and many long-term retail investors took this opportunity to sell, so it fell by more than 1 tael and 3:45. At 87 taels and 9 qian, it still soared again. Jingtai Hengyuan Dadecheng Chunfa Yong Wupin and others competed to buy. Especially the notes felt very short, and it boomed again by 1 tael and 56 qian. At 4:10, it reached 89 taels and 5 qian. After a while, it retreated by 1 tael, and the first order in November was still settled at 1.725. At 8:30, the market closed at 88 taels and 6 qian, an increase of 3 taels and 3 qian compared to the previous day. However, after the link was restored, it was collected to more than 9 taels. The maximum price for one day was 89 taels and 5 qian, and the minimum price was 84 taels and 5 qian, with a height difference of 5 taels. The revealed price has been changed to 623 taels and 4 qian. The daily gold is large and seven, and the small is pressed by 345 taels. The registered account is 94 taels to 85 taels, and the supplementary water is 94 taels to 98 taels. The early market for goods was 4 taels and 8 qian, the afternoon closing was 5 taels and a half, the afternoon was 6 taels and 2 qian, and the closing market was 9 taels and a half.</p>
<p>More coming in and out, and confusion. The transactions between peers were chaotic and at a loss. Yuan Maoyong, Dadecheng, Shunli, Huaixiang, Chunyuan Yong, and Tong Taichang all came in. Zifengyong, Yuanxing Yong, Yongfeng, Yu Da, had different ins and outs. Yuancheng Wupin had a lot of procrastination. In the afternoon, Decheng Taiheng Yuan Wupin all had purchases. Shunli, Zifengyong, Yifengyong, Yuan Maoyong, and exchange rate hedging all sold. Yuancheng Yong, Xieyu, Tong Taichang entered first and then exited. Because the 16th of this month happened to be a Sunday, the change was changed to the 15th. The transaction started at 8:30 that day. Because the current handover is winter, it was delayed by half an hour. Yesterday, the Dalian gang came in with a total of six or seven hundred bars and sold five or six hundred bars. A small number of Guang gangs came in and out.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Foreign Exchange Spot and Forward are Both Popular <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market was still peaceful, and the exchange rates had no honor or disgrace. The HSBC listings had no changes in each exchange in the morning. After 3 o'clock in the afternoon, it suddenly changed by half a point. The English gold was 1.25, which is now 1 shilling and 7 pence. The US dollar 25 is 38 yuan and 5. India shrank 75 to 106 Robi 5. The franc shrank 7 yuan to 978 yuan. The German exchange decreased by 1 yuan to 161 marks and 5 Dutch Yang decreased by half a yuan to 95 shields and a half. Singapore 1 tael is 146 taels and 5 qian. The Japanese exchange rate rose 75 to 2 qian and 9 points 25. Hong Kong is still calculated at 82 taels. As for the internal market, the afternoon was also tight. The trend of the gold market was high, reaching more than 89 taels. People's hearts were quite high. As a result, compared to the previous day, the English gold shrank 1.25, the US dollar shrank 1.875, and the Japanese gold rose by half a point, but not as popular as the gold market. However, in the Chinese gold industry, Yufeng Yong, Fuchang, Shengtai, and others bravely settled. However, banks were able to fully bear the sales, calculating that more than 300,000 pounds of English gold were transacted. From Well, Huabi Cuiyi, Xingye, Sumitomo, Datong, HSBC, Maihang, Dongya, etc. have all sold. The banks also mutually made more than 100,000 pounds. However, Sumitomo Yishi sucked in the current period. The US dollar has also been settled for 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. HSBC Shanghai and Sanbei have sold them. As for Japanese gold, it has also been bought for hundreds of thousands of yuan. Banks such as Sumitomo and Mitsui have provided it. Chinese merchants purchased exchange bills and hedged the gold price. Some did single transactions. Because they had great confidence, the silver market still had a bearish outlook.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Quiet and Weak Change <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The market overview has been calm for days due to stable market prices, so the transaction status is very indifferent. A desolate situation is quite silent. The status of collection and settlement of silver and money industries is also reduced compared with normal times due to the scarcity of supply and demand.</p>

<p>The recent 1996 Customs and Good-faith Bonds rose by approximately one yuan. Yesterday, the spot market situation for various public bonds still saw few trades despite multiple offers. The futures market was calmer than before, and both buyers and sellers seemed slightly less active than before. Although there was no development in the overall market atmosphere for the price trends of various bonds, the investing and buying trades of retail investors was quite active, buoyed by market optimism. As a result, the buying sentiment in the market was relatively dominant. Bond prices thus consistently rose, although the trends were generally quite steady. Except for recent 1996 Customs and Good-faith Bonds hovering around one yuan, other bonds only rose and fell by a few dimes. It is estimated that the total volume of spot trading for the day was only 8,000 yuan, while the total volume of futures trading was more than 7.2 million yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market is very weak, and a downward trend is gradually emerging. In reality, the sales of spot yarn are increasingly sluggish. No sector is showing excitement. With the northern regions about to freeze over, future yarn sales prospects are less promising, and there are concerns about increasing inventories. Therefore, Japanese merchants are heavily involved in long-term hedging. However, some near-month positions are being liquidated. Judging from the current state of the futures market, business stagnation may lead to drastic changes in the future. Most long-term contracts are expected to reach 145 taels.</p>
<p>The Human Standard Market is Weak. The opening of the Human Standard Futures Market saw a sharp drop in American cotton prices, leading to a lack of confidence and a weak market sentiment. Prices for all months fell by 0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 candareens. In the afternoon, news of sluggish spot yarn sales further weakened market sentiment, with near-term contracts falling by 0.6 and 0.9 candareens, and long-term contracts falling by 0.2 and 0.4 candareens. The total trading volume for the day was 13,450 bales. Sales included 1,950 bales from Yu Da, 850 bales from Yi Yu, 800 bales from Gong Tai, and the remaining 200-300 bales from others. Purchases included 700 bales from Da Feng, 550 bales from He Shen, 700 bales from Shen Chang, and the remaining 200-300 bales from others. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>The sharp decline in the cotton market is due to the sudden drop in American cotton prices, exceeding the gains of the past two days. This situation has increased the doubts of speculators, causing panic. Selling pressure is strong, leading to a market downturn. According to Japanese merchants, global commodity prices are falling, and cotton prices are relatively high. There are rumors that American cotton prices will continue to decline. However, some believe that the source of Hankou cotton is not smooth, and prices in various regions are holding up. There are still many who are betting on higher prices. The current situation is still holding firm. In general, the weakness of American and Indian cotton may lead to significant changes in the local market.</p>
<p>Standard Prices Fall by 0.03-0.04: The opening of the Hankou Standard Futures Market saw a sharp drop in American cotton prices, causing a lack of confidence. There was a shortage of actual users, and prices for all months fell by 0.03-0.04 candareens. In the afternoon, market sentiment was flat, with little fluctuation in prices. The total trading volume for the day was 40,600 dan. Sales included 2,900 dan from Ming Hua, 2,800 dan from Shen Da, 2,900 dan from Da Chang Cheng, and the remaining 1,500-1,600 dan from others.

<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the supply from various sectors turned scarce, with only twenty-odd firms selling. Due to the sharp decline, customers showed interest. Therefore, the price of new japonica rice held firm and was quite tight in the afternoon, generally rising by 0.03 taels. However, Beijing goods did not perform well, only slightly increasing by a fraction of a tael. Top-grade rice still opened at 15.7 yuan, and market conditions have become more active. Thin rice was tight, rising by 0.03-0.04 taels, with few arrivals, commanding a high price of 15.5 yuan. Early glutinous rice started flat, but due to customer enthusiasm, buying interest increased sharply, rising by 0.04-0.05 taels, with prices opening at 14.85 yuan. Du Jian rice also rose by about 0.5 taels, reaching a top price of 13.2-13.3 yuan. Wharf glutinous rice remained relatively stable, with higher-grade goods slightly declining by 0.01-0.02 taels. Currently, the glutinous rice market shows no signs of excessive decline. Bian Yuan rice saw strong buying interest, rising by 0.03-0.04 taels, reaching a high of 15.4 yuan.</p>
<p>Hu Nan: Yesterday, over twenty firms arrived from He Xia, but sales were extremely slow. Consequently, Chang Xi's new japonica rice performed poorly, with both high and low grades continuing to fall by a significant 0.5 yuan. Top-grade rice opened at 15 yuan, and Su Tong Bai rice also uniformly fell by 0.04-0.05 taels, truly due to a lack of interest. Examining this japonica rice market, it has gone from quiet to weak. However, the northern market turned upward in the afternoon, so today's market is bound to stabilize. Southern early rice also performed poorly. There were only sporadic transactions. Late rice trading was even more stagnant. However, boats arrived and sold quickly, with prices generally falling by 0.04 taels. Top-grade rice opened at around 15 yuan. Glutinous rice saw a strong rebound, rising by more than 0.05 yuan. The highest price only opened at 12 yuan, and the market was very soft. Bian Yuan rice continued to lack support, falling by 0.04-0.05 taels and dropping within the 14-yuan range.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Customer Sales are Very Stagnant <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign glutinous rice market was quiet. Foreign rice had long been sold out. The rice circulating in the market was all returned goods from customers. However, due to small inventories and significant price drops, they were unwilling to sell. Customer inventories were not large, and there was a slight expectation of new arrivals. However, customer interest was sluggish, and local merchants also had a supply of He Xia rice, so they were unwilling to inquire. Yesterday, Xiamen firms and others planned to suppress market prices, but there were no outright transactions in the market. However, it was heard that some transactions were arranged by brokers. The previous market had reduced prices somewhat. Customer and inventory arrivals were both low. Only Hunan firms continued to send telegrams to arrange shipments due to relatively favorable production prices. Yesterday, the market also traded Zhongguan Xiangji Yuan rice, 150 bags, priced at 13.5 yuan. There were no transactions for high-grade goods or Gan Yuan rice. The goods sold were divided between northern firms and local merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Flour Market Weak but Slightly Healthier <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Still Slightly Lower Than Yesterday's Closing Price: Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the sudden drop in foreign wheat prices by 1 yuan caused market sentiment to waver again. Speculators naturally became active again. Prices for all months were down 0.01-0.015 taels compared to the previous day. Although the environment was not good, major factories, having already made large disposals, shifted to a wait-and-see attitude. This was because excessive market declines actually raised concerns about sales, which was not beneficial for any factory. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, factory sentiment remained quiet, and inland sectors were absorbing supplies. The market trends for all contracts were stronger than in the morning but were still softer than the previous day's closing price. As a result, the current month was down 0.0025 taels compared to the previous day, December and January were down 0.01 taels, February was down 0.0075 taels, March was unchanged, and April was down 0.0075 taels. It is said that the standard opening price for the current month will be based on the sales of spot goods as a proportion. It is heard that [they] will start sampling immediately and also re-determine the grading to be followed by the factories.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a trend of near-term firmness and long-term stability in the morning and afternoon trading. Due to the lack of spot goods in the current month, speculators had no choice but to rely on foreign wheat to supplement their supplies. However, spot prices of high-quality wheat were not lower than 4.7-4.8 taels, so even with foreign wheat, it was similar to local wheat. This is why market sentiment has improved. As long-term prices for all months fell sharply, market sentiment turned weak. In the future, it is feared that the trend will be near-term firmness and long-term weakness. As a result, the current month was up by 0.02 taels compared to the previous day, December was up by 0.03 taels, January was down by 0.02 taels, and February, March, and April were down by 0.02 taels. The spot wheat market is trending towards a buying frenzy again. Although there were trades made throughout the city, none of the factories intended to participate. Open platforms saw Zhuang, Bengbu, Mingguang, and Yaowan Xianghe wheat, totaling over 5,000 bags, of which Shen Da and Hua Feng handled approximately 2,000 bags.</p>

<p>Celebration Held in the Morning, Entertainment Performed in the Afternoon. Today is the 65th Anniversary of the Birthday of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of the Chinese Nationalist Party. The Japanese Municipal Executive Committee has specially convened representatives from various organizations, groups, schools, and party branches at all levels to hold a commemorative meeting at the Gonghe Cinema on Minguo Road, South City, at 9:00 a.m. today. In the afternoon, entertainment will be performed at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. All sectors will display flags and close for one day to celebrate. The township areas will also hold commemorative ceremonies separately. The Municipal Executive Committee issued a notice to comrades yesterday, saying:</p>
<h3 id="e169">Today's Launching Ceremony of the Yixian Warship <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Designed According to the Latest Cruiser Design, the Seafarers Party Branch Issues a Notice to Fellow Compatriots. The Naval Department's Yixian warship is scheduled to hold a launching ceremony at 4:00 p.m. today. The Central Party Headquarters and the National Government have dispatched Commander Xiong Shihui of the Songhu Garrison to deliver a speech on behalf of the party, and Ms. Chen Shuying, the wife of Sun Zhesheng, has been invited to perform the bottle-breaking ceremony. Vice Minister Chen Shaokuan of the Naval Department came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to preside over all matters, and Chief of General Affairs Li Shijia and others also came to Shanghai yesterday morning. A summary of various aspects is provided below:</p>
<h3 id="e170">Today's Launching Ceremony of the Yixian Warship <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Order of Ceremony: (1) All take their seats; (2) Play music and sing the Party Anthem; (4) All bow three times to the National Party Flag and the Premier's Portrait; (5) The Chairman respectfully reads the Premier's Will; (6) Play music; (7) Conduct the Launching Ceremony; (8) The Chairman delivers the opening remarks; (9) The Representative of the Central Party Headquarters delivers an address; (10) The Representative of the National Government delivers an address; (11) The Representative of the Executive Yuan delivers an address; (12) Guests deliver speeches; (13) The Chairman responds; (14) Shout slogans; (15) Ceremony concludes; (16) Play music; (17) Take photographs; (18) Refreshments.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Ceremony Venue: The ceremony venue is on the right side of the Jiangnan Shipyard. A wooden platform was erected yesterday. The Naval Special Party Branch and the Naval Compilation Office were busy decorating everything. Both sides are filled with naval flags and slogans of various countries. In the center are the Party and National Flags and the Premier's portrait. In front of the platform is the bow of the Yixian warship, facing the platform, with a silver-gray hull and a reddish-brown bottom. It is larger than the Minquan and Yongshui warships, so the uppermost part of the bow protrudes beyond the top of the platform. Workers are busy with painting and other tasks. Vice Minister Chen Shaokuan of the Naval Department, Chief of General Affairs Li Shijia, and Chief of the Management Section Chen Jingxiang also inspected and provided instructions at the ceremony platform yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Various Aspects of the Yixian: The keel of the Yixian warship was laid on April 10th of this year and is scheduled to be completed in March of the 20th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1931]. The construction cost is estimated at 2.8 million yuan. The chief supervisor is Li Shijia, Chief of the General Affairs Department of the Naval Department. The supervisors are Wang Zhiguang, Lin Huiping, Chen Yaoping, Gao Chunmao, Gai Bangyue, etc. The warship is a light cruiser and will be assigned to the First Fleet. It is 270 feet long, 34 feet wide, and has a displacement of 1,550 tons. Its armament includes two 6-inch caliber guns, four 3-inch anti-aircraft guns, two 6-pound guns, and eight machine guns. Its coal capacity is 300 tons, its speed is 20 nautical miles per hour, and its cruising range is over 2,000 nautical miles. The crew consists of 160 personnel, and the captain is of the rank of lieutenant colonel. It is also equipped with the latest cruiser design, including accurate navigation instruments, combat command instruments, long and short-wave wireless telegraphs, wireless telephones, and powerful searchlights.</p>
<p>A Notice to Fellow Compatriots: As long as international wars cannot be absolutely eliminated, armaments are indispensable. Now, the scope of warfare, in addition to the mainland, requires a balanced development of naval, land, and air preparations. Although we cannot harbor any intention of aggression, passive self-defense must be the minimum preparation for an independent country. At present, our country's self-defense capabilities are far from our ideal standards, so we are not seeking freedom and equality, but the equipment of considerable military strength. Who can say that it is not a factual requirement? Just take naval defense as an example. From the mouth of the Yalu River in Andong, Liaoning, to the Beilun Estuary in Qinzhou, Guangdong, including more than 10,000 miles of coastline in the seven provinces of Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, the navy used to defend it has less than 50,000 tons and less than 100 ships. This is a problem that deserves the painstaking thought of our compatriots across the country in order to solve it. Since the National Revolutionary Army unified the country, our party has followed the Premier's will and strived for China's freedom and equality, first eliminating the rebels across the country to realize political tutelage. The naval authorities have adhered to this goal. In addition to participating in the anti-rebel work, they have also actively sought the development of naval construction. The Xianning, Yongshui, and Minquan warships have been completed previously, the Yixian warship was launched on the Premier's birthday, and the Minsheng warship has also begun construction. Under the current economic situation of extreme exhaustion, there are not many quantities and powerful constructions in fact, but the authorities' painstaking plans should win the sympathy and support of compatriots across the country. It is hoped that warships will continue to be launched in the future, and the tonnage will gradually increase to lay the groundwork for reaching our self-defense goals first. Dear compatriots, the need for the navy in our country and its past weakness are known to everyone. The launching of the Yixian warship can only be regarded as a meager supplement to healing this weakness. It is still hoped that everyone's enthusiasm will support and promote the continuous construction, so that this weak person can repeatedly have a large number of supplements and become strong, as a healthy maritime guarantee for our Chinese nation. Finally, our slogans are: Increase naval construction, consolidate our coastal defense! The Executive Committee of the Naval Special Party Branch.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Silk Factory Agreement to Resume Production <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Agreement Reached to Reduce Wages and Strive to Resume Production; 32 Factories Expected to Resume Production Before the 15th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factory Association stated that each factory had suffered drastic losses due to plummeting European sales, making it impossible to sustain operations. Consequently, except for Doung Gong silk factories and those already shut down, all 106 silk factories in Shanghai uniformly ceased operations at the end of last month. Over the past ten days, the livelihoods of more than 100,000 workers have been increasingly imperiled, resulting in a grave situation. As the representatives who went to Beijing to petition have now returned to Shanghai, an emergency meeting was convened for all industry members yesterday (the 11th) at 3 PM. Attendees included standing committee members Zhu Jing'an, Huang Jinfan, Zhang Peishen, Wang Xiaolai, and representatives from 93 silk factories, totaling about 100 individuals. Chairman Shen Huachen opened the meeting with customary rituals.</p>
<p>First, Wang Xiaolai (one of the petitioning representatives) reported on the petitioning process in Beijing, stating that the nine representatives from the three provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai first went to the National Government and the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 3rd, where they were met by secretaries. Then, they went to the Ministry of Finance, where they were received by Vice Minister Li Tiaosheng. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce was visited and personally received by Minister Kong, where each representative detailed the decline in European silk sales and the immense losses sustained by silk factories. The factories, unable to support themselves, had successively shut down throughout Shanghai, verging on bankruptcy. They requested that the government issue 10 million yuan in Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai silk industry public bonds within the year to provide relief. Ministers Li and Kong both agreed to do their utmost to find a way to comply. In Beijing, they hosted banquets for various heads of government agencies. As of yet, no official order has been issued, and a decision has not been made. They will go to Beijing again tomorrow to present a follow-up report. The report was followed by a proposal to discuss</p>
<p>The Issue of Resuming Production.</p>
<p>Manufacturers successively rose to report on the reasons for the shutdown: (1) European and American silk sales had reached an extreme point of stagnation, with silk prices being extraordinarily low. The cost of silk production was relatively high, resulting in a loss of over 200 taels of silver per bale of silk sold, depleting all capital. (2) Excessive burdens made it increasingly difficult to sustain operations. Thus, silk factories had no choice but to halt production. Chairman Shen stated, "Our country's manufactured silk is its largest foreign trade commodity. If all silk factories shut down, the silk market will stagnate. Our colleagues should find ways to maintain the inherent business of China's silk industry. I urge my colleagues to find ways to resume production as soon as possible to sustain the livelihoods of over 100,000 workers. As for reducing wages to alleviate the burden, the association is hesitant to propose this. Even if wages are reduced, without a source of raw materials, it will be difficult to resume production. What will we say in response to external criticisms? Moreover, it's easy to reduce wages but difficult to increase them. Workers may not be happy with this."</p>
<p>Subsequently, manufacturers from areas such as Hongkou reported that their district's silk factories had convened a joint labor-management meeting on the 7th of this month to discuss wage reductions. Workers understood the severe losses suffered by factories due to stagnant European silk sales, high costs, and low prices, and were very understanding of the difficult business conditions. They were willing to accept wage reductions, with all female workers' wages, staff salaries, and silkworm moth subsidies being paid at 80% of the original amount. Once the selling price of medium-grade silk reached over 1,000 taels, the original amount would be restored. Currently, factories were willing to pay female workers, who previously received 60 cents per day, 50 cents instead of the 48 cents after the 20% reduction. Workers in other districts, having been out of work for an extended period, expressed similar sentiments to help factories resume production as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The chairman then stated that the purpose of today's meeting was to discuss the resumption of production, focusing on whether or not it was possible. The issue of wage reductions should be addressed by each district convening its own labor-management meeting, working together in good faith. Those colleagues who could resume production immediately were asked to stand. At that time, only four factories stood: Fengtai (Zhabei District), Xinchang (Caojiadu), Lunyuan Fushen (Xinzha District), etc. The remaining Shunfeng (Zhabei District) and Anfeng (Xinzha) would restart machines tomorrow; Xiechang and Xiexing (Xinzha), Yingyu Fumin Baishi No. 1 and Baishi No. 2 (Zhabei) would restart on the 13th; Yufeng on the 14th; and Xinglun on the 15th. As for Yuanfeng (Hongkou), Xie'an (Zhabei), Tongwei Yujing (Hongkou), Jinyun (Xinzha), Yichang (Hongkou), Rui Heyu Kangxu and Lunxiang Qingfeng Hengkang Ruifengyu (Xinzha), Yongan Tongyi Qichang, etc., they needed to make preparations before choosing a date to resume production. Seven Doung Gong silk factories, except for Yonglun, would resume production today. Finally, representatives from the 32 silk factories that were resuming production continued to meet to discuss the procedures. It was resolved that workers' wages would be paid at 80% across the board. The workers would be notified of the resumption date in advance by the car operators. A notice detailing the losses incurred by the factories, necessitating compliance with the proposal to temporarily reduce wages for both male and female staff by 20%, would be posted in front of the factory. Female workers receiving 60 cents in wages would be paid 50 cents, and worker allowances, silkworm moth subsidies, etc., would be paid at 80% of the original amount to ensure everyone was aware. The meeting adjourned at 7 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Petitions to Change Year-End Closing Period <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Set for the Day Before the Start of Spring Each Year</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, requesting a change to the year-end closing date, stating that the current date poses difficulties for both agricultural and commercial circumstances. The petition, made on behalf of various trade associations, requested to change the year-end closing date to the day before the Start of Spring (Lichun Festival), to accommodate both the implementation of the national calendar and commercial considerations. The petition stated:</p>
<p>"Last year, the Commercial Consolidation Committee deliberated on amending the handling of merchants' accounts to adopt the national calendar, resolving to designate the end of May and the end of December of the national calendar as the closing periods. This was approved and submitted to the National Government for implementation nationwide. This year, the ends of May and September were handled accordingly. However, since the year-end closing date is very close, and because various industries have foreign account relationships, and since this is the initial implementation, preparations must be made in advance to avoid delays. The association issued early warnings and announcements to remind various industries. The Money Trade Association, the Coal Trade Association, and others also published notices urging foreign merchants to prepare early. On October 3rd, the association received a letter from the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce stating that because this is the initial implementation, it is difficult for various counties to achieve uniformity. If debts must be paid on schedule at the end of the year, but debts owed to them cannot be recovered, it would inevitably lead to financial strain. They requested that the closing period be extended by one and a half months, and so on. The Local Tea Trade Association of this city submitted a letter stating the same. The association replied that since the implementation of the national calendar has been repeatedly ordered and the decision has been made, it is not appropriate to make further changes. At that time, 39 county chambers of commerce in Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and other places gathered in Zhenjiang, the capital of Jiangsu Province, and resolved to submit a joint petition to the Provincial Government and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating that most of the new grain in the north and south of Jiangsu Province is still in the hands of farmers, and it is impossible to exchange grain for money to pay debts. It is impossible to close the accounts of rural stores, so how can the accounts of urban stores be settled? They requested to follow the example of the Jiangsu Province grain tax collection method, setting the deadline as the 16th day of the second month of the following year. The submitted draft was copied and sent for review. At the same time, the Bean and Rice Trade Association of this city also stated that new rice appears on the market in mid to late November, and the process of harvesting, drying, milling, and polishing rice from the countryside to the city and then to merchants cannot be completed in one or two months. Rice merchants must start accumulating stock between December and January. This is the time for various payments, not for collecting debts. They requested to set a separate accounting year for commercial affairs, with the end of January of the following year as the end of the previous year. Although this suggestion was rejected by your Bureau, various groups such as the Hat Shops, Fruit and Produce, Ginseng and Bird's Nest, Cosmetics, New Medicine, Shipping and Customs Clearance, Northern Goods, Firewood and Coal, and Paper Industries have all submitted letters stating their difficulties and requesting to review and change the method. The Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce also sent a letter to the association stating that commercial conditions there require a longer closing period and requested to convey this to silver and money industries, etc.</p>
<p>The association, occupying a leading position among merchants and acting as a conduit for communicating the hardships of merchants, must both implement national policies and not turn a blind eye to the difficulties faced by merchants. Since Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hangzhou have repeatedly expressed their concerns, and fearing that Shanghai's finances would be affected, the matter was brought up for discussion at the association's fifth standing committee meeting. Five inspectors were appointed to review the matter. The inspectors subsequently reported that although the decision to close accounts according to the national calendar cannot be changed, there is room to petition for modifying the date of the closing under the national calendar to better suit the needs of the business community. The inspectors noted that China is an agricultural country, and the national economy is tied to agricultural affairs. The association resolved that the previous dates of the end of May, the end of September, and the end of December for closing accounts were lacking in two aspects: (1) The original response to the Bureau of Social Affairs stated that the end of May was the time for silkworms and barley to appear on the market, and the end of September was the time for early rice to ripen. Both considered agricultural harvests, but the major closing period at the end of December did not. (2) If the end of December is the major closing period, then the first closing period from January 1st to the end of May is a full five months, the second closing period from June 1st to the end of September is four months, and the third closing period from October 1st to the end of December is only three months. This 5-4-3 system is too uneven. Although the Commercial Consolidation Committee had this method to wholeheartedly promote the national calendar, they had their own special difficulties. However, given the currently insurmountable difficulties that have arisen, it is necessary to seek remedies.</p>
<p>To remedy these practical difficulties, it is proposed to refer to the Bureau of Social Affairs' letter to the Commercial Consolidation Committee and divide the year into several periods according to the solar terms. The end of May, close to Lesser Fullness, and the end of September, close to Autumnal Equinox, should remain as the first and second closing periods. The commercial community's major closing period should be changed to the day before the Start of Spring each year. The reasons are as follows: (1) The Start of Spring is calculated according to the solar calendar and has no connection to the lunar calendar. (2) The Start of Spring is always on February 4th of the national calendar, and even if there is a change, it is on February 5th, differing by only one day. The dates can be calculated and determined. (3) Before the Start of Spring, agricultural harvests have long ended, and the income of farmers has been converted into cash. Whether in cities or towns, there are no issues with collecting and paying debts. (4) Setting February 4th as the major closing period would balance the lengths of the three closing periods, compensating for the excessive length of the first period and the excessive shortness of the second period. This was discussed at the association's sixteenth standing committee meeting on the 6th of this month and submitted to the sixth executive committee meeting. It was agreed that merchants' closing accounts are related to agricultural seasons, a point already understood by the municipal authorities. However, after reviewing the Bureau's rejection of the Bean and Rice Industry's petition, it was stated that the latest time for late rice to ripen is around the Frost's Descent solar term, and it has already been harvested. However, in reality, the majority of late rice has not yet been harvested after the Frost's Descent has already passed. Moreover, due to continuous rain, the weather has not cleared, and it is reported that late rice has been damaged and rice prices have risen. Therefore, the Bean and Rice Industry Association's statement that agricultural crops appear on the market in mid to late months is more accurate. As for changing the closing date of the commercial community to abolish the custom of the national calendar, the Start of Spring is on February 4th or 5th of the national calendar, with a fixed date. The national calendar New Year's Eve and the Start of Spring are not adjacent. Even taking this year as an example, there are more than ten days between them. Although the dates of the end of May and the end of September under the national calendar are not very far from the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival, respectively, there is no risk of mistaking them as variations of the Dragon Boat Festival or the Mid-Autumn Festival. The reasons are the same. Moreover, Jiangsu Province also sets February 16th of the following year as the deadline for collecting grain taxes. Since the government must consider the capacity of the entire population when collecting taxes and does not limit the end of the year as the major closing date, there is no hindrance to the implementation of the national calendar within a reasonable range, and the deadline can be extended to avoid many conflicts and financial impacts. It was resolved to submit a request to the municipal authorities to forward it to the government for approval and record. This would be beneficial to the public. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs."</p>
<p>It is also reported that the association believes the closing issue needs to be resolved urgently as the end of the solar year is approaching and has separately sent a telegram to the State Council's Ministry of Industry and Commerce requesting approval and recording of this method.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Envoys to Visit Capital Tomorrow Evening to Attend Celebration of Victory Over Rebellion <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Envoys in Beijing Scheduled to Travel South Today</p>
<p>Increased Number of Representatives in Shanghai</p>
<p>French Envoy and Others Already in Capital Yesterday</p>
<p>The National Government will hold a celebration rally on the 14th to commemorate the victory over the rebellion. Envoys from various countries stationed in Shanghai have made preparations to travel to the capital tomorrow evening to participate. This was briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has been learned that envoys from various countries stationed in Beijing will also travel south today, hosted by the Archives Preservation Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing. The number of representatives from various countries stationed in Shanghai has also increased. The Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, Chen Shiguang, has reserved two chartered carriages with the Railway Bureau to host the envoys' trip to the capital. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Envoys in Beijing to Travel South: The victorious conclusion of the campaign against the rebellion, the reunification of the country, and the general jubilation for peace have been met with heartfelt congratulations from the envoys in Beijing, according to Qi Dapeng, Director of the Archives Preservation Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The envoys will travel south via the Pingpu Railway today, hosted by Director Qi Dapeng. They include the Dutch Envoy Oudenkoden, the Danish Envoy Kofod, the Belgian Envoy Walroen, and the Swedish Chargé d'Affaires Lei Yaowude.</p>
<p>Increased Number of Representatives in Shanghai: Those from the Shanghai envoys who are scheduled to visit the capital tomorrow evening include the American Envoy Johnson, the French Envoy Wilden, the Norwegian Envoy Aubert, the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu, the Turkish Chargé d'Affaires Forde, the Polish Counselor Kleczynski, and the Finnish Chargé d'Affaires Wemiki, from seven countries. In addition, the Cuban Envoy Pietra, the British Representative in Shanghai Counselor Ingelram, Counselor Sivitges, and the Czech Representative Stephen are also scheduled to visit the capital tomorrow evening. Director Chen from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has reserved two carriages with the Railway Bureau for the envoys to use.</p>
<p>French Envoy Entered Capital Yesterday: French Envoy Wilden, having been in contact with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding an audience with Chairman Chiang to present his credentials, entered the capital yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM aboard the French flagship Longshan, ahead of the other envoys. He was accompanied by Counselor Shawa and Secretary Du Keller.</p>
<p>Five Officials Departed First: The French Consulate's Military Attaché Kesville, after visiting the Gaochang Temple and the Shanghai Arsenal, also visited the Hongqiao Airport yesterday morning. In the afternoon, he paid a visit to the Songhu Garrison Commander, Xiong Shihui, and was therefore unable to join the French Envoy on the same ship. He entered the capital last night with the French Consulate's Counselor Li Bi, the Japanese Consulate's Commercial Counselor Yokotake Heitaro, First Secretary Horiuchi Kanjyo, and attendant Kurozumi Akio.</p>

<h3 id="e176">The General Headquarters for the Suppression of Bandits in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Ordered to Temporarily Postpone Dissolution <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Continuing Past Achievements...Striving to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>In May of this year, Xiong Shihui, the Songhu Garrison Commander, was ordered by Commander-in-Chief Chiang to concurrently take charge of bandit suppression affairs in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. After assuming the position of General Commander, Xiong, recognizing the vastness and complexity of the three provinces, first initiated an investigation. Upon completion of the investigation, he convened a meeting of the bandit suppression officials from the three provinces to discuss bandit suppression plans. At that time, the military situation at the front was tense, and the number of troops available for bandit suppression was very limited. Xiong's 5th Division was also transferred to the front lines for combat. However, major bandit groups, such as Ma Yuren's gang in the Rugao and Yancheng areas of Jiangsu Province, Hu Gongmian's gang in the Wenchang and other regions of Zhejiang Province, Taibao Ashu's gang in the Jiahu and other regions, and Gao Jingqi's gang in the Yinghuo and Luan areas of Anhui Province, were successively suppressed.</p>
<p>Recently, with the conclusion of the anti-rebellion military campaign and the successive return of troops to the provinces, Xiong submitted a request to the General Headquarters to dissolve the General Headquarters for the Suppression of Bandits in the three provinces. Yesterday, the Headquarters issued a directive stating that during the anti-rebellion military campaign, bandits and communists in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui took the opportunity to secretly cause trouble. Fortunately, the General Commander planned carefully and was able to quell the unrest. Now that the troops have gradually returned, the General Commander is expected to continue his past achievements and strive to suppress the remaining scattered bandits in the three provinces. The request to dissolve the General Headquarters for the Suppression of Bandits is temporarily deferred.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Chinese Shipping Industry Agreed on Methods for Preventing Banditry on River Vessels <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Banditry Rises in Upper Reaches</p>
<p>Repeated Attempts to Rob Thwarted</p>
<p>Request Warships Patrol to Protect Shipping</p>
<p>Recently, as Chinese ships have begun to resume sailing along the Yangtze River, there have been frequent reports of bandit activity in the upper reaches. River vessels have been shot at and shelled by bandits. Foreign merchant ships have the protection of foreign warships, allowing them to navigate the river, but Chinese ships are in grave danger during this shallow water period. Yesterday, various Chinese river shipping companies in Shanghai, seeking to ensure navigational safety and protect the lives and property of passengers, telegraphed headquarters requesting that the Navy dispatch naval vessels to various locations along the upper reaches to patrol the waterways. The details of this situation are described below:</p>
<p>Bandit Demonstration at Huangsang Estuary: Bandits have resurfaced near the Huangsang Estuary above Daye, aiming to rob merchant ships. These bandits have large numbers and are equipped with guns and cannons. Last week, they opened fire on the Japanese Qing and Taikoo river vessels. Fortunately, these foreign ships were protected by naval personnel and were not successful. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jianghua vessel also encountered the same danger while traveling upstream. Yesterday, according to a telegram from the ship's owner, Huang Muzong, the bandits fired eight cannon shots in rapid succession. The ship had no escorting troops, making future voyages extremely dangerous. It is imperative to request the Navy to suppress the bandits, or it will greatly affect navigation.</p>
<p>Upper Yangtze to Suspend Night Navigation: The Taikoo Company's Wuchang vessel also encountered a large group of bandits near Huangzhou. The bandits fired four cannon shots at the ship. Although the ship had naval personnel who fired back with machine guns, the number of bandits was too large, and they were scattered along the river. The ship's captain ordered all lights to be turned off completely to reduce the target for the bandits. The Wuchang vessel was able to escape this danger by traveling quickly through the night. Chinese river vessels traveling on the Upper Yangtze have agreed to temporarily suspend night navigation near Shashi, Chenglingji, and Huangsang Estuary to prevent banditry. This will be until protective measures are in place.</p>
<p>Request for Naval Escort: The owners of the Chinese river vessels, such as the Emei, sailing on the Upper Yangtze, telegraphed Shanghai, stating that the bandits' attempts to rob ships made navigation extremely dangerous. The telegram stated: "Bandits are rampant in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and ships traveling up and down the river are frequently shot at or even shelled, making navigation extremely dangerous. Moreover, with the arrival of winter, the water is shallow, and the channels in the Yangtze gorges are constantly changing, causing many ships traveling up and down the river to be afraid to travel at night and must anchor. Without naval protection, it is difficult to find a suitable location, and there is a risk of being kidnapped for ransom. For the sake of the safety of the lives and property of all Chinese and foreign merchants, we request that you forward this request to the headquarters, urging the Navy Department to promptly dispatch several warships to patrol the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, such as the Chenglingji and Shashi areas, and to provide advance notice of naval vessel mooring locations at night and all emergency call signs to facilitate merchant ships approaching the warships and anchoring for protection to avoid danger." (omitted below)</p>
<p>Shipping Merchants Telegraph Government Officials: Shanghai shipping merchants believe that the safety of navigation is crucial to the resumption of regular Chinese river vessel services. Currently, each river vessel only has four officers and soldiers, and their task is to maintain order within the ship rather than preventing banditry. Therefore, the Navy should dispatch warships to suppress bandits along the river to ensure the safety of travelers. Regarding the river vessel owners' request to dispatch warships, it is reported that a telegram has been sent to the National Government requesting that the Navy Department implement this immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e181">The Low-Priced Rice Sales Committee Sells Over 78,000 Shi of Rice <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Each Shi Loses Approximately 1.4 Yuan</p>
<p>Accounts to be Announced After Meeting</p>
<p>The Municipal Low-Priced Rice Sales Committee, overseen by the Municipal Government, hired people from all walks of life to procure large quantities of rice for sale at low prices to alleviate the living conditions of ordinary people. Ten distribution points were established in the north and south of the city in May of this year, and one was established in each of the rural districts to prevent ordinary people from suffering from high rice prices. By the end of September, the price of rice fell with the arrival of the new rice harvest, and the sales were discontinued. The total amount of rice sold was over 78,000 shi, costing 1.2 million yuan. The total expenses and losses on rice amounted to 110,000 yuan. Each shi lost an average of 1.4 yuan (compared to the historical average of 2 yuan per shi). The loss was covered by a 10,000-yuan subsidy from the Municipal Government and over 23,000 yuan from local grain reserves. The remaining amount was raised by the committee through donations from all walks of life. The committee's accounts are scheduled to be approved and reported at a meeting on the 13th, and the accounts will be formally announced.</p>

<p>Wording to be Amended Today</p>
<p>Contract to be Formally Signed</p>
<p>The case of the seamen requesting a wage increase from various foreign shipping companies has been resolved after previous negotiations. The Taikoo Company has accepted the request and drafted a wage increase contract. However, the seamen objected to the clause stating that there would be no further wage increases. After mediation by Yu Qiaqing, the Taikoo Company agreed to remove this clause. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company sent a letter to the Seamen's Union requesting representatives to come to the company today to amend the contract for signing and implementation of the wage increase plan. The union has appointed committee members Wang Yongsheng and Liu Yuzhou to represent the seamen at the company today to amend and formally sign the contract. It is also expected that Jardine Matheson, Nissin and other companies will follow the Taikoo Company's example and increase wages.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Continued Report on the Shinfong Collision Case <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Shinfong steamer was damaged by the Japanese vessel Keizan Maru at Lutsuchuang, Tanggu, as previously reported. Further details are as follows:</p>
<p>Inspection Upon Arrival in Tianjin: After the collision, the Shinfong steamer sailed to Tianjin. The shipowner, Masun, reported the incident to the Tianjin Customs, which dispatched the River Transportation Department to inspect the vessel. The inspection revealed that the damaged parts were on the upper deck, and the machinery was intact, allowing the ship to continue sailing. However, most of the upper-level cabins were destroyed, so the Customs limited the passenger capacity to fifty-nine people for safety reasons. Cargo could still be loaded.</p>
<p>Departure from Tianjin Today: Yesterday, the Shanghai Bureau received a telegram from shipowner Masun stating that the handling of the matter was proceeding according to instructions. The vessel had salt cargo in Yantai destined for Shanghai, and cabins had been pre-booked. Therefore, the ship had to sail. Today (November 11th), it departed Tianjin for Zhifu, where it will load the salt cargo before returning to Shanghai for major repairs.</p>
<p>Replacement Vessel: The weather in North China is relatively cold, and the Baihe River will soon freeze. Goods are being rushed to Tianjin. Yesterday, the China Merchants Bureau decided that when the Shinfong returns to Shanghai for major repairs, the bureau will assign the Taishun steamer to take over the route. Yesterday, a telegram was sent to the Tianjin Bureau instructing them to continue cargo loading as usual. Simultaneously, local North China cargo brokers were notified.</p>
<p>Navigation Industry Declaration: The Shanghai Navigation Industry's Nine Public Associations Joint Office issued a declaration regarding the collision of the China Merchants Bureau's Shinfong steamer by the Japanese vessel Keizan Maru. The declaration stated that the Shinfong steamer, loaded with cargo and passengers, was sailing twenty li from Tianjin at Lutsuchuang on the evening of the eighth when it was struck by the Keizan Maru, a near-sea steamship of the Japanese Shipping Company, which was departing Tianjin. The Keizan Maru failed to comply with navigation regulations and rammed into the Shinfong, causing severe damage. [China Merchants Bureau's General Manager Li formally notified the company yesterday to negotiate and reserve all loss compensation, etc.] Upon hearing this news, one's hair stands on end in anger. Over the years, Japanese vessels have repeatedly recklessly collided with Chinese ships on rivers and seas, treating human lives as a joke. The New Taming incident from a few years ago remains unresolved, and the families of the victims are still lingering in Shanghai, suffering from cold and hunger. Last year, the Yew Maru sank the New Kang steamer, injuring more than sixty workers. Now, before long, the Shinfong incident has occurred, fully demonstrating their domineering behavior, showing no respect for Chinese people. The lives of our workers on various vessels are also unprotected. In addition to requesting General Manager Li to conduct strict negotiations and forwarding a protest to the central government, this office vows to lead all workers in support, to achieve compensation for losses and guarantees against future incidents.</p>
<p>To protect the lives of workers and prevent such incidents from happening again, it is hoped that all members of the navigation industry will rise up together to provide assistance so that imperialists will be alerted. This will hopefully curb their violent acts in the future. We are filled with deep emotion and earnestly pray for your public consideration.</p>

<p>In Taixing County, banditry and communism have been rampant for the past three years, and the people are living in misery. Since County Magistrate Ma Rensheng took office, he has repeatedly led troops to suppress the bandits, who scattered at the sound of gunfire. In order to thoroughly pacify the region, a rural pacification campaign is being launched. However, the expenses for stationed troops and public security guard teams are enormous, causing considerable difficulties.

<h3 id="e186">The Kwang-shih Spinning Machine Invented by a Chinese <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The Inventor Mr. Kwei-chih Passed Away</p>
<p>The Manager Mr. Kwang-tah is Promoting the Work</p>
<p>Mr. Xing Kwang-shih, from Haimen County, Jiangsu Province, responding to the needs of society and the economy, deduced the principles of artificial spinning in China. After eight years of research, he invented the Kwang-shih spinning machine. The machine is divided into two parts: the carding machine and the yarn drawing machine. The carding machine operates by stepping on the foot pedal to insert raw cotton into the toothed cover, forming batting, which is then rolled into cotton strips and discharged from the machine. The yarn drawing machine works by placing the cotton strip tube on the machine and stepping on the foot pedal. The rotating groove tightens the cotton strip tube with a string, while gears rotate the yarn tube to wrap the yarn, stretching it to form yarn strands. The stretching and twisting occur simultaneously, which is fundamentally different from factory spinning machines. The uneven thickness is adjusted by a safety mechanism, and the thickness of the yarn is controlled by a seven-down, two-hammer system. Yarns ranging from coarse 8-count to fine 30-40 count can be spun by moving the hammer at will. The machine can spin continuously for a long time and is comparable to factory yarn. Overall, the machine's main feature is that it reduces the more than ten steps of factory spinning to two steps, which is a major innovation in the spinning machine industry. Both human and machine power can be used, making it suitable for both households and small factories, which is crucial for the livelihoods of ordinary people. However, just as the machine was about to be assembled, Mr. Xing passed away on October 20th of last year due to overexertion and various stimuli, suffering from cerebral congestion. Currently, Mr. Huang Chang-ting, who collaborated with Mr. Xing at the time, is responsible for managing the machine and is in contact with various parties to continue its development. It is expected that the machine will make a major contribution to the world's textile industry. Here is a record of the inventor Mr. Xing Kwang-shih and the manager Mr. Huang Chang-ting.</p>
<p>Xing Kwang-shih: Mr. Xing's given name was Kwang-shih, courtesy name Pu-wu, also known as Chun-hsien, a native of Haimen County, Jiangsu Province. He graduated from Shanghai Tsing-tsun Normal School and a technical school in his youth. He was skilled at [blank space] and fond of mechanics. At the age of fourteen, he built a bicycle out of wood and could ride it. Later, he imitated Zhuge Liang's wooden ox and flowing horse, creating an iron ox that could carry goods and move, but it still required slight manual propulsion, and it was difficult to maintain balance on uneven ground, so he abandoned it and began studying gravity engines. He used twenty-six gears to add gravity to keep the engine running continuously. However, since one pound of gravity only generated one pound of power and could not multiply it by a thousand or a hundred times, it was ultimately futile but had already taken six years and consumed more than half of his resources. He then turned to studying spinning machines, believing they would be easier to accomplish and would help alleviate poverty. After seven years, he completed wooden 80-spindle yarn drawing and carding machines, but they were not yet perfect. Mr. Xing was a poor scholar, and for more than ten years, he was able to devote himself to mechanics because of the competence of his wife, Madam Ni. However, he was eventually plagued by economic hardship and had to stop. A year later, he met Mr. Chang-ting, who provided financial support to help him continue the project by planning and constructing iron [blank space] 10-spindle yarn drawing and carding machines, which were completed in just over a year. Unexpectedly, just as assembly was about to be completed, Mr. Xing succumbed to the exhaustion of poverty and hardship, dying on October 20th, 1929, at the age of only forty-one.</p>
<p>Huang Chang-ting: Huang Chang-ting, courtesy name [blank space] Yi, is a native of Haimen County, Jiangsu Province, aged thirty-two. He graduated from National Nanjing Higher Normal School and Southeast University. Through a relative or friend, he met Mr. Xing because he was really constrained to interrupt the development of his spinning machine.</p>

<p>The upper right corner shows the photograph of the inventor, Mr. Xing Kwang-shih, and the upper left corner shows the photograph of the manager, Mr. Huang Chang-ting.</p>
<p>At that time, Mr. Xing had other [blank space] in Luoyang and resigned. He resolutely collaborated with Mr. Xing, with Mr. Xing in charge of manufacturing and Mr. Huang in charge of finances and planning. However, his family was poor and had no savings, so he sold his property and borrowed money to barely make ends meet. After Mr. Xing died and had no money for his funeral, Mr. Huang managed his funeral and educated his orphaned children, continuing the development of the machine. All of this depended on Mr. Huang's planning and management, and his perseverance is admirable.</p>
<h3 id="e188">News About Chrysanthemum Exhibitions in Late Autumn and Early Winter <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Garden Farm: The Municipal Garden Farm's Chrysanthemum Exhibition was postponed to today due to continuous rain. Notable figures who have visited include Municipal Government Section Chief Huang Daolin, Land Bureau Director Zhu Yan, Section Chief Wu Tonghua, Social Bureau Director Pan Kungchan, Section Chief Feng Liutang, Navy Deputy Minister Ren, Deputy Minister Niu, Director Xie, famous painters Wang Yiting, Xie Kungchan, Zhang Xinggu, Ma Mengzhen, as well as municipal council members and schools, including the Provincial Fisheries School, the Chinese Art College, and municipal elementary schools such as Haining, Peichao, Gaohang, Jingcheng, and Yucai. Group visits included the Yousheng Travel Group and the Gaohang District Security Corps. Organizations include the Gaohang District Education Association, the Flower and Tree Industry Association, and photography groups from all walks of life, numbering no fewer than five to six thousand people. The first entries in the album of poems and inscriptions on chrysanthemums include Mayor Zhang Qun's inscription "Beautiful Autumn Scenery," Secretary-General Yu's inscription "The Spirit of Braving Frost," and Social Bureau Director Pan Kungchan's inscription "Refreshing Dew Floats in the Morning, Thick Frost Stains at Night, Occupying the Year's Fragrance and Standing Alone, Severe Late Season, Strong of Character and Noble of Integrity, Who Says It Is Not Suitable to Be Called a Hermit?" Xie Kungchan painted a page with a golden-backed red chrysanthemum, titled "Chrysanthemum as a Guest of Longevity." Wang Yiting and Zhang Xinggu also painted various chrysanthemums, which were dazzling and beautiful. Sunday is the ninth day, which is also the date for the municipal government staff to dine together. On that day, there were even more visitors, and each brought their families to attend the banquet. There were fifteen tables with exquisite delicacies. It was said that the municipal council member of the district, Pan Hongding, was in charge. The Garden Farm Director Bao Rong and the Social Bureau Section Chief Wu Huanru were busy directing the exhibition. The hospitality was especially attentive. Those who enjoyed drinking at the table all cheered and celebrated. After the banquet, they gathered by the fountain in the park to take a group photo to commemorate the occasion. Today is also the anniversary of the Prime Minister's birth, and all agencies are on holiday. It is expected that there will be even more visitors today than in the past two days. This is especially noted here to commemorate the grand occasion of the exhibition.</p>
<p>Labor University of Agriculture: The National Labor University's College of Agriculture has been established for three years. Last autumn, it moved from Jiangwan to the Guangguan Farm in Sitang Bridge, Wusong, to study agricultural technology using scientific methods. The college has accumulated several years of achievements but has not had the opportunity to contribute to the public, which is a great pity. Now, as autumn fades and chrysanthemums bloom, the college's farm horticulture department has cultivated over 400 varieties of rare chrysanthemums, totaling over 7,000 pots, with various colors competing for beauty. They wish to share them with the public and will hold a chrysanthemum exhibition from November 12th to 14th, with an open exhibition. On the first day of the exhibition, there will also be recreational activities and film screenings to add to the enjoyment.</p>
<p>Joint Chrysanthemum Exhibition: The Municipal Poor Children's Home and the Chun Xuehui will jointly hold a chrysanthemum exhibition from the 10th to the 16th of this month at the Chun Xuehui on Chunghua Road, Xiaonanmen, starting at 1:00 PM each day. The Poor Children's Home has been growing chrysanthemums for twenty years and enjoys a great reputation. The exhibition will feature selected high-quality chrysanthemums and elegant displays, as well as famous teas and snacks for guests to chat while listening to Kunqu opera. At the same time, there will be an exhibition of Chinese and Western charts and academic achievements from the Deaf and Dumb School affiliated with the Chun Xuehui. Those in Shanghai who have a penchant for Tao Yuanming should visit. It is said that admission tickets are required and can be obtained by sending a one-cent stamp in a self-addressed envelope.</p>

<p>Sixteen Boatmen in Total</p>
<p>Drifted for a Day and a Night</p>
<p>Fortunately Rescued by a Fishing Boat</p>
<p>The Cargo is Missing</p>
<p>The large fishing boat Jin Shuntai, loaded with 5,000 pieces of timber, over 1,000 loads of green charcoal, and other miscellaneous goods from Wenzhou, Fujian Province, was sailing into the Yangtze River to unload its cargo. At about 5:00 AM the day before yesterday, while sailing through the Tongsha waters off the coast of Wusong, a hurricane suddenly arose on the sea, and the waves were surging. The boat could not move forward and was soon submerged by a huge wave. The sixteen crew members on board saw that the boat was doomed and that they would become denizens of the deep. They were terrified and quickly cut down the canvas of the main mast. The crew members all hid under the canvas and drifted with the waves for a day and a night. In the vast ocean, there was no shore in sight. It was about 7:00 AM the next day (yesterday) that the boatmen, who had lost all hope of survival, were in dire straits. Fortunately, a fishing boat from Dayangshan passed by and noticed them. They rushed to rescue them, and all sixteen crew members were saved, but they were all on the verge of death. After being resuscitated, they gradually regained consciousness. The crew members then took a small sailboat to Wusong at about 5:00 PM yesterday to report to the water police and request that they investigate the whereabouts of the cargo.</p>
<h3 id="e190">The Murderer in the Funing Case Was Arrested in Shanghai <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Claimed to Have Fled to Shanghai After the Murder</p>
<p>Two Suspects Were Detained by the Police After Eating Lunch</p>
<p>Cui Changsheng, a native of Funing, lived in the forty-eight rooms of Nanyang Bridge. His cousin, Yang Tianxiang, was a 22-year-old farmer who had some savings. On the 29th of last month, he was suddenly murdered, and the murderer fled without a trace. Cui was in Shanghai and did not know about this matter until he received a letter from his uncle, Yang Bingfa, on the 9th, in which he learned the details. The letter stated that his second son, Tianxiang, was shot dead on the 29th by Wei Qin-zhi, Yang Bingqian, Li Yu-chen, Xu Guowu, Yang Weixing, etc. The county government has been petitioned to conduct an autopsy and arrest the murderer. It is heard that the murderer has fled to Shanghai, so please be vigilant in investigating the case and avenging the injustice. Cui Changsheng was originally acquainted with Yang Weixing and others when he was in his hometown, so after receiving the letter, he paid close attention to the investigation. At first, Cui met Yang Weifeng on Beiler Road in the French Concession on the morning of the 9th. Yang said that he had fled to Shanghai because he had committed a murder in his hometown. However, at that time, Cui Changsheng had not yet received the letter from his uncle and did not pay attention to Yang's words. Cui was shocked when he received the letter that afternoon and went to inquire, but he did not meet Yang. Yesterday morning, he met Yang Weixing on Shanxi Road again and pretended not to know about the murder case, inviting Yang to lunch at a restaurant at the Baoshan Road intersection. Cui then persuaded Yang to invite Yang Bingqian to go together. After arriving in the Chinese territory, Cui immediately called the police to detain the two Yangs at the fifth district public security bureau on Baoshan Road. Yang Weixing, 29 years old, from Funing, served as the village chief. He claimed that he came to Shanghai on the 11th to treat his eye disease and lived on Pingji Road in the French Concession. Yang Bingqian, 25 years old, from Funing, served as the deputy village chief. He came to Shanghai on the 13th to treat his hemorrhoids and lived on Shanxi Road. Both denied the murder case of Yang Tianxiang and claimed that Yang Tianxiang had a conflict with Wei Qin-zhi, the patrol chief of the sixth police station of the fifth branch of the Funing County Public Security Bureau, over the collection of land taxes and was shot to death. The plaintiff, Cui Changsheng, has now sent a telegram to Funing requesting that they come and take the suspects away.</p>

<p>Detective Shang Wu of the Huishi Patrol Room previously arrested four bandits: Ting Chin-fang, Wang Kuo-liang, Yang Lien-en, and Chen Miao-ching. It was found that Ting kidnapped Zhou Tsung-chih, the accountant of the Hong Yu Cotton Yarn Company on Dagu Road, at 9:15 AM on January 14th of last year, and demanded ransom. Wang and Yang were involved in writing threatening letters to Shao Yen-shan, the manager of the Tung Yu Money Exchange on Tianjin Road. Chen was suspected of helping the criminals escape. They were sent to the Special District Local Court for interrogation. The court has now reached a verdict, which was announced by Judge Sun Yuan in the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning. The main text of the verdict states that Ting Chin-fang is sentenced to death for kidnapping and demanding ransom, and deprived of his civil rights for life. Wang Kuo-liang is sentenced to two years of imprisonment for attempted extortion and two years of imprisonment for possessing military weapons, with the sentences to be served concurrently for a total of two years and two months. The number of days of detention before the final judgment can be used to offset the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day. Yang Lien-en and Chen Miao-ching are found not guilty. Yang and Chen each submitted a bond of 500 yuan and one confiscated pistol during the appeal period.</p>
<h3 id="e192">The Grand Occasion of the Chinese Unit's Encampment <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese unit of the Shanghai International Business Association holds an encampment every year in the autumn and winter to award prizes to its members, as previously reported. The unit entered the camp on the 7th, and the camp broke up yesterday morning. All officers and members spent three days and nights together in the camp, followed by intensive training, combining drills and shooting practice. Their diligence is indeed admirable. Their military uniforms are neat and clean, their military appearance is solemn, and their weapons are shiny. All of these are commendable and admirable, making them worthy of repeated awards and recognition as the champion of the entire group and the only one of its kind in the business community. It is heard that the results of this year's encampment are better than in previous years, and the number of Chinese and foreign guests is also greater than in previous years. The details of the award ceremony are as follows:</p>
<p>Hall Arrangement: The hall was in the largest room among the dormitories. The room was spacious and beautifully decorated, with utmost grandeur. The rostrum was in the center, with guest seats on the side. Each guest seat was provided with a program issued by the unit for guests to browse after being seated. Various prizes were placed on a long table in front of the rostrum, all silver-made cups and spoons of various sizes to be awarded to members of all ranks who had achieved excellent shooting results throughout the year. Because the event was solemn, Mr. Abbenpaymann, the commander-in-chief of the group, and his wife were invited to present the awards to show honor. Guest Speakers: In addition to the representative of Foreign Minister Wang, Director Liu Yunfang, guests included Henk Lief of the Group Staff, Luo Si, Chairman of the International Competition, and Mr. Yuan Lvdeng of the Public Works Bureau. Director Liu spoke briefly, saying that the concession has a vast territory and the Chinese population is larger than the Western population. The establishment of a self-defense group by Chinese merchants can directly protect the Chinese people without isolation and achieve complete security. The Chinese unit has made real contributions to this end. The reputation of the Chinese unit is well-known, and there is no need to learn about it from newspapers. One can know a glimpse of its usual achievements by observing the awards listed on the table today. But this is just the surface. In reality, China's army is far inferior to those of other countries, but the Chinese unit is comparable to them. This has a great bearing on diplomatic relations. It is more difficult to manage a business group than an army. The army is driven by payment, while the business group is entirely voluntary. It is truly commendable to have achieved such good results with voluntarism. (Details omitted)</p>
<p>Unit Commander's Speech: Said that the Chinese unit has made great strides forward. The various cups and shields won in the past years are too numerous to count. In the previous session, it won the silver shield for its competent services. All of these are due to the diligent leadership and well-organized training of Captain Wang and other officers, resulting in such excellent results. Following Director Liu's [blank space], the guests visited and opened up a new [blank space] for the encampment and award ceremony, which added a lot of color to the unit. I hope that all the members of the Chinese unit will continue to work hard and move forward. Then the unit will be fortunate and the Chinese businessmen will be honored. (Details omitted)</p>
<p>Elegant Music and Dance: On this day, Chen Qizhao, Yuan Sheng, and his nephews brought musical instruments such as the Mengda Cup and performed several Sandalwood tunes. The sound was deep and far-reaching, adding beauty and dispelling worldly concerns. Then, the ladies of the Southeast Women's Physical Education School performed the Butterfly Love Flower dance, which was extremely beautiful. In addition, Miss Wu, the daughter of Mr. Wu Zilin, performed a solo piano piece, which was fluent, skillful, and melodious. It is said that Miss Wu is only eleven years old, and her playing skills are beyond those of ordinary veterans. Her talent is unprecedented.</p>
<p>Issuing Diplomas and Awards: The unit awards diplomas to members who have performed well in their usual duties and have served for many years to reward them. It is learned that there are two members who have served for fifteen years and are eligible for diplomas, six members who have served for ten years, five members who have served for five years, and two members who have served for three years and have completed their contracts. The unit commander's wife presented the diplomas one by one and shook hands with the recipients to express her respect and love.</p>
<p>Members' Entertainment: In the evening, members of all ranks of the unit performed on stage, including slapstick comedy, Peking opera, martial arts, magic, and Chinese and Western instrumental music. Each person had a skill, and the atmosphere was lively. The unit commander, Mr. Wang Yanqing, sang an excerpt from "Cinnabar Mole" as the excitement reached its peak, and the applause was thunderous. The festivities continued until 11:00 PM before everyone went to bed.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Ferry Operators at Muddy Ford Request Designation of a Wharf <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Ferry operators Li Ching-hua and Lu San-san of Pudong's Muddy Ford submitted a document to the Shanghai Municipal Fifth District Party Department, stating that the livelihood of the ferry operators is dependent on maintaining their business, and requesting that the Municipal Government be consulted to designate a ferry wharf for permanent use. It is learned that Ching-hua's original Muddy Ford ferry service was converted into a municipal ferry by the Municipal Public Works Bureau, and their livelihood was in jeopardy. They previously requested that the department take measures to provide relief. Having read in the newspaper that the Municipal Government had responded to the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Government stated that the original Muddy Ford ferry service would still be allowed to continue operating and that the location of the ferry and the ferry service would not conflict. This inclusive representation of the municipal government is out of the department's intent to protect the livelihood of the people. Ching-hua and others are deeply grateful for the benefits they have received. However, the Muddy Justice Wharf that Ching-hua and others are currently using and the Tungchang Wharf designated by the Municipal Public Works Bureau for the municipal ferry are both located on private land owned by the Yu family. In 1927, the landowner Yu Chih-ching discontinued the Muddy Justice Wharf for usage relation of the land and changed the discharging site to the Tungchang Wharf. A request has been submitted to the former Tanggong Bureau. However, for some reason, it was not implemented. The Tungchang Wharf has now been designated as a ferry wharf by the Municipal Public Works Bureau.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>If the Yu family landowner insists on reclaiming the discontinued Muddy Justice Wharf, then the ferry service of Ching-hua and others will inevitably follow the same path as the municipal ferry. The ferry and ferry service operating in the same location will naturally not leave any room for the ferry service to stand. In order to determine the location of the ferry wharf, Ching-hua and others have applied to the Municipal Public Works Bureau to investigate the archives and designate the Muddy Justice Wharf currently used by Ching-hua and others or other suitable locations as a permanent wharf for the ferry service, so that the livelihood of dozens of families can be protected. The livelihoods of dozens of families are all dependent on the relief efforts of the department. They still earnestly hope that it will be maintained throughout and that the Municipal Government will be consulted to order the Municipal Public Works Bureau to quickly designate a permanent ferry wharf to protect the livelihoods of dozens of families in Ching-hua and others. This would truly be a benevolent act. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Fifth District Party Department.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhang Zilian has been actively promoting national goods after establishing the Chinese National Products Market at the Municipal Hall on Nanjing Road. Mr. Du Yuesheng, who is enthusiastic about public welfare, praised this endeavor and will purchase land in the South City to build a building and open a national goods department store to support Mr. Zhang. He will soon go to Beijing to inspect the location and start planning. The future of national goods is very optimistic.</p>

<p>Prompting the Abolition of Coal Contracting Methods</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau believes that boiler coal is a major expenditure for the power plant. Whether it is burned economically is directly related to the cost and indirectly affects electricity prices. It is necessary to pay special attention to this. It is now found that the boiler coal used by the China Electric Company has been using coal contracting methods for many years. Everything is entrusted to the contracted coal company without any investigation. Whether the quality of coal and the amount of coal used are commensurate with the contracted price has not been calculated, and it is impossible to investigate whether the burning is economical. Moreover, the company's boiler equipment will soon be [blank space]. The amount of coal used will increase in the future, making coal contracting methods even more unsuitable. The company is therefore ordered to abolish the coal contracting system as soon as possible in order to calculate costs and improve efficiency.</p>

<p>After the sampan worker Xin Dingxiang was pushed into the Huangpu River and drowned by French sailors, various labor unions and hometown associations in this city organized a Xin Case Support Association, distributed declarations, and invited more than twenty Ningbo lawyers to discuss the legal issues of the Xin case in order to petition the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for legal negotiations and to protect national dignity. Yesterday, the lawyers reported the results of their investigation of the case to the Ningbo Hometown Association in Shanghai, stating: [After the colleagues questioned Zhu Gengsheng, Ge Amao, and Xin Siyuan, etc., who witnessed the incident at the Shanghai Ningbo Hometown Association on November 2nd of this year, the colleagues jointly investigated the facts of this case (1) The two French sailors should have given Xin Dingxiang the boat fare, but they refused to pay, the fault was on their side first (2) Xin Dingxiang was standing at the bow of the sampan, if he was pushed, there was a possibility he would drown and die, anyone could recognize the danger of the result, according to the law, the French sailors violently pushed Xin Dingxiang into the water causing him to drown and die, their actions have the suspicion of intentional homicide, as for what happened after the incident, the 415 Indian constables and the Western constables of the water patrol station released the French sailors who were suspected of murder without pursuing them according to law, there is also the suspicion of dereliction of duty, this matter concerns the national dignity and the lives of the people, therefore, we dare to report the results of the investigation as follows (attached three pieces of draft statements from Xin Siyuan, Zhu Gengsheng, and Ge Amao) Investigation report by lawyers Wei Tong, Dai Chengxiang, Hu Fenglian, Hu Jun'an, Chen Ziyu, Liu Lailiang, Shan Junren]</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to Mr. Edwards, the General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council, stating: Respected Sir, having investigated the harms of gambling to the common people, the creation of all kinds of evils, and the administrative experience and common sense that everyone knows, this Association detests gambling as an enemy and has actively attacked and requested the Council to ban the dog racing gambling since the beginning until now. We deeply feel that the Council initially did not pay attention to it and continued to protect it, resulting in this area becoming a source of evil, the same as Gomorrah. Now, Council Chairman Mr. Fessenden and Chief Inspector Mr. Qu Jide share the same opinion on anti-gambling as this Association and proposed to first ban dog racing gambling, but the operators of the dog racing track published a rebuttal in the newspaper, as if gambling is a business that the people of civilized countries should have and placed the responsibility of permission on the Council. Fortunately, the Council corrected its mistake and did not prioritize the interests of a few people over the interests of all residents. Chairman Fessenden made a statement today declaring that a gambling ban is imperative. This Association firmly believes that at the Council meeting at 4:30 PM tomorrow, regarding the ban on dog racing gambling, in addition to Director Hua Chongri naturally supporting it unanimously, the remaining British and American Directors, if they are not shareholders or related to the dog racing track, will definitely base their decision on their administrative experience and common sense and will also support it unanimously, otherwise, they will not be able to call themselves people of civilized countries. Correspondingly, this letter is sent in the hope that you will review it and request that the Council unanimously decide to ban gambling and express respect to Chairman Fessenden on your behalf.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Ministry Orders Attention to Ham Shipped to Hong Kong and Macau <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Must Undergo Pre-Slaughter and Post-Slaughter Inspection</p>
<p>Before Being Allowed to be Shipped to Hong Kong and Macau for Sale</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce stated that recently, according to the report of the China Ham Joint Company, in recent months, ham from our country has often been transshipped through Hong Kong, Macau, Qingdao, and other places to be gradually loaded to the Philippine Islands, a territory of China. This ham is not only not subject to legal pre-slaughter and post-slaughter inspection, but is mostly inferior goods on the market for profit. At a time when American meat merchants are resisting the import of our country's meat merchants, it is feared that once this unsanitary ham is inspected by the Philippine government, it will inevitably issue a ban, affecting international trade, which is no small matter. For this reason, it is appealed to consult the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the authorities in Hong Kong and Macau to strictly investigate and prohibit it, and to order the Qingdao Customs and local authorities to investigate and prohibit it in order to solidify the position of international trade. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce stated that the shipping of ham to the Philippine Islands has special circumstances. Previously, it had ordered the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau that from July of this year, ham made from legs that have undergone pre-slaughter and post-slaughter inspection can be shipped for sale. Now, it orders the Bureau again that in the future, attention should be paid to ham shipped to Hong Kong and Macau.</p>

<p>Appraiser Has Submitted Report</p>
<p>Vietnamese constable No. 398 of the French Concession police station was on duty at the intersection of Route Sayzoong and Rue Massenet in July when a car No. 1873 driven by Yu Xinkui, a driver of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and a car No. 2377 driven by Sun Zulin, a driver of Sun Baorong, a councilor of the Municipal Government, collided with each other, injuring and killing the constable. Afterwards, the police station brought the two parties to the French court for several trials, and the court ordered personnel to investigate the circumstances of the incident at that time before reviewing the case. Yesterday, another trial was held. First, Mr. Teppak, the lawyer representing Yu Xinkui, stated that the appraiser's report now proves that his client was not at fault. At that time, the accident was caused by Sun Zulin's car driving from south to north at excessive speed, so it is difficult to shirk the blame for causing this disaster. At that time, his client's car was damaged by Sun's car, and the repair cost was estimated to be 280 taels. In addition, since the car was hit, it could not be driven and was detained by the police station. The car owner hired another car for use, and the loss was estimated to be 1,000 taels, which he requested to be compensated for in total. Mr. Bahr, the lawyer representing Sun Zulin, stated that after his lawyer observed the appraiser's report, the words were all one-sided. According to the actual situation at the time, Yu Xinkui's car was speeding, causing his client's car to be unable to brake and stop, causing the accident. His client was not at fault, and the blame was on the other party. He requested a public judgment. The Chinese and Western officials announced the end of the debate and listened to the review and judgment.</p>

<p>Trembling After Being Rescued</p>
<p>There Were Two Reasons for the Suicide</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 1 PM, a teenager wearing a military uniform with a military belt, resembling a junior officer, was wandering around the Renji Road pier on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek. Suddenly, he walked to the edge of the pier and jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, the 31st and 67th Chinese constables of the water patrol station were patrolling the river and immediately took measures to rescue him. At that time, the weather was very cold, and the teenager was drenched and shivering. After being taken back to the police station and changing into dry clothes, he claimed that his name was Sun Deyuan, and he came from the military. Because he was disappointed in love and suffered economic pressure, he took this desperate path. His father's name is Sun Weiwen, and he lives at No. 405 Yaofu Lane, Hankou Road. The head constable ordered Chinese detective Cheng Yongnian to go to the address to inform his father, who arrived at the police station and returned home with Sun.</p>

<p>Totaled 32 Million Yuan</p>
<p>With an Export Surplus of 21 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese Commercial Counselor's Office in this city received a telegram from its home country stating that the total amount of Japanese-Chinese exports in October was 32 million Japanese yen, and the export surplus (that is, the import deficit from our country's perspective) accounted for 21 million yuan. Also, from January to October, Japan's export surplus in trade with China totaled 92 million yuan, but this was 59 million yuan less than in the same period last year. As for Japan's total foreign trade, exports in October totaled 128 million yuan, with an export surplus of 26 million yuan. However, the total foreign trade for the ten months of this year is still an import deficit of 115 million yuan, which is 22 million yuan more than in the same period last year. If there were no export surplus in trade with China to offset it, the total import surplus would reach more than 200 million yuan.</p>

<p>Has Traveled Over 30,000 Miles</p>
<p>Esperanto scholar Beeler, who is only twenty-four years old, set off from Lyon, France, on July 24, 1928, riding a bicycle eastward through Central Asia and into Soviet Russia, then to Japan, where he stayed for three months. Now he has arrived in Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru. According to Mr. Beeler, he has traveled more than 20,000 miles since he set off. He encountered many dangers when he passed through Central Asia, but fortunately he was safe. The purpose of this trip is to promote Esperanto. He achieved great results in Japan for several months. Now that he has come to Shanghai, he is willing to discuss Esperanto with comrades in Shanghai who speak Esperanto and to tell them about his travels. He also said that there is another comrade named Schlier who can arrive in Shanghai by Green Shirt steamer today. He will cooperate with him to study and promote the method of Esperanto. As for how long Mr. Beeler will stay in Shanghai, he himself cannot predict. After leaving Shanghai in the future, he plans to go to Vietnam, the Straits Settlements, Australia, etc., and then return to China via the Americas.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Huanhu Avenue Plan <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Ye</p>
<p>The vast Taihu Lake between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces spans 36,000 qing, with 72 peaks appearing and disappearing within, long renowned for its scenic beauty. The National Government has discussed the idea of a Taihu Lake Park. Subsequently, to improve the scenery, the first priority is to build a Huanhu (around the lake) Avenue. Furthermore, the tranquility of Taihu Lake also relies on the convenience of the Huanhu transportation. Once decided, the two provinces were ordered to work together to realize it as soon as possible. Now, the plan is recorded and described below.</p>
<p>After the two provincial governments received the order to design this spring, the Construction Departments of each province actively prepared, formulating a general plan. Separate surveying teams were dispatched to predict the route in order to estimate the cost. After several months of effort, the route was determined and the cost estimated. Then, personnel were sent again to formally determine the route. The Huanhu route is more than 800 li long. Except for the southwest corner of Taihu Lake, from Yixing in Su to Wuxing in Zhe, about 300 li of the Beijing-Hangzhou Road has been completed, and there is no need to build it separately. There are still more than 500 li to be built. Of these 500 li, 400 li are in Jiangsu Province, and only 100 li are in Zhejiang Province. This is because in Jiangsu Province, from Yiwu to the southern border of Wujiang that connects with Zhejiang, no county roads have been built along the lake. Everything needs to be done from scratch, so the project is vast. In Zhejiang Province, the section of the Beijing-Hangzhou Road along the lake reaches more than 200 li, so its project is only about one-quarter of that in Jiangsu. The width of the road is currently set at 30 feet and will be widened as needed in the future. This is the general situation of the project in the two provinces.</p>
<p>The route through Jiangsu Province was carefully considered. Although the Lvxi-Yixing provincial road has not been built, the route had already been determined when Director Wang Qian was in charge of the Construction Department. However, at that time, there was no discussion of the Huanhu Avenue, so the places passed through were not purely along Taihu Lake. Now, in order to facilitate the Huanhu Road, the route has been changed to be closer to Taihu Lake, so that this road can achieve two benefits at once. Starting from Wuxi, it passes through Yuantouzhu, Jingshe Mountain, Wuli Lake, Nanfangquan, Huadafang Village, Xin'an Town, Wangting, and enters Suzhou territory along East Taihu Lake. Then it passes through Guangfu, Mudu, Wuxian City, Pingwang, Zhenze, and reaches Nanxun in Zhejiang. After this, from Nanxun to Wuxing, it belongs to the Zhejiang Province route, which has also been determined early on.</p>
<p>The cost of building the road in Jiangsu Province is estimated to be at least 2 million yuan. The route is long, and there are many small roads crisscrossing between Wuxi and Wujiang. The soil foundation is difficult to fill, and the cost of bridges and culverts is even greater. The provincial treasury is poor and cannot raise funds. Therefore, 1.975 million yuan has been included in the construction bonds issued as the construction cost of this road, and has been submitted to the National Government for approval. The approximately 400,000 yuan required for the more than 100 li in Zhejiang Province is easier to plan.</p>
<p>The recent work progress: The Construction Departments of the two provinces feel that this road is really needed and must be realized as soon as possible. Although the route has been determined before, for the sake of accuracy, they have each sent surveying personnel from the Highway Bureau to re-survey the front line. After everything is ready, the work can be carried out as soon as the funds are allocated without any obstacles.</p>
<h3 id="e220">The Multi-Cylinder Craze in the American Automotive World <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Zheng</p>
<p>Social fashion favors multi-cylinder engines, with some having as many as sixteen. A major change in the automotive manufacturing world.</p>
<p>During the summer of this year, there was a very strange rumor in the automotive world: that the Cadillac Motor Company had decided not to build twelve- and sixteen-cylinder cars this year. After receiving this news, the Automotive Weekly immediately visited the company manager for his opinion on the matter. He smiled and told the reporter, "These words can only be proven by future facts." Counting the days, it has been several months since summer, and Cadillac's multi-cylinder cars are still being built there, and the rumor has finally gone from heated to cold, from cold to silent.</p>
<p>Because of this incident, the Automotive Weekly was reminded of various observations regarding this issue. Why did the society create such a rumor? Undoubtedly, it must have thought that this matter was important. The magazine is very willing to conduct an in-depth study of the number of cylinders issue in the future for the reference of readers.</p>
<p>According to the magazine's opinion, there are two reasons why multi-cylinder cars (referring to those with more than eight cylinders) have not been developed in the past seven years. There are also two reasons why multi-cylinder cars will not only not be discontinued in the future but will also become more important. In the past seven years, most people have regarded high-priced trains as luxury goods, and only a very small number of people have purchased them. Multi-cylinder cars belong to the high-priced category, so their sales will naturally be affected. Second, the machines of the previous multi-cylinder cars had not yet reached the realm of perfection. How did they evolve? For example, when the car started, many noises had to be produced because there were many cylinders. On the one hand, the maintenance cost was surprisingly high. For the sake of cheapness and convenience, people did not bother to buy multi-cylinder cars. These are two conclusions based on facts. Why do we say that multi-cylinder cars will be developed in the near future? There are not many reasons either, only two points. The first point is because people in society welcome eight-cylinder cars and others. According to the change in social psychology, everyone abandons four-cylinder and six-cylinder cars and competes on eight-cylinder and twelve-cylinder cars. Cars are a kind of business, just like ordinary clothes. If you want to make money, the way to win is to cater to social psychology first. Social psychology tends to focus on multi-cylinder cars, especially eight-cylinder cars, so manufacturers have no choice but to follow. The second point is that high-priced cars have made slower progress, so they cannot win without using multiple cylinders. The reason is this: In recent years, almost the entire automotive world has been dominated by low-priced cars. Low-priced cars keep clamoring for improvement. As a result, because of desperate competition, low-priced cars have gradually obtained all the advantages of high-priced cars. In this way, high-priced cars are panicked. In order to maintain their superior position and compete with low-priced cars, they have to find another way. Otherwise, it can be said that they will be completely replaced by low-priced cars. So they thought of the multi-cylinder system. Low-priced cars cannot achieve this, so they focus on working hard on this. At the same time, people in society are tired of sitting in low-priced cars and think of multi-cylinder cars again. In this way, a sudden turning point has occurred in the automotive world again.</p>
<p>Talking about the history of eight-cylinder cars is also very interesting. Eight-cylinder cars were produced in 1915. At that time, there were two companies manufacturing them. The following year, the number suddenly increased to twelve. In 1917, two more companies were added. In 1918, due to business decline and the outbreak of the European War, the number decreased to thirteen. After 1919, it plummeted even further, with only seven or eight remaining. In 1921, it rose to eleven. In 1922, two more were added. In 1923, there was no change. In 1924, it decreased again. The most impressive thing is that in 1928, it jumped from fourteen to nineteen. The following year, it rose to twenty-two, so it had a very rapid upward trend. This year, it has reached the highest number of twenty-seven companies. The founders of the eight-cylinder cars in 1915 are worth mentioning. These are Cadillac and Packard, and during this period, Packard was the first to create twelve-cylinder cars, followed by Cadillac.</p>
<p>Now everyone feels a strong interest in multi-cylinder cars, but we want to ask whether the cost will increase if there are more cylinders. The answer to this question was positive in the past, but it is negative now. Because the current multi-cylinder cars have been improved more than before when they are manufactured. The first thing they pay attention to is the cost problem. Because if this difficulty is not overcome, they cannot compete with low-priced cars. So now we can say that the cost of multi-cylinder cars is not higher than that of any low-priced car. Needless to say, the consumption of car oil, even the repair cost in the future, will not increase because there are more cylinders. Since multi-cylinder cars have these advantages, plus they can generate great power and run quickly, they are welcomed. And twelve-cylinder and sixteen-cylinder cars make people feel excited. However, in our opinion, sixteen cylinders are not needed yet. First, American road laws are very strict and often limit the speed of vehicles. The speed shall not exceed a certain number of miles per hour, so even if there is a car with a great speed, it will ultimately be a hero without a place to use it and cannot take effect. Moreover, if the speed can be fast to a considerable extent, there will be malpractices. For example, the biggest reason for causing accidents is based on the speed problem. Ten years ago, the highest speed of a car was 70 miles per hour, and it was usually only 30 miles. Now, it can travel 100 miles per hour, but only 45 miles are used. So although the car can be fast, it is ultimately difficult to use. Therefore, multi-cylinder cars with sixteen cylinders are probably not needed for the time being except as a fashion.</p>
<p>From the above, we can know that although multi-cylinder cars failed in the past seven years, they have now recovered. Not only have they recovered, but everyone feels a strong interest in them, and there is a tendency of "Multi-Cylinder Craze." The reasons are nothing more than the changes in people's hearts and the internal improvements. The curiosity of Americans is the most obvious in the world. Since this psychological change, the manufacture of multi-cylinder cars must be greatly developed. However, in the opinion of our magazine's reporters, eight cylinders are the most suitable for multi-cylinder cars. Twelve and sixteen cylinders are not very useful. However, car companies cater to the psychology of people in society after all.</p>
<p>When everyone thinks that twelve-cylinder and sixteen-cylinder cars are fashionable, they will naturally produce them as well (Translated from Automotive Weekly).</p>
<h3 id="e221">On the Installment Payment System in the Automotive Industry <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Jia</p>
<p>According to statistics from the local East Continental Bank, all old car mortgage loans in the first half of this year have exceeded last year's business volume. It is gratifying to see such progress in this era of economic depression.</p>
<p>Earlier, when local car dealerships first implemented the installment payment system a few years ago, people predicted that it would not have good results. At that time, various experts discussed the benefits of this system and its impact on finance, and there was no consensus. The United States was particularly concerned, because in 1925, the annual sales in the United States had reached US$5,000,000,000.</p>
<p>Opponents of the installment payment system said that the sales of cars, household labor-saving machines, new clothes, radios, and various furniture have opened up new markets and can never meet the needs of the old installment payment system.</p>
<p>Supporters said that large-scale production can increase wages, and high wages mean the ability to make installment payments. Since the installment payment system became popular, the machines for large-scale production have been working non-stop. The above is a continuous cycle, but most critics still do not believe it.</p>
<p>In 1925, the New York Citibank Gazette published opinions against the installment payment system. Others, such as Senator Lames Couzens of Michigan, also strongly criticized it.</p>
<p>But in 1930, the New York Citibank's August Gazette, in view of the fact that the installment payment system had withstood risks and remained as solid as a rock, changed its tone as follows:</p>
<p>It said, "Although we cannot be sure of the final result of this system at present, because the length of the economic depression is closely related to this system, most people predict that the disputes of this system are exaggerated. Also, according to the records of major banks today, all have benefited greatly.</p>
<p>"According to bank reports, the records of all leading car banks in the United States prove that this installment payment system, if implemented properly, will not leave any weakness in the economic system."</p>
<h3 id="e222">The Success Story of the New Buick (2) <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Li Jiren</p>
<p>The new Buick straight-eight-cylinder car has been enthusiastically welcomed by all walks of life since it was launched. Today, the wheels of the new Buick are all over the world, and people from all countries have expressed the same enthusiastic welcome, realizing General Motors' slogan: "Only Buick can build beautiful cars."</p>
<p>The foundation of the new Buick's success lies in the beginning. According to Ke Lishi Wa Yun (manager of Shanghai General Motors), the value of orders placed before the new car was manufactured has exceeded US$150 million, which is not an exaggeration. Every year before the new model is launched, old Buick owners have already reserved one to replace it every year and enjoy the taste of a new car. This year's Buick has been greatly improved with eight cylinders, oil temperature limiter, double carbonizer, dual-use intake silencer and air purifier. The simultaneous meshing transmission method is a feature of the transformation in the past three years and is the reason why people in the automotive industry are sincerely welcoming it.</p>
<p>Success lies in excellent construction. The success story of Buick in the past 26 years also lies in this. To date, more than 2.6 million Buick cars have been manufactured, and there are still 1.5 million cars running around the world. According to research, 88% of old Buick owners now purchase new Buick cars, and the annual sales account for half of all types of cars.</p>
<p>The cars manufactured by the Buick factory are not used as test products by car owners, which is also a major reason for their success and an important point for making car owners happy. Buick carefully considers all mechanical improvements or new inventions from a long-term perspective and conducts thorough tests in advance. Therefore, the launch of the new Buick car has three years of field testing and precise research.</p>

<p>Social News Why Edison said that education can be replaced by movies instead of books Dr. Wei Zhong speaks Yang Chuoran Zhu Keji notes We are all like people on duty What our managers say, we do We just obey orders Why? Because our brains are not enough. Human brains are not enough. The revolutions in human history are all empty talk. The revolutions in history are not revolutions, but just that there was an emperor before, and then a few emperors came later. The people in the Republic of China in history are all on duty, following the orders of others to make revolutions. Even during the revolutionary period, they are still on duty, still obeying orders. The revolutionary history of any Republic of China in the world is like this. Why is this? Because human brains are very small. Why are brains so bad? It is because after thousands of years, there is religion. How does religion make human brains smaller? Religion cuts off the relationship between the natural world and human bodies and brains. When this relationship is cut off, human brains disappear. This explanation is a scientific explanation, because human brains depend on the body, and the body depends on the natural world. Without the natural world, there is no human body. Without the body, there is no brain. Brains that have nothing to do with the body and the natural world are always used up. Look at the bookworms. The deeper their knowledge, the more empty their talk. They say a lot of empty words, thinking that others cannot see the emptiness of their words. They only talk, and they don't talk about facts. They don't know how to talk about facts. They don't understand any facts. Because their brains are full of empty words, they can't talk about anything real. Now, we have reached a very important part of the speech. Human brains have reached the point where they are completely useless. If we know this, we can explain that "book" people, no matter what method they use, still have to look like they have brains, but they have no brains at all. They go to any place to find masks and use any method to make others not know that they have no experience. They have never seen animals, but they want to study zoology. The more they don't see animals, the more they want to study zoology. After studying, they know all the terms of zoology, and then others can't find out that they have never seen animals. There is nothing, but there are terms. Terms are like singing on stage, pretending to be something. The inside of the mask is not necessarily how it is, but from the outside, it looks very much like it. Mr. Hu Shidi has said about overthrowing the famous church, which can also prove that terms are the most dangerous masks for humans. For example, the more I have no thoughts, the more I use terms to cover up my lack of thoughts. Because terms come from books, the more I have no thoughts, the more I read books. If he doesn't read books, others can see that he has no thoughts, so he thinks that reading books is important. After reading European books, he knows Europe, because with books, others can't find out that I don't know anything about Europe. Plagiarizing other people's thoughts and picking up other people's experiences to replace their own thoughts and experiences. That is what books do, taking other people's thoughts and replacing their own thoughts, taking other people's experiences and replacing their own experiences. That is the purpose of reading books, so people generally admire [books] deeply. Thoughts can be dispensable, experiences can be dispensable, just use a little money to buy other people's thoughts and experiences, isn't that much more convenient? Using your own thoughts to find your own experiences takes so much effort. The body doesn't want to move, and the brain doesn't want to move either. Buy books to read and practice speaking. The less you know about things, the more you can talk. Isn't that good? Isn't that much more convenient? Going to investigate minerals? Too troublesome. You have to run around and be exposed to the sun. It's extremely annoying. It's better to buy a six-cent book on mineralogy and read it at home. It's much more convenient. According to what I just said, after religion eliminates people's brains, it still has to do a second [thing to make people not know that they have no brains], using books to make them look like they are replacing their thoughts and experiences. In this way, most people under religious culture never have a single thought in their lives. They always have books to replace their own thoughts, so they don't know at all that they have no thoughts. We can use an analogy to explain a biggest difficulty. For example, if I am sick, I know I am sick and can be treated. But if I am sick and don't know it, but think I am not sick, then there is nothing more dangerous than this. So the current young students go to class and read books in a careless way. Today they are students, and tomorrow they are teachers. Ask him [How is your brain? What do you think about?] The one being asked will ask you in return [Brain? What is brain?] He doesn't know anything about brains, because he has never used his brain at all when reading books. He has never used his own thoughts, only other people's thoughts. He has only read books and has never used his own thoughts, only other people's brains. Now education asks people to read books is a way to eliminate human brains. This is very dangerous. Selling girls to brothels is very wrong, but forcing men into study rooms is even worse. For example, prostitutes have very broken bodies, but they wear very good clothes, using the gorgeous clothes outside to cover up their broken bodies, just as students have a brain without thoughts, but steal very nice-sounding terms, using masked terms to cover up their empty brains. This is [the relationship between current education and books]. The first part of the speech is over. Now we are going to the second part of the speech [the relationship between future education and movies]. New education and scientific education do not exist in the world now. Why doesn't the new education of the scientific era exist now? Because the scientific era has not arrived yet. But we are people in the most important period of human history. What kind of people? People in the period when the religious era is beginning to prepare to become the past and transform into the scientific era. People who are thirty to forty years old or twenty to ten years old are still people of the religious era, but the dawn of the scientific era must be coming soon. Although scientific thought is very developed in the United States, the success of the scientific era is still out of the question. Scientific education does not exist anywhere. We in the moving educational experimental field invent and look for a path, which can also be said to be creating a path, because there is no prepared path. The scientific era has not arrived, so the education of the scientific era naturally does not exist. Now it is just a kind of hope, not something that has already been successful. The methods of preparing for the education of the scientific era are exactly the opposite of the old methods. The meaning of this scientific era is completely new. You cannot use your brain unless you use your body first. All activities must rely on the body. There cannot be internal arrangements without external stimulation. As soon as this is said, you can know why movies are so important in the new education of the scientific era. Movies always have things to stimulate you. There is never a time without stimulation [There cannot be brain activity without physical activity]. This can be proven in tomorrow's movie. Our sound movies tomorrow always have physical activity first, and then verbal activity. MARY DUOCAD, the starring actress in the movie, has very high-level performances. Before she speaks, she always has physical activity. For example, she scolds men for being useless and for bullying women. She has no degree of respect for women. She pushes him away. Her brain and her whole body have an attitude of looking down on men. Then she says, [You are all the same.] She first uses her whole body to fight, and then utters the words to overthrow them. You can see in the movie how these words come out of her body. Very few actors in the film industry can use this kind of performance. Her words clearly come out of her physical activities. Also, when she is on the ship, when her body is close to ALEENSOHD, she says "ISH U</p>
<p>MAKOYOUHAPPY, HAPPLERTHANANYOTHERWOMANEVERCOUTD" The activity of her speaking posture is before her voice even occurs. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e225">Camping <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— A-Lu</p>
<p>It was around Wednesday when a white paper with black text and a blue stamp, a children's notice, was posted on the patriotic bulletin board of our school:</p>
<p>[Tonight, the Boy Scouts will hold a camping trip. All members must gather at the large playground at 3:00 PM for inspection...]</p>
<p>Upon receiving this order, the Boy Scouts put on their uniforms in the morning. Before 3:00 PM, the playground was already filled with yellow soldiers. Usually, these girls are elegant and graceful, but today, they transformed into spirited and energetic "Eighth Masters," shouting and jumping, wielding sticks and axes. Their every move was just like soldiers. Who would recognize them as young ladies?</p>
<p>Around 3:00 PM, the loud bell rang more than twenty times. When the Yellow Team leader blew the whistle, the Boy Scouts immediately lined up facing south. At this moment, the large playground was silent except for the wind whistling through the treetops. Mr. Zhang Zhongren, the head of the Boy Scouts, came to inspect, just as soldiers wait for their superior officers. Mr. Zhang, accompanied by Mr. Sun, just walked onto the playground. The awaiting "little soldiers" all raised their sticks in salute.</p>
<p>After the inspection, the Yellow Team leader gave the order to set up camp at the designated campsite. They had to carry all the supplies themselves. It wasn't a problem for those with more strength, but the poor, weaker girls were all panting and out of breath. Although they felt tired, none of them were willing to fall behind. Everyone worked hard. In half an hour, the four large camps were completely set up. Then, some fetched water, some washed vegetables, some cooked rice, and some cooked dishes. Each task was clearly assigned. Even the toilet was prepared by some. When the food was ready, everyone sat on the ground to eat. Although the dishes were not great, they were driven by interest and didn't mind the poor quality of the food. Instead, they found it interesting. Usually, they couldn't finish two bowls, but today they ate three or four. Those who usually ate three or four bowls, needless to say.</p>
<p>The West Garden, which was usually deserted, suddenly became the center of excitement. The Boy Scouts not only occupied this wasteland, but other young ladies also came to join in the fun. One girl, facing the visiting classmates, shouted loudly, "Military camp, no unauthorized personnel allowed!" However, this attracted the attention of some mischievous young ladies. They bravely rushed forward and completely snatched away Xi's hat, food bag, etc. Later, Xi had to apologize to them several times to retrieve the stolen items.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about camping is raiding the camp, but it is also what they fear the most. Therefore, defensive measures were set up in front and behind the camp. When the camping order was first issued, many people wanted to raid the camp, but seeing their thorough defenses, everyone became fearful. In the end, only two people actually did it.</p>
<p>After twelve o'clock, the young ladies were all tired and one by one crawled into the tents to dream their dreams of fighting on the battlefield and charging to kill the enemy. Who would have thought that someone would come to steal things? Miss Yu, although young, was very brave. In the dark night, she walked alone into their camp to carry out her camp raid. Although Miss Yu was not born a thief, she had a wealth of knowledge about thieves. Before entering their camp, she first made some dog barks and then threw a handful of sand. Seeing that there was no reaction inside, she quietly entered and stole four or five items, returning peacefully.</p>
<p>Miss Yu, who came first, was victorious, but Mr. Sun, who came later, suffered a great loss. Mr. Sun not only lacked Miss Yu's carefulness, but also lacked the common sense of a thief. He wore loud leather shoes and carried a five-hundred-foot flashlight in his hand. Turning on the flashlight wasn't a problem, but his pair of noisy leather shoes had already alerted several people before he even stepped into the camp. They saw the flashlight and knew the camp raider was coming, but they remained silent, waiting for Mr. Sun to enter the camp to steal something. Just as he was about to take an item, the soldiers from the west camp had already surrounded him. When the siren blew, the other three camps all came out. At this time, Mr. Sun was helpless under the light of dozens of flashlights. The Yellow Team leader ordered someone to guard Mr. Sun while inspecting the items. As a result, they found that four items were missing and forced Mr. Sun to return the stolen items. At this time, Mr. Sun shouted that he was wronged, but the soldiers ignored whether he was wronged or not and kept forcing him to return the stolen items. Fortunately, the Yellow Team leader was wise and punished Mr. Sun lightly, letting him go.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Male and Female Students Fighting for Dorms at Labor University <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— You Wen</p>
<p>The campus of Jiangwan Labor University was originally the model factory. Because of the short construction time and the difficulty in building, the dormitories for both male and female students were modified from the existing factory buildings. There were many shortcomings, and the students naturally did not want to live there for a long time. Especially the female students' dormitory, each room accommodates more than ten people, and the noise is even more inconvenient.</p>
<p>This autumn, a magnificent and exquisite new dormitory was built, but it can only accommodate about one hundred people. The students of the Engineering College and the Social Sciences College began to compete for the ownership of the new building before the new building was completed. A group of female students also secretly lobbied the school authorities early on to allow the</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>half of the east end of the new dormitory downstairs to be used as a residence for female students. The school authorities did not clearly designate or announce this matter. However, the high wall in the middle of the back building indicated that everyone tacitly acknowledged this was the female students' dormitory. Because the allocation and disposal of dormitories were not easy, and the school itself was in trouble, the authorities did not have time to plan this matter. A brand new dormitory, which was the focus of everyone's attention, has been locked down by the "Iron General" until now.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday evening, around 9:00 PM, several students from the Engineering College suddenly decided to launch a "house-grabbing" movement. After breaking into the new building, all they saw was people moving boxes, taking quilts, and transporting things, like a scene of terror during a fire. In a short while, all the new rooms were fully occupied by those who were quick. The incident was initiated by the students of the Engineering College, and the students of the Social Sciences College were the ones who suffered. Because they received the news later, it was too late to act, and most of them could only look on with disappointment. However, some unwilling disappointed people, in a fit of anger, ignored everything and invaded the area of ​​the female students downstairs on the east end. They posted name cards on the doors of the rooms, made up the beds, and fell asleep, pretending to be the owners of the new rooms.</p>
<p>Of course, the female students were furious when they heard the news. They really thought this was a barbaric act of trampling on women's rights and despising female students, and they had to rise up to protest. Therefore, the next morning, several brave female students took advantage of the male students' sweet dreams and suddenly broke into the rooms, tore up the name cards on the doors, and moved in their own boxes, baskets, and other items, throwing the male students' things aside, indicating that they were asking the male students to get out. Thus, the dispute over housing arose.</p>
<p>After a long debate, the two sides could not resolve the issue. Both sides' arguments had seemingly reasonable grounds. The female students said, "This is clearly a female dormitory acknowledged by the school authorities. Otherwise, why would they build that wall in the middle? And everyone generally recognizes that male and female students should live separately. What reason is there to mix into our dormitory?" The male students also raised three points to refute, saying, "First, the school authorities did not clearly designate or announce that this was a female dormitory. The wall built in the middle is not necessarily a sign of separation between men and women. Aren't there also partition walls in our male students' old dormitories (the partition wall between the Social Sciences College and the Engineering College)? Second, according to the principle of equal opportunity, in the situation last night, every member of Labor University had the opportunity to grab a new room, and the gains and losses should be attributed to their own skills. Female and male students are both members of Labor University. Third, and moreover, Labor University is a revolutionary school that stands before the times. In the past, there has never been a boundary between male and female students. Working, attending classes, and eating have always been mixed together. Why should living be an exception?"</p>
<p>This kind of debate would of course not have good results. Although later, the more gentle male and female students were willing to withdraw, the main forces of both sides were unwilling to give up. Therefore, a situation of mixed male and female living was successfully created. Some of the more courageous female students, ignoring the male students' encirclement, bravely lived alone or two or three people in a room. It is said that the most commendable among them is the "Da Wu Wei" (Great Fearless) lady. She actually embraced her usual "Da Wu Wei" spirit, went alone (living in a room by herself), deeply surrounded, and resisted effectively, with her spirit always undiminished. This has become the current housing unsolved case of Labor University.</p>
<p>After this incident, it attracted many onlookers from outside the school to visit, some praising and some criticizing. However, the school's guidance class ultimately believed that this was not very convenient, and that over time, it would cause trouble and would not be good for the school's reputation. Therefore, they ordered the male students to voluntarily withdraw, but the male students put forward a condition, which was to order all the students occupying the new dormitory to withdraw together, and then use a lottery method to determine each person's room, and then they would agree to withdraw from the female students' dormitory. However, this matter was very difficult.</p>
<p>With no other choice, the guidance class could only issue a notice acknowledging that the unauthorized move to the new dormitory was invalid. As for the allocation issue, it would be replanned after the new president arrived at the school. However, mixed male and female living is still a fact.</p>

<h3 id="e228">Random Talks on the German Theater Scene <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Stepped Stage and Expressionist Director Aisner</p>
<p>Aisner is the stage director of the National Theatre. His stage is the opposite of the soft colors, lyrical poetry, and fairy-tale style stages favored by Reinhardt. He loves to use straight lines and strong colors to express a kind of clear simplicity. He newly created a stage setting for Shakespearean plays, using steps to control the complex scenes unique to Shakespearean plays. Therefore, when people talk about him now, they think of the stepped stage. Recently, he adapted Aitken's [Earth Spirit] into a film. In the third act, he set up many steps as usual.</p>
<p>In the play [Richard III], the dark stage is covered with red steps. The bedroom scene in [Othello] has a white curtain hanging in the center of the dark stage, along with a bed. A white candlestick is placed on the left. This is the bed of the black protagonist in white. This bed is made of four sections of steps. The whole stage can achieve a simple black and white taste, which is a very impressive device. His unique style can achieve a very effect in Shakespeare's military dramas or crowd dramas. The helmets or flags of the soldiers move under the steps. Two or three ancient warriors rise or fall from the steps, which is a very expression of the power of the crowd, which is incomparable to the stupid method of using many disorderly crowds to express it.</p>
<p>The masterpiece that best represents Aisner's set design is the stage surface of Aitken's [Count Fontancreat]. In a room surrounded by white screens, the very thin, straight-legged chairs are all black. The costumes of the characters on stage are also all black. The male protagonist's clothing style has sharp angles on the shoulders and is triangular from the waist down. The female's clothing style is all straight lines. The color is only black and white, except for the hair on the head, which is dazzling gold. The movements of the actors also all take straight-line movements. In a certain scene of this play, you can hear the music of a garden party. This is the musicalization of Expressionist painting, which makes people feel the emotion of seeing the paintings of Expressionist painter Beckmann.</p>
<p>He has always used the name [Young Stage] to put on second performances with the aim of recommending the scripts of unknown writers. The play list is [People Above Demons], and the performance method is completely Expressionist.</p>
<p>The product color of the Expressionist stage is the fragrance of art wandering in the middle. Expressionist drama has been successful, and Aisner's simplicity has also been successful. This is also the reason why Aisner's name and Expressionist drama will be immortal.</p>
<p>The Difficulty of German Theater Scripts</p>
<p>When Halink's [Murder] and Kaiser's [Two Olives] lonely decorated the Expressionist drama scene, it was difficult to find anything more outstanding in the German theater scene for a while. Although there were [Blunner], [Brecht], and [Chaplin]'s author Fischer and [Drunken Boat]'s author Zacchi and sculptor Barlach developing with [Young Stage], they did not give the theater scene anything new. Even the venerable author Waller of [Collective Human Beings], although he was out of prison, only wrote poetry and did not see his activities on the theater scene.</p>
<p>In recent years, foreign scripts have been rampant on the German theater scene. The first to be proud was Pirandello, who led his own troupe to Germany, making the whole of Germany admire his works for a time. His works were often performed in more than ten places. [Honesty is Joy] was performed in thirty-one places. [Man, Animal and Virtue] was performed in fifteen places. The name of [Six Characters in Search of an Author] has become a popular idiom in Germany. The famous theater critic Karl Jakob expressed his difficulty in the lack of German writers and specially wrote an article titled [Six Million People in Search of an Author] to express his feelings. Six million is exactly the total population of Germany.</p>
<p>Following Pirandello was Shaw, and then O'Neill. In addition to these works by English, American, and Italian writers, Chinese plays based on Eastern themes have become popular on the theater scene. [Chulanji] made by Grabent was performed at the [German Theatre] by Reinhardt, and later it was performed in various cities. Reinhardt's interest in Chinese plays is a continuation of his inherent Romanticism, not purely his exotic taste. When he revived Mozart's musical dance drama [The Magic Flute], he took many patterns from Chinese lacquerware on the stage. [Chulanji] is regarded as his second work of Chinese taste. The heroine in this play is Bai Kulei, who became famous for acting Shaw's script. Many places on the stage of this play imitate Japanese Kabuki, such as using bright peach blossoms and red short machines and wide sleeves to express Oriental taste. These are not Chinese but Japanese, and the words [Ogami Lantern] are written on the lanterns on the stage, but they are the lanterns used in Japanese shrines. This is the place where Reinhardt made a mistake.</p>
<p>In addition to [Chulanji]'s Chinese plays, there are also Piercey's [Dong Luo] and the opera [Li Taibai Divine Duck], etc., but none of them are as sad as [Chulanji]. No wonder [Chulanji] is so popular in Germany.</p>
<p>In the midst of such a voice of German writers' lack of success, Crosman, who became famous as a teenager, was expressed. He is the son of the old writer Thomas Mann. When his [Anja and Estelle] was performed in Hamburg, the two heroines were Mamera, the surviving daughter of Aitken, and Eliga, the daughter of Thomas Mann and the sister of the author. The author's acting of the bloodline has become a very interesting thing at the time.</p>
<p>The German theater scene, which was warned by Karl that [Six Million People in Search of an Author], will not always be so lonely (Su).</p>

<p>— Lin Yong</p>
<p>Tokyo Communication</p>
<p>This is something worthy of our attention</p>
<p>It was during the break time that I also put down my paintbrush. In a very short time, I had to run to the newspaper reading room to find the news that was announced yesterday. Sure enough, a very noteworthy piece of news caught my attention. Indeed, this piece of news is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>This is the Nika Association, the highest authority of the Japanese field art group. It burst. The Nika Association's burst is a tragic history of the Nika Association, and a little bit of light in the Japanese art world. Because the parts that burst out are all important painters in the Nika Association, and they are the radical vanguards of the Japanese art world.</p>
<p>The Nika Association can compete with the Imperial Art because it is all about the times and the super-era expression, and the strong resistance to the imitation and rules of the enemy. But unfortunately, the Nika Association burst. It burst after the 17th exhibition.</p>
<p>Although the reduction of the Nika Association group's strength is common, the joiners are always stronger than the leavers. Now, the loss is indeed very light. It is difficult to predict whether the joiners in the future will be as strong and brave as the leavers. Perhaps Nika will be weaker from now on. But the Nika Association, which has already obtained more than ten years of old history in the Japanese art world, cannot be easily weakened, I think.</p>
<p>Japanese people like to come up with strange and novel things. However, a group of Nika Associations running in front of the Japanese modern art world, their vanguards ran away, ran out of the scope of the Nika Association, and went to chase their own goals. The vanguard beast group, how sad is this for the Nika Association, which has the power to resist the Imperial Academy of Art? If Nika wants to continue its original glory and strength, unless it continues to work hard and carefully to seek out that hardworking and intelligent writer.</p>
<p>This group of radical writers of the Nika Association, this beast group, they gathered the famous generals of other associations and inserted a [Independent Art Association] on the Japanese art scene. This is because they each already shone like stars in the sky on the Japanese art scene.</p>
<p>If their strength is insufficient and their efforts are not strong and then they fall, then there is no saying that is natural. But the strength of this group is indeed not thin. They are all the main writers of Nika, and they are one-third of the main writers of the Nika Association, and they are all the vanguards of Nika.</p>
<p>The works of this beast group are running to the forefront of Japanese modern society. They are expressions of ridicule, resistance, ugliness, and escape. They are strong impulsive silver.</p>
<p>The initiators of this [Independent Art Association] are Katsuzo Satomi, Yoshizo Kojima, Nika Association members Shigeyoshi Hayashi, Takeshi Hayashi, Takashi Nakayama, Afu Suzuki, Zentaro Kojima, Yasutoku Suzuki, Nika Association member Kawaguchi Kiga, Toji Shimizu, and Ren Ito. They are the winners of this year's Nika Association, saving the rest. One is a non-reviewed member of the Shunyo Association and one is a member of the Diet. The first exhibition will be held on January 10 next year. Wait and see.</p>
<p>Most of them withdrew from the 1930 Art Association and joined the Nika Association last year. This 1930 Art Association was also a very powerful group in Japan. However, since the split last year, since the death of a pillar, Kiyokawa Zenji, this year, it has sunk to seeming to be destroyed. Therefore, in this prosperous period of the Nika Association, this group has withdrawn again. This Nika Association in the future is very worthy of our attention, and the Imperial Academy of Art has suddenly collided with a powerful field group, which is also the same worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>I wrote this completely as a report, a report to my dear art teachers and friends.</p>
<p>Now the teachers in the school have told me that they are very alarmed and sighing, and even outsiders are generally very surprised.</p>
