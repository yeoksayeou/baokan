<p>Nanjing: Negotiations on the abolition of the waterline treaty have been held repeatedly, but only the Shanghai-Yantai-Guda part has been resolved. Our side is preparing funds to take back the management. The funds have been prepared. Regarding the rights to receive and send international mail, landing rights, and beach reporting fees, the company is very contentious and there has been no substantial result. However, our side will definitely safeguard sovereignty and expand autonomous international radio stations as much as possible to increase efficiency. We will also first strengthen the domestic power lines to restore their original state and gradually expand them, all from a proactive perspective to avoid long-term loss of sovereignty. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The situation is quite stalled after the waterline negotiations stopped. Our side insists on not giving in. It is reported that regarding the right to receive and send mail, our side advocates for the full recovery of the main operating rights, which can be managed by the company. The company does not want overseas reporting fees to be returned to China, but the company only allows for Europe to return 42 to 45 cents per word, and the Americas to return 52 cents. Our side advocates for Europe to be 60 cents and America to be 70 cents. The other party uses the excuse that the contract has not been signed and the time limit has not been agreed upon. Our side insists that it must be resolved this year. Otherwise, the Wusong-Baoshan section of the waterline landing ground line was purchased by the Chinese government early on, and the final method will be taken at that time, even if the power cord is cut off.

<h3 id="e10">The World Sugar Industry's Restriction Law <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>At a time when the economic tide is becoming increasingly severe, and the trend of gold being expensive and silver being cheap is still advancing daily, the purchasing power of various countries is becoming increasingly depleted, and it is becoming more difficult to sell goods. Therefore, it is better to work with other countries to devise good methods to maintain the overall situation than to compete commercially with other countries to save oneself. The World Sugar Industry Conference, in view of the wave of panic in the sugar industry, investigated the amount of sugar needed in the world and the amount of sugar produced, and distributed it to sugar-producing countries, limiting the amount of exports to a certain number. Countries can then manufacture products according to the amount. If there is surplus capacity, it can be used for other industries. At the time of setting export quotas in this conference, it is inevitable that there will be difficulties in averaging and disputes over who gets more and who gets less. However, in the future, the disadvantages of unlimited exports can be avoided and the losses of congestion and unsalable goods can be reduced. The panic of today's world commercial downturn is all because countries only know to maximize manufacturing, compete for exports, and once they encounter stagnation, they try every means to compete with others, hoping to break through this difficult situation alone. They do not know that other countries have the same mentality, then the world's goods will become increasingly oversupplied and the losses will become increasingly large. The advantages and disadvantages of this need not be explored in depth. If the major industrial countries can first comprehensively plan and investigate the number of needs in the world, and the industrial groups can connect to determine a standard for the number of production, and each leave room to restrict their own manufacturing, so that various goods do not accumulate more and more to form this stagnant scene, then the panic of world commerce will not be as severe as it is today. Therefore, I said that the sugar industry council's restriction method is actually one of the passive good methods to save commerce in the absence of methods. Furthermore, the reason why the price of silver has continued to decline and become the crisis of today is largely because silver-producing countries have not imposed restrictions. The reason why silver production has not been restricted is because silver-producing countries are unwilling to sacrifice themselves slightly to maintain the overall situation. This can also be used as evidence of the above statement.</p>

<p>Occupation of Jaca Gaining Momentum, Government Declares Sufficient Power to Quell the Disturbance</p>
<p>London, December 12th, Reuters - According to reports from Hendaye, a disturbance has occurred in Spain. It is related to the escape from prison of the famous aviator Franco. Citizens and soldiers in Jaca, Aragon province, have revolted. The cabinet has convened an emergency meeting. Squadrons of aircraft and several battalions of troops are en route to Jaca. Security is tight in Madrid. Prime Minister Berenguer claims the disturbance is not of great importance.</p>

They have requisitioned all vehicles in the town and dispatched troops towards Huesca. Reports indicate they have engaged with government forces, with numerous casualties on both sides. The rebels arrested the provincial governor and deputy governor who were investigating the situation in Jaca, and detained the bishop of Jaca as a hostage.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Broadcasting Important Declaration <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Promoting a Policy of Peace, Expressing Support for France</p>
<p>Warsaw - The Polish Foreign Minister, Zaleski, broadcast his declaration via radio on the 5th, stating that the Polish government's foreign policy will prioritize peace. "We constantly oppose the tendency towards war and never covet the territory of other nations. We are always prepared to support any effort to consolidate peace, as the world has seen. However, every nation's spirit of peace is naturally limited by its defense needs. If our country were to use force to prove the righteousness of its principles, every sober nation would only respond with war. Therefore, I believe that to consolidate peace, we must organize the world so that any nation can secure its confidence. If any nation dares to initiate a new war against humanity, other nations should rise up to defend the victim of aggression. Poland has earnestly advocated disarmament in Geneva, but it should be preceded by sufficient security guarantees for all nations, so that the principle of mutual trust between nations can be established. For this reason, the Polish government firmly believes that the reorganization of the post-war world is a fundamental condition for consolidating peace, and therefore actively participates in the work of the League of Nations, whose main task is to organize all nations for peaceful cooperation and to maintain the status quo. The Polish government, for the same reason, fully supports France's initiative to organize a European Union. In summary, the consolidation of peace, the maintenance of existing borders, and the preservation of the rights Poland has obtained from treaties are the two major foundations of our foreign policy."</p>
<h3 id="e51">World Silver Market Continues to Decline <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Root Cause...</p>
<p>Due to Overproduction and a Sharp Decrease in Demand</p>
<p>Tokyo, December 13th, Japan United Press - The decline in silver prices seems unstoppable. According to foreign dispatches received today, London is at 15 1/16 pence and New York is at 32 1/2. Silver prices have fallen to unprecedented levels. It is difficult to predict how far they will fall in the future. The fundamental cause of the silver decline is the unchecked increase in silver bullion production, coupled with a sharp decrease in demand for silver coins. There has been no change in the demand for silver in art and crafts. Silver prices in the banking sector are determined solely by supply and demand. The direct cause is the low prices and sluggish sales of Chinese agricultural products, which have led to an excess of silver in Shanghai. In addition, the sluggishness of India's foreign trade has reduced the demand for silver. The United States is suffering from overproduction of silver. European and American countries are currently studying solutions to silver overproduction and market regulation policies. Several proposals have been made, but they all require international coordination and are therefore extremely difficult to implement.</p>

<p>Several More Banks Collapse, Berlin Stock Market Affected</p>
<p>New York, December 12th, Reuters - Several more banks across the country have collapsed after bank runs, and three banks have suspended withdrawals for a month. Vice President of the Irvington Bank and Vice President and Accountant of the Columbus Savings Bank, Willard, committed suicide.</p>
<p>Washington, December 12th, Reuters - Yesterday, there were many depositors gathered outside the closed branches of the United States Bank, but today there are few, as the police advised that waiting was futile, so most dispersed. A major depositor has filed a lawsuit to recover deposits of $1.5 million. The New York Stock Exchange opened today with a calm atmosphere. Security prices are stable. The market does not seem to be affected by the closure of the United States Bank. The bank has no connection with the US government. Sources in the banking industry say that New York bankers believe that the closure of the United States Bank is an isolated incident that does not involve the public, so there is no need for the financial community to panic, and the general public also seems to hold this view, as other banks have not detected any signs of unease among their depositors.</p>
<p>Washington, December 12th, Reuters - A special committee of the Senate will begin investigating the state of banking operations in January.</p>
<p>Berlin, December 12th, National News Agency - At the Berlin Stock Exchange, with the exception of bank and shipping stocks, opening and closing prices were generally weak. The devaluation of electrical stocks was particularly severe. AEG and German General Electric stocks both fell to face value, and Siemens stocks also reached unprecedented lows. The main reason is the large number of short positions and the sale of German stocks by a major American bank after a bank run, so these stocks are expected to rebound soon.</p>

The remaining two companies of French soldiers and forty Belgian soldiers of the railway guard departed for home immediately after the flag removal. However, the Saar region is nominally still under the jurisdiction of the League of Nations, but in reality is controlled by France. According to the Treaty of Versailles, a national assembly must be convened after five years to decide its allegiance. Germany and France previously negotiated a return, but negotiations were suspended because the German government could not accept France's demand for shared ownership of mineral resources. Currently, people from both countries still hope that they will resume soon.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Indian Federation Plan <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Structure Subcommittee Submits Interim Report, British Prime Minister Rebukes Churchill's Remarks as Unwise</p>
<p>London, December 13th, Reuters - The Federation Structure Subcommittee of the Indian Round Table Conference has submitted an interim report on the Federation Plan, proposing to transfer the powers that the Indian princes can cede to the British Emperor and the existing powers of the Indian government to the new Federation, so that the powers of both sides can form the new state. It is expected that the federation system will be implemented in the British Indian provinces and the Indian princely states that are willing to join the federation. The federation should adopt a bicameral system, with the number of representatives from British India and the princely states determined proportionally. Matters relating only to British India seem to be handled by another parliament. However, this approach is indeed novel and must be carefully considered. Therefore, the representatives of the princely states in the federal parliament will have no connection with matters handled by another parliament. As for important issues related to the British Emperor, it must be further studied when discussing the relationship between the federal executive leader and the British Emperor. If matters such as national defense and diplomacy are reserved for handling by the British Emperor, the British Emperor's representatives will need to attend both houses. The report is followed by a table listing the matters that are temporarily considered federal.</p>
<p>London, December 12th, Reuters - British Prime Minister MacDonald refuted Churchill's remarks on the Indian issue last night in a speech in Leeding, saying that these remarks lacked wisdom and were not cautious, and were not constructive and could be disastrous. What he said was only an inappropriate relationship between the imperial authorities and the governed people, and nothing else. He was blind to the new political movement and still wanted to force the Indian people who had cultivated their political aspirations. The Indian National Congress and other parties whose aspirations were round table conference failures will now be grateful to Churchill for giving him the opportunity to stir up Indian prejudice and oppose the British Emperor. The government has now gained the support of Indian public opinion, so it may as well listen to Churchill's remarks, but if Churchill listens to advice, he will not do it again in the future.</p>

<p>Washington, December 12th, Associated Press - President Hoover met with Republican leaders at the White House today to discuss how to deal with Congress. The reason why Hoover and Congress are not in harmony is that the two sides disagree on relief funding. Hoover stated to the Republican leaders at today's meeting that the Senate should stipulate relief funding within the limits set by Hoover, and the senators also stated that Hoover's views on this case should be changed to the majority opinion of the Senate, and the relief work would not be interrupted because Hoover did not approve of it. According to veterans in the political arena, the White House and Congress will soon become deadlocked due to mutual contention, which will eventually lead to Hoover using his special power of veto to prevent relief funding from exceeding the budget.</p>

What was discovered was the remains of an infant, whose height was six feet eight inches. Scientists have previously found three skeletons of giants near this location, from which it can be inferred that this place must have been the burial place of ancient giants at that time.

<p>Gansu Relief Committee Telegram to Shanghai Shen Bao:</p>
<p>Since the earthquake in Gansu in the ninth year of the Republic (1920), the province has not recovered. In recent years, disasters have been frequent. Millions of people have died from war, plague, freezing, and famine. This year, in counties such as Gangu, Wushan, Qin'an, Xihe, and Xigu, the wind god has wreaked havoc, and the ears of wheat have withered and died in a few days. In Lintao and Dingxi, hail has caused disaster, and the harvested crops have been almost destroyed in a moment. In Gaolan, Jingyuan, Huining, Yuzhong, and other counties, there was a severe drought in the summer, and the fertile fields cracked like turtle shells. In the autumn, there was a severe frost, and the crops were withered. Yongdeng, Yongjing, Longxi, Dingxi, and the northern border of Huan County were ravaged as if the fields were cut. Swarms of five-colored rats are unprecedented in ancient and modern times. In counties such as Jinta and Shandan, there are both drought and banditry. Refugees are everywhere. In Zhang County, Yanjing, Peijiabao, Wushan, Xiejiaping, Gangu Pan'an Town, Lintao Guanbao, and other places, hundreds of innocent people were killed by bandits in May and June. The damage caused by the loss of other county towns, massacres, looting, etc. is even greater. In famine years, grain prices soar, and the sound of sorrowful cries echoes in the central marshes. Bandits are rampant, and soldiers are fierce. Isolated swallows lose their forest homes. The number of famine victims gathered in the provincial capital is even greater than last year. Various counties are requesting relief one after another. What tactics can be used to deal with this? Only humbly request your newspaper to publicize it on our behalf, so as to appeal to the public so that benevolent assistance and righteous grains can benefit the remnants. We are overwhelmed with urgent gratitude.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Chairman Chiang Departs Nanchang for Lushan <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>He, Lu, and Other Generals Immediately Return to Defense</p>
<p>Chiang's Overall Response to Petitioning Citizens</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence - Chairman Chiang departed from the province for Xun today (the 11th) and then went to Lushan for a day or two of sightseeing before going to Hankou. It is said that Chairman Chiang is eager to return to Nanjing as New Year's Day is approaching. After arriving in Hankou, he may suspend his trip to Hunan. He Jian was summoned to Hankou to be personally instructed on everything. Only Shao Lizi and Zhou Fohai accompanied Chiang to Lushan. Personnel from various offices of the headquarters went directly to Hankou. The details of Chiang's departure for Lushan are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Grand Occasion of Departure from the Province - Chiang got up very early this morning. Because people from all walks of life did not get prior notice, there were fewer people to see him off. Military and political dignitaries, such as Commanders Lu and Zhu, and Division Commanders Zhang and Gong, all arrived at the Baihuazhou headquarters first to wait. Commissioners from the Provincial Party Department, the Provincial Government, and leaders of various agencies went directly to the Niu Hang Station to wait. This morning, from Zhongshan Road to Yanjiang Road to Niu Hang Station, military and police were densely deployed and security was extremely tight. At half past seven, Chairman Chiang, accompanied by He Chengjun, Shao Lizi, Zhou Fohai, and dozens of staff members from the headquarters, left the headquarters in more than a dozen cars. Lu and others also followed in cars. When they arrived at the Zhangwai River embankment, they fired a 21-gun salute. The welcomers took off their hats and paid their respects. Chiang, He, and others got out of the car at the crossing and boarded a ferry across the river to the Niu Hang Station and boarded the train. Commanders Lu, Zhu, Zhang, and Gong all went to the train to say goodbye to Chiang and He. At about eight o'clock, the welcomers got off the train, and the special train left for Jiujiang amidst military music.</p>
<p>Generals Return to Defense - Chief He and Commander Lu originally planned to accompany Chiang to Lushan for a visit. Later, because of the importance of the military affairs of suppressing the bandits, they did not succeed. After arriving in Xun, He returned to Hankou by warship without delay. Lu also made some deployments in the province and led the Ninth Route Army headquarters to Ji. Division Commanders Zhang and Gong are scheduled to return to their original defenses tomorrow and work hard to clear the area. However, Deng Ying, the commander of the New 13th Division, was dismissed by Chiang for the loss of Ji'an some time ago and handed over to the Ninth Route Army headquarters for discussion. Peng Xueyou, the magistrate of Ji'an County, was also escorted to the province for punishment to appease the people of Ji'an and to serve as a warning. Regarding the position of commander of the New 13th Division, Chiang sent Lu Xiaochen to Fuzhou to take over.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's Remarks - Chairman Chiang made the following remarks regarding the petitions of the people of Jiangxi: "I have received many petitions from Jiangxi compatriots during this trip to Gan, and after reviewing them, I have learned about the recent situation in Jiangxi and the hopes of the people. The government should try its best to accommodate the demands of the people within the possible scope, but there are also those that are not permitted by the environment or that the government is currently unable to achieve. The people must also put themselves in the government's position and consider the government's situation, and should not make extravagant demands. Summarizing the petitions from various parties, the important ones are nothing more than the following three points, which are explained separately: (1) I have heard that some people are dissatisfied with the Jiangxi Provincial Government and are criticizing Chairman Lu and Division Commander Zhang. It must be known that the Communist bandits in Gansu are so rampant. The military strength in Gansu is so weak. The area of ​​Gansu is so vast, and Chairman Lu is able to protect most of the important cities in Jiangxi with a very small number of troops. It cannot be said that he is not fulfilling his responsibilities, nor can it be said that he is not responding appropriately. It must be known that the work of suppressing the Communists can only succeed if the officials and the people cooperate effectively. If the people do not fulfill their responsibilities and do not do their best, but only know how to rely on the government and even criticize the individuals in charge of the government, then no matter how hard the government authorities work and how diligently they fulfill their duties, they will not be able to achieve the effect of suppressing the Communists. Therefore, the people of Jiangxi should understand the government's difficult situation and understand the importance of their own qualifications. They should change their passive attitude of relying on the government and criticizing the government, and adopt a positive attitude of assisting the government and working hard on their own. Then, with the joint efforts of officials and people, the Communist bandits will not be difficult to suppress, and the people of Jiangxi can conceive of a happy life of peace and industry. (2) My only task in coming to Gan this time is to suppress the Communists. The disaster situation in Jiangxi, where the Communist bandits have ravaged the land, is extremely serious. The government should provide relief. However, the government's current responsibility is to use its full strength to suppress the Communists, in other words, to use its full strength to liberate the people oppressed by the Communist bandits and to rescue the areas ravaged by the Communist bandits. In order to achieve the goal of suppressing the Communists, it is not enough to raise military expenses. At this time of financial hardship, the government cannot raise a large amount of relief funds in addition to military salaries, nor can it transfer military expenses for relief funds. Although the State Council previously approved 8 million yuan in relief funds for Shaanxi, it has not been possible to raise funds to this day due to the government's inability to do so. Mr. Yu Youren's trip to Shaanxi only brought more than 100,000 yuan in relief funds. However, the government will never ignore the disaster situation in Gansu. I will normally allocate 100,000 yuan from the military expenses I brought to Gan for relief efforts in Jiangxi. I know that this is a drop in the bucket and will not help much, but it is only to express the government's concern for the disaster in Gan. The people of Jiangxi should understand that the current priority is to actively raise military expenses and suppress the Communists, and not to start from the negative side. I sincerely hope that people with resources and wealth in various places will come forward to take responsibility, contribute their wealth and do their best to assist the government, and use the power of society to carry out large-scale relief donations. Then, by gathering small things to make big things, and accumulating earth to make mountains, it is not entirely impossible, depending on the efforts of the compatriots. (3) It is a matter of course that education funds should be independent. However, Jiangxi currently has a special situation. The Communist bandits are rampant, and alerts are being issued everywhere. Local income is mostly cut off, and the provincial government's income has decreased while expenditures remain the same. Therefore, the arrears of education funds are an inevitable phenomenon in fact. My colleagues in the education sector are all intellectuals and should know that in the current period of suppressing the Communists, my farmers, industrialists, merchants, students, and soldiers should all endure temporary suffering. The entire body is mobilized to use its full strength to suppress the Communists. All construction projects must wait until the Communists are suppressed before there can be development. If my colleagues in the education sector express dissatisfaction due to short-term arrears of wages, then how will the officers and soldiers who give their lives and throw their heads to suppress the Communists, who are still inevitably owed wages, fare? My colleagues in the education sector should know that the responsibility of suppressing the Communists is by no means lighter for the education sector than for the military. Since the military is suffering in the front, how can my education sector bear to be alone? Once the Communists are suppressed and society is stable, the local finances will be unified, income will increase, and education funds will not be lacking. Therefore, the independence of Jiangxi's education funds should be maintained and the original plan should be guaranteed. However, in the event that there are temporary difficulties in practice during the period of suppressing the Communists, it is also hoped that my colleagues in the education sector will endure temporary suffering and understand the government's environment. I have come to Gan this time with a twelve-point determination and effort to suppress the Communists to save my people in Jiangxi. This is enough to comfort my compatriots. However, the people of Jiangxi should also assist the government and assist the army with a twelve-point determination and effort to achieve the complete success of suppressing the Communists. It is best not to be disappointed or resentful with the government because of the transitional period, where the government may not be able to fully satisfy people's wishes." (December 11)</p>

<p>Deng Ying Is Dismissed and Punished for Ineffective Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence - After Deng Ying, the commander of the New 13th Division, was transferred from Hubei to Gan, he was stationed near Ji'an, and he built strong trenches and electric fences, which could be firmly defended. However, on October 2, when Zhu Mao advanced into Ji'an from Lianhua and Yongxin, Deng did not fire a shot and retreated, causing Ji'an to be easily obtained by the bandits. The essence of more than a dozen counties in western Gan has been wiped out. After investigation, it was confirmed that the Communist bandits killed more than 10,000 people in Ji'an and burned and destroyed houses, causing losses of property that are difficult to calculate. Moreover, after the loss of Ji'an, Deng's division was stationed in Fuzhou, and the loss of Yihuang and Le'an was like watching a fire from across the river and not moving. Nearly two regiments of the division stationed in Chongren, with several Communist bandits' handguns, also entered the city safely, and the officers and soldiers did not resist at all. In early November, when Zhu Mao planned to attack Fuzhou from Chongyi, Deng Ying wanted to abandon Fuzhou again without thinking about blocking the attack, causing the Communist bandits to advance to more than twenty miles from the county town of Linchuan, near Dundu and Liufang. Fortunately, Wang Zhenhuan, the county magistrate of the county, maintained his composure and supervised the Zhou team leader to defend firmly, so it did not waver. Unexpectedly, Deng Ying declared to Magistrate Wang that he would not fight the bandits without 50,000 yuan. After getting the money, he demolished dozens of shops in Linchuan Wenchang Bridge and Hedong Bay. All these perverse acts are difficult to record. After Chairman Chiang arrived in Gan, the people of Ji'an complained to Chiang about Deng's various illegal acts. The important points are: (1) When in Ji, residents in the county had to obtain a pass from the division headquarters, each costing one yuan or one thousand cash. Deng also borrowed rent from the business community for several months and extorted donations, and the income from the search was no less than 100,000 yuan. (2) If there was a young girl in a civilian family, Deng would always ask her for pleasure. If he did not succeed, he would falsely accuse her of being a Communist bandit and arrest her and imprison her. There were also those who could not bear his oppression and allowed him to destroy them. (3) When the Communist bandits advanced to more than ten miles from the city of Ji, Deng was still patting his chest to the representatives of all walks of life and was responsible for keeping the city. The words were still in his ears, but the entire army fled in the dark night, causing more than 100,000 people in the city of Ji to not know where to die. (4) He indulged his soldiers in disturbing the residents. For example, when he was in Fu, he cut open more than a dozen suitcases of a resident named Jiang in the name of inspection and looted his valuables. (5) Deng's troops were extremely undisciplined. For example, when he was in Fu, there were those who openly raped women, and Deng ignored it. (6) Deng brought three or four concubines with him when he supervised the division in Fu. The rest are difficult to describe. After Chiang obtained dozens of petitions and reports from various parties, he was shocked and immediately summoned Deng to the province. When Deng arrived in the province from Fu on the evening of the 9th and met General Commander Chiang, Chiang immediately dismissed Deng from his position and ordered him to be arrested and handed over to the Ninth Route Army Command for custody to await strict legal punishment. In addition, Peng Xueyou, the magistrate of Ji'an County, has also been escorted to the province to be punished for the crime of dereliction of duty and harming the people. After Chiang dismissed Deng, he appointed Lu Xiaochen, the current member of the Gan Provincial Government and senior advisor to the Ninth Route Army, as the commander of the New 13th Division.</p>
<p>The Third Division is mostly the old department of various routes. After Lu was appointed, he rushed to Fuzhou on the morning of the 13th after sending Chiang to Xun, leading the security team, guards, and many attendants to take over the affairs. There are divisions of Mao Bingwen, Tan Daoyuan, etc. in Fuzhou, which can be safely received. In addition, after Chiang dismissed Deng, he telegraphed to the commanders of various routes to show military discipline and to warn them. The original telegram reads:</p>
<p>"He, Deputy Director of the Headquarters, Commander He, General Commander Chiang, Commander Lu, Commander Zhu, Xunjian, Deng Ying, the commander of the New 13th Division, was cowardly and did not move forward in suppressing the bandits in western Gansu. He abandoned Ji'an without orders, causing the Communist bandits to kill and slaughter the people, who were in dire straits. If he is not severely punished according to law, it is not enough to promote law and order and thank the people. In addition to being dismissed from his position and arrested for strict legal punishment, he should also order his subordinates to know the importance of being one." (December 12)</p>
<h3 id="e62">He Jian Arrives in Hankou <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: He Jian, the General Commander of the Fourth Route Army and concurrently Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, arrived in Hubei on the afternoon of the 11th at 2:00 PM via special express train from Hunan, as General Commander Chiang was soon to arrive in Hankou. He arrived at the Gu Yu Tao train station in Wuchang at 10:00 AM on the 12th. Accompanying him were Huang Weihan, the Chief of Staff of the Fourth Route Army; Ling Daru, the Secretary; Hu Yinhuai, the Director of Public Relations; and He Zuan, Yang Xunqin, and over ten other representatives from the Hunan Province Compatriot Women's Disaster Relief Fundraising Group. Waiting at the station to welcome him were Xia Douyin, Liu Wendao, and others. After alighting from the train, He Jian crossed the river and resided at the Fourth Route Army's office in Hankou. I ventured to visit him and inquired about the recent situation regarding the suppression of bandits. He Jian stated that Hunan Province had suffered the most from banditry. However, after vigorous suppression by various armies, the main force of the bandits had been defeated, leaving only scattered small groups. Recently, in the Pingjiang area, Kong Hechong's bandit units had been successively attacked by the troops led by Liu Jianxu, the Army Commander, and under the command of Wang Dongyuan and Tao Guang, with victories achieved in Jia Yi and Changshou. The bandits had built strong fortifications near Changshou, which our army broke through after several days and nights of bloody hand-to-hand combat. Furthermore, continuous bombing by the air force resulted in the death of over a thousand bandits, with countless wounded. The remaining bandits are now fleeing towards Tonggu and Xiushui in western Jiangxi. Our army is continuing to pursue and attack them, while Jiangxi Province troops are blocking key areas to ensure a quick resolution. In the Liuyang area, since the recovery by Chen Guangzhong's division, they are now searching and suppressing areas near Lianhu and Dongmen City. Army Commander Liu Jianxu also plans to implement concrete post-disaster measures step by step. At the same time, given that Pingjiang and Liuyang counties are connected to Xiushui and Wanzai in Jiangxi Province, and Chongyang and Tongshan in Hubei Province, and are intertwined with Changli and Baxiang, with overlapping mountain ranges, making suppression difficult, I plan to select a suitable central location to convene a joint defense conference to coordinate efforts and achieve a combined attack. In western Hunan, since Commander Li Xue led his troops, together with Zhang Ying's Sichuan army and Dai Huiyuan, Chen Quzhen, and other units, to encircle the area, the bandit He originally intended to flee back to Changtao, but our army, with its soldiers giving their all, launched a surprise attack from Changtao overnight. The bandits then fled from Shimen and Linli towards Jinshi and Fengzhou. Fortunately, our army's swift pursuit led to the successive recovery of Shimen and Linli, and the simultaneous relief of Jinshi and Fengzhou. With no way to advance or retreat, the bandits fled to Zhangjia Factory and Wangjia Factory. We are currently combining efforts with various armies to launch a joint attack, and it will not be difficult to wipe them out in one fell swoop. In addition, in the Huarong area, because Zhang Ying's Sichuan army was transferred to defend the border of Hubei Province and Jianli, the remaining bandits took advantage of the opportunity to infiltrate. Chen Cheng's division and detachments from Li Jue's and Zhang Ying's divisions, along with Liu Peixu's brigade, have surrounded the city from all sides, and the city has been reported to be recovered. This time, I came to Hankou specifically to welcome the Commander-in-Chief to Hunan to oversee the suppression of the remaining bandits, so that the fundamental elimination of the bandit communists and the early realization of political tutelage and construction can be achieved.</p>

<h3 id="e63">National Seal Jade Material Transported from Tianjin to Beijing <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The New Provincial Government Dispatches Guanglu to Escort the Material</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Hetian jade from Xinjiang Province is renowned throughout the world. The imperial seals used by the Qing Dynasty were all sourced from this area. When Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor, the seals he planned to create were also sourced from Hetian. Last year, the National Government planned to create a jade seal and specifically ordered the Xinjiang Provincial Government to send someone to select and deliver the material to Beijing for use. Currently, the jade material has been selected by the New Provincial Government, which has specially dispatched Guanglu, an advisor to the Provincial Government and the current Consul in Zaisang, Soviet Union, to escort the material. Guanglu brought the jade stone via the Siberian Railway through Dong Province and arrived in Tianjin yesterday. He represented Jin Shuren, the Chairman of the province, to meet with Vice Commander Zhang Xueliang to convey his greetings. He will soon depart for Nanjing to present the jade to the National Government. I visited Guanglu at his hotel yesterday, and he showed me the jade, which was tightly wrapped and highly valued. It is irregularly triangular in shape and weighs over thirty catties. One side is yellowish-red, like the seal stones produced in Changhua, while the other side is light ink in color. The bottom reveals white. The entire stone is crystal clear, lustrous, and radiant. A corner reveals several inches of jade, as white and smooth as fat. From this rough stone, one can already see the preciousness it contains. According to Guanglu, the jade was produced in a river in Hetian. An experienced jade worker was able to identify the aura on the water's surface and determine the location of the jade. However, small pieces are easy to find, while large pieces are quite difficult to obtain. The New Provincial Government ordered the Hetian Dao to be responsible for the extraction and construction, which took years to complete. Two pieces were finally obtained. One piece is being transported by camel through the grasslands into the customs, but has not yet arrived. The jade quality is slightly inferior, but it will be used as a backup selection. The jade quality of this piece is extremely fine. After carving, it can yield a huge piece of eight inches square and is entirely clear and free of impurities and patterns. It is truly the highest grade of mutton-fat jade and is suitable for use by the state. Guanglu also elaborated on the various construction projects undertaken in Xinjiang Province in recent years, stating that since Chairman Jin Shuren took office, he has actively developed various undertakings. Most of the province's financial revenue is used for construction, while administrative expenses are kept to a minimum. The province has newly built many automobile roads that extend in all directions, all starting from the provincial capital, Dihua. These include the Digu, Dita, Diyi, Diha, and Dia lines. Digu runs from Dihua to Guchengzi in the east, and Dita runs from Dihua to Tacheng in the northwest, bordering Russia. Both have been opened to traffic. Diyi to Yili, Diha to Haxhi, and Dia to Altay are all under construction and are expected to be open to traffic next year. A provincial road bureau has been established in the provincial capital specifically for this purpose. There are currently over two hundred automobiles traveling back and forth, transporting passengers and goods. The biggest plan at present is to build the Xin-Sui automobile road, which runs from Xinjiang to Suiyuan and connects to the Ping-Sui Railway to transport Northwest local products for sale in the interior. Chairman Jin has been considering this plan for a long time, but it has not been implemented because the route is too long and difficult to survey. A Northwest Scientific Expedition Team that departed from Pingliang by automobile thirteen days ago traveled through Suiyuan to Xinjiang. Upon receiving the team's report, Jin decided to proceed and has sent two automobiles to survey the proposed route to Guihua City, the provincial capital of Suiyuan. He also sent me to Tianjin and Shanghai to order a number of automobiles from foreign merchants for use when the road is opened to traffic. He also plans to contact foreign merchants in Tianjin to order aircraft for communication with the interior and for the transportation of passengers and goods. The postal and telecommunications services in Xinjiang are poorly managed. The provincial government has built a long-wave radio station in Dihua and established a radio school to train radio personnel. I have also been ordered to order several short-wave radio materials to be installed in key areas within the country and the province for communication purposes. The provincial government also operates several yarn factories and ranches, all of which have achieved good results. The self-woven fabrics are now able to compete with foreign goods, and the number of Russian fabrics has gradually decreased. The ranches are researching and improving horse and sheep breeds. Several purebred horses and curly-haired sheep have been purchased from Russia and distributed to the Yili, Dihua, and Barke ranches for improving the breeds of sheep and horses. Purebred horses are the best in the world, and curly-haired sheep produce better wool than western sheep. This type of undertaking is best suited for Xinjiang Province. (December 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Development of Shandong Long-Distance Telephone Service <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Since the establishment of the Long-Distance Telephone Administration by the Department of Construction, the development of long-distance telephone service in this province has been rapidly progressing. To date, service has been opened to more than twenty counties, with operations beginning in over ten counties. Currently, various counties are still actively installing lines. According to Du Desan, the current director of the Administration, the long-distance telephone service in this province was first initiated by Kong Fanhao, the former Director of the Department of Construction, during Chairman Chen (Diaoyuan)'s term. A long-distance telephone training class was established to recruit and teach students in preparation for the installation of lines. By the end of February of this year, a total of 113 students had graduated. Subsequently, when Kong resigned, Chen Luanshu succeeded him as Director of the Department of Construction, but discussions to repair the Lihuo automobile road telephone failed. Until the end of March of this year, the Provincial Government received a telegram from the Central Government ordering the rapid installation of long-distance telephones in the defense area of Ma Hongkui, the General Commander of the 15th Route Army. Consequently, they set out on March 30th and by April 8th, they had installed lines in the five counties of Tai'an, Feicheng, Pingyin, Dong'a, and Dongping. Later, as Chen's former troops were transferred to the Caozhou and Jining areas, the Provincial Government, for the convenience of military affairs, ordered the continued construction of lines in the Cao-Ji area. Thus, they set out on April 17th and by the end of June, they had completed projects in the ten counties of Ruzhang, Ningyang, Jining, Jiaxiang, Juye, Heze, Yuncheng, Jinxiang, Shanxian, and Chengwu. Furthermore, under the order of General Commander Han, they installed a section of line from Zaoyuansi to Qingcheng, and also borrowed telegraph poles to install a section of line from Jinan to Changqing. Later, due to the outbreak of war, the above-mentioned sections of lines were almost completely destroyed. After the recovery of the provincial capital, the Administration dispatched personnel in early September to accompany the transportation battalion of the General Command to install a section of line from Zhoucun to Putai. However, prior to October of this year, the long-distance telephone service in this province was almost completely destroyed, with only one or two sections in operation, failing to form a unified network. In September, I was appointed by the Department of Construction as the concurrently Director of the Long-Distance Telephone Administration and began preparations on the 26th of that month to connect the northeast and southwest lines. On the one hand, I surveyed the condition of the four sections of lines: Ji-Zhang (Jinan-Zhangqiu), Chang-Ping (Changqing-Pingyin), Qing-Xin (Jinan-Xinzhuang), and Zao-Qi (Zaoyuansi-Qidong). On the other hand, I separately prepared budget estimates for the four sections of lines and submitted them to the Department of Construction on October 2nd, requesting that they be submitted to the Provincial Government for discussion. However, due to the delay in receiving funds, the work was delayed until November 9th when the regular expenses for October were finally received. Only then were the four sections of lines expedited, with staff dispatched to start construction and soldiers requested from the transportation battalion of the General Command to assist. The Ji-Xin section, which was fifteen li long, was completed on November 11th. The Ji-Zhang section, which was one hundred and ten li long, was completed on November 23rd. The Chang-Ping section, which was one hundred li long, was completed on November 24th. The Zao-Qi section, which was ninety-five li long, was also completed by the end of November. However, the Ji-Chang section, because it was borrowed from telegraph poles, the Telegraph Bureau has not yet received an order from the Ministry of Transportation, and the poles have not been continuously lent, leading to the route being cut off and requiring a new plan. Although the Zhoucun-Putai line is open, it has not been connected to Jinan. Therefore, it was proposed to the Provincial Government for discussion to continue repairing a section of line between Zhangqiu and Changshan, which has been approved by the Provincial Government and is being prepared for construction. The list of counties connected by each section of line and those currently under construction is listed below: (1) Cao-Ji Area: Jining, Jiaxiang, Juye, Dancheng, Jinxiang, Yutai, Shanxian, and Wucheng have been connected and began operations at the end of November. (2) Tai'an, Feicheng, Pingyin, Changqing, and Dong'a counties. (3) Zaoyuansi, Zhangqiu, Qidong, and Qingcheng counties. (4) Jining to Wenshang: The above three lines have been connected but have not yet begun operations. (5) Between Ningyang, Wenshang, Dongping, and Dong'a. (6) Between Juye and Heze: The above two lines were originally open, but were heavily damaged due to military events this summer and have not yet been repaired. (7) Between Jinan and Changqing. (8) Between Zhangqiu and Changshan: The above two lines are currently under construction. (9) Zhoucun, Changshan, Huantai, Gaoyuan, Boxing, and Putai: Although there are poles and lines, branch offices have not yet been established for organization. (10) Between Jinan and Zhangqiu: Service began on the 1st of this month.</p>

<p>One Communist Party Member Has Been Arrested</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The 29th School in Yanji was previously burned down by communist bandits, and the school principal, Li Houye, his family of three, and Li Houye's uncle and younger brother, Li Hougui, were also burned to death. After this incident occurred, the Yanji County Government immediately dispatched the head of the security team to investigate. According to reports, a private school near the 29th School was previously disbanded by Li Houye, and six students were sent by Li to the 3rd Branch of the Public Security Bureau and held in custody, but were later released. These students harbored a deep hatred for Li, and their whereabouts are currently unknown. It is unclear whether they are related to this case. At the same time, Zhao Yuzhou, the patrol chief of the First District of the County Public Security Bureau, learned that communist bandits were entrenched in the Dadong area of Guchengzi within his jurisdiction. The patrol chief sent two interpreters to conduct a secret investigation. According to reports, there were indeed three communist leaders. The patrol chief then led six police officers to the home of Jin Shouming in the cave and arrested one person, while the other two fled. According to the confession, he is a special commissioner of the Communist Party from eastern Manchuria, named Jin Taihua, also known as Jin Shouting, and many important evidences were seized. He has now been sent to the county for interrogation to determine whether he is related to the burning of the 29th School. The investigation is still underway. (December 8th)</p>

<p>On the 13th, at noon, Zhang Zhijiang, the Pacification Commissioner of Jiangsu and Northern Anhui, hosted over fifty people at the Shuxia Restaurant, including fellow Jiangsu natives in Beijing and members of the Beijing-Shanghai press. During the banquet, Zhang reported that Liang Guanying's troops had arrived at Huaiyin and other places, and a portion had already reached Yangzhou. The remaining two cavalry divisions had also departed from Zhoukou and Caozhou and were heading towards northern Jiangsu. The personnel of the Pacification Headquarters had requested the General Headquarters to order Wei Lihuang's troops to leave Yangzhou for Bengbu, as Wei's troops had not yet left Yangzhou. Once Wei's troops depart, the personnel of the Pacification Headquarters and I will go to Yangzhou to work in the coming days. The pacification plan has already been drafted and will be implemented in sections to eliminate bandits. However, the elimination of bandits cannot rely solely on killing; a permanent solution must be sought. I hope that fellow Jiangsu natives will unite to form a self-defense and self-governance movement, so that the people can live well and the bandits will be eliminated without suppression. Subsequently, Zhu Wenzhong reported on the progress of the Jiangsu Pacification and Post-Disaster Relief Association initiated by Wu Zhihui and others, hoping that fellow Jiangsu natives would actively join. Finally, Niu Yongjian and Zhang Yiou gave speeches, and the gathering ended in joy around 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Tianjin-Pukou Railway to Improve 1st and 2nd Class Passenger Trains <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Three Cars Added for Military Personnel on Official Duty</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, many vehicles on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway have been lost. Of all the passenger trains in operation, only the Ping-Pu train and the Beijing-Liaoning through train are able to operate on time and regularly, and the vehicles are also in good order. The remaining special express trains, such as the 1st and 2nd class trains, are assembled from various sources and are often occupied by military personnel. Although the director of the railway has tried his best to rectify the situation, it is impossible to do so until the end of the war. Now that the war has ended, the number of wounded soldiers and military personnel traveling back and forth on official duty has not decreased, and travelers who buy tickets have no place to stand. In order to protect the passengers, Director Sun of the railway has strictly ordered the Traffic Department to add three cars for military personnel on official duty to the 1st and 2nd class trains. In the future, military personnel will not be allowed to sit in passenger cars. He has also strictly ordered the police sections along the line to cooperate with the military police accompanying the trains to effectively crack down on violations. It is said that this will be implemented starting today. China National Aviation Corporation.</p>

<p>Both Pilots and Two Passengers Are Safe</p>
<p>Yesterday (12th) at 1:00 PM, the China National Aviation Corporation's Chongqing plane, flying from Hankou to Shanghai, experienced a carburetor malfunction over Longtan, and gasoline leaked out. It then landed on the riverbank. A British warship passing by saw the plane drifting on the river and stopped to inquire, then turned around and towed the plane back to the town. It passed the Zhenjiang customs patrol boat Zhenping on the 12th, who took over the towing to Zhenjiang. It was already 3:00 PM. The plane was docked behind another British warship stationed in Zhenjiang. Upon hearing the news, I went to inspect the plane. It was a biplane amphibious aircraft. The two wings and rudder were yellow, and the fuselage was dark gray-black. The cockpit could accommodate two people, and the passenger cabin behind could accommodate six. The words "Chongqing" were written on the back of the plane, with an eagle symbol in front of the words. The plane door was tightly closed, and no one was visible. I also went to the post office to investigate and learned that the mail carried by the plane had been transferred to the Beijing-Shanghai special express train to Shanghai. At 10:00 PM, I learned that the Chinese pilot, Mr. Zhou Junhuang, was staying at the Dahua Hotel, so I went to visit him and had a brief conversation with him: (Question) Where did the plane land? (Answer) Near Longtan. (Question) Did you encounter wind? (Answer) No, there was damage to the engine. (Question) Where was the damage?

<h3 id="e70">Wuhu Urgent News <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce, regarding year-end accounting matters, specially convened an emergency meeting at 2:00 PM today. A resolution was made to telegraph the Anhui Provincial Government, stating that the Provincial Education Department had already approved the extension of the winter vacation for schools in the province, continuing from January 26th for four weeks. It would be extremely difficult for the business community to complete year-end accounting within a limited time frame. Investigations revealed that wholesale stores in Wuhu had extended credit to the hinterland totaling seven or eight million yuan.

<p>A large group of refugees expelled from the territory. Yesterday, a large group of refugees from Henan passed through the county. Subsequently, someone reported to the county government that a large group of refugees had robbed Xianyang of 2,000 yuan in cash and several dan of white rice at the residence of the Zhuxing family in Jiangjiagang. Upon receiving the report, the county government immediately dispatched the Water Patrol Captain to pursue them, chasing them all the way to Kunshan County before intercepting them. There were a total of ten large boats with over two hundred people. They were ordered to return to Qingpu, where police were dispatched to search each person one by one. As a result, no stolen goods were found. The patrol then escorted them overnight to Guanwang Temple Kou, where they were expelled from the territory.</p>

<p>Gang members gathered to order two Hua injured. A certain detective from the Anyang Public Security Bureau gathered gang members in the Yangwang Temple on the night of the 12th to set up a gambling den. According to reports, Kong, the commander of the guard troops stationed in Xianghulu, was deeply concerned that gathering a crowd at night would disrupt public order. He immediately led his troops to arrest them and informed the Public Security Bureau's Second District Defense Team to assist. However, the Yangwang Temple is located in the northeast of Hezhen, surrounded by farmland on all four sides. The conscript troops guarded the entrance, and the gang members only tried to break through the door. The conscript troops opened fire to stop them. During the commotion, A'gen, who ran a shop, and A'qiu, a tailor, were shot down. More than thirty people were arrested and taken to the company headquarters for interrogation. The detective hid in the altar and was not caught. By the time the public security police and the defense team arrived, the crowd had dispersed. Upon receiving the report, the county government sent a team led by Chapter Yi-Zhi, a judge, to conduct an on-site investigation on the morning of the 13th.</p>

<p>Inspector Yang captures kidnappers. Yang Shijie, an inspector from the Public Security Bureau, captured Meng Zhongping, Fan A-Liu, Lu Jintu, and three other kidnappers who kidnapped Mr. Shen from Qitangtou, Qingpu, and a young boy surnamed Mou from Xinzhen North. They were escorted to the office for interrogation today. Mr. Shen's ransom was 800 yuan, and the ransom for the young boy surnamed Mou was 700 yuan. This was admitted without hesitation. They are now sentenced to detention pending a consultation from the Qingpu County Government to handle the case according to the law.</p>
<p>The front pavilion of the county is not allowed to be reduced. The county government demolished the screen wall in front of the county government to rebuild the high bridge in front of the county government. The county government meeting decided to build a pavilion on the original site of the screen wall and handed it over to the construction bureau for design and construction by a district office. Now that the project has been completed, it was set up a few days ago. However, because the style of the pavilion is tall and large, pedestrians and vehicles in the street must detour. Local people think that the pavilions have never been so tall and that they are very lacking in elegance in the middle of the street. Moreover, it is rare to see such a tall building outside Shanghai Road. The Second District Fire Brigade also sent a letter to request that the scope be reduced and rebuilt, because it would hinder the operation of the fire engine and is related to fire protection. The people also sent a letter to the county requesting that it be changed to a smaller size. The county government held the eighty-seventh county government meeting yesterday to discuss the submission. The meeting decided that the construction pavilion in front of the county government had been discussed and decided three times by this meeting and ordered the first district office to follow suit. At present, it is planned to order the district to fill the sides of the Aiming Bridge to the north immediately, and the utility poles will also be moved to the front of the government. It is also ordered that the Public Security Bureau order the relocation so that it does not hinder fire protection and traffic. The county government's record letter will be sent to the Second District Fire Brigade for reference, so this tall pavilion will probably remain in the middle of the road forever and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>The Education Bureau seeks to offset overdue fines. After the county Education Bureau reported the overdue fines to the province, the Education Bureau planned to offset the funds with any relevant money so as to expand the sources of income. It had already proposed collecting donations for flowers and rice throughout the county, new business tax surcharges, and registration fee surcharges, and submitted them to the county government meeting for discussion. It is heard that the discussion result was that the matter concerned small taxes and the decision was made to first hand it over to the Finance Bureau for review before proceeding. The district police rice subsidy will still be maintained. The salaries and allowances of the district chiefs and police officers in this county are not high. When the summer and autumn rice prices are high, life is even more difficult. They have requested an increase in salary. The county government meeting discussed the matter, thinking that the request was indeed true and that the rice subsidy should be appropriately increased and implemented. Now, the twelfth district office has reported that the rice price has dropped and requested that the rice subsidy for the first branch bureau chief be cancelled. However, it is heard that the county government believes that the rice subsidy for the district chiefs and police officers is only 8.5 yuan per month for each first, second, and third class police officer. At a time when the level of living is increasing day by day, the rice subsidy is a general matter and should not be cancelled. The district is ordered to follow the previous order.</p>

<p>Crackdown on refugees staying within the borders. Magistrate Huang previously drafted crackdown measures because refugees often stayed within the borders of the four prefectures of Jiangnan, Suzhou, Songjiang, Changzhou, and Taicang, harming the towns. Subsequently, whenever refugees arrived, the town chiefs, etc., would report to the district office, which would work with the water and land police to escort them back to their hometowns. If resistance or robbery occurred, the ringleaders would be detained and dealt with according to the law. The same measures were forwarded to the counties of Songjiang, Changzhou, and Taicang for implementation, and a request was submitted to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval. The Department of Civil Affairs approved it yesterday (the 13th) and ordered a reply to be faithfully implemented in conjunction with the water and land police.</p>
<p>The National Goods Exhibition will be postponed. The Suzhou National Goods Relief Association and the Shanghai National Goods Maintenance Association jointly launched a mobile exhibition of national goods in Suzhou. It was originally scheduled to be held in December. The General Chamber of Commerce had repeatedly invited both parties to discuss the implementation. However, due to obstacles in the tax-free transportation bill of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, it is heard that it will be postponed to February or March of next year.</p>
<p>Gang bandits linger in Damiao Port, Wujiang. Jin Hao-Ru, the district chief of the tenth district of Wujiang County, reported that gang bandits had recently been found lingering in Damiao Port and other places. He specially submitted a request to County Magistrate Wu of Wu County yesterday to forward a letter to the Third District of the Water Public Security to immediately order its subordinates to assist in suppressing the bandits. Upon receiving the letter, District Chief Shen immediately ordered Captain Xu of the Fourteenth Team and Captain Fang of the Guerrilla Team to go to various roads to assist in the suppression.</p>
<p>The Water Police Squad Leader is being held under surveillance. The First Squad, Eleventh Team of the Third District of the Water Public Security, stationed in Huangdai Town, arrested a petty thief named Zeng A-Lin in the town and escorted him for legal proceedings. However, due to negligent surveillance, Zeng took the opportunity to escape. Subsequently, the local court believed that the criminal was a habitual thief and had been sentenced to imprisonment. He had been released not long ago and was now committing theft again. It was necessary to file a case for investigation and immediately inform Shen, the district chief of the Third District of the Water Public Security. Shen approved the letter, stating that Zeng's escape was clearly due to the negligence of Yu Hong-Xun, the squad leader. He ordered Pei Xuan, the captain of the Eleventh Ma Team, to first place the squad leader under surveillance. Once the fugitive Zeng was captured, he would issue further instructions. Yesterday (the 13th), Huang, the district chief of Huangdai Town, Gu Kun, and local gentry Qian Jieyi, etc., specially submitted a request to the Third District of the Water Public Security, requesting that the squad be released to ensure local governance. It is not known whether the request will be approved.</p>

<p>The whistleblower in the land tax fraud case continues to report. Zheng Cheng-Yuan, the former Yang County Magistrate, and Pan Bin, the Director of the Finance Bureau, were arrested one after another in the land tax fraud case. Fourteen people have been arrested and detained so far. On the eighth day of the previous month, the provincial government transferred them to the District Court Prosecutor's Office, which has been over a month. After repeated trials, the truth of the case has become clear. The day before yesterday, Prosecutor Yan Chang also issued sixty interrogation summonses, all of which were forwarded by the Liyang County Government's judicial office. The court hearing will be held next week. Most of the people summoned are whistleblowers, and some were originally whistleblowers but remained silent after receiving compensation, and then became greedy and continued to report under assumed names. Once the truth is investigated, it will not be difficult to find out the truth.</p>
<p>A suspect in a robbery and kidnapping case commits suicide out of fear of punishment. Qian Tianxiong, the captain of the water patrol team of the county police brigade, reported that Ding A-Sheng, Zhu Shi-Lin, Xu Shi-Rong, and three other suspects who kidnapped Feng Yueshan, a fifteen-year-old boy from Feng Yun-Sheng's family, the deputy village head of Xiaofengcang, north of Fu'an Oujian Bridge, were hiding between Zhangshe and Hujun. On the tenth, he led the police to arrest them at the address. After interrogation by the angular team, Feng Jin-Rong was also arrested. It is heard that he is Feng Yun-Sheng's nephew. According to the interrogation, he confessed that he had overheard Ding A-Sheng discussing the kidnapping of Feng Yun-Sheng's family in a teahouse two months ago and that he had initiated it. Since the two suspects, Xu Bao-Rong and Zhu Bao-Lin, were not related to this case and were actually accomplices in the robbery of the Aoyama Zhijing Nunnery, they were first reported and transferred to the police brigade and then to the county government for interrogation. Ding A-Sheng and Feng Jin-Rong, the two bandits who kidnapped Feng Yue-Quan, were also interrogated again yesterday by Chief Wang. Unexpectedly, the bandit suddenly overturned his previous confession. When ordered to confront Zhang Rongfa, he lowered his head in silence. After the interrogation, Ding A-Sheng was still detained in the water patrol team's headquarters, while Feng Jin-Rong was detained in the Yanshou Temple Hall. Unexpectedly, on the same day, the criminal Ding took the opportunity to wrap the iron wire in the room around his neck and pull it tightly, damaging his throat and killing him on the spot.</p>
<p>Urgent collection of silver and rice like a raging fire. The County Finance Bureau stated that the collection of silver and money for the latter half of the year had been going on for a long time, but the amount completed was still very small. Yesterday, it sent a strict order to the collection officials to pursue the collection by the deadline. If there is any shortage, it will be deemed that the collection is not strong enough and severe punishment will be imposed. At the same time, letters were sent to the district chiefs, asking them to quickly transfer the order to the villages and ensure that the silver due for the latter half of the year is collected and paid in full before December 20th.</p>

Zhou Xiao-Sheng, a resident of Zhoujiawan Village, Wenlinmen Township, Thirteenth District, Jiangyin, is a small property owner. One day, he learned that Wang Lun-Sheng, a member of the village defense team, had been communicating with bandits for two months. Wang Lun-Sheng and Qian Sheng had conspired to rob Zhou Xiao-Sheng's family. Zhou Xiao-Sheng immediately reported to the Wenlinmen Village Defense Team, which arrested Wang Lun-Sheng, Qian Sheng, and Bao A-Gao. According to Bao A-Gao, Qian Sheng had instructed him several times to lead him to rob and gave him thirty yuan each time. Now, he is willing to testify. On the eleventh, Qian Sheng and Bao A-Gao were escorted to the county government. Deputy Commander Wang Lun-Sheng will be interrogated after instructor Xu is released from the county jail. Zhou Xiao-Sheng will also be interrogated to uncover all the details.</p>
<p>The case of Miao Wen-Cai's suicide is scheduled to be closed. Miao Wen-Cai, a graduate of the police academy, was appointed as the acting director of the Fifth Branch Bureau of the Jiangyin Public Security Bureau in September. He committed suicide the day after the incident on the fifth. Wang Da-Sui, the principal of the school, sent Ma Yi-Yong to Cheng to investigate. Since there were various doubts about the suicide, a lawsuit was filed by the judiciary. No clues have been found so far. Ma Yi-Yong recently submitted a petition to the High Court stating that the county magistrate of the county is in a position to conduct investigations. Such suspicious cases of human life should be investigated according to the law. However, the county magistrate did not personally inspect the scene beforehand, and after the incident, he had to file a report from Yi-Yong before he temporarily arrested the suspect, Fu Xue-Nian and Quan Shou-Fu, for further investigation. During the investigation period, except for necessary circumstances, it should not exceed two months according to the law, but the case has lasted for almost three months and there has been no news of the truth. Such a delay will not only make it difficult to redress the wronged, but also have a great impact on the future of the judiciary, etc. The county government has scheduled to subpoena friends and others to court for interrogation on the eighteenth.</p>

<p>The business registration fee will be temporarily postponed. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance stated that the province previously planned to collect business tax registration fees for the police due to the police. The regulations and forms have been issued and the collection director has been dispatched to various counties to investigate and open the office. Now, the Fourth Plenary Session decided to implement the abolition of the tax in January of the 20th year. Since the central government has determined and announced the date of tax abolition, the province's original plan to prepare for the business tax should be changed accordingly. Therefore, a proposal was drafted to postpone the collection of the original business registration fee. The county bureaus were ordered to supervise the directors to comply with the aforementioned forms and actively investigate, register, and create a register, and visit and record the points that should be noted below: (1) In the investigation of the commercial declaration form, the annual business volume and monthly rent of each business household and the number of employees should be added for reference. (2) After the declaration form is filled out by each business and sent to the county bureau, the county bureau will send personnel to review it to avoid omissions. The exact amount should be checked especially for the capital amount. (3) All businesses that should be investigated will only be charged a registration certificate fee of two yuan, and all other fees will be postponed. (4) The magnetic card should be made slowly, if it has been made, it will be retained for changing the business tax. All commercial towns and villages will be investigated and registered. When the central government implements the tax abolition, they will start to change the business tax. The business regulations will be announced separately after being submitted for approval.</p>

<p>The district chief is dismissed for leaving his post without permission. Wang Cheng, the district chief of the third district of Xiaoshan, resigned to the county government several times due to difficulty in raising funds. He then reported that he had taken another job and left his post without permission before receiving the county magistrate's approval. The county government forwarded the report to the Department of Civil Affairs. The Department of Civil Affairs ordered that students of self-government schools have a service obligation.

He should be expelled from school and all the official's books, clothing, accommodation, and other expenses should be pursued and recovered in full as listed.</p>

Zhang Quanxin and others, who are agricultural association officers from Xizhou Village, Dalu Zhang, First District of Xiaoshan, are charged by the Farmer's Association with collecting 0.35 yuan per mu in donations, which many farmers are unwilling to pay. The county agricultural association has checked and confirmed that it is true and requested the county to order the police to handle the matter.

<p>Refugees collude with gang members to rob. Five or sixty Hunan refugees arrived at Aozhao Chen, a place on the border between Xiaoshan and Zhuji on the tenth and robbed Wu and Li families in the area, taking away clothes and ornaments worth more than a hundred gold. They stayed overnight in lonely temples and pavilions, acting like bandits. Recently, it is winter defense time. The refugees stay in the countryside and force people to give them things, which is a real problem for the local area.</p>
<p>The county magistrate limited the time to urge the reporting of land fees. When the villages in Xiaoshan handled the land reporting last year, the seven-tenths reporting fees that had to be sent to the province and county had been used up by the village heads. Therefore, they had to repeatedly start solving the problem. Some cunning village heads used up the reporting fees and then borrowed silver dollars from local gentry and wealthy families to pay for the expenses of the survey personnel. Therefore, some villages had a deficit of more than 700 yuan, and the local people complained a lot. Now that the village chiefs are being elected, they are willing to leave their posts, but they have no choice but to avoid paying the various funds that should be paid to the province and county. Yesterday, the county government specially ordered that they be paid within ten days. Whether it can be cleared is also a problem.</p>

<p>Sir, in the local section of your newspaper on the 9th of this month, there was a news item about a water police officer shooting a opium robbery case. It stated that Yang Bingsheng, an officer of our district, reported to the High Court that Zhu Youlin had robbed opium worth 36 yuan and embezzled tens of thousands of yuan, and that Chief Mao had released him in exchange for 10,000 yuan. This is completely inconsistent with the facts. It was heard in late June of this year that someone wearing a water police uniform had robbed a large amount of opium in Wangxiang. At that time, Zhu Youlin, the former second squad leader of the sixth team in our district, was dismissed from his position due to the case. He was ordered to strictly investigate the sixth team. Later, according to Qian A'gen and Yao Renfu, two people involved in the case, on April 24th, they seized more than 400 packages of opium from A'gen's boat on a pig boat outside Changshu City. Later, Zhu Youlin transferred the goods to another boat and transported them to the south bridge of Dangkou. Yao Renfu was entrusted by Zhu Youlin to sell the goods to A'tu and the old woman, etc. Because the case was serious, our district immediately approved the Ministry of Civil Affairs to order Zhu Youlin and Xiao Mingqi to be arrested and bring them to justice. The arrested criminals were sent to the Wuxi County Government for interrogation and judgment according to the law. Therefore, the case was reported by the chief of our district, the chief of our district broke the case, and our chief of the district approved the Ministry of Civil Affairs to arrest the main criminals and send the arrested criminals to the county for legal proceedings. The facts are there and cannot be concealed. What is the basis for saying that he was released in exchange for a bribe? If you can point out concrete evidence, then I will not shirk my responsibility. If it is a false accusation, then I will investigate and find out the truth. As for the plaintiff Yang Bingsheng, our district has searched the register and there is no such person. It can be inferred that if there is indeed a Yang Bingsheng who filed a complaint with the High Court, then it will not be difficult to find out the truth when he is subpoenaed according to the law. I hereby publish this statement and ask you to publish it in the letter column. Mao Mujun, Chief of the Second District of Jiangsu Water Police, December 12th.</p>

After arriving in Beijing on the 9th, Wang immediately went to the Ministry of Education to meet with Vice Minister Liu Dabai, reporting on the handover of supervisory duties to the newly appointed Liu Suichang. Wang mentioned that the Ministry of Education had approved the allocation of 10,000 yuan in national currency from the Chong fund as travel expenses for students from Hunan and Guangxi provinces. He had previously submitted a request to Minister Jiang and Division Chief Sun, requesting the same treatment for government-funded students, which had been approved. Therefore, he had provided the same subsidies to government-funded students. Vice Minister Liu stated that although Wang had made this request previously, it had not been officially approved. The so-called "already approved" was clearly a misunderstanding. Wang also went to the Ministry of Education yesterday to explain the allocation of these funds, stating that he would take responsibility and compensate for any errors. Yesterday, the Ministry of Education issued an order to the new Supervisor of Students Studying in Japan, Liu Suichang, ordering him to investigate Wang's handover situation. The original order stated: "After reviewing the report that former Supervisor Wang's accounts were unclear and had been rejected by the Ministry, when the Ministry approved the resignation of the former Supervisor, it repeatedly ordered that he not be allowed to return to the country until the handover was clear, and instructed the Supervisor to verify each item against the case files. All items not approved for write-off by the Ministry should be calculated clearly before acceptance. Later, based on a telegram stating that the procedures had not been completed, the telegram replied that acceptance was not allowed. Now, after reading various newspapers such as Shen Xin Shi Shi on the 9th of this month, which contained the Supervisor's remarks after returning to the country, and according to reports from Ministry staff that the former Supervisor had indeed left his post and returned to the country, while the Ministry had not received any report from the Supervisor or former Supervisor Wang regarding the handover, and according to a telegram from the manager of students studying in Japan stating that Wang Keren was engaged in even worse embezzlement and corruption than Jiang, and had returned to the country without a clear handover, it is requested that he be detained and dealt with according to the law. Ascertain whether former Supervisor Wang has completed the handover clearly and whether the Supervisor has formally accepted it, and report in detail." This order is issued to this city.</p>

This was a true depiction of the meeting between Jinan and Jiaotong Universities in Zhenru Town yesterday, and no less grand than the encounter between Nanyang and St. John's on Mackenzie Road in the past. When the whistle blew, the great battle began. The superior defeated the inferior, and the strong defeated the weak. When the ninety minutes were up, the score was settled.

<h3 id="e94">Jinan Triumphs in Jiangnan for the Third Time <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Jinan Football Team has won the Jiangnan Football Championship for two consecutive years. Since the start of this year's competition, they have defeated Guanghua, overcome Zhonggong, and defeated Fudan. Yesterday, they also won decisively against Jiaotong. Thus, the championship of Jiangnan has been held by Jinan for the third time. Jiaotong came in second. The results of each school this year are as follows: School Name | Matches Played | Wins | Losses | Draws | Goals For | Goals Against | Points Jinan | 4 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 32 | 2 | 8 Jiaotong | 4 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 9 | 11 | 5 Guanghua | 4 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 6 | 8 | 4 Fudan | 4 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 16 | 3 Zhonggong | 4 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 3 | 17 | 0 (1) Each Has Their Own Skills in Art: Goalkeepers: The circumstances and hardships of the goalkeepers of both teams were different. Jiaotong's Li Chuanxin was physically strong and had a firm will. Only two of the nine goals conceded could be blamed on him. The rest were the result of shots taken within five steps, beyond his ability to stop. Li's weakness was a lack of agility in turning and a lack of speed in his hands. Liang Guanlian, who guarded Jinan's goal, was as steady as Mount Tai and had no opportunity to display his talents. The defense was as solid as a city of gold and iron, and even flying birds could not cross it. He encountered two major dangers in his life, but almost ruined things because of complacency in a safe situation, showing off his skills, which was not appreciated by the wise. Jinan and Jiaotong Full Team Members (Photo by Ye Changlie) Inside Line: Jinan's inside line was extremely reliable. Their feet were firm and their positioning was appropriate. Jiang was known for his courage and Feng for his skill. The enemy had no way to sneak through. In the second half, the inside line often stayed in the opponent's area, using defense as a pretext for attack. Whenever the opponent gained momentum and counterattacked, the two were always able to turn around and deal with the situation with ease. Jiaotong's Wang and Chen also had good defensive skills. Wang was especially known for his composure, but under strong pressure from the opponent, he was ultimately unable to cope. His weakness was that he often hesitated to move forward, allowing the enemy to penetrate deep. Center Line: Jiaotong's major defeat was due to the center line. Individually, center back Yang Xinghua was able to loyally fulfill his duties, rushing out to obstruct the attack, but left and right Cheng and Shen did not move properly, leaving many gaps. The entire line was unable to follow the forwards to provide assistance, so the five forwards often failed halfway. In comparison, Jinan was completely different. Zhuang Shihong was the center back, supported by Lin Songfa and Liang Shutang. The three moved quickly and were able to attack and defend equally. The momentum of the forwards was thus greater, and the defense was more solid. It was difficult to distinguish the skills of the three. After Zhuang was injured and left the field, Liang took over Zhuang's position and Yang Baomiao took over Liang's position. After Liang's position changed, he was still impressive. Forward Line: Jinan was superior in terms of order and strength, but Jiaotong was also nimble and skillful. Fei Fuxu made several dangerous attempts, and Liu Ximeng took the lead and was very active. The left and right inside forwards contributed a lot by advancing and retreating according to the situation, but the right wing's performance was disappointing. In the first twenty minutes, they marched boldly to the distant front, but when the center defenders Li Xinchuan saved a ball (photo by this newspaper), the weak points of the line were exposed, and they did not attack much. It is said that the entire line was stationed in the territory, making a final effort seven minutes before the end. They rushed out like swift horses and pounced on the enemy's goal, but were offside and ineffective. Even though it was ineffective, it was still a pleasure to smell the meat even though they did not eat it. Jinan's five forwards were like dragons and tigers, and their imposing manner was intimidating. Wherever they went, the enemy was defeated. Their excellent cooperation and accurate shooting were amazing. Although the nine goals were due to the kicks, the assistance of their teammates could not be ignored. Dai scored four goals, Chen Zhenhe and Fu Hexuan scored two goals each, and Luo Haiguang scored one goal. Only Mei Hongbao and Tong Rongwen did not score. Jinan Lineup: Yang Baosen (below), Chen Zhenhe; Feng Yunyou, Liang Shutang (above), Fu Hexuan; Liang Guanlian, Liang Shutang (below), Dai Linjing; Zhuang Shihong (above), Tong Rongwen; Jiang Shanjing, Lin Songfa, Luo Haiguang; Mei Hongbao Jiaotong Lineup: Fei Fuxu; Chen Gongyu, Cheng Shaomo, Wan Mian; Li Chuanxin, Yang Xinghua, Liu Ximeng; Wang Gongchen, Shen Guanlan, Zhang Jinrong; Xue Wenyong (2) Discussing the Battle Situation Reveals Strengths and Weaknesses: Three Probes into Enemy Territory: At half past two, they chose a place to deploy their formations. Jinan and Jiaotong faced each other north and south. When the silver whistle blew, the fierce battle began. Jinan led the attack, advancing repeatedly, and then won a free kick at twenty yards. Zhuang Shihong shot directly at the goal, but the goalkeeper punched it out. Fu Hexuan followed up with a shot, but the goalkeeper hit it away again. Mei Hongbao took advantage of the situation and took it, but the goalkeeper caught it. Jinan's three probes into the goal failed. Half Joy, Half Sorrow: Jiaotong's army suddenly became powerful, and the forwards advanced in a circle, making a lot of noise and causing consternation. Soon, a corner kick was forced, but it was ineffective, and the ball reversed direction again. Yang, the center defender, fouled in the center area. Jinan's five forwards followed the ball, and Mei Hongbao took it to the center. Fu Hexuan greeted it and entered the goal. This was Jinan's first goal. The students in the audience were overjoyed. It was only eight minutes. Almost Ruined: Jinan was strong, and Dai's center forward shot high and low, all of which fell into the hands of the goalkeeper. Suddenly, Jiaotong's center back Yang kicked a free kick and shot high, and Jinan's goalkeeper Liang punched it up, almost ruining things. Jinan returned to the attack again and hit the goalpost. Mei Hongbao was injured and exited. Luo Haiguang entered the field. Jiaotong brought thousands of troops and horses to Jinan's goal. Gao Mian shot high, and the goalkeeper jumped up to capture it, succeeding and failing, fortunately being saved. Five Blessings Come to the Door: Jiang Shanjing shot a long shot, and Tong immediately crossed the ball. Dai put it into the net within five steps, scoring the second goal. For the third goal, Chen Zhenhe, from the left wing in the midst of the encirclement of Jinan, hit the ball and Dai scored the fourth goal. Fu scored the fifth goal and Chen Zhenhe scored the sixth goal from the corner. From the loss of the second goal to the sixth goal was like a flash of lightning. The Five Blessings Came to the Door. Train Full of Fans (Ye Changlie) Jinan Sincere Fortune Child: Jinan scored a total of six goals in the first half, and Jiaotong's goal was empty. Several Attacks Were Unsuccessful: Not long after the restart, Dai, the center forward, scored another goal. The Jiaotong players cheered and were energized. Liu, the center forward, led the crowd and entered the goal alone. One ball was passed to the left, Fei, the left winger, returned the ball, but the two generals on the right were not fast enough and missed the opportunity. Jiaotong invaded again, but the center defense line did not provide support and failed. Jiaotong's first advance was solely defended by Feng Yunyou. Jiaotong failed again. Last Struggle: The Jinan army oppressed the territory and raged unchecked. The Jiaotong goal became the target of the public's failure. Within ten minutes, Dai and Luo each scored a goal. Dai's goal was due to Chen Zhenhe's pass, while Luo's was due to the cooperation of the left side, and he sat back and reaped the rewards. At that time, Jinan had a 9-0 victory. The students were happy. Unexpectedly, Jiaotong's last struggle caused Jinan's goal to be lost. The ball was passed from the left wing Fei, Zhang Jinrong passed it to Wan Mian, and Wan Mian was anxious and rushed to the goal first. Although he saw a shot on the goal, it was offside and invalid. The Jinan army came again and came again, but the time had come, and the referee sounded the horn to end the game. Otherwise, Dai would have grown up again. The result of the game was Jinan's 9 goals to Jiaotong's 0. The referee was Ke Chunhui, the side referees were Li Silian and Chen Pu. (3) Speaking of Gossip: Thousands of Things: Before the gossip, we must first praise the Jinan's male and female scouts. It is not easy to maintain order with more than 10,000 spectators and achieve a complete start and finish. When the bandits were stupid, they guarded the inside and surroundings of the venue with great care. It is appropriate to say that their hard work and merits are high. Cars Like Roaming Dragons: On the Zhenru Road, the cars of the spectators were like roaming dragons, end to end in a winding line. Private cars, hired cars, moving cars, mixed goods cars, yellow, blue, green, black, and so on, were all there. There were also postal workers who made a special trip to watch on green bicycles, special cars from the railway bureau, and two-legged cars running back and forth. Good Luck: Of course, the Jinan team, which won the championship, had good luck, and the small vendors and fruit stalls nearby all tripled their profits. The car dealers and the Huning Railway Bureau were even more happy. Puzzling: A line of cars was traveling on Zhenru Road, and the Jiangbei people in the small shops and thatched sheds on the side of the road were all standing and watching blankly, puzzled. They must have thought that there was a play being performed in Zhenru. A New Poem: The Jinan gate hangs with the four characters "Welcome Jiaotong". Inside are countless slogans and couplets. There is a poetic one that is very good, and it is recorded here: "Hello friends, good morning sir! Today the west wind is not tight, the warm air is abundant. Here, the joy is soaring. The shout is loud, the fists are big, the shoulders are thick. Even if his brothers are many, you kick him, he will trip. Let his mother go away! Everyone is fighting to say Jiaotong is good, Jinan's ball skills are even more amazing. Run fast, kick steady, bronze head and iron bones show heroism. We must win every battle and overcome every attack, and the Jiangnan is famous. Who doesn't know that our university team is the strongest, and we can't find it all over the country? Don't you see that Jinan won the championship last year? And this year, the championship is also Jinan. Jinan Cheerleading Team (Ms. Chen Ruiping, the school flower, is in the lower left corner, offering flowers on the spot)" (Photo by Ye Changlie) Can't Escape: Jinan also has a very interesting English slogan, which says, "Nanyang friends, you want to come and eat ice cream, but there is no, only to offer a duck egg." Sure enough, Jiaotong lost a big duck egg. The Most Wonderful Couplet: Jinan hung many couplets yesterday, and there were some good ones, such as "One year at a time, take care of the children and work hard" and "Three wins in three years, the championship must still be there". There was also "Overcoming Wusong, controlling Jiangwan, but also pacifying the Great Western Road, it is known that the Xu family is also suppressing Zhenru, and the conquered land" "The five tigers in front are the pillars of the country, and the iron gate behind is locked more firmly. It can be seen that Jiangnan is still Jinan who wins the championship." and "Tiger steps dragon, 南償我願", "Falling flowers and flowing water, 吞寰宇 共称奇" Jiaotong Cheerleading Team Embraces the Jinan School Gate (Changlie) Jiao Sheng Calls: There were many Jinan girls. Yesterday, there were also many girls in the cheerleading team. Whenever a goal was won, the cheering was heard. Ms. Chen Zhongping, the school flower, was in green and cheered very vigorously. School Workers Cheering: The Jiaotong school workers organized a cheering team, which was a new record in the cheerleading team. Yellow Flags: There were 700 Jiaotong supporters, with four special cars. Each person held a small yellow flag. Countless flags were seen fluttering in the wind. When a ball was shot, the small flags flew together, which was a spectacular sight. Opening the Gong and Drum: Both sides were equipped with gong and drum teams. Big gongs, small gongs, cymbals, and leather drums of all kinds were complete. When the whistle blew to start the game, the gongs and drums were loud, and everyone who heard it was nervous. Fire Bell: The fire bell was loud and urgent, which made people feel frightened. Jinan even used it yesterday. Whenever the ball was carried to the Jiaotong gate, the bell rang suddenly and sharply, as if a fire was burning on their eyebrows. It was a good strategy to defeat the enemy. Special Box: The viewers were standing hard, and the journalists alone got the seat. In the second half, the viewers crowded forward, and the journalists could only stand. They could not even stand and see. Next to the venue was Jinan's auditorium, and many people climbed up to the windows, saying that this was a special box.</p>
<p>Word Splitting Mr. : Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock Jinan University held an encouragement meeting, presided over by Mr. Tang Tonghou who is very enthusiastic about the school's sports, saying that yesterday specially came to Shanghai to split two words, and casually picked the two words 交 and 曁, the word splitting Mr. said that the above 交 is six, and the 曁 center is a ○, the score is six to zero, and yesterday the first half of the game was really as Mr. Tang also said that to ask 曁南's fortune, pick the 南 character, he said that as long as you try to lift both feet up, which is to pull the left and right straight of the 南 character flat, this fortune is a very happy character, the top of the 南 character follows from ten, this happiness can be maintained for ten years, and the whole hall laughs. Inn Advertising: The Jinan school was bustling with cars and horses yesterday, and major hotels in this city, such as Yong'an and Shenzhou, all put on special cars to send tourists to 眞茹, with words on the cars, which is nothing more than advertising for the hotels.擺老資格: Jinan's set of slogans, flags and lucky black cat from last year were still on display yesterday, and I heard that they will be like this every year to show the old qualifications. Treating Reporters: After the game, Jinan's Secretary Fan Youshan and Mr. Li Bangdong, Cai Guoping, Liang Guocai, etc. treated all the reporters at the Science Hall, with fragrant tea and snacks. Mr. Fan said that the safe completion of this ball game was gratifying and that this ball game was held in Zhenru, which was enough to arouse the interest of the villagers in sports.</p>

<p>Pacification and Rehabilitation Branch</p>
<p>Discussions on Jiangsu Pacification and Rehabilitation</p>
<p>Since the National Government specially appointed Zhang Zhijiang as the Director of Jiangsu Pacification, it has aroused the attention and expectations of the people of Jiangsu Province. Yesterday, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce specially convened all executive and supervisory committee members to discuss measures for pacification and rehabilitation, and invited Mu Ouchu, Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce, to attend the meeting and report. Attendees included Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Wu Zhihao, Lu Qisheng, Xu Jilu, Fang Jiaobo, Lu Fengzhu, Ma Jiliang, Ye Huijun, Luo Qinghua, Chen Songyuan, Yan Esheng, Zheng Chengqing, etc. After Chairman Wang Xiaolai respectfully read the will, Vice Minister Mu reported, stating that he was attending today as a citizen of Jiangsu to report on the issue of Jiangsu pacification. The people of Su Province have suffered from banditry for a long time. After this military stabilization, the government is determined to suppress bandits. The Jiangsu part has specially appointed Zhang Zhijiang as the Pacification Director. Since the announcement of this order, the Jiangsu compatriots in Beijing have appointed Wu Zhihui, Niu Yongjian, Di Ying, Gao Lingbai, Zhu Wenzhong, and others, including himself, as representatives to express their welcome to Director Zhang and express their willingness to cooperate with the government on the part of the people. The negative aspects of pacification and rehabilitation are to organize Qingxiang Baojia, and the positive aspects are: (1) to raise large sums of money to purchase seeds, agricultural tools, and plowing cattle, and distribute them to farmers in the disaster-stricken areas of northern Jiangsu; (2) to request the Farmers Bank and various banks in Shanghai to bring capital and establish farmers' mortgage loan agencies in the disaster-stricken towns of northern Jiangsu so that farmers do not feel exhausted. On the one hand, it is suggested that the provincial government speed up the construction of a ring road along the Taihu Lake, which is beneficial for suppressing bandits and exporting agricultural products. In northern Jiangsu, the construction of Wan Gong Dike can reduce the scourge of bandits. However, road and dike construction is the responsibility of the government, while fundraising, seed distribution, and the establishment of banks rely on the assistance of the business community, because local security is most related to the development of industry and commerce. Now, the wheat in Su Province this year is not enough to be planted. Planting spring wheat should be done in January and February. If preparations are not made now, it may be too late. Nanjing has already planned to establish a Jiangsu Pacification and Rehabilitation Association, and it is hoped that branches will be set up everywhere in the future to achieve effective results. Shanghai is the commercial center, and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has the ability to call on a high level and should also have the willingness to assist in pacification. Therefore, it is highly hoped that the Shanghai branch will be organized by the gentlemen of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and at the same time, efforts should be made to raise donations to purchase seeds and establish banks. If everyone does their best, success will be easy. After detailed discussions by Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, and Wu Zhihao, they unanimously expressed that the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce should do its best to assist the government in handling the pacification of Su Province. As for the organization of a pacification and rehabilitation branch, it should be discussed and convened after the Nanjing side has drafted various rules and regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Water Price Increase Case <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Mediation Begins</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed the office to negotiate</p>
<p>Please advise users to wait quietly for a resolution</p>
<p>The Public Works Department will hold a board meeting tomorrow</p>
<p>Mediation will take place at the British Consulate on the 16th</p>
<p>The dispute over the water company's price increase is becoming increasingly serious. The company is threatening to cut off the water supply, and the public's attitude is becoming increasingly fierce. After receiving a telegram from the Chinese Ratepayers Association in the Concession, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, ordering it to quickly contact the Public Works Department and the British Consul General to handle the matter peacefully. The water company should be quickly ordered to immediately restore the water supply and not to use the high-pressure tactic of cutting off the water supply again, and to persuade users to remain calm and wait for a peaceful resolution. After detailed consultations between Directors Chen Shiguang and Liu Yunfang, it was decided to first consult with the British Consul General, B. G. Tours, and the Chairman of the Public Works Department, McDonald. At 8:00 PM last night, British Counselor Eggland hosted a banquet for the British Far East Economic Survey Group at the Cathay Hotel. The British Consul General and the Chairman of the Public Works Department were present, and Chen and Liu were also invited to attend. The two sides then met and discussed separately. The British Consul General and others agreed to the peaceful proposal and promised to notify the water company to restore the water supply. According to McDonald, the Public Works Department has scheduled a special board meeting for 4:30 PM next Monday (the 15th) to discuss the matter specifically. At the same time, the British Consul General also agreed with Liu Yunfang to convene representatives of the water company at the British Consulate at 10:00 AM on the 16th for a three-party mediation. The various news heard yesterday are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>The Ratepayers Association sends a letter of condolences to the households whose water has been cut off</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ratepayers Association sent letters to Zhang Tiankai, a resident of Kang Nao Road, and the Huashang Villa, whose water supply was cut off by the water company, as follows: (1) Letter to Zhang Tiankai, stating that the association received a report from your representative on the afternoon of December 10 and a letter from you on December 11. The Shanghai Water Company, a British company, disregarding humanitarianism and the principles of public utilities, cut off the water supply to your residence on the 10th of this month in order to achieve the purpose of forcing a price increase. It is shocking to learn that the company's tyrannical behavior dares to act arbitrarily within our country's territory. In addition to telegraphing the government to handle the matter and negotiating with the Public Works Department to fulfill its responsibility to supply water, we hope that you will inform us of the situation at any time. (2) Letter to Huang Chunrong, acting on behalf of the Huashang Villa Company, stating that the association received a letter from you on December 11 reporting that the Shanghai Water Company, a British company, closed the main water supply valves for houses 1051 to 1055, Changchun Lane, Peng Road, in order to force a price increase. This is shocking. The opposition to the water company's price increase is the public opinion of all industries and residents, and the responsibility for paying the water bill is not directly borne by your company. The company's anger at your company, which endangers the lives of all residents, is even more of a shameless act of bullying the weak. The company's disregard for humanitarianism and the destruction of the principles of public utilities is extremely barbaric. Your company's fearlessness in the face of tyranny in order to seek justice is commendable and admirable. In addition to telegraphing the government to handle the matter and negotiating with the Public Works Department to fulfill its responsibility to supply water, we are sending this letter to express our respect and hope that you will take note of it and inform us of the situation at any time.</p>
<p>Research on the issue of replacing water meters</p>
<p>Jones, an official of the Public Works Department, stated yesterday that the only way to break the current impasse of the price increase is for the water company to install water meters, and that the Public Works Department has also agreed to this in principle. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency believes that it is worth studying whether replacing water meters will benefit users. He specially visited Yan Esheng, Executive Committee Member and Secretary of the Chinese Ratepayers Association. According to his statement, the water company has planned to replace water meters for a long time. This matter is very beneficial to the company, but it will definitely increase the burden on ordinary citizens. The direct costs of tap water, excluding indirect costs such as interest rates and depreciation, are an average of 18 cents per 1,000 gallons. The water company charges an average of 23.1 cents per 1,000 gallons for those who pay according to rent and 43.3 cents per 1,000 gallons for those who pay according to water meters. If the company implements a 25% price increase, those who pay according to water meters will pay 54.1 cents per 1,000 gallons. If the company replaces all water meters, ordinary citizens will have to jump from a burden of 23.1 cents per 1,000 gallons to 54.1 cents per 1,000 gallons. What is even more noteworthy is that when water bills are calculated according to rent, they are paid by the landlord. If water meters are replaced, the water bill will be paid by the tenant, just like with electricity. At the same time, landlords will not reduce rent due to the replacement of water meters. From this perspective, not only will ordinary citizens' burden increase from 23.1 cents per 1,000 gallons to 54.1 cents per 1,000 gallons when water meters are replaced, but those who do not bear the water bill will have to bear 54.1 cents per 1,000 gallons in the future. Concession residents account for the majority of the population, so if the company implements the replacement of water meters, the asset class will benefit, while ordinary civilians will suffer. Furthermore, if we compare Chinese and foreign residents, foreigners live in tall Western-style houses with high rents but do not use much water, while Chinese people are the opposite. As a result, foreigners will benefit, while Chinese people will suffer. This issue is very important, and we must give it serious consideration and attention for the sake of ordinary Chinese citizens. According to the water company's calculations, it will cost no more than 2 to 3 million yuan to replace water meters in three years, about 1 million yuan is enough. Jones also said that the company only cut off the water supply to two households because they were three months in arrears, which is also a one-sided statement. The two households are willing to pay the water bill at the old price, but the company refuses to accept it. The company must calculate according to the increased price, but the two households refuse to pay, so the company cut off the water supply. It can be seen that the water supply to the two households was cut off not simply because of arrears, but also because of the price increase issue. Jones said that only these two households have been cut off, and perhaps he thinks that this is still too few. He does not know that if these two households can be cut off, then every household can be cut off, and by extension, the water supply to all concession users can be cut off. This is evidenced by the threatening letters issued by the water company to each household, giving them a deadline to pay or else the water supply will be cut off. Furthermore, imperialists often demanded that the Chinese government cede territory and pay reparations for the killing of one or two missionaries. For example, when Qingdao was forcibly leased, only two missionaries were killed in Shandong. Why didn't they say that only two foreign missionaries were killed? Jones once sent a letter to the Ratepayers Association acknowledging that the water company's cut-off of the water supply was justified. If other incidents occur due to the cut-off of the water supply in the future, Jones should bear full responsibility.</p>
<p>The Real Estate Association held an emergency meeting yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association held an emergency meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday because the water company's cut-off of the water supply is related to the livelihood of millions of residents. All members attended the meeting, and Yan Yanfang was elected as chairman. The chairman reported that the Shanghai Water Company's cut-off of the water supply is a matter of great importance, endangering the lives of residents. The purpose of today's meeting is to ask all members to put forward as many measures as possible so that the association can negotiate. Then, the meeting discussed the agenda items: (1) Send a letter to the Public Works Department ordering the water company to restore the original state and continue to supply water as a prerequisite. The motion was passed. (2) Omitted. (3) Send a letter to the Chinese members of the Public Works Department urging them to strive for the cancellation of the water price increase and the revision of the contract at the special meeting. The motion was passed. (4) The letter will not be drafted today and will be published tomorrow. The motion was passed. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>

<p>Chu Minyi Returns to China</p>
<p>Warm welcome from all walks of life</p>
<p>Chu Minyi, the chief representative of the National Government to the Belgian Centennial Exposition, returned to China yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM on the Japanese mail ship Shunyo Maru, accompanied by his secretary Zhou Shida. Those who went to the Huangpu Wharf to welcome him were extremely enthusiastic. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Grand welcome</p>
<p>First, the preparatory committee for the welcome of Mr. Chu Minyi, the representative of the National Government, was organized by fellow villagers from Huzhou. Later, many more people joined in, about 30 organizations and more than 100 people. The preparatory committee erected a decorated archway at the Huangpu Wharf, with the words "Welcome Mr. Chu Minyi Back to China" written horizontally on it, and a couplet on the side that read, "The name of Bowang remains in the remote areas, and the prosperity of Shen Hao shakes the world." A large gasoline lamp was hung below the horizontal plaque, which was extremely bright and dazzling. Many national flags were also hung, fluttering in the wind. In addition, there were dozens of colored silk flags embroidered with the words "Welcome Mr. Chu Minyi, Representative of the National Government, Back to China," which were particularly pleasing to the eye. In addition, the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Pharmacists Association, Southeast Medical University, the Sino-French National Industrial College, and the Sino-French University Pharmaceutical Training School also had many large white flags and small triangular flags.</p>
<p>Number of welcomers</p>
<p>The organizations that went to the wharf to welcome him included the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Committee, the Bankers Association, the Health Construction Committee, the Medical and Pharmaceutical Review Society, the Shanghai National Martial Arts Hall, the Global Chinese Students Association, the Dahua Hospital, the Shanghai Civilian Hospital, the Labor Hospital, the Chinese Hygiene Society, the Times Youth Society, the Tongde Medical Society, the Chinese National Products Federation, the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Pharmacists Association, the Sino-French National Industrial School, the Pharmaceutical Training School, the Labor University, Southeast Medical University, and the Zhongxing Elementary School. Individuals included Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yiting, Lin Kanghou, Lu Liankui, Shao Ruoxin, Yuan Liangzhou, Jiang Xiahun, Song Wusheng, Nong Ruhui, Tian Shoucheng, Chen Gonglu, Zhang Shewo, and Hui Ning School Jiang Paihua, Xu Huanren, Xu Dechen, and Jiang Zhongxi, and over 2,000 other people. Mr. Chu's father, Xing Tian, who is already 80 years old with white hair and beard, and his wife and daughters also came to the shore to greet him.</p>
<p>Songs and music</p>
<p>As the Shunyo Maru approached the wharf, the military band played military music, and the students of the Central School sang welcome songs, mixed with the sound of waving hats and hands. The torches of the photography company and the sound of the sailors mooring the ship were all presented to the eardrums.</p>
<p>Large film</p>
<p>The Mingxing Film Company brought a motion picture camera with torches to film. Whenever Chu Minyi stood on the ship's edge, crossed the ship, went down to the pier, or shook hands with the welcomers, it was all captured on film. In addition, many reporters and photographers from various newspapers and photo studios went to take pictures. Chu Minyi also carried a camera with him and took pictures along the way.</p>
<p>Representatives board the ship</p>
<p>After the ship was docked, the representatives who came to welcome him originally planned to send ten people to board the ship to welcome him, but as soon as the gangway was arranged, Chu Minyi disembarked. Moreover, because there were too many people, it was not easy to push through the crowd to board the ship, so although representatives were sent, they did not board the ship.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Asks the Executive Yuan for Approval　　Various Industries Again Petition Vice Minister Mu　　The Trade Regulations Issue that the Shanghai Municipal Various Industries Guilds Are Striving For, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce Submits to the Executive Yuan Asking for Approval, Yesterday Various Industries Also Sent Representatives to Petition Vice Minister Mu of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The Situation is Recorded Separately as Follows:</p>
<p>(1) Instructions from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>The Various Industries Safeguarding Trade Regulations Committee Received Yesterday Instruction No. 14438 from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which opened with a telegram stating that the general assembly of representatives from various industries had unanimously resolved on trade regulations and had again telegraphed the ministry to swiftly implement them, requesting review and compliance. This was delegated to the telegram branch. The telegram stated that the trade regulations case had been submitted to the Executive Yuan for consideration of the three measures proposed by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs in the National Industry and Commerce Conference proposal. This was to be acknowledged. It was also heard that Minister Kong recently sent a letter to a certain well-known figure in Shanghai business circles, roughly stating that the trade regulations issue was expected to be approved by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Situation of Petitioning Vice Minister Mu</p>
<p>The Various Industries Guilds, upon hearing the news that Vice Minister Mu Ouchu of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce would attend the Appeasement Conference convened by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, sent representatives to petition Vice Minister Mu. Representatives from more than 160 guilds, including the Chinese Soap Industry, Coal Industry, Timber Industry, Silk Industry, Paint Industry, Sauce Garden Industry, Chinese Woolen Fabric Factory Industry, Transportation Industry, and Medicinal Materials Industry, totaling more than 300 people, including Mao Chunpu, Luo Zheng, Chen Weiwen, and Lu Wenzhu, held petition banners, and the venue was plastered with slogans, creating a tense atmosphere. At around 4:00 PM, Vice Minister Mu Ouchu of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce arrived at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Committee Room. Representatives from various industries publicly elected Luo Qinghua, Ye Jiaxing, Ge Yanqing, and Qiu Liangyu, along with five other representatives, to lead the audience. The representatives requested Vice Minister Mu to report to the representatives of various industries in the hall on the process and purpose of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce rejecting the trade regulations. Mr. Mu stated that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had already been ordered to conclude and that he himself was attending the Appeasement Conference today and could not come out to report to the public. The representatives then vehemently stated the importance of trade regulations, arguing that Vice Minister Mu, being a Shanghai merchant by origin, should provide guarantees for the commercial sector, and that the rejection of trade regulations during Vice Minister Mu's term was regrettable. They hoped for more support in the future and requested his presence to address the representatives of various industries on the rejection process. Vice Minister Mu replied that regardless of his future position, he would ask Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industries and relevant departments to find ways to maintain them and prevent the representatives of various industries from being disappointed. While both sides were at a standstill, Municipal Chamber of Commerce Standing Committee member Wang Yansong was present and said that trade regulations were the lifeblood of merchants, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce should strive for them. Moreover, since Vice Minister Mu had already agreed to forward the request, the representatives could wait quietly for good news. At this point, the representatives then took their leave.</p>
<p>(3) Resolutions on Two Temporary Proposals</p>
<p>After the representatives of various industries completed their petition, Luo Qinghua, one of the five representatives, was elected to report on the situation of petitioning Vice Minister Mu and to resolve on two temporary proposals: (1) Send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward to the Bureau of Social Affairs that all members of the same industry must join the industry guild, and the industry guild must join the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. (2) Telegraph the Executive Yuan to swiftly urge the implementation of the trade regulations of various industries passed by the National Industry and Commerce Conference, regardless of whether members have joined the guild or not, all members of the same industry must abide by the regulations uniformly.</p>
<p>(4) Send a Letter to Minister Kong Asking for Approval</p>
<p>The Safeguarding Trade Regulations Committee organized by the Various Industries Guilds held its seventh committee meeting on the 11th, publicly electing Zheng Chengqing and other representatives to request Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industries to dismiss his intention to resign. It was heard that Minister Kong had reluctantly agreed to take office, and a special letter was sent to express their love and support and to request approval of the trade regulations (abbreviated title). It is said that our association previously heard that the respected director was honorably transferred to the Ministry of Industries and sent a telegram to congratulate him. Then we heard that the respected director had the intention of retiring and immediately telegraphed the National Government on an auspicious day to grant a retention order. At the seventh committee meeting yesterday, Zheng Chengqing, Ye Jiaxing, Sun Choucheng, and other representatives were appointed to approach him and earnestly request him to dismiss his intention to resign, fearing that the matter might be presumptuous, so we specially requested Director Zhao Jinqing to act as an intermediary. Director Zhao informed us that the director had already reluctantly agreed to take office due to the retention of all parties, so it is not appropriate to disturb his peace of mind. We hereby send a letter to express our love and support. Only the trade regulations of various industries are the foundation of the survival of the industry guilds and the key to the rise and fall of the industry. After the respected director takes office, we hope that he will conform to public opinion and swiftly approve and implement the case that all members of the same industry, whether they have joined the guild or not, must abide by the trade regulations. Then all merchants and people will forever feel the great virtue without limit.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate scheduled to burn the opium and poisons confiscated in the first half of the 19th year yesterday. On the scheduled date yesterday, the court erected a mat shed in front of the detention center for the supervisors to stay. In the afternoon at 2 PM, representatives from various agencies, groups, and party departments arrived one after another, including Yang Zhaoxin and Chen Jingzhai from the Ministry of Justice, Yu Zongjian from the Higher Court, Zhang Yi from the Municipal Party Department, Zhang Yinhuai from the Municipal Government, Zhu Yuntao from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Chen Jiannan from the County Party Department, Chen Guozhen from the County Public Security Bureau, He Xiaosong from the Jianghai Customs, Yu Ding from the Special Zone Local Court, Wang Yun from the Anti-Drug Association, and Ms. Zhou Chucai.

<h3 id="e111">Shanghai Municipal Council <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Decides to Form a Public Debt Custodian Committee, According to the Shanghai Times, in order to fulfill the declaration of selling the electricity department, the Public Concession Municipal Council has decided to form a Municipal Council Public Debt Custodian Committee, which will be established soon to protect the interests of bond purchasers. The committee members will be appointed from Westerners with good reputation. All public debts due for redemption before 1933 will be managed by the committee. The purchase price paid by the Shanghai Power Company, designated for debt repayment, will also be handed over to the committee for safekeeping. In this way, all public debts of the Municipal Council can be repaid by the end of 1933, and new public debts will be raised again in 1934 to meet the needs of municipal construction. According to the Municipal Council, the public debt issued by the Council is guaranteed by the Council's assets and income. Although the assets have decreased after the sale of the electricity department, the Shanghai Power Company still mortgages all its assets to the Municipal Council until the purchase price of 81 million taels is paid in full. Therefore, the public debt collateral has not actually decreased. According to the sales contract of the electricity department, 36.5 million taels of public debt will be transferred to the Shanghai Power Company for repayment, and the remaining 17.5 million taels will be appropriated by the Municipal Council from the purchase price paid by the company before the end of 1933. Now, in order to consolidate the investment security of bond purchasers, the Municipal Council has organized a custodian committee to keep this debt repayment fund. However, the custodian agreement and charter have not yet been drafted. According to the Municipal Council, in addition to the 54 million taels designated for redeeming public debt from the proceeds of the sale of the electricity department, only 27 million taels remain for all construction needs, such as expanding the West Prison, adding schools, adding police stations and hospitals, expanding canals, widening roads, building incinerators, and other urgent projects. According to the Accounting Office, after all public debts are repaid in 1933, 8 million to 10 million taels of new debt will have to be raised in 1934 to meet urgent needs. If this construction budget can be maintained at 6 million taels per year according to the original plan for the next three years, the remaining proceeds from the sale of the electricity department will be sufficient for application. If no new debt is issued, the patrol donation and other items can also be maintained at the old rate without increasing.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Wusong Regional Division Issue <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Government Sends Section Chief Huang Daolin to Songjiang for Investigation, Since the Shanghai Municipal Regional Division Committee included the households of Gang 25, Gang 35, Tui 22, and Tui 35 in the Wusong District into the Yinhang District, the gentry of Wusong, Yin Xiangsun, Dong Mengyi, and others detailed the special circumstances of the households and the difficulties in the terrain, and sent a letter to the Regional Division Committee requesting that the original area be maintained without any changes. This was reported in the newspaper on the 8th. It is now known that the Municipal Government sent Section Chief Huang Daolin (Huang is also the director of the General Affairs Section of the Regional Division Committee) to Songjiang on the afternoon of the day before yesterday to conduct an on-site investigation. He first went to the 7th District of the Public Security Bureau to investigate the household situation, and then went to the Wusong Municipal Committee Office, where he was received by the two members, Tang and Liu, for consultation. Section Chief Huang believed that the residents of the shanty towns in the area had lived there for more than a year, and there were no special circumstances. Therefore, there was no problem in dividing the two maps of Gang 25 and 35 and the Fa Zi embankment of Tui 22 in Yunzao South to the Yinhang District. However, the terrain of Tui 35 in Binbei and Jiang Zi embankment of Tui 22 was not convenient to be divided into the Yinhang District. He will ask the two members, Tang and Liu, to attend the next Regional Division Committee meeting to discuss the matter. Generally, the Yunzao River may be used as a natural boundary, so the sections divided out of Binbei can still be included in the Wusong area. Therefore, the two members, Tang and Liu, have invited the gentry to talk and explain the above situation.</p>

<p>New Locomotives Are Sequentially Produced and Operated, The two railway bureaus have recently found that the weather is getting colder and the locomotive traction is insufficient, resulting in frequent delays in train operations, which is inconvenient for travelers. They have specially taken measures to remedy this. On the one hand, the original old locomotives are being repaired as quickly as possible by opening night shifts. On the other hand, four new Pacific-style locomotives that have been transported have been installed and put into operation. One locomotive was installed last Friday and was tested in Wusong with very satisfactory results. The remaining three locomotives can also be installed and put into operation before the 20th of this month. Four more locomotives will be installed in the middle of next month. After this, the problem of train delays can be completely resolved one after another. The railway bureau is still concerned that there may be shortcomings, so it has put forward measures to designate staff from various departments to form a train delay review committee. Any train delay of more than half an hour will be submitted to the committee for review and punishment. Before the train delay problem is completely resolved, each express train will be staffed by one person from the locomotive and rolling stock departments to stand beside the driver to monitor and prevent negligence and delays, and to maintain the reputation of the railway.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Fog Prevents Merchant Ships from Entering and Exiting Sequentially <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>More than 30 ships were prevented from entering and exiting in two days, In the past two days, heavy fog occurred on the sea surface outside the Wusong estuary. Merchant ships coming to Shanghai from various places were prevented from entering and were anchored at sea for safety. There were 18 ships caught in the fog. There were also more than a dozen ships leaving Shanghai that were prevented from sailing due to the fog at the Wusong estuary. The ships on the sea, fearing collision in the fog, sounded their horns all night long, and the sound continued unabated. Yesterday, when the weather turned cold, the fog dissipated, and the waterways were clear, the ships began to enter the Huangpu River, and those leaving Shanghai also sailed yesterday. The ships that were delayed the most were the merchant ships coming to Shanghai from the Yellow Sea. They all entered the port one after another yesterday, and no accidents occurred.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Progress of Dredging the Shentan Shoal at the Wusong Estuary <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Sends Engineers to Measure, The motion of the Dredging Bureau to dredge the Shentan Shoal (also known as Yinsha) outside the Wusong Estuary has been discussed at the bureau meetings with Chinese and foreign shipping circles twice. It is agreed that in recent years, the displacement tonnage of ships from various countries in the world has doubled, and it often takes a lot of time to bypass the Wusong Estuary, which is a great loss. It is imperative to dig out the Shentan to facilitate navigation. However, this matter is of great importance and the cost is huge. It can only be carried out after sufficient funds are raised. Chinese and foreign shipping circles have mostly agreed to support it, considering that the Shentan survey report refers to the former Technical Committee. It seems that the recent situation of the shoal should be measured in detail to make a practical plan and determine the amount of funding. It was decided to send Oteni, the chief surveyor of the bureau, and Xia Ruifu, the deputy engineer, to lead a team to the Wusong Estuary to conduct a detailed measurement of the Shentan. The base of the Shentan is made of stone or sand, or even has stone roots. It must be measured before construction can begin.</p>

<p>Yesterday Received Gansu Request for Disaster Relief Report, Yesterday, the Chinese Red Cross Society received a telegram from Chen Guizhang, commander of Longdong, Gansu, reporting that the disaster situation in Longdong, Gansu, was waiting to be relieved and needed to be disclosed. The telegram said: "The barren area of ​​the twentieth edition has been trampled on and exploited by warlords for a long time. There is almost no intact area. In addition, there have been continuous years of famine, and the number of deaths is difficult to count. It is unbearable to see. Although the central government has allocated funds for disaster relief, Feng Ni has withheld these funds for his own use, resulting in the disaster-stricken people all dying together. Now that the people's thieves have been eliminated and the dawn has returned, the remaining people are eager to be rescued. Guizhang's job is only to suppress the rebellion, and he dare not ask about all political matters. However, seeing the wailing sounds everywhere and the people waiting to be fed, he cannot bear to sit and watch them die silently. He dares to appeal for disaster relief. May he be allowed to show compassion and save the people. Then the survivors in Longzhong will be able to pray for their recovery. Thank you very much.

<p>Summary of Disaster Relief in Yancheng and Siyang, The Chinese Jisheng Association and the Jiangsu Temporary Disaster Relief Association jointly entrusted Zhou Yuankai and Yu Shujun of the Qingjiangpu Jisheng Branch to handle the winter disaster relief in Shagou Town, Yancheng, Jiangsu, and Siyang County. According to the report of Zhou and Li, they have started to investigate and distribute relief. However, this year's disaster situation in Siyang is extremely serious, and Shagou is also the same. After the natural disaster, there was a bandit disaster. The houses were burned down and became ruins. Thousands of residents were taken over. After the disaster, 70-80% of the survivors were living in the open air, exposed to the wind and rain. At the time of cold weather and heavy snow, they had no clothes, no food, and no shelter. They were full of sorrow and wished they were dead. The previously determined disaster relief funds were not enough. Can you please increase them again to save the lives of those who are about to die? After receiving the letter, the association has transferred the originally scheduled disaster relief funds from the Qingjiangpu Yichang Village to the Shanghai Dade Village. As for the request for additional funds, it is difficult to approve due to the economic difficulties. However, there are many charitable and righteous people in Jiangsu Province who will definitely take into account the severity of the disaster situation and the suffering of the disaster victims in the two counties and come out to rescue them.</p>

<p>In the Cow Dung</p>
<h3 id="e123">A Male Corpse Horrifyingly Appeared <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Face Had Many Knife Wounds, It Was Clearly a Case of Moving the Body After Being Murdered, Yesterday afternoon, an unidentified male corpse was found near the riverbank along Jiaotong Road in Zhabei. Although the deceased was not wearing a long gown, his short shirt and trousers were quite neat, suggesting he might be a respectable merchant. His cheeks had numerous knife wounds, and his neck was tied with a scarf. His chest was stained with fresh blood, and his lower body was naked, with his trousers tangled at his feet. The entire body was deeply buried under a pile of cow dung. Judging from the circumstances, it is presumed that he was stabbed to death, and then his neck was tied with a scarf, and he was carried to the location, covered with cow dung, and deeply buried in the soil, hoping to cover up the tracks. The cause of his death is likely to be murder for money or murder due to adultery. The details are described below:</p>
<p>Falling in a Pool of Blood, Jiaotong Road, about three miles from Shanghai, is a remote area with sparse residents. A few thatched houses are scattered among the fields. The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway is on the left, and the fields are on the right, making it an extremely quiet place. There is a cattle slaughterhouse set up by Fei Xingfa, which consists of three thatched houses and seems to be doing well. In front of the slaughterhouse is a small riverbank where a lot of cow dung is dumped. Yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, a scavenger was turning over the discarded dung when he suddenly discovered a male corpse in the middle. Upon closer inspection, he realized that it was a person who had been stabbed to death and was lying in a pool of blood, a horrifying sight. He shouted loudly, and Wang Amin, the manager of the cattle slaughterhouse, who happened to be outside preparing to urinate, saw the scene and immediately reported it to the police station.</p>
<p>The Deceased's Tragic Condition, Shi Zhaoyu, the patrol chief of the Tanziawan Police Station of the Fourth District Sub-bureau, led police officers to investigate and found that the unidentified male corpse was approximately 30 years old. He was wearing a blue serge jacket with a vest, a white short shirt underneath, and white single trousers pulled down to his ankles. He was wearing white socks but no shoes. He had a round head, and his face had six or seven knife wounds. One knife wound was near his right cheekbone, about an inch long. Another knife wound was below his mouth, penetrating his teeth. His left cheek was covered with knife marks, and a knife wound near his ear exposed the flesh and bone. A few broken teeth were left in his mouth, and everything was stained with red blood. A beige scarf with light blue patterns was tied tightly around his neck, and his entire body was buried deeply in the river mud, about three feet deep. His head was resting on the riverbank, and his feet were submerged in the water. Judging by the freshness of the blood, he must have been murdered not long ago. The cause of his death is mostly likely murder for money, as it is now winter, and pig butchers are emerging. It is likely that the murderer did not have a gun and used the method of using a scarf to strangle the neck. He resisted along the way, resulting in him being stabbed to death. Another speculation is that it was murder due to adultery, as the deceased was only wearing a single pair of trousers and was completely naked below the waist. After the investigation, Patrol Chief Shi reported to the sub-bureau, instructing the local warden Liu San to report the case to the court for verification. As the case involves murder, the sub-bureau has strictly ordered its subordinates to arrest the murderer and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Japanese Man's Grand Swindle <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Lili Company Suffers Heavy Losses. Shanghai, a place where various people gather, is a mix of good and bad. Deceptive tricks emerge one after another, and foreigners disguising themselves as wealthy to swindle gold jewelry and valuables are not uncommon. Yesterday, a major swindle by a Japanese man occurred at the Lili Company on Wusong Road. The incident was quite unusual, and the reporter has recorded the known details as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Man Selects Diamond Jewelry: Around 2 PM yesterday afternoon, a handsome Japanese man, approximately 27 or 28 years old, suddenly arrived at the Lili Jewelry Company at 31 Wusong Road. He claimed he wanted to purchase several high-end jewelry items. The shop assistant asked what he needed, and he replied that he was specifically there to select a diamond ring and a platinum rectangular watch. The shop assistant then took out various watches and rings for the Japanese man to choose from. He ultimately selected a diamond ring and a platinum watch. After examining the goods, he suddenly claimed that he only had Japanese currency on him and needed to have it exchanged at his brother's place. He also needed to show the goods to his brother because he was purchasing them on his behalf.</p>
<p>Company Sends Assistant with Jewelry: The Lili Company asked the Japanese man where his brother was located and what his name was. The Japanese man said his brother was the manager of the Osaka Mercantile Steamship Co. at the intersection of Guangdong Road, named Harada. Lili believed him and sent shop assistant Qian Qingfa, carrying the diamond ring and watch, to follow the Japanese man to the Five Horse Road to collect the payment, which seemed quite reliable. Qian accompanied the Japanese man (who did not leave his name) to the Osaka Company. Unexpectedly, upon arriving at the Nisshin building on Guangdong Road (where the Osaka Company was located), the Japanese man played a trick.</p>
<p>False Letter Used to Obtain Watch and Ring: Inside the Nisshin building, the Japanese man suddenly claimed that his brother was in the Osaka office (in a large room on the west side). He told Qian Qingfa that it was inconvenient for him to enter the office and instructed him to wait on a bench outside the Nisshin Company for a moment. As he spoke, he took out an envelope (Chinese style) from his pocket, sealed tightly on both ends. On the outside, it stated that it contained a 500 yen Japanese money order. He handed it to Qian and ordered him to give him the ring and watch so he could show them to his brother for a moment and then come back to exchange the money. Qian thought this was reliable and did not know that there was another gate on Guangdong Road for entering and exiting (according to Qian's statement to the reporter, it was his first time at the Nisshin building and he thought there was only one entrance from the Bund side). Believing that he had the money order and the man was inside the building, he handed over the jewelry.</p>
<p>Man Vanishes Like a Yellow Crane: The Japanese man took the jewelry and walked around the Nisshin counter towards the Osaka Company, but in reality, he did not enter the Osaka office. Instead, he left through the main gate with the stolen goods. Qian waited inside the Nisshin Company for the Japanese man to come and exchange the money. He waited from 2:30 PM until 3:00 PM, but the man did not return. He became increasingly anxious and went to the west side to look for the Japanese man. He saw that the entrance to the Osaka Company was also the main gate. He realized something was wrong and searched everywhere, upstairs and downstairs, but the man had vanished like a yellow crane.</p>
<p>Fake Money Order Discovered: Unable to find the Japanese man, Qian Qingfa went to the Osaka Company to inquire if such a person existed and if there was a person named Harada working there. The Osaka employee replied that there was no employee with that name. Qian realized he had been swindled and quickly opened the money order the Japanese man had given him, only to find a torn piece of old newspaper. Qian was shocked and immediately returned to the company to report the incident. At the same time, he went to the Japanese consulate to report the swindle. The Japanese consulate immediately sent two Japanese detectives with Qian to inquire at Nisshin and Osaka on Guangdong Road if they had seen the swindler. Both companies replied that they had not paid attention, and it was impossible to investigate immediately. They could only slowly search. Lili suffered a significant loss in this swindle. According to Qian Qingfa, the company had been swindled once before, when a Westerner came to purchase jewelry and the store owner personally delivered it, similar to the current situation.</p>

<p>Barber Shows No Remorse. Stableman Enraged, Gathers Crowd to Cause Trouble.</p>
<p>Fu Aliu, a Yangzhou stableman (also known as Xiaoliuzi) from the horse stable at 38 Great Western Road in Shanghai West, went to the Xinfali Barber Shop at 2054 Jing'an Temple Road on the evening of the 11th to have his face groomed. The barber, Ge Fu, accidentally shaved off a hair from a mole on his face. Fu was enraged and demanded compensation from Ge. Ge showed no remorse, so Fu left in anger. He gathered sixteen of his friends, each wielding axes and iron rulers, and stormed into the Xinfali Barber Shop to confront Ge. Despite attempts to mediate, the enraged group was unreasonable. They dragged Ge outside and beat him severely with axes and iron rulers before scattering. Ge fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The local police precinct received a report and dispatched officers, who took Ge to the hospital by car. They also began investigating the assailants. The police arrested Fu and accomplices, including stablemen Wang Youcai and Shao Qizai, early the next morning. Yesterday morning, they were brought to the District Court. Ge, injured, also appeared in court to describe the incident, stating that Fu had led a gang to attack him. Fu and the others were evasive. Police lawyer Tu Yaotang requested a postponement. Judge Feng ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody for another seven days for further questioning.</p>

<p>Sixteen Yuan Eighty in Opium Debts. Two Fingers Severed.</p>
<p>Zheng Xiangqian, a 28-year-old Chaozhou merchant, runs a bean and wheat shop on Min'guo Road and established the Nine Heavens Club in Taiyuan Lane, Zilaihuo Street, in the French Concession. Yesterday morning at 1:30 AM, more than ten thugs armed with pistols and axes broke into the club and chopped Zheng eight times. He immediately fell unconscious. A detailed investigation of the case is summarized below.</p>
<p>Concubine's Opium Debts: Last spring, Zheng began an affair with a Changzhou woman who frequented the club daily. The woman's father was addicted to opium and owed Zhou, who lived at number 253 Yuqing Lane, a total of sixteen yuan and eighty cents in opium debts. When the debt remained unpaid, the woman returned to Changzhou. Several days ago, Zhou sought out the woman and took her cloak, stating he would return it upon payment of the debt. The woman informed Zheng, who sent a tea server from the club to negotiate with Zhou. The cloak was returned after an agreement was made to repay the debt when the woman's father returned to Shanghai from Changzhou. The day before yesterday, Zhou, accompanied by Ma Pi Asi and a person nicknamed "Sixteen," went to Zheng Xiangqian's place to negotiate. Unable to reach an agreement, they left unhappy.</p>
<p>Dozens of Thugs: Yesterday morning at 1:30 AM, Zheng was having congee with his concubine at the club when more than ten thugs armed with pistols and axes stormed into the west room upstairs. Without asking questions, they chopped Zheng eight times (two fingers were severed, and he sustained one cut each to his waist and arm, and two cuts to his lower body). Zheng fell to the ground in agony. The thugs, seeing their goal achieved, fled downstairs.</p>
<p>Report to Police and Search for Criminals: After the incident, Zheng's concubine reported it to the Da Zimingzhong Police Station. The police chief ordered detectives Gu Mengzhou and armed officers to inspect the scene. Zheng was awakened, and the names of the thugs were determined. The police went to Zhou's residence in Yuqing Lane to arrest him, but the thugs had already fled. They could only return to the scene of the crime and send the injured Zheng to Binlong Hospital on Baker Road. It is said that his injuries are severe and life-threatening.</p>

<h3 id="e128">German Man Violates Firearm Regulations <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Stopped Execution Due to Heart Disease.</p>
<p>Carl Genzow, a 64-year-old German man, was sentenced to two years in prison by the former Provisional Court on June 31 of last year for violating firearm regulations. After entering prison, Carl suffered from heart disease, and any physical exertion caused him to faint. Recently, his condition worsened, and he requested parole from the District Court of the Special District so he could seek medical treatment outside. However, the criminal law stipulates that parole must be requested by the warden of the prison to the Ministry of Justice. The German prisoner's request to the court was not in accordance with the law and was rejected. Now, the prison warden of the prison has reported Carl's condition to the Municipal Council, stating that he has been following prison regulations. They asked if the Special District Court could grant parole. The legal department of the Municipal Council has forwarded the request to the Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Cheng Shangfeng held a hearing and brought Carl to court. Judge Cheng first asked the police lawyer if the request was for parole or suspension of the unserved sentence. He noted that parole is clearly stipulated in Article 93 of the Criminal Law, requiring the warden of the prison to request approval from the Ministry of Justice before parole can be granted. Article 485 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that if a prisoner suffers from an illness that could endanger their life if the sentence is carried out, they may request a suspension of execution for medical treatment. After recovery, they must return to prison. Judge Cheng inquired as to which procedure the police were requesting. The lawyer stated that the police were requesting a suspension of execution. Judge Cheng asked if it was true that the Western prison had a discount on the terms of imprisonment, such as a one-year sentence being reduced to eight months. The lawyer replied that although such a practice existed, it was conditional on the prisoner's behavior and not automatically granted. The lawyer claimed, however, that this prisoner had behaved well in prison and the warden supported such a consideration. Judge Cheng ordered the court staff to escort Carl to the medical examiner for examination. The medical examiner reported that Carl was suffering from severe heart disease and that further imprisonment could endanger his life. The court then ordered Carl Genzow to be released on bail of 1,000 yuan in cash and a guarantor from a firm, for medical treatment. After recovery, the guarantor would ensure that he would return to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence upon summons.</p>

<p>The Taixing'an Bridge and Maojia'bang Bridge in Wusong are essential routes for residents of the northwest countryside of Wusong to reach the town. The two bridges are close to the Yunzao River and the Yong'an and Huafeng Yarn Factories and the China Iron Works, with a large number of workers traveling back and forth every day. Recently, due to years of disrepair, the bridges are on the verge of collapse, making travel dangerous for pedestrians and vehicles. The Wusong Municipal Committee Office sent personnel to investigate. Considering the importance of transportation, a request was submitted to the Municipal Public Works Bureau for an appropriation to rebuild the bridges. The Public Works Bureau has approved the request. Workers have already been hired to begin rebuilding the Maojia'bang Bridge. The materials for the Taixing'an Bridge have also been delivered and construction will begin soon.</p>

<p>Over 2,000 Cabbages Lost. Lives and Cargo Saved.</p>
<p>Around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, a storm suddenly broke out. The storm was particularly fierce outside the Wusong estuary. Zhu Changfa, a Chongming boat carrying more than 3,000 cabbages to Songjiang for sale, encountered the sudden storm at the Sanjiakou estuary. The situation was difficult to manage, and there were fifteen passengers on board, including men and women. Seeing that the wind was strong and the boat was tilting, they panicked and cried. The boat owner, seeing the situation was not good, ordered the crew and passengers to throw the cabbages into the sea. After throwing away more than 2,000 cabbages, the boat gradually stabilized. The sails were lowered, and the boat drifted with the wind. The storm subsided until midnight, and they were able to escape the danger. The boat arrived in Wusong around 7:00 AM yesterday morning. According to the boat owner, it was fortunate that they were willing to sacrifice more than 2,000 cabbages to save the lives of over twenty people on board and the cargo.

<p>The case of Russian engineer Qianluosiding injuring a worker with a gun on Yuyuan Road has been reported previously. It is said that the Russian, in order to escape the jurisdiction of the inland court, sued the worker in the Special District Court for obstructing freedom. The Special District Court then requested the extradition from the inland court. Chief Prosecutor Liu Maochu cited Article 17 of our country's criminal procedure and criminal law, which clearly stipulates that if the same case is accepted by two or more courts of the same level, the court that first accepted the case should continue to handle it. A case should not have two trials. Furthermore, the Yuyuan Road area is not within the concession. Although Article 5 of the agreement between the Special District Court states that the court's jurisdiction is unrelated to road construction issues, this case is not related to road construction, and the crime occurred in our country. We cannot easily condone the invasion of our country's legal rights by foreigners. Chief Prosecutor Liu served as a counselor and special envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs several years ago and has extensive knowledge and experience in foreign affairs.</p>

<p>Da Zhonghua Fountain Pen Factory is the first company in our country to manufacture fine fountain pens. It has been in operation for two years. Sales have been brisk in the last two to three months. Overseas Chinese in the Nanyang Islands are the most enthusiastic buyers. The pens are sturdy, the nibs are durable, and the decorations are as good as foreign products. Yong'an, Sincere, Li Hua, and other major companies in Shanghai are selling the pens. The factory has been registered by the government and has sent samples to various government agencies to promote national products. The prices range from eight yuan, six yuan, four yuan, and two yuan, which are more than half the price of foreign goods. To thank the public for their support, the company is planning to host a banquet at the Dadong Restaurant this Sunday afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Accidental Killing of Wang Jingtao by Indian Soldiers: An Unresolved Case <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Widow Pleads for Compensation  Wang Mao appeals for 20,000 yuan in compensation  Shanghai Municipal Council only willing to provide 100 yuan in relief  Wang Jingtao, a local resident living in Wangjiazhai, Yinxiang District, who worked in the leather shoe industry, was returning home at 7:30 PM on March 31st of the 16th year of the Republic of China. He was separated from his house by a field embankment. In front of his house, at the border of the Chinese concession, the Shanghai Municipal Council had erected barbed wire. When Wang attempted to cross the barbed wire, a stationed Indian soldier mistakenly fired two shots, both hitting Wang in vital areas. He died despite medical treatment. Li Jinfu, a judge from the former Provisional Court, confirmed the death and allowed Wang's widow, Wang Mao, to claim the body for coffin preparation. He also instructed her to negotiate with the embassy and report the incident. However, Mao, being an ignorant woman, delayed the matter until now, causing the deceased to suffer in silence and unable to find justice. Currently, Mao has two sons and two daughters who all need to attend school. Moreover, her husband's coffin remains exposed and unburied. Her wages from working in a yarn factory are meager and insufficient to support her family. Therefore, she submitted a petition to Edward, the General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting compensation of 20,000 yuan for Wang's loss of life based on responsibility (Wang earned over 60 yuan per month and, based on a life expectancy of 60 years, the total loss would be 20,000 yuan over 25 years). After receiving the petition, the Shanghai Municipal Council sent personnel to investigate the Donghua Yarn Factory where Mao works and agreed to provide Mao with a relief fund of 100 yuan. Mao refused, stating that her husband was a law-abiding civilian mistakenly killed by an Indian soldier. The Indian soldier was requested by the Shanghai Municipal Council to maintain public security within the concession. Since the Indian soldier caused the accident, the Shanghai Municipal Council should be responsible for compensating the loss of life and providing condolences to the family. Therefore, she rejected the 100 yuan relief fund. Yesterday, she again submitted a petition to Edward and Fessenden, urging them to promptly provide compensation to value human life and uphold justice. It is said that Mao is an old-fashioned woman who highly values etiquette and teaching. She has remained a widow to raise her children, enduring hardship and loneliness, and is praised by relatives and neighbors who sympathize with her.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Tan Zhizheng on Returning from Yunnan and Guizhou <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Yunnan and Guizhou are located in the western frontier, important for our country's border defense. However, due to transportation difficulties, they are often overlooked by our countrymen. Last year, the Ministry of Railways sent specialists to the two provinces to conduct on-site surveys for national railway routes, which took half a year to complete. Recently, Zhang Fuquan, the section chief from Jiaotong University in this city, who was one of the survey specialists, was specially invited to the university to give a lecture on his experiences, which was very interesting. I am recording some of it here, hoping it will be of interest to those who care about border affairs.  How to Get There To go from Shanghai to Yunnan, one must pass through French Indochina. First, take a ship from Shanghai to Hong Kong, then from Hong Kong to Haiphong in Indochina, and then take the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway directly to Kunming. To enter Guizhou from Yunnan, one can take a sedan chair from Kunming for about 18 days to reach Guiyang. If starting from Shanghai, one must first go to Chongqing and then take a sedan chair to Guiyang, a journey of 900 li, which takes about 15 days. The transportation can be said to be extremely inconvenient. Sedan chair carriers feel exhausted after traveling 70 li per day. The hardship of living in a sedan chair for more than ten days is indescribable.  Characteristics of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is 800 li long, slightly longer than the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. However, while the Beijing-Shanghai Railway can be reached in seven or eight hours, the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway takes at least three days. This is because the railway is narrow-gauge and travels very slowly, and it also stops running at night. The most interesting thing is that the railway has as many as 149 tunnels, as if the train is traveling through mountain roads.  Special Climate The climate in both provinces is very mild. In Kunming, the highest temperature in summer is only 70 or 80 degrees. At night, one cannot sleep without a cotton quilt. The same is true in Guiyang. However, there is one unique point: once it rains, the climate suddenly becomes cold. There is a local saying: "Four seasons without hot or cold, one rain turns it into winter," which is indeed true.  Remarkable Scarcity of Population Due to transportation blockages, the population of the two provinces is extremely sparse. Except for one or two large cities, the remaining county towns have only a few dozen households, which is even smaller than a small village in Jiangsu Province. In recent years, the country has often worried about the increase in population. It should be known that the border areas are the best places for immigration, and the mild climate is especially suitable for southerners.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Understanding Bird Language by Ji Xian <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>My neighbor, Mr. Zhu, is very fond of raising birds, especially parrots. Last month, he happened to visit the Yimiao Temple and bought two parrots from a shop, one male and one female. He loved them very much. Sometimes he would let them fly freely in the wind, enjoying each other's company or making chirping sounds, as if they were conversing. However, Zhu believed that there must be words to understand. Therefore, he separated the male and female parrots. When the male chirped, he would hold a megaphone to the female's ear. After hearing it, the female would flutter her wings, looking for something. Zhu would then pick up the megaphone and listen carefully, and he would hear two phrases, seemingly asking for water and looking for food. Therefore, he would transmit these phrases to the male, and the male would understand, and his actions would be the same as before. Zhu was overjoyed. He predicted that in a few months, he would be able to understand many more phrases. Gongye Chang's ability to understand bird language would not be unique to him.</p>

<p>B: What did the ghost shadow look like?</p>
<p>A: It was very scary, like an evil dog standing on its hind legs. After a while, it disappeared.</p>
<p>B: You're mistaken. That was your own shadow.</p>
<p>Never Eating Rice The people of Yunnan, except for the very wealthy who can afford to eat rice, mostly eat corn. The poorest people eat sweet potatoes. Most people never eat rice in their lives. The low standard of living can be imagined.</p>
<p>The Plague of Miasma The greatest disaster in Yunnan is the miasma. People die instantly when they are exposed to it. Where this gas comes from is still uncertain, and there is a lack of preventive measures. Also, both Yunnan and Guizhou provinces are thousands of feet above sea level, which will be a major obstacle to future railway construction.</p>
<p>Abundant Mineral Resources Both provinces have extremely rich mineral resources. Yunnan's antimony is the most famous, and Guizhou's mercury accounts for 9% of the world's production, making it a huge resource. If they can be developed carefully, the natural resources are beyond imagination.</p>
<h3 id="e158">A Bronze Buddha Weighing 63,000 Jin by Zheng Yimei <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>In Nanchang, Jiangxi, there is a temple called Youmin Temple. It was originally Youqing Temple during the Qing Dynasty, but it was renamed to its current name after the Republic of China. In fact, there is a bronze Buddha in the temple, its color dark and old, said to be from the Liang Dynasty. It is more than two zhang tall, and the top of the Buddha and the ridge weigh a total of 63,000 jin. An American archaeologist named Miss Leight visited and wrote a book called "The Beauty of the Orient," calling it the world's first ancient bronze Buddha and attaching a photo to highlight its importance. It is said that a rascal lived in the temple. This rascal, named Jia, extorted money from all sides, and people looked at him with disdain. One day, without wearing pants, he went to the market wearing a long gown and went to a clothing store to buy pants. The clerk showed him a silk pair. Jia put them on to cover himself, as if testing the fit. However, he asked the clerk to bring out more items for him to choose from. Then, they argued about the price, and Jia prepared to leave. The clerk stopped him and said that he had to take off the pants he was wearing to return them. Jia pretended to be angry and said that the pants were originally his own, and how could they be claimed by someone else? Moreover, he only had one pair of pants, and there was no way he could enter the market naked. They argued endlessly, and the onlookers thought Jia was in the right, and the clerk could not defend himself. He also once ate at a noodle shop, but the owner refused to give him credit. Jia resented this. One day, he invited several of his cronies to go to the noodle shop and gorge themselves. After a while, two people suddenly came to the door and started arguing over something, eventually fighting each other. The cronies scattered and fled without paying a single penny. The fighters also ran away. This was a prearranged plan. Jia's bad behavior is too numerous to list. He lived in the temple for many years. Suddenly, one night, he had a dream that the bronze Buddha fell down and crushed his head. Jia woke up in a great fright. From then on, his behavior became erratic, his speech was nonsensical, and he confessed his sins. Not long after, he drowned himself in the river. Therefore, the local people all said that it was the spirit of the bronze Buddha that had brought down the punishment. This is an absurd tale, but we can listen to it with a grain of salt. I suspect it was a neurological issue.</p>

<p>The history of the development of Western art can be roughly divided into two major eras: one is the Renaissance period, which lasted for about 150 years in the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries, centered in Italy and developing to France, the Netherlands, and other places. The main theme was the reverence for ancient art. The other is modern art since the Impressionist era, which began in the nineteenth century and is centered in France.</p>

<p>Burma is a Buddhist country. Now the power of national education and local affairs all comes from the monks. The Burmese monks we speak of are not necessarily true monks. Rather, when children of each family reach the age of study, they are sent to temples to be guided by monks in all matters of moral and artistic learning. After several years, they return to their hometown, glorifying their village. It would be better to call them student monks. However, I believe this method is very good. The Datong School can emulate it. While serving as monks, they abandon all desires, and request silence and endure hard work, which is enough to cultivate their personality. I said to Master Wan, "If the Burmese had 100,000 soldiers, the British would not dare to control them." He replied, "Monks are even harder to control because there are no rules to restrain them." Even so, in a national era, it is difficult to win without clear hierarchy. In short, the mixture of religion and education in Burma resembles the scholastic education of the West in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and the Terakoya education of Japan before the Meiji Restoration. Some parts may be adopted for use in a Datong world that is separated from the government.  On the 12th, I lectured at the Overseas Chinese School on the true value of knowledge. This topic was extracted from the first chapter of Kropotkin's "Mutual Aid." Kropotkin opposes the entire world of intellectuals, and all great philosophers such as Kant, Comte, and Spencer were overthrown by him because they could not directly solve the science of human society. The most urgent thing now is to solve society, and we do not have time for religion and metaphysics. The result of advocating war and class struggle is that people kill people, which is no better than cattle and dogs without knowledge. Therefore, people should use proper knowledge to seek solutions to avoid strife and killing, which is true knowledge. Otherwise, knowledge is only knowledge of killing and suicide. All intellectuals should repent early and seek true knowledge. True knowledge is to reach the realm of supreme good Datong without mutual killing. Tong Liu was running a poor people's school there and invited me to visit and observe the Qiankun School in Huangshuitian. They drew water from their own wells, which was very good. They have been running the school for more than ten years. They were former Christians.  And influencing all of Europe.</p>
<p>Domestic researchers of Western art do not hesitate to travel long distances to Europe to study, which is an appropriate action for scholars. However, some people tell jokes, "If a dog goes to Europe and runs around for a few years, it will probably still just be a dog." Although this is too harsh, there is deep meaning in it. Because no matter what subject you study, if you do not understand the method of research, you will not gain much. If you blindly follow or chase trends to gain the title of a European student or a PhD, then the meaning of what you study will be very poor. Also, if a generation of art researchers goes to Europe because they admire the scenery or are fascinated by the material civilization, and the result is that they only bring back some Western landscapes and pictures of magnificent architecture, there is not much value in their personal research. And how can they meet the expectations of their domestic comrades? I think that studying the evolution of Western art with a diligent and quiet attitude and a historical perspective is the most important thing for going to Europe to study art.  My old friend Wang Yachen has been studying Western painting for more than ten years. In order to make a thorough effort, he went to Europe with his wife, Ms. Rong Junli, in the spring of the seventeenth year. Recently, he returned to China with his works, including 49 copies of representative European paintings from the Renaissance to modern times. Most of the pictures are the same size as the originals. He put almost all of his energy into it for two years. As for his own creations, they were all quick sketches made in a short time, just to leave a mark of his stay in Europe. Many of my friends have gone to Europe to study art, and there are many who have brought back copies of famous European paintings, but few have focused on the two major eras of Western art and engaged in systematic research. In just two years, he has achieved so much and made such a great contribution to domestic researchers of Western art. I would not say that there will be no one like him in the future, but I dare to say that there has been no one like him before. I am just writing down my thoughts, and I cannot avoid offending people. If you say I am flattering, that is not what I am doing.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Three Character Classic Riddles by Tao Zaidong <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>It is difficult to create riddles that are simple but accurate and complete. It is best to use common books as the base, such as the Four Books and the Three Hundred Tang Poems, which everyone is familiar with. If you use obscure books, it is no different from deliberately making things difficult for the answerer and the riddle maker, and those who hear it will not be interested. The Three Character Classic is the most common book. Recently, my friends gathered and used riddles to pass the wine around, using the Three Character Classic to create dozens of them. Among them, several are based on the Three Character Classic and meet the principle of making things difficult to show skill. I am recording them here for the review of my colleagues at the publication.</p>

<p>Seek Ai when sick, this is an ancient teaching. I have always been weak, and after marriage, I took on heavy family responsibilities, which gradually led to overwork and illness. At first, I only thought it was a common flu, but then the cough became frequent, and I also had night sweats and coughing up blood. This was undoubtedly pulmonary tuberculosis without waiting for a doctor's diagnosis. For two and a half years, I spent a lot of money on medicine, but it was not effective, and I tried many miraculous prescriptions and secret remedies. There are many fake medicines in the world. Although newspapers often reveal them, they are often just advertisements. I was only suffering from a long-term illness and was often moved by what I saw. I still remember that the Shenbao published a small talk on medicine by Mr. Zhang on December 12th, which described his experience. I had similar feelings. Thanks to the Yijin Grass issued by the Peisheng Pharmaceutical Company at No. 203 Zhonghua Road, Shanghai, I was cured. It was said that this grass had been tested by the Central Health Testing Institute and certified by the famous doctor Bu Linwu, which made it more reliable. I still held on to my preconceived notions and did not try it. Then I went to ask the old doctor Ding Fubao about the seven of its aspects, and then I bought it and took it. As Mr. Zhang said, I was cured immediately. Now, suddenly, a year has passed. Recently, I heard that the herb has been certified by Dr. Ye Boyang of Baolong Hospital, which shows its miraculous effect and further convinces me that my recovery was not accidental. Therefore, I am writing this new medical commentary to record my happiness.</p>

<p>Turbulent Gold Bar Market: Rising to Falling... A Clear Reaction. Range of Fluctuations Reached Thirteen Taels Plus</p>
<p>Yesterday, December 13th, the gold bar market was extremely chaotic. The strong became weak, a muddled situation causing great alarm. Rising and falling abruptly, revolving around several taels, became commonplace. Dealers lost all sense of direction.  In half a day, a total of thirteen taels and more were traded. Overseas silver markets continued to plummet, especially in the United States, which tended to sell off.  The opening price was at a high, and then a new era began, breaking through 652 taels. However, the selling sentiment in the market was fervent. Source Cheng, Zhi Feng, Yong Yu, Da, and certain large houses tended to sell off, inquiring how much they were willing to offer. Yuan Mao Yong and others sought supply again and again. Li Wan Xing, Yuan Heng, Yong Heng, and others were buying in.  Overseas interest rates tended towards relaxation and rampant issuance, and the listed rate was reduced by another grade, tantamount to tightening secretly and loosening overtly.  The gold market suddenly weakened, with a rapid retreat like a surging tide, the waves roaring. The selling pressure was fierce, plummeting more than ten taels. Suddenly, it broke the 40-tael barrier. Afterwards, the situation became bizarre and unpredictable.  It hovered between 41-42 taels to 45-46 taels. Various firms' cash flow was irregular, almost like the wandering and confused hearts of people.  Finally, it settled around 41 taels, while exchange rates still tended to tighten. This morning, large silver bars might rebound two-fifths.  The New York silver market might add one-half in anticipation of confirmation. Because the market coincided with the 16th, as customary, the market...once revealed (illegible) 52 taels 4. Since the morning, the spot price opened at 652 taels and 2 mace, immediately rising 3 taels and 9 mace (the gross price rose from 53.3 taels to more than 1 tael, then back to more than 54 taels. Buying and selling at various houses diverged). Large silver bars plummeted by two-fifths of a penny. The forward price was down 16/7. The silver price shrunk by a huge 1.375. Private telegrams were the same, so people's hearts were greatly encouraged.  Soon after, a new high price of 53 taels and 4 mace appeared. However, Source Cheng, Zhi Feng, Yong Yu, Da, Heng Yu, etc. were eager to sell. Yuan Mao Yong also sold, so the price seemed to fall thousands of feet in a whirlwind. Plunging ten taels, only 42 taels. The margin notes changed from firm to loose.  The initial settlement of March English gold was 1.5375. Then, Taiwan and others offered 1.5625.  The Bank of China bought $35.625 this month. The price then rebounded 3 taels. Retail investors chased after the rise and first ordered the quotation to shrink by .25.  The US dollar rose by half a yuan, and the Japanese gold added 2 fen, so it rose to 45 taels.  Because March English gold still settled at .625, McCarly once sold January gold at 1.56875 and had already retreated to 42.5 taels.  Then, Da De Cheng and others bought in and added 2 taels at 9:45 AM to 44 taels and 5 mace. The bizarre changes finally decreased by 7 taels and 3 mace, but Source Cheng, Yu Da, and others' selling intentions were still strong.  In an instant, it drained more than 5 taels, and at 10:00 AM, it suddenly became 39 taels.  After that, buyers were active again, due to the lack of silver bars and the urgency of raising the local price. The foreign exchange market also turned stable, so Mitsui absorbed Dalian at 1 tael, 3 mace, 8 fen, 7.5 li.  March English gold only settled at 1.5625. Hedging firms rushed to settle.  Then, in March, Japanese firms made a deal at .5625, and Yuan Mao Yong, Tai Kang Run, Chun Fa, Yong Yu, Da, and others in the market all chased after the rise.  Suddenly, it leapt six or seven taels until 11:15 AM, totaling 46 taels, 2 mace, and 3 mace. Then, it suddenly turned downward, because Tong Tai Chang, Xin Heng, and others tended to sell off. In just over ten minutes, it plunged 4 taels. At 11:30 AM, it was 42 taels.  Immediately, it shouted up 2 taels, totaling 44 taels, but there were not many recipients, so it was still in a soft and decadent state.  Yu Da and zero accounts were quick to sell. At 11:50 AM, it totaled 40 taels, zero mace, three or four mace. Immediately, it was pulled up 1 tael and zero mace to 41.5 taels.  However, the market was chaotic and difficult to grasp.  It then weakened 1 tael, totaling 41 taels at noon closing, down 7 taels and 3 mace from the previous day.  Afterwards, there were mutual increases and decreases of 1 tael and zero mace, remaining within 41 taels.  The highest price in half a day was 52 taels and 4 mace. The lowest price was 29 taels (referring to the listed price), a difference of 13 taels and 4 mace.  Goods opened at 32 taels and 2 mace in the morning, and the closing price at noon was changed to 686 taels and 8 mace, with the Japanese gold listed 2 fen higher. Initially, 42 taels to 44 taels.  Afterwards, 47 or 48 taels became 42 taels again. At noon, 46 taels, up 16-17 taels from the previous day. The desire for speculation was strong, and cash flow was particularly divergent. Transactions among colleagues were enthusiastic and busy, but chaotic and divergent. Source Cheng, Yu Da, Tong Tai Chang, Yuan Xing Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Heng Yu, Heng Xing, Xin Heng, etc. all sold. Da De Cheng, Yuan Mao Yong, Hong Li, Heng Xing Yuan, Sen Chang Yong, Bing Xing, etc. had mixed entries and exits and smooth transactions. Wan Xing, Yong Feng, Yuan Heng, etc. sought more than they supplied. Tai Kang Run, Yu Fa Yong, Yong...all advanced. It was heard that Source Cheng sold more than 2,000 bars on behalf of Luo's Dalian gang, and a total of 3,000 bars were bought and 1,600-1,700 bars were sold. The Guangdong gang...sold hundreds of bars.</p>

At noon, it eased slightly, indeed because the gold market was sharp and then soft, and the situation was extremely dangerous. In half a day, there were more than 13 taels of ups and downs, which was extremely difficult to deal with. The new record of 652 taels had never been seen before.

<p>New York Telegram on the 12th Reports the Raw Cotton in a Week. The Cotton Market Saw the Low Peak of This Season Again Last Week, Probably Because Bulls Settled and Southern Intermediaries Sold Out. Industry Demand Has Not Seen Activity. As for the Sharp Fall in the Egyptian Cotton Market, the Weakness of Ordinary Commerce, the Decline in Securities, and the Increase in the Global Inventory Statistics of US Cotton by More Than 1.5 Million Bales, All of Which Are Enough to Induce a Selling Trend. The Government's Last Estimate Made the Empty Willingness Slightly Replenished, But On the One Hand, Those Who Did Not Dare to Sell Easily Because of the Uncertainty of the Reported Numbers Previously Were Now Relieved of Their Constraints. When Prices Fall, There Are Reports of Industry and Speculators Buying in. They Believe That Reducing Planting Can Increase Their Power Because of the Sharp Fall. When They Are Annoyed by the Rebound, They Turn Weak Again, Covering Whether the Market is Sufficient to Develop. Attached Weekend Statistics Are as Left (Unit: Thousands of Bales)</p>

<h3 id="e179">Zhou Xushan on Jiangwan Road <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>After viewing the Shanghai Art Academy's daytime exhibition, because of sitting on tatami mats, it affects the racial heredity. The short-legged, wide-bodied Japanese troops make us feel both comical and surprised. The neat uniforms reflect loyal, stingy faces. No matter how they walk, they can't quite shake off the swaggering gait of Western European soldiers. It can be said that they still retain the original form of dragging wooden clogs, walking with their feet turned inward in a difficult manner. On sunny days, they practice bull-like fighting techniques on the field. The sound of bayonet thrusts is like a wounded female leopard, terrifying and fierce. On rainy days, they practice this combat in their large houses, truly admiring their enthusiastic training, which almost never ceases. They can also skillfully use artillery tactics and foot-powered machine gun carts, speeding across the Jiangwan Road near the shooting range.</p>
<p>In Russia, which sparked a social revolution during the World War, White Russian youths who failed and fled to Shanghai have nothing to do. They are hired as military personnel, wearing yellow uniforms and carrying short guns, and are often transported by trucks to the shooting range to practice shooting. In their deep-set, yellowish-blue eyes, almost everyone emits the fierce intent of alcohol. Although they also train hard in a serious, disciplined, militarized manner, their interpersonal connections seem to have lost their center, thus appearing somewhat like they are just going through the motions with the firearms for the sake of bread. They squander their lives residing in China with decadent exile and enjoyment.</p>
<p>From dawn to dusk every day, the sound of rifles and machine guns from the shooting range continuously assaults our eardrums. They, the Japanese soldiers, White Russian soldiers, British and American soldiers, and soldiers from France and Italy, are all practicing, seemingly taking their assigned missions very seriously, pushing them to the extreme. We know that this is the model produced by Darwinism since the 19th century, becoming the national oppressor of our country, the oppressor of other nations. To put it bluntly, it is the weapon of those who have invaded the weak for the past eighty years.</p>
<p>Our nation, historically known for its great assimilative power, is helpless. This is very obvious. A nation without progress in natural sciences naturally has no possibility of assimilating others. Apart from resorting to integrity to call for large-scale resistance movements, on the one hand, and being assimilated by others, on the other hand, there is almost no other way to think of it. The white and red blood of the past few decades are the expressions of sorrow of our nation's intellectual exhaustion, depleted strength, and erratic behavior. Recently, the imposing manner on the shooting range has affected the eyes and ears of passersby.</p>
<p>Now our nation has awakened in many ways, of course, due to being stimulated too deeply, and we cannot help but raise up. In Shanghai, our national cultural movement is also particularly concentrated on Jiangwan Road.</p>
<p>The national cultural movement on Jiangwan Road is multifaceted, such as social, natural scientific, political, and even artistic and literary, all very active. Among them, the paintbrush is what we often admire and pay attention to. The color and the sound of guns of Darwinism almost occupy the area of the shooting range and Jiangwan Road. The sound of guns has been mentioned earlier; the paintbrush is what I want to talk about now.</p>
<p>In fact, paintbrushes are not commonly seen on Jiangwan Road, but some people holding paintbrushes are seen walking on the road. We have not seen the effects of people holding paintbrushes in ordinary times. It is not like the guns at the shooting range, which seem to be making a great noise.</p>
<p>Today, I strolled into the Shanghai Art Academy's exhibition of student works. The sound of guns from the shooting range was firing continuous tunes. Beforehand, I also encountered a large number of artillery vehicles, all driven by Japanese soldiers, seemingly patrolling around Jiangwan Road with a purpose. I spent an hour amidst the sound of target practice, completing my viewing of the paintings. After leaving the exhibition hall, I had an unforgettable impression in my mind. This unforgettable impression is roughly of two types, but I cannot judge for myself whether these two types of impressions are reasonable. It is just an expression of the heart's jumping in response to the scene.</p>
<p>Now let me write down these two types of impressions lingering in my mind in separate points.</p>
<p>The first type belongs to the objects under the paintbrush; this includes three kinds:</p>
<p>(A) Purely aesthetic, somewhat with hedonistic interest.</p>
<p>(B) Naturalistic (such as still life, landscapes, etc.), with a style of imitation.</p>
<p>(C) The national soul squeezed out by Darwinism.</p>
<p>Regarding type A objects, based on the overall ratio of exhibits in the exhibition, they account for about one-fourth of the total, such as the works of Chen Baoyi, Ms. Guan Zilan, Japanese Mr. Hase Kosho, Man.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Gusisiro and Mr. Wang Daoyuan are mostly of this type. The works of some students are also often buried in this category.</p>
<p>Regarding type B objects, they account for approximately two-thirds of the total output, mainly consisting of Ni Yide, Japanese Mr. Nakagawa Kigen, Mei Yuan Long Saburo, and most students' imitations of the willows and catkins along the West Lake.</p>
<p>Regarding type C objects, they are the fewest among the exhibits, mainly consisting of Zhu Yingpeng, and a small number of similar works by Yang Qiuren and Zeng Zhiliang.</p>
<p>The second type belongs to the social experience under the paintbrush; this can also be divided into three types:</p>
<p>(D) Engaged in the world and with rich social observation.</p>
<p>(E) Immersed in sweet dreams and with considerable innocence.</p>
<p>(F) Neither worldly nor unworldly, but having lost the emotions of childhood.</p>
<p>Regarding type D social experience, Wang Daoyuan, Zhu Yingpeng, and Japanese Mr. Akita Yoshiichi are the most abundant, thus creating a feeling of mutual understanding and secluded paths leading to the depths, enabling viewers to obtain a powerful response amidst the sound of guns surrounding the shooting range.</p>
<p>Regarding type E, Ni Yide and Chen Baoyi are the most abundant. From the viewer's perspective, the two authors seem to be proponents of art for art's sake, regardless of whether it is art for life or art for art's sake. In short, social experience is indispensable. To put it bluntly, we cannot leave society. Mr. Ni is a writer and someone I admire and respect the most. Because my hopes are too high, I unconsciously speak excessively. I think Mr. Ni would not consider my words to be obscene exaggeration. Finally, I offer him the phrase "walking from the ivory tower to the crossroads."</p>
<p>Regarding type F, Ms. Guan Zilan's paintings are abundant.</p>
<p>Just as I was writing the manuscript, the sound of night target practice from the shooting range rose sharply, as if telling me to put down my pen. Miscellaneous literary talk.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Ruskin's Peculiarity <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Ruskin's favorite books in his childhood were the Psalms of the Old Testament and Byron's "Childe Harold." His mother, rich in religious sentiment, was often very enthusiastic about his love of Byron's works.</p>
<p>But Ruskin naturally wouldn't become the kind of man in "Childe Harold." He loved nature, although he was born in the bustling center of London and spent his life there. He was still a singer of nature. Looking at the always azure sky from the beautiful rooftop of the Guvar's house, Ruskin had infinite poetic aspirations for it. His unparalleled work "Modern Painters" can also be said to have arisen from this keen sense of loving nature.</p>
<p>He had a strange aversion to railroads.</p>
<p>"Traveling by rail is not traveling; it's just shipping goods."</p>
<p>He felt this way from the bottom of his heart, believing that the presence of railroads would reduce the beautiful influence of nature on people's minds.</p>
<p>Seeing today's web-like railways, one wonders how Ruskin would sigh. Living in modern times, we can only give him a desolate smile in response to his quirk.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he passed away from this world in 1899. (Su)</p>

<h3 id="e182">A Trip to Zhenjiang by Wang Chengzi <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>At nine o'clock in the evening, our biology department students on the third floor of the Zibin Courtyard were walking around, talking, laughing, and breaking through the cold, silent, and cool air of this night. At this time, luggage was ready and waiting to depart for a trip to Zhenjiang. After about half an hour, sitting in the car, our hearts had already flown to our destination with the speed of lightning. Everything in front of us was blurred. Arriving at the North Railway Station and getting on the train, although it was still early before the train departed, the crowd was surging and extremely crowded. It was only with great difficulty that we grabbed a space in the back to arrange our positions.</p>
<p>Inside, the students were feeling a little uneasy in the bad air and dense fog of cigarettes.</p>
<p>During the train ride, amidst the fatigue and boredom, we found some laughter to invigorate our spirits. Mr. Chen was the most talkative among the students. He said everything, and if he had something to say, he would say it. If he had nothing to say, he would find an opportunity to say something. It just so happened that an old gentleman sitting next to him was from the same hometown. As soon as they met, they merged like water and milk, opening their talkative boxes.</p>
<p>"I am also from Ningbo," the old gentleman said.</p>
<p>"Yes, we are all from the same hometown," Mr. Chen also said.</p>
<p>"Who are the members of your family?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Parents, brother..." Mr. Chen replied.</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Ah, I know your brother very well, he is my friend." I only heard this sentence from their conversation.</p>
<p>"What school do you study at and where are you traveling to?" he asked again.</p>
<p>"We are Fudan Biology Department students traveling to Zhenjiang," Mr. Chen replied.</p>
<p>"Are there male and female students in your school? How many female students are there?" He turned his eyes and asked them like that.</p>
<p>"There are more than one hundred female students in total," Mr. Chen replied. Their conversation then turned again.</p>
<p>"When people go out, they rely entirely on friends. Like us, everyone is a friend."</p>
<p>"Speaking is also very important. When you go to a place, you must be able to speak the language of that place. Like Chiang Kai-shek, when he gave speeches in Guangdong, he spoke Cantonese, when he was in the south, he spoke Mandarin, and when he returned to his hometown, he spoke the local dialect."</p>
<p>Their expressions were truly amusing, and their voices were especially loud, causing us all to stare and laugh foolishly. But they didn't feel it at all and were still talking endlessly.</p>
<p>(Taken by Bing) in the female dormitory of Jinan University.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu, who studied abnormal psychology, said, "These two people might have some kind of psychological abnormality."</p>
<p>"Talking too much is also a kind of disease," Mr. Xu also said.</p>
<p>"These two lunatics are simply a natural match, made for each other," Mr. Wang added.</p>
<p>"Hahaha," we couldn't help but burst into laughter when we talked about this matter.</p>
<p>It was late at night, and fatigue urged us into the dreamland we were yearning for.</p>
<p>···········</p>
<p>We all woke up in the faint light of dawn. Mr. Chen could be said to have slept the most comfortably last night because he slept on the luggage rack. Second was Mr. Wang. It was a pity that they really didn't get any sleep all night.</p>
<p>"It's almost seven o'clock now, but we've only passed XX," Mr. Wang said anxiously after looking at his watch.</p>
<p>"Taking a rickshaw would be faster than this," Mr. Lu also frowned and said.</p>
<p>"I heard that the train derailed the day before yesterday, so today it's especially fast and changed to especially slow," a guest said.</p>
<p>Looking at the trees outside the window, they all seemed to be shaking listlessly, making the train seem even slower.</p>
<p>·······</p>
<p>At more than nine o'clock, we finally reached our destination. We sat on rickshaws and walked through the streets, like a long snake, attracting passersby to stare with strange eyes. After about a meal's worth of time, we arrived at the Yipinxiang Hotel. At this time, we were hungry, so after a little grooming, we left the hotel alley and walked into a Wanhualou restaurant. We surrounded a round table. First, three large basins of Zhenjiang's famous dish, stewed pork, were brought over. The flavor of this foreign land was truly delicious. In a short while, it was all eaten up.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu sat high in the seat of honor, his face like a Lohan and his body like a tumbler, showing the appearance of a northerner. He kept shouting, "Hurry up and bring the steamed buns and sesame cakes."</p>
<p>"Mr. Xu, you're rushing your second life again."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang said to him. This was a story from before when they went to Mogan Mountain. Mr. Xu once said that calling for steamed buns and sesame cakes was his second life.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lu sweats the most when he eats," a student said.</p>
<p>"Old Lu, why didn't you bring that big towel?" Mr. Wang asked jokingly.</p>
<p>"I lost it last year when I was swimming in Hangzhou," he replied with a chuckle.</p>
<p>We finished eating the refreshments in conversation and laughter. Mr. Xu no longer needed his second life. Old Lu's face was glowing with sweat and his stomach was patting loudly.</p>
<p>Returning to the hotel, because of the sleepless night, everyone went to their rooms to rest.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we visited Jinshan Temple. The solemn palaces and the lined-up statues of gods, the giant eyes, the exposed teeth, and the grotesque faces, would make people nervous. Behind the temple, there is a seven-story pagoda. We climbed up the steps and reached the highest level, overlooking the earth as if it were in our grasp. Looking into the distance, Jiao Mountain stood tall in the river, with small boats coming and going in between. At this time, a gentle breeze came, intoxicating people, and unconsciously, our minds were broadened and we had the will to go far and high. We also imitated Confucius and Laozi's tone and recited in a low voice, "Climbing the Jinshan Temple Pagoda and belittling Zhenjiang." Next to the tower, there is a stone pavilion with an inscription that reads "A Panoramic View of the Rivers and Mountains." We took a photo here.</p>
<p>Leaving the temple and turning towards the First Spring Under Heaven, the ancient trees along the road are intertwined and connected into a path. The gentle breeze blows, welcoming people with smiles. Across the bank of the stream, an old fisherman sits leisurely, fishing. This beautiful nature!</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>Ah! The picturesque scenery! You have now cleansed my mind. You will make me forget the troubles of the world and be intoxicated and enjoy being in your embrace.</p>
<p>The fun was not yet over, so we went to Zhenjiang Park. Jiang and Wang, the two of them, are truly admirable. They didn't sleep all night yesterday and still had the courage to run to a distant mountain pavilion to rest. My legs were already a little sore and numb, but they didn't feel tired at all. It was already dusk when we returned to the hotel.</p>
<p>During dinner, the conversation and laughter began again. Mr. Xu, nonsensically, imitated the Shanghai dialect, saying, "This sesame cake is delicious, laixi."</p>
<p>"This bowl of rice is skewed and sweet, lie." He said again with a smile.</p>
<p>"This thing is extremely delicious, jiaoguan youwei," Mr. Wang also followed suit.</p>
<p>"Ah Wang, are we speaking correctly?" She is an old Shanghainese and was asking her for advice.</p>
<p>"You have a few copper coins, have no taste, luo? Meidewei, luo?" Hu also imitated the Hunan dialect that I and my brother spoke, laughing at her.</p>
<p>"You invited me to dinner, did you kill a chicken or did you kill your family?" I also spoke Hubei dialect, laughing at her.</p>
<p>"·········"</p>
<p>One sentence from you and one sentence from me, we finished a meal and our stomachs were full of laughter.</p>
<p>The fatigue from the car ride and the tiredness after sightseeing, not long after dinner, we all drifted off to sleep.</p>
<p>··········</p>
<p>We got up very early the next morning. After a night of sound sleep, our spirits had all returned to their original state. So we bought a boat for a trip to Jiao Mountain. The boat swayed in the middle of the stream, and our spirits also increased. Some stood on the deck, raising their heads to the sky, silently chanting with the sound of the water flowing. Some sat quietly, basking in the sun. Some were browsing the scenery on the river bank. Some were even taking the opportunity to sing. Mr. Xu was singing a Henan folk song. Mr. Huang was playing a Japanese hand harp and singing "Sparrow and Child." Hu also seemed to be sitting at the entrance of the cabin, singing English love songs in a low voice. Mr. Lu also raised his voice and sang his Yixing Beijing opera. Old Wang was even more generous and performed several foxtrots. At this time, we were all indulging in the mountains and rivers. Arriving at Jiao Mountain, we abandoned the boat and landed. Entering Jiao Mountain Temple, several students ran to the main hall to ask for a divination stick. Old Huang said that he was the most unhappy. Both times, it was "down, down." He took off his hat and asked for another divination stick, which was the most auspicious. This way, the gods were also good at flattering. Leaving the temple gate and entering the mountain road, we rested for a while in the pavilion and then went up the towering cliff, following the small path to reach the top of the mountain. With the white sun overhead and the great river flowing eastward, everyone had an indescribable sense of greatness and comfort in their hearts. After lingering for a long time, we returned to the boat by the original route and visited Ganlu Temple again. Troops were stationed in the temple, the buildings were dilapidated, and the scenery was bleak, only for tourists to look back on.</p>
<p>Returning to the hotel, it was not yet four o'clock. With nothing to do, we all read the newspaper to pass the time.</p>
<p>After eating dinner, two or three students each went out to see the lively streets, stroll through the amusement park, buy Zhenjiang specialties, and take a walk in the park. Only Jiang, her nose was pink like a peach, as if she had caught a cold and was afraid of catching a chill, stayed alone in the hotel and did not go out.</p>
<p>At ten o'clock in the evening, we all returned and gathered in a room to discuss many issues regarding hiring more teachers, adding courses, and collecting specimens before going to bed.</p>
<p>On the morning of the third day, we visited Zhenjiang Provincial Middle School. In the reception room, we met a Fudan graduate who was teaching there. Meeting in a foreign land, he was especially courteous in his hospitality, leading us to visit the magnificent dormitories, the clean classrooms, and the complete equipment, all of which demonstrated the spirit of running the school. Walking to the dining hall, he told us that this was a student-run food cooperative. Walking to the back garden, he said,</p>
<p>These trees were planted by students, and this rockery was arranged by students. He also said that because the school is located near Ganlu Temple and built against the city, the terrain is extremely high, overlooking the scenery as if it were under the table. Therefore, the school would like to open up a park in the open space behind the school so that students can visit, look out, and rest during their free time, so as to get some physical and mental cultivation. Finally, he took two photos for us, and we were treated to tea and refreshments, exchanged greetings, and agreed to meet again before saying goodbye and leaving the school.</p>
<p>Leaving Zhenjiang Middle School, some of us went straight to the train station, and some returned to the hotel to pack our luggage. At about three o'clock in the afternoon, we boarded the train and shouted "Returning home!"</p>
