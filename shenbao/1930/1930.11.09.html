<p>軍縮會議之障礙不在會議而在各强國之自身各强國自身之政局有變動外交政策有變動在在皆足影響於軍縮昨日德代表所發憤激之論表面上固爲軍縮而發而實則意不在軍縮也德右黨自選舉獲勝後即盛倡恢復戰前狀態修改凡爾賽和約及變更楊格計劃之論今所以尙未公開宣布者以其提案尙未經國會通過耳奥國選舉而石黨得勢亦必有同樣之主張意國之政府黨報紙亦已屢倡修改和約反對法國主張之論一旦實現則各國必起極大之爭論尙何暇論及軍縮法意間之意見愈去愈遠則海軍談判且不能接近更何論乎軍縮故此問題實爲眞能和平與否之關鍵如果提出於軍縮會議則會議不待討論而立破如不提出軍縮會議而在他方面提出則軍縮會議雖敷衍成功亦將仍歸泡影然則軍縮會議誠空言而已</p>
<p>近來歐洲各國因政局變動而影響於外交政策又因國際間猜疑之心日甚而外交政策愈趨於急進愈不能相諒乃成此岌岌可危之局勢軍縮會議之結果固可不論也</p>

<p>申報全國工商會議特刋第九號</p>
<h3>工商會議第八日</h3>
<p>昨日閉幕　發出宣言</p>
<p>議决組織國際貿易恊會工部聘定籌備員發出通電請發還扣留車輌以後不得再扣</p>
<p>言　論</p>
<h3>工商業之政策　張軼歐</h3>
<p>工商業爲天時地利人和之結晶品換言之則時機地利政策三者缺一不可而尤以政策爲重要有政策則時機地利雖稍遜色亦不難盡量補救無政策則時機地利雖處優勢亦不能充分利用吾國地大物博人民勤樸耐勞以農立國可以工商立國亦無不可而大好時機亦往往有之試一查考大抵毎十年即有一極好之機會（其一）一八九五年馬關訂約外人得在華設廠予吾人以就近仿造之機會此固利少害多然吾國現有之工商業泰半由此觀感習染而成不得不視爲一種機會</p>
<p>（其二）一九零六年美禁華工我抵美貨予吾人以决心提倡國貨之機會以比較有利者也以後民八之五四運動民十四之五卅慘案毎舉一次抵制外貨之幟國貨生産即增進一次追本溯源不得不歸功於一九零五年之首次决心</p>
<p>（其三）一九一四至一九一九年之歐戰期間予吾人以充分發展之機會實爲意外之好機會假令彼時吾國各種基本工業已有相當規模能儘量自行擴充機器及化學材料能自拓展航業及國際匯兌不難轉貧爲富由農業國一躍而爲工商國由銀本位一躍而爲金本位由債務者一躍而爲債權者即爲前人所誤根據異常薄弱然苟能上下一心兼程並進至少亦可增加大量生産使歷來入超變爲出超不料軍政當局適於此時開始積極内爭竟於不知不覺之中將空前機會一筆勾銷小不忍則亂大謀惟有歸之氣數而已</p>
<p>（其四）民國十六年即一九二七年國民政府奠都南京翌年克復北平全國統一總理實業計畫一書風行海内予天下後世以開物成務之南針爲最新美之機會亦爲最偉大之機會歐戰機會人人失去而總理獨運匠心宏此遠謨實業計畫一番成於歐戰甫完之時所謂殷憂啟聖者也吾人今後無侈談政策之必要亦無另定政策之可能惟有心悅誠服竭忠盡智接受總理之遺敎而已</p>
<p>謹按總理計畫蓋以開發交通建設港埠爲經而以創設大廠振興工業爲緯通商惠工包舉靡遺吾人終身求之有不能盡姑以淺短之知識窺測偉大之特點約可歸納爲二</p>
<p>（一）實業計畫之（實業）是民生主義的而非資本主義的故重要事業注重國營以期民生主義普遍實現而免私人資本過度發逹釀成階級之爭</p>
<p>（二）實業計畫之（計畫）是整個的循環的而非隨便的故凡所當爲無不兼籌並顧以免枝枝節節掛一漏萬或本末倒置之弊惟於詳議開發之時必求食於下列四大原則（一）必選最有利之途以吸外資（二）必應國民之所最需要（三）必期抵抗之至少（四）必擇地位之適宜假令歐戰後各交戰國乃至各中立國誠能如總理所期日以六千萬美金或年以二百一十九萬萬美金助我建設不獨吾國可有突飛之進步即各國之失業問題亦必不至突如其來（失業工人日多一日已成世界各國普遍之現象當局無法可想有主張用此失業之工人於建築工程者不知建築工程在文化已達相當程度之國初無過於謹事增華之必要所用資金旣等於擱淺所有人工亦等於虚擲遠不知依照總理計畫直接間接助我開發投資於有利之途用人於有益之事之爲愈也）不幸各國人士志不在此因循觀望迄未了解大好機會殆已逸去吾人雖誠意接受總理計畫之全部而施行之先後規模之大小程功之遲速在事實上恐不能不有多少之變更試以（實業）所一賢而貧之少年總理以爲彼有富戚可以資助故循正途爲之計畫首入大學次出洋留學並實習次於回國時携帶機器創辦極大事業而其親戚乃一勢利小八絕對不肯成人之美則此少年者惟有　家有無量力而行或半工半讀或小本經營以求逐漸逹到目的仍不負總理期望之厚所謂（或利而行之或安而行之或勉强而行之及其成功一也）</p>
<p>民國十七年春工商部孔部長之行政宣言所舉網要凡十六事大旨（以民生主義爲鵠以實業計劃爲程一方維護固有企業一方更圖發展新機一方鞏固國民經濟一方增進勞工福利以勞資互助之精神培養實業之元氣以親善通商之原則增進國際之協作分别緩急次第舉行建設初基（蓋就總理計畫化簡而成吾國工商業之政策旣有總理之實業計畫舉其全又有部長之行政宣言撮其要余何人斯當然述而不作惟就吾國今日之現狀而論竊敢就已經部長化簡之政策更力求簡要期其易行而贅述數義如次</p>
<p>（二）確定保護政策舉凡制定關稅修改商約舉辦内稅擬訂法規處處認定保護政策而幼稚工業之惟一救星對外則不畏强禦對内則不惜犠牲用全力以赴之最好由工商農礦財政鐵道交通外交等部合組一委員會共同研究以免各策其策不能一貫之弊</p>
<p>（二）獎勵民營事業總理主張國營之事業原附有兩條件一有獨占性質不能委諸個人者二工艱費鉅必需利用外資借重客卿者至於可以委諸個人或其較國家經營爲適宜者則明詔吾人（應任個人爲之由國家獎勵而以法律保護之）且謂（今欲利便個人企業之發逹於中國則從來所行之自殺的稅制應即廢止紊亂之貨幣立埯改良而各種官史的障碍必當排去尤須輔之以利便交通現在國營事業旣困於財政未能舉辦孔部長主張最力之基本工商業由九種而减爲五種亦尙未辦一種則對於民營事業當然竭力獎勵除厲行現有之特種工業獎勵法及機製貨物特别稅法外更當擴而大之即本輕利重應歸國營之基本工商業鄙意亦可劃出數種用保息法招商承辦而食有獨占性質之事業則於政府監督之下酌量開放之</p>
<p>（三）對外集中力量對内調和利益吾國工商業之組織大抵規模狹小勢力渙散不能對抗長袖善舞之外商外國重要事業非但全國聯合一致甚至關係各國亦聯合一致喜國自宜仿而行之但行之不得其道易生壟斷兼併之弊而有違反黨義之嫌故一面對外集中力量一面須對内調和利益不許以大凌小有操縱壓迫情事其興利防弊之法可於政府指導之下以各業公約行之</p>
<p>（四）方求勞資調協自有所謂勞工問題以來依旁人挑撥之詞似勞資兩方應該各走極端拚一個你死我活此大感也夫人之相與必如兩人僅一衣或兩男僅一女一得必有一失絕無活動餘地而後成不兩立之局在工業先進國固已漸臻此境吾國則尙有無限天然之利可供勞資兩方共同攫取勞方以技能欠精工具不良之故工作能力遠不如人苟能逐漸改進以增效率工資自可比例增加資方以計劃未妥管理不善之故浪費金錢不知凡幾苟能力求改良以資撙資工資亦自不妨從寛鄙人曾著一勞資與工程之關係）一文即說明此理茲僅贅陳兩義如下</p>
<p>（一）資方必有相當之管理權非有過分之舉黨政不宜干涉所謂（治道去其泰甚者也）營之航海駕駛之權必歸船長若同舟之人或兩岸之人均得隨便干涉必立即發生危險</p>
<p>（二）工資增至相當程度時宜節儲一部分使變成資本鄙人在外國在本國與工人相處頗多且久竊見外國工人之資多耗於酒中國工人之資多耗於賭增加工資與提高生活實屬兩事如能的定成數隨時扣存加入股本則旣可養成節儉之風又可使勞資兩級之關係漸漸親密漸漸融洽當工商部草擬公司法時鄙人有此主張惜乎未之能行</p>
<p>（五）手工業一律獎護一（失業問題）爲工業先進國專用之名詞（失業）者已成業已有業而忽然失去之謂也吾國則大多數人未嘗成業未嘗有業直是（無業）不獨窮鄕僻邑機器工業驟難興辦不能不獎護手工以維生計即在通都大邑亦尙人浮於事求人工廠而不可得者仍賴手工以資糊口東西各國失業人數少者不過數萬多亦不過數十萬或一百萬已視爲極大問題吾國無業之人至少在一萬萬以上豈反可不成問題除土布業經免稅外鄙意對於手工製品之待遇至少須與機製式洋貨物相等方合國情方合時宜</p>
<p>又有兩事可附述於此作爲餘論者</p>
<p>（一）最近輸人之（合理化）依鄙見論之在業尙幼稚人苦無業之國可謂救時良藥而在業已過度人患失業之國則無異火上澆油蓋所謂（合理化）者陳義雖高條理雖密其結果不外省工·省料·省轉折·省中間人如此一省再省直接間接歸根到底所省惟人故在幼稚之國苟能合理化以蓋去浪費則物美價廉外可抵制輸入内可誘導企業無業之人亦可有業業與人均恢恢乎遊刃有餘地然亦不宜持此高調以繩一切因環境關係暫難合理化之小工業或手工業而蔑視之薄待之至在工業已過度發逹之國愈合理化將愈不堪彼資本家徒知省工·省料·省轉折·省中間人可以輕滅成本低廉售價以銷其過剩之貨而不知銷塲究有限制失業之人則必更加多所謂知其一不知其二者也世無不變之學說亦無不壤之制度今之工業制度蓋已逹崩壤之期而學說亦將隨之變遷今後之工業革命必取（有飯大家吃）之主義正當之合理化應合於下列之原則</p>
<p>（一）凡艱苦卑汚之工作非人力所能勝或不合人道者悉用機器并須精益求精能操縱機器之工人不受艱苦卑汚之影響</p>
<p>（二）凡經簡高尙之工作爲人力所能勝而可無碍人道者則機器之使用與合理化之程度當適可而止使人人有工可作否則合理之極一業祇須一廠一邑祇須一店如仍行私産制是少數飽而多數餓也如改用公産制是少數勞而多　逸也質而言之似皆不成世界不成人生也甘地不但服大布之衣且手提舊制之紡機以紡紗吾人如不認爲瘋則其思想舉動有可研究者矣况在吾國機器工業本未發逹窮鄕僻壤惟有手工積少成多亦成大利豈可蔑視之乎</p>
<p>（二）近一年來之金貴賤風潮野人士絞盡腦筋治本治標紛然雜陳而迄無定論尙有待於召集經濟會議徵求全國公意鄙人深知茲事體大差之毫釐失以千里興邦喪邦决於一言向不敢輕李表示意見惟下列二義則有利無害試略述之</p>
<p>（一）廢兩爲元劃一輔幣一律用十進制此即總理所謂（紊亂之幣制立需改良）不如此不成國幣亦不成國家即無金潮亦當如此而廢兩爲元以後對於生銀之出入易於取締則於金潮之救濟亦不無禆益也</p>
<p>（二）盡量增加生産軍閥匪共一律肅淸機貨手工一律獎勵以期輪出激增入超銳减蓋無論金幣銀幣在本國原有法價原是籌碼惟向外流出始視同貨物發生貴賤問題假令吾國對外貿易是出超而非入超則銀雖日賤初無急以換金之必要何至有如是之恐慌至於改用金</p>

<h3>（一）關於抵制經濟侵略者</h3>
<p>總理有言（中國躋於國際平等地位以後國民經濟及一切生産方得充分發展）而廢除不平等條約撤廢領事裁判權及勵行保護關稅實爲發展我國幼稚工業之基本條件此本會議所兢兢致意者一也</p>
<h3>（二）關於聯合經營者</h3>
<p>欲與外國工業相競爭必有大規模之製造與最新式之販賣事作方法而集中資本集中原料集中機器與人力以期節省耗費减輕成本尤爲當務之急最近火柴搪磁諸業已實行聯合經營或聯合販賣以爲節减生産費額抵制外商屯併之計此後絲綢·紗布·茶·　·水泥·桐油·大豆·諸主要工商業亦殆非採取同一方策略不足以應付環境妥籌善後羣策羣力今正其時此本會議所兢兢致意者二也</p>
<h3>（三）關於整理稅制者</h3>
<p>發展生産固當以廢除苛捐雜稅篇前是而刷新商稅制度尤爲根本要圖裁釐之議倡之垂三十年徒以圖家多故軍費浩繁遂致固有釐金迄未裁撤而巧立名目之苛稅尤復變本加厲乃</p>
<p>者我國民政府旣有於二十年一月一日以前裁釐之明令凡我工商界曷勝慶幸此次對本會議之提案請求裁釐及各項苛征者有五十件之多渴望裁撤之興情於此可見所冀政府如期實行以慰國人之渴望此本會議所兢致意者三也</p>
<h3>關於改良幣制者</h3>
<p>改良幣制政府已有方案在最近金貴銀錢之時尤注生於金本位制之確定惟本會議以爲茲事體大必須有充分之準備及適當之步驟爲今之計莫如先就復雜紊亂之現行幣制着手整理爲統一銀元廢兩改元及確定紙幣發行制度然後審度時勢酌景情形逐漸採用金本位制此本會議所兢兢致意者四也</p>
<p>本位時彦議論雖漸趨一致鄙人則尙懹疑蓋吾國改用金幣應在歐戰期内金賤銀貴印度趨南尙未用金之時機會早已失去現在金已貴矣銀已賤矣我又爲唯一用銀之國若亦廢銀銀且益賤國人財産之價値必打一倒三折或倒二折而無疑且金本位制須鑄金幣金匯兌本位制亦須存大宗这金於外國銀行以今日之四海困窮顧安所得金乎英美之用金以有本國或屬地之金礦德日之用金以有法國國中國之賠欵人皆有來源而我獨無如之何而後可然則銀本位可暫時維持乎曰可我之人口在世界上實居四分之一或且過之但能歲平安人人勤奮則國實流通自有天地人皆用金我獨用銀有何不可况幣制學說亦已動搖信用本位制地租本位制萬國複本位制正紛然雜出我又何妨忍之須臾以觀其變乎要之我國地大物博人民衆多苟能振作則頂天立地自成風氣而有餘不能振作則隨波逐流依附草木亦不足凡事皆然幣制特其一例耳</p>

<h3>王正廷演辭</h3>
<p>撤銷領事裁判權發展工商業</p>
<p>王正廷演說謂現當軍事底定之際集全國工商界領袖於一堂此重大會議本人實具有深切感想（一）從前政治與經濟工商關係太淺好像是政治自政治經濟自經濟工商自工商各自爲謀政府又視工商界爲財源苛振重稅甚至以勢力壓迫對於如何造福工商培養工商界元氣注意者甚少在立國要素一政治二經濟三外交而工商界立於三者之間其地位等於電流政治經濟外交三者等於電綫故旣具此密切之關係不得不有切實之聯絡至欲謀工商業之安全先要解决民生尤要於外交上十分注意通商以後國内政治經濟時時與國外政治經濟相接觸以物質文明上相比較不無膛乎其後欲工商業之改良與發展必得中外商業能得平等待遇關稅自主以後等於彼此開槍擊射其最後之勝負即視槍彈能命中與否以爲定是在工商界與政府之共同合作（二）中國領事裁權之未取消有人以爲是政治問題非經濟問題實是錯誤從前外人藉口中國法律未改良不肯取消旣改良矣又藉口中國不太平不肯取消故外人領事裁判權之存在於中國者尙有六七國其實世界任何國家不能有治無亂國内亂事自有國家武力爲之制裁與外人領判權問題實風馬牛之不相及外人不肯放棄此權就是彼自維護其經濟政策保護其在華之商業使在領判權保護下者能於少納稅或不納稅故欲逹到收回目的固在政治與外交上之運用還要全國一致大聯合爲政府後盾誓死力爭才有力量蔣總司令此次戡平叛逆其最大目的就是掃除國内大障礙以抵抗帝國主義之壓迫以實現中國之眞正自由平等云云</p>
<p>會員演說</p>
<h3>胡庶華演說</h3>
<p>大會予人民在政治上發言</p>
<p>大會並非資方會議</p>
<p>希望政府實行决案</p>

<p>（二）外界會此次曾議僅僅會議而已或工商部多些檔案而已但我們大家祇少都是些好國民在此供獻意見希望政府能將此次决議切實實行將來再開第二第三…次工商會議時則工商之發展無察我們的口號是工商會議萬歲</p>

<p>（二）國貨廠商始終無勞資不協作之事資本家辦廠才有勞資糾紛或有工人以外别有作用之工友混雜在内從中搗亂才有工潮發生中國眞正工友能耐勞刻苦愛護國家如無外界之引誘煽惑决不至罷七人係鐵工出身現辦廠有五六處之多故深知工人之實業此次即代表工友而出席工商會議者有人謂工商會議是資方會議本人絕對否認凡做一廠一店之經理者其責任須使勞資兩方各得其平才能實現民生先爲羣衆謀幸福則個人之地位與幸福始能保持如上海國貨商塲開幕三月以來在外貨堆積之大馬路與三大公司猛烈竸爭之結果猶能做得四十餘萬之營業此後仍當繼續維持國貨商塲並希望諸位於各省各巿積極倡設國貨商場逐漸轉移國人被洋貨麻醉之楨習此國貨同人請求諸位二也</p>

<h3>美棉巿猶未樂觀</h3>
<p>糧巿虚弱證劵亦疲</p>
<p>七日紐約電告一週棉巿狀况云十月下半月棉價張起後現貨市場中所發生之反動人氣本週中依然存在五月期貨巿價到一角二分後同業買風逐漸减少惟在價格回落時始復購進以實際言棉價從十月初之低度向上腃起已使棉巿地位爲之鬆動迨同業之購進與空頭之補又漸見淸淡時巿價乃因南方之售賣與多頭之了結而呈疲勢糧巿虚弱證劵亦未轉堅而十一月八日政府棉産報告其内容又尙無把握故扯平買賣之趨勢愈見有力蓋欲待日後之發展也在贸易未有實在起色及棉田未有切實减少以前棉價之漲零能否持久此則不能無疑故多頭人淸現仍爲此種疑念所限制云</p>
<p>双訉近期裝運之國内訉問視前進步但期貨則較不注意一二年期貨尤乏人過問國内鎖費額仍低國内疋頭贸易較堅但成交較少平均意思以爲農部棉産報告約爲一千四百五十萬包云附週末統計如下（單位千包）</p>

<h3>北遊印象</h3>
<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>（二十二）南歸</p>
<p>岡替我辦了一張中東路的免票我懹着這張送我南歸的紙頭走下理事會的高階的時候我感我的身子是如同落葉一樣地無着了</p>
<p>實在雖然有了一紙中東路線的免票而路費仍舊是不能足夠的天幸如果不是靑再給我找了五元日金的話我南歸的日期又將拖延了想起來多們狼狽</p>
<p>天忽然下着雨從會館裏握别了鷗們出來以後靑因爲同時送另外一個友人去北平所以他送我上車站</p>
<p>我將兩件北來時的破舊的行囊送上了車箱唉如今我又得將他們仍舊帶回江南去了</p>
<p>撒稅了靑的手後車身往前蠕動了如今我又要對哈爾濱說了（别了别了）記得離上海時這樣說過不想僅才半年上海又快會與我重見了這原非本來所料到的可是這回對哈爾濱却眞難料何日能再見呢不過像我這們無定蹤的人誠然也不可斷定說在短時期内就没有重來東北的可能記得三年前的秋天因爲學校旅行到無錫一次我曾發誓不再到無錫去了然而事後在一個月裏却又重到無錫去過兩次呢</p>
<p>車内的感覺和來時一樣雖然一次是冬季一次却是初秋（其實在江南還是盛夏呢）經過一夜的巓震後到逹了長春</p>
<p>孤獨地守着兩件行裝坐在候車室裏在思緒裏不知幻化着多少已往現在和未來的回憶希望夢想以至憂慮</p>
<p>在未離上海之先總企想着到北方去的夢幻誰知這正是一塲夢幻一塲孤獨的飄泊者的夢幻非但一切無所獲得或是實行而竟如此怱怱地狼狽地南歸但是接着最大的問題就是南歸後的生活方法雖然我曾大膽地對北方的友人說（夠了我是不願再在北方多逗留一日了讓我回南方去吧……）但回到南方又將怎樣呢這個大而可怖的疑問捉往了我</p>
<p>（唉不回南方去吧南方並没有可以追尋的了朋友們星散着女人們早已忘記了你這流浪的人而且生活總還是絕大的問題呢那末轉回哈爾濱但這决不可能朋友們將會畏懼你這個有神經病的人了好到北平去槐在北平呢也許可以有生活的路……）</p>
<p>然而終于還是買了到大連的車票因爲也許到了大連可以就住下呢不是老楊的信上說過大連有我的飯吃嗎丨咳一個人到現在是只有去找毎天的飯糧了</p>
<p>上了南満車從車窗可以看到往後飛逝的綠野這是與來時的印象不同的</p>
<p>隔我不遠的坐位上有一位日本少婦不知她從那一站上車來的她大概患着歇斯特里不然她也許是一個浪漫派的詩人她獨憑着窗手裏握着一本書連續地她唱歌着並不是唱日本歌而是唱的西洋曲子她全然不畏懼乘客們的注視她她面色憔黄黑髮篷亂着</p>
<p>我整個車中的時間就消度在看這個日本少婦了</p>
<p>夜了車到大連我想也許老楊會來迎我</p>
<p>從車裏走出月台果然老楊和他的新夫人在站上等着呢</p>
<p>雇了一輌馬車我老楊夫婦和我的行李一直載往老楊家裏去</p>
<p>（你南歸的行程就在大連中止吧朋友）老楊對我說</p>
<p>我沉默了一回</p>
<p>（我實在没有法子料定自己的生活呢）</p>
<h3>到嘉興</h3>
<p>— 雲鶴</p>
<p>東方漸漸地透出魚肚白的天空一片白霞還待赤日來染色此時在復社的復旦社會系系友們已經從他們的很和暖的床上爬起來準備出發</p>
<p>可是事情不允許我們非常順利住在校内的同學還在他們的床上做甜密的夢呢領導此次野宴的朋友發覺到這是事實時就分頭去呌他們和她們起來直至六點半的時候纔開始鼓動汽車向北站進行</p>
<p>事實的因又給了我們一個很壤的果當我們到北站以後汽笛已嗚嗚而鳴這明明告訴我們七點鐘的快車已不允許我們上去了和站長交涉的結果是改在九時快車往禾</p>
<p>本來我們這一次的出游並不是純粹的旅行目的是Ｐicnic祇要我們能在一起玩至少也能夠満足我們的慾望的於是火車站的待車室暫時爲我們所占爲游樂之塲了</p>
<p>向寂寞的候車室中現在等時充満了和藹而快樂的空氣一幕幕的活劇也將從此開始</p>
<h3>在烟雨樓的女同學</h3>
<p>一度救濟飢民似地分散餅乾和其他吃的東西之後便分發鮮艷的花給毎個人綴在襟上使毎個人都有笑容浮在眉頭一個人提議毎個人自己介紹一下於是趙君便抄襲成文道</p>
<p>（我乃常山趙子龍是也）而金君却效着西廂上張生的口氣道</p>
<p>（小生姓金名×××月×日×時生尚未娶親」</p>
<p>引得哄堂大笑</p>
<p>這次同行的共敎授兩位男朋友二十七位小姐九位</p>
<p>時間已經八點半了我們就紛紛上車三十八位排列在車廂的兩旁活潑得像小鷄一樣</p>
<p>爲着要免除途中的寂寞小玩意兒開始了用花的顔色把同學們分爲六組毎組間要互相問答一次</p>
<p>（應先生你多大年紀了）一個同學問</p>
<p>（三十四）我們底主任回答</p>
<p>（應師母呢）</p>
<p>（唔大一歲）全塲笑起來</p>
<p>在另一組中</p>
<p>（阿林你結婚過没有）</p>
<p>（結婚過了而且有兩個孩子）</p>
<p>（尊夫人的名字呢）</p>
<p>（她呌黄菊華）大家笑彎了腰</p>
<p>車過梵王渡蕭遠先生指點他底母</p>
<p>校約翰大學說許多故事給我們聽他回復到少年憧憬中去了他用豪放的語氣說</p>
<p>（那裏樹木蔭掩的地方是足球塲我是球戲時的ＣheerLeader)</p>
<p>（那裏紅樓一角的地方是聖瑪利亞女學我是常去尋人的）</p>
<p>（尋誰）一個同學問</p>
<p>（尋尋ＭySistel）語氣中露出馬脚掌聲雷動</p>
<p>時光在歡笑中最容易過去十一點半已到嘉興天不做美雨瀟瀟地落下來了</p>
<p>進了一家館子呌燕樂園我們覺得有些飢了於是就據桌大嚼餐中某君提議每人說一句話而且是關於自己缺陷的話有的說（我缺一隻牙）有的說（我是近視眼）其中最沈重的要算這兩句了</p>
<p>（我老了）某女同學</p>
<p>（我嗎見了女人寒冷得很）另一位男朋友</p>
<p>人們都有他自己的追憶也都有自己感傷的對象人生誰也不在缺陷中過去的哩</p>
<p>餐後買舟游烟雨樓外望烟水迷惘遠樹與漁舟隠約可見在古代風光中我們是晝中的詩人了</p>
<p>没有言語没有歌唱在晝欄長廊上徘徊毎人心緒中都圍着満天烟雨似乎在憑吊這老的樓臺</p>
<p>蕭先生詩興勃發在紙上寫着</p>
<p>（山痕波影接湖平烟雨凄迷見古城修到鴛鴦（註）雙不得儂今直欲問來生……）</p>
<p>蕭先生說（我不再接下去了）這詩句中藴藏着他不願說的一件往事</p>
<p>小舟飄往落帆亭在由烟雨樓到落帆亭的水途中可以領略到你所仰慕的嘉興名産的確這也很能消遣你旅途的寂寞</p>
<p>到落帆亭老樹如龍掩覆着斷陵殘闕梧桐細雨點點滴滴</p>
<p>李白堂前蕭先生提議向醉翁行禮蕭先生是愛熱閙的他帶着満腹詩酒到人間來尋熱閙無怪他要對謫仙禮讚</p>
<p>四時許參觀秀州中學在會客至中知道該校成立了已有三十多年了聽說是敎會設立的校長先生很殷勤的領導我們參觀宿舍的整潔圖書館内肅靜無聲不禁使我回想到昔日的生活和今日的浪漫</p>
<p>七點鐘搭車歸來一條火龍於雨絲風片中穿破了黑暗又帶進到大都巿的宮庭來了</p>
<p>我們歸來了我們祇覺得快樂歡欣</p>
<p>未了還說道嘉興這江南的老城能使我們聯想到明淸小說中所述的風光英雄的莊歌美人的曼舞似乎都在瓊樓玉宇中搖成一片</p>
<p>雨中的嘉興確留印於我人之腦筋中永遠不忘的迷惘</p>
<p>註（煙雨樓所在地名南湖又名鴛鴦湖）</p>

<h3>忘記帶了錢沈東美</h3>
<p>她的新生活開始了她得了一個朋友的援助束裝到上海進　中學求學</p>
<p>這幾天她並不感到困乏繳了膳宿費以外還餘一張十元的花綠紙頭因此她在最短的時期裏能表現出富貴闊綽的塲面在許多女同學的面前她們一無經騐的心靈中都以爲她是一個富有的女子</p>
<p>（我在上海雖然不算富有但在敝鎭上已經算獨一無二了我的祖父遺下來有田四千畝巿房很多在敝鎭上一半的房屋都是我們的還開了十二所店每到年終收到的租米房金利息眞不知有多少呢我在家裏是很舒服的現在帮匪是這樣地多所以我不敢着綢緞的衣服戴貴重的珍寶雖然這些東西我家裏是很多的）她常常拿這幾句話去告訴全校的同學眞的同學都相信她的話</p>
<p>但這區區的十塊錢是很容易用完的在完全用盡的一天她就感到煩悶了然而不久她想到了一個很好方法</p>
<p>啊呀我出來太匆促了竟忘帶了錢現在所用的還是在我不知那時放在袋裏而偶然找到的雖然我已寫信至家向家裏索取但這幾天使我如何的苦悶呀像我這樣用慣的人）</p>
<p>（這有什麽要緊呢我有着幾十塊錢可以借給你用好在你家裏把銀錢寄來是很迅速而且很容易的事）毎個同學都這樣說</p>
<p>（這是難爲情的吧我從來没有借過錢）</p>
<p>（哈哈你眞是一個富貴的小姐暫借有什麽難爲情呢的確在富貴小姐的眼中看來道借錢是很可恥的）毎個同學都以爲把錢借給一個富貴小姐是很榮幸的事</p>
<p>她於是感到快樂了結果竟借到了二三百塊錢在各同學中</p>
<p>這是一件奇怪的事她的衣服都換了新的了</p>
<p>光陰是過得很快的過了一個月她的錢總於没有寄來</p>
<p>在一天的下午她坐在臥室裏的床上默想着默想着這幾天同學們都在疑心她她恐怕恐怕這紙老虎要觸破了好像不幸的事情即刻將要光臨到她的身上</p>
<p>（有人找你在會客室裏）她忽然被這淸脆的聲音驚破了她的呆想但她不知道找她的是誰</p>
<p>她慢慢的跑到會客室裏（啊）她發出驚奇的羞愧的呼聲</p>
<p>（啊呀銀弟呀我去年因爲你要做件短衫把我的幾個脚爐當了現在啊現在已經期満没了怎樣呢今年冬天將怎樣禦寒呢像我這樣的年老我的兒呀你總要替我想想法呀因爲當這脚爐是爲你）一個衣衫破舊的老太婆一見了她帶器的說着</p>
<p>她眼前一片鳥黑四週的空氣裏充満着譏諷的聲音</p>

<h3>Anlu Cotton Mill Autumn Sale Extended for Ten Days Starting Today</h3>
<p>Our mill's renowned and branded cotton textiles are of excellent quality and comprehensive preparation, essential for daily life. Cotton quilts and cotton wadding are particularly indispensable in recent days. Because of the enthusiastic patronage of our countrymen during the sale period, and because of the continuous autumn rains lately, we are deeply concerned that some may not have had the opportunity to purchase them and may regret it. Therefore, we are extending the sale for ten days so that gentlemen and ladies from all walks of life who have not yet purchased winter supplies can buy them as soon as possible, hoping to achieve widespread availability.</p>
<p>Hygienic Shirts and Trousers, Wholeheartedly Made Vests, All-Wool Shirts, Gloves, Scarves, and other winter supplies are adequately prepared with a complete range of styles. Please come and choose immediately.</p>

<h3>Dianguang Society's Announcement to First-Term Members</h3>
<p>Respectfully informing that the first-term membership certificates issued by our society are valid from August 1, the 18th year (of the Republic), to July 31 of this year, a period of one year. For the entertainment of members, one beauty picture is given away with each membership certificate. However, the towels that first-term members should exchange have not yet been fully exchanged, and the enthusiasm of new second-term members to join is exceptionally high. In order to clearly delineate the boundaries, our society intends to expedite the second-term procedures after all first-term towels have been exchanged. We solemnly declare that any first-term member whose towel has not been exchanged, regardless of whether they joined midway, should bring their membership certificate and stamp and exchange it at the industry as soon as possible before the end of this year, lest they miss the opportunity. The new regulations for the second term will be announced separately. This is a combined announcement.</p>

<h3>Zhang Hepin Ginseng, Bird's Nest, and National Medicine Store at the Intersection of Xinjazhalu and East Matt Hess Road, Shanghai, Officially Opens on November 10th of the Gregorian Calendar</h3>
<p>Because the owner of this store recognizes the prosperity of the Xinzha area of the concession, the vastness of the urban area, the wealth of the residents, and the increasing population, yet there is a lack of a well-managed, large-scale Chinese pharmacy, which is a great deficiency. Therefore, for the convenience of the public, we spared no expense to build a four-bay clear water brick, tall Shikumen facade, magnificent architecture, and luxurious decoration. A preparatory office was established in Yongdingli, Shanhai Road, for three years. For decoction pieces, pill preparations, powders, ointments, jellies, and medicinal wines, we all follow ancient methods and have already set everything up completely. Ginseng, bird's nest, and tonics are available in abundance, and the important medicinal specialties are displayed separately for research. The winter season is perfect for nourishment, and it is also the beginning of the opening. All ginseng, bird's nest, deer velvet, immortal jelly, and tonics are sold at a sacrifice of cost for one month as a courtesy to customers. Your presence is most welcome.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Fanerdeng Chemical Research Society's Announcement of Gift Voucher Distribution</h3>

Since the announcement in the newspaper, we have been overwhelmed with welcome for five months.

Detailed regulations are printed on the back of the voucher. The gifts will be distributed on the 15th of each month, rain or shine, to show great faith. The fifth set will be given away on the 15th of this month, with only seven days left. There are not many gift vouchers remaining, so buyers should hurry. Such an opportunity is rare to come across again. This is a special announcement.</p>

<h3>Announcement by the Savings Department of Dalu Bank</h3>
<p>This bank has been approved by the government to concurrently handle various savings businesses and has a special savings department to handle various long-term and short-term savings for many years. It has long been trusted by all walks of life. Because savings deposits are increasing day by day, we have added additional funds and listed the main points of the method as follows: (1) Separate Deposits and Withdrawals (2) Independent Accounting (3) The Balance Sheet of Assets and Liabilities Will Be Announced Once a Year in the Annual Statement (4) Specializing in Mortgage Loans and Reliable Securities in Accordance with Regulations (5) The Interest Rate Is Better Than Ordinary Deposits (6) The Directors, General Manager, Vice President All Bear Unlimited Liability The above provisions are for the purpose of implementing the bank's prudent policy and protecting the interests of depositors. This is a special announcement.</p>
<h3>A Thousand Emptinesses, One Reality</h3>
<p>There is a saying: A thousand emptinesses cannot match one reality. What is meant by emptiness is empty thoughts. What is meant by reality is using one's own strength to truly put it into practice. Everyone desires progress in life, but ultimately cannot achieve it because of empty thoughts. Saving money every month, so that you can get a percentage of income when the term expires, and have a chance to win a prize every month, is because of putting it into practice. Therefore, the depositors in our association are all people of action, and our association also adheres to this principle of action, doing everything in accordance with the articles of association, without any falsehoods. As a result, the association's affairs are progressing day by day. Now, the total number of depositors has exceeded 100,000. The special prize of 50,000 yuan has been extended from one to two. There are 52 prizes each for first, second, third, and fourth prizes. These are all the results of action, not something that can be achieved by empty thoughts. People of action who hope for economic progress should quickly join the association. This announcement is for details. Inquiries by letter will be promptly provided.</p>

<h3>Solicitation of Propaganda Works by the Literacy Movement Propaganda Committee of Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>Our committee now needs to select materials such as scripts and lyrics for propaganda purposes. If writers from home and abroad are willing to contribute their outstanding works, we would be extremely grateful! The deadline for submissions is December 10th, the 19th year (of the Republic). Application forms can be obtained by writing to the Education Department of Zhejiang Province in Hangzhou or to this committee.</p>
<p>Respectfully announced by the Literacy Movement Propaganda Committee of Zhejiang Province</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Announces Postponement of National Anthem Collection</h3>
<p>The Ministry previously formulated measures to solicit a national anthem for our country and widely solicited submissions. Now that the solicitation period has ended, the National Anthem Review Committee has been organized to conduct a preliminary review of the submissions. It is believed that there are indeed people who have attempted to follow the solicitation standards. However, the general works have many shortcomings: [1. The text is not simple and easy to understand, and cannot be understood by those receiving compulsory education and remedial education; 2. The lyrics exceed 150 words, making them difficult to memorize; 3. The tone cannot be uplifting, and there are not many who use the rhymes of "丫", "　", "　", "　", etc.; 4. The meaning of the words contains temporality, such as 400 million people, more than 4,000 years of culture, etc., which are not suitable for permanent use; 5. The wording is too exaggerated]. It is appropriate to extend the solicitation period and revise the previously promulgated solicitation measures in order to obtain the most perfect national anthem. In addition to revising the previously set solicitation measures separately and issuing and announcing the solicitation, we hope that people from all over the country will actively respond and send them directly to the Social Education Department of the Ministry by the end of December of this year! The revised solicitation measures are as follows. Revised Measures for Soliciting National Anthem Lyrics 1. Standards for soliciting national anthems: (1) The lyrics must be able to express national characteristics and common ideals. In order to arouse patriotism, national consciousness, and promote the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, so that the people know where to go. (2) The lyrics must be simple and easy to understand, with a profound rhyme, so that people across the country, men, women, old, young, can recite them easily and spread them easily. (3) The lyrics must be sonorous and uplifting, so that the people feel happy and encouraged when singing. 2. Applicants must write the lyrics clearly before the end of December of the 19th year (of the Republic), and indicate the name of the songwriter and the detailed address, and send them to the Social Education Department of the Ministry of Education for collection. It would be even more welcome if you could send the music score together. 3. After the national anthem manuscripts are collected, the Ministry of Education will hire party and state scholars to evaluate them first, and the results will be announced in February of the 20th year (of the Republic). 4. The winner will be awarded 1,000 yuan by the Ministry of Education, regardless of the recipient's listening, but must declare in advance when applying.</p>

<h3>Notice from the National Conference on Weights and Measures to All Members</h3>
<p>This association mistakenly scheduled the meeting to be held in the auditorium of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in the capital from November 10th to 15th. All members are requested to report to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in advance. In addition to separate notification of the daily meeting time and agenda, this notice is given in advance, hoping that you will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Announcement from the Central Military Academy</h3>
<p>It has been found that the advanced class of this school has been ordered to restore all new recruit training offices and should return to school. The students of the industry have not yet sent the accurate number and detailed list to the school, and there is no way to handle it. I am afraid that the extension will be delayed and the students' studies will be delayed. In addition to sending a letter to urge them again, the school will first publish a notice. All students who have not opened a school place in the previous advanced class of this school should return to the school, regardless of whether their current position has been removed or not, and are limited to come to the school from November 1st to 10th to register first, so that they can be counted into the number and compiled. Budget please send the payment overnight and prepare to wait for the scheduled assembly and formation to start school. Late registration will not be recorded. All students who return to school for study will be subsidized after the budget is determined and will still be handled by the school and distributed separately after the assembly. This is a special distribution.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on the Military Disarmament Preparatory Committee</h3>
<p>The obstacle to the disarmament conference lies not in the conference itself, but in the powerful nations themselves. Changes in the political situation of each powerful nation and changes in their foreign policy are all sufficient to affect disarmament. Yesterday, the German representative made an impassioned speech, ostensibly for disarmament, but in reality, his intention was not disarmament. Since the right-wing party in Germany won the election, it has been advocating restoring the pre-war state, revising the Treaty of Versailles, and changing the Young Plan. The reason why it has not yet been publicly announced is that its proposal has not yet been passed by the parliament. The election in Austria and the rise of the Stone Party will also have the same demands. The government party newspapers in Italy have also repeatedly advocated revising the treaty and opposing France's proposals. Once realized, there will inevitably be great disputes among the countries, so what time is there to discuss disarmament? As the gap between France and Italy widens, naval negotiations cannot even get close, let alone disarmament. Therefore, this issue is truly the key to whether there can be peace. If it is raised at the disarmament conference, the conference will collapse before discussions even begin. If it is not raised at the disarmament conference but raised in other areas, the disarmament conference, even if it succeeds in a superficial way, will still be in vain. Therefore, the disarmament conference is truly empty talk.</p>
<p>Recently, due to political changes in various European countries, foreign policy has been affected. Furthermore, due to the increasing suspicion among countries, foreign policy has become increasingly radical and less able to understand each other, leading to this precarious situation. The outcome of the disarmament conference can certainly be disregarded.</p>

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams Military Disarmament Preparatory Committee</p>
<h3>Holding Secret Meetings</h3>
<p>No Results from Discussions on Naval Limitations</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 7th - This morning, representatives attended the preparatory committee for disarmament. In the afternoon, the chief delegates held a secret meeting to consider whether naval restrictions should be imposed on the total number or on a categorized basis. After lengthy discussions, no results were achieved. Therefore, this issue is temporarily shelved and will be discussed again after representatives from certain countries receive instructions from their governments.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 7th - Today, the preparatory committee for disarmament discussed whether, in future agreements, naval personnel should be counted separately for officers and enlisted men, or combined. The United States, Britain, and Japan all advocated for a combined count, while France and Russia claimed that separate counts would better reflect real military strength. After three hours of debate, it was decided to refer the matter to a subcommittee to seek a compromise. Subsequently, German representative Count Bernstorff spoke, stating that this was another opportunity for the committee to limit the training of reserve forces to demonstrate a commitment to reducing military quotas and armaments. He argued that both naval and land forces should have their total numbers divided into active and reserve periods, and that the number of annual conscripts should be determined. Those who have completed their reserve period should be listed separately and no longer conscripted. After discussion, the German representative strongly demanded a vote, but Chairman Loudon refused and adjourned the meeting, announcing that discussions would continue tomorrow.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 7th - French newspapers have expressed a somewhat alarmed tone regarding the preparatory committee for disarmament. Le Petit Parisien believes that a satisfactory agreement can be drafted in as little as six weeks. The Soviet Union will certainly oppose this agreement, and Germany will vehemently attack it, but at least twenty-five countries should accept it. Left-wing newspapers only detail the speeches of the German and Russian representatives, but the demand by Litvinov for a 50% reduction in all armaments is also essentially a non-starter. The nationalist newspaper L'Echo de Paris seized the opportunity to launch a fierce attack on Germany, saying that the Germans were hoping for the failure of the conference so they could use it as an excuse to increase their military strength to match France.</p>

<p>British Shipley By-Election</p>
<h3>Public Sentiment Leans Towards the Conservative Party</h3>
<p>Another Loss for the Labour Party</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th - A by-election was held in the Shipley constituency of the United Kingdom due to the death of the former Labour Member of Parliament, Major Greenwood. As a result, Lock-wood of the Conservative Party won with 15,238 votes. Labour's Robinson received 1,665 fewer votes. The electors of Shipley rely on the wool textile industry for their livelihood. The Conservative Party gained votes by promoting two major issues: unemployment and protecting the wool industry, by increasing tariffs to counteract the need for foreign wool textiles. After winning the election, Lockwood told people that the current measures to alleviate unemployment can be implemented immediately by the Conservative Party, and that the steady and pragmatic people of Yorkshire now know that only the Conservative Party can save them. There are 6,000 more female voters than male voters in the Shipley constituency. Women are more active in elections, while men are less enthusiastic. In the previous election, Labour's Major Greenwood received 18,654 votes. The main reason why the Labour Party could not retain its seat this time is the long-standing problem of unemployment.</p>
<p>British Airship Disaster Case</p>
<h3>Investigation Continues</h3>
<p>Two Important Documents Discovered</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th - The inquiry into the British airship R101 disaster reopened today. Two French aviation experts testified that, to their knowledge, no part of the airship was damaged and the engines were working properly before it hit the ground. Two documents discovered by the inquiry today are the most noteworthy aspects of the case. One is a letter from the airship's designer, Richmond, to Scott on September 2, stating that the airship was overweight, that holes in the gasbags could lose the airship's lifting power within twelve hours, and that a hole one foot square would reduce the lifting power by one ton, so it was necessary to prevent holes. The other is a report from Inspector MacWade stating that there was friction between the gasbags and screws, and that if this was not corrected, he could not advocate reissuing a flight license. Chairman Sir Simon asked witness MacWade if he could issue a certificate that the airship was airworthy, given that he knew the condition of the airship. MacWade replied that he was afraid he could not.</p>

<p>The Capital Railway Ferry Will Begin Construction</p>
<h3>Total Construction Cost of 4 Million</h3>
<p>Can Be Completed in About One Year</p>
<p>The Yangtze River between Xiaguan and Pukou prevents vehicles from the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou railways from directly traversing. The journey is time-consuming and costly for passengers and goods due to the unloading and reloading. The transportation sector has long recognized this problem, and plans for a railway ferry have been widely discussed throughout the country. In the past, the Ministry of Transportation in Peiping sent Chinese and foreign engineering experts abroad for inspection. Upon their return, they made numerous suggestions, including constructing a floating bridge, raising and lowering the ship's surface, constructing a water gate and injecting water to make it rise and fall, or constructing a fixed ramp with a movable gangway. However, the above-mentioned styles were all examples of previous plans in various countries, and they were mostly unsuitable if adopted as is. Furthermore, the construction costs were too high. Moreover, the water level of the Yangtze River fluctuates by twenty-four feet, making it difficult to find the most appropriate and economical plan. Therefore, it has not been realized for more than ten years. At the beginning of the establishment of the Ministry of Railways, this ferry was given great attention because it was related to the transportation of the capital. Zheng Hua, the dean of the Tangshan Civil Engineering College of Jiaotong University, had previously proposed a ferry plan and had a clear idea and well-prepared plan, which would achieve twice the result with half the effort. He was specially transferred to the ministry to serve as the chief of the design section. After Mr. Zheng arrived at the ministry, he led the staff of the section, Wu Qiyou, Huang Yuyu, Wang Juju, Mao Qimei, and Fu Qiang, to carefully study and prepare a detailed plan. The ministry also assigned Director Sa Fujun, Technical Supervisor Yan Deqing, Assistant Huang Zhensheng, Technical Zheng Hua, Lu Weipu, Jin Tao, Director Wang Jinzhi and Wang Chengzhu of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, Chief Engineer Tasfu, Director Wu Yiming of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau, Engineer Hana, and engineering experts Kendall and Cheng Xiaogang to conduct a detailed review and discuss it several times. They considered it appropriate to proceed according to the plan. The design includes a ferry boat 360 feet long and 58 feet wide, with a speed of 12 nautical miles per hour. The ship is laid with three tracks, each 300 feet long, which can accommodate 21 forty-ton freight cars or 12 of the longest cars. It is also equipped with a locomotive to be stationed on the ship to pull the cars on board and push them off on land to avoid the danger of the cars uncoupling. As for the equipment on both banks, an active bridge will be built on each side, each with four frames, each 150 feet long. Electric elevators are placed on the bridge piers to raise and lower the position of the bridge to suit the water level, so that even if the water level differs by twenty-four feet, the steepest slope will not exceed 2%. A gate is set on the shore, which is opened and closed by electricity. When the ferry docks, the gate opens automatically. An insurance switch is set in front of the gate to interlock with the signal, which can avoid negligence. It is estimated that the total construction cost will be about 4 million yuan. After completion, the crossing time will only take 40 to 50 minutes. Compared with the current situation where all goods have to leave the train and leave the station, board the ship, cross the river, enter the station, and board the train, the time saved is more than just the consumption of unloading fees. It is estimated that the daily cargo volume is about 30 tons, and the freight rate is charged at 1 to 2 yuan per ton. The annual income reaches 1.5 million yuan. The annual operating expenses of the ferry are about 300,000 yuan, and the annual net profit is about 1 million yuan, so the principal and interest can be paid off within four years. It is planned to start construction of the bridge foundation during the shallow water season this winter, and the traffic can be opened in the winter of next year or the spring of the year after that.</p>
<p>The Gan Army Recaptures Qingjiang and Xingan</p>
<h3>The Communist Bandits Retreat to Xinyu and Xiajiang</h3>
<p>The 18th Division Headquarters Enters Qingjiang</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The General Office for Suppressing Communists in Jiangxi originally planned to launch a general offensive on the 1st. However, because the entire line was not yet fully deployed, it was changed to the 5th. The current First Column, the Zhang and Xu Divisions, are advancing along the Qingjiang-Xingan line; the Second Column, the Tan Daoyuan and Liu Yi units, are advancing along the Gao'an line; and the Third Column is advancing along the line west of Gao'an Shanggao. Battles have occurred in the Huibu Shuikou area southwest of Gao'an Qingjiang. The Communist bandits lack ammunition and retreat after a brief resistance. In order to encourage the morale of the army and clarify rewards and punishments, Lu (surname of commander) has specially instructed the subordinate units: (The Communist bandits have caused trouble and困扰our people for a long time. Now the army is dispatched to suppress them. All units and officers at all levels must supervise the soldiers to uphold the spirit of great fearlessness to wipe out these evil Communist bandits. Those who can bravely kill bandits and make outstanding contributions</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>will be reported to the central government for awards. Those who fear and retreat or retreat without authorization will be punished in accordance with the joint responsibility law, and will not be lenient. Please forward these instructions to your subordinates and comply with them.) (And issue military orders: If the squad leader does not retreat and all the soldiers of the squad retreat first, causing the squad leader to be killed in action, all the soldiers of the squad will be killed. The same principle applies to the company, battalion, regiment, and division.)</p>
<p>The Zhu Yaohua Brigade of the 18th Division recaptured Xingan in the middle section of the Gan River on the 4th. The Dai Yue Brigade also recaptured Qingjiang, where the Yuan River and Gan River meet, on the same day. Peng Dehuai, Huang Gonglue and Zhu De retreated southwest towards Xinyu and Xiajiang. Lu received a telegram of victory from Commander Zhang of the First Column yesterday: (According to Brigade Commander Zhu Yaohua's report from Yi Zhenxiang, commander of the 团 at Xingan, the forward troops of the brigade arrived at Xingan at You hour (5-7pm). There were still dozens of bandits in the county who did not have time to escape and were all captured. On the 5th, the brigade led the Yu团to Xingan and immediately marched south to suppress the bandits. The Dai Brigade arrived at Yuejiadu and has sent a team to take over Qingjiang. Details of Qingjiang will be reported later.) The headquarters of the commander of the 18th Division entered Qingjiang from Zhangshu on the 5th. The headquarters of the 54th Brigade entered Xingan County. The headquarters of the 20th Division also advanced from Fengcheng to Zhangshu.</p>
<p>The provincial government has issued a proclamation to encourage the people of the entire province to rise up and eradicate the communists, and is planning to set aside funds to be distributed as administrative expenses for the recaptured counties and to handle post-war affairs. Wang Yinxi, the head of the Department of Civil Affairs, has drafted plans to exempt Communist-controlled areas from Dingliang (a land tax and poll tax), reorganize the police force throughout the province, and provide disaster relief to the victims. These plans were submitted to the provincial affairs meeting for approval and he plans to personally go to the newly recaptured counties to comfort everyone. (November 6)</p>
<p>Hunan Rehabilitation Committee</p>
<h3>Requests Commander-in-Chief Chiang to Personally Suppress the Communist Bandits</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The Communist bandits have spread between Hunan and Jiangxi, attacking government forces and repeatedly capturing cities and towns. In less than four years, the local area has been devastated. Now that the central government has completed the suppression of the rebellion, it has dispatched sixteen divisions and eight independent brigades stationed in the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian to conduct a large-scale encirclement and suppression. However, due to the large number of troops, the vast scope, and the extremely important relationship of unified command, the Hunan Rehabilitation Committee advocated for a telegram to request Commander-in-Chief Chiang to personally supervise the suppression, and also telegraphed civil groups in the provinces of Hubei and Jiangxi to urge them to do the same. The following is the telegram from the Rehabilitation Committee to Chiang: (The evil Communist bandits are funded by the Third International. On a small scale, they overthrow several provinces. On a large scale, they disturb China. All of their plans and deep-seated toxins are more harmful and difficult to eliminate than those of Yan Xishan, Feng Yuxiang, and other rebels. The disasters are hidden and growing day by day, which ordinary people overlook and wise people worry about. Our committee believes that to eliminate the great evil, we must wait for an extraordinary person. The Communists have taken advantage of Your Excellency's victory in suppressing the rebellion and have mustered a heroic army to correct the long-standing abuses in suppressing the Communists. Even if there is a plan for encirclement and annihilation, there is no hope of realizing it. How can we pacify the south and consolidate the foundation of the country? The people of Hunan are in dire straits and do not know where to die. We dare not avoid overstepping our bounds and offer our humble opinions. We beg you to make a decisive decision and come to the front line. Your divine power will be swiftly exerted and the opportunity will be seized. The extraordinary achievements can be achieved immediately. Otherwise, I am afraid that although the situation of stones and eggs is different, the outcome of victory and defeat will eventually be reversed. Even if there are many troops and there is no fear of defeat, success will take time, and many innocent people will be sacrificed in the dried fish shop. Hunan, as a bandit's lair, will soon have no people left. The telegram is alarming. Please consider and accept. Hunan Rehabilitation Committee bows respectfully.) (November 6)</p>
<p>Guangdong Province Strictly Prohibits Discrimination Against Haoyin Coins</p>
<h3>All Official and Civil Transactions Should Be Based on the Official Standard and Full-Colored Coins</h3>
<p>No New, Used, Selected, or New-Old Coins Are Allowed</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: In addition to the Datyang coins used in the Dongjiang, Chaoshan, and Nanlu Qiongzhou areas of Guangdong Province, the remaining areas use the Haoyang coins as the standard. However, since the issuance of newly minted Haobi coins in the 18th year, the provincial capital and affiliated counties have welcomed the new coins and discriminated against the old coins, while the rural counties still use the old coins and refuse to use the new coins. As a result, there was obstruction in trade between the province and the countryside. This year, in order to reorganize the Bank of China, the financial authorities successively recovered and destroyed the old banknotes issued by the bank by cutting off the corners. However, they were still worried that the circulation of funds in the market would not be sufficient, so they ordered the mint to continue casting coins. As a result, unscrupulous merchants divided the new coins into "original new," "selected new," and "picked new," and took advantage of the low discounts to profit from them. As a result, the same kind of currency had three market prices, and there were many abuses in commercial transactions. Recently, in order to maintain financial stability, the Department of Finance has twice summoned the guild merchants of the province's silver industry to discuss and take measures to ban the practice of creating names. Yesterday, it also ordered the counties to strictly comply from November 1st, otherwise they will be punished for disrupting financial stability. The original order stated: "1. It is verified that the currencies commonly used in this province, except for the Datyang coins used in the Chaozhou, Meizhou, Qiongzhou, Yai and Lianzhou areas, are all Haoyang coins. All official and civil tax payments and market transactions in the areas where Haoyang coins are used shall be based on the silver Haoyang coins. The so-called silver Haoyang coins refer to the official standard and full-colored silver coins cast in this province. It is not allowed to distinguish between different types of official standard and full-colored coins, and it is not allowed for either party to insist on a certain type as the transaction standard, resulting in other types of being discounted or undervalued. Anyone who deliberately distinguishes them in order to seek private gain, whether in official or civil transactions, will be guilty of disrupting financial stability. 2. It is found that there are three types of official standard and full-colored silver coins in the Guangzhou market: "original new," "selected new," and "new-old coins." When paying or receiving silver coins, it is even stated that "selected new" is the transaction standard, resulting in the "original new" coins being overvalued and the "selected new" and "new-old coins" being undervalued. As a result, merchants who use silver coins in the market must either compensate for the overvaluation of the receiving party or refuse to use the "selected new" and "new-old coins" and demand "original new" coins. As a result, even petty traders and citizens suffer from this hardship. Recently, the Bank of China uses "selected new" coins for cash redemption, and the merchants claim that the banknotes for cash redemption represent "selected new" coins, and that the "original new" coins should be undervalued by a certain amount. When paying or receiving banknotes, the paying party does not agree to compensate for the overvaluation, and the receiving party refuses to accept the banknotes and demands "original new" coins. Such a situation not only disrupts financial stability, but also devalues the legal tender. The reason for this is that the merchants deliberately classify the official standard and full-colored silver coins into three types and insist on using "selected new" coins as the transaction standard. The abuses have reached this point and should be strictly prohibited. It is hereby decided that from November 1st, the silver industry in this city shall not be allowed to have different names such as "original new," "selected new," and "new-old coins," and shall not be allowed to have different market prices for "original new" coins being overvalued and "selected new" and "new-old coins" being undervalued. After this ban, all official and civil tax payments and market transactions that use silver coins must use the official standard and full-colored silver coins cast in this province, and must not classify and demand to pay or receive a certain type of silver coin among the official standard and full-colored silver coins. Anyone who commits such acts will be prosecuted for disrupting financial stability if they are reported or discovered. In addition to separately issuing circulars, we hereby order you to comply with this order and instruct your subordinates to comply with it as well." (November 1)</p>
<p>Chaoshan Road Destroys Communist Party Organs</p>
<h3>Capture of Eight Members of a Bogus Provincial and Municipal Party Committee</h3>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: After Xiang Hanping's troops conducted searches and suppression of the Communist Party in Chaozhou and Meizhou, the major forces have been gradually annihilated. On the 31st of last month, Commander Xiang summoned group leaders and above at the Shantou Division headquarters to discuss fundamental measures to eradicate the Communist Party. Although the main forces of local Communists have been eliminated, there are still many Communist elements secretly lurking. Recently, an important organ of the party was uncovered near the Guanqiao Nest on the Chaozhou-Shantou Railway. It happened that on the 30th of last month, Zhuang Le, the captain of the Shantou Public Security Bureau's detective team, received a tip-off that some Communists had secretly come to Shantou to establish a general organ for plotting disturbances in Dongjiang. He immediately dispatched detective Luo Wen to the Guangtailai Inn on Ping Road for investigation. Luo found a lodger named Wu Xiguo, whose behavior was suspicious. Luo then falsely claimed to be a comrade sent by the provincial committee to inspect Shantou. He addressed Wu as "Old Comrade," which Wu believed implicitly. They went to a tea house for refreshments and chatted and laughed freely. Then, they went together to the front of the Public Security Bureau on Waima Road. Luo gave a secret signal, and Wu Xiguo was immediately captured and taken to the bureau for interrogation. According to Wu Xiguo's confession, he was supposed to go to Chaoan today with two other comrades for a meeting, and the two were waiting at the Shantou parking lot. The Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched eight detectives to the station and captured the two accomplices, Huang Maoquan and Lin Xianghu, who were tied up and taken back by car. Lin and others then confessed that the general organ of the Communist Party in Dongjiang was in the Shimentou house in Guanqiao Village, Guanqiao Nest Station, in the middle section of the Chaozhou-Shantou Railway, and they were currently holding an important meeting. Chen Shizhao, the detective section chief, and Zhuang Le, the captain, immediately led 30 detectives on a Chaozhou-Shantou train to Guanqiao at 2 p.m. After getting off the train, they traveled about two li through Niuma Pu and arrived near the Communist den in Shimentou, which was backed by a small mountain. The alleys were winding, and there were three layers of gates. At that time, the Communists were holding a meeting in the main hall. The detective team, not knowing the specifics, opened fire first. The bandits also closed the door and resisted. For a time, the sound of gunfire was dense and continuous. Detective Huang Jinshui was shot and killed on the spot. After about an hour of confrontation, two bandits were captured alive, and six were killed. Chen Zixiang, Yang Qibiao, Yang Qiqing, and others were important figures. Another female bandit named Chen Shuying was only 19 years old and very beautiful. She had previously studied at the Hong Kong Chinese College and was from outside the North Gate of Meixian County. She is now serving as a Communist Party secretary. The detective team escorted the six captured individuals back to Shantou on the evening train. According to the interrogation by the Public Security Bureau, one of the bandits killed on the spot was a member of the Chaoan County Soviet, and the other was the secretary of the Chaoan bogus committee. Chen Zixiang, who was captured alive, was a member of the bogus Guangdong Provincial Committee. Chen Shuying was the secretary of the bogus Provincial Committee. The rest were two members of the Dongjiang Special Committee and two Red Guard captains. Wu Xiguo, Huang Maoquan, and Lin Xianghu, who were captured in Shantou, were all members of the bogus Shantou Municipal Committee. Wu had set up an agency at No. 10 Waima Road in Shantou, specializing in gathering military and political news. All the arrested individuals are currently detained in the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. (November 2nd)</p>
<h3>Cao Fulin's Troops Return to Jinan</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Cao Fulin, the commander of the 14th Army, was ordered to go east for two purposes: to supervise the suppression of bandits and to eliminate the remnants of Gao Guizi's troops.

Brigade Commander Lü Xinwu arrived in Jinan yesterday to pay respects to Han and express his obedience to orders. The brigade of over a thousand men will arrive within days. The remaining troops of Gao Jianbai are no longer a problem. Small groups of bandits will be taken care of by the 73rd Division of Zhan Shutang, so there is no need for a large army. Therefore, Cao Fulin has been ordered to return to Jinan. Cao originally brought two trainloads of troops from Jinan.

<p>Chen Diaoyuan and Ruan Zhaochang Arrive in Wuhu</p>
<h3>Chen Will Go to Anqing After Inspecting the Troops</h3>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: Chen Diaoyuan, the chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, came to Anhui to take office and preside over the Anhui government with various provincial committee members. He arrived in Wuhu at 12 noon today (6th) from Nanjing on the Anfeng charter boat. Wuhu has the 55th and 57th Division troops newly arrived from the front, Chen made a special trip to shore to inspect. Those who followed included the 55th Division Commander Ruan Zhaochang, the Chief of Staff of the Reserve Headquarters Liu Weiliang, the Adjutant General Hao Guoxi, and more than ten people. All circles here had pre-organized a welcoming party at the Jiangkou Zhonghua Hotel. After Chen landed ashore and rested for a while, he attended the welcoming party of all circles at one o'clock in the afternoon. The county party committee Zhang Shuye spoke on behalf of all circles. It was roughly stated that Chairman Chen was a loyal and brave comrade of this party. In the past, he had considerable achievements in governing Anhui and Shandong. It is especially worthy of the public's welcome to come to Anhui again to suppress the rebels and eliminate the obstacles of the revolution, and it is hoped that Chen will pay attention to the following two things: 1. Eliminate the bandits and communists so that the people of Anhui can live and work in peace. 2. Strive to complete the training of the government and complete local autonomy. Chen Diaoyuan then stood up and replied, roughly stating that Diaoyuan was very ashamed to be welcomed by all circles when he came to Anhui again. Recalling the Republic of China in the seventeenth year, he once served the people of Anhui, but he was immediately transferred to Shandong without any achievements. However, he has never forgotten the people of Anhui for a day. Now I dare to tell you the principle of not aiming high and not rushing. (1) In the political aspect, the only key is to never increase the burden on the people of Anhui. Everything should be done according to the amount of income. Now that the training period has arrived, construction is especially important. The automobile roads from Anqing to Hefei and from Guangde to Tunxi should be actively completed, and all revolutionary obstacles should be eliminated in the shortest possible time to implement local autonomy. (2) In terms of public security, the Communist Party is a hidden danger, and bandits are only a superficial disease. The Communist Party carries out its destructive behavior everywhere. The destruction of the Jingdezhen porcelain industry in Jiangxi this time is a clear proof. The communists on the border of Jiangxi and Anhui are extremely rampant, and the communists in southern Anhui are also a hidden danger. However, the neighboring danger must be eliminated first before this province can be consolidated. It has now been decided to transfer the Ruan Zhaochang department of the 55th Division to the border of Jiangxi to suppress the communists. One brigade of the Yue Shengxuan department of the 57th Division will be left in this province to work hard to eliminate bandits. Diaoyuan will be fully responsible for the public security in this province, and the people of Anhui can rest assured. (3) In terms of military affairs, the Fan Xiji department of the 46th Division has now been stationed in Bengbu, and the Ruan Zhaochang department of the 55th Division is continuing to depart to Jiangxi. The Yue Shengxuan department of the 57th Division is stationed in central and southern Anhui. The above three divisions and two brigades have been instructed by the central government to be commanded by Diaoyuan. However, after the war, the army must be greatly reorganized, and military discipline and discipline must be paid more attention to. I hope that the people of Anhui will not abandon and assist. Then I will be very grateful. Because the time is rushed today, it is inconvenient to talk more. I will find a good meeting in the future. After the speech, he immediately left his seat with Ruan Zhaochang and took a car to the Taikoo Wharf to inspect the troops of the 55th and 57th Divisions who had already arrived in Wuhu, and gave speeches to comfort them. Then he boarded the ship to meet the heads of various agencies and representatives of various groups, including Zhu Dian, a homeowner of Wanchun Township, and Zhang Yanghe, who presented the farmers in the township gathering to protest rent parades and demonstrations. Chen immediately ordered County Magistrate Yu Yuying to handle it strictly, and those who disobey would be shot. Around 4 o'clock, the visitors resigned one after another, and Anfeng then set sail for the province. Commander Ruan of the 55th Division will temporarily stay in Wuhu to wait for his troops to complete their departure before going to Jiangxi to command (November 6th).</p>

<p>Younger Brother Abducts Brother's Wife, Uncle Implicated: Zhang Xingsheng, a farmer from the 18th District, married Wang last spring. Because her husband was away at work and rarely came home, she gradually became adulterous with her husband's younger brother, Amu, like a married couple. Recently, she suddenly learned that her brother had lost his job and was about to return home, so she secretly transported out her small items one after another. On the first day of this month, she took her brother's wife out without a trace. Yesterday, Xingsheng returned to the village and learned about it. He searched everywhere but found nothing. However, for some unknown reason, he mistakenly believed that his younger brother had an affair with his wife and fled under the instigation of his uncle, a monk.

Fortunately, he was rescued by the neighbors, and his uncle personally guaranteed on the spot that he would catch up within a month.</p>

<p>Old Grain Embezzlement Case in Chunyun Continues in Liyang: It is learned that in the initial review of the old grain embezzlement case, Jiang Suoming, a citizen of Liyang County, and others filed a complaint with the Civil and Financial Affairs Office accusing Cao Qingyun's son Cao Cong and Lu Wen, Chen Ronglin and others of colluding to embezzle and steal grain. The Financial Affairs Office has instructed Inspector Shen Dingjiu to conduct a strict investigation and handle it together with this case. According to the people of Liyang, when Zhang Quan was the county magistrate and director of the Finance Bureau, Cao and Pan Bin, the deputy director of the Finance Bureau, Zou Hanliang, the chief of the levy section, Cheng Lin, the director of land tax, and Tu Zhouqing, etc., took the opportunity when the Big Sword Society bandit Cai Laowu trampled on the county town to handle the land tax. The Finance Office approved the appointment of the Director of the Jintan Finance Bureau to come to Liyang for investigation. However, he returned one day after arriving in Liyang. At this time, Zhang Quan summoned Pan Bin, Lin Hanliang and Secretary Liu to open the Grain Book Room and secretly ordered Shen Zhiqing, the current director of land tax, to hide the grain books. Before long, Zhang's dismissal order was issued, and he ordered the staff of the Land Tax Office and the officials of the Finance Bureau to sell this grain book at a price. Zou Hanliang promised to raise eight or nine thousand yuan the next day before handing over the 120,000 yuan of grain books, and the case came to an end. However, the other day, Zhang Quan suddenly came to the province in the name of a qualified police officer representative of the Jiangsu Province Examination to petition for a thorough investigation of this case. Therefore, the truth of this case is really confusing and outsiders cannot understand it. The Chairman of the Provincial Government Ye has decided to transfer Zheng Chengyuan and others to the court for interrogation yesterday (8th).</p>
<p>Doushan Xihetou Accuses Robbery Again: Xie Shouxuan, a Wuxi citizen, recently hired workers to build a wall on his father's tomb in Doushan Xihetou, the sixth district (Tianxia City), and sent his family member Xie Zhongshan (50 years old) to the village to supervise the construction. Xie arrived in the village and lived in the home of He Renbao, who was guarding the tomb. Around 12 o'clock last night, more than ten bandits suddenly came, each armed with guns and knives, broke into the house, imprisoned He Renbao and his wife in the room and did not allow them to move, tied up Xie Zhongshan with ropes and beat him severely. Then they searched at will, took their loot and left. After the incident, only Xie Zhongshan's purse was stolen, containing more than 20 yuan.</p>
<p>A Murder Case Occurred in Bezhakou: Resident Zeng Haishan, a native of Hubei, 44 years old, who resided in the 12th factory in Bezhakou near Beimen outside the county town, served as a training instructor in the Jiangyin County Government Patrol Team two years ago. He was dismissed last year and came to Wuxi to specialize in selling soil for profit. Around 1 a.m. last night, a thug holding a kitchen knife suddenly broke into the door and went straight to Haishan's room. At that time, Haishan and his wife Yao Laoer (20 years old) were sleeping soundly. The thug raised the kitchen knife and chopped Haishan's head, face, left and right arms more than 20 times. Suddenly, blood was splashing and he was unconscious. His wife Yao Laoer saw this and immediately stepped forward to snatch the knife. The thug kicked her to the ground and took the opportunity to escape. After the incident, Yao Laoer carried the injured Zeng Haishan to Ma Mingshang Brothers Hospital for treatment. However, due to excessive blood loss, his life was in danger. It is heard that Zeng Haishan's wife Yao Laoer originally had her own husband and Zeng funded her divorce. A few days ago, they quarreled over the unequal distribution of profits among their partners in the soil business. Therefore, the cause of this bloodshed is nothing more than adultery and revenge.</p>
<p>New Developments in Consecutive Robbery and Kidnapping Cases: Five families in Dengjiawan and Xiaoqiaotou in the 22nd district of the county were robbed by bandits on October 6, and seven victims were kidnapped. Except for the victims Ling Rendda and Ling Baoxian who were released by the bandits two days after being kidnapped, the remaining five people, You Junde, Ling Azhang, and Ling Jiansheng, were still in the bandit den and repeatedly sent letters demanding huge amounts of ransom. Recently, Ling Rendda entrusted a friend, A, to go to the location agreed upon in the bandit's letter to contact the bandit's representative. As a result, the victim's side first sent 3,000 yuan. The bandit's representative collected the full amount and said that Ling Jiansheng among the hostages could reduce 5,000 yuan, and the rest could also be reduced as appropriate. You Junde originally demanded 50,000 yuan and agreed to reduce 10,000 yuan. After A returned to his hometown, he informed Ling Rendda to raise money to redeem them. Then, the day before yesterday, he suddenly received the bandit's fourth letter, roughly saying that the 3,000 yuan received before was a meeting fee, limited to a certain place to meet with the victims on the 10th of this month. After reading the letter, they raised the money and still entrusted A to take the money to meet at the agreed address yesterday to redeem the tickets.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Kidnapping and Robbery in Jinjiatang, Fifth District: On the evening of the 5th, six bandits suddenly came to the home of Jin Quanda in Jinjiatang, Jingshan Township, Fifth District of Wuxian, each armed with guns and weapons. They searched the room arbitrarily. Because they did not get silver coins, they kidnapped Jin Zibao and left, with no whereabouts.</p>
<p>A Robbery Occurred in Zhoujiagang, Fu Guo: Around 12 o'clock on the evening of the 6th, seven bandits suddenly came to the home of Zhou Jipei in Zhoujiagang outside the North Gate of Wuxian County. They were all wearing blue short shirts, wearing headscarves and holding flashlights and pistols. They entered the room and robbed silver coins, soft valuables, and miscellaneous items.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Provincial Order to Investigate the Sheng Family's Rebellious Property: Last year, the National Government ordered the provincial government to order the counties of Suzhou and Changzhou to investigate and determine the amount of Sheng Xingsun's rebellious property within their borders and implement its seizure. Jiangyin had already investigated and seized a total of 13,000 and 9.2% shares of the Jimin Junda Two Pawnshops. Now, the National Government, according to a secret report, states that the Zhuo Yuan Yichuang Foundation in Changzhou has a shortage of funds and the manager of the confiscated Qianfeng Rice Store has the hope of embezzling it. Although it specifically refers to Changzhou, other counties, such as real estate pawnshops, are responsible for the safekeeping of this confiscated property. If there is any shortage, the manager will be questioned. After receiving the order, the provincial government ordered the county magistrates of Suzhou and Changzhou to immediately investigate and report on the sealed property in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Large Band of Pirates Harassing Tonghai: Recently, pirates from Haizhou and Shandong have been fleeing south from Yancheng and harassing the coastal areas of Tonghai and other three counties. The situation is very rampant. There are as many as one hundred and ten men and women who have been kidnapped. The bandit headquarters is located in Jugang Changsha Port. There are a total of 120 pirate ships with approximately 1,000 people. In addition to sending police teams to intercept them, the county magistrates reported to the bandit suppression headquarters for suppression.</p>
<p>Measures to Reorganize Local Taxes: The local financial revenue and expenditure in Tongyi is very insufficient. The county financial reorganization committee has been organized and is underway to reorganize local taxes and donations separately. (1) Add additional tax on stove land and collect it in the same way as people's land. (2) The commissioned merchant undertakes tax and donation using a bidding system. (3) The county government orders the Finance Bureau to reorganize the collection methods.</p>
<p>Collect Sandfield Case Overflows Tidal Flat: In the Liuhai Sha Jisheng case in Nantong, the overflowed tidal flats in the sixth and seventh dams were investigated and clarified by the provincial and central government committees, and all 1,300 mu were approved by the Nantong Education Bureau to receive 60 yuan per mu, and the money was returned to the national treasury. The provincial government ordered County Magistrate Zhang to implement it quickly and produce results as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Stove Field Will Be Promoted to Science: There are a total of 10,225 mu of stove fields in Tongyi. Due to the different administrative jurisdictions, there are many differences in people's stoves. The county administrative meeting decided to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance to upgrade the stove field to science and merge it into the county to benefit administration.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>County Government Meeting Resolves Dispute over Yushan Beach Land: The Zhenjiang County Government, due to a long-unresolved dispute between the China Merchants Bureau, the Education Bureau's Lifesaving Society, and Runshang School over the Yushan beach land, convened a meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. First, the representative of the China Merchants Bureau, Jiao Quheng, stated the reasons, roughly claiming that property rights should be based on contracts. In law, both parties should abide by them. When the China Merchants Bureau purchased the Yushan beach land from the Lifesaving Society, the contract clearly stated that it extended north to the riverbank, and any subsequent accretion or erosion would be the responsibility of the practitioner. Now, disregarding the contract is not only unacceptable to the China Merchants Bureau but also likely legally invalid. The Education Bureau, the Lifesaving Society, and Runshang School raised three points: (1) First, investigate whether the contract bears the county seal and the Jingkou Lifesaving Society seal; otherwise, it may be considered a private unauthorized sale and therefore invalid. (2) The contract's end states that any subsequent accretion or erosion is the responsibility of the practitioner. However, the extent of the accretion is not specified, so it cannot be assumed that the right to manage three mu and two fen of land grants unlimited accretion rights. (3) The China Merchants Bureau did not report or claim the accreted land, so it cannot legally manage it. Finally, the representative of the provincial government, Rui Jun, expressed his opinion, also deeming the contract's end clause illegal. First, the China Merchants Bureau sold three mu and two fen and two li of accreted land. If there is much more, does it all belong to the China Merchants Bureau? Second, accreted beach land naturally belongs to the state. How could the writer sell it at that time? It should be revised. The dispute continued until 6:00 PM without resolution, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>First Wife Seeks Refuge Due to Abuse: Wei Jia, residing in this city and originally from Yangzihe, formerly served at the Tianchang Shikouzhen salt depot. Later, his affair became known to the Tongfuxiang head office, resulting in his dismissal. Wei then took his anger out on his wife, Xu. Xu is the daughter of the late gentry Xu Yiqing and the younger sister of Xu Youqing. Wei resented his wife for not mediating the situation, so he often beat and verbally abused her. Recently, the whipping was excessive, and neighbors, feeling sorry for Xu, rescued her and sent her to the Women's Relief Society for assistance.</p>
<p>Department Order to Investigate Confiscated Copper Coins: The case of a large amount of copper coins confiscated by the Public Security First Branch Bureau is now being directly appealed by the original plaintiff, Wei Dun, to the Ministry of Finance, alleging that the Public Security Bureau has delayed judgment and penalties. The Ministry has instructed the Provincial Government to order the county to investigate and reply. Both the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Ministry of Finance are aware that the copper coins were reported by Nie Jingdu and Bo as circulating within the county. If this is true, they should be returned. The instruction has arrived at the county, directing it to report on how the case is being handled for reference. Yesterday (the 6th), the county government, in addition to reporting the handling process to the province for forwarding to the Ministry, also submitted reports to both ministries for instructions.</p>
<p>Education Department Orders Investigation of Stolen Files: The Education Department, finding the circumstances of the alleged theft of files concerning County Middle School Principal Bao in the Education Bureau to be strange, has specially dispatched Provincial Inspector Cao Shutian to Yangzhou on the 6th to join the county in investigating the truth of how the files, as well as various case files and account books, were stolen from the Education Bureau, so as to report to the department for verification and action.</p>
<h3>Jingjiang</h3>

On June 16th of this year, he transported a boatload of saltwater to Taixing for sale, while his wife lived on another boat. On the way, the boat encountered bandits. The boat owner and his crew were killed by the bandits, and the boat was robbed. His wife waited in Jingjiang for many days without any news. After repeated investigations, some said that he had already been killed by bandits, but the truth could not be determined. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 6th), her husband's boat was seen coming from the north. Wang's wife, without making a sound, immediately reported to the Security Corps, which dispatched corps members to arrest a total of eight people, including Ye Zixing, Qian Rongchu, Sun Di, Qian Jiulin, Wang Yunzhang, Wu Zhiming, Zhu Jiaoshi, and Bao Renyi. They were handed over to the county government for interrogation.</p>

If this is insufficient, a small temporary loan will be negotiated to clear the accounts within one month.</p>
<p>Dispute Resolved in Ministry-Province Telephone Line: The dispute over the Ministry-Province telephone line has lasted more than half a year. Now, after Commissioner Cheng's efforts to mediate, both parties resumed connections yesterday (the 8th). From now on, users in Shanghai and Hangzhou can talk immediately.

A police officer at the station, seeing that the woman's gold bracelet was worth more than a hundred yuan, suddenly had the idea to steal it. When the woman took the two children onto the car and returned to the station to get her luggage, the officer immediately robbed her. A road worker held the woman back. The woman cried out loudly, but the car drove away. The station chief entered his office, closed the door, and pretended not to hear. After the police officer obtained the bracelet, he abandoned his post and fled. Afterward, the woman reported the incident to the local Public Security Bureau, which dispatched police to arrest the road worker and bring the station chief to the bureau for questioning. Police were also dispatched in all directions to apprehend the thief.</p>
<p>Theft and Robbery of Wealthy Merchant in Xiachen, Fenghua: At 10:00 PM the night before last, more than ten bandits suddenly came to the home of Qiu Wenqing, a wealthy merchant in Xiachen, Fenghua, and broke down the door. Two bandits stood guard at the door, while the rest entered to rob. Qiu had prepared in advance and hid all the valuables in his home elsewhere. He was also not at home that night. Only several dozen yuan in silver dollars, more than a hundred corner in small money, and more than thirty pieces of ordinary clothing were stolen, totaling a loss of no more than a hundred yuan.</p>

Yesterday, he took a boat to Shanghai and then to Nanjing to handle the closing of the Propaganda Brigade. It is also said that Chiang was instructed by the Commander-in-Chief to go to Japan after the Propaganda Brigade was closed to investigate the political, economic, and social situation. He will be setting sail overseas soon.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Fierce Mother-in-Law Twice Divorces Daughter-in-Law: The wife of the late Yin Sheng, a native of Wufuzhen in the Northern Village of Shangyu, is known for her fierceness. She has two sons, the elder named Zhenglin and the younger Zhilin, both of whom are merchants in Shanghai. In 1927, the elder daughter-in-law, Xu, was divorced by order due to the mother-in-law's dissatisfaction. Resentful, Xu became a nun. At the time, the villagers disapproved of her behavior. Unexpectedly, Yin's wife did not repent and recently developed resentment towards her younger daughter-in-law, Liu, resorting to whipping and slander. Unable to bear the pain, Liu attempted suicide by taking Teng Huang poison but was rescued. Afterward, the mother-in-law again forced her daughter-in-law to return to her maiden home. When the younger son in Shanghai heard the news, he rushed back. Knowing his mother's stubborn nature, he did not dare to dissuade her. It is now learned that Liu's family has requested the mediation of Du Xisheng and Li Jiantang of Yiting, but to no avail. They have officially requested assistance from the Women's Association.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from Wang Kechang, District Chief of the Ninth District of Qingpu</h3>
<p>Recently, I read a news item in your newspaper's local correspondence column on October 25th, titled "Illegal Salt Merchant He Duo," which is inconsistent with the facts. On the afternoon of that day at around 2:00 PM, volunteer members of the Security Corps noticed a local ruffian, Luo A'jin, arguing with someone with an unknown surname over a package. They intervened, but the person with the unknown surname took the opportunity to escape. They only brought Luo A'jin and a package to my department (not the district office). When I returned to the town from Qingpu (to deliver silver), I inquired about the matter and immediately opened the package in public. There were only five pieces of clothing and nothing else. Therefore, it was sent to the Public Security Fourth Sub-station for investigation. The details in your newspaper are completely inconsistent with the facts. I am writing this special letter to request a correction. Wang Kechang, District Chief of the Ninth District of Qingpu County.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 8th - The Ministry of Education has ordered all provincial education departments and all public and private schools to uniformly observe a three-week National Calendar New Year holiday from the 19th year onward, with the exception of Guangdong Province, which, due to its proximity to the tropics, is allowed to reduce the New Year holiday by one week and add it to the summer vacation, following the revised regulations on the school year, academic schedule, and holiday dates.

<h3>Discusses the Turmoil at National Central University</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education is Responsible for Mismanagement</p>
<p>Zhang Naiyan Should Have Resigned Earlier</p>
<p>Released After Chairman Chiang Returns to Nanjing</p>
<p>Nanjing, 8th - Before the establishment of the Ministry of Education in 1928, the University Council hired Wu Zhihui as the president of National Central University. Wu did not accept the position, and the University Council ordered Zhang Naiyan to serve as acting president until Wu arrived at the university. This matter is known to the education community. Because of Wu's relationship with National Central University and his status as a veteran of the Party-State and the education community, the reporter specifically visited Wu at the Reception Center of the Construction Committee on the afternoon of the 8th to inquire about his views on the campus unrest. According to Wu, he has not heard about the affairs of National Central University recently and has no opinions to express. In general, schools cannot be run if politics are not on track. Student involvement in school administration has become a common practice since the May Fourth Movement. National Central University and the Ministry of Education are very close, and monthly reports are submitted to the ministry, such as exceeding the administrative expenses quota or improper school administrative organization. The Ministry of Education has the direct authority to correct these matters. Because of the Ministry of Education's dereliction of duty, the students have risen up to demand the improvement of school affairs. It is the students' duty to study at school. What does it matter if the president has hobbies or not? The president is like the local temple in the village. What does the temple's decline have to do with the villagers? I have repeatedly advised Mr. Zhang to resign as president earlier. Recently, seeing the worsening environment, Zhang's intention to resign has become stronger. Chairman Chiang has a plan to completely reorganize National Central University because of the complexity of the internal elements of National Central University. This plan has been very clearly expressed in his conversation with reporters. After Chairman Chiang returns to Nanjing, he can release the plan and the president can implement it in accordance with the reorganization plan. The reporter also asked about the mutual debate between Zhang Naiyan and Jiang Menglin. Wu said that this matter is a misunderstanding on both sides. Once it is explained, there will be no prejudice.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Director Xu of the Municipal Education Bureau Speaks on</h3>
<p>The Misguided Establishment of an Education Department by the Municipal Council</p>
<p>Director Xu Peihuang of the Municipal Education Bureau spoke to a reporter from the Education Society about the establishment of an Education Department by the Municipal Council of the Public Concession as follows: Since the establishment of the Municipal Government in 1927, all educational administration in the city has been handled by this bureau. Over the years, the Municipal Government has paid great attention to education throughout the city. The annual budget accounts for about 20% of the city's revenue, and no effort has been spared in reorganizing private schools. However, the two concessions in the city, relying on unequal treaties as a talisman, lie across the city, causing difficulties for the city's educational administration from time to time. It is found that the revenue in the concessions is four or five times higher than that in the Chinese area, and the burden on Chinese people is particularly heavy, but the concession authorities have always not paid attention to Chinese education. The curricula of most of the primary and secondary schools are biased towards English and do not follow the regulations set by the Ministry. Recently, they have even presumptuously established a Chinese Education Department, which is really strange. If they claim to be intending to rectify education, then this is not their share of responsibilities. If they claim to be deliberately sabotaging education, then this is even more impermissible. Regardless of their intentions, even in terms of its naming, the Education Department is the name of the highest educational institution in our country. The Municipal Council is only a private organization of foreigners in China, and should give extra respect to the highest political authority in the locality. It should not presumptuously steal the name and confuse the order. Anything heard is difficult for any citizen to tolerate, let alone this bureau, which is responsible for the city's education. I dare not be silent and report it to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Education. In addition to reporting to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Education, I have especially summarized the facts to inform the people of the country that all educational undertakings in the concessions should be handled in accordance with the regulations set by the Ministry, and no one else is allowed to overstep their authority. Moreover, they dare to privately establish a name that insinuates our country's ministries. The Municipal Council is really hard to blame, and so on.</p>
<h3>Letter from Eight Elementary Schools in Ningxiang to Foreign Minister Wang</h3>
<p>Regarding the Recovery of Educational Rights</p>
<p>A letter from teachers and staff of the Eighth Elementary School of the Ningbo Compatriot Association to Foreign Minister Wang states: "Wang Minister, Foreign Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, I respectfully inform you that recently, the Municipal Council of the Shanghai Public Concession, under the name of the Education Department of the Municipal Council, distributed school survey forms to the schools in the concession, requesting that they be sent. It is urgently trying to interfere with the education in the concession and disrupt the unified system of education in our country. We, the members of the school, deeply regret that the concessions are bound by unequal treaties, causing the administration to fall into the hands of others, and we, the people, are trapped in deep water and fire and have suffered all kinds of pain. However, apart from running a few schools, the authorities have not interfered with the public and private schools of our Chinese people. Now that your department is working hard to recover the concessions and the Municipal Government is advocating to take over the educational rights of the concessions, the authorities are wantonly and recklessly trying to seize educational power and are even using the name of the highest educational institution in our country for their department, openly insulting our country. This fully proves that the ambition of imperialists to invade our country has only increased. The policy of our late Premier to recover the concessions and abolish unequal treaties has not been implemented yet. In front of last month, we submitted a report to the Municipal Government requesting serious negotiations, and the newspapers sent letters to all walks of life, unanimously advocating. Although the voices are small, they are related to the future of the Party and the country and are by no means small matters. Therefore, as soon as this letter was sent, all walks of life responded one after another and took further steps to carry out the movement to take over the educational rights of the concessions. Judging from the excitement of the people's minds as recorded in the recent newspapers, one can get a general idea. However, the Municipal Government has not yet made any statement. Your seat is concerned about the Party and the country and is in charge of negotiations. I implore you to follow the Premier's will and carefully plan a method to deal with the situation and strive to carry out the proposition with the spirit of revolution. Also, order the Municipal Government to immediately propose negotiations, the hearts of the people will not die, how can a weak country have no diplomacy?

<p>Famous Figures in the Education Community</p>
<h3>Organizing a Phonetic Symbols Promotion Association</h3>
<p>Cai Yuanpei, Wu Jingheng, Liu Zhan'en, Ou Yuan, Chen Heqin, He Bingsong, and others have initiated the organization of a Phonetic Symbols Promotion Association to promote the application of phonetic symbols. Their declaration and brief regulations are recorded as follows: (Declaration) In 1913, the Ministry of Education held a conference on the unification of pronunciation and produced forty phonetic symbols to make it easier for illiterate people to recognize characters and for literate people to unify pronunciation. Since then, the education community has continuously carried out the movement to unify the national language. However, for more than ten years, the intellectual class has not yet achieved the hope of unification, and the literacy of the masses has not been affected at all. This year's National Education Conference knows that popularizing literacy is more important than other issues, so it changed the name of phonetic letters to phonetic symbols and prepared to add phonetic symbols next to Chinese characters everywhere as a tool for popularizing education, which in effect will also broadcast most of the national language phonemes to the people, and can also get a lot of help in unifying the national language. Now the education authorities have orders to promote it, and the society and the masses should also have an expression of promotion. Therefore, we unite with comrades to organize this association, hoping that all circles will join in helping and guiding. We hereby declare. "Brief Regulations" (1) Name: The name of this association is the Phonetic Symbols Promotion Association. (2) Purpose: The purpose of the association is to study and promote phonetic symbols. (3) Membership: Anyone who approves of the purpose of the association and is introduced by two or more members may become a member of the association. (4) Staff: 1. The association has nine executive committee members to form an executive committee to preside over all association affairs. 2. The executive committee has three standing committee members. 3. The executive committee may hire several clerks as it deems appropriate to assist with association affairs. (5) Supplementary Rules: If these brief regulations are not perfect, they may be amended by a public resolution of the members. It is said that the preparatory office of the association is temporarily located in the Youth Association on Sichuan Road.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren Takes Office as Principal of China Public School</h3>
<p>(National News Agency) The issue of the principal of China Public School in Wusong has been resolved by the school's board of directors, who have appointed Yu Youren as the successor. Mr. Yu is scheduled to go to the school on the 10th of this month to take over the affairs. The board of directors issued a notice on the 6th. The student union that resolved the student unrest also issued a second declaration yesterday, expressing their warm welcome to Mr. Yu. The notice from the board of directors is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Notice from the Board of Directors: The board of directors of China Public School posted a notice at the school on the 6th of this month, stating: "Two years ago, all the students of our school sent telegrams and representatives to urge Principal Yu Youren to come, but he could not. This time, the board of directors elected him, and after our representatives repeatedly urged him and all the faculty and students repeatedly welcomed him, he finally agreed to come to the school on the 10th of this month. He is coming despite his illness, and his enthusiasm for maintaining our school is truly something we are extremely grateful for. He has been a volunteer director of our school for more than 20 years, an old teacher of our school for 20 years, the most powerful founder of our school, and the drafter of the declaration for founding our school. His relationship with our school is closer than anyone else's. He is an old poet of our time and a senior figure in the educational and journalistic circles. Many thoughtful middle-aged and young people have been influenced or trained by him. His indomitable spirit will surely invigorate the whole school and enable our school to achieve the greatest development in the shortest possible time. This is what we firmly believe. We anticipate the development within our school and wish Principal Yu good health." This announcement is made by the Chairman of the Board, Cai Yuanpei, on November 2nd of the 19th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1930].</p>

Now, according to the instructions of the Ministry of Education, this case has been repeatedly ordered to be handled, but the school still does not comply, which is contrary to the statement made by the school's board of directors when applying for registration that they were willing to be responsible for clearing the debts. Now, we will give the school another deadline to clear the school building debts by the end of this year. Otherwise, it will be dealt with according to the regulations.

<h3>Huadong Basketball Team Defeats Mailings Yesterday</h3>
<p>Score: 34 to 14</p>
<p>The Huadong Sports Company's basketball team played a friendly match against Mailings last night at 8 PM at the West YMCA. The Mailings team has undergone major changes, with many of its former star players having scattered. Only Wei Shipi remains. Their performance is far from what it used to be. It is hoped that after three or four weeks of rigorous training, they can regain their former glory. The Huadong team, on the other hand, is made up of top talents of the time, and it was always expected that they would stand out. What the team needs most now is strategy and internal and external cooperation. The match was divided into four quarters, each lasting ten minutes. In the first and fourth quarters, both sides fielded their best players, which was quite impressive. The rest of the time, they were like a sheet of loose sand. Huadong's initial lineup consisted of Liang Guo, Fu Wufan, Li Chengyuan, Wang Jinpeng, and Lu Zhensui. Liang opened the scoring for Huadong when a pass from Li was grabbed by Liang and thrown into the basket. Mailings veteran Wei Shipi scored a basket, tying the score. Li Chengyuan then took advantage of free throw opportunities, scoring one himself and having Liang score another, quickly giving Huadong a 5-2 lead. Soon after, Fu scored, and Li and Liang also scored, while Mailings, under the close watch of Lu and Wang, only had Bi Shaopo score a basket. The result of the first quarter was Huadong 11 points, Mailings 4 points. The lineup was greatly changed in the second quarter, and Mailings' momentum increased. At the end of the first half, Huadong had 13 points and Mailings had 10 points. The lineup was changed again in the second half, and Huadong continued to take the lead and was very active. The score in the third quarter was Huadong 17, Mailings 12. In the fourth quarter, the two teams again fielded their best players to make a final push. Although Huadong benefited from their great momentum and won the match, there was no outstanding performance in terms of team cooperation and strategy. This may be because the team has not been formed for long. The final score was 31-14, with Huadong winning. The referee was Beilisi.</p>
<h3>Chizhi Basketball Team Defeats Qingguang</h3>
<p>Score: 46 to 33</p>
<p>The Chizhi and Qingguang basketball teams played a friendly match last night at 7:30 PM at the China Basketball Room. The competition between the two sides was very fierce. Chizhi had average talent and great courage, and they fought hard throughout the match. Qingguang relied entirely on the command of Tan Dahua, and although the rest of the players worked hard, they found it difficult to penetrate under the close watch of the opponents. Chizhi took the lead all the way and remained in a leading position. As a result, Chizhi won 46-33. At the beginning of the match, Chizhi launched a strong attack and scored several points in a row, leading by scores such as 6-0 and 12-3. Qingguang worked hard to catch up and made some progress. The score at halftime was 18-14, with Chizhi winning. In the second half, Qingguang launched a counterattack and made some progress, once reaching a score of 19-20, with only one point separating the two teams. However, after that, Chizhi's momentum became very strong, and Yang Linyu, Wei Haiqing, and Liu Peichu scored repeatedly, quickly increasing the score to 40-23. After that, Chizhi's defense relaxed slightly, and Qingguang took the opportunity to attack and catch up with several points. As a result, Chizhi finally won 46-33.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Policies by Zhang Yi'ou</h3>
<p>Industry and commerce are the crystallization of opportune timing, geographical advantages, and human harmony. In other words, the three—timing, geographical advantages, and policies—are indispensable. Policy is especially important. With good policies, even if timing and geographical advantages are somewhat lacking, it is not difficult to make up for them as much as possible. Without good policies, even if timing and geographical advantages are superior, they cannot be fully utilized. Our country is vast in territory and rich in resources, and its people are diligent, simple, and hard-working. It can be established as a nation based on agriculture, and it can also be established as a nation based on industry and commerce. Good opportunities often arise. A brief examination reveals that there is generally an excellent opportunity every ten years:</p>
<p>(1) In 1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki allowed foreigners to establish factories in China, giving us the opportunity to imitate them nearby. Although this had more disadvantages than advantages, most of our existing industries and businesses have been formed by such observation and imitation, which must be regarded as a kind of opportunity.</p>
<p>(2) In 1906, the United States banned Chinese laborers, and we boycotted American goods, giving us the opportunity to resolutely promote national goods, which was a relatively advantageous situation. Subsequently, the May Fourth Movement in 1919 and the May Thirtieth Incident in 1925 led to an increase in domestic production each time the banner of boycotting foreign goods was raised. Tracing back to the source, it is necessary to give credit to the first determination in 1905.</p>
<p>(3) The period of the European War from 1914 to 1919 provided us with an opportunity for full development. It was a truly unexpected good opportunity. If, at that time, our country's various basic industries had already reached a considerable scale, and we were able to expand our own machinery and chemical materials as much as possible, and to expand our shipping and international exchange, it would not have been difficult to turn poverty into wealth, to leap from an agricultural country to an industrial and commercial country, to leap from a silver standard to a gold standard, and to leap from a debtor to a creditor. Even if the foundation laid by predecessors was flawed, if we could unite from top to bottom and advance at double speed, we could at least increase mass production and transform the long-standing excess of imports into an excess of exports. Unexpectedly, the military and political authorities began to actively engage in internal disputes at this time, completely wiping out this unprecedented opportunity without realizing it. Impatience in small matters ruins great plans, and it can only be attributed to fate.</p>
<p>(4) In 1927, the sixteenth year of the Republic, the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, and the following year, it recovered Peiping, unifying the country. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "The International Development of China" became popular throughout the country, providing a compass for opening up new things and completing tasks for future generations, representing the newest and greatest opportunity. Everyone missed the opportunity of the European War, but Dr. Sun Yat-sen uniquely conceived and planned this grand strategy. "The International Development of China" was completed shortly after the end of the European War, truly embodying the idea that "deep sorrow inspires wisdom." From now on, we do not need to talk excessively about policy, nor is it possible to formulate new policies. We can only sincerely and wholeheartedly accept Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings.</p>
<p>In summary, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's plan takes the development of transportation and the construction of ports as its warp, and the establishment of large factories and the revitalization of industry as its weft, encompassing all aspects of trade promotion and benefiting workers. We may not be able to fully grasp its essence in our lifetime, but with our limited knowledge, we can glimpse its great characteristics, which can be roughly summarized into two points:</p>
<p>(1) The "industry" in "The International Development of China" is based on the Principle of People's Livelihood, not capitalism. Therefore, important enterprises should focus on state-owned operations in order to universally realize the Principle of People's Livelihood and avoid excessive development of private capital, which could lead to class struggle.</p>
<p>(2) The "plan" in "The International Development of China" is comprehensive and cyclical, not haphazard. Therefore, everything that should be done is considered in advance in order to avoid the drawbacks of being fragmented, incomplete, or putting the cart before the horse. However, when discussing development in detail, it is necessary to seek nourishment from the following four principles: (1) We must choose the most favorable path to attract foreign investment. (2) We must meet the most urgent needs of the people. (3) We must strive for the least resistance. (4) We must choose the most suitable location. Supposing that after the European War, the belligerent countries and even the neutral countries could sincerely assist our construction with 60 million US dollars per day or 21.9 billion US dollars per year as Dr. Sun Yat-sen hoped, not only would our country be able to make rapid progress, but the unemployment problems of various countries would also not suddenly arise (The increasing number of unemployed workers has become a universal phenomenon in various countries. The authorities have no solutions. Some advocate using these unemployed workers in construction projects, but they do not know that in countries where culture has reached a considerable level, construction projects are no more than a careful embellishment, the funds used are equivalent to being stranded, and all labor is equivalent to being wasted. It is far better to follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's plan to directly or indirectly help us develop, invest in favorable paths, and use people in beneficial things). Unfortunately, people from various countries did not have this ambition and waited and watched, and they have not understood that a great opportunity has almost passed. Although we sincerely accept the entire plan of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the order of implementation, the scale, and the speed of success may have to be changed to some extent in reality. Take the "industry" as an example. Dr. Sun Yat-sen believed that a talented but poor young man had wealthy relatives who could help him. Therefore, he planned for him to first enter university, then study abroad and intern, and then bring back machinery when he returned to China to establish a large enterprise. However, if his relatives are snobbish and absolutely unwilling to help him succeed, then this young man can only do his best within his limited means, or work part-time and study part-time, or operate on a small scale in order to gradually achieve his goal, still living up to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's high expectations. This is what is called "acting for profit, acting for peace, or acting reluctantly, but their success is the same."</p>
<p>In the spring of 1928, Minister of Industry and Commerce Kong Xiangxi's administrative declaration outlined sixteen points, the main points being (taking the Principle of People's Livelihood as the goal and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "The International Development of China" as the guide, protecting existing enterprises on the one hand, and seeking to develop new opportunities on the other, consolidating the national economy on the one hand, and increasing the welfare of workers on the other, cultivating the vitality of industry with the spirit of labor-capital cooperation, and promoting international cooperation with the principle of amicable trade, carrying out construction in order of urgency and priority). (This is a simplified version of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's plan. Our country's industrial and commercial policies already have Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "The International Development of China" in its entirety and Minister Kong's administrative declaration in its essence. Who am I? I should naturally narrate rather than create. However, based on the current situation of our country, I dare to seek even greater simplicity in the policies that Minister Kong has already simplified, so that they are easier to implement, and I will elaborate on a few points as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Establish a definite protection policy. In all aspects of formulating tariffs, revising commercial treaties, organizing internal taxes, and drafting laws and regulations, we must recognize the protection policy as the only savior of infant industries. Externally, we must not fear the strong, and internally, we must not hesitate to sacrifice. It is best to go all out. A committee should be formed jointly by the Ministries of Industry and Commerce, Agriculture and Mining, Finance, Railways, Communications, and Foreign Affairs to conduct joint research in order to avoid the drawback of each department formulating its own policies without being consistent.</p>
<p>(2) Encourage private enterprises. Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated that state-owned enterprises should be subject to two conditions: (1) those with a monopolistic nature that cannot be entrusted to individuals, and (2) those that are difficult to operate and require a large amount of capital, and that require the use of foreign capital and foreign experts. As for those that can be entrusted to individuals or that are more suitable for private operation than state operation, he explicitly instructed us (should be done by individuals, encouraged by the state, and protected by law). He also said (If we want to facilitate the development of individual enterprises in China, the suicidal tax system that has been practiced should be abolished immediately, the chaotic currency should be improved, and all kinds of official obstacles must be removed. In particular, it is necessary to assist with convenient transportation. Now that state-owned enterprises are plagued by financial difficulties and cannot be established, Minister Kong has strongly advocated that the nine basic industries be reduced to five, but even one has not yet been established. Therefore, for private enterprises, we should naturally do our best to encourage them. In addition to rigorously implementing the existing Law on the Encouragement of Special Industries and the Special Tax Law on Machine-Made Goods, we should further expand them. Even for basic industries with low capital and high profits that should be state-owned, I believe that several types can be designated to be contracted by merchants using the guaranteed interest method, and for industries with a monopolistic nature, they should be opened up appropriately under government supervision.</p>
<p>(3) Concentrate strength externally and harmonize interests internally. The organization of our country's industry and commerce is generally small in scale and its strength is scattered, making it unable to compete with foreign merchants who are skilled in manipulation. Important foreign enterprises are not only united throughout the country, but even related countries are united. Our country should imitate them and act accordingly. However, if it is not done properly, it is easy to create monopolies and mergers, which may violate party principles. Therefore, while concentrating strength externally, we must harmonize interests internally and not allow the strong to bully the weak or engage in manipulative oppression. The methods for promoting benefits and preventing abuses can be implemented through industry covenants under government guidance.</p>
<p>(4) Strive for labor-capital harmony. Ever since the so-called labor problem arose, relying on instigation from others, it seems that labor and capital should go to extremes and fight to the death. This is a great fallacy. The relationship between people must be like two people sharing only one piece of clothing, or two men sharing only one woman. One gain must be a loss, and there is absolutely no room for activity before an irreconcilable situation can be formed. In industrially advanced countries, this situation has gradually been reached, but our country still has unlimited natural benefits that can be jointly seized by labor and capital. Due to unskilled skills and poor tools, the working ability of the labor side is far inferior to others. If it can be gradually improved to increase efficiency, wages can be increased proportionally. Due to improper planning and poor management on the capital side, money is wasted without knowing how much. If it can strive for improvement to save money, wages can also be relaxed. I once wrote an article on "The Relationship between Labor-Capital and Engineering," which explains this principle. Here, I will only add two points:</p>
<p>(1) The capital side must have considerable management rights. The party and government should not interfere unless there is excessive behavior. As the saying goes, "The way to govern is to remove the extremes." The right to navigate a ship must belong to the captain. If people on the same boat or people on both sides of the shore can interfere at will, danger will immediately occur.</p>
<p>(2) When wages increase to a considerable level, a portion should be saved to be transformed into capital. I have spent a lot of time interacting with workers both abroad and in my own country, and I have seen that foreign workers spend their money on alcohol, while Chinese workers spend their money on gambling. Increasing wages and improving living standards are two different things. If a fixed percentage can be deducted and saved at any time to join the share capital, it can not only cultivate a habit of thrift, but also gradually bring the relationship between the labor and capital classes closer and closer together. When the Ministry of Industry and Commerce drafted the Company Law, I had this proposal, but unfortunately it was not implemented.</p>
<p>(5) Protect handicrafts in all cases. "Unemployment" is a term used exclusively by industrially advanced countries. "Unemployed" refers to those who have already established a career and suddenly lost it. In our country, the majority of people have never established a career or had a career. They are directly "unemployed." Not only is it difficult to start machine industries suddenly in poor and remote areas, so it is necessary to protect handicrafts to maintain livelihoods, but even in major cities, there is still a surplus of people, and those who seek manual labor in factories but cannot find it still rely on handicrafts for subsistence. In Eastern and Western countries, the number of unemployed people is only several tens of thousands at the least, and no more than several hundreds of thousands or one million at the most, which is already considered a very big problem. The number of unemployed people in our country is at least more than 100 million. How can it not be a problem? In addition to exempting native cloth from taxes, I believe that the treatment of handicrafts should at least be equal to that of machine-made foreign goods in order to be in line with the national conditions and the times.</p>
<p>There are also two things that can be appended here as concluding remarks:</p>
<p>(1) The recent import of "rationalization," in my opinion, can be said to be a good medicine for saving the times in a country where industry is still in its infancy and people are suffering from unemployment, but in a country where industry is already excessive and people are suffering from unemployment, it is no different from adding fuel to the fire. The so-called "rationalization," although its arguments are lofty and its logic is meticulous, its results are nothing more than saving labor, saving materials, saving turnover, and saving middlemen. After saving again and again, directly and indirectly, the ultimate saving is only people. Therefore, in a country that is still in its infancy, if rationalization can be used to eliminate waste, then the goods will be of good quality and low price, which can resist imports externally and guide enterprises internally. Unemployed people can also have jobs, and both industries and people will have plenty of room to maneuver. However, it is not appropriate to hold this high-sounding argument to bind all small industries or handicrafts that are temporarily difficult to rationalize due to environmental reasons, and to despise and treat them badly. In countries where industrial development is already excessive, the more rationalization there is, the more unbearable it will be. Those capitalists only know that saving labor, saving materials, saving turnover, and saving middlemen can reduce costs and lower prices in order to sell their surplus goods, but they do not know that the market is ultimately limited, and the number of unemployed people will inevitably increase even more. This is what is called knowing one thing but not knowing the other. There are no unchanging theories in the world, and there are no indestructible systems. The current industrial system has already reached the point of collapse, and the theories will also change accordingly. The industrial revolution in the future must adopt the principle of "everyone having food to eat." Proper rationalization should conform to the following principles:</p>
<p>(1) All arduous and demeaning work that cannot be overcome by human power or that is inhumane should be done by machines, and they must be constantly refined so that workers who operate machines are not affected by arduous and demeaning work.</p>
<p>(2) For all simple and noble work that can be overcome by human power and that can be done without hindering humanity, the use of machines and the degree of rationalization should be moderate so that everyone has work to do. Otherwise, if rationalization is taken to the extreme, one industry will only need one factory, and one city will only need one store. If the private property system is still implemented, it will be a case of a few being full while the majority are hungry. If the public property system is used instead, it will be a case of a few being working while the majority are at ease. In essence, it seems that neither can form a world or a life. Gandhi not only wears coarse cloth, but also carries an old-fashioned spinning machine to spin yarn. If we do not think he is crazy, then his thoughts and actions are worth studying. Moreover, in our country, the machine industry has not yet developed. In poor and remote areas, only handicrafts can accumulate small gains into large profits. How can we despise them?</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the recent gold price and silver devaluation turmoil, people in the field have racked their brains to address the root cause and treat the symptoms, and various opinions have been put forward in a mixed manner, but no conclusion has been reached, and it still awaits the convening of an economic conference to solicit public opinion from the whole country. I am well aware that this matter is of great importance, and a slight deviation can lead to a loss of a thousand miles. The rise and fall of a country can be determined by a single word, so I have never dared to lightly express my opinion. However, the following two points are beneficial and harmless, so I will briefly describe them:</p>
<p>(1) Abolish the tael and establish the yuan, and standardize auxiliary coins to use the decimal system uniformly. This is what Dr. Sun Yat-sen called "the chaotic currency system must be improved." Without doing this, it cannot become a national currency, nor can it become a country. Even without a gold rush, it should be done. After the tael is abolished and the yuan is established, it will be easier to crack down on the entry and exit of raw silver, which will also help to alleviate the gold rush.</p>
<p>(2) Increase production as much as possible. Eliminate warlords and bandits, and encourage both machine-made goods and handicrafts in order to drastically increase exports and sharply reduce imports. Whether it is gold coins or silver coins, they originally had a legal price in the country and were originally chips. Only when they flowed out to foreign countries were they regarded as goods and did issues of prices arise. If our country's foreign trade is in surplus rather than deficit, even if silver depreciates daily, there is no need to rush to exchange it for gold, so how can there be such panic? As for switching to the gold standard,</p>
<p>Seventh General Meeting</p>
<h3>Zheng Hongnian, Chairman</h3>
<p>The National Industry and Commerce Conference opened on the 1st. The more than 500 proposals were first divided into six groups for review. Each group was further divided into several small teams for careful review. After the proposals were deliberated one by one by the General Meeting, the important cases, such as the organization of the Industrial and Commercial Rationalization Research Association, the Labor-Capital Coordination Plan, the promotion of national goods, the change of the third accounting period, the reorganization of the tax system, and basic industries... were all approved. Some were handed over to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for promulgation and implementation, and some were handed over to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for adoption or to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for submission to the central government for implementation. After six general meetings, all cases were deliberated separately. At 9:00 a.m. on the 8th, the General Meeting Declaration was passed in the auditorium of the Lixishe. 120 members attended. Wu Zhihui, Wang Zhengting, and others attended. Chairman Zheng Hongnian presided over the ceremony as usual.</p>
<p>The Chairman reported that the declaration of the Association had been drafted. He asked Hu Shuhua to read it aloud first. If there were any objections or amendments, they could be raised for discussion.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the National Industry and Commerce Conference</h3>
<p>408 proposals were discussed, covering a total of ten major issues.</p>
<p>Hoping that the central and local governments will consider the suffering of the people's livelihood,</p>
<p>eliminate obstacles, and promote peaceful development of people's livelihood and international equality.</p>
<p>The completion of the National Revolution is aimed at the realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood as the highest goal, and the economic construction during the period of political tutelage should follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "The International Development of China" to develop productive industries and increase the national economy as the only important plan. Now that the national unification and construction have begun, and the first National Industry and Commerce Conference is being held at this time, the members of this Association are attending the grand occasion. Since the opening on November 1st, although it has only been eight days, the total number of proposals discussed is 406, and the temporary motions are not included. Thanks to the guidance of the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the heads of industrial and commercial administrations, and relying on the efforts and cooperation of all members and staff of the Association, all the most important and fundamental problems currently recognized by the industrial and commercial circles, such as labor problems, scientific management problems, industrial and commercial financial problems, protection tariffs and the abolition of exorbitant taxes and levies, the promotion of national goods, basic industry problems, unemployment relief problems, assistance in the development of major industries, transportation problems, international trade problems, and industrial and commercial administration and industrial and commercial regulations problems, have been repeatedly discussed and carefully deliberated. The main points can be summarized into ten points:</p>
<h3>(1) Regarding the Resisting Economic Aggression</h3>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that (the national economy and all production can be fully developed after China joins the ranks of international equality), and the abolition of unequal treaties, the abolition of consular jurisdiction, and the implementation of protective tariffs are the basic conditions for the development of our country's infant industries. This is one of the issues that this conference is most concerned about.</p>
<h3>(2) Regarding Joint Operation</h3>
<p>If we want to compete with foreign industries, we must have large-scale manufacturing and the latest sales methods, and concentrate capital, concentrate raw materials, concentrate machinery and manpower in order to save consumption and reduce costs is especially urgent. Recently, the match and enamel industries have implemented joint operations or joint sales in order to reduce production costs and resist the foreign merchants' hoarding plan. In the future, major industries and businesses such as silk, cotton cloth, tea, [missing character], cement, tung oil, and soybeans will also have to adopt the same strategy to cope with the environment and carefully plan for the aftermath. Now is the time for everyone to work together. This is the second issue that this conference is most concerned about.</p>
<h3>(3) Regarding the Reorganization of the Tax System</h3>
<p>Developing production should start with the abolition of exorbitant taxes and levies, and reforming the commercial tax system is especially fundamental. The discussion on abolishing "li" (transit taxes) has been advocated for nearly 30 years, but due to the country's multiple misfortunes and the high military expenditures, the inherent "li" tax has not been abolished, and the exorbitant taxes and levies that have been cleverly established have become even more intensified. Now,</p>
<p>the government has clearly ordered the abolition of "li" taxes before January 1, 1929. All industrial and commercial circles are very fortunate. There were more than 50 proposals requesting the abolition of "li" taxes and various exorbitant taxes and levies. The eagerness to abolish them can be seen from this. It is hoped that the government will implement them as scheduled to comfort the people's desire. This is the third issue that this conference is most concerned about.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Improvement of the Monetary System</h3>
<p>The government already has a plan for improving the monetary system. At the recent time of high gold prices and silver, special attention should be paid to the establishment of a gold standard system. However, this conference believes that this matter is of great importance and must have sufficient preparation and appropriate steps. For the present, it is better to start by reorganizing the complex and chaotic current monetary system, unifying silver dollars, abolishing the tael and establishing the yuan, and determining the paper money issuance system, and then gradually adopting the gold standard system after considering the situation and circumstances. This is the fourth issue that this conference is most concerned about.</p>
<p>Although the discussions about the gold standard by prominent people have gradually become consistent, I am still suspicious. Our country should have switched to the gold standard during the European War, when gold was cheap and silver was expensive, and when India had not yet used gold. The opportunity was lost long ago. Now gold is expensive and silver is cheap, and we are the only country that uses silver. If we also abolish silver, silver will become even cheaper, and the value of the people's property will undoubtedly fall by one-third or one-half. Moreover, the gold standard system requires the minting of gold coins, and the gold exchange standard system also requires depositing a large amount of gold in foreign banks. Today, with the world in dire straits, how can we obtain gold? The United Kingdom and the United States use gold because they have gold mines in their own country or their territories. Germany and Japan use gold because they have the war reparations from France. Everyone has a source, but we have none. How can we do it? So, can the silver standard be maintained temporarily? Yes, our population accounts for one-fourth or more of the world's population. If we can be peaceful every year and everyone is diligent, then the country will have circulation and the heavens and the earth will all use gold. What is wrong with us using silver alone? Moreover, monetary system theories have also been shaken, and credit standard systems, land rent standard systems, and international compound standard systems are emerging. Why not bear it for a moment to observe the changes? In short, our country has a vast territory and abundant resources, and a large population. If we can revitalize ourselves, we can stand tall and form our own style. If we cannot revitalize ourselves, we will follow the tide and rely on plants and trees, and it will not be enough for everything. All things are like this, and the monetary system is just one example.</p>
<h3>Passing the Declaration</h3>
<p>The Chairman said that the declaration of the Association includes all the proposals of the Association. If there are no objections, it will be considered passed.</p>
<p>Organization</p>
<h3>International Trade Association</h3>
<p>Gao Bingfang reported that the General Meeting decided to organize the International Trade Association. Members will be appointed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and announced before the closing ceremony. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce appointed 89 people, including Zhang Gongquan (the list is detailed separately), as members of the International Trade Association in accordance with this resolution. Gao finished his report and took a five-minute break to hold the closing ceremony.</p>
<h3>(5) Regarding Scientific Management and Industrial Rationalization</h3>
<p>Our country's industry is backward, and it is not enough to implement scientific management and industrial rationalization to save and develop it. This conference, in view of the fact that the development of industry and commerce in the United States and Germany is due to the prevalence of scientific management and rationalization, proposes that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce invite the relevant agencies in charge of industrial and commercial administration, important domestic academic organizations, professional organizations, and labor representatives to form a National Industrial Rationalization Research Association and expand the China Industrial and Commercial Management Association to establish branches in various provinces and cities in order to reform the economic organization and increase productivity. There is no other way to change the direction of events and make a fresh start. This is the fifth issue that this conference is most concerned about.</p>
<h3>(6) Regarding Basic Industries</h3>
<p>Basic industries are the mother of general industrial development. Therefore, if we want to develop industry, we must first pay attention to the revitalization of basic industries. This conference unanimously resolved to request the government to implement the pre-planned basic industry projects such as acid-base, iron, coal, cotton, and wool in the shortest possible time. Other industries such as paper, sugar, and rayon should also be considered and encouraged in many ways so that they can catch up and see the results together. This is the sixth issue that this conference is most concerned about.</p>
<h3>(7) Regarding Indigenous Industries</h3>
<p>In recent years, our country's indigenous industries have been declining day by day, and the products made by Europeans and Americans are also called "relics." The products are of limited production and cannot be sold overseas. If we want to save them, we should use scientific methods to improve technology and increase production. This is the seventh issue that this conference is most concerned about.</p>
<h3>(8) Regarding Labor Welfare</h3>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that (China's problem is poverty, so we should develop resources to enrich it). He also said that (the full development of productivity gives workers the opportunity to improve their living conditions). In impoverished China, if China's production cannot be developed, then the livelihoods of male, female, or child laborers cannot be improved. Therefore, the efforts of the Kuomintang to awaken the masses and the rise of the revolutionary masses are fundamentally aimed at developing China's industry, not destroying China's industry, and at building the order of production, not destroying the order of production. The leaders of the party have spoken deeply. Therefore, the interests of labor and capital are consistent, and the sincere cooperation and common prosperity of both parties are the first requirement for labor-capital harmony. This is the eighth issue that this conference is most concerned about.</p>
<h3>(9) Regarding Unemployment Problems</h3>
<p>Looking around our country's society, the number of unemployed people due to the decline in production is unknown. If we want to provide relief, there is no other way than to seek the development of production. Protecting the investment interests of Chinese and foreigners, consolidating industrial and commercial financial undertakings, encouraging emerging industries, promoting vocational education, organizing unemployment insurance, and promoting job placement are particularly urgent. This is the ninth issue that this conference is most concerned about.</p>
<h3>(10) Regarding International Trade</h3>
<p>In the domestic market, our country should do its best to compete with foreign goods. In the foreign market, we should strive to export in large quantities in order to further promote the movement to promote national goods. In order to achieve this goal, we must gather practical knowledge and make careful plans, expand international exchange banks, establish foreign shipping businesses, dispatch commercial commissioners, and establish international trade associations are important measures that address both the root and the symptoms. This is the tenth issue that this conference is most concerned about.</p>
<p>In short, the national economic organization is a large organic whole. If we want to fully develop this organic whole, we must rely on the common efforts of the entire nation. In this common effort, our industrial and commercial circles are the strong backbone, and active [missing character] must be carried out without delay. Only when the government and the people sincerely work together can we achieve complete success. It is hoped that our central and local governments will consider</p>
<p>Closing Ceremony</p>
<h3>Chairman Zheng's Closing Remarks</h3>
<p>Thanks to the members and all sectors of society.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce should implement the resolutions.</p>
<p>The closing ceremony was held at 10:00 a.m. Chairman Zheng Hongnian performed the ceremony as usual and then delivered the closing remarks, saying that this was the first National Industry and Commerce Conference. Leaders and experts from all industrial and commercial circles and representatives from 28 provinces and regions attended. This was the first National Industry and Commerce Conference to implement national unification since the establishment of the conference. The more than 400 proposals were objectively and meticulously discussed by the members and can be used as the basis for the development of industry and commerce by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in the future. The relevant agencies of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce should implement the resolutions with all their strength, and the results of the implementation should be reported to the public on this day next year. The most gratifying thing is that this resolution is based entirely on the Principle of People's Livelihood. The members came from afar, and the hospitality was inadequate. The news media worked hard at the conference and were very busy. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce expressed its apologies. All the staff and the staff of the Lixishe helped diligently. On behalf of the conference, I would like to express my sincere thanks.</p>
<p>Speeches by Guests</p>
<h3>Wu Zhihui's Speech</h3>
<p>Advocating the Significance of an Industrial and Commercial Society</p>
<p>The Importance of the People's Livelihood Principle</p>
<p>Mr. Wu said that he was an outsider to industry and commerce. Today, he offers an outsider's perspective in the hopes of eliciting a smile from everyone and celebrating the success of the conference. He has been advocating for an industrial and commercial society since his time in Lyon, believing that China cannot implement the People's Livelihood Principle without entering an industrial and commercial society. The People's Rights Principle is like building the frame of a house, while the realization of the People's Livelihood Principle is the actual construction. An industrial and commercial society is the necessary process for building that house. The "people" in People's Livelihood refers to the people of society. Humankind is born from the universe, and by nature, creation is the greatest ability of all things. People's Livelihood is based on this idea. In the fourth lecture on People's Livelihood, the Leader said that humans not only eat, but also want to eat well, comfortably, and well. Good eating depends on the social environment of the time. Human desires are endless, and industrial and commercial societies arise in response to these needs. In addition to equal land rights, the People's Livelihood Principle also aims to regulate capital. Regulation does not mean restriction, but rather to ensure proper distribution of capital to develop capital. The power of money is not the cause but the result. Humankind's needs generate value, from value comes money, from money comes power, and from power comes an industrial and commercial society. Regulating capital prevents selfishness and encourages capital development, not for the sake of capital itself or to leave it to descendants, but to develop enterprises. The development of enterprises is infinite, and this is the driving force. We hope that the development of this capital will be used to promote construction projects that benefit humankind. Curiosity is the mother of enterprise and the basis for developing capital. Maintain this spirit of curiosity and do not lose the basis of the creative spirit of creation to seek the boundless meaning of people's livelihood. This is what this outsider hopes for from everyone.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting's Speech</h3>
<p>Abolishing Consular Jurisdiction to Develop Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting said that now, as military affairs are being settled, gathering national industrial and commercial leaders in one place for this significant conference fills him with deep emotion. (1) In the past, the relationship between politics, economics, industry, and commerce was too shallow, as if politics was separate from politics, economics was separate from economics, and industry and commerce each pursued their own interests. The government regarded the industrial and commercial sector as a source of revenue, imposing heavy taxes and even using force to suppress it. Few paid attention to how to benefit industry and commerce and cultivate their vitality. Of the three elements of nation-building—politics, economics, and diplomacy—industry and commerce stand in the middle. Their position is like an electric current, while politics, economics, and diplomacy are like electric wires. Because of this close relationship, there must be practical connections. To ensure the safety of industry and commerce, we must first solve the people's livelihood, and pay close attention to diplomacy after opening up to trade. Domestic politics and economics are constantly in contact with foreign politics and economics. Compared with material civilization, there is no shortage of competition. To improve and develop industry and commerce, Chinese and foreign businesses must be treated equally. After tariff autonomy, it is like shooting each other with guns. The final victory depends on whether the bullets hit the target, and depends on the joint cooperation of the industrial and commercial sector and the government. (2) Some people believe that the failure to abolish consular jurisdiction in China is a political issue, not an economic one. This is a mistake. In the past, foreigners used the excuse that Chinese law had not been improved to refuse to abolish it. Now that it has been improved, they use the excuse that China is not peaceful enough to refuse to abolish it. Therefore, there are still six or seven countries with consular jurisdiction in China. In fact, no country in the world can be without disorder. Domestic unrest is naturally controlled by the country's armed forces, which has nothing to do with the issue of foreign consular jurisdiction. The reason why foreigners refuse to give up this right is to maintain their economic policies and protect their commerce in China, so that those under consular protection can pay less tax or no tax at all. Therefore, to achieve the goal of recovery, we must rely on political and diplomatic means, and the whole country must unite and support the government, vowing to fight to the death to gain strength. The greatest purpose of Commander-in-Chief Chiang's suppression of the rebellion this time is to eliminate major obstacles in the country, resist the oppression of imperialism, and realize China's true freedom and equality, and so on.</p>
<p>Member Speeches</p>
<h3>Hu Shuhua's Speech</h3>
<p>The Assembly Gives the People a Voice in Politics</p>
<p>The Assembly Is Not a Capitalist Conference</p>
<p>Hoping the Government Will Implement Resolutions</p>
<p>Member Hu Shuhua said that this industrial and commercial conference gives the people an opportunity to speak on political matters, which is something to be grateful for. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce is aware of the difficulties faced by industry and commerce and the hardship of people's livelihood. From now on, we should clear obstacles and renew political transformation by turning soldiers into workers. We hope that the national industrial and commercial sector will sincerely support the central government to permanently consolidate peace and unity in order to realize the People's Livelihood Principle and equality in the international arena. This is truly the glory of our entire nation, not just the welfare of the industrial and commercial sector. This conference dares to encourage itself and the people of the country.</p>
<p>We should also be grateful for the warm reception and the banquets given to us by various ministries and commissions in the capital. The efforts of the press to promote the conference and enhance its effectiveness should also be greatly appreciated. There are two misunderstandings about this conference from the outside world. (1) The outside world mistakenly believes that this conference is a capitalist conference without labor representatives. In fact, China today can be said to have no capitalists. Everyone is poor, except for bandits and corrupt officials. Everyone is a worker, so I can say that we are all workers and are not considering this as a capitalist conference, but aiming to realize the People's Livelihood.</p>
<p>(2) The outside world thinks that this conference is just a meeting, or that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will have some more files. But all of us here are good citizens who offer our opinions, hoping that the government can earnestly implement the resolutions of this conference. When the second, third, etc. industrial and commercial conferences are held in the future, the development of industry and commerce will be unlimited. Our slogan is: Long live the industrial and commercial conference!</p>
<p>Zhang Zilian's Speech</p>
<h3>Please Advocate Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>Commercial Organizations Must Change</p>
<p>Labor and Capital Must Each Obtain Fairness</p>
<p>Actively Promote the Issue of Domestic Goods</p>
<p>Zhang Zilian said that he would like to take this opportunity to express his views on the issue of advocating domestic goods while representatives from various provinces are present at this grand meeting for everyone's research. (1) The first step in advocating domestic goods should be to change the commercial organization to relieve those who promote domestic goods. The defects of the commercial organization have existed for a long time. Foreign goods occupy the market, causing merchants to be anesthetized by foreign goods for a long time. Therefore, we must awaken our compatriots and no longer be anesthetized by poison. We must unite the whole country and promote domestic goods. This is the first request of this person on behalf of the domestic goods industry.</p>
<p>(2) Domestic goods manufacturers have never had labor-capital discord. Only capitalist factories have labor-capital disputes, or there are workers with other purposes mixed in, causing trouble, and then there are labor strikes. True Chinese workers can endure hardship, are hardworking, and love the country. If they are not seduced and instigated by the outside world, they will never strike. This person is from a metalworking background and now runs five or six factories, so he knows the reality of workers well. This time, he is attending the industrial and commercial conference as a representative of workers. Some people say that the industrial and commercial conference is a capitalist conference. This person absolutely denies this. The responsibility of the manager of a factory or store must be to ensure that both labor and capital obtain fairness in order to realize the People's Livelihood. First, we must seek happiness for the masses, then the individual's position and happiness can be maintained. For example, since the opening of the Shanghai Domestic Goods Market three months ago, despite fierce competition from foreign goods piled up on the main roads and the three major companies, it has still managed to generate more than 400,000 in business. In the future, it should continue to maintain the domestic goods market, and it is hoped that everyone will actively establish domestic goods markets in various provinces and cities, gradually shifting the inertia of the Chinese people being anesthetized by foreign goods. This is the second request to everyone from the people of domestic goods.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is not worth worrying about Chinese goods being abandoned on the ground. The most worrying thing is that people are abandoned on the ground, and there are bandits everywhere, harming people endlessly. People in the industrial and commercial sector must use these abandoned people to develop abandoned goods. We must work from three aspects: you, me, and him. Therefore, the issue of advocating domestic goods is closely related to the country's economy, and we hope that it will be given great attention.</p>
<p>Telegram Request</p>
<h3>Return Detained Vehicles</h3>
<p>No More Detentions in the Future</p>
<p>Yesterday, the conference, based on a temporary motion (proposing that the conference quickly discuss ways to relieve the current difficulties of industry and commerce in order to provide relief), telegraphed the military and political authorities, saying: [Fragmented text, likely describing the issue of arbitrary vehicle detentions by military authorities]. Now that national unity and peace have been restored, it is hoped that the military authorities in various provinces will care for the country and be concerned about the people. It is earnestly hoped that they will strictly order their subordinates to refrain from unlawful actions that destroy or harm transportation agencies in the future, and to return the detained vehicles as soon as possible to facilitate transportation and alleviate commerce. We, the members of this conference, representing the national industrial and commercial sector, sincerely send this telegram, hoping that you will consider the difficulties of the times and work together to save the situation, leaving a lifeline for the transportation industry and cultivating a share of vitality for the national industrial and commercial sector. The national economy will be fortunate, and the future of industry and commerce will be fortunate. The National Industrial and Commercial Conference respectfully sends this request.</p>

<p>Review Report</p>
<h3>Fifth Group Third Report (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>The following five cases in this group have been separately reviewed by members. The opinions of the reviewers are now supplemented below.</p>
<p>Case 37: Proposing to Promote the Production of High-Quality Woolen Fabrics Nationwide to Recover Profit Rights (Huang Zengyue)</p>
<p>Case 43: Proposing to Establish a Large-Scale Woolen Fabric Factory (Zhejiang Provincial Government)</p>
<p>Case 60: Requesting the Establishment of a Specialized Woolen Factory (Cheng Zhaodong)</p>
<p>Case 74: Policy Proposal for Developing the Wool Industry in the Northwest (Zhou Yichun, Yin Renxian)</p>
<p>Case 91: Proposing to Select Sites Along the Yellow River in Gansu and Ningxia Provinces to Build a Large-Scale Woolen Fabric Factory (Shui Ziniu, Dai Kun)</p>
<p>It has been found that our country exports approximately 50 million catties of wool annually, with the Northwest being the most important production area. At a time when the demand for woolen products is increasing sharply and foreign goods are flooding the market, it is urgent to list woolen fabrics as a basic industry and implement it earnestly. On the one hand, we should organize and improve raw materials to make products excellent. The main points of each case are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Factory Location: For the convenience of transportation, factories in the Northwest should be located along the Yellow River, such as Lanzhou and Jingyuan in Gansu Province, or Zhongwei, Ningxia, Pingluo, or Baotou in Suiyuan Province. First, select a suitable location to build a factory and gradually promote it. In the Southeast, factories should first be established in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Fengtian.</p>
<p>(2) Source of Capital: The establishment of factories in the Southeast should be encouraged by the government in accordance with the measures to encourage the establishment of basic industries for people to invest. The people in the Northwest are impoverished, so the government should specially raise capital and gradually collect commercial shares.</p>
<p>(3) Raw Materials: Factories in the Northwest should use all local wool. Factories in the Southeast should primarily use domestic raw materials, but when it is necessary to imitate fashionable products, they may also use foreign wool.</p>
<p>(4) Product Outlets: Please order the military police and students to use domestic woolen fabrics for winter clothing as much as possible, and reward and encourage senior officials of government agencies to wear them.</p>
<p>(5) Improving Raw Materials: Please encourage the government to establish model pastures in the Northwest and Northeast and reward people for improving sheep breeds.</p>
<p>(6) Organizing Raw Materials: A wool washing factory and a wool inspection bureau should be established in Shizuishan in Ningxia Province or Baotou in Suiyuan Province, which are necessary transit points or gathering places in the Northwest.</p>
<p>(7) Implement Protective Tariffs: Please advise the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to increase the import tax rate on woolen products.</p>
<p>(8) Cultivating Specialists: Please ask the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to jointly with the Ministries of Education and Agriculture and Mines to find ways to train more specialists in the wool industry.</p>

<h3>New Year Entertainment Methods</h3>
<p>The Spring Festival Name Has Already Been Eliminated</p>
<p>The entertainment methods for the national calendar New Year and the thorough elimination of various decorations for the end and beginning of the lunar New Year have attracted great attention from the community.

<p>There is No Discussion of Spring Festival Closure: The City Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The first article of the Central Executive Committee's regulations on promoting the national calendar stipulates that the date of the abolition of the lunar New Year holiday and various rituals, decorations, and entertainment will be moved to before and after the national calendar New Year. No holidays are allowed for the abolished lunar New Year, and no holidays are allowed under other names. An order was issued by the Executive Yuan for promulgation and compliance. The name of the Spring Festival has already been eliminated and is not included in the various commemorative holidays stipulated by the central government. Yesterday's newspaper reported that the local Chamber of Commerce and the [blank] Line Association had already agreed to comply with the National Government's implementation of the abolition of the lunar calendar and set February 17th and 18th as the two days of the Spring Festival holiday. The Chamber of Commerce stated that the Spring Festival holiday was not discussed and has not received any letters from the Bank Association to discuss it. Since Shanghai is the focus of attention for the national industrial and commercial community, the Chamber of Commerce has officially stated that there is no resolution on the Spring Festival holiday.</p>

<p>Chinese Merchant Ships Begin</p>
<h3>Striving for Navigation Rights on the Upper Yangtze</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Sichuan Navigation Association Join Forces</p>
<p>To Break the Foreign Merchants' Aggression</p>
<p>The upper reaches of the Yangtze River have long been a golden waterway in China's inland navigation routes. In recent years, British, Japanese, and American merchants have taken advantage of China's turbulent times and invested heavily in seeking a monopoly on navigation rights in the Sichuan River. Consequently, companies like Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, and China Navigation Company have competed to build new ships to squeeze out Chinese vessels. In the past two years, Chinese ships on the upper Yangtze have been almost completely driven out by foreign ships, and the only remaining ships are the three vessels of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which are struggling to survive the economic aggression of foreign merchants. In order to salvage navigation rights on the upper Yangtze, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has begun to join forces with the Sichuan River shipping industry to actively fight against foreign ships, taking the lead in breaking the invasion of foreign ships in inland waterways. The following is a detailed account of what we know:</p>
<p>The Influence of Foreign Ships on the Upper Yangtze: The navigation routes on the upper Yangtze are traditionally divided into three lines, namely the Wuhan-Yichang-Chongqing and Xiangtan lines. According to regulations, goods from Shanghai could not be directly loaded but had to be transferred between ports. Since last year, British, Japanese, and American shipping companies in Shanghai have connected the three lines of the upper Yangtze into one, creating direct routes from Shanghai to Yichang and Shanghai to Chongqing. As a result, the number of foreign ships on the upper Yangtze has increased daily. The four companies, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, and China Navigation Company, alone have 43 ships. In the past two years, foreign merchants have almost completely controlled navigation on the upper Yangtze, leaving no room for Chinese shipping companies. Currently, there are at least five foreign ships sailing from Shanghai to Yichang every week, and at least two to Chongqing, while there is not a single Chinese ship.</p>
<p>Failed Attempts at Chinese Shipping Companies Joining Forces: In the summer and autumn of the year before last, Chinese shipping merchants from Yichang and Chongqing sent representatives to Shanghai to contact the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other bureaus to organize a joint-stock company for Chinese ships on the Sichuan River. At that time, seven shipping bureaus with a total of eleven ships joined, with the aim of competing with foreign merchants. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also sent representatives to Yichang to preside over the matter. However, as the discussions were underway, military operations broke out and the ships were requisitioned for military use, causing the joint-stock company to halt indefinitely. As a result, the occupation of the upper Yangtze transportation by foreign merchants has caused losses of millions of dollars over the past two years.</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Begins Competition: Now that the war has ended and the ships have been returned, the upper Yangtze transportation has resumed. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has decided to start preparations to recover navigation rights on the upper Yangtze immediately. The branch manager in Hankou and the United Association of Chinese Shipping Industries in Yichang, Sichuan River are consulting on competing for the transportation of commercial goods on the upper reaches and expanding the plan for Chinese ships on the upper Yangtze. The bureau has specially appointed Lin Jingshi and Wang Lisong to discuss the implementation procedures with Zeng Yuming and Zhu Biqian of the Shipping Association. It has been agreed that the association will be fully responsible for the transportation of goods unloaded in Chongqing and Yichang, while the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will undertake the transportation of goods loaded in Shanghai and Hankou. First, the goods will be loaded in sections, with the Changjiang, Kuaili, Emei, Liji, Changde, and other ships operating in conjunction. Once the effectiveness is evident, dedicated ships will be dispatched directly.</p>
<p>Adding New Ships: The cooperation agreement between the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Sichuan Navigation Association to develop business on the upper reaches has been signed. Regarding the upper Yangtze, the agreement stipulates that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Association will each assign responsible personnel to manage it. If the Sichuan River cargo business is congested, the Jiangda, Jiangjing, and other ships with smaller drafts can be transferred to the Shanghai-Yichang route. At the same time, the four new ships ordered by the bureau will be completed ahead of schedule to be added as regular ships operating on the Yichang, Shashi, and Changsha routes. In addition, a large number of iron barges will be built to assist in the upstream and downstream transportation of goods.</p>
<p>Investigation of Existing Commercial Ships: Currently, there are only three Chinese ships on the upper Yangtze from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Wuxing and Fuyang of the Sanbei Company. British Butterfield &amp; Swire has 14 ships, Jardine Matheson has 11 ships, Nisshin Kisen Kaisha has 12 ships, and China Navigation Company has 8 ships. In addition, Asiatic Petroleum Company and Socony-Vacuum Corporation also have seven or eight ships. After all the Yangtze River ships of the Sanbei Company are returned, four more ships can be added to operate on the Sichuan River starting next month.</p>
<p>Java-China-Japan Lijn Apologizes to Various Groups</p>
<h3>Regarding the Xiao Case</h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation Asks Them to Apologize to All Chinese People</p>
<p>After the major case of the Java-China-Japan Lijn (JCJL) ship "Tjibaenoeran" second mate forcibly assaulting Chinese teacher Xiao Xin'an occurred, the local Overseas Chinese Federation immediately telegraphed various sectors calling for them to resist all ships of the JCJL. This call received unanimous support both at home and abroad. The Xiamen Seamen's Union was the first to implement the boycott, and Shanghai, as the center of the people's movement, provided especially enthusiastic assistance. The Shanghai manager of JCJL, Ge Liai, in order to salvage business, sent Chinese manager Qian Chongfu to visit Xu Jigong and Lin Youren of the Overseas Chinese Federation yesterday afternoon. Xu and Lin initially did not want to meet, but later decided that since negotiations required both sides to meet, it would be fine. Xu and Lin then inquired about the company's attitude towards the Xiao case. Qian replied that the company was extremely apologetic about this matter. The first mate had indeed been dismissed, and the second mate, captain, and ship doctor had all been demoted or transferred. The company hoped that the Federation would set aside political issues and seek external negotiations on the Xiao case. The company would apologize to various groups. Lin said that if the company wished to admit its mistake and apologize, it must apologize to all Chinese people, because this matter was not a private matter for Ms. Xiao Xin'an, nor was it a private matter for the various groups assisting her. It was a public matter for the entire Chinese nation and could even be called a public matter for all mankind. The entire Chinese nation did not want to hear about its female compatriots being insulted by Dutch crew members, and women around the world who boarded JCJL ships would certainly not want to risk being insulted by Dutch crew members who harbored criminals and rapists. If JCJL knew its mistake, it should expand the scope of its apology and publish it in Chinese and Western languages in all Chinese and Western newspapers throughout China and in newspapers in all major ports around the world with a Chinese presence. This would slightly reduce the public anger of Chinese people and people of other countries around the world. As for what measures various sectors would take regarding the Xiao case after JCJL published its apology, the Federation would first gather public opinion from various sectors. Because the Federation and various sectors unanimously advocated boycotting JCJL ships, this boycott would only be stopped after the Tjibaenoeran first and second mates were severely punished, the Dutch government officially apologized to the Chinese nation, all kinds of harsh and cruel laws and regulations that abused overseas Chinese in the Dutch colonies were abolished, and it was guaranteed that similar incidents would never happen again, and Ms. Xiao personally received adequate compensation. Anyone who violated this would be decided by a general assembly of various sectors, and no group could independently advocate otherwise. Xu also said to Qian that as a Chinese person, you must love China. If negotiations did not go smoothly in the future, you must stand on the side of the Chinese and fight to the end with the Dutch. Qian replied, "Of course, of course," and then left directly.</p>
<p>The Xiao Clan Support Association Resolved Yesterday That Each Member Must Hold a Specific Position and Carry Out Support Activities Separately. The Resolved Methods and Objectives are Listed Separately Below: Methods: (1) Request the Yixing Fellow Associations of Various Schools to Vigorously Promote the Issue to the School Authorities, and then Have the Students of Various Schools Promote It to the Various Organizations and the Public in the Localities Where the Schools are Located to Attract the Attention of Compatriots Across the Country. (2) Request People Across the Country Not to Serve in the Various Organizations Established by the Dutch Empire, and Warn He Jinrong Against Fabricating Falsehoods and Willingly Defending the Dutch Side, Ignoring Public Anger. Objectives: (1) Dutch Commercial Ships are Not Allowed to Operate in Chinese Ports. (2) The First Mate Should be Sentenced to Imprisonment, and the Second Mate Must Also be Punished. Dismissal is Not Enough. The Methods Discussed by Other Support Associations Should Also Be Carried Out. The Condolence Telegram Sent by the Association to Ms. Xiao is Recorded Below: To Ms. Xiao Xin'an: We Read in Shanghai Newspapers a Month Ago That You Went to Teach in Nanyang With Enthusiasm, but Unexpectedly Encountered Disaster on the Way. All of Our Clan Members Were Extremely Saddened When We Heard This, and Compatriots Across the Country Were Even More Indignant. You Took Education as Your Ambition and Did Not Hesitate to Cross the Ocean Again and Again, Suffering Greatly From the Hardships of Travel. Now That You Have Encountered Unexpected Disaster, People in Distress Naturally Feel the Vicissitudes of Life and the Pain in Their Hearts. However, This Disaster From Beyond the Sky Cannot be Predicted by Human Power. How Can the Obstacles Encountered in Life be Explained by Ordinary Theories of Fortune? Ms. Xiao Need Not be Too Sad. How Can This Strange Disaster From Beyond the Sky Harm Ms. Xiao's Chastity and Conduct? Please Strive to Achieve Your Ambitions, Seek Welfare for Children, and Seek Brilliance for the Education Sector. This is Not Only the Fortune of Tens of Thousands of School-Age Children, But Also the Sincere Hope of Our Entire Clan and Compatriots Across the Country. Our Yixing Xiao Clan Has a Good Reputation, and There Are Quite a Few Who Have Established Themselves Abroad, Especially Women. The Entire Clan Eagerly Awaits Women to Labor for Society, and No One is More Worthy Than Ms. Xiao. Please Do Not Worry About Your Future, Cherish Yourself, and You Will Surely Have Hope in the Future. The Comrades Originally Intended to Organize a Support Association Earlier to Avenge This Strange Humiliation, But They Have Been Delayed Until Now Due to Schoolwork and Professional Duties. The Organization Has Now Been Established. We Hope That You Will Not Blame Us for Being Bystanders. The Comrades Have Notified All Members of Our Clan in Yixing to Cooperate and Carry Out Promotion Separately. A Liaison Office Has Been Set Up in Shanghai at the Faculty of Law on Jiangwan Road to Contact the Support Associations in Shanghai and Announce It to the Country, Seeking Assistance. The First Declaration Has Also Been Sent Separately to Domestic and Foreign Newspapers, and There Are Also News Submissions From All. The Second Declaration is Being Drafted and Will Be Seen Soon. The Comrades are Doing Their Best to Support Ms. Xiao, Not Caring About Labor or Time.</p>
<p>I Deeply Hope That You Will Protect Your Health and Not Be Affected by the Autumn Chill. This is to Express Our Deepest Concern and to Ask You to Inform Us of Your Recent Situation as Soon as Possible. Respectfully Requesting Guidance, Xiao Li, Xiao Kai, Xiao Xu, Xiao Hui, Xiao Zhaokang, et al.</p>

<h3>The Overseas Chinese Federation Warmly Assists Feng Hanyue After Being Expelled and Returning to China</h3>
<p>Will Accompany Him to the City Party Headquarters Tomorrow to Report</p>
<p>After Feng Hanyue, the principal of the Zhongshan Public School in Makassar, Dutch East Indies, was unreasonably expelled and returned to China, the details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, Mr. Feng brought a letter to the Overseas Chinese Federation to report everything. The acting chairman of the Federation, Xu Jigong, and standing committee member Lin Youren, received him. Xu and Lin were extremely indignant about this matter, as the Dutch had abused our overseas Chinese countless times, and the majority of our Chinese people remained silent. This time, Mr. Feng's expulsion and return to Shanghai was particularly egregious. If this was not negotiated, the Chinese in the Dutch East Indies would inevitably feel that everyone was in danger. Therefore, they decided to convene a meeting of members within a few days to discuss measures and immediately organize a diplomatic support association for the Netherlands to jointly handle Mr. Feng's expulsion and Ms. Xiao Xin'an's humiliation. They also decided to accompany Mr. Feng to the City Party Headquarters tomorrow to report everything. The document submitted by the Makassar Party Headquarters to the Central Executive Committee, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is compiled below.</p>
<h3>Submission to the Central Executive Committee and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee Regarding the Transfer of the Submission</h3>
<p>It is Now Reported That Feng Hanyue, the Principal of Zhongshan Public School, Submitted a Report Stating That He Was Dedicated to the Party School and Expelled From the Country, Requesting That the Report Be Transferred to the Central Government for Review and Granted Preferential Treatment After Returning to China. Feng Hanyue Was Appointed by Ding Weifen, the Minister of Training of the Central Executive Committee, on February 4 of Last Year to Serve as the Principal of Zhongshan Public School in Makassar. After That, He Immediately Prepared to Go South to Makassar. After Arriving, All Facilities in the School Adhered to the Party's Ideals. Unexpectedly, in July of This Year, the Chief of the Local Government Police Department and the Director of the Political Department Suddenly Arrived at the School by Car to Investigate. They Inspected the Classrooms, Library, and Students' Literary Works One by One. Two Days Later, the Chief of the Police Department and the Head of the Political Department, Accompanied by a Photographer, Came to the School Again and Removed All the Portraits of Sun Yat-sen, Slogans, Sayings and Writings on the Party Posted by the Central Executive Committee, and Various Writings About the Party Hanging in the Classrooms and Corridors, a Total of More Than 20 Sheets. A Week Later, the Police Department Summoned Feng Hanyue for Questioning, Which Lasted for Ten Hours From Morning to Night. Two Days Later, He Was Summoned Again, and the Interrogation Was Repeated in Great Detail, Deeming That Feng Hanyue's Teaching of the Three Principles of the People and English in the Industrial and Commercial Night School Was Not in Accordance With Local Laws and Sentenced Him to Four Days of Detention. Although a Lawyer Was Hired to Petition the Governor to Waive the Sentence or Reduce the Fine, It Was Ineffective. After the Governor's Office Replied, Feng Hanyue Was Secretly Summoned to the Police Station and Sent to Prison in a Prisoner's Car to Serve His Sentence. The Local Government Believed That the Internal Facilities and Teaching of Zhongshan Public School Were Promoting Party Ideology and Imparting Politics, So It Took Resolute Measures to Stop Feng Hanyue's Teaching Position and Announced That He Was No Longer Allowed to Teach at Zhongshan School. Although Various Efforts Were Made, They Were Ultimately Ineffective. Afterwards, the Investigation Became More Stringent, and the Summonses Became More Frequent, and Each of the Teachers in the School Was Also Summoned for Questioning, Which Was Extremely Troublesome. Feng Hanyue Was Summoned to the Police Station for Questioning More Than 20 Times Because of This. In These Four Months, He Was First Warned, Then Suspended From Teaching, and Finally Imprisoned. Now, He Was Announced Without Reason to Be Expelled Within the Nearest Shipping Period. A Week Before the Expulsion (on the 2nd of This Month), the Local Government Summoned Him for Questioning and Did Not Announce the Reason. Feng Hanyue Was Led Into Another Room and Asked to Print Fingerprints With Both Hands, a Total of Ten Sets, Each Finger in Each Set Was Printed One by One, and His Height Was Measured. Feng Hanyue Requested to Sign Instead of Fingerprints, But the Police Department Did Not Allow It. Afterwards, He Was Photographed in the Prisoner's Room. At 8 AM on the 10th of This Month, the Local Government Came Again to Summon Him and Announced That He Must Leave the Country on the 13th, Suffering Extreme Insult. It Is Truly Difficult to Endure If We Do Not Submit a Request to the Central Government to Negotiate a Solution. The Future of Overseas Education is Truly in Danger. Overseas Comrades Work Hard for the Party and Suffer the Abuse of Foreign Governments. If We Do Not Provide Preferential Treatment, How Can We Encourage the Efforts of Those Who Come Later to Work for the Party Overseas? We Urgently Request That the Central Party Headquarters Provide Preferential Treatment in Order to Enable Feng Hanyue's True Spirit of Loving the Party and Protecting the Country to Find a Place to Entrust. It is for Public and Private Convenience. Respectfully Submitted to the Training Department of the Central Executive Committee, Standing Committee of the Executive Committee of the Makassar Branch, Guan Weixin, October 11, Year 19.</p>
<p>Submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Requesting Strict Negotiations to Draft Measures to Present Serious Negotiations to the Governor and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in The Hague to Benefit Party Affairs and Protect Overseas Chinese Affairs. Since the Opening of Our Department, Party Members in This and Other Ports Have Reached More Than 1,600, and We Have Established a Party School, Zhongshan Public School, and Minsheng Chinese Newspaper. We Have Worked Hard to Earn the Support of Overseas Chinese and Maintain It With the Help of Comrades for Several Years. Since Feng Hanyue Was Appointed Principal of Zhongshan Public School by the Training Department of the Central Executive Committee Last Year, the School's Affairs Have Improved Daily, and the Number of Students in the School Has Increased to More Than 380. Since Minsheng Newspaper Recovered the Minsheng Printing Company This Year, We Have Added Printing Presses and Expanded the Format. Chen Guanqun, Introduced by the Propaganda Department of the Central Party Headquarters, Came to Preside Over the Editing, Which is Also in Progress. Unexpectedly, the Government in the Dutch East Indies Has Recently Increased the Pressure. In July of This Year, It Expelled Editor-in-Chief Liao Peizhi Without Announcing a Reason. Pan Fengjing, a Female Teacher at Zhongshan Public School, Was Also Sentenced to Expulsion Before She Had Been There for a Month. Feng Hanyue, Principal of Zhongshan Public School, Was Suspected of Teaching the Three Principles of the People and Having Party Ideology Facilities and Courses in the School, and Was Warned, Suspended From Teaching, Imprisoned, and Now Expelled Without Announcing a Reason. Chen Guanqun, Introduced by the Propaganda Department of the Central Party Headquarters, Was Summoned by the Police Department Just One Day After Landing and Detained Without Reason, and Is Now Limited to Leaving the Country on the Nearest Shipping Period. The Responsible Comrades of the School and Newspaper Have Been Expelled One After Another, and Our Department Has Become a Disintegrated Situation. If We Do Not Take Serious Negotiation Measures, Not Only Will There Be No Hope for the Development of Overseas Party Affairs, But Also the Cultural Undertakings of Overseas Chinese Will Be Eliminated, and the Suffering of Overseas Chinese Will Not Be Relieved. The Prospect is Unthinkable. We Hope That You Will Draft Measures to Present Serious Negotiations to the Governor and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in The Hague to Prevent This Unjustified Expulsion Order From Happening Again, Which Will Be the Fortune of Overseas Chinese and the Glory of China. In Addition to Feng Hanyue's Personal Presentation of the Oppression of Each Comrade and Submission of Opinions, We Specially Request Wang, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government.</p>
<p>Mr. Feng's Letter to the Overseas Chinese Federation Respectfully States: Since Feng Hanyue Was Appointed Principal of Zhongshan Public School in Makassar, Dutch East Indies, by the Training Department of the Central Party Headquarters in February of Last Year, He Has Tried His Best in Overseas Education. Because Zhongshan Public School Was Founded by the Makassar Branch of the Kuomintang, He Implemented Party-Oriented Education in the School in Accordance With the Latest Ideas on Overseas Education. Unexpectedly, in Recent Months, the Colonial Government of the Dutch Empire Has Strictly Banned the School Due to the Text Case of the Party Department's Industrial and Commercial Remedial School and the Propaganda Items Issued by the Central Party Department Posted in Zhongshan School. The Colonial Government Believed That Han Yue Was Politically Suspicious and First Suspended Him From Teaching and Prohibited Him From Teaching the Three Principles of the People and Speaking in Public Places. He Was Then Arrested and Imprisoned, and After Being Released From Prison, He Was Severely Monitored and Limited to Leaving the Country on the Nearest Shipping Period, Never to Return to the Dutch Colonies. However, the Implementation of Party Ideology in Overseas Education Did Not Violate Local Laws, and the Reason for Expulsion Was Not Announced. Such Arbitrary Detention and Expulsion Is Truly Unreasonable and Oppressive. Moreover, Those in Charge of Handling Party Affairs and Overseas Education in the Dutch East Indies Who Have Been Expelled by the Dutch Colonial Government Have Been Expelled From the Country From Time to Time. Overseas Chinese Who Have Been Oppressed and Occasionally Express Their Opinions in Chinese Newspapers Are Subject to Various Forms of Destruction and Abuse. Overseas Chinese Endure Silently, Which Is Truly Painful. Your Association Was Established to Seek the Interests of Overseas Chinese. We Hope That You Will Find Ways to Provide Relief and Propose Measures to Be Submitted to the National Government for Discussion and Delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Present Serious Negotiations and Promptly Prepare to Revise the Sino-Dutch Treaty to Relieve the Plight of Overseas Chinese and Rescue Millions of Overseas Chinese in Nanyang From Their Suffering. This Would Be a Great Blessing. Respectfully Submitted to the Executive Committee of the Overseas Chinese Federation, Feng Hanyue, Principal of Zhongshan Public School in Makassar.</p>
<p>[The Nanyang Inspection Group Set Off Yesterday&gt;</p>
<p>The Cheerfully Sending-Off of National Products Comrades</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Federation Specially Formed a Nanyang Islands Inspection Group for the Purpose of Promoting Overseas Trade, So That They Could Carry Samples to Promote Sales. The Members of Each Group Set Off Yesterday (Saturday). At 11 AM, the Shanghai National Products Factory Federation and Other Groups Held Flags and Went to the North Bund Wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Cheerfully Send Them Off.</p>

<p>Led by Ye Youcai, the Head of the Group, and the Liaison Officer, Document Officer, and Finance Committee Members Yuan Zongyao, Zhang Lingzhou, Lu Yifei, and He Zijing, Lu Xingzhuang, Fang Jiange, Sun Jiren, Sun Fuji, Jiang Zhonghe, Shen Mengshi, Ma Jisheng, and Others Held a Meeting in Daronjian. After Mr. Lu and Others Gave Speeches of Praise, Mr. Ye Stood Up to Thank Them. The Inspection Locations Include Singapore, Saigon, Hong Kong, Java, Penang, Zhiluo, Bangkok, Batavia, Sumatra, Deli, and Medan. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Has Directly Ordered the Consulates and Chinese Chambers of Commerce in Each of These Locations to Investigate.</p>
<h3>Yang Shuzhuang Will Enter Beijing Tonight</h3>
<p>After Yang Shuzhuang, the Minister of the Navy, and Zheng Baojing, a Commissioner of Fujian Province, and Others Came to Shanghai, It Was Heard That Mr. Yang Was Preparing to Take a Train to Beijing Tonight to Attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. It Is Said That Zheng Baojing, Cheng Shizhui, Xu Xianshi, and Others Are Waiting for Lin Zhiyuan to Arrive in Shanghai Before Proceeding.</p>
<h3>Yang Hucheng's Representative Returned to the Capital Last Night</h3>
<p>Hu Yimin, the Representative of the 17th Route Army Headquarters in Beijing, Was Previously Ordered by Commander-in-Chief Jiang to Reward the Various Divisions of Yang Hucheng's 7th Army at the Front Line. He Has Now Completed His Mission and Returned to Beijing. He Came to Shanghai to Visit Commander-in-Chief Chiang in Fenghua to Report His Mission. He Was Also Tasked by Chairman Yang Hucheng to Purchase Ten Trucks in Shanghai for the Transportation of Military Supplies and Ordnance on the 400-Li Land Route Between Bili and Lingbao to Xi'an. He Has Now Designated Dodge Brand Cars and Has Sent the Price and Form to Shaanxi for Instructions. According to Mr. Hu, a Reporter From the Guowenshe News Agency Said That the Report That Zhong Chuheng Came to Shanghai to Order Cars Was Actually Erroneous, Because Mr. Zhong Was Not the Brigade Commander of the 7th Army, But an Officer in the Independent 4th Division Under Yan Deji. As for the Purchase of Cars, It Was Purchased by Li Ziguang, the Army's Representative in Hankou. This Time, the Entry of Our Army Into Shaanxi Was Extremely Smooth. The Saying That Favorable Times, Geographical Advantages, and Popular Support Are Necessary Cannot Be Fully Believed, But There Are Similar Circumstances. There Has Been No Rain in Qin for Many Years, and After the Feng Army Entered Tongguan, All Places Received Abundant Rainfall and Three Days of Continuous Rain. There Are Also Two Major Reasons for the Rapid Defeat of Feng's Troops This Time: One is That the Military's Morale Was Poor, and Most of the Soldiers From Henan and Shandong Left the Army and Returned to Their Hometowns, While Those From Shaanxi Turned Against Feng and Welcomed Yang. Second, the People in Various Places Gave Commander-in-Chief Yang a Warm Welcome and Assisted in the Movement. This is Why Liu Yufen and Others Were Unable to Clean Up This Residual Situation. He Also Said That He Originally Intended to Go to Fenghua, But Because Commander-in-Chief Chiang Had Already Left Ningbo, and He Had Completed His Work in Shanghai, He Would Return to the Capital Tonight (Yesterday) to Await Commander-in-Chief Chiang's Orders.</p>
<h3>The French Ambassador Will Enter Beijing Soon to Meet Chiang</h3>

<p>Before the French Ambassador to China, Wei Lide, Went South to Beijing to Meet Chairman Chiang and Present His Credentials, He Sent Counselor Shayef to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Contact Him About the Date of Chairman Chiang's Audience. It Is Now Heard That the Ministry Has Telegraphed Wei Sometime Ago That the Presentation of Credentials Can Be Held After Chairman Chiang Returns to Beijing. A Reporter From the Xinsheng News Agency Met With Diao Minqian, the Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Yesterday and Talked About That Chairman Chiang Can Return to Beijing Ten Days Ago, But Because of the Fatigue of the Journey, He May Not Be Able to Receive the Audience on the 11th. The 12th is Sun Yat-sen's Birthday, and It is Expected That the Presentation of Credentials Can Be Held on the Morning of the 13th or 14th. Another News: Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting Arrived in Shanghai From Beijing Last Night and Arrived at the North Station This Morning.

<h3>The County Finance Bureau Investigates the Yatie During the Peak Season</h3>
<p>Wang, the Director of the Shanghai County Finance Bureau, Said That Now is the Peak Season, and Cotton Has Been Marketed, and All Businesses Have Started Weighing.

<h3>Requesting Exemption from Stamp Duty for License Receipts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai South Office of the Municipal Tobacco and Liquor Dealers Association sent a letter to the Executive Committee yesterday, stating that they had recently received a letter from member Xiangcheng Hao of Sipailou, saying that on October 10th, they paid the winter tobacco Class C license tax of two yuan in foreign currency at the Jiangsu Second District Jin District Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office, along with a surtax of 6.4 jiao in foreign currency for the 19th-year short-term customs treasury bonds, as per regulations. However, the office only issued temporary receipts for both the license and the treasury bonds, stating that the license would only be issued after the business tax amount was verified and that the treasury bonds could only be exchanged after the association compiled them into whole numbers. Therefore, the receipts were taken back for safekeeping. On the afternoon of the 7th of this month at around 2 PM, personnel from the Stamp Tax Bureau, accompanied by police, came to the store for inspection. The receipts were presented for inspection, but the officer detained the receipts, considering it a tax evasion. However, the stamp duty on the license itself had already been paid as required. The receipt was only a confirmation of the exchange for the license, so no stamp duty was affixed. The detention by the inspector was a misunderstanding. Therefore, they specifically requested the Executive Committee to verify the situation and request a waiver to avoid penalties, to demonstrate compassion, and to ensure the stable operation and livelihood of the business. Upon receiving the letter, the Executive Committee immediately dispatched personnel to investigate and confirmed that it was indeed a misunderstanding by the inspector. They have submitted a detailed report to the Executive Committee, hoping that the Executive Committee will review and implement it, which would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Authorization Will be Granted to the Bureau of Public Works for Execution</p>
<p>However, the Method Will Not Be Announced Temporarily</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the Police Committee of the Bureau of Public Works convened a meeting on Thursday of this week to consider the issue of banning gambling within the Settlement, with particular focus on dog racing gambling.

It is reported that the Board of Directors will hold a meeting next Wednesday to discuss the matter, and a resolution is expected to be reached on that day. The Police Committee's proposals have not yet been released, but with the strong advocacy of banning gambling by Chief of Police, Mr. E.W. Everson, and the unwavering support of the British and Japanese Consuls, the Police Committee has approved the ban of all forms of gambling in the Settlement. It is said that Mr. Everson also attended Thursday's meeting, along with Mr. Fessenden, Mr. Hubbard, Mr. Fukushima, and two Chinese directors. If the Board of Directors decides to close the dog racing track at its meeting next Wednesday, there will certainly be effective measures. It is said that British officials and legal institutions in the city are planning to lend their full support. It is expected that the two Japanese directors and five Chinese directors on the Board of Directors will oppose the continued operation of the dog racing track during the voting process, while other directors may express sympathy. If the closure of the dog racing track can be decided at the next meeting, the Bureau of Public Works will be authorized to implement the ban with the necessary methods. As for the specific methods of enforcement, inquiries to officials of the Bureau of Public Works yesterday yielded no information due to a desire not to reveal the nature of the plan.</p>
<p>Case of Mother and Daughter Hanging Themselves</p>
<h3>Record of Interrogation of Liu Yingzhou</h3>
<p>Prosecutor Indicts for Abandonment</p>
<p>During Interrogation, Liu Still Tries to Deny Everything</p>
<p>Closing Arguments Concluded Yesterday; Verdict Awaited</p>
<p>In the case of Liu Zhou-shi, the wife of Liu Yingzhou, a native of Dongting Mountain, and their daughter, Yun'e, who hanged themselves at No. 6 Maoxing Lane, Fumin Road, Liu Yingzhou was sued by Zhou Qifeng, Zhou-shi's brother. After investigation, the prosecutor concluded the case and filed a public indictment against Liu Yingzhou for abandonment under Article 310 of the criminal law. The trial was held yesterday morning at 10 a.m. by Judge Zhao Yongzhou. Liu Yingzhou testified that he was 35 years old, a native of Dongshan, Dongting, and engaged in the silk and satin business. Liu Zhou-shi was his legal wife, 36 years old, and Liu Yun'e was his daughter, 11 years old. He had been married for 14 years and only had this daughter. He also had a concubine, Yu-shi, for 10 years, who had borne him a son who had since died. His wife usually lived in their hometown, while his concubine lived in Dadongmen. Zhou-shi came to Shanghai last March and again in May, but he sent her back to the countryside both times. In August, she came to Shanghai again, first staying at Qiaojia Bang Xundao Street. Yun'e lived with her mother, and the monthly rent was 8 yuan, 5 dou of rice, and another 15 yuan for other expenses. She liked to play mahjong and was unreasonable. She was once arrested for playing mahjong by the police of a certain district and was bailed out by him. Less than three days after he visited her, the landlord came to inform him that she had swallowed a gold ring and was sent to Qu Zhibu Hospital on August 28th (lunar calendar). Seven days later, she was discharged from the hospital. Three days later, she swallowed another gold ring and was sent to the same hospital. The doctor said it was a scare tactic and there was no sign that she had actually swallowed anything. Therefore, he asked the hospital to let the mother and daughter stay for a few more days because Yun'e had also swallowed a gold ring, and he was busy and unable to stay with them. More than ten days later, because he could not live in peace and do business, he hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the civil court, requesting a separation and was willing to pay alimony in court. The court hearing was scheduled for October 24th, and the summons was delivered on the 21st. She had already been discharged from the hospital because she was causing trouble in the hospital and had a nervous breakdown. However, he did not know that she had been discharged. On the 22nd, she and her daughter hanged themselves. He did not know until 9 p.m. when her brother came to find him. Zhou Qifeng testified that he was 31 years old, a native of Dongting Mountain, and worked as a partner in the Jinlun Silk Factory. Liu Zhou-shi was his elder sister, and Yun'e was his niece. The two of them hanged themselves on October 22nd, and no one informed him. Two days before her death, she went to his cousin's house and said that the weather was cold and no one was sending her clothes, so she left the hospital and said that life was bitter and she would rather go home. She said that she would be back tomorrow. He told her she should say goodbye to her mother-in-law and husband, but she said that she would be back in a week. Therefore, they sent her to her mother-in-law, but the mother-in-law refused to take her in. The next day, she brought the copy of Liu Yingzhou's lawsuit and cried. He advised her, but she said that her husband had framed her in the mahjong game and was now going to sue her. However, Liu knew that she was playing mahjong and did not dissuade her. The fine was paid by him. However, in August of last year, his sister was living on Xundao Street when she lost a front tooth. He went to negotiate, and the defendant wrote a statement promising 18 yuan a month for his sister's living expenses, but he did not fulfill this. So, this spring, she came again, first living at Hongqiao Tou, but she could not make ends meet, so she took red-headed matches in April. Now she died at No. 6 Maoxing Lane. She often lived by borrowing clothes and money. In total, she attempted suicide four times. The summons was the last straw. At this point, it was already noon, and the judge ordered a recess until 2 p.m. for the trial to continue. Witness Weng Zilin testified that he was 43 years old, a native of Dongting Mountain, and worked at He Hengchang Silk Store in Xiaodongmen. Liu Yingzhou was his cousin, and Zhou Qifeng's side was his wife's family. The fine for the deceased playing mahjong was 20 yuan. Liu Yingzhou gave him 20 yuan, and Zhou Qifeng gave him 5 yuan to pay. He did not know about the gold swallowing or hanging. Landlord Cheng Wu-xiu testified that she was 24 years old and lived at No. 6 Maoxing Lane. When Liu Zhou-shi hanged herself, she accompanied her mother to the Wing On Company. She only found out when she returned home in the evening. She did not know why she died and had never said anything to her. Neighbor Weng Yanling testified that he was 39 years old, a native of Ningbo, and lived at No. 2 Maoxing Lane. He did not know about the affairs inside No. 6. He was often away doing business. Later, because no one claimed the body, Zhang from the soy sauce shop and his wife made a public statement. However, he himself did not understand. Wang Zhige testified that he was 32 years old, a native of Nanxiang, and traded in silk and satin in Tanzi Lane. Liu Yingzhou was a friend. He had advised Liu Zhou-shi when she swallowed the gold ring. He did not know whether the couple was doing well. Of course, Liu provided the monthly living expenses. At this point, Prosecutor Wu Shixin presented his closing arguments, stating that the defendant's abandonment of his wife and daughter led to their suicide. The plaintiff's testimony was clear, and the prosecutor had also conducted a very detailed investigation. He requested that the court rule in accordance with the indictment. The defendant's defense lawyer claimed that abandonment only applies to those who are unable to support themselves. The deceased were not unable to live and their livelihood had not been cut off, so he requested that the court declare the defendant not guilty. The judge concluded the debate and scheduled the verdict for next Tuesday, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<p>A Woman's Cruelty</p>
<h3>Using a Fire Tongs to Scald Her Maid</h3>
<p>Min Mei-shi Cannot Escape the Law</p>
<p>Sentenced to Seven Months in Prison</p>
<p>Min Mei-shi, a woman from Huzhou residing at No. 1273 Xinzha Road, is 67 years old and very violent. She often abused her 14-year-old maid, Zhang Lanxiang, who is from Changzhou. At around 2 p.m. the day before yesterday, she used the pretext of an offense to severely beat Zhang, and then used fire tongs to scald her waist, causing her to cry out in pain and run away. She fled to the residence of Zhang Tang-shi, a maid at No. 35 Anle Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, and told her the story, asking for help. Zhang helped Zhang send Zhang to the Ji Liang Institute, which then transferred her to the Xinzha Police Station. After questioning her, the head of the police station learned the details and immediately ordered Bao Tan Gao Yanrong to arrest Min Mei-shi and detain her at the police station. Zhang was sent to Renji Hospital for an examination, which confirmed that she had been injured. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District District Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer for the police station, stated the case and said that the police station was accusing the defendant, Min Mei-shi, of committing crimes under Article 294 of the criminal law for inflicting serious injury that could cause death. However, it was now necessary to add charges under Article 313 of the criminal law for obstructing freedom and enslaving a person. Zhang Tang-shi, a witness, testified that the defendant used to live at No. 33 Anle Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, so they knew each other. Yesterday afternoon, Zhang Lanxiang suddenly came to her place, crying and saying that she had been abused and scalded by her mistress and refused to go back. She had no choice but to send her to the Ji Liang Institute. The maid, Zhang Lanxiang, testified that she had been scalded by the defendant with fire tongs. Judge Wu Tingqi examined her in court and confirmed that there were injuries on her face and waist. The defendant claimed that she had bought the girl for 100 yuan when she was 10 years old to be her adopted daughter. Yesterday, she had slightly beaten her, but she did not scald her with fire tongs. She also hired a lawyer to defend her. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Wu announced in court that the defendant, Min Mei-shi, was sentenced to seven months in prison, and Zhang Lanxiang was sent to the Ji Liang Institute for care.</p>
<p>Russian Women Dispute Over Fur Coat</p>
<h3>A Fur Coat Seen in a Clothing Store</h3>
<p>One Woman Takes Out Fur Lining as Proof</p>
<p>One Woman Says it is Her Wedding Dress</p>
<p>Each Has Witnesses; Difficult to Determine the Truth</p>
<p>On the night of the 31st of last month, the Kunshan Road residence of Polish woman Berta Bertaev was burglarized, with a loss of 1,274 yuan worth of property, including a fur coat worth 850 yuan. The woman subsequently reported the theft to the police station and requested an investigation, but there were no clues at first. The day before yesterday, the victim was passing by the entrance of a clothing store set up by a Russian on Zhaofeng Road No. 28 when she glimpsed a fur coat on display in the store. She went inside to examine it and recognized it as her stolen item. She then went to the Hongkou Police Station to report it. The Western detective, Mr. Smith, was dispatched to the store to investigate its origin. According to the store owner, a Russian woman, Ai Lishi Kofu, residing at No. 13 Tangshan Road, had recently hired a Russian, Sha Kaomeng, residing at No. 20 Huishan Road, to bring it to be made into a new garment. The Western detective then arrested Ai and Sha and brought them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special District District Court along with the stolen goods. Judge Feng Shide conducted the interrogation. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer for the police station, stated that the two defendants were temporarily being prosecuted for receiving stolen goods, and the identity of the thief was still being investigated. He requested an extension and had the victim testify that she had purchased the fur coat years ago and had hidden it in a suitcase when it was stolen. Many other clothes were stolen at the same time, but this coat was the most valuable. Although it had been made into a garment and worn once, it was still not worn out. Questioned, the defendant Ai Lishi Kofu said that the coat was given to her by her mother when she got married in her home country a few years ago. This spring, she came to Shanghai and was wearing this coat when she arrived in Vladivostok, where she encountered rain and the coat got wet. In May, she arrived in Harbin and took the lining off the coat and abandoned it there, bringing the lining to Shanghai. As winter approached, she hired Sha to take the fur lining to the clothing store to be made into a garment. It was not stolen property. However, the victim also brought the lining of the coat to the court and compared it to the fur lining, and it was exactly the same. She also put the fur lining on her body, and it was the right length. Therefore, the victim insisted that it was her stolen item and invited a compatriot tailor, Koute, to the court to testify that the plaintiff had brought the fur lining to his shop years ago and had him make the coat. Ai also invited a witness, a Russian woman, Kao Sigaev, to the court to testify that Ai did encounter heavy rain when she passed through Vladivostok, and the fur coat she was wearing was rained on. When she arrived in Harbin, she parted ways with Ai. Judge Feng ruled that the plaintiff and defendant each held their own views and ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody for further investigation and questioning.</p>
<p>A Tool for Spreading Commercial Information</p>
<h3>Reuters Commercial Intelligence Department</h3>
<p>Imported British "Nimble Report" Machine</p>
<p>More Than Twenty Households Already Using It</p>
<p>The Shanghai Reuters Commercial Intelligence Department specializes in transmitting market price information from overseas and local exchanges. Subscribers to its services, which include banks and commercial firms, call it "nimble" reporting. Recently, the company stated that commercial information changes rapidly and the speed of transmission is crucial. Sending information by manpower takes too much time, so they have imported a type of "Nimble Report" machine (Ticker Machine) from England. All customers who subscribe to commercial information and use this machine can connect to the company's central machine. When the company receives market price information, it is immediately transmitted from the central machine, and all other machines will automatically display the information without any errors. It is a new and nimble method for transmitting commercial market information, hence the name "Nimble Report" machine. Currently, more than twenty Chinese and foreign banks and commercial firms in Shanghai are using this machine.</p>
<p>Municipal Bureau of Public Works Investigates</p>
<h3>Unauthorized Water Supply in Fa Hua Town Beyond Settlement Limits</h3>
<p>Water Pipe Company Digs Road Without a Permit</p>
<p>Fined Ten Yuan According to Regulations</p>
<p>The Yang family at No. 241 Fa Hua Town Road in Shanghai has been using well water for drinking water. Recently, they wanted to switch to tap water and commissioned the Jin Da Water and Electrical Materials Company to install water pipes and reported it to the Shanghai Water Company to connect the water. The Shanghai Water Company then submitted a request for road digging to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, requesting to connect to the main pipe on Columbia Road up to the corner of Yu's Villa. (According to the note, this part is entirely within the road construction area beyond the settlement limits). The</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>procedure was considered in order and the application was forwarded to the Municipal Engineering Bureau for approval. However, the Ninth District Party Department issued a declaration to stop foreigners from supplying water beyond the settlement limits, and the municipal commissioner of the Fa Hua District also submitted a request to the municipal government to negotiate a stop. After receiving the order, the Bureau of Public Works dispatched personnel to investigate and learned that the Jin Da Company had privately sent workers to dig a ditch on the side of Fa Hua Town Road at 11 p.m. on October 15 to bury a one-inch diameter water pipe. The police officers and villagers of the Fa Hua Town Police Station of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau saw this and found out that they did not have a road digging permit for the city, so they stopped the work and filled the dug ditch of more than sixty feet back to its original state. It has not been started again since. The Bureau considers that this case has no relationship with the Bureau of Public Works of the Public Concession and the Shanghai Water Company. However, Jin Da Company's unauthorized digging of the road violates regulations and should be fined ten yuan according to the city's road digging rules. They have already sent a letter ordering compliance.</p>
<h3>Husband's Whereabouts Unknown</h3>
<p>Wife Supported by Her Parents' Family</p>
<p>Now Filing a Lawsuit for Divorce</p>
<p>Sun Honglan, a native of Ningbo, married Fan Meifeng in her hometown in 1920 through a matchmaker. At that time, Fan was only ten years old. After she entered the family, Sun, due to his family's poverty and inability to support his wife, sent Fan to her parents' family to be supported, while he left Ningbo to Shanghai to make a living. However, after arriving in Shanghai, he willingly degenerated. In January 1924, he was charged by the court for impersonating a cigarette tax bureau inspector and committing fraud, and was sentenced to one year in prison. After his release, he returned home and sold his property, and then came to Shanghai again. He was recommended to work in a cigarette factory in Pudong, but soon relapsed and stole goods from the factory and fled. Since then, his whereabouts have been unknown, and he has been living off borrowing and wandering in foreign lands. Fan's mother's family, with many mouths to feed, an elderly mother, and an aging brother, were unable to take care of her. They asked Fan to return to her husband's family to lighten their burden. Fan had no choice but to come to Shanghai to find her husband, but after three years, there was no trace of him. Fan, now in her thirties, is unwilling to wait any longer and hired lawyer Wang Liangqing to file a lawsuit for divorce in the Special District District Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Yi held a hearing. The defendant, Sun Honglan, could not be served because he was said to have joined the army. Judge Yang appointed lawyer Lu Qi as the special agent for the defendant to protect his legal rights. First, Fan Meifeng stated the process that her husband had abandoned her for several years and his whereabouts were now unknown, requesting permission to divorce. Then, the lawyers of both parties debated, and finally, Prosecutor Xu came to court to argue that the reasons stated by the plaintiff for requesting a divorce were in accordance with the law and asked the judge to rule according to law. Judge Yang then announced that the case would be scheduled for sentencing at 10 a.m. on the 14th.</p>
<p>Flower Arrangement Society to Hold</p>
<h3>Grand China Chrysanthemum Exhibition</h3>
<p>Recently, chrysanthemums have been blooming and autumn flowers are competing for beauty. Elegant people and hermits have gatherings for flower viewing. The Shanghai Flower Arrangement Society's chrysanthemum exhibition is scheduled to be held at the Grand China Hotel in West Shanghai on the 12th and 13th. The society is an organization for Chinese and foreign flower lovers. It was established early on, and the first chrysanthemum exhibition was held in 1887.

<h3>Chinese Concession Efforts to Capture Thieves</h3>
<p>In the past two days, the Public Concession, the French Concession Police, and the Chinese Concession Public Security Bureau have cracked down on a large number of major thieves, reaching a total of seventeen people. It is reported that these bandits committed a total of two theft cases, three robbery cases, seventeen street robbery cases, and one assassination case in a location in the French Concession. It is also reported that the shooting of Sun Huanwen, a secret agent of the Water Police Bureau, at No. 10 Baoyu Lane in the French Concession the day before yesterday, was also committed by them because Sun had solved the case of a bandit leader named Wei in Shanghai on the 26th of last month, resulting in his death. Two handguns were seized in the Public Concession. According to the confessions of the criminals, the gang has a total of forty people in Shanghai. The police authorities of the three concessions are stepping up their investigations.</p>
<h3>Walking at Night and Encountering Thieves Who Stripped Clothes</h3>
<p>The Thief Had Already Put the Coat on</p>
<p>The Police Recovered the Stolen Goods After Chasing</p>
<p>Pu Zaiyuan, a 32-year-old man from Suzhou, resides at No. 7 Ziyang Lane, Glock Road, behind the cattle slaughtering company in the French Concession. At around 4 a.m. yesterday morning, Pu was returning home from outside when he was walking through an alley near Ziyang Lane. Suddenly, two robbers appeared, brandishing pistols and threatening him to keep quiet. They stripped off Pu's coat and cotton robe, and fled east along Rue Pichon. Pu then took out a police whistle and blew it wildly, chasing after them. One of the robbers fled to Xiaobeimen and sneaked into the Chinese Concession. The duty officer, Dang Chaoxuan, and neighboring officers Li Fujin and Fu Yunbo of the 15th outpost of the Xiaobeimen Sub-Bureau of the Second District Public Security Bureau, all heard the alarm and rushed to intercept the criminal. At the same time, French Police No. 482 and Vietnam Police No. 383, along with the victim, followed and caught up and brought the criminal to the Second District First Sub-Bureau. A four-inch Browning pistol with live ammunition and one bullet, a coat (already worn by the thief) and eight hundred and fifteen yuan of paper currency and four jiao in change was confiscated from the thief. Also found on the thief were two diaries, a soldier's symbol, a badge, and ten pawn tickets. After a detailed interrogation by Chief Qian, the criminal confessed that his name was Zhao Guankun, a 20-year-old man from Pudong, and admitted that he and his accomplice, Zhang Ziliang, who lived at No. 25 Zhangjia Lane, Xiaonanmen, had committed armed robbery. Chief Qian then ordered Patrol Officer Jiang Chunsong and Qiang Yude, along with Patrol Captain Wang Yufan and Wang Zhongqing, and other police officers, to rush to No. 25 Zhangjia Lane in the First District First Sub-Bureau to search. However, Zhang had already fled to escape punishment and was nowhere to be found. After interrogation, the chief of police transferred the case to the General Bureau for verification.</p>
<h3>Thieves Captured Inside a Restaurant</h3>
<p>One Thief in New Clothes and Shoes with Plenty of Money</p>
<p>On the evening of the day before yesterday (the 6th) at about 7 p.m., Chief Ma of the Second Sub-Bureau of the First District Public Security Bureau received a report from detective Li Dingyuan that Zhong Xiangsheng (nicknamed "Little Amitabha"), the ringleader of the gang who robbed Yuanhe Rice Store on Lima Road, Cuifeng Lane, within the jurisdiction of the First District General Bureau for more than 2,000 yuan on the night of the 1st of this month, had gathered with several accomplices for dinner at the Juyuan Restaurant across from the Little World and requested the dispatch of police to arrest them. Chief Ma immediately ordered Patrol Officers Tang and Wu to lead Patrol Captain Ma Jie, Li Fuyi, and police officers Shi Xunwei, Jia Tinglie, Man Zhaogan, etc. to rush to the scene secretly. The three criminals were arrested on the spot and taken to the station for interrogation. The Zhong suspect stated his name was Xiang, 24 years old, a native of Changzhou, currently residing in Wu Family Lane, Xinshanghai County, and worked as a coppersmith. He denied the nickname "Little Amitabha." The remaining suspects stammered. The other two suspects stated their names as Lu Shouting, 25 years old, a native of Ningbo, residing at No. 142 Anren Bridge and working as a牌作, and Yao Shuangxi, 25 years old, a native of Changzhou, residing upstairs at the Wang Family Stove Coppersmith and engaged in the electroplating business. All denied being accomplices. Chief Ma carefully examined Zhong and found that all his clothes, shoes, and socks were newly purchased, and 111 yuan was found in his pocket. After paying the restaurant bill, there were still 109 yuan remaining. While he was being interrogated, the First District General Bureau had heard the news and sent detectives to the station to take over the case. Under detailed interrogation, the suspect confessed that he had committed the robbery. A six-inch Browning pistol, which he claimed to have falsely borrowed from Jin Sheng of Zhabei, was hidden in the home of Wang, a monk at No. 50 Caojia Street. Detective Lu Anpu and Patrol Captain Cui of the Second Detective Team of the First District Public Security Bureau and Patrol Captain Ma Jie searched the house of Monk Wang at the specified address and found a pistol, but Wang had already fled. In addition to the First District General Bureau sending the criminals to the Judicial Section for verification, the Second Sub-Bureau of the First District had filed a separate report to the Director.</p>
<h3>Wife of a Battalion Commander Wanders Lost</h3>
<p>Guard Suddenly Disappears</p>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai, Bewildered and Helpless</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, around two o'clock, before dawn, a Western detective, 比萊, leading Chinese constables on patrol along Rue de Montauban in the French Concession, near the Small North Gate, noticed a middle-aged woman carrying an infant and a suitcase standing beside the road. She spoke with a Hunan accent and seemed lost and suspicious, so they approached her for questioning. Unable to understand her clearly, they took her to the police station. They opened the suitcase and found only a dozen or so items of clothing and nothing illegal. She stated that her name was Cao Zhang, 25 years old, from Changsha, Hunan. Her husband, Cao Guiheng, is currently the battalion commander of the 5th Company, 2nd Battalion, of the Hangzhou Garrison. A few days ago, her husband sent a guard, Zhang Yuqing, to Hankou to bring Mrs. Zhang to Hangzhou. She arrived in Shanghai by steamer the day before, bringing eight or nine pieces of luggage. However, when the steamer docked, the guard Zhang Yuqing suddenly disappeared. Based on her statement, the police dispatched Detective 比萊 to take Mrs. Zhang, the infant, and the suitcase to the Second District Police Headquarters. After Chief Wang questioned her again, her story remained the same. Chief Wang immediately drafted a quick letter to Hangzhou, ordering her husband to come to Shanghai to claim her. In the meantime, she was sent to the General Bureau for safekeeping, awaiting her husband's arrival.</p>
<h3>Plea Regarding the Tragic Fire at Fuchang</h3>
<p>Regarding the recent tragic fire at the Fuchang Military Uniform Factory on Rue de la République, in which male and female workers were burned to death, as reported in previous issues, it is now heard that the families of the victims believe that the factory should not have locked the iron gates when the fire was discovered. This prevented the workers from escaping, which is unreasonable in terms of both human sentiment and legal principles. Therefore, they have entrusted lawyer Yan Qiangkuai to petition the judicial authorities for legal relief. The full text of the complaint drafted by lawyer Yan is as follows:</p>
<p>To cry out about the tragic deaths and request a lawful investigation, with an order for compensation to provide relief: It is a fact that a fire broke out at the third branch of the Fuchang Military Uniform Factory at the intersection of Rue de la République and Rue Hua Kang in this city at approximately 3:00 PM on November 3rd, resulting in the death of numerous workers. The tragic details have already been examined by your office and placed on file. However, the great sorrow of all the families of the victims is of the utmost importance, and we feel compelled to cry out like Qin Ting. We hereby present the essential facts, highlight the urgency, express our full sentiments, and proclaim our grievances, running about until our voices are hoarse, vowing to obtain legal protection and humane safeguards before resting. We implore your office to show great compassion and grant our request to protect our people. Upon investigation, those who perished include men and women, old and young, fathers and sons, mothers and younger siblings, older brothers and younger sisters, husbands and wives. Generally speaking, the men are widowed, the women are wifeless, the old are childless, and the young are orphaned. If one were to gather all the families in one place and ask, the old and young, men and women, would mostly be alone, orphaned, wifeless, or widowed. It is self-evident. However, the fire, which caused this unprecedented disaster, is attributed by people to an act of God. While Heaven is heartless, the blame for failing to save lives lies with humans. Furthermore, after the fire had already started, the factory gates were firmly secured by "iron generals" (that is, the back door was locked and could not be opened, as reported in various newspapers), preventing the victims from escaping. They were helpless and forced to await their deaths. If not for the firefighters' selfless courage in opening the gates, all the workers in the factory would have perished. Therefore, the factory authorities must bear the responsibility, which is beyond doubt. Moreover, the fact that the "iron generals" secured the factory gates is verifiable, and the tragic deaths of the victims have been confirmed. Although I did not kill Bo Ren, Bo Ren died because of me. How can the factory's responsibility be evaded? The deceased used to rely on hard labor and sweat to support the old and raise the young. Now, the old and young have no one to rely on. The living used to rely on their spouses and children to provide for their old age and carry on the family line. Now, all hope is lost. The dead and the living are equally unfortunate. The dead should be properly buried, and the living must be properly cared for. It is customary to bury the dead, and it is a constant principle to care for the living. If the dead died innocently and the living have no way to sustain their lives, what remains of national law and heavenly justice? The public danger is unimaginable. The dead have vanished and become nothing, beyond remedy. The living still have a breath and refuse to remain silent. While we cannot identify the principal offender, nor flay and devour them to avenge the dead, we know that the responsibility lies with the factory authorities. The factory authorities must do well by the living and comfort the dead. The dictates of justice leave no room for excuses. How can we bear to erase the truth? Therefore, in addition to reporting to the Public Security Bureau, we must submit this plea detailing the tragic deaths to your compassionate office. With your compassionate heart and in accordance with Heaven's virtue of cherishing life, we ask you to redress the great wrong done to the dead and provide for the living. If you can bring life to the living and bless the bones of the deceased, and uphold justice to promote righteousness, not only the living will sing your praises, but the dead will also repay your kindness in the afterlife. In utmost sorrow, we express our urgent need for assistance and await your command. Respectfully submitted by: Peng Daxun, et al. Legal representative: Yan Lunkui. November 8th, 1930.</p>

<h3>Zhang Henian Chinese Pharmacy Fetes the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhang Xiangjun, a leading figure in the pharmaceutical industry, recognizing the growing population in the Zhabei area and the lack of a well-equipped and meticulously planned Chinese pharmacy, established Zhang Henian Chinese Pharmacy at the intersection of Xin Zha Road and Xin Jia Garden's eastern entrance at the corner of McTyeire Road. The building is a four-bay, tall Shikumen structure built from scratch. After three years of preparation, the pharmacy is now ready and will open tomorrow (the 10th). Yesterday afternoon, the pharmacy hosted a banquet to welcome the press. Mr. Cai Diaotu was delegated to invite guests, including Yan Duhe, Zhou Shoujuan, Zhang Mengxiong, Qian Xiaohe, and over fifty others. The event was grand and lively.

After the tour, they went to Kang Sheng Photo Studio on Avenue Joffre for a commemorative photograph.</p>
<h3>Record of the Tenant Meeting at Qingyun Li</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Xing Dingcheng, the manager of Qingyun Li, a property on North Sichuan Road, Chongming Road, owned by the British firm New Sassoon, forcibly evicted tenants after his rent increases failed. On the morning of September 10th, at approximately 10:00 AM, he ordered over two hundred White Russian thugs to rush into the neighborhood, forcibly demolishing houses, injuring people, and looting property. After the incident, people from all walks of life were outraged and offered assistance. The Qingyun Li Tenant Association hired lawyers Wang Zuxun and Xue Jiaqi to file a lawsuit with the Shanghai Special District Court. Unexpectedly, during the fourth hearing on the 4th of this month, Gu Wensheng, a member of the Second District Party Branch, appeared in court to testify for Xing Dingcheng. After the hearing, the tenants, feeling that Gu, as a party member, should not have flattered foreigners and testified falsely, violating party discipline and harming the people, were indignant. They urged the Qingyun Li Tenant Association to convene a general meeting to discuss countermeasures. The association subsequently convened a general meeting yesterday at 2:00 PM, with over a thousand people in attendance. Chairman Tang Huilian followed protocol and (1) reported on the proceedings of the first, second, third, and fourth court hearings. They then passed a resolution to address the illegal actions of party member Gu Wensheng and submitted a report to the various municipal organs and district party branches, requesting the Central Party Headquarters to severely punish him. The report is as follows:</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Authorities: On September 10th, the residents of our neighborhood were cruelly ravaged by Xing Dingcheng, the manager of the British firm New Sassoon, who personally led White Russian thugs to forcibly apply illegal pressure, causing injuries and property damage. The cause of this was Xing Dingcheng's greed for increased rents, disregarding the blood invested by his predecessors. He achieved his goals for his own selfish gain. However, over four hundred households in the neighborhood, comprising over three thousand residents, will be unable to restore their homes once evicted and will inevitably become impoverished and unemployed, violating the Premier's principle of protecting people's livelihoods. Xing Dingcheng, as a Chinese, willingly accepts the patronage of imperialists and engages in harming his compatriots, which is truly heartbreaking. Now, the injured, such as Miao Shela, have filed a lawsuit with the Special District Court, requesting that Xing Dingcheng be punished according to the law. The case has been heard four times, and witnesses, including two named Du and Yan, have testified and confirmed that Xing Dingcheng was indeed present at the scene to direct the thugs. Moreover, this matter has shocked Hongkou, and the evidence is clear. Our neighborhood is located between the northern section of Sichuan Road and Chongming Road. The White Russians demolished houses and injured people at 10:00 AM. Upon reviewing the reports of the October 23rd court hearing, Xing Dingcheng stated in his testimony that he took a car to Sichuan Road at 9:45 AM on September 10th, which is a clumsy attempt to cover up the truth. Unexpectedly, during the third court hearing on October 30th, Xing Dingcheng suddenly made up a story in an attempt to evade responsibility, claiming, "I did go to Sichuan Road at 9:00 AM on September 10th to meet my friend Gu Wensheng at Zhenqinji Real Estate Company to discuss important matters. I was not at the scene where the White Russians were demolishing houses. If the court does not believe me, Gu can testify." Judge Cheng wanted to question Gu Wensheng at the time, but Gu Wensheng was not present to testify. In principle, such an important witness should have been mentioned by Xing Dingcheng during the first two court hearings. Why did he not mention him? Now that he has been mentioned, why is Gu Wensheng not present to testify? This is logically inconsistent, indicating that Xing Dingcheng's temporary fabrication to evade blame has been exposed. Moreover, Gu Wensheng, as a party member, has violated the Premier's legacy of promoting the principle of people's livelihoods and shamelessly stepped forward on the 4th of this month to testify falsely for Xing Dingcheng, the lackey of imperialists. The details can be found in the Republic Daily of the 6th of this month. You must know that the lives and property of thousands of residents in our neighborhood are now in extreme danger, all caused by Xing Dingcheng's vicious heart. New Sassoon is a large company with a complex organization, with various departments responsible for different tasks. Xing Dingcheng is the manager responsible for the rental and management of properties. The agreement with the Da Zhonghua Company to increase rents was also managed by Xing Dingcheng. Moreover, he personally led the White Russian thugs in their violent acts. If the residents of our neighborhood did not value peace and had not endured humiliation, there would certainly have been casualties, and the May Thirtieth Tragedy would have been reenacted today. Thinking about this afterwards is chilling and terrifying. From this, we can see that Xing Dingcheng is a willing instigator, and his crimes are too numerous to count. Now that the residents of our neighborhood have suffered this injustice, we can only appeal to the law in the hope of redress. If Gu Wensheng could use his position as a party member to mediate and alleviate the suffering of the people, over three thousand residents of our neighborhood would certainly welcome and thank him profusely. How could Gu choose not to do this, but instead willingly betray his conscience, disregard party discipline, and aid Xing Dingcheng in his oppression, attempting to bury our grievances forever? We ask, what have over three thousand residents of our neighborhood done to Gu Wensheng that he must put us to death? Today, all the residents of our neighborhood are filled with inexplicable indignation because Gu Wensheng is colluding with Xing to do evil and increase the arrogance of imperialists. Therefore, we entrust our association to write to your department, requesting that you investigate and verify Gu Wensheng's false testimony and harm to the people. We implore your department to uphold justice and propose appropriate reprimands to uphold party discipline and quell public anger. We would be deeply grateful for your assistance.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Responds to Request to Rectify Tea Tax</h3>
<p>The China National Products Maintenance Association previously received a proposal from member Sun Fuxian regarding the heavy taxation of Anhui tea transported to Beijing and sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting its abolition. Yesterday, the association received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance stating: "Your telegram regarding member Sun Fuxian's letter stating that tea merchants transporting Anhui tea are encountering difficulties and delays due to various checkpoints along the way, and attaching a list of various checkpoint taxes, requesting that the office rectify the situation, impose a one-time tax, issue a receipt, and allow passage to alleviate the suffering of merchants, will be forwarded to the Anhui Finance Commissioner for investigation and response."

Recently, the faculty and students of the school have been planning to organize a consumer cooperative, with the aim of promoting convenience for all and promoting the cooperative movement. The cooperative's building has been completed, and they are actively recruiting members to join and invest. After the cooperative is established, in addition to providing students with necessities, they also plan to establish an agricultural and industrial products exhibition hall and to connect with domestic goods industries in Shanghai to promote the Buy Chinese Movement on campus.</p>

<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor: Regarding the news in your esteemed newspaper today concerning Mr. Yang Hucheng purchasing and transporting military vehicles into Shaanxi, specifically mentioning the dispatch of our army brigade commander Zhong Chuheng from Shaanxi to Shanghai to oversee the transportation, there is a slight discrepancy with the facts. Our brigade commander entrusted Li Ziguang, director of our office in Hankou, to purchase a car. The car has already been bought, and Li indeed asked Mr. Zhong to find a way to transport it to Hankou. Furthermore, Mr. Zhong is not our army brigade commander. Fearing the spread of misinformation, we are sending this letter to your esteemed newspaper for clarification and request immediate correction. Respectfully, Representative Hu Yimin of the Seventh Army, November 8th.</p>
<p>To the esteemed Editor: In the local news section of your newspaper on the 7th of this month, regarding the banking sector's regulations for the New Year holiday, it was mentioned that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Association had already resolved to abolish the lunar calendar in accordance with the National Government's order, and designated February 17th and 18th as the Spring Festival holiday, with two days of closure. Upon investigation, our Chamber has not discussed the so-called Spring Festival holiday matter, nor has it received any letter from the Banking Association to consult on the New Year holiday. The National Government has already made regulations, so there is no need for our Chamber to discuss it separately. Please publish this letter in the "Correspondence" section of your esteemed newspaper to reflect the truth, for which we would be most grateful. To the Shenbao Newspaper Office, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, November 8th.</p>

<p>Groom: Ah, that's because when his wife passed away last time, I sent him a very large wreath and went to offer my condolences. This time I'm getting married, so he sent me a very large flower basket. He even came to offer his condolences the night before the wedding. We are old friends who have been through thick and thin!</p>

<h3>A Tale of Reunion</h3>
<p>— Qizhen</p>
<p>Yesterday, I attended the wedding banquet of my clan member Zuo Sheng. Someone who knew the love story of the newlyweds told it vividly. It was so tragic and extraordinary that all the guests were moved. I am recording it to tell the readers.</p>
<p>Fate Brings Them Together: Sheng has been working in a certain institution in Xindu for several years. He traveled to Jinshan and Jiaoshan some years ago and stayed at a friend's house. The friend was originally from Dantu, and his wife taught at a certain girls' school in that town. Therefore, there was no shortage of beautiful students among the pupils. Through the introduction of his friend's wife, Sheng met a Miss Xu. The girl was gentle and intelligent, and Sheng was attracted to her. He often invited her to go out together, and the girl did not refuse. After a long time, they became close. After a ten-day trip to Pingyuan, when they returned, the girl saw him off at the station, and they parted reluctantly. Zhenjiang and Ningzhen were not far apart, and the transportation was convenient. It only took half a day to go back and forth. Since Sheng knew the girl, he took a train to Zhenjiang every holiday to see her. Sometimes they questioned each other, analyzed difficulties, and discussed their studies, or they climbed mountains and rivers together, like lovebirds, their happiness was harmonious. After several months, their hearts were in harmony, so they swore an oath to the mountains and seas and vowed to be together forever.</p>
<p>Turbulence in the Sea of Love: That summer, the girl graduated and lived in Shanghai. Their communication gradually decreased. Sheng was about to ask a matchmaker to propose to the girl's family when he suddenly received a letter from the girl, saying that she had recently been informed by her family that she had been promised to a Mr. Liu from Hanjiang. It was difficult to disobey her parents' orders, so she asked him to look for another good match as soon as possible. If fate was not exhausted, they would meet in Yan Jin again. Sheng was shocked as if he had heard a thunderbolt in the clear sky. He was so surprised that he almost fainted several times. The next day, he went to Shanghai to visit the girl. However, the girl had gone to Wumen with her mother to visit relatives a few days ago. Sheng waited for a long time but she did not return, so he went back disappointed. After that, although Sheng repeatedly sent letters, he received no reply. When he went to Shanghai again, the phoenix had left the building and the girl's family had moved. At this point, Sheng was depressed and unhappy, and all his thoughts were extinguished. After two years, he still did not get married, because he could not forget the girl.</p>
<p>Illness Plays Cupid: Worry can hurt the body. Sheng was so obsessed with thinking about the girl day and night that he fell ill. He was confined to his bed, but his illness was in his heart, and medicine was of little help. So he asked for leave and returned to Shanghai to stay. At that time, his residence had just been moved. Sheng lived in the pavilion, and after lingering for more than a month, he showed no signs of recovery. One night, when the night was deep and quiet, and it was close to midnight, Sheng woke up from a dream of missing her, and his tears wet his pillow. Suddenly, he heard the sound of reading aloud, clear and melodious. Listening carefully, it seemed familiar. He couldn't help but feel curious and struggled to get up. He pushed open the window and looked out. He saw that the stars were sparse and the moon was bright, shining like a painting. A young woman on the opposite building was leaning against the window, reading a book under the moon. Her appearance and hair looked like Miss Xu. He looked at her for a long time and wanted to call out, but he was afraid of being presumptuous, so he did not dare to act rashly. The next morning, he asked his family to inquire, saying that this was a Mr. Liu from Hanjiang, the owner of the house had passed away, and all that was left was an aunt and a daughter-in-law. The daughter-in-law, Miss Xu, was still young and a recent widow, not yet a year since her husband's death. Sheng was overjoyed to hear that the person he saw last night was indeed Miss Xu, and his illness gradually improved.</p>
<p>Heaven Grants Their Wish: In a few days, Sheng's illness suddenly disappeared. He eagerly wanted to meet the girl, so he closed the window and waited for her. He finally met her. At that time, they were both overjoyed and sad. For a long time, they could not say a word. The girl thought that Sheng was dead and had been living as a widow out of guilt. Sheng returned to Dadu to work and went back to see the girl every month. They often talked about marriage, but the girl always felt that she was not perfect enough and was ashamed to be Sheng's wife, and that the family was old-fashioned and things were not easy. Therefore, she strongly advised Sheng to marry someone else first, and wait for an opportunity to be a concubine to serve him. However, Sheng was deeply in love and did not want to do so. He vowed to remain single and wait for her for the rest of his life. Years passed, and five years had passed. Sheng and the girl had been guarding each other for several years. Recently, the girl obtained the permission of her parents, and the couple was finally able to become husband and wife.</p>
<h3>A Farewell Banquet for Mr. Doya Jukou [土屋計左右]</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>Mr. Doya Jukou, the general manager of the Shanghai Mitsui Bank for many years, has been dedicated to Chinese and Japanese art. He has now been promoted to the Tokyo head office and will soon return home with honor. Chinese and Japanese people have been hosting farewell banquets for him for days. On the evening of the 5th, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Shigemitsu Aoi, hosted a banquet at his private residence at 15 Seymour Road. On the Japanese side, there were Deputy Consul Tanaka, the Oriental Culture Committee member Sakai Yosamichi, Hayashi Izukenjiro, Funatsu Tatsuiro, and Sato Yasunosuke. On the Chinese side, there were mostly famous figures in the art world, including Wang Yiting, Di Chuqing, Huang Binhong, Zhang Shanzi, Qian Shoutie, Yu Jifan, Wang Yingbin, Li Yunshu, Li Zuhan, and Wang Caizun, totaling two tables. The dishes were vegetarian dishes from Jue Lin, with a total of 30 flavors, which were very exquisite. Because Mr. Li is the owner of Jue Lin and has many vegetarian dishes, Mr. Yunshu invented a variety of dishes, so we were able to enjoy the delicious food. During the dinner, we talked about the age of the people present. Mr. Binhong was the oldest at our table, followed by Yunshu, then Sakai Yosamichi, and Shoutie was the youngest. Tanaka happened to be forty years old, and people encouraged him to celebrate his birthday. He mentioned that Japanese birthday celebrations are different from Chinese ones. Chinese people celebrate big birthdays every ten years, while Japanese people only celebrate forty-one and sixty-one. It is said that forty-one is an unlucky year, and sixty-one is a full cycle of the zodiac. Japanese men especially dislike nineteen years old, and women dislike twenty-five years old. Every time they reach that year, they avoid talking about it. Northern China also avoids forty-one, and even uses it as a curse. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang, women marrying at eighteen are considered unlucky. This is similar to Westerners' dislike of thirteen, and is equally incomprehensible. Caizun's appearance, figure, speech, and behavior are very similar to Japanese people. Those who meet him for the first time often misunderstand him. On the other hand, Tanaka and Sakai Yosamichi are very similar to Chinese people. Sakai Yosamichi has been in China for 40 years and has traveled all over the country. The qualifications of Zuhan, Shoutie, and I, who are all under forty, are actually inferior to him. After the banquet, we followed the usual practice of painting for the host. Mr. Yiting wrote "Pine and Crane Longevity", the pine needles were written with continuous strokes, which looked like the letters M W V N in English. Then Mr. Binhong wrote a landscape painting, Mr. Chuqing wrote bamboo. I was in Jiangwan and eager to go home first, so I wrote a narcissus and left.</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemum Anecdotes at the Three Friends</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>The autumn wind is howling, and the chrysanthemums are in full bloom. The Three Friends Industrial Company's factory has built a chrysanthemum garden next to Mayushan Road in Pudong, covering tens of acres and cultivating tens of thousands of chrysanthemums. All kinds of famous chrysanthemums are gathered here, making a spectacular sight. Now that the chrysanthemum garden is open to the public, ladies and gentlemen flock to visit. The main entrance of the chrysanthemum garden is made of red chrysanthemums in the shape of a triangle, with white chrysanthemums at the bottom. The outer circle has a diameter of ten zhang [~33 meters], and the characters "Three Friends" are formed with yellow chrysanthemums, each character about five zhang [~16.5 meters] square, which is truly a spectacle. Here are some anecdotes from the garden to amuse you.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Youren Strokes His Beard and Smiles: Yesterday afternoon, Central Committee member Yu Youren arrived gracefully in a car with a total of four people. In addition to Yu, there were also Mr. Yuan Chunyu, Mr. Zeng Tongyi, and Ms. Qi Xiaofeng. Everyone personally signed the visitor's registration book. After Yu entered the garden, he took a look and saw that the famous flowers were competing to please the eye. He couldn't help but sigh, "What a magnificent sight!" When he went to the inner garden and saw the black chrysanthemums and green chrysanthemums blooming together, he praised again, "What a flowery world!" Ms. Xiaofeng said to Yu, "Can I ask for a pot or two of these chrysanthemums?" Yu quickly stopped her and said, "If everyone wants them, there will be nothing left to display." The words were heard by the garden's receptionist, who stepped forward and declared that he was willing to give a few pots for them to enjoy. Yu stroked his beard and smiled in return.</p>
<p>Yue Zhenbao Wields His Brush for the Guests: Mr. Yue Zhenbao, a well-known figure in the business world, went to the chrysanthemum garden yesterday and happened to meet Mr. Zhao Heqing, a famous scholar from Hunan. They entered the rest room together. Zhao wrote a poem to commemorate the occasion: "With their dazzling colors and graceful shapes, they overcome the west wind with their proud bones. Except for Tao Yuanming, few people understand them. The Three Friends endure the cold season together." Mr. Yue immediately wrote a poem in response and wielded his brush for the guests. His calligraphy was quite exquisite and superior to many other wealthy merchants.</p>
<p>Purchasing Gift Certificates With Extravagance: A certain wealthy man visited the garden and happened to be received by Mr. Xu Qixiang, who was in charge of the garden. Mr. Xu was graceful and eloquent, and was known as a social butterfly. He explained the various famous flowers to the wealthy man in detail. When he saw a potted stand of chrysanthemums, the wealthy man liked it very much. However, the chrysanthemum required the purchase of one hundred yuan worth of Three Friends gift certificates to be given away. Although the wealthy man was rich, he was stingy with his money. Now, he actually bought one hundred yuan worth of gift certificates under the lotus tongue of the social butterfly and carried the chrysanthemum away, which can be considered extravagant.</p>
<h3>Postscript on the Yishe Rehearsal</h3>
<p>— Juyin</p>
<p>Friends in the ticket circle say that the Yishe troupe has a long history in the Shanghai ticket world and that each rehearsal has garnered praise. This is because the person in charge handles things perfectly, there are many talented people, and the results are naturally not weak. This seventh rehearsal was extraordinarily lively, and there are many noteworthy details about the situation at the time. I will pick up a few to leave a mark.</p>
<p>Qiao Mengmei, Skilled in Civil and Military Roles: Mr. Qiao plays Empress He scolding the court. His voice is broad and his breath is full, so he sings the slow tempo and the quick tempo with ease from beginning to end. In the evening, he plays the City of Sizhou and fights with Sun Wukong. His skills are skilled, unhurried, and very interesting to watch. The two plays are civil and military, each excelling in its own way.</p>
<p>Two Great Ticket Holders Showcase Their Skills: One of the two ticket holders is Ni Qiuping, a well-known name in Shanghai, and the other is Wang Ruoqi. On this day, in deference to Mr. Wang Zhexiang's request, he performed Chang'e Flies to the Moon. The first scene began with a slow tempo and the first phrase, which won a lot of applause. Mr. Wang's singing was also full of charm. The Southern Bangzi excerpt was especially worth savoring. The rest, such as the posture, costume, and waist work, were all excellent. This play was created by Mei Lanfang and is one of the ancient costume plays. It was unexpected to see it performed by amateur actors, and I was fortunate to witness it.</p>
<p>Shi Zhendong, Excellent in Both Male and Female Roles: Shi Zhendong is a pillar of the Yishe troupe. The play he performed on that day was Saying Goodbye to Xue Pinggui. His posture was very characteristic. His posture during the farewell was composed and calm, which can be described as steady and experienced. In the evening, he transformed into a princess in the play Visiting Mother and Inquiring Minds. His slow tempo and the flowing water of the oath were sweet and round, closely resembling Hui Sheng. Mr. Shi Zhendong excels in both male and female roles.</p>
<p>The Entire Cast Performs the Imperial Stele Pavilion: Finally, Mr. Zeng Manjun and Mr. Zhai Zhifu performed the full version of the Imperial Stele Pavilion. Mr. Zeng's Wang Youdao's voice was high and bright, his words were accurate, and his melody was rounded. His costume and stage steps were also natural and unrestrained. The excerpt from the Western Leather Original Board at the time of writing the divorce letter was especially wonderful. Unfortunately, the rest of the excerpts were covered by strange noises, so I couldn't hear them, which was very annoying. Although Mr. Zhai's Meng Yuehua's costume was mediocre, his performance was very skilled. The two sliding steps when avoiding the rain and the frightened look when Wang Youdao rebuked her were vividly portrayed, as if she was in the scene. Moreover, the entire play did not use a professional troupe, and all the supporting roles were performed by troupe members, each contributing their own strengths, which was especially commendable.</p>
<h3>New World's Literary Riddles Flourish</h3>

<p>The New World Amusement Park is the ultimate place for recreation and sorrow relief in Shanghai. Since its internal renovation, it has attracted various high-end entertainment and is welcomed by the upper class.

<h3>West Lake Impressions (III)</h3>
<p>— Huijian</p>
<p>On the 7th, I got up at 7 a.m. and went to the Lakeside Park to find the boatman from yesterday. He took us by boat to the south, first to the Orioles Singing in the Willows. The place is very close to Yongjin Gate, and the thousand willows on the water present a different scenery. In the pavilion in the east, there is a huge stone tablet with the inscription "Orioles Singing in the Willows" in red letters, which was written by Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty. The Zou Youqian Wang Temple was built by the people of Zhejiang to worship Qian Miao. The temple is magnificent, and looking north from the temple embankment, the scenery of the lake seems to have a wonderful structure. Banxia said that the willows drooping in the clear autumn water deserve to be one of the ten scenic spots. The imperial boat went further west to the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon. A boy was on the boat to collect water chestnuts, so we went there first. There are four islands in West Lake: Gushan, which is now connected to the mainland by Bai Causeway, Ruan Dun, Huxin Pavilion, and Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, all of which are isolated in the water and cannot be reached without a boat. Among the three islands, the scenery of the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon is the best. The winding Su Causeway to the west sets it off beautifully. The area is also the widest. The front is the Imperial Stele Pavilion, the back is Xiaoyingzhou, and the middle is a deep pool with a curved bridge built on it, which is very artistic. It turns out that this place was not originally an island, but later a dike was built around the pool. Its completion was man-made rather than natural, which was not easy. Last night, we visited here when it was dark and we could not see everything. Lao Lan insisted on revisiting, so we sat in the Yingxuan Pavilion on the front shore. At noon, we took a boat to Wang Zhuang in Changqiao. The Zhuang was newly built in Western style and belonged to a tea merchant named Wang from Shanghai. The content was not worth seeing. After leaving Wang Zhuang, we went to Chishanbu to disembark. This place is close to Su Causeway and backs against Dingling Mountain. The scenery is very similar to Jiangcun, Gao Zhuang, Jiang Zhuang, and Huagang Guanyu. When we passed Huagang, a young woman and a man were sitting and drinking tea. Gao Zhuang is purely a Chinese old-style building and is adjacent to Huagang. It is the old house of Mr. Gao from Hangzhou, the so-called Hongli Mountain Villa. We entered and saw that the window and pavilion structure were elegant and simple, but it seemed to have been abandoned for a long time. People today feel like they are passing through ruins. About one or two hundred steps from Gao Zhuang is Jiang Zhuang. The boatman said that it was Commander-in-Chief Jiang's villa, but it was actually the villa of Jiang Su'an from Jinling. Su'an was a descendant of Jiang Zi and liked literature very much. This house originally belonged to Lian Nanhu from Wuxi. Lian was troubled by debts, so Jiang bought it for 30,000 gold and slightly renovated it to make it look new. Jiang Jieshi once stayed here when he visited West Lake, so people mistakenly thought it was Jiang's house. There are several famous couplets in the house. Kang Youwei's couplet called Su'an "little friend" and was very interesting. After leaving Jiang Zhuang, the boatman asked if we needed lunch. We agreed, and he recommended the restaurant in front of Liu Zhuang. When we arrived, there were only a few thatched huts and the food was very bad. Entering Liu Zhuang, we found that it was the crown of all the gardens in the lake. There were many kinds of antiques and treasures in the hall. A ink duck marble screen was very eye-catching. On the windows of the back hall, ink vines were used to entangle flowers and landscapes. All the sketches were extremely lifelike. The owner of the Zhuang was a Cantonese man named Liu, who was rich in resources. Behind the Zhuang, he built his own tomb and the tombs of eight concubines were arranged on both sides in the shape of a swallowtail. Banxia said that this gentleman's outlook on life was worth studying.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Shows Slight Weakness</h3>
<p>Fluctuations Within Two Taels, No Major Gains or Losses: Yesterday, the 8th, the gold market showed a reverse trend after successive gains. The market remained flat in the morning, but weakened around noon. There were no significant gains or losses, with only about two taels of fluctuation. Foreign exchange remained scarce, and banks had slight difficulties in accepting East Asian currencies. Demand and supply varied among dealers. Yuansheng, Yu Da, goods companies, and the Dalian trading group all had both buying and selling activity, as did Yifeng, Yongfu, Changyuan, and Lichang. Prices seemed low in the early morning, but the overseas silver market remained stable and sellers were active. Subsequently, Yuansheng and arbitrageurs made purchases, causing prices to rebound strongly. The market then leveled off. Around noon, sellers increased, and market sentiment became weak, leading to a decline of two taels. The price then reached eighty-two taels. Later, due to the usual weekend market closure, the market was indecisive.</p>
<p>The market fell slightly in the morning by two taels. For delivery in December, the opening price in the morning was 583.5 taels, down 0.5 tael. (The gross price was around 4 taels). Large silver bars and exchange rates remained unchanged. Subsequently, Yifeng and Yongfu sold off, pushing prices down by another 0.5 tael to 83 taels. Soon, Yuancheng and arbitrageurs bought, pushing the price up by 1.0 tael to 84.2 taels. Exchange rates remained stable. Sumitomo bought spot gold, and the Dalian group bought at 1.262 taels. The official rate for January remained unchanged, but the January English gold rate could be settled at 174.375, so the price was 83.9 taels. In a short time, Wanxing, Shunli, Yu Da, and others entered the market to buy, and Zhengjin bought February English gold at 174.375, raising the price by 1.0 tael to 85.1 taels. At this time, Fuchang and individual investors sold off, immediately dropping the price by 7-8 qian. At around 10 o'clock, the price was 4.3-4.4 taels. Soon after, arbitrageurs bought in, adding 0.5-0.6 qian, making the price 4.8-4.9 taels. However, Dongya sold January English gold at 174.375, and the Dalian group sold, dropping the price by 1.0 tael to 3.8 taels in just ten minutes. Then, because the Bank of China and Hua Bi did a deal on the current month's Citibank at 39.25 yuan, the price rebounded by 0.7-0.8 qian to 4.6 taels. At 10:30, the price was 4.6 taels. Hua Bi and Mitsui bought spot gold from the Dalian group at 1.26375 taels. Afterwards, the trend was flat, fluctuating by only a few qian. Around 11 o'clock, the price fell slightly by 0.4-0.5 qian. Then, at 84 taels, the price remained stable for a long time. Suddenly, at 11:45, a storm arose. Daheng Yuan sold off, and other firms followed suit. In just over ten minutes, the price dropped by 1.4-1.5 taels. Market sentiment panicked, and the market fluctuated. At noon, the closing price was 82.8 taels, down 1.2 taels from the previous day. Continued trading for over ten minutes caused the price to drop by less than two taels. The exchange was not responsible for this, and the dealers settled it themselves. The maximum price for the morning session was 5.1 taels, and the minimum price was 2.8 taels, a difference of 2.3 taels. The announced price was still 619.8 taels, with 36-37 taels deducted. The registered amount was 92 taels to 83 taels, with 92 taels used for compensation. The price for commodities in the early market was 3.6 taels, and the closing price was 2 taels.</p>
<p>Different trading behaviors within the market: Among the various firms, Yifeng, Yongfu, Fuchang, Yiheng, Lichang, Hengxing, Taiheng Yuan sold off. Shunli, Wanxing, Yuancheng, Yu Da, and Tongtaichang all bought in. Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyong, Senchangyong, Yuanxingyong, and Chunyongyong engaged in both buying and selling, sometimes buying and selling on behalf of customers, so the volume was not small. Arbitrageurs bought up goods. Other firms did not have large orders. The Dalian group was eager to buy, taking in 800 bars and releasing 200 bars. The Guangdong group sold off a small amount.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market was dull with no fresh developments. The Yokohama and Kobe exchange rates also saw no gains or losses.

<h3>Securities 96 Bonds Plunge Back Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond futures market was strong and trading was active as before, but spot transactions remained scarce. Only the "19" tax bond and demobilization bonds saw some trading in the morning, while other bonds had no market presence. Regarding price fluctuations, the "96" bond, due to excessive gains in recent days, experienced a correction, with holders taking the opportunity to sell continuously. However, as there was no news of any reorganization measures, buyers were temporarily in a wait-and-see mode, leading to an oversupply in the market and a weakening trend, with the lowest price in the morning session falling by 2.45 yuan compared to the previous day. The afternoon session rebounded slightly but still fell by 1.67 yuan compared to the previous day. Other bonds saw more moderate fluctuations, with price changes of only 2-3 cents compared to the previous day.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market: Quiet and Dispersed</h3>
<p>The yarn market is flat and weak, but the overseas cotton yarn market is showing signs of firmness. The local market is extremely quiet and dispersed, so the overall situation remains sluggish. The supply of yarn is increasingly tight, and all sectors lack vitality, leading to widespread selling and shorting. However, some manufacturers are still buying, remaining steadfast. In summary, the lack of real demand makes it difficult for the market to rebound, with only some Chaozhou traders engaging in short selling.</p>
<p>Human Index: Flat and weak. Although US cotton rose before the opening, market sentiment remained scattered, with all months falling by 2-3 cents. Trading in the market was particularly light. The afternoon market situation remained soft, with all months falling again by 1-2 cents. Total transactions for the day were 9,350 bales. Sales included: Gongtai 800 bales, Yuantai 400 bales, Lichang 600 bales, Senkang 450 bales, and others 200-300 bales. Purchases included: Dafeng 750 bales, Daji 1,000 bales, Gengfeng 400 bales, and others 200-300 bales. Closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Human Index Closing Prices, Changes, and Inventory:</p>
<p>Month　Closing Price　Change　Inventory</p>
<p>November　14.57　Down 3　314,000</p>

<p>February　14.86　Down 3　214,000</p>
<p>March　14.88　Down 7　810,000</p>
<p>Yarn Sales: Quiet. Current yarn sales are relatively clear. Statistics for the day show that all sectors purchased a total of over 600 bales, with 10 bales purchased by fellow traders. Market conditions are flat and weak. Purchases by out-of-town sectors included: 100 bales to inland areas, 30 bales to Wuhu, 50 bales to Shantou, 155 bales to Sichuan, 30 bales to Anqing, 85 bales to Guangdong, and 40 bales to miscellaneous sectors, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market: Stable</h3>
<p>The cotton market is firm, with US cotton showing a stable trend. In addition, supplies from all routes are dwindling. Due to high local prices, Han traders are unwilling to sell short. Some bulls are engaging in short squeezes in the November contracts, so the situation is particularly strong. However, the overall direction depends on the US cotton estimate release before determining strategy, so the market remains stable. However, spot cotton trading is quiet, and Indian cotton mills have made large purchases. Currently, it is firm due to timing issues, but a surge in arrivals later may lead to drastic changes.</p>
<p>Han Index: Good Sentiment. The Han Index opened with better sentiment due to the rebound in US cotton, and the current month is particularly firm due to poor supply, rising by 1 cent and 5 fen in the near term and 5 fen in the long term. The afternoon market situation remained strong, with all rising by 5 fen. Total transactions for the day were 33,600 "dan." Sales included: Tianchang 5,100 "dan," Yuanda 1,700 "dan," Zhenda 1,500 "dan," Minghua 1,600 "dan." Purchases included: Yuchang 1,700 "dan," Jinfeng 1,800 "dan," Rongxing 1,400 "dan," Tongxing 1,400 "dan," and others 1,100 "dan." Closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>April　52.05　Up 5　523,600</p>
<p>Spot Cotton: No Sales. Spot cotton business is stagnant, and all factories have no plans to purchase. Current stock is estimated at 420 bales of Taohua cotton, it is said.</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton Yarn: Mostly Up, Few Down</h3>
<p>US Cotton: Short Covering Rebound. Yesterday, US cotton rebounded due to good news from Liverpool and a lack of short sellers. Futures rose by 11-15 points, spot rose by 10 points. UK cotton futures rose by 3 points, spot unchanged, and spot cotton rose by 5 points. Indian cotton was weak due to the small decline in US cotton and local short selling. Pingguo fell by 3 rupees, and Aomu, Labaipan, and Creek all fell by 6 rupees. Original telegraph records are left (7th telegram):</p>

<h3>Prediction of US Cotton Government Report</h3>
<p>New York, 7th: The fourth US cotton government estimate will be released on the 8th. Based on various private estimates, the production amount is predicted to be 14,398,000 bales, and the quantity already ginned is 11,000,000 bales.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Market Still Not Optimistic</h3>
<p>Grain Market Weak, Securities Also Weary</p>
<p>New York, 7th: Reporting on the cotton market situation for the week, the cotton price reaction in the spot market that occurred after the price increases in the second half of October continued this week. After the May futures price reached 12 cents, buying by the industry gradually decreased, with purchases resuming only when prices fell back. In reality, the cotton price increase from the low point in early October has loosened the cotton market's position. When purchases by the industry and short covering gradually subsided, the market price became weak due to selling from the South and profit-taking by bulls. The grain market is weak, securities have also not become firm, and the content of the government cotton production report on November 8 is still uncertain. Therefore, the trend of squaring positions has become more pronounced, intending to wait for future developments. It is doubtful whether the price increases can be sustained before there is a real improvement in trade and a real reduction in cotton fields. Therefore, bullish sentiment is still limited by this kind of doubt.</p>
<p>The domestic inquiry for recent shipments is progressing compared to before, but futures are receiving less attention, especially the 1932 futures, which lack attention. Domestic locking fees remain low. Domestic cloth trading is firmer, but transaction volume is less. The average opinion is that the agricultural ministry's cotton production report will be approximately 14.5 million bales. The weekend statistics are attached below (unit: thousand bales):</p>

<h3>Japonica Rice Market: Southern Prices Rise, Northern Prices Stabilize</h3>
<p>In Zhabei, the supply from various sectors was slightly better yesterday, with about twenty firms. Sales were slightly dull. After the sharp rise in new japonica rice prices, buying interest waned. High prices remained at 16.2 yuan, and the situation showed a stabilizing trend. The supply of "thin" rice remained weak, and the market remained firm. Top quality opened at 15.7 yuan. The shape of the "yangxian" rice market showed signs of fatigue, with sluggish sales, so it fell by 2 cents, with the top quality opening at 13.5 yuan. "Shejian" rice remained stable and especially high at the 14-yuan mark. Buying interest in port tip rice weakened, and prices decreased slightly, with the highest price at 13.5 yuan. The high price of guest tip rice was barely maintained, while mid-tier rice was reduced by 2-3 cents. Due to rain, transactions were extremely rare throughout the day, and the market felt sluggish.</p>
<p>In South Shanghai yesterday, very little rice arrived by river, and sales in the main streets were sluggish, but market sentiment was very good due to the previous day's price increases. New japonica rice from Changbang rose by 3 cents, with the highest quality requiring the 16-yuan mark. Su-Tong white japonica rice also prospered, rising to 14.8 yuan. Very little "thin" rice arrived from Nanlu, and the market situation was very tight, with the top quality opening at 15.6 yuan, both of which increased by 2-3 cents. "Yangxian" rice opened at around 13 yuan, and "Dujian" rice at 13.3 yuan, both also increasing by 2 cents. Because the source of "xian" rice is very scarce, price increases are inevitable. "Yinyuan" was slightly firm, reaching as high as 11.4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Different Views on the Flour Market</h3>
<p>Initially Firm, Then Flat, Recent Highs Diverge from Lows</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed an initial firm and then flat pattern after the opening in the morning and afternoon sessions. The prices of foreign wheat were also good at the opening of each morning, and floating shorts generally scrambled to cover. The factories were all on the sidelines, not making an offer so prices were firmer than the morning. However, the domestic market was still steady, and outside shorts had to start covering. Because wheat imports were not flowing smoothly, insiders and outsiders again found themselves in an impasse, and therefore prices went down again. As a result, this month was up 2.5 mills from the previous day, December up 2.5 mills, January/February down 7.5 mills, March down 2.5 mills, and April down 7.5 mills.</p>
<h3>Standard Market Amidst the Arrival of Foreign Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of wheat futures in the morning and afternoon, all months turned to a firm and stable trend. Foreign wheat prices also increased by 2-3 cents, and the sentiment of insiders and outsiders naturally turned stable. However, because very little local wheat was available this month, although there was a large stockpile of high-quality wheat inland, the combined price did not justify shipping to Shanghai. The chips of the shorts were all supported by foreign wheat. However, it turned out to be difficult in reality, and there was a reason why the sentiment was bullish. However, because Fufeng had another ship of Australian white wheat arriving at around 7,000 tons, and 1,000 tons of it had been purchased by traders and was urgently being sold off, the asking price was 4.9 taels. A certain factory only offered 4.8 taels, and they were still in negotiations. Due to this reason, market sentiment softened slightly again. As a result, November, December, and January were up 2 cents from the previous day, February and March were up 1 cent, and April was up 3 cents.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Red Dates, Lower-Grade Goods Scarce</h3>
<p>The price of Tianjin goods has eased.</p>
<p>Tianjin red dates have continued to arrive recently, and some guest goods have also been released, and prices have gradually become cheaper, and land prices have eased accordingly. The inventory is thicker than before. The market situation for high-grade goods is sluggish, so the market trend for Tianjin head households is weaker. The rest of the second and third households are selling more actively at lower prices. The head household red dates sold in the market yesterday for 10 to 9.5 taels; the second household for 7 to 6.8 taels; the third household for 5 to 4.8 taels. Miscellaneous goods such as Haojiang, Jixin Hong, and Si Hong are scarce. However, Fu Hong was active yesterday, with 260+ packages released at 5.6 taels. Lower-grade goods are scarce, and the market is relatively bullish.</p>
<h3>Hardware Market Affected by Autumn Rain</h3>
<p>Yesterday's heavy autumn rain greatly affected hardware transactions, as guest businesses mostly stopped buying because they were afraid that shipping and other items would be damaged by water stains. Therefore, transactions were sparse, but fortunately, there were no price fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Black Iron Sheets: 3,000 Bundles of New Items Arrived</h3>
<p>The shortage of 18-sheet black iron sheets in the market has long been reported in this newspaper, so general buyers are eagerly awaiting them. Yesterday, New Taikoo Wharf had 30 bundles of new goods arriving, so the market situation is expected to be free of shortages in the future. The standard price is currently selling at 11.75 taels.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Zhenmei and Pearl Tea Sales Turn Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign firm tea market, firms such as British firms Jinlong and Tianxiang started to purchase Zhenmei and Pearl tea, and transactions were quite brisk. However, the silk and tea market has been sluggish for a long time, and tea prices have fallen to the extreme, and market sentiment is weak, making it difficult to reverse the downward trend. There were no major transactions of Gongxi green tea and Qimen black tea by Russian firms yesterday, but the firm has a large sales volume and will continue to search for goods, but it is difficult to expect prices to relax.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms' Silk Sales Increasingly Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last day of the autumn races, and the foreign firms' silk market became increasingly sluggish. Yokohama Japanese silk remained sluggish, and overseas silk telegrams to Shanghai were depressed, and the market was depressed. Yesterday, Dachang sold five packages of "Double Child" brand top-grade 13-18 filament silk for 800 taels. Kechang sold twelve packages of Heji first and second grade washed yellow silk for 340 taels.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Rumors of a Final Decision on the Ningpo Cuttlefish Market</h3>
<p>Although the new production of Ningpo cuttlefish is abundant, the fishermen have united to hoard stocks in order to rectify the market because the selling price is too low. Therefore, the number of goods coming from the mountains has decreased sharply in recent days, and although the purchasing party is preparing to convene the industry to discuss a public distribution to gain profits, a public distribution was decided. Yesterday the internal determination for high grade North Beach cuttlefish price thirty eight taels, commodity goods thirty six taels, large special Ning cuttlefish thirty five taels, average twenty seven and one half taels, secondary goods after rain twenty six taels, the board will convene very soon.</p>

<h3>Northern Journey Impressions</h3>
<p>— Su Ling</p>
<p>(Twenty-Two) Returning South</p>
<p>Gang helped me get a free ticket for the Chinese Eastern Railway. Holding this piece of paper that would send me back south, as I walked down the high steps of the council hall, I felt my body was as aimless as a fallen leaf.</p>
<p>Indeed, although I had a free ticket for the Chinese Eastern Railway, my travel expenses were still insufficient. Fortunately, if Qing hadn't found me another five yuan in Japanese currency, my return south would have been further delayed. Thinking about it, how embarrassing.</p>
<p>It suddenly started raining. After saying goodbye to my friends in the clubhouse, Qing accompanied another friend to Beijing at the same time, so he saw me off at the train station.</p>
<p>I put my two worn-out bags from the north onto the train car. Alas, now I have to bring them back to Jiangnan.</p>
<p>After waving goodbye to Qing, the train body lurched forward. Now I have to say to Harbin, "(Farewell, farewell)." I remember saying this when leaving Shanghai. I didn't expect that in just half a year, Shanghai would be seeing me again. This was not what I had originally expected. But this time, it's truly hard to say when I will see Harbin again. However, for someone as rootless as me, it is certainly impossible to say that there is no possibility of returning to the Northeast in the short term. I remember three years ago, in the autumn, I swore never to go to Wuxi again because of a school trip. However, afterwards, I went to Wuxi twice in one month.</p>
<p>The feeling inside the train car was the same as when I came, although once was in winter and the other was in early autumn (actually, it's still mid-summer in Jiangnan). After a night of turbulence, we arrived at Changchun.</p>
<p>Lonely, guarding my two pieces of luggage, sitting in the waiting room, my thoughts were transformed into countless memories of the past, present, and future, hopes, dreams, and even worries.</p>
<p>Before leaving Shanghai, I always dreamed of going to the north. Who knew this was just a dream, a dream of a lonely wanderer. Not only did I not gain or accomplish anything, but I returned south so hastily and embarrassingly. But the biggest question is what to do after returning south. Although I boldly said to my friends in the north, "(Enough, I don't want to stay in the north for another day. Let me go back to the south...)" But what will happen when I return to the south? This big and terrible question haunted me.</p>
<p>(Alas, don't go back to the south. There is nothing to pursue in the south. Friends are scattered, women have long forgotten you, this wandering person, and life is still a huge problem. Then turn back to Harbin, but that is absolutely impossible. Friends will fear you, this person with a nervous breakdown. How about going to Beijing? Perhaps there is a way to live in Beijing...)</p>
<p>However, in the end, I still bought a ticket to Dalian, because maybe I can settle down in Dalian. Didn't Lao Yang's letter say that there was food for me in Dalian? Alas, at this point, one can only look for food for each day.</p>
<p>Boarding the South Manchurian Railway, from the train window, I could see the green fields rushing past. This was different from the impression when I came.</p>
<p>Not far from me, in the seat, was a young Japanese woman. I don't know which station she got on at. She probably had hysteria, or maybe she was a romantic poet. She leaned alone against the window, holding a book in her hand, singing continuously, not Japanese songs, but Western tunes. She was not at all afraid of the gaze of the passengers. Her face was haggard, and her black hair was disheveled.</p>
<p>I spent the entire time on the train watching this young Japanese woman.</p>
<p>It was night, and the train arrived in Dalian. I thought maybe Lao Yang would come to meet me.</p>
<p>Walking out of the train and onto the platform, sure enough, Lao Yang and his new wife were waiting at the station.</p>
<p>I hired a horse-drawn carriage, and Lao Yang, his wife, and my luggage were all taken to Lao Yang's house.</p>
<p>"(Let your return journey south stop in Dalian, my friend)," Lao Yang said to me.</p>
<p>I was silent for a while.</p>
<p>"(I really can't predict my own life)."</p>
<h3>To Jiaxing</h3>
<p>— Yun He</p>
<p>The sky in the east gradually revealed a fish-belly white, and a patch of white clouds awaited the dyeing of the red sun. At this time, the alumni of the Sociology Department of Fudan University at the Fuxing Society had already climbed out of their very warm beds to prepare for departure.</p>
<p>However, things did not allow us to be very smooth. The students living on campus were still dreaming sweet dreams in their beds. When the friend leading this picnic realized this fact, they went to call them and her to get up until half-past six when they began to urge the car to proceed to the North Station.</p>
<p>This fact gave us a very bad result. When we arrived at the North Station, the whistle had already sounded, clearly telling us that the 7 o'clock express train would not allow us to board. The result of negotiating with the stationmaster was to change to the 9 o'clock express train to He.</p>
<p>Originally, this trip of ours was not purely a trip. The purpose was a picnic. As long as we could play together, we could at least satisfy our desires. So, the waiting room of the train station was temporarily occupied by us as a place for entertainment.</p>
<p>The lonely waiting room was now filled with amiable and happy air. A series of lively dramas will begin here.</p>
<h3>Female Students at the Misty Rain Tower</h3>
<p>After distributing biscuits and other food like relieving famine victims, we distributed bright flowers to everyone to put on their chests, so that everyone had a smile on their brows. One person suggested that everyone introduce themselves, so Mr. Zhao plagiarized and wrote:</p>
<p>"(I am Zhao Zilong of Changshan)." And Mr. Jin imitated Zhang Sheng's tone in The West Chamber and said:</p>
<p>"(My surname is Jin, my name is ×××, born on × month × day × hour, and I am not yet married)."</p>
<p>It elicited a burst of laughter.</p>
<p>There were two professors, twenty-seven male students, and nine female students on this trip.</p>
<p>It was already half-past eight, and we boarded the train one after another. The thirty-eight people were arranged on both sides of the carriage, as lively as chicks.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the loneliness of the journey, small games began. We divided the students into six groups according to the color of the flowers, and each group had to ask and answer each other once.</p>
<p>"(Mr. Ying, how old are you)?" A student asked.</p>
<p>"(Thirty-four)," our director replied.</p>
<p>"(What about Mrs. Ying)?"</p>
<p>"(Um, one year older)." The whole place laughed.</p>
<p>In another group:</p>
<p>"(Ah Lin, have you been married)?"</p>
<p>"(I have been married and have two children)."</p>
<p>"(What is the name of your wife)?"</p>
<p>"(She is called Huang Juhua)." Everyone laughed so hard they bent over.</p>
<p>The train passed Fanwangdu. Mr. Xiao Yuan pointed out his alma mater, St. John's University, and told us many stories. He returned to his youthful aspirations. He said in a bold tone:</p>
<p>"(The place where the trees are shaded is the football field. I was the Cheerleader during the ball games)."</p>
<p>"(The corner where the red building is located is St. Mary's Girls' School. I often went there to look for people)."</p>
<p>"(Who were you looking for)?" A student asked.</p>
<p>"(Looking for My Sister)." The tone revealed a flaw, and applause thundered.</p>
<p>Time passes most easily in laughter. Half-past eleven had arrived in Jiaxing. The weather was not good, and it was drizzling.</p>
<p>We entered a restaurant called Yanleyuan. We felt a little hungry, so we ate and chewed at the table. Someone in the meal suggested that everyone say a word, and it should be about their own shortcomings. Some said, "(I am missing a tooth)," some said, "(I am nearsighted)." The most solemn of these two sentences was:</p>
<p>"(I am old)," a female student said.</p>
<p>"(As for me, I feel very cold when I see women)," another male student said.</p>
<p>People all have their own memories and their own objects of sadness. No one's life passes without shortcomings.</p>
<p>After the meal, we bought a boat to tour the Misty Rain Tower. Looking out, the misty water was hazy, and the distant trees and fishing boats were faintly visible. In the ancient scenery, we were poets in the daytime.</p>
<p>Without words, without singing, wandering on the painted railings and long corridors, everyone's minds were surrounded by the sky full of misty rain, as if mourning this old tower.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao's poetic inspiration burst out, and he wrote on paper:</p>
<p>"(Mountain traces and wave shadows meet the lake's level, misty rain is bleak, seeing the ancient city repaired into mandarin ducks (note) cannot get a pair, I want to ask about the next life...)"</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao said, "(I won't continue writing)." This poem contained an unspoken past event.</p>
<p>The small boat drifted towards Luofan Pavilion. On the water journey from Misty Rain Tower to Luofan Pavilion, you can appreciate the famous products of Jiaxing that you admire. This can indeed dispel the loneliness of your journey.</p>
<p>Arriving at Luofan Pavilion, old trees like dragons cover the broken mausoleums and ruined palaces, and fine rain drips on the wutong trees.</p>
<p>In front of Li Bai's Hall, Mr. Xiao proposed to pay homage to the Drunken Old Man. Mr. Xiao loved excitement. He brought a belly full of poetry and wine to the world to seek excitement. No wonder he wanted to praise the banished immortal.</p>
<p>At four o'clock, we visited Xiuzhou Middle School. In the reception room, we learned that the school had been established for more than thirty years. It was said that it was established by the church. The principal was very attentive in leading us to visit the cleanliness of the dormitory and the silence in the library. I couldn't help but recall my past life and today's romance.</p>
<p>At seven o'clock, we took the train back. A fire dragon pierced through the darkness in the rain and brought us back to the palace of the metropolis.</p>
<p>We have returned, we only feel happy and joyful.</p>
<p>Finally, we said that Jiaxing, this old city in Jiangnan, can make us think of the scenery and heroic village songs and the graceful dances of beautiful women described in Ming and Qing novels. It seems that they are all swaying into one piece in the Qionglou Yuyu.</p>
<p>Jiaxing in the rain is indeed imprinted in the minds of our people, a vagueness that will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>Note (The location of Misty Rain Tower, South Lake, is also known as Mandarin Duck Lake)</p>

<h3>Forgot to Bring Money Shen Dongmei</h3>
<p>Her new life began. With the help of a friend, she packed her bags and went to Shanghai to study at a middle school.</p>
<p>These days, she didn't feel troubled. After paying for room and board, she had a ten-yuan bill left. Therefore, in the shortest possible time, she was able to show off a rich and generous scene. In front of many female students, their inexperienced minds thought she was a wealthy woman.</p>
<p>"(Although I am not considered wealthy in Shanghai, I am already unique in my town. My grandfather left me four thousand acres of land and many city houses. Half of the houses in my town are ours. We also opened twelve shops. At the end of each year, the rent, rice, house money, and interest received are truly uncountable. I am very comfortable at home. Now there are so many gangs, so I dare not wear silk clothes or wear valuable jewelry, although there are many of these things in my house)." She often used these words to tell the students all over the school. The students really believed her words.</p>
<p>But this mere ten yuan is easily used up. On the day it was completely used up, she felt depressed. However, soon she thought of a good method.</p>
<p>"Oh, I came out too hastily and forgot to bring money. What I am using now is what I accidentally found in my bag. Although I have written a letter to my family to ask for it, these few days have made me suffer. Like someone who is used to spending like me."</p>
<p>"(What's the big deal? I have dozens of dollars that I can lend you. It's good that your family sends money very quickly and easily)," every student said.</p>
<p>"(It's embarrassing, right? I've never borrowed money before)."</p>
<p>"(Haha, you are really a wealthy young lady. What's so embarrassing about borrowing temporarily? Indeed, in the eyes of a wealthy young lady, borrowing money is very shameful)." Every student thought it was a great honor to lend money to a wealthy young lady.</p>
<p>So she felt happy. As a result, she borrowed two or three hundred yuan from various students.</p>
<p>This was a strange thing. Her clothes were all replaced with new ones.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly. After a month, her money still hadn't arrived.</p>
<p>One afternoon, she sat on the bed in the bedroom, thinking silently, thinking silently. These days, the students were all suspicious of her. She was afraid, afraid that this paper tiger would be exposed, as if an unfortunate thing was about to befall her.</p>
<p>"(Someone is looking for you in the reception room)." She was suddenly startled by this crisp voice, but she didn't know who was looking for her.</p>
<p>She slowly ran to the reception room. "(Ah)." She let out a surprised and ashamed cry.</p>
<p>"(Oh, Yindi, last year because you wanted to make a short shirt, I pawned my several foot warmers. Now, now the term has expired and they are gone. What should I do? How will I keep warm this winter? Like someone as old as me, my child, you should always think of me, because pawning these foot warmers was for you)," an old woman in ragged clothes said with tears as soon as she saw her.</p>
<p>Her eyes went black, and the surrounding air was filled with mocking voices.</p>

<h3>Calligraphy and Painting News</h3>
<p>Yi Cheng Calligraphy and Painting Society declared that the establishment of the society was originally to promote art and propagate the works of artists. In addition to various exhibitions that have been held four times, the personal calligraphy and painting exhibition of Yang Du from Xiangtan is now being held. According to Mr. Yang's word Xizi, he is an apprentice of Xiangqi Old Man, and his poems, books, and paintings are called the three best. More than 50 pieces of calligraphy and painting currently displayed in the society are recent masterpieces. It has been determined that the sixth and seventh exhibitions will be continued by Bi Xiufang from Wujin and the Drama Calligraphy and Painting Association. At that time, the grand occasion will be easy to predict.</p>
<p>Yu Jianhua, a native of Lu Jumen, has a fondness for calligraphy and painting. He was imbued with family studies in his youth and became proficient in the six methods when he grew up. He used to study in Beijing under the late calligrapher Chen Shizeng, and he gained his heart. He liked to travel and his footprints were all over the north and south. Wherever he went, he must write with a pen and inkstone, wading through mountains and rivers, exhausting his secluded victory, and taking his natural chalk book to benefit the hills in his chest. What he saw was extensive and the artistic conception was beyond the comprehension of the ancients. He gained a great deal from the help of landscapes. He is proficient in all kinds of calligraphy, including regular script, cursive script, official script, and seal script. He is not limited by one family. He is especially good at bronze inscriptions, from Shang divination shells to Mao Gong Ding, San Shi Pan, Shi Gu Wen, Qin Quan and Han tiles. He is proficient in all of them. The iron paintings and silver hooks are like painting sand, like printing mud, like a broken hairpin, like a trace of house leakage. The ancient style is dense and lush, elegant and robust. The running cursive script is like Jin and Tang dynasties, swift and smooth, with the momentum of dragons soaring and phoenixes flying. The flower temple uses strong strokes and gorgeous colors to write the branches and leaves in the wind, and the buds are in full bloom, all of which exhaust the state of things. In addition to Qing Teng, Bai Yang, Futang and Nantian, a banner is set up. Landscapes initially learn from Shen Shitian, then learn from Mei Yuangong, and then come to Shanghai to make Gong Banqian famous at the time. More recently, they have been flooded with the works of various schools of Song and Yuan Dynasties, and they have explored the works of Shi Tao and Shi Xi especially carefully. Therefore, the works contain an attitude of ah na in the midst of vigor and strength, and an air of vigor and strength in the midst of elegance. They must take the essence of the ancients and not stick to the ancient appearance. In addition, the famous mountains and rivers that have been traveled to all over the world, the vast atmosphere of their opening and closing, rushes to the bottom of the wrist, so they can get rid of the constant path and surpass the current trends. He is proficient in writing and has a wealth of works. He is also proficient in Western methods and design. He is currently the director and professor of the Chinese Painting Department of Xinhua Art College. He is enthusiastic, so many scholars have become talents. He is also a class teacher in the liberal arts of the Patriotic Girls' School. He is young and strong, and his aspirations have not yet been realized. Who can measure his future achievements? Now it is scheduled to be held at the Xizang Ningbo Township Association for three days on the 15th, 16th and 17th of this month.</p>
<h3>Yu Jianhua's Landscape</h3>

If there are those with the same hobbies, they are also willing to sell them at a low price. Many people have visited them in recent days, and many paintings have been sold. Those who have a fondness for calligraphy and painting must not miss this good opportunity.</p>
<h3>Group News</h3>
<p>The North Sichuan Road Jingwu Sports Association has organized a tour group to travel to Kunshan to enjoy chrysanthemums and eat crabs. Although it has been raining continuously in recent days, there are still more than 100 members who have signed up to join. It is now scheduled to depart this morning at 7:30 on the Shanghai-Wuxi train. First, visit Ma'anshan, have lunch, and then visit the local famous gardens and visit the bee farm. The association, in view of the recent high prices of crabs in Yangcheng Lake, is sincerely afraid of being unprepared to purchase them temporarily. Therefore, it specially sent cadres to prepare in advance to avoid the occurrence of restraints at that time, which would reduce the enjoyment of the tour.</p>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA stated that in order to promote Chinese chess and promote national skills, the association has specifically scheduled to hold the second chess team player competition at 1:00 pm on the 16th of this month. It is calculated that each chess team is limited to one player. The elimination system will still be used as in previous years to divide the grades.

From now until November 16, the second phase of the class members will be recruited. All members and non-members of the association, regardless of gender, can sign up to join. The detailed rules and payment procedures can be inquired directly or by letter from the general office of the association.</p>

Also, one copy of the society's venereology costs three corners for return postage.</p>
<p>Doctor Huang Baoquan, a specialist in kidney diseases at No. 189 Guanqunfang, Nanjing Road, declared that this doctor invented the Yunzhi Yishu, which specializes in treating kidney failure and other diseases.

<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>Wujin doctor Xu Yixian declared that since this doctor opened a clinic in Minyuli, Nanjing Road, those who seek treatment have been crowded. Now, in view of the fact that poor people suffering from diseases are lying in bed and have no funds to seek medical treatment, they are suffering unspeakable pain. Therefore, in order to benefit the poor patients, from today onwards, they will provide medical treatment for one month. Regardless of internal and external medicine, acupuncture, throat, ophthalmology, and strange diseases, medical treatment will be provided. Only two corners will be charged for the number, and there will still be outpatient service in the afternoon.</p>

<p>(1) General Uriburu, the Provisional President of Argentina (*) being welcomed by the crowd during a victory parade in the City of Silver, after overthrowing the government of Irigoyen. Seated to his right is Colonel Marile, who supports Uriburu.</p>
<p>In South America, three armed revolutions have occurred in succession in the recent mid-March. The presidents of Bolivia (Salas), Peru (Leguia), and Argentina (Irigoyen) have been successively overthrown. Other Central and South American countries are also brewing trouble, and there is a danger of imminent explosion. The reason is not political but economic. In a word, it is due to the low value of exported goods. This is especially true in Argentina for meat and grains. Because the republics of the Americas are interspersed with conflicting parties and factions, and the United States of North America uses economic expansion to promote Pan-Americanism, thereby manipulating and oppressing them. The government has no good way to remedy this during this time of worldwide overproduction and surging unemployment. Those in the fields have something to use as an excuse, and storms are rising.</p>
<p>(2) A view of the Mayo Palace of the Brazilian government from a foreign platform. In front is the Independence Memorial, with a white flag already hung on top.</p>
<p>(3) Dr. Irigoyen, President of Argentina, was originally a history teacher. In 1902 and 1905, he was the leader of revolutions. In 1916 and 1928, he was re-elected twice. Now, due to the revolutionary wave, he was forced to resign on September 6. The government and congress were dissolved and replaced by a military government.</p>
<p>(4) Bolivian students gathered in front of the statue of General Stone on June 4 to commemorate his death anniversary. A cabinet member wanted to address them, but they shot at him, and the revolutionary storm began in the capital.</p>

However, the new government rises and falls quickly, causing losses to overseas Chinese shops.</p>

<h3>A Visit to Petrarch's Spring</h3>
<p>— Hua Lin</p>
<p>The Italian poet who initiated the Renaissance, Petrarch (1304-1374), was born in Arezzo, Italy. His father, a member of the White faction, was exiled abroad. The poet traveled around and met a beautiful woman named Laura in Avignon, southern France, and fell deeply in love with her. He then wrote love poems to praise her. The poetry collection is divided into two volumes: Before and After Laura's Death. The sorrowful and lingering feelings in the latter volume are even more exquisite. The poet chose to live near the spring of Vaucluse in the mountains near the famous city of Avignon. This spring is under a cliff. The old spring has dried up, leaving traces. The new spring gushes out from the chaotic rocks, stirring up snow-white waves and forming a long, winding path. There is the fragrance of flowers on both banks of the stream. Beside the stream is Petrarch's former residence. Ancient books are displayed in the room, and a portrait of the beautiful Laura adorns the walls. This shows that the poet's life was turbulent and displaced, and he cherished the sorrow of the country's demise. He suffered the same unfortunate fate as Dante. The world is surging forward in pursuit of power, and there is no one to share a word with. Only the illusion of beauty can be used to tell his secrets and entrust his deep feelings. In addition, there is the clear spring in the valley, and the wind and moon in the mountains. The poet soothes and adds color to the mountains and lakes with his constant singing. When I visited the Avignon Art Museum, I saw broken columns and drooping willows in the courtyard, which are Laura's tomb. I couldn't bear to leave, so I looked back and transformed into spring mud to accompany this ancient tomb. I am willing to transform into a cuckoo, constantly singing in the willow branches. Because of the poet, the beautiful Laura, and the spring of Vaucluse, it is immortal.</p>
