<p>此次國聯所召開之行政院會議。第一案爲委託統洽委員會之巴力斯坦問題。可見國聯對於該問題之重視矣。據芬外長宣讀之議案。謂對委員報告與英國答辯。雙方兼顧。其實所謂雙方兼顧者。質言之即無法解决而不得不出於調和之謂也。然而調和亦甚難。蓋巴力斯坦自經歐戰由土耳其分出後即爲英國之委任統治地。猶太人最初。欲在巴力斯坦獨建一猶太民族之國家阿剌伯人以其侵奪權利。極力反對。因此意見相左。自一九二零年耶路撤冷發生暴動。兩方在行政上即不能合作。至去年爲一座泣牆回猶兩敎復發生極大衝突。惡感愈深。更無和平調解之可能。而英國對之。旣不能援助何方。亦不能得罪何方。嚴厲强斷之手段。旣不敢用。而適當解决之方法亦無從施今雖有鼓勵猶太人之意。而仍未能减兩方之爭。此所以延至今日而糾紛未已也。至以另一方面言之。回猶兩族所盼望之脫離英國委託統治而獲得獨立地位。更爲杳渺不可能之事。因巴力斯坦接近蘇彝士運河。在軍事上交通上均佔重要區域。英國旣獲得此委託統治權。當然不肯輕易放棄故巴力斯坦之亂事。雖非爲對英而發。然英旣無法以調解猶太人與阿刺伯人之爭而又無術以滿猶太人與阿刺伯人之始願捨此而欲求得一妥善辦法實爲難之尤難者。行政院果有若何至公允之方法。以解决此久懸不决之問題乎國内要電二</p>

<p>丨第一戰一對二敗於星聯再戰三對二獲勝丨</p>
<p>（八月二十七星洲通訉）香港中華足球隊南來初試啼聲、繼逢勁敵星聯、第一次交鋒在八月二十五日、老虎身落平陽、竟遭狗欺、以一對二失敗於星聯手中、第二次於二十六日會面、星聯垂頭喪氣、退避三舍、被中華以三對二擊倒、勝負相等、中華華與星聯、誠可謂一對難兄難弟矣、兩戰經過如左、</p>
<h3 id="c103">（一）中華初試星聯 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>結果一對二失敗</p>
<p>二十四日乃香港中華足球隊南來後初試啼聲之日、該隊（老虎）之綽號、早已震動、南邦人士、咸引領而望（老虎）之絶技、惟對方星聯、其隊員皆一時俊彥、星後防有亞九之（一夫當關）前鋒有馬來之神頭神足、中華遠征足球隊前次遇之、亦曾痛失三球、其威武由此可以槪見、今中華隊方一開旗、即逢此勁敵、於是盼望虎門之人士、遂分外熱鬧、球場四週、幾舞立釒之地、昨日下午二時以後、曾雨下許久、關心此戰者、咸爲之神沮、幸即放晴、陽光照耀、開場前絡繹於途之觀衆、盡嘉形於色、躋躋蹌蹌、惟恐後至、乃激戰之時、天又下雨、大部份觀衆、以露天鵠立、衣履爲之盡濕、有則以紙當傘、暫以躱避、而健兒們之雨中表演、更深印吾人之腦府矣、記者於四時十分驅車前往、但見安順律中、人潮起伏、實地典内、殺氣騰天將近場門時、瞥見老虎隊員數人、乘胡文虎先生之老虎汽車、至車上旗幟飄揚、極爲壯觀、抵步後、晤中華領隊葉九皋君、詢悉曹桂成君、因病不能出席、李鴻清代之、陳光耀君則如期趕至、二隊陣線如左、</p>
<p>中華隊</p>
<p>陳光耀</p>
<p>黎郁達　阿佐賢　孫錦順</p>
<p>陳錫培　　　　　黄瑞華　黄柏松</p>
<p>梁玉堂　黎國釗　何家强</p>
<p>李鴻清</p>
<p>星聯隊</p>
<p>亞九（華）　玉書（華）　丁紐史（江）</p>
<p>瑞老（英）民　宏（華）</p>
<p>羅華達（馬）</p>
<p>努力的（英）都　拉（馬）</p>
<p>末怒（馬）</p>
<p>亞耀（華）坤　安（華）</p>
<p>勢甚危殆　四時五十分、中華健兒、由隊長黎郁達率領、由人叢中衝出、隊員黄衣黑袖白褲、奔膛場中、驟視之儼如一羣黄斑猛虎、觀衆急報以掌聲、旋星聯隊繼之趨出、青衣白褲、精神弈弈、公證人華威盧君、遂召二隊代表、决定場位、繼二隊健兒集隊攝影、影相員一打、大肆活躍攝畢中華隊高呼口號、聲勢爲之一壯、戰期已届、殺機乃啟、是時雨後新晴、景物如洗、天半彩虹一彎、絢爛奇麗、開場不五分、中華前鋒、率球直上、一舉足間、球趨至門、勢甚危殆、幸亞九鎭定將手一揮、球去如矢、不久雨絲飄飄、露天觀衆、爲之氣沮</p>
<p>未曾中的　嗣後星聯馬來前鋒、加倍努力、坤安民宏竭力合作、球多在中華門前、曾二度遇險、俱被陳錫培救出、兩方健兒表演俱佳、觀衆大喜過望、至第一場將完場時、中華被罰自由球、由端老主踢、球發即被中華隊員一擋、未曾中的忽而公證人銀角一聲、以不分勝負完結第一場、</p>
<p>重整旗鼓　五分鐘之檸檬時間過去後、二隊換場、戰機又啟、球盤旋中華門前、時多拉與羅華達盤球直上、末腦一截、正擬向門直射、銀角忽鳴、球雖鑽入中華門内、然太遲矣、空踢一場、殊可惜也、戰至五時五十分、球由中華中堅傳至前鋒孫錦順、舉足命射、亞九見球危急、早已佈防、球來時輕輕一接、隨足踢去、乃化險爲夷、雙方戰約五十分鐘、尙未分勝負、觀衆以中華隊如此英勇、是日之戰或將不分勝負矣、</p>
<p>如失投壼　不料至五十二分鐘時、星聯民宏、帶球衝入敵陣、即傳與羅華達、羅得球後即向敵門射去、如失投壼應聲入網、中華乃負第一球焉、戰至六時、黄柏松得球、被玉書一推、球走出界外、然玉書因此犯規、被罰十二碼球　、由孫錦順主蹋、是時之亞九獨守空門、形單影隻、孫擇定價標蹋去、球成不治之症、爆竹之聲大起、乃慶祝中華之恨復一球也、觀衆之歡呼聲、響徹遐邇、中華隊之得民心、有如此者、</p>
<p>二與一比　是時也、旣以一與一比成和局、且時間又僅有五分鐘、若中華堅持下去、則雙方俱將與和平之神接吻、然天下事、未必盡如人意、至完場前二分鐘、中華又被星聯多拉攻入一球、爲二與一比、中華雖欲反攻、時不我與、至六時十分鐘、長笛一聲、觀衆蜂起、激起戰事、乃告完結、於是二比一、中華宣告敗績、</p>
<p>表演甚佳　觀是役之戰、中華隊員之表演甚佳、其實力似在遠征隊之上、可惜曹（性成吳（錦泉）抱病、不能出塲、前鋒缺一飛將軍、未免稍呈軟弱、而孫錦順亦似李惠堂之出戰、不喜追奔奪球、故昨日難於取勝、若非一十二碼之間球、則中華又難免與遠征隊同遭惡運矣、所幸内衛堅固、尤以梁玉堂一足可人、頗爲觀者所贊、雖無吳錦泉、亦未見其力弱也、</p>
<h3 id="c104">（二）再戰星聯獲勝 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>結果三對二</p>
<p>香港中華足球隊、於二十七日作第二次之出戰、與戰者初本爲西聯、後因他種關係、再易爲星聯故其陣線略有變改、華人之長萬、亦已加入作戰、而中華隊則因陳曹已赴棉蘭、左右翼不能不以麥李替之、中鋒黄柏松因前戰傷腰、至今未愈、不克出塲、故昨日應戰之中鋒、已改由何家强担任、而何之内輔一職、則由梁榮達充當、昨日於陣勢擺定後、一班華人觀衆、即多爲中華担憂、以爲陳曹他去、已似折臂、今再加黄之缺席、勢將較前次之前鋒、更爲軟弱、然結果適得其反、昨日之表演、不特比前更佳、而且尙以三比二、擊敗星聯、挽回已失之令譽、</p>
<p>相持不下　戰端開始、時球即飛來飛去、東西莫定、人亦跑去跑來、攻守咸力、兩軍相持、各不相讓、中華隊因左翼軟弱、失機頗多、截球不能、攻門亦不準確、遂致數次臨門之球、均失之俄傾、說者於嘆惜之餘、均憶曹陳以爲有飛將軍與火車頭在、當不致有此之失也、而萬人盼望稱能之孫錦順、則因身體大、舉動稍爲遲鈍、惟盤球爭球、則尙有獨到之處非人所及、</p>
<p>一隊柱石　何家强不愧爲一隊之柱石、在當日一戰、表演尤佳、中華獲勝之三球、除一球因星聯門前危急、守門員撲地救施不及、其後衛恐被孫趕至怱忙一足將球蹋入自網外、餘均爲何所獲功、其第一係於上半塲十分鐘時所踢入、第二球則於下半塲五十分鐘時、由右翼傳至門前、由何家强用頭一頂而入其頂球時之姿勢有如蕪子翻身、尤爲觀衆所叫絶、惟除得三球外、中華亦再無進展之餘地矣、</p>
<p>聯絡見長　星聯則因始終奮鬥、其前鋒之衝鋒蹈陣、勇猛異常、盤球截球、均非中華可及、而聯絡尤佳故上半塲雖以零比一兄收、而下半塲尙得以二比二見和、若非後衛威爾遜之自誤、則或不致宣告敗績矣、</p>

<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>赤脚運動。本刋曾有記載。上海早有一部分時髦女子。赤着脚在馬路上走了。而在外國。女子赤脚已成俗尙。入夏以來。乃没有一個漂亮女子不赤脚。亦可見赤脚之受人歡迎呀。頃閱西報。見有關於赤脚之趣聞數則。亟爲譯而出之。以供讀者一粲。</p>
<p>因赤脚女傭被開除　最近在柏林的勞工法院裏。（勞工法院是專辦勞資間之糾紛案件）受理了一件極有趣味的案件。原告是一個女傭。伊在五月間爲被告所雇。在被告家裏充女僕。當時訂有一年的契約。不相居一星期前。忽被被告辭歇。故請救濟。法院就問爲什麽被辭歇。被告說。因爲伊常常赤脚。不懂禮貌。故而主人把伊開除。原告就加以抗辯。說請堂上當心現在的赤脚風潮。在大街上。在宴會上。漂亮的女子那一個不脚。難道伊們都不懂禮節嗎。我以女傭。買不起襪子。乘勢就赤起脚來。竟因此而被辭歇。豈不寃枉。又我在被告家裏帮傭。天天換衣裳。十分清潔。只少穿了一雙襪。就編派我的不是。違反合同。請堂上憑公判結。承審的法官。聽了這番話。很以爲然。他當時曾說。赤脚並不是惡德。何况現在又是盛行一時的俗尙。就是他（法官）自已呢。有時也喜歡赤脚。他的女兒到外邊去也時常赤脚。所以赤脚並不晃違反禮貌的舉動。更不能藉之以爲辭歇女僕的理由。被告聽了這番話。心想這次官司。一定有輸無贏。當即聲明自願和解了事。</p>
<p>女戲子赤脚難上臺　女子赤脚的風潮旣已盛極一時。戲館裏女戲子就也學起時髦來。赤着脚上臺了。最近倫敦有一位舞臺老板呌做瓊司的。他忽然出了一張通告。禁止女伶們赤脚上臺。有人問他禁止的理由。他說理由是没有。只不過出脚上臺難看而已。女子在街上走。脚在底下不着襪。本來没有什麽關係。但是衆目昭彰的高臺上。假使也赤脚。那末看起來似乎有點觸目。這位老板的通告。眞正有點意思。又講到女子赤脚。據普通人的論調。有幾樣益處。第一是舒適。因少一雙襪。就是少了一層束縛。第二是經濟。女人的絲襪。一雙的代價。有至二十五塊錢者。那末不穿襪豈不是根本節省了許多錢嗎。第三是天眞。不穿襪。露出了雙脚本來的面目。豈不是又增加了一點曲線之美嗎。第四假使在嗄天。是風凉。但是反過來說。一到冬天。赤脚的事。就成了一個問題。</p>

<p>芡實糕　新鮮芡實。剥去其殻。置石臼中。用杵搗爛。和冰糖屑。鍋上煑之成糕。甘美紹倫。</p>

<p>— 蘭茜</p>
<p>我們貴國人生下一月之後。便由家長們很仔細地取下一個專名。這專名如果在一生之中不遇若何變故—名譽上受到損失。政治舞臺上失意或竟受過通緝之類—是不大肯更改的。許多莫明其妙的爲人父母者。把自已的兒女呌作阿猫阿狗阿毛阿猪。或者是阿金阿銀阿寳阿玉那些俗不可耐的名字外。其他千千萬萬也不知有多少人相同的。前外交部長曾有一位陳友仁。但在路局通譯課裏也有一位陳友仁。爲着服務機關不同。風馬牛不相及。則不必你改我改了。但是。說起來有趣。就在兩路員司中。却已找出十個佃來。每兩人分用着一個完全相同的尊名尊姓。比方。京滬車務中段段長室司事和兩路駐處車務總段者同名（陳永清）。隨車行李員和南京電務員同名（王希賢）。庶務股侍役吳阿二和奔牛站站役同。張華浜分路夫周榮生和常州站行李司事同。南京分路夫劉二和南京江邊站站役同。這事發現後。管理局深以爲不便。刻已下令着五人改名。免掉混淆之煩云云。</p>
<p>這一點。我們應該承認管理局之細心之無微不至。但我還得向這五人饒舌一回。改起名字來時。切要把職員錄細翻一過。莫學（避風避到雪）。改出來的名字走不了（善與人同）。數千同事。在這兒有厚望焉。</p>

<p>— 膽瓶室主</p>
<p>近來凈角人材。已日益寥落。銅錘一門。更有才難之嘆。架子花臉。雖較爲廣博。惟佳材亦不多覯。以寬格論之。南北梨園行。可得二人焉。二人爲誰。即南之金少山北之郝壽臣是也。郝爲已故名凈黄三之嫡傳弟子。氣魄雄厚。衷氣充沛。演劇時全神貫注。不稍苟且。故一劇有一劇之精采。一劇有一劇之特色。享盛名十餘載。未嘗稍受挫折。今則駸駸日上。已有執凈角牛耳之趨勢矣。少山爲凈角泰斗金秀山之子。自幼專習架子。近來對於銅鍾一道。亦頗肯專心學習。如探陰山黑風帕斷太后上天台二進宮諸劇。唱來韻味雋永。居然有乃父風骨。淵源有自。畢竟勝人一籌也。前年蓓開唱片公司成立。對於南北名伶。邀灌殆遍。壽臣少山二角。當然亦在網羅之中。壽臣生性怪僻。本有不灌片之主張。後經知友再三慫恿。始允破例一試。及唱片發行。壽臣開聽一過。忽拍案狂呼曰。早知有如此成績。灌灌又何妨耶。聞壽臣之言。可以知蓓開工程師技術之精良矣。壽臣共灌四片。一忠孝全。一打龍棚打曹豹。一除三害。一夜審潘洪。審潘係二黄戲。韵味最厚。忠孝全除三害二片。有唱有念。尤生動多姿。雙打一片。有二黄。有西皮。搭配更爲合宜。故嗜者亦獨衆也。少山除與譚小培富英父子合灌全本（捉放）（搜孤救孤）外。另灌（覇王别姬）（法門寺）（與富英合）（黄金台）（與小培合）（審李七）四片。俱爲其生平傑作。大氣磅礴。淵淵金石。（黄鐘大呂）之喻。唯少山當之。可無愧色焉。</p>

<h3 id="c164">戰後波蘭之内政（三） <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 黎六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>新憲法所規定之地方自治制。本當在同一基礎上施行於各處。但各地在憲法成立前所採用之種種不同之法制。一時未能革去。於是立法者第一步工作乃在消除各地差異之最顯著者。並使以前未經享受自治之地。同沾利益。臨時政府特令舊俄屬波蘭舉行自治。即其一例。蓋以前德屬波蘭與奥屬波蘭因適用德奥法律。早已享受地方自治。而俄屬波蘭獨感向隅也。</p>
<p>故現在波蘭各處地方自治完全在諸種不同之基礎上施行。並未有一劃一之制度。舊德屬Hante-Bilesie地方。因一特别法令之規定。其自治權限比較特别廣泛。可爲明證。</p>
<p>在此情形下。現在波蘭行政統一之賴以維持者。不爲法律本身。而爲執行中央政權之各地方官吏。因各地方官吏如知郡知鎭等。可由中央任意調至彼郡。由舊德屬波蘭調至舊俄屬波蘭。毫無限制。</p>
<p>波蘭行政統一之設置固不易矣。而其司法統一尤爲困難。波蘭全國有五種不同之司法制度。在發梭微（波京）區域則適用拿破侖法。在東部各省則適用俄羅斯法。其餘各處則分别採用德奥匈等國法律。民法固如是。民事訴訟法。商法。刑法等莫不皆然。故當波蘭復國之時。對於家族權。抵押制度。司法證據以及輕罪認别等之規定。此處與彼處完全不同。</p>

<p>第十四回　翠竹涙斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離</p>
<p>四十多歲的人。討姨太太。在中國以爲極正當的事。章乙青所以能引動翠筠的心。敎伊情願嫁他的。主不是有一件事。他常常和伊說。翠筠。我不瞞你。我家裏是有一個老婆的。但是這個老婆。如同没有一樣。因爲伊是一個鄉下人。只配住在寗波鄉下。不配住到上海來的。所以我在上海做了二十多年生意。伊也不曾來過一次。他們住慣在鄉下的。到這上海來也不慣。不過一年兩年。我回寗波鄉下去看他們一回。你要不相信。問我的朋友好了。你要跟了我。我們在上海租房子住。每個月裏。我也要上船跑漢口一兩趟。我們一同去觀玩長江風景。豈不是好。他雖則如此說。翠筠却知道寗波人稱老婆爲老人。那寗波老人都是很厲害的。上一節工夫。伊的隔壁房間有一位小姐。做了一個客人。也是寗波人。不知怎麽洩漏春光。被他的老人知道了。即一天。這個客人恰巧住在隔壁生意上。被伊探聽明白。一清早起來踏門捉。他們兩人還在鴛鴦交頸。猛不防被伊闖進了房間裏。從被窩裏把兩人抱起來。伊不敢打自已的男人。却把那位小姐。一頓巴掌。頭髮也扯身的毛。伊的丈夫看不過。也把伊打了一下。伊就在地上一滾。哭着喊着。說我不要活了。你帮着濫污貨。打自已的老人。喊巡捕。一同到巡捕房裏去。那個寗波女人眞潑辣。在地板上一陣子亂滾。滾重頭髮也散了。褲子也卸下來了。一時樓上樓下。三四個房間廟的相帮做手。都擠上來瞧熱閙。伊的男人。看看太不像樣。着着好衣裳。一溜烟跑了。許多房間裏人。做好做歹。說你們男人也不在這裏。你在這裏。還閙什麽。我們是掛牌子招接客人。工部局裏收捐的正黨營業。並不晃到馬路上去拉了你男人來的。你自已不能管好你的男人。却到此地來胡閙。再不走。我們就一同到巡捕房去。你也不見得占着便宜。伊一看男人也走了。纔挽了一挽頭髮。東了一東褲帶。連駡帶嚷的走下樓去。雇了一輛黄包車自去。那位隔壁房間的小姐。覺得坍了一個檯。閙了這樣的笑話。自已還吃了那種苦頭。不好意思見人了。冷不防吃了生鴉片烟。幸虧施救得早。纔救了性命。</p>

<p>因爲汽車事業日進千里。和汽車有關係的種種。也隨之而日形發皇最顯明的。便是汽車服務站。關於汽車站服務的話。本刋已有不少的討論。如今美國又所謂（超服務站）（Super　Servise　Station）的組織。内容愈加科學化。現在姑以兩個實例。來闡明這個汽車新產物。</p>
<p>超服務站的最初成功者。是本薛文尼州的羅蘭汽車公司。羅蘭公司有二個偉大建築。一所是五層樓。一所是三層樓。佔全城中心。而且面積達一三八·○○○方尺。公司原是經售客車的。璧克·馬克往·開笛立克等都由他經售的。目前他把重心。由售車而轉移到超服務站上去了。他在廣告上說。這所超服務站是世界上最大而最完備的。以事實論。確也當之無愧。公司秘書百羅柯說。一超服務站也可稱爲（一停）何爲一停（One-stop）呢。便是無論什麽車子來。小壞　也好。大修也好。配件也好。製造也好。凡到這裏來。包可一手辦妥。不必再到第二家去理楚。不是（一停）之後。不用再停嗎。）</p>
<p>五層樓房現在是專管售車。三層樓房却專做超服務站的。三所房子雖然把工作劃分得很清楚。然而凡是一輛汽車要進出售車處的。必定要經過超服務站。大門在左邊。進去便是會計和蓄電池房。右面　。是公司總理的辦公處。超服務站就在裏面。第一件是洗車機。採用極新式的機件、第二件是試騐制動機和滑潤機。同時又安置着車胎和電池修理機。房間裏的光綫異常明晰。修理起來。也用不着燈光。在二層樓上有一所漆車處。修理間的面積。約摸九六零零方尺。在滑潤處的門上。用大字寫着標語說。（潤君之車。）</p>
<p>超服務站是五月三日纔開張的。那時候正是公司的二十五週成立紀念　。二十五年來。公司居然成爲西本薛文尼的第一大公司了。說起公司的歷史。却也有趣。一九零七年開辦時地位還不到如今的一半。一九一二年六月纔買了些地皮。一九一六年纔建成了二所房屋。　二年以後。公司事務發展。又將房屋翻造。自從超服站成功以後。營業愈出愈妙。大家因爲他有完美的設備。都把所有事務付托給他。他—超服務站—眞是汽車的慈母了。</p>
<p>第二個倒是在加利福尼亞州。公司名稱爲（加州意義）（Calideu）。他的超服務站。建築得十分奇特。機器有汽車·潤車·試制車·試車燈等。除此而外。還有飮食店剪髮店·美術店等備車主享用。（加州意義）公司主人說。（現在車主所最注重的。不在乎修理。而在乎維持。所謂維持。便是汽車潤車試車車類。事實告訴我們。車主買車時。第一年所費。修理僅及維持的三四分之一。三年以後。修理費便漸漸加重。然而那時已成爲舊車了。售車人設立服務站。對於事主。尤有無限利便。售車人明瞭車主的情形。在一定期間。還是免費更理。本公司所着重的。便是這一點。自從超服務站成立以還。結果異常圓滿。我們更進一步的努力前去。）</p>
<p>總之。超服務站的不同於普通服務站的。約有二大端。第一。超服務站範圍較大。設備較全。第二超服務站能應付顧客一切事務。無論損害的情形怎樣。他一手能</p>

<p>整理好。所以又稱爲（一停）制。汽車界自有了超張務站組織以來。大家爲節省時間計。都將車子付托給他。他更以慈母愛護孩子們的心來維護汽車。如是相得益彰。而改設超服務站的聲浪。已漸漸遍了全美了。（九·七·於交通大學）</p>

<p>— 嘯圓</p>
<p>西北一區。自綏遠迤西北連蒙古西南與新甘陜三省交界。占地幾萬里。一片荒凉。地廣人稀。物產之富。地藏之博。殊爲天政之區。往往引起外人覬觎之心。恒思染指。自赤俄侵略蒙古。邊陲之勢日亟。壓迫驟來。遂動國人戒懼之念。近來私人方面或圑體尙有組織西北遊歷圑者。但爲交通不便。遍地萑苻。官廳方面。又往往危言聳聽。不負安全之責。遂使壯志漫遊者。其結果不過西抵包頭。近即王嬙之墓（綏遠城有王昭君墓日明妃塜）而已。至於五原沃野之他。河套水草之區。以及蒙旗部落。邊氓生活情狀。悉因交通梗塞。無從涉履其間。以親見目覘。竟實地調查之功。然以私人圑體。居然關心荒漠。其雄心偉魄。已足令人欽佩驚服。况自茲以來。而經營西北之風說。忽於沉寂之間。不期然復大囂於故都塵上。雖實見未必有期。第經此一番提倡。亦足以表示吾民固未嘗一日忘西北也。并以促政府官家之注意焉。所可惜者。私人圑體。終嫌力量薄弱。僅能爲一時的奔走呼號則可。其後盾仍須强有力之政府。第今日政府因時局之多艱。并財源之拮据。内地建設。猶多欲罷不能。安有餘力兼顧其他。終令萬里富饒之地。永無開發之日。卒成棄置。事外人以垂涎之機會。致國内熱心者。反無策略以聞問。興言及此。能不浩嘆。近聞李涵楚主席頗能振作有志經營。最近於阿陶旂（在五原西）立局設治。局長高子千之。與余有故。頗不庸碌。將來經營建設於荒凉沙漠茂草繁林間。立一光榮奇績。增民國上一個無尙光華之紀念。則西北前途。庶幾乎有望。</p>
<p>經營西北之唯一政策。惟有設治之後。從速移民。民移則邊實。一方獎勸墾植。開發地藏。一面提倡牧畜。銷擴皮毛。果然者。則一年之後。西北產物及其出品。定可增加。而西北之收入。即過以養西北之民而有餘。國家西顧。亦無財政困難之慮。然移民政策。首重交通。交通不備。則匪患莫從消弭。土匪不靖。民不敢來。即來亦不能安。不安則不能久。今日來。明日去。與不移民初何以異。交通設計。雖有種種。但如擇要先施。則莫大於行旅之安全及其便利之鐵道事業。惟是萬里荒郊。其綫路之計畫。旣非偬促時光。可以立辦。而資財一項。尤想非今日政府之所能及。即便利用平綏。以延伸至定口或寗夏。雖爲長不過千餘。然而鐵軌機車。其所費亦不輕省。心籌默計。豈是易辦之事。更以國庫空虚如此。談何容易。求其次者。厥惟汽車。蓋汽車資本較輕。修路亦易。其餘條件。亦頗簡單。故據吾理想所見。西北交通。最先必從汽車入手。庶幾事輕易舉。易於觀成。若必計畫鐵路。固是根本計畫。至其結果。則又須借外債矣。</p>
<p>昔馮煥章督辦西北邊防時。駐軍包頭（綏西平綏鐵道最末之處。對於西北交通。亦嘗銳意籌畫。其計畫原案。本欲沿後套至定口。爲一幹路。再跨河套至寗夏。再成第二幹路。由此兩幹路。然後分向五層臨河苦水湖等處。成若干支路。俟支路成功。而後再向内蒙各重要部落。成若干短路。仍匯總於兩幹路之綫。計畫不爲不偉。且已移兵興工。雖慘淡經營。而數月之間。其工程已完大半。决心上亦不可謂無極大之毅力。孰料財源拮据。國又多事。未及觀成。馮已去國。迨南口失意。全軍西退。所有汽車。悉數供長途軍需之運。西駛之後。迄不復返。而數月苦心孤詣。費若干健兒血汗所成之汽車路。亦俱被退軍之車馬輪蹄。蹂躪殆盡。近數年綏遠當局。雖亦有所計畫。第軍事時期。地方財政。尤感艱難。行政建設。尙多力有不逮。荒漠交通。更談不到矣。官旣無力。商更不前。人民裏足。盜匪蜂聚。殺人越貨。日有所聞。行旅尤有戒心。而西北之荒凉。或更有甚於當年。遂使絶好農畜之塲。天府富饒之地。一任外人垂涎染指。競施其侵略野心。書曰匹夫無罪。懷璧其罪。强鄰虎視耽耽。已足使多難之國民。提心弔胆。若數年之内。仍無整個之具體計畫。吾恐西北邊患。正有難言之痛。</p>
<p>西北已有之交通。由來所賴者。僅有平綏鐵路。西抵包頭而已。由包頭以西而南。尙可利用後套之航行。至於趨向。西北則舍牛馬脚力外。初無其他辦法。航行上水逆風之時。非二十日以上之日程。不能由包頭達定口。至牛馬脚力。則尤不可恃。天氣佳無風雨。則馬一日長途。不得過百里。牛則六十里上下而已。汽車雖日行五百里。長途風雪。小雨不足爲害。兩相比較。汽車一日之程。可與馬牛爲一與五或十之比較。與航船足成一與十五之比較。時間上已有如此之利。並經濟上亦自有相等之便宜。交通旣便。則地方一切均感便利。内地居民及商賈。自可不招自來。西北事業。豈可限量。此雖近於理想。然推之實際。何嘗不如是。於是知汽車之於西北。不特在將來開發上有相當之慣値。即目前之商旅往返去來於廿陜綏西之間。亦實有構通之性能也。</p>
<p>汽車於西北交通。固占有相當地位。惟業此者皆以本取利之商家。血本攸關。誰肯虚擲。當此匪氛未靖。沿途荆莽。官廳如無相當辦法。予以切實保障。第恐商家投資。不能毫無顧憲。故西北交通。又必須先由剿匪入手。匪盡則交通無阻。商民可以無戒心。西北可以大發達。業汽車者亦自踴躍投資矣。愚意以爲此時正宜官家盡力剿匪。一面分兵修路。一方計畫移民。另籌數十萬鉅金。組織交通簡便的機關。許商家投資合辦。官處於監督之地。其盈餘商固有所應得。官則取以養路。如此籌計。庶幾可久。商亦無法居奇。以魚肉行旅。行旅有便利之頌。官商無　本之虞。交通發達。或其有望。</p>

<p>— 悟非</p>
<p>皖省安蕪蚌三市。雖以經濟困難。而路政進行。仍屬突飛猛進。近來如安慶市馬路之增建。蕪湖市馬路之修拓。蚌埠市街道之寬展。對於市容方面。甚爲關係。爰分述如次。</p>
<p>安慶市增建四達車站兩馬路　現因安潛太路通車。路線日有進展。行人日衆。新市之繁盛。已肇其始基。又以發展東郊外新市區。爲安市新生命所託。而新市區之發展。又以溝聯舊市爲不可或緩之圖。其擬建之四達車站兩路。即爲實行此計劃之後盾。查四達路長八十五尺寬三十八尺。所有路基·路牙石·水管·路面·城濠暗溝·人行道等六項工程。實需洋三千元零六角。車站路長五十尺寬三十八尺。其路基·路牙石·水管·路面·城濠暗溝·人行道等六項工程。實需洋二千六百零四元二角五分。較之四達。所費稍鉅也</p>
<p>蕪湖市修造北馬路與寬拓街道　蕪湖市以自鐵佛寺起。至海關碼頭止一段。路綫極狹。現由市工務局設計開築。自電燈公司起。至海關碼頭止。包括北馬路及原中江路。計長一千五百公尺。其工程分兩段。第一段自鐵佛寺前起。至星五里前止。共計塡土方二千三百四十二英方。第二段係自山東路口起至原中江路恒升里前止。共計塡土四千八百九十二英方。塡土工程。係用輕便鐵路輸送。所有輕便鐵軌軌枕鐵釘及運土鐵車。均由局供給。惟舖軌工作。則由承包人負擔。又以二街一帶。路綫爲蕪市交通孔道。而路面窄狹。溝渠淤塞。亟應分别拓寬疏濬。以重路政。規定二街道寬度爲五十英尺。並定中間車道爲三十英尺。兩旁人行過。各寬十六英尺。蓋以市政設施。首重道路。匪特市容整齊有關。抑且爲商務進展所繫。故將窄狹之二街。拓寬而疏濬之云。</p>
<p>蚌埠市改訂拓寬街道辦法　蚌市取締市民房屋之建築。向係依照公安局呈奉核准之取締建築規則辦理。茲以原訂規則。尙欠完備。爰根據市組織法之規定。參考南京市拓寬街道辦法。並參酌蚌市情形。由工務局擬定拓寬街道退讓房屋暫行章程八條。經市政籌備處核准公布。並規定馬路寬路六種。最寬三十公尺。最狹七公尺。與原有舊章。相輔而行。實於改良街道之中。兼寓整理路政之意。而爲發展新市之切要良圖也。</p>

<h3 id="e9">Condition After the Jinpu Battle <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Report of Inspection by Railway Department Commissioner</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Railways previously sent mechanical commissioner, Englishman Corder, engineering technician Xia Pindu, and mechanical technician Xia Lie to inspect the condition of the Jinpu Railway after the battle. After the members returned to the ministry, the general report was as follows: During the battle when our army retreated to the southern part of Yanzhou, in addition to dismantling some essential components of the Yellow River bridge near Jinan, there was no material damage to the tracks and buildings. When our army defeated the enemy army and its remnants retreated, they used every means to destroy buildings. Within the Yanzhou-Jinan section, a total of ten bridges were destroyed. From Yanzhou to Dawenkou, a distance of fifty kilometers, there were as many as seven destroyed bridges. The loss has already exceeded 130,000 yuan, and the total loss is still difficult to determine. After our army's victorious advance, the locomotive department of the railway immediately rushed to repair the damaged tracks. The Dawenkou Railway Bridge was also repaired on the 28th of last month. This project was greatly hindered by transportation due to military vehicles blocking the tracks. In addition, the first bridge, about one kilometer south of Dawenkou, was also damaged, so the progress of the project was further delayed. The reason why the through train between Puzhou and Jinan cannot be realized as soon as possible is that almost all locomotives and vehicles have been transferred for military use. The military authorities, because the road is indeed necessary to restore, has specially allocated some, and reduced the requisition supply, so as to have the opportunity to repair and improve the rate of force on time. Now the Pu-Ji section has resumed traffic, and Lanfu cars and heavy vehicles can travel as usual, but the shortage of freight cars is extreme, and the way to remedy it may not be easy to solve after a few weeks.

<h3 id="e11">The First Case of the League of Nations Administrative Council <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>The first case of the Administrative Council meeting convened by the League of Nations this time is the Palestine issue entrusted to the Reconciliation Committee. This shows the League of Nations' emphasis on the issue. According to the draft resolution read by the Finnish Foreign Minister, both the committee's report and the British response are taken into account. In fact, taking both sides into account means that there is no way to solve the problem and reconciliation is the only option. However, reconciliation is also very difficult. Since Palestine was separated from Turkey after the European War and became a British mandate, the Jews initially wanted to build a Jewish national state in Palestine alone. The Arabs strongly opposed it because it encroached on their rights. As a result, opinions diverged. Since the riots in Jerusalem in 1920, the two sides have been unable to cooperate administratively. Until last year, a major conflict broke out between the Hui and Jewish religions over the Wailing Wall. The sense of ill-will deepened, and there was no possibility of peaceful reconciliation. Britain cannot help either side, nor can it offend either side. The means of severe coercion are not dared to be used, and there is no way to implement appropriate solutions. Although there is an intention to encourage the Jews, it has still failed to reduce the dispute between the two sides. This is why the dispute has continued to this day. From another perspective, the hope of the Hui and Jewish people to break away from British mandate rule and gain independence is even more distant and impossible. Because Palestine is close to the Suez Canal and occupies an important area in terms of military and transportation. Since Britain has obtained this mandate, it will certainly not easily give it up. Therefore, the riots in Palestine, although not directed against Britain, Britain has no way to reconcile the dispute between Jews and Arabs, and has no way to satisfy the original wishes of Jews and Arabs. It is extremely difficult to abandon this and seek a proper solution. Does the Administrative Council have any fair way to resolve this long-standing issue? Important Domestic Telegrams II</p>

<p>The Northern Government Has No Legal Basis</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Chonghui, President of the Judicial Yuan, told a United Press reporter that Yan Xishan's assumption of the chairmanship of the Northern Government and the establishment of the Northern Government are personal actions with no legal basis and do not create a problem domestically. Their purpose is to confuse the vision and hearing of the powers. From the perspective of the powers, it seems inconvenient for two governments to appear in one country. However, since the central government has already been recognized first, the powers will certainly not be deceived by the northern government again. Therefore, regarding this issue, the central government does not need to issue a foreign declaration. The war can be resolved soon, and the northern warlords will inevitably fall soon. The central government is now doing its best to use military force to suppress the northern army in order to seek a final solution. (Ninth day Japan United Press telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the reorganization after the recovery of Weihaiwei, the Executive Yuan has drafted a plan to establish a naval port after the recovery and reported it to the National Government for record. Recently, it has been learned that the National Government has forwarded the case to the Central Political Council, which has been submitted to the Political Report Group and the Foreign Affairs Group for review. It is reported that the review results believe that there are two management methods after the recovery of Weihaiwei: (1) Establish a Weihaiwei Management Office, with one commissioner, appointed with Simplified Appointment. The organizational law should be drafted by the Executive Yuan. (2) Establish a customs office, not designated as a tax-free port. The above measures have been decided by the Central Political Council and have been replied to the National Government, instructing it to comply. (Ninth day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company decided to set up a Weihaiwei shipping line to facilitate postal transportation.

<p>Teachers' Union Fails to Borrow Money from the Bank</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today, the Teachers' Union sent seventy representatives to visit the Farmers' and Workers' Bank to discuss borrowing money, but to no avail. (Ninth day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Teachers' Union also sent a letter to the local authorities today, stating that the education fee is four months in arrears. After learning that the Farmers' and Workers' Bank has 1.27 million in education funds issued by the Ministry of Finance, the colleagues are out of food, so they borrowed from the bank, but the bank is irresponsible and it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no embezzlement and escape. Personnel should be sent to monitor the manager of the bank, and other words. It is generally expected here that the education fee problem will cause some waves. (Ninth day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the eighth, the Farmers' and Workers' Bank reported to the Garrison Department, the Security Department, and the Public Security Bureau, saying that there were more than fifty representatives of the Teachers' Union who came to the bank, claiming that the education fee was four months in arrears, and discussing borrowing huge sums of money. When contacting our General Manager, the representatives prepared a draft agreement for urging Principal Li to pay the money. If there is no concrete solution after seven days, the Shida (Normal University) housing will be used as collateral to borrow 400,000, and it is said that if the loan is not successful, the representatives will not be responsible for the direct action of the education sector. Our General Manager did not agree. For a while, tea bowls were thrown and force was about to be used. For this reason, it is reported for protection, and other words.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the Shanghai Concession telephone business is undertaken by the Sino-Foreign joint venture China-Foreign De-Law Telephone Company, and the Chinese shares actually account for 47 percent. However, the Chinese side mostly has scattered small shares, which are extremely loose. As a result, the company can pass the bidding method through a shareholders' meeting. Now the company has actually transferred. If the previous method of empty protests is still used, it will not help the matter. It is now planned to start from the actual aspect. The telephones installed in Nanshi, Pudong, and other places by the Concession Company will be ordered by the Ministry of Communications to the bureau to propose to the Concession Company to take them back in accordance with the Sino-Foreign connection contract, and to implement the takeover as soon as possible. As for the telephones in the areas where roads are built beyond the boundary, it is planned to handle them after the Shanghai West police power issue is resolved.

<p>Discussion of the Briand Plan</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 8th A meeting of cabinet members from 23 European countries was held at 3:00 p.m. today to discuss the issue of a European Federation. French Foreign Minister Briand strongly requested open discussions, but due to opposition from the majority, a closed-door meeting was held. The only thing made public was France's new memorandum, a total of 142 pages, which listed Briand's original memorandum and the responses from 26 countries, followed by France's conclusions. It stated that based on the responses from various countries, it is clear that they all recognize the importance of the material and spiritual unity of Europe and requested that all countries value international solidarity. Do not worry too much about the fact that there are still some points on which opinions differ. As of today, people here are speculating about the selection of members of the future review committee, believing that on the one hand, the representatives of all 27 European countries cannot be included, and on the other hand, representatives from outside Europe must be added. Countries such as Japan, Chile, Peru, New Zealand, and India are the most promising candidates.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 8th At today's informal meeting, representatives from 27 European countries attended and unanimously passed the motion of French Foreign Minister Briand to submit the European Federation plan to the League of Nations Assembly. British Foreign Secretary Henderson seconded the motion. The participants all believed that the joint work of European governments in various international undertakings is closely related to the maintenance of world peace. This joint work must be based on the principles of the League of Nations Charter and implemented with the full consent of the League of Nations. Briand may submit this case to the Assembly on Thursday. According to reports, after the United Kingdom received Briand's memorandum on the European Federation plan, it replied with a very sympathetic letter, but was concerned that this new organization might reduce the effectiveness and authority of the League of Nations and cause animosity and suspicion among the continents. Therefore, it advocated that the proposed articles be fully incorporated into the structure of the League of Nations, so that Briand's proposal could be consolidated. Based on this view, the United Kingdom suggested that Briand's memorandum be included on the agenda of the next League of Nations Assembly. On August 7th, the general opinion was that since the United Kingdom had made this request, the French Foreign Minister's memorandum must be discussed by the Assembly, and all parties also wanted to consider the sensitivity of the League of Nations. Reuters, Geneva, 8th The League of Nations Executive Council has decided to send a committee to investigate the trafficking of women and children in the East. Representatives from Japan and Persia both stated that their governments could support the committee's investigation.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 8th The 16th session of the League of Nations Executive Council opened here at 11:00 a.m. this morning, chaired by the Foreign Minister of Venezuela. The first item on the agenda was the Palestine report of the Mandates Commission. The Foreign Minister of Finland then read a lengthy draft resolution, the content of which took into account both the Commission's report and the United Kingdom's response. It generally stated that the riots in Palestine were not directed at the United Kingdom, and that the United Kingdom had done its best to make Palestine a Jewish homeland, while at the same time opening the way for self-government for the majority Arab population there.</p>

Today, it was replayed in the capital when Mr. Fei attended a civic meeting. After the meeting, when the public demonstrated against the new taxes, the police came out to stop them, resulting in a conflict. As a result, dozens of people were arrested and countless people were injured. As for the situation in Smyrna, shipyard workers have gone on strike, and the situation is becoming increasingly tense. The army has been mobilized to disperse the strikers' gatherings. The leaders of the ruling party, the People's Party, have notified party members not to hold demonstrations in support of the government to avoid opportunists taking the opportunity to cause trouble and at the same time declared that strict measures will be taken against rioters.</p>

<p>Argentine Governance Returns to Landowner Hands</p>
<p>Old Party Suddenly Rebels and Resists, Capital Placed Under Martial Law</p>
<p>Associated Press, Buenos Aires, 8th General Uribe Paul, who led the revolutionary army to overthrow the original government, was formally sworn in today as the interim president of Argentina. According to Uribe, he will immediately prepare for elections to elect a legal president to take charge of the political situation.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Capital of Argentina, 8th The interim government here today announced that it will restore the constitutional foundation in the shortest possible time and solemnly declared that although the country is now in a state of revolution, all international obligations will be strictly observed. It also stated that the deposed President Irigoyen is currently ill, but not suffering from paralysis, and is temporarily residing in La Plata. The authorities do not restrict his freedom.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th News from Buenos Aires states that Argentina is now ruled by an interim government, whose civilian personnel are all wealthy and conservative aristocrats. That is, governance has returned to the hands of the landowners, returning to the state before former President Irigoyen was elected.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 8th A message from the capital of Argentina states that gunshots were heard in the capital last night. It is believed that warships are attacking government offices. It is reported that the cavalry is now attacking the military academy.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th News from Buenos Aires states that last night near gun and artillery shells fell, injuring fifty people. The reason is unknown, and the authorities have not issued an explanation. At midnight, General Uribe Paul ordered the soldiers to quell the rebellion against the new government. Later reports said that a large fire broke out near the government offices, and some said that something was on fire, but it was later learned that the fire had been extinguished. However, heavy guards were placed in the city's four stations.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th The New York Times received a wireless telephone message from Buenos Aires stating that last night's unrest in Buenos Aires was caused by the former President Irigoyen's party, which launched an uprising in various parts of the city to resist the new government. At that time, fires broke out everywhere, as a sign of the uprising. At least twenty people were killed and more than two hundred were injured. The new government has ordered the re-arrest of former President Irigoyen and will immediately send him to the Buenos Aires Police Headquarters, and has ordered the arrest of Irigoyen's cabinet members and members of both houses of parliament during his administration, and the detention of the heads of the liberal Irigoyen-affiliated committees. The Minister of Interior has issued a communiqué stating that because civilians are now disturbing public order with weapons, anyone traveling with weapons will be subject to military law.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 9th How will the revolution in Argentina affect US-Argentine commercial relations and other relations? This is now the subject of speculation among the general public. In recent years, US-Argentine relations have not been very good. Argentina is now quite close to Britain, and the South American republics are now all inclined to trade with Britain, which is intolerable to the United States. The recent unrest in various Latin American countries is also causing anxiety among the American business community.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 8th The final volume of US war documents has recently been published. The book is titled (US Diplomatic Relations in 1918), and its final volume mainly describes the relationship between the United States and the Far East. In recent days, German newspapers have published lengthy commentaries on this, and because the book mentions a report from the US Minister to China on June 29 of that year, which states that the people in Shandong Province all prayed for the victory of the German army, German newspapers mostly called this a clear proof that the Chinese and German people have deep sympathy for each other.</p>

<p>First requested to be presented with the response document, but was rejected by the government. Next, it wanted the government to present the full power and correspondence documents between the Minister of Finance and Minister Kato, and hoped that former Military Affairs Minister Kato would attend, but all were rejected. And when the content of the supplementary plan was to be examined, a specific plan was requested, and it was rejected again. As a result, it is impossible to examine the extent to which the surplus of military reduction will reduce the national burden. The dissatisfaction of the Privy Council is therefore deepening. Some counselors believe that the Privy Council cannot blindly follow such an important treaty and advocate that it cannot be examined. The Secretary of the Privy Council visited Ito, the head of the Investigation Committee, at his private residence at 9:00 this morning to discuss this. At the moment, there is a difficult barrier to break through between the Privy Council and the government. Which side will the Privy Council and the government yield to, or can a solution be found that takes both sides into account? All parties are extremely concerned about this.</p>

<p>Discussion of the Relationship Between Rationalization and Unemployment</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th The economics section of the British Science Advancement Society met today. Chairman Professor Gregory discussed the relationship between rationalization and unemployment, saying that for the time being, rationalization is not a relief for unemployment, but creates industry. The real difficulty is that if rationalization is implemented, costs will be reduced and the market will recover, and purchasing power will be generated as a result. How will consumers use their remaining purchasing power? If consumers seek to satisfy their new desires, rationalization will ultimately not cause unemployment. According to his opinion, the endless development of productive forces has given society room to maneuver, and this room is the source from which unemployment can be reversed. He also said that the country with the highest standard of living is the country where the authorities employ the most people in the supply of luxury goods. All hopes must be based on the known elasticity and responsiveness of capitalist society. Any organization that can survive the shocks of the war and post-war period will not be destroyed, because it knows how to shift its production skills to better uses in the future, rather than those of the past century.</p>

Central Committee members Hu Hanmin, Dai Chuanxian, Chen Guofu, Wang Boqun, Zhu Peide, Shao Yuancong, Jiao Yitang, Li Wenfan, Chen Zhaoying, Chen Lifu, Enke Batu, Kexing'e, Miao Peicheng, Chen Yaoheng, etc., as well as representatives from the National Government and various Yuan-level departments, and staff members of the Central Government's various departments, totaling approximately six hundred people, attended. Chairman Hu Hanmin presided. After the ceremony, the chairman gave a report, stating that the Premier was born into a farming family, possessed great ambitions, and, seeing that farmers were too oppressed and lacked basic health knowledge, studied medicine to become a doctor. On the one hand, he used his philanthropic spirit to alleviate the suffering of the people from diseases, and on the other hand, he used his political vision to seek freedom, equality, and happiness for the nation. At that time, considering that the Chinese people were being invaded and dominated by imperialism, and oppressed and ravaged by the Manchu government, he believed that only by creating the Three Principles of the People could the nation be saved, and only by overthrowing the autocratic government could reform be achieved. Therefore, he resolved to initiate a national revolution. At that time, Chinese society was extremely corrupt and outdated, with very little support, and progress was extremely difficult. He persevered with a spirit of great fearlessness. In the autumn of thirty-six years ago, he ordered Deng Yin'nan, Lu Haodong, and others to seize Guangzhou as a base. He traveled back and forth between Hong Kong and Guangdong. Unexpectedly, on September 9th, over six hundred firearms being transported were seized by the Guangzhou Customs. Lu Haodong and Qiu Si Zhu Gui died at the same time. The Premier then went to Japan with Zheng Shiliang. This was the failure of the first uprising. However, although it failed, the Premier's revolutionary ideas were not diminished, and his revolutionary spirit was not weakened. Instead, they became even more passionate and surging, believing that failure is the mother of success. When the people of the country were in a deep slumber, without this failure, no one would have recognized the motive of the revolution, and foreigners would not have known that the Chinese nation still had a spirit of self-determination. Therefore, we must trace and deeply understand the Premier's main purpose of seeking reform through sacrifice and saving the country through doctrine. Next, Shao Yuancong gave a speech, saying that when the Premier first arrived in Guangzhou, he used his medical skills to gain the trust of all sectors of society and also established the Agricultural Society. At that time, the Qing government admired and valued him for his superior academic abilities and did not know his ulterior motives. After more than half a year of preparing for the revolution, the movement had matured, so it was planned to launch a large-scale attack on Guangzhou on September 9th. All arrangements were very meticulous. The proclamation to overthrow the Manchus and the declaration to foreign countries had been drafted. Most of the defense camps and naval forces in the city responded. The reason for setting the uprising on that day was that, according to Guangzhou customs, families swept tombs on September 9th, and pedestrians were crowded, so even if thousands of people entered the city, it would avoid the authorities' attention. However, due to a lack of secrecy, it was detected beforehand. On the day before the uprising, someone advised the Premier to postpone it. The Premier believed that the information had come too late, and he was afraid that if he lost credibility the first time, it would be difficult to call for action in the future. Therefore, he risked launching the uprising. Due to insufficient strength, it resulted in failure. Several comrades sacrificed. After the Premier and the uncaptured comrades escaped danger, he calmly went to Tangjiawan, passed through Macau, and returned to Hong Kong. However, the Premier's spirit was not diminished by this failure. His starting point was the Three Principles of the People, and he sought to fundamentally transform the country from beginning to end. Although he suffered countless hardships and difficulties, he continued to struggle, doing what others dared not do and what others could not do, in order to achieve ultimate success. Moreover, the Premier's lifelong goal was the success of the cause, regardless of who achieved it or when it was achieved. His spirit of sacrificing personal gains was unmatched. Next, Lin Baike gave a speech. The ceremony concluded at eleven o'clock.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Hunan Province Requests Reinforcements to Suppress Communists <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>A Changsha dispatch from September 7th reports that the communist bandits Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang invaded Changsha but were repelled on the 4th. However, the strength of the bandits has not yet been eliminated. There are still about 40,000 to 50,000 of them, gathering in the mountains bordering Changping, Liuyang, and Liling, in the areas of Zhongsigang, Yaomajian, Zhentoushi, Pujishi, and Gaoqiao, hoping to take the opportunity to counterattack. The Fourth Route Army and the two divisions of Gong Bingfan and Luo Lin, fearing a trick by the communists, are still holding the key fortresses in the suburbs of Changsha and have not pursued them deeply. Therefore, although the siege of Changsha has been lifted, it is still not entirely safe. He Jian telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Director He Yingqin, requesting reinforcements to Pingjiang and Liuyang, and ordering the Jiangxi army to quickly exit Pingxiang and Wanzai to encircle and suppress them. At the same time, the Hunan Rehabilitation Committee, the Provincial Education Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in view of the critical situation, in addition to telegraphing Commander-in-Chief Chiang, earnestly requesting He Yingqin to personally lead two divisions to Hunan to supervise the suppression, also appointed Shu Lijian and four others as representatives to go to Hankou and present their grievances to He Yingqin, appealing for help. The three telegrams requesting troops are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram 1 Urgent To Commander-in-Chief Jiang in Liuzhou, Gui Deyi, and Jinan; President Tan of the Nanjing Executive Yuan; President Hu of the Legislative Yuan; Chief of General Staff Zhu; Director He of the Hankou Headquarters; Chairman Lu in Nanchang: The bandits, after their defeat in Zhichu, Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, etc., reconvened in Dongshan and launched another counterattack. They also gave a speech to the bandit soldiers, saying that if they captured Changsha, their revolution would succeed; otherwise, it would fail. There would be no He Jian if there were them, and no them if there was He Jian. Therefore, yesterday, Wei Ri, although the Red Guards in the rear fled in droves, their strength is actually lurking in the mountains 40 to 50 li from the province, intending to lure us out and counterattack. After careful investigation, I immediately ordered a part of the chasing troops to secretly return to their positions. In the evening, the bandits returned and attacked in the Guitang area. After killing many bandits, they knew that we were heavily guarded and could not break through. They retreated again in the direction of Yuchou towards Zhuzhou, Liling, and Hunan. They are currently being searched and pursued. However, although the bandits have been severely beaten and suffered 5,000 to 6,000 casualties, their strength, excluding the Red Guards, still consists of 40,000 to 50,000 armed soldiers with spears, plus the remnants of the Gui faction, Tang Shengming and others, colluding to attack Hengbao. My troops are defending and suppressing simultaneously, and the force is thin. I propose to increase troops to go straight to Pingjiang and Liuyang, and order the Jiangxi army to quickly exit Pingxiang and Wanzai to cut off their retreat, so as to encircle and annihilate them. I, He Jian, respectfully present Yuyin.</p>
<p>Telegram 2 Urgent To Commander-in-Chief Jiang in Xuzhou: The communist bandits Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, Kong, Lin, etc., jointly attacked Changsha. The entire military force of the communist party is gathered in one corner. Our entire Fourth Route Army and the Gong and Luo divisions are firmly defending. From the evening of the last month to Zhiri of this month, continuous fierce attacks have been launched. Although relying on the bravery of the officers and soldiers, the positions have been maintained. However, with continuous attacks day and night, our army is outnumbered and in constant danger. Moreover, other bandits are disturbing various places, and the people are suffering greatly, eagerly hoping for rescue. I urgently request you to order Director He to quickly dispatch two or more elite divisions and two bombing aircraft, and to personally lead them to Hunan to supervise the suppression as soon as possible, so as to achieve the merit of gathering and annihilating them, and to resolve the urgent crisis. It is a matter of life and death, and a moment's delay is too late. I urgently present my words and await orders. Hunan Rehabilitation Committee kowtows Weiyin.</p>
<p>Telegram 3 Urgent To Director He of the Hankou Headquarters: The communist bandits Peng, Huang, Zhu, and Mao have jointly attacked Changsha. The circumstances of the joint suppression by our army, navy, and air force have been telegraphed to the Hunan Rehabilitation Committee. The members of our association have witnessed the fierceness and cunning of the bandits and considered the difficulty and danger of the situation. We propose that you urgently dispatch elite troops nearby and first send multiple aircraft to Hunan to supervise the suppression as soon as possible, so as to achieve a complete victory. We have specially sent Shu Lijian, Chen Jieshi, Fang Kegang, Ren Kainan representing the Education Association, and Wei Zhenbang representing the Changsha Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to your camp to present our case. We earnestly request you to be mindful of the crisis and quickly provide rescue. Hunan Rehabilitation Committee, Provincial Education Association, Changsha General Chamber of Commerce kowtows Weiyin.</p>
<p>As for the remnants of the Gui faction who invaded Hengbao, according to a telegram report from Duan Heng, commander of the Hunan Southern Garrison, they were defeated on the 6th. The original telegram is recorded as follows: (Urgent (1) The rebels Tang Shengming, Yan Renyi, Feng Tianzhu, etc., gathered 3,000 to 4,000 bandits with more than 1,000 rifles, 3 machine guns, 2 mortars, and countless spears, and attacked Hengzhou in two routes from Yuchou. They engaged in fierce battles with our Chen and Yu regiments on the Wulipai Gaoling line, killing 400 to 500 bandits, capturing countless weapons, ammunition, and supplies. The rebels have collapsed and are fleeing towards Quanhushi. Our army is pursuing them. (2) According to prisoners, the rebels intend to flee back to their old nest in Yongzhou Dong'an. (3) I urge you to order He Tuan to intercept them at Dayingshi to annihilate them. Duan Heng kowtows Yuwu.) It seems that the problem of the Gui faction's invasion of Hengbao may not be difficult to solve.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Communists in Hukou Have Been Repelled <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Jiujiang Communication: The communist bandits Fang Zhimin, Shao Shiping, etc., after being severely beaten by government troops in Raozhou, led 5,000 to 6,000 bandits on the 4th of this month and fled to the Jiangqiao area of Hukou, hoping to disrupt Xunhu. Zhang Chao, the battalion commander of the Special Service Battalion of the 18th Jiangxi Division and the commander of the 2nd Garrison Regiment, led more than 2,000 soldiers from Duchang to pursue and suppress them. Commander Tong of the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the Ministry of Finance's Anti-Smuggling Unit also led his troops to intercept them at 4:00 AM that day. When they arrived at Lantingling, they made contact with the bandits and immediately repelled them. They continued to pursue them to Jiangqiao, where they engaged in fierce fighting. They used machine guns and automatic rifles to fire fiercely, causing about 400 to 500 casualties on the bandit side. Wang Xinqu, the commander of the Command Headquarters of the Ministry of Finance's Anti-Smuggling Unit, arrived at 4:00 PM to inspect the defense area. Hearing that Commander Tong was in contact with the bandits, he went to the front to command. Commander Wang believed that the bandits were powerful and our army was outnumbered. Therefore, he telegraphed Chairman Lu, requesting him to quickly send a large army to pursue and suppress them. At the same time, he reorganized his troops, firmly defended the county seat, and deployed troops to guard all important places. After completing the deployment, he returned to Xunzhen at 5:00 PM on the 5th. In this battle, the bandits had 5,000 to 6,000 troops, and Wang's troops were less than two battalions. He managed to repel the bandits, allowing Hukou to be preserved. His fighting spirit is truly admirable. (September 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Russian Red Party Plans to Bomb the Songhua River Railway Bridge <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Binjiang Police Arrest Fourteen Members of the Russian Red Party Harbin Communication: On the afternoon of August 31st, Gao Qidong, the director of the Binjiang Public Security Bureau, received a confidential report stating that a group of Russian Communists were planning to disrupt the area along the river and planned to blow up the Songhua River Railway Bridge to create red terror. They hired a No. 37 sailing boat and falsely claimed to be going to Heihe. The bureau had heard of this news a week ago and had been paying attention to preventing it. After receiving the report, he immediately ordered his officers to arrest Li, the owner of the No. 37 sailing boat, from the eastern suburbs of Harbin. The director interrogated him, and he confessed that the Russians had hired the boat. There were about ten of them, all young men in their twenties. They claimed to be going to the lower reaches of the river to transport machinery and agricultural implements, but before sailing, they had to go to the Hengjiang Great Railway Bridge north of the river to pick up items. They stated that the boat fare was 100 yuan, and they paid 25 yuan in advance. Li insisted on paying half the amount in advance, so they had not yet reached an agreement. After Gao obtained the confession, he ordered the captain of the detective team, Gao Changsan, to investigate strictly. Gao sent detectives Zhang Minglun and Ma Jiuzhai to pose as boatmen and serve on the No. 37 sailing boat. At 6:00 PM on September 1st, a group of about seventeen Russians, each carrying luggage, arrived at the dock at Qidaojiekou and hailed a ferry. Detectives Zhang and Ma solicited business and tricked the group of Russians onto the No. 37 sailing boat. They immediately hoisted the sails and sailed out of the city. In the middle of the river, they pretended to have a broken rudder and stopped to repair it. At that time, the detective team and the security team had received reports separately and knew that the Russians had been caught. The captain of the security team, Jin, and the captain of the detective team, Gao, led dozens of detectives and police officers in a motorboat to pursue them. Guan Zhongxing, the director of the Water Police Bureau, also took a gunboat and led a large team of police officers to set out. At 6:30 PM, they approached the sailing boat and fired a warning shot, ordering the Russians to raise their hands. The Russians ignored them. Some of them took out grenades from their bags and tried to throw them at the police boat. Detectives Ma and Zhang drew their guns to stop them. The police team boarded the boat and tied up the Russians one by one. They searched them and found a long, cylindrical, highly explosive grenade on each of them. They were immediately escorted to the Binjiang Public Security Bureau. After being interrogated by Director Gao Qidong, their statements were inconsistent. Two of them claimed to be White Russians and were ordered by Zhang Zongchang to go to the Heihe area to do business. When asked what kind of business, they refused to answer. The case will be tried in court within days, but according to official proof, they are purely international communists who are plotting to disrupt North Manchuria. (1st)</p>

<p>Investigation into the Tragic Death of Tang Zhi Kui The owner of Tang Helong store, Tang Zhikui, was stabbed to death by a thief at two o'clock in the morning on the fifth, with fifteen large and small knife wounds. After the prosecutor arrived to inspect and filled out the corpse form, an order was issued to arrest the murderer. However, on the night of Tang Zhikui's tragic death, he stayed in the store. After the incident, a careful examination of the murderer's entry and exit routes showed only footprints going out, but no signs of entry. The front shop was obviously not accessible to outsiders, and the garden doors in the back were all locked. From the bedroom to the back door, there were more than a dozen doors, either bolted or locked, all of which were opened one by one, allowing the murderer to escape calmly in the darkness. Therefore, these various doubts have aroused speculation in society. The family has submitted a petition to the County Court Prosecutor's Office, offering a reward for the arrest of the murderer. Today (the 9th), the Prosecutor's Office issued summons to Tang Cai, the widow of the deceased, his son Qiu Sheng, his nephew Jingren (who served as the store's accountant), and Ye Diku, a student who shared a room with him, to investigate everything in order to arrest the murderer. Military Department Sends Committee to Investigate Military Property The Military Administration Department has sent Zhang Mingda and several other investigators from the Construction Division of the Military Supply Department to Songjiang to organize an office at Xiaobei Temple as members of the Second District Investigation Area for the Clearance of Military Property in Jiangsu Province, and will be responsible for investigating military property in this county. The office has now begun operations and has recently consulted the county government, stating that according to Article 14, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on the Management of Military Property, anyone who encroaches upon, steals, sells, conceals, or illegally obtains military property, or forges licenses, will be severely punished in addition to the recovery of the military property. However, those who confess before being discovered will be exempt from punishment, except for the recovery of the military property. County Magistrate Jin has issued orders to his subordinates to inform them accordingly.</p>
<p>Oil Mill Owner Receives Threatening Letters Repeatedly The owner of the Shen oil mill in Yanjiawan in the county received threatening letters in the spring, demanding 500 yuan. The other day, he received another letter from bandits demanding 1,300 yuan, with a date to meet in Shanghai. At the time, the owner's younger brother went to Shanghai for business and stayed at the Jiuhua Hotel. As soon as he unpacked his luggage, another letter from the bandits arrived, with even more激烈的措词。 The Garrison Department Sends Troops to Take Over Defense This city has always been guarded by a special regiment from the Anti-Smuggling Bureau. Now, due to successive transfers, the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters has transferred the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Supplementary Regiment of the 5th Division to Songjiang to take over the defense. They arrived in Songjiang today.</p>

<p>Trial Scheduled for Reactionary Case: Two reporters from a certain newspaper in Changshu, Gui Han and Shen Xuexia, were accused by the county party headquarters of having counter-revolutionary suspicions. They were transferred to the High Court by the County Public Security Bureau. The High Court held a hearing a few days ago, but it was postponed to the afternoon of the 19th of this month because the plaintiff, the county party committee, failed to appear after being summoned.</p>
<p>Large Number of Suspected Reactionaries Arrested: The Public Security Bureau arrested Song Qin, a counter-revolutionary suspect, in the early morning of the day before yesterday at Vinegar Workshop Bridge. Song confessed that many people were involved. Yesterday (the 9th), the Public Security Bureau dispatched a motorcycle team led by Officer Wang and others and arrested 14 suspects including Kong Shaoxi, Wu Jinli, Wang Yutian, Hu Zhiji, Wang Zhangxian, Gu Chaoyan, Song Yucheng, Li Hongfu, Chen Ping, Pan Agen, Dai Amao, Pan Afu, Zhou Akun, and Pan Qingbao in the Pingjiang Road area. They were immediately taken to the bureau for investigation. The Lixing Steamboat on the Shenhu Route Robbed: The Lixing steamboat, which travels between Shanghai and Huzhou, set off from Shanghai at about 2:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 8th). When it was passing the Yuhui Xiehutang area near Jiashan, it was suddenly ambushed by a large gang of pirate ships, about twenty or more, with about two hundred or more pirates. They stopped the Lixing steamboat and swarmed aboard to search and plunder, which lasted about two hours. They robbed nine pieces of fragrant floral cloth shipped on behalf of customers, as well as foreign groceries and fruits, and countless clothes and ornaments from passengers, with an estimated loss of about two to three thousand yuan. After the pirates had their fill, the accountant of the boat, Tang Changsheng, ordered the driver to sail to Pingwang and report to Lu Shangzhong, the captain of the 15th Suzhou Water Police Team, and handed over seven rows of box cannon shells left by the pirates on the boat, requesting that a team be sent to pursue them.</p>

<p>The Police Team's Investigation of the Reactionary Case: The county police team has investigated the reactionary activities of various squad leaders and police officers. We have already reported on this in our newspaper. Now we have learned that this matter started when Meng Jiluo, who once served as the squad leader of the first squad, was entrusted by a certain northern warlord to come to Fengxian to campaign and to issue appointment certificates indiscriminately to recruit people widely, with Zhou Bingrong, the deputy squad leader of the general headquarters, as the leader to take charge of the liaison. As a result, many squads were incited by him. However, the actions of these people were inevitably strange on weekdays, so acting team leader Tu had already paid attention to them. Last Wednesday, the general headquarters accidentally found a letter from Pan Jisheng, who claimed to be a brigade commander, sent from Shanghai to Zhou Bingrong. The content stated that "Our army has been established and now has 8,000 rifles and hundreds of box cannons. We will set off soon, but the army commander is in Tianjin on official business, so I hope that all brothers will not be impatient," At the same time, Yang Xingsheng, the second squad leader stationed in Zhuang, also secretly reported to the team that Pan Adong had secretly come to plot rebellion. Acting team leader Tu was handling the matter together when suddenly Chen Shu, the squad leader of the general headquarters, reported that the reactionary liaison Meng Jiluo had arrived in the south. So he immediately acted without a sound and arrested him at a certain tavern on South Street and sent him directly to the County Public Security Bureau. He and Director Li Zhibin secretly interrogated him, and he directly admitted that he had come to Fengxian to campaign and had appointed someone as the fake commander of the regiment, battalion, and company, and on the spot, they found in his possession an order from the fake brigade commander Pan Jisheng, ordering the fake commander Zhou Bingrong to start an uprising from that day on. After the interrogation, Tu and Li were afraid that the news would leak out, so they immediately sent trusted soldiers overnight to the residence of the fourth squad to arrest all the confessed criminals. A total of seven people, including squad leaders Mao Rongfa and Zhao Desheng, were arrested one after another and were transferred to the Shanghai Songhu Garrison Command for handling today (the 8th) by the county with official documents.</p>

<p>County Party Headquarters Orders the Sealing of Newspaper Offices: The County Party Headquarters Rectification Committee recently submitted a request to the Provincial Party Committee, stating that the Jiangyin Minsheng and Shangbao newspapers had both violated Articles 8 and 9 of the Guiding Principles for News Reporting. The 61st meeting of the Provincial Rectification Committee had decided to close them down. The County Rectification Committee sent a letter to the county government, ordering the Public Security Bureau to execute the order on the 8th. (Note: Minsheng had already ceased publication on the 3rd due to economic reasons, but Shangbao had not stopped publishing.) On the morning of the 9th, Qi Jiewen, the main editor of Shangbao, Zhu Shuping, a staff member (assistant of the First District Office), Jiewen's younger brother Songwen, the head of the First District, and Meng Linyun, a servant, were all arrested.</p>
<p>Detention of Former Director Dai to Calculate Representative Accounts: Dai Yuandu, the former director of the Finance Bureau, sent his brother Dai Jing to Cheng to calculate the accounts of the handover. At 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, he convened a meeting of representatives from various bureaus to calculate local expenses. At that time, it was found that the Finance Bureau had collected 7,500 yuan in interest from various banks and shops last year, which was handed over to the County Local Assets Department. It was not stated which agency issued the loan note, nor was it stated what the money was used for. Later, at the end of the year, the Finance Bureau allocated more than 400 yuan from the education item and more than 3,000 yuan of additional taxes from the construction item, together with the local additional taxes, and returned them to the banks and shops. This was not in compliance with the procedures, so the calculation did not yield results. The representatives of the Education and Construction Bureaus immediately appealed to County Magistrate Li, who ordered the Public Security Bureau to detain Dai Jing temporarily.</p>
<p>Two Grandsons of the Xie Family Kidnapped: Xie Fulin and Xie Rulin, rent collectors of Miao Fuyan in Shengang Township, who lived in Shunbei Township, were kidnapped by several bandits the night before last.

<p>筹设皋桥大电厂</p>
<p>Planning the Establishment of the Gaoqiao Power Plant: The National Government Construction Commission, in order to develop the electricity industry, convened responsible personnel from various directly-administered power plants in Beijing a month ago for a meeting. It was decided to build a large power plant in both Jiangbei and Jiangnan. The large power plant in Jiangbei was decided to be located on the shore of Hongze Lake, and the large power plant in Jiangnan was decided to be centered in Wuxi, gradually expanding to neighboring counties. Recently, the commission specially sent technician Wu to Wuxi to survey the area. As a result of the survey, it was found that the area near Gaoqiao was the most suitable for building a plant. Technician Wu reported the results of the survey to the Construction Commission, and then Bao Guobao, the director of the electrical department of the commission, came to Wuxi for a re-survey, which was also considered satisfactory. Currently, specific plans for the construction of the plant are being properly drafted, and it is planned to purchase land and invite bids for the construction of the plant within the year. When the Gaoqiao power plant is established in the future, the electricity price will be low, so that all factories can use electricity as power, so that the entire county of Wuxi can be industrialized and electrified. It is also heard that in order to facilitate the transportation of coal for the power plant, Director Bao has reported to the Construction Commission and consulted the Ministry of Railways, ordering the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau to set up the planned small station between Wuxi and Shitangwan in Gaoqiao to facilitate transportation. Otherwise, a branch road will be added to Meijing (about three or four li from Gaoqiao) to directly reach Gaoqiao from Meijing.</p>
<p>The Rampancy of Bandits Is Worrying: In recent months, robbery cases have occurred frequently in the townships of this county, and few have been solved, so the atmosphere of banditry is becoming increasingly rampant. The day before yesterday at midnight, the home of Meng Bangjie, a resident of Yantai Township in the Sixth District, was suddenly broken into by more than a dozen bandits with guns. They entered the house and carried out a robbery, tying up all the members of the Meng family and searching for two hours before firing two shots into the air as a warning and leaving. In this incident, clothing and other items worth about 600 yuan were robbed. The Deadline for Resolving the Fraud and Breach of Trust Case: Liu Hanzhang, the owner of Fulongxing Leather Shoe Store at the entrance of the Shuyuan Alley in the city of this county, and his son Xikang, purchased firearms on behalf of Bian Shang and others, the heads of the Weihu Tuan in Qingyang, Qixia, and Yunting townships of Jiangyin, in June of the 17th year of the Republic of China, totaling 4,200 yuan, but the firearms were never delivered. Bian immediately negotiated with the Liu family, and Liu, knowing that he was at fault, used more than 70 mu of fake land in Suzhou as collateral, with Liu providing a full guarantee. In the spring of the 18th year, because Liu ignored it, Bian filed a complaint with the Wuxi County Government about the facts of fraud, breach of trust, and forgery of official seals. More than a year has passed without any results, which shows the difficulty of litigation. Yesterday, the trial was held by the judge Yu, who ordered the Liu family to settle the matter outside of court, setting a deadline of half a month. If the matter could not be settled, a judgment would be made according to law. The Liu family obeyed the order and withdrew. It is also heard that the people of the three townships of Yangqing are also concerned that the bandit forces in their townships have recently revived and urgently need firearms to be used. If the case is further delayed, they will jointly file a complaint with the central government and the provincial government.</p>
<p>Reactionary Elements Arrested in Xicang Town: Wang Wenzao, the leader of the second squad of the second company of the police force stationed in the twelfth district (Taibo City, Xicang Town), received a secret report from a citizen the day before yesterday, stating that reactionary elements were hiding in a certain small teahouse in the town, holding secret meetings in the fields every night and posting reactionary slogans, plotting wrongdoing. After receiving the report, Squad Leader Wang immediately led his team to search the address and arrested two reactionary elements, Wang Rengen and Chu Guijin, on the spot, and seized a bundle of reactionary slogans. He immediately led the team to interrogate them and escorted them to the city yesterday to be taken to the brigade headquarters, where Brigade Commander Wang held a preliminary trial. The confessions of the two criminals were extremely cunning, so they immediately prepared a document to transfer them to the county government to await interrogation.</p>

<p>Counter-suit in the Yanghuo Road Incident: On the Yanghuo Road in this county, a disturbance occurred previously due to road workers, who assaulted officials and destroyed the houses of various section chiefs. The house of Dong Shushen, the section chief of the sixteenth section, was also among those destroyed. However, Dong believed that Zhai Yueting and eight others were the instigators and filed separate complaints with the Construction Department and the county government. The county government repeatedly ordered the police team and the second and fourth public security bureaus in charge to strictly arrest them. It is heard that six people, including Xie Zhengfu, have been arrested one after another and handed over to the court for punishment. Dong also believed that the criminals had not been fully arrested and accused Officer Dai of the fourth public security bureau of accepting bribes. The general bureau assigned Inspector Liao Qiang to investigate thoroughly, but there was no evidence of bribery. Dong then accused Liao of also taking bribes. The general bureau has now assigned Inspector Gong to investigate again. At that time, they received an instruction from the Construction Department, stating that Tang Wansan and others, representatives of the thirty-six villages in Hangjiaji, presented that Dong Shushen was a rogue who falsely accused Zhai and the other nine people. Moreover, Dong had collected hundreds of yuan in construction funds on behalf of the workers but had not handed them over to the public, and Dong had issued private receipts as evidence. The Yanghuo Road incident was within the scope of the fifteenth section and had nothing to do with the sixteenth section. They requested that Dong be severely punished for violating the law himself and falsely accusing good citizens. It is hoped that the matter will be investigated and reported back.</p>

Recently, as autumn was approaching, she was building a new boat and had prepared 30 foreign dollars to go to the city to buy bamboo for weaving. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the day before yesterday, three big men quietly boarded Chen's boat, intending to rob her of her money. Chen, seeing this, knew that things were not good and shouted for help. The bandits robbed the foreign dollars and fled ashore. The villagers, hearing the alarm, rushed to chase after them. At the Xiaotang in front, the bandits tried to wade across the water but were caught by the villagers. When the bandits fled, they pushed Chen into the river because they saw her shouting wildly, but fortunately, she was rescued by someone. The three bandits were sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. All three denied that they were thieves, so the plaintiff and defendants were transferred to the city for further investigation.</p>

<p>The clerical and other courses offered by the Vocational Training School of the China Vocational Education Society are in urgent demand from all sectors, and those coming to the school to study are exceptionally enthusiastic. Yesterday was the date of the first examination, with over 30 candidates. The directors of the society, Mr. Jiang and Mr. Yang, personally conducted the oral examination and used the "Clerical Rules" compiled by Dr. Shen Youqian and Mr. Zheng Wenhan for separate verification tests. As a result, 13 people, including Ms. Cheng Manyin, were formally admitted to the clerical course, with four to the English course and three alternates. The second round of recruitment is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. on the 14th of this month, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Football Season Arrives <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Chinese football teams joining Westerners' associations must be negotiated through the Chinese Physical Education Advancement Association. Chinese football league games will be brought forward. After the Shanghai Westerners' Football Association began registration for this session, several Chinese football teams went to register. The association, because it had not obtained proof from the relevant Shanghai local Chinese sports authorities, was inconvenient to immediately approve, and sent a special letter to the Chinese National Physical Education Association, roughly stating (Chinese football teams joining the Westerners' Association must be certified and recommended by the Advancement Association before they can register, to clarify the boundaries of football jurisdiction), etc. Therefore, the Advancement Association has specially published this news in the newspaper as a public announcement. Football teams wishing to join the Westerners' Association should submit the team name, organization, and affiliated groups in detail to the Chinese National Physical Education Advancement Association on Labor Father Road within the next few days, so that they can negotiate with the Westerners' Association, it is said.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Chinese Football Federation had more than 50 member teams in the last session, with fierce competition and progress in the football skills of each team, which was greatly different from the past. Unfortunately, the competition was suspended for a long time due to the influence of the weather. Some school teams therefore failed to finish the competition. This session plans to advance the start time of the association's competition. Letters have now been sent to all old members to solicit opinions on joining. Because the competition venues are insufficient, the recruitment of new members will depend on the number of old members, it is said.</p>

<p>Since the promotion of table tennis in 1918, the skills have been improving day by day. Our country has already occupied a considerable position in the world. In recent years, the world has gradually paid attention to this sport. More than ten teams have been established one after another, but without a unified organization, they cannot progress consistently, making it difficult to achieve the purpose of table tennis, and to abolish improper indoor entertainment. Now, Lin Muzhao and Lin Murong of the Guangdong Women's Table Tennis Team, Li Ruifen and Zhang Runzhu of Liangjiang, and Guo Guangji and Chen Jinju of Patriotic intend to widely recruit like-minded people to organize the Shanghai Women's Table Tennis Federation. Before the establishment, Mr. Yu Binqi, the main organizer of the National Table Tennis Federation, will be in charge of all preparations. Any women's table tennis groups wishing to join the joint organization can send a letter to Mr. Yu at Xinli, 6 Jiujiang Road, it is said.</p>

<p>丨Lost the first game 1-2 to the Singapore League, Won the second game 3-2丨</p>
<p>(Singapore Dispatch, August 27) The Hong Kong Chinese Football Team came south to try its voice, and met its strong opponent, the Singapore League. In the first battle on August 25, the tiger fell in Pingyang and was bullied by dogs, losing 1-2 to the Singapore League. The second meeting on the 26th, the Singapore League drooped its head and retreated three houses, and was defeated by the Chinese 3-2. The wins and losses are equal. The Chinese team and the Singapore League can be said to be a pair of difficult brothers. The two battles are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e103">(1) The Chinese Team Tries the Singapore League for the First Time <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Result: Lost 1-2</p>
<p>The 24th was the day when the Hong Kong Chinese Football Team came south to try its voice for the first time. The team's (tiger) nickname has long been shocking. The people of the South are looking forward to the (tiger)'s stunts. However, the other side, the Singapore League, its players are all contemporary talents. The Singapore League has Ya Jiu (Chinese) in the back defense (one man guards the gate), and Malaysia's God of Feet and God of Head in the front. The Chinese expedition football team encountered them last time, and also painfully lost three goals. Its power can be seen from this. Now that the Chinese team has just raised its flag, it has met this strong enemy. Therefore, the people who are looking forward to the Tiger Gate are especially lively. Around the stadium, there is almost no place to stand. After 2:00 p.m. yesterday, it rained for a long time. Those who care about this battle were all discouraged. Fortunately, it cleared up immediately, and the sunshine shone. The spectators who kept coming on the road before the game all rejoiced, hurrying and bustling, for fear of being late. When the fierce battle was on, it rained again. Most of the spectators stood in the open air, and their clothes and shoes were all wet. Some used paper as umbrellas to avoid the rain temporarily. The athletes' performance in the rain was even more deeply imprinted in our minds. The reporter drove to the venue at 4:10 p.m., but saw several members of the Tiger team in Anshun Law, with a tide of people rising and falling, and the field was full of murderous atmosphere. When approaching the venue gate, he caught a glimpse of several members of the Tiger team riding in Mr. Hu Wenhu's Tiger car, with flags flying on the car, which was extremely spectacular. After arriving, he met Mr. Ye Jiugao, the leader of the Chinese team, and inquired that Mr. Cao Guicheng could not attend due to illness, and Li Hongqing replaced him. Mr. Chen Guangyao arrived as scheduled. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Team</p>
<p>Chen Guangyao</p>
<p>Li Yuda A Zuoxian Sun Jinshun</p>
<p>Chen Xipei Huang Ruihua Huang Bosong</p>
<p>Liang Yutang Li Guizhao He Jiaqiang</p>
<p>Li Hongqing</p>
<p>Singapore League Team</p>
<p>Ya Jiu (Chinese) Yu Shu (Chinese) Ding Niushi (Jiang)</p>
<p>Rui Lao (English) Min Hong (Chinese)</p>
<p>Luo Huada (Malay)</p>
<p>Nu Li De (English) Du La (Malay)</p>
<p>Mo Nu (Malay)</p>
<p>Ya Yao (Chinese) Kun An (Chinese)</p>
<p>The situation is very critical At 4:50, the Chinese athletes, led by captain Li Yuda, rushed out of the crowd. The team members wore yellow shirts, black sleeves, and white pants, running into the field. At first glance, they looked like a group of yellow-spotted tigers. The audience quickly applauded. Then the Singapore League team followed, wearing blue shirts and white pants, full of energy. The notary, Mr. Hua Weilu, then summoned the representatives of the two teams to determine the venue. Then the athletes of the two teams gathered to take pictures. The photographers were very active. After the photos were taken, the Chinese team shouted slogans, and the momentum was strengthened. The battle period had arrived, and the killing opportunity was opened. At this time, the weather was clear after the rain, the scenery was washed, and a rainbow curved in the middle of the sky, colorful and beautiful. Not five minutes after the start, the Chinese forward led the ball straight up, and with one kick, the ball went to the goal, and the situation was very critical. Fortunately, Ya Jiu calmly waved his hand, and the ball went away like an arrow. Before long, drizzle floated, and the open-air audience was discouraged.</p>
<p>Did Not Hit The Target Afterwards, the Malay forward of the Singapore League doubled his efforts. Kun An and Min Hong worked together to the best of their ability. The ball was mostly in front of the Chinese goal, and there were two dangers, which were rescued by Chen Xipei. The performance of the two athletes was excellent, and the audience was overjoyed. When the first half was about to end, the Chinese team was penalized with a free kick, which was kicked by Duan Lao. The ball was blocked by a Chinese team member as soon as it was kicked. It did not hit the target. Suddenly, the notary's silver horn sounded, ending the first half without a winner.</p>
<p>Reorganize the Flagship After the five-minute lemon time passed, the two teams changed venues, and the war machine started again. The ball hovered in front of the Chinese goal, and Tuo La and Luo Huada often dribbled the ball straight up. Mo Nao intercepted it, and was about to shoot directly at the goal when the silver horn suddenly sounded. Although the ball penetrated the Chinese goal, it was too late. It was a pity to kick in the air. When the battle reached 5:50, the ball was passed from the Chinese midfielder to the forward Sun Jinshun, who raised his foot and shot. Ya Jiu saw that the ball was in danger and had already deployed a defense. When the ball came, he gently caught it and kicked it away with his foot, turning danger into safety. The two sides fought for about 50 minutes, and they had not yet won or lost. The audience thought that the Chinese team was so brave, and that the battle that day would probably not be won or lost.</p>
<p>Like Losing the Pot Unexpectedly, at 52 minutes, Min Hong of the Singapore League dribbled the ball into the enemy's formation and passed it to Luo Huada. After Luo got the ball, he shot at the enemy's goal, and it went into the net as if he had lost the pot. The Chinese team lost the first goal. When the battle reached 6:00, Huang Bosong got the ball and was pushed out of bounds by Yu Shu. However, Yu Shu was penalized for this foul, and was penalized with a twelve-yard ball, which was stepped on by Sun Jinshun. At this time, Ya Jiu was alone in guarding the empty goal, lonely. Sun chose the price tag and stepped on it. The ball became incurable. The sound of firecrackers rose sharply, celebrating the Chinese team's recovery of a goal. The cheers of the audience resounded far and wide. The Chinese team's popularity is so great.</p>
<p>Two to One At this time, it was already a tie with one to one, and there were only five minutes left. If the Chinese team persisted, both sides would kiss the god of peace. However, things in the world are not necessarily satisfactory. Two minutes before the end, the Chinese team was again attacked by Tuo La of the Singapore League, making it two to one. Although the Chinese team wanted to counterattack, time did not wait for me. At 6:10, a long whistle sounded, and the audience swarmed up, arousing the war, which came to an end. So two to one, the Chinese team announced its defeat.</p>
<p>The performance is very good Watching the battle, the performance of the Chinese team members was very good. Its strength seems to be above the expedition team. Unfortunately, Cao (Xingcheng) and Wu (Jinquan) were ill and could not be on the field. The forward lacked a flying general, which was inevitably a bit weak. Sun Jinshun also seemed to be like Li Huitang's battle, and did not like to chase and win the ball, so it was difficult to win yesterday. If it were not for a twelve-yard ball, then the Chinese team would have suffered the same bad luck as the expedition team. Fortunately, the internal guard is strong, especially Liang Yutang is pleasing to the eye, and is highly praised by the audience. Even without Wu Jinquan, his strength is not weakened.</p>
<h3 id="e104">(2) Won the Singapore League Again <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Result: Three to Two</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Chinese Football Team made its second expedition on the 27th. The opponent was originally the Western League, but due to other reasons, it was changed to the Singapore League, so its lineup has changed slightly. Wanren, the leader of the Chinese team, has also joined the battle. The Chinese team, however, because Chen Cao has gone to Medan, the left and right wings have to be replaced by Mai and Li. Center forward Huang Bosong was injured in the waist in the previous battle and has not yet recovered, so he was unable to play. Therefore, the center forward who responded to the battle yesterday has been changed to He Jiaqiang, and He's internal auxiliary position has been filled by Liang Rongda. Yesterday, after the formation was set, a group of Chinese spectators were very worried about the Chinese team, thinking that Chen Cao's departure was like breaking an arm, and now with Huang's absence, the situation would be weaker than the previous forward. However, the result was the opposite. Yesterday's performance was not only better than before, but also defeated the Singapore League by three to two, recovering the lost reputation.</p>
<p>Deadlocked When the war started, the ball flew back and forth, and the direction was uncertain. People also ran back and forth, and both offense and defense were strong. The two armies were deadlocked and refused to give in to each other. The Chinese team lost many opportunities due to the weakness of the left wing. They could not intercept the ball, and their attacks were not accurate. As a result, several balls in front of the goal were lost in an instant. After sighing, people remembered Cao and Chen, thinking that if there were flying generals and train heads, there would not be such a loss. Wanren, who was expected by thousands of people to be able to do so, was slightly slow in action due to his large body, but his dribbling and fighting for the ball still had unique advantages that no one could match.</p>
<p>The Pillar of a Team He Jiaqiang deserves to be the pillar of a team. In the battle that day, his performance was particularly good. Of the three goals won by the Chinese team, in addition to one goal because the Singapore League's goal was in danger, the goalkeeper was unable to save the ball when he fell to the ground, and the defender hurriedly stepped the ball into his own net with one foot, the rest were all scored by He. The first goal was kicked in in the tenth minute of the first half, and the second goal was passed from the right wing to the front of the goal in the fiftieth minute of the second half, and was headed in by He Jiaqiang. His posture when heading the ball was like a wild child turning over, which was especially applauded by the audience. However, in addition to scoring three goals, the Chinese team had no room for further progress.</p>
<p>Good Liaison The Singapore League, on the other hand, fought hard from beginning to end. Its forward's charge into the battle was unusually brave. Dribbling and intercepting the ball were beyond the reach of the Chinese team, and the liaison was particularly good. Therefore, although the first half ended with a score of zero to one, the second half was still able to tie with two to two. If it were not for the self-inflicted mistake of defender Wilson, it would not have been declared a defeat.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Reactions to the Increased Water Rates <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Opinion of the Municipal Authorities</p>
<p>The Shanghai Waterworks Company of the Public Concession, citing the increased price of bids and the increased costs, which made it impossible to pay dividends to shareholders, reported to the Public Works Department for approval to increase water rates by 25 percent. Since the publication of this news in various newspapers, it has aroused a reaction from the general residents of the concession. Recently, the Fourth District Party Department of this city believes that tap water is one of the public utilities, and the livelihood of the entire people should be considered, and it should not be solely for the purpose of profit. The company previously increased the water rate standard from 10 percent to 22 percent, and the burden on the citizens has already felt too heavy. The rent of houses has increased this year, and the company's income has also increased invisibly. Even if it is affected by the high price of gold and low price of silver, how can it not save expenses to make up for the deficit? Why should it only exploit the people's livelihood and increase water rates again? It was submitted by the Municipal Executive Committee and transferred to the Municipal Government for negotiation and prohibition. The Municipal Government then sent it to the Public Utilities Bureau for verification. It is heard that the Bureau believes that the business of the Shanghai Waterworks Company is entirely in the concession. The places where water is supplied across the border are now being negotiated for recovery in order to reduce water prices and make them consistent with those in Shanghai South and Zhabei. Fortunately, although water prices in the concession have increased, water prices in the Chinese area remain the same, which is cheaper than the concession. The difference is even greater now. Citizens of the concession can move to the Chinese area, enjoy cheap water, and revitalize the Chinese area. Therefore, the Municipal Party Department is requested to actively advocate and persuade them, and at the same time send letters to Yuan Ludeng and Yu Qiaqing, who are Chinese directors of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, to quickly find ways to provide relief and alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>
<p>Real Estate Association</p>
<h3 id="e110">Protest Against Increased Water Rates <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Increasing Water Rates Due to Sharp Drop in Exchange Rate... Why Didn't They Reduce Prices Before? The Company's Largest Expenditure is Raw Materials... The Yangtze River's Flow of the Huangpu River</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association yesterday submitted a serious letter of protest to the Shanghai Waterworks Company. The full text is translated as follows: This is a formal protest against the increase of the tap water surcharge by 25 percent, which will be collected during the appropriate period. The Association believes that the statement issued by your company on August 6 in various newspapers, explaining the reasons for the increase of the tap water surcharge and the process, is unreasonable. Increasing water prices is not allowed in principle, and it should not be regarded as a temporary expedient. If it is implemented, it will violate the contract signed by the Public Works Department and your company on March 17, 1928. Please explain as follows: Although tap water is one of the public utilities, it cannot be equated with other public utilities, because tap water is not only a natural monopoly enterprise, but the product it supplies is absolutely indispensable to human life. Municipal experts even advocate that tap water must be absolutely undertaken by the public sector, because it is not only because tap water has a close relationship with public health, which can affect the rate of death and disease in a city, but also because private operators are afraid that they will seek profits and damage public interests. Therefore, tap water companies are different from private enterprises. Private enterprises seek high profits for shareholders, while tap water companies must create happiness for society. Their service policy and business policy should be based on social welfare everywhere. If they only seek profit for shareholders and do not hesitate to sacrifice social welfare, it is contrary to the principles of operating public utilities. The proposal of your company to increase the surcharge this time has damaged the interests of the entire society and individual users, which is by no means insignificant. Therefore, it has to be regarded as an unreasonable act, which is difficult for the entire citizens to accept. Although the Public Works Department has approved it, the approval of the public precedes the approval of the authorities. Secondly, the reason why your company proposes to increase prices is that the exchange rate has plummeted, prices have soared, and this year's net profit has therefore suffered losses, and the annual dividends are insufficient to pay. Before, when the exchange rate was high, we have never heard of your company's proposal to reduce prices, and the citizens have not benefited from it. Therefore, the losses caused by the sharp drop in the exchange rate cannot be compensated from the citizens. Moreover, tap water charges have followed the house prices for a long time. At present, due to land prices and construction relations, the price of houses has been more than ten to fifteen times higher compared with 20 years ago, and the water charges have also increased, which is quite alarming. Your company's economic foundation should be very stable. The guarantee money accumulated under the two items of (average dividend) and (revision of price) should be enough to pay this year's dividend, and it must be to increase the water price in order to make up for the deficit. Your company has increased the price by 20 percent in the past three years, and now it is collecting a surcharge of 25 percent, and it is said that it will have to increase it next year, which is really incomprehensible to the Association. As for the rising prices, the largest item in a company's expenditure should be raw materials. The raw material of your company is the continuous flow of the Huangpu River. If it is said that the cost of engineering has increased, the cost of laying water pipes should be a large item in the engineering expenditure. In fact, the water pipes in the houses everywhere are installed by the owners, and the cost of connecting to the main water pipe is still borne by the owners, from 60 taels of silver for a quarter of an inch pipe to 175 taels of silver for a four-inch pipe. Therefore, the cost of engineering for your company is actually borne by the owners for a part of it. Judging from the source of raw materials and the cost of engineering, the so-called rising prices are not enough to be a reason for increasing the surcharge. Finally, there is one more thing to say, that your company's increase in water prices violates the contract of March 17, 1928, because the contract stipulates a price, and the price cannot be changed during the effective period of the price rate. If it is said that the increase of the surcharge is to reduce the increase of the price rate next year, whether the increase next year is possible and whether it can be implemented still depends on the social assessment and approval. How can it be used as a reason for the current increase of the surcharge? Moreover, the Public Works Department once said that if the exchange rate returns to two shillings, this issue will be reconsidered. At the moment, the exchange rate has gradually increased, and the so-called increase next year may be only possible. This Association is composed of the Shanghai real estate industry. The submission of this protest is not only on behalf of the will of the members of this Association, but also on behalf of the public opinion of all residents, because the residents are deeply affected by the increase in water prices, and it is not only the members of this Association, etc. According to Mr. Li Bohan, the secretary of the Association, the letter to the Public Works Department has also been drafted and will be published in the near future.</p>

<p>Cheng Zhenjun, the Zhejiang Provincial Commissioner and Director of the Construction Department, went abroad for inspection for half a year, traveling through Japan, the United States, Britain, Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and other countries. His companion, Liu Yiyan, Deputy Director of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Bureau, returned to China yesterday aboard the Japanese ship Suwa Maru. When Mr. Cheng arrived at the Huishan Pier at 12:00 yesterday afternoon, Zhang Jingjiang, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, instructed his wife and sent Secretary Qiu Zongxun as representatives to welcome him at the pier. The Construction Department and other agencies in Zhejiang Province, as well as various hometown associations in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Wuyuan, and Huining, also had representatives and relatives to greet him. It is heard that Chairman Zhang is eager to meet and talk with Mr. Cheng, and also arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and invited Mr. Cheng to talk at his residence. Mr. Cheng has many specialties in construction, and this trip abroad has given him even more insights. Chairman Zhang urged Mr. Cheng to return to his post as soon as possible to plan the construction of the entire province. Reporters from various newspapers visited Mr. Cheng, requesting to talk about his observations and feelings from the inspection to inform the people of the country. After Mr. Cheng arrived at the port, many people visited him, and there were many social engagements, so he had no time to talk for a long time. He promised to hand over an article (Rationalization of Industry) written on the way for reading. It is now published in the special column to share with readers.</p>

<p>Representatives from Both Sides Will Hold a Meeting in Beijing Tomorrow</p>
<p>Appointment of General Manager, Deputy General Manager, and Heads of Various Groups</p>
<p>The contract for the Sino-German Aviation Company was signed by both parties in Beijing on February 21 of this year. The representative of the German Lufthansa, Mr. Schmidt, issued a letter of approval on the 26th of last month, formally approving it. Now, in order to actively organize the establishment of the company, the two parties have decided to convene a meeting of representatives from both sides in Beijing tomorrow (the 11th) to appoint the General Manager, Deputy General Manager, and heads of the Operations, Finance, and Aviation Groups. The German representative, Mr. Schmidt, went to Beijing last Friday (the 5th). The consultant, Liu Shifang, returned to Shanghai from Qingdao the day before yesterday and will go to the capital tonight with the German consultant, Mr. Foucault, to attend tomorrow's meeting. It is faintly heard that the company's route must pass through Soviet Russia, and the Russian side has raised objections. There are nine directors, and the German side has confirmed Schmidt, Busch, and von Sick. Busch is the General Manager of the Hamburg Shipping Company, and von is the Manager of Siemens. The six directors on our side, Wei Yifu and Li Jingzong, have been confirmed. Shuang Qing and Liu Shufan are also expected to be selected. The position of General Manager will also be held by Mr. Wei. The German Deputy General Manager is Mr. Schmidt. The contract began to be negotiated during the Northern Government era. Due to repeated political changes in the two countries, it has taken five years to complete. Although the Sino-American aviation contract was signed earlier than the Sino-German one, it was actually based on the Sino-German one.</p>

<p>The Maritime Industry is Declining in China</p>
<h3 id="e116">Japanese Ships Are Uniquely Prosperous in Chinese Shipping <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Japanese ships to China have always held the principle of gaining an inch and wanting a mile. Since China and Japan revised the new treaty and our country has been working hard to recover inland and coastal navigation rights, the Japanese side has still used diplomatic means to maintain the current status of shipping. However, in terms of business and navigation rights, they are constantly making progress. However, the Daishengchang Company, a small wheel company in the inland rivers of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, was automatically abandoned by the Japanese because they had already made huge profits. The main reason was that there were many ships and the business was slow, and there were occasional dangers on the way. Therefore, it was transferred to the Chinese to take over. If it is the Yangtze River or the coastal routes, the number of Japanese ships has increased rather than decreased. In the first six months of this year, the number of Japanese ships entering and leaving the port has increased by more than 400 compared with last year. This is clear evidence. The latest news on the Japanese shipping industry's progress in China is as follows:</p>
<p>Coastal Ships Expand Routes: Among the Sino-Japanese shipping routes, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha's (NYK) business is uniquely large. In recent years, since the long-distance and coastal shipping have been divided into two companies, operating independently of each other, the company's Japan-Yangtze River route has been transferred to the management of the coastal company. On this route, 9 to 11 regular ships have been designated. The main purpose of its business is to transport steel from Daye, fresh eggs from Anhui, and rapeseed from Wuhu. At the same time, Eastern goods are directly transported to various ports along the Yangtze River. This year, the Japanese shipping industry is also in a downturn, and the number of ships停泊 is increasing. In order to adjust transportation and prevent ships from being empty, the coastal company has planned to open a new route in the ports of North and South China, preparing to use six ships to operate first, three in South China and three in North China. It has submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications for subsidies. It is confirmed that this case has been approved by the Japanese government, and the company is planning to implement it. The Dalian Shipping Company's new South China route can also be opened within the year.</p>
<p>The Number of Japanese Coal Ships is Gradually Decreasing: There are many Japanese "wild chicken" ships operating in Shanghai and the Yangtze River. These ships mostly carry Japanese coal to China. In the first six months of this year, a total of 430,000 tons of Japanese coal arrived in Shanghai, a decrease of 180,000 tons compared with the same period last year. The number of Japanese coal-carrying "wild chicken" ships has also decreased in Shanghai. The reason is the influence of rising gold prices. However, the regular ships between China and Japan have increased rather than decreased in the past two months because Japanese yarn, cloth, white sugar, rubber appliances, silk fabrics, and洋紙 are crowded to be transported to China.</p>
<p>Nissin's Yangtze River Shipping Business is the Best: The number of Shanghai's Yangtze River ships has increased from three companies to six. This year, due to the situation, Chinese Yangtze River ships have been suspended for a long time. Among the foreign ships on the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the business of Taikoo and Jardine is not as good as that of Nissin. According to recent months, Nissin accounts for the first place in the Yangtze River export cargo of the three foreign ships, Taikoo second, and Jardine third. According to the Shanghai Yangtze River cargo, the first is cloth and cotton yarn, and the second is white sugar, cigarettes, kelp, and foreign groceries. These have a larger income from water foot, while ironware, salt, and matches are the worst. In the past six months, the yarn, sugar, tobacco, seafood, and paper loaded by Nissin have been twice as much as Taikoo and 70-80% more than Jardine. Even the miscellaneous sugar in the incoming cargo is better than the British. This time, the Xiang rice transported to Shanghai is mostly carried by Nissin ships.</p>
<p>Liaison Ships are Packed with Passengers: The Shanghai Maru and Nagasaki Maru, the NYK's liaison fast ships, have been crowded with passengers in recent months. The main reason is that the Shanghai summer resort guests who went to Lushan and Guling in previous years could not go this year due to banditry. Most people changed their plans to go to Unzen and other places in Japan. The cabins of all levels were all booked up. The crackdown on Chinese people going to Japan is strict. If there is no entry and exit permit issued by the Japanese Marine Police Department, the ticket will still be refused.</p>

(5) The chairman reported on the resolutions of the general meeting and presented them for discussion as necessary. (6) Wang Zhenchuan proposed whether the issue of establishing a会 should be organized as soon as possible. The majority advocated for a quick implementation and it was passed. (7) Wang Xi proposed that a preparatory committee of seven people should be appointed for the equipment of the会所. It was passed. Shen Jintao, Li Naishuang, Wang Zhenchuan, Zhu Zijiong, Zhou Hongzhang, Bao Renhai, and Zhang Danqing were nominated. (8) Li Naishuang proposed that since this Executive Committee was produced by re-election, it should not continue the old habits of inaction and should issue a declaration to comfort all colleagues. It was passed. The proposer was immediately nominated to draft the declaration. (9) The chairman announced that the special donations for this会 had been initiated by Comrade Zhu Zijiong, and the pledges were quite enthusiastic. However, for more remote agencies, several people should be nominated to contact them. Li Naishuang, Wang Xiaohan, and Shen Fusheng were nominated to be responsible for carrying out the process. It was passed. Other matters such as the preparatory members for the National Day carnival have been nominated. However, the matter of registration with the Party Department must be implemented after the会所 is established. The discussion ended at 9:00.</p>

<p>Will Change Organization and Rules</p>
<p>The China State-Produced United Commercial Center has been open for two months, and the business situation is still stable. Zhang Zilian, the founder of the center, believes that the United State-Produced business is the most powerful propaganda for promoting national goods, and the location of the center is especially concerned by Chinese and foreigners. Although it has only been operating for two months, it has been painstakingly managed. If it is terminated once, it will not only leave people with the criticism of being enthusiastic for a short time, but it may also hinder the future of promoting national goods. He decided to find a way to extend it in order to make it sustainable. Due to the limited personal energy, he specially invited fellow comrades who are enthusiastic about the national goods cause, such as Chen Diexian, Fang Jiange, Wang Hanqiang, Pan Dechun, Chen Yiting, Xu Yunhui, and Zhu Zhenhan, to engage in design. All rules and organizations will be changed, and Cao Zhigong, the chief of general affairs of the center, has started to compile them. It is heard that state-produced manufacturers and commercial figures are supportive of this sustainable plan, and the future is expected to be optimistic.</p>

It is necessary to implement inspection and prohibition to improve the situation. It is now heard that the Shanghai Agricultural Inspection Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining has implemented inspections in various places in Jiangbei in order, and the progress has been smooth. It is heard that the Shanghai Agricultural Inspection Office is also planning to actively prepare in Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places, and inspection can also start soon.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Reasons for Shortages in Public Weight Inspection of Raw Silk <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Letter from the Commodity Inspection Bureau to the Silk Factory Guild</p>
<p>To the Shanghai Silk Factory Guild Committee:</p>
<p>According to reports from member silk factories, since the Raw Silk Inspection Office implemented public weight inspection on a trial basis, the silk factories have suffered significant losses due to shortages. We have specifically written to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to request an explanation of the reasons for these shortages and how to improve the situation. The original letter was published in this newspaper on the 30th of last month. After receiving the letter, the Bureau immediately instructed the Raw Silk Inspection Office to review it and provide a response. They have now sent a detailed response to the Guild, explaining the matter thoroughly for distribution to all members. The original letter is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p>We have received your Guild's letter, which stated (original letter omitted as it was published in the previous issue) etc. We immediately instructed the Raw Silk Inspection Office to review the matter and provide a response. According to their response, the Shanghai Silk Factory Guild's letter raises approximately four points: (1) Agreement on the implementation of the public weight system to maintain fairness in transactions; (2) Request for an explanation of the causes of shortages; (3) Dissatisfaction expressed regarding shortages observed even in the most water-sufficient and dry silk from the Xinchang Silk Factory; (4) Request for research and improvement of public weight inspection methods. The office has carefully reviewed the matter. It is noted that when public weight inspection of raw silk was first implemented, some silk merchants were deeply suspicious. Now, according to the Guild's letter, the silk factories all acknowledge that the implementation of the public weight system can maintain fairness in transactions, strengthening trust in foreign trade. This progress in the thinking of the silk factories, in line with global trends, is a cause for great celebration for the future of China's silk industry. Raw silk, by its nature, is soft and readily absorbs and releases moisture. If the humidity is high or the water content is insufficient, the moisture content will be high and the buyer will suffer losses. If the humidity is low or the water content is sufficient, the seller will feel disadvantaged. European countries, after decades of research and experimentation, determined in 1840 that raw silk should contain 9.91% moisture. At the same time, they also established a method for determining the public weight. First, the total net weight is determined. Next, the total moisture content is determined. Then, the total dry weight is calculated. Finally, 11% is added to the dry weight to arrive at the public weight. This method has been deemed appropriate by various countries and has been used for 90 years. Since raw silk should contain 9.91% moisture, if the silk released by various factories contains more than 9.91% moisture, the public weight will be less than the net weight. If it contains less than 9.91% moisture, the public weight will be more than the net weight. In recent months, the public weight of the silk from most factories has been less than the net weight. The reason for this is that the silk released by the factories contains more than 9.91% moisture. According to the office's research, the reasons for such high moisture content are approximately fivefold: (1) Insufficient water content; (2) Old and worn-out reeling machines that cannot maintain heat; (3) Excessive distance between the reeling room and the silk room. When the silk is dropped, it is easily absorbs moisture. The silk room or silk box may not have adequate water content or may not be humidified, causing the silk from the reeling room to absorb excessive moisture. (4) Export merchants' silk warehouses may be located on the first floor, or on the second or third floors. The air temperature is lower in the upper levels. If the raw silk is stored on the lower levels for three days, the phenomenon of excessive moisture absorption will be particularly evident. (5) Humid weather. If any one of these factors is present, the moisture content of the raw silk will be high, and a shortage will be found during inspection. If several factors are present, the moisture content will be even higher, and the shortage will be even more pronounced. The office inspects raw silk according to internationally recognized scientific methods. The results of the inspection, whether there is a shortage or not, depend on the moisture content of the silk. Technicians cannot manipulate the results or hold preconceived notions that the silk from a particular factory must be inferior or that the silk from another factory must be superior. The attitude of impartiality is maintained when inspecting raw silk from all factories, regardless of the manufacturer, using the same procedures. Therefore, in the past six months, the results of the office's public weight inspection have been consistent with those of the New York Raw Silk Certification Bureau in the United States. If the silk from a certain factory is expected to be superior and a shortage is found, or if the silk is not expected to have a shortage but one is found, not only will foreigners be unconvinced and international trade will be undermined, but the silk factory guild members will also accuse the office of being biased and will be critical of it. While Xinchang may believe its silk to be the most water-sufficient and dry, the office cannot hold such a preconceived notion and must rely solely on the results of the inspection. The pursuit of scientific advancement is endless, and the office has always emphasized the importance of research and improvement. Since its establishment, the public weight inspection has gained international credibility, and the office has begun researching raw silk grading. Now that the Guild members not only express confidence in the adoption of the public weight system but also hope to improve the current method of determining public weight, their high expectations are commendable. However, this method took decades for Europeans and Americans to develop and has been used for 90 years without any perceived flaws. It is unrealistic to expect the office to invent a better method than the current public weight inspection method in a short period of time to fulfill the silk merchants' great wishes. Given China's lagging scientific development, it is indeed not easy to achieve such results in a short period of time. We will keep this goal in mind for the future. As for the application of the public weight inspection method, 40 new Swiss silk drying machines were purchased and meticulously arranged when the office was established, in order to achieve inspection results comparable to those of Western and Eastern countries. In the past few months, we have dared not be complacent and have worked diligently at all times. The weight and accessories of each silk drying machine have been constantly checked and calibrated. The weight before and after drying is carefully checked by a second person. All those who have visited the office are aware of this. The technicians work conscientiously and are fully responsible. As instructed, we have prepared this written response with the results of our review and sent it to the Guild. We hope that you will distribute it to all members for their information.</p>

<p>The Chongqing General Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to Shanghai stating (details omitted): A great disaster has befallen us, resulting in a catastrophe. On the [Eighth month] day of this month (August), a fire broke out outside Chuqimen in Chongqing due to negligence. The fire quickly spread throughout the city and divided into multiple directions, reaching Sanpaifang in the north, Daliangzi in the west, Jinzimen outside the city in the south, Jinzijian above, and Taipingmen below, turning everything into scorched earth. The outskirts were densely populated by the poor, while the city center was the commercial hub with numerous warehouses. The fire was finally extinguished at 10 PM, covering an area of several miles and affecting over 10,000 households. The victims were charred and distraught, their cries shaking the heavens. This is an unprecedented tragedy. Our association, witnessing this, is heartbroken. In addition to immediately dispatching various fire brigades to do their best to extinguish the fire, we conducted a post-disaster survey and found endless debris and countless victims scattered everywhere, exposed to the elements and desperately in need of food. We are currently organizing emergency relief to provide temporary assistance, but the disaster area is too large and the need for relief is overwhelming. Chongqing is impoverished and is already recovering from a severe drought this year. Now, it has suffered this devastating blow. Therefore, we urgently appeal to officials at all levels, as well as various organizations, legal entities, prominent merchants, and charitable individuals, to recognize the severity of the disaster and provide generous assistance. This will not only benefit the tens of thousands of victims but also deeply appreciated by the entire population of Chongqing. We respectfully submit this telegram, hoping for your consideration. All staff members of the Chongqing General Chamber of Commerce bow in gratitude.</p>

Director Shen paid her 10 yuan as travel expenses and urged her to return home.

<p>New Taikoo Warehouse Workers' Union: The 28th joint meeting of the executive committee and staff was held at 8 PM on the 8th. The chairman, Yang Mingwei, conducted the meeting according to protocol. He then reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that according to the report from the second branch staff, Wang Junsong, an employee of warehouse number 12, was suddenly dismissed by the employer during his sick leave. The event was unexpected and unreasonable. The matter was submitted to the union for negotiation. After several negotiations with the employer by standing committee member Yang Mingwei, the employer stated that Wang was old and unable to work. The union believes that it is inappropriate to dismiss him during his sick leave. The matter is now being discussed for a peaceful resolution, with the employer providing three months' salary as compensation. This will be put to a vote if both parties agree. The second branch staff sent a letter stating that worker Tang Yigong owed over 400 yuan in compensation for an accident last year. The amount was deducted from his salary. He still owes over 100 yuan and is still being deducted. Suddenly, the comprador Zhuo claimed that he needed to find a new guarantor, otherwise, he would have to resign. The union believes that since the compensation is already being deducted and there is no outstanding balance, it is unreasonable to say that he needs a new guarantor or resign. Tang Yigong is seeking a resolution from the union because he cannot find a new guarantor and is considered an unemployed person awaiting the union's decision. (It was decided to) send a letter to Tang Yigong and negotiate with the old guarantor. The union will assist after the employer is negotiated with first. The chairman said that manager Hua had stated that all workers in the warehouses should be responsible for guaranteeing the safety of the customers' goods and should not treat them as strangers. If there is a shortage, it would be unacceptable. He requested that all workers be informed that they should pay close attention to goods entering the warehouse, as it is in their best interest. The Taikoo employees are all concerned with their own interests. Huang Naibin of the second branch proposed that many people in the headquarters have not paid their monthly fees. How should this be handled? Some have not paid for three or four consecutive months. He requested a decision. (It was decided to) follow the union's regulations, first issue a warning and urge payment. If they still do not comply, the matter may be submitted to a higher authority for review and handling. September 9th is the anniversary of the General's Guangzhou Uprising. Comrade Ge Ren should be sent to the Municipal Party Committee to attend and participate in the grand event. The meeting was not adjourned.</p>

<p>The Qiantang River tidal bore is at its most magnificent during the ninth year of the Republic [1920]. The waves reached the seventh level of the Zhenhai Pagoda. In the ten years since then, the waves have not exceeded two zhang [~6.6 meters] at most, which those who have grown accustomed to it don't find strange. This year, due to weather conditions, the tidal bore is quite large. The so-called "ghost tide" during this month has already sounded like thunder, and the night tide is even more intense. Residents are awakened from their dreams and brave the rain and wind to watch, day and night. It is expected that the tidal bore during the eighth lunar month will be even greater than in the ninth year of the Republic. As a result, the business of hotels and temporary shops in Ningbo and the seawall area is exceptionally prosperous. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway always runs a special tide-watching train for three days in mid-August on the lunar calendar and prepares tide-watching areas along the Qiantang River in Haining. This year's tidal bore is more magnificent than usual, and the Railway Administration is actively preparing a special train and a riverside viewing area to ensure that tide-watching travelers are not disappointed.</p>
<p>100,000 Yuan Robbery Case</p>
<h3 id="e128">Thief apprehended in Tianjin <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Court Has Dispatched Staff to Tianjin for Extradition</p>
<p>The robbery of 100,000 yuan in banknotes from the Zhejiang Provincial Bank has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. The police learned from the arrested robbers that there were four other perpetrators present at the scene, named Zhu, Ma, Su, and Hu. Ma grabbed the handbag, and Zhu fired the gun. However, they all fled to Tianjin, so the police immediately telegraphed military police agencies in Tianjin, requesting them to be vigilant when ships from Shanghai arrive. The police recently received a telegram from Tianjin stating that Zhu Dexin, the thief who fired the gun, has been apprehended and requested that staff be dispatched to Tianjin for extradition. They then requested the Special District Court to prepare the necessary documents and send detectives to Tianjin. It is expected that the thief will be brought back to Shanghai in four or five days. Ma, Hu, and Su are also being vigorously pursued. According to Da Wan Bao, Zhu, the mastermind behind the 100,000 yuan robbery on North Henan Road on the 28th of last month, was apprehended in Tianjin and is being escorted back to Shanghai by Chinese and foreign detectives dispatched by the Public Concession police. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai on Friday and will be handed over to the Special District Court for questioning on Saturday. According to the accomplice detained at the Old Gate Police Station, Zhu was the one who initiated the robbery of the Zhejiang Provincial Bank's funds and fired the gun. In addition, Ma, Wu, and Su are also major suspects in the case and are currently being pursued by the police.</p>

<h3 id="e129">City Ferryboats Launched the other day <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>In order to develop water transportation and facilitate the travel of citizens on both sides of the Huangpu River, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau ordered two high-speed large ferryboats last year to operate between the Bund of Nanjing Road in Puxi and the Donggou area of the Qingning Market in Pudong. The cost was ten times higher than that of other small steamers, but the fares remained at the same level as ten years ago, so everyone considered the prices to be low, the ride to be smooth and comfortable. However, the citizens of Gaoqiao felt regret that the new ferryboats could not reach their area, which is not far from Donggou. Therefore, the municipal government instructed the Public Utilities Bureau to actively prepare for extending the line to Gaoqiao. After receiving the order, the bureau contracted with the Hexing Factory on June 10th of this year to build the third and fourth ferryboats for use in Gaoqiao. Each boat cost approximately 70,000 taels, including the engine. Each boat is 108 feet long, 20 feet wide, 8 feet 6 inches high, and has a draft of 5 feet, a horsepower of 200, and a capacity of 600 passengers, with a speed of 11 knots. Compared to the original numbers one and two ferryboats, the equipment and layout have been further improved and perfected, and the latest artistic ideas have been incorporated, such as the electric lights, door latches, and switches, which were all ordered from famous German factories and are exquisite and durable. After the contract was signed, the Hexing Factory actively built the boats and launched them at 2:30 PM on September 8th. Representatives from the municipal government, the manager of the Municipal Bank, and the director and technicians of the secretariat of the bureau all visited the boats and were satisfied with the construction and launching. In order to avoid unnecessary formalities, the bureau did not have a bottle-breaking ceremony or other rituals. The factory explained to the Public Utilities Bureau that, based on decades of experience, they voluntarily enlarged and widened the materials and dimensions specified in the bureau's specifications and drawings, without requesting an increase in price. This is a rare occurrence in the shipbuilding industry, and their enthusiasm for supporting municipal construction is commendable. The engineer from the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau also visited the boats the other day and considered them to be the most beautiful ferryboats in the East.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Overview of Construction in this City in August <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>In August of this year, the Bureau of Public Works issued permits for a total of 145 construction projects, 217 repair projects, 100 miscellaneous projects, and 28 demolition projects. Compared to the previous month, construction and demolition were roughly the same, while repair and miscellaneous projects each increased by about one-third. Compared to the same month last year, construction was similar, while repair and miscellaneous projects decreased slightly, and demolition increased slightly. The total construction area in the city (excluding rural bungalows) was approximately 3,540 square *fang*, a decrease of over 900 square *fang* compared to the previous month, but still an increase compared to May. The estimated total value was over 1,141,000 yuan, a decrease of over 80,000 yuan compared to the previous month. In terms of area by district, the French Concession south of Shanghai was the highest, followed by Zhabei, then the French Concession west of Shanghai and Yangjing. In terms of estimated value, the French Concession south of Shanghai was the highest, followed by the French Concession west of Shanghai, then Zhabei, and finally Yangjing. The reason for the discrepancy between the ranking of estimated value and area is that there are many large buildings along the roads built beyond the boundaries of the French Concession west of Shanghai, so its estimated value is higher than Zhabei. As for Yangjing, it is mostly bungalows, so it cannot be compared with the French Concession west of Shanghai. Zhabei district, which usually ranks second in terms of area and estimated value, had jumped to first place in May, June, and July of this year, but suddenly decreased this month. There were no particularly large projects this month. In the French Concession west of Shanghai, there were three locations with estimated values of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan each. In the French Concession south of Shanghai, the Yilexin Housing Agency built commercial housing and cement warehouses at Beijixiang Lane, outside of Waitan Road, covering a total area of 250 square *fang*, with a total estimated value of approximately 107,000 yuan. Also, in the Jiangwan district, a Mr. Chen built the Dizang Temple and sacrificial pavilion at the end of Yuexiu Road and Jiangchang Road, covering an area of 210 square *fang*, with an estimated value of approximately 102,000 yuan. As of the end of August, only half of the dangerous buildings that were ordered to be forcibly demolished had actually been demolished.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Negotiate the Lu Lianqiao Case <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, according to the letter from the Shangyu Association in Shanghai, dated August 19th, this association received a report from Qian Yusun (teacher at Chengzhong School), representative of Lu Lianqiao's son, Lu Bingjun, an employee of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. The report stated that on the afternoon of the 7th of this month at 5:50 PM, Lu Lianqiao was waiting for a tram at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shimen Road. At that time, an American, He Mo Li, was driving car number 11578 from west to east at high speed, without honking the horn. As a result, the front wheel of the car hit his father, causing him to fall unconscious beside the tram door. If He had even a little conscience, he would have stopped the car immediately, and it would not have resulted in serious injury and death. However, He continued to drive at high speed, and his father was hit violently by the rear wheel, smashing him against the iron pillar of the tram station, causing severe head injuries. He immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. He, at this point, did not even take his father to the hospital in his car, but drove away. Later, a patrolman sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died on the morning of the 11th. The Special Court appointed Prosecutor Xu to examine the body, and instructed He to be responsible for compensation, but He refused to comply. (Omission) We beg your association to support us." After discussion by the executive committee of this association, it was decided that the matter concerned the lives of Chinese people and the dignity of the nation, and that the association should represent Lu Bingjun and send a letter to various organizations to seek unanimous support. (Omission) It was handed over to the standing committee for active handling. Therefore, we are writing to request the assistance of the general assembly and to request that your opinions on assistance be communicated to us. We have learned that the American consular jurisdiction in China has not yet been abolished, and our country's laws cannot effectively restrain the murderer in this case. This association believes that the only way is to follow the case of the British soldier beating Zhang Xueliang to death last year, and request your government to negotiate seriously with the American consul in Shanghai in order to achieve the purpose of compensating the victim's family, punishing the murderer, and protecting the lives of the people. According to the aforementioned letter, we are writing to inform you, hoping that you will take this into consideration and implement it, as it is a matter of public concern." A similar letter was also sent to the American Consul General in Shanghai, Ke Ninghan, which is omitted for brevity.</p>

<p>Meisheng, the British director of the Zhanghuabang workshop of the Dredging Bureau, was found to have withheld wages from short-term copper workers, failed to provide formal positions to those who had worked for three years, and solicited large bribes. As a result, the workers became suspicious and jointly submitted a petition to the head office, requesting promotions and increased salaries. Song, the director of the Dredging Bureau, found that the wage figures listed in the original petition did not match, and that wages had been withheld by 30 to 50 cents per day. When the director requested leave to return home, the deputies, Chinese nationals Cai Rongfu and Tang Xuanqing, were interrogated by the bureau, and both claimed that it was done by Meisheng. However, as the matter involved suspicion, Cai and Tang were sent to the General Police Station for bail. Meisheng was then summoned back to Shanghai by telegram. After repeated interrogations of the victimized workers from Zhanghuabang at the bureau by the Chinese and foreign directors of the Dredging Bureau, they all testified that the foreign director had withheld wages and solicited large bribes. When asked about this, Meisheng claimed that he had been extremely loyal to his service in the Dredging Bureau and that he had deducted wages and stored them separately to reward diligent workers because the workers were negligent, which led to the slanderous accusation. It is now reported that Director Song and Customs Officer Mei have investigated and determined that, no matter what, the workers' hard-earned wages should not be withheld, and it has been found that wages have been withheld for more than a year, which cannot be denied. This practice must not continue in this bureau, and Director Meisheng should be immediately dismissed. The Chinese nationals Cai Rongfu and others concealed the matter and failed to report it, and should also be dismissed.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Trial in the British Police Court</p>
<h3 id="e133">Indian Constables Accused of Serious Insult Case <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>According to the *Continental News*, Indian constables Meigexin and Luerxin, stationed at 26 and 28 Jiangxi Road, were accused of seriously insulting a Mr. Ni, an employee of a certain inn, on the night of the 6th. The trial opened yesterday (the 8th) in the British Police Court. The police lawyer, Wen De, stated that on that day at midnight, the victim was waiting for a tram on the road when the two defendants approached and dragged him to the building at 26 Jiangxi Road. The victim initially mistook them for street patrolmen, so he went with them. However, upon arriving at the location, they subjected him to indecent behavior and threatened him with a gun. The victim then went out to the road and told a Chinese constable, inviting him to go to 26 Jiangxi Road. One of the two defendants even offered five silver dollars, hoping to bribe him. The constable then reported to the Western police officer Halai at the General Police Station, who arrested them. After the judge questioned the circumstances of the arrest, he adjourned the court and will continue the trial tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Establishment of the Pacific News Agency <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The French Havas News Agency is an international news organization, its importance matching that of the British Reuters News Agency. Its Far East news operations originally cooperated with Reuters and also sent its own reporters to gather news. Since the European War, the focus of world competition has shifted from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Havas News Agency, feeling the needs of the times, took over the existing Pacific News Agency in Vietnam and expanded it, and signed a contract with a Japanese news agency to exchange news. In addition to the original correspondents around the world, it also established correspondents in Vietnam and Japan, and established a general manager in Shanghai to take charge of the overall operation, naming it the Pacific News Agency. The first step is to import world news into China and publicize the true situation of China to the world. The second step is to cooperate with a Chinese news agency and send reporters to important locations in China. As for its news coverage, it will provide detailed reports on all kinds of world political, economic, and financial news that are relevant to the Far East, including the causes and effects, as well as opinions regarding China and Japan. In addition, the movements of Soviet Russia and the Third International are of great importance, and it will clarify what others have not detailed or even researched. Furthermore, it will communicate several times a month on topics such as North America, the Philippines, and Japan, and their opinions and facts regarding China, as well as the true situation in China, to supplement the shortcomings of telegrams. Although the interests of France and China are relatively shallow, its publicity will be more bland, and the Pacific News Agency plans to open up new paths in addition to the methods adopted by news agencies in various countries, which will definitely be beneficial to China. It is now scheduled to begin issuing drafts on September 10.</p>

<p>Yuan, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, believes that setting up altars and holding Taoist rituals during the Zhongyuan Festival is superstitious, wastes money and labor, and is extremely harmful. He had previously issued a notice banning it and ordered all district police stations to investigate and ban it. However, the ignorant people generally disobeyed in secret, and there were still cases of raising funds to hire monks and Taoists to set up altars and hold rituals. In recent days, the police chief of the first precinct of the fourth district of Zhabei discovered that residents were still raising funds to set up altars and hold rituals at Zhaohe Lane on Xinjiang Road and Huaxingfang on Huaxing Road. Zheng Yunquan, Zhu Yanling, Cao Guiqing, Chen Rongji, and others who were the leaders were arrested and punished to eliminate superstition.</p>

<p>Chen Jigeng, a native of Ningbo, 30 years old, came to Shanghai from his hometown a few days ago and stayed at his uncle Chen Shiqing's place in Xinpingfang, Tangshan Road. Yesterday morning, he went to his brother-in-law's house in Gongyili, Zhabei, for lunch and then returned to Xinpingfang, Tangshan Road. As he was walking near the Lihong Bridge, he suddenly heard a gunshot, and a bullet struck him in the abdomen, exiting the other side. Chen did not feel any pain at the time, but saw a person wearing a light green gauze shirt and trousers running past him. Looking back, he saw four people, all wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers, stumbling and catching up, and then fleeing without a trace. Chen walked a few more steps and suddenly felt pain in his abdomen. When he saw the wound, blood gushed out. Jigeng was shocked and fell to the ground. Passersby called the police, hired a car, and sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. According to what Chen told people, he had been a soldier in the patrol team in Wenzhou. One day, he and his colleague Zhao Ayuan and others were playing mahjong, and they had a dispute over 4,000 coins. Ayuan and I had an argument, and the result was that it was brought to the platoon leader, and it was dismissed. A week ago in Shanghai, I suddenly met Ayuan on the road. He grabbed my chest and asked me to go to a certain place for tea and reasoning. Because I was timid, I didn't go at the appointed time. My gunshot wound this time may have been instigated by him to plot against me.</p>

<p>Cheng A'gen had previously ordered six cars from the United States, with the American Feng Bank providing remittance to Shanghai. However, Cheng failed to pay for the goods for a long time, and the American Feng Bank filed a lawsuit. After the judgment, Cheng continued to delay. The bank then asked the Huamei and Liang companies to estimate the price of the cars and auctioned them off. After deducting the remittance amount, there was still a debt of over 8,000 taels. When the order was placed, the bank's comprador was Zhang Xingcun, so Zhang signed the contract. This spring, Zhang resigned from his position as comprador, and all transactions were settled clearly. Cheng's debt was paid by Zhang on his behalf, and the American Feng Bank withdrew the case against Cheng. Zhang obtained the debt claim and hired lawyers Shen Yuesheng and Zhang Deqin to file another lawsuit against Cheng. The initial trial ruled that the defendant should repay the amount in full and bear the litigation costs. However, Cheng refused to accept the judgment and filed an appeal. Zhang, represented by lawyer Shen, submitted a detailed statement of the facts and reasons for defense. Now, Hu Yigu, the presiding judge of the civil division of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, has held a hearing, summoned both parties for examination and concluded that Cheng A'gen's appeal was groundless and the judgment was rejected. The judgment has been served on both parties for compliance.</p>

When Xu's farmhand, Wang A'gou, heard the noise and opened the door to investigate, a bandit wearing a white undershirt, blue cloth pants, a flat top haircut and barefoot, shot Wang twice, causing him to fall to the ground injured. The thief, holding a gun in one hand and a candle in the other, went straight into Xu's bedroom and opened the door. At this time, the owner, Xu Fangshi, had been awakened from his dream. Hearing the gunshots, he knew it was a robbery. Fortunately, Xu had a self-defense rifle, so he loaded the bullets, extinguished the lights, and waited to fire. When the thief approached, Xu aimed accurately in the dark and fired a shot, hitting the thief in a vital spot, killing him instantly. The candle he was holding fell at the thief's feet, causing him to be scorched by the fire. Several other thieves broke into the back door and fired several shots, but did not dare to enter. Xu also fired back. The gunshots echoed loudly and were heard far and wide. The thieves, seeing that the barefoot thief had been shot and killed, were frightened and did not rob any property, but retreated towards Hengtang. Xu did not dare to pursue them.

They even had trouble paying the butcher and rice shop. Last month, Yao invited Pan and Fu to the restaurant to discuss the situation. As a result of their discussion, Pan and Fu readily agreed to go to the countryside to raise funds. However, after turning around for ten days, they still hadn't returned to Shanghai. Yao was at his wit's end, finding it impossible to maintain the business. Yesterday morning, around six or seven o'clock, he got up and went out to buy one yuan's worth of raw opium.

<h3 id="e158">Rationalization of Industry by Cheng Zhenjun <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>A Great Revolution in Economic Thought</p>
<p>Recommendations of the International Economic Conference</p>
<p>New Trends in the Industrial World of Various Countries</p>
<p>The Only Savior of China's Industry</p>
<p>During this trip abroad to inspect construction administration and important construction projects, we spent half a year, traveled through nine countries, visited more than eighty government agencies and more than thirty social organizations in various countries, and visited nearly a hundred major factories and major projects. We obtained a lot of materials and feelings and will gradually select the important ones for publication. Now, at the beginning of our return to the country, we are deeply questioned by relatives, friends, and reporters. Therefore, we will report in advance on an issue that the Chinese government, the industrial world, and the general public should pay attention to. We hope that comrades and compatriots across the country will conduct in-depth research. What is this matter? It is the so-called industrial rationalization. What exactly is industrial rationalization? It cannot be explained clearly in a few words. We will exhaust the source and tell its origin, then the establishment of its term, and then select and translate several well-known definitions so that readers can think about it. The idea of rationalization originated in Germany. After the European War, Germany was in chaos, all industries were declining, communism was rampant, and huge reparations had to be collected and paid, which was even more painful. The whole country was worried and unable to live in peace. The situation was difficult and forced to this point. Therefore, the only way out was to strive for improvement in industry, to make exports more than imports, and to earn money to make up for the losses. Therefore, the philosopher and industrialist W. Rathenau published great proposals and detailed plans, published many books, and repeatedly stated how to transform industry and how to correct ideas. He also drafted an abstract term to summarize it, called Rationalization. As a result, people across the country rushed to buy and read it, and paper in Luoyang was expensive for a time. The government also expressed deep sympathy and adopted it, establishing the National Efficiency Conference Office. It convened more than 6,000 industrial leaders, divided them into several committees, and studied the transformation of economy and industry. The result was excellent. Therefore, all parties cooperated and proceeded according to the plan, and the industry made a major turnaround. Production increased, consumption decreased, and foreign trade gradually improved. This obvious achievement shocked the world and made people gasp. Seeing this, the League of Nations held the World Economic Conference in Geneva in May 1927. The attendees were representatives of employers, workers, and economists. The Industrial Committee of the conference, referring to the rules and regulations of Germany, decided on many proposals, which were also collectively called Rationalization (Rationalisation in English). This proposal is the specific condition of rationalization, which was formally adopted by the plenary session. It is expected that the people of the country will want to know its contents. The provisions are translated as follows: The resolution of the Industrial Committee of the Geneva Economic Conference on May 17, 1927, Rationalization: Now, because the rational organization of production and distribution is one of the important reasons for increasing production, improving labor conditions, and reducing production costs, and because the purpose of this rationalization is also to (1) obtain the maximum efficiency of labor with the least effort; (2) reduce various different styles (those styles are different, and there are no obvious benefits), study manufacturing methods, the use of standard parts and supplements; (3) eliminate the consumption of raw materials and power; (4) simplify the distribution of goods; (5) eliminate unnecessary transportation, excessive financial burdens, and useless intermediaries. In addition, the wise and lasting application of rationalization methods is generally expected to achieve the following things: First, in the social aspect, the standard of living is improved and stability is increased. Second, in the aspect of consumers, prices are reduced, and goods are more suitable for their needs. Third, in the aspect of various producers, there are more and more reliable benefits, which are fairly distributed to them. In addition, the implementation of rationalization must be cautious to prevent the legitimate interests of workers from being damaged, and appropriate measures must be taken so that the problem of unemployment will not hinder the progress of rationalization at the beginning. In addition, rationalization, in the strict sense of its relationship with labor organization, requires the cooperation of employers and the assistance of business agencies, industrial agencies, and scientific experts. Therefore, the International Economic Conference suggests that all governments, public organizations, business agencies, and ordinary people should pay attention to the following matters: First, producers should devote their efforts to the above aspects and especially implement the following three items: (A) Promote and encourage people to study and compare the most efficient methods of rationalization and scientific management, the easiest steps to implement, and their economic and social impact through various methods; (B) Adopt rationalization in industry, agriculture, commerce, and finance, not only in large-scale enterprises, but also in medium and small-sized enterprises, and even handicraftsmen and shopkeepers should use it. The organization and needs of family life may be able to obtain useful information that must be known; (C) Pay special attention to appropriate means to obtain the best, healthiest, and most respected labor employment, such as job selection, training and leadership, the distribution of work and rest, methods of remuneration for giving a part of the benefits when production increases, in short, the conditions of labor and life must be beneficial to the development and consolidation of their personal personality (2) Systematically and internationally standardize raw materials, accessories, and products of universal trade on a national scale, and eliminate obstacles in production and commerce, which occur only in countries that standardize as a policy (3) Implement research on the best methods adopted by various countries for the application of the above principles and the final results obtained on an international scale, that is, take the research already conducted between several countries as a blueprint, and encourage the exchange of knowledge between relevant groups (4) Further publicize in various places to make people aware of the benefits and benefits arising from rationalization and scientific management and to make them aware of the possibility of gradual realization. At that time, the International Economic Conference was greatly hindered by the economic development of various countries during and after the European War and was eager to adopt rationalization to promote production. The basic industries, such as textiles and coal, can also be restored to their original state. At the same time, it also wanted to promote the economic development of various countries with an international attitude, without being biased towards the prosperity of one or several countries. The Industrial Committee also paid attention to several important developments, which are translated together as follows: (A) Physiology and psychology should be used to study the working life of individuals in the family, in agriculture, in commerce, or in industry; (B) Study the activities of groups according to the same disciplines, and pay attention to various issues, such as methods of paying wages, employee bonuses and employee shareholding, labor-management relations, and other methods of cooperation; (C) In order to establish a scientific basis for production technology, efforts should be made to apply natural sciences, chemistry, physics, mineralogy, and mathematics more widely, because these disciplines are closely related to the raw materials and manufacturing methods of industry; (D) With the same disciplinary thinking, try to apply them to ordinary technical problems arising from the management of individual enterprises, such as house layout, transportation, bookkeeping, office methods, planning, daily affairs, markets, etc., commonly known as (material management); (E) Strive to improve the general organization of production and distribution from a national and international perspective, such as eliminating consumption, simplification and standardization, horizontal mergers and vertical mergers, labor-management contracts, government and public organizations' facilities, the behavior of labor-management organizations, mass production and distribution, the prediction of business trends, and statistical research on the world situation, such as the supply of raw materials, labor, markets, transportation, and power. The Industrial Committee summarized such important developments and its resolutions under the term rationalization. Since this term came out, there have been various explanations, many of which are wrong. I have explained its origin in detail above. Now, I will record the two more satisfactory definitions below. The World Economic Conference stipulates that (Industrial rationalization is a technical and organizational method used to obtain the least consumption of labor and raw materials. All scientific organization of labor, standardization of raw materials and products, simplification of manufacturing methods, and improvement of transportation and market systems are included.) The German National Efficiency Conference stipulates that (Industrial rationalization is to seek knowledge and use various methods with an academic and systematic organization to improve the general economic situation. Its purpose is to supply a large number of cheap, high-quality goods and increase the standard of living. This requires the joint efforts of all aspects of society.) From these two definitions, the resolutions of the International Economic Conference, and the important developments noted by its Industrial Committee, we have a considerable understanding of rationalization. However, what we should distinguish most is that rationalization not only tells us to solve various problems in business with scientific methods, but also makes us have a belief that the world's economic life can be managed rationally, and it is needed. This is a major revolution in world economic thought, and we should pay attention to it. Since the development of manufacturing, the principles of economists, the so-called movements of demand and supply, the so-called recurrent cycles of activity and depression, are often regarded as golden rules. It means that more demand means higher prices, higher prices mean more supply, and more supply means lower prices, so they correspond to each other to achieve balance. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e160">Interesting Anecdotes in the Barefoot Trend <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Shui</p>
<p>The barefoot movement has been recorded in this publication. Some fashionable women in Shanghai have already been walking barefoot on the streets. And in foreign countries, women's bare feet have become a custom. Since the beginning of summer, there is no pretty woman who is not barefoot, which shows how popular bare feet are. Recently, I read several interesting anecdotes about bare feet in Western newspapers. I am eager to translate them to provide readers with a smile.</p>
<p>Barefoot Maid Fired Recently, the Labor Court in Berlin (the Labor Court specializes in handling labor-management disputes) accepted a very interesting case. The plaintiff was a maid. She was hired by the defendant in May to work as a maid in the defendant's home. At that time, a one-year contract was signed. Less than a week ago, she was suddenly dismissed by the defendant. Therefore, she requested relief. The court asked why she was dismissed. The defendant said that because she was often barefoot and did not understand manners, the master dismissed her. The plaintiff protested, saying that the court should pay attention to the current barefoot trend. In the streets and at banquets, which beautiful woman is not barefoot? Don't they all understand etiquette? As a maid, I can't afford socks, so I took advantage of the situation and went barefoot. I was dismissed for this. Isn't it unfair? Also, I help out at the defendant's house, changing clothes every day and keeping very clean. I just didn't wear a pair of socks, and they accused me of wrongdoing, violating the contract. Please, court, make a fair ruling. The judge who heard the case thought it was very reasonable. He said at the time that bare feet are not a vice, and now it is a popular custom. Even he (the judge) sometimes likes to go barefoot. His daughter also often goes barefoot when she goes out. Therefore, bare feet do not violate etiquette, let alone be used as a reason to dismiss a maid. The defendant heard this and thought that he would definitely lose this lawsuit. He immediately stated that he was willing to settle out of court.</p>
<p>Female Actors Find It Difficult to Go on Stage Barefoot Since the trend of women going barefoot has become so popular, female actors in theaters have also learned to be fashionable and go on stage barefoot. Recently, a theater owner in London named Jones suddenly issued a notice prohibiting female actors from going on stage barefoot. Someone asked him the reason for the prohibition. He said that there was no reason, but it was just unsightly to go on stage with bare feet. Women walking on the street with their feet not wearing socks is no problem. But on a high stage where everyone can see, it seems a bit jarring to be barefoot. This boss's announcement is really interesting. Speaking of women's bare feet, according to ordinary people's arguments, there are several benefits. First, it is comfortable, because less a pair of socks is less a layer of restraint. Second, it is economical. A pair of women's silk stockings costs up to twenty-five yuan. Wouldn't not wearing socks save a lot of money? Third, it is innocent. Not wearing socks reveals the original appearance of the feet, which doesn't add a bit of beautiful curves? Fourth, if it's summer, it's cool. But conversely, when winter comes, the matter of bare feet becomes a problem.</p>

<p>Lotus Root Cake Take several sections of lotus root and grate them into thin strips on a rice basket. If it is salty, add some salt and chopped green onion. If it is sweet, add a little white sugar. Mix it with flour and fry it in a frying pan until both sides are golden brown. It is loose, crispy, and delicious.</p>
<p>Apple Dumplings Cut apples into small pieces and fill them with bean paste or walnut and jujube filling. Wrap a layer of caul fat on the outside, mix well with egg white batter, and fry them in a frying pan to make dumplings. The taste is quite beautiful.</p>
<p>Gorgon Nut Cake Fresh gorgon nuts are peeled, placed in a stone mortar, and pounded with a pestle. Mix with powdered rock candy and cook into a cake on the pot. It is sweet and delicious.</p>

<p>— Lanxi</p>
<p>After our noble countrymen are born for a month, their parents carefully give them a special name. If this special name does not encounter any changes in their lives—damage to their reputation, frustration on the political stage, or even being wanted—they are not willing to change it. Many inexplicable parents call their children cats, dogs, A Mao, A Pig, or those unbearably vulgar names such as A Jin, A Yin, A Bao, A Yu. There are countless other people with the same name. The former Foreign Minister had a Chen Youren, but there is also a Chen Youren in the Translation Section of the Railway Bureau. Because the service agencies are different, they are irrelevant, so there is no need for you to change or me to change. However, interestingly, ten pairs have been found among the two-way staff, with each two people sharing the exact same honorific name and surname. For example, the staff member of the section chief's office in the central section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and the person in charge of the two-way resident's vehicle affairs have the same name (Chen Yongqing). The luggage attendant and the Nanjing telegrapher have the same name (Wang Xixian). The servant Wu A'er in the general affairs section and the station attendant at Benniu Station are the same. The roadman Zhou Rongsheng in Zhang Huabang and the luggage clerk at Changzhou Station are the same. The roadman Liu Er in Nanjing and the station attendant at Nanjing Jiangbian Station are the same. After this was discovered, the Management Bureau felt it was inconvenient and has now ordered five people to change their names to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>In this regard, we should acknowledge the Management Bureau's meticulousness and care. But I still have to nag these five people. When changing their names, be sure to carefully flip through the staff directory. Don't learn (avoiding the wind and avoiding the snow). The name that is changed cannot (be the same as others). Thousands of colleagues have high expectations here.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Commentary on Two Famous Roles in the Beikai Records <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>

<p>In recent years, the talents of net roles have become increasingly scarce. The Tongchui (copper hammer) role has even been lamented as difficult to find talent. The framed painted face is relatively broad, but there are not many good materials to be found. Broadly speaking, two people can be obtained from the northern and southern pear garden lines. Who are these two? They are Jin Shaoshan in the south and Hao Shuchen in the north. Hao is the direct disciple of the late famous net Huang San. He has a strong spirit and full of heart and soul. He concentrates on acting and does not slack off at all. Therefore, each play has its own highlights and its own characteristics. He has enjoyed a great reputation for more than ten years and has never suffered any setbacks. Now, he is becoming more and more successful and has a tendency to take the lead in the net role. Shaoshan is the son of Jin Xiushan, the master of the net role. He has specialized in framing since he was a child. Recently, he has also been willing to concentrate on learning the copper clock. Such as Exploring Yin Mountain, Black Wind Scarf, Breaking the Empress Dowager, Going to Heaven Terrace, and Entering the Palace Twice, his singing is meaningful and has the style of his father. The source is from the same vein, and it is better than others. The Beikai Record Company was established the year before last and has invited almost all the famous actors from the north and south to record. Shouchen and Shaoshan are of course also in the net. Shouchen is eccentric in nature and originally had the idea of not recording. Later, after repeated persuasion from friends, he agreed to make an exception to try. When the record was released, Shouchen opened it and listened to it, and suddenly slapped the table and shouted, "If I had known there would be such a result, what harm would it be to record it?" Hearing Shouchen's words, we can know the superb technology of the Beikai engineers. Shouchen recorded a total of four records: One is Loyalty and Filial Piety, One is Beating the Dragon Shed and Beating Cao Bao, One is Eliminating Three Evils, and One is Night Trial of Pan Hong. The Trial of Pan is a Erhuang play, with the thickest rhyme. The first three are pieces with singing and reading, and are particularly vivid and varied. Shuangda is a piece with Erhuang and Xipi, which is more appropriate to match, so the hobbyists are particularly numerous. In addition to Shaoshan's collaboration with Tan Xiaopei and Fu Ying's father and son to record the complete (Catching and Releasing) (Searching for the Orphan and Saving the Orphan), he also recorded four records: (Farewell My Concubine), (Famen Temple) (with Fu Ying), (Golden Platform) (with Xiaopei), and (Trial of Li Qi). All of them are masterpieces of his life. The metaphor of (Yellow Bell Dalu) can only be used by Shaoshan. There is nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>Short News The candies and pastries of Sullivan in Shanghai are fragrant and linger in the mouth of the eater. Everyone praises them. Now there is a shop called Masikai next to the day and night bank in the Great World. Its food is so exquisite and wonderful that it is not only not below Sullivan, but it is no different from Sullivan. The eater thinks it is strange and asks the waiter. The waiter said that the big manager (that is, the cook) is from Sullivan. It is appropriate that they have different songs but the same work. Those who love sweets and pastries, why don't you try them? (Diner)</p>

<h3 id="e164">The Internal Politics of Post-War Poland (3) <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Sent from Paris by Li Liu-zeng</p>
<p>The local autonomy system stipulated by the new constitution should have been implemented everywhere on the same basis. However, the various legal systems adopted in different regions before the constitution was established could not be abolished immediately. Therefore, the first task of the legislators was to eliminate the most obvious differences in various regions and allow those who had not previously enjoyed autonomy to share the benefits. The provisional government specifically ordered the implementation of autonomy in Polish territories formerly under Russian rule, which is one example. This is because Polish territories formerly under German and Austrian rule had already enjoyed local autonomy due to the application of German and Austrian laws, while Polish territories formerly under Russian rule alone felt left out.</p>
<p>Therefore, the local autonomy in various parts of Poland is now implemented on different bases, and there is no unified system. The old German territory of Hante-Bilesie provides clear evidence, as its autonomous powers are particularly extensive due to a special decree.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the administrative unification of Poland is now maintained not by the laws themselves, but by the local officials who execute the central government's powers. Because local officials, such as county magistrates and town magistrates, can be arbitrarily transferred to their counties by the central government, from the old German Polish territories to the old Russian Polish territories, without restriction.</p>
<p>The establishment of Poland's administrative unity is inherently difficult, while its judicial unity is even more difficult. Poland has five different judicial systems nationwide. In the Warsaw (Warsaw) area, Napoleonic law is applied. In the eastern provinces, Russian law is applied. In other places, the laws of Germany, Austria, Hungary, and other countries are separately adopted. This is true for civil law, as well as for civil procedure law, commercial law, criminal law, and so on. Therefore, when Poland was restored, the regulations regarding family rights, mortgage systems, judicial evidence, and the identification of petty crimes were completely different from place to place.</p>

<p>Chapter 14: Emerald Bamboo Tears Stain Her Face, Her Heart Breaks; Red Lotus Fragrance Fades, a Maiden's Soul Departs</p>
<p>For a man in his forties to take a concubine was considered an extremely proper thing in China. The main reason why Zhang Yiqing was able to move Cuiyun's heart and persuade her to marry him was one thing. He often told her, "Cuiyun, I won't lie to you. I do have a wife at home. But this wife is as good as nonexistent, because she is a country woman who is only fit to live in the countryside of Ningbo and not fit to come to Shanghai. That's why I've been doing business in Shanghai for more than twenty years, and she has never come once. They are used to living in the countryside and are not used to coming to Shanghai. However, once or twice a year, I go back to my hometown in Ningbo to see them. If you don't believe me, ask my friends. If you follow me, we'll rent a house in Shanghai. Every month, I'll take a boat to Hankou once or twice. We'll go together to see the scenery of the Yangtze River. Wouldn't that be great?" Although he said so, Cuiyun knew that the people of Ningbo called their wives "old women." And those Ningbo old women were very fierce. Last time, there was a young lady in her neighbor's room who took a customer, who was also from Ningbo. Somehow, her affair was leaked, and her old woman found out. That day, this customer happened to be staying in the next room on business. She found out about it. Early in the morning, she kicked down the door and caught them. The two of them were still entangled in bed. Unexpectedly, she broke into the room and dragged them both out of the covers. She didn't dare hit her own man, but she slapped the young lady and pulled out her hair. Her husband couldn't stand it and hit her too. She rolled on the ground, crying and shouting, "I don't want to live anymore! You're helping that whore to beat your old woman!" She shouted for the police to go to the police station together. That Ningbo woman was truly fierce. She rolled around on the floor for a while, her hair disheveled and her pants falling down. For a while, people from three or four rooms upstairs and downstairs came up to watch the commotion. Her husband saw that it was too embarrassing, put on his clothes, and ran away in a puff of smoke. Many people in the rooms tried to mediate, saying, "Your man isn't here. What are you still making a fuss about? We're hanging up signs to welcome guests. The Public Works Bureau collects donations for legitimate business. We didn't drag your man off the street. You can't control your own man, but you come here to make trouble. If you don't leave, we'll all go to the police station together. You won't get any advantage." She saw that her man had left too, so she smoothed her hair and tightened her belt, and walked downstairs cursing and shouting. She hired a rickshaw and left. The young lady in the next room felt she had lost face and made such a joke. She had suffered such hardship herself and was too embarrassed to see anyone. Unexpectedly, she ate raw opium. Fortunately, she was rescued early and saved her life.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Continued Slight Decline in Financial Gold Markets <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Attitude Extremely Hesitant. Yesterday, the 9th, the state of the gold market was hesitant, with highs and lows, sometimes fluctuating by two or three taels, totaling six taels for the entire day. The market atmosphere was volatile and unpredictable. Professionals held divergent views, resulting in a potential downward trend. Eventually, foreign exchange bills were seen to be easing and contracting, with banks willing to sell. The front market bought and sold unevenly, with Da De Cheng, Yuan Mao Yong, and Yuan Heng all making purchases, while Zhi Feng, Yong Fu Chang, and others were selling. Large strips saw increases, opening low and continuing to fall to within 60 taels. Rebounding due to strong buying interest, prices rose to 65 taels before weakening slightly. Cash prices were approximately 22 taels higher. Later in the market, buying interest initially waned but then revived, suddenly surging to over 65 taels. Unexpectedly, at 4 o'clock, foreign exchange bills suddenly turned weak, and dealers were eager to sell, leading to a rapid downward turn of four taels, nearly collapsing. With sharp reversals, the market became even more chaotic. Only the deferred market is not far off and should not undergo major changes, as short sellers dare not try to take risks to prevent pressure from all sides.</p>
<p>Front Market Low Then High. The October opening price in the morning was 561.2 taels, a decrease of 1.2 taels, influenced by the rise in silver strips by 1/16 and the increase in silver prices by 3/8. Sellers in the rough market were consistently high, gradually falling to 59.6 taels. Foreign exchange bills also eased, with the Bank of England interbank trading October gold at 7 5625 pence, and Citibank trading at 39.6875 yuan. With the initial announcement unmoved, a few cents were added, calculated at 60.3 taels. Subsequently, there were fluctuations of a few cents, with Sumitomo buying December gold at 7.125 pence, and Fuchang, Yuanheng, Yuancheng, Yongyuan, Maoyong, etc., all selling into the rising market, causing prices to rebound and gradually rise by four or five taels, reaching 64.9 taels at 11:00. Forward Bank of England gold was traded at 7.75 pence, and then 6875 could be traded. Later, Fuchang and others sold, resulting in a small drop of one tael. Subsequently, there were rotations of about two taels. At noon, the market closed at 63.6 taels, with the announced price still calculated at 611.4 taels, with an early discount of around 51 taels and a noon discount of 47 or 48 taels.</p>
<p>After-Market Presents Downward Trend. The after-market opened at 63.9 taels, then at four taels, then rebounded by one tael. Around 2:30, it was calculated at 63 taels, then Hengxing and others sold. Later, hearing that the Indian exchange rate was slightly lower at 23 Anbang, people's spirits were lifted, and at 3:00 it was four taels and six or seven qian. Hua Bi sold November Bank of England gold at 7.625 pence, with each bank interbank trading at 7 pence and a half this month, and those entering the set-up sold, retreating by one tael. At 3:30, it was three taels and three qian. In an instant, Hengxing and others chased and raised the price, but the slips on the table were particularly scarce, jumping more than two taels in just over ten minutes, reaching 65.5 taels. At 4:00, it softened again, and then sellers became active, especially with McGary selling forward Bank of England gold at 7.625 pence, and HSBC selling October at 5625, November at 625. Professionals' minds were stirred, and the price rapidly retreated, plummeting three or four taels, suddenly closing at 61 taels at 4:30, a further decrease of 1.4 taels compared to the previous day. It continued to make small amounts, so the goods were only auctioned at 60.6 taels. The maximum price for the day was 65.5 taels, and the minimum price was 59.6 taels, a difference of 5.9 taels. The quoted price was a discount of just over 50 taels, with postings from 75 taels to 64 taels, water replenishment at 75 taels, and 72 taels in the afternoon. The early opening price for goods was 61.2 taels, the noon close was three taels and a half, and the afternoon was three taels and seven qian, closing at 60.6 taels.</p>

The Guangdong gang still had no large-scale entries or exits, merely balancing out.</p>

<p>Yesterday's HSBC postings showed no changes in foreign exchange rates. However, the overseas silver market has rebounded. There were no special changes in the European market, and the trend of silver prices is rising. As for the Shanghai market, various exchange rates continue to ease and decline, with slight gains and losses throughout the day, linked to the gold market. The front market initially rose after falling, but the after-market proved to be weak and declined, with a difference of six taels between high and low. Chinese speculators had deals, with over 200,000 pounds of Bank of England gold being purchased. Zhejiang Industrial, Li Dong, Asia Bi, Wheat Line, etc., all sold, with HSBC having the strongest selling interest, selling over 100,000 pounds alone. Gold companies occasionally sold tens of thousands of pounds, and Sumitomo Gold absorbed them. Various banks also traded five or six million pounds. Chinese businessmen mostly set up deals for strips. Various banks also traded over 100,000 yuan in US dollars, while Japanese yen had only small amounts of entry and exit. Banks only purchased and sold slightly through Mitsui. As a result, the prices compared to the previous day showed an increase of 125 for the Bank of England, an increase of 25 for the US dollar, and a decrease of 75 for the Japanese yen. People's minds are wavering, and the market situation seems to be deteriorating.</p>

<p>The downward trend in the yarn market is due to the sharp decline in American cotton three-product yarn, which greatly disappointed bulls. Therefore, the local market is sluggish. However, the bulls of a certain manufacturer have always held on tightly, so the decline in wood yarn has not been drastic. However, the general trend of the world cotton industry is in this weakness and decline, and domestic wars are chaotic, with bandits rampant in all directions, sales have been greatly hit, so the bottom yarn inventory is accumulating daily. If transactions continue to stagnate like this, the subsequent decline will not stop.</p>
<p>Retreating Trend in Human Bidding. The human bidding opening price in the front market followed the trend of external cotton and declined, with the situation quite weak, each falling by one or two taels. In the second and third sessions, some profit-takers made up for a slight increase, each rising by two or three qian. As a result, each fell by seven, eight, nine qian to one tael and one qian. The afternoon market atmosphere was still weak, but the decline in three-product yarn was very strong, rising by nearly one qian and falling by two or three qian in the distant market. The total transaction volume for the day was 18,500 bales. Rongxing bought 1,600 bales, Yuda 1,100 bales, Yongfeng 1,400 bales, Yuantai 700 bales, and the remainder 300 to 500 bales. Hengyi sold 1,850 bales, Zhenda 1,250 bales, Yichang 1,050 bales, Gongtai 800 bales, Shenchang 650 bales, Gengfeng 600 bales, and others 300 to 550 bales.

<p>Stagnation in Spot Sales. Spot yarn sales are sluggish. The total number of bales bought by various gangs throughout the day was 1,171, with 1,010 bales entered by colleagues. Market prices fell by five qian. Among the customer gangs, Sichuan entered 745 bales, Xuzhou 90 bales, inland 45 bales, Tianjin 85 bales, Hankou 45 bales, Yunnan 36 bales, and miscellaneous gangs 125 bales.</p>

<p>Sharp Decline in American Cotton··Great Disappointment for Bulls</p>
<p>The American cotton government report still reached 14,340,000 bales, a decrease of only 22,000 bales compared to the previous time, so cotton prices saw a sharp decline again, causing great disappointment for bulls in Shanghai. Retail buyers were quite alarmed. According to Japanese merchants, American cotton may continue to find new low prices. Spot cotton business has been cut off, and there is talk of cheap Indian cotton being mixed and sold, so there is no hope for the future of local cotton transactions. The harvest in Tongchong, Taicang, and other places is worse than in previous years, but Hubei is good, so a portion is being sold off vigorously. The cotton market is still difficult to stabilize under the decline of external cotton. However, the majority of people are holding on tightly due to the poor weather.</p>
<p>Han Bidding Falls by as Much as Four Qian. The opening price of Han bidding in the front market was quite weak. The majority of people's overnight purchases, seeing the sharp fall in American cotton, mostly turned from long to short. For a time, the situation was not good, each falling by four and a half qian. Later, manufacturers in Wuxi made up for it in large quantities, totaling more than 10,000 dan, slightly stabilizing the market. As a result, each fell by three and a half qian. The afternoon market atmosphere remained weak. Three-product cotton fell by one yuan and eight or nine jiao, and each month also fell by five fen. The total transaction volume for the day was 60,100 dan. Hengyi sold 6,900 dan, Taixing 3,400 dan, Shenchang 3,200 dan, Jinfeng 5,300 dan, Yuchang 3,400 dan, Tianchang 3,400 dan, and others 1,800 to 200. Hengde bought 10,900 dan, Yichang 3,000 dan, Yuanda 2,800 dan, Yongfeng 4,000 dan, and the remainder 1,200 to 2,500 dan. The closing prices of Han bidding are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the number of inland ships arriving at the source was moderate, and the traffic was relatively active. Although sales on this street were brisk, buyers unanimously demanded stricter quality, refusing to accept anything less than refined products. The arrival of Dongxin japonica rice was slightly more active, with prices slightly higher by half a yuan, opening at 17.5 yuan. Only goods from the downstream were available in the new Yangjian market, opening yesterday at 14.9 to 15.1 yuan. The arrival of new Kejian rice was very large, and sales were also smooth, with high-quality goods still opening at 14 yuan, and medium and lower grades down by 2 jiao. The market remained flat and sluggish. The Baiyuan market remained stable, due to the weak arrival of goods and smooth outbound traffic. Demand was very strong, and prices generally opened at 18.7 to 18.8 jiao.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: The arrival of river boats was still small. Sales on this street were average. High-quality broken japonica rice from the northern gang was still in short supply, so there was no standard price. A small amount of medium-grade japonica rice arrived, with prices rebounding slightly by a jiao or so. Dongxin japonica rice prices were slightly lower by 3 to 4 jiao, with market prices ranging from 17.5 to 17 yuan. Southern bang indica rice prices fluctuated. Although the sale of Bianyuan rice was active, the source of goods was dwindling. Jiangxi rice arrived successively, with prices slightly lower by 2 jiao.</p>

<p>A new batch of Huangqiao rice has arrived.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian rice continued to arrive from Jiangxi, and a small batch was also shipped from Huangqiao Town in Jiangbei. Xiang rice has been officially unbanned, and large quantities are expected to arrive soon, so the market is quite sluggish. Fortunately, the demand on this street is still strong, and the Ke gang also has the Qingdao gang purchasing Huji Baoliang rice, so the market has turned from sluggish to better. The Tongshi sold more than 200 bags of Hunan Baoliang rice, priced at 11.83 to 11.75 yuan, and 350 bags of Ji Jing rice, priced at 13.05 to 12.95 yuan. 1,800 bags of Jiangxi early Ji rice, priced at 13.6, 13, and 12.5 yuan. 200 bags of late Ji rice, priced at 16.1 to 15.9 jiao. 186 bags of Huangqiao rice, priced at 12.2 jiao. Except for Xiang rice, which was handled by Qingdao, all were handled by this street.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the wheat market remained flat and sluggish in both the morning and afternoon sessions. The quoted price of foreign wheat fell again by 3, 4, and 6 jiao. Some factories continued to gradually sell off their forward month contracts, so the overall sentiment was weak. However, the inland gang took advantage of this opportunity to buy in, so although the transaction volume was active, the decline was not as severe as the previous day. As a result, this month's price was slightly lower by 2 fen from the previous day, October's price was lower by 3 fen, November's price was lower by 2 fen, December's price was lower by 3 fen, and February's price was lower by 2 fen. The attitude of the factories in the current wheat market remains sluggish, because the sales of flour have not been active, so they remain conservative.

<p>Yesterday's flour market was generally in a fluctuating state in both the morning and afternoon sessions. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat was slightly lower, the crux of the market seemed to be still in the hands of the factories. According to the current situation, the main food supply is loosening due to the bumper harvest, and flour is a supplementary food for the people, so it must follow the trend and fall. However, the buying and selling of standards has a fixed method, and the factories cannot release goods, which loses the possibility of adjustment. Therefore, in fact, the large factories must release their goods before the market can follow the environment. No factory releases were seen throughout the day, and the inland areas absorbed some, with only a slight difference in price. As a result, this month's price was lower by 2.5 li, October's price remained unchanged, November's price was lower by 2.5 li, December's price was lower by 7.5 li, January's price was lower by 5 li, and February's price was lower by 7.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Sugar Market: Dutch Red Label Opens Lower <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegrams: The current price of Cuban raw sugar is still 1.15625, New York futures sugar September is 1.10, December price is 1.18, next year March is 1.29, May is 1.38, comparing the previous telegrams there are no changes. The current price of Java raw sugar is 8.75, futures sugar September is 8.6875, October is 8.50, November is 8.375, compared to the previous also lacks rises and falls. The Guild market set the price of Dutch sugar 24 coarse granulated white aged goods at 8 liang, medium granulated white at 7 liang 6 qian, finely ground granulated white at 8 liang, transactions were also scarce, the market was flat and sluggish. Taikoo B Mark truck sugar was priced at 8 liang 1 qian 5 fen, Nissin Sugar YT Mark 8 liang 0 qian 7 fen 5 li, YRO Mark 7 liang 9 qian 5 fen, transactions were few, N Mark was quoted at 8 liang 1 qian 5 fen and lacked buyers. In fact, the daily arrivals turned abundant, and the sales in various places were sluggish, the buying atmosphere was bleak, and the market was very weak. The price of domestic Wufu ice sugar opened at 200 boxes, the price was still the original 6 liang 7 qian, the market was still firm. Since the huge amount of Dutch red sugar arrived, the market atmosphere suddenly turned depressed. Bingchang opened 2,000 bags of No. 8 goods, priced at 6 liang 3 qian, and at the same time, Huaxin quoted 6 liang 4 qian for No. 10 goods, and 6 liang 6 qian, and there were no inquiries.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Sales Still Difficult to Progress <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market of foreign firms in this port still had difficulty progressing, because the price of Japanese silk in the European and American markets was very low, and although there were telegrams for Chinese silk, the price was still cheap. Chinese silk merchants' capital was not loose, and losses were too great, so all were watching and not moving forward. Yesterday, only 15 packs of top-grade Sichuan yellow factory silk from Mujiyang were opened, priced at 885 liang.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Large Tea Dealers in Luzhuang Slightly Active in American Sales <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Zhenmei tea from Luzhuang still showed a trend of rising and falling. Tianxiang and Yongxing and other firms continued to show strong interest in Wuyuan North Road tea and Tunxi core-drawn goods, and the selling prices did not rise or fall. Yesterday, the American firms in the Wuyuan Grand Company had already started handling the goods, but the selection was extremely strict, and the prices were very harsh. Most of the goods were sold in small quantities, and the remaining medium and low-grade goods, except for the Zhenmei item, which was slightly sold, the remaining 2 were all sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Piece Goods: Yuehua Velvet Soars <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The piece goods market continues to rise. The Yuehua velvet of Dong goods soared again yesterday, rising sharply by about 5 li. Zhongbing's Jilong Yang Guifei Zijinshan consistently sold at 2 qian, and Dabing's Fuhua Jilong White Peony already required 2 qian 0 li 2.5 hao. Black flower velvet Xiao Jilong also opened at 2 qian 9 fen 2.5 li, the speed of the increase is rare. The reason is that the inventory is empty and the Osaka fixed price is getting higher and higher, so although the price is soaring, there are many who open to buy. Zhigong Ni Zhigong satin is also quite excited, yesterday Moganshan Lieyan all rose 5 li, the first achievement has been sold at 3 qian 1 fen, this kind of five-piece Zhigong satin sold at this price is unprecedented. Light twill also rose 5 fen to 1 qian yesterday, lovely beauty miscellaneous colors opened at 5 liang 1 qian, Shuangdeli gray 4 liang 7 qian 5 fen, lovely ocean blue 4 liang 9 qian 5 fen, Sezigong this street has a very smooth sales path, Kong Yingwen's Ronghua Fugui flower style is better and has been sold at 2 qian 6 fen 5 hao, wool silk cloth is also in high demand, yesterday all rose 2 fen 5 hao</p>

<p>Blue serge and Huatene have been popular for a long time, and now the inventory is sparse and the demand has increased sharply, resulting in prices soaring. Yesterday, Ningfeng 1234 crossing the river banquet sold for 2 liang, Deji 1339 Dafacai for 2 liang 8 qian 5 fen, Baoduo 7630 Meideli 2 liang 4 qian 5 fen, Taihe Changsheng Le 2 liang 1 qian 5 fen, Meifa Baima 1 liang 9 qian 5 fen, Hongsheng for 2 liang 2 qian 5 fen, Tianxiang 999 sold 2 liang 8 qian 5 fen, 444 for 2 liang 1 qian. Half of the blue color in a box is only two or three bolts, and retail split blue must be mixed with other colors, otherwise each yard will be raised by 1 qian, and it is difficult to negotiate a deal.</p>

<p>26-foot black iron sheets have recently been frequently handled by Tianjin gangs. The future market is gradually becoming active, and the market is also becoming firmer. The current market is estimated at 10 liang 7 qian, which is 2 qian 5 fen higher than before. It is reported that the gangs in Niuzhuang, Yingkou, and Dalian have also been inquiring a lot recently, so the future of the market should be even more optimistic. As for 36-foot goods, because the Qingdao gang does not handle them, the market is quieter, so there is no change in the market price.</p>

<h3 id="e211">American Newly Created Automobile Super Service Station <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zhizheng</p>
<p>One-Stop System Benefits Car Owners, Comprehensive Preparations Reflect Motherly Care</p>
<p>Because the automobile industry is advancing rapidly and the various aspects related to automobiles are also developing rapidly, the most obvious is the automobile service station. This publication has already had a lot of discussion about automobile station services. Now the United States also has so-called "Super Service Station" organizations, and the content is becoming more scientific. Now, let's use two examples to illustrate this new product of automobiles.</p>
<p>The first successful Super Service Station was the Roland Automobile Company in Western Pennsylvania. Roland Company has two great buildings, one with five floors and one with three floors, occupying the center of the city and covering an area of ​​138,000 square feet. The company originally sold passenger cars. Buick, Mark, and Cadillac were all sold by him. Currently, he is shifting the focus from selling cars to Super Service Stations. He said in the advertisement that this Super Service Station is the largest and most complete in the world. In fact, it is well-deserved. Company Secretary Bairoko said that a Super Service Station can also be called "One-stop." What is a One-Stop? It means that no matter what kind of car comes, whether it is a minor problem or a major repair, whether it needs parts or manufacturing, everything can be handled here. There is no need to go to a second place to deal with it. Isn't it true that after "one-stop," you don't need to stop again?</p>
<p>The five-story building is now dedicated to selling cars, while the three-story building is dedicated to Super Service Stations. Although the work is clearly divided between the two buildings, every car that enters the car sales area must pass through the Super Service Station. The gate is on the left. Inside is the accounting and battery room. On the right is the office of the company's general manager. The Super Service Station is inside. The first item is a car wash machine, using extremely new-style machinery. The second item is a brake and lubrication testing machine. At the same time, tire and battery repair machines are also installed. The light in the room is exceptionally clear, and there is no need for lights for repairs. On the second floor, there is a car painting area. The repair shop covers an area of ​​about 9,600 square feet. On the door of the lubrication area, there is a slogan written in large characters: "Lubricate Your Car."</p>
<p>The Super Service Station only opened on May 3rd. That was the company's 25th anniversary. In the past 25 years, the company has actually become the largest company in Western Pennsylvania. Speaking of the company's history, it is also interesting. When it was opened in 1907, its position was not even half of what it is now. It was not until June 1912 that it bought some land. It was not until 1916 that two buildings were built. Two years later, the company's affairs developed, and the buildings were renovated. Since the success of the Super Service Station, business has become more and more wonderful. Everyone entrusts all their affairs to him because he has perfect equipment. He—the Super Service Station—is truly the mother of automobiles.</p>
<p>The second case is in California. The company's name is "Calideu." His Super Service Station is built very uniquely. The machines include car washing, lubrication, car testing, and light testing, etc. In addition, there are also restaurants, barbershops, art shops, etc. for car owners to enjoy. The owner of "Calideu" company said, "Now what car owners value most is not repair, but maintenance. The so-called maintenance includes car lubrication, car testing, and car types. Facts tell us that the repair cost for a car owner in the first year of buying a car is only one-third or one-quarter of the maintenance cost. After three years, the repair cost gradually increases. However, at that time, it has become an old car. Setting up a service station by the car seller is especially convenient for the car owner. The car seller understands the car owner's situation and still provides free maintenance for a certain period. What our company emphasizes is this point. Since the establishment of the Super Service Station, the results have been extremely satisfactory. We are working hard to move forward."</p>
<p>In short, the differences between a Super Service Station and an ordinary service station are roughly two points. First, a Super Service Station has a larger scope and more complete equipment. Second, a Super Service Station can handle all the affairs of customers. No matter how damaged it is, it can handle it all.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Studebaker New Style <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Automatic shifting. Free Wheeling is the latest invention for the Studebaker President and Commander eight-cylinder new cars. Not only does it enhance their already established smoothness and stability, but the car owner can use this device to shift gears at will at 40 to 50 miles per hour without ever using the clutch. No sound, extremely convenient. With this device, the car's mileage record is not enough to affect the engine because, as a result, the wear and tear on the engine, rear axle, and power transmission are all avoided, and the consumption of gasoline and oil is greatly reduced. It is said that the Hengmao Automobile Company has already shipped these new cars and displayed them at No. 23 McTyeire Road, where the company's new sample room welcomes people from all walks of life to visit and appreciate them.

<p>Well organized, so it is also called the "One-Stop" system. Since the automotive industry has had the Super Service Station organization, everyone entrusts their cars to them to save time. They maintain the cars with the heart of a loving mother caring for her children. They complement each other, and the demand for setting up super service stations has gradually spread throughout the United States. (September 7th, at Jiaotong University)</p>

<h3 id="e213">Automobiles and the Northwest (Part 1) <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Yuan</p>
<p>The Northwest region, from Suiyuan extending northwest, connecting Mongolia, southwest and the three provinces of Xin, Gan, and Shaanxi, occupies tens of thousands of miles. It is a desolate area, sparsely populated, but rich in resources and treasures, a truly God-given region. This often arouses the covetousness of foreigners, who constantly think of seizing it. Since Red Russia's invasion of Mongolia, the situation on the frontier has become increasingly urgent. The sudden pressure has stirred the nation's sense of fear. Recently, private individuals or groups have even organized Northwest travel groups, but due to inconvenient transportation and bandits everywhere, government offices often exaggerate the danger and do not take responsibility for safety. This has led those with lofty aspirations for travel to go no further than Baotou, near the tomb of Wang Zhaojun (in Suiyuan city, there is the tomb of Wang Zhaojun, called Mingfei Mound). As for the fertile fields of Wuyuan, the area of the Hetao pastures, and the living conditions of the Mongolian banners and border people, all are inaccessible due to traffic congestion, making it impossible to set foot among them, to see with one's own eyes, and to achieve the merit of on-the-spot investigation. However, private groups are actually concerned about the desert. Their ambition and courage are enough to make people admire and be amazed. Moreover, since then, the advocacy for managing the Northwest has suddenly and unexpectedly become loud again in the dust of the old capital. Although actual visits may not be scheduled, this promotion is enough to show that our people have never forgotten the Northwest for a single day. It also prompts the government to pay attention to it. What is regrettable is that private groups are ultimately too weak, only able to run around and call for support for a while. Their backing still needs a strong and powerful government. However, today's government, due to the many difficulties of the current situation and the shortage of financial resources, still finds it difficult to stop internal construction. How can it have the spare energy to take care of other things? In the end, this rich and fertile land will never be developed and will be abandoned, giving foreigners a chance to covet it, while patriotic people in the country have no strategy to ask about it. Speaking of this, one cannot help but sigh. It is recently heard that Chairman Li Hanchu is quite able to invigorate those with the ambition to manage it. Recently, he established a bureau in Atao Banner (west of Wuyuan) to govern the area, and the director, Gao Ziqian, is an old acquaintance of mine and is quite capable. In the future, he will manage and build in the desolate deserts and lush forests, establishing a glorious and extraordinary achievement and adding an unparalleled glory to the Republic of China. Then, the future of the Northwest can be hoped for.</p>
<p>The only policy for managing the Northwest is to resettle people there as soon as governance is established. With the people moving in, the border will be secured. On one hand, encourage cultivation and development of mineral resources. On the other hand, promote animal husbandry and expand the sale of fur. If these are successful, then after a year, the products and output of the Northwest will definitely increase, and the income of the Northwest will be more than enough to support the people of the Northwest. When the country looks west, there will be no financial difficulties to worry about. However, the policy of resettlement places the greatest emphasis on transportation. Without adequate transportation, banditry cannot be eliminated. If the bandits are not suppressed, the people will not dare to come. Even if they come, they cannot settle down. If they are not at peace, they cannot stay long. Coming today and leaving tomorrow, how is that different from not resettling at all? There are various designs for transportation, but the most important thing to implement first is the safety and convenience of travelers and the railway industry. However, in the vast wilderness, the planning of the route cannot be done in a short time, and the financial resources are especially beyond the reach of today's government. Even if the Ping-Sui Railway is used to extend to Dingkou or Ningxia, although it is no more than a thousand miles long, the cost of rails and locomotives is not light. Thinking and planning in silence, this is not an easy task. Moreover, with the national treasury so empty, how can it be easy to talk about? The next best thing is the automobile. The capital for automobiles is lighter, and road construction is easier. The other conditions are also quite simple. Therefore, according to my ideal, transportation in the Northwest must first start with automobiles, so that things will be easier to do and easier to see success. If a railway must be planned, it is a fundamental plan, but in the end, it will be necessary to borrow foreign debt.</p>
<p>In the past, when Feng Huanzhang was the Director-General of Northwest Border Defense, he stationed troops in Baotou (the westernmost point of the Ping-Sui Railway, which is also very interested in planning for Northwest transportation. His original plan was to build a trunk line along the Houtao to Dingkou, and then cross the Hetao to Ningxia to form a second trunk line. From these two trunk lines, several branch lines would then be extended to places such as Wuceng, Linhe, and Kushui Lake. After the branch lines were successful, several short lines would then be formed to the important tribes in Inner Mongolia, still converging on the two trunk lines. The plan was not without grandeur, and troops had already been moved to start construction. Although the operation was arduous, the project was completed for the most part in a few months. The determination cannot be said to be without the greatest perseverance. Who knew that financial resources would be strained and the country would have many affairs? Before it could be completed, Feng had left the country. When the Battle of Nankou was lost and the entire army retreated west, all the automobiles were used to transport long-distance military supplies. After driving west, they never returned. The automobile road, which had been painstakingly built for several months with the blood and sweat of countless soldiers, was also completely trampled by the wheels and hooves of the retreating army. In recent years, although the Suiyuan authorities have also made plans, during the military period, local finances are even more difficult, and there is still much that cannot be done in administrative construction. It is even more impossible to talk about transportation in the wilderness. Since the officials are powerless, the merchants do not come forward. The people are dissatisfied, and bandits swarm together. Murder and robbery are heard every day. Travelers are especially wary, and the desolation of the Northwest may be even worse than in those years. This has made the excellent agricultural and animal husbandry fields and the rich land of heaven and earth allow foreigners to covet and seize it, and compete to implement their aggressive ambitions. The Book says, "A common man is not guilty, but he is guilty for possessing treasure." The fierce neighbors are watching intently, which is enough to make the troubled people of the country feel anxious. If there is still no overall and concrete plan within a few years, I am afraid that the border troubles in the Northwest will be a painful thing to say.</p>
<p>The transportation that the Northwest already has relies only on the Ping-Sui Railway, which goes west to Baotou. From Baotou to the west and south, the navigation of the Houtao can still be used. As for the trend, the Northwest has no other means except for the labor of cattle and horses. When sailing upstream against the wind, it takes more than twenty days to reach Dingkou from Baotou. As for the labor of cattle and horses, it is even more unreliable. When the weather is good and there is no wind or rain, a horse cannot travel more than a hundred miles a day. Cattle can only travel about sixty miles. Although automobiles can travel five hundred miles a day, long-distance wind and snow and light rain are not harmful. Comparing the two, the distance an automobile travels in a day can be compared to the distance a horse or cattle travels in one to five or ten, and it can be compared to a boat in one to fifteen. There is already such a benefit in terms of time, and there are also equal benefits in terms of economy. Once transportation is convenient, everything in the area becomes convenient. The residents and merchants of the interior will come without being invited. How can the Northwest's businesses be limited? Although this is close to ideal, it can be put into practice, how can it not be so? From this, we know that automobiles are not only of considerable value in the future development of the Northwest, but also have the ability to connect the merchants and travelers who travel to and from Shaanxi and Suiyuan in the present.</p>
<p>Automobiles occupy a considerable position in Northwest transportation. However, those who engage in this business are merchants who take profit as their aim, and their capital is at stake. Who would be willing to waste it? At a time when banditry has not been quelled and there are thorns and weeds along the way, if the government does not have considerable measures to provide them with effective protection, I am afraid that merchants will not be able to invest without worry. Therefore, transportation in the Northwest must first start with bandit suppression. If the bandits are eliminated, transportation will be unimpeded, merchants and people can be without fear, and the Northwest can be greatly developed. Those who operate automobiles will also be eager to invest. In my opinion, now is the time for the government to do its best to suppress bandits, while dividing troops to repair roads, planning resettlement, and raising several hundred thousand yuan to organize a convenient transportation agency. Allow merchants to invest and cooperate, and the government is in a supervisory position. Merchants should get their share of the profits, and the government should take it to maintain the roads. If we plan like this, it may be sustainable. Merchants will also have no way to hoard and speculate to exploit travelers. Travelers will praise the convenience, and officials and merchants will have no worries about capital. Transportation may be expected to develop.</p>

The prosperity of the new city has begun. In addition, the development of the new city area in the eastern suburbs is entrusted to the new life of Anqing City. The development of the new city area must be linked to the old city. The planned two roads of the Sida Station are the backing for the implementation of this plan. The Sida Road is 85 feet long and 38 feet wide. The six projects including roadbed, curb stone, water pipe, road surface, moat culvert, and sidewalk require 3,000 yuan and 6 yuan. The station road is 50 feet long and 38 feet wide. The six projects including roadbed, curb stone, water pipe, road surface, moat culvert, and sidewalk require 2,604 yuan and 25 cents. The cost is slightly higher than Sida.</p>
<p>Wuhu City Repairs the North Road and Widens the Streets. In Wuhu City, the section from Tiefosi to the Customs Wharf is extremely narrow. The City Engineering Bureau is now designing and building it. From the power company to the Customs Wharf, including North Road and the original Zhongjiang Road, it is 1,500 meters long. The project is divided into two sections. The first section starts in front of Tiefosi and ends in front of Xingwuli, with a total of 2,342 English squares of earth filling. The second section starts at the Shandong Road intersection and ends in front of the Hengshengli of the original Zhongjiang Road, with a total of 4,892 English squares of earth filling. The earth filling project is transported by light rail. All light rail tracks, sleepers, iron nails, and earth-carrying iron cars are supplied by the bureau, but the track laying work is borne by the contractor. In addition, the roads in the Erjie area are the main transportation routes in Wuhu City, but the roads are narrow and the ditches are silted up, so they should be widened and dredged separately to revitalize road administration. It is stipulated that the width of the two streets is 50 English feet, and the middle lane is 30 English feet. The sidewalks on both sides are each 16 English feet wide. The most important thing in municipal facilities is roads. Not only is it related to the neatness of the city, but it is also related to the progress of commerce. Therefore, the narrow Erjie will be widened and dredged.</p>
<p>Bengbu City Revises the Method of Widening Streets. Bengbu City's ban on the construction of houses by citizens has always been handled in accordance with the building rules approved by the Public Security Bureau. Now that the original rules are not perfect, according to the provisions of the City Organization Law, referring to the Nanjing City's method of widening streets, and taking into account the situation of Bengbu City, the Engineering Bureau has formulated eight articles of temporary regulations on widening streets and retreating houses. It has been approved and promulgated by the Municipal Preparatory Office and stipulates six types of road widths, with the widest being 30 meters and the narrowest being 7 meters. Complementing the original old rules, it not only improves the streets but also regulates road administration, and is a key plan for developing the new city.</p>
