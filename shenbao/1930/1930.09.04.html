<p>時評</p>
<h3>南美之革命潮流</h3>
<p>美洲中之墨西哥。素以不時革命聞於世。然至近時以來已漸安定。至於南美各國。地雖不甚大。國雖不甚强。而國内之平安久不聞有革命之警報。迨自近日。前時以革命相傅。繼續而起者且不止一國。秘魯之革命爲時無幾。而阿眞廷之政潮。即接踵而至陸長已辭職。總統已决定下野。是與革命無異也。古語有云銅山西崩。洛鍾東響。可知萬事萬物。皆有相感之理。况處於同洲之國家乎。</p>
<p>以細微之端言之。一國有一國之政治。一國有一國之歷史與習慣其間各不相同然以大端言之所謂人類者。不甚相遠。南美各國多係臘丁民族、其相近也。尤甚於民族之不相同者故一國有此利弊他國亦復相同一國因利弊之故而生風潮他國亦必牽連而發生。遲速或有相異。方式或有相異。而其所以發生之原則同也。何也。所謂潮流。必至蔓衍。其相近相類者。必將波及之也。是故古有善鄰之義。而不以鄰之厚君之薄爲戒。若專望鄰國之亂以爲己利。此乃淺近無識之流。終亦有禍及於己之一日也。</p>

<h3>雷穆敎授來華之任務</h3>
<p>對於新中國時代之經濟有新貢獻</p>
<p>搭俄羅斯皇后號來華明日可抵埠</p>
<p>（中外社國際消息）年來外人研究東方問題者關於經濟商業方面、特加注意、如亞丹斯Adans之研究吾國鐵路會計、約翰生Johson之攷察運輸問題而吾政府聘請國外專家者、亦屬見不鮮、如前淸時精琦惠斯林二氏之聘請近今凱末爾設計委員會之設立、</p>
<p>客卿中除亞丹斯外、對於吾國學術界有相當之貢獻、莫如雷穆Renor敎授敎授所諸書如中國國際贸易經濟講義等、於吾國經濟界中均有莫大之影響、此次來華、除研究中國國際金融與經濟外同時考察吾國各大商埠、是行係受紐約社會科學研究所之委託、與波金司學院之顧問委員會（華盛頓）共同工作、計自民國十七年夏、社會學研究所通過其提議、迄今業已兩載矣、</p>
<p>去歲在日本西京之太平洋國立會議對於列强在華投資之問題佔節目中之重要地位當時關於斯類之各方報告包括如下、</p>
<p>外國在華投資劉大鈞</p>
<p>英國在華投資英倫國際時事學會中之委員會</p>
<p>日本在華投資汪田崛理</p>
<p>法德在華投資哀理司（蜜西千大學敎授）</p>
<p>美國在華投資雷穆敎授</p>
<p>比較各種列强在華投資數目、互有出入故改正是項差異、亦爲將來重要之問題、結果則列强在華投資之總數、必有所準繩焉、總數中重要部分、即包括國府之外債此問題去年凱末爾設計委員注意及之而凱敎授調查之結果對於國府外債之總數、較爲明確、</p>
<p>雷敎授歷來研究之所得、謂國外商店之直接在華投資遠逾國府之外債其數目或有數倍之鉅、是種直接投資之計算、極爲困難、故國外直接投資與列强在華投資、結果之重要、甚爲明顯矣又國外在華投資之影響及吾國民之經濟政治社會生活、亦爲此次研究之要點、而對於條約口岸制度與治外法權下之吾國經濟制度、亦莫不注意之、</p>
<p>又南洋一帶華僑對本國之投資數目、亦爲該敎授研究之一題、惜匯兌制度簡陋、調查無由着手、而滬上各銀行亦不肯以内部情形示人、聞滬西國立曁南大學有南洋美洲文化事業部之設立主持者深洞僑情、或能助一臂之力也、</p>

<p>球藝評論駱洪勝對陸漢俊駱君爲久戰老將、出席遠東選手、善守精抽、陸君則爲年少英俊勇敢善戰、雖攻守得宜、究覺經騐薄弱以致失敗鄧國富爲新出人才、然勤於練習、抽球得力、馬雖久歷戰場、精於守球、而均難以應付各至失敗、盧促球爲出席遠東選手、戰敗日本森田者、技術精良、善反攻見機注射、孫君雖積極抵禦、終以乏暇爭顧而敗北黄安邦爲新進各將之一、精抽球陸愼桐遠近擊皆優、技術高人一等觀衆精彩較多、以三對一勝黄、黄祥發爲二次出席遠東代表、在賽員中資格最老、守球最佳、朱雖善抽善守、終覺難支、用以抽球、雖得力非凡、有時黄君不能應付、然朱君常致自殺、黄君較穏、所以勝利屬黄君、</p>

<h3>日本三大網球錦標賽觀戰紀</h3>
<p>全日本學生……幼級……女子三種</p>
<p>獎勵有方|人才輩出|我國勉諸</p>
<p>（東京通訉）日本網球協會主辦之三大錦標賽自八月二十日至二十七日在甲子園先後舉行、凡學生界健將均相率與賽爭榮、而新進能手、亦踴躍報名藉求登龍門之機會除女子賽外、其報名人數之多凌駕歐美、蓋學生賽單打計有百二十八名雙打有三十餘組、幼級單打亦有八十餘名、雙打計凡三十組、女子單打計十六人、雙打僅有八人組與我國廖寂之網球界比較洵有霄壤之感且八日間於酷暑炎陽下連續自上午九時開賽、選手咸持始終不怠之精神、其意氣之熾盛至堪佩服無怪島國每年產生網球新人、霸稱東亞雄飛海外、究其原因不外努力普及、主持者奬勵有方、始克臻此假使我國斯技之關心人士、尚不抬頭猛醒、則下屆遠運會網球錦標恐絕無染指之希望矣、茲將重要比賽之觀戰藝評、彙誌如左、</p>
<h3>（一）全日本學生網球錦標</h3>
<p>單打</p>
<p>第六週賽</p>
<p>佐藤（早大）6|1、7|5、3|6、（神戶商大）</p>
<p>山田（慶應）9|76|0棄權吉原（東京帝大）</p>
<p>志村（慶應）6|2、6|0、6|0布井（神戶商大）</p>
<p>伊藤（甲南）1|6、6|4、6|4、6|2川地（早大）</p>
<p>複賽</p>
<p>佐藤2|6、0|6、6|3、6|3、6|0山田</p>
<p>志村2|6、6|3、6|3、8|6伊藤</p>
<p>决賽</p>
<p>佐藤7|5、6|1、3|6、7|5志村</p>
<p>雙打</p>
<p>山岸志村（慶應）3|6、6|4、6|3、6|1布井桑原（神戶商大）</p>
<p>山地佐藤（早大）3|6、6|3、6|3、6|3堀越　原（開西學院）</p>
<p>决賽</p>
<p>川地佐藤7|5、4|6、6|3、3|6、6|4山岸志村</p>
<h3>（二）全日本幼級網球錦標</h3>
<p>單打决賽</p>
<p>藤倉次郎（明治）2|7、6|1、0|6、7|5平井（慶應）</p>
<p>雙打决賽</p>
<p>伊藤楠本（甲南）2|6、6|2、7|5、7|5藤倉中谷（明治）</p>
<h3>（三）全日本女子網球錦標</h3>
<p>單打</p>
<p>小林（名古屋）6|2、6|3户田（關西）</p>
<p>雙打</p>
<p>户田增田（關西）6|1、8|6小林羽山（名古屋甲南）</p>
<h3>（四）觀戰感想球藝批評</h3>
<p>女子户田女士曾代表日本出席第六届遠運會、雖屬老巧惟鬥志已無往年之威風且小林乃後起之秀球藝猛進、其拍法幾若男子、在第九届遠運會克服我國李氏兩花毫不費力、現爲日本女界第一人、故其勝利早爲意中事、惟雙打因與羽山猝爾相拉、合作不佳致受挫於考巧之户田增田組、</p>
<p>幼級參加資格因以未満十九歲者爲標準、故中學選手、亦不得不與新進大學及高等學校之英俊會戰、故曾訪滬遠征之小藤倉、大有無人敵之槪、惟决賽時對手之平井、球藝絕不示弱、首盤打得精彩異常實力伯仲二盤平井欠缺鎭定、拍攻多失、三盤乘藤倉輕驕反襲見功、使藤倉白吃鴨蛋、因此氣壯於最後第四盤、你來我往、難分高、下曾一度以五比四佔先、頗形有利、不幸操勝過急、竟錯失閭鍵之一分、藤倉努力防戰忙命攔殺、卒以三比一、得錦標（未完）</p>

<h3>巡捕李慶甫之媳婦暴死可疑</h3>
<p>捕房接得匿名函</p>
<p>派包探秘密調查</p>
<p>認全家均有嫌疑</p>
<p>昨日解法院審訊</p>
<p>皖人李慶甫、年届知命、其在工部局充任巡捕、迄已十三年、現奉派於戈登路捕房服務、故家屬亦住戈登路六百六十六號門牌、李妻陳氏、年已四十有七、長子玉龍、二十五歲次子玉崑（又名玉芳）、二十一歲、皆服務公共汽車公司、一充二百二十號賣票、一充二十二號開車、玉龍業於前年三月間與張姓女結婚、張女亦爲皖籍、長玉龍一歲、不特夫婦感情和洽、而與翁姑等亦甚輯睦家庭間怡怡如也、</p>
<p>患急痧暴死不意上月二十七夜、張氏突患急痧、醫治不及、至次日午前四時殨命、經李慶甫與玉龍向閘北大統路張萬盛棺材店購備衣棺、當日下午成殮、柩厝閘北揚州會館、事已寢矣、</p>
<p>鄰居起疑心乃鄰居之人因張氏暴卒、不明致死原因、於是紛紛揣測、人言嘖嘖、謂被家長謀斃、好事者遂根據此項流言、書寫匿名信、分致該管戈登路捕房、曁特區地方法院、</p>
<p>一家均被捕　捕頭以外間旣有此傅言、則空穴來風不爲無因、特派探目邵景範秘密調查、邵探目偵查結果、認李氏全家實居嫌疑地位、乃將李慶甫夫婦與其兩子一併逮捕、</p>
<p>捕房之主張　昨解特區地方法院、由吳廷琪推事開第二法庭提審、捕房律師王耀堂稱、捕房旣獲匿名信、謂李張氏係被家屬謀斃、特派探員調查後、將一千人逮捕、詰問據李慶甫在捕房供渠之媳於二十七晚間八時半得病、次晨四時身死、惟據與李爲鄰之某婦稱、彼於二十七夜十一時、猶見李張氏健在、此中頗屬可疑、應請函致閘北官廳、將該棺柩移至斐倫路騐屍所、以便檢騐、至李慶甫等現暫不以任何罪刑起訴、惟請准將繼續覊押俟將屍體騐明後、再行定奪云云、</p>
<p>血跡與繩痕繼傅張萬盛棺店士工訊據證稱上月二十八日上午、李慶甫來店、購就棺木、並雇我赴其家帮同成殮、當與吳根發等同往、見所殮爲一女屍、其内衣已經穿就、我等祇爲穿外衣而已、惟是時死者口内流血、並察其臂間現靑紅色頸部似有繩索痕跡云云、</p>
<p>嚴斥駡不休又據李家隔壁六六五號屋内居婦包吳氏到庭證稱、上月二十七日午後五六時間、我在門前衖中晚膳、見李全家皆在門首同用晚餐、時死者因將冷飯與熱飯攙雜、被其姑李陳氏嚴斥、駡之不休、我向勸解、反遭譏誚、</p>
<p>出喪趨小路我飯後仍赴紗廠做夜工、至十一時放工歸家見死者在衖中自來水畔浣衣、當時聞人言、李陳氏曾將死者毆打、次晨六時見李陳氏携一包裏出外、詢以何往、則稱赴鄕、旋忽得知李張氏已於天未黎明身死、午後出喪、勿循正途大路、而從荒地趨小路、舁柩往閘北、種種情節皆有可疑云云、</p>
<p>被告請交保　質之李慶甫供稱、我於是晚十一時落差回家、據妻言媳患急痧、我即出外雇到挑痧者、爲媳挑痧、不料至次日上午四時遂死、我當投戈登路捕房報告云云、其餘李陳氏及其兩子均堅稱張氏實係急痧致死、並延律師請求將李父子三人交保、因一家被捕遺有小孩數口、無人照料也、</p>
<p>還押候再訊　而捕房律師則反對交保、並聲明李玉崑自張氏身死之次日、即向公共汽車公司請假、而李慶甫當時投捕房報告、係云其弟病斃、並未言及死者乃其媳、故彼顯屬情虚云云、吳推事嗣論李慶甫等男婦四名口分别押候再核、</p>

<h3>袁觀瀾先生軼事</h3>
<p>— 硯生</p>
<p>袁觀瀾先生爲吾國敎育界之泰斗。其敎育事業。及經營地方公益之成績。固已有口皆碑。無庸贅述矣。其軼事。則余嘗聞之鄰人周君。周蓋龍門師範畢業生。觀瀾先生門下士也。周君之言曰。某年値八月丁祭。袁先生衣冠趨孔廟。天尙未明也。由龍門師範往。有僻徑。其時多浪氓。。半路攫人衣服錢物。先生坦然出此路。迎面一人來。在星光下。其人已能認識先生。舉手執先生。手開口曰袁先生。今天往那裏去。穿了這樣整齊的衣冠。先生曰往聖廟裏去其人曰。原來今天要祭孔夫子。但是袁先生你前月向我借的五塊洋錢。今天也該還我了。先生乃回言曰。是的是的。我倒忘記了言。時向身邊摸出兩元與之。並言今天只有兩元。下回再說罷。其人曰也好也好。遂讓先生過去。事後先生以語友人。友人笑曰。今天這個流氓。還是看孔夫子面上。不然。這一件外套子。恐怕要被他借去咧。其實袁先生雖貧無儲蓄。常能周人之急。在彼輩流氓。亦未始不知。故所求不大也。聞親友中有待先生舉火者數家。是以先生自身儉樸逹極點。而終歲常拮据云。</p>
<h3>記洞庭山王氏傳家之寶</h3>
<p>— 覺迷</p>
<p>洞庭山望族當首數王氏蓋洞庭山各士族以王氏居之最久。而自宋以來。代有傅人。即如前明名臣王鏊即洞庭山人也。王鏊字家溪。卒謚文恪。當文恪在朝時。則有上朝艱一幅。告歸之後。則有壑舟圖一幅。身殁之後。又有五同圖一幅。此三圖者實今日洞庭山王氏傅家之寶也上朝圖。繪文恪上朝時情景。所繪者。上爲宮殿。下爲文恪。文恪方朝衣朝冠。執笏上朝故於文恪。但繪其背。而古大臣雍雍穆穆之風度則可於其背影得之。壑舟圖。繪文恪於告歸後泛舟於山壑情景。蓋文恪告歸之後優游山壑之間時或泛舟壑中。遂爲文恪繪爲壑舟圖。洎乎文恪殁後。數與文恪同時。同其科第。同其官秩。同其爵位。同其亮節。同其謚法者。厥有五人遂繪文恪等五人爲五同圖。至此三圖。一爲立軸。一爲册頁。一爲手卷。其上朝五同二圖。俱無欵識。而壑舟圖則出前明第一畫家沈啓南手筆。此三。圖明淸兩朝名公鉅卿。與夫大詩文家。大詞章家。所題詩詞䟦語。各至七八十家。蓋明淸兩朝大家。網羅無遺矣。淸末相臣陸鳳石潤庠。實爲王氏宅相。故壑舟圖題䟦。即以鳳石一䟦殿焉。蓋鳳石於貴後。親至王氏觀得其圖而題之者當時鳳石且以得觀此圖。引爲畢生眼福。至倩印人特刻鳳石眼福四字印章。鈐其䟦後。是又可知此圖之名貴矣今此三圖分藏王氏各房。不肯輕易示人故即文恪裔孫。不易寓目。余友王君述珊蓋爲文恪裔孫。亦謂生平實祇觀得上朝壑舟兩圖。猶未見五同一圖。王氏於每歲春日例有祀典。即於洞庭山祠堂舉行之裔孫之至者。各自簽名簿上。而此簽名簿則自元明以來。保存至今。未有缺失。積至數十百本。王氏亦視爲傅家之寶云。</p>
<h3>「蝶酣花醉」片中的一叚求婚</h3>
<p>— 周中璜</p>
<p>好萊鳱中一對最年輕而最受人歡迎的銀幕上的情侶。最近又被選爲電影皇后和電影皇帝了。伊倆眞是天生的一對佳耦。你看幾次在銀幕上的接吻和擁抱。總是十二分懇切和認眞的。因此一般觀衆。個個爲之傾倒而狂醉。熱愛着觀看他倆的影片。記得珍妮與却雷在（血淚痕Lucky　Star)片中有一節小溪試浴的艷事。當時却雷爲珍妮解上内衣。準備小浴。後來却雷知道伊是十八歲的處女。便趕緊替伊緊緊地扣上了衣鈕。默默然的去了。這一叚表演。增加了觀衆熱烈的贊美。可是這不過是銀幕上的有演。絕對不是從雙方内心流露出來的。最近美國電影雜誌。記載却雷在（蝶酣花醉）Sunny　Side　Up片中有演求婚一幕的深情使觀衆感覺到他的隠衷。的確。却雷把整個的心。借着銀幕上的求婚。向仍妮作最深刻的内心表現。他在（蝶酣花醉）中不僅爲劇中人求婚。實爲着自己求婚當他靜默默地替珍妮在珍邊套上了婚戒。他是流露着多少深情啊。他内心充満着希望。希望珍妮能諒解而允許他的要求。可憐這時却雷雖然在銀幕上表演。但他的心眞是焦燒着呢。在珍妮未嘗不明白他借着銀幕發揮自己的衷曲。但伊只有在内心暗笑吧了。愛觀電影的諸位。你們也知道他倆的情史中。也有一段可歌可泣的事蹟。現在這中蹟已成了過去了。可是他深情的求婚。——那新皇帝向新皇后求婚的影像。再留給在（蝶酣花醉）的片中。這一本如眞如幻的影劇。已公映於南京大戲院。</p>

<h3>東京的麻雀熱</h3>
<p>— 艾艾自日本寄</p>
<p>麻雀在日本。眞是盛極一時。别的府縣地方且不說。單是東京巿。現有麻雀俱樂部一千一百多所。彩色的繪着美婦人頭面的門燈鮮艷奪目的旗幟。金光閃爍的招牌。幾乎在每一條街上。總有這麽幾個麻雀俱樂部接觸到人們的眼簾。</p>
<p>在電車中在公園裡。在影戲塲的銀幕之上。在咖啡店的牆壁之間。我們隨時多可以看到麻雀俱樂部的廣告。（太陽像火樣的燃燒着。諸君。你們將怎樣的去消遣這溽暑的長晝呢。我們的屋子。像深秋一樣的淸凉。我們有光潔精細的如同象牙所彫刻的麻雀。我們有親切勉强（殷勤之意）的侍女。諸君來吧。來鬥牌吧。鬥牌是最高尙而又趣味豐富的娛樂呀。</p>
<p>每逢星期日。或平日的五時以後。每一個俱樂部。總是擠得満満的。華燈初上。紙醉金迷。公務員商人學生他們個個都喜歡弄這個玩意兒。好像終日疲勞。非來這麽一個四圈或八圈。精神不能恢復似的。每一俱樂部。他們差不多都有幾個長期的固定的老客。人有一位大吳服店（即綢緞店）的經理先生。每天下午三點鐘之後。無論發風落雨。俱樂部是不可不去的。據他的書記說。自從今年二月起到於今。他的東家没有間斷過一天不摸牌。鼎鼎大名的文學家菊池寛。他更是此中健將。當一張牌摸到他的手裡。他可以不必審視。便知道是九條還是八筒。他這個技巧。傅爲一時的佳話。很多的日本人都嘖嘖稱羨。非常地嘆服</p>
<p>近來書店的老板。更推波助瀾出版了很多的研究麻雀的書籍。如麻雀入門。麻雀秘訣。科學的麻雀竸技法。麻雀年鑑。麻雀指南麻雀春秋等。眞是琳琅満目。種類繁多。小小博奕之道。日本人也這般下研究功夫。最近的將。來他們的技術。一定靑出於藍呢。</p>
<p>日本人义麻雀。並不賭金錢的輸赢。完全是游戲性質俱樂部對於义麻雀的客人。每四圈收牌金六十錢。最輸的出三十錢。次輸的出二十錢。又次輸的出十錢。勝的人無須破費。要是牌友不足法定人數。俱樂部的侍女可以補充。俱樂部的侍女。伊們有三種任務。一招徠客人。二作牌客不足時之補充者。三不懂得鬥牌的人的義務敎員。每一個俱樂部裡。雇了這些妖艷的侍女。他們的鬥庭。是永遠不會冷落的。因爲一部份顧客。雖没有竹（竹林）的嗜好。却禁不住肉的誘惑呢。</p>
<h3>歐游通訊（七十二）</h3>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>游梵爾賽宮（七）Versailles</p>
<p>那眞是有點沉重了暴雨狂風席捲而來。満天都是黑的。嚴重的没有一點兒一點兒光明那暴雨浸透了我們的身體那黑雲壓在我們的靈魂上這眞是有點嚴重了很長久很長久。風雨還是不息。好像一直要反我們帶進地獄裏去。我瞧着墨黑的天我等候着那眞是長久。風雨終竟是息了。黑雲也退一些了。一線微光透入綠叢裏來了。同時一股寒氣。和自己身上一股混氣也來了。皮膚上。毛孔裏怪難受的。林間的鳥兒也慢慢地呌了。於是我們將船中的積水略略傾出。仍舊坐在裏面划回去。韻士的頭上雨浸透他本來熨捲的頭髮。直向面龐垂下只是沾着她的眼皮。。掠上去又下來了還有許多游者也自行打開了船浮於中流。我終是瞧着他們的那些發狂的面目。</p>
<p>「我們雖然備嘗艱苦而雅饒奇趣。」陳人浩君悠然地說。</p>
<p>是的。天朗氣淸的梵爾賽固然不差。暴風雨而游梵爾賽更是我們的一種得意。或者竟是傑作。在眞的懂得人生。要澈底走支人間趣味底裏面去的人。就應該在這暴風雨裏面黑暗裏面去招趣味。甚至罪惡裏醜陋裏。因爲這些裏面有更深的詩意。更奥藴而激動的美。一輩普通的人專以山明水秀爲美的。專以平面的行事爲善的。這是並没有眞的懂得人生更没有味到間深遠的意義上去的人。做人的目的不在做父親的一個純良的好兒子。豐衣足食也决不能満足你的理想。而在於各種更深的意義上去追求人間的趣味。所以德國的樂聖貝多芬就歡喜將暴雨狂風那般的音調作成樂譜創造出激動奮發苦悶的表情。法國詩人鮑特萊爾C.　Bendelaie更將淫猥的性慾的事實赤裸裸毫無顧忌地描冩出來。讚美那罪和惡。近代大彫刻羅丹ＡＲodin喜歡贊美醜的。他的大作有不少被庸衆看爲醜陋的淫惡的東西。我們走進羅丹美術館在中間一室正中置着一座大作品就是（接吻。）這是一男一女裸體緊緊擁抱的姿勢。從各方面着來没有一處的肉不在那裏顫動。這也是毫無顧忌表現性慾的東西。還有一座雕。刻陳列在樓上。題名（LadelleCasquettiere)的。是一個裸體的老婆子。撑着手俯首看着自己的身體。雞皮瘦骨。是十分醜陋的。他是要在普通以爲醜陋中。認識一種頽廢的快感。或者毒的甘味來。</p>

<h3>外匯似稍趨緊</h3>
<p>昨匯豐掛牌、各匯仍未動、惟英倫條銀見長、美銀未更、至於滬埠銀行内盤先令等似稍趨緊、惟巿氣穏定、祇以微細之起仆迨午刻收巿與前晚比較計先令縮零六二五、美金縮一二五、日金則漲一分矣、乃金巿復呈挺秀、已越出五百六十兩之外、然終日變化竟逹十兩有零、而人心已臻高昂也華商交易不暢僅以英金稍有扒進數萬鎊、住友三井三菱等賣出時有抛出少數、由麥行納進、華比住友與與業華義等互相做過二三萬鎊、至美日兩匯均處沉淪未有顧問云、</p>

<h3>厘拆定勢廣角飛騰</h3>
<p>市場槪况　目前銀洋巿况、一致疲滯、洋厘因幣廠開爐跌價、爲事實所應有、銀拆始終鬆濫、絕無月旦價値、至於銀行收解、大致亦屬平常、惟廣角因有大連帮大批去胃、價又狂漲、此外消息無要足錄、</p>
<p>厘拆價格（洋厘）早巿爲七錢二分八厘七毫半、較前日微好一毫二忽半午巿價無人竸爭、結果亦與早巿相同（銀拆）早巿又爲白借、午巿則爲二分、銀行掛牌及劃頭加水均無行情、</p>

<h3>糧食米巿因雨續漲</h3>
<p>閘北昨日河下來源仍少巿上走銷因天雨而極微但買氣尙稱不惡而貨客鑒於存到兩稀、一致喊高故破粳又漲兩角左右、但巿上高貨仍缺、悉祇中關、情勢甚佳、東新粳因天雨價尙盤旋於十八元至十八元半之間、按天雨後内地西新粳勢將展緩上巿故趨勢見緊新客尖見到數車、買氣活潑價格竟喊至十四元六角須升半元左右之鉅、該貨成本極廉、運商大獲其利也、自元隨勢微昂角許、情况轉秀、</p>
<p>滬南河下來源不多、巿銷因連朝天雨大淡故各檔交易寥寥破粳巿胃亦微、行情隨北巿面向榮、大盤約升一兩角、南帮簿稻亦極凋零以上兩項到銷均枯、東新粳到貨亦少、行情與前盤相彷、白元殊不開展裡路産價報堅、運申减少、而本街進意亦屬平常、故價祇微堅耳、</p>
<h3>標粉巿一再挫落</h3>
<p>昨日粉巿上下午開盤後各月份巿面、均一致呈疲落之象因洋麥之報價小夫七八角或一元零、多頭方面因天津帮陵續訂購洋粉、將來本粉之去路、當然减少、而洋行方面日來兜攬生意者、又頗活躍聞花旗粉　客還價三元九角正由洋行去電接洽因此之故、人心尤見惶恐本月份最低曾回到二兩五錢零二厘半較前日跌二分二厘半、後以補空頻勁略見圍起然大部份人心、依然低疲也結果本月份較前日小一分半、十月份小七厘半、十一月份小一分二厘半十二月份七厘半、正月份小一分二厘半、二月份小一分云、</p>
<h3>期麥巿步趨黯淡</h3>
<p>昨日期麥巿面、上下午開盤後、各月份巿面、又呈軟象因洋麥報價計小夫七八角至一元零、又兼大户多頭、均逐步了結、致市場空氣、彷彿步趨黯淡、因到貨方面、各路來源、反較新貨時暢旺、此後之粉銷又無振奮之望、故此後恐須依順環境鬆動一點也結果本月份較前日又小二分十月份不動十一月份小一分、十二月份大一分、一二月份小一分現麥巿面、因廠胃又滯、中次各檔、喊價小去一二分、高貨尙穏、開沙巿江西麥共開五百包、尙未配廠云、</p>

<h3>絲茶金華新秋蠶將上巿</h3>
<p>蠶蟻經過良好…豐收可望</p>
<p>浙省金華舊府屬蠶汎向較他處爲早、今歲因官廳之提倡、分發蠶種、故均從事孵育、飼額不弱、蠶蟻經過良好、現已上簇作繭、日内新繭可下簇、預料可望豐收也、</p>
<h3>無錫秋蠶早帮三眠已開葉</h3>
<p>葉片每担三元</p>
<p>本年春夏兩蠶收成失望、故農民對於本届秋蠶異常重視莫不多育但因蠶種關係、遲早相去甚遠、現早帮業已三眠開葉晚帮祇頭眠、蠶身甚佳、預測有良好之望、桑葉葉片每担售二元五角至三元、而尙無人出售、因十之九家都養蠶也、</p>
<h3>路莊珍眉英銷略動</h3>
<p>近日來路莊之珍眉綠茶、英莊錦隆天祥怡和同孚等行、均因海外來電訂購復起動辦、交易尙不寂寞、惟售開巿盤依然低弱、至祁寗紅茶自俄莊停頓以來、英莊行、家亦無人問、及巿面完全停滯云、</p>
<h3>疋頭東貨巿情搖扶直上</h3>
<p>棉布走勢較前爲呆</p>
<p>本廠棉布邇來巿面頗爲平定、去路不若以前之暢、實以時届落令、染坯去路自川帮止辦後大受打擊、北方需要亦見呆幸存底空虚、故尙無頽勢發現、但細斜紋有漲無跌、昨現貨更形見缺、本街所墊者全行出脫、大有一度斷檔之勢故居奇殊甚、廣東汕頭等帮、仍在搜辦細布趨勢轉疲、惟吉祥人鐘汽球一致見缺、粗布較軟、十四磅十三磅飛態俱小去有五分左右、粗斜益形見寂矣、</p>
<p>東西疋頭昨日漲勢更猛、東貨之細嗶嘰·直貢呢·直貢緞等暴跳不已尤以細嗶嘰最形激昂、上下午二巿相差五厘左右、實爲空前未有之奇漲、實球午後已售三錢、湖心亭二錢六分半、　雁慕秋二錢五分七厘半、百子二錢六分、較前日漲起均逹一分餘直貢緞第一功已售開三錢、四學士二錢九分半、直貢呢又高二厘半惟花色貨無大變更、西貢之放鯉延年直貢呢昨亦激漲、售開二錢四分、餘均堅定云、</p>
<h3>五金東白鐵昨有到貨</h3>
<p>東白鐵昨日匯山棧又到現貨六百十五扎（計一萬二千三百張）係七尺據多、出口近日尙活潑、故如長江内河諸帮均有點綴、而異軍突起之福州帮昨日亦有大批採辦計數逹三四千張、價格三七尺、每張售一兩一錢二分半、三六尺九錢三分聞已較前好起一分半、據熟悉此貨者云最近東洋近期無期、苟在一二星期内若無到貨巿面前途、定必漸趨樂觀也、</p>

<h3>商塲消息</h3>
<p>南京路新世界對面榮昌祁宣稱本號新到大批秋季呢帽、種類甚多、式樣時新、質料細軟顔色鮮明、均屬歐美著名廠家出品茲爲優待顧客起見、定價特别從廉云云、</p>
<p>浙江路天津路口南京襪衫廠宣稱、本廠新出品錦地衫褲、織花薄絨衫褲、質底精良、花散繁多、正應秋凉禦寒之妙品、又新到大帮呢帽、有五十餘種之多、定價自二元二角起至十九元五角止云云、</p>

<p>靑年園地</p>
<h3>覺悟的靑年</h3>
<p>「有知不在年高無知空長百歲、」如今我深深地相信了、</p>
<p>前天承王的介紹、很欣幸地認識了一位令人欽偑的靑年、很糼小的靑年、我在未經介紹認識他之前已和他的文字面過、當時、只不過是讚嘆他的文字流暢和筆調生動、見聞廣博和思想澈底而已、固然「讀其文、不知其人可乎、」但、事實上是有許多地方、不易逹其目的、也是無可奈何之事</p>
<p>現在我們認識了、他是位英俊的少年、年紀不過十七歲、細長的身材、満面的天眞、他活潑、但不失其鎭靜、他那和靄的神情、自然的令人可親、並且又長於辭令、由他談話中、知道他讀過若干的書籍、我是夢想曾幻到啊這、樣糼小的靑年、而能做出那般老練的文章、怎禁得我不驚嘆而愧不如呢、我是十二分地敬偑他、企慕他同時、更以虔誠地新禱着、希望中國靑年、個個及他那樣優秀、人人像他那般覺悟、及時澈底的覺悟、</p>
<p>現代靑年應有的認識及其使命是「時代靑年」第三期内重要論文之一、作者葉德懋君、就是上文我所景慕的那位小靑年、</p>
<p>現代的靑年之傍徨於岐途、確是無可諱言的事實、我們只是看到聽到墜落的靑年日增一日、幾若雨後春笋般地産出、如此、影響於未來的新社會和中華民族的前途將何堪設想、</p>
<p>「可是我們研究其墜落的原因、大都爲不明瞭現時代的背景及中國特殊的環境與危機、每被惡勢力所引同化、至於盲從、要救濟這種原因、惟有使其對現時代有淸楚的認識、不致盲從、同時灌輸民族意識、使其知中國民族之危機、促其覺悟、而回復到人生底戰塲上作一員勇敢的戰將爲自身而拯救、爲民族謀出路、爲未來社會造福音、最後並使其明瞭靑年的責任及其使命、」</p>
<p>我們不待讀他的下文、便可推定全文的佈局了、作者具着明析的頭腦深遠的眼光、以科學的手筆找出病態根源同時更對症下藥、以救現代一般靑年的世紀病、唯其如此、與普通的文字只講出病態的現象、而不尋出病理的根源、更不下絲毫斷語、可以說連甘草結梗之類都不開出結果、也不過是一場漫駡冷嘲熱諷、或者是淺薄的同情而已、作者却迴然不同所以他分開幾個階段出講、一、時代的轉換、二列强在華經濟的侵略三、中國之危機、甲農村經濟的崩潰、乙、剥削階級的産生、丙民族意識的消沉、四、我們的責任及其使命、</p>
<p>作者的筆調、異常暢逹、有若長江大河、一瀉千里而不可遏止似地、所以關於前三節則無從抄趁割了東、又捨不得西、與其那樣掛一漏萬地有損原文的原氣、反不若留得讀者自己去探討、但是、我敢担保、絕不致使你們失望、並且還得共讚一聲、痛快淋漓、</p>
<p>現在僅第四節約略介紹、</p>
<p>呵—、靑年呵—時代已經來臨了、已不容我們再行彷徨、徘徊於十字街頭、高距象牙之塔、更不容我們再行惡化了、我們唯有急起奮鬥、來謀民族運動、以民族意識爲中心意識、撲滅一切非民族意識及無中心意識的惡勢力、因爲中國目前唯一的最大危機就是在民族意識消沉、反民族意識勃興呵—我們爲拯救自身計爲民族前途計、爲社會存亡計、我們不得不謀我們民族中心意識運動、這樣、才是我們當前的唯一的大責任及使命呵—然而還得認淸一點、就是我們所主張的民族意識、不是像日耳曼、大和民族所主張的單純的民族意識、只圖侵略别民族爲己任、我瘳是要全世界一切弱小民族起來自决、這是在我們負責任及使命以前一個應有的認識、總括的說一句、我們責任是負拯救中國目前的危機、我們的使命、是以民族意識爲中心意識去負一切的責任</p>
<p>最後、須聲明的、我作本文的動機、並不是特地像捧角似地亂捧一塲、這是要請讀者與作者予以原諒我的同的有兩種、一則在將（時代靑年）介紹給諸位、於一般失意的靑年、或許可以有相當的指導和安慰、二則在將這位靑年的作者介紹給諸位、或可略得借鏡和警愓、也是對於作者的一點敬禮呵（潔之）</p>
<h3>南洋模範中學添辦高中</h3>
<p>交大停止升送初中畢業生</p>
<p>裁撤預科</p>
<p>南洋模範小學原爲南洋大學附屬中小學改組而成、故其敎授精神仍與交大一貫、每届畢業生（初中畢業）均可升至交大預科、自敎育部通令國文各大學廢除預科以後、交大當局即遵部令籌備廢除預科之辦法、當經决定本届預科、不招收新生但本届南洋模範中小學之畢業生、仍可照合同升至預科、明年以後、即不得照升、以便逐年裁撤、至民國二十二年以後即可完全廢去此議成後、而南洋之校舍遷讓問題、不旋踵而起、學生家屬紛紛呈請敎育部鐵道部准予不遷讓續辦、敎育部據呈後、即派人赴該校調查經過、繕具報告、呈報部中、敎部據報後、以爲南洋係私立學校交大係國立大學私立學校非經入學考試、不得升入國立大學敎部已有明令該校雖有特别情形契約根據但不應藐視部章於是令行巿敎育局轉令南洋模範、不得將畢業生保升、一面直接令知交大不得收受、於是南洋升學問題遂成幻泡、雖百般設法、均不得要領、現該校據學生家屬之請求、創設高中、以備初中畢業生升學之用、而免學生失學之苦、現已籌備妥當、一切敎員大半均係上學年交大預科敎員、如英文則由前交大敎員朱樹蒸、算學則由張魯鏡敎授、一切敎法、均仿照交大預科、以備將來投考時之便利今年初辦只辦高中一正不招收新生將來逐漸添辦高二高三兩年後、則該校可成爲一完全之兩級中學云云、</p>
<h3>交大自然科學院成立</h3>
<p>交通大學前奉部令添設理學院、以培植各路局材料試騐及化學分析之人才、該校奉令後積極籌備、先以南院校舍被南洋模範中小學借用、故屢催南洋空屋、以備理學院之院址、現南洋方面因一時無從找屋、且交大校址廣大、無缺乏院址之處、故不允交還交大方面亦不能久待南洋搬屋後始辦理學院、因之决定在上院方面成立理學院、該校原有理化試騐設備甚爲完善、故此次創設理學院無甚困難惟以鐵路局方面理化人才、需用不多故定學額甚少、每班只十名、今年先行成立物理化學兩系、以後再陸續添辦數學系地質系、以完成理學院今歲招生前因籌備不及、故該校前次招生、理學院並不招收、現定九月七日至十日、在上海本部招考十名新生、惟該校以理學院名稱太通欲、改稱自然科學院英文名（Puro　Scince　College、)　從此該校設有三獨立學院、即工程、鐵道管理、自然科學三院、共十餘系、適合敎育部（大學規程）之規定、稱爲完全在學此次招生時間已遲、外界人士多不明眞相、實則該院學生將來畢業後之出路、實較其他各院爲優、因人數不多、求過於供、聞該學院院長爲徐明材、物理系主任爲裘維裕、化學系主任爲柯成懋、敎員則須加聘胡敦復等擔任云、</p>
<h3>世界女童子軍大會</h3>
<p>— 雋山</p>
<p>近代社會現象中最令人驚奇的、就是童子軍和女童子軍的運動、這種運動、怕是現在國際中一種極强極有希望的一種溝通、當童子軍起先創立時、是大爲一般守舊的老先生們所反對的、等女童子軍運動發𨋃時、那班老先生實在是撟舌不能�、以爲自己生錯了一個世界了、但到了今日、據我們所知的、英國的童子軍事業雖是發逹、但女童子軍的事業、却更是發逹、一國内女童子軍的人數、竟較男童子軍的人數更多十萬、</p>
<p>今年七月在英國漢省狐租公園舉行一個世界女童子軍大會、到會者共二百代表、包含三十國家、這是一個極歡樂努力的一個會集、有的代表都穿了本國的服裝同樂會時唱各國的歌、會中所定、以英文法文德文爲正式語但因英語的普偏性、法文德文幾乎不用的女童子軍的各種問題、在會中都曾討論、女童子軍的世界聯會也組織完竣、故成績很是不凡、</p>
<p>童子軍和女童子軍運動的首創者、具登包惠爾爵士也到會參加、在他的演說中有兩點特别注重的、一是女童子軍運動對靑年界人格上訓練的價値、一是女童子軍於國際和平運動中可幹的事務、</p>

<h3>回娘家—愛國「二」</h3>
<p>甲、訓育上—一校校風的優劣大半靠内部的訓育、尤其是女校、對於校譽的好壤、差不多是人人津津樂道的、愛國不消說有三十年悠久的歷史、當爲社會一般人士所信任景慕同時、外界對之望之也殷、責之也苛爲責備求全起見、是以在上半年有時會聽到對於愛國的批評、大致謂管理上訓育上有未盡善處、誠然、也難怪别人議論的、因爲校内宿舍不敷應用、於是在天保里租了好多房子、作爲校外寄宿舍、其實内部還照樣有舍監先生、這外界當不能明瞭如今呢、一切都可以改進了據孫先生講訓育上嚴格防止受外界不良習氣薰染不差現在的環境確可以照章行事活潑親愛、我並非誇大、愛國的女兒、誠當之無愧、各級指導和宿舍指導、住校者有擔任童子軍訓練的黄汕先生、歌舞專家沈明珍先生、新聘的歌舞家管素文先生、係金陵女大大出身而魏雪淸先生則勤勞樸實、指導學生極爲老練、還有宿擅英文與琴學的陳妙明先生、和富於美術天才的許君靖先生、這幾位女士、都是不易聘得的良好敎師、訓育上有這幾位女士共策進行當不致有負外界的一番厚望、加之地位之優美、園庭之優美、其能别開生面者、可以想見、乙、學科上—各級程度極力提高入學考試的嚴格學科方面亦略有更改高、一起改爲普通科體育科改三年制、至敎師方面、可謂極力羅致留美女界前輩聶霞瑜碩士、也在被聘之列、高中級任、依然是兪劍華先生任高三、李天行先生任高二、孫貽謀先生任高一、英文敎師還是蘇兆龍張石庵胡尙新諸先生</p>
<p>丙、設備上—校址旣適當而各項設置亦極相稱、敎室的佈置桌椅等均係革新、光線尤爲充足、圖書館、聞將建設大學圖書器具、全部購留、健身房現已招工興築、位置設在桃園中、至若宿舍的優美、在中等學校中、誠不多看見、</p>
<p>丁、愛國於文學及體育上、素有歷史的、前聞創辦人蔡子民先生等同季校長孫主任會談之下、主張以文學之力革新一般女子的思想、以敎育的手腕深入社會服務、不日將召集校董會及敎育專家議定具體辦法、</p>
<p>照此看來、不但是我們出了嫁女兒的聞之快慰、實在是我們女界敎育前途的福音呵、</p>
<p>「到我那邊去坐坐吧、」</p>
<p>「好的」、說着告别了孫先生、而同兪師向他的寓所走去、</p>
<p>呵、好極了、純粹中國式的單房、周遭圍満樹木、黄土的天井、籬笆的圍墻、笆上爬満了荳籐、還開着紫花、籬笆外面、植着許多枝葉茂盛的向日葵、儼然是道自然的綠屏風、更有一對纖塵不染白鵝和一對麻鴨、在不等方的天井中點綴着、屋後林中、還有淸水的小溪、望過去便是「虹口牛奶棚」有許許多多的水牛、我對兪師講、「這才正合您往哩、是多麽好的一個畫家呵」、「哈哈、我還得去學琴哩、疊會專留來對牛彈呵」、</p>
<p>這是娘家的近况、娘家是改進了許多令我們這些出嫁的女兒回到婆家增加了不少的光輝、（光美）</p>

<p>The Problem of the Submarine Cable Treaty</p>
<h3>Three Companies Have Not Yet Replied</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of abolishing the treaty of the three submarine cable companies, Great Northern, Eastern Extension, and Pacific, the result of the meeting in Nanjing last week was that the company representatives agreed to telegraph the methods proposed by our side to their respective parent companies for instructions, but no reply date was set. The commissioners responsible for the negotiations on our side fear that they will delay again and have decided to send a letter next week to urge them. According to the person in charge who participated in this meeting, the most important key to the meeting is to take back the landing rights. If this point is not resolved, our country's laws and sovereignty will still be lost, and it cannot be fundamentally recognized. The second is the right to send and receive, which is very important politically. In the past, important international political situations were often deliberately manipulated by the company when transmitting telegrams, so that foreign countries with vested interests would know first, while we were relatively behind, which had a considerable impact. Therefore, this right cannot be abandoned. Regarding the layer of apportioning quotations, the government was ignorant of the international situation and rashly compromised, resulting in our country's share being extremely small. In fact, since the cable is in our country's territory, our country has the right to set its own prices. The term "apportionment" means being controlled by others. As for increasing quotations, after repeated discussions, they did not decide because they feared that the growing development of wireless radio would affect their business. Of the three companies doing business here, the one with the greatest vested interests is Great Northern, because its business is entirely based in Shanghai, so it is fighting hard. Eastern Extension and Pacific are easier to resolve, but they are also constrained by Great Northern. However, no matter what, we will never give up the interests that we should have in maintaining legal sovereignty, and we will definitely insist to the end. The previous government's debts to the company have been repaid by more than one million each year in the apportioned quotations. As of now, only several million are owed, and even if we raise the funds, it will not be difficult. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications previously met with the three companies, Great Northern, Eastern Extension, and Pacific, and canceled the company's exclusive right to land submarine cables in China. The Ministry yesterday consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs again and presented it to the government to notify European, American, and Japanese countries that no government or private individual will be allowed to have exclusive rights to land submarine cables in China in the future, in order to protect sovereignty.

<h3>The Revolutionary Trend in South America</h3>
<p>Mexico in the Americas has long been known for its frequent revolutions. However, in recent times, it has gradually stabilized. As for the South American countries, although the land is not very large and the countries are not very strong, peace within the country has not been heard of for a long time since there have been warnings of revolution. Recently, revolutions have been reported one after another, and there is more than one country. The revolution in Peru did not last long, and the political crisis in Argentina followed closely behind. The Prime Minister has resigned and the President has decided to step down, which is no different from a revolution. As the old saying goes, when the copper mountain in the west collapses, the bronze bell in Luoyang rings in the east. It can be seen that all things in the world are related. How much more so are countries on the same continent?</p>
<p>Speaking from a detailed point of view, each country has its own politics, its own history, and its own customs, which are different from each other. However, from a broad point of view, what is called humanity is not very different. Most of the South American countries are Latin peoples, and they are even more similar than those of different ethnicities. Therefore, if one country has these advantages and disadvantages, other countries will also have the same. If one country has a crisis due to advantages and disadvantages, other countries will also be affected. The speed or method may be different, but the principle of their occurrence is the same. Why? The so-called trend will inevitably spread. Those that are similar and alike will inevitably be affected. Therefore, the ancients valued good neighbors, and were not wary of the thickness of the neighbors and the thinness of the rulers. If one only hopes for the chaos of neighboring countries to benefit oneself, this is a superficial and ignorant attitude, and eventually disaster will also befall oneself one day.</p>

<h3>Brewing a Major Political Upheaval</h3>
<p>The President Decides to Resign</p>
<p>The Minister of War Suddenly Resigns</p>
<p>Associated Press, Buenos Aires, 2nd: Argentine President Hipólito Yrigoyen, in view of the tense domestic situation, has decided to resign. The cabinet unanimously agrees. The presidential duties will be temporarily assumed by Vice President Martínez.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Argentina, 2nd: According to the United Press Agency today, Argentine Vice President Martínez and several important figures of the Radical Party have joined forces, urging President Yrigoyen to resign and demanding an immediate response. Although the current authorities in Buenos Aires are desperately trying to paint a peaceful picture, denying any political upheaval, the activities of the army and navy suggest that the situation has become tense.</p>
<p>Reuters, Buenos Aires, 2nd: It is rumored that a major political crisis is about to occur in Argentina. The Chief of the Army has already resigned, and it is believed that other cabinet members will follow suit. The government is on high alert. Eleven warships are anchored in the harbor. Yesterday, a marine platoon landed but later returned to the ships. Today, the police searched the National University because it was rumored that the school was harboring military weapons. President Yrigoyen is currently suffering from the flu and is bedridden, unable to go out.</p>
<h3>Australia Discriminates Against Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Consul General in Sydney Requests Fair Treatment</p>
<p>Reuters, Canberra, 2nd: The Chinese Consul General in Sydney, Australia, sent a note to the Australian government on May 1, requesting the cessation of the procedure of fingerprinting Chinese immigrants, stating that this procedure is very embarrassing for the National Government because its citizens are demanding the same treatment for Australians entering China. The Chinese Consul General also stated that the Australian authorities' search of overseas Chinese to prevent the entry of deported Chinese does not extend to the citizens of other countries. The Chinese Consul General believes that the power to search Chinese alone should be restricted. The Chinese Consul General, based on moral grounds, opposes the Australian authorities' prohibition of the entry of wives and children of overseas Chinese. The Chinese Consul General also suggested that elderly overseas Chinese who return to their country be allowed to have their younger relatives come to Australia to continue their businesses. Australian Prime Minister Scullin has now replied that he will only consider temporarily allowing the entry of wives and children of overseas Chinese, and the rest cannot be agreed to. The Australian Prime Minister stated that the right to search is limited to cases where there is a well-founded belief that deported foreigners who have sneaked into Australia can be found. This right also applies to the citizens of other countries. He also stated that fingerprinting is not limited to overseas Chinese, nor does it apply to upper-class Chinese, permanent residents, or transit passengers. The Australian Prime Minister stated that this issue is closely related to Australia's overseas Chinese policy and that there is absolutely no intention to insult the Chinese.</p>
<p>Three Swedish Explorers</p>
<h3>Remains Receive Funeral Rites</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Tromsø, 2nd: The remains of Arctic flying explorer Andrée and his companions were transferred from the whaling ship Bragdvåg to the city hospital this morning. The townspeople lined the streets to watch, and all removed their hats to pay their respects. After the remains were examined in the hospital, they were placed in metal coffins and moved to the church, covered with the Swedish flag. The Norwegian fishing patrol ship Senkesund continued to patrol as a guard. It is now known that Mr. Andrée's skull is missing. This time, his surname was identified only from the letters embroidered on his clothes. The relics are currently being studied by experts sent by the Swedish government. It is also learned that his diary has not been found. What was found was a travel log. According to the record, the balloon seemed to have stayed in the air for only a few days. After landing, the three men traveled through glaciers and crevasses for three to four hundred kilometers to reach White Island.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Stockholm, 2nd: According to a report from the leader of the Norwegian Arctic exploration team, Mr. Horn, about the discovery of Andrée's remains, a crew member of the whaling ship Bragdvåg went ashore to hunt seals and suddenly saw a ship's hook on the snow from afar. Surprised, he reported it to everyone. Mr. Horn led the crowd to go there, chiseled through the ice with an axe, and found the tent and remains. It is presumed that Mr. Andrée's diary is still buried in the snow, but his travel log is also very interesting. Although the record is only a few pages, it covers a period of more than two months. It also shows that the three men traveled four hundred kilometers through snowstorms in the Arctic winter, without a single word of frustration or discouragement, and even planned the next expedition. Their superhuman perseverance and courage are admirable. According to Mr. Horn's speculation, the three men arrived at White Island around December.</p>
<h3>Diet's Fact-Finding Committee Situation</h3>
<p>Appears Unfavorable to the Government</p>
<p>Government Bonds Suddenly Trend Downward</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 3rd: After the news that the Privy Council's Fact-Finding Committee's report was unfavorable to the government spread, the stock market yesterday was in great turmoil, with all stocks trending upward, in a state of extreme tension. Everyone is wary of the results of today's Fact-Finding Committee, as there will be a major reaction. On the other hand, the government bond market has already shown weakness when there was talk of abandoning the non-debt policy of the current cabinet. Adding to the report of the deterioration of the relationship with the Privy Council, the downward trend is even more pronounced. If the Ministry of Interior's planned road bonds of 40 million yen are confirmed to be issued, it will inevitably further soften the market.</p>
<p>Japan United Press, Tokyo, 3rd: The sixth session of the Privy Council's Fact-Finding Committee convened at 1:00 p.m. today. All Privy Council members and the three ministers of the government attended. A fierce debate began on the issue of the right of supreme command. The Privy Council considered the replies of the Minister of Finance and the Minister of the Navy on the first day to be sophistry and insisted on clarifying their attitude. The reasons are as follows: (1) The actions of Prime Minister Hamaguchi at the time of the administrative disposition clearly violated the right of supreme command, as can be clearly seen from the statement of the Chief of the Naval General Staff, Admiral Katō, and the correspondence between Katō and the Minister of Finance; (2) The Minister of Finance claimed that Katō had agreed, but the words and actions of Minister Katō did not indicate agreement, violating the major principle; (3) If the Naval General Staff did not agree, the government's actions clearly violated the explicit provisions of the Constitution; (4) The Minister of Finance and the Navy admitted that the responsibility for the final proposal was very significant.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Shipping Industry is Depressed</h3>
<p>The Number of Idle Ships Continues to Increase</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 3rd: According to an investigation by the Ministry of Communications, there were a total of 378 idle ships in mid-August, with a total tonnage of 177,000 tons, an increase of 50,000 tons compared to mid-July and an increase of 140,000 tons compared to the same period last year. If this continues, the number of idle ships by the end of the year will reach 300,000 to 400,000 tons, which shows that the depression in the shipping industry is even worse than before.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 3rd: In order to cope with the depression in the shipping industry, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) has further implemented thorough ship layups. Of the thirteen ships on the New York route, in addition to the Maebashi Maru and Kako Maru, which have already been laid up and not reopened, the Toyama Maru, Tokiwa Maru, and Kuma Maru have also been decided to be laid up.</p>
<h3>Australian Budget Proposal May Cause Political Upheaval</h3>
<p>Reuters, Canberra, 2nd: The Australian Federal Cabinet cannot agree on the proposals to borrow money, cut staff, and reduce salaries to maintain the budget. Prime Minister Scullin, who is about to leave for England to attend the Imperial Conference, may be recalled due to this political upheaval. The Acting Prime Minister and the Minister of Postal Services advocate respecting the promises made to Sir Otto Niemeyer, the financial advisor who was invited to Australia, but at the meeting today, the majority of cabinet members disagreed with their proposal, saying that tariff revenue may be short by nine million pounds, making it difficult to balance the budget. The urgent proposal to convene Parliament to discuss the financial crisis was also opposed, but the final decision will have to wait until the cabinet meeting on September 5. If a political upheaval occurs on the 5th, then Scullin will be recalled from Athens. If the Acting Prime Minister wins, Parliament will be convened in October.</p>

Police Chief Tegart, who was almost assassinated a week ago, personally led many police officers, departing from Calcutta at midnight and arriving in Chandernagore in the early morning. They entered the forest and snaked forward, but the people in the house had already heard the sound and ran out, opening fire. During the firefight, the police captured one person carrying a loaded pistol, and two others fell to the ground and were also captured by the police, all carrying firearms. A man named Mahango Saisel, who is likely to be a key figure in the party, also fell into the pond after being injured and is presumed to have drowned.

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Recent News on Bandit Suppression in Hunan Province</h3>
<p>Wei and Liu Exchange Messages of Mutual Understanding</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, Huang Gonglue, and their respective troops joined forces and entered Hunan from Jiangxi, He Jian, the commander-in-chief of the Fourth Route Army, believed that Pingxiang and Liuyang were dangerous and difficult to annihilate, so he decided to shorten the front line and lure the bandits deeper. This caused rumors, and the survivors of the Changsha massacre, like frightened birds, fled in droves. In fact, Hunan Province already has the four divisions of Wei Suzhong, Luo Fan, Ying, Liu Jianxu, and Tao Guang, the two brigades of Chen Guangzhong and Chen Wo, and the troops from Hubei Province entering Hunan include the four divisions of Luo Lin, Gong Bingfan, Li Yunlong, and Qian Dajun. The troops from Jiangxi Province are also more than two divisions. In terms of air force, in addition to the four existing aircraft, the squadron leader of the Fifth Aviation Squadron, Tian Xi, led four more aircraft on the first of this month, two of which returned to Hankou and two remained in Hunan, for a total of six aircraft, and the armored train team Xiang E Hao, the military strength is now stronger than before. Although according to a telegram from the captain of the Xiang E Hao armored train team, Luo Xiancheng, Zhu, Mao, Peng, and others, divided into several routes from Dongshan, Yong'an City, and Datupo, are advancing towards Changsha, the large army is gathered, and the defenses of the provincial capital are solid and will definitely not succeed. As for the rumors that Wei Suzhong and Liu Jianxu have disagreements, making the situation in Hunan difficult, Wei and Liu both telegraphed yesterday to dispel the rumors, which is also sufficient to prove their inaccuracy. The two telegrams are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Wei Suzhong's telegram to Director Hu Xiaoyan (Director of the Fourth Route Army Office in Hankou), transferred to the brothers Xiang Sanrun, Jingluo, and others in Hunan Province: I have received your telegram with respect. My brother and Hui (Liu Jianxu) are both under the unified command of the commander-in-chief, and we have shared hardships and hopes for a long time. Now that the great enemy is at hand, even the hatred of killing one's father should be abandoned, let alone that my brother and Hui have no grievances. The rumors are half due to the fabrications of reactionaries. These people are blinded by material desires and do not cherish the people. Changsha has also been clamorous recently, and it has been relieved immediately after the joint announcement. Brothers in Hankou, I hope that you will convey my sincere feelings to all parties, so that they can see that the will of the generals of the Fourth Route Army is very unified. Respectfully, your brother Wei Suzhong.</p>
<p>Liu Jianxu's telegram to Hu Xiaoyan and transferred to brothers Yu Xiangsan and Ling Daru: I have received your telegram with respect. My brother and all the officers and men have been close friends in adversity for decades, sharing life and death, and are firmly united. We are working together harmoniously with Li (Wei Suzhong), and there is no disagreement. The plans for this attack and defense have been decided after direct consultation. Extraneous unconcerned politicians and frustrated soldiers have fabricated rumors and sowed discord for no reason, which is extremely hateful. Rumors stop with the wise, so there is no need to dispel them. I am honored by your inquiry, I hope you will understand. Respectfully, your brother Liu Jianxu.</p>
<h3>Hunan Authorities Investigate Rumors</h3>
<p>Letter to the Chamber of Commerce Inquiring Whether Reactionaries are Spreading Rumors</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Replies Requesting That the War Situation at the Front Be Announced in Summary</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: After the Fourth Route Army withdrew from Liucheng and lured the bandits deeper, the citizens of Changsha were in a panic, as if a great disaster was about to happen. Supporting the old and carrying the young, more than 50,000 people fled to Hankou and Gao. There were also rumors that the political situation was about to change. He Jian and Liu Jianxu heard that these rumors came from the Chamber of Commerce and sent a letter to inquire. The Chamber of Commerce replied immediately upon receiving the letter, stating that the Chamber had not heard of what was mentioned in the letter and that the family members of military personnel were moving, and armed soldiers were escorting luggage in a continuous stream, causing the people to panic. The Chamber of Commerce has always maintained calm, and its colleagues have not left their posts, and all stores are operating as usual. The various rumors are not responsible, etc. The exchange of letters between the two parties is disclosed below:</p>
<p>Headquarters' Letter to the Chamber of Commerce: The remaining bandits of Peng, Huang, Zhu, and Mao are still attempting a last-ditch struggle after their defeat. Our route army, in cooperation with friendly troops, is luring them out of the mountains in order to encircle and annihilate them. The military deployment is very secure, and the security of the provincial capital is not a concern. However, in recent days, the public's morale has been unusually turbulent, and it is no wonder that they are like frightened birds. Reactionaries, being insane, are trying to take advantage of this opportunity to fabricate all kinds of nonsensical rumors to disrupt the situation, which is extremely hateful. Yesterday afternoon, it was suddenly rumored that the political situation would change that night and that something would break out at a certain time. People were like frightened birds, passing the word around. When asked where they got it from, nine out of ten said that the news came from the Chamber of Commerce. Our department believed at the time that it was too worthless and could be proven that night, so we did not investigate it further. However, the mouths of the public not only affect security but also have a significant impact on your Chamber. How did the rumors originate, and are there any reactionaries in your Chamber spreading rumors? The responsible personnel of your Chamber should pay attention to this and maintain security.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce's Reply to the Headquarters: We respectfully reply that we have received your letter stating that rumors occurred yesterday and that we heard that they were spread by our Chamber, and we are asked to pay attention to them to maintain security, etc. Our Chamber's responsibility is to ensure the safety of the business community. If there are rumors, the business of merchants will be greatly affected. We would not even have time to close the doors, let alone want to spread rumors for no reason, causing mutual suspicion and harming ourselves. As for the rumors mentioned in your letter that the political situation would change yesterday, we not only do not believe it but also have not heard as much detail as stated in your letter. As for the so-called nine out of ten, who are they, and who is spreading this saying, which must be attributed to our Chamber? We sincerely do not know their intention. Even today, Chief of Staff Tang of the newly formed 22nd Division came to the Chamber and said that a pontoon bridge had been built at Nanhugang, and when asked of the Headquarters, it was said that it was at the request of our Chamber. However, our Chamber not only did not make this request but also did not send anyone to your department to make any suggestions. Even yesterday, the captain of the water police came to the Chamber and said that if merchants wanted to build a pontoon bridge, they had to make a formal written request, but our Chamber never made a decision. From this alone, it can be seen that the previous rumors did not originate from our Chamber. Furthermore, in recent days, the family members of military personnel have been moving, and armed soldiers have been escorting luggage in a continuous stream, causing the people to panic. Our Chamber has always maintained calm, and its colleagues have not left their posts, and all stores are still operating as usual. At this time, when the flames are high in front, the actions of the military are related to the observation and listening of the people. However, the military has suddenly moved to the rear, and the people do not know the truth, causing them to panic. We hope that you will announce the movement of the troops and the war situation at the front at any time in summary, so that you can calm the people's hearts and eliminate any rumors without any intervention. As for the question in your letter about whether there are reactionaries, merchants have no political minds or factions. This is what our Chamber can be confident in. The previous content of the letter is respectfully replied, and we hope that you will consider and implement it.</p>
<h3>Tan Daoyuan's Division Returns to Jiangxi to Suppress Communists</h3>
<p>Deputy Division Commander Yue Has Arrived in the Provincial Capital</p>
<p>Jiangxi Troops Enter Hunan to Pursue and Attack Communist Bandits</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Commander-in-Chief Lu and all sectors of the province believe that the land is full of bandits, and the bandit areas are vast, and the original troops are insufficient to be allocated, causing the people of various counties to be in dire straits and displaced. They have repeatedly telegraphed the Central Government and Commander-in-Chief Jiang, requesting that capable troops be sent to Jiangxi to assist in the suppression, in order to relieve the people from suffering. When Zhu Mao approached Nanxun, Jiang immediately telegraphed an order for one regiment of the 150th Brigade to return to Jiangxi first, and the rest to continue to set off. Now, the 149th Brigade of the division arrived in Jiujiang on the 28th of last month. Yue Sen, the deputy division commander and commander of the 149th Brigade, arrived in Xun from Beijing and took the Nanxun Road night train to the province at 12:00 p.m. on the 31st. When the train arrived at Niuhang Station, there were many welcomers. After Yue got off the train, he crossed the river and entered the city. This morning, Mr. Yue went to visit Commander-in-Chief Lu and Director Zhang's private residence to report on the past operations and ask for instructions on future bandit suppression plans. It is said that the brigade was ordered to station in the Tujiapu area of Nanxun Road to take care of the defenses of Jiujiang and northern Jiangxi. The two brigades of Cheng Guangyao and Luo Shouyi will also arrive successively. All sectors are preparing to hold a welcoming meeting because Tan's division has returned to Jiangxi. Once Director Tan arrives in the province, it can be held to express welcome.</p>
<p>On the 27th, a Central Army airplane dropped bombs in the sky over Beiping. One bomb fell near the residence of Wang Jingwei and damaged a corner of a certain family's house. This is a photo taken after the house was destroyed.</p>
<p>After the communist bandits Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, He, and Kong held a fake military conference in Wanzai, they divided into four routes to attack Changsha again. Zhu and Mao passed through the north of Liling from Wanzai, Peng and Huang passed through the Liuyang Avenue from Xiutong, and He Long and Kong also launched separately on the Hubei border. From the 25th to the 26th, the fighting in Liuyang was extremely fierce. According to news from the Ninth Route Army Headquarters, Director He has transferred the two divisions of Gong Bingfan and Luo Lin from Pingjiang to Changsha, and the troops of Tao Guang, Chen Guangzhong, and Dai Douyuan of the Fourth Route Army are guarding the area along Monkey Stone, Yuhuating, and Laodao River, with very tight defenses. After Commander-in-Chief Lu received the telegrams from He, he also ordered the vanguard brigade of Dai Yue of the 18th Division to advance from Xiutong across Pingliu, closely following Zhu Mao and Peng Huang. Yesterday, a telegram was received from Dai Yue, stating that Zhu Mao and Peng Huang are planning to disturb Hunan again, and the brigade is now transferring the heavy artillery battalion to Hunan to pursue and attack, encircling them from three sides in the hope of annihilating the bandits near Changsha.</p>
<p>In eastern Jiangxi, Commander-in-Chief Lu ordered Zhang's regiment in Yujiang to stop suppressing the communist bandits in Poyang. On the 28th, it joined forces with the warship Minzu and the machine gun company of the 18th Division to recapture the county. Zhang's regiment is currently cooperating with County Magistrate Jiang to pursue the remaining bandits. At the same time, the Zhejiang provincial government has also appointed a large team to advance from Changshan and station in Yushan and Shangrao, attacking the bandits from behind in the hope of annihilating them.</p>
<p>Regarding the security of the provincial capital, Lu Dipin built fortifications near Nanchang in June in order to consolidate the provincial capital. The Nanchang General Chamber of Commerce raised 30,000 yuan for construction costs. A new type of trench and electric fence were built around the city. Later, when Changsha fell and Zhu Mao approached Nanxun, Lu became more vigilant and raised funds from the provincial government to build another layer of fortifications. Now, in addition to these two layers of fortifications, another layer of obstacles has been built. The three layers of fortifications have been completed recently and are very solid. In addition to the commander of the 18th division, Zhang, the chief of staff of the Ninth Route Army, Xiao, and the brigade commander of the 53rd brigade, Wang, who inspected them by flying around, Lu also inspected the fortifications around the city on the morning of August 27th at about 9:00 a.m., accompanied by Chief of Staff Xie, on the Moshi warplane. The plane hovered in the air for about thirty minutes before landing. It is said that Lu is very satisfied with these fortifications. After this, only a thousand soldiers will be able to defend against the communist bandits, and the 10,000 people of Nanchang City can rest assured.</p>
<h3>Ji'an Cracks Down on the Communist Party's General Headquarters</h3>
<p>Dozens of Important Communist Bandits Arrested</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Ji'an is the center of culture, commerce, and transportation in western Jiangxi, and also the throat of transportation between Ganzhou and the provincial capital. Its position is extremely important. Since Zhu Mao established Ninggang and Yongxin in western Jiangxi as their base in the 16th year of the Republic [1927], they have long desired Ji'an and have been unwilling to give up. This time, when Zhu Mao fled east, they still left bandit troops, the pseudo-20th Army and the 22nd Army, to surround Ji'an, attempting to succeed at any cost. On July 1st, Duan Qifeng, the army commander of the pseudo-20th Army, led more than 10,000 bandits to attack Ji'an several times with great ferocity. However, because the important areas around the city and along the river were fortified with electric fences, trenches, bunkers, and artillery forts, and there were also the "National People's Rights" and "People's Rights" warships patrolling the river, preventing the bandits from crossing, Ji'an was finally spared. Now, according to Ji'an's wireless report on the 27th, after the communist bandits repeatedly attacked the city and suffered disastrous defeats, they realized that armed force would be difficult to succeed with. Therefore, they changed their strategy and secretly sent assassination squad leader Chen Cherui, arson squad leader Zeng Guotang, and movement squad leader Huang Hansheng to infiltrate Ji'an to organize institutions and conduct secret activities, hoping to coordinate from within and without. Fortunately, the military police's inspection was effective, and the communist party's general headquarters in Ji'an was cracked down. Chen, Zeng, Huang, and dozens of important members were arrested, and many documents, plans, and reactionary propaganda materials were confiscated. The New 13th Division's military court is currently handling the case strictly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Gujiang is the necessary route from Ji'an to Anfu, and was previously occupied by communist bandits. Anfu was also captured by bandits. Now, after Deng's division defeated the communist bandits, Anfu was recovered. The county magistrate has already returned to the county to handle the aftermath. (August 28th)</p>
<h3>Fuzhou on High Alert</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After the end of the second phase of the war in Fujian Province, the local area gradually began to lift martial law. Now, the provincial government believes that the third phase of the war is about to begin. Chen Guohui's brigade and Lin Qinglong's regiment of the Fujian Southern Provincial Defense Army's First Division have already advanced from Yongchun to Dehua and Zhangtian. Liu Zongyi's unit of the Fujian Eastern Provincial Police Force and Lin Bingzhou's regiment of the naval and land joint teams have already advanced from Shouning to Zhenghe and Songxi. Liu Heding's division in Fuzhou has also completed its deployment, and will soon be able to cooperate with Liang Jichuan and Huang Bingwu's units in Yongtai and Xixiang to advance towards Gutian and Minqing, taking a three-sided encirclement of Lu's troops. Compared with the first and second phases of the war, where only Fuzhou fought alone, the scope is even wider. The provincial capital is an important rear defense base, and its importance is extremely high. Yesterday afternoon, Yang Shuzhuang specially convened a meeting with Liu Shangzhi, the Fuzhou martial law commander, Mao Zhencai, the Minhou Fortress commander, Guo Yongrong, the Public Security Bureau chief, and Shen Ke, the Water Public Security Bureau chief, and decided to announce special martial law on land and water from today onwards. Regarding the water aspects, all ships entering from various ports must be strictly inspected by the Minhou Fortress Command before being allowed to disembark passengers and unload goods. Ships traveling to and from the inner harbor of the Min River will have inspection stations set up by the Water Public Security Bureau at Xigang Hongshan Bridge and Nangang Sanbao Road. All passing ships can only be released after inspection. On the land aspect, the martial law command will work with the city's Public Security Bureau to send armed soldiers and police to inspect pedestrians at important locations in the city. Those who carry firearms and ammunition privately without a permit will be dealt with by military law. At the same time, military police detective teams and inspection teams will conduct spot checks on suspicious households to see if they are privately hiding military supplies. The Lianjia system for each shop, which had been suspended since the lifting of local martial law, will now be reinstated by the city's Public Security Bureau, which will issue 24 articles of the Lianjia method to each shop to be implemented again. The provincial government's gatekeeping has also been especially tightened since yesterday. Additional guards have been assigned to all locations within the government and around its perimeter. Those not wearing the government's emblem will absolutely not be allowed to enter, and even those wearing the emblem must have their belongings opened for inspection. Yang Shuzhuang stays in the provincial government day and night and does not return home. The aircraft, which had been suspended for a long time, were also redeployed yesterday, with two planes dispatched to the northwestern front line to scout the enemy's situation. In recent days, the 56th Division and the Marine Corps have been test-firing artillery and torpedoes in the Kangshan and Jinjishan areas of Dongmen, and the rumbling sounds have shaken people's eardrums. The current situation in Fuzhou is gradually becoming tense again. (August 30th)</p>
<h3>Hubei Special Commissioner's Office Holds Tax Revenue Rectification Meeting</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since Li Jihong took office as the Special Commissioner of Finance for the North, in view of the sluggish tax revenue in the province and the difficulty in coping, he urgently considered ways to rectify it. This afternoon (1st) at 3:00 PM, he specially convened the heads of various national tax agencies in the province to hold a meeting to reorganize tax revenue. The representatives present included Li Muqing, Director of the Special Tax Office; Luo Ting, Director of the Stamp Tax Bureau; Xie Fencheng, Director of the Cigarette Tax Bureau; Zhang Zimei, Director of the Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau; Chen Yongqing, Director of the Salt Transport Bureau; Zeng Luda, Director of the Flour Tax Bureau; Tu Zhenhu, Director of the Parcel Post Tax Bureau; Liang Rongsun, Supervisor of the Wuchang Customs; Xi Debing, Supervisor of the Jianghan Customs; Wang Changquan, Director of the Salt Affairs Audit Office; and Wan Yukun, Supervisor of the Xindi Customs, and more than ten others. Li Jihong, as chairman, first gave an opening speech, roughly stating that Hubei Province is located in the center of the country and its commerce is prosperous. In the past, national taxes were known as a surplus area. However, recently, due to the anti-rebellion military campaign and the disturbances of the communist bandits, tax revenue has been declining day by day. Since I was ordered to come to Hubei to preside over tax affairs, I am ashamed of my mediocrity and inability to assume such an important task. However, considering that at this time, when military salaries are huge and government expenses are pressing, since I have accepted the heavy trust of Minister Song, I should try to take on the heavy difficulties and strive to rectify and adjust. I hope that all of you present will take the friendship of fellow passengers and thoroughly discuss this matter to help us get through this difficult time. Next, the attendees took turns to reply, and repeatedly stated the current situation of sluggish tax revenue and the difficulties in handling affairs. Then, they discussed Li's proposal for reorganizing tax revenue. The original proposal roughly stated: After investigating, Hubei Province is located in the center of the country, and Hankou's commerce has always been known to be prosperous. National tax revenue should be more prosperous than other provinces. Since the anti-rebellion military campaign, the communist bandits have caused disturbances in the rear, traffic has been blocked, and commercial transport has been hindered, resulting in a decrease in revenue. All agencies feel the difficulties. However, the Hubei branch treasury should pay 2.51 million yuan for military expenses every month, and about 100,000 yuan for Wuhan University, the Army Survey Bureau, and other government expenses, all of which are fixed amounts and must be disbursed on a monthly basis. My office is responsible for disbursing and remitting national treasury funds, auditing accounts, and planning and reorganizing methods. I, Hongji, was ordered to take over this position. Since the beginning of my appointment, after reviewing the files, I learned that as of now, more than 900,000 yuan is owed in military expenses and more than 100,000 yuan is owed in university expenses. The reason for this is that tax revenue is insufficient for disbursement. At this time, when military salaries are huge and great attention is paid to political training, military, academic, and government expenses cannot be reduced. The only way is to actively reorganize tax revenue. Jihong and the heads of various agencies will take the friendship of fellow passengers and thoroughly study this matter to get through this difficult time, so as to avoid delays. I would like to state my thoughts below: (1) The salaries are to be issued urgently. I would like to ask each agency to estimate the actual revenue in the most recent three months in order to cope with the situation. The Hubei treasury should disburse a total of more than 2.6 million yuan for military and government expenses every month, and military expenses are issued in six installments of more than 400,000 yuan every five days. The amount is huge and the time is urgent, and cannot be delayed. Recently, due to the shortage of funds remitted by various agencies, the arrears have been very large. Jihong was ordered to succeed and was personally instructed by the minister to first raise funds on time and then clear the arrears. I should try to comply with this, but my office does not directly receive funds, and it is impossible to cope with the situation without the joint efforts of all national tax agencies to seek relief. I would like to ask each agency to accurately estimate the actual and reliable revenue in the most recent three months and submit a monthly list to my office so that it can be submitted to the ministry as a confirmed revenue to be used for salaries. (2) Establish an accurate comparison table of tax revenue for national tax agencies in Hubei Province. Previously, the national tax agencies in Hubei Province had a fixed revenue amount. However, in recent years, due to changes in tax rates or changes in collection methods, it has been difficult to implement according to the original comparison in practice. It is difficult to reconcile and assess. I would like to ask each agency to refer to the actual revenue in the 17th, 18th, and 19th years of the Republic [1928, 1929, 1930], combined with the current collection status and local conditions, to separately determine the peak and off-season periods and create an accurate comparison table for reference. This table will be submitted to the ministry for approval and implementation. (3) Each agency should submit a reorganization plan for the tax revenue under its jurisdiction to the ministry for approval. Although Hubei Province's production is not rich, its shipping routes and transportation are convenient, and merchants are densely packed. Since trade is flourishing, tax revenue is increasing day by day. Those who preside over the monopoly administration should first eliminate accumulated malpractices, and then observe the situation, open up tax sources, and increase tax revenue. At this time, when military expenses are huge, this is especially important. However, how to reorganize should be determined by each competent authority based on the current tax situation, and a practical reorganization plan should be prepared and submitted to the ministry for approval and implemented step by step. (4) Each agency's revenue should still be deposited in full in the Central Bank of China on a daily basis in accordance with the ministry's order. Last year, each agency's revenue was instructed by the minister to be deposited in the Central Bank of China. Those who violate this will be treated as fraudulent. The former special commissioner Chen has already sent letters to each agency to follow this procedure. Currently, it is found that the number of deposit accounts in the Central Bank of China for each agency is still small, or some agencies have not deposited all funds on a daily basis. I would like to ask each agency to deposit all tax funds collected in the future in the Central Bank of China on a daily basis in order to comply with the ministry's order and facilitate transfer and reporting. (5) Each agency's daily cash receipts and disbursements statements and daily revenue reports should be sent to my office on a daily basis starting from September 1st for transfer and reporting. The daily cash receipts and disbursements and daily revenue reports of each agency were originally required to be submitted on a daily basis. Currently, many agencies have not been able to follow this procedure, or have submitted them in batches every few days. It is difficult for my office to reconcile and transfer the reports. I would like to ask that starting from September 1st, the original regulations should still be followed and submitted to my office on a daily basis for transfer and reporting. All of the above points were discussed and approved by all attendees. Next, the method of adjusting tax revenue for the next three months was discussed. The salt tax and special tax are the most important sources of tax revenue in Hubei Province. However, the salt tax revenue will be gradually used to repay loans in September, October, and November. Only the Yisha area can collect 250,000 yuan in November. Therefore, we must pay attention to the special tax. Li Muqing, Director of the Special Tax Office, agreed to pay 1 million yuan per month. Li Jihong requested an additional loan of 500,000 yuan to meet urgent needs, limited to three months. Other tax revenue agencies must also strengthen rectification in order to increase revenue. All representatives also agreed. The meeting did not adjourn until 5:00 PM. (August 1st)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Merchants Oppose Relocation of Rice Market</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Anhui Province is known throughout the country for its rice production, and the Wuhu rice market also occupies an important position in domestic commerce. The prosperity or decline of various industries in Wuhu depends on the rice market, and the increase or decrease in Anhui Province's tax revenue also depends on the prosperity or decline of the rice market. Therefore, the Wuhu rice market is no less than the economic center of Anhui Province. In recent years, although the rice market has gradually declined, the depressed market is still maintained. The provincial capital suddenly had a rice market preparation office, intending to move the Wuhu rice market to the capital. People in Anhui had appealed to the government due to the relationship of interests. Unexpectedly, the capital's rice market preparation office has recently been approved and filed. Various industries in Wuhu were greatly panicked by this news. This afternoon at 2:00 PM, various business associations held an emergency meeting at the General Chamber of Commerce and resolved to telegraph the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance and Industry to request the cancellation of this proposal in order to protect the lifeline of Wuhu. The text of the telegram is recorded as follows: (Nanjing respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry) Anhui Province's commerce is centered on the Wuhu rice market. Recently, it was heard that the capital is establishing a rice market preparation office. The news has spread and everyone is panicked and at a loss. Anhui Province is a rice-producing area, and the rice market has been concentrated in Wuhu for a long time. Rice from various counties in southern Anhui is transported to Wuhu by small boats from inland river ports. There is less risk of wind and waves, and it can be sold nearby. If the rice market is moved to the capital, it will have to travel far across the Yangtze River. Who will bear the responsibility for the risks? If we must change the rules, the rice donation will be cut off, there will be no money for education, and scholars will be in trouble. Anhui farmers have limited harvests. A small amount of transportation can be sold for value. Now we are abandoning the near and seeking the far, and the farmers will be in trouble. There are more than 10,000 boatmen, total packaging, and porter workers, and their livelihoods will be cut off. Workers will be in trouble. Merchants in various industries have no rice to transfer, and various businesses will inevitably decline sharply. Merchants will be in trouble. If this policy is implemented, it will not only make the four classes of people in Wuhu suffer, but also harm all counties in Anhui Province. Our Anhui belongs to the central government's protection. How can we bear to see the commercial port become a ruin and not pay attention to it? Moreover, this year's rice famine has resulted in a loss of more than 80,000 yuan for flat rice sales. We have requested the provincial government to compensate with two points of the rice donation. Who will compensate for the loss caused by the relocation of the rice market? At today's meeting, the various business associations were filled with indignation, and they all said that moving the rice market is tantamount to making all merchants unemployed. Therefore, we have described the beginning and end of the matter in detail and urgently implore your office to review and verify it and issue an order to abolish the capital's rice market preparation office in order to preserve the lives of the four classes of people in Anhui. We are eagerly awaiting orders. (August 1st)</p>

<h3>Communist Bandits on Zhejiang Border Will Be Eliminated Soon</h3>
<p>During the incident on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi border, the Fujian bandit He Jinbiao and others colluded with the communist bandits in Wenzhou, hoping to disturb the Zhejiang border. The original defense troops there were few in number. In order to lure the enemy in, they retreated on purpose in order to annihilate them in one fell swoop. Although Taishun was once captured, the provincial government ordered the dispatch of the 5th and 6th Security Regiments and two water police patrol ships to assist in the suppression together with the 4th Regiment stationed in Yongjia. The communist bandits were unable to support themselves and fled in droves. Yesterday, the provincial government received a telegram from Regiment Commander Gan of the 4th Regiment reporting that the 1st, 12th, and part of the 9th companies of the regiment had recovered Taicheng on the 30th, and local order had been completely restored. As for Jinyun, the local garrison was only two platoons of the Security Team because the communist bandits took advantage of the vacancy to disturb the area. They temporarily retreated to Yongkang. Later, the provincial government ordered the dispatch of Zhao Ying of the 7th Regiment to suppress them. The communist bandits were shocked and fled upon hearing the news and withdrew from the city. It is expected that after the troops of the 7th Regiment arrive, they can be completely eliminated. As for the Jiangxi border, since the recovery of Yushan, the defense has become more consolidated. The provincial government has telegraphed the troops entering Jiangxi to stop advancing and properly defend.</p>

However, he soon received another letter from the bandits, suddenly reducing the ransom from 150,000 yuan to 25,000 yuan, and arranging a meeting at a certain inn. Su believed that a negotiation was possible at this time and personally went to the agreed location. However, he was unable to make contact and posted an implied message on the message board. After waiting for two days, no one showed up, so he returned with the money. Only later did he learn that the letter was a forgery by a swindler. Fortunately, Su was not fooled, but the whereabouts of the kidnapped people remain unknown. Yesterday, a hostage who escaped from a bandit den in Da'an Port reported that the Su family hostages are still being held in the bandit den, but in a separate room with only one entrance. Two bandits take turns guarding day and night. Su's wife, children, and the tutor have their faces covered with towels during the day and their feet tightly bound at night, tied together so they cannot move. The children often cry out in pain, and the bandits silence them by burning their arms with lit cigarettes.

After discovering the theft, the thief was reported to the police for investigation. A certain Chinese detective arrested the boatman, who confessed to the theft and pointed out the address and name of the buyer. The jurisdictional authority prepared a document to transfer and interrogate him. He confessed to mistakenly buying stolen goods and was sentenced to compensate for the price of the rice, a fine of 4,000 yuan, and a seven-month prison sentence.

<p>The Second Brigade Cancelled: More than 200 bandits led by Guo Wuleizi in the southwest countryside were previously recruited by former County Magistrate Wang Peishi and organized into the Second Guerrilla Brigade, appointing Zhang Huaikang as the captain. They were ordered to be stationed near Huanghuadun for training. Since Wang's departure, the local government has largely denied them, leading to difficulties in supplying them. Currently, as a certain unit in Lu'an is recruiting soldiers in the western countryside, the brigade has also turned to that unit to pledge allegiance, and negotiations are nearly complete. The Hefei County Government has approved the cancellation of the Second Brigade, and the brigade commander Zhang Huaikang has also been relieved of his post.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter From the Shandong Salt Transport Office</h3>
<p>Our office received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance in June, approving General He's telegram from Xuzhou stating that people on the Shandong border were suffering due to difficulty in selling salt. We were instructed to investigate and respond. We followed orders and sent commissioners to Xuzhou to investigate in detail. We also heard that the Luchang Company had illegal practices that harmed the people. We instructed the commissioners to investigate this matter as well. Subsequently, we received a report from the Xuzhou Inspection Bureau stating that on July 13, the Ji Yu Company transported 5,772 dan of salt that should have been sold in the Guide nine prefectures to the Luchang Company without authorization. They only reported the inspection after unloading the salt, violating the regulations. They were not inspected, detained, and reported for instructions. We also received a report from the commissioner to Xuzhou stating that they learned in Haizhou that a batch of salt from the Ji Yu Company bound for Henan had already been transported and unloaded in Xuzhou. They immediately consulted with the Inspection Bureau and learned that 1,872 dan had been unloaded and handed over to the Luchang Company. They then went to Luchang to inquire and were told that the salt was sealed in the warehouse, but those involved had left and could not be inspected. Suspecting the words were evasive, they went to the warehouse to inspect and found many suspicious points. They immediately sealed it with the Inspection Bureau. On July 13, they went to the Luchang main warehouse to check the accounts and suddenly saw a large amount of salt piled up. When they questioned the manager, they avoided them. After repeated investigations, they learned that this was the second batch of 5,772 dan delivered to Luchang by the Ji Yu Company, and they did not report it for inspection in accordance with the regulations. They immediately telegraphed the Inspection Bureau for instructions. The transporter, knowing that it had been discovered, sent a servant with a permit to request inspection, which was rejected by the Inspection Bureau, stating that the salt had been unloaded privately and could not be inspected. They should wait for instructions and follow them. At the same time, they ordered the Luchang Company to be responsible for the safekeeping. It was found that the Ji Yu Company was approved to sell 10,000 dan in Xuzhou last year, and it had already been transported. Now, when reporting the first batch arriving in Xuzhou, they dared to claim approval for selling in Xuzhou. The second batch was not reported for inspection, but was unloaded privately and piled up in Luchang, which was obviously colluding for illegal sales, and there was no guarantee that there was no private involvement. Salt that had not been approved for sale and violated inspection regulations should be treated as illegal salt according to regulations. The company dared to collude and attempt, which was truly reckless. The recent salt shortage in Xuzhou was indeed true, and it was due to Luchang's inability to raise funds to lead and supply salt, only knowing how to collect private profits. They repeatedly refused to hand over the account books for inspection, and the amount of stored salt was kept secret. Accepting and storing the illegal salt of the Ji Yu Company was also evidence of their private profiteering. According to the salt price regulations, Tongshan was 8.35 cents per catty, but Luchang raised the price to over 1 jiao. Xiaoxian was 8.85 cents per catty, but Luchang raised the price to 1 jiao and 3 li. Small vendors also raised the price to as much as 1 jiao and 5 fen. The salt scale was also short by about 13 taels per catty. All kinds of malpractices caused the people to suffer. The above-mentioned situations were all personally investigated by the official commissioners, who verified the prices, sought opinions, and all agreed. We should first report the details of the investigation to the Salt Department, and ask whether the illegal salt of the Ji Yu Company should be confiscated and fined in accordance with regulations, and how the malpractice of the Luchang Company should be strictly punished according to law. We await your instructions. After receiving the report, we ordered the Luchang Company to suspend business temporarily and await investigation. At the same time, we telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for review, and we immediately received a telegram instructing us to confiscate all the seized salt and to draft a plan for punishing the Luchang Company and submit it for approval. The above is the process of the confiscation of the Ji Yu Company's salt. Afterwards, the company falsely reported to the Ministry of Finance that it was an illegal punishment because it had failed to bribe. General He turned it into the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Finance issued it to our office. The company's illegal actions were unknown, and they turned to slander. The facts were not confused because of this, and the law was responsible. Since the company has published a telegram in the newspaper, it is specially disclosed to clarify the truth.</p>

<h3>Schools Are Not Allowed to Accommodate Outsiders</h3>
<p>The Capital Garrison Command Instructs the Ministry to Relay to its Affiliates</p>
<p>Riri News Beijing Dispatch: The Capital Garrison Command believes that during holidays, schools at all levels often have outsiders lodging in them. At a time when strict precautions are being taken against Communist Party members and other reactionary elements lurking in various places, there is a risk of negligence. Yesterday, the command sent a special letter to the Ministry of Education, requesting that all schools at all levels strictly refuse outsiders to lodge in order to prevent them from becoming havens for reactionary elements. It is reported that the Ministry of Education has prepared to instruct all its affiliates to comply and eliminate reactionary elements.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Orders the Disbandment of the Female Affiliated Middle School of Peiping University</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education received a telegram from the student union of the Female Affiliated Middle School of Peiping University stating that the school opened as scheduled today, with 259 returning students and 89 new students. The Ministry of Education, believing that the school was defying the ministry's orders, telegraphed Peiping University yesterday to investigate and disband the school. The original telegram stated: "Peiping University, we have received your Female Affiliated Middle School's East Telegram stating that the school has been ordered to unconditionally transfer to the Female Normal College before the end of July. If you resist the order, you will be disbanded. We have now received an East Telegram from the school's student union stating that the affiliated school opened as scheduled today. This is obviously defying the ministry's orders. We order you to investigate and disband the school. Ministry of Education, Winter Seal."</p>
<h3>Professor Renor's Mission to China</h3>
<p>To Make New Contributions to the Economy of the New China Era</p>
<p>Arriving in China on the Russian Empress, Expected to Arrive at Port Tomorrow</p>
<p>(China Foreign News International News) In recent years, foreigners studying Oriental issues have paid special attention to economic and commercial aspects. For example, Adans's study of railway accounting in our country, Johnson's investigation of transportation issues, and our government's hiring of foreign experts are not uncommon. For example, the hiring of Jingqi and Huishilin during the late Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the Kemal Design Committee in recent times.</p>
<p>Among the guest professors, apart from Adans, Professor Renor has made considerable contributions to the academic world in our country. His books, such as Lectures on China's International Trade Economy, have had a great impact on the economic circles in our country. This time, in addition to studying China's international finance and economy, he will also visit major commercial ports in our country. This trip is commissioned by the New York Institute of Social Sciences and the Advisory Committee of the Brookings Institution (Washington). It has been two years since the Institute of Social Sciences passed his proposal in the summer of the 17th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Last year's Pacific National Conference in Nishikyo, Japan, devoted a major part of its program to the issue of foreign investment in China. At that time, the various reports on this category included the following:</p>
<p>Foreign Investment in China: Liu Dajun</p>
<p>British Investment in China: Committee of the Royal Institute of International Affairs</p>
<p>Japanese Investment in China: Ri Wotian Jue</p>
<p>French and German Investment in China: Professor Elice (University of Michigan)</p>
<p>American Investment in China: Professor Renor</p>
<p>Comparing the number of investments in China by various powers, there are discrepancies. Therefore, correcting these differences is also an important issue in the future. As a result, the total amount of investment in China by the powers will be accurate. The important part of the total includes the national debt of the national government. This issue was paid attention to by the Kemal Design Committee last year, and Professor Kai's investigation made the total amount of national debt of the national government clearer.</p>
<p>Professor Lei's research has shown that the direct investment in China by foreign stores far exceeds the national debt of the national government, and the amount may be several times greater. It is extremely difficult to calculate this type of direct investment. Therefore, the importance of foreign direct investment and the results of investment in China by the powers is obvious. In addition, the impact of foreign investment in China on our people's economic, political, and social life is also a key point of this research. Moreover, attention is also paid to our country's economic system under the treaty port system and extraterritoriality.</p>
<p>In addition, the amount of investment in the country by overseas Chinese in Nanyang is also a topic of research for the professor. Unfortunately, the remittance system is simple and there is no way to start the investigation. The banks in Shanghai are also unwilling to show their internal situation to others. It is heard that the National Jinan University in West Shanghai has established a South Ocean and American Cultural Business Department. The person in charge is deeply aware of the overseas Chinese situation and may be able to help.</p>
<p>Professor Lei will arrive in Shanghai on the Russian Empress on September 5th. Several young economists will come with him.</p>

After the Ministry's review, prominent figures from the Party and the nation will be invited to evaluate and announce the evaluation results in September of the 19th year. However, it is reported that although there are 700 submissions, very few are of high quality, and there is talk of extending the submission period and announcing the results later.</p>
<h3>News on Phonetic Symbol Training in Capital Government Agencies</h3>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Reopening of Quanzhou-Zhangzhou Middle School</h3>
<p>Approved by the Municipal Government Yesterday</p>
<p>And Ordered the School to Thoroughly Rectify</p>
<p>The Daily News reports that the Quanzhou-Zhangzhou Middle School on Longhua Road in this city was sealed up more than a year ago because students were propagating reactionary ideas. It is now reported that the school's board of directors has decided to continue operating the school and to thoroughly rectify it. Yesterday, they appointed representatives, including Zhuang Yizhong, to petition the Municipal Government to allow the school to reopen. Yesterday, the Municipal Government approved the reopening, stating that the school site is originally the property of the guild hall. Since the appointed representatives have requested the reopening, it should be approved. However, the school was previously sealed because the students' propagation of reactionary ideas was a serious offense. Now that it is proposed to reopen, the school should immediately adhere to the methods instructed by the Education Bureau, properly reorganize, and thoroughly rectify the school. In addition to ordering the Public Security and Education Bureaus, the school must comply with these instructions.</p>
<h3>Internal Reforms at Soochow University Law School</h3>
<p>Since Dr. Wu Jingxiong and Dr. Sheng Zhenwei became presidents of the Soochow University Law School on Kunshan Road, they have made more reforms internally in order to suit the study of law based on individual aptitude and talent, especially in the area of Chinese law. It is reported that the first entrance examination for new students this autumn was held at the school on September 2nd. Among the new students, in addition to transfer students from the Soochow Law Preparatory School and undergraduate students in Suzhou, most are graduates from famous universities in China, and there are also several who have returned from studying abroad. However, recently, some students from other cities have requested another opportunity because they were unable to arrive in time. In consideration of their eagerness to study, the school has scheduled another entrance examination on September 20th. As for the faculty, professors such as Dong Kang, Sa Laide, Zheng Tianxi, Liu Shifang, and Zhu Zhirang will continue to teach, and several others have been newly hired, including the Mexican Consul, Aroemando. President Wu Jingxiong will also continue to teach after returning to China.</p>
<h3>Renovation of the Shanghai Art College</h3>
<p>Since the selection of a large open space in front of the Tiantong'an Railway Station on Zhabei Wan Road to build a magnificent school building, it has been gradually completed recently.

In the Music Department, in addition to the Director of Studies, Shen Jilu, serving concurrently, and Tan Shuzhen, a former member of the school's basic committee, serving as a professor of violin, You Wenmo and Yu Yuezhang have also been newly hired to serve as piano professors.</p>
<h3>Vocational Education Society Cultivates Talents for Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>Recently, the China Vocational Education Society has been meeting the needs of municipal organizations and the business community for clerical personnel. For example, the clerical workers and Chinese typists used by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance, Bureau of Social Affairs, Bureau of Public Safety, Bureau of Public Works, Bureau of Public Utilities, Bank of China, and Shanghai Bank are all graduates of the Society's night school. Therefore, the Society is continuing to offer a special course in clerical work, which focuses on Chinese typing in addition to clerical work, file management, statistics, and shorthand. Mr. Song Mingde, director of the Chinese Typing Department of the Commercial Press, will continue to be in charge of teaching. In addition, in order to meet the needs of various organizations that entrust the Society to find personnel, who must be proficient in daily English, and to facilitate the supplementary study of service personnel in various organizations, a daily English course has been added. Furthermore, after the Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued the outline of the worker education plan, all factories must carry out worker education but are worried about the lack of teachers. The Society has therefore established a teacher training program for worker education, focusing on worker education facilities, teaching methods, factory equipment and safety, scientific management, and industrial and commercial laws. The Society has sent letters to the Shanghai Machinery National Goods Factory Federation, notifying the factories to send factory employees to the school for study. Currently, enrollments in all courses are extremely enthusiastic and will soon be full. The entrance examination is scheduled to be held on the 7th of this month.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Telecommunications School to Open</h3>

All students in each class have been notified to arrive at the school on time in accordance with the regulations. It is reported that the teachers have also arrived at the school one after another recently.</p>

<h3>China and Japan Scheduled to Hold Preliminary Round of Davis Cup Today</h3>
<p>The preliminary round of the International Davis Cup doubles match of the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club, originally scheduled to be played between China and Japan on the 2nd, was changed to 4:00 PM today at the China Tennis Courts after the doubles teams agreed. The Chinese representatives are Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai, and the Japanese representatives are expected to be Machida and other first-class players. It will be a spectacular display of skill. However, due to the heavy rain yesterday, it is still uncertain whether it will be held today.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Wins the Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup</h3>
<p>Defeats Tianma Four to One Last Night</p>
<p>Last night at 8:00 PM, the final of the Guangdong-Hong Kong Table Tennis Cup was held between the Guangdong and Tianma table tennis teams at the Gimdrew Gymnasium. More than 600 spectators watched from the sidelines, making it an unprecedentedly lively event in Shanghai's table tennis circles. The most important part of the match was specially supervised by Mr. Ikeda as the referee and Mr. Yu Binqi as the inspector. As a result, Guangdong won the championship. The results are recorded below:</p>
<p>Guangdong Tianma Result Winner</p>
<p>Luo Hongsheng Lu Hanjun 3-0 Guangdong</p>
<p>Deng Guofu Ma Tingliang 3-0 Guangdong</p>
<p>Lu Zhongqiu Sun Jianqu 3-0 Guangdong</p>
<p>Huang Anbang Lu Shentong 1-3 Tianma</p>
<p>Huang Xiangfa Zhu Guisheng 3-0 Guangdong</p>
<p>Commentary on the Skills: Luo Hongsheng vs. Lu Hanjun: Mr. Luo is a veteran with long experience, having attended the Far Eastern Games. He is good at defense and precise strokes. Mr. Lu is a young and handsome man who is brave and good at fighting. Although his offense and defense are appropriate, he lacks experience, which led to his defeat. Deng Guofu is a newly emerging talent, but he is diligent in practice and his strokes are powerful. Although Ma has been on the battlefield for a long time and is good at defending, he was unable to cope with the attacks and was defeated. Lu Zhongqiu is an athlete who attended the Far Eastern Games and defeated Morita of Japan. He has excellent technique, is good at counterattacks, and injects when he sees an opportunity. Although Mr. Sun actively resisted, he was eventually defeated due to lack of time to care for all areas. Huang Anbang is one of the new generals, with precise strokes. Lu Shentong is excellent in both long-range and close-range attacks, and his technique is superior. The audience was most excited and he won against Huang by a score of three to one. Huang Xiangfa is a representative to the Far Eastern Games for the second time and is the most experienced among the competitors, with the best defense. Although Zhu is good at strokes and defense, he eventually found it difficult to cope. He used strokes, which were exceptionally powerful, and Huang sometimes could not cope, but Zhu often committed suicide. Huang was more stable, so the victory belonged to Huang.</p>
<p>Awards Ceremony: After the competition, Mr. Zeng Yingfu, the captain of the Hong Kong team, moved the Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup to the table. Yu Binqi translated, saying that the Hong Kong team was warmly received by all sectors in Shanghai, and they were grateful for the enthusiastic ticket purchases and seats. He presented the cup to Mr. Xu, the president of the Guangdong Table Tennis Association.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Gimdrew Billiards Association</h3>
<p>The Gimdrew Billiards Association was formed by famous players in Shanghai and has existed for six or seven years. It has many members and excellent results, winning the Tongshang Cup championship for the 5th, 6th, and 7th sessions, and the Xiangbin Cup championship for the 2nd session, reigning supreme in Shanghai. Recently, due to the revival of the Guangdong Table Tennis Association, many Guangdong members have left. Therefore, there was a meeting to reorganize the association. As a result of the election the night before, Lu Xiulu was elected as the captain, Lu Zhongqiu as the vice-captain, Hu Jianhan as the secretary, and Wang Xiawen and Zhou Jianwen as the directors. Players such as Zhang Yongren, Wang Bohong, Li Fushu, Hua Yihong, Guo Fuhai, and Xi Qiaosheng are all experts in their own right, so the strength is still very substantial.</p>
<h3>Japanese Student Expeditionary Force to Return Home</h3>
<p>Warsaw, 2nd (Jiji News Agency) - The Japanese student expeditionary force's land competition against Poland began at 3:00 PM today, with the Japanese side taking the lead. It is scheduled to depart from Warsaw on the 3rd and return east via Siberia.</p>
<h3>Sports Weekly is About to be Launched</h3>
<p>Recently, Mr. Ge Bai, the former sports news editor of the Continental Daily, and Mr. Yang Ruinian, a field reporter, have jointly edited an English sports publication called Sporting Times, which is published every Wednesday. The content is novel, covering everything from horse racing, fencing, swimming, and ball games to various recreational activities. At the end, a film column is added to the sports section. In addition to news, there is a weekly summary and review, such as a detailed description of Jai Alai. In the film section, both Chinese and foreign films are reviewed. The excellent printing quality and concise language are also worth mentioning. In addition, Mr. Chen Gaocong, a business tycoon who is in charge of office affairs and loves sports, as well as those who enjoy watching movies, should have a copy in hand.</p>
<h3>Record of Watching the Three Major Japanese Tennis Championships</h3>
<p>All Japan Students... Junior... Women's Three Types</p>
<p>Rewards are Effective | Talents Emerge | Our Country Should Strive</p>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) The three major championships sponsored by the Japan Tennis Association were held successively at Koshien from August 20th to 27th. All the leading players in the student world participated to compete for glory, and new capable players also enthusiastically signed up to seek opportunities to climb the dragon gate. Except for the women's competition, the number of entries exceeded those of Europe and the United States. There were 128 entries for the student singles competition, more than 30 groups for the doubles competition, 80 entries for the junior singles competition, about 30 groups for the doubles competition, 16 entries for the women's singles competition, and only 8 groups for the doubles competition. Compared with Mr. Liao Jizhi's tennis world in our country, there is a world of difference. Moreover, the competition started continuously at 9:00 AM under the scorching sun for eight days, and the players all maintained their spirit from beginning to end. Their fierce spirit is admirable. It is no wonder that the island nation produces new tennis players every year and dominates East Asia, flying overseas. The reason for this is nothing more than the efforts to popularize the sport and the fact that the organizers provide effective rewards. If the people in our country who care about this skill do not wake up and strive hard, then there is absolutely no hope of winning the tennis championship at the next Far Eastern Games. Now, the viewing art reviews of the important competitions are compiled as follows:</p>

<h3>(4) Viewing Impressions and Skill Criticism</h3>
<p>Ms. Toda once represented Japan at the 6th Far Eastern Games. Although she is an old hand, her fighting spirit is no longer as strong as in previous years. Kobayashi is a rising star whose skills are advancing rapidly. Her hitting style is almost masculine. She overcame the two Li sisters of our country effortlessly at the 9th Far Eastern Games and is now the number one woman in Japan, so her victory was expected. However, in the doubles, she suddenly pulled Hayashi, and the cooperation was not good, resulting in a setback against the skillful Toda Masuda team.</p>
<p>The qualification for the junior level is based on those under the age of 19. Therefore, middle school players have to compete with the rising stars of universities and high schools. Therefore, Kojima, who visited Shanghai on an expedition, has no one to rival him. However, in the final, his opponent Hirai's skills were by no means weak. The first set was extremely exciting, and the strengths were equal. In the second set, Hirai lacked composure and made many mistakes. In the third set, he took advantage of Kojima's arrogance and complacency to launch a counterattack, which was successful, causing Kojima to get a duck egg. Therefore, his morale was strong in the final fourth set. You came and I went, and it was difficult to tell who was better. He once took the lead with a score of five to four, which was quite advantageous. Unfortunately, he was too eager to win and missed a key point. Kojima tried hard to defend and desperately tried to block the attack, and finally won the championship with a score of three to one. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Circulation of Rice and Grain from Various Provinces</h3>
<p>Good News for the People's Food Problem</p>
<p>Jiangxi Rice Also Lifted: The Jiangxi Provincial Government believes that this year's harvest in Jiangxi Province is very abundant. In addition to supplying the people's food in the province, there is surplus rice that can be exported. It was decided to follow the example of Hunan rice leaving the country. From September 1st, Jiangxi rice will also be allowed to be purchased by other provinces, with Jiujiang as the port for transit and exit. Rice merchants in Shanghai have already sent telegrams to Jiangxi to purchase and transport rice. A large batch of Jiangxi rice will arrive in Shanghai next week.</p>
<p>Hunan Rice Continues to Arrive: Since the lifting of the ban on Hunan rice, many batches have arrived in Shanghai. In the past two days, batches continued to be loaded from Changsha to Hankou and transferred to Shanghai, totaling two batches, one with 800 bags and one with 3,097 bags. Yesterday, they were all unloaded in this city, one stored in the Hongkou godown and one unloaded in Puxi. It is reported that there are still more than 10,000 bags that will be imported in the next few days.</p>
<p>No Obstruction to Rice Leaving Tianjin: Tianjin has come to Shanghai to purchase rice, but the Jianghai Customs has banned transportation for two weeks. Subsequently, due to the issue of people's food and the fact that most of the rice purchased was foreign rice, the ban was lifted. Recently, there has been no obstruction to the transportation of rice and grain from Shanghai to Tianjin. Local Chinese steamships are all loading.</p>
<h3>The Impending Sino-Japanese Telecommunications Negotiations</h3>
<p>News From the Japanese Side</p>
<p>Regarding the Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiations, the diplomatic authorities of the two countries have officially appointed the negotiators, and all the procedures have been agreed upon by the Japanese Acting Minister Chong Guang Kui and Foreign Minister Wang. Therefore, formal negotiations can begin soon. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited the Japanese Embassy office yesterday and obtained the following news:</p>
<p>Japanese Negotiators: The Japanese government attaches great importance to these telecommunications negotiations. In addition to appointing Acting Minister Chong Guang Kui as the chairman of the committee to take overall charge, the Director of the Savings Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, Yoshino Keizo, has also been appointed as a specialist committee member. Mr. Yoshino once served as the Chief of the Overseas Telecommunications Section of the Ministry of Communications and is the foremost expert in Japan on overseas telecommunications. It has now been confirmed that he will come to Shanghai on the 10th of this month. The Japanese government yesterday also ordered the Secretary of the Ministry of Communications, Iino Takeo, to be the Secretary-General, and Mori Kanji and Makabe Sanzaburo of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be secretaries. They will all come to Shanghai on the same ship with Director Yoshino on the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>Scope of Negotiations: According to an investigation, in addition to the submarine cable from Shanghai to Nagasaki, the Japanese have established several telegraph lines in China, including Fuzhou-Taiwan, Dalian-Zhifu, and Dalian-Guozheng Island. These are all submarine cables, and the Chinese and Japanese governments have treaties with each other. Therefore, the scope of future negotiations will be based on the above lines.</p>
<p>Prospects for Negotiations: According to news from the Japanese side, the National Government's communications authorities are eager to recover the telecommunications established by foreigners in China. Foreign Minister Wang and Communications Minister Wang have repeatedly held informal discussions and private meetings with the Japanese Acting Minister Chong Guang Kui. Although they have come close, the Japanese government's planned plan is quite different from the National Government's opinion. Therefore, there will inevitably be many twists and turns after the negotiations begin. Although the treaty may be revised, it is difficult to predict the date of the establishment of a new treaty.</p>
<p>Date of Commencement of Negotiations: Chong Guang Kui told a reporter from the Guowen News Agency yesterday that Director Yoshino has been scheduled to come to Shanghai around the 10th of this month and will arrive in Shanghai by the 15th at the latest. The Chinese Ministry of Communications authorities have also prepared all the procedures. Therefore, the formal negotiation meeting will be held by the 20th of this month at the latest. The meeting place will be in the capital, and I will personally go to Beijing for the meeting at that time.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Sojourning Hunanese Send Telegram to Encourage Hunan Generals</h3>
<p>To Chairman He in Changsha and to all the generals in Hunan, may you all know: The provincial capital is the area where the cultural essence of the entire province gathers, and the lives and property of tens of millions of people depend on it. Last time, due to ineffective suppression, the sparks were allowed to spread. Communist bandits gathered in the provincial capital, killing, arson, and piling up corpses into mounds, and blood flowing into canals. The cultural essence was almost completely lost. Looking back to our hometown, we cannot help but sigh. The blood of the provincial capital has not yet dried, and the bad news from the front line is coming again. The false name is used to shorten the front line and fight in the suburbs. Our association has been entrusted by fellow villagers and is concerned about the impending disaster in our hometown. The situation is critical and we cannot remain silent. We hope that you will focus on our homeland, bravely kill the bandits, and leave their bodies behind, in order to atone for the previous sins and prevent the desolate Xing Sha from suffering another catastrophe. The people who survived the nine deaths are in a desperate situation. The interests of the three Xiang and seven Zei really depend on it. Otherwise, even if we don't kill Bo Ren, Bo Ren will die because of us. We ask ourselves and ask what we will do to the people of Hunan. The laws of the country are clear, and what tolerance will there be? We respectfully send this telegram and hope that you will consider it. We also wish you all the best. The Shanghai Sojourning Hunanese Save Hunan Association.</p>

<h3>Yesterday Evening Reception for Postal Staff by the Press</h3>
<p>Reasons for Opposing the Establishment of a Separate Bureau for Postal Savings and Remittances</p>
<p>Report on the Resolution of Ten Outstanding Issues</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Employees' Union hosted a banquet for reporters from various newspapers at the Central Western Restaurant yesterday. Dozens of reporters from various newspapers attended. During the banquet, representatives from both unions reported on the reasons for opposing the establishment of a separate bureau for postal savings and remittances, as well as the various acts of greed, corruption, and destruction of the postal system by Liu Shufan, the Director of the Postal Department of the Ministry of Communications and concurrently the Director-General of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau.</p>
<p>They stated that the postal savings and remittance business has always been handled by the post office. Since Liu Shufan went abroad for inspection last year and returned to China in August, he has gained nothing but arranged for a large number of private individuals to be placed in positions, and at the expense of dividing the postal service, he has established a separate bureau to handle the savings and remittance business. Since the establishment of this redundant agency, the postal budget has increased by six million yuan. The facts of his disrupting the postal organization, disturbing the governance, and destroying the regulations are truly heartbreaking to speak of.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for Liu's desire to establish a separate bureau for the savings and remittance business is nothing more than imitating the practices of various countries, saying that European countries all manage postal savings and remittance affairs separately from other postal matters, and Japan also adopted this system early on. In fact, the postal organization systems of various countries are completely different from what Liu said. Those of us who know a little about the current postal situation in Britain, the United States, and Japan all believe that Liu's statement is unfounded. The documents submitted by the two unions to the Central Party Headquarters and various ministries and departments detail the postal situation in various countries.</p>
<p>The purpose of savings and remittances is to promote thrift, not to be similar to private commercial banks, and since the establishment of the Savings and Remittances Bureau, the so-called new policies it boasts of are all similar to what ordinary banks have already done well, and as a result, it has only led to a decline in business. Moreover, the bureau's external credit is guaranteed by the post office. Since the post office is already providing the guarantee, it can be handled by the post office. Why is it necessary to establish a separate bureau, wasting huge sums of money, seemingly separating but not separating, and what is the intention? It is self-evident. In short, based on all the facts, the savings and remittance business cannot be developed and the public's trust cannot be strengthened unless it is merged with the post office. This is a brief reason why the Savings and Remittances Bureau should be merged with the post office.</p>
<p>As for Liu Shufan's crimes of greed, corruption, and destruction of the postal system, let's cite a few of the most obvious ones: (1) Destroying the Postal Association, which planned to recover postal rights in the first year of the Republic of China; (2) Repeated speculation during the Longtan battle the year before last; (3) Causing labor unrest in the seventeenth year, instigating the police to strip the mail carriers of their national uniforms, and sowing discord to undermine the two unions; (4) Not uttering a word at the International Postal Union meeting in London last year, losing national dignity and returning; (5) Taking advantage of his promotion to Director-General to dismiss himself, using fraudulent means to embezzle 120,000 yuan of public funds; (6) Spending tens of thousands of yuan of public funds on repairs to his private residence; (7) Destroying the postal examination system, appointing private individuals who have not passed the old examination, and turning the Savings and Remittances Bureau into his personal enterprise, with all personnel being either relatives of Liu or fathers, sons, brothers, uncles, and nephews; (8) Other acts such as controlling the postal service, destroying the postal system, forming factions for personal gain, and excluding dissidents are too numerous to mention. In short, Liu's lifelong behavior has been greedy and despicable. His past history has been nothing more than flattering foreigners to gain merit. Recent facts show that petty people are triumphant, wielding great power alone to create a postal system for one family and one faction, in order to achieve his conspiracy to control the postal service.</p>
<p>The two unions have submitted documents to the Central Party Headquarters and various ministries and departments, appealing for fair handling, and it is heard that the Central Political Conference has handed it over to the Economic Group for review. Furthermore, the ten demands of the two unions were resolved last month. These demands are all extremely legitimate and are not unreasonable demands or ulterior motives. The smooth resolution and the understanding of the staff and workers of the difficulties of the authorities can be seen as true, they said.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Shanghai Postal Employees' Union submitted another document to the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan regarding the abolition of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, stating that the establishment of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau was inappropriate based on the systems of various countries and the current methods, and there is no reason for its existence.</p>
<p>The staff and unions have already submitted a case against the separate establishment of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau. However, there are still some things that have not been fully stated in the previous submission, so we dare to reiterate them below.</p>
<p>It is found that the current Director of the Postal Department, Liu Shufan, went abroad for inspection for eight months and gained nothing, but arranged for a large number of private individuals to be placed in positions, and at the expense of suggesting the establishment of this redundant agency, and the biggest reason for it is nothing more than (imitating the practices of various countries), so there are statements such as (European countries all manage postal savings and remittance affairs separately from other postal matters, and Japan also adopted this system early on). However, it is known that the postal organization systems of various countries are completely different from what Liu said. According to the latest promulgated postal regulations of various countries and the current postal organization status of various countries printed by the London International Postal Union, there is no such thing. Let's take the current situation in Britain, the United States, and Japan as an example. The British postal service was established the earliest, and the United States and Japan have imitated it in many ways. Other countries need not be mentioned. The British Postmaster General is in charge of everything, and there are various secretaries under him, each managing the affairs under his jurisdiction, such as postal lotus telegrams, remittances, personnel, etc., each is handled separately, and there is also an Accountant General who is in charge of finance and implements the spirit of accounting independence, and all financial and economic accounting matters are under his full authority. As for postal savings, it is only one of the matters he handles.</p>
<p>Under the Postmaster General of the United States, there are four Assistant Postmaster Generals, and under each Assistant Postmaster General, there are various divisions, and the Savings Division and the Remittance Division, together with the Finance Division, the Stamp Division, and the Registered Mail Division, are all under the third Assistant Postmaster General. As for the Japanese postal system, it is all imitated from Britain and the United States and there is nothing special. The Japanese Ministry of Communications (also known as Postmaster General in English) has various bureaus under it, but although their names are bureaus, they are actually no different from the departments of Britain and the United States. From the above, it can be seen that the two items of savings and remittances are both subordinate to the Postmaster General. The so-called separate management refers to separate offices and divisions for special management. This system was originally the case in our country. Moreover, the savings and remittance business in Britain, the United States, and Japan is developed, which cannot be compared with our country, and there is no separate bureau and large-scale extravagance. Liu Shufan erased the facts and fabricated words to deceive, which not only confused the postal service but also made friendly countries laugh. Some people say that the position of the Postmaster General in Britain and the United States is almost equal to the position of the Minister of Communications in our country, so the Postmaster General of our country and the Director-General of Savings and Remittances may as well be under the Minister of Communications.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>In fact, this is a big mistake. It must be known that although the position of the Postmaster General in Britain, the United States, and Japan is raised as much as possible and is equal to a cabinet member, there is no special official in charge of postal affairs under the Postmaster General, and the part that manages the savings and remittance business, no matter how developed its business is, is ultimately subordinate to the Postmaster General and cannot be on par with the Postmaster General. This is another fact that proves that Liu Shufan's absurd remarks are self-defeating. This is also a reason why, based on the systems of various countries, the savings and remittance business should still be handled by the post office.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the purpose of postal savings and remittances in various countries is to promote thrift and facilitate the people, especially to restrict people's savings in the post office reserves as much as possible. Let's cite a passage from Chapter 6 of the British Postal Regulations: The purpose of the national establishment of postal savings is to set up a savings institution to promote thrift, not to collect current deposits. If an account is opened for a minor, or the purpose of opening the account is different from the original intention of establishing postal savings, the Accountant General has the right to cancel it.) It is true that the needs and purposes of postal savings and remittances are completely different from those of national banks. If it is to increase deposits, and no effort is spared to attract customers, wouldn't there be a conflict with the country's central bank? The main reason why Liu Shufan suggested the establishment of the Savings and Remittances Bureau is that the savings and remittances handled by the post office were not developed before, and it is necessary to establish a separate bureau. According to the domestic national conditions and foreign precedents, it is exactly the opposite. Let's divide the two into two parts. One is what other countries do not have, but we brazenly implement it. The purpose of postal savings and remittances is to promote thrift and facilitate the people. The policies adopted are different from those of the national central bank and even more unlike private commercial banks. The so-called new policies of the Savings and Remittances Bureau are to increase current deposits (using checks) and fixed deposits (more than several years), which is contrary to the principles of postal savings.</p>
<p>The second is what other countries have, but we cannot implement. Liu Shufan boasts that the clearing item has not yet been held, so it is added as one of the new policies. In fact, if we examine our country's commercial habits, each store settles accounts only at the end of the year, which is not as good as foreign merchants who implement clearing. If you want the clearing to be developed, this time is not yet right in China. Even in major trading ports, various banks have already done it better. Moreover, according to the actual operation of the postal savings business, it is absolutely different from ordinary banks. Most of the money received by ordinary banks is invested locally, which can avoid the depreciation of clearing, while the money from postal savings must be remitted to the special bureau. For example, in Guangdong Province postal savings, there are many local deposits, but there are no investment opportunities locally. If you remit money out, the remittance rate is surprisingly high, so the interest rate is reduced to 3.6% (the rest are 4.5%). However, it is still considered too much, so new accounts are closed. This refers to Guangdong double silver coins. The currency system is not unified in various places, so the silver prices are different in various places, and the root cause of the underdeveloped savings and remittance business lies in this. It is not only gratifying to increase the number of deposits. This is the second reason why the purpose is wrong.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the annual budget expenditure of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau must be as high as 6 million yuan. If the income from deposits is invested to generate profits, in addition to paying interest to depositors, if each yuan can get a net profit of 3%, there must be at least 200 million yuan in deposits to make up for this huge amount of expenditure. However, the actual deposits, the total amount in the country, is only 10 million yuan. Moreover, it is very important to note that the 6 million yuan in the bureau's budget only refers to all the expenses of the bureau, while the salaries and other expenses of the postal staff in various bureaus across the country who handle the savings and remittance business are not included. If it is actually calculated, it must be more than doubled, which will exceed 400 million yuan. Considering the domestic economic situation, with years of war, floods, and droughts, such a huge amount of deposits is definitely impossible and need not be discussed. The Shanghai banks are extremely frugal in their expenses. For example, the Jin Cheng Bank only spends 2,000 yuan per month excluding rent, while the Savings and Remittances Bureau leases office buildings from the accumulated surplus company, which is still contracted by the post office, with hundreds of taels per month. Other section chiefs and other staff are numerous and the expenses are huge. If it is merged into the post office, this 6 million expenditure can be saved. This is the third reason why the savings and remittances should be merged into the post office in terms of huge expenditure.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the bureau's current external credit has become a bank with no capital, because the post office handles savings and remittances, and the postal assets and other income of the post office serve as collateral, so the credit is strong, while the Savings and Remittances Bureau has no assets and only uses the post office as collateral, and also includes the budget settlement into the postal budget settlement. Since it is clear that it is attached to the post office, it can be directly merged into the post office. Wouldn't it be straightforward, and it must be seemingly separate but not separate, and the intention is already unpredictable. This is the fourth reason why the savings and remittance business should be merged into the post office in terms of external credit.</p>
<p>To sum up the above four points, these are all the reasons why the postal savings and remittance business should not be established as a separate bureau, and the reasons why it cannot be established as a separate bureau. It is reasonable to continue to prepare a document and submit it to your office for review, and to quickly reject the bureau's regulations, which is really for public convenience. Sincerely presented,</p>
<h3>Liu Shufan Submitted His Resignation Yesterday</h3>
<p>Requesting to be Dismissed from All Concurrent Positions</p>
<p>Liu Shufan, Director of the Postal Department of the Ministry of Communications and concurrently Director-General of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, submitted his resignation to the Ministry of Communications because of misunderstandings and criticisms from the outside world. The original text of his resignation, which was submitted yesterday, is as follows:</p>
<p>Submitting this document to express my sincerity and request that you forward it to request dismissal from all my concurrent positions. I, Shufan, was summoned to Beijing in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China while serving as the Postal Director of Anhui to reorganize postal affairs. At that time, military affairs were flourishing, the political situation was precarious, and labor unrest was surging. The postal service, which had a complete system, was also facing a crisis and was in danger of being destroyed. I, Shufan, obeyed the instructions of the superiors and worked diligently for the public, with the original intention of cherishing the post office and maintaining the general work in a dangerous situation. Relying on your virtue and power, it was fortunate that postal transportation and military transportation to the front lines were not affected before the Northern Expedition was completed. However, at that time, Beiping had not yet fallen, and all postal power and its entire economy, as well as postal ticket files, etc., were still under the control of the foreign Director-General of the Northern Bureau. Although the negotiations had been agreed upon, the implementation was still difficult. It was not until the recovery of Pingjin and the completion of unification that the power of the foreigners who had controlled the postal service for decades was completely recovered and returned to the control of our government. Then, plans were made in advance, such as streamlining redundant personnel, saving waste, improving treatment, and expanding postal services. These major points were gradually implemented, all relying on your long-term plans to achieve good results. In March of the eighteenth year, I, Shufan, was ordered to attend the International Postal Conference and inspect postal affairs in various countries. I originally intended to complete the mission and retreat to the path of virtuousness to relieve the burden. However, after returning to the country, I tried to resign but was unable to do so and returned to my original position as Director of the Postal Department. Therefore, based on what I learned from the inspection, I selected the most effective and practical matters that are most needed and useful for our country, such as savings and remittance matters, and reported them to the superiors. I was honored to be adopted and was immediately commissioned to plan the establishment of a special bureau for savings and remittances in accordance with the practices of various countries to benefit the people's livelihood. I immediately drafted regulations, which were submitted by the ministry to the National Government for approval and promulgation, and ordered to be implemented. At the same time, I was also ordered to be appointed as the Acting Director-General of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau. I, with my humble talent, was repeatedly honored and dared not fail to work hard. However, I have been serving the postal service for 32 years and my mind and body are exhausted, so I have never released my desire to retire. Since the opening of the bureau on March 15, only five months have passed. The expansion of the bureaus has reached more than a hundred places. Various savings deposits have increased by several million yuan, and the results are not bad. The booklets and reports are sufficient to prove this. If military affairs are resolved and the overall situation is stabilized, then business prosperity can be guaranteed. In addition, I was ordered to improve the postal system and revise the postal districts, all of which are intended to unify authority, save national funds, and never have any prejudices. Those who do not know recognize it as seizing power for themselves. I do not know that I have exhausted all my efforts to explain clearly, see the new chapter implemented in the morning, and retreat in the evening. The resting place is there, how can I break my promise? Now that I have been away from the post office for two years, this labor unrest has even implicated me. The main reasons are nothing more than two points. One is that the reorganization of the labor union is suspected to be advocated by me, and the other is that the request for salaries and allowances is also suspected to be obstructed by me. The labor unions have this drastic action at the juncture of survival and interests. How does I, Shufan, advocate that the reorganization is under the control of the central government? You know it very well, and there is no need to elaborate. As for the salary issue, it is entirely a misunderstanding. What is even more strange is that the northern newspapers actually said that I, Shufan, withdrew 20 million yuan of postal funds and 2 million yuan of pension funds to contribute to the government as war expenses. The intention is even more heartbreaking. In short, various misunderstandings are all caused by the lack of sincerity and trust on weekdays and the lack of knowledge of the truth, which makes oneself a target of arrows. Thinking over and over again, it is better to give way to the virtuous today than to be blamed in the future. Furthermore, since July 10, I have suffered from a brain disease for two months and have not yet recovered. If I continue to support it reluctantly, both public and private affairs will not be cured. There is no other way. I express my sincerity and pray for your review and approval, and request that you forward it to request dismissal from the positions of Director of the Postal Department and Acting Director-General of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, so that I can recuperate in time and avoid mistakes. I am infinitely grateful and cannot express my obedience. Sincerely present to the Minister and Vice Minister.</p>
<h3>Telegram Ordering Prompt Issuance of Ship Rentals</h3>
<p>Telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang to the Shipping Industry Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang yesterday, which read: The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association acknowledges your telegram. Regarding your request for the prompt issuance of ship rentals to various companies, I have telegraphed the rear manager and transportation departments to investigate and handle the case. Special reply, Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, winter seal.</p>
<h3>Publication of British Ship Registry</h3>
<p>33,000 Steamships and Sailing Ships Worldwide. The Zi Lin Bao reports that the 1930-31 annual ship registry of the British Lloyd's Ship Registry Committee has been published and arrived in Shanghai. According to the report, there are approximately 33,000 steam and fuel oil ships and sailing ships over 100 tons worldwide, and a total of 21,000 companies related to shipping. In the one-year period from June 1929 to June 1930, steam merchant ships increased by 148,176 tons, fuel oil merchant ships increased by 1,468,235 tons, and sailing ships decreased by 83,079 tons, for a total net increase of 1,533,332 tons. The previous year increased by only 1,119,653 tons. By country, Norway increased the most, followed by England, then France, and then the Netherlands. The United States, on the other hand, decreased compared to the previous year. As for the total tonnage, England still ranks first with a total of 23,100,000 tons, followed by the United States with 23,104,000 tons. Japan has jumped to third place with a total of 4,317,000 tons. However, the total tonnage of England accounted for 54% of the world's total in 1898, fell to 41.6% in 1914, and further fell to 29.9% this year.</p>
<p>[China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Emergency Loan]</p>
<p>Li Guojie Borrowed 55,000 Taels of Silver from the China Business Company</p>
<p>The financial situation of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is deteriorating, and employees are owed wages and coal supplies are often insufficient, resulting in the risk of work stoppages and suspension of navigation. Director Wang Boqun witnessed the difficulties and firmly urged the chairman of the company, Li Weihou, to find a way to raise funds to provide emergency relief. In order to take care of the overall situation, Li has borrowed 55,000 taels of silver from the China Business Company to maintain the status quo. The original text of the instructions of Director Wang on this matter is found and copied below.</p>
<p>Supervision Office of the Ministry of Communications of the National Government, Instructions to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (No. 114) To Li Guojie, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Presenting a Document, Reporting on Complying with the Discussion of Raising Loans, Please Review and Record the Case, It is Known from the Presentation, Check that the current urgent needs of the bureau are waiting for the ship to sail. Since the General Management Office has run out of resources and cannot raise funds, the Chairman is still able to take care of the overall situation and has consulted with General Manager Cai and agreed with the China Business Company to borrow an additional 55,000 taels of silver to relieve the immediate crisis, which is commendable and should be approved for filing. As for the contract and other items, you should still consult with the general manager of the bureau to handle it. This order, September 1, 19th year of the Republic of China, Wang Boqun.</p>
<h3>Existing River and Sea Vessels of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>

If this message cannot be confirmed, people in the financial community have different views. Some said that it had just sold 15 million ounces to Hong Kong, and some expected it to continue to sell due to the decline of business. At the same time as this message was spread in the market, there was another message that the Annam government was selling 5 million old silver coins on the London market. In addition, there is a saying that the ship Egypt, which is currently salvaging gold, in addition to containing gold bars worth 1.6 million pounds of British gold, also contains 1.4 million ounces of silver bars.

This will be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Foreign Shipping Companies Unanimously Oppose Increased Wharfage Rates</h3>

Therefore, the International Chamber of Commerce has submitted a protest to the diplomatic corps, requesting them to appeal to the National Government on their behalf.</p>
<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Requests Prohibition of Re-Taxation by Chongqing Customs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, stating: "On the 2nd of this month, we received a letter from Wing On Textile Co., Ltd., stating that when their machine-made Jin Cheng, Jin Qian, Jia He, Da Zhong Hua, Bao Ding, and Hong Yu brand cotton yarn, cotton thread, and cloth are sold domestically, after paying the regular and additional taxes at the Jianghai Customs, other customs bureaus generally waive re-taxation. This was previously approved by the Ministry of Finance and communicated to all departments and customs bureaus. Recently, goods transported to Chongqing, Sichuan, are still being re-taxed. The company resubmitted this matter to the Ministry of Finance on July 2nd, with approval document No. 10703. We request that you telegraph General Liu in Sichuan and the Department of Finance to quickly investigate and order a halt to the re-taxation and ensure compliance with the regulations. We request your prompt notification."</p>
<p>"Currently, cotton yarn from various Chinese yarn factories being transported to Sichuan, such as Hong Kui Xing, Flying Boat, Race Horse, Golden Rooster, Sailboat, Cai Kui Xing, Cannon Tower, Three Sheep, Hong Fu, Ren Zhong, Red Lion Ball, Single Globe, etc., are exempt from re-taxation by local collection agencies. Only our company's goods have not been granted an exemption. We earnestly request you to telegraph the Chongqing General Chamber of Commerce, requesting them to ask the Chongqing Tax Bureau to handle our company's above-mentioned yarn and cloth transported to Sichuan in accordance with the regulations, exempting them from taxation and facilitating the national goods and helping merchants in difficulty."</p>
<p>"The Chamber of Commerce has investigated that the Jin Cheng, Jin Qian, Jia He, Da Zhong Hua, Bao Ding, and Hong Yu brand cotton yarn and cloth produced by the company were previously approved by your ministry for exemption from re-taxation. Furthermore, the Chongqing Tax Bureau failed to act in accordance with the regulations. The company also obtained approval from your ministry to telegraph General Liu and the Sichuan Department of Finance to halt the re-taxation. Now, according to the letter, the company's above-mentioned yarn and cloth transported to Sichuan have still not been granted an exemption. This violates national laws and obstructs the sales of national goods. We should telegraph your ministry for review and swiftly order compliance to maintain the industry, which would be in the public interest."</p>
<h3>Recent Disaster Situation in Henan Province</h3>
<p>The Jisheng Society Unable to Provide Relief</p>
<p>The China Jisheng Society has recently received successive telegrams from Chairman Li Shican of the Kaifeng Disaster Relief Association in Henan, stating that in the counties of Lanfeng, Yuxian, Tangyin, Mianchi, Gongxian, Luoyang, Shangqiu, Ningling, Linru, Chenliu, Kaocheng, Yanshi, and Zhecheng in Henan Province, some cities have been reduced to ruins due to military disasters and banditry; some have faced drought, locusts, and the suffering of children abandoned and on the verge of death; some have suffered from hailstorms, resulting in crop failures; and some have been engulfed in war, with houses reduced to ashes and lives worth less than grass. The suffering is difficult to describe. They hope that the authorities will take responsibility for rescue, and charitable organizations will show compassion, making a final effort to save those starving and drowning, with voices hoarse, strength exhausted, and tears dried up. They look to the heavens, awaiting relief for the parched land.</p>
<p>The association receives urgent disaster telegrams every day, coming like snowflakes, but they are unable to help. Furthermore, with soldiers and bandits everywhere and iron horses galloping across the land, they are unable to provide relief. After repeated consideration, they can only first send tens of thousands of bottles of disaster relief medicine, to be transferred by Mr. Yu Guisheng, director of the Tianjin Relief Office, to the Henan Disaster Relief Association in the disaster area for preliminary relief. Where can they find patriots to relieve the current suffering of the dying disaster victims?</p>

<h3>Suspicious Sudden Death of Daughter-in-Law of Constable Li Qingfu</h3>
<p>Police Receive Anonymous Letter</p>
<p>Dispatch Detectives for Secret Investigation</p>
<p>Believe Entire Family is Suspect</p>
<p>Interrogation at the Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Li Qingfu, from Anhui, is of a mature age, and has served as a constable in the Public Works Department for thirteen years. He is currently stationed at the Gordon Road Police Station, so his family also lives at 666 Gordon Road. Li's wife, Chen, is forty-seven years old. Their eldest son, Yulong, is twenty-five years old, and their second son, Yukun (also known as Yufang), is twenty-one years old. Both work for the Public Omnibus Company, one as a ticket seller on bus number 220 and the other as a driver on bus number 22. Yulong married a woman surnamed Zhang from Anhui in March of the previous year. Zhang is one year older than Yulong. Not only are the couple's feelings harmonious, but they also get along very well with her parents-in-law, and the family is happy.</p>
<p>Sudden Death from Acute Sha (Heat Stroke) Unexpectedly, on the night of the 27th of last month, Zhang suddenly suffered from acute sha (heat stroke). Despite medical treatment, she died at 4 AM the next morning. Li Qingfu and Yulong purchased a coffin from Zhang Wansheng Coffin Shop on Datong Road in Zhabei. The body was placed in the coffin that afternoon and temporarily stored at the Yangzhou Guild Hall in Zhabei. The matter seemed to be settled.</p>
<p>Neighbors Become Suspicious Because of Zhang's sudden death, neighbors were unclear about the cause of her death and began to speculate. There was much discussion, with some saying she had been murdered by her family. Inspired by these rumors, someone wrote an anonymous letter and sent it to the Gordon Road Police Station and the Special District Court.</p>
<p>Entire Family Arrested Because of the rumors, the police chief believed that there must be some reason for the rumors. He dispatched detective Shao Jingfan for a secret investigation. Shao's investigation concluded that the entire Li family was indeed suspicious, so he arrested Li Qingfu, his wife, and their two sons.</p>
<p>Police's Argument Yesterday, they were brought to the Special District Court, where Judge Wu Tingqi opened the second courtroom for the trial. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the police had received an anonymous letter stating that Li Zhang had been murdered by her family. After investigation, they arrested the family. According to Li Qingfu's statement to the police, his daughter-in-law fell ill at 8:30 PM on the 27th and died at 4 AM the next morning. However, a female neighbor of Li claimed that she saw Li Zhang alive and well at 11 PM on the 27th. This is quite suspicious. He requested that the Zhabei government be contacted to move the coffin to the Forensic Examination Center on Ferren Road for examination. Li Qingfu and others are not currently being charged with any crime, but he requested permission to continue their detention until the body is examined, and then a decision will be made.</p>
<p>Bloodstains and Rope Marks According to the testimony of a worker from Zhang Wansheng Coffin Shop, on the morning of the 28th of last month, Li Qingfu came to the shop to buy a coffin and hired him to help with the placement of the body. He went with Wu Genfa and others and saw that the body was a female, and her inner clothing was already on. They only put on the outer clothing. However, at that time, blood was flowing from the deceased's mouth, and her arms showed reddish-blue marks, and her neck seemed to have rope marks.</p>
<p>Stern Scolding and Non-Stop Cursing According to Bao Wu, a female resident of 665 Gordon Road, next door to Li's house, around 5 or 6 PM on the 27th of last month, she was having dinner in the lane in front of the door. She saw the entire Li family having dinner together at the door. At that time, the deceased mixed cold rice with hot rice and was sternly scolded by her mother-in-law, Li Chen, who cursed her non-stop. She tried to mediate, but was ridiculed.</p>
<p>Funeral Procession Takes Small Roads After dinner, she still went to work the night shift at the yarn factory. When she returned home at 11 PM, she saw the deceased washing clothes at the tap in the lane. At that time, she heard people say that Li Chen had beaten the deceased. At 6 AM the next morning, she saw Li Chen carrying a bundle and going out. When asked where she was going, she said she was going to the countryside. Soon after, she learned that Li Zhang had died before dawn, and the funeral procession took place in the afternoon, not following the main road, but taking a small road through the wilderness to Zhabei. All of these circumstances are suspicious.</p>
<p>Defendants Request Bail Li Qingfu stated that he came home from work at 11 PM that evening. His wife told him that his daughter-in-law was suffering from acute sha (heat stroke). He went out to hire someone to perform sha scraping (a traditional Chinese medical treatment) on his daughter-in-law. Unexpectedly, she died at 4 AM the next morning. He reported this to the Gordon Road Police Station. The other Li Chen and her two sons all firmly stated that Zhang died of acute sha (heat stroke) and hired a lawyer to request that Li's father and sons be released on bail because the family had been arrested, leaving several small children unattended.</p>
<p>Returned to Custody Awaiting Further Interrogation The police lawyer opposed bail and stated that Li Yukun had applied for leave from the Public Omnibus Company the day after Zhang's death, and when Li Qingfu reported to the police station, he said that his brother had died, not mentioning that the deceased was his daughter-in-law, so he was clearly lying. Judge Wu then ordered the four defendants, men and women, to be separately detained for further verification.</p>
<p>From the Civil Detention Center:</p>
<h3>Cai Yunhai Escapes</h3>
<p>During the Wind and Rain Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Cai Yunhai Escapes by Breaking a Window</p>
<p>Cai Yunhai, 25 years old from Guangdong, lives at 22 1/2 Tangshan Road. He used to run the Cai Chen Company at the intersection of Beijing Road and Museum Road, specializing in import and export business. He had entered into a contract with Guo Cunzhong, the owner of the Hua Feng Gold Shop on Xingbi Street in the French Concession, to deliver 500 dozen small pocket knives. After receiving the deposit, he failed to deliver the goods as scheduled, which led Guo to sue him in the Special District Court. He was detained by the court before he fulfilled the contract and delivered the goods in full. However, the deadline for the second batch of 400 dozen pocket knives was approaching, and Cai still failed to fulfill the contract. Guo once again filed a lawsuit. The court opened a trial the day before yesterday and ordered Cai Yunhai to post bail. Because he had no one to post bail, he was sent to the Civil Detention Center, where he was detained in a room on the third floor facing North Zhejiang Road. At 3 AM yesterday morning, during a heavy rain, Cai paced alone in the room, thinking of ways to escape. He saw that the bricks and mortar of the window on the wall were mostly eroded, so he secretly began to break down the damaged area, removing one of the iron bars protecting the window, and then escaped through the window. Although there was a slight noise at the time, it was drowned out by the sound of the wind and rain, so the guards in the center did not notice. It was not until dawn that they realized Cai had escaped. They reported it to Director Xie Fuzi, who reported it to the president of the court and notified the police stations to investigate.</p>
<h3>Three More Robbers Apprehended in the Ten Thousand Yuan Robbery Case; Trial Begins</h3>
<p>Investigation Reveals Liang Houbiao as the Robbery Leader</p>
<p>He Guoyan Claims His Wife and Nephew are Not Involved</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Local Bank sent staff to Shanghai to transport a large sum of banknotes. After arriving in Shanghai, they were robbed of 100,000 yuan by armed bandits while riding in rickshaws past the North Henan Road bridge. A few days ago, Detective You A'gen of the Old Gate Police Station solved the case, arresting eight men and women. After investigation by the Special District Court, one female was released due to lack of involvement. The remaining seven were detained separately. The day before yesterday, more gang members were apprehended and awaited trial. All these details have been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, the police sent He Guo, He Xiangquan, and He Guo's wife, Xu Juhua, all from Shaoxing, to the court for trial. President Zhou Hanting opened the first court for the trial. First, the police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the details of the arrest. According to Wang E, who was apprehended a few days ago, He Guo was an accomplice. Thus, Detective You, together with detectives from the Zhabei Police Station, went to 630 Pushan Road in the early morning and arrested He Guo first. At that time, He Xiangquan handed a piece of paper to Xu Juhua, who read it. It contained information about Liang Houbiao's arrest, so the two were also arrested. Chinese and foreign detectives reported the circumstances of the arrest. President Zhou then questioned He Guo, who confessed that he knew Liang Houbiao through Liang's brother. On the 27th of last month, Wang E came to his house and asked him to go to the North Railway Station to pick up a customer the next day. When Wang arrived, they took a rickshaw to the North Railway Station. When they arrived, four people, Zhu, Hu, Su Ma, etc., arrived in a car. The group went to a teahouse in the concession to drink tea. Later, they saw the train entering the station, and Zhu and the other three bought platform tickets and went to the front of the train. He and Wang E waited outside. A moment later, Zhu and others came out of the station and said that the customer had been picked up. The six of them boarded the original car, and Su, the driver, drove south. When they arrived at North Henan Road, they took out four pistols from their bags and gave him one. Because he was not good at using guns, he did not accept it. However, they threatened him, so he had to take the gun. The remaining three guns were divided among Zhu, Ma, and Hu. The three got out of the car. At that time, the victim was riding in a rickshaw. Ma suddenly snatched a bag. Zhu fired a shot. He stood next to the car. After getting the loot, they boarded the car and drove to a place in the French Concession. They let him get out of the car, saying that they would call him later. He went home. That evening, he was called to Liang Houbiao's house. Liang gave him 500 yuan, and another 500 yuan the next day. Liang had borrowed 200 yuan from him. He gave Liang another 200 yuan. He also returned 200 yuan for a past debt. He had 400 yuan left, which he deposited with a neighbor, Mr. Jia. After he was arrested yesterday, the detectives went to Jia's house to search for the loot, but the money had disappeared. The piece of paper was sent by Liang Houbiao's brother, telling him to flee quickly. His wife, Xu Juhua, and his nephew, He Xiangquan, had nothing to do with the case. He Guo also said that Liang Houbiao was the robbery leader and that they were just dividing the loot. Judge Zhou ordered the three defendants, men and women, to be detained separately and rescheduled the trial.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping of a Boy After Failed Attempt to Open a Strongbox</h3>
<p>Resorted to Kidnapping in Anger</p>
<p>The Zhou Sanhe Strongbox Shop at 149 Ayrlie Road is owned by Zhou Hankun from Jiangxi. Around 8:30 PM last night, four robbers speaking with a Shandong accent suddenly broke in. Each was carrying a pistol, with two wearing black silk short shirts, two wearing white shirts, and the remaining robbers wearing blue short shirts. After entering, three robbers broke into the inner room, and one stood guard outside the door. The robbers who entered the inner room ordered the shop assistant Jiang Hansheng to open the strongbox. However, the shop owner Zhou Hankun had not yet returned at this time, and the box could not be opened. The robbers tried every method but were unable to open it for about three-quarters of an hour. The robbers became impatient and abandoned the box. They grabbed the shop owner's six-year-old son, Fusheng, who was lying on the bed, and ran out of the door. Afterwards, the victim reported the incident to the Tilanqiao Police Station, requesting an investigation. The shop owner, Zhou Hankun, has been running the strongbox shop in Shanghai for more than ten years. It was originally located on Baoshan Road and then moved to Sikaizi Bridge for about two years. It moved to Ayrlie Road last year.</p>
<h3>Ferry Operators Petition for Municipal Ferry to be Converted to Commercial Ferry</h3>
<p>The Lan Ni Ferry in Pudong, one of the eight major ferries on the Huangpu River, has been providing ferry service to the Jiangtian Pier of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on the opposite bank day and night for a long time. It originally started as a charitable ferry. Later, with the approval of the authorities, a fare of 3 cash per person was charged, later increased by 2 cash to 5 cash. Since the change of dynasties, the standard of living has gradually increased, and the fare has been increased repeatedly, from 1 copper coin to 2, 3, and then 4 copper coins. In recent years, the night business has been taken over by double-oared boats, each carrying seven passengers, with the fare increasing from 5 copper coins per person to 6, 7, and even 8 copper coins. However, ferry boats and rowboats, when the wind is calm and the waves are gentle, are relatively safe for passengers. In case of wind and rain, not only is the voyage extremely dangerous, but passengers also find it difficult to embark and disembark on both banks. Ferry operators such as Lu Shanshan, in order to ensure the safety of passengers, jointly petitioned the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities to convert to a steam ferry, but the application was not approved. Recently, the bureau tendered bids for steam ferries and planned to operate them as municipal ferries. The ferry operators, with their livelihoods at stake, unanimously decided to jointly petition the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Public Utilities to convert the proposed municipal steam ferry back to a commercial ferry. The petition was submitted yesterday and is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Government, a petition for appeal. The people have long been engaged in the ferry business at the Lan Ni Ferry in Pudong. Recently, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has taken back the ferry for municipal operation, causing public anxiety. They jointly petitioned to continue to operate the ferry as a commercial ferry and convert it to a steam ferry to ensure the safety of passengers, but the application was not approved. The Lan Ni Ferry in Pudong is one of the eight major ferries. Since the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, it has been a charitable ferry. At the end of each year, it has been given rewards by the authorities to show their concern. Later, as the standard of living increased, the authorities approved the collection of fares to subsidize operations. The Municipal Bureau of Finance also collected donations and issued licenses to protect operations. Afterwards, the ferry business flourished. The people had petitioned the Bureau of Public Utilities to convert to a steam ferry in order to adapt to the trend. Under the governance of the party, the people's livelihood is the top priority. The people are 37 ferry owners at the Lan Ni Ferry, who have been able to make a living for generations. If the ferry is taken back for municipal operation, the people's livelihood will be completely cut off, and they will inevitably become starving corpses. If there is no way to provide relief, the consequences are unimaginable. They have no choice but to file an appeal, requesting the government to sympathize with the people's difficulties, revoke the instructions of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, and approve commercial operation to provide relief. They sincerely submit this urgent petition for review and compliance, which would be in the public interest. Respectfully submitted.</p>

Afterwards, as the ferry business flourished, the authorities approved the collection of fares to subsidize operations. In addition, licenses were issued to protect operations, all of which are on record. Furthermore, in view of the fact that steam ferries are safer than ferry boats, the people previously petitioned the Bureau to convert to a steam ferry, but the application was not approved. Recently, it was reported that the Bureau will convert the Lan Ni Ferry to a municipal steam ferry and build wharves and floating bridges to ensure the safety of passengers, showing the Bureau's dedication to construction. However, the 37 ferry owners have been able to make a living for generations, and their livelihoods will be completely cut off, causing public anxiety. Therefore, on August 10 of this year, a general meeting was convened, resolving to petition the Bureau to convert the above-mentioned municipal ferry to a commercial steam ferry for the benefit of the people's livelihood. In the midst of vigorous construction, this would embody the purpose of benefiting and nurturing the people. Please indicate whether this is feasible for implementation. Respectfully submitted.</p>
<h3>Sixth District Party Headquarters Appeals for the Tragic Death of Lu Lianqiao</h3>

The 47th regular meeting of the association resolved to forward the report to the City Headquarters and issued a declaration appealing for the deceased. The gist of the declaration is that, in order to protect human rights and maintain humanity, the minimum goal is to achieve (punishment of the perpetrators) and (compensation).</p>
<h3>Detective Team Uncovers Illegal Gun Trafficking Case</h3>
<p>Involving Wang Kaitian, a Member of the Self-Defense Corps</p>
<p>Qi Haitian, the leader of the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, recently received a tip from a Shaoxing informant, Shen A'kui, who stated that Zhou Xueshan and Xia Jiugen, who live in a straw shed in Caojiadu, are restless and involved in illegal gun trafficking. He requested that officers be dispatched to arrest them as soon as possible. After receiving the report, Qi Haitian immediately reported to the team leader, Lu Ying, and, under orders, led detectives Wu Kezhong, Wang Yueling, Yang Fuchen, etc., along with the informant, to report to the Sixth District Office and requested dispatch of the office's detectives. They went to the ferry near the Baocheng Yarn Factory to wait. At 2:30 PM, Zhou and Xia arrived, and they were arrested. When questioned about where they were hiding the guns, they confessed that they were hidden in a straw shed on Zhongxing Road. Then, they went to the Fourth District Office and, together with the police chief, went to straw shed No. 10 near the Yangzhou Guild Hall on Zhongxing Road and seized a revolver and 17 bullets. They also found a membership card of Wang Kaitian, a member of the second team of the Pengpu District Self-Defense Corps. Wang was not present at the time. His wife was taken to the corps for questioning. The corps leader stated that Wang was indeed a volunteer member of the corps but did not often come to the team. Wang had prepared the gun himself but had reported that the gun was damaged. At that time, a new one was not issued. Now that someone had reported that Wang was illegally possessing a gun and Wang was not at home, he guaranteed that Wang would be immediately arrested and detained by the detective team to clarify the truth. As for Wang's wife, because she was a woman, he requested that she not be taken into custody. At that time, Qi Haitian, with the corps' verification, released Wang's wife. However, regarding the gun seized in the case, the corps leader claimed that Wang had prepared it himself. Fearing that there were other circumstances, he took Shen, Zhou, and Xia, along with the seized guns, bullets, and membership card, back to the team to report to Team Leader Lu for review and asked him to order corps member Wang Kaitian to be brought to the station for questioning to clarify the truth. However, while the investigation was underway, the leader of the second team of the corps sent squad leader Li Guangfu, along with Wang Kaitian, to the station to await questioning. At that time, Team Leader Lu believed that the circumstances of whether Zhou and Xia, who had been arrested in the case, had conspired to frame someone were not yet clear and could not be judged. Since Wang had the corps' verification that he was a volunteer member, it did not seem appropriate to detain him rashly. He instructed the squad leader to bring Wang to the station for questioning the next day for further review. He questioned Zhou and Xia in detail. Zhou confessed that he was 28 years old, from Wujin, and lived at No. 40 Lao Baidu Ham North, Caojiadu. He worked as a mahogany worker. Xia confessed</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>that he was 21 years old, from Anhui, and lived at No. 21 Guangfu Road, Caojiadu. Both confessed that a month ago, Shen A'kui from Shaoxing had asked them to buy a gun on his behalf. They asked someone surnamed Song, who then asked a stranger. Song said that he had a revolver with only a dozen bullets for sale for 32 yuan. Shen then arranged a time with them to meet at the ferry of the Baocheng Yarn Factory, and as a result, they were arrested and asked for investigation. After receiving the confession, Team Leader Lu believed that the case involved the illegal trafficking of arms, which violated criminal law, and immediately prepared a document to submit it to the Judicial Section for review.</p>

<p>One Female Worker Also in Critical Condition</p>
<p>At the Shuanglun Toothbrush Factory on Xin Ma Road (i.e., Jiangyin Street) in Xiaoximen, a large number of alcohol tanks were stored. The afternoon before yesterday, a male worker surnamed Liu and two female workers, Liu and Gu, were working near the alcohol tanks when, somehow, the alcohol spilled. Flames erupted and smoke billowed. Neighbors, thinking it was a fire, immediately called the West District Fire Brigade. Fire engines and ambulances arrived at the scene and extinguished the fire. Later, they found two female workers and one male worker, all burned to a crisp. The Fire Brigade ambulance immediately took the workers to Shanghai Hospital.

<h3>Son-in-Law Demands Wife from Father-in-Law</h3>
<p>Xiao Maozi's Whereabouts Unknown</p>
<p>Tan Honglin, a Jiangbei native residing at No. 1, Lane 2, Nanlin Li, Zhabei, who currently drives a rickshaw for a foreigner, is 45 years old. The day before yesterday, he brought his son-in-law, Wu Wendian (28 years old), to a police station in the Fourth District, accusing him, "My daughter, Xiao Maozi, is now married to Wu. Since their marriage, Wu has repeatedly abused her. My daughter works in a silk factory, and Wu takes her wages to gamble. On August 13th, she received her wages, and my daughter's whereabouts became unknown. Now, Wu is demanding her from me and has ruined my business. Today, he asked me to a 'tea meeting'. When we reached Xinjiang Road, three people suddenly dragged me aside and, without explanation, cut me in the head several times with a knife. Please investigate." When questioned, Wu Wendian stated, "Xiao Maozi and I have been engaged for many years. I asked to marry her several times, but she refused. This year, we set the auspicious date of the nineteenth day of the first month. I hired a sedan to bring her from my father-in-law's house, but my father-in-law smashed the sedan. After repeated persuasion, he finally agreed to let me marry her on the twenty-third day of the first month. Not long after, my father-in-law taught his daughter to divorce me, but it was unsuccessful. Today, Xiao Maozi suddenly ran away. It must be my father-in-law's instigation. In the past, we had arguments, and we went to a police station in the Fourth District to appeal to the Municipal Police Bureau and even litigated in the District Court. The injury on my father-in-law's head was not inflicted by me," etc. Because the matter concerns harming a relative, he was instructed to appeal to the Municipal Police Bureau for investigation and verification.</p>
<h3>Enticing Women and Forcing Them into Prostitution</h3>
<p>Zhang Xia Shi Detained for a Year and a Half</p>
<p>Procuress Zhang Xia Shi abducted a sixteen-year-old girl, Zhang Xiaomei, and brought her to Shanghai this spring. Recently, she rented a house in the French Concession and forced Zhang Xiaomei to go out and solicit customers. The case was discovered by a French Concession detective, who brought Xia Shi and Xiaomei to the police station. Yesterday, they were brought to the French Court for investigation. The Western detective reported the situation. When questioned, Zhang Xiaomei stated, "My parents are both dead. In the spring of this year, Xia Shi abducted me to her home and lived with her until the second day of this month, when she ordered me to go out and solicit customers. When I refused, I was beaten. Now, I have been arrested, and I request release." Xia Shi stated, "I have always done small business. Last year, I met Xiaomei on the street and became acquainted with her. Because she was destitute, I took her in. She voluntarily became a prostitute, and I did not force her." Her remaining statements were evasive. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Zhang Xia Shi to detention in a women's prison for one and a half years. Zhang Xiaomei was sent to the Jiliang Institute for arranged marriage.</p>
<h3>Shameless Man and Woman Arrested Together</h3>
<p>Zhang Pan Shi, the 49-year-old wife of Zhang Pu Long, residing at No. 9, Gan in Laobaidu, Pudong, was promiscuous. She was having an affair with Zhang Shi Quan. Because Zhang Pu Long was not home during the day and only returned late at night, she took advantage of this time for secret rendezvous and enjoyment. The night before last, Zhang Pu Long returned home around 10:00 PM. After opening the door, he did not expect Zhang Shi Quan to be hiding behind the door. As soon as Zhang Pu Long saw him, he asked what he was doing. Unexpectedly, Zhang Shi Quan grabbed Zhang Pu Long's throat, and Zhang Pan Shi began to beat him. However, Zhang Pu Long was strong and powerful. He grabbed Zhang Shi Quan and Zhang Pan Shi's wrists and shouted loudly. The patrol police arrived and brought them to the First Sub-bureau of the Third District. Yesterday, they were sent to the District Court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fresh Fish Boat Robbed</h3>
<p>The Ningbo fresh fish boat of Fei Jinmao recently loaded ice crabs and yellow croaker in Ningbo to be transported to Shanghai for sale. The afternoon before yesterday, when sailing in the sea area of Chuansha, about seventy to eighty miles outside the Wusong estuary, they suddenly encountered a red-headed pirate ship sailing towards them. When Fei's ship saw the red-headed ship sailing straight towards them, the crew was terrified, fearing a collision. They shouted to the other ship and tried to steer away. Unexpectedly, pirates swarmed out of the cabin of the other ship, stood on the deck, and, carrying long guns or broadswords, forced them to lower the sail and stop. The owner of Fei's ship, realizing they were pirates, instructed the crew to resist with all their might and pull up the sails to escape. The pirates saw this and opened fire, killing one crew member and wounding three. At this point, the crew panicked and ran into the cabin. The pirates swarmed aboard, attacking people indiscriminately, wounding another three or four crew members, and dragging the ship owner from his bed, demanding silver dollars. The ship owner said, "My fish boat has no large amount of silver dollars." After saying this, he went under the bed and handed over more than one hundred yuan to the pirates. The pirates did not believe him, saying, "Such a large boat only has this amount?" They beat the ship owner again. He begged on the ground, "If you find silver, do as you please." They searched all the crew but found nothing. At that moment, they heard the sound of a whistle approaching. The pirates stopped robbing. Before leaving, they kidnapped two crew members. After being taken to the pirate ship, the two crew members begged, and they were released. The two pirate ships fled towards the East Sea. Currently, Fei's ship is docked in Chongming. Yesterday, the ship owner prepared coffins for the two crew members who were killed and sent the injured to the hospital. He also reported the incident to the water police for investigation.</p>
<h3>Confirmation of Sun Yizhi's Suicide</h3>
<p>Detailed Information from Guangren Bureau</p>
<p>Family to Go to Ningbo to Claim Coffin</p>
<p>Sun Yizhi (erroneously written as "Yiding" yesterday), of No. 31, Chunde Li, Lanweiai Road, French Concession, a native of Nanjing, also known as Dinghong, left home on August 26th and went to Ningbo. On August 30th, he sent a letter from Ningbo to his sister, Sun Erbao, stating that he was committing suicide by drowning due to unemployment. The whereabouts of his body were unknown, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now confirmed that Sun Dinghong committed suicide by drowning in Ningbo. Around 12:00 PM yesterday, his sister, Sun Erbao, received a letter from the Guangren Bureau in Meixu, Ningbo, stating, "Our bureau today (the 1st) collected the body of a man from the water. He was about twenty years old, with Western-style hair. He was wearing a undershirt, an Indian silk small shirt, an Indian silk long shirt, a leather belt, Indian silk pants with half a pair of lining pants, silk socks, and elephant hide shoes. After an examination by the Yinxian County police, the coffin is temporarily kept in our bureau. The next day, a straw hat and an envelope were found on the Muddy Beach across the river. The envelope was addressed to the Sun Residence, No. 30, Tangjiawan, Chunde Li, French Concession. There was no paper inside the envelope. Has your family lost a man? Please reply immediately." The remains were collected on the spot by the local security officer Chen Hepai. After receiving the devastating news, Sun Erbao and his wife, Rong, were in inconsolable grief, a truly pitiful sight. After persuasion from relatives and neighbors, they were told to take care of the aftermath. Therefore, they asked relatives Hua Yongxing and Wang Jusheng, and his wife, Rong, to go to Shanghai-Ningbo today to identify the body and bury it.</p>
<h3>Car Runs Over Boy</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 6:50 AM, near the intersection of Dongbai Broadway and Maohai Road in the International Settlement, two Westerners were driving a rental car with license plate number 10276 from west to east at high speed. A six- or seven-year-old boy was standing by the roadside, looking around. When he saw the car approaching, he was terrified. The Westerners also panicked and could not avoid him due to their excessive speed, causing the car to knock the boy down. The wheels ran over his head, chest, and other parts, causing blood to gush out. He was barely breathing. The boy's family heard the noise, came out, and, together with Indian police, detained them at the Huishan Police Station and sent the boy to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Zhang Lin Shi Dies Immediately After Getting Off Train</h3>
<p>At the Shanghai South Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, yesterday at 12:40 PM, the early express train from Hangzhou arrived at the station. In the third-class carriage of the train was a female passenger, Zhang Lin Shi, 47 years old, from Dajing, Taizhou. She was suffering from ascites. She had purchased a ticket from Jiaxing to transfer to Taizhou to return to her hometown. She was accompanied by her daughter, Chen Zhang Shi, and son-in-law, Chen Rongfa, who were also going to Taizhou. After the female passenger Zhang Lin Shi got off the train and was about to hire a rickshaw to go to the 16th Pier to transfer to a ship to Taizhou, she suddenly fell ill and died on the grassy area south of the station before leaving the railway boundary. The station police, Lei Tai, went to take care of the situation and reported it to the South Station Police Department, which in turn reported it to the District Court for investigation. Later, her son-in-law, Chen Rongfa, and daughter, Chen Zhang Shi, went to the court to request an exemption from the investigation and prepared a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Naked Male Corpse</h3>
<p>A male corpse was found on Huaizhen Road, Jiumu Di, yesterday. He was about forty years old and had a beard. What was strange was that he was completely naked. It is unknown how he died in this manner. Some informed sources said that this person had been ill for a long time and had also been in business before, but he had become destitute. Perhaps he had pawned everything until he had no clothes left. The Second District First Sub-bureau learned of the matter and ordered Jiang Pingyang, the head of the Ninth Block, to report to the District Court. Prosecutor Yang and others arrived at the scene to investigate and determined that he had died of illness. The body was ordered to be collected by the mortuary.</p>
<h3>Changing "Wood" to "Iron" on Injury Report</h3>
<p>Judge Feng Reopens Debate</p>
<p>Li Zhu Shi, the owner of Demao Cigarette and Paper Store at the corner of North Sichuan Road and Peng Road, previously accused her uncle, Li Songtao, in the Special District Court of committing assault and causing bodily harm. Judge Feng Shide held a hearing and ordered a forensic examination to determine the extent of the injuries before issuing a verdict. On the 25th of last month, the debate was reopened. The lawyer representing the defendant, Li Songtao, first stated that the defendant was concerned that the plaintiff was faking injuries. Therefore, they paid close attention to the plaintiff's actions. On the evening of the 16th of last month, they heard the plaintiff's son, A Pei, whispering with his friend, Zhu Xingyi, about "sixty yuan for going abroad" and "iron weapon injuries." Later, they reviewed the injury report and found that it listed "iron weapon injuries." When the plaintiff was at the police station, they only claimed to have been hit on the head. Now, the injury report lists injuries not only on the head, arms, and legs, but also on the chest, back, and thighs. Therefore, the plaintiff's injuries are inconsistent. Unless the forensic examination was imprecise, the plaintiff must have been faking injuries afterward. After Judge Feng questioned and concluded the debate, he scheduled the verdict for the 25th of last month. However, the verdict was not announced by the due date. Judge Feng discovered that the "iron" character in "iron weapon injuries" on the injury report had originally been a "wood" character that had been altered. Considering that there was a major suspicion, he summoned the plaintiff and defendant and the forensic doctor to reopen the debate a few days ago. Judge Feng showed the injury report to the forensic doctor and asked who had altered the "iron" character. The forensic doctor testified that the original injury report listed "wood weapon injuries," and he did not know who had altered the character. The case has been investigated and is awaiting the verdict.</p>
<h3>Cook Commits Suicide by Ingesting Smoke</h3>
<p>Gao Jinlai, a native of Yancheng, 24 years old, was a cook at Siming Hospital. The day before yesterday, he had an argument with his sister at home over a trivial matter. He suddenly had a momentary impulse and committed suicide by ingesting raw smoke. When the poison took effect, his family discovered it and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. Due to the severe poisoning, treatment was ineffective, and he died around 2:00 PM that afternoon. The hospital notified the French police, who took the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for examination. Yesterday, the deceased's father, Gao Hualiang, went to the police station to request an exemption from the examination. The police chief approved it. He then prepared clothes and a coffin for burial and transported the body back to his hometown for burial.</p>
<h3>Small Note on the Collapse of Wall in Zhizhong Li</h3>
<p>The land on the west side of Xixinqiao Street, Xizilaihuo Street, French Concession, belongs to Tongren Fuyuan Hall. City buildings and residential neighborhoods are currently under construction. The project is named Zhizhong Li. Construction has been accelerated in recent days, with delivery scheduled for the end of September. Due to continuous rain, about a dozen feet of brick wall suddenly collapsed at 10:00 AM yesterday. The sound was loud. Fortunately, the rain had stopped work, and no craftsmen were injured. It was a close call.</p>
<h3>Wang Yuan and Others Distribute Flyers, Fined</h3>
<p>After 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, many bookstore employees went to Fuzhou Road to inform the workers of various bookstores about the strike. The General Police Department's Political Department received a phone report from the Modern Bookstore at the location. They immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives Pan Lianbi and Pu Pu, and detective Li Haifeng, to stop them. When they arrived at the Modern Bookstore, the workers had already left the Modern Bookstore and gone to the Sishudian Joint Sales Department to carry out the same actions. By the time they arrived at the sales department, the group had left for other bookstores. They kept missing each other. Later, they encountered each other outside the Taidong Bookstore. They saw about a hundred workers doing the work of posting slogans and distributing flyers and trying to force the Taidong store workers to strike. The Chinese and Western detectives arrested four leaders, Wang Yuan from Wuxi, Cai Wuguan, Chen Yun from Hubei, and Wang Rong. The rest dispersed. The content of the distributed flyers was to demand higher wages, implement an eight-hour workday, and other preferential treatment. Yesterday, the police charged them in the Special District Court for violating Article 318 of the Criminal Law. During the trial, the police lawyer Li Zhishan added another charge in court, stating that the four defendants had used words and pictures to induce people to violate the law, violating Article 160 of the Criminal Law. After Presiding Judge Zhou questioned Wang and others individually, he sentenced each of them to a fine of thirty yuan. If they could not afford to pay, they were allowed to commute each two yuan to one day of imprisonment. The flyers were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Private Gambling Clubs, Each Fined 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>Wang Zimiao, No. 1, Fukang Li, Lafayette Road, and Xu Chunfu, No. 9, Dexiang Li, Lanweiai Road, privately set up gambling clubs and listening tubes to lure people to gamble, violating the prohibition. The French police detective learned of this and raided the locations the day before yesterday, confiscating gambling evidence, silver dollars, and other items. They were taken to the police station. Yesterday, they were brought to the French Court for investigation. The two defendants confessed that they had privately set up listening tubes to lure people to gamble. The judge sentenced each of the two defendants to a fine of one hundred yuan, to be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Railway Department Promotes the Purchase and Use of Domestic Coal</h3>
<p>Coal Production and Sales Association Sends Letter of Introduction</p>
<p>The China National Coal Production and Sales Association sent a letter to the Purchasing Committee of the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing yesterday, stating, "We have recently read in the newspaper that your committee is now under the Ministry's order to order 4,000 tons of domestic bituminous coal for the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. It is evident that your committee has the enthusiasm to promote domestic goods by using domestic coal for national railways. China's coal mines produce the most and largest amounts of bituminous coal. Since the military uprising, transportation has been obstructed, preventing domestic coal from reaching its destination. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Railways, vehicles can be allocated by the Ministry as long as there is coal. The bituminous coal produced by the Boshan Coal Mine in Shandong is very suitable for the railway bureau. Our association is willing to introduce the coal produced by the mine to meet the needs of your committee. However, the Jiaoji Railway has only been open for a short time, and there is a shortage of vehicles. May your committee request the Ministry of Railways to order the Jiaoji Railway Bureau to allocate vehicles for the transport of this coal? Please reply to us."</p>
<h3>Resignation of Chinese Director of Taxpayers' Association, Bei Songsun</h3>
<p>Re-election at Chamber of Commerce on the 5th of This Month</p>
<p>Bei Songsun, the Chinese director of the Taxpayers' Association in the concession, has resigned from his concurrent position because he was assigned to go abroad to study banking by the Bank of China. The meeting has resolved to approve the resignation. The association has set the afternoon of the 5th of this month at 2:00 PM at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Standing Committee Room to resolve the re-election of the Chinese director. Yesterday, they specifically sent a letter to the External Affairs Office in Shanghai, requesting that a representative be sent to attend and supervise the election. It is reported that Director Chen Shiguang has designated Deputy Director Liu Yunfang to attend as a representative.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Increasing Fees for Purchasing Passenger Clearance and Cargo Discharge Permits</h3>
<p>Reply from the Inspector General of Customs to the Shipping Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association previously received letters from member companies stating that the Customs had received an order from the Inspector General of Customs to uniformly increase the fees for purchasing passenger clearance and cargo discharge permits by 80% after 6:00 PM and on Sundays and holidays from the 16th of this month. After receiving the letter, the Shipping Association sent a letter to the Inspector General of Customs Public Office, requesting the revocation of the order. Yesterday, the Inspector General of Customs Public Office replied to the Shipping Association, "In reply, we have received your association's letter No. 70, stating that member companies have received a customs notice saying that it has received an order from the Inspector General of Customs, instructing to uniformly increase the fee by eighty percent for purchasing passenger clearance and cargo discharge permits for all ships after six o'clock and on Sundays and holidays starting from September sixteenth. We are really not able to shoulder the expense and plead for you to represent us in sincerely asking that the order be withdrawn in order for us to eke out a living. We have investigated what you have stated and what you said is indeed the case and we urgently report the situation for your perusal so that the previous order for increasing the fees is rescinded in order to aid our difficulties and maintain the shipping business etcetera. Having given these matters our consideration, we are explaining to your association the reasons for our decision to increase the permit fees so that all shipowners will understand that our office increasing the fees is really not something we did willingly. The amount of special permit fees that we currently collect is the same as it was sixty years ago. Back then, the fee was sufficient to cover the Customs’ expenses for all the overtime work done during evenings, Sundays, and public holidays, so the regulations were considered reasonable then, but now sixty years have passed. In these sixty years, prices have soared, and they continue to rise. Taking the average price of a year ago, prices have increased by two or three times compared with the tenth year of the Tongzhi reign, so the Customs’ expenses have increased similarly, but the special permit fees have not been increased once. The drop in the price of silver last year caused prices to rise further to a point where they were double those of last year, and the current price is about six times higher than it was sixty years ago. In this situation, where fees for the transshipment of goods, ship water fees, and delay fees have increased, it is difficult for the Customs to continue to use the previous regulations for these permits without increasing them appropriately. The Customs could reduce the number of staff it needs to reduce expenses if it were to cancel the convenience of ships being able to load and unload goods at night or on holidays, but this would have a large impact on business, so we have given the matter much consideration and determined that the only way to proceed is to increase the permit fees so that the additional fees can contribute to the expense that the additional workload necessitates. The increase has been decided to be eighty percent. If one were to think carefully about how prices have increased over the last sixty years, one could not say that the amount is too high. Furthermore, the amount of delay fees set by the various shipping companies is much higher than it was sixty years ago. In the future, when the permit fee has increased to eighteen taels, if the shipowners pay the fee according to the set amount, the ship will not be delayed, and the expenses saved on delay fees will be greater than the ten taels that would have been saved sixty years ago, so it is only natural that the Customs increase the special permit fee. Moreover, the Customs increasing the special permit fee is different from increasing tariffs or tonnage duties, because an increase in tariffs and tonnage duties means that ship owners and shippers have no choice but to pay the fees while shipowners are free to choose whether to purchase a special permit or not. The Customs is not compelling merchants to purchase the special permit, and if merchants think that the fee is too high and they would rather delay the shipping of goods than purchase the special permit, the Customs is happy to allow them to do so and will not interfere in their decision. In short, our office is always concerned about the difficult situation facing merchants and will do everything in our power to alleviate the difficulties. However, this increase in the special permit fee is due to the aforementioned unavoidable circumstances. It is hoped that domestic war will end and business will return to normal by next month (September) the increase in the permit fee takes effect on September the sixteenth. We are responding to the letter that you have sent and hope that you will investigate this matter. After receiving the letter, the association copied the original letter and sent it to its member companies for reference.</p>
<h3>Director Wu of the Construction Bureau Discusses the Situation of the Minping Road</h3>
<p>The National Road Association plans to build a highway from Minhang in Shanghai to Pinghu in Zhejiang Province as a commemorative road for the association's tenth anniversary. The Shanghai County Government has already issued instructions to the Construction Bureau to prepare a plan. Director Wu has sent people to investigate and solicit opinions from Jinshan, Fengxian, and Pinghu counties and reported the situation to the county government, which has replied to the association. Director Wu gave a detailed account of the surveyed route yesterday, stating that there are approximately two routes in general: (1) Ferrying from Minhang south to Punan, passing through Nanqiao and Zhalin, then turning west along the sea dike to Pinghu. This route is about four li from the ferry to Punan and then south to Xiaotang in the territory of Taiping Township, Nanhui County. It is said that construction is scheduled to begin after autumn this year. It is twelve li from Xiaotang south to Nanqiao. The roadbed has been completed by the Fengxian County Construction Bureau in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, and the plans for bridges and culverts have also been drafted and are scheduled to be constructed within the year. However, it is unlikely that the approximately seventeen li section from Nanqiao to Zhalin will be built in the short term. From Zhalin, turning west, passing through Hequekou, Jinshanzui, Jinshanwei, Xugongting, and other places, is approximately more than fifty li. The original sea dike can be used. From Xugongting, northwest, passing through Zhao Jiaqiao, Zhou Jiaxu Zhen, and other towns in Pinghu, to reach Pinghu, is 46 li. The advantages of this route are: (1) The Minnan Road can be used; (2) the sea dike, bridges, and culverts can be used, and the land price can be saved. It is estimated that only the 17 li from Nanqiao to Zhalin and the 46 li from Xugongting to Pinghu, a total of 60 li, need to be built. However, there are also three disadvantages: (1) The route is 130 li long; (2) the route is a large arc; (3) there are few prosperous towns along the way, and the output of grain, cotton, etc., is less than that of fish and salt, making it difficult to develop business. (2) From Minhang to Nanqiao, turning west, passing through Zhuanghang, Tinglin and Zhangyan, which are under the jurisdiction of Songjiang County, and Qinwangshan and other towns, which are under the jurisdiction of Jinshan County, to reach the east gate of Pinghu. This route is the same as the first route from Minhang to Nanqiao. From Nanqiao, turning west and passing through Zhuanghang to Yandun Zhen is more than 31 li, which is under the jurisdiction of Fengxian County. From Yandun Zhen, crossing the Longquan Port (river width is about 20 meters) into the territory of Songjiang County, six li southwest is Tinglin Zhen. Fourteen li south is Zhangyan Zhen, crossing Zhangjing in the west of the town into the territory of Jinshan County. Sixteen li to the southwest, passing the north of Qinwang Mountain, to Xinmiao Zhen, which is under the jurisdiction of Pinghu County. 11 more li west is Guangchen Zhen, which is the place with the lowest terrain in Pingfeng (there are many lakes and swamps, making construction difficult). 25 more li west is the east gate of Pinghu County. The advantages of this route are: (1) The Minnan Line can be used; (2) the route is more direct, the total length is 110 li, which is 20 li less than the first line; (3) There are many prosperous cities and towns along the way, and there is an abundance of cotton and rice, so business should be more developed. As for the disadvantages, there are more bridges and culverts, and there is nothing to borrow except for the Minnan Line, so everything must be built, and the land price and construction costs are huge. The above two routes have their own advantages and disadvantages. However, the cost plan and other items must first clarify the width of the road surface and the type of road surface, and then make an approximate estimate. If you want an accurate budget, you must also understand the land price in each place, the type of bridge, and carry out a precise survey before you can make a plan for use as a standard. The route passes through Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and those in the Jiangsu boundary must pass through Nanhui, Fengxian, Songjiang, and Jinshan counties. Unless the two provinces are consulted by letter and special commissioners are organized to form a surveying team, it will be difficult to gather things. Although the starting point of the selected route is in Shanghai, the place it passes through is all in dangerous terrain. Therefore, when our bureau sent personnel to investigate, we deeply felt that the authority was not within our scope, and there were many obstacles.</p>

<h3>Reorganizing Charitable Organizations' Property</h3>
<p>Organizing a Reorganization Committee</p>
<p>In order to reorganize the property of charitable organizations in this city and increase their income, a Charity Organization Property Reorganization Committee will be established. It will be composed of one representative from each of the five bureaus (Social Affairs, Land, Finance, Public Works, and Public Security), four representatives designated by the Federation of Charitable Organizations, and two expert committee members. It is learned that the Land Bureau has appointed Xu Zhendong, the Finance Bureau has appointed Zhang Jie, the Public Security Bureau has appointed Xi Yu Shuo, the Public Works Bureau has appointed Mo Heng, and the Social Affairs Bureau has appointed Feng Liutang as members of the Reorganization Committee. Once the Federation of Charitable Organizations designates representatives and the Social Affairs Bureau appoints expert committee members, the committee can be formally established.</p>
<h3>New Product: Gramophone Oil</h3>
<p>Gramophones come in double-spring and single-spring varieties, but after prolonged use, they often develop a rattling sound inside, and the movement becomes sluggish, uneven in speed, and prone to mainspring breakage or gear damage (if excessively thick, gummy oil is used, the parts can become greasy; if too thin and fluid, lubrication is inadequate). The Sheep Brand dual-purpose oil for gramophones and records, newly invented by the Anquan Trading Company of Weian Lane, Hai Ning Road, this city, ensures smooth operation when dripped into the mechanism. Gears and springs are also protected from breakage. Recently, records are being played with electric pickups, resulting in exceptionally loud and clear sound and timbre. However, prolonged playing can cause white lines to appear on the record, or the stylus may drag or become stuck, or even lose the original sound.

<h3>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Adopts Qu's Telegraph Code Method</h3>
<p>Qu Chongfu, a master's degree holder who studied abroad, has extensive experience in cataloging. He has always felt that our country's telegraphic code checking is complicated and difficult, which is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors. He finally succeeded in creating a special method. The basic strokes of his checking method only have ten major parts, unlike the old method where each character must be painstakingly searched for in the two hundred and fourteen letters. Any person can learn this checking method in just five minutes. The newly compiled "Qu's Telegraph Code Checking" book was first approved by Hu Shi, He Lu, and Gu Shusen. Furthermore, at the National Library Association in the capital last year, one hundred and seventy-odd library experts publicly tested the method, and the result was that each character only required five seconds to check. Yuan Tongli, chairman of the association, and Dai Zhichou, the current president, both certified and signed that it eliminates previous complexities and provides convenience to society. Yesterday, the Telegraph Section of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government in Nanjing sent a letter to Mr. Qu, excerpted below: "Mr. Chongfu, greetings. Since you invented the telegraph code checking method, users have praised its convenience. Our ministry has been revising the telegraph book. After much consideration regarding the checking method, we have finally decided to adopt your method. If you agree, please reply so that we can proceed. Furthermore, we plan to inquire at any time if we encounter difficulties. We hope that you will not hesitate to give us your advice. Sincerely, the Telegraph Section of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs." It is said that there are not many copies of the newly published "Qu's Telegraph Code Checking" book left. Those who want to see it first can order it from the Qu's Telegraph Code Checking Company, the general distributor at No. 62 Jiangxi Road, this city.</p>

<h3>European Travel Correspondence (72)</h3>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Touring the Palace of Versailles (7) Versailles</p>
<p>It was truly a bit heavy. A torrential rain and gale swept in. The entire sky was black. Seriously lacking even a sliver of light. The torrential rain soaked through our bodies, the dark clouds pressed down on our souls. This was truly a bit serious, for a very long time. The wind and rain still did not cease, as if they wanted to drag us into hell. I looked at the inky black sky, and I waited for what seemed like a long time. Finally, the wind and rain subsided. The black clouds also retreated a bit. A sliver of light penetrated through the green thicket. At the same time, a gust of cold air and a foul odor from myself also arrived. My skin and pores felt strangely uncomfortable. The birds in the forest also slowly began to chirp. So, we slightly poured out the accumulated water from the boat and continued to sit inside, rowing back. The head of the refined scholar was soaked by the rain, his permed hair hanging straight down his face, only touching his eyelids, brushing up and down. There were also many other tourists who had independently opened their boats and were floating in the middle of the stream. I ended up looking at their crazed faces.</p>
<p>"Although we have experienced hardships, we have also found it to be elegant and full of interest," said Mr. Chen Renhao leisurely.</p>
<p>Yes. The Palace of Versailles under clear skies is certainly not bad. But touring Versailles during a storm is even more of a point of pride for us, or perhaps even a masterpiece. Those who truly understand life, who want to thoroughly explore the depths of human interest, should seek interest in storms, in darkness, even in sin and ugliness. Because within these things there is a deeper poetry, a more profound and stimulating beauty. Ordinary people only find beauty in clear mountains and waters, only find goodness in doing things in a straightforward manner. These people have not truly understood life, nor have they tasted its profound meaning. The purpose of being a person is not to be a purely good and obedient son to one's father. Abundant food and clothing can never satisfy your ideals, but rather the pursuit of human interest in various deeper meanings. Therefore, the German music sage Beethoven liked to create music scores with the sounds of storms and gales, creating stirring, passionate, and tormented expressions. The French poet Baudelaire C. Bendelaie even described the facts of obscene sexual desire nakedly and without reservation, praising sin and evil. The modern great sculptor Rodin A. Rodin liked to praise the ugly. Many of his great works are seen by the common people as ugly and obscene things. We entered the Rodin Museum, and in the center of the middle room was a large work called (The Kiss). This is the pose of a naked man and woman embracing tightly. From all angles, there is not a single part of their flesh that is not trembling. This is also something that expresses sexual desire without reservation. There is also a sculpture displayed upstairs, titled (Ladelle Casquettiere). It is a naked old woman, resting her hands and looking down at her own body. Her skin is like chicken skin, her bones are thin, and she is very ugly. He wants to recognize a kind of decadent pleasure, or the sweetness of poison, in what is commonly considered ugly.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Reaches New Heights</h3>
<p>The price of gold suddenly takes a sharp turn upwards. Yesterday, the price of gold once again showed a sharp upward trend, transactions were active, and the market reached new heights. The upward trend continued, exceeding the 60 tael mark. However, there were fluctuations of two or three taels in both the morning and afternoon markets, with a total fluctuation of more than ten taels throughout the day. As for foreign exchange, it was generally stable, with a strong upward trend among dealers. Buyers were bold and fearless, with Fuchang, Xinyong, Xiangyuanxing, and others making large purchases. Yuanmaoyong and small retail investors were mainly selling. Although the morning market was long, it was still flat. As soon as buyers became active, the price immediately rose. The afternoon market was even stronger, with frequent increases of as much as seven taels. However, from morning to noon, there were ups and downs of three or four taels. Later, Zhifeng, Yongcui, Tai, and others showed unexpected buying interest, while Shunli, Yuanmaoyong, and others slightly sold off. Because the Indian exchange rate contracted, the market situation was even more sharp, and the price soared to 67-68 taels. However, the exchange rate happened to be on Wednesday, when there is usually no market. Afterwards, the price decreased slightly by two taels, settling at 66 taels. People could not help but feel apprehensive about the future.</p>
<p>Speculators rush to cover positions, pushing the price above 60 taels. The opening price for the October contract was 557 taels and 3 mace, a decrease of 9 mace. This was because the price of silver bars had increased by 16/3 of a cent, and the price of silver was the same as before. However, the gross price immediately turned higher, mainly because Fuchang, Yuancheng, Yongxinyong, Xiangyuan, and others were all buying, and the price of large bars was also increasing, so the price rose to 61 taels and 45 mace. After a slight decrease of one or two taels, the initial order was to hold the price steady, and then the price rose to 61 taels and 67 mace, then to 2 taels and 78 mace. Internally, the English Gold Bank mutually transacted September at 7 375/10000 pence, and November at 4375/10000 pence. Later, the price gradually declined by three or four taels, to around 61 taels. At 10:30 am, it broke into the 60 tael mark because Shunli, Wanxing, Taikangrun, and others all sold off, dragging the price down. At 10:45 am, the price was only 58 taels and 8 mace. At this time, the October English gold contract could be settled at 7 4375/10000 pence, and the November contract was sold by Sanbing and others at 7 1/2 pence. Afterwards, buyers in the market suddenly emerged, and Yongchengchang, Zhifengyong, and others rushed to buy. Also, those who had previously shorted the market covered their positions, so after 11:00 am, the price once again rushed above the 60 tael mark, rising at a leisurely pace. The high point was five or six taels, with small fluctuations of one or two taels. At the close of the market, the price jumped to 65 taels. The afternoon closing price was 4 taels and 4 mace.</p>
<p>Afternoon closing price up 7 taels and 6 mace from the previous day. The afternoon market opened at 63 taels and 1 mace, then fell from 64 taels to 63 taels and 23 mace, due to selling by small retail investors. Afterwards, the Indian exchange rate fell by 4 annas, and the atmosphere suddenly became favorable. Rumors spread that India still wanted to sell silver, so dealers ignored the truth and rushed to buy, pushing the price to 67 taels and 8 mace at 3:00 pm. However, because the exchange rate was on Wednesday, there was no market. After that, sellers entered the market, and the price fell back to 5 and a half taels. After 3:30 pm, the price jumped up another tael or so. At 4:00 pm, the price was around 7 taels. It returned to around five taels in a state of panic.

<h3>Brokerage Interest Rate Set, Guangdong Coins Soar</h3>
<p>Market Overview The current silver dollar market situation is consistently sluggish. The drop in the price of silver dollars due to the opening of the coin factory is what should have happened, given the facts. The silver discount has always been loose and excessive, with no intrinsic value. As for bank collections and settlements, they were generally normal. However, because the Dalian banks were taking away large quantities of Guangdong coins, the price soared. There are no other noteworthy news items.</p>
<p>Brokerage and Discount Rates (Silver Dollars) The morning market was 7 mace 2 fen 8 li 7 hao and a half, slightly better than the previous day by 1 hao 2 hu and a half.

<h3>Interest Rate Set at Two Taels</h3>
<p>The issue of interest rates for August was due to the extremely low silver discount, which was less than one tael for the entire month, so the interest rate could not be increased. Details were recorded in this newspaper's previous discussion at the Association's regular meeting. The Association decided that the interest rate for this time would still be the fixed minimum price of 2.95 taels as the standard, and the back interest would be added according to the sitting price of 4.5 taels. Therefore, the highest back interest rate would still be only 10.053 taels.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Continue to Rise Strongly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for various public bonds traded only 5,000 yuan, and the futures market traded more than 10 million yuan. Besides the demobilization and troop reduction bonds, which accounted for about 3.67 million, and the customs duties, which accounted for 1.8 million, the rest was very sparse. As for the trend of various bond prices, the optimistic situation and the improved morale led to an upward trend as soon as the market opened in the morning. Afterwards, buyers continued to dominate, and the prices rose steadily. Among them, the 19th year cigarette bonds had the strongest upward trend, with the near-term bonds rising by 2.75 yuan compared to the previous day, the October bonds rising by 2.2 yuan, the troop reduction bonds rising by about 1.5 yuan, and the demobilization and customs duties bonds rising by about 1 yuan.

<h3>The Yarn and Cotton Markets Remain Weak</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still weak, and the trend is even weaker. This is because the overseas yarn and cotton markets are consistently trending downwards. The recent unfavorable environment has led to a decline in morale. The most powerful bulls have successively sold to close their positions, so the market atmosphere is relatively loose. However, the attitude of the manufacturers is still normal. Japanese merchants are buying in large quantities. The volume of transactions for the Sichuan banks is still good, while the transactions for other banks are not smooth.</p>
<p>Human Marked. In the morning market opening, the market atmosphere was flat and weak, and sellers in the market were extremely eager. The prices for each month fell by 2.3 cents. Although there was some covering of short positions, it was difficult to reverse the decline. In the afternoon market, the marked yarn continued to soften, with the price of third-grade yarn falling. The prices for each month fell again by 4.5.6.7 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 14,950 bales. Lichang sold 1,200 bales, Da Ji 900 bales, Gengfeng 800 bales, Yuanfengyiyu, Heshen, Hengyigong, Taizhenda, Yuantai, Changfeng, Yiyu, Yukang, and Tianlong sold 300 to 550 bales. Yu Da bought 1,550 bales, Shenchang 2,400 bales, Gengfeng 1,100 bales, Taisheng, Kangming, Dete, Cheng Dachangcheng, Shenda Tianchang, Diji, Senkang, and Yikang 300 to 550 bales. The human marked closing prices are compiled on the left.</p>

<p>November 1522 9 38750 February 1522 8 1400</p>
<p>Ordinary current sales The current yarn sales are still good. The total volume bought by each bank for the day was 1,780 bales. Among them, 300 bales were bought by the same industry. The market conditions were flat and weak. The most customers were from Sichuan, buying 1,085 bales. Guangdong bought 165 bales, the mainland bought 220 bales, Yunnan bought 60 bales, Haizhou bought 95 bales, Xiamen bought 35 bales, and miscellaneous banks bought 120 bales.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market is Stable and Strong</h3>
<p>The cotton market is still strong. This is because the weather is bad, with too much rain, leading to a firm market sentiment and a decrease in sellers. However, the trend of American cotton is still weak and declining, so there is also a lack of buyers. However, the bull force is getting stronger, but the large short positions still have no intention of covering. The overall situation of the cotton market is difficult to be optimistic, but the local weather is even worse, and most people are psychologically bullish.</p>
<p>Stable human marked. In the morning market opening, although the price of foreign cotton fell, the weather was not sunny, and the sentiment was firm. The prices for each month increased by 5 fen to 1 qian. The buying interest was still strong in the afternoon. Later, because the prices of third-grade yarn and cotton both fell, the sentiment was slightly loose. The price of third-grade cotton fell by 5-6 jiao, but the result was still an increase of 5 fen to 1 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 45,700 dan. Shenchang bought 7,100 dan, Mao Ji 5,500 dan, Rongxing 1,300 dan, Dachangcheng, Dafu, Dafeng, Changfeng, Tianchang, Yuda, Da Ji, Yuande, and De Ji bought 700 dan to 2,200 dan. Jifeng sold 2,800 dan, Yuanda 1,800 dan, Ruida 1,600 dan, Da Ji 1,600 dan, Hengyi 1,700 dan, Gongtai, Minghua, Qinfeng, Xinhua, Zhenda, Taixing, Jinfeng, Xinheng, Yicheng, Taichang, and Gengfeng, Yongfeng, and Shenji 1,000 to 1,600 dan.

<h3>Private Estimates of American Cotton Slightly Reduced</h3>
<p>According to the New York telegram on the 2nd, the Campbell Office announced that the estimated annual production volume was 54.0% of the normal year, totaling 14,664,000 bales, a decrease of 340,000 bales compared to the previous estimate (August 2nd). Also, the Foxwick Bureau estimated that the annual production volume was 58.4% of the normal year, totaling 13,740,000 bales, a decrease of 9,000 bales compared to the previous estimate (August 5th).</p>
<h3>Overseas Yarn and Cotton Markets Collapse</h3>
<p>There is still selling off in the American cotton South. Yesterday, the price of American cotton initially fell due to unfavorable news from Liverpool. It then strengthened due to cotton harvest estimates being favorable for the bulls, but it ultimately weakened again due to selling off in the South. Futures fell by 9 to 16 points, and spot prices fell by 10 points. The price of English cotton futures rose by 2 points, and the spot price fell by 2 points. The price of Egyptian cotton spot fell by 10 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 2nd).</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Markets Continue to Rise Due to Rain</h3>
<p>The volume from the river in Zhabei was still low yesterday. The market sales were minimal due to the rain, but the buying interest was still good. Because the merchants and customers realized that the inventory was low, they all raised prices, so broken japonica rice rose by about 2 jiao. However, there was still a shortage of high-quality goods on the market, and they were all in the middle. The situation was very good. Because of the rain, the price of Dongxin japonica rice was still hovering between 18 yuan and 18.5 yuan. Because the rain would delay the market introduction of Westxin japonica rice in the mainland, the trend was tight. Several cars of new Kejian were seen, and the buying interest was lively. The price was actually raised to 14 yuan and 6 jiao, a significant increase of about half a yuan. The cost of this type of goods was very low, and the shipping merchants made a large profit. The situation of Ziyuan was slightly better with a modest increase in price.</p>
<p>The volume from the river in South Shanghai was not large. The market sales were very slow due to the continuous rain, so there were few transactions in each shop. The market appetite for broken japonica rice was also minimal. The market situation followed the North Market and moved towards prosperity. The overall price rose by about 1 or 2 jiao. The market for Southern Bank thin rice was also extremely depressed. The supply and sales of the above two items were declining. The volume of Dongxin japonica rice was also low, and the market situation was similar to the previous market. The market for white yuan was not good. The price of goods from the inner roads was firm. Shipments to Shanghai decreased, and the interest in this area was also normal, so the price only firmed slightly.</p>
<h3>The Marked Flour Market Repeatedly Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the upper and lower afternoon markets for flour, the market conditions for each month were consistently weak. Because the quoted price for foreign wheat was low, at 7-8 jiao or 1 yuan, the bull side continued to order foreign flour from Tianjin, which would naturally reduce the sales channels for local flour in the future. The foreign firms have been quite active in soliciting business in recent days. It was heard that a customer was counter-offering 3.9 yuan for Citibank flour, and the foreign firms were contacting the matter by telegram. Therefore, people's morale was even more panicked. The lowest price for the current month fell back to 2 taels 5 qian and 2.5 li, a decrease of 2 fen and 2.5 li compared to the previous day. Afterwards, the empty covering was frequent, and the price recovered slightly, but most people's sentiment remained low and weak. As a result, the price for the current month was down 1.5 fen compared to the previous day, October was down 7.5 li, November was down 1.25 fen, December was down 7.5 li, January was down 1.25 fen, and February was down 1 fen.</p>
<h3>The Futures Wheat Market Trended Gloomy</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the upper and lower afternoon markets for futures wheat, the market conditions for each month were weak. Because the quoted price for foreign wheat was low, at 7-8 jiao to 1 yuan, and because the large bulls were gradually closing out their positions, the market atmosphere seemed to be trending gloomy. Because the supply of goods from each route was more smooth than when the new goods arrived, and there was no hope for a revival in flour sales, it was feared that the market would have to loosen a little in accordance with the environment. As a result, the price for the current month was down 2 fen compared to the previous day, October was unchanged, November was down 1 fen, December was down 1 fen, and January and February were down 1 fen. Because the factory appetite was sluggish, the asking prices for middle and lower grades of wheat in the spot wheat market decreased by 1 or 2 fen, while the asking prices for high-quality goods remained stable. 500 bags of Jiangxi wheat were opened in the Kaisha market, but they have not yet been allocated to the factories.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Daily Sugar Market Tends Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market report from producing areas indicated that the spot price of Cuban sugar remained at 1.21875. New York futures sugar prices were 1.14 for September, 1.22 for December, 1.34 for March of next year, and 1.43 for May. Compared to the previous report, only September and March showed a slight decrease of one point each, with no increase or decrease in other months. The spot price of Javanese sugar was 8.875, with futures prices at 8.75 for September and 8.625 for October, also lacking significant fluctuations compared to the previous report. The new price for November was 8.50. In the market coordinated by the guild, the market for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was calm, with very few transactions. High-quality white sugar in bags was priced at 8 taels, and finely ground white sugar reached 8 taels and 1 mace, with even quieter trading. Japanese sugar N mark was at 7 taels 9 mace, 1 mark at 8 taels 1 mace, TK mark at 7 taels 8 mace and a half, Minghua YT mark at 7 taels 8 mace and a half, YP mark at 8 taels, and TK mark at 7 taels 8 mace and a half, with relatively smooth trading. The market trend was firm. A transaction was reported by Jin Fa Hao, selling over a thousand bags of spot coarse granulated white sugar at 8 taels per bag, with a stable market. Hua Xin was reportedly selling off Dutch sugar, offering immediately loaded No. 20 medium granulated white sugar at a Dutch currency price of 5 yuan and 4 jiao and a half, new rules.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Jinhua's New Autumn Silkworms Will Soon Be Marketable</h3>
<p>Silkworm Ants Have Been Doing Well... A Good Harvest Is Expected</p>
<p>The Jinhua old prefecture in Zhejiang Province generally produces silkworms earlier than other places. This year, due to the government's promotion and distribution of silkworm eggs, everyone is engaged in hatching and raising them, and the amount of feeding is not small. The silkworm ants have been doing well, and they have now started spinning cocoons on the mounting frames. The new cocoons can be removed from the frames within a few days, and a good harvest is expected.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Autumn Silkworms: Early Broods Have Started Their Third Molt and Are Eating Leaves</h3>
<p>Leaves are Priced at Three Yuan Per Load</p>
<p>The spring and summer silkworm harvests this year were disappointing, so farmers are paying special attention to this autumn silkworm crop, and most are raising more. However, due to the silkworm egg varieties, there is a big difference in timing. The early broods have already started their third molt and are eating leaves, while the later broods are only in their first molt. The silkworms are in very good condition, and a good harvest is predicted. Mulberry leaves are being sold for 2.5 to 3 yuan per load, but no one is selling them yet, because nine out of ten families are raising silkworms.</p>
<h3>Lüzhuang Zhenmei Tea: Sales to England Show Slight Movement</h3>
<p>Recently, the Zhenmei green tea from Lüzhuang, as well as from the Yingzhuang Jinlong, Tianxiang, Yihé, and Tongfu firms, has seen renewed activity due to orders from overseas. Transactions are not quiet, but the opening market prices remain low and weak. As for Qining black tea, since the Russian firms stopped purchasing, the Yingzhuang firms have seen no interest, and the market is completely stagnant.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Eastern Goods Market Sentiment Wavering Upwards</h3>
<p>Cotton Cloth Sales Are Slower Than Before</p>
<p>Recently, the market for cotton cloth from our factory has been quite stable, but sales are not as brisk as before. This is because the peak season is over, and the dyed cloth market has been hit hard since the Sichuan gangs stopped operations. Demand from the north is also slow. Fortunately, inventories are low, so there has been no downward trend. However, fine twill is rising without falling, and spot goods were even scarcer yesterday. All those who had stocked up in this street have sold out, creating a near-shortage situation, so hoarding is rampant. Guangdong and Shantou gangs are still searching for fine cloth, and the trend is weakening. However, the Jixiang Ren Zhong and Balloon brands are consistently out of stock, while coarse cloth is softer, with 14-pound and 13-pound "flying" styles showing only a slight decrease of about 5%. Coarse twill is increasingly quiet.</p>
<p>The rising trend of Eastern and Western piece goods was even stronger yesterday. Fine broadcloth, straight tribute satin, and straight tribute damask from the East were soaring, especially fine broadcloth, which was the most volatile. There was a difference of about 5% between the morning and afternoon markets, which is an unprecedented and strange increase. The real ball was sold for 3 mace in the afternoon, Huxinting for 2 mace 6.5 fen, Yan Muqiu for 2 mace 5 fen 7 li and a half, and Baizi for 2 mace 6 fen, all up by more than 1 fen compared to the previous day. Straight tribute satin First Grade was sold at 3 mace, Four Scholars at 2 mace 9 fen and a half, and straight tribute damask was up another 2.5 li, but there were no major changes in patterned goods. The "Release the Carp" and "Longevity" straight tribute damask from Saigon also rose sharply yesterday, selling at 2 mace 4 fen, while the rest remained firm.</p>
<h3>Metals: Eastern White Iron Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 615 bundles (totaling 12,300 sheets) of Eastern white iron arrived at the Huishan warehouse, mostly seven-foot sheets. Exports have been lively recently, so various gangs in the Yangtze River and inland rivers have made some purchases. The Fuzhou gang emerged as a dark horse, purchasing a large quantity of 3,000 to 4,000 sheets yesterday. The price for 3' x 7' sheets was 1 tael 1 mace 2 fen and a half per sheet, and for 3' x 6' sheets, 9 mace 3 fen, reportedly up 1.5 fen compared to before. According to those familiar with this product, there is no scheduled arrival from Japan in the near future. If there are no arrivals within one or two weeks, the market outlook is bound to become more optimistic.</p>

<p>Sincere Company announces that since the price reduction, business has been very crowded, a rare sight. The prices of all goods have been reduced to the lowest limit. There are also Mid-Autumn Mooncakes with a long-standing reputation and a major clearance sale of glass and porcelain on the second floor, all of which are invaluable opportunities. In addition, newly arrived thick and fine precious furs, purchased by personnel, are of high quality and low cost. During the price reduction period, there will be further discounts. It is truly an opportunity not to be missed, etc.</p>
<p>Since the press has promoted sports, local customs have changed. Track and field events and ball games have aroused social interest. However, most sporting goods are imported, and the prices are expensive, making it difficult for those with limited means to purchase them. Mr. Zhang and his brothers, owners of Xie Xing Leather Factory in Youqing Lane, Min Ti Ni Yin Road, French Concession, Shanghai, are men of vision. Several years ago, they witnessed the huge outflow of money in this area and immediately began to oversee the production of vests, basketballs, footballs, volleyballs, and other sporting goods based on their research. After several improvements, they have won a reputation for "exquisite and inexpensive." Major companies and stores across the country are happy to promote and sell them. It is said that the factory has many new products that are difficult to distinguish from foreign goods when placed together, and the wholesale price is only 50-60% of the foreign price. Foreigners are also happy to use them, so sales are booming, and they are shipping goods day and night. They are still worried about not being able to keep up and plan to find ways to expand the factory site, etc.</p>
<p>Birode Company announces that their company's fountain pens are selling widely and have long been popular near and far. The reason is that the materials are excellent, the styles are novel, the prices are fair, and repairs are free, which have long been appreciated by people from all walks of life. As the summer vacation in the local schools ends and the autumn semester begins, they are specially reducing the prices in the retail department for three weeks to reward patronage. Unexpectedly, the number of pens, Chinese and Western stationery, and school supplies sold on the first day broke all previous records, which shows that the reputation of the company's fountain pens and stationery is indeed well-deserved, etc.</p>
<p>Dahua Hat Company on Wangping Street announces that their company has always adhered to the principle of small profits, so since its establishment, business has been thriving. Unexpectedly, they were careless this summer, resulting in a complete fire loss. Fortunately, before the accident, the company's manager, Chen Chaofang, had purchased fire insurance from Rennert, which can make up for the loss. Recently, a new house has been rebuilt on the original site, and the decorations have been greatly improved, with fresh paint, which can arouse customers' aesthetic interest. The internal layout is also ready, and transactions will begin on the 5th of this month. All kinds of new-style felt hats are sold at low prices to attract customers, etc.</p>
<p>Liang Chen Hao You She, at the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road, announces that Western-style cheap envelopes in decorated boxes are sold expensively by our country's stationery stores, and the profit outflow is even greater. Now, our society has newly launched a (desktop cheap envelope holder) to promote Chinese-style art cheap envelopes as a countermeasure. Each holder has double drawers with ribbon handles and exquisite decorations. The contents include two hundred Zhang of Hai Yue Kuo Liang Chen cheap envelopes and a hundred envelopes with three layers. There are twenty kinds of drawing boards in total. Each holder sells for two yuan. Recently, they have been displayed in front of the company, welcome to visit, etc.</p>

Since its opening, its low prices, exquisite products, and prompt handling have been praised by the banking industry. Those who entrust printing jobs can notify by telephone, and someone will come to discuss immediately, etc.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>Star Film Company announces that the news that Star's new film (Romantic Woman), which has been awaited for a long time, has been completely filmed has been spread, and moviegoers are all looking forward to the early screening of this film. Also, because this film expresses the moving nature of sensuality and depicts the enthusiasm of eroticism, and thoroughly declares a romantic life and a dark society, it is sufficient to open a new path for film art. Therefore, those who desire this film are inquiring about the screening date by letter every day. It is now said that this film has been scheduled to be released in the Central Grand Theater from the 6th, etc.</p>
<p>Shanghai Popular Lecture Hall, Xiaoximen, Zhonghua Road, announces that in order to promote public entertainment, the hall has specially added a drama department, and has appointed Yao Mingxin and Yin Jiumou to write and select scripts, which will begin rehearsals immediately, so that they can be performed in the cool of autumn. All preparations are currently underway, etc.</p>
<p>Changming Film Company announces that since the release of the first and second installments of The Burning of Pingyang City, the enthusiastic welcome from domestic and foreign audiences has opened a new record in the Chinese film industry that has never been seen before. Now, due to the requests of film distributors and audiences in various places, the third installment has begun shooting. However, in order to strive for perfection, we dare not be complacent. After a long period of consideration, hundreds of specially made costumes have been produced. The plot will integrate love, comedy, and martial arts in one furnace, with originality and not falling into old patterns. It is now being processed and rushed to be filmed, and it will be released soon. In order to reconcile the audience's tastes, a comedy blockbuster named (Two Great Heavenly Kings) is being filmed at the same time. The film has unique magic shooting methods, novel performances, and a sudden and funny plot. At present, the domestic film comedy item is the most lacking. The release of this film should refresh the audience, etc.</p>
<p>Paramount Pictures Company, Museum Road, announces that the film The Love Parade, published by the company, has been screened in several major theaters in the city for dozens of days, which is the longest record in the history of our country's film industry. Its box office success has been unprecedented even when it was released in Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong. The value of this film is unmatched by any film company's products. The enthusiastic welcome of The Love Parade by people from all over the world is due to the effective direction of director King Liu Bieqian, who is glamorous but not lewd, satirical but not hurtful, and appreciated by both the refined and the vulgar, young and old. It is also due to the suitability of the male and female leads, Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald, the thorough performance, and the clear singing, which are sufficient for people to watch once and again, again and again, and never tire of watching them. MacDonald's name has become a common phrase among general moviegoers. Now, Paramount Pictures Company has another fully colored musical dialogue film named The Smiling Lieutenant, also starring Jeanette MacDonald, with the male lead being Dennis King. MacDonald's expressions and singing have been praised by all those who have watched The Love Parade, and she has made even greater contributions in her new film. King is a famous stage actor in New York. He has rehearsed The Smiling Lieutenant on the American stage for more than a year before showing his appearance on the screen. Therefore, King starring in the film The Smiling Lieutenant is actually no different from re-enacting the stage play The Smiling Lieutenant. The scene in the film Colorful Flowers, which was previously shown at the Guanglu Theater and Dahua Open-Air Cinema in this city, in which a man sang a Russian love song on a colored background before going to the gallows, was taken from a section of The Smiling Lieutenant. The singer is King. The plot of The Smiling Lieutenant is based on the works of the 15th-century French poet François Villon. The short story writer McCarty used it to create a long narrative novel called If I Were King. Later, playwrights competed to use the novel's material to compile materials for stage dramas, and the opera world also arranged it into song plays several times, named The Vagabond King. Dennis King was one of the people who rehearsed it. Paramount Pictures Company re-adapted it into a film and hired the famous German director Lubitsch to direct it. Lubitsch has compiled and arranged fifty stage plays in Germany before joining the film industry. The musical film The Merry Widow is one of his directorial films. The music in the film was composed by three famous masters, William Bowstead, Berlin Hocker, and Rudolph Ming O, all of whom are outstanding figures in the world of cinema. In addition to the two important roles of Jeanette MacDonald and Dennis King, Warner Oland plays Duke de Polignac, the French Minister of War, Hugh Herbert plays King Louis XIV of France, Lillian Roth plays a street girl, and E. Alyn Warren plays the French King's comical barber. There are more than 2,000 other actors in the film. This film has now arrived in Shanghai and will be released after the autumn season, etc.</p>

He felt slightly better this summer, but recently, as the weather turned cooler, it suddenly flared up again, making it impossible for him to sleep at night, causing him great suffering. Later, he was told by a branch person that Yu Xuan's Jiu Ke Pian, sold on consignment by the Lixing Steamboat Bureau at the northern end of Pentang Lane Bridge in this city, is indeed effective for treating coughs.

<p>Youth Oasis</p>
<h3>Awakened Youth</h3>
<p>"Having knowledge is not about being old, lacking knowledge is wasting a hundred years." Now, I deeply believe this.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, thanks to Wang's introduction, I was very fortunate to meet an admirable youth, a very young youth. Before I was introduced to him, I had already encountered his writings. At the time, I only admired his fluent writing and vivid style, his broad knowledge and thorough thinking. Of course, "Is it possible to read his writings without knowing the person?" But in reality, there are many places where it is not easy to achieve this goal, and it is also something that cannot be helped.</p>
<p>Now we have met him. He is a handsome young man, no more than seventeen years old, with a slender figure and a face full of innocence. He is lively, but he does not lose his composure. His amiable expression naturally makes him approachable, and he is also skilled in rhetoric. From his conversations, I know that he has read quite a few books. I had dreamed of seeing such a young man who could produce such sophisticated articles. How could I not be amazed and ashamed of my inferiority? I admire him twelvefold, and at the same time, I sincerely pray that the Chinese youth will all be as excellent as him and that everyone will be as enlightened as he is, and that they will be thoroughly enlightened in time.</p>
<p>The knowledge that modern youth should have and their mission are important topics in the third issue of "Shidai Qingnian" (Era Youth). The author, Ye Demao, is the young man I admired above.</p>
<p>It is an undeniable fact that modern youth are wandering on divergent paths. We only see and hear of the increasing number of fallen youth, emerging almost like bamboo shoots after the rain. If this continues, what will be the fate of the future new society and the Chinese nation?</p>
<p>"But when we study the reasons for their downfall, we find that most of them do not understand the background of the current era and the special environment and crisis of China. They are often assimilated by evil forces and blindly follow them. To remedy this situation, we must give them a clear understanding of the current era so that they do not blindly follow. At the same time, we must instill a sense of national consciousness, so that they know the crisis of the Chinese nation, prompting them to awaken and return to the battlefield of life as brave warriors, saving themselves, seeking a way out for the nation, and creating a blessing for the future society. Finally, we must make them understand the responsibilities and missions of youth."</p>
<p>Without reading the rest of his writing, we can deduce the layout of the whole article. The author has a clear mind and far-sighted vision. He uses a scientific approach to find the root cause of the illness and prescribes the right medicine to cure the modern youth's ailment. As such, it differs from ordinary articles that only talk about the symptoms of the illness without finding the root cause of the pathology, let alone offering any conclusions. It can be said that they do not even prescribe licorice or platycodon, and the result is nothing more than a torrent of scolding, cynicism, or shallow sympathy. The author, however, is completely different. Therefore, he divides his argument into several stages: 1. The Transformation of the Era; 2. Economic Aggression of the Powers in China; 3. The Crisis of China: A. The Collapse of the Rural Economy; B. The Emergence of the Exploitative Class; C. The Decline of National Consciousness; 4. Our Responsibilities and Missions.</p>
<p>The author's writing style is exceptionally fluent, like the Yangtze River, flowing a thousand miles without stopping. Therefore, it is impossible to copy and paste the first three sections. If we take some from the east and then reluctantly give up some from the west, it would be better to leave the readers to explore on their own, rather than leaving out details and harming the original spirit of the text. However, I dare to guarantee that you will not be disappointed, and you will even applaud and say, "How enjoyable and thorough!"</p>
<p>Now, I will only briefly introduce the fourth section.</p>
<p>Oh, youth! The era has already arrived, and we can no longer afford to hesitate and wander at the crossroads, or stand high in ivory towers. We can no longer afford to degenerate. We must rise up and strive to promote national movements, taking national consciousness as the central consciousness, and extinguishing all evil forces that are non-nationalist or lack a central consciousness. Because the only and greatest crisis in China today is the decline of national consciousness and the rise of anti-national consciousness! Oh, for the sake of saving ourselves, for the sake of the future of the nation, and for the sake of the survival of society, we must promote our national central consciousness movement. This is our only great responsibility and mission at present! However, we must also recognize that the national consciousness we advocate is not the simple national consciousness advocated by the Germanic or Yamato nations, which aims only to invade other nations for their own benefit. We want all the weak and small nations of the world to rise up and determine their own future. This is a necessary understanding before we take on our responsibilities and missions. In a nutshell, our responsibility is to save China from its current crisis, and our mission is to take national consciousness as the central consciousness to take on all responsibilities.</p>
<p>Finally, I must declare that my motivation for writing this article is not to promote someone like a celebrity. I ask the readers and the author to forgive me. My purposes are twofold: first, to introduce (Shidai Qingnian) to you. It may offer considerable guidance and comfort to generally frustrated youth. Second, to introduce the author of this article to you, so that you may learn from and be inspired by him. It is also a small tribute to the author. (Jiezhi)</p>
<h3>Nanyang Model Middle School Adds Senior High School</h3>
<p>Jiao Tong University Stops Sending Junior High Graduates</p>
<p>Pre-Collegiate Program to be Abolished</p>
<p>Nanyang Model Elementary School was originally reorganized from the affiliated elementary and middle schools of Nanyang University. Therefore, its teaching spirit is still consistent with that of Jiao Da. Every graduating class (junior high school graduates) can be promoted to Jiao Da's pre-collegiate program. After the Ministry of Education issued an order for all universities to abolish pre-collegiate programs, the Jiao Da authorities immediately followed the order and prepared to abolish the pre-collegiate program. It was decided that this year's pre-collegiate program would not enroll new students, but the graduates of Nanyang Model Elementary and Middle School this year could still be promoted to the pre-collegiate program according to the contract. After next year, they would no longer be able to be promoted in this way, so as to gradually abolish it. By 1933, this resolution could be completely abolished. After this resolution was made, the issue of Nanyang's school relocation arose immediately. Students and their families petitioned the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Railways to allow them to continue operating without relocating. After receiving the petition, the Ministry of Education sent people to the school to investigate the situation and prepared a report, which was submitted to the ministry. The Ministry of Education believed that Nanyang was a private school, and Jiao Da was a national university. Private schools could not be promoted to national universities without an entrance examination. The Ministry of Education already had a clear order that even if the school had special circumstances and a contractual basis, it should not disregard the ministry's regulations. Therefore, it ordered the Municipal Education Bureau to order Nanyang not to guarantee the promotion of graduates, and at the same time, it directly informed Jiao Da not to accept them. As a result, the issue of Nanyang's promotion became a bubble. Despite all efforts, they could not succeed. Now, at the request of the students' families, the school has established a senior high school to prepare junior high school graduates for further education and to avoid the suffering of students dropping out of school. It is now ready, and most of the teachers are former teachers from Jiao Da's pre-collegiate program. For example, English is taught by Zhu Shuzheng, a former Jiao Da teacher, and mathematics is taught by Professor Zhang Lujing. All teaching methods are modeled after Jiao Da's pre-collegiate program to facilitate future entrance exams. This year, only one class of senior high school is being established, and no new students are being recruited. In the future, senior high school year two and three will be added gradually. After two years, the school can become a complete two-level middle school, etc.</p>
<h3>Jiao Da Establishes College of Natural Sciences</h3>
<p>Jiao Tong University previously received an order from the Ministry to add a College of Science to cultivate talents in materials testing and chemical analysis for various railway bureaus. After receiving the order, the school actively prepared. Initially, because the Nanyang school building was borrowed by Nanyang Model Elementary and Middle School, it repeatedly urged Nanyang to vacate the building in order to prepare for the site of the College of Science. Now, Nanyang cannot find a building for the time being, and Jiao Da's campus is large and does not lack a site. Therefore, it did not agree to return the building. Jiao Da could not wait for Nanyang to move out before starting the College of Science. Therefore, it was decided to establish the College of Science on the upper campus. The school already had very complete physical and chemical testing equipment. Therefore, there were not many difficulties in establishing the College of Science this time. However, because the railway bureau does not need many talents in physics and chemistry, the number of students is very small, only ten students per class. This year, the departments of Physics and Chemistry will be established first, and the departments of Mathematics and Geology will be added successively to complete the College of Science. Before the enrollment this year, the College of Science did not enroll students due to insufficient preparation for the previous enrollment. It is now scheduled to recruit ten new students at the Shanghai headquarters from September 7th to 10th. However, the school felt that the name "College of Science" was too common and changed it to the College of Natural Sciences, with the English name (Puro Science College). From now on, the school will have three independent colleges: Engineering, Railway Management, and Natural Sciences, with more than ten departments in total, which meets the requirements of the Ministry of Education's (University Regulations) and can be called a complete university. The enrollment time this time is late, and many people outside do not know the truth. In fact, the future career prospects of the students of this college are better than those of other colleges because the number of students is small and the demand is greater than the supply. It is said that the dean of the college is Xu Mingcai, the chairman of the Physics Department is Qiu Weiyu, and the chairman of the Chemistry Department is Ke Chengmao. Teachers will include Hu Dunfu, who will be hired, etc.</p>
<h3>World Girl Scout Conference</h3>
<p>— Junshan</p>
<p>The most surprising social phenomenon in modern society is the Boy Scout and Girl Scout movements. This movement is probably a very strong and promising form of communication in the international community today. When the Boy Scouts were first founded, they were greatly opposed by the generally conservative old gentlemen. When the Girl Scout movement developed, those old gentlemen were really speechless, thinking that they were born into the wrong world. But today, as far as we know, although the Boy Scout movement in the UK is well-developed, the Girl Scout movement is even more developed. The number of Girl Scouts in a country is even 100,000 more than the number of Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>This July, a World Girl Scout Conference was held at Foxlease Park in Hampshire, England. A total of 200 representatives from 30 countries attended. This was a very joyful and energetic gathering. Some of the representatives wore their national costumes and sang songs from various countries at the talent show. The conference decided that English, French, and German would be the official languages, but due to the prevalence of English, French and German were rarely used. Various issues of Girl Scouts were discussed at the conference, and the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts was also successfully established. Therefore, the results were very remarkable.</p>
<p>Sir Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Boy Scout and Girl Scout movements, also attended the conference. In his speech, he emphasized two points in particular: one is the value of the Girl Scout movement in the personality training of young people, and the other is the work that Girl Scouts can do in the international peace movement.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Male and Female Youths Promote Abstinence from Alcohol</h3>
<p>Commemorating the 8th Anniversary of the Great Earthquake</p>
<p>Tokyo News: Various public organizations of temperance and other groups in Tokyo, in order to commemorate the 8th anniversary of the Great Earthquake, launched a "No Alcohol Day" on September 1st, and held a lantern parade in Tokyo on the evening of August 30th, with 5,000 male youths and 500 female youths participating in the promotion of alcohol abstinence.</p>
<h3>Returning Home—Patriotic "Two"</h3>
<p>A. In terms of Moral Education: The quality of a school's ethos largely depends on its internal moral education, especially for girls' schools. The school's reputation is almost universally talked about. It goes without saying that Patriotic has a long history of thirty years and is trusted and admired by the general public. At the same time, the outside world has high hopes for it and is critical of it. In order to demand perfection, we sometimes heard criticism of Patriotic in the first half of the year, roughly saying that there were shortcomings in management and moral education. Indeed, it is no wonder that others discussed it, because the school's internal dormitories were insufficient, so many houses were rented in Tianbao Lane as off-campus dormitories. In fact, there were still resident teachers inside, which the outside world could not understand. Now, everything can be improved. According to Mr. Sun, the moral education strictly prevents being influenced by bad habits from the outside world. The current environment can indeed be lively and amiable in accordance with the regulations. I am not exaggerating, the daughters of Patriotic are indeed worthy of the name. Among the grade instructors and dormitory instructors who live on campus are Mr. Huang Shan, who is in charge of Boy Scout training, Mr. Shen Mingzhen, an expert in singing and dancing, Ms. Guan Suwen, a newly hired singing and dancing expert who graduated from Ginling Women's University, and Ms. Wei Xueqing, who is diligent and simple and very experienced in guiding students. There is also Ms. Chen Miaoming, who is proficient in English and piano, and Ms. Xu Junjing, who is rich in artistic talent. These ladies are all good teachers who are not easy to hire. With these ladies working together to promote moral education, they should not fail the high expectations of the outside world. In addition, with its beautiful location and beautiful gardens, it can be expected to create a new atmosphere. B. In terms of Academics: The level of each grade is greatly improved and the entrance examination is strict. There have also been slight changes in the academic aspects. Senior high school and year one have been changed to general subjects, and physical education has been changed to a three-year system. As for the teachers, it can be said that they have tried their best to recruit Ms. Nie Xiayu, a female elder who studied in the United States. Mr. Yu Jianhua is still the senior high school form teacher in year three, Mr. Li Tianxing is the form teacher in year two, and Mr. Sun Yimou is the form teacher in year one. The English teachers are still Mr. Su Zhaolong, Mr. Zhang Shian, and Mr. Hu Shangxin.</p>
<p>C. In terms of Facilities: The school site is appropriate and the various facilities are very suitable. The layout of the classrooms, desks, and chairs has been renovated, and the lighting is particularly sufficient. The library will be built with university library equipment, all of which will be purchased and retained. The gym is now under construction, located in Peach Garden. As for the beauty of the dormitories, it is rare to see in middle schools.</p>
<p>D. Patriotic has always had a history in literature and sports. I heard that the founder, Mr. Cai Zimin, and Principal Sun and Director Ji discussed and advocated using the power of literature to reform the thinking of general women and using educational methods to deeply serve society. They will convene a board of directors and educational experts to discuss specific measures in the near future.</p>
<p>Judging from this, it is not only gratifying for us married daughters to hear about it, but it is also good news for the future of women's education.</p>
<p>"Come and sit over there."</p>
<p>"Okay," I said, bidding farewell to Mr. Sun and walking towards Yu Shi's residence with him.</p>
<p>Oh, it's great. A purely Chinese-style single room, surrounded by trees, a yellow earth courtyard, a fence, and bean vines climbing on the fence, with purple flowers blooming. Outside the fence, there are many lush sunflowers, like a natural green screen. There are also a pair of spotless white geese and a pair of mallard ducks, adorning the unequal courtyard. Behind the house in the woods, there is also a clear stream, and looking over, you can see the "Hongkou Milk Shed" with many water buffalo. I said to Yu Shi, "This is just right for you. What a good painter." "Haha, I still have to learn to play the piano. I'll keep the stack to play to the cows."</p>
<p>This is the recent situation of our home. Our home has improved a lot, adding a lot of glory to us married daughters when we return to our husband's home. (Guangmei)</p>
