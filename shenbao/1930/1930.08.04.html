<h3>英美之救濟失業方法</h3>
<p>今日美電稱胡佛總統將召集會議考慮美國建造家宅及家庭主權問題爲失業民衆謀工作上之出路竊謂此僅救濟方法之一端耳至美政府對於失業問題之如何通盤計劃則迄今尙未有所聞也</p>
<p>至英國之失業問題情勢更爲嚴重據最近電訊失業人數已達一百九十七萬二千之高潮故其政府之焦慮亦較美國爲甚綜觀近日報紙零星之紀載其政府救濟方法約略可言一爲整理工業一般人以爲英國貿易之衰落乃世界經濟與商業進行上一時之頓挫英國工業果能澈底整理自有方法於世界巿塲上增進競爭之效率得漸達恢復目的然而此種失業現象是否暫時整理工業能否收獲向外發展之實效尙爲一疑問也一爲整理農業昨財政大臣在下院陳述政府補救農業政策謂將組織一機關辦理大規模農塲及訓練墾荒等事并說明可使小農夫與失業工人易得田地之方法然工農之間向來不易融洽如此整理能否即收實效亦一疑問也一爲整理殖民近來殖民部對於各殖民地之移民事業極力籌備亦爲其救濟失業之一政策然移殖僅可帮助减輕現在之失業情况而决不能視爲解决失業問題之工具總之今日各國雖各力籌救濟方法然而能通盤籌劃自信確有把握之方策實所鮮聞固不僅英國爲然也</p>

<h3>全歐近年之人口生産率</h3>
<p>美聯社倫敦通信全歐人口生産率經美國聯合通訊社之調查發現較戰前銳减但目下生産率仍越過死亡率故局面尙不足以引起歐洲各國當局之杞憂單以意在利而論生産率尙在繼長增高之中一般人均信此事由於意首相墨索里尼之鼓勵與勸誘以促其人民多生小意大利國民</p>
<p>依聯合通訊社之調查歐洲大多數國家均受制於以下所列之任何一種情形且有數國二者情形均有</p>
<p>一本國經濟情形太壞不足以使國家多支經費以鼓勵生産</p>
<p>二國民居住太密又兼失業者衆遂逼多數國民向國外遷移致使調查人口之官吏不能造人口迅速及徐徐增加之報告爲之蹙額</p>
<p>中歐各國對於上述兩種情形特感痛苦尤以匈牙利爲最該國於戰後改良土地章程施行後有農民七十萬人陷於無事可作嬉玩度日此外復加農業衰落迄今已有二十餘萬人失業</p>
<p>歐洲各國從他方面集中勢力於减嬰孩死亡率此舉已獲相當效果一般社會學家認此爲一線曙光依可靠統計而觀大不列顚及俄羅斯已在此種工作上獲得最大之進步英國之嬰孩死亡率在一八九六年爲一千嬰孩中死一百四十八人但在一九二九年已滅至一千人中僅七十四人俄國在一九一三年爲一千人中二百六十五人在一九二八年則減至一千人中一百五十五人德國生産率則大見低落在一○○一年其千分率爲一千人中有三十五·八在一九二九年則爲一千人中僅有十七·八此事已引起柏林大學著名社會學家葛羅堅氏之注意致使該氏擬向調查此種事件之委員會建議設立保障兒童敎育及健康之百年大計據聞此種建議在目下德國經濟狀况下不能實現因所費頗巨需數百萬馬克方能成功也</p>
<p>歐州各國對於節育一事所抱意見各不相同英國爲最大列强之一自一九一九年已禁止一般産科醫生作避孕方法之演講他方面俄國對於墮胎則經法律許可各種避孕方法一般民衆已家喻戶曉兹將呼國大略情形分别列後</p>
<p>备國德國對於以工爲生之未婚者課以百分之十所得稅已婚而未有子女者課百分之九所得稅已婚工人而有一孩者課百分之八在一九二九年中生者較死者多三十五萬人在一九○七年時平均每一對夫婦有子女四人但在一九二九年則約爲二人目下德國之人口爲六千萬據專家預測照此情形至一九七五年則將减至四千六百萬人</p>
<p>英國英國有四千一百三十一人從事於保護産婦及幼孩幸福之工作嬰孩死亡率因衛生敎育設備之進步已大形減低在英國雖無鼓勵金之規定但每一母親生一小孩則得國家健康保險慰勞金十元（美金下仿此）若其夫保有壽險則伊另得十元若父親死亡則母親本人每週收取撫恤金二元五角長子每週收取一元三角以次諸兒每週收取七角五分以待彼等各長至十四歲而後止一九一三年生産總數爲八十八萬一千一百三十人在一九二九年爲六十四萬四千二百一十人然則英國雖有工黨及工會聯合會兩團體主張國家撥三萬五千萬英金作爲補助家庭基金而官方則稱照目下經濟情形之艱窘殊不能接受此項之主張也</p>
<p>法國法國在一九三○年之最初三月生産超過死亡一萬零七百九十七人因醫院及敎育之改善致幼孩死亡率亦爲減低母親無奬勵金但若旅行則取費低廉若父親生有健康兒童至十四或十五人者有時可受國家榮譽奬章白蘭地酒奬品最高者值價二萬五千佛郎今仍奬給於人口最多最有價值之家庭</p>
<p>意大利貴族婦女與平民婦女於茶會時無不以育嬰爲談話資料此乃意相墨索里尼奬掖勸導所養成彼因鑒於本國生産率之下降爲國家衰微之兆深爲震驚乃於三年前開始鼓勵生育彼對於産婦給慰勞金并用種種方法鼓勵國民增高生産率照人口專家計算僅以本年之前半年爲基礎照此做去則至明年意國人口之總數將爲四千三百萬較之今年多六十五萬超過戰前之數平均每年五十萬人墨氏於一九二七年首將徵收未婚稅所得之經費撥作改善兒童報福及産婦設備之基金對於節制生育一端竭力取締旣禁止其宣傳復令藥房苟未得醫生之許可不准配賣避孕藥方之藥品墨氏常於各大城中保留欵項備作擴充公共事業之需并勸告官吏將來人口增加公共事業必有擴充之必要（未完）</p>

<h3>氣象研究所報告颱風經過途徑</h3>
<p>南京國立中央研究院氣象研究所報告民國十九年七月二十四至八月二日颱風經過之途徑云太平洋中之颱風（俗稱颶風）最盛行時期爲七八九月值兹七八月之交正颱風開始發達之時期也颱風發源於太平洋西部在緯度五度至十五度及經度一百三十五度至一百五十度之間初向西北運行繼乃分途進發有向吕宋而趨南海者有沿琉球島而東北向日本者此皆與中國各地無多影響不足稱道惟有颱風起自太平洋經台灣及琉球島而入東海或沿海濱而北上或由閩浙登陸而入内地在海面則白浪滔天沉舟覆艇登陸則狂風怒發毁屋傷人是颱風範圍所及之區域莫不大遭損害也全年温度本以七月份爲最高本年七月二十三二十四兩日本京温度竟高至攝氏表三十八度有奇合華氏表一百度零超過前兩年之最高紀錄當兹天氣最熱時期最易發生風暴（颱風即風暴之一種）蓋風暴之趨向最喜向熱地進行此次颱風前來或因此間温度過高之故亦未可知此次颱風已於七月二十四日發現於太平洋中初向西北進行繼轉西向至二十六日上午其中心逼近那霸之西南海面自日本南部至琉球羣島一帶始受風災火車停駛電信不通且傷害鹽田及農作物不少至二十七日其中心經過琉球島而入東海沿海濱一帶大受風災南北往來輪船停駛本京於是日晨及二十六日下午發生雷雨多次比爲颱風將至之先兆蓋颱風成旋渦運動範圍甚廣凡在其前進之邊緣上最易發生雷雨故也二十八日上午颱風中心在東海南部漸向西南西移動逼近台灣北部繼乃轉向西北行至下午二時臨温州附近自是長江下游風勢增强天氣惡劣此爲颱風逼近之表徵照例颱風次日可經過長江下游因受日本高氣壓之壓迫改變途徑退向西南行至是日下午由福州附近又轉向西北進推移至浙贛交界即在全華上饒之間遲遲不進者約三日蓋颱風之途徑自登國境後例向北及東北進行今因受北方高氣壓之阻斷以致遲遲不進故也本京於三十日受颱風轉行北上之影響天氣驟變狂風陣雨雷電交作全日雨勢斷續不已三十一日天氣仍然惡劣雨勢連綿風力不減可知颱風中心之逼近也至八月一日風勢頗强風向東北轉東南颱風將由江西九江附近向北進發但颱風雖猛烈然登陸日久受高山森林等之阻撓漸成强弩之末不致釀成鉅大風災也二日本京風向由東南偏南轉風勢漸減氣壓升高天氣轉佳可知颱風已離江西境而西北上矣</p>
<p>計此次颱風經過各地所受損害據報載二十六日東京電新瀉縣下信越鐵路岡上站附近之河川因大雨汜濫就地一帶變爲大海火車停駛以及青森秋田等縣電信不通民家流失狀頗慘澹云又據廿九日東京電今年爲颱風之年自台灣至九州方面連日被颱風之威脅鹽田及農作物被害最鉅云</p>
<p>又據滬報載廿九日風勢轉大海輪繼續停駛黄浦潮高漲兩岸低處水陸幾平又云日輪岳陽丸在吳淞口外遇風失事又有大華輪在浦江抛停之時爲風浪衝激而致撞損不能開行又云卅日晚間颱風暴至夜半更烈且有大雨浦江中重載貨船遭險者有三四起其受害情形多傷人沉船失貨云又據京報載卅日晚間下關江面船戶多謂旗竿及錨鍊均被迅雷擊斷云</p>
<p>今據漢口一日下午二時電稱武漢颶風江艦沉没甚多損失約在數十萬元左右其他沿海濱各地之損害惜無電報告無法紀述思其災情之重大當有甚於長江下游者也</p>

<h3>書報介紹</h3>
<p>讀民族主義文藝運動的使命文質</p>
<p>前鋒周報五六期</p>
<p>本來一個運動的發生自必有它抱負的使命這使命的宣示便是代表這運動自身的評價而且在一般人也是亟亟於需要去認識的實在唯其這種自我的解剖不單是爲着明白指出這偉大的運動所要努力突進的路向同時也是掀發一般人的堅强熱烈的同情使運動的力量得以積極的展開趕速突破那一切的障碍創造新的局面</p>
<p>自從民族主義文藝運動者描布了宣主和確立了鐵案般的理論中國的文藝界便顯然形成了一個新的現象於此使中國的文藝界由畸形狀態的進展中入於以全民族爲中心思想的意識路上了誰都知道處於這様一個苦難的時代四面八方丁着壓迫的痛苦一切祗有以民族的自决爲先决條件以民族的生存與進化爲當前的大問題在最近政治上的民族主義運動差不多已有它奮鬥的歷史然而畢竟因民衆對於民族意識之消沉類多麻木不仁其終於在正治上没有顯著的成效因之非得借助文藝的力量首先將民族的意識得注於民衆心底鞏固戰線一致爲民族而奮鬥不可政治與文藝是有密切的關係的政治可以影響文藝文藝也何獨不能影響政治所以今日文藝家的責任是絶對應以民族爲依歸　　在民族主義文藝運動宣言裏對於文藝上的民族主義運動的使命已經有這様嚴密的規定「（一）在形成文藝上民族意識的確立（二）在促進民族向上發展的意志（三）在排除一切阻碍民族進展的思想（四）在表現民族一切奮鬥的歷史」但雖這様規定了尙是没有明確的申說使一船的印象認識深刻自然大家都認爲是憾事的雖然接受了民族主義文藝的理論可是究竟民族主義文藝的内包是怎様還不免糢糊而不清切現在好了在民族主義文藝運動者創辦的前鋒周報五六二期上見到朱大心君的「民族主義文藝運動者的使命」關於民族主義文藝運動的使命有詳明的解釋了作者就是根據於宣言上提示的綱領加以闡發這實在是件必要的工程民族主義文藝運動更深進一層地發現了它的估價了</p>
<p>大文藝上喚起民族意識的覺醒就是要求整個民族中間的份子底思想行動團結一致以求全體的生存自由與進化目前大多數人對於民族與國家的意義往往解釋錯誤以爲「民族就是住在某一國的領土之内的人民」實非嚴密的剖别與矯正不可作者在這裏對民族的意義之認識是廣義的民族主義</p>
<p>在達到本身的生存進化自由的目的之外對於其他弱小民族不加以侵略或壓迫很明顯地認識各種民族都應該有自决的權利</p>
<p>在中國大多數人民對於民族意識的缺乏是不可諱言的事實大家只知爲個人求生存求幸福竟至摧殘民族的生存而不顧要知「缺乏民族意識的民族即不能認識個人和民族的關係即不能努力圖謀民族的生存與發展不知努力自存的民族受外族的侵略或壓迫即不令努力抵抗結果必致滅亡」至於這種民族意識消沉的原因一方面是專制政治的遺毒太深了統治者非常的壓制以致民族意識的集團行動簡直不能表現其次便是家族制度的變態的特殊發展而形成狹義的宗法社會尤其不幸的在民族意識消沉到如此地步的中國竟有人散佈了所謂階級意識分化整個的民族眞是陷民族於滅亡的窅阱阿</p>
<p>但是所謂民族是指全部的份子因这所謂民族主義的文藝當然是指從民族的立塲所形成的生活意識生的作品這裏作者這様指出「第一應注意流傳在民間的一切文藝而作定他們在民族的立塲上的價值在民間故事民間傳說民間歌謡之中很多有爲民族求生存求自由繁榮目的的第二對於民間的集會與娱樂應該加以一種剖析和利導如迎神賽渡等等舉動至少是有集團意識的表現組織和紀律的行動動的或前進的情態熱烈情感的表示這幾點符合於民族精神的都應該認清他們的意義而加以發揮第三對於過去智識份子的著作應該由民族主義的批評以重新估定他們的價值今後的著作應該站在民族的立塲創作必須以民族的全民衆爲對象利用着各種不同的技巧創出適應於民族的全民衆所能了解的形式」</p>
<p>第二個使命是發展民族向上的意志在中華民族不惟缺乏民族構成的主觀底條件的民族意識即是民族構成的客觀底條件的民族特性亦是日趨於墮落但今後像這一種情態决不能再允許繼續綿延下去了該要喚醒鼓勵民族向上的意志而進於優秀這自然以文藝的訓育最有力因爲文藝的敎育實在的意義是在敎養人人能夠把「創造的權力」「向上的意志」發揮出來這是孕育民族的「生命力一的原素作者在此提出我們的民族性至少應該是有「熱烈的感表情勇猛活潑的精神美的信仰建全的體格創造的能力組織的能力守秩序的習慣不屈不撓的意志」這在現在的中華民族爲適應生存與進化和趨於强盛起見是急需要的</p>
<p>第三個使命是在排除一切阻礙民族進展的思想目下中國文藝的各種紊亂的思想確是給充滿了紊亂不堪的狀態妨礙我們民族的進展最大的是並羅文藝運動其次是封建思想復次是頽廢思想是出世思想這幾種思想在民族主義文藝的主場是不能讓他們存在的必須竭力肅清</p>
<p>第四個使命是表現民族的奮鬥底歷史在過去中國雖曾受若干次的異族蹂躪而起反抗的波動但這絶不是中華民族的整個的民族運動僅是那些具有帝皇思相的英雄在滿足他們黄袍加身統攬天下的慾望而已與我們民族有甚麽關係因此「我們所要表現的除了民間傳說中所留下來的一部份含有民族思想的故事外便是時代的具有爲民族求獨立因由平等的目的底革命歷史了作者並指出今後應該盡量的吸收異族的文化來適應我們的需要但應注意「要自由的選擇自由的吸收絶對不容人家强迫我們受洗禮」這都是民族主義文藝中應該表現一切</p>
<p>看了這篇文字自然對於民族主義文藝運動更覺得廊開了一個光明而熱情的境界我之介紹也是這個緣故那末我們企求偉大的時代的到來吧</p>
<p>我們深信民族主義能夠深深貫注在全民族的各個份子的心理中中華民族才會達到我熟與優秀的目的同時中華民族的文藝方能臻於偉大不朽的境界</p>

Parts of the 15th, 19th, and 16th Divisions are moving from Xiangtan towards the Chenjiawan area of Lower Xiang River. The newly formed 31st Division is also reversing the situation. The vanguard of each army, about two regiments, had already gathered below Yuelu Mountain last night.

They are bombarding Zhongdao, and fighting is currently underway. (3rd Telecommunications Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou: He Jian's army concentrated its forces on the opposite bank of Changsha on the evening of the 2nd and then began crossing the river.

He Jian's army, which had already concentrated, launched a general offensive starting on the morning of the 3rd.

(3rd United Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3>He Jian Telegraphs the Circumstances of Abandoning Changsha</h3>
<p>Nanjing: He Jian telegraphed Tan Yankai on the 28th, saying: "Peng, Huang, He, Li, and Kong's bandit gangs have gathered more than 30,000 troops, attacking Changsha in three routes. On the 27th, around Shen Shi (3-5 PM), more than 8,000 bandits attacked around Qilixiang. The front still had more than 4,000 attacking, with one route of about 5,000 forcibly crossing from Huji and engaging our army in repeated hand-to-hand combat. In the end, the number of Communist bandits was too large, and after holding out until You Shi (5-7 PM), our various units suffered more than half casualties. The front retreated to the Wumeiling and Huangmeiling lines. Seeing the emergency situation, Jian personally went to Wumeiling to supervise the battle and block the enemy until Hai Shi (9-11 PM). Our army suffered even greater casualties, and because the disparity in numbers was too great, we were surrounded on all sides. At that time, Changsha city fell. Jian led a small number of guards through the Liuyang Gate, braving bullets to leave the city through the Xiaoximen, cross the river, and diverted to western Hunan, arriving in Yuanjiang this afternoon. The various units that were surrounded at the time also sent an engineering battalion to collect at Wulipai. Currently, part of the Wei Shi, the Li Brigade of the 19th Division, and part of the Tong Brigade have concentrated in Wujiawan and Zhuzhou. The Wang Dongyuan Brigade has withdrawn towards Yueyang. Afterwards, contact was lost with the various units fighting. Jian originally resolved to coexist with the province, so all provincial committee and provincial department personnel were in the provincial government and did not leave. All military materials were untouched. When Jian passed through the city, he heard loud gunfire from the provincial government. When crossing the river, he saw firelight illuminating the sky. I have nothing to face your excellency above and nothing to face the people below. I can only leave my daring body to temporarily retreat to western Hunan, await punishment, and then regroup my troops to recover Changsha and vow to destroy these fiends. However, the bandit forces are vast and cannot be ignored. Please quickly send heavy troops to quickly annihilate them, and please give me instructions to follow." In addition, Liu Pengnian, Chief of Staff of the 4th Route Army, telegraphed on the 1st, saying that the Communist bandits in Changsha are preparing to retreat to Pingliu. Liu Luo's Divisions and the Chen Brigade will launch a counterattack from Xiangtan, and Tao's Division and Dai's units will launch a joint attack from Ningxiang, working with Luo's Division to recapture the provincial capital soon. He Jian will advance from Yiyang to supervise the battle. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Methods of Unemployment Relief in England and America</h3>
<p>Today's American telegram states that President Hoover will convene a meeting to consider the issue of American housing construction and home ownership to create job opportunities for the unemployed. I believe this is only one aspect of the relief method. As for how the American government plans to comprehensively address the issue of unemployment, nothing has been heard so far.</p>
<p>The situation of unemployment in England is even more severe. According to recent telegrams, the number of unemployed has reached a high of 1,972,000, so the anxiety of its government is also greater than that of the United States. Looking at the scattered records in recent newspapers, its government's relief methods can be roughly divided into three: first, to reorganize industry. Generally, people believe that the decline of British trade is a temporary setback in the world's economic and commercial progress. If British industry can be thoroughly reorganized, there will be ways to increase the efficiency of competition in the world market and gradually achieve the goal of recovery. However, whether this unemployment phenomenon is temporary and whether the reorganization of industry can achieve outward development remains a question. Second, to reorganize agriculture. Yesterday, the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated in the House of Commons the government's policy to remedy agriculture, saying that it will organize an agency to handle large-scale farms and train reclamation, and explain how small farmers and unemployed workers can easily obtain land. However, workers and peasants have always been difficult to reconcile, so whether this reorganization can immediately achieve practical results is also a question. Third, to reorganize the colonies. Recently, the Colonial Department has been actively preparing for immigration projects in various colonies, which is also one of its policies to relieve unemployment. However, immigration can only help reduce the current unemployment situation and can never be regarded as a tool to solve the unemployment problem. In short, although countries are striving to find relief methods today, there are very few who can plan comprehensively and confidently. It is not just England that is the case.</p>

Recently, important military figures have been sending telegrams to the office, either saying that they have made great contributions to the revolution or that they have a deep history in the party, and should be invited to join the Expanded Conference. The members of the Expanded Committee feel difficult to accept or reject, so they have to leave it for future discussion. It is said that quite a few members of the Expanded Committee are following Wang to Shi to meet with Yan on the government affairs. It is said that the Expanded Committee declaration on the 7th will be more than 3,000 words long, describing the seven basic conditions in detail, explaining the Prime Minister's National Assembly proposal, and the future restoration of democratic politics, which was personally drafted by Wang.

The reason for this move is likely due to the tense situation between Turkey and Persia.

<h3>Former King of Egypt Plans to Return Home to Seek Restoration</h3>

<h3>Japan and France Conduct Air Combat Exercises Amidst Calls for Peace</h3>

<h3>The Seiyukai Dispatches Teams to Begin Economic Investigation</h3>
<p>Government Closely Monitors</p>
<p>Conflicts May Be Unavoidable</p>
<p>The Dentsu News Agency reported on the 3rd from Tokyo that the Seiyukai began dispatching economic investigation teams to various locations today. The government is paying close attention to this and has secretly instructed local officials that any instigating words or actions should be immediately suppressed. The reason is that the deepening of the recession is a global trend and not something that Japan can solve alone. Therefore, only through consistent austerity by officials and the people can a future leap be achieved. People who have become overly sensitive due to the hardships of life are most easily swayed by rumors. The Seiyukai's economic investigation is a good thing, but the fact that it is dispatching a large number of people even though there are branches across the country is unfathomable. Therefore, its symposiums, lectures, etc., should be closely monitored to prevent local people from being incited. At times, sending people to follow is unavoidable. It is expected that the Seiyukai's economic investigation team will inevitably cause considerable conflict in the region after its departure. The Seiyukai is already very angry about this and claims that anyone who wants to suppress it should listen to its pleas.</p>
<h3>Labor Unrest Widens in France</h3>
<p>The National News Agency reported on the 2nd from Paris that workers in Roubaix and Tourcoing in northern France have declared a general strike, involving another 20,000 people. In Hazebrouck, all 4,000 workers have also decided to go on a general strike on Monday.</p>
<h3>Annual Trade of England, France, Germany, the United States, and Japan Plummets</h3>
<p>The Dentsu News Agency reported on the 3rd from Tokyo that, according to a survey by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the import and export trade volume of the world's five major countries in the first half of this year has decreased sharply compared to the same period last year, with Japan being the most affected. The rates of decline are as follows: "Exports" England 15.0, France 8.4, Germany 5.1, United States 18.7, Japan 28.7 Japan 28.0. "Imports" England 10.4, France 12.4, Germany 16.6, United States 24.1, Japan 26.4.</p>
<p>The Dentsu News Agency reported on the 3rd from Tokyo that, according to the Ministry of Finance's announcement, Japan's foreign trade balance for July was 114,725,300 yuan for exports and 100,491,500 yuan for imports, resulting in a surplus of 12,338,800 yuan. The main export goods were raw silk at 39,457,700 yuan, thread fabrics at 19,367,700 yuan, and silk fabrics at 6,134,400 yuan. The main imports were cotton at 10,727,700 yuan, wool at 9,842,200 yuan, and iron at 7,642,200 yuan. The most important export, raw silk, decreased sharply by more than 28,000,000 yuan compared to the same period last year.</p>
<h3>Population Productivity Rates in Europe in Recent Years</h3>
<p>Associated Press London Correspondence A survey by the Associated Press has found that population productivity rates across Europe have declined sharply compared to before the war, but currently productivity rates still exceed mortality rates, so the situation is not enough to cause concern among European countries. Italy alone is seeing continued growth in productivity. It is generally believed that this is due to the encouragement and persuasion of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, who is urging his people to have more little Italian citizens.</p>
<p>According to the Associated Press, most European countries are subject to one of the following situations, and several countries have both:</p>
<p>1.  The country's economic situation is too bad to allow the state to spend more funds to encourage productivity.</p>
<p>2.  The national population is too dense, coupled with a large number of unemployed people, forcing the majority of the population to migrate abroad, causing officials investigating population growth to frown because they cannot create reports rapidly or gradually increasing the population.</p>
<p>Central European countries are particularly painful about the above two situations, especially Hungary. After the implementation of land reforms in the country after the war, 700,000 farmers were left with nothing to do, and more than 200,000 people have lost their jobs due to the decline in agriculture.</p>
<p>European countries are concentrating their efforts on reducing infant mortality. This has been quite successful. Social scientists generally recognize this as a glimmer of hope. According to reliable statistics, Great Britain and Russia have made the greatest progress in this work. The infant mortality rate in England in 1896 was 148 deaths per 1,000 infants, but in 1929 it had decreased to only 74 per 1,000. In Russia, in 1913, it was 265 per 1,000, and in 1928 it decreased to 155 per 1,000. The rate of productivity in Germany has greatly decreased. In 1901, its rate was 35.8 per 1,000, but in 1929 it was only 17.8 per 1,000. This has attracted the attention of Grojian, a famous sociologist at the University of Berlin, causing him to propose to the committee investigating this matter the establishment of a century-long plan to protect children's education and health. It is said that this proposal cannot be realized under the current economic situation in Germany, because it costs a lot of money and requires millions of marks to succeed.</p>
<p>European countries have different opinions on the matter of birth control. England, as one of the largest powers, has banned general obstetricians from giving lectures on contraception methods since 1919. On the other hand, abortion is legally permitted in Russia, and various contraceptive methods are known to the general public. The general situation of each country is listed separately below:</p>
<p>Germany: Germany imposes a 10% income tax on unmarried people who work for a living, a 9% income tax on married people who do not have children, and an 8% income tax on married workers who have one child. In 1929, there were 350,000 more births than deaths. In 1907, the average number of children per couple was four, but in 1929 it was about two. Currently, Germany's population is 60 million. According to expert predictions, at this rate, it will decrease to 46 million by 1975.</p>
<p>England: England has 4,131 people engaged in protecting the happiness of pregnant women and young children. The infant mortality rate has greatly decreased due to advances in health education equipment. Although there are no bonus regulations in England, every mother who gives birth to a child receives a national health insurance allowance of 10 yuan (USD, the same below). If her husband has life insurance, she gets another 10 yuan. If the father dies, the mother herself receives a weekly pension of 2.5 yuan, the eldest son receives 1.3 yuan per week, and subsequent children receive 0.75 yuan per week until they each reach the age of fourteen. The total number of births in 1913 was 881,130, and in 1929 it was 644,210. However, although the Labor Party and the Trade Union Federation both advocate that the state allocate 350 million British pounds as a family subsidy fund, the government claims that it cannot accept this proposal due to the current difficult economic situation.</p>
<p>France: In the first three months of 1930, production exceeded deaths by 10,797 in France. The infant mortality rate has also been reduced due to improvements in hospitals and education. There is no reward for mothers, but travel is inexpensive. If a father has healthy children up to 14 or 15 years old, he can sometimes receive the National Medal of Honor. Brandy wine prizes worth up to 25,000 francs are still awarded to the most populous and valuable families.</p>
<p>Italy: Noble women and common women at tea parties invariably talk about raising babies. This is cultivated by Prime Minister Mussolini's awards and exhortations. He was deeply shocked by the decline in the country's productivity as a sign of national decline, so he began to encourage childbirth three years ago. He gives allowances to pregnant women and encourages citizens to increase their productivity in various ways. According to population experts, based only on the first half of this year, if this continues, the total population of Italy will be 43 million by next year, which is 650,000 more than this year, exceeding the pre-war number by an average of 500,000 people per year. In 1927, Mussolini first allocated the funds collected from the unmarried tax to improve the welfare of children and equipment for pregnant women. He made every effort to suppress birth control, banning its propaganda and ordering pharmacies not to dispense contraceptive prescriptions without a doctor's permission. Mussolini often reserves funds in major cities for expanding public utilities and advises officials that as the population increases in the future, public utilities must be expanded.

<h3>Seventeenth International Maritime Law Conference</h3>
<p>Convened in Antwerp</p>
<p>The National News Agency reported on the 2nd from Brussels that the 17th International Maritime Law Conference was convened in Antwerp today.

Germany sent a delegation of nine people to attend.</p>
<h3>British Airship Subjected to Another Inspection</h3>
<p>Still Not Suitable for Regular Transatlantic Flights</p>
<p>Reuters reported on the 2nd from London that the British airship R-100 underwent another inspection yesterday in Montreal. According to the Department of Aviation, there were no structural defects in the airship, but the fabric of the wings was cracked quite a bit and is currently being repaired. Large-scale flights are unlikely to be made in Canada. Even the planned flight over Ottawa on the 5th of this month will be postponed. The crew is currently receiving a formal welcome in Montreal and has received many congratulatory guests. However, Captain Colmore believes that the public should not overemphasize this flight, as it is merely a demonstration of the effectiveness of a clumsy, flat-nosed airship. According to the opinion of the entire crew, this ship is still not suitable for the needs of regular transatlantic air service. Sir Dennistoun Burney, who built the ship, believes that running a transatlantic service will require airships twice the size of the R-100 and capable of traveling 85 miles per hour.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<p>○ The Rickshaw Coolie Strike in Qingdao Has Been Resolved Qingdao Correspondence After the rickshaw coolie strike in Qingdao, the Kuomintang and government parties caused an undercurrent due to misunderstandings. Each held their own views and reported the events to the central government. Now the strike has been resolved, and the disputes between the Kuomintang and the government are being mediated impartially by the central government. Recent news is recorded below:</p>
<p>Investigation of Both Labor and Capital According to the Qingdao rickshaw business, there has been an organization of rickshaw coolies since the Japanese occupation era. After our country took over, it was changed to an industry association. The number of rickshaw businesses (half Chinese and half Japanese) is 286, with each business having from several to dozens or hundreds of rickshaws. The average value of each rickshaw is around 90 yuan. Donations are paid in four installments each year, with three yuan per installment. The reason for the increase in rickshaw rental this time is because the price of gold has soared and the various repair parts are expensive, so it is requested that the rental price per rickshaw per day be set at 40 cents. Under the leadership of the Kuomintang government, a rickshaw coolie union has been established. The total number of rickshaw coolies is more than 2,500. The daily income of rickshaw coolies in peak months (official designated April, May, June, July, August, September as peak months, October, November, December, January, February, March as off-peak months) is about 1.5 yuan per day. In off-peak months, it is 1 yuan or 8-7 cents. The daily living expenses must be at least 4-5 cents.</p>
<p>Mediation of the Strike On the third day after the strike occurred, the city government's Public Security Bureau and Social Affairs Bureau jointly formulated temporary measures. The daily rickshaw rental was temporarily set at 38 cents, which was announced and implemented on July 25. Coolies were ordered to resume work immediately. At that time, about one-third of the coolies obeyed the order and resumed work. About half resumed work on the 26th, and now all of them have resumed work. On the 29th, the Public Security Bureau released more than 80 rickshaw coolies who were arrested with lighter offenses, such as Yang Yueyou. Dozens of those with more serious offenses are temporarily detained in the bureau for questioning. The families of the unreleased coolies are given 40 cents each per day as a living allowance to show sympathy. If no other incidents occur, bail can be taken and released within a few days. This brings an end to a disturbance.</p>
<p>The Central Government Mediates the Kuomintang and Government Disputes After misunderstandings arose between the Kuomintang and the government parties due to the strike, Central Committee member Zhang Daofan happened to be in Qingdao and tried his best to mediate and persuaded both parties not to go to extremes and to wait for the central government to resolve the matter. The Minguo Daily no longer publishes articles on labor-capital issues and Kuomintang-government disputes. Dai Jitao, the Minister of Training of the Central Government, also sent a telegram summoning Li Yizhong, the chairman of the City Guiding Committee, to Nanjing to inquire about everything. Li has already boarded a ship south on the 30th. As for the central government's resolution of this dispute, it has been decided to mediate the matter and order both parties to work together in harmony and not to engage in fratricide to provide an excuse for others. The telegram from the Central Propaganda Department to the City Kuomintang Headquarters is recorded below: "I have received your telegram about the dispute. The Central Committee has decided on mediation measures. The Department has telegraphed Mayor Ge to restore the freedom of the Minguo Daily and the Minbao so that they can be published as usual. It is hoped that all comrades will adhere to the principle of consolidating the rear and wait for the central government to mediate to avoid being exploited by rebellious elements and giving outsiders a reason to criticize us. Ye Chucang, Liu Luyin, and Yan Yin" (July 31).</p>
<h3>Tan Daoyuan's Division Assists in Suppressing Jiangxi Bandits</h3>
<p>Dai and Zhu's Brigades Recapture Gao'an</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence The chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government and commander-in-chief of the Ninth Route Army, Lu Dipin, has discovered that the communists Zhu and Mao are colluding with the Huang and Luo bandits to capture Xingan, Qingjiang, and Gao'an counties. He has now established defensive works in various important locations in Nanchang, Jiujiang, and Ji'an to consolidate defenses, and has ordered Zhang Huizan's Ying division to be distributed along the Gan River, Fuzhou, Ji'an, Xiajiang, and Zhangshu to encircle and suppress the bandits. He has also telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chiang, Dean Tan, Chief of Staff Zhu, Director He, and Commander-in-Chief Liu to request additional reinforcements to Jiangxi to assist in suppressing the communist bandits. Chiang and He have already ordered Li Baobing's brigade, which is coming down from Hubei, to land in Xunyang and advance to northern Jiangxi, and have also sent a division of troops from Nanjing to the province. According to provincial government news, Commander-in-Chief Chiang believes that Feng and Yan's successive defeats have made the front-line battle extremely smooth, and Jiangxi is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, making it a very important area. Therefore, he ordered a part of the 50th Division of the Ninth Route Army, led by Tan Daoyuan, to return to Jiangxi to suppress the bandits. Chief Tan telegraphed the province yesterday reporting the situation of his departure. It is estimated that he will arrive in Xunyang today. As for the Dai Yue and Zhu Yaohua brigades that advanced to suppress Gao'an, it is reported that they recaptured Gao'an yesterday. The Luo and Huang bandits retreated from Yifeng and attempted to flee to the border of Hunan and Hubei. The order in Nanchang is very good, but commerce has been quite depressed due to the influence of the communist bandits. The financial depletion is also unprecedented. (July 29) ○ The Recent Decline in Business in Guangdong Province Imports and exports have decreased by half compared to last year. The Influence of Expensive Gold and Cheap Silver and the Civil War. Guangzhou Correspondence Recently, the world's expensive gold and cheap silver have had the greatest impact on our country, which still uses the silver standard. The largest port in the country for foreign trade has also suffered the greatest losses. According to the previous month's (June) exports from this province, raw silk was 6,815 piculs, twice-reeled silk was 2,797 piculs, cocoons were 481 piculs, silk fabrics were 300 piculs, soybean cakes were 393 piculs, cassia bark and twigs were 6,223 piculs, tea was 1,626 piculs, tobacco leaves were 1,252 piculs, native cloth was 1,043 piculs, firecrackers were 11,282 baskets, grass mats were 649,280 pieces, and floor mats were 3,427 rolls. Imported goods included 72,738 pieces of foreign cloth, 9,625 piculs of Japanese cotton yarn, 420,744 gallons of kerosene and gasoline, 54,320 tons of coal, 15,650 piculs of metal products, 54,265 piculs of flour, 19,329 piculs of peanuts and red beans, 717 piculs of tanned cowhide, 746,655 ounces of raw silver bars, and 31,767 piculs of sugar. In total, exports in June decreased compared to the same period last year. Taking the first half of July, exports of raw silk were only 2,439 piculs, while in the first half of July last year, exports were 5,769 piculs. Exports of silk fabrics, cassia bark, and twice-reeled silk decreased by four-tenths, and native paper decreased by more than three-tenths. On the import side, imports of cowhide in June last year were 1,615 piculs, while imports in June this year were only 717 piculs, less than half of the same month last year. Imports of soybeans last June were 62,882 pieces, while imports in the same month this year were less than one-third. The reasons for the sharp decrease in imports and exports compared to last year are: first, the silk and salt industries have declined. In previous years, Guangdong's silk production was worth tens of millions, and the annual salt trade was also substantial. This year, due to cheap silver and expensive gold, the silk industry is unprofitable, and the salt industry has declined due to the civil war. With the reduction in transactions in the above two industries, the funds lent by silver businesses have also decreased, resulting in an oversupply of silver and expensive gold and cheap silver, which are closely related to commerce. Because the more silver there is, the higher the price of gold, and the higher the price of gold, the more expensive foreign goods become, and the purchasing power of the people decreases sharply, resulting in a slump in commerce. This is the reason for the decrease in imported goods. In addition, the civil war has affected Guangdong Province. The military has been using troops for many years, and military spending is huge. The burden on merchants and people is too heavy. Public bonds and treasury bills have been sold, and various stacking taxes have not been abolished for a while, resulting in a decline in the business of various industries. This is also the main reason for the sharp decline in exported goods. (July 26)</p>

<p>beneath them, there is the establishment of a rickshaw coolie union, with a total of more than 2,500 rickshaw coolies. The daily income of rickshaw coolies in peak months (officially designated April, May, June, July, August, and September as peak months; October, November, December, January, February, and March as off-peak months) is approximately 1.5 yuan. In off-peak months, it is one yuan or 80-70 cents. Daily living expenses require at least 40-50 cents.</p>
<p>Mediation of the Strike On the third day after the strike broke out, the City Government's Public Security Bureau and Social Affairs Bureau jointly formulated temporary measures, setting the daily rickshaw rental temporarily at 38 cents, which was announced and implemented on July 25. The coolies were ordered to resume work immediately. At that time, about one-third of the coolies obeyed the order and resumed work. Approximately half resumed work on the 26th, and now all have resumed work. On the 29th, the Public Security Bureau released more than 80 rickshaw coolies who were arrested for minor offenses, such as Yang Yueyou. Dozens of those with more serious offenses are temporarily detained in the bureau for questioning. The families of the unreleased coolies are given 40 cents each per day as a living allowance to show sympathy. If no other incidents occur, bail can be taken and released within a few days. This brings an end to a strike.</p>
<p>The Central Government Mediates the Kuomintang and Government Disputes After misunderstandings arose between the Kuomintang and the government parties due to the strike, Central Committee member Zhang Daofan happened to be in Qingdao and tried his best to mediate, persuading both parties not to go to extremes and to wait for the central government to resolve the matter. The Minguo Daily no longer publishes articles on labor-capital issues and Kuomintang-government disputes. Dai Jitao, the Minister of Training of the Central Government, also sent a telegram summoning Li Yizhong, the chairman of the City Guiding Committee, to Nanjing to inquire about everything. Li has already boarded a ship south on the 30th. As for the central government's resolution of this dispute, it has been decided to mediate the matter and order both parties to work together in harmony and not to engage in fratricide to provide an excuse for others. The telegram from the Central Propaganda Department to the City Kuomintang Headquarters is recorded below: "I have received your telegram about the dispute. The Central Committee has decided on mediation measures. The Department has telegraphed Mayor Ge to restore the freedom of the Minguo Daily and the Minbao so that they can be published as usual. It is hoped that all comrades will adhere to the principle of consolidating the rear and wait for the central government to mediate to avoid being exploited by rebellious elements and giving outsiders a reason to criticize us. Ye Chucang, Liu Luyin, and Yan Yin" (July 31).</p>

<h3>Chen Guohui Captures Huyang</h3>
<p>Tens of Thousands of Villagers Flee, Local Militia Surrounded</p>
<p>A Xiamen dispatch dated the 1st reports that Chen Guohui, since seizing Yongchun last December, has expanded his power. All districts of Yongchun have been reorganized under the Republic of China, except for Huyang, which is known for its wealth and strong militia. Their weaponry includes over 800 new-style rapid-fire rifles and two machine guns seized from Ye Dingguo, who was in charge of the 16th detachment. Chen dared not offend them for half a year after entering Yongchun. Recently, internal disputes arose within the militia, leading to deep disagreements. The Yongchun market widely uses credit notes issued by the Xinhui Bureau, known as "white tickets," which are essentially informally issued banknotes by merchants. Huyang Village Council resolved to prohibit the use of white tickets, but militia leader Liu Zikuan opposed this ban. On July 21st, Ruiji Xinhui Bureau of Wulijie, Yongchun, sent a person with 750 yuan in credit notes to Huyang to distribute remittances from overseas Chinese. Huang He, the village head of Huyang District Militia, detained the person. Liu Zikuan opposed, saying that the use of currency should be free and not prohibited. The conflict escalated to armed conflict. Liu dispatched militia soldiers and five or six hundred villagers to surround the council. As the internal strife intensified, Chen Guohui seized the opportunity and suddenly launched an attack on the 23rd, personally leading elite troops from Chen Yucai, Peng Tonglin, Shang Xuan, and Li Zuyi's battalions, over a thousand men in total, attacking Huyang from multiple directions. That day, they captured Tiantou, burning over twenty houses. On the 24th, they captured Xianxi, confiscating dozens of militia weapons and burning dozens of houses. The Huyang militia, seeing the external threat, urgently tried to resist, but it was too late. On the 25th, they captured Longshan. On the morning of the 26th, they attacked Taoyuan, and by 6 p.m., they advanced and captured Huyang, burning over two hundred houses, killing over three hundred villagers, and seizing seventy or eighty guns. Over twenty thousand Huyang refugees fled. The Xianyou County government alone has already taken in seven or eight thousand. The militia is surrounded in the Longshan and Jimi blockhouses, and by the 29th, they are still holding out, and if no help arrives, they will likely be disarmed. When Chen began attacking Huyang, the militia and the Yongchun County Committee urgently appealed to Fang Shengtao. Fang and Zhang Zhen, the commander of the newly formed First Division, each sent urgent letters to stop him, but to no avail. Fang then sent another urgent telegram to stop him, which was also ineffective. Following this incident, Huyang militia representatives Liu Jumin and Guo Qixiang, along with Liu Chengqing, a standing committee member of the County Committee, all went to Quanzhou to seek help from Fang. At the same time, the Yongchun County Committee and others sent a telegram to those at home and abroad, saying, "On July 23rd, the bandit Chen personally led the bandit troops of Peng Tonglin, Shang Xuan, Li Xiong, Chen Yucai, and others, totaling over a thousand men, to launch a large-scale attack on Huyang from Xianxi and Longshan. The local defense force, together with the people, desperately resisted, but due to the vast disparity in numbers and the wide defensive line, key points were captured, and they suffered successive defeats. Villages such as Xianxi, Longshan, Jimi, Taoyuan, Qingbai, Fengyang, Hucheng, and Penglai were successively captured. By the evening of the 26th, the entire Huyang had fallen into the hands of the bandits. It is estimated that no less than several hundred men, women, old, and young were killed, and no less than several hundred schools and houses were burned. Countless livestock and property were looted. Tens of thousands of disaster victims have fled into neighboring counties, the sound of weeping shakes the heavens, and blood flows all over the ground. The burning, killing, and looting are still ongoing. Although special envoys from Fang Shengtao and Commander Zhang have sent letters to stop them, they have been ineffective. The Yangzhou massacre cannot compare to its brutality, and the Yang Yuan catastrophe is not enough to describe its tragedy. Anyone with blood and qi cannot but feel pain. If this great bandit is not eliminated, the disaster in Fujian will not end. We hope that all sectors will uphold justice and jointly launch an attack to save the lives of the people and bring peace to the region. Yongchun will be fortunate, and the people of Fujian will be fortunate. Urgent plea, we humbly ask for your compassion. Yongchun County Party Affairs Steering Committee, Yongchun County Jinxiu District Office, Yongchun Overseas Association, Xiamen General Chamber of Commerce, Xiamen Yongchun Association, respectfully."</p>
<p>The National Government has rescinded the arrest warrant for Chen, transferring Chen's troops to serve in the anti-Lu forces, under the command of Military Commissioner Fang Shengtao. Fang is now deeply saddened by the ineffectiveness of his efforts to stop Chen's troops, which has led to this tragic incident. On the 28th, he also issued a letter to the elders and brothers of Huyang, which reads as follows: "Respectfully, I am writing to you because Mr. Liu Chengqing and Mr. Liu Jumin came to describe the situation in Huyang, which is extremely heartbreaking. Shengtao originally intended to return home to eliminate harm for the elders of our village, but this tragic event occurred in the middle of the journey, and I was unable to stop or rescue it. I am filled with shame. I only hope that the elders and brothers of our village will consider the difficulties of the overall situation and be patient for a while. At present, the first priority is to seek a good aftermath settlement. I have entrusted Mr. Liu and others to bring 5,000 yuan and instructed Brigade Commander Lin to take care of the resettlement nearby. Shengtao will personally rush to Yongchun immediately and then to your village to find a solution. If the subsequent settlement can be as desired, then there is still time to remedy the situation. If not, then Shengtao will apologize and await the government's judgment. I earnestly hope that the elders and brothers of our village will consider my humble intentions and wait a little longer. A meeting is imminent, and I will explain everything in person. I have written these few words in place of a face-to-face meeting. Respectfully, Fang Shengtao."</p>
<h3>Major Flood Disaster in Liaoning Province</h3>
<p>A Shenyang dispatch reports that since July 13th, continuous heavy rain has fallen in the province. The low-lying streets of the provincial capital are all like lakes. Nearby, the water level of the Yunhe and Liaohe rivers has risen sharply, flooding many fields. In the areas of Xinmin and Baiqibao along the Beining Railway, the rapid rise of the Raoyang River and Liu River has washed away over a thousand hectares of farmland. The forty-first iron bridge west of Raoyang River Station was washed away in three or four sections. The express trains from Shenyang to Pingxi were completely blocked on the 16th and 17th. Subsequently, the engineer from Huanggu Village led craftsmen to rescue. Engineering offices at nearby stations also arrived upon hearing the news. With over a thousand workers in total, the bridge was repaired on the evening of the 17th. Just as they were about to test the opening of the line, the water flow was too rapid and it was washed away again. Fortunately, the 18th was sunny, and repairs were finally completed by the evening. During the fierce wind and rain, all long-distance telephone and telegraph lines from Shenyang to various places were completely interrupted. The sections between Qingyuan and Ying'e on the Shenyang Road, as well as between Shanchengzi, Meihekou, and Xi'an in Jilin, all experienced obstacles due to flooding, and all passenger and freight transport on the entire line was suspended, with no set date for resumption of traffic, resulting in extremely heavy losses. Furthermore, the Department of Civil Affairs had previously telegraphed sixteen counties including Shenyang, Liaoyang, Jin County, Changtu, Yingkou, Yixian, Muxi, Xinmin, Faku, Haicheng, Taian, Panshan, Tongliao, Tieling, Liaoyuan, and Liaozhong, requesting reports on river levels and whether they had been affected by the disaster. According to the reports received so far, several counties have been affected, with Xinmin County suffering the most severe disaster. Details are as follows: (1) In Xinmin County, the Liao, Pu, Liu, and other five rivers have flooded, affecting over a hundred villages and approximately thirty thousand disaster victims. (2) In Xifeng County, many newly built dikes have been submerged. The Xiaodong City Gate facing the water was washed open, and strenuous efforts were made to block it, preventing water from entering the city. Two sections of the city wall west and east of the Danan City Gate were washed open. Due to the rapid water flow, it was impossible to block them, and the water in the southwest corner of the city was two or three feet deep. Fortunately, no danger occurred. However, several dozen households and over two hundred rooms collapsed in the southwest area outside the city, and many women and children were drowned. (3) In Faku County, areas in the second and third districts near the Liao River were submerged by rising water, and many paddy fields along the river were flooded. Other small rivers also had rapid currents, and some crops were also flooded. Investigations are still underway. (4) In Panshan County, only the third district of the entire county was not affected by the flood. All other districts were affected by the disaster, with the sixth district being more severely affected due to its low-lying terrain. (5) In Shenyang County, the Hun River near the city had a stable water level. However, in the seventh district north of Shenyang, the Liao River overflowed its banks. The Yunhe River in the commercial area of Yiba was once in a state of emergency on the morning of the 17th. Fortunately, the weather cleared the next day, and the water level gradually stabilized, temporarily avoiding danger. A corner of the city wall at the Daxi City Gate collapsed due to rainwater seepage, injuring four pedestrians. Many other houses also collapsed, and it is difficult to estimate the total number at this time. (6) In Liaoyang County, the river level rose by over three feet. Residents along the river have been ordered to guard the dikes and prepare over twenty thousand hemp bags to prevent emergencies. (7) In Liaoyuan County, there has been no major damage. (8) In Yixian County, the river level rose, but fortunately, there was no major disaster. (9) In Haicheng County, the river did not flood thanks to the dikes that were repaired this spring. (10) In Liaozhong County, although the river level rose, there was no damage because the dikes had been repaired to a higher level earlier. It is reported that because the disaster situation in Xinmin County is severe, the Department of Civil Affairs instructed the county to take extra precautions, properly resettle the disaster victims, and telegraphed Commander Zhang of Huludao while reporting to the provincial government, requesting the official silver bank to promptly allocate relief funds to help the disaster victims.</p>
<h3>Detailed Report on the Major Arms Case Cracked in Shenyang</h3>
<p>A Shenyang dispatch reports that the Shenyang County Public Security Bureau recently seized a large quantity of arms in the Feilong Machine Factory in Laoguabaozi, as reported in a previous dispatch. The following is a detailed report on the investigation: Previously, the Shenyang County government had received an order from the Commander-in-Chief's Office, stating that the French Consul Ge Libang had written a letter stating, "This office has approved the request of Bao Keshu, manager of the Feilong Machine Factory, and will accordingly handle the approximately 450 kilograms of Bristol explosive tablets stored in the factory. It has also reported that '1,000 pounds of Your excellent explosive tablets are currently stored in our warehouse at Shenhai Station. An investigation reveals that the medicine is an explosive substance, and it is not appropriate to store it in a densely populated area for a long time. Therefore, we respectfully request your office to sell it on our behalf and also store it on our behalf. We would be most grateful.'" Upon receiving this order, the county government immediately dispatched personnel to investigate. According to Bao Keshu, he claimed that he had been instructed to investigate the storage of explosives and other items in a warehouse near the Shenhai Road by the Feilong Machine Factory. Bao Keshu stated that these eight boxes of Bristol explosive tablets, each containing 50 pounds, totaled 900 pounds, priced at 3.3 yuan per pound in alloy tickets. The medicine was purchased in Tianjin during the 16th year of the Republic of China by the late Governor Wu of Jiangsu Province with a passport issued by the headquarters, in preparation for manufacturing 50,000 mortar shells. The remaining items were subsequently used by the Jiangsu Provincial Police Department to manufacture some small mortar shells. Due to storage inconvenience, they were stored near the Shenhai Road with the permission of the Shenhai Road Police Department to prevent danger. They were now moved to Laoguabaozi Village after Qin Yutian, the warehouse keeper, negotiated with Village Head Wang in the village and obtained permission from the office. Furthermore, according to Chief Li Zhen of the County Police Department, on November 2nd of the 17th year, Patrolman An Li of the Market Police Station reported that a Russian named Bulinkman lived in the courtyard at No. 2 Liaozhong Street in the market. He claimed to be the manager of the Feilong Machine Factory and had contracted with Chen Hongyou, the supervisor of the Jiangsu Provincial Garrison, to manufacture mortar shells. A telegram was sent to Jiangsu Province, and Chen Hongyou replied that it was true that his office had ordered shells from the factory and temporarily stored them there to avoid danger. Later, fearing accidents, they were repeatedly evicted. Finally, Qin, the caretaker, found a suitable house in Laoguabaozi Village with Qin Ziqing on March 12th of the 19th year before moving to the village. He claimed that he had obtained permission from the office. However, he did not know which agency had permitted the move to Laoguabaozi Village. Upon inquiring with Section Chief Shen of the Foreign Affairs Department, he replied that no permission had been granted. In summary, the factory's claims were not supported by the facts. Therefore, because explosives are dangerous goods, special attention should be paid to prevent accidents. Furthermore, the machine factory had moved to Laoguabaozi Village without authorization, and the local Village Head had permitted it without authorization, which was improper. It was urgently ordered that the county should immediately dispatch personnel to investigate the origin of the factory's move, strictly supervise to prevent accidents, and report the handling situation to be examined. Upon receiving the order, County Magistrate Wang Jiarui immediately instructed Zhang Detang, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, to lead more than ten policemen to Laoguabaozi on the 24th, together with the attached troop of the local garrisoned soldiers and the village heads, to investigate Qin Ziqing's house. Qin Ziqing claimed that one of the three rooms in his house, the one on the west side, was used as an explosives storage room. He was a worker at the Feilong Machine Factory. The factory manager was French, Bao Keshu, and the manager was Chinese, Song Heling. The factory was established in the 15th year of the Republic of China behind the Youyi Garden on Sanjing Road in the provincial capital's commercial area. On the ninth day of the ninth lunar month of the 17th year, Manager Song rented ten rooms from a Wang family on Fenghai Road to use as a warehouse for about a year. Then, because the landlord wanted to live there himself, on February 1st of the 19th year, the shells, medicine, and other items were moved into the civilian house. At that time, the Village Head Wang Xingjiu and the neighbors had explained and permitted it, and there was a rental contract. The rental period was for four months from February 1st to July 1st of the 19th year, and the rent was 72 yuan in silver. Subsequently, the bureau director and others opened the explosives storage room and found: (1) 272 boxes of light mortars (each box containing 24 shells, except for one box containing 17 shells); (2) 18 boxes of Bristol explosive tablets; (3) one box containing four large mortar shells; (4) 11 small iron boxes of mortar propellant packs; (5) three boxes containing 12 small boxes of black powder; (6) eight boxes of aircraft bombs, each box containing 40 bombs; (7) 33 discarded shells; (8) 27 blank shells; (9) one box of unfinished 7.9mm bullets; (10) 30 7.9mm bullets; (11) 13 boxes of small fuses (for shells); (12) 60 boxes of blank fuses; (13) six bottles of various colored medicines of various sizes; (14) 290 bullets; (15) 27 aircraft bombs; (16) 16 hand grenades; (17) one box of various fuses. After the inspection, the items were sealed and guarded by the Village Head Wang Xingjiu, Du Xing, and San Kanguan. More than twenty police officers were dispatched to guard the area. The house owner Qin Ziqing, Village Head Deputy Wang Xingjiu, Du Xing, He Lu, He Zhenhai, and Yang Zhenlai were taken back to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. On the afternoon of yesterday, Bao Keshu and Song Heling visited Wang Jiarui and Zhang Detang at the County Government and the Public Security Bureau. Wang Jiarui also reported the progress at the Prime Minister's Memorial Week at the Provincial Government yesterday morning and paid a visit to Military Director Rong at the Border Affairs Department to seek instructions. The Provincial Government instructed on the 29th to dispatch personnel to conduct another investigation with Director Zhang to determine the disposal method. Qin Ziqing and the other six, who had been detained, were sent to the County Government Court for questioning last night. There were no major issues in their testimonies. They can be released after finding guarantors. The County Government has reported the situation to the Commander-in-Chief's Office to await review. (January 30th)</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>Preliminary Points of the Civil Code's Chapters on Inheritance and Family (Continued)</h3>
<p>Review Opinions of the Central Political Council</p>
<p>Fourth point: Marriage age. The marriage age should be 18 for males and 16 for females. (Explanation) The marriage age varies widely from country to country due to differences in climate and customs. Therefore, the highest marriage age for males is 21 and the lowest is 14. The highest marriage age for females is 18 and the lowest is 12. It is a common practice in most countries for the marriage age of males to be slightly higher than that of females. However, Austria sets it at 14 for both males and females. Recently, the Soviet Russian Civil Code also stipulates that the marriage registration is permitted only when both males and females reach the age of 18, which seems to be in line with the meaning of equality. However, the development of the bodies of males and females varies from early to late, which is a natural physiological phenomenon and should not be forcibly leveled by human efforts. This article compromises the systems of various countries and stipulates that the marriage age is 18 for males and 16 for females, which is also suitable for the national conditions of our country. However, this article stipulates the minimum limit for the marriage age of males and females, that is, those who do not reach this minimum limit should be absolutely prohibited from marriage. As for the age of male and female marriage autonomy, it is not within the scope of this issue, so it is omitted. Fifth point: Restrictions on marriage of relatives. The following relatives may not marry: 1. Direct blood relatives and direct in-laws; 2. Collateral blood relatives and collateral in-laws whose generations are different, but this restriction does not apply to collateral blood relatives beyond the seventh degree of kinship and collateral in-laws beyond the fifth degree of kinship; 3. Collateral blood relatives whose generations are the same and within the sixth degree of kinship, but this restriction does not apply to cousins. (Explanation) The prohibition of marriage of direct blood relatives is the same both in China and abroad. Although there are exceptions for direct in-laws (Soviet Russia and some states in the United States), most countries prohibit it. The scope of prohibition for collateral blood relatives and collateral in-laws varies from country to country, and is narrower than that in our country. According to the old laws of our country, all members of the clan are prohibited, and there is almost no limit to the scope. However, the restriction is narrower for external relatives and relatives by marriage than for clan members, and the disparity is already significant. Now, after deliberating and weighing the advantages and disadvantages between Chinese and foreign legal systems, those that were not prohibited in our country in the past are still not prohibited, such as the proviso in the third paragraph of the principle, cousins. For those that were excessively prohibited in our country, the scope is reduced, such as the second paragraph of the principle, collateral blood relatives and collateral in-laws whose generations are different. The intention is to liberalize. Furthermore, the restrictions on marriage of blood relatives also apply to illegitimate children and their descendants. In addition, the restrictions on marriage of in-laws also apply after the termination of the relationship of in-laws. These are all in line with the legislative examples of most countries. In addition, there is more than one reason why intermarriage should be prohibited. Among them, there are those who are not relatives but are slightly similar, such as (1) the relationship between adoptive parents and their adopted children; (2) the relationship between guardians and their wards. It seems that the legislative examples of foreign countries should be slightly followed, stipulating that marriage is not allowed during the existence of the relationship or before the termination of the guardian's responsibility. All these points belong to detailed provisions and are not included in the principle. Sixth point: Marital property system. (1) The marital property system should be set as both statutory and contractual systems. (2) The statutory system should be a joint property system. (3) In addition to the three types listed below, the contractual system may stipulate other systems: 1. Community property system; 2. Unified property system; 3. Separate property system. (4) The husband and wife may choose one of the contractual systems as their marital property system by contract. (5) If the husband and wife have not entered into a marital property system by contract, the joint property system shall naturally apply. (6) After the application of the contractual system (except for the separate property system) or the statutory system, in certain specific circumstances, the separate property system shall naturally be changed according to the declaration of the court. (7) After the application of the contractual system, during the continuation of the marriage, the husband and wife may change to another contractual system by contract, which must be subject to appropriate conditions. (Explanation) The marital property system is specified in detail in the civil codes of various countries, and the standards vary greatly. There was no such provision in the old laws of our country, and there were no property contracts between spouses. In recent years, the legal thinking of the people has gradually developed, and they should follow the trend and determine several systems to allow them to agree to choose one, and those who have not agreed to choose one should apply the statutory system. According to the provisions of the civil codes of various countries on the marital property system, they vary according to the circumstances of their own countries, the types are different, the advantages and disadvantages are mutually visible, and some of the provisions are complex and difficult to apply. Based on the concepts of ownership, management rights, disposition rights, usufructuary rights, and debt relations, the marital property system is broadly divided into the following five types: 1. Unified property system; 2. Community property system; 3. Joint property system; 4. Dowry system; 5. Separate property system. The contents of each system on the right can be briefly described based on its characteristics: (1) Unified property system. Both parties' property is concentrated on one party, the husband. The ownership of the property brought in by the wife is transferred to the husband, and the wife only has the right to request a return (in the current legal systems of various countries, only Article 199 of the Swiss Civil Code uses this as a contractual system).

<p>The Case of Robbery and Assault by Bandits in the Western Countryside Recently, robbery cases have occurred frequently in the rural areas of our county, and especially in the jurisdiction of the 8th Sub-bureau of Public Security in the Third District (Yangming Township). Unexpectedly, the Wang Family Workshop in the 61st Map of the district is about one mile away from Nanqiao Town, and the residents there are densely populated and fairly lively. Wang Zhujun, a resident there, is in his forties and once served as a director in the township. His family is well-off and has some savings, which unfortunately aroused the covetousness of bandits. On the night of the previous (2nd) day, at around 1 o'clock, more than ten bandits suddenly arrived. Because the front and back doors of Wang's house were tightly closed, it was difficult to enter. They climbed over the high walls from the outside and entered. The bandits were armed with guns, sharp knives, wooden clubs, electric batons, and homemade bombs. Shouting in a strong northern accent, they first broke into Wang Zhujun's room. At that time, Zhujun had already woken up from his dream and was seized by the bandits, who forced him to reveal the location of the stored silver. They then rummaged through boxes and chests in a thorough search, but found nothing. The bandits then broke into the room of Zhujun's eldest son, Yuzhong, dragged Yuzhong and his wife from the bed, and forced them to hand over silver, jewelry, and ornaments. They then beat Yuzhong severely with wooden clubs, causing him to suffer serious injuries all over his body. Afterwards, the bandits recklessly looted for about half an hour. Finally, each carrying their stolen goods, they opened the front door and fled. The total value of the stolen items, including silver, clothes, and jewelry, is estimated at 890 yuan. Yesterday morning (3rd), at around 1 o'clock, Wang Yiting, the patrol leader of the Nanqiao Police Station, led police officers to investigate. They apprehended two suspected robbers in the vicinity of Dasong Tomb and temporarily detained them. At the same time, they captured another suspect, Xu Shunlang from Jiangyin, in the Xu Laiqiao cool shed, and recovered an electric baton and a sharp knife on the ground. They immediately took them all back to the bureau for strict interrogation. They confessed that there were several other accomplices, who were currently staying at the Huisheng Inn in Tantou Lane outside the North Gate. After hearing the confession, Patrol Leader Wang led police officers and the suspect to the inn to search at around 3 o'clock. In room 23, they found two suspicious women, Zhang Gongshi (also known as Xiaomei, 21 years old) and Gu Shi (33 years old), and recovered a small package of smuggled goods. They immediately took them to the 5th Sub-bureau for temporary detention. While continuing to strictly pursue the bandits, they received a tip-off at around 6 o'clock that several bandits were staying in room 24 of the Huisheng Inn. They had gone out to the market the previous night and returned to the inn at this time. Upon hearing the report, Patrol Leaders Wang and Huang immediately went to the inn to carry out the arrest. They arrested five robbers on the spot: Zhang Yutong, Wang A'er, Wang Baochu, Chen A'da, and Wang A'da. They recovered a paper (written in pencil) with the division of spoils, a gold ring (branded Fu, weighing 5 qian), a silver ring, and a pawn ticket from Zhang Yutong's body. They recovered several homemade bombs next to Wang A'er. Valuables and jewelery were also recovered from Wang Baochu, Chen A'da, and Wang A'da. Patrol Leader Wang and his team brought all the arrested persons, including the two women apprehended earlier, back to the 8th Sub-bureau. Wang, the head of the Sub-bureau, opened the court for preliminary interrogation. Zhang Yutong and Wang A'er confessed to the crime of gathering a crowd to rob Lianjia Village and other villages without denial. The other robbers hesitated in their confessions. After the interrogation was completed, they prepared a document and transferred them to the county government for investigation and handling according to law.</p>
<p>Moreover, in Zhangzhenqiao Xiazhaochang Township, Wan'an Market (16th District), four villagers, Liu Diangou, Gao Jinfa, Gao Jinbao, and Gao Jingen, were suddenly robbed by eight bandits wearing blue cloth short shirts at around 9 o'clock on the night of the previous day while they were cooling off and settling accounts for water scooping on the threshing ground. They were robbed of 4 yuan in silver dollars and some small silver coins. The bandits were greatly angered by the small amount of the robbery and beat Diangou on the back, causing injury, and fired a handgun, hitting Jinfa in the left leg before escaping. Afterwards, his elder brother, Gao Bingfa, hired a boat to accompany him to the Brother Hospital in the city for treatment. According to the doctor at the hospital, the leg bone was broken and the kneecap was damaged, and he would likely become disabled in the future.</p>
<p>Chen LunKuei Arrested and Taken to the County, Residents of Anzhen in the 8th District of Chen LunKuei County Were Previously Wanted and Captured and Sent to the Suzhou Higher Court last Winter in Rugao Port, but Last Month, the Court Found Him Not Guilty, but the Sealed House Has Not Yet been Officially Appealed.

<p>Continuation of Summer Harbor Armed Robbery and Police Injury: This newspaper previously reported the armed robbery and injury at the First Police Station of the Fifth Public Security Bureau in Summer Harbor, west of the city, on the 31st. It has now been learned that the bandits, numbering about fifty, arrived from two directions that evening and robbed the police station of its weapons. The incident resulted in the death of gatekeeper Jiang Guisheng and servant Xia Yaochun, and the injury of patrol officer Liu Yaohua. Eleven rifles and four Mauser pistols were stolen. Patrol officer Huang Hongchun and patrol chief Zhao Huisheng escaped without injury. The robbers stole over one hundred yuan worth of goods and silver from the Pan Zhengxing family's store. At the time, about thirty bandits guarded the streets and main roads with guns and posted reactionary slogans everywhere. By the time the city received the news, Director Li had led a team to the countryside, but the bandits had already fled west. Yesterday (the 1st), Huang Shude, the district chief of the area, and others went to the city to meet with County Chief Li regarding the gun robbery and post-security issues. In addition to scolding them, County Chief Li promised to instruct the Public Security Bureau to take precautions. The Western Township Office sent a telegram to the Provincial Government's Civil Affairs Department, stating that Director Li of the Public Security Bureau was incompetent and that banditry cases had occurred repeatedly since he took office without any being solved. The major case of the Summer Harbor robbery demonstrates lax defense and negligence in police affairs, and they requested his dismissal and investigation to restore local order.</p>
<p>Declaration of Temporary Martial Law: Fortress Commander Yang Yunhua and County Chief Li Lengxian believe that the bandits are cunning and, according to orders from superiors, they must strictly guard against local ruffians colluding with wounded soldiers to cause trouble.

Hongsheng's younger brother, Honggen, who was suffering from cholera, saw Xie wearing military trousers and was so frightened that he died that night. The Shengang Fifth Public Security Bureau was then notified and apprehended Xie Xizhao and others. Xie claimed to be a recruiter from the Second Bureau of the Micro-Recruitment Section of the First Division Command, recruiting soldiers in Summer Harbor. He stated that Yang Baochang went in, but he did not enter the Liu family's house. He was transferred to the General Bureau for interrogation and detention on the first day. Comforting Wounded and Sick Soldiers: The Twenty-Fifth Rear Hospital moved to Jiangyin Shifang Temple.

The weir contained more than 350 mu of farmland, and the harvest is hopeless.</p>
<p>Fast Boat Seized and Burned by Bandits: Bandit forces have expanded near Liju Peach Blossom in the western part of the county. Yesterday (the 2nd), at about 9 AM, a fast boat en route to Changzhou was attacked by bandits, who drove the passengers ashore and set the boat on fire.

<p>Who Exactly is Wang Zhongchi? A hostel in the northern part of the city, welcomed the arrival on the first day of Wang Zhongchi from Hubei, Wei Hanchen, and a young woman from He County who stayed in rooms 21 and 22. They claimed to be from the Investigation Department of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, acting on the orders of Adjutant Cai and Chen from the General Headquarters, to investigate a certain case in Cheng. In the morning of the second day, they contacted Gao Weimin, the commander of the military police company. Gao replied in a letter that he had introduced Director Li and that if there were official matters, please contact him directly. He also said that he could not comply due to matters at 10 AM and that Chief Inspector Wu had resigned and was away on other matters. Wang then went to the Public Security Bureau to speak with Director Li, saying that he needed to ask He Jinhai, Yin, and three other friends in the Foot Company, and No. 27 Junshan Lane for money. Li, believing that He et al. were all local peddlers, kept Wang in the bureau to examine his passport, which was a 17-year certificate, Guest Certificate No. 286 from Headquarters. A detective team was sent to Five Places outside the North Gate to search, but nothing was found. Doubts arose as to whether Wang Zhongchi was genuine. He was sent to the Fortress Command by the county government, and a telegram was sent to the Headquarters to inquire whether there was such a person and to verify the matter further.</p>

However, due to last year's disaster, the people in various counties are hesitant and observing, or due to the disturbance of bandits, most of the households have fled. In addition, the counties under Lishu have not been able to implement it effectively due to military influence. The six-month period from February 10th to August 9th is about to expire. The Finance Department originally intended to punish them separately according to the regulations, but according to the reports of the various counties, all the situations are true. It is now proposed to extend the deadline by three months from August 10th. Within this extended three-month period, the department will urge progress and carry out the matter on schedule.</p>

All the donations for July were still paid by Gao's family. Now, because Gao has passed away, his family has appealed to the Finance Bureau, but their request was not approved. It is reported that the newly appointed merchants are unwilling to cooperate. Yesterday (the 1st), the Finance Bureau again ordered Gao's family to pay. The dispute is significant, and it is unknown how it will be resolved.</p>

Guo, the company commander, and Zhu Zhongnan, the squad leader, upon hearing the news, immediately led the team to pursue and suppress them. After two hours of fierce fighting, three bandits were killed, and the bandit forces retreated due to their inability to withstand the attack. Fortunately, twenty members of the County Security Patrol Team were temporarily stationed in the village of Hui Ao. The squad leader, Sun Yue, with his small number of soldiers facing a large number of bandits, stubbornly defended the village entrance and killed one bandit leader, Ah Chun, on the spot, and injured several bandits. The bandits fled towards Naraiki village and robbed more than a dozen stores, causing losses of several thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>

The boats headed towards Dongtang Bridge. After the district chief, Shang Baoshan, inquired about the whereabouts of his son from Liu Xiaojiuma, she said that she had not returned for several days and did not know his whereabouts. The commune immediately sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau and the Security Team stationed in the district to investigate.

<p>Salt Merchants Request Reduction in Cigarette Treasury Coupons: The Liangzhe Transportation Office received an order from the ministry to raise 250,000 yuan in cigarette treasury coupons. It immediately ordered the Zhejiang Salt Association and salt merchant leaders such as Huang Changfu to allocate and recognize the coupons based on their quotas. It is now learned that the salt merchants of Liangzhe have been summoned to a meeting, and they all believe that they have already recognized and raised a large number of central and local public bonds in recent years, and that the current allocation of 250,000 yuan is difficult to bear. Yesterday, they specifically requested the Transportation Office to find a way to reduce the allocation so that they could pay the quota. Budget for Construction Expenses for This Year: The Zhejiang Construction Department has drafted the preliminary budget for construction expenses for this year and sent it to the Finance Department for compilation.

He had been living in Hangzhou for a long time. This year, he was introduced by Ye Xuezai to serve as the Adjutant of the 19th Rear Hospital in Bengbu. He had a wife and son, but his son recently died, and he was disheartened and resigned from his position as Adjutant. He returned to Hangzhou a week ago. Yesterday (the 3rd), he took his son's photo to the New Market photo shop to enlarge it because he missed his son so much. However, he was followed by bandits on Hengchangshou Road, who immediately committed murder by shooting him. Two shots were fired, one in the back and one through the breast, causing him to bleed profusely. After the incident, the police station strictly ordered the arrest of the murderer, and the court examined the body as usual.

They robbed her of two gold rings, a pair of gold bracelets, and a pair of gold earrings, all belonging to her daughter who had returned to Ningbo.

<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Embezzlement Case Occurs, Suspect Secretly Returns to Native Place: Yu Yucheng, a clerk of the county government, embezzled several hundred yuan by defrauding the purchase of 385 moth-luring lamps. On the 19th of last month, the county party headquarters invited representatives from various agencies and legal entities to the scene to testify and interrogate the three manufacturers, Yingdexing, Yuan Tianxing, and Zheng Youfu, who exposed the inside story and reported it to the county for severe punishment. It is learned that Yu secretly returned to his native place with his family on the 28th of the same month, and owes hundreds of yuan to five or six stores, including Juyunxiang Grocery Store and Tianhe Hardware Store. It is recently heard that Tianhe and other stores have opened a bill to the county government to claim the debt.</p>
<p>Rice Price Continues to Fall: Since the new rice in this county came on the market on the 22nd of last month, the price has gradually decreased. Due to the abundant harvest of early rice in various townships this year, and the abundant supply, the opening price on the second day has fallen from 12.5 yuan to 10 yuan, and the price is expected to continue to decline.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Linpu New Rice Market Price Drops Sharply: Linpu Town in Xiaoshan is a gathering place for rice shops. In the summer when the new rice was not available, the price of rice rose to 21 yuan per stone. Now that the new rice from Zhuji and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has been continuously transported here, the price of rice has dropped sharply. The new rice is 12 yuan per stone, and even the old rice is only sold for 15 yuan. According to rice merchants, the price of rice is expected to decrease further.</p>
<p>Northwest Two Ponds Urgently Need Repair: The Qianjiang River tide surged during the continuous rainstorms in Xiaoshan's Xijiang North Sea two ponds, causing the banks to collapse. It is reported that the Danyan Pantou Xinlin Zhouwai area is extremely dangerous, and the sand area on the west bank of Xixing was flooded, and the mud ponds on both banks were also collapsed. Because the autumn floods are approaching and the tides are about to rise, it is feared that they will be hit again. The local people have telegraphed the province to request urgent repairs to prevent future troubles.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter, by Haike</h3>
<p>A: This man claims to be a gentleman, so why is he speaking rudely and insulting me for no reason?</p>
<p>B: It's only because my front teeth fell out, and I haven't gotten them fixed, so when I talk, the air leaks out, and I don't even realize it myself.</p>
<p>A: You should wear a hat in the rain to avoid getting your head wet.</p>

<p>The Tragic Story of a Filial Daughter Who Died for Her Mother, Which Caused a Sensation in the Old Capital: Mr. Chen, a friend of Zhang Jing, has been working in the old capital for many years. Yesterday, he returned to his hometown and told me a recent tragic story of a filial daughter who died for her mother in the old capital, which was so sad, bizarre, and moving that I immediately wrote it down.</p>
<p>The filial daughter's surname was Wang, her name was Qinyu, and her style name was Meifeng. She was beautiful and loved literature. She lived in Beijing. She lost her mother in infancy and relied on her elder brother. Since the Sino-Eastern Railway Incident last year, her elder brother followed Brigadier Liang Zhongjia on an expedition against Russia. During the Battle of Manchuria, he died in battle. Her mother was heartbroken to hear the news, as she only had one son to rely on for the rest of her life. Upon hearing the tragic news, Qinyu mourned the journey, grieving all day and night, crying blood. Thinking that things had reached this point and that the dead could not be brought back to life, she thought, "Even if I mourn, it will not help the matter. It will only increase my mother's sorrow." So she forced herself to calm down and used sweet words to please her mother. From then on, life became more and more difficult. With the help of her uncle, Qinyu became a maid, working hard every day to support her mother. At the beginning of this month, her mother died. Qinyu was heartbroken and cried day and night by the tomb for ten days. The neighbors brought her food, but she did not eat. Instead, she lay by the tomb in the dim morning light and embroidered (Wang Qinyu was good at embroidery and had a good reputation in the old capital). On the morning of July 18th, she suddenly committed suicide in front of the tomb. When the neighbors heard about it and went to her, she was lying face up in a pool of blood, having gone to the underworld with her mother. In addition to finding a sharp blade in her neck, there were four quatrains of poetry dedicated to her mother next to her. The poems were so sad and moving that everyone who saw them could not help but weep. Now, Qinyu's master and local people plan to build a memorial to the filial daughter to commemorate her and promote filial piety.</p>

<h3>Eulogy for Old Friends Cheng Dihua and Xie Qianggong</h3>
<p>Discussing flowers and wine, reminiscing about the past, I, a half-ghost, only feel sad visiting old places. (Old friends from the news industry thirty years ago, such as Wu Jianren, Zhou Bingyuan, Gao Taichi, and Li Boyuan, have all passed away.) Rather than falling from the parapet in the arena, he preferred to try throwing dice from the window. The untimely death of her son-in-law was so tragic. As an official and an artisan, he was suited to the world. Having written a eulogy, I remember his advice, leaving me alone and forlorn.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that his silence would end in bloodshed? What does it matter if he dies a different kind of red? A misstep on half a staircase is an eternal regret, a glance back at the two empty floors. It's like a kite whose string has been cut, like ice melting into mismatched tiles. He never boarded a plane to fall from the sky, yet in the Nine Heavens, he still feels infinite regret.</p>
<p>Old friends have scattered like stars, talking about Lord Chunshen. Now, another friend has passed away. Did he jump from a building, as history suggests? Did he die in a fall, like the beautiful Green Pearl? The yellow banana trees dream in vain of fluttering butterflies, the Tang trees wither without blooming, turning into a grove of trees. In the fifth month, the flowers fall by themselves in Jiangcheng. The hippopotamus in the river shares my grief.</p>
<p>Working for years, collating and proofreading, thousands of pages of paper. With mistakes to be corrected, they provided food and drink. Recruiting Jie to return to Cao required careful consideration. He also received the title of King, a pitiful drink that led to his death. Patting the coffin, the widow is saddened, though tears are shed in vain.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Calligraphy and Painting Society is like a group, the old Question Inscription Hall is closed and the Tingyun is a discord.</p>
<p>The Calligraphy and Painting Society now called the Wan Mi Shanh Fang is promoting elegance through dust-stained writing and paintings. Yicheng is the newest organization, Qian Zihua Buddha is inviting me to tour his house on Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road into the building and sitting down is clean and elegant. Table, cases, vase and cup are position appropriate it is easily to chat or have a short break. It is not easy to find such a good place in the world. The walls are covered with paintings and calligraphy, such as Pei Heng's landscapes, which are well-known in northern Hebei, and Wang Taomin's ink paintings of wutong trees, with sparse leaves and autumn flavor. Liu Haisu's radishes are painted with a few strokes, showing that he can win with few. Zihua's Buddha makes people feel the Bodhi in their heart when they look at him. Meng Shubei's landscape is known for its simplicity and thickness. The strangest one is a painting that doesn't sign the author's name, a candelabra under a pile of skulls, a tumbler leaning against a cliff, watching indifferently, as if very proud, which is a world-weary pen. Other such as Yu Tiansui, Yang Liaogong Mr.'s hand writing that the poems is still worth the prize. The public wrote himself a poem with a line on the end saying that the poem did not know how much blood and tears, its grumbling all disclosed in the between twenty eight words regret. Zihua is the initiator of Yi Cheng and is hopeful with a long term plan to have rotating personal work exhibition in order to research and be in touch with calligraphy and painters for circulation. Anyone whom joins the association don't need membership fees, as well as set up an art of the boat mounted and beautiful preparations are made so it seems to for our country calligraphy and paint.</p>
<h3>Suzhou in the Extreme Heat, by Sun Choucheng</h3>
<p>Suzhou has been experiencing extremely hot weather recently, with the thermometer rising to over ninety-six degrees. Here are some of the things I have seen and heard to fill up the Free Talk. A Mud Plasterer Faints. For the sake of convenient transportation, the Wu County Government has decided to widen Guanqian Street and ordered all the houses along the street to be moved back within a time limit. If they are not moved back by the deadline, they will be forcibly demolished. The deadline has now arrived, so eight or nine out of ten houses on Guanqian Street are being demolished. With the blazing sun overhead, the mud plasterers who are working at heights are sweating profusely. As a result, people are fainting every day, keeping the water carriers busy. The water in the Suzhou city river is unclean, so the Sanitation Department has ordered all teahouses and Tiger Kilns to hire water carriers to fetch water from outside the city. To prevent them from cheating, the Sanitation Department has also ordered all water carriers to wear blue uniforms with the words "Water Carrier for [Teahouse Name]" written on them for inspection. Recently, with the hot weather, there is an even greater demand for water, so the water carriers are constantly traveling back and forth inside and outside the city.</p>
<p>Ice Factories are Thriving Threefold. There are not many ice factories in Suzhou, and their output is limited. In ordinary times, they can barely meet the demand. However, with the extreme heat, they cannot meet the demand. This is because the number of cold food stores has suddenly increased, and they use a lot of ice. In addition, with the hot weather, families are afraid that corpses will decompose, so they are buying ice to place next to the corpses. Therefore, the sales of ice have greatly expanded this year, and those who are in this business are increasing prices and thriving threefold.</p>
<p>Restaurants are Complaining Bitterly. With the extremely hot weather recently, epidemics are spreading. The Sanitation Department and doctors all believe that illnesses enter through the mouth, so people should be careful about what they eat and should not eat too much greasy or meaty food. In addition, with the scorching sun overhead, people are reluctant to walk around. Unless they have something important to do, they all stay indoors. The restaurants in Jin and Chang are not being patronized, causing the restaurants that have been open for decades to...</p>
<h3>Eastern Travel: Impressions (2) (10) (3)</h3>
<p>(10) (7) The Problem of Unfair Judging</p>
<p>In this Far Eastern Games, our nation suffered a complete defeat. People in the sports world used to boast that our nation excelled in cooperative sports but was weak in individual performances. Therefore, we often won in various ball games but consistently lost in track and field. However, after this tournament, such self-deceiving rhetoric to cover up shame has been thoroughly shattered. The supposedly undefeated football team even drew with Japan, a team known for its backwardness. While unfair judging had some impact, the strength and toughness of the Japanese team were undeniable. The reporter witnessed the final match; considering the skills displayed that day, it would not have been easy for China to defeat Japan. The Japanese football team has achieved its current level through five or six years of painstaking training. In other sports, like basketball, we lost all four matches. Volleyball was somewhat better, but frankly, our victory over the Philippines was largely due to luck. It is anticipated that with another four years of scientific training, Japan and the Philippines will make even more significant progress. In the next games, will our nation have any hope of winning championships? Victory or defeat is not about national honor, but for the sake of the entire future of Chinese sports, all levels of our government and society should unite and strive to reverse the decline. As for the problem of unfair judging, all three nations have had disputes in past tournaments, but this year was particularly egregious. The Japanese, seeking a temporary victory, sacrificed the integrity of their judges, leaving a significant stain. Their foolishness is beyond comprehension. During the matches, Chinese expatriate cheering squads, incensed by the unreasonable officiating, were ready to strike. Zhang Zhijiang, the director of the National Sports Institute, after watching the China-Japan volleyball match, repeatedly told friends how outrageous the Japanese were acting. Huaqiao Lin Zhuguang traveled from Singapore to watch the games, but during the China-Japan football match, he walked out in anger and took the train back to Singapore that night, saying he didn't want to endure pointless humiliation. Under such circumstances, not a single official from the Chinese Athletic Association negotiated with the other side, adopting an attitude of appeasement, allowing the Japanese to act recklessly. The fault for the China-Japan football dispute lies entirely with the Japanese referee. He had no authority to change the rules of football by not extending the match when it ended in a tie. Our nation should have justly and reasonably negotiated, refusing to concede. We should have considered it a forfeit by the Japanese, or at the very least, demanded a formal apology from the referee before replaying the match. Instead, only the trophy was kept, and all other issues were left unaddressed, creating a joke unprecedented in sports history. The next day, Dr. Zhang Boling, the head of our delegation, upon hearing the news, strongly advocated for a rematch, but was ultimately defeated by the majority opinion, effectively canceling it. Therefore, the responsibility for the football failure rests entirely with the Athletic Association. The Philippines, on the other hand, behaved differently. They immediately protested any unfair judgment with an extremely strong attitude. For example, in the final decisive basketball match, the Filipino captain was the first to be ejected. The referee constantly favored the Japanese. The Philippines endured it in the first half, but radically changed tactics in the second half, constantly and fiercely questioning the referee, implying that they would rather withdraw than continue the game. In addition, Chinese spectators cheered them on, with one person in the cheering squad saying that if the Filipino players used force, we would all join in and beat the Japanese to a pulp to vent our pent-up anger. Seeing the hostile atmosphere, the referee's attitude suddenly softened and he hesitated to penalize them easily. Even when the Filipino team truly committed fouls, he simply called for a jump ball. As a result, the Filipino team's momentum surged, and they seized the championship in the final moment. The Japanese were outsmarted, which is often the case. After the match, just as the Filipino national anthem was being sung, the Filipino captain jumped out from the crowd and shouted "Long live the referee!", displaying extreme sarcasm, which could also be considered a prank. Unexpectedly, on the last day, the Filipino team withdrew from the boxing competition. According to the Filipino team members, they would also try to seek revenge in judging when the next games are held in Manila. This statement truly represents the sentiments of some Filipinos. Therefore, resolving the judging issue is a pressing matter for the sports community of all three countries. The reporter had several discussions with Dr. Zhang Boling in Japan on this matter and believes that the most appropriate solution is to organize a trilateral referee committee to train referees. At the same time, when two countries compete, referees from the third country should be invited to officiate, so that there is no room for dispute. Otherwise, conflicts will be endless and may shake the foundation of the games. Later, when Mr. Zhang proposed this to the representatives of the three countries at a meeting, it was only agreed that when a country hosts the games, the referees it hires should be subject to the approval of the other countries. However, this is still not a fundamental solution. It is hoped that the members of the Athletic Association will pay special attention to this issue and study ways to remedy it in detail, submitting proposals to the games to prevent any further disputes over judging. This is also the responsibility of the gentlemen of the Athletic Association.</p>
<p>Yichangfu can no longer maintain business and has ceased operations, and other restaurants such as Yanyue Lou are also complaining bitterly.</p>
<p>Parks are crowded with visitors. After the abandoned royal foundation in the city was converted into a park, two teahouses were set up on the east and west sides of the library, called East Studio and West Pavilion. Recently, due to the large crowds of visitors, tall sunshades have been erected and additional seating has been added to accommodate guests. In the evening, men and women often stroll together, competing for space to cool off. The open-air chairs placed near the fountain are especially popular. Other places such as pavilions, under large trees, and near the lotus pond are filled with people sitting on the ground, whispering sweet nothings, which is a common sight.</p>
<h3>A Record of Gecko Wine from Wuzhou by Lü Bing</h3>
<p>My friend Mr. Chen, who serves in the military, recently came to Beijing from Guangdong with his unit and was passing through on his way north. When we met, he presented me with a bottle, which I knew contained alcohol, but with an animal submerged inside. I laughed and said, "I am not a biologist, what would I do with this specimen?" Mr. Chen said, "You are fond of a drink, so I brought this wine from afar as a gift, as it is a specialty product: Gecko Wine from Wuzhou." I then looked closely and saw that the wine had a deep blue-green color, and the animal inside was about five inches long, with all four limbs intact, and a particularly long tail. It looked very similar to the geckos I usually see, except that its head was larger. This must be what the people of Wuzhou call a gecko. According to Mr. Chen, every spring and summer, winemakers in Wuzhou collect these animals, remove their venom, and clean them before using them to soak in wine. The taste is quite good, and it can invigorate the blood and ward off miasma. Therefore, those serving in Guangdong often buy it for themselves, and friends share it together. Some even have people bring it from afar just to have a taste. This shows the value of the wine. I thought that the people of Guangdong are fond of novel cuisine, and that snakes and cats are all delicacies on the menu for them to feast on, so geckos soaked in wine are even less surprising. However, every time I raise the bottle to pour, I think about trying the fine wine from Wuzhou, but my courage fails me because of the large gecko inside. So, for now, I still keep it on the shelf as a kind of specimen. This can also be said to be the misfortune of the wine.</p>

<h3>The Course of the Financial Standard Silver's Wild Rise and Fall</h3>
<p>India's ban on the import of raw silver triggered short covering. The spot market's stagnant trend added five or six taels to the standard silver price. Last week, the standard silver price rose sharply again, reaching over thirty taels at one point. However, the tumultuous waves, rising and falling daily, were unstoppable. There were rises and falls of more than ten taels, due to the confusion and panic among the industry players, who lacked a clear direction. From the beginning to the end of the week, there was a total swing of forty-three taels. Initially, there were rumors that the banks were releasing U.S.-Japan exchange. As a result, major players were inclined to sell, abruptly breaking through the fifty-tael mark, plummeting to forty-five taels and one qian, greatly diminishing the bullish momentum. Later, the silver market trended lower, and the exchange rate rebounded slightly. By Saturday, it had surged to eighty-eight taels as major players chased gains. However, sellers such as Chengfeng, Yongfu, Changheng, and Xingheng rushed to sell, causing it to slump back to the eighty-tael mark. Compared to the previous weekend, it had rebounded by twenty-three taels and six qian. The day's exchange rate showed a huge contraction of eighty-eight to eighty-nine qian since the beginning of the week, then it subsided to sixty-two or sixty-three taels by the end of the week, although this was still a substantial amount. The stagnant trend in the spot market also made prices unremarkable, adding about five or six taels to the standard silver price. The general situation of the past six days, from Monday (July 28) to the weekend (August 2), is described below.</p>
<p>The weekend saw an increase of twenty-three taels and six qian compared to Monday. The British and American silver markets continued to rise, and exchange rates also increased slightly, but the internal situation was chaotic and unstable, firm in the morning and loose in the evening. The initial opening price for September standard silver was 560 taels, an increase of three taels compared to the previous weekend, due to the unchanged U.S.-Japan exchange rate. Soon after, sellers showed their strength and pushed the price down by eight or nine taels. At midday, it turned flat at sixty taels. In the afternoon, the Indian exchange rate rose, and rumors spread that Mitsui had released U.S. dollars, causing panic and a sudden plunge below the fifty-tael mark, reaching forty-five taels and one qian. Suddenly, the Indian exchange rate rebounded, and there were rumors that India had banned the import of raw silver, causing short sellers to panic and rush to cover their positions. Seeing the potential for a reversal, they suddenly surged upward by more than nineteen taels, and the market changed from weak to bullish. They soon reached sixty-four and a half taels, closing at sixty-three taels. The next day, the exchange rate declined slightly. The pound sterling remained unchanged, and the domestic market was tight, but the gold price had already exceeded seventy taels. Throughout the day, there were fluctuations of twelve or thirteen taels. On Wednesday, the silver market continued to contract, and exchange rates were reduced slightly, but the gold market rose sharply and smoothly. Major players, such as Taikang, Runfu, Yu, and Mr. Hu (speculator) bravely advanced, pushing the price out of the eighty-tael mark. In the afternoon, it reached eighty-three taels, with fluctuations of eleven taels. The next day, the silver market shrank slightly and market sentiment remained soft, and the exchange rate was also reduced slightly, but the internal trend reversed. Thus, standard silver almost rebounded. Throughout the day, the market was turbulent, with a difference of thirteen and a half taels. The previous market had fallen ten taels, and the subsequent market had reached sixty-six and a half taels. Later, Hengxing, Yongfeng, and others bought, pushing it back above the seventy-tael mark. On Friday, the silver market remained unchanged, the American silver price rose slightly, and the pound sterling remained as before. There was some buying in the domestic market, and the standard silver price suddenly reached a peak. Since the early market was flat with slight fluctuations, followed by Yongheng, Taikang, Runxiangyu and others selling, it once fell to 70 taels, and the lowest price was 67 taels and 7 qian. After that, it gradually rose by five or six taels. In the later market, due to the U.S.-Japan exchange rate being reported as large, the Japanese telecommunications agency said that the current period had actually reached 49.625 yuan. The news spread, and the market suddenly broke through the 80-tael mark, reaching 84 taels and 8 qian. As a result, it fell back by two taels. On this day, there were seventeen taels of difference. On Saturday (August 2), the market became nearly circular. In half a day, there were nine taels of fluctuations. The opening price in the morning was 80 taels and 6 qian, which was two taels lower. The big bank rate was unchanged, and the silver price shrank, but the U.S.-Japan exchange rate did not move, so the market sentiment softened. Then, it retreated to the 80-tael mark, reaching 79 taels. After that, the upward trend rose again, but there were three or four taels of rise and fall from time to time, once reaching 88 taels. Until noon, the selling was turbulent, and it had now subsided by seven or eight taels. The closing price was 80 taels and 6 qian, a decrease of two taels and one qian from the day before. Compared with the previous weekend, it increased by twenty-three taels and six qian. In a week, there was a total swing of forty-two taels and nine qian. The confusion and uncertainty of the market situation make it difficult to predict. A list of the high and low prices of the British, American, and Indian silver markets, exchange rates, and standard silver is shown below:</p>
<p>| Type       | Highest       | Lowest        | Compared to last Saturday |</p>

<p>| Standard Silver | 588 taels | 545 taels 1 qian | Increase 23 taels 6 qian |</p>
<h3>The British and American Silver Prices Continued to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's London telegrams indicated that the big bank rate continued to decline, with the near-term rate breaking through the 16 pence mark, down 125 to 15 pence 9375 (combined with a British gold increase of 1 shilling 6 pence 875). The far-term rate also fell 125 to 15 pence 8125. A New York telegram also reported that the U.S. silver price fell 125 to 3.425, while the British-American exchange rate fell 0625 to 4.871875 yuan. The British-British exchange rate remained unchanged at 2 shillings 0375, and the Japanese-American exchange rate remained at 49.375 yuan. The U.S. dollar exchange rate fell 03125 to 4.871875 yuan. The British-Shanghai exchange rate fell 25 to 1 shilling 6 pence 5625.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Rose Slightly, but Silver Loans Were Still Available</h3>
<p>Yesterday, as usual, the financial market was generally calm on Sunday. The foreign currency price was slightly brisk, with the morning market at 7 qian 2 fen 8 li 8 hao 7 hu and the afternoon market at 7 qian 2 fen 8 li 6 hao 2 hu, resulting in a slight increase of 1 hao 2 hu compared to the previous day. The silver loan was 2 fen in the morning market and borrowed for nothing in the afternoon market, the same as the previous day's morning and afternoon markets. The transaction of foreign currency was 370,000 yuan in the morning and 263,000 yuan in the afternoon. The amount of paper money was only 27,000 yuan in the afternoon. The morning market of Zhongshan new currency was 21,000 yuan and there was no transaction in the afternoon. The off-market paper money was 55,000 yuan in the morning and 40,000 yuan in the afternoon. Due to the holiday, there was no news from the banks regarding various transactions and settlements. The money shops settled more than 3.2 million yuan of foreign currency, and there was no news regarding the head accounts. The silver shops settled more than 29 million yuan, and the settlement of interbank remittances was more than 400,000 yuan. The amount of new currency shipped to other places was more than 200,000 yuan. The transaction of small money shops was 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. The price of Jiangnan small foreign coins has been rising sharply recently, and yesterday it rose again by 5 or 6 li, with the morning market at 6 qian 4 fen 8 li and the afternoon market at 6 qian 4 fen 5 li. The transaction was 9,000 jiao in the morning market and 3,500 jiao in the afternoon market. Foreign firms bought more than 10,000 jiao. The price of Guangdong small foreign coins was 6 qian 1 fen 3 li 8 hao 7 hu in the morning market and 6 qian 1 fen 4 li 2 hao in the afternoon market. The transaction was 160,000 jiao in the morning market and 100,500 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins decreased by 2,000 wen to 390,000 wen.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Prices Fell Unanimously Last Week</h3>
<p>The situation of various government bonds in the local securities market last week was far inferior to the previous period. The atmosphere in the market throughout the week was very cold, and buying and selling were quiet from beginning to end. Such a calm situation was rarely seen recently. Because the bond market environment was deteriorating before and after the settlement, all parties waited and watched, and neither the bulls nor the bears dared to do much. Except for Wednesday when the market was closed for settlement, Monday was the quietest, with only 1.76 million yuan in transactions. Thursday was slightly better, with approximately 6.8 million yuan. Other days were only in the range of 4 to 5 million yuan. The total transaction volume for the week was only 23,335,000 yuan, a decrease of more than 17 million yuan compared to the previous week. The breakdown was: 4,385,000 yuan for August Customs bonds, 1,650,000 yuan for September bonds, 4,600,005 yuan for August Disbandment bonds, 1,500,000 yuan for September bonds, 3,010,000 yuan for August Troop Reduction bonds, 1,740,000 yuan for September bonds, 2,400,005 yuan for August Reorganization bonds, 1,570,000 yuan for September bonds, 1,065,000 yuan for August Consolidation 6% bonds, 165,000 yuan for September bonds, 715,000 yuan for August Continued Bonds, 135,000 yuan for September bonds. Other categories were even more scarce, such as 96 bonds with 90,000 yuan, continued 25 bonds with only 290,000 yuan in August, and financial bonds with only 5,000 yuan each. Spot transactions were still rare, with only 52,000 yuan transacted throughout the week. Although there were no major changes in the price of various bonds during the week, the unfavorable situation and the deteriorating bond market environment made people uneasy. As a result, although the selling price of various bonds had fallen quite low, sellers were not eager to sell, and buyers were even more likely to wait and watch. Except for a few small investors, most large investors waited and did not move. Therefore, the market situation appeared to favor the sellers. Except for a slight rebound on the last day of the weekend, the rest of the days mostly hovered and declined, with few turning points. As a result, the price of Troop Reduction bonds had fallen by more than 4 yuan compared to the previous week, making it the largest decline. Other bonds also fell by about 1 to 2 yuan each. Only the 96 bonds, Standing Bonds and Continued Bonds, rebounded by 1.3 yuan in August. The following table lists the statistics of the high, low, rise and fall of various bond prices in the past week (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>| Bond Type | Period | Spot | Highest | Lowest | Difference | Rise/Fall |</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Was Active Last Week</h3>
<p>The price increased by two or three taels. The current sales were smooth, and the market price was also one or two taels higher. The yarn market, which had been held back for a long time, suddenly rose last week, mainly due to the demand for yarn. Firstly, the decline in overseas yarn had subsided, and people's confidence had turned firm. Secondly, the autumn season was approaching, and Cantonese merchants were eagerly searching for yarn for immediate and future delivery. After the majority absorbed 10-count coarse yarn, merchants from Xuzhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan followed suit. As a result, the spot yarn market became tighter and the market sentiment was stirred up. Cantonese merchants, seeing a good environment, strengthened their pulling power. However, according to some, most of the spot yarn bought by Cantonese merchants was transferred to warehouses with a deposit and had not been completely shipped out. However, the strength of the Cantonese merchants was strong, and they also purchased standard yarn at the same time. Short sellers, seeing the smooth actual sales and the strong trend, had to cover their positions, which further strengthened the market sentiment. The market was very tight, and the large short seller Dafeng had already covered all their positions. However, Ruida and Japanese merchants still had 40,000 to 50,000 short positions and remained unmoved. Thousands of bales of long-term Japanese yarn were dragged in from outside. Statistics showed that all the merchants bought a total of 13,815 bales of spot yarn throughout the week, and merchants within the industry bought 3,650 bales. The price rose by one or two taels. Buyers of standard yarn were optimistic about the potential for a bumper harvest this year and tended to go long, so the market tightened. The price of each month's yarn was two or three taels higher than the previous week. A total of 88,150 bales were traded throughout the week, and the price of Grade 3 yarn rose by 456 yuan. The amount bought by each merchant group is recorded below:</p>
<p>| Merchant Group | Bale Amount | Merchant Group | Bale Amount | Merchant Group | Bale Amount |</p>
<p>| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |</p>
<p>| Inland       | 800           | Guangdong       | 3,340         | Changsha       | 780           |</p>

<h3>The Cotton Market Remained Extremely Ordinary Last Week</h3>
<p>The current supply from cotton mills was only 5,484 dan.</p>
<p>The overall situation in the cotton market remained flat and weak, with U.S. cotton consumption decreasing and the new cotton production progressing smoothly. However, there was a drought in the South, so the price fluctuated around 1.03 yuan. However, the rolling inventory was more than 1 million bales larger than last year, so the overall situation remained weak. Most factories in Shanghai had absorbed enough Indian cotton and had no business in local cotton. In previous years, factories would eagerly purchase cotton before the new cotton season, but this year very few inquired, indicating that the factories had sufficient stockpiles. Japanese factories were able to supply cotton until the end of the year, so the target of some manufacturers was that the price of U.S. cotton should reach 32 or 33 taels if the weather remained calm and good. However, the weather in the future is difficult to predict, and the attitude of buyers is strong and the pulling power is very high, and they are always unwilling to relax, so the situation is very tough. Currently, according to the villagers, the production situation is exceptionally good. The price of standard cotton for each month rose by 0.023 yuan compared to the previous week. The total transaction volume for the week was 180,500 dan. The transaction of spot cotton by various factories was dull and there was no interest. Various factories purchased a total of 5,484 dan of spot and futures. Haojia purchased 1,200 dan of Yao cotton. After investigating the Indian cotton purchased by various factories, there was still a large batch arriving. The cotton market was completely suppressed by Indian cotton, and the number of Indian yarn factories that were closing down was increasing every day. The surplus of raw cotton was even greater, so the situation in the world cotton market was weak. Fortunately, the base cargo of local cotton was thinner than in previous years, and merchants from Hankou were not trying to sell off their inventory with all their might, so the market could remain stable. The price of U.S. cotton fell by 10 pounds compared to the previous week. The amount purchased by each manufacturer and firm is listed below:</p>
<p>| Manufacturer | Purchased at Highest Price | Purchased at Lowest Price | Transaction Volume | Delivery Period | Remarks |</p>
<p>| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |</p>
<p>| New Shaanxi Cotton | 35.25 | ... | 1,000 pieces | November-December | Delivery to Factory |</p>
<p>| Shaanxi Cotton | 36.00 | 35.15 | 385 pieces | Spot | Again |</p>
<p>| Taicang Cotton | 36.00 | ... | 100 bales | Again: Trading House |</p>
<p>| Yao Cotton | 33.06 | 33.20 | 1,000 bales | Storage Transfer |</p>
<h3>Grain: The Riverfront Rice Market Steps Up in Price</h3>
<p>At Zhabei yesterday, the number of boats arriving from inland areas was noticeably scarce. Sales in various shops were brisk, and freshly arrived Northern Japonica rice saw a price increase of about two jiao. Currently, the average wholesale price hovers around the 21-yuan mark. Fortunately, there is no stock of special top-grade Japonica rice. Aged white Japonica rice increased in price by one jiao and a half. The mid-grade supply is relatively sufficient. This recent price increase is due to the firming of foreign rice prices and the sudden rise in Japonica rice prices in Changzhou and Wuxi in the interior, coupled with slightly depleted inventories in various quarters of this street. This prompted competitive buying, and with fewer goods arriving in Shanghai due to some merchants adopting a wait-and-see attitude, the market turned upward. Consequently, the footing of the Japonica rice market has become solid. Fresh Dongxin Japonica rice is still not popular, opening high at 20 yuan, with a stable market. There are virtually no high-priced early rice varieties on the market. Mid-grade goods manage some transactions, with prices very tight. The trend continues to improve compared to the previous day, with top-grade rice also seeing an increase of slightly over one jiao. Common varieties remain unchanged, with both arrivals and sales being sluggish. Wholesale prices are high at 18.5 yuan, and this type of rice shows no signs of improvement.  In the Shanghai South riverfront area, incoming supplies continue to be scarce, with sales focusing on choice goods. Top-grade Changzhou-Wuxi Japonica rice is scarce, and regular varieties are also limited. Retailers are doing well, and prices are tight, varying by one or two jiao. The demand for Su-Tong machine-milled rice is not weak, with very active retail sales, and prices have also increased by about one jiao. New Cambodian Japonica rice is not very popular, with prices also opening at 20 yuan, and the market situation is firm and stable. Although the market for Southern early rice is tight, importers are picky, mostly selecting high-quality and rejecting lower-quality rice. As a result, the market saw significant price fluctuations throughout the day. Top-grade rice saw a slight increase, while mid-grade and ordinary rice remained unchanged. Arrivals of Yangjian rice are meager, and what arrives is not high-grade. As a result, the market is stagnant, with conditions stable. Only particularly high-quality goods are tight. Large transactions are sluggish, resembling goods that are out of season. Therefore, market conditions remain mediocre.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Sales Rise Last Week</h3>
<p>French firms have already been buying... Speculative silk sales to the US have also been active, but regrettably the base price for Japanese silk is too low... and telegraphic transfers for silk are not high.  Last week, the local foreign firm silk market gradually became active. In the first half of the week, French firms continued to buy spot silk, but due to price limitations, transactions were difficult to conclude. In the second half of the week, speculative silk sales to the US gradually became active. American firms received inquiries from New York and other places, as New York silk mills are receiving many orders daily and have been starting work since Monday. While existing spot silk inventories are substantial, the amount of speculative sales is limited, so they are preparing to buy speculative goods for October, November, and December. Because the base price for Japanese silk is too low, the cost of silk coming from overseas is not enough to discuss business, and it remains difficult to reach an agreement. Transactions are pending. Last week, a total of three or four hundred bales of yellow and white factory silk were transacted. Sales of coarse silk for printing have also risen, with two or three hundred bales of Sichuan, Hubei, and Zhejiang yellow and white native silk being transacted. Silk prices have shown an upward trend. Due to the increased freight costs starting August 1st, European firms are actively shipping silk, estimated at over one thousand bales, to Europe and America. Overseas Chinese silk prices have already turned firm and risen. The following is a list of Chinese silk market prices in the European and American markets at the end of last week (unit: US dollars per pound in New York, francs in Lyon):</p>
<p>Silk Type     New York   Lyon   Silk Type     New York   Lyon</p>
<p>High-Grade Shanghai Spun   4.38     322   High-Grade Dried Spun   2.55     191</p>

<p>Advocating Thrift and Rejecting Extravagance</p>
<p>The County Government's Proclamation</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government issued a proclamation yesterday, stating: "Regarding Instruction No. 1079 from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, which contained Instruction No. Shang Zi 11376 from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce regarding the implementation of the following matter: 'It is reported that the Shanghai Special Municipality Merchant Group Reorganization Committee has submitted a proposal with four measures to remedy the extraordinary rise in gold prices: (1) Actively promote domestic goods; (2) Revise export tariffs; (3) Restrict speculative trading and purchase of drafts by non-import merchants; (4) Import businesses should settle prices promptly. We request consideration and implementation.' Based on this, considering that the extraordinary rise in gold prices has greatly affected the livelihood of merchants and the people, the proposed remedial measures submitted by the committee are not without merit. Except for the second item, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance and is subject to the Ministry of Finance's approval, the third and fourth items have been separately considered and adopted. Regarding the promotion of domestic goods, this Ministry has repeatedly sent instructions to various provincial and municipal governments to notify their respective jurisdictions to inform officials and civilians to purchase domestic goods without exception. Currently, with gold being expensive and silver being cheap, the import prices of foreign goods will inevitably increase. Domestic products should seize the opportunity to vigorously promote their use. All Chinese people should especially reject extravagance and advocate thrift. Imported luxury goods should be firmly rejected. Even for daily necessities for which there are currently no suitable domestic substitutes, strict economy should be practiced to reduce outflows. Furthermore, it is hoped that manufacturers will understand that people tend to favor cheaper goods and avoid expensive ones. Manufacturers must ensure that prices are fair and must not take the opportunity to raise prices. On the other hand, they should carefully study and strive to improve the quality of their products. Then, the Chinese people will naturally be happy to use domestic goods, and there will be some balance in import trade. The development of the national economy depends on this. In addition to issuing separate orders, we hereby order the said Department to instruct its subordinates to issue a clear proclamation to inform merchants and civilians to be aware of this matter and act accordingly. This order is of utmost importance.' Upon receiving this, in addition to issuing separate orders, we hereby order the said County Magistrate to diligently implement and clearly inform the public, without fail. Upon receiving this, in addition to instructing various districts to comply, we hereby issue a proclamation to inform the people to be aware of this matter. It should be known that purchasing domestic goods will prevent the outflow of rights and interests. All patriotic citizens must actively promote thrift and reject extravagance. All should comply without fail. This proclamation is hereby issued."</p>
<p>○ Question of Deed Tax After the Division of the Municipality and County The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance states that it should be a provincial tax.</p>
<p>There will be a joint reconciliation soon.</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance stopped subsidizing the public security expenses of Shanghai and Baoshan counties last year, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance instructed the heads of the Shanghai and Baoshan County Bureaus of Finance to reconcile accounts with the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance. It is now learned that the heads of the two County Bureaus of Finance reconciled with the Municipal Bureau of Finance on the 27th of last month. However, regarding the tax revenue, the Municipal Bureau of Finance believes that the tax on the busy season and the tax on Caohe (transportation of grain) should be remitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, while the deed tax should belong to the Municipal Bureau of Finance. Therefore, no reconciliation was possible at that time. County Finance Bureau Chief Wang of Shanghai sent a telegram to the Provincial Department of Finance requesting instructions. Yesterday, a reply was received from the province stating that the deed tax should still be remitted to the province along with the tax on the busy season and the tax on Caohe for verification. It is reported that the heads of the two County Bureaus of Finance have informed the Municipal Bureau of Finance to act accordingly and will schedule another reconciliation soon.</p>
<h3>Black Cixiid Insects, Pests in the Fields of Wusong, Gradually Disappearing</h3>
<p>Most Have Been Blown Away by the Typhoon</p>
<p>A Small Number of Remaining Insects Are Deeply Hidden in the Rice Roots</p>
<p>Farmers Are Using Ducks to Catch Them</p>
<p>The previous report mentioned that a large number of black cixiids had been discovered in the fields around Wusong, damaging the rice crops. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs immediately instructed the Wusong Municipal Committee to instruct farmers in the area to catch the insects according to prevention and control methods in order to prevent rice damage and issued 100 yuan to purchase rice stem borer eggs, etc. After receiving the order, Municipal Committee member Tang Chengzong immediately sent personnel to the four villages to vigorously promote and encourage farmers to prevent and control the insects according to the law and to catch them in time to prevent them from spreading. It is now learned that most of the harmful rice insects have been blown away by the continuous typhoons, so they have not been found in the fields. However, a small number of remaining insects are still deeply hidden in the rice roots, and it is feared that they will cause harm in the future. If manual searching and catching are used, it will be quite difficult and may damage the rice stalks. According to the prevention and control methods, ducks can be used to release them into the fields, where they will suck and eat the insect pests along with the rice. Not only will the insect pests be eliminated, but the rice stalks will not be damaged, and 50-60% of farming families raise ducks. If this is promoted, it will be quite effective. Therefore, the committee member sent personnel to the countryside yesterday to instruct farmers to release all the ducks they have raised into the fields and let them forage freely, so that the insect pests can be eliminated without being caught.</p>
<h3>Late Payment Penalties for the Busy Season and Caohe</h3>
<p>Restoring the Pre-Republic Year 5 Method</p>
<p>Proclamation by the Baoshan County Bureau of Finance</p>
<p>The Baoshan County Bureau of Finance issued a proclamation yesterday, stating: "Regarding the issuance of a proclamation, in the case of Instruction No. 161 from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, it is noted that this Department submitted a request to restore the penalty for late payment of the busy season and Caohe taxes to the method used before the fifth year of the Republic, where a penalty of one-tenth would be added after two months of collection. The request has been approved by the 315th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee and should be implemented. In addition to issuing separate orders, we are urgently copying the original submission and summary rules to instruct the said Bureau to comply, issue a proclamation, and implement the matter starting from the busy season of the 19th year of the Republic and report back for verification without fail. This order, etc., and a copy of the original submission and summary rules were received by the Bureau. Upon receiving this, in addition to submitting a report to the County Government and issuing separate letters to relevant agencies for compliance, we hereby issue a proclamation for this purpose. We hereby notify all grain households in the county to be aware of this matter. It has been announced that the cabinet for collecting the upper tax on the busy season of this year was opened on July 11. All grain households are requested to enthusiastically clear their accounts within the two-month limit without delay. Once the deadline has passed and payment has not been made, we will immediately issue summons to recover the arrears. All should comply without fail. This proclamation is hereby issued. Director: Bei Jietai."</p>
<h3>Continuing Efforts to Promote the National Calendar</h3>
<p>The County Propaganda Department Orders All Districts to Comply</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Party Reorganization Committee Propaganda Department issued a notice to all districts, stating: "Regarding the compliance matter, Instruction No. 147 from the Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee Propaganda Department contains Instruction No. 9933 from the Central Executive Committee, which states: 'Upon investigation of the general use of the National Calendar, considerable success has been achieved since the implementation of the two lines of supervision and encouragement. Continued efforts should be made to achieve complete success. The compilation of almanacs and the relocation of old calendar festivals have been jointly discussed and resolved by the Astronomy Institute of the National Central Research Institute, the Ministry of Education, and the Propaganda Department of this Committee. However, regarding the entire issue of promoting the National Calendar, such as the regulations for relocating various etiquette, decorations, and entertainment of the old calendar New Year to the National Calendar year, the prohibition of printing, selling, and using old calendar almanacs, the conversion of dates for local market towns, fairs, and temple festivals to the National Calendar, the measures for prohibiting stores from operating during the old calendar New Year, the conversion of farmers' cultivation periods to the National Calendar for calculation and guidance, and other matters related to the promotion of the National Calendar, should be promptly discussed in detail and properly regulated to ensure uniformity and facilitate progress. This Committee convened a meeting on May 27 with representatives from the Ministry of Interior, Education, Agriculture and Mining, Industry and Commerce, and the Astronomy Institute to promote the National Calendar, resulting in six resolutions that have been approved and are being implemented separately.' The previous communication was resolved by the 98th Standing Committee meeting of this Committee, which revised the resolutions into six measures for promoting the National Calendar and forwarded them to the Political Council for submission to the National Government. In addition to issuing separate letters and orders, we hereby attach a copy of the said measures for the said Party Department to diligently comply with and implement, and to forward them to its subordinates for compliance as well. This order is of utmost importance.' Upon receiving this, we should comply with the implementation. In addition to issuing separate orders, we are urgently copying the said measures for promoting the National Calendar for immediate compliance and to forward them to your subordinates for compliance as well. This order is of utmost importance.' Upon receiving this, in addition to issuing separate orders, we are urgently printing and distributing the said measures for promoting the National Calendar and instructing your subordinates to comply with and implement them diligently. This order is more important."</p>
<p>○ Xu Peikun's Views on the Gold Standard A reporter from the Continental News Agency interviewed economist Xu Peikun in the China University Commercial College in Shanghai to inquire about his views on the Ministry of Finance's promotion of the gold standard, the illusory gold standard, and the high price of gold and the cheap price of silver. He was very detailed in his statement of the truth. A special record of the following statement is made:</p>
<p>Mr. Xu said, "Since the outbreak of the financial turmoil in Shanghai, there have been various opinions, and it is difficult to reach a consensus. There are very few people who can formulate a relief plan according to scientific methods. The opinions recently expressed by Mr. Zhang Daqi and Mr. Yu Huancheng are profound and in line with economic principles, and they are not ordinary works. It is a pity that people either quote them out of context or reverse right and wrong, writing thousands of words at will, which can be regarded as beautiful articles, but they are far from the essence of economic science. Now, I have four points on the high price of gold, the cheap price of silver, and the standard: (1) Prohibition of gold exports and the prohibition of the import of Mexican silver dollars After the gold rush occurred, it took four or five months before the government resolutely decided to ban the export of cash and prohibit the import of Mexican silver dollars. However, Mexican silver dollars have long since ceased to be imported, so this ban is equivalent to a mere formality. If the import of Annam hard coins had been banned at that time, the effect of the previous ban would have been slightly better. Since last winter, the export of cash has become a massive trend, and it has become even more intense this spring. Most of the gold bars that were accumulated in large quantities have been purchased by foreign banks and shipped abroad. The government began to issue an order to ban it, so it is no wonder that the effect is minimal. A few people do not blame the government for not taking measures in time, but instead generally criticize the ineffectiveness of the cash export ban, which is truly ridiculous. Furthermore, after the implementation of this ban, rumors spread like wildfire, that Japan would protest, that the government would automatically abolish the ban, that foreign warships and merchants would privately transport cash for export, that certain speculators would collect exorbitant taxes on large drafts, and that all kinds of things would cause the Shanghai financial market to fall into chaos and changes would become more drastic. A few people did not observe and simply ignored all these important reasons, and said that the gold rush three weeks ago could be attributed to the cash export ban. I don't know if there was no such ban, the gold standard would have risen to seven or eight hundred taels, and the various exchange rates would have shrunk to a very low limit. The close relationship between the gold standard and the exchange rate has been discussed in detail in newspapers. Furthermore, the gold standard has fallen sharply in the past few months, mostly because the government found out that all privately transported gold bars were confiscated and confiscated, and the government also revised the amount of money that individuals could carry, which also shows the government's determination to crack down. Speculators knew that the general trend was set, so they sold short, and the gold standard fell sharply and the exchange rate fell accordingly. In short, if the government has the determination to rescue the high price of gold and the cheap price of silver, the ban on gold exports will definitely achieve considerable results. If the government's policies are inconsistent and there is no fixed policy, plus the various rumors spread on the market, then not only will the high price of gold and the cheap price of silver not be rescued, but the future of the national fortune will be extremely dangerous. (2) Levying taxes on silver and prohibiting gambling on the gold standard and foreign exchange Levying taxes on silver and prohibiting gambling on the gold standard are the most effective and appropriate relief methods. Rescuing foreign exchange is the sovereignty of a country. No matter what country sees a dangerous situation, it will immediately find a way to deal with it. Levying silver tax is the best way to rescue our country's silver exchange rate. If it had been implemented in April and May, the financial turmoil would not have expanded as it did. However, the government has not been able to implement it. How much I hope that the government officials will teach us. In addition, speculation in the financial market is an important transaction recognized by various countries, but excessive speculation is also called gambling, and there is no country that does not strictly prohibit it. However, our country ignores it as if it cannot maintain its life without gambling. In recent months, gambling on the gold standard and foreign exchange has been the main reason for disrupting the silver exchange rate, but there are very few people who understand this point, and the government also follows the trend and lets it go. This is another reason why the financial turmoil cannot be quelled. (3) Promoting domestic goods and resisting foreign goods The loss caused by the outbreak of the turmoil is indescribable. The closure of commercial institutions, the suicide of people due to economic pressure, the emptiness of the financial sector, and the loss of vitality in the economic sector are difficult to calculate. For the sake of mending the fold after the sheep has escaped, resisting foreign goods and promoting domestic goods are slow-acting medicines, but they are also urgent matters. However, Chinese people have a five-minute hotness for everything, so the losses suffered this time will never be made up. If the Chinese people can learn from the pain, at least everyone should promote domestic goods as their own responsibility. (4) The gold standard and the illusory gold standard The illusory gold standard or the gold exchange standard can achieve considerable results when implemented in affiliated countries, with the protecting country acting as an agent for everything. It is a loss of national dignity to adopt this standard in an independent country. This is a political issue and will not be discussed for the time being. From an economic standpoint, the establishment of this standard must have a huge amount of cash for adjustment. In our country, due to the strength of exports and speculation and the lack of financial management talents, we know that it is absolutely impossible to maintain the exchange rate parity in the future, and the rise and fall of the exchange rate in the future must become more and more drastic. Today's exchange rate is like the speed of a rickshaw or a carriage. After the implementation of the imaginary gold wooden position, its changes will be more rapid than a car or a train. There are many experiences in various countries, and those who have studied exchange rates can tell you about it. I (Xu himself) have repeatedly said that the gold standard is not applicable. Now I will add one or two more points. Although there are many countries currently adopting the gold standard, how many countries can truly maintain their gold standard? Those who advocate the gold standard should not investigate to see how many countries can benefit both the national economy and the people's livelihood. Those who are enthusiastic about the gold standard should not do a little more research. Furthermore, the world's gold production is limited, and the use of currency systems is gradually expanding. Economists in various countries have long paid attention to the drawbacks of the gold standard. Furthermore, the gold standard before and after the European War is the same in name but different in reality. The gold standard currently adopted by various countries has lost its true meaning. Economists have long had suggestions for reforming the currency system standard. In the future, countries will have no choice but to adopt a pluralistic standard or a gold and silver standard to resolve currency disputes. Our country's promotion of the gold standard today is a clear indication of China's backwardness in everything. It is no wonder that Counselor Gan Moer suggested the gold standard for China today. It is probably because he is old and has lost sight of things and does not know China's actual situation, so he is doing things perfunctorily. If Gan Moer wants to preserve his reputation as a scholar, he should regret his mistakes. He said that promoting the gold standard and the imaginary gold standard is a kind of currency system reform plan, which can be forgiven even if it is wrong, but the people of the time actually used this standard to rescue the high price of gold and the cheap price of silver. It is really absurd and unparalleled. There are already many critics of this point, so I will not say more. In short, once the government implements the gold standard or the illusory gold standard, our country's silver price and silver exchange rate will inevitably plummet. It is really a suicide policy to quench thirst with poison. As the saying goes, adding fuel to the fire is more like this. I hope that the people of the country will study more and not take the national economy and the people's livelihood as a child's play for experimentation. Fortunately, fortunately." Mr. Xu spoke eloquently to this point, and the reporter from the Continental News Agency asked again, "Then, what is the way for our country to improve the currency system today?" He replied, "It is undeniable that our country's currency system is chaotic, and it is imperative to rectify it. However, this is a major matter that cannot be resolved in three or two words. In short, given the situation in our country, it is not appropriate to adopt any gold standard, and there is no need to adopt it. The only way to improve our country's currency system at present is to change the tael to the yuan, rectify the issuance of subsidiary coins and banknotes, and wait for the reform proposals of the currency systems of various countries before considering the situation in our country and determining a direction. It is not too late."</p>

<p>Buyer Commanded to Resolve Within Three Days</p>

He thanked the Chinese staff of the company for their enthusiastic assistance and the workers for their united action. He hoped that all workers would be firm and determined and would fight to the death and would not resume work until they achieve their goals.

The decision was made to submit a request to the Municipal Party Department to forward it to the Central Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest. The entire group approved.

<h3>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Vigorously Promotes Domestic Silk Products</h3>
<p>Separate Orders to Investigate Tax Rates</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has stated that the annual sales of silk and satin products from our country to overseas and remote Mongolian and Tibetan areas are approximately tens of millions of taels. In order to promote domestic products and encourage exports to develop the industry, it is urgent to investigate the preferences of local societies and the import tax rates levied on these products in order to start the process. Yesterday, the Ministry issued separate orders to overseas Chinese chambers of commerce and chambers of commerce in Mongolian and Tibetan areas to comply with the investigation and report on the current and historical tax rates levied on domestic silk products transported to the location of the chamber of commerce, the preferences of various places for the color green, patterns, and materials of domestic silk products, which items sell the most in each location, and whether there are other silk products from other countries being transported and sold in the location in succession in order to plan the process.</p>

<p>○ Silk Factories Resume Full-Day Work Starting Yesterday Shanghai silk factories previously stopped summer vacations and reduced working hours to half-day work in the morning or three-quarters of the day due to the weak sales of Chinese silk in the European and American markets and the abnormal heat, with silk reeling female workers sweating profusely and unable to work. Now that the heat has gradually subsided and silk sales in Europe and America have also become slightly more active, the silk factories in both the Chinese and foreign concessions have resumed full-day work starting yesterday.</p>
<h3>Japan's Autumn Cocoon Production Declines</h3>
<p>Japanese Government Adjusts Silk Market Measures</p>
<p>The silkworm season in Japan generally starts earlier than in our country. This year, the spring and summer cocoons in that country both had bountiful harvests. However, since the new silk entered the market, sales in Europe have been sluggish, and market prices have plummeted, almost to the point of collapse. With the stockpile of silk growing daily, silk merchants have been unable to maintain operations and proposed a shutdown on August 1st to reduce silk production. The Japanese government, recognizing the overproduction, urgently sought to regulate the situation. Therefore, it decided to reduce the amount of autumn silkworms raised. Currently, the autumn silkworm season in various prefectures is at the second or third molt. This year, the amount of autumn silkworms raised in each area has generally been reduced by 20-30% compared to last year, with Oita Prefecture reducing the most, at 60%. It is predicted that Japan's autumn cocoon production will inevitably decline significantly this year.</p>
<p>○ Uniform Compliance with Industry Regulations - The Municipal Government Has Forwarded the Case to the Executive Yuan for Approval</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously passed a resolution at a citywide representative meeting that all businesses in the same industry should comply with the regulations approved for registration by the respective trade associations, even if they are not members. The case was submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for review. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has now submitted it to the Municipal Government. Within the Municipal Government's Instruction No. 6383, it is stated that approval has been granted to forward the case to the Executive Yuan for further instructions. Once the instructions are received, they will be communicated for compliance.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Issues the Original Text of the Land Law - Ordering All Bureaus, Districts, and Municipal Committee Offices to Comply</p>
<p>The Municipal Government received an instruction from the Executive Yuan, stating, "For your information, the National Government's 384th instruction has been received, stating: Since the Land Law has been formulated and officially promulgated, except for the effective date and areas, which should be specified separately by order, the original text of the law is copied and sent for your information and to be forwarded to your subordinates for their information as well. This order, etc." A copy of the Land Law is enclosed. Besides separate orders, the original text of the law is copied and sent for your information and compliance. This has been forwarded to all bureaus, districts, and municipal committee offices for compliance.</p>
<h3>The County Construction Bureau Receives Order to Investigate Dikes and Embankments</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Construction Bureau received an instruction yesterday from the Jiangsu Construction Department, stating, "For compliance matters, it is noted that Jiangsu Province's terrain is low-lying, making dikes and embankments crucial. However, the existing earthen works have long been neglected and are frequently breached. Reclaiming land from surrounding beaches was originally a way to enrich the people, but over time, malpractices have arisen. Floating sand washes away with rain, and the water surface is released. The waterways are becoming increasingly constricted, causing great harm. A thorough investigation should be conducted to facilitate rectification. Besides separate orders, two copies of the dike and embankment investigation form are enclosed. The bureau chief is ordered to conduct a detailed investigation of all existing dikes and embankments in the county's various townships within one month of receiving this document, filling out the form accordingly. Dikes and embankments that are in the planning stage should be filled out on a separate form with a sketch. Water conservancy is an important political matter, so do not delay."</p>
<h3>Customs Differentiates Between Chinese and Foreign Merchant Ships During Inspections</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications Finds the New Measures Very Unequal</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that the new regulations for inspecting Chinese and foreign merchant ships newly drafted by the Customs Marine Department are as follows: (1) All Chinese ships will be inspected by customs ship inspectors. However, in remote areas or where it is inconvenient to send customs inspectors to be stationed, or where the cost of stationing inspectors is too high, non-customs inspectors may be used instead. However, customs reserves the right to re-inspect these inspected ships and will charge half the inspection fee. (2) Foreign ships operating along the Chinese coast or rivers must have inspection certificates and passenger licenses issued by their respective national inspectors. The passenger license regulations issued by various countries may not be entirely the same. However, the method of tonnage measurement should still follow the regulations promulgated by Chinese Customs, and the right to re-inspect and charge inspection fees is reserved. The Ministry previously believed that regardless of whether the ships are Chinese or foreign, they should be inspected by customs inspectors in accordance with the regulations, to ensure equal treatment. The proposed method of inspecting Chinese ships in the first item is appropriate. However, if re-inspection is required, the inspection fees and salaries of the original inspectors can be paid from the relevant revenue, so there is no need to worry excessively. Even if it is difficult to implement immediately, it can be started in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places, and then gradually expanded to other ports. However, foreign ships sailing along the Chinese coast and the Yangtze River have always held only a Yangtze River license. The Ministry believes that the Yangtze River license is specifically for ships operating on the Yangtze River. It is unclear why foreign ships operating along the coast are allowed to use this type of license. This is inconsistent with the principle of equal treatment. The Ministry requests that the Ministry of Finance still formulate uniform regulations in accordance with the previously established principle of equal treatment for Chinese and foreign ships and send them to the Ministry for review.</p>

<h3>Huang Yilai Eagerly Seeking His Family</h3>
<p>Abducted by Bandits Fifteen Years Ago</p>
<p>Sold from Guangdong to Hong Kong</p>
<p>Thinking of His Parents, Accumulating Thoughts into Sickness</p>
<p>Submits a Letter to This Newspaper, Entrusting Us to Search</p>
<p>Yesterday, a person named Huang Yilai submitted a letter to this newspaper from Guangdong, requesting that we use a small space in the newspaper to publish his tragic history of being abducted by bandits and sold to a foreign land at a young age. This is so that his parents, after seeing it, will know that he is still alive, drifting in the sea of dust, and longing for the reunion of his family. This newspaper believes that the letter writer has experienced the most painful experiences in life and sincerely hopes that his family can reunite and enjoy the happiness of family life. Mr. Huang's thoughts of his parents haunt his dreams, and his filial piety is inexhaustible. Not only is his story worth spreading, but it can also save declining customs and encourage later generations. The original letter's wording was obscure and inconvenient to read, so we have refined it according to the facts and divided it as follows:</p>
<p>Separated from His Parents for Fifteen Years</p>
<p>Huang Yilai does not know his real name. As a child, he was sold to the Huang family in Taishan by bandits, hence the surname Huang. His native place is Guangdong. When he was four or five years old, he was playing alone outside his house when he was abducted by bandits and transported to Hong Kong to be sold. After more than a year, he returned to Chaosha Township in Taishan, where he lived for more than ten years. He has almost forgotten the situation of his hometown, only remembering that he was abducted at the age of I</p>
<h3>Huang Yilai's Recent Photo</h3>
<p>I</p>
<p>His mother was still holding a younger brother in her arms and fell into the hands of bandits. Afterwards, he seemed to be imprisoned in a huge house, guarded by an old woman. There were also many young children in the next room who were also in danger. After living there for two days, two women came and took them to a ship and sailed to Hong Kong. Huang is now twenty years old. Calculating, he has been separated from his parents for fifteen years. He was sold to the Huang family and returned to Taishan. After arriving in Hong Kong, he was sold by the bandits to Yuanlang. The Huang family of Taishan named him Huang Yilai and has used it ever since. After living for a year, he returned to Chaosha Township in Taishan with his master and lived there for ten years. Huang has grown up and went to Guangzhou to seek a career, but due to unfamiliarity with the place, he made no progress. He had no choice but to work in a hair shop, earning only enough to make ends meet. However, he always missed his parents and asked everyone he met, but there was no clue at first. Afterwards, he searched the newspapers, and all the newspapers in Hong Kong Province published advertisements to find them, but unfortunately there was no good news.</p>
<p>Searching for his parents to comfort his longing. He spent so much time thinking about them that it accumulated into sickness, but there was no solution. He remembered that his mother used to work in a certain silk hair weaving factory run by both Chinese and Westerners. There were many such weaving factories in the Suhang area, so he thought that his mother must be in Shanghai or Hangzhou. He then mailed the above-mentioned situation and a photo of himself to this newspaper, entrusting us to search for her. He said that the photo is sixty to seventy percent similar to his biological mother. He deeply hopes that those who know will communicate with Huang in order to meet as soon as possible. His mailing address is c/o Circulation Daily News, Gough Street, Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Police Rights Are Preparing for a Serious Negotiation</h3>
<p>A dispute has arisen over police rights in the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads Area. Public Security Bureau Director Yuan Liang had ordered the Sixth District Director to be prepared and not to back down in order to protect national sovereignty. However, the Municipal Council still sent patrols, which has not been resolved. Director Yuan had requested the Municipal Government to negotiate with the leading consul-general as soon as possible, but there has been no concrete response. Therefore, the Municipal Government consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest to the delegation over the issue of Extra-Settlement Roads. It is reported that Minister Wang approved the consultation and has already telegraphed the Shanghai Office to investigate the foreign encroachment situation first before reviewing it.</p>
<h3>Meteorological Research Institute Reports on the Path of the Typhoon</h3>
<p>The Meteorological Research Institute of the National Central Research Institute in Nanjing reported on the path of the typhoon from July 24 to August 2, 1930: Typhoons (commonly known as hurricanes) in the Pacific Ocean are most prevalent in July, August, and September. At the turn of July and August, it is the period when typhoons begin to develop. Typhoons originate in the western Pacific Ocean, between 5 and 15 degrees latitude and 135 and 150 degrees longitude. They initially move northwest and then split, with some heading towards the South China Sea via Luzon and others heading northeast towards Japan along the Ryukyu Islands. These have little impact on China and are not worth mentioning. However, typhoons that originate in the Pacific Ocean, pass through Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands, and enter the East China Sea, or head north along the coast, or land in the mainland from Fujian and Zhejiang, cause white waves to soar, sink boats, and overturn ships on the sea surface, and cause strong winds to rage, destroy houses, and injure people when they land. All areas within the scope of the typhoon are greatly damaged. The temperature in the whole year is highest in July. This year, on July 23 and 24, the temperature in Nanjing reached 38 degrees Celsius, which is more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit, exceeding the highest record of the previous two years. It is easiest to have storms (typhoons are a type of storm) during the hottest time. The storms tend to move towards hot places. This typhoon came or may have been due to the high temperature here. This typhoon was discovered in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 and initially moved northwest before turning west. By the morning of the 26th, its center was close to the southwest sea of Naha. The area from southern Japan to the Ryukyu Islands began to suffer from wind disasters. Trains stopped, telecommunications were interrupted, and salt fields and crops were damaged. On the 27th, its center passed through the Ryukyu Islands and entered the East China Sea. The coastal areas were greatly affected by the wind disasters. Ships traveling north and south were stopped. Nanjing had thunderstorms many times on the morning of the day and the afternoon of the 26th, as a precursor to the typhoon. The typhoon forms a vortex motion with a very wide range. Thunderstorms are most likely to occur on the edge of its advance. On the morning of the 28th, the center of the typhoon gradually moved southwest to the southern part of the East China Sea, approaching northern Taiwan and then turning to the northwest. By 2 PM, it approached the vicinity of Wenzhou. Since then, the wind force in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has increased and the weather has deteriorated. This is a sign of the approach of the typhoon. As usual, the typhoon can pass through the lower reaches of the Yangtze River the next day. Due to the pressure of the Japanese high pressure, the route was changed and retreated to the southwest. In the afternoon, it turned to the northwest from the vicinity of Fuzhou and moved to the junction of Zhejiang and Jiangxi, lingering between Quanzhou and Shangrao for about three days. The path of the typhoon has been moving north and northeast since it landed in the country. Now, due to the obstruction of the northern high pressure, it has been slow to advance. Nanjing was affected by the typhoon's northward movement on the 30th. The weather changed abruptly, with strong winds, showers, thunder, and lightning. The rain continued intermittently throughout the day. On the 31st, the weather was still bad, with continuous rain and unabated wind. It can be seen that the center of the typhoon is approaching. On August 1, the wind was quite strong, and the wind direction turned from northeast to southeast. The typhoon will move north from the vicinity of Jiujiang, Jiangxi. Although the typhoon is fierce, it has been weakening for a long time after landing due to the obstruction of high mountains and forests, so it will not cause a huge wind disaster. On the 2nd, the wind direction in Nanjing turned from southeast to south, the wind force gradually weakened, the air pressure increased, and the weather turned fine. It can be seen that the typhoon has left the territory of Jiangxi and is heading northwest.</p>
<p>According to reports, the damage caused by the typhoon in various places included the following: On the 26th, Tokyo reported that the river near the Okagami Station on the Niigata Prefecture Shimokoshi Railway was flooded due to heavy rain, turning the surrounding area into a sea. Trains were suspended, and telecommunications were interrupted in Aomori, Akita, and other prefectures. The loss of houses was quite tragic. According to the Tokyo report on the 29th, this year is the year of typhoons. The area from Taiwan to Kyushu has been threatened by typhoons for days. Salt fields and crops have been heavily damaged.</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai News, on the 29th, the wind turned and the sea was rough. Large ships continued to be suspended. The Huangpu River tide rose, and the land and water were almost level in the low-lying areas on both sides. It was also reported that the Japanese ship Yueyang Maru encountered an accident at the mouth of Wusong. The Dahua ship was damaged by wind and waves while being thrown ashore in the Huangpu River and could not sail. It was also reported that a typhoon struck Shanghai on the evening of the 30th, becoming more severe in the middle of the night, with heavy rain. Three or four heavily loaded cargo ships in the Huangpu River were in danger. The damage included injuries, sinking ships, and loss of goods. According to the Beijing News, on the evening of the 30th, many boatmen on the river surface in Xiaguan said that the flagpoles and anchor chains were broken by lightning.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Hankou at 2 PM on the 1st, many ships in Wuhan were sunk by the hurricane, with losses estimated at tens of thousands of yuan. It is a pity that there are no telegraphic reports on the damage in other coastal areas, so it is impossible to record them. The disaster is thought to be more severe than in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>A Chance Encounter with a Niece in a Brothel</h3>
<p>A Cry of "Uncle" Followed by Streams of Tears</p>
<p>Redeemed for 230 Yuan</p>
<p>Zhao Mingxuan, a dried goods merchant from Taixing, came to Shanghai to purchase goods. Yesterday, accompanied by his friend Zhang Shouhe, he went to a Qin-owned cured meat shop on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession for entertainment. That evening, he was accompanied by a prostitute named Xiaolanbao. Unexpectedly, Lanbao found Zhao extremely familiar. After staring at him for a long time, she burst into tears and cried out, "Uncle, save me!" Zhao was shocked and asked her the reason. Lanbao then explained everything in detail. It turned out that Lanbao was the daughter of Zhao's sister, who had married Zheng Ziyifu in Xicheng, Cambodia, a long time ago. It had been four years since she had returned to her mother's home, and there had been no news. Although people had been sent to inquire, the Zheng family falsely claimed she was doing well. Because of family affairs, she couldn't return to Ning. When Lanbao's mother heard she was healthy, she simply let it be. However, Zheng Ziyifu was extremely lazy and, in addition to gambling, also liked to frequent brothels. Over the years, he had squandered all the ancestral properties, leaving nothing. Destitute, he mortgaged his wife to a wealthy household in the same town to be a concubine. Lanbao, unable to bear the abuse of the first wife, secretly fled to Shanghai a month ago, intending to find work as a servant in a Yangbang employment agency. Unfortunately, she was deceived by bandits and sold to the Qin family as a prostitute. Only then did Zhao learn the whole story. He was filled with indignation and resentment. He then negotiated with the madam, willing to pay 150 yuan to redeem Lanbao. Seeing the profit, the madam insisted on 300 yuan. The two sides argued, almost leading to a conflict. After mediation, a deal was reached at 230 yuan. It is said that Zhao immediately returned to his hometown with Lanbao to prepare a lawsuit against the Zheng family.</p>

<h3>Shoe Stores Agree to Raise Prices</h3>
<p>Add 5% to the Original Price</p>
<p>The shoe stores in Yilong Lane, Old West Gate of this city, including Yichangxiang, Wangshunxing, and Lanhengtai, have, due to the recent high cost of gold and silver, the high price of all goods, and the repeated increases in workers' wages, invited the store owners and managers of Yixinglong, Laodechang, Shenrongji, Renhe, Lao Wangshunxing, Yong Yongxinglong, Fuxingxiang, and other 11 stores to discuss increasing sales prices. As a result, it was agreed to increase the original sales price by 5% effective immediately. Each signed and sealed the agreement on the spot, stipulating penalties for non-compliance.

<h3>Life is Like Morning Dew</h3>
<p>Shoe Store Employee Dies Suddenly</p>
<p>Chen Gendi, a nineteen-year-old Ningbo native and employee of Tianlu Shoe Store on Shanxi Road in the Public Concession, served diligently in the store. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the employee suddenly suffered a severe attack of acute illness. The manager sent him by car to the Fulv Hospital in the Jinjiaqigan area of the city for treatment. Due to ineffective rescue, he only suffered from the illness for a few hours before he died. The hospital notified the Tianlu Shoe Store to inform the family of the deceased to collect the body.</p>
<h3>Young People Must Not Be Absurd</h3>
<p>Shen Yanzhou Can Serve as a Warning</p>
<p>Frequenting Prostitutes and Contracting Drug Addiction Leads to Suicide Attempt</p>
<p>Shen Yanzhou, a young man from Wusong in his early twenties, was a handsome, well-dressed young man who worked as an artist in a library, earning over a hundred yuan a month. Around 9:00 PM the night before, Shen went to the Railway Hotel on North Railway Station Road and opened room number 36. He falsely registered as Zhou Jin, a local. By 11:00 AM the next morning, he had not yet gotten up. A tea server called outside the door and received no response. They forced the door open and found him lying stiffly on the bed. They immediately reported to the cashier, who reported to the Hongkou Police Station via telephone. Detectives arrived at the scene and found a leather wallet in his pocket containing a two-inch photograph of himself. He was then hired a car and sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. After being injected and rescued by the doctor, he gradually recovered. According to Shen, he contracted syphilis from excessive frequenting of prostitutes, which led to the loss of his job. He had no face to return home to his parents, and lacked the ability to make money in Shanghai, so he had to take sleeping pills to commit suicide and end his life early. Young people are weak-willed, and the results are so profound. I sincerely hope that those who suffer from the same disease as Yanzhou will turn back as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The Result of a Prodigal Son</h3>
<p>A Warning to Parents Who Spoil Their Children</p>
<p>A male corpse was found floating in the Xiahebang ditch in Caoyang Road, West Shanghai, a few days ago. The upper body was naked, and the lower body was wearing broken Xiangyun gauze trousers, barefoot and without shoes. As the family's address was unknown, a coffin was prepared. It is now known that the deceased's nickname was Chunnan, a native of Chuansha, Pudong. His father, Zhang Jingfu, was a wine merchant living in Rende Lane on Yangshupu Road in the Public Concession. He had accumulated a modest fortune over the years. He only had Chunnan as his son, so he spoiled him excessively. However, he was solitary and did not communicate with relatives and friends. After Jingfu passed away the year before last, Chunnan became even more unbridled, often associating with profligate women. He spent dozens of yuan a day without regard. He frequented entertainment venues in Shanghai, exhausting all the property left by his father last year. Recently, he specialized in borrowing money to make a living. However, relatives and friends could only provide emergency assistance, not alleviate poverty, so they have recently avoided him. Surrounded by difficulties, Chunnan had no choice but to commit suicide.</p>
<h3>Adulterous Couple Caught in Jiangwan</h3>

He entrusted someone to search for her everywhere. He was informed of the situation by a friend. Han was furious that his jade had been defiled and could not bear the reality of the situation. Yesterday, he rushed to capture the adulterous couple and called the police, who detained them in the 5th Precinct and transferred them to the local court for questioning.</p>

Cao has a wife named Cao Jishi, who is twenty-five years old. The two women are unusually close to each other, even more than siblings. However, Cao Jishi is a promiscuous woman who has influenced Mo Yatou to be just as unrestrained. Cao Jishi is involved with Qin Deyu, and Mo Yatou is involved with Wang Fucheng. The two men and two women each packed up their belongings and bundles of clothes and fled together. The weather was dark, and they ran wildly on the railway. However, strict curfews have been in place lately, so both shameless couples were detained and questioned severely, looking pale and shaken. They were detained in the 5th Precinct.

<h3>A Man and a Woman Did Something Shameful</h3>
<p>A Loud Noise on the Stairs Caused Great Alarm</p>
<p>An Old Woman Became Suspicious</p>
<p>Zhou Amao, a native of Luodian, lives at No. 62, Xilong, Haichaosi South Street, outside Xiaonanmen. His wife, Jin, is nineteen years old and is a beautiful woman with a romantic nature. Zhou makes a living by driving a boat and is often away from home, so he is not used to sleeping alone. As a result, she secretly became acquainted with Qu Huiwen, a twenty-five-year-old Wuxi native who works as a tailor in Caoxiewan. Whenever Zhou was away, Qu would sneak into her home to meet her. This had been going on for some time. The night before last, because Zhou was away working, Qu took the opportunity to go again and slept with her. Around 11:00 PM, a friend of Zhou's, Mr. Chen, came to visit Zhou. Because Chen was a friend of Zhou, he entered the house and went upstairs. Suddenly hearing the sound of footsteps, Jin suspected that her husband had returned home. In a panic, she woke Qu and told him that her husband had returned. Qu was also alarmed and his face turned pale. He immediately jumped out of bed, put on his clothes, and quietly snuck out. In his confusion, he saw the door of Mao Chen, an elderly woman from Tongzhou who lived in the same house, was ajar, so he leaned in and entered to hide. Mao was also panicking in her bedroom. The window of Mao Chen's bedroom was opposite the window of her bedroom, so she climbed out of the window in a hurry and then climbed into Mao Chen's room. Mao, who was over fifty years old, was fast asleep when she suddenly heard footsteps and woke up in fright. She got up to check and saw a pale-faced young man standing in the room. Suspicious and frightened, she was about to shout loudly when Qu silenced her, saying, "I am not a ghost. Don't be afraid, old mother." Soon after, she saw a woman climbing in through the window, her clothes disheveled and her expression panicked. Mao was even more alarmed at this point, screamed, dashed out the door, and ran into the street, shouting for the police. Zhou Qingxuan, the guard at the 26th guard post there, heard this and rushed over to inquire about the situation. He immediately went upstairs and detained Qu and Zhou Jin and took them to the 1st Precinct. He sent a written report to the Public Security Bureau requesting arrangements to be made for the individuals.</p>

<h3>Sun Adong is Not Without Suspicion in the Case of a Woman Running Away</h3>
<p>Ordered to Post Bail for Six Months for Further Investigation</p>
<p>Zhang Zhengang, represented by lawyer Yan Jinyu in the French Court, criminally accused that the plaintiff's eldest daughter, Yunbao, who is seventeen years old, worked in a sock factory and then packed coffee in a coffee factory. Sun Adong, whom she had known for a long time, repeatedly enticed Yunbao. Last month, Yunbao ran away without a trace and took away many ornaments. The defendant, Bao, is guilty of abduction and is requested to be ordered to hand over Yunbao to the case. The plaintiff said that before her daughter ran away, the defendant often came to her house and seduced her in every possible way, and said that he would marry Yunbao as his concubine. She refuses this because the defendant is already married and how can he marry Yunbao as a concubine, as she is a business person. Not long after that, she disappeared. The defendant must have abducted her. It is requested that the case be investigated strictly. Sun Adong said that Yunbao used to work in a sock factory and had her meals delivered to his house. She had not been to his house for two months before she ran away. The plaintiff had filed a complaint with the local hall accusing a woman surnamed Mou of abducting his daughter and asked people to testify. They did not agree, so they held a grudge and brought the case. The judge, Zhu, instructed that although there was no solid evidence in this case, the defendant was not without suspicion. Sun Adong was ordered to post bail for six months for further investigation.</p>

<p>Zhang Baohua, a native of Songjiang and owner of the Dongzhong He Taihua Hotel on Fuzhou Road, married Lu Lijuan in 1925. At first, they were in harmony, but because Lu often returned to Ningbo, their love gradually faded. Litigation began in 1927, and the judge advised both parties to go out and reconcile. However, Lu has been missing ever since and has not been seen for three years. Zhang cannot wait any longer and has hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Special District Local Court requesting a divorce. The case opened the other day. Since the defendant could not be served, the court should appoint a special agent to defend her in accordance with the regulations so that she can enjoy her legal rights. Judge Yang instructed the plaintiff to pay the special agency fee and wait for the hearing and verification.</p>

<p>Both Robbers Captured and the Stolen Goods Recovered Intact</p>
<p>Two men, wearing blue and white long shirts, came to the Huade Clock and Watch Store at No. 361 Nanjing Road the other day at dusk, claiming to buy watches. The store staff courteously received them and took out watches for them to choose from. Unexpectedly, both were robbers. The robber in white suddenly took out a pistol and threatened them to keep silent. The store owner, Chen Duomin, relying on his strength, took advantage of the armed robber's unpreparedness and rushed forward, grabbing his hand tightly and wrestling with him. The robber in blue then grabbed the watches displayed on the counter. He was also tackled by other staff, only grabbing twelve yuan, the price of a watch paid by another customer, and fleeing into the neighborhood. Nearby detectives rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm and first intercepted the robber in blue, recovering all the stolen goods intact. They then entered the store again and arrested the robber in white, seizing his gun, which contained eight bullets. Both were taken to the Laozha Police Station. The robber in blue confessed his name was Li Yuancong, and the robber in white confessed his name was Shen Shuzhi, both from Shandong. The police chief ordered them to be strictly detained pending delivery to the Special District Local Court for questioning.</p>
<p>○Embezzlement by an Employee of a Rosewood Store Sued Zhang Fukang, the owner of Zhang Yuanchun Rosewood Store on Zilai Street in the French Concession, hired a lawyer to sue in the Criminal Court that he had previously hired Duanmu Chuanbo as an employee, but not long after he was employed, he embezzled and privately collected account money from various households, amounting to thousands of gold. In August of last year, the plaintiff discovered this and, knowing that he was in the wrong, begged someone to intercede and issue a note for 2,400 yuan. The plaintiff allowed him to reform and rehired him, giving him a monthly salary of 40 yuan and subsidies for splitting accounts, etc., of 60 yuan, which was a special courtesy, a pioneering move in the industry. However, the defendant relapsed into his old ways over time and privately collected accounts again, amounting to thousands of yuan. This situation is a violation of embezzlement. He is requested to be investigated and the money be recovered. The defendant also hired a lawyer to defend him. It was announced that the debate was over and the ruling was being awaited. On the date of the ruling, both parties were summoned to the case. Judge Zhu ruled that the defendant Duanmu Chuanbo privately collected account money, which constituted suspicion of embezzlement in business. He was sentenced to two months of imprisonment with a one-year reprieve. As for the privately collected funds, the two parties should verify the exact amount and the defendant should be ordered to pay the full amount. The note signed for 2,400 yuan for the accounts collected before August 1929 should be verified and settled together. The court fees will be borne by the defendant.</p>

He said that his name was Chen Quan郎, twenty-one years old, a native of Chongming. He had recently lost his job and his clothes were almost gone. Forced by livelihood, he had been without food for two days and had to use a bamboo pole with an iron hook to sneak to Gao's fence gate and steal a woman's cloth shirt and pants and an oilcloth.

<p>Qin Xu, a twenty-five-year-old Tongzhou woman renting a house at No. 128 Dongchang Road, Lanni Ferry, Pudong, had been suffering from abdominal pain for a long time. The other day, she asked Luo Xiangfu, a traveling doctor, to treat her. Luo falsely took her pulse and gave her a pack of pills, claiming that they were very effective. She promised to reward him handsomely after she was cured. Unexpectedly, the pills were not only ineffective, but also caused vomiting and diarrhea. The incident was reported and patrolman Wang Zhaofan of the Health Bureau took Luo to the 3rd District Public Security Bureau. He confessed the details. Luo said that he was thirty-four years old, a native of Yancheng, and lived in Yangjia Ferry, Pudong, selling pills as a business. He had some medical knowledge and only charged Xu a small amount of 0.2 yuan for the pills, which he had not yet received. He asked for leniency. The district chief ruled that Luo should not sell fake medicine while telling the truth and ordered him to be fined three yuan and to register with the Health Bureau in accordance with the regulations. He may not practice medicine in the territory until he is approved.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Automobiles Cruising at Night</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau Director Yuan has issued a notice prohibiting automobiles from speeding and cruising at night. As there have been reports of accidents caused by speeding automobiles, he issued a special order to the district offices yesterday, stating that, as it is the summer season and the weather is hot, the residents of the city often speed and cruise in automobiles, or even increase the speed of driving to overtake each other, which often causes accidents. Strict measures must be taken to prevent danger. In addition to issuing notices and orders, you are ordered to pay attention to the matter at all times. If you find any cases of speeding automobiles and overtaking each other, you should immediately detain and punish them in accordance with the law. This order is of utmost importance.</p>
<h3>Wife Unwilling to Work as a Servant</h3>
<p>Trapped in a Dilemma, He Tries to Jump into the Huangpu River</p>
<p>Fortunately, He Was Pulled Back by the Police</p>

Mr. Wei then lectured, using scientific methods to explain the reasons for the bankruptcy of current teacher-student relationships in three parts: (1) The most important relationship between people is the brain. (2) Why does society as a whole lack good relationships between people? This is due to the use of religious teaching methods and military-national management methods. (3) Why is the worst relationship the teacher-student relationship? Students with high grades will inevitably have a deep relationship with the teacher, and vice versa. The lecture was passionate, with expressive gestures and eye contact. Everyone was amused. He concluded that Chinese education imitates the West.

<h3>Generally Settled</h3>
<h3>Japan-U.S. Swimming Competition to be Held in Tokyo in Mid-August Next Year</h3>
<h3>Japanese Swimming Federation to Cover All Expenses for U.S. Athletes</h3>
<p>The Japan Swimming Federation, in preparation for attending the 1932 World Games, previously resolved to invite several top-tier American swimmers to Tokyo next year for a Japan-U.S. competition, entrusting Mr. Muramatsu, captain of the Meiji University swimming team currently in Hawaii for international competitions, to handle the arrangements, as reported earlier. It has now been learned that the Federation received a reply from Mr. Muramatsu stating that the negotiations were very successful. Top-tier athletes on the island, such as the Furnap brothers, Garrie, Zorina, and Naeiry, have all expressed their willingness to come to Tokyo, provided the Japanese side covers the expenses.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Federation convened an emergency board meeting to discuss the matter. The consensus was that hosting American athletes for a competition would be an unprecedented event and a great contribution to the Japanese swimming community. The Federation should bear all expenses for the American athletes and decided to hold the competition at the Meiji Jingu Stadium from August 13th to 25th next year. This has already been communicated to Mr. Muramatsu.</p>
<p>According to reports, next year's event will undoubtedly be the grandest in the history of Japanese swimming. It remains to be seen how Japanese short-distance stars like Takaishi, Katayama, Miyamoto, and Takahashi, and middle- and long-distance runners like the Yokoyama and Takemura brothers, and Makino, and backstrokers like Irie and Katayama will perform. Generally, except for the breaststroke, the Japanese are weaker than the Americans in freestyle and backstroke. However, Yokoyama's middle and long-distance races will be a fierce competition with Garrie (elder brother) and Furnap.</p>
<p>The American athletes whose participation has already been confirmed are:</p>
<p>Furnap: The American top middle-distance runner who set a new world record in the 800 meters at the Hawaii Games.</p>
<p>Garrie (elder brother): An up-and-coming American athlete who defeated veteran Furnap and took first place in the 400 meters at the Hawaii Games.</p>
<p>Garrie (younger brother): An American newcomer specializing in short-distance and backstroke, who achieved a stunning 59.6 seconds in the 100 meters at the Hawaii Games.</p>
<p>Zorina: Broke the world record in the 400 meters at the Hawaii Games.</p>
<p>Naeiry: Third in the high jump and second in the springboard at the previous World Games, currently the world's number one.</p>
<h3>Japan Agrees to Have an Asian Zone for the Davis Cup</h3>
<p>(Tokyo News) The World Davis Cup tennis competition has historically been divided into European and American zones. Each year, the zones compete first, and then the winners of the two zones compete against the defending champion to determine the title. Although countries such as China, Japan, India, and the Philippines have joined in recent years, the competition remains limited to the European and American zones, which is inconvenient. Mr. Davis, the donor of the cup and current Governor-General of the Philippines, recognizes the rapid progress of tennis skills in the Far East and has proposed adding an "Asian Zone" starting next year. This proposal has been well-received by American人士.  According to Mr. Hari Shigetaka, a director of the Japan Lawn Tennis Association, the establishment of an Asian zone is necessary and should not be delayed. This move would greatly benefit all teams in the Far East. However, considering the current situation, there are still too many participants in the European zone. A thorough redistribution is necessary, and Japan may propose this to the conference in the future.</p>

<h3>Book and Newspaper Reviews</h3>
<h3>Reading "The Mission of the Nationalist Literary Movement" by Wenzhi</h3>
<h3>"Avant-Garde Weekly," Issues 5 &amp; 6</h3>
<p>Every movement, by its very nature, has a mission it aspires to fulfill. The declaration of this mission represents the movement's self-assessment, and it is also something that the general public urgently needs to understand. This self-analysis not only clearly points out the path that this great movement seeks to forge ahead on but also ignites strong and enthusiastic sympathy from the public, enabling the movement's power to unfold actively, quickly break through all obstacles, and create a new situation.</p>
<p>Since the proponents of the Nationalist Literary Movement outlined its tenets and established its irrefutable theories, a new phenomenon has clearly emerged in China's literary scene. This has led China's literary world from a distorted state of development to an awareness path centered on the entire nation. Everyone knows that in such a difficult era, with suffering and oppression coming from all directions, the only priorities are national self-determination and the survival and evolution of the nation. The recent nationalist movement in politics has had a history of struggle, but ultimately, due to the public's widespread apathy and numbness toward national consciousness, it has not achieved significant results in politics. Therefore, it is necessary to use the power of literature to first instill national consciousness in the hearts of the people, consolidate the front lines, and fight for the nation. Politics and literature are closely related; politics can influence literature, and literature can also influence politics. Therefore, the responsibility of today's writers should absolutely be based on the nation. The Declaration of the Nationalist Literary Movement has already made strict provisions for the mission of the Nationalist Literary Movement in literature: "(1) To establish a national consciousness in the formation of literature; (2) To promote the will of national progress and development; (3) To eliminate all thoughts that hinder national progress; (4) To express the history of all national struggles." However, even with these provisions, there has been no clear explanation to deepen the impression and understanding of the general public, which everyone naturally considers a pity. Although the theory of Nationalist Literature has been accepted, the internal contents of Nationalist Literature are still somewhat vague and unclear. Fortunately, in issues 5 and 6 of the Avant-Garde Weekly, founded by the proponents of the Nationalist Literary Movement, Zhu Daxin's "The Mission of the Nationalist Literary Movement" provides a detailed explanation of the mission of the Nationalist Literary Movement. The author elaborates on the guidelines presented in the declaration, which is indeed a necessary undertaking. The Nationalist Literary Movement has taken another step deeper in discovering its value.</p>
<p>Arousing the awakening of national consciousness in great literature requires the unity of thought and action among all members of the nation to seek the survival, freedom, and evolution of the whole. Currently, most people often misinterpret the meaning of "nation" and "country," thinking that "a nation is the people living within the territory of a certain country," which is not a rigorous distinction and correction. Here, the author's understanding of the meaning of nation is a broad nationalism.</p>
<p>In addition to achieving the goals of survival, evolution, and freedom for oneself, one should not engage in aggression or oppression against other smaller nations. It is clear that all nations should have the right to self-determination.</p>
<p>The lack of national consciousness among the majority of people in China is an undeniable fact. Everyone only knows how to seek survival and happiness for themselves, even to the point of destroying the survival of the nation without regard. It is important to know that "a nation lacking national consciousness cannot recognize the relationship between the individual and the nation, cannot strive to plan for the survival and development of the nation, and a nation that does not know how to strive for self-preservation will be invaded or oppressed by foreign races, and if it does not resist, it will inevitably perish." The reason for this decline in national consciousness is, on the one hand, that the poison of autocratic politics is too deep. The rulers have suppressed it to such an extent that the collective action of national consciousness cannot be expressed at all. Secondly, the abnormal and special development of the family system has formed a narrow patriarchal society. Especially unfortunate is that in China, where national consciousness has declined to such an extent, some people have spread the so-called class consciousness, dividing the entire nation, truly plunging the nation into the abyss of destruction.</p>
<p>However, the so-called nation refers to all its members, and therefore the so-called nationalist literature naturally refers to works that are formed from the nation's standpoint and reflect the consciousness of life. Here, the author points out that "first, we should pay attention to all the literature circulating among the people and determine their value from the standpoint of the nation. In folk tales, legends, and folk songs, many have the purpose of seeking survival, freedom, and prosperity for the nation. Second, we should analyze and guide folk gatherings and entertainment. Actions such as welcoming gods and dragon boat races at least represent the expression of group consciousness, the action of organization and discipline, the dynamic or forward-moving state, and the expression of ardent emotions. All these points that conform to the national spirit should be recognized for their significance and developed. Third, the works of past intellectuals should be re-evaluated through nationalist criticism. Future works should be created from the national standpoint, must take the entire populace of the nation as the target, and utilize various different techniques to create forms that are adapted to and can be understood by the entire populace of the nation."</p>
<p>The second mission is to develop the will of national progress. The Chinese nation not only lacks the subjective conditions of national composition, which is national consciousness, but also the objective conditions of national composition, which are national characteristics, are also declining. However, this kind of situation can no longer be allowed to continue in the future. We should awaken and encourage the will of national progress and advance to excellence. Naturally, literary education is the most powerful. Because the real significance of literary education lies in nurturing everyone to be able to bring out the "power of creation" and "the will of progress." This is the element that breeds the "life force" of the nation. The author proposes here that our national character should at least have "ardent emotional expression, a brave and lively spirit, a belief in beauty, a healthy physique, the ability to create, the ability to organize, the habit of keeping order, and an indomitable will." This is urgently needed for the Chinese nation today to adapt to survival and evolution and to become strong.</p>
<p>The third mission is to eliminate all thoughts that hinder national progress. At present, the various chaotic thoughts in Chinese literature are indeed filled with a chaotic and unbearable state. The greatest hindrance to our national progress is the Proletarian Literary Movement, followed by feudal thought, decadent thought, and escapist thought. These kinds of thoughts cannot be allowed to exist in the main field of nationalist literature and must be vigorously eradicated.</p>
<p>The fourth mission is to express the history of the nation's struggles. In the past, although China has suffered several times from foreign invasions and uprisings, these were by no means the entire national movements of the Chinese nation. They were merely those heroes with imperial thoughts satisfying their desires to don the yellow robe and dominate the world. What did they have to do with our nation? Therefore, "what we want to express, in addition to the stories containing national thought left in folk legends, is the revolutionary history of the era with the aim of seeking independence and equality for the nation." The author also points out that in the future, we should absorb foreign cultures as much as possible to adapt to our needs, but we should pay attention to "freely choosing and freely absorbing, and absolutely not allow others to force us to be baptized." These are all things that should be expressed in nationalist literature.</p>
<p>After reading this article, one naturally feels that the Nationalist Literary Movement has opened up a bright and passionate realm. The reason I introduce it is also for this reason. Then, let us seek the arrival of a great era!</p>
<p>We firmly believe that only when nationalism can be deeply instilled in the minds of all members of the entire nation can the Chinese nation achieve the goal of maturity and excellence. At the same time, the literature of the Chinese nation can reach a great and immortal realm.</p>

The sale of this medicine every summer is purely a semi-obligatory matter. Therefore, each year, a certain amount of money is set aside from the surplus to make up for the loss of this medicine. As a result, its sales have also increased year by year, reaching as far as Singapore, the South Seas Islands, and other countries. This summer, the weather is extremely hot, and epidemics are prevalent, so seasonal medicines such as this anti-epidemic water, merit water, and brandy are selling very well, beyond expectations.
