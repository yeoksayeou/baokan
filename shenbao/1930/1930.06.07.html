<h3 id="c109">說明推舉代表辦法 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>必須於十日前依法推出　　上海特别市商整會定於本月二十一日召集全市同業公會會員代表大會即成立正式上海市商會現該會已通函各公會迅推代表惟對於代表人數及使用人計算方法多有未能明瞭者茲經秘書處詳細說明如下</p>
<p>（一）代表人數及使用人計算方法每一公會均得舉派代表一人但如果該工會所屬各商店之平均使用人數（因商店上下半年或每月使用人數或有不同故應未得其平均數）總合計算超過十五人者就其超過之人數每满十五人得增加代表一人惟至多少能過二十一人此項辦法使商業使用人較多之公會其在商會内之代表數目隨之增加比之以前商會每一公會往往僅舉出一二人爲商會會員以致會務往往被一二人所壟斷把持者其性質大不相同故此次公會舉派出席商會之代表應使數目盡量加多不能似以前之每會僅一二人即就會費負担而論以前上海總商會每增加會員一人應收會費一百元現則减至五十元故即以負担會費之數目爲標準以前僅能舉派二人者現在當可舉派四人矣至使用人數應就公會所屬之各商店總計並非指公會本身雇用之書記職工而言此層尤不可不明暸也</p>
<p>（二）代表產生之方法公會會員舉派之代表應由公會執行委員會推定給以委託書一面通知商整會如公會内部尙未依法改組仍沿用舊董事制度者則應由董事會推定之各業圑體整理委員會應由整理委員會推定之各公會舉派代表超過一人以上時並應就使用人較多之商店中舉派此爲商會法施行細則所規定至公司或商店之代表則應由董事會或股東及經理推定（三）商店會員之加入按照商會法凡本市别無同業或雖有同業而並無同業公會之組織時方得單獨加人商會爲商店會員但本市商店會員</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>尙有以下兩項之辦法（甲）該業雖有同業公會但該會並未來會登記或雖經　記而並未接受指導整理者應仍以無同業公會論該業商店仍得單獨加入商會爲商店會員（乙）一業以上</p>
<p>之同業組織如華商紗廠聯合會江浙皖絲廠繭業總公所江蘇火柴聯合會等因其圑體之組織根本與工商同業工會法不合故亦應以無同業工會論其會員仍得單獨加入商會至商店會員舉派之代表數目按照商會法規定自一人至三人</p>
<p>（四）會員代表之資格無論公會或商店其所舉派之代表必須以在本區域内經營商業之中華民國人民年在二十五歲以上者爲限如有下列各欵情事之一者不得充代表（甲）褫奪公權尙未復權者（乙）有有反革命行爲經法庭判决者（丙）受破產之宣告尙未復權者或經營商業因虧負倒閉尙未恢復信用者（丁）無行爲能力者即現行民法總則規定未逹法定年齡及精神喪失耗弱者之類</p>
<p>（五）代表應繳之會費每一公會或一商店應繳之基本會費因須經會員大會决定現尙未能收取但代表出席費則已經社會局轉呈工商部核准備案其徵收數目如下（甲）公會代表每人徵收出席費五十元外加償還建築公債三成捐欵十五元兩共六十五元（乙）商店代表每人徵收出席費三十元外加償還建築公債三成捐欵九元兩共三十九元以上出席費均應於推定代表通知商整會時隨同附繳</p>
<p>（六）舉派代表之期限公會或商店舉派代表按照商整會全體會議議决應在本月十日以前因該會俟各業代表推齊後尙有種種應行預備之手續遲恐不及也云云</p>

<p>張伯苓歸途之談話　　（本報特派記者錢華記）</p>
<p>中國選手隊總代表張伯苓氏素以熱心體育著稱記者此次與張同輪來滬曾作數次長時間之談話對於此後促進中國體育之方法討論甚詳蓋非全國人民之奮起與覺悟及政府之提倡中國之體育前途終未易樂觀不特四年後之今日决無勝利之望遠東席上且將終無我國之一席地也此次失敗剌激最足使吾人醒悟亟求補救時猶非晚張氏之言曰</p>
<h3 id="c176">日本進步可畏 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>此次赴日後感想極多對日本百事之進步殊令人可欽可畏體育其一端也田經賽游泳已足與世界各國相抗衡即以足球籃球而論三年前之今日實力相去不啻天淵此種奮鬥不懈之精神實足爲吾人取法</p>
<p>總代表張伯苓返滬後之影　　（孫道勝攝）</p>
<p>茲後裁判問題　此次大會中對於裁判員之缺少經騐多少有褊袒之處殊令人不快關於此點我國代表曾於三國代表會議時提出請各國注意詩論結果議决下届大會舉行時裁判員應先徵求其他二國同意但因此條有關日本體面問題在大會紀錄上並未載明得三國同意諒解而止</p>
<p>根本救濟辦法　張氏又謂關於根本補救中國體育不振辦法體育恊進會曾於五日晨在龍田丸船中開會討論議决治本與治標兩種辦法治本辦法即正式向教育部建議自小學迄大學增加體育必修課再由適宜指導員負責指導分門别類以漸進的方法從事績習但此非短期内所能奏效也</p>
<p>南北分區練習　至治標辦法是日所議决者（一）足球以港滬兩隊爲中心從事訓練並於短期内資遺至歐洲比賽以增長其經騐（二）排球責成港粤兩隊繼續練習聘請優良教練以最新科學方法力求進步（三）籃球以天津北平爲中心從事訓練且時時作分區比賽以售劵所得充兩隊旅費（四）經賽全國同時努力在各學校中訓練設法多建運動埸游泳及棒球爲我國最幼稚最因難之運動建造最新式之五十米游泳耗欵極巨但體恊會仍當努力設法以謀進步至各種運動練習暫以明年全國運動會爲目標庶能格外奮後</p>
<p>改組體育恊會　有人曾提議改組體恊會組織强有力之體育中心機關余亦深覺體恊之不完全體恊原分東南中西北五區以華北較有歷史較有團結但余深信體恊要有一個中心勢力可以支配全國而地點亦以上海爲最適宜苟無上海機關第七届即不能赴馬尼剌參加大會第八届即不能在上海舉行本届即不能成行且前届中國體育事業均由外人主持自第七届後迄今完全由華人自主不得謂不進步諸事均要逐漸進步操之過急反易生阻力故余主張應暫維持現狀俟明年全國運勤會時乘便召集全國體育家討論完善之改組又有主張體恊會亦以省市單位者恐更難召集全國　殊非計之得也</p>
<p>南開學校體育　張氏旋謂此次受感觸極深返津後即當以南開學校爲模範　開始進行體育訓綀自小學迄大學以體育爲必修課</p>
<p>聘請良好教綀分門訓綀並擬建築大中學籃球房各一座以明年全國運動會爲自標保持天津籃球隊之名舉進一步言即增進全國籃球一分之力量也</p>

<p>佐藤首先開球連勝二盤自第三盤起林氏有甚好之表演在第三及第四盤中佐藤屢因開球殺球而失點直至林氏以四對二佔優勝時佐藤方見轉機遂一鼓作氣連赢四盤成六對四之比而獲得第一局</p>
<p>第二局開始佐藤仍佔優勢第一盤林氏先勝二</p>
<p>球後连輸四點第二盤林氏僅得一球第三盤中佐藤有極强而準之押球第四盤林氏獲二球第五盤林氏全敗第六盤林氏獲一球遂以六對○敗北在最後二盤中林氏大有難支之勢一任佐藤抽打而莫能還擊</p>

<p>第三局中林氏奮鬭至力在初二盤中大有挽回戰局之勢佐藤僅各獲一球林氏每將球抽送至敵場後部使佐藤挽救無法誠不愧有名選手惟自第三盤起局勢又轉惡第三四盤中林氏回救高球姿態極佳傅得全塲之讚許第五盤佐藤有極多强烈之抽球第六盤林氏開球猛烈異常惜均被佐藤擊回在最後第八盤時林氏攻守得宜屢成和局終以佐藤高跳抽打擊回一球未及防備而失敗結果爲六對二</p>

<p>布井開球後兩方各勝一盤繼續布又連勝三盤成四與一之比此時邱氏以極準磪而低遠之抽球應敵頗若成効在六盤中獲勝五點以六對五居先以後二盤又以一時不愼敗北但邱氏以經騐豐富雖居七對六不利之地位仍能振作精神得二盤之勝利最後邱氏少現疲乏不能多多奔馳終以八對十敗於布井矣</p>
<p>第二局布氏開球後赢一盤以後各互勝二對二但布氏勇往直前連得三球邱氏亦不示弱得勝第八盤最後布氏以角球再勝一盤遂以六對三得赢一局</p>
<p>第三局開始邱氏應戰益猛急思挽回殘局抽球頗多奏効但已疲乏故雖極力奔馳亦常未能還擊敵方來球第一盤經兩次之和球後方輸去第二盤又成和球正努力抵抗來球之際忽爾因腿部抽筋倒地並表示十二分痛苦狀况經醫士藥治後仍不能行動遂宣告棄權以便休息後明日再作對日雙打云</p>
<p>邱氏表演極好抽球極爲穏準而迅速使敵人無</p>

<p>斅厂</p>
<p>摯友李君子華旅俄有年此次歸國爲述俄人之性質甚詳茲錄其一二以介紹於我國人</p>
<p>俄人文學之特色則真率是也若以小說與英人較其尤著矣英之小說家以表白其一已之意見發散其鬱勃之精神者也雖綴之以美文而著者靈魂之真相蓋未曾現俄人則不然放矌而真率且不惟傾作者之真情而活現之即其描寫社會人物之真相亦出之以忠實蓋於是中可知其精力及心情可見其天性及誠意真率之所在並可得其强弱點試一讀俄國名作者之小說則其顯者農民罪人狂夫之真相皆於是乎現有謀社會改造者有反對者有冷視者有崇拜東洋者有熱心西洋者有尊敬已國者雖紛然雜然而皆出之真實蓋俄人文學之性質實與英吉利婦人之文學相似</p>
<p>俄人之小說又有一特色在則寫人情是也無論若何之佳作苟非寫人情者則不能見重於社會俄人所崇拜者人情也慘酷可也卑猥可也獰猛可也可憐亦可也而惟以能表顯人情者爲最佳故俄之小說家貴人情於法律宗教道德聖人之心事姦婦之心情狂夫之心狀則皆摹其真而汲汲從事者也</p>
<p>俄人有女性前僅以文學言之耳其實於種種方面皆得發見之夫感情勃然而起則真欲實行之實行之而不得則一變而成陰鬱症此女子之通性而亦俄人之通性也按俄人之大科學家多婦人大文學家多婦人乃至政治上宗教上黨會上等等之運動亦莫不多婦人蓋俄人之性質實近女性云</p>

<p>（狗底跳舞）的劇名的來源是因爲那劇中主人公翟漢禮他是個性情很落漠而没有閒情别致的人他家内所以有音樂的設備是因爲他的未婚妻是個擅長音樂者的緣故他自已是不大懂音樂的不過他小的時候他的母親曾教他一個簡單的調子呌（狗底跳舞）直到他長大了的時候還没忘記他高興的時候他彈了給他的愛人和他的朋友們聽的雖然他的指法很笨他頽廢的時候彈了給他的狎客聽他傷心的時候絶望而自殺的時候彈了給他自已聽劇中彈至四五遍之多所以作者就把那個調子象徵那全劇的憂鬱和沈悶的</p>
<p>安特列夫的哲學是灰色的而且富於神秘性的那（狗底跳舞）當然也是如此所以去年的觀衆中有好多人是看完了全劇還不明瞭牠的劇旨我個人的解釋是那劇是象徵着俄國大戰前的混亂時代的鬱悶的情緒的那劇中主人公由失望而挣扎而絶望便是全劇的經過翟漢禮那句口頭禪（門自已會關的）不是明明在指着（人總是要死的）或）什么都結果是空的）嗎他又說（我曾經生活生活）而（種種的已往都是有的種種的已往可都是空的）這正是安特列夫的絶望的哲學劇本内又說「没有生出來的是誰呢不曾看見光明的是誰呢」他是怎樣的懹弔着他的後代的子孫和眷念着人類將來的光明的遙遙無期呀（太陽要七點鐘升起來這花花的黑夜教我怎樣過呢）翟漢禮等不到明天的光明了就是安特列夫等不到將來的光明了怎樣傷心的作家呀這劇本經辛酉劇圑排演而况導演者又就是譯者當然對於劇本的藴意發揮無遺他們的演出術是海上劇壇首屈一指的我最喜歡的是他們製造很偉大的布景台上雖然安置着幾件大道具還覺得很寥落當那翟漢禮内心交戰着生與死的二念而在台上跳着發狂的時候就見出他這人竟渺小的像虫蟻黯淡得像鬼影造出一種悽慘的空氣使觀衆都感覺得他真是活不下去了加以演那翟漢禮一角的袁牧之君的表演的精到把翟漢禮的深刻的内後完全刻畫出來把可以用五六十萬言寫的翟漢禮的歷史全部在四幕劇裏裏暗示出來這是很值得恭維的</p>
<p>在竸尙低級趣味的劇界辛酉劇團這次的難劇運動確乎是難能而可貴的吧</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e4">Recent World News <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The recent news from various countries can be summarized into several points: first, the decline of commerce; second, the revolutions in colonies; third, the relief of the unemployed; and fourth, contraction policies such as government reduction, layoffs, and production cuts. Taken together, more aspects belong to the negative side and fewer to the positive side. Therefore, speaking of the world as a whole, it is currently in a period of retreat rather than progress.</p>
<p>The process of world evolution is originally not a straightforward advance, but progresses in twists and turns between tension and relaxation. Since the 19th century, rapid progress has been made, and the development of all undertakings has flourished to this day, and there is a tendency to hover, which is naturally the way things are. According to my observation, if the existing world organization and psychology cannot be fundamentally changed, then this situation of decline and retreat cannot be restored. For the time being, let us not discuss whether the so-called fundamental change comes from the individual repentance of the majority and is obtained in peace, or whether it is obtained after great chaos through struggling and following the old path until there is no other way. Although the ways of obtaining it are not the same, if the world wants to turn decline and retreat into prosperity and progress, it cannot succeed without this fundamental change.</p>
<p>As for the fact that in this period of decline and retreat, a temporary appearance of prosperity may be presented due to some kind of remedy, or a temporary view of progress may be present in a certain place due to special circumstances, this is not for the whole of the world and ultimately speaking, and is not enough to generalize the general trend of the world from now on.</p>

The first on the list is Count Ciano, the Minister of Communications, who is related to Mussolini through his children. The Fascist Party has decided that Mussolini will retain the position of Head of Government after his retirement, with the intention of continuing the dictatorial system. The power to retain or remove the Head of Government rests with the Italian King and cannot be influenced by the Parliament.</p>

<p>Mexico City to Host an International Conference</p>
<p>To Study Ways to Improve the Silver Market Situation</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: Conservative MP Mr. Lansborough-Samuels asked the government in the House of Commons today to pay attention to the decline in silver prices, stating that the economic situation in some parts of the British Empire has been adversely affected. He asked whether the Colonial Office plans to place Hong Kong on the gold standard and provide temporary assistance to civil servants who are paid in silver. The Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies replied that the Colonial Office is paying close attention to this matter and that the Currency Investigation Committee appointed by the Governor of Hong Kong may provide valuable information for the Colonial Office to consider. However, it must be noted that Hong Kong civil servants have already been granted increased remuneration.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 5th: Although the silver market situation remains volatile, it appears that American silver producers will not actively participate in any plans to stabilize the silver market. According to informed sources, silver is mostly a by-product. If silver production is to be regulated, the production of copper, lead, and other metals must also be restricted. The National Mining Congress, recently held in Mexico City, passed a resolution advocating the convening of representatives from all silver-producing countries in Mexico City in the coming months to study ways to improve the situation caused by the falling silver prices. The above suggestions have not attracted attention in New York, as people in New York believe that the most important step to restore the normal state of the world silver market is stability within China.</p>

<p>Plan to be Announced and Implemented Soon</p>
<p>All Mines Will Need to Close for Two Months</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th: It is reported that the special committee appointed by the Tin Producers' Association is currently considering a plan to cut annual production by 20% in the short term. If this plan is implemented, tin mines around the world will be closed for two months. It is said that in order to be effective, this plan must be implemented immediately. A formal announcement is expected next week.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 5th: Representatives from tin mines managed from Sydney in Malaya and Siam advocate that tin mines should temporarily suspend production for three months. Most of the mine owners in Perak believe that the large tin mines operated by Europeans and Chinese in Malaya should be closed for two months, but the small-scale Chinese tin mines should continue to operate because these mines employ a total of 30,000 miners. This policy can prevent these workers from losing their jobs and avoid causing a serious situation in the Kinta Valley. It is reported that the international committee of the Tin Producers' Association may agree with this proposal. According to reliable sources, if the price of tin does not rise, most of the Chinese tin mines in Perak will go bankrupt by the end of July. Some people advocate that the Straits Settlements should ban Chinese immigrants from entering the country.</p>

<p>Likely to be Vetoed by President Hoover</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 5th: According to speculation today from a group of veteran political observers, the Tariff Bill, even if approved by both the House and Senate, may still be vetoed by President Hoover. In the past twenty-four hours, the White House has repeatedly told reporters that President Hoover has a liberal attitude towards the Tariff Bill and intends to carefully consider it before making a decision. According to previous trends, it was widely believed that Hoover would approve the Tariff Bill. However, this intriguing statement recently suggests that Hoover has been swayed by protests from various agricultural states and opposition from other parties and has changed his original intention. Furthermore, the most important opponent of the Tariff Bill, automobile magnate Mr. Ford, recently stayed at the White House. This suggests that Ford may have influenced Hoover's sudden change in attitude.</p>

<p>Each Province Expresses Opposition</p>
<p>Den Tsaun Agency, Tokyo, 6th: Based on the austerity policy of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, the Ministry of Finance drafted yesterday a basic plan for reducing the expenses of various government offices. The contents include 12 million yen for the Ministry of Finance, 11.5 million yen for the Navy, 11 million yen for the Ministry of Communications, and 8.2 million yen for the Army. Although excluding the special accounts of the Ministry of Railways, the total still reaches 58.4 million yen. However, each province has expressed opposition to this austerity plan. The most difficult case is the Ministry of the Army because the investigation and research on military system reform is nearing completion, and the drafting of concrete plans for reorganization and other matters is underway. The sudden imposition of this major austerity plan is like a bolt from the blue. The military is greatly surprised that the cabinet changed the budget within three weeks of the parliament adjourning without further deliberation. Therefore, they strongly oppose this. The Minister of the Army, Utagaki, is in a difficult position. However, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are firmly committed to administrative reform and are determined to suppress the dissenting opinions of each province. The Reformation Committee expressed its determination to implement the plan.</p>
<p>Japanese News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: The Ministry of Finance has delivered the original plan for economizing administrative affairs to the accounting authorities of each province and has scheduled negotiations to begin this week. It is expected to be implemented in mid-month.</p>

<p>Hankou Correspondence: Zhang Guijun fled from Guangxi to Hunan. Fourth Route Army Commander He Jian has not only deployed heavy troops in key areas for strict defense and is awaiting an opportunity to attack, but also his Eighth Route Army and Sixth Route Army will surround and attack with the Wuhan forces on all sides. I paid a special visit to Garrison Commander He Yingqin today to inquire about the situation. Mr. He's remarks were as follows: (I asked) I heard that Zhang Guijun's troops have fled into southern Hunan. I don't know where they are now or how many troops they have. (He replied) According to reports from the front lines, they were met with a head-on attack by our Fourth Route Army in the Liling Zhuzhou area yesterday. The rebel troops seem to have more than 10,000 men, but they are all exhausted. After yesterday's fierce attack, the number of dead and wounded has been greatly reduced. (I asked) There are rumors that Chairman He plans to wait until the enemy advances into the interior before launching a fierce attack. I don't know if this is true. (He replied) The rebel army is attempting to make a show of force and is advancing rapidly. Chairman He may have thought that the troops were scattered and could not be assembled quickly. Therefore, he plans to quickly gather all his forces, select a position, and lure the enemy deep to facilitate encirclement and annihilation. This is a common strategy in warfare. (I asked) The remarks you made the other day mentioned that the large army was going to Hunan. I don't know where they are now. (He replied) It is inconvenient to disclose the position of the troops, but what I can say is that the three divisions of Guangdong troops going to Hunan are closely following the rebels, no more than four or five days away. In addition, there are tens of thousands of Central Army troops preparing to meet the attack. With such forces against an isolated army that has advanced deep into the territory, its annihilation can be predicted. We have now made proper arrangements and are waiting for them to come so that we can wipe them out in the predetermined location. (June 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e62">Jiangsu Province Rice Stem Borer Control Propaganda Campaign <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>

<p>The Ministry of Agriculture and Mining of Jiangsu Province considers the stem borer problem in the 20 counties including Songjiang to be the most serious in Jiangsu Province. The annual loss of agricultural crop value is about tens of millions of yuan. Last year's survey of each county showed that the stem borer damage destroyed more than 7.14 million dan of brown rice. If it is not eradicated on a large scale, it will inevitably spread.

<h3 id="e63">Zhejiang Province to Build More Shortwave Radio Stations <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Department of Construction Has Already Started</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that the current situation is turbulent, and after the disaster last year, bandit alarms are frequent in the counties on the provincial border. To ensure the security of Zhejiang Province, it relies on the close defense of the military and militia, and even more so on the timely communication and rapid delivery of information from all over the area, so that they can respond quickly. The Provincial Government Committee meeting has decided to establish ten shortwave radio stations in two phases in the provincial capital and in remote counties such as Pingyang, Taishun, Qingyuan, Changshan, Longquan, Jingning, Qingtian, Suian, and Tiantai. The Department of Construction has already started the first phase of installation and telegraphed the magistrates of Pingyang, Taishun, Qingyuan, and Changshan four days ago to quickly find suitable houses so that personnel can be sent to the counties to install them. Yesterday, it also sent telegraph operators Wu Chengteng, Shen Chutong, Dong Xiu, Gong Naihong, Li Xin, Kang Zhang Yuzhuo, and Gong Fengxuan, two to each county, to carry machines to various counties for installation, and ordered the county to take care of the operators when they arrive.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Wei Lihuang Takes Responsibility for Rural Pacification in Northern Anhui <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Announcing the Appointment of Multiple Special Commissioners for Rural Pacification</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The counties in northern Anhui have long been known as bandit areas. It is difficult to eradicate them completely because they are constantly being suppressed and fleeing. Wei Lihuang, the acting commander of the 45th Division of the Army, has made great efforts to suppress bandits since he took office as the Garrison Commander of Northern Anhui. However, they have not yet been completely eradicated. Commander-in-Chief Chiang believed that it was necessary to implement rural pacification during this military period, so he specially appointed Mr. Wei last month as the Commander of Rural Pacification in Northern Anhui and the Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Anhui Militia. After accepting the appointment, Mr. Wei announced his assumption of office at the headquarters of the division in Furen Lane, Bengbu, and established the Headquarters of Rural Pacification in Northern Anhui and the Headquarters of the Northern Anhui Militia to handle rural pacification matters in accordance with the Rural Pacification Regulations promulgated by the Central Government. Seven Special Commissioners for Rural Pacification were first announced in the nearby counties to be responsible for carrying out the work. Ni Rongxian was appointed as the Special Commissioner for Rural Pacification in Huaiyuan, Mengcheng, and Fengtai. Wang Shaojiu was appointed as the Assistant Special Commissioner for Rural Pacification in Huaiyuan, Mengcheng, and Fengtai. Zhang Weixin was appointed as the Special Commissioner for Taihe. Cheng Yi was appointed as the Special Commissioner for Shouxian. Chen Changqi was appointed as the Special Commissioner for Yingshang. Zhu Runzhang was appointed as the Special Commissioner for Hefei. Xu Yafu was appointed as the Special Commissioner for Suxian. Xu Renfeng was appointed as the Special Commissioner for Dingyuan. Other counties will also be announced one after another. After accepting the appointment, the Special Commissioners have gone to various counties to start the work. Mr. Wei also sent his Chief of Staff, Shen Guojun, to the counties to inspect the local situation and convened a rural pacification meeting to discuss the implementation plan. Concrete measures have been discussed on matters such as checking household registration, suppressing bandits, replenishing guns and ammunition, and joint defense and patrols. It will begin soon.

<h3 id="e65">Kidnapping and Murder Case Occurs in Bengbu <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Bandits Kidnap a Four-Year-Old Child</p>
<p>And Shoot and Kill His Parents</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Chang Tinggui, a kiln owner from Caozhou, Shandong Province, has been in the brick and tile business in Bengbu Hexia for several years and has a well-to-do family. Therefore, he was coveted by bandits. Chang is 42 years old, and his wife, Ren, is also from the same province. They have a son named Yatou, who is only four years old, and an adopted son named Xiao Cheng, who is seven years old. Chang has a cousin named Chang Congqi, a retired non-commissioned officer who helps Chang. On the evening of the 3rd of this month, at about 9:00 p.m., seven bandits suddenly came, carrying a pistol and a box of guns. Four bandits stood guard outside, and three bandits broke into Chang Congqi's residence. The bandits suddenly grabbed Chang, who was skilled in martial arts and very strong. Chang knocked down two bandits with two punches. One bandit pointed a pistol at his chest and ordered him to be quiet. Chang dared not move. At that time, Chang Tinggui's wife, Chang Ren, happened to come out of the toilet. Seeing the bandits, she hurriedly wanted to enter the room to grab her beloved son, Yatou. The four bandits on guard quickly stepped forward and pushed Chang Ren to the ground. Chang Ren shouted for help. One bandit shot Chang Ren with a gun. The bullet entered through her breast and exited from her lower back. She died instantly. The bandits then took Yatou out. When his father, Tinggui, saw this, he stepped forward to snatch him back. The bandits held on tightly and would not let go. Yatou cried incessantly. Tinggui could not bear to let go. The bandits angrily shot him in the head with a box of gun. Tinggui was in extreme pain and fell to the ground, lamenting, "Okay, you can take him away." He also died soon after. The bandits carried Yatou out the door and fled east. Chang Congqi immediately went out to secretly follow the bandits, but he returned home dejectedly after seeing that the rain was too heavy. He saw Tinggui and his wife lying stiff in a pool of blood, long dead. He hurried to the First Public Security Bureau to report the incident. The bureau immediately sent people to investigate and reported it to the Public Security Bureau. This morning (4th) at 6:00 a.m., the Public Security Bureau sent judicial officers to conduct a re-examination and ordered the investigators and teams of each bureau to arrest the bandits. It is unknown whether they will be able to solve the case. (June 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Merger of the Jinan City and County Party Headquarters <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Since Jinan was designated as a special district, numerous disputes have arisen with Licheng County in recent months due to boundary issues. The city side argued that the area within twenty li of Jinan City should be the city district and sought to eliminate the county's sub-district headquarters within the city. The county side, on the other hand, insisted that the city district should be limited to the city gates and the commercial port, requesting the removal of the city's sub-district headquarters within the county area.</p>
<p>As this issue remained unresolved for a long time, conflicts frequently occurred regarding the powers of the city and county party headquarters, and numerous disputes also arose concerning the affiliation of party members. The Shandong Provincial Party Headquarters, considering that the division of administrative areas between the city and county resulted in Licheng County having only a few dozen party members, making management and guidance difficult, initially planned to merge the Licheng County Party Headquarters into the Jinan City Party Headquarters. However, after the provincial organization department submitted a request for instructions to the central government, it received a directive stating that county-level party organizations were of significant importance, and Licheng was the leading county in the province, so it was appropriate to merge the Jinan City Party Headquarters into the county party headquarters.</p>
<p>After receiving the directive, the provincial organization department presented the merger proposal at its 73rd meeting on the 29th, which was approved. Preparations for the merger were immediately initiated. It was noted that in Zhejiang, the Hangzhou City Party Headquarters had been merged into the Hang County Party Headquarters, and the Ningbo City Party Headquarters into the Yin County Party Headquarters. There was no precedent for a separate city party headquarters. In August of the previous year, during the Third Central Financial Conference, it was already proposed to merge the Jinan City Party Headquarters into the Licheng County Party Headquarters to save expenses. At that time, the Shandong Provincial Party Headquarters argued that Jinan City was the intersection of the Jiaoji and Jinpu Railways, a center of politics, economy, and transportation, with 300 party members (now 800). It submitted a report to the central government arguing that it was necessary to establish a party headquarters in Jinan City. However, recently, due to boundary disputes and party affairs conflicts, the central government again ordered the merger of the Jinan City Party Headquarters into the Licheng County Party Headquarters. From this point forward, the city and county party affairs disputes should come to an end. The following is a record of the correspondence related to this case:</p>
<p>Telegram from the Central Organization Department to the Shandong Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee: Regarding the case, the Central Secretariat has approved the letter from the Third Central Financial Conference stating that Jinan City falls under the jurisdiction of Licheng County, and its party affairs can be handled by the county party headquarters to save provincial expenses. Please review and reply, etc. Accordingly, investigate whether Jinan City's party affairs are essential and whether there are any inconveniences in merging it into the Licheng County Party Headquarters. Submit your opinions for review. Central Organization Department, Xian.</p>
<p>Report from the Provincial Organization Department: We have investigated that Licheng was originally the leading county in Shandong Province. After the situation in Shandong stabilized, the city and county were separated, and separate county and city party headquarters were established during the era of the former Provincial Steering Committee. This has continued until now. In August of the 18th year of the Republic of China, we received a telegram from your department, Xian, ordering the merger of the Jinan City Party Headquarters into the Licheng County Party Headquarters. Considering that it was practically impossible, we submitted a telegram in response and subsequently received a directive approving the exemption from the merger. However, based on the department's investigation over the past few months, it is indeed necessary to merge and reorganize the Jinan City and County Party Headquarters. Most of the party members belonging to Licheng County currently reside within the Jinan City area, leading to disputes over the division of sub-district headquarters and jurisdiction. As the city and county areas have not been clearly divided, the Licheng County Party Headquarters faces many obstacles in relocating to the countryside for office work. Since the county government and other county-level agencies are located within the Jinan City area, there is no need to have a separate county party headquarters. This is one reason. Licheng County currently has fewer than 40 party members. According to the sub-district headquarters division method, only three sub-district headquarters can be established, which is insufficient to establish a county party headquarters. The separate city and county structure is like a parasitic branch. This is the second reason. Furthermore, Jinan City has a large number of party members, heavy workloads, and is a transportation hub for the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways, serving as the political and economic center of Shandong Province. It faces financial difficulties. After the merger, it can receive the party fees from Licheng County to supplement its funding. This is the third reason. Considering the above reasons, after careful consideration by the department, we propose to immediately abolish the Licheng County Party Headquarters. All current county-level party members will be transferred to the Jinan City Party Headquarters, which will facilitate the progress of party affairs. The original county party headquarters' funds will be allocated to the city party headquarters for use. Whether or not this is in accordance with party principles, we have submitted a written report and request your review and approval.</p>
<p>Directive from the Central Organization Department: Having received the report, we have investigated that county-level organizations are an important part of the party organization system, and Licheng is the leading county in the province. It is appropriate to merge the Jinan City Party Headquarters into the county party headquarters. Otherwise, the county party headquarters should be reorganized as a district party headquarters or sub-district headquarters directly under the province. Please comply accordingly and report the handling situation.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Rampant Plague and Pestilence in Shaanxi Province <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Report by Mr. Baker of the China International Famine Relief Commission</p>
<p>And Suggestions for Implementing Road Construction to Alleviate the Shaanxi Disaster</p>
<p>Ping Dispatch: Mr. Baker, the Relief Director of the China International Famine Relief Commission, who went to Shaanxi to investigate the disaster, arrived in Xi'an in early May. According to a recent report from Xi'an, the first special train used by the commission, carrying over 300 tons of relief grain to Shaanxi, began arriving in the disaster areas on May 10th. The grain is currently being distributed to 22 of the 30 counties most severely affected by the disaster. All of the Shaanxi relief grain transported by the commission is intended to be unloaded in Weinan and then transported to the disaster areas by handcart. Therefore, in these few weeks, handcart transportation within the province has been very busy. It is reported that the commission has transported a total of 1,625 tons of relief grain to Shaanxi from Fengtai, and another 560 tons are stored in Shijiazhuang awaiting shipment.</p>
<p>Once all the grain has been transported to Lingbao, the two relief grain special trains will be returned to the relevant authorities. In the future, if more relief grain is to be transported, it will be purchased locally for simplicity. Relief in Gansu has already been handled in this manner. Currently, the most complex issue in the disaster relief efforts in Shaanxi and Gansu is the rampant plague and pestilence following the major disaster. Mr. Baker also reported that residents in Shaanxi Province are consuming scallions and garlic due to the prevalence of plague and pestilence to prevent infection. Furthermore, Mr. An Xianjin, the director of relief efforts in Gansu, reported that Ms. Jia, a local member involved in relief work in Huixian County, recently died from the plague. It is hoped that other relief workers will be spared infection and that the situation from last year will not recur, as quite a few relief workers died from the plague last year. Mr. Baker also reported that when he passed through Tongguan, he saw 140 tons of relief grain allocated by the commission to Shaanxi disaster relief shelters being transported upstream by waterway. It has already reached its destination, and the remaining 200 tons will arrive soon. Mr. Baker also suggested that road construction is the most suitable form of work relief in Shaanxi. The routes are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Build a road southeast from Xi'an through the mountains to reach the bank of the Han River. Once completed, traffic between Xi'an and Hankou will be restored, and commercial transport will be facilitated. (2) Build a road north from Xi'an through the mountains, passing through important cities to reach the oil-producing areas. If the above two road projects can be realized, not only will the commercial revitalization of Shaanxi Province be promising, but also transport will be facilitated and various laborers will be able to make a living. Both politics and the economy will benefit from this. As for irrigation works, due to the large scale of the project and the time required for preparation and coordination, it is advisable to handle it later. (May 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Shanxi High Court's Arbitrary Arrest of Journalist <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: Tian Ruyi, the President of the Shanxi High Court, illegally and arbitrarily arrested Zhang Yinxuan, the editor of the Min Hua Bao (People's Voice Newspaper). All sectors are fiercely opposing Tian Ruyi as a result. In addition to sending letters, telegrams, declarations, and exposing Tian Ruyi's crimes, they have also submitted petitions to the provincial government and the Political Inspection Committee, requesting that Tian be severely punished according to the law for his illegal actions. The resident journalists' associations in Pingjin and Shanghai have also sent letters to the Political Inspection Committee and the local court, urging them to swiftly handle Tian's case according to the law. The local court replied to the journalists' association the day before yesterday, stating that the court only knows the law and nothing else, and that the case is under investigation. However, yesterday, the local court suddenly announced that Zhang Yinxuan had no criminal record and had been granted a dismissal, releasing Zhang Yinxuan. All sectors are even more opposed to the High Court's arbitrary arrest and release, trampling on human rights. The Min Hua Bao, the party involved, has already submitted a petition to the authorities, advocating for justice and severely punishing Tian Ruyi. The local court's reply to the journalists' association, the local court's letter to the Min Hua Bao, the dismissal order, and the Min Hua Bao's petition are recorded below:</p>
<p>Local Court's Letter to the Journalists' Association: In response to your letter, we have received and acknowledge it. It is noted that the Min Hua Bao recently published a news item about the High Court. The High Court ordered the immediate suspension of our court clerk, Zhang Qingyue, who was serving as an editor at the newspaper. The case is currently under investigation. Our court, responsible for judgment, only knows the law and nothing else. If the prosecutor brings a public prosecution against anyone for a crime, our court will handle it in accordance with the law, impartially. We are responding to your letter and hope you will take note.</p>
<p>Local Court's Letter to the Min Hua Bao: Sir, we have investigated the crime of obstructing official duties by your newspaper's editor, Zhang Yinxuan, and determined that there is no suspicion of a crime. A dismissal order has been issued and served. Please entrust Zhang Qingyue to your newspaper and request that he reside in your newspaper during the seven-day period for reconsideration, and do not allow him to leave so he may be summoned. We hope to hear back from you.</p>
<p>Dismissal Order: Defendant Zhang Qingyue, also known as Zhang Yinxuan, regarding case number 19 of the Republic of China for obstructing official duties, the investigation has been completed. This office believes that a dismissal should be issued. The facts and reasons are described below: On the tenth of this month, a letter from the president of the same court was received, stating, "Sir, pursuant to a secret order from the Shanxi High Court, the Min Hua Daily published an article today entitled 'The Shanxi High Court's Squandering of Public Funds and Neglect of Duty', which openly insults the agency and constitutes a criminal offense. The editor should be held responsible. It has been determined that the editor of the newspaper, Zhang Yinxuan, is Zhang Qingyue, who is currently a clerk in this court. In addition to ordering the prosecution of the clerk by the court's prosecutor's office, the court president is hereby ordered to immediately suspend Zhang Qingyue and transfer him to the court's prosecutor's office for investigation." Upon receiving this order, in addition to temporarily suspending the clerk, the clerk was sent to your office for investigation. Prosecutor Zhou Shiding and Su Xiangxian were ordered to conduct a thorough secret investigation and open a court hearing. According to Zhang Qingyue's statement, "I serve as an editor at the Min Hua Daily, responsible for international and domestic news. This article was in the local news section. I am not responsible for local news. I am not the contributor, the editor, or the editor-in-chief. I did not know about this article and therefore bear no criminal responsibility." Prosecutors Zhou Shiding and Su Xiangxian subsequently reported that the original article entitled "The Shanxi High Court's Squandering of Public Funds and Neglect of Duty" was published in the Min Hua Daily on the 17th of this month. The article was submitted by a reporter. Zhang Yinxuan, also known as Zhang Qingyue, is responsible for international and domestic news at the Min Hua Daily and is not responsible for local news. The Min Hua Daily also sent a letter stating, "The article entitled 'The Shanxi High Court's Squandering of Public Funds and Neglect of Duty' published in our newspaper on the 17th of this month was submitted by a reporter and published by a local news editor. Zhang Yinxuan is the international news editor of our newspaper and is not responsible for editing local news. He is not our newspaper's chief writer or manager. Whether the article insults the agency or not is a separate matter, but it is clear that Zhang Yinxuan should not bear any responsibility." Based on the aforementioned statements and evidence, the newspaper's published news articles are assigned to different editors. Zhang Qingyue is responsible for international and domestic news. He is not the contributor, editor, or editor-in-chief of this news article. Therefore, he should not bear any legal responsibility. The defendant, Zhang Qingyue, is clearly not suspected of committing a crime. In accordance with Article 244, Section 1, and Article 246 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a dismissal is hereby issued. Chief Prosecutor Zhang Bingqian.</p>
<p>Min Hua Bao's Petition to the Authorities: A petition is hereby submitted stating that Tian Ruyi, the President of the Shanxi High Court, has abused his power and illegally arrested Zhang Yinxuan, requesting that he be dismissed and brought to justice to uphold justice and enforce the law. On the 17th of this month, our newspaper published an article entitled "The Shanxi High Court's Squandering of Public Funds and Neglect of Duty" in the local news section (the original report is attached). Unexpectedly, at 12:00 pm today, bailiffs suddenly broke into our newspaper's office and told Zhang Yinxuan, the international news editor, that the president of the local court requested his presence for a matter. The editor was forced to go to the court, where President Li Ruhan stated that he had received a secret order from Tian Ruyi, the President of the High Court, stating that the Min Hua Bao published an article today entitled "The Shanxi High Court's Squandering of Public Funds and Neglect of Duty", which openly insults the agency and that the editor, Zhang Yinxuan, should bear criminal responsibility. The editor, Zhang Yinxuan, was then detained for 18 days and transferred to the prosecutor's office. The article entitled "The Shanxi High Court's Squandering of Public Funds and Neglect of Duty" published by our newspaper was submitted by a responsible reporter. The facts are true and there are records available. Our newspaper reported the matter truthfully. How can it be accused of openly insulting the agency and arrested? If reporting the matter truthfully is a violation of criminal law, then all newspapers in the world are law-breaking and all reporters can be arrested. Even if public documents and records are all fabricated, the newspaper's editor must be falsely accused of a crime. However, the arrest must be carried out by the appropriate authorities to be legal. The newspaper has a manager responsible for external affairs, and the editors are assigned to different departments. How can the international news editor, Zhang Yinxuan, be arrested for local news that is completely unrelated to him? It is like arresting anyone from a certain province to atone for a criminal who has not been arrested, only knowing that he is from that province. There is no such law in the world. Such reliance on power and arbitrary actions treats the law like a shoe. What justice can be spoken of? Since the judicial officer is so tyrannical, our newspaper has no way to seek redress. After much consideration, we have no choice but to state the facts and explain the original situation. We sincerely request that your ministry/government uphold justice, protect human rights, and immediately dismiss and bring to justice Tian Ruyi, the President of the Shanxi High Court, for abusing his power and illegally arresting Zhang Yinxuan, in order to uphold justice and enforce the law.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Shenyang to Periodically Burn Confiscated Narcotics <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The Liaoning Provincial Government issued a circular yesterday (29th) stating: "In accordance with the report from Fu Shuangying, the Superintendent of the Shenyang Customs, regarding the letter from the Shenyang Tax Office, which stated that the Liaoning Postal Director had reported receiving 239 registered letters from Hamburg, Germany, addressed to Fmine, a Japanese merchant in Changchun, which were suspected of containing illicit substances. One package was sent to Shanhaiguan for inspection. Shanhaiguan sent a portion of the package's contents to Jianghaiguan for chemical analysis, which confirmed that it contained heroin. Therefore, the Shanhaiguan Tax Office sent a letter to this Tax Office, which forwarded it to the Postal Director, who reported it to the Director-General of Posts. The Director-General of Posts ordered the Customs to handle the matter. The Postal Director forwarded the letter to the Customs, and this Tax Office immediately reported it to the Inspector-General of Customs. Instructions were received from the Inspector-General of Customs to have the Customs Superintendent and this Superintendent investigate and handle everything.</p>
<p>It is noted that these letters have been detained by the Post Office. This Tax Office intends to jointly inspect them with your esteemed Superintendent on a set date and to notify the addressees in advance to be present when the packages are opened. It is also necessary to re-inspect several packages of these letters, seal them tightly, and send them to Jianghaiguan for re-analysis. If they are found to be free of illicit substances, they should be burned together. All arrangements for the burning should be planned in advance to ensure that they are properly executed. Please reply with your opinion." Subsequently, the Tax Office sent another letter stating: "Recently, we received a letter from the Jianghaiguan Tax Office stating that five packages from the letters sent by your office to the Liaoning Post Office and detained and addressed to Japanese merchants in Changchun have been chemically analyzed and confirmed to contain prohibited narcotics. Therefore, these letters should be burned together. This Tax Office intends to consult with your esteemed Superintendent to set a date and location for the burning in order to make preparations." It is noted that a large number of registered letters from Germany were previously chemically analyzed by Shanhaiguan and found to contain heroin, and your government decided to burn them. The current batch of letters has been chemically analyzed by Jianghaiguan and confirmed to contain prohibited narcotics, so they should be handled in accordance with the previous case. However, as the matter is of great importance, this office is unable to make decisions unilaterally. Therefore, this report is submitted for your consideration and instructions on how to proceed." Accordingly, this report was presented at the 119th Provincial Committee Meeting, where it was resolved to handle it in accordance with the previous case and to consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest to the German and Japanese embassies. The Civil Affairs Department was instructed to consult with the relevant agencies and report back after handling the matter. It has now been reported that the committee convened the previous Heroin Burning Committee members and Mr. Lin, the Provincial Government Counselor, on the 19th of this month to discuss the date and method of the analysis and burning. The arrangements are listed below for your review. The proposed arrangements are consistent with the previous case arrangements and should be approved. In addition to the instructions being issued and circulated, the arrangements should be copied and sent for your reference and attendance at the scene. An additional copy of the arrangements is attached. (1) Analysis Date: June 6th, 2:00 PM. (2) Analysis Personnel: Director of the Chief Executive's Office Medical Department, Chemistry Teacher from Northeast University, Director of the Foreign Affairs Office, Chief Prosecutor of the High Court, Shenyang Customs Doctor, Doctor from the Post Office, Director-General of the Anti-Narcotics Association.

<h3 id="e70">Muling Coal Mine's Business Situation Last Year <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Net Profit Increased to 2.4 Million Yuan. Jilin Dispatch: The Sino-Russian joint venture Muling Coal Mine Company held its twelfth board meeting in Harbin on May 12 to report on the business situation for 1918 and discuss how to allocate profits. The Provincial Government sent Ma Deen, Director of the Agricultural and Mining Bureau, to attend. According to the report, the company sold a total of 311,165.048 tons of coal this year, earning a profit of 1,956,009.47 yuan. The Muling Railway earned a net profit of 435,412.78 yuan, for a total profit of 2,391,422.25 yuan. After deducting 15% of the coal sales as a public reserve fund and 20% of the railway's net profit for education and industry,</p>
<p>bonuses should be appropriately awarded to those who contributed to the work in accordance with the regulations. Although the extraction of bonuses is stipulated in the board's meeting rules, the amount varies. In 1917, 1.15% was extracted as bonuses for staff. Last year, the border defense was strained, and the mine was at the forefront of the conflict. All staff members worked diligently and selflessly day and night, making extraordinary contributions. It was agreed that 14% should be extracted as bonuses, as in previous years, with 12% distributed as follows: 4.61% to senior staff and 7.39% to all junior and middle-level staff. The Jilin Provincial Government should receive a total of 1,004,710 yuan from coal sales, railway net profit, and 30% for educational and industrial expenses. The Russian co-investors should receive a total of 799,587 yuan. A dividend of 300,000 yuan should be transferred to the province for verification and collection, and 100,000 yuan should be paid to the Yongheng Official Bank for transfer. A report should be submitted to the Provincial Government and letters sent to the Education and Agricultural and Mining Bureaus for verification. The remaining funds will be paid in installments in the second half of the year. The company's surplus in 1918 increased by over 400,000 yuan compared to 1917, mainly because the coal produced by the mine was able to be sold more easily due to the bombing of the Zha mine last year, resulting in higher profits.

<h3 id="e71">Korean Residents Destroyed the Andong Customs <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Andong Dispatch: In March of last year, the Andong Customs received instructions from the government to abolish the one-third land special tax on goods from Japan and to implement the new tariff regulations, under which all goods imported from Japan would be taxed according to the new tariff regulations. At that time, Japanese residents in Andong argued that the new tariff hindered trade with Japan and protested against it, but to no avail.</p>
<p>However, since then, some unscrupulous Japanese and Korean merchants have frequently secretly transported goods into Andong to evade customs duties for their own benefit. The Andong Customs has taken strict preventive measures and has uncovered numerous cases of tax evasion. Recently, another incident was discovered in which Korean residents evaded customs duties, gathered a crowd, rioted, and destroyed the customs office. The Andong Customs Commissioner has formally protested to the Japanese side. The events of the Korean residents' riot are as follows: Early in the morning of the 17th of this month, Korean merchants, including Park, secretly transported 17 boxes of rubber shoes worth approximately 18,000 Japanese yen from Sinuiju on the opposite shore by sailboat, hoping to evade customs duties. When they were transporting the rubber shoes to Liudaogou, just as they were about to land, a Customs officer patrolling the coast discovered them and rushed to the scene. He removed the rubber shoes from the boat. The Korean residents, unwilling to accept this, swarmed forward and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the Customs officer. The Korean residents were outnumbered and fled. The Customs officer confiscated all of the rubber shoes in accordance with the regulations. Around 7:00 PM that evening, the Korean residents gathered over 200 accomplices from Sinuiju, armed with guns and clubs, and surrounded and destroyed all the doors and windows of the coastal customs office. Several Customs officers suffered minor injuries. Fortunately, Chinese police arrived and dispersed the rioters, saving the Customs officers from further harm. Although the Japanese police heard about the riot of the Korean residents, they were slow to arrive, seemingly condoning the riot. Subsequently, the Andong Customs Commissioner protested to the Japanese side. The Japanese police station, unable to refuse, arrested three or five Korean residents who participated in the riot and detained them for questioning. On the third day, a Korean resident's body was suddenly discovered on the riverbank. Based on this, the Japanese side protested to the Andong Customs, strongly claiming that the deceased was killed by a Customs officer. The Customs side pointed out that there was clear evidence that the deceased had fallen into the river and drowned. The two sides are currently negotiating, each holding its own position. It is difficult to predict how it will end. (May 27th)</p>

<p>Thugs Using Water Police to Extort Money: On the 11th of last month, Zhou A'gen, a farmer from the sixth map of Shanyangxiang, was returning from Shanghai after selling cattle. When he reached the Wang Huzi Bridge in Jiangzhuangzhen, thugs Zhu A'zhao, Lu A'jin, and Guan, claiming to be water police detectives, seized Zhou, accusing him of selling illegal substances. Zhou insisted that he was a law-abiding citizen who would never do anything illegal. However, Song and others refused to listen and searched him thoroughly. As a result, they found 53 silver dollars and 130 copper coins. Besides these, there was nothing else. They returned 10 silver dollars and ordered him to leave. Zhou felt aggrieved because the remaining 40 silver dollars were the proceeds from selling the cattle, which he intended to use to pay rent. He argued with them, but Song and others became angry out of shame and dragged Zhou to Tinglin and turned him over to the third squadron of the water police headquarters. Gong, the squadron leader, did not investigate and tortured Zhou, forcing him to confess (it is rumored that Song A'zhao and others are Gong's disciples). Later, because there was no evidence, Zhou was released on the 14th. Zhou, who had been unjustly detained and whose cattle money had been taken away, filed a complaint with the 16th district sub-office. District Chief Xu sent a letter of inquiry and demanded the return of the confiscated silver dollars. After many days of negotiation, the original silver dollars were returned on the 22nd, but Song A'zhao and others are still at large. The local people are very indignant about this.</p>
<p>Robbery and Injury in Huangqiao Town: The home of Xu Yada in Miaobang, 23rd map of Huangqiao Town, 10th district of the county, was suddenly robbed by more than ten bandits on the evening of the 31st of last month. The bandits, armed with knives and sticks, looted the house and forced the owner to reveal the location of the hidden silver. When this failed, the bandits beat and injured Xu. Yesterday (6th), Xu came to Songjiang to report the incident to the county government and request an examination. The examination revealed that Xu had two wounds from wooden objects and one knife wound. Instructions were given to investigate and arrest the bandits and punish them.</p>

Yesterday (the 6th), the case was still heard by the local court. The trial opened at 2 p.m. Both parties appeared in person, and their respective defense lawyers Tang Shenfang and Zhu Fucheng appeared to defend them. After the trial opened, the judge announced an adjournment because the defendants Shi Ru, a monk, and Ma Shulan had not complied with the summons to appear in court. Shi Ru, a monk, and Ma Shulan must be brought to court, and the confession of Shi Ru, a monk, previously made to the West District Office of the Public Security Bureau, stating that he was ordered by Chief Li to persuade Cheng Peiyi to become a nun, must be retrieved before a new date for the trial is set.</p>
<p>Third Prison Uproar Continued: It was reported that at around 7 a.m. on the 5th, a riot of prisoners occurred in the third prison of Jiangsu on Siqian Street. Subsequently, thirty-three leading prisoners, including Du Junchen, were shackled and transferred to Nos. 4 and 18 in a ward. Yesterday (the 6th), Warden Lin and Chief Wang ordered the most important ones to be transferred to the third prison of Jiangsu in Xiaoliuzhen Lane, and the remaining accomplices were still imprisoned in the third prison. After the riot, each ward was sealed to prevent prisoners from moving freely outside the ward. Opening the seal required an order from the warden.</p>
<p>Woodworking Union Concerned About Domestic Goods: The Wuxian Woodworking Union recently experienced a strike, which has now subsided. Yesterday (the 6th), a meeting was held to propose: (1) Although the strike has ended, there are concerns that some employers may still deduct wages and disregard workers. It was resolved to send a letter to all employers stating that they must not deduct wages, maintain labor-management agreements, and persuade workers to be understanding and not to start disputes rashly. If an employer deducts wages, a report should be made to the union, and the union will negotiate with the employer based on reason. (2) Silk goods in this industry are sluggish and there are concerns that some employers may use this as an excuse to stop machines, which would affect the livelihoods of workers. It was resolved to send a letter to all employers stating that they must not use this as an excuse to stop machines in order to maintain the livelihood of workers. (3) The market is full of foreign goods, and silk goods in this industry have declined year after year. It was resolved to earnestly persuade all institutions and the public to use domestic goods to promote the industry.</p>
<p>County Government Approves Relocation: The county government is scheduled to relocate on the 15th of this month to the former site of the municipal government. Everything is currently being prepared. The Construction Bureau plans to reorganize streetlights. Because the streetlights in Wuxian are too dim and the installation is not entirely appropriate, the Wuxian Construction Bureau yesterday (the 6th) drafted measures to replace 40 to 200 streetlights. Roads that have been widened, such as Hulong Street and Jingde Road, will be equipped with streetlights in the center of the street, similar to Shanghai. The plan has been submitted to the county government for approval.</p>

<p>Land Survey of Roads in Mu: The land occupied by county roads in this county, from east to west, is approximately 52 li, with each li being approximately 9 mu and 9 fen, totaling more than 510 mu. Previously, former Director Wang proposed dividing the land into upper, middle, and lower grades, allocating a budget, and paying up to 60 yuan per mu, requiring a total of more than 31,000 yuan. The provincial government approved the decision to reimburse the amount over three years. However, it is now proposed to survey and allocate the grain tax on the road surface to each household, preparing for an exemption from payment during the upcoming spring tribute. Therefore, the current acting director, Zhou Jiuxu, has organized a surveying team to go to various places to survey and exempt the land according to the original land area, regardless of irregularities. The Finance Bureau has been requested to appoint a registrar to fill out the forms, with a deadline of the end of June.</p>
<p>Zhuanghang Joint Disaster Donation Report: The Zhuanghang joint disaster donation, including subsidies from both the provincial and national governments, totaled more than 40,000 yuan.

<p>Repeated Robberies Throughout the Town: Shenxiang Town, located 20 li from the county seat, is on the border between Songjiang and Qingpu. Songjiang County has not dispatched a police station, and Qingpu County lacks adequate defense. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 4th of this month, more than 40 bandits with two bandit ships and weapons looted the entire town, causing losses of several thousand yuan. Before leaving, they kidnapped five members of the wealthier Wu family. The local people were helpless and allowed them to search and loot. Only after the bandits had left did they report to the county government for arrest, but they had disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Capsized Boat Narrowly Avoids Disaster: A horse-drawn boat traveling from Zhujiajiao to Zhangliantang capsized yesterday afternoon at the Lianhe River estuary due to strong winds that broke the sail. The more than ten passengers all fell into the water. Fortunately, they grabbed onto the boat boards and were rescued by nearby villagers who heard their cries for help.</p>
<p>Education Bureau Plans to Borrow Emergency Funds: The education funds in this county have always been stretched thin. Because the summer vacation is approaching, the education funds for April, May, and June have not yet been secured. It is proposed to borrow 30,000 yuan in emergency funds to be used for summer vacation payments. This matter has been agreed upon by the local administrative authorities and submitted to the county administrative meeting for approval.</p>
<p>Defense Corps Clashes with the Public: The Beishan Defense Corps in this county clashed with the public the day before yesterday. The incident occurred because villagers were celebrating a deity in the Chenghuang Temple (commonly known as "making a society"). A large crowd of worshipers gathered like a wall. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon, more than ten troublemakers carried a statue into the defense corps headquarters (because the headquarters was originally located in the Chenghuang Temple). The defense corps members tried to stop them, but they were too aggressive. The corps commander ordered more than ten shots to be fired into the sky to stop them, but this incited the crowd, making the situation even more tense. Fortunately, the district party headquarters and the district office intervened and managed to resolve the matter. Subsequently, the district chief, Zhang Deru, and the corps commander, Lu Qi, reported to the county government. The county government immediately dispatched police to the countryside and arrested the thirteen ringleaders, who will be interrogated.</p>

The suspect was arrested by the seventh branch of the Public Security Bureau and sent to the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, he was sent to the county for investigation. The criminal monk Wang Delin confessed that he saw the money and became greedy. He entered the nunnery at night with his face blackened with tin foil ash to scare and extort money. When he failed, he strangled Miaode to death with his belt. The investigation officer, Zhou Cheng, immediately ordered him to be shackled and imprisoned pending judgment.</p>
<p>County Rural Clearing Bureau Established: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs recently stated that although the lake bandits in Taihu Lake have been wiped out, the counties along the lake and nearby should actively clear the countryside. Therefore, it specially issued regulations for handling rural clearing, ordering eleven counties, including Wujiang, Wuxian, and Wuxi, to establish rural clearing bureaus as soon as possible to carry out rural clearing. County Magistrate Sun of this county has received the order and is preparing to establish the County Rural Clearing Bureau on the 16th of this month, with County Magistrate Sun concurrently serving as the bureau chief. The bureau will be located in the county government, and rural clearing sub-bureaus will be established in each district, with the district chief concurrently serving as the sub-bureau chief.</p>
<p>Resolutions of the First District: The First District Office of Xiyi has been located in the county government. Recently, District Chief Qian has been approved by the county government to relocate to the original site of the Municipal Preparatory Office. The seventh district affairs meeting was held the other day, and the following major cases were resolved: (1) How to raise funds for township offices and public projects. It was resolved that the district office should submit a report to the county government requesting instructions. (2) Opening slaughterhouses.

<p>Gun Purchase Case Shrouded in Suspicion: On the morning of the 31st of last month, detectives from the county police brigade suddenly went to the Hongyusheng Rice Store on Guanqian Street and took away an assistant named Ding Fubao. For several days, he was neither interrogated nor transferred to the county. For a time, rumors spread on the street, but the truth remains unknown. The store is owned by Xing, whose son is currently a staff member of the County Government Social Investigation Office. According to him, after Ding Fubao was detained, his mother came to his house to borrow thirty yuan, but he refused because he could not afford it. She came to borrow every day for two days in a row, almost kneeling down and begging, but eventually left in disappointment. He (Xing himself) personally went to the brigade headquarters to visit Ding Fubao and saw that his face was pale and his limbs seemed to have been injured. He learned that a squad member from the Third Company had sold a pistol to someone else through Ding. The day after that, the brigade headquarters suddenly sent police to summon Xing to the team. The brigade commander personally asked him, saying that Ding Fubao had confessed that the pistol was indeed sold by him through Xing. Xing firmly denied it. At first, he was going to be detained, but because Xing was currently a county government staff member, he was released. According to Xing Zhongqing, the pistol was bought by someone from a sand camp. It is also rumored that Xing Cuqing and someone in the police team had a dispute over a woman, which led to this prison sentence. The truth is still difficult to ascertain.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Setting Off Firecrackers: After midnight the other night, County Magistrate Sun suddenly heard the sound of gunfire in the distance and, fearing an accident, immediately sent the county police team to investigate. It was discovered that Huang Yuhu, the owner of Zhang Xiaoquan Scissor Shop, had set off firecrackers for a birthday celebration. Huang was taken into custody and slightly reprimanded before being released. Yesterday, the County Public Security Bureau issued a notice strictly prohibiting the setting off of firecrackers.</p>

His family went to the hospital to collect his body in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee</p>
<h3 id="e108">Explains Method of Electing Representatives <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Must be elected according to law ten days in advance. The Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee is scheduled to convene a meeting of member representatives from all industry guilds in the city on the 21st of this month to formally establish the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The committee has now sent letters to each guild to quickly elect representatives. However, there are many who do not understand the method of calculating the number of representatives and the number of employees. The Secretariat has provided a detailed explanation as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Method of calculating the number of representatives and the number of employees. Each guild may elect one representative, but if the average number of employees in each store belonging to the guild (because the number of employees in the store may be different in the first and second half of the year or each month, so the average number should be obtained) exceeds fifteen, then for every fifteen people exceeding that number, one additional representative may be added, but the maximum should not exceed twenty-one. This method allows guilds with more employees to have a corresponding increase in the number of representatives in the chamber of commerce. This is very different from the previous chamber of commerce, where each guild often only elected one or two people as members of the chamber of commerce, which often led to the affairs of the chamber of commerce being monopolized by one or two people. Therefore, the number of representatives elected by the guilds to attend the chamber of commerce this time should be increased as much as possible, and it should not be like the previous practice of only one or two people per guild. As far as the burden of membership fees is concerned, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously charged 100 yuan for each additional member, but now it has been reduced to 50 yuan. Therefore, based on the amount of membership fees paid, those who could only elect two people in the past can now elect four people. The number of employees should be calculated based on the total number of employees in each store belonging to the guild, not the clerks and employees employed by the guild itself. This point should be especially clear.</p>
<p>(2) Method of electing representatives. The representatives elected by the members of the guild should be recommended by the executive committee of the guild and given a letter of authorization to notify the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee. If the guild's internal structure has not been reorganized in accordance with the law and the old board of directors system is still used, then it should be recommended by the board of directors. The industry group reorganization committee should be recommended by the reorganization committee. When the guilds elect more than one representative, they should also be elected from stores with a larger number of employees. This is stipulated in the detailed rules for the implementation of the Chamber of Commerce Law. The representatives of companies or stores should be recommended by the board of directors or shareholders and managers. (3) Membership of stores. According to the Chamber of Commerce Law, stores may join the Chamber of Commerce as store members independently only if there is no same industry in the city, or if there is a same industry but there is no organization of the same industry guild. However, there are still the following two methods for store members in this city: (A) If there is a same industry guild but the guild has not registered with the Chamber of Commerce, or if it has registered but has not accepted guidance and reorganization, it should still be considered as having no same industry guild, and the stores in that industry may still join the Chamber of Commerce as store members independently. (B) Organizations of more than one industry, such as the Chinese Cotton Mill Federation, the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silk Mill Cocoon Industry General Association, and the Jiangsu Match Federation, are fundamentally inconsistent with the Industrial and Commercial Industry Guild Law, so they should also be considered as having no same industry guild, and their members may still join the Chamber of Commerce independently. The number of representatives elected by store members is stipulated by the Chamber of Commerce Law to be from one to three.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>(4) Qualifications of member representatives. Regardless of whether it is a guild or a store, the representatives they elect must be citizens of the Republic of China who are engaged in commerce in this region and are over 25 years of age. Those who have any of the following circumstances may not serve as representatives: (A) Those who have been deprived of civil rights and have not yet had them restored. (B) Those who have engaged in counter-revolutionary activities and have been convicted by a court. (C) Those who have been declared bankrupt and have not yet had their rights restored, or those who have engaged in commerce and have become insolvent or bankrupt and have not yet restored their credit. (D) Those who lack the capacity to act, that is, those who have not reached the legal age and are mentally deficient as stipulated in the current General Principles of the Civil Code.</p>
<p>(5) Membership fees to be paid by representatives. The basic membership fees to be paid by each guild or store must be determined by the general meeting of members, so they cannot be collected yet. However, the attendance fees for representatives have been approved by the Social Bureau and submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for record. The amount of collection is as follows: (A) Guild representatives will be charged an attendance fee of 50 yuan per person, plus 15 yuan for repaying construction public bonds, for a total of 65 yuan. (B) Store representatives will be charged an attendance fee of 30 yuan per person, plus 9 yuan for repaying construction public bonds, for a total of 39 yuan. The above attendance fees should be paid together with the notification of the recommended representative to the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee.</p>
<p>(6) Deadline for electing representatives. According to the resolution of the plenary meeting of the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee, the representatives should be elected by the 10th of this month because the committee still has various preparatory procedures to be completed after the representatives of each industry have been elected, which may be too late.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Will Recruit Chinese Deputy Engineer <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>After the chief inspector of the Dredging Bureau, a foreign employee named Hada, was robbed and killed, the chief engineer of the bureau, Chadli, believed that there was no suitable talent to fill the vacancy, but the matter was important and should not be delayed for too long. Therefore, a meeting was held, and Director Song and others advocated recruiting a Chinese to serve as the deputy engineer. It was decided to recruit a Chinese mechanical deputy engineer, who must have diplomas and experience certificates in several specializations, such as mechanical engineering, shipping, and sand casting, to be reviewed by the chief engineer of the bureau. If qualified, they will be interviewed in person. They must report to the bureau for duty by the 18th of this month at the latest. The monthly salary will be fixed at 400 taels of silver.</p>
<p>Silk Factory Industry</p>
<h3 id="e111">Guild Holds Committee Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Guild convened a committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. The executive committee members who attended included Wang Xiaolai, Zhu Jingan, Shen Huachen, Huang Jinfan, Zhang Yunsheng, and Zhang Peishen. Shen Huachen chaired the meeting as usual, and six important cases were resolved: (1) It was discussed that the Zhejiang Railway lacked freight cars for transporting cocoons, causing the cocoons waiting to be transported to pile up at the station, resulting in huge losses due to sun and rain. It was resolved to telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government to negotiate with the Railway Bureau to allocate more freight cars for quick transportation. (2) It was discussed that the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee sent a letter stating that a meeting of representatives of the industry guilds would be held on June 21 and requesting the election of representatives to attend. It was resolved that all members of the committee would attend. (3) It was discussed that the market price of silk for export was still sluggish, while the cost of cocoons was very high, making the future dangerous. Workers in the Japanese silk and cotton industries voluntarily reduced their salaries by 20%. China, with its rising cost of living, must take both into consideration. It was resolved that the treatment of employees and female workers would be maintained for the time being. If it becomes absolutely necessary, it will be discussed further. The festival awards for female workers will be issued from June onwards according to the previous year's practice. (4) It was discussed that the Social Bureau sent a letter inquiring about the silk factory industry's habit of paying employees double salaries at the end of the year. The consensus was that double salaries at the end of the year were a special reward from the factory, which was customary but not legally mandated. Some factories paid them at the end of the year, while others did not, because they were actually suffering losses. Those who had informed the guild in advance that they would not pay were communicating mutual understanding. It was resolved to reply truthfully. (5) It was discussed that the previous request to the government to abolish the three-part form for transporting cocoons and to exempt them from the inland transit tax. The Ministry of Finance replied that according to the Chief Inspector of Customs, the Shanghai Customs did not require the use of the three-part form for purchasing cocoons. The request to order the customs to abolish the three-part form should not be considered. Foreign merchants, according to the treaty, do not pay inland taxes when purchasing cocoons. Therefore, they use the three-part form to pay the inland transit tax. Now, Chinese merchants pay local taxes and should naturally be able to pass through with tax receipts and should not use the three-part form or imitate the payment of the inland transit tax. It was resolved to ask the Silk Cocoon General Association to investigate the case and reapply to the government for clear regulations to be followed. (6) It was discussed that the Silk Cocoon General Association previously discussed the new method of adding a stamp to the sales order for raw silk and that the guarantee form prepared by the Export Silk Guild when manufacturers sell silk should be in both Chinese and Western languages. It was resolved to ask the Silk Cocoon General Association to proceed according to the discussion. The meeting adjourned. (Appendix: Telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government) Chairman Zhang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the spring cocoons in Zhejiang Province are being transported to Shanghai in full swing, but the Railway Bureau cannot allocate more freight cars, causing them to pile up at various stations along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Because the cocoons in these areas are close to the road and related to silk reeling, they are not dried sufficiently. Now, without vehicles for rapid transportation, they are piling up on the platforms and are prone to mold and rot from sun and rain. Some have already suffered irreparable losses. Please, Your Excellency, take into account the difficulties of the merchants, which are related to their capital, and immediately request the Railway Bureau to urgently increase the number of freight cars to facilitate the quick transportation of cocoons stored at various stations. We are extremely grateful. Shen Huachen, Chairman of the Shanghai Special City Silk Factory Industry Guild Committee, bows in song.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Gong Fengqiang, a member of the Foreign Affairs Discussion Committee, pointed out that the Chinese government's neglect of international propaganda has often led to misunderstandings that have adversely affected diplomacy. Therefore, at yesterday's regular meeting of the committee, he proposed establishing news agencies and operating newspapers in the capitals of various major powers to be new international eyes and ears and benefit diplomacy. A unanimous resolution was passed to submit it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for proper consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Land Bureau Sets Deadline for Tax Payment <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Director of the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau, Zhu Yan, announced to all property owners:</p>
<p>Announcement Regarding the Payment of Taxes: It is hereby announced that people who buy and sell land within the Shanghai Special Municipality must pay taxes in accordance with the regulations. It has now been found that there are a large number of old deeds for which taxes have not been paid and ownership has not been transferred. In order to reorganize municipal taxes and consolidate people's property rights, all property owners who used Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance deeds under the jurisdiction of the former Shanghai and Bao counties must come to the bureau to pay taxes and transfer ownership by the end of June. After the deadline, a penalty of three times the normal tax will be imposed. All property owners must comply with this announcement.</p>
<p>Postal Workers' Two Unions</p>
<h3 id="e114">Demand Abolition of Parcel Tax <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The parcel tax began in 1927, and its tax rate is 2.5%, but it is actually more than 5%. It is said that Shanghai and Peiping are the two places with the highest revenue from this tax. The revenue from the parcel tax in Shanghai was approximately 600,000 yuan in the previous year, and it is said to have been approximately 1.2 million yuan last year. Because this tax rate greatly affects people's lives, before the National Tariff Reduction Conference is convened, postal workers, feeling the severity of this tax, have jointly requested the Ministry of Communications to abolish this tax rate.</p>

<p>Elect Representatives to Petition the Provincial Government</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the Bao Xing Twin Pagodas in Western Zhejiang, after repeated letters and telegrams from local gentry and fellow villagers in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou requesting restoration, the Department of Civil Affairs has telegraphed the Pinghu County Magistrate not to demolish it without authorization and to investigate and report. However, the County Magistrate Fang Li, who previously agreed with the demolition, suddenly changed his attitude and deceitfully presented to the Department of Civil Affairs that the pagoda was swaying in the wind and attached an opinion proposing to demolish it and erect a small stele with the inscription "Bao Xing Pagoda" and other words. The local gentry, upon learning of this, were surprised that the County Magistrate, as an official of the revolutionary government, should be fair and truthful, but instead used deceitful words to deceive his superiors. In addition to resolving to elect representatives to go to the province to file a petition, they also sent letters to fellow villagers in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou to seek their opinions on correcting the magistrate's absurd actions. The Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association has received this news and will continue to proceed with the restoration and preservation of the ancient pagoda and will actively deal with the county magistrate.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Domestic Goods Factory Federation yesterday sent letters to various factories stating that the Jiaxing County Domestic Goods Promotion Committee had previously invited them to hold a mobile domestic goods exhibition and had recommended Lu Xingzhuang, Mou Yueqiu, and Sun Fuji to go for negotiations.

You are hereby notified to send representatives to attend the meeting on time to discuss matters together.</p>
<p>Municipal Government to Send Personnel</p>
<h3 id="e117">to Participate in Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Committee <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Agriculture and Mining convened a meeting to reorganize the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Affairs Bureau, which was advanced to the 24th of last month. It was decided at the meeting that the ministry would establish the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Committee, and the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the Shanghai Municipal Government would each send one member to participate. Yesterday, the municipal government received a telegram notification from the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining and immediately instructed the Social Bureau to investigate, send personnel, and report back.</p>
<p>Police Sergeants</p>
<h3 id="e118">Add Copper Numbers to Collar Patches <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>In order to facilitate inspection of police sergeant discipline and diligence,</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau submitted a special report to the municipal government for record yesterday regarding the addition of copper numbers to the police sergeant collar patches. The report stated that Article 8 of the revised police uniform regulations issued by the Ministry of Interior stated that the police sergeant collar patches should have the place name on the left and the bureau name on the right, using copper material. Article 9 stated that the police sergeant lapel badges should indicate the position, name, and number for easy inspection. However, the lapel badge is worn on the left chest pocket, with only the upper end exposed, making it difficult to identify the position, name, and number. If a police sergeant exceeds his authority while on duty, the public often has no way to report it because they do not know his name and number. The lapel badge is 3 inches high and 2.5 inches wide, and the capacity for characters is limited, making it difficult to see clearly without detailed inspection, and the writing is easily blurred over time. Therefore, it is necessary to improve and change it. It is now proposed to add copper numbers to the police sergeant collar patches, with the place name and district on the left and the copper number on the right. They are divided into three types: patrol sergeant, patrol officer, and petition officer, all numbered sequentially from number one. The patrol sergeant collar patch will have the words "patrol sergeant" added before the number, the petition officer collar patch will have the word "petition" added before the number, and the regular patrol officer will only have the number without the words "patrol officer." This change is neither in violation of the regulations nor obviously marked, and it is also more convenient for inspecting police sergeant discipline and diligence. It is reported that the municipal government has already issued an order to approve it for record.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Crisis in Chinese Cigarette Industry <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Emergency Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Petition to Beijing for Relief</p>
<p>Since last year, the Chinese cigarette industry has been in dire straits. Even large companies such as Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company have stopped production for reorganization. As of now, no fewer than a dozen large and small companies have continued to stop production. In March, they requested the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee to report to the government for relief. It is now learned that the industry is facing an inability to maintain itself due to the continuous sharp decline in foreign exchange rates. Therefore, an emergency meeting of all members was convened yesterday. The number of attendees was unusually high. Chairman Wu Tingsheng reported the purpose of the meeting, and the members described various painful situations, some with tears in their eyes. The main point was that the cost of raw materials was increasing daily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates, while the selling price was limited by tax levels, making it difficult to stop. Representatives from the Municipal Citizen Training Committee were greatly moved when they learned of the situation. As a result, it was resolved to petition Beijing for relief. The original plan was for all members to go, but after the Municipal Citizen Training Committee representatives explained that the number of people was not an issue, it was decided to form a petition group. Wu Tingsheng, Lao Jingxiu, Shen Xingde, Bao Gengsheng, Yao Jixian, Fan Songzhou, Weng Guangtian, and others were elected as representatives to carry out the petition to Beijing. It was also resolved to ask the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee to send personnel to lead and the Municipal Party Department to provide assistance. They will depart as soon as the procedures are completed.</p>

<p>Shanghai County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, considering that the personnel registration in this county has not yet been carried out and cannot be delayed any further, yesterday instructed all district chiefs to conduct it uniformly within this month, and to report the dates of compliance and the progress to this office for verification and approval.</p>
<p>National Medical Association</p>
<h3 id="e121">Request to Postpone the Promulgation of the Provisional Regulations for Physicians <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The National Medical Association, due to the fact that the (Provisional Regulations for Physicians) promulgated by the Ministry of Health for the first time were not in line with current needs, convened a national medical representative conference in November of last year, with over forty organizations from seventeen provinces participating in joint discussions. They unanimously decided to support the Central Health Commission's Decision No. 15, requesting the Ministry of Health to relax the registration qualifications for the first batch of physicians and sending representatives to Beijing to present their case in person. The Ministry of Health adopted their suggestions and submitted the revised regulations to the Legislative Yuan for review. Now, the revised regulations have been passed by the Legislative Yuan in its 88th meeting (the revised regulations were published in various newspapers on May 11). However, regarding articles 1, 2, 5, 15, etc. in the regulations, various medical associations have sent letters to the National Medical Association, believing that there are still difficulties in implementation. The Association's fifth executive committee meeting decided to draft a telegram to the Ministry of Health requesting a temporary postponement of the promulgation and implementation. The telegram issued by the Association yesterday is reproduced below: To Minister Liu of the Ministry of Health: Reports indicate that the Provisional Regulations for Physicians passed by the Legislative Yuan are dissimilar to the initial promulgation and also greatly different from the revised draft shown by the Medical Administration Department of your ministry on December 16 last year. There are many points that are difficult to implement, causing widespread confusion and complaints. This association has received letters from medical associations in various places, offering contributions on articles 1, 2, 5, and 15. We plan to compile these opinions and submit them to you in the coming days. We earnestly request a temporary postponement of promulgation and implementation. Furthermore, the full text passed by the Legislative Yuan this time is vastly different from the draft submitted by your ministry to the Yuan. We do not know whether it was modified on the spot by the Legislative Yuan or whether your ministry re-drafted a second draft. We hope for your guidance. Respectfully, Chairman Xu Naili of the National Medical Association.</p>

<p>Bao Shan County Magistrate Qiu Mingjiu convened a meeting of the heads of security groups in various districts of the county in the conference hall of the county government at 2:00 PM yesterday. Yang Weixiong, Sun Qixian, Yan Guangen, Wang Qingtao, Lu Pu, and Wang Tongfu attended. County Magistrate Qiu chaired the meeting and reported on one item: the district group seals have been made according to the issued format and are awaiting orders for distribution. Discussed one item: the roster of group members in each district, except for the third district, should be quickly created and reported for verification and issuance of symbols. It was decided that the rosters of group members in each unreported district must be submitted completely within this week (from the 1st to the 7th). One item: the clothing and other forms for each district should be made and reported monthly starting from May according to the format issued by this office for verification and transfer. It was decided that the forms to be reported by each district for May should be filled out and submitted within one week, and thereafter be created and reported monthly without delay. One item: Approve the letter from the county party committee on opinions for rectifying the county's security groups. It was requested to discuss the plan. It was decided that the head of each district security group should convene the heads of each township and town to inquire in detail about the local situation and then discuss the plan again at the meeting next month.</p>

<p>For One Copper Coin</p>
<p>Little Ningbo Dies Bitterly</p>
<p>Bridge rickshaw pulling is a new invention by beggars in recent years, one of their methods of begging for money. Because there are many child beggars at each bridge, strict rules are set: if a vehicle (limited to rickshaws and charter cars) passes, if Beggar A greets it first, then Beggar B cannot compete to avoid competition. But on the afternoon of the 29th of last month, a rickshaw came onto the Garbage Bridge. The child beggar named Little Ningbo greeted it first, but his business was snatched away by a beggar named Wang Agen, and the one copper coin thrown by the passenger was taken by Wang. Little Ningbo, with the weak being prey to the strong, was unwilling, and thus they fought each other. Under fists and feet, Little Ningbo was injured internally and fell to the ground, dying shortly after. The police arrested the murderous beggar Wang Agen and another beggar Wang Zirong and took them to the police station, and reported the case to the magistrate to inspect the body and order its burial. Yesterday, they were sent to the Special District Local Court. Wang Zirong testified about the circumstances of the incident. Judge Wu concluded the interrogation and sentenced Wang Agen to four years of imprisonment. Wang Zirong was released to continue his life as a beggar.</p>
<p>Already Publicly Prosecuted</p>
<h3 id="e125">Case of Burying a Boy Alive <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Hou Genbao Denies Everything</p>
<p>The Facts of the Case Await Investigation</p>
<p>Guan Maoda, Thirteen-Year-Old Son of Guan Liukun of Guan Lane, Tanziwan, Zhabei, Was Buried Alive on April 8th. It was later discovered that his maternal nephew, Hou Genbao, committed the crime due to an affair with his daughter, Guan Caidi, and to seize property. The Fourth District Police Station arrested Hou Genbao, while Guan Caidi fled. The case was handed over to the Local Court for investigation and public prosecution was initiated. Judge Deng held a court hearing yesterday. Hou Genbao claimed, "I am being wronged." The judge asked, "Why did you confess at the Fourth District Police Station?" (Answer) "I was tortured." (Question) "Why did you confess again at the Public Security Bureau?" (Answer) "They taught me to say that, and I dared not refuse for fear of torture." (Question) "Why did you run away?" (Answer) "On the ninth day, my maternal uncle told me to look for my cousin, and I wasn't running away. Later, I heard that I was involved, so I surrendered to the police station." Guan Liukun testified, "Mao Da is my son, and Cai Di is my daughter, but they were born to two different wives. Hou Genbao is the son of my younger sister, Hou Guan. Cai Di was not betrothed to Genbao. Mao Da was taken out to catch frogs by Hou Genbao at 1:00 PM on the eighth day. Around 3:00 PM, Genbao returned alone, supposedly to dig bamboo shoots for me. Later, after my son went missing, Genbao claimed to be searching for him on my behalf. After the body was discovered, his mother said that on the fourth day, Genbao dug a hole next to Tianshan. When his mother asked him, he said it was to bury a large crock. Unexpectedly, he pushed my son into the hole and buried him alive." The judge asked, "Besides his mother, is there anyone else who can testify to this matter?" (Answer) "No." At this point, Hou Guan testified, "I never said that my son dug a hole in advance. Because after Mao Da went missing, I also helped to search. I saw new soil next to the tomb, so I dug it up and saw a foot, which aroused my suspicion. After digging completely, I saw Mao Da's body, so I called Liukun to come and see." Patrolman Shi Zhaoyu testified that Hou Genbao was caught by them and did not surrender himself. When asked, the local guarantor Hou Shuren said that he knew nothing about the inside story before or after the event. Since the case still needs to be investigated, the judge ordered no debate to be opened, and the defendant was remanded in custody to await a rescheduled trial, and then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Gold-Inlaid Jade Ring <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai is Full of Swindlers</p>
<p>A Country Woman Almost Falls for a Scam</p>
<p>A country woman, Zhang Xu, accidentally visited Shanghai and fell victim to a scam. The woman was walking on Lan Road the other evening when she noticed three people on the left side of the road examining jewelry. One was the seller, and the other two were buyers. The seller took out a jade ring, saying that it was worth a lot but he needed money urgently, so he was only selling it for four taels of gold. The two buyers both wanted to buy it but complained that the price was too high and were still commenting. The country woman also stepped forward to play with it. The seller eagerly urged her to buy it, and the other two buyers also encouraged her, persuading the seller to lower the price. However, the country woman had no money on her, but her young daughter who was traveling with her had one tael of gold and an umbrella. The seller said that he urgently needed money, and although one tael of gold was too low, he was willing to sell it if she added the umbrella. After the woman made the deal and examined the ring carefully, she realized that it was not a gold-inlaid jade ring, but a counterfeit. Those people had not gone far, and she called out to Chinese Constable No. 1287, who apprehended Wang Changgen, a Ningbo native who was selling the ring, and took him to the Yangshupu Police Station. Unexpectedly, Wang Sanda and Wang Asan, two accomplices from Wuxi who were pretending to be buyers, went to the entrance of the police station to spy on the situation. Zhang Xu recognized them as the accomplices when she and Chinese Constable No. 1287 came out of the police station, so she had the two Wangs arrested as well. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Feng interrogated them. The three admitted to the deception and claimed that the fake jewelry was bought from the City God Temple for only thirty cents. Judge Feng, after verifying the confessions, sentenced Wang Changgen and the other two to six months of imprisonment each. The fake jade ring was confiscated, and the one silver dollar and one umbrella were returned to the original owner to claim.</p>

<h3 id="e128">News of the Reception of Nanshi Wharf <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Payment can be made in mid-month. The Municipal Government Port Authority previously intended to develop the city's port plan by taking over the Dada and Datong wharves in Nanshi and then designating them for lease to various Chinese shipping companies to achieve unification. This matter was previously reported in this newspaper. Now, it is learned that the negotiations between the Port Authority and Dada and Datong regarding the takeover procedures have been settled, and the Chinese shipping companies leasing the wharves have also followed the Port Authority's order to pay a deposit of 700,000 yuan. On April 15th, they had already paid the first installment, which was one-tenth, or 70,000 yuan. Now, the Port Authority has notified the companies to continue to raise the second installment of the deposit before the 15th of this month, which is required to be five-tenths. The Port Authority will then transfer the deposit received to Dada and Datong companies as compensation for the recovery of the wharves. Dada Company has a total of nine wharves, while Datong Company has a total of four wharves. Because the Port Authority is eager to take over, it plans to first pay 290,000 yuan from this second installment to the two companies, with 110,000 yuan going to Datong and 180,000 yuan going to Dada. The remaining wharf compensation will be paid when the third installment of the deposit is received. It has also been agreed that after collecting the second installment of the deposit, a draft contract for leasing the wharves will be signed with each shipping company.</p>

<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau recently organized the traffic on Dongmen Road in the 16th Concession, dividing the public land on the north side of Dongmen Road into parking lots. White lines were used to delineate the boundaries and signs were installed to designate parking locations for automobiles and rickshaws. After the Public Works Bureau removes the accumulated construction materials at the end of May, it will proceed with the layout. It is learned that the signs have been erected separately. However, there is a wooden house selling groceries on the sidewalk next to the parking lot, and there are several floating stalls nearby, which are obstructing the passage of vehicles. The Bureau has sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau requesting the district authorities to order the demolition and relocation of these structures and to effectively direct vehicles to park in order, so as to facilitate traffic.</p>

On the evening of the following day (the 4th), the Water Patrol Police sent detectives to take the two persons Zhang and Ni Buchun together with the guns and bullets back to the Police Station for interrogation at the Special District Local Court. However, as the case fell under the jurisdiction of the garrison, the two men and women were handed back to the Public Security Bureau by the Police Station on the evening of the day before yesterday (the 6th) to await transfer to the Garrison Headquarters for trial by military law. Since the number of guns and bullets seized after they were transferred to the Water Patrol Police Station was very large, the Police Station continued to send officers to guard them day and night in shifts, awaiting orders from their superiors for disposition.</p>

<p>Eight Timbres Complete</p>
<p>Among our country's music, the oldest and most valuable is none other than Zhonghe Shaole. Confucius praised it as perfect and complete, and even said that after hearing the Shao in Qi, he did not know the taste of meat for three months. Qin Shihuang burned books and buried scholars, destroying rites and music, but Shao alone survived. Dynasties past have placed great importance on its function, which can improve the atmosphere, eliminate violence, and avert disasters in the unseen world, bringing heavenly blessings from above and harmonizing the people's will below. Although the early Qing also intended to revise it, there were many inaccuracies in the music laws and palace scores, making it difficult to revive the true essence of the country's music. Since the creation of the new national grand music, the Datong Music Association of this port has repeatedly participated in national diplomacy, and Westerners who have heard it have praised it, recognizing the correct path of national music. Now, to take it to the next level, the revised Zhonghe Shaole score will adopt the new system, and all ordinary silk and bamboo instruments will also be added to increase the prevalence. Now, all procedures have been fully prepared, and practice can begin next Sunday.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Bank has always been dedicated to serving society. Recognizing that small businesses and those who rely on savings for living have no financing options when they encounter financial difficulties, the bank is launching a pilot program for revolving small credit loans at its Jing'an Temple Road branch, modeled after the Morris Plan Bank system in the United States. This will provide financial assistance to those with stable employment and legitimate needs. It is reported that the interest rate is 1% per annum, and the monthly repayment is calculated by the bank at an annual interest rate of 4%. This approach is unprecedented in the Chinese banking industry and demonstrates the bank's commitment to adjusting civilian finances.</p>

<p>Descendants of Zhou Fuju</p>
<h3 id="e139">Accused of Not Returning Pawned Items <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Liquidation of Wuchangtang Property</p>
<p>Borrowers File a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Zhou Zitian, a descendant of the late salt merchant Zhou Fuju, pawned the title deeds of 1,200 mu of land in the Dayu Company, Lihetai household, in Juegang, Nantong, 720 shares of the Pulisha Factory Zhou Zhiji and Zhou Xinji, and the title deeds of 1,200 mu of land in the Xinfuxiang household of the Dayu Company to Deyu Company, Nikkyoji Company, and Zhenyujunji Firm in September of the year before last, borrowing 67,000 taels of silver. Zhou Zishan guaranteed the loan with the property of Zhou Wuchangtang. The loan term was six months with an interest rate of 11 taels per month per thousand taels. When the term expired, Zitian did not redeem the items. The managers of the three pledgees hired lawyers to file a lawsuit, requesting the court to order the two Zhous to jointly repay the loan. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenyong of the Special District Local Court held a hearing, but the defendants did not appear. The plaintiff's lawyer presented evidence, and the defendant's lawyer stated that the defendant fully admitted to the loan, but the property of Wuchangtang was jointly owned by five branches, and Zishan was only managing it on their behalf. The property is currently being liquidated and its assets are being verified. Although there are more than one million yuan in assets, after deducting debts of 600,000 to 700,000, there is little left. However, the creditor's rights will not be lost. After the plaintiff filed the lawsuit, Wang Wenmei was sent to register at the Zhou Wuchangtang liquidation office, and the creditor also attended the meeting. This shows that the plaintiff has acknowledged the liquidation by the liquidation office, so the case should be suspended. However, according to Wang Wenmei, who attended the court, he went to inquire about the Zhou Wuchangtang liquidation advertisement because he was a middleman in the loan and was not commissioned by the plaintiff. After the lawyers for both parties finished their arguments, Judge Xu ordered the parties to wait until the morning of June 11 for the judgment.</p>
<p>Mother Sues Daughter to Recover Separated Property</p>
<p>Judge Orders Both Parties to Reconcile Outside of Court</p>
<p>Hou Liu, a local woman residing in Tanjia Ferry in the northwest township of this county, recently hired lawyer Wang Chengkuan to sue her biological daughter Jinjie (i.e., Jin Jinjie) in the Local Court for being unstable and remarrying after her husband's death. She requested to recover the divided property. Her statement was roughly as follows: The plaintiff is 66 years old this year and has no sons, only one daughter, the defendant Jinjie. When her first husband was alive, he raised a son named Xiaomao. She also recruited a son-in-law, Shen Agao, for the defendant. The defendant gave birth to a daughter, Yueying. In April of the Republic of China, because the son and the defendant had both grown up, she divided her late husband's property to Xiaomao (i.e., Hou Xiaomao, two mu, three fen, and nine li of land), and the defendant inherited two mu, four fen, three li, and one hao of land. All the houses were divided equally between Xiaomao and the defendant, and a contract was established. The plaintiff's food and clothing were to be provided by the defendant, and the plaintiff's aunt (who is currently 83 years old and still alive) was to be supported by the son, Hou Xiaomao. Unexpectedly, the son-in-law (i.e., the defendant's husband) Shen Agao died of illness in 1917. The defendant was unstable and had an affair with Jin Asan (i.e., Yinshan), and went out and seized the property without returning it. Later, due to lack of food and clothing, she forcibly moved back, and she and her subsequent husband abused the plaintiff. Last year, when the Shanghai Special Municipality Land Bureau measured the land, the defendant reported it in the name of her lover, Yinshan, in an attempt to seize the property. According to the law, since the defendant has remarried, her inheritance should be returned to provide for the plaintiff's livelihood. Therefore, she requests the court to order the defendant to return the two mu, four fen, three li, and one hao of land, half of the houses, and the contract to the plaintiff for management. The defendant, Jin Jinjie, also hired lawyer Zhou Yu to file a defense. Judge Han held a hearing yesterday afternoon, and both parties attended with their lawyers. The plaintiff Hou Liu stated the previous events and requested a judgment to return the land. The defendant, Jin Jinjie, testified that she was 48 years old and had not abused her mother. The judge said, "If you don't abuse the plaintiff on weekdays, why would she sue you?" She answered, "I support my mother." She also claimed that Jin Asan had been living in her house for 13 years. At this point, the defendant's lawyer stated that the plaintiff was a good person and the whole matter was stirred up by Hou Xiaomao. The judge ordered both parties to reconcile outside of court.</p>

<p>What Can the Shipmate Do?</p>
<p>Pan Ligen, 35 years old, Suzhou native, residing at No. 1327, Xinkang Lane, Datong Road, Public Concession, is in the business of ship transport and owns three cargo ships, all of which employ shipmates. He occasionally goes to the ship. One of the shipmates is Shi Zhaorong, 33 years old, Chongming native, whose wife Tang, 32 years old, lives in a rented room at North Caojiazhai, Caojiadu, Shanghai West. Since being hired by Pan last year, Zhaorong spends most of his time on the ship and rarely at home. His wife Tang is beautiful and of a fickle nature and not accustomed to sleeping alone. Before long, she developed an affair with the shipowner Pan Ligen. At first, they were secretly intimate, but later, because Shi was often away on the ship, they did not avoid suspicion. The pair of lovebirds lived together at home. As time went on, the neighbors all knew. Shi occasionally returned home and heard rumors, but because there was no evidence, he sighed. Recently, Shi has become very cautious due to the rumors. One morning, he left home and falsely told his wife that he had to set sail that day. His wife believed him, and that night she slept in the same bed with Pan. The next morning (the 5th), at about 8:00 AM, Shi suddenly returned home and caught the pair of lovebirds together. Shi was furious and tied the two up with hemp rope, intending to beat them severely. A second landlord of the house, Cao Heshang, caught a glimpse of them and, fearing that trouble would arise, immediately reported to the Sixth District Police Station, which sent police to arrest the three men and women along with a rope. After the District Chief Ren interrogated them separately, he determined that the case involved adultery with a married woman, which was a criminal offense. He immediately prepared a document and transferred the case to the Local Court for interrogation and trial.</p>

<p>Wu Liming, residing on Guoqing Road, Zhabei, forcibly defiled a ten-year-old girl, Sun Fengying, on the night of the tenth of last month. The next day, the girl's mother, Sun Huang, washed the girl and saw that her pants were dirty. She was shocked and asked her daughter, who then confessed that she had been forcibly defiled by Wu. The woman reported the matter to the police station in charge, which arrested Wu and sent him to the Local Court for interrogation and detention. The young girl, Sun Fengying, was sent to the Nanyang Hospital for diagnosis on record. It is now learned that according to the examination by the hospital, Sun Fengying's hymen was not broken, but her labia majora and minora were swollen. The court was informed, and the prosecutor has filed a public prosecution. Judge Zhao held a hearing yesterday and appointed lawyer Zhou Yu to defend the defendant. The official ordered the defendant Wu Liming to be brought in for questioning. After a brief trial, the case was adjourned due to the lack of witnesses. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Actually Plans to Sell His Wife for Enjoyment</p>
<p>Wang Xiaodi, 35, of Hejiaqiao Township, Baoshan, has been farming for a living. He has been married to his wife, Zong, 30, for seven years. The couple's relationship has not been very harmonious. Because her husband is not engaged in a proper occupation and wanders around outside, there are often quarrels when he returns home, and life is particularly difficult. In the spring of this year, she left her husband and came to Shanghai to work at the Qixing Mosquito Incense Factory on Jiaozhou Road, Shanghai West, to make a living. However, her husband, Xiaodi, still came to Shanghai from time to time to forcibly demand money from her. Because she earned little, she was unable to provide assistance. After being refused by her last month, Xiaodi became extremely resentful and had evil intentions. He entrusted his fellow villager, Xie Yueqin, to sell his wife for money to spend recklessly. Xie proceeded with the matter. A buyer has already been found, and the price is being negotiated. Unexpectedly, the matter was not kept secret and was heard by her mother (i.e., Xiaodi's mother-in-law), Zong Gu. She came to Shanghai yesterday morning and went directly to her daughter's place. Just as Wang Xiaodi and Xie Yuekui were enticing her daughter to go out, she called the police and arrested them both and took them back to the Sixth District Police Station. After the District Chief Ren questioned them, he transferred the case to the court for interrogation and trial because the testimonies of both parties were contradictory.</p>

<p>Lu Maoqi, an old man from Jiangbei, residing at No. 24, Yongxiang Lane, Datong Road, Zhabei, is engaged in the business of rickshaws. At about 7:45 yesterday morning, he quarreled with his wife over money. Because Lu was ashamed of being henpecked, and could not bear the insults, he swallowed raw opium in a moment of anger to commit suicide. Neighbors noticed and rushed him to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, he had taken too much poison and could not be revived, and died at 6:15 in the evening.</p>

<p>Hu Anqing, a Ningbo native who works as a runner for a customs brokerage, was recently sued for divorce by his wife, Hu Yu, who retained a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the local court for failure to provide alimony. Hu Anqing also retained lawyer Hu Yuanjun to countersue for cohabitation. After a joint hearing, the plaintiff presented three conditions: (1) a house to live in, (2) furniture to be moved back, and (3) 30 yuan per month, with a guarantee of official position. Out-of-court reconciliation failed. Yesterday, Judge Tong Shenglü held another hearing. Hu Anqing's lawyer claimed that after the previous instruction, the defendant had asked his maternal uncle to mediate. The first two conditions were acceptable, but regarding the third, Hu Anqing only earned 30 yuan a month and could not starve himself. Therefore, Hu Anqing offered to pay the plaintiff an additional 5 yuan for personal use, in addition to maintaining all household expenses, but the plaintiff refused. The court then mediated between the two parties. Hu Anqing was willing to pay 20 yuan per month for food expenses, and the plaintiff agreed. Hu's mother, Hu Hu, acted as guarantor for a period of two weeks to make things comfortable. However, the plaintiff asked if she could come to court to collect the money every month. The judge reprimanded, saying, "This court is not your family's accounting office. Once the reconciliation record is made, you can request enforcement if one party fails to perform." Hu Anqing said he could not because the plaintiff was demanding a mansion. The judge said, "It is enough to have a house to live in. Why ask for a foreign-style house?" The judge also added that husband and wife must understand each other and not be petty, causing unrest. The plaintiff should live with the defendant's mother and not only care for her son but also neglect her parents. She should understand this point. He then ordered them to sign, and the husband and wife reconciled, ending the hearing.</p>

<p>Disturbances En Route Should Be Avoided</p>
<p>Both Parties Fined Five Yuan Each</p>
<p>The other day, a young woman, Wang Lu, and Wang Genbao were scuffling with a man, Gao Binggang, near the Caishi Road in the French Concession. The police apprehended them. After questioning by the head constable, Gao Binggang accused the residents of 1020 Huade Road of visiting a friend on Caishi Road when Wang Lu and her daughter, without any explanation, gathered a crowd</p>
<p>to beat him and rob him of his gold ring and glasses.</p>
<p>He requested an investigation. Wang Lu claimed that the woman lived at 23 Lafeide Road. Gao Binggang had previously opened an inn near the woman's house and seduced the woman's daughter, Genbao, into adultery. When the woman found out, Gao commissioned someone to mediate</p>
<p>and agreed to marry Genbao as his wife, and a marriage contract was signed as proof. Unexpectedly, Gao secretly sold the inn and fled. This time, they met on the road, so she confronted him, but there was no beating or robbery. She requested that Gao Binggang be ordered to fulfill the marriage contract, etc. The head constable, noting that each party had their own version of events, ordered them to post bail. Yesterday, they were brought to the French court for questioning. First, the head constable reported the situation. Then, Gao Binggang complained about being beaten, claiming that he had previously opened an inn on Lafeide Road, but Wang Lu's daughter, Genbao, was a prostitute. Although he had slept with her for several nights, he had never agreed to marry her and was being falsely accused. Please examine the testimony of Wang Lu and Wang Genbao, which was slightly different from what they said at the police station. The French judge ruled that the court could not intervene in the matter of marriage. However, the two parties should not cause disturbances on the road, which would disrupt public order. Both the plaintiff and defendant were fined five yuan each as a warning.</p>

In order to facilitate a thorough investigation by his superiors, Director Qu has voluntarily requested a temporary suspension.

<p>Tan Tingjin, the concubine of Cao Xiaolong, a Jiangbei native residing at 2024 Hongrui Lane, Xinzha Road, went to an opium den in Baoyu Lane in the French Concession on April 10th. While passing Dongxin Bridge, she was lured into a house at 16 Mofang Street, Xiafei Road, and imprisoned on the third floor. A ransom of 5,000 yuan was demanded for her release. Someone reported the matter to the Xinzha police station, who dispatched detectives Feng Zhiming and others to rescue the woman. The perpetrators, Zhang Asan, Li Jinbiao, and Zhang's concubine, Wang Afeng, were apprehended and brought before the Special District Local Court for questioning. As previously reported in this newspaper, Judge Wu conducted a follow-up interrogation yesterday afternoon. Tan stated that she had been imprisoned there for two weeks before being rescued by the police and requested strict punishment. Zhang and others denied the charges. Lawyers Fan Gang and Ye Fokang debated on behalf of the plaintiff and defendant, respectively.

<p>Fang Maoqing, residing at 140 Dongtangjia Lane, was previously a shop assistant at Longchang Tobacco Shop. One morning, suffering from abdominal pain, he swallowed opium smoke in an attempt to treat it. He accidentally swallowed an excessive amount, causing his face to turn pale and his limbs to become paralyzed. His wife, Wang, noticed and rushed him to Baolong Hospital for treatment. He died at 4 PM. The hospital reported the death to the Huisi Police Station by telephone, which dispatched Chinese detectives to investigate and confirm the facts. The body was sent to the Feilun Road morgue. At 10 AM yesterday morning, Guo, the prosecutor of the Special District Court,</p>
<p>arrived at the morgue by car with a clerk and medical examiner</p>
<p>to examine the body. According to the report of the Western head constable, the deceased's wife had arrived and requested questioning. Fang Wang, the wife of the deceased, stated that her husband usually suffered from abdominal pain and took opium smoke, which would relieve it. This time, he also took opium smoke, but he died. She wished to claim the body for burial. Prosecutor Guo ruled that the deceased, Fang Maoqing, had indeed died from accidentally swallowing opium smoke and released the body to his wife, Fang Wang, for burial.</p>

As the truck traveled on Songpan Road, the road was uneven, and the truck suddenly tilted to the left. Shao fell to the ground, fracturing his skull and bleeding profusely. His companions immediately took him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but due to the severity of his injuries, he died shortly after arriving at the hospital.</p>

<p>Chen Lüyuan, a 33-year-old local man, was employed at a printing shop near Paohui Stadium. At around 1:30 AM yesterday, he finished work and was returning home, passing Wangping Street on Second Avenue. Suddenly, a person emerged from the darkness, brandishing a sharp blade and arbitrarily threatening him. The robber searched Chen's shirt pocket and stole 185 yuan in banknotes. As the robber attempted to escape with the stolen goods, Chen grabbed his collar and shouted loudly. The robber, fearing that the police would hear the alarm, stabbed Lüyuan twice in the right</p>
<p>thigh. Bleeding profusely, Chen released his grip, and the robber fled. Afterward, Chen Lüyuan reported the incident to the Fourth Avenue General Police Station and requested an arrest. The head constable ordered the arresting officer to escort him to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Using Evil Arts to Deceive and Collect Money <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Exclusively Performing Exorcisms for Others</p>
<p>Banning Is Necessary</p>
<p>Wu Falin, a 47-year-old from Tongzhou, has no legitimate occupation and claims to be able to exorcise ghosts and cure diseases to collect money. Ignorant and foolish people believe this to be true. When they are occasionally afflicted with illness, they do not seek medical treatment but instead spend large sums of money to hire him to perform exorcisms, hoping to be cured. Wu also has three assistants, Ye Yishan, Miao Rusong, and Gu Er. During the exorcism, Wu wears a yellow paper hat and is shirtless, wearing a red cloth skirt below. When his assistants start playing gongs and drums, Wu holds a knife and seal, chanting incantations and running around the patient. Sometimes, he slashes his arm with the knife, causing</p>
<p>fresh red blood to appear. Wu tells people that the blood can ward off evil, and all ghosts and demons that entangle the patient can be frightened away or captured and imprisoned. In short, the purpose is to drive away evil and cure diseases. The foolish people believe him even more and call him a great immortal. Recently, Wu has been performing his tricks extensively in the Qichangzhan area of Pudong. The sick are all deceived. Yesterday afternoon, the Third Precinct police station learned that Wu's strange behavior not only harms local customs but also delays the suffering of patients or even causes them to believe in exorcism and not seek medical diagnosis, resulting in serious illness and death. It is necessary to ban this behavior. The police dispatched officers to arrest Wu and his assistants Ye, Miao, and Gu, along with three yellow paper talismans, a set of gongs and drums, two iron rings, a knife, and a wooden seal, and brought them to the Third Precinct for questioning. Wu and others confessed that they had been hired by three families, including the Xu family, to perform exorcisms and cure diseases and dared not violate the law. The district chief, seeing that these people were using evil arts to deceive people, fined Wu one yuan and strictly warned him not to engage in such money-collecting activities again. The seized items were confiscated. Wu and others obeyed meekly.</p>
<h3 id="e153">An Unimaginable Idea to Seek Revenge <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Bian Xiaomao Seeks Revenge with a Clever Plan</p>
<p>Wu Ruipu's Back Suffers</p>
<p>Bian Xiaomao, a 29-year-old from Yancheng, Jiangbei, operates the Dehe Tobacco and Paper Shop at 31 Hainan West Lane, South Street, Hai Chao Temple, outside Xiaonanmen. Bian is a local rogue who usually recruits apprentices, relies on his strength to bully the weak, and is accustomed to this behavior. People call him "Dragon" out of fear. Last April, he saw Wu Ruipu, an acquaintance from Dongtai who was very honest and tried to recruit him as an apprentice, but Wu did not understand the situation and refused on the spot. Unexpectedly, Bian became resentful and wanted to gather his gang to fight. Wu, fearing his power, had to ask his friend Zhang Xueshu to mediate. Zhang introduced him and gave him five yuan, and then Wu worshipped Bian as his "old man." Later, one of Bian's apprentices, Yang Changlin, who lived at 93 Gaoxiangtou Lane, secretly took dozens of dollars from the clothes box of his cohabitant, Chen Jiuru, last month and fled back to his hometown in Jiangbei. Chen noticed and immediately reported it to the Third Section of the First District, requesting an arrest. The police were dispatched to Bian's house but failed to apprehend him. Afterward, Bian learned that Zhang Changhua, a resident of 108 Kualong Road outside Dananmen, who operated a car boarding house, had reported the matter. Bian resented him and conspired with his friends Chen Xijiu and Xiong Bingxiang to plan revenge. Chen and others suggested that Bian seriously injure one of his apprentices and then send him to Zhang Changhua to cause trouble and falsely accuse him of being beaten and injured, hoping to extort money. Bian agreed and summoned Wu Ruipu to the shop the night before to discuss the plan. Although Wu was reluctant, he feared the ferocity of the "old man" and reluctantly agreed. Bian was overjoyed to see that he had agreed and ordered Wu to take off his upper clothes, lie on a bench, and then used a thick wooden stick to beat Wu's back. Wu was in so much pain that he dared not shout and could only endure the pain in silence. Soon, Wu's back became red and swollen, and his skin began to break, dripping with blood. Finally, Bian ordered him to dress and cut his long hair at the barber shop. When he went to Zhang's house to cause trouble, his head would hit the wall and bleed easily because there was no long hair to stop it. After everything was prepared, he sent him out. When Wu arrived at Zhang's house, he saw Zhang at home, but Wu, who was honest by nature, suddenly did not follow what his master had taught him. At that moment, his conscience was awakened, and he remembered that he had no grudges against Zhang. Why should he harm Zhang? He immediately returned to Bian's shop and falsely claimed that Zhang had gone out. Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, Wu moaned in bed from the pain. Bian sent him to Zhang's house again. Wu, unable to disobey his master's orders, had to endure the pain and go. Unexpectedly, the plan was leaked and Zhang had already heard about it. He immediately called Wang Baozhi, the security guard of the 21st post in the area, who arrested Wu and brought him back to the Third Section of the First District.</p>
<p>Under the preliminary interrogation by Director Jin, it was discovered that Wu's</p>
<p>back was severely injured, and the case was bizarre and Bian's</p>
<p>ferocity was unheard of and extremely illegal. The police were dispatched to the address to arrest him, but Bian knew that the plan had failed and fled, so he was not caught.</p>

<p>Recently, a group of unemployed hooligans has been wandering around the border between the Chinese concession and the foreign settlement or the Bund,</p>
<p>specializing in snatching Westerners' property by the riverbank for their own use. As a result, the police stations have been receiving many reports of robberies in recent days. Yesterday, Wang Xichang, a Chinese detective from the Huisi Police Station, learned that the bandits were hiding in a teahouse at 1 North Fujian Road. He collaborated with Western detective Jack Si Bao and Chinese detective Wu Shoushan and others to secretly arrest Lu Panquan, Yang Yuanxin, Tang Jiangsheng, Tao Haiquan, and other four people and brought them to the police station for questioning. They confessed to committing many street robbery cases, and Yang also confessed to selling a platinum watch worth 60 yuan to Jiang Dongsheng. The Chinese and Western detectives then arrested Jiang and ordered him to be detained for further investigation to identify the victims and send them to court for questioning.</p>

<p>Belgian Minister Attended with Family</p>
<p>Third Race to Be Held Tomorrow Night</p>
<p>The Shanghai motorcycle race was held at Shen Garden yesterday (the 5th) evening for the second performance. Just as the race was about to begin, a sudden downpour lasted for half an hour before stopping, causing the track</p>
<p>to absorb water and become a muddy swamp. Cars driving on it sprayed mud, not only making it difficult for the racers but also dampening the spirits of the enthusiastic</p>
<p>Chinese and foreign spectators. However, the number of attendees was still very high, and the American consul and the Belgian minister attended with their families, showing that the amazing skills of these eleven daredevils had captured the hearts of the people, who were eager to see them. Each race that evening was plagued with bad conditions due to the rain-soaked and slippery track. It was difficult for the riders to control their cars, which often resulted in crashes and accidents, and the machines were often damaged. However, the riders were still brave and continued without fear. Although the program was not completed, their spirit of daring was admirable. Finally, to welcome the Belgian Minister, Mr. Scully held a flying start race for one lap. Mr. Scully ran it with full speed and was praised by the Belgian Minister. The time was 27 and 2/5 seconds. It was difficult to achieve this time on a muddy track. The third performance will be held this Sunday (the 8th) at 9:00 PM, rain or shine. Various machines have been repaired, and any heavy rain will not cause damage.</p>

<p>To the Esteemed Editors of the Shenbao Newspaper:</p>
<p>With utmost respect, we, the tea workers formerly hired by the Minxing Anji Steamer Company's "Hu Da" steamship last July, sought employment and, following the company's regulations, paid deposit fees. Now that the company has suspended its voyages, we have repeatedly negotiated for the return of our deposits, but to no avail. We are all poor villagers and farmers who rely on our labor for a living. The sudden loss of a large sum of money has left us without employment, forcing us to wander the streets of Shanghai for months. We have pawned everything and can no longer borrow money, leaving us hungry, cold, and in extreme distress. As a last resort, we petition the Party and government authorities to order the company to return our deposits and to request appropriate compensation for our losses, so that we may return to our hometowns. At the same time, we appeal for sympathy and assistance from all sectors of society. We have long admired your newspaper's commitment to justice and your support for the oppressed, which prevents the poor and weak from suffering innocently. We have temporarily set up an office in Yangjiadu Houjie, No. 16, Nanshi, to notify the affected tea workers to register and negotiate. We earnestly request that your esteemed newspaper publish this in the news column so that the truth may be known and we may receive assistance to achieve our goal. We would be immensely grateful. With sincere respect, we await your favorable response.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted by the Petitioning Group of Tea Workers of the Minxing Anji Steamer Company's "Hu Da" Steamship, Shanghai.</p>
<p>To the Editors of the Shenbao Newspaper:</p>
<p>Having read your newspaper's news column on June 2nd, which stated that the market price of animal intestines continued to rise, we find it to be inconsistent with the facts. Our member, Guo Shunji, does not have branch factories in northern Anhui or southern Henan. Even considering the stock in Shanghai, there is a significant accumulation. The market price of raw materials began to fall in May. The claim that there is a market but no goods is purely fabricated. We cannot guarantee that someone is not deliberately spreading rumors to disrupt the intestinal industry market. We request that this be corrected.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai Special City Pig Intestine Trade Association, June 6th, Year 19.</p>
<p>To the Editors of the Shenbao Newspaper:</p>
<p>Our client, Mr. Zhang Tianji, informs us that he has read your newspaper's report on June 3rd, titled "Repercussions of Zhang Tianji's Accusation Against Zheng Fuyu." The report mentioned that yesterday, oppressed clerks from the Changlu Salt Smuggling Prevention Bureau submitted a letter to your newspaper. We are unaware of the identities of these so-called oppressed clerks. Can they provide names and take responsibility for their claims? If there are such people who have truly been oppressed, Tianji has been out of office for a year. Why have they not formally reported it until now? The content of the letter is merely a cunning attempt by the defendants Zheng Fuyu and Lu Hongshi (also known as Huanquan) to justify themselves in the case of intimidation and fraud. It is obvious at first glance. We do not hesitate to clarify further as follows:</p>
<p>The letter stated that Tianji embezzled over 1,400 yuan in private case rewards and refused to distribute them, despite repeated requests from the clerks. However, all rewards received by Tianji during his tenure at the Changlu Salt Smuggling Prevention Bureau were distributed monthly. Zheng Fuyu, in particular, received rewards and borrowed hundreds of yuan in advance. He continues to harass us repeatedly. At that time, there were more than a dozen clerks in the bureau, and no one ever mentioned the distribution of rewards, let alone the so-called repeated requests from the clerks. Although a petition signed by Xie Zhen has been submitted requesting the distribution of rewards, a truthful reply has been filed. However, when Zheng was arrested, the detectives from the Huishi Police Station found a directive from Xie Zhen Nong on Zheng's person, indicating that the so-called "claimants" are still under Zheng's influence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zheng and Lu Hongshi fabricated allegations that Tianji engaged in illegal embezzlement and dereliction of duty, without any evidence. They claimed to have printed 5,000 copies (as stated in their letter) and distributed them to various Party and government agencies in an attempt to blackmail him. When Tianji reported the arrest of Zheng, the so-called evidence was found on him, including a list of Tianji's appointed personnel. This list should have been handed over to the successor for record-keeping, but Zheng stole it during the handover to use as blackmail today. His premeditation is clear. Another piece of evidence was an order from Tianji detailing the investigation of any commissioned personnel who were absent from their posts. This was a document for Tianji's rectification of his department. How can it be considered evidence of illegal embezzlement? A third piece of evidence was a letter from Tianji's wife, Zhang Sun Xiuzhen, to Li Qishan. This letter was written out of compassion to request a contribution for the family of a deceased employee, Zhu Guoxiang. How can it be construed as a loss to the government? The rest of the allegations, such as "setting traps" and "preemptive strikes," are merely attempts by Zheng and others to clear their names and are not worth discussing.</p>
<p>We have been entrusted to convey the above information and request that you publish this letter in your esteemed newspaper as a rebuttal.</p>
<p>Respectfully addressed to the Editors of the Shenbao Newspaper,</p>
<p>Lawyer Wang Siji, June 5th.</p>
<p>To the Editors of the Shenbao Newspaper:</p>
<p>Having seen the report in today's newspaper regarding the Xin Da Kiln Factory workers assaulting the police corps, we have learned that there are some inaccuracies.</p>
<p>(1) When the police corps came to search the workers, it was still before dawn, and Pei Cang was not notified. Pei Cang only tried to mediate when someone reported that the workers were arguing about the matter and refusing to work, but it had already become a stalemate.</p>
<p>(2) There are a total of seven workshops, all located outside the factory, about half a mile away. Therefore, the police corps searched the workshops, not the factory itself.</p>
<p>(3) The workers did not resist during the search. It took about two hours to search all seven workshops completely. Afterwards, since no stolen goods were found, the workers questioned Deputy Corps Commander Gong. Instead of comforting them, Gong used harsh official language, which angered them and led to the assault.</p>
<p>(4) Gong and Wang are currently receiving medical treatment at Shanghai Hospital. They sustained minor injuries and will be discharged soon.</p>
<p>The above are all facts and should not be dismissed summarily. We have already submitted a request to the county government to send personnel for a thorough investigation to ensure a fair resolution to this case. We would be grateful if your esteemed newspaper could publish this letter.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted by He Pei Cang, owner of the Xin Da Kiln Factory, June 6th.</p>

The ship was spotted as the bell rang nine times. The sound of firecrackers rose, and the cheers overflowed the air. The ship docked at half-past nine. Our country's athletes, who had been separated for two weeks, were reunited with their hometown, shaking hands and exchanging warm greetings. The scene of the send-off was still fresh in their minds, but each person's psychology had undergone a different transformation.

<p>Zhang Boling, the General Representative of the Chinese team, told reporters that the Chinese team's failure this time was not due to a lack of progress in their performance, but rather because their progress was not as rapid as that of others. He also said that he has already devised methods to address both the symptoms and the root causes of our country's physical education (detailed in an interview with this newspaper's reporter in Japan). The day of gradual implementation, collaboration, and hard work is not far off. Zhao Jinqing, the representative of the Association for the Advancement of Physical Education and the Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, told reporters that it is undeniable that the Chinese athletes' performance was not as good as others. However, their spirit and character demonstrated the attitude of a great nation, which was praised by people from other countries. He also said that after visiting various industrial factories, he had a profound impression: the Japanese are too eager for progress, while the Chinese are too slow to improve. Both extremes are not beneficial.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Secretary Xu's Great Contribution <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Xu Zhendong, the Deputy Secretary-General, handled all the miscellaneous affairs of the Chinese delegation in Japan appropriately and in an orderly manner. Many praised his diligent service and considered him one of the most hardworking and contributing members of the entire delegation.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Three Earthquakes Encountered <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The athletes encountered three earthquakes in Tokyo: the first on the 23rd, the second on the 28th, and the third on the 30th. The first two earthquakes were not major, but as strangers in a foreign land, they could not help but turn pale at the mere mention of it. The third earthquake occurred suddenly late at night, and many people were caught off guard and rushed out of their rooms without dressing properly, creating a chaotic and amusing scene.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Qiu and Lin Compared <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Qiu Feihai and Lin Baohua, the Chinese tennis representatives, gave different impressions during the various competitions in this session. Qiu gave his best effort in every match, regardless of winning or losing. The Japanese regarded him as a formidable opponent. Lin enjoyed showing off and winning but could not accept defeat. The Japanese considered him a showman rather than a competitor. However, Lin is young and strong. If he can change his ways and strive for progress, his future is limitless.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Filipinos' Misconduct <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The athletes from the four countries lived together in one place. The Chinese and Japanese athletes were well-regarded for their proper conduct due to strict management. The Indian athletes were also quite self-disciplined. However, some of the Filipino athletes often engaged in undisciplined behavior due to lax restrictions. Their secret relationships with Japanese women drew criticism from the Japanese.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Japanese Progress <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese dominated the tournament, displaying courage everywhere. Even in the football and basketball events, where they had previously lagged behind, they showed obvious improvement. In football, they had mastered the art of passing and cooperation. Their only weakness compared to the Chinese was in the final shot at the goal. In basketball, they adopted a man-to-man defense strategy, resulting in much better results than before. The Japanese spirit of fierce pursuit is admirable.</p>
<h3 id="e171">The Stain on the Tournament <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese organized this tournament magnificently, with grandeur beyond description. However, their excessive ambition led them to abandon fairness and means in pursuit of immediate victory. The referees' one-sided bias was met with dissatisfaction from both China and the Philippines and was a stain on the tournament.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Returning Home <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Of the more than one hundred athletes returning to Shanghai, a portion of the Tianjin athletes will be led back to Tianjin by Zhang Boling in the coming days. The South China football, men's and women's volleyball, and swimming athletes will also return to their hometowns.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Methods to Promote Chinese Sports <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Emphasis on physical education in schools of all sizes, national guidance by experts.</p>
<p>Football teams sent to Europe for practice, volleyball and basketball teams divided into North and South to train.</p>
<p>Zhang Boling's Remarks on the Return Journey (Special Correspondent Qian Hua of this Newspaper)</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Boling, the General Representative of the Chinese delegation, is known for his enthusiasm for sports. During several long conversations with Zhang on the ship back to Shanghai, the reporter discussed in detail the methods to promote Chinese sports in the future. It is only with the awakening and efforts of the people of the entire nation and the promotion of the government that the future of Chinese sports can be optimistic. Not only will there be no hope of victory four years from now, but China will eventually have no place at the Far Eastern Games. This failure is enough to make us wake up and seek remedies urgently. It is still not too late. Mr. Zhang said:</p>
<h3 id="e175">Japanese Progress is Formidable <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>After going to Japan this time, I have many feelings. The progress of the Japanese in everything is admirable and formidable. Sports is just one aspect. Track and field and swimming are already comparable to those of countries around the world. Even in football and basketball, the strength three years ago was like heaven and earth. This spirit of unremitting struggle is truly worthy of our emulation.</p>

<p>Referee Issues in the Future In this tournament, the lack of experience of the referees and their bias were unpleasant. Regarding this point, our country's representatives raised it at the Three-Country Representatives Meeting and requested that each country pay attention to it. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that when the next tournament is held, the referees should first seek the consent of the other two countries, but because this article concerned Japan's reputation, it was not recorded in the minutes of the meeting but was limited to the understanding of the three countries.</p>
<p>Fundamental Remedies Zhang also said that regarding the fundamental remedies for the decline of Chinese sports, the Association for the Advancement of Physical Education held a meeting on the Ryuta Maru on the morning of the 5th to discuss and decide on two methods: treating the symptoms and treating the root causes. The fundamental remedy is to formally suggest to the Ministry of Education to increase the compulsory physical education courses from elementary school to university, and then to have appropriate instructors responsible for guiding, classifying, and gradually engaging in practice. However, this cannot be achieved in the short term.</p>
<p>North-South Regional Training As for the symptomatic treatment measures decided on that day: (1) Football will focus on the Hong Kong and Shanghai teams for training, and in the short term, funds will be allocated to send them to Europe for competition to increase their experience. (2) Volleyball will be the responsibility of the Hong Kong and Guangdong teams to continue practicing, hiring excellent coaches to strive for progress with the latest scientific methods. (3) Basketball will focus on Tianjin and Beiping for training, and regional competitions will be held from time to time, with the proceeds from the sale of tickets used to cover the travel expenses of the two teams. (4) Track and field competitions will be promoted throughout the country. Training will be conducted in various schools. Efforts will be made to build more sports fields. Swimming and baseball are the most immature and difficult sports in our country. Building a state-of-the-art 50-meter swimming pool is extremely costly, but the Association for the Advancement of Physical Education should still try to find ways to make progress. For the time being, various sports practices will be aimed at the National Games next year, so that we can be more motivated.</p>
<p>Reorganizing the Association for the Advancement of Physical Education Someone suggested reorganizing the Association for the Advancement of Physical Education to form a strong physical education center. I also deeply feel that the Association for the Advancement of Physical Education is incomplete. The Association for the Advancement of Physical Education was originally divided into five regions: Southeast, Central, Northwest, with North China having a longer history and more unity. But I firmly believe that the Association for the Advancement of Physical Education must have a central force that can control the whole country, and Shanghai is the most suitable location. Without the Shanghai organization, the seventh session would not have been able to go to Manila to participate in the conference, the eighth session would not have been able to be held in Shanghai, and this session would not have been able to be held. Moreover, before the Chinese sports undertakings were hosted by foreigners, since the seventh session, they have been completely autonomous by the Chinese. It must not be said that there is no progress. Everything must progress gradually, and overexertion is prone to obstruction, so I advocate that we should temporarily maintain the status quo and take the opportunity to convene national physical educators during the National Games next year to discuss a complete reorganization. There are also those who advocate that the Association for the Advancement of Physical Education should also take provinces and cities as units, and I am afraid that it will be more difficult to convene the whole country, which is not a good plan.</p>
<p>Nankai School Sports Mr. Zhang said that he was deeply moved by this visit. After returning to Tianjin, he should take Nankai School as a model and start physical education training, making physical education a compulsory course from elementary school to university.</p>
<p>Hire good coaches to train in various fields and plan to build large and medium-sized basketball rooms, each taking next year's National Games as its goal, maintaining the name of the Tianjin basketball team, and taking a step further to increase the strength of the national basketball team by one point.</p>

<p>Enjoying the Scenery of Nikko and Yokohama, the Joy is Harmonious</p>
<p>The Separation of North and South Athletes at Ueno, Reluctantly</p>
<p>After the Far Eastern Games closed on May 31, the Philippine delegation took a night train to Osaka at 9:30 p.m. to participate in the International Games on June 1 and 2. Since our country's results were too far behind, it was decided in advance not to participate, so there was a tour of Nikko on June 1.</p>
<h3 id="e177">(1) Visiting Ryugu in Nikko <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>At 6 a.m. on June 1, the entire Chinese delegation of hundreds of people set off from the Japan Youth Center and went straight to Ueno Station. After taking a train from Ueno to Nikko, they arrived in Nikko at about 10 a.m. Nikko is one of the ten famous scenic spots in Japan. The mountains are green and the water is clear, and the scenery is extraordinary. After getting off the train, they took a short rest and had breakfast at the nearby Ryugu Hotel. Then, they went out to tour separately. Sun Sijing and other football players stayed at Ryugu because their legs were injured and they were not able to walk well. They said that they were happy to visit Ryugu in Nikko, which was a self-deprecating joke.</p>
<h3 id="e178">(2) Viewing the Living Horse and Visiting the Dragon Statue <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Near the Ryugu Hotel, there is a temple with a rough scale. The courtyard has a very large horse stable with a brown and white horse, which is majestic and tall, showing extraordinary quality. The leader said that this horse was ridden by Emperor Taisho before his death. After Taisho's collapse, this horse was left here to be taken care of in old age to show its excellence. There is also a room in the inner courtyard of the temple with a dragon statue hanging inside. It is said that if you clap your palms at the statue, you can hear the dragon's roar, but the room is limited to one person. Our crowd did not get a practical experience. I think it is a type of Chinese magic.</p>
<h3 id="e179">(3) Shaking Hands, Heartbroken Tears <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>After leaving the temple, male and female athletes dispersed to various places. Most of the small stalls made exquisite small wooden boxes. The opening and closing mechanisms were quite popular with the female athletes. They bought them one after another, and none of them were less than three times more profitable. The second was the wind photo, which was kept as a souvenir. At 4:25 p.m., the entire delegation finished the tour and took a car back to Tokyo. They arrived at Ueno Station at 7 p.m., and the North and South athletes also parted ways in Ueno. The athletes from Harbin, Liaoning, Beiping, and Tianjin took a car to Busan and went to Liaoning and Shanghai via Korea, while the Guangdong athletes took a car to Yokohama and stayed on the Ryuta Maru. The North and South athletes had been together for several months, and they were close like brothers and sisters. Once they were separated, they were all sad. The emotions of the female athletes were particularly rich, and some even cried out loud. Sun Guiyun and Huang Shuwei were especially sad. In the end, Huang Shufang cried. The station was full of sorrow. The whistle called out again and again, and I don't know when we will meet again in the north and south. Truly, there is no feast in the world that does not end.</p>
<h3 id="e180">(4) Consul Held a Tea Party <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The delegation of Shanghai and Guangdong athletes, led by Zhang Boling, Hao Boyang, and others, took a car from Ueno to Yokohama at 9 p.m. After arriving at the port, the local overseas Chinese came to the station to welcome them and invited them to a Cantonese restaurant for dinner. They were treated with courtesy and sincere enthusiasm. After the meal, the whole group stayed on the Ryuta Maru. The next morning at 9 a.m., the Consul General in Kobe held a tea party in the consulate to entertain them, and there were various entertainment activities that doubled the fun. At 10:30 a.m., they returned to the wheel and set sail for Kobe at 11 a.m.</p>
<h3 id="e181">(5) Situ Guang Won a Silver Cup <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of the 3rd at 8 a.m., the ship arrived at the local overseas Chinese Zheng Boling and his wife, as well as three representatives of the Kobe Prefectural High School Women's Volleyball Team (former representatives of the Japanese Women's Volleyball Team) boarded the ship to welcome them. Zheng handed over the donations to Hao and presented the volleyball championship team with a large silver cup in the name of the Osaka and Kobe Overseas Chinese Support Association, and also presented a silver cup to Situ Guang for winning a valuable point for the country in this competition as a souvenir. That evening at 7:30 p.m., Zheng Guoheng, the comprador of the Kobe Horan Small Public Bank, hosted a banquet. Mo Yinggui, the deputy coach of the delegation, accompanied him. The guests included He Shichang, chairman of the Kobe General Chamber of Commerce, Huang Shudian, a merchant, and Lin Zifan, the manager of the Tianjin Zhongyuan Company. At the same time, Zheng's sons, Boling and his brothers, invited Xu Zhendong, football player Li Huitang, volleyball captain Cao Tingzan, and tennis stars Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai. Cao Yanhua, Ren Fubo, and other gentlemen attended the meeting. They talked about the sports industry for a long time until 10:30 p.m., when the guests and hosts dispersed in joy. On the morning of June 4, the Kobe Prefectural First High School Women's Volleyball Team hosted a welcome party for our country's women's volleyball team. At 12 noon, they set sail for Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e182">(6) Peaceful and Happy Wind and Waves <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Since sailing at noon on June 4, the wind and waves have been calm all the way. Male and female athletes have been walking on the deck and playing various games. Xu Zhendong, Lin Shihua, Qiu Feihai, and Smith personally paid for the upgrade from third class to second class. The athletes complained that the food in third class was too bad, so they negotiated with the ship to change to eating second class food.</p>
<p>Among the staff, Zhang Boling, directors Zhao Jinqing, Lin Kanghou, and others were sitting in second class. The food intake of our country's athletes is very large. After changing to second-class food, they were able to fill their stomachs.</p>
<h3 id="e183">(7) Opening a Meeting to Decide on a Strategy <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>At 10 a.m. on the morning of June 5, the entire Chinese delegation was gathered in the passenger room to hold a meeting. General Representative Zhang Boling was the chairman. Zhao Jinqing, Lin Kanghou, and Ma Xun, who was sent by the Ministry of Education to observe the Far Eastern Games, were also present. First, Mr. Zhang Boling gave a speech, saying that the tournament showed the extraordinary progress and special efforts of the Japanese everywhere, but the lack of experience in refereeing was a shortcoming. Our country's failure this time was a good lesson. We should work together and strive to the end. Next, Zhao Jinqing gave a speech, saying that the most gratifying thing about this tournament was that the spirit of our great country was brought into full play. The most obvious things were (1) the discipline was solemn, and there were no facts such as the Philippines making various jokes, etc. (2) Although the referees on the other side were extremely unfair, our athletes were able to endure it to the end and never left the field halfway. Next, Lin Kanghou gave a speech, saying that if China wants the true development of sports, the education authorities must formulate regulations and implement compulsory physical education in primary and secondary schools. Next, Ma Xun gave a speech, proposing three points: (1) Please the Ministry of Education to implement compulsory physical education. (2) Find ways to train specialized coaches. (3) Promote the chivalrous spirit of sports. Then, Mo Yingji, the representative of the Hong Kong team, proposed to reorganize the Association for the Advancement of Physical Education. After detailed discussion, it was considered that the status quo should be maintained temporarily, and the reorganization should be implemented after the National Games next year. Next, they discussed the remedies for Chinese sports, so as to restore a considerable position in four years, and decided to carry out two methods of treating the symptoms and treating the root causes (the methods decided are detailed in another article, Zhang Boling's speech). Finally, head coach John Ma gave a speech, saying that although our country returned in failure this time, judging from the results of track and field, the athletes exceeded all domestic results, indicating that there was progress, but not as fast as others. We should not be disappointed and should work harder to make progress and hope to say less empty words and focus on practicality. The crowd applauded greatly, and the meeting adjourned at 12 noon.</p>
<h3 id="e184">(8) Yearning to Return Home <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>That night, the advertisement on the ship read that it would arrive at the Waibaidu Bridge Wharf at 9 a.m. tomorrow (the 6th). The Shanghai athletes were all delighted, especially Mr. Lin Baohua, who said that he could meet his mother tomorrow. He was very proud. At 7 a.m. on the 6th, it had already entered the Wusongkou. Male and female athletes were all leaning on the railings and looking into the distance. Before long, it was near the Waibaidu Bridge Wharf. The welcome flags and firecrackers could be seen and heard. The athletes' joy was indescribable. The so-called yearning to return home is like an arrow, and the reporter's diary also came to an end.</p>

<p>China-Japan Tennis Finals Begin</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Baohua Loses to Sato, Qiu Feihai Withdraws from One Match Due to Injury</p>
<p>Li Mudan Loses to Longkou, Li Xinghua's Match Against Kobayashi is Suspended Due to Rain (Tokyo Dispatch) After the Philippine Islands were miserably defeated by Japan with a score of 5-0 and obtained the right to compete against our country in the finals of the tennis tournament, the general vision was focused on Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai, who maintained the championship of the eighth tournament. The first day of the competition on the 26th was the doubles match between Lin Baohua vs. Sato and Qiu Feihai vs. Bui. It was held at the Sannenn-cho Stadium at 1:20 p.m. The number of spectators who admired the names of the two gentlemen and came to the stadium increased sharply to more than 3,000.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Lin Baohua vs. Sato <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Sato started the serve and won two sets in a row. Since the third set, Mr. Lin had a very good performance. In the third and fourth sets, Sato repeatedly lost points due to serving and smashing. Until Mr. Lin took the lead with a score of 4-2, Sato saw a turning point and won four sets in a row in one go, making a score of 6-4 and winning the first game.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second game, Sato still had the upper hand. Mr. Lin won two balls first in the first set and lost four points in a row. In the second set, Mr. Lin only got one ball. In the third set, Sato had a very strong and accurate push ball. In the fourth set, Mr. Lin won two balls. In the fifth set, Mr. Lin was completely defeated. In the sixth set, Mr. Lin won one ball. He lost with a score of 6-0. In the last two sets, Mr. Lin was very difficult to support. He let Sato hit and could not fight back.</p>

<p>In the third game, Mr. Lin struggled to his strength. In the first two sets, he had a great momentum to recover the game. Sato only got one ball each. Mr. Lin sent the ball to the rear of the enemy's court, making it impossible for Sato to save. He was worthy of being a famous athlete. However, since the third set, the situation turned bad again. In the third and fourth sets, Mr. Lin's posture of returning and saving high balls was excellent, and he won praise from the whole stadium. In the fifth set, Sato had a lot of strong smashes. In the sixth set, Mr. Lin's serve was extremely violent, but unfortunately, Sato hit them all back. In the last eighth set, Mr. Lin defended properly and repeatedly formed a tie. In the end, Sato hit back a ball with a high jump and smash, and he failed to defend and the result was 6-2.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Qiu Feihai versus Bu Jing <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>After Bu Jing served the opening ball, both sides each won a set. Bu then won three sets in a row, making the score four to one. At this point, Qiu used extremely accurate and low, long shots to counter the opponent, which proved to be quite effective. He won five points in six sets, taking the lead with six to five. In the following two sets, he lost due to carelessness. However, Qiu, with his rich experience, was able to rally even though he was at a disadvantage with a score of seven to six. He won two sets. In the end, Qiu showed some fatigue and was unable to run as much, ultimately losing to Bu Jing with a score of eight to ten.</p>
<p>In the second game, after Bu served the opening ball, he won a set. Afterwards, each side won two, making it two to two. However, Bu advanced bravely and scored three points in a row. Qiu also did not show weakness and won the eighth set. Finally, Bu won another set with an angled shot, thus winning the game with a score of six to three.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the third game, Qiu's response became more fierce, eager to recover the lost ground. His long shots were quite effective, but he was already exhausted. Therefore, even though he ran as hard as he could, he often failed to return the opponent's ball. He lost the first set after two tie balls. The second set also became a tie ball. Just as he was trying hard to resist the incoming ball, he suddenly collapsed due to leg cramps and showed a very painful condition. After medical treatment, he was still unable to move, so he declared his withdrawal in order to rest and then play doubles tomorrow.</p>
<p>Qiu's performance was excellent. His shots were very steady, accurate, and fast, making it impossible for the enemy to</p>
<p>predict. It is a pity that his physical strength was slightly weak and he could not withstand a long battle, which led to his defeat. It is truly a pity.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Chinese versus Women's Singles <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The first match was between Ms. Li Mudan and Takiguchi. In the first game, they chased each other from the beginning. After five to five, Takiguchi won two sets in a row with smashes, making the score seven to five. The Japanese team won. At the beginning of the second game, Ms. Li was listless and lost five sets in a row. It was not until the sixth set that the situation changed. Ms. Li was exceptionally lively and won all the way, making the score four to five. However, in the end, it was inevitable that she would lose after winning for so long, and she lost another set and was defeated. Ms. Mudan's performance was still good, and she was known for her steadiness, accuracy, leisure, and ease, which Takiguchi could not match. In the second match, Ms. Li Xinghua played against Ms. Kobayashi Yoka from Japan. Her hitting was not stable, and her ball retrieval was also unsuccessful. After she came on the court, she won four sets in a row. At this point, the game was suspended due to rain and will continue tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Education Department, according to the report of the Donghai Education Bureau Chief, previously issued school graduation and study certificates as ordered, only dividing them into five types: university, specialist, secondary, elementary school graduation, and junior elementary school study, and there is no model for mass school graduation certificates, please instruct, etc., and then transferred to the Ministry of Education for explanation. The Ministry of Education recently issued an instruction, saying that it has received the report that the Jilin Provincial Education Department previously reported the same situation, and that mass school graduation certificates have no regulations and should apply the four types of models in the school graduation and study certificate regulations promulgated by the Ministry, and that the study certificate is very short in mass school study time, so there is no need to fill and issue it, etc. Instructing to inform and</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education orders the phased reporting of matters, stipulating that the academic qualifications, experiences, and salaries of the education bureau chiefs of each city and county should be reported in phases. The Zhejiang Education Department has already listed and reported to the Ministry of Education the items to be reported by the 75 county education bureau chiefs and two city education section chiefs before March of this year. The Ministry of Education instructed the department, saying that the tables presented are all received and that the education bureau chiefs of each county and the education section chiefs of each city appointed by the department are mostly graduates of normal schools and have considerable educational experience, which shows that the department is careful in employing people and pays attention to local education. The list sent should be approved and filed by the Ministry for reference. However, the salaries are very uneven, with some as low as twenty yuan, which may not be enough to maintain their lives and make them feel at ease, so that they do not look outward. The department should find ways to equalize or increase their salaries to make them loyal to their duties and increase administrative efficiency.</p>

<p>The National Labor University is the only highest institution of labor education in the country. It has been established for three years. It is said that the university department was originally divided into two colleges, Industry and Agriculture. Later, with the approval of the Ministry of Education to add a College of Social Sciences, the name of the College of Social Sciences of the university had a problem due to the promulgation of the University Organization Law. The Ministry of Education recently issued an order to temporarily suspend enrollment. However, the university's enrollment brochure has already been printed and issued, making it difficult to suspend. The university's President Yi is currently negotiating with the Ministry of Education to temporarily allow enrollment. It is also heard that the university, in order to develop labor education, has formulated a three-year implementation plan with many aspects and has organized a labor education implementation committee and a construction committee to actively promote it in order to realize the above plan.</p>

<p>Daxia University purchased more than 150 mu of school land next to Sun Yat-sen Road in Fan Huangdu last year to build permanent school buildings because the original Jiaozhou Road school buildings were not enough. The first phase of construction started on January 5 of this year, including a large classroom building, a steel-concrete structure, 200 feet long and 80 feet wide, with three floors. There are more than 30 classrooms, laboratories, and reading rooms, which can accommodate more than 2,000 people in class at the same time. There are two male dormitories, each 200 feet long and 150 feet wide, each with three floors, which can accommodate a total of more than 1,400 students. There is one female dormitory, 200 feet long and 100 feet wide, with three floors, which can accommodate 400 students. The large classroom has been built to the third floor, and each dormitory has been built to the second floor. They will all be completed in early August, and all of them can be moved in by the end of August. The summer school and summer enrollment matters of the school are still held in the Jiaozhou Road school buildings. The new school of the school is all</p>
<p>The equipment is the most up-to-date. The classrooms are equipped with automatic electric bells, and an electric clock is installed at the highest point of the large classroom. There is no need to ring the bell or blow the horn for class. The desks are all newly made iron frames with Liu'an wood surfaces. Each person in the dormitory has an iron bed and a Liu'an wood self-study desk. Each two people share an electric lamp. In terms of water use, there is a self-drilled artesian well that can draw 170,000 gallons of water per day. A water tower is built to filter the drinking water and divert it to various places for use. All the equipment and utensils of the school have been carefully planned, and manufacturers have been invited to sign contracts for the undertaking, all of which will be completed in early August. All the utensils in the current Jiaozhou Road school buildings will be left for the middle school department to use and will not be removed because the middle school department will move to the Jiaozhou Road school buildings next semester. The new school site of the school faces Sun Yat-sen Road and is close to Zhaofeng Park. The No. 3 and No. 7 bus stops are all on Sun Yat-sen Road, very close. It is also heard that after moving in, the school will have several public buses to travel back and forth directly to the center of Shanghai, which is even more convenient.</p>

<p>The contrary fish is a special product of my lake. It is about four or five inches long, shaped like a river perch with round lips and a broad back. The belly is solid and has roe. It is taken and dry-fried with oil and a little spice. It does not spoil overnight and can be sent by mail. As I live overseas, my relatives and friends often send it to me as a taste of home. Why do I need to feel the pain of only enjoying perch in the autumn wind?</p>
<p>The fish is named contrary, and many people do not understand it. I have heard the elders say that this fish is also called Xun fish. The best ones are produced in Xunxi Creek of the lake. Every year in April and May, when the yellow plum rain rises and the creek flows rapidly, they do not measure their own strength and lead their companions to go against the current. Fishermen catch them with nets, filling thousands and hundreds, and if one escapes, it will eventually be cooked for people to eat. The book says that those who obey heaven will survive, and those who go against heaven will perish. This is why this fish is contrary. I specifically record it for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Yi Baisha's Drowning in the Sea by Bing <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Everyone knows that the old lunar calendar Dragon Boat Festival is the day when Qu Yuan drowned in the river. Dragon boats and zongzi are offered by the river to mourn. To this day, this custom has not declined in Jingchu. But who knows that in Qu Yuan's hometown, ten years ago today, someone also drowned in the sea on the Dragon Boat Festival? I will write a record of Yi Baisha's drowning in the sea.</p>
<p>Yi Baisha, named Kun, styled Yuecun, was from Changsha. He lived in Baisha Well and admired Chen Wengong of Baisha, so he called himself Baisha. When he was young, he read Zheng Suonan's History of the Mind and the books of the Ming Dynasty hermits, and he suddenly felt the pain of the race. When he heard the revolutionary anti-Manchu theory of the Min Party, he was overjoyed and befriended the Min Party members. During the Xinhai Wuchang Uprising, Anhui responded, and Sun Yujun was the governor. Baisha was in Anhui and organized students with Han Qibai and others to form a youth military. The Yuan-suppressing campaign was dissolved, and he fled to Japan and published the Jia Yin magazine with Zhang Xingyan and others. Yuan's was defeated and returned to the country to teach. He wrote articles for the New Youth magazine several times and also contributed to the Construction magazine. His works such as Kongzi Pingyi and Emperor's Spring and Autumn were all published in this period. Later, Sun Yat-sen presided over Guangzhou and advocated the Northern Expedition. Baisha went to visit him and stated his willingness to form a team to accompany him to conquer the bandits. Hu Zhantang and Zhang Puquan said that you should serve the country with articles, not go to danger. Baisha took a small steamboat to Chencun on the night of the Dragon Boat Festival, left a paper with a white hat on the seat, and jumped into the sea. Chencun is the hometown of Chen Wengong of Baisha. When the incident was heard, the authorities were shocked. The sea was searched for ten days, but the body could not be found. A pavilion and a monument were built to commemorate him.</p>
<p>Baisha devoted himself to the study of the various schools of thought and history, advocating Mo and rejecting Kong, and his actions were close to chivalry. As for the Emperor's Spring and Autumn, he listed all the chief culprits and great evils who had harmed the people for thousands of years in our country. He said in the preface that I read four thousand years of history and saw that those who harmed the people most deeply and for the longest time were none other than the holy ancestors and benevolent ancestors, while the harm of Jie, Zhou, You, and Li was quick and obvious, far better than benevolent government. Therefore, Zhang Taiyan's Baisha Zi Fu said that in ancient times, there were those who lived in turbulent times and were angry and made rambling words, or those who were not Tang Wu and did not despise Zhou Kong and were left behind, such as Zhuang Zhou and Yinruo Ji Kang. Their words were like turbulent rapids, all inwardly forgiving themselves and outwardly measuring the world, and they were not self-consciously. Baisha Zi is close to them.</p>
<p>Baisha drowned in the sea on the fifth day of the fifth month of the Republic of China at the age of thirty-six. His brother Peiji printed his Emperor's Spring and Autumn to be published.</p>
<h3 id="e205">What I Saw in Singapore <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>Singapore is located in the south of the Malay Peninsula, commanding the Strait of Malacca, the throat of Euro-Asian transportation, and it is the tripod with Saigon, French Indochina, and Colombo, British Ceylon. During my trip to Europe, I took a boat to the port and got a tour. The mountains are green and the sea is clear, and the chest is refreshed by the high outlook. Then, Hu Wenhu and Qiu Jiyao, the consuls general of the Tang Dynasty in Singapore, and the reporters from various newspapers boarded the boat to welcome them. The public gathered on the deck and scrambled to take pictures. Mr. Minyi introduced them to me one by one, and then followed Mr. Lin Fachu's appointment for breakfast at his residence. The Malay cuisine is full of exotic flavors, which are rarely seen in China. My wife, Manhua, found it difficult to chew because the taste was different. After the meal, several kinds of fresh fruits were served. In addition to mangoes, oranges, and bananas, there was also Luguoguo (translated) , a Malay specialty that is shaped like a walnut, has the texture of lychee, and tastes particularly good. The host earnestly persuaded me to eat a lot. During the banquet, Mr. Lin and Mr. Chu talked about the past and expressed their feelings, and sighed that the old comrades were fading away, which led to a sense of vicissitudes. Mr. Lin is an advanced figure in the Party-State, a famous industrialist, and has deep ties with Mr. Jingjiang Zhantang and Jingwei. He has made great contributions to the revolution of the Premier. In 1905, he organized the Tongmenghui in Singapore and used Wanqingyuan as the site of the conference. This was the beginning of the Tongmenghui, which has a very glorious and great history for the National Revolution. Mr. Lin has a rich collection of Premier's manuscripts, which is enough to cherish. In the future, he will publish it and let the world see it. Then Mr. Chen Jiageng came to visit, looking extremely humble, with a clear and thin face, and he seemed unable to speak. Because I did not know the Min dialect, I could not talk to him. After sitting for a while, I left and asked me to visit the factory at a certain time.</p>
<p>At about 10 o'clock, I drove to Johor for a visit. Johor is a small country in the Malay Peninsula, like Luxembourg in Europe. In 1885, it signed a treaty with Britain and became a protectorate. The people are lazy and their nature is decadent. I walked along Bukit Timah Road for 17 miles to reach the Strait of Johor. A causeway of one mile was built. This causeway was completed in 1927, took five years, and cost 30 million gold. The stones of the two mountains were dug to build it. There is a section of iron bridge at the entrance, with machines for lifting and lowering to allow boats and cars to pass. A military port is built next to it to fortify the sea defense. The great project of the Straits Settlements is the greatest of these. Passing through the Johor palace, the structure of the palace is not as magnificent as imagined. Mr. Qiu Jiyao told me that when Mr. Hu Zhantang came here a few years ago, he once built a real palace, and the contents and equipment were like a museum. He ascended the throne and became a temporary foreign king, so he clapped his hands and laughed. Today, the King of Johor is favored by the British and accompanies his queen (the British gave her a concubine's room to act as a concubine). He travels west to Jilv and is unable to return. After visiting his imperial garden, the green grass is like a carpet, the trees are lush, and the lonely palace wall is worth remembering. We drove back quickly, and it was already past noon, so we followed the appointment of the Tang Consul to have a dinner at the Chinese Club. Mr. Tang is the son of Mr. Shaochuan, and he has been in Singapore for a year, and his political reputation is outstanding. At 2 o'clock, we visited the Chen Jiageng Company factory, which is located at the intersection of North Bridge Road and Samba Wa Road in Singapore. The area is vast, covering more than 10 acres. Mr. Chen Jiageng kindly received us and explained in detail. The factory has a total of 5,000 workers, of which female workers account for two-thirds. The fund is about 10 million or more. The largest product is rubber shoes, which can produce an average of 25,000 pairs per day. In addition to selling to various provinces in the country, it has now expanded its foreign trade and opened a branch in the UK to promote it. If it manufactures tarpaulins, rubber wheels, rubber tires, canned food, printing, soap, felt hats, etc., it is colorful. It took one or two hours to see the whole picture, which shows the vast scope of the company.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Record of the Characteristics of Russian Literature and its Women <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>By Xiaochang</p>
<p>My close friend, Mr. Li Zihua, has lived in Russia for many years. This time, upon his return to China, he described the nature of the Russian people in great detail. Now, I record one or two of these descriptions to introduce them to my fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>The characteristic of Russian literature is its genuineness and frankness. This is especially evident when comparing Russian novels with English ones. English novelists express their own opinions and release their pent-up spirits. Although adorned with beautiful prose, the true essence of the author's soul is not fully revealed. Russians, however, are different. They are unrestrained and genuine, not only pouring out the author's true feelings and vividly portraying them, but also presenting the truth of society and its characters with honesty. From this, one can understand their energy and mood, see their nature and sincerity. The strengths and weaknesses can also be discerned. A single reading of a novel by a famous Russian author reveals the true face of farmers, criminals, and madmen. There are those who plot social reforms, those who oppose them, those who view them with indifference, those who admire the Orient, those who are enthusiastic about the West, and those who respect their own country. Although diverse and chaotic, all are presented with truth. The nature of Russian literature is indeed similar to that of English women's literature.</p>
<p>Another characteristic of Russian novels lies in their depiction of human emotions. No matter how excellent a work may be, if it does not portray human emotions, it will not be valued by society. What Russians admire is human emotion. It can be cruel, it can be vulgar, it can be fierce, it can be pitiful, but it is best when it can express human emotions. Therefore, Russian novelists value human emotions over law, religion, morality, and the hearts of sages. They meticulously depict the feelings of adulterous women and the states of mind of madmen, striving to capture the truth.</p>
<p>Russian women can be found in all aspects, not just in literature. When emotions arise strongly, they truly desire to put them into practice. If they cannot put them into practice, they transform into melancholy. This is the common trait of women and also the common trait of Russians. According to reports, many great Russian scientists are women, many great literary figures are women, and even in politics, religion, and party movements, there are many women. It can be said that the nature of the Russian people is indeed close to that of women.</p>

<p>The National Revolutionary Army Orphans' School, located outside Zhongshan Gate in the capital city of Nanjing, held its third relatives' meeting on the afternoon of May 31st. As one of the family members, I was fortunate enough to participate in this grand event. Therefore, I will record the proceedings of the meeting with my pen.</p>
<p>History and Content of the School: After establishing the capital, the central government, deeply concerned with the achievements of the martyrs, specifically established this school in the winter of the seventeenth year to educate and nurture their orphans. The purpose is noble and sufficient to comfort the heroic souls. A preparatory committee was established to manage and construct the school, overseeing its completion. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Cai Yuanpei, and eight others served as committee members. Madam Soong Ching-ling is the principal. Initially, the school was located in Dacang Garden in the city. The school buildings were insufficient, so land was purchased near Sifangcheng to build more than twenty school buildings, which can accommodate two to four hundred students. Currently, there are primary and secondary school departments and a vocational department. The monthly expenses are allocated by the Ministry of Finance. All student clothing, food, and supplies are provided by the school. The school has facilities such as a hospital and a library. The dormitories and cleaning rooms are very well-maintained. In terms of teaching, emphasis is placed on practicality. Therefore, the secondary school department has vocational and agricultural courses, continuing through winter and summer. Students can continue their studies. In addition to reading, students are responsible for all daily work in the school. This is the characteristic of the school. The school is located in a quiet area with excellent air quality. Therefore, studying here is not only academically beneficial but also beneficial to the body. In the future, serving the country and society will surely bring comfort to the martyrs in the afterlife.</p>
<p>Grand Opening Ceremony: At one o'clock in the afternoon, relatives, guarantors, teachers, staff, and students of the entire school, totaling over five hundred people, attended the meeting. First, Ms. Zhang Shengyi, the director of school affairs, and the teachers led the guests to visit the school buildings and the achievement exhibitions. There were over a thousand pieces of exhibited achievements, a dazzling array of achievements rarely seen in primary and secondary schools. The silkworm cocoons and various specimens from the agricultural science department were particularly excellent. After the visit, the meeting began. Director Zhang delivered a school affairs report, followed by student performances. There were ten items, including Butterfly and Remembering Jinling, mostly dances. The sound of the piano never ceased. Next was the performance of The God of Peace, depicting the tragic story of the May Thirtieth Movement. It greatly enhanced patriotic spirit. The performances by the primary school students, full of childlike innocence, were especially endearing. After the performances, there were speeches by family members, followed by refreshments and photographs before the event concluded.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Finance: Speculation in Gold Rises Again <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Rumors of Relaxation of Restrictions on Spot Exports</p>
<p>Erratic Fluctuations Make It Hard to Predict</p>
<p>Result: Rose Eight Taels and Eight Mace</p>
<p>Confusing Fluctuations, Initial Drop Followed by Rise: Yesterday's gold market was exceptionally confusing, with erratic fluctuations and significant volatility. There were often twists and turns of six or seven taels, changing rapidly and leaving speculators unprepared. Foreign exchange, on the other hand, widened by five points, weakening internally but turning firm. Banks slightly increased their intake, while trading among dealers remained small, likely due to excessive volatility that was almost too fast to react to. However, Fuchang, Yuancheng Yong, and others made some purchases, while Wanxing, Shunli, Zhifeng Yong, and others had inconsistent supply. The market opened low in the morning, reflecting the impact of the large-scale reduction in positions. It then briefly broke the 70-tael level, plummeting to 72.5 taels. Afterwards, buyers became active, and the momentum improved. Rumors spread that the National Government was planning to relax restrictions on spot exports, causing excitement and reduced supply. The market jumped by over ten taels, breaking through 90 taels, reaching 93.5 taels. In the afternoon, it fell sharply by four or five taels. Subsequently, Wanxing, Hengxing, Shunli, and others bought, while Fuchang slightly reduced its holdings. Foreign exchange was stable, and prices only fluctuated by three or four taels. Later, within the 90-tael range...</p>
<p>Silver Prices Suddenly Rise, Opening Lower: British silver suddenly rose by 15/16, with the forward price increasing by 7/8. Silver prices soared by 0.1252. The opening price for May was 573.5 taels, then fell by 6.5 taels. The market jumped from 72.5 taels to 80 taels, driven by Fuchang, Yuancheng Yong, and other leading firms. One purchase would cause the price to rise. When the London fixing was announced, it was listed at 77 taels, an increase of one penny. U.S. dollars rose by 2.625 yuan, and Japanese yen fell by 0.09625. It then fell again to 75.5 taels. The domestic market was flat. Hua Bank sold forward British silver at 7 pence and 0.3125. Subsequently, Li Da Tong and others traded July contracts at 6 pence and 0.75, and various firms took the opportunity to increase their holdings, causing prices to gradually rise. From around ten o'clock, rumors spread that the cash export ban was about to be lifted. This rumor greatly boosted confidence and improved market sentiment. By ten o'clock, it reached 93.5 taels, and exchange rates also strengthened. However, retail investors sold off in response to the trend, causing prices to fall by six or seven taels. Around noon, it rebounded by two or three taels, closing at 88.5 taels.</p>
<p>Afternoon Closing at 88.8 Taels: After the market closed in the afternoon at 88.8 taels, it opened at 87 taels. Due to retail sales, it fell by three taels and then rebounded by four or five taels. At approximately 2:20, Fuchang and others sold, causing the price to decline by over five taels, reaching 83.5 taels at 2:45. Afterwards, the market was flat with fluctuations of one or two taels. After 3:00, the market suddenly turned bullish. British silver for December was traded at 7 pence and 0.125, and Mitsui bought September contracts at 6 pence and 0.9375. Then, July contracts were traded at 6 pence and 0.625, resulting in a significant upward trend, soaring by seven or eight taels. After 4:00, the general expectation was that previous gains would be sold off, and the market soon softened, losing four taels and reaching 87.34 taels. By the time the market closed at 4:30, it was recorded at 88.8 taels, an increase of 8.8 taels compared to the fifth day. The market was chaotic, and transactions were unpredictable. The highest price during the day was 93.5 taels, and the lowest price was 72.5 taels, a difference of 21 taels. The listed price was changed to 636.6 taels. Early morning pressing at 60 taels, noon pressing around 50 taels, afternoon still pressing 50 taels. Registration replenishment was uniformly 89 taels.

Chinese speculators were mostly in and out in small numbers to avoid risk. Trading volume for British gold was 200,000-300,000 pounds, with selling predominating, approximately 100,000 pounds.

<h3 id="e211">Sharp Reversal in Silver <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>

The near-term increased by 0.09375, reaching 16.75 pence. The forward also increased by 0.0875, reaching 16.5625 pence.

<h3 id="e212">Active Foreign Exchange Trading, Tight Money Again <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw an unusually large number of transactions in the morning, likely due to concerns about changes in the premium. There was mutual hedging among parties, but there was no formal liquidation. The tight money yesterday was purely due to excessive settlements, with insufficient funds to cover the payments, affecting the rise in the overnight lending rate. The large amount of settlements indicated a slight turnaround in the exchange rate aspect.</p>
<p>Overnight Lending Rates: (Foreign Premium) The morning rate was 0.0717125. The noon rate was 0.0717375. On the surface, it seemed to be 0.001 higher than the previous day, but in reality, the internal situation was still weak and there was no possibility of recovering to the original state. (Overnight Lending Rate) The market was tense in the morning, and the lending rate soared to 0.028, but in reality, there were few transactions and no competition. The situation was even firmer at noon, and the closing price was 0.03 with an added interest of 0.0156. The bank's listed rate was 0.011. Auxiliary Currency Market: The morning rate for Jiangsu small silver coins was 0.06245, the same as the previous noon. There were no transactions at noon, so the market price remained unchanged. Only 1,000 yuan was traded in the morning. The morning rate for Guangdong small silver coins was 0.0594. The noon rate was 0.059675. The price difference between the two markets was over 0.002, likely due to export relations. Traded volume was 105,000 yuan in the morning and 110,000 yuan at noon. Copper coins also decreased by 1,000 strings to 407,000 strings.</p>
<p>Silver and Foreign Exchange Inflow and Outflow: (Silver Funds) Banks settled over 5 million yuan yesterday, and the situation was tense again. Chinese merchants received and released over 2.7 million yuan. Foreign merchants received and released over 2.2 million yuan. Various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous funds received and released approximately 9 million yuan. Special funds received and released over 6 million yuan. Foreign merchants deposited over 2.5 million yuan. Chinese merchants withdrew 1 million yuan. Japanese banks received and released approximately 4.6 million yuan from various funds. Chinese merchants withdrew 1 million yuan. Japanese banks received and released over 12 million yuan from various funds. The head office received and released over 5.4 million yuan. Various remittances received and released over 1.4 million yuan. Cash settlements were over 1 million yuan. (Foreign Funds) The volume of remittance transactions in the morning was as high as 2,146,000 yuan. The volume at noon was 963,000 yuan. There were no transactions in banknotes in both the morning and afternoon markets, but there was a lot of off-market trading, with 230,000 yuan in the morning and 165,000 yuan in the afternoon. Bank trading was 450,000 yuan in the morning and 550,000 yuan at noon. The inflow and outflow of foreign exchange accounts between various banks was over 1.4 million yuan.

<h3 id="e213">Reasons for the Particularly Large Settlements Yesterday <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market has been unusually tight for several days, and imports of goods have been halted. Foreign firms have nothing to do. Uncompleted transactions from the past have not been quickly settled, and there is no need for new transactions to be settled. The sudden influx of such a large amount of settlements yesterday has attracted the attention of the business community. After investigation, several reasons were found: (1) The rise in the shilling and the fall in the Japanese exchange yesterday created a large difference. Generally, those who had outstanding foreign exchange took the opportunity to close out their positions and offset their gold futures positions to balance their accounts. Therefore, the amount of settlements for this item yesterday was quite large. (2) A certain bank needed to settle over 4 million yuan yesterday for goods it had ordered from overseas. (3) There have been many instances of orders not being fulfilled recently, but some are still acknowledging losses. The result of yesterday's settlements was that the total amount of losses exceeded 1 million yuan. The above three types of settlements all had a significant release yesterday, so it is appropriate that the quantity was particularly large.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Securities <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>

<p>The volume of trading is 1,200,000</p>
<p>The securities market here yesterday was quite active, especially for futures.

In the afternoon there were 7,500,000 yuan. The spot market was still slow but we did hear one transaction of 13,000. The early market opened with aggressive sale and was down from 1-2 yuan. Later the long headed continued to push and the customs preparation continued to recover and stabilize and with the exception of the financial market nine-six cigarettes and the continuous volumes remained sluggish, stagnant and generally unchanged but the other increase were much larger and the result was that custom duties each rose yuan. Remnants and others of the spot and future shares of continuos dropped and remained large.</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn Market Impacted by Rumors</p>
<p>Indian Yarn Factories Strike . . . Toyo Limiting Production</p>
<p>Active Trading, Raw Cotton Rises . . . Retail Investors Covering Shorts Lead to Market Increase</p>
<p>The yarn market began flat in the morning but rose at noon, with a firm trend. This was due to rising raw cotton prices and active trading, improving market sentiment. Toyo yarn factories, affected by exchange rates, limited production to maintain the market. Rumors of over thirty Indian yarn factories going on strike caused agitation. Retail investors covered their shorts. However, some sellers remained hesitant due to uncertain war conditions. The idea of short selling hasn't been completely abandoned. If actual sales improve, the market will likely continue to rise.</p>
<p>Increased Volume of Long-Term Contracts Leads to One Tael Increase: Exchange volume declined in the early market due to a weak gold market and hesitant trading. All months fell by two to three mace. In the second market, retail investors switched from short to long positions, and the market suddenly tightened, with all months rising by one to two mace. In the afternoon, news that Yunnan merchants purchased 800 bales of coarse yarn and that gold prices had rebounded boosted market sentiment. All months rose by five, seven, nine mace to one tael.

<p>Gold Market Rejuvenated… Buying Interest Recognizes Value Again</p>
<p>Bottom Goods Ultimately Thin… Market Price Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, overseas cotton telegraphed a rebound, but the exchange rate turned down, and the market atmosphere slightly loosened. However, various sources were short of supply, and bottom goods were scarce. Generally, people predicted that various factories would be short of goods, and Qingdao factories intended to purchase in Shanghai. Therefore, people's confidence remained firm, and some bulls even anticipated forty taels. However, Hubei cotton and some bears were selling off in large quantities. The cotton market situation was extraordinarily firm and rising. If the exchange rate continues to fall, there may be a temporary pullback.</p>
<p>Hubei Cotton Up Two or Three Cents Again. The Exchange opened with the gold market slightly down and silver prices weakening. Later, as the gold market improved, buying interest became fervent again, and each month rebounded by five cents to one and a half cents. In the afternoon, the situation became even tighter, and buying interest became more intense, with each month rising another two and a half to three cents. However, Shenchang &amp; Co. sold more than 1,000 dan, and there were also many buyers. Total transaction volume for the city was 71,900 dan. The closing prices for Hubei cotton are recorded below:</p>

<p>More Than 400,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Various Goods Down About 2 Jiao Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, another ship carrying about 70-80,000 bags of foreign rice arrived, imported by Ding Muwan. Including the three ships that arrived the day before, there were a total of more than 400,000 bags, mostly shipped from Rangoon. After this batch arrived, merchants' intentions were weak, and they remained in a wait-and-see attitude, so the market suddenly fell by 2 jiao yesterday. However, the cargo owners had mostly pre-sold futures for this rice, and there was not much stock in the market, so they were not willing to depreciate the price greatly and unload lightly. However, people's confidence had been shaken. Overall, the city paper was 8-9,000 bags, and the price was about 2 jiao less, it is said.</p>

<p>Spot Flour Has a Large Amount of Military Demand… Bulls Release Prices to Absorb</p>
<p>Standard Flour Exceeds Normal Limits… Each Month Rises Wildly by Six or Seven Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened in the morning with a good situation, but the increase was still insignificant. By the time the afternoon session opened, many outside bears were frantically covering their positions, and it was heard that the government was purchasing spot flour due to military rations. In this state of frenzied excitement, this unexpected business gave the speculators even more support to raise prices, and new flour gradually rose. Large factories stood by and refused to sell off, leading the bulls to believe that since the factories were not selling, there was no need to worry. As a result, during the current month, prices were frequently released and purchased, as if the rise in prices would be as unlimited as the price of gold. As a result, the current month rose wildly by 7 fen compared to the previous day, July rose 6 fen 2.5 li, August rose 6 fen 5 li, September rose 6 fen, October rose 4 fen 5 li, and November rose 4 fen, it is said.</p>

<p>Buying Interest is Intense… Bears Compete to Cover</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for wheat futures in each month showed a consistent and sharp rise. It is found that the driving force for this kind of surge actually started from the soaring price of gold. Because nervous people thought that without the small foreign flour wheat price, there would be no possibility of coming to China, although a small number of new wheat had already appeared on the market, the weather during the flood season was not seen to be very bad, and the Hubei gangs' thinking was even more firm and rising. The frenzy of buying interest and the smoothness of transactions in recent days are rare. Seeing this situation, because the big bears are thinking about making up for it, there are still signs of continued improvement. In the afternoon closing, as a result, June rose sharply by another 7 fen compared to the previous day, July rose 6 fen, August rose 7 fen, September rose 9 fen, October rose 5 fen, and November rose 6 fen. New and Old: The spot wheat market situation is that the standard has soared, and customers are gradually calling higher prices, raising them by another 3 fen compared to the previous day. Old wheat from Suzhou Qingjiangpu opened at 5 taels 0 fen 7 li, totaling 1,000 bags. Also, new wheat, such as Penglai Zhen wheat, was 4 taels 6 qian 5 fen, 4 taels 6 qian 3 fen, 4 taels 6 qian 4 fen, and 4 taels 5 qian 7 fen. Pudong wheat was 4 taels 4 qian 7 fen and 4 taels 3 qian 5 fen. Shuangfeng wheat was 4 taels 7 qian and 4 taels 6 qian 8 fen. Waigang wheat was 4 taels 5 qian 8 fen, totaling 3,000 bags, it is said.</p>

<p>Jian Bing Tightens Due to Rising Raw Material Prices</p>
<p>Recently, Jian Bing has been extremely scarce in the market because the Dragon Boat Festival has passed, but the inventory of each company is still thick, so the market situation is even more difficult to rise. However, the spot price of raw sugar has been increasing step by step in recent days, and the trend is quite strong. Therefore, Jian Bing is also tightening accordingly. According to telegrams from various factories in Xiamen, the raw materials have risen and they are requesting to hold on. Therefore, the companies here are unanimously shouting for price increases. Dealers have some stock on hand and are temporarily unwilling to add immediately, and are holding back.</p>

<p>Chaotic Exchange Rates Make the Silk Market Even Quieter</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in Shanghai continued to trend towards calm. Since the surge in gold prices, exchange rates have repeatedly changed, and the export industry has been greatly affected. American and Japanese firms originally intended to expand new factories, but the exchange rate shrank by several levels every day, making it difficult to proceed. The attitude of the manufacturers remained firm, and the market was suspended again yesterday.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there were no large transactions for black tea from Qimen and Ningzhou. No one asked about Road Estate and Native Estate Fancy Eyebrow tea. Only Pingshui Pearl Tea from Tongfu Yih and other firms had some interest. The market situation was unusually quiet. It is found that the reason for the recent market downturn is actually due to the soaring price of gold, chaotic exchange rates, and people's minds are floating, and everyone is holding a wait-and-see attitude, it is said.</p>

<p>Crowe Advertising Company declares: "Flit is a most complete insecticide, specializing in killing harmful insects such as mosquitoes and flies. It is 100% effective and extremely convenient to use. It does not contain toxic substances and does not stain objects. Spraying it on leather clothing, wool fabrics, etc. can prevent moth infestation. Its great efficacy far surpasses camphor. It has been carefully studied and practically tested by scientists and entomologists. It has been proven that Flit is the most effective in killing moths. The May issue of London Leather Goods Magazine published an article detailing the success of Flit in killing moths. It is said that there is only one type of moth that damages clothes in various places, and Flit is the archenemy of moths. After Flit is sprayed on clothes and wool fabrics, the moths can be exterminated. The insect eggs will die immediately upon contact with Flit. It has been found that insect eggs produce at a rapid rate. If there is a moth in the clothes within a year, it can produce five generations. Ordinary chemical insecticides all contain toxic substances and are not very effective against insect eggs. Only Flit is the most effective. It can also immediately kill flying moths. Now is the time to store leather clothing and wool fabrics, so we are offering Flit's magical effect of killing moths to all sectors. We hope everyone will try it," it is said.</p>

<p>The Xin You Troupe is putting on a difficult play series this time to improve theatrical art. The first play (Uncle Wen) was performed last week and won a lot of praise from the theatrical and literary circles. The second play (Dancing Under the Dog) will be staged today (the 7th) at the Central Auditorium on North Sichuan Road.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Introduction to the Famous Play (Dancing Under the Dog) by Zhang Er <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Since the Xin You Troupe performed Andrive's (Dancing Under the Dog) last year, it has created amazing achievements and broken all previous records in the theatrical art world. Even now, it is still in the minds of artists and dramatists with a very deep impression. Now they are working hard again to do a difficult play movement. (Dancing Under the Dog) is actually re-staging in this movement on the seventh of this month (today). Taking this opportunity, I will write down my impressions from last year and make a solemn introduction to art lovers.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the story of the script. Zhai Hanli is a shrewd and capable employee of a certain bank. His fiancée, Mo Licai, is a smart and beautiful woman. They have set a date for their wedding, and Hanli is excitedly preparing for the wedding and arranging the future home. Suddenly, a thunderbolt struck out of the blue. His fiancée was plundered by someone using economic means. Struck by this blow, he became decadent and evil. On one hand, he harbored hatred for the rich, and he wanted to steal a large sum of money from the bank to avenge himself. What about Licai? She did not want to remarry someone else. What's more, not long after the marriage, her husband and her children both died. So she ran to find Hanli. Hanli, who had a very strong personality and was unwilling to forgive, drove her out. She was extremely sad and her psychology changed. She also fell. She had money, and she could find some men to vent her sexual desires, but what she kept thinking about was still wanting to go to Hanli's house to linger for a while, to pay tribute, and to cry bitterly. The result was that Hanli's first goal was achieved. He stole the money from the bank, but the psychological changes over the years made him feel empty and unable to fill it. In addition, because of his immersion in wine and sex, he became haggard and old. He felt that he was unable to do anything, so he decided to commit suicide.</p>
<p>The source of the play title (Dancing Under the Dog) is because the protagonist Zhai Hanli is a very lonely person who does not have the leisure and elegance. The reason why his home has musical equipment is because his fiancée is skilled in music. He himself does not know much about music, but when he was a child, his mother taught him a simple tune called (Dancing Under the Dog). Even when he grew up, he has not forgotten it. When he was happy, he played it for his lover and his friends to listen to. Although his fingering was very clumsy, when he became decadent, he played it for his patrons to listen to. When he was sad, desperate and committed suicide, he played it for himself to listen to. It was played four or five times in the play, so the author symbolized the whole play's melancholy and depression with that tune.</p>
<p>Andrive's philosophy is gray and full of mystery. Of course, (Dancing Under the Dog) is also like that, so many people in last year's audience did not understand the play's purpose even after watching the whole play. My personal interpretation is that the play symbolizes the depressing emotions of the chaotic era before the Russian War. The protagonist's disappointment, struggle, and despair is the whole process of the play. Isn't Zhai Hanli's catchphrase (The door will close by itself) clearly referring to (People always have to die) or (Everything ends up being empty)? He also said, (I used to live, live) and (All kinds of pasts are there, all kinds of pasts are empty). This is exactly Andrive's desperate philosophy. The script also says, "Who is it that has not been born? Who is it that has not seen the light?" How he misses his descendants and longs for the indefinite future light of mankind! (The sun will rise at seven o'clock, how can I spend this flowery black night?) Zhai Hanli could not wait for the light of tomorrow, just as Andrive could not wait for the future light. What a sad writer! The play was performed by the Xin You Troupe, and the director is also the translator. Of course, the meaning of the script is fully expressed. Their performance art is second to none on the Shanghai theater stage. What I like most is that they create very grand sets. Although there are a few large props on the stage, it still feels very desolate. When Zhai Hanli's heart is fighting between the two thoughts of life and death and he is dancing madly on the stage, you can see that this person is as small as an insect and as dim as a ghost, creating a kind of tragic air that makes the audience feel that he really can't live. In addition, Mr. Yuan Muzhi's performance in the role of Zhai Hanli is exquisite, fully portraying Zhai Hanli's profound inner world, and implying the entire history of Zhai Hanli, which can be written with five or six hundred thousand words, in the four-act play. This is very commendable.</p>
<p>In a theater world that is keen on low-level tastes, the Xin You Troupe's difficult drama movement is indeed rare and valuable.</p>
