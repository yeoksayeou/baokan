<h3 id="c9">歐洲各國最近之政象 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>世界政治之運行。本不能一循直綫而無波折。惟其波折。或迂緩而細。或猛厲而鉅。則視其環境情勢而定。不能預料。民治主義之進展。可謂蓬蓬勃勃。一往無前矣。然而試觀今日歐洲各國。多數感有逆轉之象。是即政治進行中之所謂波折也。今日逆轉之亦象。一爲軍閥王室復辟之陰謀。二爲狄克推多制之盛行。前者不過餘燄之復燃。不久自易息滅。後者則信之者衆。尙未能測其轉至若何程度也。試略舉最近各國政象如左。</p>
<p>葡萄牙近發覺一推翻共和重建王朝之陰謀。前總理阿篤士前商部長薛爾伐等均爲主謀人物。</p>
<p>匈牙利王黨。陰謀霍伯斯堡王室復辟。擁立奥都大公。將有所舉動羅馬尼亞新王卽位後。政權操於王黨自由黨與國家黨之領袖俱贊成狄克推多制。</p>
<p>南斯拉夫之國民黨。雖反對獨裁然其農民黨前副總裁一派。則極力表示盡忠三家。内部有分裂勢。</p>
<p>西班牙全國已成立金融狄克推多制。西王授財長以特權。立陶宛首相狄克推多胡特瑪拉之黨徒。尙圖活動。</p>
<p>波蘭政局突變。史拉維克政府被推倒。畢蘇斯基組新閣。將由半狄克推多而變爲顯明之狄克推多制。</p>
<p>奥大利之棒喝黨。圖奪政權。要求任用該黨黨員。并解除社會黨衛隊武裝。其勢日盛。</p>
<p>德意志此次選舉運動。保守黨雖痛斥狄克推多制。然其他各黨主張與棒喝黨携手甚多。而决大利之極力鼓吹其主義。欲推廣其黨之勢力於各國者。則且日進而不已焉。</p>
<p>此種政治之現象。果僅爲一時之逆轉耶抑逆轉不己。而將與一往直前之民治主義。發生若何之衝突耶。則非所知矣。</p>

<p>馬孫二氏是日所搭爲招商之江新輪。江新爲招商四一等船之一。（其餘爲江華、江安、江順、）裝璜頗佳。年代雖久而行駛力不弱。是日。上午十一時許起行。下午二時二十五分已到蕪。蕪地各機關。早已接電籌備。市新公安局長唐紹臯。預派公安特務大隊百餘名。先期在招商躉船碼頭四周佈防。碼頭上亦加派警察二十名維持一切未至二時。市政籌備處主任邵逸周。縣長孫公明。中國銀行代表金主任等已陸續到埠。公安局長唐君亦戎裝率同特務隊長督察長等照料一切。二時二十分。舟將近岸。岸上警察軍樂隊樂聲大作。馬氏及其夫人女公子等并孫廳長皆站甲板左舷。馬氏一手倚船欄。衣淡湖色紗長衫。秃頭未冠。向岸頻頻點首。並時與其夫人談話。馬夫人衣白色旗袍。手搖鵝扇。態度亦殊安閒。孫廳長衣白綢長衫。架羅克邊眼鏡。長髮未加整理。反手立甲板上。離馬氏約十數步。武裝衛隊五六名則分立左右。舟將抵埠。乃陸續返艙。各機關官長首先登船。在大餐間中。向馬氏各一鞠躬。氏一一答禮。即坐大餐桌主席位上。向謁見者各有致詢。旋蕪皖江日報記者李勞三君。以及商會領袖等咸紛紛進謁。計共五六十人。舟停約二小時許。始在軍樂聲中漸漸離埠。馬孫二氏仍立甲板向歡送者答禮焉。</p>

<p>— 黄浚才</p>
<p>十五日本欄日皇后輪參觀記。言有貴族時髦西婦三人。天然肉足。不穿絲襪。據稱此爲西方各國女性之最時尙裝束。當時引起全部華人注視。行見滬上女界。爭起效尤云云。身體四肢。受之父母。本來清凈。母庸掩飾。且世人兩手常外露。兩足則穿襪。何手足待遇之不平等。揣西婦不穿襪之意。亦欲表示足部之天然美質耳。此種裝束。是否美觀及合於衛生。乃另一問題。惟我國廣州市見之已久。今日西方反稱時尙。不禁可笑。但羊城不穿襪之風。非倡於貴族。乃出自傭婦。斯微有間耳。</p>
<p>羊城富家。所僱傭婦有二種。凡任洒掃粗賤之役者。曰打雜。專司疊被舖床。侍候主婦左右者。曰近身。充近身者。多出於自梳之流。（粤謂女子不嫁丈夫者曰自梳）年華二九。身段功條。冬衣淺色藍布夏衣黑綢。每襲值十餘元。修短稱體。雅潔可愛。惟週年不穿襪。油氈底黑緞面拖鞋。足跟外露。嬌嫩肉質。映人眼簾。其能具此美觀。蓋有人工在焉。每日晨起。用浮水石將足跟磨擦光滑。然後施以宮粉。和少許胭脂。如畫師設色。配搭得宜。故呈潔白鮮艶之色。望之若出水蓮藕。此輩天然肉足。與西婦比較美觀。恐不多讓焉</p>
<p>近身傭婦不穿襪之原始用意。不得而知。惟考其工作清閒。則非因職業關係也。可以穿十餘元一襲之黑綢。則决非不能備數角一雙之襪子者。可見其初非計較金錢也。然行之已久。無人稱道。今西婦效颦。反動國人注視。大抵同一裝束嗜好。出於强國則曰文明。若見諸弱國則曰野蠻。比比皆是。又何獨區區不穿襪問題哉</p>

<p>— 黄寄萍</p>
<p>園游會似乎是很新的一個名詞。近頃海上各團體。遇到什麽紀念日。便柬請各界士女。到預定的比較幽雅的地方。如公園。湖·山·或美麗的村莊去游覽。使久居喧閙市塲的人吸收着新鮮空氣。調養心神。這誠然是很有意義的盛舉。</p>
<p>攝影畫報於八月二十四日舉行讀者聯歡會。預定滬西「麗娃栗妲莊」（Villa　ＲiroＲita）爲園游之地。我素來對於園游很感興味。尤其是從未涉足的「麗娃栗妲莊。」引起我好奇的心理。下午四時許。登車出發。車過梵皇渡站。至極司非而路底。渡蘇州河便到了目的地。穿過一條長約百米的綠蔭間道。踏進園門。折向溪邊草地休息。來賓先後共到二百餘其他百人都是黄髮碧眼。他們本是常到的顧客。我華人游者絶少。這次士女雲集。還算破題兒第一遭。</p>
<p>我們認定了座位以後攝影。划船。聚談。各隨興之所至。在河畔廣約兩畝的草地上。都給來賓佔滿了。我覺得像這種集會之中。女性最占勢力。伊們穿了五彩繽紛的衣飾。流露着和顔悅色的神情發出一陣陣的鶯聲燕語。確是調劑兩性間優美生活的好資料。倘使集會中純粹是同性的話。一定會减色的。那時更有幾位西女。穿着游泳衣。時時在我們視線中映演着。伊們划船。游泳或是草地上仰臥。或互相擁抱着。姿態自然。好像以豐美的肌肉。炫耀於人。來賓中也有不少是知名之士。剛退隱的敎育部司長陳劍　氏。也蹀　園中。態度安閒。想來也是高興園游的一個。</p>
<p>「麗娃栗妲莊」主人爲俄國可魯勒夫。菜畦隴畝。四面環纔。園中有兩方淺草平舗的曠地。可以拍球。花木扶疏。空氣清新。場西有溪。不與蘇州河相連。溪深丈許。水頗清澄。片舟盪漾。或入水游泳。倒很寛暢。中間一座小洋房。每晚都有西人來此聚餐或伴舞。不過物質上還很簡陋。這莊並不在租界而入口幾個門上。大書Ｎo.I　Jessfield　Ｒoad。與公安局編訂之「蘇州河北岸第一號」並不符合。又是工部局越界築路的證據。此雖細微之點。我們似乎也未可疏忽。</p>
<p>小報告　雲南路育仁里平報館以優待定戶起見。每定報一年者。除贈臙脂虎或本來面目一册外。每一百號中。並可得留聲機一架。唱片一打。茲第一組已經發表。按照萬國備蓄會八月份第一特奬之號碼末尾兩字。與定報單之號碼末尾二字相同者。即得留聲機器及唱片一打。此屆萬國儲蓄會之八月份第一特奬末兩字爲八三。查係爲淮南緝私水師二營所得。該報已向百代公司。購就唱機唱片。贈送定戶矣。又該報近來大爲改良。如趙鐵橋軼事。及火油貴了。及金潮關係之各稿。皆極爲名貴。并逐期刋登漱六山房所著之社會小說第一佳人浪漫史。尤極精警。至此項優待定戶辦法。現仍繼續有效。每定戶滿一百號。即贈酬一次云。</p>

<p>— 黎六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>事事變發生後。柏林政局頓呈混亂之狀。對於國會最後投票結果至爲滿意者。爲社會民主黨。因該黨提出之撤消政府命令案竟以二三六票對二二一票宣告成立之故。十六日内閣依據憲法所發出之新稅律因此不能發生效力。但興登堡總統旣付内閣以全權。此種新稅之實行。爲塡補國用不足計。又爲内閣認爲刻不容緩之事。則同樣命令將於下星期以别種方式再行發佈。據此觀之。國會多數議員企圖避免實現新稅之目的並未達到。不過在輿論方面。此輩議員對於新稅之實行。不論其正當與否。可以不付任何責任。專心致志圖黨於選舉時獲得民意之政黨。此實最要之事。蓋民衆常厭惡新稅故也。</p>
<p>將此次議會最後投票結果一加檢查。可知現在德國各派政黨之大概。多數方面二三六票爲社會民主黨。共産黨。國家主義派及種族派（Ｒacistes）等所組成。此各派政黨中。除種族派爲一種反動政黨。共産黨爲一種積極的革命黨。茲姑不論外。其較注意議會政體及民主次序者爲社會民主黨。至受囂震柏領導之國家主義派。則與意大利之凡西斯黨相近。醉心於武力政治。但在此次紛亂中。國家主義派之失敗正與内閣同。當投票時。該黨分爲兩部。有二十五人不聽器震柏之命令。而隨威斯塔（Westarp）人公爵之後。投利於政府之票。故此次德國國家主義派之分裂。已爲確切不移之事。吾人可以預料威斯塔系及特萊維奈努（Trevinanus）系之國家主義派議員不久將集合而組織一新右派政黨。器震柏在此次事變中之舉措。無異自爲其黨築造墳墓。其獨裁主義終不免造成瓦解之局。此次國會投票。該黨舉足輕重。本有與内閣合作之可能。囂氏不知利用機會。使本黨勢力加入内閣。反提出種種不能容受之條件。弄成僵局。亦可謂缺乏政治手腕之至者矣。</p>
<p>此次事變人多認爲德國共和。立憲。議會等政體之一大危難。十載以還。解散議會以謀政局之展開。此爲第四次。各政黨不能使政府穩定並實現一有利於國之政策。實爲議會政體之險象。布律寗内閣對於財政之穩健的改良方法爲今日德意志切要之圖。乃不能爭辯之事實。各政黨缺乏政治的勇敢。不欲於此必要之改革案中擔負共同責任。反逼迫政府至不得不抛棄其具體計劃或竟採取類似獨裁之最後手腕。實爲不可解之事。</p>

<p>這一天。席散得很遲。當然不能到百花底去了。到了明天。左詩晨到報館裏的時候。在許多信中。檢出一封異樣的信。那是一個小小的薄薄的紅籤信封。下面却寫着名内詳三個字。左詩晨心中默忖。又是誰請吃花酒了。因爲那種信封。一望而知是堂子裏的常用品。他們不需要堅厚雅緻的信封。而且外面寫名同詳三字。也往往成了一種習慣。同於請客票的署名地方。寫一個知字一般。左時晨那時拆開來一看果然是一張請客票。却就是百花里底懺儂家的。下面註了一個「三」字。那就知道是懺儂敎人送來的了。那種字寫得比拆字先生還要惡劣。大概是他們那裏的賬房先生的大筆了。在那請客票的邊上。却另有四個字。寫道。請來吃蟹。左詩晨見了這四個字。便又想起伊是住在陽澄湖邊的人。每年伊的家裏。常送來幾大簍的大蟹。分餉伊的熟客。現在又是到了持螫對菊的時候了。曾記得那一年。也是翠筠的一個客人姓殷的。是一個畫師。因爲吃了翠筠的蟹。他要畫一幅霜螫圖。掛在翠筠妝閣裏。翠筠連忙說不要。房間掛了畫的幾隻蟹。人家要說是個老蟹了。因此那位殷老爺改畫了菊花。我說這有點兒雅人深致。以蟹換菊。好比王羲之的以畫換鵝。現在想起來。伊的由翠筠時代遞變而到了懺儂時代。眞個要成了老蟹了。那天他把日常例行公事。怱怱的辦完了。得摸到了九點點的時候。便到百花底來。雖然聽說生意不大佳妙。却還是個樓上房間。有一個廂房。和一個亭子間。不過因爲不大有打茶圍客人來。電燈也不大開。自不免有一些暗澹象。懺儂躱在那個亭子聞。身上罩了一個淡藍竹布的馬甲。在做一件絨頭繩短衫。把一個玫瑰紫的絨繩球。塞在馬甲的夾層裏。見了左詩晨進來。半抬着身子。帶笑歡迎。說怎麽到這時候纔來。等候了你好久了。房間裏一個娘姨。還是從前翠筠時代的舊人。左詩晨記得伊是個吳江蘆墟人。暗暗想吃堂子飯的人。也和他們軍閥一般。不出山則已。出山的時候。自然的他們會召集舊部。都用他舊時的一班部屬。聽得某人又出山。自然的都來歸附。有時還有慫恿他們的舊之出山。他們可以　權攘利。這番翠筠出山。不要也是他們慫恿的吧。</p>

<p>新黑瓜子稍見回升</p>
<p>龍口線粉干、近以走場漸增、而來源反稀、價遂轉緊、兼之客貨亦報緊不鬆、趨勢更佳、昨開出六十包、價爲十九兩七錢、行盤因亦喊高、有售二十兩之望、惟銷方猶在觀望云、</p>
<p>新黑瓜子　自跌價以來、走場尙佳、號盤稍見回升、昨開出徐魁子三百餘包、價十兩○四錢、碭山子七十包、價十一兩、</p>

<p>廠銷不動···絲價奇小···尙無人問訊</p>
<p>紐約市場、　來各綢廠均以經濟不充、絲織品銷路呆滯、生絲需要大减、週一華絲廠銷不動、絲價續跌角餘、尙無人問訊、Ａ級滬廠經開美金三元六角半、Ｂ級三元零五分、類均有行無市、至本埠洋莊絲市、依然寂靜、海外生絲銷費日减、華絲開價雖小、仍無電轉、市氣沉寂、昨祗克昌進沔陽黄絲二十包、價扯四百四十五兩、</p>

<p>白鉛皮市面久趨冷落、標準價久無變、近二三日來天津帮蠕蠕見動、而異軍特起之軍需處忽盡量收辦、因此成交之多、幾與大五金中之繁銷品相彷、查前昨二日共買去一百四十餘桶之多、價二號每担估二十五兩、三號四號均開二十四兩、五號二十二兩七錢半、六號二十二兩二錢五分、七號二十一兩七錢半、八號二十二兩、九號二十二兩二錢五分、十號二十一兩、十二號以至最厚花色每担扯價二十兩、聞連日成交當以二號五號九號三種爲最興奮、三號七號等亦頗多點綴、</p>

<p>馬口鐵無論英美諸貨最近趨勢因客帮採辦寥落、故市况極覺清靜、幸來貨尠少、積存鮮微、故標準依然挺硬、計九十磅英貨估十四兩、一百磅十五兩五錢、美貨九十磅十六兩二錢半、一百磅十七兩五錢、聞昨日祗開出四五百箱云、</p>

<h3 id="c226">意大利的詩歌 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 易康</p>
<p>意大利近來的文學是比以前顯着突躍了、因爲在政治上幾年的平靜、國家元氣恢復、作家們得以安心的工作、雖然他們底文學作品、除了鄧南遮、皮蘭得婁外、是少爲人注意、然而無論如何、少年作家的勃興在近來是大大的激增了、</p>
<p>在意大利文學中詩歌算是最能代表意大利精神的、自從一九一五年的黎明運動後、詩人隨着愛國詩人鄧南遮底鄧南遮主義（d'Anhunzranism）而努力的創作、到現在已有了大大的收獲、不過在歐戰後詩人從外來所得的感興减少、在産量上大大的銳减了、最近、在意大利又有了一種詩歌的新需要、一個年靑的米蘭人的編者已經開始在印行「意大利詩集」（Colleclion　of　Italian　Paetry）</p>
<p>第一卷屬於拔拉惹幾（Aldo　Palazxl　Sachi）底詩已行出版、雖然他不是新的詩人、但是在鄧南遮後興志的詩人中、算是以他爲最能保持固有的形情態了、因爲同瑪里勒是（F.　T.　Marinstti）的友誼、他起初是未來主義者、而他實則是一個帶着很重的黎明期時代的神秘性的作家、一讀到他底時、使人不禁回復到二十年前的時代、因爲那時代鄧南遮也正在做神秘的夢、所以同時代的作家都墜入了鄧南遮主義的氣氛中、但是神秘的時代是過去了、在環境上是不容許他們那樣的迷夢、所以、到歐戰時鄧南遮放棄了詩人底神秘生活去到前線爲祖國奇鬥、那完全把他在戰前和戰後劃分成了兩個人、而且在他底生活中也開展了一個新的時代、即是第二卷的柏切里（ＲiccardoBacchelli）中也没有新的氣氛、文學味異常之濃重、只是在美妙的印象和描寫上是值得讚美、思想的深邃呈值得人刻留着深切的印象、</p>
<p>意大利政府爲奬勵新的詩人計、早前曾經懸賞徵求關於愛國詩人鄧南遮的傳記、現在、極力的屏絶黎明期的文學運動中的神秘主義、因爲神秘主義不適合於新時代的需要、而且在意大利的全民族上是不需再爲藝術而藝術的詩人、因此、政府對於未來主義之羣是極力的振拔、極力想把他們底豪邁蓬勃的氣質用到政治上來、同時、在全國作家都感覺到决大利没有新文學産生可能的時候、對於政府的努力、他們也很同意、或許意大利的新文學便在他們協力的合作中産生呢、</p>

<p>— 易康</p>
<p>在意大利現存的文學家中、最有世界聲譽而且在國内的地位於一切的、是要算以小說戲劇詩　歌聞名的鄧南遮Ｄ,annunzio）了、因爲他不僅是單獨在筆頭和嘴上吹牛的文人、而他是一個能實際的自己的理想而工作、爲祖國而犧牲的實行家、</p>
<p>在歐戰時、除了靑年派的文學家的極力的非戰外、在德國和協約國内的老作家們都狂熱的謳歌着爲祖國而戰、爲爭自由而戰、但是在德國的詩人荷爾茲（Arno　Holz）和戲劇家霍甫特曼和比利時底詩人凡爾哈侖（Verhaeren）和作「愛國吟」底詩人康梅耳（Enrle　Cammaerts）以及英國的基卜林、蕭伯納和法國的巴蘭（Maurice　Barries）和瑣萊（Andre　Suaies）中、也要算鄧南遮是一個身體力行的作家、他曾抛棄了創作的工作索加入航空隊從事於天空戰爭、而且架着飛機直到奥大利的陣地、向維也納城中的人民抛棄促他們反省的勸告書、戰後他又把自已的住宅捐給祖國、作爲戰勝的紀念品所以、在政府的目中、鄧南遮的地位是超於一切的人了、</p>
<p>在他全部著作中、最能給意大利作家以影響的要算是他的詩歌了、他底詩詞句絢爛、格調和諧　從他底詩集「食蓮花者」（Lottis　Eaters）出版後他不僅成爲意大利詩人底班首、而且立刻成了歐洲文壇的班首、在所謂意大利黎明期運動中、經過一九一○年到一九一五年的幾年中、一批詩人都追隨着鄧南遮、</p>
<p>在過去幾年間因爲政治的飄搖在詩的創作上是没有若何的成積、現在因爲政局穩定、而且靑年們也處着詩是歌滿意大利唯一的工俱、所以一個米蘭底編者開始印行「意大利詩集」（Collection　of　Italian　Paetry）、搜集的觀點並不完全是藝術的鑑賞、而注重在能發揚意大利民族底光輝的作品、在全部的選集中、對於頽廢的、舊時代的作家都加以屏棄、目的在對於那能興奮新時代的意大利底作家和作品加以啓示、</p>
<p>鄧南庶現在雖然是旣成名的作家、但他對於後進的新意大利靑年們是極力的誘掖、</p>

<h3 id="c232">武進謠諺集 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 增敭</p>
<p>伍受眞編</p>
<p>眞正的專心去研究民間文藝、當然要靜謐地找出許多比較可以逗引起探討旨趣的途徑、即如我們研究「童謠」或「民謠」、那般不妨採自各地的「童謠」或「民謠」、集合攏來、作一個系統的比較的研究、可以看出某一地的婦女生活是怎樣、又可以看出一地的人情風俗是那樣、在發現了絶對不同、或撮然相合的時候、却能在無形之中唤發起種種濃厚的興趣、那麽對於此項文學的研求也能夠得到至美而豐滿的收穫、這是必然的事、無論研究那一種文學、如果刻板的呆滯的努力下去、總不能有使人滿意的奏效、</p>
<p>我在最近又發現了這本「武進謠諺集」、實引起我異外的懽喜、因爲看多了所謂民間的「歌謠」與「故事」、現在讀了這本薄薄的雖然僅有三十來首的「諺語」、又深深地感覺到它另具有一種特異的風味、就如我們食多了美味可可的蜜橘、換一個帶有滯口性的橄欖擺在口裏咀嚼它一下、更來得更爽適、這實是人之常情、我讀了這「謠諺」集、便覺有這樣的感想、</p>
<p>「謠諺」在民間文學裏、其實也佔着重要的　位、這「謠諺」、是出自民衆的口底、比由文人學士手造出來更有意義、因爲它完全是眞情的流露、赤與的表現、其中的含意、大都是經騐中所得來的、如這序交中所述</p>
<p>「謠諺不俾是一種很可寳貴的民衆文學、並且是一時代或地方的社會心（Sociald　Mind）的聲響、換言之、謠諺裏頭所包含的、不單藝術的因素、凡宗敎、科學、道德、習慣、敎養等、隨在可以發見、因爲它的作成、不是一個詩人在深山窮谷之間、或關係了門吟唱得來的、是積着大衆的經騐與人情、即個人心頭舌底所要吟唱的東西、</p>
<p>上面一叚話、眞把「謠諺」的形成與其價值、叙述得異常的透澈而精密、「謠議」是含有深刻的寓意、向上的語辭是不能否認的、我們翻開這本伍君所輯的「武進謠諺集」一讀、便可深信了、原來諺語是人類經騐的結晶、它是「没有受過科學的洗禮、所以不能算是科學的原理原則、然而人類經騐的一部分、往往因没有機會組織成科學、所以單靠着諺語而保存、諺語雖不敵科學、然而也是人類經騐裏有價值的一部分」、因爲這樣、採集諺語實是與蒐羅民謠有同樣的重要、</p>
<p>這裏面、一共分二兩輯、第一輯是「歌謠」、計三十弋首第二輯是諺語、計三種、一、關於世態人情的、二、關於天象的、三、關於氣候的、每一首裏還分了許多小的類别、使我們一看便能知道這諺語是指何種事物而言的、可見輯者底煞費苦心的了、</p>
<p>坐吃山空、</p>
<p>勿磨勿難勿成人、</p>
<p>頭髮扎出、力氣壓出、</p>
<p>只有懶人、没有懶也、</p>
<p>豬睏長肉、人睏拆屋、</p>
<p>刀鈍石上磨、人鈍世上磨、</p>
<p>吃盡苦中苦、方爲人上人、</p>
<p>省吃省用省求人、三年爛飯買一條</p>
<p>牛、</p>
<p>惜食有食吃、惜衣有衣穿、</p>
<p>着衣看家當、吃食看來方、</p>
<p>寗買貴物用、勿要買賤物吃、</p>
<p>吃勿窮、着勿窮、算計不到一世窮、</p>
<p>在這一字一句裏、都有剌着我們整個的心、促進處世要能勤苦·儉約·養成向上的具有樸質之風的民族性、像這樣警世之箴言　在書本中實在不能找到、即使能夠找到、而且也没有如此流利有字句、可就自然地歌唱、引起無限的旨趣、在此、就是民間文學價值的底定、我們讀了這集「諺語」顯然與歌誦「民謠」時有兩種不同的風味、它有許多的確可以作今人言行的模範、它底内容是以直接經騐做背景、所以遺留到現代、還可以影響於現社會的、爲了這樣、再徵引一首於下、</p>
<p>人爭一口氣、人老心勿老、</p>
<p>寗死勿投降、</p>
<p>强爺娘、勝祖宗、</p>
<p>窮勿失志、富勿顚狂、</p>
<p>磚頭瓦片也有翻身日、</p>
<p>寗可餓殺、勿好賊手賊脚、</p>
<p>有志勿怕年高、無志空長百歲、</p>
<p>出門莫計路、</p>
<p>人望高、水望低、</p>
<p>好馬勿吃回頭草、</p>
<p>兎子勿吃家邊草、</p>
<p>這首諺語是說、一個人定要有豪勇的志氣、發奮創造自已、並且要且有向上努力的進取心、望着人類所有的正軌上跑去、未來定有無限的希望的、這都是勉勵的箴言、我們切不可把它忽視、無意識的讀了下去、</p>
<p>這集「武進謠諺集、」拿來作小學校的敎材、也無有不適合的、因爲它全是前人經騐的發揚、可以供敎國語的小學敎師的參考、以這樣的敎學方式來指導兒童、我信相定能收得外乎人們希望之外的效益、這裏所搜羅的「歌謠、」有許多是屬於豪放的、向上的、不易多見的美歌、那麽、這便是一本良善的兒童讀物了、希望熱心的小學敎師有所注意、</p>

<p>可解决上海之車務管理問題</p>
<p>車務之管理問題。爲近世城市所注意重要難題之一。即以上海而論。街道狹隘。車輛日增。是以執市政者咸重視此事焉。至於車務堆積之最大原因。乃汽車之停駐。居民亦漸知不應再取隨地自由車之方針。必也採用其他停車之妙法矣。</p>
<p>職是之故。如何解决大項難題。實極重要。試觀紐約城市。今已利用科學方法。甘德機械進車辦法倡造者甘德汽車停貯公司。刻正造就甘德汽車停貯處一所。可容一千輛車云。</p>
<p>甘德機力停貯塲所。在甘德機力停貯所。爾能得一最下層付車之收條。其地面層專作出納處之需。所佔面積寛大。並有甚高之承塵。而無圓柱以阻進出之便利也。當爾驅車至昇降機門前。爾可閉鎖下車。遂有管理員送上一索取支票單。及爾需車時。祇須移駕出納員室。進呈支單。同時電信機以記號通知管昇降機者。乃在二分鐘内將車交至最下層。</p>
<p>在甘德汽車停貯所。純以甘德電氣停駐物。會合迅速自平昇降機。管理一切車輛。所謂電氣停駐物者。乃輕質橡皮拖曳輪箍之標準量。用時放在車下。且將齒輪與橡製互聯機接合。利用四面槓杆。乃可任意前後上下。故管理者。不須離其昇降機之足處本位。而能收入停駐及交付一切車輛也。</p>
<p>汽車行之特色優點</p>
<p>（一）省時。車輛之出納。較以前各法爲便。主顧之收交其車。位在最下層即可。各車在所内。咸由電氣停駐處物置。</p>
<p>（二）省地。同樣大小之面積。而此法可多儲車也。高屋能容多輛之車。在較小價貴之地亦宜。此於商業戲館及逆旅等區。大稱便利。</p>
<p>（三）預防損壞—「在甘德機力停貯所。無手將觸爾之車。」電氣停駐物管理車輛亦可避免污點及油膩之弊。機車之疾行。自動機及電池之過分運用。以及輪篐與制動機之妄用等等。皆可除却。車輛停在鋼室之中。行駛正直—無曲彎或微傷之虞。</p>
<p>（四）阻止盜竊。無論主顧原主及車夫等。均不准踏進儲藏之地一步。車門機門等亦可隨意閉鎖。</p>
<p>（五）定價較廉。（甲）營業用低廉。蓋此種汽車行僱員。類須精嫻熟手。故用人較少。（乙）依儲存地位而計。則資本成本亦較賤。機力停貯所能使霎時將車輛在高屋停駐定當。如此。雖在寸金之地。而其車地之租費。亦必不高也無疑。</p>

<p>納許汽車此次參加法國之常年汽車比賽。“Your　de　France得到兩種錦禁。一係金徽章。奬其駕駛之完美及可靠。參加比賽者其數逾一百五十人。一係奪得著名之喬治哈姆杯。在雷孟司山上獲得高速度之駕駛錦標。得奬之兩車均係納許四百號。壓倒羣衆。於萬國汽車競賽之中。得此大奬。誠屬不易也。</p>
<p>參爲比賽者。納許汽車方面兩人。一係羅文氏駕雙發火六缸車。一係杜美氏駕雙發火八缸汽車。杜氏曾得法國之道路錦標。與賽者其所經之途徑。備極困難。而納許兩車卒底於成功者。自有其特長在也。</p>
<p>常年之“Tour　de　France爲世界汽車比賽中之最有興趣而動人者。在歐洲之汽車駕駛家視之。此種比賽比賽兼有浪漫及機械比賽。頗有舊日格列丁游歷之意味。公衆俱有全國汽車展覽。老派克山汽車爬升及常年印地阿巴力司快道比賽在雷孟司快道上所比之速率時間試騐。杜美所駕之雙發火八缸汽車。平均每小時行一百基羅米達。其獲得本年之喬治哈姆杯者。則每小時伸展至一百三十八基羅米達也。納許車易於駕駛行動優美。在高速率之進行者極安全。凡此種種優點。均有關於比賽者也。</p>
<p>之興味。因凡參與上述之比賽者咸都參加此會。而令專家評判各種汽車之高下。本年之比賽自巴黎之泡多梅麓出發。全程有五百基羅米達之崎嶇道路。共計八日之行程。最先遇者爲電哈維及立萊兩地。此項比賽又包括爬山。其地點在法國南部之山地。另有冷馬托開發煞車及其他各種比賽。雷孟司所賽者則爲速率而已。</p>
<p>全途中管理比賽之各站。均有專員責司其事。每日晨夕察騐與賽各汽車之狀度並沿途隨時評定汽車之行動。舉凡極小之缺點。如登山時引擎過熱。活塞不靈。轉航滯慢。駕駛不穩等等。均不爲專家所忽視。凡駕駛者所不免之各種缺。均經嚴正之批判。</p>
<p>凡汽車經過之地。隨時於管理之塲停車展覽。以供當塲駕駛汽車者之觀摩。此次汽車游歷比賽。人都稱之曰「春季汽車游歷展覽」。每日有千萬熱心汽車比賽之。在沿觀看並許判其優劣。　之去狄在巴黎大宮所舉行之汽車展覽更爲熱閙。納納許汽車因種種卓越獲得特殊之紀錄。在法結交新友甚多。比賽隊所過之各城鎭特約經售商多家。是亦納許爲人歡迎明證也。</p>
<p>駕納許車比賽之羅文氏。其雙發火六缸車。係新自廠中運出者。獲新紀錄之雙發火八缸汽車則係取自陳列室中者。兩車車身機械各部均係標準之裝製焉。</p>
<p>參與此項游歷比賽之新聞紙專家言。「全程困難之行旅中。納許汽車毫未遇到意外之行動平穩在在令人稱贊。在勃里司脫。舉行冷馬托開發時。一輛納許汽車於五秒鐘中行十基羅米達。而其時乃在冷雨之夜後。至於駕駛之便。彈簧之舒適。足令納許爲意想中之旅行汽車而無愧。」</p>

<p>年來各地于交通事業。異常發展。而尤以江南各省建築新路者爲最多。然在都因工程浩繁。缺乏良械。以致曠日持久。糜費滋多。本埠德商禮和洋行有鑒于斯。將由外洋採最新式之掘溝築路機來滬。該機前部爲蠶式汽車。蓋其前後兩輪。聯有極闊之板齒練。匐地而進。如蠶行動。故可登山下坡。亦可鬆地行走。有發動馬達。計三拾匹馬力。其工作則一面掘溝挖泥。而同時即以掘得之泥。築成魚背形之馬路。分工合作。一氣呵成。每天十至十二小時工作。可築成馬路三英里。約合九華里。而每日所需消耗費。如燃油機</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>油及其他一切開支在内。至多不過大洋三十元。似此則百里工程。需時不過十餘天。所費不到四百元。便可告成通車。核與目下以人工開築者。其時間與經費。相去殊不可計。聞禮和洋行爲表演該機功用起見。擬俟機器到滬。呈請本市工務局。准其揮地試騐。屆時并由該行工程師指述一切。各界育關心路政前往參觀者。該行尤極歡迎。</p>

<p>— 平心</p>
<p>在上海地方。車輛擁擠。達於極點。不要說行人提心吊膽。就是坐汽車的。擠在馬路中間。恐怕車夫闖禍。也常常揑一把冷汗呢。在下初到上海。歡喜租很漂亮的汽車。碰着那車夫個個神氣活現。開起車來。一路横衝直撞。要顯出他的身手。我那時遂好像衝進戰塲上敵人防線。危險之至。恨不得立廖跳下車來。向那車夫說一聲。朋友。讓我下去吧。這種驚慣。我是受不嚇的。</p>
<p>最近我租過一部轎車。好像是福特吧。情形就不同了。他那車夫開車非常謹愼。我可斷定經過嚴格訓練的。據說。他們汽車上。又裝有一種機械來限制率。這樣坐客更可胆大放心了。</p>
<p>我因爲有了上述的租車小經騐。覺得租汽車。第一要注意安全問題。至於汽車的式樣。一九三○年式好。一九二九年式也好。這種牌子好。那種牌子也好。没有什麽關係的。因爲汽車無論如何漂亮。他那照會總是白底黑字的。誰不知道是租來的汽車呢。</p>

<h3 id="e9">Recent Political Trends in European Countries <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>The operation of world politics cannot follow a straight line without twists and turns. However, whether these twists and turns are slow and subtle or fierce and significant depends on the surrounding circumstances and cannot be predicted. The progress of democracy can be described as vigorous and unstoppable. However, if we look at the current situation in European countries, most of them seem to be experiencing a reversal. This is what is called a twist and turn in the process of politics. The current signs of reversal are: first, the conspiracy of warlords and royalists to restore power; second, the prevalence of dictatorships. The former is nothing more than a resurgence of dying embers, which will soon be extinguished. The latter is believed by many people, and it is still impossible to predict the extent to which it will turn. Let us briefly mention the recent political situations in various countries as follows:</p>
<p>Portugal recently discovered a conspiracy to overthrow the republic and rebuild the monarchy. Former Prime Minister Atos and former Minister of Commerce Xierfa were the main conspirators.</p>
<p>The Hungarian royalists are conspiring to restore the Habsburg monarchy and support Archduke Otto. There will be action soon. After the new king of Romania ascended the throne, power was controlled by the royalist Free Party, and the leaders of the National Party all agreed to a dictatorship.</p>
<p>Although the National Party of Yugoslavia opposes dictatorship, the faction of its former Vice President of the Farmers' Party is making every effort to express its loyalty to the three families. There is internal division.</p>
<p>A financial dictatorship has been established throughout Spain. The Spanish king has granted special powers to the finance minister. The followers of Lithuanian Prime Minister and dictator Hutmara are still trying to be active.</p>
<p>The political situation in Poland has changed suddenly. The Slawek government was overthrown, and Piłsudski formed a new cabinet, which will change from a semi-dictatorship to an obvious dictatorship.</p>
<p>The Heimwehr Party of Austria is trying to seize power, demanding the appointment of its party members and the disarmament of the Social Democratic Guards. Its power is growing day by day.</p>
<p>In the recent election campaign in Germany, although the Conservative Party severely criticized the dictatorship, many other parties advocated joining hands with the Heimwehr Party. Italy is doing its best to promote its ideology and wants to expand the power of its party in various countries, and it is making progress day by day.</p>
<p>Is this kind of political phenomenon only a temporary reversal, or will it reverse endlessly and cause any kind of conflict with the ever-forward democracy? This is unknown.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance believes that after the nationwide implementation of the abolition of likin, the central government's abolition of the regular customs and the provinces' abolition of the consolidated tax will result in a reduction in revenue of approximately 130 million yuan.

The provinces can trial special consumption taxes and save the original consolidated tax expenses, which can total 30 million yuan. This is still 70 million yuan short. The central government has now decided to assist the local government expenses of the provinces for three years, with the full amount in the first year, half the amount in the second year, and a further reduction in the third year, so that the local governments have sufficient time to trial business taxes and reorganize land taxes and all local taxes to compensate.

<p>Palestine Report</p>
<p>Criticizes Britain's Improper Measures</p>
<p>Neglecting Mandatory Obligations</p>
<p>National Press Agency, Geneva, 25th. The report to the League of Nations Mandates Commission, which is kept secret, on the Palestine riots was released today. As rumored, it heavily criticizes the incompetence of the British administration and clearly places the responsibility for the riots on the British. The full text is divided into three chapters. The first discusses the nature of the racial disputes in Palestine, the outbreak of the current riots, and the attitude and measures taken by the British before and during the incident. The second discusses the methods of restoring and maintaining order, and the third discusses the policies that should be adopted for governing Palestine in the future. It is said that the current riots cannot be considered as a sudden occurrence in a clear political atmosphere because there were various indications and prior warnings, and the Wailing Wall was the center of the warnings. It is also evident that the people at that time were panicked and uneasy, easily triggered. However, the report vaguely avoids determining whether the riots were premeditated. However, it strongly disagrees with the compassionate view of most British investigation committee members who considered the attitude of the Arab leaders to be justified. It further states that the lack of British troops and insufficient police force are the main reasons for the spread of the riots, and there are several points where the mandatory power has failed to fulfill its duties. The committee cannot but express its regret. At the same time, it also blames the British government for failing to fulfill its obligation to encourage the creation of a Jewish national home and failing to guarantee the safety of Jewish lives and property. It believes that the mandatory power should integrate the interests of all ethnic groups in Palestine, study local economic problems, and establish close relations between the two ethnic groups to combine their interests and eliminate their hostility. As for the request to establish a free government in Palestine, it cannot be granted. The committee hopes that although the Palestinian administrative authorities have the necessity to suppress mutual hatred among the people, they should not obstruct the implementation of genuine construction plans. The committee fully agrees with the steps to prevent future disturbances.</p>
<p>The British Government's Response</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th. The British government's statement said that the commission clearly did not blame Britain for fulfilling its responsibility to establish an autonomous government in Palestine. Broadly speaking, the commission did not question the concept of future policies adopted by the mandatory power. The commission's criticism is largely based on one-sided statements, and the British government cannot agree to this procedure. The commission believes that the Arab riots were premeditated and carried out in opposition to Britain, but the reasons held by the commission are insufficient. Since 1921, Britain has provided more than 9 million pounds to support the Palestinian government and in 1927 guaranteed a loan of 4.5 million pounds for public works. Therefore, the British government is confident that it has not neglected its obligations.</p>
<h3 id="e51">President of Peru Resigns <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Capital of Peru, 26th. Peruvian President Leguía, who seized power by military coup in 1919 and implemented a dictatorship for more than ten years, has now been overthrown by the troops under General Giraldo. General Ponce has established a military government. Leguía has resigned from the presidency. With the permission of the opposition party to leave the country, he has boarded the cruiser "Galo" with his two sons, and it is unknown where he is heading. However, if General Ponce keeps his word, Leguía may not be able to retire peacefully. After the military rebellion, riots broke out in the capital, and the residences of politicians related to Leguía's government were attacked. In order to curb the riots, General Ponce declared martial law and gave a speech to the students participating in the revolution, promising to bring Leguía back and punish him according to law. Only then did the public calm down.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Lima, Peru, 25th. Peruvian President Leguía, after the revolution and riot by Elaguibel, originally intended to organize a military cabinet to deal with it. Unexpectedly, he suddenly changed his plan today and announced his resignation. After the announcement of this resignation, the country's order was immediately restored. The reason why Leguía suddenly changed his original plan was that when he was preparing to organize a military cabinet, he felt that the momentum of the civil revolution was becoming increasingly fierce, and he knew that pressure would ultimately be ineffective, so he retreated bravely and drifted away. Furthermore, when Leguía was presiding over the inauguration ceremony of the new military cabinet, the commander of the National Defense Team suddenly entered and interfered, saying that the public would never recognize such a cabinet. Leguía's joy immediately dissolved, which is why he had to leave.</p>

The Indian government's report on the Indian situation up to August 23rd briefly stated that some tribes on the Northwest Frontier proposed peace, but in several places, new anti-British tribes were discovered.

Later, two policemen arrested an Indian, a law student, who was wounded and bleeding, and had a hand grenade hidden in his pocket. When the bombs were thrown, a coolie was injured, and two cars parked in front of a shop were also destroyed. Shrapnel penetrated the car door, and a fragment was embedded in the tire.

<h3 id="e61">Recent Military Situation on the Jinpu, Longhai, and Pinghan Lines <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Since the Central Army recaptured Jinan, the fighting on the Jinpu Line has come to an end. The Longhai Line has also been very quiet recently, and there has been no fierce fighting on the Pinghan Line. According to military sources, the Central Army should be able to resolve the enemy forces on these three lines in one go during their defeat. Commander-in-Chief Jiang, in order to complete peaceful reunification, telegraphed the National Government on the 22nd, stating that since the main forces of Feng and Yan have been defeated and the rebel army has completely disintegrated, it is hoped that the Central Government will show leniency and give the enemy a chance to reform. He plans to reissue a proclamation, admonishing the enemy generals and soldiers, that if they can be righteous and kill their relatives, capture and deliver Yan and Feng, and come back to surrender, they will all be given considerable rewards and equal treatment, so that they can unite and avoid giving the Communist Party and the reorganization faction an opportunity. He also telegraphed Fang Benren, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Qun, etc., who were staying in Shenyang, to Zhang Xueliang, urging the enemy generals to quickly wake up, so as to shorten the war period and alleviate the people's suffering. If the proclamation is ineffective, a thorough purge will be carried out. Therefore, on the 21st and 22nd, Gao Lingbo, Shao Lizi, Liu Zhi, Xia Douyin, Yang Shengzhi, etc., came to Xuzhou from Guide and Jinan respectively for a short rest. I interviewed various important people separately. According to Gao, the enemy forces on the Longhai Line had been attacking our left flank positions with all their strength for ten days since the sixth, but they were all defeated by our army and suffered heavy losses. The main force has retreated to Lanfeng, and our flank has overtaken Neihuang. At the moment our disposition on the Longhai Line has been finalized and together with Pinghan Line we will thoroughlly resolve the remaining enemies. The battle situation in eastern Henan is no longer a problem. Xia stated that after our army captured Jinan, Jiang Guangnai had directed a part of the army to cross the river to pursue the enemy, and Han Fuju had also arrived in Jinan to take responsibility for security. The Jin army suffered about three-fifths of its losses south of the Yellow River this time, which can be said to be a heavy blow. Our plans are set and we can clear the enemy in Hebei. The remnant enemies in Suan, Anfei, Feicheng, Wenshang, and Gaomi are disarming separately. Shao stated that after the Central Army defeated the enemy on the Longhai, Jinpu, and Pinghan lines, in order to ease the war situation and order the enemy to return, it has temporarily stopped pushing. However, with the war situation at this point, the main force of the enemy has been resolved by more than half. The goal of the war was originally not to occupy territory, but to eliminate the enemy army. The Jinpu Line has now been consolidated, and the Longhai and Pinghan lines also have precise plans. It is estimated that the Feng army can be resolved in the shortest possible time, and the war situation can be ended quickly. In recent days, the various important people in Xuzhou have been very relaxed. It is reported that Gao, Shao, Liu, Xia, Yang, etc., will go west tomorrow, and the western war situation will probably become more expanded. (24th)</p>

<p>Hankou Correspondence: This time, the Wuhan Headquarters convened a pacification conference for the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. Each provincial government must be attended by the Director of Civil Affairs. Wu Xingya, Director of Civil Affairs of Hubei Province and Acting Chairman, is currently drafting a proposal to be submitted for discussion at the meeting. I met Wu today (23rd) at his private residence and asked him for his opinion on pacification. Wu’s conversation was as follows: The three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi have always been areas where bandits and communists congregate. The disturbances of Peng and Huang in Hunan, the disturbances of He and Kuang in Hubei, and the disturbances of Zhu and Mao in Jiangxi have not been eliminated for a long time. Although the comings and goings of bandits and communists are erratic and difficult to suppress, the provincial boundaries are limited and there are many barriers, which is also one of the biggest reasons. This time, when the Communist bandits took advantage of the Central Government's efforts to suppress the rebellion, they launched a large-scale attack, and the remnants of the Feng-Yan warlords and the Gui clique also dispatched partisans to collude with the bandits, resulting in the Changsha Incident. Rumors also spread simultaneously in Hubei and Jiangxi provinces. Fortunately, the generals heard the order and the security was effective. Changsha was recaptured and the three provinces were safe again. In order to eradicate the root causes, the Central Government specially appointed Director He of the Headquarters to be responsible for suppressing the Communist bandits in the three provinces. Director He then decided to convene a pacification conference for the three provinces, bringing together the party, government, and military leaders of the three provinces to jointly discuss a thorough method of eliminating the Communist bandits, so that the people of the three provinces could escape the water and fire and ascend to the throne. The provincial government received a telegram from the headquarters the day before yesterday, and immediately delegated a brother to represent it to attend. It is currently drafting a proposal and compiling all the regulations and files related to pacification from the past to submit to the conference for selection, and then the headquarters will decide on the entire method and implement it consistently. I believe that this conference will have good results. As for the banditry in Hubei Province, the most severe area is southern Hubei. Hong Lake in Jianli is the nest of the Communist bandits. Recently, after the hard work of the newly compiled Fifth Division under Gong Bingfan, the bandit nest has been destroyed. The remaining Communist bandits have fled to Mianyang and other places. There are also a few Communist bandits in the Tongshan area. Once the entire method of the headquarters is decided, the three provinces can be completely suppressed at the same time. However, in the eastern part of Hubei, the counties of Huangmei, Guangji, and Zhanchun are adjacent to Susong, Yinghuo in Anhui Province, and in the northern part of Hubei, the areas of Sui, Zao, and Guanghua are adjacent to Nanyang and other counties in Henan Province. The comings and goings of the Communist bandits are more difficult to suppress. My brother has previously expressed the opinion that Anhui and Henan provinces should also be included in the joint defense zone. I will still present this proposition to the conference. Even if it is not included in the joint defense zone, we should still assist each other to jointly eradicate the bandit roots. The Central Government is advancing simultaneously on the Jinpu, Longhai, and Pinghan lines, and the military operations to suppress the rebellion can be said to have come to an end. I believe that troops can be transferred to assist the three provinces in suppressing bandits. However, the number and route of the troops to be transferred still need to be considered before a decision can be made. However, this is still a superficial solution. In the future, there must be a fundamental solution. The army's suppression of bandits can only eliminate the existing Communist bandits, but it cannot ensure long-term security or prevent their resurgence. Therefore, the fundamental solution must be followed by land reform after the suppression of bandits, and the refugees must be comforted and industries must be developed so that there are no unemployed people in the area, and the Communist bandits have no chance of regeneration. In terms of the current situation in the counties of this province, in order to solve the people's livelihood problem, in addition to allowing farmers to live in peace, small industries must also be developed to provide a place for refugees to settle down. This cannot be promoted without a wise, virtuous, and diligent county magistrate. My brother, being in my position, should draft concrete plans and proceed step by step to comfort the hopes of the elders in my hometown. (23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e63">He Jian's Methods for Preventing and Suppressing the Communist Party <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Burning Mountains and Forests to Eradicate Bandit Roots</p>
<p>Allowing People to Kill Communists</p>
<p>Building Fortresses Around Changsha</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: He Jian set out to pursue the Communist army a few days ago and entered Liucheng on the 12th. He is advancing towards Dongmen City, which belongs to Liu. The remaining bandits are fleeing towards Gugang and the border between Hunan and Jiangxi. However, that area has always been a Communist bandit stronghold with steep mountains and deep forests, making it difficult to suppress. He Jian plans to set fire to the deep mountains and forests in the Jiujidong, Pingyangshan, and Qingku areas to eradicate bandit roots. Yesterday, he sent someone back to the province to purchase and transport gunpowder to burn them.</p>
<p>In order to eradicate the Communist bandits, He Jian recently stipulated methods for investigating and publicizing to the people. The announcement is as follows: "Announcement: In view of the rampant Communist bandits, the heavens and the earth are in darkness. Alas, my Pingliu, suffering the most. This Commander-in-Chief, in accordance with the purpose of eliminating violence and securing the good, and in order to plow the nests and sweep the dens, has gathered a large army to destroy those ugly crowds and eliminate this dynasty's food. Responsibility is on my humble self. However, the great chaos is roughly settled, and the remaining atmosphere needs to be pacified. It is impossible to eliminate hidden dangers and cut off the source of chaos without the joint cooperation of the army and the people. Therefore, the following methods have been stipulated for compliance: (1) Local people are allowed to automatically arrest and kill Communist bandits and Red Army soldiers who are in groups or have obvious signs. (2) Captured or picked up Communist bandit guns should be handed over to this department for separate rewards and not hidden privately. (3) Communist bandits are defeated, and it is inevitable that they will flee in all directions. Local Baojia should supervise all industries, shops, and households to conduct a thorough search within three days to cut off the source of chaos. (4) Generous rewards will be given for capturing or killing important bandit criminals. If there are casualties due to capturing bandits, compensation will be given separately. (5) Local hooligans, ruffians, and all those who are attached to the chaos should write down what they know and report as much as possible to make up for what the government's ears and eyes cannot reach, but they must not falsely accuse others out of suspicion. (6) If a person is known to be a bandit criminal or is suspected of being attached to the chaos and does not immediately try to arrest him, allowing him to escape or concealing the report, if it is reported by others and verified to be true, he will be convicted of harboring Communist bandits. Regarding the above items, I hope that you merchants and people will fear the destruction of the enemy and do your best to eliminate evil. Comply with them earnestly and seek self-defense together. This Commander-in-Chief has high hopes."</p>
<p>Since Changsha was destroyed, although provincial and municipal transportation is said to be convenient, it has lost its barrier in military terms. Recently, He Jian has specially planned to build a permanent fortress in Changsha. An advisor has surveyed and drawn the plans, and He Yingqin has reviewed them. He Jian has appointed senior advisor Liu Zijian to manage the matter and ordered the Changsha County Government to convene all groups in the province, ordering each group to send ten earthworkers. The headquarters will pay each person seven jiao per day. More than a thousand earthworkers have been recruited and are expected to complete the task in ten days. The order is as follows: (1) This headquarters needs a large number of earthworkers to consolidate the provincial capital and build fortresses. The county magistrate should immediately convene the city and suburban areas and the various groups near the fortress line to inform them of the great righteousness and levy ten soldiers from each group, who will be responsible for by the leaders of each group, delivering them all before 12:00 noon on the 15th. (2) Each group will divide the area by itself, with every ten groups forming a unit and electing one unit leader to manage the food, lodging, and work matters of one hundred workers. (3) All expenses for the civilians will be managed and distributed by the headquarters through the designated personnel, and transferred to each unit and distributed to each civilian. (4) All civilians should bring their own hoes, sieves, and other tools. The headquarters will issue seven jiao for food and work for each person every day. (5) Report the compliance situation. The matter is important. Do not delay even for a moment. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Suppressing Bandits in Various Counties of Guangdong Province <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Army and Navy Forces Jointly Suppress Bandits in Counties. Guangzhou Correspondence: Taking advantage of the large forces entering Guangxi, Guangdong bandits and communists have been stirring up trouble. Around the Beijiang area, on the 15th, a group of bandits attempted to attack Huangcun station (under Yingde County) near Hetou. Fortunately, the local militia discovered it early and repelled the bandits with a divided defense. On the 16th, Zhouwu Village, located seven or eight miles from Hetou, was also raided by more than a hundred bandits, who looted many farm cattle and livestock. They also emptied the village of valuables and kidnapped more than twenty men and women for ransom. In the Xijiang area, piracy is rampant. A few days ago, the Yongsheng ferry traveling the route from the province to Jiangxi, was bombed by bandits in Weiyong, Chencun, resulting in more than forty passenger casualties. Recently, nine more bodies have been recovered, a grim scene. Not a week after the bombing of the Yongsheng ferry, the Yongxing ferry traveling the same route was attacked by bandits again. Fortunately, the ship's guards opened fire and defended, and after a fierce battle, they managed to escape. The authorities, seeing the rampant piracy in the Xijiang River and the reluctance of travelers to proceed, decided to send large army and navy forces to suppress them. The Navy Command has dispatched warships such as Jianggong, Jiangda, Jinma, Hushan, Feipeng, and Cunji to Xijiang on designated dates. Commander Liang of the Jiangda warship has been appointed as the commander to cooperate with the army in the suppression efforts. The army has dispatched a security team and a marine corps battalion from the Humen Fortress from the provincial government. At the same time, telegrams have been sent to the four counties of Nanhai, Panyu, Zhongshan, and Shunde, requesting them to send county guerrilla teams to assist in everything upon the arrival of the large army and navy forces. On the 18th, troops advanced to Dongchong, Panyu, to suppress the bandits. More than a thousand bandits in that area resisted stubbornly, holding out for several hours. Many bandits were killed.</p>
<p>Rescued Dozens of Hostages. After the government troops occupied Dongchong, the bandits retreated to the Lanhe area, where they are still being pursued and suppressed. In the Dongjiang area, originally a region frequented by communists, the banditry in Hailufeng has been slightly suppressed recently. The remnants have gathered in the Han River basin of Fengshun and Raoping, as well as the border areas between Fujian and Guangdong. According to Xiang Hanping, the commander of the 62nd Division stationed in Dongjiang, who returned to the province yesterday, the communist bandits in Dongjiang have been severely suppressed several times, and places like Fengshun have been largely pacified. The communist headquarters at Jiulongzhang has also been destroyed. Many members of the Communist District Executive Committee have been arrested and executed. Former coerced followers have been reported separately. Zhang Meixin's brigade of the 62nd Division is currently stationed in the ten counties of Chao'an, and Zhang Da's brigade is stationed in the ten counties of Meixian. The supplementary regiment under Luo Xiuli is stationed in Hailufeng, and is actively engaged in bandit suppression. It is estimated that the pacification work can be completed in three months. Recently, the communist bandits originally planned to join forces with the Communist Party members in Guangxi to cause more trouble in Dongjiang. Fortunately, the authorities took strict precautions and intercepted several key figures midway, leading to stability. Earlier, Yu Zuoyu (Yu Zuobai's younger brother), commander of the 8th Red Army of the Guangxi Communist Party, and three accomplices, after failing in Longzhou, received orders from superiors to travel from Longzhou to Hong Kong via Annam. They intended to take the Guangzhou-Kowloon train from Hong Kong to Dongjiang, but the Public Security Bureau detected their whereabouts. As soon as Yu and his group arrived in Hong Kong, detectives were secretly dispatched to monitor them. Yu and his group secretly entered the mainland from Kowloon on the Guangzhou-Kowloon train on the 13th. Detectives from the Public Security Bureau followed them to Shenzhen station, where they immediately sent a signal and arrested Yu and his group of four. They were taken to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Yu and his group readily admitted their identities. Besides Yu Zuoyu, whose name was well known, the other three are Tang</p>

<p>The Liquidation Issue of the Industrial and Commercial Bank's Branch</p>
<p>Creditor Representatives Petition, Still Handled by the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Regarding the liquidation issue of the Guangzhou branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank, the provincial government decided to have it handled by the court. The bank's creditors believe that this would be time-consuming and costly. Therefore, on the 17th, they convened a general meeting of creditors and unanimously passed a resolution to request the provincial government to revoke the previous decision and have the liquidation handled by the Chamber of Commerce. Yesterday, the 19th, the provincial government held its 105th provincial affairs meeting. The creditor committee members of the bank, including Hu Chishu, Wu Yintang, Guan Zhuohui, and Lai Jiaxiang, brought the petition and went to the provincial government to petition. When the provincial affairs meeting was already in session, the creditor committee members Hu Chishu and others stated their purpose and handed over the petition, requesting the revocation of the decision to have the Guangzhou branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank liquidated by the court, and to have it handled by the Chamber of Commerce instead. They argued that in cases of bankruptcy in the commercial world, where the national government has not promulgated bankruptcy regulations, it is customary to request the Chamber of Commerce to handle the liquidation in eight or nine out of ten cases, and this has been successful. The closure of the Guangzhou branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank was agreed upon by both creditors and debtors, and a request had already been filed with the Chamber of Commerce for liquidation. Therefore, there was no need to have it handled by the court. Moreover, the principle of law is that it does not intervene unless there is a lawsuit. There has been no litigation regarding the debts and credits of the Guangzhou branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank, nor has there been any complaint filed with the court. Therefore, the provincial government's handling of this case should be based on the opinion of the creditors and should not be handed over to the court, causing delays and losses to the creditors. Subsequently, Chairman Chen asked Dean Luo Wenzhuang to express his opinion. Luo argued that this case should be handled by the court, stating that if the bankrupt party does not conceal assets, and there are no disputes over assets, and no objections arise from the creditors, then the Chamber of Commerce can handle the liquidation. However, if the above circumstances occur during the liquidation period, the Chamber of Commerce has no authority to handle them, and therefore cannot conduct a thorough liquidation. Moreover, the bankruptcy law stipulates that if the resolution of the creditors' meeting is contrary to the interests of the bankruptcy creditors, the execution of the resolution may be prohibited upon the creditor's request. Therefore, even if the debts and credits have not been filed with the court, the court can still change the resolution. Then Chairman Chen said that the bankruptcy law has not been formally promulgated. Dean Luo replied that although it has not been formally promulgated, there is a draft that can be used as a basis. He also said that the creditors' attitude towards this case often uses the collapse of the China Merchants Bank as an excuse, saying that the court's handling of cases is time-consuming, but they do not know that the China Merchants Bank incident had nothing to do with the court. Because when the bank collapsed, the Yunnan army was stationed in Guangdong, and depositors used their influence to withdraw funds, leaving only some real estate. Later, due to other reasons, the matter was delayed. At that time, Mayor Lin (referring to Lin Yunkai) was the head of the court, and he should remember what happened. Now, the case of liquidating the Guangzhou branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank is not that the court wants to take over the case, but to lead the people to respect the law and protect the legal interests of the creditors. Now the provincial government has set a limit of three months, and he can take responsibility for it, or it may not take three months to complete the liquidation. If the creditors are concerned about excessive costs, there is absolutely no problem, because the court's staff are all salaried and the creditors do not have to bear any costs. Then Chairman Chen said that the creditors requested that the Chamber of Commerce handle the liquidation, while Dean Luo argued that it should be handled by the court. Therefore, he turned to ask Committee members Jin and Deng. Jin Zengcheng and Deng Yanhua both expressed that it was more appropriate for the court to handle it. Then Chairman Chen said that the creditors' request to have the Chamber of Commerce handle the case was simply a distrust of the government. However, he was willing to take full responsibility for this matter and ensure that the creditors were satisfied, and that the China Merchants Bank fiasco would not be repeated. He then ordered the creditor representatives to go back first and wait for instructions. Hu Chishu and others repeatedly requested that the Chamber of Commerce handle the liquidation before leaving.

<h3 id="e69">New Investigation into Japanese Management of Yanbian <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: The Japanese have long coveted the land of my Yanbian region. Their aggression in the four counties of Yanji, Hunchun, Wangqing, and Helong is mainly carried out through three instruments: police, education, and economy. The current situation is investigated as follows: (1) Police: The Japanese, taking advantage of the privilege of extraterritoriality, arbitrarily summon, interrogate, and arrest Koreans and垦民in the four counties. Although the Sino-Japanese Tumen River Treaty of the past stipulated that each consulate was only allowed one police officer to handle cases, with their inching-forward policy and the method of using police to replace troops in the Hunchun Incident, the number has increased to more than 800 today, distributed in 18 police stations. Japanese police stations are established wherever transportation is convenient and the population is dense. There are 18 places including Longjing Village, Juzi Street, Toudaogou, Wangqing, Hunchun, Liangshui Quanzi, Heidongzi, Gaya River, Yilan, Goujie, Mandong, Nanyangping, Helong, Budong, Erdaogou, Tongfosi, Tianbaoshan, and Badaogou. In addition to setting up Japanese police, Korean Residents Associations are also established in each place to supplement the insufficient strength of the Japanese police. The Police Headquarters is located in Longjing Village, and the other 17 branch offices are directly managed and commanded by the headquarters.</p>
<p>(2) Education: In terms of the number of schools, Japanese education in Yanbian is not as numerous as those established by the Chinese. However, in terms of funding, the funding for Chinese education in the four counties is less than two-fifths of theirs. The following is a description of Japanese education: (1) Gando Central School, located in Longjing Village, has more than 800 students. It is run by the Korean Governor-General and specializes in teaching the children of Koreans. (2) Ordinary Schools, located in Juzi Street, Toudaogou, Baicaogou, and Hunchun, each have one school. They are also run by the Korean Governor-General and are specifically established to teach Korean children. (3) Gando Normal Higher Elementary School, located in Longjing Village, is run by the Korean Governor-General, but it is a school designated by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and specializes in enrolling Japanese children. There are currently more than 130 students. (4) Schools run by the Guangming Society: 1. Yongxin Middle School with attached Normal and Elementary Departments; 2. Guangming Higher Girls' School; 3. Guangming Girls' School; 4. Guangming Kindergarten. The above schools are all located in Longjing Village and are run by the Japanese, Hidaka Heiji郎, who raises funds in his private capacity and receives subsidies from the Korean Governor-General. They specialize in educating Korean children and have a total of more than 650 students. In addition, there are also Japanese-subsidized Korean study halls (i.e., private schools for Koreans, subsidized by the Japanese, using Japanese textbooks). There are more than 50 of these in the four counties of Yanbian. Currently, our side is trying to recover education, but the Japanese have decided to oppose it. Therefore, judging from the current situation, I am afraid it will be very difficult to do so.</p>
<p>(3) Economy: Economic aggression is the sole policy of modern imperialism to invade other countries. The Japanese want to buy up all the land in my four counties of Yanbian, so they have established the following economic institutions throughout the four counties: (1) Joseon Bank Longjing Village Branch; (2) Oriental Development Company Gando Branch; (3) Gando Trust Company; (4) Gando Development Company; (5) Gando Financial Department. The above companies are all located in Longjing Village and specialize in handling banking deposit and loan matters. The interest rate is lower than the average, averaging 1.2% per month. Real estate and grains must be used as collateral. Currently, 3/5ths of the Koreans and Chinese people in the four counties, tempted by the low interest rates, have had their collaterals confiscated. In addition, there is also a Financial Department, nominally an economic institution to help Korean farmers, in each of Jiaozijie, Toudaogou, and Hunchun, specifically to absorb Korean land. According to the investigation, 4/5ths of the Korean land has been absorbed by the Financial Department. This year, the Japanese, in order to make a sharp advance, have further reduced the interest rate, so the general Chinese and Korean people are suffering from economic pressure and have no choice but to disregard the future and willingly suffer the consequences. I hope that our officials and people will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3 id="e70">News Trend in Harbin <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Xue Dake runs the Donghua News to Insult Colleagues. Harbin Correspondence: After Zhang Jingxian came to the Changchun Special Zone, he adopted a policy of suppressing public opinion on the suggestion of Guan Hongyi, the president of the Harbin Public News. Those that have been registered have their freedom of speech restricted, and those who apply for registration are generally not approved. As a result, the special zone's news industry has been extremely dull for the past two years. The authorities believe that opening one less newspaper can save them one less trouble. Guan Hongyi, who made the suggestion to the government, has his own ulterior motives. Because Guan runs a Chinese-Russian Public News, which has made considerable profits over the years, he believes that if this continues, there will be fewer competitors and the profits can continue unabated. This suggestion happened to be deeply in line with the authorities' wishes and became an ironclad case, an unbreakable precedent in the special zone. Last autumn, Xue Dake (Zi Qi), who previously founded the Yellow News in Beiping, came to Harbin to run a Donghua Daily. Because it was not allowed to be registered in the special zone, he first obtained a permit in the Jilin jurisdiction outside Daowai and issued it for nearly a year. Recently, relying on his clever maneuvering, he actually obtained a permit from the special zone and was allowed to register, and the Russian version was also approved for registration at the same time. Xue then moved his newspaper to Daoli. Since its publication, the Chinese version has not developed much, but the Russian version's sales have been increasing rapidly. Guan Hongyi, who runs the Russian Public News, is quite jealous. He has successively destroyed Xue's copyright in the special zone and Liaoning, but to no avail. At this time, the Lubu News and the Aurora News, which are run by the Russian White Party in Harbin, were also affected by the Donghua Daily's sales, so they secretly formed a joint venture with the Russian Public News and vigorously attacked the Russian Donghua Daily. They also bribed the Chinese tabloid Noon News to attack the Chinese Donghua News in the name of the Newspaper Industry Association and revealed Xue's history as one of the Thirteen Taibao of the Hongxian Imperial Restoration. Although the Harbin Newspaper Industry Association exists in name, several newspapers such as the International Cooperative News have not joined the association. Therefore, when this matter first arose, the newspapers that had not joined the association did not pay much attention to it. Later, Xue Dake was scolded too harshly, and a month ago, he wrote a communication that resembled an editorial but was not, and published it on the Chinese version, which contained "For example, when a person walks in a dog country, the dog barks at the person, and the person can only scold it away, and must never imitate the dog's voice and bark back." In addition, the language also invaded the International Cooperative News, Chenguang News, and Dongsan Province Business News, discussing the personality of journalists, etc. This aroused public indignation, and the newspapers convened a meeting and unanimously decided to issue a general attack order against the Donghua News. At least each newspaper would attack the Donghua News for a week. Xue Dake initially resisted, then became silent, and finally asked someone to mediate with the newspapers. The newspapers put forward two conditions: first, the Donghua Daily must publish an apology to the newspapers; second, it must suspend publication for a week. Xue agreed to the first condition, but refused the second condition because it would affect the newspaper's business. The mediation lasted for two weeks, but ultimately to no avail. The newspapers then began to attack again. Xue then mobilized Zhang Jinghui to instruct Bao Wenbo, the chief of the Special Police Department, to invite the chief writers of the newspapers and order them to cease fire. Bao notified the newspapers on the 18th of this month, and his tone contained an order. The newspapers believed that this attack on the Donghua News was merely a debate about the personality of journalists, and did not violate local laws, so the authorities should not forcibly interfere. Therefore, no one went that day. The trend is still unresolved. (August 20th)</p>

<p>The Silkworm Seed Case Has Been Resolved: The Silkworm Industry Enforcement Office of the Agricultural and Mining Department stationed in Wuxi recently seized a large batch of autumn silkworm seeds produced by various seed production sites that had not been approved for registration, such as the Huicheng Silkworm Breeding and Seed Production Site. They were sent to the Xiyu Cold Storage in Guangqin District for storage. The matter was reported to the Agricultural and Mining Department for instructions. The evening before last, hundreds of villagers, claiming to be buyers, flocked to the Enforcement Office to request the return of the seeds, causing a great disturbance.

<p>Bandits Attack and Break Through Yugou Town: It is reported that several hundred bandits from Siyang County passed through Zhuangwei in the county and ate dinner at Sankeshu Market in Huaiyin. At night, they went straight to Yugou Town, which is twelve li from Sankeshu, and attacked from the northwest, south, and three sides. At that time, more than ten county police officers in the town, together with the merchants, came out to fight the enemy from all sides. The two sides held each other until about 4:00 a.m. today (the 22nd). Finally, due to the disparity in numbers, the police team, led by service member Zhang Hongxing, withdrew to Dingji. Dozens of merchants and civilians defending the town also carried their guns and fled from the east gate and the small north gate of Yugou. The bandits then waded into the water from the south moat and climbed in. They then entered through the west and north gates and burned and looted at will. The merchants and civilians in the town also supported the old and carried the young, fleeing in groups to Jiangjiawa and Dingjiaji in the east of the town. Commander Huang of the 266th Regiment, upon hearing the news, sent a company of soldiers and two cannons.

<p>Team Member Tragically Killed by Bandits: Lin Yutang, a team member of the joint military and police investigation office in this city, was ordered on the 23rd to lead troops to the vicinity of Hongtang in Cixi to round up bandits. Because it was midnight, the team member and the soldiers dispersed sentries at the train station there. After some time, a bandit slowly approached. Lin shouted, "Who is there?" The bandit acted suspicious and fled. At that time, Lin was afraid that he was a villager, so he did not shoot, but closely pursued the bandit. Seeing that he was being chased very closely, the thief fired two shots from a pistol. Lin then realized that he was indeed a bandit. Because it was dark, he could not aim, so he used a flashlight to illuminate the bandit. Unexpectedly, the bandit was very alert and, taking advantage of the flashlight, shot at the light, hitting the team member in the abdomen. He was wounded and fell to the ground. The soldiers behind him, seeing that he was injured, carried him to the train station and temporarily settled him there. At the same time, they divided up and chased the bandits. As a result, two bandits were captured and sent to the investigation office for interrogation. Team member Lin died soon after due to his serious injuries.

Liu Shixin, the secretary-general of the provincial government, received them and agreed to send people to conduct an on-site inspection within three days and plan to build a private slaughterhouse to regulate the market. At the same time, the deadline was extended for two months, and business will continue as usual. The representatives were satisfied and returned.</p>

<p>Guerrilla Commander Takes Office and Pacifies the People: Yao Zhidao, the guerrilla commander of Xuzhou, Huaihai, immediately set up a temporary office in Xuzhou after being appointed by General Commander Chiang Kai-shek and issued a proclamation as follows: Proclamation Regarding the Case: It has been received that Commander Chiang of the Army, Navy, and Air Force has issued an appointment certificate from the Liuhe Camp, stating that Yao Zhidao is hereby appointed as the Guerrilla Commander of Xuzhou, Huaihai for the Suppression of Rebels. This certificate, etc. Following this, a temporary office was set up in Xuzhou on the 7th of this month, and the official seals and stamps were put into use. The report has been submitted and distributed. At a time when the military is advancing, it is difficult to guarantee that bandits will not collude with the Communists to cause disturbances in the rear. I, the Commander, have pledged myself to the Party and the country, and Jiangsu Province is also my hometown. Eliminating reactionaries, protecting the territory, and pacifying the people are my responsibilities and cannot be neglected. In addition to sending teams to station in important areas of jurisdiction to strictly prevent disturbances, I will inspect the troops in each district after the deployment is complete, so as to ensure strict discipline, eliminate bandits, consolidate the rear, and ensure the safety of the people. If there are unemployed vagrants, local bullies, or hoodlums who falsely use the name of this headquarters to create rumors or cause trouble, they will be investigated and dealt with once they are reported.</p>

<p>Annual Meeting of the Chinese Agricultural Society Opens in Qingdao; Qingdao Correspondence: The Chinese Agricultural Society held the opening ceremony of its 13th annual meeting at 8:00 AM on the 23rd of this month at the Qingdao National University campus. The Qingdao Municipal Agriculture and Forestry Bureau had made preparations to receive everyone in advance. On that day, more than 80 members and guests arrived. Committee Chairman Xu Xuan presided over the meeting. The proceedings of the meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attendees: The members who registered on the day included Xu Xuan, Chen Zongyi, Zeng Jikuan, Bao Bodu, Shao Weikun, Guan Qianfu, Yang Bangjie, Wang Hengzhi, Wang Jinwu, Liu Yunchou, Hao Qinming, Rao Maosen, Su Yaofeng, Sun Chongxin, Yin Zheding, Han An, Wang Kai, Wu Naican, Wang Lanxin, Sun Wenqing, Zheng Chongshi, Jiang Youcang, Zhou Yaqing, Su Linjiang, Wu Jiazhen, Zhang Haiqiu, Gu Yuxi, She Yizhuo, Jiang Derui, Wang Chengjun, Zhou Jianhou, Shen Deren, Zhou Zhongqi, Ge Jingying, You Xiaobiao, Jin Sixu, Zhang Kai, Zhang Jingxian, Liu Baocheng, Bai Cai, Cheng Jinghao, Sha Fengdao, Wang Weirou, Xu Shangda, Ling Daoyang, Liu Dinggong, Yao Yanqing, Zheng Puyi, etc., totaling 48 people. Guests included Cai Yuanpei, Dean of the University Council; Xu Xuan, representative of the Ministry of Education; Liu Yunchou, representative of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining; Kikuchi Akio, Tanaka Sadaji, Suzuki Kozo, Mimatsu Naoji, and Noguchi Yakichi, representatives of the Japanese Agricultural Society; Wang Xi, representative of the Municipal Government; Han An, Director of the Education Bureau; Mou Junde, Director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau; Yang Zhensheng, President of Qingdao University; Ding Jingchen, Standing Committee Member of the General Chamber of Commerce; journalists from the Press Association, and several dozen others.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address: After the meeting began as scheduled, Chairman Xu Xuan delivered the opening address, stating briefly: "Today is the 13th annual meeting of this society. This society has been established for fifteen years since its founding in the fifth year of the Republic. It has contributed very little to the country and society, and I feel deeply ashamed. When a person reaches the age of fifteen, it is of utmost importance. If they are well-educated at this time, they will surely achieve great things in the future. Otherwise, they will achieve nothing in their lives. As this society is at this stage, our colleagues should make special efforts to maintain it, so that it can grow from childhood to adulthood, and not disappoint the expectations of the people of the country. Currently, all countries in the world are experiencing unemployment problems, especially England and Japan. Examining the reasons, England has always relied on industry and commerce to build the country, neglecting agriculture early on. Once commerce declines and industrial production suffers from oversupply, unemployment increases, leading to political and social unrest that cannot be maintained. Although Japan pays great attention to agriculture, it ultimately cannot compare with industry and commerce. Therefore, cities expand and rural areas decline. Once affected by changes in the global economy, unemployment problems arise. It can be seen that if countries around the world continue to focus solely on industry and commerce and neglect agriculture in the future, the danger will be even greater than today. China's agriculture is declining, and it is even more difficult for industry and commerce to compete with the great powers. (Omission) As for agriculture, it is China's inherent industry and easier to develop. Therefore, in the current situation, we should promote industry and commerce on one hand and develop agriculture on the other. However, to develop agriculture, it is essential to start with science. Examining countries like Germany, the United States, France, and Japan, each has its own characteristics in agricultural science, but our country does not. For example, the teaching materials used in agricultural schools are mostly translated from foreign countries, and there is very little research on our country's agriculture. This is undeniable. I hope that colleagues in this society will conduct special research on our country's agriculture in various categories in the future, and develop an independent agricultural science for China. Then the development and improvement of agriculture can be anticipated." After the Chairman finished speaking, Cai Yuanpei, Liu Yunchou, Wang Xi, Kikuchi Hisao, Yang Zhensheng, Mou Junde, Ling Daoyang, Zeng Jikuan, and others gave speeches in succession. Then, they took a photo and adjourned the meeting.</p>

<p>The joint office for preparing compulsory education in various counties of Jiangsu Province has designated Yonggu Township, Zhenjiang, as a universal education experimental zone, named Zhongleng New Village. Chu Xiongbo has been hired as a design committee member to actively carry out the New Village project. A village meeting was held at Dingmao Elementary School the other day, attended by Township Head Cui Guangfu, neighborhood chiefs, and others. The office staff members Chu Xiongbo and Xie Zeren, Dingmao Elementary School Principal Zhang Xixian, and more than 60 guests and villagers were present. Cui Guangfu chaired the meeting, and Xie Zeren served as the recorder. The chairman reported that the Yijiao office would guide the village's transformation, develop the village's economy, improve the village's organization, and promote the village's culture to make the village a model village, on the one hand, to seek happiness for the villagers, and on the other hand, to provide a reference for counties throughout the province. He asked everyone to work hard together to promote progress. Subsequently, Chu Xiongbo reported that in carrying out the village's project, the focus must first be on the economy, as the saying goes, "educate after becoming rich." There are several aspects to the project: (1) Establishing a farm to test and improve agricultural products; (2) Raising fish; (3) Organizing an irrigation cooperative; (4) New Village autonomy. In terms of cultural projects, such as utilizing natural scenery to develop parks and implementing education for young children and adults, these should also be carried out step by step, with the goal of achieving significant progress within three years. Subsequently, the regulations of the Zhongleng New Village Preparatory Committee were approved, and Cui Guangfu, Zhao Debao, Lu Yueting, Tian Dengxi, Yin Derong, Zhang Xixian, and Xie Zeren were elected as executive committee members on the spot. Then, the executive committee held a meeting, appointed members to draft the executive committee's charter, decided on a plan to repair the Dizang Nunnery as an office, and actively prepared for all matters to proceed.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Wuhan University Builds Water and Electricity Plant <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Since the National Wuhan University selected the lakeside of East Lake in Wuchang to build a new campus, bids have been submitted one after another for the entire project, such as the liberal arts college, science and engineering college, male and female dormitories, auditorium, and faculty residences, and construction has already started. The main buildings are located on the top and hillside of Luojia Mountain, with a majestic appearance. When completed in the future, it will be very spectacular. The faculty residences are built in the style of new villages, with more than 30 buildings in total. Now that various projects have reached a considerable degree, the university has decided that the most important water and electricity supply should be set up as soon as possible. It has decided to build a large-scale water and electricity plant. The drawings and budget have been finalized by the personnel of the university's engineering college. Letters have been sent to well-known foreign merchants of electrical materials in Shanghai and Hankou, asking manufacturers in various countries for prices. Several black oil engines are needed, as well as several generators and water pumps. The generators can supply power to the two colleges of science and engineering, and also for 3,000 to 4,000 electric lights within the campus area. The water pumps can supply drinking water for 3,000 people. Including the installation of water pipes and electric wires, the total construction cost of water and electricity is estimated to be more than 100,000 yuan. The price estimates from various foreign firms have been arriving at the university one after another, and the best will be selected for purchase soon, with the aim of completing the installation within six months.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Municipal Education Bureau Formulates Moral Education Standards <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Municipal School Academic Performance Assessment Measures to be Announced Soon</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau believes that there are numerous schools in the city, and there is no unified method for moral education management. While there are many who do well, there are also not a few who are lax. The local environment is complex, and the will of young people is not yet determined. If there are no moral education standards, then each school will govern itself or implement them poorly, which is not a blessing for the young people of society. Director Chen has previously appointed a committee to formulate moral education standards for schools at all levels. It is reported that in compiling the moral education standards, the committee, in addition to following the educational purpose, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, and educational principles, also pays attention to (1) strictness, (2) suitability for local conditions, (3) concreteness and practicability, and (4) consistency.</p>
<p>In addition, the bureau believes that the methods for assessing the academic performance of students in municipal schools are not uniform. Often, the scores assigned to the same course differ greatly depending on the leniency or strictness of the marker, sometimes differing by one or two semesters. School A believes that a student can graduate, while School B may think that the student cannot pass. Students are directly affected by this, and it is also inconvenient to assess their performance. Therefore, the research section has specially formulated various academic performance assessment methods. All aspects of course marking, promotion, retention, graduation, and failing are subject to review methods, with the aim of being consistent with educational principles and easy to calculate. The entire process is nearing completion and will be announced soon.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Municipal Education Bureau Orders Submission of Timetables <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to municipal schools and registered private schools stating: "It has been found that schools are required to submit two copies of the current timetable for each grade at the beginning of each semester for verification. It is now found that elementary schools in this city have already started the new semester. In accordance with academic qualifications, the current timetable for each grade in the current semester should be copied and submitted in duplicate by September 3rd for review. This bureau hereby orders all municipal and registered private elementary schools to comply with this order."</p>
<h3 id="e95">The Latest Projects of the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Recent progress in the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute's projects: (1) Guidance for further education: An average of about 15 people per day, mostly young people from other provinces, who are unfamiliar with the content of Shanghai schools, request detailed guidance. (2) Employment guidance: Mostly for graduates of various schools, those who are successful generally have genuine skills, specialized knowledge, and are willing to start small. (3) Service guidance: The institute publicly investigates service performance, and provides encouragement and advice, using both written and spoken methods. (4) Health guidance: Focuses on avoiding occupational diseases and paying attention to self-cultivation and exercise. Recently, with Dr. Ge Chenghui going to the United States for investigation, Dr. Zeng Liqun has been invited to take over. (5) Job placement: This work is the most complex. An average of 50 to 60 letters and telegrams are received daily, and the number of interviews is more than 30 people. In July and August, about 1,000 people registered, but only about one-tenth were successful. Yesterday, a telegram was received from the Hankou Municipal Government Education Bureau, entrusting the recommendation of specialized talent in rattan work, dyeing and weaving, and handicrafts, each with a monthly salary of 60 yuan. The Jilin Provincial Vocational School sent a telegram requesting the introduction of two professors of clerical studies, who must be proficient in Chinese typing, Chinese shorthand, and official document formats, archival processing, service ethics, and library science, with a monthly salary of 120 yuan. In addition, an agency entrusted the recruitment of two clerks, who should be proficient in documentation, have beautiful calligraphy, a clear mind, and a strong body, with a monthly salary of 30 to 40 yuan. Applicants can first submit the drafts and small regular script samples of the documents they intend to write to the institute for consultation as soon as possible. A school in this city is looking for a female teacher to teach 24 hours per week, with a monthly salary of about 20 yuan, and a female teacher for singing, dancing, and handicrafts, with a monthly salary of 10 yuan. (5) Seeking art friends: Entrusted by a certain society, the institute is seeking two art friends who must be clear in writing and reasoning, have beautiful calligraphy, be meticulous, and be ambitious to pursue further studies. The society will teach them various knowledge and research opportunities at any time, and may provide subsidies. Young men and women who are ambitious to serve and seek to improve themselves, and who wish to become art friends, can go to No. 30 Hualong Road at any time to consult with the institute in person.</p>

The attendees included Qian Xinzhi, Fang Jiaobo, Wang Zhengting (representing Jin Wensi), Yu Youren, Jin Wensi, Jiang Ping, and Zhang Tinghao. Director Shao Lizi also sent a telegram expressing his opinion. At that time, Director Qian Xinzhi presided over the meeting. First, Secretary-General Jin Tongyin, entrusted by President Li, reported the facts of the case. Then, Director Zhang Tinghao reported the mediation situation, and then the method of resolution was discussed. All directors advocated inviting the original principal, Chen Wangdao, to cancel his leave and return to the school (acting principal Wang Shihao has already resigned). They also discussed the issues of faculty and staff and rectifying the school spirit this semester. Finally, it was resolved: (1) President Li should return to the school to take charge; (2) All follow-up matters related to the Practical Middle School should be handled properly by Director Chen Wangdao in consultation with President Li. After the meeting adjourned, President Li sent a letter to Director Chen Wangdao, asking him to return to the school to take charge immediately. The two-month dispute was thus concluded.</p>

<p>The College of Commerce of National Central University is scheduled to start classes on September 8th this year. Because the old campus at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Route Doumer is about to be renovated, and the new campus built by the university on Jiangwan Road has not yet been completed, it is temporarily difficult to move in. Moreover, because there are many new and old students this semester, the original site is not sufficient. Therefore, it has been decided to move to No. 921 to 923 Avenue Joffre, Rue des Soeurs, which has three large foreign-style houses with fresh air, which is very suitable for school use. The transportation is also convenient. The interior is currently being decorated and is expected to be completed before the start of school. The girls' dormitory is still located on campus, while the boys' dormitory is still located in Taoyuan Village, Rue Lafayette.</p>

<p>Tonight at 8 PM, battle with Tianma...still at the Jiande Association</p>
<p>Last night was the battle between the Hong Kong Table Tennis Team and the Qibu Table Tennis Team. The venue was still the gymnasium of the Jiande Association. At half past eight, the referee, Mr. Zhou Weifen, sounded the silver horn. Peng Chang started, and the results were as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong Team  Qibu Team   Score   Winner</p>
<p>Chen Yingting  Li Minggong  3:1  Hong Kong</p>
<p>Deng Yaopeng  Chen Zhaowen  2:3  Qibu</p>
<p>Huang Pingwu  Zhu Yongkang  3:2  Hong Kong</p>
<p>Huo Xianchao  Qiu Naijun  3:1  Hong Kong</p>
<p>Mo Qinghuan  Tian Changqing  3:2  Hong Kong</p>
<p>Zeng Yingfu  Zhu Shanliang  3:2  Hong Kong</p>
<p>Chen Yingting  Chen Dingyuan  3:1  Hong Kong</p>
<p>Looking at their skills, Hong Kong mostly used defensive play, with older players who blocked the ball low and quickly, making it difficult for the opponent to use a smash. Qibu was established not long ago, and all the players are mostly 13 or 14 years old. They often use smashes, which are not yet refined. However, with these results, it is not easy.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Fights Tianma Tonight</p>
<p>The Tianma Table Tennis Team is one of the strongest teams in Shanghai, organized by people from the Race Club. Starting players such as Lu Shentong, Zhou Weixin, and Weng Zhixiang all attended and participated. Because the Hong Kong team was tired from the journey, they did not have a full recovery, which led to their defeat at the Jiande Association the night before. The reporter observed that in last night's battle with Qibu, they were energetic and skilled, and they won by a score of six to one. Tonight, they will meet Tianma. They are evenly matched, and it is difficult to predict who will win.</p>

<p>Party, Government, and Military Resolution</p>
<p>Preparing for a Mass Rally to Celebrate the Suppression of Communists and Traitors</p>
<p>Scheduled for the Morning of the 29th at the Public Sports Ground</p>
<p>Various organizations and groups in this city, indignant at the Communist Party's poisoning of Hunan and Hubei, and the massacre of innocent civilians, believe it is necessary to thoroughly eradicate them. At the same time, because the rebel army has collapsed and victories are being achieved in the suppression of rebels, the morale of the entire city is exceptionally high. Therefore, it was decided to hold a mass rally to show the determination to suppress the Communists and celebrate the victory over the rebels. Preparations for this event have already begun. Yesterday, a conference was held among representatives from the Party, government, and military to decide on appropriate measures. Attendees included representatives from Party, government, and military organizations such as Yang Qingyuan, Wu Bokang, Chen Junyi, Huang Guangdou, Qi Xuan, Guo Yongxi, and Li Xilong. After formal introductions, Wu Bokang, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Party Committee, was elected chairman.

<h3 id="e106">Jinliyuan Wharf Case <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Liu Yunfang and Gan Gelin Meet Three Times</p>
<p>Resolving Key Issues Before Arbitration Negotiations</p>
<p>The dispute between the China Merchants Bureau's Jinliyuan Wharf and the French Jesuit "Sandetang" (Three Virtues Hall) has been handled through diplomatic channels. Director Liu Yunfang of the Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai and French Consul General Gan Gelin have negotiated twice to change the legal procedures to arbitration. The China Merchants Bureau and Sandetang have each appointed arbitrators and are preparing to make contact. However, during the second negotiation, the French Consul expressed to Director Liu the hope that the China Merchants Bureau would first provide a bank guarantee for timely payment of rent, to facilitate the arbitration process, before the arbitrators from both sides formally engage. Director Liu also considered this request reasonable and relayed it to Cai Ziping, General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, and Secretary-General Xu Xiuzhi, asking them to arrange the bank guarantee for timely payment of rent as soon as possible, so that the arbitrators from both sides could meet soon. The China Merchants Bureau obtained the consent of Sun Hengfu of the Siming Bank to provide the guarantee. Yesterday, the China Merchants Bureau formally negotiated with the Siming Bank and decided to use the Bureau's property rental income in Jiujiang as collateral for the Siming Bank to guarantee the rent payment. Cai, the General Manager, prepared an official letter to the French Consul. To ensure prudence and hoping that the French Consul would mediate, Liu was requested to meet with the French Consul yesterday afternoon and explain the contents of Cai's official letter, asking him to forward it. Liu met with the French Consul and briefly explained the content of the Chinese official letter. The French Consul expressed his satisfaction and said he would be responsible for urging Sandetang to order its arbitrators to start negotiations with the China Merchants Bureau's arbitrators as soon as possible. The French Consul also said that while the will of the priests of Sandetang could not fully represent a response, he believed the outcome would not deviate from the spirit of maintaining the old agreement. Liu further stated to the French Consul that since the bank guarantee for timely payment of rent had been resolved, there was no reason or need to increase the annual rent. The French Consul replied that this point was easy to resolve, and even if there was an increase, the amount would be minimal and not significantly different from the original rent. The content of General Manager Cai's official letter to the French Consul is as follows: "Regarding the dispute between our Bureau and Sandetang regarding the lease, we thank you for your mediation and renewal. Our Bureau has appointed arbitrators, and their names and addresses have been sent to you. Regarding the issue of a bank guarantee for the annual rent, we have agreed with the Shanghai Siming Bank to provide a guarantee that the annual rent will be paid in full on time. We hereby notify you, the Consul General, and ask you to verify and inform Sandetang to begin arbitration immediately." Respectfully, to French Consul General Gan, China Merchants Bureau, General Manager Cai Pei, August 26th, Republic of China, 19th year.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Chen Xizeng Returns to Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Firmly Declines the Position of General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau</p>
<p>And Hands Over the Directorship of the Telegraph Bureau</p>
<p>Chen Xizeng, Director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, after being appointed by the National Government as General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, considered the China Merchants Bureau's future in the shipping industry to be of great importance and felt that his talent and ability were insufficient, and that he was unprepared. If he were to take office rashly without plans for reorganization, he would feel ashamed of the central government's initial intention. Therefore, after receiving the order, he immediately resigned via telegram and went to the central government to express his difficulties. Subsequently, the National Government's Civil Service Office urged him to take office via telegram, and various central figures earnestly tried to persuade him to stay. However, Chen did not change his intention to resign. It is now reported that Chen went to Nanjing again the day before yesterday to personally submit his resignation to President Tan of the National Government. President Tan still indicated that he was unable to approve it. Chen repeatedly stated that if he were to take office, it would not benefit the future of the China Merchants Bureau, and that he was unwilling to take on the position, requesting that he be allowed to resign. Chen returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. A reporter from the "New Voice" visited him yesterday. According to Chen, he is firm in his resignation as General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau. As for the position of Director of the Telegraph Bureau, the Ministry of Communications has appointed Song Shuqiao to take over. He immediately went to the bureau and notified all important staff members to prepare for the handover. Once the handover is completed, Chen plans to go to the front lines to serve.</p>

<p>Discussions on Holding a National Products Exhibition in Singapore</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, upon receiving an order from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to hold a national products exhibition in Singapore, has issued separate letters to various national products organizations in the city, as well as the silk and satin industry trade unions, stating, "Singapore is the most commercially prosperous area in the Nanyang Islands, with a large number of overseas Chinese residing there. Holding an exhibition in that port to promote national products is an essential plan. In order to develop our country's foreign trade in silk fabrics, the Ministry has issued orders to various overseas Chinese merchants, asking them to assess the timing and collect domestic silk fabrics within the meeting hall to hold an exhibition. The Singapore Chamber of Commerce has responded, reiterating the decision of Shanghai national products manufacturers to send personnel to prepare for the exhibition, requesting that the Shanghai silk industry compile a register of factory names and addresses, and submit samples of silk products and price lists for the exhibition, or send personnel to promote sales." Previously, the Shanghai Business Adjustment Association reported that Shanghai national products manufacturers had decided to go to Singapore to prepare for the exhibition, and letters had been sent to the China National Products Maintenance Association and other organizations to comply. It is now necessary for the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to verify whether the associations have complied. If preparations are underway in accordance with the previous decision, it is necessary to inform silk weaving manufacturers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to comply. In addition to instructing the Singapore Chamber of Commerce to convene local overseas Chinese merchants to discuss exhibition methods and report for review, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is hereby instructed to comply, directly contact the Singapore Chamber of Commerce for handling.</p>

<p>Egyptian merchant Burstien suggested organizing a China-Egypt commodity exhibition and telegraphed the merchant company in Shanghai to solicit samples and prices of special Chinese tobacco leaves. It is requested to collect samples and prices from tobacco leaf exporters and other commodities that can be sold in Egypt, and send them to him to organize a Chinese commodity exhibition. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has been informed to order the Shanghai Bureau of Industry and Commerce Survey to send samples of special tobacco leaves from tobacco leaf exporters, along with accurate price descriptions and cargo delivery procedures, directly to the merchant for contact. If there are other commodities that can be sold in Egypt, it is also necessary to conduct a detailed investigation to develop foreign trade. The Bureau is currently working on investigating various commodities and compiling them for sending.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Obstacles to Hunan Rice Exports <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Additional Taxes Arouse Repercussions</p>
<p>The Hunan provincial authorities previously announced that the ban on Hunan rice exports would be lifted on the 22nd of this month. Therefore, Shanghai rice merchants prepared to go to Hunan for purchases, but unexpectedly encountered obstacles. The reasons for this are described in detail below.</p>
<p>Additional Taxes Suspended: The Hunan government had previously announced the regulations for rice transport passport fees, notifying the rice industry to take note. However, after the ban lifting order was announced on the 22nd, the provincial authorities announced that an additional special tax would be levied on exported rice to supplement government expenses. Rice merchants in Changsha unanimously opposed this. According to yesterday's telegram, the rice merchants have agreed to stop applying. Those who have already purchased rice but have not yet shipped it will also stop loading if the provincial authorities order them to pay the rice tax. The rice merchants are resisting the rice tax with a passive attitude. If it is not canceled, they will refrain from doing business, rendering the ban lifting order ineffective.</p>
<p>No Rice Loaded for Shanghai: After the order to lift the ban on rice exports in Hunan was announced, various shipping companies competed to send ships to Hunan in an effort to transport this rice to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the additional tax caused an unforeseen event. Yesterday, various shipping companies in this city received telegrams from Hunan stating that ships that had arrived in Changsha had no rice to load because the rice merchants refused to pay the tax. This matter has not been resolved. The shipping lines in Hunan are diverting to transporting soybeans to Shanghai because there is a large stockpile of soybeans in Changsha, while the export of rice is temporarily hopeless.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Setbacks in the Resumption of Navigation on the Upper Yangtze <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>After the resumption of navigation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the Shanghai-Hunan shipping companies unexpectedly encountered setbacks yesterday due to the postponement of cargo transportation. What we have heard is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>First Batch of Goods to Hunan Postponed: Hunan Changsha shipping companies reported loading a large batch of foreign miscellaneous goods, textiles, cotton yarn, sugar, etc., with the first batch shipped directly from Shanghai amounting to 2,000 tons. Because they had to arrive in Hunan by the end of this month, the shipping companies were approved to use the British Taikoo company's "Xiangtan" ship for transportation. It was originally scheduled to depart this morning, and customs clearance procedures were being processed. Suddenly, a urgent telegram arrived from Changsha, instructing to postpone the direct shipment of this large batch of goods. Yesterday, the shipping companies notified Taikoo, and the departure of "Xiangtan" to Changsha was also temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Chinese Ships Also Stop Navigating Upstream: Sanbei company's "Hongheng" and "Hongyuan" ships were originally dedicated to the Changsha route. This time, "Hongheng" arrived in Shanghai and had its rudder repaired. It was scheduled to depart on the 28th and originally planned to go directly to Hunan. Yesterday, they received a telegram from Hankou stating that the water level in the upper reaches of the river had dropped significantly. If the ship were to enter Hunan, cargo may be in danger. For the sake of safe navigation and passengers and cargo, the company changed its route to Hankou. They also notified the shipping companies not to load goods directly to Changsha. At the same time, they also telegraphed the "Hongyuan" ship upstream to switch to the downstream route.</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Stopped Commercial Services First: Nisshin company's "Yuanjiang" ship has suspended its Changsha service and is transporting Japanese residents to Hankou.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Shanghai <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Statement from the Water Company</p>
<p>Reasons for Appropriately Increasing Water Prices</p>
<p>The Shanghai Water Company of the Public Concession issued a statement yesterday, stating that there has been criticism from the outside about the increase in water prices. To avoid misunderstandings, the following statement is made: The company's dividends have been stipulated in a contract with the Public Works Department. The current price increase is not intended to increase dividends. Furthermore, the water price standard has never been as high as 10% or 12%. The current rate for residential water use is 6% of the rent, and after the price increase, it will be only 7.5%. This shows that the impact on individual rent is minimal. This water price has no relation to the amount of water used and cannot be said to restrict people's water use or deprive them of their drinking needs. Other water prices are also increased in the same proportion. This price increase was approved by the Sino-foreign board of directors after the Public Works Department sent personnel to inspect the accounts. The company's ability to supply drinking water has always been recognized by citizens. In order to maintain its effectiveness, it is necessary to increase expenses. This increase in expenses is entirely due to the sharp drop in the price of silver.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Revised Handling of Sino-Foreign Lawsuits <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>First Instance Cases of Sino-Foreign Lawsuits</p>
<p>Will Be Tried by the County Starting Next Month</p>
<p>After the abolition of the Commissioners for Foreign Affairs in various provinces, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stipulated the procedures for handling Sino-foreign lawsuits. All Sino-foreign appeal cases accepted by the Commissioner's Office that have not been concluded will be handled by the High Courts or Branch Courts of various provinces in accordance with ordinary litigation procedures. The Judicial Yuan believes that there should be some supplementation regarding the previous method because some appeal cases in accordance with ordinary laws should be accepted by the District Court. After consulting with the Judicial Yuan, two revised methods have been established, which will be promulgated by the Judicial Yuan to the courts of various provinces for compliance and notified by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the ministers of various countries for reference. The revised methods are as follows: (1) All appeal cases of Sino-foreign lawsuits that have been accepted and not concluded before the abolition of the Commissioner's Office shall be handled by the High Court or its Branch Court (After the District Court or its Branch Court renders a judgment on an appeal case of first instance, another appeal may be made to the Supreme Court). Sino-foreign lawsuits after the abolition shall be handled in accordance with the usual procedures. However, if preliminary jurisdiction over Sino-foreign appeal cases was exercised by the High Court or its Branch Court before this order arrived, the High Court or its Branch Court shall continue to handle them. (2) For first instance cases of Sino-foreign lawsuits, starting from September 1, 1919, all counties that do not concurrently administer justice shall be handled by the competent court (District Courts and their Branch Courts, local divisions or county courts that are attached to them, and counties that concurrently administer justice shall continue to be handled by the county magistrate for the time being). However, in civil cases, with the consent of both parties, they may request the court to accept the case in accordance with the regulations of consensual jurisdiction in the Revised Civil Procedure Law.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Chief of Section of Japanese Foreign Ministry Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Related to the Issue of the Japanese Minister to China</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that Mr. Tani Masayuki, Chief of the First Section of the Asian Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who was specially dispatched to Shanghai by the Japanese government, arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the Nagasaki Maru postal ship. Shigemitsu Aoi, the acting Japanese minister in Shanghai, and other important officials and gentry greeted him at the port. After landing, Chief Tani went by car with Shigemitsu to the Japanese Consulate and held a closed-door meeting with Mr. Shigemitsu for two hours before leaving for the Wansui Pavilion for rest. That night, he took a night train to Beijing to meet with Consul Kamimura in Beijing to discuss important matters. When he arrived in Shanghai, Chinese and Japanese reporters boarded the ship for a short conversation, asking about the mission of his visit to China. Chief Tani refused to announce it, saying that it was confidential. However, he stated that matters concerning the Changqiu case, etc., were the responsibility of Chief Sangashima of the Second Section. Therefore, his visit to China was not for this matter. However, according to Japanese sources, Tani Masayuki's visit to Shanghai was indeed with an important mission, which was related to the changing of the Japanese minister to China. The Japanese government had previously planned to transfer Acting Minister Shigemitsu to the position of Director of the Asian Bureau and appoint a new minister to China. Because there had been no prior consultations, misunderstandings arose after the news was released, leading to a deadlock that has not been implemented to this day. Therefore, Chief Tani was specially sent to Shanghai to meet with Acting Minister Shigemitsu to explain everything and exchange opinions. Mr. Tani is now scheduled to take the liaison ship back to his country tomorrow (28th) to report on his mission. It is expected that there will be new news about the practical solution to the issue of the Japanese minister to China.</p>

<p>Investigating Dismissal Customs in Various Industries</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to various trade associations to investigate the dismissal dates of old customs in various industries in the city and to formulate measures for implementing the Gregorian calendar. The letter stated, "On the 25th of this month, the Social Affairs Bureau ordered an investigation into the admission and dismissal of employees in stores, which are temporarily handled in accordance with the old customs of various industries and changed to the Gregorian calendar. This Bureau has already announced it in Announcement No. 146. The dismissal dates of old customs in various industries in this city are inconsistent, some based on the peak and off-seasons of business, and some based on accounting dates. Each has its own reasons and can be followed as a custom. After changing to the Gregorian calendar, whether there will be any obstacles should be investigated in detail for review and approval. You are hereby ordered to comply and promptly and thoroughly investigate the dismissal dates of old customs in various industries in this city and formulate measures for implementing the Gregorian calendar and report for verification." Because the dismissal dates of employees in various industries are different, it is necessary to investigate and then summarize and consider measures. A letter is sent in advance for notification. Please investigate and reply in detail within five days of receiving the letter, stating the dismissal date stipulated in the customs of your industry, for the purpose of compiling and considering measures. This is very important.</p>

<p>Hope for Resolution of Rice Subsidy Issue</p>
<p>Employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railroads with salaries above 50 yuan were facing difficulty in maintaining their livelihoods due to the soaring rice prices. Representatives were elected by the workers of the Wusong Machine Factory to petition the railroad bureau, requesting rice and housing subsidies. Liu Weizhi, Director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways and concurrently in charge of affairs of the two railroads, met with them and agreed to request the Ministry to act as an agent. The Ministry of Railways approved a rice subsidy of one yuan for those with salaries above 30 yuan. The workers felt that the amount was too small and insufficient, and continued to elect representatives to request again. Director Liu agreed to ask the Ministry again. It was said that the Ministry of Railways believed that the railroad bureau's income was not as good as before, and if further additions were made without end, the railroad was in danger of bankruptcy. Therefore, the request to the Ministry was made repeatedly. The Ministry approved yesterday to grant a rice subsidy of one and a half yuan to those with salaries above 30 yuan, and a subsidy of one yuan to those with salaries above 50 yuan. According to investigations, although this rice subsidy is small, it requires an additional budget of more than 100,000 yuan per year for the railroad bureau.</p>

<p>Proclamation of the Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Headquarters issued a proclamation yesterday, stating, "For the sake of proclamation, transportation on the two railroads is extremely important, and all soldiers traveling must abide by discipline. In recent months, there have often been wounded soldiers without tickets, infringing on seats, which disrupts regulations and not only hinders railroad administration, but also tarnishes the reputation of the military. An order has been issued to the railroad bureau to add a third-class train car specifically for wounded soldiers, and all units, rear hospitals, railroad guard conscripts, and military police are to comply, strictly investigate, and specially issue this earnest proclamation. Hereafter, no matter what kind of soldiers are traveling, if they rely on their strength and act recklessly, and the above-mentioned situation occurs again, once discovered, they will be severely punished without leniency."</p>

<p>Celebrate the Victory, Punish Wang</p>
<p>The Autonomous Association of Students of the Shanghai Special City Party Department Union Secretary Training Institute held its first general meeting yesterday and passed many resolutions. Two telegrams are recorded below: (1) Congratulatory Telegram (Omitted above). Jining was recovered, achieving successive victories. It is reported that we cannot help but rejoice. Our Commander-in-Chief Chiang commanded the army, and no fortress can resist. The generals risked their lives to kill the enemy, and the enemy was terrified. This time, the elite of the rebels was almost completely wiped out by our army. As the autumn wind rises, we know that every tree and bush is full of soldiers. How long will it take to lose our time? We are eagerly awaiting good news, holding the sincerity of one heart and one mind, thinking of capturing the thief and capturing the king. We swear to punish the White Horse and forget the sweat. We look forward to the day when we will be able to celebrate the victory with the Yellow Dragon. We respectfully send a telegram to congratulate you and look forward to your triumphant return. (2) Telegram to Punish Wang (Omitted above). It is learned that there is an organization of an expanded meeting in Beiping, attempting to establish itself as the government and undermining unity. Its illegal actions are unforgivable. The remnants of the warlords Yan and Feng are insignificant. However, Wang Jingwei abandoned his history in the Party, was deceived by the great punishment of the leader, treated enemies like fathers, sacrificed his personality without hesitation, undermined unity without regard, and was insane. He has already attached himself to the warlords and changed his mind and abandoned his principles. What revolution can he talk about? He is desperately clinging to the banner of the Three Principles of the People, publicly calling for reorganization, talking nonsense, and confusing the public. The masses are not stupid and may not be deceived. Recently, he has seen that the central government's army to punish the rebels is winning victory after victory, and it is only a matter of time before they reach Youyan. He is colluding with the Communists and harboring bandits to disrupt the rear, harboring evil intentions, and poisoning the country. In summary, his recent counter-revolutionary actions, even the bamboo of Nanshan, are not enough to record his crimes, and the waves of the East Sea cannot wash away his shame. Alas, he is running in the opposite direction. Chen Xiang's voice claims to cultivate with plows and hoes. He cruelly injures the people to achieve his goals. Yang Zhen's resentment of a bowl of soup is a stain on his life. How can Wang Ni be so willing to face ruin? These words are still in my ears, and loyalty has not been forgotten. The Prime Minister's bones are not yet cold, and why is the central plains still in chaos? If Qingfu is not removed, the difficulties of Lu will not end. Therefore, we cry out loudly, "Down with the shameless and betraying Wang Jingwei who avenges his enemies! Down with the reorganization faction! Long live the Chinese Kuomintang! Long live the Republic of China!" We declare this.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Baoshan County Held a County Administration Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Baoshan County Magistrate Qiu Mingjiu convened a county administration meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the west conference hall of the county government, attended by the heads of various bureaus under his jurisdiction, including Shen Jing, Qian Tianpeng, Wu Jietai, Pu Wengui, Wang Tongchuan, Yin Xiangsun, Xue Ying, Ji Zhonghe, Xu Liangxi, Ling Bin, and Shu Mengyuan. Magistrate Qiu, serving as chairman, reported on the following matters: The government previously used 140 yuan from the variable expenses of the First District Office for the repair of the county government's main hall and leaking roofs inside the building. The project is now completed, totaling 164.24 yuan. As the funds are local, a detailed report of the actual expenditure should be presented for public review and verification. Discussion items included: (1) After the stone bridge outside the South Gate was collapsed by military factory vehicles carrying cannons, this government sent a letter urging its prompt repair. On the 23rd (Saturday), the military factory sent engineer Zhang Deqing to survey the site, planning to use a steel bridge from the Railway Bureau for the reconstruction. The military factory would bear the cost. However, the two bridge abutments need to be widened by about one foot each and reinforced with cement to make the steel bridge surface more robust. The military factory intends to request Baoshan County to bear the cost of rebuilding these bridge abutments. Please decide on the matter. (Decision) The county government should instruct the Construction Bureau to send personnel to directly liaise with engineer Zhang Deqing of the military factory for detailed discussions, and then estimate the cost of rebuilding the two bridge abutments for further review. (2) The city wall near the South Gate has been significantly damaged by various public and private constructions, with many city bricks removed. As the South Gate is the only major gate in Baoshan, this is unsightly. Should the dismantling be prohibited, or to what extent should it be restricted to avoid hindering both public and private construction and local aesthetics? Please decide on the matter. (Decision) The Construction Bureau and the Education Bureau are responsible for preliminary planning and arrangement. The county government should issue a public notice prohibiting further random dismantling. (3) The stone suspension bridge outside the North Gate is showing signs of damage again. Should the passage of heavy vehicles be restricted? (Decision) The Construction and Public Security Bureau should jointly stipulate the weight of vehicles allowed to pass and post a notice to enforce the restriction. (4) Farm Director Li Zhonghe proposed that the issue of rickshaw license fees in Shishan County had been approved by the previous County Magistrate Wu at the county administration meeting, and a collection method was submitted to the authorities for approval. However, it has not been effectively implemented. Please decide on a solution. (Decision) The county government should investigate the case and order the relevant bureau to implement it effectively.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Meeting Record of the Disaster Relief and慰勞 Association <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles Disaster Relief for War-Affected Areas and慰勞 Frontline Soldiers大会 held a joint meeting of all groups at its headquarters yesterday afternoon. Attendees included Xu Fu, Xu Ji, Chen Junyi, Pan Gongzhan, Kui Yanfang, Qin Runqing, Wang Yiting, Zheng Huizhu, Wang Binyan, and others. Wang Yiting chaired the meeting. First, Zheng Chengqing reported on the work status and donation amount of the past week. The results of the subsequent discussions were as follows: (1) Use the existing funds to purchase clothing and禦寒 items, but first collect samples and finalize the plan. (2) Send another letter urging all fundraisers to remit the donations to the bank immediately. (3) Send letters to the four designated donation-receiving banks, requesting them to reply with the names of the donors who have submitted donations.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Letter Requesting the Use of Domestic Paper <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Shouzhi's Reply to the Shanghai All-Circles Relief and慰勞 Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles Fundraising Association for Disaster Relief for War-Affected Areas and慰勞 Frontline Soldiers sent out notices, regulations, and donation booklets to solicit support from all sectors in order to actively carry out disaster relief and慰勞. Zheng Shouzhi, in addition to replying with a letter agreeing to do his best to raise donations, made many comments on the matter of using suitable domestic paper for such printed materials. The original letter is recorded as follows: "In response, I have received your letter, along with temporary receipts and donation booklets. I am deeply moved by the compassion of you gentlemen for the wounded and devastated, your concern for the border, your joy in remembering suffering, and your ability to think of danger in times of peace. I, Shouzhi, am not talented, but I dare not fail to follow in the footsteps of you gentlemen, to contribute my modest efforts to fulfill the duty of a citizen. I will wait until I have collected a considerable amount before presenting it. However, I have noticed that the donation booklets, donation notices, brochures, and receipts used by your association are all Daolin paper imported from abroad. This may be a temporary oversight or carelessness, and not a deliberate intention. However, considering the patriotic and philanthropic enthusiasm of your association, such an omission is regrettable. Nowadays, our countrymen are vigilant about the danger of economic aggression by imperialists, and the national goods movement is spreading throughout the country. Machine-made improved domestic paper products are gradually increasing. For example, the Lian Shi, Mao Bian, and Hai Yue paper produced by the Jiangnan Paper Company are even superior to those imported from the East. Among them, the Hai Yue paper is particularly suitable for such printed materials due to its soft, tough, and smooth texture. However, it is often seen that various sectors, when publishing printed materials, often abandon suitable domestic paper and do not use it, as if foreign goods are necessary to meet their needs. What is the purpose of this? It is simply due to a momentary oversight and failure to examine habitual practices, which contradicts their usual aspirations. They do not realize that small leaks, if not stopped, will become rivers and oceans, and great wastes result from small drops. The decline of our national livelihood and the decay of industry are rooted in this subtle negligence. It is hoped that we will thoroughly awaken, take practical steps, act diligently, not make empty statements to seek fame, and not neglect small acts of goodness. This will enable national goods to be gradually promoted and foreign goods to be rejected without explicit resistance. Our country's economic future may then have a chance. I offer these thoughts for your consideration, hoping that they are not contrary to the patriotic and philanthropic enthusiasm of you gentlemen. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai All-Circles Fundraising Association for Disaster Relief for War-Affected Areas and慰勞 Frontline Soldiers."</p>

<h3 id="e135">Three Ships Salvaging the Kangtai Sank <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Three Ships Sank in the Wind</p>
<p>All Nineteen People Fell into the Water</p>
<p>Survived Because of Their Good Swimming Skills</p>
<p>The Japanese company contracted by San Bing 洋行 of this port to salvage the Kang Qin sunken ship has been working since the start of the salvage, which is more than a month. The ship's machinery, boilers, and various engines have already been salvaged one after another. However, the hull is deeply embedded in the riverbed, making it difficult to retrieve. The Japanese used 1,000 pounds of dynamite for underwater blasting, causing the ship's bottom to break open and the wood to float. At that time, they hired two civilian boats (small traveling wind boats) to retrieve the wood. Unexpectedly, the Japanese ordered two wind boats, named "Mada Ahui", to be towed by their own chemical small wheel on the previous day. When they were salvaging the wood, suddenly at about 8 o'clock in the evening, a storm broke out, causing the chemical small wheel and the two wind boats to be difficult to support. Then they all capsized, and a total of nineteen boatmen and sailors on the three ships all fell into the water and drifted away. Fortunately, all the people knew the art of swimming. At that time, everyone used their strength to fight the waves and swim on the sea to escape from danger and not be with the wave officials. Subsequently, the salvage office of the bank learned of the news of the salvage office and immediately drove to the rescue and rescued all the people on the water. Among them, several people such as Zhang of the Fengfeng boat were either too frightened or because their bodies were concerned. They were unconscious and had cold limbs when rescued. After being rescued one by one, all the people who fell into the water were restored to their lives. The Mada Ahui chemical small wheel and a wind boat sank without a trace at the time. There is still a wind boat, although it was damaged by the storm and the giant waves, but because the rescue of the small fire wheel of Ruifeng was quick, the broken ship was towed to the stone embankment at that time, but the wind and waves were even more violent at night, resulting in the broken ship still sunk. It is heard that the bank lost more than a thousand taels this time, and the boss of the Mada Ahui medicine wheel, Tan Axi, lost even more.</p>

<p>One Son with Three Mouths</p>
<p>Shrunken Head, Fangs, Half a Leg</p>
<p>Li Xuehao from Yancheng, who lives at No. 1, Hong'an Lane, Hanzhong Road, Zhabei, is a stone mason at the ferry crossing of Binlang Road in the Public Concession, leaving early and returning late. His wife, Ms. Yan, is 36 years old and works hard at home. She has already given birth to three sons. Last year, during the remaining days of winter, the wife became pregnant. At 11:00 PM on the previous day (the 25th), it was time for her to give birth, but unexpectedly, she gave birth to a monstrous fetus, which was immediately thrown into the trash can at the entrance of the alley. When Xuehao sent the monster back, he was followed by a black cat. When he arrived at the room, the cat suddenly disappeared. Looking at his wife again, her abdomen was still swollen. The monster that was newly born had a very long head at first. After landing, it suddenly shrank. Both hands were attached to the side of the body and were quite small. Both legs were also straight and short. The nose was flat, and there were two mouths. There was still a hole in the back of the head, appearing like three mouths. The two mouths in the front were arranged in a row and both had fangs. The mouth at the back was unique. When asked if it was male or female, it was not possible to tell. The next morning (that is, yesterday morning) at about 8:00 AM, neighbors flocked to the trash can to see it, and all were surprised.</p>
<h3 id="e137">A Prisoner Accuses the Gang Leader <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Wang Ada, Whose Sentence Is About to Expire, Is Accused by Fellow Prisoners</p>
<p>Wang Ada from Ningbo conflicted with his fellow townsman Gu Baoxiang on Broadway Road on the 28th of last month, starting with an argument and then a fight. Gu was injured in the fight, and the Huishan Police Station detained Wang and sent him to the Special District Local Court, which sentenced him to 30 days of detention, to be served in the West Prison. His sentence would soon expire and he would be free. However, seven fellow prisoner thieves, Dai Anxiang, Shen Aqing, Yu Amao, Pan Meisheng, Shen Longyi, Zhang Acai, and Chen Acai, saw that Wang was in prison and confirmed that he was their leader. They feared that Wang would be released after his term expired and would remain at large. Therefore, they specifically accused him, saying that the pistols used by them when robbing merchants and residents of Xinjihang Road and Dongjiaxing Road were all supplied by Wang, and the stolen goods were also distributed by Wang. The western officer in charge of the prison reported this to his superiors. It was found that the seven thieves, including Dai, were arrested by Feng Zhiming, an investigator from the General Inspection Office of the General Patrol Room. In February of this year, the former Provisional Court sentenced them to 18 years of imprisonment each. Feng Investigator was ordered to bring Wang Ada back to the police station for investigation and prosecution. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special District Local Court. Judge Ge opened the court for interrogation. Feng then brought Dai and others to the case for verification. According to Dai, Wang Ada was indeed the leader of the thieves, supplying pistols and distributing the stolen goods on the spot. After we were arrested, we concealed this situation during the trial because of Wang's instructions. At that time, Wang also promised to hire lawyers to defend us and find ways to rescue us, but later he failed to do so, etc. The other six, including Yu Amao, were very hesitant in their testimony. Judge Ge then ordered that the seven prisoners, including Dai, be sent back to the West Prison. Wang Ada was detained for further interrogation.</p>

<p>Guowen News Agency reports that someone came to Shanghai from Zhujiajiao yesterday, talking about the looting of Jinjiazhuang, Dianshan Lake, in the southern township of Kunshan County. At 4:00 AM on the 25th of this month (the previous day), a large gang of bandit ships, totaling twenty-four, arrived. There were about two hundred bandits, all armed with long guns, who landed on the shore and searched houses one by one. They shot and killed Mr. Gu Da, a gentleman, on the spot, and robbed four long guns and one box cannon from the local self-defense team. They also kidnapped more than ten people, including Gu Shoude, Gu Yudong, Zhu Jinshou (over eighty years old), Zhu Aliang, the son of Li Cairu, and the mother of Hu Wenlan. At 9:00 AM, they assembled and left, having searched for four hours. No large or small household was spared. Subsequent investigations revealed that clothing, jewelry, silver dollars, and other items worth about 10,000 yuan were looted. Before leaving, the bandits threatened to return to loot again if the village did not hand over 150,000 silver dollars within four days.</p>

<p>The Harbin Citibank Case</p>
<p>Return the Remaining Balance of the Harbin Electric Company's Deposit</p>
<p>The Great American Evening Post reports that the Harbin Electric Joint Stock Company sued the American Court Envoy Office in this port to order Citibank in Harbin to return the remaining balance of the deposit of Hada Yang 49,680.81 yuan. The American Envoy has ruled that Citibank should return the full amount to the plaintiff. It is reported that the entanglement in this case lies in the signature procedure. The Harbin Electric Company previously signed a contract with the American BKM Company to build a power plant and tram line, and deposited money in Citibank in Harbin to guarantee the payment of the goods when due, and agreed with the bank that the payment could only be made with the joint signatures of both parties. Later, the two parties disagreed on the issue of fulfilling the contract, and the BKM Company terminated the project and withdrew its representative stationed in Harbin. Both parties agreed that the contract was invalid, but the remaining balance of the deposit could not be paid due to the signature procedure, and therefore the lawsuit was filed in court.</p>

<p>Clear Rewards and Punishments...Each District Team Exerts Effort</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol and the police from the Sixth District worked together in the 艒艒boats on the Suzhou River to rescue Mr. Huang Bohui, President of the Times, from danger, as detailed in various newspapers. Yuan Liang, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, praised the Water Patrol Captain Xu Jishi for his quick handling and effective dispatch, and Ren Leping, Director of the Sixth District Public Security Office, for his courage to take responsibility and careful arrangements, which were truly diligent in their duties. Each was awarded a merit citation, and 500 yuan was allocated from the bureau for distribution to the police officers who had exerted effort in the incident, as an encouragement. Mr. Huang Bohui, as a token of gratitude, specially made several silver爵銀盾 to give to Director Yuan, Director Ren, Captain Xu, Second Patrol Officers Li and Xu, Patrol Captain Ma, and the four patrolmen Hao, Xie, Liu, and Yuan who boarded the boat to capture the kidnappers. Since Director Yuan took office, the reorganization of police affairs has made great progress. Specific reward and punishment measures have been established for personnel in each district, which were unprecedented before. Therefore, the district teams are very serious in their work and can show an innovative spirit. It is said that the head of a certain district was immediately dismissed from his post when a kidnapping case occurred in his jurisdiction, and the punishment for theft cases is very severe. The patrol police officers dare not slacken their duties. It is no wonder that Shanghai is able to maintain law and order in this turbulent era.</p>

<p>Negotiations on the Ban on Chinese Laborers</p>
<p>The Singapore colonial government announced on July 31 that Chinese laborers would be banned from landing on the Malay Peninsula for eight or nine months. It also announced that child laborers under the age of 14 would not be allowed to land during these three months. The Singapore Consul General Tang Liu telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting serious negotiations with the governments of these countries to avoid affecting the labor community. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee held that Singapore is the gateway to the Malay Peninsula and is not only the necessary transit point for overseas Chinese coming to the Malay Peninsula but also the hub of Euro-Asian transportation. Now that the ban on the entry of Chinese laborers has been announced, all adult Chinese laborers who have immigrated from China are calculated in Singapore. After calculation, they can transfer to Penang Island for landing. Laborers are not allowed to land in other ports besides Singapore Penang and 嶮. If the above methods are not followed, they will be arrested immediately.

<p>Sentencing Pending in Case of Four Deaths by Burning</p>
<p>Li Tianmin Insists on Being Out</p>
<p>Co-habitant Testifies He Was Home</p>
<p>Li Tianmin, a man from Chaozhou, allegedly started a fire at his residence at 133 Yuanfang Road on the 5th of this month at 3:00 AM while preparing opium, resulting in the death of four people. The police arrested Li and brought him to the Special District Court. After several investigations, as reported in this newspaper, the case was heard again yesterday. The police lawyer stated that after the last hearing, the police sent detectives back to the fire scene to investigate and recovered an iron box belonging to the defendant, but there were no prohibited items inside. A small jar of liquid was also presented as evidence, and the judge was asked to examine whether it was opium, as suspected, or oil, as the defendant claimed. Subsequently, a Mrs. Liu testified, stating that the defendant was her husband's younger brother, whose real name was Liu Juemin, and was a teacher in Nanyang. The house on Yuanfang Road was originally rented by her husband for many years. Initially, there was a school in the house, so her family moved to 917 Donghan Bili Road five years ago. The defendant returned to Shanghai this time and stayed in the wing room downstairs of that house. That night, the defendant suddenly came to her house and knocked on the door. She opened the door and let him in, and saw that he was naked, with only a sweat shirt covering his lower body. When she asked him what happened, she learned that he had encountered a fire. She immediately told him to go inside and put on clothes. The defendant said that there were still important items in his room and went back to retrieve them, but he did not return for a long time, and then learned that he had been arrested by the police. The back of the house's parlor was rented to Qian Liangen, who had not moved in for long. The residents upstairs were mostly from Jianghuai. The defendant would make opium in the kitchen, she claimed. Then, Mr. Mai Er, a Westerner from the Hongkou Fire Brigade, described the situation of driving to the scene to put out the fire that night, stating that after investigation, the fire started around the stairs in the house. Jiang Shaokuang, a Chinese staff member of the brigade, testified that after the fire was extinguished that night, two copper pots used for preparing opium were found, and the charcoal in the stove was still burning. Subsequently, Qian Liangen, Wang Jinkui, Tian Chenshi, and Xiao Wang, residents of the house, each described what they saw. Qian insisted that he was at a relative's house that night and did not come home, so how could it be said that the fire started in his room? Wang Jinkui and others all said that Qian was indeed at home that night and had an argument with the residents upstairs because the washing water leaked from the upstairs floor into Qian's room. The defendant also testified that the fire started in Qian's room, and he woke up from a dream and was arrested in the alley after escaping. Finally, the lawyers for both parties concluded their arguments, and the court ordered the defendant to be detained to await sentencing.</p>

<p>Liu Shenglai, a fisherman from Daishan, Zhejiang, was transporting a boatload of government salt from Daiao to the Shanghai government salt depot. When he arrived at the Wusongkou the day before yesterday, Yu Xiasheng's sand dredger from Sijiao collided with the salt boat due to careless navigation. The tide immediately rushed in, wetting the government salt, resulting in a significant loss. Yu Xiasheng knew he was at fault after causing the accident, but claimed it was unintentional. In addition to hiring a boat to transport the remaining intact government salt to Shanghai for delivery, he also intended to plead with the depot to handle the matter lightly and exempt him from compensating for the losses.</p>

<p>A Large Cable Leads to the Arrest</p>
<p>Zhang Yuting, a detective from the Shanghai Municipal Police Department's Water Patrol Team, was patrolling the Huangpu River near Zhangjiabang Pier in Pudong at about 4:00 AM yesterday when he found a suspicious客船. He boarded the boat to investigate and found a large cable in the boat, about eight inches in diameter and more than ten yards long. He asked the boatman what the cable was for. The boatman said it belonged to passengers Jin Akang, Wang Apin, and Gui Aquan. When questioned about the origin of the cable, Jin Akang and others hesitated, so all the people and evidence were taken to the team. During preliminary interrogation by Chief Xu, the boatwoman Wang Yangshi stated that the cable was transferred to her boat by Jin Akang and others from a coal boat. She said that Jin and others had previously hired her boat to transport ten barrels of paint and lead wire rope to the Laobaidu Pier in Puxi, and then Jin and others sold them all at the Kunhe Hardware Store, so they knew each other and she transported the cable for them, but she did not know where the cable came from. When questioned, Jin and others claimed that the cable was stolen from a certain ship in the Huangpu River and admitted to stealing paint and other items and selling them to the Kunhe Hardware Store. It was discovered that Jin Akang and others were habitual thieves, and the Kunhe Hardware Store specialized in receiving stolen goods, which was extremely abhorrent. The store owner, Gu Akun, was summoned to the case, and it was ordered to prepare a document and submit it to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

Li Defu was standing outside waiting with his bag of clothes when three or four thugs came up and tried to snatch the bag. Li resisted, and the thugs gathered to more than twenty people. Holding watermelon knives, they stabbed Li once in the abdomen, causing his intestines to protrude, and once in the right arm, causing very serious injuries. He went to Tongren Hospital for treatment. The thugs opened the stolen package and found only two sets of short shirts and pants, and nothing else of value, so they abandoned them on the ground and fled.</p>

<p>Jiang Jiayun, a native of Wuxi, used to work in a rice shop in Wuxi. He resigned and came to Shanghai with his wife and three children in February, renting a house on Wuzhen Road in Zhabei. Jiang was recommended by a relative to work as a cargo manager at a foreign warehouse in Pudong. However, life in Shanghai was difficult, and his salary was not enough to cover expenses, resulting in two months of rent arrears. Recently, due to financial problems, the couple often quarreled. One Sunday, Jiang was resting at home when, for some reason, the couple quarreled again. At that time, his friend Li came to his house to ask for a loan. Jiang had no money to pay him and was ridiculed by Li. Jiang was very angry and, feeling embarrassed, decided to end his life. That night, he went to a certain opium den and bought half a yuan's worth of opium, brought it home, and swallowed it in the room. When the poison took effect in the middle of the night, he moaned incessantly. His wife noticed that his face had turned pale and rushed him to the hospital.

<p>Car Accident Awaits Sentencing</p>
<p>Liu Daoyou, a man from Jiangbei, made a living driving cars. Although his skills were not extremely bad, he was careless and drove arbitrarily fast. Recently, he was summoned by the Special District Court and fined ten yuan for disobeying a traffic police officer. However, not long after the punishment, he caused a major accident on the 23rd of this month at 3:00 PM, killing one person and injuring two others. At that time, Liu was driving a fully loaded truck with the number 16665 on Baker Road. On the sidewalk next to the road was an old woman from Yancheng, Chen Liu, who was sleeping there because of the heat. Liu suddenly drove onto the sidewalk, and the wheels crushed the old woman's head, waist, and back, killing her instantly. He continued to drive away quickly, causing two passing men to be knocked down. A bamboo fence next to the road was also crashed into a hole. The Chinese police officer No. 205 saw the scene, sent the two injured men and women to the morgue and hospital, respectively, and arrested Liu. The court examined the body and ordered it to be coffined. The police filed a public prosecution against Liu for causing death. Yesterday morning, Judge Ge Zhiqin proposed a trial. Chen Xiaolou, the son of the deceased, arrived in court and described the tragic death of his mother, requesting that the matter be handled strictly. However, the injuries of the two injured men were not fatal, and they had recovered in the hospital and returned to their hometown in Kunshan. According to police lawyer Zhang Tianyin, the defendant drove his car so carelessly and treated human life like a game, making it very unsafe for pedestrians. He requested a severe punishment to warn others. The defendant stated that at that time, someone suddenly ran out of an alley and crossed the road, and he wanted to avoid this person, so he drove the car to the side of the road, resulting in the accident, which was not intentional. After hearing the case, Judge Ge ordered Liu Daoyou to be detained to await sentencing.</p>

<p>One Thief and Stolen Goods Intercepted</p>
<p>Sentencing Postponed for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>Ren Yutian, who worked as a movie actor, lived at 1109 Xin Mali, Mahe Road. At about 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, Ren was still in bed when five robbers suddenly came in, each holding a pistol. They swarmed in, first driving Ren's five family members to a corner, ordering them to be silent, and then began to search and ransack, flipping over boxes and cabinets for a quarter of an hour, looting gold jewelry, clothing, and other items, and then fleeing out with a whoop. Ren's relative Shen Yugui arrived from outside, saw the situation, turned around and chased after them, shouting for thieves. The thieves, fearing that fleeing together would attract the attention of passersby and be intercepted, scattered and fled in different directions. One thief from Jianghuai, named Gu Zhenhua, did not hide his firearm, but held it in his hand and ran towards the concession. When he reached the corner of 246 Kaizier Road, Songshan Road, he was stopped by Shun Yizi and Liu Yushan. Gu was a gatekeeper hired by the resident of No. 246, and Liu was the resident's bodyguard. At that time, they were both enjoying the cool air in front of the door, and they saw Gu Zhenhua running wildly with a weapon in his hand. They suspected that he was not a good person, so they raised their pistols to stop him from moving forward. Gu knew that it was difficult to resist and surrendered. He was handed over to the nearby French police station. After interrogation by the police chief, it was found that the thief's gun had eight bullets, and four pieces of gold jewelry were found on his person. After a while, the Zhabei police station learned that a thief had been caught and sent detective Zhao Qingkui to cooperate with the Western detective to request the French police station to transfer him. Permission was granted. Gu Zhenhua, along with the pistol bullets and gold jewelry, was taken back together. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special District Court, where Judge Sun Yuan opened the court for interrogation. After the police lawyer Wang Yaotang described the case, he requested a postponement because there were still accomplices at large, so that they could be tracked down. Ren Yutian, the victim, explained the situation of the robbery at that time, stating that the stolen property was worth more than 80 yuan, and the four pieces of gold jewelry recovered were indeed the stolen goods. When questioned, Gu Zhenhua directly admitted to forming a gang, holding weapons to rob and dividing the spoils, but said that the pistol he was holding belonged to a surname Ma, who was on the run. Judge Sun ordered Gu to be taken back to the police station for detention and adjourned the hearing to another date.</p>

Just as he left the alley, he was suddenly stabbed three times in the left chest, right shoulder, and right arm by an enemy using a sharp blade. The murderer fled after achieving his goal. Zhu was injured and went to the Da Ziminzhong Police Station and was transferred to Renji Hospital. He died at 9:30 AM due to excessive blood loss. The hospital notified the police station, who transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuantang morgue for an autopsy. Subsequently, the family submitted a request to the police station for exemption from the autopsy. The police chief approved it and ordered them to quickly collect the body for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Agricultural Inspection Bureau <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Explains Reasons for Inspecting Wheat</p>
<p>The Shanghai Agricultural Products Inspection Bureau of the Agricultural, Mining, and Industrial Bureau yesterday sent a letter to the Machinery Flour Mill Association explaining the inspection of wheat, stating that wheat is a major staple food, and in recent years, the sales of wheat in various ports have increased sharply. The practice of mixing cement and gravel has become increasingly serious, which not only hinders the hygiene of people's food, but also easily causes the quality to become moldy and rotten due to excessive water content. Mixing with gravel can easily damage the milling machine, and there is even a risk of fire. This causes great losses to manufacturers. As a result, the reputation of domestic wheat has gradually declined, and foreign wheat has taken the opportunity to enter the market, resulting in a huge outflow of money. This bureau is responsible for eliminating agricultural pests and is thinking about ways to improve the situation. It has now approved a letter from the Jiangsu Agricultural and Mining Department forwarded by the Shanghai Flour Industry Association, requesting strict prohibition of mixing cement and other substances into wheat. The bureau has reported this to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, ordering the Jiangbei Branch to first conduct trial inspections of wheat in the Jiangbei area, with the aim of gradually promoting it. Since the Jiangbei Branch began implementing the inspection, it believes that the results are still good, and it is beneficial to both the hygiene of people's food and the interests of manufacturers. However, it has received a letter from your association, stating that there are still four points that are not clear about the trial measures for inspecting wheat stipulated by this bureau. The following is a further explanation: (1) According to the general practice of inspecting agricultural products, it is carried out either at the time of import and export or at the time of transaction. It does not matter whether the cargo owner is a farmer or a merchant. According to the precedents of various countries, this is always the case. Moreover, the malpractices of mixing water and mud in wheat in our country are mostly caused by merchants and boatmen. Therefore, this bureau's inspection of wheat especially focuses on merchants and boatmen, which is the fundamental solution. (2) Shanghai is the center of the flour industry in the country, and Jiangbei is the most abundant wheat-producing area in our country. In addition to supplying some of the wheat produced to local flour mills, a large amount is also transported to Shanghai for sale. Since this bureau has a Jiangbei Branch, it should first order its implementation. Other places should be organized in order. It should be known that the national territory is very vast, and all administration can only be carried out gradually, and it is difficult to pass it all at once. (3) The trial measures for inspecting wheat stipulate the punishment of adulterated or counterfeit wheat, which is originally intended to ban through punishment and prevent unscrupulous merchants from following suit. It is clear that honest merchants will not engage in counterfeiting. However, this bureau cannot omit this article when formulating regulations to prevent unscrupulous people from knowingly violating them. It also deeply hopes that such facts will not be discovered, so that it is unnecessary to cite them as regulations, which will be of great benefit to the factory and will not be a hindrance. If the wheat transported by the factory is found to be unqualified and is indeed transported from elsewhere, and the situation is excusable, it should be ordered to find ways to improve it and purchase carefully in the future. If there is intentional violation, it should also be punished according to the regulations. National administration is to seek the interests of the public, and it is not convenient to condone a small number of people. (4)</p>
<p>This bureau handles the inspection administration in order to make up for the various facilities and procedural costs of implementing the inspection, and has to collect inspection fees. The nature of this fee is different from the special flour tax and wheat tax. According to the precedents of various countries, Japan, for example, charges each dan of wheat a fee of 4.5 to 8.9 points. However, the regulations of this bureau on the inspection of agricultural products stipulate that the inspection fee is only 2% of the value of the goods. Because this wheat inspection concerns the people's food and is a trial, it is especially considerate of the difficulties of merchants and the people, and has been approved by the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining to reduce the inspection fee to one cent per dan of wheat. According to the market price, it is less than two thousandths, which is very small and can only make up for the smallest part of the cost required to implement the inspection. Moreover, the wheat in our country is adulterated with water and mud, ranging from two or three catties to more than ten catties per dan. For example, if the factory purchases 1,000 dan of inferior goods, it will secretly lose 100 yuan. If it is inspected, the inferior goods will be eliminated, which can avoid secret consumption, and this small inspection fee seems to be the responsibility to bear. It is not like a special tax or wheat tax that can be compared. In summary, although the matter is a trial, the situation should be observed at any time and the regulations should be revised as appropriate to make it perfect. However, the four points raised in the letter feel that your association has not fully understood. The corresponding letter is replied, hoping that you will check it.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Proposal to Ban the Import of Japanese Cocoons <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Gu Suming, a member of the Jiaxing Chamber of Commerce, believes that the huge import of Japanese cocoons has a great impact on agricultural products. He sent a letter to Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Wang Yansong, a member of the Standing Committee, requesting that a proposal be submitted to find a way to stop it. The original letter stated that since countries such as France, Italy, and Japan suddenly rose to compete in the silk cocoon industry and surpassed China, foreign trade has fallen sharply, and there is almost no place for Chinese silk in the world market, which is heartbreaking to say. Fortunately, in recent years, the call for promoting domestic goods has been endless, and the improvement of silk fabrics has also made daily progress. Although it cannot win overseas, it can still continue to be held domestically. Unexpectedly, the alarming news came that a large number of Japanese dried cocoons were being transported to Shanghai for sale, which has become a reality. The first batch weighed 240,000 pounds, and after that, there will be a batch every seven days, with a total of 10,000 packages purchased. It will drive straight in, sell smoothly, and be seen rolling in, endlessly. Chinese silk cocoons will not only be rejected abroad, but will also be abandoned by the Chinese people. From then on, domestic cocoons will be equal to waste cotton, sericulture can be ignored, and national destruction and species extinction can be awaited. Japan takes China as its first economic invasion market in East Asia, and does everything possible. Taking advantage of the weakness of China's productivity and the weakness of merchants who are greedy for immediate profits, it takes the opportunity to demand whatever it wants, causing Chinese merchants to often enter its valleys without realizing it or being vigilant. This time, the import of Japanese cocoons has been said to have been purchased by various factories and deposited in customs warehouses for use in batches, which is of course purchased by Shanghai merchants. Is it a suicide policy or a goodwill policy? If we do not urgently seek relief and quickly stop it, from then on, our food and clothing will depend on others, and we will be at their mercy. It is unfavorable to Chinese cocoons, and it is also unfavorable to Chinese merchants. Farmers' production is deprived, and merchants' livelihoods are also cut off. I am afraid that drinking poison to quench thirst will not stop until everyone dies. For this reason, I urge you to submit a proposal to find a way to stop it, so that Japanese cocoons will no longer be imported, and to persuade Shanghai merchants to stop ordering them, in order to preserve the inherent production of this country and save the nearly exhausted vitality of farmers and merchants. It is heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is preparing to submit the letter to the current standing committee meeting to discuss the matter.</p>

<p>Assistance to Tenants Forcibly Evicted from Qingyun Lane</p>
<p>And Hope That the Landlord Will Wake Up Soon</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation issued a declaration yesterday regarding the forced eviction of tenants from Qingyun Lane in Hongkou. According to a letter from the Qingyun Lane Tenants' Federation in Hongkou, the Qingyun Lane property belongs to the New Sassoon Foreign Company. It has been less than thirteen years since it was built, and the existing houses are in good condition and do not need to be rebuilt. At the end of June, they received a notice from the landlord, limited to August 31, forcing them to move. The residents were all shocked when they heard the news. At this time of financial hardship, market depression, high prices, and economic depression, small-scale businesses have reached their limit. The landlord took advantage of the crisis to oppress them, forcing them to move, adding significant losses to the move at a time when they are trying to save themselves. Is this not putting the tenants to death? They repeatedly sent representatives to plead with the landlord to withdraw the order. However, the landlord forgot about righteousness for profit and had no compassion. The residents were forced to have nowhere to go and called for help. The landlord was greedy for profits and leased the Qingyun Lane houses to a certain large company, which had a profound impact on the future of society. The Qingyun Lane houses were rebuilt less than thirteen years ago, and the existing buildings are very solid. There is no need for rebuilding. Now, the landlord New Sassoon Foreign Company disregards business difficulties, ignores public opinion, and rashly forces tenants to move, which is contrary to human nature. It is also clear that someone is instigating from the middle. In order to protect the residents' housing and social security, this federation cannot allow them to be slaughtered. We sincerely hope that the landlord New Sassoon Foreign Company and the rent digger can wake up in time so that a peaceful solution can be reached. Otherwise, this federation will also be involved in the same matter, as it is our duty. This declaration is issued by the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation.</p>

On July 15, the west gate of the county town was attacked by bandits again, who burned, killed, looted, and caused countless losses. They took 158 hostages. On the night of July 18, Shilipu, ten miles west of the city, was attacked by bandits who occupied Duzhuang, burned and looted, and took more than 100 hostages. On the 28th, Dangtun in the east of the city was also captured by bandits, and the burning and killing were even more severe, causing even greater losses. Now, the 46th and 47th districts south of the Ru River are full of bandits, and it is difficult to escape or defend. They have no ability to redeem the hostages, and the dying victims are pleading for urgent relief. After investigation, the villages in Linru that were attacked by bandits are destitute and have no food. If no measures are taken to save them, the lives of the people cannot be expected to survive. I implore you to quickly allocate huge sums of money and ask major philanthropists to find ways to provide relief in order to save the survivors. This is our hope. Li Shican, President of the Henan Relief Association, kowtows. (2) According to the report from the Neihuang Relief Sub-Association, Neihuang is the poorest area in the north, and it has been plagued by years of military disasters and banditry, making life difficult for the people. In 1928, there were droughts and locusts, and in 1929, there were droughts, floods, and locusts, making the three disasters even more severe. Tens of thousands of victims abandoned their homes and went east to seek food. This spring, there was another political change, and the allocation of money and conscription of soldiers exhausted everything. They hoped to save their lives with the wheat harvest, but unexpectedly, strong winds and hail caused great damage, so that the wheat ears were all broken and there was no harvest. The young autumn seedlings were all damaged, and the autumn harvest was also hopeless. The survivors are dying and urgently need relief. We implore you to have great compassion and provide relief in order to save the victims. This is our prayer. Li Shican, Chairman of the Henan Relief Association, kowtows. It is heard that after receiving these two telegrams, Representative Zhou went to various charitable organizations to weep and seek relief, and also sent a list of the disasters in various counties to clarify the tragic situation.</p>

However, the scope of broadcasting will be limited to commerce. Political news will be completely excluded, with particular attention paid to exchange rates, market prices, and gold standard quotations, in order to make it a purely commercial radio station that can provide prompt news to the business community everywhere.</p>

<p>Wang Zhenmei is from Wuxi, nine years old. In April of this year, because her biological mother could not afford to raise her, she was sold for forty yuan to an old woman surnamed Jiang, a Wuxi native residing at No. 21 Gaozhao Lane, Xinzha Road, in this district, to be a foster daughter. Unexpectedly, although the old woman is over sixty, her ferocious nature has not changed. She often used cruel methods such as piercing with needles and scalding with water to abuse her foster daughter. Neighbors who disapproved of her behavior immediately reported it to the China Children's Welfare Association. Yesterday morning, the association sent staff members Wang Guanyi and Zhang Yueru to the destination to investigate the situation. They found that the girl still had injuries on her body, and from the neighbors, they learned that the abuse methods were indeed as previously reported. The two gentlemen then made a detailed record and took a photo for reference. They originally planned to take the girl away on the spot, but after finding out that her biological mother had come to Shanghai to claim her, they decided to postpone the decision on whether to take her in until her biological mother arrived in Shanghai. Currently, the girl is temporarily living with the Jin Tao Electric Company, a neighbor, so she should not suffer from abuse any longer. As for the punishment that the old woman deserves, it is said that the police have appropriate measures.</p>

<p>More than 20 groups including the Shanghai Xiangsheng Iron Factory Workers' Union, previously issued a declaration stating that they had found that Wu Yaoting and others had set up institutions to privately transport cash out of the country. Wu Yaoting and others yesterday replied separately to the labor unions explaining the misunderstanding, saying: To the Shanghai Xiangsheng Iron Factory Workers' Union, the Pudong Rihua Workers' Union Reorganization Committee, and other groups: Having read the report, the esteemed union's declaration stated that the undersigned and others were taking advantage of the situation to collude with foreign merchants, set up institutions, and privately transport cash out of the country, etc. However, the prohibition of cash exports has long been clearly promulgated by the National Government. The undersigned and others abide by the law and dare not violate it. However, the undersigned and others have been in the gold standard business for many years, buying and selling as a natural act of trading. It is appropriate to store cash when buying, and we operate in compliance with the regulations of the ministry-set exchange. Both the buyer and the seller are bound by the rules, and it is not an illegal act. The esteemed union should know that storing cash and privately transporting it out of the country are two completely different things. Since there is spot gold in Shanghai, how can no one receive it? If storing cash is equated with the crime of privately transporting it out of the country, that is unreasonable. The esteemed union's concern for the national economy and people's livelihood and its ambition to eradicate traitors are admirable. However, this concerns the reputation of the undersigned and others, and we cannot allow false accusations. The esteemed union does not understand the nature of the transaction and cannot arbitrarily slander us with the three characters "Yingshi You". We are deeply surprised and are sending this letter specifically in the hope that the esteemed union will clarify the misunderstanding and thoroughly investigate to clarify the truth. Awaiting your reply, respectfully, Wu Yaoting and Yu Shouzheng. Also, Wu Peichu's reply to the various labor unions states: (Omitted above) Having read the report, the esteemed union stated that the undersigned was taking advantage of the situation to privately transport cash out of the country, etc. As the undersigned has always worked in the bank, I have no knowledge of matters outside of my duties. I am surprised to be listed. I hope that the esteemed union will thoroughly investigate to clarify the truth. Respectfully, Wu Peichu.</p>

<p>Copper and Tin Industry: The Shanghai Copper and Tin Trade Association has been ordered to reorganize. Preparations have been completed, and the inaugural meeting was convened at the regular meeting room of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday. The meeting began at 2:15, with rituals as usual. Chairman Yu Futang reported on the merger and reorganization of the guild hall and the association, stating: Our industry established a guild hall in the late Qing Dynasty, with directors presiding over everything. After the revolution, a council was produced by the members. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, the association was established, and the General Chamber of Commerce was requested to report to the Ministry for registration. In the sixth year, funds were raised to rebuild the old site, so the association affairs could gradually develop. Unexpectedly, in the winter of the thirteenth year, it was occupied by Zhang Yunming's army, and it suffered greatly. The bad example has been set, and troops are still borrowing residence to this day, resulting in no fixed address, which is a great regret. Since being ordered to merge and reorganize into a trade association, after several months of preparation, it can be announced today. We are very honored that the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to attend for guidance and supervision. I hope that the fellow tradesmen present will work together, unite as one, relieve their own suffering, and enthusiastically create wealth for society, so as not to disappoint the enthusiasm of the representatives present. Next, the charter, totaling twenty-four articles, was discussed, and there were no objections from the public, and it was passed. Next, the executive committee members were elected by ballot. As a result, Tian Hexiang, Yu Futang, Yi Nanzhen, Feng Yongmei, Xia Juntang, Huang Chunquan, Yi Yaochang, Yi Qichang, Jin Keqing, Xiao Erjun, and Wang Lianfang were elected. They were immediately sworn into office. Next, a representative from the Citizen Training Association gave a training speech. The meeting adjourned at five o'clock.</p>
<p>Candle Industry: The Municipal Candle Industry Association believes that fellow traders add gifts every festival, which has become a custom. It is difficult to maintain the current situation without active rectification. Yesterday, all fellow traders were invited to a meeting to discuss the results: (1) The old habit of giving gifts in this industry is the beginning of price chaos, and it should be banned to facilitate rectification. (2) The case of member Sanhecheng Firm resisting payment of association fees has been dealt with according to law by the superior association, and it has been decided that they should still pay fees in accordance with the regulations. If the firm continues to be contemptuous, it will be reported to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the judicial authorities for legal punishment. The meeting adjourned after discussion.</p>
<p>Hotel Industry: The Shanghai Hotel Industry Association of Hele Lane, Fuzhou Road, sent its 80th official letter yesterday to the Shanghai Public Concession Taxpayers' Association, stating: I hereby report that our association members, including Yao Shengsan of the Southern Hotel and more than ten other hotels, have written letters stating that the number of hotels in Shanghai's industry was not as numerous as it is today ten years ago. In business, supply and demand were originally commensurate, so in addition to expenses, there was always some surplus. In recent years, due to the investment of investors who do not understand the social and economic organization, there has been an oversupply of hotels, and business has plummeted. Not only can most hotels' businesses not maintain expenses, but the losses are increasing year by year after the annual settlement. I am afraid that if this continues and no remedy is sought, and the pain of increased rent, increased staff salaries, increased tax burdens, and unstable times is added, they will inevitably close down. Such consequences are unimaginable. The members felt the danger and could not remain silent. Therefore, they are writing to request that you promptly send a letter to the Taxpayers' Association, which will then send a letter to the Public Works Department, urging them to restrict the increase in the number of hotels. If a hotel comes to apply for a license, it should be rejected in order to leave a bit of business for hotel merchants, preserve their capital, and avoid mass bankruptcy and social panic. The situation is so important. I hereby request that your association review and approve this proposal, or send a letter to the board of directors of the Public Works Department, requesting them to consider the decline in hotel business and the danger of increasing numbers within the boundary, approve the restriction of hotels from increasing from today, and not issue licenses indiscriminately again, in order to maintain the business of the original hotels within the boundary, fulfill the obligation of taxpayers, and ensure the economic stability of society.</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>Sir, in the local news column of your newspaper on the 26th of this month, there was a message from our bureau, roughly saying that after the announcement of the successor of Deputy Director-General Cai, he ordered the departments to rush to hand over, and that Mr. Cai had not been to the bureau since yesterday. Since the National Government ordered Chen Xizeng to temporarily act as the Director-General of the General Management Office and to act as the commissioner, because Deputy Director-General Chen has not yet taken office, all bureau affairs are still the responsibility of Deputy Director-General Cai, who supervises the departments and proceeds as usual. Although Deputy Director-General Cai was unable to attend yesterday due to illness, the daily events were still handled by Secretary-General Wang on his behalf. He will still go to the bureau today to await handover. The content of your newspaper does not match the facts. Please correct it. We are deeply grateful. To the Shenbao, the General Management Office of China Merchants Bureau.</p>
<p>Sir, I have read the conversation of rice industry leader Lu Wenshao in today's newspaper regarding the situation of hosting plain rice. It mentions that Mr. Yu Qiaqing raised 500,000 yuan to host 100,000 piculs of plain rice, and that the first batch of 15,000 piculs of rice has arrived in Shanghai, with 12,000 piculs distributed to the original plain rice distribution points. All rice grains for the fair-priced rice hosted by our association are directly purchased by the association. The rice brought by Mr. Yu has not been entrusted to our association for sale. The facts are inconsistent, and the corresponding letter is hereby sent, requesting immediate correction to avoid misunderstandings. To the Shenbao, Rice Fair Price Committee, August 26.</p>

<h3 id="e178">A Glimpse of Ma Fuxiang Passing Through Wuhu on His Return to the Province <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Sent from Wuhu by Xueqian</p>
<p>Chairman of Anhui Province, Mr. Ma Fuxiang, has been residing in the capital for a long time since taking office, without returning to the province. Recently, due to the reorganization of the provincial party headquarters, he had to make a trip back to Anhui to reorganize everything. Coincidentally, Director of the Department of Finance, Sun Shengwu, was in Beijing on the 22nd after contacting the Shanghai banking community for a loan, so they returned to the province together.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma and Mr. Sun took the Jiangxin, a China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship, that day. The Jiangxin is one of the four first-class ships of China Merchants (the others being Jianghua, Jiang’an, and Jiangshun). The decorations are quite good, and although it is old, its sailing power is not weak. It departed at around 11:00 AM that day and arrived in Wuhu at 2:25 PM. The various agencies in Wuhu had already received telegrams and made preparations. Tang Shaogao, the director of the Municipal Police Bureau, had dispatched over a hundred members of the Special Operations Brigade of the Public Security Bureau to be stationed around the China Merchants’ cargo dock in advance. Twenty additional police officers were also deployed on the dock to maintain order. Before 2:00 PM, Shao Yizhou, the director of the Municipal Preparatory Office, County Magistrate Sun Gongming, and Director Jin, the representative of the Bank of China, had arrived at the port one after another. Police Chief Tang also wore his military uniform and supervised everything with the head of the special operations brigade and the inspectors. At 2:20 PM, the ship was approaching the shore, and the police band on the shore played music loudly. Mr. Ma, his wife, daughter, and Director Sun all stood on the port side of the deck. Mr. Ma leaned on the ship's railing with one hand, wearing a light lake-colored gauze long gown, with his bald head uncovered, and frequently nodded to the shore, while talking to his wife from time to time. Madam Ma wore a white qipao and waved a goose feather fan, with a very leisurely attitude. Director Sun wore a white silk long gown, with glasses framed with tortoise shell, his long hair unkempt, standing on the deck with his hands behind his back, about ten steps away from Mr. Ma. Five or six armed guards stood to the left and right. As the ship approached the dock, they successively returned to their cabins. The heads of the various agencies were the first to board the ship and bowed to Mr. Ma in the large dining room. Mr. Ma returned the greetings one by one and sat in the chairman's seat at the large dining table, inquiring about each of the visitors. Soon, Mr. Li Laosan, a reporter from the Wuhu Wanjiang Daily, and leaders of the Chamber of Commerce came to pay their respects. In total, there were fifty or sixty people. The ship stayed for about two hours before gradually leaving the port amidst the music of the military band. Mr. Ma and Mr. Sun still stood on the deck to return the greetings of those who were seeing them off.</p>
<h3 id="e179">A Word on Bare Feet in Guangzhou <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Juncai</p>
<p>In the article "Visiting the Empress of the Sea" in this column on the 15th, it was mentioned that there were three aristocratic and fashionable Western women with natural bare feet, not wearing silk stockings. It was said that this was the most fashionable attire for women in Western countries, which attracted the attention of all Chinese people at the time, and that Shanghai women would soon compete to imitate it. The body and limbs are received from one's parents and are inherently pure and need not be concealed. Moreover, people's hands are often exposed, while their feet are covered with socks. Why is there such unequal treatment of hands and feet? It is speculated that the Western women's intention in not wearing socks is also to show the natural beauty of their feet. Whether this kind of dress is beautiful and hygienic is another question. However, it has been seen in Guangzhou, China, for a long time. Today, the West calls it fashionable, which is somewhat laughable. However, the fashion of not wearing socks in Guangzhou did not originate among the aristocracy, but among maids, which is a slight difference.</p>
<p>Wealthy families in Guangzhou employ two types of maids. Those who are responsible for sweeping and other menial tasks are called "dazha" (general help), while those who specialize in folding quilts and making beds and serving the mistress are called "jinshen" (personal attendants). Those who fill the role of personal attendant mostly come from the "self-combed" class (in Cantonese, women who do not marry are called "self-combed"). They are in their late teens or early twenties, with shapely figures. Their winter clothes are light blue cloth, and their summer clothes are black silk, each costing more than ten yuan. They are tailored to fit the body and are elegant and lovely. However, they do not wear socks throughout the year, and their black satin slippers with felt soles expose their heels. The delicate flesh catches the eye. Their ability to achieve this beauty is due to artifice. Every morning, they use pumice stone to rub their heels smooth, and then apply face powder and a little rouge, like a painter applying colors, matching them appropriately, so they appear clean, white, and bright. They look like lotus roots emerging from the water. The beauty of these natural bare feet is probably not inferior to that of Western women.</p>
<p>The original intention of personal maids not wearing socks is unknown. However, considering that their work is leisurely, it is not due to occupational reasons. They can wear black silk outfits costing more than ten yuan, so they certainly cannot be without a pair of socks costing a few cents. It can be seen that it was not initially a matter of money. However, it has been done for a long time without anyone praising it. Now that Western women imitate it, it attracts the attention of the people of the country. In general, the same dress or hobby is called civilization if it comes from a strong country, but it is called barbarism if it is seen in a weak country. This is often the case, so why is the simple matter of not wearing socks any different?</p>
<h3 id="e180">A Record of the Joint Celebration at Liwa Lida Manor <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiping</p>
<p>A garden party seems to be a very new term. Recently, various groups in Shanghai, when encountering any anniversary, send invitations to people from all walks of life to visit pre-arranged, relatively elegant places, such as parks, lakes, mountains, or beautiful villages, so that people who have lived in noisy markets for a long time can absorb fresh air and cultivate their minds. This is indeed a very meaningful event.</p>
<p>The Photography Pictorial held a reader's gathering on August 24, and designated "Liwa Lida Manor" (Villa Riro Rita) in western Shanghai as the site of the garden party. I have always been very interested in garden parties, especially "Liwa Lida Manor," which I had never set foot in before, which aroused my curiosity. At about 4:00 PM, I boarded the car and set off. The car passed the Fanhuangdu Station and reached the end of Jessfield Road. After crossing the Suzhou River, we arrived at our destination. We walked through a shady path about a hundred meters long and stepped into the garden gate, turning to rest on the grass by the stream. A total of over two hundred guests arrived one after another. The other hundred were all blond and blue-eyed. They were regular customers. There were very few Chinese visitors. This time, the gathering of men and women can be considered the first time ever.</p>
<p>After we found our seats, we took photos, rowed boats, and chatted, each doing as they pleased. The grass by the river, which was about two acres in size, was filled with guests. I felt that women were the most powerful in this kind of gathering. They wore colorful clothes, revealed kind and pleasant expressions, and emitted bursts of莺声燕语 (pleasant sounds like orioles and swallows), which was indeed a good source for regulating the beautiful life between the two sexes. If the gathering were purely of the same sex, it would definitely be less colorful. At that time, there were also several Western women wearing swimsuits, constantly appearing in our sight. They rowed boats, swam, or lay on the grass, or hugged each other, their postures natural, as if showing off their abundant muscles to others. There were also many well-known people among the guests. Chen Jian, the recently retired director of the Ministry of Education, also strolled in the garden, with a leisurely attitude, presumably also happy to be at the garden party.</p>
<p>The owner of "Liwa Lida Manor" is the Russian Korolev. There are vegetable gardens and ridges all around. There are two open spaces with shallow grass in the garden, where people can play ball. The flowers and trees are luxuriant, and the air is fresh. To the west of the venue is a stream that is not connected to the Suzhou River. The stream is about ten feet deep, and the water is quite clear. It is very comfortable to row a boat or swim in the water. In the middle is a small Western-style house. Every night, Westerners come here to dine or dance. However, the materials are still very simple. This villa is not in the concession, but the entrance is marked with No. I Jessfield Road, which does not match the "No. 1 on the north bank of the Suzhou River" compiled by the Public Security Bureau. This is another evidence of the Municipal Council building roads beyond its boundaries. Although this is a small point, we do not seem to be able to neglect it.</p>
<p>Small Report: Pingbao Newspaper Office in Yuren Lane, Yunnan Road, in order to give preferential treatment to subscribers, in addition to giving away a copy of "Yan Zhihu" or "The Original Face" for each year of subscription, one phonograph and a dozen records will also be given for every hundred subscribers. The first group has already been announced. According to the last two digits of the number of the first special prize of the Wanguo Beichu Society in August, those who have the same last two digits as the number of the subscription form will get a phonograph and a dozen records. The last two digits of the first special prize of this Wanguo Savings Association in August are 83. It has been found that it was won by the Second Battalion of the Huainan Smuggling Suppression Navy. The newspaper has already purchased phonographs and records from Baidai Company to give to subscribers. In addition, the newspaper has recently been greatly improved. Such as Zhao Tieqiao Anecdotes, and Crude Oil Is Expensive, and Jin Chao's various articles are extremely valuable. And the social novel "The First Beauty's Romantic History" written by Shulu Shufang is published in each issue, which is extremely insightful. The method of giving preferential treatment to subscribers is still in effect. A reward will be given once every one hundred subscribers.</p>
<p>News from the Publishing World: Zhang Genong from Dantu has a new social novel called "Love Sea Tide." The content is rich, and there are signatures and prefaces by Jiang Hongjiao, Xu Xingchu, Yao Gengkui, Ma Xiezong, and others from the Shanghai news industry. It is said that each book is priced at four yuan, but a special price of only two yuan is offered, and a copy of Baihua, a love letter in brocade cover written by Zhu Songlu of Yunyang, is also included. The general distribution office is the Daya Bookstore diagonally opposite the south end of the Shenbao Newspaper Office on Wangping Street in this city.</p>
<h3 id="e181">An Analysis of the Recent Political Turmoil in Germany (Middle) <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Li Liuceng, sent from Paris</p>
<p>After the incident, the political situation in Berlin suddenly became chaotic. The Social Democratic Party was most satisfied with the final voting results in the parliament, because the motion to revoke the government order proposed by the party was declared established by a vote of 236 to 221. The new tax law issued by the cabinet on the 16th based on the constitution could not take effect as a result. However, since President Hindenburg has given the cabinet full power, the implementation of this new tax is to fill the gap in national expenditure, which the cabinet believes is an urgent matter. Therefore, the same order will be issued again in a different way next week. Based on this, the goal of the majority of members of parliament to avoid the implementation of the new tax has not been achieved. However, in terms of public opinion, these members can not bear any responsibility for the implementation of the new tax, whether it is justified or not. It is most important for political parties to concentrate on gaining public opinion in elections, because the public often hates new taxes.</p>
<p>After examining the final voting results of this parliament, we can know the general situation of the various political parties in Germany today. The majority of 236 votes is composed of the Social Democratic Party, the Communist Party, the Nationalist Party, and the Racialist Party (Racistes). Among these political parties, except for the Racialist Party, which is a reactionary political party, and the Communist Party, which is an active revolutionary party, we will not discuss them for the time being. The Social Democratic Party pays more attention to the parliamentary system and democratic order. As for the Nationalist Party led by Xiao Zhenbo, it is similar to the Italian Fascist Party, and is obsessed with military politics. However, in this turmoil, the failure of the Nationalist Party is the same as that of the cabinet. During the voting, the party was divided into two parts. Twenty-five people did not listen to Xiao Zhenbo's orders and followed Duke Westarp to vote in favor of the government. Therefore, the division of the German Nationalist Party this time is a definite fact. We can predict that the Nationalist Party members of the Westarp and Trevinanus factions will soon gather to form a new right-wing political party. Xiao Zhenbo's actions in this incident are tantamount to building a tomb for his party. His dictatorial ideas will inevitably lead to disintegration. In this parliamentary vote, the party was important and had the possibility of cooperating with the cabinet. Xiao did not know how to use the opportunity to incorporate the party's strength into the cabinet, but instead put forward various unacceptable conditions, resulting in a stalemate. It can also be said that he lacked political skills.</p>
<p>Many people believe that this incident is a major crisis for the German republic, constitution, and parliamentary systems. For ten years, dissolving parliament to seek the development of the political situation is the fourth time. It is a dangerous sign of the parliamentary system that the various political parties cannot stabilize the government and implement a policy that is beneficial to the country. The fact that the Brüning cabinet's prudent reform method for finance is the most important plan for Germany today is an indisputable fact. It is incomprehensible that the various political parties lack political courage and do not want to bear joint responsibility in this necessary reform plan, but instead force the government to abandon its specific plans or even adopt similar dictatorial last resorts.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 13: Who Unintentionally Sows Fortune and Gains a Diamond Ring; Only This Cause and Effect Sings the Song of the Golden Thread with Intent</p>
<p>That day, the banquet ended very late. Of course, I couldn't go to Hundred Flowers Lane. The next day, when Zuo Shichen arrived at the newspaper office, he found a strange letter among the many letters. It was a small, thin red slip envelope. Below it were written the three words "Name: In detail." Zuo Shichen thought to himself, "Who is inviting me to a brothel again?" Because that kind of envelope is known at a glance as a common item in brothels. They don't need sturdy and elegant envelopes, and writing "Name: In detail" on the outside has also become a habit, similar to writing a "Know" character in the signature place of a guest ticket. Zuo Shichen opened it and saw that it was indeed a guest ticket, from Chan Nong's house in Hundred Flowers Lane. Below it was noted the character "Three," so he knew that it was sent by Chan Nong. The characters were written worse than those of a character-splitting fortune teller, probably by the accountant in their place. On the side of the guest ticket were four other characters, written: "Please come and eat crabs." When Zuo Shichen saw these four characters, he thought of her living by Yangcheng Lake. Every year, her family often sent several large baskets of big crabs to share with her regular customers. Now it was time to hold crabs and admire chrysanthemums. He remembered that one year, there was a painter named Yin who was a guest of Cui Yun. Because he ate Cui Yun's crabs, he wanted to paint a picture of "Frosty Claws" to hang in Cui Yun's dressing room. Cui Yun quickly said no. Hanging a picture of several crabs in the room would make people say she was an old crab. Therefore, Old Master Yin changed the painting to chrysanthemums. I say this is a bit of an elegant person's deep understanding, exchanging crabs for chrysanthemums, like Wang Xizhi exchanging paintings for geese. Now that I think about it, her transition from the Cui Yun era to the Chan Nong era really means becoming an old crab. That day, he finished his daily routine business hurriedly. When he could feel his way to 9 o'clock, he came to Hundred Flowers Lane. Although he heard that business was not very good, it was still an upstairs room, with a side room and a pavilion. However, because there were not many customers who came to chat, the lights were not very bright, so it was inevitably a bit dim. Chan Nong hid in that pavilion, wearing a light blue bamboo cloth vest, making a short velvet cord shirt. She put a rose-purple velvet cord ball in the interlayer of the vest. When she saw Zuo Shichen come in, she half raised her body, welcomed him with a smile, and said, "Why did you come so late? I've been waiting for you for a long time." There was an old woman in the room, who was an old person from the Cui Yun era. Zuo Shichen remembered that she was from Luxu, Wujiang. He secretly thought that people who eat brothel food are just like their warlords. If they don't leave the mountain, they're fine, but when they do, they will naturally summon their old troops, and use their old subordinates. Hearing that someone had come out of the mountain again, they would naturally come to return. Sometimes they would even encourage their old masters to come out of the mountain so that they could manipulate power and profit. This time, Cui Yun came out of the mountain, wouldn't it also be encouraged by them?</p>

<p>Drastic Fluctuations in the Gold Market</p>
<p>Rise and Fall... Exceeded Twenty-Three Taels</p>
<p>Conclusion... Rose Thirteen Taels Two</p>
<p>Entirely Dominated by Air; Yesterday, the 26th, the gold market situation had drastic changes, with signs of a renewed high. There were latent opportunities of ten taels, but the waves were turbulent and the momentum was unstoppable. The total rise and fall of the day was more than twenty-three taels. The psychology of the industry was panic-stricken, because it was dominated by air. The foreign exchange market had already lengthened by one gear, but the domestic market tended to be firm, which was a clear picture of looseness on the surface and tightness underneath. The market was divided in buying and selling, and large firms such as Yuan Xing, Yongzhi, Fengyong, Hengxing, Yu Da, etc., came in and out suddenly. As for the silver price, although it rose, it did not move, so the morning market was stable. Later, the exchange rate was long and turned to a low peak. The firms sold together, once breaking 550 taels. However, Yu Da, Yuan Xing, Yong, etc., flocked to buy, and the exchange rate became superior. In particular, the bank telegrams from Mumbai continued to sell silver, so the market atmosphere became sharp and climbed, soaring more than ten taels. Later, the buying intention of Shi Yuan, Sheng, Yu Da, Heng Xing, Yuan Xing, Yong, etc., was very strong, and the public's confidence was strengthened. The exchange rate was even better, and it had exceeded the 570 tael mark. However, there were floating states, because of the stimulation of buying and selling, and finally it reduced by five or six taels, between sixty-seven taels. The silver bar went back up by one-fourth, and the silver price also increased by three-fourths.</p>
<p>Morning Market Wild Retreat and Advance; The opening price of gold in October was 555 taels and 4 qian, an increase of 1 tael and 8 qian. The firms had all entered. Then, it increased to 58 taels 7 or 8 qian. The first announcement was still flat, at 58 taels 4 qian. It was learned that it was long 25, US dollars half a yuan, Japanese gold reduced by 1.75 points. The domestic market also seemed to be loose. Sumitomo first bought November 7 pence 5625, December 6875. Then, the Wheat Company issued November 5625, and Zhifeng, Yongda, Decheng, Yuanxing, Yong, etc., tended to sell, and the price almost went downhill, falling sharply by 10 taels, and finally reaching 49 taels and 5 qian after 10 o'clock. It returned to two or three taels in a moment. After a while, the large households entered again. In particular, large silver bars had the ability to fall again, so they rushed straight into the sky and rose sharply. It had rushed out of 60 taels. By noon, it had risen by more than 15 taels. It closed at 64 taels and 7 qian, and it was linked for more than ten minutes. It was raised to 67 or 8 taels. The announced price had been changed to 627 taels. Because Japanese gold was less than 1.75 points, it was initially suppressed by about 70 taels, noon was 62 or 3 taels.</p>
<p>Evening Market Ups and Downs Even More; The afternoon opening price was 66 taels and 3 qian, and then it was sold by Zhifeng, Yong, etc., and then it dropped to 64 taels 2 or 3 qian. Suddenly, Yuan Cheng started to buy, and immediately jumped up 5 taels, to 69 taels 3 or 4 qian. Yu Da, Fuchang, etc., sold, and it saw setbacks again. At about 2:30, it finally dropped to 62 taels 6 qian. However, the public's confidence was floating and unsettled, and the price was also weakening. HSBC sold September 7 pence 1875. Later, Youli and Holland sold 7 pence 125. The industry was not idle, and Yuan Cheng, Bingxing, etc., scrambled to buy, adding 5 taels again. At 2:45, it was 67 taels 4 or 5 qian, and it retreated slightly to more than 4 taels. After 3 o'clock, the market's buying sentiment was surging, and the bars were extremely scarce, with very little supply. The public's confidence turned strong, and even jumped out of the 70 tael mark. At 4 o'clock, it reached 72 taels and 5 qian. However, the bulls took the opportunity to sell, and it was suppressed by as many as five or six taels. At the close of the market at 4:30, it was 566 taels and 8 qian, compared to the previous day, it rose by 13 taels and 2 qian, and the future may improve. It was found that the maximum price in one day was 72 taels and 5 qian, and the minimum price was 49 taels and 5 qian, a difference of more than 23 taels. The announced price was calculated from 612 taels to 60 taels, and the account was 76 taels to 65 taels. The water replenishment was 76 taels to 78 taels. The early market price was 55 taels and 6 qian, the noon close was 66 taels, the afternoon was 6 taels and 7 qian, and the closing price was 66 taels.</p>
<p>The Transactions Were Very Chaotic; The transactions of each firm were Zhifengyong, Dade, Cheng Hengxing, Yuda, Yuan Xingyong, Yongfeng and other major firms entered and exited without a fixed pattern. Wanxing and Shunli sold more and bought less. Yuanmaoyong and Yiyu all entered. Fuchang and Chunyuanyong all sold. In the afternoon, Yuancheng, Bingxing, Yuan Chengyong, Yuan Xingyong, etc., all entered. Zhifengyong, Tongtaichang, Fuchang, and Yongfeng sold. Wanxing, Shunli, and Taikangrun sold more and bought less. The Dalian gang sold more than 2,000 bars and bought more than 1,000 bars. The Guangdong gang bought more than they sold, about 2,000 bars.</p>

<p>Yesterday's bond market saw continued spot trading and active futures trading.

<p>Overseas cotton yarn market conditions uniformly trended upward, but local sentiment remained weak, with most holding a bearish outlook. Due to sluggish actual demand, sellers continued to exert pressure, and market sentiment remained soft. However, one manufacturer adopted a rather firm stance, showing no intention of easing up. Therefore, the overall situation remains in a state of consolidation.</p>
<p>Auction Gains, Retail Investors Cover Shorts: In the morning auction market, the opening price rose four qian following the firmness of overseas cotton prices, but later fell due to seller pressure. The final result was a rise of one, two, or three qian. In the afternoon, the price of third-grade yarn was firm, and retail investors covered their shorts, leading to a rise of one, two, or three qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 14,050 bales. Of these, Yiyu bought 950 bales, Shenchang 750 bales, Gongtai 800 bales, Yudda 400 bales, and Heshen, Xiesheng, Yidda, Senkang, Tianlong, Daji, Changji, Maoji, Yunde, Taichang, and Yongchang bought between 300 and 500 bales. Hanfeng sold 1,350 bales, Yiyu 750 bales, QinFeng 350 bales, and Tiancheng, Shenxin, Taisheng, Kangrong, Xingchang, Dchang, Chengyuan, Tailichang, Dafeng, Yichang, and Tianchang sold between 300 and 400 bales. The closing prices of the auction market are recorded below:</p>

<p>The cotton market is slightly firmer, mainly due to the stabilization of U.S. cotton trends, leading to a decrease in sellers. Therefore, market sentiment is calm. However, the overall situation remains soft, as new cotton production is good, and supplies from various regions are increasing daily. Major players still have no intention of resisting short positions. However, if overseas cotton rebounds and does not fall again, local cotton may experience a small upward trend.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Hankou Cotton Market Slightly More Stable <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The Hankou cotton market opened firmer in the morning, as the price of award cotton rose again, and sellers were scarce. Market sentiment was tighter, with prices rising by one to two and a half qian for each month. However, the current month fell by one and a half qian due to a lack of receivers. In the afternoon, market sentiment remained firm, with the current month falling another two and a half qian, and longer-term months rising by 0.05 to 0.1 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 74,600 dan. Ruida bought 6,500 dan, QinFeng 2,500 dan, Jifeng 3,200 dan, Tongxing 2,000 dan, Huocheng 1,900 dan, and Yuda, Maoji, Gongtai, Dafeng, Yuande, Taichang, Xiesheng, Yukang, Tianlong, and Gengfeng bought between 1,900 and 2,000 dan.

<p>From January to the end of July, Shanghai imported a total of 171,255 bales of U.S. cotton. From November of last year to the end of July of this year, 467,037 bales of Indian cotton were imported. Both figures represent an increase compared to the same period last year.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Grain: Rice Market Plummets <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, arrivals from various regions were around the 20th of the month, and market sales felt even more sluggish. The decline in prices for Northern "po jing" rice was rampant and had no basis. Top-grade "jing" rice was only between 20.02 and 20.03 yuan, while ordinary "jing" rice barely opened at 19.50 yuan. High-grade "jing" rice fell by about 0.03 yuan, while medium and lower grades had to be reduced by more than 0.5 yuan. At the same time, prices for rice from inland areas uniformly reported declines, making it even more difficult for the local "jing" rice market to stand firm. Due to concerns about continuous sharp declines, buyers and sellers of Dongxin new "jing" rice turned to a wait-and-see attitude, so the decline stabilized slightly, opening at 17.50 yuan, similar to the previous price. Thin rice followed the "jing" rice market and went downstream, with large-scale prices hovering around 20 yuan. New, sharp rice saw an even sharper decline, with high-quality goods being inquired about by retailers at 13.65 yuan, while medium-quality goods were only at 12.80 or 12.90 yuan, a large drop of 0.05 to 0.06 yuan compared to the previous day. Tongbian rice also declined by 0.02 yuan, opening at 18.40 yuan.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: There were few arrivals from the river areas, and sales were also extremely sluggish. Top-grade Changxi "po jing" rice was still being inquired about, but buyers had to significantly reduce their bids, so transactions were unsuccessful. Su and Tong "po jing" rice lacked interest from both urban and rural areas, so the market tended to be quiet. Prices were weak, down by 0.02 or 0.03 yuan, and the situation remained weak. New "jing" rice arrivals were slightly scarce, with prices at 17.50 to 17.00 yuan. The market situation remained soft. The South Shanghai thin "po" market was dull, and prices followed the Northern "jing" rice market and became scarce. New Sanjian rice lacked buying interest, down by a small 0.02 yuan, barely opening at 13.70 or 13.80 yuan. Baiyuan rice was scarce in this area and lacked demand, with an overall weak trend.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Wuxi New "Jing" Rice Has Been on the Market for Three Days <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<h3 id="e197">Initially Opened at 17.70 Yuan...Yesterday Fell to 14.70 Yuan <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The Wuxi market turned sharply downward in the past two days. Since the arrival of new "jing" rice, the daily arrivals have been abundant, and the Shanghai market has frequently declined, greatly weakening confidence. New "jing" rice initially opened at 17.70 yuan, but yesterday's market fell to 14.70 yuan, a huge drop of 3 yuan. The official price was only around 19 yuan. Therefore, most buyers and sellers holding "po jing" rice stored in various warehouses were eager to sell, so the "po jing" market also declined by as much as 1.5 yuan in two days. This is a reaction after a large increase.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Marked Flour Short Covering Leads to Further Price Increases <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw prices rise across all months after the market opened, especially for the current month, as major bulls absorbed shorts, leading to an even more dramatic price increase. The opening price was 2.585 taels, a sharp increase of 0.01 tael compared to the previous close. Prices for other months increased by several li. The current month's delivery is imminent at the end of the month, and major factories have indicated that they will not release warehouse receipts. Small and medium-sized factories have limited strength and do not have many flour reserves, so they will likely not deliver many warehouse receipts. Therefore, the buying atmosphere is even more intense, with a determination to squeeze shorts. The afternoon market saw prices rise again, and floating shorts quickly rushed to cover. Major shorts were also unable to hold on. If no factory releases flour tomorrow or the day after, prices will likely be squeezed even higher. The closing price for the current month increased by another 0.0175 tael, September increased by 0.01 tael, October and November increased by 0.0075 tael, while December and January saw no change.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Wheat Futures Bulls Gain Momentum <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>After yesterday's wheat market opened, large shorts delivered a large batch of goods, stabilizing sentiment. Small longs sold out as the market went, and the market reversed to weaken. However, the current wheat reserves are mostly of medium quality, which do not meet the standards. The bullish momentum is even stronger, with both recent and distant deliveries being bought up. The afternoon opening saw more improvement, and the closing price for the current month increased by another 0.03 tael, September and November increased by 0.03 tael each, October increased by 0.04 tael, and December and January increased by 0.02 tael each. Spot wheat arrivals and reserves were both low, and factory demand was strong. A total of 5,000 bags of wheat from various regions were offered, and prices rose by another 0.05 to 0.06 tael.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market: communications from the producing areas showed that the current price of Cuban sugar was 1.125, a decrease of 0.3125 compared to the previous telegram. New York sugar futures prices were 1.06 for September, 1.17 for December, 1.29 for March of next year, and 1.37 for May. Compared to the previous day, only September and March decreased, while the rest remained unchanged. The current price of Java sugar was 8.875, with futures prices at 8.625 for September and 8.5625 for October, also lacking any increases or decreases. In the Association market, there was little interest in buying No. 24 Dutch coarse granulated white sugar, with an asking price of 7 taels and 9 qian, and few buyers. High-quality goods sold slightly at 7 taels, 9 qian, and 2.5 fen. The market was not unusual. Fine granulated white sugar at 8 taels was still popular. No. 9 Dutch red sugar was 6 taels and 6.5 qian, with slow transactions. The Japanese sugar market was more active, and prices rose slightly. N-mark sugar was 7 taels, 9 qian, 2.5 fen to 7 taels and 9.5 qian, very firm. J-mark sugar was 8 taels, 1 qian, and 2.5 fen, also very firm. YRO-mark Meiji goods were 7 taels and 7 qian, Minghua goods were 7 taels and 7.5 qian, and YT-mark sugar was 7 taels, 8 qian, and 2.5 fen. The market was also not unusual. In the spot market, Huaxin Foreign Company offered over 2,000 packages of No. 10 Dutch red sugar at 6.70 yuan and 6.75 yuan, and also sold thousands of bags of No. 9 goods at 6.65 yuan, all inclusive of new regulations and taxes, which was still stable. The market situation seemed to be declining compared to the previous day.</p>

In addition, suppliers have also reported tight prices, with no easing. The trend is even better. Yesterday, 60 packages were offered at 19 taels and 7 qian. The official market price also shouted higher, with hopes of selling at 20 taels, but sellers are still watching.</p>
<p>New Black Melon Seeds: Since the price decline, sales have been good, and the market has slightly recovered. Yesterday, over 300 packages of Xukui seeds were offered at 10 taels and 4 qian, and 70 packages of Dangshan seeds were offered at 11 taels.</p>

<p>New York Market: Recently, all silk factories have suffered from insufficient capital, and silk fabric sales have been sluggish. Demand for raw silk has greatly decreased. On Monday, sales at Chinese silk factories were stagnant, silk prices continued to fall by over 0.1 yuan, and there were still no inquiries. Grade A Shanghai factory silk was offered at US$3.65, and Grade B was offered at US$3.05. Both grades had prices but no market. The local foreign silk market remained quiet. Overseas raw silk sales have been decreasing daily. Although Chinese silk prices have been reduced, there have been no telegrams for transactions. The market atmosphere was quiet. Yesterday, only Kechang imported 20 bales of Mianyang yellow silk at a price of 445 taels.</p>

<p>The white lead sheet market has been sluggish for a long time, and the standard price has remained unchanged for a long time. Recently, Tianjin merchants have shown signs of movement, and the military procurement office has suddenly started purchasing in large quantities. Therefore, the volume of transactions is almost comparable to the best-selling items among major hardware products. According to inquiries, over the past two days, a total of 140 barrels have been purchased. The price of No. 2 is estimated at 25 taels per dan, No. 3 and No. 4 are both offered at 24 taels, No. 5 is 22 taels and 7.5 qian, No. 6 is 22 taels and 2.5 qian, No. 7 is 21 taels and 7.5 qian, No. 8 is 22 taels, No. 9 is 22 taels and 2.5 qian, No. 10 is 21 taels, and No. 12 and the thickest varieties are priced at 20 taels per dan.

<p>The Five Star Film Company announces that the company has been in preparation for two months. Most of the founders have left for other matters. Now, many people well-known in the film industry have joined, and the first drama will soon be officially filmed. The script is currently under discussion, and the selection of talent for the roles in the drama will be especially cautious. At the latest, filming will begin in the first ten days of next month.</p>
<p>Paramount Company on Museum Road announces that the details of the return to the United States of American Rear Admiral Byrd and his Antarctic expedition team have been published in the pictorial weekly of the previous issue of Shenbao. The success of this Antarctic expedition can be said to be a great contribution to science. Although human efforts are resolute and enduring, without the aid of scientific tools, fate will prevail over man, and the lives of Antarctic explorers will be lost. When the expedition team set off, the American Paramount Film Company specially commissioned two photographers to go to Antarctica to film on location. The achievements of these two photographers are no less than those of the explorers, because although the world can hear about the expedition, the organization of the team, the preparation for departure, the experiences of the expedition, and most importantly, the true scenery of Antarctic geography, will be passed on to future generations through moving pictures. As the saying goes, "Seeing is believing." Even if we have seen photos of the expedition in Chinese and foreign newspapers and magazines, photos are not as clear and accurate as moving pictures. Therefore, the importance of the Antarctic expedition film is evident. This film has already been shown in major cities in the United States. It took two years to film, using 150,000 feet of film, which was edited down to 8,000 feet. It is a complete record of the essence of this expedition. The premiere started in New York on August 25, 1929. There were two cargo ships at the time of departure, one large and one small. The large one was dedicated to carrying food, exploration equipment, and explorers. The small one followed behind the cargo ship, intended as a lifeboat. The two ships left New Zealand on December 2 and headed for Antarctica. On December 25, they arrived at the Ross Ice Shelf. On the 28th, they established a camp in Whale Bay, named Little America, as the base for the expedition. This was close to the base established by explorer Amundsen in 1912. Byrd's expedition was equipped with all the modern scientific aids needed for exploration, such as wireless telephones and airplanes. These two were the most important items for explorers in recent years. Therefore, three wireless telephone stations and an airfield were built on the ice floe in Little America. The explorers lived entirely in ice and snow. The geology of the Antarctic continent is made of ice, more than two thousand feet thick, below which is the sea. The coldness of such ice and snow can be imagined. After the explorers arrived at the Ross Ice Shelf, they moved the food from the cargo ship to the camp, and then the cargo ship left the Ross Ice Shelf and sailed outside the ice floe, to the Antarctic Ocean, to avoid being surrounded by hard ice in winter and unable to sail back to shore. The explorer's residence was dug deep in the snow, and the walls were tightly covered with thick cloth. The main camp was divided into two, with a tunnel 600 feet long in the middle. Food boxes were piled on both sides of the tunnel. At this time, the Antarctic weather was in summer, with sunlight for 24 hours a day, but the cold was still below 20 degrees below freezing. On January 27, 1929, Rear Admiral Byrd took a large airplane for the first time to observe various places. To the southeast of Little America, he discovered a mountain range and named it the Rockefeller Mountains, to commemorate the oil king Rockefeller, as Rockefeller was one of the enthusiastic donors to this expedition. After April, the winter climate of Antarctica gradually approached, and it was dark for 24 hours a day. The explorers prepared to enjoy the life of this harsh winter. The wireless telephone station built in the base often communicated with the New York radio station. This Little America, separated by more than two thousand miles from human civilization, relied entirely on wireless telephones to avoid becoming a stateless land. The winter in Antarctica is the hottest summer in New York. The temperature in New York is 96 degrees, while in Antarctica it is 72 degrees below freezing. The difference is 168 degrees, so the southernmost part of the earth is the coldest place. After this six-month-long night, on November 28, a mild spring returned. The expedition team prepared a plan to fly over Antarctica, wiping and oiling the large airplane. Recently, a second airfield was established in Antarctica, in case the airplane had to land while passing over Antarctica, then there must be an airfield for the airplane to land. The precision of the preparation is admirable. On the 29th, Rear Admiral Byrd and his large airplane flew around Antarctica, and placed an American flag from the airplane. At this time, Rear Admiral Byrd used the wireless telephone installed in the large airplane to broadcast the news of flying over Antarctica. In an instant, all countries in the world celebrated this unprecedented great Antarctic expedition. As for the actual situation and scenery of the expedition, when this film arrives in Shanghai, it will naturally open our eyes, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Italian Poetry <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Kang</p>
<p>Italian literature in recent years has made more significant leaps than before, because after several years of political calm, the national vitality has recovered, and writers have been able to work in peace. Although their literary works, apart from D'Annunzio and Pirandello, have received little attention, the rise of young writers has greatly increased recently.</p>
<p>In Italian literature, poetry is the most representative of the Italian spirit. Since the Dawn Movement of 1915, poets have worked hard to create following the D'Annunzranism of the patriotic poet D'Annunzio, and have achieved great results. However, after the European War, the inspiration that poets gained from abroad decreased, and the production volume greatly decreased. Recently, there has been a new need for poetry in Italy. A young Milanese editor has begun printing "Collection of Italian Poetry."</p>
<p>The first volume, belonging to Aldo Palazzeschi's poems, has been published. Although he is not a new poet, among the poets who rose after D'Annunzio, he is considered the one who can best maintain the inherent form and style. Because of his friendship with F. T. Marinetti, he was initially a Futurist, but he is actually a writer with a heavy dawn-era mysticism. Reading his time, one can't help but return to the era of twenty years ago, because at that time D'Annunzio was also doing mysterious dreams, so writers of the same era fell into the atmosphere of D'Annunzranism. However, the era of mysticism has passed, and the environment does not allow them to have such dreams. Therefore, during the European War, D'Annunzio abandoned the mysterious life of a poet and went to the front line to fight for the motherland, which completely divided him into two people before and after the war, and also opened up a new era in his life. The second volume, Riccardo Bacchelli, also does not have a new atmosphere. The literary taste is extremely strong, and it is only worth praising for the beautiful impressions and descriptions. The depth of thought is worth leaving a deep impression.</p>
<p>The Italian government, in order to encourage new poets, had previously offered a reward for soliciting a biography of the patriotic poet D'Annunzio. Now, it is vigorously rejecting the mysticism in the literary movement of the dawn period, because mysticism is not suitable for the needs of the new era, and the entire Italian nation no longer needs poets who create art for art's sake. Therefore, the government is trying its best to uplift the Futurists, and trying to use their heroic and vigorous temperament in politics. At the same time, when writers across the country feel that there is no possibility of new literature being produced in Italy, they also agree with the government's efforts. Perhaps the new literature of Italy will be produced in their cooperative cooperation.</p>

<h3 id="e235">D'Annunzio <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Kang</p>
<p>Among the existing writers in Italy, the one with the most world renown and the highest status in the country is D'Annunzio, famous for his novels, dramas, poems, and songs. Because he is not only a writer who brags on paper and in his mouth, but he is a practitioner who can actually work for his ideals and sacrifice for his motherland.</p>
<p>During the European War, in addition to the extreme anti-war stance of young literary figures, the old writers in Germany and the Allied countries狂熱were singing enthusiastically for fighting for the motherland and fighting for freedom. However, among the German poet Arno Holz, the playwright Hauptmann, the Belgian poet Verhaeren, the poet Enrle Cammaerts, who wrote "Patriotic Songs," as well as the English Kipling, Shaw, and the French Maurice Barries and Andre Suaies, D'Annunzio can also be considered a writer who practices what he preaches. He abandoned his creative work and joined the air force to engage in aerial warfare, and even flew his plane to the Austrian positions, dropping letters urging the people in Vienna to reflect. After the war, he donated his residence to the motherland as a souvenir of victory. Therefore, in the eyes of the government, D'Annunzio's position is above everyone else.</p>
<p>Among all his works, the most influential to Italian writers is his poetry. His poetry is gorgeous in diction and harmonious in style. After the publication of his poetry collection "Lotus Eaters," he not only became the head of Italian poets, but also immediately became the head of the European literary world. In the so-called Italian dawn period movement, during the years from 1910 to 1915, a group of poets followed D'Annunzio.</p>
<p>In the past few years, due to political instability, there has been no progress in the creation of poetry. Now, because the political situation is stable, and young people also believe that poetry is the only tool to sing and fill Italy, a Milanese editor has begun printing "Collection of Italian Poetry." The viewpoint of collection is not entirely artistic appreciation, but focuses on works that can promote the glory of the Italian nation. In the entire selection, decadent and old-fashioned writers are discarded, and the purpose is to inspire writers and works in Italy that can excite the new era.</p>
<p>Although D'Annunzio is now an established writer, he is extremely supportive of the new Italian youth who come later.</p>

<p>Worth 30 Million Yuan Daily Japanese Iwamoto Wants to Make a Fortune</p>
<p>Tokyo News: Japanese Iwamoto, 67 years old, will depart for eastern Siberia at the end of this month to search for gold, jewelry, etc., worth 30 million daily yen, hidden by former Russian Emperor Nicholas. According to Iwamoto, this treasure was buried by the emperor's adjutant a few weeks before Nicholas was killed in 1917. It was originally worth 100 million daily yen, but part of it was taken away by General Kolchak's subordinates. Iwamoto first heard about this matter from a Korean in January 1928. The Korean heard it from a Russian-Japanese soldier. Iwamoto then told important figures such as the late Okura man, but they did not believe it at first. Iwamoto then went to Korea in May of that year to investigate in detail and learned that it was true. However, entering Russian territory to excavate the treasure would definitely be shot by the Russian authorities, so it has been delayed until now. Now Iwamoto knows the exact location of the burial, and has recently sent personnel to the Russian border. He is also determined to go and work together to find a way to excavate it.</p>
<h3 id="e238">The Danger of the Leaning Tower of Pisa <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>The Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy is one of the wonders of the world, and is also famous in the history of science, because in the sixteenth century, the scientist Galileo once conducted experiments on it to prove that objects fall from a height at the same speed. Over the years, tourists have flocked to Pisa, and all have marveled at the wonder. But now news has come that the tower is almost in danger.</p>
<p>According to the investigation by the committee of the government in charge of the tower, from 1919 to 1929, the tower's tilt increased by ten millimeters, that is, it must tilt more than one-third of an inch per year. The tower is 180 inches high, and it was already tilted 16 feet when it was completed. If it tilts one foot more, the center point cannot be maintained, and it will collapse like the Leifeng Pagoda in our country. According to the current situation, the tower will not be able to be maintained within three hundred years. What is even more feared is that the increase in tilt will be in geometric progression, not arithmetic progression. If so, the life of the tower will be even shorter. Therefore, those in charge are making every effort to preserve this unique wonder for the world.</p>
<p>After careful investigation by scientists, the reason for the increase in the tower's tilt is mostly due to the ground's inability to support it. According to the calculation of the tower's weight, each square centimeter must bear 10 kilograms of weight, but in recent years, due to the increase in houses next to the tower, it has increased to 11 kilograms, resulting in an inability to support it and gradually sinking. Recently, the four sides of the tower have almost become ditches, and children can float toys in them. The only way to save it at present is to glue the soil next to and under the tower with cement, which may help in case of emergency. This plan has been tested, and the results are very satisfactory. Once the funds are available, construction will probably begin. (Junshan)</p>

<h3 id="e239">Collection of Folk Rhymes and Proverbs of Wujin <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Zeng Yang</p>
<p>Compiled by Wu Shouzhen</p>
<p>To truly concentrate on studying folk art, one must of course quietly find many ways that can evoke the purpose of exploration. For example, when we study "children's rhymes" or "folk songs," it is advisable to collect "children's rhymes" or "folk songs" from various places, gather them together, and conduct a systematic comparative study. We can see what the lives of women in a certain place are like, and we can also see what the customs and customs of a certain place are like. When we discover absolute differences or sudden similarities, we can unconsciously evoke various strong interests. Then, for the study of this literature, we can also obtain the most beautiful and full harvest. This is inevitable. No matter what kind of literature you study, if you work hard in a stereotyped and stagnant way, you will never be able to achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<p>I recently discovered this "Collection of Folk Rhymes and Proverbs of Wujin," which really aroused my unusual joy, because after reading so many so-called folk "songs" and "stories," now reading this thin "proverb," although it only has thirty-odd proverbs, I deeply feel that it has a unique flavor. It's like we eat too many delicious cocoa mandarins, and put an olive with astringency in our mouths to chew it, which is even more refreshing. This is really human nature. I had such a feeling when I read this collection of "rhymes and proverbs."</p>
<p>"Rhymes and proverbs" actually occupy an important position in folk literature. This "rhymes and proverbs" comes from the mouths of the people, and is more meaningful than those created by literati and scholars, because it is completely the expression of true feelings and the manifestation of nakedness. The meanings contained in them are mostly derived from experience, as described in this preface:</p>
<p>"Rhymes and proverbs are not only a very precious folk literature, but also the sound of a social mind of an era or a place. In other words, what rhymes and proverbs contain is not only artistic elements, but also religion, science, morality, habits, education, etc., can be found everywhere, because its creation is not by a poet singing in the deep mountains and valleys, or related to the door, but is accumulated with the experience and human feelings of the public, that is, what individuals want to sing in their hearts and tongues.</p>
<p>The above passage really describes the formation and value of "rhymes and proverbs" extremely thoroughly and precisely. It cannot be denied that "rhymes and proverbs" contain profound implications and upward words. When we open this "Collection of Folk Rhymes and Proverbs of Wujin" compiled by Mr. Wu and read it, we can deeply believe it. It turns out that proverbs are the crystallization of human experience. It is "not baptized by science, so it cannot be regarded as scientific principles, but part of human experience, often because there is no opportunity to organize into science, so it is preserved by relying on proverbs alone. Although proverbs are not as good as science, they are also a valuable part of human experience." Because of this, collecting proverbs is as important as collecting folk songs.</p>
<p>Here, it is divided into two collections. The first collection is "Songs," with a total of 30-odd songs. The second collection is proverbs, with three types: one about the state of the world and human feelings, two about celestial phenomena, and three about climate. Each one is also divided into many small categories, so that we can know at a glance what the proverb refers to. It can be seen that the compiler has put a lot of effort into it.</p>
<p>Sitting and eating will empty the mountains,</p>
<p>If you don't grind, you won't be able to become an adult,</p>
<p>Hair is tied out, strength is squeezed out,</p>
<p>There are only lazy people, no lazy land,</p>
<p>Pigs sleep to grow meat, people sleep to tear down houses,</p>
<p>A dull knife is sharpened on a stone, a dull person is sharpened in the world,</p>
<p>Eat all the bitterness, to be a superior person,</p>
<p>Save on eating, save on using, save on asking for help, three years of rotten rice to buy a cow,</p>
<p>If you cherish food, you will have food to eat, if you cherish clothes, you will have clothes to wear,</p>
<p>Wearing clothes depends on your family, eating depends on where you come from,</p>
<p>It is better to buy expensive things to use, than to buy cheap things to eat,</p>
<p>Eating is not poor, wearing is not poor, if you don't calculate, you will be poor for a lifetime,</p>
<p>In each of these words and sentences, there are thorns piercing our entire hearts, promoting the diligence, thrift, and upward development of a national character with a simple style. Such maxims of warning the world are really impossible to find in books. Even if you can find them, they are not so fluent in words and sentences, and you can sing them naturally, arousing endless interest. Here, is the determination of the value of folk literature. When we read this collection of "proverbs," it is obviously different from when we praise "folk songs." Many of them can indeed be used as models for the words and deeds of today's people. Its content is based on direct experience, so it has been left to modern times, and can still affect the current society. For this reason, I will quote another one below,</p>
<p>People fight for a breath, people are old but their hearts are not old,</p>
<p>Rather die than surrender,</p>
<p>Strong grandfather and grandmother, better than ancestors,</p>
<p>Poor but not discouraged, rich but not crazy,</p>
<p>Bricks and tiles also have a chance to turn over,</p>
<p>Rather starve to death, than be a thief,</p>
<p>If you have ambition, don't be afraid of old age, if you have no ambition, you will grow a hundred years in vain,</p>
<p>Don't count the road when you go out,</p>
<p>People look high, water looks low,</p>
<p>Good horses don't eat the grass they turn back to,</p>
<p>Rabbits don't eat the grass near their home,</p>
<p>This proverb says that a person must have a heroic ambition, strive to create oneself, and have an upward and enterprising mind, running on the right track of all mankind, and there will be unlimited hope in the future. These are all encouraging maxims. We must not ignore them and read them unconsciously.</p>
<p>This collection of "Folk Rhymes and Proverbs of Wujin" is also suitable as a teaching material for primary schools, because it is all the promotion of the experience of the predecessors, and can be used as a reference for primary school teachers who teach Chinese. With this teaching method to guide children, I believe that we will definitely receive benefits beyond people's expectations. Many of the "songs" collected here are heroic and upward, and are rarely seen beautiful songs. Then, this is a good children's book. I hope that enthusiastic primary school teachers will pay attention to it.</p>

<h3 id="e243">Mechanized Parking Garage <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Ping Bao Yuan</p>
<p>Can Solve Shanghai's Traffic Management Problems</p>
<p>The problem of traffic management is one of the important and difficult issues that modern cities pay attention to. Take Shanghai as an example, the streets are narrow and the number of vehicles is increasing every day. Therefore, those in charge of municipal administration attach great importance to this matter. As for the biggest reason for the accumulation of traffic, it is the parking of cars. Residents are also gradually realizing that they should no longer adopt the policy of parking cars freely anywhere. It is imperative to adopt other ingenious methods of parking.</p>
<p>Therefore, how to solve this major and difficult problem is extremely important. Looking at the city of New York, it has now used scientific methods. The Gander Auto Parking Company, the initiator of the Gander mechanical car advancing method, is currently building a Gander auto parking facility that can accommodate 1,000 cars.</p>
<p>At the Gander Mechanized Parking Garage, you can get a receipt for your car on the lowest floor. The ground floor is exclusively for the needs of the cashier. The area it occupies is wide and has a very high ceiling, without columns to hinder the convenience of entry and exit. When you drive to the elevator door, you can lock the car and get out. Then a manager will send you a retrieval check. When you need the car, just move to the cashier's office and present the check. At the same time, the telegraph machine notifies the elevator operator with a mark. The car will be delivered to the lowest floor within two minutes.</p>
<p>At the Gander Auto Parking Garage, purely with Gander electric parking equipment, combining rapid self-leveling elevators, everything is managed. The so-called electric parking equipment is a standard measure of lightweight rubber towing wheels. When in use, it is placed under the car and the gears are connected to the rubber interconnection. Using four-sided levers, it can be moved forward, backward, up, and down at will. Therefore, the manager does not need to leave his original position at the foot of the elevator and can receive, park, and deliver all vehicles.</p>
<p>Features and Advantages of Auto Parking</p>
<p>(1) Saves Time. The entry and exit of vehicles is more convenient than previous methods. Customers can pick up and drop off their cars on the lowest floor. All cars in the garage are placed by electric parking equipment.</p>
<p>(2) Saves Land. The same size area can store more cars with this method. Tall buildings can accommodate many cars. It is also suitable for smaller and more expensive land. This is very convenient for commercial theaters, hotels, and other areas.</p>
<p>(3) Prevents Damage - "At the Gander Mechanized Parking Garage, no hand will touch your car." Electric parking equipment manages vehicles and also avoids the drawbacks of stains and grease. The speeding of locomotives, excessive use of automatic machines and batteries, and misuse of wheels and brakes, etc., can all be eliminated. Vehicles are parked in steel rooms and drive straight - without curves or minor injuries.</p>
<p>(4) Prevents Theft. Whether it is the customer, the original owner, or the driver, no one is allowed to step into the storage area. Car doors and machine doors can also be locked at will.</p>
<p>(5) Lower Pricing. (A) Lower for commercial use because this type of auto parking garage requires skilled and experienced employees, so fewer people are used. (B) Based on storage location, the capital cost is also cheaper. Mechanized parking garages can instantly park vehicles in tall buildings. Therefore, even in expensive areas, the rent for car parking spaces must not be high.</p>

<h3 id="e245">Nash Car Wins Championship in French Competition <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Gan</p>
<p>Nash cars participated in the annual French car competition this time. “Your de France” won two championships. One is a gold badge, awarding its perfect and reliable driving. More than 150 people participated in the competition. The other is the famous George Ham Cup, won for high-speed driving on Mount Reims. Both winning cars were Nash 400s, overwhelming the crowd. It is not easy to win this grand prize in an international auto competition.</p>
<p>Two people from Nash participated in the competition. One was Mr. Rowan driving a double-ignition six-cylinder car, and the other was Mr. Dume driving a double-ignition eight-cylinder car. Mr. Dume had won the French road championship. The route taken by the competitors was extremely difficult, but the success of the two Nash cars has its own advantages.</p>
<p>The annual "Tour de France" is the most interesting and moving of the world's auto competitions. In the eyes of European car drivers, this kind of competition combines romantic and mechanical competitions, quite reminiscent of the old Gelatin travels. The public has a national auto exhibition. The old Pike's Peak auto climb and the annual Indianapolis Speedway competition are speed time trials on the Reims Speedway. The double-ignition eight-cylinder car driven by Dume averaged 100 kilometers per hour. The car that won this year's George Ham Cup reached 138 kilometers per hour. Nash cars are easy to drive and move beautifully, and are very safe at high speeds. All these advantages are related to the competition.</p>
<p>The interest of the competition is that all those who participate in the above-mentioned competitions participate in this meeting, and experts judge the pros and cons of various cars. This year's competition started from the Podo Meru in Paris. The entire course has 500 kilometers of rugged roads, totaling eight days of travel. The first encounters are the two places of Điện Harvey and Lire. This competition also includes mountain climbing, which takes place in the mountains of southern France. There are also cold Matto braking and other competitions. The race in Reims is only about speed.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, each station managing the competition has a commissioner in charge. Every morning and evening, they inspect the condition of the cars participating in the competition and evaluate the performance of the cars along the way. Even the smallest shortcomings, such as engine overheating when climbing mountains, malfunctioning pistons, slow turns, and unstable driving, are not ignored by experts. All kinds of shortcomings that drivers inevitably have are subject to strict criticism.</p>
<p>Wherever the car passes, it is parked and exhibited at the management site for the observation of local car drivers. This auto travel competition is called the "Spring Auto Travel Exhibition." Every day, tens of millions of enthusiastic auto competition enthusiasts watch and judge its merits along the way. The auto exhibition held in the Grand Palace of Paris is even more lively. Nash cars have gained special records due to various excellences. They have made many new friends in France. Many specially appointed distributors in the cities and towns that the competition team passed through are also a clear proof of Nash's popularity.</p>
<p>Mr. Rowan, who drove the Nash car in the competition, his double-ignition six-cylinder car was newly shipped from the factory. The double-ignition eight-cylinder car that won the new record was taken from the showroom. The car body and mechanical parts of both cars are standard equipment.</p>
<p>Newspaper experts participating in this travel competition said, "During the difficult journey, the Nash car did not encounter any accidents. The smooth performance is commendable. In Bristol, during the cold Matto development, a Nash car traveled 10 kilometers in five seconds, and it was after a cold rainy night. As for the convenience of driving and the comfort of the springs, Nash is worthy of being the ideal travel car."</p>

<p>— Wu Fei</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province (1) Since the recruitment of workers to build roads began last December, more than 20 counties have started construction. The working conditions of each road, such as the Yichang Provincial Road in Changshu County, the Changshu section of the Xichang Line, the northern section of the Xicheng Highway in Jiangyin County, and the Wudan Road between Danyang and Wujin, have all completed the earthwork construction of the entire road. The Yixing section of the Xiyi Line in Yixing County has completed about ten miles of earthwork. The Yichang Provincial Road in Wuxi County and the Wuxi section of the Xichang Line, although the starting date was set, the work was not actually implemented. The Yangxu Provincial Road in Jiangdu, Huai'an, Huaiyin, and Tongshan, and the Liuhai Provincial Road between Haimen, Nantong, and Liuhe counties have all been completed in part. Due to the unfinished agricultural work, all the counties that recruited workers have temporarily suspended work. It is expected that after the autumn harvest, they will need to continue to complete the work. (2) The Zhenjiang Jiangbian Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is too far from the tide, which is quite inconvenient for loading and unloading goods. It is now planned to add a branch road from the South Station to Ganlu Temple to facilitate the transportation of goods between the north and south of the Yangtze River. The construction cost is estimated to be 450,000 yuan, which will be borrowed by the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce and repaid by the Railway Bureau. The Railway Bureau has ordered the Engineering Department to formulate detailed plans and conduct surveys. (3) The Jingwu Highway starts from Andermen in southern Beijing, passes through Jiangning Town, enters Anhui Province, and reaches Wuhu, with a total distance of more than 70 miles. The survey is currently underway, and the construction of the roadbed is being promoted simultaneously. The earthwork project of the first section past Jiangning Town has also started last month. (4) The road from Nanjing to Molingguan is currently being surveyed. Construction will begin as soon as the survey is completed. (5) The stone road surface of the Jinghang Road Jingju section has been completed. There are many cars coming and going. In order to maintain the road surface and manage traffic, a road maintenance office has been set up to take charge of the matter.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province (1) The Hangzhou-Changxing and Hangzhou-Changhua roads actively built by the Zhejiang Highway Bureau. The roadbed project of the Hangzhou-Changhua road has been completed from Hualong to Yuqian. The mountain opening project will be completed. From Yuqian to Changhua, the earthwork has been completed by 80,000 cubic feet. The water pipe project from Yuqian to Hualongdong can be completed this month. The bridge project has also been completed by 50-60%. The survey between Changhua Yulingguan was also completed last month. Only the road funds are insufficient, and construction has not yet started. The Hangzhou-Changxing road line has been completed, and only the two stations of Shijiaqiao and Yangjiabu have not been completed. (2) The Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau is strictly levying the highway, which has a great relationship with Zhejiang's transportation. Engineer Yu Zhewen led a team to survey and determine the route. The route from Yanzhou to Huizhou passes through Fuyang, Xindeng, Fenshui, Jiande, and Chun'an counties. The road is about 300 miles long and more than two-thirds have been built. (3) The Yin-Feng line is planned to start from Yuanzhen Bridge, pass through Qiaoshang Shuichi, Yangjia Wangjia Bridge Dongqiao Tou, and reach Yinjiang Bridge. A station will be added in the middle at Shagang Kou Gongjia. The estimated route length is about 16 miles, and the construction cost is estimated at 50,000 yuan. The local gentry of Yinjiang Bridge will raise the money first. There is also an original Qixiang Bridge in Shangshui. It is now planned to rebuild the railway, and the cost is about 7,000 taels. The local gentry Zhang Shenzhi and others are responsible for raising funds in Shanghai. (4) Zhejiang Province has stipulated the construction of Xiaochang, Jinyong, and Jinpu three light railways. Xiaochang is the first phase, Jinyong is the second phase, and Jinpu is the third phase, which will be carried out in sequence. As for its starting and ending points, the Xiaochang line starts from the Xixing Jiangbian in Hangzhou, which is transported by water, and passes through Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Yiwu, Jinhua, Lanxi, Tangxi, Longyou, and Qu County to reach Changshan, which is 315 kilometers long. In the future, it is also planned to extend to Yushan, Jiangxi, which will increase by 36 kilometers. The Jinyong line starts from Jinhua and connects to the Xiaochang line, passing through Wuyi, Yongkang, Jinyun, and Yongjia, which is 180 kilometers long. The Jinpu line starts from Jinyun and connects to the Jinyong line, passing through Lishui and Longquan to Pucheng in Fujian, which is 178 kilometers long. The earthwork of the first section of the Xiaochang Road has been completed by more than 160,000 cubic meters. The bridge contracting fee for this section is more than 110,000 yuan. According to the contract, it must be completed within three months. Construction started on the 7th and 8th of last month at Xiaochang Xinzha Bridge, including Daqiao Panjia Bridge and other places. The earthwork of the second section has been completed by 120,000 cubic meters. The bridge must be completed within three months as stipulated.</p>
<h3 id="e247">New Aishan Keshui's New-Style Table Version <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Jiangxi Province The main highways of Jiangxi Province are now divided into five categories: (A) Gan-Yue Line, starting from Nanchang, passing through Fengcheng, Qingjiang, Xingan, Xiajiang, Jishui, Ji'an, Xingyuan, Ganxian, Nankang, Dashou and other counties, with a total length of 1,000 li. (B) Gan-Xiang starts from Xinyun, passing through Nanchang, Gao'an, Shanggao, Wanzai, Ping County and other counties, with a total length of 500 li. (C) Gan-Zhe Line starts from Nanchang, passing through Jinxian, Dongxiang, Yuping, Yujiang, Guixi, Yiyang, Qianshan, Shangrao, Yushan and other counties, with a total length of 500 li. (D) Gan-E Line starts from Nanchang to Anyi, Zhanggongdu, and Baicha, with a total length of 460 li. (E) Gan-Min Line starts from Liangjiadu on the Gan-Zhe Line, passing through Nanchang, Linchuan, Nancheng and other counties, with a total length of 440 li. From this, it can be seen that after the completion of the main highways in Jiangxi Province, the transportation with neighboring provinces will definitely be convenient. In addition, there are two lines from Jingde to Hukou and Jiujiang to Lushan, with a total length of more than 270 li. The total length of the line is more than 3,000 li, and the required funds are about 10 million yuan. It is now being built in three phases. The Gan-Yue, Gan-Zhe, Gan-Xiang, Jing-Hu, and Jiu-Lu lines are the first phase. The Gan-Min and Gan-E lines are the second phase. The construction of permanent bridges in various counties is the third phase. The work is carried out separately. The only ones that have been built are the Nan-Zhang section of the Gan-Yue Line, with a total length of 180 li.</p>

<p>— Xin</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Auto Company operates between Shanghai and the Liuhe Town and Jiading in Taicang County. The business has been increasingly developed in recent days. It is expected that the vehicles are running on time and the scale is neat. Recently, in order to facilitate passengers and recognize the route, the company specially ordered craftsmen to rush to make a large number of road signs (the same as trams). It is installed on the front of the car. The black background and white characters are very clear. It is said that each one costs about eleven or twelve yuan. There are Shanghai, Dachang, Gujia Town, Liuhang, Luodian, Liuhe, Xinjingqiao, Jiading, and other places and fixed car styles. This move is of great benefit to passengers. It can avoid the trouble of searching. Other stations can also be seen from a distance before the car arrives. It has now been installed and is half completed. It is said that it will be completed soon.</p>
<h3 id="e249">News of the Arrival of the Latest Road Building Machine in China <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, transportation undertakings in various places have been developing rapidly, and especially in the southern provinces of the Yangtze River, there are the most builders of new roads. However, they are all due to the huge projects and the lack of good machinery, which leads to prolonged delays and increased costs. The German merchant Lihe Foreign Company in this city, in view of this, will bring the latest trenching and road building machine from overseas to Shanghai. The front of the machine is a silkworm-type car. The front and rear wheels are connected to extremely wide toothed chain. It crawls on the ground, just like a silkworm moving, so it can climb mountains and descend slopes, and it can also walk on loose ground. There is a motor, which is 30 horsepower. Its work is to dig ditches and dig mud on one side, and at the same time use the dug mud to build a fish-back-shaped road. Division of labor and cooperation, it is done in one go. Working 10 to 12 hours a day, it can build 3 miles of road, which is about 9 Chinese miles. The daily consumption cost, such as fuel and machine</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>Oil and all other expenses included, at most, it does not exceed 30 yuan. In this way, a hundred miles project will take no more than ten days. The cost is less than 400 yuan, and it can be completed and opened to traffic. Compared with the current artificial excavation, the time and cost are far from comparable. It is said that Lihe Foreign Company, in order to demonstrate the function of the machine, plans to wait for the machine to arrive in Shanghai and submit a request to the Municipal Works Bureau to allow it to conduct on-site experiments. At that time, the engineer of the company will point out everything. The company especially welcomes people from all walks of life who are concerned about road administration to visit.</p>

<h3 id="e250">Small Experiences in Renting Cars <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Ping Xin</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the traffic is extremely congested. Not to mention that pedestrians are in fear, even those who sit in cars are afraid that the driver will cause trouble in the middle of the road, and they often break out in a cold sweat. When I first arrived in Shanghai, I liked to rent very beautiful cars. The drivers were all energetic, and when they drove, they rammed all the way, showing off their skills. At that time, I seemed to have rushed into the enemy's defense line on the battlefield. It was extremely dangerous. I couldn't wait to jump out of the car immediately and say to the driver, friend, let me down. I can't stand this kind of shock.</p>
<p>Recently, I rented a sedan, it seems to be a Ford. The situation is different. His driver drives very cautiously. I can determine that he has undergone strict training. It is said that there is also a kind of machinery installed on their cars to limit the rate, so that passengers can be more courageous and at ease.</p>
<p>Because of the above-mentioned small experience in renting cars, I feel that the first thing to pay attention to when renting a car is the safety issue. As for the style of the car, the 1930 style is good, and the 1929 style is also good. This brand is good, and that brand is good. It doesn't matter. Because no matter how beautiful the car is, the notice is always white with black characters. Who doesn't know it's a rental car?</p>
