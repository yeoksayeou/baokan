<p>革命風潮旣起之後。勢不得不益取高壓手段。嚴禁集會結社。取銷已恢復之言論自由。於是愈高壓而華命之進行亦愈速。尤可注意者。西班牙之學生。向守沈默。乃此次之革命運動。忽以大學生爲中心。故當局亟亟焉停閉學堂。勒令學生之首領某敎授。回里敎書。以爲從此可以無人煽動。學生之運動。可以消滅。其實學生之醖釀革命已久。當反對里夫拉獨裁力主恢復君憲時代。即有著名文學家伊本湼茲氏。盛倡民主政治説。其種子早已滿布於全國之靑年。今日之學生運動不過收成熟之結果而已。豈停閉一二學校。驅逐一二敎授。所能消滅之哉。總之在此時代。即眞能恢復君憲。實行選舉。已不能消弭今日之華命運動。况乎其僅以復憲爲緩和之一手段。實際仍欲維持其獨裁之權能耶。由斯以言。西班牙之亂事。正未有艾已</p>

<p>▲中央宣傳部、頃發布再告晋冀陜甘豫各省靑年書、原文如下、親愛的北方靑年們、當閣馮諸逆陰謀叛變之初、吾人曾一再將其方行加以充分之剖解、絶對看出逆輩無絲毫革命的誠意、且充其所欲、必將斷送中國民族之生命、予三民義以重大之創傷、理論事實、咸具左證、全國同胞莫不瞭然、惟逆賊工於作惡、明明想保障封建勢力之存在、延長割據虐民之企圖、偏欲假言革命、僱用本黨曾經開除黨籍之落伍份子及一般無恥流氓、妄舉國民黨之名號、以搖惑我北方靑年同胞之耳目、今爲時已逾兩月、我靑年所身受者爲何物、逆氣遍佈於秦晋、我靑年所目覩者爲何事、慘痛憂傷、陰靈瞑合、知我靑年同胞已至欲笑不得欲哭無淚之境地矣、雖然民族復興之重任、仍寄託我靑年之兩肩、逆賊之橫行妄爲、正爲磨礪我靑年革命精神之良好機會、北方軍閥歷來對靑年之殘殺壓迫、無所不用其極、而若輩亦無不一一敗倒於靑年革命陣綫之前、從可知此次閻馮諸逆重温軍閥之舊夢、對靑年取更嚴酷之摧殘、其慘敗覆滅、自仍難逃進化的鐵例、所望我革命的北方靑年、辨淸目前之環境、愈勵鋤惡之决心、團結一致、共起救國、閻馮小醜、當不難加以徹底掊擊、人間正氣、庶幾得以完全伸張、靑　靑年、尙復何事躊躇耶、</p>
<p>茲再以閻馮數月來在北方各省區喪心病狂危害黨國之暴行、略舉一二、以爲我靑年告、</p>
<p>破壞革命、閻逆本不知有黨、更不懂革命與主義爲何物、彼前此所濫倡的荒謬絶倫之主張、旣被舉國所駁斥、遂乃變本加厲、暴力佔據中央在北方之機關、封閉北方各省市縣黨部、摧殘北方各地民衆運動、終於不顧一切、索性廢去國民革命之番號、大舉逮捕本黨黨員、詆毁總理三民主義、妄肆廢黨邪説、直欲將總理艱辛締造之革命大業、推翻消滅、使北方同胞將不見三民主義之曙光、不能受三民主義之實惠、其抗阻革命之逆行、與危害黨國之陰謀、日趨險惡、不僅爲本黨之罪人、實爲全國同胞之公敵、而彼所雇用之腐惡份子、如陳公博鄒魯等、已有軍事爲主黨政緩行之公開宣傳、我靑年同志同胞所得於若輩之領導、即此出賣革命之一語、尙復何求　閻馮二逆耶、</p>
<p>毒害人民、北方同胞、久處閻逆宰割蹂蹣之下、早已百業凋敝、民不聊生、加以天災頻仍、飢疫迭起、遂演成年來慘痛之奇災、赤地千里、十室九空、哀鴻遍野、死亡枕籍、中央及各公共機關、所運巨額之賑糧賑欵、悉遭閻逆扣留掠奪、置嗷嗷待哺之災民於不顧、尤復橫徵暴歛、搜括民財、田賦地丁預徵之四年以後、雜捐苛税、驟增至數十百種、濫發紙鈔、集中現金、販賣鴉片白丸、藉圖厚利、並徵奪民問車馬糧物、强拉農工靑年充當伕役、間有略事反抗、輒被嚴行追比、人民迫于淫威、乃不得不賣田鬻子、以塡其慾壑、致少壯轉於兵間、老弱流於道路、閻逆茶毒人民之苛政、猛虎之喻、尙不足以盡之也、</p>
<p>賣國媚外、閻逆近以罪惡昭彰、難以取信國人、供其一逞、乃乞憐於外邦、勾結帝國主義、以圖借外力、苟延殘喘、一方面以滄石鐵路及北方各省鑛區爲抵押、向帝國主義訂借大批外債、又以津海關崇文關爲抵、押向帝國主義者借欵二千萬元、一方面復甘受帝國主義軍械之接濟、延聘外人製造軍械、以作屠殺我革命民</p>

<p>接要聞</p>
<p>衆之工具、此項大規模之賣國殘民陰謀、直將中國北部半壁河山、蹂躪斷送無餘、前此袁曹諸賊之所不敢爲者、閻逆竟能悍然爲之而弗忌、其不顧國家民族之生存、實較曹汝霖章宗祥輩尤甚、喪心病狂、可謂極矣、</p>
<p>摧殘文化、閻逆破壞革命、殃民賣國、深恐其劣跡惡行、被人洩漏揭發、故不惜用專制手段、扣留郵政電報、鉗制言論機關、恣行搜檢拘捕、人民居住言論之自由、與生命財產之保障、皆已一無所有、平津各地報紙、除爲閻逆宣傳其土皇帝言行者得倖存外、其餘多遭封閉、且囚捕報館職員、百般凌虐、最近天津各報之被閻逆所誣蔑拘捕刑訊笞罰者、不勝其數慘無人道、遠過張賊宗昌萬萬、閻逆又爲羅掘民財起見、復不惜藉端封閉學校、攘奪敎育經費、致北方各地學校之閉門停辦者、日有所聞、靑年學生求學之塲所與機會、幾爲之剝奪凈盡、即如中央近所召集之全國敎育會議、乃爲籌畫發展各省各地敎育之重大集會、而閻逆亦用暴力阴止北方代表之參加、致我北方敎育專員之意見、不得一貢瓛於全敎大會、以作今後改進敎育之良圖、直欲使北方省敎育之生機、陷於破產而絶滅、凡此種種破壞敎育摧殘輿論之殘毒手段、前此北洋舊軍閥尙不肯爲、而閻逆爲之、至於一般靑年學生、天眞未泯、義憤所激、常有革命之言行、於是又大遭閻逆之嫉忌、不採法律之手續、肆行拘捕、不指爲共黨、則指爲間諜、幽囚監禁、無所不用某極、其稍爲激烈者、即行秘密處死、近月以來、僅平津各校連續被捕囚之靑年學生、已達數百、其未被捕者、處於積威暴壓之下、亦咸人人自危、而有偶語棄市之咸傷、又此次杭州舉行之全國運動大會、及首都全國童子軍總檢閲大會、北方各校靑年學生、莫不興高采烈、準備參加、不料亦爲閻逆暴力所阻、致我晋陜冀豫等省之英俊靑年、不得與全國之雄武健兒、共同縱橫馳聘於空前盛大集會之塲中、一顯我新中國少年雄壯威武之精神、乃竟使一腔熱情橫遭抨擊、是可見靑年學生行動意志之被摧殘壓迫、固不待言、即欲專心向學爲一太平之順民、尙不可得、是直置身泥犂地獄之中耳、我可敬可愛之北方靑年、尙能甘心忍此乎、</p>
<p>破壞交通、平漢津浦隴海諸鐵路、均爲北部與東南交通之幹綫、乃閻逆不惜以一已稱兵叛亂之故、即肆行拆斷鐵軌、炸燬橋樑、破壞沿綫之電桿、扣留各路之車輛、此實共黨土匪之故技、而閻逆從容爲之、致黃河長江之間、碩果僅存之縱橫路綫、破壞無餘、南北交通爲之隔斷、北方災民所渴望之賑濟、無法送達、致相率餓死而不知其救、閻逆不事建設、已爲人民之仇敵、今併已成之建設而破壞之、更爲黨國之罪魁矣、</p>
<p>上所列舉、特就其最近彰著者而言、即此數端亦已罪不容誅况閻逆種種劣跡暴行、尤爲筆所難宣者、綜觀其一生行事、不出歷史上奸賊叛將之慣技、而其作僞反覆陰很殘酷、又在任何軍閥之上、並且公然嘯聚腐惡反動份子於一隅、招集軍閥餘孽於幕下、而自居操緃一切反革命勢力之地位、圖向革命勢力作最後之一逞、方自詡八面玲瓏、應付有方可以一手掩盡天下耳目、實現其土皇帝之迷夢、殊不知反動份子蟻聚之日、即爲閻逆封建勢力崩潰之時、蓋若輩相見旣不以誠、所爭祇在權利、遂不免由鳥合而猜忌、由猜忌而内訌、不待外力之掃蕩、内部已形成土崩瓦解之趨勢、此所以有各派各系、忽而向閻以拒馮、忽而走馮以抗閻、鈎心鬭角、光怪陸離、僞政府之組織未成、自家先行火併之絶大笑柄也、</p>
<p>雖然、閻馮諸逆之反動勢力、固不足以撼搖黨國、而負隅困鬭、　尙足以延畏戰禍、加重同胞痛苦、則此輩反動集團之迅速剷除、實賴於本黨同志與全國同胞之努力、尤賴於我北方同胞北方靑年之更大的團結與奮鬭、我靑年同胞、當已深切認淸此次中央討伐閻逆、是革命與反革命之最後肉搏、閻逆此次挺身爲反革命之總頭目、率領一般反革命的殘餘勢力、來向革命作最後之總掙扎、亦不過自速其亡、我北方同胞尤其是北方靑年、不欲常受惡魔宰制、亟應及時振起摧鋤國賊之精神、一致奮起、揭發閻馮諸逆之罪惡贊助中央、早日剷除此輩封建運閥、給一切反革命勢力以整個的解决、俾得鞏固革命之基礎、開拓和平統一之新局、共策主義之推行、共登同胞於昇平之境域、北方靑年、其速奮起、</p>

<p>浙江省建設廳自成立以來。倐及三載。藉此三週年紀念。特舉行第一次建設展覽會。陳列七日。以廣宣傳。亦以使人民明瞭該省建設所獲之利益及眞義。意至善也。其陳列品都凡三千餘種。琳琅滿目。美不勝收。連日杭雖陰雨。而參觀者仍極踴躍。皆予好評。謂可與西湖博覽會媲美云。茲將見聞所及。拉雜記之　　張靜江冒雨而至該會於五月一日開幕。晨間微雨綿綿。而省府及地方要人均聯袂而至。浙府主席張靜江氏。亦冒雨而來。恭讀遺囑。各要人先後演説。盛道建廳過去及此次展覽之成績。嗣由該廳霍代廳長寳樹、報告一切。皆用無線電播音各方。是會莊嚴隆重。躋躋蹌蹌。遂於軍樂悠揚中攝影茶點而散。</p>
<p>滿室生春是夕即於開幕禮堂。舉行游藝大會。其節目均由該廳同人及附屬機關職員擔任。有京劇舞蹈魔術等等。霍氏亦客串其間。南腔北調。各見佳妙。霍本粤產。而國語亦殊流利上口。京劇尤稱工穩。滿室嘉賓。均興高采烈。鼓掌不止。嗣以電燈及無線電發明之電影説明殿後。可以增人科學智識。亦甚引人研究之興趣。</p>
<p>成績斐然該廳自霍代廳長及林秘書主任鋭意經營。凡百華新。此次陳列種種。成績斐然。尤足多也。其附屬機關凡二十九處分工商農礦水利交通四組陳列之。全體作丁字形。有各種型形圖表標本出產攝影諸項。自門首直至内室。秩序井然。而該廳六科之特種陳列。尤覺生色。</p>
<p>燈光燦爛該廳於通衢之間。另設標識。敦請各界參觀并於湖濱架牌樓一座。入夜光照十里。觀者塞途。訓政建設之空氣。充滿杭垣矣。</p>

<p>吾邑多崇山峻嶺。景色天然。白虎山之後。石洞環若列星。短尾猴（尾不逾寸）所聚居者也。猴性靈敏。鄕人每携瓷瓶鮮菓子往。旣至則卸之一隅。假寐洞旁。若憩息者。羣猴喜弄。恒出而攫所有去。鄕入竊覘其後。知猴之棲止。月餘復往。先於洞之附近鳴鞭砲數響。猴皆驚竄洞外。鄕人施施前來。直入其穴。則嚮之菓子。已釀成濃郁之冽酒滿貯十數瓶。乃一一携之去善飲者莫不謂其味較任何美酒爲醇。不知猴以何術製此佳釀也。</p>
<p>前本刊曾載某君一游記。力贊牛首山之勝景。謂爲新都第一。予抵京之翌日。即應友人章君之約。結隊往游。印象至佳。茲雜寫如次。</p>
<p>牛首山去京市僅二十餘里。邑誌所謂有四十里之遙者。實係夸辭。地屬江寗縣轄。自京市乘汽車或馬車均可直達。予等一行。共四人。所乘爲馬車。馬老且瘏。車夫復龍鍾不曉事過石子崗時。以崗路甚陡車夫拉馬便進。馬不受命。予等乃下車。自後推送。甫推至崗半。馬忽滑而後退。予等出全力以抵之。幸未僨事。</p>
<p>過石子崗至鐵心橋。天忽雨。予等皆大沮喪顧一見沿路之綠光滿眼草草花花。悉呈活意。呼吸之間。覺氣味爽俊無比。牛首山復囅然作迎人之笑。不覺豪氣大增。抵牛首山麓時。袖表之針穗。已指一時半。雨勢益强。予等乃躑躅於田家門外、乞借雨傘鄕人初不肯允。許以租資。乃得三傘。</p>
<p>張蓋前進曲折約行里許。始得一登山之徑。時雨勢少殺。四山已悉爲雲氣所籠。仰望牛首山巔。繞雲數匝。輕漾如烟。塔也。樓也。閣也。若有若無。觀之奇絶。予等鼓勇升山。至梅庵稍息。所謂梅庵者。即玉梅花館。祠屋數楹。奉淸道人祀位。守祠老人燒茶餉予等。在此大啖麵包。甚飽。</p>
<p>出玉梅花館至普覺寺。遍尋不得一僧。有一山童。領予等至寺旁觀塔、謂係蝙蝠、塔。過此有細徑可登山。乃以次游觀音洞。飲馬池。兜率宮。牛鼻子諸地。皆無可留連惟於捨身岩上。望迎面諸山。爲雲絮所裹。偶或作一開闔。如處子窺人。嫵媚極矣。時雨線又密。予等去傘危立。衣帽皆濕。而中心甚暢然也。</p>
<p>歸途、因事過小橋輪軸陷入橋下。幾致翻車。其險狀思之猶覺心悸。章君謂此爲游程中所最足紀念者信然</p>

<p>國曆五二。台州章一山師第三女公子師藴。又假中央大旅社行結婚禮。以一山師有幽憂之疾．又未親蒞主婚。梅璩見章夫人述師近狀。頗懸繫。賀客亦少。方逡巡欲退。一客趨前揖余而問訊。意至殷。乃坐而略談。客羅氏名止愚。一字子餘。年五十有五、厚重少文。誠慤可敬。先詢邦族。繼問一山師有女公子若而人。又問今日新郎家世才貌。略據所知。以爲酬答。旋因章夫人就余詳述一山師憂時之苦。兼及台州災况。子餘先生乃暢叙徽州生活之一切一切。聞之憬然。徽州本鉅郡＂子餘素服賈於鹽車。謂淮鹽近已處於絶境。税課抵押。私梟充斥。引商折閲殆盡。余曰。徽之郡。商業鼎盛固不僅恃淮鹽引地。以爲懋遷也。子餘蹙額曰。若茶。若漆。若竹木。皆爲徽產今已矣。茶紅氍毹</p>

<h3 id="c191">佛誕節的靜安寺路霖· <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>路邊市場一瞥</p>
<p>廢歷四月初八日、相傳是釋迦牟尼佛誕生的日子、這一天各寺院廟宇都很熱閙、善男信女燒香拜佛、比平時格外多、上海著名的靜安寺、也以這一天爲最熱閙、尤其是寺前寺後、迤遞里許的露天賣買、哄動遠近、靜安寺路不用説、靠近寺門的馬路兩旁攤肆櫛比擠得水泄不通、就是接近靜安寺一帶範圍的愚園路·大西路·極司非爾路·赫德路等一段、也有許多的臨時商塲出賣各種用品、人行道變了堆貨棧、馬路上頓見得擁腫非凡、小販的叫喊聲、顧客的爭噪聲、從馬路兩旁、直衝到馬路中間、每一個行人的脚步、被這一片聲音、絆住了遲緩不前、</p>
<p>沿馬路的許多攤肆、出賣各種東西、從笨重的黃沙磨刀石、到輕薄的綢緞零剪片、應有盡有、價錢從幾塊銀洋、到幾個銅圓、高下不等、論牠們的質料有竹·木·銅·鐵·石·等種種花色、顧客的種類、也有男女老少幼諸色人等、拿這許多東西、去應這許多人的需要閉了眼睛、也想象得出嘈雜的光景。許多物品中間、竹器最多、篾編的筐箕籃簍、觸目皆是、木器皮箱也很不少、圓的木桶、大大小小堆得像喇嘛塔一般、方的檯子、凳脚檯面差縱交橫、空隙的中間、常常露出人面來、這許多東西、製作粗拙、佔的地位也很大、可是筋骨堅固、久用不敝、所以路旁的　頭、雖是一年一度、臨時擺設、出賣的東西、却是久用的居多、竟可傳之子孫、做個永久的紀念、</p>
<p>靠近靜安寺大門、左右對面、攤基最多、買的顧客也最擁擠、山門前面、號稱天下第六泉的一口古井、被小販們層層包圍、見不到本來面目、井欄的四週擺滿了攤頭有的賣零剪綢布、有的賣銅鐵雜貨、還有搪瓷器皿手帕線襪、種種貨色、吸引了許多人駐足延頸、看個明白、要在平　、那口不波的的古井、悠悠千古、默默一世、有誰去憑吊、這幾天靠了如來尊者　法力、居然有許多老老小小、男男女女、向她包圍、井而有知、也許有一番喟嘆　、</p>
<p>買東西的顧客、以女太太們爲比較的多、摩登女子雖有、而勢力不大、大槪是這整千累萬的攤肆間、所出售的東西不配他　的胃口罷、的確、每個攤頭上的物品、有的古拙得像古董一般、有的簡單得毫無華飾、因爲十分之七八的東西、都是出之於人工手製、機製的物品不但不很多、並且不很精緻、曹家渡．小沙渡·梵皇渡·徐家匯等處來的上海鄉下人、採辦這種東西、在習慣於都市生活的人看起來、每每覺得拙陋異常、其實眞正的天字第一號國貨、還當求之於這種地方、</p>
<p>顧客中間也有外國人、最多的是印度人、其次格林好哇的英國兵、日本人也有幾個、在週游露天市塲十分鐘的中間、看見一個西洋婦人賣去一頂五彩油紙傘、代價很便宜不到一元、一個中等外國人帶領了妻子、從這個攤頭看到那個攤頭、結果在出售藤器的攤户上、買了兩只被撲、他拿了一只放在手裹、彈弄察看、好像研究中國的繡貨玉器、很用心思、最後交給他的幼女、滿面春風的去了、還有個日本人帶了他的女人、在一個賣鐵器雜貨的攤上、買小洋刀、灣了腰在盤裹東揀西揀、拿了一柄刀、反覆玩弄、不時用趣味濃厚的面孔、向着他的太太笑語、大槪這位日本先生、也在買他的國貨哩、頭繞紅綠頭巾的印度人、黑油油的臉上、露出一種莫名其妙的笑容、在人叢中穿來穿去、有幾個「好整以暇」坐在一家水菓店門口、大喝荷囒水還有幾個、用不中不印的上海土白、對一個女子搭談、那女予朝他駡了幾聲、他却很得意的舞着手杖、慢慢的踅過去了、大槪甘地的不合作主義、與他們永遠不發生關係的、</p>
<p>各種日用品中間、有幾件市上不容易賣到、像車輪般大的木砧塊、二三十斤重的磨刀石、笨重粗拙、很可以表這路邊市塲的特色、其他的東西像竹椅子等、也是市上不很經見的、許多竹筐木桶、堆得很高、不用説明、不用廣告、顧客們一望之下、就很明瞭這種東西的用途、不過慣住在都市裹的摩登女子、也許有幾件東西他們見了呌不出名字、各種物件、存貨都十分充足、高堆橫攤、遠望過去、只見許多人在東西中間、穿出穿進、</p>
<p>路邊市塲的日期、從四月四日開始、到九日纔止、前後一共六天、那幾天靜安寺路上、車水馬龍、熱閙非常、靜安寺裹面、從天王殿直到大雄寳殿、朝朝夜夜進香的絡繹不絶、有些人並不去燒香、其目的只在賣東西、至於燒香的人連帶去賣東西、那是更多的了、在這一個佛誕節裹、靜安寺路盛况的印象、去過的人大致不容易磨滅、可是在這個當兒有一件事、也很値得注意、那路邊市塲的中間、有一處地方「大佈道」、佈講基督敎的道理、門口有一塊佈告寫着「不取分文、大佈道、五日五六七日····」、趁這佛誕節時候佈道、免不掉有點煞風景罷、</p>
<p>英海峽隧道計畫將實現</p>
<p>據法報云、一九三○年三月之一晨、全法國人民得一最可異之消息、此消息、法人已待之八十年、以爲其終不來矣、而今乃果來、即英政府於十二個月前所舉出之一英人委員會已造成報告、幾全體贊成於海峽（英吉利海峽）中開一隧道、如是本世代之人將有機會目覩一奇事、即英國將不復爲一島國、而由一鐵路與歐洲大陸相連接、</p>
<p>法國與不列顚羣島間隧道成功後、其將引起之變遷如何、在吾人之想像中、幾至無限、</p>
<p>第一、世界中最可怖之短海行程之一行將終止、從歐陸赴英之游客將大增多、英人之游歐洲各歷史勝地者亦將激增、今則因畏渡海峽、多裹足不前也、總之、此將改變許多英人之島國人的心量、同時使許多大陸人對於英人較爲諒解、</p>
<p>第一、爲節省時間、夫節省時間非伴於近代文明之一大目的乎、目下自巴黎至倫敦、需七小時有半、隧道成後、可省兩小時、巴黎人可於晨八時出發、至倫敦午餐、午後游覽、半夜前返巴黎、在某種塲合省時可更多、例如東方人游英者、在馬賽之陸、由直通鐵路可以十五小時到倫敦、目下則需一夜一日也、</p>
<p>而其最大之革命、乃在商業、從英國各製造市運貨至大陸各地、不必卸貨重裝、從大陸至英亦然、如是英商業可開發新市塲大陸對英貿易亦將大獲便利、有人計算、開築隧道、需時七年、英國失業工人因此可有數千名被雇用、其利大矣、然隧道成後、外人游英者衆、英國商業所獲之利、豈算數所能知耶、</p>
<p>英國報告告中預料開掘隧、道在地質上或工程上均無困難、法方之報告亦然、就地質上言、海峽底之白堊質之搆成上並無罅隙、曾經施行試騐鑽掘八千次、證明此項信心、即謂竟有罅隙在近代工程學亦無不可能之工作、</p>
<p>就各方面觀察、苟有可疑之點、厥爲經費一項、據熱烈贊助此隧道計畫之羅什米挨貴族所信、此計畫可有贏無失、其言云、『全部用費約計三千萬鎊、每年用此隧道之人預計至少四百萬、目下以船渡峽、每客付費平均十六先令、將來四百萬人之付費苟逾此數、即每年載客收入一項達三百二十萬鎊、此外運貨收入預計爲八十萬鎊連前項共四百萬鎊、除去業務支出五十萬鎊、結果凈收入成一分之上之贏利』、</p>
<p>而依法國最大鐵路權威者現任法蘭西北方鐵路總理茄伐雷氏之計算、則與羅什米挨貴族異、茄氏亦積極贊助隊道計畫者、但彼信在開成伊始載客及運貨兩項收入未必能逾三百萬鎊、而業務支出至少需八十萬鎊、如是投資所獲之利殊菲、然而吾人以爲此金錢問題乃次要之問題、即使隊道開成年利可獲、亦應開之、蓋精神的智識的政治的商業的利益遙大於金錢的利益也、假令英國及法國之資本家眼光短而膽力小、遲疑於合任此艱鉅美國之金融界應以其從前開巴拿馬運河之精神更開此英吉利海峽、冒一時之險、而享未來之利、</p>
<p>總之、吾人希望隧道工程早日開始、至一九三七年、有第一人能以鐵路達英國、不亦懿歟、</p>

<p>第三十八章十九世紀蘭法西的散文</p>
<p>杜德的友人厄特蒙杜龔古爾及他的弟尤耳是自然主義者、或者更恰當地説來、則視覺主義者、的指導者他們對於一生、與其説是見其爲故事的材料、不如説是見其爲繪畫的詳細的記述的材料、然而照斯蒂芬孫所説、算是文學的典型底法式的故事却勝過他們的理論、而在他們的小説的數篇、倘只舉出一種來、則「核耐摩拍林」中、他們是將故事的古藝術和在他們手中多少算是新東西的人物的内面作用的綿密的分析或印象描寫這一種藝術結合在一起的、比小説更爲重要的是「日記」、這不獨是作者的信念和人格的表現、還是十九世紀的法蘭西文學上煌然直射的光、厄特蒙杜龔古爾爲創立「翰林院」Academic而遺留財產、這在其發端本是對於官立的法蘭西學士院的一個抗議、現在却是一般公認的一個組織了、牠對於文學底功績的無上的實質底賞金、是凡有法蘭西的靑年作家所渴望的、這一向是在法蘭西文學上擁護自由和勇氣的强大的力、</p>
<p>受了龔古爾的深深的影響、却也有着怪僻模樣猛烈的意志和力而行走自已的路的是JK羽斯芒、他在「結婚生活」似的小説、作爲左拉一派的寫實主義者開始、而告終於宗敎底神秘主義、例如「大寺院」、羽斯芒没有充分地、或者不曾經嘗試的二三種書中、適切地被翻譯爲英語、他那色彩濃厚的色彩難以翻譯、他分明是作者的作者、文學者的愛寵、然而他將來在法蘭西、又在其他諸國必至於更加出名的、</p>
<p>有各類的讀者都能感知的美的細巧的美術家是死於一九二三年的披耳綠諦他是海軍大官見過不少的世界、且感到海和異域的士的魔力、他的經騐和印象、他巧妙地誠實地重現於他的小説及回顧錄、他在南海見到「綠諦的結婚」、在日本、則「菊子夫人」、在布勒通海岸及北海、則「挨斯蘭的漁夫」、他又將他的敏感的人格滲入於外面底記述和事件、</p>
<p>綠諦是印象主義者、在他看來、世界是色彩·是感覺、又無論在那里、是和善惡觀念中的道德並無什麽關係的經騐、保爾部爾熱是逐漸傾向於保守底道德底人生觀的、鋭敏的、毋寗説是嚴肅的社會的研究者、他進逼他所描出的人物的内心、倘使他的態度少些紳士氣味、則會打到我們的内心的、然而他是藝術家、而「弟子」和「約定的地」是有第一流的價値的小説、部爾熱和他的時代在其分析有些苛酷而過分着實在其人生觀則是保守底的、大戰以前、有過照了新理想主義的光而見「生」的年靑的、却不能説是穉幼的人們、其中的主要人物是羅曼羅蘭、他的「若望克利司朶夫」是以在法蘭西獲得一部分經騐的德意志的音樂家爲其主人公的國際底小説、雖然這是長得無限的、但在法蘭西、且以其英譯而言、這却是被廣讀的、他的精神是擁抱世界的、然而世界擁抱在一九一四年却成爲死的把握了、羅曼羅蘭在稱爲「在戰鬥之上」的這小册子、努力要升到其上、爲了這小册子、及其他的人道底的文章、他没有獲得聲望於戰鬥底國人之間、阿那托爾法蘭西則維持了特權底舊時代的靜謐、亨利排部士（在「火」）及其他的作家則是利用了戰爭的、</p>

<p>宮主們宴客了、</p>
<p>爲了要使地點適宜宮主們只得將就些擇定了一家附近校舍較爲淸潔的小飲食店裹宴客了、時間是在下午七時正當飯市將收的時候、腌臢的小飯廳雖已空着、那零亂的桌椅、狼藉的杯盤、却還没有收拾整齊、宮主們深恐被邀的公子們肚餓催促着跑堂的趕快收拾一面自已還帮着佈置、汗香從衣裳裹透出來與油膩的空氣混合了、蓬鬆的秀髮更加蓬鬆了、經過一陣忙碌之後小飯廳居然換了新氣象、零亂的桌子凑在一起成了長方形的餐桌、上面蒙上了潔白的檯布、中間再供着幾盆花草這樣一來的確美麗得多了、</p>
<p>除了佈置之外、每一個座位的面前、還放着一張精美細巧的名片、這樣好使公子們按位就座不致把宮主們所預定的次序弄亂名片上的花紋是用顏色墨水灑成的、非常的美麗、聽説這是宮主們費了許多時間親手特製的一切舒齊之後客主們就遣跑堂的去請那隔在另一室裹的被邀的公子們入座、原來急性的公子們很早就來了、宮主們因恐站在旁邊、於佈置上有些不方便所以把他們一個個都塞到另一室裹去候着、此時公子們果然像宮主們所臆度的肚餓了、不停地看着時計及等到跑堂的説了一聲請字之後、飛也似的都在飯廳裹一個個出現了、他們都穿着西裝、直挺挺的褲脚、加上一條很明顯而有稜模的褶痕、腰背硬杯板地筆直的豎着、雖然有一二個瘦得像黃鼠狼似以矮小、可是氣槪却也非凡、頭頸用力向上伸長着、幾乎把矮的缺點都瞞得過了、還有一位眼神白花花的、却釘視着一位宮主在微笑宮主們也笑着招呼他們、</p>
<p>入座了菜一盤一盤的送上來、肚餓的公子們均把笑聲歛住了、忙着把嘴唇上下搬動、但是還不能應付從手裹送來的一筷一筷的食物、滋味到還有點空工夫去辨别、因爲他們都暗奇着那愚笨的廚子、竟也能烹出這樣美味的菜呢</p>
<p>宮主們想起了她們所預備好的餘興、趁着大家埋首盆底的時候、趕忙把紙籃提出來了、籃内裝着許多摺成同心結的紙條紙條上寫着各種的動作與歌唱挨着坐位令每人各拈一條拈完後、公子們見了紙條上所寫的、均有黠期期艾艾地不肯執行、然而怎經得起那嚴厲的司令宮主的督促呢於是歡聲又起了、發笑的動作、刺耳的歌曲．接一連二地表演着歌唱着、有的對着對面的人叩首、有的效着鳥獸的啼吼、有的在地上打着跟斗、有的．．．．．．有的．．．．．．</p>
<p>在狂歡的笑聲裹、公子們與宮主們散席了、寂靜的馬路、頓時散佈着愉快的空氣、月兒也眞會凑趣、放出異樣的光芒、來照着那胸中懷着不可名狀的快感的驕子、送回宮去、</p>

<p>中央大學建築大禮堂的消息、兩年前已有所聞了、惟初以經費無着、致成畫餅、到了客年張校長在紀念週上重提出討論、并云不論如何今年二三月必興工、六個月也必完成建築、於是建築大禮堂的呼嘯、不覺地又唱起來、當時我們學生在這種山雨欲來風滿樓的情狀之下、眞爲之雀躍不置、</p>
<p>呵、我們這「雀躍不置」的情緖、直到今年三月二十八日、大禮堂的工程果然興工了當在這建築工程未竣之時、讓我把中央大學建築大禮堂的種種事情來談一談罷、</p>
<p>中央大學現在校内的建築、均有具體計畫、前東大時曾聘美人孟菲設計全校圖樣、現在新添建築、大槪均照此圖進行、最近建造大禮堂的計劃及圖樣、當然也不能逃出例外、又該校上學期第十二次行政會議曾議决、無論建築任何房屋、費用在五千元以上者、必須設一工程建築稽核委員會以便討論、所以這次建造大禮堂也依照此議决案實行、先組織一個工程建築稽核委員會、由張校長分别函聘懋解·盧樹森·劉福泰·劉敦楨·林平一·余立基·王明之·薛紹淸·張逸喬·查嘯仙等十人爲大禮堂建築委員會委員、但前年組織工程建築稽核委員會時、係尙在大學區制時代、大禮堂裹之辦公室之分配、爲預備大學本部及行政院兩處之用、現在大學區制取消、行政院結束、辦公室已有改動、所以大禮堂的圖樣也有更變了、據去年十二月二十三日總理紀念週張校長報告大禮堂的圖樣如下、</p>
<p>「大禮堂地點位於大中路盡頭、與大門相對、即在平房宿舍之前、以科學館居其左、將來擬建之工藝館居其右、科學館之前爲生物館、工藝館之前爲圖書館、此五種建築並立、而禮堂居於中央、成泉星拱衛北辰之勢、禮堂之前、甬道環成圓形、中間擬建總理銅像、禮堂式樣採取歐洲古式、其前面之角頂及四圓柱爲希臘式、中間圓頂爲羅馬式、自底至頂、高百零四尺、頂係銅質上有不傳熱之玻璃窗、光線即由此玻璃窗導入禮堂、禮堂之兩旁、左面爲辦公室、右面爲敎授交際室、其上有屋頂花園、堂之平面成八角形、講臺甚大、并可作戲臺之用、其旁尙有化裝室、内部共有三層、第二及第三層有樓廂及辦公室、第三層有電影機室、總計上下三層可容二千五百人、」（以上見中央大學十八年十二月二十四日日刊）。</p>

<h3 id="e7">The Seriousness of the Spanish Political Situation <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>At a time when democratic rule is prevalent, to still blindly believe in the Italianization of dictatorial politics, if the government has had a strong base, it can barely maintain itself for a while. If the government is weak, but it obstinately refuses to change and does not know how to adapt to the circumstances, then there will be nothing but turmoil. Spain's Rivera, known as one of the three great dictators, could be said to have had unquestionable authority and used various methods to quell the resistance of the people. However, he eventually reached the end of his power and fell. General Berenguer, who succeeded him in power, was far less powerful than his predecessor Rivera. Although he initially tried to deny that he was continuing the policies of the previous cabinet and tried to appease the opposition, he actually followed the path of dictatorship in everything and still wanted to maintain the authority of the royal party. Therefore, the resurgence of revolutionary storms was not something that could only be known today.</p>
<p>After the revolutionary storm arose, it was inevitable that more oppressive measures would be taken. Assemblies and associations were strictly prohibited, and the already restored freedom of speech was revoked. As a result, the more oppressive the measures, the faster the progress of the revolution. Of particular note is that Spanish students have always been silent, but in this revolutionary movement, university students suddenly became the center. Therefore, the authorities hurriedly closed schools and ordered a professor, the leader of the students, to return to his hometown to teach, believing that from then on there would be no one to instigate and the student movement could be eliminated. In fact, students have been brewing revolution for a long time. During the era of opposition to Rivera's dictatorship and advocacy for the restoration of constitutionalism, the famous writer Ibn Ynez strongly advocated the theory of democratic politics. Its seeds have long been spread throughout the nation's youth. Today's student movement is only harvesting the results of maturity. How can it be eliminated by closing one or two schools and expelling one or two professors? In short, in this era, even if constitutionalism can be truly restored and elections can be held, today's revolutionary movement cannot be quelled. Moreover, it is only using constitutional restoration as a means of appeasement, while actually wanting to maintain its dictatorial power. From this point of view, the turmoil in Spain is far from over.</p>

According to a captured rebel army company commander, during the previous battles between Zhang and Gui's armies and the Central Army in Guangdong, they suffered great losses from the Central Army's aircraft bombings. The account is as follows: (1) When the two armies were fighting in Guangdong, more than fifty Central Army aircraft were used in group formations. Initially, our army did not take precautions, thinking they were not very capable. Therefore, all air defense equipment was not set up. There were no anti-aircraft guns, and the trenches were not equipped with concrete shelters, so there was no way to resist when the Central Army's aircraft carried out bombing; (2) The senior officers of our army used tall buildings as headquarters, which were discovered by the Central Army's aircraft and bombed into rubble, resulting in many casualties. Later, they moved into small houses or took refuge in villages, which were not easily detected by the Central aircraft, and they began to feel more at ease, which shows the power of the Central Army's aircraft and the power of the bombing. Once, the Central Army's aircraft dropped a 150-pound bomb, killing more than fifty people; (3) When our army marched, they often took dense formations, and they all rested in villages. The officers and soldiers were afraid of aircraft like tigers. When they saw aircraft flying from a distance, they immediately fled in all directions. The division commander, fearing that military discipline could not be maintained, immediately ordered strict prohibition. All officers and soldiers were not allowed to move, lie down, or disperse when they saw an aircraft. Therefore, more people were killed and injured by the Central Army's aircraft bombs; (4) When the Central Army and our army met in Beiliu, the two armies took enveloping attacks or flanking maneuvers. The two sides fought in hand-to-hand combat, which was unbearable to witness. The Central Army's aircraft and Central Army units attacked together, causing more than 20,000 casualties in our army. Even one part of Division Commander Zhang Fakui suffered more than 5,000 casualties. Corpses piled up like mountains, and blood flowed like canals. (7th dispatch)</p>

<p>Second Stage of Debate in the Lower House Begins</p>
<p>▲ Japan United, Tokyo, 7th - The government's supplementary budget bill was returned to the House of Peers today. The plenary session of the Upper House, which convened at 10:00 a.m. today, combined the six supplementary budget bills into one agenda item. Finance Minister Inoue took the stage to give a speech, and the questioning began immediately. The compulsory education fee bill, the export compensation bill, and various other bills submitted by the government were also put on the agenda in the House of Representatives on the 7th and are expected to pass. Thus, the first stage of the battle in the House of Representatives will come to an end. The second stage of the battle, namely the political struggle of the general impeachment case, will be realized. In the future, the focus of discussion will be concentrated in the House of Peers, and anti-government members in that House intend to attack the government on the issues of increasing compulsory education fees, unemployment, and the management of the Minister of the Army's affairs. Prime Minister Hamaguchi is working hard to achieve understanding in the House of Peers for safety's sake.</p>
<p>Lower House Situation Regarding the Passing of Budget Bill</p>
<p>Members of the Seiyukai Party Request Withdrawal of Original Bill</p>
<p>Government Relies on Absolute Majority to Win Victory</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 7th - The General Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, which discussed the supplementary budget bill, convened at 1:00 p.m. on the 6th. First, Budget Committee Chairman Morita gave a detailed report on the committee's deliberation process and results. Then, the six supplementary budget bills were taken up as the agenda item and entered into discussion. Moto Sanji took the stage to advocate the budget return theory and strongly attacked the government. Next, Okuchi Kita of the Seiyukai took the stage, first pointing out that the government's estimate of tax revenue was too high, and that it was too indifferent to the economization of military spending. He also said that the government was not saving where it should save, and was tightening where it should not tighten. Therefore, "we believe that the current cabinet's financial and economic policies are fundamentally wrong. Such erroneous policies are destroying the foundation of Japanese industry. The government should humbly recognize its mistakes, withdraw the budget, and compile a new one." He strongly advocated returning the budget and left the stage. Next, a representative from the Minseito Party took the stage to rebut and extol the government's bill. Then, Togo Minoru of the Seiyukai took the stage, saying that the group most heavily affected by the lifting of the ban was the rural villages. "Looking at the supplementary budget now, there is no countermeasure for the rural villages, and rural expenses are being cut. Those who welcome the government's non-debt-raising doctrine are only the few wealthy people who own the majority of government bonds." He further discussed the problems related to the Colonial Affairs Ministry, the disarmament conference, and other issues, strongly attacking the government, and stated his support for the return theory before leaving the stage. Then, Okamoto Jitsutaro of the Minseito moved to end the discussion. Prime Minister Hamaguchi, with a leisurely attitude, took the stage amidst applause from his party, saying that the members of the Seiyukai advocated returning the budget, but the content of their discussion was always about financial and economic theory, so the reason for the return was very weak. The government has compiled the supplementary budget with a certain policy, and it has firm confidence in the policies it contains, so the government absolutely opposes the request to withdraw the budget. He expressed the government's attitude and left the stage amidst cheers from his party. The vote was then taken. Chairman Fujisawa declared, "Those who support the budget return theory proposed by the Seiyukai, please stand up." Only the Seiyukai and the Kokumin Doshikai stood up. "Next, those who support the original budget proposal proposed by the government, please stand up." The Minseito and the Innovation Party stood up (the Proletarian Party abstained, not standing up for either side). Then, Chairman Fujisawa declared that the various supplementary budget proposals proposed by the government had been passed by a majority. The deliberations ended completely at this point, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Central Propaganda Department Addresses Northern Youth Again <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Central Propaganda Department recently issued another letter to the youth of Shanxi, Hebei, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Henan provinces. The original text is as follows: "Dear Northern Youth, at the beginning of the plot of rebellion by the traitorous warlords Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan, we repeatedly analyzed their actions in detail and absolutely saw that these traitors had no sincere revolutionary intentions. If they achieve their desires, they will surely destroy the life of the Chinese nation and inflict a major wound on the Three Principles of the People. Theory and facts are both proof, and the people of the country are all aware of this. However, the traitors are good at doing evil, and although they clearly want to protect the existence of feudal forces and prolong their attempts to divide and abuse the people, they stubbornly pretend to be revolutionary, employ dismissed members of our party who have been expelled from the party and a general mob of shameless rascals, and falsely use the name of the Kuomintang to confuse the eyes and ears of our northern youth compatriots. Now it has been more than two months, and what have our youth received? Treacherousness pervades Qin and Jin, and what have our youth witnessed? Pain and sorrow, dark spirits closing together, know that our youth compatriots have reached a state where they cannot laugh or cry. Although the heavy responsibility of national revival still rests on the shoulders of our youth, the recklessness of the traitors is a good opportunity to hone the revolutionary spirit of our youth. The northern warlords have always done everything possible to massacre and oppress the youth, but these people have all fallen one by one before the revolutionary front of the youth. From this, we can know that this time the traitors Yan and Feng are revisiting the old dreams of the warlords and taking more cruel destruction against the youth. Their tragic defeat and destruction will inevitably escape the iron rule of evolution. We hope that our revolutionary northern youth will distinguish the current environment, strengthen their determination to eradicate evil, unite as one, and rise up to save the country together. The clowns Yan and Feng will not be difficult to completely eradicate, and the righteousness of the world will be completely extended. What is there for the youth to hesitate about?"</p>
<p>Now, we will list one or two of the insane and harmful acts of Yan and Feng in the northern provinces in recent months to tell our youth,</p>
<p>Destroying the revolution, Yan does not know that there is a party, let alone understand what revolution and doctrine are. His absurd and outrageous propositions that he advocated earlier have been refuted by the whole country, and he has intensified his efforts, violently occupying the central organs in the north, closing the party headquarters in the northern provinces, cities, and counties, and destroying the mass movement in the north. Finally, regardless of everything, he simply abolished the banner of the National Revolution, arrested members of our party, slandered the Three Principles of the People of the Premier Sun Yat-sen, and recklessly preached the heresy of abolishing the party, intending to overthrow and eliminate the revolutionary cause that the Premier had worked so hard to create, so that the northern compatriots would not see the dawn of the Three Principles of the People, and could not receive the benefits of the Three Principles of the People. His counter-revolutionary and harmful conspiracy to the party and the country is becoming increasingly sinister. Not only is he a sinner of our party, but he is also a public enemy of the people of the country. The corrupt and evil elements he employs, such as Chen Gongbo and Zou Lu, have already openly promoted the military as the main body and party administration as a slow process. What our youth comrades and compatriots have gained from the leadership of these people is the one word of selling out the revolution. What else do you want from Yan and Feng?</p>
<p>Poisoning the people, the northern compatriots have been under the control of Yan for a long time, and all industries have long been withered, and the people are struggling to survive. In addition, natural disasters occur frequently, and famine and epidemics arise one after another, which has resulted in a tragic disaster in recent years. The land is red for thousands of miles, and nine out of ten houses are empty. Mournful cries are heard everywhere, and deaths are commonplace. The huge amount of relief food and money transported by the central government and various public organs were all detained and plundered by Yan, ignoring the starving victims. In addition, he levied excessive taxes and squeezed the people's wealth. The land tax and land tax have been pre-collected for four years, and miscellaneous donations and exorbitant taxes have suddenly increased to dozens of hundreds of kinds. He issued banknotes arbitrarily, centralized cash, and sold opium white pills to make huge profits. He also requisitioned civilian vehicles, horses, food, and materials, and forcibly pulled peasants, workers, and youth to serve as corvée laborers. If there was any slight resistance, he would be strictly pursued. The people were forced by coercion and had to sell their fields and sell their children to fill his insatiable desires, resulting in young and strong men turning to the army, and the old and weak flowing to the roads. Yan's harsh government of poisoning the people, the metaphor of a tiger, is not enough to exhaust it.</p>
<p>Selling the country and flattering foreigners, Yan's guilt has recently become known, making it difficult to win the trust of the people of the country for him to do as he pleases. He begged for mercy from foreign countries and colluded with imperialism in an attempt to use foreign forces to prolong his life. On the one hand, he mortgaged the Cangshi Railway and the mining areas of the northern provinces to imperialism to borrow a large amount of foreign debt. He also mortgaged Tianjin Customs and Chongwen Customs to imperialists to borrow 20 million yuan. On the one hand, he was willing to accept the supply of imperialist arms, and hired foreigners to manufacture arms for the slaughter of our revolutionary people.</p>

<p>Brief News Compilation</p>
<p>a tool of the masses. This large-scale treasonous and oppressive scheme will completely devastate and forfeit half of Northern China. What those traitors Yuan and Cao dared not do, the rebel Yan is now brazenly doing without restraint. His disregard for the survival of the nation and the people surpasses even Cao Rulin and Zhang Zongxiang's ilk. His loss of conscience and madness can be described as extreme.</p>
<p>Destroying Culture: The rebel Yan, in his destruction of revolution and oppression of the people, is deeply afraid that his inferior actions and evil deeds will be leaked and exposed. Therefore, he spares no effort in using autocratic methods to withhold postal services and telegrams, control the media, and arbitrarily conduct searches and arrests. The people's freedom of residence and speech, as well as the protection of life and property, have all been lost. In Peiping and Tientsin, apart from newspapers that promote the rebel Yan as a local emperor, the rest have mostly been shut down. Furthermore, newspaper staff are imprisoned, abused in every way, and subjected to torture and beatings. Recently, the number of newspapers in Tientsin that have been slandered, arrested, interrogated, flogged, and punished by the rebel Yan is countless and inhumane, far exceeding the bandit Zhang Zongchang tenfold. The rebel Yan, in order to plunder the people's wealth, does not hesitate to close schools on any pretext, seize educational funds, causing the closure and suspension of schools in various parts of the north to be heard daily. The places and opportunities for young students to seek knowledge have been almost completely deprived. For example, the recent National Education Conference convened by the Central Government, a major gathering to plan the development of education in various provinces and regions, was forcibly prevented from attending by the rebel Yan, causing the opinions of our Northern education commissioners to be unable to contribute to the General Education Conference, to serve as a good plan for improving education in the future. He intends to make the vitality of education in the Northern provinces bankrupt and extinct. All these kinds of destructive education and suppression of public opinion are something that even the old Northern warlords were unwilling to do, but the rebel Yan does. As for ordinary young students, with their naive and unextinguished sense of justice, they often have revolutionary words and deeds. As a result, they are greatly envied by the rebel Yan, who does not follow legal procedures, but arbitrarily arrests them, labeling them as either Communists or spies, and imprisoning them without using any extreme means. Those who are slightly more radical are secretly executed. In recent months, only in Peiping and Tientsin, hundreds of young students from various schools have been continuously arrested and imprisoned. Those who have not been arrested are under the pressure of accumulated power and violence, and everyone is in danger, with the sadness of "accidental speech leads to market execution." Moreover, the young students from various schools in the North were all excited and preparing to participate in the National Games held in Hangzhou this time and the National Scout Jamboree in the capital. Unexpectedly, they were also obstructed by the violence of the rebel Yan, causing the outstanding youths from our Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces to be unable to compete with the heroic and valiant athletes of the whole country in this unprecedented grand gathering, to show the heroic and majestic spirit of our new Chinese youth. As a result, a burst of enthusiasm was attacked. It can be seen that the actions and will of young students are being crushed and oppressed. It is not to mention that even if one wants to concentrate on studying and be a peaceful and obedient citizen, it is still impossible. It is like being in a mud hell. Can our respectable and lovable Northern youths still willingly endure this?</p>
<p>Destroying Transportation: The Peiping-Hankow, Tientsin-Pukou, and Longhai railways are all trunk lines for transportation between the North and the Southeast. However, the rebel Yan, at the cost of starting a rebellion,肆行拆斷鐵軌、炸燬橋樑、破壞沿綫之電桿、扣留各路之車輛, deliberately dismantled railway tracks, blew up bridges, destroyed telegraph poles along the lines, and detained vehicles on various lines. This is actually the old trick of the Communist bandits, but the rebel Yan does it calmly, causing the few remaining vertical and horizontal lines between the Yellow River and the Yangtze River to be completely destroyed, cutting off North-South transportation. The relief that the disaster victims in the North long for cannot be delivered, causing them to starve to death without knowing their rescue. The rebel Yan does not engage in construction and is already the enemy of the people. Now he is destroying what has already been built, making him even more of a criminal against the party and the country.</p>
<p>The above is just a brief mention of the recent prominent events. These few alone are already unforgivable. Moreover, the rebel Yan's various inferior acts and atrocities are even more difficult to describe in writing. Looking at his life's actions, it is nothing more than the habitual tricks of treacherous and rebellious generals in history. Moreover, his hypocrisy, fickleness, insidiousness, cruelty, and viciousness are above any warlord. Furthermore, he openly gathers corrupt and reactionary elements in one corner, recruits remnants of warlords under his command, and assumes the position of manipulating all counter-revolutionary forces, attempting to make a final attempt against revolutionary forces. He boasts that he is sophisticated and capable of deceiving the world and realizing his dream of being a local emperor. He does not know that the day when reactionary elements gather is the time when the rebel Yan's feudal forces collapse. Because these people do not treat each other with sincerity, and their struggle is only for power, they cannot avoid suspicion due to their temporary alliance, and internal strife due to suspicion. Without the suppression of external forces, an internal trend of disintegration has already formed. This is why there are various factions and systems, sometimes turning to Yan to resist Feng, and sometimes turning to Feng to resist Yan, engaging in intrigue and bizarre behavior, creating the great laughingstock of a pseudo-government that is not yet formed, but self-destruction comes first.</p>
<p>Although the reactionary forces of the rebels Yan and Feng are not enough to shake the party and the country, they are still sufficient to prolong the war and increase the suffering of compatriots. Therefore, the rapid eradication of these reactionary groups depends on the efforts of our party comrades and compatriots across the country, especially the greater unity and struggle of our Northern compatriots and Northern youths. Our young compatriots should have deeply recognized that this Central Government's suppression of the rebel Yan is the final hand-to-hand combat between revolution and counter-revolution. The rebel Yan has now stood up as the chief culprit of counter-revolution, leading a group of remaining counter-revolutionary forces to make a final struggle against the revolution, which is nothing more than accelerating his demise. Our Northern compatriots, especially Northern youths, who do not want to be controlled by demons forever, should promptly rise up to eliminate the national traitors, unite and rise up, expose the crimes of the rebels Yan and Feng, and support the Central Government to eradicate these feudal warlords as soon as possible, to give a complete solution to all counter-revolutionary forces, so as to consolidate the foundation of the revolution, open up a new situation of peace and unity, jointly promote the implementation of the Three Principles of the People, and jointly lead compatriots to a peaceful realm. Northern youths, rise up quickly!</p>

<p>The conference will open on the 5th. Yesterday afternoon, before his departure, Mo sent a telegram to various parties, which read: "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, and forwarded to the Provincial Party Headquarters of each province, the Party Headquarters of each special municipality, all legal entities, and all newspapers; Greetings to Chairman Zhang of Liaoning, Chairman Zhang of Jilin, Chairman Wan of Heilongjiang, and Chairman Tang of Rehe. By order, Dehui is sent to Russia, and I have declined several times without success. I will do my best to fulfill this arduous task. Now I have decided to depart for abroad on May 1st. Considering that the Sino-Russian issues have been accumulated for many years, and the agenda of the Eastern Route is complex and extensive. The opening of the conference is a great responsibility. I want to enhance the international status and consolidate the peace of East Asia. I will do my best and not shirk my responsibility. However, at a time when the country is in difficulty and diplomacy is serious, I think about past negotiations, hold a fearless spirit, and dare to say that I will not fail in my mission. I hope that I will not be forgotten in the distance, and that you will treat me well in my travels. I hope that we can help each other and avoid failure. I am packing and waiting for your instructions. Mo Dehui bows 30 times." The railway bureau first attached nine carriages of special trains and three carriages of official cars on the evening of the 30th. The other first and second class sleeping cars and dining cars were also prepared and towed to the main station. Each special commissioner and staff member boarded the train that night. The East Railway purchased two cars for 15,000 rubles and loaded them into Russia for the delegation to use. At about 9:00 AM on the 1st, the station inside and outside was filled with military police, and the roofs of the station buildings were decorated with the national emblems of China and the Soviet Union. People from all walks of life who came to the station to see them off arrived in succession, numbering several thousand. The railway police department, due to the large number of people on the platform and because today is the May 1st Labor Day, feared unexpected actions, so those from various agencies who came to see them off had to show their cards, and the business community had to show the special identification cards made by the chamber of commerce. At about 10:00 AM, the platform was already crowded. Mr. Mo Dehui arrived at the station at this time. The Chief Executive of the Special Zone, Zhang Jinghui, and other leaders set up refreshments in the VIP waiting room to bid farewell. Mo slightly used some tea and fruit, and then boarded the train at 10:20 AM. At 10:25 AM, the bell rang and the train departed. The military band played in unison, and the well-wishers shouted slogans such as "Long live the Republic of China" and "Long live Representative Mo." The enthusiastic farewell sounds did not cease until the train had gone far. The Russian Director of the East Railway, Izmailov, and the representatives of the East Railway from a part of the Sino-Russian Conference, traveled with Mo on this day. Mo's second wife and eldest son also went along. It is said that his eldest son is going to study in Germany, so he specially hired a protector to accompany him. Before Mo left the country, his first wife, Ms. Fu, suddenly died of illness at 5:00 AM on the 29th. It was not until this morning that she was given a grand burial and taken to the Jile Temple for temporary placement. The news of the funeral was kept secret and not announced, probably because it was feared that condolences from the outside world would interfere with the schedule.</p>

<p>▲Ma Fuxiang and the New Provincial Committee Take the Oath of Office</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Ma Fuxiang, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, has been appointed to the position for two months. Recently, due to the rise of bandits in various counties in northern and southern Anhui, and the shortage of rice, rice-snatching riots have occurred. Cheng Tianfang, the Acting Chairman of the Provincial Government, and various parties have repeatedly telegraphed urging him to come to Anhui as soon as possible to preside over the provincial government. Mr. Ma then decided to come to Anhui from Nanjing on the 3rd and arrived in Anqing on the morning of the 4th. All sectors received the news in advance and immediately set up彩花牌樓 decorated arches at the Merchants' Wharf and posted welcome slogans everywhere. When Ma arrived in Anqing, the engineering battalion of the 15th Route 64th Division, the 1st Regiment of the Independent 15th Brigade, and the Provincial Public Security Brigade and Public Security Bureau Security Team were all waiting on the riverbank. Additional posts were temporarily added along the way for security. Representatives of Party and government agencies also came to welcome him. Those who came with Ma included Ke Xinge, the Central Oath-Taking Commissioner, and the new provincial committee members Ma Jidi, Li Yingsheng, Sun Shengwu, Zhang Keyao, and Jin Weiji. After landing, Ma briefly socialized with the welcomers and then rode a rickshaw into the city to rest at the Provincial Government. Then, he announced that the swearing-in ceremony would be held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. At that time, representatives of various agencies and groups gathered in the auditorium of the Provincial Government. Ma and the old and new provincial committee members arrived in turn, and the ceremony was performed as originally planned. Next, Central Oath-Taking Commissioner Ke Xinge delivered a speech on behalf of the Central Government, giving much encouragement. Next, Cao Minghuan of the Provincial Executive Committee, Lu Zaoshi of the Municipal Executive Committee, and Zeng Youhao, President of the High Court, delivered speeches in succession. Then, Mr. Ma gave a reply, briefly mentioning a few words. Then, an official read Mr. Ma's inaugural declaration, which was more than a thousand words long and divided into the following points: (1) Suppressing bandits: The banditry in various counties has not been quelled, and the people are robbing each other day and night. The primary strategy for treating the symptoms is to maintain law and order. The provincial government should plan to rectify and expand the provincial defense forces, and strictly order the county governments to uniformly command the local defense groups in each region to vigorously search and suppress them, so as to prevent them from spreading. At the same time, the household registration should be checked to strictly interrogate traitors and eliminate the source of bandits. (2) People's food: The relevant authorities should refer to the various relief measures that have been negotiated and be responsible for continuing to carry them out. At the same time, the county magistrates of each county should be ordered to investigate the actual amount of grain stored in their territory. In addition to leaving a reasonable amount for local people, they should try to persuade the depositors and neighboring counties in the province to circulate it as much as possible, and severely punish the unscrupulous people who privately restrict rice sales and crack down on merchants who raise prices and hoard goods. (3) Officialdom: Before the examination and selection laws are implemented, although there is no fixed standard for employing people, careful assessment should be made at the time of appointment, and close supervision should be carried out after use. If there is any abuse of power for personal gain or neglect of duty, they should be immediately dismissed and punished. (4) Finance: The provincial government should plan comprehensively to increase income and reduce expenditure, paying attention to both aspects. Or, first, in accordance with the Central Government's instructions to reduce government expenditures, consider the urgency and implement reductions. If it is still insufficient, then the Central Government should be requested to increase subsidies. Finally, Jin Weiji of the Provincial Committee gave a reply, and then a photograph was taken and the meeting was dismissed. (May 5th)</p>

<p>Shantou Correspondence: After Zhu Mao窜窜窜窜窜竄ed to Huichang, the situation on the Guangdong border suddenly became serious. Because the local Communists on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi took the opportunity to steal and occupy Sannan, Anyuan, Xunwu, and other places on the Jiangxi border. At the same time, Zhou Ziqun's rebel troops occupied eight places in Tingzhou, Fujian Province, and colluded with bandits to invade Shanghang and Wuping, which are very close to Pingyuan, Jiaoling, and Dapu on the Guangdong border. Fortunately, the 8th Brigade of the 61st Division, Mao Weishou's troops, were stationed in the upper reaches of the Han River. Mao's brigade has two regiments. The Zhang Zhiying Regiment, which came from Guangzhou, has arrived at Jiaoling, Songkou, Dapu, and other strategic points to garrison, digging trenches and building fortresses, and encircling dozens of miles of barbed wire, with a very tight defense. However, this morning (2nd), a telegram was received from Liang Ruogu, the Magistrate of Dapu County, stating that on the morning of the 30th of last month, more than a thousand Communist bandits from Yongding on the Fujian border attacked the county seat in separate routes. Liang and Battalion Commander Xu督督督督督督督隊 met the enemy. After fierce fighting until the time had passed, the bandits were defeated, and many ringleaders were captured alive, and dozens of prisoners were taken. It can be seen that the banditry in the upper reaches of the Han River may be slightly quelled. (May 2nd)</p>

If there are battalion commanders or higher stationed in the territory, the county magistrates should jointly be responsible for handling matters with the military and police officers. If there are only company commanders or platoon leaders or lower, they should temporarily be transferred to the county government for dispatch in order to specialize in authority. Matters are related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and all the army and police on land and water should obey the command and dispatch of the responsible officer and not have any boundaries, so as to protect merchants and maintain security.

<p>Rumors of Child Abduction: Refuting Misinformation: Recently, there have been rumors in Shanghai about child abduction for bridge sacrifices. Although there has been some spread in Songjiang, there has been no sign of panic. Unexpectedly, this afternoon (7th), before the primary schools in the city had finished their classes, the families of the students rushed to the schools to take their children back home. For a time, the atmosphere of terror was quite tense. The teachers of each school tried their best to refute the falsehood of the rumors, but they could not dispel the suspicions of the families, causing the primary schools to be greatly affected. The county's Party Affairs Rectification Committee specially issued a notice to dispel doubts and secretly investigate the rumor-mongers and punish them according to law.</p>

<p>A Record of the Court Hearing of the Extortion and Tearing Up of Ticket Case: Qian Fenghao, the assistant of Dingchang Silk Factory, had a two-year-old daughter who was robbed from his home in Xin'an Township and then blackmailed repeatedly. The main criminal in the case, Zhou Lanzhai, has been captured by the water police district in Shanghai and brought back to the county. Yesterday, Hearing Officer Yu Jitang summoned all the people involved, as well as Yu Xiangzhou, the representative of Yu Xiangting, the owner of the Guan Sheshan robbery case last year, and interrogated the main criminal Zhou Lanzhai in custody. First, Qian Fenghao detailed how he was robbed by bandits on the 8th of last month, how he received anonymous threatening letters, how he contacted Zhou Lanzhai one after another, how he was deceived of travel expenses, and how he revealed various flaws. Then, he submitted six letters as evidence. Then, Yu Xiangting stated that Yu Xiangzhou was his brother, who had not yet returned from Shanghai. The night before he was robbed, a short, fat man was wandering in front of the door, looking like Zhou Lanzhai. At first, he didn't think much of it, but later he realized that it was very important. Afterwards, according to rumors from the villagers, the case was done by Zhou Lanzhai. Finally, Zhou Lanzhai confessed that he was 39 years old, lived in Yangming Township, used to do foreign goods business in Shanghai, and is now the deputy township chief of the third district. He only admitted to defrauding money for use in this case, and the rest of the confession was vague. He was ordered to use a fountain pen to copy a copy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will and a page of the bandit's threatening letter so that the handwriting could be verified. After writing, he was ordered to be returned to custody.     The剧剧剧劇 Bandit Refuses Arrest and Is Killed: Ding Genda, a native of Jingtingsha, Kaiyuan Township, Xishan, was lowly and entered the bandit party at the age of twenty. However, he always committed crimes in other ports. Only in the last ten years did he return to Xishan to commit many crimes. He was captured by the government four times, but he escaped each time. Recently, he sneaked back home. After being reported, Lu Zhiguang, the chief of the ninth branch of the public security, led armed and live-fire police to arrest him. When they arrived, it was already dusk, and the gate of the Ding family was tightly closed. The police were sent to guard the front and back doors in groups. Ding happened to be inside and knew that something was wrong. He took a pistol and shot at the police guarding the door. The police returned fire after hearing the sound. After resisting for a long time, Ding Genda was shot in the right leg. He quickly crossed the neighboring house and fled into the mulberry field. Due to his injuries, he fell to the ground and died soon after. Chief Lu has reported to the county government and sent people to the countryside to verify.</p>

<p>The Establishment of the Cocoon Guild in Huzhou is Imminent: Although the silkworm reports from the four townships in Huzhou have been affected by continuous wind and rain and unfavorable weather temperatures, the silkworm sleep is still stable. The silkworm reports from the east, north, and south townships are excellent, resulting in an insufficient supply of mulberry leaves for silkworm consumption. On the 3rd, the price of mulberry leaves increased from two yuan to two yuan and five jiao. However, due to banditry in the west township, villagers do not dare to raise many silkworms, resulting in a surplus of mulberry leaves. Above Yangjiazhuang, the price of mulberry leaves is only one yuan and five jiao per dan, but no one dares to buy them despite the low price. It is reported that the provincial government has already appointed the director of the cocoon donation bureau in Huzhou: Wu, Zhou, and Ya; Luo Zhaoxuan in Changxing. The number of cocoon merchants in Huzhou is expected to increase compared to previous years, and they are expected to start weighing cocoons around the 20th.</p>

<p>Water Police Arrested Farmers for Causing Trouble: Dingpeng Township has a tradition of holding a god-worshiping ceremony on the fourth day of the fourth lunar month. This year, the ceremony was held as usual. The eighth squad of the Xitang water police learned of this and, fearing that bandits might infiltrate and cause trouble, dispatched five gunboats led by squad leaders Wang and Tang to suppress it. At that time, gambling stalls along the street fled upon hearing the news. The water police officers indiscriminately arrested people, taking Zhu Tingdong, a passerby, and more than a dozen farmers into the squad. Wang Langqin, a committee member, saw this and went forward to dissuade them, but was also arrested. Xu Daohua, a graduate of Huangpu Military Academy, went to intercede before they were released. Local people feel unfairly treated by the squad's illegal arrests and have appealed to the provincial government for investigation.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e87">The Ministry of Education Pays Attention to Overseas Chinese Education <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>▲Appealing Again for Overseas Chinese Education in Taiwan</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Japanese interference in overseas Chinese education in Taiwan, the Ministry of Education had previously consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the Japanese government, based on the petition submitted by representatives of Taiwanese public organizations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that it would wait for the establishment of a consulate to handle the matter. The Ministry of Education believed that this was not urgent and consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs again, stating that regarding the case of Japanese interference in overseas Chinese education in Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already replied to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Association that the establishment of a consulate had been scheduled for Taiwan and that it would be easier to handle the matter on-site after the consulate was established. The Ministry of Education considered that the number of overseas Chinese schools in Taiwan was limited and that it would be acceptable to wait for the establishment of a consulate before handling the matter on-site. However, the Ministry's intention was: (1) the local overseas Chinese publicly expressed their concerns about this case and traveled thousands of miles back to China to petition, indicating that the situation was very urgent. If it were to wait for the establishment of a consulate before handling the matter on-site, it was feared that it would be too late; (2) the governments of various British and Dutch colonies had interfered with overseas Chinese education, and the Chinese government had repeatedly ordered local consuls to negotiate earnestly with the governments of the places of residence, but all had failed to achieve satisfactory results. If the responsibility for handling this case were again assigned to the consuls, it was feared that it would still not produce results in the future; (3) there were thousands of overseas Chinese schools, and except for those in American territories, they were all under the pressure of powerful forces. Millions of overseas Chinese were hoping to restore freedom through Chinese sovereignty. If this case could be traded for victory, the impact would only be fortunate for a few overseas Chinese schools in Taiwan; (4) there were many schools established by Japanese expatriates in mainland China, and China did not interfere with them, while Japan interfered with Chinese schools in Taiwan, which violated the principle of equality and reciprocity. If Japan did not change its mind, China could follow suit. For the sake of the schools established by Japan, they would not insist on not allowing it. Based on the above reasons, it is proposed that the previous consultation be followed to emphasize education and suppress the expectations of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>▲Instructing to Maintain Overseas Chinese Education in the Philippines</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education instructed the Consul General stationed in the Philippines to work with the Philippine Overseas Chinese Education Association and the Chamber of Commerce to find ways to maintain the educational surcharge and to raise long-term funding for education. It stated that, according to the Philippine Chinese newspapers, some Chinese merchants in the area were not paying the educational surcharge on time, resulting in a shortfall of more than 40,000 yuan in the funds for March to May of this year, causing an economic panic in overseas Chinese education. The Board of Directors of the Overseas Chinese Education Association has now resolved three remedial measures: (1) From February to the end of May of this year, the monthly salaries of teachers and staff in each school will be reduced by 20%. The monthly salary of teachers and staff in public schools is more than 11,000 yuan, and a 20% reduction would be approximately 2,205 yuan, totaling 8,820 yuan for four months. (2) Students in each primary school will donate 2 yuan per student, and students in each middle school will donate 4 yuan per student, which is expected to raise approximately 5,000 yuan. (3) The Board of Directors of the Overseas Chinese Education Association will separately solicit special donations from the overseas Chinese community. The Ministry of Education considers that the overseas Chinese in the Philippines have always been enthusiastic about education, and the educational surcharge system they created is a model for overseas Chinese in other places. The central government is planning to issue a general order to overseas Chinese in various ports to emulate it. Recently, due to the existence of some hesitant donors, the donations have suddenly become scarce, which is a great concern. The measures proposed by the Overseas Chinese Education Association can alleviate the situation temporarily. However, the salaries of teachers and staff in overseas Chinese schools in the Philippines are not high to begin with. Reducing them further will make it difficult to maintain a livelihood. Students already bear a heavy burden by paying tuition fees annually, and collecting donations will be too much for the poor to bear. As for soliciting special donations, although there will be no shortage of generous people, it is not a long-term solution. Overseas Chinese education in the Philippines has a history of 30 years, and its relationship to the future of the overseas Chinese community is particularly important. In recent years, the overseas Chinese business has gradually declined, and the way to save it depends on education. The overseas Chinese business pays a small annual surcharge to maintain its glorious history and save its difficult future, which is worth doing. A small number of overseas Chinese businesses may occasionally err in their understanding of this meaning, trying to save a small amount of money without considering the long-term benefits, or it may be a temporary mistake. The consul, together with the directors of the Overseas Chinese Education Association and the various levels of the Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce, should earnestly persuade and guide them, so that those who have not paid will pay quickly, and those who do not pay will resume paying. The surcharge can be maintained, and education will not decline. If there is a long-term solution to increase funding, it should also be considered to supplement and remedy the situation and seek development. The overseas Chinese businesses in the Philippines are known for their public spirit, and it is hoped that they will all understand this meaning, work hard, and not be negligent.</p>

<p>Before Huang Jianzhong returned to Beijing, pamphlets and slogans of the Hubei Education Maintenance Association appeared in Wuchang, opposing Huang, claiming that he was a nationalist and a remnant of the March 18 massacre, colluding with Wu Mai in Ping to give speeches promoting nationalism. The provincial government had unanimously instructed the Public Security Bureau to investigate and ban them. When Chairman Chiang came to Wuhan this time, he heard about this matter, so in his speech at the welcome meeting of the Provincial Assembly, he also mentioned prohibiting student strikes and instructed the chairman of the Provincial Government, He Chengjun, to strictly crack down on them. Therefore, the provincial government yesterday ordered the Department of Education to instruct its subordinates to strictly prohibit anonymous attacks in pamphlets and slogans.</p>

<p>Baseball Game Postponed</p>
<p>▲ First Against America...Saturday</p>
<p>▲ Second Against Japan...Sunday</p>
<p>Since the Chinese baseball team, representing overseas Chinese in Honolulu, arrived in Shanghai, they have been practicing their skills at the Chinese baseball field for days. Many baseball enthusiasts from Japan and the United States in Shanghai have come to watch. According to experts, the strength of this Chinese baseball team is much stronger than before. The schedule of the competition in Shanghai has been changed. The first match against the United States, originally scheduled for today, has been postponed because the American team, seeing the Chinese team's prowess, even though they could select famous players from McKinsey, Spearsburg, and American expatriates in Shanghai to form a team, feared that a hastily assembled group would be a motley crew. Facing a formidable opponent, they dared not take it lightly and had to take some time to practice. Therefore, it was officially changed to Saturday for the competition. The second match, China against Japan, will be on Sunday.</p>

<p>To Endorse Chinese Passports</p>
<p>Requires a 500 Yuan Guarantee Before Endorsing</p>
<p>Our Country's Diplomatic Authorities Are Negotiating</p>
<p>The French Consulate General in Shanghai requires Chinese citizens applying for passports to France for business to pay a cash deposit of 500 yuan as a guarantee before endorsing the passport. For those traveling to countries such as Portugal and Belgium via France, a bank guarantee is also required for endorsement. Recently, it has been heard that the French Consulate General requires Chinese citizens applying for passports to France or traveling to countries such as Portugal and Belgium for business or travel to submit a deposit of 500 yuan per person before endorsing the passport. This measure violates international practice. Our country's diplomatic authorities have made informal inquiries to the French Consulate as to why this new regulation was not notified to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and demanded a change. Negotiations are currently underway.</p>

<p>Anti-British Movement by Indians</p>
<p>An Indian Detained for Distributing Leaflets</p>
<p>Wenhui Bao reported that this morning (7th), an Indian named Ye Jiaxin was charged in the British Police Court with spreading seditious writings. The defendant did not hire a lawyer. The police were represented by lawyer Winter, who claimed that at 0:15 this morning, Western policeman Hull noticed three Indians on Wusong Road holding leaflets and putting them into residents' houses. After observing for a while, he followed them secretly, hoping to persuade other policemen to capture all three. However, the Indians noticed and immediately ran away. He chased and caught one person, who is the defendant in this case. The leaflets were in English and stated, in brief, that Indians are no longer loyal subjects of the United Kingdom. Indians residing in Shanghai and its vicinity hereby declare that they are no longer British citizens. This is because the Indian government has created a political storm and an era of terror, forcing them to carry two hearts. Today, under the leadership of Gandhi in India, a policy of non-violent resistance is being vigorously implemented. It has now been extended to the Indians in Shanghai, who unanimously denounce the registration regulations of the British Consulate General and will no longer register, but will begin to adopt a policy of non-violent resistance. They earnestly hope that the Chinese government will consider the goodwill between the Chinese and Indian peoples, provide assistance, and show sympathy. The court immediately announced an adjournment for 14 days for continued hearing. The defendant was remanded in custody, and the police were ordered to arrest the other two Indians and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Understanding and Efforts to Commemorate the National Humiliation of May 9th <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>May 9th is the anniversary of the national humiliation fifteen years ago when Japanese imperialism, taking advantage of the heat of the European War, forced the then Beijing puppet government to sign the Twenty-One Demands, which could lead to national subjugation and extinction. The Twenty-One Demands included five items: first, to plunder the rights of transfer of ports, railways, mines, and leased territories that Germany had previously seized within Shandong; second, to actively annex Manchuria and Mongolia; third, to seize the right to dispose of the Hanyeping Company's assets and the right to mine nearby; fourth, to encompass all ports and islands along our coast; and fifth, to plunder important domestic affairs such as our national military, police, finance, transportation, and culture. The illegal proposal of the Twenty-One Demands and forced recognition have no basis in law. However, repeated requests to the Paris Peace Conference and the Washington Conference to adjudicate and cancel the demands have not been achieved, which shows that imperialists only know how to divide the spoils and do not know the truth. To avenge the national humiliation, we must endure hardship and strive for self-improvement. Yuan Shikai sought help from Japan to establish an imperial system, not hesitating to cede power and humiliate the country by signing the Twenty-One Demands. This time, the Yan-Feng rebel party also did not hesitate to collude with imperialism and betray the country for personal gain. Therefore, to commemorate the national humiliation of May 9th, we must support the central government, eliminate the rebels, and ensure that there are no more warlords who betray the country. For more than fifty years, Japan's aggression against China has become increasingly urgent. In recent years, it has been particularly active in managing Manchuria and Mongolia. To commemorate the national humiliation of May 9th, we must effectively abolish unequal treaties to remove their guarantee. We must vigorously promote the national goods movement to resist their economic aggression. We must actively develop manpower and financial resources towards Manchuria and Mongolia to eliminate their ambitions in the region.</p>
<p>Slogans: (1) The Twenty-One Demands are Japan's concrete plan to destroy China. (2) Yuan Shikai is the culprit who betrayed the Republic of China and forfeited national rights. (3) Only by eliminating domestic warlords can we overthrow all imperialism. (4) Only by vigorously promoting revolutionary construction can we abolish unequal treaties. (5) To commemorate May 9th, we must eliminate counter-revolutionary forces. (6) To commemorate May 9th, we must eliminate the remaining warlords who betrayed the country, Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang. (7) To commemorate May 9th, we must promote national goods and resist Japanese economic aggression. (8) To commemorate May 9th, we must support the central government and consolidate unity. (9) Down with Japanese imperialism! (10) Support the Chinese Kuomintang!</p>

<p>Minutes of the Second Standing Committee Meeting of the Fair Price Association</p>
<p>Fair Prices to Be Held from May 10th</p>
<p>The Municipal Rice and Grain Fair Price Committee held its second standing committee meeting the day before yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m. The attendees were Yao Zirang, Yan Xiaoquan, Wang Boxun, Wang Yiting, Tang Naikang (representing Xu Shaoxiu), Zhu Zixiang, Xu Fu (representing Xu Yang), Ye Huijun, Weng Yinchu, Huang Hanzhi, Sun Yishan, Yuan Liang (representing Shen Zengyuan), Mo Zijing, Qin Yanqi, Pan Gongzhan, Gu Xinyi, Lin Kanghou, and Lu Wenshao. The meeting was chaired by Committee Member Pan Gongzhan. The agenda included: (1) Chairman's report: (A) Quantity of rice to be determined. According to the procurement department, as of April 24th, a total of 1,500 bags of Jiaojiao rice in stock, 500 bags of Mindang rice, and 3,028 bags of Saigon No. 2 rice have been ordered, all priced at 15 yuan per stone. In addition, 500 bags of Mindang rice have been ordered at a price of 14 yuan and 95 cents per stone. The futures of 50,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice for May are 7 taels and 1 qian and 7 fen per dan, which is approximately 14 yuan and 93 cents per stone. (B) Matters concerning advance payments. The first batch of more than 5,000 bags of rice has been arranged by the chairman to be paid in advance by the General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Bank. As for the advance payment matters for subsequent shipments, it is proposed that Committee Members Xu, Lin, and Wang jointly discuss and form another banking group to handle them. (C) The Municipal Government's fair price rice funds have been submitted to the Mayor by the association, urging the Finance Bureau to allocate them in advance to facilitate the progress. (D) The Qianye Guild has nominated Mr. Wang Boxun as a member of the association and has submitted a request to the Mayor for additional appointment. (E) In order to reduce the cost of fair price rice, a letter has been sent to the Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, requesting that all import taxes and duties on fair price rice be exempted as an example. (2) Committee Member Ye Huijun reported that (A) the Commercial Association has convened a meeting yesterday to discuss the matter of soliciting donations. How to allocate the 30,000 yuan donation among various industries has not yet been decided, but in any case, the full amount should be raised. It is currently being actively carried out. (B) The Bean and Rice Guild has also convened a meeting of its members to discuss the issue of fair price rice sales. If the rice is sold at the purchase price of 15 yuan, it may not be in line with public opinion and will lose the meaning of fair price. It is best to sell it at 14 yuan, or at most 14 yuan and 50 cents. As for the deficit, if it is considered too large and cannot be raised, the guild may be able to add another 10,000 yuan on top of the previously recognized 10,000 yuan. (3) Committee Member Lu Wenshao reported that (A) the fair price rice is scheduled to be held on May 1st. At present, the deadline is approaching urgently. If it is held in all places at the same time, it may not be feasible in practice, or it may be held in a few places first. (B) The staff of each fair price point should be hired with funds to take responsibility. The salary is about 20 yuan per month with meals and about 30 yuan per month without meals. Matters for discussion: (A) Please discuss and decide on the date and price of the fair price rice. (Chairman's temporary motion) Resolved: (1) Date issue. Since the locations and equipment of each fair price point have not yet been arranged properly, it is too urgent to hold it on May 1st. It is resolved to postpone it for ten days and set the date for all points to open simultaneously on May 10th. (2) Price issue. Since the market price fluctuates greatly, a meeting should be convened again before the opening to decide. (B) The case of forming another banking group to handle the advance payment for the rice to be ordered (proposed by the chairman) was resolved. (1) Please invite the Municipal Bank to jointly organize an advance payment banking group with the silver and money industries, to be convened by Committee Member Xu. (2) Send a letter to large organizations as soon as possible, urging them to deliver the donations to the Municipal Bank immediately, and set May 5th as the deadline for raising the full amount of donations. (C) How to plan, supervise, and promote the fair price rice in rural areas (proposed by the chairman) was resolved. The Social Bureau should convene municipal council members from various districts for discussion and then determine the method. Committee Member Lu Wenshao is also invited to participate in the discussion at the meeting. (D) The proposal to change the appointment of Committee Member Sun Yishan as a member of the distribution department and request additional ratification (proposed by the chairman) was passed.

The legitimate loss of rice quantity during shipment and transportation shall not exceed one pound per bag. If there is an excess, the carrier shall be responsible. (4) Rice purchase coupons will be divided into two types, one sheng and five sheng. (5) Each household can purchase a maximum of five sheng of rice.

<h3 id="e125">The Ministry of Communications Rectifies Shanghai's Telephone System <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Adopts Suggestions from the Public Utilities Bureau</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, recognizing that telephones are a crucial municipal facility closely linked to the development of municipal industries, the maintenance of public safety, and the improvement of municipal transportation, and noting that there are many aspects of the city's telephone system that require rectification and improvement, previously drafted ten suggestions for rectification and submitted them to the Municipal Government for forwarding to the Ministry of Communications for review. As reported earlier, the Ministry has now responded to the Municipal Government, indicating its adoption of the suggestions put forward by the Public Utilities Bureau. A summary is provided below: (1) Regarding amending the business charter and expanding the scope of operations, the Ministry stated that the scope of telephone operations is determined by the development of the city. In rural areas outside the scope, fees should be determined by the distance of the line. However, the public may be unable to afford installation due to excessive fees. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau should be instructed to closely observe the development trends of the city at any time, consider expanding the scope of operations, and properly revise the fee regulations. (2) Regarding changing or canceling the charging method for Chinese-foreign calls, the Ministry stated that a call contract was signed between the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and Chinese-foreign companies in December 1925, and the charging method was clearly stipulated. Now that this contract is about to expire, the Bureau should be instructed to negotiate with the company to improve it as much as possible when renewing the contract. (3) Regarding the installation of public telephones, the Ministry believes that it is indeed essential and immediately instructs the Telephone Bureau to consider the situation and widely install them. (4) Regarding the recovery of the Songyang Telephone Company, the Ministry stated that it had previously instructed the Bureau to properly draft a recovery plan and should now urge it to proceed effectively. (5) Regarding the Pudong Branch, the Ministry has decided to establish it, and the required machinery and line materials have been ordered from the United States. The land has been purchased and is ready for the construction of the bureau building. (6) Regarding the widespread establishment of branch offices, it concerns technical and economic research and should be instructed to inform the Telephone Bureau of this for reference. The new West District Branch has now been fully installed and will soon be in operation. (7) Regarding the addition of relay lines, the relay lines between Nanshi and Zhabei were originally rented by the Telephone Bureau from Chinese-foreign companies. Now that they are insufficient, dozens of pairs have been added and are being negotiated. Regarding the relay lines between various bureaus and the concessions, the Bureau has been instructed to ascertain the required situation and consider increasing them. (8) Regarding the rectification of lines, the Ministry stated that although Shanghai's telephone lines are rectified from time to time, the occurrence of faults is still inevitable and should be strictly inspected by the Bureau to achieve perfection. (9) Regarding the recovery of Chinese and foreign telephones, the Ministry stated that it has instructed the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to prepare to lay lines for negotiation and should urge it to expedite the process. To restore sovereignty, it is planned to nationalize all Shanghai telephones, and efforts are being made to actively pursue this. (10) Regarding the banning and recovery of foreign telephone lines on both sides of roads built beyond boundaries, the Ministry agreed to instruct the Bureau to ascertain the number of households, ban and recover them. As mentioned above, the Ministry of Communications has strictly instructed the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, which is directly under its jurisdiction, to handle the improvement of Shanghai's telephone system item by item and effectively. The Bureau has the responsibility to refresh the telephone system and increase convenience and should strive to carry it out to live up to the expectations of the entire citizenry.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Request to Build New-Style Slaughterhouses <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Suggestions from the Commodity Inspection Bureau to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>The annual value of China's livestock products and by-products is about 200 million yuan. Recently, various countries have used the excuse that China's livestock has not been inspected before and after slaughter to ban imports, causing significant losses to domestic merchants. For example, the United Kingdom prohibits the import of Chinese lard, and the United States requires disinfection procedures upon entry for Chinese casings and prohibits the import of Chinese ham and sausages. All of these factors negatively impact Chinese livestock products and by-products in international trade. Although the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has now established inspection bureaus in important locations, it has not been able to fully achieve the goal of having the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries cancel these bans. The reason is that new-style slaughterhouses have not been established in various provinces and counties in China, making it impossible to provide effective proof of inspection before and after slaughter. From 1879 to 1891, the United States also faced similar pressure when exporting these products to Europe. Subsequently, the US government established a bureau for inspection, provided certification, built slaughterhouses in various states, and strictly implemented inspection before and after slaughter. European countries then lifted the bans one after another in 1891. China's current situation is very similar to that of the United States at that time. It may be possible to adopt its policies to adapt to the environment. The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau specifically requested the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on the 5th to consult the Ministry of Health and forward it to the special municipal governments and provincial governments with convenient transportation, first ordering the municipal and county governments along the railways to establish a relatively scaled new-style slaughterhouse in the city and county center within one year, implement inspection before and after slaughter, so that the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries will no longer have any excuses. It is also requested that the Ministry of Education be consulted and forwarded to various universities with agricultural colleges to cultivate veterinary talents to meet the needs. The bureau also stated that it has established a livestock product and by-product inspection office within the bureau. Within the scope of its work, in order to prepare for promoting the realization of this matter, it has specifically sent Wu Deming, a technician of the bureau, to Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Wukang, Songjiang, and other places to investigate whether slaughterhouses have been established and the number of livestock slaughtered daily in each county for reference.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Beloved Son Buried Alive by Enemy <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Thirteen-Year-Old Son Tragically Murdered</p>
<p>Nephew Went to Deliver a Message and Never Returned</p>
<p>Guan Liukun, a local resident, 43 years old, lives in Guan Lane, Tanzi Bay, and earns a living by growing vegetables. He has two children, a daughter who is 19 years old and unmarried, and a son, Mao Da, who is 13 years old and helps his father irrigate the garden. As the only son, Liukun loves him very much. At about 1 PM the day before yesterday, Mao Da went out alone, without saying where he was going. As evening approached, he had not returned home. His father became very suspicious and searched everywhere, but to no avail. Yesterday morning, Liukun ran to his sister, Hou Guanshi, but she had no clue either. It was not until about 3 PM that Hou Guanshi went to look at the wheat in the fields near the Yushi River near her residence. Suddenly, she saw a pile of soil next to the grave of her in-laws. She approached and saw that the ground had been dug up. She found it very strange and took a shovel to dig it up. About a foot into the soil, a child's foot suddenly appeared in the soil, wearing blue cloth-bottomed shoes, which seemed to be what her nephew wore. She was shocked. She immediately ordered her third son, Genbao, to report to her brother, Guan Liukun. However, Genbao did not return after a meal. Hou was impatient and went to Liukun's house to deliver the message herself. To her surprise, she learned that Genbao had not gone to notify him, which was very strange. Soon after, Guan Liukun reported to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau Police Station, and the patrol leader, together with the 22nd Picture Land Guardian Renxin, Guan Liukun, Hou Guanshi, and others went to the wheat field on the Yushi River next to the Hou family's grave to excavate. At a depth of about four feet, a corpse appeared. Guan Liukun recognized that it was his son, Mao Da. He mourned over the corpse and cried uncontrollably. The dead child was wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants, floral socks, and blue cloth shoes. His head and face were swollen and purplish-red, likely due to being buried alive. After thinking about it, Guan Liukun felt that his nephew Genbao was suspected of having gone to deliver the message on his sister's order but never returned. Therefore, the police took Hou into custody at the Fourth District Public Security Bureau for questioning. Hou is 63 years old, lives in Houjia Gate, and has three sons: the eldest, Aibi; the second, Er'a; and the youngest, Genbao, who is on the run. However, Hou said to others that there was no old feud between the two families. If her son was the murderer in this case, it was difficult to understand why he would be so cruel.</p>

<p>Master Yang Tries a Case</p>
<p>Dispute Arises from Property Division and Loss of Deeds</p>
<p>Woman Forced to Go to the Xiao Wang Temple</p>
<p>Whipped and Covered in Scars</p>
<p>Master Yang Also Imprisoned</p>
<p>In Zhoujia Bridge, about three miles west of Gaohang Town, Pudong, there is a farmer named Shen Hailin. The four brothers were dividing their property at home a few days ago when four field deeds disappeared. His elder brother, Shilin, strongly accused Hailin's wife, Xi Shi, of stealing them. Since she did not steal them, she firmly denied it. Shilin claimed that he had his own way. At about 11 PM that night, Hailin's wife was doing embroidery when Shilin suddenly broke into the door and said that if she did not steal the field deeds, she should go to the Xiao Wang Temple to swear before Master Yang. The woman had no choice but to go with him. When they arrived at the temple, two figures resembling yamen runners suddenly appeared and put iron chains around her neck without asking any questions. They forcibly dragged her into the temple. The monks in the temple heard the noise and came out to look, but they were driven into a small room behind the hall by these people. They ordered the woman to kneel before a man who claimed to be Master Yang. At this time, the woman knew that they were impostors, so she was not afraid. The man claiming to be Master Yang sat majestically in the hall, like a judge, insisting that the woman confess and ordering the fake yamen runners to whip her. Although the woman was covered in scars, she still firmly denied it. Seeing that their plan had failed, the group left in a clamor. The next day, the woman sued the Fifth Precinct of the Third District. As a result, the so-called Master Yang was imprisoned. After strict interrogation by the precinct, it was learned that Shilin was the mastermind. The criminals were then sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Asking Older Sister for Help</p>
<p>Female Worker Encountered Robbers in Desolate Place</p>
<p>Gold Ring, Gold Bracelet, and Gold Buttons Stolen</p>
<p>Security Guard Injured While Capturing Robbers</p>
<p>One Robber Shot and Captured</p>
<p>Jin Genmei, a local woman, 20 years old, who used to work as a female worker in a yarn factory and lives near the Qinshi Yangdian in Pudong, was passing through Taiping Bridge, south of the Qichang Stockade, in Pudong the day before yesterday afternoon. The place was very desolate. Suddenly, two robbers emerged from under the bridge, one holding a sharp axe and the other holding a sharp knife, blocking her path. They said to Genmei, "Older sister, recently, the brothers have been very embarrassed, please help us." After saying this, they raised their axes and knives to scare her. Seeing this, Genmei looked around for help, but there was no one to help her. She was robbed of a gold ring, a gold bracelet, and a gold button. After robbing her, they fled. Genmei immediately called for help. Yao Changsheng, a plainclothes security guard of the Third Team of the Qichang Stockade, happened to pass by and came running after hearing the call. Seeing the two robbers running away, he chased after them. The robber with the knife was slow in running, so he was caught by the security guard. The robber immediately turned around and stabbed the security guard in the face with the knife, piercing both cheeks and causing blood to gush out. After being injured, the security guard immediately drew his pistol and fired three shots. Two bullets missed, but the third bullet hit the robber's leg. He was injured and fell to the ground. At this time, more security guards came running after hearing the alarm and captured the injured robber. He was taken to the team. Since the injured security guard's injuries were quite severe, he was immediately sent to the Pudong Hospital for treatment. The captured robber confessed that his name was Fu Genfa, 21 years old, from Pudong, living at 34 Qichang Stockade. He had previously committed a crime in the public concession and was imprisoned for two years and six months. He was released in April of this year. His accomplice, Lu Jinquan, lived at 33 Qichang Stockade. According to the confession, the team sent more security guards to arrest Lu at his address, where he was captured under the bed in his bedroom. He confessed that he was 27 years old, a local resident, and had robbed Zhang Qigen, a security guard from Zhangjia Building, of a woolen overcoat, a watch, and four pairs of shoes in the same place last Friday afternoon. Later, he met a person in the same place, who had no valuables, so he only took a top hat and pawned it at a pawnshop in Yangshupu for one yuan. The team then took the stolen goods from the robbery of Zhang Qigen from Lu's house and checked them. Only one shoe was missing. That night, the two robbers were escorted to the Third District Police Station. After questioning by the district chief, they were sent to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Woman Suspected and Took Poison</p>
<p>Usually, They Were Very Affectionate</p>
<p>One Day, a Big Argument Erupted</p>
<p>Liu Could Not Defend Himself</p>
<p>Taking Poison, Life in Danger</p>
<p>Liang Jiazhen, a Cantonese woman, 28 years old, living at 1633 Taoyuanfang, North Henan Road, because her lover, Liu, had not returned home for many days, suspected that he was having an affair. Yesterday morning, they had a disagreement, which led to her swallowing tranquilizer in an attempt to end her life. Her breath was weak, and her life was in danger. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Fallen into the Pits of Pleasure</p>
<p>Jiazhen was very intelligent as a child. She studied in school in her hometown for several years, so she can understand ordinary words. Later, her parents died, and the family's situation deteriorated. She was brought to Shanghai by someone and entered the world of pleasure, making a living by selling laughter. Because of her beauty and gentleness, many young masters were happy to associate with her. There were many who fell at her feet.</p>
<p>Married to a Desirable Man</p>
<p>Four years ago, she met Liu, a fellow villager. Liu is now employed at Juchanghe Food Store on North Sichuan Road. He is a young and dashing, handsome young man. They fell in love and soon made a lifelong agreement. After leaving the pits of pleasure, they built a love nest in a building at 1633 Taoyuanfang, North Henan Road. They were like a loving couple. For several years, they lived in peace.</p>
<p>Mother and Wife Came to Shanghai</p>
<p>However, Liu's hometown still has parents and a wife. After several years, he returned home to visit his relatives. Although letters were often exchanged, the elders longed for him. Last month, Liu's mother and wife came to Shanghai by boat and stayed at the Wan Hotel. The family was reunited, and they were very happy.</p>
<p>Mother Sick in the Hotel</p>
<p>Soon after, Liu's mother fell ill in the hotel due to acclimatization. Liu was naturally filial. In addition to going to work during the day, he returned to hire a doctor to treat her and take care of her, day and night. For a week, he did not take off his clothes. In the past two days, Liu's mother's illness has improved.</p>
<p>Tranquilizer</p>
<p>Because of this, Liu had not been to Liang's place for ten days. The night before, he returned home alone. After Liang met him, she vented her anger, saying that he had not returned for many days and must have a lover outside. Although Liu repeatedly explained the cause, Jiazhen did not understand. The argument continued all night. The next morning, at about 8 AM, Liu was about to go to work when he was stopped by Liang. A quarrel broke out, and it continued until about 11 AM. Liang took out a bottle of tranquilizer from the drawer and slowly swallowed it in front of Liu. At the time, Liu was angry and did not stop her. Suddenly, he saw Jiazhen's face turn pale, and she began to moan. He quickly sent her to Tongren Hospital for treatment by car. According to the doctor, she had taken too much poison, and her life was in danger.</p>

She was restless, and the maid found out and immediately told her mother. She reported to the Old Gate Patrol Room, which sent Detective Zhang Yi to investigate Wang's home. He saw Jinyuan lying on a brass bed, staring blankly. He realized that she had taken a lot of poison. She was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment in a detective car. The doctor said that Jinyuan was weak and the poison was severe, so she could not be saved. She died in the hospital at 9 AM yesterday. The hospital will report to the court today to examine the body at the Felun Road Morgue and question the family. It is said that before taking the poison, there were no arguments.

<p>Cai A'si Requests Divorce from Husband</p>
<p>Unable to Bear Oppression from Husband</p>
<p>The Women's Association Promises Assistance</p>
<p>Cai A'si, a member of the sixth branch of the Shanghai Women's Association, stated that her husband, Liu Weiguang, also known as Maosheng, was licentious all day long, never returned home, abandoned his wife, and left the family without food. Occasionally, when he did come home, he would be hostile and pick quarrels with her, subjecting her to poisonous beatings and violent attacks, leaving her covered in bruises. She was willing to work to support herself, but Liu slandered and prevented her with unreasonable words. Now that Cai is being beaten and insulted by her husband and has no means of living, she cannot bear the various oppressions and submitted a request to the Municipal Women's Association on the fourth of this month, seeking assistance to divorce Liu Weiguang. The association accepted the case and allowed Cai A'si to temporarily stay in the association for food and lodging while the matter is being handled and resolved.</p>

<p>Regarding the Bail of Local Bully Liu Junfu</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee sent a letter to the Shanghai Local Court yesterday, stating: "Regarding the case of Liu Junfu, a local bully from the Hua Jing Township of the Second District of Shanghai County, who was previously reported by the Second District Executive Committee for extorting the villager Chen Xinci, which was verified by our committee's investigation and referred to the county government for the detention of the said local bully to be punished according to law, it has been many days without a reply. We have now learned that the said local bully has been released on bail midway, causing strong indignation among the local citizens, who have repeatedly petitioned our committee for strict action. Therefore, we hereby send this letter to your esteemed court, requesting that the said local bully be promptly brought to justice to uphold the law, and that the details of the bail and the results of the handling be reported to our committee.

<h3 id="e141">Special District Local Court <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>First Investigative Hearing</p>
<p>Zheng Xiaobao and Tang Meiquan from Wuxi broke into room 129 of the Huizhong Hotel on Hankou Road at 11:30 pm on March 9, robbing Chen Yeqiao and others of $240 in cash, and fled with the stolen goods. Chen immediately gave chase and apprehended Tang Meiquan. Although Zheng Xiaobao was blocked by the police who were alerted, he continued to flee. The police fired a shot, wounding his foot, and he was captured. The next morning, they were sent to the former Provisional Court, where the police department filed charges of robbery. However, Zheng and Tang claimed it was due to a gambling dispute. On the same day, Changren Ji Geng brought a set of dominoes and a dice shaker to testify, stating that he visited Zheng Xiaobao that night and saw them fighting. The room contained a set of dominoes and dice, which he took and gave to Zheng's mother to prove that the dispute arose from gambling. However, the plaintiff, Chen Yeqiao, insisted that this was not the case. The hotel tea servant was also summoned to testify that there were no gambling tools in room 229, and he had not seen Zhou at the hotel that night. The presiding judge, Sun Yuan, determined that Zheng and Tang were guilty of robbery and sentenced them to three years and six months of imprisonment. The witness Zhou Jigeng was handed over to the police for investigation into whether his testimony was false. Subsequently, on April 1, the Provisional Court was reorganized into the Special District Local Court. The internal organization of the court was different from before, so the police department requested the Special District Local Court to interrogate Zhou. The presiding judge then re-referred the case to the Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Chief Prosecutor Zhou Xianjue assigned Prosecutor Guo Huaipu to handle the case. Prosecutor Guo then gathered the case files, began to proceed, and specially opened an investigative hearing yesterday afternoon, summoning the plaintiffs Chen Yeqiao and Chen Gennian, father and son, and the Huizhong tea servant and the Chinese police who made the arrest to court. Zhou Jigeng was brought to the court for questioning. At the end of the investigation, it was determined that Zhou Jigeng was suspected of perjury, and he was ordered to remain in custody while the others were dismissed, awaiting indictment. Since the establishment of the Special District Local Court, although a Prosecutor's Office has also been set up, it is restricted by the agreement, and the prosecutors have not been able to fully exercise their duties. Therefore, although it has been more than a month since its establishment, this is the first case in which a prosecutor has independently opened a hearing to investigate and preliminarily try a case.</p>

<p>Two Children Rescued</p>
<p>The trafficker Cai Chen, a 39-year-old woman from Changxing, Zhejiang, recently lured two boys to Shanghai and boarded the Xiamen-bound Jinan steamer yesterday morning around 5:00 am, intending to sell them in Xiamen. As the ship was about to set sail, two investigators from the Women and Children Relief Association boarded the ship to inspect. When they questioned Cai, her answers were incoherent and untrue. They took Cai and the two children to the water police station. According to Cai, one of the boys was Cai Baosheng from Shaoxing, 12 years old, and the other was Xu Guisheng from Pengjiaqiao, 9 years old. She admitted that Cai was her son and was going to live in Xiamen. According to the two boys, one was Zhao Guisheng from Hunan and the other was Zhang Liansheng from Huzhou, which completely contradicted Cai's statements regarding their names and origins. As the case involved the inhuman trafficking of children for export, they were sent to the Local Court yesterday afternoon for disposition.</p>

<p>Shi Zhengcai Reports to District Investigation</p>
<p>Hengyi Inn Accountant Obstructs</p>
<p>Shoes and Clothes Under the Bed</p>
<p>Talking and Laughing in Room 18</p>
<p>The First District Headquarters in Nanshi received a report from Shi Zhengcai, a 31-year-old from Haimen, who works as a partner in a cigarette paper shop in the French Concession. He said that he received a letter from his family stating that his sister, Shi Youxian, had been lured to Shanghai by her sister, Han Shi, and her brother-in-law, Han Huaiyi, and hidden without a trace, with the intention of selling her. He was asked to find her in Shanghai. He and his relative Shi Jianglang carefully searched and learned that they were hiding in the Hengyi Inn at No. 29 Yanmatou Lane, 16th Shop, under his jurisdiction. He requested that the police be sent to arrest them. The request was approved, and detectives Dong Mingde, Yuan Haishan, Yu Maolong, etc., went to arrest them at around 6:00 pm. They inspected the guest register of the inn and found that they were staying in Room 13. They went to check the room, but no one was inside when they pushed open the door. They asked the inn servant, who said that the guests had gone out today. They further questioned Chen Jixun, the accountant from Haimen, who also said that they were not there. Suspecting that they were being evasive, they thoroughly searched the room and found shoes and clothes under the bed. They then asked the tea servant why there were these items in the room if there were no guests staying there. The tea servant remained silent. Suspecting even more, they searched all the rooms and found Han Huaiyi, his wife Shi, and her younger sister Shi Youxian sitting on the bed talking and laughing in Room 18. They were immediately arrested. The inn was accused of harboring and concealing the kidnapping of witnesses, and obstructing the investigation when the incident was discovered. Chen Jixun, the inn's accountant, was also brought back to the district for preliminary review by District Chief Chen, as he was clearly involved in the case.</p>

<p>Robbed in Lujiazui</p>
<p>Tang Shigen's Pudong boat was loaded with flour, soybean oil, and other goods from Dingshun and other shops, as well as more than a dozen male and female passengers, and set sail for Xinchang yesterday. The tide rose in the afternoon, and it set anchor. Around 7:00 pm, it sailed near Lujiazui. It was already dark, and two small boats sailed head-on. Tang, fearing a collision, steered to avoid them. Unexpectedly, the two boats surrounded the boat from the left and right, shining electric torches. They asked Tang where he was going. Tang, not suspecting thieves, replied that he was carrying passengers and goods. The thieves swarmed onto the boat, wielding iron rods or large knives, and rushed into the cabin, threatening the passengers and preventing them from making noise. They searched everyone, and none of the male or female passengers were spared. All the silver dollars were robbed. They then searched the stern of the boat, robbing Tang's leather box, which contained two hundred dollars in entrusted money and freight bills from various merchants. Before leaving, they smashed the rudder of Tang's boat, fearing that they would be followed, making it impossible for him to sail. When searching the passengers, a certain Ju, who was carrying boiling water, resisted and was stabbed in the arm. Tang hired a boat to unload the goods and sailed away after repairing the boat.</p>

The carriage was detached at Chang'an Station, unloaded, and reloaded onto another train to Shanghai. Therefore, the freight train arrived at the Shanghai station behind schedule.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Young Woman Accuses Husband <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Of Bigamy and Abandonment</p>
<p>Wu Fuzhen, a young woman, recently filed a complaint with the Prosecutor's Office of the Local Court, accusing her husband Gao Jinshen of bigamy and abandonment. Her statement was as follows: On the tenth day of the tenth month of last year, she married Gao Jinshen, a partner in the Jushun Bean and Wheat Shop on Doushi Street, South Shanghai, with Chen Jiaxin and Jian Yi as matchmakers. The wedding was held at the China Hotel on Second Road. They immediately began to live together. Now, the defendant has abandoned her, and it has been discovered that the defendant is originally from Jiading and has a wife named Wu. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit for bigamy, requesting legal action. The court ordered Gao to be brought to court for questioning and detention, as the defendant had committed the crime under Article 254 of the Criminal Law. The public prosecution was filed. Yesterday morning, the Criminal Court, presided over by Shen Bingrong, specially opened the first court for trial. The plaintiff was absent. The defendant, Shang Jinshen, testified that Wu Fuzhen was introduced as a concubine by Chen Jiaxin last year, and that he still had a second wife, Wu, at home. At this point, the defendant's lawyer, Ye Fukan, rose and said that the defendant's wife, Gao Wu, was present in the gallery and requested that the court summon her to clarify the truth. Judge Shen then ordered Gao Wu to leave the gallery and asked the defendant, "Since you said you were taking a concubine, do you have any written evidence?" He replied, "Yes, but they stole it." He asked, "Was the wedding held at the China Hotel?" He replied, "There was no wedding. Moreover, Wu Fuzhen and the matchmakers came to the hotel by rickshaw." He asked, "Was the hall rented?" He replied, "No." He asked, "Which room was it?" He replied, "I don't remember, about a dozen." He asked, "Was a banquet prepared?" He replied, "No, please investigate." Judge Shen obtained the testimony and then ordered Gao Wu to the case to testify. She was 25 years old, from Luodian, and lived at Shenjiaqiao, north of Luodian. "Gao Jinshen is my husband. I have been married for three years as his second wife." He asked, "Have you had any children?" She replied, "I have a hidden illness and cannot have children, so I told my husband to take a concubine." He asked, "Was the wedding held in the hotel?" She replied, "I was tricked." He asked, "When your husband came home, did he tell you about marrying Wu?" She replied, "He (referring to Gao Jinshen) didn't tell me." Judge Shen said, "Then your husband hid it from you?" She replied, "I told him to marry her. I told him to live with me, but she refused." The judge obtained the testimony. As the plaintiff was not present, the case still needed to be investigated. He ordered that no debate be held and that another date be set for further review and decision. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

The police arrested Li and the stolen goods and took him to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the French court for investigation. The plaintiff first complained about the previous situation. Li A'da admitted that he was poor and had no choice but to steal. The French official sentenced Li to seven days of imprisonment as a warning, and the stolen goods were returned to the plaintiff.</p>

<p>Sent Back to His Hometown After Recovery</p>
<p>Zhang Zhiyuan from Hangzhou was fired from his job because of his gambling addiction. He and his beloved prostitute, Zhang Jinbao, temporarily resided in room 30 of the Xin Su Hotel on Fuzhou Road. The previous evening, they bought opium and both took poison. The next morning, the tea servant discovered them and sent them to the hospital. Jinbao took more poison and died shortly after. The case was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The police in charge have taken the body to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Guo, a judge from the Special District Local Court, was appointed to inspect the body at the office. The public case was announced, and the Western police chief reported the results of the investigation after the incident, stating that Zhang lost his job and continued to gamble. The last gambling money of fifty dollars was moved by Jinbao for him, but he still lost. Zhang felt ashamed and took poison. Fortunately, he was still curable. It was requested that Zhang be sent back to his hometown after he recovered, as he was afraid that he would commit suicide again in Shanghai. As for the deceased Zhang Jinbao, no relatives were found. The Prosecutor ordered that Zhang Jinbao's body be handed over to Pushan Mountain Villa for collection. This prostitute can be said to have been single-minded. Unfortunately, she did not have discerning eyes and could not find a promising person in the world of prostitution to devote herself to.</p>

After the family prepared the coffin, the police station, believing that the deceased did not die from injuries, but that Shen Zixiang's act of injury could not be avoided, transferred Shen to the Local Court yesterday for punishment.</p>

<p>Regulations for Protecting the Cocoon Market</p>
<p>The General Silk Cocoon Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, considering the unrest in various regions, has drafted regulations for the protection of the cocoon market. These regulations have been submitted to the National Government and the provincial governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui for implementation. The submitted documents were previously reported. Now, the regulations for protecting the cocoon market are transcribed below:</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province (1) In all counties where cocoon businesses are located, the protection period is as follows: From May 20th to July 20th of the national calendar, a total of sixty days. This is the period for which cocoon merchants throughout the province request protection. The transportation of cash and cocoons depends entirely on the stationed troops, naval and land police in each area to provide appropriate protection at all times. If cocoon industry associations, cocoon directors, cocoon merchants, and Chinese and foreign merchants who come to buy cocoons need to request assistance from the military, public security bureaus, and county governments in these areas, it is requested that orders be issued to allow them to do so, so that officials and merchants can communicate without hindrance. (2) Protection matters are divided into five sections: (Section 1) The Dongting East and West Mountains of Wu County have traditionally transported cash from Shanghai by train to Suzhou. It is requested that four police patrol boats be dispatched to Suzhou Railway Station to wait for the arrival of cocoon merchants' cash and escort it, starting from May 20th. This will take about twenty days, ensuring the completion of transportation. For the subsequent twenty days, when dried cocoons are transported to Suzhou, they will be handed over in Suzhou or transported to other locations by train or boat for delivery. It is requested that protection be provided at all times. (Section 2) From May 20th to June 20th, these thirty days are the period for cocoon merchants in various counties, cities, towns, and villages to transport cash. At Suzhou, Wuxi, Henglin, Changzhou, Danyang, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and Songjiang, Jinshan, Fengjing stations, as well as Changshu, Jiangyin, Jingjiang, Nantong, Haimen, Wujiang, and Pingwang ports, cash will be loaded and unloaded. It is requested that military and police be dispatched to take care of these locations. Where there are no military or police, county governments should assign guards to defend the stations and ports to prevent negligence. (Section 3) In cities, towns, and villages in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, Danyang, Yixing, Liyang, Jintan, Songjiang, Jinshan, Changshu, Jiangyin, Jingjiang, Nantong, Haimen, and other places, where banks and money shops are located during the cocoon market season, there will inevitably be cash inflows and outflows. It is requested that orders be given to the stationed troops, naval and land police, and county governments to maintain strict vigilance day and night. (Section 4) Wujiang and Wu counties are adjacent to Taihu Lake, and the areas along the way are critical. Chinese and foreign merchants travel by boat to the interior, passing through these areas day and night. It is requested that the naval and land military and police in these areas be notified in advance to provide protection at all times, and four police patrol boats be dispatched to patrol these areas from May 20th to June 20th, a period of thirty days. (Section 5) Police patrol boats are the most convenient. Historically, Chinese and foreign cocoon merchants have been able to follow behind the boats with their funds, which has been very helpful. This year, it is requested that the Chief of the Public Security Bureau inform the chiefs of each district bureau to instruct the patrol boats to select personnel suitable for the location and familiar with the situation and assign them nearby, starting from (May 20th). The allocations are as follows: 32 boats to the Huangpodun Wuxi Cocoon Industry Association, 20 boats to the Changzhou Wujin Cocoon Industry Association, 20 boats to the Daqinghong Jiangyin Cocoon Industry Association, 24 boats to the Xushezhen Yi Li Jin Cocoon Industry Association, 10 boats to the Fengjingzhen Song Jin Cocoon Industry Association, 4 boats to the Pingwangzhen Wujiang Cocoon Industry Association, and 10 boats to the Mudu Zhen Wu County Cocoon Industry Association. (Please consider allocating two boats nearby to be stationed in Guangfu Town.) The total number of police patrol boats is 120, which will be sent to each area to consult with the cocoon industry association and cocoon directors, and be stationed in various villages. Traditionally, cash has been transported from Shanghai to Wuxi and Changzhou stations, where it is unloaded and distributed to various counties via waterways. It is requested that each patrol boat escort the shipment to the villages for greater safety. Now, it is requested that the Chief of the Public Security Bureau select personnel suitable for the location and assign them nearby to understand the local situation and avoid unnecessary travel. Since the war, there have been many bandits in various places, and this year's cocoon market is unlike previous years. Only by requesting protection from local military and police through local cocoon directors and merchants can this be ensured. It is requested that this be communicated as well. (3) County governments and local military and police have always provided exceptional assistance in protecting cocoon merchants. This year is unlike previous years. It is requested that the magistrates of the cocoon-producing counties and the military and police be notified that from May 20th to July 20th, during these sixty days, when Chinese and foreign merchants come to the interior to purchase fresh cocoons, they should carefully protect the flow of money and goods, the transportation routes, and the locations where cocoon businesses store their funds. Chinese and foreign merchants will be deeply grateful. (4) Cocoon industry associations have been established in the cocoon-producing areas of various counties, with directors elected. In case of urgent public matters, they can consult with the county magistrate and military and police officers for handling. It is requested that consideration be given to the fact that fresh cocoons are only available for a few days, and there should be no delay in implementation. In a few places where associations have not yet been established, cocoon merchants who open cocoon businesses can directly apply to the Public Security Bureau and county government for protection. It is requested that a uniform order be issued for implementation. (5) In remote areas where there are no stationed troops or police, it is requested that the county government dispatch nearby military and police to protect them, or request the dispatch of police patrol boats to be stationed in key locations, to avoid being caught off guard and encountering danger. (6) During the cocoon market, goods have different qualities and prices fluctuate. Buying and selling are based on mutual agreement, and forced buying and selling are prohibited. If anyone uses cocoon sales as a pretext to gather a large number of people and forcibly buy cocoons at the cocoon businesses, it is requested that county magistrates be ordered to prohibit such actions and dispatch county police to be stationed in the cocoon businesses to strictly prevent disturbances by peddlers and local thugs in order to prevent incidents. The above items are submitted for implementation according to established practice. Any incomplete matters should be prepared by the cocoon industry associations of each county in a timely manner. In remote areas where associations have not been established, cocoon merchants can promptly request local officials to investigate and handle the matter to ensure thoroughness.

<p>Zhejiang Province (1) The most important thing for protecting Chinese and foreign cocoon merchants who come to the area to buy cocoons is cash. The routes and locations for transporting cash are listed below: Shaoxing, Shengxian, Xinchang, Shangyu, and other counties transport cash from Shanghai to Ningbo, where they change trains and transport it to Baiguan Town, Zhuji, and Xiaoshan. The above is transported from Hangzhou. Or, Shaoxing transports it to Yuyao, Cixi, and Fenghua. The above is transported from Ningbo. Yinxian, Hangxian, Linping, Haining, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pinghu, Chongde, and Haiyan are transported from Shanghai. Or, it is transported from Hangzhou. Wuxing, Changxing, Anji, Wukang, Deqing, Xiaofeng, and other counties are transported from Huzhou or Hangzhou. (2) Protection period: Shaoxing, southwest villages of Shengxian, Shangyu, Zhuji, Xiaoshan, Hangxian, Linping, Haining, Yuhang, Xindeng, Fuyang, Changhua, Yuqian, Tonglu, Fenshui, Xinchang, northeast villages of Shengxian, Yuyao, Fenghua, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pinghu, Chongde, Haiyan, Wuxing, Changxing, Anji, Wukang, Deqing, Xiaofeng, Yinxian, Cixi, and other counties: From May 5th to June 20th of the national calendar is the period for transporting cash. The packaging and transportation of dried cocoons to factories generally take place from May 10th to June 15th. This is the period for which cocoon merchants throughout the province request protection. It is requested that county governments, naval and land troops, and public security bureaus be instructed to provide appropriate protection at all times. (3) Protection matters are divided into four sections: (Section 1) Cocoon merchants transport cash from Shanghai to Ningbo, Yinxian, Cixi, and Fenghua, and then transfer it from Ningbo by train to Baiguan Town, where they unload and hire civilian boats to transport it to Shengxian, Xinchang, Shangyu, Shaoxing, and other counties. Cocoon businesses are located along the way in Zhangjiabu and Sanjie, where they unload. It is requested that the Ningbo local military and police be instructed to maintain order at the ports and stations and provide proper escort during unloading, loading, and along the way. From Baiguan Town, boats are hired to transport it to Zhangjiabu, Sanjie, Shengxian, and other places. Cocoon merchants should go to the military commander in the town to request that troops be dispatched for escort. It is also requested that the commander of the troops in the area be instructed to approve and implement any requests for protection from cocoon merchants immediately. (Section 2) Cocoon merchants transport cash from Shanghai to Hangzhou and then distribute it from Hangzhou to Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Tonglu, Fenshui, Fuyang, Changhua, Yuqian, Xindeng, Yuhang, Haining, Haiyan, Linping, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pinghu, Chongde, Wuxing, Changxing, Anji, Wukang, Deqing, and Xiaofeng counties. It is requested that troops be assigned to be stationed in each county and that military and police in and out of the provincial capital's stations, Zhakou, and Gongchen Bridge and other ports work together to provide protection at all times. It is also requested that each battalion and bureau be instructed to approve requests from cocoon merchants for troops to escort them along the way and to return to camp to cancel their duties immediately after delivery. The travel expenses should be paid by the cocoon merchants to avoid delays caused by temporary applications for approval and dispatch. (Section 3) This year, cocoon funds for the Shaoxing area will first be gathered in Shaoxing City. If banknotes can be used, the day of departure from Shaoxing should be notified in advance, and the troops stationed in Shengxian should send a team to Shaoxing to meet and escort them. Shaoxing City should also send a team to escort them. The same should be done for Xinchang and Zhuji. For other counties, one team should meet and one team should escort, following the same procedure. (Section 4) County governments and military and police in cocoon-producing counties, as well as old prefectural cities such as Jiahu, Ningshao, and other places where wheeled vehicles pass and where money shops and banks have cash transactions, are requested to instruct local officials to patrol strictly day and night to provide protection. (4) County magistrates and local military and police are responsible for providing protection. It is requested that the county governments and military and police be instructed that from May 5th to June 20th, when Chinese and foreign merchants are transporting cash and goods, they should carefully protect the transportation routes and the locations where cocoon businesses store their funds, day and night, as stated in Article 3. They will be grateful. (5) Cocoon industry associations have been established in cocoon-producing areas of each county. In case of urgent matters, the cocoon directors can consult with the county government or military and police commanders for implementation. In places where associations have not been established, cocoon merchants can directly negotiate. It is requested that orders be issued for uniform approval and implementation to avoid delays. (6) In remote areas where there are no military or police, it is requested that county governments investigate and dispatch police from the county to take care of the area. If there are not enough police, they can borrow them from neighboring counties or request them from the provincial government. Preparations must be made in advance to avoid confusion and danger. In places where troops are stationed, the county government should select a strategic location to borrow houses for accommodation to avoid difficulties for the locals. (7) Goods have different qualities and prices fluctuate. Buying and selling are based on mutual agreement, and forced buying and selling are prohibited. If anyone uses cocoon sales as a pretext to gather a large number of people and forcibly sell cocoons at the cocoon businesses, causing illegal acts, it is requested that county magistrates in cocoon-producing counties be ordered to prohibit such actions and dispatch police to be stationed in the cocoon businesses to maintain order and prevent incidents. It is requested that the above items be followed. If there are any incomplete matters, cocoon merchants and directors can promptly request local officials to approve and implement them for the sake of public convenience.

<p>Anhui Province (1) Cocoon businesses in various counties import and export silver and goods through Wuhu and Datong. From May 20th to June 20th of the national calendar is the period for transporting cash. From June 10th to August 10th is the period for exporting cocoons, a total of eighty days. This is the period for which cocoon merchants throughout the province request protection. It is requested that the naval and land troops and public security police in Wuhu and Datong be instructed to provide appropriate protection at all times. It is also requested that county governments be instructed to comply. (2) Protection is divided into five sections: (Section 1) It is requested that the officers of the stationed troops in Wuhu and Datong send troops to guard the lighters and ports. When ships arrive, the cash should be transferred to the lighters day and night for protection to avoid negligence. (Section 2) It is requested that the troops in Wuhu and Datong provide escort whenever cash is transported from the lighters to the money shops and banks on the shore. (Section 3) It is requested that the troops in Wuhu and Datong provide strict protection wherever cocoon businesses' cash is stored in money shops and banks. (Section 4) It is requested that the troops in Wuhu and Datong, if cocoon merchants transport cash from Wuhu and Datong to various counties, send troops to escort them at the request of the cocoon businesses, and return to camp to cancel their duties after delivery. (Section 5) It is requested that the troops in Wuhu and Datong, if local military and police in inland counties are insufficient to protect the cocoon businesses, approve requests from cocoon merchants for troops to be dispatched to protect them. (Statement) Cocoon merchants have now established the Datong Interior Cocoon Industry Association in Datong, the Wuhu Interior Cocoon Industry Association in Wuhu, the Ningxuan Cocoon Industry Branch in Xuancheng, the Jingnan Jingji Cocoon Industry Branch in Jingxian, the Guangjian Cocoon Industry Branch in Jianping County, the Cocoon Industry Association Preparatory Office in Tianchang County, the Cocoon Industry Branch in Dangtu County, the Gangui Cocoon Industry Branch in Datong, and the Qingyang Cocoon Industry Branch outside Qingyang County, and the Qingyang Cocoon Industry Association Branch Office in Mu Town. It is requested that the county governments and stationed troops be informed that if the cocoon industry associations or cocoon merchants in the counties, townships, and towns request the dispatch of troops for protection, they should be approved immediately without delay, regardless of the distance or the number of people. However, local conditions vary, and the scope of business is not uniform. Therefore, cocoon merchants have always submitted their own requests, with the number of troops requested ranging from more than ten to only four or six, and the locations to which they are dispatched also varying in distance. The delivery of gratuities will still be handled according to established practice. (3) Wuhu and Datong have stationed troops and naval and land police, and the defenses are very strict. During each cocoon market season, cocoon businesses established in the counties within the port request the dispatch of troops from Wuhu and Datong for escort. When cash arrives at the business, they are stationed there until the cocoon business is completed and they return to camp. When additional cash is added for the second time, they go to the camp again to request the dispatch of soldiers for escort, and they return to camp on the same day. The officials have made great efforts to maintain order, which is very thorough. However, for critical passes, the directors of the cocoon industry association may submit a separate letter requesting the dispatch of soldiers for defense. It is requested that this be implemented in advance. If the troops in Datong are insufficient, the military officers stationed in Datong should report to the provincial government to request that nearby troops be dispatched for protection to ensure completeness. (4) Cocoon-producing counties such as Qingyang, Guichi, Tongling, Jingxian, Ningguo, Nanling, Langxi, Xuancheng, Dangtu, Guangde, Tianchang, Jingde, Fanchang, Jixi, Quanjiao, Gantai, Fengtai, Jianping, and other eighteen counties are requested to notify each county in advance to provide strict protection, day and night, for cocoon merchants transporting silver and goods and cocoon businesses storing cash. If cocoon merchants request assistance in the county, it should be approved. (5) If cocoon merchants in Wuhu and Datong request to go to the interior to be stationed for protection, the county government should plan thoroughly and allocate them properly. As for whether each county has military and police and whether they are sufficient for protection, or whether it is necessary to borrow military and police from neighboring counties, or to allocate troops from Wuhu and Datong, each county government should request the approval of the provincial government for implementation to avoid temporary difficulties. (6) The cocoon market is short, and there are often people who use cocoon sales as a pretext to gather dozens of people and forcibly sell cocoons at the cocoon businesses, taking advantage of the situation to engage in illegal acts. This year, the silk industry does not accept sub-contracts and does not allow peddlers to sell cocoons, and follows the instructions issued by the Anhui Finance Department five years ago, using sixteen taels as one catty as the standard, and adding two taels per catty as cocoon wool and moth depreciation according to salt and tea regulations, without any distinction, to prevent disputes. It is requested that county magistrates in cocoon-producing counties select local police to be stationed in the cocoon businesses to maintain order and strictly correct any illegal acts to maintain security and avoid accidents. (7) Goods have different qualities and prices fluctuate. Buying and selling are based on mutual agreement, and forced buying and selling are prohibited. Non-industry personnel must not interfere forcibly. It is requested that county magistrates in cocoon-producing counties be ordered to comply. It is requested that the above items be implemented by the Wuhu and Datong battalion commanders, naval and land public security bureaus, and the county governments of the eighteen cocoon-producing counties. If there are any incomplete matters, cocoon merchants and directors should promptly request local officials to handle them carefully to ensure thoroughness. (Attached list of cocoon-producing counties in Anhui Province) Qingyang County, Guichi County, Tongling County, Jing County, Ningguo County, Nanling County, Langxi County, Xuancheng County, Tianchang County, Dangtu County, Guangde County, Fanchang County, Zude County, Jixi County, Quanjiao County, Gantai County, Fengtai County, Jianping County.</p>

<p>Rice boat crews in Shanghai, due to meager wages that cannot cover their expenses, have once again launched a movement to increase wages and demand that if they are injured or killed in robberies, the shipowners should bear all medical expenses and provide compensation. Yesterday, the crews of various boats in Shanghai discussed this matter at Yizhichun. Representatives from various gangs reported that some shipowners, after being requested, have agreed to increase wages, considering the crews' difficulties, or have already increased wages. However, some shipowners are unwilling to increase wages. After discussion, if they do not increase wages, the crews will request again and set a one-week deadline for a reply.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Child Welfare Society Rescues an Abused Child <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association rescued Xia Lan, who was abused in the home of Li Zhenqing in Nanxiang, on the 14th of last month, as reported in various newspapers. The association has now rescued Lu Laiqiu, an adopted son of the Lu family, who owns a restaurant on Beikai'er Road in this city, who was severely abused by his adopted father. Lu Laiqiu is a Ningbo native, eleven years old. The owner of the Lu family restaurant originally loved this child as his own, but in the past few months, he indulged in gambling, which led to the restaurant's business declining and making it difficult to make a living. The couple agreed to blame Laiqiu. In addition to beating him with firewood sticks from time to time, they repeatedly tried to drown him in the Huangpu River. Fortunately, his adopted uncle (the restaurant owner's cousin) rescued him a month ago and temporarily placed him with Shi Dexing Box Factory on Zhoushan Road in Tilanqiao through the introduction of neighbor Wang Jinheng (from Chongming). After the association received a notification from the outside world yesterday, it sent caseworkers Wang Guanyi and Ding Bingnan to the place. In addition to adopting the child, they also planned to verify the facts of the abuse and file a lawsuit according to law. It happened that Song Shaohuai, a Chongming native, wanted to adopt him as his son. Because Song's family was small but his character kind, the association agreed to his request, issued a certificate, and at the same time, the Lu family, who abused the child, had left Shanghai a few days ago. The association also stated that since the abused person has escaped from the water and fire, it will not pursue the matter for the time being.</p>

It is reported that on the opening day, the Shanghai New Municipal Government Pattern Exhibition will be held at the venue, and it will be open to the public for a week from the 12th, welcoming visitors to view the displays.</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>To the Editor: Regarding the news item in your esteemed newspaper of the 6th of this month, concerning the arrival of automatic telephone equipment in Shanghai, we wish to clarify that the automatic telephone equipment of said bureau was ordered by the Ministry of Communications from our company. All materials were shipped from our main factory in Chicago, USA, to Shanghai. Several batches have already arrived in Shanghai, and the remainder are being continuously shipped by sea. The statement that the equipment was ordered from the German Electric Company and has been shipped from Germany is inconsistent with the facts. Therefore, we are sending this special letter to request immediate correction. Respectfully, American Automatic Electric Company, 19.5.7.</p>
<p>To the Editor: Your newspaper's local news column carried a news item about the arrest of the manager of the Sanyu Fish Company. We have verified that the French Concession court did not issue an arrest warrant, and our manager, Shui Jiaquan, has not been detained. Because this concerns our reputation, we must request a correction. We earnestly hope that this letter will be published in the letters to the editor column. Respectfully, Shui Jiaquan, Manager of Taichang Fish Company, May 7th.</p>
<p>To the Editor: Your newspaper published statements that Song Lanhui married a wife and then had a relationship with another young woman, which is completely untrue. This concerns damage to my reputation, so please correct it immediately. Sincerely, Song Lanhui, Shanghai Shen Bao, May 8, 19th year.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Xu Peikun's Gold-Expensive, Silver-Cheap Relief Plan (Continued) <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The current non-causal reason for Donghui is that due to the lifting of the Japanese gold ban and the recovery of Donghui's gold parity, the Japanese yen is no longer an important factor in controlling our country's silver exchange rate. Although this does not mean that the Japanese yen has no impact on the fluctuation of gold and silver exchange rates. In my humble opinion, if our country's financial system is not reformed, the Japanese yen will still have great power when it gets the chance. As for what forces are controlling the rise and fall of the silver exchange rate today, the simple answer can be as follows:</p>
<p>(4) The position of London's standard silver price</p>
<p>Here, a preliminary question arises: what is the relationship between London's standard silver price and the Shanghai silver exchange rate? According to past experience, the Shanghai silver exchange rate often changes with the gold speculation of Donghui, which shows that London's standard silver price does not have much controlling power over the Shanghai silver exchange rate. At the same time, we can prove that the Shanghai silver exchange rate has great power over the standard silver price. This point seems close to a cyclical debate, but the phenomena of the original action and reaction do exist in fact. The author has studied the relationship between them by statistical methods (this article will be published as soon as the manuscript is completed), and the result is still as described above. Therefore, it can be said that London's standard silver price sometimes determines the Shanghai silver exchange rate and is sometimes determined by the Shanghai silver exchange rate. This is an extremely cautious statement.) In addition to the above-mentioned mutual relationship, the change in London's standard silver price is also affected by various other reasons. Among them, Donghui was once an important factor, because Donghui directly affects the silver exchange rate in Shanghai. Secondly, the silver prices in Bombay, New York and other places are another powerful factor. Therefore, from the perspective of silver as a commodity, observing the complexity of the price-influencing factors and the magnitude of its speculative nature, it is a fallacy to explain the pricing process with a supply and demand law. If it is said that London is the concentration point of various speculative forces, and the silver price is generated from this, this statement is similar to the author's hesitation to use the term "speculation" as the principle of London's standard silver pricing, but before carefully examining other theories, I do not want to directly regard speculation as a principle. If we forcibly apply the supply-demand law, the bank's decision will be at the point where the market supply curve and the market demand curve intersect, and China, as the only powerful silver-using country, will have a huge impact on the demand curve, and thus also have a huge impact on the silver price.

<h3 id="e167">Anecdotes from the Construction Exhibition (Proverb 4) <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction has been established for three years. To commemorate this third anniversary, a first Construction Exhibition was held, displaying exhibits for seven days, to promote awareness and to enable the people to understand the benefits and true meaning of the province's construction efforts. The intention is excellent. There were more than three thousand exhibits, a dazzling array, beautiful and numerous. Although it rained on several days in Hangzhou, visitors were still very enthusiastic. They all gave good comments, saying that it could be compared with the West Lake Exposition. Here are some miscellaneous notes on what I saw and heard.</p>
<p>Zhang Jingjiang braved the rain to attend. The exhibition opened on May 1st. It drizzled in the morning, but provincial and local dignitaries all arrived together. Zhejiang Governor Zhang Jingjiang also braved the rain to come and respectfully read the will. Various dignitaries then gave speeches successively, praising the achievements of the Construction Department in the past and in this exhibition. Afterwards, Huo Baoshu, the acting director of the department, reported on everything. All were broadcast via radio to all directions. The meeting was solemn and grand. After a photograph and refreshments amid the melodious military music, the meeting dispersed.</p>
<p>The room was full of spring. In the evening, an entertainment gala was held in the opening ceremony hall. The programs were all performed by colleagues from the department and staff from affiliated organizations. There were Peking opera, dance, magic, etc. Huo also made a guest appearance, with both southern and northern tunes, each showing its charm. Huo was originally from Guangdong, but his Mandarin is also very fluent. His Peking opera was especially stable. The guests in the room were all very excited and applauded continuously. Later, a film explaining the invention of electric lights and radio was shown, which could increase people's scientific knowledge and was also very interesting for research.</p>
<p>Remarkable achievements. Since Acting Director Huo and Chief Secretary Lin have been keenly managing the department, everything is new. All kinds of things are displayed this time, and the achievements are remarkable. There are 29 affiliated organizations, divided into four groups: industry, commerce, agriculture, mining, water conservancy, and transportation, displaying them. The whole is shaped like the letter T. There are various types of charts, specimens, products, and photographs. From the entrance to the inner room, the order is well-arranged. And the special displays of the six sections of the department are particularly striking.</p>
<p>The lights are brilliant. The department has set up signs in the main streets, urging all walks of life to visit, and a gate tower was erected on the lakeside. At night, the light shines for ten miles. The spectators block the road. The atmosphere of political tutelage and construction fills Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Borrowing an Umbrella to Tour the Mountains by Mei Sheng</p>
<h3 id="e168">Record of Monkey Wine by Li Shiyuan <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>My county has many high mountains and ridges, with natural scenery. Behind White Tiger Mountain, the stone caves surround like a series of stars, where short-tailed monkeys (tails no more than an inch long) live. Monkeys are intelligent. Villagers often bring porcelain bottles of fresh fruit. Upon arrival, they unload them in a corner and pretend to nap beside the cave, acting like they are resting. The monkeys like to play. They always come out and grab everything away. The villagers secretly peek at their whereabouts and know where the monkeys live. More than a month later, they go again. First, they set off firecrackers near the cave several times. The monkeys are all startled and flee out of the cave. The villagers come forward leisurely and go straight into their den. The fruit from the past has been brewed into a rich and strong wine, filling a dozen bottles. They carry them away one by one. Those who are good at drinking all say that its taste is more mellow than any fine wine. I don't know what technique the monkeys use to make this fine wine.</p>
<p>Previously, this magazine published a travelogue by a certain gentleman, who strongly praised the scenery of Niushou Mountain, calling it the best in the new capital. The day after I arrived in Beijing, I accepted an invitation from my friend Mr. Zhang and went on a tour in a group. The impression was excellent. Here are some miscellaneous notes.</p>
<p>Niushou Mountain is only more than twenty li away from Beijing. The county chronicles say that it is forty li away, which is actually an exaggeration. It belongs to the jurisdiction of Jiangning County. It can be reached directly from Beijing by car or horse-drawn carriage. Our group consisted of four people and traveled by horse-drawn carriage. The horse was old and tired. The driver was also old and ignorant. When passing Shizigang, because the road on the hill was very steep, the driver pulled the horse to move forward. The horse did not obey. We got out of the car and pushed it from behind. Just as we pushed it to the middle of the hill, the horse suddenly slipped and retreated. We used all our strength to resist it. Fortunately, nothing happened.</p>
<p>After passing Shizigang and reaching Tiexinqiao, it suddenly rained. We were all very frustrated, but when we saw the green light along the road, the grass and flowers all showed signs of life. Inhale, and the smell is incomparably refreshing and handsome. Niushou Mountain also smiled at the welcoming people. I suddenly felt a surge of pride. When we arrived at the foot of Niushou Mountain, the needle of the watch had pointed to half past one. The rain became stronger. We lingered outside the door of the farmer's house and begged to borrow umbrellas. The villagers initially refused. They promised to pay rent, and then they got three umbrellas.</p>
<p>Zhang Gai moved forward and twisted about a mile. Then I got a mountain climbing path. At that time, the rain was less killing. The four mountains have been replaced by clouds. Looking up at the top of Niushou Mountain, a few laps around the cloud. Lightly swaying like smoke. Tower too. The building is also. The pavilion is also. If there is nothing. Seeing it is amazing. We bravely climbed the mountain and rested at Meian. The so-called Meian is Yumeihua Hall. The ancestral house is several columns, and Qingdao people are enshrined. The old man Shouci burned tea to feed us. I had a big meal of bread here. Very full.</p>
<p>Go to Pujue Temple from Yumeihua Hall. I can't find a monk anywhere. A mountain boy led us to the temple to view the pagoda, which is said to be a bat, pagoda. There is a small path beyond this to climb the mountain. Then I visited Guanyin Cave in order. Yinmachi. Tushita Palace. The nose of the bull is everywhere. All cannot be stayed. Only on the rock of abandoning one's body. Looking at the mountains facing each other. Wrapped in cloud floss. Occasionally open and close. Like a virgin peeping at people. Extremely charming. At that time, the rain line was dense again. We stood precariously with umbrellas and clothes were wet. And the heart is very happy.</p>
<p>On the way back, the wheels and axles were trapped under the bridge because something happened across the small bridge. It was so dangerous that I still feel frightened when I think about it. Zhang Jun said that this is the most memorable thing in the tour.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Briefly Talking About Huizhou with You by Wang Meiyu <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>In the fifth second year of the Republic [1936], Master Zhang Yishan of Taizhou married off his third daughter, Shi Yun, again at the Central Grand Hotel. Because Master Yishan has a melancholic illness, he did not personally preside over the wedding. Mei Yu saw Mrs. Zhang describing Master's recent situation and was quite concerned. There were also few congratulatory guests, and he was hesitating to leave when a guest stepped forward, bowed to me, and inquired with great enthusiasm. So I sat down and talked briefly. The guest's surname was Luo, named Zhiyu, alias Ziyu, fifty-five years old, heavy and unassuming, sincere and respectful. He first inquired about my family, then asked how many daughters Master Yishan had, and then asked about the new groom's family background and talent. I responded based on what I knew. Then, because Mrs. Zhang told me in detail about Master Yishan's sorrow for the times, and also about the disaster situation in Taizhou, Mr. Ziyu then vividly described everything about life in Huizhou. Hearing this, I suddenly realized that Huizhou was originally a major prefecture. Ziyu, who was usually engaged in salt transport, said that Huai salt is now in a desperate situation. Taxes and mortgages, and smuggling are rampant. The salt merchants have almost lost their capital. I said, "Huizhou is a large prefecture, and its commercial prosperity does not rely solely on the Huai salt industry." Ziyu frowned and said, "Whether it's tea, lacquer, or bamboo and wood, they are all Huizhou products, but now they are gone. Tea and red carpets</p>
<h3 id="e170">Another Yu Shuang in Female Roles Edited by Lu <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Yu Shuang's stage name is known throughout the world. Those who have been personally taught or privately admire her are springing up everywhere. However, the mantle has been passed down to only one person in the North and South, namely Xin Yanqiu's name Yu Hua. When I was staying in Beiping [Beijing] in the past, when I was still an unknown actress, I and my old friend Mr. He Xiangya most appreciated her and believed that she was a Yu Shuang among female roles. Indeed, after she went south, her reputation grew day by day. Even old actors like Yang Xiaolou did not hesitate to lower themselves and were willing to act with her, showing a momentum of surpassing the blue and overwhelming Yu Shuang. It has been a long time since then, and I don't know how her skills have progressed. Recently, Wu Fengchun, a well-known teacher from Shanghai, came and said that he had a younger sister named Huang Yanlu, whose makeup and acting were very similar to Yu Shuang. Her face was delicate and beautiful, even more so than Yu Hua. She would be performing that day at the Postal Peking Opera Conference of the Shangzheng Association. He asked me to go and watch. I smiled and nodded, but didn't take it seriously. In the evening, Wu came again, so I went with him. Upon arriving at the meeting, Wu brought the beauty to see me. Her face was beautiful, just like Yu Hua. Her conversation was especially elegant and pleasing, even better than Yu Hua. The play performed that night was "Bao Lian Deng," co-starring with the famous amateur actor Wang Zhenbai. This gentleman's makeup was elegant and his voice was sweet and pleasant. His pronunciation and dialogue were especially clear and valuable. He is an old hand in this. Yanlu's makeup was extremely beautiful, and even the beauty of a lotus emerging from the water cannot fully describe it. Her movements were also graceful and charming. In the scene, the slow beat and fast triple beat of the entrance were accurate and sonorous, fully capturing the essence of Yu Shuang. After entering, her dialogue with Mr. Wang was clever and crisp, like chewing pears. The shake plate was also extremely delicate. She is indeed a lovely person. The person who played the piano for Yanlu was her teacher Fengchun, which added a lot to the color. (Repaid)</p>
<p>It is a large commodity for Huizhou merchants. The Russians have always used Chinese tea. Every year, the number of sales is extremely large. Now Russia is also in economic straits. Since the European War, coupled with the disaster of communism, Chinese tea has been sluggish, and sales have been reduced by almost 50-60% compared with before the European War. In the past one or two years, it has been even worse. The lacquer industry is also declining. The reason for this can be roughly said to be the poverty of the people and the heavy taxes. To analyze it, it is also the Western lacquer from foreign countries, which takes it away by force. The bamboo industry is second only to the tea and lacquer industries, and the timber industry is also a major item. The people suffer from deficits and enter the mountains to collect firewood. I can't wait. Approximately 8-inch diameter wood has been felled, and you try to think about the growth of wood, which is not like a weed, and the supply does not meet the demand. The income is thrifty, and it is like cutting out the flesh of the heart compared to the new silk in May and the new grain in August. I said, "Is that so? You are a Huizhou person. Do you only know about Huizhou? The world is so big, and there are countless places like Huizhou." Ziyu said, "Yes, Wuhu has always been a rice-producing area, but now it is also in great trouble. The treacherous merchants are trying to make small profits by transporting it abroad, and the foreigners are using our rice to increase its value and absorb our assets." I also spoke about the recent rise in rice prices in Rugao to thirty-three yuan, and he was eloquent. Suddenly, the sound of drums and trumpets interrupted him, so he went to the guest seat to watch the wedding. The new groom, Zhang Shanle, was extremely handsome, and the new couple both had legal knowledge. The handing over of the comb and towel was also preceded by the handing over of education. The words of instruction proclaimed by the masters of ceremonies of both families can all follow the right path of humanity and will be the love of parents to the slightest extent.</p>
<h3 id="e171">New Method of Insulating Urban Noise by Lu Bing <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>I read in a previous column that the noise in New York City is enough to harm the health of residents and cause many cases of deafness. Urban noise is most prevalent in the United States, because there are many factories and streetcars, resulting in huge noise levels that can be heard everywhere, and there is almost no clean place. According to a recent issue of the American magazine, this kind of obnoxious noise has long attracted the attention of the scientific community. They want to invent an object that can absorb part or all of the noise so as not to disturb the eardrums. After many tests, they have found several substances that naturally have the above-mentioned effects. One of them has a particularly great ability to isolate noise, called EelGrass. This algae is produced on the coast of Newfoundland. Although it can also be collected elsewhere, the quantity is small. The method is to wash the algal leaves, dry them in the sun, and then use thick brown paper on both sides for insulation, adding extremely heavy pressure to make them firm and thick. If this creates a brick shape, take it to stack the surrounding walls, then people are in it. Outside the sound wave can be ignored. It is very difficult to collect and manufacture algal leaves. The price is also expensive. One more floor. People in the algae room can talk to each other. Because all sides can be absorbed. It is not easy to distinguish without shouting loudly. In fact, it is not an ear canal, but it is affected by algae and becomes hard of hearing. And to use it as a church classroom, etc. This algae room is even more unsuitable. Therefore, although scientists have successfully tested it, it has not been widely used in the United States.</p>

<p>Eleventh Episode: Cui Luo Zhu Qiao, Celebrated Ladies Return, Talented Scholars, Azure Houses, Crimson Curtains, Young Women Marry into High Society</p>
<p>Let's talk about this episode. It was Mei Lanfang's first time coming to Shanghai, so the longing of the Shanghai gentry women was very strong. Because at that time, he already had a reputation in Beijing. There were many people who supported him. He had a publicity department. Of course, it was close to people in the newspaper industry. This publicity department was out of a sincere heart and did not spend half a cent of funds. Compared to the publicity departments of other political parties, it was even more loyal. The loyal comrades of the Mei Party, and they were all contemporary writers. They wrote those articles to protect the party. Not only were they publicized in Beijing, but they also had to send the manuscripts to Shanghai newspapers for publicity. You all know that writing promotional articles has a lot to do with the quality of the article. People with poor writing skills, say it over and over again, just those few words, can't come up with anything new. Open your mouth and see your throat. It's as if as soon as you open your mouth, people know what you're going to say. Therefore, that kind of promotional text, as long as you read a few lines, people can't read it anymore. If you teach people with excellent writing skills to do propaganda work, they can come up with all kinds of ideas and turn out all kinds of tricks. If he wants to support someone, or if he doesn't support that person, he first criticizes many people. He also praises people who are not the goal, but with many shortcomings, not as good as a certain person, who is a complete talent and complete beauty. This is called the method of setting off the moon with clouds. Or it only discusses one kind of art, and does not focus on people, but only a certain person is the best at that kind of art. Fallen leaves return to their roots, and it is still for him to promote it. And the elegance of the writing and the brilliance of the strokes are all related. People see that his article is good. Even if they don't want to promote this person in their hearts, they unknowingly fall into the magic of his writing and publish it for him. Therefore, they even spread the famous sentences in the text. Isn't this a trick of cunning writers? There are many capable people in Mei Lanfang's party department, all of whom are writers and lyricists. In the city of Beijing, in the late Qing Dynasty, there were originally those officials of the Ci Cao Department, and it was a common practice to support actors. Since the so-called Eight Great Hutongs in recent years have declined from Yin to Yang, they have been completely occupied by those girls. It is difficult to get a talented person. There are also many who are unworthy of being supported. No matter how eloquently it is said, its original quality is nothing more than that. Or after putting on makeup, it is still passable. But after taking off the makeup, the cheekbones are high, the cheeks are protruding, the chest is upright, and the back is hunched. A vulgar appearance is also disappointing. Seeing is believing. In the end, you have to see it with your own eyes to be correct. Now, Mei Lanfang, after putting on makeup, is light and graceful, making people satisfied. He really is a woman. Even after taking off the makeup, he feels handsome and fresh. He is a beautiful man. Therefore, today, those people in the Mei Party first come out to show their faces when he is not wearing makeup.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Banks Still Closed, Silver Market Quiet <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong Cocoon Merchants Absorb… Sudden Rise to Over 6 Qian</p>
<p>Market Overview. In recent days, various banks on the Bund have been closed for horse racing, leading to passive operations in the financial sector. Although the cocoon market is currently thriving, instability in various locations and frequent robberies have made shippers cautious, a major factor contributing to the bleak market sentiment. Silver supply has been good recently. However, the exclusive nature of "Tian" drafts prevents significant prosperity, even during busy periods.</p>
<p>Discount Rates. "Foreign Dollar" rates were 7 qian 1 fen 9 li and a half in the morning, seemingly better by 2 hao and a half compared to the previous market. The afternoon market was better by half a li, totaling 7 qian 2 fen, matching Monday's market conditions. "Silver Discount" draft trading has gradually become prosperous, but the exclusive nature of "Tian" is a drawback. Therefore, silver discounts remain stable and have not risen. Yesterday's morning market was 1 qian 3 fen, and the afternoon only opened at 1 qian. "Hua Tou" still had no market.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currency Market Conditions. Jiangnan small dollars were 6 qian 2 fen 9 li in both the morning and afternoon markets, with transactions occurring. Only 3,000 jiao were traded in the morning market. Guangdong small dollars were 5 qian 9 fen 9 li 8 hao 7 hu and a half in the morning, and suddenly rose to 6 qian 007 hao and a half in the afternoon, a difference of nearly 1 li between the two markets. This was because external funds were used, absorbed by cocoon merchants, causing market prices to rise again. Transactions totaled 135,000 jiao in the morning and 115,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins were 398,500 wen, slightly lower by 200 wen compared to the previous day. Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow. Yesterday's news about bank silver collection and distribution was unavailable due to ongoing horse racing and afternoon closures. As a result, detailed figures were not available for recording. Money shops and silver guilds collected and distributed over 24 million, Hua Tou collected and distributed over 2.8 million, and various route exchange collected and distributed over 700,000. Foreign currency exchange and Hua Tou drafts traded 1,576,500 in the morning and 1,220,000 in the afternoon. Banknotes had no market in the morning and 30,000 in the afternoon. Off-exchange banknotes were 94,000 in the morning and 55,000 in the afternoon. Spot currency was 128,000 in the morning and 230,050 in the afternoon. Bank trading only had interbank trading of 400,000 in the morning. Various banks exchanged and settled over 1.3 million, settled over 1.5 million against money shops, interbank borrowing of over 600,000, money shops bought and settled over 3.7 million, small money shops had interbank transactions of 500,000 to 600,000, customer sources of over 400,000, cocoon funds installed spot currency of over 400,000, and banknotes of 1,560,000.</p>

<p>Other Bonds Also Weak… Approximately 6.1 Million Yuan Traded</p>
<p>Yesterday's Shanghai securities market saw numerous types of bonds traded, but in small amounts. Futures trading was flat as before, with very little activity. Buying activity was strong in the morning, with an upward trend. Some bonds increased slightly compared to the previous day. Later, selling became smoother, and bond prices fluctuated downwards. As a result, Customs Consolidated Loan spot retracted by 8-9 jiao compared to the previous day, and other bonds decreased by 4-5 jiao. However, the 7-year 96 and Financial bonds remained stable, only decreasing slightly by 2 jiao. Total futures trading for the day was approximately 6.6 million yuan, including approximately 2.5 million for Customs, 1.21 million for Consolidated Loan, over 800,000 each for the 6% Loan and Reorganization Loan, 475,000 for the Continuing Loan, 300,000 for the Disbandment Loan, 95,000 for the 96 Public Bond, 50,000 for Financial Bonds, 10,000 for the 7-year Bond, and 320,000 for the Continuing Roll.

<p>The yarn market is bleak and lifeless, with a very scattered situation. The market shows slight ups and downs, therefore people’s hearts are softened, and the transactions in the market are very small. There are many empty boards when opening bids for the distant months. This kind of phenomenon is rare in history, and the holding between the multi and empty sides is still fierce. Outsiders are aware of this stalemate and all stop doing things, so the market remains unchanged for a while.</p>
<p>The futures yarn market is calm and the people mark the opening of the previous market. The situation is plain but there is a lack of new throwing households and the market is slightly tight. As a result, the prices of each month increased by two, three, four, and five cents, but there were very few transactions. There was not much change in the afternoon, and the market has not opened for the 90 liang month for the whole period, which is very rare. Other months all fell by two cents, and the total transaction volume for the whole day was only 2,450 bales. The closing price recorded by Ren Zhong is recorded on the left:</p>

<p>Fading Actual Demand. The sales of actual yarns are relatively weak. It is found that all the gangs bought 675 bales throughout the day, and 50 bales were brought into the industry. The Guangdong gang bought the most, with 350 bales. In addition, 80 bales were shipped to Sichuan, 30 bales to Jiangxi, 35 bales to Xiamen, 40 bales to Changsha, 20 bales to Xuzhou, 40 bales to the inland, 20 bales to Niuzhuang, 25 bales to Qinhuangdao, and 40 bales to various gangs.</p>

<p>The cotton market is flat with a soft trend. There are rises and falls in overseas telegraphs. The hearts of people in this port are exhausted. The Japanese firm Dongmian Foreign Company continues to sell, and some short-sellers make up for their losses this month. There are rumors on the business market that Dongmian intends to deliver goods for the May period, so the market atmosphere is weak. The Chinese gang’s thinking of doing more has not changed due to the exhaustion of low-priced goods from all over the place, so the cotton market is difficult to predict for a while.</p>
<p>The futures cotton market rises and falls by five cents. The Chinese standard market opens flat in the previous market, but the current month is relatively soft and the distant months see rises. As a result, all months rose or fell by five cents to one cent. The market in the afternoon became soft, and all months fell by five cents. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 14,100 piculs. The closing price of Han Biao is recorded on the left:</p>

<p>The arrival and sale of spot cotton are both deserted, and transactions are not smooth. Various factories have a very slow intake of goods. The recorded sales of 300 bales of Yao cotton are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton: 38.00, Zhenhua Factory shipped 100 pieces of spot goods to the factory, and also, Yao Tijan Cotton: 36.10, Da Cheng Factory shipped 200 bales and also sent to Changzhou.</p>

<p>The decline in the price of new American cotton has not weakened. Yesterday, the price of American cotton fell initially due to good weather, and then rebounded slightly due to the compensation of empty households. It is estimated that the price of old cotton rose by four to five pounds, and the price of new cotton fell by ten to eleven pounds. The price of spot cotton has not changed. The price of British cotton futures rose by two to three points, and the price of spot cotton rose by eight points. The price of Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by fifteen points, and the Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (6th telegram):</p>

<p>Silk Tea Western Firm Silk Market Spring Race Is Suspended</p>
<p>The Shanghai Western Firm Silk Market continued to be suspended due to the spring race period. Foreign firms only have half a day of market in the morning. Now that overseas silk sales are not moving and the telegrams are not forwarded, European firms are all watching and waiting. Most Chinese silk merchants are busy collecting cocoons. It is said that there were no negotiations for the current or futures silk markets yesterday, and no transactions were heard of.</p>

<p>Silkworm Ants Are Forming Cocoons in Large Numbers... Early Silkworms Will Be Shedding Cocoons Tomorrow</p>
<p>The silkworm flood in Zhejiang Province is earlier than that in Jiangsu Province, and the areas of Yuhang and Haining Chang'an in Hangzhou Province are earlier than Jiahu and other areas by four or five days. This year, the hatching of seeds in Hangzhou County and other places was earlier, but the climate was not good. At first, it was cold and hot, and then it was cold and rainy, which caused the silkworms to develop slowly, and silkworm farmers felt it difficult to raise them. Fortunately, most of the seeds are improved species, and officials are sent to guide and take care of them. Improved species have little loss, but local species have lost a lot after the third sleep until the major sleep in the bud leaves. Now the cocoons are forming in large numbers, and the early silkworms will be shedding cocoons tomorrow. The cocoon firms in Hangzhou County, Yuhang, Haining, Chang'an and other places are expected to be able to open the scales around the 10th.</p>

<p>Yesterday, about ten ships arrived at each stall in Zhabei, and the market sales were dull and unmoving. The trend of white japonica rice was still the same as the previous day. The overall trend was still high and then fell, so the medium and secondary japonica rice were subject to price cuts every day. Customers stopped taking delivery of goods priced above 17 yuan. Although the price was short, there was no intake. There were few arrivals and sales of thin rice, and the situation was depressed. The top goods were still actively sold, and the rest were soft. The mutton and dujian rice were also tired, because there were few customers and the goods were poor, and the influence of foreign rice could only follow the market and decline. The buying was weak and the bottom was still thick, so the market continued to be small.</p>
<p>Ships arrived at the Shanghai South River one after another, and the roads were smooth. Changshu and Xibei japonica rice improved, then fell again. The market was similar to the previous one. Su Tong white japonica rice sales were not moving, but high-priced rice was still welcomed by some customers, while secondary rice was not transacted, and the price was flat. The southern early rice had few arrivals and sales, but the market was not prosperous, and the market was also short. The mutton dujian rice was still mainly from Nanzhuang local towns, and there were few Tongli and Beizhuang. The sales were very light, and the market was stable and inconsistent, with ups and downs of about a few corners. The white yuan market was deserted, and the goods arriving recently were also barren. Most of the guest gangs are watching and waiting, only the local street is slightly entering, and the price is still mediocre.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market stabilized. The market was originally expected to be tired due to prosperous arrivals, but it was stable because the Yangtze River gang had excellent sales and purchased more than 10,000 bags. The sporadic local customers also have an appetite. Xiao Jiaomi is the best seller, with nearly 10,000 bags sold. Sai Kung Minda Jiaomi each only had 1-2,000 bags. No. 1 Sai Kung was 15 yuan 4 jiao and a half, No. 2 was 14 yuan 7 jiao and a half, Xiao Jiaomi was 14 yuan 6 jiao and a half, Da Jiaomi was 14 yuan 7 jiao, Minda was 15 yuan 05 cents, the middle and lower grades were reduced accordingly, and then the situation temporarily stabilized.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Flour Prices Rise Sharply <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Northern Sales Are Active... Manufacturers Are Taking Delivery. Near and Far Leap... About Two Cents Yesterday, the flour market rose again and again in each month, especially the increase in this month. I have already said before what the key to this month is. The attitudes between the factories are different, and it seems that there has been infighting in the inside. The expiration and violent fall in the previous month was difficult to get rid of because customers could not afford it. When the price was opened this month, because the market fell miserably, the northern sales had been jointly planned for a long time, and Tianjin's reserves were not abundant, and the sales were very smooth. The need for Shanghai flour is not as indifferent as before. Taking advantage of this opportunity, a certain factory gradually took delivery of more than 100,000 bags this month, so those who know the inside story have long expected it to change. During the Qinghuang season, attention should be paid to actual sales. Now that the northern sales are active, and the Yangtze River area is also moving from time to time, the big factory also intends to raise the price, so it is very easy to rise sharply. Considering the recent situation, it should be the first step to reach two liang and five qian. If the customers are still being drawn out, I am afraid there are two or three good degrees. As a result, this month has risen by two cents and seven li and a half from the previous day. The distant period has also risen sharply due to the reported rise of foreign wheat by five, six, seven, and eight corners. It is estimated that the June increase is two cents and a half, the July increase is one cent and seven li and a half, the August increase is one cent and a half, the September increase is two cents, and the October increase is one cent and a half.</p>

<p>Chapter 38: Nineteenth-Century French Prose by Lanfaxi</p>
<p>Du De's friends, Edmond de Goncourt and his brother Jules, were leaders of the Naturalists, or more accurately, the Visualists. To them, life was not so much material for stories, but rather material for detailed descriptions like paintings. However, as Stevenson said, the typical French story of literature is superior to their theories. In several of their novels, if only one is mentioned, such as "Renée Mauperin," they combine the ancient art of storytelling with the meticulous analysis or impressionistic depiction of the inner workings of characters, which is somewhat new in their hands. More important than the novel is the "Diary," which is not only an expression of the author's beliefs and personality, but also a brilliant light shining on French literature of the 19th century. Edmond de Goncourt left property to establish the "Academy," initially a protest against the official French Academy, but now a generally recognized organization. Its supreme substantive award for literary achievement is coveted by all young French writers. It has always been a powerful force in French literature advocating freedom and courage.</p>
<p>Deeply influenced by Goncourt, but also going his own way with a strangely shaped fierce will and strength, is J.K. Huysmans. He began with realistic novels like "Marriage Life" as a follower of Zola, and ended with religious mysticism, such as "The Abbey." Only two or three of Huysmans' books have been adequately translated into English, or not at all. His richly colored prose is difficult to translate. He is clearly an author's author, a darling of literary people. However, he will surely become even more famous in France and other countries in the future.</p>
<p>A delicate artist whose beauty can be appreciated by all kinds of readers is Pierre Loti, who died in 1923. He was a naval officer who had seen much of the world and felt the magic of the sea and exotic lands. He skillfully and honestly reproduced his experiences and impressions in his novels and memoirs. In the South Seas, he saw "Loti's Marriage," in Japan, "Madame Chrysanthème," and on the Breton coast and the North Sea, "An Iceland Fisherman." He also infused his sensitive personality into external descriptions and events.</p>
<p>Loti is an Impressionist; in his view, the world is color, is sensation, and is an experience that has little to do with morality in the sense of good and evil, wherever it is found. Paul Bourget gradually inclined towards a conservative, moral view of life, a sharp, or rather, strict researcher of society. He delves into the hearts of the characters he portrays. If his attitude were less gentlemanly, it would strike our hearts. However, he is an artist, and "The Disciple" and "The Promised Land" are novels of first-rate value. Bourget and his era are somewhat harsh and overly realistic in their analysis, and conservative in their view of life. Before the Great War, there were young, but not necessarily immature, people who saw "life" in the light of a new idealism. The main figure among them was Romain Rolland, whose "Jean-Christophe" is an international novel with a German musician who gained some experience in France as its protagonist. Although it is infinitely long, it is widely read in France, and in its English translation. His spirit embraces the world, but the world embraced in 1914 became a death grip. Romain Rolland, in a booklet called "Above the Battle," strove to rise above it. For this booklet, and other humanitarian articles, he did not gain fame among the warring nations. Anatole France maintained the tranquility of the privileged old era. Henri Barbusse (in "Under Fire") and other writers made use of the war.</p>
<p>Looking at modern English and American literature, we see that it is impossible to point out what is being done or what is an influential movement. For someone who did not come into being within it, who did not live in it, it is much more difficult to evaluate, judge, or even know a work in that literature at a glance. Nevertheless, we can try to suggest, not as a prophecy, that the death of Marcel Proust marked the end of an era. His novel "Remembrance of Things Past" seems to be a meticulous study of modern society seen by a sensitive observer, the culmination of psychological novels over half a century, a summary of what already exists, and also a prelude to the unknown future of the novel.</p>
<p>In one department of literature, France occupies a supreme position: criticism. From Balo to Rémy de Gourmont and the young people of today, French criticism has always been creation in the highest sense, excellent in itself and for itself, and of immense value for its influence on other forms of literature. The school of Sainte-Beuve, Renan, Taine, and Scherer is still flourishing. Following the elder giants, Brunetière and Faguet, two scholars, appeared, as well as Anatole France, the greatest of the impressionistic critics. France is often a critic even in his novels. Two outstanding figures who died young are Marcel Schwob, who had a keen and knowledgeable interest in English literature almost as much as in French literature, and Émile Hennequin, whose extremely concise studies of French writers and even foreign writers such as Dickens as part of French literature can be regarded as the last word in the art of literary essays. In the department of criticism, the entire literary world bows to France.</p>

<p>The palace mistresses are hosting a banquet.</p>
<p>In order to make the location suitable, the palace mistresses had to make do and chose a small restaurant near the school that was relatively clean to host the banquet. The time was 7:00 PM, when the dinner rush was about to end. Although the filthy little restaurant was empty, the messy tables and chairs and the cluttered cups and plates had not yet been cleaned up. The palace mistresses, fearing that the invited young masters would be hungry, urged the waiters to hurry up and clean up, while they themselves helped with the arrangements. The fragrance of sweat permeated from their clothes, mixing with the greasy air. Their disheveled hair became even more disheveled. After a burst of activity, the small restaurant actually took on a new look. The messy tables were put together to form a rectangular dining table, covered with a clean white tablecloth, and several pots of flowers and plants were placed in the middle. In this way, it was indeed much more beautiful.</p>
<p>In addition to the decorations, a delicate and exquisite name card was placed in front of each seat, so that the young masters could sit according to their assigned seats and not mess up the order pre-determined by the palace mistresses. The patterns on the name cards were made of colored ink splattered on them, which were very beautiful. It is said that these were specially made by the palace mistresses themselves, spending a lot of time. After everything was arranged, the hosts asked the waiters to invite the invited young masters, who were separated in another room, to take their seats. It turned out that the impatient young masters had arrived very early. The palace mistresses, fearing that standing beside them would be inconvenient for the arrangements, stuffed them all into another room to wait. At this time, the young masters were indeed as hungry as the palace mistresses had guessed, constantly looking at the clock and waiting until the waiter said the word "please," they all appeared one by one in the dining hall as if they were flying. They were all wearing Western suits, with stiff trouser legs, plus a very obvious and sharp pleat. Their waists and backs were stiff and straight. Although one or two of them were as thin as weasels and short, their spirit was extraordinary. They stretched their necks upward with force, almost hiding the shortcomings of their shortness. There was also one whose eyes were white and staring at a palace mistress with a smile. The palace mistresses also greeted them with smiles.</p>
<p>They took their seats and the dishes were served one after another. The hungry young masters all restrained their laughter and busied themselves moving their lips up and down, but they still couldn't cope with the chopsticks of food being sent from their hands. They didn't even have the leisure to distinguish the taste, because they were all secretly wondering how the stupid cook could cook such delicious dishes.</p>
<p>The palace mistresses remembered the entertainment they had prepared. Taking advantage of everyone burying their heads in their bowls, they quickly brought out the paper basket. The basket was filled with many paper strips folded into concentric knots. The paper strips were written with various actions and songs. They went around the seats and asked each person to pick one. After the young masters saw what was written on the paper strips, they were all a little hesitant to perform. However, how could they withstand the urging of the strict commander, the palace mistress? So laughter rose again. Laughing actions and ear-piercing songs were performed and sung one after another. Some kowtowed to the person opposite them, some imitated the cries of birds and beasts, some did somersaults on the ground, some...some...</p>
<p>In the midst of wild laughter, the young masters and palace mistresses dispersed. The silent road was suddenly filled with pleasant air. The moon was also very good at joining in the fun, emitting a different kind of light to illuminate the proud sons of heaven who were returning to the palace with an indescribable feeling of joy in their hearts.</p>
<h3 id="e190">The Construction of the Central University Auditorium <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The news of the construction of the Central University Auditorium had been heard two years ago. However, it was initially a pie in the sky due to lack of funds. Last year, President Zhang re-proposed the discussion on Commemoration Day, and said that no matter what, construction would begin in February or March this year, and the building would be completed in six months. Therefore, the roar of building the auditorium unknowingly started again. At that time, we students were really overjoyed under this situation of "the mountain rain is about to come, the wind is filling the building."</p>
<p>Ah, our "overjoyed" emotions continued until March 28 this year, when the auditorium's construction project actually began. While this construction project has not yet been completed, let me talk about the various things related to the construction of the Central University Auditorium.</p>
<p>The current buildings on the campus of Central University all have concrete plans. When it was Dongda University, American designer Meng Fei was hired to design the entire school's drawings. The new additions are mostly built according to this drawing. The recent plan and drawings for the construction of the auditorium, of course, cannot escape the exception. In addition, the school's twelfth administrative meeting last semester resolved that a project construction audit committee must be established to discuss any construction of houses with a cost of more than 5,000 yuan. Therefore, this construction of the auditorium also followed this resolution. First, a project construction audit committee was organized, and President Zhang separately sent letters to hire Mao Xie, Lu Shusen, Liu Futai, Liu Duncun, Lin Pingyi, Yu Liji, Wang Mingzhi, Xue Shaoqing, Zhang Yiqiao, and Cha Xiaoxian as ten members of the Auditorium Construction Committee. However, when the project construction audit committee was organized the year before last, it was still in the era of the university district system, and the distribution of offices in the auditorium was prepared for the use of both the university headquarters and the Executive Yuan. Now that the university district system has been abolished and the Executive Yuan has ended, the offices have been changed, so the drawings of the auditorium have also been changed. According to President Zhang's report on the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Day on December 23 last year, the drawings of the auditorium are as follows:</p>
<p>"The location of the auditorium is at the end of Dazhong Road, opposite the main gate, that is, in front of the flat dormitory. The Science Hall is on its left, and the future Industrial Hall is on its right. The Biology Hall is in front of the Science Hall, and the Library is in front of the Industrial Hall. These five buildings stand side by side, and the auditorium is in the center, forming a situation where the springs and stars surround the North Star. In front of the auditorium, the corridors form a circle, in the middle of which is planned to build a bronze statue of Sun Yat-sen. The style of the auditorium adopts the ancient European style. The front corner tops and four round columns are in the Greek style, and the middle dome is in the Roman style. From bottom to top, it is 104 feet high. The top is made of copper with heat-insulating glass windows. Light is introduced into the auditorium through these glass windows. On both sides of the auditorium, the offices are on the left and the professors' lounge is on the right, with roof gardens above. The plane of the hall is octagonal, the podium is very large and can be used as a stage. There are also dressing rooms next to it. There are three floors inside. The second and third floors have boxes and offices. The third floor has a movie machine room. In total, the three floors can accommodate 2,500 people." (The above is from the Central University Daily on December 24, 1929).</p>
