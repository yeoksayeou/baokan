<p>時評</p>
<h3>墨西哥將開世界會議</h3>
<p>此次世界之銀厄大原因以年來銀之産額日增而需要日少此爲各國人士所公認欲挽救此銀賤之厄運雖爲各國共同應負之責然産銀國所負之責尤重何也欲限制産量以謀調節惟産銀國獨操其權也</p>
<p>墨西哥總統爲欲挽救世界銀厄擬召開世界會議集産銀國與用銀國之代表於一堂而討論之誠爲今日萬不可少之舉而美國與加拿大之大銀礦主均將派代表參與尤爲世界所盼望然而世界上利害相互之問題每不肯犧牲已國一部分之利以去世界大多數共同之害如近外電所載墨銀礦商對此之意見在以推銷現銀於銀器製造界爲惟一之救濟方法而不主以暫停銀礦開採爲救濟其實美術工藝等用銀之需要究屬有限使銀之産額增加無已而但以美術工藝爲尾閭則終無法以容納之也又謂銀之出産大部分爲銅鉛等礦之副産物若僅停開銀礦則仍不足以限制銀産額之增加必須并停銅鉛等礦之開採而後可其意之不欲停開銀礦以犧牲銀礦商之利已顯然可見然其實銀礦之産銀實佔大部分苟使美加墨各産銀國能將多數銀礦酌量加以限制則有裨於今日之銀巿必非淺鮮也</p>
<p>此次銀賤潮流實因各國競以無用之銀向中國推銷於是中國之受禍遂獨甚然究其結果各國亦未嘗有利故在此江河日下之情勢下即用金之各國亦當協力以謀補救乃淺見之國猶視此問題爲中國之問題與國無關甚且謂中國銀巿之混亂由中國獨自造成者此則甚可異也</p>

<h3>日陸相决留任</h3>
<p>政府再三慰留</p>
<p>各方繼起非難</p>
<p>日聯社十五日東京電陸相十四日託鈴木翰長傳交辭表然爲翰長拒絶旋使溝口次官交付首相首相又拒絶受理溝口辭去後首相即與江木鐵相商量結果派鐵相會見陸相極力懇請留任並謂特任阿部次官爲代理大臣攝任陸軍事務陸相旋與金谷武藤兩大將商議善後至九時半再使阿部次官前往首相官邸詢問首相眞意首相亦懇請留任於是陸相遂决意留任將自已進退問題及設置代理問題一任首相</p>
<p>日聯社十五日東京電政府使陸相决意留任之政治的理由如左（一）元老方面多有反對陸相辭職者又濱口首相切實希望宇垣陸相爲閣員之一（二）政府於組閣當時發表之十大政綱中軍政改革一項非以宇垣氏之手段極難實現（三）政府與海軍紛爭之後陸相辭職則恐被反對黨所利用</p>
<p>日聯社十五日東京電陸軍部内對於陸相之留任大有非難即謂陸相旣使溝口次官折衝南大將繼任陸相職務然今因個人的考慮决意留任設置有名無實之代理大臣在今陸軍重大時機不應有此種行動云云</p>
<p>電通社十五日東京電政友會對政府挽留宇垣陸相設置陸相代理無任所大臣事大加攻擊謂如此措置無異容許陸相曠職政府如此苦留陸相必有不可告人之隱濱口内閣口主政治光明而出此卑怯手段彌縫一時欲欺國民實極可怪云云貴院方而對此亦多非難謂政府祇急於打算目前利害關係開設置次官無任所大臣新例將留禍根於將來云</p>

<h3>工黨政府前途</h3>
<p>（歐洲特訊）</p>
<p>（一）海軍會議（二）印度政策</p>
<p>（三）失業問題（四）工黨將來</p>
<p>當法西士主義四處蔓延之今日在歐洲舊勢力之各國政府中比較進步而號稱代表勞工羣衆者厥唯英之工黨内閣故其現在與將來最堪注意蓋就此一端即可窺見世界政治局面之前進或後退也唯吾人試一研究英國工黨政府之政策與地位不能不覺其前途之黯淡</p>
<p>工黨政府所處地位若何國會情勢最足表明之政府黨近月在貴族院迭遭失敗以英國政制論原無足輕重唯當兹内外紛紜之際不免使政府威望更受打擊但下議院爲内閣存亡所繫近來對政府形勢日趨惡劣實大可慮當煤業案在下院討論時工黨地位已形不佳至本月二十日保守黨議員藉口失業人數日多政府無法補救對負責閣員Ｊ·Ｈ·ＴＨomas湯姆士提出彈劾案（其形式爲提議削減其薪俸）政府方面僅得維持十五票之多數因是日自由黨議員放棄表决權以示中立同時工黨議員十五人亦放棄表决權表示對本黨政府不滿意此種局面在英國政黨史上殊不多覯</p>
<p>至于工黨内閣政策已具體表現者當以外交方面爲最著上次總選中工黨所號召之一大政策爲限制軍備以求世界平和今春倫敦海軍會議即英工黨當局外交之結果海軍條約議定英美日三國獲得相對限制海軍之妥協不能不歸功於工黨之努力但保守黨領袖對於倫敦條約深致不滿其攻擊最烈之點有二（一）關於巡洋艦之規定英國承認其最低需要僅爲五十隻（二）英國巡洋艦之更換新船至一九三六年只限於九一○○○噸反對黨意見認此次條約名爲肯定英美平等實是英國落後旣危國平又示弱於人將來該條約提出下院批准時恐難免發生問題平情而論海會結果减少英美衝突機會在英美雙方人民均當引爲幸事就英國言經濟情形旣不容許其與美國作海軍競爭（此次條約可使英國於一九三○至三六年中减輕五六千萬鎊之負担）故此次將海上覇權與美國均分又豈得已至若法意衝突因海軍會議而愈形明顯亦足徵帝國主幾本身之矛盾其根本病源仍在社會經濟中倫敦會議果能消弭戰禍乎</p>
<p>英工黨外交政策對强國如美如曰雖不惜退讓對弱小民族如埃及如Ｐalestine則襲用英國傳統辦法（一）巴力士坦自經國際聯盟交英國代管以來亞剌伯人與猶太人間之衝突有加無已去年八月事件發生後英國官吏益勵行高壓手叚並提倡猶太移民往該地以制亞剌伯人最近亞剌伯代表團赴倫敦請願要求限制移民保留地産頒布憲法均被拒絶（二）埃及代表團到英交涉改訂舊約收回蘇丹Ｓuden完全主權並討論撤退英國駐兵及解决蘇彝士運河管理權等問題雙方堅持不下交涉遂至决裂唯世界公論實表同情於埃乃者多</p>
<p>現在工黨政府最覺棘手之事莫過於印度問題國際輿論所最關切者亦莫過於印度問題印度獨立運動不自今日始大戰後進行尤力英國方面始終持其武力與虚言應付並利用印人内閧不肯退讓唯此次大爆發值適工黨主政印度羣衆原以爲倫敦當局態度必較前公平不料自不合作運動進而爲不服從運動以來印度總督乃實行摧殘凡運動熱烈之區如德里Ｄelhi喀爾喀特Ｃalcutta北夏華Ｐeshawar等城均發生慘劇死傷以千計被捕者牢獄爲滿甘地被捕後繼起領袖如八十老翁狄亞白基（ＡbbasＴyabji）及素負盛名之女詩家奈都夫人）ＭrsNaidu）復先後被拘下獄同時禁止出版集會砲艦飛機四出示威凡此種種事實雖出於印度總督之手而最高負責者實爲倫敦之政府然工黨當局仍高唱「圓棹會議」「西門報告」等論調其態度與一年前在野時攻擊保守黨時完全相反無怪乎工黨左派時起抗議也另一方面保守自由兩黨對工黨印度政策則莫不欣然表示同情吾人試讀英國資産階級諸重要刋物可得二結論（一）對政府印度政策奬慰有加（二）同時調侃工黨謂「社會黨主政一年今後稍知國家大計不當徒務虚聲忘却帝國之利益」更代表一切右派致謝曰「國人所懷疑懼於工黨者從此可以休矣」</p>
<p>工黨印度政策雖博得一切右派之同情但其内政成效尚乏具體表現而對於失業問題無法解决則已引起各方責難此問題對政府命運之重要或竟在印度問題之上蓋工黨當上次總選舉時除鼓吹裁减軍備外尚有一主要口號即解决失</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>業問題是也今失業人數日見增加據上星期政府報告已逹一七二○○○○人較上星期又增二七○○○人查工黨主政至本月底爲一週年在此時期内失業增六○○○○○人較以前實增加至百分之六十爲自一九二一至一九二二年貿易大衰落以來第一次空前之高率據一班推測在最短期内失業高率恐無低落之望此種現象不僅授敵黨以攻擊之口實且使勞工羣衆失望恐工黨内部糾紛亦將因之更形嚴重</p>
<p>英國工黨在ＭacDonald領導下所實行之政策往往爲左派勞工份子所詬病獨立工黨在組織上雖僅屬工黨之一分子在歷史上及精神上實爲工黨之靈魂故工黨重要領袖多出於獨立工黨但對於社會主義則獨立工黨比較爲忠實近年來兩者間常呈貌合神離之象獨立工黨之中堅如馬克士頓Ｍaxton及其同志對工黨當局之右傾深表不滿曾屢次公開抗議麥唐納之正式退出獨立工黨即其反響此次因失業問題竟至釀成内閣本身破裂之危機然工黨内閣中實無一激進份子可見勞工羣衆之怨望已不免發生影響本月二十一日内閣多數意見否决莫士箂Ｍosley等三閣員所提救濟失業之議案此草案主張政府舉債救濟失業凡六十歲以上之工人均給與休養金又主張提高强迫敎育年齡限制以減少青年工人數目内閣多數否决該案之理由爲下院方面决難通過莫士箂遂憤而辭職據一斑推測此事如無圓滿解决勞工失望日甚工黨内部糾紛恐將擴大政府在内外夾攻之下或不免下野亦未可知</p>
<p>然就記者觀察工黨政府目前似尚不至崩潰其理由爲（一）保守黨内部因保護關稅問題意見紛歧在此政策未决定前殊不利於推倒現内閣蓋自身舉棋不定若訴諸選舉必遭失敗也（二）自由黨屢經失敗自知勢孤力弱若甘作戎首逼成選舉與已無益徒犯衆怒况自由黨領袖久有要救實行比例代表制爲交換條件與工當合作之意在此交涉未進行前自不願立即倒閣（三）工黨左派份子雖不滿當局所爲但非至萬不得已時恐不肯同室操戈促成倒閣使反動勢力乘機更進</p>
<p>不過工黨政府地位之所以危險有以下三種情形如有一端發生均足使之動摇（一）若印度風雲愈趨緊急國内舊勢力又主張進一步對印度民衆施行壓迫而工黨遲疑不决保守自由兩黨將合力倒閣（二）失業繼續增加政府救濟無方民衆非難左派崛起促成黨内公開破裂（三）若因失業繼續增加政府終不得不採取近於社會主義之解决辦法致觸資産階級之怒保守黨將聯自由黨藉故倒閣如海軍條約之討論即視爲最好之資料也</p>
<p>總之英工黨政府所以釀成四面楚歌之局面其原因約有四端（一）保守黨在下議院尚不失爲一有力的反對黨故工黨不敢過攖其怒（二）自由黨時時以自由黨工黨成立協約爲餌使麥唐納少數重要領袖心旌摇摇故爲全保政權計將宣傳時政綱暫置腦後（三）失業激增羣衆怨望加以同黨時起責難聲威愈落（四）工黨政府根本弱點在旣以社會主義爲標榜又欲於現制度下委曲求全以維持政權故徘徊於應付羣衆與和緩敵黨之間而覺其困難</p>
<p>英工黨内閣如果下台工黨前途究將如何此問題須視環境變化如何而定吾人頗難預答然至少有數種趨勢可以逆料者（一）英國勞工對工黨之信仰漸見動摇（二）若無他種改進則以後工黨選舉競爭票數當較减低再起主政將較前爲難（三）印度問題發生後工黨政策右傾若長此以往黨中左派一旦博得廣大羣衆之擁護必起而作新黨運動工黨之分化恐不可免要之無論工黨政府能否渡過目前之危機工黨本身如不敢進其政策團結其同志前進殊難樂觀也（五月二十二日希明自巴黎寄）</p>

<h3>長江上游之領江工潮</h3>
<p>罷工已將半載外輪損失甚鉅</p>
<p>華輪營業轉盛美法承認加蘄</p>
<p>重慶通訊長江上游（由重慶至宜昌）領江罷工風潮至今將近半年毫無解决可能其間之種種經過頗堪注意兹就上游領江罷工之前後事實叙述如次</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<h3>接要聞</h3>
<p>自重慶宜昌開置海關以來上下各輪之領江皆須由海關考試合格後始能服務職是之故宜渝兩關所置之巡江司除固有之職責外尚兼有考試領江人才之任務而一般航行宜渝之商輪無論中外非雇用該兩關考試合格而又領有執照之領江不能行駛此種用意實因川江多險灘非熟習各灘之水勢與夫枯水洪水之航業綫者動輙遇不測之禍法至良也惟該兩關主考人物除巡江司爲首要份子外尚聘有熟習上游之老領江二人專爲巡江司考試領江之顧問歷任宜渝巡江司者均爲外人而所謂老領江者則爲華人因而華人有願業領江以謀生者輙與老領江勾通俾對語言不通之巡江司顧問時略加包涵謀生者即可領取執照服務也</p>
<p>十年前重慶關之巡江司爲英人蒲藍田（Ｐlant）對川江航情頗多精研長江上游各險灘彼曾一一親歷曾著有長篇論文詳述長江上游形勢並力主英人須練習操業領江蓋彼以爲當時中國領江固然可用萬一將來因事罷工則英國商輪必受損失無疑此種論調頗爲僑華英商注意航行上游各輪船主因而均習領江畢竟士紳之氣習太重仍以華領江爲僱傭此等領江之報酬亦係蒲藍田當年訂定其數爲大領江月薪三百元二領江月薪二百元三領江月薪一百元所謂大領江者即經巡江司考試合格而爲某輪聘請服務之正式領江也二三領江又名學習領江雖未經過考試但由大領江之介紹輪船亦得聘用惟報酬較大領江爲薄</p>
<p>自蒲藍田至今由宜渝兩關巡江司考試合格之上游領江不下數百人航行宜渝間之中外商輪僅數十隻且每隻輪船僅用合格之領江一人其餘領江非上游商輪增加不能受聘服務加以自「五卅」及「九五」以後抵制英日之聲浪頓形澎湃上游外輪因而减少失業領江遂日益衆多現在服務之少數領江所得報酬又皆爲十年前所訂定值兹薪桂米珠亦無餘資救濟同業勢不能不向僱主要求加薪以資維持</p>
<p>今年一月底宜昌之長江上游領江工會即根據上述理由向各輪船公司提出加薪要求當時擬訂之加薪辦法爲自二月份起各輪對於領江每月應各加薪五十元至明年起又每月各加五十元至第三年每月各加一百元大領江加至五百元爲止二領江加至四百元爲止三領江加至三百元爲止此外並由各輪船公司每月津貼大領江伙食費五十元二三領江各三十元各輪船公司得訊後當即多方考慮以爲領江薪金乃蒲巡江司所定領江合同尚未滿期斷不能打破定規推翻合同與其承認加薪不如辭退在職領江而另雇於是雙方堅持各不相讓上游領江罷工之風潮因而至今不可收拾當宜渝領江初謀罷工時上游之華輪爲數甚少且欲力謀航權自主故即允其所請上游之美法兩國商輪見華輪照常營業若不亟謀救濟勢必受極大損失乃脫離英日團體直接向領江工會交涉如美法兩國商輪之領江能打銷罷工即允許照將來英日兩國承認之契約加薪並津貼伙食一百二十元英日兩國商輪見美法商輪已照常營業乃允對各輪之大二三各領江每月各加薪二十五元津貼伙食則未置議宜渝領江工會對此堅不承認故至今仍無英日商輪上駛也（六月一日）</p>

<h3>要聞</h3>
<p>推行注音符號的目的（蔣夢麟）</p>
<p>推行注音符號已經由第二次全國敎育會議議决同時中央第八十八次常會也有一個决議案中央還定了三項推行的辦法</p>
<p>（一）令行各級黨部使黨部人員一體採用以增宣傳黨義上之便利</p>
<p>（二）知照國民政府令行各機關人員應一律熟記藉以因察失學民衆疾痛之助</p>
<p>（三）飭敎育部令行各級敎育機關師生皆應傳習恊力以助民衆補習敎育容易進行</p>
<p>現在敎育部已公布了一個注音符號推行委員會組織規程先由部組織一個注音符號推行委員會並且通令各地敎育行政機關也組織注音符號推行委員會以爲專事推行注音符號的幹部敎育部奉了國民政府的命令之後又着手編輯一本注音符號傳習的小册了把學習注音符號的程序和方法編成一本敎科書供給人們做學習的材料將來這本傳習小册編成後擬再請對這音很有研究發音又正確的專家來灌注音符號的留聲機片大家只憑留聲機片就可發音於學習上便利得多了</p>
<p>我們爲甚麽要積極的推行注音符號呢</p>
<p>我們大約的估計（因爲没有精確的統計可查只好說大約的估計）中國人口有四萬三千六百零九萬四千多人其中識字的人不過八千七百二十一萬八千多人約占全人口總數百分之二十其餘百分之八十就没有受敎育而不識字了敎育是立國大本識字是人生要事一個國家裏面有這多不識字的國民是何等嚴重的問題本黨秉承總理的遺敎領導政府實施訓政力求眞正民主國家的實現目前極不可緩的一步工作就是訓練人民行使四權養成人民政治能力以植憲政之基試問有這多「目不識丁」的人民如果不使他們受相當敎育四權如何可以行使民權怎能普遍何况處在今日生存競爭的時代無論求個人生存民族生存都非使個人本身民族分子先有充分的生活能力不可我們常說歐美各國如何的富如何的强要知道他們富强的原因就是他們國民受敎育的人很多據前幾年的統計德國識字的人占全人口總數有百分之九十九法國有百分之九六·五日本有百分之九五美國有百分之九二·三英國有百分之八六·五就意大利也有百分之六一·三中國只有百分之二十丨或許還不到百分之二十丨如果不發奮圖强使全國識字的人數增加增加到和歐美各國的比率差不多說句悲觀的話中國終久是歸於文演淘汰的因爲這是一個根本問題并不是我們願意說聳人聽聞的話爲了這個原故我們不能不努力於識字運動</p>
<p>我們旣要努力於識字運動我們知道中國敎育最不經濟的莫過於識字問題敎育家最攬腦汁研究的也莫過於識字問題中國文字共有四萬多字現在通用的大約有四五千字據前幾年中華敎育改進社所編的平民千字課要一年的時光纔學完本部所編的三民主義千字課供給民衆補習也要四個月的時光纔能學完通用的四五千字至少就要學兩三年了莫說時間不經濟拿中國現時社會上一般人的經濟能力來說也太不經濟了所以我們要使義務敎育能榖普及補習敎育能彀實施小學敎育能彀改進中學敎育能彀提高必定要用一種「費力少而成功大」的方法把這種識字的困難問題澈底解决我國的前輩先生也曾感覺到這個問題也曾定有注音識字的方法呌做讀若呌做直音呌做反切把一個字一個字的音注了出來帮助人們識字也有不少的力量但是没有科學的方法抅牽門類到反覺得繁複累贅不容易懂了如果用注音符號去注音只要記得四十個字母學會併音的方法那末文字旁邊注有符號一看就可以讀出音來由音會意由意識字豈不方便若是我們把一個字的兩旁左邊注了方音右邊注了國音由方音識字由字識國音豈不是讀音統一也在其中了麽在現在這種學術發達人事繁複的時一切治事的方法都要使他一天比一天簡便纔好有了這個極犀利的識字工具中國幾十年來敎育問題當中最困難的識字問題可算澈底的解决我們旣是認識字運動是目前最要緊的工作所以我們就應當努力的推行注音符號這是我們推行注音符號的意義也是我們推行注音符號的目的</p>
<p>講到這裏我們要特别提出來說的就是推行注音符號的主要目的不是統一國語而是普及識字所以敎育部於製定國音符號以外還要就各地方音製定方音的潤母符號</p>
<p>我們知道注音符號就是從前所謂的注音字母推行注音字母的運動不自今日始已經在奸幾年以前了從前初推行注音字母的時候何當不是閙得轟轟烈烈然而後來竟成（强努之未）氣息淹淹差不多没有人過問了這是甚麽緣故呢其中最大的緣故就是本末倒置把識字最利時工具誤認爲統一國語最利的工具大家努力的方向都編重在統一國語方面以爲幾十個注音字母通行全國各地不同的方音土語都可一致的說一種話同一聲音同一腔調於是大家都在所謂標準音標準語上爭辨各樹旗幟而各地學習的人因爲要摹倣標準音標準語的關係舞舌弄牙展轉相傳結果成一種「四不像」的話大家以爲失敗了所以學習國語的熱潮漸漸的冷了下來注音的方法也就無形停止信了殊不知把注音字母認爲統一國語的利器這是錯誤的一國語有一個最重要的條件就是「交通便利」如果忽略了交通便利這個條件而去求統一國語猶之乎「緣木以求魚」難有成功的希望誠然在同一個民族裏面有多少種不同的語言是最妨碍於民族的感情和團結力的今日中國語言這樣複雜的情形固然有統一之必要但是方音土語之所以成爲方音土語是有牠歷史上的關係地理上的關係絶不是一時偶然的我們要消滅方音土語應當要打破造成方音土語原因的天然隔閡要打破這種天然隔閡除了使交通便利没有第二個更有力的方法如果交通便利南方的人可以到北方去西方的人可以往東方來日子久了彼此同化語言不待統一而自然趨於一致了假使此時我們不努力於便利交通而努力於用注音字母統一國語充其量也只能行之於「普通話」流行的地方和已經識字的一個階級因爲他們已經會說普通話要敎他說和標準音一致的國語不過進一步求其好聽他們已經認識文字要敎他們讀如標準音一致的國音也不過進一步求其好聽其實這是成了「藝術化」去了於大多數不識字的是無補的吳稚暉先生講推行注音符號有一段話說</p>
<p>「我素來講穿「草鞋主義」爲甚麽鞋的功用一是保足二是跑路草鞋保定勉强可以跑路則再好没有如先生大人辦的皮鞋有價值到二三十元的其實穿到二三十元皮鞋的人在家有地氈出門有汽車名是鞋其實變成裝飾品了裝飾品可以不用有用的還是草鞋但願各位實行我的「草鞋主義」</p>
<p>吳先生這段話可以做從前一般人用注音符號專事來統一國語的一個「當頭棒」因爲現在國裏面還有百分之八十的人不曾識字不利用注音符號去敎他們識字而偏要大多數能說普通話的去說標準音的國語這豈不是只講裝飾而不講實用嗎猶之要跑路去了草鞋不穿去穿二三十元的皮鞋試問以現在敎育不普及交通不便利人民生活困難的中國還有甚麽能力去穿二三十元披鞋呢</p>
<p>但是我上面說的話並不是絶對否認推行注音符號不能統一國語論到法音符號的功用也可以統一國語不過是由注音識字的當中順便得到的一種副作用這種順便得的副作用還是要賴交通便利的物質條件然後才能收統一國語之效所以此時我們要應當打破以前「推行注音符號之目的在統一國語」的觀念把統一國語期之五十年之後現在只知道「推行注音符號的目的在識字」的一個單純的觀念一切推行的方法都準此鵠的去做方音也可以注土語可以注不一定要指定某地方的音纔是標準音某種語纔是國語總之目的是要用注音的方法使國内百分之八十的這些不識字的人能在一個短期内識字所以吳先生說</p>
<p>「如寗波人唸「我們」爲「阿拉」你給注音便在「我們」下注上「阿拉」一看就懂所以最後的口號是「我們就是阿拉」</p>
<p>固然敎寗波人認識「我們」兩個字没有吳先生說的這樣簡單但是我們不用這個方法定要用國語國音去敎向來只知道「阿拉」不知道「我們」又不識「我們」兩字的寗波人來認識「我們」兩個字眞是要寗波人先變做一個啞吧然後另換一個嗓子纔來讀「我們」說「我們」小孩子或許可以十五歲以上的恐怕就很吃力了他們仍然要說「我們說阿拉」多方便何必定說「我們」呢」那末我們只好等這般方便何必定說「我們」兩字才能在寗波通行這是何等可笑的事　所以這次我們推行注音符號應當要呌出下面的幾個口號來</p>
<p>（一）推行注音符號的目的是使不識字的人識字</p>
<p>（二）推行注音符號不是用來統一國語</p>
<p>（三）我們先使不識字的人識字由普及識字後去求國語的統一</p>

<h3>雲南苗民熊鵬</h3>
<p>年來國内戰爭邊疆僻地每不能顧及關於一切現狀旣無精確之調查而傳說記載又多失實關心邊事者殊爲遺憾日昨於某君處得雲南苗民數事頗足注意蓋雲南自片馬交涉後國人早不復記憶然其地藴藏甚豐現英伺於西法窺於南苦心經營頗多收效某君在滇年久悉苗民事甚稔苗民通常被稱爲野蠻未開化者然實不如是苗民之事有令人驚異者特國人不之察耳今拾某君言以饗讀者</p>
<p>習性慎省人種至爲複雜苗人占二分之一性誠實喜歌舞不若傳說之兇悍堅强之服從性婚期全在三月先聚男女歌舞次擇偶而婚如傳聞者</p>
<p>田畝苗人士地不能售受各有定數遇荒歉之處則全體供給之是實行士地公有者無大地主之弊較吾人爲進化焉</p>
<p>女苗甚足欽佩今雲南全省嗜阿芙蓉者幾達二分之一然男苗竟無一人胥女苗之功也其俗有未婚之男苗有芙蓉癖者則全女苗皆不屑與婚若已結婚之男苗嗜之者其妻引爲大辱必至自殺</p>
<p>敎育雲南不少學校而苗民來學者則甚尠蓋中國敎育不適其性而敎者又不能應變因之英法得乘機而起設舞場爲學校再以二十六字母併苗民言語成歌舞敎之故頗得苗民信仰苗民固富服從性者英法之用心可知</p>
<p>現在英法勢力已深入堂奥鐵路學校全力建設直視雲南爲安緬之屬是鼾睡臥榻之旁者實吾人肘腋之患國人當注意及之</p>
<h3>滂沱别紀扶風三郎</h3>
<p>予寓閘北辦公處則在外灘晨往夕返均賴電車代步惟華界一段則安步當車習以爲常非勤於運動限於經濟耳日前大雨街道盡濕滬北道路平日已屬石子頂脚不良於行一雨之後泥漿塞塗益覺步步艱難予爲經濟所限只得一手持傘一手掩衣冒雨而走踏泥而行正興難行之嘆不意摩托嗚嗚疾馳而過車輪過處泥花四濺半舊單衫已遭雨潤斑爛觸目滿衣皆是回視汽車已距數十武之遥僅見車窗中一雙錦服男女之背影而已交涉無只得自怨命蹇何以不坐汽車而步行於雨天之下耶</p>
<h3>記日人養鴿法嵇覲</h3>
<p>頃友人自東瀛歸云及日人養鴿專爲傳遞書信之用據最近調查東京區多至二萬六千四百餘隻其他如神户大阪廣島各古屋等處亦不相上下此項驚人之數目歷年增加實非吾人估計所可及兹將養鴿之法略誌大概以告閱者</p>
<p>種類之選擇鴿有白黑灰花四種而以白者爲上品其毛捱密兩目微赤項强而背闊尾短而身輕振羽飛時發有沙沙之聲騰空上下不稍停留每小時可行三十餘里實爲其他所不及每對之值約需日金五六元左右日人特闢一格以居之飼養維謹勿使與凡庸伍恐其性態上有所變更也然黑灰花三者未必盡不如白縱有傑出亦因愛憎不同祗黜居於二三等之列而已</p>
<p>訓練之設施鴿之優劣無可觀察至少生後二三月始可斷定其優者天性活潑一經訓練即能盡如人意平時除傳書外兼且敎之以種種游戲之術劣者則不然或以食誘或以威脅窮年累月不見成功日人憤怒之餘往往殺而食之不足惜也聞昔有岡吉太郎者善養鴿特爲築一餐堂警笛一鳴羣鴿紛飛入内按位就食毫不錯亂惟其中之愚魯者莫知所以每每饑餓而死事雖有趣然亦可見嚴格訓練之一斑矣</p>
<h3>浪漫瑣談雲郎</h3>
<p>英文Ｒomance之一字其意義初不若我人之所謂浪漫蓋浪漫之本意本爲反古典主義的個性的發展非有高超之造詣不足以談「浪漫」也然我國人則瑕瑜不辨方以「浪漫」爲一種惡意的名詞馴至别解如滬諺之所謂「拆爛屙」者眞「浪漫」之不幸也</p>
<p>在我國歷史上求浪漫派人物則陶濳李白等比較近似若求之紅樓夢中則浪漫之女郎非襲人而爲史湘雲也</p>
<p>余美顔亦以浪漫女子稱就其思想上評斷則略有可取處就其行動上觀察則不無失之太過</p>
<p>近聞明星影片公司新開攝一影片名「浪漫女子」以宣景琳女士主演之劇情極曲折而熱閙述一交際社會之愛情劇對於浪漫化之女子頗着重於心理上與環境間之變能的誘惑與壓迫的描寫此片中之浪漫女子最初爲一交際之花繼則爲美術學校之一女學生成一女藝術家然繼以不幸之遭逢致墜　而入大賭窟終以不勝身世之感成爲瘋人以入瘋人院其問變幻典折極盡纒綿悱惻之能事近來民風日偷此片或能於熱閙中稍寓針　也</p>
<h3>南洋游記（三○）靈花</h3>
<p>二十三日養正校長鄜維周約黃超南陳子實張登三數人出游柔佛柔佛者今爲保護國尚有國王乃一小縣之地耳人口數十萬有回敎堂此間國王名爲蘇丹皆回敎名也經過大鐵橋以渡海峽聞此橋造成千餘萬元云其國境有警吏檢視亦似一國然王宫如吾小縣署不敵吾大學校之規模聞爲吾華商黃氏所蓋我欲因黃氏訪其王及王后而王與后均朝於英倫其餘妃不能得力也按柔佛即元時之羅斛元史載其來歴彼時與爪哇同爲女兒國</p>
<p>二十四訪民黨友人據云正與當地政府交涉因英政府禁止民黨活動事此事在英屬各地民黨均受不自由之影響據英人一面議論表面上爲民黨未在政府正式立案而事實上聞係恐民黨中有念進派混人因國内大亂防有急激派相率南來借民黨以活動致妨治安若本來之國民黨一向與英政府亦無甚衝突也此或英人想當然之神經過敏耳</p>
<p>二十五友人有業當舖者忽倒閉連倒二家每家以數十萬計蓋因商業巿况不佳所致存欵於當舖者均虧折或乾没一時社會甚恐慌據在報窮司友人言昔日每年報窮之商店不過二百今年入春三個月來報窮者已三百八十將來難言也報窮司者專司商店破産之事即破産司也報告破産後即停止其個人之活動不許坐汽車不許坐頭等電車不許着白衣西俗以白衣爲上等若犯者則受偵探之處罰若欲取消此不自由則須還清舊債方可恢復雖然此亦不過法律上事而事實上常有狡者僞報破産而以財産暗與其妻子名下在法律上爲其妻子之産而他日彼人坐其妻子之汽車出行在法律上難以罰之由此以觀法律亦有窮時也</p>
<h3>志荒江女俠大石</h3>
<p>顧明道君所著荒江女俠小說銷路至廣今由友聯影片公司改編影劇日前公映於中央大戲院日告客滿良以該公司攝武俠片有令譽於時益以徐琴芳女士之文武藝術充分聚注於此以是更相得而益彰</p>
<p>荒江女俠影片之長爲不趨重時下習氣惟注重於分幕之緊凑使人觀之醰醰有餘味及亟待往後看之必要故該片兩集之營業收入二集更較首集爲佳</p>
<p>聞三四集下月亦可開映而明道尚有續著則續續出下去當益極端受人之歡迎也</p>
<p>影片中之武術或可假借而舞台上之眞刀槍互鬥則非眞功夫不辦徐女士與尚冠武在天然劇中刀劍鏗鏘互戰時之神態誠有龍驤虎躍氣概但苟一不愼傷創立致女士等非有眞賓功夫烏能臻此是以觀衆莫不加以贊許而布景之偪眞童樂之佳妙猶其餘事也</p>

<p>總理廣州蒙難八週紀</p>
<h3>念應有的認識</h3>
<p>（一）民十一年夏總理由廣西移師北伐次於桂林陳逆炯明恐革命成功不便於個人之企圖乃勾結北方軍閥盡力阻撓破壞總理返粤坐鎭廣州陳逆竟稱兵叛亂遂致總理蒙難廣州歴時五十餘日</p>
<p>（二）總理旣發覺陳逆部隊進逼總統府猶不肯輕離職守欲以死殉國迨身處亂軍中仍復置生死於度外從容不迫徒步登艦指揮士卒躬冒鋒鏑計劃戡亂工作此種革命的大無畏精神實爲同志同胞奮鬥的典型</p>
<p>（三）經此事變後舉國同胞更深仰總理的偉大深信總理的主義及方略爲拯民救國的寶筏咸翕然傾向革命贊助本黨而本黨同志更各自奮勇努力革命故終能剷除叛逆統一全國要皆總理蒙難精神之所感召</p>
<p>（四）紀念總理蒙難廣州我們更知道假革命者終必流於反革命反革命終必爲革命勢力所殲滅比觀於昔年陳逆與楊劉等逆之敗亡及年來桂系張唐等軍閥之顚撲皆歴歴不爽此次闓馮諸逆叛亂與陳逆桂系前後若出一轍經我中央軍之撻伐即土崩瓦解亦不能逃出覆亡的前例於此可見革命的武力是無往而不勝利的</p>
<p>（五）紀念總理蒙難廣州應該奮起總理堅苦卓絶的精神戮身肅清一切反動餘孽尤應一致竭誠擁護中央擁護總理忠實信徒勞苦功高革命領袖蔣主席以鞏固强有力的中央政府庶可以策進訓政永弭叛逆杜絶内亂以禦外侮</p>
<p>告民衆書誰都知道國民革命之目的在求中國之自由平等爲欲求其目的之達到必須掃除一切革命之障礙換言之不外革命者和反革命者的鬥爭總理致力國民革命凡四十年其中的經過就是一部和反革命者奮鬥的革命的光榮的歷史反過來說總理歷史的背景就是遭一切反革命者的種種襲擊和陷害八年前的今日就是總理在廣州被反革命者陳逆炯明襲擊的一天也就是總理革命史上最光榮最警心動魄的一頁當民國十一年夏總理整兵桂林長驅北伐之時陳逆炯明已懷不軌及總理回師攻贛陳逆叛亂更爲顯明至六月十六日陳逆竟敢統率逆軍包圍總統府砲擊觀音山並將總理積數十年心血所著的三民主義及其他關於革命之著述統統付之一炬察其用意實欲得總理而甘心幸有本黨蔣介石同志等環護在側出死入生得免於難吾人於此應知陳逆炯明固屬忘恩負義摧殘革命毫無心肝之蟊賊即執而誅之亦屬死有餘辜而現在類乎陳逆炯明之蟊賊環顧國中還不知多少即如現在北洋殘餘軍閥閣錫山馮玉祥李宗仁白崇禧張發奎等之倡亂叛變和年前的情景可謂殊途同歸如出一轍因此我們在今天要認清這些叛亂的反革命者軍閥我們絶對不能與之通融我們如果不把這些叛變的殘餘軍閥根本肅清則國民革命永遠不會成功因此吾人必當機續總理大無畏的革命精神在中央領導之下共同努力撲滅一切叛亂則我們今天的紀念才有意義才有價值革命的民衆們努力吧我們的口號是擁護蔣總司令戡定一切叛亂實行三民主義完成國民革命</p>
<p>告同志書各位同志應該記得今天是我們總理在廣州蒙難的八週紀念是陳逆炯明叛黨禍國的慘痛日子同時也是叛徒自掘墳墓自取滅亡之實現的一天歷史告訴我們凡是背叛叛本黨就是北叛全國民衆的要求結果一定是自取滅亡的我們看民國十一年年陳炯明做了軍政部長獨掌大權擁兵十萬縱横兩粤簡直不可一世當時包圍總統府砲擊觀音山形勢的嚴重誠是到了萬分但是結果陳逆炯明不過是自速其滅亡罷了革命原是一件非常的事業在革命的進程中必然的有許多艱險困苦的事情發生我們原不足悲嘆亦不應灰心總理從事革命四十年苦心孤詣失敗者不下十餘次之多不過在這十餘次的失敗都是與革命的對象帝國主義腐敗的滿清政府等奮鬭而這次的不幸事件發生却是跟隨總理有十餘年歷史的黨員陳炯明的叛黨這實在令人痛心萬分的然而陳炯明的敢悍然不顧公然叛黨也不是偶然的根本原因在於缺少黨的訓練因爲陳炯明對於總理的人格没有深刻的認識對於總理的主義没有澈底的了解他跟隨總理不是爲主義奮鬭不是爲救中國奮鬭他正如從前一班草野英雄想附鳳從龍以達到他割據的野心兩廣皇帝的痴夢假使陳炯明對於總理的人格有得切實的認識對於總理的主義有澈底的了解那末他一定不肯做這種叛黨禍國的罪人所以我們覺得没有黨的嚴密組織黨的切實訓練黨内的危險隨時有發生的可能總理逝世後陳炯明第二的唐生智以及桂系白崇禧李宗仁等又相繼叛變了現在閻錫山馮玉祥等也公然反叛中央使整個的黨蒙了難同時西北的民衆也蒙了大難黨内一個個的反叛份子如此之多使軍事不能結束民衆的痛苦不能解除這種責任當然在於我們全體的同志身上我們要想早日完成革命的大業必須當内没有這種反叛份子發生使訓政得以順利進行那末我們應該怎樣的負起責任來共同來撲滅本黨的一切敵人同時注意於黨的訓練工作使黨内不再有反叛份子發生我們痛念過往目擊現在黨的環境如此惡劣帝國主義眼睜睜的切望本黨天亡革命中斷新舊軍閥官僚政客焚香祝禱的期望本黨消滅革命失敗投機份子假革命者只想假借本黨照牌而發展其個人主義擴大其封建勢力我們在這惡劣的環境中應該切實團結一致共同努力從速撲滅叛黨禍國的閻錫山馮玉祥護黨救中國同志們誰都負有一分責任視大家努力吧中國國民黨上海特别巿執行委員會</p>

<p>曁南師範科和初中部</p>
<h3>圖畫展覽會</h3>
<p>我們曁南的展覽會可算是不少大都是關於學術上的技能上的往往到了學期結束時候或是開始的時期把成績來獻給敎職員同學們欣賞</p>
<p>現在曁南的師範科和初中部的二個展覽會都是開幕了從十五日到十七日完畢内部的畫品有水彩畫木炭畫以及其他手工的作品有銅鐵類膠製木製竹製等等的東西很是優美</p>
<p>我們謹以至誠地希望曁大的師範科初中部同學們努力前進造成一個藝術化的學府吧（安）</p>
<h3>獻給愛好演劇的女同學</h3>
<p>民國十九年顯然是個戲劇的年頭了（今年却是比從前興盛得多了）劇社的産生可說是正如雨後春筍般地不斷地繼續着休說各大學裏的組織劇社狂在報紙時有所見就連中學女學也似受了莫大影響般地在忙着演戲或也可說是患了戲劇的傳染症這半年來公演的戲劇例如戲劇協社的「威尼斯商人」辛酉劇社的「文舅舅」「狗的跳舞」和「桃花源」以及正在演着的南國的「卡門」又聞本月十七日有復旦劇社的公演二十日又有戲劇協社的公演還有未來的未來其它的其它這是不可推測的至於各大學裏劇社的表演那更不勝枚舉了</p>
<p>藝術是鼓勵民族奮發底精神的在這民族性一天萎靡似一天的中國應該用藝術的力量來做民族運動的先驅青年們應該負起這個責任的</p>
<p>一部分比較覺悟的青年他們努力從了戲劇運動如今已達到這種的成績却不能不歸功於他們的尤其是使得一班小姐們從閨房裏或課堂裏一脚而跨上戲劇的舞臺這是很難得的事</p>
<p>但近年來的一部分幹戲劇運動的人似乎轉了一面方向這一部份人的做戲背後似乎有黑暗而險惡的影了在龍照着關於他們現在姑且不加一辭惟不得已於言者就是一班女演員受好戲劇的女同學好們十之八九都是純樸天眞的小天使社會的環境丨丨一切黑暗險惡奸巧欺詐什麽也未嘗過她們只知爲藝術而藝術愛做戲而做戲她們在演戲之先並不對於戲本的用意加以研究或考慮好們祇有柔和的依從呌好們演什麽好們就演什麽叫她們喊什麽就喊什麽所吱唔者惟有在主角席位相爭執比較出色漂亮點的女土獲得了主角席位後什麽也没有話講了（並非侮辱女性這是事實昭示我們的）好們這樣受了矇藥似的迷入五里霧中受了隂影的籠照怎不可惜</p>
<p>小姐們請你們在加入公演以前自已先考慮審察一下吧這是最重要的事旁觀者不得已於言的（美）</p>
<h3>曁大體育的發展</h3>
<p>現在在國内外誰不知道上海西鄕有國立曁南大學嗎而牠站在體育上有怎樣的光榮我們有眼可見的了牠是頂瓜瓜的一間國立大學牠自從國民政府建都南京以後就順着潮流的進步而進步在科學建設體育的發展都是特殊的進步啊老實的說實在比各大學進步得多了在科學建設上都上那一幢幢的洋房可以證明了而在體育一方面特出一種風味也足見曁校的努力</p>
<p>最近的過去有敎育學院的師生聯合運動會從五月初旬到末才結束分足球籃球排球網球及田徑賽及男女田徑游藝比賽都是十二分的熱烈奮鬭得到最後良好的結果在報章上已看個明白了</p>
<p>又在最近一兩日的事有華僑學生自動組織一個運動的名稱爲「南洋馬來半島華校旅滬同學體育聯合會」是由養正尊孔兩學校同學發起共同組織的其他同島各校同學都在徵求中但是因爲太散漫的緣故似難有負責召集之人一時難有成軍之可能故所以不能參加此會如星加坡鼎鼎有名的華僑中學的同學旅滬人數最多而其體育亦不弱於養尊兩校同學之下一時亦難以參加甚爲可惜現在只有養正尊孔兩校同學分别舉行之種類分足球籃球排球（本定十三日因下雨延期）網球田徑賽越野賽跑在本月十四日下午一時起舉行田徑賽而兩校同學在母校原都是一二流之人才那此日定有一番熱烈的競爭又探聞得兩校同學負責人已向學校（曁校）校長校職員等募集奬品甚多而向母校徵得的校董奬品亦是不少</p>
<p>作者所知道的養正人材略評如下如羅榮標陸康賢陳福携林九鴻林和樂陳錦順陳觀清都是在曁大體育欄上一二流人材也但是尊孔的舊同學亦是不弱的如羅海光陳行佩楊㶧元趙伯歡吳榮銓陳永聰亦是代表席上一二流人材也最使人注意者是陳君行佩他曾打破全國的一千五百米及三千米的紀錄而吳榮銓有尊孔劉長春之號稱尤其是那位美沙年羅海光的足球籃球久負盛名這次可說羣英大會這種的努力盛舉也是國内各大學罕見之事也是因爲這次遠東運動會失敗後剌激之中國一般青年所以特殊的努力爲準備將來雪恥之用也（容金）</p>

<h3>巴爾紥克八十年紀念</h3>
<p>法國文壇寫實派之祖的巴爾紥克（HonoredeBalzac）生於一七九九年卒於一八五○年今年是一九三○年所以巴爾紥克逝世後整整的八十年了</p>
<p>文學家的偉大是無可認識的因此我們對於巴爾紥克應該要表示他的八十年紀念」</p>
<p>說起來很可憐嗜好文學的我對於巴爾紥克的認識不過是兩年以前我初次讀他的他品不是長篇的而是短篇的雖然長篇小說尤其是他的特色兩年前我是不讀法文的所以讀的是「近代叢書」的英譯本丨巴爾紥克短篇小說集（ShortSoriesHoncredeBalzac）關於巴爾紥克在這部小說集的封面上「近代對書」的編者說</p>
<p>巴爾紥克是一個短篇小說家如他是長篇小說家一樣但是不知道什麽緣故他的較短的小說在英文裏所見很少如他的較大的作品一樣牠們有生動與一目了然結搆方面是巧妙的叙事方面是入情入理的就是這幾篇短篇小說「足以表明巴爾紥克意想的創造靈敏的天資精明的觀察正確心理的與生理的知識」</p>
<p>對於没有機會認識巴爾紥克較大作品的讀者們就是這幾篇小說也足夠解釋巴爾紥克得到世界最著名文學家之一的地位的原因了</p>
<p>從幾位有志研究文學的友人談話結果我們承認英譯的法國小說丨長篇或短篇丨往往比英文的原板小說有味巴爾紥克的自然也是如此雖然一位著「法國文學史」的英國人說法國没有最大的文豪如英之沙氏比亞但是法國享有世界大名的文學家是不乏其人的富於情感的法國人他們的文學寓在是春天的花園令人生愛</p>
<p>巴爾紥克一生共寫了九十七本的長篇小說不談質的方面即以量而言也足以驚人了自然這不是没有文學天才的人所能做得到</p>
<p>自來有天才的人最歡喜幹他具有天才能力的事項羽學書學劍都不願但是學萬人敵就高興起來了巴爾紥克是富有文學天才的所以終身幹文學事業耐窮耐苦繼續不斷的努力他要做個文學家没有事能夠叫他改變方針</p>
<p>好似一條不易的定律文人總是窮的多我記得富蘭克林學做詩的時候他家中人勸他不要幹這無聊的事說「做詩者常常是叫化子」（VerseMakersareUsuallybeggars）巴爾紥克的家中人也有同樣的思想但是環境雖然如此而天才終不可以埋没巴爾紥克的愛妹MadamedeSurville告訴我們說「在孩童的時代他已經藝術家似的讚嘆都爾（巴爾紥克的故鄕）的美景他有時高興的立在日落的景象中不聲不響的享受天然」愛美的觀念在巴爾紥克的幼時已漸漸的露出來了</p>
<p>抱有「眞正文學的努力是最高貴的目的」主張巴爾紥克如此的做去他的家庭祇好聽他去了他的母親是愛他的也就無法了於是他走上文學之路</p>
<p>在當日賣文糊口比現在難得多因此我們可以想到巴爾紥克生活的苦了他的初期作品可以用他自已寫給他的妹妹的信上所說的</p>
<p>「我寄給你兩本新書牠們仍然不行絶少文學意味有一本你或覺得有些可笑的事與可笑的人物但是情節惡劣」</p>
<p>因爲他的不自滿所以巴爾紥克的作品改而又改常常的改到十幾次完全把初稿改没有了關於這一點很可以爲我們有志文學的人取法我們不宜以爲自已是出口成章下筆爲文的天才世界上偉大的作品决不是最短期中産出的日本的小泉八雲說過「我們的以歡喜古代遺下的歌謡是因爲牠們由千萬人唱過由千萬人改過」巴爾紥克的起首句語也是很仔細的想了半天纔動筆</p>
<p>雖然這樣說巴爾紮克决不是無能的作者他的寫作能力决不是平凡的人所能及的＂ＬeSecretdesRuggieri＂只一夜寫成＂LaVieilleFille＂祇費了三夜的工夫甚至於在幾個鐘頭以内寫了長而有價值的作品</p>
<p>閱者一定是很欲知巴爾紮克的支配時間罷在他的給ＭadameＺulmaＣarraud的信裏他說</p>
<p>「我要告訴你我沉入一種不知覺的工作裏我的生活是機械式的改變我睡覺如同家禽一樣在晚上的六點鐘或七點鐘在早晨的一點鐘我就醒了於是工作到八點在八點的時候我睡一個半鐘頭以後吃點東西一杯清珈琲整理我的自備車我接見賓客我洗浴我外出吃過午飯以後我睡覺收獲極慢負債的事又是鐵面無私而化不去現在我相信來日必發達」</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Mexico to Convene a World Conference</h3>
<p>The primary reason for the global silver crisis is the increasing silver production and decreasing demand in recent years. This is a universally acknowledged fact. Although addressing this crisis is a shared responsibility for all nations, the responsibility of silver-producing nations is particularly significant. The power to regulate production lies solely with the silver-producing nations.</p>
<p>The Mexican President's proposal to convene a world conference, gathering representatives from silver-producing and silver-using countries to discuss the issue, is crucial. The participation of major silver mine owners from the United States and Canada is particularly anticipated. However, issues of conflicting interests often prevent nations from sacrificing their own interests to mitigate harm to the global majority. For instance, recent foreign dispatches indicate that Mexican silver mine merchants believe the sole solution lies in promoting silver sales to the silverware manufacturing industry, rather than temporarily suspending silver mining. In reality, the demand for silver in arts and crafts is limited. If silver production continues to increase and arts and crafts serve as the sole outlet, it will be impossible to accommodate the excess. Furthermore, it is argued that the majority of silver production is a byproduct of copper and lead mining. Merely suspending silver mining would not sufficiently limit the increase in silver production; it would also be necessary to suspend copper and lead mining. This reveals a reluctance to suspend silver mining to sacrifice the interests of silver mine merchants. However, silver mining does account for a significant portion of silver production. If silver-producing nations like the United States, Canada, and Mexico could reasonably limit the number of silver mines, it would undoubtedly benefit the current silver market.</p>
<p>The current silver crisis is a result of nations competing to sell useless silver to China, resulting in significant harm to China. However, ultimately, no nation has benefited. Amidst this downward spiral, even nations using gold should cooperate to find a remedy. It is shortsighted for nations to view this issue as solely China's problem, unrelated to their own interests, or even to claim that China is solely responsible for the chaos in the Chinese silver market.</p>

<h3>New US Tariff Act</h3>
<p>About to be Approved and Implemented</p>
<p>Passed by a Majority in the House of Representatives Yesterday</p>
<p>Detrimental to Our Country's Exports to the US</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Washington, 14th) The tariff bill was passed by the House of Representatives today after a brief debate, with 222 votes in favor and 153 against. It is now expected that President Hoover will approve the bill before the 21st of this month, and it will take effect at midnight on that day. Under the new tariff, the tax rates are: sugar and chemicals, 31.07%; woodenware, 15.65%; linen fabrics, 19.14%; silk fabrics, 59.13%; rayon fabrics, 53.62%; tobacco and tobacco products, 64.78%. The bill also stipulates that three kinds of fresh fish, including white fish, are tax-exempt, which will greatly benefit fishermen in Honolulu and Japan. Exporters say that some goods in Sino-US trade are still tax-exempt, but the number is limited. The increased tariffs on other goods are not remarkably high. Silk thread remains tax-exempt. Wool and camel hair for weaving carpets are tax-exempt if stored in customs warehouses pending sale. Carpets woven within three years will still be taxed. The tax on raw wool has been changed from 31 cents to 34 cents. Several other items, such as eggs, tungsten, peanuts, silk thread (taxed at 40 to 50 cents per pound), and waste silk clothing, have had their tariff rates revised by the committee, which is particularly detrimental to China.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 14th) The tariff bill approved by the House of Representatives this afternoon includes 887 items with increased tariffs, 235 items with decreased tariffs, 75 items that are currently taxed but will be tax-exempt in the future, and 48 items that are currently tax-exempt but will be taxed in the future, including long-staple cotton, leather, and boots and shoes.</p>

<h3>Intensively Policing Hotels</h3>
<p>Round Table Conference is in Preparation</p>
<p>(Reuters, Bombay, 14th) Gandhi's followers intensified their policing of hotels today more thoroughly than yesterday. People are policing all 160 hotels in the textile factory area, and 40 militiamen are divided into four groups, going back and forth to persuade people to abstain from alcohol. The police did not interfere, and no one patronized the hotels.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Simla, 14th) Preparations for the Round Table Conference are currently underway. A tentative list has already been drafted, and it is estimated that about 40 to 50 people will attend. It is reported that the conference is entirely unconstrained. Although documents such as the Simon Commission report are available for reference, the conference is not limited by these documents.</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister of the Army Decides to Remain in Office</h3>
<p>Government Repeatedly Urged Him to Stay</p>
<p>Criticism from All Sides Continues</p>
<p>(Japanese United News Agency, Tokyo, 15th) The Minister of the Army submitted his resignation yesterday through Secretary Suzuki, but the secretary refused it. Then, Vice-Minister Mizoguchi delivered it to the Prime Minister, but the Prime Minister also refused to accept it. After Mizoguchi resigned, the Prime Minister consulted with Minister of Railways Eguchi. As a result, Minister Eguchi was dispatched to meet with the Minister of the Army, earnestly requesting him to remain in office, and stating that Vice-Minister Abe would be specially appointed as Acting Minister to take charge of army affairs. The Minister of the Army then consulted with Generals Kanaya and Muto regarding the aftermath. At 9:30 PM, Vice-Minister Abe was sent to the Prime Minister's official residence to inquire about the Prime Minister's true intentions. The Prime Minister also earnestly requested him to remain in office. Therefore, the Minister of the Army decided to remain in office, leaving the issue of his own advancement and retreat and the establishment of an acting minister entirely to the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>(Japanese United News Agency, Tokyo, 15th) The political reasons for the government's decision to have the Minister of the Army remain in office are as follows: (1) Many elders opposed the Minister of the Army's resignation, and Prime Minister Hamaguchi earnestly hoped that Minister of the Army Ugaki would be a member of the cabinet. (2) Among the ten major policies announced by the government when it formed the cabinet, the military reform item would be extremely difficult to implement without Minister Ugaki's means. (3) If the Minister of the Army resigned after the dispute between the government and the navy, it was feared that it would be exploited by the opposition party.</p>
<p>(Japanese United News Agency, Tokyo, 15th) Within the Ministry of the Army, there is much criticism of the Minister of the Army's remaining in office. It is said that although the Minister of the Army had Vice-Minister Mizoguchi negotiate with General Minami to succeed him as Minister of the Army, he now decided to remain in office due to personal considerations, establishing a nominal acting minister. Such actions should not occur during this critical moment for the army.</p>
<p>(Den-tsu News Agency, Tokyo, 15th) The Seiyukai party heavily criticized the government for retaining Minister of the Army Ugaki and establishing a Minister Without Portfolio as Acting Minister of the Army, stating that such measures were tantamount to allowing the Minister of the Army to be absent from his post. The government's desperate efforts to retain the Minister of the Army must conceal unspeakable secrets. The Hamaguchi cabinet, which advocates political transparency, has resorted to such cowardly means to temporarily cover up the situation, intending to deceive the people, which is extremely strange. There is also much criticism in the Diet, stating that the government is only concerned with immediate gains and losses, creating a new precedent of establishing a vice-minister as a minister without portfolio, which will leave future troubles.</p>

<h3>Labor Government's Future</h3>
<p>(European Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(1) Naval Conference (2) Indian Policy</p>
<p>(3) Unemployment Problem (4) Future of the Labor Party</p>
<p>At a time when fascism is spreading everywhere, among the governments of old-fashioned European powers, the British Labor Cabinet is relatively progressive and claims to represent the laboring masses. Therefore, its present and future are most worthy of attention, as one can glimpse the advancement or regression of the world's political situation through this one aspect. However, when we try to study the policies and position of the British Labor government, we cannot help but feel that its future is bleak.</p>
<p>What is the Labor government's position? The situation in Parliament best illustrates it. The government party has suffered repeated defeats in the House of Lords in recent months, which, according to the British political system, is originally insignificant. However, in this time of internal and external turmoil, it inevitably further damages the government's prestige. But the House of Commons is where the cabinet's survival lies, and recently, the situation for the government there has become increasingly unfavorable, which is a matter of great concern. When the coal industry bill was debated in the House of Commons, the Labor Party's position was already unfavorable. On the 20th of this month, Conservative Party members, citing the increasing number of unemployed and the government's inability to remedy the situation, proposed a motion of impeachment against the responsible cabinet member, J.H. Thomas (in the form of a proposal to reduce his salary). The government side only managed to maintain a majority of 15 votes. This was because Liberal Party members abstained from voting to show their neutrality, while 15 Labor Party members also abstained from voting to express their dissatisfaction with their own party's government. Such a situation is rarely seen in the history of British political parties.</p>
<p>As for the Labor Cabinet's policies, the most concrete manifestation is in the diplomatic field. One of the major policies advocated by the Labor Party in the last general election was to limit armaments in order to achieve world peace. The London Naval Conference this spring was the result of the diplomacy of the British Labor authorities. The naval treaty stipulated that the UK, US, and Japan would achieve a compromise of relative limitations on their navies, which must be credited to the efforts of the Labor Party. However, the Conservative Party leader deeply dissatisfied with the London Treaty, and the two points of his fiercest attacks were: (1) Regarding the provisions for cruisers, the UK admitted that its minimum requirement was only 50 ships. (2) The replacement of British cruisers with new ships was limited to 9,100 tons until 1936. The opposition party believed that this treaty nominally affirmed equality between the UK and the US, but in reality, the UK was falling behind, endangering the country's peace and showing weakness to others. When the treaty is submitted to the House of Commons for approval in the future, problems may be unavoidable. In all fairness, the results of the Naval Conference reduced the chances of conflict between the UK and the US, which should be a fortunate thing for the people of both countries. As far as the UK is concerned, its economic situation does not allow it to compete with the US in naval power (this treaty can reduce the UK's burden by 56 million pounds between 1930 and 1936). Therefore, is it not inevitable that maritime hegemony will be shared with the US? As for the conflict between France and Italy, which has become increasingly apparent due to the Naval Conference, it is sufficient to demonstrate the contradictions of imperialism itself. The root cause is still in the socio-economic system. Can the London Conference really eliminate war?</p>
<p>The British Labor Party's diplomatic policy, while willing to concede to strong countries like the US and Japan, uses traditional British methods against small and weak nations like Egypt and Palestine. (1) Since Palestine was entrusted to the UK by the League of Nations, the conflict between Arabs and Jews has intensified. After the events of last August, British officials increasingly implemented high-pressure tactics and promoted Jewish immigration to the area in order to control the Arabs. Recently, an Arab delegation went to London to petition for restrictions on immigration, the preservation of land, and the promulgation of a constitution, but all were rejected. (2) An Egyptian delegation came to the UK to negotiate the revision of the old treaty, the recovery of complete sovereignty over Sudan, and to discuss the withdrawal of British troops and the settlement of the Suez Canal management rights. The two sides insisted on their own positions, and the negotiations broke down. However, world public opinion is truly sympathetic to Egypt in most cases.</p>
<p>The most thorny issue currently facing the Labor government is the Indian problem, and what international public opinion is most concerned about is also the Indian problem. The Indian independence movement did not begin today, and it has been carried out with particular force since the Great War. The British side has always responded with force and empty words, and has used internal strife among Indians to avoid making concessions. However, this major outbreak coincided with the Labor Party being in power. The Indian masses originally thought that the attitude of the London authorities would be fairer than before. Unexpectedly, from the non-cooperation movement to the civil disobedience movement, the Governor-General of India implemented a policy of destruction. All areas with enthusiastic movements, such as Delhi, Calcutta, and Peshawar, experienced tragedies, with thousands of people killed and injured. Those arrested filled the prisons. After Gandhi was arrested, succeeding leaders such as the 80-year-old Abbas Tyabji and the highly renowned female poet Mrs. Naidu were also arrested and imprisoned one after another. At the same time, the publication of assemblies was banned, and gunboats and aircraft went out to demonstrate. Although all these facts came from the hand of the Governor-General of India, the highest responsible party was actually the government in London. However, the Labor authorities still chanted high about "round table conferences" and "Simon reports," etc. Their attitude was completely opposite to when they attacked the Conservative Party when they were in opposition a year ago. It is no wonder that the Labor Party's left wing protested from time to time. On the other hand, both the Conservative and Liberal parties readily expressed their sympathy for the Labor Party's Indian policy. When we try to read the important publications of the British bourgeoisie, we can come to two conclusions: (1) There is increased praise and consolation for the government's Indian policy. (2) At the same time, the Labor Party is ridiculed, saying, "The Socialist Party has been in power for a year, and from now on, it will know a little about the overall national plan, and it should not merely pursue empty claims and forget the interests of the empire." Further representing all right-wing parties, they offered thanks, saying, "The fears that the people had about the Labor Party can now be put to rest."</p>
<p>Although the Labor Party's Indian policy has won the sympathy of all right-wing parties, its domestic achievements still lack concrete manifestations, and the failure to solve the unemployment problem has aroused criticism from all sides. The importance of this problem to the fate of the government may even be above the Indian problem. This is because when the Labor Party won the last general election, in addition to advocating disarmament, there was also a major slogan: solving unemployment.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>The number of unemployed is increasing day by day. According to the government report last week, it has reached 1,720,000, an increase of 27,000 over last week. The Labor Party has been in power for one year by the end of this month. During this period, unemployment has increased by 600,000, an increase of 60% compared to before, which is the highest rate ever since the great trade recession from 1921 to 1922. According to a group of estimates, the high unemployment rate is unlikely to fall in the shortest period of time. This phenomenon not only gives the enemy party an excuse to attack, but also disappoints the laboring masses, and it is feared that internal disputes within the Labor Party will also become more serious as a result.</p>
<p>The policies implemented by the British Labor Party under the leadership of MacDonald are often criticized by left-wing labor elements. The Independent Labor Party, although only a member of the Labor Party in terms of organization, is actually the soul of the Labor Party in terms of history and spirit. Therefore, many important leaders of the Labor Party come from the Independent Labor Party. However, the Independent Labor Party is more loyal to socialism. In recent years, there has often been a superficial agreement but inner discord between the two. The backbone of the Independent Labor Party, such as Maxton and his comrades, have expressed deep dissatisfaction with the Labor Party authorities' right-leaning policies and have repeatedly publicly protested. MacDonald's official withdrawal from the Independent Labor Party is a reaction to this. This time, the unemployment problem has actually led to a crisis of the cabinet itself breaking apart. However, there is actually not a single radical element in the Labor Cabinet, which shows that the resentment of the laboring masses has inevitably begun to have an impact. On the 21st of this month, the majority opinion of the cabinet rejected the proposal to relieve unemployment proposed by three cabinet members, Mosley, etc. This draft proposed that the government borrow money to relieve unemployment, and that all workers over the age of 60 should be given retirement pay. It also proposed raising the age limit for compulsory education to reduce the number of young workers. The majority of the cabinet rejected the proposal on the grounds that it would be difficult to pass it in the House of Commons. Therefore, Mosley resigned in anger. According to a group of estimates, if this matter is not resolved satisfactorily, the disappointment of the laborers will increase day by day, and the internal disputes within the Labor Party will likely expand. The government may inevitably step down under the attack from both inside and outside.</p>
<p>However, according to the reporter's observation, the Labor government does not seem to be on the verge of collapse at the moment. The reasons are: (1) The Conservative Party is still a powerful opposition party in the House of Commons, so the Labor Party does not dare to provoke its anger too much. (2) The Liberal Party has repeatedly used the establishment of an agreement between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party as bait, causing a few important leaders of MacDonald to waver, so for the sake of the full protection of political power, they have temporarily put the platform they had when campaigning behind them. (3) Unemployment has increased sharply, and the resentment of the masses has been added to by the voices of criticism from within the party from time to time, and its prestige has fallen more and more. (4) The fundamental weakness of the Labor government is that it advocates socialism and also wants to compromise and seek complete victory under the current system in order to maintain political power, so it hesitates between coping with the masses and appeasing the enemy party, and feels that it is difficult.</p>
<p>If the British Labor Cabinet steps down, what will be the future of the Labor Party? This question must depend on how the environment changes, and it is quite difficult for us to predict. However, at least there are several trends that can be anticipated: (1) The faith of British laborers in the Labor Party is gradually wavering. (2) If there are no other improvements, then the number of votes in future Labor Party election competitions will be reduced, and it will be more difficult to regain power than before. (3) After the Indian problem occurred, the Labor Party's policy leaned to the right. If this continues, the left wing of the party, once it wins the support of a broad mass of people, will inevitably rise up and launch a new party movement, and the division of the Labor Party may be unavoidable. In short, regardless of whether the Labor government can survive the current crisis, it is difficult to be optimistic about the Labor Party itself if it does not dare to advance its policies, unite its comrades, and move forward.

<p>Under the Dawes Plan</p>
<h3>Final Report on Reparations Published</h3>
<p>8,000 Trillion Gold Marks Paid Out in Five Years</p>
<p>The German Government's Economic Burden is Increasing</p>
<p>(Reuters, Berlin, 14th) The general manager of reparations under the Dawes Plan, Mr. Gilbert, published the final report on reparations, which is as long as an ordinary novel. Its conclusion reads: "The reparations have been paid in full, totaling 8,000 trillion gold marks in five years. However, there has been waste in Germany's public utilities, resulting in frequent budget deficits. Therefore, at this time when there is an urgent need to freely adjust the country to cope with the current global financial recession, its economic burden is increasing." The report also stated that after the implementation of the Young Plan, the first problem for the German government and its people is the reform of public finances.</p>
<h3>Prelude to the US Embassy's Move South</h3>
<p>Johnson Writes to the Secretary of State, Advocating a Move to Shanghai</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Washington, 14th) Secretary of State Stimson received a letter today from the newly appointed US Ambassador Johnson, advocating that the US Embassy be moved from Peiping to Shanghai. After receiving the letter, Secretary Stimson told people that he could not make a decision on this issue for the time being, and that he intended to conduct further investigations into the current situation. However, according to those who know Secretary Stimson well, he is deeply concerned that if the US Embassy remains in Peiping for a long time, there may be many obstacles with the National Government, and it is also difficult to justify it in terms of diplomatic relations. Ambassador Johnson's letter stated that Shanghai is the center of business, and that moving the embassy there would be very convenient for handling affairs. As for Nanking, it is still difficult to say for sure whether it can be China's permanent political center. Many government officials also deeply agree with Johnson's plan, saying that if the US Embassy can be moved to Shanghai, the existing US Marine Corps security detachment can be withdrawn, and the funds for this security detachment can be transferred to cover the moving expenses, with plenty left over.</p>

<p>Wooden Blocks and Spittoons Flew Together</p>
<p>Twenty Students Injured</p>
<p>(Den-tsu News Agency, Tokyo, 15th) More than 800 students of the preparatory course at Nihon University have been on strike since the end of last month. At 6 PM last night, in order to demand a final response from the school, they marched to the school and pushed open the iron gates to invade the campus. The school threw down wooden blocks and spittoons from the windows upstairs. As a result, twenty students were slightly injured. The students then rushed into the staff room and smashed the equipment and glass windows one by one. After the police rushed to suppress the situation, the uproar finally subsided.</p>
<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Minyuan Appeals for Relief</p>
<p>To the Shanghai Shenbao Newspaper Office:</p>
<p>I have just received a letter from Minyuan appealing for relief, which states: "Minyuan is unfortunately suffering from an unprecedented famine, and disasters are frequent. It is a living hell. However, the outside world is mostly unclear about the details. I respectfully explain them to our fellow countrymen and charitable organizations throughout the country, as well as to contemporary benevolent people. Our county was thoroughly ransacked after Song's army besieged the city in the 15th year, and the towns and cities were completely destroyed. The wheat was not harvested in the autumn. In the 16th year, the wheat was not harvested, and the autumn harvest was meager. In the early summer of the 17th year, there was again a bandit raid. Only 20 to 30% of the wheat was harvested. After that, a severe drought began. The disaster became apparent after August and September, and more and more people died. In the 18th year, not a single grain was obtained. Corpses littered the streets in the city, and they could not be buried in time. The villages outside the city were reduced to ruins, and the starved corpses filled the fields. Grass roots and tree bark were dug up and eaten completely. Worn belts and broken houses were destroyed and sold. Even bones were exchanged for firewood. People and animals ate each other. Many women were sold out of the pass and became trapped in a living hell. The weak committed suicide in despair. The fierce formed gangs and robbed graves and people, so that robberies were stacked in the fields and white bones were scattered. Last winter's heavy snow was exceptionally cold, and people were frozen and starved. Corpses lay in the snow in piles. Since the beginning of this spring, it has become even more tragic. It is hoped that it will rain and there will be a harvest elsewhere, but the three counties are still a barren land. Countless hungry ghosts are now in the season when new crops are not yet available. The deaths are even more severe. Following this is a plague that spreads extremely quickly. Recently, there has also been a pestilence and wind disaster that has either completely eaten or blown away the beans planted at the end of spring. The remaining disaster victims will all be completely hopeless. It is hoped that our fellow countrymen, benevolent people, and charitable organizations will have compassion for this tragedy and quickly provide relief. Only by increasing the quantity and frequency of relief can it be effective." According to this, the disaster in Minyuan is truly the worst in Shaanxi. The old saying goes, "Three years of no harvest after six years." Now, it is "five years of no harvest after ten years." The old saying goes, "Nine out of ten rooms are empty." Now, it is "nine out of ten rooms are empty." Keeping the covenant, I am deeply saddened by my homeland, and I cannot help but shed tears. I sincerely and tearfully appeal to our charitable organizations, benevolent people, and fellow countrymen to care for this living hell and quickly provide relief to the starving people, greatly increasing assistance and continuing to save them, so that the living and the dead will be grateful for the great virtue, and it will be in human history forever. With tears and weeping, I present these words, hoping that you will have compassion and provide help. I cannot express the urgency of the telegram. I look forward to your pity and help. Zhang Shouyue, representative of the Minyuan Relief Branch in the province, bows in gratitude.</p>

<h3>Overseas Ports Tightening Restrictions on Chinese Immigrants</h3>
<p>Passport to Singapore Requires Endorsement by British Official</p>
<p>Even Harsher Regulations Enacted in the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, the cost of living in the country has been increasing daily, and people's livelihoods are difficult. The cunning take risks, while the honest find themselves at a dead end, forcing them to risk their lives to go abroad to work in order to find a morsel of food. Their situation is extremely miserable. Chinese laborers who are adrift and cannot find a foothold in the country are also subjected to various forms of harsh treatment by the local governments in Southeast Asia. Recently, Singapore has taken measures to limit the entry of Chinese immigrants due to the increasing number of arrivals. All passes previously issued by British consulates in various ports are no longer recognized as formal passports. Chinese passengers traveling in cabins will not be allowed to enter the country if their passports are not endorsed by British officials. The municipal government here has already issued a notice to inform merchants and residents, which roughly states: "The Consulate-General of China in Singapore has issued Official Letter No. 159, stating that the local government has announced that, starting from June 1, 1930, all passes for Chinese passengers traveling in cabins issued by the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Affairs Department or British consuls stationed in Xiamen, Shantou, and other ports in China will not be accepted as formal passports. Hereafter, Chinese passengers traveling in cabins must submit passports that have been officially countersigned by British officials in order to be allowed entry." Subsequently, this Consulate-General sent a letter to inquire about which classes were included in the term "cabins," and received a reply stating that "cabins" include passengers of all classes, except for those in steerage. In addition to reporting this to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we are sending this communication to you for your information and announcement to the public." At the same time, this government has received a letter from the British Consulate in Guangzhou with the same content. Therefore, this announcement is hereby issued to inform all merchants and residents of this city." As for the Dutch East Indies in Southeast Asia, their newly promulgated entry regulations are even harsher. According to a certain overseas Chinese gentleman who recently returned to Guangzhou after traveling in the Dutch East Indies, it is now more difficult than before for overseas Chinese who intend to transfer to the Dutch East Indies to seek a livelihood because the local government's restrictions on Chinese immigrants are meticulous in every detail. Examples of such harshness are as follows: (1) New immigrants must prepare the following matters before entering the country: (A) An exit passport must be signed by the Dutch Consul. (B) One hundred guilders in gold coins commonly used in the Dutch East Indies. (C) A guarantor (employer) at the time of entry, in accordance with the Dutch East Indies entry regulations: (1) Upper-class merchants who carry capital and can be trusted; (2) those who do not contain political implications and have considerable documentary proof; (3) shop clerks; (4) workers; (5) teachers; (6) hawkers with very little capital, etc., must have a guarantor before they can enter the country. (2) Matters that old immigrants must pay attention to when returning to the Dutch East Indies: (A) Whether the Dutch East Indies residence permit has expired. If the permit has expired, the treatment is exactly the same as that of new immigrants when they go to the Dutch East Indies again. They must pay the entry tax again and still need a guarantor. (B) Whether the residence permit was reported to the Immigration Bureau or the competent official for signature when they last left the Dutch East Indies. Otherwise, the residence permit will be invalid when they come to the Dutch East Indies again, and they will still be processed as new immigrants. (C) Old immigrants must also apply for an exit passport and present a return passport obtained from the Chinese Consulate in the Dutch East Indies for inspection. (3) Matters to be avoided when new and old immigrants enter the country: (A) No matter what qualifications are used to come to the Dutch East Indies, it is absolutely forbidden to carry books, diaries, newspapers, letters, etc. that are slightly related to politics, as well as any contraband. (B) No matter how long they have resided in the Dutch East Indies, it is absolutely forbidden to engage in political activities, especially not to have radical remarks. (C) Intellectuals must not pretend to be workers or coolies. Once the Dutch East Indies Immigration Bureau finds out that they have improper plans, they will be immediately expelled or sent back to the country. (June 9th)</p>
<h3>Shandong's Finances After the Military Unrest</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong's finances were in extreme disarray before the provincial government moved to Jinan in June of the 18th year of the Republic. After Yuan Jiapu, the Director of Finance, took office, he carefully formulated a rectification plan and promoted it step by step, which put the finances on the right track. Unfortunately, Heaven did not tire of chaos, and military unrest broke out again. Based on the current situation, there is a danger that Shandong's finances will fall back into a state of chaos. Fortunately, the Department of Finance has remained calm and continued to handle official business as usual. All expenditures are based on the budget as the standard. Any temporary expenditures, regardless of any orders or how urgent the needs, cannot be accommodated unless they have been approved by the provincial government's standing committee. In addition, items not included in the budget are especially not paid. This method has been implemented for more than a year and has never been changed. However, since the outbreak of military unrest, the counties in northern Shandong have been occupied by the Jin Army one after another, and all taxes and levies that should have been remitted have been intercepted by them. Even the remittances of funds from other counties and bureaus are often delayed under various pretexts, or directly withdrawn by the stationed troops, with only a piece of official document submitted to request offsetting the appropriation. Expenditures are increasing day by day, while the sources of income are decreasing, and all military and political expenses that should be paid cannot be suspended in the slightest. Under such circumstances, this is truly a major financial difficulty. In April, Shandong's finances had a deficit, but fortunately, it was able to make it through by using the surplus from March to offset it. Last month (May), income decreased day by day, and military expenses increased additionally, resulting in a deficit of more than 170,000 yuan. The total cash income in the treasury was 1,810,893.54 yuan, and the total cash expenditure was 1,987,450.11 yuan. Together with the surplus from the previous month, the remaining balance was 14,000 yuan. The detailed income and expenditure report of the Department of Finance for May is recorded below.</p>
<p>Income: Under the old management, the surplus from the previous month was 190,599.06 yuan. Under new receipts, field tax was 861,980.75 yuan, boat tax was 743.70 yuan, miscellaneous income was 39,807.25 yuan, goods tax was 68,596.17 yuan, pawn tax was 1,746.13 yuan, fines were 2,429.32 yuan, consolidated tax was 555,819.83 yuan, savings were 824.39 yuan, livestock slaughter tax was 36,440.35 yuan, deed tax was 85,849.50 yuan, oil press tax was 3,936.78 yuan, license tax was 24,593.96 yuan, broker's fee was 11,162.76 yuan, cattle certificate fee was 100,352 yuan, and arrears of payments were 16,610.69 yuan.

<h3>The Labor Strike of Pilots on the Upper Yangtze River</h3>
<p>The strike has lasted for nearly half a year, resulting in huge losses for foreign ships.</p>
<p>Chinese ships' business is booming, and the United States and France recognize salary increases.</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: The labor strike of pilots on the upper Yangtze River (from Chongqing to Yichang) has lasted for nearly half a year without any possibility of resolution. The various events that have occurred during this period are quite noteworthy. The following is a description of the facts before and after the strike of pilots on the upper Yangtze River.</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<h3>Summary of Important News</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of customs offices in Chongqing and Yichang, all pilots on ships traveling up and down the river must be qualified by the customs examination before they can serve. For this reason, the river patrol officers set up by the Yichang and Chongqing customs offices, in addition to their inherent duties, also serve as examiners of pilot talent. In general, all merchant ships, whether Chinese or foreign, sailing between Yichang and Chongqing must hire pilots who have been qualified by the examinations of the two customs offices and who hold licenses before they can operate. This intention is actually because the Sichuan River has many dangerous shoals. Those who are not familiar with the water conditions of each shoal and the navigation lines of low water and flood are prone to unexpected disasters. The method is very good. However, the personnel who are primarily responsible for the examination in the two customs offices are foreigners except for the patrol officers. The so-called old pilots are Chinese. As a result, Chinese people who wish to work as pilots in order to make a living often collude with the old pilots so that they can be slightly accommodated when advising the river patrol officers who do not understand the language, and those who seek to make a living can obtain licenses and serve.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, the River Patrol Officer of the Chongqing Customs was an Englishman named Plant. He had a lot of research on the navigation conditions of the Sichuan River. He had personally traveled to each dangerous shoal on the upper Yangtze River and had written a long thesis detailing the situation on the upper Yangtze River and advocating that the British must practice operating as pilots. He believed that although Chinese pilots were usable at the time, if there was a strike in the future, British merchant ships would undoubtedly suffer losses. This argument was quite noticed by the British merchants in China. As a result, the shipowners of each ship sailing upstream all practiced piloting, but the gentry's air was too heavy, and they still hired Chinese pilots. The rewards for these pilots were also set by Plant that year. The amount was 300 yuan per month for a senior pilot, 200 yuan per month for a second pilot, and 100 yuan per month for a third pilot. The so-called senior pilot is a formal pilot who has been qualified by the river patrol officer's examination and hired by a certain ship to serve. The second and third pilots are also known as apprentice pilots. Although they have not passed the examination, the ship can also hire them through the introduction of the senior pilot, but the reward is less than that of the senior pilot.</p>
<p>Since Plant, there have been hundreds of pilots on the upper Yangtze River who have been qualified by the River Patrol Officers of the Yichang and Chongqing customs offices. There are only dozens of Chinese and foreign merchant ships sailing between Yichang and Chongqing, and each ship only uses one qualified pilot. The remaining pilots cannot be hired unless the number of merchant ships on the upper Yangtze River increases. In addition, since the "May Thirtieth" and "September Fifth" incidents, the wave of boycotting the British and Japanese has suddenly surged. As a result, the number of foreign ships on the upper Yangtze River has decreased, and the number of unemployed pilots has increased day by day. The rewards received by the small number of pilots who are currently serving are all those set ten years ago. Now that wages are high and rice is expensive, there is no surplus capital to help the industry, and they have no choice but to ask the employers for a salary increase to maintain themselves.</p>
<p>At the end of January of this year, the Yangtze River Upper Pilots Union in Yichang submitted a request for a salary increase to the various shipping companies based on the above reasons. The proposed salary increase method at that time was that, starting from February, each ship should increase the salary of the pilot by 50 yuan per month, and then increase it by 50 yuan per month starting from next year, and then increase it by 100 yuan per month in the third year. The senior pilot will increase to 500 yuan, the second pilot will increase to 400 yuan, and the third pilot will increase to 300 yuan. In addition, the various shipping companies will subsidize the senior pilot's food expenses by 50 yuan per month, and the second and third pilots by 30 yuan each. After receiving the news, the various shipping companies immediately considered in many ways that the pilot's salary was set by Plant, and the pilot contract had not yet expired. They could not break the rules and overturn the contract. Rather than agreeing to a salary increase, it would be better to dismiss the pilots in office and hire others. As a result, the two sides insisted on their own positions and refused to give way, and the strike of pilots on the upper Yangtze River has been out of control to this day. When the Yichang and Chongqing pilots first planned to strike, there were very few Chinese ships on the upper Yangtze River, and they wanted to strive for autonomy in navigation rights, so they immediately agreed to their request. The merchant ships of the United States and France on the upper Yangtze River saw that the Chinese ships were operating as usual, and if they did not urgently seek relief, they would suffer huge losses. They broke away from the British and Japanese groups and directly negotiated with the pilots' union. If the pilots of the merchant ships of the United States and France could cancel the strike, they would allow the salary increase in accordance with the contract recognized by the British and Japanese countries in the future and subsidize the food expenses by 120 yuan. The merchant ships of the United Kingdom and Japan saw that the merchant ships of the United States and France were operating as usual, so they allowed each ship to increase the salary of the senior, second, and third pilots by 25 yuan per month, but did not discuss the subsidization of food expenses. The Yichang and Chongqing Pilots Union firmly refused to recognize this, so no merchant ships from the United Kingdom and Japan have sailed upstream to this day. (June 1st)</p>
<h3>Suspected Case of Japanese Police Arresting Bandits in Shenyang</h3>
<p>Panyang Correspondence: At 6:00 p.m. on the 7th, three bandits were walking on the Japanese station. Several patrol officers from the Japanese Police Department saw that the three bandits were acting suspiciously and ordered them to stop for inspection. Seeing that the situation was not good, the three bandits took the initiative to shoot the patrol officers with handguns. One Chinese patrol officer fell to the ground and died. At that time, there were many tourists in the road. Suddenly, upon hearing the gunshots, they fled in panic. The three bandits were about to flee when more and more Japanese police and Chinese constables gathered from all directions and surrounded the three bandits. The bandits then squatted on the ground and fired. The Japanese police and others also fired back with fierce attacks. For a time, the sound of gunfire was as dense as firecrackers for about half an hour. Two bandits were shot on the spot, both of whom were hit by bullets in four or five places. The remaining bandit surrendered. The Japanese police arrested them and took them to the Japanese police station for interrogation. One of the two seriously injured bandits was named Shen Dehong, and the other was named Wang Zhenzhong. The other bandit was named Cui Zhongke. Later, the Japanese police saw that the two bandits, Shen and Wang, were seriously injured, and Wang was unable to speak. They immediately extradited them to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau in our commercial port. Wang soon died of his injuries. After the Public Security Bureau reported to the local court's procuratorate, the prosecutors Chen Tengxiang and Mu Meilou were dispatched to conduct an inspection. They found that the gunshot wounds on the two bandits were indeed caused by being shot and that they died of their injuries without any doubt. The bandit Shen was also seriously injured and dying, but he was still able to speak with difficulty. According to his confession, he and Wang Zhenzhong were companions. Wang was from Shuipaozi, 25 miles south of the city. A certain brother of his was working in the Yingkou Tax Bureau and was recently transferred to Shenyang. Shen was from Miaogou and lived only two miles away from Wang. A few days ago, Wang brought Shen to Shenyang to find his brother and seek a job, but he was unsuccessful. On that day, they planned to take the South Manchuria train back to their hometown. They met a stranger (namely Cui Zhongke) in front of the ticket office of the Japanese station. The stranger said that the price of gold tickets had risen and foreign goods were also expensive. Unexpectedly, a Chinese patrol officer saw that we were acting suspiciously and came forward to question us. Cui suddenly pulled out a handgun and resisted arrest. At the same time, a large number of Japanese police rushed to the scene and opened fire. Unfortunately, Wang died and I was also seriously injured. We did not have any handguns on us, etc. What is the truth of this case? In order to value human life, our side has sent personnel to investigate. It will not be difficult to find out the truth in the future. However, when the Japanese police extradited the bandits, they did attach three eight-shot and ten-shot box guns, and Cui, who was captured alive, also claimed that he did not know Shen and Wang, so this case is still doubtful.

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Disturbance of Wounded Soldiers Demanding Rewards: At 4:30 p.m. on the 15th, more than 300 wounded soldiers went to the county government to demand the issuance of reward money of 10 yuan per person. Because the county government's procedures were slower, the wounded soldiers suddenly had a dispute with the county police team and seized more than a dozen guns. Fortunately, the garrison immediately dispatched a team to rush to the scene to suppress the situation and confiscate the guns. At 5:30 p.m., they were persuaded to return to the hospital. During the conflict, a platoon leader of the garrison was shot in the leg. A guard from the Third Branch of the prison near the county government had a handgun seized. At that time, the prisoners even tried to break out of the prison, but fortunately, the iron door was locked tightly and they were unable to rush out. All the shops in the Yangyutang area were closed, and the market was in a state of panic. At about 6:00 p.m., there was also a small disturbance at the Lichang Hotel outside the Changmen Gate, and several wounded soldiers were arrested.</p>
<p>Continued News: The wounded soldiers in the city caused trouble. They first surrounded the county government. The wounded soldiers outside the city swarmed into the city after hearing the alarm. At that time, a tour group from the Fukuoka Commercial School in Japan, consisting of 78 people, had just arrived in Suzhou from Shanghai in the morning. However, the authorities were not notified in advance. The group lined up and left the city. At the entrance of the Lichang Hotel outside the Changmen Gate, they boarded horses to the train station outside the city. The wounded soldiers outside the city also wanted to ride horses into the city, but the number of horses was limited and the supply could not meet the demand. Due to language barriers, the wounded soldiers and the tour group had a fight. Two Japanese were slightly injured, one named Yoshimura Yoshikan, 18 years old, and the other named Matsu Dai Senji, also named Iohara, 19 years old. The two injured Japanese stayed in Suzhou for treatment that night, and the rest took the night train back to Shanghai. During the disturbance, 240 prisoners in the Third Prison Branch were having dinner when the iron door was not locked, and the whole group took the opportunity to rush out. More than 100 people had already taken to the streets. Fortunately, the army's defense was strong, and they were rounded up everywhere. As a result, only one person escaped, named Zhou Heshang, a prisoner from Wu County sentenced to five years and two months. There were originally 700 or 800 wounded soldiers in the 17th Hospital in the city, and they are now scattered outside. During the disturbance, Li Hao, a platoon leader of the Third Platoon of the First Battalion of the Guard Brigade, 23 years old, from Anhui, was hit in the buttocks by a stray bullet. The bullet penetrated from the lower abdomen, and his injuries were serious. He is now seeking treatment at the Boxi Hospital. At about 6:00 p.m. in the evening, the merchants in the city and outside the city were panicked, and all of them were like birds startled by the bow, and they announced the closure of the market.</p>

<p>A Rabid Dog Bites a Child to Death: Jinlin, the 12-year-old son of Yao Songquan, a villager in Zhangjia Village, Fangtai Township, in the county, was bitten in the foot by a rabid dog while shopping in the market in March. His father, Yao, was reluctant to pay for medical expenses and only disinfected it with a small amount of medicine. He did not pay attention to it afterwards. On the 13th of this month, he suffered an attack and moaned. He then climbed the bed and tore the mat, asking to have his abdomen cut open to release the dog. He even bit off two fingers on his eating hand, and blood flowed profusely. He shouted for two days and nights and died. It is extremely tragic.</p>

<p>Drowning of Young Men and Women: Continued News: Nameless corpses of men and women were found in Xugongqiao Town in the county. This newspaper has already reported this on the 13th of this month. After receiving the report, the county government immediately sent Trial Official Chen Cheng to the countryside with a secretary to conduct an autopsy. There were no injuries on the two corpses, and they were indeed drowned by accident. There was a small leather box, 18 copper coins, and a membership card with the words "April 16th meeting, four times a year, Li Baosheng Jun" next to the male corpse. There are currently no relatives of the deceased to claim the bodies. The local government purchased coffins and buried them and marked them for collection. However, according to a woman surnamed Liu who came to the countryside in the same car as the men and women, the two spoke with a Songjiang accent.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Record of the Memorial Service for the Fallen Soldiers of the Sijing Security Corps: On April 28th, Sijing Town in Songyi was robbed for the second time. The Security Corps tried their best to resist, and the entire town was spared from the destruction. During the fierce battle, squad leader Li Jinsheng and soldiers Li Weibin and Zhou Qiurong were killed by bandits because their ammunition was exhausted. The business, academic, and other sectors of the entire town believed that Li and others were loyal and brave. In addition to giving them generous funerals and providing pensions to their families, they held a memorial service yesterday (15th) in the auditorium of the District Office.

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Li Xiyuan Plots the Murder of His Wife in the Middle of the Night: Li Xiyuan, a villager from Daqiao Township, Qingcheng City, under the jurisdiction of Wuxi County, married a woman named Mao Xiubao. After their marriage, they had a daughter and lived peacefully. On the 10th of this month, Xiubao went to the field to cut wheat and returned home. Li wanted to give the cut wheat to his mother for safekeeping, but Mao refused, which angered Xiyuan. He severely beat Mao. Li's mother also stepped forward and grabbed her daughter-in-law, helping her son to beat her severely, causing her to be covered in injuries and blood. Around midnight that night, Li Xiyuan, still unwilling, conspired with his mother to bring a bag of lime and a sharp knife into the room, intending to murder Mao. Mao was terrified at the sight and shouted for help. Li Xiyuan immediately threw a bag of lime into Mao's eyes. Neighbors heard the commotion and rushed over, managing to cure Mao's eyes. Unexpectedly, by daybreak, Mao was locked in a room with iron chains by her husband, and deprived of food for two days. Mao's uncle, Qin Meifu, and others found out and immediately went to the city to file a report with the Public Security Bureau, requesting an investigation. Director Huang, after receiving the report, immediately dispatched a detective team to the village to arrest the suspect Li Xiyuan and others. However, upon arrival at the village, Li Xiyuan had already fled after hearing the news, and the local headman, Xi Ziyu, was also nowhere to be found. They then took Mao to the city and sent her to the Bureau. Yesterday afternoon, Section Chief Qian held a court hearing, instructing Mao to go to the county to have her injuries examined, and ordered the strict arrest of the two suspects, Li Xiyuan and his mother, as well as the local headman, Xi Ziyu, before further legal action could be taken.</p>
<p>Actively Preparing to Organize a Rear Hospital: Cai Xiafu, the director of the 22nd Rear Hospital stationed in Wuxi, along with the quartermaster and adjutant, came to Wuxi from Beijing to organize the rear hospital. Yesterday, they specifically met with Qian Tianxiong and Gu Yonggeng, the director and deputy director of the General Affairs Section of the Wounded Soldiers Reception Center, to inspect the wounded soldiers' accommodations at Huishan. The wounded soldiers must have beds to facilitate treatment. Currently, the only confirmed locations are the Dongyue Temple, Zhang Zhongcheng Temple, Gu Dongyang Ancestral Hall, and Wang Clan Ancestral Hall, which are only sufficient to accommodate 350 wounded soldiers. It is necessary to use all the ancestral halls in Huishan as rear hospitals. After inspecting the various ancestral halls, they will return to the city to discuss borrowing them with the county government. The county government also received a telegram from the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs the night before, instructing them to quickly prepare various reception and supply items. The first batch of these wounded soldiers, totaling more than 500, has been approved to depart from Beijing for Wuxi yesterday.</p>
<p>Suspect Arrested in the Extortion Case of Miao Bin: Since the attack on Song Shaolun, the gate guard of the residence of the former Director of Civil Affairs, Jiu Bin, in front of the Bianmin Bridge inside the South Gate last month, the security around the residence has been extremely tight. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, the Miao residence suddenly received an anonymous letter, initially demanding 50,000 yuan with many threatening words, and also demanding a response in the Da Gong Bao newspaper. After receiving the letter, the Miao residence not only reported it to the Public Security Bureau for strict security, but also replied to the robber's letter at the designated location, feigning compliance. The robbers replied again, reducing the amount to 20,000 yuan, and agreed to throw the money into a tin box for scrap paper in the Badao Alley outside the North Gate at 5:00 AM on the 15th. At that time, the Public Security Bureau had already made careful arrangements, assigning officers to wait around. After 5:00 AM yesterday morning, a young man was seen looking around beside the tin box. He immediately walked to the box and touched a large package, revealing a happy expression. He walked straight into the Huang Zijing Dental Clinic across the street. The detectives rushed forward and arrested him. After questioning, it was learned that he was a student at the clinic. He was immediately escorted to the County Public Security Bureau along with Huang Zijing for interrogation.</p>
<p>Leather Worker Induces and Rapes Three Young Girls: Luo Xiaoda, a member of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau outside the South Gate, led a patrol at around 3:00 AM the night before. When they arrived at the Qingming Bridge Elementary School, they saw that the school gate was ajar. They went inside to investigate and saw a man and three young girls using the desks as beds for sleeping and fornication. They were immediately arrested. Branch Chief Zhu Niansheng interrogated them. The man, named Hua Meichang, 19 years old, a tanner, admitted to inducing the young girls Zhou Jinzhu and others with the intention of raping them. The girls, Zhou Jinzhu, Ding Zhangdi, and Lu Yuan, stated that they were about 13 or 14 years old and worked as basin workers in a silk factory. They said they were dragged to the school to sleep by a stranger on their way home from listening to stories last night. Branch Chief Zhu, considering that the case involved the inducement and rape of young girls, prepared a document and sent it to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Robbery Occurs in the Suburbs: At Sheng Ronggen's house in Shengjiawan, about a mile outside the Wuyi Dabeimen, four robbers suddenly arrived at around 10:00 PM on the 14th. One of them held a handgun and said he wanted to borrow 50 yuan. They then entered Ronggen's room, fired a shot to intimidate him, and searched at will, stealing 18 yuan from the large cabinet and cotton-padded clothes from the box. Before leaving, they met Ronggen's wife, who tried to take off a pair of her gold hairpins. They escaped to the west.</p>
<p>Police Team Captures Bandits: The Wuyi County Government dispatched detectives on the 13th to arrest a bandit named Zhang Hongsheng. He was taken to the county for interrogation and confessed that there were three other accomplices hiding in the Hualong Lane Zhonghe Hotel. County Magistrate Wu immediately ordered the captain of the Second Police Squad to lead police to arrest Su Yaosheng, Ding Zhenyuan, and Ding Desheng at around 1:00 AM on the 14th. They were taken to confront Zhang Hongsheng. According to Ding Desheng's confession, there was another bandit leader named Zhang, who had a handgun and was hiding in the pig market head of the Kang family outside the North Gate. It was already after 2:00 AM at that time. Captain Chen Tianxi led the police to the Yin residence to knock on the door for arrest. Sun Peisheng and Liu Tuqing in the house came out from the side door and mistakenly reported to Yao Junchen, the captain of the merchant team, that they were being robbed. Yao then fired a shot as a warning, causing a bullet to pierce a hole in the pants of a police officer's leg. The bandit Zhang was not captured.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Eastern Township Kills Bandit Leader: The Eastern Township of Tongyi, which claimed to be a Red Army bandit, has achieved repeated victories after being suppressed by the Fourth Brigade of the Provincial Police Force. It is now reported that Tang Chu 　 (i.e., Tang Rujing), the false commander-in-chief and political commissar of the Jiangbei Red Army, was indeed shot and killed in a cargo team. Qiu Jianzhong, the false brigade commander, was also killed by stray bullets. Both have been confirmed. The bandit forces in the Eastern Township are gradually calming down.</p>
<p>Special Police Squad Leader Replaced: Zhang Shushen, the captain of the special police squad of the Public Security Bureau, has been transferred to the Shijiao Branch. The squad leader will be replaced by someone from Kunshan.</p>

On the 14th, Captain Zhang 　 Huan handed over the witnesses to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<p>Four County Representatives Hold Defense Conference: Military, political, and police officials, as well as local representatives from the four counties of Nantong, Rugao, Haimen, and Qidong, held two discussions on defense in Hai and Ru counties. The following key cases were resolved: (1) Bandit suppression fees: Nantong bears 50%, Haimen 30%, and Qidong 20%. (2) Ships such as silk and fish transport boats in the bandit suppression area shall be patrolled and temporarily blockaded by naval vessels. (3) Yancheng shall be excluded from the scope of the nine counties so that the 20 provincial defense regiments within the area will not be scattered and can be effectively coordinated.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Shazhou Organizes Joint Defense Association: For the protection of the villagers in the Eastern Township and various townships in Shazhou, the heads of the business corps and security corps of six townships, including Zhongzheng, Deshun, Fushan, Nianfeng, and Changyinsha, who are located in a remote corner adjacent to the Yangtze River and vulnerable to banditry from across the river, held a meeting the other day and decided to organize a joint defense association of the six townships. Yang Xueying, the director of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau, was publicly recommended as the director of the joint defense affairs, and Chen Songshan, the head of the Deshun Hucao Port Security Corps, was recommended as the deputy director. The matter was submitted to the county for approval and record.</p>
<p>Biological Mother Beats Young Daughter to Death: Yang Qiamin, from Huidui Alley in the city area, is currently working in the Hankou General Headquarters. His wife is foolish. Last year, suspecting her husband of having an affair, she spent 500 yuan to invite a Taoist priest to exorcise evil spirits. She had a daughter named Shimin, who was nine years old and studying at the Cangwan Elementary School. She was often beaten by her mother. The night before last (the 13th), she beat Shimin again and sat on her body until she suffocated to death.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Magistrate of Jingjiang County to Go to the Province: Wang Jiwu, the magistrate of Jingjiang County, and Sheng Xiru, a member of the Party-County Committee, went to the province on the 14th, passing through Cheng, because the bandit atmosphere in the county was very strong. Within 200 miles of the border between the three counties of Jing, Ru, and Tai, all areas are bandit areas, and Party and government agencies are difficult to manage. The purpose of going to the province is to handle the establishment of the Security Corps Headquarters in the county government. The expenses are managed by the county Party department. Those with 500 mu of land must donate 20 cents per month. However, whether or not to approve it must be presented to Director Hu in person for handling.</p>
<p>Hall Orders Suspension of Household Survey: The household survey in one district was originally scheduled to be held on the 22nd. Various forms had been submitted to the printing office for printing, and most of them had been completed. The county government had not yet received the detailed rules and various forms for the survey from the People's Hall, which should be approved and promulgated. The survey should be suspended temporarily. After receiving the order, Magistrate Li convened an emergency meeting of representatives from various agencies yesterday (the 14th) and quickly ordered all districts to suspend the survey, and also ordered the Zhicheng Printing Office to stop printing various forms. The committee also temporarily suspended its work.</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>Bandits Attack Shizhuang: At about 5:00 PM on the 11th, Shizhuang Town, Rugao, was suddenly attacked by thousands of bandits armed with weapons, who surrounded it from three sides.

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Strict Investigation of Malpractice by Clerks in Various Counties: The Jiangsu Department of Finance recently received a report from Wen Qinming, the magistrate of Suining County, regarding the malpractice of the former clerks, stating that the clerks collected grain during disasters and famines, and officials colluded with the clerks from top to bottom. Officials accepted bribes and could not strictly punish the clerks, which made the clerks even more cunning and disobedient to the law. Officials had no way to manage them, leading to increasingly sluggish tax collection, increasingly depleted finances, and the failure of all policies. After receiving the report, the Department of Finance deeply believed that such malpractice existed in all counties. Collecting extra fees was commonplace. Therefore, it specifically issued an order to all counties yesterday to conduct strict investigations to rectify the financial administration.</p>
<p>Academic Lecture at Jiangsu Provincial Hospital: The Jiangsu Provincial Hospital organized an academic lecture group last year, holding lectures once a week in rotation. The intention was good, but unfortunately, after holding several meetings, it was suspended due to the hospital's neglect of duties. Now, Dr. Wang Yuanchen has taken over as the new president of the hospital and is sparing no effort in rectifying everything. The academic lecture group has also been revived at the same time. At 8:00 PM last night, a meeting was held in the hospital's reception hall. All the doctors attended the meeting. The rotating attendees were Dr. Zhu Deming, the director of internal medicine, and Dr. Wang Xunhe. Various candies, tea, and snacks were prepared to enhance the atmosphere. The speakers were President Wang and his wife, Dr. Wang Huangying, the director of obstetrics and gynecology. President Wang spoke on "The Causes and Treatment of Vomiting After Surgery." Dr. Wang Huangying spoke on "The Diagnosis and Treatment of Blood Stasis During Pregnancy." Both talks were extremely valuable and practical. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 PM and stipulated that the rotating lectures should not be avoided. This is truly a so-called career institution that is academicized.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>

<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Water Police Suppress Bandits and Rescue Hostages: The Second District Department of the Jiaxing Water Police received an order from the General Headquarters for the Suppression of Bandits in the Three Provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to go to Xinmiao and other places on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to jointly suppress the bandits. District Chief Xu immediately ordered Wang Deqing, the captain of the Second District Patrol Team, to lead the first, second, and third squads, as well as the Zhiguo warship, to depart on the 12th, go to Pinghu, and then to Xintang via Xinmiao Zhujing. On the 14th, they transferred from Xintang to Dingjiazha Yuhui. They dispatched Detective Chief Xu Gang and Detective Wu Shousheng to investigate in the four places. They discovered that a group of bandits, Taibao Ashu, had extorted 800 yuan from Yuhui a few days ago and were now heading south. The team immediately searched and advanced in three directions near the new town of Qingpu County, at the intersection of the three provinces of Jiang, Zhe, and Jiang. The Zhiguo warship moved forward to Dagang on the left wing. Captain Wang Xia and other officers led their troops to search Fanbang in the new town. At that time, more than 60 bandits and six bandit ships were discovered, and a battle immediately took place. At the same time, the Zhiguo warship opened fire to assist in the battle. After about two hours, the bandit leader Wang Afa was killed on the spot, along with three other bandits. They also rescued the abducted hostages Shen Jinshou, Zhou Ada, Gu Shaorong, and Jin Deguan, as well as the female hostage Yang Yushi. They also captured four bandit ships, including a sailing ship bound for the Lutang-Xitang boat household Zhou Chaxian, his son, and three other boatmen, Lu Xinxiang, and a civilian boat belonging to the boat household Chen Nanhua, his son, and two other boatmen, totaling six people. After further strict searches, no trace of the bandits was found due to the complexity of the Hong Kong waterways. The team has now brought back to Jiaxing the killed bandit leader Wang Afa (the remaining three dead robbers had been taken back by the bandits), a group of people, and four ships. Wang Afa was photographed and the coroner was invited to examine and coffin him. The process of bandit suppression and the rescued hostages, ships and all relevant records have been reported to the county for approval.</p>
<p>Oil Chegang Group Police Conflict Case Scheduled for Interrogation: A conflict occurred between the Youchegang Security Corps in Jiaxing and the police chief of the local police substation, resulting in a security corps member being injured with a knife. Both sides have filed lawsuits in court against each other for injuries.

<p>Subsidized Grain Sales Scheduled to Begin: Because the price of food in Jiaxing is high and the poor find it difficult to afford grain, the county government initiated subsidized grain sales. Preparations have been underway for a long time, and various village associations have also investigated and registered the poor households. It is learned that the county government convened a meeting of various legal entities the other day, and it was decided that subsidized grain sales would begin throughout the county on July 1st. Subsidized grain certificates are currently being issued so that the poor households can present them to purchase grain at that time.</p>

<h3>Important News</h3>
<p>The Purpose of Promoting Phonetic Symbols (Chiang Meng-lin)</p>
<p>The promotion of phonetic symbols has already been resolved by the Second National Education Conference, and the Central Committee's 88th Standing Committee also has a resolution. The Central Committee has also set three methods for promotion:</p>
<p>(1) Issue orders to Party branches at all levels to have Party members adopt them uniformly to increase convenience in publicizing Party principles.</p>
<p>(2) Inform the National Government to order personnel in all government agencies to memorize them thoroughly to assist in understanding the hardships of out-of-school people.</p>
<p>(3) Instruct the Ministry of Education to order teachers and students in educational institutions at all levels to learn and teach them, and to cooperate to facilitate the implementation of supplementary education for the public.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has now announced the organizational regulations for a Phonetic Symbol Promotion Committee, which will first be organized by the ministry. Furthermore, a notice will be sent to local educational administrative agencies to also organize Phonetic Symbol Promotion Committees to serve as specialized cadres for promoting phonetic symbols. After receiving the order from the National Government, the Ministry of Education began editing a small booklet for teaching and learning phonetic symbols, compiling the learning process and methods into a textbook for people to use as learning materials. Once this learning booklet is compiled, it is planned to invite experts who are knowledgeable in phonetics and have accurate pronunciation to record phonetic symbol phonograph records so that everyone can pronounce the symbols simply by listening to the records, which will greatly facilitate learning.</p>
<p>Why do we want to actively promote phonetic symbols?</p>
<p>We roughly estimate (because there are no precise statistics to check, we can only say a rough estimate) that China has a population of over 436,094,000, of which only over 87,218,000 people are literate, accounting for about 20% of the total population. The remaining 80% have not received education and are illiterate. Education is the foundation of the nation, and literacy is an important matter in life. How serious is it that there are so many illiterate citizens in a country? Our Party, upholding the legacy of the Premier and leading the government in implementing tutelage, strives for the realization of a truly democratic country. The most urgent step at present is to train the people to exercise the four powers and cultivate their political abilities to establish the foundation of constitutional government. How can the four powers be exercised and civil rights be popularized if there are so many illiterate people who have not received adequate education? Moreover, in today's era of survival competition, both individual and national survival require individuals and national constituents to have sufficient living abilities first. We often say how rich and strong European and American countries are. We must understand that the reason for their wealth and strength is that many of their citizens are educated. According to statistics from a few years ago, literate people in Germany account for 99% of the total population, France has 96.5%, Japan has 95%, the United States has 92.3%, the United Kingdom has 86.5%, and even Italy has 61.3%. China only has 20%| or perhaps even less than 20%|. If we do not strive for self-improvement and increase the number of literate people in the country to a ratio similar to that of European and American countries, to put it pessimistically, China will eventually be eliminated by cultural evolution. Because this is a fundamental issue, we do not want to say alarming words. For this reason, we must work hard on the literacy movement.</p>
<p>Since we must work hard on the literacy movement, we know that the most uneconomical aspect of Chinese education is the issue of literacy. What educators struggle with the most is also the issue of literacy. There are more than 40,000 Chinese characters in total, and about 4,000 to 5,000 are commonly used. According to the "Popular Thousand Character Primer" compiled by the Chinese Education Improvement Society a few years ago, it takes a year to learn. The "Three Principles of the People Thousand Character Primer" compiled by the Ministry for public supplementary education also takes four months to learn. Learning the commonly used 4,000 to 5,000 characters would take at least two or three years. Not to mention the uneconomical use of time, it is also too uneconomical in terms of the economic ability of ordinary people in Chinese society today. Therefore, if we want to make compulsory education universal, supplementary education effective, elementary education improved, and secondary education enhanced, we must use a method that "requires less effort and achieves greater success" to thoroughly solve this difficult problem of literacy. Our predecessors also felt this problem and established methods for phonetic literacy, called "du ruo," "zhi yin," and "fan qie," annotating the sound of each character to help people become literate. This also had considerable power, but without scientific methods or classification, it became complicated and cumbersome, making it difficult to understand. If we use phonetic symbols to annotate the sound, as long as we remember the forty letters and learn the method of combining sounds, then when a character has symbols next to it, we can read the sound at a glance, understand the meaning from the sound, and recognize the character from the meaning. Wouldn't that be convenient? If we annotate a character with the local dialect on the left and the national pronunciation on the right, recognize the character from the local dialect, and recognize the national pronunciation from the character, wouldn't pronunciation unification also be included? In this era of advanced academics and complex affairs, all methods of governance should become simpler day by day. With this extremely sharp literacy tool, the most difficult literacy problem in Chinese education for decades can be considered thoroughly resolved. Since we recognize that the literacy movement is the most important work at present, we should strive to promote phonetic symbols. This is the meaning and purpose of promoting phonetic symbols.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we must especially point out that the main purpose of promoting phonetic symbols is not to unify the national language but to popularize literacy. Therefore, in addition to formulating national phonetic symbols, the Ministry of Education must also formulate local dialect initial consonant symbols for each local dialect.</p>
<p>We know that phonetic symbols are what were previously called phonetic alphabets. The movement to promote phonetic alphabets did not start today but several years ago. When phonetic alphabets were first promoted, wasn't it a great sensation? However, later it became (forcing it to continue) barely breathing, and almost no one cared about it. What is the reason for this? The biggest reason is that the cart was put before the horse, mistaking the most effective tool for literacy as the most effective tool for unifying the national language. Everyone's efforts were heavily focused on unifying the national language, thinking that a few dozen phonetic alphabets could make different dialects and local languages across the country speak in one voice, with the same sound and the same tone. As a result, everyone debated on the so-called standard sound and standard language, each establishing their own banner. Because people in various places had to imitate the standard sound and standard language, they twisted their tongues and teeth and passed it on repeatedly, resulting in a kind of "neither fish nor fowl" language. Everyone thought it was a failure, so the enthusiasm for learning the national language gradually cooled down, and the phonetic method stopped imperceptibly. Little did they know that it was a mistake to regard phonetic alphabets as an effective tool for unifying the national language. The most important condition for a national language is "convenient transportation." If we ignore the condition of convenient transportation and seek to unify the national language, it is like "climbing a tree to catch a fish," and it is difficult to succeed. Indeed, it is most detrimental to national sentiment and unity when there are so many different languages within the same nation. The current complex situation of language in China certainly needs to be unified, but the reason why local dialects and languages become local dialects and languages has historical and geographical reasons. It is by no means accidental. To eliminate local dialects and languages, we should break the natural barriers that cause them. To break these natural barriers, there is no more effective method than making transportation convenient. If transportation is convenient, people from the south can go to the north, and people from the west can go to the east. Over time, they will assimilate with each other, and language will naturally tend to be unified without unification. If at this time we do not strive to facilitate transportation but strive to unify the national language with phonetic alphabets, at best it can only be implemented in places where "Mandarin" is popular and among a class that is already literate, because they can already speak Mandarin. Teaching them to speak a national language consistent with the standard sound is just a step further to make it sound good. They already know the characters, and teaching them to read the national pronunciation consistent with the standard sound is just a step further to make it sound good. In fact, this has become "artistic," which is of no help to the majority of illiterate people. Mr. Wu Zhihui said something about promoting phonetic symbols:</p>
<p>"I always advocate "straw sandalism." Why? The function of shoes is first to protect the feet and second to run. Straw sandals can barely protect the feet and run. There are no shoes as good as the leather shoes made by your parents, which are worth twenty or thirty yuan. In fact, people who wear leather shoes worth twenty or thirty yuan have carpets at home and cars when they go out. The name is shoes, but they have become decorations. Decorations can be dispensed with, but straw sandals are still useful. I hope you will practice my "straw sandalism.""</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's words can serve as a "wake-up call" for those who previously used phonetic symbols exclusively to unify the national language. Because there are still 80% of the people in the country who are illiterate, not using phonetic symbols to teach them literacy but insisting that the majority of people who can speak Mandarin speak the standard sound of the national language, isn't this just talking about decoration without talking about practicality? It's like going to run but not wearing straw sandals and wearing leather shoes worth twenty or thirty yuan. Given the current state of China, where education is not universal, transportation is not convenient, and people have difficulty making a living, what ability do we have to wear leather shoes worth twenty or thirty yuan?</p>
<p>However, what I said above does not absolutely deny that promoting phonetic symbols cannot unify the national language. Regarding the function of phonetic symbols, it can also unify the national language, but this is a side effect obtained incidentally from phonetic literacy. This incidentally obtained side effect still relies on the material conditions of convenient transportation to achieve the effect of unifying the national language. Therefore, at this time, we should abandon the previous concept of "the purpose of promoting phonetic symbols is to unify the national language" and postpone the unification of the national language for fifty years. Now we only need to know the single concept that "the purpose of promoting phonetic symbols is literacy" and do everything according to this goal. Local dialects can be annotated, and local languages can be annotated. It is not necessary to designate the sound of a certain place as the standard sound or a certain language as the national language. In short, the purpose is to use phonetic methods to enable the 80% of illiterate people in the country to become literate in a short period of time. Therefore, Mr. Wu said:</p>
<p>"For example, people from Ningbo pronounce "we" as "ala." If you give phonetic notation, then annotate "ala" under "we." You will understand it at a glance. Therefore, the final slogan is "We are ala.""</p>
<p>Of course, teaching the people of Ningbo to recognize the two characters "we" is not as simple as Mr. Wu said. However, if we do not use this method but insist on using Mandarin and national pronunciation to teach the people of Ningbo, who have always only known "ala" and do not know "we" or the two characters "we," to recognize the two characters "we," then the people of Ningbo must first become mutes and then change their voices to read "we" and say "we." Children may be able to do it, but people over the age of fifteen will probably have a hard time. They will still say, "We say ala." How convenient is that? Why must we say "we?"" Then we can only wait for this convenience. Why must the two characters "we" be popular in Ningbo? This is so ridiculous! Therefore, this time when we promote phonetic symbols, we should shout out the following slogans:</p>
<p>(1) The purpose of promoting phonetic symbols is to enable illiterate people to become literate.</p>
<p>(2) Promoting phonetic symbols is not used to unify the national language.</p>
<p>(3) We first enable illiterate people to become literate and then seek the unification of the national language after popularizing literacy.</p>

<p>Ministry Order</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Primary Schools Should Not Use Classical Chinese Textbooks</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education ordered overseas consuls to encourage overseas Chinese schools not to use classical Chinese primary school textbooks. The order stated:</p>
<p>It is hereby notified that in order to ban classical Chinese primary school textbooks, the Ministry has issued a notice to the education administrative agencies of all provinces and cities to instruct all bookstores to seal up all paper patterns and printing plates of the said books. It is now reported by the Shanghai bookstores that "many places in Nanyang still use classical Chinese primary school textbooks. Please allow a delay in sealing up the said paper patterns and printing plates to alleviate the difficulties of merchants." The Ministry has investigated that vernacular primary school textbooks are unimpeded in important locations in Nanyang, such as Singapore, the Philippines, and Java. Those who still adhere to old habits and stubbornly use classical Chinese primary school textbooks should be persuaded to ensure that all overseas Chinese schools absolutely no longer use classical Chinese primary school textbooks to improve teaching efficiency and create greater achievements. In addition to instructing the bookstores that their request should not be considered and issuing separate orders, you are hereby ordered to widely publicize and persuade and prohibit overseas Chinese schools from using classical Chinese primary school textbooks in the future in order to implement the Ministry's plan to ban the said books. Do not delay. This order is hereby issued.</p>

<p>The order from the Ministry was received regarding the organization of the joint examination.</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Education of Shanghai Municipality is organizing a joint examination for the graduation of students from middle and primary schools in this session. In order to assess the students' performance, the Bureau has decided to send personnel to supervise the high school examinations and hold joint examinations for primary and secondary schools. The Bureau is actively handling the matter and has submitted the measures to the Ministry of Education. The Ministry has now issued an order stating that the intention is very good and the measures should be slightly revised. For example, physics, chemistry, and biology in high school should also be supervised. The supervised subjects in vocational schools should be the subjects they specialize in. The natural subjects in the junior high school joint examination seem to be too light. It is heard that the Bureau of Education's proposed measures originally placed greater emphasis on junior high school this session. As a matter of fact, for the first time, the physics and other three subjects in the high school examination should also be supervised or a joint examination should be held. The supervised subjects in vocational schools will be handled this session according to the subjects emphasized by each school, and will not be the same as ordinary high schools. The percentages of subjects in junior high school are calculated according to the number of credits for each subject in the junior high school three-year program of the provisional standards of the secondary school curriculum issued by the Ministry. All methods can be further improved for the next examination.</p>
<h3>The Sixth Anniversary and Graduation Ceremony of Great China University</h3>
<p>The sixth anniversary celebration of Great China University was originally scheduled to be held at the new campus in Fanwangdu on the morning of the 14th. Due to the rain, it was temporarily changed to be held at the Jiaozhou Road Auditorium on the afternoon of the same day, together with the graduation ceremony. More than 2,000 guests, teachers and students of the school entered the venue in an orderly manner at 1:30 PM. President Wang Boqun delivered the opening speech, stating that the school has relied on the cooperation of teachers and students internally and the support of society externally for the past six years. The progress from thatched cottages to Great China University can be said to be rapid. However, the foundation has just been laid, and there are many constructions to be done. He hoped that all colleagues in the school would redouble their efforts, that worthy people in the country would actively support the school, and that the graduates would not slacken their responsibilities to the country, society, and the school. Then, Vice President Ou Yuanhuai reported on the establishment of the school and described the school's future development plan, stating that the school is currently building a large classroom and three male and female dormitories, with construction costs and land reaching 500,000 yuan. In the near future, an independent science museum and library will also need to be built, and it is planned to raise a fund of 5 million yuan. Based on the past history of the school, this is not a difficult task. However, this only refers to material construction. The focus of university education is still on psychological construction. In the future, our school should strive for the following three kinds of psychological construction: (1) cultivation of sound personality, (2) cultivation of true knowledge and practical learning, and (3) identification and training of leadership talents. Next, Cai Yuanpei gave a speech, stating that Great China University is the most advanced and rapidly progressing private university, and the implementation of the tutor system is especially the first to open up the atmosphere of universities in the country. The tutor system is highly valued by educators in European and American countries. Next, school director Yang Xingfo gave a speech, stating that university graduates should strive to serve in the social production field and should not aim to become officials. Next, school director Zhao Jinqing gave a speech, describing his feelings after visiting the Far East Games in Japan and deducing that the reason why the Japanese country is thriving is entirely due to diligence and frugality. He hoped that everyone would not forget the two words diligence and frugality. After the speeches, President Wang presented the degree certificates and awarded various prizes. Then, the graduates presented souvenirs to the alma mater, and Wu Jingxiao gave a speech on behalf of the graduates. Finally, everyone sang the school song. The ceremony was extremely solemn. This time, there were a total of 43 graduates from various undergraduate colleges, 35 from the senior normal program, and 76 from the preparatory course. Their names are listed below (College of Liberal Arts): Zhu Guangxin, Wu Jingxiao, Lin Quanyi, Qiu Jinyin, Xu Daoping, Xu Jisu, Sun Weile, Ma Canhao, Chen Qing, Chen Shengleng, Chen Shuguang, Zhang Daoren, Zhang Yuanhe, Zhang Yi, Lu Chuntai, Ye Xushu, Zhao Zhengxiong (College of Science): Wu Tinggen, Zhang Lianzong, Qian Zhengfeng (College of Education): Wang Gengyang, Li Xubin, He Yuanqing, Lin Diesheng, Ke Chaozhen, Tang Shiming, Cao Ziqin, Cui Zhongying, Huang Naihong, Huang Mingsheng, Xi Xian, Liu Yuanpeng, Zheng Shouyu (College of Commerce): Wu Yingti, Lin Maoxiang, Yao Xingnan, Sun Xingyuan, Sun Shiju, Chen Deyou, Zhang Changchang, Deng Guihua (College of Law): Chen Xinghua, Yang Huilong, Yan Hanqing (Advanced Normal Training Program): Wang Tong, Wang Zizhi, Zhu Guanglan, Yi Guangyuan, Li Baida, Zhou Shifu, Hu Shijun, Xu Dezhao, Yuan Bolun, Ma Zhaokui, Ma Chengxiang, Gao Jian, Chen Qishao, Chen Wenhua, Chen Guming, Zhang Junkun, Zhang Zhijin, Zhang Juyu, Yin Tangkang, Shiheng Cheng, Shaoji Feng, Bing Huang, Buying Huang, Benkang Lei, Jingshan Dong, Ganquan Meng, Juecun Ye, Yunlin Ye, Weicai Ye, Chuang Liu, Xiuyu Jiang, Tinglong Pan, Zonggang Xie, Xin Zhugeren</p>
<h3>Grand Celebration of the Commercial College of Jinan University</h3>
<p>Parade was Enthusiastic, Entertainment was Splendid, Joyful Sounds Lasted Until Dawn</p>
<p>The Middle School Department Held an Art Exhibition Simultaneously</p>
<p>The tenth-anniversary ceremony, prepared by the Commercial College of National Jinan University, was held yesterday. Alumni gathered, and distinguished guests arrived, creating a grand and lively event. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Venue Decoration: Two days before the event, a high archway was erected in front of the school gate, with the inscription "Tenth Anniversary of the Commercial College" and "Welcome Guests" inlaid in the center. Beside the gate, a freehand painting was displayed, also expressing welcome to alumni and guests. It was colorful and eye-catching. Both sides of the road leading to the entrance were decorated with colored ribbons on the trees, creating a beautiful scene. Guidance signs were placed along the way. Several rooms in the Science Hall were used to display flowers and fruits, and receptionists welcomed guests separately. Zhiyuan Hall was the venue for the ceremony. Various gifts from individuals and organizations, such as silver shields and screens, and inscribed scrolls were displayed in front of the stage, creating a dazzling and captivating scene.</p>
<p>(2) Enthusiastic Parade: First, the entire parade gathered in the open space in front of the school. Faculty and alumni wore formal attire, while students each wore a colorful paper hat, creating a truly interesting scene. At that moment, a train happened to stop at the Zhenru Station, and passengers all leaned out of the windows, cheering in unison. Guests also joined the parade. Boy Scouts led the way on bicycles. As the cannon sounded, the military music began, and the procession moved forward one after another. Firecrackers exploded continuously, their sound reaching the clouds, creating a scene of joyful frenzy.</p>
<p>(3) Solemn Flag Raising: After parading around for a week, the procession reached the auditorium (Zhiyuan Hall), where they lined up to perform the flag-raising ceremony. President Zheng pulled the rope, and Vice President Hong delivered the flag. At the same time, border cannons were fired, and shouts of "Long live the Republic of China! Long live the Kuomintang! Long live Jinan University! Long live the Commercial College!" were heard. A group photo was taken.</p>
<p>(4) Grand Ceremony: After the flag raising, everyone entered the auditorium as the Western orchestra played music. The seats were filled with people. The ceremony was conducted according to protocol. President Zheng, as chairman, delivered the opening address, first recounting the hardships of establishing the school and the motivation for establishing the Commercial College, differentiating it from other commercial colleges. He stated that the school aimed to promote communication, revitalization, and development of commerce in Central and South China. He then discussed the significance of the anniversary, emphasizing that it was not only a celebration but also an opportunity to review the achievements of the past ten years, continue efforts based on established plans, and strive to improve for the future. He also acknowledged the contributions of past directors of the college, such as Gao Jian, Pan Xulun, and the current director, Yang Ru, to the college. Director Yang then discussed the history of the college and the implementation after becoming the director, such as (1) holding more college affairs meetings, (2) increasing the level of difficulty and the amount of reference materials and internships, (3) strictly enforcing examinations, (4) adding English diaries, (5) establishing the Jinan University Bank, and (6) preparing for the Commercial Investigation Department. Then, guests were invited to speak.</p>
<p>(5) Speech by Chen Dezheng, Representative of the Ministry of Education: Chen Dezheng, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, was dispatched by the Ministry of Education to attend and deliver a speech, stating that a common phenomenon in China is specializing in foreign studies without understanding China. We should be aware of the need to carefully study domestic affairs, especially those studying at the Commercial College of Jinan University, and should understand their own position and the importance of their responsibilities. He respectfully offered a small gift on behalf of the Ministry: (1) a spirit of perseverance, (2) diligence and conscientiousness, and (3) attention to domestic commercial information, hoping that Jinan University would become more substantial, more complete, and progress infinitely.</p>
<p>(6) Speech by Ye Gongchuo: He first expressed his congratulations and then stated that the people's livelihood in the country is extremely difficult, and the situation is alarming. Since the European War, the whole world has been affected, and we must find ways to open up opportunities to compensate for the losses. How to escape the dangerous period depends on knowledgeable, opinionated, and capable people to engage in construction. Today's commemoration is not the same as an ordinary birthday but has certain things and responsibilities that you should start from today. In the future, the 20th or 30th anniversary will be even more meaningful.</p>
<p>(7) Speech by Wang Zemin, Representative of the Training Supervision Department: He stated that overseas Chinese, when they first arrive overseas, have no government to rely on and no organization. However, there is a very good phenomenon in commerce. No wonder foreigners criticize us for being talented. If we use scientific methods to study, we can control the competition in the commercial field. He then spoke about the meaning of militarization because the school strictly implements military education.</p>
<p>(8) Speech by Lin Bingwen, Representative of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce: He stated that there are many imported goods, and there are also many unemployed people in the country. How should we provide relief? He hoped that everyone would (1) strive to be enterprising and (2) concentrate wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>(9) Abundant Entertainment: Starting at 1:00 PM, the entertainment continued in Zhiyuan Hall, with over 1,500 spectators. The program included: 1. "Human Face Peach Blossom" (Ms. Zhang Suzhen), 2. Dance (Ms. Li Yuexian and Li Zhixian), 3. "Farewell Violet Dance," "Red Rose Dance," "Butterfly Dance" (Butterfly Dance Troupe), 4. Cantonese Music (Chinese Music Association), 5. "Temporary Doctor" (students from this college), 6. "Partner Dance" (Ms. Zhang Jinwen and Liu Xiaowo), 7. "Nonsense Talk" (Xie Yushen and Ma Xinggan from this school), 8. "Awakening" (Charleston (American Club)), 9. "Little Painter" (Nanyang Dance Troupe), 10. English Solo (Ms. Li Hangsu, a graduate of Guanghua University and the fiancée of Mr. Wang Weisi). All were extremely wonderful. The remaining programs cannot be listed in detail.</p>
<p>(10) Dinner and Celebration: At 7:00 PM, a dinner was held at the Dadong Restaurant in this city. About 300 new and old faculty members and guests of the college gathered together. The entire Western orchestra came to the scene to add to the elegance. After being seated, the Party Song and School Song were sung first. President Zheng stood up to deliver a speech, stating that the dinner was intended to celebrate the school and for teachers and students to enjoy themselves. He said that he was very happy about the large number of people present today. He recalled that when the students returned to China, they were selected by Mr. Qian Nianqu. Although "Overseas Chinese Education" was founded by him, he could not forget his contributions. Representatives of the Capital Alumni Association, Gu Yufang, representative of the Shanghai Alumni Association, Wang Weiyi, and Dean of the Education College, Xie Xun, followed, delivering speeches and adding to the fun. The party ended at 10:30 PM, and they took the 11:00 PM night express train back to Zhenru School. The lights were not turned off until about 12:00 AM because the joy of returning to school had not subsided, and joyful sounds lasted until dawn.</p>
<p>(11) Art Exhibition: The middle school department of the school simultaneously held an art exhibition yesterday. The venue was in the two rows of classrooms in front of the temporary dormitory. More than 400 paintings from the teacher training department and the junior high school were displayed. Teacher Xu Shaozeng provided a lot of guidance and created many excellent works. The best of the handicrafts were the pottery. The viewers praised them highly. The exhibition will continue today for one day to welcome art lovers from the outside world to visit.</p>
<h3>General Assembly of the Yinzhang District Education Association</h3>
<p>The Yinzhang District Teachers' Association of this city held a general meeting of members at Yucai Elementary School on Linping Road at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 15th). Jin Huazao, Lu Jingtan, and Feng Guangjia were publicly elected as the presidium, and Guo Qisheng recorded the proceedings. After the ceremony, Chairman Jin Huazao first reported on the work situation in the past six months. Then, the resolutions were discussed and decided: (1) To issue a declaration supporting the Municipal Education Bureau's recovery of education rights in the concessions; (2) To request the Education Bureau to add a junior high school within the Yinzhang District; (3) To convene a general meeting of members one week after the start of the next school year to re-elect the executive committee. Finally, Inspector Ma of the Municipal Education Bureau gave an earnest speech, and the meeting adjourned at noon.</p>
<p>Sports</p>
<h3>Guangdong Women's Normal School Team Goes to Suzhou</h3>
<p>Departing today to compete with Huiling and Jinghai</p>
<p>Welcome to hold friendly matches with various teams</p>
<p>The Northern-bound team from the Guangdong Provincial First Women's Normal School originally planned to go to Nanjing on the 14th. However, after receiving replies from various schools, most schools could not participate in the competition due to examinations. It is heard that the team has decided not to go to Nanjing and instead arranged to compete with Huiling and Jinghai schools in Suzhou. Both schools have agreed to the baseball match. Therefore, the women's normal school team is scheduled to take the train to Suzhou today, the 16th. At that time, they may arrange to compete with other schools in volleyball, basketball, and tennis.</p>
<p>Also, the Northern-bound team has four teams for volleyball, basketball, tennis, and mallet ball. It is said that in order to seek artistic progress, they do not avoid traveling far to Jiangsu and Zhejiang and intend to hold various competitions with various teams to strengthen ties and promote communication. The address for communication is the Northern-bound team of the Women's Normal School, East Asia Hotel, Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>This Year's Volleyball League</p>
<h3>Southern Lion Shakes Shanghai</h3>
<p>Won Championships in Both A and B Groups丨</p>
<p>This year's Shanghai Volleyball League included a total of fifteen teams in Groups A and B. For a time, celebrities from the sea gathered together. Among the Groups A and B, there was a so-called Southern Lion Team, which was the transformed Fudan University volleyball team. Wherever they went, their opponents were defeated. Yesterday, the league concluded, and both Groups A and B won the championships. The fame of the Southern Lion has been greatly shaken in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Record of the Southern Lion Winning the Championship in Group A</h3>
<p>Daxia and Southern Lion met in the final of Group A after defeating other teams. Xie Baochang's smash for Southern Lion opened the record for the two teams. Before long, they gained a lead of three to one. Xie's serve was urgent and powerful, adding three more points. Daxia's fighting spirit was weakened, and their formation was chaotic. The three generals of Southern Lion's second row looked down from above, and their number of smashes was endless. Moreover, their offensive positions were unpredictable. Thus, they soared upwards and soon reached a score of eleven to two. After the court was switched, Daxia's military appearance gradually strengthened. Once, when Liang Zhunan was serving, the entire army advanced. Although Southern Lion was strong, it also changed color. Daxia scored a total of six points in one fell swoop, creating a score of eight to fifteen. The cycle of prosperity and decline continued. Southern Lion completed the final game in one breath, winning the first game with a score of twenty-one to eight. From the second game, Daxia had an amazing performance, leading repeatedly with great fighting spirit. From the equal score of five to five, Southern Lion was late to show their power, resulting in a mutual holding situation with little difference. Southern Lion took the lead with eleven to eight. Since then, Daxia's momentum has weakened and gradually declined, while Southern Lion, with victory in sight, had a hundred times the courage. They first took the lead with fourteen to nine and then formed a distance of sixteen to nine. Finally, they ended the game with twenty-one to ten. Southern Lion won two games in a row and won the Group A championship. Captain Cao Tingzan arrived late. Seeing that his team's situation was very good, it seemed unnecessary to participate, so he changed into a spectator. Referee: Li Feiyun</p>

<h3>Southern Lion's Struggle for Supremacy in Group B</h3>
<p>The two teams competing for supremacy in the Group B final were Southern Lion and Fugang. Their strength was known to be strong. A dramatic battle was expected. However, Fugang was quite strong at first, taking the lead with a score of two to zero. Before long, Southern Lion caught up, and the army's morale was disrupted, and the situation was greatly deteriorated. They lost the first half with a score of three to eleven. Although they revived slightly, it was still difficult to improve. They finally lost the first game with a score of eight to twenty-one. In the second game, the two sides fought fiercely. From the general trend, Fugang had a good chance of winning, but unfortunately, their serve was poor, and they still failed. At first, Fugang completed six points in one breath. Southern Lion gradually progressed to an equal score of seven to seven. Before long, Fugang</p>
<p>won the first half with a score of eleven to seven. After changing formation, Southern Lion worked hard and actually created an advantage of eighteen to thirteen. Fugang also stepped up their efforts and became eighteen again. At that time, the air was tense, and the situation was serious. Each other had made constructions, and it was difficult to distinguish between them. The most victory was as if it was hanging in the air, and it was unknown who the quick winner was. Fortunately, God blessed Southern Lion, who finally won with a score of twenty-three to twenty-one. Southern Lion won the championship.</p>

<h3>Yunnan Miao People, Xiong Peng</h3>
<p>In recent years, the country has been at war, and remote border areas have often been neglected. There is no accurate investigation of the current situation, and the legends and records are often inaccurate. Those who care about border affairs regret this very much. The other day, I obtained some information about the Miao people in Yunnan from a certain gentleman, which is quite noteworthy. Since the Pianma negotiation, the Chinese people have long forgotten about Yunnan. However, the region is rich in resources. Now, the British are coveting it from the west, and the French are coveting it from the south, working hard to achieve their goals. The gentleman has been in Yunnan for many years and is very familiar with the affairs of the Miao people. The Miao people are often referred to as barbarians and uncivilized, but they are not. The affairs of the Miao people are surprising, but the Chinese people do not observe them. Now, I will pick up what the gentleman said to share with readers.</p>
<p>The customs and habits of the Miao people are cautious and simple, and the race is extremely complex. The Miao people account for one-half of the population. They are honest and fond of singing and dancing, not as fierce and strong in obedience as the legends say. The wedding period is all in March. First, men and women gather to sing and dance, and then they choose a spouse and marry, as the rumors say.</p>
<p>As for farmland, the Miao people's land cannot be sold. Everyone has a fixed number. In areas with famine, the whole community provides for them. This is the implementation of public land ownership, without the drawbacks of large landlords, which is more advanced than us.</p>
<p>The Miao women are very admirable. Now, almost one-half of the entire province of Yunnan is addicted to opium, but not a single Miao man is addicted, which is all due to the Miao women. According to their custom, if an unmarried Miao man has an opium addiction, all the Miao women will despise him and refuse to marry him. If a married Miao man is addicted, his wife will consider it a great shame and will definitely commit suicide.</p>
<p>Yunnan has many schools, but very few Miao people come to study. Chinese education is not suitable for their nature, and the teachers cannot adapt. As a result, the British and French have been able to take the opportunity to establish dance halls as schools and then use 26 letters and the Miao language to teach them in songs and dances. Therefore, they have gained the trust of the Miao people. The Miao people are inherently obedient. The intentions of the British and French are clear.</p>
<p>Now, the British and French forces have deeply penetrated into the interior. Railways and schools are being built with all their strength, regarding Yunnan as a subsidiary of Burma. This is a hidden danger at the side of our bed, which is a hidden disease under our arm. The Chinese people should pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>A Record of Farewell in the Rain, Fufeng Sanlang</h3>
<p>I live in an office in Zhabei, and I rely on the tram to go back and forth to the Bund in the morning and evening. However, I usually walk in the Chinese concession section. This is due to diligence in exercise and limited economy. The other day, it rained heavily, and the streets were all wet. The roads in Hubei are usually already full of gravel and difficult to walk on. After a rain, they are covered with mud, making it even more difficult to walk step by step. Due to economic constraints, I had to hold an umbrella in one hand and cover my clothes with the other, walking in the rain. I was sighing at the difficulty of walking when a motorcycle whizzed past. The wheels splashed mud everywhere. My semi-old shirt was already wet from the rain and looked mottled and unsightly. My entire shirt was covered. Looking back, the car was already dozens of paces away. I only saw the backs of a couple in brocade clothes through the car window. There was nothing to negotiate, so I had to blame myself for being unlucky, why I didn't take the car and walked in the rain.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Japanese Pigeon Breeding Method, Ji Qin</h3>
<p>Recently, a friend returned from Japan and talked about the Japanese raising pigeons specifically for delivering letters. According to a recent survey, there are as many as 26,400 pigeons in the Tokyo area, and other places such as Kobe, Osaka, Hiroshima, and Nagoya are not far behind. This astonishing number has increased over the years, which is beyond our estimation. Now, I will briefly describe the pigeon breeding method to readers.</p>
<p>Selection of Varieties: Pigeons have four colors: white, black, gray, and flower. White is the best. Its fur is tight, its eyes are slightly red, its neck is strong, its back is wide, its tail is short, its body is light, and when it flaps its wings, it makes a rustling sound. It can travel more than 30 miles per hour without stopping, which is beyond the reach of other pigeons. The value of each pair is about 5 or 6 yen. The Japanese have specially built a cage for them to live in and take care of them carefully, so as not to associate with ordinary pigeons, lest their nature change. However, the three types of black, gray, and flower are not necessarily inferior to white. Even if there are outstanding pigeons, they are only ranked in the second and third class due to different likes and dislikes.</p>
<p>Training Facilities: The quality of pigeons cannot be observed. At least two or three months after birth can its quality be determined. The superior ones are naturally lively and can be trained to do whatever people want. Usually, in addition to delivering letters, they are also taught various games. The inferior ones are not like this. Whether they are lured with food or threatened, they do not see success after years of work. The Japanese, out of anger, often kill and eat them, which is not a pity. It is said that there was a man named Okayama Yoshitaro who was good at raising pigeons. He specially built a dining room. When the siren sounded, the pigeons flew in and took their seats according to their positions without making any mistakes. However, the stupid ones among them did not know why and often starved to death. Although the matter is interesting, it can also be seen as a glimpse of strict training.</p>
<h3>Romantic Tidbits, Yunlang</h3>
<p>The meaning of the English word "Romance" is initially not the same as what we Chinese call romance. The original meaning of romance is the development of anti-classical individualism, and it is not enough to talk about "romance" without high-level attainments. However, our people do not distinguish between jade and stones, and they regard "romance" as a malicious term, leading to misunderstandings, such as the Shanghai saying "tear down the rotten shed." It is truly the misfortune of "romance."</p>
<p>Looking for romantic figures in our country's history, Tao Qian and Li Bai are relatively similar. If we look for it in "Dream of the Red Chamber," the romantic girl is not Xiren but Shi Xiangyun.</p>
<p>Yu Meiyan is also called a romantic woman. Judging from her thoughts, there is something to be appreciated. Judging from her actions, there is no lack of excess.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that Mingxing Film Company has just started filming a film called "Romantic Woman," starring Ms. Xuan Jinglin. The plot is extremely tortuous and lively, describing a love drama in the social world. It focuses on the psychological changes and environmental temptations and oppressions of a romanticized woman. The romantic woman in this film was initially a social flower, then became a female student at an art school, becoming a female artist. However, she then suffered misfortune, falling into a big gambling den. Finally, unable to bear the vicissitudes of life, she became a madman and entered a mental hospital. The changes and twists are extremely intricate and touching. In recent times, the customs of the people have been deteriorating. This film may be able to subtly criticize while being lively.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Travelogue (30) Linghua</h3>
<p>On the 23rd, Yangzheng Principal Fu Weizhou invited Huang Chaonan, Chen Zishi, Zhang Dengsan, and others to travel to Johor. Johor is now a protectorate and still has a king. It is only a small county with a population of hundreds of thousands and a mosque. The king here is named Sultan, all of which are Muslim names. We passed through a large iron bridge to cross the strait. It is said that this bridge cost more than ten million yuan to build. There are police officers inspecting the border, which is also like a country. However, the palace is like our small county government and cannot match the scale of our university. It is said that it was built by our Chinese businessman, Mr. Huang. I wanted to visit the king and queen through Mr. Huang, but the king and queen were both in England. The other concubines are not influential. According to Johor, it was Luo Huo in the Yuan Dynasty. The Yuan history records its origin. At that time, it was a land of daughters like Java.</p>
<p>On the 24th, I visited friends from the Kuomintang. According to them, they are currently negotiating with the local government because the British government prohibits Kuomintang activities. This matter affects the freedom of the Kuomintang in all British territories. According to one British argument, on the surface, the Kuomintang has not been formally registered with the government, but in fact, it is said that they are afraid that there will be progressive members mixed in the Kuomintang. Because of the great chaos in the country, they are preventing radical factions from coming south together, using the Kuomintang to carry out activities that would hinder public security. If the original Kuomintang had always had no major conflicts with the British government. This may be the British overthinking and being paranoid.</p>
<p>On the 25th, a friend who was in the pawnshop business suddenly went bankrupt, with two companies going bankrupt in succession, each with hundreds of thousands of dollars. This was due to the poor commercial situation. Those who had deposits in the pawnshop all suffered losses or were completely wiped out. The society was very panicked for a while. According to a friend in the Bankruptcy Office, in the past, no more than 200 stores went bankrupt each year. This year, in the three months since spring, 380 have gone bankrupt. It is difficult to say what will happen in the future. The Bankruptcy Office is in charge of store bankruptcies, which is also the Bankruptcy Office. After reporting bankruptcy, the individual's activities are suspended. They are not allowed to take cars, first-class trams, or wear white clothes. Western customs regard white clothes as upper-class. Those who violate the rules will be punished by detectives. If they want to cancel this unfreedom, they must repay the old debts before they can recover. Although this is only a matter of law, in fact, there are often cunning people who falsely report bankruptcy and secretly give their property to their wives and children. In law, it is their wives' and children's property, and in the future, it will be difficult to punish them if they travel in their wives' and children's cars. From this, it can be seen that the law also has its limits.</p>

<p>Mr. Gu Mingdao's novel, "Female Knight of the Wilderness River," has sold very well. Now, it has been adapted into a movie by the Youlian Film Company and is currently being screened at the Central Grand Theater, which is full every day. This is because the company has a reputation for producing martial arts films, and Ms. Xu Qinfang's literary and martial arts skills are fully focused on this, making it even more complementary.</p>
<p>The advantage of the film "Female Knight of the Wilderness River" is that it does not follow the current trends, but only focuses on the tightness of the scenes, making people feel aftertaste and need to watch the sequel. Therefore, the business income of the two episodes of the film is better in the second episode than in the first episode.</p>
<p>It is said that the third and fourth episodes will also be released next month, and Mingdao also has a sequel, so the sequels will continue to be released and will be extremely popular.</p>
<p>The martial arts in the film may be borrowed, but the real swords and guns fighting on the stage require real skill. Ms. Xu and Shang Guanwu's expressions when fighting with swords in the Natural Theater are truly like dragons soaring and tigers leaping. But if you are not careful, you will be injured. Ms. Xu and others would not be able to achieve this without real kung fu. Therefore, the audience praises them, and the realism of the scenery and the wonderfulness of the children's music are just extras.</p>

<h3>Heart's Warmth (212) by Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Twelfth Chapter: Farewell Banquet and Parting Feast, Flowers Retain Her Fair Image, Elegant Gathering in a Famous Garden, Competing in Tea Tasting to Behold Her Charming Figure</p>
<p>The eldest aunt repeatedly spoke with Ruiyun, trying to arrange things for her and make plans for her, as if wanting to please her and make her feel satisfied. Ruiyun seemed not to pay much attention, neither strongly refusing nor greatly approving, leaving the eldest aunt bewildered. She thought that Ruiyun was, after all, just a young girl, and was still vague about her lifelong affairs, but marrying into such a family, she would have done right by her. The eldest aunt also thought that Ruiyun might not be willing to say anything in front of her mother, or perhaps she might reveal her feelings in front of others. She thought that Zuo Shichen had watched Ruiyun grow up since she was a child, so perhaps she would be willing to tell him some of the truth. Therefore, she deliberately walked back and forth in the room, trying to overhear some of their conversation, and also deliberately interjected, gradually talking about how this marriage was a rare opportunity for Ruiyun. But who knew that Ruiyun didn't even want to listen, only changing the subject to other things. If she continued to nag, Ruiyun would be ready to walk away to the back room. In reality, Zuo Shichen also didn't know whether to feel happy or sad in his heart, and was just like the eldest aunt, as if he "couldn't grasp the monk's head." On the way home in the car that day, he thought that women's psychology was often unpredictable. Ruiyun, who had never even read a single book since she was a child, could be considered an uneducated girl. Having been bought away from a young age, she had experienced hardships and suffered all kinds of bitterness. Then, she was sold into prostitution and enjoyed material prosperity. But this year, she was only sixteen years old, just a girl, yet it seemed that she had closed the "golden door of her heart," making it impossible for people to open it no matter how many times they knocked. It was truly somewhat mysterious and unbelievable. Then he thought that tomorrow's meal, no matter what, he must gently open the golden door of her heart that was usually nine parts closed out of ten. By the time he arrived home, it was already two o'clock in the morning. His wife had already put the children to sleep. Zuo Shichen felt that Ruiyun's marriage made him feel happy, but at the same time, some sour and melancholy feelings were mixed in with that happiness. A night passed, and the next day at three o'clock in the afternoon, he went out. He stopped by the Yizhixiang Western Restaurant and reserved a small room. Originally, Yizhixiang had a small room in the eastern corner of the upper floor. Their regular customers often invited a few friends to play cards in that small room, just enough for a table. Although the place was small, it was very quiet. The waiters said, "Is this room okay?" Zuo Shichen reserved it. At six o'clock, he called Qinghefang to speak to A Jin. A Jin said, "We'll come around seven thirty because we have to go to a few places to sing. Their game hasn't ended yet. We'll definitely be there by eight o'clock."</p>

<h3>Observations on the Call Money Rate on Financial Sundays</h3>
<p>Call money rises by one and a half percent, easing and harmonizing</p>
<p>Yesterday was the usual Sunday, and banks were closed as usual, so the money market was quiet. The foreign exchange rate rose because the money supply was very loose and there were many buyers. The morning rate was 71.65 per tael, and the afternoon rate continued to rise by 1 percent to 71.75 per tael. As a result, it was 1.5 percent higher than the morning rate of the previous day. The silver interest rate was 8 percent in both the morning and afternoon, a world of difference compared to the 5-6 percent silver interest rate of the previous week. The volume of foreign exchange transactions was 655,000 taels in the morning and 545,000 taels in the afternoon. The volume of banknotes was 20,000 taels in the morning and 40,000 taels in the afternoon. Outside the market, the volume of banknotes was 65,000 taels in the morning and 45,000 taels in the afternoon. The amount of silver collected by money shops was over 6.4 million taels, and the amount of silver collected by public shops was over 48 million taels. Because the day was the 15th, the amount of silver collected by public shops was more complicated. The transaction volume of small money shops was over 300,000 taels. The market conditions for auxiliary coins were as follows: Jiangnan small coins were 63.35 per 1000 cash in the morning and 63.5 per 1000 cash in the afternoon. The transaction volume was 5,000 corners in the morning and 3,000 corners in the afternoon. Guangdong small coins were 59.35 per 1000 cash in the morning and 59.5 per 1000 cash in the afternoon. The transaction volume was 115,000 corners in the morning and 90,000 corners in the afternoon. The price of copper coins fell by 2,000 cash to 4,080,000 cash.</p>
<h3>Spot Gold Prices Turn Stable After a Fall Last Week</h3>
<p>Gold exchange limits buying and selling amounts</p>
<p>Authorities propose relief measures</p>
<p>3.7 taels lower than the previous weekend</p>
<p>The falling silver price trend is still not contained</p>
<p>As swap deals are about to expire, entries and exits are slightly clearer. Last week, the spot gold market was in a state of latent weakness, seemingly a reaction after repeated increases. However, the waves were turbulent and the dynamics were very drastic, with fluctuations of more than ten taels per day, making people feel confused and disoriented. However, the trading volume among the industry was not large, mostly because swap deals were approaching expiration. Especially with the trend of expensive gold and cheap silver becoming more tense, the authorities proposed relief measures. As a result, speculators became more cautious and did not dare to overdo it. However, the falling trend of silver prices in the British and American markets was still not contained. Exchange rates fluctuated from time to time, but ultimately remained strong, really because payments for foreign rice and military supplies were frequent. As for speculation, there were also settlements to hedge. However, the exchange rate calculated with spot gold was far from the price of drafts. The spot gold market has been flooded in recent days, so its price has been increasing by more than three taels per period since the beginning of the week. The seventh month has suddenly broken through the 560 tael mark, once reaching 556.6 taels, since the silver market rose on Tuesday and drafts also rose. By the middle of the week, the silver price suddenly shrank and drafts changed, suddenly breaking through the 580 tael mark and reaching 581.8 taels. By the weekend, it began to show a peaceful and seemingly stable sign, having fallen sharply by 3.7 taels compared to the previous weekend. The following is a summary of the situation for the past five days:</p>
<p>The whole week had fluctuations of 25 taels. On June 10 (Tuesday), the large bar had no electricity and the silver price continued to rise, and the exchange rate also rose. The intraday market was loose and the spot gold price opened at 573.5 taels, falling by five or six taels, then rebounding by more than three taels. The afternoon market suddenly fell to 56.6 taels as large households tended to sell off. With the activity of buyers, it broke through the 60 tael mark again, closing at 66.7 taels, but still falling 12 taels compared to the previous Saturday. On that day, the fluctuations were more than 20 taels. The next morning was weak and the afternoon was firm, because the silver bar continued to rise and the exchange rate rose. However, the intraday market was loose to tight, and the gold price fluctuated unpredictably with a difference of 16 taels. In the morning, sellers were still strong and it was reported that the authorities were planning to temporarily suspend the exchange, causing panic. It then fell to 57.1 taels. In the afternoon, Xianling and others were quite strong and had already escaped the 70 tael mark. On Thursday, the market situation suddenly reached a high point, having broken through the 80 tael mark, because the large bar suddenly lowered and drafts suddenly shrank by three gears. The industry was full of closures and the Xianling market atmosphere was auspicious, but it was chaotic and there were no large transactions in the market. Because the firm members believed that the price was fluctuating too much, they planned to limit the number of transactions each broker could carry over from today's swap in order to ensure safety and avoid danger. Later, the final price was only 569.2 taels, falling more than two taels compared to the previous day. On Friday, the large bar repeatedly shrank and the exchange rate did not change. The internal market was slightly stronger and the gold market went up, but there were also fluctuations of about ten taels. By (Saturday), the silver price was lower again and the large bar did not move. The Xianling exchange rate shrank by one gear and the spot gold was still considered sharp, at 76-77 taels. However, the swap deal had expired and there were no transactions. The final result was 75.35 taels, with a difference of only 3.4 taels between the high and low prices during the day, a drop of 3.7 taels compared to (the previous weekend). The difference between the high and low prices this week was 25.2 taels, but the storms were not as fierce as in the previous week. The following is a table of the high and low prices of British and American silver markets and drafts:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Compared to Last Saturday</p>
<p>Large Bar Near 16 pence 875 16 pence 1875 Reduced by 335</p>

<h3>The Shrinking Silver Price Trend is Frightening</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday. A telegram from London said that the falling trend of silver bars was still fierce. The near-term price had shrunk by 3125 and retreated into the 16 pence mark, to 15 pence 875 (equivalent to 1 shilling 6.75 pence in English gold). The distant-term price had shrunk by 375, to 15 pence 625. Both China and India were selling, and the market was unstable. A telegram from New York said that the American silver price had also shrunk by 875, with the spot price at 3.4 dollars. English to American had fallen by 0.03125 to 4 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen 875. American to English had also fallen by 0.03125 to 4 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen 90625. Japanese to American had risen by 0.0625 to 49 yuan 5 jiao. English to English was still calculated at 1 shilling 6.75 pence. Bombay had shrunk by 9 ounces, with the spot price calculated at 46 rupees 01 ounce.</p>
<h3>Bond Market Trends Slightly Flat Last Week</h3>
<p>Transactions of 5.33 Million</p>
<p>During the past week, the bond market in this port was bustling, and the futures market was very lively in the first half of the week, with brisk buying and selling. Monday opened with 1.11 million, Tuesday with 1.3 million, and Wednesday with 9.8 million. The market was slightly calmer and quieter in the second half of the week. Transactions on Thursday totaled 6.44 million, transactions on Friday totaled 6.8 million, and transactions on Saturday totaled only 5.8 million, for a total of 53.195 million for the entire week, a decrease of more than 12.5 million from the previous week. Among them, the consolidation bond was the most popular, with 9.785 million for the June contract and 11.595 million for the July contract. The others were not as good as before. The customs duty bond was 6.39 million for the June contract and 7.64 million for the July contract. The demobilization bond was 2.945 million for the June contract and 3.705 million for the July contract. The rehabilitation bond was 2.055 million for the June contract and 3.22 million for the July contract. The Consolidation 6 bond was 1.195 million for the June contract and 1.59 million for the July contract. The Continued Roll bond was 685,000 for the June contract and 1.91 million for the July contract. The spot market was still idle, with a total of 131,000 transactions, including 36,000 for the consolidation bond, 28,000 for the continued large bond, and 23,000 for the Consolidation 6 bond. The rehabilitation, financial, and customs duty bonds each had tens of thousands, and the others only had thousands. The overall environment of the bond market last week was calm, and the mood of the market was changing from active to quiet. In the first two days of the week, due to the temporary relationship between supply and demand, there were huge entries and exits of various bonds in the market, rising and falling by several yuan. Although the market situation was strong on Wednesday, the bond prices were already in a state of tranquility. The situation became increasingly calm between Thursday and Friday, and the supply and demand situation remained balanced. Although bond prices often rose more than they fell every day, the trend was always very stable and the fluctuations were very small. The weekend started out calmly, but in the front and back markets, the consolidation and demobilization bonds were sold more actively, causing the price to fall by about 1.5 yuan. The others were all lowered, resulting in a continued drop of more than one yuan for the consolidation and demobilization bonds, while other bonds had mutual gains and losses, only by about half a yuan. The following is a statistical table of the high and low prices and gains and losses of various bonds last week (unit: yuan): Bond Type Period/Spot Highest Week Lowest Week Amount Gain/Loss Consolidation 6 Spot 67.00 366.00 41.00 Rose by 1.20</p>

<h3>Changes in the Yarn Market Last Week</h3>
<p>Lack of Potential for Rise</p>
<p>Spot and Futures Fall Together Except for One or Two Taels</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the yarn market was agitated due to the surge in gold prices and the strange shrinkage of foreign exchange rates. The market rose sharply and the situation was extremely sharp. Bullish traders took the opportunity to push up the market, and there was a tendency to continue to rise. Before long, the exchange market slightly loosened and the overall situation changed again. The war was fierce and real sales stagnated. All parties were affected by the military, business was cut off, and the market quickly tended to fall. Fortunately, raw cotton was stable and the yarn market was able to maintain for a while. However, the environment in the four gardens was too bad. Although overseas third-grade yarn was related to the exchange rate, the falling trend was very strong. However, the attitude of buyers was still calm and there was still no intention to let go. Because the price of cotton was expensive and manufacturers could not make profits, the price of yarn could not fall too much. The yarn price is expected to rise because of the high price of silver and the expensive price of everything. Therefore, the idea of doing more is very deep for both retail and large customers. However, Ruida Company has been selling about 10,000 or more bales alone in recent days, and it is newly made. The market has not been affected by this huge amount of sales. It is said that the previous purchase of thousands of bales of 20-count futures from Japan is now cheaper than the three-grade American cotton yarns, so the hedge sales are accurate and there is still a surplus profit. The yarn market fundamentally needs real sales to be smooth and the market price to rise and have long-term strength. The price of spot yarn fell by 1.67 taels in the near term and 1.26 taels in the far term compared to the previous week. The total transaction statistics for the whole week were 85,700 bales. The spot yarn market was very sluggish and there was no excitement in all parties. According to the statistics of the purchases by various gangs throughout the week, the purchases by each gang totaled 4,990 bales. Among the peers, 1,550 bales were imported, the price fell by 1 tael and 3rd grade yarn fell by more than 10 yuan. The offerings from each factory were very fresh. The amount of bales purchased by each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Gang Bale Amount Gang Bale Amount Gang Bale Amount</p>
<p>Guangdong 25 Nanyang 185 Jiangxi 20</p>
<p>Hankou 1225 Qinhuangdao 115 Peers 1550</p>
<p>Ningbo 170 Tianjin 300 Changsha 120</p>
<p>Xuzhou 135 Wuhu 420 Miscellaneous Gang 300</p>
<p>Inland 700 Shantou 230 Sichuan 324</p>
<p>Niuzhuang 625</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Summary for the Past Week</h3>
<p>Description of the Process and Analysis of the Environment</p>
<p>The cotton market is strong because of the high price of gold and the low price of silver, the strange shrinkage of foreign exchange rates, the high and expensive value of foreign cotton, and the relatively cheap value of local cotton. Most people expect that Japanese merchants may launch export business in the future, so the market is frenzied and buyers are extremely enthusiastic. Buyers want to see prices above 40 taels. Before long, the silver price eased and foreign exchange rates slightly loosened. The Hankou gang took the opportunity to sell in large quantities and close out positions. Japanese merchants also sold, the market atmosphere was flat and people's hearts were slightly softened. However, American cotton fell sharply by 1.4 cents and the front line was broken. Retail buyers saw that the situation was not good and also stood by and did nothing. Therefore, the market has fallen. The price of standard cotton futures for each month fell by 67 cents compared to the previous week. The total transaction statistics for the whole week were 214,500 dan. The source of supply on the wharf was 7,060 bales of Yao flower and 3,300 bales of Tong flower. Each manufacturer imported 8,336 dan and the firm imported 4,650 dan. American cotton price fell by more than 170 pounds compared to the previous week. In the cotton market, most people believe that the exchange market cannot rise greatly and the future of cotton prices still has to rise. Although the falling trend of American cotton is fierce, the current impact of the exchange rate relationship is very small. The Hankou gang, which used to be the most aggressive on the long side, has already turned short for more than 20,000 dan. Japanese merchants' intention to import is also weak, so the cotton market situation is extremely complex and difficult to predict. The following is a list of the amount of bales and prices purchased by each manufacturer and firm:</p>
<p>Manufacturer Import Highest Price Lowest Price Transaction Volume Term Limit</p>
<p>Tijian Flower 37.00 500 bales Spot Delivery to Wuxi</p>
<p>Again 37.00 500 bales Again Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>American Seed Flower 46.50 120 bales Again Again</p>
<p>Shaanxi Flower 39.00 37.85 1600 pieces Again Again</p>
<p>Fire Machine Flower 56.50 500 bales Again Delivery to Wuxi</p>
<p>Firm</p>
<p>Fire Machine Flower 56.50 400 bales Spot Delivery at Wharf</p>
<p>Xia Sha Flower 36.00 31.00 1100 bales Again Again</p>
<p>Yao Flower 54.60 33.60 2100 bales Again Again</p>
<p>Jiujiang Flower 34.00 100 bales Again Again</p>
<h3>American Cotton Plummets 50 Pounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton fell due to good harvests, low consumption, and mass sales. Futures fell 30 to 55 pounds and spot fell 55 pounds. British cotton stopped trading and the Indian cotton market was bleak with little trading. The prices of Pingguo'er, Aomu La, and Bairoxi near and far terms were unchanged. The original telegram is recorded on the left (14th telegram):</p>
<p>American Cotton Compared to the Previous Day Compared to Shen Gui Indian Cotton Compared to the Previous Day Compared to Shen Gui</p>
<p>7 1385 Fell 55 5020 Flat Pingguo'er 175 Flat 29.10</p>
<p>10 1339 30 48.40 Aomu La 197 31.80</p>
<p>12 1355 33 48.80 Bairoxi 240 39.90</p>
<p>1 1350 32 48.60</p>
<p>Spot 595 55 50.50</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market Gradually Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of supply in Zhabei was insufficient in all directions. The market sales were active. The Changbang North Japonica rice still opened at 22 yuan, and the secondary price increased. The trend is to rise and not to fall. According to the market price of Japonica rice in Xibang, the price of brown rice is 16.2 yuan. According to Shen, the price of Japonica rice must be 23 yuan. In addition, at this time of breaking the grinder, the cost must be increased due to the rising relationship. Therefore, the market price of North Japonica rice is very difficult to fall. Therefore, the Japonica rice market will definitely be fixed or up in half a month. The sales of Bo Tao Workshop are very good. The shortage of daily goods affects the price and is unusually refreshing. High-quality goods have a great chance of breaking through the 21 yuan mark. Yesterday, the market saw a rise. The situation of Xian rice is still without a definite price due to the exhaustion of storage. The entire market only had foreign rice transactions, which were still not weak. The variable yuan sales also had a total of only 1,000 stones. The top goods were priced at 18.4 yuan, and the increase was calculated.</p>
<p>The arrival of Huhai rice in Hunan River is very rare. The buying mood in this street is not consistent. The Changxi North Japonica rice is very popular, but this goods is very limited. Therefore, the accumulation of Bo in this area is unprecedented in the past. Therefore, although the transaction volume is small, the high-quality goods are increasing at each section. The secondary market is also following up. The villages in Su and Tongji are also manned by merchants, who see the dwindling source of supply and raise the sales price along with the market price in all directions. The early rice and early rice in Nanbang are arriving in small quantities. The market is tight. The high-quality Bo here must be around 20 yuan. The general change is stable and the source of supply is slightly higher, opening at 18 yuan. The shady change is particularly good, because all roads are short of goods. Therefore, the stock in this port is very small. Buyers are paying special attention. If the particularly high-quality goods are priced at 17.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware Nails Sell Smoothly and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>The arrival of fresh nails is in great demand and the market is optimistic. Although the sales volume has been increasing for several days, the total transaction volume has still reached more than 100 barrels. Customers from the Yangtze River ports and the mainland are continuously purchasing the goods. The price is as high as 13.5 taels (3 points) per barrel, 11.5 taels (4 points), and 12 taels (5 points). The 6 points are more stagnant, estimated at 9 taels. It is found that the price of this product was extremely tired due to the arrival of Japanese products in the past. Recently, the East Exchange rate has risen sharply and the cost has increased sharply (the price per barrel must rise by 10 taels). Therefore, those in the same industry who have no purchase orders think that the future of the incoming market is more bright.</p>

<p>The Eighth Anniversary of the Premier's Martyrdom in Guangzhou</p>
<h3>The Necessary Understanding</h3>
<p>(1) In the summer of the eleventh year of the Republic (1922), the Premier moved his troops from Guangxi to the Northern Expedition, stopping at Guilin. Chen Jiongming, a rebellious element, feared that the success of the revolution would be detrimental to his personal ambitions. Therefore, he colluded with the Northern warlords to do everything possible to obstruct and sabotage the Premier's return to Guangdong to take command in Guangzhou. Chen Jiongming eventually launched a rebellion, which led to the Premier's hardship in Guangzhou for more than fifty days.</p>
<p>(2) After discovering that Chen Jiongming's troops were approaching the Presidential Palace, the Premier was unwilling to lightly abandon his post, intending to die for his country. Even when surrounded by rebellious troops, he still disregarded life and death, calmly boarded the ship on foot, commanded the soldiers, and personally braved the arrows and bullets to plan the suppression of the rebellion. This kind of great fearless spirit of revolution is indeed a model for comrades and compatriots to strive for.</p>
<p>(3) After this incident, the compatriots across the country admired the Premier's greatness even more, deeply believed that the Premier's doctrines and strategies were the precious raft for saving the people and the country, and all inclined towards revolution and supported the Party. The Party comrades each bravely strived to promote the revolution, so they were eventually able to eliminate the rebels and unify the country. All of this was due to the inspiration of the Premier's spirit during his hardship.</p>
<p>(4) Commemorating the Premier's hardship in Guangzhou, we know even more that false revolutionaries will eventually turn into counter-revolutionaries, and counter-revolutionaries will eventually be annihilated by revolutionary forces. Compared to the failures of Chen Jiongming, Yang Ximin, Liu Zhenhuan, and other rebels in the past, as well as the downfall of the Guangxi clique, Zhang Fakui, Tang Shengzhi, and other warlords in recent years, the events are clear and consistent. The rebellion of Kai Feng and others this time is similar to that of Chen Jiongming and the Guangxi clique, following the same pattern. After being attacked by our central army, they immediately collapsed and disintegrated, unable to escape the previous example of destruction. From this, it can be seen that revolutionary force is invincible.</p>
<p>(5) Commemorating the Premier's hardship in Guangzhou, we should arouse the Premier's spirit of perseverance and clean up all the reactionary remnants, and we should all sincerely support the central government and support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, a loyal believer, hard-working and meritorious, and a revolutionary leader. Only by consolidating a strong central government can we promote constitutional government, eliminate rebellion forever, prevent internal strife, and resist foreign aggression.</p>
<p>A Message to the People: Everyone knows that the purpose of the National Revolution is to seek freedom and equality for China. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to eliminate all obstacles to the revolution. In other words, it is nothing more than the struggle between revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries. The Premier devoted himself to the National Revolution for forty years, and the process was a glorious history of fighting against counter-revolutionaries. Conversely, the historical background of the Premier was that he was subjected to various attacks and traps by all counter-revolutionaries. Today, eight years ago, was the day when the Premier was attacked by the counter-revolutionary Chen Jiongming in Guangzhou, which was also the most glorious and heart-stirring page in the Premier's revolutionary history. In the summer of the eleventh year of the Republic, when the Premier was training his troops in Guilin and launching a long drive to the Northern Expedition, Chen Jiongming had already harbored ill intentions. When the Premier returned to attack Jiangxi, Chen Jiongming's rebellion became even more obvious. On June 16th, Chen Jiongming dared to lead the rebellious troops to surround the Presidential Palace, bombard Guanyin Mountain, and burn all the Three Principles of the People and other revolutionary writings that the Premier had worked on for decades. His intention was to capture the Premier and be satisfied. Fortunately, comrades such as Chiang Kai-shek of our Party protected him and risked their lives to escape the disaster. We should know that Chen Jiongming was indeed an ungrateful, destructive, and heartless traitor. Even if he was executed, he would deserve to die. Looking around the country now, we don't know how many traitors are like Chen Jiongming. For example, the current remnants of the Northern warlords such as Yan Xishan, Feng Yuxiang, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Fakui, and others who are advocating rebellion and mutiny are the same as the situation years ago, following the same path and arriving at the same destination. Therefore, today we must recognize these rebellious counter-revolutionary warlords. We must never compromise with them. If we do not fundamentally eliminate these rebellious remnant warlords, the National Revolution will never succeed. Therefore, we must seize the opportunity to continue the Premier's fearless revolutionary spirit, work together under the leadership of the central government to put down all rebellions, and then our commemoration today will be meaningful and valuable. Revolutionary people, work hard! Our slogans are to support Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, quell all rebellions, implement the Three Principles of the People, and complete the National Revolution.</p>
<p>A Message to Comrades: Comrades, you should remember that today is the eighth anniversary of our Premier's hardship in Guangzhou, a tragic day for Chen Jiongming's rebellion against the Party and his harming the country. At the same time, it is also the day when the traitors dug their own graves and realized their own destruction. History tells us that whoever betrays the Party betrays the demands of the people of the whole country. The result must be self-destruction. We see that in the eleventh year of the Republic, Chen Jiongming became the Minister of Military and Political Affairs, holding all the power, possessing an army of 100,000, and being rampant in Guangdong. The situation of surrounding the Presidential Palace and bombarding Guanyin Mountain was indeed very serious. However, the result was that Chen Jiongming only hastened his own destruction. Revolution is originally an extraordinary undertaking. In the process of revolution, there will inevitably be many difficulties and hardships. We should not lament or be discouraged. The Premier engaged in revolution for forty years, painstakingly and repeatedly failing more than ten times. However, these more than ten failures were all struggles against the revolutionary objects, imperialism, and the corrupt Qing government. This time, the unfortunate incident happened because Chen Jiongming, a party member who had followed the Premier for more than ten years, betrayed the Party. This is really heartbreaking. However, Chen Jiongming's daring to disregard everything and openly betray the Party was not accidental. The fundamental reason was the lack of Party training, because Chen Jiongming did not have a deep understanding of the Premier's personality, nor did he have a thorough understanding of the Premier's doctrines. He followed the Premier not to fight for the doctrines, nor to save China. He was just like a group of heroes from the past who wanted to attach themselves to the phoenix and follow the dragon to achieve his ambition of secession and his foolish dream of becoming the emperor of Guangdong. If Chen Jiongming had a solid understanding of the Premier's personality and a thorough understanding of the Premier's doctrines, then he would definitely not be willing to commit this crime of betraying the Party and harming the country. Therefore, we feel that without the Party's strict organization, the Party's practical training, the dangers within the Party may occur at any time. After the Premier's death, Chen Jiongming's second, Tang Shengzhi, as well as the Guangxi clique Bai Chongxi, Li Zongren, and others also rebelled one after another. Now Yan Xishan, Feng Yuxiang, and others are also openly rebelling against the central government, causing the entire Party to suffer, and at the same time, the people of the Northwest are also suffering greatly. There are so many rebellious elements within the Party, which makes it impossible to end the military affairs and relieve the suffering of the people. This responsibility naturally falls on all our comrades. If we want to complete the great cause of revolution as soon as possible, we must not have such rebellious elements within the Party so that constitutional government can proceed smoothly. Then how should we take responsibility to jointly eliminate all the enemies of the Party and at the same time pay attention to the Party's training work so that there will be no more rebellious elements within the Party. We painfully remember the past and witness the current environment of the Party is so bad, imperialism is staring and eagerly hoping that the Party will die and the revolution will be interrupted, the old and new warlords and bureaucratic politicians are burning incense and praying that the Party will be eliminated and the revolution will fail, the speculators and false revolutionaries only want to use the Party's brand to develop their individualism and expand their feudal forces. In this bad environment, we should truly unite and work together to quickly eliminate the rebellious Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang to protect the Party and save China. Comrades, everyone has a responsibility. Let's all work hard. Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Kuomintang</p>

<h3>Jointly Strive to Recover the Concession Telephone Service</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Business Reorganization Committee yesterday sent a letter to the Ministry of Communications, stating that on the 2nd of this month, a letter from the Ministry stated that it had heard that the Shanghai Concession authorities were considering changing the contractor due to the poor performance of the Concession telephone service. According to reports, the solicitation of bids from merchants was continuing. The Ministry could not remain silent and had consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to seriously negotiate and specifically requested that a letter of reasoning be jointly inspected to appeal for concerted efforts to recover the Concession telephone service. On the 7th of this month, the 53rd executive meeting of the association was held to discuss the issue. It was unanimously agreed that recovering the Concession was a consistent policy of the current government, and various public utilities in the Concession were closely related to the vital interests of the majority of citizens. Recently, issues such as the Shanghai Municipal Council Electricity Department and the China and Foreign Telephone Company regarding the sale have not respected the opinions of the majority of Chinese in the Concession, and the previous organization has been changed into a large-scale international investment. To the end of its drawbacks, this kind of private enterprise only seeks to increase profits, not only harming the public welfare of the citizens but also establishing a strong foundation for foreign capitalists, which is tantamount to secretly adding a reef to the future recovery of the Concession. It was decided that we should urgently agree with the Ministry's policy of recovering and operating on our own and cooperate to strive for it at any time. It is in the public interest to record the case and send a telegram to the Ministry for review and filing. Sincerely, The Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce and Trade Reorganization Committee</p>
<h3>French Minister Weili De Arrives in Shanghai on Schedule</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Daily reported that the newly appointed French Minister to China, Weili De, will arrive on the Zhenlangsha steamer on Friday. It is expected that he will stay in Shanghai for four or five days, allowing the people of Shanghai to have the opportunity to welcome him and talk about the old days. Minister Wei has served as the Consul-General in Shanghai for many years and has a close relationship with the local people. Friends in this port have already telegraphed to discuss holding a banquet to welcome him on Monday, the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Returned to Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting returned to the capital by night train last night. It is heard that Wang had previously protested against the sale of the Electricity Department but did not protest to the end. This time, he has been actively working on the recovery of the Concession telephone service.</p>
<h3>Mayor Zhang's Conversation with Director Dai</h3>
<p>Opinions on Personnel and Administration</p>
<p>Dai Jingchen, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau of Wuhan Special City, was ordered to investigate social conditions at home and abroad and arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. It is heard that Mr. Dai visited Mayor Zhang Yuejun of the Municipal Government in Fenglin Bridge yesterday and had a long conversation. It is heard that Mayor Zhang expressed many opinions on the appointment of civil servants and administrative policies in various agencies, roughly stating that before employing people, we should strictly investigate them. After appointing them, we must set a corresponding probationary period. After the probationary period expires, we will formally appoint them and give them definite guarantees. Therefore, the personnel of the Shanghai Municipal Government are not easily changed, and the municipal administration is progressing day by day and has a systematic approach. I, myself, take charge of the overall planning of the Shanghai municipal administration, both internally and externally, and the affairs of each bureau and department are still the responsibility of the heads of each bureau and department, and I do not interfere with my own intentions so that they can succeed. Mr. Dai also expressed his extreme agreement and said that this is not only a characteristic that municipal officials should emulate, but also that the central government and the provincial and municipal governments should also do the same in employing people and administering affairs, so that everyone can make the most of their talents and things can be planned according to their costs. I have worked in the Party, government, and military for more than ten years and have studied the laws and regulations of various countries, and I feel that this is not enough to correct the accumulated habits of our country. After the conversation, he also accompanied Secretary-General Yu Hongjun and others to visit the Counselor's Office and various departments and presented publications such as the statistical charts and regulations of the Municipal Government.</p>

<h3>The Case of Mutual Beating Between Water and Land Police Was Tried Yesterday</h3>
<p>All Police Chiefs Resume Their Posts Today</p>
<p>The case of mutual beating between water and land police in Minhang Town, the first district of Shanghai County, and the demolition of the first Anmin Company and the assault of many police chiefs, which led to a strike, has been reported in detail in yesterday's newspaper. It is learned that when the incident occurred that evening, the water police chief Chen and the public security bureau chief Pan were not in Minhang, which led to misunderstandings. Yesterday, after hearing the news, Chief Chen and Shen Jinghua, the chief of the county public security bureau, both came to Minhang to investigate and severely punished the perpetrators. Chen and Shen personally went to the first district office to gather the responsible personnel of the Party headquarters and the chamber of commerce to express their deep apologies to the people for the police panic they had suffered and promised to ensure that no more untoward actions would occur in the future. As for how the two sides would resolve the issue, Chen and Shen would handle it directly. It has been decided that all police chiefs will resume their posts from today.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Business Reorganization Committee</p>
<h3>Letter Urging Importers and Exporters to Settle Prices at Any Time</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Business Reorganization Committee yesterday sent a letter to the Huashang Cigarette Factory, Dongzhuang Foreign Goods, Hardware, New Medicine, Iron Industry, Cotton Cloth, Seafood, Grocery Industry, and other trade associations related to import and export, stating: "We are writing to inform you that the committee has discussed the impact of the skyrocketing gold prices on commerce and has formulated four remedial measures that have been published in the newspaper and separately submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and sent to relevant Chinese and foreign merchants for adoption and implementation. It has been found that the foreign goods industry is currently suffering from the rise in gold prices because it did not settle prices when concluding the order contract, which has led to the originally estimated cost of the goods at the time of the order being insufficient until now, or even exceeding the original amount by several times. If the goods cannot be shipped to Shanghai in the future, they will be sued by foreign merchants. If the goods are shipped, the sales of the guest merchants will be hindered and the goods will be difficult to sell. Shipping goods by collecting money is limited by capital and difficult to resolve. During the Republic of China's 10th year, the Shanghai market of cloth and wool had already experienced this panic once. At that time, some of those who settled prices in advance did not suffer this unexpected loss. As the saying goes, 'Don't forget the past, learn from it in the future.' The committee also knows that merchants engaged in import and export, the fixed quantity of their orders, and the example of their prepared capital are very different, so most of them are unwilling to settle prices at the time of ordering, which makes it difficult to turn over operating funds. However, in view of the danger of rising and falling gold and silver, weighing the pros and cons, they are willing to gradually think about changing plans in order to tend to be stable. Even for the sake of funds, ordering can be settled in advance, and the price can be paid after the goods arrive, which can be done in parallel without discussing settlement and payment together, which will lead to the danger of rising and falling gold and silver every day. In addition to sending letters to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to ask them to persuade foreign merchants in China to agree to this proposal, we specially send a letter to you, hoping that you will persuade your counterparts to follow the instructions.</p>
<p>Director Wu of the Shanghai Construction Bureau Talks</p>
<h3>An Overview of Dredging the Sanlin Pond</h3>
<p>The Sanlin Pond Port in Pudong is becoming increasingly silted up. The County Construction Bureau has consulted with the Fourth District to plan dredging and has established a preparatory committee</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>To carry out the work. Yesterday, Director Wu Wenhua of the bureau talked about the overview of dredging the Sanlin Pond in detail. According to him, Sanlin Pond, also known as Sanlin Port, is located in the northeast of the county, southwest of Kang Pang's residence, and joins the Pudong tide flowing east. The south bank belongs to Nanhui County, and the tributaries that come to join it include Xiaohuangpu, Xijingzi Port, Huangtubang, Yujingjing, and Xinqiao Port. The north bank belongs to the county territory. The largest of the tributary rivers is Xiaohuangpu Xinjing Port, which passes through Xisanlin Pond Town to Tianzhang Bridge and rejoins Yangzilin. Slightly east, it meets Xinqiao Port, and both the north and south banks enter the county territory. Further northeast, Tongtang Port, Xizhongfenjing, and Huangzilin rivers come to join it. On the south bank, the Zhutang, Changbang, and Baiqu ports come to join it. Then, east through Dongsanlin Pond Town, it meets the Dongzhongfenjing from the north to Qinglong Bridge, turns south, passes through Chencun Port and enters Nanhui County, and then merges with the Chencun Xiaoyaojing Xiantang waters to form Sanlinpu to reach Chuansha County. The entire river runs across three counties, and irrigation and transportation are extremely important. The irrigated land reaches more than 700 mu. It is not only the east-west main river in the county but also a major artery for the common prosperity of the three counties of Shangnan and Chuan. However, Sanlin itself and other larger tributaries absorb the rushing tide of Pudong, carrying sand and injecting sediment, and the accumulation of sediment is gradually increasing. If we do not dredge frequently, drought and flood will be seen every day. Since the great dredging of Sanlin in the 7th year of Jiaqing in the Qing Dynasty, there have been other dredging projects in the 13th year of Daoguang, the 7th year of Xianfeng, and the 21st year of Guangxu. At the same time, in the 21st year of Guangxu, the Chencun Port Yangzilin and other tributary rivers were dredged, and a total of more than 62,000 cubic feet of earthwork was excavated. For a time, the rivers were smooth and 10,000 boats were traveling, which was convenient for the residents. After the Republic of China, it has not been repaired for a long time, and it has gradually become silted up. In the 7th year of the Republic of China, the local people proposed to repair it and organized a mu donation and a commercial donation to raise funds. At that time, the labor cost was relatively low, but it also cost silver to 20,000 yuan. It has been more than ten years since the 7th year of the Republic of China, and due to the accumulation of the Pudong tide over the years, the siltation has been increasing day by day. Not only is it inconvenient for boats to travel, but also the amount of water in irrigation is insufficient. If it is not re-dredged and repaired, it will not work. The bureau, together with local people, convened a first preparatory meeting for dredging the Sanlin Pond in the Fourth Public Office of Sanlin Pond Town in Pudong on June 1, 19th year of the Republic, and decided: (1) The dredging area will still follow the old case, from Huangpu in the west to Chencun Port Guanyintang Nanhui County boundary in the east, and at the same time cover Xiaoxiaohuangpu and dredge Xinjing Port. (2) The dredging funds will be raised by collecting land taxes. Please refer to the established case and submit it to the county government to be forwarded to the construction and financial departments for review and approval. The association will also jointly raise funds from various stores with the Chamber of Commerce and the People's Association. (3) The dredging method will be handled by hiring workers. At that time, 25 preparatory committee members were elected to be responsible for carrying out the work, and it was decided that on June 21, the bureau and local people would conduct an on-site survey to estimate the project and then implement the survey and plan. The situation of siltation and the size of the project will not be difficult to estimate after the re-survey. However, the depth of dredging is different in each section, and it is difficult to statistically count the earthwork to be excavated. Moreover, the current price of materials and labor is several times higher than in the 7th year of the Republic of China, that is, the amount of funds cannot be compared with the 7th year of the Republic of China. Therefore, a detailed budget must be prepared accurately after the actual measurement. As for the section method and the dredging regulations, the 7th year of the Republic of China is quite detailed, so there is no need to re-draft it. It will be discussed after the on-site measurement.</p>
<p>Shanghai Factories Participate</p>
<h3>Qingdao National Exhibition Preparatory Committee</h3>
<p>Representatives Going to Qingdao to Set Off on Schedule</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal People's National Products Promotion Association believes that the Qingdao National Exhibition will be held soon, and everything should be done as soon as possible. The Qingdao side urged to send two representatives to Qingdao to publicize and organize the office in advance. On the afternoon of the 12th of this month, at 3 o'clock, the preparatory committee for the Qingdao National Exhibition was convened to discuss everything. It was decided to elect Xu Genghua and Zhu Boyuan to take the wheel to set off on the 21st of this month. It is heard that the internal organization of the association this time is very meticulous, especially the publicity work is more strengthened, so the participation of each factory is extremely enthusiastic. It is estimated that more than 30 factories have registered, including China Enamel Factory, Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory, Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Dazhong Towel Factory, Shengde Weaving Factory, Dasheng Weaving Factory, Fuzhou Yao Chuanhong Art Lacquer Factory, Zhenhua Pottery Factory, Yuan Zhenhe Silk Factory, Yunhua Silk Factory, Dacheng Weaving Factory, May 30th National Products Society, Songhexuan, China Brothers Industrial Society, Senyuanxiang Pearl and Diamond Factory, Changxing Cigarette Factory, etc.</p>
<h3>Please Release the National Goods Detained for the Shaoxing Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation sent a telegram to the Shaoxing County Government, stating that the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company was invited by the Hangzhou National Goods Factory Federation to participate in the exhibition in Shaoxing. The goods shipped to Shaoxing for the first time were detained by the Cloth Bureau, and Ruan Jihou guaranteed that he would submit a tax-free certificate for inspection within ten days before they could be released. The goods shipped to Shaoxing for the second time were detained and have not been returned. It has been found that for previous exhibitions, the organizing committee submitted a request for tax exemption. This time, the Shaoxing County National Goods Promotion Committee did not request the government to report it, which was indeed a mistake. The Ministry of Finance has instructed to delay the matter, causing this deadlock. In addition to the fact that the goods shipped to Shaoxing for the second time were detained and not participated in the exhibition, our association intends to persuade the company to painfully pay the tax and sell them separately. The goods shipped to Shaoxing for the first time should not be taxed. Why not follow the instructions of the Ministry of Finance? Since the matter has come to this point, we should remedy it. If your government can detail the previous mistakes to the Ministry of Finance and ask for tax exemption, it will be more convenient. If it is still not allowed, please submit a request to the provincial government to transfer it to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for a tax-free certificate, which will be more complete. Otherwise, if we delay it for a long time, who will be responsible? We specially sent a telegram to you, please check and hope to see a reply.</p>
<h3>Swedish Merchants Invade the Match Industry</h3>
<p>The Pudong Rongchang Match Industry Union issued a declaration to resist the Swedish merchants' invasion of our country's match industry: "Compatriots and workers all over the country, the economic forces of imperialism have spread all over East Asia, and their methods are becoming more and more spicy every year. They see that our country's industry has no hope of revitalization, and our Chinese people's patriotism is not as enthusiastic as that of other countries, so they think that our China can be deceived, insulted, and looted. Their plan is to completely eliminate our country's industry and completely bankrupt our country's economy before they are willing to let go. Sweden is one of them. Sweden's match industry is the most severe and ambitious of foreign goods invading China. From the 14th year of the Republic of China to the 16th year, according to the customs records, his annual elimination amount has increased from five times to seven times, which is enough to be alarming. In all the major trading ports and counties and towns of our country, the cigarette paper numbers can see the windmill, rose tree, temple, Dafeng Caishen, Feixi, Honghaier, Phoenix, and other brands produced by the Swedish merchant Min Guang Company and Ruizhong Foreign Company, which shows that the power of Swedish match invasion has spread all over the country. He deliberately sacrifices the cost to sell at a low price, first eliminating our country's match industry, and then using his aggressive means to monopolize to implement his plan to take first and give. Now he is buying the Suisheng Match Factory, which is operated by Japanese near Zhoujiaqiao near Xiaoshadu, setting up machinery, and is scheduled to start the factory on August 1st. Oh, dear compatriots, workers, if we don't rise up to resist, the domestic match industry will be crushed and may not exist. Tens of millions of match workers in our country will be the first to bear the brunt and lose their jobs. When we say this, our righteous indignation rises sharply, and our blood rushes suddenly. His conspiracy must be exposed, and his poisonous plan must be broken, so that his strategy is useless. The huge capital that he has lost can only withdraw his troops, be wounded and return, and dare not go beyond the thunder pool again. Oh, dear compatriots, workers, we are in the same boat. If the match industry falls, he will turn his attention to any Chinese industry that can be infringed, want to infringe, can be seized, want to seize. Imperialism's methods, which are more powerful than guns, are now being arranged and will eventually be practiced one by one. I sincerely hope that compatriots from all walks of life will unite and resolve to protect themselves and help us resist Swedish merchants' setting up factories in the mainland in the name of Japanese imperialism, not buying foreign goods, and purchasing domestic goods to show the greatness of the national spirit of the Republic of China and the enthusiasm of the Chinese people's patriotism."</p>
<h3>The Total Amount of Spring Cocoons from Zhejiang Province Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>This year, the Zhejiang Railway transported spring cocoons from various places in Zhejiang Province via the Huitong Transportation Company starting from the 12th of last month, and they were successively transported to Shanghai from various stations. By yesterday, a total of more than 93,200 cocoon packages had been unloaded from the South Station, and about 50,000 packages had been transported to the North Station. The total statistics reached more than 140,000 packages. According to the company, there are still about 12,000 to 3,000 packages stored at stations such as Zhakou and Changan to be transported. Yesterday, the company requested the Road Administration Bureau's vehicle department to load and transport the vehicles, which must be completed within a week. It is also heard that the summer cocoons in Haining and Changan will be weighed and purchased on the 22nd of this month. However, the summer cocoons in various places in Zhejiang this year seem to have a better harvest than in previous years. The estimated number of cocoons to be transported is 14,000 to 5,000 packages, while the number of transported cocoons in previous years was only 10,000 packages.</p>
<h3>The Situation of Summer Silkworms in Zhejiang</h3>
<p>The silk factories in this port believe that the spring cocoons in various counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have a poor harvest this year, and the raw materials are scarce. Statistics show that the cocoon production is only enough for the needs of April and May. The silk industry guilds in various places have promoted farmers to raise summer silkworms, and the silk merchants are very concerned about this year's summer silkworm season. Although the amount of summer silkworms raised in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year is not weak, the weather is not right and the silkworm season is not good, and most of them have been lost. The summer cocoons in Yuhang, Changan, Haining, and other early assistance areas in Zhejiang have already been put on the clusters, and the silk factories are sending personnel to purchase summer cocoons. The cocoon funds have also been remitted separately.</p>
<h3>Pharmacy Business Registration Rules</h3>
<p>Attention Pharmacy and Medical Device Merchants</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, in order to manage pharmacy businesses and prevent malpractices, intends to seriously handle the registration of pharmacy and medical device businesses.

<h3>Mayar Silk Weaving Factory Strike</h3>
<p>The Mayar Silk Weaving Factory went on strike this morning, putting forward four conditions: (1) Reinstate workers who were dismissed without cause; (2) Fulfill the conditions agreed upon by both parties in 1927; (3) Return savings deposits; (4) Abolish temporary employment contracts. They demand that the employer fulfill these conditions immediately. If the employer still refuses to accept, all workers in the factory vow not to return to work.</p>
<p>More than 2,000 workers at the Mayar Silk Weaving Factory at 830 Rue Massenet in the French Concession believe that the employer's proposal to abolish bonus pay and various other conditions is a deliberate attempt to oppress them. After repeated unsuccessful negotiations through representatives, the workers held a general meeting yesterday afternoon and resolved to go on strike today. This morning at 7:00 AM, they petitioned the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting public arbitration to resolve the matter.</p>

Although he was rescued at the time, he eventually died in May of this year due to a recurrence of the old wound, which was in a vital area, and was incurable. (Brief Biography of Martyr Fan) Martyr Fan is the younger brother of Fan Zhengbo, the current member of the Municipal Executive Committee. He served in the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Public Security Bureau.

<p>Ministry Order on Postal Service</p>
<h3>Patrol Officers to Watch Out for Smuggling of Contraband</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has repeatedly ordered the Postal Administration to strictly investigate the smuggling of prohibited drugs through the mail. Now, according to the Postal Administration's reports No. 271 and No. 272, one case involved red pills and the other involved opium, both of which are prohibited drugs smuggled through the mail. Such cases have been frequently reported in recent months, which is a serious matter. If such cases occur again in the future, severe measures must be taken to deter others. In addition, in the previous major opium smuggling case in the Liaoning district, it was only discovered by a special commissioner sent by the Postal Administration. The district patrol officers, assistant patrol officers, and local patrol officers, who have the special responsibility for patrolling, failed to detect the incident in advance, which is a dereliction of duty. Therefore, the Postal Administration of this city is hereby ordered to instruct all districts to strictly order all patrol officers under their jurisdiction to earnestly perform their patrolling duties in the future. The district supervisors should also pay close attention to the reports of the patrol officers. If any cases of drug smuggling are discovered and not reported by the local patrol officers, the local patrol officers should also be investigated and punished for their failure to perform their duties. This order must be strictly followed.</p>

<p>Tragedy at the Power Company</p>
<p>Explosion at the Ferren Road Plant</p>
<p>Two Western Engineers Dead, Two Chinese Injured</p>
<p>Electricity and Trolley Service Suspended for Two Hours</p>
<p>A generator at the Shanghai Power Company's Ferren Road power plant exploded suddenly at a few minutes before 7:00 a.m. yesterday, killing British engineer Kern and Russian assistant engineer Whiteofsky, and injuring Chinese workers Liu Bingkun and Wu Mingchun. The plant was slightly damaged by the explosion. Electricity and trolley service in the Public Concession were suspended for two hours as a result. The Shanghai Power Company's power plant had two locations, one was the new Yangshupu plant and the other was the old Ferren Road plant. The new Yangshupu plant had an explosion four or five years ago. Now, the old Ferren Road plant unexpectedly had a tragic explosion. The Ferren Road power plant has three generators. One generator is fully operational from 12:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. every night. At 6:45 a.m. every morning, another generator is added to supply the trolley current. The remaining generator is kept in reserve and not used. Yesterday morning, an English engineer, Kern, along with Russian assistant engineer Whiteofsky and oiling Chinese workers Liu Bingkun and Wu Mingchun were working in the generator room. The Russian assistant engineer started the second generator on time. Unexpectedly, the oil tank on the machine suddenly exploded, and the room was filled with smoke and fire. The clothes of the English engineer and the Russian assistant engineer were also burned. The two immediately rushed out of the door, but both suffered from fire poisoning. The English engineer fell at the entrance, and the Russian assistant engineer intended to escape into the Suzhou River in front of the factory, but he also collapsed on the road. People in the factory learned of the incident and immediately reported it to the fire brigade. However, although the fire brigade arrived immediately, they could not shoot water into the machine room because they were afraid of causing further damage. They only scattered sand into it. At that time, the two English and Russian engineers had already fallen to the ground but had not completely lost their breath. They were rushed to the Country Hospital, but there was no way to save them and they died soon after. In addition, Liu Bingkun, the oiling worker in the machine room, suffered burns to his face and both hands. Wu Mingchun also suffered head injuries. They are now being treated at the Tongren Hospital and their injuries are expected to be fine. The machinery and buildings were also slightly damaged, but most of them were not affected. The electricity and trolley service in the Public Concession were suspended for two hours as a result. The factory authorities refused to clearly state the cause of the explosion. According to other sources, the deceased Russian assistant engineer had not been in the factory for long and lacked experience. It was said that he did not operate the machine properly yesterday morning, causing the accident. According to another source, the factory originally had an engineer who recently resigned for some reason, and hired a Russian as the assistant engineer. The Russian assistant engineer graduated from the University of London and had only been in the factory for a week. The factory authorities were afraid that he did not have enough experience and had the British engineer supervise him, but unexpectedly, the two died in the tragic accident yesterday.</p>
<h3>Dance Hall Manager Assaulted</h3>
<p>Hu Chichang Attacked in the Dark Alley</p>
<p>Unable to Resist Under Iron Rods</p>
<p>Hu Chichang, nickname "Young Master Jiangbei", the 25-year-old manager of the New World dance hall on Nanjing Road and Guizhou Road, residing at No. 271 Deren Lane, Guizhou Road. Hu has extensive experience in the dance hall business. At half past six in the evening, after dinner at home, he went to the New World dance hall as usual to work. Unexpectedly, as soon as he stepped out of his door, a person dressed in a blue cloth short shirt came up and grabbed Hu's chest. Hu, being somewhat physically strong, waved his hand to resist. Unexpectedly, two more people came from behind, grabbed Hu's feet, and pushed him forward, causing Hu to fall to the ground. Then, several accomplices were seen holding iron rods and fiercely hitting Young Master Jiangbei's arms. His legs were also hit by iron rods. Hu, in the dark alley, could not recognize the faces of the people and mustered his remaining strength to stand up, but his back was hit by several more iron rods. It was estimated that there were five or six rioters in total. At this critical moment, Hu shouted for help and blew his police whistle. At this time, passers-by and residents in the alley heard the sound and came out to see. The rioters, seeing that the situation was not good, abandoned their iron rods and fled. Hu's younger brother, Yuanchang, also worked at the New World dance hall. Knowing that his brother had been ambushed, he immediately reported it to the Laozha Police Station. The police chief, upon hearing the news, believed that the case involved rioters acting in a gang and immediately ordered detectives to arrest them. They were arrested at the Pacific Hotel along with two iron rods and immediately taken to the police station. At the same time, a Chinese man in a Western suit, carrying a Japanese woman, claimed that Hu had molested the Japanese woman last Saturday. The police immediately investigated the truth. The Chinese man's evidence was insufficient and there were suspicious points, so he was immediately dismissed. The police believe that the rioters' attack is of considerable research value. When asked by Hu Chichang, he said that the attack was instructed by someone else. According to reporters' investigation, it was heard that Young Master Jiangbei usually manages the New World dance hall strictly and is very strict with the dance girls. This time, he was beaten in the dark alley because some dance patrons resented his strict handling of affairs and his lack of consideration for friendship. Fortunately, his injuries are not serious and he is now recovering at home.</p>
<h3>Two Negotiation Items on Cross-Border Road Construction</h3>
<p>Foreigners Disregard Our Police Authority</p>
<p>The police authority on Dixwell Road, which was built by the Public Works Department across the border, originally belonged to our country. On the 21st of last month, the Japanese police of the Dixwell Road Police Station arrested a petty thief at No. 214 Dongyang Lane on the road and sent him to the Provisional Court, which fined him 20 yuan or detained him for 10 days. The Municipal Public Security Bureau learned of this and believed that the police station's arrest of people across the border was illegal. It sent a special letter to the police department of the Public Works Department to negotiate and maintain our country's police authority. In addition, in the area of the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Changchun Road, which belongs to the Chinese territory, there are several newly built foreign houses. The Public Security Bureau numbered them from No. 1105 to No. 1147. On the 14th of this month, the police of the 1st station of the 5th district of the Public Security Bureau went door-to-door to number the houses. Unexpectedly, they found that the Public Works Department had nailed 11 number plates on the doors of the houses. Director Zhao believed that the foreigners' unauthorized nailing of number plates across the border was detrimental to our country's sovereignty and reported the situation to his superiors to negotiate with the concession authorities.</p>
<p>After the Train Whizzed By</p>
<h3>Scavenging Woman's Body Separated from Her Head</h3>
<p>Flesh and Blood Flying, Too Horrible to Bear</p>
<p>At about 3:10 p.m. yesterday, a Shanghai-Nanjing train heading from the North Station to Nanjing passed near Mackinnon Road. A scavenging woman from Jiangbei, about 40 years old, dressed in torn and dirty clothes, was picking up coal cinders by the side of the track. Although she saw the train approaching, she thought the distance was still far away and continued to scavenge. Unexpectedly, in an instant, the train was already in front of her. She wanted to avoid it urgently, but it was too late. The wheels ran over her, and her body was separated from her head. Her left arm was also broken. Flesh and blood were flying everywhere, which was too horrible to bear. At that time, the deceased's son, about 11 or 12 years old, was picking up on another track. Seeing his mother being crushed to death by the train, he rushed forward and hugged her body, crying loudly. The railroad staff then joined the head and body and moved them to the side of the road and reported to headquarters for investigation.</p>
<h3>Suspect in the Zhang Ziyan Case</h3>
<p>Shen Went Missing After Zhang's Death</p>
<p>His Wife, Concubines, and Associates Detained</p>
<p>Zhang Ziyan, the accountant of the North China Coal Yard on Rihui Port, South Shanghai, was shot and killed at Xiaomuqiao Sanjiali at around 11 a.m. the day before yesterday, and a pistol and an account of over three hundred yuan were robbed. The bailiff reported the case, and the local court sent someone to examine and identify the body and await the arrest of the murderer. It is learned that Shen Youqi, a foreman on the wharf of the coal yard and a native of Suqian, used to open a "Tiger Stove" on the Dalaai Wharf. This person has always had some latent influence on the wharf. Therefore, when the North China Coal Yard opened a new wharf, Shen took people to seize it by force and make it his own. The coal yard had no choice but to hire him as the foreman. However, Zhang Ziyan was the company's accountant and also the executive of the 4th District Reorganization Committee of the Wharf Workers' Union, so Shen Youqi's position came into conflict. When Zhang Ziyan was killed, Shen was also missing. Therefore, the 2nd District Police Station and the company believed that Shen was highly suspected. However, because Shen was not present, a certain associate, Wang Deming, and his wife, Shen Ma's, and his concubine, Shen Liu's, were all detained for questioning. All claimed to be ignorant. They were immediately presented to the Public Security Bureau, who yesterday transferred them to the local court for interrogation by Prosecutor Yang. An order was given to detain them and arrest Shen Youqi for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Gambling Tools Hidden in Fountain Pens</h3>
<p>Order the Customs and Municipal Education Bureau to Ban Them</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education of the National Government recently received a report from the Rehe Education Bureau stating that a foreign fountain pen has recently appeared on the market. Its appearance is no different from ordinary fountain pens, but a gambling tool is hidden inside its barrel. General young students have weak knowledge and are most easily infected with the habit of gambling. It should be ordered to strictly prohibit them. In view of the strict prohibition of gambling, it is inconvenient to allow them to multiply. It should be strictly prohibited as a whole.

In addition to submitting a request to the Executive Yuan to order the Jianghai Customs to strictly prohibit imports, the Shanghai Special Municipal Education Bureau is also ordered to pay attention to and prohibit them.</p>
<h3>Tobacco and Exchange Merchants Request Association to Announce Price Increase</h3>
<p>The South District Office of the Tobacco and Exchange Industry Consolidation Committee of this city received letters from colleagues in various industries reporting that foreign tobacco has suddenly soared in price, and products such as kerosene, matches, and foreign soap have all increased several times. Chinese merchants' cigarettes such as Huacheng, Zhongnan, and Zhonghe have also increased sharply one after another. Moreover, the prices of all goods have risen sharply and the cost of living is high. If sold at the previously determined prices, it will be a loss of capital and it will be too difficult to maintain. They asked whether the South City could first consider adding to maintain costs. District Committee Member Zhang Songji and others immediately convened a meeting after receiving the letter and re-ordered a temporary price list to be printed in one thousand copies and attached a notice to the South City colleagues stating that the association is abolishing old customs and bad practices, collaborating for the welfare of the public, and preparing for merger and reorganization in accordance with the law. The election procedures are still ongoing and have not been completed. The consolidation of prices and promotion of domestic goods will naturally be carried out and will be handled after the establishment of the association. It is hoped that the entire group will work together to move forward consistently. Now it is reported that the price of each goods has increased repeatedly and requests to maintain the cost and benefit the whole group are appropriate. Prior approval was given by the General Office to allow for changes. The temporary prices are set as follows. Please observe them consistently. In the future, increases and decreases will be announced again. Please do not destroy or misunderstand.</p>
<h3>Hundred Jar of Wine Money to Free a Prostitute</h3>
<p>Unable to Make Up the Difference, Poisoning</p>
<p>The Suicide of Lin Jingming</p>
<p>Lin Jingming, a 20-year-old Cantonese, worked at the Xinfeng No. 9 Hotel in Guangdong. Last year, he was instructed by his employer to transport a hundred jars of wine to Shanghai for sale. He arrived in Shanghai on November 8. Lin sold the wine he brought to various restaurants, each jar worth 20 gold, about 2,000 yuan for a hundred jars. In less than three months, it was sold out. He was fond of pleasure and had an affair with Zhu Qiongzhen, a Cantonese prostitute in Renzhi Lane, North Sichuan Road. He used the money to redeem her freedom. Half a month ago, he took a steamer back to Guangdong with Zhu. After meeting his master, he could not produce the money, so he had to prevaricate and say that it had not been sold out. He stayed for less than a week and then used the excuse to bring his lover to Shanghai the day before yesterday and stayed at Zhu's foster mother's house in Renzhi Lane. In the evening, he drank several glasses of brandy and went to sleep behind closed doors. Until yesterday morning, there was no movement. The madam was very surprised and suspicious and opened the door to see Lin's complexion had changed greatly and was horribly fierce. She touched him and he was already breathless. She urgently reported to the police station and took a car to Tongren Hospital for examination. It was found that he had taken poison. The reason for his suicide must have been that he could not make up for the money.</p>

They have been married for two years and their relationship has always been harmonious. Since Youyi went out to work last year, there have only been the father-in-law and daughter-in-law at home. Qin is lively by nature and serves her father-in-law filial piety and is inseparable from him, so she is quite loved by her father-in-law. As a result, the relationship between the father-in-law and daughter-in-law is unusually intimate, and outsiders view it with criticism. This spring, his son Youyi stopped working and stayed at home. Seeing the close proximity of the father-in-law and daughter-in-law and hearing the ridicule of outsiders, he became suspicious and paid attention to it. If his wife's actions were even slightly inappropriate, he would scold her harshly. His father still helped his daughter-in-law to stop him. At about 12 p.m. the day before yesterday, Youyi, unable to bear it any longer, became extremely angry and beat his wife Qin. Unexpectedly, his father heard the sound and rushed forward, intending to protect his daughter-in-law and beat his son. Seeing this, Youyi became even more angry and abandoned his wife and twisted and beat his father. The shop assistant Xu Shoufa stepped forward to persuade him and was also beaten. Xu then called the police to come and arrest them together and return to the 6th District Police Station. After District Chief Ren interrogated them separately, he believed that the case was related to unfilial conduct and assault on his father, so he immediately prepared a document and transferred it to the court for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Older Sister Catches Younger Sister's Adultery</h3>
<p>Double Son-in-Law's Chamber Pot on His Head</p>
<p>Junior Wife is Angry and Mr. Deng is in Trouble</p>
<p>Dai Song, a 54-year-old woman from Yangzhou residing at No. 473 Haining Road, has four daughters, Longzhu, Fengzhu, Lizhu, and Mingzhu. Song allows her four daughters to choose their own marriage partners freely and does not interfere. Longzhu married Mr. Deng from Guangdong 13 years ago and has considerable wealth and has given birth to a son. Fengzhu married Mr. Lu from Zhenjiang last year and teaches in Shanghai. The two are vastly different in wealth. Deng sees that both aunts are extremely beautiful and wants to hunt them. Moreover, his sister-in-law's residence lacks companionship, so he tries to lure her in many ways and achieves his desire to "shoot two eagles with one arrow." Therefore, he rents a house in Tangjia Lane as a place for secret meetings and frequently sends money, clothes, and jewelry. For this reason, Song treats him even more favorably every time Deng arrives. Fengzhu lives adjacent to her but feels lonely and unhappy. Later, she sees that Deng's actions with her two younger sisters are secretive and intimate and that they go out together from time to time. She knows that something is wrong and secretly investigates the truth. She informs her older sister Longzhu and discusses a plan to catch the adulterer. The other day (Saturday), Deng came to stop and invited the whole family to watch a play. Song refused to go, and Deng took his two aunts out. Fengzhu saw that the opportunity had come and informed her older sister Longzhu and invited her younger sisters to wait near Tangjia Lane. Late at night, they saw Deng and his two aunts arrive in a car, holding hands and entering the door in a very pleasant manner. They hid outside the door and waited for a long time, expecting them to be asleep. They led the women to knock on the door. The maid hired by Deng, who pretended to be staying in Deng's house, was dumbfounded when she saw the hostess. Longzhu and others went straight upstairs and broke into the room and saw Deng and his two younger sisters putting on their clothes and getting out of bed. They could not help but become furious and put a chamber pot on Deng's head and ordered the sisters to destroy the furnishings in the room and ask their mother to come and testify. When they wanted to twist and go to the police station, Song arrived and the vinegarous wind subsided slightly. Deng saw Longzhu talking to her mother and took the opportunity to escape. It is now heard that Song believes that her two daughters were seduced by Deng and their reputations were ruined. Longzhu believes that her husband is like a beast and it is difficult to live with him, so they hired a lawyer and plan to resolve the matter legally with Deng.</p>

<p>Compensation Sought for Injuries, 100 Yuan</p>
<p>Mrs. Chen, a Chinese woman and wife of Russian Mr. Hilaukov, resided at No. 129 Avenue Joffre, opposite the main police station of the French Concession. On September 24th of last year, she went out on an errand. As she stepped out of her front door and walked towards the neighboring No. 127, she was suddenly attacked by a rabid dog kept by Russian Mr. Debalov who resided in the house and bitten severely on her arms, legs, and other areas. She was treated at the hospital. Subsequently, she hired lawyer Ai Zhenlin to represent her in a lawsuit against Mr. Debalov at the French Court, seeking compensation for damages. Judge Tang approved the case and summoned the defendant. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the plaintiff had spent 350 yuan in medical expenses due to the injuries and requested compensation. The defendant hired lawyer Zhang Aicang to defend him, stating that both parties operated foreign hotels. The defendant had previously reported to the police station that the dog was rabid, but the police refused to take action. As a result, the defendant had to tie the dog on the balcony. On the day in question, the rope was somehow bitten through by the dog, and it jumped off the balcony and bit the plaintiff. The defendant was very sorry at the time and immediately euthanized the dog and sent the plaintiff to the hospital for treatment. The incident was unexpected and unintentional. He requested the court to take these circumstances into consideration and ordered that the defendant compensate the plaintiff 100 yuan for damages, to be paid within fourteen days.</p>

<p>On the 12th of this month, a patrol officer from the Old Gate police station apprehended a bandit at the intersection of Tibet Road and Amoy Road.

<h3>Sea Swallow Captain Sued</h3>
<p>Sea Swallow Vessel Sinks a Barge</p>
<p>Lu Shuhua Pursues Justice for His Son</p>
<p>Lu Shuhua, a 60-year-old resident of Chuansha, had a 27-year-old son named Sanlang, who worked as a helmsman on Qiu A'bing's barge. On April 25th, Qiu's barge, fully loaded with wheat, was sailing to the Bund Customs Wharf at dusk. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Sea Swallow vessel was entering the harbor at high speed. Although Qiu's barge had lights, the Sea Swallow did not pay attention and crashed into Qiu's barge. Qiu's barge was immediately destroyed, and all the helmsmen fell into the water. Two smaller boats alongside Qiu's barge were also affected. A rescue operation was immediately launched, but Lu's son, Sanlang, had already perished in the water. After hearing the news, Lu came to Shanghai and negotiated with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company but failed to reach a satisfactory resolution. He hired a lawyer and sued the captain of the Sea Swallow vessel, Jiang Changqing, for negligence and failing to salvage the body, seeking punishment for causing death due to negligence. He also filed a civil lawsuit seeking compensation and a consolation fee totaling 5,000 yuan. Judge Sun of the Criminal Court of the Special District Court summoned the defendant Jiang Changqing to court for questioning. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that Qiu A'bing and others had also filed a lawsuit against the defendant. Judge Sun ordered that the case be adjourned and combined with Qiu's lawsuit for trial.</p>
<h3>Southern Goods Store Accountant Embezzles Public Funds</h3>
<p>Ma Jinfan from Kunshan, the accountant of Da Shun Gong Southern Goods Store at 1759 Xin Zha Road, embezzled 2,000 taels of silver over the past four years by privately carving seals and forging account books. The store owner, Lu Zhengxiang, discovered the embezzlement and filed a criminal lawsuit. The Special District Court conducted an initial hearing and ordered the defendant to post a 2,000 yuan bond. Judge Wu held a subsequent hearing yesterday afternoon. Lu Zhengxiang stated that due to years of losses, he intended to sell the business. In April, the defendant introduced a buyer, only then did he discover the fraud. The key witness, Zhang Shousong, had been taken away by Ma. He requested Zhang's sister to testify. The woman, Zhang Sibao, testified that her brother Shousong had been invited out by Ma on the twenty-fifth of last month and had not returned since. However, the defendant denied inviting Zhang out and denied any embezzlement. Judge Wu ordered further investigation and ordered the defendant to continue providing bail and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3>Fang Guanle Accused of Ignoring Mortgage</h3>
<p>Gan Yuesong, a Cantonese man with British citizenship and substantial wealth, recently sued Fang Guanle, a shareholder of Da Wen Sock Factory, in the Special District Court for ignoring the mortgage. Judge Xu Wenyong convened a court hearing. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the defendant had previously sold the factory's assets to Lu Junming due to business failure, using the proceeds as capital. On August 14th of the previous year, Lu mortgaged the factory located at 148 Tiantong'an Road to the plaintiff for 5,000 yuan. When the mortgage became overdue, Lu Junming passed away last year. Fang then took all the factory's records and ignored the debt. The lawyer requested the court to hear the case. Gan Yuesong explained the loan details, stating that the interest rate was set at two percent per month. Judge Xu said that a monthly interest rate of two percent was excessive and violated the law. Gan requested the court to make an appropriate decision and claimed that the insurance and the first installment of interest, totaling 700 yuan, had been deducted from the loan, so only 4,300 yuan had been given to Lu. The defendant Fang Guanle also hired a lawyer to defend him, stating that the mortgage was Lu's personal action and that Lu did not deposit the mortgaged funds into the factory. Therefore, the defendant should not be responsible for repayment. Subsequently, a third party, Tan Jingyun, hired lawyer Shen Yuesheng to join the lawsuit. Lawyer Shen stated that Fang Guanle had mortgaged the Da Wen factory land and all assets to Tan on July 19th of the previous year for 10,000 yuan. The agreement stipulated the dates and times. Gan's mortgage was later in time, so the mortgaged assets should belong to Tan. Tan had already sued Fang Guanle and Zhang Diyi in the Shanghai District Court for ignoring the mortgage and had won a judgment ordering Fang and Zhang to repay Tan 8,000 yuan in principal and 2% monthly interest, plus 500 yuan in legal fees. Tan is now seeking execution of the judgment because Fang and others have not complied with the order. Gan's lawyer heard this and stated that Gan had filed a lawsuit with the District Court to object to the execution. The matter would be resolved legally in the future. After the arguments were completed, Judge Xu adjourned the court for a later verdict.</p>

<p>Wired and Wireless</p>
<p>Method for Dividing Electricity Fees</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications stated that according to the Wireless Radio Administration, when wire and wireless transmissions are interchanged, such as a telegram from Nanjing to Wuzhou sent from the Nanjing station to the Shanghai station, which is then sent via wireless to the Guangdong station and forwarded to the Wuzhou station, the issue arises of how the telegraph fees should be distributed. After receiving the report, the Ministry determined that regulations should be established to ensure compliance. Hereafter, when fees are split between station changes, regardless of the number of stations, the division of electrical fees between wired and wireless transmission should be based on Item 3 of the mutual transmission method, where the sending station or platform and the initial receiving platform each receive half of the fee in order to expedite the procedure. The Wireless Radio Administration and Shanghai Telegraph Bureau are ordered to follow the regulation.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Having read the article in your newspaper's local news column on June 12th regarding the attempted reconciliation of the Huashen Temple lawsuit, many of the statements are inaccurate. I hereby present the following clarifications:</p>
<p>Lu Tuquan is the grandson of Lu Nianchun, who was hired by the Huashu Gongsuo (Flower and Tree Public Association) as a caretaker. Lu Nianchun, on the 20th day of the tenth month of the 25th year of the Guangxu reign (Qing Dynasty), invited a guarantor to establish an employment contract with the Huashu Gongsuo, agreeing to serve as a caretaker. After Nianchun's death, his son A Gui (i.e., Tuquan's father) continued as caretaker. Upon A Gui's death, his wife, Madam Xu, along with her sons Tuquan, Jingen, and Sanmao, jointly served as caretakers. This constitutes three generations of the Lu family serving as caretakers.</p>
<p>In the 18th year of the Republic of China, our association was legally reorganized from the Huashu Gongsuo into the Huashu Tongye Gonghui (Flower and Tree Trade Association), in accordance with the regulations issued by the National Government for organizing trade associations. This reorganization was duly registered, and a register was created and submitted for record. Subsequently, in an effort to eliminate corruption and strive for construction, under the guidance of the Party branch and the Social Affairs Bureau, committee members were elected to manage the association's affairs. In each meeting, members repeatedly raised concerns about the caretaker, the Lu family, violating the contract and committing various offenses:</p>
<p>(1) Allowing idlers to spend the night in front of the Huashen (Flower Deity) idol to seek gambling opportunities and profit from them, resulting in a child drowning in the pond, causing trouble. This is evidenced by a newspaper article dated July 20th of the 18th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(2) Unauthorized renting out of rooms and collecting cash, underreporting the amount received, and pocketing thirty yuan for personal use. This is evidenced by the investigator Gao Fengshan and the minutes of the meeting.</p>
<p>(3) Refusing to comply with the termination of employment and eviction from the association, and instead assaulting member Lu Mingzhao. This is evidenced by the official stamp and approval to send the caretaker to the Public Security Bureau for punishment.</p>
<p>(4) Losing a significant number of tools entrusted to the caretaker by the association, failing to make compensation. This is evidenced by the minutes of the meeting. Furthermore, the caretaker has neglected the main task of cultivating flowers and has abandoned the land rights. How can the removal of his position by the standing committee be considered a violation of rights?</p>
<p>The association's original five rooms and two side-rooms were built with donations from fellow traders during the Guangxu 17th year, before the Lu family became caretakers. This is documented in the donation book. Additionally, the five-story building was built with donations from fellow traders in the 8th year of the Republic of China, with the Lu family contributing not a single penny. This is also documented in the records. How can one readily believe Lu Tuquan's claim in court that the expansion of the temple into today's grand view was managed and operated by the Lu family, confusing the public?</p>
<p>Even if the Lu family had built eight flower sheds on the land in the past (the contract stipulated that no ponds or houses could be dug or built on the land), it was already a breach of contract. Removing them five years ago for the association's use was in compliance with the contract. Even if three sheds remain and genuinely belong to the caretaker, dismantling them upon termination of the contract would not warrant any compensation for losses, especially since there is currently nothing on the land. How can one demand compensation for losses?</p>
<p>Furthermore, our association was legally reorganized and took over the management from the Huashu Gongsuo in accordance with the regulations. How can this be called forceful seizure? Most absurdly, the caretaker contract stipulates that the remaining land is to be cultivated by the caretaker, with rent as compensation, and no salary is paid. How can there be a claim of thirteen months of unpaid salary? As for the flower pots and flower bowls worth two hundred yuan, these are tools for Lu to grow flowers for profit and cannot be forcefully purchased by the association.</p>
<p>In summary, Lu's statement is a stream of unfounded and baseless claims, a muddled account that has already been discerned by the judge. At that time, the judge earnestly advised the association's representative, Huang Yuejian, to seek reconciliation to avoid litigation. This was merely a well-intentioned attempt to resolve the matter peacefully. Now, the association has convened a meeting, and all members agree that Lu, a mere employee who has violated the contract, is now retaliating by falsely accusing the association in court, attempting to establish an association by force, compelling relocation, and fabricating facts to inflate the amount of losses, creating something out of nothing. If he is allowed to continue as caretaker, will he not eventually usurp the authority and seize the association's property as his own?</p>
<p>Therefore, not sparing any words, please make corrections to the facts.</p>

What makes Cantonese opera stand out is not only the singing and acting of the performers, but also the novelty of the stage scenery, which is necessary to attract audiences. The Guang Stage has hired the Huanyu Orchestra to perform in Shanghai. The orchestra has previously performed and gained the appreciation of audiences. This time, not only have the unseen stage settings been renovated, but the performers are also more renowned than before. Leading male actors such as Tang Boming, female lead Feng Jingwen, Xiao Yulin, young male actor Li Yulin, and comedian Chen Shaolin are all talented individuals in the Cantonese opera scene. Their arrival in Shanghai will surely be a feast for the eyes of the Shanghai people. Tonight is expected to be a grand occasion.</p>

<h3>Fudan Drama Society's Performance of "Cyrano de Bergerac"</h3>
<p>17th, 18th, and 19th</p>
<p>At the New Central Theater on Haining Road</p>
<p>The audience was astonished by the grand structure and meticulous performance of the drama, “Cyrano de Bergerac”, which Fudan Drama Society performed at Fudan University in Jiangwan on the evening of the 11th. Formal performances are now scheduled for the 17th, 18th and 19th at the New Central Theater. "Cyrano de Bergerac" is a romantic, poetic, and historical drama that caused a stir in the 19th century. In France, this drama is used as a textbook in schools, and its literary value is evident. Now, Mr. Hong Shen is guiding the Fudan Drama Society with great perseverance to stage this drama on the Chinese stage. There are more than 70 characters, and the costumes are specially made according to the French Louis era style. The performance strives for stylization, which differs from the realistic style, and may refresh the Shanghai audience.</p>
<p>Jinan Normal School and Junior High School</p>
<h3>Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>The exhibitions at Jinan University can be considered numerous, and are mostly about academic and technical skills. Often, at the end or beginning of the semester, the achievements are presented to teachers and students for appreciation.</p>
<p>Now, the two exhibitions of the Normal School and Junior High School of Jinan University have both opened, running from the 15th to the 17th. The internal paintings include watercolors, charcoal paintings, and other handicrafts, including copper, iron, plastic, wood, bamboo, and other items, which are very beautiful.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that the students of the Normal School and Junior High School of Jinan University will work hard to create an artistic university. (An)</p>
<h3>Dedicated to Female Students Who Love Theater</h3>
<p>The year 19 of the Republic of China is clearly a year of drama. (This year is indeed more prosperous than before.) The emergence of drama clubs can be said to be like bamboo shoots after rain, constantly continuing. Not to mention the organization of drama clubs in various universities, which are often seen in newspapers, even girls' schools in middle schools seem to be greatly influenced, and are busy acting or perhaps suffering from the infectious disease of drama. In the past six months, the dramas that have been performed include the Drama Association's "The Merchant of Venice," the Xinyou Drama Society's "Uncle Vanya," "The Dog's Dance," and "Peach Blossom Spring," as well as the Southern Country's "Carmen," which is currently being performed. It is also heard that the Fudan Drama Society will perform on the 17th of this month, and the Drama Association will perform on the 20th. As for the future, there are other possibilities that cannot be predicted. As for the performances of drama clubs in various universities, they are too numerous to list.</p>
<p>Art is the spirit that encourages national endeavor. In China, where national character is withering day by day, the power of art should be used as the pioneer of national movement. Young people should shoulder this responsibility.</p>
<p>Some more enlightened young people have worked hard to participate in the drama movement, and now they have achieved such results, which cannot but be attributed to them. In particular, it is very rare to see a group of young ladies stepping from the boudoir or classroom onto the stage of drama.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, some people engaged in the drama movement seem to have turned in another direction. Behind the plays of these people, there seem to be dark and sinister shadows. Long Zhao will not comment on them for the time being, but what must be said is that eight or nine out of ten female actors and female students who love drama are pure and innocent little angels. They have never experienced the social environment, all the darkness, sinisterity, cunning, and fraud. They only know art for art's sake and acting for the sake of acting. Before they act, they do not study or consider the intention of the script. They only obey meekly and will perform whatever they are told. They will shout whatever they are told to shout. The only complaint is the dispute over the leading role. After the more outstanding and beautiful ladies obtain the leading role, they have nothing to say. (This is not an insult to women, it is a fact that shows us.) It is a pity that they are so bewitched by the hypnotic drug and surrounded by shadows.</p>
<p>Ladies, please consider and examine yourselves before joining the performance. This is the most important thing. An observer cannot but speak out. (Mei)</p>
<h3>The Development of Sports at Jinan University</h3>
<p>Now, who in China and abroad does not know about the National Jinan University in the western suburbs of Shanghai? And what kind of glory does it have in sports? We can see it with our own eyes. It is a top-notch national university. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it has progressed with the progress of the trend. The development of science, construction, and sports are all particularly advanced. To be honest, it is more advanced than other universities. The western-style houses in the science and construction area can prove this. In terms of sports, the special style also shows the efforts of Jinan University.</p>
<p>Recently, the joint sports meeting of teachers and students of the College of Education ended from the beginning of May to the end. The football, basketball, volleyball, tennis, track and field events, and the track and field and recreational competitions for men and women were all very enthusiastic and resulted in good results in the end, as can be seen in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Also, in the last day or two, overseas Chinese students spontaneously organized a sports event called the "Southeast Asian Malay Peninsula Chinese School Students' Shanghai Sports Federation," which was initiated and organized by students from Yangzheng and Zun Kong schools. Students from other schools on the island are also being solicited. However, because it is too scattered, it seems difficult to have a responsible convener, and it is difficult to form an army for a while, so they cannot participate in this association. For example, the students of the well-known Overseas Chinese Middle School in Singapore have the largest number of students in Shanghai, and their sports are not weaker than those of the students of Yangzheng and Zun Kong schools. It is also difficult for them to participate for a while, which is a pity. Now, only students from Yangzheng and Zun Kong schools are holding their own events, including football, basketball, volleyball (originally scheduled for the 13th but postponed due to rain), tennis, track and field events, and cross-country running, which will be held from 1:00 pm on the 14th of this month. The track and field events will be held, and the students of the two schools were all first- and second-class talents in their respective schools. There will definitely be a fierce competition on this day. It is also learned that the people in charge of the two schools have solicited many prizes from the school (Jinan University) principal, faculty, and staff, and the prizes from the school board solicited from the alma mater are also quite a few.</p>
<p>The author knows a brief evaluation of the talents of Yangzheng as follows: Luo Rongbiao, Lu Kangxian, Chen Fuxie, Lin Jiuhong, Lin Hele, Chen Jinshun, and Chen Guanqing are all first- and second-class talents in the sports column of Jinan University. However, the old students of Zun Kong are also not weak, such as Luo Haiguang, Chen Xingpei, Yang Jiayuan, Zhao Bohuan, Wu Rongquan, and Chen Yongcong are also first- and second-class talents on the representative seat. What is most noticeable is that Chen Xingpei once broke the national records for the 1,500-meter and 3,000-meter races, and Wu Rongquan has the reputation of Zun Kong's Liu Changchun. Especially, the American Sand Year Luo Haiguang's football and basketball have long been famous. This can be said to be a grand meeting of heroes. This kind of effort and grand event is also rare in universities in China. It is also because the failure of the Far Eastern Games stimulated the general youth of China, so they made special efforts to prepare for future revenge. (Rong Jin)</p>

<h3>The Perilous Fate of the Douqiu Field</h3>
<p>The Douqiu field is a newly invented game device by Mr. Chu Minyi. It is surrounded by thin bamboo into a circular shape, with a flat surface in the middle and gradually rising outwards. There are bamboo hoops. Two people stand on the flat surface and first push up the first ball. When it is about to fall, they push up the second ball. So it goes back and forth like this. It is said that if you can practice well, you can add up to four or five balls, but what I have seen is only playing two balls. Even Mr. Chu himself has only played two balls, but for us, even playing two balls is difficult. On the day of the completion ceremony on March 10th, it was so lively. There were no less than a thousand people who came to watch, including important officials of the National Government and masters of the martial arts world. It seemed to add a lot of color to the Sino-French Industrial College. In order to commemorate the occasion, Mr. Chu specially asked the Mingxing Film Company to make a film and transported the film to the Belgian Exposition for screening to promote the game. However, after only a short period of time, after Mr. Chu Minyi left the country, this newly invented product has become so dilapidated and fragmented. Students who do not know the value of things use it as a place to practice cycling and enjoy themselves at lightning speed. There are also those who race, and those who are curious make all kinds of tricks and do everything. Even the thin bamboo is taken out and used as a javelin. There are absolutely no people who actually play Douqiu, which makes the very solemn stadium now dilapidated. In addition, it is exposed to the sun and dew, and the wind and rain erode it, making people sigh about the past and the present. It is really the perilous fate of the Douqiu field! This has to alarm the Academic Supervision Office to issue a notice:</p>
<p>"The Mengqiu field was built by Principal Chu with his own funds to invent and promote the game. How grand was the completion ceremony! However, the students did not use it properly, and they broke and dismantled it without any regard. It is expected that it will be completely destroyed by autumn. Seeing this situation, can people not be discouraged? Later generations respected and loved the sweet pear tree where Duke Shao of Zhou rested, and they warned each other not to cut or prune it. Why are the students not as good as these illiterate farmers? At the beginning of the month, the workshop was instructed to repair it, but the funding has not been determined, so the delay has continued until today, and the damage is even worse. There are few people and many things in this office, and we cannot always take care of it. I think more than half of the 150 people must think that it should not be like this. You should use the meaning of the student's good advice to dissuade at any time if you see it. The way of being a person is to be forgiving first. The explanation of the word "forgiveness" is that what you don't want others to do to you, don't do to others. Students all know how to cherish their own things, but how can they not know how to forgive when they dismantle the Douqiu field and fences, throw balls, and destroy windows? If so, I hope you will be careful and careful."</p>

<h3>Grandeur of Guan Zilan's Solo Exhibition</h3>
<p>Miss Guan Zilan recently opened a solo exhibition of her works on the eighth floor of the Huaan Insurance Company, opposite the racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road. Yesterday was the third day of the exhibition, and the number of visitors was even more enthusiastic, a rare grand occasion in recent exhibitions. Miss Guan graduated from the China Art University a few years ago. After graduating, she went to Japan to study diligently. In the autumn of the 16th year of the Republic of China, her works were selected for the Tokyo Nikakai Exhibition. Miss Guan's style is innovative, and her brushwork is bold. She can translate the momentary interest of the object with simple and gorgeous colors. Her so-called decisive and direct style best expresses Miss Guan's unique personality. Yesterday, hundreds of people from the party and government, including Pan Gongzhan, Zhu Yingpeng, and Fan Zhengbo, and from the literary and art circles, including Shao Xunmei, Xu Beihong, Chuan Yanchang, Xu Weinan, and Ye Qiuyuan, attended the exhibition. Today is the fourth day of the exhibition, and it is said that the exhibition will only last for today.</p>
<h3>Eightieth Anniversary of Balzac</h3>
<p>Honoré de Balzac, the father of French literary realism, was born in 1799 and died in 1850. This year is 1930, so it is exactly eighty years after Balzac's death.</p>
<p>The greatness of literary figures is immeasurable, therefore we should express our commemoration of Balzac's eightieth anniversary.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it's pitiful that my acquaintance with Balzac, as someone who loves literature, only began two years ago. The first work I read of his was not a long novel, but a short story. Although long novels are especially his characteristic, two years ago I did not read French, so I read the English translation from the "Modern Library" series: "Short Stories by Honoré de Balzac". Regarding Balzac, the editor of the "Modern Library" said on the cover of this collection of short stories:</p>
<p>"Balzac is as much a short story writer as he is a long novel writer, but for some reason, his shorter stories are rarely seen in English as much as his larger works. They have vividness and clarity. In terms of structure, they are ingenious, and in terms of narrative, they are empathetic. These few short stories 'are sufficient to demonstrate Balzac's imaginative creative talent, keen observation, and accurate psychological and physiological knowledge.'"</p>
<p>"For readers who have no opportunity to get to know Balzac's larger works, these few stories are enough to explain the reason for Balzac's position as one of the world's most famous literary figures."</p>
<p>From conversations with several friends who are interested in studying literature, we admit that English translations of French novels—long or short—are often more flavorful than original English novels. Balzac's are naturally the same. Although a British author of "A History of French Literature" said that France does not have the greatest literary giant like England's Shakespeare, France is not lacking in literary figures who enjoy world fame. The literature of the emotionally rich French people resides in a garden of spring, making it lovable.</p>
<p>Balzac wrote a total of ninety-seven long novels in his lifetime. Without discussing quality, the quantity alone is enough to be astonishing. Naturally, this is not something that someone without literary talent can do.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, talented people have been most happy to do what they have the ability to do. Xiang Yu was unwilling to study books or swordsmanship, but was happy to learn how to defeat ten thousand men. Balzac was rich in literary talent, so he engaged in literary work throughout his life, enduring poverty and hardship, and constantly striving. He wanted to be a literary figure, and nothing could make him change his course.</p>
<p>It seems like an immutable law that writers are often poor. I remember when Franklin was learning to write poetry, his family advised him not to do this boring thing, saying, "Verse makers are usually beggars." Balzac's family had the same idea, but despite the circumstances, talent cannot be buried after all. Balzac's beloved sister, Madame de Surville, tells us that "in childhood, he already admired the beauty of Tours (Balzac's hometown) like an artist. He sometimes stood happily in the sunset, silently enjoying nature." The concept of loving beauty gradually emerged in Balzac's childhood.</p>
<p>Holding the view that "the effort of true literature is the noblest purpose," Balzac did so, and his family had no choice but to listen to him. His mother loved him and was helpless. Thus, he embarked on the road of literature.</p>
<p>In those days, making a living by writing was much more difficult than it is now, so we can imagine the hardship of Balzac's life. His early works can be described in his own words in a letter to his sister:</p>
<p>"I am sending you two new books. They still don't work, with very little literary meaning. In one, you may find some ridiculous things and ridiculous characters, but the plot is bad."</p>
<p>Because of his dissatisfaction, Balzac's works were revised and revised again, often up to a dozen times, completely changing the original draft. Regarding this point, it can be taken as a model for those of us who aspire to literature. We should not think that we are geniuses who can write eloquently. The world's great works are never produced in the shortest period of time. Lafcadio Hearn (Koizumi Yakumo) said, "We are happy with the ancient songs that have been handed down because they have been sung by millions of people and revised by millions of people." Balzac also thought carefully for a long time before writing the opening sentence.</p>
<p>Having said that, Balzac was by no means an incompetent author. His writing ability was by no means comparable to that of ordinary people. "Le Secret des Ruggieri" was written in just one night, "La Vieille Fille" took only three nights, and he even wrote long and valuable works in a few hours.</p>
<p>Readers must be very eager to know Balzac's time management. In his letter to Madame Zulma Carraud, he said:</p>
<p>"I want to tell you that I am immersed in a state of unconscious work. My life is mechanically changed. I sleep like poultry at six or seven o'clock in the evening, and I wake up at one o'clock in the morning. Then I work until eight o'clock. At eight o'clock, I sleep for an hour and a half, then eat something, a cup of black coffee, tidy up my private carriage, I receive guests, I take a bath, I go out. After lunch, I sleep. The harvest is extremely slow, and the debt is relentless and cannot be eliminated. Now I believe that the future will be prosperous."</p>
<p>Writers have different habits. Some people need to hold a cigarette, and some people need to drink wine to be able to write. Balzac almost treated part of the day as night and part of the night as day. The silence all around at night is an excellent time to write. Of course, he is not the only one who writes at this time, but few people get up in the middle of the night to engage in literary work.</p>
<p>Because Balzac had a fixed time to work every day, he almost lived a lonely life. Although he sometimes went to restaurants or dance halls, he was on good terms with ordinary upper-class women and made friends with Victor Hugo and George Sand, two great French literary figures of the same time as Balzac, and others.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Balzac produced many works in his lifetime. If readers want to find his works, it is best to buy the original text—French. If you cannot understand French, you can also buy the English translation. Few Chinese translations of Western novels are successful. I have never been very enthusiastic about buying them. According to my superficial knowledge, I have not personally heard of anyone introducing Balzac. I hope that those who are interested in introducing French literature will be as enthusiastic about Balzac as they are about Maupassant, Anatole France, and others.</p>
<p>The Balzac works that can be introduced here are:</p>
<h3>Recherche de l'Absolu</h3>
<p>(1) Recherche de l'Absolu – He himself thought it was a great work.</p>
<h3>Médecin de Campagne</h3>
<p>(2) Médecin de Campagne – He said, "In my opinion, this book is of greater value than law and victory. It is a representation of truth."</p>
<h3>Chouans</h3>
<p>(3) Chouans – This is the novel that first made him famous.</p>
<h3>Histoire des Treize</h3>
<p>(4) Histoire des Treize – About the philosophy of crime, betrayal, and cruelty in very different social situations.</p>
<h3>Eugénie Grandet</h3>
<p>(5) Eugénie Grandet – Talking about the tragic, touching, and troublesome aspects.</p>
<h3>Balthazar Claes</h3>
<p>(6) Balthazar Claes – One of Balzac's best works.</p>
<h3>Peau de Chagrin</h3>
<p>(7) Peau de Chagrin – This is a must-read for those who read Balzac.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, I cannot report the contents of the above Balzac works to the readers in detail, so please forgive the readers. However, I think that it is better to have someone taste a bite of chicken than to tell them how delicious the taste of chicken is for a long time. Therefore, I deeply hope that readers will buy Balzac's novels and appreciate them themselves.</p>
<p>In his later years, Balzac's economic situation became slightly better. At the age of fifty-one, he married a forty-seven-year-old Polish woman. Although his life became stable, his lung and heart disease also progressed. Thus, on August 17, 1850, he passed away.</p>
<p>Only five months after the marriage. (Yu Yi)</p>
