<h3 id="c212">關於難劇運動的來函 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>編輯先生</p>
<p>下面是我們這次難劇運動前後的簡略的報告請闢藝術界中一角的地位給我們向大衆公告並且希望藉此得一般愛好戲劇的人的指敎和協助</p>
<p>（一）舉行難劇運動底動機</p>
<p>這次我們舉行難劇運動可以說有兩個動機第一個是五月十日和十一日兩天底虧本照我們自已知道我們的觀衆是不止這些我們以爲那一定是受了電車罷工底影響所以我們想復演「文舅舅」同時怕一次「文舅舅」還不能收回我們的成本於是就决定再加演「狗底跳舞」和「桃花源」第二個動機是因爲外界一般看過我們的「桃花源」底觀衆們還時時念念不忘地在提起它於是我們想這戲很有再一演底價值同時又有一般人因爲去年我們的「狗底跳舞」只演一天而没有看到很慫恿我們再復演一次於是我們就决定同時復演三齣戲又因爲這三齣戲都是公認底難劇我們就把這三齣戲作爲一個有系統的難劇運動</p>
<p>（二）預定底劇目</p>
<p>在我們的獻詞裏我們已經解釋明白我們原來的劇目是這樣的運動底第一聲是「狗底跳舞」第二聲是「文舅舅」第三聲是「桃花源」由絶望而到希望由希望而到積極但是因爲「狗底跳舞」和「文舅舅」有幾個角色是兼演的怕個性底走失還是先把「文舅舅」第一個演了再有其他原因也只得把我們理想的劇目改動了　　（三）運動期中底種種困難</p>
<p>（一）觀衆底衡少在三十一日復演「文舅舅」底一天我們發現我們的觀衆比前更少了於是我們明白我們是失了我們原有的觀衆了因了這個緣故有不少的團員像桃花源第二幕底桃仙一樣地灰心起來可是幸喜我們還有着那隱者一般的團員才互相鼓勵着使完成了這次的運動</p>
<p>（二）散了帮手我們失了我們觀衆底緣故我們很知道就因爲我們演底戲太深奥太沉悶同時也因爲這個内部底團員也感不到興趣失散了這次舉行這樣個大運動我們人手總共起來只有二十個左右這使我們驕傲也使我們痛心（三）職演員底更動在這樣少的人手底時候我們的事務管理洪承祓和布景主任吳森康各因了家庭底事不得不回甬直到六號才回申我們的重要演員羅鳴鳳和唐遠藩一個历爲職業上底重要事務一個因爲復旦排演「西哈諾」也都辭去了他們任務因此我們的組織有些紛亂職權也不能劃清同時舞台上底職演員也都不能專心預備戲而來帮忙前台底工作了</p>
<p>（四）排戲底困難這次運動中底三齣戲「文舅舅」是排熟了的但「狗底舞跳」已隔了一年「桃花源」更隔了二年多而還要改動很多角色所以非重排不可的可是我們簡直抽不出多大工夫來像「桃花源」我們是完全到七號晚上大家犧牲了一夜的睡眠排成的</p>
<p>（五）經濟底窘迫外界們平常感到我們的劇團經濟很充足是的照我們底開支看起來却是像很富裕了可是我們這些錢只都費在舞台上别說職演員不敢有非分的享受就是廣告底錢都是非常吝嗇的自然了比起更貧窮的劇團來我們似乎要有力量得多但也正因爲這樣我們想竭盡我們的力在舞台技術上有較完美的貢獻可是我們的膽太大了這次我們的虧本也許要超出一千以外現在還有一大半賬未付要是這一星期内我們不能辦理妥當說不定我們會因此到不堪設想的地步</p>
<p>（四）運動底結果</p>
<p>（一）外界對於我們這次我們的觀衆雖然很少但是這些都是淘汰下來的他們都是眞正贊助我們和愛好我們的戲劇底觀衆所以他們是滿意我們這次的運動的還有文藝界也部從口頭上對於我們表示了滿意</p>
<p>（二）我們對於外界這次我們非常感謝外界這並不是因爲他們對於我們底稱許而是他們給我們底誠懇底指正凡是可能的我們都接受了還有申報上曾批評我們「桃花源」底椿君和民國日報上批評我們「文舅舅」底椿森君不知是不是一個人更不知是誰他對於我們的前途抱着很大的希望我們感激他我們總像秦姑娘一般含辛茹苦像桃仙一般堅忍不拔不使他失望</p>
<p>（三）我們自已對於自已雖然外界對於我們這次運動都表示了滿意但是我們自已却都很抱憾各人的臉上都有頗不自滿的神色因爲缺點是只有自已最清楚的我們都没有做到我們的理想在這一點上我們可以告訴一般關心我們底同志們我們似乎還有前進底希望</p>
<p>（四）這次運動底代表戲戲劇是一種總合藝術這裏面底組織誰都知道是多麽複雜只要有一個職員或演員失誤就會弄糟全劇這次我們因爲人手底缺少事務底繁忙使我們的戲不能像機械一樣每次都一個式子（我們從前是這樣的）有幾次我們實在還不敢承認是我們的戲不過在六場「文舅」中我們承認五月十號白天的兩塲狗底跳舞中我們承認六月七號白天的兩塲桃花源中我們承認八號晚上的我們承認這三塲是我們這次運動底代表戲</p>
<p>（五）我們的以後</p>
<p>（一）要回我們的觀衆和我們的帮手我們以後第一件事就是想法要回我們原有的觀衆和帮手我們專選難劇是我們的成功但是我們因此而失敗了我們的觀衆和帮手同時也是我們的失敗所以我們要想法要回他們</p>
<p>（二）我們以後的方針在中國戲劇才萌芽底時候觀衆對於新的戲劇還没有興趣和信仰底時候我們還没有把京劇底觀衆的心理底時候演這種難劇也是一種錯誤的方針所以我們以後要改變方針要演比較得到觀衆同情的戲或者是比較淺近的戲不過望關心我們的人們不要爲我們抱悲觀我們要要像設立小學想法分好時期好像分班次一樣順序的進行</p>
<p>（三）内部底改組朱穗丞君有個很好的計劃想把我們的組織改變分觀劇團員和工作團員平常時候要常有訓練來提高觀劇者底和工作者底戲劇程度現在這個提議還只是大家私人方面底商酌等這次的事都舒齊以後就要付委員會詳細討論待議决後自然將有進步的努力辛酉劇團啓十九年六月十四日</p>
<h3 id="c213">資格問題與大學敎育 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>讀者先生</p>
<p>我很想和你們討論這個問題只因事務困人忽忽終日到了今天能下筆我想討論這個問題的動機就是在兩個月以前當全國敎育會議開幕的時候上海時事新報的一位記者在他的報紙裏登了一篇論文講及現在的大學敎育的我讀了很發生一點感想後來這篇論文天津國聞週報（忘記在第幾期也把牠轉載了這篇論文之值得注意可見是無可置疑的了這篇論文的大意就是（因爲手頭没有這份報紙不便翻查只好記述大意了）</p>
<p>「現在的大學敎育程度太低了比起初辦學校的時候還要退步至有江河日下之感就拿求學的工具丨文字來說前時的大學生除了本國文字之外最起碼的兩三種外文字現在的大學生呢外國文字不能精通也不用說了就是本國文字也比不上從前的中小學生甚至有的連寫一張普通信札也不能通順所以現在的當務之急就是充實大學課程的内容提高大學敎育的程度」</p>
<p>這篇論文的意思在顯示現在大學敎育的狀况促現在的敎育當局和社會人士加以注意於此可知大學敎育程度的低淺是一種很顯明的事實而社會有識之士之所引以爲病又是「人同此心心同此理」的了但是我們想想現在大學敎育的程度何以會比從前要低總該有個原因的把這個原因找到了我們就會對症下藥否則無論你用什麽方法改革都是不行的但是所謂原因當然有好幾種我們要找到的就是最根本的原因於是我就下了一番考察工夫考察什麽是現在大學敎育程度低淺的根本原因啊不期然而然我一想出就是「資格」這個東西我敢主張「資格的問題一天不能打破大學敎育的程度一天不能提高」然而「資格問題」在今日政治上敎育上正在根深蒂固牢不可破的時候這種主張人們必定以爲是瘋人所發的所以不能不把資格問題與大學敎育詳加討論大學敎育程度不好的原因照一般人的淺薄推測總以爲理在留學東西洋回國的學生太多了這幾年來的新官僚和失意政客也太多了留學生没有事幹就想辦大學官僚政客想得虚名和拉攏學生也想辦大學這兩種人都想大學於是形成野鷄大學遍地都是了野鷄大學設立的動機根本不在乎敎育所以濫收學生設備簡陋敎授馬虎結果學生程度安得不淺野鷄大學旣多學生不愁没有地方升學於是影響到中學生也不大注意功課了中學程度旣差大學程度安得不淺結果非野鷄大學的程度也淺了所以提高大學敎育程度的辦法就是查封野鷄大學我以爲這種推測的理由是表面的這種提高大學敎育程度的辦法雖然我也相對的承認但究不是根本的我們試進一步想想能野鷄大學設立之多固然以留學生没有事做官僚政客之想沽名釣譽和拉攏學生爲其基因但每問野鷄大學總有三五百學生以上入大學的人這麽多牠的原因又在那裏呢現在的大學生丨丨尤其是在野雞大學丨丨每年至少要花五百塊錢他們的父兄自然不是個個都是資本家他們難道肯把這許許多的血汗錢給他們的兒女去消遣消遣麽現在大學程度的靠不住他們難道盡不懂得麽然而辛辛苦苦供給子女入大學的倒一天一天加多了其中總有個原因罷這不用說就是現在社會生活困難非有大學畢業的頭銜不能在社會謀得相當的位置尤其想做官的非有大學畢業頭銜不能乘風雲而直上丨丨得要人抬舉固然不在此例但也會有「私人」之誚了丨丨就是將來國家考試也要有大學文憑始准投考所以可一言以蔽之曰「今日父兄之供給子弟入大學其目的在乎「資格」學生之入大學讀書其目的亦在乎「資格」」資格之外都是不很重要的問題那麽大學敎育程度安得不淺還有因學生求學之目的祇在於得「資格」所以有學問的敎授就常常發生這樣的概歎「我很辛苦地講授也不過替他們製造文憑罷了這何苦來」眞的目的不在乎學問而在得「資格」的學生們要求免考减少題目多發講義少看參考書的確給有學問的敎授太難受了因此有點錢的就不想去敎大學而今日的大學敎育就建築於學生的文憑敎師的薪水上面這句說話許我的大學學生和敎授都給我首肯了這樣大學敎育程度安得不淺於此大家可以下一個公平的判語究竟大學敎育程度低淺的根本原因是在於野鷄大學設立之多還是在於社會一般人對於資格問題的重視呢我們馬上可　答出來非一般人有資</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>格問題的需要則野　大學絶對不能辦得成功大學敎育程度低淺的原因全在於社會一般人對於資格問　之重視以大學敎育程度的低淺歸咎於野鷄大學是表面上的理論並且是倒果爲因的所以要提高大學敎育的程度先要打破資格的問題就是社會需要的那一種人才都要經過國家考試這種考試絶不應限以資格要顧及他的平日修養只要加以嚴格的考騐學位的授予也是這樣那麽大學敎育程度自然會提高了（鍥鑲）</p>
<h3 id="c214">幾句令人猛省的話葛子米 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>開辦在滬三十多年之南洋中學日前在中華田徑塲舉行春季運動會數百健兒爭於綠草如茵之廣塲上一顯我好身手其中有四項成績阄打破該校最高紀錄以中等學校得此良好成績殊可嘉也其新紀錄如下</p>
<p>百米（黃冠雄）成績十一秒三</p>
<p>千五百米（梁延平）成績四分三十二秒</p>
<p>低欄（黃成楝）成績二十八秒</p>
<p>鐵餅（潘日昇）成績二五六八咪</p>
<p>六月十二日在該校校友廳給優勝者奬品計師長校友來賓同學到會者共千餘人奬品極爲豐富發奬者爲該校敎務主任顧天放先生先生新由日本孝察華僑敎育回國在會演說約半小時所言語語中肯令人猛省不少值此亟需提倡體育時期誠可以金科玉律視之兹將所言掇述一二以供於世諸君其三思之</p>
<p>「我在日本參觀各中小學見其校舍雖負盛名者亦淺陋不堪絶少高廳大厦至於運動塲亦不甚廣大蓋日本地小人衆不得不然也運動塲旣小故練習時間必須互相輪值方可免一部份學生向隅練習時間雖少而其成績能卓著者以其有恒心也今我較之運動塲較之日本之普通學校者誠有過無不及如此大好機會諸君幸勿失之</p>
<p>在日本絶少見有面色白晳如我人者因人民喜運動在日光下運動致變成黑色久之人民亦移其愛美之觀念以黑者爲健者之象徵而深愛之於此可見其國民性之一般以此視我國之崇尚「白面書生」又何如耶</p>
<p>日本人無分男女老小均喜運動往往於作業之餘於屋旁小路作擲球蹴球之劇以此視我國國人之於暇時打麻雀抽香烟又何如耶</p>
<p>日本人之於運動有恒心有毅力不若我國運動員之一曝十寒如遠東運動會足球一項日人早想染指於是掽命練習一面不惜重資遣派球員往美國學習新法到於技術方面我國固不無進步但僅知墨守舊法耳故作戰時日方用出一種新公式我國球員即莫明其妙起來日人雖不能奪得整個錦標亦足吐氣一時矣</p>

<p>商榷轉學問題</p>
<p>「你也知道我吧我是最愛護我們學校的人因爲我們學校一切的一切雖不能盡滿人意可是在滬上各私立大學中也無妨自詡爲野雞中的鳳　了單講法律係吧主任是由法學博士的校長先生兼任各位敎授一半兒是東吳法律學院的敎授一半兒是臨時法院的庭長推事可算得集上海法界人才之大成招收新生不得任意揷班在校學生不得無故曠課就這幾點我們常自詡我校的法律系爲東吳法律學院之第二我們在這樣的學校裏求學本可不必作出國谷而遷喬木之想以靜待畢業可是難題就來了呢</p>
<p>我們最大的難題想你也明白就是學校的立案問題我們知道一個學法律的學生不是畢業於國立大學或已經敎育部立案及司法院認可之私立大學的法學院那末他或好所拿到的畢業文憑等於一張廢紙法律上是不生效力的要考法官做律師都不行的我們學校的當局當然也感覺到這個問題的重要所以在上一學期已經努力籌措基金和購置基地可是校基雖購定了五十畝而校舍之建築經過了一學期還聽不到好消息呢我敢斷言我們的學校只須一建校舍便可得到敎育部立案而司法部之認可更不成問題唉校舍立案先决問題的校舍學校當局爲何不急起進行以慰全體同學雲霓之望呢江灣路上的法學院正在添建校舍不是我們同學所各親見的麽觸景生情我們應作何感想</p>
<p>劍兄我本人是絶對愛護我們學校的可是我的家長逼着我要轉學說我再不轉學便自絶了出路聰明的劍兄你以爲等候着我校日後立案的好呢還是立即轉學的好呢假定轉學的話滬上最好的法律學校當然要推東吳可是我的英文程度夠不上那末究竟應轉入那個學校請你一併指敎我」</p>
<p>上面是一個同學寫給我的一封信我們學校的法律系辦得不差這是事實如此如其轉學呢除東吳外不免降格以求學校當局進行立案之不力這也事實如此如其不轉學呢未免吃虧了自已的出路我眞無法答覆這個問題不過我相信我校於二年之内一定可以建舍立案學校一經立案已畢業學生也同樣受到利益所以目前如其没有其他必要轉學的原因或是一時無相當的學校可轉還是不轉爲是便以此意答覆了我的同學</p>
<p>我更感覺到全滬同學因學校立案問題而連帶發生了轉學問題的一定不在少數但看已立案學校的每期吸收大批轉學生便可明白所以把這同學來信發表以見學校一時不能立案也是學生轉學原因之一而值得大家注意的啊</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Fourth Route Army Occupies Yue Lu Mountain <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Navy Occupies the Xiangyin River Surface to Cover the Wu-Chang Route Armies</p>
<p>Hankou - The General Headquarters issued a total attack order on the 16th, setting a deadline to eliminate Zhang Gui's Fourth Route Army. On the morning of the 16th, it had already occupied Yue Lu Mountain, confronting the enemy troops in Changsha across the river. The Eighth Route of Jiang's Division entered the territory of Xiangtan, and the vanguard of the Fourteenth Brigade of the Fiftieth Division reached Changshou Street. The navy occupied the Xiangyin River surface to cover the frontal army of Wu-Chang Route, launching an offensive towards Polo with great momentum. It is rumored that Li Zongren has left Changsha, and the troops there have been retreating towards Zhuzhou since the evening of the 14th. The Eighth Army of Pingjiang, led by Zhou Lan, retreated towards Wukou Changle Street. The National Army plans to recover Changsha on the evening of the 16th or the morning of the 17th. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Hankou - The squadron dispatched nine aircraft led by Zhang Yougu, which entered Hunan four times on the 15th and bombed, all hitting the targets. On the 16th, they went to bomb again. The armored train "Xiang E" is responsible for patrolling along the Wu-Yue Road. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Hankou - Military news: Chen Shaokuan led the Chu-class warships to advance towards Changsha on the 16th to attack. The artillery fire was fierce, and the enemy was overwhelmed. Chen has issued an order to capture Changsha within a certain period. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Hankou - He Yingqin reported at the memorial week in the General Headquarters on the 16th that the central government's military arrangements for Hunan have been properly arranged and Changsha will be recovered within three days, and Zhang Gui will be cleared within two weeks. (16th)</p>
<p>Hankou - Qian Dajun went to Hunan by car on the 16th to supervise the war and appointed Chen Minmo as the director of the Wuchang office to preside over the rear affairs. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Hankou - He Jian sent Zhao Songhai as the liaison staff of the 13th Division. Zhao arrived in Hankou on the 16th to visit Xia Douyin and negotiate. Chen Guangzu and Li Wenming returned to defense first on the 16th. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Nanjing - Military News: Chen Shaokuan led a large number of warships to fiercely attack Changsha again at dawn on the 16th. Zhang Gui's rebel army was greatly shocked. It was heard that the artillery fire of each warship was fierce and hit the key points. (10th)</p>
<p>Nanjing - Hankou Telegram on the 16th: (1) He Jian telegraphed to Hankou that after our army captured Ningxiang, the enemy was retreating to Changsha. Now he is leading his troops to pursue. Also, many local militias are serving us, and the rebels are fleeing in fear. (2) Chen Jitang telegraphed to Hankou that on the 15th, he led the Independent First Brigade and the Ninth Brigade to Shaoguan and immediately entered Hunan to command the encirclement and suppression of the Gui rebels.

<h3 id="e9">The Impact of the New US Tariff <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Countries with developed industries and perfect organizations only seek to sell manufactured goods abroad, so they mostly advocate free trade. Those with imperfect organizations only seek to sell domestic goods in the domestic market, so they adopt protectionist policies. Therefore, in recent years, except for one or two major countries with developed industries in Europe, the rest have built high tariff barriers to implicitly resist. However, the higher the tariff rate, the higher the price, which is also very unfavorable to the country. Therefore, there was a tariff truce meeting. The only formidable enemy recognized by the participating countries at that time was the United States. Therefore, the meeting on the one hand discussed stopping the increase of tariffs, and on the other hand discussed European economic cooperation, secretly trying to consolidate itself. However, before the closing of the meeting, a tariff war had already been triggered between Europe and the United States. As reported by the French newspaper the day before yesterday, the United States proposed to increase the import tariff rate by an average of one time, especially for lace and other items. France was greatly affected, so it also proposed to increase the automobile tariff rate to retaliate. This move is nothing more than the beginning of the tariff war between Europe and the United States. Now, looking at the new tariff bill passed by the US Senate and House of Representatives, there are 887 types of tax increases and only 235 types of tax reductions. Moreover, there are 48 types of taxes on velvet, cotton, leather, and shoes that were previously untaxed. It is certain that the United States has implemented a high tariff of protectionism. In the future, it will not only affect our country, but also the countries of Europe. The disadvantage to the Americans is undoubtedly greater. The Americans are uneasy and fear that it will cause retaliation from various countries, which is also expected. The United States has always been proud of its developed industry and should not benefit from protectionism. However, today, the import of foreign goods cannot be stopped, and exports are forced to decrease due to the environment. It is inevitable that it will tend to heavy taxes. It is not necessarily intentional to challenge various countries. However, at this time of economic hardship and commercial fatigue, the price of goods has suddenly risen due to the high price of gold, and the price of goods has risen again due to heavy taxes. Isn't this a path to collective suicide?</p>

<p>Nanjing - Regarding the problem of recovering the rights to the Great Eastern and Great Northern submarine cables, the Ministry of Communications has notified the Eastern managers of the two companies stationed in Shanghai to convene a second meeting at the Ministry at 3:00 pm on the 18th. The managers are responsible for representing their company and will be able to arrive in Beijing as scheduled. At that time, separate meetings will be held, or joint meetings will be held due to mutual connection. It must be decided on an ad hoc basis. According to the Ministry of Communications, there are about 20 items of such contracts as submarine cable landing, sharing of telegram fees, and borrowing cables, each with several items of text and attachments. The content is very complicated and there is no need to study each one individually. It is only necessary to first decide on the entire new principle in accordance with the most fair international law. According to this principle, new conditions will be set. For example, if the submarine cable landing is required, the other party must set aside the word "right" and abide by the laws of the National Government and respect the inherent economic and transportation sovereignty of China within a considerable scope to obtain the mutual benefits allowed by the Chinese government, otherwise there will be no room for compromise. As for the debt problem in the connection, the then Beiyang government mortgaged telecommunications to borrow money for other political activities. Until now, the National Government still has to bear the debt, which is already overwhelming. Recently, the price of sterling has risen, and it will suffer significant losses invisibly.

<h3 id="e43">Hoover's Declaration on <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>New Tariff Law</p>
<p>President May Revise at Any Time If Needed</p>
<p>Opponents Say It Only Increases the People's Burden</p>
<p>Washington, June 15th (Associated Press) - President Hoover commented on the new tariff law today, saying that it fulfills the Republican Party's promise of 1928. Although there may be some items that are too high or too low, there is a provision that allows the President to amend it as appropriate to the circumstances. Therefore, this flexible clause is the most important step in the bill, so that tariff rates can be quickly changed when necessary without hindering commerce. The bill will be signed by the Vice President tomorrow and sent to the President on the same evening or the next morning. As for the views of various parties, conservative Republican leaders are generally satisfied, although some items are still considered to have rates that are too low. Democrats and Republicans in agricultural areas still expressed opposition, saying that it deceives the public and makes the people spend 100 million yuan annually to benefit a small number of large manufacturers.</p>
<p>Washington, June 15th (Reuters) - President Hoover declared that he would approve the tariff bill and stated that if the flexibility provisions in the bill were not sufficient to allow him to make revisions when needed, he would request greater authority. He also said that if some countries complain that the tariff rates are too high, they can submit a formal complaint to the Tariff Commission, and if their reasons are sufficient, a remedy can be found.</p>
<p>Paris, June 16th (Reuters) - The Paris Echo commented on US President Hoover's declaration on the tariff bill, saying that France would have to retaliate. The United States will reap what it sows because its industrial products account for half of its exports. Sooner or later, the United States will realize this.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Trade with China Is Sluggish <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Affected by the Severe Drop in Silver Prices</p>
<p>Japan News - The plunge in silver prices is unprecedented. Japan's trade with China reached more than 530 million yuan last year, and this time it has been severely hit. Moreover, the situation in the silver market is uncertain, and exporters are very worried. In addition, domestic demand is declining, and they are trying to actively sell to our country in order to alleviate the accumulation of goods. Unexpectedly, the sharp drop in silver bullion has brought them to the brink of despair. If the situation continues, a major panic will inevitably occur in the future.</p>
<p>Japan's trade volume with China last year: Cotton fabrics: 150,115 (unit: 1,000 yuan); Refined sugar: 22,084; Paper: 16,398; Wheat flour: 15,671; Coal: 12,555; Rayon: 9,000; Yongmending: 1,708.</p>
<p>"Cotton silk cloth" once had a short-term expansion plan, but due to the cheapness of silver, it is difficult to maintain market prices. Moreover, this item accounts for the largest share of trade with China, so it has been hit the hardest. "Refined sugar" has seen continuous declines in silver prices since last winter and early spring, and Shanghai vendors have successively gone bankrupt, making transactions almost impossible. It is fortunate that exports have decreased by more than 20% this year, but it is feared that exports from Java to China will also decrease accordingly, which will inevitably lead to further indirect adverse effects. "Paper" - Due to weak domestic demand in Japan, active efforts are being made to promote export incentives. According to comparisons at the end of March, the quantity increased by about 45% compared with the same period last year, and the value also increased by 15%, which is quite reassuring. Its export protection policy is worthy of attention. "Wheat flour" - At the end of May, the exports for the first half of the year were about 2.1 million bags, a decrease of more than 40% compared with last year. Most of it was sold to various parts of our country. However, in June and July, our country will have wheat available on the market, so Japan's exports may not have much hope in terms of price. "Coal" - Japan's domestic coal storage has accumulated to 2.5 million tons, so it is eager to sell overseas. However, the exchange rate is unfavorable and it is difficult to obtain profits. Although the price is cheaper than last year, it is about 3 yuan or so. Progress can only be made after the silver bullion stabilizes. "Rayon" - The export volume to China accounts for one-third of the total exports. The exports calculated at the end of April decreased by half to 1.27 million yuan from 2.86 million yuan last year. Moreover, due to the low labor wages in Shanghai recently, our country's machine industry has developed, almost plunging Japan into poverty. Cotton-woven products, which used to sell well, have become even more depressed. Tianjin is hopeless, and Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Xiamen are also difficult to trade due to exchange rate issues. "Iron and steel" - Last year, the Kamaishi Mine transported 500 tons of round steel to our country. Therefore, Japanese steel manufacturers are working hard to export to China in order to dispose of their inventories. Unexpectedly, the sharp drop in silver prices has made their efforts come to naught. (June 12th, Yanhua)</p>

<p>Greatly Reduced Last Month</p>
<p>Washington, June 15th (Associated Press) - According to the U.S. Department of Commerce's statistics for May, exports were only worth US$322,000,000, the lowest export figure for the month of April since 1924. Imports also fell sharply, totaling US$285,000,000, also the lowest figure for the same month since 1924. According to commercial experts, this unfavorable phenomenon is due to a large decrease in U.S. cotton exports. Cotton exports in April fell sharply to US$31.1 million, and in May, they shrank to US$19 million. In May, cash continued to flow in, with total exports amounting to US$23.3 million, but this figure is only half of that in April.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Central Authorities Hold <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Memorial Service for the Premier's Guangzhou Calamity</p>
<p>On the morning of the 16th, at 9:00 a.m., the Central Party Headquarters held a memorial service for the Premier's Guangzhou Calamity in the auditorium. Central Committee members Hu Hanmin, Dai Chuanxian, Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Wang Zhengting, Shao Yuanchong, Jiao Yitang, Chen Lifu, Enhe Batu, Gui Chongji, Kexing'e, Chen Zhaoying, and representatives of various agencies, as well as staff members from various departments and offices of the Central Authorities, totaling about six to seven hundred people, attended. Sun Ke presided over the ceremony. After the ceremony, the chairman reported briefly, saying that in the 11th year of the Republic of China, the Premier conducted the Northern Expedition, believing that the Gui clique, Lu Rongting and Mo Rongxin, had already been defeated, and Chen Mingjiong was originally a revolutionary comrade. Initially, he did not expect him to have other intentions, but Chen was short-sighted and had great ambitions, regarding Guangdong as his only territory and wanting to manipulate all forces, disregarding the future of the country and the revolution. He obstructed the Northern Expedition plan in every possible way and secretly sabotaged it. He refused to provide anything needed for military affairs. Although the Premier was open and frank and repeatedly enlightened him, it was not enough to quell his rebellious plot. He colluded with Zhao Hengti of Hunan to create obstacles. Before long, he transferred his troops to Guangzhou, pretending to retreat while secretly plotting rebellion. Suddenly, on the evening of June 15th, he issued an order to surround Guanyin Mountain and launched a fierce attack with artillery fire. The Premier remained calm. From 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., he still convened a meeting to discuss the reorganization of municipal affairs. By 7:00 p.m., the situation was very urgent. The defending troops on Guanyin Mountain were few and difficult to resist, so he devised a way to escape. After boarding the ship, he was almost in danger because there was no external rescue. It can be seen that those unfaithful party members who indulge in selfish interests, even if they are not warlords, can also turn into warlords and even surrender to warlords, making them more dangerous than warlords. Just like the Reorganization Faction and the Western Hills Faction, although they had a history of being partisans within our party, they also joined the warlords to help them betray the party and harm the country. If we look at Chen Jiongming's betrayal of the Premier and his subsequent annihilation, we can believe that they are heading for destruction. Now, while the soldiers at the front are sacrificing and fighting bravely, the comrades in the rear should also work harder and emulate the Premier's spirit of perseverance and resoluteness in order to thwart the forces of rebellion and save the critical situation. Then, Hu Hanmin gave a speech, saying that when the Premier discussed the Northern Expedition with Chen Jiongming, Chen said that he needed 10 million bullets and 5 million yuan in military expenses. This supply could not be arranged without six months. In fact, this amount was not difficult to obtain in Guangzhou, but he wanted to use this to restrain him. Later, seeing that the Premier's determination to launch the Northern Expedition was firm, he colluded with Zhao Hengti of Hunan and Chen Guangyuan of Jiangxi to plot a rebellion. He used methods of cutting off supplies to the troops directly commanded by the Premier. At this time, Chen's rebellious intentions were already obvious, but the Premier still remained calm because the original plan to use Guilin as the rear was inevitably hindered, so he changed his route and went out of Shaoguan. On the one hand, he ordered the reduction of Chen's power. As a result, Chen's heart to rebel became even more urgent. Before the incident, the Premier returned to the province from Shaoguan. Someone said that Chen had other intentions and should be considered carefully to avoid danger, but the Premier was not afraid at all. After the change, he boarded the ship for more than 50 days. The ship was small and was under artillery fire all day long. Chen also incited his troops to spread bombs and mines in an attempt to harm him, but he finally managed to escape. When passing through Xiamen, foreigners intervened for no reason. The Premier said that this is our country's territory and I am the master of the territory. How can I be hindered by others? After much negotiation, he was able to pass through. After the Premier arrived in Shanghai, he was not discouraged by this, and his determination to uphold justice and save the country remained unchanged. Before long, he wiped out Chen Jiongming and removed the obstacles in the rear, so the Northern Expedition was successful. It can be said that although the Premier suffered a calamity on that day, his doctrine was not harmed and became even brighter. The comrades of our party should continue the Premier's spirit so that the second and third Chen Jiongming can be wiped out together, and the party and the country can be safe and secure. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 a.m. after the speeches.</p>
<p>National Government - The National Government held a memorial service for the Premier at 10:00 a.m. after the Premier's Memorial Week. Tan Yankai, Hu Hanmin, Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Shao Yuanchong, Jiang Menglin, Liu Ruiheng, Zhang Nanxian, Zhou Yawei, Chen Yi, Lin Xiang, and the heads and deputy heads of various departments, as well as government officials, totaling more than 300 people, attended. Tan Yankai presided over the ceremony. After the ceremony, Tan delivered a speech, saying that today is the eighth anniversary of the Premier's Guangzhou Calamity. We should have many thoughts when we commemorate the Premier and recall eight years ago. Now, our position is different from eight years ago. The reason why we have such achievements is due to the Premier's great spirit. Therefore, when we commemorate the Premier today, we should recall the Premier's great spirit eight years ago and the difficult and arduous situation at that time, and strive to invigorate ourselves. The military affairs have not yet ended, and we should follow the Premier's instructions and encourage ourselves from time to time, and examine whether we can strive hard so as not to fail the significance of today's commemoration. Then, Hu Hanmin delivered a speech, saying that we have learned a great lesson after the Premier's Calamity. All military personnel should be aware of the importance of self-caution and should not regard the country's army as their own. Only in this way can they be followers of the Premier and not fail the significance of today's commemoration.

<p>On the morning of the 16th, at 10:00 a.m., the National Government held the Premier's Memorial Week. Tan Yankai, Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Chen Yi, Zhang Nanxian, Liu Ruiheng, Wang Jiazhen, Li Jinlun, Jiang Menglin, Li Zhonggong, Chen Yu, Lin Xiang, and more than 300 officials from the National Government's civil and military departments attended. Tan Yankai presided over the ceremony. After the ceremony, Secretary Qian Changzhao gave a political report as follows:</p>
<p>"In terms of military affairs, the Ping-Han and Long-Hai railways are very smooth. The elite troops of Yan and Feng have been wiped out. Although Kaifeng and Zhengzhou have not yet been recovered, our side will make significant progress within days, and Yan and Feng's entire line will definitely collapse. Our defenses on the Jinpu Railway are very solid, and Jinan is not in any danger. As for the remnants of Zhang and Gui fleeing into Hunan, they are short of supplies and ammunition. Our army, navy, and air force are encircling and attacking from all sides at the same time, and their annihilation is not a problem. In short, the situation is very optimistic, and after this rebellion is quelled, the country should be able to enjoy a long period of peace. The Chairman is working hard at the front, and we should work harder. First, we must remain calm. Recently, there have been rumors from outside, especially from foreign newspapers in Shanghai, which publish groundless news every day. We must not only disbelieve them, but also have the responsibility to dispel the rumors. Last year, when the Gui clique and Feng Tang rebelled, those foreign newspapers also spread rumors in the same way. As a result, the facts proved their falsehood. The public should not be deceived again. The Mongolian Conference closed on the 13th. Despite the rebellion of Feng and Yan, the delegates came from afar and did not avoid hardships. Their spirit is commendable. During the ten days of the conference, there were as many as 125 proposals discussed. The review was extremely thorough, and the passage was also very cautious, so the results were good. In the future, I hope that all resolutions will be implemented in order. This is not only the happiness of Mongolia, but also the happiness of the Republic of China. I believe that all the delegates will work hard when they return to Mongolia, and the Central Authorities will definitely take the responsibility to help them develop Mongolia. As for the fact that human and financial resources are limited, then among the various undertakings, we can first handle the three most urgent matters: transportation, education, and sanitation, and strive to proceed as soon as possible within the possible scope. As for the issue of gold being expensive and silver being cheap, I have talked about it several times during Memorial Week. Because this issue is very complex, I can only roughly analyze its causes and effects, and I have always avoided going into the details. Sometimes, I offer my humble opinions to you for reference, and I am also afraid of being ignorant and dare not presume to be right, and I dare not criticize the opinions of others. However, there is one point that seems to be worth noting now. After the trend of gold being expensive and silver being cheap occurred, most people believed that our country's economy would go bankrupt, and as a result, they became very pessimistic. At the same time, some people believed that this was a great opportunity to revitalize industry, and so they became active. However, I feel that it is not right for us to cry along with others when there is a problem. However, it is also a bit too early to be optimistic without a sufficient reason for being active. In short, the expensiveness of gold and the cheapness of silver are harmful or beneficial to our country. How to reduce the harmful effects and how to ensure that the opportunity is not missed is the most important thing. As for the various methods, they still need to be studied by experts."</p>

<h3 id="e53">Special Committee on Electrical Rights Suspended <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Meeting Has Made No Progress in a Month</p>
<p>Russian Members Are Not Sincere at All</p>
<p>Harbin News - Li Deyan, representative of the Transportation Committee of the East China Railway Electrical Rights Conference, returned to Liaoning by train on the evening of the 9th. It is said that this trip was to report to the Transportation Committee on the negotiations of the Electrical Rights Conference over the past month and to request instructions on all measures to relieve the current deadlock in the conference. It is difficult to predict whether it will continue to be convened around the middle of next week after his return to Harbin. As of this moment, the East China Railway Electrical Rights Conference has been shelved. To summarize the situation of the conference in one month, it has made no progress, but it has spent some time and created a conference name. The reason is that on May 10, the Chinese and Russian sides each appointed three members to convene the so-called Special Committee meeting, the purpose of which was to decide on the proposals of the General Assembly. Because each member had their own job, it was stipulated that they would hold three meetings a week and divide into groups for discussion. In the first week, the Russian members were still勉强able to attend, but later they either made excuses for having something to do or for going out, resulting in an unwarranted流会cancellation. In total, only four or five meetings were held before and after, and what was discussed was still fruitless. Originally, the Russian side was fooling around, and the conference did not intend to convene the meeting, so its members were also not sincere in holding the meeting. It was not until the end of May that they勉强 reluctantly set a proposal for paying for a domestic line, allowing the Chinese side to submit it for discussion at the formal meeting. Since then, there has been no news. Li Deyan believed that such meeting procedures were迂迴 circuitous, and if he hoped that all proposals would be completely adopted, it would be遥遥无期 a distant dream. Therefore, he stopped the Special Committee and decided to negotiate with Kenisov, the Russian Chairman. The Russian side had expressed their agreement, but the Special Committee closed for many days. Li invited Kenisov to meet and discuss, but he避匿不见 avoided him. Li returned to Liaoning to request instructions because he could not get results. (11th)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Recent News on the Northeast Communist Party Case <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang News - Since the resolution of the Middle East Road Incident, the communist party's conspiracy to disrupt the Northeast has not abated. Although the authorities are taking strict precautions, it is difficult to detect the踪迹诡秘 mysterious traces of these people. Since Du Lanting, Zhao Zihe, and the other three were arrested for disrupting the Diplomatic Association, they confessed after repeated confidential interrogations that they came from Harbin to Shenyang to organize the Manchurian Communist Party and the Manchurian Youth Communist Party, preparing to riot on May 1st. The Gendarmerie Headquarters then took a certain communist party member who had surrendered and searched 19 secret agencies inside and outside the city according to the map, seizing a large number of documentary evidence and arresting 39 important personnel (including</p>

<p>the three arrested by the Diplomatic Association). They were sent to the First Prison. After investigation, those who were less involved, such as Yuan Xiaoying, the head of teaching affairs at Pingdan Middle School, Liu Luchen, a teacher of English, and Cui Guozheng, the fourth section chief of the Finance Department (Cui is the连襟 brother-in-law of Zhang Zhenlu, the head of the Finance Department, and Zhang provided personal guarantees), were released on bail first. The rest were detained because the case was important. Chen Xingya, commander of the Northeast Gendarmerie, recently requested and was approved by Commander Zhang to organize a special court attached to the Military Law Office of the Northeast Border Defense Commander's Office. Chen Xingya was publicly elected as the presiding judge, and Yan Wenhai, the chief of the Military Law Office, and Kong Zhaoyan, the president of the High Court, were appointed as trial members. It has been formally established. The situation of the trial is still kept secret by the relevant parties. The prisoners held in the First Prison are also opened another prison room, and personnel are sent by the Gendarmerie Headquarters to guard them, and they are not allowed to communicate with the outside world. It can be seen that it is serious. It is rumored that Zhang Xueliang's intention is to give leniency by converting those who were arrested, who are mostly intellectuals, and were involved in lighter cases. However, among the party criminals arrested, Li Lusen was involved in major cases after several interrogations, and he is suspected of being the alter ego of the famous communist leader Ding Junyang. Previously, detective team members had been sent to Shandong to investigate (because the Shandong Provincial Government had Ding's files). Now the member has returned to Shenyang, and both the Shandong Provincial Government and the Provincial Party Headquarters have issued official letters and photos proving that Li is indeed the famous communist party member Ding Junyang, and proving that Ding is currently a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Therefore, the special court has interrogated Ding in detail to find out all the details. According to the relevant parties, the content of this case will be announced after the trial is determined.

<h3 id="e56">Panic Over Soaring Gold Prices in Shenyang <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Shenyang reports that recently gold has become valuable and silver cheap, causing a drastic change in the economy. The market price of gold notes has risen sharply while the value of silver dollars has fallen. One hundred and twenty-five yuan in Feng Piao (Feng Piao are officially valued by the government at sixty yuan to one yuan) can only be exchanged for one yuan in gold notes. Harbin dollars can be exchanged at a rate of two yuan and twenty-five cents for one yuan in gold notes. Silver dollars can be exchanged at a rate of one yuan and ninety-six cents for one yuan in gold notes. This has a direct or indirect and extremely large impact on various commercial firms and tax revenues in the province. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Residents: With the soaring price of gold, merchants selling imported goods priced in gold and Chinese goods priced in silver have taken the opportunity to raise prices. Even local products unrelated to the price of gold, such as flour, sorghum, millet, bean oil, and all daily food and supplies, have increased dramatically. Residents are suffering from the high cost of living and are now facing this difficult situation, complaining incessantly. Residents in the city, who live on Chinese territory and whose rent and daily expenses are based on Chinese currency, are only slightly affected. However, residents living in the Japanese-controlled area are greatly affected, as rent has always been very high. A typical, substandard room costs nine yuan in gold notes. Now that the price of gold has risen to more than double the value of silver dollars, each room costs the equivalent of eighteen silver dollars. Middle and lower-class families, such as small vendors and craftsmen, feel that their hard-earned silver dollars cannot afford the rent calculated in gold notes. Recently, a group of tenants jointly petitioned the landlord, asking for a slight reduction. The landlord, a Japanese person, initially refused, but after much pleading, he reduced the rent by seven fen per yuan, meaning a nine-yuan gold note rent was reduced by six jiao and three fen. Even with this reduction, the rent has still invisibly increased to such an extent. Other clothing and daily necessities, especially Japanese goods, are purchased at gold note prices, resulting in significant losses.</p>
<p>(2) Business Sector: All goods purchased by stores that are normally priced in gold notes have suffered greatly. Some stores with limited capital are temporarily unable to repay their debts to Japanese merchants. Others have suffered such heavy losses that they are insolvent and have absconded.</p>
<p>(3) Government: The severe losses suffered by businesses in various counties make it difficult for them to sustain operations, leading to an invisible shutdown. As a result, tax collection agencies have no revenue. According to sources in the Finance Department, the tax revenue of various county tax bureaus in May was mostly only 30% of the required quota, a shortfall of 70%. Concerned about performance evaluations, they have requested the Finance Department to review the situation and revise the quotas. The department is currently considering the matter.</p>
<p>(4) Press: Because there are no large-scale paper mills in the Northeast, most of the paper used is purchased from Japan and priced in gold notes, which has increased several times over. As a result, one or two businesses have closed down, while four or five are struggling to survive under financial pressure. One has shortened the length of its publications to maintain the status quo. Currently, Zhang Xueliang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast, has issued an order to the governments of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces to quickly find ways to maintain financial stability and assist businesses, strictly prohibiting the export of cash. The General Chamber of Commerce is also concerned that the difficulties faced by businesses will lead to widespread closures, and has held repeated meetings to discuss solutions and request assistance from the provincial government. Zang Shiyi, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, recently convened a meeting with the president of the Chamber of Commerce, the general manager of the official silver bureau of the three eastern provinces, and leaders in the banking industry to discuss relief measures. The following resolutions were made: (1) Appropriately reduce taxes and levies. (2) Order various banks to provide loans. The lending method is that the official bank will prepare 3 million yuan, guaranteed by the local chamber of commerce, to lend to various businesses, but not more than 500 yuan per business. At the same time, the provincial government will issue an order to the magistrates of 58 counties, including Shenyang, to work with the public security bureaus and county chambers of commerce to quickly stabilize prices in order to maintain people's livelihoods and the market.

<h3 id="e57">Baker's Report on the Shaanxi Famine <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Baker, the Director of Relief Operations for the China International Famine Relief Commission, has returned to Beijing after inspecting the famine in Shaanxi. His report states that "burial teams in Xi'an City must patrol the streets twice a day," illustrating the severity of the disaster. Baker recently sent a letter to the Shanghai office of the United China Relief Association in the United States, describing the famine in great detail. The original text is translated as follows:</p>
<p>"In the Xi'an Plain area, which is 100 miles long and averages 20-30 miles wide, the wheat and millet are in good condition. Only 5% of the area within Sanyuan County offers hope, and west of that, there is no hope at all. The new grain in Xi'an is now on the market, but the market price is still ten times higher than usual. This shows that the new grain on the market cannot lower the price of grain. The 5 million people in Shaanxi Province need 4,000 tons of grain every day. This wheat harvest will yield at most 200,000 tons, which is only enough for 50 days. Therefore, grain still needs to be imported from other provinces to make up for the shortfall. Our association (Famine Relief Commission) has transported a total of 2,000 tons of relief grain to Shaanxi, making every effort and paying transportation costs several times higher than the price of the grain to get it into Shaanxi. However, the needs of the disaster area are enormous, and our relief grain is like a drop in the ocean, unable to provide widespread relief. Currently, tens of thousands of people are relying on begging for a living, or eating rotten food, or eating at porridge kitchens. Most can barely survive the hot summer, but once winter comes or the porridge kitchens close, they will still die of starvation. These people have no land, and even if Xi'an has a good harvest, they will not be able to enjoy its benefits. They are also physically weak, unable to work, and have no chance of getting food. I have urged my colleagues to gather disaster victims begging on the streets who have no opium addiction and whose bodies are not yet weak, and to accommodate them in porridge kitchens. In the first week, they are given one jin of grain per day, and in the second week, it is increased to one and a half jin to prevent the disaster victims from dying from bloating after prolonged starvation due to excessive feeding. In the third week, they will recover their strength and can be assigned to road work, with sufficient rations provided according to their work. This will maintain their livelihood until after the autumn harvest. These disaster victims are marked with symbols for identification. After being accommodated, if they are found to be begging again or absconding with tools, they will be handed over to the authorities for severe punishment. Although we are actively engaged in famine relief in Shaanxi, a famine in Shaanxi is still feared to be unavoidable. Landlords and laborers with land to cultivate can hope to recover after the summer and autumn harvests, but disaster victims who are poor, landless, and physically weak still need relief. Moreover, because these people usually eat rotten food, they will inevitably suffer from dysentery in the summer, and even more will die in the cold winter. In short, whether to find ways to help these disaster victims regain their health or to let them languish and die in the harsh winter depends on what our conscience dictates."</p>

<h3 id="e58">Twists and Turns in the Reorganization of Merchant Organizations <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Guangzhou reports that the method for reorganizing merchant organizations throughout the province was previously determined by the Training Department of the Provincial Party Headquarters. Cheng Shaojie was appointed as the chairman of the reorganization committee of the Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, and each of the old and new federations of commerce designated thirteen members to be committee members. The first meeting was held on the 27th of last month, and it was decided to take over the old and new federations of commerce on a fixed date and draft the reorganization charter. Subsequently, Chen Mingshu, the Minister of the Training Department of the Provincial Party Headquarters, believed that the number of members of the reorganization committee was too large and that it would be inconvenient for organization and operation, and that it was slightly different from the Guangzhou merchant organization reorganization method recently instructed by the Central Committee's Municipal Party Headquarters. In order to unify the work steps, the reorganization committee was ordered to stop its progress, and its first resolution was also ordered to be cancelled. The reorganization method was re-established and renamed the Guangdong Provincial Merchant Organization Guidance Committee, designated to act on behalf of the Provincial Federation of Commerce and the Provincial Association of Commerce, and to prepare for the formal establishment of the Provincial Federation of Commerce. Except for the Provincial Association of Commerce, which had been taken over by the Party Headquarters and should be handed over, the old and new federations of commerce should be taken over by the Guidance Committee. Matters that cannot be resolved during the working period may be submitted to the Provincial Training Department for guidance, and the working time is stipulated to be four months. The expenses are raised by the old and new federations of commerce, and the number of committee members is set at nine. Three people are recommended by the old and new federations of commerce from the previous thirteen people, and another three people are added by the Party Headquarters from the former members of the Provincial Association of Commerce, making a total of nine people. The above-mentioned committee members are requested by the Provincial Training Department to be appointed by the Provincial Committee. A meeting was scheduled for the 9th of this month to convene thirteen members from the old and new federations of commerce at the Provincial Party Headquarters to elect three members from each committee as attending members. However, it was found that only four people from the new federation of commerce attended that day, which was less than the legal number, and the meeting could not be held. According to the opinions of the members of the new federation of commerce, the reorganization method was not perfect. It was said that the Provincial Association of Commerce had been ordered to close down, and the old and new federations of commerce were merged and reorganized later. Now that the reorganization is being started, the Provincial Association of Commerce itself no longer exists, so how can it be allowed for the members of the association to participate in it? Moreover, this reorganization of the Provincial Federation of Commerce is being watched by the chambers of commerce in various regions. If the members of the Provincial Association of Commerce, which has been closed, are specially allowed to be reorganization guidance committee members, once this precedent is set, the disputes in the reorganization of the chambers of commerce in various regions in the future will be unimaginable. Committee members Liang Yucai and others have already put forward their opinions requesting that the proposal to add three former members of the Provincial Association of Commerce as members of the organization guidance committee be cancelled. If the Provincial Party Headquarters must allow members of the association to be committee members, the proposal can be changed to participate in the name of the Party Headquarters so that it does not contradict the case that the Provincial Association of Commerce has been closed and avoid disputes in the reorganization of the name of the chamber of commerce in the future. Otherwise, if the chambers of commerce in various regions use the participation of the Provincial Association of Commerce in the reorganization of the Provincial Federation of Commerce as a basis, how can the disputes be easily resolved? Therefore, the election of committee members to form the Provincial Federation of Commerce Guidance Committee at the Party Headquarters on the 9th was suspended again. The Training Department of the Provincial Party Headquarters believes that there is no way to resolve it, and intends to ask the Minister of Training, Chen Mingshu, for instructions before submitting it to the Provincial Executive Committee for review.

<h3 id="e59">After the Transfer of Xiang Hanping's Troops to Chaozhou and Shantou <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Shantou reports that the 62nd Division of Xiang Hanping has been transferred to Chaozhou and Shantou to garrison. Zhang Da's brigade and Wu Jianxiong's regiment are stationed in Meixian, Li Zhenliang's regiment is stationed in Xingning in the upper reaches of the Meijiang River, and Zhang Ruigui's brigade is stationed in various coastal counties of Chaozhou and Shantou. The headquarters of the 62nd Division has been moved to Shantou. Xiang Hanping himself is recuperating in the province due to a minor illness and has not yet arrived in Shantou. After the completion of the transfer of Xiang's division, Zheng Zichun's 15th regiment of the 8th Brigade of the 61st Division arrived in Shantou on the 11th and returned to the province by Anli round. Zhang Zhiying's Fourth Independent Regiment was ordered by Chen Jitang on the 10th to return to the province. The train was extremely busy transporting troops yesterday and stopped taking passengers. The local communists in various forts of Meixian in the upper reaches of the Han River are extremely rampant. According to news from Meixian, after Zhu De and Mao Zedong retreated to Xunwu and Wuping, the local militia jointly counterattacked the county seat and recaptured it on the 6th. Chen Xuesheng, the puppet county chairman, was captured alive and shot dead by the militia in Bachih. Currently, various villages in Pingyuan are as stable as usual, and the communist soldiers followed Zhu De and Mao Zedong and fled to the border of Jiangxi in the Niudouguang and Huangshe areas. On the 7th of this month, the local communists in Shikeng, Meixian, coerced more than 1,000 women and children to surround and rob the Luo Junkeng and Ling Zeng families in Shixia, burning down more than a dozen houses, looting and killing civilians, and forcing people to join the association. The county magistrate of Meixian, upon hearing the report, has dispatched a team to search and suppress the bandits in Longhuwei. Also, on the 5th, 500 bandits from Xiyang Inner Mountain looted the Huang family in Longkeng, the hometown of Huang Chengdian, the battalion commander of the special service battalion, completely looting rice, grain, livestock, etc., and kidnapping seven Huang men and six women. Huang Chengdian immediately printed and distributed a notice to the people of Inner Mountain, limiting them to release the kidnapped people and return the rice, grain, and livestock within three days. When the bandits ignored him, Huang decided to lead a team to suppress them on the 8th. Other villages, such as the Xiong family in Pankeng and villages ten miles outside the city, are constantly harassed by bandits, and the people have moved away. Shops in the Shekeng and Changsha markets have closed down and are now guarded by troops to cut off the bandits' food supply in the mountains.</p>
<p>In Dapu County, due to the continuous transfer of troops, the communist gangs Deng Yi and Deng Yigang and others revolted again in Dachan and Mujiiao villages, causing a shock in Baihou. The Shiyun District urgently telegraphed Dapu County for help. It was found that the Deng bandits had invaded Gaobei and Shiyun districts from Lixia Dam last month, and more than 200 guns were lost by the police. This month, they invaded again from Zhongkeng to Gucun, Zuobi, and Yangmen, causing significant losses. Gucun is only five miles away from Dapu City. Dapu is surrounded by bandits, all industries have been abandoned, schools have been closed, and children have been deprived of education. Only the Sanhe and Tongren districts are relatively stable.

<p>Seven workers arrested by the Public Security Bureau for alleged involvement in a plot to disrupt factory operations</p>
<p>Workers surround police station and fire shots in protest</p>
<p>A dispatch from Qingdao reports that the six yarn factories established by the Japanese in Sifang and Cangkou last year experienced a storm that shut down production for half a year. After mediation by all parties, operations were restored. At that time, a number of workers deemed undesirable by the Japanese were laid off, and the factories resumed work. Many of these unemployed workers were sent back to their hometowns with severance pay, but many remained in Qingdao. Recently, they have been used by reactionary elements and have secretly contacted workers at the Zhongyuan Textile Mill to plot disturbances. Someone recently reported this to the Municipal Government. To be cautious, the Municipal Government secretly ordered the Industrial and Commercial Association to investigate and report back before taking action. After receiving the order, the Industrial and Commercial Association, together with police officers from the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau in Cangkou, went to investigate. According to general rumors, there was indeed such a plan. The Municipal Government then ordered the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau to send personnel, along with police officers from the First Branch of the Cangkou Public Security Bureau, to arrest the seven leading workers around midnight on the 11th and send them to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. On the morning of the 12th, the remaining workers heard the news and sent more than 200 representatives to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government to request their release. When they failed to achieve their goal, the workers immediately held an emergency meeting and claimed that police officers from the First Branch of the Police station had been present during the investigation and arrest, and that the branch was the instigator. Without clarifying the situation, they went to the Cangkou Police station en masse, surrounded it, and fired several shots into the air. The police station also took strict precautions and fired shots into the air to intimidate them. Businesses in Cangkou, unaware of the situation, rushed to close their doors. After receiving the report, the Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched a security team to suppress the situation, and the Naval Headquarters also sent marines to maintain order. Seventeen leading workers were arrested and the rest were dispersed. A storm was averted. It is reported that the workers held another meeting in the factory at 6:00 AM this morning and decided to continue working as usual. Representatives were sent to various party and government agencies to request bail for the arrested workers. The marines who were sent to Cangkou have already withdrawn to Qingdao, and a part of the security team and police officers from the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau are still maintaining order on the ground. It is still difficult to determine how this matter will be resolved. (June 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Water Measurement by the Taihu Lake Conservancy Association <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The Taihu Lake basin has flat terrain and crisscrossing rivers. The water flow situation is very complicated due to the inflow and outflow of lakes and the influence of tides from the Yangtze River. Over the years, the former Taihu Lake Conservancy Bureau and the Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Project Office have set up stations at important locations in the basin to measure water flow more than once. After the reorganization and establishment of the Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Commission, a dedicated surveying team was established to survey the flow of water from the outlet of Taihu Lake, which has been going on for more than half a year. Although considerable achievements have been made, it is still insufficient to only measure the outflow volume during the summer and autumn flood seasons. Therefore, the surveying and mapping section of the commission carefully planned and formulated a measurement method. It was decided that from the plum rain season to the end of the flood season, personnel will be dispatched to set up measurement stations at the inlets and outlets of Taihu Lake and related rivers. Recently, they have successively set off in eight teams stationed in Wuxi, Suzhou, Wujiang, Weiting, Wuxing, Jiapu, Dapu, Baidu and other places. There are nine measuring stations in total, located at Gaoqiao, Wangting in Wuxi, Hushu Pass, Likou, Mudu in Suzhou, Guajingkou, Beizha, Pingwang, Zhouxiang in Weiting, Daqiankou, Xiaomeikou in Wuxing, Jiapukou, Dapukou, Wuxikou, Baidukou, etc. Among them, there are six inlets and six outlets, and seven related rivers. In the future, the influence of Taihu Lake itself on the entire basin can be clearly understood based on the results of this measurement. Agricultural irrigation and shipping in the Taihu Lake basin are more developed than other places, which relies on the large area of ​​Taihu Lake to store water for support. However, in recent years, the issue of increasing siltation and reclaiming land from the lake has been advocated by the general public, but there is still no scientific research on the matter. The commission is aware of this, so even though the work is very complicated, it still makes efforts to organize it. In addition to sending technical personnel Lu Chuanyue, Zhuang Zemin, Lin Xiaofang, Hu Qingtao, Zhao Zuzhang, Hua Zhongwen, Zhou Rongjing, and Wang Dunren to set off separately, official letters were also sent to the governments of Wuxi, Wuxian, Wujiang, Wuxing, and Yixing counties to request local protection and assistance at any time to facilitate the progress of the survey.</p>

<p>B. Matters relating to forestry</p>
<p>(1) Implement afforestation (Reasons) Our country has many barren mountains suitable for afforestation, and the afforestation technology is simple and the required capital is easy to raise. (Methods) Afforestation must be carried out by the government and the people in a practical cooperation, so that better effect can be achieved and more forest workers can be accommodated. The outline of the methods is as follows: Regarding the government side (1) Central: The central government can carry out afforestation directly on a scale that can be large or small. However, given the current financial difficulties, it does not seem appropriate to indulge in extravagance. The practical measures that can be taken are planned as follows: 1. Expand the scope of the Central Model Forest Area, increase the budget, and establish four state-owned afforestation farms. The locations should be near the Eastern Tombs of Hebei, Xusi near Suwan, Shaochen near Huguang, and near Guangxin in Eyu. 2. In addition to the annual increase in the budget for the Central Model Forest Area, the expenses for the remaining four state-owned afforestation farms should also be paid directly by the central government. Each site should have an initial establishment fee of 25,000 yuan, and the regular and temporary fees should be an average of 20,000 yuan per month. The total cost per year is about 1 million yuan. Together with the five central model forest areas, about 7,000 workers can be accommodated. (2) Provinces: The provinces must implement a forest area system to carry out afforestation. The central government should order each province to divide into several forest areas according to the province's mountains, rivers, and natural conditions, and carry out them separately. It is decided that each province will accommodate an average of 2,000 forest workers, and the whole country will be able to accommodate 50,000 unemployed people. (3) Counties: The afforestation matters of each county shall be handled by the provincial government. It is decided that each county will accommodate an average of 100 workers, and the whole country will be able to accommodate more than 200,000 unemployed people. In addition to the above three, the central government should issue an order to all water management agencies in the country to earnestly carry out the construction of security forests, and the plan should be formulated by the competent authorities themselves. Regarding the people: (1) Promote forestry cooperatives. The harvest period of the forest industry is long, and private capital is weak, so there are many who want to step back. Forestry cooperatives should be promoted to make up for this. At the same time, afforestation incentive regulations should be formulated to encourage the domestic middle class to invest in afforestation. This will not only benefit forestry but also have an effect on solving the problem of unemployed people in our country. It is a win-win situation. (2) Implement compulsory afforestation. This section should be formulated by the central government after the forest method is announced and then the provinces should properly determine the implementation measures of compulsory afforestation according to local conditions. If it can be effectively promoted, it can also accommodate many unemployed workers.</p>
<p>(2) Create a forest police (Reasons) Everyone knows that promoting forestry must first emphasize protection policies. Therefore, the methods of advanced European and American forestry countries should be imitated to organize forest police. This can not only provide for the unemployed but also ensure the safe development of forestry. (Methods) The central government should immediately establish a forest police officer training class for a period of three or six months. A part of the students should be selected and sent by the provinces, and a part should be directly selected by the central government. After graduation, the students sent by the provinces should return to their provinces to organize the forest police. The students selected by the central government should be assigned to various state-owned afforestation farms to handle forest police matters. The required expenses are at most only 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Prepare for the establishment of forestry training institutes (Reasons) Our country's barren mountains are suitable for planting trees, but the local customs are closed and few know what forestry is. The central and provincial governments should widely establish forestry training institutes to promote forestry knowledge and accommodate a part of the unemployed people. (Methods) 1. The purpose of this training institute is to train personnel to guide on-site afforestation. In addition to teaching common sense of forestry, special attention should be paid to practice. The training period is temporarily set at half a year. 2. The training institute should be hosted by the central government, and it seems appropriate to set it up in Mount Lu, because Jiangxi is rich in forests and the location is very suitable. As for the provinces, the local situation is different, and the provinces should decide whether to set up one or multiple schools by themselves. 3. The cost of each school is two or three million yuan at most and one million yuan at least, and the organizing agency should decide by itself.</p>
<p>(4) Reward forestry product manufacturing industry (Reasons) Our country's forestry product manufacturing industry, such as charcoal, camphor, lacquer liquid, tung oil, etc., is either related to international trade or is an important consumer product in society. However, over the years, the government has not given encouragement, which has led to a decline. As a result, it is necessary to find ways to promote its development, so that on the one hand, it can accommodate a large number of workers, and on the other hand, it can develop the national economy. (Methods) 1. Formulate regulations on rewarding forestry product manufacturing. 2. Appropriately reduce the amount of tax. 3. Whenever transported by state-owned railways, the freight should be reduced appropriately. 4. The government should provide subsidies when necessary.</p>
<p>(5) Maintain the original logging company (Reasons) The logging area of ​​our country is the first in the three eastern provinces. According to recent surveys, there are more than a dozen companies in Jilin's Xingcai Huasen Changning Huangquan and Harbin's Hailin Zhongdong and Andong's Manxian Yalu River Logging Company with a capital of more than 20,000 yuan. In name, they are jointly operated by China and Japan, but in fact, they are all controlled by the Japanese. The two forestry companies, Tienun and Songjiang, which are jointly operated by our country's officials and merchants, have suffered losses for years due to the oppression of the Japanese. The impact is related to the unemployment problem of our country's people. Therefore, for the sake of the national economy and for the sake of the unemployed, the government should find ways to support them so that they can continue to develop. (Methods) 1. The central government should send personnel to thoroughly clear up the past operating conditions of the two companies. 2. Change the organization of the company. 3. Conclude a cooperative agreement with the local government. 4. The central government should pay 100,000 yuan in renovation fees.</p>
<p>The above methods regarding forestry are all based on the current situation and the practical feasibility. If they can be implemented one by one, about 300,000 workers can be accommodated. The expenses required by the central government are about 1.5 million yuan, and the expenses for the undertakings that should be handled by the provinces and counties should be the responsibility of the provinces and counties themselves.

<p>Villager Hangs Himself to Death: Zhang, wife of Jiang Xiangming, a resident of Xiang Village, District 28, Xiaokunshan area, and her son, Azhao, wanted to go out to work this month on the 8th to make a living. They discussed it with Xiangming, but he refused their request. After some argument, the mother and son still resolutely left the village. Unexpectedly, Xiangming became angry at home and hanged himself to death on the night of the 14th. After a hasty funeral, someone reported it to the county government and requested an examination. County Magistrate Jin then appointed Clerk Wang to go to the village for investigation.

<p>Stamp Tax Inspectors Extort Money: At 12:00 PM on June 8th, Tang Qi and Qian, who claimed to be stamp tax inspectors, suddenly came to Huajiaqiao Town. They arrived at the Xinxin Rice Mill, Wang Wanshun, Hengxin, and other tobacco and paper stores one after another. Without asking for any reason, they broke into the counter and rummaged through boxes, inspecting the account books one by one, and taking away a copy of the previous year's account book. They intimidated the shop owners, falsely claiming that they would be immediately fined 50, 30, and 20 yuan, respectively, under the law because the stamp tax on the account books was sufficient, or because the stamp was missing, or because the stamp was too small. The shop owners repeatedly pleaded, and they settled for 7, 5, and 2 yuan, totaling 14 yuan. After paying, the shop owners asked the officials for receipts, but found none, and realized they had been deceived. They then seized the officials and took them to the Lüzhen Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Chief Takes Office in Danyang: Zou Wusan, Chief of the Kunshan County Public Security Bureau, has been ordered by the Ministry of Civil Affairs to be transferred to Danyang County as Chief of the Public Security Bureau.

<p>Progress on Planning the Circum-Lake Highway: Zhang Jingjiang, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, believes that bandits are rampant in the areas along the lake in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and residents cannot sleep peacefully. Although the central government has sent troops to suppress them, the root causes have not been eradicated and the aftermath is worrying.

The court also ordered that three counter-revolutionaries Liu Pinzhang, Gu Zengdao, and Pan Genquan be judged innocent, except that Gu Zengdao was involved in the Tienzhuang theft case and ordered him to be sent to Fushu County for review. Pan Genquan was sentenced to 20 years in prison for robbery and has not been fully executed. Liu Pinzhang had a part in leading bandits to extort and should be handed over for trial. The High Court also ordered the county to send police to Suzhou on the 17th to bring him back.</p>

The Songxia Public Security Branch sent police to apprehend Tian Mao and Xie Shen and send them to the county government. On the 6th, Reviewing Officer Zhu went to the scene of the incident to verify the body. Since Yang Yongchao was on the run, the police were ordered to apprehend him.

The bureau sent Supervisor Qian Yu and Education Officer Zhu Shaoguang to the school to investigate and found that the entire school building was old and dilapidated and in disrepair for a long time. The injured students and school workers were sent to Fujih Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injuries were not life-threatening. However, the students' families feared that the remaining classrooms would suffer the same fate and asked for leave for their children, causing classes to be suspended for several days. It is now learned that the school, in order to avoid delaying the studies of the students, hired workers to repair the collapsed house first and resumed classes on the 14th. County Chief and Director of Education jointly sent letters to the initiators, scheduled to meet and discuss fundraising to rebuild the school.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Yueqing <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Yueqing in Deep Water and Fire: The disasters in Yueqing are unprecedented in a century. The people are suffering from hunger and cold, and unexpectedly, they are also plagued by bandits. It is the most miserable situation. The people of Hongqiao District in the county have petitioned the provincial government to report the rampant bandits and the situation is quite painful. It is briefly mentioned that Yueqing is unfortunate to have suffered this great famine year and has also encountered banditry. Over the months, the National Defense Army has been carrying out repeated rounds of suppression of mountain bandits through Hongqiao, resulting in huge supplies, and it is difficult for local public funds and merchants to borrow and manage the high prices of rice and firewood. Since the National Army was invited to suppress bandits, a total of more than 1,300 yuan in food and other expenses has been spent. The main street of Hongqiao has repeatedly solicited donations, but only received about 400 yuan. There is no way to borrow the lost amount and we are just waiting to die. It is unbearable to have this kind of state. In addition, the main street of Hongqiao must raise funds to maintain public order for the militia group, and the amount needed is huge. It is impossible to donate one donation at a time. Commerce is declining and the people are not living. What's more, the National Army occasionally passes through one or two companies, and each time it passes through and stays for one night, it is impossible to handle the provision of food for breakfast and dinner without 130 to 40 yuan, and we are waiting to die with our hands tied like this and the people are getting tired to no end, and the street citizens' minds and resources are exhausted to the point of failure. In the event of our inability to do anything, then people will each seek escape for their persons, and the state of disarray in the place will be insufferable.</p>

In addition to recording the case and ordering the finance department to implement it, it is hoped that the county's education expenses can be eased.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Retention</p>
<h3 id="e89">Luo Jialun, President of Tsinghua University <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Luo's resignation is still very firm.</p>
<p>(National News Agency) Luo Jialun, president of National Tsinghua University, suddenly submitted his resignation to the Ministry of Education on May 23. Luo has made remarkable achievements in organizing Tsinghua and its construction over the past two years, and he has always been known for his sense of responsibility. His sudden resignation has attracted great attention from those concerned about education issues. There are not many complete universities in the country, and it is regrettable that Tsinghua, which has been put back on track, has suddenly experienced twists and turns. As for the agitation of a small number of students at this time, its background is worthy of consideration. Important documents regarding this matter are presented below.</p>
<p>Luo's original resignation request: "Submitting a request for resignation due to the deteriorating academic atmosphere. I, Jialun, was appointed to head Tsinghua nearly two years ago, and have made initial progress in organizing and constructing it. In these turbulent times, I have worked hard to maintain the vitality of national education. However, on May 20, the Student Union Congress had students proposing motions related to the president's retention. On the 21st, the motion was rejected by the majority of the entire student body. Although such phenomena are commonly seen and not surprising in the present day, it is not what I, Jialun, who has devoted myself to developing and expecting the most from Tsinghua, wish to see. I think it is due to a lack of trust. Although this motion was rejected by the congress, it shows that reason is in the hearts of the people, and there are many students who understand reason and care for scholarship. Moreover, I, Jialun, was appointed by the Party and the state and am directly under the Ministry. I know where I belong. However, such phenomena cannot but be said to be a sign of the deteriorating academic atmosphere. I believe that although the academic atmosphere is deteriorating, the morale must not be lost. Therefore, I earnestly request the Ministry to approve my resignation and appoint another capable person. I am deeply grateful. During this period of resignation, all school affairs will be handled by the school affairs meeting. I submit this together for your consideration." Jiang, Minister of Education, noted: "Mr. Luo's resignation was telegraphed on May 23. After its publication, he left the school. This resignation is a moral protest, fundamentally denying students the right to participate in the president's retention. In the current environment in Beiping, it is impossible to rectify the academic atmosphere, so he has taken this decisive step of withdrawal to let them recognize this as a matter of the integrity of the educator."</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education's original telegram of retention: After receiving Mr. Luo's resignation telegram, the Ministry of Education immediately sent telegrams on the 26th to retain Mr. Luo himself and the school affairs meeting. The original text is as follows: (To Mr. Luo) "Respectfully, Mr. Luo, President of National Tsinghua University, I have received your telegram. Organizing school affairs requires perseverance. I hope you will maintain your original aspirations, endure hardships, and not consider resigning. Sincerely, the Ministry of Education." (To the School Affairs Meeting) "Respectfully, the School Affairs Meeting of National Tsinghua University, I have received your telegram. The Ministry of Education has sent a special telegram to retain President Luo. I hope you will jointly persuade him. Before President Luo resumes his duties, please maintain all school affairs for the time being. Sincerely, the Ministry of Education."</p>
<p>Luo's Resignation Is Firm: After receiving the Ministry of Education's telegram, Luo believed that rectifying the academic atmosphere was not allowed by the current environment, and he was unwilling to carry on superficially if he could not rectify it. Therefore, he left Beiping on June 7 with a very firm intention to resign, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Ministry Order to Submit Revised Books for Review <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education stipulates that all books that are approved for review after revision must be submitted for review within a limited time, and a circular is issued to the provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus for compliance. The order reads:</p>
<p>"It has been found that many publishers have not submitted the revised versions of various books 'approved for review after revision' according to previous orders issued by the Ministry. Some have even submitted them after a long delay, which has caused many drawbacks. It is now stipulated that all books 'approved for review after revision' must be submitted for review within six months from the date of issuance of the order. Those who fail to submit the revised version within the deadline will have their original approval invalidated. In addition to issuing separate orders, this order is hereby issued for compliance."</p>

<h3 id="e92">Shandong Provincial Educational Achievement Exhibition <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Communication: The Shandong Provincial Educational Achievement Exhibition, which has been in preparation for a long time, opened at 10 a.m. on the 11th at the Shandong Provincial People's Education Hall. This is the first achievement exhibition since the implementation of the Three People's Principles education in the province, and the education community attaches great importance to it. The situation is recorded below: Exhibition Items: Inside the gate of the venue, to the west, is the Health Exhibition Hall. In the center is the Revolutionary Memorial Hall. In addition to various revolutionary memorabilia, there are also various photos of the May 3rd Massacre, in which the Japanese bombarded Jinan, and photos of the May 3rd Massacre Memorial碑 established by the Education Department in various counties throughout the province, which are most striking. From here, turning northwest, the road is marked with five-color paper tied with ropes. The sales office of the People's Education Hall is located on the west side of the road, and behind it is the venue. The downstairs in the northeast corner of the venue is the first room for the exhibition of scientific achievements, and the upstairs is the second room. The rooms display various achievements in natural science, social science, and language science. To the west is the first room for the vocational achievement exhibition. The first room contains many scientific instruments, the second room contains many woven fabrics, and the third room contains many leathers. Turning south is the art achievement exhibition hall. From north to south, the fourth room contains many woven fabrics, the third room contains many calligraphy and paintings, the second room contains various seals, and the first room contains woodwork, bamboo work, leather work, plaster work, etc., with no shortage of exquisite items. Further south are the World Book Company, Commercial Press, China Book Company, and educational supplies display areas. Further south is the exit.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony: The opening ceremony was held at 10 o'clock as scheduled. He Siyuan, Director of the Education Department, presided over the meeting. Yan Qizhong and Li Xiawen were the recorders, and Zhang Yixian was the master of ceremonies. First, the chairman reported on the purpose of the opening, stating that today is the opening day of the Shandong Provincial Educational Achievement Exhibition. The province has been under the blue-white flag for two years. In the first year, due to diplomatic relations, the provincial government was located in a remote corner, and the education of the province could not be organized. In the past year, we have begun to organize and the results are not good, but relatively fast. During the Zhang Zongchang era, the province's education expenditure was only 1.3 million yuan per year, but now it has increased to 2.2 million yuan. Only with a stable economy can schools be sound and produce results for society to see. This national education conference was surprised by the speed of Shandong's education reorganization. With the exception of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong, Shandong has the most education funding of any province in the country. This is the result of the efforts of colleagues in the province's education community over the past year. It is hoped that we will continue to work hard. Education funding for the 19th year has increased to 2.82 million. The salaries of teachers at the province's first experimental primary school are higher than those of schools in Nanjing. Although several vocational schools were merged in the 19th year, 10 classes of rural teachers, 7 classes of junior high school, and 4 classes of senior high school were added. The current exhibition lacks achievements in compulsory education and rural teachers. It is now planned that by the 21st year, each large county will have a rural normal school, and every three small counties will have a rural normal school, with the rural normal school in the provincial capital as a model, and another rural normal school training class will be established to train teachers. In terms of compulsory education, Jinan and Yantai are designated as two compulsory education experimental zones. Preparatory committees have now been established. The six departments of the provincial government and the higher court will deduct 1/10 of their expenses to extract 200,000 yuan for Jinan's compulsory education expenses. There are only more than 30,000 school-age children in Jinan. It is planned to run 600 primary school classes over a two-year period, so that all children in Jinan can receive education. There is currently no compulsory education experimental zone in the country, and our province is the first to set an example. Recently, with the continuous artillery fire, all sectors have been able to maintain a calm attitude to visit and attend the meeting, and it is hoped that they will publicize it. Zhang Hanying and Qin Qirong, representatives of the Provincial Rectification Committee, and Wang Houzhi, representative of the Provincial Government, spoke as guests. Finally, Wang Shulin, Director of the Third Section of the Education Department, reported on the preparation process, stating that the exhibition is roughly divided into two major groups: education administration achievements and school achievements. The administrative achievements are limited to the Education Department and provincial schools, and the school achievements were received from 85 or 6 counties due to the current situation. All preparations and arrangements are also due to limited funds and the current situation, which is very imperfect and regrettable. A group photo was taken and the meeting adjourned. The public tour began at 1 p.m.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Recovering Concession Educational Rights <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The petition of more than 30 schools such as Minli: Chen Jicheng, the principal of Shanghai Private School's Kindergarten Normal School, Su Yingjie of Minli Middle School, Tang Naikang of Shibei Middle School, Wang Suben of Minli Girls' Middle School, Yan Yucun Middle School, Wang Zhenshen of Yucun Middle School, Ling Zushou of Nanyang Girls' Middle School, and the principals of more than 30 other schools, yesterday submitted a petition to the Municipal Education Bureau, stating: "Submitting a petition to your bureau to quickly recover the educational rights of the concessions in order to uphold national rights and value culture. All countries in the world attach importance to education, because education is closely related to culture and national destiny, and should not be neglected. Today, the education in the Shanghai concessions is not under the jurisdiction of your bureau, but is controlled by the concession authorities, who arbitrarily impose colonial education on our country. The imperialists see this as a good strategy because they harbor the ambition to invade our culture. However, what about the future of education in our country? What about the culture and national destiny of our country? The principals of these schools are pained by the deprivation of educational rights and the transformation of national character, and cannot remain silent. They dare to cry out, hoping that the director will understand the situation and quickly negotiate with the concession authorities to recover the educational rights of the concessions, and will not stop until the goal is achieved."</p>
<h3 id="e94">Declaration of the Shanghai South District Education Association <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality South District Education Association yesterday solemnly issued a declaration on the recovery of the educational rights of the Shanghai concessions (excerpt): "The educational rights of the Shanghai concessions should be completely transferred to the Shanghai Special Education Bureau for unified facilities and increased efficiency. It is absolutely unnecessary for Chinese to overstep their authority. Then, the educational administrative power can be unified, the principle of Chinese people running Chinese education can be implemented, the millions of oppressed people in the concessions can be saved, and all anti-education facts in the concessions that can affect the whole country can be eliminated. Only then can the independent spirit of our Republic of China's thought and national culture be promoted and developed." (end of excerpt)</p>

<h3 id="e95">Military Education Review of Achievements <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Labor University and Jinan University are the best.</p>
<p>The military education of Shanghai universities has been reviewed by reviewing officers. According to reports, the results of this review showed that the achievements of the Agricultural College of Labor University were the best. The students of the college were divided into three classes, which were organized into one platoon according to the classes. The class leaders and platoon leaders were all students. During the drill, the company was coached by instructor Teng Qi. All students were able to accurately obey the commands of the instructor and class leaders. The movements were swift and orderly, and a courageous spirit was full of the spirit of fighting the enemy. The most commendable thing was that the students listened quietly to the remarks after the exercise for more than an hour without coughing and without fatigue. This kind of obedience is really hard to come by in schools and can be said to have a military spirit. The other schools may have neat steps but lack flexible movements, or they may have strict discipline but lack enthusiasm. They still cannot understand the meaning of commands and orders, so the movements are often inaccurate and cannot meet the requirements of the exercises and show their spirit of fighting the enemy. However, the rain drill at Jinan University shows a spirit of disregard for danger. This is the result of the review in terms of technical subjects. There are other aspects, such as the attitude of listening to lectures, the methods of teaching by instructors, etc., which have their own advantages, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e103">International University Games <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>August 7 to August 26</p>
<p>Held in Germany, with participants from 12 countries</p>
<p>Eligibility limited to students under 27 years old</p>
<p>Japan will depart tomorrow; Chinese soccer may as well attend.</p>
<p>The fourth International University Athletics Competition will be held in Darmstadt, Germany, from August 7 this year. The venue is the sports field of the city's Industrial University, and the event is organized by the International Student Federation, which has already begun preparing everything. Participants include England, Germany, Japan, France, Italy, Belgium, Hungary, Egypt, Estonia, Switzerland, Romania, and Yugoslavia. Recently, Norway, Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Denmark, and Austria have also registered to participate. The chairman of the conference is Mr. Grudius, the German Foreign Minister, and the president is Dr. Olan, the president of the Industrial University. The chairman of the General Affairs Committee is currently determined to be Mr. Soling Geru, the physical education instructor of the Industrial University. The consultant of the conference is currently undertaking the task of Mayor Darmstadt Standard. The various departments of the competition are managed by the German Sports Association, and the chief referee is Mr. Baldo, who led the athletes to the East last year and participated in the China-Japan-Germany sports meet held in Liaoning. The conference will last for a total of ten days, from August 10 to August 26. At the same time, the city will also hold a 600th-anniversary celebration. Students from the Industrial University and other schools will hold lantern parades and concerts every night, and a grand fireworks display will be held on the banks of the Sezuka River to express their welcome to the international athletes. The Zeppellin airship will be dispatched to the city to provide sightseeing tours for the athletes from various countries. All preparatory matters are now in full swing. The eligibility for participating athletes is limited to university students under the age of 27. The competition events include track and field, swimming, netball, volleyball, soccer, baseball, and rowing. If it is winter, ice skating and skiing will be added. The conference is held every two years. The first was held in Warsaw in 1924, the second in Rome in 1926, and the third in Paris in 1928. In the last session, Germany won the championship with 157 points, France won the second place with 88 points, and England ranked third. Japan will officially send athletes to participate in this conference. England and France fear that they will be surpassed by Japan, because Japan's amazing achievements in the Far East have been shocking to Europe and the West. Japan has hopes of winning the second place in this international conference. Japan ranks second in the world in swimming and baseball. Japan ranks first in the world in women's track and field. In men's track and field, Yoshioka's 10.8 seconds in the 100 meters, 21.5 seconds in the 200 meters, Nakajima's 49 seconds in the 400 meters, Iwanaga's 15 seconds in the high jump, Sumiyoshi's Ito's 62 meters in the javelin, Oda's 7 meters in the long jump, and Nishida's 4.15 meters in the pole vault are all expected to be selected in the conference. Japan's entire team of athletes is about 100 people and is scheduled to depart from Tokyo on June 18, pass through Korea and the three northeastern provinces, and take the Trans-Siberian train to arrive in Darmstadt on August 2.</p>
<p>Since the eligibility for participating athletes is limited to students under the age of 27, if our country's university soccer team can be mixed into a strong lineup, it is not impossible to try to compete for the International Student Championship.</p>

<p>(Dentsu Tokyo, 16th) The Japanese team of seven athletes to be sent to the Third International Student Athletics Championship, held in Darmstadt, Germany, from August 7th to 11th, is scheduled to depart on the 18th. The European Expedition Selection Committee of the Japanese Student Athletics Federation places great expectations on this tournament as a test of strength against the Lausanne International Games. Staff and athletes are doing their best, but fundraising is very difficult. In addition, sending four more athletes to fill vacancies requires even more funds. Various parties continue to work hard to raise funds. Dr. Yamamoto, the team leader, and his wife are raising donations everywhere. Early graduates of Waseda University are each contributing ten yuan. Ms. Nikaido, the principal of Nikaido Gymnastics School, is also economizing on expenses and donating 300 yuan. The College of Arts and Sciences and Saitama Normal School are also raising donations everywhere. Furthermore, because the Japanese Student Athletics Federation previously excluded Keio athletes, the dispatch of athletes this time was severely affected. The subsequent persuasion of Keio athletes to participate was rejected by Keio athletes, making it impossible to raise donations from the Keio system.</p>

<p>Team members depart for China tomorrow</p>
<p>(Special Japanese Correspondence) The Meiji University tennis team, which is about to embark on an expedition to Hong Kong and Shanghai, has decided to depart from Yokohama on the Asama Maru on the 16th. The strength of this team is strong and it belongs to the top selections among universities in Japan. Judging from the Kanto Student Tennis Association competition currently underway, Matsuo defeated Kawachi (Waseda) 5-7, 6-4, 11-9. This person won the Kanto branch singles champion in early May. At that time, brother Fujikura was his opponent in the finals, and although brother Fujikura lost to Sato Jiro, the Far East representative, 6-3, 2-6, 6-8, 1-6, it is worth noting that he was able to seize a set from the ever-victorious general. Unfortunately, Matsuo lost to Ikuchi of Keio 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 5-7 after a five-set fierce battle. As for the doubles results, although they were worse, they were defeated by the strongest in Japan during the semi-finals, which was not a crime of war. See the scores on the left.</p>
<p>Fujikura and younger brother (Meiji) vs. Yamaoka and Ka (Waseda) 3-6, 5-7, 4-6 loss</p>
<p>Matsuo and Aira (Meiji) vs. Yamagishi and Shimura (Keio) 3-6, 4-6, 8-10 loss</p>
<p>Okamoto and Komatsu (Meiji) vs. Fuji and Sagawa (Waseda) 0-6, 2-6, 3-6 loss</p>
<p>The Yamaoka team that defeated the Fujikura brothers actually broke the Yamagishi and Shimura, the Far East representatives, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4, in the semi-finals. From this, it can be seen that the waves in the Japanese tennis world are overlapping, and at the same time it proves that Meiji's strength is not weak.</p>

<p>Dentsu, Prague, 14th The semi-final of the Davis Cup European Zone tennis match between Japan and Czechoslovakia, the first day of singles matches, was held here today. The match between Japanese player Harada and Czechoslovak player Menzel became a white-hot battle from the beginning. The first set went to twenty-four games, with Harada finally defeating the enemy. However, the second, third, and fourth sets were lost to Menzel. The result was a 3-1 victory for Menzel.</p>
<p>Menzel 9, 11, 6, 3, 7, 5, 6, 1 Harada</p>
<p>This match continued for more than three hours. Harada was too strenuous in the first set, which caused him to show a little fatigue. It is a pity that he made mistakes in succession. Next was Ota against Koselge. The first and second sets were won by each other. Ota won the third set 6-4. Because the day was already dark, it was suspended and postponed to the 15th for resumption. As of the third set, the scores of both parties are as follows</p>
<p>Ota 6, 4, 4, 6, 6, 4 Koselge</p>

<p>The National Sports Association of China, organized by the National Sports Association of China, has been in charge of national sports administration for many years. In addition to being registered with the Beijing government, it also requested registration with the current government early on. However, due to the many national events in recent years, it was not formally approved until May 3 of this year, when it was approved by the Ministry of Interior. The original approval is recorded as follows: Ministry of Interior Approval Jingzi No. 94. The original submitter, the National Sports Association of China, submitted a document to submit the association's charter for record.

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 p.m., the Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team and the Healthy Tongzi Basketball Team held a friendly match at the Public Sports Field in the city. The Liangjiang team's skills have improved rapidly, and its reputation has been greatly enhanced since its victory over the Guangdong Women's Teachers College. It is becoming a force to be reckoned with in the Central Plains. However, this match used men's rules, making it difficult to show its strengths and was restricted by the opponent everywhere. In the first half, the Healthy team's passing and attacks were lively and unusual, and the shots into the basket were almost like a cannon of beads. Liangjiang tried its best to deal with it and only made one goal by Long Jingxiong. The score was 22-2. In the second half, Liangjiang replaced its players and the momentum was weaker. Another 24 points were added, for a total of 46-2. Healthy won.</p>

<p>An unprecedented major change in foreign exchange occurred again yesterday. The shilling quotation was first reduced by one penny to one shilling and five pennies. The 25th exchange rate suddenly rose by 7.875 cents, calculated as one tael, four mace, one tael, four mace and one cent, seven-five. The US exchange rate fell by two yuan to only 34.75 yuan. The exchange opened yesterday morning at 592.5 taels, reached a high of 603.2 taels in the afternoon, and closed at 598.8 taels. The Dahang Gold Shop's jewelry was 83.5 yuan, and the market rose sharply in panic.</p>
<h3 id="e117">People's Food is Becoming Increasingly Difficult <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Rice Flour and Wheat Prices Rise Together</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Seeks to Level Prices</p>
<p>Recently, the price of wheat flour has been increasing day by day. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau believes that the new wheat has been released on the market, and the price should have fallen. Such an abnormal situation, even if there is a relationship between gold prices, should not be so obvious. It is evident that unscrupulous merchants are disregarding government orders and manipulating food for profit. Yesterday, it was heard that the Bureau sent personnel to the Flour and Miscellaneous Grain Exchanges to investigate. It was found that although the Flour Exchange had decided to increase the evidence money and set a deadline for short delivery, the Bureau's committee believed that there was still room for discretionary increases. On the one hand, it also ordered the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange to do the same. The flour bulls this time were Shunfeng and Qingchangxin, two brokers who bought nearly 60,000 bags in the near term by the 14th, and even more in the long term, which was indeed suspected of manipulation.</p>
<p>Moreover, the rice price in the city, since the Social Affairs Bureau approved the relaxation of the maximum rice price limit of one yuan, was originally a temporary measure. Once the milling loss is reduced, it should be restored to below twenty yuan. However, according to reports, a small number of rice boats are secretly sabotaging the situation, and rice shops are also voluntarily posting prices in order not to be exposed. The Social Affairs Bureau believes that both the truth and falsehood should be thoroughly investigated and immediately summoned a certain Jin, an employee of the Changshu Rice Merchants Association stationed in Shanghai, to the bureau to add a warning and order him to investigate and report the matter truthfully without concealing it. In addition, from tomorrow, all prices for Changshu boats and trading shops should be reported to the Bureau by the Association on a daily basis. It was also found that a certain Yan, a large merchant in the South City, offered a price of 19.6 yuan for the rice from Tongli that he sold, which was also obviously exceeding the limited price of medium-quality rice. He was first ordered to reply clearly and then investigated.</p>

<p>Hu Ruoyu's Talk</p>
<p>Northeast representative Hu Ruoyu, along with Central Committee member Li Shizeng, arrived in Shanghai at 3:30 p.m. yesterday aboard the Fengtian Maru. After Hu and Li, along with Nie from the Peiping Agricultural and Industrial Bank who came with them, disembarked, they went to Li's residence on Fookaisin Road. At 5:00 p.m., a reporter from the Kwomin News Agency visited Hu and Li. Mr. Li was out on official business and was not met. Mr. Hu happened to be sending Mayor Zhang out, and he was met after being invited. According to reports, the mission to the South this time was because the birthday of Zhang Hanqing, the Commander of the Northeast, was heavily celebrated by dignitaries in the capital. He was tasked by Commander Zhang to come south to thank them. Furthermore, because his illness had not fully recovered, he would stay in Shanghai for recuperation and treatment. He would have to wait until he recovered from his illness before he could take up the position of Vice Minister of Health. Because he would have to work hard on his mission after taking office, he would have to fully rest in order to restore his health. As for Commander Zhang's eagerness for peace in the current situation, he is extremely willing to mediate so that weapons of war can be turned into jade and silk, and jointly develop the country. Because he has no important mission, there is no need to meet with Chairman Chiang for the time being. In the future, he may be summoned to meet at any time.</p>

<p>The Likin Abolition Committee</p>
<h3 id="e120">Progress of the Third Preparatory Meeting <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Representatives from Five Provinces Have Registered</p>
<p>The Provinces Are Requesting Subsidies from the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance commissioned Counselor Li Jihong to come to Shanghai to preside over the National Likin Abolition Conference, the preparatory meeting has been held three times. Jia Shiyi, Director of the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration, both came to Shanghai to attend. A reporter from the Continental Society visited a certain official who participated in the meeting yesterday and asked about the results of the meeting. According to him, there were more than ten representatives from provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hubei who attended the third preparatory meeting in Shanghai. All submitted various plans and opinions. Chairman Li Jihong used the method of discussing province by province to first present the contents of one province, including the current likin situation, the annual unified tax table, the steps to abolish likin, the plan to replace likin, and the special circumstances of each province. After detailed discussion, the opinions of the provinces were collectively viewed. The replacement tax after the abolition of likin can only offset a part of the current likin. The provinces are requesting subsidies from the Ministry of Finance for the funds that are insufficient for government expenditure. The Ministry of Finance cannot fully accept this point, nor can it completely reject it. It can only examine the tax revenue situation of each province to seek a legal replacement. When it is unavoidable, it can only be maintained internally and externally, and the Ministry of Finance will give discretionary subsidies to serve as a transition after the abolition of likin. Other methods will be formulated to jointly maintain the tax revenue and government expenditure of a province. The matter must be satisfactorily resolved. The formal date of the conference must be postponed until all the representatives from the provinces have gathered. A fourth preparatory meeting will have to be held before the conference. The date of the conference will be determined by the meeting.</p>
<p>Internal and External Debt</p>
<h3 id="e121">No Definite Date for the Reorganization Meeting <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The National Government has long formulated a concrete plan for the reorganization of internal and external debt, and the Ministry of Finance has long been determined to do this. However, due to internal and external political relations, it has not been possible to formally convene a meeting of Chinese and foreign committee members. There are rumors that a meeting is scheduled to be held. According to an employee of Minister Song's office, the officials of the Ministry of Finance in charge of this matter have been stationed in Nanking and Shanghai to actively prepare. Sometimes there are meetings to discuss the reorganization plan, but they are all internal daily administration of the Ministry. As for the formal meeting, it has not been possible to determine it for the time being because the military situation has not been settled.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Problem of Recovering Telephone Concessions <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Tax Association Sent Letter to Edward Yesterday</p>
<p>Chen Shiguang Will Meet with Consular Leaders</p>
<p>The Shanghai Renters' Association of Chinese Taxpayers sent a letter to Mr. Edward, the General Manager of the Public Concession Board, yesterday. The letter said: "The lack of speed and efficiency of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company has long been well known to your Board, and the company itself is aware of its shortcomings. Therefore, recently, it has been proceeding with the sale and connection to other companies. However, telephone is a public utility and is related to transportation everywhere. The convenience of transportation cannot be completed if the management and system of telephones in one place are not the same as in other places. From the perspective of the world, telephone services are mostly operated by the state and municipalities. Our country adopts the state-run method, then the franchised telephone business should be acquired and managed by our government, so that the use of telephones is extensive and the benefits of being accessible everywhere are received. Moreover, since the company is in the process of selling, in order to respect Our national sovereignty, Your Board will certainly assist in transferring the franchise right of telephones in the concession to Our government. Please note and show your willingness to assist."</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to seriously negotiate with the envoys of the United Kingdom and France on the recovery of the telephone concession. In addition to issuing a declaration, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also sent a telegram to the envoys of the United Kingdom and France, ordering the British and French consuls stationed in Shanghai to negotiate with personnel appointed by the Ministry of Communications to discuss the recovery methods. Chen Shiguang and Liu Yunfang, the two directors of the External Affairs Office stationed in Shanghai, were ordered to send a letter to the consular leaders to seriously negotiate. According to Director Chen Shiguang, Minister Wai ordered him to first consult with Mr. Ke Yinhan, the American Consul General who led the meeting, and exchange opinions. There was no order to send a letter to negotiate. He is now preparing to visit the consular leaders. Once he has met and discussed, he will present it to the External Affairs Office for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Impact of Gold Market on the Shipping Industry <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Few Passengers and Goods</p>
<p>In recent years, because of the fierce competition in the shipping industry among the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, all countries have gone all out to compete for shipping rights. As a result, there are dozens of foreign ships sailing on the Shanghai, Hong Kong, Japan, and American routes. Japan has put in the most effort. There are as many as six foreign ships regularly traveling and sailing by the Nippon Yusen Kaisha alone. At that time, the Pacific route war attracted the attention of countries around the world. Unfortunately, recently, due to the soaring price of gold and the disastrous fall in the exchange rate, all industries have been greatly affected. At the same time, import and export business has plummeted, resulting in no goods for ships to carry and making it impossible to maintain operations. The Board of Directors of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha has decided that, in order to remedy the current difficulties, the Tientsin Maru will be temporarily suspended. If there is no change next month, the Chunyo Maru, etc., will be suspended one after another to reduce losses. The Tientsin Maru arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday, stayed for only two hours, and then set sail for Yokohama to suspend operations. In addition, several foreign companies from the United Kingdom, the United States, and France will also suspend operations within the month. This kind of decline is unprecedented in the shipping industry.</p>

Mr. Fu is scheduled to take the night train to the capital on the 22nd to continue negotiations on the China-Turkey Trade Treaty. The office has already notified the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' General Affairs Department. In addition, the Turkish Embassy originally operated at 191 Jupp Lai Road. Because the office space was insufficient, it plans to move to the former site of the Diplomacy Discussion Association on Xiafei Road after the autumn cools down. At the same time, the Diplomacy Discussion Association and the Information Branch will move into the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office to save expenses.</p>

<p>According to the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai, the U.S. Embassy in China is establishing an office in the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai because the U.S. Envoy and the National Government are constantly in contact with official affairs and must have an office in Shanghai to facilitate contact. The embassy has applied to the U.S. government to establish an embassy office within the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai and to have embassy staff permanently stationed in Shanghai to facilitate contact. As for the rumor that the U.S. Embassy is about to move to Shanghai, it has not yet been confirmed or may have been misreported due to the establishment of an office.</p>

<p>Report on Last Year's Business Performance</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Jinpu Railway held its annual regular meeting yesterday (the 16th) at 3:00 PM in the Railway Administration Office, in accordance with the loan contract. The meeting included a report on the previous year's business performance and discussions on various future issues. According to regulations, three representatives from the Anglo-Chinese Corporation and Liu Weichi, Director, and Luo, Section Chief, from the railway side attended. Director Liu, as chairman, first reported that both passenger and freight traffic on the railway had increased significantly during the 18th year, especially passenger traffic. As a result, the net profit for the past year was higher than ever before, which was gratifying. However, while revenue had increased, expenses for employee salaries and urgent infrastructure construction were also substantial. The sharp rise in gold prices this year had a significant impact on the railway's foreign orders for locomotives and materials, as well as on loan repayments and interest payments. Therefore, greater efforts were needed to further develop the railway's business. Liu also reported that the vehicles ordered from abroad last year had been arriving successively, and that the train operation situation would be improved and the travel time between Jinan and Shanghai would be shortened once all the locomotives arrived, in order to improve efficiency. Regarding rumors that the railway planned to use the Boxer Indemnity to purchase 18 locomotives from foreign countries, he stated that this was absolutely not true.</p>
<p>China Aviation Transport Company</p>
<h3 id="e131">Negotiations on Amending the Contract <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>New Contract Expected to be Signed Next Week</p>
<p>It has been reported in the newspapers that Sun Ke, the Minister of Railways, previously formed the China Aviation Transport Company with American businessmen to fly daily between Shanghai and Wuhan. However, the contract was quite unfavorable to the Chinese side, and the China Aviation Transport Company was transferred to the Ministry of Communications. Wang Boqun, the Minister of Communications, immediately sent representatives to negotiate with the American representatives in Beijing to amend the contract. This matter has been quiet recently, but according to sources from the Ministry of Communications yesterday, negotiations are still underway in Beijing. A large part of the new contract has been finalized. The content stipulates a capital of three thousand</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>ten thousand yuan, with the Chinese side accounting for 55% and the American side accounting for 45%. Future personnel, administration, and the establishment of the board of directors will be based on this ratio. The company will be reorganized according to Chinese company regulations. As for the bonds paid monthly by the Chinese side to the American side due to the constraints of the previous contract, this was the most contentious point in the negotiations between the two sides. The American side has repeatedly changed its representatives for this reason. The two sides have now agreed in principle that the bonds paid by the Chinese side will be used as the Chinese side's new capital, and the bonds received by the American side will also be used as the American side's capital, or they will be offset against each other. One of these methods will be chosen in the future. According to Minister Wang, the new contract is expected to be signed next week and will be announced after being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Japanese Traveling Students Cause Trouble in Suzhou <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Eighty-one students from Fukuoka, Japan, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Led by teachers Fujishima and others, they went to Beijing for sightseeing. The day before yesterday (the 15th), they returned to Shanghai and got off in Suzhou to visit the scenery. A conflict arose with wounded soldiers over the competition for donkeys, leading to a mutual brawl. Several soldiers and Japanese students were injured, two of the Japanese students more seriously. Fortunately, the Public Security Bureau protected them and escorted them to safety. Yesterday, the tour group returned to Shanghai one after another. The plan to visit Hangzhou was cancelled for the sake of caution. Afterwards, Kawanami, the Japanese Consul in Suzhou, reported to the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, which dispatched Deputy Consul Tanaka to Suzhou to investigate the truth. As the incident was due to a misunderstanding between the two sides, a report has been submitted to Ambassador Shigemitsu Kuri for review. However, at this time of unrest, it is inconvenient for foreigners to travel in the interior in groups without notifying the local authorities in advance for approval. Therefore, the Japanese Consulate has notified the country to pay close attention to visiting tour groups coming to China in the future.</p>

<p>Request Denied</p>
<p>Resolution to Strike</p>
<p>The French Business Water and Electricity Association's Mechanical Department (excluding the Vehicle Department) has a total of more than 700 workers. Some time ago, they submitted six requests to the factory: "(1) Retirement and bereavement benefits must be handled according to the Commercial Press Workers' Union method. (2) Working hours are eight hours per day. (3) Please issue public concession tram passes to the company. (4) The wages of all standing committee members of the department's union shall be paid if they cannot come to the factory to work due to union affairs. (5) Each person should receive an increase of eight yuan in wages. (6) A double salary should be given at the end of each year." Unexpectedly, the factory immediately issued a notice completely rejecting the requests. The workers convened a general meeting again on the 14th (Saturday) and unanimously decided to make a third plea to the management. Unexpectedly, the factory continued to issue a notice yesterday, the wording was firm and there was no room for negotiation. Upon hearing this, all the workers were extremely indignant and decided to go on strike unanimously on the 18th (Wednesday) in the hope that the factory would realize its error soon.</p>

<p>The report in the previous newspaper indicated that the leaf workers in the new and old Anglo-American Tobacco Factories in Pudong were provoked to work slowly because the factory changed its working conditions, making it difficult to maintain their livelihoods. It is now learned that the leaf workers in the new and old factories are still continuing to work slowly. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, the union suddenly received a letter from Zhang Wuqin, the Director of the Third District of the Public Security Bureau, informing them that the Second Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau would convene labor and management at the bureau at 2:00 PM today to mediate. The union immediately reported to the higher authorities and sent representatives Chen Peide, Ye Huibing, Gu Ruofeng, and Zhou Funong from the Municipal Party Department, Qiu Peihao from the Bureau of Social Affairs, and Zhao Bi from the Fifth District Party Department to attend on time. Unexpectedly, no one from the management was present until 4:00 PM. The representatives returned disappointed. It is said that the Bureau of Social Affairs will take a second step in mediation tomorrow.</p>

<p>Hunanese Ships Withdrawn to Shanghai after Headquarters Announced the Blockade of the Xiangjiang River Estuary and the Ban on Commercial Ships Entering Changsha, the Xiang'e lines of the Six Companies Complied and Suspended Service. The Changsha-bound ships of the British firm Butterfield &amp; Swire, the Xiangtan, and Jardine Matheson's Jianghe, were ordered to withdraw and travel east to Shanghai, rerouting to Wuhan-Yichang routes. The Hunanese ships have all arrived here yesterday.</p>
<p>Daye is Open to Shipping. In the past few days, the Japanese Navy dispatched three warships to Daye and transferred a merchant ship carrying Japanese residents, unnecessarily creating panic. Yesterday, however, the shipping companies in Shanghai received a telegram from Wuhan saying that Daye has been safe for commercial shipping since the 15th, and all Japanese warships have also returned to Hankou.</p>
<p>Shanghai Shipping Merchants Oppose the Anqing Pier Issue. The report on the establishment of a public lighter in Anqing to accommodate foreign merchant ships has been chronicled in this newspaper. It is now known that the Anhui Provincial Government sent document No. 2831 to Shanghai yesterday, stating that the External Affairs Department inspector, Li Fang, had reported that foreign ships traveling to Anhui did not have a lighter to load and unload passengers, posing a great danger. The provincial government or municipal preparatory office was raising funds to set up a public lighter on the river bank in a suitable location to facilitate travel (omitted). It was noted that Anqing is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and is the capital of Anhui Province. Currently, only the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Ningbo Shaoxing Steam Navigation Company have old lighters, and there are no other piers. Travel transportation is dangerous and difficult. The provincial government's plan to set up a public lighter is purely to meet the needs of facilitating travel and developing the shipping industry, and is not necessarily intended to attract foreign ships. Whether or not foreign ships will be allowed to dock after the facilities are completed will depend on the needs of the time. The authority remains in our hands, and there will be no loss to the country's shipping rights. The local people do not understand the truth and are making unfounded speculations, causing alarm. Therefore, to oppose the provincial government, they only know how to seek convenience for local transportation, and their patriotic hearts are not behind anyone in maintaining shipping rights. If we must abandon something because of a minor setback, then what is the meaning of political tutelage and construction (omitted).</p>

<p>The ship quarantine station at Wusongkou has always been managed by the Jianghai Customs, which dispatched Western doctors to be stationed in Wusong to handle the matter. After investigation by the Ministry of Health, it was found that the quarantine station should be affiliated with the Ministry of Health and staffed by personnel dispatched by the Ministry. In order to unify authority, the Ministry dispatched Technical Supervisor Wu Liande to discuss the takeover procedures with the Inspector General of Customs. It has now been agreed that the takeover will be implemented by the Ministry of Health on July 1st.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that the agricultural areas of this city are often hit by rice stem borers, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has launched publicity and guidance to encourage farmers to work together to eliminate rice stem borers in order to prevent disasters. Yesterday, a rice stem borer eradication meeting was convened in Meilong. Wang Shuji and Fan Ming, agricultural guidance officials from the Bureau of Social Affairs, Yang Xinzheng, a municipal commissioner, Wu Xiqin, a director from the Agricultural Cooperative Test Station, and more than 60 farmers from various tu and bao attended. The meeting started at 2:00 PM.

<h3 id="e138">Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway's Appeal for Rice Inspection <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Predicament of Bridge No. 34</p>
<p>Recently, rice merchants from Southern Jiangsu carrying rice to Shanghai via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway route encountered troops stationed at Bridge No. 34. The rice boats were ordered to stop and inspected, with troops boarding each cabin to check. The rice merchants, eager to reach Shanghai to sell their goods, presented letters of consignment from inland rice merchants to Shanghai rice customers, requesting prompt release. However, their requests were ignored, and they were detained for a day. The rice boat of Ding Jisheng inquired about the reason for the inspection and argued with them, whereupon he was beaten and injured, and the boat was also detained for a day before being released. After the rice boats arrived in Shanghai, they reported the situation to the Southern Jiangsu Rice Merchants Association. Yesterday, the association convened a meeting of rice merchants, at which Ding Jisheng and others reported on the inspection by the troops stationed at Bridge No. 34. They were ordered to stop for inspection, and could not leave immediately after the inspection. The tide was rapid there, and when they pleaded, they were ignored and detained for half a day or a day. Therefore, boats behind them were afraid to pass through the area and mostly turned back. Now, the boatmen must wait for the inspection to be cancelled before they can carry goods. After discussions, the rice merchants decided that Bridge No. 34 was the only way for rice boats to reach Shanghai, and they did not know which department the troops stationed there belonged to. At a time when rice prices are high and the source is scarce, further inspection and delay would lead to a shortage of goods in the Shanghai market, affecting the people's food supply. Therefore, they decided to send a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to ask the authorities to instruct the troops at Bridge No. 34 to cancel the inspection of rice boats, and to advise the rice boats in Shanghai not to panic and to continue carrying goods as usual from the interior. They will also send a letter to the rice businesses in various inland ports to inform them of the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Cotton Industry Association Requests Improvement of Cotton Inspection <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cotton Industry Association petitioned the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating that it was appealing for a thorough reform of the cotton inspection office, recognizing the status of merchants and farmers, in order to alleviate the suffering of cotton merchants. It believed that the Ministry's intention in establishing the inspection office was to improve cotton production and assist in business operations. However, after the establishment of inspection bureaus in various places, years had passed without any progress. Cotton merchants in Hankou had repeatedly appealed, expressing their deep pain and shedding tears. If the Ministry did not promptly reform, it feared that cotton merchants would become fish in a dried-up rut. The association, with its related responsibilities, dared not remain silent and specially presented the following points: cotton traders, manufacturers, and foreign merchants could all directly purchase from producing areas, and farmers could also sell to manufacturers in marketing areas. Now, the inspection bureau only inspects a portion of the cotton merchants, and does not advise on cotton purchased by manufacturers themselves. For cotton merchants, it does not matter whether the cotton is sold overseas or domestically. Once the packaging factory is used, inspection begins. Fellow cotton merchants in Hankou have already spoken in detail about their suffering. It is a pity that cotton merchants have complied with the Ministry's orders to the point where they are unable to operate, but cotton production has not improved. Manufacturers reduce prices to buy low-quality goods, and farmers sell to manufacturers instead of cotton merchants, so low-quality goods can still be sold smoothly without hindrance. Only cotton merchants are left to sit and wait for death. Is this the Ministry's original intention in establishing the inspection bureau? Hankou, Ningbo, and other places are neither producing areas nor direct ports for overseas sales, so there is no need to establish inspection bureaus there. If they have already been established, then they should start by inspecting goods transported for overseas sales, and for goods transported domestically, it seems appropriate to freely request inspection in accordance with Article 3 of the Ministry's Inspection Regulations. In other words, there is no need for a certificate to report transportation to domestic ports. The restrictions on traders due to Article 4 of the Ministry's Inspection Regulations prevent them from trading, so manufacturers procure and transport cotton themselves in the producing areas. With a single order from the Ministry, the livelihood of cotton merchants is suddenly gone. Moreover, the inspection bureau has not been in operation for a year, and it is questionable whether the water content limit of 182 to 15 has already achieved considerable results. On January 1 of this year, without consideration, an order was issued to change the water content standard to 12 to 14 percent, and it is planned to change it to 11 to 13 percent on January 1 of next year. This kind of method that does not seek the root but only cares about the branches is truly frustrating and leaves us with no way to appeal. Furthermore, the soil and climate of Chinese cotton are different from those of Indian cotton, and there is also the difference between herbaceous and woody cotton. We cannot simply rely on others' superficial experience and talk about improvement. In short, improving cotton production should fundamentally be done by rectifying the producing areas, and the Ministry cannot shirk its responsibility for the difficulties of Jiangsu merchants. It is hoped that the Ministry will recognize the status of merchants and farmers, assess the inspection bureaus in various places in order, and strive for thorough reform. The lifeline of cotton merchants is dependent on this.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent letters to various industry organizations yesterday, stating that it was writing to inform them that on June 12, a case was approved by Director Xu of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau. The letter stated that the municipal government had previously entrusted the Chamber of Commerce to assist in the municipal bond issuance and agreed to convene a meeting of various industry organizations within a week to urge subscriptions. A long time had passed, and it was requested to know the situation. The matter was discussed at the 54th Standing Committee meeting of the Chamber of Commerce this month, and it was agreed that the Municipal Government had previously issued an order to convene a meeting to solicit subscriptions and had sent letters to various industry organizations to pledge subscriptions. Now, another letter should be sent to various industry organizations to undertake subscriptions separately. It was decided to send another letter to inform them, hoping that they would investigate and broadly solicit subscriptions and pay them in order to support the municipal government.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Zhu Qinglan Investigates Recent Conditions of the Shaanxi Disaster <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The tragic deaths of disaster victims in the Shaanxi disaster have been reported repeatedly in Chinese and foreign newspapers. Last winter, there was continuous heavy snow. Due to the lack of seeds, only one-tenth of the area in the province was sown with winter wheat. Subsequently, farmers mostly supplemented by planting peas. Lantian, Yaoxian, and other counties had particularly large plantings. It is now reported that the planted beans are growing an inch or so in height, and green insects are breeding rapidly. There are not enough methods to catch and kill them. They eat the bean leaves as silkworms eat mulberry leaves. In an instant, they eat everything. Wherever they pass, everything becomes withered. Disaster upon disaster can be said to be cruel. Recently, Sun Jun Weidong, the representative of the Shaanxi Relief Association stationed in Beijing and Shanghai, received a telegram from Shaanxi reporting on Zhu Qinglan's investigation of the disaster conditions in Shaanxi. The telegram is reproduced as follows: Zhu Qinglan went to Ganyang and Liquan in western Shaanxi to investigate the disaster conditions. According to the investigation, the severely affected areas in western Shaanxi are uninhabited, and the lightly affected areas have also reduced the original population by 50% to 60% or 70% to 80%. From west of Xianyang County City, passing through Liquan and Qianxian, to the boundary of Yongshou County, an area of about 200 miles wide, no wheat seedlings were seen. Relief in the disaster area should be provided simultaneously with seeds, draft cattle, and emergency relief. In addition, epidemics are prevalent in various disaster areas, and disaster victims are dying from either starvation or disease. In a village in Liquan, it was seen that a household with a total of 49 family members had already starved to death 36. Of the remaining 13, nine are sick and all suffer from epidemics. Zhu said that after returning to Tianjin, in addition to raising large sums of relief money, he plans to ask major pharmacies in Tianjin to donate 100,000 doses of plague-preventing pills, Ten Drops of Water, Lonicera and Forsythia Detoxification Pills, Forsythia Powder, and Baodan pills for distribution in Shaanxi for relief efforts.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Mitsui &amp; Co. Lacks Legal Personhood <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Million-Dollar Debt Case Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>Mitsui &amp; Co. Has Not Registered with the National Government</p>
<p>Therefore, It Cannot Obtain the Rights of a Legal Person</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhang Rongxi's Unique Insight</p>
<p>Judge Ying Shi Proposes Two Solutions</p>
<p>He Gengxing, a compradore of the hardware department of the Japanese Mitsui &amp; Co., opened Hongyu Hardware Store at No. 15 Renheli, Tianzhutang Street, in the French Concession, selling Mitsui's hardware products. Therefore, Mitsui &amp; Co. is the most affected by He Gengxing's current debt and escape. It is reported that the amount of owed goods has reached more than one million, which is a huge loss in recent years. He's whereabouts have been unknown for a month since his escape. His Hongyu business has been controlled by other creditors and the French Concession Mixed Court has ordered personnel to be dispatched for liquidation. Most of the goods owed to Mitsui &amp; Co. are guaranteed by Hong Cangting and others. Hong is also a guarantor in the contract for the sale of hardware signed with the Japanese head of Mitsui &amp; Co. The contract was established in December of the year before last for a period of one year. Last year, after the expiration, both parties agreed to continue the validity period for another year, and Hong's guarantee responsibility was extended accordingly. Now Mitsui &amp; Co. has filed a lawsuit against He in the Special District Local Court, and Hong is listed as the second defendant. Judge Ying Shi opened the court to hear three cases yesterday morning, including two cases of goods totaling tens of thousands of dollars, and the other was a case of bills. Before He fled, he successively paid Mitsui promissory notes totaling more than 39,250 taels of silver. Some of them were due, but when they were exchanged at the bank, not a penny was received. After investigation, those that were not due were all equal to waste paper. The company then filed a lawsuit requesting that He Gengxing be ordered to repay. If he cannot repay, the guarantor should be responsible. Hong, who lives at No. 102 Zhoushan Road, Hongkou, learned of the lawsuit and hired lawyer Zhang Rongxi to represent him. Other guarantors also hired lawyers to represent them. First, Okamoto, the Japanese lawyer of the plaintiff Mitsui &amp; Co., requested to publish a notice to summon He Gengxing. Then, Lawyer Zhang raised a question that had never been mentioned before, that the plaintiff was suing in the name of Mitsui &amp; Co., which means that Mitsui claimed to be a legal person, but our country's law stipulates that if one wants to obtain the rights of a legal person, one should register with the government. He wondered whether Mitsui had registered with our country's government. Lawyer Okamoto immediately replied that Mitsui had not registered, and then continued to say that all foreign companies in this port have never registered, and no such issue has been raised in Sino-foreign lawsuits in the past. It can be said to be an innovation. On this point, my lawyer should ask for a ruling first. The judge then checked Article 30 of our country's current Civil Law and handed it to the lawyer to read, and said: In the past, during the era of the Mixed Court and the Provisional Court, no one mentioned this kind of problem, so no dispute arose. Now that our country has promulgated the law, we must of course abide by it. There are two solutions to this case: (1) to complete the registration; (2) to change the name of the plaintiff and have a natural person sue. A natural person is the head or manager of the plaintiff's company. However, the registration may take a long time. In order to expedite the case and avoid delays, it would be quicker to change to a natural person to sue. Okamoto said, suppose the plaintiff follows the instruction to apply for registration with the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Commerce, will the case be suspended during this period? The judge said yes. The lawyer then asked how long the registration would take. The judge said that this was not something the court should know, but the court had now clearly indicated two solutions. If the plaintiff decides to change to sue in the name of a natural person, they only need to correct the complaint. The opposing lawyer Zhang then expressed that the qualification of a natural person is still not suitable for this case, and said that if the plaintiff can apply for registration according to law, there will be no obstacles in diplomatic terms, and it should not be delayed for long. Lawyer Okamoto then requested that the case be adjourned for seven days for consideration, and asked to see Hong Cangting's power of attorney authorizing Zhang Rongxi to handle the case. After finishing, he stood up and claimed that the seal of Hong on the power of attorney was inconsistent with the seal of Hong on the guarantee contract. This should be noted. Lawyer Zhang stated that Hong had not only one seal, although they were not the same style, but it did not matter. Judge Ying also said that this point was not a problem, and with Lawyer Zhang's reputation, he would not appear in court without being entrusted. He told Okamoto not to worry too much, and then instructed that the request for a seven-day adjournment was too short. For the sake of the plaintiff's interests, the consideration period should be extended to facilitate the collection of evidence. It was decided to reschedule the hearing to the morning of June 28, and ordered that the announcement draft for He Gengxing's publication and the public fee for selecting a special agent for him be submitted to the case for approval. Therefore, the two cases of Mitsui &amp; Co.'s lawsuit against He were also postponed to June 28 for a joint hearing due to the issue of the name of the lawsuit. According to the case of foreign companies suing Chinese people, foreign companies have been appearing in court for decades, and no one has ever expressed any objection. Now, after Zhang Rongxi's remarks, in the future, foreign merchants should sue Chinese people in the name of the head of the company. If they use the name of the company, they must first apply for registration with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government. This is indeed a further step towards foreign countries after the recovery of legal rights.</p>
<p>Favorable to the Deputy Compradore</p>
<h3 id="e150">Zhu Jixing Apprehended <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Jixing, the deputy compradore of the Banque de l'Indochine at No. 26 The Bund, Beijing Road, absconded with 150,000 taels of silver on the 21st of last month. The bank reported the case to the police. Two days later, the Chinese and Western detectives of the General Patrol Room arrested Xie Tonghou and Yu Xilin, two accountants suspected of colluding with the case, and sent them to the court for review. They were each released on a 30,000-yuan shop guarantee. The previous report has recorded the details. However, the police believed that Zhu Jixing was the main person in this case, and how could they let him escape the law? Therefore, the investigation was very strict. He was arrested by Chinese and Western detectives at Xihua Road at about 2:30 yesterday afternoon and will be sent to court for questioning this morning.</p>
<p>Jiang Jing Steamer</p>
<h3 id="e151">Passenger Suicide Case <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Claiming to be an Active-Duty Soldier</p>
<p>Returning from the Front Lines with Many Sighs</p>
<p>Disappeared in Zhenjiang Late at Night</p>
<p>Three Letters of Testament Found in the Cabin</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang Jing steamer had a tragic suicide incident in which a passenger went missing on its voyage from Shanghai to Hankou. The information obtained is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Passenger's Background: When the Jiang Jing steamer left Shanghai for work, a passenger came to the ship to buy a ticket. The young man, wearing a military uniform and only 28 years old, named Liu Dingpan, specified that he wanted to buy a single room in the first-class cabin when he boarded the ship. He didn't want to live with anyone, saying that he was from Hunan and currently held a military position in the headquarters. This time, he was going to Wuhan. The ship's waiter opened Room 6 of the large dining room for him to stay alone.</p>
<p>The Ship Moves: After the ship set sail, Liu Dingpan closed the door in Cabin 6 to write and buried himself in writing. Occasionally, when the waiter entered, he hid the book he was writing. The waiter and others did not pay attention at first. He wrote a letter in the cabin for about a day and a half. When the ship arrived in Zhenjiang and docked, the passenger began to open the cabin and leave the ship.</p>
<p>Missing Late at Night: When the ship arrived in Zhenjiang, it had to stop at the dock as usual. Liu Dingpan suddenly went out at this time, and did not instruct the waiter when he left the ship. The crew and others did not know until the next morning when the Jing steamer set off from Zhenjiang to Nanjing, and Liu Dingpan was not in the cabin. A thorough search of the entire ship was fruitless, and suddenly it was reported that he was missing.</p>
<p>Letters of Testament Discovered: The waiter went to the entrance of Cabin 6 and saw a letter of testament thrown on the ground. He picked it up and looked at it. It was thrown by the passenger Liu, saying that there were three letters in the cabin, please forward them according to the writing. The waiter went in and immediately took three letters from the table, one to the shipowner, one to the compradore, and one to the military law department of the headquarters, and one to his uncle. The letter to the shipowner said that he had recently returned from the front lines and felt that there was no hope for the future due to certain feelings, so he had the idea of ​​being tired of the world and committed suicide. The other two letters also asked to convey his regards, etc.</p>
<p>Two Letters Taken to Beijing: The shipowner and others sent this letter to the resident military police along with the remaining two letters to Beijing. Because he was an active-duty soldier, the letters were transferred to the Capital Garrison Headquarters for verification. There were no belongings in the cabin, leaving a hat, a washbasin, and six silver dollars, which he wrote to give to the waiter as a reward. Everyone expected that Liu left the ship that night and decided to jump into the Yangtze River to commit suicide when people were unprepared, but his body has not been found yet.</p>

<p>Both Are Murder Suspects</p>
<p>At about 11:00 pm the day before yesterday, Ren, the chief of the Sixth District Police Station in Caojiadu, Shanghai West, dispatched two patrol officers to Xinkangli, Xinan Hotel, on Jisi Feier Road for routine inspection of travelers. When they checked Room 3, there were two travelers who came from Hangzhou. The names written on the circulation book were completely inconsistent, and all their actions were suspicious. The patrol officers returned to the district and were reporting to the district chief for verification when the Putuo Road Police Station sent Western detective Katai and Chinese detective Li Dacheng with Meng Guopei and a package of clothes to report to the station, saying that they had just seen Meng Guopei on the way carrying a package of clothes of unknown origin and suspicious behavior. When asked where the clothes came from, Meng said that he was asked by the traveler in Room 3 of the Xinan Hotel to pick them up, so he sent them to the district for investigation. District Chief Ren immediately sent police to the hotel to arrest the two travelers. Suddenly, a Mr. Huang from Huangyan, Zhejiang, came to the station and claimed that the head of the local (Huangyan) defense team was suddenly shot and killed at the beginning of this month. Later, he received a tip that two suspects had escaped from Hangzhou to Shanghai, so he followed them to Shanghai and learned that the two suspects had been arrested by your station, so he came to report the case. After receiving the report, District Chief Ren ordered the person named Huang to recognize the two suspects and confirmed that they were indeed the murderers. After District Chief Ren questioned them separately, one confessed to the name Wang Zhongfa (also named Chen Luxiong, also named Songzhai) at the age of 36, and the other confessed to the name Gao Fusheng (also named Ding Ayun, also named Alai) at the age of 38, both from Songjiang. After obtaining the confession, District Chief Ren thought that since the two suspects were important case suspects, why was the name listed on the Xinan Hotel circulation book determined by Xu Wenan of the town? There was something suspicious about it. Later, he sent police to bring Xu Wenan to the case and sent it to the Public Security Bureau for investigation yesterday.</p>

<p>Three Men and One Woman Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>Forcibly Taking Wedding Invitations and Trying to Escape with Daughter</p>
<p>At 11:30 am yesterday, four travelers, three men and one woman, arrived at the Fuchang Hotel on Zhongxin Road, Wusong, with seven pieces of luggage. They came from Shanghai by car and booked Room 12. At 2:00 pm, the travelers suddenly wanted to take a car to Shanghai and then go to Nanjing. Dai Guosheng, a patrol officer from the Seventh District of the Public Security Bureau, learned that their behavior was suspicious and took the nearby post police to question them. They were evasive. A set of patrolman uniforms from the Hongkou Patrol Room in the concession was found in their luggage, with the number 2065. They were immediately taken to the Seventh District of the Public Security Bureau. After being questioned by District Chief Yang, one confessed to the name Shi Guangyu, from Tengxian, Shandong, who was a patrolman in the concession and has now retired. The two men, one named Wang Xiqi and one named Wang Ruizhai, are my friends. They first came from Shandong. The woman is my wife, named Mao Landi. We got married just two days ago. Now the four of us are taking the road to Nanjing to return to Shandong. According to Wang Xiqi, he is from Shandong and a friend of Shi Guangyu. Now he wants to return to Shandong with him. Wang Ruizhai's confession was the same. According to Mao Landi, she is 20 years old, her father's name is Mao Yonggao, who makes a living by rowing a boat, and lives at No. 4, Lane 4, Tongheli, Shanban Factory Bridge, Shanghai. She works in a silk factory. She married Shi Guangyu in March last year. At this point in the interrogation, District Chief Yang felt that the date of marriage confessed by the woman was inconsistent with Shi's confession, and there might be a case of abduction. He immediately ordered her father Mao Yonggao to be brought to the case for questioning. Mao confessed that the neighbor introduced him the day before yesterday and asked me to marry Landi to Shi Guangyu. I didn't agree at the time. They said that if you don't agree, we will take your daughter away. I also said that I want to rely on my daughter to live. They said that Shi will take care of you in your old age. After saying that, they asked me to write a wedding invitation. After writing it, Shi Guangyu took the wedding invitation from my pocket and forcibly snatched it. At the same time, he took my daughter away. After verifying the confession, District Chief Yang thought that the case was a criminal case and ordered it to be sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for trial.</p>

<p>Recently, thefts have occurred frequently at China Public School in Paotaiwan, Wusong, so all the students have paid close attention to it. At 1:00 pm yesterday, there were two people with Ningbo accents who looked like students. They were both in their twenties, with fair faces and very handsome outfits. One was wearing a light pink striped drill Western suit and the other was wearing a brand-new Shanghai-made light blue silk short shirt and pants, leather shoes and straw hat. Those who did not know them would recognize them as young masters of officials and would not believe that they were petty thieves. The two thieves broke into the student dormitory and stole a small handbag belonging to a student. They were seen by the student when they were leaving. Seeing that the situation was not good, the two thieves ran away together. The students chased them from all sides until they were arrested at Guanyintang. They immediately handed them over to the school's petitioner police and escorted them to the Seventh District Public Security Bureau for detention. The owner of the bag, Student Wang, did not report to the district police station because he was in class. Because the owner had not arrived, the police station could not question them and ordered the two thieves to be detained first and waited for the owner to finish class at 6:00 pm to question them. The names, ages, and origins of the two thieves will be reported tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Husband and Concubine Allowed to Sever Ties <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Aibao, a young woman from Nanxiang, is now 24 years old. Her husband, Zhang Ahu, died of illness on June 21 last year, leaving behind a three-year-old orphan girl. A widow lives in poverty. Han Yongru, the owner of the Gonghe Bamboo Cage Store on Bailinan Road, Caojiadu (also from Nanxiang, 49 years old), wanted to take her as a concubine. He hired someone to arrange a marriage and called Zhang Libo, Zhang Aibao's aunt from Nanxiang, to draw up a document to remarry Aibao to Han Yongru as a concubine, and stated in the document that Zhang Yongru would be responsible for Zhang Libo's support and funeral. This was in October last year. On May 11 this year, Zhang Aibao ran out alone because she could not bear the abuse and pleaded with lawyer Wang Xiangu to publish a statement to sever the relationship. At the same time, she also asked lawyer Wang to file a lawsuit with the local court requesting permission to sever the relationship. Her words roughly stated that after the plaintiff's husband died of illness last summer, the defendant Han Yongru made up an excuse to continue the marriage, so he took all the cage tools with him to the door. After arriving at the door, he learned that the defendant was already in his fifties and the plaintiff was only 24 years old. Even his children and daughters-in-law were older than the plaintiff. Moreover, the defendant still had a wife and did not provide food and clothing on weekdays, forcing the plaintiff to work. If she did not do it well, she would be beaten and scolded like a cow or a horse. She had no choice but to leave alone. In such a situation, it was difficult to grow old together, so she asked to sever the relationship. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhao Zhenhai specially opened the Tenth Court to hear the plaintiff Zhang Aibao's complaint and said that he requested to recover all the cage tools. (Question) Is there an inventory of the cage tools being pursued and how much are they worth? (Answer) Approximately one hundred yuan or so. The defendant Han Yongru confessed that he was 49 years old and from Nanxiang. He would not object to her severing the relationship, but we spent a total of 141 yuan on repayment and Huifang. As for all the cage tools, they are kept by his aunt. (Question) Is she a concubine? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Is there any evidence? (Answer) Yes. Then he presented a contract for the court to read. (Question) Who is Zhang Libo on the contract? (Answer) Aibao's aunt. The contract stated that I would take care of her in her old age. After the judge obtained the confession, he mediated the reconciliation in court and ordered the plaintiff to pay the defendant 30 yuan to allow the severance. Both parties expressed their willingness. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stood up and requested that the part of the cage tool pursuit be withdrawn. The judge then ordered Zhang Libo to come to the case and instructed, "Your daughter-in-law Zhang Aibao has severed the relationship with Han Yongru. The previous old-age support contract issued by Han Yongru should be invalidated." He then drew up a reconciliation record and ordered both parties to sign and leave the court.</p>

<p>She had stayed one night at the Shenzhou Hotel</p>
<p>When questioned, her answers were vague</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 10 a.m., a woman, appearing to be in her early twenties, with short-cut hair, wearing a light gray floral serge qipao, flesh-colored stockings, and high-heeled leather shoes, and looking haggard, hailed a boat at the Jinliyuan Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau at the northern end of the 16th Pier, saying she wanted to cross the river. The boatman, noticing her sorrowful expression, paid close attention. Not far from the wharf, the woman suddenly moved to the front of the boat, facing the river as if to throw herself in. The boatman stopped her. At that moment, Huabu No. 15 of the Water Police Station was patrolling nearby and witnessed the scene. He questioned her, but she burst into tears. He took her to the police station and asked her name, age, and place of origin, but she did not answer any of the questions. Finally, she took a pen and wrote on paper, "Zhu, from this province," and other words. Her handwriting was delicate, as if she had received a higher education. She then spoke fluent Mandarin, claiming that her father was a very well-known person in society and asking to be excused for not being able to tell the truth. She requested to be taken to the Huangpu Wharf immediately. As soon as she finished speaking, she suddenly asked to be taken to the North Railway Station instead, because her home was in Suzhou. The police station staff, finding her words untruthful, asked if she suffered from a mental illness. The woman then laughed through her tears. They found a hotel bill from the Shenzhou Hotel on her person, stating "Mr. Zhu stayed in room 218 on June 15th, 1 dollar and 20 cents for one day, 50 cents for Western food, and 17 cents for small expenses." Seeing a lead to follow, the head of the police station telephoned the hotel. The hotel responded that last night (the 15th), a fashionable woman did indeed bring two pieces of luggage and rented that room. She provided a luggage receipt at the time and stayed one night. She left this morning, and nothing else was known. The head of the police station then asked the woman where the luggage receipt was, and she said it had been mailed to her brother to retrieve the luggage. The head of the police station, believing that she did not want to reveal the truth and must have some unspeakable secret, ordered the detective to transfer her to the local court for disposition.</p>

Yesterday, he was brought before the French court for investigation.

Xue confessed to selling pornographic books and films privately. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Xue to three months in the Western jail to deter others, and the pornographic books were confiscated.</p>

<p>Lin Jingluo, a Cantonese employee of the Xinfeng Wine Shop at No. 9, 17th Pier, Guangzhou, Guangdong, was ordered last year by the shop owner to bring 100 jars of wine worth 2,000 yuan to Shanghai for sale. After Lin sold the wine and obtained the money, he did not remit it back to the shop but instead spent it with Zhu Hanzhen, a prostitute at No. 603, Renzhi Lane, North Sichuan Road. Before long, he ran out of money and had no face to return to his hometown. Yesterday morning at around half past midnight, he attempted suicide by poisoning himself. The brothel owner discovered him and sent him to the hospital, but he had taken too much poison and died. The Hongkou police station dispatched Huabu No. 144 to send Lin's body to the forensic examination office on Fei Lun Road. Yesterday morning, Xu, the prosecutor from the Special District Court, arrived at the office to verify the cause of death. Zhu Hanzhen stated that she was a prostitute from Guangdong, 18 years old, working at No. 630, North Sichuan Road, and that she had known the deceased for some time. He came to her house and poisoned himself, but she knew nothing about it. However, when the deceased came to her house, he said he had been beaten on North Jiangxi Road. Liang Yiwen stated that he was the manager of the Xinfeng Wine Shop, 52 years old, and that the deceased had no family. He would take possession of the body. Prosecutor Xu approved this and ordered the body to be handed over to Liang Yiwen for collection and burial.</p>

<p>Axe fight ends with bloodshed</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there is a man nicknamed Old Jiangyin, who has two sons, the elder named Big Jiangyin and the younger named Little Jiangyin. Old Jiangyin used to be a boss of the Sanitation Bureau, earning a substantial monthly income. When Old Jiangyin grew old, his elder son Big Jiangyin inherited his father's business. Big Jiangyin has a wife and a concubine. His wife lives in Dafu Lane, Fumin Road, in the city, and his concubine lives outside the Great South Gate. The younger son, Little Jiangyin, has no occupation and hangs out with gangsters, extorting money for a living. He has borrowed countless times from his brother and sister-in-law. The day before yesterday, he borrowed another ten yuan from his sister-in-law. This was known by Little Coppersmith, a follower of his elder brother Big Jiangyin, who knew that Little Jiangyin had extorted twenty yuan somewhere yesterday and was now borrowing from his brother again, which was considered greedy and insatiable. He informed Big Jiangyin's wife of the situation, who then questioned Little Jiangyin. Little Jiangyin was furious and found out that Little Coppersmith had stirred up trouble. He gathered more than ten gangsters, each carrying axes and other weapons, to seek revenge on Little Coppersmith. Little Coppersmith also gathered more than ten fellow brothers to resist. Around 11 p.m. the night before last, the two sides fought each other with weapons in front of Dafu Lane. Big Jiangyin also joined the fight to help his follower against his brother. As a result, Big Jiangyin was hit in the right shoulder with an axe, with a wound about three inches deep. Little Coppersmith was also slashed in the arm, covered in blood. Two people from Little Jiangyin's side were also injured by people from Little Coppersmith's side. When the police arrived, the people on Little Jiangyin's side had already dispersed. Only Big Jiangyin and Little Coppersmith (both injured) were still there. When questioned, Big Jiangyin claimed it was a family matter and there was no need to go to the police station. Each hired a car and went to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Zhang Anxing Stone Works of Tongren Lane, Wusong Road, hired a wharf boat owned by Shen Yinsheng the other day. It was carrying 75 tons of stones on the Pujiang River, sailing north with the wind. At 11:35 a.m., it reached the vicinity of the Rihua Yarn Factory in Pudong. Due to the rising tide, it was about to turn to Puxi when the Norwegian merchant ship "Bmur" came from the north. The stone boat quickly tried to avoid it, but the ship was traveling very fast and instantly smashed the stone boat's hull. River water immediately flooded in. Because it was overloaded, even though the boatmen tried their best to return to Pudong, it was too late, and the boat and cargo sank to the bottom of the river. Fortunately, several boatmen were rescued unharmed. Currently, the Water Police Station, considering that the sunken ship's masts are high and obstruct ships entering and exiting the harbor, hired a wooden boat yesterday and anchored it at the accident site, hanging a green cloth flag to warn ships not to sail in that area to avoid danger. It is said that the ship and cargo losses amount to more than 2,300 yuan.</p>

<p>Stealing Should Be Punished</p>
<p>Private Punishment Is Also Illegal</p>
<p>The residents of Yinghua Lane on Robison Road in western Shanghai are mostly from the lower classes, and many criminals mingle among them. Han Lijiang, a Jiangbei native, is one of them. He does not engage in honest work and is prone to stealing. On the 11th of this month, Han sneaked into a construction site on nearby Haifang Road and stole firewood. Wang Caifu and Lu Er, the gatekeepers, discovered this and dragged him back into the construction site, tied him up, and whipped him until he was covered in injuries and barely breathing. They then released him. Han, seriously injured, tried to return home, but collapsed on Binlang Road. Around noon last Saturday, a patrolman from the Gordon Road Police Station passed by and saw that he had been dead for some time. He reported to the head of the police station, who ordered a detective to carry the body to the forensic examination office on Fei Lun Road and investigate the situation. Wang and Lu were arrested. Yesterday morning, the Special District Court commissioned Prosecutor Xu to come to the office to verify the case. Han Zhangshi, the deceased's mother, who is over sixty-seven years old, arrived and claimed that her son was murdered by Wang and Lu and requested justice.

The location for delivering the money was arranged at the intersection of Dagu Road and Longmen Road, next to the racetrack. The money was to be placed on the edge of the curb, and someone would come to retrieve it. Liu reported this to the Jing'an Temple Police Station for investigation. He first replied to the letter, stating that he was currently experiencing economic difficulties and requested a reduction in the amount, which he might be able to manage. He placed the letter on the curb at the designated location. Liu and detectives lay in ambush nearby. Sure enough, someone came to retrieve the letter, and the detectives did not disturb him. On the 14th, Liu received another letter from the extortionist, saying that the previous letter had been read and that the amount had been reduced to 1,000 yuan, which must be delivered at the same location at 11 p.m. the next night. Liu reported this to the police station again. The head of the police station dispatched detectives Lang Jintang and Wang Yongjun, as well as detective Yu Changyuan, to wait there the following night. Liu first wrapped waste paper into a package and ordered Lu Er to accompany the detectives to place the package on the edge of the curb. Only ten minutes had passed when a boy came along, picked up the paper package, put it in his arms, turned around, and was arrested by the detectives. Yesterday morning, Liu, Lu, and others were brought to the Special District Court, where Judge Wu Tingqi presided over the hearing. The boy stated that his name was Lu Qinyu, 18 years old, from Tongzhou, and that he worked as a shop assistant at the Banxintai Wood Shop at No. 223, Hankou Road. Last night, a friend named Zhou asked him to go to that location to retrieve a paper package, and he did not know what was inside when he was arrested. The police lawyer then presented the threatening letters received by Liu as evidence and requested a postponement of the hearing. Judge Wu ordered the defendant to be detained and postponed the hearing to the morning of the 20th of this month.</p>

<p>Managed by Gui Hongchang</p>
<p>The Russian red and white pine are suitable for construction factories and other factories such as organ frames and instrument factories. Because of their smooth texture, beautiful color, no knots, and ease of work, they were very popular in Shanghai in the past. Unfortunately, this product has been discontinued for many years, and users have been looking forward to it for a long time. Now, to meet the needs of society, the company has spent a lot of time and money and transported a large number of high-quality red and white pine to Shanghai. The goods have arrived in port and are exclusively managed by the Hongchang Wood Company on Guangfu Road, Zhabei.</p>

<p>Yang Yuhong Deceived into Marriage</p>
<p>Xu Amei, the Matchmaker, is Detained</p>
<p>Yang Yuhong from Wuxi, 30 years old, resides at No. 139, Guohuo Road, southern Shanghai, and works as a worker at the Qiuxin Machinery Factory. His wife, Zhou, passed away in August the year before last. Because Yang lacked someone to manage the household, he was thinking of remarrying. He met Xu Amei and Chen Wangshi, who offered to act as matchmakers. There was a Ningbo woman named Shu, 33 years old, with good looks, who was in difficult circumstances due to being alone and was planning to marry. Yang was delighted to hear this and paid 80 yuan as betrothal money. Later, he married Shu into his home. However, Shu's background was not proper, and she actually used the skills of a "white dove" to deceive people out of money. Therefore, only three days after entering the house on the 13th of this month, she took advantage of Yang's absence at work and secretly left yesterday morning, taking all the clothes and two sock machines. When Yang returned home, she was long gone, and he was extremely upset. He asked people to investigate everywhere, but there was no trace. He went to Chen Wangshi's house at No. 103, Wanghai Mound, Haichao Temple South Street, at 4 p.m., but she had already heard the news and fled. He twisted her paramour, Tang Abao, a local, and then went to Xu Amei, a matchmaker from Shaoxing, at No. 16, Sanduo Lane, and twisted her. He immediately called the guard Feng Junzhong from the 24th post of the precinct to bring them back to the Third Precinct, First District. The precinct chief, Jin, interrogated them and ordered them to be detained for investigation before further action.</p>

<p>The Health Clinic for Children of the China Child Welfare Association in Zhabei has moved from the Baptist Church to the end of Qiujiang Road in January. More than 4,000 people have benefited from it.

It has hired famous Shanghai doctors such as Dr. Niu Huisheng and Dr. Fu Wenshou to preside over medical affairs, and there are female nurses providing all-day service. Promoting health and scheduled to open on June 20th, all consultations and medications are free of charge for children.

<p>Regarding the Shi Ruiji Xin Xie Shun Housing Affair</p>
<p>The Luye Guild sends a telegram: To the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Department, the Party Departments of each district, the Municipal Government Social Bureau, the Commercial Consolidation Council, various industry associations, legal groups, and newspaper offices. Sincerely, according to a letter from our member Shi Ruiji Xin Xie Shun, a shop owner on Doushan Road, the landlord, Wen Xiao Company, sent a letter in the name of the Municipal North Inspection Office, claiming to be acting on the orders of the Municipal Government and intending to rent our shop for use as an office, and claiming to be opening a bank, repeatedly threatening and urging us to move, and saying that construction would begin after the 15th of this month. We have repeatedly pleaded, but to no avail. From then on, our business has nowhere to go and nothing to do. Therefore, we request assistance and come to ask you to take measures to stop this. Upon review, the company, etc., belongs to a small merchant. In 16 years, it was looted and burned by the Fengjun army. After that, it worked hard to operate until now. The original spirit has not recovered, and there is a sudden occurrence of mandatory rental and forced relocation, making it impossible for it to survive, which is very painful. How can today's officials bear to do this? I am afraid that there will inevitably be those who engage in economic aggression to fool and oppress small merchants to achieve their desires. The landlord is manipulated by them, so he dares to act recklessly, which not only hinders the interests of our members, but also violates the principles of the Premier's livelihood. Therefore, we specially telegraph the situation and ask you to uphold justice and provide assistance to rescue the oppressed merchants and relieve their suffering. We cannot express our anticipation and gratitude enough. We respectfully telegraph and await your high voice. Shanghai Special Municipality Luye Guild, June 15th.</p>

Yesterday, they were taken to the French court for investigation. The head of the police station first reported the situation. He Zhoushi stated that she did not know that privately setting up a brothel in the concession was illegal and asked for leniency. Chen Xiaomei, etc., admitted that soliciting customers was illegal.

<p>Mr. Yu Tiansui of Kunshan died in Shanghai. All his friends are mourning him. My sworn brother Zheng Yimei wrote an article describing his life and friendship. I also admired Mr. Tiansui. I heard that Mr. Yu abandoned his old residence and lived in Shanghai for nearly 20 years because of debt. Although he was poor and had no possessions, he was generous and righteous and often helped people in need. I heard this from Mr. Hu Shiyu a few years ago. Mr. Yu was a top student of Mr. Shiyu. Recently, I inquired about any elegiac works. He wrote and sent four elegiac poems. I was moved and recorded them in Free Talk for those who knew Mr. Tiansui to read. The zodiac sign is like a scorpion, and one's fate is sad. Selling the house to ghosts causes suffering. Living abroad is costly. The writing is extremely passionate, and life is disjointed. A haggard, homeless traveler, where will the wandering soul rest? Recalling when he went to war as a secretary. His talent moved the old poet (Jingyun had a poem about joining the army). Poetic affairs were sent with letters. Green wine stained his sleeves, and he leaned on the painted boat on the red bridge (Your poem has the line "Joining the army all day is idle, on the red bridge above the painted boat"). I can't bear to look back. The old dreams are like smoke. He was righteous and chivalrous, considering wealth lightly. He was talented in many arts (He was skilled in calligraphy, painting, seal carving, and medicine). His spirit was free. He roamed the rivers and lakes alone. He cherished old friends. Naturally, everyone sighed with regret. In the wind and rain, the rooster crowed. Many relatives and friends lamented the loss of the orphan. Home studies should be protected, lest the books be unread. Without good seedlings, bad weeds will grow. Good men will rise like reeds. Letting go ten years early is a great difficulty for the future. Alas!</p>

<p>When you first arrive, avoid unnecessary small talk with colleagues, as they will use this to test your abilities.</p>
<p>When you first arrive, do not work too hard, as excessive effort will both provoke jealousy from peers and cause dissatisfaction from superiors if you cannot sustain it.</p>
<p>Be amiable to subordinates (or those younger than you), respectful to those at your level, and courteous to superiors. Apart from fulfilling your duties, keep personal feelings at a distance.</p>
<p>If your superior asks you to do personal favors, never show an eager attitude, or someone will say you are flattering them, creating a hostile environment.</p>
<p>In your spare time, avoid excessive idle talk or commenting on any matters.</p>
<p>When chatting and laughing with colleagues, be very careful, as gossip often arises from such conversations.</p>

<p>During drinks, Yucai mentioned many ancient and modern Buddhist scriptures. Finally, he mentioned a recent incident. I was half drunk and didn't remember much, only that there was a female student who became a monk. At 6:00 PM on the 13th, Mr. Yingsheng invited me for drinks and food, and I met Yucai again. I quickly asked him for details while I was still sober and recorded them to document the strangeness. There is a monk named Yuexi who is currently in charge of the Yuantong Temple in Hongkou, Shanghai. His virtue is highly respected, and he is revered as a Vajra Master. Recently, several female students came to bow and take refuge, wishing to be accepted as disciples. The monk said, "Excellent! Buddha is mind, and mind is Buddha. All of you young ladies are studying and have responsibilities to your families and the country. I fear this is not the time for monastic life. Entering into tranquility and samadhi cannot be decided lightly on a whim." The female students all vowed that they had no other intentions and insisted on shaving their heads. The monk said again, "There is a bhikshuni (female monastic) elsewhere who is no ordinary person. If you insist, you can go to her." After the monk said this, the others were silent. One female student went straight to the kitchen. In a moment, she held out a finger to the monk and said, "Disciple has already cut off this finger." She also showed it to her companions, saying, "There is no blood under the knife." The monk then folded his hands and proclaimed the Buddha's name, also raising his hand to show the assembly that he had also cut off a whisk in the past to resolve his determination to pursue monastic life. Yucai said this much. I said, "The mantle has unexpectedly been passed on to a female Bodhisattva in Buddhism, who must be no ordinary being. But what is her name, surname, home, and school?" I hope you can tell me. Yucai said he didn't know, only that he heard that Buddhism does not allow lying. I also asked about the other students who were worshiping, but he did not know the details. Daohu brother laughed and said, "This is truly practicing One-Finger Zen!" Daohu is the intelligent son of Yingsheng, my esteemed friend, and he is especially close to Yucai.</p>
<h3 id="e193">A Bizarre Suicide Case Huang Yingdai <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the town of Chonggu, which was looted by bandits, is located north of Qingpu. A bizarre suicide case occurred near the town a few days ago. The situation is quite interesting, both sad and laughable, so I record it.</p>
<p>Beautiful Nun. There is a nunnery in a village near Chonggu. A nun named Doukou is young and beautiful, and her behavior is quite lively, with absolutely no air of a religious person. Therefore, many frivolous young men drooled over her. When they saw her go out, they followed her. The occurrence of this suicide case was probably due to the nun's beauty.</p>
<p>Raped. A few days ago, this beautiful nun went out for something. When she was returning to the nunnery, she was walking alone on a path between the fields. At that time, she suddenly encountered a rogue who saw her beauty and wanted to rape her. The nun looked around and there was no one. Even if she shouted for help, it would be ineffective. At this critical moment, she came up with a clever plan and pretended to agree to let the rogue take off her lower garments. The rogue did not suspect anything, thinking that something good would happen. Unexpectedly, the nun took the opportunity to run away. The rogue lay on the ground, got up to chase, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Borrowed Trousers. After the nun escaped from the rogue, she ran to the center of a nearby small village and finally felt a little safer. However, because her lower garments were still in the field, she felt very uncomfortable walking naked. So she entered a farmer's house to hide temporarily. A woman in the farmer's house asked her what happened and finally learned the details. So she borrowed her own trousers. In the evening, the nun returned to the nunnery.</p>
<p>Mistaken Monk. As the sun set, the farmer's husband returned from working in the fields. Because of the hot weather, he was covered in sweat, so he drew water to bathe. After bathing, he changed his clothes and looked for his trousers but could not find them. He asked his wife and learned that she had mistakenly given her husband's trousers to the nun in a hurry. His five-year-old son said, "A monk came to our house, and my mother treated him with refreshments. He borrowed a pair of trousers before leaving." The child could not distinguish between right and wrong and thought the bald-headed nun was a monk.</p>
<p>Three Lives Lost Together. When the farmer heard this, he thought his wife was having an affair with a monk. Unable to contain his anger, he wanted to kill his wife. His wife could not defend herself, and in despair, she hanged herself that night. The next day, the nun who borrowed the trousers returned the original pair. Seeing the scene, she was shocked and told the farmer the whole story. When the farmer learned that it was a misunderstanding, he was filled with regret and took his own life in extreme pain. The nun, feeling that she had caused the loss of two lives, could not bear it and also committed suicide with a knife. Thus, three people died together. The groundless rumor arose from a child's word. It is said that the child has now been taken in by relatives.</p>
<p>Publishing News.

Professors from Chinese medicine schools in Taiwan, Fujian, Zhejiang, and other places have contacted the publishing house to purchase copies for teaching. It is said that the first edition has already sold out. The copyright belongs to the Sheng Nian Chinese Medicine Society at No. 78 Yuqingfang, North Sichuan Road.</p>

<p>Chapter 12: A farewell banquet with flowers to leave a beautiful memory. A grand gathering in the garden to compare tea and view the beautiful scenery.</p>
<p>Zuo Shichen actually finished all his work for the day while making the phone call. When A Jin replied on the phone that they would arrive at 7:30, there was still an hour and a half to go. Going too early would be boring, so he wanted to take advantage of this free time to spread out his manuscript and write something. He seriously wrote only two lines and then put the manuscript away. He walked over to Liu Xing's desk where he was translating Western texts and talked to him. He said that there was no news in the Western newspapers today. "I'm almost done with my work. Let's go eat at a small restaurant." Zuo Shichen said, "I have another appointment today." Fearing that Liu Xing would ask him who was hosting, he walked away. He went to stand on the balcony on the third floor and saw that the electric lights on the left, right, front, and back were already on. The noisy sounds of singing mixed with the sounds of vehicles on the road were playing a symphony. The outlines of the tall buildings were dissolved into a sea of light. He walked back in and lingered until the clock on the wall struck seven. He went to Yizhixiang first. He thought that their timing could not be accurate. Even if they said they would arrive at 7:30, perhaps there would be a performance at Yizhixiang, so he came early to serve them first. It took three minutes for the rickshaw to run from Wangping Street to Yizhixiang on the crowded Fuzhou Road. When he walked up the stairs of Yizhixiang and looked at the big clock opposite, it hadn't struck seven yet. The long hand was pointing at 56 minutes. Zuo Shichen thought that the clocks in Shanghai probably had the time of the whole world, but he didn't know whose time was correct. In short, people always made progress within this time. When he went up the stairs, a waiter came to greet him and took him to the small room. There was a certain prelude. First, two hot towels were sent up. Sometimes they were so hot that they burned. Some people said that Chinese people's skin was burned old by these hot towels, so young girls don't need that kind of hot towel. The towel was handed up and they never wiped their faces. At most, they wiped their hands. It doesn't matter if they're old hands. It's still a good noun in Chinese society! After wiping with the hot towel, a cup of tea was immediately served. Ordinary guests were served tea in a covered bowl. Regular customers were treated preferentially by the waiters and served in a long glass cup. They specially brewed a cup of tea. There was black tea and sugar cubes. There was green tea with a few tea leaves floating on top and gradually sinking. Zuo Shichen was favored by the white-clothed waiters. In addition to the red and green teas, they sent him a cup of lemon tea. A slice of lemon floated in the glass cup like a wheel, and a lot of sugar was added. It looked lightly colored, but when you drank it, it was sweet and sour, just like today's situation.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Gold Prices Break the 600 Tael Barrier <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Closing at 598.8 taels</p>
<p>A jump of 3.5 taels from last weekend</p>
<p>Breaking the new record from the beginning of the month. Yesterday, the 16th, the gold market soared, breaking the new record from the beginning of the month by exceeding 600 taels. However, the fluctuations were uncertain. The morning market had a change of 12 taels, and the afternoon market also had a fluctuation of 7-8 taels. The market was chaotic. The industry was quite bullish, but the buying and selling were confusing. The quantities were not large because the waves were too big. As for foreign exchange, it has been quoted down four blocks, and the internal market is also quite firm.</p>
<p>Swap Spread Out Three to Four Taels. Yesterday, the August contract was spread out by the bulls due to the swap rate. Therefore, it opened at 8:00 AM. The July-August spread was spread out by the bulls because there was too much spot. It was initially estimated at three to four taels, and later two to three taels. It once decreased to about one and a half taels. The result was that the July contract opened at 589.8 taels and closed at 97.2 taels, an increase of 21.9 taels compared to last Saturday. However, there was no transaction. This was because the August contract was being converted. Therefore, the listing was canceled in the afternoon.</p>
<p>An Amazing Peak Appeared. The August contract soared from the morning because the big bearish trend yesterday had unexpectedly broken through 90 taels. Afterwards, the potential was unpredictable, and a few taels of backwardation was not considered strange. At noon, the exchange rate was particularly tight, and buyers were also emboldened. Therefore, the market surged and suddenly broke through 600 taels. Taixing, Yuanxing, Yongyuanmao, Yongyuan, and other firms bought in, while Yuancheng, Yongfu, Changzhi, Fengyong, and others had mixed buying and selling. Later in the market, the transactions of various firms were still unpredictable, and the market was firm and flat. An amazing peak appeared, calling for 603.2 taels, and then there were fluctuations of six or seven taels that were difficult to grasp. Afterwards, it stood at around 599 taels.</p>
<p>The August Contract Opened High at 90 Taels. The August contract opened at 592.5 taels in the morning, and there were many buyers. Afterwards, due to the activity of sellers, it dropped to 89.6 taels. The gross margin was as high as 98 taels. The exchange rate was looking bearish, and people's hearts were extremely firm. When the government announced the price, it was 93.5 taels. After the listing, it was reduced by one penny. The US dollar was reduced by two yuan, and the Japanese gold was increased by 7.875 cents, so it was increased by four taels to 97.5 taels. After 9:30, it suddenly softened because the internal market of the exchange rate was easy to loosen. The English gold banks did business with each other in September at 5 pence and 875. Sumitomo issued October at 875. Mitsui issued recent Japanese gold at 1.38 taels. In addition, large households sold off, breaking through 90 taels. At 10:30, it was 89.6 taels. In an instant, it turned to a high peak, which was unpredictable. Then, various firms bought in, and the exchange rate also became firm. Speculators rushed in and suddenly broke through 600 taels. At noon, it was 601.5 taels, with fluctuations of two or three taels. It closed at 600.02 taels at noon.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Opened at 603.2 Taels. The afternoon market opened with an increase to 603.2 taels. The prices were high. Afterwards, Yuancheng, Yongfu, Chang, and other firms sold off. The exchange rate also seemed to be loosening, and it slowly decreased, a sharp drop of more than 7 taels. Around 3 o'clock, it was 95.5 taels. The recent English gold could be settled in September at 5 pence 75. Japanese merchants bought it at 5 pence 9375 to 6 pence. People's hearts were frustrated. Afterwards, Yuanxing, Yongyuanmao, Yongyuan, and Dalian gangs bought in. Moreover, the September English gold bank absorbed 5 pence 875. At 3:30, it jumped 5 taels to 600.067 taels. Then it went back to a small 3 taels and suddenly added 3 taels. People's hearts were confused, resulting in sudden changes. After 4 o'clock, it was suppressed from 600 to 97.56 taels. At the close of 4:30, it was 598.8 taels. After that, a large one tael was re-traded between 600 taels.</p>
<p>Pressing more than 80 taels. The maximum price of the day was 603.2 taels, and the minimum price was 589.5 taels, with a fluctuation of 13.7 taels. The posted price has been changed to 683.4 taels. The Japanese gold was priced at 7.875 cents, with a pressure of 83.4 taels. The books recorded 597.8 taels for July and 600 taels for August. The supplementary water was 97 taels. In the afternoon, it was 96 taels. The goods opened at 90.1 taels in the morning, closed at 600 taels at noon, 602.5 taels in the afternoon, and closed at 600 taels.</p>
<p>Various firms bought and sold at the same time. The amount was not large. The transactions of various firms included Taixing, Yuanxing, Yongcheng, Fengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Yudaifu, Yuanyongsen, Changyong, and others. Zhifeng, Fengchun, Yuanyong, Yuancheng, Yongfuchang, and others exited and entered again. Hengxing had mixed buying and selling. Wanxing and Fuxingyong exited slightly. In the afternoon, Yuanmaoyong, Yuanxingyong, Yongchengyong, Yuda Yifengyong all entered. Fuchang, Yuandayong, Taifeng, Runshunli, and retail customers all exited. Chengyongyong Hengxing exited and entered suddenly. Wanxing entered more and exited less, but the number of each firm's balance (after offsetting) was not large because the exchange has now limited it to no more than a thousand. The Dalian gang sold more than 2,000 strips in the morning and bought more than 1,500 strips. The transactions in the afternoon were balanced with approximately 900 strips of buying and selling. The Cantonese gang's agency trading was also very large.</p>

It rebounded at noon and seemed to relax in the afternoon. The gold standard has begun to drop, but it is extremely chaotic. Fluctuations of several taels occur from time to time. The total for the day is thirteen or fourteen taels of twists and turns.

The arbitrage and draft calculations are more than sixty or seventy taels apart. The demand from Chinese merchants exceeds the supply, and the British gold traded more than 400,000 pounds, once rising by 200,000 pounds, which was sold by Mitsubishi, East Asia, HSBC, Yokohama Specie Bank, Sumitomo, etc. There were also sales in the gold industry to Yokohama Specie Bank, Shanghai, Korea, Sumitomo, Zhejiang, etc., each for 100,000 pounds.

<h3 id="e197">Sudden Surge in Foreign Interest <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday, the foreign interest rate suddenly soared, a sudden and unexpected event among peers. According to the formal market, such a rampant move would never occur. The current situation is affected by the irregular tightness and looseness of funds. In the past, when it was urgently tight, the interest rate was suppressed. Now that it is extremely loose, large foreign firms with short positions must take the opportunity to buy to offset their positions. Therefore, they compete with each other, resulting in a leapfrog advance. In one day, it actually rose to two percent.</p>
<p>Interest Rate (Foreign Interest Rate): The early market was seven qian one fen eight li one hao two hu and a half. The noon market was seven qian one fen eight li and a half, which is two percent more than the previous day's early market. It cannot be said that the market has undergone a dramatic change. However, people's hearts are not very panicked, so the market atmosphere can still be strongly calmed. (Silver Interest Rate): The early market transfer was one qian three fen, which seems to be five fen better than the previous day. In the noon market, it was done at one qian four fen midway, and the closing price was also one qian three fen. The bank's listed price was five fen, with a head of one qian or so including water. The bank's head lining is moderately tight and loose. The deposit on Saturday is sufficient for distribution.</p>
<p>Auxiliary Coin Market: Most of the Jiangnan small foreign coins were stable. The early market was six qian three fen five li and a half, which was slightly higher than the previous day's early market by two li. The noon market was the same. Transactions were only 4,000 jiao in the early market. The Guangdong small foreign coins fluctuated slightly. The early market was five qian nine fen five li. The noon market was five qian nine fen five li and a half, which was only higher than the previous day by half a li. Transactions were 90,000 jiao in the early market and 60,000 jiao in the noon market. However, copper coins suddenly shrank by 4,000 wen to 404,000 wen.</p>
<p>Silver and Foreign Coin Inflow and Outflow (Silver): Yesterday, the bank's opening and closing chips had a large circulation shortage, and the coordination was quite costly. Yesterday, the bank slightly received money, and the weekend deposit was sufficient for use, so there was no problem. Chinese merchants received and settled 3.3 to 3.4 million, foreign merchants received and settled more than 2.4 million. Various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous funds received and settled nearly 10 million. In addition, there were more than 2 million settlement funds, more than 1 million special funds, 500,000 to 600,000 deposit redemptions, 800,000 into the warehouse, and 600,000 out of the warehouse. Japanese merchants and banks received and settled more than 5 million of various funds and 500,000 into the warehouse. Qianzhuang and silver companies received and settled more than 43 million, and the head funds received and settled more than 6.4 million. Various exchange funds were more than 1.4 million, and more than 1 million were settled in cash. (Foreign Coins): Exchange ticket funds made 1.235 million in the early market, and 15,000 in banknotes. In the noon market, exchange ticket funds made 930,000, and 10,000 in banknotes. In addition, 300,000 ○ 6,000 in banknotes were made in the two markets outside the market. Bank transactions were 550,000 in the early market and 600,000 in the noon market. In addition, 500,000 to 600,000 were bought in. Various banks and foreign firms received and settled more than 1.7 million, and banknotes in and out were more than 2 million. Qianzhuang and foreign companies received and settled more than 4.8 million, and the foreign head funds received and settled more than 2.4 million. The borrowing of foreign funds was more than 1.8 million, and the transaction of small qianzhuang was more than 800,000. 600,000 were loaded to Guangdong and Qingdao.</p>

<p>Military Reduction and Customs Duties Fell by More Than Yuan, and Other Debts Continued to Wither</p>
<p>The Sino-French US Dollar Bonds Were Auctioned Yesterday for Spot</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the inflow and outflow of spot goods in the securities market was as scarce as before, the futures market suddenly turned prosperous. The buying and selling in the pre- and post-markets was very lively. Demobilization, customs duties, and military reduction bonds all had huge transactions. It is estimated that 6.6 million was opened in the morning and 6.8 million in the afternoon. The changes in yesterday's bonds were still good in the early morning, and the ups and downs were still slight compared to the previous day. Later, the sales of customs duties, military reductions, etc. on the market were very strong, and their prices fell as a result. In the afternoon, the market was chaotic, and the market price suddenly hovered. As a result, compared with last weekend, the military reduction continued to fall by more than one yuan, the customs duty for June fell by one yuan and several jiao, and the others also fell by small half yuan. Only the continuous scroll had very little change.

<p>Tight Exchange Rate and Rising Gold Prices Stimulate Sales</p>
<p>The yarn market has become firmer, and although the decline in foreign cotton yarn is fierce, the exchange rate has shrunk surprisingly, and people's hearts are excited. The market has risen, and the sales of Sichuan merchants are more active. However, there are still 10,000 to several thousand bales in the warehouse. The sales of this commodity are very sluggish. Therefore, the sellers' attitude is calm, and there are still many buyers who are bullish on the expensive gold and cheap silver.</p>
<p>The public bidding has turned up by one tael. Due to the exchange rate relationship, the hearts of the foreigners are harder. Retail investors have bought in. Dafeng bought 1,600 bales short, Lichang bought 1,400 bales, and Yichang sold 1,400 bales. As a result, each month rose by 2, 5, 6, and 8 qian. It was heard in the afternoon that Sichuan merchants had actual needs, and the gold price broke through 600 taels, discovering a new high price. The popularity became tighter, and each month rose by another 3, 4, 6, and 7 qian. It was found that most of the purchases in the afternoon were made by gold merchants. The total transaction volume for the day was 17,850 bales. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>The Sichuan merchants' ability to absorb cash has suddenly strengthened, and the sales of spot yarn are more active. It was found that the total purchase by each merchant on the day was 1,875 bales, and 180 bales were purchased among peers. The market was flat. Among the visiting merchants, Sichuan bought 885 bales, Niuzhuang 345 bales, Shantou 130 bales, Zhenjiang 135 bales, inland 90 bales, Weihaiwei 25 bales, Tianjin 50 bales, Xuzhou 85 bales, Wuhu 30 bales, Ningbo 25 bales, Yantai 20 bales, Guangdong 75 bales, and miscellaneous merchants 105 bales.</p>

<p>The Upward Trend is Still Flat, Rising by Two and a Half Qian</p>
<p>The downward trend of American cotton is like a river flowing downhill. The spot price has also broken through the 1.4 jiao mark. The closing situation is quite weak, and most people expect that it will continue to fall. However, the market situation in this port is due to the exchange rate relationship, and the calculated price of foreign cotton has risen both explicitly and implicitly. Therefore, the market has instead tended to rise, but the market atmosphere is more moderate, and the rise is not as激昂as the previous day. In fact, the Han merchants and a part of the sellers have sold at high prices, which has put pressure on it. However, based on the exchange market, it is difficult to see the cotton market as low.</p>
<p>The gold industry absorbs Han Biao Han Jin. Although the price of foreign cotton fell at the opening of the previous market, the price of gold rose, and people's hearts were high. The buying sentiment in the market was tighter, and each rose by 5 fen to 1.5 qian. It was heard in the afternoon that the gold price was empty at 600 taels, discovering a new price. The market atmosphere became more stable, and at the same time, the gold merchants bought in, and each month rose by another 1 qian and a half. The total transaction volume for the day was 42,100 dan. The closing price of Han Biao is listed on the left.</p>

<p>White Rice Rose by Another Half a Jiao</p>
<p>The supply to Zhabei yesterday was insufficient. No. 10 Street sold well. Due to the frequent price increases of northern rice, it was increasingly tight. According to the Wuxi telegraph report, the price of brown rice opened at 16 yuan and 5 jiao. It must be 23 yuan and 1 jiao in the Shanghai market, and the bottom cargo in the unified market is extremely dry. The inventory of rice in each store is only about 200,000 dan. Therefore, people's hearts in this street are unusually firm. At this juncture in the rice hulling season, the source of each road is so small, and the price is also inverted. Then the trend of rice still needs to rise. Yesterday noon, the intention to buy from shops and warehouses was even greedier. Although foreign rice was reported to have poured in, the Saigon small twist saw a high rise. The medium and secondary white rice also rose by one or two jiao. The thin rice saw a mention of Jiao Zuo Tong Bian. The river stock turned thin, and the arrival was also reduced. It also rose nearly a jiao. Currently, the item is opened at around 18 yuan and a half.</p>
<p>The number of ships arriving at the River Rice River South Pier is declining. The Changxi machine rice is about to be cut off. Because the stock will be exhausted, even if a small number arrives, it will be relieved. Therefore, the market is gradually rising. Although there are still Su Tong machine rice seeing arrivals, the price of zero warehouses and township guns are also rising a little bit. Nanbang thin early arrival source is becoming more and more popular. Recently, the market price in each producing area of ​​the south road is extremely tight, and due to the lack of inventory, they look forward to the assistance of foreign rice. Therefore, it is very firm and popular. The high-material thin rice must be around 20 yuan. Due to the lower price of Bian Yuan, all have purchases and the price is tightly rising by one jiao. The arrival of Yin Yuan is rare and the market is stable and quiet.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Foreign Rice Soars by Half a Yuan <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The foreign rice market has risen again and again in recent days. Yesterday, it was boosted by the two major gangs in this street and the mainland. The market atmosphere was even tighter. In addition, households in Wen, Taipei, and other northern areas also inquired, and the arrival was less. The minds of the cargo owners were even firmer, and the price suddenly jumped four or five jiao. People's hearts were still hoping for adulterous gains. If there were no wholesale arrivals soon, the market price would rise again, lamenting the rising price for the poor people. However, it was heard that there were more than 100,000 bags arriving within these few days, and there were still about 200,000 bags on the road. Because the cargo owners were optimistic and lightly guarded, they were unwilling to sell easily. Therefore, the price rose even though the goods arrived. A total of 24,000 bags were opened in the unified market. No. 1 Saigon was 16 yuan and 8 jiao, No. 2 was 15 yuan and 9 jiao, the small twist was 15 yuan and 9 jiao, the large twist was 15 yuan and 5 jiao, Min Dang was 16 yuan, Sugengdi was 16 yuan and 4 jiao and a half, and Ke Gan white rice was 16 yuan and 3 jiao. Xuye rough rice was 14 yuan and 8 jiao, and the small twist rough rice was 14 yuan and 1 jiao. The medium and secondary rice was reduced accordingly.</p>

<p>A Frenzied Jump of Three Cents in the Morning Discovers a New Record</p>
<p>Authorities Intervene in the Afternoon and Many Factories Sell</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market had another huge change. After the market opened in the morning, it saw a rapid rise. This month, it reached as high as two taels, six qian, and seven fen, which was a newly discovered price range. Because the spot flour was very active, the futures also had new buyers. The spot flour market was already shouting as high as two taels and eight qian. This price was even more groundbreaking, so it gave people a stimulating hope. The situation in the first, second, and third rounds in the morning was tight, and the situation in the market was between three and five fen higher than the closing price of the previous day. After the market opened in the afternoon, there was a sudden dramatic change. Due to the authorities' implementation of interventions, the factory's taking advantage of the large sales and throwing, and the bulls' profitable selling, the flour price was greatly impacted. The market price suddenly fell by three or four fen. The final closing price was slightly less than half a cent for June, a little less than one and a half cents for July and August, a little less than one cent for September, a little less than two and a half cents for October, and no change for November.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the wheat market rose even more wildly. The sharpness of the buying seemed to be soaring upwards, without end. The current month actually reached as high as five taels and two qian. This new wheat price range is rare in the past years. Recently, the wheat flour market has been greatly affected by the gold market, and it has also risen horizontally by one qian, jumping up one and a half qian. October, October, and November all reached as high as five taels, two qian, and three fen, which was a large increase of one qian and seven fen to one qian and four or five fen compared to the closing price of last week. The closing price was slightly smaller, with six or seven fen in June and July, five fen in August, eight fen in September, one qian in October, and nine fen in November. There were more than 20,000 bags of spot wheat, with new wheat accounting for nine-tenths of the price, and the price also rose by one qian. The high-priced goods reached as high as five taels, one qian and a half to five fen, the middle price was between five taels and four taels, seven or eight qian. In addition to the mainland, Gaoyou, Liuhe, Shashi, and other places also arrived in Shen. Chen Mai Yaowan goods were five taels and four qian, which also rose by seven or eight fen.</p>

<p>The exchange market for cloth in our factory has changed drastically again, and people's hearts have suddenly turned treacherous. Fine cloth and fine twill have both risen by two and a half cents, and coarse cloth has risen by about five cents. However, it is actually limited due to the off-season. Only fine cloth has a way to dye the blanks, and more than 200 pieces have been traded. The trend of coarse cloth has been very sluggish since the price increase. Ningbo, Shantou, and other gangs have all purchased the original 84 cloth. Blue Flying Fish is four taels and seven qian and a half, Jumping Dance is four taels and six qian and a half, and Ewo bleaching cloth is still firm.</p>
<p>Eastern and Western Piece Goods were uniformly excited yesterday due to the soaring gold prices. Fine oriental goods such as fine poplin rose by 5 li. Ancient City Society opened at two qian and nine fen, Baoqiu at two qian and eight fen and a half, and Huxinting at two qian and five fen and a half. The trend of Yuanzhi tribute silk was even stronger. Santanyinyue has reached three qian and three fen. Moganshan hunting geese are both two qian and eight fen and seven li and a half, and Shuangtonglu is two qian and five fen and two li and a half.

However, the woven fancy yarn is still in a declining trend that is difficult to reverse.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Sugar Market: Coarse Sand and White Suddenly Become Tight <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Very Few 出户, Asking Prices Reach Eight Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market in the producing areas had no telegrams from Cuba, New York, and Java. The market atmosphere of coarse sand and white in the public association suddenly tightened due to the shrinking of the Dutch exchange rate. The buyers' intention to enter was quite strong, and the eating price was fiercely raised to seven taels and seven qian. Although the buyers were willing to absorb it at a high price, it was impossible to meet the demand. There were sporadic asking prices as high as eight taels that had not been accepted, and the chaos of the market was evident. Both the medium sand and white parties were mostly waiting and seeing each other, and could not hold each other down. The Dutch red market also followed closely. The ordinary No. 10 cargo was sold by Zhenxiang Company for more than 500 bags at a price of 6 taels and 3 qian. The asking price in yesterday's market was raised to 6 taels and a half, but there were few inquiries. The Japanese sugar market also rose sharply. Minghua YRO mark had hundreds of bags traded at 8 taels and 1 qian. The price for the later market was raised to 8 taels and 2 qian, the YP mark was 8 taels and 6 qian, and the YT mark was 8 taels and 4 qian. Although there was no transaction, the market was not weak, but the market atmosphere was slightly inferior to that of Dutch sugar. The market had several hundred bags of Shanghai factory Benbing opened at a price increase of 2 qian, with Ren character at 10 taels and 6 qian and Qian character at 10 taels and 4 qian. The market was quite elegant.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Correspondence Regarding the Difficult Play Movement <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Editor,</p>
<p>The following is a brief report on our Difficult Play Movement before and after its execution. Please grant us a small space in the artistic world to announce this to the public, and we hope to receive guidance and assistance from those who generally love drama.</p>
<p>(I) Motivation for Holding the Difficult Play Movement</p>
<p>It can be said that there are two motivations for us to hold this Difficult Play Movement. The first is the loss incurred on May 10th and 11th. We know ourselves that our audience is more than this. We thought it must have been affected by the tram strike. Therefore, we wanted to revive "Uncle Vanya" at the same time. Afraid that one performance of "Uncle Vanya" would not be able to recover our costs, we decided to add "The Dog's Dance" and "Peach Blossom Spring". The second motivation is because the general audience who have seen our "Peach Blossom Spring" still mention it from time to time. Therefore, we think this play is worth performing again. At the same time, some people have been encouraging us to revive "The Dog's Dance" because it only played for one day last year. So we decided to revive three plays at the same time. Because these three plays are all recognized as difficult plays, we regarded these three plays as a systematic Difficult Play Movement.</p>
<p>(II) Planned Repertoire</p>
<p>In our dedication, we have already explained clearly that our original repertoire was like this: the first sound of the movement was "The Dog's Dance," the second sound was "Uncle Vanya," and the third sound was "Peach Blossom Spring," from despair to hope, from hope to action. However, because several characters in "The Dog's Dance" and "Uncle Vanya" are played by the same actors, we feared the loss of individuality. We had to perform "Uncle Vanya" first. There were other reasons, so we had to change our ideal repertoire.</p>
<p>(III) Various Difficulties During the Movement</p>
<p>(1) The Fewness of the Audience: On the day of the revival of "Uncle Vanya" on the 31st, we found that our audience was even smaller than before. So we understood that we had lost our original audience. Because of this reason, many members were as discouraged as the Peach Fairies in the second act of Peach Blossom Spring. Fortunately, we still had hermit-like members who encouraged each other to complete this movement.</p>
<p>(2) Loss of Helpers: We know very well that the reason why we lost our audience is because the plays we perform are too profound and too dull. At the same time, the internal members also did not feel interested and scattered. For this large movement, we only had about twenty people in total, which makes us proud and heartbroken. (3) Changes in Staff and Actors: At a time when there were so few people, our business manager Hong Chengfu and set director Wu Senkang had to return to Ningbo due to family matters until the 6th before returning to Shanghai. Our important actors Luo Mingfeng and Tang Yuanfan also resigned from their tasks, one due to important professional matters, and the other due to the Fudan performance of "Cyrano de Bergerac." Therefore, our organization was somewhat chaotic, and the division of powers could not be clearly defined. At the same time, the staff and actors on the stage could not concentrate on preparing for the play and helping with the work in the front of the house.</p>
<p>(4) Difficulties in Rehearsing: Among the three plays in this movement, "Uncle Vanya" was rehearsed well, but "The Dog's Dance" was a year ago, and "Peach Blossom Spring" was more than two years ago, and many roles had to be changed, so it had to be rehearsed again. However, we simply could not spare much time. For "Peach Blossom Spring," we completely sacrificed one night of sleep on the evening of the 7th to rehearse it.</p>
<p>(5) Economic Embarrassment: Outsiders usually feel that our theater troupe is very financially sufficient. Yes, according to our expenses, it does look very wealthy. However, this money is only spent on the stage. Not to mention that staff and actors do not dare to have extravagant enjoyment, even the advertising money is very stingy. Naturally, compared to poorer theater troupes, we seem to have much more strength. But precisely because of this, we want to do our best to make more perfect contributions in stage technology. But we were too bold. This time our loss may exceed one thousand. Now there is still a large amount of debt unpaid. If we cannot handle it properly within this week, we may end up in an unimaginable situation.</p>
<p>(IV) Results of the Movement</p>
<p>(1) The Outside World's View of Us: Although we had very few audiences this time, these were all eliminated. They are all audiences who truly support us and love our dramas. So they are satisfied with our movement this time. Also, the literary and artistic circles have expressed their satisfaction with us verbally.</p>
<p>(2) Our View of the Outside World This Time: We are very grateful to the outside world, not because of their praise of us, but because of their sincere corrections to us. We have accepted everything possible. Also, Chun Jun, who criticized our "Peach Blossom Spring" in Shen Bao, and Chun Sen Jun, who criticized our "Uncle Vanya" in the Min Guo Daily, I don't know if it is the same person or who it is. He has great hope for our future. We are grateful to him. We will always endure hardships like Miss Qin, and persevere like the Peach Fairies, so as not to disappoint him.</p>
<p>(3) Our Own View of Ourselves: Although the outside world has expressed satisfaction with our movement this time, we are all very regretful. Everyone's face shows a somewhat dissatisfied expression, because the shortcomings are only the clearest to ourselves. None of us have achieved our ideals. On this point, we can tell the comrades who care about us that we seem to still have hope of moving forward.</p>
<p>(4) The Representative Plays of This Movement: Drama is a comprehensive art. Everyone knows how complicated the organization inside is. As long as one staff member or actor makes a mistake, the whole play will be ruined. This time, because of the lack of manpower and the busyness of affairs, our play could not be like a machine, always the same (we used to be like this). There were several times when we really did not dare to admit it was our play. However, among the six performances of "Vanya," we admit the two performances of The Dog's Dance on the morning of May 10th, the two performances of Peach Blossom Spring on the morning of June 7th, and the performance on the evening of the 8th. We admit that these three performances are the representative plays of our movement this time.</p>
<p>(V) Our Future</p>
<p>(1) To Get Back Our Audience and Our Helpers: Our first thing to do in the future is to find a way to get back our original audience and helpers. Our specialization in difficult plays is our success, but we have failed because of this. Our audience and helpers are also our failures. Therefore, we must find a way to get them back.</p>
<p>(2) Our Future Policy: When Chinese drama is just sprouting, when the audience is not yet interested in and does not believe in new dramas, and when we have not yet grasped the psychology of the Beijing opera audience, it is also a wrong policy to perform these difficult plays. Therefore, we must change our policy in the future and perform plays that are more sympathetic to the audience or more accessible plays. However, we hope that those who care about us will not be pessimistic about us. We want to set up elementary schools and think about dividing them into periods, just like dividing them into classes, and proceed in sequence.</p>
<p>(3) Internal Reorganization: Mr. Zhu Suicheng has a very good plan to change our organization and divide it into viewing group members and working group members. Normally, there should be frequent training to improve the dramatic level of the viewers and workers. Now this proposal is only a private discussion among everyone. After these matters are all settled, we will submit it to the committee for detailed discussion. After a decision is made, there will naturally be progress.

<h3 id="e212">Qualification Issues and University Education <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Dear Reader,</p>
<p>I would very much like to discuss this issue with you, but because I am burdened with affairs, I rush through the day. Today, I am finally able to write. The motivation for me to discuss this issue is that two months ago, when the National Education Conference opened, a reporter from the Shanghai Times News published an article in his newspaper discussing current university education. I read it and had some thoughts. Later, this article was reprinted by the Tianjin Guo Wen Weekly (I forgot which issue). The fact that this article is worth noting is undoubtedly undeniable. The gist of this article is (because I don't have this newspaper on hand, it is inconvenient to check, so I can only write the general idea):</p>
<p>"The level of current university education is too low. It has regressed compared to when schools were first established, and there is a sense of decline. Taking the tool of learning - writing - as an example, in the past, university students, in addition to their native language, had at least two or three foreign languages. What about today's university students? Not to mention that they cannot master foreign languages, even their native language is not as good as that of middle and primary school students in the past. Some even cannot write an ordinary letter fluently. Therefore, the urgent task now is to enrich the content of university courses and improve the level of university education."</p>
<p>The meaning of this article is to show the current state of university education and to urge current education authorities and people in society to pay attention to it. From this, it can be seen that the shallowness of the level of university education is a very obvious fact, and the fact that knowledgeable people in society regard it as a disease is "everyone thinks the same, everyone feels the same." However, let's think about why the level of current university education is lower than before. There should be a reason. If we find this reason, we will be able to prescribe the right medicine. Otherwise, no matter what method you use to reform, it will not work. However, the so-called reason is of course several kinds. What we want to find is the most fundamental reason. So I did some investigation. What is the fundamental reason for the shallowness of the level of current university education? Unexpectedly, the thing that I immediately thought of was "qualification." I dare to argue that "if the issue of qualification is not broken one day, the level of university education cannot be improved one day." However, when the "qualification issue" is deeply rooted and unbreakable in today's politics and education, people will definitely think that this kind of argument is made by a madman. Therefore, the qualification issue and university education must be discussed in detail. The reason for the poor level of university education, according to the shallow speculation of ordinary people, is generally thought to lie in the fact that there are too many students who have studied in the East and the West and returned to China. There are too many new bureaucrats and frustrated politicians in the past few years. Students who have studied abroad have nothing to do, so they want to run universities. Bureaucrats and politicians want to gain false fame and win over students, so they also want to run universities. These two kinds of people all want to run universities, so wild chicken universities are everywhere. The motivation for establishing wild chicken universities is fundamentally not concerned with education, so they indiscriminately enroll students, the equipment is simple, and the professors are sloppy. As a result, how can the level of students not be shallow? Since there are many wild chicken universities, students don't have to worry about not having a place to go to school. As a result, it also affects middle school students not paying much attention to their homework. Since the level of middle school is poor, how can the level of university not be shallow? As a result, the level of non-wild chicken universities is also shallow. Therefore, the way to improve the level of university education is to shut down wild chicken universities. I think the reason for this kind of speculation is superficial. Although I relatively agree with this method of improving the level of university education, it is not fundamental. Let's think further. The reason why there are so many wild chicken universities is, of course, that students who have studied abroad have nothing to do, and that bureaucrats and politicians want to sell their reputation, fish for fame, and win over students as their genes. But every time I ask, wild chicken universities always have more than three or five hundred students. There are so many people going to university. What is the reason for this? Today's university students - especially those in wild chicken universities - spend at least five hundred yuan a year. Their fathers and brothers are naturally not all capitalists. Are they willing to give so much of their hard-earned money to their children to spend? The level of today's universities is unreliable. Don't they all understand this? However, the number of people who painstakingly provide their children to go to university is increasing day by day. There must be a reason for this. There is no need to say that it is difficult to live in society today. Without a university degree, one cannot obtain a decent position in society. Especially if you want to be an official, you cannot rise to prominence without a university degree. If you want to be promoted, of course, this example is not included, but there will also be criticism of "personal favoritism." That is, future national examinations also require a university diploma to be eligible to take the exam. Therefore, it can be summarized in one sentence: "The purpose of today's fathers and brothers providing their children to go to university is for "qualification." The purpose of students going to university to study is also for "qualification." Everything else outside of qualification is not a very important issue. Then how can the level of university education not be shallow? Also, because the purpose of students studying is only to obtain "qualification," professors with knowledge often have such a sigh: "I teach so hard, but I am just creating diplomas for them. Why bother?" Students whose real purpose is not to learn but to obtain "qualification" request to be exempt from exams, reduce the number of questions, issue more handouts, and read fewer reference books. It is indeed too uncomfortable for knowledgeable professors. Therefore, those with a little money do not want to teach at universities, and today's university education is built on the students' diplomas and the teachers' salaries. My university students and professors have agreed with this statement. How can the level of university education not be shallower? From this, everyone can make a fair judgment: is the fundamental reason for the low level of university education the establishment of many wild chicken universities, or is it the importance that the general public in society attaches to the issue of qualification? We can answer immediately: if the general public does not have a need for qualification, then wild universities</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>chicken universities will absolutely not be able to operate successfully. The reason for the low level of university education lies entirely in the importance that the general public in society attaches to the issue of qualification. Attributing the low level of university education to wild chicken universities is a superficial theory and is putting the cart before the horse. Therefore, to improve the level of university education, we must first break the issue of qualification. That is, the kind of talent that society needs must go through national examinations. This kind of examination should absolutely not be limited to qualification. We must take into account his daily cultivation. As long as he is given a rigorous examination, the awarding of degrees will be the same. Then the level of university education will naturally be improved. (Qie Xiang)</p>

<p>Nanyang Middle School, which has been operating in Shanghai for more than 30 years, recently held its spring sports meet at the China Athletics Field. Hundreds of athletes competed on the green lawn to show their good skills. Among them, four records were broken, setting new school records. It is commendable that secondary schools have achieved such good results. The new records are as follows:</p>
<p>100 meters (Huang Guanxiong) Record: 11.3 seconds</p>
<p>1500 meters (Liang Yanping) Record: 4 minutes and 32 seconds</p>
<p>Low Hurdles (Huang Chengliang) Record: 28 seconds</p>
<p>Discus (Pan Risheng) Record: 25.68 meters</p>
<p>On June 12, the school held an awards ceremony for the winners in the school's alumni hall. Teachers, alumni, guests, and students attended, totaling more than a thousand people. The prizes were extremely rich. The awards were presented by Mr. Gu Tianfang, the school's director of studies. Mr. Gu recently returned to China from Japan, where he observed overseas Chinese education. He gave a speech of about half an hour at the meeting. His words were pertinent and thought-provoking, and could be regarded as golden rules in this period when physical education is urgently needed. Here are a few excerpts for the consideration of the gentlemen of the world.</p>
<p>"When I visited various primary and secondary schools in Japan, I saw that their school buildings, even those with great reputations, were shallow and dilapidated, with very few tall halls and buildings. The sports fields were not very large either. This is because Japan is small and densely populated, so it cannot be otherwise. Since the sports fields are small, the practice time must be rotated so that some students can avoid being left out. Although the practice time is short, the reason why their results are excellent is because they have perseverance. Compared to the ordinary schools in Japan, our sports fields are more than adequate. Gentlemen, please do not miss such a great opportunity.</p>
<p>In Japan, it is rare to see people with fair complexions like us. This is because people like to exercise and exercise in the sunlight, which turns them black. Over time, people have also shifted their aesthetic concepts to regard black as a symbol of health and love it deeply. From this, we can see the general national character. How does this compare to our country's worship of "fair-faced scholars"?</p>
<p>Japanese people, regardless of gender, age, or size, like to exercise. They often play ball and kick ball on the small roads next to their houses after work. How does this compare to our countrymen who play mahjong and smoke cigarettes in their free time?</p>
<p>Japanese people have perseverance and perseverance in sports, unlike our country's athletes who are exposed to the sun for one day and then cold for ten days. In the Far East Games, the Japanese have long wanted to win the football title. Therefore, they practiced desperately and did not hesitate to send players to the United States to learn new methods at great expense. In terms of technology, our country has indeed made progress, but only knows how to stick to the old methods. Therefore, when the Japanese side used a new formula during the war, our country's players were confused. Although the Japanese could not win the entire championship, they were able to vent their anger for a while.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you are young and strong. Please work hard in order to win glory for the country in the future. This is my sincere hope."</p>
<h3 id="e214">A Letter Worthy of Attention <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Discussing the Issue of Transferring Schools</p>
<p>"You know me, right? I am the most protective of our school. Although everything in our school cannot completely satisfy people, it can still be considered the best among the wild chicken universities in Shanghai. Just talking about the law department, the director is concurrently held by the president of the school, who is a doctor of law. Half of the professors are professors from the Soochow University Law School, and half are judges and prosecutors from the Provisional Court. It can be said that it is a gathering of talents from the Shanghai legal community. New students cannot be arbitrarily inserted into classes, and students in school cannot be absent from classes without reason. On these few points, we often boast that our school's law department is the second law school of Soochow University. We can study in such a school without having to think about going abroad to seek higher education and quietly wait for graduation. But the problem comes.</p>
<p>The biggest problem we have, I think you understand, is the issue of the school's registration. We know that a student studying law whose diploma is not from a national university or a private university law school that has been registered by the Ministry of Education and recognized by the Judicial Yuan, then the diploma he or she gets is equal to a piece of waste paper. It is not legally effective. You cannot take the judicial examination to become a judge or a lawyer. The school authorities of our school also feel the importance of this issue. Therefore, in the last semester, they have been working hard to raise funds and purchase a base. However, although the school base has been purchased, covering fifty acres, there is still no good news about the construction of the school building after a semester. I dare to say that our school only needs to build a school building to be registered by the Ministry of Education, and the recognition of the Ministry of Justice is even less of a problem. Alas, the school building is a prerequisite for registration. Why don't the school authorities rush to proceed to comfort the hopes of all the students? Isn't the law school on Jiangwan Road adding school buildings, which our classmates have all seen with their own eyes? Touching the scenery, what should we feel?</p>
<p>Brother Jian, I personally absolutely cherish our school, but my parents are forcing me to transfer schools, saying that if I don't transfer schools, I will cut off my way out. Smart Brother Jian, do you think it is better to wait for our school to be registered in the future, or is it better to transfer schools immediately? Assuming I transfer schools, the best law school in Shanghai is of course Soochow, but my English level is not high enough. Then which school should I transfer to? Please give me some advice."</p>
<p>The above is a letter written to me by a classmate. Our school's law department is not bad, this is a fact. As for transferring schools, except for Soochow, it is inevitable to degrade the requirements. The school authorities are not doing their best to proceed with the registration, this is also a fact. If I don't transfer schools, it is inevitable to suffer a loss in my own way out. I really cannot answer this question. However, I believe that our school can definitely build a school building and be registered within two years. Once the school is registered, the graduated students will also receive the same benefits. Therefore, if there is no other reason to transfer schools at present, or if there is no suitable school to transfer to for the time being, it is better not to transfer. I replied to my classmate with this intention.</p>
<p>I also feel that there must be not a few students in Shanghai who have transferred schools due to the school registration issue. But it can be understood by looking at the large number of transfer students absorbed by the registered schools every semester. Therefore, I published this classmate's letter to show that the school's inability to register temporarily is also one of the reasons for students' transfer, and it is worthy of everyone's attention.</p>

<p>I have already introduced all the literary and academic societies in CUHK in this column. Now let me talk about its research associations. Speaking of its research associations, the most notable one is the Hexapoecia Society. The Hexapoecia Society, translated into Chinese, is the Six-Legged Society. This association is organized by students of the Department of Plant Pathology and Entomology of the College of Agriculture of CUHK and staff of the Jiangsu Provincial Entomology Bureau (the Jiangsu Entomology Bureau is located on the CUHK campus, so when people talk about the Heaxpoecia Society, they say it is the CUHK Hexapoecia Society. Please forgive me for also referring to it as the CUHK Hexapoecia Society here). It is dedicated to connecting emotions and researching entomology (especially locusts). It was announced in September and October of the year before last (the 17th year). It is said that the reason why it is named Heaxpoecia is because its purpose is to study entomology, especially locusts, and locusts have six legs, so they named it after six legs. (Xian Rong)</p>

<p>A few students in the CUHK Law School believe that studying law, politics, and economics cannot be effectively achieved by using textbooks in a dead way. Therefore, they also follow the example of those who study physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine by conducting experiments and organizing field surveys and investigations. It is heard that their procedures for organizing field surveys and investigations are to start by organizing a social survey society. The content is roughly divided into three points: (1) Engage in folk surveys to collect actual data on society. (2) Select problems that must be solved from the actual data. (3) Study each problem separately before gathering to debate. (Xian Rong)</p>
