<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本之新滿蒙政策</h3>
<p>日本自滿鐵收入銳減而後。即相驚以華方壓迫滿鐵。力謀所以應付之法。近其外務省且與滿鐵當局協議。决提新滿蒙政策於閣議。以移爲對華交涉。此亦一可異之消息也。夫滿鐵收入之所以銳減。大部分亦爲世界商業衰落之故。而未必由於受中國北寗路發展計劃之影響也。即使稍受北寗路發展影響。然以中國人謀整理中國之交通。計劃東北各路之聯運。確立路政進展之方針。實亦爲獨立國家當然之政策。於此而苟與他國之利益。稍有衝突。亦不得謂之壓迫也。况乎據滿鐵理事神鞭氏所談。中國葫蘆島築港。非數年内所能竣工。與滿鐵並行之路線。如打通線物産不豐。無大關係。吉海缐與寗海線雖減輕運費。影響亦微。現惟北寗線略受對抗形勢。總之華方進行包團滿鐵敷設計劃。尙不感痛癢云云。日本滿鐵之理事。必熟悉滿鐵内情。其所言亦不甚受中國鐵路政策之影響。乃何以外務省方面。竟認定爲中國計劃之壓迫。而急欲以新蒙滿政策對付中國。電通社且謂新政策。雖仍根據於共存共榮之幣原外交。但須視中國如何處置。而下最後之决定。則又呑吐其詞。而其疑神疑鬼與半哄半嚇之情形。亦見言外。竊謂改善對華外交之當局。必不如是也</p>

<p>— 海客</p>
<p>子—父親。甚麽叫做外交家父—外交家是一種冠冕堂皇的說謊專家。對外人說謊越多。對本國功勞越大。</p>
<p>兒—母親。我以爲黑母雞比白母雞來得聰明。</p>
<p>母—你怎麽知道。</p>
<p>兒—但看我們的那頭黑母雞和白母雞便可知道。不見那黑母雞會生出一個白蛋來。而白母雞却生不出一個黑蛋來。所以我說黑母雞比白母雞來得聰明。</p>
<p>甲—我這一枝手槍是孔夫子時代的。</p>

<h3>眞茹國際大電台開幕記</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>交通部國際無缐大電台。於月之六日舉行開幕典禮爲我國破天荒之盛舉。先期柬邀各界領袖前往參觀。爰將是日見聞所及。錄實本談。</p>
<p>是日交通部派員在北站招待。來賓簽名後。贈以賽磁徽章一枚佩於胸際。可抵車票。蓋該部包有頭二三等車六輛。專爲迎送來賓至眞茹之用。一時一刻啓輪。十五分鐘即抵眞茹。因電台距車站尙有數里之遙。故已預雇汽車十輛。頭上挿有小旗。分送來賓前往。每車限乘六人。車少人多。經十餘次始運完。電台基地。計一百九十一畝四分一釐九毫。距閘北約十五華里。濱桃浦特築許家橋。是日橋上高搭松柏牌坊。上懸「開幕典禮」四大字。經牌坊後。即該台門房。大門口黨國旗成交叉形。三鐵塔高矗雲霄。頂上亦懸旗彩。臨風招展。煞是好看。天綫網密佈空中。發報室内機器林立。電力室三面玻璃。下爲啣筒室。業已生火。其聲軋軋不絕。空地上有一蓄水池。環池築有馬路。未開會前武裝巡士分乘機器脚踏車。繞池競走。宛似新年内小孩所購之走馬燈。觀者如堵。禮堂在馬路旁臨時搭一大蘆蓆棚。計十間闊。十四間長。門外遍挿萬國旗。内設座椅數百。台上懸總理遺象。及「革命尙未成功。同志務須努力」之紙聯中設一桌。覆以白毯。上置無線電收音機。桌後設椅十餘。成半圓形。王正廷夫婦同車來。禮堂上因係泥地。故上覆蘆蓆。但高低不平。王夫人非天足行走更不便。乃由招待員在旁扶持。台前兩排座椅。係外賓席。男女均有。法領事等。則與中央國府代表。及王部長等。皆在台上。行開幕禮時。先讀遺囑。外賓皆隨衆行禮。低頭靜默。王伯羣部長主席。報告開會宗旨時。始立桌右。因收音不便。由司儀者請其改立台中。詞係預先刷印。注重四點。（一）適應國家及人的需要。（二）保障國際通信之權利。（三）促進國際間之情感。（四）增加國際宣傳之效能。洋洋千餘言。中央代表吳道一致詞。以無線電台比喻人之喉舌。國府代表張羣致詞。詳述我國電政事業之歷史。自光緒八年起。至本日止。源源本本。如數家珍。業電政事業者咸歎弗如。王正廷演說。謂有此電台。以後國際間通信。可不假手外人。俾與各國互通消息。可免隔膜。於外交上頗有關係。當塲爲王伯羣賀喜。於是台下拍手相迎。並有王部與長王部長賀喜之妙語。繼王氏演說者。係葉惠鈞。脫除大衣。即現手槍觀衆無不注意。渠謂今日出席。係用東家（即主人）資格。蓋中華民國成立迄今。業已十有九年。名爲民主。但受苦甚深。予亦東家之一。今日覩此電台。深信交通部辦事得力。目若近視。耳如重聽。即人身交通不便。無線電台之於國家。與人身耳目相似。語時突梯滑稽。臨行並有粗言亂道。好戲在後等語。衆皆捧腹。旋法領事甘格林演說。用法語。經人翻譯。繼法領演說者。尙有美國無線電公司遠東經理能司。與美國無線電公司總代表李白。因時間關係。均由主席聲明不再翻譯矣。秩序上本有宣讀賀電一項。旋因節省時刻起見。改爲報告發電人姓名。散會後。同至水池旁合攝一影。參觀畢用茶點後。分乘汽車至站。五時啓輪。抵滬時已萬家燈火矣。</p>
<h3>秋日同古微海藏子大叔雍蓴農公渚拔可伯夔集劍丞夬園同用齊天樂調賦詞紀事</h3>
<p>— 禺山潘老蘭</p>
<p>重陽已負登高約。園林奈他秋晚。叢菊零香。芙蓉賸粉。都入詞家畫稿。柴門曾到。話酒懶琴疏。俊游偏少。醉墨題襟。如今不似當時好。賞音人在何處。天涯飄泊慣。誰識幽抱。汐社書沈。南邨夢杳。問我幾時歸櫂芳尊勸倒任隔水飄燈。逢花側帽。一夕論心。鬢絲重黑了。</p>
<h3>復旦大學生與校役之女結婚</h3>
<p>— 麗青</p>
<p>復旦大學政治學系三年級生吳樹模。四川人。一年前寄宿該校校後宋港巷十號之農家。會有該校第四宿舍茶房徐福寳者。爲便利其服務起見。亦偕其妻若女寄居於斯。徐女十七矣。其秀麗。皮色雖微黑。然絕細膩。性情婉淑。略通書翰吳生年逾弱冠。千里負笈。客舍亦殊感寂寞。有此芳鄰。遂未免有「好逑」之意。相交旣久。遂相愛好。女父母得此奇遇。誠求之不得。因慨然允訂婚約。該校曾轟傳一時。壁報尤無日不登此一對未婚夫婦之消息。海上小報亦曾登載。惜失之不詳耳。</p>
<p>訂婚後。吳即就食岳家。洗滌衣物者全爲岳母所承包。吳女則嘘寒問暖。倍于已婚。同學輩無不稱羨焉</p>
<p>日前吳氏遍發喜帖。定於本月七日於大中華飯店行結婚禮。證婚人爲高一涵先生。介紹人則爲許世英侄子聞。女儐相爲該校四大天王之二。成言方成言嘉姊妹。男儐相爲吳之同學陳東明陳偉觀二君。人材濟濟。一時稱絕。聞二大天王曾各贈與新娘旗袍料二件云。</p>
<p>婚禮純用舊式。行禮亦捨三鞠躬而用三跪九叩禮。吳之岳父母亦修飾若貴家人。受此快婿之重禮。觀禮者全爲大學生濟濟一堂。倍極歡忭。</p>
<p>我國婚姻。素守舊有之「門當户對律」。吳君能廢此惡例。打破階級觀念實足爲現代一般迷戀於階級意識之青年男女所矜式。爰記之以餉自由談讀者。</p>
<h3>清歌妙舞說梅花</h3>
<p>— 微笑生</p>
<p>梅花少女歌舞團。此次於重慶。宜昌。長沙。漢口南京一帶。表演互九月。於月之六日返滬。以在重慶表演時。受漢滬各報遇險之傳說。乃作大規模之公演。一以闢已往之謠傳。二以獻最近之新作。於是少女清歌。青春妙舞。八九十三日。出現於奥迪安大獻院。</p>
<p>愚於八日首塲往觀。因至時較遲。塲内已無佳座。於屋隅得觀「雙宿雙飛。他到跳舞場去了。水手舞。大閙墨水瓶。十里長亭十杯酒。蝶影翩𦒘。游龍戲鳳。七情。」等八折。其中龔秋霞張綺之雙宿雙飛。步伐合拍。舉止如一。殊見美觀。二女士之柔術。當非朝夕之功。可以臻此。秋霞復有大閙墨水瓶一折。滑稽突梯。歌舞兼長。誠人材也。張仙琳之清歌他到跳舞場去。及十里長亭十杯酒嗓音表情。酷肖黎明暉。今黎已退隠。仙琳當可獨步矣。蔡一鳴女士。聞係音樂家蔡問津君之弱妹。富於男性之美。得乃兄之薰陶。作品自是不弱。水手舞。爲舞中之最難討好者。一鳴舞來。好處恰到。掌聲隨起。意中事耳。張綺黄昏之游龍戲鳳。完全表演人體美化之藝術。殊見賣力。大歌舞劇「七情」。聞係魏芸湄蔡問津魏榮波三君之合作品。以全團人材表演之。情節爲反西游記。蓋唐僧過盤絲洞。惑於七情。竟而招親入贅。寗非奇事。龔秋霞張綺張仙琳蔡一鳴徐粲英錢鍾秀翁蘭魂。分飾七情。楊泮。黄昏。孫德嘉三君。分飾唐僧。悟空。悟能。各盡其長。如火如荼。歌舞中之僅見者。而八戒跳舞。尤引起不少笑聲焉。</p>
<h3>南洋游記（九七）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>此問人大抵男女面皆敷粉。其粉粗而黄。或係藥物。不但飾爲美觀也。印度男女眉間常抺一紅線。或點一紅點。殆一種信仰歟。或宗敎歟。女人好吃烟。而中人有用大烟袋者。殊可驚。乃用一大竹竿截三四尺作一小孔。置烟於上而食之。昔者廣西亦見此。今於海外又見之也。</p>
<p>往者西貢等處見牛角甚好。而星洲檳城白牛角均可觀。以爲近印度白牛角必更好。而至仰則但見鈍角白牛。無復如彼處之角矣。角以檳城爲最。各式均有。將來人欲觀白牛角者。務到檳城觀之。勿失機會也。</p>
<p>十一日萬慧師同游金門。訪觀修尼姑所住之唐人廟。甚修潔。齋麵頗好。内住女修士七八人。乃廣東人所薦。此間女修士甚多。男曰齋公。女曰齋婆。觀修曾游日本十年。其在吉隆坡有廟。香港觀音山有廟。勢力頗大。萬慧師正修慧業精舍。乃爲之化緣也。途經一天主堂。乃西人爲華人而設。辦事者天津文與以法文書數本。是日又游白塔。塔乃與大金塔相望之大塔。次於大金。亦有四門。其像大理石甚美。令人羨慕不止。要之佛像之妙。多半爲美人偈也。鄧雪耕云。不如西雕刻之精細。特東方以靜態丰韻勝耳。塔中有缅文圖書館。及占卦者。</p>
<p>塔前遇一修脚者。鍾愚公云。可修脚。只二枚銅元。乃使修。則甚粗略。剪趾甲而已。非如華人之修也。若并翦手指甲則四枚。鍾君言。此另一種印度人。其人家代吃素不茹葷。甚蠢愚。不知算數。故永遠止業爲人修脚。按印度地大種繁。而俗甚怪。有如此者也。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（三三四）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十六回　殷勤問字翠袖謁先生　慷慨談兵青樓宴女傑</p>
<p>所以那時候還是用中國式的木器。最用得起而又好看的。無過於紅木。任憑你用幾十年也不走様子。再加以雕鏤精工。也算是吾國的美術。現在綠漪的亭子間裏。也安放了一張紅木雕刻的牀。其餘也都是紅木器具。左詩晨那天到小花園去。却見綠漪穿了一件是伊的母親給伊新製的櫻花白麗雲緞灰鼠襖兒。也是同様顔色的一條褲子。紐扣上是有茶杯大小的一朶大紅山茶花。往常伊總是打一條辫子的。今天却梳了一個髮髻。頭頂心挿了一剪仙人掌上的紅花。澹英白的鞋子。鞋頭上繡上一對紅色的金魚。中國的色彩。以紅色表示吉祥之意。今天綠漪新舖房間。好似一家商店新開張一般。處處要表示吉利。所以各處都有紅的色彩。鈕子上。髮髻上。鞋頭上。鮮艶使人耀目。而且往常不過薄施脂粉。今天粉擦得分外的白。胭脂抺得分外的紅。眉描小翠。唇點櫻朱。出落得精神别様的風流。左詩晨看見了伊的時候。便道。今天打扮得越發標緻了。綠漪笑吟吟的說道。你看我今天梳了一個頭。不有點兒像小老太婆嗎。左詩晨道。不像小老太婆。倒像一個新娘子。綠漪微微報之以怒目。只見房間裏走出一個中年婦人。年紀看上去。不過三十多歲。手中握着一具水烟袋。含笑着道。這一位就是左二少嗎。那時綠漪便在旁介紹道。這一位便是吾們姆媽左詩晨一看。伊那一位姆媽。雖然年紀不過三十多歲。臉上還敷上一層脂粉。可是在脂粉之中。隠隠顯現出一層青氣。大概是吸鴉片烟的吧。把伊的女兒送入娼門。至少這吸鴉片烟。有密切的關係。一個人吸上了鴉片烟以後。别的事看得很輕澹。而鴉片烟不可不吸。只要一燈相對。凡事都歸平靜。好似入定的老僧一般。甚而至於今天白飯可以不吃。黑飯却不能不早自籌備。爲了鴉片烟是個切身問題。餘事就馬馬虎虎。因又想起伊面上的脂粉。大都也關於鴉片問題。因爲伊要遮住這臉上的烟容。不能不加上一層色彩。無奈鴉片這様東西。眞如古人所說的現於面。盎於背。施於四體。無論怎様也庶蓋不了。左詩晨暗想。綠漪有了這様一位母親。就是使伊墮落的一種途徑了。</p>

<h3>外匯已轉鬆勢</h3>
<p>華商時抛時結···大條或可回長</p>
<p>昨日海外銀市已成異趨　英銀低而美银升、並以花旗初售、後有維持銀價態度、故市面趨穏、英美滙兌均已見漲、神户市平定匯豐持牌各滙除香港减二五計八十兩零五錢外、其餘均無變化惟銀行買進遠期行情略見放長半檔、至於内盤英美日三匯已成反向、乃迭緊後之回鬆也蓋金市漲風平息、惟風浪仍然洶湧、起落無常、終日竟有九兩之差次、曾一度打破六百三十兩大關於是各滙殆亦紛歧、結果較前午計英金長二五、美金長半元、日金跌二分之巨、華商金業中出納各殊、殆金價上騰之際、均向扒結、而下乘時則有抛出、大致以做套頭也、計英金成交二十萬鎊、銀行如和豐·華比、朝鮮·東亞等均有納進、住友·朝鮮·東亞·華比等亦有售出、又各中日等銀行互相成交十餘萬鎊、英美烟公司稍有吸進、又美金各行對做二十餘萬元、而日金交易稀少、僅以大連票由大連帮抛出一百餘萬元、乃三井·住友·朝鮮納進也、殆標金套頭以英金約離開十八兩光景、美金二十四五兩、日金計</p>
<p>二十餘兩、但一般進口華洋各商大受打撃、殆届期貨品不得已照結、虧蝕之鉅不可言喻也昨市似轉萎勢、今天大條或可回漲焉云云、</p>
<p>英滙　内盤竟計一八七五差次、上午十二月出價一先令五便士、三月八一二五、買價照加零六二五、午收十二月出價一五八一二五三月八七五、下午收市十二月出價八七五、三月九三七　買價照加零六二五、</p>

<h3>釐拆輔幣無甚更動</h3>
<p>昨日銀洋輔幣各種市價、以交易稀少、人心怠懈、大都無甚更動而且早午市之價、一致雷同、一若午市不開行情者、然可見市况已成弩末、一切收放欵項類率從事結束、故情形更覺岑寂、逆料此後恐無重要見聞耳、</p>
<p>厘拆價格（洋厘）早午市同爲七錢二分四厘三毫七忽半與前日早市亦復相同、（銀拆）銀根寬鬆、依然如故、早午市同爲七分、劃頭及掛牌均無行市</p>

<h3>紗花紗市跌後抛户稀</h3>
<p>紗市略覺平靜、因大跌之後、新抛户較缺、但世界大勢狀况依然衰弱、美棉三品一致趨跌、所以日商抛賣之念殊深、潮州帮繼續賣出加碼、市上現銷各帮均無久長購買力、前途仍難樂觀、</p>
<p>人標安靜　人標前市開盤、以外棉趨跌、人氣不佳、各跌六七錢、二三盤有一部份执空略漲、結果各月漲跌一二錢、午後聞實銷喑澹、三品紗回跌、日商抛賣、市面稍軟、收盤又跌、全日成交統計一百三千一百包、查賣出公泰九百包、瑞大九百包、達豐六百包、漢豐六百包、其餘三·五·六百包、買進長豐一千包、裕康八百五十包、其餘二·三·四百包、茲將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉市在平正中</h3>
<p>棉市平定、人心尙定、多頭拉力强硬、漢路來源不暢、又滙兌關係故市盤仍堅惟有一部份抛賣心思益濃、目前多空兩方擯持甚烈、現需各廠沉寂、毫無舉動、以後恐有劇烈之變化、</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市步軟</h3>
<p>閘北　昨日裡路來船見到三四十號、本街銷場不一、北粳去化仍呆高貨有店方競進、行木情續定、普通中關問津甚少、因跌兩角外、目今二號高粳祗在十三元關口形勢全視走銷爲定、薄稻續軟一兩角、買氣極靜而來源陸續大勢或再下游未奇、羊秈市銷殊活、划申成本亦重、價格挻定杜秈似有客胃過問、惟頂貨寥落、盤面尙稱平穏、普通高開十二元半左右、埠尖到稀銷佳、初曾微抬、旋買方吃緊而站立、特高仍開十二元關左、變元頂貨仍枯、市交均屬普通之貨市况高定、次跌角半、陰化略疲平庸之態、</p>
<p>滬南　昨日各帮到船二三十號、市銷不化、常錫北粳河下依然缺乏頂貨、故普通及市高交易不惡行情見疲角半至兩角蘇帮各粳零銷尙可、但到存尙厚、無鉅胃去路、價格因轉下落同里粳開十一元半之譜、南路薄稻仍不振銷場呆而交易少、大盤又小角外、羊杜兩尖走銷覺淡到雖不多、市則平疲、變元陰化、去胃呆木、行情均短角左、</p>
<h3>粉市晨跌午回</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、以洋麥報價坎拿大落三四角、芝加哥則無甚上落、又以金市較頂峰稍回致人心帶軟、惟大部份廠家以形勢已佳、大致均主擯守、從事抛售者、實覺奇少、外行之浮空、因恐受軋、亦祗零星、故各月份之差度、較前日祗及二分左右迨至下午開盤初尙平疲、繼以大户空頭、狂補不已、各月份市面又復回振、照此種景象、前途局面、或恐仍轉好象也、結果本月份較前日微小二厘半、正月份小一分、二月份小五厘、三月份小一分、四·五月份小五厘云、</p>
<h3>期麥因補空復俏</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市呈初平繼堅之象當上午初開時以洋麥報價略小、金市又稍回落故開價即爲四兩二錢八分、遠期各月份亦較前日落三四分不等惟至二盤以後因補空頗殷、市復回俏、迨至下午開盤、形勢復緊、本月份空方以所定洋麥、能否如期趕到、尙難確定致買方地位、未免較佳遠期復有大户買進、計有一百餘車之巨、故市氣又見步振、結果本月份較前日收價反好一分、一二月份小一分、三月份不動、四月份大一分、五月份大二分、現麥寂寞已久、昨做開中次襄河麥六百包、價三兩六錢、由信大辦去云、</p>
<h3>糖市糖市漲後轉挫</h3>

<h3>油市油銷漸入停頓狀態</h3>
<p>洪桐油提高抑低　銷塲已呈停頓狀態、本市囤積甚厚、市氣疲憊業中報盤頗有參差、老牌吉盈豐須售二十五兩二錢、慶楊售二十兩一關、雜牌自十七兩至十八兩不等、大勢提高抑低云、</p>
<p>漢柏油到銷兩靜　市象堅定、宋河插雪小數到漢、開盤仍昻至十八兩八錢、蔴城油洋銷沉靜漲風已戢、行售十七兩七錢、本市行盤麻城二十一兩其他按級增加云、</p>
<p>白桐油又見萎象　年關日迫、各洋行均預備結束、辦胃益懈、前途悲觀外盤重復降售十七兩二錢、内盤客盤暫乏更動、</p>
<h3>疋頭塌貨交易大暢</h3>
<p>各價莫不上升</p>
<p>邇來疋頭因金市暴漲不已、定價大好、故有由跌轉漲之象、至昨益見良好、各貨莫不上升、軟落已久之月華絨·黑花絨·水浪絨跌風均息、塌貨交易大暢、連日深色汀·藍條色汀等成交達二千件左右、均屬轉棧待價而沽、南貢呢現貨缺乏、飛漲不已、昨日三潭須三錢六分、司馬相如三錢六分半、一品富貴三錢二分、雙童鹿三錢一分、莫干山雖三錢三分半、現貨尙難購到、三友圖已須三錢零五厘、細嗶嘰昨漲起二厘半至五厘、古城會已開三錢四分半、寳球什色無貨、秃藍灰亦須三錢二分平、湖心亭·歡樂一致開三錢、棉布公會市氣昨已大不相同前所觀望者、現均紛紛購進、行家存貨已呈一空之勢、考其原因、實以定價較現市高起甚巨、是以引起實銷動辦云、</p>
<h3>南北貨普通桂元漸趨活動</h3>
<p>普通桂圓前後存積頗多、各號以銷路不佳、久無開出、行家亦觀望不前、惟邇來客胃雖不多、零星交易尙屬可觀、行存漸薄、故進意轉濃、聞連日成交上中檔貨爲數達三百餘箱、價爲二十三兩至二十兩左右不一、市勢趨定、</p>
<h3>五金英鋼板漲後交益淡</h3>
<p>英鋼板自外匯緊縮之後、本埠同業心思猛見上晋、因此喝盤層層見加、刻市如二厘半每担可估九兩五錢、五厘七兩二錢半、七厘半六兩七錢半一分六兩五錢、分半以上均估六兩四錢、但實際交易反因貨價太昻無人問津是以成交更微、查市場中三四日來除本街造船廠等稍有點綴外、出口客帮均無動情、總觀全市、趨况大有外强中乾之勢云、</p>

<h3>上海藝專成績展</h3>
<p>— 培良</p>
<p>半年來簡直完全成了鄉下人了、躱在江灣一個小里中的樓底下、上海都很少到、又是秋深草衰的時候、連大自然都是沉閣的、但也並不是没有夢想、想在什麽時候能夠投身到藝術的環境裏、能夠接觸到一些美的東西、所以便不能完全安分、有時候會從睡夢中驚醒來、近日同幾個朋友籌備小小演一次劇、也就連跑過上海幾次了、十日這一天、剛從火車下來、恰恰遇到王道源先生、呌我到他所創辦的上海藝術專科學校裏去看一下、我正想借此領略一點藝術的韻味、便同王先生去進了那所新建的校舍、</p>
<p>學校裏正忙着布置第二天的展覽會、滿處堆集着圖畫、有的已經安放好了、有的亂躺在墻脚桌邊、我常有一些偏見、以爲一件已經完成了的藝術品固然最値得我們欣賞、但在這藝術品正在創造完成的程序中、而得身自參加、縱然是旁觀者罷、卻另有一種粗頭亂服之致、足使我們徘徊不能去的、即如我、固然喜觀在池座裏欣賞戲劇之表演、也更喜觀在後台裏工作、這次正在佈置中將圖畫展覽會、所給我的興趣、正和我在後台裏感到的一様、雖我我連釘一個釘子在恰當的地位以掛好畫的工作都不會做、</p>
<p>圖畫藝術我是太外行了、不能夠說什麽話、雖然蒙王先生慇懃指敎、但就一部份已經掛好了的看、也致我驚異其豐富繁麗、繽紛無盡了、八百多點的學生成績中、我僅看過一兩百幅、清新沉着、眞是名師指導之成績、在那裏的一個鐘頭、深深地感到自已是沉浸在藝術的空氣裏了、三兩年的藝術科學生、造詣到這個様子、可以想像他們平日所過的是一種什麽生活、所受的是一種什麽敎育、他們的精神情緒發揚到什麽様子、我忽然羨慕他們這種學生生活、知道開展在他們前面的境域是無窮的、迴溯從前、不禁感慨自已所管的藝術敎育、所能得到的藝術修養是如何薄弱了、繪晝藝術在中國本已稍有道路可遵循、如今王先生又給造出了一座最完美的藝術之宫、從這裏會開放出如何燦爛的藝術之花呵、而我們所工作着的藝術卻遠在黑暗中摸索、又幾時能存像王先生這様的人出來給開闢道路呢、</p>
<p>至於王·陳·關·倪諸敎授先生的近作、放在展覽會中作參考品的、我看過之後、只有崇拜、只有沉醉、又何能贊一詞、</p>
<p>明天在江灣路上、一座新修的建築物、外觀簡單樸實、極調和的色彩顯出單純莊重、那裏面會放出藝術之萬丈光茫、愛好藝術的人應該到那裏面過三個鐘頭、在他們出來以後會有美的夢縈繞着他們的、</p>
<p>（附註）上海藝專成績展覽今日開幕、地點江灣路天通庵附近該校内、（編者）</p>
<h3>日本帝展洋畫巡覽</h3>
<p>— 謝海燕</p>
<p>日本通信</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>同學遠滕君、約我一道到上野公園東京府美術館看帝國美術院第一十回展覽會、看展覽會固然是最合我脾胃的事、但是、漸愧得很、近來窮得連不能不少的郵票也要節省、到東京府美術館去、不但買入塲券的錢籌劃不來、即由西荻窪到上野驛的車錢也有問題在的、我只得用婉詞辭謝他、說我現時很忙、没有法子分身、看展覽會的事、須俟有空時再往、</p>
<p>今天早上、料不到遠滕君會再到我這裏來、他臉上堆滿着笑容、由袋裏掏出兩張入塲卷來、爽爽快快地放在桌子上、</p>
<p>「去吧、入塲卷替你買好了、今天不是星期日嗎、我們就利用這個睛朗的星期日、到會塲裏消磨一天吧、」他懇切地說、</p>
<p>「謝謝、你不是去看過了嗎、」我回答</p>
<p>「還要去看的、但是一個人去太没有意思啦、</p>
<p>「最好拿本書在電車裏看"Atelier"好嗎、」他繼續說、一方面在書架裏替我抽出一本"Aelrie,的雜誌來</p>
<p>像上了年紀的人、齒落髮秃、駝背鳩形的老衰底初冬的上野、再不復如二月前參觀二科展覽會時所見的青葱可愛了、没有紅的花、又没有綠的草、只有那鬆疏的凋零而焦黄的乾葉、還飄搖不定地戀綴在枯骨般的枝椏上、眼鏡池中的噴泉、潇潇地、像凄奏着青春喪殘的哀曲似的、東照宫前好櫻、不忍池畔的柳、也盡換去其娟秀的本來面目了、然而、車馬遊客、倒不因此而減少、這也許是富於磁性的帝展的吸力吧、（未完）</p>

<h3>寫給包君</h3>
<p>— 程碧氷</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>「包君</p>
<p>我這封信算是寫給你的、因爲除了你以外、我便孤獨到没有第二個可以說話的人、這様、我這封信縱不是寫給你的、但是爲了要扯出一個人來算作我寫這封信的對象、也只好用上你的大名了、</p>
<p>和你不見面不過兩三個星期、但是、在這兩三個星期中的我呀、眞是寂寞得可憐、孤獨到可憐、我簡直七八天都没有說一句話的機會了、除了二房東和飯店裏的老板以外、然而他們和我所說的話、是問我何日能夠付清房租飯債、我仍是覺得没有人和我說話才是我的幸福呀、因爲二房東和飯店裏的老板和我說話只有增加我的苦痛而已、</p>
<p>自從和你分别以後、我是什麽事都没有做過、雖然從前曾經和你口頭宣言、「我要努力創作一點東西的、」但是、近來因爲心緒不寗的緣故、我握起筆來是半個字都寫不出呀、</p>
<p>整天的我都是在馬路上徘徊着、作着毫無補益的徒步旅行、用來消遣這冗長的時日、然而結果、我只有賺得滿腔的悲哀喲、</p>
<p>包君、你是知道的、我近來的遭遇、又和三年以前做祈禱的時代差不多了、可憐我身上只穿着一件竹布（或者可以說是自由布）長衫、除了這件衣服以外我是没得第二件衣服可以更換的了、但是、在馬路上看看别人呢、别人家都是穿着漂亮的西裝、偕着美麗的愛人、坐着汽車、出入於電影塲跳舞廳咖啡店、唉唉、他們是多麽的幸福呀、而我呢、我呢、唉唉、包君、我又有什麽能夠向你說的呢、</p>
<p>自從今年三月間由山東回到南方來、我竟做了一個失業者、我竟没有過到安樂的一天、因此、這半年來的我呀、眞是苦痛到極點了、凡是任何事件、都只有引起我的傷心、使我流淚的呀、</p>
<p>唉唉、包君、我這話是不該向你訴說的、我這些文字是多寫了的、像我這様的人、能夠度過一天、那末、那一天算是幸福的了、更何敢說什麽安樂呢、……</p>
<p>然而、包君、我終究也是一個人呀、我終究也是一個青年人呀、我旣然生存在世界上來、那末我當然是有要求種種生的慾求的權利的呀、</p>
<p>一個星期以前、我竟發現了一個在我的眼光中算是最美麗的女人、這女人呀、包君、我不知道你們和她見過面以後的品評是怎様、因爲你根本的就没有和她見面過、但是、我呀、我自從和她見面</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>以後、我的心緒是怎様的也不能夠安靜下來了呀、</p>
<p>哦、包君、我是可以告訴你的、我近來心理確實起了變化、和兩三年以前不同了、也許是因爲年齡的原故吧、也許是因爲身體已經恢復健康的原因吧、我不知怎麽的、我近來、我是深深的感覺到、没有異性的安慰、那眞是寂寞的很、</p>
<p>因爲了這種原因、所以那個女人在我的心中印象是濃厚的很、我覺得她眞是一個美麗的仙女、但是呀、包君、在法國公園裏面、我向她笑笑、她也送給我一個秋波、可是出了法國公園之後呢、她又裝着那種態度莊嚴的様子、我向她逼進一步、她便要逃避我的呀、</p>
<p>唉唉、包君、我那裏有戀愛她的資格呢、我那裏有戀愛她的資格呢、我這人簡直是在做夢、我這人簡直是在做夢、包君、我又是可以告訴你的、她的家庭是在××路一百六十一號、她的父親可不知道是做什麽事件的、但是家庭内僱有男女傭人三四個、雖然没有汽車、但是包車却有兩輛、這様雖不能說是一個資本家的家庭、但是却也算是一個小有錢的人了、而我呢、而我呢、哦、包君、你是知道的呀、我是一個窮措大、我是一身以外無長物的、可憐我居住的這個亭子間、都是三個足月没有付房金了呀、我跑到馬路上去是連坐電車的錢都没有的呀、我還有思念她的資格嗎、可憐戀愛與金錢是勢不兩立的呀、</p>
<p>今年下半年謀事做、謀不到手、當敎員人家也不要、而且因爲自已無名、做文章也被各書局裏拒絕、這様、我只有坐待餓斃的了、不慣於謀生的我、還能說什麽呢、但是、包君、想不到處現在的環境中、我還要非分的生起女人的念頭來、這我自已眞是自尋死路了呀、眞是自尋死路了呀（未完）</p>

<h3>草野社的新氣象</h3>
<p>— 南心</p>
<p>草野周刋大加刷新　陸續出版新書三種</p>
<p>「草野」是國内有力的純文藝周刋、在海上最風行的小刋物中、算是别樹一幟、一般學生份子、差不多没有一個不愛讀的、所以它的銷路、是一期一期的增加、自三卷一號出版了革新號之後、在内容上是力求精美、充實、在文字上更其是打成了一貫、以洗過去那種荒蕪的没有中心思想的舊面目、這是一般愛讀草野者所公認的、因爲它這様的精采有力、所以才能被廣衆的讀者所推崇、就是風行一時的「前鋒周報」、「時代青年」等等、在草野之後幾種異軍突起的刋物、也是這様、當然、現今的新書籍和一般定期刋物、眞是充滿了中的出版界、但是對於文藝有特異旨趣的智識份子、購買某種新書籍或者定期定物的時候、一定經過愼重的精密的選擇、所以有人說、「買書先要看内容、這當然是經騐之談、我相信、一般讀者對於「草野」和前鋒周報」等定期刋物這様熱烈的愛護、無疑地是爲了它底内容充實、在小小的一張刋物上、能夠讀到極形有力的文章、却是値得我們叙述的事、</p>
<p>然而、國内出版界所發行的種種刋物、大都是没有中心思想、有時是熔各種文字於一爐、荒雜得不堪、不問它是傷感的、浪漫的、古典的、以及什麽普羅的、祇要是所謂有名作者的譯著、便把它拉在一起、以招讀者的注目、有的是在盲目的呐喊、以迎合讀者的心理和趣味、這當然不是努力於文化者的正確的態度、在現今的時代潮流中、爲了客觀的需要、是應該確定一種具有中心意識的文藝、這文藝的發揚、就是「前鋒周報」與「草野」等所表現着的、所以、「草野周刋」自三卷一號起在文字上是有了一貫的統一性、而且這種富有向上性的文藝、却給予愛好文藝者不少有力的指示、「草野」能夠得到大多數讀者的歡迎、當然這是最大的原因、由此、我們也可以明白當代的文藝必需具有正確的中心思想、前進的向上的意識、不然的話、這文藝唯有沉淪、以至滅亡、</p>
<p>「草野周刋」、在這第三卷中、至少是已取得正確的中心意識、但是該社同人、還想在内容上力求精采在三卷出完了之後、便着手積極地計劃、以期成爲國内的唯一的純文藝刋物、所以它遲遲未曾出版、使一般愛讀者眞是望眼欲穿、以後在文藝的範疇上、是除了小說·詩歌·散文·對話·隨筆·論文·批評·文壇消息等等種類之外、並注重於學校生活的寫眞、譯述國外名著、短雋合於學校表演的劇本、這些、當然可以使「草野」的内容日漸進展、成爲最完善的一種純文藝的刋物、不過、他們决不迎合低級的趣味、及改變「草野」第三卷所確定下的主旨、同時、文壇消息是以客觀的筆緻來描寫、每期將中國出版界最新頴的消息報告於讀者、當然、這些新的消息是比各種月刋上所刋載的來得敏捷、並且對於各學校中的文藝團體的消息、亦盡量刋載、以期成爲文藝界學生界必讀的刋物、</p>
<p>以後的「草野」、將决定按期出版、無論如何、是不使它脫期、或延期的、每逢禮拜六、各代售處即有出售、在社友及定閱者、更可先期閱讀爲快、撰述人除鄒材、黄奐若、王鐵華、陽增敭等長期擔任之外、並約定邵冠華、楊蔭深、戴行軺、王墳、王一心、羅洪女士、霍振亞女士都良、劉繩武等文藝界名著作家負責撰稿、所以在每期的内容上、一定有新的有力的文字貢獻於讀者之前、對於外間的來稿、祗要是本刋宗旨相合的而且具有新的表現的、我們都儘量的容納、並闢「讀者信箱」一欄、以便接受讀者賜予改進的高見、俾得逐期刷新、所以「草野」在未來、定能在文藝界上放一光明的異彩、這是在我們的意料之中、然而這種力量、還是基於大多數的讀者的肩上、</p>
<p>「草野」是金寬生慘澹經營起來的、除了發行這周刋之外、並出版叢書、最近、又先後出版了三種、一、湯增敭的「姊姊的殘骸」、是一本美的散文集、並有美麗的挿畫多幅、實爲本書增色不少、他是長於寫詩的、用詩的法和情緒來寫散文、那是最耐人尋味的了、所以這書出版之後、差不多每個社友和讀者都人手一册、足見他底詩是極受讀者歡迎的、二金寬生的「婚前小記」、是一本中篇創作、内容大都是作者忠實的叙述、印刷裝訂均極美麗、内附彩色挿圖、更能引起讀者的興趣、三、鄒枋的「香吻」是一首抒情的長詩、冠有趙景深傅東華兩敎授的序文、挿畫亦有數幅、眞的、在沉寂的中國詩壇、鄒君這本「香吻」、委實値得我們的重視、同時、也是國内詩壇上不易多得的一首細膩的抒情詩、至於詳細的内容、後當再加以推薦、草野社對於文化有這様的努力貢獻、値得我們詳加叙述、至於金寬生君慘澹經營的情神、更其是爲其它出版界人物所莫及、關於此、想社友和讀者們都能明瞭的、</p>
<p>「草野」每卷都加以刷新、使一期比一期的有所進展、當然是因爲受了大多數讀者愛護的力量、自四卷一號起、更有一番新的面目、豎横本星期六就要出版的、希望讀者們拭目以待吧、</p>
<p>並且、在這一卷中、擬出版數種專號、甲、創作專號、乙、戲劇專號、丙、詩歌專號、丁、論文專號、戊、小品專號、大概每隔三期發行專號一種、籍以引起讀者的趣旨、總之、今後的「草野」、是具有新的蓬勃的氣象、</p>
<p>四卷一號準於這星期六出版、希愛好「草野」的朋友們注意、</p>
<h3>代泊氏的鋼琴敎授</h3>
<p>— 倜</p>
<p>在人類工作之各種方式中、一種的埋想、有時候被忽視的、是那使努力較易而且較短的單純化、藉以人力可能的最迅速的進步而達到目的、有時候用更科學的方式來應用一個人底力量是比用間接的方式的更大的努力可以更快地得到成就、</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>「代泊方法」代表鋼琴練習的發展中所得的最完滿的進步、這是由路特威格代泊所發展的一種計劃、代泊曾在柏林的國家歌劇塲當過許多年的樂隊指揮、代泊研究偉大鋼琴家底技巧、藉以看出各家底長處確在何處、和那從筋肉上表現出心底衝動的最有效方法是什麽、這是熟悉這件事的人想來都知道的、</p>
<p>代泊、因爲看出人們之不能熟諳鋼琴的技術是全由於缺少筋肉的適應力、所以他的方法底一部份就是一種手指、手、和臂的動作、這種動作是他的學生們在練習鋼琴之外所必須要練習的、他的方法在其於一短時期内集中於幾種動作、這一點、是優於那需要接連幾點鐘地練習着方法的、這種法子的代表就是哈能、他勸他的學生每天要盡量練習、大家現在都知道這種方法是事倍功半、其所得的結果是遠不及經過許多可怕的工作後所應當得到的、</p>
<p>但採用代泊法的學者、卻不論是年輕或年紀較大、總是會覺得他的功課有趣而且常是帶着更清新的心情去迎受新的功課、</p>
<p>這就是代泊方法之秘密、</p>
<p>波赫司烏爾曼先生是一位捷克鋼琴家、曾在德國英國蘇格蘭各地游歷演奏、他的父親是捷克斯拉夫的一位音樂隊指揮、波赫司烏爾曼先生是在十七歲就做了柏拉格聖依格奈雪司大寺底風琴手、他編過幾篇樂曲、並曾替好些的捷克民歌作譜、</p>
<p>本埠的音樂家、對於烏爾曼先底樂曲、「尼羅河之歌」、一篇確有價値的樂曲、很表示注意及欽佩、</p>
<p>一九二○年八月烏爾曼先生與俄國提琴名家蘇爾木司在英國演奏時、八月十四號的「曼却斯特導報」載云、烏爾曼先生是在二十六年之前生於柏拉格、在那里研究音樂、得到樂曲製作底首奬、烏爾曼先生在其本國的地位是很高的、</p>
<p>同年八月十二日的「倫敦日報」關於此事亦云、「烏爾曼先生是一位很出衆的波希米亞鋼琴家」、</p>
<p>經過在上海的四年的工作以後、烏爾曼君願以其工作成績略掇大概、以告社會人士、他所介紹的代泊法的鋼琴敎授很迅速地獲得了認識、而學習此課程確獲成效的學生底人數更足以證明對於此種方法之賞識、這是他所引爲非常欣幸的、他曾從各方面接到了關於此種敎授法的贊奬的話和批評的話、所以其優於他種方法之處是可以無庸贅述的了、</p>
<p>然在上海仍有多數人士從未聽到或知道代泊法所得的實際效果、因此對於此事未加重視、而且往往他們抱憾地回憶到從前自已學音樂時所感的困難、記起了那些天天重覆的「剌激神經」的練習、以及有時候、經過了數年的研究、因灰心而放棄了他們的音樂事業、但有的卻不以自已的前車可鑒、仍使他們的子弟照相同的義方法去從事於音樂底研究、以爲他們從前所受的困難是獲得成功的進步所必須有的、可是、自從他們那時候到現在、音樂敎授法底制度是已經完全改變了、用了今日的代泊法、一個人是可以很容易地讀樂曲、不必要受那用老法子時所費的辛苦、因此就使那用在研究上的時間成爲一種樂趣和一種消遣、而不是一種在最短期間必須完成的可厭的義務、</p>
<p>代泊法代表鋼琴敎授上所發展的最完滿的方法、這並不是一種學說或一套的商業廣告、而是一種用最少的精力去獲得實際結果的科學的方法、這種效果是非採用以前的那種老式敎授法所能得到的、因爲知道爲父母者是竭力要使他們的子女得到最良好的敎導的、所以烏爾曼君誠懇地請注意此事的家長們、以及願使他們的子女受音樂訓練的、到他這敎授所裏來和他面談、同時可以證實學生們在代泊法之下、經過四個月、一年或兩年的時期所得的結果、他們還可以親自問學生們、用這個方法練習時所費的時間、他們所得的回答將表現這個方法所費的時間其百分率是小得可驚的、</p>

Generally, except for the bandit leaders, the rest believe that this kind of burning, killing, and looting policy will never succeed, and they deeply regret it and are willing to abandon their rebellion and surrender. However, they fear that they will not be forgiven and their lives will be difficult to protect, so they are in a dilemma, and they are driven to their deaths by the bandit army and cannot escape, etc. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>

<h3>Negotiations on Extraterritoriality: The United States Proposes a New Plan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Chaoshu telegraphed Beijing on the 10th, reporting that the U.S. government had proposed a new plan for negotiations on extraterritoriality, which is divided into two items: (1) The U.S. government expresses sympathy for the independence of the judicial power of all Chinese citizens, but requests that a gradual implementation method be adopted. Litigation cases between American citizens and Chinese citizens will be handled separately according to the urgency of civil and criminal cases. For civil cases, within the area where the U.S. government has indicated its agreement to abolish consular jurisdiction, they can be tried by Chinese courts. (2) In the interior of China, that is, non-treaty ports, the United States can abandon consular jurisdiction. When there is success, the abolition of consular jurisdiction in treaty ports will be discussed, except for concessions and leased territories with special relations, or as stipulated by treaties. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Recovering Extraterritoriality</h3>
<p>The Central Government Intends to Take Decisive Measures</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In the negotiations on extraterritoriality, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is focusing on actively contacting the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, hoping to achieve satisfactory results in the shortest possible time. However, fearing that various countries will make many difficulties, the Central Government intends to prepare a solid response plan, and ordered the Judicial Yuan to cooperate with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to formulate methods for implementing judicial power over foreign nationals in China. After detailed discussions by the diplomatic group of the Central Political Council this week, it is expected that if the negotiations on extraterritoriality with various countries still have no results before the end of this year, our country will take this decisive measure. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Chonghui and Wang Zhengting had a detailed discussion on the issue of extraterritoriality with various countries and the new U.S. proposal on extraterritoriality at the Judicial Yuan at 3:00 p.m. on the 11th. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>Generals Gu, Chen, and Yang are Preparing to Go to Gansu</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Because the military affairs in the Northwest have been completely resolved, and in order to develop land reclamation and convert soldiers into workers, the Central Government has dispatched the Second Division under Gu Zhutong, the Third Division under Chen Jicheng, and the Tenth Division under Yang Shengzhi, all stationed in Shaanxi, to Gansu. Each unit is preparing transportation vehicles and telecommunications materials. After preparations are completed, they will depart. The Ninth Division under Chiang Tingwen will remain stationed in Luoyang. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shi Zongming and other Gansu citizens in Beijing petitioned the National Government to quickly send strong troops to Gansu to suppress bandits and allocate funds for disaster relief. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>Mo Dehui is Scheduled to Return to China from Russia</h3>
<p>The Committee on the Chinese Eastern Railway is in Progress</p>
<p>(Harbin) Mo Dehui telegraphed, deciding to depart from Russia on the 16th to return to China, requesting instructions on the negotiation policy with Russia. The vacation is scheduled for one month. The plenipotentiary power is delegated to Committee Member Li Chen. The meeting of the Committee on the Chinese Eastern Railway is still in progress. Mo will return to Harbin first, then transfer to Liaoning and go to Beijing. Diplomatic messenger Chuan Zhanwen is scheduled to return to Harbin on the 12th before Mo. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Hu Shize, director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that the Chinese committee members of the second and third groups of the Sino-Russian conference will depart for Russia after Mo arrives in Beijing. As for the issue of recognition agreed upon in Khabarovsk, the Russian side has made considerable concessions. Currently, the goal of our country's negotiations with Russia is still to first resolve the Chinese Eastern Railway as the main body. Because if the Chinese Eastern Railway is not resolved, the Russian negotiations will lack sincerity. Although commercial and transportation are now being discussed at the same time, it is only a preparatory negotiation. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>Conference on Abolishing the Submarine Cable Treaty</h3>
<p>It was Agreed to Abolish the Three Agency Offices</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In the negotiations on abolishing the submarine cable treaty, a continued meeting was held with the Great Eastern and Great Northern Companies on the morning of the 11th. It was agreed that the company agency offices in Tianjin, Yantai, and Shanghai, when the Shanghai-Yantai and Gushui submarine cables are returned, will be abolished. The remaining affairs will be taken over by the local telegraph bureau. Other issues such as the Songhu Baodi cable, the Fuzhou-Xiamen submarine cable, and European quotations were mutually discussed. The meeting adjourned at 12:00. In the afternoon, a meeting was held with the Pacific Commercial Submarine Cable Company, and the issue of sending and receiving telegrams was raised for discussion. The Ministry advocated taking back the self-run business. After a long discussion, no results were achieved. A joint meeting with the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific Companies is now scheduled for 3:00 p.m. on the 12th to discuss the issue jointly. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Sends Personnel to Take Over the Ministries of Agriculture and Industry</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi, after being clearly retained by the government and院, and urged by all parties, has dispelled the intention to resign. Regarding the merger of agriculture, mining, industry and commerce into the Ministry of Industry, it was ordered by the government院 that the affairs of the two ministries be concluded and handed over to the Ministry of Industry by the 10th. Minister Kong has dispatched Zheng Hongnian and 15 others as receiving committee members. The receiving committee members held a meeting on the 11th and elected Zheng Hongnian, Li Yuwan, Chen Feishi, Xu Shanxiang, Guo Gongying, and Yang Shengmao as the main committee members, and recommended Yan Zhuang, Wang Hantao, Liu Yinfuli, Huang Zupei, and Wang Zhong to go to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines for reception, and Zhang Yichou, Cheng Lin, Liu Kuido, Fuganghou, and Chen Zhongsheng to go to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for reception. It is scheduled to start processing on the 12th. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Japan's New Manchuria-Mongolia Policy</h3>
<p>Since the sharp decline in the income of the South Manchurian Railway, Japan has been alarmed by the pressure from China on the South Manchurian Railway, and has been vigorously seeking ways to deal with it. Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs even discussed with the South Manchurian Railway authorities and decided to submit a new Manchuria-Mongolia policy to the Cabinet for discussion, in order to transfer it to negotiations with China. This is also a strange piece of news. The reason for the sharp decline in the income of the South Manchurian Railway is mostly due to the decline in world commerce, and not necessarily due to the impact of China's Beining Railway development plan. Even if it is slightly affected by the development of the Beining Railway, it is a natural policy for an independent country to seek to reorganize China's transportation, plan the joint transportation of various railways in the Northeast, and establish a direction for the development of railway administration. If this slightly conflicts with the interests of other countries, it cannot be called oppression. Moreover, according to Mr. Kambara, director of the South Manchurian Railway, the construction of Huludao Port in China cannot be completed within a few years, and the parallel route with the South Manchurian Railway, such as the Datong Line, is not rich in products and has no major relationship. Although the Jihai Line and the Ninghai Line reduce freight rates, the impact is also minimal. At present, only the Beining Line is slightly affected by the confrontation situation. In short, China's plan to package and encircle the South Manchurian Railway does not feel any pain. The director of Japan's South Manchurian Railway must be familiar with the internal situation of the South Manchurian Railway. What he said is not greatly affected by China's railway policy. Why is it that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has identified it as oppression by China's plan and is eager to deal with China with a new Mongolia-Manchuria policy? The Electric News Agency also said that although the new policy is still based on the Kijuro Shidehara diplomacy of coexistence and co-prosperity, it must depend on how China handles it before making a final decision. Then it is vague. Its suspicious and half-threatening situation is also seen in the words. It is believed that the authorities who improve diplomatic relations with China will not be like this.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Admonition to Students Nationwide</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan received a telegram from Chairman Chiang on the 11th, admonishing students nationwide, and immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Education and the education departments and bureaus of the provincial and municipal governments to instruct all levels of schools under their jurisdiction to abide by it. The text is as follows: In recent years, what Zhongzheng has seen and heard makes him deeply feel that the decline of the academic atmosphere in schools and the rise of student movements everywhere is the greatest crisis and hidden danger for the future of the country. If this is not immediately and strictly corrected, it will be like a flood, and the harm will be endless. Therefore, I sincerely appeal to the young students throughout the country. Young students are excellent members of society and the future masters of the country. At a time when China is waiting for everything to be rebuilt and there is a lack of talent, the party and the country depend on young students to entrust their lives. After completing their studies, they should contribute to society with what they have learned, so that the life of the nation can be sustained forever and the construction of the country can be completed. Today's young students are in this extraordinary era and shoulder an extraordinary and important responsibility. They should be determined to strengthen their aspirations, strive to study, and become useful talents for the upper ranks of the country. Unexpectedly, in various schools, there are many students who waste their studies and are distracted by external affairs, and even are incited by communist bandits and used by villains to secretly form societies, hold public meetings, and borrow names to call on each other, strike and parade to wantonly coerce, use their master-slave base, and use it as a resource for welcome and rejection. Students cannot study in peace, and teachers cannot fulfill their duties. The academic atmosphere is declining, education is bankrupt, endangering the security of the country and undermining the vitality of society. The harm is not only that it can lead to the demise of the country, but also to the extinction of the race. Thinking of this, I am deeply saddened. Our National Government bears the great mission of building the Three Principles of the People</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>The great mission of a righteous country is to cultivate the youth of the whole country, so that they can shoulder heavy responsibilities and achieve great success. As for school discipline, we should strengthen the rectification. Now the academic atmosphere has declined to the extreme. If we do not strictly rectify it, we will not only be unable to face the students who are studying in peace at school, but also the parents and brothers of the young students, and we will not be able to fulfill the responsibilities of the government. Now that the rebellion has been quelled, the military affairs have ended, and the construction undertakings are complex, education is the foundation of the country, and the academic atmosphere is the sign of education. When we talk about construction, we should first focus on education, and when we develop education, we must first correct the academic atmosphere. Zhongzheng has been ordered by the party and the country to also serve as the chief of administration. In the past, he used military affairs to sweep away the demons of the revolution. In the future, he will use civil rule to promote the scale of political training, and vow to improve education and rectify the academic atmosphere as the urgent task. The duties are in the position, and the labor and complaints are not resigned. What I hope is that the young students throughout the country will use their self-awareness and self-reliance, take on heavy responsibilities, and encourage the future, dispel the air of impetuosity, abstain from romantic habits, attach importance to integrity, and be steadfast in learning. Be loyal believers in the Three Principles of the People and the future masters of the Republic of China. Do not be confused by heresies, do not follow divergent trends, distinguish between good and bad, understand right and wrong, respect teachers and protect them, attach importance to academics, and establish people after you have established yourself, and save the country after you have saved yourself. Then you can fulfill your responsibilities to the country and society. If you still follow old habits, are ignorant, act beyond the rules, and speak paradoxically, give up your own responsibilities, and willingly be a tool of reaction, then it is not allowed by school rules and national laws. Those who instigate from the beginning are already inexcusable, and those who blindly follow are also guilty and deserve to be punished. If you use the law to restrain them, what is the use of biting your navel? Success or failure, benefit or harm, I hope you will carefully weigh them. The school disturbances often start with the problem of welcoming and rejecting the principal, or the personal problems of one or two teachers. All of them are emotional impulses, and unscrupulous people take the opportunity to instigate them, so they are often brewed into major changes. It must be known that the principal of the school is appointed by the government, and the professors and staff are hired by the principal. The power and responsibility of the appointment and removal of the principal are in the hands of the government, and the advancement and retreat of teachers are decided by the principal. The government should be cautious in selecting the principal, and the principal should strictly control the actions of the teachers. Principals and teachers all have the powers and responsibilities conferred upon them by national laws. If students arbitrarily oppose the principal, it is tantamount to opposing the government that appointed the principal. If students arbitrarily interfere with the principal in exercising his powers, it is tantamount to destroying national laws. A student movement that opposes the government and destroys laws and disciplines is no different from counter-revolution. The government should strictly stop it and punish it according to law. When Zhongzheng admonishes the students, he should also admonish the principals, teachers, and staff of the schools. The education cause is originally very noble. The cultivation of personality, the refinement of will, the guidance of thought, the exercise of physique, the explanation of science, and the guidance of career choices are all responsibilities that teachers and staff should fulfill to students. It is not purely about selling knowledge. Those who are principals, teachers, and staff should also eliminate competition, cultivate integrity, be honest in their hearts, and be sincere in their work. Eliminate the idea of ​​doors and factions and the strife of factions. Their own character should be enough to be a teacher and a model, and there should be nothing to criticize. The students will have no excuse to stir up disturbances. The principal's sense of responsibility as a teacher and the staff's conscience are essential elements for appeasing student movements and correcting the academic atmosphere. From the current situation in China, education is not yet universal. Entering school is not something that everyone can do. After the soldiers have been raised and the mourning and chaos have ended, material resources are even more difficult. It is still not easy for a middle-class family to let their children study in secondary schools. There are often parents and brothers who reduce clothing and food to provide for their children's expenses. Those who can complete secondary education and advance to higher education are mostly a small number of young people who inherit the legacy of their families and receive special treatment from the country. Therefore, students in universities and high schools are already in an enviable and valuable situation. Young students, with the strength to do something, are in a promising situation. From the perspective of human relations, they should focus on studying as the only prerequisite, so as not to be ashamed of their families, society, and country. From the perspective of the international status, China has not yet reached a state of equality and freedom. Industry has not yet been revitalized, and science has not yet been developed. Internal chaos has been quelled, but external troubles have not stopped. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that the strength of Europe and the United States lies in science. Our party wants to realize the principle of people's livelihood, complete the construction of materials, clarify science, develop industry, and promote China to the modern cultural stage. The responsibility lies with the young students. From the perspective of national power, today's students, at this time of intellectual hunger, should have the spirit of doing one hundred times what others do, and ten times what others do, to study science and catch up, so as to adapt to the urgent needs of the times. Why should they have the energy to engage in external affairs and student disturbances? The government is revitalizing politics and working hard on construction. It gives priority to education and first corrects the academic atmosphere. In the future, it is necessary to quickly distinguish and strictly reward and punish educational administrative personnel. As for educational funds, it is necessary to raise as much as possible and carefully use them, so as to guide the good responsibility of the principal, teachers, and staff, and to train the young students to be obedient. Superiors and subordinates support each other, teachers and students encourage each other, and a good academic atmosphere can be cultivated day by day. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that party members have no freedom, students have no freedom, and officials have no freedom. What we seek is the freedom of the country and the freedom of the nation. What we learn is also to learn for the freedom of the country and the nation. Young students must know that individual freedom and national freedom cannot coexist. If there is individual freedom, there is no national freedom. Then the people become a dish of loose sand, and the country is permanently invaded and oppressed by imperialists. The nation will also be permanently trapped and will never have a day of independence and freedom. Can you not be admonished? In summary, in addition to the Executive Yuan instructing the Ministry of Education to inform all schools throughout the country to inform all students to abide by them, Zhongzheng also sincerely warns them again, based on his consistent aspiration of loving and expecting the scholars, deeply hoping that the students throughout the country will hear the news and rise up, correct their past mistakes, and correct their trends. From the capital to the provinces, counties, townships, and villages, from universities and middle schools to primary schools, there will be no uneducated people and no bad atmosphere. People's hearts will be corrected by this, and society will be safe by this. The future of the party and the country is really dependent on it.

<h3>New Liaison System Established Between Japanese Government and Parties</h3>
<p>Interior Minister Adachi Recommended as the Liaison</p>
<p>The Elders Hope that Shidehara will Act as Prime Minister to the End</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 11 (Den Tsushin) Regarding the matter of acting as president of the Seiyukai Party, the General Affairs Committee was held at the Imperial Hotel yesterday afternoon. After exchanging discussions with Secretary-General Tomita and former General Affairs, the conclusion was that Prime Minister Hamaguchi's progress was good, and that he would be able to carry out the duties of president soon. If a president was appointed as an agent, it would be inappropriate. However, it is necessary to maintain contact and negotiation between the government and the parties during this parliamentary season. It is permissible to set up a liaison system. Secretary-General Sakurauchi was instructed to report this to Foreign Minister Eto, who replied that the cabinet members would have no objections. The General Affairs Committee closed at 4:30 p.m. From 5:00 p.m., a joint conference of cabinet members from the party and party executives was held again at the Imperial Hotel to exchange opinions. As a result, it was decided to set up a liaison officer from the government side for the convenience of liaison with party affairs. Adachi Interior Minister was unanimously recommended as the liaison officer, and the Interior Minister immediately agreed. This issue was resolved satisfactorily. Also, because President Hamaguchi is still ill, it was decided to establish a member balance committee within the Diet. The party recommended former Secretary-General Tomita and Secretary-General Sakurauchi. From the cabinet members, the Interior Minister was recommended, and the Prime Minister's Secretary-General reported on the Prime Minister's progress, saying that it was getting better in the past two or three days, and that the attending doctor was working hard to ensure that he could attend the Diet after the recess. It is expected that he will be able to attend. The meeting adjourned at 8:00 p.m. Although Interior Minister Adachi has been demoted from acting on behalf of the president to being the liaison officer, as a senior member of the Staff Appraisal Committee, he is in charge. Furthermore, Foreign Minister Shidehara is determined to resign as acting prime minister after the Diet is convened. In effect, Interior Minister Adachi has abandoned his title and taken the reality, and has secured a firm footing.</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 11 (Den Tsushin) Seiyukai Party elders Wakatsuki Reijiro, Yamamoto Tatsuo, and Sengoku Mitsugu, based on the results of Yamamoto's separate visit to Prince Saionji, held a secret meeting at Yamamoto's residence the night before. As a result, based on the wishes of Prince Saionji, who said that Prime Minister Hamaguchi had suffered a misfortune due to his duties and could not be in the Diet, a temporary acting prime minister had to be appointed. Shidehara Foreign Minister was persuaded to continue to hold the position. He was then informed of this, but Shidehara's intention to resign was very firm, saying that since he was not a party member, he would not be able to face the party if he failed in this important task. Therefore, he wished to end his days as a diplomat. As a result, the three elders were quite worried.</p>
<h3>French Prime Minister Still Undecided</h3>
<p>President Doumergue Entrusts...</p>
<p>Radical Party Leader to Form Cabinet</p>
<p>Paris, November 11 (Kokumin) French President Doumergue entrusted Radical Party leader and former Algerian Governor-General Steeg this afternoon to form a cabinet. Steeg has agreed to take on the difficult task and will reply to Doumergue on Friday with the results of his cabinet formation. Steeg initially worked as an executive lawyer and professor of philosophy, and entered the cabinet as a member of the Radical Party in 1904. Since then, he has served as a cabinet member in eight cabinets.</p>
<p>Paris, November 10 (Kokumin) The future of the cabinet is still very chaotic. In the parliament, except for Poincaré, no one has been able to gain the support of the majority. If there is no conclusion tomorrow, it is expected that the president will persuade Poincaré again.</p>
<p>Paris, November 10 (Reuters) After the resignation of the French Théo, Bardoux failed to form a cabinet, and former Minister of Labor Raoul Dautry took on the task of forming a cabinet, but it has now been abandoned. A new cabinet has not yet been formed.</p>
<h3>German Unemployed Demonstrate</h3>
<p>Police Open Fire</p>
<p>Hamburg, November 10 (Reuters) Unemployed people were demonstrating, and the police opened fire on them, killing one person and injuring another.</p>
<p>Berlin, November 10 (Reuters) Yesterday, when police drove away demonstrators against the film "All Quiet on the Western Front," Dr. Frick, a member of the National Socialist Party in the Reichstag, obstructed them and was arrested. Dr. Frick has now been sentenced to a fine of 1.8 million marks, or 13 days in prison.</p>
<h3>US Senate Passes US-China Arbitration Treaty</h3>
<p>Washington, November 10 (Kokumin) The US-China Arbitration Treaty, after being reviewed and approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee headed by Borah, was submitted to the Senate. The Senate passed the treaty today. The treaty was officially signed by the two countries in June of this year. The Foreign Relations Committee expressed great satisfaction with it, so it was submitted to the Senate and passed without debate.</p>
<h3>German Newspapers' Comments After the Closing of the Disarmament Preparatory Commission</h3>
<p>Berlin, November 10 (Kokumin) The German newspapers' comments on the Disarmament Preparatory Commission almost unanimously cited the words of American representative Gibson, saying that the four and a half years of work by the various commissioners had produced this deplorable result, and that it was difficult for the various countries to congratulate each other on this. The conservative party's newspaper demanded that the government no longer participate in disarmament negotiations, saying that France was suppressing the defeated countries and hindering genuine disarmament. The British representative had resisted France for many years, but finally softened. What else could be done? The Democratic Party's Vossische Zeitung lamented that the obvious determination of the various countries to evade disarmament obligations only increased international suspicion and would cause radicalism to spread like spring grass. The Central Catholic Party, to which Chancellor Brüning belongs, said in its newspaper, the Germania, that the mask of Geneva had been removed, and that arms reduction had now become a complete deception, not only disappointing all of Germany, but also directly violating the Treaty of Versailles. Germany should also enjoy the same security guarantees as France or other countries. Furthermore, when Germany attends the final disarmament conference in the future, the path will be full of thorns. Since the British are inclined towards France, it is even more difficult to expect other countries to speak up for Germany. Even Italy has joined the ranks of militaristic countries, maintaining a reserve system and refusing to limit it. Others can be imagined. Now that the Disarmament Commission has clearly declared war on genuine disarmament, the only aid left to our country is the rights enjoyed by our people in the Treaty of Versailles and the responsibility to seek genuine disarmament.</p>
<h3>British Railway Union Demands Wage Increase</h3>
<p>London, November 10 (Reuters) The managers of the various British railway companies met with the council of the Railway Union in London today to discuss the union's demands for improved wages and working conditions. The contract signed by both parties two years ago will expire on November 13 this year. The managers of the four major British railway systems proposed to the union to reduce wages, while the union requested a wage increase. After today's meeting, the railway companies stated that they could not agree to the union's demands. The union representative said that the wage increase request must be submitted to the Central Wages Board for review. It is expected that wages will be considered for this dispute on December 19. According to company sources, the company has submitted the wage reduction request to the Wages Board.</p>
<h3>Japanese Authorities Confer on New Policies for Manchuria and Mongolia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, November 11 (Den Tsushin) Regarding the Chinese side's suppression of the South Manchurian Railway (SMR), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, the Ministry of the Army, and the heads of the SMR held a conference. The result was a decision that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would renegotiate with China. The negotiating policy is that the SMR is the lifeline of Japan's special position in Manchuria and Mongolia. If the Chinese side is allowed to suppress it, it will threaten the survival of the Japanese people, so Japan cannot remain silent. However, Japan does not oppose the entire Northeast Railway plan of the Chinese side and hopes for the economic development of the four northeastern provinces. It does not want to propose proposals that would hinder Chinese economic activities. It holds the principle of coexistence and co-prosperity, seeking the prosperity of both the SMR and the Chinese railways. Through negotiations between China and Japan, concrete measures will be studied. Through mutual concessions and coordination, peaceful development of Manchuria and Mongolia will be sought. If the Chinese side does not show sincerity and continues to violate treaties or agreements, the problem will affect the lives of the Japanese people, so it must be prevented. There are also preparations to express Foreign Minister Shidehara's final determination.</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 11 (Den Tsushin) Because the Chinese side is suppressing the South Manchurian Railway, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, together with SMR President Sengoku, Director Kimura, and the Army Affairs Bureau, is discussing countermeasures. It has recently decided to submit a new Manchurian-Mongolian policy to the cabinet for discussion and move it to negotiations with China. The fundamental aim of this new policy is still to develop Shidehara's diplomacy, which focuses on coexistence and co-prosperity. However, depending on how the Chinese side handles the matter, the final decision may be made.</p>

<h3>Belgium to Increase Import Sugar Tax</h3>
<p>Brussels, November 10 (Reuters) The Belgian House of Representatives today passed a bill to increase the import tax on sugar and reduce the domestic sugar production tax. Also, the Sugar Congress is meeting here today. Chadbourne claimed that Javanese sugar growers had agreed to reduce exports, and asked other national representatives to adopt restrictive measures. He advocated that each delegation should each send two people with a view to reaching a consensus on general grounds. Chadbourne also suggested organizing two committees to collect world statistics and consider methods for promoting stocks, and to establish a permanent committee to meet quarterly to monitor the implementation of the convention and to study methods of expanding world consumption. In addition, a basic propaganda fund should be established to increase world sugar consumption. Today, the German representative announced his intention to increase the annual export limit of German sugar from 200,000 tons to 800,000 tons.</p>

<h3>Decline in Business of British Shipping Companies</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th: At the annual meeting of the British Steamship Company, Chairman Yin Zhikai stated that the business situation was deteriorating, worse than anything seen in recent months. Disturbances in India, the situation in Australia, internal strife in China, and the sharp drop in the price of silver all had a significant impact on the shipping industry. As of October 1st this year, 368 British ships, totaling 885,000 tons, were idle. The outlook for the shipping industry is not optimistic. In the past year, the company's ships traveled 750,000 miles less than the previous year, carrying one million tons less cargo and 50,000 fewer passengers. Yin Zhikai concluded by saying that taxes and production costs urgently need to be reduced.</p>

<h3>US President Vigorously Fights for Unemployment Relief Funds</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 10th: President Hoover seems to be on the verge of declaring war on the short-term Congress. According to sources close to Hoover, he will use his veto power to fight for the allocation of funds for unemployment and drought relief, not exceeding the limits originally set in his proposal. Furthermore, he will not back down from Congress on the issue of political expenses. If necessary, Hoover may veto all bills passed by this session of Congress. It is reported that Hoover criticized Congress yesterday for the two bills allocating funds for unemployment and drought relief because the amount set in his proposal was $150,000,000, while the amount currently set by Congress exceeds $500,000,000. The information from Hoover's circle is based on this matter.</p>

<h3>Wuhan Garrison Command Executes Eight Important Communists</h3>
<p>More than 300 Symbols Welcoming Chiang Kai-shek Confiscated</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondent: The Wuhan Garrison Command, in anticipation of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's upcoming inspection tour from Nanjing, has intensified its efforts to prevent communist activities. On the 7th of this month, the Investigation Department of the Garrison Command cracked down on an important communist organization on Shifu Road, capturing three important figures: Liu Guang, Luo Debao, and Liu Dai-shi. They confiscated more than 300 welcoming badges made of red silk, similar to those issued by the Wuhan Welcoming Committee for Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, as well as reactionary declarations and important plans. Considering the severity of the case, the Garrison Command conducted a detailed investigation. Liu and the others confessed without hesitation. Subsequently, Zheng Hanxian, Li Yunda, Wang Heming, Wang Fushan, and Chen Zhengjia were also arrested and confessed to their conspiracy. According to investigations, the communists planned to organize a 40-member pistol team and a 40-member bomb squad. The remaining 220 members would wear symbols welcoming Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and, after Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Hankou, infiltrate the crowd and cause chaos. After interrogation, the Garrison Command, while continuing to order its subordinates to strictly investigate and arrest the remaining members, executed all eight captured individuals on the 10th. The indictment is as follows: "According to the Investigation Department of this Command, the following important accomplices have been apprehended: Liu Guang, Luo Debao, Liu Dai-shi, Zheng Hanxian, Li Yunda, Wang Heming, Wang Fushan, and Chen Zhengjia. Multiple copies of reactionary declarations and important draft plans were confiscated, and more than 300 silk symbols used to welcome Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek were found in the residences of Liu Guang, Luo Debao, and Liu Dai-shi. All were submitted to the department for interrogation according to the law. During the trial, Liu Guang confessed that he, along with Luo Debao and Liu Dai-shi, were under the direction of a Hankou District Committee instructor and were in charge of the mimeographing organization. Zheng Hanxian confessed that he was sent by the Communist Party Central Committee to Hankou to serve as a member of the Wuhan Municipal Committee and to be in charge of propaganda work. Li Yunda confessed that he served on the Hankou District Committee and was responsible for organization. Wang Heming confessed that he served as the secretary of the Hankou District branch. Wang Fushan confessed that he served as the temporary secretary and transportation worker of the District Committee. Chen Zhengjia confessed that he was originally a member of the Shanghai Municipal Committee and was transferred to serve as the secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee in June of this year. All of these confessions were undeniable, and communist defectors testified in court that Liu Guang and Luo Debao were ordered by higher-level communists to infiltrate the crowds in the near future and launch a riot. After repeated investigations, the suspects all readily admitted their guilt without fear. Their crimes are extremely serious and punishable by death according to the law. To deter others, they are hereby sentenced to be executed by firing squad after confirming their identities and being escorted to the execution ground. This notice is hereby publicly announced. Liu Guang is 28 years old, from Hunan. Luo Debao is 32 years old, from Hunan. Liu Dai-shi is 18 years old, from Hunan. Zheng Hanxian is 25 years old, from Fujian. Li Yunda is 25 years old, from Zaoyang. Wang Heming is 20 years old, from Huangpi. Chen Zhengjia is 26 years old, from Yangxin. (December 10th)"</p>
<h3>Communist Prevention Situation in Various Places in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Three More Regiments Added to Beijiang's Strength</p>
<p>Minzhong Defense Army Contacts to Defend the Border</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondent: Recently, local military and police in Guangdong Province have been actively suppressing communists and widely dispatching informants to investigate and arrest Party members in various places in order to suppress the outbreak of unrest. A communist, Li, formerly a Red Guard captain who led a team to operate in Huangsha during the Guangzhou Uprising, was detected by the Provincial Public Security Bureau's Hong Kong detachment. After the suppression, Li fled to Hong Kong and Macau, where he continued to gather Party members and secretly set up an organization in Hong Kong, intending to go to the mainland. The incident was revealed and he was arrested by the Hong Kong government, and a number of reactionary propaganda items were seized. A total of eleven Party members were sentenced to two months' imprisonment and deported after their terms expired. Upon learning of this matter, the Hong Kong-based detectives immediately telegraphed the province requesting more detectives to be dispatched to the ferry ports of the Siyi region to track down and arrest them. After Li and two other Party members, Mao and Liang (female), were released in Hong Kong, they took a Hong Kong Qidu ferry back to Zhongshan. The Hong Kong-based detectives were already following them. As soon as Liang and the others landed at Shiqi, Zhongshan, they were arrested by detectives and police. The three men and women were taken to the Renliang District Public Security Sub-bureau and then escorted back to the Provincial Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The two women were both seventeen or eighteen years old, while the man was older. Given that bandits and communists in Jiangxi and Hunan are scattering southwards and Guangdong's border defenses are of utmost importance, in addition to transferring Wang Dinghua and Tan Langxing's two regiments to Shaoguan and Nanxiong for defense, the province recently transferred Yan Yingyu's regiment of the 63rd Division from Guangxi back to the province to reinforce the defense in Beijiang. In Dongjiang, General Xiang Hanping has dispatched Zhang Da's brigade to Xingning, Luogang, Heping, and Heyuan to suppress bandits, joining forces with Yang Yuting's regiment under Zhang Zhen's command in Fujian Province to defend the border between Fujian and Guangdong. Zhang Zhen recently sent a representative, Long Sihe, to Guangdong to discuss measures to prevent bandits in Fujian and Guangdong with the authorities. It is said that progress has been made and he will return to Fujian soon. It is reported that the Guangdong authorities will provide the Fujian army with some military supplies to help each other suppress communist bandits entering the territory. (December 1st)</p>
<h3>Jiaozhou Bay Farmers Destroy Salt Bureau</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondent: Since the establishment of the Salt Affairs Bureau in the Jiaozhou Bay area, the local people have repeatedly opposed it. During the rampant era of the Big Sword Society in the 17th year of the Republic, the society surrounded the Maggezhuang Salt Bureau to protest salt affairs, resulting in a major case of loss of life, with more than 30 police officers being brutally killed. Therefore, many salt affairs personnel were afraid to go there. Last month, Che Zhongrun, a fisherman from Yin Island, falsely used the name of the Fishermen's Association to gather people to oppose the salt bureau, intending to stage a second tragedy like the Maggezhuang incident. Fortunately, the authorities detected it early and arrested Che Zhongrun and punished him according to the law, preventing an accident. However, just when one wave had subsided, another arose. Recently, a wind of opposition to salt affairs has occurred in the Tiegezhuang area of Jimo. It is said that the reason is that since Liu Qian, the Qingdao-based official of the Shandong Salt Transport Office, took office, he has been working hard to rectify salt affairs, and the chief of the anti-smuggling team, Director Cheng, has also been working diligently. The salt affairs tax revenue in the Jiaozhou Bay area has improved significantly compared to before. The residents of the Tiegezhuang area of Jimo, unable to find loopholes to steal and smuggle salt, used the name of the Ji Du Association to gather members and spread propaganda everywhere to resist the Salt Bureau. On the one hand, they joined forces with dozens of people to destroy the Nanwan Salt Affairs Bureau the day before yesterday, and the doors, windows, and glass were broken. Fortunately, the staff had hidden beforehand and no loss of life occurred. The bureau has now reported the incident to the Qingdao office, requesting instructions. (December 10th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Abducts Our Ministry of Agriculture Commissioner</h3>
<p>Geological Technician of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines</p>
<p>Abducted by Russian Army in Manzhouli</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondent: Wang Hengsheng, a technician from the Investigation Institute of the National Government's Ministry of Agriculture and Mines, was recently abducted by the Russian army on the border of Manzhouli and has not yet been released. The incident occurred as far back as November 17th, but the Manzhouli authorities only found out on the 4th of this month. It is reported that on November 17th, Wang Hengsheng, along with the Dong mining engineer of the Beipiao Coal Mine, was inspecting the geology in the northwestern wilderness of Manzhouli, accompanied by a servant and two guards from the Lubin County government. They were following the Zhalannuoer coal seam, searching for the Zabaigaer Prefecture around Xiaozhan, 18 miles outside the Manzhouli border. Because they were only focused on investigating the geology, they did not pay attention to the Russian guard posts. As dusk fell, they lost their way and mistakenly crossed Xiaozhan, 18 miles away, and were captured by Russian sentries. The five people were arrested together. That night, they were detained in the barracks of Xiaozhan, 18 miles away. The next day, they were escorted to Dauli and then transferred to the headquarters of the Soviet Far East Military Region in Chita without interrogation. After interrogation by the military judge, geological maps, photographic equipment, and two guards' guns were found on Wang and the others. They were accused of being military spies from our side. Wang and the others told the truth, but the Russians did not believe them and imprisoned them in the Chita military prison. They were given three slices of black, coarse bread and a bowl of clear water each day and forced to sweep snow and transport coal as coolies. It was not until the magistrate of Lubin County, Qi Zhaoyu, learned of the information this month that he personally negotiated with the Russian consulate in Manzhouli, requesting their release. The Russian consul gave vague answers, and negotiations with the headquarters of the Far East Military Region in Chita also yielded no results. The magistrate then telegraphed the provincial government to ask it to inform the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines in the capital to negotiate, and on the other hand, telegraphed the office of our plenipotentiary representative to the Sino-Russian Conference in Moscow, requesting Galakhan to demand the release of the border. Soviet Russian merchants and citizens enter our territory with extreme freedom, but when our merchants and citizens enter their territory, they are accused of being military spies. At best, they are whipped and imprisoned, forced to do hard labor; at worst, they are shot and their bodies are abandoned in the wilderness. There has been no news of Technician Wang and the others for nearly a week, and it is not known what their situation is like. (6th)</p>

<h3>The Perilous Poison of the Soviet Union's New Economic Policy</h3>
<p>Report on Current Situation from the Heihe Consul</p>
<p>Feared by Many Countries in Europe and the West</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondent: Since the Soviet Union implemented the New Economic Policy, the internal situation has been kept strictly secret. Recently, the provincial authorities received a detailed report from Quan Shien, the Consul General in Heihe, stating that the ruthlessness of its tactics is sufficient to cause world unrest. Excerpts are as follows: "When I first arrived in office this summer, I saw that the general living conditions of the society were such that food was extremely scarce, everything was expensive, and working people were issued a booklet by the government, which they used to purchase food and other items from state-run stores every day, distributing food according to the number of people. It was extremely difficult. I thought that after several years, the Soviet Union must have become so poor that its policy had failed, without a doubt. However, after a detailed investigation, I realized that the facts were very different. Since the Soviet Union implemented the New Economic Policy five years ago, its domestic industrial, commercial, and agricultural enterprises have been reorganized and have specific organizational structures. In rural areas, there are agricultural cooperatives, and in cities, there are various industrial groups. They are implementing agricultural, industrial, electrical, and automotive modernization, progressing steadily and achieving remarkable results. The output of agricultural, industrial, and mining products is on the rise, but the general living conditions of society are not as abundant as before. This is because the Soviet Union's method of promoting world revolution has abandoned its old strategy of buying with money and is instead using a plan to disrupt world commerce with goods. Therefore, it has adopted a distribution method for various domestic products, except for retaining the necessities of life for the people, which are distributed according to the population of each region. The rest, such as cloth, oil, coal, timber, food, fish, hardware, and industrial products such as canned goods and cigarettes, are exported as much as possible. With the exclusive operation of a country, abundant capital, low cost, and the backing of politics, it competes with the private capital under the free trade system of various countries. Regardless of whether it intentionally resists or sells at a lower price, it is by no means something that private capital can compete with under normal circumstances. Therefore, in recent years, Russian goods have been transported and sold to countries in the East and West, almost everywhere. Recently, ports in Shanghai, Harbin, and other towns along the border of our country are no exception. In the future, as the sales of Russian goods expand and the economies of various countries become more disordered, there will be more unemployment. Its second step is to take the opportunity to carry out its work of promoting and advocating, and I am afraid that it will cause no less than world unrest. The current policy of the Russians is more dangerous and poisonous than relying solely on the magic of money in the past. Now, many countries in Western Europe have realized the depth of their intentions, such as the United States, France, Germany, Belgium, and other countries, which have also implemented measures to ban Russian goods from entering their borders. Our country borders Russia and bears the brunt of the impact. If we do not pay close attention to it in the future and find ways to resist it, I am afraid that the harm it will cause will be even more endless. Since the Red Party is inherently treacherous, ignoring it at the beginning will surely lead to regret in the end. As for the problem of food for the people in its territory, in the past, the Far East area had a large area and a sparse population, and there were many wastelands. Since the implementation of the New Economic Policy five years ago, it was originally planned to immigrate one million people from European Russia to Siberia and various places on the East China Sea coast within five years. In the past two years, more than 100,000 people have been immigrated every year, with the government designating locations, providing horses, seeds, and various machines and agricultural implements, and engaging in reclamation. Therefore, the deserted and remote areas of the past have now become fertile and prosperous towns. The Berkeley had a military factory in the past, but now it has been completely transformed into agricultural implements, such as fire plows, vehicles, hoes, and various machines for cultivating, harvesting, rolling, and crushing, all of which are self-made and do not need to be purchased from other countries. Therefore, its reclamation results are exceptionally advanced. This year, the weather in Russia was favorable, with rain evenly distributed. Small wheat in the Far East all had good harvests. Even the amount produced in the Amur region is sufficient for the needs of various places in the Far East. In addition, the amount of rice produced in Xingkai Lake this year is also huge, so the matter of relying on Chinese food in the past is no longer a problem. However, because it implements a distribution method for food for the people and exports it to foreign countries as much as possible, it is suddenly seen that the living conditions of society are thought to be insufficient, but its political function is different and cannot be understood by those who are superficial. As for the report that the Soviet Union imports a large amount of wheat into China, there has been no confirmation of this here. Because the Soviet Union hides everything and it is not easy to investigate, the National Defense Bureau's inspection is particularly strict. Anyone who wants to investigate its internal situation, regardless of whether it is related to politics or not, is regarded as counter-revolutionary. Therefore, it is quite difficult to get the truth. However, judging from the current policy of the Russians and the large amount of wheat and buckwheat flakes that have recently been exported to Belgium, the report is not without reason, but there is currently no certainty about this issue."

<h3>Overseas Chinese Request Reduction or Exemption of Passport Fees</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Requests National Government to Order Handling</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese believe that the "Provisional Measures for Overseas Chinese Returning Home and Leaving the Country for Obtaining Passports" announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs impose too heavy a burden, making it difficult to implement, and are requesting reductions, exemptions, or improvements to alleviate the difficulties faced by overseas Chinese.

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Details of the Lake Bandit Raid on Tong'anqiao Town: Tong'anqiao Town, located about three li from Huguan in the county, has a total of forty to fifty shops and households. The soybean cake and rice businesses are the most extensive. The town has tight defenses, with a security corps, a commercial corps branch, the First Police Station of the Fourth Public Security Bureau, county police, and a detachment from the Seventh Team of the Second Water Police District stationed there. Lake bandits have repeatedly coveted the town, but have not dared to enter due to the thorough defenses. Around 4 p.m. on the 10th, four or five newly formed bandit boats, with about fifty or sixty bandits carrying two handheld machine guns and dozens of rifles, arrived menacingly from Xiaogong Mountain in Taihu Lake, entered Dongzhukou, and then reached Tong'anqiao Town. Under the command of the bandit leader, they docked and swarmed ashore, first firing a volley of shots and then surrounding the security corps. At that time, Zhu Zuozhou, the security corps instructor, led his team to resist the bandits, but they were outnumbered. Instructor Zhu was shot in the abdomen and then the bandits looted all four Type 79 rifles and ten Linmingdun rifles from the security corps. After obtaining the firearms, the bandits dispersed to search and loot various shops and households. At that time, Yang Zhiming, the patrol officer of the police station, led the police to protect the area. The bandits ordered Patrol Officer Yang to act as a guide, but Yang refused. The bandits then opened fire on Yang, hitting him in the hands and feet, causing him to fall to the ground unconscious. Seeing that Patrol Officer Yang was injured, the bandits went to the Li surname kiln, Yutai Soybean Cake Shop, and other shops and residences to loot for about an hour. All the merchants in the town were spared. At the time, they cut off the long-distance telephone line of the Construction Bureau. After obtaining the loot, the bandits boarded the boats. Before leaving, they kidnapped the injured security corps instructor Zhu Zuozhou, the commercial corps director Li Qianqing, the Yutai Soybean Cake Shop owner Zhang Shunbao, the Jindetai Southern Goods Store owner Jin Peizhi, the Xiaojing Goods Store owner Zhu Zhaoyu, the small hotel owner Zhou Shuiquan, the Tong'an Elementary School Principal Wang Jianzhong, teacher Li Shuxun, and a cook from the police station, a total of ten hostages. They also commandeered two civilian boats. The bandits then exited towards Dongzhu and entered Taihu Lake. That night, the police station in the town telegraphed the Huguan Fourth Branch Bureau. Li Youguang, the branch chief, upon receiving the urgent report, immediately telegraphed the County Public Security Bureau. In addition, he personally led nineteen police officers to pursue the bandits. Shao Xiaogong, the director of the county bureau, upon receiving the telegram, immediately requested the county police team to order Wei, the leader of the Fourth Detachment, to lead his team to the countryside that night. Furthermore, Shen, the director of the Third Public Security District, ordered Inspector Jiang Shuzhang and Team Leader Pei of the Eleventh Team on the morning of the 11th to lead seven patrol boats to Dongzhu, regardless of jurisdictional boundaries, to jointly pursue and suppress the bandits. Around 10 a.m., they learned that the bandits had released four poor hostages, including Zhou Shuiquan, midway. The bandit boats then fled to the vicinity of Xiaogong Mountain in West Taihu Lake. The land and water police teams, after receiving the report, immediately split up and surrounded and suppressed the bandits. Upon reaching the area, the bandits had already fled, and only one abandoned bandit boat and two bullets were found.</p>

<p>Three Bandits Captured in the Xiaofeng Lane Kidnapping Case: On September 23, the home of Feng Yunsheng, the deputy chief of Shuiqu Village in Xiaofeng Lane near Outangshu in the Fourth District (Kaiyuan Township), was robbed by more than ten bandits who scaled the walls and entered the house, causing a loss of more than a thousand yuan. Yunsheng's young son, Yuequan (15 years old), was kidnapped. Afterwards, the bandits sent a letter demanding a ransom of 10,000 yuan. The victim sent Li to negotiate with the bandits, and the price was eventually reduced to 6,500 yuan to redeem the hostage Feng Yuequan, who returned home on the 1st of this month. It is now known that Qian Tianxiong, the captain of the county police team and water patrol team, received a tip-off the other day, saying that the bandit Ding and others who kidnapped Feng Yuequan were hiding near Hutai Town in Fuan Township. Captain Qian, upon receiving the report, immediately led the detective team leader Liao Dajin, detective Hua Yaoxian, and others to the countryside to arrest them at the address provided. Three people were captured on the spot and escorted to the city yesterday, where they were sent to the brigade headquarters.

Deserters Opened Fire and Resisted Arrest at Xueyanqiao Bridge: The Qin Village coast near Xueyanqiao Town, bordering the border of Wuxi and Changzhou, is located on the shore of Taihu Lake in a strategic location. Unexpectedly, at 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, seven people wearing ragged uniforms and resembling deserters suddenly emerged from the direction of Lugang Mountain, carrying firearms, and lingered there. Upon seeing this, the villagers immediately reported to the Xueyanqiao Town Commercial Corps, which dispatched a team to arrest them. Unexpectedly, the deserters hid in the reeds and opened fire to resist arrest. The commercial corps members also opened fire in retaliation. The residents in the area, upon hearing the gunshots, were all terrified. The commercial corps and the deserters engaged in a fierce battle for about a quarter of an hour. The deserters, unable to withstand the attack, fled in disarray. Three deserters jumped into the lake and swam away, their whereabouts unknown. The remaining four deserters also intended to swim away, but seeing a small boat passing along the lake, they opened fire and ordered it to stop and come ashore. They jumped onto the boat, crossed to nearby Majishan, and then immediately transferred to an empty boat parked by the mountain and sped away.</p>

The Chengxi Qianzhuang refused to do business with them, causing a shortage of funds and a halt to pawning. The shareholders hired Lawyer Zhuang Zenghu, represented by He Shousen and Pan Liyi, to file a complaint with the county accusing Jiang and others of embezzlement, and filed a private suit. The court opened on the 9th for interrogation. Because the defendant was hiding in Shanghai, detectives were immediately dispatched to Shanghai, and Jiang Xiangxian was arrested in Qingyang. Cao Zhifu was detained in the Shanghai French Concession by the detective team and French police who went to Shanghai for assistance. On the afternoon of the 10th, Judge Yang opened the court for interrogation.

<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Current Situation of Education: After the death of Ge Meicun, the principal of the County-run Zhapu Elementary School, the position of principal was recently temporarily filled by Zhu Ming, a teacher at the school, by order of the County Education Bureau. It is rumored that the successor for the next semester will be Wang Rongfang. Pan Zhen, the principal of the urban Ti Yun Elementary School (formerly the Shuying Girls' School), applied for leave from the Education Bureau due to illness. Now that the leave has expired and her health has not recovered, she has submitted a request to the county government to resign. It is rumored that the position of principal will be succeeded by Xia Pingfang. Since the dismissal of the principal of Dongguan Elementary School, there has been a great deal of undercurrents. It is rumored that Ding Jinwei, a teacher at the school, will be appointed to fill the position. Furthermore, the county government yesterday appointed Gao Tianyi, the principal of the Rural Central Elementary School, to concurrently serve as the director of the Xinxi Village Public School and has already issued a letter of appointment.</p>
<p>Qian Yinhe Kidnapped and Released: Qian Jinfu, a farmer in Xincang Southwest Township, is from a relatively well-off family and has long been coveted by bandits. Qian had heard the rumors and had moved to the Shanghai area during the summer. Recently, he sent his younger brother Yinhe to the countryside to collect debts. The bandits mistakenly identified him as Jinfu and kidnapped Yinhe, subjecting him to severe torture. Later, they realized that they had made a mistake and that Yinhe's family was impoverished. Yesterday (the 9th), they sent Yinhe back and gave him five silver dollars, but instructed him to quickly notify his brother in Shanghai to remit 500 yuan as soon as possible, otherwise they would set fire to his house.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Agricultural Department's Measures to Alleviate Cheap Grain Prices: The Agricultural Department believes that the most oppressive period for the rural economy is winter. At this time, the market supply exceeds demand, and grain prices will inevitably fall. Farmers, eager to sell their goods for cash, know they will lose money, but they have no choice but to rob Peter to pay Paul. The suffering is unbearable. Previously, Changshu, Wuxi, and other counties had piloted agricultural product storage cooperatives in various townships. Although the promotion was not widespread, it had already achieved results. This year, a bumper harvest was fortunately obtained. If there are storage cooperatives to provide farmers with the convenience of loans, there will be no need to rush to sell grain in winter. The new grain in the market will not be congested. The grain price can be maintained in balance, and society can still regulate the surplus. If this can be done in good faith, it will not only relieve agricultural distress, but also greatly benefit local stability. Therefore, the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank's regulations on warehouse storage and mortgage in the Third District Branch and the interim measures for storage and mortgage in the Sixth District Branch were copied and sent to various counties, ordering the cooperative business instructors to earnestly promote agricultural product storage cooperatives to alleviate agricultural distress.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Dispute Arising from a Misunderstanding in Arresting Bandits: Xie Chengzhai, a well-known owner of a fragrance powder business, lives in Xuejia Lane in the city. A year ago, he was threatened many times. Subsequently, the Public Security Bureau arrested and sentenced the main perpetrators to three to four years of imprisonment. Unexpectedly, Xie received a threatening letter the other day demanding 500 silver dollars, instructing him to send it to the incense burner in the Yangxiang Tudimiao Temple. After receiving the letter, Xie immediately secretly reported to the First Public Security Branch Station. Yang, the patrol officer of the station, selected several plainclothes police officers, carried weapons, and went to wait near the lane at the appointed time. It happened that Liu Yuchen's dyeing workshop in the lane saw a large number of plainclothes men patrolling repeatedly, suspected they were not good people, and did not dare to speak out. They tightly closed the double doors and had the workers climb the roof on ladders to observe the movements of the visitors. The plainclothes police, seeing people on the roof, also suspected they were bandits and opened Liu's door. Liu himself was not at home at the time. They then took his wife and three workers to the station. At this time, the police thought that the bandits had been caught and that they could go to the bureau to claim credit. Liu's wife and the workers thought they had fallen into the hands of bandits and did not dare to struggle. When Liu Yuchen returned home from outside and rushed to the station, he realized it was a misunderstanding. He released all the men and women who had been arrested. Liu originally intended to seriously negotiate with the station, but was persuaded by many people to drop the matter.</p>

The robbery lasted for four hours, and they finally fired a shot and fled. The losses are said to be enormous.</p>
<p>Chief of Public Security Section Interrogated in Opium Case: Li Ruomeng, the chief of the Third Section of the County Public Security Bureau, was smoking opium at the home of Xiaoyazi, a prostitute in the northern part of the city, yesterday afternoon at 6 p.m. The Police Brigade Headquarters learned of this and dispatched Peng Shiliang, a messenger, to lead a team to arrest him on the spot.

<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Police Team Killed a Bandit: The county police team stationed in Sankeshu, Huaiyin, learned that bandits were setting fire to rope yards in Tangwang and other villages nearby. They went to the rescue and killed a notorious bandit named Pan Fengtai and captured Li Jinlong. They were brought back to Sankeshu Village for interrogation and confessed that they were the main culprits in the attack on Sankeshu Village in September of this year. Just as they were about to be sent to the city, on the night of the 5th, dozens of Li's gang members went to Sankeshu Village to attack, intending to recapture Li. Fortunately, the police team discovered them and resisted with all their might, preventing them from being recaptured, and Li was shot and killed to cut off the hope of Li's gang. Yesterday, the details of the incident were reported to the brigade headquarters and forwarded to the county for record.</p>
<p>Former Public Security Chief Attempted Suicide: Zhao Zhenhua, the former chief of the Huaiyin Public Security Bureau, had been detained by the county for more than a month by order of the Civil Affairs Department due to a case and had not yet been released. Unexpectedly, Zhao suddenly swallowed multiple opium bubbles yesterday in an attempt to commit suicide and wrote several death notes to his relatives and friends. After swallowing them, he cried out loud. The guards noticed and reported to Police Brigade Commander Yu Mesheng, who urgently summoned a Western doctor to treat him and performed various procedures. Zhao began to recover and cried out again, vaguely saying that his reputation was ruined. Many people comforted him and took strict precautions.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Private Power Industry Demands Commercial Operation: The Zhejiang Provincial Private Power Industry Association, in view of the Fourth Plenary Session, the National Private Power Industry Federation petitioned to maintain the national private power industry. Chairman Jiang proposed to the meeting to guarantee its passage.

Yesterday, it ordered the coastal county governments to investigate the real situation in order to seek consolidation methods.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Yin County Government Plans to Relocate: According to news from the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Nanjing, the Ningbo Municipal Government and the Yin County Government are both located within the urban area, and the powers of the city and county are difficult to distinguish. Furthermore, the county government's establishment in the urban area makes it inconvenient to govern the four townships. It is planned to relocate the Yin County Government to a more suitable central location to achieve better county administration. The county government is currently surveying suitable locations.</p>

<h3>Letter from the Adjutant's Office of the Fifth Brigade of the Xu-Huai-Hai Guerrilla Force</h3>
<p>Sir: I recently read the "Yangzhou Correspondence" column in your newspaper of November 30, which stated "Continuing to Visit and Arrest the Deputy Brigade Commander of the Guerrilla Force." It stated that the county police team went to the Luxian Niumiao Zhangtai Hotel in the county to visit and arrest Zhang Zhang, the deputy brigade commander of the Fifth Brigade of the Xu-Huai-Hai Guerrilla Force, but failed to find him. After investigation, our deputy brigade commander is neither an impostor nor has he committed any illegal acts. Moreover, our Deputy Brigade Commander Zhang came to Shanghai yesterday to meet with Commander Yao and report on the situation of his work in defense. There are no other circumstances. I think your newspaper's rumors are untrue, and I am writing to request a correction. Sincerely, Adjutant's Office of the Fifth Brigade of the National Revolutionary Anti-Rebel Army Xu-Huai-Hai Guerrilla Force, December 7.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Province Petitions the Executive Yuan to Sell Official Land and Allocate the Proceeds to Education Funds</h3>
<p>The education cause in Zhejiang Province has developed rapidly in recent years, but it has suffered from insufficient funding. Recently, Zhejiang Province petitioned the Executive Yuan to allow the sale of official property to supplement education funds. The petition states:</p>
<p>"Regarding the matter of submitting a petition: It is reported that the Education Department has stated that the previous conference of education bureau chiefs resolved in its first, third, fourth, and third sessions that the education funds of each county and city are insufficient. To cultivate talents for a hundred years, it is appropriate to seek a good method for opening up resources. It is requested that the government allocate a large amount of funds to provide assistance. However, considering that the government is currently facing many urgent matters and the treasury is stretched, it may be difficult to transfer existing funds from one area to another. It is found that the proceeds from the auction of official land in various parts of the province are funds that have not been designated for a specific purpose. It is proposed to allocate them to education funds to promote development, etc."</p>
<p>"The Department of Finance has replied that these proceeds are national income and should be submitted to the central competent authority for approval to handle accordingly. This Department has found that the education funds of Zhejiang Province are very exhausted. May it be approved to forward the submission to the central government, considering that education is related to the foundation of the country, and to allow a certain percentage of the proceeds from the sale of official land in Zhejiang Province to be allocated annually as a national treasury subsidy, to promote development. The Department hereby prepares a document and submits it to your esteemed government for review and implementation," etc.</p>
<p>"Based on this, after examining the request, it is for the sake of properly planning the education funds for the entire province and is still a necessary measure. Regarding whether or not the requested allocation should be approved, other than as designated, this Department prepares a document and submits it to your esteemed Yuan for review and instructions to be followed. This would be for the public good," etc.</p>
<h3>Preparations for the Annual Meeting of the Vocational Guidance Organizations Association</h3>

<h3>Dongtai Recovers Temple and School Properties Through the Confiscation of Missionary Properties Association</h3>
<p>The Dongtai County education community held a meeting on December 1st to recover all temple and school properties in the county through the Confiscation of Missionary Properties Association. Many organizations participated, and Mr. Fang Xizhi was elected as chairman. Multiple resolutions were passed, and the following declaration was issued:</p>
<p>"In Xiaohai and Huanian in Dongtai, there have always been community schools, Confucius temples, and missionary properties, totaling 287 *qing* 48 *mu* 8 *fen* and 2 *li*. During the years 1919 and 1920, the former tenants, including Shang Huanjing, Defengheng, Yuan Xinji, and Dai Shunji, successively subleased more than 20,000 *mu* to the Tong-Sui Company for the purpose of collecting firewood, allocating fuel, paying rent, and running schools. However, in the autumn of 1925, Shen Jiaxun, the manager of the company, enticed a few scoundrels from Caonian to collude in signing an agreement to convert the land. This was subsequently overturned by the joint efforts of the people from both locations. Unexpectedly, in the spring of 1926, the company forcibly cultivated the land with armed forces. We immediately telegraphed the provincial government and relevant departments, appealing for the recovery of the land. However, the company, relying on the influence of the local bully Zhang Qi in Nantong, deceived and obscured the truth, resulting in no effect. When the Revolutionary Army rose up, Qian Xizao and other citizens from Caonian filed a complaint with the provincial government, accusing Zhang Qi of occupying the school property and requesting a seal. Fortunately, the provincial government issued a clear order for the company to hand over the missionary properties, and for the Education Bureau to renew the lease and collect rent to protect the school property and avoid prolonged occupation. Just as the county government and the Education Bureau were carrying out the order, the company once again engaged in extensive activities, deceiving and controlling the Jianyun Office, and in turn, consulting the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines and Central University, which resulted in an order to temporarily suspend rent collection and wait for the dispatch of a commissioner to investigate and resolve the matter fairly. Later, the commissioner investigated and replied, based on the county gazetteer, maps, grain strings, lease agreements, and various documents, which all sufficiently proved that the temple and school properties were educational properties. Furthermore, the local people fully disclosed the company's various illegal and forceful occupations over the years, as well as its cunning scheme of using litigation to intentionally delay the matter. Fortunately, the provincial government clearly discerned the truth and decided that the property rights belonged to education, and that the company would temporarily continue to cultivate the land with increased rent. The county government was ordered to convene consultations on the method of increasing rent and contracting the land. Unexpectedly, the company, in a state of being unable to justify its actions and having no way to argue, resorted to its usual trick of delaying, convening several times but refusing to attend. The various circles in the locality were determined to recover this type of property, and this approach was not thorough. However, due to the solemnity of the provincial order, the aim was to proceed gradually, and it only involved increasing the rent. The company had already been granted leniency regarding the huge illegal profits it had obtained over the years through forceful occupation. The company should have reformed and sincerely accepted this, but it shamelessly continued to engage in evil and remained stubbornly resistant. Fortunately, our provincial government saw through their deceit and promptly issued an order to enforce management and collect rent to await resolution. The county commissioner has been executing the rent collection for several days now, but has only collected a small amount of rent. In its desperation, the company has come up with an outlandish method, pre-emptively assigning most of the cultivated land under the names of private shareholders such as Zhu Jingci and Yu Jingzhi, and only handing over a small number of rental records. At the same time, it has deceptively submitted reports to the provincial government, using personal ownership and company ownership to confuse the provincial authorities' vision, hoping that the enforcement of the custody of rent would be evaded. Little does it know that the company has no ownership of the temple and school missionary properties, and its sale to others is not valid. Moreover, the act of dividing it among shareholders is actually a false transfer to others, regardless of whether it is real or not, is illegal. Furthermore, both personal ownership and company ownership are illegal occupations. Custody applies to the company, but not to individuals, which is not reasonable in law or principle. It is like pursuing stolen goods and the possessions of the ringleader; how can the possessions divided among the accomplices be ignored? It is also heard that Zhu and Yu are engaged in activities everywhere, hoping to fundamentally undermine the educational property rights of Dongtai. The people from all walks of life, at this critical juncture, are particularly indignant at Zhu and Yu's willingness to be accomplices and be used by the company to undermine the effects of the years of struggle by the people of Dongtai. Therefore, on November 20th, our association convened a meeting of various sectors at the district party consolidation meeting, resolving to send representatives to the provincial government to petition for the unconditional recovery of the temple and school missionary properties, and for the Education Bureau to separately convene tenants to contract the land, ordering the company to hand over all the rents it has embezzled over the years, returning them to the public, and permanently preventing disputes, so as to benefit education. Furthermore, the company's manager, Zhang Shudian, the head of the development department, Wang Weizhou, and Zhu Yu and others who have been manipulating the educational property should be detained to deter conspiracies. At the same time, a date will be set to hold a county-wide propaganda meeting to recover the temple and school missionary properties to demonstrate our determination. For this reason, a brief overview of the process is hereby announced to the people from all walks of life in the province, hoping for their unanimous support, so that the goal of recovering the educational property rights of more than 20,000 *mu* of temple and school properties can be achieved as soon as possible. In the future, if the educational cause of Dongtai is fortunate enough to develop, then the 1.14 million people of Dongtai will all benefit greatly. As for those who collude with the company, disregarding public reason and privately transferring ownership, or attempting to use any deceptive tactics to undermine the educational property rights of Dongtai's recovery of temple and school properties, they are all public enemies of the 1.14 million people of Dongtai and will not be recognized. This is our declaration."</p>

It was decided that the association had supreme authority over the table tennis community, and that those who enthusiastically donated prizes should preferably hand them over to the association to organize the events. Otherwise, they must be reviewed and approved by the association. (a) The organizers of table tennis championships outside the association must have the ability to be financially independent and whether they violate amateur sports and have a profit-seeking purpose. (b) The organizers must have a suitable stadium and be subject to the supervision of the association before they can organize events. (3) Measures to prohibit teams from joining championships not approved by the association. It was decided that any table tennis team or table tennis player who violates the association's orders and joins a championship that has not been approved by the association will have their membership and all rights of the association revoked from now on, such as attending international competitions and individual championships. (4) All current staff members of the association should urgently provide written guarantees to the association from the responsible teams they represent within one week, stating that if any staff member engages in illegal activities, damages the reputation of the association, or commits financial fraud during their term of office, they will be fully liable for compensation. (5) Send letters to each team explaining that they must not join illegal championships that have not been approved by the association. (6) What kind of competition rules should be adopted? It was decided that before the new rules are promulgated, the old rules translated by Mr. Wu Maoqing will be used. (7) Adjournment.</p>
<h3>Liusan Garden Hosts a Banquet for the Chinese Team in the International Walking Race</h3>
<p>This Month's 14th</p>
<p>The International Walking Race was held on the 7th, and the Chinese team won the championship again, winning the championship for three consecutive years, which is truly admirable. The victory this time not only delighted the Chinese people, but also earned praise from foreigners. The Japanese owner of Liusan Garden in this city specially invited the members of the walking race team to a banquet at the garden this Sunday (14th) in order to slightly celebrate. All those who participated in the competition and the individual competitions, as well as the introducing members, will gather at Moore Hall and depart at the same time. It is heard that the Progressive Association and Zhong Baiyan will also choose a day to host a banquet.</p>
<h3>Labor Women's Basketball Team Defeats China</h3>
<p>23 to 3</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Physical Education School basketball team led a team to Jiangwan yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. for a friendly match with Labor University. The referee was Zhao Zong'e. Labor University had strong strength. Miss Cheng, a forward, was particularly skilled at throwing the ball and scored a total of 20 points. Her inner guards also had tight defense. China was also a skilled team, but unfortunately, due to unfamiliarity with the court and unfamiliar throwing skills, they were flustered. Therefore, apart from struggling hard in the first quarter, with no clear winner, they were at a loss. However, their fighting spirit was unwavering. As a result, Labor won by 23 to 3. After the match, Labor provided refreshments, and everyone dispersed happily.</p>
<h3>The Holding University Basketball Team Will Go to Beijing Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Son—Father, what is a diplomat? Father—A diplomat is a dignified expert in lying. The more they lie to foreigners, the greater their contribution to their own country.</p>
<p>Son—Mother, I think black hens are smarter than white hens.</p>
<p>Mother—How do you know?</p>
<p>Son—Just look at our black hen and white hen. The black hen lays a white egg, but the white hen can't lay a black egg. That's why I say the black hen is smarter.</p>
<p>A—This pistol of mine is from the time of Confucius.</p>

<p>A—What exactly happened? The weather is mild and sunny today. Where did the lightning come from?</p>

<h3>A Record of the Opening of the China International Radio Station</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications' China International Radio Station held its opening ceremony on the sixth of this month, a grand occasion unprecedented in our country. Leaders from all walks of life were invited in advance to visit. I will record what I saw and heard on that day.</p>
<p>On that day, the Ministry of Communications sent staff to the North Station to receive guests. After the guests signed in, they were given a magnetic badge to wear, which served as a train ticket. The Ministry had chartered six first, second, and third-class carriages specifically to transport guests to Zhenru. The train departed at one o'clock and arrived in Zhenru in fifteen minutes. Because the radio station was several miles from the station, ten cars had been pre-arranged, each with a small flag on top, to take guests to the station. Each car was limited to six passengers. Because there were few cars and many people, it took more than ten trips to transport everyone. The radio station base covers 191 acres, 4 fen, 1 li, and 9 hao. It is approximately fifteen Chinese miles from Zhabei. A bridge, Xujia Bridge, was specially built on the bank of the Taopu River. On that day, a memorial arch of pine and cypress was erected high on the bridge, with the four large characters "Opening Ceremony" hanging on it. After passing through the arch, one arrived at the radio station gatehouse. The national flags of the Party and the country were crossed at the main entrance. Three iron towers stood tall into the clouds, with flags and colorful decorations also hanging on top. The antenna network was densely spread across the sky. The transmitting room was filled with machines. The power room had glass on three sides, with a valve chamber below. Fire had already been ignited, and the sound of it was continuous. On the open ground was a reservoir, with a road built around it. Before the meeting began, armed patrolmen rode motorcycles around the pool in circles. It was like a carousel purchased by children during the New Year. The audience was packed. The auditorium was a large reed mat shed temporarily erected beside the road, ten rooms wide and fourteen rooms long. The exterior was covered with national flags. Inside, there were hundreds of seats. A portrait of the Premier was hung on the stage, along with a paper scroll that read, "The revolution has not yet succeeded. Comrades must continue to work hard." A table was placed in the center, covered with a white tablecloth. A radio was placed on top. A semi-circle of a dozen chairs was set up behind the table. Wang Zhengting and his wife arrived in the same car. Because the floor of the auditorium was dirt, it was covered with reed mats. But it was uneven. Mrs. Wang did not walk on bound feet, so she was inconvenienced. A greeter was at her side for support. The front two rows of seats were for foreign guests. Both men and women were present. The French consul and others, along with representatives from the central government and Minister Wang, were all on the stage. At the opening ceremony, the will was read first. The foreign guests all followed the crowd in paying respects, bowing their heads in silence. Minister Wang Boqun of the Ministry of Communications presided over the meeting. When reporting the purpose of the meeting, he stood to the right of the table. Because the radio reception was poor, the master of ceremonies asked him to move to the center of the stage. The speech had been printed in advance. It emphasized four points: (1) to meet the needs of the country and the people; (2) to safeguard the right to international communications; (3) to promote international relations; and (4) to increase the effectiveness of international propaganda. It was more than a thousand words. Wu Dao-yi, a representative of the central government, gave a speech in which he compared the radio station to the throat of a person. Zhang Qun, a representative of the national government, gave a speech detailing the history of China's electrical communications industry, from the eighth year of Guangxu to the present day. Experts in the electrical communications industry all sighed in admiration. Wang Zhengting gave a speech in which he said that with this radio station, future international communications would not need to be handled by foreigners, and that by exchanging information with other countries, misunderstandings could be avoided, which would have a significant impact on diplomacy. On the spot, he congratulated Wang Boqun. The audience applauded. There was a clever remark about Minister Wang congratulating Minister Wang. Following Wang's speech, Ye Huijun took off his coat, revealing a pistol. Everyone paid attention. He said that he was attending today in the capacity of a host. It has been nineteen years since the founding of the Republic of China. It is called democracy, but there has been much suffering. I am also one of the hosts. Today, seeing this radio station, I firmly believe that the Ministry of Communications is doing a good job. Being near-sighted and hard of hearing is like having inconvenient human transportation. The radio station is to the country as ears and eyes are to the human body. His words were humorous and comical. Before leaving, he said coarse and chaotic things like "the good show is yet to come." Everyone laughed. Then, French Consul Gangelin gave a speech in French, which was translated. After the French consul's speech, Nengsi, the Far East manager of the American Radio Corporation, and Li Bai, the general representative of the American Radio Corporation, spoke. Due to time constraints, the chairman announced that there would be no further translations. The agenda included reading congratulatory telegrams. However, to save time, it was changed to reporting the names of the senders. After the meeting, everyone went to the pool to take a group photo. After the tour, refreshments were served. Everyone then took cars to the station. The train departed at five o'clock. It was already night when we arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Setting Things Down with The Tune "Qitianle" In Autumn With Ancient Menthus Sea Tibet Master Shu Yong Chun Nong Gong Zhu Ba Kebo Kui Ji Jiancheng And Guai Yuan</h3>
<p>— Yu Shan, Pan Laolan</p>
<p>I have broken my promise to ascend high on the Double Ninth Festival. The garden is late in the autumn. The clustered chrysanthemums scatter fragrance. The lotus remains with pink. All enter the paintings of lyricists. I have arrived at the thatched gate. I am too lazy to talk of wine, and remote from playing the Qin. There are few elegant outings. I inscribe verses with drunken ink. Today is not like the old days. Where are the people who appreciate my music? I am accustomed to drifting around the world. Who understands my secret aspirations? The tide society’s books sink. The south village’s dreams are distant. When will I return with my oars? Pour the fragrant wine to persuade. I am separated by water and drifting lights. I wear my hat tilted when I meet flowers. We discussed our hearts one night. My temples are heavy with black silk.</p>
<h3>Fudan University Student Marries a Female School Employee’s Daughter</h3>
<p>— Li Qing</p>
<p>Wu Shumo, a third-year student in the Department of Political Science at Fudan University, is from Sichuan. A year ago, he boarded with a farmer at No. 10 Songgang Lane, behind the school. Xu Fubao, a tea boy in the fourth dormitory of the school, also lived there with his wife and daughter to facilitate his service. Xu's daughter is seventeen years old. She is beautiful. Although her skin is slightly dark, it is extremely delicate. She has a gentle and virtuous temperament and knows a little about books and letters. Wu is over twenty years old. He studies hard far from home, and feels quite lonely in his lodgings. Having such a beautiful neighbor naturally leads to the "good Qiu" intention. After associating for a long time, they fell in love. The girl's parents were thrilled to have such an amazing encounter, so they readily agreed to the engagement. The school was abuzz with the news for a time. The bulletin boards were filled with news of this engaged couple every day. Shanghai tabloids have also reported on it, but unfortunately, the details are unknown.</p>
<p>After the engagement, Wu immediately began to live with his future in-laws. His mother-in-law took care of all the laundry. Wu's daughter-in-law showed him more care and warmth than a married woman. His classmates all praised and envied him.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Wu sent out wedding invitations, scheduled to hold the wedding ceremony at the Great China Hotel on the seventh of this month. The officiant was Mr. Gao Yihan. The introducer was a nephew of Xu Shiying. The bridesmaids were two of the school's "Four Heavenly Kings," the Cheng Yan and Cheng Jia sisters. The groomsmen were Wu's classmates Chen Dongming and Chen Weiguan. The talented individuals were a sensation at the time. It is said that the two Heavenly Kings each gave the bride two pieces of cheongsam material.</p>
<p>The wedding ceremony was entirely traditional. The ceremony abandoned the three bows and used the three kneelings and nine kowtows. Wu's parents-in-law also dressed like noble people, receiving the important ceremony from this excellent son-in-law. All the wedding attendees were university students, gathered together in great joy.</p>
<p>Chinese marriages have always adhered to the old "law of matching doors and households." Mr. Wu's ability to abolish this bad example and break down class concepts is indeed a model for modern young men and women who are obsessed with class consciousness. I am writing this down to share with the readers of Free Talk.</p>
<h3>Discussing Plum Blossoms with Clear Songs and Beautiful Dances</h3>
<p>— Smiling Student</p>
<p>The Plum Blossom Girls' Song and Dance Troupe returned to Shanghai on the sixth of this month after performing in Chongqing, Yichang, Changsha, Hankou, and Nanjing for nine months. Due to rumors of their endangerment encountered in Shanghai newspapers when performing in Chongqing, they put on a large-scale public performance, both to refute past rumors and to present recent new works. Thus, the girls' clear songs and youthful dances appeared at the Odeon Grand Theater on the eighth and thirteenth.</p>
<p>I went to see the first performance on the eighth. Because I arrived late, there were no good seats in the theater. I watched eight acts from the corner of the room: "Double Flying Together," "He Went to the Dance Hall," "Sailor Dance," "Riot in the Ink Bottle," "Ten Li Long Pavilion, Ten Cups of Wine," "Butterfly Shadows," "Playing with the Dragon and Phoenix," and "Seven Emotions." Among them, Gong Qiuxia and Zhang Qi's "Double Flying Together" had synchronized steps and identical gestures, which was very beautiful to see. The two ladies' acrobatics must have taken more than a day's work to achieve. Qiuxia also had an act called "Riot in the Ink Bottle," which was humorous and comical, demonstrating her talent in both singing and dancing. Zhang Xianlin's clear songs "He Went to the Dance Hall" and "Ten Li Long Pavilion, Ten Cups of Wine" had the same voice and expressions as Li Minghui. Now that Li has retired, Xianlin should be able to stand alone. Ms. Cai Yiming, I heard, is the younger sister of musician Cai Wenjin. She is full of masculine beauty. Having been influenced by her brother, her work is naturally not weak. The sailor dance is the most difficult to please. Yiming's dance hits all the right spots. The applause followed. What you expect to see. Zhang Qi and Huang Hun's "Playing with the Dragon and Phoenix" is a complete performance of the art of human beautification. It is particularly energetic. The grand song and dance drama "Seven Emotions," I heard, is a collaboration between Wei Yunmei, Cai Wenjin, and Wei Rongbo. The entire troupe performed it. The plot is an anti-Journey to the West story. Tang Sanzang passes through the Spider Cave, is seduced by the seven emotions, and ends up marrying into the family. It is truly an odd thing. Gong Qiuxia, Zhang Qi, Zhang Xianlin, Cai Yiming, Xu Canying, Qian Zhongxiu, and Weng Lanhun played the seven emotions. Yang Pan, Huang Hun, and Sun Dejia played Tang Sanzang, Sun Wukong, and Zhu Wuneng, each doing their best. Such a song and dance is rarely seen. The dance of Zhu Bajie in particular caused a lot of laughter.</p>
<h3>Travels in Nanyang (97)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>The people here, both men and women, generally apply powder to their faces. The powder is coarse and yellow, perhaps medicinal. It is not only for beauty. Indian men and women often apply a red line or dot between their eyebrows, perhaps as a belief or religion. Women like to smoke, and some middle-aged people use large opium pipes, which is surprising. They cut a large bamboo pole three or four feet long, drill a small hole, place the tobacco on top, and smoke it. I saw this in Guangxi in the past, and now I see it again overseas.</p>
<p>In Saigon and other places, the buffalo horns were very good. The white buffalo horns in Singapore and Penang are also impressive. I thought that the white buffalo horns near India would be even better, but in Yangon, I only saw blunt-horned white buffaloes. The horns in Penang are the best, in various styles. In the future, those who want to see white buffalo horns should go to Penang to see them and not miss the opportunity.</p>
<p>On the eleventh, Master Wanhui visited Jinmen with me. We visited a Tang Dynasty temple where nuns lived. It was very clean. The vegetarian noodles were quite good. There were seven or eight nuns living there, recommended by people from Guangdong. There are many nuns here. Men are called Zhaigong (vegetarian gentlemen), and women are called Zhaipo (vegetarian women). Guanxiu had traveled to Japan for ten years. He has a temple in Kuala Lumpur and a temple on Guanyin Mountain in Hong Kong. His influence is quite large. Master Wanhui is working on the Huiye Abode, so he is soliciting donations for it. We passed a Catholic church set up by Westerners for the Chinese. The clerk, Tianjin Wen, had several books in French. That day, we also visited the White Pagoda, which is a large pagoda facing the Great Golden Pagoda. It is second only to the Great Golden Pagoda and also has four gates. The statues are made of beautiful marble, which makes people envious. In general, the beauty of Buddhist statues is mostly due to the beauty of women. Deng Xuegeng said that they are not as elaborate as Western carvings. The East excels in tranquility and charm. There is a Burmese library and fortune tellers in the pagoda.</p>
<p>In front of the pagoda, we met a pedicurist. Zhong Yugong said that he could do pedicures for only two copper coins. He had it done, but it was very rough, only cutting the toenails. It was not like the Chinese pedicures. Clipping fingernails costs four coins. Zhong said that this was another kind of Indian. Their family eats vegetarian food for generations and is very foolish. They don't know how to count, so they will always only work as pedicurists. India is a large country with many different kinds of people, and the customs are very strange. This is one such example.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (334)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 16: Cui Xiu Earnestly Asks for Words from the Teacher, a Banquet of Heroines Discusses Military Affairs in a Brothel</p>
<p>So at that time, Chinese-style wooden furniture was still used. The most affordable and beautiful material was rosewood. It would last for decades without changing its appearance. Adding elaborate carvings was also a form of art in our country. Now, in Luyi's pavilion, there was also a rosewood carved bed. The rest of the furniture was also rosewood. When Zuo Shichen went to the small garden that day, he saw Luyi wearing a cherry blossom white Liyun satin gray squirrel fur coat that her mother had just made for her. Her pants were the same color. The buttons were large red camellias the size of teacups. She usually wore a braid, but today she had her hair in a bun. She wore a red flower from a cactus on the top of her head. Her shoes were a pale white, and the toes were embroidered with a pair of red goldfish. Chinese colors use red to represent good luck. Today was the opening of Luyi's new room, like the grand opening of a store. Everywhere, she wanted to show good luck. That's why there were red colors everywhere. On the buttons, on the bun, on the toes of the shoes. The bright colors were dazzling. And she usually only wore a thin layer of powder. Today, she applied extra white powder and extra red rouge. Her eyebrows were painted a small green, and her lips were dotted with cherry red. She looked particularly stylish and elegant. When Zuo Shichen saw her, he said, "You're even more beautiful today." Luyi smiled and said, "Do I look like a little old woman with this hairstyle?" Zuo Shichen said, "You don't look like a little old woman. You look like a bride." Luyi gave him a slight angry glare. Then, a middle-aged woman walked out of the room. She looked like she was only in her thirties. She was holding a water pipe in her hand and said with a smile, "Is this the second young master Zuo?" Then, Luyi introduced her, "This is my mother." When Zuo Shichen looked at her mother, he saw that although she was only in her thirties, there was a layer of powder on her face, but under the powder, there was a faint hint of blue. She probably smoked opium. Sending her daughter into prostitution was at least closely related to her smoking opium. After a person becomes addicted to opium, they take other things lightly. But they have to smoke opium. As long as there is a light, everything returns to peace, like an old monk in meditation. To the point where today they can skip white rice, but they must prepare black rice early. Because opium is a personal problem. Other things are so-so. He also thought of the powder on her face, which was also mostly related to opium. Because she wanted to cover up the smoky look on her face, she had to add a layer of color. Unfortunately, opium is truly as the ancients said, "revealed in the face, overflowing on the back, applied to the four limbs." No matter how much you try to cover it up, you can't. Zuo Shichen thought to himself, having a mother like this is a way to corrupt Luyi.</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Market Calms Down</h3>
<p>Vacillating Towards a Soft Trend - Yesterday, December 11th, the soaring gold price finally subsided and tended to weaken, but the state was confusing and the situation was in a hovering state. There were twists and turns of three or four taels at times. The industry's will was frustrated. Throughout the day, there were nine taels of change. Looking back at the market transactions, although they were prosperous, the receipts and payments were different. Yuancheng and Xinheng bought in, while Yuancheng, Yongyuanheng, Bingxing, etc. came out and then went in again. Dalian Gang's demand exceeded supply. The overseas silver market had a divergent trend. Large bars were slightly lower, and silver prices rose sharply. The gold market opened low. Later, as the foreign exchange market also showed signs of easing, the 630 tael mark was suddenly broken. Afterwards, the storm surged, taking weakness as its vanguard, and heavily rushed out of 35 taels. The reason for this was that Yuanheng, Bingxing, Yuancheng, Yongyuan, etc. re-purchased. Especially as the exchange rate improved, unexpectedly by noon, a low depreciation occurred. The market's floating included a fluctuation of 4 taels. The post-market is still disorderly, hovering around 30 taels, and eventually weakened, but it supported around 631 taels, indicating that the exchange rate has seen a loosening. It is said that large bars are expected to rebound this morning.</p>
<p>The Morning State is Vague - Since the opening of the January market this morning, it was 632 taels, a drop of 2 taels and 5 qian (the rough price ranged from around 30 taels to over 32 taels, with diversified transactions). Large bars were only lower by one-sixteenth, while silver prices rose by one-half, and private telegraphs also increased by one-half. With the Citi having a sustaining position, people's hearts became vacant. Immediately afterwards, Yuancheng, Yongyuanheng, Bingxing, etc. tended to sell, and the price fell from 32 taels 4-5 qian to within 30 taels. The exchange rate was also clumsy. Korea bought the Dalian 1 tael at 3 qian 7 fen 6 li 2 hao 5. The January English gold could be settled at 1.59375, so the leading order when it opened was continued to be reduced to 28 taels 6 qian 7 hao 5, with the listed price not changing. It was then increased to 9 taels 3-4 qian, but Zhifeng, Yongxieyu, etc. sold quite a bit, due to the January English gold being able to be settled at 1.6, and the March Zhongfu Sumitomo co-op being at 1.60625, so at 9:45, it suddenly went to 28 taels. Afterwards, it gradually showed an upward trend. Because Wanxing, Shunli, Yuancheng, Yuanheng, Bingxing, etc. re-chased in, the situation became turbulent for a time, with a tendency to rise step by step, again exceeding the 30 tael mark. Mitsui absorbed the Dalian 1 tael at 3 qian 7 fen 5. Korea put out the March English gold at only 1.58125. Gold firms rushed to buy in, causing the gold price to soar by 5-6 taels, until 11:15, it was 36 taels 8 qian. After entering, it suddenly saw a setback. Then, Tongtai, Chang, Yongfeng, Hongxing, Yong, etc. rose up to sell, and English gold also weakened accordingly. The January 1.58125 could be settled. The gold price fell sharply, plummeting by 4 taels and 0, only 32 taels 5 qian. By the close, it was 3 taels, and then another tael was added, because the goods came in, so the goods were raised by 5 qian. The listed price was still 677 taels 2 qian. The deposit was counted from 48-49 taels to 40 taels 0. It was 43-44 taels at noon.</p>
<p>There are Many Changes in the Aftermarket - The aftermarket opened at 34 taels. Afterwards, due to the seller's activity and the addition of 5 anna to the Indian exchange, it broke the 30 tael mark. Retailers bought in, suddenly adding more than 2 taels. At 2:40, it was 32 taels 2-3 qian. Suddenly, Chenfeng, Yongtai, Kangrun, Xuchang, etc. all came out, and it suddenly fell to 28 taels. The March English gold Mitsui and Zhengjin co-op at 1.6. After 3 o'clock, Zhifeng, Yongyuanmao, Yongyuanheng, etc. bought in. Also, Dongya absorbed the January 1.59375, and Mitsui absorbed the Dalian 1 tael at 3 qian 6 fen 5, so the gold price improved again by more than 4 taels. However, at times it rose and fell by one or two taels. At 4 o'clock, it was 33 taels 7 qian. Afterwards, the market situation was confusing. The transactions of each firm in the field were also chaotic and the price was one or two taels higher or lower. By 4:30, when the market closed, it was 631 taels, a drop of 3 taels and a half compared to the previous day. It was then reduced by a small tael, counting 30 taels. Goods, etc. were sold. It was found that the maximum price during the day was 36 taels 8 qian, and the minimum price was 28 taels, a difference of 8 taels 8 qian. The goods were 32 taels 1 qian in the early market, 3 taels and a half at noon, 4 taels and 1 qian in the afternoon, and 30 taels at the close. The quoted price was from 43-44 taels to 47-48 taels. The result was 46-47 taels. The registered price was from 36 taels to 33 taels. The supplemental water was 36 taels in the morning and 34 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Trading is Extremely Chaotic - Among the peers' transactions, Yuancheng, Shunli, Wanxing, and Yuanmaoyong all bought in, while Tongtai, Chang, Zhifengyong, and Dadecheng had inconsistent inflows and outflows. Yongfeng, Taikangrun, Yudayong, Fuxingyong, Yuanxingyong, and Xieyu all sold out. Yuanheng, Bingxing, and Yuancheng Yong sold out and then bought in again. In the afternoon, Chenfeng Yong, Yuanheng, Taikangrun, Yudayong, Xieyu, Wanxing, and Yuanxingyong all sold out. Shunli and Yuanmaoyong had inconsistent inflows and outflows. Zhifengyong, Xinheng, and Yuancheng Yong all bought in. There were many receipts and payments of goods. Dalian Gang had a total of more than 4,000 bars coming in and several thousand bars being sold out.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Exchange Has Turned Slack</h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants Throw Out and Settle From Time to Time… Large Bars May Rebound</p>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market had a divergent trend. English silver was low and American silver rose. With Citi initially selling and then maintaining the silver price, the market trended stable. English-American exchange rates have risen. The Kobe market set fixed exchange rates. All HSBC licenses, except for Hong Kong's reduction of 25 to 80 taels and 5 qian, had no changes. However, banks lengthened forward market quotes by half a notch for buying in. The domestic English, American, and Japanese exchange rates have become reversed, as a relaxation after repeated tightening. The gold market's soaring wind has calmed, but the waves are still turbulent, rising and falling unpredictably, with a difference of nine taels throughout the day. The 630 tael mark was once broken. Then, all exchange rates diverged. As a result, compared to the previous noon, English gold was up 25, American gold was up half a yuan, and Japanese gold was down by a huge two fen. Chinese gold merchants had different inflows and outflows. When the gold price rose, they all bought in. When it fell, they sold out. The general idea was to hedge. A total of 200,000 pounds of English gold was transacted. Banks such as Hefeng, Huabi, Korea, and Dongya all received deposits. Sumitomo, Korea, Dongya, Huabi, etc. also sold out. Also, Chinese and Japanese banks exchanged more than 100,000 pounds. British American Tobacco absorbed a little. American gold exchanged over 200,000 yuan between the banks. There were few Japanese gold transactions. Only the Dalian tickets were thrown out by Dalian Gang for more than 1 million yuan. Mitsui, Sumitomo, and Korea took them in. The hedge with the spot gold market was about 18 taels away in English gold, 24-5 taels in American gold, and 20-odd taels in Japanese gold. However, the general import merchants, both Chinese and foreign, suffered a heavy blow. They had to settle the maturing goods, and the amount of loss was unspeakable. Yesterday, the market seemed to turn weak. Today, large bars may rebound.</p>

<h3>Little Change in Subsidiary Coinage and Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market prices for various silver dollar subsidiary coins saw little change, due to scarce transactions and a lack of enthusiasm. Moreover, the morning and afternoon market prices were identical, as if the afternoon market was not open, which suggests that the market has reached its limit. All collections and payments are being finalized, making the situation even more quiet. It is anticipated that there will be no significant news afterward.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market: Few Sellers After the Fall</h3>
<p>The yarn market felt slightly calmer, as there was a lack of new sellers after the big drop. However, the overall global situation remains weak, with American cotton grades declining across the board. As a result, Japanese merchants have a strong desire to sell, and the Chaozhou gang continues to sell and increase their positions. The various gangs currently selling on the market lack long-term purchasing power, and the future remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Human Biao Quiet: The opening of the Renbiao market was sluggish due to the decline in American cotton. Each contract fell by six to seven qian. There was a slight increase in some short covering in the second and third rounds, resulting in a rise or fall of one to two qian for each month. In the afternoon, it was reported that actual sales were sluggish, and the three grades of yarn fell back down. Japanese merchants sold off, and the market softened slightly. At closing, prices fell again. Total transactions for the day were 103,100 bales. It was found that the sales were: Gongtai 900 bales, Ruidia 900 bales, Dafeng 600 bales, Hanfeng 600 bales, and the remainder 3, 5, 600 bales. The purchases were: Changfeng 1,000 bales, Yukang 850 bales, and the remainder 2, 3, 400 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Renbiao Closing Prices | Rise/Fall | Balance |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| March 143.4 | ·· | 25,250 |</p>
<p>| December 139.0 | Down 1.20 | 60,600 |</p>
<p>| April 144.5 | Up 1.2 | 22,350 |</p>

<p>| May 145.62 | 10,210 |</p>
<p>| February 141.7 | 132,250 |</p>
<p>Actual Sales are Lighter: Actual yarn sales were lighter than before. It was found that total purchases by various gangs throughout the day were 800 bales, futures 100 bales, and inter-trade purchases 105 bales. Prices fell by 2.5 to 5 qian. Among customer gangs, Shantou purchased 215 bales, the interior purchased 200 bales, Hankou purchased 265 bales, Changsha purchased 40 bales, Qingdao purchased 25 bales, Tianjin purchased 55 bales, and miscellaneous gangs purchased 100 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market in a Stable State</h3>
<p>The cotton market is stable, and sentiment is also stable. Bulls are strongly pulling up the market, and the supply from Hankou is not smooth. Also, due to exchange rate relationships, the market remains firm. However, the desire to sell is increasing among some. Currently, the bulls and bears are fiercely contesting. At present, the factories are quiet, with no action. In the future, there may be dramatic changes.</p>
<p>Hankou Biao Still Stable: The opening of the Hankou Biao market was slightly bearish due to the deteriorating situation in American cotton. Each contract fell by five fen to one qian. In the afternoon, the Ningbo gang purchased, and prices rose slightly by five fen. Total transactions for the day were 31,600 dan. It was found that the sales were: Ruidia 3,400 dan, Tianlong 2,400 dan, Dafeng 2,800 dan, Dafu 2,100 dan, Maoji 2,200 dan, and the remainder 1,8-900 dan. The purchases were: Yuchang 5,900 dan, Shenchang 2,100 dan, Hengyi 1,800 dan, and the remainder 8-900 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Weakness in Foreign Yarn and Cotton Continues</h3>
<p>American Cotton Firms and Then Weakens: Yesterday, American cotton initially strengthened due to positive Liverpool news, but then weakened due to weakness on Wall Street and mass selling. Futures fell by 11 to 17 points, and spot prices fell by 15 points. British cotton futures rose by 3 points, and spot prices rose by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 15 points. The Indian cotton market was firm, with Pingguoer near and far terms rising by 3 rupees, Aomura rising by 3 rupees, far terms rising by 2 rupees, and Bairoxi rising by 2 rupees. The original cables are recorded below (December 10th cable):</p>

<h3>Grain Market: River Downstream Rice Market Softens</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, 30-40 boats arrived from the Luli area. Sales in this street were uneven. The off-take of Northern Japonica rice remained sluggish, with vendors competing for high-quality goods and market sentiment remained stable. There was little interest in the ordinary middle grades due to a fall of two angles, and the current price of second-grade high-quality Japonica rice is just at the 13 yuan mark. The overall situation depends entirely on sales. Thin rice continued to soften by one to two angles, and buying interest was extremely quiet. With the continuous arrival of supply, further price declines would not be surprising. Sales of Yangxian rice were very active, and the cost of transfer to Shanghai was also high, so prices were firm. Du Xian seemed to have customer interest, but top-quality goods were scarce, and the market appeared relatively stable. Ordinary high grades opened at around 12.5 yuan. Ship-tip arrivals were rare and sales were good. There was initially a slight increase, but then buyers became tight and stood still. Top-quality Bianyuan rice remained scarce, and market transactions were all in ordinary goods. The market was stable at high prices, with secondary grades falling by half an angle. The hidden market was slightly weak and mediocre.</p>
<p>Hunan, Shanghai: Yesterday, 20-30 boats arrived from various gangs. Market sales were slow. Changshu and Wuxi Northern Japonica rice from downstream rivers still lacked top-quality goods, so transactions in ordinary and high grades were not bad, but market sentiment showed fatigue, falling by half an angle to two angles. Sales of various kinds of Jiangsu rice were still okay, but there was still a large inventory, and there was no large outlet for sales. Prices fell due to downward pressure, with rice from Tongli priced at around 11.5 yuan. Thin rice from the southern routes remained sluggish, with slow sales and few transactions. The overall market fell by another small angle. Sales of Yang and Du grades felt weak, and although arrivals were not many, the market was stable and tired. Bianyuan rice and the hidden market had slow and wooden sales, and market prices all fell by about an angle.</p>
<h3>Flour Market: Morning Decline, Afternoon Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, prices for each month were impacted by the falling Canadian wheat prices in foreign markets by three to four angles, while Chicago wheat showed little change. Also, because the gold market slightly retreated from its peak, sentiment was soft. However, most manufacturers believed that the situation was already good, and they largely maintained their positions. There were very few speculators selling, and external short sellers were also only making sporadic moves due to fear of being squeezed. Therefore, the price differences for each month were only about two fen compared to the previous day. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, it was still weak, but then large short sellers aggressively covered their positions, and the market rebounded again. Given this situation, the outlook may still turn better. As a result, the current month fell slightly by 0.25 fen compared to the previous day, January fell by 0.1 fen, February fell by 0.5 li, and March, April, and May fell by 0.5 li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Rebound Due to Short Covering</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a pattern of initially being stable and then becoming firm. At the initial opening in the morning, prices were slightly lower due to slightly falling wheat prices in foreign markets and the gold market slightly retreating, so the opening price was 4 taels 2 qian 8 fen. Prices for each month of the forward contracts also fell by 3-4 fen compared to the previous day. However, after the second round, prices rebounded due to significant short covering. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the situation became tight again. It was still difficult to determine whether the wheat that the short positions had fixed could arrive on schedule for the current month, so the buying position was inevitably better. Large buyers entered the forward contracts, with purchases of over 100 cars. Therefore, the market rose again. As a result, the closing price for the current month was better by 0.1 fen compared to the previous day, January and February fell by 0.1 fen, March remained unchanged, April rose by 0.1 fen, and May rose by 0.2 fen. The spot wheat market has been quiet for a long time. Yesterday, 600 bags of Xianghe wheat of medium grade were transacted at a price of 3 taels 6 qian, which were handled by Xinda.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Prices Rise and Then Retreat</h3>
<p>Icing and Fine Green Sugar Continue to Rebound</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market report from the production area indicated that the price of Cuban spot sugar remained at 1.375. The price of New York sugar futures for December was 1.30, for March next year 1.43, for May 1.51, each up by three cents. For September, the price was 1.64, up by two cents. There were no increases or decreases in Javanese futures and spot sugar prices. Outside of the association's pricing, the market sentiment settled as foreign exchange rates eased, and the buying interest was limited. Although there were a few transactions for Dutch sugar #24 coarse-grained white sugar, the price was 8 taels 2 qian 5 fen, and the market was particularly weak. Fine-grained white sugar was 8 taels 3 qian 2 fen 5 li, and transactions were also scarce. There were few inquiries for Japanese sugar N mark at 8 taels 6 qian. YT mark was 8 taels 4 qian, YRO mark was 7 taels 9 qian, and YP mark was 8 taels 9 qian 2 fen 5 li. Transactions were not numerous, and the market appeared level. The Taikoo car sugar shipments for this month, opened yesterday with 4,000 bags of HX mark at 6 taels 2 qian 5 fen, DY mark and CX mark equally divided, and the price was raised slightly. Furthermore, HX mark sugar arriving on January 15th was offered at 6 taels 4 qian and B mark at 6 taels 7 qian, both with new regulations and increased taxes. There were few takers, and only over 2,000 bags were sold in total, with sales still in progress. The number board had Huaxin Hao offering 2,000 bags of Cuban foreign sugar at a price of 6 taels 8 qian. Desheng Hao sold 500 bags of icing and fine green sugar at a price of 7 taels 6 qian, and the market was both outstanding.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Oil Sales Gradually Entering a Stalled State</h3>
<p>Hongtong Oil Rises or Falls: The sales market has already entered a stalled state. There is a thick accumulation in this city, and the market sentiment is tired. There is quite a discrepancy in reports from within the industry. The old brand Ji Yingfeng must sell for 25 taels 2 qian, Qing Yang sells for 20 taels 1 guan, and miscellaneous brands range from 17 taels to 18 taels. The overall trend is whether to raise or lower prices.</p>
<p>Hanbai Oil: Arrivals and Sales Both Quiet: The market appearance is firm. A small amount of Songhe winter oil has arrived in Hankou, and the opening price is still high at 18 taels 8 qian. Foreign sales of Macheng oil are quiet, and the rising wind has subsided. Industry sales are 17 taels 7 qian. The industry market price for Macheng oil in this city is 21 taels, with other grades increasing accordingly.</p>
<p>White Tung Oil Shows Signs of Withering Again: As the end of the year approaches, all foreign firms are preparing to close, and their handling is increasingly lax. The outlook is pessimistic, and the outer market has repeatedly lowered sales to 17 taels 2 qian. The inner market and customer market have temporarily lacked changes.</p>
<h3>Big Increase in Textile Sales</h3>
<p>All Prices Are Rising</p>
<p>Recently, textiles have seen a good price fix due to gold prices soaring. Because of this, they have changed from a falling to rising trend. It has become even better yesterday, with all goods rising. The falling winds have stopped for Lunar Velvet, Black Velvet, and Wave Velvet, which had been falling for a long time. There is a big increase in textile sales. In recent days, the sales of Dark Tianjin and Blue Striped Tianjin, etc., have reached around 2,000 pieces, all of which are being transferred to storage for resale at a higher price. There is a shortage of spot Nanguan flannelette, and prices are soaring. Yesterday, Santan required 3 qian 6 fen, Sima Xiangru 3 qian 6 fen 5 li, First-Class Rich and Noble 3 qian 2 fen, Double Child Deer 3 qian 1 fen, Moganshan requires 3 qian 3 fen 5 li, and the spot goods are still hard to buy. Sanyou Picture has already required 3 qian 0 fen 5 li. Fine serge has risen by 2.5 to 5 li yesterday. Ancient City Association has already opened at 3 qian 4 fen 5 li. Baqiu assorted colors are out of stock. Bald Blue Gray also requires 3 qian 2 fen. Peace, Lake Heart Pavilion, and Happiness all opened at 3 qian. The sentiment in the cotton cloth association market yesterday was very different. Those who had been watching previously are now buying one after another. The inventories of the merchants are now empty. The reason is that the price fix is much higher than the current market price, which has stirred up actual sales.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Ordinary Dried Longan Gradually Becomes Active</h3>
<p>There is quite a lot of ordinary dried longan accumulated before and after, and various stores have not opened for a long time because the sales are not good. Merchants are also watching and hesitating, but recently, although there are not many customers, sporadic transactions are still considerable. Inventory is gradually decreasing, so the intention to import is becoming stronger. It is said that the number of medium and high-grade goods sold in recent days has reached more than 300 boxes, with prices varying from about 23 taels to 20 taels. The market trend is stabilizing.</p>
<h3>Metals: English Steel Sheet Prices Rise, but Transactions Become Lighter</h3>
<p>Since the tightening of foreign exchange rates, the mentality of local colleagues in the English steel sheet business has seen a sharp rise. Therefore, the price for each lot is being increased. The current market price, for example, is 9 taels 5 qian per dan for 2.5 li, 7 taels 2 qian 5 fen for 5 li, 6 taels 7 qian 5 fen for 7.5 li, 6 taels 5 qian for 1 fen, and an estimated 6 taels 4 qian for 1.5 fen and above. However, actual transactions are instead reduced because the price is too high and there are no buyers. It is found that in the past three or four days in the market, in addition to slight patronage from shipyards, etc., in this street, the export customer gangs have not been moved. Overall, the market trend has the appearance of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside.</p>

<h3>Strict Prevention in the City Yesterday</h3>
<p>Slight Disturbances in the Public Concession</p>
<p>All Other Places Were Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday, authorities in both the Chinese and French Concessions received confidential reports beforehand stating that the Communist Party intended to cause trouble, so the entire day was spent on prevention, which was extraordinarily strict. Although there were intermittent disturbances by young people in places like Nanjing Road and Fuzhou Road, because of the strict prevention measures, they were quickly dispersed and did not cause major incidents. The details of yesterday's prevention measures are summarized below.</p>
<p>Chinese Concession: Military, political, and police agencies in the Chinese Concession had received orders on the 9th, so prevention was earlier than in the concessions. Yesterday, in addition to Baoshan Road, Minguo Road, Shiliupu, Xiejiao, the West Gate, and the area along the North Suzhou River, where it borders the concessions, prevention was extremely strict. The armed motorized bicycles of the Municipal Public Security Bureau patrolled back and forth on Minguo Road and Zhonghua Road. Other locations, such as Xiaoximen, Gaochangmiao, and financial and transportation institutions, were also heavily guarded by police. Therefore, there were no disturbances of any kind throughout the day in the northern and southern parts of the Chinese Concession. Although there was a conflict between tram ticket sellers from the Chinese and Public Concessions between Lao Beimen and Xiao Beimen on Minguo Road, it was quickly resolved.</p>
<p>Public Concession: There were slight disturbances yesterday on Nanjing Road and Henan Road in the Public Concession, but other places were very peaceful. In addition to ordering each police station to strengthen prevention, the Shanghai Municipal Police also had patrol cars patrolling the streets for security. Nanjing Road, Xizang Road, and Sichuan Road were particularly watched. The disturbances on Nanjing Road began around 9:30 a.m., from the intersection of Xizang Road to Guangxi Road. Two to three hundred people resembling workers and students gathered. There was a firecracker sound, anti-government slogans were shouted, and red and green leaflets were distributed to each other. Nearby Chinese and Western detectives immediately stepped forward and dispersed the crowd. Six men were arrested because they could not escape, and various leaflets they left behind were taken to the Laoza Police Station. Detectives from the Central Police Station arrested two people and confiscated several leaflets at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Henan Road. Furthermore, a Indian man was arrested by the police station for distributing Chinese anti-British leaflets in the Hongkou District. Among the six people arrested by the Laoza Police Station on Nanjing Road, one was named Wang A'gen, who was the one who set off the firecrackers. He was arrested because he was standing to the right of the patrol officers, resulting in a loud noise.</p>
<p>French Concession: The French Concession bordered the Chinese Concession to the south. In addition to the joint defense by the Vietnamese police and local police at the Zhengjia Wood Bridge, the intersection of Avenue MacMahon, and the southern entrance of Yunnan Road, the iron fence along Minguo Road was fully opened in only two places, Xiejiao and Zhengjia Wood Bridge Street. The rest were either opened with one gate to allow vehicles to pass or opened with side gates for pedestrians. Security was also very strict. It was heard that the concession authorities had ordered amusement venues such as the Great World to close early to prevent accidents.</p>
<h3>Xiong or Hui Yang Yongtai's Medical Treatment is Progressing Well</h3>

<p>American Pilot's Coffin Scheduled to be Shipped to America Today</p>

Zeng Chunfan, Xiong Shihui's guard, suddenly deteriorated from 1:00 AM yesterday. Despite all efforts by the doctors at the Orthopedic Hospital, none were effective. He died at 1:45 PM yesterday. Of the seven people involved in the disaster, five have now died. Xiong Shihui and Yang Yongtai are recovering well. The details of yesterday's situation are described below:</p>

The transcription is as follows: (1) On the 10th, Director Niu Huisheng re-bandaged the wound. Temperature was 100 degrees, pulse 104, respiration 20. However, he still could not urinate on his own. At night, a rubber tube was used to release urine. Due to slight pain in the wound, he could not sleep well. He was immediately injected with a shot and slept peacefully for five hours. On the morning of the 11th, the temperature was 98.8 degrees, pulse 106, respiration 22. His spirits were better than yesterday, with a slight cough. (2) He had a bowel movement on the afternoon of the 11th, with a lot of waste. He could urinate on his own.

The temperature was 99.8 degrees, pulse 108, respiration 20, and the symptoms were less severe than yesterday. (3) Dr. Niu reported at 1:00 AM this morning that the temperature was 99.8 degrees, pulse 108, and respiration 22.</p>

Xiong was able to talk to his family yesterday, but the doctors still prohibited him from speaking. His left arm, like during the diagnosis period, did not show any other effects and will be able to return to its original state in the future. As for the death of Zeng Chunfan, his family kept it a secret for fear of hurting Xiong.</p>

<p>Yang Remains Unchanged: Yang Yongtai's medical treatment yesterday has not undergone any changes. According to the Bao Long Hospital doctor, who spoke to this newspaper's reporter, a detailed examination yesterday revealed that Yang's left rib seemed to have two broken bones, and his lungs were shaken, resulting in a cough with blood. However, there was sometimes no blood in the phlegm. His spirits were still very low, and his left ankle swelling had also slightly subsided. He ate thin porridge and chicken juice. Because the pain in his waist had not healed, he still could not stand up, so an X-ray examination was still needed in a few days. But his life is expected to be saved. The temperature was 37.1 degrees in the morning, the pulse was 104, and the temperature was 36.9 degrees in the afternoon, the pulse was 77. Also, yesterday it was reported that Yang had left the hospital and returned home for recuperation, which is absolutely incorrect.</p>
<p>Guard Dies: Xiong's guard, Zeng Chunfan, had been repeatedly diagnosed and treated, but there was no improvement. He died at 1:45 PM yesterday. According to Dr. Niu's report, Zeng Chunfan was unconscious on the afternoon of the 10th, with a temperature of 99.2 degrees, a pulse of 124, respiration of 28, abdominal distension, and bowel movement still ineffective. He could not eat, so saline glucose was injected through the anus. At about 12:00 AM, he suddenly became delirious, with hiccups and wild hand and foot movements. Director Niu immediately administered a cardiotonic sedative injection, and he felt slightly calmer. At 11:00 AM, he vomited a small amount of blood, the temperature was 102.2 degrees, the pulse was 130, and respiration was 40. His condition worsened, and he died in the hospital at 1:45 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Funeral This Morning: After Zeng Chunfan's death, at 3:00 PM yesterday, Zeng's body was escorted to the Wanguo Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road by members of the Garrison Headquarters Detective Team, and Wang Bin of the Detective Team was responsible for purchasing a coffin worth 200 yuan and burial clothes. The Aviation Corporation also sent a wreath. The funeral will be held at 8:00 AM this morning. All staff members of the Headquarters will attend the funeral. In the future, the coffin will be temporarily housed in the Shaoxing Guild Hall.</p>
<p>Zeng's Brief Biography: Zeng Chunfan was 25 years old, from Jiangxi, with a wife and a nephew. He lived on Ladou Road in Shanghai. His family was very poor. He was brave and responsible and had followed Xiong for four years, deeply winning Xiong's favor. A few years ago, he served as a lieutenant platoon leader in the First Battalion of the Twenty-ninth Regiment. Before long Xiong transferred and promoted him to adjutant and chief guard. Whenever Xiong went in and out, he would always be by his side. His peers all praised him. This time, Xiong went to Gan to assist Chairman Jiang in suppressing the communist bandits. In addition to Zeng, the secretary Li Dezhao accompanied him. Xiong had ordered Zeng Chunfan and Li to take the boat first, but Zeng volunteered to accompany and protect him on the plane to Xun. Unexpectedly, he suffered this disaster, and it was truly tragic. It is said that the colleagues of the Garrison Headquarters will raise funds for condolences to comfort his spirit. The Aviation Corporation will also provide generous pensions. His wife has been in the hospital since the disaster, mourning and fainting several times. When she passed away yesterday afternoon, his wife cried so bitterly that she wanted to die and hit the wall, bleeding. After much persuasion, she calmed down a little.</p>
<p>The Deceased is Coffin: The American driver, Bell, was given a funeral at the Wanguo Funeral Home at 3:00 PM yesterday. In addition to the European war veteran pilots and the deceased's friends, the US Marine Corps and the French Army sent a squad to the funeral, and the US Marine Corps band played music at the scene, never forgetting his service during the European war. Now his remains will be handed over to the President McKinley, which will sail today back to the United States. During the coffining, the Aviation Corporation staff and pilots all went to pay their respects. Minister of Communications Wang Boqun, China National Aviation Corporation and all Chinese pilots all presented a large wreath to express their grief. Also, Russian woman, Mrs. Andefeiyeva, was also given a funeral yesterday. As for Mr. Bian Fugen, he was coffin the day before yesterday and will be transported back to Wuxi for burial in three or four days. The coffin is temporarily housed at the Xijin Guild Hall Pier. The Chinese and foreign colleagues of the Aviation Corporation have voluntarily donated money to help Bian's family.</p>
<p>Lost Items Returned: Passengers Yin Wenlong and Russian woman Andefeiyeva's lost items, Yin's handbag, and An's hand leather bag each, have been received by Director Qi of the company from Deputy Director Jiang of the Garrison Headquarters. Yin's items were transferred by Mr. Ling of the company to inform Yin's family to pick them up, and An's items were kept by American Director Han Milton of the company, waiting for his family to pick them up.</p>
<p>It is also heard that after the accident, the Aviation Corporation immediately sent people to Beijing to report and ask for instructions on the aftermath. According to the company's news yesterday, Minister Wang will come to Shanghai to convene a board of directors meeting to discuss the issues of responsibility, business, and aftermath.</p>
<p>Hankou-Yichang Aviation: According to the Huadong News Agency, the Aviation Corporation originally planned to extend the Shanghai-Chengdu line to Yichang on the 15th of this month, and implement the Hankou-Yichang section. It was also decided to fly with the Shanghai plane that crashed this time. Now that the plane has crashed and destroyed, and the pilots Bell and Bian Fugen have also died, there is a shortage of two pilots, so it is decided to postpone the implementation of the Yichang flight by a few days.</p>

<h3>The Serious Water Price Increase Case</h3>
<p>The Water Company Implements Water Cutoff</p>
<p>The Ratepayers' Association Cables the Government for Negotiation</p>
<p>Standing Committee Meeting Convened This Afternoon</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, based on the audit report of the Water Company's accounts, decided not to recognize the price increase after the Representatives' Conference, the Association immediately followed the resolution to actively handle the matter. The formal letter to the Public Works Department was also sent out yesterday. It is heard that the Water Company is actually implementing coercive measures, cutting off the water supply to users who, in accordance with public opinion, do not pay the increased price, thus arousing great anger among the citizens, who have reported to the Ratepayers' Association one after another. In addition to advising the citizens to take legal measures, the Association has also cabled the government for serious negotiation and will convene a Standing Committee meeting at 12:00 noon today (the 12th) to discuss emergency countermeasures. The relevant documents are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Government: Nanjing to the National Government Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Interior, Shanghai Municipal Government Jian, The British Water Company forced a price increase unsuccessfully, and cut off the water supply today, The lives and safety of millions of residents in the area are in danger, Please negotiate quickly, and take the most effective measures, Restore water supply, to value humanity and maintain the people's lives, no win to the fear of the zhi, Shanghai Concession Ratepayers Association respectfully,</p>
<p>Reports from Various Users: (1) Zhang Tiankai, a resident of Kangnao Road, reported that the water supply to his house was shut off on the morning of the 10th. The water route was blocked by closing the water pipe on the road. Now the house has no water to drink, and there is no water stove nearby to buy cooked water. (2) Four houses of Huashang Villas at No. 1051 to No. 1055, Changchun Lane, Peng Road, and their agency company and residences, were simultaneously shut off by the water company at about 11:00 AM on the 11th, with no water to drink, and their lives are in danger. In addition to reporting to the landlord, this is a special report. (3) All water bills at Nos. 394 and 416 Terrace Road were sent at the old price on the 9th. However, the Water Company refused to accept them and said that if the new price is not submitted before the 15th, the water will be cut off, etc. (4) Shenzhou Grand Hotel reported that the Water Company specially sent a bill collector to the hotel, claiming that he had received the order from the company's general manager to limit the payment of the new price today, otherwise the water would be cut off tomorrow, as a threat. (5) Wang Yutai Tea House and Huiquan Bathhouse also received notices from the Water Company at the same time yesterday, limiting the payment of the new price before the 15th, otherwise the water will be cut off, etc.</p>
<p>Meeting This Afternoon: Based on the above reports from various users, the Association decided to convene a Standing Committee meeting at 12:00 noon today to discuss emergency countermeasures, setting up a law to restore the water supply from the Water Company and at the same time ordering it to bear the various losses incurred by the users due to the water cut.</p>
<p>Letter to the Public Works Department: The Association sent a letter to the Public Works Department Board of Directors of the Public Concession yesterday, saying: Dear Sirs, Approved by the Board of Directors of your Bureau, Mr. Fei Xindun, President, replied to this Association's letter of September 16 on September 25 this year. The contents of the original letter of this Association were slightly misunderstood. Moreover, without discussing the reply of Mr. Jones, Deputy Director of your Bureau, to this Association's letter of November 10 regarding the Water Company's water cut-off on November 14 this year, it is said that according to the contract, if users refuse to pay the water price approved by your Bureau, the Water Company has the right to cut off the water. His mind only cares about the interests of the Water Company and puts the interests of the taxpayers represented by your Bureau out of bounds, the seriousness of its impact, how can it be imagined, According to the water company increased water charges, what is the opinion of taxpayers on this, certified by the attitude of the Chinese and foreign owners association and the Shanghai Real Estate Association, it can be imagined, This Association, as the representative body of Chinese taxpayers, should exercise the rights of taxpayers, Therefore, on September 16 this year, a letter was sent to your Bureau and requested that the Chinese Directors propose that the case be reconsidered. It was originally hoped that your Bureau would take into account the situation and revoke the previous resolution. It is regrettable that your Bureau still decided to maintain the original case. It is found that the current contract signed by your Bureau and the Shanghai Water Company is somewhat biased towards the interests of the company's shareholders, and it is necessary to amend it immediately. The detailed reasons are as follows: (1) The dividends and bonuses of Class A shares issued by the Water Company averaged 10.67% per year from 1918 to 1927, and averaged 9.22% per year from 1923 to 1927. Now your Bureau allows the Water Company to sell water in the concession and divide 9% of the dividends of Class A shares each year, and the Water Company's net profit from selling water outside the concession to ships, etc., can also be distributed to shareholders as bonuses. This bonus was 1.56% in 1928 and 1.29% in 1929, so Class A shares actually received dividends and bonuses, which were 10.56% in 1928 and 10.29% in 1929, which is very little different from the average rate of the ten years before the contract was signed, and the average rate of the five years before the contract was signed has actually increased. Moreover, the Water Company originally had no fixed amount of dividends issued each year. Since the current contract stipulates a high dividend of 9%, the Water Company's shares have been given an additional guarantee. In the first half of this year, the selling price of this stock in London was about 25 pounds, which is 25% out of its face value. This is clear evidence that general investors believe that the dividends are generous. (2) In the past, the water price in the concession was limited, and the Water Company's dividends were not fixed. At that time, the Water Company issued bonus shares, which did not cause much harm to the public interest. The more bonus shares issued, the lower the average dividend per share of the Water Company's stock will be, and the burden on users may not increase as a result. Now your Bureau gives a guaranteed interest of 9% to the Water Company's Class A shares, whether they are original shares or bonus shares, which is tantamount to allowing the Water Company to profit on top of profit, and its increase in the burden on users is obvious. It is found that the Water Company issued 60,960 pounds of bonus shares in 1921. After signing the draft contract with your Bureau on September 28, 1926, it re-issued 134,120 pounds of bonus shares in December of the same year. Your Bureau's current contract with the Water Company on March 17, 1928, all allows a guaranteed interest of 9% for this bonus share, with the same treatment as the rest of the Class A original shares. And the Water Company could not issue the 9% dividend of the original shares and bonus shares in 1927, your Bureau also allows it to withdraw a part from the net profit of 1928 to issue to make up for it. The audited Class A shares of the Water Company actually account for 70% of its current total share capital, and the above-mentioned two issues of bonus shares actually account for 24% of the Class A shares. The rated 9% dividend of all bonus shares requires 17,517 pounds and 4 shillings per year. Calculated at 1 shilling and 6 pence per tael of quyuan, it requires 234,096 taels of silver. Last year, the income dividends and bonuses of Class A shares totaled 10.29%. If this 24% of bonus shares is excluded from the calculation, the income dividends of the original Class A shares actually reached a huge amount of 13.5%, and its benefits are known to be generous. (3) Before your Bureau and the Water Company signed the draft contract in 1926, the Water Appliances Department was still a part of the Water Company, its property was the property of the Water Company, and its profits were also the profits of the Water Company. Now your Bureau allows it to be independent as a branch company, and distributes the shares of the new company to the Class A shareholders of the Water Company at that time, ostensibly to avoid the monopoly of the Water Company or have the disadvantages of the appliance business in the concession. In fact, the current Shanghai Water Appliances Co., Ltd. is still related to the Water Company, but its annual profits are no longer included in the profits of the Water Company. Then, the dividends of the appliance company are another kind of extra income for the original Class A shareholders of the Water Company. It can be seen from the above that the current contract is not only one point of preferential treatment for the company's original Class A shares. The company has been established for nearly 50 years, and its business is definitely not dangerous, not to mention. Your Bureau has signed such favorable conditions with a company that operates a daily necessities business and enjoys patent rights, which is a very improper bureau. Article 27 of the current contract originally has a provision that can be amended. Now that it has been found that this contract is biased towards the interests of the Water Company's shareholders, and has not given sufficient protection to the welfare of Chinese and foreign residents, your Bureau should consult and amend the contract with the Water Company as soon as possible in accordance with Article 27 of the contract to seek remedies, reduce the rated dividends of the Water Company's Class A shares, and cancel the rated dividends of the bonus shares issued by the company to reduce the burden on all residents in the concession. Now, according to the report of the representatives sent by the Association to the Water Company to check the accounts, since 1927, the various expenses of the Water Company, such as the salaries of the management office, etc., have been greatly increased. The company's accumulated public funds are limited due to the sharp increase in expenses in recent years. The opportunity to increase the price of gold has an impact on the number of minutes of rated dividends. This time, the company's request for a price increase is specifically from the perspective of developing new sources of revenue in order to remedy it, and it has never considered saving on expenses. Your Bureau should investigate the accounts of the Water Company at any time in the future in accordance with Article 23 of the contract and urge the company to save expenses for adjustment. Furthermore, the various dividends of the Water Company stipulated in Article 10 of the contract were originally cumulative dividends and did not have to be refunded every year. If the dividends this year are insufficient, they can be reissued next year. It is found that your Bureau and the Water Company had previously agreed that the original water price would not be changed before the end of June 1931, and Article 13, Section 2 of the contract stipulates that if the Water Company wants to change the water price, it must agree with your Bureau at least five months in advance before it can be implemented. This time, the water price was increased from September 1, which was hastily proposed by the Water Company, and your Bureau also hastily agreed to it, which was originally inconsistent with the provisions of Article 13 of the contract. Therefore, the increase in water price is an extra profit outside the contract for the Water Company, a special accommodation outside the contract for your Bureau, and a burden outside the contract for users. It is natural for them to oppose the price increase. Your Bureau has a responsibility to protect the interests of users, and should consult with the Water Company to amend the contract, save expenses, cancel the price increase, and charge the original fees in accordance with the opinions of taxpayers in order to live up to the trust of taxpayers. Otherwise, the current price increase issue may cause a major dispute, and your Bureau cannot shirk its responsibility. To the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Public Concession,</p>

Now your Bureau allows it to be independent as a branch company, and distributes the shares of the new company to the Class A shareholders of the Water Company at that time, ostensibly to avoid the monopoly of the Water Company or have the disadvantages of the appliance business in the concession. In fact, the current Shanghai Water Appliances Co., Ltd. is still related to the Water Company, but its annual profits are no longer included in the profits of the Water Company. Then, the dividends of the appliance company are another kind of extra income for the original Class A shareholders of the Water Company. It can be seen from the above that the current contract is not only one point of preferential treatment for the company's original Class A shares. The company has been established for nearly 50 years, and its business is definitely not dangerous, not to mention. Your Bureau has signed such favorable conditions with a company that operates a daily necessities business and enjoys patent rights, which is a very improper bureau. Article 27 of the current contract originally has a provision that can be amended. Now that it has been found that this contract is biased towards the interests of the Water Company's shareholders, and has not given sufficient protection to the welfare of Chinese and foreign residents, your Bureau should consult and amend the contract with the Water Company as soon as possible in accordance with Article 27 of the contract to seek remedies, reduce the rated dividends of the Water Company's Class A shares, and cancel the rated dividends of the bonus shares issued by the company to reduce the burden on all residents in the concession. Now, according to the report of the representatives sent by the Association to the Water Company to check the accounts, since 1927, the various expenses of the Water Company, such as the salaries of the management office, etc., have been greatly increased. The company's accumulated public funds are limited due to the sharp increase in expenses in recent years. The opportunity to increase the price of gold has an impact on the number of minutes of rated dividends. This time, the company's request for a price increase is specifically from the perspective of developing new sources of revenue in order to remedy it, and it has never considered saving on expenses. Your Bureau should investigate the accounts of the Water Company at any time in the future in accordance with Article 23 of the contract and urge the company to save expenses for adjustment. Furthermore, the various dividends of the Water Company stipulated in Article 10 of the contract were originally cumulative dividends and did not have to be refunded every year. If the dividends this year are insufficient, they can be reissued next year. It is found that your Bureau and the Water Company had previously agreed that the original water price would not be changed before the end of June 1931, and Article 13, Section 2 of the contract stipulates that if the Water Company wants to change the water price, it must agree with your Bureau at least five months in advance before it can be implemented. This time, the water price was increased from September 1, which was hastily proposed by the Water Company, and your Bureau also hastily agreed to it, which was originally inconsistent with the provisions of Article 13 of the contract. Therefore, the increase in water price is an extra profit outside the contract for the Water Company, a special accommodation outside the contract for your Bureau, and a burden outside the contract for users. It is natural for them to oppose the price increase. Your Bureau has a responsibility to protect the interests of users, and should consult with the Water Company to amend the contract, save expenses, cancel the price increase, and charge the original fees in accordance with the opinions of taxpayers in order to live up to the trust of taxpayers. Otherwise, the current price increase issue may cause a major dispute, and your Bureau cannot shirk its responsibility. To the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Public Concession,</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Hosts Banquet for British Economic Mission</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce last night hosted a banquet at its restaurant for the British Economic Mission. All members of the mission and over sixty Chinese and foreign guests attended. The Chairman of the Chamber, Wang Xiaolai, and the General Manager, Zheng Chengqing, extended warm hospitality. During the banquet, Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech, which is recorded below:</p>
<p>Sir Thomson, the leader of the British Far East Economic Survey Mission, and all members of the mission, have graciously accepted our Chamber's invitation today. This provides a welcome opportunity for commercial representatives of both countries to gather and discuss matters over drinks. It is indeed a pleasure. China and your country have had a commercial treaty for eighty-eight years, and your country has always held an important commercial position in China. Why is it that only this year has a Far East Economic Survey Mission been organized, attracting such deep attention from both the political and business circles of your country? The reason, of course, is that since the European War, newly emerging industrial and commercial nations have flooded the Far East market, especially the Chinese market, with their goods. This has gradually made your country feel uneasy about its trade position in the Far East. Evidence of this is the report of the British Department of Labour in September, which showed that the number of unemployed had reached over 2.1 million. This serious impact on the economic sector cannot be ignored. Therefore, your country has convened an Imperial Conference to increase export trade between the mother country and its colonies, and has also organized a Far East Economic Survey Mission to restore the Far East market that has been built up over decades. This action is indeed taken in response to a serious environment. We have heard that your mission first went to Japan, seemingly only to investigate its large-scale production situation and its organizational methods, as reference material after returning home, and as a return courtesy for the 1922 Japanese mission to the UK. Therefore, this task can also be called a secondary task. As for the task of coming to China this time, it is to study the competitive position of British companies in the Chinese market, and to propose various appropriate methods to restore its former major trade position, in accordance with the instructions of your government. In short, the focus of this Far East Economic Survey Mission is actually in China. It would not be wrong to call it a purely Chinese economic survey mission. Therefore, our Chamber is increasingly aware of the importance of your mission and the close economic relationship between China and Britain, which is actually greater than that between your country and Japan. Chinese industry is in the construction era, and your country's steel and textile machinery are famous in the world market, and are the goods that our country urgently needs at present. In addition, China and Britain have had commercial relations for eighty or ninety years and are old friends in commerce. If we can understand the importance of our respective economic positions and implement the spirit of mutual benefit and cooperation, our Chamber dares to assert that your mission's task will be able to achieve its intended goal. Our Chamber has also heard that your mission plans to stay in China for three months. You will first conduct a detailed survey in Shanghai and its neighboring areas for one month. The second month you will go to Beiping, Tianjin, and Liaoning. The third month you will go to South China. Such a zoned detailed survey is necessary because the commercial situation is extremely complex and cannot be understood by a hasty visit. The needs of sellers and the convenience of sellers vary in each region, and it is difficult to find appropriate solutions without zoned surveys. However, our Chamber believes that in addition to investigating the needs of sellers and the convenience of sellers, your mission must also understand the ordinary psychology and ordinary hopes of the Chinese people in order to reach the stage of success. The ordinary psychology and ordinary hopes of the Chinese people are very frank and very simple, that is, the rights of commerce between the two countries stipulated in the treaty should be mutually respected. It is not permissible to set up various restrictions outside the treaty, making them feel inconvenient to reside and do business, so that the word "commerce" becomes a one-sided and monopolistic business. Our Chamber believes that this situation is related to the feelings of all Chinese people and to the overall situation of British trade with China. Therefore, we have to present several important facts to your mission for reporting: (1) Australia requires overseas Chinese entering the country to have their fingerprints taken and does not allow the wives and children of overseas Chinese to enter the country. Furthermore, Chinese engaged in business are not allowed to add new shareholders to inherit the business. (2) Canada has a special immigration law for overseas Chinese. Since the implementation of this regulation, only four Chinese have been granted special permission to reside in the country. Restrictions are placed on merchants importing goods, requiring them to have a capital of more than US$2,500, and to exclusively trade in Chinese-Canadian local products. In practice, even if they have the qualifications mentioned above, they are not allowed to enter. In addition, Chinese people are prohibited from employing white women as waitresses in restaurants, factories are not allowed to employ Chinese workers, restrictions are placed on Chinese people purchasing property, and restrictions are placed on the issuance of business licenses to Chinese merchants. For example, in the case of Chinese grocery stores in Vancouver, there were 88 in 1920 and only 37 in 1928. (3) In South Africa, Chinese people are not allowed to reside or do business in areas where gold mines are discovered. Furthermore, when property is transferred, it must be stated in the contract that the property cannot be rented to Chinese people for residence. The former is called the Gold Law and the latter is called the Private City Law. In the past two years, the issuance of mining business licenses to Chinese people has been suspended for 116 cases, and this year the South African Congress has proposed a draft law on Asian debt residence, which limits the operation of Chinese stores in the gold zone to five years. (4) In London, it is extremely difficult for Chinese restaurants to obtain permission from the British authorities to recruit new chefs from China. Therefore, the people of our country generally have a feeling that in recent years, the British mainland and its colonies have recognized that China has a vast territory and abundant resources, a dense population, and that industry is just beginning. It is truly the world's leading market, and various investigation teams have been organized to promote or restore their commerce with China. The first priority is to maintain the feelings of 400 million customers. The most effective way to maintain feelings is to practice what our country's ancient saying calls a "forgiveness" character. The true meaning of forgiveness is that I do not want others to treat me in this way, nor do I want to treat others in this way. The various methods mentioned above that restrict the residence and business of Chinese people. If our country also takes similar actions, I believe that it is definitely not what the overseas Chinese businessmen would be willing to endure. Therefore, thinking from the perspective of others, this kind of action is enough to arouse unpleasant feelings among all Chinese people and create reefs for the future of commerce between the two countries. Our Chamber also knows that the Anglo-Saxon nation is the most observant and discerning nation. When any problem arises, they can foresee the consequences and respond appropriately. Evidence of this is that your country was the first to abandon the Hankou and Jiujiang concessions in China, which is the best way to understand the national character of the Chinese people and sympathize with their legitimate demands. We cannot but consider your country to be the first. The above-mentioned methods of restricting the residence and business of Chinese people were caused by many mistakes made by a part of narrow-minded politicians in the past because the people of the two countries did not have the opportunity to shake hands and meet frankly. Not only did they inherit and follow these mistakes, but they continued to be unchanged, and even became more and more new, changing their essence and intensifying them. For the sake of the friendship and future of the people of the two countries, it is truly regrettable and we cannot but hope that your mission will find a way to correct them. The future economic development path of your country, as well as the solution to the unemployment problem, and the restoration of Lancashire's cotton market in the Far East, first lies in winning the broad sympathy of 400 million Chinese people. Restricting the freedom of overseas Chinese to reside and do business in various parts of the UK stems from racial prejudice, and is nominally aimed at excluding people of color, but in fact it is no different from centering on the Chinese people. This is especially what the people of our country have been unable to tolerate for a long time. Therefore, if this point is not resolved, the commercial exchanges between the two countries will never be in a complete and prosperous position. Our Chamber has heard that your delegation leader, when ordered to investigate, once said, "Now each of us members bears a heavy responsibility. This is entrusted to us by the government. Now we should study the causes of the current difficulties. We hope that when we return home, we will not only be able to report the hopes and needs of the Far East market to the British business community in detail, but also try to overcome many current obstacles to commercial difficulties in order to live up to this trip." Therefore, our Chamber would like to make a simple request: "That is to correct all the unequal restrictions that the UK has always treated overseas Chinese, so that they have the freedom to reside and do business." This is the ardent hope and need of the people of our country, and it is also the key for your country to maintain the feelings of the Chinese people and restore the Far East market. We hope that after returning home, you will make a sincere statement to the authorities and business circles in your country, and do your best to correct the mistakes of the past. Even if there are obstacles, you should unite with just public opinion and find ways to overcome them. Then your mission's task in China this time will definitely achieve satisfactory results. I would like to offer a toast to the promotion of friendship between the merchants of the two countries, the smooth progress of your mission's investigation, and the health of everyone present.</p>

<h3>Wu Suzhou's Extradition</h3>
<p>Delivered to Wang Bin in Court Yesterday</p>
<p>To be Investigated by the Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>Wu Suzhou, a former field reporter for the Shishi News, was originally an alias of the communist Hu Yu. He participated in the communist bandit riot in Fengxian. On August 1st of this autumn, he was discovered by detectives from the Garrison Headquarters on Nanjing Road. He was sent to the Special District Local Court by the police to be transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation. Because the suspect refused to accept this, he filed an appeal, so he was temporarily detained by the police. Until the 24th of last month, the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court rejected his appeal. The police then consulted with the headquarters on the extradition procedures and the timing. Recently, it was decided to allow the delivery in court on the 11th to be taken away. Yesterday morning, on schedule, the police brought the suspect to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Court, and Wang Bin, a detective specially sent by the headquarters, arrived as scheduled. Soon, Judge Xu Jiashi took the seat. After the police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the circumstances of the case, Judge Xu ruled, Wu Suzhou should be handed over to the detective to take him away for investigation. The suspect still wanted to request the court clerk to read the testimony of the witness Bao Junfu in the record. Judge Xu ruled that it was not necessary to read the testimony because it was not a trial. If you want to know what the witness said, you can pay the transcription fee and request a transcription according to the law. Wu did not object much. He was taken down by the police and handed over to Detective Wang to be taken back to the headquarters for detention and investigation.</p>
<h3>Extortionists Demand 60,000 from Salesman</h3>
<p>Salesman is Unable to Pay</p>
<p>Extortionists Persist in Harassment</p>
<p>Fourth Meeting Between the Two Sides</p>
<p>Detectives Arrest Two People on the Spot</p>
<p>Zhang Muhan, a local salesman for the Jiangxi Kangyuan Can Factory, who lives at No. 34 Haining Road, received a letter delivered by mail on the morning of the 4th of this month. Upon opening it, it turned out to be from extortionists, demanding 60,000 yuan. They said that if he agreed to pay the full amount, they would put a red strip on the garbage can in front of his door. If he agreed to give 50,000 yuan, they would put a yellow strip; 40,000 a blue strip; 30,000 a white strip; 20,000 a black strip. If he did not agree, there was no need to paste anything. Zhang laughed it off. The next day, he continued to receive a letter from the extortionists, asking him to send someone with a newspaper as a marker to wait by the copper railing on the Bund. Someone would come to negotiate. The letter was signed Zhao from Qinghefang, Fuzhou Road. Zhang still ignored it. On the afternoon of the 6th, at 4:00 p.m., Zhang's maid, Gao Liu, went out to get water and met a man with a pockmarked face, who asked if she was Zhang's maid. He then took out a red invitation card and gave it to the woman, saying that Mr. Li invited your master to a banquet. You must tell him when you return, and do not break the appointment. Later, Zhang returned home from the factory and saw that there was a letter inside the invitation, asking him to go to the clock opposite the Great World at 2:00 or 3:00 p.m. on the 8th to negotiate. The person who went should carry a newspaper as a marker. If he still ignored it, they would take drastic measures. Zhang then ordered his relative Wang Bingsheng to go to the designated place. After a while, two men came and asked if he was Zhang's representative. They invited him to a private room on the sixth floor of the Da Zhonghua Hotel to negotiate. There were already two people waiting in the room. Wang then said to them, Zhang's family is not wealthy. One or two hundred gold dollars can barely be raised, but tens of thousands are really beyond our ability. They were unwilling to lower the price. Wang returned and reported to Zhang, letting him live or die. On the 9th, another letter from the extortionists was received, changing the appointment to 3:00 p.m. on the 10th at the corner of Changbang Road and Hardoon Road to discuss the matter. Zhang reported it to the Hongkou Police Station because the bandits were constantly harassing him and the wording was becoming more and more threatening. Detective Wei Jinfu, Detective Wang Runhe, and Detective Sun Baozhong, led by Wang Bingsheng, went to the agreed place. Wang stood upright and waited with a paper bag. The detectives disguised themselves and scattered around. Two men came in time and were arrested by the detectives and taken back to the police station. After questioning, they were named Zhang Jinfu and Chen Liansheng, both local. Yesterday, they were sent to the Special District Local Court. Judge Ge interrogated them. Zhang submitted the four letters he had received and explained the circumstances. Wang Bingsheng testified in court that both defendants were present during the previous negotiations. Zhang Jinfu confessed that he was instructed by Miao Lao San. Chen Liansheng confessed that he was invited by Zhang and did not know much about the extortion. The court ordered the two defendants to be detained for another hearing at a later date.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Arrests Four Notorious Robbers</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau's lead detective, Gao Wansheng, leading detectives Gu Liancheng, Wu Xiufeng, and others, were inspecting pedestrians in the Xinbeimen area when they noticed four people walking from the French Concession. Their demeanor was unusually suspicious. The detectives knew they were not good people, so they secretly followed them. Meanwhile, they borrowed a telephone nearby and reported directly to the bureau, and further dispatched detectives Shan Bin, He Haifa, Wu Zuorong, Han Jingxiang, Li Xiaobao, Zhang Xinlong, Li Yongfu, Yan Zhuming, Ding Shunbao, Zhou Peisan, Gao Juchuan, and Yang Liancheng, etc., under the command of lead detective Gao, secretly followed them to the entrance of No. 42 Ham Alley inside Dadongmen. The four, on the pretext of asking directions, rushed into No. 42. Seeing this, the detectives surrounded the house. Unexpectedly, the four were robbers planning a robbery. When they realized that someone was surrounding them outside, they panicked and tried to escape, but none of them escaped and were all captured. They were taken to the bureau for strict interrogation. One confessed to being Huang Guochen, 24 years old, from Liangshan, Sichuan; one was Wang Ziqing, 38 years old, from Yichang, Hubei; one was Zhou Huasheng, 21 years old, also from Yichang; and one was Zhou Linsheng, 33 years old, from Fenghua.

Then, together with the Public Concession Police, they went to Hengsheng Pawnshop at No. 422 Guangdong Road and retrieved the original stolen grey squirrel coat. After questioning all the criminals, they were immediately sent to the Judicial Section for interrogation.</p>
<h3>House Collapse in the City, Fortunately No One Injured</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, the Jiang Shunxing Iron Shop, owned by Jiang Zhou (74 years old, from Wuxi), located at No. 656-658 Fangbang Road in the city, collapsed. The shop was a single-story building, built by Jiang Zhou on rented land from a certain family. It was old and had been repeatedly ordered to be demolished and rebuilt by the Municipal Works Bureau. Recently, although Jiang Zhou had moved out in preparation for demolition, the house suddenly collapsed. At that time, Hongtao, the twelve-year-old son of Dai Chaoqi, who lived across the street at No. 663, was passing by while soaking in water, and was hit by the collapsed wall, injuring his left leg and face. Jiang Zhenshan, the police officer from the First Branch of the Second District, arrived after hearing the alarm, and immediately rescued the injured boy, Dai Hongtao, took him to the station, and then sent him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, the injuries were not serious. Director Qian ordered the homeowner, Jiang Zhou, to come to the station for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Romantic Woman, Borrow or Steal?</h3>
<p>Zhou Guibao's Nonsense Behavior</p>
<p>Zhou Yugao, who lives at No. 26 Wuyuan Road in the city and makes dominoes, has a daughter named Zhou Guibao, who is twenty years old and naturally romantic. At the age of seventeen, she fell in love with Wang Shaofang, a film actor, and they became inseparable, eventually living together for three years. They have a son who is not yet one year old. Unexpectedly, Guibao liked the new and abandoned the old, and had an affair with someone else. She hired someone to separate from Wang Shaofang, the child was to be raised by Wang, and Guibao paid Wang 70 yuan to settle the matter. Wang was friends with Li Sha, who lives at No. 2 Dingxiang Lane behind the Slaughterhouse Company in the French Concession and works for Yong'an Life Insurance Company, so Zhou Guibao and Li Qian, Li Sha's wife, became good friends. However, it was not known that Zhou and Wang had already separated. The other day (the 6th), at 8:00 PM, Zhou Guibao went to Li Sha's house to play. That night, she slept on Li Sha's bed. At dawn, she went to empty the chamber pot and took the opportunity to steal Li Qian's black velvet coat, wool serge cheongsam, gold watch, gold ring, silver bracelet, as well as 62 yuan in cash, 7 yuan in change, and other miscellaneous items and ran away. When Li Qian got up and found out, she and her husband Li Sha went to find Wang Shaofang. Wang said they had separated but only knew that her father lived in the city. So, they went to Zhou Yugao's house to look for her. Unexpectedly, Zhou Yugao instead demanded that Li Sha return his daughter Guibao, so he called the police and brought them to the Second Branch of the Second District. Later, Li's wife met Zhou Guibao in Tangjiawan and immediately dragged her to the police station. After questioning by Director Guo, Li Sha confessed to the theft of clothing and money. According to Zhou Guibao, she only admitted to borrowing the clothes and did not steal the money and clothing, and was willing to return them. Li Sha, because he had known Guibao for many years, did not want to press charges, so she was sentenced to five days of detention as a warning and sent to the Second District Headquarters for detention.</p>
<h3>Family Troubles Cause Suffocation and Death</h3>
<p>Liu Renqing, from Zhenjiang, is 50 years old. He used to be a technician at the Meihuali Watch Factory on Tiantong'an Road. Later, he established his own Yiheyong Watch Shop on North Sichuan Road. Because of poor business, he lost a lot of money. Then he moved to No. 239 Henan Road, and business gradually improved. When Liu was young, he married Zhao from the same hometown. She is now 46 years old. At that time, although Liu was doing business in Shanghai, his family was poor, and she was still farming in the countryside. Later, Liu falsely claimed in Shanghai that he had no family and married Chen, a local woman, as his wife. She is now 46 years old. She had several acres of land outside the West Gate, which she sold to provide for Liu's shop. Not long after, Zhao learned that her husband had established a shop in Shanghai, so she braved everything to come to Shanghai to rely on him. Only then did Chen realize the truth, but what was done could not be undone. Zhao was particularly fierce, and Chen was bullied by her. Liu was also afraid of her like a tiger, so quarrels were often heard. Two or three years ago, Zhao and Chen had another dispute, and Chen angrily returned to her hometown. Before leaving, she said to Liu, "Unless you are seriously ill, I will never come to Shanghai again," etc. Since then, for several years, the two sides were at peace. He only remitted a certain amount of living expenses each month. Recently, Liu was suffering from severe stomach pain due to the increasing complexity of his affairs and was recuperating at Room 70 of the Huashang Hotel on Haining Road. He wrote to Zhao in his hometown. The next day, Zhao took a car to Shanghai, but instead of going to the hotel to see Liu, she went straight to the shop and quarreled with Chen, beating her severely, and insisted on demanding 10,000 yuan for alimony before she would stop. Soon after, Liu Renqing found out about it and was extremely depressed. Yesterday afternoon, he wanted to get up to defecate, but suffocated and fell to the ground and died. Later, he was sent to Tongren Hospital by car, and then to the morgue for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Hu Tongfu Dies of Syphilis</h3>
<p>There was a man named Hu Tongfu, it is not known who he was, nor is his residence known. The other day, he was walking alone on Nanjing Road when he suddenly fell. A police officer saw him and asked what was wrong. Hu said that he was too ill to get up. So, he was taken to Renji Hospital by car. After examination by the doctor, there were no symptoms, but he suffered from severe syphilis, especially in the lower body. He was in the third stage and incurable. He was allowed to stay in the hospital for treatment, hoping for a miracle. Unexpectedly, he died suddenly at 1:30 PM the day before yesterday. The police station sent a detective to carry his body to the morgue. Yesterday, Judge Guo from the Special District Court visited the morgue for an autopsy and ordered that the body be collected by Pushan Villa.</p>
<h3>Sampan Sunk by Tugboat Wake</h3>
<p>Passenger Zheng Shaowu Suffers Fatal Plunge</p>
<p>The night before last at 6:00 PM, seven employees of the Taikoo Company's Qingyuan steamer hired a sampan from the company's Huatong Wharf in Lanni Ferry, Pudong, to cross the river. When it approached the Ningshao Wharf on Dongmen Road on the opposite bank, a tugboat of the Dalai Company was speeding north at full speed. Where it passed, the waves were surging. The sampan was hit head-on and was overturned by the huge wave. All seven passengers and the boatman fell into the river. Four of them were good swimmers and did not sink. At this critical moment, another sampan came rowing and rescued six passengers and the boatman. However, passenger Zheng Shaowu suffered a fatal plunge and his body disappeared without a trace. Yesterday, Zheng's colleague Gao Sida reported to the Water Police Station to look out for the body.</p>
<h3>Continued Report on the False Search of Communist Party Case</h3>
<p>The case of Chen Tingxun suing Chen Yong has already been reported yesterday. It is now known that No. 275 Zhejiang Road is a large building with many rooms upstairs. Room 68 is rented out and used as the Meilun English Night School. The tuition is low, only one yuan every six months. Many people go there to study, hoping to learn English and find a job more easily. Recently, Chen Yongshui saw this and coveted it. He also rented Rooms 69 and 71 upstairs and established the Xin Xin Voluntary School, advertising for students and claiming to have professors from England, America, France, Japan, and other countries. Students could graduate in six months and speak directly with Westerners. All students had to pay only one yuan for paper, etc. His wording was quite consistent with the school's name. Young people and children who could not afford to study all signed up. In a few days, there were more than 200 people. Unexpectedly, after the start of classes, Chen suddenly announced that each student had to pay one yuan per month in tuition. The students were in an uproar, saying that Chen was cheating. Then, they secretly discussed transferring to Meilun, which only cost one yuan every six months in the next room. The other day, more than 20 students from Xin Xin discussed the transfer with the Meilun teacher Zhang Ye, etc. Chen Yongshui heard about it and went to the Meilun classroom with his accountant Huang Bingqing and a Westerner to negotiate. He falsely claimed to be Chinese and Western detectives from the police station, accusing the students of holding secret meetings and plotting rebellion. Without any explanation, he conducted an unauthorized search, causing a disturbance, and left. Afterwards, the students reported to the Laozha Police Station, and detectives Liu Chunshu and Western Detective Chief Gelaobo arrested Chen Yongshui. Later, Huang Bingqing was also arrested. Both were sent to the Special District Court. Judge Luo questioned them once and ordered them to be detained pending further investigation and another hearing.</p>

This time, due to the merger of the two ministries, he was transferred to the Ministry of Industry. The central government knows people and makes good use of them, and Minister Kong is experienced. The masses are looking forward to and admiring the new future. We suddenly saw a telegram of resignation in the newspaper and were deeply shocked.

<h3>Chu Minyi Can Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow Morning</h3>

<h3>Various Trade Associations Refuse to Solicit Bonds</h3>
<p>Because Trade Regulations Have Not Been Approved by the Government</p>
<p>The Pawnshop Trade Association yesterday submitted a report to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce stating: In response, we received your letter dated November 29th, stating that your association had approved the letter from the Bond Solicitation Committee of the Ministry of Finance, instructing us to change the 19th Year Short-Term Customs Treasury Bonds to 19th Year Post-War Short-Term Treasury Bonds, urging our association to subscribe for 6,000 yuan and pay it by the deadline, etc. At the same time, we also received a letter from the Bond Solicitation Committee of the Ministry of Finance with the same request. We checked and found that most of our members are from the Chinese area, while members from the British and French Concessions have not all joined the association. We are restricted by the regulations of the Industry and Commerce Trade Association Law, which do not allow us to force members to join the association, and we are further restricted by the trade regulations of the trade association that have been rejected by the ministry. Therefore, we cannot force members to implement the matters discussed in the association. Based on the above situation, the matter of soliciting bond subscriptions has encountered major difficulties. In fact, we cannot make non-member companies subscribe, and in reason, we cannot make member companies, which have already joined, bear huge sums independently. Moreover, the business scope of our members is very small, and the various expenses are very large. The current economic situation is difficult. We are not like those special positions held by companies in concessions. The business development is also higher. Therefore, we are writing a letter detailing the difficulties in soliciting bond subscriptions, and we pray that your association will forward it to the Bond Solicitation Committee of the Ministry of Finance and grant us your understanding. If the issue of trade regulations is approved by the higher authorities in the future, we will then find a way to solicit subscriptions.</p>

Chen Zhonggao was elected as the director of the preparatory committee, with Wang Lianfang, Yu Hualong, Wu Peiyin, Wang Shijia, He Pinglong, Zhu Shunlin, Chen Siyu, etc. as members of the preparatory committee. (2) Wang Xi and the director of the preparatory committee proposed to decide on the date of the general meeting. It was decided that the general membership meeting would be held on January 4, 1921, and a letter should be prepared to borrow the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, and a notice should be published in the newspaper. (3) The membership certificates have not been issued due to the long-term recruitment of members. It was decided that the old chairman would still stamp the certificates for immediate distribution. (4) For those recruitment team leaders who have not submitted enough points, it was decided that a letter would be sent to the secretary, Wu Chongchen, to collect them. (5) Before the general meeting, the handling of association affairs is complicated and the copying is insufficient. Please assign someone to copy.

All have replied and Chairman Jiang has approved the urgent implementation by the fellow villagers. (7) In the case of the loss of an apprentice by fellow villager Zhou Zhenying, the association committee previously resolved that Zhou should republish the advertisement and widely post notices to search in detail. Now, Zhou Zhenying reported to the association again that he had been ordered by the Fenghua County Government to summon him for questioning and requested assistance. It was resolved by the association that Zhou should file a lawsuit with the Shanghai Special District Court, stating that the incident occurred in Shanghai. The association will also send a letter to the Fenghua County Government, requesting consideration. (8) Fellow villagers reported that bandits in Fenghua are still rampant and requested assistance. It was decided that another letter would be sent to the commander of the four prefectures of Ning, Shao, Tai, and Wen to suppress the bandits within a time limit. The meeting adjourned after six o'clock.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Having read the continued report on the Shanghai-Hankou plane crash in your paper on the 11th of this month, I find that the cause of the accident is inconsistent with the facts. The Shanghai plane originally had two pilot seats and six passenger seats. Recently, it has often been full when flying between Shanghai and Hankou and has been able to take off without problems. This time, because the Nanjing station had already sold one passenger ticket from Nanjing to Hankou, only five passengers were carried when flying from Shanghai, leaving one seat to be filled in Nanjing. Therefore, when taking off, it had not yet reached the quota of passengers. The mail carried was also the same as usual, so it could not have been overweight. I think it is a misunderstanding. I am writing to ask you to check and correct it. Sincerely, China National Aviation Corporation, December 11, 1920</p>
<p>Note: This news item was translated from the Greater America Evening Post and was not obtained by our newspaper through its own reporting. We hereby declare this.</p>
<p>To the Editor: In the local news column of your newspaper on the 11th, there was a report about the marital dispute involving our company's actress, Song Meiling. After investigation, there is no actress named Song Meiling in our company. Please correct this. Sincerely, Star Film Company, December 11th.</p>
<p>Notice of Lost Persons: If there are any lost men or women, please pay attention to the following information: Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>No. 1137: Ji Sunshi, female, from Gaoyou, age 20, sent by the Public Security Bureau to the China Relief Society for Women and Children on August 1, 1920.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Art College Achievement Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Pei Liang</p>
<p>For the past half year, I have practically become a country bumpkin, hiding at the bottom of a building in a small village in Jiangwan. I rarely go to Shanghai. It is now late autumn, and the grass is withering. Even nature itself is in seclusion. But I do not lack dreams. I dream of being able to immerse myself in an artistic environment and come into contact with beautiful things. So I cannot completely settle down. Sometimes, I wake up from my dreams. Recently, I have been preparing a small play with some friends, and I have run to Shanghai several times. On the 10th, I had just gotten off the train when I happened to meet Mr. Wang Daoyuan, who invited me to take a look at the Shanghai Art College that he founded. I was just looking for an opportunity to appreciate some artistic flavor, so I went with Mr. Wang into that newly built school building.</p>
<p>The school was busy setting up the exhibition that would open the next day. The place was full of paintings. Some had already been placed, while others were lying randomly against the walls and on the tables. I often have some prejudices. I believe that a completed work of art is certainly most worthy of our appreciation. But there is another kind of unrefined charm in the process of creating and completing a work of art, even if one is only an observer, that makes us linger and not want to leave. For example, I certainly enjoy watching a play from a seat in the audience, but I enjoy working backstage even more. The process of setting up this art exhibition gave me the same kind of interest that I feel backstage, even though I do not even know how to hammer a nail in the right place to hang a painting properly.</p>
<p>I am too much of an outsider when it comes to painting, so I cannot say much. Although I received Mr. Wang's cordial guidance, looking at some of the paintings that had already been hung still made me amazed by their richness, beauty, and endless variety. I have only seen a couple of hundred of the more than eight hundred pieces of student work. They are fresh and composed, truly the result of excellent instruction. During that one hour there, I deeply felt that I was immersed in an artistic atmosphere. Art students who have studied for two or three years have reached this level of accomplishment. One can imagine what kind of life they lead on a daily basis, what kind of education they receive, and how their spirits and emotions are expressed. I suddenly envied their student life, knowing that the realm unfolding before them is infinite. Looking back at the past, I cannot help but feel regret that the artistic education I oversee and the artistic cultivation I have been able to obtain are so weak. Painting has already made some progress in China. Now Mr. Wang has created a most perfect palace of art. What brilliant flowers of art will bloom from here? But the art we are working on is still groping in the dark. When will someone like Mr. Wang come out to open up the way for us?</p>
<p>As for the recent works of professors such as Wang, Chen, Guan, and Ni, which are placed in the exhibition as references, after seeing them, I can only admire and be intoxicated. How can I praise them?</p>
<p>Tomorrow, on Jiangwan Road, a newly built building, simple and unadorned in appearance, with extremely harmonious colors that reveal simplicity and dignity, will release the radiant light of art. Art lovers should spend three hours inside. After they come out, they will have beautiful dreams lingering in their minds.</p>
<p>(Note) The Shanghai Art College Achievement Exhibition opens today. The location is inside the college near Tiantong'an on Jiangwan Road. (Editor)</p>
<h3>Japanese Imperial Art Exhibition of Western Paintings Touring</h3>
<p>— Xie Haiyan</p>
<p>Japanese Correspondence</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>My classmate, Mr. Yuan Teng, invited me to go to the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum in Ueno Park to see the 10th Imperial Art Academy Exhibition. Seeing exhibitions is, of course, very much to my taste. However, I am ashamed to say that I have recently become so poor that I even have to save on postage stamps, which are indispensable. Going to the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum is not only a matter of not being able to afford the admission ticket, but also a problem of not having the train fare from Nishi-Ogikubo to Ueno Station. I had to politely decline him, saying that I was very busy at the moment and could not spare the time. I would have to go to see the exhibition when I had free time.</p>
<p>This morning, I did not expect Mr. Yuan Teng to come to my place again. His face was full of smiles, and he took out two admission tickets from his bag and placed them briskly on the table.</p>
<p>"Let's go. I've bought the admission tickets for you. Isn't today Sunday? Let's take advantage of this clear Sunday and spend the day at the venue," he said earnestly.</p>
<p>"Thank you. Haven't you already seen it?" I replied</p>
<p>"I want to see it again, but it's too boring to go alone.</p>
<p>"It would be best to take a book and read "Atelier" on the train, right?" he continued, taking out a copy of "Atelier" magazine from the bookshelf for me.</p>
<p>Like an elderly person, with teeth fallen, hair sparse, a hunched back, and a pigeon-shaped figure, the Ueno in early winter is no longer as lush and lovely as it was when I visited the Nikakai Exhibition two months ago. There are no red flowers, and there is no green grass. Only the sparse, withered, and yellowed dry leaves still flutter uncertainly on the bone-like branches. The fountain in the Eyeglass Pond gently seems to be sadly playing a lament for the loss of youth. The cherry trees in front of the Toshogu Shrine and the willows by the Shinobazu Pond have also lost their graceful original appearance. However, the number of carriages, horses, and tourists has not decreased as a result. Perhaps this is due to the magnetic attraction of the Imperial Exhibition. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Written to Bao Jun</h3>
<p>— Cheng Bingbing</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>"Bao Jun,</p>
<p>I am writing this letter to you because, besides you, I am so lonely that I have no one else to talk to. Even if this letter is not exactly written to you, I have to drag someone into it to make it the object of my writing, so I have to use your honorable name.</p>
<p>It's only been two or three weeks since I last saw you, but in these two or three weeks, I have been truly pitifully lonely and isolated. I haven't had the chance to say a single word for almost seven or eight days. Besides the landlord and the owner of the hotel, all they talk to me about is when I can pay the rent and the bill. I still feel that not talking to anyone is my happiness, because talking to the landlord and the owner of the hotel only increases my suffering.</p>
<p>Since separating from you, I haven't done anything. Although I once declared to you verbally, "I will try to create something," lately, due to my unsettled state of mind, I can't write a single word when I pick up a pen.</p>
<p>All day long, I wander on the streets, taking aimless walks with no benefit, to pass the long days. But in the end, I only earn a heart full of sorrow.</p>
<p>Bao Jun, you know about my recent experiences, which are almost the same as when I was praying three years ago. I only have one bamboo cloth (or you could say freedom cloth) long gown to wear. Besides this piece of clothing, I have no second piece of clothing to change into. But when I look at others on the street, they are all wearing beautiful suits, with beautiful lovers, sitting in cars, going in and out of cinemas, dance halls, and cafes. Alas, how happy they are! And me? And me? Alas, Bao Jun, what can I say to you?</p>
<p>Since returning to the South from Shandong in March this year, I have become unemployed. I haven't had a single day of peace and happiness. Therefore, these past six months have been extremely painful for me. Any event only causes me sorrow and makes me cry.</p>
<p>Alas, Bao Jun, I shouldn't be telling you these things. I have written too many words. For someone like me, being able to get through one day is a blessing. How dare I talk about peace and happiness?...</p>
<p>However, Bao Jun, I am still a person. I am still a young man. Since I exist in this world, I naturally have the right to demand all kinds of desires for life.</p>
<p>A week ago, I discovered a woman who, in my eyes, is the most beautiful woman. As for this woman, Bao Jun, I don't know what your comments would be after meeting her, because you have never met her at all. But for me, since meeting her, my heart has been restless.</p>
<p>Oh, Bao Jun, I can tell you, my psychology has indeed changed recently, unlike two or three years ago. Maybe it's because of my age, maybe it's because my body has recovered to health. I don't know why, but lately, I have deeply felt that without the comfort of the opposite sex, it is truly lonely.</p>
<p>Because of this reason, the impression of that woman in my heart is very strong. I think she is truly a beautiful fairy. But, Bao Jun, in the French Park, I smiled at her, and she gave me a flirtatious glance. But after leaving the French Park, she acted dignified again. When I approached her one step further, she would avoid me.</p>
<p>Alas, Bao Jun, how could I have the qualifications to be in love with her? How could I have the qualifications to be in love with her? I am simply dreaming. I am simply dreaming. Bao Jun, I can also tell you that her family is at No. 161 ×× Road. I don't know what her father does, but the family employs three or four male and female servants. Although they don't have a car, they have two chartered cars. Although this can't be said to be a capitalist's family, it can be considered a small, wealthy family. And me? And me? Oh, Bao Jun, you know, I am a poor scholar. I have nothing of value besides myself. I haven't paid the rent for the garret I live in for three full months. When I go to the street, I don't even have money to take the tram. Do I still have the qualifications to think about her? Alas, love and money are incompatible.</p>
<p>I have been seeking employment this year, but I can't find it. People don't want me to be a teacher, and because I am unknown, my articles are rejected by various bookstores. In this way, I can only sit and wait to starve to death. What else can I say, since I am not accustomed to making a living? But, Bao Jun, I never thought that in my current situation, I would have such inappropriate thoughts about women. I am truly seeking my own death. I am truly seeking my own death (To be continued)</p>

<h3>New Atmosphere of the Grassland Society</h3>
<p>— Nanxin</p>
<p>Grassland Weekly Greatly Refreshed, Three New Books Published Successively</p>
<p>"Grassland" is a powerful pure literary weekly in the country, and it can be regarded as unique among the most popular small publications in Shanghai. Almost no students do not like to read it, so its sales increase issue by issue. Since the publication of the reform issue of Volume 3, Number 1, it has strived for excellence and enrichment in content, and has further unified its writing to wash away the old appearance of desolation and lack of central thought in the past. This is generally recognized by those who love to read Grassland. Because it is so wonderful and powerful, it can be praised by the broad audience. Even the "Avant-Garde Weekly" and "Era Youth", which were popular for a time, are the same for several publications that emerged as a surprise after Grassland. Of course, today's new books and general periodicals really fill the publication world, but intellectuals with special interests in literature must go through careful and precise selection when purchasing certain new books or regular items. Therefore, some people say, "Buying books first requires looking at the content." This is certainly an experienced statement. I believe that the general readers' enthusiastic love for "Grassland" and "Avant-Garde Weekly" and other periodicals is undoubtedly for its rich content. It is worthwhile for us to narrate that we can read extremely powerful articles on a small publication.</p>
<p>However, most of the various publications issued by the domestic publishing industry do not have a central idea. Sometimes they melt various texts into one furnace, which is terribly messy. Regardless of whether it is sentimental, romantic, classical, or proletarian, as long as it is a so-called famous author's translation, it is pulled together to attract the attention of readers. Some are blindly shouting to cater to the psychology and taste of readers. This is certainly not the correct attitude of those who strive for culture. In the current era trend, for the objective need, it is necessary to determine a kind of literature with a central consciousness. The promotion of this literature is what "Avant-Garde Weekly" and "Grassland" are showing. Therefore, "Grassland Weekly" has had a consistent unity in writing since Volume 3, Number 1, and this kind of upward literature has given many powerful instructions to those who love literature. "Grassland" can be welcomed by the majority of readers. Of course, this is the biggest reason. From this, we can also understand that contemporary literature must have a correct central idea and a progressive and upward consciousness. Otherwise, this literature will only sink and even perish.</p>
<p>"Grassland Weekly" has at least achieved a correct central consciousness in this third volume, but the colleagues of the society also want to strive for excellence in the content. After the third volume is completed, they will start actively planning in order to become the only pure literary publication in the country. Therefore, it has not been published for a long time, which makes the general readers who love to read it really look forward to it. In the future, in the scope of literature, in addition to novels, poems, prose, dialogues, essays, papers, criticisms, literary news, and other categories, it will also focus on the real writing of school life, translating foreign masterpieces, and short scripts suitable for school performances. These, of course, can make the content of "Grassland" gradually develop and become the most perfect kind of pure literary publication. However, they will never cater to low-level tastes and change the theme determined in the third volume of "Grassland". At the same time, literary news is described with an objective style, and the latest news of the Chinese publishing industry is reported to readers in each issue. Of course, this new news is more agile than what is published in various monthly magazines, and the news of literary groups in various schools is also published as much as possible in order to become a must-read publication for students in the literary world.</p>
<p>In the future, "Grassland" will be decided to be published on schedule. In any case, it will not be allowed to be delayed or postponed. Every Saturday, each sales point will have it for sale. Society members and subscribers can read it earlier for pleasure. In addition to Zou Cai, Huang Huanruo, Wang Tiehua, and Yang Zengyang, who have been working for a long time, Shao Guanhua, Yang Yinshun, Dai Xingyao, Wang Fen, Wang Yixin, Ms. Luo Hong, Ms. Huo Zhenya, Du Liang, Liu Shengwu and other famous writers in the literary world are also responsible for writing articles. Therefore, in the content of each issue, there must be new and powerful texts contributed to the readers. For the contributions from the outside, as long as they are in line with the purpose of this magazine and have new expressions, we will try our best to accommodate them, and open a "Reader's Mailbox" column in order to accept readers' advice for improvement, so as to be refreshed issue by issue. Therefore, "Grassland" will definitely shine a bright light in the literary world in the future. This is within our expectations, but this power is still based on the shoulders of the majority of readers.</p>
<p>"Grassland" was arduously operated by Jin Kuansheng. In addition to publishing this weekly magazine, he also publishes series of books. Recently, he has successively published three kinds. One, Tang Zengyang's "Sister's Remains" is a collection of beautiful prose, and there are many beautiful illustrations, which really add a lot of color to the book. He is good at writing poetry, and writing prose with poetic methods and emotions is the most thought-provoking. Therefore, after the book was published, almost every society member and reader had a copy, which shows that his poetry is extremely popular with readers. The second is Jin Kuansheng's "Pre-Marriage Notes", which is a novella. The content is mostly the author's faithful narration. The printing and binding are extremely beautiful. The color illustrations inside can arouse the interest of readers. The third is Zou Fang's "Kiss", which is a lyrical long poem, crowned with prefaces by Professors Zhao Jingshen and Fu Donghua. There are also several illustrations. Really, in the silent Chinese poetry world, Zou Jun's "Kiss" is really worthy of our attention. At the same time, it is also a rare and delicate lyrical poem in the domestic poetry world. As for the detailed content, it will be recommended later. The Grassland Society has made such efforts and contributions to culture, which is worthy of our detailed narration. As for the spirit of Jin Kuansheng's arduous operation, it is even more unmatched by other publishing figures. Regarding this, I think society members and readers can understand.</p>
<p>"Grassland" is refreshed in each volume, so that each issue is more advanced than the previous one. Of course, it is because it has received the power of love from the majority of readers. From Volume 4, Number 1, there will be a new look. The vertical and horizontal version will be published this Saturday. I hope readers will wait and see.</p>
<p>In addition, in this volume, it is planned to publish several special issues. A, creation special issue, B, drama special issue, C, poetry special issue, D, essay special issue, E, sketch special issue. Probably a special issue will be issued every three issues in order to arouse the interest of readers. In short, the future "Grassland" has a new and vigorous atmosphere.</p>
<p>Volume 4, Number 1 will be published this Saturday. I hope friends who love "Grassland" will pay attention.</p>
<h3>Piano Instruction by Mr. Daibo</h3>
<p>— Ti</p>
<p>Among the various ways of human work, one ideal that is sometimes overlooked is the simplification that makes effort easier and shorter, so that the goal can be achieved by the most rapid progress of human power. Sometimes applying a person's strength in a more scientific way can achieve more quickly than by a greater effort in an indirect way.</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>The "Daibo Method" represents the most complete progress made in the development of piano practice. This is a plan developed by Luther Weg Daibo. Daibo was the conductor of the National Opera House in Berlin for many years. Daibo studied the skills of great pianists in order to see where the strengths of each family were, and what the most effective way to express the heart's impulses from the muscles was. This is something that people who are familiar with this matter know.</p>
<p>Daibo, because he saw that people's inability to master the technology of the piano was entirely due to the lack of muscle adaptability, so a part of his method was a movement of the fingers, hands, and arms, which his students had to practice in addition to practicing the piano. His method is superior to the method that requires several hours of continuous practice in that it focuses on several movements in a short period of time. The representative of this method is Hanon. He advises his students to practice as much as possible every day. Everyone now knows that this method is counterproductive. The results obtained are far less than what should be obtained after many terrible works.</p>
<p>But scholars who adopt the Daibo method, whether young or old, always find his homework interesting and often welcome new homework with a fresher mood.</p>
<p>This is the secret of the Daibo method.</p>
<p>Mr. Poche Surman is a Czech pianist who has traveled and performed in Germany, England, and Scotland. His father was the conductor of a music team in Czechoslovakia. Mr. Poche Surman became the organist of the Church of St. Ignazius in Prague at the age of seventeen. He has composed several pieces of music and has written scores for many Czech folk songs.</p>
<p>The musicians in this city expressed great attention and admiration for Ulman Xian's music, "Song of the Nile," a valuable piece of music.</p>
<p>When Mr. Ulman and the famous Russian violinist Surmus performed in England in August 1920, the "Manchester Guide" on August 14 stated that Mr. Ulman was born in Prague twenty-six years ago, where he studied music and won the first prize in music production. Mr. Ulman's position in his country is very high.</p>
<p>The "London Daily" on August 12 of the same year also said about this matter, "Mr. Ulman is a very outstanding Bohemian pianist."</p>
<p>After four years of work in Shanghai, Mr. Ulman is willing to briefly summarize his work achievements to inform the public. The piano instruction of the Daibo method he introduced has quickly gained recognition, and the number of students who have successfully completed this course is enough to prove the appreciation for this method. This is what he is very happy about. He has received praises and criticisms about this teaching method from all aspects, so the advantages over other methods can be described without redundancy.</p>
<p>However, there are still many people in Shanghai who have never heard of or know the actual effect of the Daibo method, so they have not paid attention to this matter, and they often regretfully recall the difficulties they felt when they learned music in the past, remembering those daily repetitive "nerve-stimulating" exercises, and sometimes, after several years of study, they gave up their music career due to frustration, but some did not take their own past as a lesson, and still made their children engage in music research in the same righteous way, thinking that the difficulties they had suffered in the past were necessary for the progress of success. However, since their time, the system of music teaching has been completely changed. With today's Daibo method, a person can easily read music without having to suffer the hard work spent when using the old method, thus making the time spent on research a pleasure and a pastime, rather than a distasteful obligation that must be completed in the shortest period of time.</p>
<p>The Daibo method represents the most complete method developed in piano instruction. This is not a theory or a set of commercial advertisements, but a scientific method of obtaining practical results with the least amount of effort. This effect cannot be obtained by the old-fashioned teaching method used before. Because parents know that they are trying their best to give their children the best education, Mr. Ulman sincerely asks parents who pay attention to this matter, and those who want to have their children receive music training, to come to his teaching center and talk to him in person, and at the same time, they can verify the results obtained by students under the Daibo method after four months, one year or two years. They can also personally ask the students how much time they spend practicing with this method. Their answers will show that the percentage of time spent on this method is surprisingly small.</p>
