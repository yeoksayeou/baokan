<p>國民社十五日柏林電選舉結果末次之計算與今早所發表之數目無大懸殊德國投票分配法極爲複雜故現時僅能知某一派得若干票數至其應得若干議席則尚待支配國民黨新組織之國家黨（前稱民主黨）及經濟黨三黨之票數均相等至三黨中何黨將佔若干席則莫從預定大約在十席與二十八席之間耳各黨之票數大概如次社會民主黨一四三票（以前爲一五二）計此次少去百分之七國家社會黨一○七票（前爲十二）計增出百分之七十共産黨七十六票（前爲五十四）計增出百分之四十中央教士黨六十八（前爲六十一）計增出百分之十二胡根堡國權黨四十一（前爲七十九）計少去百分之五按今日選舉之結果實出全德民衆意料之外國家社會黨人員初亦不料竟能有一百另七席之多同情於穩健議會主議之人員見全席數中一百八十三席被民權派所佔自難免懊喪幸羣信所餘之少數議員决能力守前外長史特萊斯曼博士之外交政策不致被捲入激烈之波澜中耳據一般老於觀察人員之所信此次投票人數之暴加非但與中間派無利恐反將助成國家社會黨之勢力耳於聯邦議會之成分未正式宣佈以前黨派之結合當然尚非其時而據各報紙之意見日後新議會欲與政府合作非實現號稱之大混合黨不可所謂大混合黨者即將社會民主黨中央敎士黨巴威國民黨國家黨及其他由中級黨派所組成各小團體融冶於一爐而成一政黨也此事若果能成就則德國政府地位當可日趨於穩固不致受左右兩極端派之所摇動云新議會照德憲法於選舉終結日之十日後開第一次會議</p>
<p>國民社十四日柏林電德國各地選舉時務所咸於晨間八時半開始投票至下午五時截止今日天氣絕佳前往投票者非常踴躍且僅除柏林曾於昨夜有小紛擾三數起致死二人傷數人外其餘各處皆秩序良好說者咸稱德國自建立共和以來歷届選舉期從未有若此日之安靖與有紀律者投票人起此時猶難確知但約略估計當占全體選民中百分之八十至八十五按上届選舉僅有百分之七十四當下午五時截止投票後立即開□□檢票至七時許柏林區先將一部份結果發表一時各報號外爭傳街衢中人爲之满至此次選舉趨勢大約至午十一時許當可有明晣之表示</p>
<p>國民社十五日柏林電國會改選結果迄今所知者左右兩極端派大獲勝利素以建立棒喝政府爲目的之國家社會黨受社會經濟衰落之賜票數大增在新國會中勢力之雄殆將僅次於社會民主黨社會民主黨素抱社會主義此次雖稍有損失諒仍可爲各黨冠上届國會中該黨占一百五十二席本届或可得一百四十席國家社會黨在上届國會僅有十二席此次已將近一百之數所得票數不啻十倍共産黨原有五十四席今亦受經濟界阢隉之賜已增至七十五席至現政府各黨内僅中央教士黨與巴威國民黨票數大有增加餘如國民黨及民主黨改組之國家黨俱喪失不少經濟黨亦僅勉維舊狀而已反對之國權派三黨原有七十九席此次所得竟不及半數可謂大失敗惟各黨議席確數因比例代表制計算較繁須至星期二午間方能確知第目前已可確定者則政府現行財政外交政策仍可在新國會内穩占多數而白魯寗内閣員亦幾全體當選云</p>
<p>路透電十五日柏林電據最近推測新國會之議席各黨所得之數約略如下社會民主黨一四三棒喝黨（即國家社會黨）一○七日耳曼國權黨四七中央黨六八共産黨七六國民黨二九國家黨二○經濟黨二九巴威國民黨一九農民黨一八商業黨六田主黨三餘二十一度屬於各派今日各報承認彼等對於棒喝黨之勝利不免有所顧瞻彼等以爲今遏制復古派之猛襲其唯一可能方法乃在中等階級各黨與社會黨相組合則何以三二一人之大多數抵抗棒喝黨共産黨日耳曼國權黨集成之二二四人政界已切實聲明此種組合將担保遵守白魯寗政府之對外政策國家社會黨黨員已宣布如以國防至内務二任予該黨則該黨願協同組織政府國家社會黨並要求解散普魯士國會務行選舉於是應以普魯士内長及柏林警務總監二任予該黨此種條件衆視爲不可接受蓋一經接受則陸軍與警察之統率權將均爲棒喝所有而不難逹其推翻共和建設狄克推多制之目的矣</p>

<p>路透社十五日柏林電兩個極端派即國家社會黨（棒喝黨）與共産黨在此届大選舉中大獲勝利投票人數佔有選舉權者百分之八十五平均計之國會一席投票六萬目前各黨所得席數如下或許稍有變更社會民主黨一三八國家社會黨一○三中央黨七六共産黨七五日耳曼國權黨四○其他各黨九一此項結果使德國政治生活大爲擾亂國家社會黨之大勝利已引起空前之局面計新國會議員代表國家社會黨日耳曼國權黨及共産黨者數逾二百與之對抗者將爲中堅派欲德國不採行極端政策則中堅派唯有組織混合内閣以制之耳棒喝黨與共産黨皆輕視國會故新國會將有陷於絕境或暴烈行動之結果棒喝黨機關報甚少全國報紙幾一致痛斥棒喝黨但棒喝黨在反對聲中而竟獲有結果殊爲可異實則該黨在民衆之積極宣傳及其打倒一切共和制度之標語已感動勞動與中等階級矣棒喝黨並非主張帝制但主張如墨索里尼所創之狄克推多制耳</p>
<p>路透社十五日柏林電國家社會黨即棒喝黨出人意外之選舉成功已使全國人心大受剌激該黨自已初料可獲六十席今不獨如願以償且遠過之其故實如該黨政綱之受多數人歡迎也其政綱中有一設立仿棒喝式之狄克推多制二清除德國之外族勢力尤其是猶太民族三撲滅大田主制等條共産黨雖甚仇視棒喝黨但衆料如社會民主黨組織政府則共産黨將爲棒喝黨後援</p>

<p>（北平通訊）自暑假前清華大學發生風潮以來一年容易又秋風轉瞬四月暑假中雖然糾紛屢起目前如何甚爲社會所關心記者特赴清華調查眞象謹就所得縷述如左</p>
<p>校長問題仍懸置自羅家倫離開清華一切校務皆由教務長秘書長文學院長理學院長法學院長組成之校務會議商量辦理現在教育部對於羅家倫之辭職置之高閣對於善後辦法深感鞭長莫及至於北方自喬萬選上次接收清華未獲成功後雖改變方針亦無效果中間曾有顧孟餘繼任之傳說一般人士對之甚爲漠然蓋北方當局因軍事政治忙於應付對清華問題現尚談不到也</p>
<p>教務長行將選舉清華教務長原由政治系主任吳之椿充任自校長問題發生雖一切事務由校務會議取决但吳氏以地位關係所負責任較多因而覬覦清華之人謂吳氏把持校務圖謀校長吳氏聞悉之下甚爲消極乃向校務會議辭去教務長之職并聲明自八月一日起關於教務長之事體概不負責近以開學在即教務長職務亟應有人擔任乃校務會議電陳教育部請示辦法覆電謂可即由教授會選舉代理聞校務會議已發出公函定九月八日上午召集教授會議選舉代理教務長并討論校務十五日開學上課校務會議佈告九月八日至九日新生報到十日舉行新生甄别試騐十一日至十三日舊生繳費註册新舊生選課十五日上午行開學禮下午上課</p>
<p>學生會歡迎新生本年考取新生一年級新生二三年轉學生及研究生合計約二百五十人彼等涉水跋山不遠千里而來初到北平人地生疏清華慣例每年由學生會組織招待新生委員會辦理招待歡迎事宜本年清華消夏週刊特印歡迎新同學專號内容略分清華現狀校長問題各系情形及如何利用圖書舘體育館等等</p>
<p>建築發展之近况清華建案中之生物館天文臺圖書館與學生宿舍皆由天津基隆建築公司計畫承辦自去秋動工迄今一年依合同規定生物館與學生宿舍皆於現在開學前交工但事實上在一二星期不能告成勢須延遲二三星期至圖書館之建築則須於年底落成天文臺正開始建築中據說生理館需用經費十五萬元學生宿舍十二萬元圖書館二十六萬元天文臺四萬元開學後並擬著手建築女生宿舍至於圖書經費去年爲十四萬元本年度增至十七萬元</p>
<p>現在社會經濟破産北平國立各校求維持現狀已非易事而清華經費充足環境優美擴充發展正未有艾教授皆國内碩儒學費則年僅廿元有人目清華爲價廉物美誠有至理深願莘莘學子利用如此之優美環境君等之寳貴光隂潛心學術努力研究勿錯過艱辛得來之機會焉</p>

<p>— 容伯</p>
<p>余浸淫於唱片垂廿年矣朋友相晤輒以唱片之興致何若相詢或亦目余爲識途之老馬如有置機片之事必屬余爲之定取捨初亦感年來唱片事業之勃興出片之繁冗實令人有無所適從之苦唯余嗜痂有癖半生精力幾盡耗於此是故對於各唱片之良窳粗具相當之認識</p>
<p>唱片之用力灌音於事實上突現一種特殊之進步並賦予吾人極好之福音而余之對於唱片興趣益濃厚矣惟電力攝音之片歌樂萬一配置失當或技師技劣者其結果實使人難受然此病犯者尚鮮可云幸事不過唱片聲浪之高細一片兩歧者恒有不第一公司之片有低響之分所以唱針有高原低三種之别便利於置唱片者之擇用也</p>
<p>唱機之置備就余管見所及而論如有經濟上之可能自以購置最優等者爲佳是則發音之動聽可以忘憂且較原人所歌尤佳年來余經騐所得並與友朋之研求似以白郎司惠克Brunswick之唱頭發音最準確其次當推物克多Victor而機亦須購大者（或自製者唱頭須設法辦到則價可廉於舶來品不少）蓋大者發音門亦大發音門之大小最低限度以直徑八英寸能大尤佳而内部之音斗忌用金屬製否則失却歌者肉音之美妙唱機之價格自製一落地機不過二百餘元如購舶來品近因金價高貴即有蓋無脚之機亦須二百元左右矣</p>
<p>唱片之做劣最近出世之開明余認爲满意之唱片不但發音高朗有人病其太響如用細針開唱妙不可言而質地之優實勝人多多即戲劇之選擇亦極精警角色旣整齊且多對口唱念俱全之戲各片聲浪又多一致益足令人稱道焉</p>

<p>者爲數極少此並非該公會所屬商店使用人數之未定額實因代表加增則會費照敝會定章第四十八條亦須隨之增加各公會爲節費起見多未派足而商會法第十一條之所謂就其超過之人數每满十五人得增加代表一人法文係屬任意規定該公會放棄是項增派代表之權利敝會依法自不能强制令其派足於計算方法並無關係再就來函所列之算計式而論敝會以爲此層仍須研究商會法第十一條所謂超過十五人之定義依敝會解釋所謂最近一年間之平均使用數超過十五人者係指公會所屬商店使用人之總數超過十五人而言所謂就其超過之人數每满十五人者亦係公會所屬商店使用人總數除十五人之基本數外以後從第十六人起每满十五人增加一單位加一單位即加推代表一人故依來函所舉之例如某公會所屬商店使用人共二百十人除十五人爲基本數派代表一人外餘數計一百九十五人共得十三單位應增派代表十三人連前共十四人不問其同業商店爲七家或八家算法均係一律因依照修正商會法施行細則第八條公會會員之代表額應就公會所屬商店使用人綜合計算之是以公會爲主體無須以同業公會之家數爲計算標準也管窺之見是否有當尚希早裁此致遼寗總商會</p>

<p>出自同行一童之口</p>
<p>捕房以爲溺死無疑</p>
<p>其母痴心盼子生還</p>
<p>小船主行動大可疑</p>
<p>三日前本報載三俄童大無畏精神新聞一段内述年方八齡半之盧康斯基充任大副十二齡之格拉維斯基居船主之要職三童浩浩蕩蕩一路而去古人有乘長風破萬里浪之壯志而此小童竟能實踐其破風踏浪之生活稱之爲大無畏精神誠確切不移故此段新聞載出後頗引起讀者之注意此事發生於本月一日而翌日兩童即被水巡隊送之返家惟大副盧康斯基則杳無音訊成爲疑案其母加爾登夫人殊爲焦灼除托捕房及各報尋訪外並發電於外埠親友一體注意昨日記者忽得一消息略謂盧康斯基之失蹤牽涉同行之兩俄童而康則已經溺斃云云記者以此事内幕必有曲折且饒興味因走訪盧童之母加夫人於邁而西愛路寓次而得此事之梗概焉</p>
<p>溺斃黄浦中所謂大副盧康斯基者與其母住於法租界邁爾西愛路三一九號記者第一次登門往訪時在八時左右見樓頭窗隙間惟漏燈光而靜穆似無人居因彈指叩門忽見門楣上有小紙條一上書英文注意犬三字（Bewareofdogs）記者因生戒心然剥啄旣久寂無人音無論犬聲心中甚爲懊喪因改趨其後門乃於其後門上用白粉大書華文當心猛犬四大字記者更爲之悚然因恩其家旣蓄多犬且又標其兇猛則小主人之富有冒險性或非偶然歟欲叩門無應者祗得廢然返第二次以十時左右往至則樓頭燈影外射具見室中陳設幽美旣欵關而入晤女主人加夫人戚然有憂容然小犬兩隻跳躍於主人之前後狀甚和善可親記者因憶及門前之注意犬後户之注意猛犬兩標貼心中不覺啞然旣坐加夫人言其子溺斃之消息確有其事惟此事之究竟情形殊不明瞭同行者計共三人其子年八齡半其一九歲而最長者則爲九歲惟三人以九歲者身量最高次爲伊子而十歲者反甚矮小之至康之溺斃消息尚係昨日下午三時得到其地點則在黄浦</p>
<p>衣服無處尋其後又述及最長之一童平時常至伊處引盧康斯基外出遊玩往來甚密然有時則未免有惡謔之行動耳加夫人述至此語梗氣噎中心似極悲傷及至語及其子臨難時情形益覺悲酸中來其語曰伊曾詢及歸來之一童問以其子旣死則衣服鞋褲或可作爲證明之物究竟何在是童答稱康入水時鞋子仍穿足上至衣服則用作浮泡之用已經脫去云視加夫人之狀似尚不信伊子之慘遭滅頂有如是之速者記者以時晏略述數語即興辭出花白之兩小犬仍伴其可憐之女主人至門外送客</p>
<p>眞相亦離奇據捕房訊盧康斯基之已經溺斃似無疑義至其致死之由則據回來之兩童報告其情形爲此船在黄浦江中駛行至東溝附近三童離船游泳而大副盧康斯基不知如何而溺斃焉惟其中有否疑竇尚在偵查之中蓋同行中之一童據云平時行爲甚屬不佳嘗於遊戲之間忽發奇想某次以盧童藏匿一地然後至其母處告以失蹤盧母予此童以小銀元數枚始得送還儼然有雛型之綁票意味今此事有此惡消息誠屬不幸之至牽涉此童者出於吾人之噫測矣</p>

<p>— 陳德明</p>
<p>法國的沙龍展覽和英國的皇家展覽都是全世界所屬目的不過這些展覽究竟限於一國範圍狹小其集合現代各國藝術傑作於一塲蔚爲大觀而展覽之的那就要推舉行於意大利威尼斯的國際藝術了威尼斯國際藝術展覽是世界各國藝術的總展覽正如夏令配克運動會是世界各國運動的總比賽該項展覽每二年舉行一次會址在意大利的威尼斯城因爲意大利是世界藝術的淵藪而威尼斯又爲意大利的藝術中心加以其地山明水秀風景如畫舉行藝術展覽最爲適宜這個展覽會因爲每二年舉行一次而且會址在威尼斯地方所以定各爲威尼斯二年展（VeniceBiennialExhilition）每次展覽别說威尼斯傾城空巷前去參觀即意大利其他各處的人以及歐美各國愛好藝術的人也不遠千萬的前去參觀誠爲國際藝術上最盛的事舉本年夏間舉行第十七次展覽盛况不减往昔歐美各國以及東亞之日本均有作品陳列（我國獨無出品國人對之不知作如何感想）其出品多者如意法德英美荷比匈捷克等國均獨闢一塲陳列展覽兹將展覽盛况分别述要如下</p>
<p>意大利部</p>
<p>意大利是國際展覽的東道主所以現在先把展覽會中的意大利部來講意大利因爲是大會的東道主所以出品獨多琳瑯满目令人如入山隂道上目不暇接不過這數千件的作品却有一種統一的色彩就是復舊的色彩（我用復舊兩字而不用復古因爲他們並不是回到古典主義不過是放棄未來表現等主義罷了）現在我們分繪畫和雕刻兩部來講着</p>
<p>繪畫</p>
<p>這次展覽中的意大利繪畫可就題材分爲三類來講</p>
<p>（甲）歷史畫意大利歷史畫的復興是一種自然的結果因爲近年來墨索里尼和他的棒喝黨的活動是畫家極好的現成題材勢有所不能放棄之者所以現代的意大利歷史畫同通常畫過去已久的事蹟人物的歷史畫不同實際乃是意大利政治活動的冩實畫我們稱牠們爲歷史畫乃是爲後世着想的這些畫是充满現代意味的不如那畫古人古物的歷史畫不能引起現代人的興趣同時這些畫又非如蘇俄藝術之爲政治宣傳品乃是純粹的叙事畫還些歷史畫家中尤以卡本納底（ArnaldoCarpananettl）□底（PrimsConti）加賽拉（TononaspCascella）諸人爲最足稱述他們把棒喝黨的歷來活動和革命經過忠實地再現在畫面之上他們那些畫可以比之於十九世紀法國浪漫派大畫家德臘克洛亞（Delacroix）的大作馬賽歌激起觀衆異常的興奮</p>
<p>（乙）人物畫意大利是素以人物畫著各於世的這次國際展中有許多可以注意的作品這些作品所以引人注意一類是因爲畫中的人物之可注意如步西Bucci特瑪利DeMaria格賴底Galanti法蘭希Frescia蘭勃底尼Lambertini加賽拉等所作詩人鄧南遮和諾佛羅Novaro等名人肖像還有一類則以技術見稱如阿米薩尼GiussppeAmlsani薩利底Saliett蒙底Monti高騰徐Gaudenzi貢底步西諸人的冩實底人物畫和范尼Vonni范格納底Vagnetti步西諸人的詩意底人物畫都深得文藝復興時代藝術之神髓而法爾脫林納里Feltrinelli的以色彩爲本位的人物畫尤爲人所屬目</p>
<p>（丙）風景畫意大利的風景畫無論在主題上和作風上都是充满着本地風光的拔西Bacci克里奇亞尼Caligiani逹尼Dani格里尼Gueriui和蒙底描冩脫斯干Tuscan風景托西Tosi潑拉脫里Pratell阿拉帶Arata夫米Fuimi和潑拉逹Prada描冩郎勃地Lombardy風景費加利Figiari和皮亞西Biasi描冩海島風景受法國影響的風景畫家是沙白雷路Sobrero却薩Chessa和保羅西Paolucci諸人</p>
<p>雕刻</p>
<p>最近意大利的雕刻藝術從這次的國際發展中看出來是毅然决然回到古典主義的道路上去了安特利奥底Andereorti麥雷尼Maraini大會秘書長羅曼納里Romanelli和勃羅尼Baroni等老作家不必說即一般青年作家也都鑽研古代雕刻而爲他們創造的張本如麥新納FrancescoMessina提取滂貝古城Pompeii（十數世紀前爲火山爆裂所覆没近始經人發掘得古代藝術作品甚多）的雕刻的精華和提示而創作他們的分析底雕刻麥啓尼Marchini在羅馬帝國時代的雕刻中找到韻緖的秘密麥里尼Marini則從古代伊脫羅斯開Etruscan彫刻中獲得他的異常的冩實能力有一般彫刻家拿現代的體育家運動家做對象表現强健的體格正與古代希臘彫刻家以戰士競技者爲主題的用意一樣女彫刻家之中可述的是寳茜EglePozzi和蘭特妮珈MaryalLednicka都是藝術優美的青年女作家</p>
<p>此外還黑白畫（包括素描版畫本刻等）也是極可注意的代表作家是勃篤里尼Bartoli卡保納底Carbonati麥曹尼柴里尼Mazzonizarini地沙多里Disertori麥格纳佛加Magnavacca毛露納Mauroner和步西都是馳名國際的作家他們的趣味和作風都是現代的其中尤以勃篤里尼和步西爲最</p>
<p>意大利部中最可記的實在是畫家墨翟格里亞尼Modigliani的一室作品莫氏是近代畫壇上的一個天才而遭際至爲可憫彼此政黨關係不爲政府所容避居法國巴黎從事繪畫其畫因格調過高不爲時人所識無購之者一千九百二十年氏餓死於巴黎貧民窟中到最近幾年他的畫纔受人重視起來現在他已經在藝術史上佔了一個永久的地位這次國際發展把他一生所作的畫五十餘幅彚集一室作空前之展覽此室觀者獨多皆留連不忍遽去蓋一則欣賞莫氏的高超藝術一則感慨其身世之悲慘也</p>
<p>法國部</p>
<p>法國是現代藝術中心在國際藝展中當然占着首要地位法國的藝術家太多了而且太都是早爲人所熟知的所以這裏不預備詳述了不過我們可以總括說一聲這次展覽中的法國藝術顯出法蘭西民族性比較往昔都顯著畫家中最惹人注意的是童根（VanDongen）他是現代法國畫壇的驕子他拿着濃艶的色彩描繪巴黎内外的美婦艶姬富於媚惑力國際展覽會特爲獨闢一室陳列他的畫其吸引觀衆之力獨强</p>
<p>德國部</p>
<p>這次國際藝展中所陳列的德國畫也可以用一句話來總括說着就是它們所顯出的德意志民族性也比往昔顯著德意志藝術本是富於民族性的歐戰告终後之數年中德國藝術界曾與歐洲其他各國藝術界作一度之聯手可是現在又分道揚鑣走他們自已的路了國際展中勃克孟（MaxBeckmann）的綜合底繪畫狄克思（OttoDix）的積體底人物畫巴拉克（Barlack）的强烈而富於表現力的雕刻都表顯着德意志强悍的民族性與法國部中童根的艶麗的繪畫和提包Despian）的柔美的彫刻遥遥相對適成反比例</p>
<p>英國部</p>
<p>素以保守著名的英國在這傾向復舊的國際藝展中却獨爲新藝術張目如繪畫方面的保羅納許（PaulNash）是這次國際展中碩果僅存的未來主義代表在上届的國際展中未來派作品是充室各室的又如薛格脫（RichardSickert）是印象派畫家飛爾樸（GlynPhilpot）的裝飾畫富於現代的神秘意味在彫刻一方面穆亞（Moore）的作品是介乎黑人藝術與立體主義之間的史啓賓（ohnSkeaping）的雕刻含是原始性的此外約翰</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>納許如保羅納許兄弟兩人的水彩畫道特（Dodd）約針彫薛格脫及勒許白雷（Rusbbwry約版畫是冠絕全塲的</p>
<p>美國部</p>
<p>美國在國際藝展中獨設一部是以本届開始的這也是可述的一件事有了獨立的一部人們部對於美國的藝術有了整個的認識以前人們因爲對於美國藝術没有深切的認識贸然以爲美國是無藝術之邦可是從這次國際藝展中看來美國倒着實是個後起之秀前途很是遠大光明呢這次展覽中繪畫方面足稱的是勃勒許（GeorzeBrush）白羅克（AlexanderBrook）狄金生（JSidneyDickinson）法欽（NicholaiTechin）和霍潑金斯（CharlesHopkins）的肖像畫而喬求白露（GeorgeBellows）蒲（CeciliaBeaux）法郎克斯（MauriceFromkes）和安徒生（KarlAnderson）的人物畫尤卓然有大家風範新派作家有華克（HoratisWalker和克資（Katz）彫刻方面足稱的是霍夫孟（MalvinaHoffmann）和伊華（MccartanEward）兩家</p>
<p>以上所述的幾國是在國際藝展中最居重要地位最受人注意的至於其他各國或獨關小部或併合展覽比較屬於次要故不俱述</p>
<p>綜之國際藝術展覽是世界各民族藝術活動的總表現我們在此次國際展中看出關於最近世界藝術趨勢的要點就是—</p>
<p>注重民族的表現</p>
<h3 id="c171">近代美術史潮論 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 易康</p>
<p>以民族底色彩爲主的美術史</p>
<p>自從法蘭西大革命直到近百餘年間的歐洲美術思潮的開展是美術史上極繁雜而迅速的變遷的一頁在這時代中因爲政治思想的解放和政治的昌明幾乎歐洲全土地的人們都從舊日的桎梏裏跑出來參與美術上的創造所以濃重的各民族底地域上特别的色度和暴風雨時代底精神都在全歐洲的美術上呈現着因此我們要澈討近代的美術不得不推溯到這偉大的時期而尤其重要的是不要忽略了作爲這時期美術主潮的是民族底色彩</p>
<p>在世界上的美術思潮史文獻中而能以民族底色彩作中心講述日本板垣鷹穗教授底近代美術史潮論是值得指屈的他是抛棄了歷來治美術史者散漫的無中心思想叙述的窠臼而作根據一種根本概念和原理底一種大胆的嘗試所以在他以民族底色彩來講述近代美術思潮史算是一種獨特的成功因爲美術也和文學一樣的異國情調不能調和或壓抑地方的色彩所以北歐的瑞典挪威等美術的描冩是刻畫冰天雪地以及半年白畫的一切法德和意大利的美術帶着南歐濃艶的色彩斯拉夫帶着廣漠的大陸底沉鬱和剛毅的色彩印每安人和黑人底美術帶着濃重的民族底色彩所以在他這書中便是以民族底色彩底天秤來估量這時代的各民族的美術思潮這樣在他的尺度中我們才可以看出那在當代産生那種美術底特質和意義</p>
<p>在美術史上近來流行的藝術意欲（Kurstwollen）是并無怎樣一致和統一的概念來指示内容因此也有把這句話認爲是指示據文化史而劃分的一時代的創造形式的人也有用爲一民族所固有的表現樣式的意義的學者但是評衡藝術的尺度是不能一成不變的也猶如在物理學上把相對論代替絕對論一樣美術上的考察也是在一成不變的尺度評衡起了懷疑所以在使用藝術意欲和推崇的人們在懷疑中抛棄了牠的永久價值另外尋求相對底尺度要將各時代各民族的藝術用那時代和那民族底尺度來估定牠的價值這新的方法惹起了人們的注意而美術史家的眼界更廣大理解力也分明進步了這樣美術家不致偏頗於一方面即是早期的異族的却在這種方法重新的興起了一個美術史家應是公平的觀察者同時也應該竭力是温暖的同情者而且更應該竭力是銳利的洞察去的一類口頭禪又漸漸的在新方法中興起了</p>
<p>所以在近代美術思潮中居於指導那從奴役中解放出的美術底創造的指導者便是時代思想這思想便成爲每個作家底信念支配了創造之業使每個作家都在時代手輪軌下轉側非在時代的陶冶中是没有藝術的價值這價值的形成又擺不脫時代給予他的民族底色彩的感應</p>
<p>因此那堅持着造形底地位而堅守着地盤的法蘭西的國民支配了自十八世紀以來的歐洲美術界而成爲美術史潮的基調者繼續的掌握了長久的統治權而與法國成對立的便是北歐民族中的德意志法蘭西常是造形方面的眞實的現實主義者專在實地上用功夫而北歐的民族雖然性格强率然而終於是偏重於理想忠實於自已底信念底理想主義者所以他們不用模特兒思索於非人間世的神秘因此他們是始終與南歐的畫派成了個决定不同的方向</p>
<p>計全書是以民族底色彩作爲經時代思想作爲緯在九章書中娓娓的講法國大革命以後底美術思潮史是在著作界使用民族底色彩爲中心而研究美術思潮的第一人日文係由東京大鎧閣出版在中國的北新書局有未轉變方向前的魯迅的譯本讀書不妨去讀一讀這部用新方法整理美術思潮史的鉅著</p>

<h3 id="c173">訪問蕭伯納（三） <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 霖</p>
<p>會見愛薩都拉鄧坎</p>
<p>我與愛薩都拉一次相會□我從没有見過她跳無□是一件珍奇的事蕭伯納說一那個時候我做了一件不常做的事我跑進社會我參與貴婦司高脫的茶會</p>
<p>我記得我坐在沙發上突然間一過素不相識的婦人坐下來在我的身旁發問過</p>
<p>你是蕭麽是的我回答說</p>
<p>她伸出兩隻臂膊這個婦人道到我這里來我終身愛你呀</p>
<p>蕭伯納重述這個故事的時候他發笑好像這件事的回憶使他十分快活</p>
<p>我問那没你怎様辦呢</p>
<p>我演了特立斯特藍和易蘇爾特的第二幕蕭伯納說大約有一小時的時間愛薩都拉與我繼續談着我記不清兩人互相所談的話不過我曉得旁聽的人注意我們每一句的談話是很喜樂的我想起初我的女主人必定有些興奮我要怎樣的去應付這個局面</p>
<p>我說我很能想像那種情景愛薩都拉常常對我說伊應該和你或者奥古斯都約翻結婚你對於她所得印象怎樣</p>
<p>哦蕭伯納幽靜地說所奇怪的就是我一些也記不出好與好所攝的照片有相像的地方她的照片是珍奇的因爲每張照片看起來都有伊特殊的風姿在我呢伊似乎很胖哦還有她很像一塊被撃過的糖果</p>
<p>我對蕭伯納說可憐的愛薩都拉給他形容盡緻了當他與她相會的時候伊對於自身的體貌已不經心更自悲劇發生之後伊姿態上受着不少的反應</p>
<p>她有魔鬼的面頰蕭伯納說她暢所欲言的講話然而伊的本領還不止此終使别人不至於稱伊爲惡魔</p>
<p>這時候蕭伯納正對吾面而坐態度非常的好我認爲這是一個機會解决這位戲劇家與愛薩都拉間一段炙噲人口的逸事</p>
<p>根據這段逸事愛薩都拉有一個時期伊的風姿被彫刻家和藝術家認爲世界上最美麗的伊冩信給蕭伯納問他倘然願意和伊合生一個小孩子她似乎說過她似乎說過你有世界上最聰明的頭腦我有最美麗的軀體那末讓我們來産生一個十全的小孩子罷對於這個請求蕭伯納回答說可是如果這個孩子生出來的時候具有我的軀體和你的頭腦那没怎樣辦呢</p>
<p>這段事使得蕭伯納發笑凡是完美的著作家對於他們自已的妙語總是好笑的</p>
<p>其實蕭伯納說這個並不是愛薩都拉向我提議的關於我這段事情的傳說有許多著名婦人詑涉在内尤其是愛薩都拉鄧坎實則我從一個外國女伶手裏接到這個奇異的貢獻她的姓名你所不知的而我又忘了但是我確然有那個回答</p>
<p>毫不自負</p>
<p>一個人可以拿對普通一班人不能講的話對蕭伯納講理由是因爲這個著名的戲劇家可以自負的地方甚多而他毫不自負所以其次我問伊一個問題這個問題在與他同等地位的著作家裏很少數人願意答復我猜想與我同等地位的青年人裏也是很少數人願意問他但是這是我的信仰就是一個人愈有智力他對於一個小小的坦白詢問愈少怨憤在這個特殊情形之下我感謝地說我的信仰完全的證明了</p>

<h3 id="e6">New Situation in the German Election <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Although the results of the German election have not been announced, a peculiar situation has emerged. According to the latest news, both the extreme left and right-wing parties have achieved significant victories. The number of seats obtained by these two parties is roughly equal to the combined strength of the Social Democratic Party and the Center Party. Some observers believe that this situation is sufficient to cause significant turmoil in German political life and lead to an unprecedented situation. This is likely not without reason.</p>
<p>German political parties often unite small parties with a larger party as their leader. The previous Mueller cabinet was based on the Social Democratic Party, while the current Bruning cabinet is based on the Center Party. This can be considered a one-party system, as there are no other major parties in the parliament with a balancing force to counter it. Therefore, the Center Party in the Bruning cabinet can use its left-right approach to coordinate activities in the middle, allowing the political situation to remain stable. However, in this election, although the Social Democratic Party has the most seats, the extreme left and right-wing parties have also greatly increased their strength and are tending to unite the German National People's Party to resist the Center Party. The Center Party's left-right approach will have no place to work. Unless it vigorously unites the Social Democratic Party and other middle parties to make them its allies, there is no chance of winning. This is obvious. Since recent years, the trend of Italian Fascism has permeated European countries, and the Communist Party, which opposes this ideology, has also grown secretly. Germany is taking both in, worrying about the uncontrollable Fascism and fearing the vigorous advancement of Communist forces. The so-called steady parties are trying hard to support themselves in the middle, wanting to find a way to curb their progress, restore balance in everything without competition, and ensure that the current cabinet's financial, diplomatic, and all policies proceed without change. Isn't this extremely difficult? The future changes in the German political situation are indeed difficult to predict.</p>

More than 10,000 agricultural bandits from the Red Army's 20th Army, Independent Regiment, and the 12th and 22nd Regiments, as well as from Anfu and Yongxin counties, launched a major offensive on Zhijun Mountain. Deng's division and the Luoshan police team used mountain artillery and machine guns to fiercely attack and killed the fake regimental commander Li Xueqian. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e33">Results of German Election <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<h3 id="e34">Social Democratic Party Receives the Most Votes; National Socialist Party Sees Unexpected Success <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 15th – The final vote count does not differ significantly from the figures released this morning. Germany's voting distribution method is extremely complex, so currently, it is only possible to know how many votes each party received. The number of seats they should receive is still to be determined. The vote counts of the new National Party (formerly the Democratic Party) and the Economic Party, both newly organized by the Nationalist Party, are roughly equal. It is impossible to predict which of the three parties will occupy how many seats, but it is estimated to be between ten and twenty-eight seats. The approximate vote counts for each party are as follows: Social Democratic Party 143 votes (previously 152), a decrease of 7%; National Socialist Party 107 votes (previously 12), an increase of 70%; Communist Party 76 votes (previously 54), an increase of 40%; Catholic Center Party 68 votes (previously 61), an increase of 12%; Hugenberg's German National People's Party 41 votes (previously 79), a decrease of 5%.</p>
<p>The outcome of today's election was truly unexpected by the entire German population. Even members of the National Socialist Party did not expect to win as many as 107 seats. Those who sympathize with a stable parliamentary system cannot help but feel disappointed that 183 seats in the total count are occupied by populist factions. Fortunately, it is believed that the remaining minority of members will be able to uphold the diplomatic policies of former Foreign Minister Dr. Stresemann and will not be drawn into violent waves. According to seasoned observers, the surge in voter turnout not only did not benefit the moderate parties but may have even strengthened the National Socialist Party.</p>
<p>Before the composition of the Federal Parliament is officially announced, party alliances are certainly not yet timely. However, according to various newspapers, if the new parliament wishes to cooperate with the government, it must realize the so-called "Grand Coalition." The so-called "Grand Coalition" would be the merging of the Social Democratic Party, the Catholic Center Party, the Bavarian People's Party, the National Party, and other small groups composed of middle-class parties into one political party. If this can be achieved, the German government's position will become more stable and will not be swayed by the extreme left and right wings. According to the German constitution, the new parliament will hold its first meeting ten days after the end of the election.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 14th – Polling stations across Germany began voting at 8:30 AM and closed at 5:00 PM. The weather was excellent today, and voter turnout was very high. Except for a few minor disturbances in Berlin last night that resulted in two deaths and several injuries, order was well-maintained elsewhere. It is generally said that no election period in Germany since the establishment of the republic has been as peaceful and disciplined as today. The exact voter turnout is still difficult to determine, but it is roughly estimated to be between 80% and 85% of all eligible voters. In the previous election, it was only 74%. After voting closed at 5:00 PM, ballot counting began immediately. Around 7:00 PM, the Berlin district released a portion of the results, and extra editions of newspapers were quickly distributed, filling the streets. The trend of this election is expected to become clear around 11:00 AM tomorrow.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 15th – As far as is known so far, the results of the parliamentary re-election show that the extreme left and right wings have won a major victory. The National Socialist Party, which aims to establish a "strong government," has greatly increased its votes due to the social and economic decline. Its influence in the new parliament will be second only to the Social Democratic Party. The Social Democratic Party, which has always advocated socialism, has suffered some losses but is still expected to lead all parties. In the previous parliament, the party occupied 152 seats; in this session, it may obtain 140 seats. The National Socialist Party had only 12 seats in the previous parliament; this time, it has nearly 100. The number of votes obtained has increased tenfold. The Communist Party, which had 54 seats, has also increased to 75 seats due to the economic turmoil. Among the parties in the current government, only the Catholic Center Party and the Bavarian People's Party have significantly increased their votes. Others, such as the Nationalist Party and the National Party, which were reorganized from the Democratic Party, have lost many votes. The anti-government National Rights Party had 79 seats, but this time it won less than half, which can be described as a major failure. However, the exact number of seats for each party is more complicated to calculate due to the proportional representation system and will not be known until noon on Tuesday. However, it can be confirmed that the current government's financial and diplomatic policies will still have a majority in the new parliament, and almost all members of the Brüning cabinet have been elected.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 15th – According to the latest estimates, the number of seats obtained by each party in the new parliament is roughly as follows: Social Democratic Party 143, Strong Government Party (i.e., National Socialist Party) 107, German National People's Party 47, Center Party 68, Communist Party 76, Nationalist Party 29, National Party 20, Economic Party 29, Bavarian People's Party 19, Farmers' Party 18, Commercial Party 6, Landowners' Party 3, and over twenty belonging to various factions. Today, various newspapers acknowledge that they cannot help but be concerned about the victory of the Strong Government Party. They believe that the only possible way to curb the fierce attacks of the restorationists is to combine the middle-class parties with the Socialist Party. Thus, the majority of 321 can resist the 224 members of the Strong Government Party, the Communist Party, and the German National People's Party. Political circles have clearly stated that this kind of combination will guarantee adherence to the foreign policy of the Brüning government. Members of the National Socialist Party have announced that if the party is given the portfolios of National Defense and Interior Affairs, it is willing to cooperate in forming a government. The National Socialist Party also demands the dissolution of the Prussian parliament and the holding of elections. It is necessary to give the party the positions of Prussian Interior Minister and Berlin Police Chief. These conditions are viewed as unacceptable because once accepted, the command of the army and police would both be in the hands of the Strong Government Party, making it easy to achieve its goal of overthrowing the republic and establishing a dictatorship.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 14th – On the eve of the end of the election campaign, disturbances occurred in Berlin and the provinces. The most serious incident occurred last night in Berlin when members of the Communist Party gathered at their headquarters on Brüderstrasse. A number of cars belonging to the National Socialist Party passed in front of the headquarters, and the Communist Party opened fire on them, killing one member of the National Socialist Party and injuring several others. The police had great difficulty maintaining order on the street. In other parts of Berlin, more than a dozen members of the National Socialist Party were injured by thrown acid bottles. A total of 200 people were arrested in Berlin. Similar clashes also occurred in the provinces. Five people were injured in Münster, six in Hanau, and seven in Allersberg. Furthermore, President Hindenburg was one of the first voters. Representatives of the League of Nations in Geneva also returned to the country to vote. Special polling places were set up in various hospitals so that doctors, nurses, and others could vote nearby. There were minor clashes in Berlin today, resulting in two deaths and some injuries, but the police were able to cope. A total of 400 people were arrested in Berlin last night and today, but most have already been released. The results of the election will not be clear until midnight. Also, the initial reports of the election results have given the impression that the National Socialist Party (i.e., the extreme right wing under the guidance of Hitler) is in the ascendant. The number of supporters of this party has greatly increased in some constituencies, but the Social Democratic Party has suffered a slight loss. The Communist Party has been able to maintain its position, and the Center Party has made some gains.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 15th – The two extreme parties, the National Socialist Party (Strong Government Party) and the Communist Party, have won a major victory in this general election. Voter turnout accounted for 85% of those eligible to vote. On average, each parliamentary seat requires 60,000 votes. The number of seats obtained by each party is as follows, and may be subject to slight changes: Social Democratic Party 138, National Socialist Party 103, Center Party 76, Communist Party 75, German National People's Party 40, and other parties 91. These results have greatly disrupted German political life. The great victory of the National Socialist Party has caused an unprecedented situation. It is estimated that the new parliament members representing the National Socialist Party, the German National People's Party, and the Communist Party number over 200. Those who oppose them will be the centrists who wish to prevent Germany from adopting extreme policies, but the centrists can only organize a mixed cabinet to control them. The Strong Government Party and the Communist Party both despise the parliament, so the new parliament will face a dead end or violent action. The organ of the Strong Government Party has very few newspapers. Almost all national newspapers have condemned the Strong Government Party, but it is remarkable that the Strong Government Party has achieved results in the face of opposition. In fact, the party's active propaganda among the public and its slogans of overthrowing all republican systems have touched the labor and middle classes. The Strong Government Party does not advocate an imperial system but a dictatorship like the one created by Mussolini.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 15th – The unexpected electoral success of the National Socialist Party, i.e., the Strong Government Party, has greatly stimulated the national sentiment. The party itself initially expected to win 60 seats, but not only has it achieved its wish, but it has far exceeded it. The reason is that the party's platform is welcomed by the majority. Among the provisions of its platform are: 1. Establishing a Strong Government-style dictatorship; 2. Eliminating foreign forces in Germany, especially the Jewish people; 3. Suppressing the system of large landowners. Although the Communist Party is very hostile to the Strong Government Party, it is expected that if the Social Democratic Party forms a government, the Communist Party will be a supporter of the Strong Government Party.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Warsaw, 14th – Polish Prime Minister Piłsudski published a statement in today's newspaper regarding the large-scale arrest of opposition party members.

The current implementation of his original plan is only a quarter of what he intended. He is a firm believer in the parliamentary system, but he believes that strict measures must be taken to eliminate corrupt elements before it can work. Finally, he guaranteed to abide by the constitution.</p>

<p>Head-on Conflict Between the Japanese Privy Council and the Government</p>
<h3 id="e37">Hamaguchi Refuses to Present Written Response <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 15th – The eleventh Privy Council Investigative Committee meeting, which was a mixture of optimism and pessimism, was held at the Privy Council Secretariat at 1:00 PM today with strict security. There were various questions and answers. Chairman Ito requested that the government clarify the written response regarding the treaty. Prime Minister Hamaguchi immediately refused, adhering to the established policy. The Privy Council's dispute with the government has now surfaced, causing a head-on collision. The Privy Council side has decided not to allow government officials to attend the next Investigative Committee meeting, but only the Privy Council committee members will meet. The government side has decided to adhere to its established policy and carry out its original intention.</p>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 15th – At the eleventh Privy Council Investigative Committee meeting, the Privy Council's request for a written response was rejected by the government. A head-on conflict has broken out between the Privy Council and the government.</p>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 15th – Regarding the view that the Privy Council Committee's deliberations should be suspended, the Privy Council side still holds a strong attitude, saying that since the government has not presented a supplementary plan and a concrete plan to reduce the burden, the review must be suspended until this outline is determined. The government's explanation that the Privy Council has no power other than to offer suggestions for or against is really childish. The interpretation of "offer suggestions for or against" is a familiar phrase in Chinese characters, and it not only means the intention to approve or deny. However, the government's attitude is also extremely strong, and it is determined to proceed according to the established policy. If the Privy Council suspends the deliberations, it will hinder the approval of the treaty, and it is determined to repel it head-on. Today's eleventh committee meeting is the day of the decisive battle between the Privy Council and the government, and its trend is extremely important.</p>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 15th – Privy Councilor General Masatarō Fukuda visited Chairman Ito at his private residence in Nagatachō at 9:00 AM today for over an hour. It seems that he advised him to coordinate in a harmonious manner. After the meeting, General Fukuda told reporters from the Electric News Agency, "I have not received any commission from either party. However, I am afraid that the censure of senior officials will cause worry to the Emperor, so I have made some efforts to do so. I cannot predict what will happen after this."</p>

<h3 id="e38">Holds Demonstration Rally <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Amsterdam, 14th – Despite the rain, the Dutch Socialist Party held demonstration rallies in Amsterdam and Rotterdam today. Representatives from all over the country participated to oppose the government's ten-year naval program, which would cost £10 million. The demonstrators also advocated for national endowment funds, an eight-hour workday, paid holidays, and insurance.</p>
<p>British Trade Minister</p>
<h3 id="e39">Expresses Views on Tariffs <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th – British Trade Minister Graham spoke yesterday at the League of Nations in Geneva, referring to the tariff conference that has already been held this year. He said that the convention proposed by the tariff conference stipulates that signatories must not increase tax rates before April 1931. The British government has decided to approve it and hopes that other countries will also approve it before November, so that negotiations on tax reduction between countries can begin at that time. Eighteen countries signed the agreement, and twenty-three countries signed the draft agreement to continue negotiations. The League of Nations Council should now pay attention to the necessity of lifting economic armament and stopping the tariff war and seek international opinions in economic relations. A conference was convened in 1927 not for free trade but for greater freedom of trade. Unfortunately, this lesson has been forgotten. Politicians obey the demands of industry and commerce and implement protectionist policies. Although a tariff truce conference has been held this year, the results obtained are not as expected by those who enthusiastically advocate the conference. However, the convention stipulating that taxes cannot be increased before April of next year does have its value. The purpose of the negotiations planned to begin this fall is to reduce tax rates across the board, which is even more important than previous conferences. It is hoped that results can be obtained early next year. This is part of the major problem of world recovery. He does not believe that restrictive tax rates can help the world's recovery because restrictive tax rates can give a certain industry temporary excitement, but they will ultimately hinder the world's recovery.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Special Parliamentary Session <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, Constantinople, 14th – The Turkish government has decided to convene a special parliamentary session on September 22 to discuss measures to fix the national currency and improve the banknote system. This session is not only related to major financial plans but is also the first time that an opposition party will be present in parliament, and the party is believed to have a secret understanding with President Kemal Pasha. Therefore, it also has great significance in political terms.</p>
<p>International Statistical Conference</p>
<h3 id="e41">Held at the House of Representatives Yesterday <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 15th – The International Statistical Conference, which is being held in Japan for the first time, has convened seventy-five representatives from twenty-five countries to meet at the House of Representatives from the 15th to the 22nd. The opening ceremony today was attended by Prince Chichibu, the honorary chairman, ambassadors from various countries, and cabinet ministers, making it a very grand occasion. The representatives of the countries were received by Duchess Ittō and other prominent ladies.</p>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 15th – The International Statistical Conference held a grand opening ceremony at the House of Representatives at 10:00 AM today, with Prince Chichibu as honorary chairman. After the ceremony, only the association members remained to discuss dividing the conference into three departments: population, society, and economy. The department heads were then elected. In the afternoon, the representatives of the countries met with Prince Chichibu at the Kasumigaseki Detached Palace, and in the evening, they attended a banquet hosted by Prime Minister Hamaguchi.</p>
<p>Japanese Seiyūkai</p>
<h3 id="e42">Brewing a Movement to Overthrow the Cabinet <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 15th – The Seiyūkai has been observing the actions of the Minseitō cabinet for the past fifteen months and knows that it has made many mistakes in domestic affairs, diplomacy, and secret administration. It has no effective countermeasures for the economic downturn and unemployment. It has been decided that the Seiyūkai's extraordinary assembly, which will convene on the 16th, will decisively raise the banner of overthrowing the cabinet. Based on the results of the economic survey team's report, it will present a new economic national policy to the public that includes measures to address the economic downturn, unemployment, and reduce the national burden. On the 28th, it will hold the first local advocacy meeting in Nagoya, which will continue throughout the country to carry out the movement to overthrow the cabinet. The Seiyūkai has added three policies to its previous seven major policies: opening up the economy, relieving unemployment, and reducing the national burden. As an emergency temporary measure, this is a clear contrast to the Minseitō's policy of focusing on austerity. When the Minseitō cabinet collapses in the future, there will inevitably be fundamental changes in various policies, so it is extremely noteworthy in all aspects.</p>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 15th – The Seiyūkai will hold an extraordinary assembly on the 16th. Today at 1:00 PM, the general meeting of the Policy Research Council was still held to prepare for the reading of the main points of the three economic policies that have been reviewed for several days: countermeasures against the economic downturn, countermeasures against unemployment, and tax reduction policies. After the Chief Yamamoto's explanation and two or three questions, it was unanimously approved.</p>

<p>Reuters, Geneva, 15th – The British delegation here strongly denies the American report that the British government intends to revise the war debt treaty with the United States.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 14th – Senior British Treasury officials Fisher and Jones have been secretly consulting with State Department officials for several days. According to political circles, the British government will launch a major movement to reduce war debts. British Prime Minister MacDonald wants to achieve what the previous British government failed to achieve, namely, to reduce Britain's debt to the United States in order to increase his political prestige at home. It is rumored that Fisher and Jones have been in New York for several weeks, staying at the home of former U.S. Ambassador to Britain Houghton, and secretly discussing the reduction of debts with major bankers. Furthermore, a responsible source in London claims that Fisher's trip to the United States is purely private.</p>

In particular, he could not remain silent on the suggestion that the Indian government could accept the proposal to cancel a portion of the public debt. This was certainly a misunderstanding by the mediators. The Viceroy's letter expressed gratitude for the efforts of the two mediators.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 14th – The Graf Zeppelin suddenly arrived here today and landed. Because there was no news beforehand, this action surprised the representatives of the League of Nations. Upon hearing the news, they rushed to the airfield to welcome it. Swiss Prime Minister Motta and German Foreign Minister Curtius also went. Also, when the League of Nations Council met today, the representative of Colombia asked the League to participate in the centenary of Bolivar's birth, because Bolivar was the advocate of world unity. The emergence of today's League of Nations has realized part of this doctrine. German representative Count Bernstorff strongly supported his proposal.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e49">Memorial Week for the Central Government and the National Government <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 15th, the Central Party Headquarters held its 77th weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen in the Great Auditorium. Central Committee members Chen Guofu, Liu Luyin, Fang Juehui, Chen Lifu, and staff from various departments and guests, totaling about 500 people, attended. After Chairman Chen Guofu led the ceremony, Fang Juehui reported on his experiences attending the 14th International Labour Conference. He stated that he was appointed to attend the conference in Geneva, departing from Nanjing on April 28th and setting sail from Shanghai on May 9th. He arrived in Paris on June 9th and proceeded to Geneva the next morning. The conference was held from June 10th to 28th. Fifty-one member countries were represented, with a total of 86 government representatives, 35 employer representatives, 35 worker representatives, and 198 specialist advisors, totaling 354 individuals. China's full representation at this conference attracted considerable attention from other countries.</p>
<p>At the opening ceremony, Mr. Fontaines, the representative of the French government, delivered the opening address. Subsequently, Mr. Tom Shaw, the British Minister of Labour, proposed the election of Mr. Mahaim, the Belgian government representative, as the chairman of the conference. Three proposals were discussed: (1) the abolition of forced labor; (2) working hours for employees; and (3) working hours for coal miners. The conference adopted a committee system for discussing various proposals, dividing all attending representatives and specialist advisors into the following committees: (1) the Forced Labor Committee; (2) the Coal Miners Working Hours Committee; (3) Article 408 of the Treaty of Versailles Committee; (4) the General Affairs Committee; and (5) the Employee Working Hours Committee. The number of members on each committee was equally distributed among government, employer, and labor representatives. The Article 408 Committee of the Treaty of Versailles was the most important, with representatives fiercely debating the issues. Juehui was nominated to participate as a formal member of this committee, allowing him to review the labor laws and implementation systems of various countries. He also participated as a member of the Employee Committee.</p>
<p>The committees held separate meetings for two weeks. On June 19th, Juehui delivered a speech to the conference on the situation of Chinese laborers, extensively denouncing the imperialist aggression against China and detailing the oppression of Chinese workers in foreign-owned factories, as well as the constraints imposed by various unequal treaties and the May 30th Massacre. He also elaborated on the recent Japanese aggression against China. He stated that foreign-owned factories in China did not accept the Trade Union Law, Factory Law, and Labor-Capital Dispute Resolution Law promulgated by the Chinese National Government, so Chinese laborers still could not obtain adequate liberation. He also stated that the Japanese government, employer, labor representatives and advisors all walked out. It was said that the Japanese held a secret meeting that evening to plot a response, but the next day, the British representative took the stage and also expressed sympathy for China. Seeing that the atmosphere in the conference was very friendly towards China, the Japanese remained silent and endured, without making any arguments.</p>
<p>On June 24th, in the discussion on the Employee Working Hours report, Zhu Shikang, on behalf of Juehui, briefly described the situation of Chinese employees and supported the labor groups in the conference's proposal to adopt the draft convention. All representatives except the employer representatives expressed their approval. Therefore, in the voting, a majority of votes supported the proposal, and it was passed. The employees referred to in this draft convention include: (1) store and postal and telecommunications employees; (2) administrative employees; and (3) commercial and industrial employees. However, employees of hospitals, hotels, restaurants, theaters, etc. were excluded. The weekly working hours were limited to 48 hours, with 8 hours per day.</p>
<p>The case regarding abolishing forced labor was similar to that of the working hours for employees; besides the employer representatives, all advocated abolition and adopting the draft convention. Juehui also supported this proposal. The vote resulted in 78 votes in favor and only 21 against, with the majority passing the essential principles of the case: (1) the scope of forced labor refers to labor or work performed under threat of coercion or punishment, and not voluntarily; (2) however, the following are exceptions: A. Military work compulsorily requisitioned by military service laws; B. Work that is an obligation of citizens of an autonomous state; C. Results of a court judgment; D. Work caused by accidental events; E. Specific rural work that has direct benefits for the local community; (3) in addition to the above, the government should be responsible for abolishing forced labor. The issue of coal miners' working hours was entirely a European problem, as the United Kingdom wanted to shorten working hours to alleviate unemployment. This issue had no direct connection to China. However, Juehui proposed that the working hours be set at seven hours and forty-five minutes. The case that Juehui planned to raise was that workers at home and abroad should be treated equally. Upon arriving in Geneva, he sent a letter to the Director of the Labor Bureau, Mr. Thomas, requesting that it be included on the agenda, but as the conference was about to conclude, Mr. Thomas said that any proposals must be notified five days before the meeting, and that this case could only be discussed at the next conference.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that many proposals from various countries to the International Labor Bureau have been suppressed, such as the proposals submitted by the Chinese representatives to the 12th and 14th conferences, which have not yet been discussed. Juehui's proposal can only be urged again by the representatives attending the next conference, which is also a pity. This is a general summary of Juehui's experiences attending the International Labor Conference. After the report, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the same day, the National Government held its weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. Tan Yankai, Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Ma Fuxiang, Yi Peiji, Liu Ruiheng, Wang Zhengting, Zhang Nanxian, Zhu Lihe, Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Zheng Hongnian, Wang Jiazhen, Zhang Wohua, Zhou Yawei, Qiu Ao, Zhu Jingnong, Chen Yu, Mu Xiangyue, and over two hundred personnel, including civil servants, military adjutants, and staff from the General Staff Headquarters and the Compilation Committee, attended. After Chairman Tan Yankai led the ceremony, Secretary Qian Changzhao delivered a political report as follows: The League of Nations Assembly opened on the 10th. There are many issues to be discussed at this meeting. Political, legal, social, humanitarian, and financial budget issues have all been organized into committees for review. The most noteworthy issue is the Briand Plan for a European Federation. I have discussed the details and impact of this matter before, and it is difficult to predict the outcome. Although it has been approved by twenty-seven countries in an informal meeting and submitted to the League of Nations Assembly, such a large plan will definitely not be as simple or easy to implement as it seems. There will probably be another dispute. Judging from the international situation, whether international cooperation can truly be achieved and whether world peace can be permanently maintained is still unknown. We all know that the first requirement for international cooperation is peace, and so-called peace should emphasize the word "peace." If there is peace among nations, then all crises can be reduced, and the word "harmony" can be achieved. If we only emphasize the word "harmony" and there is still no peace among nations, then crises will be lurking everywhere and could erupt at any time. The League of Nations certainly knows this and is paying attention to peace. The military operations on the Longhai and Pinghan Railways are progressing very smoothly. The rebel Feng Yuxiang's troops are about to collapse completely. The rebel Yan Xishan's entire army has been annihilated and has absolutely no power to resist the central government. However, reports say that he has actually colluded with Wang Jingwei and Xie Chi and organized a puppet government in Beijing. This is truly digging one's own grave. After this, the internal disputes among various reactionaries to seize power and resources will definitely intensify, and the time of their demise will be closer and closer. What we should be concerned about now is that when the puppet government is in a very difficult financial situation, it will resort to any means, and some Chinese and foreign individuals, businesses, or companies may be tempted to enter into contracts or agreements with it for money or any other purpose. Such contracts or agreements that promote rebellion are of course absolutely invalid. At the same time, many antiquities in Beijing and other places will inevitably be transferred and sold illegally. If they are found, they should be severely punished. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a declaration on the above two points to draw the attention of China and foreign countries. The military situation on the Pinghan Line is progressing rapidly.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Song Meiling Passes Through Xuzhou to Guide to Guite to Console <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou correspondence: The point of decision between the Central Army and Feng's army has now shifted to the two wings of the Pinghan Line. The Central Army is focusing on intercepting Feng's army's retreat, preventing them from retreating into Tongguan, and also focusing on attacking the two wings to confuse the enemy about the location of the main force. According to a statement released by the Xuzhou Headquarters yesterday, the left wing of the Pinghan Line, Yang Hucheng, Liu Maoen and other troops have recovered Baofeng and Linru. The right wing, Xu Yuanquan, Shangguan Yunxiang and other troops, have recovered Xihua and Fugou. According to today's road news, there is indeed fierce fighting on both sides of the Pinghan Line in Denglin, Tongfu and other places. The Longhai Line is relatively quiet. The main Central Army force is still located more than ten miles west of the Nei Huang train station, with the two wings remotely approaching Lanfeng to encircle it. Feng's side is currently using a part of his direct army and miscellaneous troops to defend Lanfeng, and transferring most of his main army west to Zhengzhou to reinforce the south side of Bianluo. Therefore, both sides are focusing on the two sides of the Pinghan Line. Madam Chiang Kai-shek, Song Meiling, came to Xuzhou from Nanjing a few days ago and stayed at the British-American Tobacco Company for several days. She then took a train west on the evening of the 11th to Guite to meet Chiang and console the soldiers in the front. She returned to Xuzhou from Guite on the evening of the 12th and headed south. (13th) The war in Guizhou suddenly became more intense again near the Fu River.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Yunnan Army Occupies Wuming, Nanning Still Under Siege <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: The war in Guizhou Province has been quiet for a long time, but recently it has gradually become tense again. The situation on the Fu and Da Rivers has changed again. Some days ago, the Eighth Route Army withdrew its defense of the Fu River and divided two divisions and one brigade to advance along the Da River towards Binyang, aiming to join forces with the Tenth Route Army to attack Nanning and cut off the Liuzhou-Nanning traffic. After the Eighth Route Army advanced to Binyang, the Yunnan Army's Lu Han division immediately assigned its 98th Division Liu Brigade and 99th Division Zeng Brigade to besiege Nanning, with Gong Tuan of the 101st Division and the independent regiment as the general reserve to prevent the enemy from breaking out of the encirclement. To coordinate with the Eighth Route Army in Binyang and make Binyang and Wuming mutually reinforcing, a part of the army was specially dispatched to send the 98th Division's Sun Yu Brigade and one brigade of the 99th Division to attack Wuming from the left flank. On the 4th of this month, the Yunnan Army approached Wuming. Wuming is located about 110 miles east of Nanning and has no defensible terrain. Only the Lu Futing department, reorganized from the local militia, is stationed there, and the number of people is small and the guns are dilapidated. The Yunnan Army's Sun Brigade then ordered an attack on Wuming on the 5th. The Lu department initially resisted, but after several charges by the Yunnan Army, the momentum gradually became unsustainable. After fierce fighting until 12:00 on the 6th, the Lu department collapsed. The Yunnan Army then occupied Wuming on the evening of the 6th. With Wuming occupied, the road to Nanning was cut off. The city of Nanning may be broken without attacking. It is reported that the Wei Yun song unit in the city has approximately three to four thousand people and has been fleeing to Guilin in recent days. According to a telegram from the Yunnan Army's commander-in-chief, Lu Han, from the front, our army's Sun Brigade attacked Wuming on the 5th. Until noon on the 6th, the enemy's momentum was unsustainable. Brigade Commander Sun led his troops to occupy Wuming at 11:00 on the 7th. The remnants of the enemy fled to Shanglin. Now, teams are dispatched to attack in general. In particular, it was heard that Lu Han and Yu Yin said that the enemy has lost two key areas, Binyang and Wuming, in Nanning, and knows that Nanning cannot be held for long. In recent days, the Guizhou army Huang Shaoxiong and Huang Xuchu units guarding Yongzhou have retreated to Liuzhou. Therefore, the military situation above Xunzhou has eased slightly. The waterway from Guixian to Nanning is sometimes open and sometimes blocked, and ships operate without a fixed schedule. The 8th Route Army Guard Regiment is still stationed in Guixian. The 59th Division Training Regiment Peng Linsheng unit and the Supplementary Regiment Huang Zhinan unit are still stationed in Guiping. As for the Huang Renhuan brigade, they advanced to Zhangmu. A part of the 59th Division Yu Hanmou Division is stationed in Binyang, intending to join forces with the Huang brigade to attack Qianjiang. It was reported that a large part of the enemy had recently retreated from Qianjiang to Binzhou to Liuzhou and turned out to the Fu River. Therefore, they temporarily postponed their advance to return to the Fu River to block the attack. According to the latest news, the Guizhou army Liang Chaoqi and Huang Heling two units of the Fu River's Mengshan area were recently discovered to have arrived from Liuzhou and Luzhai. The troop strength is approximately three to four thousand. After arriving at Mengshan, they immediately went to the countryside to recruit labor and levy military rice. Each area must levy at least 500 catties of rice. It is unclear whether the Guizhou army intends to attack east or retreat into Xiangbian. However, Mengshan is only more than 300 miles away from Mengjiang, the fortress of the Da River. The 8th Route Army has stepped up its alert. The Huang Zhiwen unit of the 8th Route Army Li Yang□ Division is currently stationed at Chencun Pond above Mengjiang. Recently, the Miao Yufan and Lin Bin two regiments of the 63rd Division were transferred from Majiang to assist in the defense. This is the situation on the Fu River in recent days. (September 11th) The livelihood of overseas Chinese in Nanyang is becoming increasingly narrow.</p>
<h3 id="e52">British Authorities Will Extend the Restriction Period, Dutch Authorities Will Amend the Import Regulations <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Shantou correspondence: The unemployment problem has recently become a serious issue for various countries around the world. Waves are rising, and the overseas Chinese in Nanyang English and Dutch colonies are the first to be affected by this. According to statistics from the Singapore government, in the past ten years, a total of 2,301,869 overseas Chinese have gone to Singapore from Shantou, Hong Kong, Xiamen, and Haikou. The number of overseas Chinese returning home is 700,209. The number of overseas Chinese increased by 2,316,660 in Singapore in ten years. Therefore, the Singapore government restricted the entry of Chinese workers from September 1st due to the decline in the prices of rubber and tin blocks, stating that it would be a three-month trial period. If the market can be stabilized, it will continue to be extended. This matter is of great importance to the future of our country's overseas Chinese. It has not been heard whether our diplomatic authorities have had any communication with the British government on the matter. A reporter from a Shantou newspaper interviewed the British consulate yesterday. According to the British consulate, this regulation will be extended indefinitely.</p>
<p>In Thailand, strict new restrictions have been implemented since this month. The French colonies in Annam have even stricter regulations restricting overseas Chinese. Yesterday, the Nanxing Wheel arrived in Shantou and 134 overseas Chinese were deported. More than 90 of them were from Guangzhou. The Guangzhou-Zhao Association provided accommodation for them and issued 3 yuan per person to send them back to their hometowns. The rest were accommodated by the Shantou Overseas Chinese Hospital and various charitable halls. According to the overseas Chinese who were deported back to Shantou, the Annam government forced local overseas Chinese to pay a personal tax of 33.5 yuan per year. They must pay tax once a month. If the payment is delayed by one day, there will be a fine of 2 yuan. If they do not pay for one month, they will be arrested and imprisoned to work as street cleaners and road builders. As far as they know, no less than three to four hundred overseas Chinese have been arrested and imprisoned.</p>
<p>In addition, due to Singapore's restrictions on Chinese workers, the Dutch colonies of Batavia and other commercial ports in Nanyang have also increased their strict measures against China. According to those who returned to Shantou from Batavia, new arrivals must understand the following new rules: (1) the exit passport must be signed by the Dutch consul in China; (2) each person must pay 100 Dutch Indian guilders, which has been increased to 150 guilders this year; (3) when landing, there must be a store or employer to guarantee; (4) high-ranking merchants with capital industries do not need a guarantee; (5) they must not carry books and documents with political meaning; (6) all store employees, workers, and teachers must be guaranteed by a local store to enter the country; (7) old customers entering the country who return after the deadline will be treated as new customers and perform the above procedures; (8) pay an additional 50 guilders landing fee; (9) the original residence permit must be signed by the Civil Affairs Office and the主管官廳 otherwise it will be invalid; (10) old customers returning to Shantou must also obtain a passport when leaving the country and have it signed by the Dutch consulate, and verify the return passport issued by the Chinese consulate in the Netherlands. Absolutely do not bring books related to politics, otherwise they will be deported. The above are the new rules of the Dutch government for overseas Chinese. If our government does not negotiate to cancel them, I am afraid that the livelihood of overseas Chinese in Nanyang will become increasingly narrow and even cut off. (September 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Fujian Army Attacks Dehua <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen correspondence: Since Fang Shengtao went to Yongchun, the military situation in southern Fujian has been that the front launched a general offensive against Dehua on the 1st. The main force was Chen Guohui's unit of six battalions, about 1,500 people. The northern route was one division, Lin Qinglong's supplementary regiment, about 800 people. The western route was the first regiment of one division, Wang Zuqing's unit, about 1,500 people, combined with artillery and machine guns, about 4,000 people. Xu Feilong was entrenched in the earthen fort. The provincial army attacked the earthen fort with artillery. On the morning of the 5th, the first division, under the cover of artillery, charged to Zhangqian, three miles away from the city. On the 6th, they continued to shell it, with six mortars, two deployed on the 牛頭寨, one on the 西門宫顶, two on the 洞寨, one on the 北門頭. Five large guns were seven-borns, one deployed on the 牛頭寨, one deployed on the 洞寨, one remotely attacking the city. A total of 108 mortar shells and 86 large gun shells were fired. In addition, six water machine guns, three dry machine guns, and infantry launched assaults on the five key points of 牛頭寨, 西門宫顶, 砲壘洞寨, 北門頭 and earthen city. The Xiamen Naval Aviation Office also sent planes to Yongchun to transfer to Dehua on the 4th, 5th, and 6th to scout the enemy's situation and scatter Fang Shengtao's message to the army and people of Dehua. It briefly stated that Xu Feilong was guilty of rebellion and that the people must move to the countryside to avoid artillery fire. All of Xu's followers who can repent and return will not only not be punished but also heavily rewarded. Those who can capture Xu or offer his head will be rewarded with 5,000 yuan, and those who lead the crowd to return will be paid ten yuan per gun and allowed to be reorganized. The planes also dropped bombs on 雷公寨, destroying one earthen fort. The artillery battles continued on the 7th and 8th. On the 9th, the main force of Chen Guohui's unit occupied Caopuwe, cutting off the traffic between Dehua City and Xu Feilong's old nest, Sanban. On the same day, Lin Qinglong occupied Xidun and Moshi Ridge, cutting off the traffic between the north gate of Dehua City and Jiaoxi. On the 11th, Wang Zuqing's regiment occupied Tangsai outside the west gate. Therefore, Dehua City has been surrounded on all sides. The war in the fort lasted for four days. Lu Xingbang transported 30 dan of bullets from Datian to Xu Feilong, but they were intercepted by Zhang Ying's unit of Huang Qilan's department on Xishan. Therefore, Xu's unit was extremely short of bullets. It is expected that Dehua City will be captured soon. Once Dehua is down, the Liu Heding division will advance to the upper reaches of Datian, and jointly attack Youxi from Yongtai and Minqing. (12th)</p>

<h3 id="e54">Jiaoji Railway Holds Section Affairs Meeting <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Jinan correspondence: Since the war, the Jiaoji Railway has barely been open to traffic, and freight transport has only recovered seven or eight percent. The traffic order is also extremely chaotic. Tan Shukui, the deputy director of the Jiaoji Railway Vehicle Department, came to Jinan a few days ago to decide to hold a section affairs meeting of the Vehicle Department in Jinan. The meeting was held in the Jiaoji Station VIP room at 9:00 am today (13th). The attendees were Tan Shukui, deputy director of the Vehicle Department; Su Bubin, director of the first section; Ma Defang, director of the second section; Li Binting, director of the third section; Liu Dide, director of the fourth section; and Sui Jiwu, chief of the Vehicle Department's Documents Section; Wei Xin, chief of the Business Section; Li Shantang, chief of the Audit Section; Lu Jiaju, chief of the Telecommunications Section; Yuan Chucai, chief of the Traffic Stock; and Mr. Kagayama, the Japanese director of the Vehicle Department, was also present. After Chairman Tan Shukui opened the meeting, the chairman reported that the railway had suffered heavy losses in the war, and it was difficult to maintain the status quo, and the railway's life was tied to the Vehicle Department, so the department should hold a section affairs meeting to discuss traffic order, maintain income, and other matters. In previous years, section affairs meetings were held in Qingdao, but this time, due to the war, it was necessary to understand the situation of each station to provide reference material for the meeting so that good results could be discussed. This was not very relevant to the section chiefs, but it was very important for the colleagues in the department, so it was moved to Jinan. Afterwards, various issues concerning vehicle affairs were raised and discussed separately: (1) Regarding freight transport: due to various reasons, the railway is short of freight cars, and has only recovered seven or eight percent. In order to increase income and facilitate freight transport, the railway should find ways to remedy the situation. It was decided that in addition to requesting the military authorities to return military vehicles, the existing vehicles should be used to increase turnover rate, reduce the parking time at each station, and accelerate loading and unloading to free up time to increase the number of trips and remedy freight transport. (2) Regarding order: in the past, soldiers were not allowed to ride the train without a ticket. It is not surprising that this could not be implemented after the war. However, the railway's income depends entirely on the Vehicle Department, so the traffic order should be restored immediately to maintain income. It was decided that the issue of soldiers riding the train without a ticket had been agreed by Sun Junzhang (Tongxuan) of the 12th Army and Cao Junzhang (Fulin) of the 14th Army, and they were allowed to instruct and strictly prohibit it. The department should now strictly formulate ticket inspection methods and issue orders to implement them conscientiously. (3) Regarding hygiene: the hygiene facilities on the railway's trains are more complete than other railways and can be implemented conscientiously. This should be done to improve the sanitation after the war. It was decided that the section chiefs should be responsible for instructing the staff at each station and on the trains to strictly implement cleanliness and hygiene, and to investigate and prohibit passengers from engaging in unhygienic behavior. The section chiefs must also inspect from time to time and not treat it as a mere formality. (4) Regarding staff: how should the staff in the war zone who served at risk during the war and those who temporarily evaded responsibility be handled? It was decided that the staff in the war zone suffered great losses both mentally and physically and should be transferred to the rear for rest or to a station with simpler affairs for adjustment. The staff who temporarily evaded responsibilities should be punished according to the circumstances. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 pm. I visited Mr. Tan Shukui after the meeting. According to Tan, the decisions made at this section affairs meeting are the most important matters at present, because the railway's business prospects are extremely difficult to be optimistic about. In previous years, the railway's income was about 11 million yuan per year, excluding salary expenses, material expenses, and daily interest of 2.4 million yuan, there was a net profit of about one million yuan. This year's business income is expected to increase by one-third compared to last year, reaching more than 14 million yuan. However, the income has already been reduced by more than 3 million due to the war. Although the income may be barely 11 million by the end of this year, the railway employees have increased their salaries, and during the war period in the war zone, the employees were paid three times their salary according to the Ministry of Railways' order. Since the increase in gold prices, the materials needed by the railway have increased more than in previous years, and military transport costs more than passenger and freight transport. Due to all these factors, the expenses this year will be 8 million yuan, and the balance of revenue and expenditure is only 3 million yuan, while the daily debt interest of 2.4 million yuan needs to be paid in gold, which requires more than 4 million yuan at the current price. Therefore, the daily debt interest this year is really difficult. As for the repair of bridges, it is estimated that it will cost more than 1.5 million yuan, which is out of the question now. It is heard that Tan will return to Qingdao tomorrow (14th), and the section chiefs will depart from Jinan tomorrow to conduct on-the-spot inspections of each station in Zhangdian, Boshan, and Jinlingzhen.

<p>The Eastern Railway Bureau Establishes a Translation Office</p>
<h3 id="e55">Annual Allocation of 400,000 Yuan for Chinese-Russian Translation Affairs <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Harbin correspondence: On the 6th of this month, the Eastern Railway Bureau received an order from the Council to establish a translation office in the bureau with an annual allocation of 400,000 yuan as regular expenses. The office will have a director and two deputy directors. The director will be Chinese and the deputy directors will be Russian. All the original translators in each department under the jurisdiction of the bureau will be transferred to the translation office to serve, specializing in translating Chinese documents into Russian and receiving and dispatching documents from all parties. After the Chinese documents are translated, they will be sent directly to the director, who will review them and then send them to each department for review and processing. The Russian documents will be received and dispatched by the office and then submitted to the director. At present, the bureau has begun to organize, and it should be established by the middle of next month. However, the way this matter is being handled is quite unsatisfactory to the Chinese directors of each department. The case of using both Chinese and Russian documents has been in dispute for many years. This spring, the Council decided to allow the bureau to reply. After several months, the bureau replied to the Council with a plan that was roughly the same. The Chinese directors were shocked when they heard the news and jointly opposed the move. The reason was that the current affairs of each department were able to proceed smoothly because of the service of these translators, who conveyed each other's opinions and avoided misunderstandings. If a translation office is specially set up in the future to concentrate the translation in one place, then the affairs of each department will not be as convenient as in the past, and it is feared that the Russian side will use the translation office to increasingly concentrate power in the director. After it was sent to the Council, it was not approved. No one has discussed this matter much in the past two months. Suddenly, an unexpected order was issued instructing them to quickly prepare for it. After the Chinese directors heard the news, they still planned to oppose it, but they were afraid that they would not be able to eliminate it. (September 8th)</p>

<p>The chief bandit of the Yangxupu gang was arrested. Qi Ajin, a notorious bandit who specialized in extorting ransoms from people in the Jiangzhuang area of Punan, was arrested last year, interrogated by the county government, and executed by firing squad. His henchmen, Lu A'er and Lu A'jun, gathered 30-40 of Qi Ajin's former subordinates, possessed more than ten guns, and called themselves the Yangxupu gang, attached to the Pudong gang in Taihu Lake. They committed crimes such as extortion, fraud, and obstruction in Yangxupu, Jiangzhuang, and other places in the southern countryside. They were not afraid of the law, and the villagers were overwhelmed by their harassment. Fearing retaliation, the villagers did not dare to report to the authorities, and the bandit's power became even more rampant. Recently, detective police from the First Branch of the Tinglin Public Security Bureau learned of the situation and reported it to Director Pan. Director Pan led the police on a night raid and arrested Lu and others. It was also discovered that after hearing that their leaders had been arrested, the remaining bandits held meetings at Wang Rongsheng's teahouse and in the home of Dr. Zhu Luxiang in Jiangzhuang. Director Pan went to arrest them again, but the bandits had already fled upon hearing the news. Only Wang Rongsheng, Zhu Hexiang's son, and the bandit Tang Awu, a total of five people, were arrested. After a brief interrogation, they were sent to Songjiang for further investigation yesterday.</p>
<p>The county court prosecutor was transferred. Prosecutor Lu of the county court, who had been transferred from Xiaoxian County to Songjiang, was transferred to Jiangdu County as prosecutor by the High Court before he had served for a month. The vacancy in the Songjiang court was filled by Guanghai, who took office in Songjiang the day before yesterday.</p>

<p>The water police captured bandits who will be escorted to the province for disposal. Du Jingwu, the leader of the first squad of the 14th team of the 3rd District of the Water Public Security Bureau, and Pei Xuan, the leader of the second squad of the guerrilla team, patrolled and searched for lake bandits in the Nankumiao area last month and successively captured Wang Heshang, Wang Xiaochen, Zheng Yousi, Liu Xueshu, and other four people. After interrogation by District Chief Gong Guoliang, the bandits confessed to robbery and kidnapping on various villages and confessed to having kidnapped the Dongshan Flying Tiger and Dalu small steamboats. He immediately reported it separately to the Three Provinces Bandit Suppression Department, the Provincial Security Office, and the Civil Affairs Department to request instructions for disposal. It is now heard that Director Li of the Provincial Security Office intends to escort the four bandits, including Wang Heshang, to the province for disposal.</p>
<p>Yang Xiping died strangely. Mao Jingzhi, the principal of Luowan Elementary School in Xishan, is the nephew of Mao Mujun, the district chief of the second district of the Wuxi Water Public Security Bureau. On August 7th, he accompanied his fiancée Yang Xiping and Xiping's distant nephew Yang Hangquan (25 years old, from Wujin, currently a teacher at Donghe Elementary School in Xishan), as well as Yang's concubine Zhu Tanru (38 years old) and Zhu Tanru's eldest daughter Lanzhen and second daughter Junyan to Suzhou, staying at the Hengxing Inn in Xiguanqiao. Zhu Lanzhen took the entrance exam for the [?]hai Women's School and was admitted. Junyan failed the exam for the [?]guan Sericulture School and stayed at the inn. Zhu Tanru suddenly demanded six hundred yuan in old debts from Mao Jingzhi, but Mao had no money to pay. He returned to Changzhou to raise money and originally intended to take Xiping with him, but Zhu Tanru prevented him from leaving. Mao left Xiping in Suzhou and left Suzhou alone, never to return. At that time, Xiping was already pregnant. Zhu Tanru repeatedly pressured Xiping for money at the inn. On the 10th of this month, she died due to a change in her pregnancy. Yang Hangquan pretended to be the deceased's uncle and obtained permission from the court to waive an autopsy. Yesterday (the 15th), Fang Ziqing, the patrol officer in charge of the second branch, learned of this and brought Yang Hangquan, Zhu Tanru, Zhu Junyan, and the cunning man Miaofa, who lived in the inn, to the station. Miaofa testified to the previous events. Patrol Officer Fang deemed that Yang Hangquan, the deceased's nephew, was pretending to be the deceased's uncle to request a waiver of the autopsy, which was suspicious. He brought them to the second branch for interrogation.</p>
<p>Zhejiang kidnappers were caught in Suzhou. A wealthy merchant from Dakiankou, Huzhou, Zhejiang, nicknamed Sanlao[?], and his junior partner were kidnapped by Zhang Yousan, Zhu Laowozi, Zhou Changhai, Zhao Guangfu, Zhang Yunbao, and other kidnappers last month. The hostages were taken to Meiyan Changyang East Beach for hiding, and a letter was sent to the hostage's family demanding a large ransom. After receiving the letter, the hostage's family entrusted someone to negotiate, and they agreed on 11,000 yuan. On the 9th of this month, they paid 5,500 yuan in advance. After Zhang[?] and others obtained the money, they had an internal dispute over the distribution of the spoils. Zhang Yunbao was shot and killed by Zhu Laowozi. Zhang Yousan obtained 1,000 yuan and fled to Suzhou. Ma Kezhong, the leader of the third squad of the 14th team of the 3rd District of the Water Public Security Bureau, learned of this and tracked him to Suzhou. On the night before last, he joined Patrol Officer Qiu Yongbiao of the 32nd branch of the Public Security Bureau to arrest him outside of the Lizhi Gate. He was immediately sent to the headquarters for verification. Yesterday (the 15th), District Chief Gong of the 3rd District of the Water Public Security Bureau sent personnel to the Public Security Bureau to pick him up and handle the case.</p>

<p>[?]The Court Appoints a Commissioner to Investigate the Sun Case. Former Wuxi County Magistrate Sun Zuji bailed out eight criminals before leaving office. Zhang Tong, Yang Chongyuan, Yang Zushu, and others from Wuxi believed that Sun Zuji was suspected of taking bribes to release prisoners and filed a [?] name complaint with the Provincial Government, the Civil Affairs Department, and the Jiangsu High Court. The Civil Affairs Department ordered the county to investigate the case. County Magistrate Pan sent political police to arrest and imprison the released criminals, and Liang Sanda, Gu Bohe, and others were successively apprehended. There are still three people who are being secured and ordered to surrender. The day before yesterday, Director Hu of the Civil Affairs Department specially appointed a commissioner to come to Wuxi to investigate the matter. Yesterday, President Lin of the High Court also sent judge Zheng Zhiguo to Wuxi to investigate. After getting off the train, he went directly to the county government to review the files. According to Judge Zheng, the procedures for each case seemed incomplete. At around 6:00 pm, Mr. Zheng took the car back to Suzhou to report back. Meat Industry Opposes Increasing Slaughter Tax. Wang Yun, a merchant who acknowledges the slaughter tax of the local meat industry, has been contracting the city and township meat industry slaughter tax to the Education Funding Management Office since May of the seventeenth year. It has been more than two years since. The Wuxi City Council has increased the tax amount twice. Recently, Wang Yun sent a letter to Jiang Hongzhang, the executive director of the Meat Industry Association, stating that the original amount must be increased by 20% and a loan of 2,000 yuan must be prepaid, otherwise another person will be recruited for bidding and contracting and be calculated on a per head basis. After receiving the letter, Mr. Jiang convened an emergency meeting of all colleagues at the public office the day before yesterday. All members unanimously decided to deny the increase. The reason for the opposition was that Wang Yun was an outsider and was not allowed to contract the meat industry tax. The Ministry Order had long stipulated that it should be calculated on a per head basis. According to the situation in various counties in Jiangsu Province, Wang Yun should be fully responsible. The letter was immediately sent to deny it. Yesterday, Wang Yun received a reply letter, saying that once the calculation is done on a per head basis, it will inevitably hurt feelings, and I hope to reply immediately. The meat industry has not yet replied after receiving the letter, and there is a stalemate.</p>
<p>Water Police Encounter Bandits on the Way to Receive Wages. Sun Rongjing, supervisor and chief accountant of the 2nd District of the Water Police, was ordered to go to the Liuhe County Finance Bureau to receive the district's wages for last month (allocated by the Financial Council's instructions). He and Patrol Officer Xiong Bin went to Zhenjiang to take a boat to Liuhe to receive a large amount of wages. On the 11th, he took the Tongchun small wheel of the Tiantai Company from Liuhe back to Zhenjiang and then transferred to Wuxi. When the wheel was passing Donggou, gunshots were heard on both sides. Before long, about twenty armed security group members came. At that time, the wheel had stopped and the gunshots had also stopped. The members of the group went straight to the boat and tied up six people who looked like military officers. Passengers were very surprised. It was only afterwards that they learned that bandits were planning to attack the wheel and the accomplices disguised themselves as passengers and got off the boat, and used the gunshots as a signal to respond from the inside and outside. Fortunately, the security group there learned of it in advance and was on strict alert. Yesterday, Chief Accountant Sun had already taken the money back to Wuxi and returned to the district office to report. Lake Bandits Discovered in Maqi Mountain. Maqi Mountain in Wujin County is adjacent to Xueyanqiao and faces Taihu Lake. There have always been bandit problems. On the morning of the day before yesterday, more than one hundred lake bandits suddenly appeared in three lake boats in the Dongniu area of the mountain. Residents were shocked and immediately reported to the Xueyanqiao Security Group, which was on strict alert and sent a special commissioner to Wuxi to report the Water Police 2nd District to send shallow-water warships to encircle and suppress the bandits in order to quell the bandit atmosphere.</p>

On the night of the 12th, the squad was approved by the Wudan Joint Defense Association to report that bandits were publicly traveling on the streets of Tantangzhuang Bridge, so the squad leader joined forces with the chamber of commerce and the public security bureau to go to the scene and arrest Zou Dengkui, a known bandit, and Cai Tingsheng and Cai Dengyun, a father and son who were suspects. According to Hao Dengkui, he confessed to murder, robbery, and other crimes without hesitation. Cai Dengyun and his son did not admit to being bandits. The squad leader immediately prepared a document and sent the three criminals to the company headquarters in the city on the 14th for interrogation.</p>

The soldiers and civilians were outraged and excavated Ma Yuren's ancestral tomb in Menglang to vent their anger. The injured soldiers are about to return to the team. There are a total of 1,591 wounded soldiers in the 31st Rear Hospital in Nantong. In the past two months, in addition to those who died, escaped, and were deported, there are still 1,470 people.

<p>Confiscation of Copper Coin Case Three Records. The first branch of the Public Security Bureau confiscated a large number of copper coins that were being smuggled out. This newspaper has reported on this case three times. It is now heard that the county government has ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate whether the copper coins were being smuggled out or transported to various villages to buy rice and wheat, and to report the details for verification. It is heard that the director of the Public Security Bureau, after receiving the order, ordered the branch to escort the confiscated copper coins to the bureau and sent personnel to investigate whether there were any malpractices in trafficking for profit. However, the Chamber of Commerce strongly argued that even if there were occasional copper coin trafficking exports, it would not have any impact on the livelihood of laborers and the environment of the commercial and financial markets, which is not comparable to the smuggling of imports to raise foreign prices. Moreover, the copper coins were not confiscated at wharfs or stations, so how can it be said to be smuggling? Because the two sides have different views, it has not been properly handled until today. The amount of money is indeed twenty vehicles. The so-called fifteen vehicles in yesterday's report was a transcription error.</p>

<p>Banditry Recurrence in Xixiang. Since the bandits of the Danyang-Juyi border area were severely suppressed by the joint military and police forces, the remaining bandits have fled to the Jinniudong area at the foot of Maoshan and toward Liyang. It is now heard that after the anti-bandit military and police returned to defend the area, another group of bandits, about 200 in number, secretly returned to Houzhuang, near the Baitu town of Juyi County. This area is close to the border of Xixiang in Danyang County, and the police team of the county has been sent to guard the area. Another group drove away the villagers in Shangdang and Shangwan in Zhenyi, occupied them as their nests, and dared to openly kill, set fires, bind, and extort, and were rampant. Fengluo Ditang in Xixiang, this county, is very close, and the people were panicked when they heard the bandit alarm. They supported the old and carried the young, and fled to the city one after another, and launched representatives to jointly petition the county government to send more police teams to garrison the area for deterrence.</p>

Since Luo Jialun left Tsinghua, all school affairs have been discussed and handled by the school affairs meeting composed of the dean of studies, the secretary-general, the dean of the liberal arts college, the dean of the science college, and the dean of the law college. Now, the Ministry of Education has shelved Luo Jialun's resignation and feels that it is beyond its reach to deal with the aftermath. As for the North, although Qiao Wanxuan changed his policy after his last unsuccessful attempt to take over Tsinghua, it was still ineffective. There were rumors that Gu Mengyu would take over, but the general public was indifferent to it. Because the Northern authorities are busy dealing with military and political affairs, the question of Tsinghua has not yet been discussed.</p>
<p>The Dean of Studies is About to be Elected. The dean of studies of Tsinghua was originally filled by Wu Zhichun, the director of the Department of Political Science. Since the question of the president arose, although all affairs were decided by the school affairs meeting, Wu assumed more responsibility due to his position. Therefore, those who coveted Tsinghua said that Wu was controlling school affairs and plotting to become the president. Wu was very negative after hearing this and resigned from the position of dean of studies, and stated that he would not be responsible for matters concerning the dean of studies from August 1st. Recently, with the start of the school year approaching, the position of dean of studies must be filled, so the school affairs meeting telegraphed the Ministry of Education to ask for instructions. The reply telegram said that the faculty meeting could elect an agent. It is heard that the school affairs meeting has issued an official letter setting the morning of September 8th to convene a faculty meeting to elect an acting dean of studies and discuss school affairs. School will start on the 15th. The school affairs meeting announced that new students will report from September 8th to 9th, and a qualification test for new students will be held on the 10th. Old students will pay tuition and register from the 11th to the 13th. The opening ceremony will be held on the morning of the 15th, and classes will begin in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The Student Union Welcomes New Students. This year, the new students who have been admitted, including freshmen, transfer students from the second and third years, and graduate students, total about 250. They have come from afar through water and mountains. Being new to Beijing, the Student Union, according to Tsinghua's practice, organizes a new student reception committee to handle reception and welcome affairs every year. This year, the Tsinghua Summer Weekly specially printed a special issue to welcome new students, which roughly divides the current situation of Tsinghua, the question of the president, the situation of each department, and how to use the library, gymnasium, and so on.</p>
<p>Recent Developments in Architectural Development. The Tsinghua construction projects, including the biology building, the observatory, the library, and the student dormitory, are all planned and undertaken by the Tianjin-Keelung Construction Company. Construction began last fall and has been underway for a year. According to the contract, the biology building and the student dormitory should be completed before the start of the school year, but in fact they cannot be completed in one or two weeks and will have to be postponed for two or three weeks. The construction of the library will be completed at the end of the year, and the construction of the observatory is just beginning. It is said that the physiology building requires an expenditure of 150,000 yuan, the student dormitory 120,000 yuan, the library 260,000 yuan, and the observatory 40,000 yuan. It is also planned to start building a girls' dormitory after the start of the school year. As for the library expenditure, it was 140,000 yuan last year and has increased to 170,000 yuan this year.</p>
<p>Now that the social economy is bankrupt, it is not easy for national schools in Beijing to maintain the status quo, while Tsinghua has sufficient funds, a beautiful environment, and is expanding and developing. All the professors are domestic scholars, and the tuition fee is only 20 yuan per year. Some people consider Tsinghua to be a bargain, which is very reasonable. I sincerely hope that the students will make use of such a beautiful environment and the precious time that you have worked so hard to obtain. Devote yourselves to academic studies and work hard in research. Do not miss this opportunity.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education previously approved the Central Executive Committee Training Department's inquiry on whether there was a need for detailed regulations on the award and punishment methods for principals of all levels of schools who can work hard to implement party ideology education, and hoped that they would review it again. After the Ministry of Education sent personnel to discuss the matter, it seemed that it could be temporarily delayed and specially replied to the Training Department. The previous official letter from your department No. 9545 stated that whether there was a need for detailed regulations on the award and punishment methods for principals of all levels of schools who implemented party ideology education should be reviewed again. The department sent Counselor Zhao Nai Chuan Kong to your department for consultation and issued it to the supervisors of your department for detailed review. Now, according to the counselor’s reply, the results of the two consultations are that the “Rules for Assessing the Research Achievements of Party Ideology by Faculty and Staff of All Levels of Schools,” the “Measures for Examining the Achievements of Party Ideology Education in All Levels of Schools,” and the “Provisional Regulations on the Study of Party Ideology by Faculty and Staff of All Levels of Schools” have been promulgated by the Central Committee and ordered by the Ministry to be followed, and the regulations have been announced and all levels of schools should implement them earnestly, and the results of the research on party ideology will be considerable over time. As for the methods for awarding and punishing principals of all levels of schools for implementing party ideology education, it seems that there is no need to make separate detailed regulations at present. After consulting with your department, it is understood that your department agreed that the methods for awarding and punishing principals of all levels of schools for implementing party ideology education can be temporarily postponed, and the letter is replied accordingly.</p>

The original ten schools require more than 6,000 yuan in annual funding. Promoting universal education can start by adding levels. Each additional level costs 150 yuan in start-up fees and 316 yuan in recurring expenses. Adding a school costs 250 yuan in start-up fees and 348 yuan in recurring expenses. Currently, 1,455 children in Liuhang Township are not enrolled. Assuming 50 people per level, it is estimated that about□ 29 levels or 2 schools and 27 levels will be added to reach the popularization period. The plans for the three-year popularization period and the five-year popularization period are listed in separate tables. Huang Renzhi reported that Mr. Yuan advocated setting up distribution schools that integrate moral education into agriculture and industry to prevent students from dropping out. This proposal has been very effective. Wu Shiqiao reported on the Baoshan memorial methods: (1) The family members have already agreed to the public burial site, and the location is being planned. (2) The private sanctuary is currently planned to have three locations, which will be decided by the public at the memorial service.

<p>The Zhengfeng College of Arts at No. 1 Jiaozhou Road is adding a three-story Western-style house at No. 38 Jiaozhou Road across from the school building as a second dormitory because the original dormitory is not enough to accommodate the large number of students this semester.

<p>In terms of technology, Xuri's Zhu Mengling played well in the match between Central and Xuri, and he is also a veteran of the table tennis world, in the same class as Jin Jiming. However, because the Central team had average strength and a lot of talent, it won five to two. Youyi is organized by colleagues from the Post Office and is guided by famous generals such as Lu Xiu and Li Chuanshu. Because of their excellent technology, they are all in Group A. Although they have an advantage outside, they are ultimately no match for the Central Trust Company team, which has been organized for a long time. Zhongxin has a strong team and defeated Zhongxin by a score of six to one. Feima vs. Shabu: Zhu Jianzhang, a strong player in Feima, was negligent in hitting the ball and was defeated by Fang Fangjun, a sincere player, by a score of one to three, which was unexpected. Xu Baomin and Ye Quangen are both rising stars, both good at defense and attack. Feima won two games in a row. Cheng Zhiyuan was originally one of Shanghai's top three Jia players and a member of the Golden Star team. He has been training for many years and has excellent skills, defeating Wang Ju by a score of one to three. Yang Changgeng is a veteran of the Shabu team, so he was even more □ in the battle with Wang Shuying, winning the sixth game by a score of zero to three. Lu Changhui played in the seventh game for Feima and won by a score of three to zero. The spectators were enthusiastic about this game, and the cheers were even louder.

<p>Dentist (to his neighbor's child): Your father is really a miser. He owns a shoe store and can make shoes himself. Why does he always make you wear broken shoes?</p>
<p>Son of the shoe worker: That's not the point. For example, you are a dentist, so why does your little brother only have one tooth?</p>

<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>The elderly Yu Juanzhi of Changsha, a recluse in Shanghai, passed away on the 17th of this month at the age of seventy-seven. Alas! The gentleman was appointed to the Ministry of Works as a tribute scholar and changed to Prefect, serving in Hubei, successively holding positions in Jingzhou, Hanyang, and Wuchang. Wherever he went, officials feared him and the people cherished him. His reputation spread far and wide. He □ rose to the position of Jingyi Shi Xiangyang Dao, with the expectation of being a regional official. When Jiang Zhaotang of Nanchang County was murdered, he negotiated the case with reason and fought for it, supported by public opinion. This is what is now called strong diplomacy. He disobeyed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and □ had his rank removed and left his job. After a long time, Minister of Law Dai Wenjian awarded him the position of Left Counselor of the Ministry of Law, but he did not take office. When the party disaster occurred, he was condemned and expelled in accordance with the wishes of Privy Councilor Qu Wenshen. He both embraced the loyalty of Huai Sha and experienced the sorrow of Gaoyu's loss of the country. He resigned himself to spending his old age in a poor rural area, but due to frequent bandit troubles, he hurriedly opened up land to seek refuge in the concession, which was not his original intention. The gentleman loved talent like Pang Shiyuan, encouraging later generations, often exaggerating the truth. As a junior relative, I was fortunate to receive his knowledge early, but I have no learning, no official career, and white hair on my temples after surviving the tiger's mouth. It has already deserted Lu Shi's village and does not dance with Yang Gong's cranes. I have exhausted my strength to come to Shanghai, indulging in literature and wine, and relatives' words are also very pleasing. However, the flames of war have continued for years, thorns and thorns are everywhere, the day is late and the road is far, what kind of world is this? Heaven's will and human affairs can be a source of sadness and heartache. How can an elegy be completed? His couplet says: His heart hangs in the sky, his loyalty shines brightly, his meritorious name is a trivial matter in the annals of time, his articles are praised in the north, his eyes are full of vicissitudes, his feelings are vast and touching, and one day, the hill collapses, and someone cries sadly over the west continent.</p>
<h3 id="e89">The Novel Fanatic of Today <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>I recently read in the newspaper that two students in Wuxi were so fascinated by martial arts novels that they left without saying goodbye, intending to travel around and find a teacher. Also, this month's Zi Lin Xi Bao also reported that a twelve-year-old Russian child, Fan Zige Fusi, was so fond of reading nautical novels that he secretly took two other Russian children on a sampan, intending to float to Qingdao. Fortunately, they were found by their family the next day and taken back. The magic of novels is so great that it cannot but be shocking. However, the above two stories all came from the actions of young children, and it may be considered that they have simple minds and are not worth mentioning. However, when I turned to Western magazines, I found that even older writers and travelers were also fascinated by novels and tried to experience the realm of the ancients. The matter is quite bizarre, so I translated it to provide a smile.</p>
<p>It is not easy to do the business of Robinson Crusoe in the present century, but there is indeed a second Robinson Crusoe in the world today. Who is he? It is the Englishman Harry Burden. Mr. Harry is good at literature and loves to travel. He once set sail and arrived at Dupanggu Island, living in a cave for a month. All the clothes were imitated from Robinson Crusoe's original ones, and his companions were a parrot, a hound, and a goat. Later, he found a native on the island, and because the date he met him was a Thursday, he called him Thursday. He has nothing to do all day, so he fells large trees on the island, hollows them out, and makes canoes for fishing and hunting. However, Robinson Crusoe's original purpose was to leave the island and return to his country, but he had no such thoughts. If the magazine's record is very accurate, then Mr. Harry is truly worthy of being an outstanding member of the novel fanatic.</p>

<p>Lotus Seed Porridge: Fresh lotus pods are shelled, peeled, and the hearts removed, then cooked into porridge with fragrant japonica rice in a sand pot. It is exceptionally clear and fragrant.</p>
<p>Chestnut Soup: Chestnuts are shelled, peeled, and cut in half, then fried in a pot until crispy. Then add osmanthus honey and a little white sugar. It is fragrant and sweet, and the taste is no different from real osmanthus chestnut.</p>
<p>Persimmon Steamed Balls: Peel the persimmons and mash them in a stone mortar with a pestle. Mix with glutinous rice flour and knead into balls. For the salty version, use dried □ vegetables, shrimp, and meat filling. For the sweet version, use a filling of dried fruit, bean paste, and sugar.

<p>Cheng Yanqiu has already agreed with the Grand Theatre to leave for the South after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Before leaving Beijing, he is still performing at the Harbin Theatre. The actors in the same class include Guan Dayuan, Hao Shoushen, and Zhou Rui'an. It was previously said that Cheng would go to Dalian, but according to a letter from a Beijing friend, this statement has been refuted.</p>
<p>Li Huiqin, who came to Shanghai with Li Guifen last year, has now invited Wang Youchen and Shang Heyu to form a separate class, first at Zhonghe and now moving to Kaiming.</p>
<p>Among the Kun roles in Beijing, in addition to the already famous Xue Yanyun and Xin Yanqiu, the most popular and artistically refined is Du Liyun, a female disciple of Wang Yaoqing. Du's □ appearance is gorgeous, and her voice is clear and melodious. She is able to perform hundreds of plays, all of which have been individually instructed by Yaoqing. Her ability to sing at Kaiming for half a year without her audience diminishing is unparalleled. Du is originally from the South, so it is unexpected that she can enjoy such a reputation in the North. It is now heard that Du will go to Tianjin within a few days to respond to the invitation of the Chunhe Theatre. The person traveling with her is the beardless student Yan Jupeng.</p>
<p>An Shuyuan, who has been away from Shanghai for a long time, has made considerable progress recently, and his voice is also clearer than before. Last time, he partnered with Yang Xiaolou in Yangping Pass, and his reputation was greatly enhanced. He is currently performing on the same stage with Xin Yanqiu at Huale.</p>
<p>Yang Xiaolou went to Jiuhua Mountain for summer retreat this summer due to his unhappy mood (repeatedly confronting his stepson Kan Ming in court). Now that it is autumn, he has returned to Beijing a few days ago and is performing on the same stage with his son-in-law Liu Yanfang (Xiao Wutong) in the Yongsheng Society organized by him. The people on the same stage include Xin Yanqiu and An Shuyuan.</p>
<p>The remaining roles also have their respective territories. Except for Gao Qingkui, who stopped acting due to his father's death, and Ma Lianliang and Zhu Qinxin, who went to Tianjin, the rest all took to the stage. Xun Huisheng and Guan Dayuan are paired with Zhonghe, Shang Xiaoyun and Tan Fuying are paired with Jixiang, and Xu Biyun and Li Wanchun are paired with Kaiming. Cheng Yanqiu, in addition to one game at Harbin, also occasionally performs at Zhonghe.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Miscellaneous Talks on Phonographs and Records <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Bo</p>
<p>I have been immersed in records for nearly twenty years. Whenever I meet friends, they ask me about my interest in records. Some may even regard me as an experienced guide. If there are matters of purchasing phonographs or records, they must ask me to decide what to buy. Initially, I felt overwhelmed by the booming record industry and the profusion of new releases, making it hard to choose. However, I have a peculiar fondness for this, and have spent almost half my life on it. Therefore, I have a considerable understanding of the quality of various records.</p>
<p>The effort put into recording has brought about a special kind of progress and given us excellent news. My interest in records has grown even stronger. However, if the recording of electric sound records is poorly arranged, or if the technician is unskilled, the result can be unbearable. Fortunately, this is rare. However, it is common for records to have different sound levels. First Company records have different levels of bass, so needles come in three types: high, medium, and low, making it easier for phonograph owners to choose.</p>
<p>Regarding phonographs, from my perspective, if financially possible, it's best to buy the highest quality one. The beautiful sound it produces can dispel worries and be even better than the original singer. Through my experience over the years and research with friends, it seems that the Brunswick sound head provides the most accurate sound. Next would be Victor. The machine should also be large (or custom-made, if you can get the sound head, it will be cheaper than imported ones). A larger sound gate is also necessary. The minimum diameter of the sound gate should be eight inches, and larger is better. The internal sound horn should not be made of metal, otherwise the beauty of the singer's flesh and blood voice will be lost. The price of a custom-made floor phonograph is only about two hundred yuan. If you buy an imported one, due to the high price of gold, even a machine with a lid but no legs will cost around two hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding record quality, I find the recently released "Kaiming" records satisfactory. Not only is the sound clear and loud—some complain it's too loud, but it sounds wonderful with a fine needle—but the quality is far superior to others. The selection of dramas is also very sophisticated. The roles are well-organized, and there are many complete dramas with dialogues and singing. The sound levels of each record are also consistent, which is commendable.</p>

<p>— Wang Jin</p>
<p>The idea of immortality is promoted by alchemists, recorded in unofficial histories, and believed by women and children. Scholars, however, dismiss it as superstition. The "Shen Bao" reported a few years ago that an old man in Sichuan was over two hundred years old, which was considered a marvel. Yesterday, I heard that Liu Xing, the former commander of the Eighth Army, sent a letter to his brother from New York, saying that there was a 297-year-old man in America. Is there really such a thing as immortality? Here is a summary of the letter:</p>
<p>"On the ninth day after I (Liu Xing) arrived in New York, I took a plane to a certain place (I forgot the name). Due to heavy fog, we landed in a village, which translates to 'Spring Valley.'"</p>
<p>"I found this village to be a paradise compared to the noisy days and nights of New York. I was drawn to its tranquility and stayed for a week. The pilot flew back the same day. There, I met an old man who claimed to be 297 years old. Besides one great-great-grandchild, he has no relatives. He has the face of a child, white hair, and walks very fast. When asked how he achieved such longevity, he replied: 'I do not eat, drink, sleep, or laugh at the wrong time. I do not argue with people or go against nature. I adapt to circumstances, and I do not worry or fret.' The village has over a hundred residents, mostly natives. They are all kind and friendly. There is a stream over two hundred li long. I took a canoe to the stream's exit and then took a boat back to New York. The village is about a thousand miles from New York."</p>
<p>The above letter was dictated by my friend Mr. Deng. I heard that the entire letter was about three thousand words long. - Wang Jin</p>
<p>News from the Publishing Industry: The "Shuang Shuang Hu Die" (Paired Butterflies) songbook is the most popular song of modern times. All girls' schools have adopted it as a textbook. The Bei Kai Company has specially produced it into a record that is very popular. The songbook is sold for only two jiao. The Wenming Dadong Bookstore and the Hudie Song and Dance Club in Jiu'an Lane, Huangjiaque Road, also have collections for sale.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the 12th, I arrived at Penang Island. The mountain I saw resembled the Lion Mountain in Nanjing and the Gold Mountain, unlike the flat hills of Singapore. Upon landing, I met the secretary of the former Tang Dynasty consul to Penang, Pei Yuan (courtesy name Shuyuan), who has a family reputation for calligraphy and painting and is currently running a Ya Nan Normal School. Upon arriving in Penang, I stayed at the Guanyin Temple on Cheshui Street. The temple monk, Master Baoling, treated me very kindly. That evening, Dr. Xu Xiaoshan invited guests such as Dai Zhiting and Dai Peiyuan to a banquet at the foot of Kek Lok Si Temple. The scenery of Kek Lok Si is similar to the Western Hills of Beijing. We sat until 8 pm, and it already felt cool, unlike the heat of Singapore. The climate here is cooler and fresher. Doctor Xu is skilled in poetry and medicine and earns a thousand yuan per month.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 13th, I visited the Guanyin Pavilion and the Guangtong Master. The master is the honorary president of the Buddhist Studies Society. I was invited to dinner there. After dinner, I visited the research society, which had about a hundred male and female members who were worshiping, similar to the Japanese walking barefoot around the courtyard chanting Buddhist scriptures. I discussed Buddhism with the president, Mr. Li, and Mr. Yang in English. Generally speaking, the Nanyang region practices Theravada Buddhism. I received a letter from my friend Da Xiyin in Siam, who said that people who practice Theravada Buddhism have fewer desires and are content, so unrest does not arise. This is especially true of those who have become monks. If Theravada Buddhism becomes widespread, it may also put an end to human strife and killing.</p>
<p>On the 15th, Mr. Dai Shuyuan visited and invited me to the seaside to watch men and women swimming. Western women swim in the sea with men. Their physiques are truly strong and active. Ancient Chinese books also discussed women bathing. For example, the "Book of Songs" states that "Heaven commanded the dark bird to descend and give birth to Shang." There was a woman named E'e who was about to have a child. The "Historical Records" say that Yin Qi's mother, Jian Di, was the daughter of the E'e clan. Three women were bathing when they saw a dark bird's egg and swallowed it, giving birth to Qi. The "Qing Donghua Records" say that the ancestor of the Aisin Gioro clan also swallowed a bird's egg while his grandmother was bathing. These are all imitations of Chinese books that are attributed to divine events. However, in fact, the women of the three northeastern provinces still bathe in the river to this day. In Guangdong and Guangxi, I have seen many female boatmen, some as young as seven or eight, learning to swim in the river. North of the Huai River and within the Great Wall, almost no women can bathe in the river. On the other hand, the ancient Roman education system had women learning to swim. This shows what their customs were like. Today, at the narrowest point of the cape between England and France, called the Dover Strait, no man can swim across. However, a certain woman has swum across the cape, proving that the physical fitness of women in modern times is improving and they have the ability to surpass men. Also, recently, a 21-year-old British woman flew a plane to Nanyang, saying she would make a 12,000-mile flight.</p>

<p>— Wu Xiaohou</p>
<p>South of the concert hall is a large sports ground, about 7,000 tsubo in size, equipped for various large gatherings. Along the west side of the ground is the Rhododendron Hill, about 1,000 tsubo in size. This is where the landscaping began. It is the Rhododendron Garden of Okubo. It is evenly planted with autumn grass and Kerria japonica, among other things. Several elegant walking paths and a pavilion on a small hill make this one of the most refined parts of the park. To the west of the Rhododendron Garden is a Western-style cloud-shaped pond with an azalea facing the pond. From the front, there is a crane fountain. There are elegant bridges and wisteria trellises over the moat. Nearby are many exotic flowers, rare herbs, and ancient trees, creating scenes that never fade throughout the four seasons. From a positional point of view, it is located in the center of the garden and is constantly visited by people walking with canes. The northeast area of the concert hall, the area from the main gate through the music gate to the tower gate, is often used by the public. In the center of this area is a Western-style flower bed of about 1,000 tsubo, planted with various Western flowers and plants, including mixed flower beds or plantings of Liatris spicata and Stachys byzantina, with red flowers and purple herbs competing for glory in all seasons. To the southeast of the flower bed is the old Hibi Valley moat and stone ramparts, intended to preserve the old Japanese garden. There is a wild crane raised on the Horai Island in the pond, and other ponds are stocked with ducks, geese, mandarin ducks, and other waterfowl that lazily play and sleep among the lotus and reeds. The stone ramparts are the most desolate place in the garden and also a great place for viewing. To the northwest of the flower bed is a place for planting flowers and trees, as well as sample trees. The northwest area of the garden, from the Sakura Gate to the Kasumi Gate, has a grassland of 4,000 tsubo. In the center are three tennis courts. On the north side are three hills 75.3 meters high, inside which are a bird-feeding ground, a youth sports ground, a children's playground, and animal houses. The southwest corner of the garden, from the Kasumi Gate to the Saiwai Gate, has a forest of various trees. Recently, a large outdoor theater and a new concert hall for Western and Eastern music have been built inside. In addition to music, this place provides other public entertainment and is also planned for use for social education. There are more than 3,200 seats and it can accommodate 5,000 people. To the south of this forest area, the small triangular area from Saiwai Gate to the Saiwai Gate is planted with various trees, creating a very beautiful forest. There is a library inside. In the garden, the Matsumoto Building, the Mitsuhashi Pavilion, the Kirin Pavilion, and the Takayanagi Pavilion, among other tea and coffee shops, provide places to rest.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Gold and Finance Markets Resume Lower Trend <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The official gold price fluctuated throughout the day. Yesterday, the official gold price resumed a downward trend, but the situation was varied, with advances and retreats being inconsistent. There were swings of five taels in both the early and late markets, making it difficult to predict. This was due to the sudden drop in the swap trend. The bullish Fuchang Hengxing, and others privately swapped out in advance, initially at 5.56 qian per tael, and then pushed down to 3.56 qian per tael (multiple parties subsidizing the difference). However, the regulations of the exchange state that swapping is not allowed before the 16th of each month, so it was prevented by the authorities of the exchange. However, there was a deep intention behind the sudden willingness of the bullish parties to swap out. Were they suppressing the small market price and then manipulating it higher? As a result, many small retail bulls sold out, and there were quite a few bears who increased their positions. However, the market was chaotic and people were panicked. Foreign exchange was slightly relaxed. Each firm in the market was buying and selling differently. Fuchang, Wanxing, Shunli, and others were buying, while Taikang, Runyuan, Maoyong, Yuansheng, Xinxing, and others were selling. From the early market, there was a trend of withering and weakening, and it continued to weaken, falling to within 51 taels. Afterward, seeing the strength of the buying, it turned mild. It rose by three taels. In the late market, it went from weak to strong. Each firm sold and then bought back, once rising to 56 taels. However, due to the instability of people's hearts, it fell again by two taels.</p>
<p>The opening in the morning fell by 1.3 qian. The opening for the October contract was 555.3 taels, a fall of 1.3 qian. This was due to the slightly lower big bar price and the smaller silver price of 0.0625 and 0.375. However, the sellers were brave and unmoved. The raw market plunged by more than four taels, to only 50.078 taels. English gold was also strong. Sanlin sold October at 7 pence, 8125. Maihang absorbed December at 8 pence. After the pre-order was announced, it did not change at about 51 taels. It then fell from 1.5 taels to 50.05 taels. After a while, it went up, reaching 53.23 taels. After 10 o'clock, it returned to 2.3 qian. Afterward, Mitsui bought December English gold at 7 pence, 9375. November at 875. Fuchang and Wupin, among others, dropped their positions and bought, causing a calm rise of two taels. At 11:11, it rose to 54 taels. After a while, there was a difference of more than one tael. There was a difference in buying and selling. The market closed at noon at 53.1 taels. The announced price was still calculated at 603 taels. It was estimated to be a little less than 51 taels. Afterward, the afternoon price was 49 taels, and the closing price was 50 taels.</p>
<p>The closing price in the evening fell by 1.9 qian. The market opened in the afternoon at 53 taels and then trended lower. There was a slight rebound of only a few qian. I heard that the Indian exchange rate had been extended by two or three ounces, causing people's hearts to be empty. At 2:45, it fell to 50.06 taels. After entering, the buyers gradually entered the market. Yuanmao, Yongfuchang, and other small retail shorts had to chase to cover their positions. As for the drafts, they were still stable. Citi Hua Shang Bank absorbed 40.0125 yuan in the next month. December English gold at 7 pence, 9375. The price has been pulled up by more than two taels. After 3:30, I suddenly heard that the exchange rate had risen, so the market atmosphere became more intense, jumping three taels. After 4 o'clock, it reached 56 taels. However, the sellers did not slack off, so it was difficult to maintain. It suddenly fell by two taels, and the gap was four taels. At the 4:30 closing price, it was 54.7 qian, a fall of 1.9 qian compared to last Saturday. Afterward, there was a fluctuation of more than one tael, causing people's hearts to be disordered and at a loss. The maximum price for the whole day was 56 taels, and the minimum price was 50.05 qian, a difference of 5.5 qian. The announced price was calculated at 52 taels to 48 taels. 9 taels. The registered price was 64 taels to 53 taels. The supplementary water was 64 taels in the afternoon and 66 taels in the afternoon. The opening price of Wupin in the morning was 55.3 qian. The closing price at noon was 3.4 qian. The closing price in the afternoon was 3 taels.</p>
<p>The trading volume of each firm was not large. Fuchang, Shunli, Wanxing, Yuancheng, Yongcheng, Fengyong, Taifengcheng, and hedge funds all bought. Yuancheng, Taikang, Runxinxing, Yiyu, Yuanmao, Yongyongcheng, Changsheng, Dayu, Dacui, Tai, etc., all sold. Zhifeng, Yongda, Decheng, Yuantai, Futai, Hengkun, Heyuanxing, Yongshen, Changyong, etc., had inconsistent incomings and outgoings. In the afternoon, Yuanmao, Yonghengxing, Yuda, etc., sometimes went in and sometimes went out. Fuchang, Wanxing, and retail investors all went in. Hengxing, Cuitai, etc., sold out. The Dalian gang absorbed more than 1,000 contracts and sold 500-600 contracts. The Guangdong gang were just wearing hats and sometimes acting as agents and trading, so incomings and outgoings were inconsistent.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the HSBC exchange rates were the same as last Saturday. However, overseas silver markets saw a decline in the electrical news the day before. However, the market conditions were flat. The Chinese side advanced and then retreated. The exchange rates between the UK and the US both rose. The rates between Japan and the US did not change. The trends of the Shanghai, UK, US, and Japanese exchange rates were still flat, but slightly downward. The sudden drop in the official gold price was due to the sudden drop in the swap rate. However, the market conditions were chaotic and at a loss. It once fell to 50 taels and then pulled up by three or four taels. There were 5.5 taels of up and down throughout the day. Huashang slightly sold out. The exchanges of the UK gold totaled more than 100,000 pounds. Banks such as Maijia, Li, Sumitomo, and Taiwan Mitsui all took in. Mitsubishi Taiwan slightly sold out.

<h3 id="e98">Foreign Silver Dollar Rises Straight to the Sky <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Market overview: Recently, the demand for foreign currency has not been very high, but the price of silver dollars has been rising steadily, with a direct ladder to the sky. The main reason for this is that the banks in this street are preparing to reserve cash funds, so the momentum is slow and not as crazy as when the stomach is greatly暢. However, although the trend is firm, the slow rise is still quite alarming over time. The recent highs are not usually seen. If this continues, the market price may continue to rise.</p>
<p>Price of silver dollar conversion (foreign silver dollar): The early market price was 7 qian, 3 fen, 03 hao, 7 hu, and a half, which was 1 hao, 2 hu, and a half better than the previous day. The noon market rose another 2 hao, 5, to 7 qian, 3 fen, 06 hao, 2 hu, and a half, which was 2 li higher than the market price on Monday of last week (silver conversion): The early market and the noon market both opened at 5 fen, which was slightly smaller than the previous day. The markup was 7-8 fen, because the banks had more complicated collections and disbursements.</p>
<p>Currency market: Jiangnan small silver dollars were generally stable. The early market was still 6 qian, 4 fen, 7 li, and the noon market was slightly smaller, 2 hao and a half, for 6 qian, 4 fen, 6 li, 7 hao and a half. Transactions were made for 5,000 jiao in the early market and 3,000 jiao in the noon market. However, Guangdong small silver dollars continued to rise. The early market was 6 qian, 3 fen, 5 li, and the noon market was 6 qian, 3 fen, 6 li, a half. The result was 1 li and a half better than the most expensive price the previous day. Transactions were made for 155,000 jiao in the early market and 140,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper yuan rose another 1,000 to 389,000 wen.</p>
<p>Inflow and outflow of silver (silver currency): Yesterday, banks opened and closed a lot. Chinese banks received and paid out more than 3.2 million in paper currency, foreign banks received and paid out more than 2.56 million, special funds received and paid out more than 1 million, settlements were more than 2 million, and various goods, exchange rates, taxes, miscellaneous items, and mortgages, etc. received and paid out more than 11 million. 1.3 million were stored in warehouses. Japanese banks received and paid out 4.3 million in various funds, and 500,000 were released from warehouses. Qianzhuang and public silver houses received and paid out more than 43 million in total. Due to the higher value compared to the period, it seems that more markups were paid out. Various road exchange houses received and paid out 1.3 million and settled cash. (Foreign currency): Foreign drafts were issued for 1.495 million in the early market and 1.025 million in the noon market. Only 35,000 banknotes were issued in the noon market. 55,000 new coins were issued in the early market. 155,000 banknotes were issued off-site in the early market and 120,000 new coins were issued in the noon market.

<p>Investigation of Silver and Foreign Currency Reserves in Shanghai</p>
<h3 id="e99">Silver 107.04 Million Taels, Foreign Currency 148.24 Million Big Bars 2728 Bars <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>This year, the financial situation in Shanghai has been affected by cheap silver, and there has been no opportunity for a turnaround for a long time. As a result of the current silver flooding, the government has banned imports, but this has ultimately failed to restore the original state of the market. Instead, the mint is now opening its furnaces to cast coins, resulting in a shortage of raw materials. An investigation of the reserves in Shanghai in the first half of the year shows that the big bar reserves were always at 6-7,000. The Chinese banks have less than 400, while the 2,000+ are in the vaults of foreign banks. Although the current silver reserves are relatively large, they actually supply the demand for the market to circulate and for the mint to use as raw materials. The foreign currency reserves are mostly banknote reserves for the various banks, and the amount circulating on the market is purely negligible, and I do not expect the residual amount to be so small either (48 million yuan). Here is a detailed list of the deposit amounts in the warehouses of the various banks and qianzhuang (units of silver and foreign currency: 10,000; units of big bars: bars)</p>

<p>Yesterday, although there were many types of spot bonds on the market, the number of transactions was still small. The futures market continued to be flat. The atmosphere in the market was quite scattered. The changes in the bond prices showed that selling was dominant when the market opened in the morning. The prices were slightly lower than at the end of last week. However, the supply and demand became equal, and the prices hovered back up. In the late market, the prices were slightly sluggish. The prices of all bonds were settled and there were few changes. Because the situation was stable and there was no change in the surrounding bond market, there were no large transactions by the major players. The total transaction volume for spot bonds for the entire day was 17,400 yuan, and the total transaction volume for futures was 8.97 million yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market experienced a morning drop followed by an afternoon rise, but the overall situation remains unfavorable. This is because the existing stock is too substantial and sales are sluggish. Therefore, sellers are maintaining a calm attitude. Additionally, the global economic situation is weak, leading to softened sentiment. However, certain manufacturers remain bullish and continue to increase their holdings, purchasing at the limit price of 9 liang for this month. Fundamentally, raising prices may halt spot sales and lead to inventory accumulation, making it difficult to reduce stock. Thus, with weak demand, the future outlook is not optimistic. It is feared that the current yarn market price may experience a significant drop, as it is too high compared to future yarn prices. Recent daily declines in Japanese yarn prices are said to be gaining momentum.</p>
<p>The Raw Cotton Market: Morning Decline, Afternoon Stability. The raw cotton market opened in the morning with a negative environment, characterized by bleak American cotton and news that a raw cotton merchant from Wuhu had closed his 6,000-piece contract with great pain due to margin call issues. Market sentiment eased further, with prices for each month falling by 0.012 to 0.023 taels. In the afternoon, the old bullish investors from Hengda Factory bought heavily at the limit price of 9 taels in September, stirring the market and causing slight gains in prices for each month, ranging from 0.011 to 0.069 taels. The total trading volume for the day was 28,350 bales. Sales included 2,400 bales of Hanfeng, 1,400 bales of Yongchang, 1,650 bales of Xincheng, 1,200 bales of Lichang, 1,005 bales of Shenxin, 950 bales of Tianchang, and 400 to 600 bales of others. Purchases included 1,150 bales of Da Ji, 1,150 bales of Yuantai, 1,500 bales of Yikang, 900 bales of Heshen, 950 bales of Shen Ji, 800 bales of Yongfeng, and 400 to 700 bales of others. The closing prices of the raw cotton market are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Closing Prices: Increase/Decrease, Account Balance. September: 14.95, down 0.04, 174,500. October: 14.84, down 0.04, 179,500. November: 14.84, down 0.04, 111,500.

<p>The cotton market was lifeless this morning due to the bleak situation in American cotton, stagnant actual demand, weak sentiment, and the decline in the yarn market, leading most factories to refrain from purchasing. However, domestic merchants, noting the poor harvests in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, bought a significant amount of cotton. Additionally, hand-to-mouth buyers also purchased 20,000 dan. It is said that some, seeing the unfavorable overall situation, have already exited the market. If domestic merchants and hand-to-mouth buyers start to sell off, there may be another significant drop in the market. How the raw cotton merchant faction will proceed depends on demand and weather conditions.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Market Slightly Better in the Afternoon. The raw cotton market opened in the morning in a rather panicked state. As foreign cotton was not selling, retail investors sold off, causing drops of 0.035 to 0.04 taels across the board. In the afternoon, with a slight rise in the yarn market and unfavorable weather, retail investors bought in, causing a rebound of 0.015 to 0.02 taels across all months. Total trading volume for the day was 53,300 dan. Sales included 3,000 dan of Lichang, 1,900 dan of Yukang, 1,000 dan of Yongfeng, 1,100 dan of Shenyu, 1,400 dan of Tianchang, and 1,100 to 1,400 dan of others. Purchases included 2,400 dan of Jinfeng, 4,100 dan of Tianlong, 2,100 dan of Zhenda, and 1,400 to 1,200 dan of others. The closing prices of the raw cotton market are recorded on the left.</p>

January: 32.60, unchanged, 510,100. February: 32.65, unchanged, 543,600. Current Cotton Sales Virtually Non-Existent: Current cotton business is practically non-existent. Factories have no intention of purchasing due to the low price of foreign cotton. Moreover, both domestic and foreign factories have sufficient Indian cotton for their needs, estimated at 1,300 bales of Yao flower cotton and 700 bales of Tong flower cotton.</p>
<p>3,100 bales of Rangoon cotton were purchased by Shenxin Factory and sent to the factory immediately. 2,000 bales of Yao flower cotton, priced at 3.30 to 3.2, were purchased by raw cotton traders for spot delivery.</p>

<p>Yesterday in Zhabei, the source of various arrivals varied in quantity, and sales were also mixed between brisk and sluggish. Broken white rice was scarce and sales were robust, leading to a firm market. Premium grades opened at 20.075 yuan. Arrivals of West New Japonica were strong, estimated at over 300 shi, with higher grades at 20.0 yuan and lower grades at 19.5 yuan. East New Japonica arrivals were scarce, and factory stocks were gradually depleting, leading merchants to hoard goods, causing a price increase of 0.5 yuan. The high opening price was 20.0 yuan. New Yangjian rice fell by about 0.2 yuan. Arrivals of rice from inland areas at the wharf saw weak buying interest, and the market opened at only 14.8 yuan. New Kejian rice was also weak, falling by about 0.2-0.3 yuan. Rice from various areas along the Yangtze River in Southern Anhui and Eastern Jiangxi continued to arrive in Shanghai, leading to a continued weakening of the market by about 0.2-0.3 yuan. Arrivals of White Yuan rice were also limited, and sales in the local market were relatively brisk, thus the market presented a stable appearance. Top grades once again approached the 19 yuan level.</p>
<p>Supplies from the Shanghai South River were scarce from only a few dealers, and market activity was extremely calm. Sources of broken inland japonica rice were very limited, causing sellers to pressure sales and hindering trading activity, leading to a slightly firm market. The trend for Southern paddy rice was also stable, with high-priced goods at 21 yuan, but these were all small-scale transactions. The market for East New Japonica rice reported shortages, leading to few transactions. A small amount of Yangjian rice arrived in Shanghai, but sales were not brisk, with high-priced goods selling at around 14 yuan, slightly weaker by about 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Notice: The price evaluation association established by the Northern City Social Bureau will only be dissolved after rice prices on all markets reach 10 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Flour Market's Recent Steepest Decline <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the market for all months showed a consistent downward trend, especially for the current month. This is because the bulls in the current month mostly relied on the manufacturers' intentions. Now it is known that although the manufacturers' buy orders have been gradually removed by the raw cotton traders by 300,000 to 400,000 bales, it is rumored that a certain factory, feeling that the environment is unfavorable, intends to completely abandon the buy orders that were scheduled to be removed. Therefore, the opening price immediately fell. Subsequently, outside speculators, having lost their support, also aggressively sold out their positions, so the lowest price once fell to 2.04475 taels, a sharp drop of 0.055 taels compared to the previous week's closing price. October fell to 1.041 taels, and the other months also fell by 0.02-0.03 taels. By the second session in the afternoon, rumors spread that spot purchases could be made again this month, so sentiment slightly recovered and distant months also showed slight improvement. However, if the price of foreign wheat remains low, the outlook is still uncertain. As a result, the current month fell by 0.0375 taels, October fell by 0.0325 taels, November fell by 0.0175 taels, December fell by 0.02 taels, January fell by 0.0125 taels, and February fell by 0.01 tael.</p>

<p>Foreign Wheat Continues to Fall, Bulls Exit</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the plunge in all months was even more chaotic and reached its extreme. The price of foreign wheat continued to fall by about 0.3-0.4 yuan. The bullish raw cotton merchants, since the manufacturers had already sold foreign wheat, would naturally reject domestic wheat even more in the future, so the raw cotton traders' sell-off was extremely robust. Temporary speculative shorts also continuously pressured the market, so the lowest price for September, October, and November fell by a huge 0.11-0.12 taels compared to the previous week. Distant months generally fell by 0.07-0.08 taels. However, between the second and third sessions, manufacturers covering their shorts competed to cover their positions, causing a rebound of 0.04-0.05 taels for near months, and a slight rebound for distant months. As a result, September fell by 0.06 taels compared to the previous week, October fell by 0.07 taels, November fell by 0.06 taels, and December to February fell by 0.04 taels. Spot Wheat Market: As benchmark prices have plummeted, factories are even less interested in inquiring about prices.</p>
<h3 id="e108">North-South Goods: New Quanzhou Bullets and Rounds Opened Yesterday <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Top-Grade Prices at 30 Taels; Lower Grades Extremely Cheap</p>
<p>The first batch of over 3,000 boxes of Quanzhou Bullets and Rounds arrived recently on the Huaheng Wheel. Due to the late arrival in Shanghai, it coincided with the time when Tong'an Rounds prices were at their lowest. Moreover, the goods were newly arrived, and most were damp and soft and could not be stored for long. With nothing to defend and no price to report, the dealers had no choice but to sell at market prices, leading to extremely chaotic market prices. Yesterday, the entire batch was sold. Top-grade goods opened at 30 taels, with subsequent grades cheaper by 1-2 taels, down to 2-3 taels. Middle-grade goods were priced at 22-23 taels down to 20 taels, and the lowest grade was not above 10 taels. The cheapness of the lower grades was unprecedented in recent years, as the trading floor was extremely sluggish.</p>

<p>Recently, the local cotton cloth market has been affected by the frequent drops in flower and yarn prices, coupled with sluggish actual sales, leading to a gradual decline. Yesterday, fine cloth was down by about 0.05 yuan, and gray cloth also softened. However, fine twill remains firm and selling strongly due to a lack of spot goods. Yesterday, transactions in the local market and by Ningbo and other guilds totaled over 100 pieces, with Yanghe selling for 7.25 taels, Blue Double Fish for 6.875 taels, Butterfly Ball for 6.725 taels, and 13-pound coarse cloth purchased by raw cotton traders for over 50 pieces, with Double Eagle selling for 5.95 taels, Horse Dog for 5.9 taels, and Double Horse for 5.85 taels. Fine cloth saw the sharpest decline in Blue Chicken, selling for 6.65 taels, and Blue Flying Fish also softened, selling for 7.15 taels yesterday.</p>
<p>The trend for Eastern and Western piece goods is softening, especially for Eastern goods, which have seen a steeper decline. This is largely because the previous price increases were too excessive, making it difficult for those in need to commit. Moreover, those holding goods, seeing the rising market prices, are all seeking to sell, leading to an oversupply. With actual sales stagnant, the market suddenly became depressed. Yesterday, Middle Flower Velvet was down by 0.025 to 0.05 yuan, Chicken Coop selling for 0.1975 yuan, White Peony for 0.195 yuan, Straight Tribute Satin down by 0.025 yuan, Flying Horse and Magpie Bridge Meeting both opening at 0.28 yuan, and Banana Leaf Title Book at 0.275 yuan. However, Fine Geji remains firm, with Treasure Ball at 0.31 yuan and Lakeside Pavilion at 0.27 yuan, likely due to a shortage of spot goods. Western goods saw no major changes, and Releasing Carp Straight Tribute Serge bucked the trend and opened at 0.245 yuan yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Mayes Steel Arrived Yesterday - 200 Tons <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>200 tons of Mayes steel arrived yesterday from New York. It is said that the cost of these goods is quite high, which has little impact on the Shanghai market. However, due to the cool weather, trading has picked up as various guilds have made purchases. Local factories have also been making small purchases. The current market price is 22.25 taels for old factory goods, estimated at 20.05 taels for new steel factory goods, and 19.75 taels for Mitsui goods.</p>

<p>Since the rebound in the pound sterling, the price of pig lead in the market has gradually decreased. Recently, it was estimated at 14.5 taels, down 0.035 taels compared to the previous market. Transactions are very slow as the arms factory is not purchasing.</p>

He returned to Shanghai by the Changchun Maru at 3 PM on the 14th. He went to the Central Bank's Ministry of Finance office yesterday morning to work. This reporter made a special trip to meet him. According to Mr. Song, he was quite satisfied with this trip to Shandong to inspect the financial and tax revenue situation. The income from national taxes such as tobacco and alcohol was quite abundant. When the Jin army was defeated, it was very hasty, so only 300,000 yuan was raised locally from the banking community in Jinan. Other taxes were not transferred at all. Now that Shandong's tax revenue has been sorted out, it should be even more considerable. When he passed through Qingdao, he met with Mayor Hu Ruoyu, but he did not discuss political issues. When asked about the abolition of likin and the new import tariff rules, Mr. Song said that the Ministry of Finance had made thorough preparations for the abolition of likin, and the provinces also had detailed reports to the Ministry. However, due to the war, it was slightly difficult. The Ministry of Finance hopes to implement it as scheduled on Double Ten Day, but if it is absolutely necessary, it can only be postponed slightly. As for the national new tariff rules, the Ministry of Finance has submitted them to the Legislative Yuan, which has been sent to the Finance Committee for review. It is expected that the new tariff rules will be announced before National Day. The new tariff rules and the abolition of likin cannot be discussed together. Whether or not the abolition of likin is implemented has no relationship to the implementation of the new tariff rules. In short, if the military situation ends early, there will definitely be a solution to the financial situation, etc.</p>

<p>Jiujiang Aircraft Test Flight to Yichang</p>
<p>Suddenly Returned to Hankou Yesterday</p>
<p>The China Aviation Corporation is preparing for the official flight from Shanghai to Hankou, extending to the Chongqing line, at the beginning of next month. Last Friday, the chief and deputy directors of the company's air navigation team, Smith and Nie Kaiyi, flew the Jiujiang aircraft for a test flight to Chongqing, as reported in detail in previous newspapers. According to the original plan, the Jiujiang aircraft could have arrived in Chongqing yesterday. However, according to a telegram received by the local aviation company from Hankou yesterday, the Jiujiang test flight had safely arrived in Yichang the day before and stayed overnight. They were just about to continue flying to Wanxian and Chongqing, when they suddenly received a radio message from a private source in Chongqing stating that Liu Xiang's side had not yet received a formal telegram informing them of the test flight to Chongqing, and that the local authorities there had not been properly contacted, so a rash flight might cause misunderstandings. Nie Kaiyi and others then decided to fly the original aircraft back to Hankou from Yichang for the time being and then decide whether to advance or retreat. According to the telegram obtained by the local aviation company, it was only known that the Jiujiang aircraft arrived in Hankou at 11 AM yesterday. As of 4 PM yesterday, there had been no further telegram reports from Hankou as to whether it would continue to fly back to Shanghai. According to what the aviation company knows, before the test flight, Nie Kaiyi had already telegraphed the Wuhan Commander-in-Chief and Sichuan Commander-in-Chief Liu, in his personal capacity, about the Shanghai-Chongqing air route. Liu had replied in support and said that the original Chongqing airfield could be borrowed. The reason for the setback in the middle of the flight may be that the telegram sent by the Ministry of Transportation to Chongqing had not yet been received, causing a misunderstanding. The local aviation company is now trying to contact Liu in Sichuan again, and will continue the test flight as soon as a satisfactory result is obtained. Whether the official opening of the Shanghai-Chongqing air route, originally scheduled for the beginning of next month, will be affected by this depends on the extent of the negotiations.</p>
<p>Execution of Jinliyuan Wharf Case Postponed Again</p>
<h3 id="e118">Director Li Consults with Staff for Days <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Jinliyuan Wharf case of the China Merchants Bureau, the Sandetang side has not yet received a reply from the Paris headquarters regarding the land price for the purchase of a portion of the wharf, and the deadline for reconciliation given by the French Public Concession last time has expired yesterday. Lawyer Gao Shuo and China Merchants Bureau Director Cai have sent letters to the French Consul General, the French Public Concession, and Sandetang, respectively, stating that the responsibility for the delay should be borne by the other party. It is reported that the French Consul General has expressed his willingness to allow Lawyer Gao Shuo, Deputy Director Liu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, to extend the deadline indefinitely. The local churches have been doing their best to mediate, and Father Xia Lou also agreed not to object further for the sake of promoting friendship between the two countries. It is hoped that a satisfactory solution can be reached through joint efforts.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency saw Deputy Director Liu Yunfang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs office. It was learned that Director Liu had met with Director Li yesterday afternoon. Director Li told Director Liu that the Jinliyuan Wharf case had been largely resolved through diplomatic means, which was gratifying. Regarding the purchase of a portion of the warehouses, only the land price needs to be determined, and there should be no other problems. Since he has just taken office, he is busy with various matters. He will ask Lawyer Gao to inquire about everything tomorrow (i.e., today). The reporter asked Director Liu how the case would proceed after the one-month extension (which expired on September 15) expired. Director Liu replied that he had already informed the French Consul in advance yesterday that the Chinese side could not be held responsible for the delay caused by the priests of Sandetang waiting for a reply from the French General Church, and that he should request a continued extension of the deadline to facilitate public judgment and negotiations. The French Consul had already agreed to this in person and stated this to Lawyer Gao yesterday.</p>
<p>The City is Actively Dividing the Urban Area</p>
<h3 id="e119">The Number of Sections in Densely Populated Areas Will Be Doubled <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The City Government has specially established a committee to actively carry out the division of urban areas in the city. A few days ago, the committee convened its first meeting to discuss all the issues related to the division of districts in detail. It was noted that the Zhabei and Hunan districts of the city, and the areas adjacent to Zhabei and Hunan, have a large population and a high density of households. In many cases, seven or eight households live in one house, and even one room is divided into several parts to accommodate several families. The crowded conditions are very special. If the regulations of the City Organization Law are followed, with five households as the limit for a neighborhood, and the number of households in the city is calculated as a whole, then the city can be divided into seventy or eighty districts. At a time when the city treasury is in deficit, administrative expenses are already insufficient. In the future, the division into a large number of districts and neighborhoods may hinder municipal facilities, and the city treasury will be unable to cope. It was decided that all of the Southern City and Zhabei, as well as the areas of the Pusong, Fahua, Pengpu, and Wusong districts adjacent to the Southern City and Zhabei, have special circumstances, and it is proposed to double the number of five households per neighborhood in accordance with the special circumstances stipulated in Article 5 of the City Organization Law. It is said that this has been submitted to the City Government for referral to the Ministry of Interior for verification and record.</p>
<p>Water Price Case in the Concession</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Real Estate Association Sends a Letter Requesting the Cancellation of the Approval <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association sent a letter to the Public Works Department on the 12th, requesting the cancellation of the water price increase case of the Water Company. The original letter is translated below: Respectfully, our association sent a serious protest to the Shanghai Water Company on the 9th of this month, opposing the increase in surcharges, stating that the company's increase in water prices is not allowed, whether in principle or as a temporary expedient. If it is implemented, it will be contrary to the contract signed by your bureau and the company in 1928. Within the time period of the price rate, the provisions of the price shall not be arbitrarily changed. I hope that you will understand the principles of municipal administration in the newspaper, and that all public utilities with natural monopoly properties must be owned by the public. If they are run by private companies, the public must impose proper sanctions. If there is a lack of sanctions, private companies often seek to profit and damage the public interest. The local authorities must provide absolute protection to the interests of individual users and the entire society to prevent the company from being eroded by greed for profit. The only reason the company proposed to increase prices this time is that the exchange rate has plummeted and prices have risen, resulting in a loss of net profit this year and insufficient payment of regular dividends. On this point, our association has the following questions to ask: (1) What is the amount of the so-called insufficient dividend payment? (2) According to the contract, when dividends are insufficient, the savings from the average dividend account must be used to pay. Has the company followed this provision? (3) The current exchange rate has gradually rebounded. Has the company announced that the insufficient dividend payment due to the plummeting exchange rate has been reduced due to the increase in the exchange rate? (4) Is there a provision in the contract that regular dividends must be paid annually at a maximum fixed rate? (5) The price rate period stipulated in the contract is five years. Why did the company request a revision of the price only five years after the contract was signed? Our association does not know whether the company has explained the above questions to your bureau, but it is kept secret from the residents. Now that the company wants to compensate for its losses by increasing prices for the residents, the residents should know the company's current economic situation and the truth about the price increase. It is proposed that your bureau conduct a thorough investigation of all the company's files and accounts in accordance with the special rights granted by Article 23 of the contract, so that the residents can be informed of the company's economic content, so as to await a fair and impartial judgment from the society. At present, please reconsider the price increase proposal, revoke the previous approval, and conduct a revision when the current price rate period expires, taking the interests of all residents as the premise. Any requirements of the company must be approved by the residents. I can't help but look forward to it. Correspondingly, I hope you will check and take care of it.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Tenants in Qingyun Lane Held a Large Petition</p>
<h3 id="e121">Hua Dong Yuan Lüdun is Currently Mediating <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the tenants' union of Qingyun Lane in Hongkou made a large-scale petition to various institutions. Over 300 evicted tenants participated, and Tang Huilian, Zhou Gan Chen, Gao Jieyuan, and Jiang Xianhe were elected as chief representatives. They prepared a written statement and traveled in five large automobiles. First, they drove to the Fourth District Party Headquarters, where they were received by Committee Member Shen. He agreed to forward their request to higher authorities and strongly advocate for a satisfactory resolution. After a 20-minute discussion, they departed and drove to the Shanghai Special District Court. They were received by Judge Chen, who expressed concern. He stated that the court had read the news reports after the incident and would legally protect the rights of the representatives. The court would not condone any disturbance of the peace. They then drove to the Municipal Party Headquarters, where Comrade Huang Xianggu met with them and stated that the party's principles were to protect the safety and security of the citizens. Regardless of the country of origin, if people use barbaric means to oppress us, the government should be responsible for negotiating and protecting our citizens. The Chinese government values humanity and temporarily allows people to stay to make a living. Unexpectedly, these White Russians dared to be ungrateful and assist in oppressing their hosts, which is unjustifiable. He promised to deal with them severely and instructed the representatives to comfort the petitioning tenants, assuring them to live and work in peace while awaiting a resolution. After a 30-minute discussion, the representatives happily withdrew. They then drove to the Municipal Government, where Committee Member Zhang showed great concern for the people's suffering. He instructed the representatives to comfort the petitioning tenants and not to be misled by rumors, assuring them to wait patiently for a solution. He emphasized that the spirit of public unity must adhere to the regulations on public training to comply with the legal system and not overstep boundaries. As for the landlord's illegal actions that have caused the Chinese people to suffer such humiliation, the government would provide adequate protection and countermeasures to achieve a satisfactory resolution. The discussion was detailed and passionate, lasting about 30 minutes. The representatives expressed their gratitude and took their leave. They then went to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but Director Chen was not present. They handed the petition to the transmission office to be forwarded on their behalf. Finally, they drove back to the Public Concession Bureau to see General Manager Edward, but he had already finished work for the day, so they did not meet. The representatives then led all the tenants back to the association headquarters, arriving at 6:00 PM. The text of the petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>To: Mayor Zhang of the Shanghai Municipal Government, Director Chen of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, President Yang of the Shanghai Special District Court, the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, the Fourth District Party Headquarters, and General Manager Edward of the Shanghai Public Concession Bureau.</p>
<p>We, the members of the association, are submitting this petition regarding the house owner, the British firm New Sassoon, employing White Russian gangsters to forcibly demolish our homes. We request your swift assistance to maintain security and order.</p>
<p>The houses rented by the members of the association from New Sassoon were renovated only 13 years ago and are still in good condition, with no need for reconstruction. However, the firm, greedy for profit, leased the properties to a certain large company and suddenly issued a notice at the end of June, demanding that we move out and hand over the houses by August 31st to facilitate construction. At a time of financial hardship and economic downturn, with dwindling wages and high prices, it is difficult for the members of the association to bear the heavy burden of relocation. Moreover, there are very few vacant houses in Shanghai, making it even harder to find alternative accommodation. Therefore, we have repeatedly written letters and sent representatives. Finally, we entrusted lawyer Chen Tingrui to write a letter, earnestly requesting them to reconsider. However, the firm, blinded by profit, showed no compassion. The members of the association were left with nowhere to turn and appealed for help. Fortunately, organizations such as the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association wrote to the Public Concession Bureau, requesting impartial handling, preventative measures, and a swift halt to the firm's illegal actions. They also issued an order to all police stations, forbidding them from sending officers to assist in the abuse and avoid causing trouble. We received a reply from the Public Concession Bureau stating that these disputes should be resolved by the court, and the police would only maintain order and enforce court orders. The firm, unable to achieve its goals, suddenly cut off the electricity to our neighborhood on September 1st, attempting to plunge the entire area into darkness. They also requested the water company to stop supplying water, aiming to starve the entire neighborhood into submission. Fortunately, the company, with a strong sense of justice, was not fooled. On September 10th, at 10:00 AM, they hired over 200 Russian gangsters, who swarmed in, destroying property and attacking people. They climbed onto the roofs and demolished houses arbitrarily. They also openly robbed and stole, preventing any resistance. The disorder was immediately reported to the police station, who sent officers to restore order. It is estimated that three people, Miao She-lai, Ye Cheng-lin, and Li A-chang, were injured, and daily necessities, money, and clothing were lost. Such illegal oppression and wanton destruction by the firm, with their inhumanity and disregard for the law, cannot be tolerated by justice and are universally condemned. Furthermore, the Russian gangsters are being used to disrupt the peace. If they are allowed to reside in Shanghai for an extended period, the local area will become increasingly dangerous. In addition to filing a lawsuit with the court to seek due punishment, we are submitting this petition to your government and departments, requesting that you take measures to expel the Russian gangsters, who pose a threat to the security of Shanghai, to protect local security. We also ask for appropriate assistance to protect the legal residential rights of the citizens. We would be eternally grateful.</p>
<p>Dama Evening News says that regarding the negotiation of house demolition in Qingyun Lane, Chongming Road, Hua Dong Yuan Lüdeng of the Public Concession Bureau, considering the seriousness of the situation, has voluntarily stepped forward to mediate. He has contacted the landlord Sassoon several times, and a concrete solution is expected this afternoon (the 15th). The houses in the lane remain in their original state, and the tenants' union posted a notice today advising all tenants to wait patiently for the outcome of the mediation.</p>
<p>Swedish Match Merchants Purchase Japanese Match Factory</p>
<h3 id="e122">Ministry of Industry and Commerce Convenes National Match Industry Conference <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Swedish matches are sold all over the world, and almost all match industries in various countries have been defeated. Chinese match merchants have also been affected by their competition and are barely surviving. Recently, Swedish merchants purchased the entire Japanese Sui-sei Match Factory. The Japanese Sui-sei Match Factory has its main factory in Japan and two factories in China, one on Gordon Road in Shanghai and one in Zhenjiang, both of which are quite large. The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Visiting Bureau will convene a meeting of the National Match United Association and major match merchants, including Mr. Liu Hongsheng, at 10:30 AM on the 17th of this month to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<p>Li Zhonggong Officially Takes Office Yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e123">Attends Memorial Week and Reports on Administrative Guidelines <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Li Zhonggong, the newly appointed General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, officially arrived at the company and began his duties yesterday. Yesterday morning, Mr. Li attended the company's Memorial Week ceremony and reported on the company's affairs. He stated that after the stabilization of the situation, whatever policy the government adopts towards the company will help its future development. He received a telegram from the Nanjing Telecommunications Reorganization Committee stating that it would be established this Friday, which will provide the company with a responsible reorganization mechanism and increase its strength to promote its future development. Although the list of committee members has not been announced, those appointed by the nation to the reorganization committee will definitely not be high-ranking officials merely in name. The most urgent task for the company is to deal with outstanding payments totaling around 1.6 million taels. He will be responsible for handling the company's affairs from today onwards and will need to raise funds to cover these payments. First, he will settle the outstanding payments from the previous administration of Mr. Zhao, then find ways to repay old and new debts. Once the committee decides on a direction, a fundamental reorganization plan will be developed. In his view, fundamental reorganization is not difficult, but dealing with the current situation is. His standards for personnel and administration are talent, appropriate management, scientific management, elimination of corruption, and integrity. He already stated at the inauguration ceremony that he is committed to integrity. During his three years of service in the Ministry of Communications, he did not take a single penny beyond his salary. Outsiders may view the company as a lucrative position, but he only knows to maintain integrity and will remain unwavering. He also hopes to work with his colleagues towards this goal. Some department heads from the previous administration of Mr. Zhao have firmly resigned. Because the work of the departments is important and cannot be left vacant for a day, others have been appointed to take over. Other employees who have served the company for a long time and have achieved considerable results can continue to serve with peace of mind. Foreign shipping companies employ very few people but are highly efficient because everyone does their best and takes responsibility. In the future, he will base rewards and punishments on the diligence of his colleagues. In short, the company's position is not that of an ordinary shipping company and is of great importance to both the industry and the country. From today onwards, he hopes that his colleagues will work for the party, the country, and the company with peace of mind. No matter what difficulties we encounter, we can overcome them. From today onwards, let us, along with the current situation, wish the company a prosperous future. Mr. Li appointed Yu Zhiming as secretary to handle confidential matters and entrusted him with the seal. Department Head Shen Zhongyi of the Shipping Department will temporarily take over. Staff member Cao Renze was appointed as Assistant of the Shipping Department.</p>
<p>General Manager Li of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Expresses His Views to the Employees of the Five Wharves</p>
<p>The employees' union of the Five Wharves of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, due to the fact that Mr. Li Zhonggong has now taken over, sent representatives to pay their respects yesterday and inquire about the reorganization plan, employee benefits, and unpaid wages. General Manager Li personally received them. The representative of the employees' union, Yu Xianting, spoke first, offering his congratulations and hoping that the comprador system would be completely reformed. General Manager Li then spoke briefly, stating that he had come to reorganize the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on a mission from the central government and would do so in accordance with the Three Principles of the People and the will of the central government. He can now say a few words that he hopes will be conveyed to all colleagues: (1) He expresses absolute sympathy for the employees' union. (2) He takes full responsibility for the employees' salaries, and unpaid wages will be paid as soon as possible, as this is what employees rely on to make a living. (3) Employee benefits will gradually improve. Finally, Yu said that the employees' union still had some outstanding cases with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which had been delayed due to the murder of General Manager Zhao and the temporary nature of Mr. Cai's position. Now that Mr. Li is the officially appointed General Manager by the central government, he hopes that all outstanding cases will be resolved as soon as possible. Li replied that he would resolve them in a short period of time after some reorganization and that he also hopes to meet with the responsible persons of the union from time to time to exchange opinions, in order to avoid misunderstandings and to fully understand the situation of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company.</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Xiong Sets a Deadline for Eradicating Lake Bandits</p>

All the water police and land and water military police in the four counties of Qingpu, Songjiang, Jinshan, and Pinghu will be under his command. If bandits flow into the counties of Wujiang, Fengxian, Shanghai, Jiaxing, Jiashan, and Nanhui, the Bandit Suppression Commander-in-Chief will dispatch the land and water public security teams to deal with them.

Reply Regarding催兑懋業鈔票 (Promoting the Exchange of Maoye Bank Notes)</p>
<h3 id="e124">First to Exchange One-Yuan Notes <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a reply to the Suzhou General Chamber of Commerce regarding the matter of promoting the exchange of Maoye Bank notes, stating:</p>
<p>"Dear Sirs, We received your letter stating that a significant number of Maoye Bank notes have been issued and urging us to promote their exchange. We forwarded your letter to the Shanghai Bankers' Association, which in turn forwarded it to the Maoye Bank Liquidation Office. According to the reply from the Liquidation Office, they have begun liquidation and will first exchange one-yuan notes. They intend to continue to handle the five-yuan and ten-yuan notes, but the number of five-yuan and ten-yuan notes issued is enormous, and the cash reserves are far short. Therefore, they can only rely on recovering the bank's debts. However, it is very difficult to collect the loans and overdrafts issued by the bank in a short period of time, and the current situation makes it even more difficult. They are currently trying to actively recover the bank's debts and will formulate an exchange plan and publish a notice in Chinese and foreign newspapers as soon as they have collected a certain amount. The Liquidation Office's responsibilities are inherent and need no urging. We have recorded the letter and replied accordingly. We hope that you will check and forward it to the Suzhou General Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3 id="e125">Explanation of Chamber of Commerce Organization Issues <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued the following explanations regarding chamber of commerce organization issues:</p>
<p>Method for Calculating the Increase of Representatives in Trade Associations</p>
<p>The Chamber replied to the Yuanning General Chamber of Commerce: "Dear Sirs, We received your letter of the 13th inquiring why the number of representatives nominated by trade associations in this city has not reached the maximum number stipulated by law, and requesting that we provide a list of the number of representatives nominated by each association, along with three types of formulas for calculating the method of nominating representatives for discussion. After investigation, very few trade associations in this city nominate the maximum number of representatives stipulated by law. This is not due to the undetermined number of employees in the shops belonging to the association, but because the membership fee must also be increased according to Article 48 of our chamber's regulations when the number of representatives is increased. In order to save money, most associations do not nominate the full number of representatives. Article 11 of the Chamber of Commerce Law stipulates that for every 15 additional people, one additional representative may be added. The wording of the law is arbitrary, and the association has the right to waive the right to nominate additional representatives. Our chamber cannot legally force them to nominate the full number of representatives. Therefore, there is no relationship with the calculation method. Regarding the calculation formulas listed in your letter, our chamber believes that this level still needs to be studied. The definition of 'more than fifteen people' in Article 11 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, according to our chamber's interpretation, refers to the total number of employees in the shops belonging to the association exceeding fifteen people during the most recent year's average use. The so-called 'for every 15 additional people' also means that for every 15 people from the sixteenth person onwards, in addition to the basic number of 15 people, one unit should be added, and one additional representative should be nominated. Therefore, according to the example in your letter, if the total number of employees in the shops belonging to a certain association is 210, one representative should be nominated for the basic number of 15 people. The remaining number is 195, which equals 13 units. Therefore, 13 additional representatives should be nominated, for a total of 14. The calculation method is the same regardless of whether there are seven or eight shops in the same industry. This is because, according to Article 8 of the Revised Implementation Rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law, the number of representatives of the association's members should be calculated comprehensively based on the number of employees in the shops belonging to the association. Therefore, the association is the main body, and there is no need to use the number of trade associations as the calculation standard. Whether this humble opinion is appropriate, we hope that you will make a decision early."</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Employees Do Not Include Apprentices or Workers</p>
<p>The chamber sent a letter to the Yagugi Industry Association: "Dear Sirs, We received your letter of the 13th asking whether the employees filled in the form refer to apprentices and workers in the store calculated together, or whether apprentices and workers are not included. After checking, Article 9 of the revised Implementation Rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law states that the term 'employees' in the preceding article is limited to managers, partners, and shop assistants who directly serve in the business. According to this standard, the workers in the store serve the business indirectly rather than directly, and therefore should not be included. We are sending this letter to inform you."</p>
<p>Two Types of Firms: Members and Representatives</p>
<p>The chamber sent a letter to the Silk and Satin Trade Association: "Dear Sirs, On the 13th of this month, we received Instruction No. 1746 from the Social Affairs Bureau regarding the case of Instruction No. 5607 from the Municipal Government approving the Department of Industry and Commerce's Consultation No. 12415 regarding the reply to the consultation regarding the inquiry from the City Silk and Satin Industry Reorganization Committee about whether restrictions should be imposed on the two types of firms: members and representatives. We have presented this case, which concerns the interpretation of laws and regulations, to the Executive Yuan to consult the Judicial Yuan for interpretation.

<p>Guangji Wheel Detained in Wenzhou</p>
<h3 id="e130">Due to the Discovery of a Batch of Military Supplies <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Since the Min bandits attacked Taishun and Pingyang, the local garrison in Wenzhou has been strictly guarding the waterways. Also, due to the bandit robbery of merchant ships last week, the Wenzhou garrison has formed a inspection fleet to inspect all merchant ships arriving in Wenzhou before they enter the port to prevent the mixing of communists and bandits. The city gates are closed at 9:00 PM at night, prohibiting passage.</p>
<p>Discovery of Military Supplies</p>
<p>The Wenzhou liner "Guangji" of the China Merchants Bureau loaded passengers and cargo in Shanghai on Friday of last week and sailed to Wenzhou. When the ship arrived at the Wenzhou wharf on Sunday, the inspection team of the local garrison boarded the ship and conducted a thorough search. In the hidden compartment under the platform on the second floor, they found a batch of illegally transported military supplies (the amount is unknown). The soldiers immediately transported the supplies back to the headquarters and began investigating the person responsible for the illegal transport.</p>
<p>Crew Member Flees</p>
<p>At the time of the discovery of the military supplies, the shipowner and others were unaware of the source of the supplies. They promised to investigate the person responsible for the illegal transport and remove the supplies from the "Guangji." Lin Funeng, the tally clerk of the "Guangji," suddenly fled, showing his guilt and attempting to evade responsibility.</p>
<p>Ship Detained</p>
<p>Local garrison officials were furious upon learning of Lin Funeng's disappearance. They considered the matter to be related to the illegal transport of military supplies and could not simply allow the ship to leave because one crew member had fled. They ordered the "Guangji" to be detained and demanded that the shipowner hand over Lin. Shipowner Tang negotiated with the army and requested permission to unload the cargo, as the goods of merchants would be delayed, in addition to assisting in the pursuit of Lin. However, the army had not yet agreed. Yesterday, shipowner Tang sent an urgent telegram to the Shanghai Bureau to report the situation and request negotiations. The bureau has reportedly telegraphed Wenzhou, first requesting that the cargo be unloaded and that the ship not be detained, and then promising to assist in the pursuit of the fugitive crew member. Detailed Report on Yongning Wheel Being Robbed</p>
<h3 id="e131">Four Escort Soldiers Killed <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper has already reported that merchant ships have been robbed by bandits in Wenzhou waters. After investigation by reporters from various sources, the details of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>Bandits Mixed Into Ship</p>
<p>The ship robbed was the "Yongning" wheel. This ship is a dedicated line between Ningbo and Wenzhou and is owned by the Yongning Company. Last week (ie, the 7th of this month), when the ship left Wenzhou to return to Ningbo, four bandits dressed as passengers had already mixed into the ship. The rest of the bandits were waiting along the way. When the ship arrived at Shitang, Wenzhou waters, the bandits on the ship waved their scarves to signal the large gang of pirates. More than a hundred pirates chased and boarded the ship from a sailboat, and the great robbery began.</p>
<p>Circumstances of Shitang Robbery</p>
<p>When the large gang of pirates swarmed onto the ship, they first occupied the captain's and driver's room. There were eight escort soldiers on the ship, four in uniform and four in plain clothes due to being off duty. Upon hearing the alarm, they each grabbed a gun to resist the bandits. Unexpectedly, they could not defeat the numerous bandits. The four soldiers in uniform were shot dead by the bandits at the time. The remaining four soldiers abandoned their weapons and fled into the boiler room, all of whom survived. At this point, the bandits began to rob the passengers and crew of their luggage, money, and belongings, all of which were looted.</p>
<p>Kidnapping More Than Thirty People</p>
<p>The purpose of the bandits' robbery of the ship was only one wealthy merchant from Wenzhou. When the robbery occurred, the wealthy merchant quickly took off his silk clothes and fled into the engine room, smearing his face with coal to pretend to be a stoker. The bandits searched everywhere but could not find him. They suspected that he had not boarded the ship and kidnapped more than thirty people from the passengers and crew with slightly more luggage, along with the stolen goods, and drove them onto the bandit boat.</p>
<p>Returning to Wenzhou After Robbery</p>
<p>The Yili wheel of this port, which returned to Shanghai from Wenzhou, passed through Shitang and saw that Yongning was still there. Yili suspected that Yongning had arrived in Ningbo and was returning to Wenzhou. At first, they did not expect to encounter bandits on the way and did not go to Ningbo. The shipowner of the Yongning wheel only re-hoisted the anchor after the bandits left. Instead of going to Ningbo, they turned back to Wenzhou and reported the incident to the customs officials in front of the Ouhai Customs. It is now heard that the Zhejiang Offshore Patrol Hall has sent a warship to pursue the missing kidnapped people. There has been no news of them so far. It is said that the loss of money and goods amounts to tens of thousands of yuan.</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Signs Contract to Ship Flour and Yarn</p>
<h3 id="e132">The Clearing and Transporting Business Association Actively Opposes <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The National News Agency says that the Clearing and Transporting Business Association held several meetings regarding the contract signed by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Fuxin, Maoxin, Shenxin and other factories to ship flour and cotton yarn. The Northern Clique also requested a meeting. At the meeting on the 13th, over 40 people attended. Commissioner You Senting reported on the negotiations with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The situation was not resolved. The representatives were all very angry and discussed among themselves that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's reduction of shipping costs was hindering the industry and cutting off their livelihoods. If other companies followed suit, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company would not benefit, and the industry would suffer greatly. They resolved to not stop until the contract was canceled. The discussion resulted in the following resolutions: (1) First, a written warning will be issued to urge them to realize their mistake and cancel the contract. Otherwise, a large meeting will be convened to decide on a unified response. (2) Regarding the shortage of goods with the Dalian Steamship Company, it was resolved to nominate Commissioner Zheng Renye to work with the Dalian Clique on the morning of the 18th to negotiate with the company in person.</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Mediates Another Sino-Japanese Labor Dispute Yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e133">Final Decision Today <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pudong Japan-China Cotton Mill labor dispute was previously [illegible] held by the City Party Department and the Public Security Bureau. All details were recorded in this newspaper at the time. Due to excessive disputes between labor and management, a resolution could not be reached immediately. Regarding worker treatment, the workers claimed that the mill's treatment was the lowest, while the Japanese side stated that the mill treated workers better than other factories. All mediation committee members believed it necessary to investigate, so they announced a second mediation session to be held on Monday (yesterday) morning. Representatives from the City Party Department were to investigate the treatment of workers in various Japanese-owned cotton mills in Shanghai. Yesterday marked the date of the second mediation session. The representatives from both sides in attendance were the Director of the Mediation Section of the City Social Affairs Bureau, Guo Yongxi, Zhang Yaoming from the City Party Department (later replaced by Mao Yun), Wang Guoxian from the City Public Security Bureau, recorder Wang Zhichin, and representatives from the management side, including the head of the Japan-China Mill, Yu Jingzheng, Sichun from the Japanese Cotton Mill Association, and Oikawa, the Personnel Section Chief of the Japan-China Mill. The labor representatives were Zhao Bi, Yu Qixiang, and others. After the formalities, the City Party Department representative reported on the investigation, stating that the treatment in Japanese-owned cotton mills under the same Japan-China capital was the same as in the Japan-China Mill. However, other factories, such as the Inland and External mills, were better than the Japan-China Mill and offered so-called contracted work bonuses and special bonuses in addition to the original wages. Director Guo then explained to the management side, stating that the Japan-China Mill workers held a general meeting yesterday and, after repeated persuasion, had already made concessions. The demand for wages during the strike period had been reduced from two months to two weeks. Regarding the increase in rice subsidies, they only requested that the factory provide each person with eight to ten yuan per month during the strike period until October, and that the original two fen night meal allowance not be canceled. He added that these concessions had reached their limit and urged them to give the matter careful consideration and resolve this point before continuing to discuss other issues. The management side still refused, firmly insisting on canceling the two fen night meal allowance and strongly opposing the wages for the two-week strike period, stating that they had to obey the chairman and could not rashly agree. Even when Director Guo showed them the record book quoting his own words, it had no effect. At the same time, the labor representatives also stated that they would not budge even a little from the agreed-upon scope. At that time, the situation was on the verge of collapse. Later, the Japanese side voluntarily took all the terms back for discussion and promised to return to the bureau at 10:00 am tomorrow (today) after the chairman's approval. Director Guo then drafted six points: (1) The Japan-China Cotton Mill workers' request to the Japanese side to increase rice subsidies will be temporarily suspended. Starting from September, the factory will issue each person a monthly bonus of eight yuan until October. (2) Each worker who completes half a month of day work must be rewarded with one and a half days' wages. Those who complete one week of day work and one week of night work will receive two days' wages plus two fen night allowance for each night. (3) Wages may not be issued directly when the stored work is insufficient. (4) The case of the factory dismissing workers Yu Qixiang and six others will be submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau by this committee to send personnel to investigate and verify. (5) The management will issue four days' wages to each person for the strike period. (6) If both parties can agree to sign the above points, work will be resumed at 9:00 am on Thursday (the 18th). All points were handed over to the labor and management sides for circulation. The management side immediately agreed to take them back for consultation. This mediation meeting can be said to have come to an end. If both parties cannot sign today, it will be a sign of a breakdown, and the Social Affairs Bureau will no longer hold mediation sessions and will submit a request to the City Government for arbitration. The Anglo-American factory went on strike.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Yesterday's Mediation a Success <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The old factory of the Shanghai Anglo-American Tobacco Company, the tin packaging workers, went on strike because the management dismissed worker Bao Yangzhou without reason. Last Saturday, the Party and government sides were prepared to go for mediation, but the head of the factory was out of town due to being late. Yesterday, Qiu Peihao from the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Jiaze from the City Party Department, and others rejoined with Chen Peide and Gu Ruofeng, the standing committee members of the labor union, to negotiate with the factory head, Gelandete, demanding that worker Bao Yangzhou be restored to his original job and that wages be paid as usual during the strike period. At that time, the head allowed Bao Yangzhou's work to be restored, but he had to be transferred to another room. If he was dissatisfied, he would be allowed to return to a suitable position after a week. Wages for one day of the strike period were acknowledged, calculated from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm. The representatives from both sides negotiated until their tongues were dry, but the head insisted on the original proposal. The representative from the Social Affairs Bureau and the representative declared that the matter would be discussed after the union convened a meeting of workers, and then negotiations would continue. The head agreed to wait at the factory for a reply and postponed his trip across the river by one hour. The union then convened a meeting of tin packaging factory workers at 4:00 pm, chaired by Chen Peide, who reported on everything and invited Qiu Peihao from the Social Affairs Bureau to attend and provide guidance. At that time, the workers felt that Bao Yangzhou's work had not been completely restored in accordance with the union's requirements, but they were satisfied. However, they insisted that the item of wages for only one day during the strike period must be fully paid. The representative from the Social Affairs Bureau immediately respected the union's wishes and returned to the factory to negotiate. It was not until about 6:00 pm that the head fully agreed, and the workers also decided to resume work today.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Death of Russian Child Lost at Sea <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>From the Mouth of a Companion Child</p>
<p>The Police Believe Drowning is Undoubted</p>
<p>His Mother Anxiously Awaits Her Son's Return</p>
<p>The Actions of the Small Boat Owner Are Highly Suspicious</p>
<p>Three days ago, this newspaper carried a news item about the fearless spirit of three Russian children, stating that eight-and-a-half-year-old Lukonsky served as first mate, and twelve-year-old Gravsky was the shipowner. The three children set off in a mighty manner. The ancients had the ambition to ride the long wind and break through thousands of miles of waves, and these young children were able to practice their lives of breaking through the wind and waves. Calling it a fearless spirit is truly accurate and unwavering. Therefore, this news item attracted the attention of readers after it was published. The incident occurred on the first of this month, and the next day, two children were sent home by the water patrol team. However, first mate Lukonsky was nowhere to be found, becoming a suspicious case. His mother, Mrs. Gardon, was very anxious. In addition to asking the police and various newspapers to search, she also sent telegrams to relatives and friends in other ports to pay attention. Yesterday, the reporter suddenly received a message stating that Lukonsky's disappearance involved the two Russian children who were traveling with him, and that Kang had already drowned. The reporter believed that there must be twists and turns inside the matter and that it was interesting, so he visited Lukonsky's mother, Mrs. Jia, at her residence on Mercer Road, and learned about the outline of the matter.</p>
<p>Drowned in Huangpu. The so-called first mate Lukonsky lives with his mother at No. 319 Mercer Road, French Concession. When the reporter first visited at around 8:00 pm, only lights were leaking from the windows on the floor, and it was quiet as if no one lived there. When he knocked on the door, he suddenly saw a small note on the lintel with the English words "Beware of dogs." The reporter became wary. However, after tapping for a long time, there was no sound, let alone the sound of dogs. The reporter was very frustrated and changed to the back door. Then, the Chinese characters "Beware of ferocious dogs" were written in white powder on the back door. The reporter was even more frightened. He thought that since the family kept many dogs and marked them as ferocious, then the little master's adventurous nature was probably not accidental. He wanted to knock on the door, but there was no response, so he had to return in disappointment. The second time he arrived at around 10:00 pm, the light from the building shone, and he could see the beautiful furnishings in the room. After entering the room, he met the hostess, Mrs. Jia, who looked sad and worried. However, two puppies jumped in front of and behind the hostess, looking very gentle and friendly. The reporter recalled the "Beware of dogs" sign in front of the door and the "Beware of ferocious dogs" sign behind the door, and could not help but smile silently. After sitting down, Mrs. Jia said that the news of her son's drowning was indeed true, but the exact circumstances of the matter were not clear. There were a total of three people traveling together. Her son was eight and a half years old, one was nine years old, and the oldest was nine years old. However, the one with the highest height was the nine-year-old, followed by her son, and the ten-year-old was very short. The news of Kang's drowning was received at 3:00 pm yesterday, and the location was Huangpu.</p>
<p>Clothes Cannot Be Found. Later, she mentioned that the oldest child often came to her to take Lukonsky out to play, and they had a close relationship. However, sometimes there were inevitably mischievous actions. When Mrs. Jia spoke to this point, her words were choked and her heart seemed extremely sad. When she spoke about her son's situation when he encountered the disaster, she felt even more sad. She said, "I once asked the child who returned about what happened to the clothes, shoes, and pants of my son, who had died, which could be used as evidence. The child replied that Kang was still wearing his shoes when he entered the water, and as for the clothes, they were used as floats and had already been taken off." Mrs. Jia's appearance seemed to still not believe that her son had suffered such a quick demise. Since it was late, the reporter briefly said a few words and then took his leave. The two small, white dogs still accompanied their pitiful hostess to the door to see him off.</p>
<p>The Truth is Also Bizarre. According to the police interrogation, Lukonsky's drowning seems to be beyond doubt. As for the cause of death, according to the report of the two children who returned, the situation was this: The ship was sailing in the Huangpu River near Donggou. The three children left the ship to swim, and the first mate, Lukonsky, somehow drowned. However, whether there is any suspicion in it is still under investigation. One of the children in the same group reportedly had very bad behavior in peacetime. He often had strange ideas during games. Once, he hid Lukongsky in one place and then went to his mother to tell him that he was missing. Lukongsky's mother gave this child a few small silver dollars before he was sent back, which seemed to have a preliminary kidnapping meaning. Now, this bad news is really unfortunate. The implication of this child is out of our conjecture.</p>

<p>Tong Will Appeal for the Third Trial</p>
<p>Tong Sanmao was unable to satisfy his desire for the dancer Huang Baiying, so he threatened Baiying to take poison. After being rescued by the hospital, the police prosecuted Tong for the crime of inciting others to commit suicide. The first trial sentenced Tong Sanmao to two years of imprisonment, and Tong filed an appeal. The Jiangsu High Court Second Branch opened a court for a retrial and concluded yesterday at 2:00 pm for the sentencing period. The police escorted Tong to the First Tribunal of the High Court. Tong's elder brother, Damao, and the lawyer were both in court waiting for instructions. Soon, President Song and the two Judges Du Gao ascended the seat and ordered Tong Sanmao to be brought forward to inquire about his name and age. Once he had passed, he announced the main text of the judgment. Tong Sanmao's appeal was rejected and he was still escorted back to the police station for custody by the police. It was heard that Tong was still unwilling to submit and would appeal for the third trial. If so, the determination of this case will still require a considerable amount of time.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Pirates Leave Da'an Port Outside Wusongkou <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Da'an Port, at the junction of Nantong and Haimen counties outside Wusongkou, was occupied by a large number of pirates, and the situation was extremely rampant. The Jiangsu Water Police Provincial Public Security Team Wusong Fourth District Chief Zhang Han repeatedly sent the 17th and 18th patrol boats and gunboats under his jurisdiction to the port to suppress them. The details were recorded in this newspaper. However, because the port forks were arranged within more than ten miles around Da'an Port, the shifting sands flooded constantly. Therefore, although the water police repeatedly went to suppress them, the pirates stubbornly resisted and the water police were outnumbered. Up to now, they have not been able to suppress them. Unexpectedly, the pirates dispatched pirate ships in all directions to rob civilian ships in various oceans, totaling more than 50 ships, plus the original pirate ships, there were a total of 100 ships, all of which were docked at the north port of Da'an Port. At about 10:00 pm that night, all the bandits, more than 700 people, gathered in an orderly manner and transported all the military equipment, baggage, food, and valuable stolen goods to the port and loaded them on the pirate ships. The bandits were deployed until 5:00 am yesterday before they were ready, and then they boarded the ships in groups, raised their sails, and went to the East China Sea. One day before the pirates left, they sent a letter to the local authorities, saying that the army had been ordered to depart and that all the civilian houses occupied in Da'an Port should be sent to be taken over. Now there is no trace of bandits in the port, and the whereabouts of more than 20 men, women, and children who were kidnapped by those people are unknown. Most of them have been taken away by the pirates. The purpose of the pirates' sudden departure from Da'an Port is difficult to guess, and where they are going is temporarily unknown. After Jiangsu Water Police Provincial Public Security Team Wusong Fourth District Chief Zhang Han was reported yesterday, he was concerned that Da'an Port had numerous port forks and a dangerous terrain, fearing that the bandits would come back after they left, or that another group of pirates would go to occupy it. The consequences would be unimaginable. Therefore, he has urgently ordered the 17th Team Captain Gong Jinqin and the 18th Team Captain Lin Cha to quickly send multiple patrol boats to the port to patrol and defend each port.</p>
<h3 id="e140">The Shanghai Land Bureau Seriously Inspects Field Certificates <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Land Bureau is earnestly carrying out the work of reorganizing land, and the inspection of field certificates is also extremely serious. The field certificates issued by Shanghai County in the fifth year of Xianfeng have not been replaced for a long time, and there are many counterfeit certificates. The Shanghai Land Bureau affixed the fake certificate invalidation stamp on all the field certificates sent for verification by the Jiangsu Shanghai Local Court and the Special Zone Local Court, as well as those who changed the Yongzu contract and Chinese who applied for land certificates, as long as there were fake certificates. However, after the fake certificate was found and stamped as invalid, if the property rights part has other strong evidence, it will still be recognized, so although the crackdown is strict, the people are not resentful. Recently, Wang Guantong requested to sell the fake certificate of Wang Zhizhong's household, No. 57, Eleven Qiu, Yinzitu Di Ziwei, Jiangwan District, to the real estate contract distribution office in the district. The office was detained and handed over to the land bureau for investigation together with the fake certificate. It is heard that the land bureau has prepared a document to transfer it to the Jiangsu Shanghai Local Court to thoroughly investigate the origin of Wang Guantong's fake certificate and arrest the person who forged the field certificate and handle it according to law. The bureau's serious inspection will eliminate fake certificates in the future, and the credibility of land certificates will inevitably increase day by day.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Price Change of Shanghai South Public Bus Route 4 <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Original Price of Each Ticket Increased by Two Cents</p>
<p>Changed to Incremental One Cent Per Stop</p>
<p>Shanghai South Public Bus Route 4 runs between Xujiahui and the Hongqiao Road Airport. The fare for the route was originally 5 cents at the start to 40 cents. In July of this year, the company reported to the Municipal Public Utility Bureau for approval to increase the fares of all routes by 2 cents per ticket due to the strange price of gold and the soaring price of gasoline. Therefore, Route 4 should be 7 cents from the starting station to 42 cents. However, the company ultimately believed that the route had suffered huge losses over the years and that an increase of two cents per ticket was not enough to make up for it, and that the route was a long-distance route and was different from other routes. It repeatedly stated the difficult situation to the bureau and asked to be allowed to increase one cent per stop. It is heard that the bureau verified that it was true and had already submitted it to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>

<p>The Chinese Buddhist Travel Group has been in Shanghai for more than a month and has been well received by celebrities from all walks of life. Now that all the procedures of the group have been prepared, they will take the Guangli Wheel to Xiamen and Taiwan this morning, and then transfer to the South China Sea. It is heard that Wang Yiting, Yu Youren, Ye Gongchuo, Zhang Taihuo, Ding Fubao, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Lin Jing, Shi Taixu, and other hundreds of people inscribed for the group in Shanghai to encourage them and there were many banquets by Friendship Travel Group, Oriental Cultural Society, Buddhist Studies Research Society, World Lay Buddhist Forest, Chinese Buddhist Association and other groups. All the people who prepared all the work for the group were promising young people who took hardship as a principle and did not solicit donations from Buddhist circles and other places in Shanghai, which was truly commendable. Those who gave travel gifts included the China National Goods Joint Department Store's domestic exquisite towel magnetic bowl manufacturing supplies to express their admiration.</p>

<p>Li Xiuzhen, a 31-year-old woman from Shanghai, lives at No. 96 Pingle Lane, Er Ma Road. She is fashionably dressed and has a beautiful appearance. Yesterday, she had an argument with her husband for some reason, and then she went to the Bund outside San Ma Road alone at 11:00 pm and jumped into the river to end her life. It was seen by a police officer from No. 135, Old Gate, who quickly rescued the woman and took her to Renji Hospital for treatment. After taking some medicine, she was safe. The police officer then took the woman to the Old Gate Police Station.</p>
<h3 id="e144">The Truth of the Case Against Dr. Gu <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Orders the Return of His License First</p>
<p>The Court Investigates and Orders His Release Pending Further Action</p>
<p>Fang Yongtai, a Jiangbei resident, brought his son, who had developed a sore boil on his forehead a month prior, to Dr. Gu Xiaoyan, a Chinese medicine practitioner specializing in surgery on Zixia Road. Dr. Gu diagnosed the child with a high fever and proceeded to treat the boil with surgery while advising the parents to urgently seek treatment for the internal symptoms at a pediatrics clinic, warning of possible convulsions if delayed. However, due to financial constraints, the Fang family did not seek the care of a pediatric doctor. The next day, the child indeed suffered a convulsion and was brought back to Dr. Gu. Dr. Gu observed that the child's condition was critical and, upon learning that internal treatment had not been sought, urged them again to seek pediatric care. Subsequently, the child died from the convulsion, and the family reported the incident to the Bureau of Health. The Bureau, fearing medical malpractice, temporarily suspended Dr. Gu's license and forwarded the entire case file to the Municipal Government for review. After a thorough review, the Municipal Government concluded that the child's death was not necessarily due to Dr. Gu's negligence and ordered the Bureau of Health to reinstate Dr. Gu's license. However, recognizing that the case involved a human life, the Municipal Government deemed it necessary to thoroughly investigate the facts and transferred the case to the Shanghai District Court for investigation. After investigation, the Prosecutor's Office ordered Dr. Gu's release pending further action. It is reported that the Fang family, grieving the loss of their child, acted out of temporary distress and made things difficult for Dr. Gu. Dr. Gu, on the other hand, had diligently provided treatment and was not negligent. The Chinese Medicine Association also conducted a thorough investigation and confirmed that Dr. Gu had done everything properly. Dr. Gu has since received his license back and has resumed seeing patients as usual.</p>

They confiscated the lamps and equipment used for consuming red pills and arrested Yang Xueying, who was selling red pills. A box of red pills was found on Yang's person. Red pill lamps and equipment were also confiscated from the residences of Liu A'er at No. 7 Minhang Street and Cai A'da at No. 7 Yuxing Street outside Xiaodongmen. All those arrested were taken to the police station and presented to the French court yesterday for prosecution.

<p>Ni Miaosheng, a 26-year-old boatman from Wusong Yunzaobang, had a 13-year-old sister named Miaoling. Yesterday, around 5:00 AM, the brother and sister were loading cargo onto their boat to take it to port. While rowing along the Yunzaobang near the western end of Tang Bridge, the oar rope suddenly broke. Miaoling accidentally fell into the river. The current was strong, and she was swept westward. Her brother, Ni Miaosheng, saw this from the front of the boat and was greatly alarmed. He quickly grabbed a bamboo pole and jumped into the river to save her. As a result, Miaoling grabbed the end of the pole and pulled herself into the boat, avoiding drowning. Ni Miaosheng, who was somewhat skilled in swimming, struggled in the water while trying to save his sister. After Miaoling climbed onto the boat, her brother disappeared. Then, his bamboo pole was seen floating on the water's surface, indicating that he had drowned. Miaoling shouted for help. Nearby boats heard her cries and came to rescue Ni Miaosheng. However, he had swallowed too much water and could not be revived. He was dead, though his body was still warm. His elderly mother arrived upon hearing the news and mourned over his body. The family prepared a coffin on the boat and proceeded with the burial arrangements.</p>

<p>Li Xiangqing, a 38-year-old resident of Chuansha, Pudong, lives in a bungalow at the end of Baoding Road and works as a warehouse clerk at the Huachang Ice Factory on Huade Road. His second son, Rongquan, six years old, had been suffering from diarrhea for the past two days. His wife, Mrs. Yang, was told that eating opium ash could stop diarrhea. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, Mrs. Yang obtained a packet of opium ash and made her son take it with boiled water. After a while, she noticed that her son's complexion was poor, so she rushed him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. He arrived at the hospital at 8:15 AM, but he had already died and could not be saved. The incident was immediately reported to the Hongkou Police Station, and the body was sent to the morgue for examination.</p>

<p>Clothes Barely Covering Their Bodies in a Small Inn</p>
<p>Shameless Couple Handed Over to the Authorities</p>
<p>Xu A'long, a 51-year-old sailor foreman from Ningbo, had a second wife named Wang Cuiyu (also known as Xu A'yue), 30 years old. She despised her husband's age and ugliness, and because he was often away from home, she lacked affection. She somehow took a liking to Hu Yongkang (also known as Hu A'yue), who sold "Galing" medicine water on the streets. Hu was a pauper whose clothes were ragged and inadequate, but he was younger than her husband, only 27 years old. She often met with him secretly and provided financial support. They even had a photo taken together at a photo studio. When she returned home, she hid the photo in a box. In July, Xu discovered the photo and confronted her. In a fit of desperation, she and Hu fled together and took up residence in Room 14 of the Yongxing Inn on Xixin Bridge in the French Concession. All their expenses were paid by her, and they were reduced to a state where their clothes barely covered their bodies. Their resources were exhausted. To make matters worse, their hideout was discovered by Xu. The day before yesterday, he reported the matter to the Public Security Bureau, which dispatched detectives and police officers to arrest the adulterous couple. They were taken to the Second District and then transferred to the District Court for questioning.</p>

<p>Zhu Lushi's Sinister Intentions</p>
<p>Lu Genhe Escorts Them Back to Shanghai</p>
<p>Zhang Jinbao, a local resident, has two daughters, Gen Di, 16, and Lan Ying, 14, who both work at the Yong'an Cotton Mill on Maigen Road in western Shanghai. On the morning of the eighth of this month, at 6:00 AM, the sisters were on their way to the factory from their home at No. 901 Xiaoshadu Road when they were lured by their neighbor, Zhu Lushi. They went with her to the North Railway Station. After a while, Zhu Lushi's paramour, Zhu Jintang, arrived and bought three train tickets. Zhu Lushi took the two girls onto the train and they arrived in Kunshan, where they stayed at an inn. The next day, they walked to Luxiang Village in Changshu and stayed at the home of Lu Genhe, Zhu Lushi's nephew. Zhu Lushi told her nephew that the two girls accompanying her had been purchased for 400 yuan and would be married as daughters-in-law in the future. She asked him to temporarily accommodate them at his home. When the two girls heard this, they realized they had been abducted and cried loudly. Lu Genhe asked the girls what had happened and learned the truth. He disapproved of his aunt's actions. Zhu Lushi, seeing that Genhe was not on her side, fled secretly that evening. The next day, Genhe, unsure of his aunt's whereabouts, sent the two girls back to Shanghai by steamer. In fact, Zhu Lushi knew that her nephew would not tolerate her actions and that her plan would be exposed. She had already planned to retaliate. That night, she secretly returned to Kunshan and took a train to Shanghai. She went directly to the Zhang family and asked why their daughters were suddenly in Luxiang Village, Changshu. She claimed to have just seen them there. Zhang, who had been searching for his daughters since their disappearance, was about to go look for them. Zhu Lushi claimed that since they had been abducted, it was possible that the abductors had taken them elsewhere and that they should wait at the various docks. Zhang then ordered his wife, Guo, to wait at the Suzhou River dock with Zhu Lushi, while Zhang and Zhu Lushi's paramour, Zhu Jintang, rushed to Luxiang Village. When they arrived at Lu's house, they learned that the girls had already been taken back to Shanghai by Lu. They immediately returned together, while Lu arrived at the port by steamer with the two girls. They were seen by the girls' mother as soon as they disembarked and were taken home together. Zhang and Zhu returned by train. When the train arrived at the North Station and they were walking along the border road, Zhu suddenly pointed to Zhang to a sentry at No. 1475 and accused him of robbing him. Zhang was arrested by the sentry and taken to the Huisi Police Station. After learning the truth, the police chief determined that the case fell under the jurisdiction of the Gordon Road Police Station and transferred Zhu to that station. After investigation, the police arrested Zhu Lushi. Yesterday morning, Zhang Jinbao and his wife, as well as the two girls and the witness Lu Genhe, were brought to the Special District Court. After a thorough investigation by Judge Wu Tingqi, Zhu Lushi and Zhu Jintang were found guilty of two counts of conspiring to abduct women under the age of 20 from those with parental rights for profit. Each charge carried a sentence of two years in prison, with a total sentence of three years for each. Zhang Gendi and Zhang Lanying were allowed to be taken back by their father, Zhang Jinbao.</p>

<p>Temporarily Not Leaving Shanghai</p>
<p>Zhang Huichong, a former movie star and now a "water escape" magician, had already purchased tickets to travel to various ports in Southeast Asia to perform his magic. However, his creditors, Zhong Caiji and Xie Qinglong, found out. Before Zhang performed his magic at the Baixing Theater in Zhabei that evening, he petitioned the Fifth District, Second Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau to notify the Baixing Theater to detain Zhang's magic equipment. Jin Yu, a lawyer, also filed a petition with the Shanghai District Court requesting permission to seize Zhang's assets. After this news was published, the Star Film Company, noting that Zhang Huichong had signed a contract with the company to film "Water Margin" with Zhang playing the lead role of Wu Song, claimed that the film had not yet been completed and that the company would suffer significant losses if he left. Therefore, the company's representative, Zhang Shichuan, hired Zhan Jifeng as a lawyer to file a civil lawsuit with the Shanghai Special District Court accusing Zhang Huichong of violating the contract and demanding compensation for all losses. However, Zhang Huichong was aware that Star had filed a lawsuit, so yesterday he asked friends to contact Star Company to negotiate a settlement, stating that he was still willing to continue filming "Water Margin" to avoid harming both parties' interests. Whether this matter can be resolved peacefully remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Wang, inside the Zhejiang Shaoxing Guild Hall on Fuyou Road, Houjiabang, near the old North Gate, is fond of planting lotus flowers. Every year, dozens of pots are planted in the courtyards of the front and rear halls. This summer, during the lotus flower blooming season, a strange flower bloomed, called the Thousand-Layer Lotus. After it was published in the newspapers, flower enthusiasts from all over came to see it, and many called it strange. After the Beginning of Autumn, the lotus flowers all withered. A few days ago, another strange lotus flower bloomed. The flower's center has no lotus seeds, only petals, and is double-hearted, slightly larger than ordinary flowers. It has been blooming for two weeks and has not yet withered, remaining fresh and lovely. Mr. Wang cherishes it and invited a photographer to take pictures of the flower to keep as a souvenir.</p>

<p>Yu Zhongnan (also known as Xiangming), the manager of the Yiji Lead and Zinc Mining Company, had a felt hat snatched by thugs near the Ningbo Road Concession. He was unable to catch up at the time and reported the incident to the relevant police station. Rumors spread that Mr. Yu had been beaten unconscious by thugs and that he was a "commissioner for splitting profits." These rumors are not true. Mr. Yu has always been known to be reliable. In addition to being the manager of the Yiji Lead and Zinc Mining Company, he is also the vice manager of the Fuda Company and has never held the title of "commissioner." He was not beaten on that day. This is likely a misunderstanding based on rumors.</p>

<p>Two Accidents Occur Simultaneously</p>
<p>Lu Zhenxiang, a resident of Shaoxing residing on Baoshan Road in Zhabei, had a five-year-old son named Lu Rubao. The day before yesterday, around 11:00 AM, Lu's mother-in-law, Qin Wang, was taking him for a walk on Baoshan Road. A truck, No. 2506, coming from Jiangwan, driven by Yao A'da, did not stay on the right side of the road. Qin Wang was unable to pull her grandson out of the way, and Lu Rubao was knocked down and his head and feet were crushed. The truck driver panicked and swerved, also crashing into a rickshaw pulled by Hu Dengfa, who suffered minor injuries. The police arrested Yao and detained him in the Fifth District Police Station. Lu Rubao was sent to Jisheng Hospital for treatment but died. Yesterday, the police station transferred the plaintiff and defendant together to the District Court for preliminary hearing, after which Yao A'da was ordered to be detained pending examination of the body for further handling.</p>
<p>Jumping Off a Car Causes Death: Bian Hengji Stone Works, next to Xiaowanliutang in the West Market of Caojiadu in western Shanghai, had its own truck with Concession License No. 16674. Yesterday morning at approximately 11:35, the truck was fully loaded with mud and sand being transported to Shanghai. Wu, the clerk of the stone works (in his forties), needed to go to Shanghai on business. He rode on the truck. Unexpectedly, when the truck was near Gordon Road and was traveling at high speed, the clerk suddenly wanted to get off. Before the driver could stop, Wu jumped off. His legs were crushed, and the wheels ran over his body, causing his abdomen to rupture and his intestines and internal organs to spill out. The scene was gruesome. The patrolman saw what happened and immediately took the driver back to the police station to report the incident. The body of the deceased was sent to the morgue on Feilun Road for examination and subsequent coffin and burial.</p>
<p>Boy A'er Dies: Zhang A'ming, a driver for the Fada Auto Company at No. 300 Bai'er Road, French Concession, drove a car past No. 1260 Zhongxing Road, Zhabei, on the 9th of this month and knocked down Liu Zhang's nine-year-old son, A'er, who lived in the house. The boy was seriously injured and was sent to Baolong Hospital on Baker Road by his family, where he died the day before yesterday. The hospital reported this to the Xinzha Police Station, and detectives sent the body to the Feilun Road morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, Xu, a prosecutor from the Special District Court, was dispatched to the morgue to examine the body. According to the police chief's report, the case occurred in the Chinese area, while the driver lived in the French Concession, neither of which was under their jurisdiction. Therefore, the Municipal Council could not file a public prosecution. Prosecutor Xu then instructed the boy's mother, Liu Zhang, to sign a statement to claim the body for coffin and burial and instructed her to file a lawsuit with the Shanghai District Court. Knocked Down and Killed Foster Daughter: Ding Chen, a Jiangbei woman residing at Kangjili No. 13, at the intersection of Bailaini, Monmalang Road, and Kangti Road in the French Concession, had a 15-year-old foster daughter, Ding Zhaodi. Yesterday morning, Zhaodi went out to sell straw sandals at 8:00 AM. While walking along the Fada Road, she was struck by a car. Zhaodi was unable to avoid it and was knocked down, hitting her head and losing consciousness. The police arrived, recorded the license plate number, and reported to the police chief. The injured person was sent to Renji Hospital by car. Due to the severity of her injuries, she died shortly after being admitted to the hospital.

<p>The Fushou Pharmacy at the intersection of Simalu and Wangping Street sells a kind of "White Discharge Elixir," and business is not bad, attracting the attention of petty thieves. The day before yesterday evening, a man dressed in a khaki shirt came to buy two bottles of the "White Discharge Elixir" and paid with a five-yuan bill, receiving two yuan in change. The man claimed that he would come back to pick up the medicine later, but he did not return by closing time. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning at about 7:00 AM, before the pharmacy opened, the man suddenly came and knocked on the door to pick up the medicine. The shop assistant, Yu Caisheng, opened the door and let him in. The thief immediately grabbed a key, showed a pistol, and threatened Yu into silence. He then went to the desk drawer, searched and robbed more than 20 yuan in cash, locked Yu inside the room, and escaped. After the thief left, Yu dared to speak out. The tea house opened the door and released him, and he went to the Fuzhou Road patrol station to report the incident and request assistance in apprehending the thief.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Industrial Rationalization (Continuation 4) Cheng Zhenjun <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>As for worker unemployment, it is even less the fault of rationalization. Currently, the countries with the most unemployment are Germany, with about three million people, followed by the United Kingdom, with about two million people. France can be said to have no unemployment. Before the European War, Germany had only 18 million workers, but now it has 22.5 million. This means that industrial rationalization has increased the number of workers by 4.5 million. The reason for the large number of unemployed is that Germans in the ceded territories, not forgetting their homeland, have rushed back to their hometowns, numbering about one million. In addition, the army used to have 750,000 people, but now only 100,000 are retained. Furthermore, there were hundreds of thousands of people manufacturing military equipment, but now they have all changed professions. This is the reason for the sudden increase in unemployment in Germany. The United Kingdom has been very slow in adopting rationalization. The coal and iron industries are the basic industries of the United Kingdom, and they are in contact and competition with the most developed rationalization in Germany and the United States everywhere. However, because the prices are so different, British goods are extremely difficult to sell. In addition, the best markets in the world, such as China and India, are in a state of unrest, making it even more difficult for British industry to develop. Therefore, the unemployment of British workers cannot be blamed on rationalization. The Englishman Uickrw, in his book "The Meaning of Rationalization," painfully stated that the failure of the United Kingdom to vigorously implement rationalization has led to difficulties in industry and commerce, which further proves that rationalization is not the cause of worker unemployment. Moreover, France has specifically set up agencies to implement rationalization, and workers have not lost their jobs. It can be seen that rationalization can make industry prosper. Once industry can prosper, workers will not lose their jobs. Therefore, it can be said that rationalization can prevent workers from losing their jobs, but it is absolutely unreasonable to say that rationalization causes workers to lose their jobs. I have already described the origin, meaning, plan, and functions of rationalization in detail. Now, I will briefly contribute some humble opinions on how our country should start to proceed, to end my article. Our country's industry is young and lacks organization and talent everywhere, and the government and the people have never had a habit of cooperation. Therefore, we can only start with research. The central government should set up an Industrial Rationalization Research Association, and each province and city should set up a Research Association. The government should invite people from the industrial sector with knowledge and reputation to conduct joint research. However, two important points should be noted: (1) Broadly raise funds; (2) Hire several specialists to be solely responsible for various research tasks without holding other positions. Then, collect books, magazines, and newspapers from various countries regarding rationalization, study them in detail, and communicate with the League of Nations and rationalization agencies in various countries, as well as organizations and groups related to rationalization. Then, understand the actual situation in China, consider what should be publicized first, what should be investigated first, what should be organized first, where should experimental laboratories be set up, what matters should be sent abroad for contact, how to disseminate the results of research to various industries, how to make various industries adopt rationalization, how to cultivate the talents needed by the industrial sector, and other issues. The government representatives and industrial leaders should pass the proposals put forward by the specialized researchers through meetings, and then they can be put into practice. This is the driving force for rationalization. As for implementation, it is still a matter for the industrial sector itself. The government and this agency are only in a position to assist and guide. Alas, our country's national character is extremely decadent. Most government officials consider it a skill to get by with perfunctory measures. Industrial leaders are content with the status quo and are too modest to take action. Young people only engage in clamoring and are unwilling to conduct specialized research. Compared with the American's courage and pursuit of efficiency, the German's meticulous scientific research and adherence to order, and the Englishman's deep, decisive, self-respect, and self-esteem, the difference is truly immeasurable. We should urgently abandon the bad habits of sluggishness and procrastination and strive to uplift ourselves. We should also earnestly guard against empty, lofty, and far-reaching fantasies and focus on research. This industrial rationalization is the touchstone for our nation's revitalization, the savior of industrial decline, a major reform in economic organization, and a good opportunity for cooperation between the government and the people. I hope that the government, the industrial sector, and the general public in our country will rise up and work together to achieve the suggestions made by the International Economic Conference. China is fortunate, and the world is fortunate.</p>

<h3 id="e171">International Art Exhibition <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>– Chen Deming</p>
<p>The French Salon exhibition and the British Royal Exhibition are both watched by the world. However, these exhibitions are limited to a narrow scope within one country. The one that brings together masterpieces of modern art from various countries in one place for a grand exhibition is the International Art Exhibition held in Venice, Italy. The Venice International Art Exhibition is a general exhibition of art from various countries in the world, just as the Summer Olympics is a general competition of sports from various countries. The exhibition is held every two years in the city of Venice, Italy, because Italy is the source of art in the world, and Venice is the art center of Italy, and the scenery is beautiful and picturesque, making it most suitable for holding art exhibitions. Because this exhibition is held every two years and the venue is in Venice, it is named the Venice Biennale (VeniceBiennialExhilition). Every time the exhibition is held, not to mention that the whole city of Venice is empty and people go to visit, people from other parts of Italy and art lovers from Europe and the United States also go to visit from thousands of miles away. It is truly the most grand event in international art. This year's 17th exhibition was held in the summer, and the grand occasion was no less than in the past. European and American countries and Japan in East Asia all had works on display (our country is the only one without any products, and I don't know what the Chinese people think about this). The countries with the most products, such as Italy, France, Germany, England, the United States, the Netherlands, Belgium, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, all opened up a separate venue for display and exhibition. The grand occasion of the exhibition will be described separately as follows:</p>
<p>Italian Department</p>
<p>Italy is the host of the International Exhibition, so let's first talk about the Italian Department in the exhibition. Because Italy is the host of the conference, there are so many products that it is dazzling, making people feel like they are on Shanyin Road, with too many things to see. However, these thousands of works have a unified color, which is the color of restoration (I use the word restoration instead of restoration because they are not returning to classicism, but abandoning futurism, etc.). Now let's talk about painting and sculpture separately.</p>
<p>Painting</p>
<p>Italian paintings in this exhibition can be divided into three categories based on the subject matter:</p>
<p>(A) Historical Paintings</p>
<p>The revival of Italian historical paintings is a natural result, because in recent years, the activities of Mussolini and his Fascist Party are excellent ready-made subjects for painters, which they cannot abandon. Therefore, modern Italian historical paintings are different from historical paintings that usually depict events and figures from the past. In fact, they are realistic paintings of Italian political activities. We call them historical paintings for the sake of future generations. These paintings are full of modern meaning, unlike historical paintings that depict ancient people and ancient objects, which cannot arouse the interest of modern people. At the same time, these paintings are not political propaganda like Soviet Russian art, but purely narrative paintings. Among the historical painters, ArnaldoCarpananettl, PrimsConti, and TononaspCascella are the most worthy of mention. They faithfully reproduce the past activities and revolutionary process of the Fascist Party on the screen. Their paintings can be compared to the great paintings of Delacroix, the great French romantic painter of the nineteenth century. The Marseillaise aroused extraordinary excitement in the audience.</p>
<p>(B) Figure Paintings</p>
<p>Italy has always been famous for its figure paintings. There are many noteworthy works in this International Exhibition. These works are noteworthy for two reasons: one is because the figures in the paintings are noteworthy, such as the portraits of celebrities such as poets D'Annunzio and Novaro made by Bucci, DeMaria, Galanti, Frescia, Lambertini, and Casella. The other is known for its technique, such as the realistic figure paintings of GiussppeAmlsani, Saliett, Monti, Gaudenzii, and Conti Bucci, and the poetic figure paintings of Vonni Vagnetti Bucci, all of which have deeply understood the essence of art in the Renaissance era, and Feltrinelli's color-based figure paintings are especially eye-catching.</p>
<p>(C) Landscape Paintings</p>
<p>Italian landscape paintings, whether in terms of theme or style, are full of local scenery. Bacci, Caligiani, Dani, Gueriu, and Monti depicted the Tuscan landscape. Tosi, Pratell, Arata, Fuimi, and Prada depicted the Lombardy landscape. Figiari and Biasi depicted island scenery. The landscape painters influenced by France are Sobrero, Chessa, and Paolucci.</p>
<p>Sculpture</p>
<p>Recent Italian sculpture art, as seen from this international development, has resolutely returned to the path of classicism. It goes without saying that old writers such as Andereorti, Maraini, Romanelli, Secretary General of the Congress, and Baroni all studied ancient sculpture as the basis for their creation. For example, FrancescoMessina extracted the essence and hints of the sculptures of Pompeii (which was submerged by volcanic eruptions centuries ago and has recently been excavated, yielding many ancient artworks) to create their analytical sculptures. Marchini found the secret of rhyme in the sculptures of the Roman Empire era. Marini obtained his extraordinary realistic ability from ancient Etruscan sculptures. Some sculptors take modern athletes and athletes as objects to express strong physiques, just like ancient Greek sculptors used warriors and athletes as themes. Among the female sculptors who can be mentioned are EglePozzi and MaryalLednicka, both of whom are young female writers with artistic beauty.</p>
<p>In addition, black and white paintings (including sketches, prints, woodcuts, etc.) are also very noteworthy. The representative writers are Bartoli, Carbonati, Mazzonizarini, Disertori, Magnavacca, Mauroner, and Bucci, all of whom are internationally renowned writers. Their tastes and styles are all modern, among which Bartolini and Bucci are the most outstanding.</p>
<p>The most memorable thing in the Italian Department is actually a room of works by the painter Modigliani. Modigliani was a genius in the modern art world, but his encounter was extremely pitiful. Because of his political party relationship, he was not tolerated by the government. He lived in Paris, France, and engaged in painting. His paintings were too high in style and were not recognized by the people of the time. No one bought them. In 1920, he starved to death in a slum in Paris. Only in recent years have his paintings been valued. Now he has occupied a permanent place in the history of art. This time, the International Development brought together more than 50 of his paintings made in his life and exhibited them in a room, which was unprecedented. There were many viewers in this room, all of whom lingered and were reluctant to leave. One reason was to appreciate Modigliani's superb art, and the other was to lament his tragic life.</p>
<p>French Department</p>
<p>France is the center of modern art and naturally occupies a leading position in the International Art Exhibition. There are too many French artists, and they are all well-known, so I will not describe them in detail here. However, we can summarize by saying that French art in this exhibition shows the French national character more significantly than in the past. The most eye-catching painter is VanDongen. He is the pride of the modern French art world. He uses rich and gorgeous colors to depict beautiful women and concubines inside and outside Paris, which are full of fascination. The International Exhibition specially opened a room to display his paintings, which has a strong attraction to the audience.</p>
<p>German Department</p>
<p>The German paintings displayed in this International Art Exhibition can also be summarized in one sentence, that is, the German national character they show is also more significant than in the past. German art is inherently rich in national character. In the years after the end of the European War, the German art world once joined hands with the art worlds of other European countries, but now they have parted ways and taken their own paths. In the International Exhibition, MaxBeckmann's comprehensive paintings, OttoDix's integrated figure paintings, and Barlack's strong and expressive sculptures all show the strong German national character, which is in stark contrast to VanDongen's gorgeous paintings and Despian's soft sculptures in the French Department.</p>
<p>British Department</p>
<p>The United Kingdom, which is famous for its conservatism, is the only one in this international art exhibition that tends to restoration to advocate for new art. For example, PaulNash in painting is the only surviving representative of Futurism in this international exhibition. In the previous International Exhibition, Futurist works filled all the rooms. For example, RichardSickert is an Impressionist painter, and GlynPhilpot's decorative paintings are full of modern mystery. In terms of sculpture, Moore's works are between black art and Cubism. JohnSkeaping's sculptures contain primitivity. In addition, John Nash, such as the watercolor paintings of the Paul Nash brothers, Dodd, the engraving of John, and the prints of Sickert and Rusbbwry are the best in the audience.</p>
<p>American Department</p>
<p>The United States has a separate department in the International Art Exhibition, which is a notable event that began this year. With an independent department, people have a whole understanding of American art. Previously, people thought that the United States was a country without art because they did not have a deep understanding of American art. However, from this International Art Exhibition, it seems that the United States is indeed a rising star, and the future is very bright. In this exhibition, the paintings that are worthy of mention are the portrait paintings of GeorzeBrush, AlexanderBrook, JSidneyDickinson, NicholaiTechin, and CharlesHopkins. The figure paintings of GeorgeBellows, CeciliaBeaux, MauriceFromkes, and KarlAnderson are especially outstanding and have the style of masters. The new writers are HoratisWalker and Katz. The sculptures that are worthy of mention are MalvinaHoffmann and MccartanEward.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned countries are the most important and most noticed in the International Art Exhibition. As for other countries, or only a small department is set up, or the exhibitions are combined, which are relatively secondary and will not be mentioned in detail.</p>
<p>In summary, the International Art Exhibition is a general expression of the artistic activities of various nations in the world. We have seen the following key points regarding the recent trends in world art in this International Exhibition:</p>
<p>Pay attention to the expression of national character</p>
<h3 id="e172">On the History of Modern Art Trends <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>– Yi Kang</p>
<p>An Art History Dominated by National Color</p>
<p>The development of European art trends from the French Revolution to the past hundred years is an extremely complex and rapid page in the history of art. During this era, because of the liberation of political thought and the enlightenment of politics, almost all the people in Europe ran out of the shackles of the old days and participated in the creation of art. Therefore, the strong colors of each nation's territory and the spirit of the storm era are presented in the art of the entire Europe. Therefore, we must trace the modern art to this great period, and especially important is not to ignore that the main trend of art in this period is the national color.</p>
<p>In the world's history of art trends literature, Professor Takaho Itagaki's "History of Modern Art Trends" is worth mentioning, which uses national color as the center to describe it. He abandoned the scattered and non-central thinking narratives of those who have studied art history in the past and made a bold attempt based on a fundamental concept and principle. Therefore, it is a unique success for him to describe the history of modern art trends with national color, because art, like literature, cannot reconcile exoticism or suppress local colors. Therefore, the depiction of art in Northern Europe, such as Sweden and Norway, depicts everything in the ice and snow and half-year daylight. French, German, and Italian art has the rich colors of Southern Europe. Slavic art has the vast continent's melancholy and fortitude. Indian and black art has strong national colors. Therefore, in his book, he uses the scale of national color to measure the art trends of various nations in this era. In this way, in his scale, we can see the qualities and significance of the art produced in that era.</p>
<p>In the history of art, the recently popular artistic will (Kurstwollen) does not have any consistent and unified concept to indicate the content. Therefore, some people think that this sentence refers to the form of creation of an era divided according to cultural history, and some scholars use it as the meaning of the expression style inherent in a nation. However, the scale for evaluating art cannot be immutable, just as relativity replaces absolutism in physics, the examination of art also raises doubts in an immutable scale evaluation. Therefore, people who use and admire artistic will abandon its permanent value in doubt and seek another relative scale to estimate the value of the art of each era and each nation with the scale of that era and that nation. This new method has aroused people's attention, and the horizons of art historians have become broader and the understanding has clearly progressed. In this way, the artist will not be biased towards one aspect, that is, the early foreigners, but in this method, a new art historian should be a fair observer, and at the same time, should try to be a warm sympathizer, and even more should try to be a sharp insight, and a new cliché gradually emerged in the new method.</p>
<p>Therefore, the leader who insists on the position of shaping and firmly defends the territory, the French nation, who has dominated the European art world since the eighteenth century and has become the keynote of the art trend, has continued to grasp the long-term rule, and the one who is opposed to France is the Germans among the Northern European nations. The French are always true realists in terms of shaping, focusing on practical work, while the Northern European nations, although strong in character, are ultimately biased towards idealism, faithful to their own beliefs. Therefore, they do not use models and think about the mysteries of the non-human world. Therefore, they have always formed a decisive different direction from the painting school in Southern Europe.</p>
<p>The whole book takes national color as the warp and the thought of the times as the weft. In the nine chapters, it tells about the history of art trends after the French Revolution. He is the first person in the writing world to use national color as the center to study art trends. The Japanese version is published by Daiyoroi Kaku in Tokyo, and the Beixin Bookstore in China has a translation of Lu Xun before it changed direction. It is worth reading this masterpiece that organizes the history of art trends with a new method.</p>

<h3 id="e174">An Interview with George Bernard Shaw (3) <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Meeting Isadora Duncan</p>
<p>My encounter with Isadora… I've never seen her dance, which is a rare thing," Shaw said. "At that time, I did something I don't often do: I went into society. I attended a tea party hosted by Lady Scott.</p>
<p>I remember sitting on the sofa when suddenly, a woman I didn't know sat down beside me and asked,</p>
<p>'Are you Shaw?' 'Yes,' I replied.</p>
<p>She stretched out her arms. 'Come to me,' this woman said, 'I will love you forever!'</p>
<p>Shaw laughed as he recounted this story, as if the memory made him very happy.</p>
<p>I asked, "And what did you do?"</p>
<p>"I performed the second act of Tristan and Isolde," Shaw said. "For about an hour, Isadora and I continued talking. I don't remember what we said to each other, but I knew the bystanders were delighted to listen to our every word. I think at first, my hostess must have been a little anxious about how I would handle the situation."</p>
<p>I said, "I can well imagine the scene. Isadora often told me she should marry you or Augustus John. What was your impression of her?"</p>
<p>"Oh," Shaw said quietly, "The strange thing is, I don't remember much at all. The photos taken of her have some resemblance. Her photos are rare because each one seems to capture her unique style. To me, she seemed very plump. Oh, and she was very much like a piece of candy that has been struck."</p>
<p>I said to Shaw, "Poor Isadora, he described her perfectly. When he met her, she was already indifferent to her appearance, especially after the tragedy occurred, her demeanor suffered many reactions."</p>
<p>"She has the cheeks of a devil," Shaw said. "She speaks her mind freely. Yet, her skill lies in preventing others from calling her a demon."</p>
<p>At this moment, Shaw was sitting directly across from me, his attitude very amiable. I thought this was an opportunity to resolve a widely circulated anecdote about the playwright and Isadora.</p>
<p>According to this anecdote, there was a time when Isadora's beauty was considered by sculptors and artists to be the most beautiful in the world. She wrote a letter to Shaw, asking if he would be willing to have a child with her. She seemed to have said, "You have the most brilliant mind in the world, and I have the most beautiful body. So let us produce a perfect child." To this request, Shaw replied, "But what if the child is born with my body and your mind?"</p>
<p>This anecdote made Shaw laugh. All great writers find their own witticisms amusing.</p>
<p>"Actually," Shaw said, "this wasn't Isadora who proposed this to me. There are many famous women involved in the stories about me, especially Isadora Duncan. In fact, I received this strange proposition from a foreign actress whose name you wouldn't know, and I've forgotten it myself. But I definitely had that response."</p>
<p>Without the slightest conceit</p>
<p>One can say things to Shaw that one cannot say to ordinary people, because this famous playwright has much to be conceited about, but he has no conceit at all. So, I asked him a question that very few writers of his stature would be willing to answer. I suspect very few young people of my standing would be willing to ask him. But it is my belief that the more intelligent a person is, the less resentment they have toward a small, frank inquiry. In this particular situation, I gratefully say that my belief was fully proven.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Mr. Shaw," I said, "What's wrong with George Moore? He recently said he thought you were so vulgar. He also criticized you for publicizing unimportant things like your change of address. And he said you love talking about yourself so much that your plays give him a headache."</p>
<p>I know there are some celebrities who, if told for the first time about others' criticism of them, would blush and get angry without a doubt. But Shaw just smiled and said in a calm, graceful tone,</p>
<p>"I don't see anything wrong with George's jokes. I suspect that if he thinks I'm excessively vulgar, it's because a person without vulgarity is like someone without a stomach; they cannot survive. I publicized my change of address to teach George not to send the wrong letters. He can't blame me too much. I talk about myself because I have many meaningful and interesting experiences that can serve as useful evidence. I should do more of this work, but I feel a little tired and want to avoid social responsibilities. As for anyone whose plays sometimes give some people a headache, if George can't resist reading them, he can put them away. His discomfort might be good for him." (The End)</p>

<p>Approximately 100,000 Tons</p>
<p>Dalian Report: According to the South Manchuria Railway Survey Department's second harvest forecast for agricultural products in the Eastern Provinces this year (August 24), the total is estimated to be approximately 18,380,000 tons, an increase of 100,000 tons compared to last year. The contents of important grains are as follows: Soybeans and other beans: 5,400,000 tons; Sorghum: 4,680,000 tons; Millet: 3,280,000 tons; Corn: 580,000 tons; Wheat: 1,390,000 tons; Rice: 300,000 tons.</p>

<p>Those Caught Will Be Fined 25% of the Original Price</p>
<p>After the United States implemented new tariffs, the import tax rates on industrial products were increased, while the import tax rates on artworks and antiques were reduced. As a result, antique rugs and other items that had been absent from the United States for many years were imported in large numbers. However, the U.S. tax authorities, aware that many fakes are mixed in with artworks, have specifically stipulated that those caught will be fined 25% of the original price. The U.S. Ambassador in Paris has issued a public notice, which has caused anxiety among merchants in this sector. According to a well-known antique dealer in Paris, this law will mean that those importing fakes will sometimes pay total taxes reaching 90% of the original value, which is a waste compared to importing genuine goods.</p>

<p>Fayetteville, North Carolina Report: A long-term prisoner named William Daley recently conspired with two accomplices to steal a car and was pursued. The other two escaped, while Daley fled into the backyard of a residence to hide. He accidentally touched a door lock, making a sound that woke the resident, a Mr. Davenport Newgent. Newgent, seeing that the only weapon at hand was an alarm clock, threw it from the window, hitting Daley on the head. The loud ringing attracted the police, who arrived to find Daley half-conscious from the blow.</p>

<p>Japanese Authorities Express Agreement</p>
<p>Tokyo Report: Germany has proposed starting a regular air service between Europe and Asia to implement mail flights, publishing a major plan adapted to the era of practical aircraft. Germany will first conclude a friendly aviation treaty with China to realize a large-scale Sino-German joint venture airline. It is also planning to open an air route to Japan via Eastern Europe, Arabia, Indochina, and Vietnam. In late July, it submitted to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Communications a request for an intercontinental regular airmail service, seeking Japan's overall attitude and approval. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately held secret consultations with the Ministry of Communications and the Navy authorities. The consensus was that Japan currently has a regular air service plan between Fukuoka and Shanghai, which could be extended from Shanghai if the conditions are appropriate. Therefore, Japan replied to Germany, expressing support for the plan and requesting a specific proposal. The Japanese Ministry of Communications will proceed with specific plans after receiving the reply.</p>
