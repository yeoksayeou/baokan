<p>世界經濟衰竭。貨物過多工商業之競爭甚烈。於是各國不得不用關税保護政策。使外來之貨。不敵其國内之貨以保護已國之産業。據世界社所記。印度</p>
<p>意大利希臘墨西哥埃及澳洲皆增加外來貨物之税率。藉以自保其國貨誠不得已之舉也。</p>
<p>就上列增税之各國以觀保護國貨之急切。工商業不甚發達之國家實視工</p>
<p>商業發達之國家爲尤甚。蓋工商業不甚發達之國家。貨物不如工業發達之國家多而精良技術旣劣成本又貴。往往不能與外來之貨競爭故先受感覺。此其。一工商業發達之國家。不特外來之貨。其國中皆有與之相等者决不至不能與工競爭即有一二貨不如他國。亦有勝於他國之貨。銷售於他國市塲一出一人之間。尙能各得其利。若工商業不甚發達之國家。祗有外貨之侵入而無内貨之輸出故除關税保護外。實無其他方法也此其二因是二者故關税保護本國産業。必尤要於工業不甚發達之國家。且自英國自倡英貨銷售於殖民地之説凡英殖民地之增加關税皆爲英貨計也今後各以其殖民地專視爲銷貨塲卒之昔之所謂通商者必至無商可通而止。</p>

<p>路透社十七日倫敦電倫敦海會工作、在本週内將以各總代表間非正式談話爲限、全體會議一時無召集之象、目前主要雜題、爲如何按照第一委員會所議定之種類、支配五强噸數一事、海會猶希望成立五强公約、英美間與英日間皆已有趨向此目的之進行、雖此三國尙未有協定、然前途已無荆棘、各代表所最縈念者、厥爲如法意間爭執所表示之歐洲大局此事無解决、則他事殆難進行、法國現知减少某噸數、以換取政治担保之無望、而意國依然不變其與歐陸最大海軍國同等之主張、時局遂愈形困難、上星期杪、英法代表之談話未涉及政治問題、可見法國已承認其自已地位、此後會務之進行、當然必以噸數爲根據、然此次討論、恐非短時間所能畢事也、本週内固未必有何大進步、惟在本週杪法總理泰狄歐</p>

<p>結果三比零</p>
<p>曁南與華樂之足球决賽昨日下午三時半、在中華棒球塲舉行、觀者達二千餘人　頗極一時之勝自始至終曁南取包襲壓迫勢　華樂因防禦鞏固上半時得保平安未分勝負下半時因周賢言與李寗退出後方單薄、被曁南連進三球成二與零之比錦標遂被曁南奪得、裁判員李思廉作戰情形略記如左</p>

<p>曁南首先開球、即取進攻步驟、華樂應付泰然、前十分鐘、勢頭相仿、互有迫射之機會、其後局面、稍趨平淡、旣而曁南威風凛凛、聲勢浩大、華樂球門、如成衆矢之的、但周賢言手術靈巧、終無一失、曁南打來打去、不得其門而人也、其間有兩次必勝機會、錯過爲惜、上半時畢、曁南零、華樂零、</p>

<p>陣地互易興趣頓减、蓋華樂李惠堂孫思敬、旣少用力、周賢言與李寗兩大將、又退出局外、球勢一落千丈、聽憑曁南攻打、華樂初則因犯規被罰十二碼戴麟經蹴之、撲擻一聲遂開紀録、不多時、童榮文與戴麟經、又相繼造成三比零結局、取得冠軍、</p>

<p>複賽　共有兩组、第一組鄭兆佳余田光對李組訓與郭競武、因李郭棄權、鄭余乃不勞而獲决賽權、第二組李惠堂劉鐵良、對梁永與鄺逸雲、結果李劉以六比二、六比一、六比二膳、得决賽權、</p>
<p>决賽鄭兆佳余田光與李惠堂　鐵良得决賽權俊、即休息十分鐘、開始交鋒、鄭余二人、年少英俊、球藝不凡、李劉雖屬老將、卒非其敵、然亦不肯示弱努力奮鬥、相戰劇烈、第一盤爲六比三、第二盤爲六比四、勝利均屬鄭余、現此比數、可知形勢尙見平均、第三盤一對少年、攻勢尤猛、李劉竟難招攔、而致一蹶不振、鄭余又六比一勝、奮得錦標、</p>

<p>女子網球雙打决賽、於昨日下午五時舉行、對賽者爲蒯淑平與李蓮對蘇祖琦與王大樂、四人球藝均佳表演頗有精彩、但以天晚未能終局、第一盤六比三、蘇王勝、第二盤六比三、蒯李勝、第三盤至五比二局數時、（蒯李佔優）天色已黑、不能再戰、惟今日亦不續賽、員會鑒於四人球藝精良、已决定均代表上海市、出席全國運動會云、兹將昨戰情形述後、</p>
<p>評球藝四人球藝、各有特長、就比較言、蒯淑平當居第一、抽球發球、急而有度、蘇祖琦之守欄、不可多得、發球亦甚急、王大樂亦不弱、惜少把握耳、李蓮女士最稱穏健、失分頗少、反手抽球、蒯李兩女士較爲穏當、總之四人之表演俱佳、頗得觀衆之讚美、</p>
<p>第一盤第一盤開始、由蒯先發發球、勝一局、而後蘇王之攻勢極盛、連下三局、以二比一佔先、惟蒯李並不示弱、奮力夾攻、李女士聲東接西、百不失一、蒯女士施勁抽撃、屢建奇功、蘇王頓見不支、造成各三之比、於是競爭愈烈、下局相戰多時、屢成平手、難判高下、忽見蘇之攔網與王之抽球、均甚準急、奪得此局、蘇王聲勢乃振、扶摇直上、以六比三勝第一盤、</p>

<p>昨日各界紀念「三一八」慘案</p>
<p>在市黨部開紀念大會</p>
<p>昨日上午九時、上海特别市黨部召集各機關·各民衆團體、在該别市黨部召集各行三一八慘案紀念大會、到各界代表三百餘人、由陳德徴主席、王進珊紀録、許也夫司儀、行禮如儀後、即由陳德徴報告三一八慘案之史實、及對於三一八紀念應有之努力、後即呼口號散會、兹將陳德徴之報告詞録下、</p>
<p>同各位志、今天是二一八紀念節、三一八紀今節的來源、大家都知道的、是民國十五年二月十八日、在北平發生的一樁慘案的紀念、在那年二三月間日帝國主義者、想壓迫中國北方的新興革命努力先在大沽口無理的砲轟撃、繼又聯合了辛丑和的的八國提出哀的美敦書、向段政府要求撤銷大沽口海防設備、停止一切對於外艦進口的干涉、這無異要支配中國北方的沿海防務是非常嚴重的問題倘若段政府承認了他則中國的主權將有很人的損失、因此全國民衆憤激萬狀尤其是北平市民恐怕段政府將在四十八小時内承認喪權辱國的八國最後通牒、因有二一八北平市代表同段政府請願的事件豈知段祺瑞不但不接受他們的請願　目族使衞隊開槍撃傷代表多人、這個消息傳遍北平全城後市民以及各校學生更形憤怒、二一八上午、在天安門舉行北平市民大會、　會後、羣衆遊行至鐵獅子胡同段之私邸要求段立刻駁復八國通牒段見民氣激昻老羞成怒、乃聽章七釗輩的獻策、令衞隊從民衆四面開槍掃射致死五六十人重傷七八十人、微傷者不計其數、成空前的大流血的慘案、這是二一八史實的人槪去年西湖博覽會中、在革命紀念館中、選有二一八當日的血痕陳列着給我們看從這種種悲慘的回憶裏我們知道第一個原因、實段之所以如是居然嗾使衛隊出槍而肇成慘案者乃是帝國主義壓迫中國的一種現象換言之也就是帝國主義者借北洋軍閥之手、實行施於中國革命民衆的屠殺第二、如帝國主義有屠殺中國民衆的　心、而北洋軍閥還有一點民族的血性的話、則應該早就　重駁斥八國的最後通牒了、軍閥政府爲要維持向氏衆的吮吸、爲要維持在當日把持着的地位故對於帝國主義者的一舉一動、無不順其意而爲之、帝國主義者要他怎様、他便怎様　所以帝國主義者要他做屠殺中國民衆的劊子手、於是他便實行、屠殺中國民衆了第三層意思是在帝國主義的壓迫與夫軍閥的兇殘以外還有幾件古裏古怪的事情在我們知道三一八羣衆所以要這様做的、使羣衆學生空手去衝　的乃是徐謙等的意思而他自已早知道在帝國主義的壓迫之下、段祺瑞必出之於屠殺的一途他就早早領着他的眷屬走到東洋交民巷去了如果他是真革命的便不應如此所以我們知道這種不過是借革命之名以號召羣衆實際乃是出賣革命出賣羣衆的上面幾點都是於二一八事實的幾層重要的原因和事實從這幾層中我們就得着下面的敎訓、第一個敎訓二一八事件的發生是帝國主義來破壞中國國民革命所以帝國主義之壓迫一日不已、則中國一日得不着自由平等、因此要求中國自由平等的實現則應遵照總理遺敎努力向帝國主義進攻三一八以後帝國主義壓迫中國、接二連三、有增無已、北則有俄帝國主義、東則有日帝國主義·西則有英帝國主義南則有法帝國主義四方八面許多帝國主義皆把他們的砲台、對着中國準備開放、他們是亳無善意之可言故我們也只有向一切的帝國主義努力進攻、第二個敎訓、三一八事件之發生、方面是帝國主義一方面也是軍閥獻媚帝國主義所致、我們要徹底的求中國自由平等還要根本的消滅北洋軍閥在民國十八九年中、北洋軍閥、此起彼仆不知多少、現在還有閻錫山等大大小小的軍閥餘孽聯合起來企圖擾亂國家、所以有北洋軍閥存在的一天中國也不能有自由平等的希望、故紀念二一八的慘案、更應痛心於北洋軍閥餘孽的依舊存在因紀念三一八慘案而要爲烈士們復仇我們只有在中央領導之下去根本消滅軍閥第三個敎訓三一八的事實、在帝國主義與北洋軍閥的罪惡以外、尙有機會主義者出賣革命的事實我們在革命進展的程序中不可不明瞭這一點自北伐軍克復了上海以後、也同様有很多機會主義者出賣革命、出賣羣衆的事實發生、如共産黨改組派一流都是用種種欺人的名義幹着破壞中國革命的勾當這種人物自三一八迄今繼續不斷的存在着我們來紀念三一八要保全整個的革命的光榮歷史我們便要滅這種假革命的勢力我們今天的紀念是很撲痛心的、譬如説革命軍到了三一八慘案的發生地點—北平—已經很久了而三一八殉難諸烈上的仇爲什麽還不能報復呢這就是因爲帝國主義依然繼續的壓迫着我國北洋軍閥餘孽還在不斷的進行着他們佔地盤蓄私兵的逑夢出賣革命的假革命反革命者的勢力不但尙未消滅仍然用着各種卑汚殘酷的手段阻撓着中國國民革命的成功這是在這個時期當中我們應該深切認識的所以希望我們的同忐知道一一八慘案的原因記取由三一八得來的敎訓遵守着總理遺敎在中央領導之下努力完成革命完了</p>

<p>— 戴孝忠</p>
<p>印度自國民黨領袖甘地積極厲行非武力抵抗政策以求印人之獨立與自由後。全球震撼。列强側目。頗惹世人注目。頃近印之聖地山格滿ＳＡＮＧＡＭＥ舉行浴節。萬人空巷。舉國若狂。參加人數。約三百五十萬左右。印人對於宗敎之狂熱。足見一斑。浴節中光怪陸離。五光十色。最近泰晤士報。記之頗詳。彌饒興趣。爰譯數則。以供讀者談助。</p>

<p>輓近畫家。往往發願畫佛。吳興錢病鶴其一也。病鶴之佛。佛端相異。一洗呆板之病。一日。作一佛端坐於菩提樹下。旣成。懸而凝視之。忽失笑。蓋酷肖笑匠徐卓呆也。知予與卓保常相往還。乃即題識其上。付諸裝池。倩予轉贈之。題句頗可誦。曰。旅滬三十年忽開異想。毫端説法。追悔旣往。政海浮沈。民事擾攘。因果循環。捷於影響。無處避秦。漁郎空仰。靜坐參禪。即遠塵網。戲摹尊容。裝成佛像。名士化身。古刹方丈。林密山深。體胖心廣。不值一笑。聊供清賞。</p>
<p>吳缶老晚年。頗享盛譽。即扶桑人士。亦以求得其尺幅爲榮。然缶老昔居吳下時。坎軻貧乏。歲暮謀斗酒隻雞以自慰。不可得。乃作一四尺中堂。魚一。雞一。豚蹄一。罎酒一。點染旣成。加以仿趣之題語。囑僕挾市賣之。得三金。購雞魚豚蹄罎酒。爲數適合。蓋其時物價較低。非近今所可比儗也。缶老一醉。酕醄直至元旦而醒。則家家爆竹已易歲序矣。缶老以爲生平唯一快事。與友好相談。頗喜述及之。</p>

<p>途中有標爲道館者。乃烟室也。此中大有道乎。名則雅矣。中人有營公賣烟室者。有業人力車者。買車與土人拉而收其税。亦有娼寮焉。有一大棚。標云中國男女技術團。有各種小賣。如廣州長堤畔有售竹製地牟牛者。放之。聲營營然。羣兒聚觀。店中樂器不少。吾甚望有人倡國樂會。從藝術上感化社會也。又有精武體育會。及他種體育會。若能從體育美術音樂上改造社會。效亦大矣。藥材店甚多。出售膏丹丸散參茸。而男女星相命課小館亦盛。有稱女道士相命者。按迷信之事。東西一律。上海徐家匯天主敎堂内。陳銅泥塑像。及各種五彩天堂地獄畫像甚多。全爲佛敎僧侣之變相。日本淺草觀音寺。占卦者以數十計。女卜士尤多。而法國日本無害於富强。今國内因此發生衝突之事亦不少。要當施行以序耳。</p>
<p>此地人十一時早飯。十二點午睡。二點以後起。但勞動者則難一定耳。下午參觀中國總商會之商品陳列所。規模可觀。此爲華僑之中心矣。</p>
<p>華僑普通家多供奉關公。大致初原於山西商人。山西商人滿天下。到處有關帝廟。即同時爲商</p>

<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>安特萊竇朗ＡＮＤＲＥＤＥＲＡＩＮ（一）</p>
<p>從瑞士回巴黎兩天以後的一晚。張弦兄及吳恒勤兄送來了四五份報紙。打開來看時。上面都載着ＩＵＥＤＵＦＡＯＢＯＵＲＧ八十三號ＢＥＵＪＥＵＩＭＪＥＩＵＮＥ畫堂展</p>
<p>覽雷諾亞ＨＥＮＩＯＲ塞尙ＣＥＺＡＮＮＥ瑪蒂斯ＭＡＴＪＳＳＥ竇朗。瑪提善尼ＭＯＥＩＧＲＩＡＮＩ五大作家的傑作的消息、老實説。這上面所載的名字。决不是我第一次見面。而用是我最親近的其先在日本時。看過他們種種的作品。但不能説是他們的極品。不過雷拿亞的顫動的肉體彣塞尙的色的音階。瑪蒂斯如野人般的裝飾趣味。我早就同情到十二分。</p>
<p>在於第二天的下午。我們就從ＨＯＴＥＬＤＥＳＦＡＣＣＵＬＴＥＳ坐着摩托車直到ＲＵＥＤＥＳＦＡ</p>
<p>ＵＢＯＵＲＧ八十三號ＢＥＵＪＥＵＪＭＵＥＮＥ畫堂去。這些稱爲畫堂。並不是美術館。僅是美術商人的商店。這八十三號是巴黎最大而且最有名的一家美術商店。主人ＢＥＵＪＥＮＵＩＭＪＥＵＮＥ從前專門搜集没有出名時的印象派幾位大師的作品。後來發了大財。直到現在還是算他的收藏獨富。所以我平時也常常到那裏去看畫。這一天。裏面人很多。我率然地走進去。在中央的第一室内左面一壁揭著的是雷拿亞的祼體畫。一共有十二張小幅。旁邊是他的靜物畫。再進去迎面一壁中間揭着一幅塞尙的「浴女」兩旁還有兩張「靜物」。以及「塞尙夫人的肖像」ＰＯＲＴＲＡＩＴＤＥＭＭＥＣＺＡＮＮＥＥ。這些傑作我在照相上也看見過。也收買到著色版的印刷品。想不到原作就在這裏。真是十二分惹起我的興味。立在那裏看看了很久。覺得他那色彩互有的嚴密的效果。在印刷物到底差得很遠。原物的神韵更有出於意表的不相同。再過去是八張瑪蒂斯的人物和靜物畫。那美艷鮮明的彩色。像到南洋看了光亮照耀的風物一様的剌戟。他真能得到色彩的裝飾底機能了。在右面的一壁就是竇朗的作品了。在這一室他有十四福大作。中間揭着一幅一百號那様大的人物畫。就是他最有名的傑作「歌者」ＡＲＩＥＱＵＩＮＥＴＰＪＥＲＲＯＴ左旁也是一幅大畫是「裸體臥婦」。右旁是他一千九百十九年所作的「希臘婦人」ＦＥＭＭＥＧＲＥＣＯＱＵＥ其餘二幅風景一幅「花」還有六幅「肖像」。這實在是許多名畫中最可注意的。看過之後。逐漸再走到裏面去。中間又最陳列着竇朗的一幅很大的「靜物。」晝着的是許多灶竈用的器具。旁邊一塊大麵包。這畫兩旁還有他許多素描。又其旁邊。是瑪提善尼的畫。這幾位大師的畫競爭地相對陳列著。大槪是因爲他們都有相承的畫風而又有特别創作的巨人。把他們揭在一起。可以使人認識了幾位新時代的祖師。而其中現在生存着的瑪蒂斯和竇朗兩位。尤其是掌握着現代歐洲藝術系統的霸權的人。在這裏有這様許多名畫。但其中尤其惹目的。還是幾張最大的竇朗的畫。他的色調是很强烈的。他汲取高爾佩ＣＯＩＲＢＥＴ的堅實。塞尙的崇高。黑人的渾樸。峨特式的苦悶。他對於作畫並無預定的計劃。昨日所作。今日也許棄置。或者有興味了明日又繼續起來。他熱愛不描。更愛天真的東西。他愛用黑色。就是用緑色的時候。也是極暗的。至於用藍色時常像鋼色那様深。他的白色呢。真是白到雪那様白。而予以幾點煙煤。描寫肉感多用赭色。他那畫面的起伏。是一種有力有旋律。他畫靜物的時候。没有一點虚飾。都是日常所用的簡陋或破壞的東西。一只没有脚的酒杯。或者一只飯碗。一串殘餘的葡萄。一方敝壞的餐布。是他的畫面時時習見的。他是要于已班剥的東西中間招出一種情緒來。這位巨人。他是現在活着。非常愛惜生命的。他是絶對不能受人束縛着的。更不爲物質所役使他是以獨立的生命來直訴現象的視覺。他是現代藝人中唯一的能够繼續中世紀藝術作風的人。同時他更先滿着活的現代的情神。</p>

<p>茉莉</p>
<p>南非洲的組魯人、ＺＵＬＵＳ是一種好鬥的民族、雖則現在已經漸漸地開化、但這種好勇鬥很的習氣、却始終保存、尤其是五六歲的孩子、和十餘歲的青年人、最使我們驚異而又感覺興趣的、就是他們青年男女的求愛方法、美國哈理司大佐夫婦、新近到非洲去游獵、把組魯民族的奇異習俗、作了一個很詳細的報告、我們讀了、覺得和親自到非洲去走了一趟差不多、其中有許多特異的事情、都是我們意想不到的、如今譯在下面、</p>
<p>（一）戰鬥的盛行我們早知道南洲的組魯人、是歷史上最喜歡爭鬥的民族、但這次我們到非洲、和他們厮混了幾個月、知道士人和土的的戰爭、却並不很多、戰爭的利器、他們用的也不是槍、也不是刀、却是末端有骨節的木棍、而且這種木棍、常常像我們擲標槍一様的擲到敵人的頭顱上去、如果没有和組魯人厮混過的、决不會橈得這種木棍是怎様的形狀、但我們可以想像、這種木棍、是非常堅硬的木頭做的、當土人用力擲過來的時候、被擲的雖則不會倒地、但頭上吃了一棍、無論怎様、是要昏迷得不省人事、等到他回醒轉來、想飛步逃走的時候、那得勝的、就要在後面拚命的狂追、如果不幸給他捉着了、那末、第二次的受苦、比第一次還要厲害、因爲這時候、得勝的人、心裏滿存着勝利的念頭、所以不把他打得死去活來、是不肯休歇的、美國有句俗語、不要再去打已經給你打倒的人、在組魯人看來、簡直不生效力、</p>
<p>年紀大的人、捨不得讓這種好勇鬥很的精神、漸漸地消失、所以常常在那裏駡年青的男女、逼着他們拚命地去鬥、小孩們怎様地去擲木棍、做父母的都要盡心訓練、像不能走路的小孩、就要給他們柔軟的樹枝、敎他們用樹枝來摔打、等到可以行走了、就敎他們凡有不遂心的事、就要用樹枝來打人、到了八九歲的時候、所用的樹枝、也漸漸加大起來、到十餘歲就要用和成人一様的木棍、不過比較輕巧一點吧了、如果有兩個小孩子吵起嘴來、他們的父母就拿出木棍來、呌他們打過明白、誰勝了、就誰點上風、萬一兩個小孩子、打了整半天、還是不分勝敗、那末、他們的父母、就暫假定一個是勝利的、呌他們息爭、但約定第二天的晚上、還要再戰、這是給那個輸的一個勝利的機會、所以第二次戰爭、比第一次還要凶很、</p>
<p>（二）男子的求愛這種拚命的鬥很、就在他們的家庭生活裏、也時常有的、有時甚至於引用到求愛上去、講到求愛、在組魯女子的眼光裏、並不算一椿怎様浪漫的事情、如果她身體上的發育、已達到某種顯著的表示的時候、約摸總在十歲左右、就要賣給她未來的丈夫了、倘若她父母願意早結一門親、她一出世、就可以賣掉的、這様賣來買去、直是一種貨品、但僥倖得很、她夫家不到她長到十七歲、是不來娶的、组魯女子、對於男子的選擇機會、是很少的、當然、求愛的男子、要用十分熱力來引誘她、在求愛的時候、他披着一張美麗的獸皮、和許多裝飾品、最重要的、是一個</p>
<p>籐牌、三根本棍、三枝長槍、他這種形狀、給近代的歐洲人看了、一定要當他發瘋、我</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>因爲他隨身掛的幾隻袋裏、充滿着幾許不易得到的寳貝、他以爲他的情人、看了這些寳貝、一定會愛上他的、他那兩隻手、可真忙極了、除了上面所講的物品之外、他一隻手、還要拿着一把黑傘、雖則這把傘、無論是有炎熱的太陽、或傾盆的大雨、他總是不張開的、另一隻手、又要拿着一把像和合琴那一類的樂器、有時弄起這種樂器來、那種聲音鳴鳴地使人駭怕、</p>
<p>他的腰帶上、又掛着小刀、鼻煙壺、和其他古怪的東西、這些裝飾品、全是買來的、如果他還有錢、他還要買一條五彩的浴巾、披在肩膊上這様打扮齊全了、他才得意洋洋地向情人求愛去了、如果他這種睫武的體態、富有的表現、還不能打動情人的心弦、撩撥情人的愛火、他便要繼續努力、但他這種努力、不似歐洲人用那種温存的體貼來得她的歡心、他却一味蠻幹、到這時候、他便走上前去、拿出一根木棍來、向情人的身上亂敲亂打、直到她痛得受不住了、才立誓要熱烈的愛他、他才停止、如果女的一見了他地種英雄的體態、立刻表出愛悦、她便摘下幾顆串珠、和一副手鐲來送給他、那時候、兩個人就嘴吻嘴地擁抱着去了、</p>
<p>組魯民族、又有分期付欵買老婆的辦法、這裏所謂欵却並不是欵、因爲没有一個相當的字來代替他、如果一個男人、愛上了一個女子、無論她是多大的年紀、祗要他自已的父親同意了、就可以拿四頭牛來買她、倘若這個女子、祗有四五歲、那末這四頭牛就等於我們買貨的定洋、等到她長大了、他再付她兩頭牛、直等她到可以結婚的年齡、—十七歲、他還</p>
<p>要再付四頭、這様、他應付的欵、已經分期付足他的老婆也就到手了、</p>
<p>話雖如此、如果你已經付了兩次欵、而同時還有一個人、他的需要比你還要緊急、那末、照他自已父親的意見、他可以把欵一次付足、或者比你所付　　　些、這樣他便可以把那女子買去、　堯、</p>
<p>人財兩失、當然是不會的、至少你所　的欵、可以如數　還、但便希望加倍奉度、這種弄下去、三角式的戀愛、是常職生的、有時男子在結婚前的一夜、一還不曉得他老婆在那裏呢、</p>

<p>— 芸之</p>
<p>是一個初春的多雨的黄昏時候、弄堂裏賣廣東包子的低長音、已經和着細而激的雨聲合奏着弄堂交響曲、像這様的惱人天氣、簡直悶得使人發慌了、</p>
<p>前樓上佳着三個青年、正和着一個從江灣來的朋友激烈地辯論着、Ｍ一面埋頭寫什麽、一面挿幾句打諢、Ｌ臉紅紅的漲着青筋、揮舞着兩拳大聲地、而且興奮地和從江灣來的Ｓ爭論着、Ｃ是本來導火線的第一人、他是站在Ｌ的對手方面的、他時常補足Ｓ的話、他們都似乎忘乎其形了、</p>
<p>無論怎麽様説、克萊拉寳是代表資本主義底糜爛時期的、她有肉的美、她有醉人的媚眼、和熱烈的ＫＩＳＳ、她是美國現今文明的唯一代表：：「Ｓ説、</p>
<p>一要是克萊拉寳能够代表美國現今的文明、那末資本主義的罪惡、只不過造成一個克萊拉寳、與反資本無涉、可是世　爲什麽恐慌着資本主義呢、克萊拉寳只不過契國資本的好萊塢底罪惡的表現而已、」L接着說、</p>
<p>Ｃ在休息了「會之後、現時再也不能忍耐了、像爆發的富士火山似的搶着説」我歡迎着資本主義、因爲資本主義的力、誰也不能抵抗的、機械的飛轉、人類文化的激變、都是資本主義的結果、譬如紐約的ＪＡＺＺ不是上海也變了影響嗎、如果現在還有人反對械、反對都會的ＪＡＺＺ的</p>
<p>只好隨着葉前寗（俄國詩人自殺者）去變鬼去、</p>
<p>拿着筆的Ｍ這時是第四次發言了、、「我不反對資本主義、我也不反對ＪＡＺＺ、可是我反對克萊拉寳、她並不如Ｓ和Ｃ所説那様的偉大、她有肉的美、會ＫＩＳＳ、粗强、這些是否就能代表美國文明、還是疑問、因爲譬如最近上演的ＴＡＬＫＹＩＤＡＮＧＥＲＡＵＲＮＵＲＶＥ克萊寳在裏面所表現的有什麽、倒不如她從前在ＲＥＤＨＡＩＲ中還更肉感呢、她頂多能够表現現時由資本主義所造成的美國女性罷了、」</p>
<p>「不、我們知道現代文明的兩大主潮的代表者、俄羅斯與美利堅、而這兩大文明衝撃着全世界、谁也不能抵抗、而克萊拉寳恰就是資本主義型的女性、她無疑義地是美國文明的化身、而克萊拉寳就在她身上把一切都暴露着、「Ｃ説、</p>
<p>「可是、克萊拉寳雖然可以代表美國女人之一部分、但她並不是可有像你所崇拜的那様偉大、她是當然的現象、並且和你那種迷信是不適合的、」Ｌ説、</p>
<p>Ｓ説、「不、一個演員能够用她的才力把一個社會的型式在舞臺上或銀幕上表現出來、她當然就很偉大、」</p>
<p>「自然、有技術的演員、她能够表現出某種型的社會、這種演員可以算是很成功、但她不是偉大、因爲藝術的成功和偉大、並非一個人的力量、尤其是戲劇與電影、牠們是多方面的综合、克萊拉寳假使長於表演、只不過是一個藝術製作所裏的工人、崇拜迷信有什麽好處、况且她是否成功、還待我們的仔細批判呢、Ｍ説、</p>
<p>「熱呵」ｓ大聲地答、</p>
<p>「是的」Ｃ斷續著説、「熱、熱就是現代文化之源泉、一切機關ＪＡＺＺ、都要熱、熱就是我們該崇拜的、不了解克萊拉寳的、不配是摩登的青年、」Ｃ真有激昻起來、</p>
<p>「好、好、」Ｓ拍着手大聲呌着、　　Ｌ氣着了、「不准談克萊拉寳、要談的滚出去」、</p>
<p>「偏要談、偏要談」、Ｓ和Ｃ齊聲説、</p>
<p>「滚出去」、Ｌ真的有些氣了、</p>
<p>「喂、喂、喂」Ｍ丢開筆站起來、兩手一揎「不要説了吧、先生們、難道你們不　　覺得肚子餓了麽」、</p>
<p>「不准説」Ｌ再補上一句、</p>
<p>「對哪、你們在這兒辯着克萊拉寳、要上給克萊拉寳知道了」、Ｍ向着Ｓ向Ｃ説、「她會給你們每人一個響的ＫＩＳＳ、像在（曲線戀愛）上面那様的」Ｍ又轉向Ｌ、「同時要是克萊拉寳在你面前來和你接吻一下、你也就不會反對了吧、</p>

<p>廿四個汽缸之汽車丁祖澤</p>
<p>英國著名賽率家凱唐ＫＡＹＥＤＯＮ現爲謀奪一九三○年汽車速度世界紀録起見</p>
<p>。特製一偉大汽車定名曰銀彈號（ＳＩＪＶＥＲＢＵＬＬＥＴ）。。此番比賽。爲期已邇。仍將在美國福禄利達省台登那海濱賽塲舉行云</p>
<p>銀彈號賽車。狹長似一鯨魚。兹示其狀態如附圖圖中已剖去外壳一半内部機械完全呈露。Ａ爲冰質散熱器Ｂ與Ｃ爲連續之發動機兩具。每具有十二隻汽缸。爲英國昇平汽車廠所製。Ｄ爲摧汽機。Ｅ爲化油器Ｅ爲轉向機。Ｇ爲廢汽管。Ｈ爲舵尾。Ｊ爲水喞筒。Ｋ爲連合曲軸。Ｌ爲進汽管。Ｍ爲分合機。Ｍ爲傳動軸。爲齒輪箱。</p>
<p>此車全長三十呎。濶四十四吋。長度似可驚奇。然以其闊度與高度甚小。驟視之幾無人得悉其内容機力之偉大。</p>
<p>前軸與後軸。皆懸於半橢圓彈簧之下。彈簧之形式雖與平常汽車相似。但鋼片異常闊傳且其上下彈　之距離。最大祇有一時。蓋因欲保持高速度進行中。車輪不致歪動也</p>
<p>發動機係兩具十二只汽缸者。連續在一直綫上。每一具發動機。兩側各具汽缸六只。成Ｖ字形。每一汽缸有四個汽門。分四角位置於汽缸頭上。出汽門進汽門各二個在四個汽門之中心爲火星塞。啓閉汽門之偏心輪軸、則位置在汽缸頂上而由發動機首端傳達動力以運轉之。曲軸上各個軸承。均用鋼柱軸承、故可使之每分鐘逈轉至四千轉。每一發動機重約一千磅。能發生二千匹馬力。計之機體每半磅發生一匹馬力實爲工程界最大之新供獻</p>
<p>現今高速度發動機無不採用摧汽機。以</p>
<p>增大其馬力。此銀彈號亦然且所裝之摧汽機頗大。係大直徑之離心式。由兩具化油器吸入油汽。而以高壓力吹入汽缸。兩具發動機雖連屬一體但其曲軸並不直接運成一直綫、而在此二曲軸之下。另設一軸。用齒輪轉達動力於下軸。下軸之速度。比曲軸快一倍。據稱如此結構。可免却曲軸直接受進時之扭力云。</p>
<p>銀彈號汽車預備每小時行二百至三百哩之高速。以如此之高速度。其制動機自必十分安全。方可免危險。故制動　之構造。乃極新奇。每一制動輪。係將重約四百</p>
<p>磅之鋼塊。切削爲四十五磅重之銅碗。即此一端。已可見其製造時之慎重。制動機之施用。以液壓力驅策之。並防其發高熱。則復設有水冷却裝置。</p>
<p>車身之形態爲避免風阻力起見。無處不用水流線式、不特如是車身之底部且完全密閉、將内部機件皆掩蔽之。蓋備一旦衝入海中（按前年美國賽車家洛克哈脱氏嘗被海浪捲入海中。旋被海浪撃返海濱。尙可藉以浮行也。駕駛座前則蔽以堅厚之鎳鋼屏。兼防發動機失火之延燒與碰撞時駕駛人不致被壓入云。</p>
<p>全車各處之結搆。可稱包羅人類所能思慮之一切。如尾舵之用以防前進之歪斜。汽油箱之位置在駕駛座後。使之完全避去發動部之熱力。不克盡舉。</p>
<p>按汽車速度之世界紀録。逐年增加、最近之三年。錦標之奪得者皆屬英國。如一九二八年。爲英國康培爾氏造成。其速度爲二百十四哩七九七賽車名青鳥。一千匹馬力。一九二九年屬英國西格來夫氏。速度達二百三十一哩三六。賽車名金翦。亦有一千匹馬力。本年度之銀彈賽車有四千匹馬力。其成績必可觀也。</p>

<h3 id="c268">汽車營業的科學觀程志政 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>失敗不出十二點分析後易於改良</p>
<p>現代是科學世界。一切一切。都趨重於科學。而辦事營業。也都以科學方法爲鵠的。所謂科學方法。意義是很廣泛的。但總結而槪括説。科學方法。就是做事有秩序。能分析。在營業上。尤其是分析。最關重要。在功時須要研究何以成功。失敗時便要研究何以失敗。尋出失敗的原因。再加以研究。加以改良。事業自然可以發皇起來了。却説汽車事業。占近代工商業的偉大優越地位。他的經營營管理。尤其要能利用科學方法。最近汽車週報上。刊載汽車營業失敗的十二原因。分析得異常清楚。可以作一般經營汽車事業的帮助。因此把這篇文章譯下來。</p>
<p>（一）業務工作不努力用科學方法去觀察用人問題。第一個就是研究的效率。所以工作一分鐘而有效率的。價值比工作一刻鐘而無效率的更大。汽車公司要是不注意到這一層。不設法來增進效率。失敗是毫無疑義的。因此凡看出工作人員不努力時。應設法加以改善。改善的方法也狠心。如分紅費。分股制等等都是。如何運用。本文此刻暫不討論。</p>
<p>（二）機器不佳有些汽車公司爲貧便宜起見。買舊機器來使用。結果所出的貨物品質太劣。所供給的服務成績太差。生意便不免日漸的黯澹下來。還有些公司。機器雖是買新的。但是不善選擇。或是專擇價廉的。於是也就生用同様的結果了。</p>
<p>（三）智的廣告在經營汽車事業上。最不可省的就是一筆廣告費。可是同様登廣告。甲公司和乙公司所收的效果却不同。也許甲公司多耗了錢。然而效果反不及乙。所以廣告不是隨便可登的。要研究那一種報章和雜誌銷路最大。那一種廣告最引人注目。可以得最大的效果。却費最經濟的金錢。這一點。看來似乎狠小。然而公司成敗的關建键。却完繋在這上面。許多公司的虧蝕。即是不善登廣告的影響。</p>
<p>（四）經營時不善選擇業務美國各地的汽車服務公司狠多。他們所經營的業務。自然也各個不同。或是洗車。或是潤車。在未開設以前。便應當就專長的那幾門而加以選擇。不可誤選貧多。因爲工作一多。頭緒就紛繁。工作不專長。指揮就難如意。所生的效率。更是極微。因之選擇業務。必須十二分的慎重。</p>
<p>（五）資本不足或太多資本要看經營範圍的廣狹而定。範圍廣的。資本少了須不能周轉。範圍小的。資本大了徒然是損錢利。善於商業的人。目光對此最靈敏。什麽時候要增加資本。什麽時候要减少。都可適合其需要。而不濫費。而且對於金融市塲。尤須預爲之計。免得臨渴掘井。資本要出狠大的利息去貸借。這種初而明之。當然是存乎各人的。</p>
<p>（六）作無謂的競爭　無謂競爭。也是失敗的主因。所謂「斷頭競爭」ＣＮＴＴＢＲＯＡＴＣＯＷＰＥＴＩＴＩＯＮ）旣傷和策。又要虧本。是萬萬不可存在的。即使一地方的同行多。也應當將價格劃一議定起來。這纔是正理。而且以廉價博顧客歡心。在顧客方面。也未必歡迎。因爲一來他們希望的祗是好的服務。價錢高些。祇要服務好。他們是不問的。反之。價錢過低。他們一定要懐疑到服務的不良。貨物不精了。</p>
<p>（七）無信用標準營業而放賬。這本是極普通的事。但也要注意到這人的信用標準如何。如平他無信用。而你放出狠大的欵項。結果下來。錢是收不到。而自已的資本。都受了莫大的影響。作繭自縛。斃將自焚。這又何苦呢。</p>
<p>（八）小營業太多什麽小營業呢。就是主顧多半爲小生意。大生意却很少。結果手續多而人工增。所得的酬勞。不能合算。所以公司在招攬的時候。要注意大主顧。多有一個大主顧。少却十個小主顧也是值得的。</p>
<p>（九）兜攬員效率工作人員的注重效率。自然是無庸疑義的。我們在上面也已詳述過了。不過在外兜攬的人員。也要施以同様的注意。可是内部人員可以每天稽核。在外人員。却不容易處置。因爲鞭長莫及。稽察無從。但可就各人的成績來推算各人的效率。而定去留。　果用的人都是效率狠你的。自然啦。公司怎様生意好呢。</p>
<p>（十）營業無計劃營業　計劃。自然也難以賺錢。譬如對於顧　。如果是售車商。那麽。試乘啦。接洽啦。種種手續。總要有預定的計劃。如果是服務公司。那麽期要修理加油等。都要當時提醒顧客。以免自已的生意。爲他人奪去。内部計劃定好。一切進行。都可異常順利了。</p>
<p>（十一）冗員多資本要與營業範圍大小成比例。上面已略微説過了。而用人問題。正也是如此。如果事務有阴。而用了許多人員。當然是要失敗的。普通一般公司。也喜歡官署裏似的安挿私人。結果效率得不到。無謂的消耗。却已足促公司的壽命了。</p>
<p>（十二）不研究顧客不來的原因顧客是公司的生命的滋養者。他們的地位。在公司眼光中。應當異常重視的。在精明的營。業者。必要將顧客的姓名地址。詳細的録下。一方去增加新顧客。一方去維持老顧客。一旦老顧客不來。即刻要研究不來的原因。以謀補救。倘使公司對於這些重要事件。不去注意。又那能失敗呢。</p>
<p>營業失敗的理由和補救方法。分析得已狠詳盡了。在新年各公司準備擴充營業的當兒。我敢以十分誠意供獻這幾點。也許對於營業上。多少可以得些助力吧。</p>

<p>車之始。非不平穏。但經長時間之往來。由高而低。轉側不舒矣。斯時而言保養。則費工旣鉅。甚不弳濟。最好路工隊之阻織。分修路養路二組。若路組以少數之工人。管理若干里之路段。分段當值。巡視以。如路面發見轍跡。或有損傷。立即填補。俾復原狀。迄至路面材料。無可再養時。始由修路組添料重修。俾成完整之路。而後再行養路之法。庶乎其可耳。近頃公路之建築。以澆鋪柏油之所费過巨、大抵以碎石路與砂士路二者最爲普通。因之保養之方。亦異其趣。據一般人之觀察。以爲路壞之原因。撮其大要。不外二端。一爲天氣損壞。如風吹雨洗。冰霜侵害之類是也。一爲機械損壞。如車輪軋壓。馬蹄踐踏之類是也。而説者又謂壞於天氣者百分之二十。破於機輪者。百分之八十。此僅路面言之也。吾謂或則宣戰洩不良。路基　濕。或則飽和水分。路基軟陷</p>
<h2>Page 29</h2>
<p>者。是亦員　損壞公轟公轟之大原因也。其保養之法。宜採用巡工制。巡工者僱用長期工人。專司養路之謂。當於指定路段。係長若干里。是工人數名。以工頭帶領之。每日巡行明轄路段。見有損傷。立即如法墊平。工人巡視路面。每日至少二人。此法各國行之。均獲美滿之效果。兹將碎石路與砂士路保養方法。分别言之。</p>
<p>碎石路之保養法約有十八項（一）</p>
<p>路面不平。或現車轍。有存水情形者。即用碎石修補。俾復原狀。（二）路之中部。應常高於兩旁。成抛物淺形式。（三）受傷輕微之路。即刨挖修後。不添碎石。（五）路面刨挖之部分。應爲圓形。不得成鋭角式方角。（五）刨挖之深。不得小於石塊之最大徑。）六（全部刨修之路。應先刨中部。修復後。再及兩旁。（七）路面不得棄置石塊。（八）不能通過一寸半篩孔之碎石。不得應用。（九）碎石每塊之重。不得超過五兩。（十）作粘料之石末。應除去有機物質。（十一）路面應常洒水。（十二）溝渠涵洞内。及橋梁下。如有穢物渣滓。雜草樹枝。應常清除。（十三）涵洞及橋梁之路端。如有小樹深草。妨碾行人。及駕駛人視線者。應即除去。（十四）旁溝有漬水水處。應即疏濬。（十五）橋梁涵洞。里程牌警告牌。公路叚房等。有損壞之處。應即修理。（十六）依照取締重車規則。實行收籍。（十七）　　路旁橋木。</p>
<p>砂土路之保變法約有十四項。（一）路</p>
<p>面不平。成現車轍之處。應用砂土填平。拍壓堅實。俾復原狀。（二）路之中部。應常高於兩旁。成抛物緑形。（三）路面上不得棄置石塊。（四）雨後路函發軟。並起粘性。泥土附車輪者。爲砂少之證。立用推器推平。铺沙一層。（五）晴天路面乾燥。有鬆散情形者。爲砂多之證。應俟雨後。用推器推平。鋪土一層。（六）使用推器。須與路之中線。成四十五度之角。並由路邊向路中推刮。（七）路面應用灑水。（八）補路所用之砂土。其成分應輿原路之成分相同。或使之相同。（九）如溝渠涵洞内。及橋梁下。有穢物渣滓。樹枝雜草。應常清除。（十）如涵洞及橋梁之兩端。有小樹深草。能妨礙行人。及駕駛人視線者。應即除去。（十一）旁溝有積水之處。應即疏濬。（十二）橋梁涵洞。里程牌。警告牌。公路段房等。有損壞之處。應即修理。（十三）依照取締重車規則。實行取締。（十四）保護路旁樹木。</p>
<p>以上兩種保養公路方法。按之河北省政府建設廳。曾有詳細之論列。兹復參以已意。以供各地興修公路者之注意及之。俾知公路之不難於築造之始。而難於築成以後之應如何保養。以期久遠而節經費云。</p>

<p>交通之暢塞。關乎國勢之盛衰。入其境。田野闢。道路治。則知其國力强富。文化發皇。反之則國貧民弱。不問而知。蓋　道路之於國家、猶脈絡之於身軀。百脈貫通而體力自强。路網繁密而國勢自盛。覘國者不待深求細究。於此已可得其槪要矣。美利堅以新大陸後起之國。不二百年而雄視寰宇。富甲列邦。推原其故。雖有種種主因。而亦交通發達。富源盡啓。有以致之。查美國道道路制度。共分國道·州道·縣道·村道·數種。就國道而言。統計四十八州之地。約有路綫十八萬九千英里之長。已經改良完成者約七萬八千英里。經緯萬端。密織如網。運輸便捷。冠於全球。每歲</p>
<p>國定經費爲七千五百萬元。分配各州。以作建築國道之用。現在胡佛總統鑒於各州道路雖甚發達。猶有改良擴充之必要。原有經費。已感不足。須將路費預算增</p>
<p>加。特與各州政府協議經濟合作之方。蓋現據全國公路局報告。去年之築路里程。較往歲短縮。若不增加經費。則所有修築計畫之進行。將不復如前數年之迅速。緣前此之所以能照預定步驟進行者。由於早年之築路費未經全用。歷年餘積甚豐。有此鉅欵。始能促成過去數年中路政之突飛猛進。今則所儲告罄。工料復昻。僅恃常年經費。實不敷用。故其結果因受限制而减縮。欲謀道路之迅速進展。非增加經費不爲功。中央政府因此乃有與各州協籌路費之計畫現在各州行政長官已多數允從。儘力贊助。惟發展道路最大之原動力。則仍惟中央是賴也。關於增加道路經費之具體運動。已由國會議員提出國道歲費增至一萬二千五百萬元之議案。如果遹過。則今後路政之趨勢。將復形猛進矣。據美國汽車恊會預算。一九三零年度之全國道路與市街建築費及修養費。將超過二十五萬萬元。需用工役可達六十二萬五千人之多。果爾則必更有驚人成績表現於世。固可斷言。兹將該會所作各州之國道統計。截至一九二九年秋季止。列表於後。以見美國路政發達之一斑。</p>

<p>中國公共汽車營業狀况林英楣</p>
<p>中國公共汽車公司於二月二十五日大沙遜房子該公司總經理辦公處。舉行股東年會。由董事長阿諾德（ＨＥＡrnhold）主席。報告過去一年中之營業狀况。兹將阿諾德君之演詞譯録於后。</p>
<p>在審查去年賬務之前。鄙人先有數點報告諸君。想亦爲諸君所樂聞也。過去一年中公司營業發展之急速。爲創辦以來未有之盛况。南輛陸續添加。迄今已有九十八輛之多。將來巨大擴充計劃。尙在積極進行之中。一俟新車加入駛行。早晚擁潮當能應付。蓋增設車輛。方便乘客。以免除擁擠。爲公司一貫之政策。此外如行駛雙層車輛。亦爲减少擁擠之另一方法。現已定製三輛。以便試行。交通之擁擠雜沓。世界各大都市大致似。不足爲奇。設有交通機關。不問其性質爲汽車或電車。在地上或地下。爲乘客舒服起見。常備額外車輛及人員。使早晚急時亦無擁擠之虞。則其日常經費之浩大。勢非增加車資不可。公司車輛行駛哩數。已較前年增加百分之六十。故不得不增添養車設備。以資應付。已將原有車塲加以擴充。並在康腦脱路二六三號新造辦公室。蓋舊有房屋。因營業發展。不敷應用。</p>
<p>公共汽車事業非逐年推廣擴充。不足以應社會之需要。今年新車到滬。尙待續建房屋。以資保護。蓋公司對於車輛之維持供養。非常注意。而全體職員。亦能努力從公。故車兩阻損等情。若以行駛平均哩數推算。較之英國著名各公司。殆無遜色。</p>
<p>故障事件</p>
<p>意外故障爲辦理交通事業之日常危險及懸念。實無法避免之。公司對此。特别注意。務使故障事件愈少愈妙。幸頼高級人員之同心協力。一年以來成効頗有可觀。去年故障事件共計四·九二六起（前年爲四·二二七起）惟其中大部均係細微事故。蓋不問事之大小鉅細。有則必録也。公司僱用之車夫均係經騐豐富之輩。其中有在職二年。而絶未肇事者。且公司償罰嚴明。功則給奬。過則加緊訓練。以减少事故。提高能率。</p>
<p>勞工狀况</p>
<p>去年公司未過任何性質之勞工糾紛。此</p>
<p>層殊值報告。又前年報告書中所述之華職員養老金。今已儲積至二萬三千餘兩。公司與職員之感情。尙屬滿意。公司對於職員之意見。遇有陳述時。不問其職司之高低。無不予以考慮或接受。全體職員均能勤奮稱職。受董事會及總理之指揮。以發展公司之營業。其成功之程度。可由去年盈虧表中窺見之。</p>
<p>賬務</p>
<p>各種賬務報告送達諸君。已有多日。兹不贅述。去年純盈爲一○一·六三四·四三兩。乃如表中所示。想各位早已見及。加上前年結存一三·八三八·五四兩。合計一一五·四七二·九七兩。以供分配。</p>
<p>董事等擬提出九厘作爲股息。以資本額百萬兩計元。需除去九萬兩。復擬將「股票增額」項下之尾數七一·二九四·八五兩。轉入「信用」「擴充」二項。再由「盈虧」項下提取七·五○五·一五兩。以冲銷上述二項。所餘結存純利一七·九六七·八二兩轉入新賬。公司資本已由七○三·○○○兩增至百萬兩。所剩二九·七○○股。均以票價十兩出售。惟每股外加增額二兩五錢。結果「股票增額」項增至七一·二九四·八五兩。</p>
<p>車輛車胎折舊基金。亦有增加。似無不足之虞。惟自原有車輛購入後。匯價忽告暴落。則賬上之折舊額不啻更少於替換成本。另星債户賬業已完全算清。所發票據略較前年稍加。</p>
<p>資産</p>
<p>資産方面。信用一項增加二五·八○○兩。其中二二·○○○兩。係付與原特許人。根據合約之規定。特許人得無價購取公司股票一萬股。照票價計算。故不如總付一次。以換此捨取之權。此外三千兩一筆。係接收支路之欵。該路自接收以來。營業頗稱發達。擴充賬毫無變更。現擬與信用賬一同冲销。已如上述。土地賬未動。房屋賬增加九四·一八五。○八兩。頃已説明理由。車輛總值爲九一六·九一三·四四兩。均以實價計算。與此對峙之拆舊基金。則爲二四六·三七二兩。物料存貨增至一一一·六三四·四三兩。另星</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>全部收　其尙未付情者　　　能力不足爲慮。安利洋行所欠一四七·○五八·八九兩。係公司之流動餘欵。歸該行以銀行資格保管者將來可由股息中扣除之或囑該行代購新車。同時該欵收入利息頗佳。</p>

<p>各項營業統計枯燥乏味。一時亦不及詳述不如略舉數點。較爲扼要明顯。想亦爲諸君所藥聞也。去年公司車輛行駛三百五十萬哩。載客三千三百餘人。耗費汽油七十五萬加倫。車資收入包括銅元二五五○噸。售出車票長合一千哩。綜觀一切。斯業前途方興未艾也。</p>

<p>were inventoried by the 125th Brigade. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Shanxi side dispatched Sun Yuji, director of the Baoding Telephone Bureau, to take over the Telecommunications Administration Bureau, and dispatched Sun Xujin to take over the Telephone Bureau. Various other agencies, such as the wireless radio, were also taken over separately. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>

(2) Yan Xishan originally intended to hand over the various units of the Shanxi Army to Feng Yuxiang to command them to move south, while he himself would go abroad to implement his plan. However, fearing that he would be overtaken by Feng, he appointed Feng as Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, ordering him to lead his troops east and invade the Pinghan line, while the Shanxi Army concentrated on the Tianjin-Pukou line with the aim of capturing Shandong and Jinan. (3) According to reliable reports, Feng Yuxiang returned to Shaanxi, and Yan presented him with 1,000 portable machine guns and 500,000 yuan. (4) The Shanxi Army's Zhang Huizhao, Yang Xiaou, Yang Yaofang, and Feng Pengzhu's divisions have completed their assembly and are ready to move within days. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>

(Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The second general meeting of the National Training Conference</p>
<p>passed a motion to expel Yan Xishan from the Party. The original proposal text is as follows: Since Yan Xishan issued absurd circular telegrams, he knew that he was intolerable to the people of the country. He falsely claimed to go abroad, but in reality, he still occupied Shanxi. Recently, he allowed the rebel Feng Yuxiang to enter Shaanxi and held secret military meetings in Shanxi, commanding troops to move south in an attempt to overthrow the Party and the country and undermine unification. The signs of rebellion are clear. It is requested that the Central Committee expel Yan from the Party and issue a clear order to punish him in order to uphold national law and demonstrate Party discipline.

<h3 id="e14">Countries Use Tariffs to Protect Their Own Industries <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The global economy is exhausted. There is an oversupply of goods, and competition in industry and commerce is fierce. Therefore, countries have no choice but to use tariff protection policies to make foreign goods unable to compete with their own domestic goods in order to protect their own industries. According to the World News Agency, India,</p>
<p>Italy, Greece, Mexico, Egypt, and Australia have all increased tariffs on foreign goods in order to protect their own goods. This is truly a measure of last resort.</p>
<p>Looking at the above-mentioned countries that have increased taxes, we can see the urgency of protecting domestic goods. Countries with less developed industries and commerce see this as even more urgent than countries with developed industries and commerce. This is because countries with less developed industries and commerce have fewer goods that are not as good and refined as those of countries with developed industries and commerce. Their technology is also inferior, and their costs are higher. They often cannot compete with foreign goods, so they are the first to feel the effects. This is the first reason. Countries with developed industries and commerce not only have foreign goods, but also have goods within their own country that are equal to them. They will definitely not be unable to compete. Even if one or two goods are not as good as those of other countries, they also have goods that are better than those of other countries, which they sell in the markets of other countries. There is still profit to be made from imports and exports. If a country's industries and commerce are not very developed, it will only be invaded by foreign goods and will have no domestic goods to export. Therefore, other than tariff protection, there is really no other method. This is the second reason. Because of these two reasons, tariff protection of domestic industries is especially important for countries with less developed industries. Furthermore, ever since England advocated the sale of English goods in its colonies, all tariff increases in English colonies have been for the sake of English goods. In the future, each country will regard its colonies exclusively as sales markets. In the end, what was once called free trade will inevitably reach a point where there is no trade to be had.</p>

<p>To Discuss Electric Power Rights Issues</p>
<p>(Harbin) This afternoon, the joint meeting of the Board of Directors of the East China Railway discussed electric power rights. Mo Dehui submitted the committee's opinions: 1. Return of the East China Railway assets; 2. Electric power rights meeting to be convened within one month; 3. Agreement on methods of payment for connecting lines; 4. Settlement of electricity fees; 5. Inspection of outbound telegrams. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) As a result of the joint meeting of the Board of Directors of the East China Railway on the 18th, the transfer of electric power rights will take place on the 21st. The Russian directors and supervisors refused to discuss the issues related to sovereignty in the Committee's opinions. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the fees obtained by our country for sovereignty over the sending and receiving of telegrams along the line of the Middle East Railway and for commercial telegrams between China and Russia are extremely small. Although the old Ministry of Communications revised the contract with the railway in the 11th year of the Republic, it was only able to increase the fee to seven cents per word. The annual loss of reporting fees is very large. Moreover, the railway uses telecommunications to spread Communism and to spy on information. Now that the government has dispatched a special representative to negotiate all matters between China and Russia, all issues related to the electric power rights of the East China Railway should be negotiated at the same time. In addition to the ministry telegraphed the Communications Committee of the East China Railway to handle matters with the ministry, a plan for the negotiation of electric power rights on the East China Railway was also drafted. The content is as follows: (1) Our country may dispatch personnel at any time to inspect the telegrams sent and received at each station of the East China Railway in order to prevent the spread of Communism. (2) The prices for sending and receiving telegrams at each station of the railway bureau should be the same as the prices charged by our country's telegraph bureau. (3) Our country should obtain half of the reporting fees for each word to show fairness. The government has been asked to order Mo Dehui to negotiate on the basis of reason.

<p>The London Conference Remains Chaotic</p>
<p>Changes in British and American Holdings Lead to Increasingly Complex Relations Between Nations</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, London, 17th - As Anglo-French negotiations stall, Britain, in an effort to break the deadlock, plans to acknowledge France's demands while increasing its navy to a considerable extent. The proposed expansion includes an increase of 50,000 tons of destroyers, totaling 200,000 tons, and an increase of 35,000 tons of cruisers, totaling 374,000 tons. Following the outcome of the Czechoslovakian conference, the situation has eased somewhat, leading to some changes. In any case, depending on future trends, Britain's holdings will inevitably undergo some changes. Consequently, the holdings of the United States will also naturally change. The overall issue seems to be becoming increasingly complex. Furthermore, as the Japanese government's return instructions have not arrived, US-Japan negotiations cannot resume. Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki convened Plenipotentiaries Matsudaira and Nagai on the 17th to discuss improvements to the US proposal. As British and American holdings have changed, Japan will naturally be affected. Relations between nations are becoming increasingly complex.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - Work at the London Naval Conference this week will be limited to informal talks between the chief delegates. There is no immediate prospect of a plenary session being convened. The main outstanding issue at present is how to distribute the tonnage of the five powers according to the categories agreed upon by the First Committee. The Naval Conference still hopes to conclude a Five-Power Treaty. There is progress in this direction between Britain and the United States, and between Britain and Japan. Although these three countries have not yet reached an agreement, the path ahead is clear of obstacles. What concerns the delegates most is the overall situation in Europe, as exemplified by the dispute between France and Italy. Unless this issue is resolved, other matters are difficult to proceed with. France now realizes that there is no hope of reducing a certain tonnage in exchange for political guarantees, while Italy remains unchanged in its demand for equality with the largest naval power in Europe, making the situation even more difficult. The talks between the British and French delegates at the end of last week did not involve political issues, indicating that France has acknowledged its position. The continuation of the conference will naturally be based on tonnage. However, this discussion is unlikely to be completed in a short period of time. Although there may not be much progress this week, the conference is unlikely to break down before French Prime Minister Tardieu</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>returns to London. There will be many private talks between the various parties in the coming days. Before returning to France today, Tardieu first met with the British Prime Minister and then with the US Secretary of State. Shortly thereafter, the British and American Prime Ministers had another talk. In the afternoon, the British Prime Minister received the Italian Foreign Minister Grandi. The British Prime Minister will have dinner with the French representatives at the French Embassy tonight. There are rumors that a proposal has been made to move political issues to Geneva. It is now known that no one has formally proposed this.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 18th - There is no official comment on whether Japan will accept the latest terms regarding auxiliary vessels between Japan and the United States. However, there are many rumors, mostly saying that the navy and diplomatic circles have very different opinions on the matter. Semi-official news from the navy is very disapproving of the proposed tonnage for 8-inch gun cruisers and submarines, and there is talk that the navy will never accept such a proposal. However, inquiries in official circles deny this news, saying that it is only the personal view of some military personnel.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 18th - The Navy has decided to send back instructions in response to Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki's request for instructions, mainly stating that there can be absolutely no concessions on large cruisers and submarines. They must adhere to their original demands even if negotiations break down. The reply was finalized last night. After deliberation at a naval summit meeting this morning, Minister of the Navy Kato handed it to Prime Minister Hamaguchi and Foreign Minister Shidehara, asking the diplomatic authorities to review it. After the Foreign Minister reports to the cabinet, it will be issued immediately. The Navy will report the process to the military councilors and then send a detailed reply to Commissioner Sakonji.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, London, 17th - According to an inspection in London, Japan will be willing to stop at its current strength on large cruisers in US-Japan negotiations, while retaining the right to build four new 10,000-ton ships to replace the Furataka class when the time for replacement arrives. For submarines, it will recognize a 60,000-ton naval holiday. On the other hand, it will increase its holdings of light cruisers and destroyers as compensation for concessions on submarines and 8-inch cruisers.</p>
<h3 id="e63">British First Lord of the Admiralty Explains New Naval Budget in the House of Commons <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - When First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander presented the naval budget in the House of Commons today, he briefly stated that this year's budget is £51,739,000, a decrease of £4,126,000 compared to 1929. The efforts of the Admiralty to economize are evident. No other country has automatically reduced military spending in this way. The British government is pleased that the general state of the world provides reasons for further delaying naval construction. This British expenditure must depend on future needs and cannot be determined until the results of the Five-Power Naval Conference are announced. It is inconvenient to discuss the naval conference today. Hopefully, the pessimism regarding the naval conference is not accurate. The reduction in this year's naval budget is largely due to the reduction in the 1928-29 shipbuilding program; otherwise, the budget would have increased by £1 million. The government has decided not to prepare shipbuilding proposals without knowing the results of the naval conference. The number of naval personnel will decrease to 97,050 in 1930 and to 94,000 in 1931. Last year, there were 99,800 people. Speaking of the Singapore naval base, the First Lord of the Admiralty said that the rapid progress of the naval base project should not hinder future decisions. Otherwise, the cost for 1930, excluding donations from autonomous territories and dependencies, will be three times the cost for 1929. Once the naval conference is over, it should be discussed with the overseas autonomous governments to determine the final decision for the naval base in the future.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - Today, the House of Commons voted on several articles regarding the number of naval personnel and other items in the naval budget. During the debate, speakers, aside from determining that the naval conference would inevitably fail, did not raise any questions about the difficulties encountered by the naval conference. Churchill, representing the Conservative Party, stated that he reserved the right to study the naval conference event in the future. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the government's naval policy was thoroughly discussed with experts.</p>

<p>Various Countries Increase Tariffs to Protect Industry, Accompanied by Industrial Rationalization</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - British Foreign Secretary Henderson said in the House of Commons today that the government had received a letter from the Japanese government stating the unequal impact on Japanese cotton goods due to India's tax increase. This matter must first be discussed with the Indian government before a response can be made. The World Society said that countries have successively implemented industrial rationalization in recent years and have simultaneously increased tariffs to protect their domestic industries. According to investigations, those who have revised tariffs since January, in addition to China's tariff reform using the gold standard system, which was implemented on February 1, include India's increase in cotton cloth tariffs (an increase of 11% to 44%, after parliamentary approval, a surcharge of 5% will be levied except on the UK), etc., listed as follows:</p>
<p>China Announced on December 1 of last year that a tung oil pool tax of one yuan per ton will be levied in Hankou.</p>
<p>India Revised the tariff schedule from January 1, regarding silk fabrics, a part has been increased.</p>
<p>Italy Since the end of last year, for imported wool, the tax of 5 lira per kilogram has been increased to 10 lira. Greece implemented a new tariff, including high tariffs, such as levying a tax on ceramics of about 100% of the price.</p>
<p>Mexico Implemented a new tariff from January 1, for silk, artificial rubber, rubber products, brushes, etc., increasing tariffs by 5% to 12%.</p>
<p>Egypt Currently plans to implement a new tariff, according to its tax rate, silk and cotton fabrics, elastic cloth, and pottery, at 20% ad valorem; toys, enamel, ironware, rubber products, glassware, brushes, and metal products at 15%.</p>
<p>Australia Since last year, increased ceramics from 50% to 60% ad valorem, an increase of 10%. It is also planned to increase tariffs on raw silk and silk fabrics. Also, Canada and others are urgently seeking to increase various tariffs, but have not yet been realized.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Japan's Unemployment Relief and Tax Reduction <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 18th - Vice Ministers of various provincial governments met at the Prime Minister's official residence yesterday to discuss the unemployment countermeasures proposed by Vice Minister of Commerce and Industry Yokoyama. As a result, the meeting unanimously decided on several relief methods, and advised the Prime Minister: (1) The unstarted sections of the Tokyo subway scheduled line should be started as soon as possible. If the government or public bodies have the rights but cannot start construction, they should be sold to private companies to promote their construction as soon as possible. (2) Reclamation projects should be permitted as long as they do not harm the public interest, so that civil engineering construction can be started. (3) The price of electricity, which is the basic power source for various industries, must be reduced to promote the rise and development of various industries, and investigations should be started immediately. In addition to the unemployment countermeasures and industrial rationalization strategies currently planned by the government, the above countermeasures should also be considered. The number of unemployed people in Japan is approximately 700,000 to 800,000 nationwide, with the 300,000 in the six major cities being the most numerous. In addition, due to the depression in all industries in recent years, the number has been increasing. According to a survey by the Ministry of Home Affairs, there are 4,873,000 workers nationwide, an increase of 48,000 from the same period last year, but the number of factory and mining workers has decreased, while transportation, communications, and communications agencies have increased slightly. Among them, the number of semi-unemployed people who are no different from free laborers is very large, and they cannot be regarded as truly employed, so they are often in a state of unemployment risk.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 11th - At a time when voices for tax reduction are rampant, as the end of the fiscal year approaches, the tendency of those who are in arrears in various places has increased. In view of this trend, the authorities have decided to implement a considerable tax reduction. The government has decided to establish a new tax system investigation committee for the purpose of tax reduction, with Minister of Finance Inoue as chairman, and appoint members of both the upper and lower houses of parliament and knowledgeable and experienced people from the private sector as members. The scope of review by the investigation committee involves the entire range of direct and indirect national taxes. In addition to the abolition of the textile consumption tax and the sugar consumption tax, each tax will be given social policy considerations, correcting it to a progressive rate that is heavier on the top and lighter on the bottom, and it is planned to raise the tax-free threshold for business income tax.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Government's Financial Relief Measures <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Executive Yuan Orders the Ministry of Finance to Comply</p>
<p>In addition to prohibiting the import of foreign silver, the measures also decided to mint 50-cent silver coins, to be handled by the Ministry of Finance. After receiving the order from the Executive Yuan, it specially instructed the Ministry of Finance yesterday to comply. The original order is as follows: "Received National Government Order No. 123, opening: Approved Central Political Conference, sealed, opening, immediately: Approved Executive Yuan, sealed, stating that the National Government Civilian Office sealed and sent a telegram from Minister of Industry and Commerce Kong Xiangxi to the Chairman, requesting that the Ministry of Finance be ordered to order the customs to prohibit the import of foreign silver coins, and that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs be ordered to instruct the Chinese representative to the League of Nations to propose to the International Exchange Conference to request the British and French governments to order the Indian and Annamese governments to stop selling existing silver for a certain period, etc. Furthermore, according to the proposal submitted to the Yuan by Minister of Industry and Commerce Kong Xiangxi based on the previous situation, including prohibiting the export of cash, replenishing bank issuance reserves, taxing imported raw silver as appropriate, and minting 50-cent bank notes, etc., the proposal was submitted to the fifth meeting of the Yuan for resolution, and then sent to the political conference for decision, etc. Approval was granted, and another opinion letter on relieving gold's high price and silver's low price was submitted by Committee Member Kong, which was divided into prohibiting the export of cash, replenishing bank issuance reserves, taxing imported raw silver as appropriate, and minting 50-cent bank notes. After being submitted to the Foreign Affairs, Economic, and Finance Groups for review, according to the review opinion report, China's unstable financial situation due to gold's high price and silver's low price has affected the international community, especially the UK and France. It seems that China should discuss relief measures with representatives from the UK and France, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should consider the situation and discuss ways to proceed. As for prohibiting the import of foreign silver coins and minting 50-cent silver coins, the Ministry of Finance should handle it as appropriate, and the rest will be discussed when the currency system is unified, etc. The 218th meeting of the conference resolved to pass the review report. The corresponding record and a copy of the original telegram, the original proposal opinion letter, and the review report were sealed and reached, hoping that you will check and instruct compliance. Attached, Minister Kong's telegram, a proposal, an opinion letter, and a review report. Based on this, the 65th National Affairs Conference of the government resolved to comply with the plan on record. In addition to the sealed reply, all attachments are copied and issued, ordering the Ministry to comply." The above order includes copying and issuing the original attached telegram proposal opinion letter and review report, ordering the Ministry to comply."</p>
<h3 id="e74">Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Concerned About Overseas Chinese <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese abroad have long suffered from oppressive regulations. Since the establishment of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission by the central government, it has repeatedly spoken out on behalf of overseas Chinese who have been treated unfairly, and has sent letters to the National Government requesting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs find ways to abolish the oppressive regulations. Recently, it was discovered that new oppressive regulations have been promulgated in Tahiti, French Polynesia. Overseas Chinese Affairs Commissioner Chen Anren, recognizing this, made a special proposal, requesting the National Government to instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to promptly negotiate for the abolition of these regulations. This proposal has been passed by the 75th meeting. The proposal is recorded as follows: "Tahiti is located far in the South Pacific, under French rule for many years. I, during my travels there seven years ago, saw that the resident government allowed people from all countries, whether scholars, farmers, workers, or merchants, to enter and operate freely. Approximately 5,000 of our overseas Chinese live in Tahiti, living and working in peace and contentment. In recent years, the businesses of overseas Chinese have been developing rapidly, and more people from China are arriving due to difficult living conditions. The resident government became jealous and changed its previous laissez-faire attitude, enacting interventionist regulations. Except for people from other countries, all overseas Chinese entering Tahiti must pay a deposit of 900 silver dollars as a guarantee, and must not commit any crime warranting repatriation within five years in order to have it returned. Overseas Chinese entering Tahiti are treated like suspected criminals awaiting trial. This not only fosters a psychology of contempt for overseas Chinese, but also insults the dignity of the nation. This is extremely unfair. If they do not pay the deposit and obtain an entry permit in advance, shipping companies in Hong Kong will not sell them tickets, and they will not be allowed to disembark upon arrival. There is no consulate there, no channel for appeal, and no way to seek redress. This commercial port, where they have freely resided and operated for years, unexpectedly adopts the policies of white Australia and the regulations of French America at a time when our country is striving to abolish unequal treaties, which is deeply regrettable. Therefore, I propose that this be forwarded to the National Government, instructing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to promptly negotiate for the abolition of the new regulations, and to dispatch a consul as soon as possible to protect the interests of the resident overseas Chinese and the freedom of entry. I sincerely hope this is appropriate. Respectfully awaiting your decision. Proposer: Chen Anren."</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Yellow River's Spring Flood Rises Sharply <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The Zhengong Committee at Liuyuan Kou, North of Kaifeng, Has Instructed Dike Reinforcement</p>
<p>Kaifeng dispatch: The Yellow River's water level has risen. The river’s flow is divided into spring, summer, and autumn floods. The spring flood is also called the peach flood, resulting from the melting of snow upstream on the Yellow River. Now, as the peach flood season approaches, the river's water level has risen sharply, causing the flood to shift south. On the night of the 9th of this month, the river eroded Liuyuan Kou, 18 miles north of Kaifeng. The eight fortresses of Xinanxun immediately reported this to the Yellow River Zhengong Committee. Upon receiving the report, the committee dispatched Chief Zhang of the Engineering Department, along with key personnel, to investigate on the morning of the 10th. They observed the rapid currents, the surging roars, and the proximity to the originally established suction machine house, recognizing the potential danger. Consequently, they instructed the officers and soldiers of the dike garrison to transport stones and reinforce the dikes with all possible efforts. However, given the vastness of the water, the authorities deeply feared an unexpected incident. Committee Director He Qishen personally arrived at the work site to oversee the repairs, ordering the deployment of over 3,000 burlap sacks and more than five cubic meters of crushed stone. Currently, due to the direct impact of the strong current, the existing sandbars and stone dams are gradually collapsing. Civil Affairs Director Li, Construction Director Zhang, and Education Director Zhang, among others, successively visited the work site for inspection. The engineering personnel found that simply throwing burlap sacks was ineffective and unsustainable, so they planned to revert to the old method of using box-shaped brushwood structures. Reportedly, the first section of brushwood construction has begun, and they are actively procuring materials and working around the clock. The location is north of Kaifeng, where the riverbed is several times higher than the city of Kaifeng, so the potential for damage is imaginable. (13th)</p>

<h3 id="e77">Xiamen Customs Seizes Japanese Ship Smuggling Copper Coins <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>And Catches a Ship of Undeclared Piece Goods; Both Ships Have Been Detained</p>
<p>Xiamen dispatch: On the 8th and 9th of this month, Xiamen Customs seized two small Japanese steamships near the port, carrying smuggled piece goods and Chinese copper coins, worth over ten thousand yuan. The crew members were detained and sent to the Japanese consulate, while the ships and cargo were detained. Previously, Customs received a tip that a Japanese steamship was carrying a large quantity of undeclared piece goods to Quanzhou, and instructed the port lighthouse to be vigilant. On the 8th, the lighthouse reported that the Japanese ship Baoyun Maru had arrived in Xiamen from Hong Kong, intending to proceed to Quanzhou. Customs immediately dispatched a speedboat to investigate. The Baoyun Maru indeed entered the port and sailed to the waters of Dadan. The speedboat, fearing it was unable to capture the ship, turned to urging its escape, and returned to report to Customs. Customs dispatched an armed cruiser to intercept. The Japanese ship was turning to enter Quanzhou, the cruiser sounded its horn to warn it to stop. The Japanese ship ignored the warning and opened the throttle to escape rapidly out of the port. The cruiser again signaled with flags to warn it, but the Japanese ship continued to escape rapidly. The cruiser also opened its throttle and pursued. Before long, it caught up. The Japanese ship still did not stop, so the cruiser's sailors fired warning shots and prepared to fire live rounds. The cruiser also had small cannons. The Japanese ship, realizing it was outmatched, finally stopped. The cruiser's sailors and customs officers boarded the ship and inspected it, discovering over 500 pieces of undeclared piece goods, and many other goods, worth about 20,000 yuan. The ship was escorted into port, the smuggled goods confiscated, unloaded into the customs warehouse, and the ship's engine was dismantled. It was detained behind Gulangyu and guarded. Three key crew members were detained and sent to the Japanese consulate. On the 9th, Customs received a report that another Japanese ship was smuggling, and dispatched a cruiser to intercept. It intercepted the Japanese ship Rong Maru, slightly smaller than the Baolian Maru, carrying hundreds of bags of Chinese copper coins, worth over 80,000 yuan. According to investigations, it had sailed from Wenzhou to Xiamen. The import of large quantities of copper coins is strictly prohibited by Customs. Even if crew members of ordinary merchant ships privately carry several thousand copper coins, they are confiscated, because they can disrupt the market and the economy. Customs used five barges to unload the copper coins and transport them to the Customs Commissioner's office in Gulangyu. The ship's engine was also dismantled and guarded after it was detained at Pengyu. One key crew member was sent to the Japanese consulate for detention. The Japanese consulate stated that it had not yet interrogated the individual and could not announce the details. Customs will auction off the 253 pieces of undeclared printed calico, seven pieces of dark striped cloth, eight pieces of jacquard silk, and 200 pieces of colored floral silk and satin smuggled by the Baolian Maru today. The cruiser's crew and sailors will also be generously rewarded. The value of copper coins is higher in Xiamen, with only 240 coins exchanged for one silver dollar, compared to the exchange rate of around 300 in Shanghai. Each dollar can earn a profit of 50 or 60 coins, so 80,000 yuan in copper coins can earn a profit of over 15,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Japanese ships frequently smuggle undeclared goods in Dongshan County. As a result, merchants from Dongshan, Yunxiao, Zhao'an, and Zhangpu counties flock to Dongshan to trade. Xiamen and Shantou Customs are losing 500,000 to 600,000 yuan in tax revenue each year as a result. On the 6th of this month, the Shantou Customs Commissioner, acting on a report, personally boarded the Minsheng warship of the Fourth Fleet and pursued the Japanese steamships Haidong and Daping to Dongshan. The ships' engines have now been removed and sealed. (March 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Hebei Provincial Government Decides on New Route for Hai River Diversion <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The Hebei Provincial Government recently received a letter from the Hai River Renovation Committee regarding the determination of the new diversion route and requesting verification of land purchase and tomb relocation matters, as well as notification to Tianjin County for joint handling. The Provincial Government, upon receiving the letter, specifically presented it for discussion at the Provincial Government Committee meeting on the 11th. It was decided that "Route D is too close, has too many graves, and the land price is too high, causing many inconveniences. It is proposed to adopt Route C as the starting point and Route B as the ending point, as the line is more suitable." A reply will be sent to the Hai River Committee within days for their information. The letter from the Hai River Committee to the Provincial Government is recorded as follows: "According to a report from the Engineering Committee of this committee," stating, "This committee's engineering work, previously formulated by this committee with the engineering progress schedule, and submitted to the General Assembly for approval on record, according to the prescribed procedures, all new diversion route terrain, and lock inlet sluices, and control sluices near the terrain measurement work, should be completed by the end of February. Having consulted the chief and deputy engineers of the Engineering Department, and jointly supervised the measurement teams, they worked separately and actively, completing all measurements by the 25th of this month (February). The chief and deputy engineers of the Engineering Department, along with the measurement reports, submitted a request to convene a meeting to discuss and determine the new diversion route. On the 28th of this month, this committee convened the sixteenth meeting, discussing publicly. The consensus was that the new diversion route measured this time was divided into four lines, A, B, C, and D. Lines A and C could not be used due to directional relationships. Lines B and D each had their advantages and disadvantages in comparison, but Line D was more suitable. Line B starts north of Qujiadian and ends near Beicang Railway Station. The project requires approximately 370,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Within 300 meters of the route, there are approximately 500 graves. Line D starts north of Beicang Village and ends south of Beicang Railway Station. The project requires approximately 300,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Along the route, there are approximately 1,500 graves. Comparing the two, Line B requires more earthwork, while Line D has significantly more graves. Economically speaking, there is little difference. Both lines are usable. However, the mouth of the Yongding River into the North Canal is downstream of the starting point of Line B. If Line B is used, the river mouth must be diverted upstream for the flow to be smooth. The current riverbed into the canal is very natural in terms of terrain. If the direction is changed, it is uncertain whether unexpected events will occur. Therefore, from a technical point of view, it is better to use Line D, which is more appropriate. The entire group decided unanimously in favor. If approved, the General Affairs Department should promptly handle all necessary matters such as land purchase and tomb relocation, to implement the work according to the procedure to avoid delays. Whether this is appropriate, detailed drawings are attached for your review and implementation." The matter was submitted to the 18th meeting of this committee for public discussion. The consensus was that, regarding the survey of the new diversion route, it was proposed to adopt Line D, and the General Affairs Department and Engineering Department should be assigned to jointly mark the route with Tianjin County, explain the reasons for adopting Line D, and announce the land price. At the same time, a letter should be sent to your government for verification, and Tianjin County should be notified to handle it jointly. In addition to instructing the General Affairs Department and Engineering Department of this committee to comply and notifying Tianjin for joint handling, accordingly, three copies of the survey map and the investigation report form of the General Affairs Department are enclosed, requesting your government to verify and handle it and reply as soon as possible."</p>
<h3 id="e79">Wu Xingya Discusses Hubei Pacification Problems <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The Central Government Has Approved the Organization of Ten Provincial Defense Regiments; Counties Suffering Rampant Banditry Will Decide to Launch Suppression Campaigns Ahead of Schedule</p>
<p>Hankou dispatch: Banditry and communist insurgency in Hubei are rampant. In recent months, they have been worse than before. Counties such as Jianli and Mianyang in central Hubei, Huang'an and Macheng in eastern Hubei, Yangxin and Daye in southern Hubei, and Suixian and Zhaoyang in northern Hubei have all fallen into the hands of bandits. Although the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters and the former Hubei Garrison Command have dispatched troops to suppress them, their movements are unpredictable, making it difficult to eliminate them in one fell swoop. They grow covertly and cannot be brought under control. After the new Civil Affairs Director Wu Xingya arrived in Hubei, the Garrison Headquarters entrusted the pacification matters to the Civil Affairs Department for overall management. I visited Wu yesterday to inquire about the future pacification policy. Wu's statement is as follows: (Question) Pacification in this province has been unable to proceed actively due to the impact of the current situation. I heard that the authorities are now urgently seeking relief. What are the relief methods? (Wu's answer) At this time, the suppression of bandits throughout the province is the responsibility of the national army stationed in Hubei. However, when the national army has other tasks, it must be transferred, so bandits cannot be completely suppressed and troops cannot but abandon the effort and go elsewhere. Chairman He's recent visit to Nanjing to meet with Chairman Jiang is to request that the national army stationed in Hubei be confirmed and not be transferred until the bandits are suppressed, so as to achieve complete success. It is necessary to suppress bandit disturbances in all counties. However, there is a procedure for suppression. Large numbers of troops should be dispatched to encircle and suppress areas where bandits are concentrated or relatively rampant. The remaining scattered bandits will be easily suppressed. It has now been decided to divide counties such as Jian, Mian, Huang, Ma, Yang, and Ye, which are the most severely affected by bandits, into three bandit suppression areas. After Chairman He returns to Hankou, the troops designated by the Central Government to be responsible for the pacification of Hubei Province will be transferred to the bandit areas and suppressed simultaneously to prevent them from fleeing and causing further disturbances. (Question) Localities have no choice but to request the national army to encircle and suppress bandits due to rampant banditry. This is a temporary measure. For the sake of permanent local security, what should the provincial government do? (Answer) Regarding this point, we have examined the actual needs of the localities and referred to successful cases in provinces such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The provincial government will organize ten provincial defense regiments, adopting a three-three system: one regiment with three battalions, and one battalion with three companies. The soldiers will be recruited entirely from the civilian population. Weapons will be allocated by the Central Government, and salaries will be paid from the provincial treasury. They will be completely under the command and dispatch of the provincial government and the Civil Affairs Department, responsible for local bandit suppression and all security matters in the future. I have just received a telegram from Chairman Jiang approving this plan. Four regiments will be established within three months, and the remaining six regiments will be established in stages. (Question) Now that the provincial defense army is being organized, will the county militias be reorganized at the same time? (Answer) We are currently working on reorganizing the militias. Training, deployment, and funding will all be standardized. Each county will be responsible for handling the matter, preventing local bullies from manipulating and controlling them. If the militia weapons are damaged or insufficient, they will be allowed to prepare funds to repair them in the province, or to purchase additional weapons as appropriate. Once they are reorganized, several counties will be designated as a county defense zone. A capable county magistrate will be selected, or the Civil Affairs Department will send special commissioners to be responsible for commanding the militias and inspecting drills within the joint defense zone. In this way, if there is a bandit alarm in any locality, the militia will be able to use all their strength to suppress it. (March 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Yifeng, Jiangxi Province, Again Captured by Bandits <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Report of Recovery in Lianhua County</p>
<p>Nanchang dispatch, 15th: Banditry and the Red peril are the most serious problems currently facing Jiangxi, and are deeply lamented by the entire province. Anfu County was captured by the Peng bandits on the 10th of this month, and before the blood has dried, Yifeng County has also been lost. Yifeng borders Tonggu and Wanzai, and was previously devastated by Huang Gonglue and the black-hearted bandits. On the 12th of this month, a large group of Red bandits, numbering about 2,000 to 3,000 with over a thousand guns, suddenly arrived and captured Tianbao Liucun under the jurisdiction of the county. At 9:00 a.m. on the 13th, they also captured the county seat, broke open the prison, burned the county government, looted wantonly, and burned civilian houses. Yesterday, the county's fellow villagers in the province received a telegram from the county stating that the communists had captured the city on the first day of the month, looted the civilian population, and burned down the entire county. The whereabouts of the county magistrate and the chief of public security are unknown. Also, the county chamber of commerce sent a telegram to the province yesterday requesting assistance, which stated, "Urgent, Nanchang Provincial Government Chairman Lu Jun, the Red bandits are rampant, Tianbao Township, under the jurisdiction of the county, was captured on Wen day, and the county seat was recaptured on the first day of the month. The government was destroyed, the prison was broken open, and the entire county is in ruins. Please immediately dispatch troops nearby to relieve the suffering. Yifeng County Chamber of Commerce, Kouchang Yuan Yin." After receiving the telegram, Lu Diping immediately ordered Commander Zhang to urgently transfer the special service battalion from Fenyi and the garrison troops from Wanzai to suppress the bandits. As for Lianhua County in western Jiangxi, which had previously been captured by bandits, the Civil Affairs Department received a telegram today (the 15th) from County Magistrate Chen Dexing from You County, Hunan Province, stating that the county seat had been recovered on the 11th, the bandits had fled, and he was currently working with local gentry to handle the aftermath.</p>

<p>Ships Sunk in Tongjiang Battle Being Prepared for Salvage</p>
<p>Qingdao dispatch: Northeastern Navy Commander Shen Honglie arrived in Qingdao on the 12th via Liaoning, Changshan Islands, and other places, inspecting the coastal defenses and reviewing the First Fleet. It is heard that, in order to protect fishing boats and eliminate pirates, Shen has re-allocated the naval defense of the fleet along the coast of the Bohai Sea. One battalion of marines will be stationed on Changshan Island, along with the Weihai and Tongan warships. Two companies of marines and the Haichen gunboat will be stationed in Lianshan Bay. The Jiangli, Zhenhai, Dinghai, and Zhaohe warships, as well as about one battalion of marines, will be stationed in Qingdao. One battalion of marines will be stationed in Jimo. The Chuyu and Yongxiang warships will cruise the ports of Haizhou, Qingdao, Shidao, Changshan Islands, and Yantai. The Yongxiang warship previously sailed to the waters of Haizhou to suppress pirates and has now cleared the area. Also, during last year's Sino-Soviet war, the Jiangheng, Liji, Suijiang, Anjiang, and Tai five ships were sunk. The Lisui ship has now been salvaged, repaired, and is still docked in Songhua River and other places. The Jiangheng, Liji, Jiang'anjiang, and Tai four ships are currently being prepared for salvage after the river thaws during the Qingming Festival. However, the Jiang'anjiang and Tai two ships, which were converted from merchant ships into gunboats, were severely damaged. It is unknown whether they can be used after they are salvaged. As for the Hengjiang and Liji two ships, the damage was minor, and they can be used after slight repairs. (15th)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Siamese Rice to Be Exclusively Sold by Government <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Major Impact on Food Supply in Shantou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou</p>
<p>Shantou News: The people of southern China rely on rice as their staple food, but rice production is quite low, so most of the rice each year depends on imports from other ports. According to a survey by the Social Affairs Section of the Shantou Municipal Government in the 18th year of the Republic, the amount of rice imported from other ports in one year is as follows:</p>
<p>Rice from Singapore: 5,824 dan</p>
<p>Rice from Annam (Saigon): 17,834 dan</p>
<p>Siamese rice via Hong Kong: 253,726 dan</p>
<p>Siamese rice: 783,760 dan</p>
<p>Wuhu rice: 806,302 dan</p>
<p>Rangoon rice: 291,436 dan</p>
<p>In total, about one million dan or more of Siamese rice are sold to Shantou each year. At the current market price, each dan (100 catties) costs 9.6 silver dollars, so the value is about ten million yuan.</p>
<p>Siam is located in Nanyang and has close ties with our country. Since the Qing Dynasty, the government authorities have often overlooked Siam because it is a small country. Last year, there were many calls to sign a commercial treaty with Siam, which attracted great attention from the people of Chaoshan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent personnel to investigate the number of overseas Chinese in Siam so that consulates could be established after the Sino-Siamese commercial treaty was concluded. According to the report from the investigating committee returning to Beijing last winter, the population of Siam is approximately 9,520,000, including 3,800,000 Sino-Siamese mixed-race people, 3,650,000 Lao people, 500,000 pure Chinese people, 450,000 Khmer people, 400,000 Malay people, 120,000 Mongol and Karen people, and 60,000 Saba aborigines. The above population numbers are based on the Siamese government's survey. The Siamese government is silent about the power of the overseas Chinese, so it only mentions that there are 500,000 adult male overseas Chinese in Bangkok, Siam (those who have paid their personal tax). Most of the locally born children and family members are not included. According to the statistics of Siamese researcher Mr. Parnai Cheng (a Siamese priest), there are 1.5 million overseas Chinese in Siam. According to the German Milner's Universal Gazetteer, there are 2.5 to 3 million overseas Chinese in Siam. I traveled to Bangkok ten years ago and saw that the city was full of Chinese people, and the Chaozhou dialect had become the common language in Siamese cities. Chaozhou people occupy an important position in the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors of Siam. Shantou has a Siamese Chamber of Commerce, which is the central hub for overseas Chinese trade. Siam's exports are dominated by timber and white rice. Timber for shipbuilding around the world has long been nationalized for official sale. White rice is exported to southern China and Japan. Large-scale rice mills are all in the hands of our Chinese people. This spring, Chaoshan rice merchants received letters from Siamese joint ventures stating that the Siamese government has decided to nationalize the export of rice, and Chinese rice mills will be forced to close down. This matter has a great impact on the food supply of southern China, and our countrymen should pay close attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e83">New Rural Village Projects in Jiangsu Agricultural Department <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Huangxu Has Roughly Taken Shape; Provincial Government Approves Allocation of 1,000 Yuan in Subsidies</p>
<p>In order to improve rural areas throughout the province, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines has designated five locations for model new rural villages: the Salt Reclamation Area, Chunhua Town, Changgou Village, Shijia墩, and Xinfeng District (now renamed Huangxu District). These five locations were to be subsidized as part of the 18th-year budget, but because of financial constraints in the provincial treasury, the Salt Reclamation Area, Chunhua Town, and Changgou Village were not started, and subsidies for the Shijia墩 new rural village were temporarily suspended. However, since Huangxu is near the provincial capital, in order to demonstrate success, the Zhenjiang County Huangxu Rural Improvement Experimental Zone Committee was organized in October of last year and has been responsible for handling the project. Progress has been uninterrupted so far. Major works in the district, such as the construction of the Xin-Huang highway, surveying the water level, renovating the assembly hall, expanding the people's night school, setting up a public reading room and a public sports field, compiling household registration for villagers, improving local sanitation, and reclaiming wasteland for planting mulberry trees and afforestation, have roughly taken shape. However, the original budget for the district was only 2,000 yuan, which has already been fully received. Currently, various projects urgently require funds. The budget for this year still requires 1,000 silver dollars. In order to maintain the district's project, the Department of Agriculture and Mines specifically proposed to the provincial government that 1,000 yuan be misappropriated from other new rural village subsidies. An order was issued to the Finance Department to release the funds early to facilitate progress, which has been approved by the Provincial Government Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Disturbance in Linhai County, Zhejiang Province, Has Been Resolved <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government previously received a telegram from Linhai County Magistrate Hou Changling reporting that bandit Wang Xiaojian and others in Guankeng Village in the southern part of the county were opposing land surveying and reporting, and after shooting and killing a team leader and two soldiers of the Naraixi Village Defense Corps, gathered more than 300 bandits and occupied Guankeng Village and Shanggan Shamen and other places. The county magistrate led a team to suppress the bandits twice, but failed to eliminate them due to the treacherous terrain, and requested that the provincial army be sent to suppress them. After receiving the telegram, the provincial government, in addition to ordering the county magistrate to take proper precautions, specifically telegraphed Zhu Mingtao, commander of the 5th Regiment of the Haimen Security Corps, to quickly lead a team to Linhai to suppress the bandits and investigate and handle the lead offenders. Commander Zhu has now led a battalion of infantry and a machine gun company from Haimen to Linhai to suppress the bandits.

<p>Government Rice for Equalization of Prices Looted En Route; Seven People Died in Hangzhou in One Day</p>
<p>Due to excessive disasters in various counties of Zhejiang Province and a lack of food for the people, the local situation is intermittently unstable. The provincial government approved the Civil Affairs Department's plan to borrow funds to purchase rice to implement equalization of prices, and members were dispatched by the Chamber of Commerce to purchase rice from Hunan, Anhui, and other provinces. However, after three or four months, the rice has still not been transported. The food supply for the severely affected counties relies entirely on the rice provided by the Jisheng Association and the Relief Affairs Association. Fortunately, 3,000 piculs of government rice purchased by the province in Jiangsu has already been shipped, but a rice looting incident occurred en route. Previously, the provincial government ordered the special service company of the 2nd Regiment of the Changxing Security Corps to send troops to protect the government rice. When the rice passed through Lushan, about 500 poor people gathered to riot. Lin Xishi, the officer of the company, immediately implemented suppression, but the rice had already been forcefully looted by the poor people. Seven or eight principal offenders, including Zhou Wencai, Lin Bao Rong, and Guo Jin Song, were arrested on the spot and sent to the 2nd Regiment for interrogation. After persuasion, the rest each took rice and dispersed. The rice has now been transported past Shiqiao and will arrive in Hangzhou in a few days. However, 3,000 piculs will be distributed to various counties for equalization of prices, so each county will receive very little. It will take time to wait for funds to be transferred and re-purchased, and the food problem cannot be resolved. The local future is precarious. For example, Lu Ayou, a resident outside Wangjiangmen in Hangzhou, his wife, and their two sons, committed suicide by hanging because rice was expensive and food was difficult to find. Sun Defa, who lived in Houjie Street, Zhakou, also hanged himself with his mother due to poverty and illness. In addition, an old woman named Xiao, who lived in 200 rooms on Putisi Road in the new market, also committed suicide because rice was expensive. Statistics show that seven people died in one day due to the high price of rice. The dangerous signs of the food situation can be seen generally. (18th)</p>

<p>The Construction Department plans to summon construction personnel from all counties in the province to Hangzhou to discuss local construction projects in their respective counties, covering transportation, agriculture, mining, industry, commerce, water conservancy, as well as railways, highways, telecommunications, and other areas.</p>
<p>The Finance and Construction Departments, upon receiving a dispatch from the provincial government regarding a request from the Hangzhou silk industry for tax reduction or exemption, have had Construction Department Secretary Huo Baoshu and Finance Department Secretary-General Gu Guiyu engage in substantive discussions. It is reported that Hangzhou factories require raw silk, and each 80 catties is subject to an additional Shanghai tax of 3.2 yuan, while each case of artificial silk is subject to an additional Shanghai tax of 13 yuan. Complete exemption of both items is unlikely to achieve the desired outcome, but a reasonable reduction is hoped for.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou General Chamber of Commerce has borrowed commercial funds to procure rice at stable prices. Tang Yongfu has been dispatched to Shanghai to order 5,000 piculs of Saigon rice. This rice is expected to be shipped to Hangzhou in batches soon. It is reported that the Civil Affairs Department has decided to allocate 2,000 piculs of rice and issue a document to the Three Granaries Committee to subsidize sales at stable prices. The remaining 3,000 piculs will be distributed to rice merchants for sale at affordable prices.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Municipal and County Rice Price Assessment Committee held its 12th temporary meeting yesterday. The matters discussed were: (1) A proposal to sell grades of rice from pawnshops without additional screening and based directly on their original quality. It was decided that screening should continue as before, and the quality grades of rice from pawnshops would temporarily remain as they were, with further discussion to be postponed. (2)</p>
<p>Assessing rice prices: It was decided that, starting from the 19th, the price of top-grade rice, medium-grade rice, as well as steamed glutinous rice and late-season indica rice, would each increase by 40 cents per picul. Medium-to-lower-grade rice would increase by 20 cents. Glutinous rice prices would remain the same. To safeguard the interests of the poor, the prices of entry-level rice and rice for the common people would not be allowed to increase. (18th)</p>

<p>Minutes of the County Government Meeting: The County Government held its 49th meeting yesterday, with Chairman Jin of the County Government presiding. (1) Regarding the boats of the Shaoxing guild in this port, which charge varying prices to out-of-town passengers who hire them, it was proposed that this practice should be banned to benefit travelers. It was decided that fixed prices should be established for all types of boats. The County Magistrate should instruct the Construction Bureau to conduct a detailed investigation and draft regulations and a price list for review at a meeting. (2) Regarding the many bridge reconstructions within the First District, including those completed, unfinished, in progress, or planned, the question was raised whether the Construction Bureau should inspect and review them to ensure the quality of the projects. It was decided that the reconstruction of bridges is an important matter. Completed bridges should be reported by the First District Office to the County Government and then forwarded to the Construction Bureau for inspection. For bridges in progress or planned, the names of the bridges and their plans should be submitted to the County Government and then forwarded to the Construction Bureau for review before construction begins. (3) Regarding the proposed reconstruction of the Puzhao Temple Bridge, which connects to the main street and sees heavy pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and whether the Construction Bureau should prepare the plans before construction begins, it was decided to approve the proposal and instruct the Construction Bureau and the First District Office to implement it accordingly.</p>
<p>The Education Association Appoints Judges for the County Education Bureau: Previously, to promote the development of teaching materials for the common knowledge subject in primary schools, preparations were underway to establish an exhibition of achievements in the common knowledge subject in primary schools. Due to insufficient preparation, the event was rescheduled to be held on April 1st and 2nd at the County Middle School. As the opening date is approaching, the Bureau Affairs Meeting of the Education Bureau decided to appoint judges, including Jiang Longyuan, Shen Shoujin, Zhang Boqi, Huang Mingxiang, Du Kanghou, Yu Gongda, Zhang Shoubai, Zhu Shuren, Yu Peixin, Zhu Moxiang, Zhang Mingguang, Zou Xianting, and Zhang Zhongcai.

<p>Aftermath of the Robbery at Xuli Bridge: Following the robbery at Xuli Bridge, fortunately, reinforcements from Nanqiao arrived, and the merchants were not affected. Magistrate Hong led police to the town that night to handle the aftermath. All the deceased Police Officer Chen and merchant Gao Xiang, who was killed by a stray bullet, have been separately collected and coffined. However, the two seriously injured policemen were escorted back and claimed that the hospital refused to treat them due to excessive blood loss. After repeated negotiations, the hospital reluctantly agreed. Surgery is currently underway, and if the bullets can be removed without complications, it may be possible to save them. The cost is reportedly quite high, and the two heads of the county bureau are temporarily providing assistance. As for the pursuit of the perpetrators, the county government held an emergency meeting last night based on intelligence, and it is expected that a breakthrough will be made soon. Regarding town defense, the police station has lost all its firearms, so yesterday, two platoons of the county police force were dispatched to reinforce the defense. The original police force in various locations, which was already thin, has also been supplemented by two squads of the yet-to-be-established temporary police force, dispatched by the county on a strict schedule to increase strength.</p>
<p>Medical and Pharmaceutical Commemoration Meeting: Four groups, including the Chinese Medicine Association and the Commercial Association Pharmaceutical Society, have been preparing for the March 17th Medical and Pharmaceutical Struggle Commemoration for a long time.

<p>Lake Bandits Rampant, Recruiting Boatmen: After the Yang Santai Temple on the shores of Yangcheng Lake, where the border of Suzhou and Kunshan meets, was occupied by more than 300 lake bandits, the bandits have become increasingly rampant. Not only are they robbing in nearby villages, but the bandits even sent out members to recruit 30 boatmen, distributing rations to them. The other day (the 15th), Wang Sanxuan, a villager from Hudian Township outside the West Gate of Changshu, and his son Xingxing and cousin Wang Shinu, sailed to Suzhou to purchase seedlings and fertilizer. As they passed the area, they were stopped by the bandits, who took Wang Sanxuan away and declared that they were under the orders of Old Woman Guo to recruit boatmen. Shinu, seeing his brother taken away by the bandits, returned to Changshu to report to the county government for pursuit. The Anti-Bandit Army: The 13th Brigade of the Anti-Bandit Army General Headquarters, dispatched from Bengbu, arrived in Suzhou on the evening of the 17th and stationed at the West Garden Jietang Temple. The First Battalion of the 25th Regiment hired boats yesterday morning to proceed to Wujiang. The regimental headquarters is stationed at the Chenghuang Temple in Wujiang. Today (the 19th), they will be stationed in Pingwang North and other places. Commander Hu believes that only Hengjing and the East and West Mountains of Taihu Lake can concentrate troops. If he intends to distribute troops to various villages, the troop strength is still insufficient, so a comprehensive plan is still needed.</p>
<p>The Death Sentence for 171 Bandit Leaders and Accomplices: Taihu bandit leader Zhu Yubo was arrested in Shanghai last November and brought to Suzhou for interrogation. The local court sentenced him to death on the 17th, along with 171 accomplices. The main points of the verdict are as follows: For the crime of collectively gathering in the mountains and resisting government troops, he is sentenced to death and deprived of civil rights indefinitely. For the six counts of jointly committing robbery and intentionally killing people, he is sentenced to death and deprived of civil rights indefinitely for each count. For the 94 counts of jointly committing robbery while holding firearms, engaging in large-scale robbery, robbery on the sea, and resisting government troops, he is sentenced to death and deprived of civil rights indefinitely for each count. For the 74 counts of kidnapping for ransom, he is sentenced to death and deprived of civil rights indefinitely for each count. He shall be executed and deprived of civil rights indefinitely. Once the appeal is approved, the sentence must be carried out according to law.</p>
<p>The Verdict in the Case of the Patrol Officer Neglecting His Duty: Gu Shurong, the former patrol officer of the Wushenjing Public Security Substation, was sentenced to seven years and six months in prison by the Wuxian Local Court for using private torture that resulted in the death of a petty thief named Sun Da Kui. The court sent personnel to the countryside to conduct an examination, which confirmed the facts. Gu was brought to court for trial. Gu did not accept the verdict and appealed to the High Court. The second instance upheld the original verdict. Gu still refused to accept it and appealed to the Supreme Court, which sent the case back to the High Court for retrial. The verdict was announced yesterday, overturning the original sentence and reducing it to four years and six months of imprisonment.</p>
<p>The Case of the Robbery at the Head of the Security Corps' House Solved: Zhang Pu, the head of the Xukou Township Security Corps in the Mudu District of the county, had his house robbed by five bandits on the 13th. The bandits fled in different directions after obtaining the stolen goods. The Second District Seventh Squad of the resident Mudu Water Police arrested Tian A-Xi, the principal offender, in Mudu Town. After interrogation by Captain Li, he confessed without denial and also implicated accomplices Shi A-Gui and Wu A-Da. The squad then captured Shi A-Gui, who also confessed. Later, a suspect named Fang Guifu was apprehended and sent to the Second District of Wuxi for processing on the 17th.</p>

<p>The County Government Examines the Body of a Child: It was discovered that there was the body of a wounded boy inside the Shiqiaobang of Huai Township in the county. Liu Chunlan, the leader of the First Squad of the First Company of the resident County Police Team, investigated and found three suspects, Yang A-Da and others. Yesterday, it was learned that County Government Adjudicator Yu, accompanied by Examiner Shen, took a motorboat to the countryside to conduct a legal examination. The examination determined that the deceased boy was about eleven or twelve years old and had been severely beaten with an iron instrument and buried alive. After the examination, as no family members of the deceased came to claim the body, the local bailiff was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial and affix a seal to the altar. Mr. Yu and others then returned to the city by car. As for the suspects Yang A-Da and others, after interrogation by Squad Leader Liu yesterday, it was determined that they were not involved, and they were released on bail separately.</p>
<p>Water Police Seize Privately Transported Rice Boats: There is not much rice stored in this county, and sources from various places are scarce. However, unscrupulous merchants, disregarding the people's food supply, are transporting large quantities of rice out of the county, causing rice prices to rise daily, causing panic among ordinary people. However, the Zhou Yuchang Rice Shop outside the South Gate of Huangnifeng secretly loaded about 100 stones of white rice onto a boat to transport it to Changxing, Zhejiang Province. Yesterday, it was seized by the squadron leader of the Third Platoon of the Sixth Team of the Second District of the Waterfront Provincial Public Security Team, stationed in Wuxi, Ji Zaiyang, and Officer Li, at Daxuankou. They were immediately brought into the city and transferred to the district headquarters. District Chief Mao interrogated the boatman Wang Jinguai, who claimed that the rice was being transported to Zhejiang Province and that he had a passport from the Construction Committee of the National Government. District Chief Mao, based on the confession, telegraphed the Civil Affairs Department for instructions on how to handle the matter. Late-Night Tragedy of Two Murders by Gunfire: Yang Xianyi, a resident of No. 23 Sibao Alley outside the North Gate of this county, was known as a famous "swallow's nest" for selling opium. At around 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, five people dressed in soldiers' uniforms and speaking in a foreign accent suddenly came to Yang Xianyi's house, demanding money to smoke opium, pestering him endlessly. Yang politely refused, and the men left resentfully. Unexpectedly, at 9:45 PM, just after the Yang family finished dinner, they suddenly heard someone knocking urgently on the back door (the door used for people to enter and exit when selling opium). Xianyi thought it was an opium addict and personally opened the door. He caught a glimpse of six people dressed in uniforms resembling deserters. Two of them carried Mauser pistols, and four held handguns. The deserters entered the door and, without asking any questions, swept the room with the Mauser pistols. Yang Xianyi's eldest son, Yang Quanjin (30 years old), and opium servant Wu Rinsheng (62 years old, from Tianshangsi, Shangshi) were instantly shot and fell to the ground, dead. The six deserters immediately fled towards Shuxiang Lane. Yang Quanjin, who died tragically, was shot four times, and opium servant Wu Rinsheng was shot once, both in vital areas. After the incident, the Public Security Bureau of the county government dispatched detectives to search for the murderers, but they could not be found. At 11:00 PM that night, Yang Xianyi, accompanied by the local bailiff Wu Jiahe, went to the county government to report the incident for an examination. The county government, considering the severity of the case, immediately sent Adjudicator Yu, accompanied by Examiner Shen, to the scene to conduct an examination. The examination confirmed that Yang Quanjin and Wu Rinsheng had both died from gunshot wounds before death. The bodies were coffined by the Yang family, and a receipt was issued for the coffin. They then returned to the county government.</p>

<p>Extortion by Bandits for Enclosure Fields: Huang Zhu Xian of Dingshu Township, Sixth District, was abducted by bandits in Weicun, Wujin, the other day. His clothes were stripped off, but he was rescued by the anti-smuggling team. Zhu Xian was also searched by bandits for more than 1,000 yuan of enclosure field money and was forced to write an IOU for 3,000 yuan in the Land Temple of Weicun, with a deadline of 500 days to pay.

<p>Local Funds Department Borrows Money to Survive: The Local Funds Department is in dire financial straits. Deputy Directors Xia Sunhu and others have resigned their posts. The County Party Department is starting its reorganization work and needs 400 yuan for operating expenses. The custodian of the committee, Xu Jiangye, has handed over all funds received during the custody period to conclude his duties, requiring 800 yuan. The second term of the District Chief Training Institute is nearing graduation, and subsidies of 150 yuan are needed. These three funds are urgently needed, so the department has borrowed 1,000 yuan from Chengfengzhuang to meet the immediate need, with the Finance Bureau providing a guarantee.</p>
<p>Local Finances in Dire Straits: Finance Bureau Director Dai Yuandu is unable to meet the demands of various agencies because revenue from taxes is meager and insufficient to cover expenses. The local funds under the grain transport item have not been collected, amounting to about 150,000 yuan. It is now proposed to follow the precedent of borrowing money during the military era, gathering leaders of various legal entities, as well as wealthy households and manufacturers, to jointly allocate and borrow 40,000 yuan for the immediate need. At the same time, regulations will be drafted to request the Finance Department to issue local bonds of 100,000 yuan, with the local fees under the grain transport item that have not been collected over the years as collateral. The local bonds will be used to repay various short-term loans, and the remainder will be used to cover the monthly shortfall. Once the original funds are collected, they will be repaid in succession. Yesterday (the 17th), it was submitted to the county for approval.</p>

<p>Implementing Reductions in Various Sub-Bureaus and Offices: The original structure of the Public Security Bureaus in this county is inconsistent with the current system. Last year, the county government submitted a request to the Civil Affairs Department to establish one sub-bureau per autonomous region, with four substations in addition to the sub-bureaus in the urban and rural areas, and to abolish all township substations. At that time, due to winter defense, people in various places requested a postponement. Now that winter defense has passed, it is necessary to implement the plan. It is reported that County Magistrate Chen has already compiled a budget and submitted it to the Civil Affairs Department for approval, planning to implement the reductions separately starting from April 1st.</p>

Upon inspecting the ornaments, it was found that they all had the markings of Gu Zhengsheng Silver Store on Zhongjie Street in the city, suggesting that they were items from nearby farmhouses. Afterwards, police officer Han Guanrong confirmed that the homes of Tao Dadi, a farmer in Shuangqiao Yisihang, and Shen A-Song, a farmer in Huajiawei, had been robbed ten days ago. The losses were not significant, but the items found matched the items seized from the two men. The victims also identified the two men as the robbers. The two thieves then confessed to colluding to commit the robberies. They have now been sent to the court for trial.</p>

<p>Riot During Temple Fair, Patrol Chief Beaten: The Lin Dong district of Yuyao is remote, with strong local customs and widespread superstition. The villagers near Wushan Temple hold a vegetarian fast and worship the gods on the fifteenth day of the second month of the lunar calendar every year. This year, as usual, the event attracted thousands of people. The head of the Henghe Public Security Bureau, Tu Shaoren, had previously issued a notice prohibiting the event. On the day, he sent patrol officer Lin Cong and eighteen officers to the temple to dissuade the crowd. However, the welcoming crowd not only ignored the warnings but also dragged Lin and the others into the temple. The head of the temple fair ordered the officers to be disarmed, stripped of their uniforms, and have their insignia removed. Their hands were tied behind their backs, and they were hung from the ceiling. They were whipped with leather whips until they fainted, then lowered, and then whipped again. This was repeated four times, leaving them on the verge of death. The other officers were also severely beaten with leather whips, suffering great pain. A peddler secretly reported the incident to the Henghe Public Security Bureau. Upon hearing the news, Director Tu, realizing that the police force was too weak, rushed to the city at night to meet with County Magistrate Miao and request instructions. County Magistrate Miao immediately dispatched patrol officer Xu Guoliang with a large contingent of police officers to rescue them. Lin Cong and the others were eventually rescued by the village chief of Tanhe Village, who knelt down and begged the rioters. After being examined for injuries at the court, they went to the Huiai Hospital for treatment. Lin lost two quick-firing guns and many bullets. The police officers sent by the county government had not returned by late evening, and their fate is unknown.</p>
<p>Rice Shop Robbed in Huxi: Dong Demao's Shunji Rice Shop on Erbanqiao in Huxi, Yongshi, owned by Dong Yicheng, has a thriving business. Yesterday (the sixteenth) at 7:00 PM, the apprentices had already closed the front door. While the shop assistants were having dinner, several robbers suddenly arrived. Two of them broke into the shop, cut the telephone line, and pulled out handguns. Dong and the others, realizing that they were being robbed, did not dare to speak up. One robber, holding a handgun, rushed to the accounting room and stole a small tin box containing foreign currency and silver coins, totaling over a hundred yuan. After the robbery, they fled towards Duanxiang Alley in the northwest.</p>
<p>Shop Owner Kidnapped: In Jiaqiao, Beixiang, Zhenhai, Wang Xiaonong, the owner and manager of the Baoxin Foreign Goods Store, and his family also lived in the store. Unexpectedly, around 11:00 PM the night before, twelve kidnappers suddenly arrived, all carrying handguns and box cannons. They kidnapped the shop owner, Wang Xiaonong. There were three or four members of the security team living in the area, but they did not dare to resist due to the robbers' ferocity and allowed them to be taken away.</p>

<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>In your newspaper's headline news on the 12th of this month, it stated, "Jiaoji Railway Buys Boshan Light Railway for Over One Million Yuan, Valued at Over Three Hundred Thousand Yuan." Furthermore, in your newspaper's headline news on the 14th of this month, it stated, "Jiaoji Railway Buys Boshan Railway," claiming that "The Japanese are preventing the Jiaoji Railway from building a branch line from Boshan to the Coal Mine, and are buying the light railway. It is reported that the purchase price has been agreed upon at 1.6 million yuan. The Ministry of Railways, unaware of the truth, is said to have approved the contract." After investigation, our ministry has not received any documents from the Jiaoji Railway regarding this matter, let alone approved any contract. However, since there are records of this, we specifically telegraphed Chairman Yan of the Jiaoji Railway, who also stated that it was absolutely not true. This proves that the news reported by your newspaper is completely fabricated. We hereby request that your newspaper make a correction.</p>
<p>Secretariat of the Ministry of Railways</p>

<p>Citywide Sports Meet Closed Yesterday</p>
<p>Athletes' Competitions Completed:: Excellent Results</p>
<p>Will Go to the National Games:: To Showcase Skills</p>
<p>Awards Ceremony Tomorrow Afternoon:: At the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citywide Sports Meet, which had been rumored for some time, began on the 13th and closed yesterday. Over the past six days, all the results have been very satisfactory. The purpose of this meet was twofold: (1) to bring together various sports competitions in Shanghai to promote teamwork; (2) to select representatives to attend the National Games. It was a unprecedented grand event. The competition committee, in view of the fact that Chinese sports have no rules for amateur and professional athletes, disqualified all athletes suspected of being professional, and did not allow them to participate. In total, three or four male and female athletes who registered to participate or were disqualified after participating were disqualified. This is truly a new era for Chinese sports and good news for the Chinese sports world. The members of the competition committee, disregarding personal feelings, served the public. This spirit is commendable, and the impact will be felt nationwide, which will help revitalize the Chinese sports scene.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the last day of the meet. The events included soccer and men's and women's tennis doubles championships. Newcomers to the tennis world, Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang, defeated Li Huitang and Liu Tieliang yesterday with scores of 6-2, 6-4, and 6-1 to win the men's doubles championship. In women's tennis doubles, Kuai Shuping and Li Yun played against Su Zuqi and Wang Dale, with scores of 3-6, 6-3, and 5-2 (Kuai and Li were ahead). Due to the late hour, the game could not be finished. The details of yesterday are described below.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Soccer Final: Huale Loses, Jinan Wins Championship <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Result: 3-0</p>
<p>The soccer final between Jinan and Huale took place at the China Baseball Field yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM. Over two thousand spectators attended, making it a very popular event. From beginning to end, Jinan adopted an enveloping and pressing tactic. Huale's defense was solid, and they managed to keep the score level in the first half. In the second half, after Zhou Xianyan and Li Ning withdrew, the defense was weakened, and Jinan scored three goals in a row, making the score 3-0. Jinan won the championship. Referee Li Silian's record of the match is summarized below.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Military Band Provides Entertainment <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>During the match, the military band invited by the organizers played intermittently in the west stand. The sound was sonorous, adding a lot of interest and opening the minds of the audience.</p>
<h3 id="e108">(2) Appearing on the Silver Screen <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>At 3:15, the two teams lined up on the field and had a film taken. The action during the match was also captured on camera for future commemoration. This film will be shown at the awards ceremony tomorrow, and the appearance of the athletes on the silver screen will surely cause a burst of warm applause.</p>
<h3 id="e109">(3) Cheering Squad Displays Power <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>All of Jinan's students came to the stadium yesterday and gathered in the east stand to carry out their cheering duties. They shouted encouragement during attacks, and the applause was thunderous when they scored. The three cheers at the start of the game were especially majestic. The Huale supporters were also numerous, and the sounds echoed in the air, creating a spirited atmosphere.</p>
<h3 id="e110">(4) Impenetrable Goal <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Jinan kicked off first and immediately took offensive measures. Huale responded calmly. For the first ten minutes, the momentum was similar, and both sides had opportunities to shoot. After that, the situation became slightly calmer. Then, Jinan became imposing and powerful, and Huale's goal became the target of all attacks, but Zhou Xianyan's skillful operation ensured that there were no mistakes. Jinan attacked again and again, unable to find a way to score. There were two clear chances to score, but they missed them, which was a pity. At the end of the first half, the score was Jinan 0, Huale 0.</p>
<h3 id="e111">(5) Iron Army Scores Three Times <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The change of sides reduced the excitement, as Li Huitang and Sun Sijing of Huale were less forceful, and the two generals Zhou Xianyan and Li Ning withdrew from the game. The momentum of the game plummeted, and Jinan attacked at will. Huale was initially penalized for a foul, and Dai Linjing scored from a penalty kick, opening the scoring. Shortly after, Tong Rongwen and Dai Linjing scored again, resulting in a 3-0 score and winning the championship.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Men's Tennis Doubles <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang Win Championship</p>
<p>The men's tennis doubles semi-finals were held yesterday afternoon at 10:00 AM. After a short break, the finals were held. As a result, Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang defeated Li Huitang and Liu Tieliang 3-0 to win the championship. The scores were 6-3, 6-4, and 6-1.</p>
<p>Semi-finals: There were two groups. In the first group, Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang were up against Li Zuxun and Guo Jingwu. However, Li and Guo withdrew, so Zheng and Yu won the right to the finals without effort. In the second group, Li Huitang and Liu Tieliang played against Liang Yong and Kuang Yiyun. As a result, Li and Liu won the right to the finals with scores of 6-2, 6-1, and 6-2.</p>
<p>Finals: Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang and Li Huitang and Liu Tieliang, who won the right to the finals, rested for ten minutes and then began to compete. Zheng and Yu were young and handsome, and their tennis skills were extraordinary. Although Li and Liu were veterans, they were not their opponents. However, they were unwilling to show weakness and worked hard to fight. The first set was 6-3, and the second set was 6-4. Victory belonged to Zheng and Yu. From this score, it can be seen that the situation was still fairly balanced. In the third set, the pair of young men launched an even more fierce attack, and Li and Liu found it difficult to defend and were defeated. Zheng and Yu won again 6-1 and won the championship.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Women's Tennis Doubles: Kuai Shuping and Li Lian Win Against Su Zuqi and Wang Dale <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>3-6:: 6-3:: 5-2</p>
<p>Due to the Late Hour, the Game Could Not Be Finished. All Four Players Have Outstanding Skills and Will Be Sent to the National Games</p>
<p>The women's tennis doubles final was held yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM. The contestants were Kuai Shuping and Li Lian against Su Zuqi and Wang Dale. All four players had good skills and performed well, but the game could not be finished due to the late hour. In the first set, Su and Wang won 6-3. In the second set, Kuai and Li won 6-3. In the third set, the score was 5-2 (Kuai and Li were ahead) when it became too dark to continue playing. However, the competition will not continue today either. The committee, in view of the excellent skills of the four players, has decided that they will all represent Shanghai at the National Games. The situation of yesterday's match is described below.</p>
<p>Evaluating the Tennis Skills: All four players have their own strengths. Relatively speaking, Kuai Shuping should be ranked first. Her shots and serves are fast and measured. Su Zuqi's defense is invaluable, and her serves are also very fast. Wang Dale is also not weak, but lacks a bit of grip. Ms. Li Lian is the most stable, making very few mistakes. The backhand shots of Ms. Kuai and Ms. Li are more stable. In short, the performances of all four were excellent and won the praise of the audience.</p>
<p>First Set: The first set started with Kuai serving first, winning a game. Then, Su and Wang's offense was very strong, winning three games in a row, taking the lead with 2-1. However, Kuai and Li did not show weakness, attacking fiercely and Ms. Li feinting to the east and attacking to the west, never missing. Ms. Kuai used powerful shots, making many achievements. Su and Wang suddenly seemed unable to withstand it, creating a score of 3-3. Then, the competition became more intense. The next game was fought for a long time, with repeated ties, making it difficult to judge the winner. Suddenly, Su's net play and Wang's shots were very accurate and fast, winning the game. Su and Wang's momentum increased and they went straight to the top, winning the first set 6-3.</p>

<p>Soccer Championship - Jinan University</p>
<p>Baseball Championship - Jiaotong University</p>
<p>Swimming Championship - Yu Binqi</p>
<p>Second Set: After losing the first set, Ms. Kuai and Ms. Li worked hard to retaliate and were indeed successful, winning two games in a row. However, after their victory, Su and Wang were unwilling to fall behind and tried hard to catch up, winning two games as well. Then, Kuai and Li won another game, and Su and Wang tied again, making the score 3-3. Kuai and Li were determined to win and worked together to attack. Kuai's strength and Li's soft ball, suddenly left and suddenly right, refused to let go. Su and Wang were so tired of defending that they collapsed, and Kuai and Li also won back the second set with a score of 6-3.</p>
<p>Third Set: With each side having won one set, the outcome was undecided. The decisive battle of the third set was inevitable. Su and Wang had a bad start, and their hand balls could not be returned, so they lost many points. Their opponents took the opportunity to attack and won three games in a row. Although Su and Wang were able to win back a game, Kuai and Li's momentum was strong, and they added to the dimming twilight, successfully winning another game, making the score 5-2. At this time, it was already dark and the lights of thousands of homes were on. The competition was terminated.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Public Pre-selection Began. Today and Tomorrow, the Competition Will Continue</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Public Pre-selection Games officially opened yesterday. At 9:30 AM, the opening ceremony was held amidst military music. Attendees included Chu Minyi, Yang Xingfo, Chen Hexian, Yu Qingtang, and hundreds of referees and male and female athletes. The event was a grand spectacle. The situation at the venue and the various results are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Venue Order <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the venue order was maintained by Gao Yunpeng, the director of the discipline department, who invited 90 Zhenjiang Boy Scouts to maintain order throughout the venue. It was extremely solemn. The eight disciplinarians were all students from the police academy, and they worked conscientiously and impartially, adding a lot of color to the event.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Opening Situation <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday, the first day of the Jiangsu Provincial Games for the Public Pre-selection began. First, the commander's platform issued an order to gather all the athletes in the venue. After the ceremony,</p>
<p>Director Yu reported that this Public Games had the participation of more than 30 counties from all over Jiangsu Province. Those in school sacrificed their studies, and those who were employed sacrificed their jobs. They participated with great excitement, making it the first time that Jiangsu had such a large scale athletic meet. Due to time constraints, the facilities were incomplete, but thanks to the enthusiasm of the gentlemen who came to the meeting, we were able to fulfill our obligations and guide everything. Mr. Yang Xingfo originally planned to leave the province today, but was retained by this meeting and is still attending today. Mr. Chu Minyi enthusiastically solicited prizes, up to more than a hundred pieces. Today, Mr. Yang took the night train from Shanghai to Zhen and personally brought a special large silver cup donated by the Shanghai business community, which is particularly touching. There are a total of 525 participants in this session, including 315 men and 44 women in track and field, and 9 soccer teams. I hope that you will work hard to participate with the four major spirits of sportsmanship, cooperation, sacrifice.</p>
<p>Chu Minyi gave a speech on the two meanings of sports: method and purpose. The methods are different for each item, but the purpose is the same: health. There is a health competition in this session, which has not been seen before. Let me explain it. Although our physical education can be measured by sports competition results, it is slightly different from health tests. What we call health competition has three aspects: (1) physical examination (2) physical strength test (3) physical fitness test. It can be called the three tests of health. What is a physical examination? It is to check height, width, weight, etc., just like the height and tonnage of a car. What is a physical strength test? It is to test each person's grip, thrust, pull, etc. It's like using a scale to weigh them. The test table will show the number, which is different from lifting stone burdens and stone locks in the past. If a stone burden is 60 jin, and this person has 70 jin of strength, then of course he has more than enough strength. If this person's strength is tested to be 30 jin, then the 60 jin of stone will naturally not be moved, and there will be no harm. Only if someone has 57 jin of strength, they try to lift 60 jin of stone, and they seem to be struggling halfway, but because of the sake of the face, they are unwilling to show weakness in front of everyone, so they reluctantly lift it up. These extra three jin of exertion are enough to cause injury, which is very dangerous. Therefore, the physical strength test is also like a car with several cylinders and how much horsepower. Overloading can easily damage the car. The fine blood vessels of the human body are very fragile. If you use too much force, they are easily ruptured, which can lead to hemoptysis. The strength test has no such danger. What is a physical fitness test? Suppose A has the same physical condition and strength as B, but the durability of work or the changes after work are different. This is the evidence of different physical fitness. For example, if five people exercise and run at the same time, their pulse, breathing, and temperature should be tested before departure. After the exercise is over, the test is repeated. If a person with lung disease has a higher temperature and pulse, etc., it will immediately increase. If the person has not returned to normal after ten minutes, then it can be seen that the person is not healthy. Therefore, increasing a person's physical fitness is to increase the life resistance. It is like a car with the same height, width, and horsepower, but its ability to travel a certain number of miles without breaking down depends on how much endurance it has. The above three points are the elements of a health competition. Gentlemen, you are here today, some from schools and some from professional institutions. Since elementary school, you have been exercising to develop the ability to serve. The various sports activities should be gradually created on weekdays, and you cannot embrace the Buddha's feet on the spur of the moment. Those who are employed have been out of school for a long time and do not seem to like sports very much, but if they can not forget the school's sports, they can increase their service durability and productivity will definitely increase accordingly. Therefore, health has a direct relationship with the national economy. If you are healthy individually, your children will be healthy. Extending from the individual to the country, the health of the nation is also the responsibility of the gentlemen present.</p>

<p>Staff and Guest Relay Race, Guard Team Martial Arts Performance</p>
<p>The health competition, initiated by Mr. Chu Minyi, uses a 100-meter race among individuals of the same age group to test their pulse and respiratory rate before starting as the standard. The increase or decrease in these rates at the finish line, compared to the starting point, is used to assess their physical fitness. Mr. Chu first invited Yang Xingfo, Chen Hexian, Yu Qingtang, Jiang Shunyuan, and Sun Daosheng, a reporter from this newspaper, to demonstrate the process. Subsequently, participants included Ms. Tao Xuan, a member of the Central Legislative Yuan, Mrs. Chen Hexian, women's champion Hu Ruisheng, and over forty other female participants. The results of each participant will be reviewed by Mr. Chu and Mr. Yang before a final decision is made.</p>
<p>Yesterday, over thirty members of the provincial government guard team gave a temporary performance of various martial arts and calisthenics, which was quite spectacular. As the competition neared its end, Yang Xingfo, Yu Qingtang, and other presenting guests participated in a 400-meter relay race. Important staff, newspaper reporters, and female school instructors, sixteen people in total, joined, divided into four groups. When the starting gun fired, participants bravely and fiercely competed. The intense competition resembled that of the games' athletes. Thunderous applause accompanied them along the way. The winning group was composed of Chen Hexian, Zheng Xigu, Sun Daosheng, and Pei Shunyuan, with a time of 1 minute 5.8 seconds.</p>

<p>The Excitement of Watching the Ball Games: Yesterday afternoon, the ball games and track and field events were held simultaneously. The referees were stretched thin and could not be adequately distributed. Fortunately, Tan Dahua and six other members of the Shanghai Qingguang basketball team arrived to participate temporarily and were asked to officiate in turn. More local residents than in previous days came to watch the ball games, crowding around the ball fields. The women's ball games, in particular, aroused great interest.</p>
<p>Yesterday Evening's Banquet: Yesterday evening, Chen Hexian hosted a banquet for the officials of the games and reporters in the education hall. More than forty people attended, including Chu Yi, Yang Xingfo, and Tao Xuan.</p>
<p>Qingguang Team Members as Referees: The Shanghai Qingguang basketball team had registered to participate in the Jiangsu Provincial People's Preliminary Meeting basketball competition. They arrived yesterday at the opening ceremony and learned that the games had decided not to allow the special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai to participate. They originally intended to return to Shanghai as a team. However, because the games had many events and urgently needed skilled assistance, the entire team was retained and is serving as referees for various events in the town.</p>
<p>Chu Minyi Arrives in Town: Chu Minyi, as the director of the awards department, solicited many prizes. He arrived yesterday morning and brought dozens of large and small silver tripods and shields. Among them, the large silver tripod donated by the Shanghai Business Community Joint Association was the most magnificent.</p>

<p>President Zhang Jingjiang entrusted Shen Shiyuan to deliver the opening speech, stating roughly that Zhejiang had not held a provincial games since the 7th year of the Republic. The vigorous spirit of the people requires a healthy body to be realized. Chinese people's physical constitution is not as good as that of foreigners, and the people of southern China are not as good as those of northern China. Zhejiang is also not as good as Jiangsu. Although this is related to culture and geography, it is also due to a lack of training. I hope that after this meeting, all athletes can continue to work hard. Next, Vice Presidents Zhu Jiahua and Chen Bulei, and Li Ximou, representative of the Ministry of Education, delivered speeches in succession, and then the competition began.</p>

<p>Actively Preparing for the National Education Conference</p>
<p>With the National Education Conference on April 15th approaching, the documentation section of the preparatory committee held a meeting at 3 PM on the 17th in the Ministry of Education conference room.

Four clerks, two shorthand reporters. (2) Receipt and dispatch of documents. (3) Storage of documents. (4) Processing of documents. For each of the above items, except for the shorthand reporters (two people), where there were concerns about the number of people being insufficient and where allocation was slightly delayed, the rest were distributed. (B) Allocation of daily office rotation duties before the meeting. (C) Recent matters to be handled (such as statistics on registered personnel; notifying the reception section as people successively register, in order to prepare reception, etc.). It is also heard that from the 18th onwards, the preparatory committee will begin working at the Ministry of Education Club location (fortunately, most of the preparatory staff are Ministry of Education employees. Apart from urgent and important ad hoc meetings, they usually come to the club around 3 PM in the afternoon for rotating office duties). All preparatory matters related to the national education conference prior to this, such as receiving and dispatching documents, etc., which were handled concurrently by the general affairs division, will be accepted and handled by the preparatory committee from the 18th onwards until the meeting site. It is heard that Central University’s buildings are currently insufficient for its own use and is negotiating to borrow the Ministry of Railways auditorium, which is largely settled. It is said that a lease has been negotiated for the third floor of the Central Hotel to be the lodging place for the conference members.</p>

<p>According to reports, at the Jiangsu Education Finance Committee meeting on the 11th of this month, Committee Member Wang proposed "The income from school accommodation fees in the 18th year should be included in the budget as a temporary and special expense for each school to avoid disputes." The first item of the resolution: "The budget for the 18th year will remain as originally planned," with the addition of "relief will be sought for the insufficient amount."

<p>Yesterday, Various Circles Commemorated the "March 18th" Massacre</p>
<p>A Memorial Meeting Was Held at the City Party Headquarters</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday, the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters convened various agencies and civic groups to hold a memorial meeting for the March 18th Massacre at the said City Party Headquarters. Over 300 representatives from various circles attended. Chen Dezheng presided, Wang Jinshan recorded, and Xu Yefu served as the master of ceremonies. After completing the rituals, Chen Dezheng delivered a report on the historical facts of the March 18th Massacre and the efforts that should be made for the March 18th commemoration. Afterwards, slogans were chanted and the meeting adjourned. The following is a record of Chen Dezheng's report:</p>
<p>"Fellow comrades, today is the March 18th Memorial Day. Everyone knows the origin of the March 18th Memorial Day. It commemorates a tragic event that occurred in Beiping on March 18th of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China (1926). During February and March of that year, Japanese imperialists, seeking to suppress the burgeoning revolutionary efforts in northern China, first unreasonably bombarded Dagu Port. They then joined with the eight nations involved in the Boxer Protocol and issued an ultimatum to the Duan Qirui government, demanding the removal of Dagu Port's coastal defenses and the cessation of all interference with the entry of foreign warships. This was tantamount to controlling China's northern coastal defense and was an extremely serious matter. If the Duan government had agreed to it, China's sovereignty would have suffered a great loss. Therefore, the people of the entire country were enraged, especially the citizens of Beiping, who feared that the Duan government would accept the humiliating ultimatum of the eight nations within 48 hours. Consequently, representatives from Beiping petitioned the Duan government on March 18th. However, Duan Qirui not only refused to accept their petition but also ordered his guards to open fire, wounding many representatives. When this news spread throughout Beiping, the citizens and students of various schools became even more furious. On the morning of March 18th, a mass meeting of Beiping citizens was held at Tiananmen Square. After the meeting, the crowd marched to Duan's private residence in Tieshizi Hutong, demanding that Duan immediately reject the eight nations' ultimatum. Duan, seeing the people's agitation, became enraged and, on the advice of figures like Zhang Shizhao, ordered the guards to open fire on the crowd from all sides, resulting in the deaths of fifty to sixty people, severe injuries to seventy to eighty, and countless minor injuries, creating an unprecedentedly bloody tragedy. This is a general overview of the historical facts of March 18th. Last year, at the West Lake Exposition, the revolutionary memorial hall displayed bloodstains from that day for us to see. From these tragic memories, we know the primary cause. Duan dared to instigate the guards to open fire and cause the tragedy because it was a manifestation of imperialist oppression of China. In other words, it was the imperialists using the hands of the Northern warlords to carry out a massacre of the revolutionary people of China. Secondly, if the Northern warlords had possessed even a shred of national spirit despite the imperialists' desire to massacre the Chinese people, they should have sternly rejected the eight nations' ultimatum long ago. The warlord government, in order to maintain its exploitative practices and its grip on power, catered to the imperialists in every way. The imperialists wanted them to do something, and they would do it. So, when the imperialists wanted them to act as executioners to massacre the Chinese people, they carried out the massacre. A third layer of meaning lies in the strange events that occurred alongside the imperialist oppression and the warlords' brutality. We know that the reason the March 18th crowd did what they did, for the crowd and students to charge with their bare hands, was due to the intentions of people like Xu Qian, who knew that under the pressure of imperialism, Duan Qirui would resort to slaughter. He had already led his family to the Legation Quarter in Dongjiaomin Lane. If he were a true revolutionary, he should not have done so. Therefore, we know that this was merely using the name of revolution to rally the masses, but in reality, it was betraying the revolution and the masses. The above points are the several important causes and facts of the March 18th event. From these, we derive the following lessons. The first lesson is that the March 18th incident occurred because imperialism sought to undermine the Chinese national revolution. Therefore, as long as imperialist oppression continues, China will not achieve freedom and equality. To achieve freedom and equality for China, we must follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and strive to attack imperialism. After March 18th, imperialist oppression of China has continued unabated. In the north, there is Russian imperialism, in the east, Japanese imperialism, in the west, British imperialism, and in the south, French imperialism. Imperialists on all sides are aiming their cannons at China, ready to open fire. They have no goodwill to offer, so we must strive to attack all imperialists. The second lesson is that the March 18th incident occurred because of imperialism on one hand and the warlords' flattery of imperialism on the other. To thoroughly seek freedom and equality for China, we must fundamentally eliminate the Northern warlords. During the eighteenth and nineteenth years of the Republic of China, Northern warlords rose and fell one after another. Now, there are still remnants of warlords, large and small, such as Yan Xishan, uniting to disrupt the country. Therefore, as long as the Northern warlords exist, China cannot have hope for freedom and equality. Thus, in commemorating the March 18th Massacre, we should be even more pained by the continued existence of the remnants of the Northern warlords. To avenge the martyrs of the March 18th Massacre, we can only fundamentally eliminate the warlords under the leadership of the central government. The third lesson is that in addition to the crimes of imperialism and the Northern warlords, the facts of March 18th also include the fact that opportunists betrayed the revolution. We must be aware of this in the course of the revolution. Since the Northern Expeditionary Army captured Shanghai, there have also been many instances of opportunists betraying the revolution and betraying the masses, such as the Communist Party reorganisation faction, who have been engaging in acts of sabotage against the Chinese revolution under various deceptive pretexts. These kinds of figures have continued to exist from March 18th until now. If we are to commemorate March 18th and preserve the glorious history of the entire revolution, we must eliminate this force of false revolutionaries. Our commemoration today is very painful. For example, the revolutionary army reached Beiping, the site of the March 18th Massacre, a long time ago, but why has the revenge for the martyrs of March 18th not yet been exacted? This is because imperialism continues to oppress our country, the remnants of the Northern warlords continue to pursue their dream of seizing territory and accumulating private armies, and the forces of false revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries who betray the revolution have not only not been eliminated, but are still using various despicable and cruel means to hinder the success of the Chinese national revolution. This is something that we should deeply recognise during this period. Therefore, I hope that our comrades understand the causes of the March 18th Massacre, remember the lessons learned from March 18th, abide by Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, and strive to complete the revolution under the leadership of the central government."</p>
<h3 id="e152">Precautions for March 18th <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was March 18th, the anniversary of the Beiping People's Revolutionary Memorial Day. The local Chinese-administered areas, due to the unsettled situation and the proliferation of rumours, announced a curfew yesterday for the sake of maintaining public order. The details of the precautions are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Nanshi: In the Nanshi area, in addition to the double patrols added to the police stations in various districts by the Public Security Bureau, armed police officers led by patrol officers were also stationed at key points to inspect vehicles and pedestrians. All members of the Nanshi Security Corps were also divided into teams to patrol the roads, and all members of the detective squad and female inspectors were also deployed in plain clothes. The curfew time would be advanced temporarily when necessary. Therefore, the Nanshi area was peaceful as usual yesterday.</p>
<p>French Concession: The French Concession police authorities issued an order the day before yesterday, instructing all detectives in all police stations to gather at their respective police stations and not to leave without authorization, so that they could be dispatched at any time. Armed Annamese police squads were also deployed to patrol the roads. All the iron gates at the junctions between the Chinese and French areas were completely closed around 7:00 PM, leaving only a few places where trams could pass through, and additional detectives were stationed to provide security.</p>
<p>Public Concession: The two areas of the Public Concession, Pudong and Puxi, where factories are clustered, were under particularly stringent precautions. Even more attention was paid between 7:00 PM and 9:00 PM in the evening. All vehicles and pedestrians had to undergo inspection, which was quite thorough.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Disturbances on Various Roads in the Public Concession Yesterday <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, sixty to seventy young men and women distributed leaflets and shouted slogans between Fujian Road and Fourth Road in the Public Concession. Upon hearing this, the Lao Zha Police Station immediately ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to suppress them. Three people were arrested. After questioning by the chief, they were released as there was no major connection. Around 6:15 PM last night, more than a hundred young students gathered at an open space on Tokyo Road in Puxi to hold a meeting. The patrol officer at that location heard about it and immediately reported it to the police station. Chinese and foreign detectives arrested eight people and took them to the police station for investigation. Around 6:30 PM, a crowd gathered at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qujiang Road, distributing leaflets and shouting slogans. Two people were arrested by the police. It was also reported that similar movements occurred in the Hongkou area, and five people were arrested by the police.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Heavy Taxation on Chinese Silk by the French and Japanese <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The National Goods Association Cables for Negotiations</p>
<p>The Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association recently sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the issue of export tax rates: "To Minister Ru Tang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Executive Yuan of the National Government in the Capital: We recently received your ministry's Yu Dai telegram, and upon reading it, we learned that in the Sino-Japanese treaty revision conference, the draft treaty proposed by our side did not have any reciprocal provisions regarding tariff matters. As for the full text of the new treaty, it is still under negotiation and cannot be copied and sent yet. We are responding specifically. Foreign Ministry Yu Yin, etc." After reading it, we were overjoyed and deeply moved by your adherence to the late Director's instructions on revolutionary diplomacy, negotiating and protecting the people's livelihood. However, at this critical moment, we cannot help but offer our sincere suggestions again, hoping to be adopted, which would be extremely fortunate. Our association has repeatedly received telegrams from various silk industry groups in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Henan, Guangdong, and other provinces, stating that our country's tariffs are bound by agreements with the great powers and have always maintained a lenient attitude. Since the opening of trade, the doors have been wide open, and all comers are welcome. The tariffs collected are extremely low, resulting in foreign goods being sold extensively for over eighty years, filling the entire country, while our inherent national goods have been overthrown and gradually declined, leading to financial exhaustion and national weakness, creating a dangerous situation. This economic oppression, if not urgently remedied, will inevitably lead to national ruin. However, foreign goods coming to China are treated with sincerity and welcome by the whole country, while Chinese goods for export are often subject to heavy taxes and are clearly rejected. For example, Japan lists Chinese silk as a luxury item and collects a heavy tax of 100% of its value. In fact, it is even more than that. The Japanese customs arbitrarily raise the assessed value of Chinese silk, sometimes exceeding the cost by 1.3 times. Therefore, since the thirteenth year of the Republic of China (1924), our Chinese silk has not been able to be imported into Japan and Korea at all. The Chinese silk industry has suffered losses of more than tens of millions. The reason for the stagnation of domestic silk in recent years stems from this. Furthermore, last year, Vietnam newly implemented heavy taxes, increasing the original amount by dozens of times, which greatly affected Chinese silk. Since then, it has disappeared from exports, and this has been going on for years. Although our country's government and people have consistently protested, there has been no success. These facts clearly show that Japan and France are intentionally disregarding us and arbitrarily cutting us off. How can we tolerate this under the rule of the Qingbai Party? At this time when the Sino-Japanese and Sino-French treaties are beginning to be revised, we earnestly request that you, Minister, exert every effort to negotiate with Japan and France regarding this heavy taxation on Chinese silk, vowing to achieve the goal of abolition. Our people throughout the country are willing to be the backing force and fight together. Moreover, in today's China, which is economically oppressed and has backward production, the great powers are all around, eyeing us covetously, invading us overtly and covertly, sparing no effort. On the one hand, they use unequal treaties to expand production and sell it to our country, using our blood and sweat to increase their production. This cycle continues, and their desires are insatiable, while our blood and sweat are exhausted. If we do not strive to revive ourselves, national ruin will follow. On the other hand, they use the policy of protecting trade by increasing taxes, obstructing the development of our country's industries in many ways, implementing heavy taxes, and rejecting the shipment of Chinese goods. Alas, what injustice in the world is greater than this? Therefore, we specifically implore you to listen carefully and earnestly request that you, Minister, adhere to your principles and do not yield in the slightest, and not stop until the heavy taxes imposed by Japan and Vietnam on Chinese goods are abolished and equal treatment is achieved. The possibility of restoring our country's foreign trade depends entirely on this single lifeline. If successful, domestic goods will still have a day to be exported, and chronic diseases may be revived. The national economy and the people's livelihood will benefit from it. Otherwise, financial exhaustion and national weakness will lead to destruction. Therefore, this move is truly related to the survival of our entire Chinese nation, and we rely on you, Minister, to single-handedly hold up the sky and save us from this catastrophe. It is not only the millions of farmers, industrialists, and businessmen who will be grateful. We read in the newspaper yesterday that the draft Sino-Japanese tariff agreement has already been signed. What is the scope of the word 'agreement'? And has the heavy tax of 100% of the value of goods shipped from our country to Japan and Korea and collected by the Japanese customs been abolished in this treaty revision, or is the tax rate the same as the tax rate we collect on Japanese goods imported into our country? Our association, like a bird startled by the twang of a bow, is frightened by the sound of the string. We dare to send a special telegram to implore and await clear instructions. Wang Jianan, Wang Xingyi, and Wang Hanqiang, Standing Committee Members of the Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association, respectfully bow."</p>
<h3 id="e155">City Social Bureau Discusses Domestic Materials for Formal Attire <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The City Social Bureau held a bureau affairs meeting yesterday to discuss practical measures for using domestically produced materials for formal attire. The general guidelines are as follows: the robe will be blue, the jacket will be black, the hat will be black for spring, autumn, and winter, white for summer, and the shoes will be black. The materials will be silk, hemp, and cotton for clothing, satin, velvet, and cloth for hats in other seasons, except for straw hats with plain black bands for summer, and satin, velvet, and cloth for shoes, as well as leather, but only leather that is confirmed to be domestically produced will be qualified. Samples of robes, jackets, shoes, and hats will be collected by the bureau from relevant factories and stores, and representatives from various circles will be invited to jointly select them. Once selected, a special name may be given to them (such as "formal attire satin" or "formal attire cloth"). The samples will also be distributed to various agencies and organizations to promote them. It is reported that the bureau has submitted the proposed measures to the city government for approval.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Suggestion to Move Henan Province Disaster Victims to the Border Regions <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Hoping for Support from Philanthropists at Home and Abroad</p>
<p>The Shanghai office of the Zhenwu Association has received two telegrams from Zhu Zhenyuan, a member of the Henan war zone disaster relief, suggesting immigration and colonization of border areas, listing detailed measures for reclamation in the Northeast. Director Wang of the office believes that this method is very effective and intends to discuss it with Chairman Xu and present it for discussion at the Nanjing headquarters meeting. The telegrams are recorded as follows: The first telegram (omitted above) stated, "In recent years, disasters have struck various provinces, especially the Northwest. While providing relief with porridge kitchens and price stabilization is helpful in the short term, it is not a thorough solution. Moving immigrants to Liaoning and Ningxia provinces is the best policy. The soil there is fertile, with black soil seven to eight inches thick. For years, people from various provinces have voluntarily gone through the border, engaged in farming, and mostly settled down with their families, not wanting to return south because life there is easier and productivity is rich. Last year, Henan Province transported about 30,000 disaster victims. All workers boarded trains at various stations along the railway. Charitable organizations in Beiping provided supplies and special trains for direct transportation free of charge. After the disaster victims arrived in the Northeast, the Northeast authorities were very willing to find ways to settle and distribute them in various places, either to rush to reclaim land, to become tenant farmers, or short-term or long-term workers. Those with skills in cement, tile, or carpentry work received even better compensation, earning up to two yuan a day. Each year, official and private disaster relief consumes a large amount of funds. If this amount of money is distributed to the disaster areas, it would be easy to pay for immigration expenses, costing only two to three yuan to move one person. The benefits are great, and the comparison is obvious. It is hoped that charitable organizations and government officials at home and abroad will work together to plan for it." Zhu Zhong kowtows, Zhen. The second telegram stated, "The Zhen telegram should have arrived. Now, the Northeast Three Provinces' measures for treating disaster victims who arrive to reclaim land are explained in detail. Rushing to reclaim land means freely occupying land in areas designated by the government, planting and providing for oneself, and not paying land prices. After ten years of paying taxes, one can receive land. Claiming land means cultivating wasteland in areas designated by the government, temporarily not paying prices, and the government will provide assistance for food, housing, farming tools, livestock, seeds, and other expenses. After three years, land prices will be paid, with loans for land prices ranging from about five jiao to one yuan per mu. For tenant farmers, all expenses for food, housing, farming tools, seeds, and livestock before the harvest in the first year are provided by the landlord. The landlord only receives 20-40% of the profits, and never half. For external tenant farmers, housing is provided by the landlord, and the rest must be prepared by the tenant farmers. The tax is at most 20-30%. Short-term workers can earn at least seven to eight jiao to one yuan per day. The working time per year is about five months, which can earn more than one hundred and fifty yuan in wages. During the downtime, the employer still provides housing and rations. Long-term workers are divided into pure hired and semi-tenant farmers. Pure hired workers are paid annually, at least sixty to one hundred yuan, and up to one hundred and fifty yuan. Semi-tenant farmers do not discuss wages but designate thirty mu of land cultivated by the employer, with the income used as the worker's remuneration, collecting about six to seven dou per mu, with each dou weighing more than sixty jin. The income from thirty mu is worth about two hundred yuan. This method is mostly used to treat old workers. New workers can also ask for it. Please investigate and plan a large-scale relocation of disaster victims." Zhu Zhong kowtows, Yuan. It is hoped that charitable organizations from all walks of life will pay attention to the immigration matter mentioned by Mr. Zhu, enthusiastically support it, and make it a success, which is a blessing for the disaster victims.</p>

<p>To Handle the Remaining Procedures for the Tariff Agreement? Denies Contacting Hirota Regarding His Appointment to China</p>
<p>Japanese Acting Minister Shigemitsu Aoi took the night express train to Beijing last night at 11:00 PM. Secretary Hayashide accompanied him. It is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 21st. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency met with Shigemitsu at the Japanese Consulate yesterday afternoon. According to him, this trip to Beijing is only to visit Ministers Wang and Song to handle the remaining procedures for the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement and there will be no meetings or other missions. Currently, the various issues in the Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty are awaiting opportunities for negotiation. Therefore, in the future, in addition to meeting with Foreign Minister Wang in Shanghai at any time, he plans to go to Beijing once a week to discuss issues such as judicial navigation rights. As for the rumors that the Japanese government will send Minister Hirota to be the ambassador to China, there is no official document and it cannot be determined. The rumor that I went to Beijing to contact the National Government about this matter is even more untrue because I have not received any instructions regarding this matter. How can I talk about it? The matter should be absolutely denied.</p>

After a long discussion, the following resolutions were made: (1) After the Dibao system is abolished, the township chiefs will be responsible for all matters related to distributing receipts and collecting taxes. (2) If there are abandoned tombs or households without heirs who have paid the taxes in advance, the township chiefs should verify the names of the households who paid the grain, the number of years, and the acreage of the land, and submit it to the district office, which will forward it to the Finance Bureau and submit it to the Department for allocation for local public use to avoid the burden of compensation. (3) In a picture where several townships are under jurisdiction, the township chief with the most jurisdiction is responsible for the collection.

<p>Reform of the Caojing Yangsi Tufang Boundaries Approved by Municipal Government Directive</p>
<p>The boundaries of maps and tufang in various districts of this city have always been extremely chaotic. After completing the surveying of the terrain of each district, the Municipal Land Bureau immediately began reorganizing them. It thoroughly reformed the boundaries of maps and tufang in the Special First and Second Districts of South Shanghai and submitted maps to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation. Now, it is learned that the Caojing and Yangsi districts have both completed land surveying. The bureau has corrected the previously inconsistent boundary maps of the two districts, and re-compiled the maps and tufang to achieve uniformity. Furthermore, because the boundaries of the two districts are particularly intricate and have areas that are difficult to discern due to submersion, for the sake of reorganization, except for the borders that are adjacent to neighboring counties and areas not yet received, which cannot be easily altered due to the difficulty of reaching a final decision, within the jurisdiction of this city, a small part of the former Tangqiao District, south of Hengzhongjing Yangjiabang, is incorporated into the Yangsi District. The land south of Xinpu Huitang and Caohejing Port and west of Shang'ao Tang in the former Fahua and Pusong districts is incorporated into the Caojing District. As such, the boundary of Yangsi District is as follows: east to Nima Tang Xuejiabang, west to Huangpu River, south to Zhuangbang Qianliangbang Pengqibang Xujiabang, north to Huangzilou Yangjiabang, Hengchongjing, Jiangjiabang. The boundary of Caojing District is as follows: east to Huangpu River, west to Shang'ao Tang, Caohejing Port, Xinjinggang Jiebang, south to Caogang Chunshentang, Xiaocaibang, Changqiao Port, north to Longhua Port, Cai Dongjing, Xinpu Huitang. The boundaries of each district are demarcated by rivers, which greatly facilitates planning and research in business operations. The bureau has already submitted a request to the Municipal Government for a directive to approve the record.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Chamber of Commerce Requests Suspension of Alkali Tax <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram yesterday to the Jiangsu Financial Commissioner's Office, stating that: "According to letters from alkali merchants Hengli, Lida, Taikang, Yongda, Liumao, Yongtai, Shunda, and other alkali factories, it is reported that the Yanhui Miscellaneous Goods Guild's tax office is monopolizing the alkali commodity tax and forcibly collecting additional levies, causing extreme alarm among our colleagues. We immediately convened a meeting, and all agreed that Chinese alkali merchants lack raw materials. Although nominally 'native alkali,' in reality, half of the alkali powder is imported from foreign merchant Brunner Mond, which is already under economic pressure. Currently, these foreign merchant alkali factories, under the guise of 'native alkali,' are established in various provinces. In addition to import tariffs on raw materials, they do not suffer the pain of being levied taxes by monopolizing merchants. Now, Chinese alkali factories already have no hope of development and are barely able to maintain themselves. How can we impose further extortion? If alkali is resisted, it will inevitably become extinct. Now the government is determined to promote domestic goods. Whenever domestic goods compete with foreign goods, they are invariably given generous rewards. However, the guild is unaware of this purpose and is allowing outside monopolists to forcibly impose additional levies, causing colleagues to have no way to appeal and no means to save themselves. Therefore, we earnestly request your association to provide relief and also to order the cessation of tax collection to support domestic goods and alleviate merchant difficulties." Based on this investigation, foreign alkali is rampant, and native alkali already has little hope of survival. The situation is real. If arbitrary and harsh levies are imposed again, the only remaining native alkali factories will inevitably face higher costs and reduced sales, not only failing to compete with foreign alkali but also potentially leading to shutdowns. This is expected. At this time, when the abolishment of likin is being implemented, this kind of evil practice of monopolizing merchants collecting taxes is even more unnecessary. Based on the above, we hereby urgently request your office to investigate and approve an order to stop it, in order to maintain the remaining line of native alkali. We are deeply grateful. The Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee respectfully reports."</p>

<p>Dalian Yingkou Route Increases Ships. The Dalian Steamship Company has seen thriving shipping business last year on Shanghai, Dalian, and Tianjin routes. Profit alone on the Shanghai route was more than one million yuan. Therefore, while new ships are being built in Japan, there are plans to expand shipping routes in China's waters, adding new South China routes, which have already been decided. Now that Yingkou is thawed and Niuzhuang has a large amount of goods, the company has decided to open a new route between Shanghai and Yingkou while Chinese ships have not fully resumed operations. Five 2,000-ton ships are planned to be deployed. The company's president, Yasuda Matsu, has come to Shanghai from Dalian with General Affairs Section Chief Shimada to discuss the expansion plan with the Shanghai president.</p>
<p>Osaka Fuzhou Line Raises Prices. The Japanese ships on the Shanghai-Fuzhou route have been doing good business in recent months. Both cargo and passengers are crowding the Osaka Company in this port, which has three ships sailing to Fuzhou. Due to the increase in passengers recently, it was decided yesterday, citing the preciousness of gold and cheapness of silver, that from April 1st, the price of first-class cabins from Shanghai to Fuzhou will be raised from 30 yuan to 36 yuan, and the price of third-class cabins will be raised from 12 yuan to 14 yuan. Tickets from Shanghai to Taiwan will be charged in Japanese yen, approximately 40% higher than the original price.</p>

The China Merchants Bureau has telegraphed back, refuting this, stating that since the accident occurred in the Yangtze River in China, negotiations should be held in Shanghai. The Daifuku Company is requested to send a fully authorized representative to Shanghai as soon as possible, or to negotiate with Mitsui &amp; Co. on its behalf. The matter will proceed after the Japanese side responds.</p>

<p>Available from March 20th with a Seven-Day Validity Period</p>
<p>Liu Chengchang, General Manager of the Traffic Department of the Two Railways Administration, believes that the scenic spots along the two railways are numerous. Now, with the beautiful spring scenery, it is a great time for the public to admire the mausoleum of the Premier, adjust their spirits, and enjoy the mountains and rivers. Therefore, he specially submitted a request to the director and, starting from the 20th of this month, issued first, second, and third-class round-trip sightseeing tickets between Beijing and Shanghai, between Shanghai North Station and Hangzhou, between Shanghai South Station and Hangzhou, and between Fanwangdu and Hangzhou. The original validity period was set at four days. To facilitate passengers, it has been uniformly changed to seven days from the date of issuance. It is heard that the prices are the same as the current ones. For example, a round-trip ticket between Shanghai and Nanjing on an ordinary train is 15.6 yuan for first class and 7.8 yuan for second class. A round-trip ticket on a special express train is 19.2 yuan for first class and 9.6 yuan for second class, plus a 5% surcharge for traffic improvement.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Dispute Over Using Concession Water and Electricity in Yuqing Lane, Zhabei <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Yuqing Lane on North Sichuan Road is entirely located in the Chinese territory. Previously, because the Chinese water pipes and electric wires had not yet reached, the lane used the water and electricity of the concession. The lane originally had five back doors leading to Changchun Road, so Chinese police officers were also stationed there for patrol. In the spring of the 16th year, when the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai and was in the initial stage of takeover, for some unknown reason, the owner of the lane, Li Jigu (said to be the youngest son of Li Hongzhang), suddenly completely blocked the original back doors and hired concession gatekeepers and patrolmen. Unexpectedly, this caused the concession authorities to levy patrolman fees. The lane then reopened the blocked back doors to resist the payment of patrolman fees. There has always been a precedent between the Chinese and concession areas that houses on the boundary that can通达reach the Chinese territory are under the jurisdiction of the Chinese territory, and the concession has no right to interfere. However, the Public Works Bureau stated that if the fees were not paid, the water supply would be cut off and the electricity flow would be terminated, causing great panic among the residents. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, recognizing that the recovery of the lane's water and electricity could not be delayed, immediately supervised the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to connect the lane's water pipes and negotiated with the Concession Electric Company to recover the lane's electricity supply. At the same time, it negotiated with the owner to voluntarily switch to Chinese water and electricity. Unexpectedly, the concession authorities showed some agreement, but the Li owner ignored it. In September of the 17th year, the Public Utilities Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and Finance Bureau jointly sent a letter to the owner, advising him to take into account national sovereignty and switch to Zhabei water and electricity. However, his family, using the excuse of leaving Shanghai, returned the original letter. Subsequently, the Public Security Bureau ordered the police to personally deliver the letter to his Western rent collector, Aierde, who also refused to accept it. The case has been suspended for years without resolution. In January of the 19th year, because the lane was building new houses, the Public Utilities Bureau again instructed the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to negotiate with the Shanghai Electric Power Company to recover the lane's electricity supply. As a result, the Electric Power Company first transferred the households in the lane to the Zhabei Company, which was somewhat resolved. As for the water supply, the Zhabei water pipes had previously been connected to Changchun Road and recently extended from Changchun Road to Sichuan Road. Therefore, the new houses there could have used Zhabei tap water. However, the Li owner again blocked the back doors of the new houses and entrusted the Concession Water Company to install water pipes, resulting in the conflict between Chinese police and Japanese police reported yesterday. At the time, Chief Qu of the Fifth District, First Precinct, argued reasonably and opened the back doors, so there should be no problem with police authority. However, it is not known whether the Li owner can repent and voluntarily switch to Chinese tap water to preserve a share of sovereignty for the country. The joint letter from the Public Utilities Bureau, Finance Bureau, and Public Security Bureau to the Li owner on September 19 of the 17th year is excerpted below: We hereby inform you that the North Sichuan Road Yuqing Lane, owned by your organization, is located in the Chinese territory, but the use of water and electricity from the Public Concession has caused the Public Works Bureau to levy patrolman fees, which residents resist paying. This is extremely detrimental to national sovereignty. I believe that you are a national citizen who loves and protects national rights and should share the same enthusiasm. You should remove the concession water and electricity in the lane immediately and have it supplied by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company in order to save the situation and prevent aggression. The company has long been prepared to supply water and electricity to the lane, and the prices are the same as those in the concession. You only need to notify them to install it to make it happen. Furthermore, Yipin Lane on Baoshan Road is owned by the foreign merchant Yipin Bank. It also used concession tap water, but the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company recently recovered the supply with the order of this Public Utilities Bureau, and the bank did not object since the lane belongs to the Chinese territory. Since the lane is Chinese property, there is even less reason to use concession water and electricity and harm national rights. We have specially prepared this letter to inform you. Please reply so that we can instruct the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to lay pipes and supply electricity to the residents. Sincerely, Mr. Li Jigao.</p>

<p>[PRequest to Amend Electricity Regulations Adopted and Explained Separately by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has supervised and controlled the installation of electrical equipment in the city, and has issued five types of regulations successively: Regulations for the Management of Electrical Material Stores and Electrical Contractors, Detailed Rules for the Punishment of Violations by Electrical Material Stores and Electrical Contractors, Regulations for the Management of Electricians and Apprentices Installing Wires for Electrical Users, Regulations for Indoor Wiring for Electrical Users, and Regulations for the Inspection of Electrical Equipment in Public Places. Each has strict provisions. In the middle of last month, the Water and Electricity Industry Branch of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee, believing that the regulations and the Guidian Business Regulations of the Chinese Electric Company were detrimental to the future development of electrical appliances, submitted 36 items that should be amended, along with the reasons, to the Public Utilities Bureau through the Chamber of Commerce for review. The content of the submission included requests for reduced fees, requests for extended deadlines, requests for the complete deletion of certain articles in certain regulations, and requests for the strict enforcement of already stipulated articles. The situation was quite complicated. After careful review, the bureau believed that, except for three items—the deadline for electrical material stores and contractors to retrieve their security deposits, the notification procedure after electrical equipment inspection fails, and the grace period for electricians or apprentices to renew their licenses annually—which could be adopted, the rest lacked sufficient reason. It was learned yesterday that the reasons in the original submission have been explained item by item and sent to the Chamber of Commerce for reference and notification.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Prohibition of Building Straw Houses on Roadside Land <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The Police Department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways issued a notice yesterday to the police chiefs of each section, stating that: "According to the Administration Bureau's Instruction No. 265, the General Affairs Department reported that, after checking, it was found that villagers often build straw houses on the surplus land of various stations along the two railways. This not only infringes on property rights but also hinders aspects of appearance, sanitation, fire prevention, and public security. This bureau has repeatedly proposed to clear them, but the villagers, due to livelihood concerns, are content with their makeshift arrangements and refuse to demolish and relocate within the specified time, causing the reorganization plan to be frustrated. Recently, for example, the straw houses near the Nanjing freight yard suddenly caught fire. According to the bureau's reports, the police section was ordered to prohibit rebuilding. However, rent collector Liang Tianyou reported that when he went to Jiaxing to collect rent, he heard that a straw house had been lost to carelessness on the surplus land and rushed to investigate. Three straw houses had already been rebuilt. It seems that after being built and burned, they are built again. The stations face the risk of fire, and the straw houses cannot be cleared. It is proposed to order the police of each section to strictly prohibit the construction of new straw houses on the roadside land in the future. If straw houses are burned, the rebuilding must be strictly prohibited. Is this appropriate? Please, Director, review and implement accordingly." Based on this, it is hereby ordered to the police chiefs of each branch of the two railways police to pay attention. In the future, the construction of new straw houses on the roadside land, whether rebuilt or newly built, must be strictly prohibited to avoid danger and facilitate the promotion of railway administration. This is extremely important.</p>

<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau investigated the Shanghai newspaper report of a "scientific eyeglasses scam" by the Taili Foreign Firm. Also, the American "Light of Salvation" advertisement published in various newspapers on March 13 and March 14 was investigated by personnel. It was reported that the eyeglasses were sold by the Maochang Eyeglasses Store and had conspicuous advertising flags. According to the store clerk, the eyeglasses were made by scientists at the American Taili Foreign Firm and boasted various advantages, many of which were unbelievable. It was observed that wearing these eyeglasses would likely be harmful rather than helpful, and the materials were of poor quality but the price was high, as reported in the Shanghai newspaper. Such insinuations of foreign merchants, using the name of science to deceive the world and swindle money, are truly inappropriate. It is requested to prohibit them. The bureau immediately dispatched personnel with a letter to the Public Security Bureau to order a thorough investigation and prohibition, and at the same time, it sent a letter to various newspapers to withdraw the advertisement to prevent the public from being deceived.</p>

<p>One Wave Subsides, Another Rises</p>
<p>Wang Yingwu Does Not Sue Wu Zhaoyi, Wu Zhaoyi Sues Chang Yunheng. The Shanghai stage production of the Peking opera "Xunyang Tower," with Gao Qingkui playing Song Jiang and Wang Yingwu playing the general, premiered on the fifteenth night. Wang, the actor, was slightly late in putting on his hat, causing a slight disruption. After the performance, Gao and Wang had a quarrel backstage. Wu Zhaoyi, Gao's bodyguard, intervened and brandished a handgun, appearing ready to act. Chang Yunheng, the backstage manager, dissuaded them. Wang, unwilling to accept this, reported it to the police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Wu and seize opium paste and other items from Gao's residence. They were handed over to the Provisional Court, which ordered Wu to be detained and the opium paste and other items to be confiscated. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Wu was detained until 7 pm the day before yesterday, when his lawyer, Fan Gang, applied to the court for bail. The original trial judge, Gao Junxiang, approved the bail of 100 yuan, and Wu was released. Thus, he did not experience the flavor of a prison cell overnight. Yesterday afternoon at 2 pm, Judge Gao reopened the hearing. Wu surrendered himself as scheduled. However, the plaintiff, Wang Yingwu, had been persuaded by friends and did not want to pursue the case. He requested the withdrawal of the charges in court. Judge Gao approved the request. Thus, the matter was over. However, Wu Zhaoyi suddenly filed a lawsuit in court, suing Chang Yunheng. The judge considered this a separate case and would review it later. Truly, as the saying goes, "One wave has just subsided, and another rises."</p>
<h3 id="e189">Xing Zhigang's Letter Requesting the Removal of Obstacles in the Navigation Channel <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Xing Zhigang and others, representing ship owners in Pudong and Puxi, submitted a document to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting the removal of obstacles in the navigation channel. The document stated that the navigation channel has been repeatedly obstructed and pleaded for the respective elimination of these obstructions to benefit shipping and travel. It noted that the Pudong and Puxi areas are vast, and all the ships from various cities and towns, after arriving in Shanghai with the tides, used to dock at the Nan Huiguan Wharf and the Wanyu Gongyi Wharf without any issues. However, the Wanyu Wharf has become dilapidated and collapsed over the years, making it impossible to dock there. Consequently, many ships gather around the Nan Huiguan area. Furthermore, large kiln cargo ships that used to dock at Xuejiabang and Santai Wharves have also occupied these wharves to load and unload goods, causing ships from Pudong and Puxi to anchor far out in the river, with no wharves to rely on. The most egregious issue is that lumber merchants along the Huangpu River scatter various timbers on the river surface, extending beyond the dredging line by several tens of feet. When ships arrive, passengers have to walk on uneven timber rafts to get ashore, which is very dangerous when the tide surges. Such a perilous situation can only be truly appreciated by those who have experienced it firsthand. Moreover, when passengers disembark from the ships, they face another obstacle: groups of old women from the dock rowing teams gather and stand on the gangplanks of each ship as the tide recedes, extorting one copper coin from each passenger. Those who refuse to pay are blocked from passing, preventing the public from proceeding, and some are even pushed into the river. These abhorrent practices are particularly detestable. All of the above situations constitute obstacles to navigation. As municipal reforms are underway, attention should also be paid to the security and order on the waterways. Therefore, this petition is respectfully submitted to your office, earnestly requesting that you promptly instruct the cargo ships to return to their original wharves, restrict the lumber merchants from piling up timber, and eliminate the old women of the boat crews who extort money, so that travelers from the surrounding villages can embark and disembark safely, without any danger. This is what the petitioners earnestly pray for day and night.</p>

<p>The Zhu Brothers Are Heartless</p>
<p>Cai Fengying, a 19-year-old woman from Changzhou, lost both parents and worked at the Unified Yarn Factory in Xiaoshadu. She lived with Zhu Pan, a woman at 23 Fengyu Lane, Hanzhong Road, whom she considered her godmother. However, Zhu Pan's husband, Zhu A'er, and his brother, Zhu A'mao, were pimps. Seeing that Fengying was vulnerable, they took her to Hankou on May 12th of last year, intending to sell her into a brothel. When that failed, they came to Shanghai and sold her to her cohabitant, Ru A'er, as his wife for 130 yuan. Ru was very considerate and gentle towards his young wife, so Fengying vowed to live with him until old age. Unexpectedly, the Zhu brothers and their wives had ulterior motives. For days, people came to inquire about Fengying, observing her character. Fengying became suspicious and sensed that this was not a good omen. She immediately reported to the Second Precinct of the Fourth District, and the police arrested Zhu Pan. The others escaped. Ru A'er was summoned to the station, and both were sent to the local court for a thorough investigation yesterday.</p>

<p>Xiao Huaiqing, a 31-year-old man from Tianjin, resides in Lujia Ferry, Pudong, and works as an inspector for the sanitation department. His wife, Zhang, is only 19 years old and is from Taizhou, Jiangbei. Zhang dislikes her husband for being old and is unhappy, so the couple often quarrels. At 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, the two had another argument over family matters, which escalated into a physical fight. People intervened and broke it up. Xiao then went to work at the sanitation department and did not return until 8:00 PM. Zhang was worried that something had happened to her husband and was very anxious. A local scoundrel, Xiao Shunzi from Yangzhou, claimed that Xiao Huaiqing was somewhere and that he could take her to find him. Zhang believed him and went with him. Unexpectedly, Xiao Shunzi took her to the Sen Tai Inn in Lannidu, where he booked a room, lured Zhang into the room, took off her clothes, and forcefully had his way with her. Zhang could not resist and had to endure his abuse for about an hour. Xiao Huaiqing tracked them down and arrived, asking Zhang why she was there. Zhang then told him what had happened. Xiao immediately reported to the police, who arrested the couple. The chief of the Third District questioned them and, finding that the case involved enticement, sent the defendants to the local court for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e194">A Quack Doctor Old Woman Was Swindled <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Thief Caught on the Way, Sentenced to Two Months in Prison</p>
<p>Liu Jinlin, a 24-year-old man from Hunan, went to the house of Shao Wang, an old woman who worked as a quack doctor, at 1 Wu Xing Lane, Beile Road, in the French Concession several days ago. He swindled her out of forty pieces of clothing, including a gray squirrel fur cheongsam, worth over two hundred yuan, which he pawned for money and fled. The victim reported the incident to the police station, requesting an arrest. The victim found him and brought him to the police station. After questioning by the police chief, he was ordered to be detained while the stolen goods were retrieved. Yesterday, he was sent to the French Court. Judge Zhu heard the case in the criminal court. The plaintiff, Shao Wang, stated that on the morning of the 13th of this month at 10:00 AM, the defendant came to her house and said that he was a servant of the Wang Mansion on Julida Road. Because the young lady of the house was ill, they had sought treatment from many famous doctors without success and had even consulted a hospital that demanded 1,200 yuan in medical fees. The young lady was willing to pay 800 yuan, but the hospital still refused, so she did not receive treatment. Now, he had come to ask her to provide medical treatment, and if she could cure the young lady, she would receive a large reward, which would also be beneficial for her. After speaking, he left. Then, at 2:00 PM that afternoon, he came again, looking very anxious, and said that the young lady was watching a movie at the Paris Cinema and that she should wear fancy clothes and quickly go to the mansion to wait. If she did not wear good clothes, she might be stopped by the gatekeeper from entering. Seeing his urgent manner, the woman believed him. She borrowed four pieces of clothing, including a gray squirrel fur cheongsam, from her neighbor and returned home.</p>
<p>She put them on, but the defendant suddenly claimed that she was a quack doctor and did not need to wear such good clothes. She should wear her old, tattered clothes, but leave the fur clothes at home temporarily. If the young lady saw that her clothes were old and looked down on her, she could come back home and change. The woman deeply believed him and wore her old clothes, following him to the Wang Mansion to treat the illness. Unexpectedly, when they arrived in front of the Paris Cinema, the defendant falsely claimed that the young lady was inside watching a movie and asked her to wait at the entrance for a moment until the young lady came out and they would go to the mansion together to treat the illness. After a while, the defendant suddenly disappeared. At that time, the woman became suspicious, knowing that something was wrong. She immediately returned home and was shocked to find that the defendant had taken the opportunity to go to her house and swindle her daughter out of all the clothes. Upon learning this, the woman was extremely frightened and immediately reported it to the police station. She then sent people to search everywhere and finally found him on the street several days ago, reported the incident to the police, and arrested him. However, the woman had been greatly frightened and had not been able to eat or sleep for three days and nights. The defendant's actions were in violation of the law, and she requested a severe investigation. When questioned, the defendant Liu Jinlin admitted to swindling the clothes without denial. Judge Zhu sentenced Liu to two months in the Western Jail as a warning and ordered the stolen clothes to be returned to the plaintiff.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Case of Abusing a Maid <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>After Appeal, the Original Sentence of Two Years Imprisonment Was Overturned</p>
<p>Feng Ye, a widow from Guangdong residing in Hongan Lane, Haining Road, was previously arrested by the police and sent to the Provisional Court for beating her maid, Liu Ying, after Wan Xu, a woman living in the same building, reported the incident. She was sentenced to two years in prison, as reported earlier. However, Feng Ye was not satisfied with the sentence and hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to file an appeal. The appellate court held a hearing on the case the other day. According to the accuser, Wan Xu, she knew that Feng Ye often beat the maid, and on the eighth day of the first month, she severely beat Liu Ying again and poured cold water on her head. She felt that this was unjust, so she reported it to the police. Lawyer Zhan then asked if she had seen the beating. The woman replied that Feng Ye had closed the door when she was beating the maid, so she only heard crying. He then asked how she knew that cold water had been poured on her head if the door was closed. The woman replied that after she reported the incident to the police, she and the police went into the appellant's room and saw a basin of water and water on the floor, so she assumed that water had been poured on her. According to the witness Yi Ye, the appellant was her fourth aunt, and the girl was fostered in the appellant's house and was treated very well, with no abuse at all. Judge Chou ordered Liu Ying to be brought in for questioning. At first, the girl only cried and refused to speak. The police lawyer claimed that this was because the appellant was in court, so the girl was afraid to speak frankly. Judge Chou immediately ordered the bailiff to take the appellant out of the courtroom and told Liu Ying not to be afraid and to speak truthfully. The girl then said that although she was often beaten, it was not very painful and that she did not want her foster mother to be convicted and imprisoned because of this. The debate then began. Lawyer Zhan argued that the appellant's beating of Liu Ying was an undisputed fact, but that beating a daughter was a form of parental supervision over the conduct of their subordinates and was a remedy for parents and teachers to correct the misconduct of their children. The issue that should be studied was whether the appellant's exercise of this supervisory power was appropriate and whether it exceeded the necessary extent.</p>
<p>He argued that the appellant had only given a slight reprimand at the time, which was certainly not as severe as the witness Wan Xu had said. Moreover, Wan Xu's testimony was full of contradictions and was not credible. As for Yi Ye's behavior, it could be seen that the appellant did not have excessive behavior towards Liu Ying. Furthermore, this case was sentenced according to Article 293 of the criminal law, and Article 302 of the same law required a formal complaint. Although Liu Ying was young, she was knowledgeable and had already expressed that she did not want to punish the appellant, so this case could not be established. He requested that the original sentence be overturned and the appellant be declared innocent. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Chou and Assessors Shen and Li announced the verdict in court, overturning the original sentence and releasing the appellant.</p>
<p>[P] Car Driver Violated Regulations and Scolded Police Officer, Paid Two Dollars as Fine and That Was The End of It</p>
<p>Car Driver Wu Bangxian drove his car on French concession a few days ago.</p>
<p>Because the driver violated regulations, Police Officer No. 574 found it, recorded the number, and reported it to the police chief. The patrol was dispatched yesterday to summon Wu to the French Court for investigation. Police Officer No. 574 first stated that the defendant was driving in violation of regulations that day, and when he went forward to question him, he was insolent, so he recorded the number and requested an investigation. When questioned, Wu said that it was actually the passenger who insulted the police officer, and he did not dare to resist, so he begged for leniency. The officer ordered Wu to pay two dollars as a warning.</p>

<p>Four Years Imprisonment and Four Hundred Yuan Fine</p>
<p>Zhang Jisheng from Wuxi was convicted due to illegally taking the property of other people, and he was sentenced to six months in prison and fined two hundred yuan by the Provisional Court. Later, Zhang's wife, Mrs. Zhong, tried to seek a way to get her husband exempted from the sentence since her husband was getting old. Therefore, Chen Shilin from Nanjing, who had been gambling, took the opportunity to collude with Peng Ruilun, who came from the same hometown as Zhang, and repeatedly went to Zhang's house at 1413 Wuzhou Road from the 3rd to the 8th of this month. Chen and Peng sweet-talked Mrs. Zhong, saying that if they took hundreds of gold, they could get him released. Mrs. Zhong gave them 216 yuan. Chen also said that Zhang would be released within a week. When the date came, there was no effect. Mrs. Zhong asked Chen to return the previous money. Chen not only did not return it, but also threatened her. Therefore, she reported to the Harbin Patrol Station a few days ago. The patrol was dispatched to Qinglian Pavilion in Fuzhou Road and arrested Chen and Peng. They were sent to the Provisional Court for investigation yesterday. First, Mrs. Zhang Zhong stated the situation of being defrauded. Later, witnesses Tang Ziquan, Yin Jingen, and others testified that they all witnessed the payment. Chen Shilin also said that he could insure. When asked, Chen denied it, but Peng said that he had been fooled by Chen. Judge Xu concluded the interrogation and sentenced Chen for the crime of defrauding property, sentenced to four years in prison and fined 400 yuan. Peng was found not guilty. It was also ordered that Chen and Peng jointly return 216 yuan to Zhang Zhong.</p>

There was a surplus, but the three Zhu brothers wanted to divide up the profits, but they failed to achieve their goal, and clashed with Wang and beat Wang, making huge threats, wanting to borrow five thousand yuan. Wang Xingsen then extended Liu Xiang and Zhang Zhuchen to file a criminal complaint against Zhu. The Provisional Court Judge Wang Jianzu gathered the hearing several times. The verdict was announced yesterday morning. Judge Wang said that he would consider the fact that the two sides have been in the store for three generations and are acquaintances, so he would leniently punish them, notifying Zhu Xuecai that he was innocent, and Xuede and Xueren were each fined one yuan, and ordered the two defendants to prepare a table of wine worth fifteen yuan, and invite Wang Xingsen to a banquet to show their apology and to resolve their slight suspicions and restore their inherent feelings between the wine glasses. It is said that Judge Wang is sincere and considerate and good at making peace.</p>

It was found that Wei went to Pu Yuanhui Piaozhuang at 144 Sanheli, Jiangxi Road at 10:30 am on December 16 last year and robbed 620 silver dollars, etc. Then Wei confessed that Chen Shizhong was also a co-conspirator in the case.

<p>Reading by Candlelight Caused the Disaster, Died After Being Sent to the Hospital</p>
<p>The Fang family at 252 Chongqing Road suddenly caught fire on the evening of the 10th of this month. At that time, only Fang Zi Wensheng was reading in the room by candlelight. He was careless and the candle fell on the table, igniting the book, which spread instantly and was impossible to approach. Wensheng also had no way to escape and died in the fire. When the firefighters arrived and put out the fire, Wensheng still had a breath. His uncle Wenliang still hoped to save him and sent him to the hospital, but there was no way to treat him.

One finger accidentally inserted into the trigger guard, holding on tightly, preventing the second shot. The detectives then rushed forward together, apprehended him, seized the gun, and brought him and his mistress back to the precinct. After stern interrogation by Warden Wang, the bandit confessed to being 38 years old, from Yancheng, and currently residing at No. 16, Fuxing Lane, Pingji Road in the concession.

His mistress, when questioned, identified herself as Li Baobao, 20 years old, from Yangzhou, and formerly a prostitute at the Qinglian Pavilion on Fourth Avenue. She claimed that Wang had redeemed her and that it had not been a month yet, and that she was unaware that Wang was a bandit, pleading for leniency.

<p>Yesterday I read in your newspaper that the Shanghai Seafood Trade Association, formerly known as the Xiangye Jiyi Public Association, which was organized by our colleagues, was renamed the Shanghai Special Municipality Seafood Trade Association. Yesterday, the colleagues held a reorganization meeting, and the two members of the Business Rectification Committee, Fan and Deng, guided the meeting. After checking, it was a tea party on that day, and the Business Rectification Committee did not send anyone to guide it. It is believed that this is a misunderstanding of the rumors. Please correct it immediately to show the truth. To the chief writer of the Shen Bao, from the Shanghai Special Municipality Seafood Trade Association, March 18.</p>

<p>Door Ticket for Waste Utilization The famous musician, Ms. Anna, recently held a concert in Moscow. Her admission tickets were unique, using old items instead of gold coins, and costing six pounds of rags, waste paper, lead cans, fish bones, and old boots. Those who heard about it couldn't help but smile. In fact, the government intends to collect waste for utilization to enrich the national treasury.</p>
<p>Lament of the English Pastor The senior students of Oxford University have recently become popular with wearing red and blue clothing, imitating the American movie star Ronald Lo, and competing to grow beards. This American-style craze will spread everywhere. The stubborn pastors in English capital are all lamenting, saying that it is a great worry for the world and the human heart.</p>
<p>Resolution of the Barber Conference The Austrian city of Wei recently held a barbers' conference. The chairman said that the popularity of safe self-use knives in recent years has deprived us of a part of our business. It is our great enemy and we should seek ways to resist it. It was resolved to persuade customers not to keep William-style mustaches and to shave completely so that they can grow easily and our business can recover.</p>
<p>New outfit for women's bathrobes Women's bathrobes have always used tight-fitting suits. When worn, the hidden places are vaguely visible, and after bathing, the water sticks to the flesh, making the lower body more realistic, which is not elegant. Since last year, clothing stores in various countries have tied a wide cloth hanging from the chest. It is expected to become popular soon.</p>
<p>Results of the Hell Exam After the semester exams in the capital of Hungary's primary schools, the results were posted and sent to the families of each student.

<p>— Dai Xiaozhong</p>
<p>Since the National People's Party leader Gandhi in India actively implemented a non-violent resistance policy to seek independence and freedom for the Indian people, the world has been shocked and the great powers have been watching, attracting much attention. Recently, the bathing festival was held in SANGAME, a holy place in India. Everyone left their lanes, and the whole country went crazy. The number of participants was about 3.5 million. The enthusiasm of the Indian people for religion is evident. The bathing festival is bizarre and colorful. The Times recently reported it in detail, which is quite interesting. I have translated a few excerpts for readers to discuss.</p>
<p>Barbers Prosper Tenfold. A single hair is but a drop in the ocean, yet the Indian people regard it as precious as a jade disc. It is said that if a person donates a hair and throws it into the Ganges River, he can be spared ten thousand reincarnations. Young widows believe this even more firmly. When the time comes, they entrust their three thousand strands of sorrow to a single cut, without hesitation. As a result, three thousand barbers are overwhelmed and unable to cope. In an instant, countless believers are as bare as Niu Mountain after being濯濯 (deforested).</p>
<p>Seeking Heavenly Blessings Leads to Ruin and Destitution. When tens of thousands of people worship and pray, and the heat of their devotion reaches the boiling point, some believers donate their belongings to priests in exchange for intangible happiness. Afterwards, they do not hesitate to turn to charitable organizations or the local police for help. Their foolish sincerity is unmatched. Local officials find it particularly difficult to deal with these believers.</p>
<p>Treading on Burning Fire: A Grand Self-Sacrificing Performance. The most amazing and breathtaking performance during the bathing festival is undoubtedly the fire-walking performance. All believers who are well-versed in this practice take this opportunity to show off their skills. First, they tie their feet to a three-legged frame, hang upside down, their heads only a foot away from the ground. A large pile of burning fuel is placed on the ground, and the flames are raging, but the performer's expression is normal, as if not feeling the slightest pain. However, this is not enough to be surprising. One SWANMI is able to walk barefoot on a pile of burning coal with thousand-foot flames, as if walking on flat ground, talking and laughing freely, and taking it as a pleasure. It is truly a spectacle.</p>

<p>— Tao An</p>
<p>Elegiac couplets, although a minor skill, require ingenuity and clever ideas. The books contain many fine works that are not mundane or afflicted with obscure allusions. Works that are both outstanding and free from these faults are rare. I happened to visit Mr. Cheng Lenglin at 蠖廬 and had a long conversation with him about ancient and modern times to relieve my loneliness. Then, we touched on the art of couplets. He told me two elegiac couplets, whose author I do not know. The sentences are simple, and the meaning is elegant. I recorded the actual conversation to share with readers. The couplets are:</p>
<p>"Eighty-two years, muddled and confused, a scholar or a doctor? The flowing water is merciless, let it go.</p>
<p>September 1st, clear and distinct, the dream is over, the drunkenness is over, pick a flower and smile, wait for me to return."</p>
<p>"(One)</p>
<p>"The fate of husband and wife, unfinished in this life, will be completed in the next.</p>
<p>The debt of children, borrowed by two, repaid by one." (Two).</p>

<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Recently, many painters have vowed to paint Buddha images. Qian Binghe of Wuxing is one of them. Binghe's Buddha images have different appearances, washing away the disease of dullness. One day, he painted a Buddha sitting under a bodhi tree. After completion, he hung it up and stared at it, and suddenly laughed. It turned out that it looked exactly like the comedian Xu Zhuodai. Knowing that I often associate with Zhuobao, he immediately inscribed it and entrusted it to a mounting shop, asking me to give it to him. The inscription is quite readable, saying: "Thirty years in Shanghai, suddenly opened up a different idea. Preaching with a brush, regretting the past. Floating and sinking in politics, disturbing people's affairs. Karma cycles, quicker than shadows. Nowhere to avoid Qin, the fisherman sighs in vain. Sitting quietly in meditation, away from the dust. Playfully imitating the respected face, mounting it into a Buddha image. A celebrity incarnated, the abbot of an ancient temple. Dense forest, deep mountain, plump body, broad mind. Not worth a smile, just for pure appreciation."</p>
<p>In his later years, Wu Changshuo enjoyed great fame. Even people from Japan were honored to obtain his works. However, when Wu was living in Wuxia, he was impoverished. At the end of the year, he could not even afford a dou of wine and a chicken to comfort himself. So, he painted a four-foot-long painting, with one fish, one chicken, one pig's trotter, and one jar of wine. After finishing the painting, he added a playful inscription and asked his servant to take it to the market to sell it. He got three gold coins, which were enough to buy chicken, fish, pig's trotter, and a jar of wine. This was because prices were lower at that time, unlike today. Wu Changshuo was drunk and slept soundly until New Year's Day, when he woke up to the sound of firecrackers ringing in the new year. Wu Changshuo considered it the only happy thing in his life and often mentioned it when talking with friends.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Along the way, there are signs that say "Taoist Temple", but they are actually opium dens. Is there any Tao in this? The name is elegant. Some people run public opium dens, some are rickshaw pullers, buying rickshaws and renting them to locals and collecting taxes, and some are brothels. There is a large shed labeled "Chinese Men and Women Technical Troupe." There are various small vendors, such as those selling bamboo 地牟 cows near the Guangzhou Bund. When released, they make a營營 sound, and children gather to watch. There are many musical instruments in the store. I hope someone will advocate for a national music association to influence society through art. There are also Jingwu Athletic Association and other sports associations. If society can be transformed through sports, art, and music, the effect will be great. There are many pharmacies selling plasters, pills, powders, and ginseng, as well as small fortune-telling shops for men and women. Some are called female Taoist fortune-tellers. Superstition is universal, both in the East and the West. In the Xujiahui Catholic Church in Shanghai, there are many bronze and clay sculptures and colorful paintings of heaven and hell, all variations of Buddhist monks. In the Sensoji Temple in Asakusa, Japan, there are dozens of fortune-tellers, especially female ones. But France and Japan are not harmed in their prosperity. Now, there are many conflicts in our country because of this. It is important to implement things in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>People here have breakfast at 11 am, take a nap at 12 pm, and get up after 2 pm. But it is difficult to say for laborers. In the afternoon, I visited the product exhibition hall of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, which is quite impressive. This is the center of the overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Most overseas Chinese families worship Guan Gong. This originated with Shanxi merchants. Shanxi merchants are everywhere, and there are Guan Gong temples everywhere, which are also chambers of commerce. Guan Gong was from 解州, Shanxi. Because of his loyalty and righteousness, he is admired by the people of Shanxi. This spread throughout the country through merchants. The reason why merchants especially worship him is because Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei became sworn brothers, sharing interests and life and death without wavering, which is a good model for forming partnerships to start businesses in distant lands. They gather at Guan Gong temples every year to calculate accounts and to warn people's conscience. The overseas Chinese have adopted this and promoted its spirit globally, forming a Guan Gong religion. Everything arises from need, and it is not accidental. Also, those overseas are lonely without organizations, making it difficult to survive. To form an organization, a name must be chosen. The righteousness of Taoyuan is a good model for sworn brotherhood and a successful organization that should not be criticized. Our people have not been able to acquire the knowledge of Greek and Roman colonial culture, the strength of the Hanseatic League in the Middle Ages, or the scientific organization of modern European autonomous colonial cooperation. They only trace back to a method of heteronymous combination of ethnic groups as a symbol of collective life for outward development. It is also pitiful.</p>

<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Andre Derain (1)</p>
<p>Two days after returning to Paris from Switzerland, Zhang Xian and Wu Hengqin brought me four or five newspapers. When I opened them, they all reported on the exhibition of masterpieces by Renoir, Cézanne, Matisse, Derain, and Modigliani at the BEUJEUIMJEIUNE Gallery at 83 RUE DU FAUBOURG. To be honest, these names were not new to me. I had seen their works in Japan before, but they were not their best works. However, I had long sympathized with Renoir's trembling flesh, Cézanne's color scales, and Matisse's savage decorative tastes.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, we took a motorcycle from HOTEL DES FACULTES to the BEUJEUJMUENE Gallery at 83 RUE DES FAUBOURG. These galleries are not art museums, but art dealers' shops. This number 83 is the largest and most famous art shop in Paris. The owner, BEUJENUIJMEUNE, used to specialize in collecting works by Impressionist masters before they became famous. Later, he made a fortune. Even now, his collection is considered the richest. So, I often go there to see paintings. There were many people inside that day. I walked in and saw Renoir's nude paintings hanging on the left wall of the first room in the center. There were twelve small ones. Next to them were his still life paintings. Further in, a Cézanne "Bathers" was hanging in the middle of the opposite wall, flanked by two "Still Lifes" and "Portrait of Madame Cézanne". I had seen these masterpieces in photographs and bought colored prints. I never thought that the originals would be here. It really aroused my interest. I stood there and looked at them for a long time. I felt that the tight effect of the colors interacting with each other was very different from the prints. The charm of the original was even more unexpected. Further on were eight figures and still life paintings by Matisse. The beautiful and bright colors were as stimulating as seeing the bright scenery in Southeast Asia. He was truly able to obtain the decorative function of color. On the right wall were Derain's works. In this room, he had fourteen large works. In the middle hung a figure painting as large as a one hundred. It was his most famous masterpiece, "The Singer" ARLEQUIN ET PIERROT. To the left was a large painting "Reclining Nude". To the right was his "Greek Woman" FEMME GRECQUE painted in 1919. The remaining two landscapes, one "Flower", and six "Portraits". This is really the most noteworthy of many famous paintings. After seeing them, I gradually walked further inside. In the middle was another large "Still Life" by Derain, depicting many kitchen utensils. Next to it was a large loaf of bread. There were many sketches of him on both sides of the painting. Next to it was Matisse's painting. The paintings of these masters were displayed competitively relative to each other. Presumably, because they all had a common painting style and were also giants of special creation, putting them together could make people recognize several ancestors of the new era. Among them, Matisse and Derain, who are still alive, especially hold the hegemony of the modern European art system. There are so many famous paintings here, but the most eye-catching are still several of Derain's largest paintings. His color scheme is very strong. He draws on Courbet's solidity, Cézanne's sublimity, the black man's simplicity, and the Gothic's melancholy. He has no preconceived plan for painting. What he painted yesterday, he may discard today. Or, if he is interested, he may continue tomorrow. He loves simplicity. He loves things that are innocent. He loves to use black. Even when he uses green, it is very dark. As for the blue, it is often as deep as steel. His white is as white as snow, and he uses a few specks of soot. He uses ochre to depict sensuality. The ups and downs of his paintings are powerful and melodic. When he paints still life, there is no pretense. They are all simple or broken things used in daily life. A wine glass without a foot, or a rice bowl, a string of leftover grapes, a tattered tablecloth are often seen on his paintings. He wants to evoke an emotion from things that have been peeled off. This giant is alive now and cherishes his life very much. He must not be bound by anyone, nor is he enslaved by matter. He uses his independent life to directly express the visual of phenomena. He is the only modern artist who can continue the artistic style of the Middle Ages. At the same time, he is full of the spirit of the living modern.</p>

<h3 id="e245">Clara Bow <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Zhi</p>
<p>It was a rainy dusk in early spring. The low, drawn-out sound of the Guangdong bun seller in the alley was already harmonizing with the fine, insistent rain to create an "alley symphony." Such irritating weather was simply stifling.</p>
<p>Upstairs in the front building, three young men were engaged in a heated debate with a friend from Jiangwan. M was buried in writing something, interjecting with occasional jokes. L, his face flushed and veins bulging, was waving his fists, arguing loudly and excitedly with S from Jiangwan. C, who had originally sparked the debate, was siding with L's opponent, often supplementing S's arguments. They all seemed to have lost themselves in the discussion.</p>
<p>"No matter how you look at it, Clara Bow represents the decadence of the capitalist era. She has physical beauty, intoxicating eyes, and passionate kisses. She is the sole representative of American civilization today!" S said.</p>
<p>"If Clara Bow can represent modern American civilization, then the evils of capitalism have only produced one Clara Bow, which has nothing to do with anti-capitalism. But why is the world panicking about capitalism? Clara Bow is simply a manifestation of the evils of Hollywood under the control of capital," L retorted.</p>
<p>C, after a short "break," could no longer restrain himself and burst out like an erupting Mount Fuji, "I welcome capitalism! Because the power of capitalism is irresistible. The rapid rotation of machines and the drastic changes in human culture are all results of capitalism. For example, hasn't the JAZZ of New York influenced Shanghai? If there are still people who oppose machines and the JAZZ of the metropolis, they should just follow Yesenin (a Russian poet who committed suicide) and become ghosts!"</p>
<p>M, who had been holding a pen, spoke for the fourth time, "I don't oppose capitalism, and I don't oppose JAZZ, but I oppose Clara Bow. She is not as great as S and C claim. She has physical beauty, can KISS, is boisterous—but can these really represent American civilization? It's still questionable. For example, what has Clara Bow shown in the recently performed TALKYIDANGERARURNURVE? She was more sensual in REDHAIR. At most, she can represent the American woman shaped by capitalism today."</p>
<p>"No, we know that the representatives of the two major trends in modern civilization are Russia and America, and these two civilizations are impacting the entire world. No one can resist. And Clara Bow is precisely the capitalist type of woman. She is undoubtedly the embodiment of American civilization, and Clara Bow exposes everything on her person," C said.</p>
<p>"But, although Clara Bow can represent a part of American women, she is not as great as you admire. She is a natural phenomenon, and your kind of blind faith is inappropriate," L said.</p>
<p>S said, "No, an actor who can use her talent to portray a social model on the stage or screen is certainly great!"</p>
<p>"Of course, an actor with skill who can portray a certain type of society can be considered successful, but she is not great. Because artistic success and greatness are not the power of one person alone, especially in theater and film, which are multifaceted syntheses. If Clara Bow is good at performing, she is merely a worker in an art production workshop. What's the point of worshiping blindly? Besides, whether she is successful is still subject to our careful criticism," M said.</p>
<p>"Heat!" S replied loudly.</p>
<p>"Yes," C interjected, "Heat, heat is the source of modern culture! All machines, JAZZ, must be hot! Heat is what we should worship! Those who don't understand Clara Bow don't deserve to be modern youths!" C was truly agitated.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay!" S clapped his hands and shouted. L was furious. "No talking about Clara Bow! Those who want to talk can get out!"</p>
<p>"We insist on talking! We insist on talking!" S and C said in unison.</p>
<p>"Get out!" L was really angry now.</p>
<p>"Hey, hey, hey!" M threw down his pen and stood up, gesturing with both hands, "Let's stop talking, gentlemen. Don't you feel hungry?"</p>
<p>"Don't talk!" L added again.</p>
<p>"That's right, you're debating Clara Bow here. What if Clara Bow knew?" M said to S and C, "She would give each of you a loud KISS, like in (Curved Love)!" M then turned to L, "At the same time, if Clara Bow came and kissed you in front of you, you wouldn't object, would you?"</p>
<p>Everyone laughed unnaturally.</p>
<p>Outside, the rain was still falling. The delivery man happily brought up a large pot of food. S grabbed an umbrella and ran downstairs. C chased after him, saying as he walked, "Going back to Jiangwan!"</p>
<p>During the meal, only the sounds of bowls and chopsticks could be heard. Clara Bow had been swallowed into their bellies.</p>

<p>▲ Durant 1930 Model Durant New Car. There are two types of new six-cylinder cars. The most notable aspect of the large six-cylinder car in terms of construction is the adoption of four-speed acceleration, with the gears completely silent when using the third gear. It is equipped with a 3-something x 4-something L-HEAD engine with 70 horsepower. The small six-cylinder also uses the same engine, but slightly smaller than the former, approximately 34-1 x 4-something, with 58 horsepower. The bodies of both of the above-mentioned new cars are newly manufactured, with a beautiful and charming style. According to the company, the new body is not only beautiful, but also longer than the old style.</p>
<p>Erskine 1930 Model Erskine New Car. This is a product of the Studebaker factory. The construction completely adopts a new method. According to the factory, the weight of the new car itself has considerable strength per pound, and is given a special name: Dynamic New Erskine. It also uses a six-cylinder L-HEAD engine with 70 horsepower. The engine's bore and stroke are 34-3 x 43-1 inches. The wheelbase is 114 inches. The body has also been reformed and is pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>Essex The new Essex car has a powerful six-cylinder engine. Although there is no reform in terms of length, the internal structure is completely different from the old car. The wheelbase has been increased to 113 inches, 2 and 1/2 inches longer than the old car. The body and interior have novel styles, all with special advantages. The roof, heat reduction device, and ladder for entering the car are all newly reformed and very satisfactory.</p>
<p>Graham Paige The 1930 model new cars produced by Graham-Paige Company have slightly changed in name compared to the old models. Among them, the passenger car named Graham is the company's latest product. The new cars include one type of eight-cylinder car, with a starting horsepower of only 10, and a wheelbase of 122 inches. It is also divided into two types: one with three-speed acceleration and one with four-speed. The third gear is completely silent during acceleration. The body structure and style are similar to the old cars, but the latter's equipment is more complete. As for the new six-cylinder cars with three-speed and four-speed acceleration and a wheelbase of 115 inches long, the construction method is completely the same. Other Graham new cars also have two types of four-speed acceleration, with wheelbase lengths of 127 inches and 137 inches respectively. The style of the body is completely new, and the color of the roof, heat reduction device, and ladder is particularly beautiful and spectacular.</p>
<p>Hudson Hudson has a large eight-cylinder new car on display at the exhibition. This new car is better than the factory's large six-cylinder car. The Hudson engine is also an L-HEAD type, with a bore and stroke of 2/43 x 4/21 inches. The horsepower is 80. The wheelbase is divided into two types: one is 115 inches and the other is 126 inches. The body structure completely adopts a new style, beautiful and dazzling, unprecedented. The most satisfying car equipment is the Day Light sedan installed on both Hudson and Essex cars. It can accommodate five people, and the price is extremely low. There are two doors, both equipped with hinged doors. The top can be folded up, completely concealing the glass, transforming it into a factory car.</p>
<p>Hupmobile Hupmobile has a large eight-cylinder new car, which was recently manufactured, with 133 horsepower. In terms of speed, it can travel 90 miles per hour. The engine is an L-HEAD type, with a bore of 3 and 1/2 inches and a stroke of 3 and 3/4 inches. The engine's carburetion system also uses a down-draft type and has a cold water device to monitor overheating. Therefore, even when using the strongest speed, the engine will not experience any accidents, preventing damage to the vehicle and increasing its lifespan. In addition, Hupmobile's new car exhibition also features an eight-cylinder car with 100 horsepower and a six-cylinder car with 70 horsepower, both of which are excellent products.</p>
<p>Lincoln Except for some unimportant parts that have been slightly reformed, the rest of the new Lincoln car is the same as the old car. However, Lincoln's body, with its sophisticated construction and beautiful style, has long been praised by the public. The body of this new car still does not lose its inherent position.</p>
<p>Marmon Marmon has two types of straight-eight-cylinder new cars on display at the exhibition, namely the 869 and 879 models.</p>
<p>The former is priced at US$1,500 and the latter at US$2,000. When these eight-cylinder cars were first manufactured, they were originally priced around US$3,000, while the Roosevelt brand was priced at US$1,000. The interiors of the 869 and 879 new cars are extremely spacious, the power is extremely strong, beyond the reach of existing cars, and the engine's construction is also excellent, equipped with an LBEAD combustion chamber. According to the factory, this combustion chamber can greatly increase the speed of the car.</p>
<p>Marquette MARQUETTE is a newly produced brand. Although it was publicly exhibited once in June of last year, it is a new addition to this International Automobile Exhibition. The car is produced by the Buick factory and is priced at approximately US$1,000. It uses an LBEAD engine with a bore of 3/81 x 4/85 inches, and a horsepower of 67.5. The wheelbase is 110 inches. The internal braking system is also automatic.</p>
<p>Nash Three types of new Nash cars are on display at the exhibition. They are all new cars that were exhibited once in mid-October of last year. Among them, there is one type of eight-cylinder car, using a dual-material power generation system, which is used to replace the old six-cylinder car. The dual-material power generation system of the six-cylinder new car replaces the old special six-cylinder car, while the ordinary six-cylinder new car replaces the standard six-cylinder old car. The car tops and windows of all new cars are larger than the old cars. The eight-cylinder new cars are all equipped with shatterproof glass, using pop-up pistons, and the engine is 3/41 x 4/21 inches. The horsepower is approximately 100. The wheelbase is divided into two types: one is 118 inches long and the other is 128 and 1/4 inches long. Due to the enlargement of the engine, the power has increased significantly compared to the 1929 model new car. The engine of the ordinary six-cylinder new car has also been slightly enlarged. All new cars are also equipped with automatic brakes.</p>

<p>Twenty-Four Cylinder Car Ding Zuce</p>
<p>Kay Don, a famous British racing driver, is specially manufacturing a great car named Silver Bullet in order to win the 1930 world speed record. This competition is imminent and will still be held at the Daytona Beach racetrack in Florida, USA.</p>
<p>The Silver Bullet racing car is long and narrow like a whale. The state is shown in the attached picture. In the picture, half of the outer shell has been removed, and the internal machinery is completely exposed. A is the ice-cooled radiator, B and C are two continuous engines, each with twelve cylinders, manufactured by the British Sunbeam Motor Car Company. D is the supercharger, E is the carburetor, E is the steering gear, G is the exhaust pipe, H is the rudder tail, J is the water pump, K is the connecting crankshaft, L is the intake pipe, M is the clutch, M is the drive shaft, and is the gearbox.</p>
<p>The car is 30 feet long and 44 inches wide. The length seems amazing, but because its width and height are very small, at first glance almost no one knows the greatness of its internal mechanical power.</p>
<p>Both the front and rear axles are suspended under semi-elliptical springs. Although the form of the springs is similar to that of ordinary cars, the steel sheets are unusually wide and the distance between the upper and lower springs is only one inch at most. This is because it is intended to prevent the wheels from being skewed during high-speed driving.</p>
<p>The engine is two twelve-cylinder engines connected in a straight line. Each engine has six cylinders on each side, forming a V shape. Each cylinder has four valves, located in four corners on the cylinder head. There are two exhaust valves and two intake valves. In the center of the four valves is the spark plug. The eccentric camshaft that opens and closes the valves is located on the top of the cylinder and transmits power from the front end of the engine to operate it. Each bearing on the crankshaft uses steel column bearings, so it can rotate up to 4,000 revolutions per minute. Each engine weighs about 1,000 pounds and can generate 2,000 horsepower. It is estimated that each half pound of the machine body generates one horsepower, which is the greatest new contribution to the engineering world.</p>
<p>Nowadays, high-speed engines all use superchargers to</p>
<p>increase their horsepower. The Silver Bullet is no exception, and the supercharger installed is quite large. It is a large-diameter centrifugal type that draws in oil and gas from two carburetors and blows it into the cylinders at high pressure. Although the two engines are connected as one, their crankshafts are not directly connected in a straight line. Instead, another shaft is set up under these two crankshafts, using gears to transmit power to the lower shaft. The speed of the lower shaft is twice as fast as the crankshaft. It is said that this structure can avoid the torsional force directly applied to the crankshaft when entering.</p>
<p>The Silver Bullet car is prepared to travel at a high speed of 200 to 300 miles per hour. At such a high speed, its brakes must be very safe to avoid danger. Therefore, the construction of the brakes is extremely novel. Each brake wheel is made by cutting a steel block weighing about 400</p>
<p>pounds into a copper bowl weighing 45 pounds. This alone shows the prudence in its manufacture. The application of the brakes is driven by liquid pressure, and to prevent it from generating high heat, a water cooling device is installed.</p>
<p>In order to avoid wind resistance, the shape of the car body uses a streamline everywhere. Not only that, the bottom of the car body is completely sealed, covering all the internal mechanical parts. This is in case it rushes into the sea (note that the American racing driver Lockhart was once swept into the sea by waves last year, and then hit back to the beach by the waves, so it can still be used to float). In front of the driver's seat, a thick nickel-steel screen is used to prevent the engine from catching fire and to prevent the driver from being crushed in the event of a collision.</p>
<p>The structure of all parts of the car can be said to encompass everything that humans can think of, such as the use of the tail rudder to prevent the forward skew, and the position of the fuel tank behind the driver's seat, making it completely avoid the heat of the engine compartment. It is impossible to list them all.</p>
<p>According to the world record of car speed, it has been increasing year by year. In the most recent three years, the winners of the championship have all been British. In 1928, it was created by Campbell of England. Its speed was 214.797 miles. The racing car was named Bluebird, with 1,000 horsepower. In 1929, it belonged to Segrave of England. The speed reached 231.36 miles. The racing car was named Golden Arrow, also with 1,000 horsepower.

<p>The world's people's choice of cars often depends on women. This is not because men deliberately take women's likes and dislikes as their own. It is because women's aesthetic concepts are often more meticulous and profound than men's. Their insights are very advanced, and their choices are always appropriate. Car manufacturers are well aware that the power of women is enough to influence their sales. Therefore, in all aspects related to the color, painting, and decoration of vehicles, they are competing to hire female artists to take charge. When considering car manufacturers that are famous in the world for hiring female artists, Studebaker is undoubtedly the leading example. The factory's engineering consulting division recently established a Fashion Committee. The committee consists of six members, all of whom are women. Their sole mission is to research and discuss how to make the factory's products consistently artistic and fashionable. According to the opinions on art expressed by these individuals, they possess profound principles and insightful views. People are invariably impressed by their theories and regard them as a model to follow, like a compass.</p>
<p>Who are these six women? They are Ms. Helen, Mrs. Lee Shempson, Ms. Marjorie, Ms. Nasha, Ms. Horner, and Ms. Molly Hong. These individuals all possess exceptional talent and extensive experience in the coordination of car colors, the planning of lines and patterns, the structure of the car body, and the design of planes and curves. They are undoubtedly recognized as famous artists worldwide. Here is a brief introduction to each individual, which readers may find interesting.</p>
<p>Ms. Shaolun is the highest-paid female artist in America. Ms. Shaolun first created the cover of the art magazine "Vee Zhi," which was highly regarded in the art world and praised by society. Everyone said that Ms. Shaolun is a pioneer in the modern art world. Ms. Shaolun also excels in stage costume design and interior decoration, all of which are extremely beautiful. She is truly an outstanding woman and a rare talent in the art world. Mrs. Lee Shempson is a famous artist and decorator. Her husband is the director of a famous theater in New York. His artistic talent and experience are deeply trusted by the audience, while Ms. Xue possesses a keen intellect and unique insight in the field of art. Her suggestions or criticisms are always pertinent and enhance the work considerably. It is said that her husband's success in his career is largely due to his virtuous wife.</p>
<p>Ms. Marjorie is the female owner of a fashionable shop on Madison Avenue in New York. She is skilled at managing and operating her business, so since its opening, her business has been booming. Ms. Marjorie has also become famous in the business world and enjoys a good reputation. Ms. Marjorie is also skilled in painting and excels in pattern making. The sophistication of her works is deeply admired by the people. Because she is at the forefront of fashion and was the first to advocate for women's employment, and also because she leads by example and works diligently, women especially admire and praise her endlessly.</p>
<p>Delicious, and the cover pictures are even more profound in meaning and noble in style, and can indeed attract people. It is not only exquisite and beautiful. According to the cover pictures of these magazines, most of them are from the pen of Ms. Nasha, all of which are extremely valuable and worthy of treasure. In addition, Ms. Horner is an artist and writer, and Ms. Molly Hong is the commercial editor of a number of magazines. She is now a consultant in the style departments of major companies. People in Europe and the United States agree that the opinions or proposals made by ladies on styles are the most valuable and worthy of consideration.</p>

<p>those who set an example.</p>
<p>Studebaker Factory does not hesitate to spend a lot of money to hire the above people to plan everything on their behalf. No wonder their products are popular with people in society and especially welcomed by women, and their sales have also increased sharply. Mr. Oscon, the general manager of the factory, expressed his special attention in his recent</p>
<p>Published remarks, the important relationship between vehicle equipment and its beautiful color separation. This is also based on his own insights. It is not a theory based on nothing. He said. Tracing back to Da</p>
<p>Since the war, the social life of the American people has obviously made pleasant and far-reaching progress. However, the most gratifying and most effective of these advances in the long run is the unanimous and enthusiastic need for artistic industrial products. By the so-called artistic, That is, the quality or appearance of everything, to refresh our eyes and ears, and please our body and mind. In the past, this need was limited to exquisite and delicate products. Now, everything is durable and unchanging in practical articles, and also fully improved, and strives to be beautiful, in order to meet the needs of our people. Take the new Studebaker car, for example. The installation of the car equipment and the matching of colors are specially presided over by the above-mentioned major art experts. After several studies and several improvements, every detail of the car can be beautified one by one. The reason why Studebaker cars are perfect and without any flaws is that they can indeed meet the ardent needs of our people and occupy the leading position in the automotive industry.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Scientific Perspective on Automobile Business by Cheng Zhizheng <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>Failures Can Be Easily Improved After Analyzing Twelve Points</p>
<p>Modern times are a scientific world. Everything, everything, tends to be scientific, and doing business is also aimed at scientific methods. The so-called scientific method has a very broad meaning, but to summarize and generalize it, the scientific method is to do things in an orderly manner and to be able to analyze. In business, analysis is especially important. In meritorious times, we must study how to succeed, and in times of failure, we must study how to fail. Find the cause of the failure, and then study it and improve it. The business will naturally flourish. But to say that the automobile business occupies a great and superior position in modern industry and commerce, its management and management must be able to use scientific methods. Recently, the Automotive Weekly published twelve reasons for the failure of the automobile business, and the analysis is extremely clear, which can help the general automobile business. Therefore, I translated this article.</p>
<p>(1) The business work does not work hard to observe the problem of employment using scientific methods. The first is to study efficiency. Therefore, the efficiency of working for one minute is greater than the value of working for a quarter of an hour without efficiency. If the automobile company does not pay attention to this level and does not find ways to improve efficiency, failure is undoubtedly. Therefore, whenever it is seen that the staff is not working hard, methods should be taken to improve it. The improvement methods are also very resolute, such as bonus fees, stock sharing system, etc. How to use it will not be discussed in this article for the time being.</p>
<p>(2) The machine is not good Some automobile companies buy old machines for cheap. As a result, the quality of the goods produced is too poor, and the service performance is too poor. The business will inevitably gradually dim down. Some companies buy new machines, but they are not good at choosing, or they only choose cheap ones, so the same result will occur.</p>
<p>(3) Intellectual advertising In the automobile business, what cannot be saved the most is an advertising fee. However, the same advertisement is published, and the effect received by Company A and Company B is different. Maybe Company A spent more money, but the effect is not as good as Company B. Therefore, advertisements cannot be published casually. We must study which newspapers and magazines have the largest sales volume and which advertisements are the most eye-catching and can get the greatest effect, but cost the most economical money. This point seems very small, but the key to the success or failure of the company is completely tied to it. The losses of many companies are the result of poor advertising.</p>
<p>(4) Not good at selecting business during operation There are many automobile service companies in various parts of the United States. The businesses they operate are naturally different. Or washing cars or lubricating cars. Before opening, they should choose the specialties. Do not choose more poor people, because if there is too much work, the clues will be complicated. The work is not specialized, and the command is difficult to be satisfactory. The efficiency is extremely low. Therefore, the selection of business must be extremely careful.</p>
<p>(5) Insufficient or too much capital Capital depends on the scope of business. If the scope is wide, if the capital is less, it will not be able to turn around. If the scope is small, if the capital is large, it will only lose money. Those who are good at business are most sensitive to this. When to increase capital and when to reduce it can all meet its needs without wasting it. Moreover, it is necessary to plan for the financial market in advance, so as not to dig wells when thirsty, and capital has to borrow with huge interest. This kind of early understanding is of course in everyone's mind. </p>
<p>(6) Making unnecessary competition Unnecessary competition is also the main cause of failure. The so-called "cut-throat competition" (CNTTBROATCOWPETITION) is both harmful and unprofitable, and must not exist. Even if there are many peers in one place, the prices should be unified and agreed upon. This is the right way. Moreover, it is not necessarily welcome for customers to win customers' hearts with low prices, because they only hope for good service. The price is higher, as long as the service is good, they do not ask. On the contrary, if the price is too low, they will definitely suspect the poor service and the goods are not refined.</p>
<p>(7) No credit standards It is very common to do business and pay on account, but we must also pay attention to the credit standard of this person. If he has no credit, and you put out a huge amount of money, the result will be that the money cannot be recovered, and your own capital will be greatly affected. Making a cocoon and binding yourself will burn you to death. Why bother?</p>
<p>(8) Too much small business What is small business? That is, most of the customers are small businesses, but there are very few big businesses. As a result, the procedures are more and the labor costs increase. The rewards obtained cannot be calculated. Therefore, when the company is recruiting, it should pay attention to big customers. It is worth having one more big customer and ten fewer small customers.</p>
<p>(9) The efficiency of canvassers It is undoubtedly necessary to pay attention to the efficiency of the staff. We have already described it in detail above. However, the personnel who go out to solicit business must also be given the same attention. However, internal personnel can be audited every day, while external personnel are not easy to deal with, because the whip is beyond reach and there is no way to check. However, we can estimate the efficiency of each person based on the achievements of each person, and decide to stay or leave. If the people you use are very efficient, then naturally. Why is the company's business so good?</p>
<p>(10) No business plan Business plan. Naturally, it is difficult to make money. For example, for Gu. If it is a car dealer, then. Test drive, contact, all kinds of procedures, there must be a predetermined plan. If it is a service company, then the customer must be reminded at that time for the purpose of repairing, refueling, etc., so as not to have their own business taken away by others. If the internal plan is set, everything can be carried out very smoothly.</p>
<p>(11) There are too many redundant staff The capital must be proportional to the size of the business scope. It has been mentioned slightly above. The problem of employment is also the same. If the affairs are cloudy, and many personnel are employed, it will certainly fail. Ordinary companies also like to arrange private individuals in the official office, so that efficiency cannot be obtained. Unnecessary consumption is enough to shorten the life of the company.</p>
<p>(12) Not researching why customers do not come Customers are the nurturers of the company's life. Their position should be highly valued in the company's eyes. In the eyes of shrewd operators, it is necessary to record the names and addresses of customers in detail, on the one hand to increase new customers, and on the other hand to maintain old customers. Once old customers do not come, they must immediately study the reasons for not coming in order to remedy them. If the company does not pay attention to these important events, how can it fail?</p>
<p>The reasons and remedies for business failure have been analyzed in great detail. At the moment when companies are preparing to expand their business in the New Year, I dare to offer these points with sincerity. Maybe it can help the business more or less.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Road Maintenance by Tan Wufei <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>The establishment of roads is originally intended to benefit transportation and facilitate merchants and travelers. Therefore, when it was first built, it was not unflat. However, after a long period of neglect, from light to heavy, the potholes became uneven. When the</p>
<p>At the beginning of the car's passage, it was not unstable. However, after a long period of traffic, from high to low, turning was uncomfortable. At this time, if we talk about maintenance, the cost will be huge and uneconomical. It is best to prevent the road construction team from organizing and dividing into two groups: road repair and road maintenance. If the road team manages several miles of road sections with a small number of workers, they should be on duty in sections and inspect them. If traces are found on the road surface, or if there is damage, fill it immediately to restore it to its original state. Until the road surface material can no longer be maintained, the road repair team will add materials and re-repair it to make it a complete road, and then carry out the road maintenance method. That's about it. In recent years, the construction of highways is too expensive to pour asphalt, and generally broken stone roads and sand and soil roads are the most common. Therefore, the maintenance methods are also different. According to the observations of the general public, the reasons for road damage can be summarized into two main points. One is weather damage, such as wind, rain, ice and frost, etc. One is mechanical damage, such as wheel rolling and hoof trampling. The speaker also said that 20% of the damage is caused by the weather, and 80% is caused by the machine wheels. This is only for the road surface. I said that or the declaration of war is poor, the roadbed is wet, or the roadbed is soft and sunken due to saturated moisture.</p>
<h2>Page 29</h2>
<p>That is also a major cause of damage to the public bombing. The maintenance method should adopt the patrol worker system. Patrol workers are long-term workers hired to specialize in road maintenance. They should be assigned to a designated road section, which is several miles long. There are several workers, led by the foreman. Inspect the road section under their jurisdiction every day. If there is any damage, level it according to the law immediately. Workers should patrol the road surface at least two people every day. This method is practiced in various countries and has achieved satisfactory results. Now, the maintenance methods for broken stone roads and sand and soil roads are described separately.</p>
<p>There are about eighteen items in the maintenance method of broken stone roads (1)</p>
<p>If the road surface is uneven, or there are ruts, and there is water storage, repair it with crushed stone to restore it to its original state. (2) The middle part of the road should always be higher than both sides, forming a shallow parabolic shape. (3) For roads with minor damage, dig up and repair them without adding crushed stone. (5) The excavated part of the road surface should be round and not be sharp-angled square corners. (5) The depth of excavation shall not be less than the maximum diameter of the stone block. (6) For roads with full excavation and repair, the middle part should be excavated first, and then both sides after repair. (7) Stone blocks shall not be discarded on the road surface. (8) Crushed stones that cannot pass through a one-and-a-half-inch sieve hole shall not be used. (9) The weight of each piece of crushed stone shall not exceed five taels. (10) Organic matter should be removed from the stone powder used as adhesive material. (11) The road surface should be watered frequently. (12) Rubbish, dregs, weeds and branches in ditches and culverts and under bridges should be cleaned frequently. (13) If there are small trees and deep grass at the road ends of culverts and bridges that hinder pedestrians and drivers' vision, they should be removed immediately. (14) Ditches with water accumulation should be dredged immediately. (15) Bridges, culverts, mileage signs, warning signs, highway huts, etc., should be repaired immediately if they are damaged. (16) Implement the collection of registration according to the rules for banning heavy vehicles. (17) Bridge wood beside the road.</p>
<p>There are about fourteen items in the maintenance method of sand and soil roads. (1) Road</p>
<p>Where the surface is uneven or ruts appear, use sand and soil to fill it up and compact it firmly to restore it to its original state. (2) The middle part of the road should always be higher than both sides, forming a parabolic green shape. (3) Stone blocks shall not be discarded on the road surface. (4) If the road letter softens after rain and becomes sticky, and mud adheres to the wheels, it is evidence of less sand. Use a pusher to level it immediately and spread a layer of sand. (5) If the road surface is dry on a sunny day and there is looseness, it is evidence of too much sand. Wait until after the rain, use a pusher to level it and spread a layer of soil. (6) When using a pusher, it must form a 45-degree angle with the center line of the road and scrape from the side of the road to the middle of the road. (7) The road surface should be watered. (8) The composition of the sand and soil used for patching the road should be the same as or made the same as the composition of the original road. (9) If there are rubbish, dregs, tree branches and weeds in ditches and culverts and under bridges, they should be cleaned frequently. (10) If there are small trees and deep grass at both ends of culverts and bridges that can hinder pedestrians and drivers' vision, they should be removed immediately. (11) Ditches with accumulated water should be dredged immediately. (12) Bridges, culverts, mileage signs, warning signs, highway huts, etc., should be repaired immediately if they are damaged. (13) Implement the ban according to the rules for banning heavy vehicles. (14) Protect roadside trees.</p>
<p>The above two methods of highway maintenance have been discussed in detail by the Construction Department of the Hebei Provincial Government. Now, I have added my own opinions for the attention of those who build highways in various places, so that they know that highways are not difficult to build at the beginning, but difficult to maintain after they are built, so as to be long-term and economical.</p>

<h3 id="e254">The Myriad Aspects of American National Highways by Xu Meilie <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>The smooth or blocked traffic is related to the prosperity or decline of the country. Entering its territory, if the fields are cultivated and the roads are well managed, then it is known that the country is strong and rich, and the culture is flourishing. Conversely, the country is poor and the people are weak, which can be known without asking. The roads are to the country as the meridians are to the body. When the meridians are open, the body is strong, and when the road network is dense, the country is prosperous. Those who observe the country do not need to seek and study deeply, and they can get a general idea of it. The United States, as a rising country in the New World, has dominated the world and become the richest of nations in less than two hundred years. Tracing back to the reason, although there are various main reasons, the development of transportation and the full exploitation of resources have contributed to it. The American road system is divided into national highways, state highways, county roads, and village roads. As far as national highways are concerned, the statistics of the forty-eight states show that the road lines are about 189,000 miles long, and about 78,000 miles have been improved and completed. The longitude and latitude are endless, densely woven like a net, and the transportation is convenient, ranking first in the world. Each year, the</p>
<p>The state allocates 75 million yuan for the construction of national highways. Now, President Hoover, in view of the fact that the roads in various states are very developed, but there is still a need for improvement and expansion, the original funding is insufficient, and the road budget must be increased. He has specially negotiated with the state governments on the economic cooperation plan. According to the report of the National Highway Administration, the mileage of road construction last year was shorter than in previous years. If the funding is not increased, the progress of all construction plans will not be as rapid as in the past few years. The reason why it was able to proceed according to the predetermined steps was due to the fact that the road construction fees in the early years had not been fully used, and the accumulated surplus over the years was very large. With this huge amount of money, the leap forward in road administration in the past few years could be promoted. Now, the savings have been exhausted, and the cost of labor and materials has also increased. It is not enough to rely on the annual funding alone. Therefore, the result is limited and reduced. If we want to seek rapid progress in roads, it will not be successful without increasing funding. Therefore, the central government has a plan to jointly raise road funds with the states. Now, most of the administrative heads of the states have agreed to assist as much as possible. However, the greatest driving force for the development of roads still depends on the central government. Regarding the specific movement to increase road funding, members of Congress have proposed a bill to increase the national highway annual fee to 125 million yuan. If it is approved, the trend of road administration in the future will be advancing rapidly again. According to the budget of the American Automobile Association, the national road and street construction and maintenance costs in 1930 will exceed 250 million yuan, and the number of workers needed will reach 625,000. If so, there will be even more amazing achievements in the world. It can be asserted. The following is a list of the national highway statistics of the states compiled by the association, as of the autumn of 1929, to see the development of American road administration.</p>

<p>The Business Status of Chinese Public Buses by Lin Yingmei</p>
<p>The China General Omnibus Company held its annual shareholders' meeting on February 25th at the General Manager's office in the Sassoon House. The meeting was chaired by Chairman Arnold (HEArnhold), who reported on the company's business status over the past year. The following is a translation of Mr. Arnold's speech:</p>
<p>Before reviewing last year's accounts, I have a few points to report to you, which I believe you will be pleased to hear. The rapid development of the company's business in the past year has been unprecedented. Southbound vehicles have been continuously added, and there are now as many as ninety-eight vehicles. Huge expansion plans are still actively underway. Once new vehicles are added to the fleet, the rush hour congestion can be dealt with. Adding vehicles to facilitate passengers and eliminate crowding is the company's consistent policy. In addition, running double-decker buses is another way to reduce congestion. Three have now been ordered for trial runs. The traffic congestion is similar to that of major cities around the world, which is not surprising. Transportation agencies, regardless of whether they are buses or trams, on the ground or underground, always have extra vehicles and personnel available for the comfort of passengers, so that there is no concern about congestion during rush hours. In that case, the huge daily expenses must be met by increasing fares. The company's vehicle mileage has increased by 60% compared to the previous year, so it is necessary to add maintenance equipment to cope with this. The original vehicle depot has been expanded, and a new office has been built at 263 Connaught Road, as the old buildings were no longer sufficient due to business development.</p>
<p>The public bus business cannot meet the needs of society without annual promotion and expansion. The new vehicles arriving in Shanghai this year still require further construction of buildings for protection. The company pays great attention to the maintenance of vehicles, and all employees are able to work diligently. Therefore, the number of vehicle breakdowns is comparable to that of well-known British companies when calculated by average mileage driven.</p>
<p>Breakdown Incidents</p>
<p>Unexpected breakdowns are a daily danger and concern in the transportation business, and are practically unavoidable. The company pays special attention to this to minimize breakdowns. Fortunately, with the concerted efforts of senior staff, considerable progress has been made in the past year. Last year, there were a total of 4,926 breakdown incidents (4,227 in the previous year), but most of them were minor accidents. All incidents, regardless of size, are recorded. The drivers employed by the company are all experienced, and some have been employed for two years without causing any accidents. The company's reward and punishment system is strict: awards are given for merit, and training is intensified for mistakes to reduce accidents and improve efficiency.</p>
<p>Labor Status</p>
<p>The company has not experienced any labor disputes of any nature in the past year. This is particularly worth reporting. In addition, the Chinese employee pension fund mentioned in last year's report has now accumulated to more than 23,000 taels. The relationship between the company and its employees is satisfactory. The company considers or accepts employee opinions, regardless of their position. All employees are diligent and competent, and follow the instructions of the board of directors and the general manager to develop the company's business. The degree of success can be seen in last year's profit and loss statement.</p>
<p>Accounting</p>
<p>Various accounting reports have been sent to you for several days, so I will not repeat them. Last year's net profit was 101,634.43 taels, as shown in the table, which I believe you have already seen. Adding the 13,838.54 taels carried over from the previous year, the total is 115,472.97 taels for distribution.</p>
<p>The directors propose to pay a dividend of 9% on the capital of one million taels, which requires deducting 90,000 taels. It is also proposed to transfer the balance of 71,294.85 taels under the "share premium" item to the "credit" and "expansion" items. A further 7,505.15 taels will be extracted from the "profit and loss" item to offset the above two items. The remaining balance of 17,967.82 taels in net profit will be carried over to the new accounts. The company's capital has increased from 703,000 taels to one million taels. The remaining 29,700 shares were all sold at a face value of ten taels, with an additional premium of two taels and five mace per share. As a result, the "share premium" item increased to 71,294.85 taels.</p>
<p>The vehicle and tire depreciation fund has also increased, and there seems to be no shortage. However, since the original vehicles were purchased, the exchange rate has suddenly plummeted, so the depreciation amount in the accounts is less than the replacement cost. The other star debtor accounts have been completely settled. The number of invoices issued is slightly higher than last year.</p>
<p>Assets</p>
<p>On the asset side, the credit item increased by 25,800 taels, of which 22,000 taels was paid to the original concessionaire. According to the contract, the concessionaire could purchase 10,000 shares of the company's stock at face value free of charge. Therefore, it is better to pay a lump sum to exchange for this option. The other item of 3,000 taels is the payment for receiving the branch road. Since the road was taken over, the business has been quite prosperous. The expansion account has not changed. It is now proposed to offset it together with the credit account, as mentioned above. The land account has not changed. The building account increased by 94,185.08 taels. The reason has just been explained. The total value of vehicles is 916,913.44 taels, all calculated at the actual price. The depreciation fund against this is 246,372 taels. Inventory increased to 111,634.43 taels. The other star</p>

<p>All receipts, whose unpaid situations are not a cause for concern. The 147,058.89 taels owed by Arnhold &amp; Co. is the company's floating balance, which is kept by the company in its capacity as a bank. In the future, it can be deducted from dividends or instructed to purchase new vehicles on behalf of the company. At the same time, this amount receives good interest income.</p>

<p>Various business statistics are dry and boring, and it is not possible to describe them in detail at this time. It is better to mention a few points briefly, which are more concise and clear. I believe you will be pleased to hear them. Last year, the company's vehicles traveled 3.5 million miles, carrying more than 33 million passengers, consuming 750,000 gallons of gasoline, and the fare income included 2,550 tons of copper coins. The length of tickets sold totaled 1,000 miles. Looking at everything, this industry has a bright future.</p>

<p>Due to the muddy roads caused by the weather, the buses were suspended for nine days from the 7th. Normal service resumed on the 16th. News from the Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company: The Shanghai-Jiading bus route has been operating for several months since it opened. The number of passengers is high, and the business is very good. There are twelve round trips every day, all operating according to the published timetable. There have been no accidents involving missed or delayed departures. Travelers on the Shanghai-Jiading route generally praise this route. Due to excessive rainfall last winter and continuous spring rain in recent days for ten days without interruption, the newly built section of the road from Jiading to Luodian, which is fourteen Chinese miles long, has not been completed for long. The roadbed is not very firm, and has been repeatedly eroded by rainwater. The soil on the road surface has gradually become loose, and after being pressed by the heavy wheels of vehicles, it immediately presents an uneven surface with high and low points, and the soil is muddy and slippery, with accumulated water forming puddles, which is not good for travel. In order to avoid all dangers of overturning and injuring people, the company had no choice but to announce the suspension of service from the 7th. The weather has recently turned sunny and clear, and the soil is gradually drying. The road maintenance department is actively engaged in repairs, and the original condition can be restored soon. However, since the suspension of service has lasted for nearly ten days, the company felt that passengers would be inconvenienced if it was delayed further. Therefore, normal service resumed on the 16th.</p>
