<h3>非武力抵抗說</h3>
<p>非武力抵抗。實爲近世民族運動史中最文明之一辦法。亦即爲近世民族運動進步之一證。印度運動獨立。首創此一法。其領袖甘地。昨又發表一文。謂非武力抵抗之唯一危險。厥爲發生暴舉。如有暴舉。則今已知有處置方法。不再退縮。此非武力抵抗與拒絕暴舉。必繼續進行至代表無一生存而後已。又謂余愛非武力抵抗。勝過世間一切物。此種運動。而於愛印人。亦出於愛英人。余願自受痛苦。以求改變英人之心而不欲傷害之。質言之。欲始終以非武力抵抗求達目的。而不欲以非武力始卒以武力終。違反愛已愛人之初衷也。甘地此言。固由深痛印度經過迭次之犧牲慘劇。而亦鑒於凡運動獨立之各民族其始無一不欲避去武力。然運動一起。暴舉隨之。暴舉即爲招致武力之原。故甘地氏以此爲戒。而專欲以誠意動人也。</p>
<p>雖然。運動獨立。而欲始終保持非武力。其勢甚難。昨電載菲律濱獨立運動。開始抵制美國捲烟。是菲人亦欲以非武力抵抗美國也。然而因干涉吸烟。二十四小時内。被創三十人。已恐將引起暴舉矣。學生三千餘罷課。要求辭退美教員。亦不過表示非武力抵抗之意也。然而學生携旗游行。激烈者乘機鼓動。散播小册抨撃首領。則苟非當局處以鎭靜。亦將有發生暴舉之慮矣。故以非武力抵抗爲運動。而欲避免暴舉。勢實非易。甘地氏之用心雖良。處置方法雖有恐亦不易達其目的耳。</p>
<p>竊嘗謂世界之爭。無論何事。其初何嘗不欲以和平方法解决之。迨其後幾番曲折。幾番變化。不知不覺而變易初衷。終成非武力解决不可之勢。其例甚多此次之列强軍縮會議。實希望世界和平。欲以非武力解决國際爭端也。然而會議結果。果能成此大功耶。將來國際間一切爭端。果能盡以非武力解决之耶。此則無論何人。不敢斷言。則非武力抵抗之說難言矣國内電電三</p>

<h3>記關氏二小友</h3>
<p>— 無畏菴主</p>
<p>汪勁扶師日前自杭來滬。約往關芸農先生寄廬。視其二三兩公子德辛德尚。德辛年甫十三。德尚未满十齡。均勁師疇昔得意門弟子也。</p>
<p>旣抵關宅。德辛德尚出見。彬彬有禮。談吐風雅。眉宇間有英雋氣。勁師語愚。此誠濁世之佳公子。愚謂於以足徵其所沐家庭教育之美且善矣。</p>
<p>客室内上懸二小友合攝之玉照。旁即德辛所書之聯。秀逸遒勁。善用方筆。句爲菊放東籬晚。梅開北嶺寒。附有跋語。係八歲時所屬對者。勁師并令出近作相　。落落大方。遵各取原改本一册。每文雖寥寥數行。而言簡意賅。尺幅中猶有萬里之勢。所爲五言絕詩。饒有古風。爲文善用譬喻。多有作非非想之妙。高一涵先生。嘗爲嘆賞不已。是日。芸農適外出。越日再訪。語次。以菊放東籬晚一對。甫成下句。而許靜仁先生即來。大爲稱讚。爲書且能寫大幅壽序至千百字。始終一貫。德尚年較稚。書宗魯公。出臨池日課。頗有氣韻。昔孔文舉見太史慈。戲呼小友。愚亦竊願僭附。書生結習。終難恝然。抑何可哂耳。</p>
<h3>金湯團之怪聞</h3>
<p>— 竹虚</p>
<p>竹虚雖以虚字自署其號。從不信玄虚怪誕事。即有所聞。亦嗤之以鼻而已。廢曆所謂落燈節。自蘇州來滬。卸裝怱怱。往訪表妹陳心一於東有恒路。坐甫定。女僕獻茶。即嘖嘖道金湯團事。且指其少夫人而謂其功敗於垂成也。表妹亦口講指畫。又舉竹虚之姪黄理文爲證。謂其所親見。諦聽旣審。雖不能不斥其怪。亦不能竟指爲虚。姑錄之以徵海内外哲學科學兩家之研究。廢曆元旦。習俗相沿。必煑湯團以祀先享客。又必於除夜五鼓即從事於湯鑊。蓋祀神祀先皆在昧爽時也。表妹家未能免俗。仍踵往年故事。督率家人。敬謹預備。及除夕分歲後。紅燭燒三。春更報五。少夫人卓儷吾女士。方躑躅堂前。料量祀事中之杯箸。女僕胡氏遽前稱賀。女士以爲賀正。微笑答之。僕曰。少夫人大喜。金湯團满釜矣。女士故淮北人。淮北相傳元旦湯團變金事。聞之素稔。即驚喜。入廚下。揭釜蓋視。湯沸如海上濤頭。而湯團不浮於面。顆顆匀圓。悉沉釜底作金黄色。益顯釜中沸湯之清白。而胡氏已崩角在地。一轉眼間。女士忽以剷入釜一淘。胡氏大驚曰。敗矣。而湯團果浮飄如常。但色不白而黄耳。表妹心一聞訊踵至。亦廢然曰。命也。不可强也。於是仍以薦先。而分食之。時理文姪以居相近。來賀亦得嘗之。堅硬殊費咀嚼而中嵌之芝蔴頭沙心。悉成塵土。士氣息充口皆满。胡氏亦大悔。不早以法陳於少夫人也。據胡氏云。當於揭釜蓋時急以金首飾一件投釜中。掩蓋加火。更以絲織品蒙於釜蓋上勿使洩氣。約二小時。纍纍者皆成兼金矣。又云此法傳於淮安何家。何氏於清嘉慶時曾有是事。竹虚不敏。終視爲莫須有事。而言者皆非耳食。表妹且留得湯團一枚。出以相示。黄而堅。擲之有聲。且乾而不裂也。表妹丈諸木齋謂聞之長老。竃以土成。薪以木燃。釜以金製。又涵水而加火。五行備具。故以鎔冶而成黄金。語亦似有理似無理也。我則仍謂之爲怪聞云。</p>
<h3>雙生兒腹部相連考</h3>
<p>— 繡君</p>
<p>天廬君海外茶話之第三則。述東京市立病院産室。有一産婦一胎雙生。腹部相連。共有一胃。雙方共有三足。産後母因血虚去世。而雙生兒則健康逾恒云云。（見本月五日本談）始未嘗不讀而異之。旣而旁搜遐討。知史册曁志書所載。類此者不在尠數。則事雖異而仍不足爲異也。縷述如下。</p>
<p>晉書五行志云。愍帝建興四年。新蔡縣吏任僑妻産二女。腹與心相合。自胸以上臍以下各分。南齊書五行志云。武帝永明五年。吳興東遷民吳休之家。女人雙生二兒。胸以下臍以上合。唐書五行志云。高宗儀鳳三年。四月。涇州獻二小兒。連心異體。初鶉觚縣衛士胡萬年妻。吳氏生一男一女。其胸相連。餘各異體。乃析之。則皆死。又産復然。俱男也。遂育之。至是四歲。以獻於朝。山西通志云。萬曆三十八年夏。繁峙縣李宜臣妻牛氏産二女。頭面相連。手足各分。</p>
<p>夫任僑之二女。胸以上臍以下各分。是明明腹部相連也。吳休之家雙生兒。胸以下臍以上合。又明明腹部相連。涇州二小兒連心異體。亦明明腹部相連也。惟李宜臣妻産二女。頭面相連。爲稍異耳。然據二申野錄所載。謂一女一眼一耳四齒兩手兩足。一女一眼一耳四齒一手兩足。是二女共有三手。仁東京所産之雙兒共三足。可與相提並論。特三隻手之名。太不雅馴耳。七修類稿。載嘉靖間。南京神樂觀。再三脚貓一頭。極善捕鼠。而走不成步。今謂人作事不盡合法。而頗能模仿爲之者。曰三脚貓。實本於此。異日東京之雙生兒。未知奚若。然旣有三足。則凡事捷足先得。可豫料也。嘻。異根同體。謂之連理。異畝同頴。謂之嘉禾。草木之異。猶以爲端。今雙生兒腹部相連。將所謂二人同心。其利斷金者。是耶非耶。吾於是乎有感。</p>
<h3>嶺南菓話</h3>
<p>— 劉仲養</p>
<p>不侫嗜食水菓。幾有一日不可無此君之概。遜清末葉。隨侍家君宦遊嶺南。嶺南地近熱帶。多産佳菓。因是更得大快朶頣焉。</p>
<p>荔枝爲嶺南特産。味甘肉腴。别饒風味。昔楊玉環喜啖荔。吾謂若以水菓比美人。則荔枝固菓中之楊妃也。增城縣衙署内。有荔枝樹一株。樹幹修巨。枝葉婆娑。所結實每枚外殻咸有綠痕一線。鮮艶奪目。爲他處所無。相傳昔邑宰某。有女絕慧。甚愛此樹。日必於綠隂如羃之下。讀書刺繡。當倦繡停針。每戲嚼綠絨。吐向枝頭。厥後女殁。即瘞樹下。精魂所依。乃化爲此。粤人錫以佳名曰掛綠荔枝。此雖近神話。未可盡信。然其事絕韻清時宰時邑者。歲必以二十枚驛遞呈貢以爲常。對本省大吏同僚。亦有所餽。大概督撫四枚。餘兩枚而已。今歲序頻更。不知該樹猶在否也。</p>
<p>粤省賭風之盛。由來已久。其賭術尤有匪夷所思者。最奇者則以黄柑一枚。懸之空際。任人猜此柑内共有核若干。下注旣竟。乃當衆剖柑出核。計其數以决勝負。是以水菓爲賭具矣。</p>
<h3>常識拾零</h3>
<p>— 湯筆花</p>
<p>戴呢帽。乘電車。切忌坐在開着窗的地方。因爲恐怕抛頂宫。（就是搶呢帽）所以老老門檻寗立勿坐。</p>
<p>坐黄包車切勿讓他走小路。要防黄包車夫和歹人串通。實行剥猪　的工作。</p>
<p>向先施永安新新這幾家大商店裏買東西。遇着不便拿的貨色。儘可開明姓名住址交給職員。把物件送到家裏。貨到付欵。而且送到後不必給分文酒資。</p>
<p>别的事情要有面子。惟有看醫生切勿撑面子。最好一味說苦。那麽醫生處方用藥要便宜得多。</p>
<h3>紀笑匠之笑片</h3>
<p>— 宗弟</p>
<p>世所公認之國産笑匠徐卓呆君。原屬一體育家。好作詼諧小說。初常粉墨登場。又曾一度作影片公司老板。近嘗在教育局辦事。現任某會幹事員。此君職業若斯善遷。誠不愧爲今日之馬浪蕩矣。大中華唱片公司慕其名。特請其灌音。成唱片半打。前日在友人家春宴。友出話匣唱之。覺片片滑稽突梯。引人發噱。時圍坐者八九人。皆笑得合不攏嘴。如「看告示」「殺頭生意」「調查户口」尤屬想入非非之作。即顧名思義。已足令人展顔矣。聞徐若此次所出之片。脚本皆出已手。故絕不落人窼　。轉使人有陳腐雷同之嘆也。會看趣人趣片。其銷路暢旺。當不减「不知所云集」焉。</p>
<h3>歐游通訊（四二）</h3>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>蒲台爾之死　AntoineBourdelle</p>
<p>三·他的藝術（上）</p>
<p>昻杜安蒲台爾死了。一個永向着完美的道上前進的藝人死了。如盎格爾Ingres他是法國南方蒙都防Montanbon地方的人。生於一八六二年。也如盎格爾一樣活到六十九歲。最初在都魯士美術學校習壁畫和彫刻。繼於一八八０年進巴黎美術學校。從佛格琪以埃爲師。以後又受教於達魯與吕奪。最後終於投羅丹之門。極被愛護。在羅丹的工作室中。潛心研究者十有五年。</p>
<p>蒲台爾當新興藝術如萬花怒放的那時候。獨默默地直探其奥秘。羅丹把「力」與「大」兩者傳授給了他。當這位大師享盛名的的時候。他已完成了他的大師的期望。孕育了他的藝學和思想上的精義。</p>
<p>愈是羅丹底作品的個性强烈。生命永久。愈見得蒲台爾底作品的多方面的發展。愈顯得他們作品的矛盾與衝突。羅丹的作品是一整箇的心靈的莊麗瑰偉的表白。絕對地箇人的。蒲台爾的作品。却在永久的覺醒的惶恐中。個性是少得多了。然而他的更爲精細。更爲激動的心靈。使他更易感受外來的影響。他有幾種作品。雖然没有自損他底價值。但已足使我們回憶到彫刻史上兩箇最光榮的時期。就是上古與東方的兩大時期的作品。爲蒲台爾所不憚汲取其靈感的。在别一方面。他的作品又是印象派與建築派的橋樑。在他青春時代的作品「弓手」HernclesArcher藏於巴黎盧森堡美術館。是屬於印象主義的。是肌肉的力本主義。與阿拉伯風的氣韻趣味的産味。反之。其成熟時代的作品。尤其是LaViergeAlsace。那是已經超脫到建築化的彫刻的動人的境界了。</p>
<p>我們更逼近地去觀察他的藝術。可以看出羅丹是替他立了一箇基礎。擷其精華。吐其糟粕。他超脫到建築化</p>
<p>的傾向。正是避免印象派萎靡的病態。這是羅丹及其許多門人所共有的弱點。</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>紗市難期轉振</p>
<p>紗市依然不振、且多數心理看低、因底貨漸厚、銷路未暢、加之時局多事、業外者羣爭抛空、故目前被賣方壓迫極盛、紗市仍在變化不定中、惟某廠商買進之額安然不動、本月份之價廉於現紗、實銷如長此呆滯、前途尚難穩定耳、</p>
<p>標紗抛空續疲　人標前市開盤、因上日跌風大厲、引起獲利者之抵補而回堅、各月漲三四錢、二盤以花價不振、形勢又起恐慌、市價驟跌六七錢、三盤六十八號大批補空、收盤回漲六七錢、結果各月漲一·三錢、午後開盤突跌三四錢、二三盤賣户較缺、市氣稍定、各月回漲三·四·六錢、查賣户以六十六號爲最多、前後兩市約計三四千包、全日成交統計二萬二千八百包、兹將人標收盤價錄左、</p>

<p>現紗銷路仍澹　各帮買去八百八十包、同行中則進一千二百包、行情與上日相仿客帮中川帮進量爲最健、計二百三十五包、此外牛莊帮進二百十五包、蘆州一百九十包、江西三十五包、沙市二十五包、蕪湖二十五包、香港五十包、内地五十五包、雜帮五十包、</p>
<h3>棉市仍無起色</h3>
<p>棉市平靜、但形勢尚疲、良以海外棉市情形軟化、毫無重大變化、各廠抛定外棉不少、此時對於本棉實無辦理、故實際生意亦清、所以人心看低、但漢路市價、難以大鬆云、</p>
<p>漢標先跌後回　前市開盤平平、拍至遠月漸覺軟化、跌一錢二三盤紗市不佳、賣氣驟熾、各月又跌一二錢、收盤抵空者較衆、回漲五分、午後市况平定、漲五分至一錢、全日成交統計三萬八千八百担、兹將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<p>現需停頓　現棉生意寂寞、各廠均無辦意碼頭上來源未有、售開姚花二千包、價三十四兩、三新廠進、現貨送廠、</p>
<h3>海外紗花漲跌不一</h3>
<p>英印棉報跌　昨日美棉初因大衆抛賣而疲、後因空户抵補及西部買進而堅、計期貨漲一至六磅音、現貨不動、英棉期貨跌十四點、現貨跌十一點、埃及棉現貨不動、印棉因美棉跌小及塲中人心傾向賣出而疲、計平果爾跌五羅比、遠期跌四至五羅比、奥姆辣跌六羅比、遠期蹬六至七羅比、白羅溪跌六羅比、遠期跌七羅比、電錄左、（二十日電）</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>米市平疲</p>
<p>閘北　昨日各帮到船三十餘號、市銷殊呆、</p>
<p>北粳因貨户不肯修削、買户不動、故全日斛數减少、惟半儎船底等貨客欲速了結、不得不勒短半尺至一角、薄稻受主寥寥、羊杜秈脚地極穩、去路甚化、兼裏路存積不充、人心看堅、大盤因粳薄欠佳、故祇挺定、客埠秈來貨極稀、交通又不甚爽暢、是以零銷轉注洋米、價格無榮辱、白元買氣沉靜、趨勢又不振、行情勉守原盤、</p>
<p>滬南　河下來源轉旺、本街銷場略淡、常錫北粳見定、惟蘇同機粳貨稀仍堅、各檔去化似較前日爲遜、市盤亦乏上落、南帮薄早稻走銷滯而不振、雖有少數飯胃略進、然係零星、店胃則平淡也、羊杜秈客帮尚稱殷勤、而到貨不旺、價見緊切、變隂元本街揀高選擇、行懚平穩、</p>
<h3>温州帮採辦小絞米</h3>
<p>昨日洋米、祇有小絞應市、以到存兩充、迄居軟勢、昨忽有温州帮到市暢辦、市形立見活潑、今明倘有續辦、則行情亦可上展矣、統市售開小絞近萬包、價十三元半至十三元三角、除本街外盡係温州帮及台州等購去、期貨西貢較多、價亦獨占優勢云、</p>
<h3>粉市頻開頻落</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份以洋麥報價仍跌、（芝加哥約落四角左右、坎拿大落八角之譜因此近遠期人心、異常虚軟、頻開頻落、迨至下午開盤、各月份之跌風較上午爲更甚、大廠抛貨雖屬無幾、而小廠出檔頗湧、且一般投機多頭、到此亦俱爲軟化、回出者亦極暢盛、查自去冬以來、市面之步昻、雖半屬麥底空虚所致、但半則爲人心所撑住、此種流動性之觀察、所謂看漲則大家爭買、看跌則大家回出、事到其間、不能全憑事實爲相衡也、依照此種狀態而言、終須跌出實銷胃口、或有轉定之望、如雙方各以憑空之推想、則空方未免稍占優勢也、結果本月份較前日收盤、又跌去二分七釐半之巨、三月份跌三分、四月份跌一分七釐半、五月份跌二分二釐半、六七月份各跌一分二釐半云、</p>
<h3>期麥一致銳跌</h3>
<p>現貨减抵二錢之巨</p>
<p>昨日期麥上下午開盤後、各月份一致在銳落之中、以洋麥報價續小、人心不振、而現麥日來到貨步暢、眞所謂貨高走遠客、不患不充盈也、更以粉市一週以來、連朝暴落、或跌一錢、或跌一錢外、此種稀有之跌風、麥市自不得不步其後塵、總之市面之漲落、須視環境爲轉移、若獨力擯住、恐亦人無能爲力、結果本月分較前日又跌六分之巨、三四月份各跌三分、六月份跌一分、七月份不動、現麥昨市開價已見大跌、較之最高之開價計喊跌二錢之巨、因廠家到此檔口、不但提高殺次、且落得擯低一點也、開南宿麥五兩一錢七分、瑶灣麥五兩一錢七分、共開八千包、由信大辦去六千餘包、餘係福新所去云、</p>
<h3>南北貨</h3>
<p>茹粉繼續飛漲</p>
<p>昨出三百餘包極俏</p>
<p>茹粉自日前增漲後、市上存底殊薄、市形甚俏、而産地汕頭來訊、謂因温台帮向該處搜辦現存已寥、故申地到貨更稀、號盤突然喊高、昨開出三百餘包、皆係統手貨、如源泰益興等牌價爲七兩六錢至七錢、比前盤續升五錢、且勢極挺秀、餘如元和、宏發·中順等牌、則皆無貨以應市、此市形飛黄騰達之所由來也、</p>
<h3>五金</h3>
<p>二號白鉛皮靜極思動</p>
<p>二號白鉛皮爲茶帮之需要品、每届春季銷路必旺、今庚外埠因兵禍匪災、運輸不利、動辦較遲、故至昨日方有某某等三四家開始交易、開出六七十桶、價二十四兩半、比紅盤提五錢、但此後情形、恐有靜極思動之勢、蓋自來火廠工作亦將發動、其他三號至十二號花色趨勢亦優秀不一、如五號九號各帮談交頗衆、故開價亦頗可觀、計五號估二十二兩二錢五分、九號二十一兩二錢五分、此外各種花色則因成交不多、市殊清靜云、</p>

<p>上海臨時法院新協定、已由各國代表簽字、正式公布、定四月一日實行、惟日本因係無約國、此次會議并未參與、新協定亦未簽字、究竟意見如何、頗堪注意、昨日國聞社記者、特往　日代使重光葵、據其請云、「日本對於此次上海臨時法院改組協約、爲宋簽字　、故新協定如何、日本不受拘束、日本仍抱向日態度、繼續與中國交涉、原定主張、并不變更、在四月一日以前、此問題將與其他問題、會同交涉、或有辦法、否則四月一日以後、日本及其他無約國人民訴訟事件、必感棘手也」云云、</p>

<h3>蒸骨相騐案昨日蒸騐結果</h3>
<p>斷定爲自縊身死</p>
<p>屍屬仍聲稱不服</p>
<p>雙方又爭領屍棺</p>
<p>今日仍須審一堂</p>
<p>蘇州閶門開設青蓮閣茶館江北大王陳雙喜之媳陳孫氏（即孫根寳）疑死一家、經地方法院蒸骨相騐各情、已紀昨報、昨日上午八時許、原被兩造、均行報到、兹紀一切詳情如次、</p>
<p>一切屍骨先加洗刷　楊文濬檢察官即偕檢騐員沈錫慶·宣彞芳·宣志明·等蒞騐屍所、啓封後、將一切屍骨、加以刷洗、至午刻十二時許、刷洗完畢、</p>
<p>屍骨入籠隔水烘蒸　即將屍骨置在蒸籠内、隔水烘蒸惟釜钁中置清水一鍋、水内投以甘草茶葉、蓋防水中有弊　　烘蒸後再澆以燒酒　蒸籠内則舖白布、其布上置大批之酒糟、烘蒸一小時後、又澆以燒酒、蓋酒類入内、其熱度易於入骨、</p>
<p>蒸畢後復加以洗刷　蒸至下午二時後　即將屍骨取出、重行洗刷清潔、該檢騐員等即將屍骨置在蓆上、舖成人形、即加檢騐、</p>
<p>耳根手指均有紅色　旋即當衆揭報檢騐狀况、由宣彞芳報告、謂此屍左耳根骨有紅色發現、左手指有紅色、右手指紅色、較左手指爲淡、足指清白、項骨及顱門骨等均無紅色、</p>
<p>自縊者血多往下流　按自縊者其繩環必套在耳根骨處、倘死者之頭向左之一面側、當然左耳根骨吃重、受傷是意中事、而其因自縊之故、在爲胸中抑悶自殺、當然自已欲死、故其血往下流、因是瘀血、凝於手指尖、如果縊久、則血再往下流、瘀血又當凝於足指尖、指尖發紅、即斯故也、</p>
<p>勒斃者後頸當破碎　若被勒、該死者必不願意死、而爲他人所强迫、因强迫之結果、死者於未絕氣時、當然掙扎、而行凶者必愈勒愈緊、其項頸骨第一第二節必有圍繞之痕跡、即骨殖上必當發現色象、後頸之皮膚、因掙扎之關係、必致被繩所勒破、現在對於後頸之皮肉、有一塊保存、遂舉以檢視、並無破碎之跡、　　自縊身死毫無疑義　再或死者係爲人綑缚而勒死、必不能掙扎、但此係自已不願死、其一股氣必向上冲、顱門骨必有色象顯露、此爲一定之理、而項頸骨亦必定有色、現在顱門骨及項頸骨均無色象顯露、完全白潔、僅左耳根骨一處現出傷色、當然爲自縊身死、毫無疑義、於是轟動蘇滬之蒸骨相騐、遂告斷定爲自縊、所有屍骨、遂由楊檢察官命令分别包紮、儲在大木箱内、四周封固存庫、以憑核辦、</p>
<p>死者家屬聲稱不服　楊君即傳原告孫政文·被告陳學寳·開庭預審、訊問棺木誰領、詎兩造均欲具領、官乃諭暫存同仁輔元堂、候訟事結束、再行發落、惟孫政文仍聲稱不服、官諭此案係高等法院指派、如何不服之處、仍向高院請求、並諭次日（即今日）下午二時、兩造再來院訊問、</p>
<p>自縊與被勒之區别　兹節錄檢騐根據之吉林檢騐學習所檢騐新知識「自縊與被勒」内云、雖同爲閉止呼吸斷絕神經之一種、而其骨上痕影、則大有區别、凡自縊者兩耳根有斜形血影之繩痕、其他腦骨牙齒十指尖骨有紅色之血影否、或因繩帶位置之不得、或因懸掛時刻之久暫、如繩在喉上、牙關緊咬、氣血上湧、腦骨牙齒、即現紅色之血影、繩在喉下、牙關不緊、氣血下墜、腦骨牙齒、即無紅色之血影、至十指尖骨之血影、懸掛之時久則現、暫則否、如係被勒、繩痕多在項頸骨第一節第二節間、或平形式、或紫紅色、或紫黯色、較自縊之色爲深重、顖門骨出殻外少許爲淡紅色、或微青色、然亦有成斜形者、其手腕骨宜有繩帶綁縛之痕跡、此即爲自縊與被勒之辨明也、</p>
<h3>各界仕女注意殺害庶母案</h3>
<p>臨時法院昨續審</p>
<p>張文卿貌僅中姿</p>
<p>證人多到案候審</p>
<p>下月七日將續審</p>
<p>已故遜清縣令張福生之二十四歲未嫁女兒張文卿、與所僱傭婦之子陳恒才結合後、圖謀家産、唆使陳糾黨、將庶母張蘇氏殺害、案發一干人犯次第被捕到案、訊供情形、迭記本報、</p>
<p>旁聽者甚爲擁擠　昨日午後、該案由臨時法院羅人驥推事、特開第五法庭、繼續研訊、到庭旁聽之各界仕女、仍甚擁擠、</p>
<p>張文卿截髮蓬蓬　被告張文卿、御元色旗袍、截髮蓬蓬、貌僅中姿、由女所解押到庭、其餘陳恒才·姚樂貴·高錦堂·等三被告、由捕房派捕解送到案、</p>
<p>各方面都有律師　二時半、羅推事升座、領團特派美副領事孟哈特氏列席觀審、張文卿延有王黼裳·蔣保釐·蔣任范剛律師、爲之辯護、而屍屬方面、亦延主延榖等律師出庭、陳述意見、</p>
<p>被傳作證之證人　首由捕房代理律師汝葆彞起立聲稱　前次庭諭捕房調查卡德路七六二號死者住宅之後門止、有無血漬及手印、並飭傳張福生之髮妻張蘇氏及該氏次女張文培·婿殷榮源·曁見證白王氏·等到案、現除白王氏外、餘皆遵傳到案、</p>
<p>捕房不控告張殷　惟屍弟蘇耀庭所具訴狀、將張文培·殷榮源·兩人亦列入本案被告、然據捕房調查所得、該兩人並無嫌疑、故未便一併控告也、</p>
<p>張殷可疑點有二　屍屬方面之律師、即起聲稱、張·殷·兩人、對於本案查有可疑之點二　其一、死者受傷後、張文培趕至紅十字會醫院、得悉乃姊被拘、大肆吵鬧、聲言須交還其姊、其二、張蘇氏死後、張文培即將死者所有物件、悉數取去、應請庭上對此二點、加以偵查</p>
<p>門上無血漬手印　繼由西探長麥克歪倫氏報告出事後調查情形、謂中西探至張家時、見其客堂間内血漬甚多、傷者則倒於地、身被刀傷、探員乃入陳恒才及傭人臥室查察、見室門關閉甚久、灰塵堆積、而門上之漆、多已脫落、並無血漬、亦未顯有手印、縱使當時曾經推門、面同旣像舊不平、斷留遺影云云、</p>
<p>白玉氏離申赴鎭　又據包探丁長源禀稱、昨往閘北恒豐路一百十一號傳喚白王氏、據其家人云、該氏業於日前離申赴鎭、不悉何時返滬云云、</p>
<p>張妻述家庭情况　旋傳張福生之妻張蘇氏　訊據訴稱　原籍天津、現年四十、育兩女、長文卿　尚未出閣、次文培、已適殷榮源爲妻、我夫逝已十載、生前出宰北方、嗣轉商界、任漢口聯和洋行買辦、後乃告退、遂舉家遷滬、並納蘇氏爲妾、迄已十三年、該妾入門六月、即生一子、今亦十有三齡、</p>

<p>據日訊、中國世說新語一書、明代以上刻本久佚、日本現有宋槧兩部、其一在御府、又一在前田侯爵家、侯爵家刻已複製、計上中下三册、又世說叙錄世說人名譜各一册、合計五册、恐爲海内無二之珍籍、御府宋槧本缺叙錄人名譜兩種、而御府本及前田本均有金澤文庫之印章、古文舊書考著者稱其紙張純潔、墨光煥發、刻鏤之妙、色樣之古雅、宋本中所不經見也云云、又京都某古刹藏有世說之古鈔卷子本、賞鑑家定爲唐人手筆、當明治中期初或初期終、由西村某取出、分給好事者多人、現不知散在何處云、</p>
<h3>關稅徵金後日貨輸入轉增</h3>
<p>據日訊、一月上中旬銀市大跌後、對華輸出殆無新成交者、預測對華貿易將起恐慌、適中國宣布關稅徵金、喚起先期輸出、對華輸出至一月一旬反形增加、日郵船由大阪裝運上海之貨、達五·七八五噸、二月一日實行徵金後、仍續呈比較的好况、上旬裝四·一三五噸、預測二月裝貨約一萬二千噸、較上年同期約增六千噸云、</p>

<h3>光華女生宿舍失火</h3>
<p>可怕的是火、可愛的也是火、世間没有人嫉火如仇、當然也不會有人愛火若命、火怎樣會使人生愛、其實例證很多、冬天還没有過去、爐火自然在寳貴之列、火光熊熊、映面作紅、情話喁喁、相視如醉、更不用說了、嗜好紙烟的人、重視一根火柴和一枝烟差不多、愛美的女士們、用火來調馴她們的頭髮、浪暈·碧螺·輕霧·束帛·種種式樣、都仗了火的大力、層層不窮的變化出來、朝鏡子裏看一會、向火酒燈送幾眼、誰敢說伊們不愛火、至於一燈如豆的視火如命、四起炊烟的依火爲生、那簡實超過「可愛」兩字萬倍了</p>
<p>無情的火焰、毁滅一切、大火之後、所餘的除了幾根枯木、一堆殘燼、還有什麽、可憐焦土」這四字、來描寫刦後的火塲、最是確切不移了、可怕的火、來的兀突、去得乾凈、好像擦一根火柴、火光在眼前一現、白挺的梗乾、從頭到尾、就變了枯焦的一段、片刻間因爲火燒而受損失十萬百萬、甚至於有性命的危險、在上海並不是罕有的事、</p>
<p>大西路光華大學的女生宿舍、前天早上、忽然失火、祇燒了大半個小時、那一宅宫殿式的房子、就宣告脫帽了、屋頂完全燒掉、起火的原因、未能確定屬於那一項、聽說燒水汀的爐子間、很有關係、這一燒不打緊、可憐那八十多個女生的箱籠·被褥書箱什物·大半付之一炬、最没趣的要算外埠來的女同學、開學纔一天、東西還没有佈置好、就給火神菩薩没收了、</p>
<p>女生宿舍在東南隅、房子還只是去年暑假蓋的、單這一宅屋子化了一萬二千多塊錢、樓高一層、分作二十四間、裏面有會客室、洗盥室和浴室、餘者都是寢室、屋宇的全部作長方形、屋項四角翹起、像宫殿、在房子的後面靠東南的方向、另外有一間屋子、裏面有一具燒水汀用的鍋爐、一個小小的烟突、直冲在墻壁的外面、水汀的管子通到宿舍裏浴室裏取暖、自從裝設到現在、一向很好的用着、　　前天早上八點鐘、全校都上課了、大約五分鐘之後、女生宿舍便告火警、火勢十分猛烈、從屋頂燒起、趁了風勢直向西北而來、霎時間就不可收拾、校裏職員打電話給救火會、救火會並不近在咫尺、接線又費了許多時候、據救火會的報告、他們得訊在八時二十分、其間當然很費周折了、首先到的救火車、是從靜安寺來的、靜安寺救火會、自然是租界上的、法華鎭雖有一部救火機、能用不能用還是個問題、奔走告急的結果、就是遠水救不得近火、</p>
<p>救火車到了、可是自來水不能從租界上帶來、自流井的水、無濟於事、祇得從王氏墓園裏的浜中取水、好在有抽水機、還能將就灌救、不過水力微細、收效很少、直到屋頂燒燬、樓板燒穿、纔告熄滅、火燒的時候、全塲免不得有一番慌亂、當晚女生宿在東院的教室裏、再設法將門　附近的教員宿舍騰挪出來、作爲本學期的女生宿舍、女生中一部份住在上海的、當天都回家去、星期一可以照常上課、</p>
<p>隔岸觀火、本非文人雅事、瓦礫塲中、却免不了一番憑吊、當天晚上、携了電炬越過空塲去觀看刦後的餘燼、同去的有三個人·幾條狗·兩枝電炬·一桿長槍·一位警士伴同前去、泥地上的積水還没有乾、踏在上面、很帶一點黏性、我們首先繞了屋子一週、尋不到大門年在、走到屋子後面、就看見燒水汀的鍋爐、已經冰冷了、直挺挺的烟突、還靠住墻壁立着、本來生火而可愛的爐子、現在好像受人咒駡之後而在那里唏嘘、</p>
<p>在窗框裏、我們從電炬的光亮中窺見寢室裏的凌亂、檯板枯焦得像炭一般黑燒燬的電線、水汀的管子、東斜西掛、懸在中間、一間寢室裏大約有五六只小鐵床、也都横七豎八、翻來倒去的擱着、被褥衣服書籍等殘片破角、隨地可見、還有許多信件、稿子·抄本等都白花在的抛满一地、這是和普通的火場不同的地方、　　廿四間房間、燒燬的十之八九、祇有洗盥間、還好好的在着、没有受損失、白磁的臉盆、乳白的板壁、冷清清的和四圍底空氣一樣靜穆、我們再踏過空塲、望見對面東西兩院裏燈火輝煌、從窗子裏直射到空塲中來、柔和的空氣、迷漫在夜色之中、不知姑娘們的心中、要怎樣的嗔恨那「火」哩、（霖）</p>

<h3>倫敦之意大利大畫展</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>自今年正月一號到三月七號止、倫敦的白寗頓宫（Burliugton）舉行着一個意大利藝展、這一個展覽會可以說是世界空前的、最偉大的畫展、它搜羅盡了意大利大畫家底傑作、有許多簡直是無價之寳、都是特派專員到各國去運來、凡是意大利·德意志·法蘭西·丹麥·荷蘭·比利時·奥大利·瑞典·美國·英國·愛爾蘭各國、國家美術院博物院及私人收藏的意大利重要畫家底傑作都借來陳列在這個畫展裏頭了、總數在六百件以上、内中意大利運來的佔三百件、英國本國所有的佔一百多件、這六七百件的希世之珍、據說共值一千四百萬鎊以上、合成華幣、就是</p>
<p>二萬萬元</p>
<p>左右了、這筆數目大不大、但是在實際上、這些圖畫底價值着實不止這個數目、因爲内中有許多都是各國的無價之寳、是無論如何不肯出賣的、像這樣的一個大畫展、當然是轟動全歐的了、倫敦人更不必說、没有一個嘴裏不是談到這個畫展的、白寗頓宫地方雖然寛暢、但是去看的人還是多得擠不通、不過這也實在是一個千載難逢的好機會、三四百年來、非走遍羅馬·佛羅倫薩·奈不爾士·威尼司·巴黎·柏林·等大城底美術院不能看到的圖畫、現在在一兩天之内就可以舒舒暢暢的看完了、這樣的好機會、還可以錯過麽、</p>
<p>拉斐爾（Radbael）在凡的干宫（Vatican）的壁畫當然是搬不到英國來的、但是意大利却送過來好些拉斐爾底畫像、米啓安其羅（Michangelo）除了「大衛」之外、其餘的彫刻作品都不能搬來、但是他也有一些繪畫可以代表、此外、約約内（Giorgione）提善（Titian）凡龍尼司（Vetonese）底作品可以代表威尼司的藝術、藍尼（GuidosReni）底作品可以代表奈不爾士、波的珊利（Botticelli）底作品可以代表佛羅倫薩、</p>
<p>米啓安其羅底「大衛」是放在中間的大廳裏、兩旁有杜那但洛（Donatello）和凡洛却（Verrochio）所塑的大衛像、周圍有白尼尼（Bernini）和維多利亞（Vittoria）所作的一些半身像、繪畫是陳列了兩大間、玻璃器皿和工藝物品陳列了一間、現代的意大利彫刻陳列了一間、</p>
<p>差不多意大利繪畫之最值得研究和欣賞的、都在這裏了、意大利大畫家之中、作品最難得最珍貴的、要推約約内、但是他的傑作、這個畫展裏就有了三幅、一幅是「狂風暴雨」一幅是「某男子像」一幅是「摩西受裁判」、蒙丹略（Mantegna）底作品底那種悲劇的美、有著名的「復活」和「十字架上」做代表、在大墻的正中、最尊貴的地位、陳列的是波的珊利底第一傑作、</p>
<h3>「維納司之誕生」</h3>
<p>這一幅圖多少的美啊、看過一遍之後是一生一世不會忘記的、他的傑作一共有好幾幅、如「聖母與聖子」「聖馬格大林底傳說」等、大陳列室的中間有一張幕、在幕上、一邊掛着七幅小圖、一邊掛着八幅、一邊代表佛羅倫薩、一邊代表羅馬、内中有拉斐爾和波的珊利的小件傑作、</p>
<p>威尼司底藝術底代表是提善、他的作品有「狄愛娜與阿克替恩」、「考納洛家族」等、此外有約約納底「淫婦」、陶迷立且諾（Ｄomenichins）底「沙樂美」、考沙（Ｃossa）底無名之士像、此外還有好些的重要作品、因爲太多了、只好不寫出來、</p>
<h3>茄茶諾華</h3>
<p>— 日葵</p>
<p>這是一本在我所披讀過的南歐文學書中「歎觀止矣」的傑作、原文是法文、我隨身携帶的只是一種節錄本、原本共八厚册、書名「茄茶諾華的回憶錄」MemeiresdeCasanova、據說出於茄茶諾華的手筆、全書近二百萬言、節錄本僅及原文十分之一、改名爲LesPlusBellesNuitsdAmoursdoCasanova如譯中文、直畗則爲「茄茶諾華最美麗的愛情之夜」、　　書中所記的都是作者一生愛的生涯的回憶錄、也可以拈句酸文、稱它是一部風流才子的自傳、或脂粉韻事錄、但裏面所記述的、决非近日市上流行的肉麻筆記或性慾的小說所可比擬、</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>讀過中國舊小說的、大家都熟識「花蝴蝶」是一個不道德人物的渾名、在西洋文學裏面、也有一個同樣的人物、他的本領與名聲比中國的「花蝴蝶」不知道要高强得多少、震蕩得多少哩、記得在上海曾經有過一張影片、是映寫他的一部分的生活的開映時似乎經當道嚴行取締、影片譯名「浪蝶採花」、原名「茄茶諾華、」據一般文學考據家、茄茶諾華是十八世紀歐洲的一個著名不道德的人物、因爲他愛過許多許多的婦人、留下一部回憶錄、裏面明明白白記述他生平所經過的一切韻事、發刊的一部分、雖然已經人家校訂過、但是仍列爲不道德的書目下、世界各國都已有譯本、不過大半都遭禁絕發行、但是、這一部天下奇書、經最近文壇權威者的估定、已公認爲一部好的藝術巨著、而且是很道德的是一種訓練賢良丈夫的好書、健全純良的少男少女、讀了這書、一定可以得到一些生活上的享樂、</p>
<p>茹茶諾華與童若望、在西洋文學裏面是一對美姿男子的模型、恰如宗教文學中美麗女性的代表模型聖瑪利亞一樣、是文學中作品常常要提到的兩位女性中心的英雄、</p>
<p>童若望、（或譯唐瓊）是一個傳說中的人物、他因了後世幾位大文豪的描繪、如法國的莫利愛、英國的擺倫、得以垂名不朽、但是他的自身存在問題、待考據者甚多、至於茄茶諾華至少有了他自著的一部回憶錄、我們就可以用眞憑實據來研究他的眞面目、</p>
<p>他是一個女優伶的兒子、生於一七二五年意大利威尼市、是一個天禀異常的神童、年十一、即情竇初開、戀教師女、同年能作拉丁文短詩、他一生的經歷、富豐繁多、而且極複雜幻變、不但在愛情方面、有許多幻異的奇遇、他的身分地位、也是千變萬化、有時候做教士、有時候做軍官、有時候當文人、有時當畫家、或當音樂師、或當伶人、或爲商賈、或爲巫師、或開旅店、或設賭塲、榮貴爲客鄕輔臣、窮蹇爲浪人流犯、舉凡社會間種種境遇層層階級、他都親身體騐、朝爲座上客、夕爲階下囚、在他的生活史上、司空見慣、不足爲奇、他的私人生活史、眞可以當做那時代的社會生活史讀、</p>
<p>他生得身體槐梧、壯健勇强、精神飽满、雙瞳奕奕有光、眼暈似漆、膚色蒼黯、在他容貌與體格上、有一種常人罕有不可思議的奇光神采、使無論那一個婦女見了莫不傾心鍾愛、他待人接物、很親靄慷慨、聰頴靈繁、深諳古代和近代學術、雖篤信宗教、但有自强的精神、他奪取了許多女人的心、但是他從來没有使得一個女人傷心過、他游歷過全歐洲各大都會、如倫敦·柏林·莫斯科·彼得堡·巴黎等等、到處他得美人們的青盼、</p>
<p>下接第九版</p>
<h2>Page 29</h2>
<p>講到他的生活狀况、眞是神秘莫測、没有承襲親族的遺産、也没有受納公家的津貼、他也没有營沾鉅利或獲意外奬金、他一天活一天下去、並没有顧慮到明天、他揮霍奢侈、縱情放慾、酗醉豪賭、非至囊空金盡不止、他每逢日暮途窮的當兒、自會有富貴的婦女來救濟他、據確實的調查、某貴家婦九年中爲他共用去銀錢近百萬之鉅、</p>
<p>他一生所戀愛過的婦女、差不多在回憶錄中都叙寫出了、但他自已寫道、還遺缺有十二個婦女他並不想宣佈、這十二個婦女的姓名、永久秘藏在茹茶諾華的心中了、</p>
<p>他死於一七九七年年七十二歲、遺有回憶錄一種、這是在他暮年時每天用十三個鐘點寫成的一部奇書、</p>
<h3>世界文學的故事（一四一）</h3>
<p>— 美國約翰瑪西着胡仲持譯</p>
<p>第三十七章　維多利亞朝的詩</p>
<p>湯卜遜在善良的友人發見他的天才而救他以前、是悲慘模貧乏而孤獨的、他的華麗絢爛的空想是從生的慘苦的逃避、對於詩人和讀者、詩便是這麽一種的逃避、在宗教底極樂詩「天國的獵狗」中、在尊崇模樣貞潔而高尚的變愛詩「姊妹歌」、及「第恩的滕的變愛」、中又在哀婉的「兒童詩」中、他發見了安慰、他在「罌粟」中、表現了見於莎士比亞的短詩中的那樣、授不滅性於自已的主材和自已的昻然的意識、這一章就以這詩的引用而來終結罷、因爲這說着詩人的故事和那詩人的幻影的最後的勝利的、</p>
<p>戀愛呵、戀愛呵、凋零的夢的你的花在韻律的葉蔭裏、平安地横着、</p>
<p>爲要避刈割的人及那人的刈割者「時」、</p>
<p>在韻律的葉蔭裏藏躱着、</p>
<p>戀愛呵我爲「時」的爪所攫了、</p>
<p>然而韻律的葉蔭裏還遺留着爲這現世所尊重的</p>
<p>凋零的我的夢、凋零的我夢、</p>
<p>第三十八章　十九世紀的法蘭西散文窩爾忒司各脫的華麗而却散文底的羅曼斯以後、遺留着有待創造的是更美更完全的别的羅曼斯、這就是劇而兼叙事詩、華麗而却詩底、現實底而却理想底、眞實而却壯大的羅曼斯、　　丨丨微克忒囂俄</p>

<p>九世紀的最大的文學上的一派、</p>
<p>丨丨喬治白蘭德司</p>
<p>法蘭西文學的羅曼底時代、在時代上又有幾分在精神上相當於英吉利文學的羅曼底復活、而兩者都是有關於包含在法蘭西革命裏的思想的、英吉利的運動、白蘭德司的話且不論、遠比法蘭西的爲强大、而在英吉利、因爲偶然産生了較之法蘭西的更見偉大的文學者、所以那運動更早更豐富地繁榮了、時代（將一八零零年圖表底地作爲牠的中心罷）鼓動英吉利的思想界、便有英吉利的詩人來應和、法蘭西的思想界是沈鬱的、而箕茨及雪萊等、法蘭西直至他們的死後爲止不曾耳聞的人們且不講、足和司各脫及擺侖相比較的文學者在法蘭西至後代方纔出現、從十八世紀的法蘭西的思想界、福耳特耳的個人底名聲雖留存着、但他的澄明辛辣的叡智作爲文學底勢力却消滅了、那時支配底力是經沙多勃易盎轉化爲宗教底情緖和智底反動的盧梭的感傷底羅曼主義、沙多勃易盎的「基督教的精神、」發表於同世紀的初葉、是在法蘭西最有力的新書、這雖夾雜着多量的議論和神學、却是並非用議論或神學的口吻而用色彩和美和象徵主義的口吻的基督教的擁護或讚美、那最劣的處所是說教、那最好的處所則是彩色玻璃和大寺院的風琴、一個揷話即「核耐」的故事、是在全歐羅巴的小說及詩中、屢見不鮮的探求底憧憬底的充满悲哀的年青的魂的羅曼斯、雪萊的「阿拉斯忒」及哥德的「維特」是同一思想丨丨因爲這思想彌漫於當時一般的社會、所以並非直接借來的丨丨的表現、喀萊爾對於這思想全體的頗苛刻的回答是這樣、「青年呵、莫再閑散着、還是去工作罷、」</p>

<h3>Many Central Committee Members Advocate Revoking the Shanxi Public Bond Case</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reliable sources, during the Third Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee on March 1st, multiple committee members jointly proposed that the government revoke the case of issuing 24 million yuan in public bonds to reorganize Shanxi's finances.

The intention was to undermine the financial system on one hand, and to use it as a resource for rebellion on the other; (2) Although the regulations for these public bonds have been announced, the fund committee has not been established, and the government has not yet printed these bonds for sale.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>On the Doctrine of Non-Violent Resistance</h3>
<p>Non-violent resistance is truly one of the most civilized methods in the history of modern national movements. It is also a testament to the progress of modern national movements. The Indian independence movement pioneered this method. Its leader, Gandhi, recently published an article stating that the only danger of non-violent resistance is the occurrence of violent acts. If violence occurs, there are now known methods to deal with it, and there will be no turning back. This non-violent resistance and rejection of violence must continue until no representatives remain alive. He also said that he loves non-violent resistance more than anything in the world. This type of movement, in loving Indians, also stems from loving the British. He is willing to suffer himself to change the hearts of the British, rather than harm them. In essence, he wants to consistently achieve his goals through non-violent resistance and does not want to start with non-violence and end with violence, violating the initial intention of loving oneself and others. Gandhi's words stem from the deep pain of India's repeated tragic sacrifices, and also from the observation that all nations seeking independence initially wanted to avoid violence. However, once the movement begins, violence follows. Violence is the origin of inciting military force. Therefore, Mr. Gandhi takes this as a warning and solely desires to move people with sincerity.</p>
<p>However, seeking independence while consistently maintaining non-violence is very difficult. Yesterday's telegram reported that the Philippine independence movement began boycotting American cigarettes. The Filipinos also want to resist the United States non-violently. However, due to interference with smoking, thirty people were injured within twenty-four hours. There is already fear of inciting violence. More than three thousand students are on strike, demanding the dismissal of American teachers, which is also merely expressing the intention of non-violent resistance. However, students carrying flags and marching, with radical elements taking the opportunity to incite and distribute pamphlets criticizing leaders, raise concerns that violence will occur if the authorities do not handle it calmly. Therefore, using non-violent resistance as a movement while avoiding violence is indeed not easy. Although Mr. Gandhi's intentions are good, and although there are methods of handling, it is feared that it will not be easy to achieve his goals.</p>
<p>I have always said that in all the world's disputes, no matter what the matter, people initially want to resolve it through peaceful means. However, after several twists and turns and changes, they unknowingly change their original intentions and ultimately create a situation where non-violent resolution is impossible. There are many examples. The recent major powers' disarmament conference hoped for world peace and wanted to resolve international disputes non-violently. However, will the conference's results truly achieve this great accomplishment? In the future, will all international disputes be resolved non-violently? No one dares to say for sure. Therefore, the doctrine of non-violent resistance is difficult to express. Domestic Telegram Three</p>

<p>Fuzhou Yang Shuzhuang telegram: To all newspapers: I have recently read the telegrams of rebuke to Mr. Yan Baichuan from the presidents Hu, Tan and Wang, words stern and righteousness upright, I deeply admire. The unification of the Republic of China has now been for three years. The people within the country eagerly await governance. But the warlords love chaos. It starts with differences of opinion, followed by the disaster of soldiers and weaponry. This one follows the other, continuous years of unease. Generalissimo Chiang’s original intention was peace. He resorted to force because there was no other way. Heaven assists the party and the country, gradually pacifying. At this point, it is right to work together to overcome the difficulties and strive to build. However, if one falsely claims high repute and shakes the public mind; calls it concession and in reality starts disputes; it is hoped that those who hold local responsibilities will remove personal selfish intentions, each fulfill their own responsibility, realize political tutelage, so as to build a stable foundation. Whoever initiates disaster will become a public enemy. Shuzhuang is loyal to the party and the country, having personally experienced hardships, and I would be remiss to remain silent about what I think is dangerous. My humble thoughts, I beseech public judgment, Yang Shuzhuang kowtows.</p>

<h3>Central Propaganda Department Issues Letter to Fellow Countrymen</h3>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>Since the feudal warlords want to privately possess the people's military force, they must first seize the state-owned territory. Every province and every county is made into a private fiefdom. Every donation and every tax goes into their private pockets. Merchants and travelers already suffer from donations and taxes, but the Central Government has not seen any clear documents of reporting. Farmers and workers are exhausted from conscription and requisitions, but the Central Government has not heard any direct complaints. What is even worse is that in the areas occupied by feudal forces, without the permission of the Central Government and without the knowledge of the people, they issue large amounts of unredeemable paper money to extract the people's cash. The officials drive, bundling and carrying away. The people's blood and sweat are exhausted, and the summons for food and taxes does not cease. When the people's anger is aroused, they blame the Central Government for not providing assistance. If it becomes impossible to cover up, they claim that it is their duty to maintain the locality. The finances of a country, the income of the central government and the localities, originally had a clear division, and there was also a designated use. Now the feudal forces have seized the local income and intercepted the taxes of the central government, yet they still demand more and more, making it impossible for the local administration to take action, and the central government is even more unable to cope. If they get it, they will temporarily get along in peace; if they are short, they will immediately rebel. This kind of greedy and ferocious villain should not be allowed to survive under the blue sky and white sun. However, the central government still gives advice at any time. If it is possible to quell the chaos invisibly, and not allow the people to suffer greater sacrifices, they all give preferential treatment. My fellow countrymen have all personally experienced these facts. Do they also know the feudal forces are reliable?</p>
<p>In the recent gold-expensive and silver-cheap trend, those in the know all know that it is a poisonous trick used by imperialists to suppress China's national movement. However, as our country is both poor and weak, to this point, if we want to fundamentally remedy it, we must strive to stabilize the people's livelihood and develop production. There is really no other way out. If we want stable living and developed production, we must first strive for peace to restore the vitality of society, and maintain unification so that transportation can be smooth and unhindered. Now that the feudal forces are entrenched in the localities, intensifying the exploitation of my people who have no time to save themselves, how can vitality be restored? As for transportation, it is even more heartbreaking to talk about it. Among all the transportation facilities in our country, apart from the fact that most of the navigation rights have been seized by foreigners and are still waiting to be recovered, the only thing we can rely on to transport goods and connect the four directions is the mere six or seven thousand miles of railway. Most of these short-distance railways are located in the north, and are even more important for the livelihood of the people of North China. However, the feudal forces not only do not think of using it to enrich the people's livelihood, but even destroy it in order to seek to resist by force. For example, on the Jinpu, Pinghan, Pingsui, Longhai, and Pingjin lines, my fellow countrymen should investigate: Is the amount of money intercepted by the local government every day often more than eight or nine out of ten? Also know that of the thousands of wagons on each route, the number that merchants and travelers can use is often less than one or two out of ten, and the rest are stolen and occupied by the feudal forces. Also know that the goods and raw materials produced by workers and peasants every year are intercepted and used by the feudal armies because they cannot be transported for export. It is not that my fellow countrymen do not know how to work hard and painstakingly to increase production. It is not that the central government is determined to follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's nation-building legacy to lay railways across the country. However, the feudal forces are actually taking advantage of the extreme intensity of the economic aggression of imperialism and the urgent need for material construction of the people to rise up and greatly hinder the country's only transportation, making the current production enterprises lose their dependence, and plunging the future livelihoods into a desperate situation. This is the suffering experienced by my fellow countrymen. If we do not lift ourselves up to promote true unification, we will leave endless worries. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Chen Yaohan's Brigade Reorganized into a Division</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: After the Chen Yaohan's Independent First Brigade was ordered to be reorganized into the 26th Division, the entire brigade moved from Huaiyuan to Xinan Town. Chen has already deployed the brigade's reorganization into a division in Huaiyuan, but the organizational structure has not yet been completed. Its departure procedure is divided into six trains. The first two trains contain the Zhu Zhenzhi regiment and the cavalry and engineer companies. The third and fourth trains contain the Zhao Liguo regiment and the machine gun companies. The fifth and sixth trains contain the Zhang Guangyuan regiment and the newly formed battalion and headquarters special service platoon. Currently, the first and second trains have passed Xuzhou from Bengbu and arrived at the Grand Canal. The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth trains will also continue to pass through Xuzhou. After the reorganization into a division, the chief of staff will be Sun Yixin, and the two brigade commanders have been determined to be promoted from the Zhao and Zhang regimental commanders. The entire division will be formed into two brigades and four regiments. All the required military officers were examined and rated by Chen himself in Huaiyuan and submitted for appointment.

<h3>Mishap at Bengbu Ammunition Depot</h3>
<p>Shells Explode Due to Warmer Weather</p>
<p>Only Three Houses Destroyed</p>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: At the foot of Nanshan in Bengbu, there is an ammunition depot built during Ni Sichong's governance of Anhui. It is located five li south of the city center. It has been more than ten years since its construction. The houses in front of the depot were converted into a rural normal school last summer. Behind the school, there are three houses containing twenty-three bombs stored by the former Anwu Army and over a hundred shells stored by the Zhili-Shandong Army. There were also many bullets, all placed on the ground without anyone guarding them. Recently, as the weather has gradually warmed, the ammunition has become unstable. At five o'clock in the morning on the 18th, a shell exploded with a thunderous sound, as if a bolt from the blue. Houses in the city shook, and residents were bewildered and uncertain. Rumors spread that a large company's building had collapsed. At eight o'clock in the morning, the shells exploded twice more, and at eleven o'clock, they exploded again, but with a smaller sound. Afterwards, the Public Security Bureau dispatched inspectors Jiang Xinmin, Ge Zhenting, and Chen Jianxun to investigate. According to reports, the three houses where the ammunition depot stored bullets had been destroyed by the shells. Smoke was still rising, making it impossible to get close. Later, the security team and the fire brigade were also ordered to send people to investigate. It was reported that the roofs of the destroyed houses had been blown off, and only one wall remained, with the other three walls collapsed. The power of the explosives can be imagined. Inquiries with the watchmen of the rural normal school also yielded no explanation. Fortunately, the school had not yet started, otherwise, many people would have been frightened. (February 19th)</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>Oath-Taking Ceremony for Hubei Provincial Government Committee Members</h3>
<p>Liu Wendao and Zhang Fujia Represent the Central Government and National Government as Supervisors</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The newly appointed Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, He Chengjun, and Committee Members Huang Changgui, Zhang Guanshi, Xiong Bingkun, Peng Jieshi, Fang Dazhi, and Xie Lü held an oath-taking ceremony at the Provincial Government Auditorium on the 18th. Liu Wendao, Mayor of Hankou, represented the Central Government as supervisor, and Zhang Fujia, President of the High Court, represented the National Government's Executive Yuan as supervisor. Guests included Chen Cheng, Commander of the 11th Division, Yin Zusheng, Commander of the Fortress, Qian Dajun, Director of Education at the Wuhan Military Academy, Lu Xiaochen, representative of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and Yue Weijun, Li Yunlong, Peng Qibiao, Peng Jinzhi, Jin Yiwu, Chen Zulie, Zuo Feng, Liu Baifang, members of the Provincial Party Headquarters, and Cha Guangfo, Wang Yiqun, members of the Municipal Party Headquarters, as well as representatives from various agencies and organizations. Chairman Liu Wendao conducted the ceremony. Afterwards, Supervisor Liu Wendao presented the seals, and the Chairman and various department heads received the seals. Then, Supervisor delivered a speech, stating that it was an honor to be appointed by the Central Party Headquarters to attend the inauguration ceremony of Chairman He and the Committee Members. With the military situation now at an end, Chairman He has returned to personally govern the province. However, the current situation is becoming tense again. Although Chairman He and the Committee Members have taken the relief of the Hubei people's suffering as their responsibility, they must also deal with foreign aggression, which is truly unfortunate for the people of Hubei. Wuhan is the shield of the capital, and Hubei Province must station at least 100,000 troops to protect the entire country. Therefore, the safety of Hubei Province is crucial to the overall situation. The Chairman, who bears such a heavy responsibility, must first have a broad mind and second, bear the hopes of all parties, both North and South, in order to fulfill this responsibility. Chairman He has a long and distinguished record in the history of the revolution, unlike anyone who only focuses on local concerns. Therefore, it is hoped that Chairman He's administration and appointment of personnel in the province will be based on this principle. Next, Zhang Fujia delivered a speech on behalf of the National Government, stating that it was an honor to represent the National Government as supervisor at the oath-taking ceremony of Chairman He and the Committee Members. Now that we have entered the period of political tutelage, if those in power do not work hard to build the country, the Three Principles of the People cannot be realized. I believe that the people of the province are delighted with Chairman He's return and expect that he will be able to rectify the provincial administration and seek the welfare of the local people. It is hoped that Chairman He and the Committee Members will work hard to build the country and relieve the suffering of the people. Next, Liu Baifang of the Provincial Party Rectification Committee and Wang Yiqun of the Municipal Party Rectification Committee delivered speeches successively. Then, He Chengjun delivered a reply, stating that he was grateful for the speeches of the supervisors from the Central Government and the National Government and the teachings of the members of the Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters. He would certainly act in accordance with their instructions. He had repeatedly stated that he came entirely to work, not to hold office, and that the various department heads and committee members came to Hubei solely to reorganize the region and build the revolutionary cause. Regarding the past disharmony between the Party and the government mentioned by the Provincial and Municipal Party Committee members, he dared to guarantee that such phenomena would not occur in the future. He would adopt a meritocratic approach to personnel selection, and his financial policy would be based on integrity. After He's speech, a group photo was taken, and the meeting adjourned. A telegram was sent to the Central Government's National Government Executive Yuan to report the inauguration. (February 19th)</p>
<h3>New Regulations for the Appointment of County Magistrates in Hunan Province</h3>
<p>Establishment of a County Magistrate Qualification Review Committee</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch, 19th: In the past two years, Hunan Province has held two county magistrate examinations. The first was in August of the 17th year, when Lu Dipin presided over the Hunan government, and sixty people, including Wang Cuntong, were selected. They were appointed immediately after the results were announced. The second was in June of the 18th year, during He Jian's term, and thirty people, including Tang Youyue, were selected. Currently, twenty-seven have been assigned, leaving only three unassigned. The results of the past county magistrate appointments show that the county magistrates selected in the first examination were mostly young students with no experience, resulting in many farcical situations. For example, County Magistrate Liu of Baoqing County was unfamiliar with official document formats and made the embarrassing mistake of writing "Respectfully, for your compliance with the order." The county magistrates selected in the second examination were appointed after two or three months of apprenticeship, giving them some experience. However, most of the candidates were teachers and students with no prospects. People with a reputation for integrity and political acumen were unwilling to take the exam. Since county magistrates who were not selected through examination could not be appointed, it was regrettable to discard the talented people who were unwilling to take the exam. He Jian and the members of the provincial government discussed the matter repeatedly and decided to change the appointment method, abandoning the examination system to ensure that both new and old talents could be employed. The Civil Affairs Department drafted the Provisional Regulations for the Appointment of County Magistrates in Hunan Province and the Organizational Regulations for the Qualification Review Committee for the Appointment of County Magistrates in Hunan Province, which were submitted and passed at the Provincial Affairs Conference on February 18th. Hu Yuantan, Chen Runlin, Feng Tianzhu, Liu Yuezhi, Zhang Jiong, Zhao Heng, Peng Zhaohuan, Chen Changzu, Xiang Shaoxuan, Zeng Jiwu, Cao Dianqiu, Song Hegeng, Zhang Kailian, Huang Shiheng, Cao Bowen, and Yi Shuzhu were appointed as members of the Qualification Review Committee for County Magistrates in Hunan, with He Jian serving as the Chairman. The review began that day. The two regulations are recorded below to observe the changes in the appointment of county magistrates in Hunan Province.</p>

(Article 9) If there are any matters not covered in these regulations, they shall be resolved by this committee and reported to the provincial government for record. (Article 10) These regulations shall be promulgated and implemented after resolution by the Provincial Government Committee.</p>
<h3>Shandong River Conservancy Conference Concludes</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Shandong Provincial River Conservancy Committee held its second plenary committee meeting at 3:00 PM on the 18th. The attending committee members were Li Rupu, Ge Xiangyi, Song Wentian, Cui Shijie, Chen Luanshu, and Cao Xinben. Chen Luanshu chaired the meeting. The following matters were discussed: (1) The River Conservancy Committee's budget proposal was passed as amended (recurring expenses from February to June: 1855 yuan; temporary expenses: 23,500 yuan). (2) Committee Member Li proposed a plan to reform the River Affairs Bureau's method of purchasing straw. It was resolved to pass the plan as proposed: when purchasing materials for inspection, the committee and the River Affairs Bureau shall jointly send personnel to the site for inspection, and the provincial government shall allocate funds on time. (3) Committee Member Li proposed a resolution regarding fundraising for the construction of a dike at Jikou and maintaining official ownership and maintenance after completion. It was resolved to pass the plan as proposed. (4) A letter from the Relief Committee regarding two cases requesting the allocation of relief funds for dike construction in De County and Xiajin was considered. It was resolved to petition the provincial government; matters outside the committee's scope should be handled by the Construction Department. (5) Committee Member Li proposed a petition to the provincial government ordering the Construction Department to dredge the lower reaches of the Tuhai River to facilitate water flow. It was resolved to pass the plan as proposed. (6) An order was given for the River Affairs Bureau to report on the convening of people's embankment meetings and the regulations for repair and maintenance. It was resolved to pass the plan as proposed, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>The Liuzhuang River Conservancy project on the upper reaches of the Yellow River, which involves constructing a stone dam, requires 240,000 yuan. The provincial government previously resolved that the Finance Department should allocate 120,000 yuan, and the eight counties under Caozhou prefecture should share the remaining 120,000 yuan, which would be collected as a surcharge on the summer grain tax this year. The Finance Department is currently making preparations for this. Based on the total of 520,000 yuan in taxes for the eight counties under Caozhou prefecture, allocating 120,000 yuan would require an additional charge of over 20 cents per yuan. The resolution of the River Conservancy Committee is recorded below: "It is found that the Liuzhuang River Conservancy project on the south bank of the Yellow River in Hebei Province, though the project is in Hebei, the damage is in Shandong. At the end of last year, the Hebei Promotion Association of the eight counties under Caozhou prefecture submitted a petition to the provincial government, requesting an allocation of funds to repair the stone dam due to the dangerous conditions of the project. The 45th Provincial Government Standing Committee referred it for review. The review committee examined the results and decided to add four stone dams to the project, requiring a total of 240,000 yuan. It was stipulated that three dams should be built in the first half of the 19th year and one dam in the second half of the year. The expenses were to be allocated 120,000 yuan from the special river conservancy fund and 120,000 yuan from a temporary mu tax levied once on the land of the eight counties under Caozhou prefecture. The Finance Department was to collect the tax once in the first half of the 19th year and remit it to the River Conservancy Committee for application. The 48th Standing Committee meeting approved the original proposal. It is now found that the stone materials for the Liuzhuang dam repair must be purchased from Gong County, which is a long distance away and transportation will take time. If preparations are not made early, it may be difficult to complete before the flood season. It is proposed that this committee submit a petition to the provincial government, ordering the County Administration Department to quickly allocate the special river conservancy fund and distribute the number of temporary mu taxes to be added to each county, ordering Heze, Shan County, Cao County, Dingtao, Juye, Pu County, and Yuncheng counties under Caozhou prefecture to quickly initiate the collection and remit the funds to the Finance Department, so that personnel can be dispatched to start work."</p>
<h3>Military News from the Northeast Reorganization</h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Although the Russian war has ended, the national crisis is still deep.

<h3>Japanese Police Arrest Korean Residents En Masse in Harbin</h3>
<p>Leader Kim Hak-jin Arrested</p>
<p>Korean Students in Yanbian Also Arrested</p>
<p>Our National Sovereignty is Truly Lamentable</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Since last September, Japanese police in Harbin, within our complete national territory, have been closely monitoring and secretly investigating the actions of Koreans in Harbin after learning about the Korean national self-determination movement. Comparing it to the Gwangju Incident in Korea, which aroused the overall indignation of the Korean people, the Korean national self-determination movement is becoming increasingly fierce. The Harbin Japanese police have therefore intensified their searches, and finally, on the night of the 10th of this month, they suddenly arrested Korean patriot Kim Hak-jin, the mastermind, and arrested his comrades Kim Tae-bu, Kim Yong-beop, Son Seong-bo, Bon Yong-cheon, and Kim Soon-hak.</p>
<p>Previously, after the Japanese police discovered leaflets with a declaration of indignation from Koreans in Harbin, they became convinced that Korean patriots were hiding here. Therefore, they worked day and night to investigate. At around 7:00 PM on the 10th, Kim Tae-bu was arrested in Kim Tae-bu's home on Toulong Street. At the same time, Kim Yong-beop, Son Seong-bo, and Lee Yong-cheon were arrested in a Korean inn in Daowai. Kim Soon-hak was arrested on Daan Street. Seeing that their mission was nearing completion, the Japanese police became even more elated and carried out activities throughout the night. Finally, at around 3:00 AM the next day (the 11th), they arrested the leader, Kim Hak-jin. At the time, Kim was hiding in a brothel on Yimian Street to conceal himself. After being broken in on by the Japanese police, he remained calm and was arrested without any fear or alarm. It is reported that Kim is only 23 years old, a handsome and gentle young man who speaks several languages. He has been running around and campaigning for years, enduring hardships. Wherever he goes, Koreans are moved by him. It is lamentable that this political prisoner in our country's territory was publicly arrested by the Japanese police. On the 12th and 13th, the Japanese police continued to arrest many Koreans in various places.</p>
<p>Also, since the outbreak of the anti-Japanese movement by students across Korea, Korean youths in Longjing Village, Yanbian, have been quite moved and have been brewing an anti-Japanese movement in response to the country's student circles. However, they were extremely secretive beforehand, and outsiders knew little about the situation. Suddenly, more than 100 students from Myongsin and Eunzin schools (both schools run by Koreans) formed a team and paraded, shouting slogans such as "Long Live Korean Independence" and "Down with Japanese Imperialism," and distributing anti-Japanese leaflets along the way. The order was well maintained, and the situation was tragic. Our Public Security Bureau, fearing misunderstandings, was about to send police to stop them, but the Japanese Consulate dispatched a large team of armed police without notifying us, swarming forward and dispersing the Korean students, arresting many of them. Because the Japanese police came on strong, they did not argue, so no major changes were made. However, since this incident, the Japanese have continued to report Korean youths in the area, and Koreans have been in a state of fear. (February 15th)</p>
<h3>Heilongjiang Province Plans to Build the Qina Railway</h3>
<p>To Prepare for the Extension of the Qiqihar-Heihe Line</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch, 15th: In recent years, Heilongjiang Province has spared no effort in railway construction. The province's Construction Department previously proposed allocating funds from the Boxer Indemnity to build the Qiqihar-Heihe Railway and submitted it to the Northeast Transportation Committee through the Provincial Government. The Transportation Committee sent a report to the Ministry of Railways for review. At the same time, the Provincial Government ordered the Construction Department to submit a preliminary route map and a cost estimate for the Qiqihar-Heihe Railway for verification. Currently, the Heilongjiang Provincial Government believes that the simultaneous construction of the entire line is a massive project and plans to build it in stages, starting with the section between Qiqihar and Nehe, starting from the Ningnian Station of the Qike Railway (already completed), heading northeast through Laha Station to Nehe County, a distance of 120 li. Last month, a telegram was sent to Cui Fukun, the county magistrate of Nehe County, to convene gentry and merchants of the county to solicit their opinions, which were all very supportive. The county magistrate arrived in the province from Nehe a few days ago to present everything in person. The construction of this road will be realized soon. In the future, it can continue to be extended from Nehe to Nenjiang, a distance of 160 li, and from Nenjiang to Heihe, a distance of 480 li.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Negotiations between Two Districts to Dredge Rivers: The Guanshao Pond and Maojing Rivers, located in the suburban areas of the city, serve as crucial irrigation arteries for farmers. Due to years of neglect, the river water has dried up, causing hardship to local residents who have been jointly seeking to dredge them. After district resident Chen Yiqing and others petitioned the county government, the First and Second District Public Offices were instructed to confer on how to proceed. The two district chiefs, Zhong and Fu, convened relevant local figures today (the 21st) at the First District Public Office to discuss dredging methods. The following resolutions were made: (1) The Guanshao Pond and Maojing Rivers will be jointly dredged by the First and Second Districts. The portion of the Guanshao Pond within the Second District will be addressed after the Second District Chief consults local opinions. The portion within the First District will be dredged concurrently with the Maojing River. (2) A Dredging Bureau will be established jointly by the First and Second Districts, with designated staff responsible for various tasks.

<h3>A Note on Two Young Friends, the Guan Brothers</h3>
<p>— Fearless Hermit</p>
<p>Master Wang Jingfu recently came to Shanghai from Hangzhou. He arranged a visit to Mr. Guan Yunong's residence to see his two sons, Dexin and Deshang. Dexin is just thirteen, and Deshang is not yet ten. Both are Master Jingfu's former outstanding students.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the Guan residence, Dexin and Deshang greeted us with grace and politeness. Their demeanor was refined, and their eyes sparkled with intelligence. Master Jingfu told me, "These are truly fine young men in this chaotic world." I said that it clearly demonstrates the beauty and excellence of their family education.</p>
<p>In the guest room, a photograph of the two young friends hung above. Beside it was a couplet written by Dexin in an elegant and vigorous hand, skillfully using square strokes. The lines were, "Chrysanthemums bloom late by the eastern fence, plum blossoms open cold on the northern ridge." Attached was a postscript, noting that he composed the couplet at the age of eight. Master Jingfu also showed me their recent works. They were composed and natural. He kindly gave me a copy of their revised versions. Each essay, though only a few lines long, was concise and meaningful. Within a small space, they conveyed a sense of vastness. Their five-character quatrains were full of ancient charm. They were skilled at using metaphors in their writing, often creating wonderful, ethereal imagery. Mr. Gao Yihan often praised them without end. That day, Mr. Yunong was out. I visited again the next day. During our conversation, after I had just composed the first line of the couplet "Chrysanthemums bloom late by the eastern fence," Mr. Xu Jingren arrived and praised it greatly. He also writes and can write large celebratory prefaces of thousands of words, consistently from beginning to end. Deshang is younger and models his calligraphy after Yan Zhenqing. He showed me his daily practice, which had a certain vigor. In the past, Kong Rong met Taishi Ci and jokingly called him "little friend." I also wished to presume to do the same. Scholarly habits are hard to shake off. How laughable!</p>
<h3>The Strange Tale of the Golden Tangyuan</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xu</p>
<p>Although I, Zhu Xu, use "emptiness" as my pen name, I have never believed in mystical or absurd things. Even if I hear of them, I scoff. During what the old calendar calls the Lantern Festival, I came to Shanghai from Suzhou, hurriedly took off my stage makeup, and went to visit my cousin Chen Xinyi on East Youheng Road. I had barely sat down when the maid began to chatter about the golden tangyuan, even pointing at her mistress and saying that her efforts had fallen short of success. My cousin also gestured and explained, even citing my nephew Huang Liwen as a witness, saying he had seen it with his own eyes. After listening carefully, although I couldn't help but call it strange, I couldn't completely dismiss it as false. I will record it to seek research from philosophers and scientists at home and abroad. According to tradition, on the first day of the old lunar year, people must cook tangyuan to offer to ancestors and entertain guests. They must also start working on the tangyuan pot at the fifth watch on New Year's Eve. That is because offerings to gods and ancestors are all done at dawn. My cousin's family couldn't escape the custom and continued the custom of previous years, supervising the family to prepare respectfully. After the family division on New Year's Eve, when the red candles had burned three inches and the spring had reported five watches, the young mistress, Madam Zhuo Liwu, was pacing in front of the hall, estimating the cups and chopsticks in the sacrificial ritual. The maid, Hu, suddenly came forward to congratulate her. Madam took it as a New Year's greeting and smiled in response. The maid said, "Congratulations, young mistress! The pot is full of golden tangyuan!" The Madam was originally from Huaibei. She had long heard the Huaibei tradition of tangyuan turning into gold on New Year's Day. She was immediately surprised and happy. She went into the kitchen and lifted the pot lid to look. The broth was boiling like ocean waves, but the tangyuan were not floating on top. Every round ball was submerged at the bottom of the pot, golden yellow. This made the clear white of the boiling broth in the pot even more distinct. But Hu had already collapsed on the floor. In the blink of an eye, the Madam suddenly scooped up a potful with a shovel. Hu was shocked and said, "It's ruined!" And the tangyuan floated as usual, but were not white but yellow. My cousin, Xinyi, arrived after hearing the news and also sighed in despair, saying, "It's fate. You can't force it." So they were still used for the offering and then eaten. My nephew, Liwen, who lived nearby, came to offer New Year's greetings and also tasted them. They were hard and difficult to chew, and the sesame filling inside had all turned to dust. The taste of earth filled the mouth. Hu also greatly regretted not telling the Madam the method earlier. According to Hu, when the pot lid is opened, a piece of gold jewelry should be quickly thrown into the pot. Cover and add fire, and cover the pot lid with silk fabric to prevent air from escaping. After about two hours, all the balls will become solid gold. It is also said that this method was passed down in the He family of Huai'an. The He family had such an event during the Jiaqing era of the Qing Dynasty. I, Zhu Xu, am not clever and still regard it as a groundless matter. But the speakers are not just hearing things. My cousin even kept a tangyuan and showed it to me. It was yellow and hard, and made a sound when thrown, and was dry without cracking. My cousin's husband, Zhu Muzhai, said that he heard from elders that the stove is made of earth, the fuel is wood, and the pot is made of gold. It also contains water and fire is added. The five elements are complete, so it can be melted into gold. The words seem to make sense but also don't. I still call it a strange tale.</p>
<h3>Research on Conjoined Twins Connected at the Abdomen</h3>
<p>— Xiu Jun</p>
<p>In the third installment of Tianlu Jun's overseas tea talks, it was mentioned that at the Tokyo Municipal Hospital's delivery room, a mother gave birth to conjoined twins, connected at the abdomen, sharing one stomach and having three legs between them. The mother passed away due to postpartum anemia, while the twins were exceptionally healthy (as seen in this month's 5th article). At first, I couldn't help but find it strange. However, after extensive research, I learned that historical records and local chronicles contain numerous similar cases, making the matter less extraordinary. A detailed account follows:</p>
<p>The Book of Jin, Record of the Five Elements, states: "In the fourth year of Emperor Min's Jianxing era, Ren Qiao, a county official of Xincai County, had a wife who gave birth to two daughters. Their abdomens and hearts were joined, with each separate from the chest upwards and from the navel downwards." The Book of Southern Qi, Record of the Five Elements, states: "In the fifth year of Emperor Wu's Yongming era, Wu Xiu, a migrant from Dongqian, Wuxing, had a wife who gave birth to two children. They were joined from below the chest to above the navel." The Book of Tang, Record of the Five Elements, states: "In the third year of Emperor Gaozong's Yifeng era, in the fourth month, Jing Prefecture presented two infants with conjoined hearts but separate bodies. Initially, the wife of Hu Wannian, a guardsman of Chuncan County, gave birth to a boy and a girl, whose chests were connected but the rest of their bodies were separate. When they were separated, both died. Another birth occurred in the same way, both boys. They were raised, and at the age of four, they were presented to the court." The Shanxi General Gazetteer states: "In the summer of the thirty-eighth year of the Wanli era, Niu, the wife of Li Yichen of Fanshi County, gave birth to two daughters, their heads and faces connected, but their hands and feet were separate."</p>
<p>The two daughters of Ren Qiao, each separate from the chest upwards and from the navel downwards, are clearly conjoined at the abdomen. The twins of Wu Xiu's family, joined from below the chest to above the navel, are also clearly conjoined at the abdomen. The two infants of Jing Prefecture, with conjoined hearts but separate bodies, are also clearly conjoined at the abdomen. Only the two daughters born to the wife of Li Yichen, with their heads and faces connected, are slightly different. However, according to the Second Shen Wild Records, it is said that one girl had one eye, one ear, four teeth, two hands, and two feet, while the other girl had one eye, one ear, four teeth, one hand, and two feet. These two girls shared three hands, similar to the Tokyo twins sharing three legs, which can be compared. However, the term "three hands" is rather unrefined. The Seven Revisions Collection records that during the Jiajing era, there was a three-legged cat at the Nanjing Shenle Temple, which was very good at catching mice but could not walk properly. Now, when people do things not entirely legally but are quite good at imitating them, it is called a "three-legged cat," which is actually based on this. It is unknown what the future holds for the Tokyo twins. However, since they have three legs, they will likely be quick to get things done. Alas, different roots sharing the same body are called linked branches, and different fields sharing the same ear are called auspicious grains. Differences in plants are still considered auspicious omens. Now, conjoined twins are connected at the abdomen. Does this mean "two people with the same mind can break gold"? I am filled with emotion.</p>

<p>I have a fondness for fruit and find it indispensable daily. In the late Qing Dynasty, I served my father on his official travels in Lingnan. Lingnan is close to the tropics and produces many fine fruits, allowing me to indulge even more.</p>
<p>Lychee is a specialty of Lingnan, with a sweet taste and rich flesh, possessing a unique flavor. In the past, Yang Guifei loved to eat lychees. If I were to compare fruits to beauties, then the lychee is undoubtedly the Yang Guifei among fruits. Within the Zengcheng County government office, there is a lychee tree, with a tall trunk and lush branches. Each fruit it bears has a line of green on its shell, bright and eye-catching, unlike any other place. It is said that in the past, a county magistrate had an exceptionally intelligent daughter who loved this tree very much. Every day, she would read and embroider under its green shade. When tired of embroidering, she would playfully chew on the green silk and spit it onto the branches. Later, the daughter died and was buried under the tree. Her spirit, finding refuge there, transformed into this. The Cantonese affectionately call it the "Hanging Green Lychee." Although this is close to mythology and cannot be fully believed, the story is exceptionally elegant. During times of peace, the county magistrate would regularly present twenty lychees to the court by express mail. He would also give some to high-ranking officials and colleagues in the province, usually four to the governor-general and two to others. Now that the years have changed frequently, I wonder if the tree is still there.</p>
<p>Gambling is prevalent in Guangdong Province and has been for a long time. Their gambling techniques are particularly unimaginable. The strangest is to hang a yellow orange in the air and have people guess how many seeds are inside. After the bets are placed, the orange is cut open in public and the seeds are counted to determine the winner. This is how fruit is used as a gambling tool.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Tang Bihua</p>
<p>When wearing a felt hat and riding a tram, be sure not to sit near an open window, because you might have your hat snatched (that is, someone might steal your felt hat). So, better safe than sorry, stand rather than sit.</p>
<p>When taking a rickshaw, don't let him take small roads. Beware of the rickshaw puller colluding with criminals to carry out a "peeling the pig" operation.</p>
<p>When buying things at stores like Sincere, Wing On, and Sun Sun, if you encounter items that are inconvenient to carry, you can give your name and address to the staff, and they will deliver the items to your home. Pay upon delivery, and you don't have to give any tips.</p>
<p>You need to save face in other matters, but when seeing a doctor, don't try to save face. It's best to always complain about your suffering. That way, the doctor's prescription will be much cheaper.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Comedian's Comedy Films</h3>
<p>— Zong Di</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Zhuodai, a domestically produced comedian recognized by the world, was originally an athlete who enjoyed writing humorous novels. He initially often appeared on stage in theatrical roles and once ran a film company. Recently, he worked in the Bureau of Education and is now a member of a certain association. This man's career has changed so often that he truly deserves to be called today's "rolling stone." The Great China Record Company, admiring his reputation, specially invited him to record, producing half a dozen records. At a spring banquet at a friend's house the other day, the friend played them on a phonograph. They were all humorous and funny, causing people to laugh. The eight or nine people sitting around all laughed so hard they couldn't close their mouths. "Reading Notices," "A Head-Cutting Business," and "Investigating Household Registration" were especially imaginative. Just hearing the names is enough to make people smile. It is said that all the scripts for Mr. Xu's recent recordings were written by himself, so they are not derivative of anyone else's work. They prevent people from having a stale or repetitive feeling. If people like comedy and comedies, their sales will surely be no less than the "Collection of Unintelligible Words."</p>
<h3>European Correspondence (42)</h3>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>The Death of Bourdelle Antoine Bourdelle</p>
<p>3. His Art (Part 1)</p>
<p>Antoine Bourdelle is dead. An artist who was always moving forward on the path to perfection is dead. Like Ingres, he was from the Montauban region of southern France. Born in 1862, he also lived to be sixty-nine years old like Ingres. Initially, he studied mural painting and sculpture at the Toulouse School of Fine Arts. He then entered the Paris School of Fine Arts in 1880, studying under Falguière. Later, he also received instruction from Dalou and Rodin. Finally, he joined Rodin's studio and was deeply cared for. He spent fifteen years immersed in study in Rodin's studio.</p>
<p>When emerging art was blooming like a riot of flowers, Bourdelle silently explored its mysteries. Rodin passed on to him both "strength" and "grandeur." When this master was enjoying fame, he had already fulfilled his master's expectations, nurturing the essence of his art and thought.</p>
<p>The more intense and lasting the personality of Rodin's works, the more multifaceted the development of Bourdelle's works becomes, and the more obvious the contradictions and conflicts in their works become. Rodin's work is a grand and magnificent expression of a unified soul, absolutely personal. Bourdelle's work, however, is in a state of perpetual awakening and trepidation. Personality is much less prominent, but his more refined and emotional soul made him more susceptible to external influences. Several of his works, while not detracting from his value, are sufficient to remind us of the two most glorious periods in the history of sculpture, namely the ancient and oriental periods. Bourdelle did not hesitate to draw inspiration from them. On the other hand, his works are also bridges between the Impressionist and Architectural schools. His early work "Archer" (Heracles Archer), housed in the Luxembourg Museum in Paris, belongs to Impressionism. It is a muscular dynamism and a product of Arabian-style rhythm and taste. Conversely, his mature works, especially "La Vierge Alsace," have transcended into the moving realm of architectural sculpture.</p>
<p>As we observe his art more closely, we can see that Rodin laid a foundation for him, extracting its essence and discarding its dross. His tendency to transcend into architecture is precisely to avoid the decadent pathology of Impressionism, a weakness shared by Rodin and many of his disciples.</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>The Sycee Price is Prosperous</p>
<p>Market Overview: In the recent market, foreign exchange transactions have been lively due to active buying and selling by banks, enhancing the overall situation. However, weak sales to customers have been a drawback. Currently, banks are busiest with purchases by the Central Bank and the Bank of China. Supply is mainly from Shanghai, with occasional transactions occurring. In general, there is no possibility of significant changes in the silver market. Although discount bills have become more common, they cannot compete with the abundance of cash.</p>
<p>Sycee Discount Rates: In the morning market, the sycee price rose due to slightly stronger buying interest, resulting in a quoted price of 72 cents, a rise of 3.75 hao compared to the previous day, showing a promising trend. The silver discount rate remained sluggish as before, with no interest on overnight loans. Floating interest rates and overnight bank rates were not priced.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: There are many Jiangnan small silver coins currently in the market. However, small firms are competing with each other, not yet reaching the point of a sharp decline. Yesterday's price was 62 cents 3 li, a decrease of 0.45 li compared to the previous day, and the situation is quite sluggish. Transactions amounted to 15,000 jiao. Guangdong small silver coins also rose by 0.75 li yesterday, to 59 cents 8.75 li, with very high trading volume, totaling 225,000 jiao. It is heard that both Jiangnan and Guangdong small silver coins have large distribution networks, so the market is quite brisk. Copper coins suddenly decreased by 4,500 cash, to 398,000 cash.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: (Silver Funds) Yesterday, bank receipts were not very complicated. Chinese merchants' receipts were over 1.5 million, foreign merchants over 1 million, and various remittance taxes, miscellaneous electricity deposits, etc., totaled about 7 million. Silk exports were over 300,000, with 700,000 leaving the warehouse. Japanese banks received over 2 million and released 400,000 from the warehouse. Money shops and silver firms received over 23 million, with over 2.6 million in floating interest. Remittances from various routes were over 600,000, with cash receipts of slightly over 1 million. (Silver Dollars) Remittances in the morning market amounted to 890,000, with 20,000 in banknotes. Over-the-counter banknotes were 143,000, bank interbank transactions were 850,000, and various banks' silver accounts were received at over 900,000, with banknote inflows and outflows of over 1 million. Silver receipts from money shops with floating interest totaled over 800,000, interbank borrowing of silver dollars was over 1.2 million, and interbank transactions by money shops totaled over 2.5 million, with interbank transactions by small money shops over 500,000.</p>
<h3>Reaction After Frequent Gold Standard Hikes</h3>
<p>Market Disrupted by Prior Increases and Subsequent Declines: Yesterday, the gold standard suddenly weakened. However, with prior increases and subsequent declines, there were differences of about 7 taels throughout the day, and the market situation was erratic. Transactions among traders were unusually swift, but psychological factors differed, leading to varying entry and exit points. Hengxing, Shengda, Taixing, etc., were buyers, while Fuchang, Yuanheng, Yu Da, Zhifengyong, Shunli, Wanxing, etc., tended to sell. Yongshengchang, Yuancheng Yong, etc., sold first and then bought. The current gold standard was purchased successively by the Datong Bank. Foreign exchange quotations have narrowed by one grade, but the domestic market rebounded and then weakened. Operators sold after initially accumulating positions. In the morning, due to further tightening, the opening price was high, with an increase of 3 taels. However, there was a fluctuation of over 1 tael, and then sellers became active, and the exchange rate eased, resulting in a steep decline of 4 taels, from 494 taels 6 qian to 90 taels 0.5 qian. The recent settlement price for British gold was 1 shilling 11 pence 625, and for Japanese gold, 1 tael 0.2625. Subsequently, the market initially stabilized, but due to reports of rising Indian exchange rates, sellers remained active, and the market weakened, declining sharply by 4 taels. Then, due to banks buying exchange bills and Datong absorbing cash, prices rebounded by 2 taels. However, with unsettled sentiment, there was a slight decline of 1 tael at the end, between 89 taels.</p>
<p>Further Tightening Led to Higher Opening: The London silver bar prices have shrunk by one-eighth, the silver price has been reduced by a quarter, and the exchange rate has risen by one-sixteenth. The opening price for the April gold standard increased by 1 tael 8 qian, totaling 493 taels 5 qian. Subsequently, it decreased from 3 taels 8 qian to 2 taels 7 qian, and then increased to 4 taels 4 qian. When the shilling opened, it was 93 taels 6 qian, the exchange rate has shrunk by 25, the US dollar shrunk by 5 jiao, and the Japanese gold increased by 1.125 fen, rising to 94 taels 6 qian. Domestic gold also firmed up. The British broker McCall absorbed March gold at 11 pence 5625, and Citibank and Zhengjin sold June gold at 11 pence 625. HSBC released April US dollars at 47.75. At 10 o'clock, the market seemed to soften, falling by over 1 tael. Taiwan released US dollars at 47.875 and March British gold at 11 pence 625. Mitsui and Sumitomo released May gold at 11 pence 6875, and Japanese gold also fell. Zhejiang released June gold at 1 tael 0.25, Shanghai bought at 1 tael 0.2375, so the gold price continued to weaken. Wanxing, Shunli, Yuanheng, and others were keen to sell, reaching only 90 taels 0.5 qian by noon. In an instant, it turned up a few qian, with Chenfengyong and others buying in, closing at 91 taels 2 qian.</p>
<p>Closing Down Slightly by 2 Taels 8 Qian: In the afternoon market, the opening price was 91 taels 6 qian. After that, due to the sharp rise in Indian exchange rates, people were very afraid, and the price plummeted, only reaching 88 taels. Exchange bills were also relaxed. Mitsui released June gold at 11 pence 8125, and the sellers on the floor were active. At 2:30, it rebounded by 1 tael 0, reaching 89 taels 2 qian. Suddenly, it fell again to 88 taels. Subsequently, it was heard that Datong bought cash, and people's hearts were lifted. At 3 o'clock, it rebounded to 89 taels 2 qian. However, there were continuous sellers, and the exchange bills were not good. Zhengjin bought Japanese gold at 1 tael 0.19375, and the bank bought April British gold at 11 pence 8125, June at 875. Therefore, at 3:30, it finally fell to 87 taels 8 qian. Later, Taiwan absorbed, Japanese gold at 1 tael 0.2, Mitsui bought at 1 tael 0.2125, so it immediately turned mild, rising by 2 taels, to 89 taels 9 qian. After 4 o'clock, there were slight sellers, suppressing it again by slightly over 1 tael, totaling 88 taels 45 qian. In short, people's hearts were restless, leading to a chaotic and uncertain market price. The closing price at 4:30 was 488 taels 9 qian, a decrease of 2 taels 8 qian compared to the previous day, which is indeed the reaction after successive increases.</p>
<p>Final Quote Down by 15-16 Taels: The maximum price for the day was 94 taels 6 qian, and the minimum price was 87 taels 8 qian, a difference of 6 taels 8 qian. The quoted price has been changed to 504 taels, due to the Japanese gold increasing by 1.125 fen. Initially, it was reduced by slightly less than 10 taels, and at noon, it was suppressed by slightly less than 12-13 taels, recorded as 91 taels for February and April, 90 taels for March, and the surcharge was 91 taels. In the afternoon, the surcharge was 89 taels. The quoted price was suppressed by slightly over 15-16 taels. The opening price for goods in the morning was 93 taels 8 qian, the noon closing price was 1 tael 5 qian, the afternoon was 2 taels 1 qian, and the closing price was 89 taels 1 qian.</p>
<p>Dalian Traders Were Very Active: Various firms' transactions included Taixing, Yuan Maoyong, Tianxiang, and Chenfengyong all buying in, with Hengxing and Shengda buying in several hundred taels, and adding to their long positions. Wanxing, Shunli, Fuchang, Yuanxingyong, Zhifengyong, Yuancheng Yong, Yuantai, Yu Da, Fuxingyong, etc., were all selling. Dalian traders sold off around 2,000 taels and bought in about 1,000 taels. In the afternoon, various firms' buying and selling included Yu Da, Yuan Maoyong, Yuanheng, Fuxingyong, Wanxing, Shunli, etc., all selling, while Chenfengyong, Hengxing, Taixing, Yongchengchang, Yuancheng Yong, etc., all buying. Yuantai, Yichang, and Yu Yu had mixed positions. Dalian traders had a total of 3,000 taels of activity, with buying and selling breaking even.</p>

The futures market remained calm, and market trading was slow. The morning market traded 2.9 million yuan, and the afternoon market traded just over 1.8 million yuan, for a total of 4.8 million yuan.

Except for the Seventh Year, 96, and Financial bonds, which were still rarely fluctuating, the other bonds continued to fall by about 0.3-0.4 yuan.</p>

<p>Difficult to Expect a Revival in the Yarn Market</p>
<p>The yarn market remains depressed, and most people are bearish, because the base stocks are gradually increasing, sales are not smooth, and the political situation is turbulent. Outsiders are scrambling to short sell, so the market is currently under extreme pressure from the sellers. The yarn market is still volatile. However, the amount purchased by a certain manufacturer remains stable. The price for this month is lower than the current yarn price. If actual sales remain sluggish, the future will be difficult to stabilize.</p>
<p>Auctioned Yarn Short Selling Continues to Weaken: The human auction market opened in the morning, and because of the large decline the previous day, it rebounded as those who profited covered their positions. Each month rose by 0.03-0.04 yuan. In the second session, due to the depression of flower prices, a panic arose again, and market prices plummeted by 0.06-0.07 yuan. In the third session, No. 68 heavily covered their short positions, and the closing price rebounded by 0.06-0.07 yuan. As a result, each month rose by 0.01-0.03 yuan. In the afternoon, the market suddenly fell by 0.03-0.04 yuan. In the second and third sessions, sellers were relatively scarce, and the market atmosphere stabilized slightly. Each month rebounded by 0.03, 0.04, and 0.06 yuan. It was found that No. 66 was the most active seller, with approximately 3,000-4,000 bales traded in the morning and afternoon markets. The total daily transaction volume was 22,800 bales. The closing prices of the human auction market are recorded below:</p>
<p>Human Auction Closing Prices (Change) | Inventory | May | 15.32 | : : | 24,650</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>February | 15.65 | Up 0.07 | 31,300 | June | 15.32 | Down | 118,200</p>
<p>March | 15.45 | Up 0.06 | 40,950 | July | 15.31 | Up 0.03 | 11,500</p>
<p>April | 15.37 | Up 0.02 | 39,400</p>
<p>Actual Yarn Sales Remain Weak: Various gangs bought 880 bales, while traders within the same trade bought 1,200 bales. The market situation was similar to the previous day. Among the out-of-town customers, the Sichuan gang had the strongest buying power, accounting for 235 bales. In addition, the Niuzhuang gang bought 215 bales, Luzhou bought 190 bales, Jiangxi bought 35 bales, Shashi bought 25 bales, Wuhu bought 25 bales, Hong Kong bought 50 bales, the mainland bought 55 bales, and miscellaneous gangs bought 50 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Still Shows No Improvement</h3>
<p>The cotton market is calm, but the situation is still weak, because the overseas cotton market is softening, with no major changes. Various factories have sold off a lot of foreign cotton. At this time, there is really no way to deal with domestic cotton, so actual business is also slow. Therefore, people are bearish, but it is difficult for Hankou market prices to loosen significantly.</p>
<p>Hankou Auctioned Cotton Falls First and Then Recovers: The market opened flat in the morning. As the auction progressed to more distant months, it gradually felt weaker. Fell 0.01 yuan. In the second and third sessions, the yarn market was not good, and selling became intense. Each month fell another 0.01-0.02 yuan. There were more people covering their short positions at the close, and it rebounded by 0.005 yuan. The market stabilized in the afternoon, rising from 0.005 to 0.01 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 38,800 piculs. The closing prices of the Hankou auctioned cotton are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hankou Cotton | Closing (Change) | Inventory | Closing (Change) | Inventory</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>February | 34.95 | Up 0.10 | 31,400 | May | 34.20 | Up 0.05 | 67,500</p>
<p>March | 34.35 | Up 0.05 | 64,000 | June | 34.20 | : : | 51,7000</p>
<p>April | 34.20 | Up 0.10 | 86,100 | July | 34.30 | Up 0.10 | 31,700</p>
<p>Spot Transactions Halted: Spot cotton business is deserted, and various factories have no intention to trade. There is no source of supply on the wharves. 2,000 bales of Yao cotton were sold at a price of 34 taels. Xin San Factory bought them, and the spot goods were sent to the factory.</p>
<h3>Overseas Yarn and Cotton Show Mixed Fluctuations</h3>
<p>British and Indian Cotton Report Declines: Yesterday, US cotton initially weakened due to mass selling, but then strengthened due to short covering and buying from the west. Futures rose by 1-6 points, and spot prices were unchanged. British cotton futures fell by 14 points, and spot prices fell by 11 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices were unchanged. Indian cotton weakened due to small declines in US cotton and a market sentiment leaning towards selling. Pingguol fell by 5 rupees, and far-term contracts fell by 4-5 rupees. Aomula fell by 6 rupees, and far-term contracts fell by 6-7 rupees. Bairuoxi fell by 6 rupees, and far-term contracts fell by 7 rupees. The telegram is recorded on the left.

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Rice Market Flat and Weak</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, more than 30 ships arrived from various gangs, and sales were sluggish.</p>
<p>Northern Japonica rice buyers are not moving because the sellers are unwilling to reduce prices. Therefore, the total number of bushels traded throughout the day decreased. Only half-laden ships with poor quality cargo were forced to cut prices by 0.5 to 0.1 yuan because sellers wanted to quickly liquidate their positions. Few people bought thin paddy rice. Yangdu Xian rice from good locations was very stable, and the sales were very good, in addition, the inventory in the interior was insufficient, and people were optimistic. The overall market was stable because Japonica and thin paddy rice were poor. Very few Xiang rice shipments arrived from other ports, and transportation was not very smooth. Therefore, retail sales turned to foreign rice, and prices were neither good nor bad. The buying interest in white yuan rice was calm, and the trend was not strong. The market was barely maintaining its original level.</p>
<p>Shanghai South: River shipments increased, and sales in the district were slightly weak. Changshu and Xishui Northern Japonica rice prices were stable, but the supply of Suzhou and Tongji machine-milled rice was scarce and remained firm. The sales volume of each store seemed to be worse than the previous day, and the market lacked any fluctuations. The sales of thin early rice from the southern gangs were stagnant and weak. Although a small number of restaurants slightly increased their purchases, they were only retail sales, and restaurant sales were flat. The customer gangs were still very active for Yangdu Xian rice, and shipments were not strong, and prices were tight. For Bian Yin Yuan rice, the district selects high-quality rice, and the market is stable.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Gang Purchases Small Crushed Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, only small crushed rice was available in the foreign rice market, and because the supply and inventory were both abundant, the market remained weak. Suddenly, the Wenzhou gang arrived at the market and purchased actively, and the market immediately became active. If they continue to purchase today and tomorrow, the market price may also rise. The total market sales of small crushed rice were nearly 10,000 bags, priced at 13.5 to 13.3 yuan. Except for this district, all were purchased by the Wenzhou gang and Taizhou, etc. There were more Saigon futures available, and prices were also uniquely advantageous.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Opens and Falls Repeatedly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices for all months continued to fall due to lower quoted prices for foreign wheat (Chicago fell by about 0.4 yuan, and Canada fell by about 0.8 yuan). Therefore, market sentiment was exceptionally weak for both near-term and far-term contracts, and prices opened and fell repeatedly. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the decline in prices for all months was even worse than in the morning. Although the large mills did not sell off much, the small mills offered more supplies, and most speculators also softened and sold aggressively. Since last winter, the market has been rising, partly due to the emptiness of wheat stocks, but partly due to the support of market sentiment. The observation of this kind of liquidity is that when prices are expected to rise, everyone competes to buy, and when prices are expected to fall, everyone sells. The situation cannot be fully assessed based on facts alone. According to this situation, it is expected that the market will eventually fall to a level that attracts actual sales, or there may be a chance for stabilization. If both sides are only relying on empty speculation, then the short sellers may have a slight advantage. As a result, the current month fell by a huge 0.0275 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. March fell by 0.03 yuan, April fell by 0.0175 yuan, May fell by 0.0225 yuan, and June and July each fell by 0.0125 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Fall Sharply Across the Board</h3>
<p>Spot Prices Reduced by a Huge 0.02 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat futures market opened in the morning and afternoon, prices for all months fell sharply across the board due to continued low quoted prices for foreign wheat and weak market sentiment. The arrival of spot wheat has been smooth, and the saying "goods are expensive and customers travel far" means there is no worry about the market not being full. Furthermore, the flour market has been falling sharply for a week, either falling by 0.01 yuan or more than 0.01 yuan. The wheat market has no choice but to follow suit. In short, the rise and fall of the market must depend on the environment. If it is stubbornly held up independently, it may be beyond anyone's ability. As a result, the current month fell by a huge 0.06 yuan compared to the previous day. March and April each fell by 0.03 yuan, June fell by 0.01 yuan, and July was unchanged. The spot wheat market opened sharply lower yesterday, with the opening price falling by a huge 0.02 yuan compared to the highest opening price. Because factories have reached this stage, they are not only raising the killing price, but also lowering the price as much as possible. Kainan wheat from Suqian opened at 5.117 yuan, and Yaowan wheat opened at 5.117 yuan, for a total of 8,000 bags. Xinda bought more than 6,000 bags, and Fuxin bought the rest.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods</h3>
<p>Vegetarian Vermicelli Continues to Soar</p>
<p>Over 300 Bags Were Sold Yesterday and Were Extremely Popular</p>
<p>Since the recent increase in vegetarian vermicelli prices, the market inventory has been very thin, and the market is very popular. According to reports from Shantou, the place of origin, the existing inventory has been searched and purchased by the Wenzhou and Taizhou gangs, so the shipments to Shanghai are even scarcer, and the prices have suddenly increased. Over 300 bags were sold yesterday, all of which were Tongshou goods. The prices of brands such as Yuan Tai and Yi Xing were 7.6 to 7.7 yuan, which was 0.05 yuan higher than the previous session, and the trend was extremely strong. The other brands, such as Yuan He, Hong Fa, and Zhong Shun, did not have any goods to sell. This is the reason for the soaring market.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>No. 2 White Lead Sheet is Extremely Quiet, But Ready to Move</p>
<p>No. 2 white lead sheet is a necessary item for the tea gangs, and sales are bound to be strong every spring. Due to the war and bandit disasters in the foreign provinces, transportation is unfavorable, and actions have been delayed. Therefore, it was only yesterday that a few companies such as XXX started trading, opening 60-70 barrels at a price of 24.5 taels, which was 0.05 taels higher than the red disk. However, the situation after this may be extremely quiet, but ready to move. In general, the work of firework factories will also start, and the trends of other colors from No. 3 to No. 12 are excellent. For example, there are many discussions between various gangs about No. 5 and No. 9, so the opening prices are also quite impressive. It is estimated that No. 5 is 22.225 taels, and No. 9 is 21.225 taels. In addition, the market is very quiet due to the small number of transactions for various other colors.</p>

<h3>The National Goods Factory Association Petitions the Government to Substantially Assist the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai National Goods Factory Association sent telegrams to Chairman Jiang, President Tan, and Ministers Kong and Song, stating: The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, a member of our association, has strong capital and a large scale. Its products are sold throughout the country, making it a giant in China's tobacco industry. Recovering its rights and interests is of great significance. Recently, due to years of losses, it has announced its closure. The reasons for this are several: First, the tobacco tax is too high, making it difficult to compete with foreign goods. Second, labor unrest has occurred repeatedly, gradually increasing expenses. Third, the situation is unstable, and business is declining daily. Fourth, the soaring gold price has greatly affected the import of goods. As a result, the only deeply rooted factory cannot be maintained. Thinking of this is very painful. The above-mentioned difficulties cannot be overcome by the company itself, and all depend on the government to find ways to resolve them. Since the company's closure, thousands of workers have suddenly lost their jobs and have nowhere to be placed. The government should consider the company's plight of having no choice but to close and find ways to remedy the situation, reduce taxes and duties, provide convenience to Chinese merchants, and prevent foreign merchants from gaining control. Labor unrest should be eliminated, and labor and capital should work together to avoid workers constantly making excessive demands. If this can be done, the obstacles will be removed, and capitalists will dare to invest. Otherwise, the announcement of closure may not be limited to the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company alone. Our association, being a national goods factory group, cannot remain silent when witnessing a company capable of competing with foreign goods being hit by various blows and closing down. Therefore, we dare to detail the company's plight of having no choice but to close and respectfully request that your Excellency consider the reasons why the company cannot stand firm and provide substantial support to maintain its continued operation, so that workers can avoid losing their jobs. The telegram cannot express our utmost anticipation. Standing Committee Members of the Shanghai National Goods Factory Association: Lu Xingzhuang, Zhang Bingsen, Shen Mengshi, Xu Jianfan, Ma Jisheng, Ma Kou.</p>

I telegraphed a report on the matter on the [blank] day.

The bandits fled to the mountains. The warship is now sailing to the Daishan fishing area. Please forward a telegram to avoid misunderstandings, etc. I have already sent telegrams instructing them to report the situation in detail and investigate thoroughly. A separate document will be submitted for review.

<h3>The County Finance Bureau Urges Farmers to Register Land</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Finance Bureau has been ordered to carry out land registration and has already organized a registration office in the bureau, which began operations on February 10th. Now, Director Li of the bureau believes that the farmers in various villages have not been enthusiastic in following the instructions to apply for registration in recent days, fearing that they have not been fully informed or are waiting to see what happens. Therefore, he has specially ordered the tax collection officials in each district to instruct the local heads to inform the farmers in each area to quickly comply with the registration. It should be known that this land registration is being carried out to protect farmers' property rights, so please do not misunderstand yourselves, etc.</p>
<h3>The County Government Forbids Landlords from Collecting "Lease Regulations"</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government issued a notice yesterday, stating: According to the report submitted by Ren Yonglian, the head of the Fifth District, the following was received from the County Government's instructions: "It was ordered by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines that due to frequent disasters and reduced harvests last year, the departments of civil affairs and finance have investigated and verified the components, and farmers have mostly agreed to reduce the rent payable, originally for the sake of taking care of tenant farmers. Recently, various counties have reported that tenant farmers often use disasters as an excuse to look at each other and jointly resist paying rent, which not only affects the rent payable but also affects local security. The county should investigate the circumstances of tenant farmers paying rent, the reasons for resisting rent, whether there are any bad elements inciting them, and implement appropriate measures to provide relief and curb chaos, etc." I have received this order and ordered the district head to immediately comply with the investigation and report to be forwarded for verification. In addition, I have found that the autumn harvest in my district last year was less than before, and the rent was set according to the previous example. Tenant farmers can still pay the rent on time, but the lease regulations are harsh, and tenant farmers cannot bear the burden. I should strictly prohibit and ban them to alleviate the people's difficulties. This lease regulation originated in Nanyi. Landlords saw that huge profits could be made, regardless of the people's difficulties, and took the opportunity to increase it. For example, if a tenant farmer leases one mu of land, he must first pay a lease regulation fee of 20 yuan. After five or six years, when the lease expires, the item will be confiscated, which is harmful and unprofitable to the tenant farmers' livelihood. Therefore, I request that it be strictly prohibited as soon as possible, which is beneficial to both public morality and the people's livelihood, etc." According to this, in addition to instructing the report to be sent for forwarding, since the lease regulations are harsh and harmful to the farmers, and only this district has this harsh regulation, it should be prohibited immediately. Now, a notice is issued, and a notice is collected and posted.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>This order is issued and announced for all business tenants to comply with. It is known that the land is not the entire territory of this county, and it is harmful to farmers and tenants, so it should be abolished uniformly. Everyone should abide by it. This notice is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs is Planning to Compile the New Almanac for Next Year</h3>
<p>The Central Government's Criticism of This Year's New Almanac</p>
<p>The new almanac for the 19th year of the Republic of China, compiled by the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, was sent to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education by the Municipal Government for record, and because in the 18th year, old almanacs, neither new nor old, were still popular everywhere, hindering the promotion of the national calendar, the 20th year almanac should be planned early, so that all bookshops can print according to the format. However, the two ministries previously attached and printed the "National Almanac" method. Should this city continue to compile it according to the format, and should local customs, government orders, and regulations be included as appropriate, and how should they be specified? The matter is important. Please ask the two ministries to review and reply so that we can start preparing. It is now heard that the Municipal Government has approved the reply from the two ministries, roughly stating: "It has been approved that your special Municipal Government has sent the new almanac for the 19th year of the Republic of China compiled by the Bureau of Social Affairs, asking for it to be recorded, and that the 20th year almanac should include local customs, government orders, and regulations as appropriate, and asking how they should be specified, etc. This is approved. Now, after reviewing the original book in detail, we believe that there are several points that need to be studied: (1) The brief table of revolutionary memorial days and the memorial ceremony for revolutionary memorial days should be printed in the almanac, calendar, or diary to promote propaganda. Last year, the Executive Yuan ordered the department to implement it, and the贵 Municipal Government was already consulted to inform them of this matter. The list of revolutionary memorial days in the original book, which combines the memorial ceremony and the brief table into one table, is very concise. However, if the historical outline and propaganda points in the full text of the memorial ceremony are also included, it will be more convenient for societies and institutions to follow. It should be completely added in the second edition or the next edition. (2) The vegetable monthly order chart and the insect-removing monthly order chart in the original book are indeed practical, but the size is too small and difficult to identify. It should be enlarged appropriately or the printing improved to make it easier to read. The above points should be followed by the bureau to increase the effectiveness of the original book. The content of the book is rich and the materials are appropriate, so it should be approved for record. Also, the interim measures for imitating and printing the National Almanac, which were promulgated last year, originally only applied to the National Almanac issued by the two ministries. As for the almanacs issued by various institutions or merchants, after being reviewed by the local competent authority, as long as they do not conflict with the laws and regulations promoting the national calendar and abolishing the lunar calendar, there is no need to restrict the inclusion of local customs, government orders, and regulations, as well as general knowledge or specialized theories. The two ministries have consulted and have the same opinion. We hereby consult and reply together, and we hope that you will check and follow this order." The Municipal Government has ordered the Bureau of Social Affairs to inform them. It is heard that the bureau has already started collecting materials and is compiling the new almanac for next year, which should be more complete than this year's.</p>
<h3>Duplex System for Radio</h3>
<p>From Telegram to Delivery in Less Than Ten Minutes</p>
<p>After the Shanghai stations of the Radio Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation added new machines and implemented the duplex system, simultaneous transmission and reception became extremely fast, more than a hundred times faster than before. For example, for commercial telegrams to and from Guangzhou, Hankou, and other ports, the time from telegram to delivery averages less than ten minutes. The news and banking sectors in Shanghai all believe that this achievement of the bureau has opened a new era in the telecommunications industry. The accuracy and speed of the bureau's international station communicating with various parts of Europe are also the same, so many foreign merchants also enjoy using it.</p>
<h3>Definite Date for the Arrival of the International Opium Investigation Team in Shanghai</h3>

According to reliable sources yesterday, the entire team is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the "Changsha Maru" mail ship on March 2nd to investigate the current state of opium sales, transportation, and the number of smokers in this city, in preparation for reporting to the League of Nations.</p>
<h3>Zhao Binghe Fraudulently Obtains Gun Transportation Permit</h3>
<p>Garrison Command Detains for Interrogation</p>
<p>Zhao Binghe, the Chinese manager of the Austrian-owned Ying Liqiu Steel Factory in Shanghai, has been detained by the Songhu Garrison Command for fraudulently obtaining a gun transportation permit and is awaiting interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Reason for Leng Jun Dismissing Cheng Lin</h3>
<p>The dismissal of Cheng Lin, the chief of the First Public Security Bureau of Shanghai, due to the case, and the sections of the district that have petitioned for his retention, have been previously reported. Recently, it has been learned that County Chief Leng has replied to the telegrams from Jin Zuobin, Chen Lujun, Zhu Jichen, and others, stating: (Titles omitted) "Your telegram has been received and carefully read. I respectfully acknowledge your upright words. I, Jun, cannot help but speak, and I hereby briefly state it. I, Jun, have been entrusted with the county seal for more than a month. At the beginning of my appointment, I embraced the ambition of clarifying official governance and strictly prohibiting both opium and gambling. To perfunctorily compromise is not only what a revolutionary party member cannot bear to do but also what would be a betrayal of the earnest expectations of all the elders and brothers of our county for good governance. Cheng Lin has been in office for a long time and has his own corresponding history. However, the only responsibility of the Public Security Bureau is to protect the local area and prohibit opium and gambling. What are the results in the Minhang District? The gentlemen have heard and witnessed it, and I believe you have a definite evaluation in your conscience. The exposure of the facts of the Wan Changheng gambling case makes it even more difficult to deny. The gentlemen are petitioning for retention, saying it is to maintain local stability. My, Jun's, dismissal is precisely for the benefit of the local area. The purpose is the same, and the retention or dismissal forms a trivial issue, so there is no need to be alienated. Furthermore, this time, the dismissal of Cheng Lin and the temporary appointment of Xu Baiyi are of a temporary and transitional nature. At the same time, the provincial department has been requested to review and commission him. There is no conflict with the regulations of the department's orders to various counties that they must not arbitrarily dismiss and commission the chiefs of public security bureaus. I am extremely grateful for your corrections and encourage me to do my best in my duties and I am unable to comply with your request. I hope that you will understand this. This is my reply. Leng Jun, County Chief of Shanghai County, signed."</p>
<h3>The Attitude of the Japanese After the Reorganization of the Provisional Court</h3>
<p>Japanese Deputy Envoy Says Japan Will Not Sign and Is Not Bound</p>
<p>The new agreement for the Shanghai Provisional Court has been signed by representatives of various countries and officially announced, scheduled to take effect on April 1st. However, because Japan is an uncontracted country, it did not participate in this meeting, and the new agreement was not signed. What are their opinions? It is quite noteworthy. Yesterday, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency specifically went to the Japanese Deputy Envoy, Shigeki Mamoru. According to what he said, "Japan has not signed the Shanghai Provisional Court reorganization agreement, so Japan is not bound by the new agreement. Japan still maintains its previous attitude and continues to negotiate with China. The original claims have not changed. Before April 1st, this issue will be negotiated together with other issues, and there may be a solution. Otherwise, after April 1st, litigation cases involving Japanese and other uncontracted country citizens will definitely be thorny."</p>
<h3>Proposals of the Municipal Council Police Department</h3>
<p>When the Municipal Council Police Department Committee met on February 7th, the chief accountant of the Municipal Council attended the meeting and stated that due to the strange contraction of foreign exchange, the budget for the purchase of bullets by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps this year must be increased by 10,000 taels. This was approved at the meeting. In addition, 28,000 taels for corps members' clothing expenses were also approved. As for fire-fighting, a portion of the construction costs of the West Suzhou Road Fire Station, amounting to 150,000 taels, was approved. It is heard that the station will be constructed soon. The construction cost of the new headquarters of the Fire General Association was also approved for 50,000 taels. The headquarters will be built next to the General Police Station. Also, 52,000 taels for the dormitory and wall of the Jing'an Temple Road Fire Station were also approved. As for the police station, 50,000 taels for a portion of the construction costs of the General Police Station were approved, and 50,000 taels for the construction costs of the new South Police Station were also approved. In addition, two budget papers worth 200,000 taels approved last year to cover the aforementioned expenses, 160,000 taels in remaining funds for the Japanese police dormitory in the Hongkou Police Station, 150,000 taels for the Carter Road patrol police dormitory, 150,000 taels for the police station hospital, and 300,000 taels for the Chinese police dormitory were also approved. As for the police station's administrative expenses, they were approved after the total was passed than last year, and the budget was still to be added. Also, if the armed reserve force is approved by the board of directors, the police station's administrative expenses will need to be further increased by 3 million taels.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau Urges the Addition of New High-Voltage Power Lines in the West District</h3>
<p>The new west district of this city is vast, with numerous institutions and many factories. However, there is only one high-voltage power line, starting from the corner of Jumen Road and Xietu Road to the Longhua Garrison Command. Once a line failure occurs, the entire area loses power. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, recognizing this, planned to add a high-voltage line to make the new west district a circular route. Even if there is a failure, the power outage can be avoided, and even if there is a power outage, the scope can be reduced. Later, the China Merchants Electric Company planned to add a transformer substation at the intersection of Manufacturing Bureau Road and Longhua Road and lay underground cables from the power plant along Wangdao Road directly to the substation. It would then lay two high-voltage overhead lines from the substation, one to transformer substation No. 14 on Jumen Road and one to the new west district, directly to Jinji Road. Once the addition is completed, the existing 23-square-millimeter high-voltage line on Xietu Road will be replaced section by section with a thicker line for improvement. The bureau believed that since the company was willing to add a transformer substation, it would be properly handled, so it approved the plan. However, a long time has passed, and the company has not yet started construction. The bureau has ordered them to expedite construction and not delay the matter.</p>
<h3>Trade Association Has No Supervisory Committee</h3>
<p>Article 9 of the Trade Association Law for Industry and Commerce does not explicitly state that committee members are executive committee members or supervisory committee members. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for interpretation, which was forwarded by the Executive Yuan to the Judicial Yuan and sent to the Supreme Court. The proposed explanation stated roughly that Article 9 of the Trade Association Law for Industry and Commerce stipulates that trade associations shall have seven to five committee members, who shall elect standing committee members, etc. According to the provisions of Article 10 of the Judicial Law and Article 18, paragraph 2 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, they should be executive committee members, etc. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce believes that since the number of committee members in Article 9 of the Trade Association Law for Industry and Commerce has been interpreted as the nature of executive committee members, there is no need for trade associations to establish a supervisory committee. However, according to the employee registers reported by various associations recently, there are often still supervisory committee members listed, and even several supervisory committee members are added outside the statutory 15 people, which is inconsistent with laws and regulations. Therefore, the municipal government has been consulted and instructed to inform the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to comply, and the bureau has been correcting this from time to time after receiving the order.</p>

<h3>Results of the Bone Steaming Autopsy Case Yesterday</h3>
<p>Determined to be Death by Suicide</p>
<p>Family Still Claims Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>Both Parties Compete for Coffin</p>
<p>Hearing Required Again Today</p>
<p>Chen Sun, the daughter-in-law (formerly Sun Genbao) of Chen Shuangxi, a kingpin from Jiangbei who runs the Qinglian Pavilion teahouse in Suzhou's Changmen, is suspected of dying at home. The circumstances of the bone steaming autopsy ordered by the local court have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, both the plaintiff and the defendant reported to the autopsy site. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>All Skeletal Remains Were Washed First - Inspector Yang Wenjun, accompanied by autopsy examiners Shen Xiqing, Xuan Yifang, and Xuan Zhiming, arrived at the autopsy site. After unsealing the coffin, they proceeded to wash all the skeletal remains, completing the washing process around 12:00 PM at noon.</p>
<p>Skeletal Remains Steamed in Cage - The skeletal remains were then placed inside a steaming cage and steamed over water. Only a pot of clear water was placed in the steamer, with licorice and tea leaves added to prevent any tampering with the water. The remains were then steamed after being sprinkled with liquor. White cloth was spread inside the steaming cage, with a large amount of wine lees placed on top of the cloth. After an hour of steaming, more liquor was sprinkled, as liquor allows the heat to easily penetrate the bones.</p>
<p>Washing Again After Steaming - After steaming until 2:00 PM in the afternoon, the skeletal remains were removed and washed again thoroughly. The autopsy examiners then placed the skeletal remains on a mat, arranging them in a human form and examining them.</p>
<p>Red Coloration on Ear Root and Fingers - The autopsy findings were then announced publicly by Xuan Yifang, who stated that red coloration was discovered on the bone at the root of the left ear, red coloration on the left fingers, and lighter red coloration on the right fingers compared to the left fingers. The toes were clear white. The neck bone and skull bones showed no red coloration.</p>
<p>Blood Flows Downwards in Hanging - According to the findings, the rope loop of a suicide victim must be around the root of the ear bone. If the deceased's head was tilted to the left, the left ear bone would naturally bear the weight and be injured as a matter of course. Because the victim committed suicide due to chest suffocation, they naturally wanted to die, so the blood flowed downwards. The congealed blood then settled in the fingertips, causing them to turn red. If the hanging was prolonged, the blood would flow further downwards, and the congealed blood would then settle in the toes, causing the toes to turn red.</p>
<p>Broken Back of Neck with Strangulation - If the deceased was strangled, they would not have wanted to die but would have been forced by others. As a result of the compulsion, the deceased would naturally struggle before losing consciousness, and the perpetrator would tighten the noose. There would be marks around the first and second vertebrae of the neck bone, that is, the bone would show discoloration. The skin on the back of the neck would be broken by the rope due to the struggle. Now, a piece of skin from the back of the neck has been preserved and examined, and there is no sign of breakage. There is no doubt that it was death by hanging. Further, if the deceased had been tied up and strangled, they would not have been able to struggle, but since they did not want to die, the qi would have surged upwards, and the skull bone would have shown discoloration. This is a definite principle, and the neck bone must also be discolored. Now, the skull bone and the neck bone show no discoloration and are completely white and clean. Only the root of the left ear bone shows injury. Therefore, there is no doubt that it was death by hanging. Thus, the bone steaming autopsy that shocked Suzhou and Shanghai was determined to be death by hanging. All the skeletal remains were then ordered by Inspector Yang to be wrapped separately, stored in a large wooden box, and sealed all around in the warehouse for verification.</p>
<p>Deceased's Family Claims Dissatisfaction - Yang Jun then summoned the plaintiff Sun Zhengwen and the defendant Chen Xuebao to court for a preliminary hearing to inquire who would claim the coffin. However, both parties wanted to claim it. The official then ordered it to be temporarily stored in the Tongren Fuyuantang until the lawsuit was concluded, and then it would be disposed of. However, Sun Zhengwen still claimed to be dissatisfied. The official instructed that since the case was assigned by the High Court, any dissatisfaction should still be requested from the High Court. He also instructed both parties to come to the court again for questioning at 2:00 PM the next day (i.e., today).</p>
<p>Differences between Hanging and Strangling - The following is an excerpt from the "New Knowledge of Autopsy Examination" of the Jilin Autopsy Examination Institute, which is based on the examination. "Hanging and Strangling" states: Although both are a type of stopping breathing and severing nerves, the marks on the bones are very different. In all hanging victims, there are oblique blood-colored rope marks on the roots of both ears. Whether or not there are red blood marks on other brain bones, teeth, and fingertip bones depends on the position of the rope or the length of the hanging time. If the rope is above the throat, the teeth are clenched tightly, and qi and blood surge upwards, the brain bones and teeth will show red blood marks. If the rope is below the throat, the teeth are not tight, and qi and blood fall downwards, the brain bones and teeth will show no red blood marks. The blood marks on the fingertip bones appear if the hanging time is long, and not if it is short. If it is strangulation, the rope marks are mostly between the first and second cervical vertebrae, either flat or purplish red or purplish dark, which is darker than the color of hanging. The fontanelle bone protrudes slightly from the shell and is pale red or slightly blue. However, there are also those that become oblique. The wrist bones should have traces of rope binding. This is the distinction between hanging and strangulation.</p>
<h3>All Circles of Women Pay Attention to the Case of Killing Stepmother</h3>
<p>Provisional Court Continued Hearing Yesterday</p>
<p>Zhang Wenqing's Appearance is Only Average</p>
<p>Many Witnesses Arrived to Testify</p>
<p>Continued Hearing on the Seventh of Next Month</p>
<p>Zhang Wenqing, the 24-year-old unmarried daughter of the late Qing Dynasty magistrate Zhang Fusheng, conspired to seize the family property after becoming involved with Chen Hengcai, the son of a hired woman. She instigated Chen to gather accomplices and kill her stepmother, Zhang Su. After the incident, the criminals were arrested one by one, and the details of the interrogation have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper.</p>
<p>The Audience Was Very Crowded - Yesterday afternoon, the case was heard by Judge Luo Renji of the Provisional Court, who specially opened the Fifth Tribunal to continue the investigation. The women from all walks of life who attended the hearing were still very crowded.</p>
<p>Zhang Wenqing's Hair Was Cropped and Tousled - The defendant Zhang Wenqing, wearing a dark blue cheongsam, with her hair cropped and tousled, and of only average appearance, was escorted to the court by the women's detention center. The other three defendants, Chen Hengcai, Yao Legui, and Gao Jintang, were escorted by the police.</p>
<p>Lawyers on All Sides - At 2:30 PM, Judge Luo took the bench, with Mr. Menhart, the American Vice Consul specially appointed by the League, present as an observer. Zhang Wenqing had hired Wang Fuchang, Jiang Baoli, and Jiang Renfan, lawyers, to defend her. The family of the deceased also hired attorneys Zhu Yangu and others to appear in court and state their opinions.</p>
<p>Witnesses Summoned to Testify - The acting attorney for the police department, Ru Baoyi, first stood up and stated that the court had previously ordered the police department to investigate whether there were bloodstains and fingerprints on the back door of the deceased's residence at No. 762 Carter Road, and ordered Zhang Fusheng's wife Zhang Su, her second daughter Zhang Wenpei, her son-in-law Yin Rongyuan, and the witness Bai Wangshi to appear in court. Now, except for Bai Wangshi, all have complied with the summons.</p>
<p>Police Did Not Accuse Zhang Yin - However, the complaint filed by the deceased's younger brother Su Yaoting also listed Zhang Wenpei and Yin Rongyuan as defendants in this case. However, according to the police investigation, the two have no suspicion, so they were not accused together.</p>
<p>Two Suspicious Points for Zhang Yin - The lawyer for the family of the deceased immediately stood up and stated that Zhang and Yin had two suspicious points in this case. First, after the deceased was injured, Zhang Wenpei rushed to the Red Cross Hospital and learned that her sister had been detained, and made a big fuss, claiming that her sister must be returned. Second, after Zhang Su died, Zhang Wenpei took all the deceased's belongings away. The court should investigate these two points.</p>
<p>No Bloodstains or Fingerprints on Door - Then, the Western Detective Chief Mike Waylen reported on the investigation after the incident, stating that when the Chinese and Western detectives arrived at the Zhang's house, they saw many bloodstains in the living room, and the injured person was lying on the ground with knife wounds. The detectives then entered Chen Hengcai's and the servant's bedrooms and found that the room doors had been closed for a long time, dust had accumulated, and much of the paint on the doors had come off. There were no bloodstains and no obvious fingerprints. Even if the door had been pushed at the time, it looked as old and uneven, and no trace remained.</p>
<p>Bai Yushi Left Shanghai for Town - According to the police officer Ding Changyuan, he went to No. 111 Hengfeng Road, Zhabei, to summon Bai Wangshi. According to his family, he had left Shanghai for town a few days ago and did not know when he would return.</p>
<p>Zhang's Wife Narrated Family Situation - Zhang Fusheng's wife Zhang Su was then summoned. According to her, she was originally from Tianjin, 40 years old, and had two daughters, Zhang Wenqing, who was not yet married, and Zhang Wenpei, who had married Yin Rongyuan as his wife. My husband died ten years ago. Before his death, he served as a magistrate in the north and then entered the business world, serving as a comprador for the Hankou Lianhe Foreign Firm. Later, he retired and the family moved to Shanghai, and he took Su as his concubine, which has been thirteen years. The concubine gave birth to a son six months after entering the house, and he is now also thirteen years old.</p>
<p>The Lawsuit Against Each Other - My husband left ten thousand taels of property after his death, which was deposited in the bank. The passbook was kept in my custody. In September of the year before last, I lost my footing and fell, and became ill as a result. The concubine took the opportunity to take the passbook and other items away and never returned them. My eldest daughter, Wenqing, then informed the bank to stop payment. The concubine filed a lawsuit against my eldest daughter Wenqing and my second son-in-law Yin Rongyuan with the court because she could not withdraw the money. Later, she knew that she was wrong and sought reconciliation, but I also filed a lawsuit because she did not return the passbook and requested a judgment ordering the return of the property and the right to manage the household affairs. Later, we reconciled, and our relationship was restored, and our opinions were eliminated, with no grudges remaining.</p>
<p>The Murderer Had Already Fled When Going Downstairs - At the time of the incident, my eldest daughter Wenqing and I were upstairs. Then we heard the sound of tables and chairs moving downstairs, and Wenqing and I went downstairs and saw the concubine injured and lying on the ground. The murderer had already fled.</p>
<p>The Defendant's Testimony Was the Same as Last Time - The witness Duan Rongyuan claimed to work at the Maijia Li Bank and married Zhang Wenpei as his wife, and he and his wife testified to all the circumstances. Judge Luo presented the case and repeatedly interrogated the four defendants, Zhang Wenqing, and the others, for a long time. The testimony of Zhang and the others was generally similar to the testimony of the previous court hearing, so it will not be repeated.</p>
<p>Continued Hearing on March 7 - At the end, the lawyers of each party cross-examined the witnesses separately. It was already 6 o'clock, and the court ordered the defendants to be taken back into custody separately and rescheduled the hearing for the afternoon of March 7.</p>
<h3>Woman Singing Suzhou Ballads Accused of Seducing Married Man</h3>
<p>Wife Said Husband's Will Was Weak</p>
<p>Actually Hooked Up with Adultery</p>
<p>Lawyer's Complaint Had Errors</p>
<p>Voluntarily Withdrew Complaint in Court</p>
<p>Wang Caiyun, a woman singing Suzhou ballads at the Tianyun Building game field of Wing On Company, was accused by Ling Yuying, the wife of Ling Jinfu (also known as Cheng Jiahe), a Hangzhou native who worked at the Jiuda Silk Shop at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road, of having an affair with her husband. She specifically hired Lawyer Zhu to file a lawsuit with the Provisional Court for disrupting the family. The complaint stated that Wang Caiyun unlawfully seduced and broke up the couple, requesting that she be arrested and interrogated according to the law. It also stated that since the plaintiff and Ling Jinfu got married, their relationship was as close as glue. Unexpectedly, Wang Caiyun saw that Jinfu was young and could be deceived, and regardless of the fact that her lord and master had a wife, she dared to seduce him in every possible way, bewitching him and seizing his wealth. This adulterous Jinfu, with a weak will, fell for her tricks and put the plaintiff's life and family in a hopeless situation. Thinking about the plaintiff's family of several people, Ling Jinfu is the only one they rely on. Now, Wang Caiyun is so fierce and vicious that she has not only seized the husband on whom the plaintiff relied for survival but also destroyed the plaintiff's family and deprived the plaintiff of everything she owns. She is guilty of heinous crimes and should be thoroughly investigated. The case was heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Tan Xinzhen. The defendant Wang Caiyun hired Lawyer Jiang Yiping, and Ling Jinfu also hired a lawyer to defend him in court. First, the plaintiff Ling Yuying stated that she was 27 years old, originally from Wujiang, and currently resided at No. 1639 Xin Zha Road. Ling Jinfu is my husband. Since he met Wang Caiyun, he abandoned me. Last year, I filed a lawsuit with your court, and Wang and Ling were both found not guilty. Therefore, I specifically appealed, and as a result, we reconciled, and I withdrew the criminal suit. The reconciliation conditions stipulated that my husband would no longer go to Wang Caiyun's place in the future, but they were treated as nothing more than words, and he did not fulfill them. One day, I personally went to Wang Caiyun's house and caught Ling Jinfu, who was taken to the police station. This is all verifiable in the police records. Judge Tan, after reading the plaintiff's complaint in detail, found it difficult to understand. He then asked the plaintiff what crimes Wang and Ling were accused of. Ling Yuying replied that she was accusing Wang Caiyun of depriving a married man and accusing Ling Jinfu of abandoning his original wife. Judge Tan then asked the plaintiff's lawyer what crime Ling Jinfu was being prosecuted for. The lawyer replied that he was being accused of adultery. Judge Tan was quite surprised and said to the lawyer, "This judge just asked the plaintiff, who stated that she was accusing her husband of abandonment. However, your lawyer is saying that she is accusing him of adultery. As a lawyer, you should know that handling a case must be based on the intentions of the client. How can you arbitrarily change them? Your complaint focuses entirely on the first defendant, Wang Caiyun. The second defendant, Ling Jinfu, is not mentioned at all, and the accusation of disrupting the family is a type of complaint that does not exist in criminal law. It is quite bizarre. The plaintiff mentioned in the complaint that she had previously filed a lawsuit in this case. Fortunately, this judge carefully reviewed the case file and was able to understand the situation. However, how can a case be sued twice? Therefore, this case is difficult to establish." Ling Jinfu then stated that since the reconciliation of the appeal, he had been living with the plaintiff on Beijing Road. However, the plaintiff suddenly moved without telling him, so he did not know where she was. He is still willing to live with her. Wang Caiyun also stated that she had broken off relations with Ling Jinfu long ago. The plaintiff's claims are all untrue. The plaintiff's lawyer then requested to withdraw the complaint. The court granted the request and announced the adjournment. The bell had rung six times.</p>
<h3>Economic Hardship Suicide</h3>
<p>Too pitiful, the widow and orphans</p>
<p>Those who saw the coffin being laid out were heartbroken</p>
<p>Zhang Wenbing, a Ningbo native residing at No. 201, Yuezhou Road, Hongkou, swallowed a sedative potion the day before yesterday afternoon in an attempt to end his life. Around 9 p.m., he groaned from the poison taking effect. Only then did he confess to his wife, Zhang Chen. Mrs. Zhang was shocked upon hearing this and rushed Zhang to Tongren Hospital, but he died despite treatment. The hospital notified the Harbin Police Station in charge, which sent detectives to carry the body to the Filun Road morgue. The Provisional Court was notified, and Judge Wang Jianzu was commissioned to inspect the body at the morgue at 11 a.m. yesterday. After taking the bench, the head of the Western division of the Harbin Police Station, Mading, first reported the preliminary situation. Then, the deceased's wife, Zhang Chen, stated that her husband had been working on a ship for the China Merchants Bureau but had been laid off for quite some time. The cost of living was increasing daily, and the family of three children was struggling to make ends meet. He couldn't find work, causing him anxiety and leading him to take his own life. Judge Wang, upon hearing the report and confirming that the deceased had indeed taken poison due to financial difficulties, ordered the body to be released to Zhang Chen for burial. After Mrs. Zhang left, she carried one of her children, the eldest being only six or seven years old, and held the coffin, weeping inconsolably. Those who saw this were heartbroken.</p>
<h3>British Military Truck Kills Elderly Woman</h3>

<h3>Health Bureau Dispatches Personnel to Xinzhuang to Implement Epidemic Prevention Work</h3>
<p>Meningitis is prevalent in Xinzhuang Town, Songjiang County, and nearby villages. The Municipal Health Bureau previously sent personnel to investigate. It was reported in the previous edition that, in order to prevent the spread of meningitis, the bureau dispatched personnel to the town on the 20th to administer meningitis preventive vaccines. More than 400 residents and rural farmers arrived in the town, but due to the limited amount of medicine, only 250 people were vaccinated. It is said that the bureau will send personnel again on the 25th of this month to continue the vaccinations.</p>
<h3>Public Safety Bureau Improves Treatment of Detainees</h3>
<p>Director Yuan of the Municipal Public Safety Bureau believes that the long-term disrepair of the detention center has a significant impact on the hygiene of detainees. In addition to ordering the responsible Third Section to carry out major repairs, he also understands that the food for detainees is still following the old regulations from many years ago. Given the high cost of rice and firewood, appropriate improvements should be made to show compassion. He has increased the food allowance by three cents per person per day and added a serving of congee. Yesterday, he submitted a document to the Municipal Government, stating that: "Regarding the matter of reporting, it has been found that the bureau has a detention center for detaining individuals who have violated police regulations and criminals awaiting trial or interrogation. According to past records, the number of detainees often reaches over 200. Since taking office, the director has strictly ordered his subordinates to interrogate all cases, day and night, and to resolve and transfer them separately. The average daily number of detainees is still over 100. Most of these individuals are minor offenders. While strict control is necessary, treatment should also be generous. It has been found that the food allowance for each detainee is one dollar and two cents, with only two meals provided per day. It is now decided that from February 1st, the food allowance will be increased by three cents per detainee per day, with an additional serving of congee in the morning. This will increase the monthly food expenses by about 100 dollars. Although there are no earmarked funds, and due to budget limitations, we dare not request additional funds. We can only try to transfer funds from the bureau's expenses to save public funds. All reasons for increasing the food allowance for detainees in the bureau's detention center should be submitted for review and approval, as it is for the public good."</p>

<h3>Criminal Cases in the Public Concession in January</h3>
<p>According to the Police Department's report, there were a total of 1,717 criminal cases, large and small, in the Public Concession in January of this year, a decrease of 152 cases compared to December of last year. Cases of robbery with violence increased compared to the previous month, while cases of theft decreased. Among the major cases, there were four cases of assassination, five cases of attempted assassination, four cases of armed kidnapping, and a significant increase in cases of armed robbery, totaling 134. This is probably due to the Lunar New Year and the increasing number of unemployed people. The areas with the most cases were the districts under the jurisdiction of the General Police Station and the Old Gate Police Station, totaling 575 cases. The next most were the districts under the jurisdiction of the Hongkou, West Hongkou, and Dixiweier Road Police Stations, totaling 409 cases.</p>
<h3>Refund of Overpaid License Plate Fees for Cargo Ships</h3>
<p>Regulations stipulated by the Municipal Public Works Bureau</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau registers and inspects cargo ships, issuing license plates, edge-striped lamps, and wooden bases. The original deposit fee for each ship was four silver dollars. Later, the Municipal Government, out of consideration, reduced it to three silver dollars per ship, and instructed the bureau to refund the previously overcollected amount. It is now known that the bureau, in order to facilitate the refund of this overcollected license plate fee, has agreed with the Finance Bureau that shipowners who have already paid the old amount should, when paying taxes, be instructed by the Finance Bureau's Ship Tax Office to first go to the Ship Affairs Office of the Public Works Bureau to collect the overpaid amount with their license. After the Ship Affairs Office issues the refund, it will stamp the license for identification. During the monthly tax collection period, the Public Works Bureau will also send a police officer stationed at the Ship Affairs Office to be responsible for checking licenses and instructing the collection of overpaid amounts, to avoid omissions. This has already been reported to the Municipal Government for record.</p>

<h3>Electricity Users Should Not Resist Paying Electricity Bills</h3>
<p>Circular issued by the Municipal Public Safety Bureau: For compliance, it is approved that Public Works Bureau's letter No. 1861 states: "To whom it may concern, according to a submission from the Wusong Baoming Electric Company, the company previously received a letter from the Wusong Chamber of Commerce on January 24th, stating that the Wusong electricity users, Zhenhua Company, etc., requested a reduction in electricity charges, the same as the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant, etc. The company immediately responded truthfully, stating that since January of this year, the new regulations approved by the Municipal Government have been followed, and the meter limits have been reduced separately, and the connection fees have been cancelled. At present, it is really difficult to reduce electricity charges further, etc. After the reply was sent, a leaflet refusing to pay fees was suddenly discovered at the end of the month, which greatly affected the collection of fees this month. Recently, the so-called Wusong District Electricity Users Association and many slogans have been discovered. The company has repeatedly suffered from the impact of the current situation, poor business, and losses from electricity theft, resulting in significant losses. However, in January of the 18th year, the minimum limit of the meter was reduced by six degrees, and in June of the 18th year, the electricity charge was reduced from 25 cents to 23 cents. The new regulations approved by the Municipal Government have also been implemented, cancelling connection fees and reducing the minimum limit of the meter separately. The company asks itself, sincerely able to follow the regulations and strive to make the company and users achieve the principle of equality and strive for low prices, but such unfair events have occurred. If this continues, how can the business be imagined? It is reasonable to submit a document to the bureau chief for review, instructing compliance to maintain the business, which is in the public interest, etc. It has been found that electricity users should pay for the electricity they use. If the electricity users believe that the electricity price set by the electricity company is inappropriate, they should submit a written complaint to the competent authority. They should not refuse to pay electricity fees as a threat to achieve the purpose of reducing electricity prices. If such behavior is not stopped, it will have a great impact on the future of the city's electricity business. According to the above, in addition to instructing the company that it may first warn users who refuse to pay electricity fees according to regulations, and then stop supplying electricity if they still do not pay, we have also sent a letter to your bureau to instruct the district offices under its jurisdiction to severely stop any users who resist paying electricity fees and engage in any improper behavior, so as to maintain public relations, etc." Approved. In addition to sending a reply and separate orders, this order is issued to the district chiefs for compliance. This order, February 21st, 19th year of the Republic of China, Director Yuan Liang.</p>
<h3>Wusong Ship Merchants Request Reduction of Ship Taxes Again</h3>
<p>The merchants of Chonghai, Ning Shao, Wenzhou, Taishan, and Shandong, who operate sand fishing boats, previously stated that the number of ship taxes in the urban area was extremely high, and they could not afford it. They jointly sent a letter to the Wusong Chamber of Commerce to request the Port and Finance Bureaus to reduce the tax rate. The Port Bureau invited the Finance Bureau, the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, and relevant parties to discuss the matter on the 15th. As a result of the discussion, ships carrying sand, stone, and coal, regardless of size, were changed to paying one dollar per trip. The method for other large sailboats would be determined after investigation, etc. This was reported in this newspaper on the 16th. Since the decision on the collection method, all long-haul ships, such as wood ships, have arrived in Shanghai, and these ships only come to Shanghai four or five times (or seven or eight times) per year. Since it is more advantageous to pay the tax each time, they have all paid the tax to the Finance Bureau's Ship Tax Office according to the regulations. However, short-haul ships, such as pig and sand ships, etc., travel to Shanghai from other ports more than ten times a month, and at least four or five times. If they pay one dollar per trip, they would have to pay four or five to more than ten dollars per month, which they cannot afford. Most of them are waiting and watching, and they gathered the merchants of short-haul ships yesterday to discuss the matter. As a result, they unanimously decided to immediately send a letter to the Wusong Chamber of Commerce to request the Port and Finance Bureaus to reduce the tax rate and change it to collecting once a month to relieve the people's difficulties. It is said that the Wusong Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter to the Port and Finance Bureaus for review.</p>
<h3>Chen Tianxi's Whereabouts Unknown</h3>
<p>Jialong Ferry Located</p>
<p>Chen Tianxi, the son of Chen Yuezhou, a wealthy merchant from Yangsi Township, Pudong, and a current member of the Municipal Council, took the Jialong ferry from Zhoujiadu, Pudong, around 6 p.m. the day before yesterday to cross the Huangpu River. When it reached mid-stream, the boat and Mr. Chen were hijacked by bandits and disappeared. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Since the incident, Director Yuan immediately ordered the district offices and water patrol teams along the Huangpu River to conduct a thorough search. In addition to the district chiefs sending armed police officers to patrol the Huangpu River, Xu Jishi, the captain of the water patrol team, and Dou Menggan, the deputy captain, led all the police officers, fully armed, and traveled by car to track and pursue the bandits. Until 10:30 p.m., the ferry was discovered by Captain Xu near the Puyi Company pier in Wangjiadu, Pudong, Shanghai County. However, Mr. Chen had been kidnapped by the bandits and taken ashore, hiding without a trace. Captain Xu led the police officers ashore to track them down, chasing them past Chenjia Village in Sanlintang, but there was no trace. It was dawn, so they led the team back to Shanghai and reported the situation to the General Bureau. According to those close to Mr. Chen, he had received several threatening letters from bandits in the last lunar month of the previous year. Friends immediately advised him to stay at home and to bring more attendants when going out, so as not to be taken advantage of by bandits. Mr. Chen ignored them, so he was unfortunately kidnapped. It is said that Director Yuan attaches great importance to the case and has offered a reward of 500 dollars to solve the case as soon as possible. As for the Jialong ferry, it was not until 9 a.m. yesterday morning that it was able to sail back to Shanghai and resume its regular schedule to facilitate transportation.</p>
<h3>A Match Made Without Seeing the Whole Picture</h3>
<p>The beauty at the window showed only half her face</p>
<p>Who knew she was blind in one eye and lame in one foot?</p>
<p>Four years were wasted</p>
<p>Until a chance encounter in a theater</p>
<p>The daughter of Han Jingui from Yangzhou, named Ertou, is 24 years old and very beautiful, but unfortunately, she is blind in one eye and lame in one foot, hence the nickname "Half-Cut Guanyin." Due to these disabilities, she has been unmarried for a long time. A fellow villager, Liu Defu, 25 years old, who works as a bathhouse attendant in Shanghai, returned to his hometown to find a wife. Through the matchmaker, someone named Jia, a neighbor of Han, he learned how beautiful Ertou was. Liu didn't believe it and insisted on seeing her in person. They made an appointment and went to the Han house. The matchmaker instructed Ertou to sit by the window, with the window half-closed, showing only half her face. Liu saw that Ertou's skin was indeed as white as jade, and although he couldn't see the whole picture, he was sure that she was not ugly. They immediately agreed to the marriage and set a date. In the bridal chamber, he saw that the bride was blind and lame, and he was extremely frustrated. But it was too late. He blamed the matchmaker, but to no avail. The next day, he abandoned Ertou at home and secretly went to Shanghai, working as an attendant at the Yuqingchi bathhouse in Baoshan. Four years passed without him ever returning home. After her husband left, Ertou tracked him to Shanghai, searching for him for a long time without success. Ertou then asked a job agency to recommend her as a maid to the Wang family in Jifuli, Dagu Road, Public Concession. She then became involved with a rickshaw driver. The night before last, Ertou accompanied her master to the Gengxin Theater on Menggu Road in Zhabei to watch a play. Her husband, Liu Defu, was also watching the play in the neighboring seat with a friend. Ertou remained calm and secretly inquired about Defu's work address from his friend. Yesterday afternoon, she and her lover went to Yuqingchi and found Liu. In the ensuing argument, Liu, feeling ashamed, secretly bought opium and swallowed it, attempting suicide. His colleagues discovered him and rushed him to Baolong Hospital for treatment. He was still in critical condition at 8 p.m. last night.</p>
<h3>Two Men Compete for One Woman</h3>
<p>A third party intervenes</p>
<p>All three are taken to the Second District Police Station</p>
<p>A peddler of ants named Chongming Sanlang and someone named Jia from Chongming, who lived in a certain tomb in Nanmou Surname's Tomb House in the New West District Fenglin Bridge, brought a woman of about 20 years old from Chongming the other day. According to the woman, surnamed Li, they hid her in Jia's tomb house and planned to sell her to A'er, a carpenter, as his wife. They agreed on a price of 160 dollars. However, another carpenter, A'san, also intended to buy the woman as his wife, resulting in the two men competing for one woman, which could not be resolved. At 5:30 p.m. yesterday, Sanlang, fearing that the matter would be exposed, took the woman to the concession to sell her, so as to avoid competition. However, a Catholic named Yi knew about it and followed them to Fenglin Bridge. He gently persuaded the woman to go to the Catholic Church to be protected. Unexpectedly, the woman refused, and Yi insisted on taking the woman to the church in a rickshaw, resulting in a fight with Sanlang and others. A policeman on duty at Fenglin Bridge heard about it and, considering it a case of human trafficking, arrested Sanlang, the woman Li, Jia, and Yi and brought them to the Second District Police Station for questioning.</p>
<h3>The Maid is Suspected of Colluding with Thieves</h3>
<p>The key is of great interest</p>
<p>A woman named Chen Liang filed a complaint with the French Concession Court, stating that she had previously hired Liu Chen as a maid, who quit on the 9th of this month. Unexpectedly, Chen secretly stole the key to the back door. On the 12th, several thieves suddenly arrived, broke into the room through the back door, threatened her with knives, and forced her to hand over the key to the drawer. They robbed her of a large amount of cash, clothing, and jewelry and fled. Later, the woman found that the thieves had entered the house using a key, which was stolen by the maid, making her a suspect. Therefore, she reported to the police station, and the detectives arrested Chen. They found a key on her person. When asked why she did not return it, she hesitated, obviously colluding with the thieves. She requested that she be investigated. Liu Chen confessed that she had forgotten the key and did not return it, and denied colluding with the thieves to commit the robbery. Another suspect, Wu Baoting, confessed that he was a patrolman in the lane where the plaintiff lived. The maid, Chen, had previously asked him to make a spare key for her, but he did not know about the robbery. The official ordered the defendant to be detained and await further investigation by the police station.</p>
<h3>Both Men and Women are Shameless</h3>
<p>Tang Tang, a female worker in the weaving room of the Rihua Cotton Mill in Lujiazui, Pudong, got into a conflict with a male worker from the same factory, Hu Yunzeng, around 7 p.m. the day before yesterday. The factory, fearing that it would affect the work of other departments, immediately reported it to the police stationed in the factory. Tang and Hu were sent to the Third District of the Public Safety Bureau. According to Tang, 20 years old, a local resident of No. 137, Hepingli Workshop, works in the eighth row of the weaving room. That night, she went to the ninth row to borrow something from her younger sister, and male worker Hu Yunzeng reached behind her and groped her breasts, leading to the quarrel. Hu Yunzeng, 30 years old, from Ningbo, stated that Tang had taken his handkerchief and used it for weaving, which led to the argument. The district chief considered both parties shameless and fined them two dollars each as a warning.</p>
<h3>Attempted Suicide in the Huangpu River Due to Inability to Make a Living</h3>
<p>Fortunately Rescued by a Fellow Passenger</p>
<p>Wang Misheng from Qingpu, 40 years old, used to make a living by farming in his hometown. His family was initially well-off, but he became addicted to opium and spent his days lying in bed, smoking. After a few years, all his assets were exhausted, and he gradually became destitute. In recent months, he had no money to feed his addiction and had to borrow money from friends to inject morphine to resist the opium craving. His body was covered with scars. He thought that he was deeply in debt and had to borrow money everywhere every day, but the small amount was not enough to last long, and he would soon be destitute again. He was worried and decided to seek death to end his miserable life. Yesterday afternoon, around 1 p.m., he took a ferry in Pudong and jumped into the Huangpu River when it reached mid-stream, intending to commit suicide. Fortunately, a fellow passenger saw him and immediately came to his rescue, saving his life. He was immediately handed over to Fang Qingyun, a squad member of the Municipal Public Safety Bureau's Water Patrol Team, who brought him back to the team. Captain Xu conducted a preliminary interrogation. Wang confessed his past and said that he was foolish and regretted it very much. The captain then advised Wang and ordered him to be sent to a charitable organization for resettlement.</p>

<p>Cause of Death and Name Unknown</p>
<p>Around 7 p.m. the night before last, an unidentified man was found hanging himself at the Taikoo Wharf at No. 1, Gongguan Road, French Concession. His feet were in the water, and his upper body and abdomen were exposed above the surface. He was spotted by Chinese Constable No. 287 of the French Police Station, who notified Chinese Constable No. 7 of the Customs Water Patrol Police Station. They called two nearby boatmen and used a pole to try to lift the body. However, the body was heavy, and the rope around the neck broke accidentally, causing the body to fall back into the water. The constables tried again and finally lifted it up and took it back to the Water Patrol Police Station. The police chief observed that the body was about 20 years old, wearing a blue cotton jacket and trousers, with a shaved head, wearing leather shoes without socks, and had a flour sack cloth tied around his waist. He appeared to be a poor laborer. The cause of death was unknown, and his name, age, and place of origin were also unknown. Yesterday morning, he ordered Detective Ge Changsheng to transport the body to the Life Saving Bureau's morgue and reported to the local court to send someone to inspect the body.</p>
<h3>Lu Jianian Files Suit for Co-residence with Wife</h3>
<p>Feng Runting's daughter, named Lianwen, from Zhoupu Beishi, Pudong, is twenty-one years old this year. She married Lu Jianian on the twelfth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar last year. They were harmonious at first, but then she returned to her maiden home and repeatedly refused to return. Lu, having no other choice, hired lawyer Ye Shengchao to file a suit for co-residence, requesting Feng Runting to send his daughter Feng Lianwen (i.e., Mrs. Lu Feng) back and return the clothes and ornaments she took with her. Feng Lianwen also hired a lawyer to file a countersuit. Yesterday morning, Judge Ge opened the court to hear the case. Ms. Chen Zhenquan from the Women's Association also attended as an observer. First, the plaintiff Lu Jianian testified that he was twenty-two years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 7 Wengjia Sha, Gaochang Temple, Nanshi, and worked as a pattern maker at the Jiangnan Shipyard. He engaged Wang Hongdao and the woman Chen Longbao as matchmakers to betroth Feng Lianwen as his wife. She has been living in her mother's home for a long time, so he is requesting co-residence. (Asked) What is your intention in suing your wife's father? (Answer) I instructed him to send his daughter back to my home. (Asked) When did you get married? (Answer) On the twelfth day of the fourth month last year. Before the marriage, my relationship with her was very good, but one month after the marriage, her attitude changed. She often returned to her maiden home under various pretexts. The last time was on the sixth day of the twelfth lunar month last year. I went to pick her up many times without success and was even driven out. At that time, I reported to the district office there, but to no avail. On the thirtieth day of this month, I went to pick her up again, but she gave me the cold shoulder. Having no other choice, I came to court to request a judgment ordering co-residence and requesting the return of two pearl hairpins, a gold bracelet, a gold brooch, etc., worth about six hundred yuan in total. The defendant, Hong Lianwen, stated her age (omitted). (Asked) The plaintiff has two requests: (1) co-residence, (2) return of jewelry. How do you plead? (Answer) I only took one pearl hairpin, which I pawned for fifty yuan to go to school. I do not want to co-reside now and request separation. The judge said, "You cannot file a countersuit because co-residence is a personal lawsuit, while separation is an ordinary lawsuit. However, separation is very inappropriate for a married couple." The defendant replied, "We are a poor family, and they look down on me. I have suffered a lot of abuse from him." The judge then tried to mediate. He repeatedly enlightened and used all sorts of analogies to the defendant for an hour. The defendant finally said, "Since the court has advised me, co-residence is possible, but I need one hundred yuan a month for expenses." (Asked) How much does he earn each month? (Answer) Two to three hundred yuan. (Asked) You can't use that much alone. (Answer) That's for both of our expenses. At this point, the defendant's lawyer presented several letters from the plaintiff, which were letters from the plaintiff asking the defendant to borrow money, as evidence. The judge then said to the defendant's lawyer, "This case is in the process of mediation and has not reached the stage of debate." The judge then said to the defendant, "How about fifteen yuan a month for your expenses?" The plaintiff said, "I only earn twenty-five yuan a month." The defendant also said, "I got married on the twelfth of April, and on the twenty-eighth of that month, I returned to my mother's home and borrowed fifty yuan, which I gave to the plaintiff. On the fourth of June, the plaintiff stabbed me with a knife. On the fourteenth of July, he asked me to borrow three hundred yuan, and I borrowed fifty yuan again. He also borrowed two hundred yuan from my mother. My mother lent him thirty yuan because it was the first time he asked. On the sixteenth of September, he beat me, and I went to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment. I used to be quite fat, but if I were weak, I would have been beaten to death long ago." The judge then said to both parties, "This case is very simple, but this judge is very cautious about lawsuits involving married couples. There must be a thorough solution." He then instructed both parties to go outside to mediate. If they could not reconcile, he would summon the parents of both parties to court for further verification. He then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Hundred-Yuan Banknote</h3>
<p>Lost on the Road, Found by Rickshaw Puller</p>
<p>Wang Shaocheng, the assistant manager of Yongcheng Coal Company on Guangfu Road, Zhabei, hired Gu Zixiang, a Yancheng native, to pull a chartered rickshaw. Recently, due to Gu's illness, his younger brother Zhang Wu took over. The other day, Wang Shaocheng carried money and took a rickshaw to go out. He stopped at Beijing Road in the concession and suddenly lost 450 yuan in banknotes, including one Central South Bank hundred-yuan note, three hundred yuan in Citibank notes, and fifty yuan in McCallie notes. At that time, he asked the rickshaw puller Zhang Wu, who replied that he had not seen the banknote. Later, Zhang Wu returned home and suddenly told his brother that he had found a banknote on the road. He took it to a cigarette shop, which confirmed that it was a hundred-yuan note from the Central South Bank. Xue, Zhang's second landlord, heard that Zhang Wu had found a hundred-yuan note and found it strange. Fearing there might be something else going on, he went to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau to report it. At this time, Wang Shaocheng, who had lost the banknote, had also received the news and went to the bureau to claim it. The district chief, believing that this case involved embezzlement, had the defendant handed over to the judicial section for investigation.</p>
<h3>Strangled Female Corpse in Wheat Field</h3>
<p>Seemingly Abandoned After Death</p>
<p>At about 12:00 noon yesterday, an unidentified female corpse was found in a wheat field at the intersection of Huayang Road and Tangshan Road in East Shanghai. She was about twenty-two or twenty-three years old, looking like a village woman. She was wearing a blue cotton-padded jacket and pants made of foreign cloth, a pink striped foreign cloth outer garment, white gauze socks, and old cloth shoes. There was a deep rope mark on her neck, suggesting that she had been strangled. The corpse was abandoned in the wilderness. The police officer No. 2149 from the Tilanqiao Police Station found it and transported the corpse to Tongren Hospital to be sent to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road for examination.</p>
<h3>Wu Shunren's Suicide Case: Wu Dazhi's Request for Re-examination Denied</h3>
<p>Petitioner Lacks Solid Evidence</p>
<p>Guan Tiren Acquitted and Released</p>
<p>Wu Shunren, a Jiangbei native, hanged himself in his house at No. 697 Yuanhe Lane, East Yalu Road, on the 27th of last month. It had already been examined and coffined. Suddenly, Wu Dazhi and Wu Jianyin, claiming to be the deceased's younger brothers, said that their brother's death was related to the second landlord, Guan Tiren, and requested that the coffin be opened for re-examination. The court decided that it must first investigate before ruling, so it summoned them the other day, but both Wus failed to appear, so it decided to postpone the hearing and notify the plaintiffs to appear in court for further questioning. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, Wu Dazhi, accompanied by his lawyer, arrived in court. The police also brought Guan Tiren to court. Judge Gao Junxiang presided over the first courtroom. Wu Dazhi testified that he was originally from Yancheng, now residing at No. 22 Helin Lane, North Sichuan Road, Huajie, and made a living selling chickens and ducks. The deceased was a brother from the same clan. He only learned of his death from Long Ju, who lived with him, at 6:00 PM on the 27th of last month. He rushed to the scene and saw the deceased completely naked, facing inside, sitting on the bed, with rope marks on his neck, appearing to have been strangled. If it was suicide, he must have been suspended in the air and could not have been sitting on the bed. Because of this suspicion, he specially requested that the coffin be opened for re-examination. After hearing the testimony, Judge Gao declared that the deceased had been previously examined and confirmed to have died by suicide. Now Wu Dazhi suddenly requested to open the coffin for re-examination, and the reasons he gave were all based on speculation and lacked solid evidence, which was difficult to believe. The request for re-examination was rejected, and Guan Tiren was acquitted.</p>
<h3>Judgment in Da Lun Company's Lawsuit to Recover Insurance Compensation</h3>
<p>Da Lun Company Wins</p>
<p>Da Lun Company, located in the West Zhonghe Lane, Fuzhou Road, shipped thirty pieces of silk goods to Chongqing, Sichuan, in January this year via the Pingfu Steamboat. They insured the goods for 11,000 taels of silver against marine risks with the Axulun Siyuning Insurance Company at No. 7 Hankou Road. The insurance stipulated that the defendant would compensate for any damages caused by the steamboat running aground, sinking, or colliding with other ships during the voyage. However, the defendant would not be liable for any damages caused by war, riots, or pirates, or damages caused by loading on the deck of a barge. Later, the Pingfu Steamboat encountered a reef in the rapids of Kongling Tang, upstream of Yichang. The engine room and boiler room on the starboard side of the ship were damaged, and river water poured in, causing a fire. The captain, fearing for the lives of the passengers and crew, ordered them to leave the ship. Nearby residents, seeing this situation, took the opportunity to board the ship and seize luggage and goods, and then set the ship on fire. Da Lun's goods were completely lost. The company then sought compensation for the insurance premium from the insurance company, but the company refused to pay. Despite repeated negotiations, there was no result, so Da Lun Company hired lawyer Shen Yuesheng to file a lawsuit against Kemen, a Westerner from the company, requesting a judgment ordering compensation of 11,000 taels of silver, plus interest at 8% per annum from February 17, 1929, until the date of execution, as well as litigation costs. The Provisional Court heard the case, and lawyer Shen presented five points of argument on behalf of the plaintiff, which were debated by the defendant's lawyer. It is now known that Judge Yang, who presided over the case, has announced the judgment. The main text stated that the defendant should compensate the plaintiff with 11,000 taels of silver, plus interest at 5% per annum from June 22, 1929, until the date of execution. The plaintiff's other requests were rejected. The litigation costs were borne by the defendant. The full text of the judgment is very long, divided into three parts: the main text, the facts, and the reasons. The reasons section is further divided into five points, detailing the defendant's liability for compensation, citing Chinese and foreign laws, and deliberating repeatedly, which is extremely fair. The judgment has now been sent to both the plaintiff and the defendant.</p>
<h3>Girl Dies of Skin Disease</h3>
<p>Zhou Xiaogen, a nine-year-old girl from Zhou Yinhu, a villager in Zhoujiaku, Hongkou, suffered from scabies and was itchy all over. Zhou sent the girl to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He then sent her to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but it was also ineffective. She died at about 8:00 PM the night before. The hospital believed that skin disease would not cause death and suspected that there might be an internal disease, so it notified the Harbin Police Station to send police officers to transport the corpse to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road for an autopsy to determine the cause of death. Yesterday morning, the police reported to the Provisional Court to commission Judge Wang Jianzu to come to the office for investigation. First, Deputy Chief Detective McDing of the Harbin Police Station filed a report, stating the situation. Then, the corpse's father, Zhou Yinhu, and his wife, Zhou Zhang, stated that their daughter suffered from skin disease, which recurred from time to time. This time, according to people, an injection could cure it, so they sent the girl to the hospital for an injection, but it was ineffective and she died. She had no other illnesses and requested to be exempt from the autopsy. Judge Wang, after hearing the report, approved the exemption from the autopsy and handed the corpse over to her parents for coffining.</p>
<h3>Money Industry</h3>
<p>Stack Workers Request Increase in Silver Handling Fees</p>
<p>The workers employed by money shops, who are responsible for carrying silver and foreign currency, are called "stack workers". Their wages have always been very low, no more than a few dollars per month. They rely entirely on the income from handling fees for delivering silver, foreign currency, and drafts to make a living. The responsibility is heavy, and the profit is small, which is inherently difficult. In recent years, they have suffered from economic pressure, which is even more unbearable. Having no other choice, they gathered all the stack workers in the industry to discuss remedies. As a result, they sent a letter to the board of directors of the industry, requesting three types of consideration. The original letter is as follows: "Omitted above" We believe that rice is as precious as pearls, firewood is as expensive as cinnamon, and life is difficult. The world is chaotic, and the years are barren, making it impossible to make ends meet. We express our suffering and humbly request your consideration, and propose the following three items: (1) Request that all double handling fees and cutting fees in the industry be calculated in silver dollars (fractions less than one yuan will be calculated according to the small silver-dollar exchange rate for silver coins). (2) Request that all shops pay for collecting drafts from banks with double handling fees and cutting slips. (3) Request that for entrusted bank transfers from local and foreign counterparts and affiliates, a handling fee of 2 jiao per thousand taels and 1.4 fen per thousand yuan be given, all calculated in silver dollars. "Omitted below" It is heard that the Money Industry Public Board, after a full discussion at the 11th annual meeting of the inner circle, unanimously agreed that items 2 and 3 could not be approved by the association alone. However, they agreed to the item that all double handling fees and cutting fees in the industry should be calculated in silver dollars. It has been resolved that the starting date for implementation will be March 1. It has been notified to the market to inform all colleagues to follow.</p>
<h3>Meeting Record of Jisheng Association</h3>
<p>Proposal for Disaster Relief in Various Provinces</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association proposed to hold a meeting on disaster relief in various provinces on February 18 this year. Members of the executive committee, supervisors, and all committee members in charge of the six groups attended the meeting, including Chairman Wang Yiting, Vice-Chairmen Xu Qianlin and Huang Hanzhi, and over thirty other committee members. Mr. So-and-so reported that the disaster in Shaanxi was great and severe, and the spring famine was even worse. The starving were everywhere, which was unbearable. The association is currently carrying out armed spring relief. The original disaster relief center in Xi'an has been expanded with two more centers in Wugong and two disaster relief centers for children. There is also one disaster relief center for children in Xianyang, rescuing thousands of disaster victims and children. In Wugong, Fufeng, Mei County, and other places, many people have starved to death, and their bodies are piled up. There were dozens of mass graves that need to be widened, covered, and expanded to prevent epidemics from occurring in the spring. The association has provided winter relief in Linhai and Ninghai counties in Taizhou, Zhejiang. Mr. So-and-so proposed that spring relief should be carried out first in Yongjia and Leqing counties in Wenzhou. Feng Yangshan, Gu Qixian, Li Yushu, and other relief friends were recommended to be responsible and set off on a scheduled date. However, the disaster situation in Yuhuan County is no less severe than that in Yongle County. The association should treat all counties equally and provide relief, either half or the entire county. The public believed that there was a shortage of manpower and finances, and people with both courage and knowledge were needed to determine the next steps. Although the disaster in Zhejiang is not as severe as that in Shaanxi, the suffering of the spring famine is unbearable. The association in Beiping is currently operating two porridge factories outside Chaoyangmen and Xuanwumen, as well as emergency relief in over forty villages such as Nankou, Mentougou, and Zhaizitang. There are many other disaster-stricken areas. The floods in Wuhu and Xuancheng counties in Anhui Province have also caused severe damage. Emergency relief is currently being planned. The disaster areas in Shaanxi, Hebei, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces mentioned above are too large. Although the relief funds have been spent significantly, the great disaster cannot be fully relieved, and there is nothing that can be done. The members of the association had no choice but to hold a meeting to raise funds and have all tried their best to take responsibility and solicit donations to allocate relief. However, the strength is limited, and the efforts are like a drop in the bucket. It is hoped that philanthropists in the country will contribute to creating blessings, so that everyone can work together to rescue the people who are in dire straits. This is what all the members of the association and hundreds of millions of disaster victims hope for. The association held a meeting and proposed disaster relief. The limited strength and difficult situation in the four provinces can be imagined. They are now soliciting donations and will soon go to Yongjia and Leqing counties in Wenzhou to provide relief. They are currently deploying everything and will set off immediately.</p>

<h3>Tobacco Merchant Insulted While Collecting Debts Appeals to the Guild</h3>
<p>The Shanghai South Tobacco Exchange Association received a letter from Qian Wenda, the owner of Yihua Xiang Tobacco Shop at Gongyihe Wharf, saying that his shop, in order to settle the accounts for last year, sent a clerk, Chen Housheng, to Fengxian on January 24 to collect outstanding payments from various customers. When he went to Tongyu Shop to collect 32.5 yuan, the payment had been settled with him personally before, and it was agreed to be paid by the end of the old lunar year, so he went to collect the payment this time. At first, he repeatedly delayed the payment. Later, on the evening of the 26th, he was told to come back after all the accounts had been collected. Not only was the payment not made, but he was insulted and scolded. When Housheng argued with him, the owner of the shop suddenly instigated a person claiming to be the Baozheng (local security officer) to slap Chen several times and ordered many people to surround and beat him, causing him to be seriously injured. The bag containing the collected payments was scattered. After counting, the payments from Gu Taichang and He Shun Chang shops, totaling more than 230 yuan, were lost. He reported to the chairman of the county's Chamber of Commerce and returned to the shop, where he has been bedridden and receiving medical treatment. The above situation has been confirmed by him, and he requested the county's Chamber of Commerce to submit the matter to the county government for investigation, but no good news has been received. Therefore, he specially appealed to the association to uphold justice and requested the association to submit the matter to the Merchant Assembly for a unified support and forward it to the authorities for strict investigation and legal action to protect and secure business, which is beneficial to morality.

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the Editor, We hereby state that according to Qiu Zhou, the wife of the late Qiu Weiqing, she read in the news column of your newspaper on the 20th of this month a section about her younger sister suing her brother for harming their mother. It stated that Qiu Weiqing's estate was over one million yuan and that he had two sons, the eldest named Sheng San, who was reported by his married younger sister Qiu Dingbao to the Shanghai Local Court for the crime of local tyrant and evil gentry, etc. There are many errors in this. Qiu Sheng San and Qiu Dingbao are both children of Qiu Pei San, nephews and nieces of Qiu Weiqing, and not children of Qiu Weiqing. This time, the dispute between Qiu Sheng San and Qiu Dingbao has nothing to do with Qiu Weiqing. Fearing misunderstandings, we were entrusted to write a letter requesting a correction. We hereby provide the information in a letter, hoping that you will investigate and make the correction. Sincerely, Chen Wenzhao, Lawyer, February 21.</p>

<h3>Japan Has a Song Dynasty Edition of A New Account of Tales of the World</h3>
<p>According to Japanese news, the printed editions of "A New Account of Tales of the World" from the Ming Dynasty and earlier are long lost in China. Japan currently has two Song Dynasty editions, one in the Imperial Library and the other in the possession of Marquis Maeda. The edition in the Marquis's possession has already been reproduced, consisting of three volumes: upper, middle, and lower. There is also a "Preface to A New Account of Tales of the World" and a "List of People in A New Account of Tales of the World," totaling five volumes. It is feared that they are unparalleled treasures within the country. The author of "Research on Ancient Documents and Old Books" claims that the paper is pure and clean, the ink is bright and lustrous, the engraving is exquisite, and the color is ancient and elegant, which is rarely seen in Song editions. Both the Imperial Library edition and the Maeda edition have the seal of the Kanazawa Library. Furthermore, an ancient handwritten scroll edition of "A New Account of Tales of the World" is stored in a certain ancient temple in Kyoto. Connoisseurs have determined it to be the work of a Tang Dynasty person. Around the middle or late Meiji period, it was taken out by a certain Mr. Nishimura and distributed to many enthusiasts. It is currently unknown where it is scattered.</p>
<h3>Increased Import of Japanese Goods After the Gold Standard on Tariffs</h3>
<p>According to Japanese news, after the sharp drop in the silver market in the first and middle ten days of January, there were almost no new transactions for exports to China. It was predicted that there would be a panic in trade with China. However, when China announced the gold standard on tariffs, it prompted early exports, and exports to China increased in the first ten days of January. The Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) ships carrying goods from Osaka to Shanghai reached 5,785 tons. After the implementation of the gold standard on February 1st, a relatively good situation continued. The shipments in the first ten days reached 4,135 tons. It is predicted that the shipments in February will be about 12,000 tons, an increase of about 6,000 tons compared to the same period last year.</p>
<h3>An Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and American Poetry</h3>
<p>"An Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and American Poetry" is a very rich collection of modern poetry. This book is published by Houghton Mifflin Co. It has 826 pages and is divided into two parts: the first part is British poetry, and the second part is American poetry. Hardy leads the British poetry, and Mut (WV Woody) leads the American poetry. The advantage of this book is that each author has a short introduction, which makes it easier for readers to understand what kind of person the author is. (Jasmine)</p>
<h3>All Quiet on the Western Front Raises Legal Issues</h3>
<p>Lei Lüjun</p>
<p>"All Quiet on the Western Front" was written by the German soldier Erich Maria Remarque. Since its publication, sales have soared to tens of millions of copies, and there are translations in various countries. It is generally considered the world's greatest war novel. It has also been adapted into a movie in the United States and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the summer. In October of last year, Hong Shen and Ma Yanxiang translated the original book into Chinese, which was published by the Equality Bookstore. The translation is exceptionally faithful and fluent, making it a rare work in the translation field in recent years. Since its publication, it has attracted the attention of the domestic literary scene. Critics have praised the translation's ability to convey emotions and have unanimously praised it. The translated version has recently been reprinted. Unexpectedly, the Equality Bookstore recently received a letter from Ullestien Bookstore in Germany, the original publisher of the book, claiming that the book was translated and published without its permission, which was deeply refuted. Finally, they demanded 10% of the profits be given to their bookstore. The Equality Bookstore has already replied that China has not yet joined the International Publishers Association. Regardless of the country of origin of the books, regardless of whether permission is obtained from the original author or the original publishing house, as long as there is a book in hand and someone who can translate it, they can start translating, and the bookstore can publish it. This kind of convenience is enjoyed by both China and Japan, and the proliferation of translations is not unrelated to this. It is still remembered that the Commercial Press was sued in London for reprinting a certain original British book. The defendant's lawyer, Ding Rong, won the final victory based on the principle of disseminating knowledge. This matter is purely a moral issue rather than a legal issue.</p>
<h3>New York Art School Travels to Europe and Africa</h3>
<p>The New York City Art School, headed by Michel Josobs, plans a six-month overseas painting lecture and practice program to promote friendly exchanges with the European art world. It is planned to conduct longer-term investigations and descriptions in South European countries where art is very prosperous, such as Italy, Greece, Spain, France, and Switzerland, so that the dormant American art world can flourish due to foreign sentiment. It is currently scheduled to depart from New York City in May under the personal guidance of Michel Josobs to complete the work in Southern Europe and also to describe the tropical scenery of the North African coast (Changxi).</p>

<h3>Fire at Guanghua Girls' Dormitory</h3>
<p>Fire is both frightening and lovely. No one in the world hates fire like an enemy, but neither would anyone love fire like life itself. How can fire inspire love? There are many examples. Winter is not yet over, and the stove fire is naturally among the precious things. The firelight blazes, reddening faces. Intimate words are whispered, gazing at each other as if drunk. Not to mention those who enjoy cigarettes, valuing a match and a cigarette almost equally. Beautiful ladies use fire to tame their hair, creating waves, curls, light mists, and tied-up styles, all thanks to the power of fire, with endless variations. Looking in the mirror for a while, casting glances at the liquor lamp, who dares say they don't love fire? As for those who cherish a lamp as if it were life itself, or rely on fire for a living with rising cooking smoke, that simply surpasses the word "lovely" ten thousand times over.</p>
<p>Ruthless flames destroy everything. After a great fire, what remains besides a few charred logs and a pile of ashes? The four words "pitiful scorched earth" are the most accurate description of the scene after a fire. Frightening fire comes suddenly and leaves cleanly, like striking a match. The flame appears before your eyes, and the straight, dry stick transforms into a charred piece from beginning to end. In a moment, losses of tens or hundreds of thousands are caused by fire, and even lives are endangered. This is not a rare occurrence in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The girls' dormitory of Guanghua University on Da Xi Road suddenly caught fire the day before yesterday morning. It only burned for half an hour or so before the palace-like building was declared lost. The roof was completely burned away. The cause of the fire has not been determined, but it is said to be related to the boiler room for heating. This fire is no small matter. Sadly, the trunks, bedding, bookshelves, and belongings of more than eighty girls were mostly reduced to ashes. The most unpleasant thing was for the female students from other places, who had only started school one day ago and hadn't even arranged their belongings before they were confiscated by the Fire God Bodhisattva.</p>
<p>The girls' dormitory is in the southeast corner, and the building was only built last summer vacation. The building alone cost 12,000 yuan. It is a one-story building divided into twenty-four rooms, including a reception room, a washroom, and a bathroom. The rest are bedrooms. The entire building is rectangular, with the corners of the roof upturned, like a palace. Behind the building, in the southeast direction, is another room with a boiler for heating, a small chimney that rises straight outside the wall. The pipes for the heating run into the bathroom in the dormitory for warmth. It has been working well since it was installed. At eight o'clock the day before yesterday morning, the whole school was in class. About five minutes later, the girls' dormitory reported a fire. The fire was very fierce, starting from the roof and heading northwest with the wind. In an instant, it was beyond control. School staff called the fire brigade, but the fire brigade was not nearby, and it took a lot of time to get through. According to the fire brigade's report, they received the message at 8:20, which undoubtedly took a lot of effort. The first fire truck to arrive came from Jing'an Temple. The Jing'an Temple fire brigade is naturally in the concession. Although Fahua Town has a fire engine, whether it works or not is a question. The result of rushing to seek help was that distant water could not quench the nearby fire.</p>
<p>The fire truck arrived, but tap water could not be brought from the concession. The water from the artesian well was useless, so they had to draw water from the creek in the Wang family cemetery. Fortunately, there was a pump, which could barely be used for firefighting. However, the water pressure was weak, and the effect was minimal. It was not until the roof was burned down and the floorboards burned through that the fire was extinguished. When the fire broke out, there was bound to be a lot of panic. That night, the girls stayed in the classrooms in the east courtyard. They then tried to vacate the faculty dormitory near the gate to serve as the girls' dormitory for this semester. Some of the girls who lived in Shanghai went home that day, and classes could resume as usual on Monday.</p>
<p>Watching the fire from across the bank is not a refined literary pursuit. However, in the rubble field, one cannot avoid some lamentation. That night, we took electric torches and crossed the open space to view the aftermath of the disaster. There were three people, several dogs, two electric torches, a rifle, and a policeman accompanying us. The standing water on the muddy ground had not yet dried, and stepping on it was a bit sticky. We first circled the house, unable to find the gate. Walking to the back of the house, we saw the boiler for heating, which was already cold. The straight chimney was still leaning against the wall. The stove, which was originally lovely for generating fire, now seemed to be sighing after being cursed.</p>
<p>Through the window frame, we glimpsed the mess inside the bedroom in the light of the electric torches. The table tops were charred as black as charcoal. The burned-out electrical wires and the pipes for the heating hung diagonally in the middle. There were about five or six small iron beds in each bedroom, all lying upside down and scattered about. Fragments of bedding, clothes, and books were visible everywhere, as well as many letters, manuscripts, and copies scattered all over the ground. This is what differentiates it from a normal fire site. Of the twenty-four rooms, eight or nine out of ten were destroyed. Only the washroom was still in good condition, without any damage. The white porcelain washbasins and the milky white wainscoting were as cold and quiet as the surrounding air. We then stepped across the open space and saw the east and west courtyards opposite, brightly lit, shining straight into the open space from the windows. The soft air permeated the night, and I wonder how the girls felt about hating that "fire" (Lin).</p>

<h3>The Italian Painting Exhibition in London</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>From January 1st to March 7th of this year, an Italian art exhibition is being held at Burlington House in London. This exhibition can be said to be the greatest and unprecedented painting exhibition in the world. It has collected all the masterpieces of Italian painters, many of which are priceless treasures. Special commissioners were sent to various countries to transport them. Masterpieces of important Italian painters collected by national art galleries, museums, and private collectors in Italy, Germany, France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Sweden, the United States, England, and Ireland have all been borrowed for display in this exhibition. The total number is more than 600 pieces, of which 300 were transported from Italy, and more than 100 are owned by the United Kingdom. It is said that these six or seven hundred rare treasures are worth more than 14 million pounds, which is equivalent to Chinese currency.</p>
<p>200 million yuan</p>
<p>or so. Is this number large? But in reality, the value of these paintings is actually more than this number, because many of them are priceless treasures of various countries and will never be sold. Such a large painting exhibition has of course caused a sensation throughout Europe. Not to mention the people of London, everyone is talking about this painting exhibition. Although Burlington House is spacious, there are still too many people to see it, and it is crowded. However, this is indeed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. For three or four hundred years, the paintings that could only be seen by traveling to the art galleries of major cities such as Rome, Florence, Naples, Venice, Paris, and Berlin can now be viewed comfortably in one or two days. Can such a good opportunity be missed?</p>
<p>Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican of course cannot be moved to England, but Italy has sent some portraits of Raphael. Michelangelo's sculptures, except for "David," cannot be moved, but he also has some paintings that can represent him. In addition, works by Giorgione, Titian, and Veronese can represent the art of Venice, works by Guido Reni can represent Naples, and works by Botticelli can represent Florence.</p>
<p>Michelangelo's "David" is placed in the middle of the main hall, flanked by statues of David sculpted by Donatello and Verrocchio. Around them are some busts made by Bernini and Vittoria. The paintings are displayed in two large rooms, glassware and crafts are displayed in one room, and modern Italian sculptures are displayed in one room.</p>
<p>Almost all the most worthy of study and appreciation of Italian paintings are here. Among the great Italian painters, the works of Giorgione are the most difficult to obtain and the most precious, but this painting exhibition has three of his masterpieces, one is "The Tempest," one is "Portrait of a Man," and one is "Moses Undergoing Trial." The tragic beauty of Mantegna's works is represented by the famous "Resurrection" and "On the Cross." In the center of the large wall, in the most honorable position, is Botticelli's first masterpiece,</p>
<h3>"The Birth of Venus"</h3>
<p>How beautiful this painting is! Once you have seen it, you will never forget it for the rest of your life. He has several masterpieces, such as "Madonna and Child" and "The Legend of Saint Magdalene." There is a screen in the middle of the large exhibition hall, with seven small paintings hanging on one side and eight on the other, one side representing Florence and the other representing Rome, including small masterpieces by Raphael and Botticelli.</p>
<p>The representative of Venetian art is Titian. His works include "Diana and Actaeon" and "The Cornaro Family." In addition, there is Giorgione's "Adulteress," Domenichino's "Salome," Cossa's Portrait of an Unknown Man, and many other important works. Because there are too many, I can only leave them out.</p>
<h3>Casanova</h3>
<p>— Sunflower</p>
<p>This is a masterpiece of Southern European literature that I have ever read, "wonderful beyond compare." The original is in French. I only carry an abridged version with me. The original is eight thick volumes, titled "Memoirs of Casanova," Mémoires de Casanova, said to be written by Casanova. The entire book is nearly two million words, and the abridged version is only one-tenth of the original, renamed Les Plus Belles Nuits d'Amours de Casanova. If translated into Chinese, the direct translation would be "Casanova's Most Beautiful Nights of Love." The book records the memoirs of the author's life of love. It can also be called a biography of a romantic talent or a record of romantic affairs, but what is described inside is definitely not comparable to the recently popular mawkish notes or sexual novels on the market.</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>Those who have read old Chinese novels are all familiar with "flower butterfly" as a nickname for an immoral person. In Western literature, there is also a similar character, whose ability and reputation are much higher and more shocking than the Chinese "flower butterfly." I remember that there was a film in Shanghai that depicted a part of his life. It seemed to be strictly banned by the authorities when it was released. The translated name of the film was "Butterfly Collecting Flowers," originally titled "Casanova." According to general literary researchers, Casanova was a famous immoral figure in 18th-century Europe. Because he loved so many women, he left a memoir, which clearly describes all the romantic affairs he experienced in his life. The published part, although it has been revised, is still listed under the category of immoral books. Translations have been made in various countries around the world, but most have been banned from distribution. However, this extraordinary book has been recognized as a good artistic masterpiece by recent literary authorities, and it is very moral. It is a good book for training virtuous husbands. Healthy and pure young men and women will definitely get some enjoyment in life after reading this book.</p>
<p>Casanova and Don Juan are models of handsome men in Western literature, just like Saint Maria, the representative model of beautiful women in religious literature. They are the two female-centric heroes that are often mentioned in literary works.</p>
<p>Don Juan is a legendary figure, who has been immortalized by the depictions of several great writers in later generations, such as Molière in France and Byron in England. But the issue of his own existence has been studied by many researchers. As for Casanova, at least he has his own memoir, so we can use real evidence to study his true face.</p>
<p>He was the son of an actress, born in Venice, Italy in 1725. He was an exceptionally gifted child prodigy. At the age of eleven, he had a first love, falling in love with a teacher's daughter. In the same year, he was able to write short Latin poems. His life's experience was rich, numerous, and extremely complex and changeable. Not only in love did he have many fantastical adventures, but his status and position also changed dramatically. Sometimes he was a priest, sometimes a military officer, sometimes a man of letters, sometimes a painter, sometimes a musician, sometimes an actor, sometimes a businessman, sometimes a wizard, sometimes he opened a hotel, or set up a gambling hall, honored as a guest country's auxiliary minister, impoverished as a vagrant fugitive. He personally experienced all kinds of situations and levels in society. One day he was a guest of honor, and the next day he was a prisoner. In his life history, it was commonplace and not surprising. His personal life history can really be read as a social life history of that era.</p>
<p>He was born with a strong and sturdy body, full of energy, with bright eyes, dark irises, and a pale complexion. There was an unusual and incredible brilliance on his face and physique that made any woman who saw him fall in love with him. He was kind and generous in his dealings with people, intelligent and resourceful, and well-versed in ancient and modern scholarship. Although he was a devout believer in religion, he had a spirit of self-improvement. He captured the hearts of many women, but he never made a woman sad. He traveled to all the major cities in Europe, such as London, Berlin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Paris, etc. Everywhere he went, he received the favor of beautiful women.</p>

<p>Speaking of his living conditions, they were truly mysterious and unpredictable. He did not inherit the legacy of his relatives, nor did he receive public subsidies. He did not engage in huge profits or receive unexpected bonuses. He lived one day at a time without worrying about tomorrow. He squandered lavishly, indulging in lust and drunkenness, and gambling heavily, until his pockets were empty. Whenever he reached the end of his rope, wealthy women would come to his rescue. According to reliable investigations, a certain noblewoman spent nearly a million yuan for him in nine years.</p>
<p>Almost all the women he had been in love with in his life were described in his memoirs, but he himself wrote that there were still twelve women that he did not want to announce. The names of these twelve women were permanently hidden in Casanova's heart.</p>
<p>He died in 1797 at the age of seventy-two, leaving behind a memoir, which was a strange book that he wrote for thirteen hours every day in his old age.</p>
<h3>The Story of World Literature (141)</h3>
<p>— Written by John Macy, translated by Hu Zhongchi</p>
<p>Chapter 37: Victorian Poetry</p>
<p>Before Thompson's genius was discovered by good friends and saved him, he was miserably poor, lonely, and impoverished. His gorgeous and brilliant fantasies were an escape from the misery of life. For poets and readers, poetry is such an escape. In the religious ecstatic poem "The Hound of Heaven," in the poems venerating the pure and noble love "The Sister Songs" and "The Dearest of the Loves," and in the mournful "Poems on Children," he found comfort. In "The Poppy," he expressed, as in Shakespeare's short poems, the imparting of immortality to his own subject matter and his own soaring consciousness. Let this chapter conclude with a quote from this poem, because it speaks of the poet's story and the final victory of that poet's illusion:</p>
<p>Love, ah, love, your flowers of withering dreams</p>
<p>Lie safely in the leafy shades of rhyme,</p>
<p>To avoid the reapers and the reaper's reaper, "Time."</p>
<p>Hiding in the leafy shades of rhyme,</p>
<p>Love, ah, I was seized by the claws of "Time,"</p>
<p>Yet there still remains in the leafy shades of rhyme</p>
<p>My withering dream, my withering dream, respected by this world.</p>
<p>Chapter 38: Nineteenth-Century French Prose. After Walter Scott's gorgeous but prosaic romances, what remained to be created were other, more beautiful and complete romances. This is the dramatic and narrative poem, gorgeous but poetic, realistic but idealistic, true but magnificent romance. Victor Hugo.</p>
<p>Wherever something always exists, wherever something always coexists, Romanticism has its fools, and it has its wise men. Remy de Gourmont.</p>
<p>Therefore, the French Romantic school can be called, without exaggeration, the largest literary school of the nineteenth century. George Brandes.</p>
<p>The Romantic era of French literature corresponds somewhat in time and spirit to the Romantic revival in English literature, and both are related to the ideas contained in the French Revolution. The English movement, not to mention Brandes' words, was much stronger than the French. And in England, because there happened to be greater writers than in France, the movement flourished earlier and more abundantly. The times (let's take 1800 graphically as its center) agitated the intellectual world of England, and the poets of England responded. The intellectual world of France was melancholy, and even if we don't mention Keats and Shelley, who were not heard of in France until after their deaths, writers comparable to Scott and Byron only appeared in France in later generations. From the French intellectual world of the eighteenth century, although Voltaire's personal fame remained, his clear and pungent wisdom disappeared as a literary force. The dominating force at that time was Rousseau's sentimental Romanticism, transformed into religious emotion and intellectual reaction by Chateaubriand. Chateaubriand's "The Genius of Christianity," published at the beginning of the same century, was the most powerful new book in France. Although it was mixed with a large amount of argument and theology, it was not a defense or praise of Christianity in the tone of argument or theology, but in the tone of color, beauty, and symbolism. The worst place is preaching, and the best place is stained glass and the organ of a great temple. An anecdote, the story of "René," is a romance of a young soul filled with sorrow, often seen in novels and poems throughout Europe. Shelley's "Alastor" and Goethe's "Werther" are expressions of the same idea丨丨because this idea permeated the general society at that time, so it was not directly borrowed丨丨Carlyle's rather harsh answer to this whole idea was this, "Youth, no more idling, go to work!"</p>
<p>In modern novels, we have these desolate, dissatisfied youths, but we prefer to send them to doctors called psychoanalysts. Whether those doctors are wiser than Chateaubriand is not yet known. "Wherever something always exists," his sad tone did not impress the English readers as deeply as it did the French a hundred years ago. Why? Because English romances have known for two centuries the sad, skeptical youth called Hamlet, and English novels around 1800, although containing much of the nonsense of the time, were still dominated by the strong healthiness of Fielding and Smollett, and will be dominated by the equally strong healthiness of Scott. Chateaubriand lived in England for several years, and translated "Paradise Lost" in his later years, and conversely, many of his works were also translated into English. However, for reasons that have been suggested, perhaps incorrectly, he was not widely read in England. His rhetoric is unpleasant to modern Frenchmen. However, just as so many Frenchmen lost their heads on the guillotine and elsewhere, he was the master of that transitional period between when French prose lost its head and when it regained a clear head on its strong shoulders, that is what they know.</p>
