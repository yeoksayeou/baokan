<h3>英法德之政局</h3>
<p>今日世界之財政困難問題與工人失業問題混合而成一世界最棘手之問題其影響足以動搖政局。蓋今日無論何人。當此問題之衝者其應付政策决不能使各方面皆表满意满甲方之意者乙方即起而攻擊满乙方之意者丙方丁方即起而反對。在攻擊與反對。者縱不借爲黨派政爭之工具而亦必指斥政府辦法之不善應付之無能於是政府及益處困境而政局遂因以不安矣試舉今日一日中所得之消息證之。</p>
<p>英下院以二八二票對二七四票通過保守黨所提出之煤礦修正案政府　　失敗席上狂呼内閣辭職麥首相料反對黨將有彈劾之舉。</p>
<p>法議會以三○二票對二五五票通過共産黨所提出之豫算修正案雖此表决未提信任問題然内閣已大受打擊。</p>
<p>德國會以二五一票對一七四票通過楊格計劃二讀案外間料總统有解散國會意惟尚須待國民黨全體大會之結果如該會不贊成政府之財政計劃則閣潮難免。</p>
<p>夫英之所謂煤礦案法之所謂豫算案德之所謂楊格計劃案皆與財政而兼失業之問題有極大關係同日波蘭國會中。社會黨提出一不信任勞工總長案内閣已有動搖之虞。此案雖未詳其原因惟以波蘭之財政狀况觀之當亦不外乎是除此數國而外美國會以失業工人過多政府尚無辦法擬提質問日本新國會開始反對派議員亦甚注意於工業衰落救濟失業問題可見今後世界目光將全集於此最不易解决之一問題而各國政府之命運亦即繫於該問題應付之如何列强向於外交上所恃以替代武力之唯一經濟政策返之國内固亦有時而窮乎。</p>

<p>美代表方面之聲明</p>
<p>路透社十一日倫敦電海會美代表方面聲明美國决不能參加一種地中海洛迦諾條約、保障法國安全、藉以换取法國噸數之减少、姑不言此種辦法之要價還價的性質、美代表以爲如美國簽定一種恊商公約、則將來法國發生戰事時、美國在道德上或不得不有他種舉動、而不僅以恊商爲限、美人對此問題、輿情甚堅、寗可代表團放棄全部五强條約、而不願受此種恊商之義務、聞英代表團對於地中</p>

<h3>日美間之兩難關</h3>
<p>電通社十日倫敦電李逹本日午后訪松平、會談二時間、五時辭去、此次會見並無何等進展、惟雙方諒解、微有動機、或爲事實、至日美間意見、難於一致者、其難關有二、（一）一九三六年止、八時一萬噸级巡洋艦、美國保有十五隻、日本十二隻、此爲日本所難承認者、縱令日本讓步承認、則殘餘之三艦建造年限又將何如、（二）是否承認八時巡洋與六時巡洋艦融通轉换、此二點照目下形勢、兩國意見决難一致、故悲觀論漸趨有力、</p>
<h3>日代表團會議對策</h3>

<p>路透社十二日倫敦電昨晚政府在下院之失敗、無足重視、此乃自去年六月工黨執政後之第一次失利、但其失利之點、</p>
<p>不過爲審查階级中之一種隨意條文耳、</p>
<p>下院在票决以前、已知政府不以此爲信任問題、首相所謂之彈劾機會、指稅率而言、將於星期四日發生、届時政府可得自由黨之完全扶助也、</p>
<p>路透社十二日倫敦電各報一致謂昨晚政府於煤礦案在審杳階级中遭遇失敗之結果、大約一俟預算案辦妥後、則將舉行大選舉、蓋政府常受兩反對黨合力之攻擊、已不勝其煩也、</p>

<h3>綏遠石拐溝大煤礦</h3>
<p>足可開採一百四十三年</p>
<p>每年出煤有五十四萬噸</p>
<p>可獲利二百一十六萬元</p>
<p>塞北通訊、綏遠大青山支脈、有石拐溝、發現富量煤田、雖有漠南及冀昌兩公司試採、不過九牛一毛、尚未探到密窟、近經礦學家王永壽一度查勘、其煤量之富、及出額之豐、獲利之厚、實屬驚人、誠爲國内之資本家採礦家聞所未聞、今略誌於下、以覘該礦之實際、</p>
<p>（一）地勢及地位石拐屬綏區固陽縣治、離包頭六十餘里、位置略偏東北、高出包頭八百餘尺、雖沿途山巒起伏、幸斜度不甚大、鋪設鐵路、尚不致十分困難、石拐以北十餘里、山嶺綿亘、有正溝召溝、南北冲贯其間、故山坡不甚峻峭、將來採礦施工、頗爲容易、</p>
<p>（二）地質及煤層大青山一帶、多爲侏羅紀岩石、直覆於太古層片麻岩之上、石拐煤層、即在此、侏羅紀含煤之砂岩中與砂岩層層相間、該處煤層雖多、然有開採之價值者共有三層、每層相問之石層、約自數十尺至二百餘尺不等、第一煤層之厚、自三尺至五尺、第二層厚約七八尺、第三層厚四五尺、據該地老窰工云、第三層曾發見煤層、厚一丈餘、衹舊窰中水量過大、非土法開採所能爲力、因而停工云、大青山侏羅砂岩均甚堅實、而煤層即夾在此砂岩之中、故頂板底板皆極穏固、無須窰木支撑、不惟施工容易、將來於出煤成本上亦可低廉也、石拐以北、南北八九里、東西正溝召溝之間、及召溝之東、共六七里、即漠南公司及冀昌公司之礦區、面積約有六十方里、地層成爲一種盆形式、四邊傾斜、最大不過三十度、極爲整齊、且少斷層及巔側錯亂等變動、石拐最有價值之三層良煤於此、皆有露頭在附近山坡上、土法開採之小窑中、尤爲明瞭可證、將來大青山一帶煤田、能通鐵路、利用機器、作大規模之開採、當以此處爲最佳、</p>
<p>（三）煤質及煤量石拐附近所産皆爲上品長熖烟煤、據分析者云、此煤約含揮發素３００１０、固定炭素約５５０１、水素約１３９１０、炭約１３５１０、火車輪船及工廠家用、均極適宜、且黏性甚大、士人用以煉焦、成績甚佳、第二層煤、則黏性較小、不甚宜於煉焦云、此三層煤中、除第一第二兩層、位置頗高、一部分已受冲蝕、及士人略事開採外、其第三層、或全未受何等影響、儲藏尤爲豐富、照最低限度、現有三層煤、平均厚爲十尺、假定煤層爲平坦、則六十方里應有煤三百八十五萬七千六百二十五噸、設每天出煤一千五百噸、每年共出五十四萬噸、依此、則石拐煤田、足可開採一百四十三年、即折半計算、亦足開採七十餘年、</p>
<p>此行調查所得、略爲比較、當以石拐煤田爲最有價值、且有可以立即開採之希望、以煤層頂板底板之堅固、不必用窑木支撑窑内、乾涸無須費工抽水、故採煤工作進行、極易出煤、成本亦甚輕、每噸成本約自一元半至二元二三角不等、以窑之深淺、出煤之難易而定、窑上售煤、每噸價值約三元、因交通不便、運輸全賴大車及牲口背負、計自石拐至包頭、往來三天、祇能運煤一次、故運費每噸五六元、因此石拐煤在包頭非售價每噸十元不可、若復由火車運至綏遠、則每噸又非售價十八九元不可矣、大青山煤之所以不能與大同煤竸爭者、無他、運輸問題而已、故欲發展石拐煤礦事業、非速修自包頭至石拐鐵道不可、運輸問題不能解决、石拐礦業斷無發展之希望、查石拐至包不過六十餘里、鐵道運輸、每噸最多亦不過二元、如採煤成本每噸照二元計算、再加鐵道運輸二元、至包頭售價每噸八元、則每噸可得凈利四元、苟每日出産一千五百噸、則每天可得凈利六千元、每年可得凈利二百一十六萬元、</p>

<h3>日本對遠東籃球錦標之預測</h3>
<p>▲菲得錦標中日有劇戰</p>
<p>▲日本游泳已從事練習</p>
<p>（一）日本對於籃球之希冀</p>
<p>日本第九次遠東大會名譽總幹事藥師寺氏日本籃球界元老此次大會籃球敎練員茂木貞三氏即其入室弟子因藥師寺氏事務紛忙而爲之代庖者也記者六日往訪之詢其對於此次大會籃球錦標之觀察氏謂在已往七次大會中籃球錦標爲菲島獲得者共七次本人觀察以爲此次仍非菲島莫屬一則以歷史上的關係菲島佔優二則菲島此次準備之完善實遠非中日兩國所能比肩菲島去秋即已選訂代表從事練習且鑒於氣候與壓與運動員實力有莫大之關係（前年美國選手在世界運動大會失敗一般體育學者均認爲係氣壓不同有以致之此說有科學之根據云）故在山顛特建籃球場、使日光之强弱氣候氣壓之高低恰與東京五月時無異俾球員將來雖身處異域亦能不感困苦其計劃之周密於此可見一班亦决無不勝之理、分析籃球隊之實力應從三點着眼（一）隊員之體格（二）隊員個人之技術（三）全隊連絡功夫、日本歷次均以缺此二點而失敗近來已有覺悟因而從事補救、今年即以此二點爲選拔遠東候補隊員之標準、日本以近年極力提倡體育之効果一般青年類多體格增高體力加健第一點之困難已勝過至於連絡功夫則由平日各校比賽之觀察成績甚好、再加一二月之合宿練習可望盡善惟個人技術一層上不無略弱一籌耳、此蓋由於日本人習於重視連絡功夫、每以隊爲開始練習之單位、而造成之恶果現在合宿練習、期内决在此點上多加工夫可得相當成績若以中國已往的成績而論、則三點中以個人技術一項特長每以個人技術爲當選隊員之標準而個人行動敏速者常多軀幹短小且至今隊員尚未選出將來必至臨渴掘井各方挪凑、則連絡功夫、必難見長也故就本人所見以爲此次大會錦標定屬菲島無疑至中日間之竸爭、當極熱烈誰勝誰負未可必云</p>
<p>記者按蔣師寺民對於三國實力之批評固不無合夫理論之處惟對於日隊未免自信太深耳就記者個人觀察而言日方籃球一藝近年確大有進步但板滯遲緩之惡習爲其致命傷并已經根深蒂固、决非短時期所能改正、此次大會仍難有若何大希望也</p>
<p>（二）游泳選手積極練習</p>
<p>關於遠東大會游泳選手預賽等事、前已見本報、現日本關東水泳恊會及全國學生水上竸技聯盟鑒於大會日期將近而刻下天氣寒冷户外游泳池不便練習、因商得明治大學當局借用該校新落成之二十五米長室内温水泳池、作練習之用、每週兩次、收費一月以去秋已指定之代表選手、及希望今春出席遠東大會預選會者爲限、並派定游泳宿將松澤一鶴等五人爲練習指導員云</p>

<p>▲主席報告今天是本黨總理孫先生逝世的五週紀念、總理離開了我們、到現在足足有五年了、總理的一生事蹟、可以拿『從事革命』四個字來包括、總理生在世上、領導我們所做的工作、完全是做革命的工作、總理一生所具的思想、完全是革命的思想、總理一生所備具的人格、完全是革命的人格總理自已說、他致力國民革命、前後凡四十年、這四十年、簡直如一日、而且有一個中心的目標、這中心目標、就是要求中國之自平等、中國因爲失去了自由平等、所以總理在生前、曾作不斷的奮鬥、雖然經過許多次的失敗而他對於革命的决心、却因失敗而更堅决、我們想到满清的糊塗政府之所以能够推倒、代表封建勢力的大小軍閥之所以能逐漸消滅、帝國主義併呑中國的野心之所以能够逐漸剷除、我們更想起現在的民衆之所以能够由最痛苦的境地、慢慢解救出來這許多工作、是誰領導我們做的、當然是我們的總理、可是現在我們的總理是死了我們彷佛小孩子、現在已經變成失了慈母的小孩子、我們又彷彿是盲子、現在已經没有人來指導我們、所以我們從總理逝世的那一天起、直到今天爲止、這五年中我們没有一天不在哀痛悲傷哭泣之中、我們哀傷我們已經失掉一個救星、我們哀傷我們已經失掉一個慈母、我們更哭泣世界上所有的弱小民族都失掉了一個偉大的領導者、所以這五年來、我們的情緒、幾乎充满了悲哀、我們的心、幾乎充满了苦痛、現在我們之所以能够自已安慰自已的、就是至今還在大道奔跑、這完全是總理所遺留給我們的大道、指示給我們走、同時也因爲有總理的繼承者在、時時領導我們、總理生前、在千辛萬苦的當中、創造了三民主義、更從千辛萬苦的當中、组織了中國國民黨、我們現在能够不斷的共同努力、完全爲了總理的三民主義、來指導我們、總理所遺留下來的唯一寳貴的中國國民黨在、領導我們、所以在總理逝世的五週紀念的一天、回想起總理生前的苦心回想起總理生前艱難困苦的工作、回想起總理單身北上的大無畏精神、回想起總理在北京逝世的那種慘痛景象、我們更回想到總理遺體在南京奉安那種隆重的樣子、這一切的一切、都浮現在我們的　子裏、使我們的眼涙、不自禁而　流、在這遇去的五年中、一方面悲痛我們失掉了慈母、失掉了我們的救星、眞覺得萬分的悲哀、所以够自已安慰的、就是北洋軍閥的整個勢力、是完全擊碎了、由總理所領導的力量、已經由這個支離破碎的局面、形成了全國統一、可是中國現在還是完全處於極危險的境地、五年來的樂境、離然很多、可是經遇的艱難困苦、不知有多少、以大的方面講、譬如共産黨的搗亂、曆如大小封建勢力的　興、和歷届叛變的紛起、這許多事情、現在已經一件件的在我們的眼中浮現了遇去、在每一次刦難到臨的時候我們就想起了我們的總理、如果總理在世上、許多千奇百怪的現狀、絶對不會有的、可惜我們的總理、現在是没有了、我們看到總理生前的情况、每有違反民衆利益的軍閥興起的時候、總理必然挺身出來、領導民衆、與軍閥奮鬭、從軍閥手裏、奪還了民權、現在軍閥、表面雖然消滅、而封建勢力、還到處可以找到、我們想起這種情形、更加悲痛、我們衹能依照總理所遺留給我們的敎訓、遵守總理的遺敎、在總理所領導下來的中國國民黨之下、共同向一切大大小小的封建勢力進攻、使一切大大小小的封建勢力、完全消滅、這是我們今天紀念總理第一個意義、其次、我們想到帝國主義向我們進攻、已經不止一年二年的事情了、到了現在、帝國主義者、要作他們最後的掙扎、向我們進攻、歷届我們所看到的、如日本濟南的慘殺、英國在上海和廣州的慘殺、俄國在中東路的慘殺、處處可以表現帝國主義者、是在繼續不斷的向我們進攻、總理生前、是領導我們向帝國主義者作殊死戰、指揮我們向帝國主義作不斷的奮鬭、現在我們是失了導師、失了慈母、失了救主、失掉了慈母、可是總理雖死、反對帝國主義的遺敎、仍然在在、我們要求中國之自由平等、祇有依照總理遺敎、遵守總理所給我們的敎訓、在總理所遺留下來的中國國民黨領導之下、向帝國主義作不斷的進攻、使我們中國能够得到自由平等、這是我們紀念總理逝世的第二個意義、第三我們知道、總理曾經敎訓我們、中國是一個生産落後的國家、祇有大貧小貧的分别、所以應當儘量造産、使勞資兩方、平均發展、總理手創民生主義、來指導我們、我們回想起、當時總理所給我們的許多遺敎、對於目前中國社會组織破産的危險狀况、實在覺得非常悲痛、不過可以自慰的、就是總理還有方法留給我們、指示我們、要平均地　節制資本、呌我們如何造産、如何建國、如何發展實業、這許多遺敎、我們覺得要使中國民生問題解决、中國經濟組織不破産、祇有繼續總理遺旨、遵照總理遺敎、在總理所領導下來的中國國民黨之下、團結起來、共同發展中國的生産事業、能救目前的經濟困難、這是今天紀念總理逝世紀念的第三個意義、在今天很悲痛的當中、回想起總理生前、所領導我們的情况、以及總理逝世以後五年中所嘗到的甜酸苦辣各種滋味、現在可以作個結論、就是我們的總理没有死、總理的肉體雖然離我們、但是他的精神、是在永遠指示我們、他的遺敎、是在永遠敎訓我們、他所遺留下來的中國國民黨、是在永遠地領導我們、我們祇有按照總理遺敎、遵照他的三民主義而奮鬭、這是總理生前的意思、也就是今天我們紀念總理的意思、今天是一個很隆重的哀悼大會、如果各位有紀念總理的時候、請大家紀着幾句很鄭重的話、就是我們要繼續總理的遺志、遵守總理的遺敎在總理所遺留下來的中國國民黨之下共同、奮鬭、</p>
<p>▲演說摘要潘公展演詞、適纔聽到不席沉痛的報告、我想在座諸位、都有一種說主出的痛苦的感想、回想總理、在北平逝世、距離現在、已經五年了、在這五年中、我們究竟收獲些什麽效果、就說總理遺囑的第一句、求中國的自由平等、尚未做到、雖則現在我國在國際上、經逼了本黨同志和革命的民衆的五年奮鬥、已得到相當的地位、可是我們再想想、國際的地位、究竟平等了没有、我們已得到國際上的自由没有不平等條約、還没有劉除、現在要念總理不要注尚儀式、而要時刻刻的去繼續總理的遺志、方才主席所告訴我們的三點念的意義、固然不錯、但是要做此二種事、必須要有一種力量、有了力量、方能表現出來、現在我們在中國國民黨三民主義領導之下、集中我們的力量、來共同奮門、但是發現我們的力量、必要有组織、而現在組織有了、目的也有了、尚未能元成這個責任、當然在我們一般後死者、我們不能託詞搪塞、我們現在哀痛的感想、便是良心自疚、也便是我們自已慚愧、現在對於總理的遺敎、未能有完满的結果、我們當一反省以往的工作、爲什麽在這幾年中、没有得到相當的成功或者可說、一半因爲社會環境的關係、而革命的事業、也不是一蹴可幾的、總理革命了四十年尚囑我仍須努力、完成革命的工作、而我們不如總理、自難能成功、不過這是自慰、我們應當要曉得自已的錯誤、總理曾經告誡我們、革命先要革心、方寸之地、没有革洗好、怎麽可講革命配做革命的工作、救國救人類呢、我們必須要將腐敗的恶劣的思想行動遏制了、才配做革命工作、紀念總理、我們當然反省之餘、拿全部遺敎來做我們的座右銘、我特地提出這點來自勉、同時貢獻給諸君、第二、我們須犧牲個人的自由、總理告訴我們、中國太自由了、好像一盤散沙一樣、這便是中國的致命傷、要補救此缺陷、須要嚴密我們的组織、要犧甡自已個人的自由、遵守團體的法規、現在一般反動的學者、竟提倡天賦民權、這種已是十八世紀的陳腐學說、我們應當要去　滅他、不要再來害我們、來淆亂人心、總之、（一）我們要切戒行動不要浪漫、（一）反省自已的錯　、同時要下决心、犧牲自已一切的自由、爲革命的事業而努力、那末我們紀念總理、才不失去紀念的意義、完了、又劉湛恩曾義等相繼演說、辭長不錄、</p>
<p>▲大會口號（一）紀念總理偉大的人格、（二）繼續總理革命的精神、（三）犧牲個人自由、貢獻一已能力（四）嚴密黨的组織、遵守黨的紀律（五）擁護中央、鞏固黨的基礎（六）撲滅殘餘反動勢力、努力訓政工作、（七）促進國家统一、厲行地方自治、（八誓遵總理遺敎、取消不平等條約、（九）厲行造林運動擴大造林事業、（十）總理精神不死、（十一）日國國民黨萬歲、（十二）中華民國萬歲</p>

<p>▲張市長報告今日爲總理逝世之五週紀念日、總理人格之偉大、功業之榮高、早已無人不曉、有口皆碑固無庸吾輩之贅詞、故今日紀念總理、不僅含有追悼意味、且將發揮光大總理之志行願力、會塲空氣、充满總理大無畏之精神、於嚴肅悲哀之中、表現雄奇壯烈之情思、莊嚴宏偉之氣慨、恍如總理照臨在上、依然領導吾等在革命大道上、一步一步向前進行、因此數人對於今日紀念總理、有兩種感想（一）紀念的價值民國創立以來産生了好幾個革命紀念日如武昌起義、南北统一等等、各有各的意義、各有各的價值、但一切紀念、因革命産生、總理却是革命之開創者、有總理纔有革命、有革命纔有紀念、换言之、一切革命紀念日、均爲總理所産生、故紀念總理的價值、遠過於其他革命紀念日、而總理一生的紀念、莫大於誔生日與逝世日、總理誔生、於是中國的國民革命有了曙光、總理逝世、是四十餘年革命歷史之一段落、總理以其未竟之志、未了之願、訂立遺囑、付托我等、繼續奮鬥、完成革命大業、故其逝世紀念、爲承上起下光前裕後之一日、其價值比諸誔生紀念爲重大、比諸其他一切革命紀念日尤爲重大（二）紀念的意義、由上所述紀念的價值之重大觀之即可推知其意議遠粝深長、今試剖析爲三、分述如下、（甲）領導的精神、總理爲創中華民革命之第一人、舉凡已往之革命先烈、現在之革命同志、將來之革命後生、皆在總理領導之下、努力奮鬥、繼續進行、總理生平、周游列國、與各弱小民族之革命志士、深表同情、時時唤起其革命興趣、故不僅領導中國之革命者、且亦領導世界之革命者、總理生平、到北平兩次、其第一次在民國元年、大無畏之精神、深入虎穴、觀察袁世凱帝制自爲之野心、而揭破其逆謀第二次即在民國十三年、其時清室根本取銷、段祺瑞自稱執政、總理不避艱危、親往視察欲以和平奮鬥革命、唤起北方民衆、卒以高年過勞、一往不返、遂致病逝北平、而北方民衆、因此大爲感動、表熱烈同情於革命、而全國人士、更因此震驚奮發、以慰總理在天之靈、故總理領導之精神、不僅貫注於全國、並且貫注於世界、不僅表現於生前、並且表現於死後、其博大宏深、實爲古今中外所未有、（乙）　予承的責任、總理臨終、以革命尚未成功的　個責任、付托於我們後死的同志與同胞在總理遺囑上、如求中國自由平等、唤起民衆、及聯合世界上以平等待我之民族、共同奮鬥、和　除不平等條約等等、又如總理遣著建國大綱·建國方略·三民主義·及第一次一國代表大會宣言都是指示我們革命的逾徑、和建設的方法、我們試仔細的回想一下、我們對於總理所交給我們的責任、究竟已經做到什麽程度呢所以今後的責任、是非常重大、今日紀念總理、應如何努力奮鬥、共同担負此重大的責任、使之早日完成、方不負遺囑諄諄臨終付托的一番美意　幾今日之紀念、尚有意義·有價值·垂諸久遠永矢弗諼（丙）建設的努力、總理所謂革命尚未成功當然係指全部而言、由軍政而調政而　政一切建設工作、循序進行、勿苟且因循勿搪　敷衍、勿鹵莾滅裂、勿操切草率、自有完成之一日、現在訓政已定期限、六年之間、轉瞬即届、由訓政而人憲政、亦不在遠、惟是憲政根基、均須於訓政時期、建立鞏固、所謂以黨治國之精神亦在此而不在彼也、訓政時期之建設工作、均規定於建國大綱中、吾輩欲完成革命之期望、須於訓政時期之一切建設工作、共同負担、遵照總理遺囑者、身體力行、勿自暴棄、勿稍懈怠則六年期满懸望可僅目前之一切受　阻力、實　必　之　程、所　可避免者但以總理大無畏之精神、爲一切建設工作之使命　揚蹈厲、邁步前行、則總理雖死猶生、期　魂昭昭在上、赫赫在前、領導我等於光明正大的革命大道上、决不退後一步、以完成總理整個革命的願望以上三點、實爲今日紀念總理逝世之重大意義、有此重大的紀念意義而後有上述的重大紀念價值、歲月如流總理逝世、已五易　署、深望同志同胞於此莊嚴悼之今日、母忘紀念之意義與價值、提起精神、負起責任、以完成革命其同之願望、實爲至要完了、</p>
<p>▲潘局長演說今天在細風苦雨中、開總理逝世五週紀念大會兄弟連想到今天的天氣就彷佛五年前總理在北平逝世的時局一樣我們記得、總理最後的呼聲、是和平奮鬥救中國、自從北伐以來、一直到今大、全國已經統一在國民政府領導之下、似乎和平空氣、充满了全國上下、可是還有少數軍閥、還在那襄做破壞的工作、我們要和平、就不得不同破壞和平的人去奮鬥、以求逹到最後的目的救中國、這樣才可以把中國不平等地位提高起來、所以我們紀念總理的時候、應該隨時去注意這三句話、但是在這三句話中間、奮鬥最爲重要因爲奮鬥的目的、不是爲個人權利來奮鬥、是爲多數民衆奮鬥的、所以我們要以服務爲目的把一切事情做好、雖要各人做的事情、有大小和地位的不同、有的爲一二個人服務、有的爲百十個人服務、的爲千萬人以至大多數人服務、但是如果忘記爲公奮鬥、在私人權利上着想便不能得到和平、便不能救中國、好比我們在上海做事、須要明白、爲二百七十萬市民服務不斷的奮鬥、那們一天便可以得到一天的成績、一年便可以得到一年的成效、人人如此則和平可期、中國才可救好、總理的遺訓很多、可是我們只要記得和平奮鬥救中國、這三名話便可以繼續總理的遺志、完成革命的全功、所以兒北在今天紀念總理的時候特地把他提出來、希望諸位切切實實的注意一下、</p>

<p>▲市長演說辭我們在總理逝世紀念日這一天、爲紀念總理人格之偉大、舉行植樹儀式、不過是表示實現總理的林業政策、提倡全國人民自動的起來植樹、上海特别市舉行植樹儀式、連這一次、已經是第三次了、前年是第一次、在今天會場的東面小木橋路舉行、去年是第二次、分浦東浦西兩處舉行、今年是第三次、在這裏舉行、到會的人數很多、但是除了黨部的同志·各機關的公務員·學校的敎師學生之外、民衆方面、自由參加的、似乎不甚踴躍、這是值得我們注意的、究竟是因爲我們宣傅植樹的意義、没有充分嗎、我們提倡的力量、不甚完備嗎、還是全市市民、還没有明瞭造林可以調和氣候、防止水旱、有益衛生嗎、凡是今天我們到會的人、都應該當作一個重大的問題、研究研究、在兄弟認爲在上海的市民、對於植樹之提倡、應該特别注意、第一、上海是一個都市、我們在都市中生活、就是在短命的地方生活、我們拿鄉村來與都市比較、鄉村的空氣、如何的新鮮、鄉村土地、如何的有生機、大都市裏頭、除開特質建設方面享到一些便利、其餘天然的生活、那裏有像村　舒服、所以世界各國、不論那個都市、從人口的统計、都已證明、都市人民比鄉村人民爲短命、我們上海人、大家有一個毛病、以爲植樹是鄉村人民所幹的事情、好像說、都市人民不屑去做、於是把植樹這椿事業、看得很輕、其實我們住在這種短命的地方、若不利用植樹來吸收炭氣、供給酸素、整天的在鴿籠式的房屋内生活、水泥和柏油的道路上行走、於衛生上旣多弊害、如查再逢天時的變化、疾病的流傅、可以說、市民的生命、時時發生危險、我們要想以都市鄉村化的政策建設大上海、補救這個缺點、不得不希望市民大家起來提倡植樹、第二、我們中國、原來是以農立國的國家、植樹當然也是農事之一、可是我們來論森林木材、各位請想、現在我們上海所有一切建設所用所木材、是否中國自産、當然都知道、現在上海建築所用的木材、都是洋松、洋松是外國貨、爲什麽我們不用中國貨、實因中國的木材、已是不够使用了、中國木材、爲什麽不夠使用、因爲我們中國人、太不注意植樹、尤其因爲我們住在都市中的人民、以前太不提倡國貨木材、講到這裏、我就想起這一次去福建所感學的一件事情、在閩北方面、有一種風俗、這種風俗、很值得我們注意、就是他們地方、人家新生了兒子、一般親戚朋友、都去恭賀、他們恭賀的方法、就在這家生兒子的家宅、或所有土地上、種植樹木、他們的意思、大槪以爲種植小樹、待他日漸長大、以喻小兒之長大成人、因此風俗、於是福建就爲中國出産木材最重要之區、從前時候、福建每年輸出木材、值一千五百萬元、大半銷至上海、但是現在因爲我們上海人、愛用洋松、不去提倡、以致他們銷數减少、每年輸出袛值一千萬元、如果我們中國人、立刻學悟、各大都市的建築、大家都採用國貨、林業自然可以立刻發逹、上海人如果首先提倡、其效果當然甚大、是於國家經濟、國民經濟、均有重大利益、最後還有一些痛心的感想、就是過去種不良的現象、我們以前兩次植樹運動、提倡的結果、雖然也有些成績、但是仍有不少恶劣份子、非特不知道植樹的價值、共同來參加植樹、愛護切樹木、反將路旁所植樹木、損傷竊取、這是表演我們市民的弱點、被外人見了、批評起來、何等恥辱、我們希望此後經過一次運動、這種現象、要使不復發現才好、我們到外國的公園裏去、看不見有禁止攀折花木的標識、在中國、不便在公園裏、就是在人家家裏、也看見這種標識、可見我們中國人、不但對於提倡不注意、而且不知道愛護、希望各位同胞同志、今後對於提倡造林、及改良我們同胞的這種劣性、多加宣傅、多加注意、</p>
<p>▲領種苗木者踴躍市社會局前飭園林塲、預備苗木一萬六千餘株、供各團體領取種植、先期派員、將各處領苗者種類數量標明清楚、自昨日上午九時起、各領苗者、在檢發處、塡具收據後、依次領取、計全日領去者、已過四分之三、　　▲口號（一）植樹是紀念總理、（二）植樹是市政建設必要的工作、（三）普徧植樹、可以防止利源外溢、（四）要建設事業、先要植樹、（五）要解决衣食住行先要植樹、（六）植樹是自已久遠的儲蓄、（七）努力植樹運動、</p>
<h3>華輪各路復航</h3>
<p>華商輪船、自去年四月份起、即停班休航、一年來、如六八及十一月分、雖曾一度復班、顧未久即又輟行、若招商局之長江輪江天、快利·及三北之富陽等等、均遭十餘月之長時間的停班、其他之時停時行者、長江船常有十六七艘、而外海輪亦在十艘以上、在去歲滬上華輪停班最多時、計有七十餘艘、上年華航商之不幸、爲歷來所未有、前月租用華輪、已可放回一部、在此長江水脚飛漲聲中、已可有若干華輪可以供給商運、此誠商業界之福音也、亟爲查誌如下、</p>
<p>▲江輪復業本月上旬、華商三北公司虞洽卿氏曾電致蔣主席請求酌抽江輪數艘、放應商班、以免外商之乘機漁利、又復電致漢口船舶管理局長邱煒、要求其免扣通行之船、蔣主席徇滬航商之請、業將招商局之江新·江華·江靖·及江順等先行釋放、而三北公司之長安、伏龍等、亦於同時釋回、故本星期起、長江班内中國商輪可先行六輪、三北公司之新寗興、在途損壞引擎、刻亦修好、不日可來滬上、而飛處輪之被江貞撞沉者、該局一方設法打撈、一方向海軍部提出交涉矣、　　▲北洋通航北洋一路本年自白河開凍後、華商輪祗開行過一次、嗣以長江貨攤、致新年等均調駛滬漢、而烟津間航運、盡入外輪拿握中、而日商川崎汽社、乃臨時增開華北專班、爭奪貨運權、本星期起、招商局已恢復北洋輪、新銘新豐二輪、在前昨兩日、業經往津、尚有公平輪、因往青島載馬福祥之衛隊等一千餘名至安慶、俟其在上陸以後、亦可來滬復行牛莊等埠矣、營口現已開凍、昨日滬上各輪公司已接得該埠電報、請派船往運積貨、本埠太古大連等公司、已議定從十五日起、通航牛莊缐、</p>
<p>▲青島貨阻金漲潮流、自本月分二次發生激變之際、正值上海洋貨大批裝出之時、青島客帮、即來電報、言該埠所裝到之貨、存儲在棧中者、受金漲暗虧、各客家均不肯提卸、以致棧中满堆貨件、後到者更無存積之地、着上海暫且停止裝貨前往、除零星貨物外、其大批貨已終止運赴青島矣、</p>
<p>▲南洋貨擁上海裝赴南華之汕厦粤出口貨、近日以生仁生餅、　子等最多、十分擁擠、太古·怡和·日清等乘此無華輪行駛之時、遂提義由本月十七日起、加增水脚百分之十五、其理由則籍口金漲潮流、開支加大、以資補苴、粤商帮邇日突電招商局、請求派船、以免洋商壟斷南華航權、招商局已調出廣大泰順等輪、從本週起、先行南洋班、以供客家之需求矣　▲尚有本埠新聞轉入後頁</p>

<h3>陪審英領之無理留難舉動</h3>
<p>—揚推事審訊兩案經過—</p>
<p>▲英籍律師藐視法庭</p>
<p>▲言詞舉動俱極荒謬</p>
<p>▲英領無理曲意廻護</p>
<p>▲法院已謀對付辦法</p>
<p>本月十日上午十時、臨時法院楊兆龍推事於第六法庭理華洋執行案件、由英領赫勃脫陪審、當日排審之案件中、有英商華商銀行與黃鴻鈞欠欵一案、及英商喊哩洋行與萬利源貨欵一案、</p>
<p>▲華商銀行與黃鴻鈞案當由推事先審第一案、按該案係江蘇交涉公署附設華洋上訴處所判决、依照判决主文、被告應償還原告若干欵項、原告亦應償還被告若干欵項、惟原告已在清理中、其所欠被告之欵、不能十足償還、而被告所欠原告之欵、則應如數給付、前幾次開庭時、債務人代理律師提出債權債務、互相抵銷問題、要求原告讓步、當由雙方聲請暫緩執行、以便在外和解、經推事照准、并當庭將該案改期至本月十日再理、</p>
<p>▲限兩星期内償還欠欵迨前日開庭時、被告代理律師未到、原告代理人葛福萊律師聲明、雙方和解不成、請求查封被告所設商號推事以被告代理律師未到庭、或因未記清法院所諭知之日期、被告本人、或無過失、認爲查封商號、尚非其時、遂當庭裁决着被告於二星期内遵判將欠欵償還原告、原告代理律師對於該項裁决、表示不满、聲稱『敝律師今日到庭之目的、即在鈞院之執行本案、今鈞院僅限令被告於二星期内付欵、不能謂爲執行、敝律師直不知鈞院下此裁决之用意何在、』當由推事答曰、『限令被告於二星期内付欵、亦執行手續之一、』</p>
<p>▲旁聽西律師公然批評言至此、在庭旁聽之英籍律歸勃朗（即於另一案内代表英商喊哩洋行者）忽縱聲曰、『Ｚ○』（即中文『不對』之意）、推事以該律師以旁聽人之資格、而對於法院裁决、膽敢公然批評、殊屬目無法紀、有意侮辱、當即問其何以出此、并囑其退庭、乃該律師始則不答、繼則曰、『余自言自語、并非有意觸犯庭上、』推事以其出言狡滑、遂不復與之理論、</p>
<p>▲陪審英領之無理責難詎陪審英領事赫勃脫頗以推事之措置爲不黨、反責難曰、『法庭中談話者甚多、爾何獨干涉該律歸一人、』推事以其態度偏頗、不可理喻、爲寗人息事計、亦未置理、</p>
<p>▲喊哩洋行與萬利源案其次審理者爲英商喊哩洋行與萬利源一案、按該案被告向原告定貨未出、原告向被告訴追貨價銀約四千兩、經法院判决確定後、原告聲請執行、當由辦理執行案件之徐推事、諭令原告將被告未出之貨、依照估定價格、於七日内交拍賣行拍買、否則將其提交法院、以便指定拍賣行賣、乃原告始終未遵該諭辦理、</p>
<p>▲定貨未交法院之理由楊推事接辦該案後第一次開庭時、即問原告代理律師勃朗以不遵諭辦理之理由、據稱原告對於該項未出之貨有留置權、現已與被告商妥、以該貨抵償一部欠欵、其餘欠欵、亦已由被告付清、故現在聲請將本案撤銷、</p>
<p>▲定貨抵價若干均不知推事以被告萬利源已宣告破産、英商喊哩洋行應與其債權人受同等待遇、其與萬利源之債務關係、未便任其私自了結、當即詢以該未出之貨抵償若干欠欵、及其餘欠欵如何由被告償還、乃該律師對於各該問題均以『不知』一語答之</p>
<p>▲欵已照付實無權扣貨旋被告萬利源代理律師稱、被告所欠原告貨欵、已由被告以現欵如數償還原告、原告對於被告未出之貨、不復有留置權、應請責令原告將該貨交還、當提出原告所出四千餘兩之收據一纸爲澄、</p>
<p>▲否認收欵應負舉證責推事遂詢問原告代理律師該收據是否爲原告已收受被告四千餘兩現欵之憑證、該律師答稱、該收據係關於另一買賣所出、與本案無涉、當由推事告以該收據之數額、旣與本案判决内所載者相符、足證其與本案有關、原告如否認該項事實、應負舉證之責、乃該律師非惟不以推事之主張爲然、反聲言『如被告及其債權人或法院不满意於原告之行爲、不妨至英國公堂訴原告』、</p>
<p>▲法院無權傅訊英人乎斯時陪審英領事白載脫對於推事之主張、表示反對、推事以爭辯無益、遂裁决着原告遵照原裁决、將被告未出貨物提交法院、聽候措置、詎陪審英領對於是項裁决、亦表示反對、其理由爲臨時法院對於英國人民、無發命令之權、嗣該案經另行定期傅訊、英領白戴脫竟以中國法院無權對英國人民發傅票爲理由、拒絶於送逹與原告之傅票上簽字、</p>

<p>▲出庭係表好意於法院届期勃朗律歸照常代表原告出庭、推事以該律師已聲明撤銷委任、當詢以何種資格出庭、該律師以前後行爲矛盾、不能自圓其說、沉思許久、始答稱『余今日到庭、不過爲表示好意于法院而已、』</p>
<p>▲原告會計之陳述經過推事以其答語離奇、當即往行詢問原告之會計主任、被告如何將判欵償還原告之經過、據稱被告于去年九月内、即用莊票將判欵四千餘兩、如數償還原告、該項莊票早經兌現、被告所提出之收據、即原告收到該欵後所出、被告所未出之貨物、亦已返還、</p>
<p>▲律師有欺朦法院嫌欵推事以其所供與勃朗律師自去年九月以來于歷次開庭時所陳者完全相反、殊覺詫異、正欲向該律歸發問時、該律師自知其陳述虚僞無可掩飾、忽起立曰（）『此點敝律師已于前次開庭時向鈞院陳明、』推事當答曰、『據本院所知、貴律師以前之陳述、完全與此不同、有本案之律錄爲證、貴律師殆有意欺朦法院、否則其頭腦之不清、亦何至于此、』</p>
<p>▲英領竟當庭大施攻擊斯時英領赫勃脫對于推事之言論、大施攻擊、并力爲該律師辯護、因推事未與理論、遂囑該律師提出抗議、該律師聞言後、即離座外出、英領與原告遂相繼退庭、而推事則仍繼續審理他案、聞法院方面對于此事、正在謀對付辦法、</p>

<h3>一得之言</h3>
<p>— 龍</p>
<p>情人口上的『吾愛』。等於强鄰口上的『親善』都是没有把握的。</p>
<p>中國人壞在於吃着上。皆摹仿外國人。而於事業上。反處處落後。所以國弱民困。年年受辱。</p>
<p>社會上不少進賬越多虧空越大的人。都因場面要緊。不遑儉約。他的債額。比進賬小的。起碼要大十倍以上。</p>
<p>一個窮人。如接連向三個富翁各貸不成。他一定能痛改前非。勤克儉。因爲他們陰沉的臉皮。譏諷的語氣。可使他發憤有餘了。</p>
<p>氣量狹窄的朋友。只可看看自由談。不可讀國際要聞。因爲常有辱國喪權的記載。直射尊目。即不至氣穿肚皮。也要氣出病來。</p>

<h3>革命元老黃河順氏</h3>
<p>— 璧人</p>
<p>革命老黃福。字河順。與孫總理爲莫逆交。當民國紀元前一年。革命軍復起。謀倒清室。而解我漢民族之痛苦。時河順居於澳門。得中山先生密旨。遂　夜集合兩廣山中健兒。預備在廣起義。不數日。竟得三萬之衆。乃發難焉。與兩廣總督岑春煊血戰三月之久。始平兩粤。　　會清廷遣使議和。中山先生爲臨時大總统。河順不以平粤爲功。呈書引退。雖經中山先生屢命出仕。而河順終辭而不就。及中山先生北上開國民會議。河順亦跟隨來滬。惟未北上耳。</p>
<p>河順今已七十餘歲。毫無衰頽之態。精神矍鑠如故。惟家境殊困。日用所出。均賴其妻之下指焉。然彼雖貧。每日早午均到北四川路會元茶樓品敬。洋洋自得。間有談及革命事者。彼必離座而去。至論他事。則口若懸河。滔滔不絶。若河順先生者。誠可風矣。</p>
<h3>聽胡先生演講</h3>

<p>三朋九日。上海青年會學術演講會。在青年會舉行第一次演講。講員爲胡適之博士。其學術理論。夙爲人所欽敬。是日聽講者逹八百餘人。因會塲不在。致無隙地。先由某君致詞。再三道歉。請來賓嚴守會塲秩序。勿以擁擠感受不快而影響靜穆。最後更請冠帽者一例除下。免出外傷風受寒。語頗滑稽。耐人尋味。　　胡先生起立。衆大鼓掌。講題爲『從新文藝觀察今日中國的思潮。』歷時一點二十分。茲記其大略如下『在二百萬人口衆多的上海。而無良好的學術研究會圖書館。以及劇塲戲院。提高民衆之思想。中</p>
<h3>常識拾零</h3>
<p>有關係的律跡和戚友通信處。切勿任意抛入字纸籭中。要防收字纸的收了去。落在歹人之手。貽害無窮。所以寗可用火焚化。以免後患。</p>
<p>買罐頭食品要到大店家去。因爲他們銷路暢旺。貨色新鮮。如果到小店家去。保你容易買到隔宿貨。這件事我曾經上過當的。</p>
<p>到小菜楊去買菜蔬。如果忘記帶秤。切勿假手小販。可找一位飯司務。托他代秤。那麽要便宜不少。</p>
<p>中途遇雨。可向大商店裏一跑。買一件價廉物美的家常用品。儘可躱一個痛快。他如商務印書館的陳列所。到是很好的避雨場所。而且還有書看。</p>
<p>國人之思想。向是『不思想的思想。』古人之崇拜禹湯文武周公孔子。而現代學者竭力鼓吹馬克思。列寗。或克魯泡特金。一倡百和。無澈底研究與充分之了解。亦不過舉以代禹湯文武周孔而已。中國人最大之病。即以耳代目。無實在眼光。深入透視。加以思想。惟隨多數人之是非爲是非。其心之感學。猶如鏡之鑑人物。見美者即美矣。醜者即醜矣。麻子即麻子矣。不加以思想或研究。問其究竟。於是敎會學校。必文化侵略也。傅敎之士。必宗敎侵略也。資本家必剝削工人也。不問其傅敎者資本者是否個個如此。畫幾張符。念幾句咒。打倒打倒。一呼百應。不論何種情形。概以畫符念咒攏統了之。美國福特非特不以馬克思之資本主義爲然。反减短工人工作時間。增加工資。售價仍得低廉。福特仍獲厚利。爲他人所不及。即因其思想超過他人之故。今中國治新文學者。每舉一二抽象名詞。以代表整個的問題。不問其國家社會之環境。人民之風俗。史地之關係。攏統包括。含糊過去。而盲目者盲從。叩其所以。咸瞠目不能答。例如康梁輩議新政。力學歐西。以爲無一非是。而未睱考其所以爲是。廢科舉。開學堂。以爲有學堂後不必有科舉。不知學校爲造就人材之處。而科舉爲選用人材之地。足見考試制之不可廢。今學子有大中各學文憑。碩士博士頭銜。倘無權貴之親友。不能得一位置。造成不良的狀况。學者對於一事一物。很少加以『思想的思想』。反覆考據引證。開闢新途徑。例如中國女子的纏足的惡習。流傅了千年。而千年中間。反對的人不满半打。文人才子。反以爲三寸金蓮。步步動人。爲美爲出色。甚至詠之詩歌。可見中國人之思想。都以多數人之贊同或反對爲標準。一盲前導。衆盲後隨。至今依然如此。所以很希望大家觀認清楚。自已認定是非。不要跟人瞎跑。</p>
<p>先生演詞清晣。亦莊亦諧。滑稽處閧堂大笑。惜不能一一錄出也。</p>
<h3>喫的問題</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>德國生理學博士利嘉氏。歐戰時曾參列戎行。一嘗硝煙彈雨生活。擊尸骸遍野。肝腦塗地之慘遂惻然而動仁者之心。乃著『非戰論』一書。傅誦於世。并繼續以學理推究人類之好戰與殘殺。苦不得其肯　。近頃忽恍然有悟。於柏林生物學社演講。謂人類人之好戰與殘殺。實關係於食牛肉與飲牛乳。西方之人。無不藉牛肉牛乳以爲滋養要品。牛善鬥。往往同類相殘。人類食其肉而飲其乳。則人之性日以離。牛之性日以即。歲積年累。子孫繼遞而不自覺。於是祥靄之氣。一變而爲戰禍之雲。氤氲鬰結。世無寧時。非弱國爲强國鍄呑。即小邦爲大邦蠶食。人民之死亡。不可以數計。其慘酷有不忍言者。故欲免世界戰爭。宜廢止食牛肉與飲牛乳。以恢復人之本性。一時聽者。無不爲之感動。由社員组織。爲不食牛肉大宣傅。響應者頗衆。此種聲浪。不久將傅徧於東西大陸。斯眞人類之福音也。吾友許兆鴻。自柏林郵書見告。語當非虚。因誌之。以爲自由談資料。</p>
<h3>記蝨蟹</h3>
<p>— 妍千</p>
<p>蝨。産閘港至五庫一段黃浦中。春初日暖始出。爲期至暂。一交清明。便無有矣。其大僅如俗語所謂砂殻子之小錢。故名蝨也。</p>
<p>漁人於潮未上時。撒巨網於浦底。待潮落起網。即得蝨蟹無數。初上市。每斤需價千文以上。蓋亦一時珍饌云。</p>
<p>食法甚奇妙。先用小臼搗之成泥漿。隨盛稀布製成之袋中。瀝出其汁。然後調鴨蛋中。煎爲蟹糊蛋皮食之於此所以必曰鴨蛋者。以鴨蛋質較靱。煎蛋皮實比鷄蛋爲佳也。</p>
<p>其泥漿經初瀝後。尚可兩度入水瀝之。瀝出之汁。可以煑湯。所謂蟹糊湯者是也。此汁瀝出時甚混濁。不堪逼視。迨湯煑成。則蟹質凝結成糊。而湯極清矣。</p>
<p>又有一食法。則宜於下酒者。法先將蝨蟹洗凈。用食鹽略漬之。再經一度冲洗。然後浸諸陳酒與上等醬油中。過半日。即可食。食時再加薑末葱花拌和。嚼其殻而咽其汁。實别有風味。</p>
<p>最後尚有兩語爲讀者告。如得蝨蟹。於製饌時。務須用重量之解腥和味品。否則恐不免怨蟹徒有其名耳。其次。則除前述兩種食法外。正不妨各出其心裁。爲更美之調製。固不必拘於成法也。</p>
<h3>南洋游記（五）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>關吏搜查甚廠。人口稅極重。而出口稅甚輕。法國貨人口往往無稅。此可知殖知地之利益矣。關於書報文字如有不利於法國者。人物均扣留重罰。而即無關係之文字。一時審查不清楚。人即不得自由。故行者均不敢帶書籍。只科學敎書可帶耳。但昔曾禁三民主義。今亦不禁矣。</p>
<p>未到埠前。即有警察來騐護照。須騐明方准上岸。三等以上須有護照。四等爲工人不必要。然工商人上岸。須納人頭稅。每人每月三元一年三四十至五六十不等。其美好者須多納。謂之優待云。女人或云止納數元。或云不須納。未知其詳。小孩十六歲以下不納云。我國人對此事。言之人人痛心。謂爲外交之失敗。相對嘆息而已。同船來之工人。有男女有帶小孩。投外國覓食一面忿怨。一面仍須依人門户求生活。等於猶太人而已。最難堪者。法對日本人則無稅。惟對華人耳對安南人亦每人每年稅六七元云。</p>
<p>碼頭近處道路。塵土飛空。似吾南京。遠不如黃浦江。大橋構造頗好。略似吾上海之外擺渡橋矣。江中船不少。多黑而舊。似廣東之船。使船者有土人。多赤背光頭於烈日中。過橋到西貢車棧。乘電車到堤岸。頭等一角。三等七分。電車客人均有座位。不似上海日本之擁擠。查票者有法人土人華人。往來如梭甚異上海電車賣票之糢糊。或揩油也。司車爲爲安南人態度安閒文雅。絶不似上海電車中賣票者。毫不加以敎育。對客人出口亂駡回憶中國電車以天津爲規矩。北京次之。上海最下。純成洋奴式。而且在安南人下矣。安南電車管理人有日本之風。其賣票與吾國異。每一二里均有小房賣電車票。其票窗爲小洞。方三四寸。必先買賣乃上車。我與陳君一次急行。陳不待買賣。一躍而上。於是兩人罰洋一解（此間無小洋）余曰此又吃不知之虧。所以知最可貴矣。</p>

<p>昨日本埠證劵市塲各債趨勢、以市上買氣閒散、賣户活動、雖零户補進者不寂、但與賣氣相較、則相去懸殊、故各債均繼續下跌、關稅跌勢最勁、期貨約跌一元三角、現貨下降幾逹二元、整六及九六亦各跌半元左右、其他除續二五立定外、其他僅小數角、至各債期現貨市况、現貨袛開出七千元、期貨依然五旺、上午成交四百五十餘萬元、後市五百二十五萬元、合計九百八十餘萬元、内關稅最盛、佔額在四百八十萬元以上、續捲約二百萬元、其他均不及前、善後約百二十萬元、整六計七十餘萬元、續大九六各四十餘萬、七年金副仍極清云、</p>

<h3>棉市隨美棉上漲</h3>
<p>棉市轉漲、但實銷依然暗淡、不過美棉忽漲、致買氣挺拔漢帮加碼、塲内形勢又見乾燥、故市面上漲各路來源仍缺、前途仍難預卜也</p>
<p>期棉回漲三錢半漢標前市開盤市氣平澹、因有大户賣加出碼各月祗漲五分至一錢、漢帮繼續購進、午後市氣驟緊預料美棉仍有漲風買風忽熾、各月漲二三錢、全日成交统計三萬二千三百擔茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>英日恊謀壟斷世界棉貨市塲</h3>
<p>印度棉布關稅似爲成敗之重心</p>
<p>英日兩國棉業者之竸爭益見劇烈、大阪英領事巴斯克克密司氏、向日本棉花會社副社長山田穆氏、提出英日棉業者互分市塲、恊定售價、並以貨之種類劃分營業、藉免竸爭而致無謂之損失日人方面對此間題極爲注意雖尚未有具體的表示、然對比主旨則咸表　同此事關係於我國棉業極大、茲將雙方情形分誌如下、以明其内容、巴氏之提案其目的爲緩和英日棉業之世界市場竸爭、以圖棉業界之安定、其内容尚守秘密、據探聞爲下列三要點（一）『棉製品販賣區域之恊定』爲避免中國印度南洋非洲近東等地英日棉貨販賣上之混戰、宜恊定彼此區域、各不相犯（二）『販賣價格之恊定』爲避免英日棉貨在各市塲竸爭而致原價採算之損失、對於重要製品宜恊定販買價格、（三）『輸出製品之質恊定』</p>
<p>兩國各估計海外市塲之需要、而定輸出貨品之種類以免市塲存貨增加、引起市價之低落云、英國棉業者　此恊謀策劃已久、其遠因無非勞動者勢力盛旺、致生産費騰昂、能率减退、而日本棉貨不僅有獨霸太平洋之勢、且對於近東等地亦大展其勢力、英國棉業大受影響至近因則爲最近日本棉業團體又積極的講求輸出振興策、兩國海外市塲之竸爭、益形劇烈也、此次巴氏之提出、初不過爲私人窺探今則漸爲公衆問題矣、據巴氏曾發表如次之談話、略謂此問題進行、極爲秘密、已諮詢許多棉業關係者之意旨英日棉業衹顧竸爭、决非雙方之利益、此爲明顯之事實、如能保持恊調則雙方均有利益故棉業實有世界恊調之要、其他事業如海運等亦復如此、至於恊調之具體方案、則由雙方實際家恊商之可也、此項恊調、雖不無多少困難、然亦非不可能之事實云</p>
<p>日本棉業者對此問題已引起重大之注意雖無具體表示、然據一般有關係者、有如下之意見、略謂防止由棉製品之激烈竸爭而生之損失與浪費、共謀棉業之國際的共榮、此種精神、最值吾人歡迎、毫無拒絶的理由、惟防止無益竸爭之實際手段不能不感覺不少之困難販賣區域價格品質之恊定問題、抽象的觀察似屬可能、如作實現的問題研究極感困難、如以國際的交誼爲基礎以公開的態度爲精神、用其他手段進行恊調實現或有可望又以公明之精神、先以解决印棉布開稅問題着手、則英日棉業之利、當必甚大云、更據日本棉業界某有力者之觀察、謂日本對此國際友誼提案、自樂予接受、惟如何處置頗費研究耳、其大體觀測對於（一）販賣區域之恊定其實現未必如何困難、例如中國印度南洋之市塲歸日本非近東歡羅巴等處則歸英國、惟恊定不以僅依目前之輸出爲比率、須將日本棉業界準備向世界市塲供給之輸出量算估加入、（二）則以兩國採算相違與技術之差異、頗難恊定云云</p>
<p>觀於日人之主張對於此項問題、大都表示贊同、然以印度增加進口棉布關稅予日本以絶大打擊、故目前日本方面以解决印度關稅爲此項恊調進行第一着、前途成敗此時尚難逆料也、</p>
<h3>絲茶黃白廠經銷清價平</h3>

<h3>南北貨湘蓮銷滯轉跌</h3>
<p>湘蓮近以走塲呆滯、市勢平疲、逐步轉跌、較之前市、已小三兩許漢口現市亦疲、據函息高莊不上念兩、次之十九兩、此間行存約有二千件、各帮僅有零星交易、昨市售盤、湘潭蓮爲三十七八兩衡州饒州蓮爲三十六兩左右、常德蓮三十兩、白蓮近亦回小、昨售三十四兩、以趨勢觀之、後市尚防再鬆、</p>
<h3>五金王金暢銷北帮</h3>

<h3>糖市粗砂白市又頽落</h3>
<p>跌價五分··需要仍靜</p>

<h3>煤炭焦炭售價大漲</h3>
<p>本埠各種焦炭斷檔幾逾兩月、久無市面、而用户方面需要頗急、日前大阪棧由某煤號新到小河焦二百餘噸、售價每噸竟漲起五兩有餘、查是項焦炭、去年售價、每噸僅十四兩五錢、昨日開盤、每噸　十九南五錢云、</p>

<h3>Signing of the Sino-Japanese Tariff Draft Agreement</h3>
<p>Shigemitsu arrived in Beijing yesterday morning and held continuous consultations with Wang Zhengting and Song Ziwen.</p>
<p>The draft agreement was signed by both plenipotentiaries at 6:30 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Shigemitsu, the Japanese representative in Nanjing, along with Counselor Yokotake and Secretary Horiuchi, arrived in Beijing at 7 AM on the 12th. At 10 AM, they went to the official residence of Wang Zhengting to discuss the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement with Wang Zhengting, Song Ziwen, and Xu Mo. They revised the wording of the agreed-upon articles one by one and dispersed at 11:30 AM. At 5 PM, Shigemitsu returned to the official residence to meet with Wang Zhengting. Wang served as the plenipotentiary representative of China, and Shigemitsu served as the Japanese representative. They signed the draft Sino-Japanese tariff agreement at the official residence at 6:30 PM. The agreement consisted of five articles, with the following content: (1) The two contracting countries, in order to meet the needs of both countries' national conditions, should have full power to formulate national tariff regulations, and the principle of complete tariff autonomy is recognized. Before the establishment of a new Sino-Japanese commercial treaty, the provisions of this principle shall be an effective measure. (2) The people of both countries shall abide by the above principles. Neither contracting country shall levy higher or different tariffs, inland taxes, or any taxes on goods transported from its territory or possessions to the territory of the other contracting country than those paid by its own people or the people of any country. (3) The Chinese government is responsible for abolishing likin before implementing national tariff regulations. (4) The Chinese and Japanese governments, in view of the special relationship between the peoples of both countries in commerce and trade, stipulate mutually beneficial items and types of goods and tax rates in a detailed attached document. (5) The Chinese and Japanese governments, in order to clear debts, are responsible for ensuring that the income from tariff regulations is used to secure the repayment of various loans. The above is the general content of the formal articles. It is heard that there are four additional attachments, which specify in detail the names of mutually beneficial goods and tax rates. It is also heard that the draft Sino-Japanese tariff agreement signed today was written in three languages: Chinese, English, and Japanese. In case of any ambiguity in the interpretation of the articles in the future, the English version shall prevail. After the signing, Shigemitsu telegraphed Japan.</p>
<p>The government will report, and Wang Zhengting will also report to the Central Political Council. After approval by both governments, the official signing will take about one month. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: After Shigemitsu, the acting Japanese minister, provisionally signed the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement, he returned to the Japanese consulate and said, "Today happens to be the fifth anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death, so the date of the agreement was changed to the 11th. The agreement document must be published after both parties have obtained government approval. If it is not approved, it will not be published. There was no specific discussion today regarding the continued negotiation of outstanding cases. In the future, there will be opportunities to negotiate in Nanjing or Shanghai. In short, a heavy burden has been lifted." (12th Telecommunication Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: At 5:10 PM, Shigemitsu, the acting Japanese minister, accompanied by Yokotake, the commercial counselor, and Horiuchi, the secretary, left the Japanese consulate for the residence of Foreign Minister Wang. Foreign Minister Wang, Finance Minister Song, and Xu Mo greeted them at the door and led them to the old room where Foreign Minister Wang and Minister Aizawa had resolved the Jinan Incident.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Political Situation in Britain, France, and Germany</h3>
<p>Today, the world's financial difficulties are mixed with the problem of worker unemployment, forming the world's most difficult problem, the impact of which is enough to shake the political situation. For today, no matter who it is, those who are at the brunt of this problem, their response policies cannot satisfy all parties. If Party A is satisfied, Party B will rise up to attack. If Party B is satisfied, Parties C and D will rise up in opposition. In attack and opposition, even if not used as a tool for partisan political struggle, the government's methods will inevitably be criticized as inadequate and its response as incompetent. Thus, the government is increasingly in a predicament, and the political situation becomes unstable as a result. Let's take the news received today as an example.</p>
<p>The British House of Commons passed the Conservative Party's proposed coal mine amendment by 282 votes to 274. The government failed, and there were wild cries from the seats for the cabinet to resign. Prime Minister MacDonald anticipates that the opposition party will launch an impeachment.</p>
<p>The French Parliament passed the Communist Party's proposed budget amendment by 302 votes to 255. Although this vote did not raise the issue of confidence, the cabinet has been greatly hit.</p>
<p>The German Reichstag passed the second reading of the Young Plan by 251 votes to 174. It is expected that the President intends to dissolve the parliament, but it still depends on the results of the National People's Party's general meeting. If the meeting does not approve the government's financial plan, then a cabinet crisis is inevitable.</p>
<p>The so-called coal mine case in Britain, the budget case in France, and the Young Plan case in Germany are all closely related to the issues of finance and unemployment. On the same day, in the Polish Parliament, the Socialist Party proposed a motion of no confidence in the Minister of Labor, and the cabinet is already in turmoil. Although the reasons for this case are not detailed, judging from Poland's financial situation, it must be no different. In addition to these countries, the US Congress, with too many unemployed workers and no government solutions, plans to raise questions. The Japanese new parliament has also begun, and opposition members are paying close attention to the issues of industrial decline and unemployment relief. It can be seen that the world's attention will be focused on this most difficult problem to solve, and the fate of the governments of various countries is tied to how they respond to the problem. The only economic policy that the great powers have relied on in diplomacy to replace force is sometimes exhausted when it returns to the country.</p>
<h3>Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams</h3>
<p>After being seated, both parties read the English agreement, making final comparisons. Shigemitsu signed first, followed by Foreign Minister Wang, at 5:50 PM. Since 1922, the Japanese side has changed four ministers and encountered many difficulties. The revision of the Sino-Japanese trade treaty, which has not been resolved until today, has now completed the first chapter. The plenipotentiaries of both countries raised champagne glasses to celebrate. It is hoped that the consular jurisdiction issue in the second chapter of the revised trade treaty, which is to be negotiated, can also proceed as smoothly as the tariff negotiations. At 6:10 PM, Acting Minister Shigemitsu happily left Wang's residence in a harmonious atmosphere. (12th Telecommunication Agency Dispatch)</p>

Because today is the anniversary of the Premier's death, only tea and snacks were prepared. At 7:10 PM, Dan Chuxu's warship, escorted by Hai Rong, sailed into Jiaoshan Gate. The Xiangshan cannons inquired with light signals. The answer was that the time was too rushed and could not stop the wheels, so it sailed straight west.

<p>Gandhi Starts Resistance March</p>
<p>Volunteers Continue to be Recruited</p>
<p>Reuters, Ahmedabad, 12th: Gandhi, as previously stated, today personally led the first non-violent resistance volunteers and began his 100-mile journey to Camp Bay.</p>
<p>Reuters, Ahmedabad, 11th: On the eve of beginning the non-violent resistance march, Gandhi addressed the crowd, saying that those who engage in non-violent resistance, in addition to disregarding the salt law and making their own salt, must also transport and sell the salt without paying taxes. Those with courage can refuse to pay taxes. The people of Gujarat should continue their plan to go to Jelarapuur to obtain salt from the sea and maintain the doctrine of non-violent resistance. Even if he and his comrades are arrested, the Indian people must maintain peace and carry out the instructions of the Standing Committee of the National Congress. If they do not abandon the truth, they will never fail. Gandhi then prayed for the success of tomorrow's struggle. According to a telegram from Sura, some National Party officials have gone to Jelarapuur to prepare for the arrival of non-violent resistance volunteers. Last night, it was widely rumored that the authorities would arrest Gandhi immediately, and the whole city was shocked. About a thousand people watched Gandhi's "Xingdao Academy" outside the door all night. The academy has a female picket team to protect it. At dawn, a large number of Indians went to Gandhi's Fudao Academy to watch the non-violent resistance volunteers leave. After Gandhi performed morning prayers, he said goodbye to the sick people in the Fudao Academy. During the past week, 14 children have suffered from smallpox and have been admitted for treatment. Three of them have died, and the rest are gradually recovering. A total of 160 people live in the institute. Gandhi personally led the vanguard of 79 volunteers, three in a row, each holding a stick and a cloth bag containing absolutely necessary daily necessities. The front guide was 16 students from the National University run by Gandhi in Gujarat, wearing a deep yellow symbol that Indians regard as auspicious. Hundreds of people lined up behind them. At that time, the police paid attention to guiding the traffic and did not interfere at all, so there was no disturbance. Along the way, Gandhi's team had several places decorated with colorful flags to show their admiration. The team will double its efforts to reach the Sabarmati River today.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 12th: Gandhi's war of independence has already begun, so all organizations related to the All India National Congress are now doing their best to recruit volunteers and engage in non-violent resistance. The "War Affairs Department" of the Bombay Provincial Congress Committee has now begun to recruit workers, as well as non-violent resistance funds, and advised Bombay to first set an example in this "war to the end" as a model for the whole of India. Volunteers are now divided into three categories: (1) "Iron Army", those who are prepared to immediately engage in non-violent resistance; (2) "Reserve Team", those who are prepared to take over when the Iron Army loses its combat power; (3) "Miscellaneous Team", those who specialize in participating in demonstrations. Gandhi published an article in the Young India Weekly, stating that he was shocked by Lord Irwin's reply to his ultimatum, and that Irwin's country, which he represented, was unyielding and difficult to repent, and would only listen to physical strength. He continued to refer to the section in which the governor said that he would destroy the law and endanger public security, saying that the only law known to the people of the country was the will of the British rulers, and that the only public security known was the public prison. India has now become a huge prison. At the end, he said, I deny this kind of law, and I regard it as my sacred duty to break the sad monotony of compulsory public security that blocks the heart of the people of the country.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 12th: This afternoon, the newspapers reported that Indian Nationalist Party members residing in Japan (including Bossi, who attempted to assassinate the then Indian Governor 17 years ago) gathered in Kamakura to celebrate Gandhi's start of non-violent resistance movement, and raised the Indian national flag and the Min Party flag, intending to take it down only after the movement has achieved its goal. According to Sun Yat-sen, before the uprising in his country, he also gathered his party members in Kamakura to hold a meeting.</p>
<p>Reuters, Ahmedabad, 12th: After three children in Gandhi's FuDao Academy died of smallpox last week, Gandhi's friends strongly urged everyone in the FuDao Academy to be vaccinated to prevent the spread of the disease. Gandhi has always been opposed to vaccination. After praying today, he still said that he was opposed to vaccination as before. In his view, this move is the same as eating beef. He would not stop those who want to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 12th: The Bombay government is now closely consulting with the central government on the current situation, as the current situation can be regarded as related to the whole of India to some extent. It is heard that two companies of British troops and one regiment of Indian troops are now stationed in Ahmedabad.</p>
<p>Reuters, Ahmedabad, 12th: When Gandhi's volunteer team passed the border of Ahmedabad, the number decreased greatly, and many escorts returned home one after another. At 10:30 this morning, the team arrived at Asrali, where a hundred villagers greeted them with flags, flowers and music.

<p>Reuters, India Pula, 11th: The 11th Sikh Regiment (Indian Standing Army) is scheduled to depart for Baloda on March 17th, replacing the 4th Bombay Marine Corps (Indian Territorial Army). The team was recruited and compiled in Baloda and will now be disbanded. It should be noted that Baloda is on the main road for Gandhi's non-violent resistance volunteers to reach the beach. Reuters, London, 12th: The Indian Affairs Department announced that the disbandment of the 4th Bombay Marine Corps was due to the excessive number of troops. Replacing it with the 11th Sikh Regiment is a matter of pre-determined procedure.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 12th: Two thousand students held a demonstration here today and clashed with the police. Seven students were injured and all were admitted to the hospital. This demonstration was one of several demonstrations organized by the All India National Congress supporters in Bombay and the surrounding countryside. The commander of the militia, Taister, personally came to the scene and ordered the release of one of the children who had been arrested, and ordered that a deposit of seventy rupees be paid. Taister said that he had not ordered anyone to be arrested so far, but if the riots continued, he would have no choice but to take this measure. In today's demonstration, national volunteers marched in review, and the crowd paraded through the major streets. Today's conflict between the students and the police was caused by the police arresting a student, and the crowd followed them to the police station, shouting "Shameful". The crowd poured into the police station square and was forced to withdraw by the police. Not long after, Taister came to the scene and ordered the release of the student.</p>
<h3>Naval Conference Sees Progress</h3>
<p>Initial Decisions</p>
<p>Telecommunication Agency, London, 11th: At the meeting of plenipotentiaries on the 11th, Stimsun proposed that aircraft carriers below 10,000 tons should be placed within the tonnage limit. The plenipotentiaries of Japan, France, Britain and Italy all expressed their approval. The first committee drafted detailed articles. This is the first decision made since the opening of the disarmament conference.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th: The meeting of chief delegates of all countries this evening has made some progress. The British Secretary of the Navy verbally reported the agenda of the first committee, saying that an agreement has been reached in substance on the issue of special warships. Most of the matters considered by the first committee, except for the submarine issue, will be submitted to the meeting of chief delegates of all countries to be held on Thursday.</p>
<p>Statement from the US Representative</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th: The US representative at the naval conference stated that the United States cannot participate in a Mediterranean Locarno Treaty to guarantee France's security in exchange for a reduction in France's tonnage. Not to mention the quid pro quo nature of this approach, the US representative believes that if the United States signs a consultation agreement, the United States may have no choice but to take other actions morally when France engages in war in the future, and not just consultation. American public opinion is very firm on this issue, and they would rather have the delegation abandon the entire Five-Power Treaty than be subject to this consultation obligation. It is heard that the British delegation has the same opinion as the US representative on the Mediterranean</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>The same opinion on the Mediterranean Locarno Treaty. The First Committee decided not to include existing special warships in the total tonnage, but this is only limited to the treaty period that can be produced by the conference, not a long time.</p>
<h3>Opening of the First Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>Telecommunication Agency, London, 11th: The First Committee on the 11th held a meeting at 2:00 PM and discussed for two hours. The agenda included important cases such as the classification standards of cruiser types and whether to add tonnage, as well as many other specialized matters. Therefore, many members from various countries attended. On the Japanese side, Chief Financial Officer Nagai and other plenipotentiaries, Anbo Sakonji, Toyota Nakamura, Sato Iwai, etc. attended. Regarding the issue of light cruiser special ships reported by the expert committee, those that have been internally determined will be recognized. The French proposal to add the tonnage of special ships to the amount held was withdrawn due to opposition from the other four countries. Regarding Japan's proposal to supplement five training ships of the same class, Plenipotentiary Nagai stated that he reserved the right to discuss it at another opportunity. The issue of seaplane support ships was generally recognized in the expert committee's report. Next, the motion entrusted by the meeting of chief plenipotentiaries was reviewed. Japan proposed that a non-construction zone should be set between the maximum and minimum limits of destroyers, and Plenipotentiary Nagai explained that the distinction between destroyers and light cruisers should be clear. Therefore, this proposal was submitted. The United Kingdom and the United States do not seem to agree. On the morning of the 12th, the opinions of various countries were gathered and reported to the meeting of chief plenipotentiaries. Next, the classification standard of cruiser types and whether to add displacement were discussed, that is, the issue of cruiser hull type restrictions. Plenipotentiary Nagai strongly advocated its necessity, and the United Kingdom agreed with it. France and the United States opposed it. Then, through the efforts of the United Kingdom, the entire venue unanimously recognized it in principle. However, the actual figures for the tonnage limit must be discussed at the meeting of chief plenipotentiaries.</p>
<h3>The Difficulties Between Japan and the United States</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 10th reported that Li Da visited Matsudaira this afternoon for two hours of talks, leaving at 5:00 PM. No progress was made in this meeting, but it is understood that there may be some motivation. As for the differences between Japan and the United States, there are two difficulties in reaching an agreement: (1) By 1936, the United States will have 15 10,000-ton cruisers, while Japan will have 12. This is difficult for Japan to accept. Even if Japan concedes and accepts this, what will be the construction deadline for the remaining three ships? (2) Whether to recognize the interchangeability of 8,000-ton cruisers and 6,000-ton cruisers. Given the current situation, it is extremely difficult for the two countries to reach an agreement on these two points, so pessimistic views are gaining strength.</p>
<h3>Japanese Delegation Meeting on Countermeasures</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 11th reported that Minister Matsudaira visited Minister Wakatsuki on the afternoon of the 11th to report on the content of his talks with U.S. Minister Li Da on the 10th. Subsequently, Ministers Nagai and Zaibei also rushed to participate, holding a four-minister meeting to discuss countermeasures against the United States and the attitude to be taken at the First Committee in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Problem of Light Cruiser Type Restrictions</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 11th reported that the important issue for the First Committee meeting on the afternoon of the 12th is the problem of light cruiser type restrictions. The Japanese side believes that if there are no restrictions on cruisers equipped with 6-inch guns, it will not only violate the spirit of disarmament but also risk inducing a construction competition. Therefore, it advocates a 7,500-ton limit. The United States, on the other hand, has always hoped to build large cruisers and opposes restrictions. At this meeting, the principle of majority rule will not be used. If one country objects, it cannot be established. Therefore, the problem of light cruiser type restrictions is likely to fail in the end.</p>
<p>British and French Special Committee Discuss Tonnage</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 11th reported that the British and French Special Committee discussed the numbers based on France's tonnage claims and planned to submit them to the plenary session on the afternoon of the 12th for discussion.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 11th reported that the top British naval officials want to resolve the issue between France and Italy by 1936, with France holding 550,000 tons and Italy holding 300,000 tons. The Italian side is paying close attention to this.</p>
<h3>British Conservative Party Demands Cabinet Resignation</h3>
<p>House of Commons Passes Bill Against Coal Production Tax</p>
<p>First Defeat Since the Labour Party Took Office</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 11th reported that during the review of the coal mine bill in the House of Commons today, the House rejected the Liberal Party's amendment with 272 votes against 242 votes. The Liberal Party advocated that the output of exported coal should be exempt from any restrictions. After this clause was rejected, the Labour Party cheered loudly. Subsequently, the Conservative Party proposed an amendment against the coal production tax to facilitate exports. The House passed it with 282 votes against 274 votes. The government failed, and the Conservative Party shouted "Resign!" The British Prime Minister claimed that he did not consider this amendment a major change, so he instructed the review committee to continue the case. He also said that the opposition leader, Baldwin, will have an opportunity to move for impeachment in two days. If the number of impeachment votes is large, the government can obey the resolution, he said.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 12th reported that the government's failure in the House of Commons last night was not significant. This was the first defeat since the Labour Party took office last June. However, the point of its defeat</p>
<p>is only an arbitrary clause in the review stage.</p>
<p>Before the vote in the House of Commons, it was known that the government did not consider this a matter of confidence. The Prime Minister's so-called opportunity for impeachment refers to the tax rate, which will occur on Thursday. At that time, the government can get the full support of the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 12th reported that all newspapers unanimously stated that as a result of the government's failure in the coal mine bill during the review stage last night, a general election will probably be held after the budget bill is completed. The government is often attacked by the joint efforts of the two opposition parties and is overwhelmed.</p>
<h3>German Parliament Passes the Young Plan</h3>
<p>Governor of the National Bank Has Been Elected</p>
<p>A National News Agency dispatch from Berlin on the 11th reported that the German Parliament passed the second reading of the Young Plan bill with 251 votes against 174 votes. Twenty-six people abstained. It is also reported that the German-Polish agreement's second reading also passed with 224 votes against 207 votes. Thirty people abstained. It is rumored that the Central Party was finally able to accept the solution to the national financial plan as a result of the party leader meeting with the President.</p>
<p>A National News Agency dispatch from Berlin on the 11th reported that after the German Parliament adjourned today, the Central Party spokesman, Brüning, announced the situation of his audience with the President. It is said that the President stated that he would submit the Young Plan to the National Assembly for final resolution if necessary. Therefore, the party voted in favor. It is also heard that the President once said that he is determined to use all the powers under the constitution to find ways to implement the government's financial plan. The current cabinet expects that these words contain the meaning of dissolving the parliament. However, the ultimate result will depend on the outcome of the National Party's national congress convened in Mannheim on March 20. If the congress decides to support the government's financial plan, the cabinet crisis can be avoided.</p>
<p>A National News Agency dispatch from Geneva on the 11th reported that the German representative, Schiff, declared that although Germany advocates radicalism regarding the general tariff truce, it is also prepared to support the French proposal because it contains many beneficial measures. All speakers at today's meeting agreed in principle to accept the French proposal as a basis for discussion. Only a few people had reservations, so the situation of the meeting has improved and is expected to not be in vain.</p>

<h3>English Channel Tunnel Project</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 11th reported that the report of the committee studying the English Channel Tunnel problem is expected to be published soon. The committee has considered the economic, engineering, and geographical aspects of this problem. It is heard that supporters of this move have not seen any insurmountable difficulties in any aspect that would hinder the construction of the tunnel. It is rumored that the committee advocates building a pilot tunnel under the strait first for testing, with a budget of £5 million. As for the construction of the tunnel itself, it should be done by private business, which will cost about £25 million. When this report is submitted to Parliament, the military aspects of this problem still need to be considered.</p>
<h3>British Troops in Shanghai Will Not Be Reduced for the Time Being</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 11th reported that the British Secretary of War replied to a member of Parliament in the House of Commons today, saying that there is currently no intention to reduce the troops stationed in Shanghai, but he cannot predict what will happen in the future.</p>

<p>A National News Agency dispatch from New York on the 11th reported that Foster, who was previously nominated as the Communist Party's presidential candidate, has been taken into custody by the court and will be interrogated on March 20.

<p>A National News Agency dispatch from Warsaw on the 11th reported that two motions of no confidence were suddenly proposed in the Polish parliament.

The Communist Party's budget amendment in the House of Representatives, with the support of the Socialist Party, passed with 320 votes against 255 votes. However, a vote of confidence was not proposed this time, so the cabinet does not have to resign. However, if it is repeatedly rejected like this, it will also seriously damage the cabinet's prestige.</p>

In the center of the stage was a respectful display of the Premier's portrait, with the couplet "The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades still need to work hard" on both sides. Military band and guest platforms were set up on the left and right sides of the stage.

<p>Congress Ceremony: (1) Opening, (2) Presidium takes its seats, (3) Raising the Party flag (4) Playing mourning music, (5) Singing the Party song, (6) Bowing three times to the Party and national flags and the Premier's portrait, (7) The chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will, (8) The whole venue bows their heads in silence for three minutes, (9) The chairman delivers the opening speech, (10) A representative of the Central Party Headquarters delivers a speech, (10) (1) A representative of the National Government delivers a speech (12) A representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters delivers a speech (13) A representative of the Municipal Government delivers a speech (14) A representative of mass organizations delivers a speech, (15) Free speech, (16) Calling slogans, (17) Playing mourning music (18) Photography, (19) Closing.</p>

Ye Chucang delivered the opening speech, followed by speeches by Jiao Yitang, a representative of the Central Committee, He Yingqin, a representative of the National Government, and representatives of the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and various groups. After the ceremony, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>In his speech, Chairman Ye Chucang briefly stated that the Premier had passed away for five years. During these five years, we lost the Father of the Nation and the mentor. Fortunately, our comrades have a deep understanding of the Premier's legacy and the Party's policies, and have worked hard to save our country and our people, so that the country and people of the Republic of China can obtain an independent, free, and equal position. Therefore, today's commemoration can be said to be of great value. Recalling five years ago, the Premier, with a spirit of great fearlessness, was within the scope of the Beijing warlords' feudal forces, hoping to use the power of edification to achieve the goal of peaceful unification, but unfortunately, his wish was not fulfilled, and he left us forever. When we commemorate the Premier today, we should not just be in form but should value the true spirit, continue the Premier's legacy, and eliminate all those who destroy peaceful unification and betray the Premier, in order to achieve true peaceful unification. The Premier's deathbed will had the seven words "Peaceful struggle to save China," which must be embraced and never forgotten with the power of the whole Party in order to achieve this goal. We should especially examine the work of our own Party and strive for construction and progress to comfort the Premier's spirit in heaven and to comfort the people's hunger and exhaustion.</p>
<p>In his speech, Jiao Yitang, a representative of the Central Party Headquarters, said, "Comrades and compatriots, today is the fifth anniversary of the Premier's passing. Recalling today five years ago, the Premier unfortunately passed away in Peiping. This is not only heartbreaking for comrades, but also mourned by the oppressed people of the world. In the past five years, our Party has inherited the Premier's legacy and removed all obstacles, from military government to constitutional government. During this period, if there are still obstacles to the development of the Three Principles of the People, the Central Committee will have to eradicate them, which should be sympathized with by those who uphold the doctrine. However, there are one or two rebellious people who have temporarily gone astray. The Central Committee has been lenient, and fortunately, the turmoil has now subsided. The resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, such as promoting education and implementing autonomy, how should we work hard to implement the resolutions? The Premier's deathbed will took peaceful struggle to save China as the training. Since we know that imperialism is harmful to people and communism hates people, only the Three Principles of the People love people. We should strive together to transform the current world of force into a world of culture, and then transform the world of culture into a world of art. This is the Premier's last goal. I hope my comrades work together to achieve the Premier's unfinished business."</p>
<p>In his speech, He Yingqin, a representative of the National Government, briefly stated that when commemorating the Premier today, we should first consider what the situation of our Party and country was like five years ago. At that time, only Guangzhou was the base of our Party, and the South Road of Guangdong was still occupied by Chen Jiongming and others. It was not until March 13 of that year that Chen was first defeated, and as a result of this victory, the East River was recovered. In the fourteenth year, the internal reactionaries of Guangdong were eliminated, and in the fifteenth year, the Northern Expedition was able to proceed. In the past five years, because all the officers and soldiers of our National Revolutionary Army believed in the Premier's Three Principles of the People and learned from the Premier's spirit of fearlessness, China was fortunately unified. However, in reality, the reactionary enemies and all feudal forces are still eager to move. If China wants to achieve freedom and equality,</p>

<h3>Continued Important News</h3>
<p>the goal, all Chinese people must unanimously believe in the Three Principles of the People and support the National Government. Therefore, in the future, we should still follow the spirit of five years ago and work hard to advance according to the principles and policies set by the Premier. Then all reactionary efforts can be eliminated soon, and the goal of freedom and equality can be achieved without difficulty. Today, commemorating the Premier, brothers, on behalf of the National Government, respectfully offer this meaning to comrades and compatriots across the country.</p>
<p>Sun Ke's Eulogy: On March 12 of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the day for commemorating the fifth anniversary of the Premier's passing, Sun Ke, Minister of Railways, led all his subordinates to pay tribute to the Premier's spirit, saying, "Alas, the revitalization of the railway administration and the teachings that the legacy instructed are like a net in the net, but due to the frequent internal conflicts, it is not easy to implement. Although I have exhausted my meager ability, I cannot implement even a hundredth of it. Every time I think of the lessons of the past, it is like a thorn in my back, and I try to lead my colleagues, daring not to be lazy for a moment, because I have never stopped thinking about how to comfort the spirit in heaven. Now that the new office has been established, my colleagues in the Ministry are deeply concerned about the difficulties of the country's progress and the urgency of the measures. What we should do is to increase our hard work to comfort the people's expectations and to repay the legacy of the country and our Premier. Mountains are high and waters are long, this ambition</p>
<p>will not change. Enjoy!"</p>

Repeat offenders will have their newspaper offices sealed. Fearing that such unreportable incidents may be unavoidable in the future, we hereby apologize to all reporters in advance and urge them to be cautious in their reporting. It is also decided that starting from the 3rd, all newspapers must submit their layouts to the Inspection Office for review before being allowed to print. The Jinpu Railway traffic has been suspended since the 28th of last month. The southbound No. 201 express train to Pingpu only went as far as Lianzhen before returning to Tianjin the next day. To maintain the railway bureau's revenue, the Tianjin office operates passenger trains nine times (southbound) and ten times (northbound) daily between Tianjin and Lianzhen, but there are few passengers and little revenue. Garrison Commander Fu Zuoyi telegraphed Chen Tiaoyuan, requesting permission for Jinpu trains to travel north to maintain transportation. Chen replied briefly, stating that he had no authority to interfere with train operations. He heard that the railway bureau was wary due to the constant passage of troops. Maintaining transportation is a matter of mutual sympathy, and he has instructed the railway bureau to handle the matter accordingly. However, according to railway bureau sources, northbound trains only go as far as Pingyuan, and southbound trains only go as far as Lianzhen. The Yellow River railway bridge is protected by two companies of military engineers from Shandong, and there is a garrison brigade headquarters in Dezhou, but no army. Fu Zuoyi's troops are concentrated between Cangzhou, Botou, and Lianzhen, camping near the stations. The vanguard is in Sangyuan, still twenty li away from Dezhou. As for restoring railway traffic, there is little hope for the time being. Over a hundred carriages and over a dozen locomotives on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway have been borrowed by the Shanxi army. The Beining Railway fears that troops will seize trains, and large locomotives have been recalled outside the Guan. Currently, only small locomotives from this railway and locomotives from the PingSui and PingHan railways are maintaining Beining transportation.</p>
<p>Yan Xishan appointed Xu Yongchang as the Commander-in-Chief of the Jinpu Railway and Fu Zuoyi as the Chief Commander. Fu's troops began heading south on February 25th. At 4 PM that afternoon, Sun Lanfeng, commander of the 256th Regiment of the 128th Brigade (Brigade Commander Bai Nuoqing) of the 43rd Division, led his entire regiment of over 1,700 men and over 30 horses from Hanjiashu to Cangzhou. At 6 AM on February 27th, Sun Chengwen, commander of the 255th Regiment of the 127th Brigade (Brigade Commander Ye Qijie) of the 43rd Division, led his entire regiment of over 1,600 men and over 20 horses from Yangcun to Botouzhen. At 1:30 PM, Bo Xin, commander of the 253rd Regiment of the same brigade, led his entire regiment from Yangcun to Botouzhen. At the same time, Chen Zhenlu, chief of staff of the brigade, also led over a hundred brigade officers and 92 boxes of hand grenades from Yangcun to Botouzhen at 4:30 PM. In addition, Li Shengda, commander of the 36th Division, sent Kang Shaotang, the ordnance chief of the 106th Brigade, to the Taiyuan headquarters to collect 100 boxes of mortar shells, 200 boxes of hand grenades, 18 pistols, 18 submachine guns with 40,000 rounds of ammunition, and 20,000 rounds of rifle ammunition. He arrived in Tianjin at 1:30 PM that afternoon. Li Pinzhou, captain of the 14th Platoon of the 43rd Division's Signal Corps, led his entire platoon and communication equipment from Tianjin to Cangzhou at 8 AM that morning. Bai Ruqing, commander of the 128th Brigade of the same division, led over a hundred brigade officers from Hanjiashu to Cangzhou at 4 AM that morning. At 6 AM on the 28th, Shen Lirui, captain of the 2nd Team of the Zhongshan armored train, led over 120 soldiers from Changxindian to Cangzhou. At 11 AM that morning, Zhou Pu, commander of the 6th Artillery Regiment, led Mi Zhenyu, commander of the 1st Battalion, along with over 500 soldiers, 135 boxes of artillery shells, 100 boxes of hand grenades, 135 horses, and 12 cannons from Shijiazhuang to Cangzhou. At 1:30 PM, He Chengpu, chief of staff of the 43rd Division, led officers from the eight departments of the division, along with the special service team, bicycle team, and two platoons of guards, from Tianjin to Cangzhou. At 4 PM, Li Weiyu, captain of the cavalry platoon of the 36th Division, led his entire platoon of soldiers and horses from Tianjin to Cangzhou. At 7 PM, Hu Pize, commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 6th Artillery Regiment, led his entire battalion of soldiers and 12 cannons, 1,520 artillery shells, and 140 horses from Shijiazhuang to Cangzhou. On March 1st, Yang Dongcai, commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 6th Artillery Regiment, led his entire battalion of officers and soldiers and 12 cannons, 184 horses, through Tianjin to Lianzhen at 12 PM. Zhao Pilian, the representative sent by Yan Xishan to the South, passed through Tianjin from Shanghai this afternoon to return to Bing to report. Also, Guo Chuntao came to Tianjin from Wugang and went to Ping to Bing today. The Garrison Headquarters sent Secretary Lin Dexi and two others to the Tianjin office of the Jinpu Railway to monitor everything and sent troops to monitor the railway's radio station. It is rumored that the Tianjin office of the Jinpu Railway will be changed to the Jinpu Railway Administration, but this is unlikely to happen in the near future. He Zhiguang, commander of the transport battalion of the 36th Division, led his entire battalion from Yangcun to Cangzhou at 10 AM on the 3rd.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned Shanxi troops are concentrated along the Jinpu Railway, with the same unit designations and organization as usual. It is rumored that the name "Army of the Republic of China" has not yet been adopted, and only an armband with blue background and white characters is added to the soldiers. (February 4th)</p>
<h3>Another Emergency on the South Bank of the Yongding River</h3>
<p>The Hebei Provincial Government Decides to Allocate Funds for Emergency Rescue</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: The emergency on the north bank of the Yongding River has already been reported in the previous news. Today, Wen Shouquan, Director of the Department of Construction, received another telegram from Feng Heming, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, reporting that the 26th section on the south bank also experienced an emergency on the 7th. Due to the impact of the transverse river, the submerged small embankments of the restoration project were submerged in the water, with a length of approximately 28 zhang. All the hanging willows were shaking. They are currently doing their best to protect it. The original telegram is as follows: 'To Wen Junjian, Director of the Department of Construction, it is reported by Wang Yongli and Hu Deji, section chiefs of the South Second Section, that at noon today, March 7th, the 26th section of this section was impacted by the transverse river, and the main current directly hit the embankment base, causing the submerged small embankments of the restoration project to be submerged in the water, with a length of 28 zhang. More than 20 hanging willows were lost before. They have been instructed to immediately roll oil and protect it. All the hanging willows are shaking. Urgently using hemp ropes to re-tie them to avoid loss. In addition to reporting the rescue situation by telegram at any time, this telegram is specially reported, etc. Based on this, the director plans to rush to the section to personally supervise the rescue to avoid any negligence. He immediately telegraphed the section chiefs to make arrangements according to the situation, and to do their best to rescue and protect the hanging willows and rolled oil. No matter what, there should be no slackness, causing delays. Feng Heming, Director of the Yongding River Affairs Bureau, kowtows to Yang (7th), not yet.</p>
<p>Wen Shouquan believes that the Yongding River has just thawed, and the embankments are frequently collapsing. When the peach blossom flood rises in the future, the harm will be unimaginable. He is in charge of river defense and cannot shirk his responsibility. Moreover, since the Yongding River is within Hebei Province, the province must make some preparations. He proposed at the provincial government committee meeting on the 6th that, on the one hand, he should quickly telegraph the central government to urge for funds, and on the other hand, the province should first raise more than 60,000 yuan to carry out key projects to ensure that the floods of last year will not be repeated today. It was decided to follow this plan. The funds will be advanced by the provincial government for 40,000 yuan, and the Department of Finance will quickly allocate it. The remaining 20,000 yuan should be raised by the Yongding River Project Fund Management Committee. It is reported that the Department of Construction's construction plan this time intends to use the Lugou Bridge to reduce the dam and divert the water into the Daqing River, so that the riverbed below Lugou Bridge will be dry, so that stone dams can be built and breaches can be blocked. Therefore, a diversion canal is excavated above Lugou Bridge, the keel is lowered, and a second dam is built. After the construction of the dam is completed, the upper opening of the diversion canal is opened to discharge water, and then the first dam is built to make the water flow into the Xiaoqing River, and then the work of blocking the opening and protecting the embankment is started. Yesterday, marine engineering experts were dispatched to survey the upper and lower reaches of the Yongding River in order to start construction immediately. The proposal of the Department of Construction is recorded as follows: 'According to Feng Heming, Director of the Yongding River Affairs Bureau, both the north and south banks of this river have been eroded by last year's flood, and they are in a state of disrepair. The incomplete embankment sections are precarious. The emergency work of the protruding and collapsing embankments of the old Second Section on the north bank and the swaying of the revetments have been reported. Detailed surveys of the incomplete situation of the banks have been carried out. If repairs are not carried out immediately, it is extremely dangerous. Now it is the time of the ice flood. The whole river is thawing. Large pieces of ice are flowing down, impacting and colliding, and eroding the embankment body. The river is meandering, and dangerous shoals are forming. Although the incomplete openings have dragon tail revetments, they may be washed away by the flood. If strict protection is not provided, if they collapse, the construction will be even more difficult, costing money and delaying work. The best plan now is to first make ice-breaking piles, carefully set them up on both sides of the opening according to the terrain, so that the flowing ice cannot touch the embankment body, and make a slow-flow sedimentation row outside the opening to reduce the water force, so as to maintain the original state of the opening. However, where the river meanders and bends, the current directly hits the embankment body, and the embankment root is easily washed away. It is necessary to make it tend to the water pool, bind the water with two embankments, and not harm the embankment. It is necessary to dig a diversion canal to straighten the waterway and make it flow down smoothly to be effective. The actual estimated cost of each project is a total of 62,786.81 yuan. I earnestly request that it be advanced immediately so that it can be started immediately to eliminate the huge disaster. After the large project funds are allocated, they will be deducted as the number and attached charts, etc. According to this, the Yongding River breach blocking project has been repeatedly submitted to the conference and telegraphed to the central government to raise funds. Because of the urgency of the water control post-disaster project, it was reported to the conference to first raise and advance the amount in full in the province. At present, the breach blocking fee has not been allocated on schedule, and the post-disaster project fee for water control has not been advanced in full. On the 4th, 5th, and 6th of this month, the director of the bureau repeatedly telegraphed that the remnant embankment of the 33rd section of the North Second Section was collapsing continuously, with a length of more than one zhang and a width of two or three chi, and the situation was extremely critical. At this time, the river is thawing, and the embankment body is collapsing frequently. What can be imagined when the peach blossom flood rises in the future? Shouquan is responsible for river defense and cannot shirk his responsibility. Seeing the situation with his own eyes, he is deeply worried. Based on the previous situation, considering that it is unlikely that the central government will allocate the breach blocking fee quickly, and that the post-disaster project fee for water control raised by the province is a large amount and cannot be handled at once, this time the bureau plans to select the most important projects to rush to do emergency work and rows of piles, cut bends and straighten them, and dig diversion canals, which are indeed emergency measures. The required project funds are a total of 62,786.81 yuan, which is not a large amount and is not difficult to raise. It is proposed to order the Department of Finance to advance the amount in full in the shortest possible time, and return it after the central government determines the breach fee, in order to protect the dangerous works and maintain the people's lives. Is it feasible? The reason is to check back the charts and submit them for public decision.'</p>
<h3>Construction of the Shaoping Section of the Yuehan Railway Will Begin</h3>
<p>The Roadbed from Shaozhou to Laohulan Has Been Leveled</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways Allocates 400,000 Yuan to Start the Project First</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Yuehan Railway Administration recently received a formal order from the Ministry of Railways, renaming it the Yuehan Railway Guangshao Section Administration. After receiving the order, the administration officially used its seal yesterday (7th) and sent letters to various agencies for notification. It is reported that the administration is actively surveying the line from Shaozhou to Pingshi in order to start construction as soon as possible. Chen Bozhuang, Chairman of the Yuehan Railway Committee, recently completed the task and specially accompanied Chen Yanwen, Director of the Yuehan Railway Guangshao Section Administration, and Zhuo Kangcheng, Director of the Zhushao Section Engineering Bureau, leading a team of engineers, to Shaozhou by car on the 2nd, and then went to inspect the project along the line. They arrived in Shaozhou at about 4 PM that afternoon. On the 3rd, they departed from Shaozhou and inspected places such as Libutou, Gaolian Village, and Yangxi. They arrived in Lechang at 5 PM on the 3rd. On the 4th, they went to Pingshi from Lechang. They arrived at Laohukou at 9 AM and first inspected the mountain cave there. This cave is extremely dangerous and steep. The Shaoping line passes through it, and the engineering is quite large. It is currently being tunneled. The line south of the cave is 500 feet long and has been completed, allowing cars to pass through. It is expected that when the tunneling project is completed, there will be no major obstacles to the line north of the cave to Pingshi. If the track laying project from Shaozhou to Laohukou is started next month, the tunneling project will be completed, and the track of this section will also be completed. Further north from Laohukou, the roadbed along the way is relatively flat. They patrolled to Paotaiwan, which is about 30 miles away from Pingshi. There is a small river here. They immediately hired a folk boat and returned to Laohukou, where they transferred to a long-distance bus back to Shaoguan. The Shaoping Road project has been scheduled to open for bidding on the 27th of this month. Many construction companies are preparing to go to bid for construction. After the Chairman and Director and others completed the inspection, they took the Yuehan train back to the province on the 5th. In addition to reporting the inspection to the Ministry of Railways, they rushed to handle the construction matters. It is reported that the start-up fee of 400,000 yuan has been allocated and remitted by the Ministry of Railways as the first month's expenses. In the future, the ministry will allocate 200,000 yuan per month to provide a steady stream of assistance. The special party department of the road feared that the central government would allocate two-thirds of the Gengkuan road money for other purposes. They telegraphed Beijing to fight for it. Yesterday, the Ministry of Railways had a reply telegram stating that the road money would never be changed. The original telegram is as follows: 'To the Yuehan Railway Bureau South Section Party Affairs Steering Committee, I have received the telegram. The Yuehan Road is a hub for connecting north-south traffic and is very important. The construction must not be delayed. The central government has discussed and decided to allocate two-thirds of the British Gengkuan and complete it within a time limit. The ministry's responsibility lies in this and has been actively proceeding. There is no reason to change it midway. Thank you for your warm assistance. I am especially grateful for your friendship. The Ministry of Railways.' (March 8th)</p>
<h3>Liu Heding's Troops Temporarily Stationed in Quanzhou</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: After the Fujian Incident occurred and the five provincial committee members were arrested, the 56th Division was ordered to concentrate in Zhangzhou. Subsequently, the central government sent Zhang Qun to Fujian to investigate the case. At the same time, the 56th Division also concentrated in Quanzhou. After Zhang arrived in the province, there were no results for a long time. Yang Shuzhuang ordered Liu Heding to lead the entire division into the province. Liu Shangzhi's 167th Brigade had previously advanced to Hui'an, and then advanced towards Putian. On the 28th of last month, they arrived outside the south gate of Putian. Gui Zhenyuan's 168th Brigade departed from Quanzhou to Hui'an on the 1st of this month, connecting with the 169th Brigade of Chen Wantai, which was stationed in Quanzhou, and decided to continue the departure immediately. While Liu's division was advancing north, Lu Xingbang had agreed to release the five provincial committee members and discussed a solution. The five committee members were sent to Beijing for central government disposal. The provincial government telegraphed Liu Heding, ordering his troops to stop advancing at their original locations. After Liu received the telegram, he immediately telegraphed the front to comply. Currently, Liu Shangzhi's brigade is temporarily stationed in Putian, and one regiment was sent to garrison the county seat on the 2nd. Gui Zhenyuan's brigade is stationed in Hui'an, and Chen Wantai's brigade is stationed between Quanzhou, Anhai, and Nan'an. However, they are all still preparing for military operations. According to Quanzhou news, if Lu Xingbang does not release the five provincial committee members, Liu's division will still advance. (March 7th)</p>
<h3>The Shigou Coal Mine in Suiyuan</h3>
<p>Enough to Mine for 143 Years</p>
<p>Annual Coal Production is 540,000 Tons</p>
<p>Profits of 2,160,000 Yuan Can Be Obtained</p>
<p>Saibei Correspondence: In the branch of the Daqingshan Mountains in Suiyuan, there is Shigou, where a rich coalfield has been discovered. Although the Monan and Jichang companies have tried to mine it, it is only a drop in the bucket and has not yet been explored in secret. Recently, the mineralogist Wang Yongshou conducted a survey, and the richness of the coal, the abundance of output, and the thickness of the profits are truly amazing, and they are unheard of by domestic capitalists and miners. Now, a brief record is made below to see the actual situation of the mine.</p>
<p>(1) Topography and Location Shigou belongs to Guyang County in the Sui area, more than sixty li away from Baotou, located slightly northeast, and more than eight hundred chi higher than Baotou. Although the mountains along the way undulate, fortunately the slope is not very large, and it is not very difficult to lay railways. More than ten li north of Shigou, the mountains stretch, with Zhengou Zhaogou, running north and south between them, so the hillside is not very steep, and future mining construction is quite easy.</p>
<p>(2) Geology and Coal Seams The Daqingshan area is mostly Jurassic rock, directly covering the Archean gneiss. The Shigou coal seam is here, interspersed with sandstone layers in the Jurassic coal-bearing sandstone. Although there are many coal seams there, there are three layers that have mining value. The stone layers between each layer range from dozens of feet to more than two hundred feet. The thickness of the first coal seam is from three feet to five feet, the second layer is about seven or eight feet thick, and the third layer is four or five feet thick. According to the old kiln workers in the area, the third layer has been found to have a coal seam more than ten feet thick, but the water volume in the old kiln is too large, and it is impossible to do anything with traditional mining methods, so work was stopped. The Jurassic sandstone of Daqingshan is very solid, and the coal seam is sandwiched in this sandstone, so the top and bottom plates are very stable, and there is no need for kiln wood to support it. Not only is the construction easy, but the cost of coal production will also be low in the future. North of Shigou, between Zhengou and Zhaogou in the north and south, and east of Zhaogou, a total of six or seven li, is the mining area of Monan Company and Jichang Company, with an area of about sixty square li. The strata form a basin, tilted on all sides, with a maximum of no more than thirty degrees, which is very neat and has few faults and disturbances. The three most valuable layers of good coal in Shigou all have outcrops on the nearby hillsides. In the small kilns mined by local methods, it is especially clear and verifiable. In the future, the Daqingshan area coalfield will be able to have railways, use machines, and carry out large-scale mining. This place should be the best.</p>
<p>(3) Coal Quality and Coal Volume The products near Shigou are all top-grade long-flame bituminous coal. According to analysts, this coal contains about 30.010 volatile components, about 55.01 fixed carbon, about 1.3910 hydrogen, and about 1.3510 carbon. It is very suitable for trains, ships, and factory household use, and it has great viscosity. It is used by people to refine coke, and the results are very good. The second layer of coal has less viscosity and is not very suitable for coking. Of these three layers of coal, except for the first and second layers, which are located quite high, and some have been eroded, and people have slightly mined them, the third layer has not been affected in any way, and the storage is especially rich. According to the minimum limit, there are three layers of coal with an average thickness of ten feet. Assuming that the coal seam is flat, sixty square li should have 3,857,625 tons of coal. Assuming that 1,500 tons of coal are produced every day, a total of 540,000 tons are produced every year. Based on this, the Shigou coalfield is enough to mine for 143 years, even if it is calculated at half, it is enough to mine for more than 70 years.</p>
<p>The results of this survey can be compared slightly, and the Shigou coalfield should be the most valuable and have the hope of immediate mining. The top and bottom plates of the coal seam are solid, and there is no need to use kiln wood to support the kiln. It is dry and there is no need to spend time pumping water, so coal mining is easy, and the cost is very light. The cost per ton is about 1.5 yuan to 2.23 yuan, depending on the depth of the kiln and the difficulty of coal production. The price of selling coal at the kiln is about 3 yuan per ton. Because transportation is inconvenient, transportation relies entirely on large vehicles and animal carrying. It takes three days to go back and forth from Shigou to Baotou, and coal can only be transported once, so the freight is 5 or 6 yuan per ton. Therefore, the price of Shigou coal in Baotou must be 10 yuan per ton. If it is transported to Suiyuan by train, then the price must be 18 or 9 yuan per ton. The reason why Daqingshan coal cannot compete with Datong coal is nothing else, but the transportation problem. Therefore, to develop the Shigou coal mining business, it is necessary to build a railway from Baotou to Shigou as soon as possible. If the transportation problem cannot be solved, there is no hope for the development of the Shigou mining industry. It is only more than sixty li from Shigou to Baotou. Railway transportation is at most 2 yuan per ton. If the cost of coal mining is calculated at 2 yuan per ton, plus 2 yuan for railway transportation, the selling price in Baotou is 8 yuan per ton, then the net profit per ton can be 4 yuan. If 1,500 tons are produced every day, then the net profit of 6,000 yuan can be obtained every day, and the net profit of 2,160,000 yuan can be obtained every year.</p>
<h3>The Commissioners of the Reorganization Committee of Various Counties in Jiangsu Took the Oath of Office</h3>
<p>At 2 PM on March 10th, the Party Affairs Reorganization Commissioners of more than 30 counties in Jiangsu Province, including Wuxi, held a swearing-in ceremony in the auditorium of the Provincial Party Headquarters. More than 80 reorganization commissioners from various counties attended. After performing the ceremony, the oath-takers first read the oath together. After the oath, they signed and sealed separate papers and submitted them to the Provincial Party Headquarters. Then, the supervising commissioner, Commissioner Qi Xiyong, gave a training speech, saying that this time, the commission appointed everyone, the method was very strict, and the time was very long. I believe that the results are still satisfactory. Everyone is a comrade who can take responsibility. After returning to the place of work, the first thing to do is to obey the orders of the superior party department. If there are orders to handle, they must be submitted on time. If all counties can do this, then the entire event in the province will have a solution. The second hope is that everyone can unite. Unity is the spirit that the committee system should have, and it is also the life of the committee system, because strength can only be generated by unity, otherwise it is easy to cause disputes and disperse the strength of the party department. There have often been phenomena of disunity in the past, and this should be corrected in the future. The third hope is that everyone will treat each other with true and sincere affection and be open and honest in handling all affairs, which can promote work and avoid disputes. The fourth hope is to correct the previous mistakes and work hard while being responsible for the work, as stated in the oath, to make a determination and never violate it. Otherwise, in addition to being sanctioned by the party, you will also be condemned by your conscience. The fifth hope is that everyone will break the concept of rights, eliminate prejudices, and take service as the purpose of all things, not acquisition. Everything should be selfless and strict with yourself. Do not only see other people's mistakes and not see your own mistakes. When you assign tasks, you should pay special attention to the principle that everyone can be qualified and not mix any selfish opinions. The sixth aspect of employing people should be decided by the plenary meeting. Do not have major opinions on trivial matters and affect the work of the whole. As long as you are open and honest, there will be no problems. In short, the reorganization of party affairs in various counties this time is not just about changing people, but must resolutely eradicate obstacles, regardless of factions, and earnestly do the work to serve the people, so as not to fall into the previous state of suicide, etc. Then, Commissioner Zhang Daofan, Commissioner Zhu Jianbai, and Commissioner Ye Xiufeng gave speeches one after another. Finally, Zhou Fengjing gave a reply on behalf of the oath-takers. (The words are omitted) The photos were taken and dispersed at 5 PM.</p>
<h3>Local Correspondence Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Anniversary of the Passing of the Prime Minister and the Tree Planting Ceremony The 5th Anniversary of the Passing of the Prime Minister was held at 12 AM on the 12th in the auditorium of the Mass Education Center. County Magistrate Jin, Chen Hanmin, the representative of the stationed army, Yao Qi, the party reorganization commissioner, and Zhu Shouru, the representative of the Education Bureau, gave speeches one after another. At 2 PM, the tree planting ceremony was held in the Zhongshan Forest of Yuhuangge. After all the representatives gathered, they took turns holding hoes to plant trees and took pictures to dismiss the meeting.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Charity Association Recommends Replacements Liu Zengxiang, a director of the Shanghai County Charity Board of Directors of the former Songjiang District, was vacant due to illness. Now, the Shanghai County Magistrate Leng has sent a letter to the Property Office to recommend a replacement. After Dong E was gone, it is now learned that Zhuang Shijie has been recommended to replace him. He sent a letter back to the county for verification. County Magistrate Jin drafted the appointment letter in accordance with the regulations and sent it to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>嘉定</h3>
<p>The Business and Education Association petitioned the government to exonerate Lu Linxun, the principal of the private school, and Shen Zhongxuan, the director of Lianxi Elementary School, who had been falsely accused and detained by the county. After being bailed out by the public, various groups such as the county chamber of commerce and the county education association, regarding Zhuge Zhongwen, who secretly reported to the province,</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>not only could they not find such a person in the county and there was no one with the surname Zhuge, but also the so-called reactionary evidence of the photoed certificate of appointment, with nine people combined on one sheet of paper, was extremely unlike the facts. It was obvious that it came from the opposition's fabrication. The government did not investigate deeply but relied on a mere blank document to arrest people everywhere, which not only encouraged the audacity of villains but also endangered everyone. Therefore, they jointly presented a petition to County Magistrate Chen, requesting him to take full responsibility and plead with the Civil Affairs Department on their behalf. If the plea was unsuccessful, he should use his resignation as a means of strong protest to apologize to the locality, and so on.</p>
<p>After reading the petition, County Magistrate Chen immediately applied for a twelve-day leave from the Civil Affairs Department and entered the province at noon. Ji Hanyun and other seven people who had not been arrested were also ordered to cease being pursued.</p>
<p>Two batches of refugees entered the county on the same day in Anting Town of the county. At around 8 a.m. on the 11th, suddenly eight Wu Shan boats arrived, fully loaded with refugees, coming from Qingpu, numbering about five or six hundred people, mostly burly men. After being suppressed by the town's defense corps, they were given six thousand cash and immediately left the border westward. Around 10 o'clock, another batch arrived, numbering about two hundred people carrying loads on their shoulders, with both women and children, appearing very miserable. They were also suppressed and given money by the defense corps and went to northeastern villages such as Wujiazhai and Xiejia Ku, extorting from village to village, catching chickens and beating dogs, causing quite a disturbance, and so on.</p>
<h3>Two weddings attended, relatives kidnapped</h3>
<p>In Anting Township, Xu Yubo, the former village chief of the Sixth Village, originally from Changshu, set the 7th of this month as the wedding date for his cousin Xu Erguan, who lived in Huangdu Township. On the 11th, it was also the date of his son's wedding. Several days ago, the two men agreed to send Erguan's son (the one getting married) back to Changshu to invite relatives to the feast and to buy green fish at a certain place in Dianshan Lake for preparation. However, when the auspicious day of the 7th arrived, not only were the relatives nowhere to be seen, but the groom who was inviting guests also disappeared. They had no choice but to suspend the wedding and inquire about the news from their relatives in their hometown. Everyone said that they had boarded a boat on the afternoon of the 3rd, with a total of six families, twenty-eight people, including old and young, men and women. When the two Xus heard the news, they helped in the search, but there were no clues. It was not until yesterday (the 11th), the date of Yubo's son's wedding, that another relative came to Anting to congratulate them. According to him, he had obtained accurate information that the boat had encountered lake bandits on the evening of the 4th, about two miles from the mouth of the Yangcheng River. The entire boat was kidnapped, and there were also more than one hundred and twenty yuan in congratulatory gifts, as well as personal gold jewelry and clothes, and purchased goods, resulting in losses of no less than a thousand yuan. Now they have received a letter from the bandits demanding a ransom of two hundred yuan per person, and they are currently sending people to negotiate.</p>
<h3>Anting Township arrests smokers and gamblers</h3>

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<h3>Examination of the Case of Liu Cai's Unexplained Death</h3>
<p>Liu Tonghuai, residing at No. 60, Shanxiang Lane in the city, on the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), through matchmaker Wang Fengshu, betrothed Cai Lianbao (currently 17 years old), the eldest daughter of Cai Yi, of Baoben Street, to his second son, Baosen. Later, because Cai Yi's matricide case occurred the year before, Liu had proposed terminating the engagement to Cai, but it was unsuccessful. In August of last year, Lianbao was brought into the family as a child bride. However, she did not get along well with Tonghuai and his wife and his younger sister. Her fiancé, Baosen, recently fell in love with Dai Xiangyuan, a prostitute in Gongyi Lane. According to Baosen's claim, he would hold a simultaneous wedding with Cai Lianbao and Dai Xiangyuan next month. The month before last, Baosen stole Lianbao's platinum watch and gave it to Xiangyuan, leading to a quarrel between them. As a result, Lianbao developed suicidal thoughts. On the morning of the 9th of this month, Cai Yi's concubine, Ms. Li, suddenly received an obituary from the Liu family, stating that Lianbao had already died of illness. Ms. Li immediately went to the Liu family and inquired about her illness, but Liu was evasive and vague. Because Lianbao's death was unexplained, Ms. Li filed a complaint with the county government. At 2:00 PM on the 10th, she went to examine the body. According to the coroner Cao, the back, arms, ears, and neck of the body showed signs of blood clots, but there was no cause of death. However, it was necessary to perform an autopsy and chemical examination to determine whether she had been poisoned. Investigating magistrate Chen and doctors Gu and Xie saw nothing different, but Ms. Li and Liu Tonghuai were willing to sign a guarantee to have Lianbao's body dissected and chemically examined. At 4:00 PM, the Cai family received a telegram from Cai Yi, demanding a detailed examination. The county government, based on Ms. Li's request, immediately ordered bailiffs to go to the Liu family to guard Cai Lianbao's body and await autopsy and chemical examination. At 1:00 PM on the following day, magistrate Chen, accompanied by Western doctors Zhou Mansheng and Gu Jianshan, and more than ten others, went to the Liu family to carry out Lianbao's body. Western doctor Zhou Mansheng performed the dissection. The results of the dissection showed that the chemical examination reaction was incorrect. After consulting with the Western doctors, they decided to cut off the internal organs, pack them into seven bottles, and ask the county government to send a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council's health department or a Western medical institution for chemical examination. Investigator Chen approved and took the internal organs back to the county government for letter preparation and shipment to Shanghai. He ordered the bereaved family, Ms. Li and Liu Tonghuai, to coffin Lianbao's body and re-examine it.</p>

<p>Due to heavy rain, there is a lot of standing water at the China Tennis Venue. It is practically impossible to hold the tennis competition. The Tennis Committee decided yesterday to postpone it until the venue is usable. The competition date will be announced soon.</p>
<p>(X) Changes to the Women's Volleyball Schedule</p>
<p>▲ Begins on the 15th</p>
<p>The women's volleyball competition originally consisted of a round-robin tournament between the Liangjiang, Flying Stars, and Minli teams. Subsequently, the Volleyball Committee received Order No. 1286 from the Municipal Bureau of Education, stating that the volleyball team of the Municipal Wuben Middle School has a good record and should be included in this citywide athletic meet.</p>
<p>Apart from informing them to register, they should also be included in the schedule. Therefore, in accordance with the order, the Wuben team is added to the competition, and the knockout system will be used. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Liangjiang vs. Wuben, 9 AM on the 15th, Referee: Li Feiyun</p>
<p>Flying Stars vs. Minli, 3:30 PM on the 15th, 1:30 PM on the 16th, Referee: Cai Tiange</p>
<p>(XI) Football Rescheduled to Begin on the 16th</p>
<p>The football preliminary rounds were originally scheduled for the 16th because there would be more spectators on that day. However, it was feared that there would be conflicts with the Chinese and Western football matches on the same day in terms of players and venue. Therefore, it was scheduled for the 13th and 14th. Now that the pitch is wet and there are no Chinese and Western football matches this week, it is approved to follow the original plan and reschedule the preliminary rounds to the 16th and 17th in the afternoon. The schedule is listed below:</p>
<p>Youyou vs. Huale 3 PM on the 16th</p>
<p>Jiaotong vs. Jinan 3 PM on the 17th</p>
<p>Final 4 PM on the 18th</p>

<h3>Japan's Predictions for the Far Eastern Basketball Championship</h3>
<p>▲ Intense Battle Expected Between Philippines and Japan for the Championship</p>
<p>▲ Japan's Swimmers Already in Training</p>
<p>(1) Japan's Hopes for Basketball</p>
<p>Mr. Yakushiji, Honorary General Secretary of the 9th Far Eastern Games and veteran of the Japanese basketball scene, stated that Mr. Motegi Teizo, the basketball coach for this Games, is his protégé. The reporter visited him on the 6th to inquire about his observations on the basketball championship. He said that the Philippines had won the basketball championship in all seven previous Games. In his opinion, the Philippines will still win this time. Firstly, the Philippines has an advantage due to historical reasons. Secondly, the Philippines' preparations are far more comprehensive than those of China and Japan. The Philippines selected its representatives and started training last autumn. Furthermore, considering the significant impact of climate and pressure on athletes' performance (sports scholars generally believe that the failure of American athletes at the World Games two years ago was due to differences in air pressure, and this theory has a scientific basis), they specially built a basketball court on a mountaintop to replicate the intensity of sunlight, climate, and air pressure in Tokyo in May. This will allow players to avoid feeling uncomfortable even when they are in a foreign land. The meticulousness of their plan shows that they are determined to win. Analyzing the strength of a basketball team should focus on three points: (1) the physique of the players; (2) the individual skills of the players; (3) the teamwork of the entire team. Japan has failed in the past due to lacking the latter two points. They have become aware of this and are working to remedy it. This year, these two points will be the criteria for selecting candidates for the Far Eastern Games. Due to the effects of Japan's vigorous promotion of sports in recent years, the physique of the average young person has improved, and their physical strength has increased. The difficulty of the first point has been overcome. As for teamwork, the observation of daily competitions between schools shows that the results are very good. Furthermore, the combined training camp for one or two months will hopefully perfect it. However, individual skills are still slightly weaker. This is due to the Japanese habit of emphasizing teamwork and starting practice as a team unit, which has led to adverse consequences. They are now working hard on this point during the combined training camp and expect to achieve considerable results. Regarding China's past performance, individual skills have been a strength in all three points. The standard for selecting team members is often individual skills, and those with quick individual movements often have short and small bodies. Furthermore, the team has not yet been selected, and they will inevitably be scrambling at the last minute. Therefore, teamwork will be difficult to develop. In his opinion, the championship will undoubtedly belong to the Philippines. As for the competition between China and Japan, it will be extremely fierce, and the winner is uncertain.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Yakushiji's criticism of the strength of the three countries is not without theoretical basis, but he is perhaps too confident in the Japanese team. From a personal perspective, Japan's basketball skills have indeed improved greatly in recent years, but their fatal flaws of stiffness and slowness are deeply rooted and cannot be corrected in a short period of time. There is little hope for them to achieve great things in this Games.</p>
<p>(2) Swimmers Actively Training</p>
<p>Regarding the preliminary selection of swimming athletes for the Far Eastern Games, it has been previously reported in this newspaper. The Kanto Swimming Association of Japan and the National Student Aquatic Sports Federation, considering that the date of the Games is approaching and that the weather is currently cold, making it inconvenient to train in outdoor swimming pools, have negotiated with the authorities of Meiji University to borrow the university's newly completed 25-meter indoor heated swimming pool for training. Training will be held twice a week and is limited to representatives designated last autumn and those hoping to attend the preliminary selection meeting for the Far Eastern Games this spring. Five veteran swimmers, including Matsumoto Ikkaku, have been assigned as training instructors.</p>

In the second half, the USA team scored another 37 points, while the Jewish team scored a total of 10 points. As a result, the USA team won with a score of 74-12. Referee Xu Zhendong.</p>

<p>▲ Results Diminished Due to Rain</p>
<p>The rain did not stop in the morning and afternoon of the 11th, and the track was very slippery. There was a risk of falling if one was not careful. For example, in the 400m race between Chen Ling and Pan Hongsheng, Pan was originally in front of Chen, but Pan slipped and almost fell midway, so Chen took the opportunity to move forward and lost first place. The other events, such as the 800m final, were held in heavy rain, resulting in poor results. The athletes blamed the weather for not cooperating, which caused the results to be diminished. It was a pity.</p>
<p>▲ Carefully Select Athletes</p>
<p>The purpose of this athletic meet is mainly to select athletes to participate in the National Games, so the winners of each event are not calculated by points, and there are no trophies to be won. Whether the top one, two, or three are all included in the delegation will be determined separately after careful review by the Selection Committee.</p>
<p>▲ Meeting Continues This Morning</p>
<p>The meeting ended at 3:30 PM the day before yesterday. The competition was suspended yesterday to commemorate the 5th anniversary of the Premier's death. The meeting will continue at the Public Sports Field from 9 AM today.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders All Primary and Secondary School Teachers to Use Mandarin</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, in order to promote Mandarin, yesterday issued an order to the education bureaus of all provinces, instructing all primary and secondary schools under their jurisdiction to use Mandarin for teaching. The Ministry has previously issued "repeated orders" to promote Mandarin in order to unify the language, prohibiting the use of classical Chinese textbooks in primary schools, not testing classical Chinese in junior high school entrance exams, and using vernacular Chinese in junior high school textbooks and teacher training schools, emphasizing standard Mandarin. However, previous orders focused on written language and did not mention the language used by teachers in teaching. If Mandarin is used in both vernacular Chinese and as the language of instruction, making students' reading and listening consistent, it will definitely be "twice the result with half the effort." Therefore, the ministry orders each department to instruct the primary and secondary school teachers under their jurisdiction to use a language "close to standard Mandarin" for teaching within a possible range. If some teachers cannot speak a language close to standard Mandarin, they should practice specifically. Educational administrative bodies should also provide them with methods or open night classes, weekday classes, or holiday classes to give them the opportunity to practice this language for application. There are two points to clarify. Firstly, young children have a strong ability to listen. They will be able to understand within two or three months of being taught in Mandarin. Do not think that they cannot understand easily and then outwardly comply but continue to use local dialects to teach. Secondly, apart from standard Mandarin, the so-called Mandarin will inevitably have different accents and is not completely pure. Although it is not very satisfactory to use impure Mandarin for teaching, it is still much better than using local dialects for teaching. Teachers should not be excused from not speaking because the Mandarin they speak is not pure. You must know that the more you speak Mandarin, the better it will become. If you are excused from not speaking at the beginning, how will you be able to speak well in the future? The above meanings are requested that each department be informed and that they be earnestly conveyed to all primary and secondary school teachers under their jurisdiction to be informed of this order.</p>
<h3>Actual Revenue of Land Tax in Various Counties of Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Province has levied land taxes in various counties to popularize education, with higher rates ranging from one dime to several cents per mu (unit of land area), and lower rates varying from four, six, to eight cents. Due to differences in the abundance of harvests across the counties each year, the levied amounts and the actual revenue collected have varied. Previously, the Jiangsu Provincial Joint Preparatory Office for Compulsory Education investigated the actual revenue of the newly added compulsory education land tax in various counties for the seventeenth year of the Republic. The actual figures from sixty-one counties have now been compiled and statistically analyzed. The recorded figures are excerpted below:</p>

He reportedly arrived at the Ministry on the 11th to officially begin his duties.</p>

<p>▲ Assembly Staff Chairman: Chen Dezheng; Recorders: Xu Xingchu, Huang Xianggu; Master of Ceremonies: Xu Yefu.</p>
<p>▲ Chairman's Report Today is the fifth anniversary of the death of Mr. Sun, our Party's Premier. It has been five years since the Premier left us. The Premier's life can be summarized in the four words "engaged in revolution." The work he led us to do in this world was entirely revolutionary work. The ideas he possessed throughout his life were entirely revolutionary ideas. The personality he embodied throughout his life was entirely a revolutionary personality. The Premier himself said that he devoted himself to the national revolution for a total of forty years. These forty years were like a single day, with a central goal. This central goal was to demand freedom and equality for China. Because China had lost its freedom and equality, the Premier struggled constantly during his lifetime. Although he experienced many failures, his determination to revolutionize only grew stronger with each failure. We recall that the reason the corrupt government of the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, the large and small warlords representing feudal forces were gradually eliminated, and the imperialists' ambitions to annex China were gradually eradicated. We also recall that the reason why the people are slowly being rescued from their most painful plight is that many of these achievements were led by our Premier. But now our Premier is dead. We are like children who have lost their loving mother. We are like blind people who no longer have anyone to guide us. Therefore, from the day the Premier died until today, these five years have been filled with sorrow, grief, and weeping. We mourn that we have lost a savior, we mourn that we have lost a loving mother, and we weep that all the weak and small nations of the world have lost a great leader. Therefore, these five years, our emotions have been filled with sorrow, and our hearts have been filled with pain. What we can comfort ourselves with now is that we are still running on the path, which is entirely the path that the Premier left us and showed us to take. At the same time, because there are successors to the Premier, who are constantly leading us, the Premier created the Three Principles of the People amidst countless hardships and founded the Chinese Nationalist Party. We can now continue to work together because of the Three Principles of the People, which guide us. The only precious Chinese Nationalist Party that the Premier left behind is leading us. Therefore, on the day of the fifth anniversary of the Premier's death, recalling the Premier's painstaking efforts during his lifetime, recalling the difficult and arduous work of the Premier during his lifetime, recalling the Premier's fearless spirit in going north alone, recalling the tragic scene of the Premier's death in Beijing, we also recall the grand scene of the Premier's body being enshrined in Nanjing. All of this is in our minds, making our tears flow uncontrollably. In these past five years, on the one hand, we have grieved over the loss of our loving mother, the loss of our savior, and we have felt extremely sad. What we can comfort ourselves with is that the entire force of the Northern Warlords has been completely shattered, and the forces led by the Premier have transformed from this fragmented situation to a unified nation. However, China is still in an extremely dangerous situation. The happy scenes of the past five years are still numerous, but the difficulties and hardships experienced are countless. In terms of the bigger picture, for example, the Communist Party's disturbances, the resurgence of large and small feudal forces, and the successive rebellions, all of these things are now appearing before our eyes one by one. In the past, whenever calamities arrived, we thought of our Premier. If the Premier were alive, many strange and bizarre situations would never have occurred. Unfortunately, our Premier is no longer here. We see that in the Premier's lifetime, whenever warlords arose who violated the interests of the people, the Premier would inevitably stand up and lead the people to fight against the warlords, and seize civil rights from the warlords. Now, although the warlords have disappeared on the surface, feudal forces can still be found everywhere. When we think of this situation, we feel even more sad. We can only follow the lessons that the Premier left us, abide by the Premier's teachings, and under the leadership of the Chinese Nationalist Party led by the Premier, jointly attack all large and small feudal forces, so that all large and small feudal forces are completely eliminated. This is the first meaning of our commemoration of the Premier today. Secondly, we think that the imperialists have been attacking us for more than just a year or two. Now, the imperialists want to make their final struggle and attack us. In the past, what we have seen is that the Japanese Jinan Massacre, the British massacre in Shanghai and Guangzhou, the Russian massacre on the Middle East Road, everywhere shows that the imperialists are continuing to attack us. The Premier led us to fight a deadly battle against the imperialists, and directed us to fight a continuous struggle against the imperialists. Now we have lost our mentor, our loving mother, and our savior. Although the Premier is dead, the teachings against imperialism are still there. If we are to demand freedom and equality for China, we can only follow the Premier's teachings, abide by the lessons the Premier gave us, and under the leadership of the Chinese Nationalist Party left by the Premier, continue to attack the imperialists, so that our China can achieve freedom and equality. This is the second meaning of our commemoration of the Premier's death. Thirdly, we know that the Premier once taught us that China is an economically underdeveloped country, with only the distinction between the very poor and the slightly poor, so we should try our best to create wealth and develop labor and capital equally. The Premier created the Principle of People's Livelihood to guide us. When we recall the many teachings that the Premier gave us at the time, we feel very sad about the current dangerous situation of the collapse of China's social organization. However, what can be comforting is that the Premier still left us with a method, instructing us to equalize land ownership and control capital, teaching us how to create wealth, how to build the country, and how to develop industry. We feel that if we want to solve China's livelihood problems and prevent China's economic organization from collapsing, we can only continue the Premier's will, follow the Premier's teachings, and under the leadership of the Chinese Nationalist Party led by the Premier, unite and jointly develop China's productive enterprises, which can save the current economic difficulties. This is the third meaning of today's commemoration of the Premier's death. In this very sad moment, recalling the situation of the Premier leading us during his lifetime, and the various tastes of sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness that we have tasted in the five years since the Premier's death, we can now conclude that our Premier is not dead. Although the Premier's body has left us, his spirit is forever instructing us, his teachings are forever teaching us, and the Chinese Nationalist Party he left behind is forever leading us. We can only fight according to the Premier's teachings and follow his Three Principles of the People. This is the Premier's intention during his lifetime, and it is also the meaning of our commemoration of the Premier today. Today is a very grand memorial meeting. If you have the opportunity to commemorate the Premier, please remember a few very serious words, which are that we must continue the Premier's will, abide by the Premier's teachings, and under the Chinese Nationalist Party left by the Premier, jointly fight.</p>
<p>▲ Summary of Speeches Pan Gongzhan's Speech: Just now, I heard the speaker's painful report. I think everyone present has a kind of unspeakable painful feeling. Recalling the Premier's death in Beiping, it has been five years now. In these five years, what kind of effects have we achieved? The first sentence of the Premier's will, seeking freedom and equality for China, has not yet been achieved. Although our country has achieved a considerable position in the international community through the five years of struggle by Party comrades and the revolutionary people, we should think again, has the international status really been equal? Have we obtained international freedom? Unequal treaties have not yet been eliminated. Now we must commemorate the Premier not by emphasizing formalities, but by continuing the Premier's will at all times. The three meanings of remembrance that the chairman told us just now are indeed correct, but to do these two things, there must be a kind of power. Only with power can it be expressed. Now, under the leadership of the Three Principles of the People of the Chinese Nationalist Party, we must concentrate our strength to fight together. But to discover our strength, it is necessary to have an organization. Now that we have an organization and a goal, we have not yet been able to fulfill this responsibility. Of course, we, the younger generation, cannot make excuses. Our painful feelings now are a sense of guilt in our conscience, and a sense of shame in ourselves. Now we have not been able to achieve satisfactory results with the Premier's teachings. We should reflect on our past work and ask ourselves why we have not achieved considerable success in these years. Perhaps it can be said that half of it is due to the relationship of the social environment, and the revolutionary cause is not something that can be achieved overnight. The Premier has been revolutionizing for forty years and still urged us to continue to work hard to complete the work of the revolution, and we are not as good as the Premier, so it is difficult to succeed. However, this is self-comfort. We should know our own mistakes. The Premier once warned us that the revolution must first revolutionize the heart. If the square inch of the heart is not washed well, how can we talk about the revolution and do the work of the revolution, to save the country and save mankind? We must restrain corrupt and evil thoughts and actions before we are worthy of doing revolutionary work. Commemorating the Premier, we must of course take all of the Premier's teachings as our motto after reflecting on ourselves. I specifically raise this point to encourage myself, and at the same time contribute it to you all. Second, we must sacrifice personal freedom. The Premier told us that China is too free, like a plate of loose sand. This is China's fatal wound. To remedy this defect, we must strengthen our organization and sacrifice our own personal freedom to abide by the regulations of the group. Now, a general reactionary scholar is actually advocating innate human rights. This is an outdated theory of the eighteenth century. We should eliminate it and not let it harm us and confuse people. In short, (1) We must be careful not to act romantically, (2) Reflect on our own mistakes, and at the same time, make a determination to sacrifice all of our freedom and work hard for the cause of the revolution. Then our commemoration of the Premier will not lose its meaning. Finished. Then Liu Zhanen and Zeng Yi spoke successively. The long speeches are not recorded.</p>
<p>▲ Assembly Slogans (1) Commemorate the Premier's great personality; (2) Continue the Premier's revolutionary spirit; (3) Sacrifice personal freedom and contribute one's ability; (4) Strengthen the Party's organization and abide by the Party's discipline; (5) Support the central government and consolidate the foundation of the Party; (6) Eliminate the remaining reactionary forces and work hard on political tutelage; (7) Promote national unity and implement local autonomy; (8) Vow to abide by the Premier's teachings and abolish unequal treaties; (9) Vigorously carry out afforestation and expand afforestation; (10) The Premier's spirit will never die; (11) Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party; (12) Long live the Republic of China.</p>
<p>▲ Assembly Eulogy On the twelfth day of March in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, leading all party members and all the citizens, respectfully offer incense and flowers to the spirit of our Premier. Alas, the Manchu Qing Dynasty was usurped, and China was in chaos. Powerful neighbors surrounded us, invading and plundering. The people's livelihood declined, and the foundation of the nation weakened. Heaven gave birth to the Father of the Nation to save this dark-haired people. His wanderings and exiles are recorded as miracles. To comfort the people and punish the guilty, he repeatedly raised the banner of righteousness. The righteous army was repeatedly defeated, but his will did not waver. The Wuchang Uprising re-established the foundation of the nation. When the Qing court was overthrown, the Han rituals were restored. The Republic was founded, and all the people rejoiced. The unorganized people held back, and political views were divergent. The peace agreement was mistaken as a warning, and the spies of the snake were employed. The second ministers of the Shu Han were spies, and their tools were instruments. Zhang Yi went to the Southern Capital, hoping to destroy the cave. The generals watched and waited, and again saw the miraculous achievements. He crossed the South China Sea and established the Canton. The commander-in-chief directed the troops. The northern Qing demons and the fierce generals were rampant. He turned the tide and followed the ship to discuss the thieves. The Pearl Sea was dusted, and the Yunnan army was pacified. The righteous qi was restored, and Cao and Wu divided the land. The northern rivers were submerged in the Central Plains. The north and south were fighting to support justice. After several autumns and springs, he traveled north to wait for the unfolding of his ambitions. The illness was severe, and a great star suddenly fell. Ten thousand people mourned, and the whole world grieved. The Biyun Temple and the Zhongshan Mausoleum are beautiful cities, and the lush land will forever protect the heroic spirit. Since the death of the public, the years have changed repeatedly. In these five years, the sea and the universe have been cleared. The righteous army marched north and completely conquered You and Bing. The evil was wiped out, and the rebels were pacified. The Three Principles of the People and the Five Powers Constitution prevailed. Political tutelage began, and construction was about to be completed. His voice and appearance are still there, and his teachings are flourishing. His immortal traces are distant, and the sea is blue and the sky is clear. We rely on his spiritual nature. Though dead, he is still alive. We offer a bundle of rushes and a glass of clear liquor. We present our words from afar, and our tears flow together. May his spirit come and enjoy this sincerity. Alas, may he enjoy it.</p>
<p>Afternoon Tree-Planting Ceremony Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 p.m., the Municipal Party Department led representatives from various district and branch party headquarters to hold a tree-planting ceremony at the Dali Hall of the No. 1 Civilian Housing Estate of the Municipal Government, about two miles east of the park shooting range on Quanjia'an Road.

Huang E then gave a speech, and the meeting was adjourned with the shouting of slogans. After the adjournment, Comrade Tang continued to lead the tree-planting around the Dali Hall of the civilian housing estate, and photographs were taken. Although the rain was heavy and the wind was strong, the spirit was even more vibrant.</p>
<h3>Commemoration Activities of Various Organizations</h3>
<p>▲Garrison Command and the Fifth Division:淞滬 Garrison</p>
<p>The entire officers of the 淞滬 Garrison Command and the Fifth Division held a memorial service for the fifth anniversary of the death of Sun Yat-sen in the auditorium of the Command Headquarters at 10 a.m. yesterday. Commander Xiong presided over the meeting and reported on the significance of the fifth anniversary and tree planting, stating briefly that there are two obstacles to the survival and evolution of the Chinese nation: (1) natural forces and (2) man-made forces. Natural forces include various disasters such as floods, droughts, and typhoons, which can only be remedied by planting trees. Man-made forces include imperialist aggression and the exploitation of feudal remnants, which can only be eliminated by adhering to Sun Yat-sen's teachings and striving for national revolution. Today, on the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death, we must remember these two points and put them into practice. Next, Chief of Staff Guo gave a speech. After the ceremony, the officers and soldiers gathered at Longhua Airport for a grand tree planting ceremony, which did not end until around 2 p.m.</p>
<h3>Naval Department and Disbandment Office</h3>
<p>The Naval Special Party Department, together with all staff members of the Naval Disbandment Office, and representatives from naval vessels and various agencies in Shanghai, held a memorial service in the department's auditorium at 10 a.m. yesterday. Commander Chen Xunyong of the training fleet presided over the meeting, and Committee Member Ren Guangzi of the Special Party Department reported on Sun Yat-sen's affairs. The order was as follows: (1) All stand at attention; (2) Sing the Party anthem; (3) Bow deeply to the national flag, Party flag, and Sun Yat-sen's portrait; (4) The chairman respectfully reads Sun Yat-sen's will; (5) Observe three minutes of silence; (6) Present flowers; (7) Read the memorial address; (8) Report on Sun Yat-sen's affairs; (9) Speeches; (10) Shout slogans; (11) Adjourn the meeting. Over two hundred people attended. The ceremony was very solemn. The report by Committee Member Ren is recorded briefly as follows: Today is the fifth anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death in Beiping. The Naval Special Party Department convened personnel from various naval agencies in Shanghai to hold a memorial ceremony. All of you have either seen Sun Yat-sen's life history and hardships in books and newspapers, or witnessed them in reality, or seen the central propaganda outline. Guangyu need not elaborate. However, it is important to share what I have heard and seen. Sun Yat-sen's life experience, how he struggled through hardships, and his unwavering spirit in the face of setbacks, as well as all his words and deeds for the people, the country, and the world, we should always keep in mind. In this commemoration, we should especially remember Guanzi's saying: "Those who hear the Tao and love their families are people of their families; those who hear the Tao and love their countries are people of their countries; those who hear the Tao and love the world are people of the world." Sun Yat-sen's early revolutionary thought was based on the belief that the Manchu autocracy was extremely corrupt and oppressed the Han people, causing suffering to the people of the whole country. Therefore, he first had the idea of racial revolution to seek the liberation of the Han people from Manchu autocracy and make China strong, which is to love the country. In his later years, his thought was to support the weak and small nations of the world and seek their liberation from the oppression of imperialists, so as to achieve world harmony, which is to love the world. When the revolution succeeds and the world achieves harmony, virtue will be admired by the majority of people in the world. Now that Sun Yat-sen has passed away, his aspirations have not yet been realized. Sun Yat-sen left a will and said that the revolution has not yet succeeded, and comrades still need to work hard. We, who have deeply imprinted Sun Yat-sen's life experience and all his words and deeds in our minds, should follow his will, take responsibility, and put it into practice to be true members of the Kuomintang, believers of Sun Yat-sen, and citizens of the Republic of China. Confucius said, "Yao and Shun were men; I am also a man. Whoever strives will be like them." The significance of our holding a memorial service for Sun Yat-sen's death, I believe everyone has a clear understanding.</p>
<p>▲The Shanghai Municipal Government held a memorial service for the fifth anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death at 9 a.m. yesterday. More than 300 staff members from the municipal government and various bureaus attended. The order of the meeting was as follows: (1) Opening of the meeting; (2) Singing the Party anthem; (3) Playing mourning music; (4) Bowing three times to Sun Yat-sen's portrait; (5) Respectfully reading the will; (6) Bowing heads in silence for three minutes; (7) Presenting wreaths; (8) Chairman's report; (9) Speeches; (10) Shouting slogans; (11) Adjournment.</p>
<p>▲Mayor Zhang's Report: Today is the fifth anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. Sun Yat-sen's great personality and glorious achievements are already known to everyone. There is universal praise, so it is unnecessary for us to add more words. Therefore, today's commemoration of Sun Yat-sen not only has a commemorative meaning, but also will promote and carry forward Sun Yat-sen's aspirations and desires. The atmosphere of the meeting place was filled with Sun Yat-sen's spirit of fearlessness. In the solemn sorrow, it expressed magnificent and heroic thoughts, and a solemn and grand spirit, as if Sun Yat-sen was present and still leading us forward step by step on the revolutionary road. Therefore, several people have two feelings about today's commemoration of Sun Yat-sen: (1) The value of commemoration: Since the founding of the Republic of China, several revolutionary anniversaries have been produced, such as the Wuchang Uprising, the North-South unification, etc., each with its own meaning and value. However, all commemorations are produced because of the revolution, while Sun Yat-sen is the founder of the revolution. There is revolution only with Sun Yat-sen, and there is commemoration only with revolution. In other words, all revolutionary anniversaries are produced by Sun Yat-sen. Therefore, the value of commemorating Sun Yat-sen far exceeds that of other revolutionary anniversaries. And the greatest commemorations of Sun Yat-sen's life are his birthday and death anniversary. Sun Yat-sen's birth gave the Chinese national revolution a dawn. Sun Yat-sen's death is a period of more than 40 years of revolutionary history. Sun Yat-sen, with his unfinished aspirations and unrealized desires, made a will and entrusted us to continue to struggle and complete the revolutionary cause. Therefore, his death anniversary is a day of carrying on the past and opening up the future, and its value is greater than that of the birth anniversary and greater than that of all other revolutionary anniversaries. (2) The meaning of commemoration: From the above description of the great value of commemoration, we can infer that its meaning is far-reaching and profound. Now, let's analyze it into three points: (A) The spirit of leadership: Sun Yat-sen was the first person to create the Chinese Republic revolution. All the revolutionary martyrs of the past, the revolutionary comrades of the present, and the revolutionary descendants of the future are all striving and continuing to move forward under Sun Yat-sen's leadership. Throughout his life, Sun Yat-sen traveled to various countries and expressed deep sympathy to the revolutionary patriots of various weak and small nations, and constantly aroused their revolutionary interest. Therefore, he not only led the revolutionaries of China, but also led the revolutionaries of the world. Sun Yat-sen went to Beiping twice in his life. The first time was in the first year of the Republic of China, when he went deep into the tiger's den with a spirit of fearlessness to observe Yuan Shikai's ambition to restore the imperial system and expose his conspiracy. The second time was in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, when the Qing Dynasty was completely abolished and Duan Qirui called himself the chief executive. Sun Yat-sen, regardless of the dangers, went to inspect and wanted to arouse the people of the North with peaceful struggle revolution. In the end, he died of overwork at an old age and died in Beiping, which greatly moved the people of the North and expressed their warm sympathy for the revolution. And the people of the whole country were even more shocked and inspired to comfort Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen's spirit of leadership is not only infused into the whole country, but also infused into the world. It is not only expressed in his lifetime, but also expressed after his death. Its breadth and depth are unprecedented in ancient and modern times. (B) The responsibility of inheritance: Sun Yat-sen, on his deathbed, entrusted the responsibility of the revolution not yet succeeding to us, the comrades and compatriots who died later. In Sun Yat-sen's will, such as seeking freedom and equality for China, awakening the people, and uniting with the nations of the world that treat us equally to fight together, and eliminating unequal treaties, etc., as well as Sun Yat-sen's works, such as the Outline of National Reconstruction, the Strategy of National Reconstruction, the Three Principles of the People, and the declaration of the First National Congress, are all instructions for us to take the revolutionary path and methods of construction. Let us think carefully about how much we have done for the responsibility that Sun Yat-sen has given us. Therefore, the responsibility in the future is very important. Today, when we commemorate Sun Yat-sen, we should strive together to shoulder this important responsibility and complete it as soon as possible, so as not to fail to live up to the good intentions of his will and entrustment on his deathbed. The commemoration of today is still meaningful and valuable, and it will be passed on for a long time and will never be forgotten. (C) Efforts in construction: Sun Yat-sen's so-called revolution has not yet succeeded, of course, refers to the whole. From military administration to political administration to government administration, all construction work should be carried out in an orderly manner, without being perfunctory, without evasion, without recklessness, and without rashness, and there will be a day of completion. Now the period of political tutelage has been fixed, and the six years will soon be over. The transition from political tutelage to constitutional government is not far away. However, the foundation of constitutional government must be consolidated during the period of political tutelage. The so-called spirit of governing the country with the Party is also in this and not in that. The construction work during the period of political tutelage is stipulated in the Outline of National Reconstruction. If we want to complete the hope of the revolution, we must shoulder all the construction work during the period of political tutelage together, follow Sun Yat-sen's will, and put it into practice, without giving up on ourselves and without slackening, then the six-year period can be expected to be only the current obstacles. In fact, it is an inevitable process that cannot be avoided. But with Sun Yat-sen's spirit of fearlessness as the mission of all construction work, we should encourage and inspire ourselves and move forward, so that Sun Yat-sen, though dead, is still alive, and his spirit is bright and clear above, and brightly in front, leading us on the bright and upright revolutionary road, never retreating a step, to complete Sun Yat-sen's entire revolutionary desire. The above three points are the great significance of commemorating Sun Yat-sen's death today. Only with this great commemorative significance can there be the above-mentioned great commemorative value. Time flies, and Sun Yat-sen's death has been five years ago. I sincerely hope that comrades and compatriots will not forget the meaning and value of commemoration on this solemn day of mourning, cheer up, take responsibility, and complete the common wish of the revolution, which is of the utmost importance. The end.</p>
<p>▲Director Pan's Speech: Today, in the fine rain, we are holding a memorial service for the fifth anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. Brothers, when I think of the weather today, it is just like the situation when Sun Yat-sen died in Beiping five years ago. We remember that Sun Yat-sen's last cry was to seek peace and struggle to save China. Since the Northern Expedition, until today, the whole country has been unified under the leadership of the National Government. It seems that the atmosphere of peace fills the whole country, but there are still a few warlords who are still doing destructive work there. If we want peace, we have to struggle with those who destroy peace in order to achieve the ultimate goal of saving China. Only in this way can we improve China's unequal status. Therefore, when we commemorate Sun Yat-sen, we should always pay attention to these three sentences. But among these three sentences, struggle is the most important, because the purpose of struggle is not to struggle for personal rights, but to struggle for the majority of the people. Therefore, we must take service as our purpose and do everything well. Although the things that everyone does have different sizes and positions, some serve one or two people, some serve hundreds of people, and some serve thousands or even the majority of people. But if we forget to struggle for the public and think about private rights, we will not get peace and we will not be able to save China. For example, when we work in Shanghai, we must understand that we are serving 2.7 million citizens and constantly struggling. Then we can get one day's achievement one day, and one year's achievement one year. If everyone does this, then peace can be expected and China can be saved. Sun Yat-sen's teachings are many, but we only need to remember these three words: peace, struggle, and save China, to continue Sun Yat-sen's will and complete the entire success of the revolution. Therefore, I especially bring it up today when we commemorate Sun Yat-sen, hoping that you will pay attention to it in a practical way.</p>

<h3>The Grand Occasion of Tree Planting in This City Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mayor Zhang Had a Very Sincere Speech</p>
<p>Yesterday, various agencies and schools in this city held tree planting ceremonies. The venue was set up in the open space opposite the municipal government. A decorated archway was erected at the entrance, and a lecture platform was set up inside. Representatives from various agencies and students from municipal schools, about 2,000 people, attended.

<p>▲Mayor's Speech: On this day of commemorating Sun Yat-sen's death, we are holding a tree planting ceremony to commemorate Sun Yat-sen's great personality, but it is only to express the implementation of Sun Yat-sen's forestry policy and to promote the automatic participation of the people of the whole country in tree planting. The Shanghai Special Municipality has held tree planting ceremonies three times, including this one. The first time was the year before last, held on Xiaomuqiao Road to the east of today's venue. The second time was last year, held in Pudong and Puxi. This year is the third time, held here. Many people attended, but apart from the comrades of the Party Department, the civil servants of various agencies, and the teachers and students of schools, it seems that the public's free participation is not very enthusiastic. This is something that we should pay attention to. Is it because our propaganda of the meaning of tree planting is not sufficient? Is our promotion strength not perfect? Or do the citizens of the city not yet understand that afforestation can regulate the climate, prevent floods and droughts, and benefit health? All of us who are attending today should treat this as a major issue and study it. In my opinion, the citizens of Shanghai should pay special attention to the promotion of tree planting. First, Shanghai is a city. Living in a city means living in a place where life is short. When we compare the countryside with the city, how fresh is the air in the countryside, and how vibrant is the land in the countryside. In big cities, in addition to enjoying some conveniences in terms of special construction, where can we find the natural life that is as comfortable as in the countryside? Therefore, all countries in the world, no matter which city, have proven from population statistics that the people in the city are shorter-lived than the people in the countryside. We Shanghainese have a common problem: we think that tree planting is something that rural people do. It seems that urban people disdain to do it. So we take tree planting very lightly. In fact, we live in this kind of short-lived place. If we don't use tree planting to absorb carbon dioxide and supply oxygen, and live in pigeon cage-like houses all day long, and walk on cement and asphalt roads, there will be many disadvantages in terms of hygiene. If we encounter changes in the weather and the spread of diseases, it can be said that the lives of citizens are in danger at all times. If we want to build a great Shanghai with the policy of urbanizing the countryside and remedy this shortcoming, we have to hope that citizens will come forward to promote tree planting. Second, our China is originally a country that is based on agriculture. Tree planting is of course also one of the agricultural affairs. But let us talk about forests and timber. Please think about whether all the timber used for construction in Shanghai now is produced in China. Of course, everyone knows that the timber used for construction in Shanghai now is foreign pine. Foreign pine is a foreign product. Why don't we use Chinese products? In fact, it is because Chinese timber is not enough for use. Why is there not enough Chinese timber? Because we Chinese don't pay much attention to tree planting, especially because we people living in cities did not promote domestic timber enough in the past. Speaking of this, I am reminded of something I learned when I went to Fujian this time. In northern Fujian, there is a custom that is very worthy of our attention. That is, when a family has a newborn son, relatives and friends will congratulate them. Their way of congratulating is to plant trees on the family's house or land. Their intention is probably to think that planting small trees and waiting for them to grow up day by day is a metaphor for the child growing up. Therefore, because of this custom, Fujian has become the most important area for timber production in China. In the past, Fujian exported timber worth 15 million yuan every year, most of which was sold to Shanghai. But now, because we Shanghainese love to use foreign pine and don't promote it, their sales have decreased, and the annual export is only worth 10 million yuan. If we Chinese immediately learn and understand, and all major cities use domestic products for construction, the forestry industry can naturally develop immediately. If Shanghainese take the lead in promoting it, the effect will of course be very great, and it will have significant benefits for the national economy and the national economy. Finally, there are still some heartbreaking feelings. That is, the past planting has bad phenomena. Although the results of our previous two tree planting campaigns were somewhat successful, there are still many bad elements who not only do not know the value of tree planting and participate in tree planting together and cherish trees, but instead damage and steal the trees planted on the roadside. This is showing our citizens' weaknesses. If foreigners see it and criticize it, how shameful it would be. We hope that after this campaign, this phenomenon will not be discovered again. When we go to foreign parks, we don't see signs prohibiting the picking of flowers and plants. In China, it is inconvenient to put such signs in the parks, but even in people's homes, we see such signs. It can be seen that we Chinese not only don't pay attention to promotion, but also don't know how to cherish. I hope that fellow compatriots and comrades will pay more attention to the promotion of afforestation and the improvement of this inferior nature of our compatriots in the future.</p>
<p>▲Those who received saplings were enthusiastic. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau previously ordered the garden nursery to prepare more than 16,000 saplings for various organizations to receive and plant. In advance, staff were assigned to clearly mark the types and quantities of saplings received by various places. From 9 a.m. yesterday, those who received the saplings filled out receipts at the inspection and distribution office and received them in turn. It is estimated that more than three-quarters of those who received the saplings throughout the day had left. ▲Slogans: (1) Tree planting is to commemorate Sun Yat-sen; (2) Tree planting is a necessary work for municipal construction; (3) Universal tree planting can prevent the outflow of profits; (4) To build a career, first plant trees; (5) To solve food, clothing, housing and transportation, first plant trees; (6) Tree planting is a long-term saving for oneself; (7) Strive for the tree planting movement.</p>
<h3>Resumption of Voyages by Chinese Steamships on Various Routes</h3>
<p>Chinese steamship companies, which had suspended operations since April of last year, have seen some intermittent resumptions, such as in June, August, and November. However, these were short-lived. For example, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Changjiang vessels "Jiang Tian," "Kuai Li," and the San Bei Company's "Fu Yang," among others, have been suspended for over ten months. Other vessels that stopped and started sporadically numbered sixteen or seventeen on the Yangtze River, and more than ten on the outer seas. At the peak of the suspension of Chinese steamships in Shanghai last year, there were over seventy vessels idle. The misfortunes of Chinese shipping merchants last year were unprecedented. Last month, some of the chartered Chinese vessels were allowed to return. Amidst the soaring water freight rates on the Yangtze River, some Chinese steamships could be made available for commercial transport, which is indeed good news for the business community. Details are listed below:</p>
<p>▲Resumption of River Steamer Operations: Earlier this month, Yu Qiaqing of the Chinese San Bei Company telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, requesting that several Yangtze River steamers be released for commercial use to prevent foreign merchants from taking advantage of the situation. He also telegraphed Qiu Wei, Director of the Hankou Shipping Administration, requesting the release of ships for passage. Chairman Chiang, acceding to the request of Shanghai shipping merchants, has released the China Merchants Bureau's "Jiang Xin," "Jiang Hua," "Jiang Jing," and "Jiang Shun" in advance. The San Bei Company's "Chang An" and "Fu Long" were also released at the same time. Therefore, starting this week, six Chinese commercial vessels can operate on the Yangtze River route in advance. The San Bei Company's "Xin Ning Xing," which had engine damage en route, has been repaired and will arrive in Shanghai soon. The Shipping Bureau is working to salvage the "Fei Chu" vessel, which was sunk by the "Jiang Zhen," and has also lodged a protest with the Naval Department.</p>
<p>▲North Sea Navigation: Since the White River thawed this year, Chinese steamships on the North Sea route have only operated once. Subsequently, due to the need for Yangtze River cargo space, the "Xin Nian" and others were reassigned to the Shanghai-Hankou route, leaving the Tianjin-Yantai shipping entirely in the hands of foreign vessels. The Japanese Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha has temporarily added North China special services to compete for cargo transportation rights. Starting this week, the China Merchants Bureau has resumed North Sea services with the "Xin Ming" and "Xin Feng" vessels, which departed for Tianjin in the past two days. The "Gong Ping" vessel is transporting over a thousand of Ma Fuxiang's guards to Anqing via Qingdao. After they disembark, it can return to Shanghai and resume operations to Niuzhuang and other ports. Yingkou has now thawed, and yesterday, various shipping companies in Shanghai received telegrams from that port requesting the dispatch of ships to transport accumulated cargo. The local Taikoo, Dalian, and other companies have agreed to resume the Niuzhuang line starting on the 15th.</p>
<p>▲Qingdao Cargo Congestion and Rising Gold Prices: During the two significant fluctuations in gold prices this month, Shanghai merchants were shipping large quantities of goods to Qingdao. Qingdao merchants telegraphed, stating that goods arriving in the port and stored in warehouses were suffering losses due to the rising gold prices. Merchants were unwilling to take delivery, causing warehouses to be filled to capacity, with no space for new arrivals. They requested Shanghai to temporarily suspend shipping goods to Qingdao. Except for small quantities of goods, large shipments to Qingdao have been terminated.</p>
<p>▲South Sea Cargo Congestion in Shanghai: Export goods shipped from Shanghai to Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangzhou in the South Seas are currently experiencing significant congestion, especially raw peanuts, peanut cakes, and seeds. Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nissin, and other companies are taking advantage of the absence of Chinese steamship services to propose a 15% increase in freight rates starting on the 17th of this month, citing rising gold prices and increased expenses as justification. Guangzhou merchants recently telegraphed the China Merchants Bureau, requesting the dispatch of ships to prevent foreign merchants from monopolizing South Sea shipping rights. The China Merchants Bureau has redeployed the "Guang Da" and "Tai Shun" vessels to operate on the South Sea route starting this week to meet the needs of merchants.</p>

<h3>Unreasonable Obstruction by the British Consul During Jury Trials</h3>
<p>—The Progress of Two Cases Tried by Judge Yang—</p>
<p>▲British Lawyer Disrespects the Court</p>
<p>▲Extremely Absurd Words and Actions</p>
<p>▲British Consul Unreasonably Protects and Shields</p>
<p>▲The Court is Considering Countermeasures</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the 10th of this month, Judge Yang Zhaolong of the Provisional Court heard Chinese-foreign execution cases in the Sixth Tribunal, with British Consul Herbert acting as a juror. Among the cases scheduled for that day were a case between the British-Chinese Commercial Bank and Huang Hongjun regarding debt, and a case between the British company Hamley &amp; Company and Wanliyuan regarding payment for goods.</p>
<p>▲Case of the Chinese Commercial Bank and Huang Hongjun: The judge first heard the first case. According to the judgment of the Sino-Foreign Appeals Office affiliated with the Jiangsu Bureau of Foreign Affairs, the defendant should repay the plaintiff a certain amount, and the plaintiff should also repay the defendant a certain amount. However, the plaintiff was in liquidation, and the amount owed to the defendant could not be fully repaid, while the amount owed to the plaintiff by the defendant should be paid in full. During previous hearings, the defendant's lawyer raised the issue of offsetting debts, requesting the plaintiff to make concessions. Both parties requested a temporary suspension of execution to allow for out-of-court settlement, which the judge approved, and the case was rescheduled to the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>▲Ordered to Repay Debt Within Two Weeks: When the court convened the other day, the defendant's lawyer did not appear. The plaintiff's representative, lawyer Godfrey, stated that the settlement had failed and requested the seizure of the defendant's business. The judge, noting that the defendant's lawyer was not in court, perhaps due to a misremembered date, and believing that the defendant himself was not at fault, did not consider it appropriate to seize the business at that time. He ruled that the defendant should repay the debt to the plaintiff within two weeks in accordance with the judgment. The plaintiff's lawyer expressed dissatisfaction with this ruling, stating, "The purpose of my lawyer's appearance in court today is to execute this case. The fact that your court is only ordering the defendant to pay within two weeks cannot be considered execution. I do not understand the purpose of your court's ruling." The judge replied, "Ordering the defendant to pay within two weeks is also part of the execution process."</p>
<p>▲Western Lawyer in the Audience Publicly Criticizes: At this point, British lawyer Brown (representing the British company Hamley &amp; Company in another case), who was in the audience, suddenly exclaimed, "Wrong!" The judge, believing that the lawyer, as a member of the audience, dared to publicly criticize the court's ruling, showing a lack of respect for the law and intending to insult, immediately asked him why he said that and asked him to leave the court. The lawyer initially did not answer, then said, "I was talking to myself and did not intend to offend the court." The judge, seeing his evasive response, did not argue further.</p>
<p>▲Unreasonable Reproach from the British Consul: Unexpectedly, the British Consul Herbert, who was serving as a juror, did not approve of the judge's actions and instead reproached him, saying, "Many people are talking in the courtroom. Why are you only interfering with this one lawyer?" The judge, seeing his biased and unreasonable attitude, chose to remain silent to avoid further complications.</p>
<p>▲Case of Hamley &amp; Company and Wanliyuan: Next, the case between the British company Hamley &amp; Company and Wanliyuan was heard. According to the case, the defendant had ordered goods from the plaintiff but had not taken delivery. The plaintiff sued the defendant for the price of the goods, approximately 4,000 taels of silver. After the court's judgment was finalized, the plaintiff requested execution. Xu, the judge handling the execution case, ordered the plaintiff to have the undelivered goods sold at auction within seven days at an estimated price, or to submit them to the court for designation of an auction house. However, the plaintiff consistently failed to comply with this order.</p>
<p>▲Reasons for Not Delivering the Goods to the Court: When Judge Yang took over the case, he immediately asked the plaintiff's lawyer, Brown, the reason for not complying with the order. He claimed that the plaintiff had a lien on the undelivered goods and had agreed with the defendant to use the goods to offset part of the debt. The remaining debt had also been paid by the defendant, so he now requested the dismissal of the case.</p>
<p>▲Unclear How Much the Goods Offset: The judge noted that the defendant Wanliyuan had been declared bankrupt, and the British company Hamley &amp; Company should be treated the same as other creditors. Their debt relationship with Wanliyuan should not be settled privately. He immediately inquired how much of the debt the undelivered goods offset and how the remaining debt was repaid by the defendant. The lawyer answered "I don't know" to all of these questions.</p>
<p>▲The Money Has Been Paid, No Right to Withhold Goods: Then, the defendant Wanliyuan's lawyer stated that the defendant had repaid the plaintiff the full amount of the goods in cash, and the plaintiff no longer had a lien on the undelivered goods and should be ordered to return them. He presented a receipt for over 4,000 taels issued by the plaintiff as evidence.</p>
<p>▲Denying Receipt of Money Requires Proof: The judge then asked the plaintiff's lawyer whether the receipt was proof that the plaintiff had received over 4,000 taels in cash from the defendant. The lawyer replied that the receipt was for another transaction and was unrelated to this case. The judge informed him that the amount on the receipt matched the amount stated in the judgment of this case, proving that it was related to this case. If the plaintiff denied this fact, he should provide proof. However, the lawyer not only disagreed with the judge's statement, but also stated, "If the defendant, its creditors, or the court are dissatisfied with the plaintiff's actions, they can sue the plaintiff in a British court."</p>
<p>▲The Court Has No Right to Summon British Citizens?: At this time, British Consul Herbert, who was serving as a juror, expressed opposition to the judge's statement. The judge, seeing that arguing was pointless, ruled that the plaintiff should comply with the previous ruling and submit the defendant's undelivered goods to the court for further action. Unexpectedly, the British Consul also expressed opposition to this ruling, arguing that the Provisional Court had no right to issue orders to British citizens. Subsequently, the case was scheduled for another hearing. British Consul Herbert refused to sign the summons to the plaintiff, citing that the Chinese court had no right to issue summons to British citizens.</p>
<p>▲Lawyer Falsely Claims Revocation of Mandate: The plaintiff's lawyer, after receiving the hearing notice, sent a letter falsely claiming that the plaintiff had revoked his mandate and he could no longer appear in court on their behalf, to show resistance. The 10th of this month was the date for hearing another case in which the British company Hamley &amp; Company was the plaintiff. The judge anticipated that the plaintiff would definitely have to appear in court that day due to that case, so he scheduled the Wanliyuan case for the same day in advance.</p>
<p>▲Appearing in Court to Show Goodwill to the Court: Lawyer Brown appeared in court as usual on behalf of the plaintiff. The judge, noting that the lawyer had stated that his mandate had been revoked, asked him in what capacity he was appearing. The lawyer's conflicting statements could not be reconciled. After thinking for a long time, he finally replied, "I am here today only to show goodwill to the court."</p>
<p>▲The Plaintiff's Accountant's Account of Events: The judge, finding his answer strange, immediately questioned the plaintiff's chief accountant about how the defendant had repaid the judgment amount to the plaintiff. According to the accountant, the defendant had repaid the full amount of over 4,000 taels in bank drafts in September of last year. The bank drafts had already been cashed, and the receipt presented by the defendant was the receipt issued by the plaintiff after receiving the money. The undelivered goods had also been returned.</p>
<p>▲Lawyer Suspected of Deceiving the Court: The judge found it very strange that his testimony was completely contrary to what lawyer Brown had stated during previous hearings since September of last year. Just as he was about to question the lawyer, the lawyer, realizing that his false statements were impossible to conceal, suddenly stood up and said, "My lawyer has already stated this to your court at the previous hearing." The judge replied, "As far as this court knows, your lawyer's previous statements were completely different. The records of this case are proof. Your lawyer is either intentionally deceiving the court, or his mind is so unclear that it is impossible to tell."</p>
<p>▲British Consul Launched a Public Attack in Court: At this time, British Consul Herbert launched a major attack on the judge's remarks and strongly defended the lawyer. Because the judge did not argue with him, he instructed the lawyer to file a protest. After hearing this, the lawyer left the seat, and the British Consul and the plaintiff then left the court one after another, while the judge continued to hear other cases. It is said that the court is currently considering countermeasures to this matter.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Hurricane in Wusong</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, it rained heavily in Wusong. After 11:00 AM, the rain gradually stopped, but the sky was filled with haze. Experienced sailors already knew that a strong wind was coming and hurried to moor in the harbor to avoid accidents. At about 1:30 PM, a hurricane suddenly arose outside the Wusong mouth. Ships sailing on the waters of the Three Gorges rushed into the Huangpu River for temporary shelter. Two small barges outside Baotaiwan were hit by strong winds and huge waves and struck the stone embankment. The hulls of the ships capsized, and all the crew fell into the water. Fortunately, they were near the embankment and were able to climb ashore. The cargo had drifted away and there was no way to salvage it. Utility poles and power lines in the Yunzaobang area of Baotaiwan on the shore were also broken in several places by the wind. It was said that the wind was still strong in the evening.</p>
<h3>The Sheng Family Property Dispute Engages in Reconciliation</h3>
<p>▲Both Parties Acknowledge Internal Strife as Wrong</p>
<p>▲Setting One Month as the Reconciliation Period</p>
<p>Sheng's two married elder daughters, Guan Yi, and others, following in the footsteps of their unmarried sisters, also retained a lawyer in the Provisional Court to request an equal division of the estate with their brothers and nephews, Sheng En Yi and others. At the previous hearing, most of the defendants did not appear, so the case was adjourned. It was originally scheduled to resume at 2:00 PM on the 11th, but the Sheng brothers, sisters, aunts, and nephews were quite aware of the wrongfulness of their internal strife and are now engaged in reconciliation. Therefore, the case was not heard again the day before yesterday afternoon. It is heard that the reconciliation period is one month. If it still cannot be resolved after the deadline, they will request a court ruling.</p>
<h3>The Arson Case at the Pharmacy Still Has Unrevealed Secrets</h3>
<p>▲An Elderly Man's Daughter Seeking Justice for Her Father</p>
<p>▲The Insurance Broker Is Not Without Connection</p>
<p>▲The Pharmacy Owner Has Also Been Located</p>
<p>▲Both Have Been Arrested and Are Awaiting Interrogation</p>
<p>The fire at the Guang Ren Tang pharmacy on Avenue Edward VII was set to collect insurance money. Afterwards, the police discovered the deception, and the pharmacy owner, surnamed Wang, fled with his family, knowing that the matter had been exposed. Then, Zheng Zhaoxiang, an Anhui native over sixty years old, turned himself in to the police, admitting that he was the manager of the pharmacy. The police sent him to the Provisional Court. After repeated interrogations, it was determined that the pharmacy was indeed set on fire, and Zheng was sentenced to seven years in prison. This was reported in this newspaper. On Friday morning of the previous week, after the verdict in the case was announced, a woman in her late twenties, claiming to be Zheng Zhaoxiang's daughter, arrived at the entrance of the Provisional Court. She stated that she had learned of her father's involvement in the lawsuit in her hometown and had come specifically to appeal. Now that she heard that he had been convicted and imprisoned, she believed that he had been deceived by the insurance broker, "Limpy" Su Si'en. She negotiated with Su there, but to no avail, and dispersed. However, the woman was unwilling to give up and learned that the pharmacy owner, Wang, was wanted by the court. She began investigating Wang's whereabouts, believing that if Wang could be brought to justice, the truth would come to light. Until late the previous day (the 11th), she finally discovered that Wang and his family were hiding somewhere in the French Concession. She hired lawyer Ni Jiong to report to the Xinzha Police Station. The police chief sent detectives to the address and arrested Wang. Under interrogation, Wang implicated Su Si'en in many places. The detectives then arrested Su and brought him to the police station. The woman decided to wait until the police sent Wang and others to the Provisional Court for questioning, and then retain lawyer Ni to request a retrial for her father, so that he could be exonerated.</p>
<h3>A Fire Broke Out in a Noodles Shop on Xinzha Road Yesterday Morning, and a Shop Assistant Was Burned to Death</h3>
<p>▲Four Residents Were Injured</p>
<p>A fire broke out at the home of the Zhang family at No. 33, Lane 1, Beixingli, Xinzha Road, near the North Mud City Bridge, at around 3:20 AM yesterday. The neighboring houses at Nos. 34 and 35 were also affected. After receiving a message at noon, the Central Fire Brigade immediately drove to the scene to put out the fire. Because the fire was very fierce, the entire building, including the main room of No. 33, was burned down. A man named Yu Funan, who rented a small room in the attic, was burned to death. His recently arrived niece was also asphyxiated and lost consciousness.

<h3>A Peddler of Fancy Clothes Narrowly Escaped Mistaken Assassination</h3>
<p>▲Three Bandits Fired Shots to Resist Arrest</p>
<p>▲Admitted to Carrying Out Assassinations</p>
<p>Zhang Weizhang, a peddler of the Dasheng Fancy Clothes Shop in Beixinjing, was returning from inquiring about the price of cotton at the Kangxing Foreign Company in the French Concession at around 11:00 AM the day before yesterday. When the carriage he hired reached the west end of the Niupi Factory, two men suddenly emerged from the roadside, one wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, and the other wearing black clothes. They stopped the carriage and asked Zhang if he was carrying opium or a pistol. Zhang replied that he had nothing but a leather bag containing three silver dollars and showed them the bag. The two men said nothing and looked around and left. Afterwards, Zhang Weizhang was very suspicious and reported the incident to the Beixinjing Public Security Bureau and the Water Patrol Team. Upon receiving the information, Patrol Chief Wu led armed police officers, guided by Zhang's coachman, Zhao Yongkun, to the scene.</p>
<p>▲Firing Shots to Resist Arrest: Upon arriving at the destination, the police officers saw three men walking ahead, two of whom were dressed the same as the reported description. They immediately ordered them to stop to be searched. However, upon hearing the order, the three men scattered and fired shots at the police officers. There were about seven or eight shots in total. The police officers also fired back, but because of the rain and muddy ground, none of the shots hit. The bandits fled to the left. One of the bandits, fleeing to Wangjialou Creek, was arrested by the police officers. When the two sides were firing shots, the local self-defense corps also joined in the shooting and arrest.</p>
<p>▲Assassination Is Real: One of the bandits arrested by the police, Xu Yulin, approximately twenty years old and from Pudong, confessed that recently, a coachman, identified as a certain Jia, asked his friend Shen Abing to kill his employer with a gun, offering 200 silver dollars as a reward. Shen Abing then asked him to help. The three of them came by car. Shen Abing lived in a certain hotel on Wuma Road. It is heard that the person whom the bandits wanted to assassinate was surnamed Zhu, and also engaged in the fancy clothes business. Zhang Weizhang's interrogation by the bandits was probably due to a misunderstanding.</p>

<h3>Verdict in the Case of a Western Man Assaulting His Girlfriend's Father</h3>
<p>▲The Defendant Was Acquitted on the Grounds of Self-Defense</p>
<p>The Da Wan Bao reports that in the case of a Danish girl's boyfriend, a bank clerk named Maxwell, assaulting her father with a leather wine bottle, the British Assessor has given a verdict today (the 12th). The magistrate declared that the only matter to be judged in this case was whether the defendant, Maxwell, injured the girl's father with a bottle. After examining the statements of both parties, it was determined that the defendant was indeed at risk of being harmed when he struck with the bottle. His actions should be considered self-defense. The charges should be dropped and the defendant released. The issue of their cohabitation is not within the scope of this case. However, on the matter itself, it seems appropriate for the girl's parents to reconsider their opposition to the marriage. This is the only proper course of action at present.</p>

<h3>Inventor Mr. Gillette Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Gillette, General Manager of the Gillette Safety Razor Company, and his wife arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Hong Kong for a tour and are staying at the Cathay Hotel. Mr. Gillette is 75 years old this year and is in good spirits and is an excellent conversationalist. According to his own account, the history of the invention of the Gillette safety razor is awe-inspiring. In 1895, he was a salesman for FBaltimoreSealCompany. One day, when he was about to shave, he saw that his old razor was dull and unusable. He suddenly had the idea of a safety razor, so he purchased materials from the Pierce equipment store and made a very crude razor. His friends all disapproved of it, but he was determined to research it intermittently for five years until the company was established in 1901. At that time, the initial capital was only 5,000 US dollars. After that, the business gradually developed, unprecedented. In 1904, the company's area was only 6,000 square feet, but now its Boston factory covers an area of 600,000 square feet. In 1906, the company's net profit was 408,000 US dollars, and by 1928, the net profit had increased to more than 16 million US dollars. As of October 1, 1929, its total surplus was approximately 138 million US dollars. In 1903, the company sold only 51 razors and 14 packs of blades. To date, it has sold 105 million razors and 5 billion blades. Mr. Gillette usually enjoys traveling. This is his first trip to China. He plans to stay in Shanghai for a few days and then travel to Hangzhou, Nanjing, Beijing, and other places.</p>

<h3>Runaway Wife Files Counterclaim for Divorce</h3>
<p>Court Severely Reprimands</p>
<p>Husband is Ordered to Take Her Back and Control Her</p>
<p>Tang Senhe, from Taixian, Jiangbei, works as a fireman on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and lives on Datong Road, Zhabei. His wife, Tang Liu, is 23 years old and has a little beauty. She used to be a silk factory worker. At first, they lived in peace, but in the winter of last year, she suddenly changed her behavior and secretly had an affair with Qin Jinsheng. It was no longer a matter of one night. On the third day of the twelfth lunar month of last year, she used the excuse of shopping and left and never returned. Her father-in-law, Tang Shoushan, and her husband, Tang Senhe, searched north and south but could not find her. Until last month, Wang Zhaohua went to see Tang and his son and said that Tang Liu was now living with Qin Jinsheng. Because Qin was widowed and waiting to remarry, they could not bear to be separated, so Qin Jinsheng was willing to pay 120 yuan as Liu's price. If they objected, it would be difficult to recover her, like returning a pearl to Hepu. Tang Senhe was furious when he heard this and replied that he could earn more than 30 yuan a month, which was enough to make a living. Were they asking him to emulate Lu Yachen's story of selling his wife? He left unhappily. Tang became more and more angry, feeling that his wife had been taken away and it was difficult to tolerate. So he asked someone to draft a complaint and filed a lawsuit with the Procuratorate of the District Court, accusing Qin Jinsheng of illegally occupying his wife Liu and demanding a thorough investigation. The Procuratorate ordered Qin Jinsheng and Wang Zhaohua to be arrested and interrogated. Qin denied inducing and occupying Liu, but Tang Senhe insisted that his wife was actually hidden by Qin Jinsheng. If he made a false accusation, he was willing to accept the punishment. He also requested temporary detention. The court ordered the three defendants to be detained together and ordered Tang Liu to be arrested for further verification. The next day, Qin requested to be released on bail pending trial. Unexpectedly, Tang Liu hired lawyer Zhang Guohua to file a lawsuit for divorce with the Civil Court of the District Court. The trial was held by Judge Zhao the day before yesterday. First, Tang Liu stated that she was 23 years old and had been abused by her husband, Tang Senhe, making it difficult to live together, so she ran away on the third day of the twelfth lunar month of last year and was now working as a helper. The judge asked where she was working as a helper, but she could not answer. The judge asked how she was abused, and she replied that he beat her. The judge asked if there were any scars or if she had ever been examined for injuries, and she replied that the injuries had healed, so she had not been examined. The judge asked how old she was when she got married, and she replied that she was 17. The judge asked if she had ever had children, and she replied that she had had three children, but they all died prematurely. The judge asked when he beat her, and she replied that he hit her with the sole of his shoe in the room on the first night of the twelfth lunar month. Now he is in Wuxi and has married a concubine, and they have had a child. The judge asked how she knew, and she replied that he told her himself. The judge asked if anyone else heard, and she replied that they were talking in the room on the bed, so how could outsiders hear? The judge asked if she was having an affair with Qin Jinsheng, and she replied that there was no such thing. Next, Tang Shoushan stated that he was 52 years old and lived on Datong Road, teaching for a living. The judge asked why his son Tang Senhe was not present, and he replied that his son was detained in the Procuratorate. Then, Tang Ying stated that she was 54 years old and Senhe was her son. The judge asked if her daughter-in-law was usually good, and she replied that she was good and did not commit adultery. The judge then ordered the court clerk to bring Tang Senhe from the detention center to the court. Tang Ying suddenly stood up when she saw her son in court and cried out, "My good child, you are suffering!" Her tears streamed down her face with unbearable grief. Tang Shoushan shook his head repeatedly and sighed, saying, "Marrying a bad daughter-in-law has put my son in prison and brought in-laws to court. Where is her conscience?" The judge then asked Tang Senhe about his age and occupation. He replied that he was 30 years old and worked as a stoker on the train, earning 32 yuan a month. The judge asked if his wife wanted to divorce him and what his opinion was. He replied that he did not want to. The judge asked when they got married, and he replied that they got married on August 16th of the thirteenth year. The judge asked if he beat her, and he replied that he did not beat her, and the scars on his hands were from frostbite. She ran away and had an affair with someone named Qin, so he filed a lawsuit in the Procuratorate. The judge asked if he had married another woman in Wuxi, and he replied that he had not been to Wuxi, so how could he have a woman in Wuxi? These words were completely fabricated by her. The judge asked if she was usually good, and he replied that she was good, she was young, and she was deceived by Qin. It was best to ask the court to prosecute Qin for inducing her to run away, but the Qin family had a lot of influence in Zhabei. Then, Sun Liu testified that Tang Liu was her cousin and she had advised her not to be deceived by others and that husband and wife should live in harmony and not quarrel often. The judge obtained the testimonies and said to Tang Liu that it was better to reconcile and for the couple to return to good terms. The judge ordered her husband to withdraw the criminal case and for her to return with her husband. Unexpectedly, she insisted that she would not go back and that she would rather be sued and executed. The judge said that her request had no evidence to support it and was simply unreasonable. If it were granted, the court would be overwhelmed with similar cases. The judge then ordered the two parties to go out and reconcile. If they could not reconcile, they would wait for additional witnesses to be called for further review. The court adjourned. Tang Senhe was ordered to be returned to the detention center. After Tang Liu left the court, she was dragged by her in-laws, Tang Shoushan and Tang Ying, to the Procuratorate to request an investigation. Prosecutor Liu proposed to investigate the case and briefly interrogated Tang Senhe and Wang Zhaohua. He severely reprimanded her and ordered her husband, Tang Senhe, to take her back and control her. Wang Zhaohua was released. Tang Senhe hired a car and took his wife Liu home. The couple, who had been separated for 70 days, were reunited. The lawsuit in the court came to a temporary end.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a Devoted Son's Suicide</h3>
<p>Wedding Soon Followed by Bereavement</p>
<p>Deep Love Led to Madness</p>
<p>Approaching Anniversary Intensified Grief</p>
<p>Dies by Smoking Opium to Follow Her in Death</p>
<p>Shen Kaowen, a farmer from Pengjiatang, west of Caohejing in Shanghai, is a man of modest means. He is over forty years old and his wife, Chen, has borne him three sons. The eldest, Jinming, is just twenty years old. The second, Shunming, was adopted out at the age of thirteen. The youngest, Shunyu, is only nine years old. Jinming is intelligent and had studied at a junior high school, excelling among his peers. Therefore, he was highly regarded in the school. Since childhood, he had been engaged to Zhou Shu-zhen, the second daughter of Jin Liusheng, a gentleman from a nearby family, through a matchmaker. They were married on March 18th of last spring. Shu-zhen was the same age as Shen and had also received primary education. She had bright eyes, white teeth, and a charming appearance. The newly married couple were enjoying their honeymoon when fate struck. Shu-zhen contracted a minor illness and unexpectedly succumbed to it. On April 21st, she passed away, her beauty extinguished. Jinming was inconsolable with grief, fainting several times. After Kaowen and his wife repeatedly comforted him and explained the situation in every possible way, Jinming dropped out of school. From then on, he spent his days weeping, feeling sorry for himself. More recently, he had been wailing loudly and speaking incoherently. Kaowen, seeing that his son's mind was disturbed, feared that it would lead to disaster, so he often spied on him secretly. At about 10 o'clock the night before last, Jinming suddenly changed his behavior. He lay down on a long bench in the living room and said miserably to his parents, "My death is near. The kindness of raising me for so many years has been wasted. Now that Shu-zhen's (referring to his deceased wife) anniversary is approaching, I should follow her in death and reunite again. After my death, I hope you will not grieve too much to avoid troubling my grandmother. However, dying in the room would scare my young brother, so I am lying on this bench to wait for death." Kaowen, seeing that Jinming's face was pale, knew that he had ingested opium. He tried to rescue him, but the poison had taken effect. He died around midnight.</p>
<h3>Young Girl in Love with Old Man</h3>
<p>Parents Unable to Control</p>
<p>Cuiying, the daughter of the late Gu Maodi from Hongqiao Town in Shanghai, is only twenty years old and has a fair appearance. She is of marriageable age. Her mother, Yang, loves her dearly. Recently, because Cuiying cut her hair and dressed fashionably, and indulged in love, she was severely criticized and strictly controlled by her stepfather, Gu Quansheng. However, Cuiying, feeling that her body was not free, ran away from home last fall. Quansheng and his wife searched everywhere, but there was no trace of her. Recently, they learned that Cuiying was being occupied by a Mr. Ji, who was nearing fifty, and was hiding in Changchun Lane, Maisaertiro Road. Yesterday morning, the Gu couple went to the address and found her on the spot. Ji was also in the room. However, Cuiying insisted on not returning and vowed to follow the old man for the rest of her life. Quansheng was also unable to control her and had to let her go. It is now heard that Mr. Ji has hired a matchmaker and plans to formally marry her within the next few days.</p>
<h3>Prostitute Unwilling to Continue Prostitution</h3>
<p>Files Lawsuit to Sever Relationship with Foster Mother</p>
<p>Gu Xiaomao, a woman from Hangzhou, was given to the woman Sun Lushi by her parents as an adopted daughter when she was young. When she turned fifteen, she became increasingly beautiful. The woman then transferred her to Fu A-er, a private prostitute in Hangzhou, to sell her body for two years. After entering the brothel, the girl felt that this life of selling smiles was not what she wanted and often argued with Sun Lushi. Because it was difficult to force her in Hangzhou, the woman tricked her into coming to Shanghai, saying that they would work in a tobacco factory. However, after arriving in Shanghai, she first made excuses that no one would recommend her, and then revealed her true colors, taking the girl to various game parks every night to seduce tourists, forcing her to sleep with them, earning two to three hundred yuan a month, which the woman enjoyed. Now the girl is twenty years old and does not want to constantly offer her body for others to play with. She repeatedly asked the woman to be excused from prostitution, but she not only refused but also beat and humiliated her. The girl felt that it was difficult to reason with her, so she appealed to the Women's Association of the Fourth District for help. She also hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Provisional Court, asking that Sun Lushi be punished for forcing her into prostitution and for profiting from it, and that she be allowed to sever her relationship with the woman so that she could regain her bodily freedom. The trial was held by Judge Zhou Xianjue on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. The defendant, Sun Lushi, did not appear. After Gu Xiaomao recounted the details of the case, Judge Zhou said that since the plaintiff's lawyer had filed the lawsuit based on Article 246 of the Criminal Law, it seemed inconsistent with the facts of the case, since the plaintiff in this case was the defendant's adopted daughter, and the plaintiff's purpose was to seek to sever her relationship with the defendant, which was a civil lawsuit. The judge then ordered a postponement and waited for the defendant to be brought to court for further questioning.</p>
<h3>A Woman With Four Husbands</h3>
<p>A woman surnamed Ren from Tongzhou, currently twenty-eight years old, was betrothed by her parents to the son of a Mr. Fang from the same village when she was four years old. She immediately went to his house as a child bride. At the age of nine, she returned to her mother's home. As she grew older and her intelligence developed, she began to feel that her fiancé was quite a scoundrel. Feeling depressed, she voluntarily went to the Jiliang Institute (a home for women) and requested to be taken in. Later, Ling Rensheng, an acquaintance, bailed her out. They fell in love and began living together. When she was twenty-one, Ling suddenly passed away. Lacking support, she had no choice but to come to Shanghai to work as a maid. Before long, she became acquainted with Zhang Xin'an, a carpenter from Haimen who lived in Xieqiao. They lived together for three years, but Zhang had a violent temper and often abused her. Therefore, she secretly became involved with Chen Hongsheng, a coppersmith from Hubei, and moved in with him at No. 1, Yanjia Alley, Zixia Road. After Ms. Ren's disappearance, Zhang searched for her without success for more than four years. Yesterday, at around eleven o'clock in the morning, he happened to pass by that road and ran into Ms. Ren and Chen. He immediately grabbed her and called for Constable Du Tianxiang of the Eleventh Guard Post, who took them back to the Third Precinct of the First District. After preliminary interrogation by Chief Jin, they were ordered to be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for further investigation.</p>
<h3>### Su Xintian Sued By Wife For Neglecting Alimony</h3>
<p>The Judge Used All Sorts of Parables</p>
<p>Both Parties Reached an Agreement in Court</p>
<p>Su Xintian from Ningbo and his brother Shoutian were sued by Su Yangshi, Xintian's wife, who hired a lawyer to the Provisional Court, alleging neglect of alimony and other matters. According to the statement, she married Xintian and gave birth to a son. Later, due to his taking a concubine, they became estranged. Xintian repeatedly abused his concubine, using it as an excuse to create trouble. After mediation, a separation and alimony agreement was signed in the first month of the twelfth year (of the Republic), with Xintian paying Yangshi 150 yuan per month. His brother Shoutian made a note of it and allocated 10,000 taels of silver to Shoutian for interest, which would serve as a guarantee for the alimony. Shoutian also issued a deposit slip, which was handed over to Yangshi. It was said that from the signing of the agreement, in the years Guihai and Jiazi, he was able to pay as agreed. However, in the year Yichou, he began to default, one after another. As of the time of the lawsuit, in addition to receiving 1,605.3 yuan, the rest was ignored. Despite entrusting a lawyer to send letters to urge payment, they went unanswered. The aforementioned alimony was Yangshi's necessary funds for daily life; how could it be in arrears, forcing her to borrow to make ends meet? The child she bore also had no funds to hire someone to take care of it. And Yangshi was sick in bed, allowing the child to play on the road, where it was hit and killed by a car. The funeral expenses were all borrowed from relatives and friends. Shoutian neither paid interest monthly nor did Xintian care about alimony. Therefore, she requested that the 10,000 taels held by Shoutian be transferred to a well-known bank in the city, and that the arrears of 150 yuan per month for living expenses, except for what had been received, be paid in full by Su Xin. If there was a shortfall, it should be made up by Xintian. In addition, Shoutian had swindled a full set of pearl head jewelry, worth 1,400 yuan, which she requested be returned. After several court hearings and attempts to resolve the matter out of court, the two parties could not reach an agreement. The day before yesterday afternoon, the court opened again, with only Su Xintian present. After questioning by Judge Qu, he still advised both parties to reach an agreement in court. The plaintiff, Su Yangshi, insisted that the defendant had the means to pay, such as shares in the Shanyin Farm in Ningbo and the Sucunded Pharmacy, and also hundreds of acres of land. The defendant claimed that the Shanyin Farm had already been mortgaged, the pharmacy shares had also been sold, and the land was not much. Judge Qu advised the plaintiff to concede, using all sorts of parables, and drafted settlement terms, such as the defendant paying the plaintiff 3,000 yuan, with 1,000 yuan to be paid within ten days, and the rest to be paid in two installments, with four months per installment. The ownership of Yishan Farm would belong to the plaintiff for sale, and 2,000 yuan from the sale price would be used by the defendant to repay the mortgage on the farm. Until the farm was sold, the defendant would continue to manage it on behalf of the plaintiff, paying the plaintiff 600 yuan in interest per year. Both parties had no objection to these conditions and signed their names. After more than three hours, the case was settled by agreement.</p>
<h3>Ginseng Rejuvenation Pill Harmless</h3>
<p>The Yang Brothers Made a Fuss</p>
<p>A Mr. Yang, who lives at No. 2, Lane 2, Xinchangli, Caishi Street, French Concession, currently runs a catering business. His younger brother is engaged in the clothing business. The brothers have always had a good relationship. Recently, his younger brother wanted to open a clothing store outside and asked his brother for 200 yuan in capital. His younger brother happened to have a friend give him a Ginseng Rejuvenation Pill. The younger brother took it back and respectfully offered it to his older brother. Yang, after drinking alcohol the day before yesterday, swallowed the pill. After a while, he felt dizzy and thought that the pill contained poison. He reported it to the police station. Detectives were dispatched, and Yang was sent to the hospital for treatment. His younger brother was taken to a teahouse to find the friend who gave him the pill, but he could not be found. He was taken to the police station. After Yang arrived at the hospital, doctors examined him and diagnosed that he had not taken a poisonous pill but seemed to have heatstroke. He was immediately given medicine and recovered. He was discharged from the hospital and returned home. The police station released his younger brother, closing the case.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, Upon reading your newspaper today, I was astonished to see a report about Zhou Heting, a foreman at the Tianlun Silk Factory, fighting with a female worker. After investigation, it was found that on the morning of the 11th, Zhou Heting, the head of the factory, wanted to fire a female worker named Liu because of poor work. The female foreman interceded and persuaded him to allow the female worker to continue working. Unexpectedly, the female worker thought that her face was at stake. During the lunch break, she suddenly stopped Zhou Jun while he was unprepared and slapped him in the face. Zhou Jun, fearing that she was a gangster looking for trouble, turned around to leave. However, Ms. Liu was ultimately a woman and her feet were weak. She fell to the floor of the workshop. At that time, the female worker was not injured. The factory's security guard reported the incident to the security group, who immediately transferred it to the Fourth District Headquarters for legal action. The case is still under investigation. This is the actual situation at the time, which is very different from what your newspaper reported. I am writing to request that you correct the record as soon as possible. Sincerely, Tianlun Silk Factory, March 12th</p>

<h3>A Word of Wisdom</h3>
<p>— Long</p>
<p>The "my love" from a lover's mouth is like the "friendship" from a strong neighbor's mouth. Neither can be relied upon.</p>
<p>Chinese people are ruined by what they eat. They imitate foreigners in everything. However, they are falling behind in their careers. Therefore, the country is weak and the people are poor, and they are humiliated every year.</p>
<p>There are many people in society who earn more but are more in debt. This is because they care about appearances and do not economize. Their debt is at least ten times greater than their income.</p>
<p>If a poor man fails to borrow from three rich men in a row, he will definitely correct his past mistakes and work hard and frugally. Their gloomy faces and sarcastic tones can inspire him to do so.</p>
<p>A narrow-minded friend can only read Free Talk and not international news. This is because there are often reports of humiliating the country and losing power, which directly affect his eyes. Even if he doesn't burst with anger, he will get sick.</p>
<p>Your clothes may be old, but your shoes and socks must not be broken. This will ensure that no one calls you a pauper.</p>
<p>If you argue with the ignorant, those in the know will laugh at you for being one of them.</p>
<p>If a man and a woman can follow the right path to marriage, the result will be good. Otherwise, tragedy is likely to occur at any time.</p>
<h3>Revolutionary Elder Huang Heshun</h3>
<p>— Bi Ren</p>
<p>Revolutionary elder Huang Fu, courtesy name Heshun, was a close friend of President Sun. In the year before the founding of the Republic of China, the revolutionary army rose up again to overthrow the Qing dynasty and relieve the suffering of our Han people. At that time, Heshun lived in Macau. He received a secret order from Mr. Sun and gathered strong men from the mountains of Guangdong and Guangxi at night, preparing to revolt in Guangdong. In a few days, he had a crowd of 30,000 people. Then he launched the rebellion. He fought a bloody battle with Cen Chunxuan, the governor-general of Guangdong and Guangxi, for three months before pacifying the two Cantonese provinces. When the Qing court sent envoys to negotiate peace, Mr. Sun was the provisional president. Heshun did not take credit for pacifying Guangdong and submitted a letter of resignation. Although Mr. Sun repeatedly ordered him to take office, Heshun refused. When Mr. Sun went north to open the National Assembly, Heshun also came to Shanghai, but did not go north.</p>
<p>Heshun is now over seventy years old and shows no signs of decline. He is as energetic as ever. However, his family is very poor. His daily expenses depend on his wife's needlework. However, although he is poor, he goes to the Huiyuan Tea House on North Sichuan Road every morning and noon to drink tea, looking pleased with himself. When someone talks about the revolution, he leaves his seat. When it comes to other things, he talks eloquently and endlessly. Mr. Heshun is truly commendable.</p>
<h3>Listening to Mr. Hu's Lecture</h3>
<p>— Jing Xi</p>
<p>On the ninth day of the third month, the Shanghai YMCA Academic Lecture Society held its first lecture at the YMCA. The lecturer was Dr. Hu Shih. His academic theories have always been admired. More than 800 people attended the lecture that day. Because the venue was small, there was no space. First, a gentleman gave a speech and apologized repeatedly. He asked the guests to strictly maintain order in the venue and not to be affected by the crowding and affect the silence. Finally, he asked everyone wearing a hat to take it off to avoid catching a cold. His words were quite humorous and thought-provoking. Mr. Hu stood up and the crowd applauded loudly. The topic of the lecture was "Observing the Current of Thought in China Today from New Literature." It lasted one hour and twenty minutes. The following is a brief summary: "In Shanghai, a city of 2 million people, there are no good academic research societies, libraries, or theaters to raise the people's thinking.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Gleanings</h3>
<p>Do not throw away records related to lawsuits or the addresses of relatives and friends in the wastepaper basket. You must prevent paper collectors from picking them up and falling into the hands of bad people, which will lead to endless harm. Therefore, it is better to burn them with fire to avoid future troubles.</p>
<p>Buy canned foods from large stores because they sell well and the goods are fresh. If you go to small stores, you are likely to buy stale goods. I have been cheated on this matter before.</p>
<p>If you go to a greengrocer to buy vegetables and forget to bring a scale, do not ask the hawker to weigh them. You can find a cook and ask him to weigh them for you. It will be much cheaper.</p>
<p>If you encounter rain on the way, you can run into a large store and buy a cheap and beautiful household item. You can hide from the rain. The exhibition hall of the Commercial Press is a good place to take shelter from the rain and there are books to read.</p>
<p>Chinese people's thinking has always been "unthinking thinking." The ancients worshiped Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius. Modern scholars are vigorously promoting Marx, Lenin, or Kropotkin. Everyone agrees. Without thorough research and full understanding, it is just using them to replace Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, Zhou, and Confucius. The biggest problem with Chinese people is that they rely on hearsay and lack real vision to see through and think deeply. They follow the majority's right and wrong. Their minds are like mirrors reflecting people. They see beauty as beautiful, ugliness as ugly, and pockmarks as pockmarks. They do not think or research, asking what is going on. Therefore, church schools are bound to invade culture, missionaries are bound to invade religion, and capitalists are bound to exploit workers. They do not ask whether every missionary and capitalist is like that. They draw a few talismans and recite a few spells, overthrowing them. Everyone responds. No matter what the situation is, they are all lumped together with talismans and spells. The American Ford does not agree with Marx's capitalism, but reduces workers' working hours, increases wages, and the price remains low. Ford still makes a large profit, which others cannot match. This is because his thinking is superior to others. Today's scholars of new literature in China use one or two abstract nouns to represent the whole problem, without asking about the country's social environment, people's customs, historical and geographical relations. They are lumped together and glossed over. The blind blindly follow. When asked why, they are all speechless. For example, Kang Liang and his peers discussed new policies, studying Europe and the West diligently, thinking that everything was right. They did not examine why it was right. They abolished the imperial examination and opened schools, thinking that there was no need for the imperial examination after there were schools. They did not know that schools were places to train talents, and the imperial examination was a place to select talents. This shows that the examination system cannot be abolished. Today, students have diplomas from universities and colleges, master's and doctoral degrees. If they do not have wealthy and powerful relatives and friends, they cannot get a position, creating a bad situation. Scholars rarely "think about thinking" about things, repeatedly researching and citing evidence, and opening up new paths. For example, the bad habit of foot-binding for Chinese women has been passed down for thousands of years. In those thousands of years, less than half a dozen people opposed it. Talented scholars and talented men thought that three-inch golden lotuses were beautiful and moving, even writing poems about them. It can be seen that Chinese people's thinking is based on the majority's approval or opposition. The blind lead the way and the blind follow. It is still the same today. Therefore, I hope that everyone can see clearly, determine right and wrong for themselves, and not blindly follow others.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu's speech was clear, solemn, and humorous. The audience laughed heartily at the humorous parts. Unfortunately, I cannot record everything.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Eating</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>German physiology doctor Li Jia once served in the military during the European War. After experiencing the life of gunpowder smoke and bullets, and seeing the corpses and brains on the ground, he felt compassion and wrote the book "On Anti-War," which was circulated around the world. He continued to use science to investigate human beings' love of war and killing, but could not find the reason. Recently, he suddenly realized that he gave a lecture at the Berlin Biological Society, saying that human beings' love of war and killing is actually related to eating beef and drinking milk. People in the West all use beef and milk as essential nutrients. Cows are good at fighting, often killing each other. Humans eat their meat and drink their milk, so human nature is leaving and cow nature is coming. Over the years, generations of children continue to be born without realizing it. Therefore, the atmosphere of peace has changed into clouds of war, and the world is never peaceful. Either a weak country is swallowed by a strong country, or a small country is eaten away by a large country. The death of people cannot be counted. The cruelty is unbearable to speak of. Therefore, to avoid world war, it is appropriate to abolish eating beef and drinking milk in order to restore human nature. At one time, the listeners were all moved. The society was organized by members to promote non-eating of beef. Many people responded. This kind of sound wave will soon spread to the eastern and western continents. This is truly the gospel of mankind. My friend Xu Zhaohong told me in a letter from Berlin that the words were not false. Therefore, I recorded it as a source of information for Free Talk.</p>
<h3>Recording Lice Crabs</h3>
<p>— Yan Qian</p>
<p>Lice are produced in the Huangpu River from Zhagang to Wuku. They only appear in early spring when the weather warms up. The period is very short. After Qingming, they are gone. Their size is only as small as the so-called "sand shell" small coin, so they are called lice.</p>
<p>Fishermen cast huge nets on the bottom of the river when the tide has not yet risen. They wait for the tide to fall and raise the nets. They can get countless lice crabs. When they first enter the market, they cost more than 1,000 yuan per catty. They are also a rare delicacy at the time.</p>
<p>The way to eat them is very peculiar. First, grind them into a mud paste with a small mortar. Then, put them in a bag made of thin cloth to drain the juice. Then, mix it with duck eggs and fry it into crab paste egg skin. The reason why duck eggs must be used is that duck eggs are more elastic. Frying egg skin is better than chicken eggs.</p>
<p>The mud paste can be drained twice after the first draining. The drained juice can be used to cook soup, which is called crab paste soup. The juice is very turbid when it is drained. It is unsightly. When the soup is cooked, the crab meat coagulates into a paste and the soup is very clear.</p>
<p>There is another way to eat them, which is suitable for drinking alcohol. First, wash the lice crabs and slightly soak them in salt. Then, wash them once again. Then, soak them in aged wine and high-quality soy sauce. After half a day, they can be eaten. When eating, add ginger and scallions to mix. Chew the shell and swallow the juice. It really has a different flavor.</p>
<p>Finally, there are two words to tell the reader. If you get lice crabs, you must use heavy seasonings to remove the fishy taste when cooking. Otherwise, you may end up complaining that the crabs are only in name. Secondly, in addition to the two ways to eat them mentioned above, you may as well use your own creativity to create a more delicious dish. You do not have to stick to the rules.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes in Nanyang (5)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>Customs officials search very carefully. The population tax is very heavy, but the export tax is very light. French goods are often duty-free. This shows the benefits of the colony. Regarding books and writings, if there is anything unfavorable to France, the people are detained and heavily fined. Even if there is no writing about the relationship, if the review is not clear for a while, people will not be free. Therefore, travelers do not dare to bring books. Only science textbooks can be brought. But the Three Principles of the People used to be banned, but now it is not.</p>
<p>Before arriving at the port, police came to inspect the passport. You must check to be allowed to go ashore. The first three classes must have a passport. The fourth class is not necessary for workers. However, business people who go ashore must pay a poll tax of three yuan per month, ranging from thirty to forty to fifty to sixty per year. The better ones have to pay more, which is called preferential treatment. It is said that women only pay a few yuan, or that they do not have to pay. I don't know the details. Children under the age of sixteen do not pay. Our people are all heartbroken when they talk about this matter, saying that it is a failure of diplomacy. They sigh at each other. The workers who came on the same boat, some men and women, with children, were looking for food abroad and complaining at the same time. On the one hand, they must still rely on people to make a living, just like the Jews. The most unbearable thing is that France does not tax the Japanese, but only the Chinese. Annamese people also pay six or seven yuan per year.</p>
<p>The roads near the pier are dusty, like Nanjing. It is not as good as the Huangpu River. The bridge structure is quite good, slightly similar to the Shanghai Outer Bund Ferry Bridge. There are many boats in the river, mostly black and old, similar to the boats in Guangdong. The boatmen are indigenous people, mostly bare-backed and bald in the hot sun. After crossing the bridge to the Saigon bus station, take the tram to the bank. The first class is one corner and the third class is seven points. Tram passengers all have seats, unlike the crowding in Shanghai and Japan. The ticket checkers are French, indigenous, and Chinese. They come and go like shuttles. It is very different from the ambiguity or oil in Shanghai trams. The drivers are Annamese, with a leisurely and elegant attitude, unlike the ticket sellers in Shanghai trams, who are not educated at all. They scold customers at random. Recalling Chinese trams, Tianjin is the most orderly, followed by Beijing, and Shanghai is the worst. It is purely a foreign slave style, and it is even lower than the Annamese. The managers of Annamese trams have the Japanese style. Their ticket sales are different from ours. There are small rooms selling tram tickets every one or two miles. The ticket window is a small hole, three or four inches square. You must buy and sell before boarding. I and Mr. Chen were once in a hurry. Chen jumped on without buying or selling. So the two of us were fined one solution (there is no small ocean here). I said that this is another loss of ignorance, so I know it is most valuable.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (147)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Nine, the celebrities make a fuss about playing hide-and-seek, and a beautiful girl indulges in protection</p>
<p>What do you say that Yiqing the Fourth caught at this time? But what did he catch? But he caught Zhi Zhen Cuixia, who had just drawn the short straw for him. Speaking of it, it was to avenge the revenge just now. In fact, Zhi Zhen Cuixia's being caught was due to her good intentions. It turned out that several of her little sisters were hiding in that corner of the wall. Seeing Yiqing stretching out his hands and grabbing randomly in the opposite direction, it was a bit ridiculous. Suddenly, he turned around and pounced on the traces. That group of delicate crows seemed to be scattered and flying in panic from among the flowers. In a hurry, Su Jun covered them up. On this side, there was a pot of half-sized foreign roses. The foreign roses were originally planted in a yellow sand pot. The outside of the yellow sand pot was covered with a colorful porcelain pot. Although the colorful porcelain pot was new, it was not a Kangxi kiln or a Qianlong kiln. But it was not a rough pot. There was always a pair. A friend from Jiangxi brought it and gave it to Shi Guanping. The two pots of foreign roses were in the two colorful porcelain pots. They fit just right. The bottom of the colorful porcelain pot was a long-legged flower pot stand. Su Jun saw Yiqing pouncing on him and was very fierce. If he wanted to escape, he touched the frame of the pot of foreign roses with his hand. Originally, because the flower frame was too high, the flower pot on it was heavy, and the frame below was light, it was a little shaky. Now it could not stand a touch, and even the flowers and pots fell together. Fortunately, Zhen Cuixia was right next to him and quickly held up the pot of foreign roses so that it would not fall. Therefore, Yiqing came over with his hands outstretched and had no time to escape. He was caught by him. He let out a cry in his mouth. No matter who it was, he had finally caught one. He grabbed it. He pulled down the handkerchief tied to his eyes. When he saw Zhen Cuixia, he said, "Oh, it's you. You just drew the short straw and wanted me to do it for the first time. Now I've caught you." Zhen Cuixia said, "I was holding up the flower pot. Otherwise, it would have fallen down and broken." Yiqing said, "I don't care. Now that I've caught you, I'll have you do it. I've got a substitute ghost. I can't spare you anymore." At this time, Zhen Cuixia wanted to escape but couldn't. Yiqing and Yun Lai and others tied his eyes tightly with the square Indian silk handkerchief with seven hands and eight feet. He was also pulled to the side of the wall, and he was about to pat the wall three times. Then he turned around and caught people. Yan laughed and said, "Cuixia, this thing is more troublesome than acting on stage. Walking with your eyes tied is even more difficult than walking on stilts." Zhen Cuixia's blind man's catch was indeed worse than that of Yiqing the Fourth, because he didn't have Yiqing the Fourth's body. It turned out that when Zhen Cuixia was young, he felt very good after putting on makeup. He felt that his eyes were very beautiful. Such a figure would be taller if he were on stilts. After taking off his makeup, his body was slightly swollen. After all, men were not as slender as women.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Bar Market Without Major Changes</h3>
<p>Slight Fluctuations Finally Rise Slightly Yesterday, the 12th, the gold bar market saw slight fluctuations, starting firm in the morning, weakening at noon, seeming to turn stable in the afternoon, and ultimately rising, though the overall market had a difference of four taels and several mace, the psychology of the industry remained hesitant, with differing buying and selling interests. Companies like Fuchang, Yuanheng, Wanxing, Yuanmao, and Yonghengxing all made purchases, while those selling short positions included Yuancheng, Yongyuan, Shengyu, Dafuxing, and Yongsheng. As for foreign exchange, it stabilized and then recovered. Early market saw a contraction in large amounts, and the exchange rate still rose, so the market quickly strengthened. This was due to Japanese banks absorbing cash, which boosted the market. Furthermore, as foreign exchange trended towards loosening, and major players sold off, the price suddenly plummeted, breaking the 90 tael mark, falling from 93 taels to 88 taels and change. Afterwards, the market was relatively stable, with fluctuations of only two taels and change, hovering around the 90 tael mark. However, foreign exchange was closed as usual on Wednesday. The final price stood at around 91 taels yesterday. The near-term silver price did not change, while the far-term price decreased by 16/3. The silver price, however, increased by 1/4, and the exchange rate increased by 1/16.</p>
<p>The morning market was hesitant and soft. The April gold bar market opened high at 490 taels and 0.02 tael, an increase of 0.005 tael from the previous day. It then fell from 490 taels and 0.05 tael to 89 taels and 0.03 tael. Later, Yongkang, Wanxing, and others competed to buy, and banks also purchased cash. At the time of the first telegraphic transfer rate announcement, the peak was 92 taels and 0.23 tael, but there were no changes to the official rates and the internal structure was stable. In June, the Bank of England bought at 11 pence and 0.6875. This month, Mitsubishi sold to HSBC at 11 pence and 0.5625, which has now risen to 93 taels and 0.01 tael. At this time, many parties were selling, and it suddenly dropped to 91 taels and 0.45 tael. After 10:00 AM, June British gold was traded between Andah and Mitsui Mageri at 11 pence and 0.6875, with more buyers, so it increased to 92 taels and 0.56 tael. Afterwards, some in the industry sold off British gold, but banks were not eager to buy, requiring 11 pence and 0.75 for June delivery. Japanese gold was also only 1 tael and 0.0225 tael. Furthermore, Yuda, Fuxing, Yong, and others leaned towards selling, so the price broke the 90 tael mark. However, from 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM, there were fluctuations of two taels, and then it weakened further, finally falling to 88 taels and 0.04 tael. The March Japanese gold could be settled at 1 tael and 0.02625 tael, and the June gold at 1 tael and 0.0225 tael, but sellers to banks would have to deduct 0.0025. June British gold at 11 pence and 0.8125 was difficult to sell. At noon closing, the price was 88 taels and 0.07 tael.</p>
<p>The afternoon market was calm and stable. In the afternoon market, the idle market was at 88 taels and 0.09 tael. Afterwards, active buying caused it to rise to 90 taels and 0.08 tael. Upon hearing that the Indian exchange rate was rising, it immediately fell by two taels and at 3:15 PM it was 88 and a half taels. Afterwards, it gradually rose, and Hengxing, Tongtaichang, Wanxing, and others were all buying, and the market trend became stable. It again broke through the 90 tael mark, but there were occasional fluctuations of one tael and change. However, the foreign exchange market lacked activity. After 4:00 PM, short sellers made entries, so the price was pulled up by one tael and change. At 4:30 PM closing, it was 490 taels and 0.08 tael, an increase of one tael compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The settlement price was a small 32 or 33 taels. Checking the highest price of the two sessions, it was 493 taels and 0.01 tael, and the lowest price was 488 taels and 0.04 tael, a difference of 4 taels and 7 mace. The listed price was still 522 taels and 0.06 tael, which was more than 33 or 34 taels lower. The account for the month was 88 taels, and the make-up water for the next month was 89 taels, and 88 taels. The initial listed price in the afternoon was reduced by 33 or 34 taels, and the final reduction was about 32 taels. Make-up water was 90 taels. Goods opened at 91 taels and 0.06 tael in the morning, closed at 89 taels at noon, and 89 taels in the afternoon, closing at 90 taels and 0.09 tael.</p>
<p>Speculative tendencies differed. Yuan Cheng, Yong Taixing, Yuansheng, Yuda Fuxing Yong, Xuchang, Shunli, etc. were all selling. Wanxing, Yongkang, Yuanmao, Yonghengxing, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Yuanxingyong, etc. were all buying. Yuantai, Yichang, Kunhe, Zhifengyong, etc. were sometimes buying and sometimes selling. The Dalian gang had balanced entries and exits, with approximately 2,000 transactions. According to the Guangzhou gang, there were 1,000 buy-ins in the afternoon, and the trading among the same industry was not as prosperous as in the morning. Yu Dayongchengchang, Fuchang, and retail investors all sold. Hengxingsheng, Dawangxingshunli, etc. bought slightly. Yuanmao, Yongda, Decheng, etc. mostly bought in. The Dalian gang bought 600 or 700 and sold more than 400.</p>

<h3>Yarn, Flower, and Cotton Yarn Market Declines and Recovers</h3>
<p>Actual Sales Continue to Be Prosperous... Continued Development in Later Steps</p>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose at noon. Actual sales remained strong. The situation was stable, and various parties had a strong intention to invest. There was still hope for the development of spot yarn transactions. Some people were watching steadily, but sellers did not give up the idea of shorting due to excessive underlying inventory. Overseas flower and yarn markets suddenly turned to rise. According to various trade groups, there was still a large amount of business in the later steps. In such a situation, it was difficult to excessively underestimate the market. Human mark market status was stable. The human mark market opened in the morning and rose by four qian with the rise of foreign cotton, but the situation was not very firm. In the second and third rounds, sellers continued to put pressure on near-term contracts. As a result, all months fell by 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, and 0.07. In the afternoon, there were reports of prosperous actual sales, and human sentiment seemed excellent. The market was dry, and buying was strong. All months rose by 0.04, 0.07, 0.08, and 0.09. Three-grade yarn also rebounded by three yuan. Checking the situation in the market, some people went long when the price fell, so the market trend was higher.

<h3>Cotton Market Rises with American Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market turned to rise, but actual sales remained bleak. However, American cotton suddenly rose, causing buying interest to strengthen.

The sources of supply from all routes remained scarce, and the future remained difficult to predict.</p>
<p>The cotton futures rebounded by 0.035. The Han mark market opened in the morning, and the market atmosphere was bland. Because major players were selling and adding codes, all months only rose by 0.005 to 0.01. The Han gang continued to purchase. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere suddenly tightened.

<h3>Anglo-Japanese Conspiracy to Monopolize the World Cotton Goods Market</h3>
<p>Indian Cotton Cloth Tariff Seems to Be the Key to Success or Failure</p>
<p>The competition between British and Japanese cotton merchants is becoming increasingly fierce. The British Consul in Osaka, Mr. Basque Kemmis, proposed to Mr. Yamada Mu, Vice President of the Japan Cotton Association, that British and Japanese cotton merchants should divide the market, agree on sales prices, and divide operations by type of goods to avoid unnecessary losses due to competition. The Japanese side paid close attention to this issue. Although there has been no concrete indication, all expressed agreement with the main point. This matter is of great importance to the Chinese cotton industry. The situations of both parties are recorded below in order to clarify the contents. The purpose of Mr. Basque's proposal is to ease the competition in the world market between British and Japanese cotton industries in order to stabilize the cotton industry. The content remains secret, but it is rumored to be the following three main points: (1) "Agreement on sales areas for cotton products." In order to avoid the mixed war between British and Japanese cotton goods sales in China, India, Nanyang, Africa, the Near East, and other places, the respective regions should be agreed upon and not violated by each other. (2) "Agreement on sales prices." In order to avoid losses due to the calculation of the original price caused by competition between British and Japanese cotton goods in various markets, it is appropriate to agree on sales prices for important products. (3) "Agreement on the quality of exported products."</p>
<p>The two countries each estimate the needs of overseas markets and determine the types of goods to be exported in order to avoid increasing inventories in the market and causing a decline in market prices. British cotton merchants have been planning this conspiracy for a long time. The distant cause is nothing more than the strong influence of workers, which has led to rising production costs and declining efficiency. Japanese cotton goods not only have the potential to dominate the Pacific, but also greatly expand their power in the Near East and other places, which has greatly affected the British cotton industry. The recent cause is that Japanese cotton industry groups have also actively sought to revitalize exports, and the competition between the two countries in overseas markets has become increasingly fierce. This time, Mr. Basque's proposal was initially nothing more than a private probe, but now it is gradually becoming a public issue. According to Mr. Basque, who once made the following statement, this problem is being carried out in extreme secrecy and has consulted the wishes of many cotton industry stakeholders. It is clear that it is not in the interests of both parties for the British and Japanese cotton industries to only focus on competition. If coordination can be maintained, both parties will benefit. Therefore, the cotton industry really needs world coordination, as do other industries such as shipping. As for the specific coordination plan, it can be negotiated by the two parties in reality. Although this coordination is not without some difficulties, it is not impossible.</p>
<p>Japanese cotton merchants have paid close attention to this issue. Although there is no concrete indication, there are the following opinions from generally related parties, stating that the prevention of losses and waste caused by fierce competition of cotton products and the promotion of international co-prosperity of the cotton industry is the spirit that is most welcomed by us and there is no reason to reject it. However, one cannot help but feel that there are many difficulties in the practical means of preventing useless competition. It seems possible to agree on the issue of sales areas, prices, and quality in an abstract observation. It is extremely difficult to conduct a problem study for realization. If coordination can be achieved with other means based on international friendship and in the spirit of an open attitude, it may be expected. Furthermore, with the spirit of fairness, starting with resolving the Indian cotton cloth tax issue, the benefits to the British and Japanese cotton industries will be very great. Furthermore, according to the observation of a powerful person in the Japanese cotton industry, Japan is happy to accept this international friendship proposal, but how to deal with it is a matter for research. The general observation is that (1) the realization of the agreement on sales areas may not be difficult. For example, the markets of China, India, and Nanyang belong to Japan, while the Near East and Europe belong to the United Kingdom. However, the agreement must not only be based on the current exports as a ratio, and the estimated amount of exports that the Japanese cotton industry is preparing to supply to the world market must be included in the calculation. (2) It is difficult to agree on the calculation discrepancies and technical differences between the two countries.</p>
<p>In view of the Japanese people's advocacy, they mostly express their approval of this issue. However, the increased import tariffs on Indian cotton cloth have dealt a major blow to Japan. Therefore, Japan is currently resolving the Indian tariffs as the first step in this coordination, and the future success or failure is still difficult to predict at this time.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, Huangbai Factory Business Sales Prices Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market gradually showed signs of clearing and flattening. The decline in the Yokohama Japanese silk market has stopped. The European and American markets are not selling silk well, and telegrams are sparse. Yesterday, only Taihe and others entered Shanghai with 20 bales of Baichang warp, Anqi and others entered with 10 bales of Lu Huangchang warp, and Meida entered with 5 bales of Sichuan swing warp. The prices were still stable.</p>
<h3>Southern and Northern Goods, Hunan Lotus Root Sales Stagnant and Falling</h3>
<p>Recently, Hunan lotus root has been stagnant, the market has been flat and tired, and it has gradually turned down. Compared with the previous market, it has been a small three taels and Xu Hankou's spot market is also tired. According to the letter, the high price is not more than 20</p>
<h3>King Wang Ironware Sells Well in the Northern Provinces</h3>
<p>Ironware trading: Although there was light rain yesterday, transactions were still extensive. Due to the general trend towards peace and stability in Shandong, Beiping, and other regions in the north, numerous telegrams arrived requesting additional orders. Consequently, the volume of goods handled for these provinces was the highest of all. Items such as English steel plates, black iron sheets, French horseshoe nails, pig lead, tinplate, angle iron, and cut iron were all traded. It is also reported that significant quantities of garden lead wire and new lead wire were ordered. Market conditions showed little fluctuation. Local factories primarily traded in tinplate and black iron sheets yesterday, while trading in other types of goods remained normal.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Prices Decline Again</h3>
<p>Price drops by five cents... Demand remains quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market telegrams indicated that the current price of Cuban raw sugar remained at $2.00. New York sugar futures for March were $1.73, a rise of three cents from the previous telegram, May at $1.78, September at $1.86, each also up one cent, and December at $1.95, up two cents. The current price of Javanese raw sugar was 10.25, with no change. March futures were priced at 10.375, and April at 10.50, also up 0.125. The Association's market valuation of Dutch sugar, grade 24 raw white, saw very little buyer interest, and the market turned weak. The initial asking price was still 7 taels, 1 mace, and 5 candareens, but due to lack of demand, the market later fell to 7 taels and 1 mace, though there were some transactions. The market was flat and lacked vitality. Grade 20 was quoted at 6 taels and 9 mace and 5 candareens, but there were few takers. While transactions in Japanese sugar were active, demand was not strong. Z mark was priced at 7 taels and 7 mace and 5 candareens, YT mark at 7 taels and 6 mace and 5 candareens, and YP at 7 taels and 8 mace. The market showed little sign of improvement.</p>
<h3>Coal and Coke Prices Soar</h3>
<p>A shortage of various types of coke has persisted in this port for almost two months, with virtually none available on the market. User demand is quite urgent. Recently, the Osaka Warehouse received over 200 tons of Xiaojiao coke from a certain coal company, with the selling price rising by more than 5 taels per ton. This type of coke was sold last year for only 14 taels and 5 mace per ton, but yesterday it opened at 19 taels and 5 mace per ton.</p>

<h3>Market News</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Rubber Industry's Measures to Increase Market Prices, according to the Shen Bao, on the 22nd of last month, Chinese rubber plantation owners and merchant representatives held a meeting at the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and decided on measures to increase rubber market prices: (1) Suspend leasing land for rubber cultivation for five years;</p>
<p>(2) Levy an export tax on rubber based on its value. The use of this rubber will be determined by the British and Dutch governments. A telegram was immediately sent to the London Rubber Growers' Association, requesting that the above measures be petitioned to the British and Dutch governments, and expressing that the Overseas Chinese rubber industry is willing to cooperate with the Association's proposal to increase market prices if it suits local conditions. Similar telegrams were also sent to the British and Dutch Rubber Association, the Malayan Planting Association, and the Malayan Chinese Chamber of Commerce in London. In addition, seven committee members were elected to form a committee to investigate and report on all rubber-related matters and the best measures to be taken, and to liaise with the Malayan Planting Association and the Asian Planting Association to request their assistance in petitioning the government to implement the above-mentioned measures. The meeting lasted four hours, during which Mr. Tan from Malacca gave a speech, stating that all parties should work together to devise a solution to the current situation of rubber, with the aim of suiting local conditions, as many small companies lack sufficient funds, and whether the government can assist is of great importance to the future. He also stated that Asian rubber planters should unite and cooperate with the Dutch East Indies Rubber Growers' Association, just as the British side is asking for help from the Dutch side. It is now reported that the committee has decided to request a meeting with the British Governor to exchange views on the decline in rubber market prices.</p>
