<p>日本學制。將由縱而改爲横。質言之。即爲由精深主義而改爲實用主義。蓋縱之學制。其始之淺近者。不過爲以後精深者之預備。假使學生不能完全之敎育。中途而止。雖未必無用而能合於實用者有限。若横之學制。則每一學級。皆可以自成段落。而所學者。皆可施諸實用。今人以應用爲務。此日本學制所以有大改革之議也。</p>
<p>世界萬事之進化。其始必因時勢所需。力量所及。自然而發展。其繼必因各自發展不能整齊劃一。而用理想之方法。强爲劃一。其後又以理想方法之劃一。不合於實用。致多枉費。乃復以實用爲主。於合於實用之中。求整齊劃一之道。此進化之順序也。今世學制之變遷。亦即如是。</p>
<p>抑又有言者凡一制度而能節節可分節節可合。時時可斷。時時能續。分各有用。合更力大。斷不枉費。續更力長。則其制度。方爲萬全。行之而有益無害。是不僅限於學制然也。</p>

<p>▲蔣夢麟致開會詞</p>
<p>敎育須注重地方需要</p>
<p>政治統一思想要統一</p>
<p>諸位先生、諸位代表、今爲第二次全敎開會、蒙各省代表位專家光臨、非常榮幸、此次與第一次有兩點不同、特提出報告、（一）各省有縣市敎育局之代表、其目的爲切近地方種種問題、足以討論解决、（二）此次提案不由各地代表提出、此次由中央預定衡量、今日及將來需要、編成方案、從前之提議、範圍太廣、着手非易、猶之一敎育百科辭典、不知從何讀起、此次方案、希望二十年中推行、故今次所提出者、爲比較最重要者、其成功與否、須本國之工商業發展與否斷、方案經中央核准後、希望各地因地製宜、努力進行、全國敎育界、共同向此進行、方克有濟、</p>
<p>近來敎育界、獨立甚多、（一）有一散漫現象、缺乏中流砥柱之精神、今後吾人宜有一貫之精神、以改造敎育、（二）近來學校與社會、不事溝通、畢業生難以適應社會需用、此種弊病、實因敎育不問社會情形、故學校雖推廣而實效未見、近有人謂經濟無來路、人才無來路、中國敎育界、似有此種情形、所以希望今後、之學校、應於全社會需要、（三）邇來辦敎育者、眼光太不一致、或以學習科目之異、或以地位之不同、故其結果、不能得以全國眼光、看全國敎會、今後亟宜以全國眼光、看全國敎育、（四）先進國家敎育設備、應有盡有、羅馬非一日造成、我國萬不宜盡效外國、亦步亦趨、須確定適合本國之步驟、以便適用、</p>
<p>因之此次方案、欲彌此缺憾、擬定一共同標準得循序漸進、惟敎育須賴政治穏定方可、故我人一方應創造治重心、俾全國人民得以集中意志、統一精神、一方應創造學術重心、使靑年之思想統一、不致悮人岐途、由此以觀、吾人應有改治之統一、思想之統一、然後可以如古語所云、譬如北辰、衆星拱之矣、最後吾人更須牢記總理最後之遺訓、和平奮鬥救中國、</p>
<p>▲譚延闓訓詞</p>
<p>希望有系統辦法</p>
<p>各地方遵此實行</p>
<p>今日爲第二次敎會開始之期、第一次議决案雖多而詳盡、但實行不易、故此次第二次敎會、先由中央預定方案、爲比較有系統者、以便各位來此詳細討論、現在各方面均希望產生有系統之辦法、使各地方得以遵此實行、如能切實辦到、則前途當有希望、</p>

<h3 id="c112">對於第二次全敎會議的感想　·孫·貴·定 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>這次敎育部爲遵照上年二中全會的决議案、在首都召集全國敎育會議、目前時局雖不甚平靖而各省區的代表等、都能按時報到、表示在敎育上全國確實統一、誠是一種可喜的現象、不佞前曾於十七年間列席大學院召集的第一次全國敎育會議、這回又忝爲會員之一、因此感覺到這次的會議和上次的會議、有許多不同的地方、歸納起來、似乎這次的全敎會議、有三個特别的優點、</p>
<p>（一）第一次全敎會議在開會之前、徵集各方提案很多、不論什麽問題、祗要有人做個提案、一經審查通過後、便作爲大會討論的根據、那種辦　　▲大會職員</p>
<p>（自右至左）編輯科主任鄭天挺、文書科主任趙迺傳、招待科主任楊芳、庶務科會計科主任姜紹模、日刋編輯主任彭百川、</p>
<p>（南京光華攝）</p>
<p>法、當然有集思廣益的好處、但也不免意見龐雜、缺少有糸統的討論、這次的會議、便不是這樣、所討論的範圍、以敎育方案編製委員會所製成的方案爲限、這種方案係敎育部集合許多專門學者、經過很精密的研究而編成、不但是根據目前實在的情形、注重應用、並且成一完整的糸統、開會的時候、逐步把他作爲共同討論的根據、按部就班、有條不紊、當可收事半功倍的效果、</p>
<p>（二）照這次會議的規程、每省得指派市縣敎育局長或市縣敎育科長一人、出席會議第一次全敎會議、每省祇有敎育廳長及廳外敎育專家一人有出席的資格、兩相比較、覺得這次的辦法、確是好些、因爲每省於敎育廳長之外、加派市縣敎育局長或科長一人、對於各省區地方敎育的實際情形、更可明瞭些、會議的時候、亦可處處從實施方面着想、不致有所隔膜、而犯空疏或迂闊的弊病、</p>
<p>（三）第一次全敎會議、對於華僑敎育、雖曾通過議案數起、但並没有十分注意、至於蒙藏敎育、更視若化外、無人過問、這次的會議、便大不相同、關於華僑和蒙藏敎育、特聘專家六人、出席會議、在敎育方案編製委員會所製成的方案内、特加改進並發展華僑敎育計劃和實施蒙藏敎育計劃、以爲開會時討論的根據、此外又於審查委員會内添設華僑敎育和蒙藏敎育兩組、以上種種辦法、均足表示第二次全敎會議、重視華僑及蒙藏敎育的一斑、</p>
<p>根據上述的種種優點、我們推想起來、這次會議所獲的結果、比較上次會議的成績、當能更加優美、希望這次會議開過之後、全國敎育、能切實改進、我們所渴望的心理建設、能早日完成、</p>
<h3 id="c113">改進並發展華僑敎育計劃編製的經過和要點 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>吳研因</p>
<p>敎育部敎育方案編製委員會、本有「華僑敎育組、」正在進的時候、中央黨部訓練部召集華僑敎育育會議議决一切、該組主任便聲明旣有華僑敎育會議的决議、就可以不必編製關於華僑敎育的計劃了、後來該組委員、除少數人開具意見外、都没有把該項計劃交卷、</p>
<p>在中央華僑敎育會議之後、該會議决案全部送到敎育部、委員會覺得全案不但格式和方案的格式有異、内容也不十分完全、所以由常務委員另推人員起草、草成後、又經幾度的修改才成了現在的計劃、</p>
<p>這項計劃、把中央華僑敎育會議的决議、全部容納在内、當時便發生了一個疑問、就是「華僑敎育會議的决議、旣經由中央執行委員會議决交辦、政府便應該照辦、何以又要編在方案中提交全國敎育會議呢、」這疑問的答案、便是這次的方案、是整個的、凡中央歷次的决議、未曾實行的、都一一編入、華僑敎育會議的决議當然不必例外、而且這計劃中、凡華僑敎育會議所議决的成交、前後都加號、表明未便更改、</p>
<p>至於本計劃的要點、也已由全國敎育會議籌備委員會編輯科、分别提出、不必再說了、但有幾點要說明的、</p>
<p>（一）這項計劃、文字上和華僑敎育會議的决議、有不同之點、而且内容方面也有節略或補充之處文字的修改、是不得已而且也有所根據的、原案是文言文、方案全是語作、這是文體不得不變更的原因、再則華僑敎育會議、開會時、再三聲明、文字有不妥當處、當於會議閉幕後、重行整理、但交到敎育部的、仍是原案的文字、實未曾認眞修改過、那麽再加修改也並不是無的放矢、好在文字上的改變、本來無關弘旨的、只要内容不變、即使改得更不妥當也不妨至於内容、例如原案關於領事管理華僑敎育事項、忽將領館應召集華僑團體和敎育界舉行紀念週一端具體辦法、與調查指導監督提倡的抽象任務並列、實在覺得不倫不類、所以關於紀念週一節、除由敎部訓令各領事遵照外、計劃中便節略了、又如原案華僑敎育會本是人民團體之一、但其職權中却把關於華僑敎育的設計事項和指導事項都列入、在華僑敎育設計委員會和領館敎育專員指導華僑敎育之外、另有了設計指導的機關、組織是疊床架屋、職權易混亂衝突、所以計劃中也便節略了、計劃中把原案節略的地方、有好多處、但於原案的本身、並無妨礙、因爲原案的精神和價値、本來不在這些上、又如原案關於中央、每年所撥五十萬元和一千萬基金利息的用途、如何支配、由何人支配、都未規定、這計劃中便加以補充、規定由華僑敎育設計委員會設計支配、這些似乎是要緊的應該補充的、</p>
<p>（二）有人以爲這劃大體很好、可是關於學校敎育一節、說得未免太多了、應該删繁就間、單說一些重要的原則、其實這一節、是根據改進初等敎育計劃的格式編製的、華僑學校的設置·組織·建築設備·訓育·課程敎材·敎職員·學生·輔導制度、都有切實規定的必要、因爲所謂華僑敎育、除了行政設計外、學校敎育實在是一個極重要的重心、而且華僑學校比較國内學校、遜色多多、亟待改良、這計劃中如不把這一部份詳細規定、那便是失却重心了、有人說、計劃中把原則規定了、方法可以讓敎育行政者和學校當局各省設計的、不知原則是很籠統的、很籠統的原則、往往令人無法施行、例如說敎員應該登記、而不說登記的方法、敎員應加保障而不說保障的要點、這不是令人無從實行嗎、要計劃實行、非說得週到些不可、内容雖不必過於詳細、但是進行的手續、辦理的方法、應注重的要點、這都是不能不規定的、</p>
<p>（三）許多研究華僑敎育的人、對於原計劃的組織節、大槪都能滿意、但以爲重心所在、在於敎育部應設華僑敎育司、或華僑敎育行政委員會、但是實際的重心、並不在華僑敎育司或華僑敎育行政委員會、而在指導華僑敎育的領館專員、）或敎育部選派的巡、迴指導專員、）和華僑敎育會、因爲華僑敎育的最高行政敎育部本也負責主辦法的、和設專司或委員會舉否、並没有多大關係要是設了專司、或委員會、而海外領館不設敎育專員（或不派巡迴指導專員、）各地方不設敎育會、這就等於没有脚的蟹、鞭長莫及、做得出甚麽事來呢、否則海外旣有專員直接指導、又有敎育會、相助辦理、敎育部只要總其成而已、不設專司或委員會、也没有甚麽大妨碍、海外敎育專員和各地敎育會、是直接督導華僑敎育的重心、華僑敎育能否改進和發展、全賴乎此、這是我們應該認淸的、</p>
<p>此外我們應該知道的、敎育不是單純的問題、和一切政治都有關係、要是其他的政治建設没有辦法、敎育也决不能單獨的有辦法的、這一個原則、對於華僑敎育、尤覺得顯著而確實、華僑敎育、應由國家的政治力量扶持、倘使政府不能扶持、華僑敎育的生命、斷不能延續到十年二十年以外、不要說甚麽改進和發展、所謂國家政治力量的扶持、也並不是敎育部單方面所能爲力的、除敎育部外、至少還需要兩方面的巨大的助力、</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>（一）外交方面、海外華僑學校、除美屬外、英荷日法各屬都受壓迫而不能自由、荷英法各屬對於華僑學校、施以駐册等取締的苛例、這是大家知道的、新近荷屬政府不許我國領事經理華僑敎育、我國領事在僑校舉行畢業式時、出席給憑也受荷政府的警告、至於不許學校行紀念週、敎授三民主義等、那更是日常的常事、台灣日政府、則併且不許設立華僑學校、如要設正式學校、（除私塾外）一定要以日人爲校長、敎授日文、華僑學校、在這情形之下、如何能夠維持、更何能夠改進發展呢、即使有方案、有計畫、且定將得詳細週到、無以復加、但又有甚麽用處呢、所以一切方案計畫如要實行、首先要在外交方面能得勝利、所望外交當局不要以爲華僑敎育非份内事、對於華僑這項交涉、便畏縮退讓、敷衍了事、應該自動的調查各屬地對於華僑敎育的態度和方法、隨時分别交涉、並注意於修條約時、加入保護華僑敎育的部份、以期盡力保障華僑敎育、</p>
<p>（二）經濟方面、華僑在海外、因爲政府無暇保護、而華僑自己又没有大規模的組織如經營能力所以商業漸趨失敗最近菲列濕馬尼剌僑界、就因此而影響到敎育經費、本來繳納的敎育附加捐現在有許多人不願繳納了、所以各僑校大起恐慌、陳嘉庚也因橡皮營業不振、幾幾乎無力維持他所辦理的厦門大學和集美學校、以此類推、可見華僑營業失敗、華僑敎育便難維持、維持尙難、何况改進發展呢、要維持並且改進發展華僑敎育、不能單在敎育的本身設法、因爲政府即使年撥五十萬元、再籌足基金一千萬而支用其利息、也學杯水車菥、不能挽回華僑敎育的末運所望政府在撥欵補助華僑學校之外、並努力設法保護僑商維持其營業、日本政府對於海外商民營業、往往特别補助、以利其與外國義爭、橡皮事業一項、牠們每年也補助四五百萬日金、所以他們的橡皮業、能夠在中國奪去陳嘉庚的市場而致陳嘉庚公司營業衰落、我國政府鑒於此事、應該設法援助僑商、或給以補助費、或派工商專家往海外各埠導其營業、或减免其費物人口稅、或由外交當局設法對外交涉、解除其營業上的種種朿縛、否此此後僑商必不能在海外立足到十年二十年之久、受影響的、豈但是敎育一端而已、</p>

<p>（丙）選拔全國的天才兒施以各級義務敎育案　　（一）理由</p>
<p>（一）天才兒、是一國的精英、將來一切的建設事業、都是出於他們的手、在没有財力去實施普遍的義敎以前、如果能夠在全國可能的範圍内、精選天才兒去施各級的義務敎育、初等中等高等用力甚微、成效甚著、也算是事半功倍了、而且這一班優秀的份子、將來在社會上的貢獻、如能以金錢的單位去代表、一定是大大超過他們敎育的耗費、放大眼光一看、天才兒的敎育、不但是眼前救濟的政策、而且此種制度有永遠存在的價値了、</p>
<p>（二）民治的國家、需要領袖、領袖的產生、不是以出處爲根據、而是以才力爲根據、這一班天資過人的兒童、如果没有相當的敎育、去啟發其天才、就不能充分發表他們的智能、有的竟然因爲惡環境所誘惑而走入歧途、消極方面是浪費天才、積極方面、竟可以用其才力去爲非作惡、這就是國家治安上一種障礙、反之如用理想的法子去敎育他們、就可以增加社會的效能、</p>
<p>（三）領袖的人才、必須有領袖的人格、如没有好的敎育、或流於放縱、或成爲自私自利之徒、一旦得到高位、就要利用以滿足一己的慾望有如歷來一般的軍閥、選拔天才兒去敎育、就是去養成我們將來人格高尙的理想領袖、</p>
<p>（四）天才兒不但是將來羣衆的領袖、由且有一部份、是將來學術的領袖、他們是創造者發明者、將來文藝上的貢獻、科學上的發見、物質文明的進步、生產的增進、都要靠他們的力量、</p>
<p>（五）若選擇時用稍高的標準、假定爲每百人中一人、（智商在一三０以上者）則全國總數、並不很大、此種經濟的擔負、應當是國家之所能勝任、</p>
<p>（六）據美國加州紐約沃各地中小學所附設的天才兒特别班試騐的結果、成績十分顯著、而經費不必增加、因提早畢業的緣故、有時反减少經費、則此種設施、確是敎育上的經濟了、</p>
<p>（二）辦法</p>
<p>（一）由敎育部聘請敎育專家、定下天才的標準及原則、並編制測騐的工具、擬定進行的手續、及敎育的方針和程序、</p>
<p>湖南敎育廳長黃士衡</p>
<p>（南京光華攝</p>
<p>（二）各省請富有經騐的敎育家若干人、根據所定的標準、到各城市各鄕村調查天才兒、學校内的天才兒、當然容易引起調查員的注意、但這不過占一個很少的數目、他們應當也要想法調查未入學的兒童、使不至有遺珠之憾、</p>
<p>（三）選取的手續、應當用最經濟而又最精密的方法、不然規模如此之大、將成爲不可能的事了、</p>
<p>（四）選取的標準宜高、則人數不至過多、國家方能勝任這個經費的負擔、</p>
<p>（五）經選取之後、未入學者應即令進學校、程度可入中學或大仐而無力升學者、應令全部免費入學、家境十二分淸寒的人、並應酌量發與書籍文具等補助費、</p>
<p>（六）天才兒所進的各級學校、應當有特殊的設施、使他們有自由發展的機會、不至爲普通的兒童所牽掣、</p>
<p>（附註）有的人以爲這種的辦法、是不合於平等的精神、實在并不然、「人類生來是平等的」一句話、是宗敎家自騙騙人的話、因爲社會上不平等的現象、是如此顯著、故不得不藉詞以自慰、並以安人心、實在那裏有這麽一回事、最不平等的就是天賦能力的高下、天才同白痴、是極端顯著的現象、但這種現象、又是最無法可想的、旣然無法可想、我們樂得趁此機會利用一下了、凡是一種有組織的團體、每個份子的地位、不能無差别的、有了差别階級就產生了、這又有甚麽法子去制止呢、這種有組織的團體、需要不同的人才、最高的地位、又不能不讓給最高的天才了、天才的產生、旣然是按照自然的定律、而社會又不得不借重天才、則我們選取天才、而施以各級的義務敎育、就是利用天才、去加增社會的效率、并不是去增進階級的制度、</p>
<p>▲中小學應設特别班案</p>
<p>（一）理由</p>
<p>（一）個性間差别之大、已經科學方法的證實了、所以同是九歲的兒童、一個在二年級裏還感到困難、一個已經可以進六年級了、現在學校的制度、多半是以年齡的大小、及就學日期有的長短分班、不是以能力分班、而且敎學方面的股施、都是按照普能兒童的能力、至於低能兒及天才兒、都没有顧到、這種敎育的影響、祇及於中庸一部份的人、兩邊極端都没有得到同等的好處、這是敎學上一種很大的浪費、設了特别班之後、就可以消除這種的浪費了、</p>
<p>（二）義務敎育是個個兒童應享的權利、不是專爲中庸的兒童、雖然低能兒天才兒、及中庸的兒童、同樣盡納稅的義務、但是大家没有享到同等的權利、這是錯待了低能兒及天才兒、</p>
<p>（三）低能兒在一班之中、總是落後、終日遑遑然跟在同學的後面跑、不管如何努力、所得的結果、仍不免失敗、羞憤怨嘆之餘、必流於怪癖或悲觀、天才兒因爲功課太容易、不能使之奮發向前、其勢必至養成懶惰的習慣、而且長居人上、不勞而獲、也可以養成一種傲慢的心、這都是有背於培植人格的原則、但若設立特别班、則低能兒就不至相形之下、自愧不如而生絶望之心、而天才兒亦可以與能力相等者競爭、而不至於萎靡不振了、</p>
<p>（四）學校裏的科目、多半是文字的、是符號的、是抽象的、低能兒缺乏了解抽象東西的能力、所以文字上的敎育、往往是徒勞而無功、如果將低能兒納入特别班中、分開敎授、則能用一種適合他們能力的敎材敎法了、（未完）</p>

<p>梁氏之死。乃由於心臟麻痺所致。當其彌留時。知覺已失。方二寸無序。遽於八日晨七時四十分。暴卒於滿海警備司令部内。其馬弁林某。隨待於旁。而先發見者。即此人耳。迨近十時。噩耗乃傳遍滿市。市民相率泣曰。「梁將軍死矣」。言竟。痛哭失聲。幾如喪考妣焉。是時天色陰翳。冷風習習。凉氣侵人。午後一時許。大雨傾盆。一若天地亦爲之含愁而灑淚者。傷哉。</p>
<p>梁氏有名駒。每出必乘。自氏卒。駒乃終日悲嘶。不飲亦不食。駒殆有知。痛失其主歟。</p>
<p>梁氏性慷慨而好義。濟貧拯困。無時或已。故其部下聞此噩耗。莫不搥胸揮淚。其馬弁林某。尤哭之慟。竟暈倒三次之多。梁氏之遺愛感人若是。悲夫。</p>
<p>梁氏彌留時。衣絨衫襯衣及毛氈各一。所蓋之被。亦僅棉製而已。卒後。有爲之整理什物者。於牀側覓得一包件。外裏以白紙。上有血書「紀念物」三字。審之。然一八寸長之利刃也。惟此刃之發現。可想見梁氏昔日出没於戰地。進退於槍林彈雨之塲。其殲敵之奮勇。不禁令人肅然起敬也。</p>

<p>夫因聾而使機械無聲。此不可能之事。至於汽車。其發音時度。或可略平限制。而行者方面。究屬發生危險。殊感不便。又據會中人云。紐約全市工塲。不下千數。煤烟濃重。時有飛屑滲入耳膜。積久閉塞。亦足形成聾象。此尤顯著者也。現該會專爲防止喧聲起見。對於各種工廠。非常注意。預料十年以後。特質上必有重大之變化。否則紐約將變爲世界一聾城矣。</p>

<p>省垣有糖菓茶食肆極多。就目力所及。計得稻香村凡三十一家。憶上海及江浙内地之稻香村。亦可不謂不多。大致均爲蘇帮商人所經營。而冠以姑蘇稻香村字樣。獨瀋陽反是。冠姑蘇字樣者。祇二三家。雖其經營亦南中人士。但非蘇州而以紹興籍占多。故他日關外之好味人士將漸知古越而不知金閶。而我人常觸眼簾之姑蘇稻香村字樣。豈漸將易爲古越稻香村歟。</p>

<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>同行之酈慈悲女士。暈船嘔吐。此人外並無華照應。陳君甚憂之。因到新嘉坡以西。舟中華人漸少。而其到法國馬賽。尙須二十八日。吾與陳君到新加坡。均下船。頗有西出陽關無故人之慨矣。陳君爲耶敎徒。遇事熱心。出錢出力。無不至。凡同行者均受其益。而招待酈女士尤爲周至。甚難得矣。酈亦耶徒。二人對於余講佛學。頗揶揄。余亦承認。與兩人辯論曰。今佛徒多爲懶蟲式之印度化。較之耶徒淸潔勤愼。遇事奮勇。得耶穌犧牲之力多矣。雖然。佛敎應進化與平民同工作。去其腐惰可也其長處又大有在耳。安見佛徒之終於無用耶。惟今日坐食自命天人師者。爲負社會供養矣。然則偶像和尙代表佛敎之命運將終局。而科學平民化之佛敎其代興乎。</p>
<p>談次。陳君忽言。君言誠是。余在緬甸久。知近年緬甸佛敎之趨勢。亦大變化矣。余曰。如何。曰。有緬僧名宇耶者二人。其一通英法各語。屢次運動獨立。結果下獄數次。聞今逃於中國。將入俄國去。又一僧亦名宇耶。今正與英政府抵抗。下獄斷食六十七日。以激起緬人之同情。竟死獄中。緬民十萬。舉行大追悼游行會。且印度甘地。亦派人參與其會。共同爲抵抗運動云。余曰。君可知佛徒非純然消極。印度化亦非純消極。觀於此二僧之一死一逃。蓋尙可有爲也。</p>
<p>下午船上發號令。大家習敎命圈。此乃以蔴袋裏一種輕木四塊。略如戰士所帶子彈袋然。掛於頸上。凡在三等客人以上者。均習之男女老小同出點名排隊。由指導者敎練。小兒則用小者。婦女抱兒掛於兒頸。但此有重要海規。必遵守。若有緊急。男子不許搶先下船。船主即有司令之權。以手槍指揮。先先婦女下船逃生。若男子誤爭先下。即以手槍斃之。此海規也。按此點亦是坤化主義。尙柔不尙剛。寗犧牲剛者以護柔者。具見人道主義。余至此有兩種感想。昔五祖謂六祖曰。汝上船。吾渡汝。六祖接漿曰。迷時師渡。悟時自渡。今在救生圈中。只有自渡而已。惟自渡者乃可待人之渡耳。若自無力支持。此時更無他力可恃矣。又一感想。三等以上客人有救生圈。而以下散艙客人無救命圈。則眞生命價値。隨錢而定。豈不寃哉。</p>

<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>▲近代戲劇的裝璜（中）</p>
<p>二十世紀劇院的裝璜已經到了非轉換方向不可的地步了。這種變遷的主要原因。因爲事實上劇院慢慢地失掉了它的非個性的台景的性質而變爲一種集體之性格。將著作家扮演人和觀衆都加入在内。</p>
<p>這裏是要創造一種環境。一種空氣。少了這個。戲劇就不能令現象發生一種持久的印象。在劇台上也如在銀幕上一樣。行動和節奏應該在這種空氣中找得一個確切有結構的立場。</p>
<p>是以裝璜家職在不絶地使他將裝璜造成一種一致的和諧。免致失之貧乏與乾枯。以泯除觀衆的反感。</p>
<p>凡是聽一齣古典的戲劇。譬如Ｅｓｔｈｅｔ之類。裝璜所關甚少。幾乎可以全然不去管他。這是因爲依照古典劇的慣例。觀衆立身在表演的事物之外。他聽着。看着。評論着。而毫不發生一點動作。這是寫的對話文學。用台景更明顯地表現出來。更加上一點裝璜和服飾的「解釋」而已。</p>
<p>現代的戲劇却再不是這樣了。劇本。藝員。導演應該綜合一致。完全密合着以創造濃厚的空氣。并集中觀衆的注意力。而且要把到場人的本身忘掉而爲親處劇中人物的境地。尤其造成一種集體的動感。令觀衆雖欲不爲其中之一員而不可得。要達到這個目的。劇本與演員固然是重要。然而還要讓裝璜一步。換句話說。就是裝璜尤其重要。</p>
<p>這種傾向。不僅在戲劇中爲然。一切藝術中都有相同的運動發生。小說的作者。不在爲讀者講一段故事。而在令讀者覺得自己就是那位主角。畫家把他的畫面展開在觀衆的目前時不說。這是自然。我爲你們抄下來的。而是說。你們看這自然多麽奇異而美麗。···</p>
<p>所以今日的戲劇不再只把「動作」「言語」「佈景」「裝璜」平等的混在一處。而傾於一致使人不再以閱讀一個劇本爲滿足。必得聽。看和證實。就是說使觀衆也生活其中。這些原素在先是敵對的。而且也不常有人有意要把它們歸於一致。這些原素之力伴他力而生。這所謂「他力」雖是不容易决斷。但是第在你和知不覺中發生若大的作用。然則這「他力」是什麽力從什麽地方來的呢。</p>
<p>由演員而來的嗎。眞是鳳毛麟角。我們今日很少有莎拉裴娜Ｓａｒａｈ　Ｂｅｒｎｈａｒｄｔ·迪士　Ｄｕｓｅ摩奈須萊Ｍｏｕｎｅｔ　Ｓｕｌｌｙ這一流的人物。</p>
<p>由著作者而來嗎。也不是的。這是裝璜家。假如是奥奈爾Ｏ　Ａｅｉｌｌ滔萊Ｔｏｌｌｅｒ萊諾爾孟Ｌｅｎｏｒｍａｎｄ的著作。那末。裝璜只是作品的副產品。裝璜家也只好一步一趨地去照做。還有莎士比亞Ｓｈａｋｏｏｐｅａｒｅ莫里哀Ｍｏｌｉｅｒｅ的劇本。可以在灰暗的牆壁前開演也不感到裝璜之必要。但是假如劇本不是顯然易見的。則完全要裝璜爱着力。可說十分之九都是裝璜家的事。他能把作者和演員的能力更加顯露出來的。</p>

<p>▲不銹鐵代鍍鎳部分</p>
<p>▲散熱器改爲狹長式</p>
<p>▲採用小車輪之大胎</p>
<p>▲車身式樣更進美觀</p>
<p>福特汽車爲保持價廉與巨量製造之地位。不若别種汽車之時常更改式樣。如Ｔ式福特汽車。其式樣幾賡續十餘年。直至一九二八年始改爲Ａ式。Ａ式出產迄今。已達二年。最今乃又有更改之計劃。現已實現。在美國已有出售。但此項新車尙未有運來中國之消息也。</p>
<p>此番福特派車之更改。在實際之機械部份。並無變化。僅於外觀之車身方面。略增美觀。故各地經理福特汽車之公司。於原有未脫售之車輛。除雇客之傾向於趨時者外。不致有滯銷之影響也。</p>
<p>一九三０年新式福特汽車之最顯著者。爲採用不銹鐵以代鍍鎳部分。按汽車車身之裝飾美。第一要式樣玲瓏。第二要色彩燦爛。現今各汽車所用之油漆。皆係都科漆。無特出之新漆。其他車身上之金屬部份。曆來用鍍鎳者。至一九二八年已有多數汽車改用鍍鎳。鎘之色彩爲靑白色。較鎳益光輝。但Ａ式福特汽車並不追隨别種汽車而效之。仍採用陳舊之鍍鎳。大衆皆以爲福特之太守舊。實則以福特之財力與製造能力。雖鎘之價値較鎳稍貴。若採用鍍鎘。並非不可能。蓋福特頗具製造革命之精神。實不欲追隨他人之後塵。此次毅然採用不銹鐵。廢棄鎳與鍍鎘。爲自來汽車製造界之始創者。將來别種汽車。必效法福特汽車之採用不銹鐵矣。</p>
<p>新式福特汽車　六窗四門轎車</p>
<p>不銹鐵爲合金之一種。其色如白錫。不論濕氣或酸質。俱不能便之生銹。其質堅而不脆。富展延性。可鎚擊爲各種式樣。其光輝柔和。不若鎬之過於剌激。且鎳鍍與鍍鎬。僅在金屬上敷鎳或鎬一薄層。經多次之磨擦後。此敷蓋之鎳或鎬。即有消滅之一日。不銹鐵則無此弊也。按近代冶金業。本有一種合金名不銹鋼。其性質與不銹鐵相仿。但因製造不易。與價値昻貴之故。除以之製造上等刀叉外。不嘗爲汽車製造界所注意。此次福特汽車廠之採用不銹鐵。據稱爲該廠之新發現。製造成本　　車頭之側觀</p>
<p>不昻貴。但製造方法則極守秘密。故外界現尙不知其成分爲如何。即在福特廠所在地之地德羅地方。僅知此不銹鐵之新　　車頭之正面</p>
<p>名詞曰阿爾芬納金屬（Ａｌｌｅｇｂｅｎｙ　Ｍｅｔａｌ）耳。</p>
<p>新式福特汽車之車身輝光部份。如散熱器壳。如電燈罩。如輪轂。悉用不銹鐵爲材料。其色彩之新奇。爲今日汽車隊中之突起異軍。</p>
<p>其次福特汽車之更改部份爲散熱器。其式樣較舊者狹而長。增加美觀不少。其他爲採用小車輪大車胎。現今車胎尺寸爲２９Ｘ４　７５英寸。車身之式樣。因散熱器增高後。兩側之腰線。自車頭至車尾。得引成一直線。車身之長並未增加。但以車頸短線後。車身内部較前稍寬云。</p>
<p>新式福特汽車除照舊之六種式樣。即二種蓬車四種轎車外。復新添六窗轎車一種云。</p>
<h3 id="c218">美國兩大汽油公司合併記　·程·志·政 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>▲美孚與眞空公司歸併</p>
<p>▲汽油市塲感重大威脅</p>
<p>我們也許都知道吧。美國有兩個偉大煤油公司。一是美孚公司。一是眞空公司。兩公司的資本。都異常雄厚。差不多各地全有分公司的。現在。一個好消息告訴我們了。原來這兩大公司。已實行合併了。這件事傳出之後。汽油市場。陡然風雲色變。波浪所及。一定有重大的影響的。因此不憚辭費。將這次合併的經過。詳情。記些告訴讀者諸君。</p>
<p>原來美孚和眞空的合併。醞釀已很久了。經過幾個月的協商。雙方董事會纔把這個問題决定了。說起這兩公司的性質。實在有合作的可能。因爲紐約美孚行的出品。多半用粗油。造煉出來的汽車油和煤油。眞空公司呢。是有名的機器油出產者。各處機器上用的滑潤油。大部是由它供應的。美孚行的營業。以美國爲主體。眞空公司則以海外爲大宗顧客。這兩點的不同。更顯得出互相提携的必要。這兩大公司的歷史極其悠久。在海外樹立了很雄厚的根基。眞空公司的分公司。有澳大利亞·埃及·南·東西非洲。以及歐洲。以及歐洲各部。這幾處美孚行的勢力却没有達到。它却在遠東·近東·印度等處。有極大所蓄油池。如此雙方一合併。勢力便可達到全球了。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>在美國汽油市場　　而論。兩公司合併。尤其有意義。因爲現代營業的趨勢。多注重於一個公司而同時供給各種出品。換句話說。就是自粗至精以及其他的出品。都應當由一家經理。如此一來。出品纔可以獲得相當的經濟。而可以和同業競爭。本鶆美孚和眞空。各有所長。也各有所短。短處是美孚不長於機油眞空缺乏於精品。今兩公司合而爲一。自然這種困難。全迎刃而解了。美孚行最近的計畫。將要用全部力量來發展汽車油。因爲汽車的在今日。他的重要已無庸諱言。因汽車的發達。汽油也成爲不可少的燃料。從前因爲受他種出品的限制。所以還不能貫注精神來謀汽油的偉大發展。如今。他種出品有眞空公司擔任。美孚自然可以無後顧之憂了。此刻正在謀内部的改組。並且要注意到全國的大廣告計畫。</p>
<p>合併以後的情情怎樣呢。第一。新公司勢力。將達到百分之九的全國油類消耗量。和其餘的競爭大同行可以勢均力敵。國外情形。也差不多。合併書議定之後。又請求政府備案。政府發交法院審查。結束兩公司准予合併。改名爲通用火油公司（Ｇｅｎｅｒａｌ　Ｐｅｔｒｏｌｅｕｍ　Ｃｏｒｐ·）通用火油公司可以有兩公司全部生財。由公司另發股票。凡眞空公司老股票一股。可換新股三張。美孚公司股票。照價掉新。董事會另行推選。但兩公司人數須一律相等。財產之中。以好感一項最爲値錢。其餘商標等也極可觀。所謂好感。（Ｇｏｏｄ　ｗｉｌｌ）就是公司的名譽。也可說是牌子。這種本是空虚無物的東西然而偏偏最値錢。這在美國是常見的。</p>
<p>就以上看來。可見得美國兩大公司的合併。可以有不少的影響。以公司本身說。雙方互相提携。互相調劑。對於抗拒外界的競爭。勢力極爲雄厚。在汽油市塲上說。各同行聽了合併的消息。當然感覺到絶大的威脅。因可分明又來了一個勁敵了。　　　户呢。也許可以因此而獲得許多便利。同業競爭愈劇烈。價錢總可以好些。即使價錢不便宜。至少服務要週到些。所以就我們用户立塲上說。對於此番兩公司的合併。是絶對表示十二分的贊同的。</p>

<p>蕪屯汽車路这實行建設。始於去歲之春。績溪歙縣休寗。分區從事建設。績溪至歙縣。計百有餘里。路基均已完竣。歙縣至屯溪計五十里。亦已完竣路基。後因鮑剛潰兵。竄擾皖南。又因經費無着。以致未能通車。但屯溪至休寗城一叚。計三十里。業於上月通車。營業甚爲發達。每日來往各四班。頗稱便利。頃聞自屯溪東下至草市一叚。計十五華里。亦不日可以通車。將見益形便利云云。查屯溪爲皖南重鎭。舊徵屬六邑之中樞。商務之盛。不亞於蕪湖。客歲經股匪朱老五之蹂躪。全鎭悉成灰土。據屯溪善後委員會之調查。謂損失無慮二三千萬云云。顧自遭災之後。次第建設。不謂須百年之後。主克恢復。而於最近期間。已能蔚然可觀矣。爰將屯休汽車路沿途之古蹟名勝。略記如次。（一）距屯溪五里許。由休到屯之第一站也。其地曰隆阜。爲淸乾隆時代佐修四庫全書戴東原氏之闕里。戴東原讀書處。訖今猶存故址。前幾睥上海黃軔之考察各省敎育。曾詣隆阜。題「戴東原讀書處」六字於故址之門楣上。極爲雋秀。其對岸有桃李園。廣可千餘畝。出產桃李。年値數十萬元。（一）距屯溪十五里許。有鎭曰潛阜。淸代經學家施虹玉先生曾在此地講學。其對岸爲崖山。靑叢滿山。游客蒞止。頗有心曠神移之槪。（一）距屯溪二十里許。有萬歲山。以其懸崖大河上。又名古城岩。山上骨石嶙峋。相傳爲朱太祖避難處。以故訖今尙有「萬歲山」三字碑。巍然存在臨倚大河之懸崖。一稱練心石。相傳明末金正希先生每晨蒞止。足嘗三分出外。籍以練心。說者謂金正希不屈於淸軍。多得力於斯。崖下亭台閣榭。備極玲瓏。民十以來。闢爲公園。啜茗其間者。不絶如縷。岩之東。有大石橋。長可百十餘丈。休屯路之第四站。即設於此。（一）距休城東門外五里。即距屯二十五里。有鎭曰萬安。爲休屯路之第五站。其北爲新棠村。有白菓廳。廳之一椽一柱。均由白菓樹製。現在之安徽第二中學。即就該廳而擴充建設者也。是鎭出產羅針。爲全國之冠。故業羅針者。殆居百分之五六十耳。</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e9">Japan Reforms Educational System <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese educational system will change from vertical to horizontal. In other words, it will change from a profound and in-depth system to a practical system. The vertical educational system begins with the shallow and simple, which are merely preparations for the profound and in-depth. If students cannot complete their education and stop midway, although it may not be useless, its practicality is limited. If it is a horizontal system, each grade can form its own segment, and what is learned can be applied in practice. People today prioritize application, which is why there is a proposal for a major reform of the Japanese educational system.</p>
<p>The evolution of everything in the world always begins with natural development based on the needs of the times and the extent of its power. Next, it must be because individual developments cannot be uniform, and a uniform method is forcefully implemented based on ideals. Later, because the uniformity of the ideal method does not conform to practicality, much is wasted, so practicality is once again prioritized, and a way to achieve uniformity is sought within practicality. This is the order of evolution. The changes in the current educational system are also like this.</p>
<p>Some also say that any system that can be divided and combined at each stage, that can be interrupted and continued at any time, that is useful when divided and more powerful when combined, that does not waste when interrupted, and that is more effective when continued, is a perfect system. Its implementation will be beneficial and harmless, and this is not limited to the educational system.</p>

<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, all the representatives held a meeting at the Grand Hotel. Chen and Zou had harmonious opinions and were willing to sacrifice their own principles to achieve unity and urged Yan to quickly form a government. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Beiping, 14th telegram: (1) According to a certain gentleman close to Tan Zhen, Wang Jingwei recently wrote to Tan Zhen, stating that the Western Hills faction and the Reorganization faction are competing for party orthodoxy and sticking to their own opinions. The members of the first and second sessions are now competing with each other and have different opinions, only competing for power. The so-called saving the Party and saving the country only increases disputes. This can be regarded as Wang's next footnote that he will never go north. (2) Kong Fanwei, the Shanxi representative, went to Shenyang. On the 13th, he accompanied Zhang Weiqing, the representative stationed in Shenyang, to visit Zhang Xueliang and solicit his views on the current situation. Zhang did not meet him. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e12">Declaration of the Capital Construction Committee Plenary Session <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Declaration of the First Plenary Session of the Capital Construction Committee: Since Nanjing was established as the capital of the country, it has been the center of power and its position is lofty. The need for construction is the first priority in the country. It is appropriate to have a grand scale and a solemn atmosphere, sufficient to promote national glory and restore governance, to establish a national model and demonstrate to friendly countries. This is what the people of the country wish for and what the government regards as important, not wanting to be taken lightly, but entrusting this great task to this committee to take sole responsibility. The committee is now entrusted with this important mission and should encourage progress, broadly collect opinions, and complete the major plan for the construction of the capital during the period of political tutelage, to live up to the government's entrustment and comfort the people's ardent hopes. Therefore, in June of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the National Government, the committee was organized and established. All plans are determined by previous meetings. Among the major ones, the first is to define the boundary of the capital, in order to broaden its scope, and the second is to divide the main road system, in order to distinguish between latitude and longitude, so that the design has a standard and the foundation of construction is established. Other plans have also been prepared in outline, explaining the details, and so on until now. In the middle, more than 20 meetings have been held, and the resolutions of important cases can be seen in the meeting publications. Furthermore, capital construction is complex and varied, and in order to see its early completion, it depends on the collective wisdom and efforts. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of the committee's organizational regulations, the first plenary session was held on April 15, 16, and 17 of this year. All permanent plans and construction matters for the capital are determined at this session. Now, the committee's aspirations and expectations for the people of the country will be discussed separately. The construction of the capital can be distinguished externally into two: engineering and economy. Engineering is to establish the scale of construction, and economy is to seek the development of construction. Both are progressing together, and the grand plan for the construction of the capital is thus greatly emphasized. Analyzing the two further, the engineering construction can be divided into: 1. The planning of the urban area; 2. The division of urban roads and the organization of the water system; 3. The construction of party and government organs and the management of residences; 4. The equipment of public utilities. These four are all to establish the scale of construction. The economic construction can be divided into: 1. The organization of land; 2. The revitalization of industry and commerce; 3. The improvement of forestry; 4. The promotion of cooperative enterprises. These four are all to seek the development of construction. Summarizing these matters, although they have the same trend as local construction, the capital is the focus of attention from all directions and the model for all provinces and regions. It is appropriate to have a long-term perspective and a grand plan, to establish a national model, and to make a far-reaching plan. Therefore, the committee's general principles for engineering construction are: In the planning of the capital area, we will understand the natural trends and the convenience of business, and also consider the future development trends to determine its outline. For the established system of main roads in the capital, which has been promulgated by the National Government, we will prepare specific requirements for the division of branch roads in order to facilitate the people's travel, but still with the aim of not destroying too many residences. For the construction of party and government organs, we will adopt the inherent architectural techniques of our country and carry them forward, seeking simplicity in quality without losing the atmosphere of greatness and solemnity. For the management of residences, we will rely on cleanliness, economy, and hygiene. For the equipment of public utilities, we will take what is designed and operated by the major capitals of various civilized countries in modern times and apply it to the capital to benefit the people. For the water system, we will dredge the silted rivers and lay the drains to facilitate transportation and smooth drainage. As for economic construction, we will implement the principles advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the organization of land, in order for the country and the people to benefit from each other. In the development of industry and commerce and the improvement of agriculture and forestry, Mr. Sun Yat-sen said that Nanjing has high mountains, deep waters, and plains, three kinds of natural works, all gathered in one place. When the Yangtze River Basin is long and the resources are properly developed, its future development is unlimited. The committee will follow this to study the location of resources and guide the people to use natural works in order to develop various industries, including cooperative enterprises. We will take the essence of cooperation implemented in various countries in modern times, and transmit it with national conditions, and apply it to our country so that the people of the country know what to take and obtain its benefits. These are all the directions that the committee should formulate and put into practice to comfort the people of the country. What this conference expects from the people of the whole country is the people's enthusiasm for building the capital. The capital is the capital of the people of the whole country. The success of the construction of the capital is shared, governed, and enjoyed by the people of the whole country. Therefore, at the beginning, everyone should regard it as their duty to bear the construction costs equally. At present, the national treasury is not full and people's lives are declining. The cost of building the capital is difficult to fully fund by the government and it is not appropriate to take it all from the people. The Third Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee earlier weighed the situation, understood the needs, and followed the principle of cooperation between the government and the people. For the good plan, the proposal was to estimate that the construction of the capital during the political tutelage period would require approximately 50 million yuan of national currency, with 20 million yuan divided among the provinces, depending on the province's financial strength, with varying amounts allocated. The remaining 30 million yuan will be requested from the National Government to designate customs surplus, with principal and interest guaranteed, and to issue public bonds in order to raise the full amount in the shortest possible time. This principle has been resolved and handed over to the Central Political Conference. The committee sincerely hopes that the people of the country will follow the principle of equal burden and jointly promote the completion of the capital's construction. When the period of construction implementation comes, we especially hope that the people and the government will work together, not harming the public interest for personal gain, not closing their minds to new ideas. Everything raised will be completed happily. This is what the committee expects. The committee has more expectations from the people of the whole country, that is, the importance of the construction of the capital. It is said that the deliberations of this conference have been detailed and complete, without any omissions. This is indeed difficult to achieve in reality. Moreover, the conference only lasted three days. For all important cases, only general discussions were made, and it was difficult to be meticulous. There are still many detailed methods to be prepared in the future. Although the committee has two groups for engineering and economy, responsible for planning, it still hopes that the people of the whole country, based on their true knowledge and insights, will prepare methods and state the whole story for all the construction of the capital. The committee will consider it and adopt it as much as possible. As for the committee's self-encouragement, it lies in operating with enthusiasm and without leisure. The planning must be appropriate, and the resources must be used sparingly. In the shortest possible time, we will complete this important mission, so as not to fail the government's entrustment and the high hopes of the people of the country. May our countrymen take note of this. (15th)</p>

<p>Treaty Signing Still Pending</p>
<p>Japan to Issue Statement</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 15th -- The text of the treaty currently being drafted by the treaty drafting committee was originally scheduled to be completed on the 15th and signed on the 17th. However, Italy's attitude in the committee is still very strong, stating that if the amount of holdings is not determined, Italy will have to reserve its entire attitude. Therefore, it is feared that signing will be difficult on the 17th, and the earliest will be on the 22nd.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 15th -- The general meeting for the final settlement of the disarmament conference is scheduled to be held on the 17th. Wakatsuki, the plenipotentiary, will issue a Japanese statement on the conference table that day, with two main points: (1) The newly concluded treaty is valid until December 31, 1936. (2) The participating countries should acknowledge that the provisions of the 1922 Washington Treaty have been revised in accordance with the provisions of the new treaty. In order to fully realize the effects of the new treaty, it is hoped that they will make mutual efforts.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, London, 14th -- The disarmament conference on the 14th was only held for twenty minutes and ended because the British Prime Minister and other British plenipotentiaries had to go to the Parliament to discuss the budget proposal, which kept them very busy. At the next general meeting, it was decided that negotiations between France and Italy would continue after the meeting on the 22nd, and the British Prime Minister revealed that there was no despair. The American plenipotentiary Stimson stated that the United Kingdom and the United States have acknowledged the Japanese request to convert 15% of light cruisers and destroyers into submarines.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, London, 15th -- The disarmament agreement between the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States will be signed by the plenipotentiaries of the three countries at the general meeting on the 22nd. Among the Japanese plenipotentiaries, only plenipotentiary Kazue will return home before Wakatsuki and other specialists. He plans to depart from London on the morning of the 23rd, transit through Berlin, and return home via Siberia. Wakatsuki and his party will visit various places on the mainland after signing the treaty. They have already booked cabins on the Kitano Maru from Italy. The American plenipotentiary Stimson and his party will return to the United States on the Reipia Yama the day the treaty is signed. If the signing time is slightly delayed, the ship will also be delayed to wait. There is still no progress in the negotiations between France and Italy. If there is no resolution by the 22nd, Grandi, the Italian plenipotentiary, will return to Rome. The French side, starting with Briand, will return to Paris after the general meeting on the 15th.</p>
<h3 id="e54">British House of Commons Discusses Budget Proposal <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Snowden Attends and Reports</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 14th -- Today, the House of Commons was very crowded because Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden was scheduled to present the budget proposal today. When Snowden arrived at the House, the Government Party welcomed him loudly. When he spoke on the podium, he received another round of cheers. Snowden stated that in 1929-30, there was not only no surplus of £4,096,000 as expected, but also a shortage of £14,522,000. Income tax revenue was £237,500,000, which was £2,000,000 less than budgeted, but it increased compared to previous years. Income tax is a test of national wealth, so generally speaking, the real estate industry can maintain its position. Revenue from surcharges has not expanded, and stamp duty is particularly disappointing. It was expected that stamp duty would increase by £1,000,000 compared to 1928, but due to the decline in securities transactions, it decreased by more than £5,000,000. National debt has been reduced by £31,000,000, and now still owes £7,469,000,000. The amount of floating debt has been reduced by £100,000,000 within one year, and now still owes £637,000,000, which is the lowest number since the war. He intends to amend the law regarding the budget deficit and supplement this year's debt redemption regulations by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make up for the shortage. Military spending has been reduced by more than £7,000,000 compared to three years ago, but it is still not as much as he would like. Civil spending has increased by £30,000,000 because of the implementation of the local autonomy law. The total expenditure of the current budget in 1930-31 is £781,909,000. If revenue is calculated according to the current fundraising method, it will be £739,645,000, so he must find a way to make up for the difference of £42,264,000. New taxes are unavoidable. He hopes to reduce this difference to £26,254,000 by using local taxes to relieve the hesitation funds of £16,000,000. He plans to repay £5,000,000 of the 1930 shortage this year, £5,000,000 next year, and another £4,500,000 the year after. In this way, the £14,500,000 shortage in 1929 can be gradually repaid. He intends to abolish gambling taxes, which will result in a decrease of £180,000 this year. Protective tariffs will continue to be effective before they expire, but will be abolished immediately after they expire (cheers from the Government Party, but shouts of shame from the Conservative Party). What he regrets is that the current financial situation does not allow the abolition of McKenna's protective tariffs and silk tax this year, because they can generate about £10,000,000 per year. He has also failed to fulfill his promise to abolish several existing taxes this year, but the government is very willing to abolish them all in the next four years before the expiration of the current parliament. Stamp duty will be slightly changed, and £250,000 can be collected. The license fees for motorbikes, commercial vehicles, oil-powered vehicles, and trams will also be slightly changed, resulting in a decrease of £31,714,000. The beer tax will be immediately increased by three shillings per barrel. According to brewers, beer prices and sales will not be affected by this. This tax can collect £2,750,000 this year. He will immediately prevent private companies from organizing without paying asset taxes and paying joint insurance premiums, and plans to legislate to collect income tax from those who do not reside in the United Kingdom but trade in the United Kingdom. The standard rate of income tax will increase from four shillings to four and a half shillings, but some protection will be given to those with little income, so three-quarters of income taxpayers will not be affected. All domestic industries must be estimated for industry tax. The increase in income tax in the budget this year can bring £21,000,000, and the surcharge will also be increased, which can bring £7,500,000. The asset death tax will increase from 14% to 15%, but only for assets worth more than £2,000,000. Other taxes will also be increased at the discretion of the government. It is estimated that the death tax can bring £3,000,000 this year. Including this added tax, the total revenue budget this year is £789,000,000, and a surplus of £2,236,000 can be obtained. The Chancellor of the Exchequer also stated that now is the time for practical action on land prices, but valuation is a necessary first step and will be started at the earliest possible time. He will submit another proposal on the value of real estate as a basis for taxation. If there is no unexpected disaster in 1931, there will be no need for new taxes. He has imposed additional taxes on those who are able to bear them. He has not levied direct taxes on real estate or taken anything from the very poor. He plans to find a way to agree with foreign countries so that foreign capitalists who entrust their agents to sell goods in the UK and make profits will also pay income tax. Former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Churchill said that Snowden's proposal was serious and terrible, and the House of Commons must have sufficient time to consider the nature of this case. Liberal Party leader George rose to congratulate Snowden, saying that his arguments had a shocking power on some members of the opposition party, like a six-inch shell. The House of Commons then established a budget proposal and the debate stopped.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 15th -- Snowden's first fully self-made budget proposal has made many critics lose their ability to attack because critics all expected the budget proposal to have a socialist romantic plan. The real estate industry has been stagnant recently because it does not know the meaning of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Seeing this budget proposal now, it can at least be comforting, but it is being debated whether the increased taxes will hinder commercial development. Snowden's proposal to consolidate reserves, in order to repay all national debt in fifty years, is unanimously supported by the people. The new tax has no impact on single men who earn less than £600 a year or ordinary married men who earn less than £900 a year. Therefore, the Conservative Party accused the Chancellor of the Exchequer of obvious retaliatory discrimination. Car manufacturers are still happy to enjoy the benefits of protective tariffs, but not so for the lace industry, small hardware industry, and glove industry, because their protection period will expire this year.</p>

<p>Negotiations Completed</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 14th -- Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Dalton replied to questions in the House of Commons today, saying that the temporary agreement before the conclusion of a full commercial treaty between the United Kingdom and Russia has been negotiated. It stipulates that commercial and national treatment will be based on the most-favored-nation treatment method, with certain special exceptions for shipping, and allows the Soviet Union the right to station a commercial delegation in London, including one commercial representative and two committee members sent by the Soviet embassy. These three people enjoy special diplomatic privileges (Conservative Party members shouted shame). The delegation's office is for commercial use only and also enjoys privileges, but this right does not apply to commercial lawsuits. This temporary agreement may be cancelled with six months' notice.</p>

<p>Students and Coachmen Gather to Protest</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Calcutta, 15th -- After National Congress Chairman Nehru was convicted in Allahabad yesterday, the entire city went on strike here today to show opposition. Students and coachmen are now gathering to demonstrate, blocking traffic and placing obstacles on tram tracks. Two trams have been banned from being burned. Police teams are now deployed at key points throughout the city, and armed vehicles are patrolling the streets. The situation is tense. A continued telegram says that the situation is gradually becoming serious. A crowd in the Sikh district threw stones at the firefighters who were saving the burned trams, injuring seven European officers and ten Carasi people. There was a major conflict in northern Calcutta, and nineteen people were carried into the hospital. According to unconfirmed news, there were also shootings. A European woman, driving a motorcycle into the city, was injured by stones thrown by the crowd and forced to abandon her car. The Sikh district is still very chaotic, with occasional fights, broken bricks and sticks scattered on the streets. A continued telegram says that traffic has been restored, but armed vehicles are still patrolling the streets.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, London, 15th -- Most newspapers call the demands made by Egyptian delegation chairman Nahas outrageous. British-Egyptian negotiations were still in progress at the Foreign Office at three o'clock this morning in an attempt to eliminate difficulties.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 15th -- Talks between British and Egyptian representatives began at five o'clock yesterday afternoon and did not end until four thirty this morning, with only two hours of rest for dinner, indicating the difficulty of the negotiations.

<h3 id="e58">German National Party Supports Government <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>▲ Parliament Adjourns for Half a Month</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 14th -- Today, members of the German Parliament from the National Party mostly supported the government on all important issues. When the agricultural plan was voted on, the entire party voted in favor, and the bill passed by 250 votes to 204 votes. Even on other less important issues, although members were free to advocate their own opinions, the government often obtained sufficient votes with the support of the party members, avoiding defeat. However, the difference between the number of votes for and against it was often very small. For example, the soda tax passed by only four votes, and the business tax for large department stores also passed by only six votes. The intensity of this competition of party opinions is rare in the history of the German Parliament, but there are also good results, because all members of parliament attended the meeting as a whole, even those who had taken leave to travel abroad hurried back to Berlin by plane, train, and car. Some government party members even traveled for two days and two nights to rush back to vote. Therefore, those who were not able to attend the meeting due to serious illness were rare. Now that all new taxes have been passed, Parliament has also adjourned for half a month and will reopen on May 2.</p>

Because the bank will hold a shareholders meeting in Tianjin in early May to decide on the final reorganization plan, Japanese shareholders advocated, from the standpoint of upholding vested rights, proposed that the bank recover loans to the Chinese government. It is heard that the bank still hopes for financial accommodation from the Japanese side, but this seems quite difficult.</p>

<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 15th -- The Tokyo Municipal Electric Bureau, citing financial difficulties, decided to reduce the June bonus by 10% as in the previous period. Employees, upon receiving this news, expressed their opposition and submitted six demands to Mayor Horikiri and Director Kakei. Yesterday, the Electric Bureau rejected them, and the situation became serious. The Tokyo Traffic Energy Labor Union, organized by municipal electrical workers, received a rejection response and held an emergency cadre meeting last night to discuss countermeasures. As a result, it was decided to prepare for a strike, ordering all branches to prepare a wartime organization. When the order is given, joint action can be started at any time. At the same time, a mobile headquarters will be set up to issue secret orders at any time. On the one hand, the union is raising dispute funds from its 15,000 members, one yuan per person, which started today. The Electric Bureau has also made various preparations to prevent emergencies. It urgently recruited about 600 people with driver's licenses last night. In the event of a strike, a portion of the operation will be suspended, and exchange tickets will not be issued. The system of equal distribution of five points will be used to continue operating trams. It is expected that the municipal electrical dispute will lead to a strike. In view of the previous failures, the Metropolitan Police Department will no longer undertake the labor of mediation, but will seriously deploy police at each garage to monitor the dispute groups.</p>

<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 15th -- Minister of Education Tanaka plans to carry out an unprecedented major reform of the education system after the special parliament ends and has now begun preparations. The scale is extremely large, and it is planned to abolish the current uniform formal education in order to seek the actualization of education. The current Japanese education system is longitudinal, divided into two types: general education and vocational education. All levels of education are preparatory education for promotion to higher levels. It is now planned to abolish this and fundamentally change it to a transversal system, divided into three parts: elementary, middle, and higher. Regardless of which course is completed, one can engage in social activities. The adoption of these new systems is a fundamental reform of education, so all parties are paying close attention to the Minister of Education's reform plan.</p>

We recently sent a telegram to General Commanders Han Xiangfang, Chen Xuexuan, and Ma Shaoyun, which reads: "We have read the joint telegram to Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Chiang, expressing your forthright voice and high aspirations, which is deeply gratifying. Yan and Feng are rebellious and harmful to the country, arousing universal indignation. Recently, they have even acted perversely, making them impervious to reason and impervious to kindness. The Central Government is completing unification and implementing peace. It is imperative to suppress the rebellion of these two. We brothers will don armor and wield weapons, following the great mandate, and strike directly at You and Yan. We dare to serve as a powerful force sweeping through Qin and Long, willing to be the vanguard, first forming a strategic alliance, and completing the plan of cooperation in Xuzhou. We will follow the late Premier’s instructions, engage in a final decisive battle, and sweep away the remaining feudal remnants in one fell swoop. This will be a great and joyous event in the history of the revolution." So reported, Liu Zhihan.</p>

<p>The first plenary meeting of the Capital Construction Committee was held at 2 p.m. on the 15th in the auditorium of the Lishi Society. The attending guests and committee members gathered together, making for a grand occasion. The details of the meeting are summarized below:</p>
<p>▲Morning Visit to the Mausoleum</p>
<p>▲Representatives of Committee Members from Beijing and Outside Visit the Mausoleum—At 9 a.m. on the 15th, Committee Member Liu Wendao represented by Dong Xiujia, Committee Member Ge Jingen represented by Yun Weiyou and Wu Bichi, Committee Member He Jian represented by Yuan Hui, and guest Huang Zunzhi and others, went to Zhongshan Mausoleum to pay their respects. They were received by Mr. Zhang and Mr. Huang of the Engineering Department of the Mausoleum Administration Committee. They proceeded to the memorial hall and bowed three times to Premier Sun Yat-sen's portrait, and then retreated in silent reverence. The ceremony concluded and they returned to the meeting; it was already eleven o'clock.</p>
<p>▲Afternoon Opening</p>
<p>▲Venue Arrangement—The venue was the auditorium of the Lishi Society. In the center of the stage hung the party and national flags and the portrait of the late Premier. The words "Capital Construction" were arranged at the front of the stage with pine and cypress. There was a chairman's seat, followed by the committee members' seats, then the seats for those in attendance, and further back, the guests' seats. The orchestra was upstairs, and the recording and press seats were on both sides. Charts and diagrams related to the proposals were posted on the walls on both sides, and potted flowers were arranged all around, making for an orderly and spectacular setup.</p>
<p>▲Committee Members Present—Tan Yankai, Wang Chonghui, Shao Yuanchong, Lin Sen, Wei Daoming, Xu Shiying, Hu Hanmin, Chen Guofu, Chen Shaokuan, Ma Fuxiang, Liu Jiwen, Zhang Nanxian, Kong Xiangxi, Liu Ruiheng, Chiang Kai-shek, Zhu Peide, He Yingqin (represented by Chen Yi), He Jian (represented by Yuan Hui), Lu Diping (represented by Lu Lushan), Liu Wendao (represented by Dong Xiujia), He Chengjun (represented by Tang Zhi), Zhang Qun (represented by Shen Yi), Zhang Zhijiang (represented by Wang Weifan), Wang Boqun (represented by Li Zhonggong), Chen Diaoyuan (represented by Xu Chaotong), Zhang Xueliang (represented by Qin Hua), Chen Mingshu (represented by Yang Zongjiong), Cheng Tianfang (represented by Lai Lian), Sun Ke, Song Ziwen, Yi Peiji (represented by Chen Yu), and expert Mr. McCroskey, among others.</p>
<p>▲Proceedings of the Meeting—The meeting began at 2:10 p.m., chaired by Chiang Kai-shek. After formalities, the chairman gave the opening address. Then, Hu Hanmin, representative of the Central Party Headquarters, and Wang Longhui, representative of the National Government, delivered speeches in succession. After the speeches, Liu Jiwen, Secretary-General of the General Assembly, stood up to report that a total of 25 committee members were present, with three representatives from Beijing and elsewhere, and 15 attendees. To save time, he proposed that the Chairman designate the proposal committee. Thereupon, Chairman Chiang stood up and announced that the meeting had received a large number of proposals, and it was planned to divide them into three groups for review. He then designated the members of the three groups, and the meeting adjourned with music.</p>
<p>▲Chairman's Address—Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stated in his opening address, "The National Government has established its capital in Nanjing for more than three years. Although there are plans for construction matters, the focus has been on making a start. Therefore, the government and the members of this committee hope to build it quickly. In the past two years, the government has opened roads and constructed houses in the capital, which has been criticized by those who do not understand, who believe that the government is too extravagant and disregards the suffering of the people. The government naturally does not pay attention to such baseless arguments. However, the capital is not owned by any one family, nor is it comparable to an ordinary city. It is the center of a country's politics, economy, and culture. If it is not built quickly, it will greatly affect appearances. Currently, matters such as domestic water conservancy and railways have been assigned to responsible parties, but the capital is being neglected. It is not known that if the capital cannot be perfectly constructed, other projects, even if completed, will be in vain. Taking the government's housing needs as an example, matters related to politics and diplomacy are increasing daily. If the old Governor's Office is still used as the residence, it will be impossible. Moreover, ambassadors from various countries are gathering in the capital, which is detrimental to appearances. Therefore, we must strive for construction. Secondly, the problem of tap water has not been realized even after three years of establishing the capital, which is also a major regret. Based on the above situation, I deeply feel that to build the country, we must first build the capital. Nanjing is the place most valued by the late Premier, not only for its beautiful mountains and rivers, but also for its high mountains and plains, making it the most important area in politics, economy, and culture. I hope that this committee will devote its full attention to the construction of the capital, and pay particular attention to its realization."</p>
<p>▲Proposal Review Committee—The first group is responsible for the planning of capital transportation, water conservancy, and ports, as well as the construction of all large-scale engineering projects.

<h3 id="e70">65th Meeting of the Executive Yuan <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The 65th meeting of the Executive Yuan was held on the 15th. The attendees were Tan Yankai, Song Ziwen, Wang Zhengting, Yi Peiji, Liu Ruiheng, Jiang Menglin, Sun Ke, and Kong Xiangxi. The meeting was chaired by Tan Yankai. The items discussed were as follows: (1) Nanjing Special Municipal Government reported on the increase in grain prices in the capital and the case of Wuhu, Anhui Province, prohibiting rice sales. It was resolved to prohibit the prohibition of rice sales and to approve further orders and subsidies for price stabilization. The four departments of finance, agriculture, mining, and industry will jointly discuss the plan and form a temporary agency to handle it effectively. This meeting will be convened by the Ministry of Finance, and the Yuan will send a letter to the Food Committee for reference. (2) The Ministry of Health reported that Chinese medicine has a history of thousands of years, and the formulas and legacies are often effective. However, because the drugs used have not been scientifically studied, their elements cannot be explored and their effectiveness cannot be expanded. In recent years, foreigners have devoted themselves to this, often taking it as a method to produce new drugs and import them into our country, resulting in a large outflow of profits. It is a pity. The Ministry has now gathered institutions such as the National Central Research Institute to jointly establish the Chinese Drug Research Institute and requested a monthly subsidy of 1,000 yuan to facilitate the process. The resolution was approved. (3) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on the continued allocation of 50,000 yuan in national currency to assist overseas Chinese returning from Russia. The resolution was approved. (4) The Ministry of Military Affairs reported on the compilation of aviation school regulations, educational outlines, and attached factory staffing tables, and requested that they be submitted to the government for promulgation. The resolution was transferred to the government. (5) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommended Liu Naijun as the secretary of the Portuguese embassy, Li Zhao as the secretary of the Mexican embassy, Wang Zhaojun as an attaché of the British embassy, Zhang Xuannan as an attaché of the French embassy, You Jianwen as an attaché of the Danish embassy, Xi Zilong as an attaché of the Mexican embassy, Lu Zhaopeng as the consul general in Kobe, Xu Ruiyun as the consul in Yangon, Xie Zu as the vice consul in the Philippine consulate general, Tu Rudong as the vice consul in the New York consulate general, Liu Xi as the vice consul in the Yokohama consulate general, and Zhang Xiang as the attaché consul in the Sinuiju consulate. It was resolved to submit it to the government for appointment. (6) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that Lin Chengbo, the consul in Nagasaki, was transferred to serve as the consul general in Yokohama. Li Hong, the vice consul of the Australian consulate general, was transferred to serve as the vice consul of the Melbourne consulate. Jiang Cheng, the attaché consul of the Yangon consulate, was transferred to serve as the vice consul of the Busan consulate. Jiang Yixian, the attaché consul of the Javanese consulate general, was transferred to serve as the attaché consul of the Busan consulate general. It was requested to submit the respective appointments and removals to the government for approval. The resolution was to submit it to the government for appointment and removal.</p>

<p>Hankou Communication: He Yingqin, the director of the Wuhan Branch of the Military Affairs Commission, arrived in Hankou on the 13th at 2 p.m. aboard the China Merchants Bureau's Jiangtian steamboat. Those who welcomed him at the dock included He Chengjun, acting director of the Wuhan Branch; He Guoguang, chief of staff; Wang Lun, deputy chief of staff; Jiang Dingwen, commander of the 2nd Army; Wang Jinyu, commander of the 9th Army; Xu Yuanquan, commander of the 10th Army; Xia Douyin, commander of the 13th Army; Yin Zusheng, fortress commander; Huang Zhenxing, deputy director of the military station; Qian Dajun, education director of the military academy; Wu Xingya, Zhang Guanshi, and Huang Changgui, members of the provincial government; and Liu Wendao, the mayor. After the Jiangtian steamboat docked, He and his wife, Ms. Wang Wenxiang, disembarked and went to the former site of the Foreign Affairs Office to rest. The personnel who came with them included Yu Feipeng, director of the military station; Liu Jianqun, Wang Shi, Yan Kuan, and Leng Xin, counselors; Xie Boyuan, Deng Pingyan, Wu Qi, and Lin Zhiqi, secretaries; Wang Peiren, telegraph operator; Zhou Weigang, Chen Shixu, and Xie Bangqing, staff officers; Wang Wenyan, chief of the management section of the training supervision department; Li Shaoyang, former director of the management office; Xu Xilin, former director of the medical office; Chen Peng and Wan Xiuling, councilors; and thirty-seven adjutants and staff members. A company of military and special affairs transport soldiers also came along. After arriving at the office, He took a short break and then met with various dignitaries. At 4 p.m., he summoned He Chengjun, Wang Jinyu, Xu Yuanquan, Xia Douyin, Jiang Dingwen, Yin Zusheng, Yu Feipeng, Rong Zhenxing, He Guoguang, and others to consult on military affairs and discuss various plans. The meeting lasted for two hours before adjourning. A reporter recently interviewed Mr. He and had the following conversation: (Question) "Director, please tell us the purpose of your visit to Hankou this time." (Answer) "I left Wuhan less than three months ago. I thought that after the Tang rebellion was eliminated, all the elements that had been mobilized and the feudal warlords would be able to turn over a new leaf and no longer dig their own graves. Unexpectedly, Yan and Feng and the reorganized faction, the Western Hills Conference faction, and the Anfu clique have started a rebellion. In order to implement the principles of peaceful reunification, seek the realization of political tutelage and construction, and complete the national revolution as soon as possible, the Central Government has to impose sanctions. My visit to Hankou this time is to take charge of the Wuhan Branch of the Military Affairs Commission under orders and assist Commander-in-Chief He in planning the military campaign." (Question) "What is the strength of Yan and Feng's forces?" (Answer) "The combined forces of Yan and Feng and all kinds of miscellaneous troops are no less than 200,000 men. However, Yan and Feng have deep disagreements and are superficially united and internally divided. Moreover, the replenishment of food, supplies, weapons, and ammunition, as well as spiritual education and training, are far inferior to the Central Army. The Central Army exceeds the rebel army several times, and after years of training and under the command of Commander-in-Chief Chiang, the outcome has already been determined before the battle. At present, our military deployments on the Tianjin-Pukou, Longhai, and Pinghan lines, as well as in western Shandong and northern Hubei, are extremely thorough. Commander-in-Chief Chiang recently personally inspected the front lines, and the morale is even more boosted. The military future is very promising." (April 14)</p>

<h3 id="e73">Reference Materials on the Nepal Incident <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>▲Nepal was founded by a Chinese monk.</p>
<p>▲The first king was Chinese.</p>
<p>▲The people are of mixed Chinese and Indian descent.</p>
<p>▲The Gurkhas cannot represent Nepal.</p>
<p>Translated by the World News Agency from the Indian newspaper "Buddhist India": The origin of Nepal is that those who do not understand its history all say that it became a country after the Gurkhas invaded it in 1786 AD. Therefore, Nepal is the country of the Gurkhas. In fact, this is not the case. All geologists and historians who study Nepal say that during the so-called "Golden Age," Satyaynga, the present-day Nepal Basin, was a lake called Snake Lake. Its first inhabitants came from India. Seven Buddhists visited Si Huayang Pusan and other mountains in Nepal. After these seven Indian monks came, a senior monk named Manjushri Bodhisattva Manjuari came from Mount Wutai in China (translated meaning). After Manjushri came, he drained the water of Snake Lake and opened roads and managed small countries in the valley. Its territory was 14 miles wide, and it was named Manjupattana after Manjushri. This is clearly recorded in the history of Nepal, and the ancient site can still be seen in the modern urban area of ​​Nepal, called McGiput. At that time, a city named Raikabartoni was built in the center of the small country. Its ruins are still in Kashman. According to the famous history of Nepal, Manjushri also introduced fine arts, crafts, agriculture, commerce, and all civilizations from China. Regarding this section, there is the clearest evidence in history that the first king of Nepal was a Chinese prince named Darmakara Dharmasa, who was appointed by Manjushri as king according to public opinion. After the immigrants from China came, they gradually assimilated with the people who moved from India, and their blood mixed, gradually forming a mixed Indian-Chinese nation. Their social religion, customs, and culture are all a mixture of Indian and Chinese, showing distinct characteristics, and creating a new language and a new life situation. To this day, the monosyllabic characteristics of the Nepali language, the white-yellow complexion, as well as art, architecture, social conditions, and intermarriage, are all clear proofs of the integration of Chinese and Indian cultural genes. At that time, a new race, a new culture, a new country, and a new political system were gradually formed in Manjubartoni. The people of China and India were fully unified, and their cultures were fully integrated. So under the leadership of Manjushri, the people publicly elected the Chinese prince Darmakara as the first king, located in the capital Raikabartoni. Because a king ruled two nations and two cultures, in accordance with the meaning of equal rights, the original country name Manjubartoni Nepal Nemapala (or Nebala) Nema means justice, pala or palita means governance or protection, so the name of Nepal is a country governed by equal rights, justice, and fairness.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Qingdao British American Tobacco Company Labor Strike Ends <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Communication: The current labor strike at the British American Tobacco Company in Qingdao was due to the workers' demands for wage increases and job retention, which did not yield satisfactory results. Therefore, they followed the guidance of the company's workers' consolidation committee and continued the strike. The municipal government, however, believed that it had reached an agreement with the British company to resume work on the fourth day, but the workers resisted the order, causing the municipal government to lose credibility with foreigners, which was inappropriate. Therefore, nine representatives were arrested and punished. On the one hand, the municipal party headquarters disbanded the two workers' consolidation committees of the British American Tobacco Company's printing and cigarette making, to prevent them from being used by reactionary elements. On the other hand, it persuaded the workers to resume work as soon as possible. On the 11th, the organizing committees of various political-level trade unions believed that the labor strike at the British American Tobacco Company had been prolonged and was taking extreme directions, which was not a blessing for the local area. Therefore, a joint meeting was held at the municipal party headquarters to jointly guarantee to the municipal government that work could be resumed after the arrested representatives were released, and that there would be no further out-of-bounds actions after the resumption of work. On the 12th, the municipal government and the municipal party headquarters again strictly ordered all workers to resume work as soon as possible. Recognizing the unfavorable environment, more than 1,300 workers had already returned to work on the same day. Those who had not yet returned to work were expected to return to work on the 14th. All conditions would be discussed later. As for the nine arrested representatives, Mayor Ge advocated for strict punishment. Wu Rencang, a member of the municipal party headquarters, is currently mediating the situation and may be released soon. A turbulent labor strike has thus come to an end. (13th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Taihu Bandits Mostly Dispersed <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>▲Hunan Gang Flees to Zhejiang</p>
<p>▲Linghu Ferry Seized by Bandits</p>
<p>Suzhou Communication: After the bandit Zhang Zhaohua and the Tai Bao A Shu gangs in Taihu Lake were defeated by the bandit suppression army and police forces, it has been learned that the Tai Bao A Shu gang has indeed disbanded and fled in different directions. As for the Zhang Zhaohua gang, after three fierce encirclements and suppressions by the bandit suppression army and police forces, only a hundred or so bandits remain. Yesterday, according to intelligence, twenty or thirty of them fled to Caohe Ganlu Dangkou and other places on the border of Suzhou and Wuxi. Dozens more fled to the Weiting Kunshan area on the 13th. The previous day (the 13th), Xu Boying, captain of the 11th Water Public Security Team, again supervised the patrol boats to Chengcun Lianhua Duo and other places to search for remnants, but found nothing. It was also heard that the county police team stationed in Chengcun went to investigate after the 11th Water Public Security Team exchanged fire with the bandits at Weijing Tang Louzitou, and recovered a machine gun, five or six Mauser pistols, and many rifles abandoned by the bandits on the lake shore, which have been reported to the county government. In addition, after the military and bandits exchanged fire at Chenmu Sanyuan Dam, two rifles and 252 bullets were subsequently recovered and reported to the county for record.</p>
<p>The Zheng Gang, a large gang from Henan, which was staying in Taihu Lake, had a total of fifty or sixty bandit ships. It was heard that the bandits in the Yangcheng Lake area had been dispersed by the military and police, and they were terrified. They have already fled to Zhejiang. At 3 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 13th), the Linghu ferry Dehe of the China Merchants Bureau was sailing through the Shiwai area south of the Sitingzi Port in Zhejiang, when it was seized by the bandits, who took away more than a dozen crew members and passengers, both male and female. Their whereabouts are unknown. The company has reported to Hang Yi, the deputy commander of the Eastern District of the Taihu Bandit Suppression, requesting pursuit and rescue of the hostages.</p>
<p>Li Kunyu, the battalion commander of the 1st Battalion of the 28th Regiment of the Kunshan Bandit Suppression Army, fought fiercely with the bandits at the lotus Duo (i.e., Lianhua Duo) in Yangcheng Lake on the 12th, killing six or seventy bandits (the bandits' bodies have not yet been collected), and captured eight bandits, including Shen Jinshan. The captured bandits were briefly interrogated by Commander-in-Chief Hu in Suzhou on the afternoon of the 14th and then sent to prison for further investigation. The text of the report from the 28th Regiment Commander Yao Chun to the Bandit Suppression Headquarters is transcribed as follows: "Since this regiment was ordered by His Excellency to be incorporated into the Bandit Suppression on the 1st of this month, I immediately ordered the 1st Battalion of this regiment to advance to Bacheng and other places to suppress the bandits as the opportunity arose. According to the report of the battalion commander, this regiment has been ordered to be incorporated into the Bandit Suppression since the 1st of this month, and has been searching the Yangcheng Lake and Dianshan Lake areas. Finally, at 8 a.m. on the 12th, a civilian reported that about a hundred bandits were mooring twelve boats in the Jin-Li Port of Lotus Duo in Xihai Village. After receiving the report, I led the 2nd and 3rd companies and the machine gun platoon to suppress them in three routes. Chen Shiying, the commander of the 2nd Company, led two platoons of soldiers, attached to a machine gun, landed on the north bank of Xiyang Village via Shishi Jing, and used the machine gun to attack the left side of the bandits. Tan Ronglin, the commander of the 3rd Company, led two platoons of soldiers, landed on the south end of Lianhua Duo via Lijia Gu. I led a machine gun and one platoon each from the 2nd and 3rd companies, and attacked the right side of the bandits via Xiba Gate Huangliting. At 11 a.m. on this day (the 12th), we made contact with the bandits at Jin-Li Port. The bandits were defeated and fled to Xiaxiong Tian. I then ordered the 3rd Company to quickly intercept the retreat route of the bandits towards Xiaxiong Tian and implement an encirclement. The street fighting continued until 3 p.m., when the bandits were completely wiped out, and twelve bandit ships, thirty rifles, seven Mauser pistols, two Browning rifles, and a roster were seized. Eight bandits, including Shen Jinshan, Xu Zhenqing, Wang Zhaotai, Qian Wenyuan, Wang Peng, Zhang Xiaoma, Jiang Fangqin, and Xu Zonggui, were captured alive, and thirty-one male and female hostages were rescued. Sixty or seventy bandits were killed, and the remaining bandits drowned in the water. This battle consumed a lot of bullets. I am now sending the bandit prisoners, hostages, and seized items to your headquarters for your inspection."</p>

<p>Please Discuss Early Implementation of Grain Sales: People from various districts in this county, due to the recent surge in rice prices and widespread famine, have resorted to using animal feed and grass roots as food. Although announcements about price-controlled grain sales have been repeatedly issued, implementation has been slow, with no commencement date yet. If we follow the precedents of previous years and delay until summer, it is feared that the waters of the West River will not be able to alleviate the plight of the desperate. Therefore, they have jointly requested the county to forward a request to the Righteous Granary Management Committee to expedite the commencement of sales before the registration and investigation are completed, to alleviate hunger. It is reported that the county government instructed the committee yesterday to find a way to implement this urgently.</p>

<p>Request to Order the Repair of the Canal Embankment: Dozens of Gaoyou elders, including Wang Zhongjia, are concerned that the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Office is delaying the spring repair of the canal embankment, which affects the lives and property of the lower five counties. Therefore, they jointly petitioned Chairman Ye and Director Sun of the Provincial Government's Construction Department, stating that since the beginning of spring this year, the water level in the canal has been over eight feet, and with the peach blossom flood season approaching and continuous rain expected, the water level is likely to continue to rise. If spring repairs are attempted at that time, it will be impossible to do so. If the canal embankment becomes dangerous, who will be responsible? They earnestly request the Construction Department to review past cases, consider the people's livelihood, and if the funds for this year's spring repairs have been allocated, to send personnel to thoroughly investigate. If the funds have not been allocated, they request that funds be allocated quickly to order the Canal Engineering Office to carry out spring repairs to strengthen the embankment and secure the people's livelihood.</p>

<p>Detailed Report on the Banditry at Tudai Temple: Tudai Town, under the jurisdiction of Tongxiang County, was looted by bandits on the 12th. It is now known that on the morning of that day, more than ten bandits were first sent in disguise to survey the shops and access routes. At about 2 PM in the afternoon, the bandits, wearing red symbols, landed on the east market. First, they cut off the retail telephone line of Zhao Yuanxing's oil mill and deployed sentries. Then, a gunshot was heard, and the bandits attacked, sparing no shops in the Tudai West area. The most significant losses were at the Jin Yuan Chang silver shop, the Lian Lian cloth shop, the Tailong silk shop, the Ni Fuchang rice shop, the Ye Xucheng copper shop, the Xi Yuchang sauce garden, and the Huan Changsheng paper shop, totaling more than thirty stores, with losses of approximately 20,000 yuan. The Gonghe Pawnshop was not robbed because its doors were strong. After obtaining the loot, the bandits set sail. That night, the bandit boat passed through the Beiri Hui Bridge, where it was also heard that they looted again. However, the shops in Tudai that were not looted were still not open for business because they were too frightened. The chief of the local Public Security Bureau was on leave that day, and the patrol leader and others knew that they were outnumbered, so they secretly hid their firearms and the Public Security Bureau's sign, so they were not affected. The water police stationed there, due to their responsibility, resisted the bandits, resulting in a patrol boat being sunk. Afterwards, they went to</p>

<p>Request to Implement a Fisheries and Temple Bell Tax: Zhang Daben, a citizen, believes that since the beginning of political tutelage, superstition has not yet been eliminated, which hinders the spirit of self-government. Therefore, he drafted regulations and petitioned the county government to implement a fisheries and temple bell tax, requiring those monasteries and temples with fisheries to pay taxes according to three different rates (five yuan, three yuan, and one yuan), and the people to make donations. It is estimated that the entire Shaoxing area can collect 600 yuan per month. The method is to start with compiling a register and, in addition to paying taxes according to the different rates, each person will be charged a registration fee of one jiao.</p>

<p>Education Must Emphasize Local Needs</p>
<p>Political Unity Requires Ideological Unity</p>
<p>Esteemed sirs, esteemed representatives, today marks the opening of the Second National Education Conference. We are deeply honored by the presence of representatives from various provinces and expert guests. This conference differs from the first in two key aspects, which I would like to report. (1) Each province has representatives from county and city education bureaus, with the aim of addressing and resolving various local issues. (2) This time, proposals are not submitted by local representatives but are predetermined and assessed by the central government based on current and future needs, and then compiled into a plan. Previous proposals were too broad in scope and difficult to implement, like an encyclopedia of education, leaving one unsure where to begin reading. We hope that this plan can be implemented over the next twenty years. Therefore, what we are presenting this time is of utmost importance, and its success depends on the development of domestic industry and commerce. Once the plan is approved by the central government, we hope that various localities will adapt it to their specific circumstances and strive for progress. Only through the joint efforts of the national education community can we achieve success.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a great deal of independence within the education sector. (1) There is a tendency towards disorganization, lacking a central pillar of support. In the future, we should adopt a consistent spirit to reform education. (2) Recently, schools and society have failed to communicate, making it difficult for graduates to adapt to the needs of society. This shortcoming is due to education neglecting social conditions. Therefore, despite the expansion of schools, the practical effect is not visible. Recently, some have said that there is no source of economic revenue, and no source of talent. China's education sector seems to be facing this situation. Therefore, we hope that in the future, schools will focus on the needs of the whole society. (3) Lately, those running education have views that are too inconsistent, differing based on the subjects studied or the positions held. As a result, they cannot view national education from a national perspective. In the future, it is imperative that we view national education from a national perspective. (4) Developed countries have comprehensive educational facilities. Rome was not built in a day. Our country should not simply imitate foreign countries step by step. We must determine steps that are suitable for our country to ensure their applicability.</p>
<p>Therefore, this plan aims to remedy these shortcomings, establish a common standard and proceed in an orderly manner. However, education relies on political stability. Therefore, on the one hand, we should create a center of governance so that the people of the whole country can focus their will and unify their spirit. On the other hand, we should create an academic center so that the thoughts of young people are unified, preventing them from being led astray. From this perspective, we should have a unified governance and a unified ideology, so that we can be like the North Star, around which all the stars revolve, as the ancient saying goes. Finally, we must remember Premier Sun Yat-Sen's last instruction: "Peace, struggle, save China."</p>

<p>Hope for Systematic Methods</p>
<p>May All Localities Comply and Implement</p>
<p>Today marks the beginning of the Second National Education Conference. Although the resolutions of the First National Education Conference were numerous and detailed, they were difficult to implement. Therefore, this Second National Education Conference will begin with a plan predetermined by the central government, which will be more systematic, so that everyone can come here and discuss it in detail. Currently, all parties hope to produce systematic methods so that all localities can comply and implement them. If we can do this effectively, there is hope for the future.</p>

<p>Advocate Paying Attention to Literacy</p>
<p>The inadequacy of Chinese education is due to the failure of the older generation to implement proper measures. As one of the old guard, and about to become a historical figure, I dare to make a humble request to scholars across the nation. The request is a small matter. Let me briefly explain it to you all. China cannot compete with other countries because of insufficient knowledge. However, I believe it is due to a lack of method. With a method, one can seek knowledge. For example, the theory of relativity, as long as there is a method to understand it, then even the theory of relativity can be understood. In the current discussion, (at this time, Mr. Wu took out a distribution chart indicating the proportion of literate and illiterate people) there is a question about adult literacy education. Recalling one day, a Japanese person said to me, "Recently, the number of literate people in China is only 35 percent. The number of literate people in Japan is 95 percent." A few days ago, Mr. Liu Zhan'en attended the World Education Conference, and foreigners asked him about the number of literate people in China. Mr. Liu replied that it was 20 percent. I believe that these illiterate people can also live in society, but ultimately they cannot control their environment as well as literate people. If we want to promote things, teaching people to read can start with phonetic symbols. Phonetic symbols had two major shortcomings in the past: (1) From the time of their promotion, the government did not first understand phonetic symbols themselves, so promoting them among the people was not very effective. (2) Everyone regarded phonetic symbols as characters. Today, when we promote phonetic symbols, they are only annotations beside Chinese characters so that illiterate people can recognize Chinese characters after learning phonetic symbols. For example, the phrase "not recognizing characters is very difficult." Everyone should quickly think of a method to recognize characters. Annotate words like this with phonetic symbols, and post them near train stations as a substitute for slogans. This will allow those who already know phonetic symbols to recognize the characters. Recently, many people feel a headache when they see phonetic symbols, or they may think so in their hearts even if they do not say it out loud. In fact, alphabets were invented before the Zhou Dynasty. The Phoenicians had alphabetic characters. For example, (1) the character for "one" evolved from the shape of an owl and became pronounced as "aleph". (2) The character for "two" evolved from the shape of a heron and became pronounced as "beth". After Phoenician characters entered Greece, they became today's English letters. After entering Hebrew, they became today's Hebrew alphabet. Today, Turkey is reforming its writing system and is changing the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Phonetic symbols are not characters themselves but are used for phonetic transcription. If phonetic symbols were characters, then Russia also has an alphabet, so why are 75 percent of the people still illiterate? This shows that characters are a tool for seeking knowledge, not that phonetic symbols can have their effect. Phonetic symbols only help with literacy. Characters and phonetic transcription are two different things. Our country already has characters today, but it lacks a phonetic transcription system. Today, when we teach illiterate people characters, if we teach them 2,000 characters, 1,000 characters, or 600 characters, they will ultimately not be able to apply them. If we teach them phonetic transcription, then they can pronounce and recognize any character they see in the future. Japan has a literacy rate of 95 percent. I think this is the number of people who know the alphabet. If it is the number of people who know Chinese characters, then I dare say it is only 35 percent. When we compare ourselves to them, we find that the number of people who know the alphabet is not as high as in their country. When Japan interacted with our country, they would often write things like "The emperor of the land where the sun rises" changed to "The emperor of the land where the sun sets." This shows that they had learned our writing. Japan used Chinese characters to create katakana and hiragana, adopting our country's methods of "pronounced like 'a'" and "pronounced like 'pei'" for pronunciation. Japan does not value our country, but it does not abandon Chinese characters. This shows that characters cannot be hastily abandoned. In the future, when we promote phonetic symbols, we should also annotate Chinese characters with letters so that those who do not know Chinese characters can also read. However, when promoting it, it must start with you all, gentlemen. It only takes a little time to recognize. The function of phonetic symbols has two purposes: first, to unify language. The four characters "Da Xue Zhi Dao" (The Great Learning) can be read in the same way by people from Guangdong, Sichuan, Shanghai, and Beiping. Second, it is convenient for women. These phonetic symbols are nothing short of teachers for all classes of society, and they can provide the tool of literacy to the illiterate throughout the country.</p>

<h3 id="e103">▲Hope School Education Can Be Practical <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Kong Yongzhi gave a speech, "I participated in the Capital Construction Committee meeting, so after that meeting, I came here to attend. Minister Jiang firmly urged me to speak. Since this opportunity is rare and talents are gathered, I would like to share my views with you all. Universal education is an important goal today. I believe that education must be practical. In recent years, Chinese education has been full of empty talk and lacks practicality. China's industry is lagging behind others. Looking at imported goods, regardless of cars, trains, foreign cloth, or foreign paper, they all come from foreign countries. Other things like Sunkist oranges and Washington apples also flood the markets. Looking at exported goods, China only accounts for 14 percent of the silk exported to the United States, while Japan accounts for 85 percent. This situation is very dangerous. The way to change this is to make school education practical. Therefore, one way to save the country today is to seek the universality of education, and especially to seek the applicability of education. American school education has a method of reading for two weeks and experimenting for two weeks. I hope that China can also emulate it today. In the future, China's implementation of education must focus on increasing production. The colleagues of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce are very willing to accept your valuable opinions."</p>

<p>Cheng Tianfang, the director of the Anhui Education Bureau, has been in charge of education in Anhui for more than a year. During this year, he has actively and tirelessly carried out the rectification and expansion of education in the province, such as increasing education funding, implementing inspections and guidance, reforming editing and publishing, expanding the number of schools and organizing their content, holding various meetings and various examinations, promoting physical education and the Boy Scouts, and promoting social education and county compulsory education. During the past year, there have been considerable achievements in all of these areas. Now, Mr. Cheng wants to publish the progress of Anhui education over the past year openly to society, so that those in the country who care about education can understand the situation of Anhui education and offer criticism. He ordered the various departments and sections under his jurisdiction to collect materials in February of this year, and the translation and compilation office compiled them into a volume entitled "Anhui Education in the Past Year". The entire book is divided into two parts: Part A is the department's work section, describing the department's work progress in the past year, the revision of laws and regulations, the planning of education funding, the liquidation of school property, personnel appointments and removals, inspection and guidance, the rectification of academic style, the expansion of provincial education, academic culture, physical education, various meetings, and various examinations. Part B is the section on the general situation of education, describing the general situation of education in the province in the past year and the general situation of local education. The general situation of education in the province is further divided into higher education, secondary education, primary education, and social education. The book has now been published and is approximately one thousand several hundred pages long, a thick volume bound in hardcover. It can be called a monumental work among the publications of domestic education administrative agencies. With the opening of the National Education Conference approaching, it is heard that the department has specially prepared one hundred copies for distribution to the members attending the meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Interview with Huang Dujie, Director of the Xiangtan County Education Bureau <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>(1) Source of Funds</p>
<p>(2) Promote Schools</p>
<p>(3) Unify Textbooks</p>
<p>(4) Make Finances Public</p>
<p>Director of the Xiangtan County Education Bureau, Jin Dujie, spoke with reporters yesterday. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>(1) Question: What is the amount and source of education funding?</p>
<p>Answer: The county's education funding for the 18th year of the Republic is 160,000 yuan. The sources are approximately as follows: A. Land rent is approximately 13,000 piculs of grain per year (each picul of grain is worth approximately 5 yuan). B. Land tax special donation is approximately 36,000 yuan per year. C. Deed tax surcharge is approximately 20,000 yuan per year. D. Tobacco and alcohol surtax is approximately 3,000 yuan per year. E. Pig tax and house tax are approximately 4,000 yuan per year. District education funding for the 18th year of the Republic is 220,000 yuan. In addition to donations from ancestral halls and temples, it is subsidized by county funds. Large districts receive more than 2,000 yuan, and small districts receive more than 1,000 yuan. The rest is various miscellaneous donations.</p>
<p>(2) Question: What about secondary education?</p>
<p>Answer: The county has two junior high schools, one for boys and one for girls. The boys' school has three grades, and the girls' school has two grades (there is no third grade yet). Previously, they were co-educational, but now they have been changed to separate schools for boys and girls. Even the provincial middle school has been changed to separate schools for boys and girls. The annual funding for each grade of junior high school is 1,600 yuan. Vocational schools are biased towards women. There are more than 40 such schools in the county (two private schools, and the rest are district-run). Each school is at a level between primary and secondary schools and specializes in receiving graduates of senior primary schools and those with equivalent academic ability. In addition to general subjects, there are sewing, embroidery, dyeing, and weaving. The students are very developed and cannot be accommodated. Graduates are mostly able to make a living on their own, and they are highly trusted by society.</p>
<p>(3) Question: What about primary education?</p>
<p>Answer: There are five county-run senior primary schools, distributed in cities and four townships, and three junior primary schools, one in the city and two in the townships. There is one kindergarten. There are two district-run senior primary schools and one thousand and thirty junior primary schools. There are more than ten private complete primary schools, two of which are well-managed by private individuals, so they receive provincial funding, in addition to one junior primary school established by the Junzu or Guild Hall.</p>
<p>(4) Question: What about social education?</p>
<p>Answer: The county has one library (with a reading room, a newspaper reading room, and a lecture hall), one public sports field, and reading rooms in each district, with the county responsible for a portion of the funding. There is also a circulating library system, with the districts responsible for the books and the county subsidizing a portion. Last year, there were one hundred people's schools, and this year the number has increased to two hundred. The county has a People's Education Committee to plan and promote people's education.</p>
<p>(5) Question: What is the salary of primary and secondary school teachers?</p>
<p>Answer: Secondary school teachers are paid by the hour, one yuan per hour. County-run senior primary school teachers receive a uniform monthly salary of 30 yuan, and junior primary school teachers receive 20 yuan. The salaries of district-run senior and junior primary schools are inconsistent, ranging from more than 20 yuan to as little as 10 yuan. Private schools and county schools are similar.</p>
<p>(6) Question: How are primary school teachers selected?</p>
<p>Answer: Primary school teachers have been tested twice, and only 5 or 6 percent are unqualified. Graduates of middle schools account for approximately 20 percent, graduates of A-level normal schools and the Second Normal School account for approximately 40 to 50 percent, and those who have passed the testing account for approximately 30 percent.</p>
<p>(7) Question: What are the characteristics of Xiangtan education?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Finances are practical and public. The county school accountant is appointed by the bureau, and the faculty and staff are responsible for supervision and review. After the review, it is reported to the Education Bureau and then submitted to the county political meeting for review. The bureau's finances are submitted to the county political meeting and reported to the Education Commissioner for review. (2) The Education Bureau has set up a service station for educational supplies and books, and has signed contracts with the Commercial Press, China Book Company, and World Book Company to sell various books without aiming for profit, but charging a handling fee. Under these circumstances, the textbooks used by all schools in the county are unified. (3) The county has a population of 1.1 million, with 100,000 school-age children, of which approximately 40,000 are enrolled. Currently, eight methods for improving private schools have been established to improve private schools to assist public schools. The main points of these eight methods, which have been approved by the Education Department, are as follows: A. Examination. B. Issuance of certificates after admission. C. Numbering by the Education Committee and distribution of school locations. D. Prohibition of those who do not take the examination. E. Prescribed curriculum. F. Issuance of a report card for visiting nearby schools, limited to two visits per month. G. Subject to the guidance of district and county supervisors. Those who receive three excellent evaluations will be used as substitute primary schools. H. Teachers must attend the Summer and Winter Vacation Teacher Research Institute.</p>

<p>This time, the Ministry of Education, in accordance with the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee last year, convened a national education conference in the capital. Although the current situation is not very peaceful, representatives from various provinces and regions have reported on time, indicating that there is indeed national unity in education, which is a gratifying phenomenon. I once attended the first national education conference convened by the University Council seventeen years ago, and this time I am also a member, so I feel that this conference is different from the previous conference in many ways. In summary, it seems that this national education conference has three special advantages:</p>
<p>(1) Before the first national education conference, a lot of proposals were collected from all parties. No matter what the problem was, as long as someone made a proposal, once it was reviewed and passed, it would be used as the basis for the conference's discussion.</p>

<p>This method certainly has the advantage of gathering wisdom, but it is also inevitable that there are many complex opinions and a lack of systematic discussion. This conference is not like that. The scope of discussion is limited to the plan prepared by the Education Program Compilation Committee. This plan was compiled by the Ministry of Education, gathering many specialized scholars, and after very precise research. It is not only based on the current real situation and focuses on application, but also forms a complete system. During the meeting, he gradually used it as the basis for common discussion, step by step, in an orderly manner, which can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>(2) According to the regulations of this conference, each province may designate one director of the municipal and county education bureau or one chief of the municipal and county education section to attend the meeting. At the first national education conference, each province only had the director of the education department and one education expert outside the department eligible to attend. Comparing the two, I feel that this method is indeed better, because in addition to the director of the education department in each province, adding one director or chief of the municipal and county education bureau can clarify the actual situation of local education in various provinces and regions. During the meeting, we can also think about the implementation aspects everywhere, so as not to be isolated and commit the disadvantages of emptiness or pedantry.</p>
<p>(3) Although the first national education conference passed several proposals on overseas Chinese education, it did not pay much attention to it. As for Mongolian and Tibetan education, it was regarded as beyond the pale, and no one cared about it. This conference is very different. Regarding overseas Chinese and Mongolian and Tibetan education, six experts were specially hired to attend the meeting. In the plan prepared by the Education Program Compilation Committee, a plan for improving and developing overseas Chinese education and a plan for implementing Mongolian and Tibetan education were specially added as the basis for discussion during the meeting. In addition, two groups for overseas Chinese education and Mongolian and Tibetan education were added to the review committee. The above measures are sufficient to show that the second national education conference attaches importance to overseas Chinese and Mongolian and Tibetan education.</p>
<p>Based on the above advantages, we speculate that the results obtained at this conference will be more excellent than the achievements of the previous conference. We hope that after this conference, national education can be effectively improved, and the psychological construction we long for can be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e132">The Process and Key Points of Compiling the Plan for Improving and Developing Overseas Chinese Education <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Wu Yan Yin</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education's Education Program Compilation Committee originally had an "Overseas Chinese Education Group." When it was in progress, the Training Department of the Central Party Headquarters convened a conference on overseas Chinese education and resolved everything. The director of the group stated that since there were resolutions from the conference on overseas Chinese education, there was no need to compile a plan on overseas Chinese education. Later, the members of the group, except for a few who gave opinions, did not turn in the plan.</p>
<p>After the Central Overseas Chinese Education Conference, the entire resolution of the conference was sent to the Ministry of Education. The committee felt that the entire case not only had a different format from the program's format, but also the content was not very complete. Therefore, the standing committee members re-elected personnel to draft it. After the draft was completed, it was revised several times before it became the current plan.</p>
<p>This plan incorporates all the resolutions of the Central Overseas Chinese Education Conference. At that time, a question arose, that is, "Since the resolution of the Overseas Chinese Education Conference has been decided by the Central Executive Committee and handed over for implementation, the government should follow it. Why should it be included in the plan and submitted to the National Education Conference?" The answer to this question is that this program is complete. All the resolutions of the Central Committee that have not been implemented have been included one by one. Of course, the resolution of the Overseas Chinese Education Conference is no exception. Moreover, in this plan, all the conclusions agreed upon by the Overseas Chinese Education Conference have been added with symbols before and after to indicate that they are not easy to change.</p>
<p>As for the key points of this plan, the editorial section of the National Education Conference Preparatory Committee has also put them forward separately, so I don't need to say more. But there are a few points to explain:</p>
<p>(1) There are differences in wording between this plan and the resolution of the Overseas Chinese Education Conference, and there are also omissions or supplements in terms of content. The modification of the wording is unavoidable and also has a basis. The original case was written in classical Chinese, and the program is all written in vernacular Chinese. This is the reason why the writing style has to be changed. Furthermore, the Overseas Chinese Education Conference repeatedly stated during the meeting that if there were any improper wording, it should be reorganized after the meeting, but what was submitted to the Ministry of Education was still the wording of the original case, and it was not seriously modified. Then, adding modifications is not aimless. Fortunately, the changes in wording are originally irrelevant to the main purpose, as long as the content does not change, even if it is changed to be more inappropriate, it does not matter. As for the content, for example, the original case regarding the consular management of overseas Chinese education matters suddenly listed the specific measures that the consulate should convene overseas Chinese groups and the education community to hold commemorative weeks alongside the abstract tasks of investigation, guidance, supervision, and promotion. It is really felt to be illogical. Therefore, the section on commemorative weeks was omitted from the plan, except for the Ministry of Education's instructions to various consuls to comply with it. Also, for example, the original case, the Overseas Chinese Education Association, was originally one of the people's organizations, but its powers included both the design and guidance of overseas Chinese education. In addition to the Overseas Chinese Education Design Committee and the education specialists of the consulates guiding overseas Chinese education, there is another design and guidance agency. The organization is redundant, and the powers are easy to confuse and conflict. Therefore, it was also omitted from the plan. There are many places in the plan where the original case has been omitted, but it does not hinder the original case itself, because the spirit and value of the original case are not in these. Also, for example, the original case did not stipulate how the 500,000 yuan and 10 million yuan of fund interest allocated by the central government each year should be used and who should distribute them. This plan supplements this, stipulating that it should be designed and distributed by the Overseas Chinese Education Design Committee. These seem to be important and should be supplemented.</p>
<p>(2) Some people think that this plan is generally good, but they say that there is too much said about school education. It should be simplified and only some important principles should be said. In fact, this section is compiled according to the format of the plan for improving elementary education. It is necessary to make practical regulations on the establishment, organization, construction equipment, discipline, curriculum and teaching materials, faculty and staff, students, and guidance system of overseas Chinese schools, because the so-called overseas Chinese education, in addition to administrative design, school education is really a very important center of gravity, and overseas Chinese schools are much inferior to domestic schools, and they urgently need to be improved. If this plan does not stipulate this part in detail, then it will lose its center of gravity. Some people say that the principles have been stipulated in the plan, and the methods can be designed by education administrators and school authorities in each province. I don't know that the principles are very general. Very general principles often make it impossible for people to implement them. For example, saying that teachers should be registered without saying how to register, and that teachers should be guaranteed without saying the main points of the guarantee, isn't this making it impossible for people to implement them? To implement the plan, it must be said more thoroughly. Although the content does not have to be too detailed, the procedures, the methods of handling, and the main points that should be paid attention to cannot be stipulated.</p>
<p>(3) Many people who study overseas Chinese education are generally satisfied with the organization section of the original plan, but they think that the center of gravity lies in the Ministry of Education establishing an overseas Chinese education department or an overseas Chinese education administrative committee, but the actual center of gravity does not lie in the overseas Chinese education department or the overseas Chinese education administrative committee, but in the consular specialists who guide overseas Chinese education (or the roving guidance specialists selected by the Ministry of Education) and the Overseas Chinese Education Association, because the Ministry of Education, the highest administrative education department of overseas Chinese education, is also responsible for the main method, and it does not matter much whether a special department or committee is established. If a special department or committee is established, but overseas consulates do not have education specialists (or do not send roving guidance specialists), and there are no education associations in various places, this is equivalent to a crab without feet. The whip is too long to reach, and what can be done? Otherwise, overseas has specialists to directly guide and education associations to help with the handling. The Ministry of Education only needs to complete it. It does not matter much if a special department or committee is not established. Overseas education specialists and local education associations are the center of gravity for directly supervising overseas Chinese education. Whether overseas Chinese education can be improved and developed depends entirely on this. This is what we should recognize.</p>
<p>In addition, we should know that education is not a simple problem. It is related to all politics. If other political constructions have no way, education can never have a way alone. This principle is particularly obvious and certain for overseas Chinese education. Overseas Chinese education should be supported by the country's political power. If the government cannot support it, the life of overseas Chinese education cannot be extended beyond ten or twenty years, not to mention improvement and development. The so-called support of the country's political power is not something that the Ministry of Education can do unilaterally. In addition to the Ministry of Education, at least two aspects of great help are needed:</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>(1) In terms of diplomacy, overseas Chinese schools, except those in the United States, are oppressed and cannot be free in the British, Dutch, Japanese, and French colonies. The Dutch, British, and French colonies impose harsh restrictions on overseas Chinese schools, such as registration, etc. This is known to everyone. Recently, the Dutch government does not allow Chinese consuls to manage overseas Chinese education. When Chinese consuls hold graduation ceremonies in overseas Chinese schools, their attendance and certificates are also warned by the Dutch government. As for not allowing schools to hold commemorative weeks and teach the Three Principles of the People, it is even more common. The Japanese government in Taiwan does not even allow the establishment of overseas Chinese schools. If you want to set up a formal school (other than private schools), you must have a Japanese as the principal and teach Japanese. How can overseas Chinese schools be maintained under these circumstances? How can they be improved and developed? Even if there are programs and plans, and they are detailed and thorough, what is the use? Therefore, if all programs and plans are to be implemented, they must first be successful in diplomacy. It is hoped that the diplomatic authorities will not think that overseas Chinese education is not their job, and they will be afraid to retreat and perfunctorily deal with this negotiation. They should automatically investigate the attitudes and methods of each colony towards overseas Chinese education, negotiate separately at any time, and pay attention to adding a section to protect overseas Chinese education when revising treaties, in order to do their best to protect overseas Chinese education.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of economy, overseas Chinese are failing in business because the government has no time to protect them, and the overseas Chinese themselves do not have large-scale organizations such as management capabilities. Recently, the overseas Chinese community in Manila, Philippines, has therefore affected education funds. Many people who originally paid additional education donations are now unwilling to pay. Therefore, each overseas Chinese school is in great panic. Chen Jiageng is also almost unable to maintain Xiamen University and Jimei School, which he runs, due to the sluggish rubber business. By analogy, it can be seen that if overseas Chinese businesses fail, overseas Chinese education will be difficult to maintain. It is still difficult to maintain, let alone improve and develop. To maintain and improve and develop overseas Chinese education, we cannot only find ways in education itself, because even if the government allocates 500,000 yuan a year and raises a fund of 10 million yuan and spends its interest, it is like a cup of water to quench a cart of firewood, and it cannot reverse the fate of overseas Chinese education. It is hoped that in addition to allocating funds to subsidize overseas Chinese schools, the government will also work hard to protect overseas Chinese merchants and maintain their businesses. The Japanese government often provides special subsidies to overseas merchants and people's businesses to help them compete with foreign righteousness. They also subsidize four to five million Japanese gold each year for the rubber industry. Therefore, their rubber industry can take away Chen Jiageng's market in China, resulting in the decline of Chen Jiageng's company. In view of this, the Chinese government should find ways to assist overseas Chinese merchants, either by giving them subsidies, or by sending industrial and commercial experts to various overseas ports to guide their business, or by reducing or exempting them from fees, property, and head taxes, or by diplomatic authorities finding ways to negotiate with foreign countries to lift all kinds of restraints on their business. Otherwise, overseas Chinese merchants will not be able to stand on their feet overseas for ten or twenty years in the future. The impact will not only be on education.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Educational Opinions (2) by Gao Junshan <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>(C) Proposal for Selecting Talented Children Nationwide to Receive Obligatory Education at All Levels (1) Reasons</p>
<p>(1) Talented children are the elite of a nation. All future construction and development projects will come from their hands. Before having the financial resources to implement universal compulsory education, if we can select talented children nationwide within a possible scope to provide obligatory education at all levels, the effort required for primary, secondary, and higher education would be minimal, but the results would be remarkable, achieving twice the result with half the effort. Moreover, the contribution of this group of outstanding individuals to society in the future, if it could be represented in monetary terms, would greatly exceed the cost of their education. Looking at it with a broader perspective, the education of talented children is not only a policy of immediate relief but also a system with lasting value.</p>
<p>(2) Democratic countries need leaders. The emergence of leaders is not based on origin but on talent and ability. If these exceptionally gifted children do not receive proper education to inspire their genius, they cannot fully express their intelligence. Some may even be tempted by bad environments and go astray. The negative aspect is the waste of talent, while the positive aspect is that their talent and ability may be used for wrongdoing. This becomes an obstacle to national security. Conversely, if we educate them in an ideal way, we can increase social effectiveness.</p>
<p>(3) A leader must have the personality of a leader. Without good education, they may become indulgent or selfish. Once they attain a high position, they will exploit it to satisfy their desires, like the warlords of the past. Selecting talented children for education is to cultivate our future ideal leaders with noble personalities.</p>
<p>(4) Talented children are not only future leaders of the masses, but some will also be future academic leaders. They are creators and inventors. Future contributions in literature and art, scientific discoveries, advancements in material civilization, and increased production will all rely on their strength.</p>
<p>(5) If we use a slightly higher standard when selecting (assuming one person out of every hundred, with an IQ above 130), the total number nationwide would not be very large. The state should be able to handle this economic burden.</p>
<p>(6) According to the results of experiments in special classes for gifted children attached to elementary and secondary schools in various places such as California and New York in the United States, the results are very significant, and the expenses do not need to be increased. Because of early graduation, expenses are sometimes reduced instead. Therefore, this kind of facility is indeed economical in education.</p>
<p>(2) Methods</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Education should hire educational experts to define the standards and principles for talent, compile testing tools, and formulate implementation procedures, as well as educational guidelines and procedures.</p>
<p>Huang Shiheng, Director of the Hunan Provincial Department of Education</p>
<p>(Photo taken by Nanjing Guanghua)</p>
<p>(2) Each province should invite several experienced educators to investigate talented children in various cities and villages based on the defined standards. Talented children within schools will naturally attract the attention of investigators, but this will only account for a small number. They should also find ways to investigate children who have not yet entered school to avoid the regret of missing gems.</p>
<p>(3) The selection procedure should use the most economical and precise method. Otherwise, the scale is so large that it will become impossible.</p>
<p>(4) The selection criteria should be high, so the number will not be too large, and the state can afford this expense.</p>
<p>(5) After selection, those who have not entered school should be ordered to enter school immediately. Those who are capable of entering middle school or university but cannot afford to do so should be allowed to attend school for free. Those from extremely poor families should also be given appropriate subsidies for books and stationery.</p>
<p>(6) Schools at all levels that talented children enter should have special facilities to give them the opportunity for free development, so they are not constrained by ordinary children.</p>
<p>(Note) Some people think that this kind of method is not in line with the spirit of equality. In reality, it is not. The saying "All men are created equal" is just a self-deception for religious figures because unequal phenomena in society are so obvious. Therefore, they have to use excuses to comfort themselves and reassure people. But where is there such a thing? The most unequal thing is the difference in innate abilities. Genius and idiocy are extremely obvious phenomena, but these phenomena are the most impossible to imagine. Since there is no way to imagine, we are happy to take this opportunity to use it. In an organized group, the position of each member cannot be without difference. Once there is a difference, classes are produced. What way is there to stop this? This kind of organized group needs different talents. The highest position cannot but be given to the highest talent. Since the emergence of talent follows the laws of nature, and society has to rely on talent, then our selection of talent and providing obligatory education at all levels is to use talent to increase social efficiency and not to enhance the class system.</p>
<p>▲ Proposals to set up special classes in primary and secondary schools</p>
<p>(1) Reasons</p>
<p>(1) The great difference between individuals has been confirmed by scientific methods. Therefore, children of the same age of nine, one is still having difficulty in the second grade, and one can already enter the sixth grade. The current school system mostly divides classes according to age and the length of enrollment, not according to ability. Moreover, the facilities in teaching are based on the ability of ordinary children. Neither the disabled nor the gifted children are taken care of. The impact of this kind of education only affects the mediocre group of people. The extremes on both sides do not receive the same benefits. This is a great waste in teaching. After the special classes are set up, this kind of waste can be eliminated.</p>
<p>(2) Compulsory education is a right that every child should enjoy, not just for mediocre children. Although disabled children, talented children, and mediocre children have the same obligation to pay taxes, everyone does not enjoy the same rights. This is mistreating the disabled and the gifted children.</p>
<p>(3) Disabled children are always lagging behind in a class, constantly running behind their classmates. No matter how hard they try, the results are inevitably failure. In addition to shame, anger, and resentment, they will inevitably become eccentric or pessimistic. Because gifted children find their schoolwork too easy, they cannot be motivated to move forward. They will inevitably develop lazy habits. Moreover, living above others and gaining without labor can also develop an arrogant heart. These are all contrary to the principle of cultivating personality. But if special classes are set up, then the disabled children will not feel ashamed of themselves compared to others and feel despair, and the gifted children can compete with those of equal ability without being depressed.</p>
<p>(4) Most of the subjects in school are textual, symbolic, and abstract. Disabled children lack the ability to understand abstract things, so textual education is often futile. If disabled children are put into special classes and taught separately, then teaching materials and methods suitable for their abilities can be used. (To be continued)</p>

<p>A total of over 300 scouts from Zhejiang, Qingdao, Shandong, and other places continued to arrive for the national scout inspection on the 15th.</p>
<p>▲ Chairman Chiang Approves Allocation of Barracks for Research Class</p>
<p>For this general inspection, it was originally planned for scouts from various places to stay at the camp in Beijing. However, due to the continuous rain in recent days, there was a lot of water in the camp, and there was no way to camp. Therefore, the reception section of the office invited them to stay in various schools and public places separately. On the 15th, the office found it inconvenient to manage and liaise with them in various places, so it contacted the National Government. Chairman Chiang approved the allocation of a part of the barracks of the military officer research class as a camp for scouts arriving in Beijing. It is said that it can accommodate three or four thousand people. The move-in began in the afternoon.</p>
<p>▲ Appointing Evaluation Committee Members</p>
<p>The organizational regulations of the National Scout Inspection Evaluation Committee have been promulgated and implemented by the Scout Headquarters. The office sent letters inviting Hu Hanmin, Dai Jitao, Sun Ke, Chen Guofu, Zheng Wu Ting, Liu Luyin, Chen Lifu, Shao Yuanchong, Jiang Menglin and other nine people to be members of the evaluation committee for the first general inspection and the grand camping event.</p>
<p>▲ Organizational Regulations of the Evaluation Committee</p>

<p>▲ Four Shanghai Scout Regiments Have Not Arrived in Beijing</p>
<p>Departure Slightly Delayed Due to Rain and Inconvenience for Camping</p>
<p>Central News Agency: The National Scout General Inspection will be held soon. Scouts from various places are arriving in Beijing one after another to prepare for participation. The Shanghai Scouts also arrived in Beijing by express train yesterday (the 15th) afternoon, including the 7th, 15th, 20th, 50th, 60th, 123rd, 129th, 121st, and 119th Regiments directly under the jurisdiction, and individuals participating as service members, totaling about 400 people. They have all reported to the headquarters one after another and stationed in various places. Due to the rain and inconvenience for camping, the 176th, 177th, 178th, and 179th Regiments, which have not yet registered, have been instructed by Zhu Jialang, a special member of the Shanghai City Party Department, to delay their departure. In addition, the Shanghai City Party Department, considering the solemn significance of this general inspection, has specially sent Zhu Jialang to participate, and brought two silver-framed souvenirs. One is to present to the best achiever of the general inspection, titled "Crown of Heroes," and the other is to present to Commander He for his supplementary oath of office, titled "Gathering Talents from All Over the World to Educate Them." They have all been handed over for forwarding. It is heard that the Shanghai Scouts plan to participate in various competitions.</p>

<p>▲ Closed and Awarded Prizes Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Depart for Beijing Today</p>
<p>The first Grand Camping of the Jiangsu All-Day Scouts, since the opening ceremony on the 13th, has been continuously rainy, so that various competitions cannot be held due to the slippery ground. Moreover, due to the urgent schedule for going to Beijing, all competitions have been cancelled. Although this time there was no competition, the spirit of each team was always shining before our eyes, which has aroused the attention and admiration of the community. They will definitely have good results in the National General Inspection in the future. At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, the closing ceremony was held and prizes, commemorative medals, and certificates were awarded. The details are recorded separately as follows.</p>
<p>▲ Closing Ceremony</p>
<p>(1) Play music; (2) Sing the Party song; (3) Pay the highest respect to the Party flag, the national flag, and the portrait of the Premier; (4) The chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will; (5) Silence; (6) The chief evaluator reports; (7) Inspection; (8) Admonition; (9) Awarding prizes; (10) Sing the Scout song; (11) Shout slogans; (12) Ceremony.</p>
<p>Circle the field three times; (13) Play music and dismiss.</p>
<p>▲ Participating Representatives</p>
<p>Chairman Ye Chu of the provincial government, Li Mingyang, member of the Hu Puan Committee, Zhang Daofan, Ye Xiufeng, Zhu Jianbai, Wu Baofeng of the provincial party headquarters, Mrs. Chen He, Ms. Zhao Lingxian, representatives of various institutions and organizations, and about 7,000 people.</p>
<p>▲ Chairman Ye Gifts Food</p>
<p>Chairman Ye of the Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that the scouts held their first grand camping during the continuous rain, and the members of each regiment never reduced their brave spirit due to the rain, which is commendable. He specially gifted 915 boxes of canned food, with each member getting one box on average, to encourage them.</p>
<p>▲ Chief Evaluator's Report</p>
<p>Chief Evaluator Zhang Daofan reported, roughly saying that today is the last day of the Grand Camping. Because of the bad weather these days, we could not compete. Today's awards are based on the standards of camping, cleanliness inside the camp, discipline in the camp, morning exercises, service spirit, and neat uniforms. This time, there are more than 100 large prizes and more than 1,000 small prizes. When distributing the prizes, we can proudly say that there is no partiality. Although there are grades in each country, everyone can get a little prize to encourage them. Our scouts take service as their duty and do not want rewards. Several regiments reported too late this time, and originally there was no reward, but this delay was mostly due to waiting for the train to buy tickets, etc., which could not be done smoothly. Waiting for the train is impossible to imagine, so everyone is rewarded. The 58th Regiment has very good results, but their qualification as instructors cannot be compared with ordinary schools and scouts, so they are evaluated separately and given separate awards without comparing them with other regiments on average. This is the evaluation committee's process of evaluation. I hope that those who get more prizes will strive for progress, and those who get fewer prizes will work harder. Tomorrow we will leave for Beijing to participate in the National General Inspection. I hope everyone will work hard to win glory for Jiangsu Scouts and set an example for national scouts.</p>
<p>▲ Ye Chucang's Admonition Fellow students, you have traveled a long way to camp here in the past few days of wind and rain, and everyone is energetic. I sincerely ask you, are you in good health during these days of work? Although the flags you have written are scouts, in another position, you are the continuers of the life of the Chinese nation. The survival and development of the nation in the future, and the independence and freedom of the country, will all be entrusted to you. Your health is not your individual health, but the health of the Chinese nation. That is why I want to represent the provincial government today to those who have come from afar and worked very hard in good health: The National Revolution has not yet succeeded, and there is still a long period of time before we can go from overthrowing the warlords to overthrowing all imperialists and building a free and equal country. I am afraid that it will take thirty or fifty years to complete the right. In the battle, the first class of active soldiers has retired, and we hope that the second class of reserve soldiers will continue to fight. After the reserve is prepared, we also hope that the third class of reserve soldiers can take over and rise up. Brothers are no longer qualified as scouts, and the cause of revolution has not been completed. Time cannot be left. We have to hope that you will have a reserve force to continue the Chinese life and come forward to advance the revolution. This is to wish health for the success of the revolution. Second, Jiangsu has always been despised for its weakness, only knowing how to write articles and only knowing how to talk nonsense. The people's physique is weakening day by day. How can we imagine the health of the entire nation? If Jiangsu has no sound physique forever, this is the lag of the revolution. This is for Jiangsu to restore the health of the weak.</p>
<p>The spirit of operating in heavy rain these days is not diminished, this kind of decisive will is very admirable. If this spirit is fulfilled, then anything that can stop me will not be moved by it, that is, when the bullets come to us, we are like raindrops, not rejected by him, what a cloud of admirable China How can you not strengthen</p>
<p>▲ Award Situation</p>
<p>After the admonition of the two provincial government members Ye and Li, the awards were presented by Zhao Jinxian, wife of the Director of Education Chen Hexian. Chen Bangcai, the director of the camp, brought them close to the front of the stage in order. Each group had a total of five regiments. For a time, the music was ocean-like, and the applause was endless. The representatives of each award-winning regiment were all overjoyed, and Mrs. Zhao Lingxian, with a smile on her face when issuing the awards, completed the awards. Then, the captains of each team distributed the canned food donated by Chairman Ye and the thousand commemorative medals from the Shandong Provincial Government.</p>
<p>▲ Grade and Prizes</p>
<p>Although this grand camping was not able to compete due to the rain, the results of the daily morning exercises, camping cleanliness, discipline, cooking, and service spirit were evaluated by the evaluation committee. The 58th regiment of Suzhou Zhongshan Sports College was the best. However, because the regiment is a training class dedicated to training scout teachers, there are special circumstances, and good results have been achieved. It cannot be treated the same as other regiments. However, because the regiment has served the camp for days and is quite commendable, the Grand Silver Cup donated by Commander-in-Chief Chiang, the Silver Shield of He Yingqin, and the Grand Award Flag of Wang Zhengting of the Ministry of Education were awarded to encourage it. This time, the evaluation procedure is divided into eight grades. Except for the 60th Regiment of Jiangdu, which is ranked in the first grade, the other grades include 357 regiments. All participants have prizes, but the number is large and the size of the silver shield. In addition to the awards received by each regiment, the evaluation meeting believed that the service personnel such as the business director of the camp director, the deputy director of the information team, the captain and deputy captain of the public security team, and the director of the hospital were able to perform their duties in the continuous heavy rain, and they should also be rewarded. The remaining award flags were given to them as a souvenir. As for the thousand commemorative medals donated by the Shandong Provincial Government, each member of the team received one. Chen Guofu, a member of the Central Executive Committee, specially donated a complete collection of Premier's works this morning, which was given to Mr. Chen Bangcai, the director of the camp, after discussion by the evaluation committee. In the future, if more prizes are received, the outstanding teams in the province will be rewarded for participating in the National General Inspection. Today, the prizes for each team will be distributed in turn by Zhao Lingxian, wife of Chen Hexian, Director of the Department of Education.</p>

<p>▲ Depart for Beijing Today</p>
<p>The Scouts of Jiangsu Province will gather at the station at 10:00 am today (16th) to charter five passenger cars. At 10:50, the Xining car will depart for Beijing after departure. The general representatives for participating in the National General Inspection are Zhang Daofan from the Provincial Party Department, Xu Guozhi for General Affairs, and Chen Bangcai for General Training. There are four groups in total. The general leaders are Zhu Chongming, Ye Yangyuan leads the Women's Group, Wang Tao leads the Kindergarten Group, and Gu Zuhua and Song Yugong lead the Chinese Group. It is planned to convene service members for a conversation meeting once a day in Beijing. It is heard that Jiangsu has the largest number of participants in this National General Inspection. Judging from the results of the daily camping, Jiangsu is expected to be among the top two.</p>
<p>▲ Bonfire Party</p>
<p>Continuous rain has prevented various competitions from being fully enjoyed. Now it is beginning to clear up and it is also announced that the closing ceremony will be held. Last night at 8:00 pm, a bonfire party was held to give a full performance.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Record of the Three Organizations Convening Talks with Principals of Private Secondary Schools and Above <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Propaganda Department, the People's Training Committee, and the Municipal Education Bureau jointly convened a meeting with principals of private secondary schools and above in this city at 2 PM the day before yesterday. Attendees included Chen Dezheng, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special Municipal Committee of the Kuomintang and Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Tong Xingbai of the People's Training Committee, and Chu Fucheng, President of the Faculty of Law University, totaling more than ten people. Chen Dezheng presided over the meeting, with Gu Zenghong serving as the recorder.</p>
<p>The meeting began as scheduled. Chairman Chen Dezheng reported, stating in brief: "Today, the Municipal Party Department Propaganda Department, the People's Training Committee, and the Education Bureau have jointly convened this meeting with principals of secondary schools and above. I will first explain the reasons for this gathering and then invite all of you to express your opinions. Before explaining the reasons, the three organizations must first apologize for the abruptness of this meeting and express our gratitude for your punctuality.</p>
<p>"Recently, numerous reactionary elements, such as Communists, Nationalists, Reorganizationists, and disillusioned politicians, have taken advantage of the rebellions of Yan and Feng to engage in extensive activities, attempting to create social unrest to achieve their selfish goals. They are constantly seeking opportunities for reaction. The recent disturbance on Beijing Road is a clear example. You are all likely familiar with the details of this event, so I need not elaborate. In short, these are reactionary elements seeking to sacrifice the lives of others to ignite chaos. The unfortunate deceased were sacrificed, a truly tragic event. We are paying close attention to these types of incidents.</p>
<p>"We must recognize that under the current circumstances of internal and external troubles, China must achieve peaceful unification to save our nation from peril. The first step is for everyone to focus on their respective duties and fulfill their responsibilities. As this group of reactionary elements attacks the central government, we must do our utmost to assist the central government in preventing all reaction. Yesterday's disturbance on Beijing Road was merely the first act orchestrated by reactionary elements. Unfortunate events may, indeed, unfortunately recur. To prevent problems before they arise, the three organizations have convened this meeting.</p>
<p>"Reactionary elements are very effective in their propaganda. They cleverly create pretexts, such as the Free Alliance, the Humanitarian and Relief Society, and the April 8th Massacre Relief Association. Upon examination, their actions are directly or indirectly directed and incited by the Communist Party. They use appealing names to incite the public. For example, the Free Alliance targets schools. They invite seemingly famous, disillusioned scholars to give lectures at various schools, inciting young students with unsettled blood. The Party then stirs up unrest to achieve their goal of creating a society of terror.</p>
<p>"You are all educators and, of course, everyone seeks freedom. However, we must clearly understand the true meaning of freedom. What kind of freedom does the Free Alliance advocate? They use the beautiful name of individual freedom to incite the minds of young students, aiming to undermine the freedom of the nation and the people. I ask you, before the freedom of the nation and the people is secured, shouldn't individuals sacrifice a portion of their individual freedom to strive for the freedom of our nation and the people? Once the freedom of the nation and the people is destroyed, where will individual freedom come from? The Free Alliance has the Communist Party as its background. They do not want the freedom of the nation and the people. We must clearly recognize their true colors and not be deceived by their appealing names. Young students with unsettled blood are easily incited, so I ask you to pay special attention to preventing their activities to safeguard the peace of society and the nation.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, they say that the Ministry of Education and the Municipal Education Bureau are depriving young people of their freedom to study. Their reason is that the Ministry of Education has recently closed private universities. The Ministry's crackdown on private schools is entirely for the sake of young people's pursuit of happiness, preventing them from being deceived by universities established for the purpose of extorting money. I ask you, should schools have complete curricula and orderly facilities? Is it permissible to disregard everything and pursue other goals under the guise of running a school? The Ministry of Education wants young students to acquire genuine knowledge, so it is strictly cracking down on private universities, truly seeking to protect young students' education. However, the reactionaries are using this as an opportunity to create disturbances and spread many alarming rumors to incite the public. I hope you will inform your faculty and students not to fall for these unfounded rumors.</p>
<p>"The Humanitarian and Relief Society also has a good name, but their humanitarianism is to incite ignorant young people to create tragedies, and their relief is to take other people's money to fund their reactionary activities. This kind of propaganda is not likely to be effective in the knowledgeable education sector, so they focus on the worker aspect. However, we must also pay attention to preventing them. I hope you will be mindful of students' actions. Yesterday, the protesters on Beijing Road claimed to be supporting the labor unrest at Jardine Matheson in Nanjing Xiaguan. In fact, the Jardine Matheson labor unrest has been completely resolved. The central government has already published the details in the newspapers. However, reactionary elements are still using this as an excuse to create trouble, resulting in the tragic deaths of innocent young people. The reactionaries want to use the Jardine Matheson labor unrest to create a second May 30th Massacre, using other people's lives as opportunities for their activities. Their intentions are truly hateful.</p>
<p>"I heard that students from various schools participated yesterday. I ask you to strictly prohibit students from participating in these kinds of events in the future. In twenty-one days, May will arrive. There are many commemorative days in May, making it a month of many disasters. Reactionary elements will certainly take advantage of this May, with its appealing names and potential for rallying support, to engage in extensive activities. I now ask you to pay attention and cooperate with us to prevent the major conspiracies of the reactionaries. When a small number of students from your schools participate at that time, I hope you will make efforts to persuade them. The Party and the government will have ways to address all national humiliations and public welfare issues. Your schools generally have large student populations, and it is difficult to ensure that every student is reliable. You should be responsible for preventing students from acting outside the bounds. If you encounter difficulties, you can report to us at any time. You, as principals, can of course be responsible for the overall actions and expressions of the entire student body. Although reactionary elements are conspiring to create chaos, if we make efforts to prevent them, their activities will certainly be greatly hampered. The sole purpose of the three organizations convening this meeting today is to address this issue. Please pay attention."</p>
<p>Tong Xingbai of the People's Training Committee gave a speech, stating in brief: "The reasons for the three organizations convening this meeting have been explained in detail by the chairman, so I need not repeat them. The chairman has already explained the passive prevention methods. I will now say a few words about the proactive prevention methods. First, we must change our mindset. Most people in education believe that the responsibility for implementing Party ideology lies with the Party Department. This view is wrong. We must understand that education is a tool for implementing the Three People's Principles. Those running schools should share the responsibility of implementing the Three People's Principles with the Party Department. Second, we must prevent crises lurking within. Elementary school students, after being guided by teachers, can indeed feel the influence. However, the situation is different in middle schools and universities. This is because the various social science textbooks on the Three People's Principles are incomplete. Most schools use textbooks on Communism, Nationalism, and other ideologies. These anti-Three People's Principles textbooks have a significant influence. Although schools have Party ideology courses, the hours are few, and they cannot compete with the effectiveness of the anti-Three People's Principles textbooks. We acknowledge that textbooks should be carefully considered. Although textbooks on various subjects have various ideologies, we should summarize them with the Three People's Principles. Currently, we are far from this ideal. This is a crisis in Party ideology education. Teachers should use the Three People's Principles as the guiding principle to critique various theories. Then, students will naturally not be influenced by various theories and embark on the path of reaction."</p>
<p>Li Yuanshan (Tongde Obstetrics School) stated in brief: "I deeply admire the three organizations' concern for social stability and school unrest. Our school has very little connection with research on the relationship between medicine and social problems. Students also have very little contact with society. If there are any reactionary events in the future, we will make efforts to prohibit them."</p>
<p>Xia Jinlin (Melon Middle School) stated in brief: "Please provide guidance from the three organizations on the dates of school closures, class suspensions, and student participation in commemorative events."</p>
<p>Wang Daoyuan (Shanghai Art College) stated in brief: "Our school has district branches that can prevent all reactionary propaganda."</p>
<p>Qian Yimin (Huiling Middle School) stated in brief: "Our school's location is remote, and we have very little contact with society."</p>
<p>Gu Zhizhong (Minzhi Middle School) stated in brief: "The work of reactionary elements is very secretive. It is really difficult for school authorities to prevent these actions. My personal opinion is that Party members should bear more responsibility and secretly resist reactionary propaganda. It is easy for classmates to know about the actions of reactionary elements. We can ask the Party Department to instruct Party members in the student body to pay close attention to reactionary elements among their classmates."</p>
<p>Fan Peiyu (Suzhou Shanghai Middle School) stated in brief: "Our school has received reactionary publications. We should ask the Party Department to pay attention to the mailing of these reactionary publications."</p>
<p>Zhang Juansheng (Nanyang Commercial High School) stated in brief: "To prevent reaction, we should do more propaganda work. I believe the Party Department can send more people to various schools to conduct propaganda during commemorative weeks, making it easier for students to be influenced."</p>
<p>Su Yingjie (Minli Middle School) stated in brief: "There are many commemorative days in May. Disputes often arise between school authorities and students. The Education Bureau should be notified this year to avoid disputes. At the same time, the student union should also be notified."</p>
<p>Zhao Shifu (Zhonghua Vocational School) stated in brief: "The propaganda of reactionary elements is really very powerful. There are too few Party ideology courses, and there are not enough Party ideology teachers. I hope that Party ideology teachers can not only understand Party ideology but also understand various ideologies and be able to accurately critique various theories so that students are not incited by other ideologies. It seems that Sunday can be used to study Party ideology."</p>
<p>Zhu Fucheng (Faculty of Law University) stated in brief: "The schools mentioned in the chairman's report should naturally pay attention to ensuring that the eventful May passes peacefully. Inevitably, there will be a small number of reactionary elements in each school. According to the ministry's order, there will be no holidays in May. I believe that during the commemorative days in May, each school can suspend classes for one or two hours to hold commemorations so that students do not participate in off-campus commemorations. At the same time, the Party Department can send people to give speeches, which may allow May to pass peacefully."</p>
<p>The chairman stated in brief: "The Ministry of Education issued a circular on July 1st last year, stating that there will be no holidays for any commemorative days in May. For the May 1st Labor Day meeting, various agencies will send personnel to participate but will not have a holiday. For the May 3rd Party Department-organized commemoration, various agencies will send personnel to participate but will not have a holiday. For the May 4th student-organized commemoration, the Party Department will send personnel to provide guidance but will not have a holiday. For the May 5th Party Department-organized commemoration, various agencies will send personnel to participate but will not have a holiday. For the May 9th Party Department-organized delegate assembly, there will be no holiday. For the May 6th Party Department-organized commemoration, various agencies will send personnel to participate but will not have a holiday. For the May 30th Party Department-organized delegate assembly, there will be no holiday. Each school can follow the ministry's orders and will not be notified again."</p>
<p>Mr. Chu's suggestions are very good. Each school can hold commemorations on campus. Party ideology education does not end with the Three People's Principles courses. We should pay attention to discipline and facilities. Educators should use schools to civilize and make it easier for students to be influenced by the Three People's Principles. This is the true spirit of Party ideology education. I hope you will pay attention. The use of holidays can be determined by each school based on their circumstances. Regarding the issue of the insufficient number of Party ideology teachers and the difficulty in shouldering the school's finances, the Party Department and the Education Bureau will devise good policies. The sole purpose of the three organizations convening this meeting today is to prevent the conspiracies of reactionary elements and to ensure that the education in this city can progress according to plan."</p>
<h3 id="e139">Municipal Education Bureau Orders Municipal Schools' College Guidance Forms Not to Be Sent to the Bureau <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to municipal schools yesterday, stating: "The College and Career Guidance Committee of this Bureau, to assist schools in implementing college and career guidance, has created three types of forms: the Student Interest Survey Form, the College-Bound Student Survey Form, and the Career-Bound Student Survey Form. These forms have been circulated to schools for purchase from the Bureau. However, a small number of schools, after students have filled out the forms, immediately compile and send them to the Bureau. This is inconsistent with the College and Career Guidance methods. According to the methods, after the forms are filled out, they do not need to be sent to the Bureau. Schools can disassemble and summarize the forms filled out by students and implement guidance based on the results of the forms and the procedures stipulated in the methods. At the end of the semester, the schools can submit a report to the Bureau on the guidance process and results."</p>

<p>(1) Name to Be Changed</p>
<p>The Tokyo Dispatch on the 9th stated: "When the Eighth Games were held in Shanghai, Dr. Oseas of the Philippines informally suggested at the conference of the China-Japan-Philippines Committee that the name of the Games, originally called the Far Eastern Games, would be inappropriate when countries such as India participate in the future. It should be changed to the Oriental Athletic Championships." At that time, this suggestion was not approved. Therefore, it was decided to discuss it again at this Games.</p>
<p>(2) Volleyball Still Uses Old Rules</p>
<p>For the volleyball rules of this Games, Japan proposed using the current rules stipulated in Japan. However, China and the Philippines firmly expressed their opposition. As a result, the old Far Eastern rules must still be used. These rules are called the "First to Score Out" system. The court is seventy feet long and twenty-five feet wide. For women's competitions, there are twelve official players and two substitutes. The men's net is seven feet six inches high, and the women's net is six feet six inches high.</p>
<p>(3) Boxing Not Open to the Public</p>
<p>The boxing competition at this Games is limited to official athletes only and will not be open to the public. Foreigners residing in Japan are not allowed to participate.</p>
<p>(4) Japan's Baseball Team</p>
<p>For the baseball competition at this Games, the representative players from Japan will be determined by the Japan Sports Association. It has been decided to invite the six major universities of Waseda, Tokyo, Keio, Meiji, Rikkyo, and Hosei to compete at the Meiji Jingu Stadium. The winner will participate in the Games.</p>
<p>Also, the United Press Tokyo dispatch on the 15th stated: "In the second game between Keio and Meiji Universities in the Six Universities Baseball League, Meiji avenged their defeat with a score of four to two. In the second game between Waseda and Teikyo Universities, Waseda won again with a score of nine to four." Another dispatch said: "The final game between Keio and Meiji Universities, which had one win and one loss, has been temporarily postponed. The game originally scheduled for this afternoon between Hosei University and Rikkyo University has been postponed due to rain."</p>

In 1926, the Party vowed to launch the Northern Expedition and recover Wuhan. The National Government moved from Guangdong to Wuhan. On April 18th, 1927, in accordance with the Prime Minister's will, Nanjing was established as the capital. The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Kuomintang is actively preparing for the celebration, formulating propaganda outlines and commemorative methods, which have been disclosed and distributed to various lower-level Party departments.

<p>▲ The election will be held at the Chamber of Commerce at 3 PM</p>
<p>▲ Prediction of the Five Chinese Directors for This Term</p>
<p>The Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association is scheduled to elect five Chinese directors and six committee members to the Bureau of Public Works at the Chamber of Commerce at Tianhou Temple Bridge today at 3 PM. The Shanghai Special Municipal Government and the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will send personnel to supervise the election. The number of Chinese directors for this term has been increased from three to five. Although the candidates are still competing, according to reliable information obtained by our reporter, it is predicted that in today's election, the incumbent Chinese directors Yuan Ludeng, Yu Qiaqing, and Xu Xinliu are expected to be re-elected. As for the two newly added Chinese directors, they will belong to Bei Songsun and Liu Hongsheng. The original six committee members were Lin Kanghou, Qian Huazhang, Chen Tingrui, Li Fuxun, Qin Runqing, and Bei Songsun. In addition to Bei having the hope of being elected as a Chinese director, the remaining five are not expected to change. As for who will be elected for the remaining vacancy, nothing has been heard yet. Last night, the representatives of the Chinese Taxpayers held a dinner party at the Yinkong Association on Hong Kong Road, exchanged views, and finalized the results. It is roughly like this.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Bureau of Public Works Reduces Taxes <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>▲ Decision Effective July 1st</p>
<p>▲ Abolition of the Two-Percent Additional Surtax</p>
<p>▲ Land Tax Changed to Seven Per Thousand</p>
<p>The municipal surtax in the Public Concession, commonly known as the Police Surtax, was originally 14%. From July 1st, 1927, it was increased to 16%. The municipal surtax in areas outside the Concession, that is, the Extra-Settlement Roads Area, was also increased from 12% to 14%. At that time, the Chinese taxpayers believed that the surtax had not been agreed upon and rose up in opposition. As a result, more than 40 stores were forced to close. Later, Yu Qiaqing served as a mediator, and the two-percent surtax was paid under protest under the name of "Two-Percent Additional Surtax". According to news from the Bureau of Public Works, the Board of Directors of the Bureau of Public Works has decided to abolish the two-percent additional surtax and reduce the land tax from eight per thousand to seven per thousand, effective July 1st of this year. The budget for this year has also been revised accordingly.</p>

<p>▲Reported by the Fifth District Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Approximately 200 mu of embankments, ditches, and nearby civilian farmland in the Donggou area north of Gaohang District, Pudong, were illegally sold by former township councilor Ma Wenxiang and others to the Japanese company Iwata Yoko, with boundary stones erected. Local residents reported this to the Ninth and Eleventh Sub-branches of the Fifth District. These members successively took film of the boundary stones and reported the matter to the Fifth District Party Headquarters, requesting investigation. The Third District Fifth Branch of the District Public Security Bureau also summoned Ma for questioning, and a Mr. Xu testified at the station. The station chief, considering the matter concerned the illegal sale of national land, immediately reported it to the Municipal Bureau for referral to the court for investigation. To urge the government to handle the matter rigorously, the Sub-branch and the Standing Committee of the Fifth District Party Headquarters jointly dispatched representatives to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters, explaining the situation. The outcome is said to be quite satisfactory.</p>

<p>▲Legal Provisions Do Not Include Organizing by Road</p>
<p>The Training Department of the Central Executive Committee issued an order yesterday to the Shanghai Joint Business Association, stating: "The Ministry has received a petition forwarded by the Central Secretariat from the Shanghai Special Municipality All Roads Business Community General Federation, requesting the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters to rescind the order to cease the Federation's activities, etc. Upon review, the Chamber of Commerce Law and the Industrial Guild Law, as well as their implementing regulations, have all been promulgated. Business organizations in all localities should be managed according to the law and should not object. However, the Chamber of Commerce Law and the Industrial Guild Law do not include provisions for establishing an association based on roads as units. The organization of the Shanghai Special Municipality All Roads Business Community General Federation is, therefore, difficult to sustain legally. In addition to instructing the Shanghai Special Municipality All Roads Business Community General Federation to accept the order of the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters to cease activities and to reorganize in accordance with the law, the Ministry hereby orders the Association to immediately and strictly instruct the Shanghai Special Municipality All Roads Business Community General Federation to comply and not delay under any pretext." A letter to this effect has been prepared and forwarded, hoping for compliance.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Factory Law Not to be Delayed <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>▲Executive Yuan Rejects the China Industrial Association's Request</p>
<p>The China Industrial Association, citing many difficulties in implementing the Factory Law immediately, specifically petitioned the Executive Yuan for a delay in implementation. The Executive Yuan, finding the reasons presented insufficient, issued an order to the Association, refuting each point. The original order stated: "Regarding the request of the Association for a delay in the implementation of the Factory Law, the Executive Yuan has instructed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to review and handle the matter, and has notified you accordingly. Furthermore, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has replied stating: 'The Secretariat of the Executive Yuan has forwarded a telegram from the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silk Cocoon General Association, requesting that the Factory Law be temporarily suspended for one year, which has been instructed to be reviewed and handled by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Now, a written request for a delay in implementation has been submitted, which should also be forwarded to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for review.' Upon detailed review, the reasons presented by the Association for requesting a delay in the implementation of the Factory Law are not very sufficient. The points are clarified below: (1) Article 8 of the Factory Law stipulates the principle of working hours. The original petition argued that there would be unfairness. Although the principle of working hours is uniformly limited to eight hours, for work that requires extended hours, the Factory Law allows for up to ten hours. If a factory has guard work that requires extended hours, it can be handled according to the regulations in that article. (2) Article 13 of the Factory Law prohibits night work for female workers. The original petition worried that this would affect the livelihoods of women and reduce the production capacity of cotton mills. The original intention of the law is that female workers' bodies, social morality, and family management are negatively affected by night work. Therefore, this regulation aims to improve the lives of most female workers. Before the implementation of the Factory Law, cotton mills could hire male workers, train them, and have them replace female workers. Thus, night work could be performed by male workers, and the two-shift system could still be applied, without reducing the production capacity of cotton mills. (3) Articles 15 to 18 of the Factory Law stipulate holidays and salary provisions. The original petition argued that there were too many holidays and increased burdens. The holiday dates have been approved by the National Government, with a total of seven national holidays per year. The method of paying daily workers for holidays and Sundays should be handled in accordance with legally valid collective agreements or work contracts. In the absence of such agreements or contracts, the method should be determined based on whether the work is long-term or short-term. This has been communicated by the Ministry to the provincial and municipal governments, instructing factories to be informed. There are already established guidelines for holidays and holiday pay for daily workers. Long-term workers should have regular and special leave, and wages should be paid during leave. This is necessary to relieve fatigue and improve work efficiency. The original petition only considered the economic aspects of factories and was biased. (4) Article 37 of the Factory Law stipulates that female workers receive pay during maternity leave. The original petition argued that there was no time limit and that there would be many abuses, and that paying wages during leave would increase the burden on factories. The article clearly stipulates that work should be suspended for eight weeks before and after childbirth, which does have a time limit. Childbirth is a natural duty of women, and the maintenance of their livelihood during childbirth is an obligation that humanity owes to women. Therefore, the factory should bear the cost of paying wages during maternity leave. (5) Chapter 10 of the Factory Law stipulates factory meetings. The original petition argued that labor and capital are on equal footing, infringing on factory management rights, and that Article 50 stipulates that disputes will be provoked. The agreed methods in this chapter cause factories to lose their legal benefits over property rights. Factory management is of common interest to both labor and capital, and it is appropriate for labor to participate in discussions. How can this be considered an infringement of management rights? Article 50 is intended to communicate the opinions of labor and capital and eliminate labor-capital conflicts. The original petition believed that none of these provisions did anything other than provoke disputes, but it is unclear on what basis this was said. The number of representatives to factory meetings is equal for labor and capital. Since the method of agreement is adopted, the resolution must be agreed upon by both parties. In this way, the legal benefits of the factory's property rights will not be lost. In summary, the Association did not understand the meaning of the law and did not provide detailed explanations, which inevitably led to misunderstandings. It is proposed that the Association be notified and instructed to prepare before the Factory Law is implemented, so that it can be followed when the time comes. Please review the various reasons for the Association's request for a delay, and whether they are justified."</p>

<p>▲Suzhou Provincial Public Security Bureau Continues to Detain Rice Boats Bound for Shanghai</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government sent a formal letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday regarding the case of two rice boats, Zhu Ating and Deng Hao San, bound for Shanghai, which were detained by the Suzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team. The letter requested that the Jiangsu Provincial Government immediately order their release. The original letter was entrusted to Fan Hesheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Northern Rice Industry Association, to personally present to the Suzhou Provincial Government for negotiation. The original letter stated: "The Suzhou Wangting rice boats bound for Shanghai were previously detained. A letter was sent requesting investigation and a telegram was sent to the Suzhou Municipal Government to immediately release them in order to maintain the people's food supply in Shanghai. Now, according to Fan Hesheng, the representative of the Shanghai Northern rice merchants, there is a second batch of detentions, which has a major impact on the price of food in Shanghai. He intends to go to your government to explain everything in person. Please review this letter and provide assistance for negotiation. Please also promptly instruct the Suzhou Municipal Government to release the detained rice boats as soon as possible. Sincerely, Mayor Zhang Qun." Furthermore, the Sui Feng Rice Mill at the intersection of Wuzhen Road, Zhabei, recently commissioned the Xie Sheng Rice Firm in Qiting Bridge, Yixing, to purchase 200 shi of japonica rice and brown rice due to the shortage of rice in Shanghai. The rice was loaded onto the Chen Zhaode boat, and after paying taxes and obtaining a bill of lading in Huang Po Dun, Wuxi, it was also detained by the First Detachment of the Water Patrol Team at Suzhou Chanmen Four Ferry. As a result, many rice boats from the inland that were bound for Shanghai turned back upon hearing the news and dared not pass through Suzhou. This is of great concern to the people's food supply and the price of rice in Shanghai. The factory has sent a letter to the Shanghai Northern Rice Dealers Association for assistance, which has been forwarded to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for investigation.</p>

<p>The Commercial Rectification Association sent a letter to the Zhabei Industrial Association yesterday, stating: "On April 7, we received a letter from the Shanghai Special Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs stating that the Bureau had received a letter asking whether the Zhabei Industrial Association could be allowed to reorganize into a trade association. Upon investigation, the organization of the Zhabei Industrial Association is essentially a disguised landlords' association. The legal rights of landlords are adequately protected by law. In June, the Association submitted procedures to the Bureau for registration, which was presented to the mayor for review. Subsequently, Order No. 1196 was received rejecting the request. It seems inappropriate to approve the Association's request to reorganize into a trade association. This is the information received from the Bureau. Therefore, the letter is being forwarded to you, and we hope that you will take note. To the Zhabei Industrial Association."</p>
<h3 id="e159">Exchange of Old Public Bonds for New Public Bonds <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>▲The Bureau of Finance Proposes Exchange Measures</p>
<p>▲The Municipal Government Approves Announcement in the Newspaper</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Finance, for the purpose of reorganizing old public bonds, has proposed measures for exchanging old public bonds for municipal public bonds, which have been approved by the Municipal Government for publication in the newspaper. The exchange will be entrusted to the Municipal Bank for rapid implementation. The measures are as follows: (1) Bridge and Road Public Bonds: (1) Holders of bridge and road public bonds issued by the former Zhabei Public Works and Patrol Donation Bureau may exchange them for municipal public bonds at the Shanghai Municipal Bank. (2) The exchange rate for bridge and road public bonds to municipal public bonds is 0.725 silver taels per yuan. (3) Bridge and road public bonds may be exchanged for municipal public bonds limited to the following types and amounts of principal and interest: (A) Un-drawn principal of 73,200 taels; (B) Drawn but unclaimed principal of 1,700 taels; (C) Unclaimed fourth-term interest of 45 taels; (D) Unclaimed fifth-term interest of 565 taels; (E) Unclaimed sixth-term interest of 755 taels; (F) Unpaid seventh, eighth, and ninth-term interest of 12,020 taels. (4) Holders of bond certificates falling under item A of Article 3 may combine the old bond certificate with the coupons for the seventh, eighth, and ninth terms and exchange them for municipal public bonds of equivalent value. If there is any remaining amount less than five yuan, it will be refunded in cash. If the old bond certificate has unclaimed interest for the fourth, fifth, and sixth terms, as mentioned in items C, D, and E of Article 3, they will be refunded in cash. (5) For bond certificates falling under item B of Article 3, in addition to exchanging the interest for the seventh and eighth terms, as mentioned in item F of Article 3, for municipal public bonds, the principal and the interest for the fourth, fifth, and sixth terms, as mentioned in items C, D, and E of Article 3, will be refunded in cash. (6) For the interest for the seventh and eighth terms, as mentioned in item F of Article 3, in addition to handling the attached interest coupons for undrawn and drawn but unclaimed bond certificates according to Articles 4 and 5, a separate interest payment voucher for the seventh and eighth terms will be issued for the bond certificates that have been redeemed. This voucher may be exchanged for municipal public bonds at the exchange rate. (7) Each exchange will be based on the total amount of bond certificates held by the bondholder and not on the number of bond certificates. That is, the total amount of bond certificates exchanged each time will be calculated together, and each bond certificate will not be calculated separately. (8) In addition to the principal and interest specified in Article 3, interest for the fourth term and above, and the eighth term and below, will not be calculated. (9) Old bond certificates will be exchanged for municipal public bonds at face value with no discounts. (10) If the exchange occurs after the due date for the interest of a certain term of the municipal public bonds, the coupon for that term should be detached. (2) Road Administration Public Bonds: (1) As the deadline for claiming outstanding road administration public bonds issued by the former Zhabei Public Works and Patrol Donation Bureau has passed and supplementary issues have been made, holders of these bonds must first register with the Bureau of Finance to conclude the matter. The registration period is from (date) to (date). Bonds that are not registered by the deadline will be invalid. (2) After registration is completed and the actual outstanding amount is determined, the Municipal Bank will be notified to exchange the bonds based on the registered certificates. (3) This exchange of old public bonds for municipal public bonds is limited to registered bonds. Bonds that are not registered will be invalid. (4) This exchange of old public bonds for municipal public bonds only accounts for the principal and does not account for interest. (5) This exchange of old public bonds for municipal public bonds uses the exchange rate of 0.725 silver taels per yuan. (6) Each exchange will be based on the total amount of bond certificates held by the bondholder and not on the number of bond certificates. That is, the total amount of bond certificates exchanged each time will be calculated together, and each bond certificate will not be calculated separately. (3) Yu Garden Public Bonds: The original amount of these public bonds was 10,000 yuan, of which 4,000 yuan has been repaid. The remaining outstanding principal is 6,000 yuan. The interest for the third term (due in June of this year) is 480 yuan, plus the unclaimed principal and interest for the second term, which is 264 yuan, for a total of 6,744 yuan. The exchange method is the same as Articles 7, 9, and 10 of the bridge and road bonds.</p>

<p>The Radio Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications stipulates that, except for radio operators serving in radio stations directly under the Ministry of Communications, radio operators on all other ship radio stations must pass an examination and be issued a license before they are allowed to serve. The Bureau has drafted temporary regulations for issuing licenses to ship radio operators, which have been submitted to the Ministry of Communications for review. Before the regulations are promulgated, the Bureau has obtained the Ministry's approval to temporarily issue temporary licenses to facilitate ship radio operators, in order to facilitate navigation. The Bureau's approved Ministry Order No. 1621 is recorded below: "Informed of the report. Ship communication is related to sovereignty. The temporary regulations for issuing licenses to ship radio operators have been revised and will be promulgated and implemented soon. Before these regulations are promulgated, all ship radio operators who request exemption from examination and issuance of temporary licenses due to being in transit should be temporarily accommodated and issued temporary licenses first, provided that the shipowner issues a certificate to prove their identity. Once the ship sails to Shanghai, they should take a supplementary examination. Those who fail the examination should have their licenses revoked to prevent abuse and facilitate navigation. You are hereby ordered to comply."</p>
<h3 id="e161">Resolution of the Case of French Sailor Stabbing Chinese <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>▲Fulfillment of Three Conditions</p>
<p>The case of the French sailor stabbing a Chinese person in the Catholic Church on the 30th of last month has been reported in previous newspapers. Subsequently, Mr. Du Yuesheng, in his capacity as a director of the French Concession, mediated with the trade union of the Commercial Press Publishing House. After several rounds of negotiations, both sides made concessions, and the three immediate measures directly related to the case were reluctantly narrowed down and resolved. The conditions agreed upon by both parties are as follows: (1) Mr. Du Yuesheng, in his capacity as a director of the French Concession, will convey the French Concession authorities' deep apologies to the trade union of the Commercial Press Publishing House. (2) The offending French sailor will be handed over to the commanding officer for punishment, with a five-year imprisonment. (3) Mr. Du will transfer 5,000 yuan for medical and recuperation expenses to the trade union of the Commercial Press Publishing House. Mr. Du then sent Mr. Wei with a letter of apology and 5,000 yuan in cash to the trade union of the Commercial Press Publishing House on Fourth Road on the evening of the 11th. After receiving it, the union distributed the money, with Song Derong receiving 3,350 yuan for medical and recuperation expenses, and Zhou Fugen receiving 1,250 yuan. On the 14th, a meeting of all group leaders was convened to report on the negotiation process. The union members were satisfied after receiving the report. The union also reported to the Municipal Party Headquarters for record. The report is recorded below: "Report on the matter of Song Derong, a member of this union, being stabbed by a French sailor. On April 1st, Comrade Wang Yongliang was dispatched to submit a report to your headquarters, requesting that you urgently telegram the government to file a serious protest. More than ten days have passed without a response. At this time of public anxiety, Mr. Du Yuesheng, in his capacity as a director of the French Concession, repeatedly sent representatives to request negotiations with this union. This union initially felt that this matter was of great importance and that we should not proceed with mediation without instructions from your headquarters. However, in fact, since the incident occurred, public opinion has been restricted and support has been very weak. Fearing that further delay would cause obstacles, we had no choice but to reluctantly narrow the scope and compromise on the three immediate measures directly related to the case after several rounds of negotiations with Mr. Du's representatives and Mr. Du himself. As for the two fundamental demands, which target imperialists around the world, we still request that your headquarters forward them to the Central Government and lead the national public with the spirit of revolution to confront all imperialists in order to achieve thoroughness. Although this union's strength is small, we dare to be in the vanguard and obey your instructions. Respectfully submitted."</p>

<h3 id="e168">Anti-Opium Association Protests Planting of Opium Seedlings in Southern Fujian <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>According to news from the Chinese National Anti-Opium Association, its investigation department received reports from citizens in various counties in Southern Fujian stating that opium prohibition is severely lax in the area. It is said that Southern Fujian has historically been a major opium-producing region. However, in recent years, due to strict government orders prohibiting opium, local authorities in various counties have paid some attention, and opium seedlings in various places have decreased slightly. Unexpectedly, recently in Jinjiang and Nan'an counties, more opium seedlings have been discovered. The county authorities not only fail to take action to suppress it, but instead collect fines based on the size of the opium-growing areas, ranging from several thousand to several hundred yuan. Areas planting opium are allowed to harvest the opium sap. Whether the area has already planted or is being cleared, fines must be paid, resulting in numerous abuses and widespread complaints. The local people are suffering immensely and have specifically appealed to the association for assistance. The association has sent a letter to the Central Opium Prohibition Committee requesting a thorough investigation. The letter is recorded below: To the esteemed Central Opium Prohibition Committee, Greetings. We received a report from citizens of Quanzhou, Fujian, stating that villagers in Maping Township of Jinjiang County and Xinying Township of the 38th District of Nan'an County in your province are planting opium seedlings in the hope of making large profits. The authorities in the two counties not only fail to strictly suppress and investigate, but instead collect fines and allow harvesting, which clearly violates the national government's opium prohibition laws. We request a vigorous investigation and handling of the matter. The planting of poisonous seedlings has long been strictly prohibited and investigated by the government, and the regulations for the eradication of opium seedlings in various counties have been repeatedly emphasized. However, in Jinjiang and Nan'an counties, where opium seedlings have been discovered, the local government only collects fines and does not eradicate them, which clearly constitutes condoning and accepting bribes. We are sending this letter to your esteemed committee requesting an investigation and response. The future of opium prohibition is of utmost importance. Respectfully submitted, Chinese National Anti-Opium Association.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Records of the Jisheng Society's Relief Work Conference <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Due to the urgent and frequent reports of disasters from various locations, the Chinese Jisheng Society held a relief work conference at its headquarters yesterday. Attendees included Chairman Wang Yiting, Vice Chairmen Xu Qianlin and Huang Hanzhi, and more than thirty committee members. After the meeting began, Chairman Wang briefly outlined the main points of the meeting and asked the relief work director to report on the disaster situation in various regions, distinguishing between urgent and non-urgent cases, and discussed the following actions: (1) The disaster situation in Taiwan is extremely severe. Last year, the society provided relief to Linhai, Ninghai, and other counties, allowing disaster victims to avoid hunger and cold amidst wind and snow. If spring relief is not continued, the previous efforts will be wasted. It was therefore decided that Director Feng Shaoshan should, after finishing the work in the Oujiang region, lead thirty-six relief workers to Taiwan to handle spring relief. (2) Spring relief in Baoying is being organized, the disaster situation is severe, and the need for funds is significant. Director Liu Shulun has repeatedly sent letters requesting additional funds. It was resolved that, as the originally planned amount is insufficient for distribution, an additional 6,000 yuan will be approved. (3) The disaster situation in Shaanxi Province is extremely tragic, and the number of refugees is increasing daily. If spring relief, including the provision of seeds, is not continued, the starving people will be left to die. It was resolved that, in addition to the existing relief workers stationed in Shaanxi, Director Zhang Xianqing should be publicly appointed to lead a number of relief workers to depart immediately and travel from Pingliang to Shaanxi. (4) Disaster victims from Shaanxi and Henan are congregating, transportation is blocked, and food supplies are cut off. For the sake of fundamental relief, immigration policies must be actively pursued. It was resolved that the society will be responsible for a certain number of immigrants from the province, who will be sent from Fengtai to outside the customs. Someone suggested that the four items currently proposed should be implemented concurrently and require urgent fundraising. In addition, there are dozens of places requesting relief that cannot be reached, which is regrettable. At a time when disasters are occurring everywhere, we have reached a point where there is nothing left to provide relief. However, we, living in safety, should think of danger and use our sincerity to appeal to heaven for harmony. Only by making extra efforts, hoping that society will follow suit, gathering more enthusiastic talents, and raising more relief funds can we save more people and create more good karma. This is what I would like to contribute to my colleagues. Someone else suggested that although the construction of river dikes and dams is being carried out in various regions, it is not an immediate solution to the urgent needs. If local philanthropists can vigorously promote agricultural irrigation, it will greatly benefit the people's livelihood. Its contribution is not small. Today, only by rewarding the production of agriculture and industry can we truly save the country. We should do it whenever possible within our ability. The public expressed sympathy. Finally, the economic committee spoke, stating that there is a significant shortage of funds at the meeting and that several tens of thousands of yuan should be advanced first to facilitate progress. It was publicly agreed to discuss and implement this matter at length. The bell rang, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>▲ The 17th Committee Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday at 4 PM, the Jiangsu Provisional Disaster Relief Association held its 17th committee meeting in the back hall of the Renji Hall on 6th Avenue. Chairman Wang Yiting reported on the following matters: (1) This week, we continued to remit 10,000 yuan for relief in Luhe County and 12,500 yuan for relief in Funing County, and we also subsidized 1,000 yuan for relief in Gaoyou County. (2) Chen Boda from Huangpu Township and Jiang Yufang from Xintuan Township in Xinghua County have sent letters successively reporting the disaster situation and requesting investigation and relief. These have been forwarded to Director Zhu for review and handling. (3) Director Hao telegraphed that the follow-up investigation of relief in Funing County has been completed and that it will be opened on a selected date. (4) Director Qiao telegraphed that the relief funds for Luhe County have arrived and will be opened upon the arrival of Mr. Liu Jusheng. One relief worker is sick. (5) We have repeatedly received telegrams from the Baoying Relief Branch and Mr. Liu Shulun stating that the disaster situation in the county is extremely tragic and have sent a package of wild vegetables eaten by the disaster victims to the association, requesting additional funds. We have also repeatedly received letters from the Jisheng Society, forwarding telegrams from Director Liu with the same information. The association has reluctantly added 3,000 yuan, which will still be distributed by the Jisheng Society. (6) Director Chen reported on the relief work in Yancheng County, which has been completed. (7) The amount of relief funds received this week. Matters for discussion: (1) Director Liu and Mr. Tian Luyu have telegraphed successively stating that the disaster situation in the southeast and west townships of Huai'an County is severe, with nearly 10,000 disaster-stricken households. It is estimated that 30,000 yuan will be needed for relief. In addition to the 20,000 yuan allocated by the association and the 3,000 yuan raised locally, Mr. Zhu Yusheng has agreed to raise 3,000 yuan, but there is still a significant shortfall. Please provide additional funds. The association's relief funds are extremely limited. How should we respond? Please make a public decision. (Public decision) We have telegraphed Mr. Zhu Yusheng to inquire whether he can raise additional funds in the Beijing-Tianjin area. We will discuss this further upon receiving his reply.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Tragic Fire in Nanshi Yesterday Morning Claims Three Lives <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Mother and Daughter Ascend to Save Grandmother</p>
<p>Three Generations of a Family Suffer Calamity</p>
<p>▲ Careless Use of Stove in Early Morning</p>
<p>▲ Staircase Burned Through in an Instant</p>
<p>▲ Deceased Known for Their Good Character</p>
<p>▲ Neighbors Deeply Mourn</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 6:10 AM, a fire broke out at No. 4, Ankang Lane, No. 48 Caojia Street, south of Caojia Bridge in the western city of Shanghai, destroying a three-bay, two-story Shikumen house and claiming three lives. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Family of Several Members. No. 4, Ankang Lane is a three-bay, two-story Shikumen house, and the house in the back row is also a three-bay, two-story Shikumen house. Both houses belong to the Gan family and are uninsured. The Gan family resides in the house in the back row, while the Shikumen house in the front row is rented to Zhang Bosun. Zhang is from Shanghai and his father, nicknamed Zhang Meimei, is from the Jing'an Temple area. He worked as a stable master at the Longfei Carriage Company in the Public Concession for many years. Zhang Bosun currently works at the Tianjin World Film Company. His family consists of his elderly mother, Zhang Liu, 61 years old, his wife, Zhang Wang, 39 years old, his daughter, Zhang Cuiying, 17 years old, his widowed sister-in-law, Zhang Huang, 31 years old, and Wang's four-year-old niece, Daxin. His son, Ziqin, is also 17 years old, the same age as Cuiying, and is currently an apprentice at a rice store in the northern city.</p>
<p>▲ Careless Use of Stove. Zhang Liu's bedroom was located on the upper floor behind the living room, while Zhang Huang lived in the east wing room on the upper floor in front of the living room. The second-floor room between them was sublet to a Gu family (a couple and an eight-year-old daughter). The second-floor room in the rear section of the east wing was rented to a Zhang family (a couple). The second-floor room in the west wing was occupied by Zhang Bosun's wife, Zhang Wang, and daughter Cuiying. The first-floor living room was jointly used. The first-floor room in the west wing was rented to Liu Zhang, and the first-floor room in the east wing was rented to the Zhong family. At 6:30 AM yesterday, the maid, Feng Guibao, of the Liu Zhang family got up and lit a wind stove in the rear section. After the charcoal fire was lit, she went to the tap in the courtyard to fetch water. When she returned, the room was already on fire, and the items beside the stove were quickly engulfed. She desperately cried for help and ran to the front section, dragging Liu Zhang out of bed. At that time, only the maids of each family had gotten up; the rest were still asleep. Because the fire was raging, the staircase was burned through in an instant. Because the staircase was located in the rear section of the west wing, everyone upstairs was trapped with no escape route after being awakened. The Gu couple immediately took their eight-year-old daughter, and Zhang Wang, holding her four-year-old daughter, jumped from the window and escaped unharmed, but they were injured and hired a car to go to the hospital for treatment. Zhang Huang and the four-year-old girl were unharmed, which was very fortunate.</p>
<p>▲ Sacrificing Themselves to Save Grandmother. Zhang Wang and Zhang Cuiying had already escaped downstairs when they suddenly heard Zhang Liu upstairs crying for help. Because Zhang Liu had suffered from paralysis last year and was unable to walk, she was confined to her bed all day. Therefore, the mother and daughter bravely risked their lives to ascend the stairs again, intending to rescue the grandmother. However, the fire had already penetrated the roof, resulting in the grandmother, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter, three generations of the family, all perishing in the disaster. Their pet dog, which was upstairs, was also burned to death. The fire was extinguished after about an hour, destroying a three-bay, two-story Shikumen house. Because it was surrounded by high walls, the neighboring houses were not affected, but the two Shikumen doors of the Gan family's house in the back row were reduced to ashes. The stone strips around the doors were scorched and cracked.</p>
<p>Alarm. The West District Fire Brigade was nearby. Upon hearing the alarm, Chief Xia immediately led employees to the scene with a fire engine and connected to the water supply to extinguish the fire. Soon, fire brigades from various districts also arrived and poured water on the surrounding area to extinguish the fire. After the firefighters went upstairs and rescued Zhang Liu, Zhang Wang, and Zhang Cuiying, all three were already dead. Their bodies were placed in the alley at the entrance. The three had mostly suffocated from the smoke. Their heads and limbs were intact, but Cuiying's waist and Zhang Wang and Zhang Liu's faces and hands were burned.</p>
<p>▲ Taken to the Station for Preliminary Examination. After the incident, the police took the Liu Zhang family's maid, Feng Guibao, the two landlords (i.e., Zhang Bosun's family)'s maid, Qu Wushi, and the Zhong family's maid, Cai Fengshi, a total of four people, to the Second Precinct, Second Branch Police Station. Director Meng questioned them. According to Liu Zhang, she is 59 years old, from Shanghai, and has only one daughter. She recruited a Liu man as her son-in-law, who is now serving in the military and is not in Shanghai. Her daughter had just arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and is currently staying with relatives in Wenyuan Lane in the French Concession. This morning, I had not gotten up yet. According to the maid, Feng Guibao, she lit the stove carelessly, causing the fire, etc. When questioned, Feng Guibao, 26 years old, from Songjiang, stated that she had only been working as a maid for Liu Zhang for three days. This morning, after getting up, I went to the rear section to light the stove to boil water. When I carried the kettle to the tap to fetch water, I saw the room was full of fire. I was terrified and cried for help, waking up my mistress (referring to Liu Zhang) and escaping, etc. Qu Wushi, 31 years old, from Yangzhou, stated that she had only been working as a maid for the Zhang family for over ten days. This morning, after getting up, I finished washing the chamber pot and was about to go upstairs when I suddenly saw the staircase filled with fire. I was terrified and cried for help. At the same time, I poured two buckets of water onto the fire, trying to extinguish it, but it was a drop in the bucket. I had no choice but to flee for my life, etc. Cai Fengshi, 50 years old, from Taicang, stated that her master (referring to the Zhong family) had just moved in on February 26th of this year. I have been working for the Zhong family for a long time. This morning, a fire broke out upstairs. I had already gotten up, but there was no way to extinguish it. I could only shout to the people inside to escape quickly, etc. Director Meng obtained their statements and instructed them to remain for investigation to ascertain the true cause of the fire before making a decision. Qu Wushi and Cai Fengshi, being uninvolved, were released.</p>
<p>▲ Examining the Bodies. Patrolman Jin Qiren from the 22nd Precinct reported the incident to the District Court for an inquest. At about 3 PM, Inspector Liu Pingfan, commissioned by the court, arrived with examiner Shen Xiqing to conduct the inquest. They confirmed that Zhang Liu, Zhang Wang, and Zhang Cuiying had died from fire and completed the autopsy report, ruling that the relatives of the deceased should collect the bodies separately for burial. A huge crowd of people came to watch. When the judge was conducting the inquest, Zhang Liu's daughter, Fan Zhang (named Xiudi), rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and cried bitterly. The bodies were placed on planks covered with cotton padding and reed mats, appearing extremely tragic. The neighbors in the area all said that the deceased were very good people and that their fate was truly unfortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Gambler Embezzles Public Funds and Asks to be Sentenced to Death <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>▲ Claims He Has No Face to See Anyone</p>
<p>▲ Words Expressing Desire for Death are Quite Sad</p>
<p>▲ If Only He Had Known This Would Happen</p>
<p>▲ Those Addicted to Gambling Should Wake Up Early</p>
<p>Shen Jiatai, from Shanghai, was employed by the Haiwei Foreign Firm on Jiujiang Road in September of last year, serving as an accountant. However, he was addicted to gambling, constantly losing. His monthly salary was not enough to cover his losses, resulting in significant debts. At the end of last year, he embezzled 1,089 taels, one mace, and nine candareens of account money collected by the firm, as well as 139.4 yuan of the firm's electricity bill payable to the Radio Telegraph Bureau, to cover his debts. Fortunately, this was not discovered. However, his gambling habit did not change, and his methods of embezzlement changed with the times. He did not embezzle account money but signed a check for 1,000 taels in the name of the firm's foreign manager, David, and fraudulently obtained cash from the Hongsheng Money Exchange on Sichuan Road. He went to the gambling den, hoping to win and cover up his previous misdeeds. However, he lost everything and returned empty-handed, finally regretting his actions. He was deeply afraid that the foreign manager would discover his misdeeds, resulting in even more severe punishment. Therefore, he confessed the matter the day before yesterday, hoping to be forgiven. However, David, upon hearing his confession, considered it impossible to forgive and reported it to the police station, which sent detectives to arrest Shen. Yesterday, he was taken to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Xu interrogated him. The Hongsheng Money Exchange also knew the details and hired lawyer Jiang Baoli to attend the court to request the return of the 1,000 taels embezzled by Shen, equivalent to 1,386 yuan in foreign currency. When questioned, Shen Jiaqin fully admitted to all the accusations and stated that he had no face to see anyone and requested the court to sentence him to death. His words were quite sad. It is truly a case of "one wrong step leading to eternal regret." Judge Xu concluded the interrogation and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody pending sentencing on a scheduled date.</p>

<p>▲ Wife Sues Him in Court</p>
<p>▲ Demanding 300,000 Yuan in Alimony</p>
<p>▲ Both Parties in Reconciliation</p>
<p>Fu Pingui, a wealthy merchant residing at No. 759 Xiafei Road in the French Concession, previously married Shao Aiqin as his wife. However, several years ago, Fu had an affair with his wife's younger sister, Shao Jinchi, and formally married her at a certain clan hall. Afterwards, he abandoned his legal wife, Shao Aiqin, ignoring her. Therefore, Shao Aiqin hired lawyer Li Xinyang to file a lawsuit in the French court, accusing Fu Pingui of abandonment and bigamy, and requesting compensation for alimony. After the presiding judge approved the summons, the defendants, Fu Pingui and Shao Jinchi, did not appear. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, the first defendant married the plaintiff in the first year of the Republic of China. After they were married, they were initially harmonious. Later, the first defendant became involved with the plaintiff's younger sister, disregarding the crime of bigamy, and secretly married her. The defendants not only abandoned the plaintiff but also abused the plaintiff together with Shao Jinchi. As a result, the plaintiff was forced to borrow money to make a living. The plaintiff is seeking 300,000 yuan in alimony. Since the defendant has 240,000 yuan in deposits at the Bank of Communications and the defendant's residence is worth over 200,000 yuan, the plaintiff is seeking to provisionally seize the defendant's deposits to protect the plaintiff's interests before the case is concluded. The defendants' lawyers, Lu Shaozong and Lu Jianai, argued that the defendants were unable to appear in court due to illness and requested a postponement of the trial. The plaintiff's lawyer strongly opposed the provisional seizure and requested its dismissal. It was ruled that the decision on the provisional seizure would be made later. Another summons was issued yesterday. Judge Zhu ruled that as the case concerned the issue of alimony, all deposits at the Bank of Communications could not be moved before the case was concluded. Following this ruling, the lawyers for both parties stated that both parties were in the process of reconciliation and requested a postponement of the trial. The judge approved the request and postponed the hearing for two weeks.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Special District Court Hears Kidnapping Case Yesterday <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>▲ Wushi Elementary School Student Kidnapped</p>
<p>▲ Testified in Court Yesterday About the Kidnapping</p>
<p>▲ One of the Kidnappers Still Trying to Deny Involvement</p>
<p>▲ The Small Leather Shoes Were Also Presented as Evidence</p>
<p>Chief Inspector Feng Baishun of the General Police Headquarters previously arrested four kidnappers: Chen Kangsheng, Zhu Guoliang, Qian Yiqing, and Shi Maozi, and recovered the hostage, Guan Xiong, a nine-year-old boy from Yongjia District, who resided at No. 358 Pike Road. The boy was handed over to his family, and the four kidnappers were detained pending interrogation, as previously reported.</p>
<p>▲ Boy Tells How He Was Kidnapped. Yesterday afternoon, the case was heard in the third court of the Special District Local Court. The presiding judge was Sun Yuan. First, the police detectives brought the defendants to court.</p>
<p>The child was questioned about the kidnapping. According to the child, he was a second-grade student at Wushi Elementary School. On the afternoon of the 24th of last month, at 4 PM, he was on his way home from school on Xinzha Road when he met the defendant Chen Kangsheng and was tricked into staying at his house for two days. He was then taken to a hotel near the North Railway Station for one night and later moved to the Daxin Hotel. During the day, he and Chen would go out to play. He knew Chen before. He had never seen the other defendants before.</p>
<p>▲ Testimony of the Daxin Hotel Tea Waiter. The tea waiter of the Daxin Hotel, Mao Hesheng, testified that the defendant Chen Kangsheng brought the boy and checked into room 45 at about 8 PM. They then went out together and returned to the room at midnight. The next morning at 9 AM, they went out again. At 8 PM that night, they returned again. That night, Chen went out again to buy American ginseng, leaving Sun alone in the room. The boy then cried loudly and called out for his brother. I went into the room to comfort him. Not long after, detectives arrived and took the child away.</p>
<p>▲ Qian Yiqing Was the Mastermind. The defendant Chen Kangsheng confessed that the case was masterminded by Qian Yiqing. Qian gave me 50 yuan beforehand. Zhu Guoliang was also invited by Qian. He also hired a lawyer to defend himself.</p>
<p>▲ Zhu Guoliang Invites Friends to Testify. Zhu Guoliang stated that he worked at the Commercial Press. At 10 PM on the 28th of last month, he was arrested near the Qianjiang Guild Hall on Wenjian Si Road on his way home from work. He refused to confess to the kidnapping and hired lawyer Ye Fucong to defend him. Qian Yiqing stated that he arrived in Shanghai from Yixing by train on the night of the 28th to visit a friend named Zhong at the Daxin Hotel and was arrested. He denied any involvement in the kidnapping. Wang Jianqiu, a staff member of the typesetting department of the Commercial Press, testified on Zhu Guoliang's behalf, saying that Zhu was very honest and would not commit kidnapping.</p>
<p>▲ Detective Describes the Arrest. Ma Xiaozhi, the detective in charge of the case, reported the circumstances of the arrest of Chen and Zhu, stating that he first arrested Chen Kangsheng at the intersection of Wenjian Si Road and North Henan Road on the night of the 28th. Zhu was about ten yards away from Chen when he saw Chen being arrested and looked alarmed, so Zhu was also arrested. At the time, Chen admitted that Zhu was an accomplice. A pair of small leather shoes found in Qian Yiqing's suitcase were presented as evidence, and it was said that Qian had bought these shoes for the child to wear. At this point, the court ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Continuing Report on the Dismantling of a Kidnapper's Den: More Accomplices and Military Arms Seized <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>▲ Featuring Fake Official Seals and Appointment Letters</p>
<p>▲ Charges Include Counter-Revolution and Robbery</p>
<p>▲ Final Decision Pending Review</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that Hongkou police detectives discovered fake official seals, appointment letters, and a large sum of Dongbei (Northeast China) currency in a kidnapper's den on Tongchun Lane, Gongping Road, and that the four male and female suspects, including Lin Jinhan, were handed over to the Higher Court's preliminary trial division on charges related to counter-revolution. This case made further progress the day before yesterday. Detectives Zhang Bingcheng and Wang Runhe, along with officers He Xiaozhi and Zhang Faxiang, arrested Yu San from Suzhou at Room 429 of the Dazhonghua Hotel on Xizang Road in the same day. They then searched Yu San's home at 404 Tangjia Lane, where they found a Mauser pistol, three handguns, twenty-four bullets, and gold jewelry in a suitcase. Subsequently, at 6 Leyi Road, An Nanjing Road, and in Baoyu Lane, Caishi Street, they apprehended Nie Yinfu from Jiangbei and Bao Yongchang from Ningbo. Finally, in conjunction with the First Precinct of the Fifth District of Zhabei, they apprehended Wu Rongsheng, a local, and his concubine, Lin Qiaoyun, at Room 8 of the Yuegong Hotel on North Sichuan Road. These two individuals were temporarily detained at the relevant police station, while Yu, Nie, and Bao were taken back to the police station for further investigation.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The investigation revealed that since January of this year, the three suspects had committed numerous armed robberies against merchants and civilians on North Sichuan Road, North Suzhou Road, Ningbo Road, and other locations in the concession. The 2,000 yuan of Dongbei currency found when Zhao Jiaying was apprehended at 97 Chongqing Road was, in fact, the loot obtained from these robberies. Since the previous four suspects, including Lin Jinhan, had been handed over to the Higher Court, Yu, Nie, and Bao, as accomplices, were also brought to the Higher Court yesterday morning. Judge Ye Zaichou presided over a preliminary trial in the Second Tribunal. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi briefly outlined the case and requested that a letter be sent to the Public Security Bureau to transfer Wu Rongsheng and Lin Qiaoyun to the case for questioning. Yu and Nie confessed to committing multiple robberies and stated that Wu Rongsheng was the ringleader and Lin Qiaoyun was responsible for delivering firearms to them. Bao Yongchang only admitted to being involved in the robbery on Tiantong'an Road in Zhabei. However, Bao completely denied the charges. Judge Ye stated that whether the case would be handled as a counter-revolutionary crime or a robbery crime under criminal law would depend on further review. He then ordered that Yu and the other two be detained and adjourned the court.</p>

<p>▲ To Maintain Traffic Flow on Baoshan Road</p>
<p>Baoshan Road in Zhabei is a vital transportation artery in northern Shanghai. However, the Songhu branch line of the Jinghu-Hangzhou Railway bisects it, causing inconvenience to vehicles, pedestrians, and other travelers. Recently, the number of steam passenger trains traveling on the Songhu line has increased to seventy-four trips per day, more than double the previous number. Consequently, traffic congestion on Baoshan Road has become increasingly severe. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, the Bureau of Public Works, and the Sixth District Party Headquarters of the city have all submitted documents requesting the Municipal Government to consult with the Ministry of Railways. The request is to order the Railway Bureau to swiftly relocate the Songhu branch station to the eastern end of Baoshan Road to facilitate transportation. It is reported that the Municipal Government has submitted the request to the Ministry of Railways for review and action.</p>

<p>This year, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway will, as in previous years, operate a special train to Hangzhou for the Qingming Festival. It is scheduled to depart from the North Shanghai Railway Station at 5:20 PM on the afternoon of the 17th and return to Shanghai at 6:50 PM on the afternoon of the 21st. Only 500 tickets will be available, and they will be sold exclusively by the China Travel Service. According to the company's sources, although the past few days have been marked by continuous rain, the pre-sale of these tickets has been enthusiastic. Yesterday, with the weather clearing up, the number of people purchasing tickets became even more crowded.</p>

<p>The string orchestra organized by the Municipal Council, in conjunction with the Shanghai Yiyue Society, which is organized by Chinese citizens, and over one hundred and twenty renowned musicians from Britain, the United States, and Russia residing in Shanghai, will hold a grand concert with vocal performances at the Municipal Auditorium on Nanjing Road on the 17th, 19th, and 22nd. The string orchestra will have over fifty musicians participating in the performance. The lyrics to be sung are from the famous Italian piece "The Passion of Christ". The rights to perform this piece are exclusive in various countries, and it cannot be performed in public venues without the author's permission. Therefore, the string orchestra, under the direction of Mr. Paixi, specifically requested permission from the original author through the Italian Consul stationed in Shanghai, thus securing the opportunity for a public performance. Such an opportunity is truly rare, and as a result, the demand for seats has been very high in recent days.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Two Small Vessels Exchange Fire Outside Wusong Estuary <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 4:00 AM, as the sky was dim, a gray-colored small vessel was seen chasing a yellow-colored small vessel on the waters of Sanjiashui, outside the Wusong Estuary. The two vessels were exchanging gunfire during the chase. The pursuit lasted about half an hour, after which the yellow vessel, being faster, sailed towards the Yangtze River and escaped. The gray vessel, seeing that it was difficult to catch up, also sailed into the Wusong Estuary. As the two vessels were exchanging fire, bullets were flying in all directions. A northbound sand barge, the Zhang Fasheng, happened to be arriving at the location, and a crew member, Mr. Wang, was almost hit by a stray bullet. Barely avoiding disaster, the barge quickly turned towards the open sea to take temporary shelter. After seeing the two vessels move away, it resumed its journey and entered the port at 9:00 AM yesterday. After receiving the report, the authorities, suspecting the two vessels, have dispatched detectives to investigate the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Commissioner General Quo Naide Discusses Police Force Promotion Issues <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Wenhui Bao reports that today (the 15th), a reporter visited Quo Naide, Commissioner General of the Public Concession Police, and discussed the issue of police force promotions. Quo stated that he was on loan to Shanghai and would leave as soon as his work was completed. However, he currently had no news as to when that would be. When the reporter inquired about who would succeed him in the future, and whether it would be Martin, the newly promoted Extra Commissioner General, Quo replied that it might be so, but he did not know. It is noted that Martin is the most senior member of the police force. When Padler took leave recently, while Quo Naide was still investigating police affairs, Martin acted as the Commissioner General. Now that he has been promoted from Deputy Commissioner to Extra Commissioner General, it is likely that he will be the one to succeed Quo in command of the police. In addition, Assistant Commissioners General Chuntian, Boone, and Aylward have been newly promoted to Deputy Commissioners General. Also, Assistant Commissioner General Wheeler has been reassigned to the position of Assistant to the Commissioner General after leaving the Provisional Court. As for the date of Commissioner General Quo's departure from Shanghai, the reporter speculates that it will be around October of last year.</p>
<h3 id="e184">The National Grand Music of the Datong Music Society <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>On Sunday afternoon, the Shanghai YMCA, in conjunction with various organizations, held a welcoming ceremony for the National Games athletes at the Central Auditorium. One of the performances was the National Grand Music by the Datong Music Society. The term "Grand Music" (大樂) first appeared in the History of the Liao Dynasty. This performance was divided into five movements: 1. Greater China, representing the Eastern continent; 2. Divine Land's Atmosphere, representing the national character; 3. Unified Land, representing harmony under heaven; 4. Embroidered Universe, representing prosperity and joy; and 5. Gathering of Talents, representing the rise of talented individuals. The composition method completely adopted a type of mixed brocade style from ancient music, mostly reinterpreting old melodies into new ones. However, at the transition between the two movements, a solo interlude was added as a bridge, making the musical characteristics of the five movements, which are different from each other, come together in one breath. For example, the first movement is solemn, the second is peaceful, the third is heroic, the fourth is joyful, and the fifth is exhilarating. Listening to it is like the mixing of water and milk. The tempo gradually increases, and the melody is first plain and then wonderful, like being on a mountain path, making people overwhelmed. The grand orchestra originally had thirty-two members, but due to the rain, only fifty people attended. The instruments used were mostly rare items, arranged in high, medium, and low sections. It is said that the society has recently invented many lost ancient polyphonic instruments and is currently engaged in their manufacture.</p>
<h3 id="e185">The Status of the Police in Higher Court Appeals Cases <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The China Press reports that a rather interesting question was raised in the Second Higher Court yesterday (the 14th), namely, the status of the police when a defendant disagrees with the judgment of the Special District Court and files an appeal. The case being heard was that on March 8th, some people at the Ewo Wharf attempted to intimidate and extort three yuan. The District Court sentenced one to twenty months imprisonment and the other to two and a half years. The defendant disagreed and appealed to the Higher Court. After the prosecutor rebutted the reasons presented by the appellant's lawyer, the police lawyer also rose to make a rebuttal. Judge Sun then instructed him to pay attention to a fact: that in the second instance, the prosecutor represents the government as the respondent in the case, and the police lawyer can only express opinions or provide explanations in court, but cannot act as the respondent. The police lawyer argued that the police were the original plaintiffs and should be the respondents; otherwise, if the appellant wins the appeal, who will file another appeal? If the appellant is acquitted in the future, can the police file another appeal? It is unknown whether there are any regulations regarding this matter. The judge then ruled that regarding this point, a verdict would be announced on the 18th, but that in the future, the police's right to be the respondent would only be denied.</p>

<p>The Zhabei Second Section Fire Brigade's current headquarters are rented, which is not a long-term solution. Former presidents Xie, Chen, Fu, and Dai, along with various directors, have made donations to purchase a plot of land at the intersection of Yongxing Road and Minde Road to build their own headquarters. However, due to the difficulty in raising construction funds, construction has not yet started. Now, the brigade believes that the old headquarters is becoming increasingly dilapidated and can no longer be delayed. Therefore, they proposed last year to build a new headquarters. The municipal authorities approved the raising of special donations. Since the distribution of the donation booklets, the executive committee of the brigade has sent letters to the directors requesting donations from all sectors of society, and the results have been satisfactory. All information has been published in the newspapers. It is now heard that the brigade is eagerly gathering the donated funds to begin construction as soon as possible, so they have been compiling the donated amounts in recent days to further organize the process. However, they are deeply concerned that the current donations will not be sufficient. Therefore, the brigade has again requested the directors to strongly encourage donations, and the volunteer members are also appealing separately. Their enthusiasm is commendable. Moreover, the directors of the brigade are mostly Shanghai philanthropists, and they are all willing to assist in the construction of the brigade's headquarters in view of the brigade's usual service performance. This matter should easily become a reality. Currently, the brigade is engaged in handling the drawings for the new building and the construction project plan. The date of commencement of construction should not be far off.</p>

<p>Shiliupu in this city is located in a vital area with heavy traffic. Since the completion of Dongmen Road, the city has been renewed, and it is necessary to thoroughly reorganize traffic. In view of this, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has sent personnel to conduct on-site inspections and has formulated three main points for improvement: (1) Establish one-way routes, stipulating that vehicles going south must turn from the Outer Bund, and vehicles going north must turn from the Inner Bund, in order to avoid congestion. Signs will be installed to facilitate traffic police in directing traffic; (2) In addition to arranging parking lots, the area in front of the public land on the north side of Dongmen Road, which was previously designated as a parking lot by the Bureau of Public Works, will be arranged as a parking place for automobiles and rickshaws. White paint will be used to mark the boundaries and install signs; (3) Relocate the tram stop. The current tram stop at the Outer Bund entrance of the China Merchants Route tram is very close to the designated parking lot on the north side, which can easily obstruct traffic. Therefore, it must be moved to the Inner Bund entrance, where the road surface is wider, and a platform will be built to facilitate passengers getting on and off. It is now learned that the China Merchants Electric Company has been ordered to comply with the first item regarding the relocation of the tram stop, and the other two items are also being prepared. They should be completed soon.</p>

<p>The deadline for renewing the business licenses of brokers at various exchanges has long passed. It is reported that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce originally intended to stop renewals immediately. However, since there were still many who had not yet applied for renewal, the ministry made a special accommodation, limiting the supplementary renewal to before February 15 of this year. It was also stated that if renewal applications were not submitted beyond the deadline, the licenses they had received would be declared invalid. Now that the deadline has passed, it has been decided to stop renewals. All broker business licenses issued by the former Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce that have not been verified cannot serve as brokers unless they are newly registered.</p>

<p>The Donggou Pier for the Municipal Pudong Ferry, which was accidentally damaged by the Nissin Company's Yuanjiang Maru vessel on the morning of January 29, was repaired by the company at the request of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities. The company readily agreed to repair the pier according to the report of the Maritime Affairs Bureau. It is now learned that the repair project has been completed. The bureau sent personnel to inspect it a few days ago and was quite satisfied, and formally accepted it.

<p>▲ Compensating for Losses of 3,500 Taels</p>
<p>A certain ship of the Sanbei Steamship Company collided with the Municipal Council pier at the Pujiang Riverbank when it entered port on April 25 of last year. The Municipal Council subsequently repaired it, costing 3,500 taels of silver. A claim was made to Yu Qiaqing, the manager of Sanbei, who fully acknowledged it. However, the money had not been paid to the Municipal Council for a long time. Recently, a lawyer filed a lawsuit against Yu, and the Special District Court held a hearing on it once. Due to the absence of the defendant, the case was postponed. Yesterday morning, Judge Ying held a hearing again. The defendant was represented by lawyer Jiang Yiping, who acknowledged the loss but requested exemption from the interest claimed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff's lawyer subsequently stated that they were willing to waive the interest. Judge Ying then announced the verdict, ordering the defendant to repay the plaintiff 3,500 taels of silver in losses and bear the litigation costs.</p>

<p>The court clerks of the civil and criminal divisions of the Special District Court are mostly former employees of the Provisional Court. Their monthly salary in the Provisional Court era was 22 yuan. Yesterday, the General Affairs Section of the Special District Court, under the order of the president of the court, announced that the court clerks' salary would be 14 yuan per month. After hearing this, the court clerks felt uneasy. In the afternoon, the court clerks gathered in a corner to discuss with each other, believing that at this time of high rice prices and rising living standards, the original salary was already insufficient, and now it has been reduced by 8 yuan per month, how can they maintain a living? They now plan to gather all the court clerks to petition President Yang, begging him to consider their difficult lives and withdraw the order to cut salaries, so as to avoid the sigh of being too hungry to serve the public. It is unknown whether they will be granted approval.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Nanjing Central Broadcasting Wireless Station has spared no effort in rectification. In addition to ordering a 50-kilowatt broadcasting transmitter from Germany, which will take about a year to broadcast, the current power of the original motor generator set has been increased for improvement in the meantime. It is heard that last month, a 0.0005 microfarad variable capacitor was ordered from the China Tri-Pole Company on Avenue Joffre in this city for application. It is said that the device can handle over 10,000 volts of electricity and is rare even in foreign countries. The device has now been transported to Nanjing. After testing by the broadcasting station, the results were excellent, and the company was highly praised. A photo of the device is attached above.</p>

<p>▲ For Those Who Have Applied But Not Yet Been Issued</p>
<p>▲ Temporary Deputy Agents Can Be Requested</p>
<p>The Ministry of Justice had previously announced that all foreign lawyers who wished to represent parties in the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court and the Special District Court must apply to the Ministry of Justice for a lawyer's certificate before April 15, and register with the Higher Court as a foreign lawyer practicing in Shanghai. Many have complied with the order to apply for certificates and request registration. Yesterday was the deadline set by the Ministry. In the morning, Judge Ying of the Civil Division of the Special District Court, while hearing a case, saw two British lawyers, Gao and Yiniu, in court, and immediately informed them of the matter, saying that today was the last day for foreign lawyers to appear in this court without a certificate. After this, they must have a lawyer's certificate issued by our country's Ministry of Justice to represent foreigners in court and perform their duties. If any foreign lawyer has applied to the Ministry of Justice but has not yet been issued a certificate, they will also not be able to appear in court temporarily after this. However, if they need to appear in court to handle a case, the remedy is to ask a foreign lawyer who has already obtained a certificate to be a temporary deputy agent. In complying with the Ministry's order, there is still an intention to maintain the situation.</p>

<p>Recently, the shoulder-carrying workers at the wharf of the Pudong Haiyang Society have been divided into two gangs, the Hubei and Qingkou gangs. Yesterday morning, the two gangs fought over business, each gathering countless workers from their own gang, holding carrying poles and iron bars, and fighting each other. The police officers stationed at the wharf were unable to stop them, so they reported to the Second Precinct of the Third District, who sent police to arrest them. However, the Qingkou gang had already been beaten and injured, including Dai Si, Ren San, Yu Chunyuan, Wang Daoqing, Liu Anhua, Zhang Guangsheng, Ge Chuanpei, and others. The Hubei gang was also injured, including Sun Quanshan, Wang Yancheng, and Liu Qingfu, but the injuries were slightly less severe. When the police arrived, the bloody scene had stopped, but many people were lying on the ground. The police then took the leaders of the fight, Wu Ansong, Wei Hesheng, Qiu Kuncheng, Rong Zihua, and related person Li Alin, as well as the injured, to the station. After questioning by Chief Tang, they were sent to the District Court for investigation in the afternoon.</p>

<p>▲ Effective from the 20th of this Month</p>
<p>Since its opening, the Public Bus Company of the Public Concession in this city has seen increasing prosperity in its business. Currently, it operates five routes: Route 1, Route 3, Route 4, Route 5, and Route 7. Now, due to the gradual expansion of the company's scope, its income is all in copper coins. The exchange rate has recently depreciated, which has had a significant impact. In addition, internal staff and ticket sellers have repeatedly requested salary increases.

<p>▲ The Police Still Claimed to Be Investigating His Name</p>
<p>An assassination occurred at the entrance of Yongqing Lane, Jinjia House, Avenue Edouard VII, Xinza District, on the morning of the day before yesterday at 11:30 AM. The deceased was a boy of about fifteen or sixteen years old, and the murderer fled the scene. Details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. After the incident, the Xinza District Police Department dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. They found a bullet casing and questioned nearby residents. Most of them did not know the situation at the time, only Hu Awu, a candy vendor at the entrance of Yongqing Lane, and Zheng Hu, a vegetable vendor at the Avenue Edouard VII vegetable market, who happened to be passing by carrying vegetables, heard the sound of gunfire. Hu and the detectives took the body to the Forensic Examination Office on Rue Pére Robert and asked the two of them to go to the office to testify during the examination. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo from the Special District Court arrived at the office and confirmed that the deceased had been shot twice, once in the head and once in the back. He then ascended to the official seat, first the foreign police chief presented the bullet casing he picked up, and then Hu Awu and Zheng Hu arrived to testify one after another, only saying that before the gunshots, they saw two people walking and passing by the entrance of the lane, and then heard two gunshots and saw a young man fall to the ground. As for the appearance of the murderer, they could not prove it. After Prosecutor Guo completed the examination and interrogation, because the police investigation had not yet revealed the name of the deceased and there were no family members, he instructed the Pushan Cemetery to issue a guarantee for the burial of the body.</p>

<p>▲ A Scandal at Room 73 of the Huayang Hotel</p>
<p>Wang Weixin, who is currently 24 years old, and his cousin Su Ying have developed love for each other and have obtained the consent of both parents to marry. However, Weixin, with his goal achieved, spends his days playing with Su Ying at various entertainment venues in Puxi. Weixin's mother, seeing that he was wasting money, sent Weixin to his cousin's (Su Ying's brother) place in Puxi (living in Mingde Lane, Hanqiao Tu, Zhabei) for a temporary stay. Unexpectedly, Weixin had an affair with his sister-in-law, forgetting Su Ying. Su Ying, seeing that Weixin had not returned home for a long time, crossed the river to Mingde Lane the day before yesterday under the pretense of visiting her brother and sister-in-law to find out what was going on. Unexpectedly, she did not see her sister-in-law and Weixin. Knowing that something was wrong, after a while, she saw Weixin and her sister-in-law returning home one after another. The next day, the sister-in-law made an excuse to go out shopping and walked out with Weixin. Su Ying remained calm and secretly followed them. Sure enough, she saw Weixin and her sister-in-law entering the Huayang Hotel at the railway station. Su Ying sneaked in, found out that Weixin and her sister-in-law had opened Room 73 together, and immediately ran to tell her brother (who was working in his transportation company nearby) and went to the hotel together to arrest them. The head of the Haining Road Police Station, because the incident occurred in the Chinese area, transferred them to the First Precinct of the Fourth District for interrogation.</p>

<p>▲ Shanghai Special City Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>(G) Labor Facilities: The improvement and compilation of statistics on labor facilities should have at least two major objectives. First, to improve the treatment and living conditions of workers so that they can work with peace of mind and eliminate labor-management conflicts in the bud. Second, to fully develop the workers' abilities, increase production efficiency, and reduce the occurrence of disasters, which indirectly increases social production and solves the people's livelihood. Since labor facilities have such an important mission, governments and employers in various countries are making efforts in this area. The scope of labor facilities can be divided into three major categories: (1) Regarding the safety of workers' bodies, such as factory safety and hygiene equipment. (2) Regarding various welfare undertakings, such as insurance, savings, relief, and other systems, as well as consumer cooperatives. (3) Regarding the physical and mental development of workers, such as worker education and entertainment. (H) Other: Statistics on the relationship between individual workers and their social life. The above items are only the most important and largest. Other surveys, such as apprenticeship systems, worker turnover rates, and work systems, can also be conducted to the best of one's ability. (I) Labor Unions: A labor union is an association of workers. According to the recently promulgated Labor Union Law of the National Government, "Any male or female worker in the same industry or occupation may form a labor union for the purpose of increasing knowledge and skills, developing production, maintaining and improving working conditions and livelihood, by gathering industrial workers over the age of sixteen who are currently engaged in business, with a number of more than one hundred people, or workers in the same occupation with a number of more than fifty people", and organize labor unions in accordance with the law. The freedom of workers to form associations and meetings has been achieved only after decades or hundreds of years of struggle in foreign countries. The Chinese Kuomintang has always called for supporting farmers and workers. Since the National Government unified China, it has promulgated the Labor Union Law, recognizing that labor unions have legal personalities and can represent the meaning and behavior of general members. Therefore, the initial step in studying the combination and activities of worker groups is to compile labor union statistics. The important items include the number of labor unions, the number of members, business classification, region, date of establishment, experience of staff, number of related factories, and tasks of labor unions, all of which should be studied.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Random Notes After Liang Zhongjia's Death <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Xiang</p>
<p>Russia insulted us, humiliated our national sovereignty, and invaded our territory. I sent Liang Zhongjia to lead troops to defend against them. Unfortunately, he returned and suddenly died. The whole country mourned together, sighing and lamenting. Yesterday, my old friend Mr. Huang told me some random notes after Mr. Liang's death. I'm writing them down immediately.</p>
<p>Mr. Liang's death was due to cardiac paralysis. When he was dying, he had already lost consciousness. His breathing was erratic, and he suddenly died at 7:40 AM on the 8th inside the Manhai Garrison Headquarters. His groom, Lin, was attending to him and was the first to discover it. By nearly ten o'clock, the news spread throughout the city. The citizens cried out, "General Liang is dead!" They wept loudly, as if they had lost their parents. At that time, the sky was overcast, with a cold wind blowing. The coolness was piercing. Around 1 PM, there was a torrential downpour, as if the heavens were also shedding tears of sorrow. Alas.</p>
<p>Mr. Liang had a famous horse that he always rode. Since his death, the horse has been neighing sadly all day long, neither drinking nor eating. The horse seems to know and grieves for the loss of its master.</p>
<p>Mr. Liang was generous and righteous, always helping the poor and rescuing the distressed. Therefore, his subordinates wept and lamented upon hearing this tragic news. His groom, Lin, cried especially grievously and fainted three times. Mr. Liang's posthumous love was so touching. Alas.</p>
<p>When Mr. Liang was dying, he was wearing a woolen shirt, an undershirt, and a felt blanket. The quilt he was covered with was also only made of cotton. After his death, some people were sorting out his belongings and found a package on the side of the bed. It was wrapped in white paper, with the words "Souvenir" written in blood on it. Upon inspection, it was an eight-inch-long sharp blade. The discovery of this blade suggests that Mr. Liang used to appear on the battlefield, advancing and retreating in a hail of bullets. His bravery in annihilating the enemy cannot help but command our respect.</p>

<p>The evening was approaching. Mr. Rong Desheng, the garden's owner, along with Jinshi Qian Mingshan from Wujin, and the couple Gu Qiaoruo and Zhang Jinyun, all happened to be in the garden. They entered the banquet together, and during the banquet, they spoke at length about the suffering that the press and the industry have endured in recent years. Everyone sighed in unison. As the banquet came to an end, it was almost the first drumbeat of the night. The guests all stayed in the garden, while the rest of us returned to the city. The next day, the garden's owner hired the Yang's painting boat to take the guests to tour the lake quickly. He pre-arranged for me and Tiao Fu to wait in the city. After the Tang and Yu couple and Qiaoruo and others boarded the boat, they would sail to the Yuanzhu to wait. Jiezi and the guests went directly to the Meiyuan because Meiyuan is only separated from Yuanzhu by a body of water, so the guests could wander around early. As soon as the boat arrived, they would have a meal. Then they drove to the newly developed Liyuan by Mr. Wang. The time was not wasted, and the tour was leisurely. Unexpectedly, when we arrived at Yuanzhu, it was almost noon. We searched all over the Flying Cloud Pavilion, Guangfu Temple, and Xiaohangu, but there was no trace of the guests. We met Mr. Chen Siming and Mr. Yang Rongchun at Hengyun Villa. They inquired that the guests had not arrived. So they decided to wait on the boat. Mengdie showed Qiaoruo the Acacia Bean Poem of He Jiezi. I also corrected the Sea Tang Poem Under the Moon with the same seat. I learned that Mr. Tang Moubo was also good at chanting. I asked for a five-character poem about his trip to Ganlu Temple. I was surprised to see that it was well received. Ms. Qingtang even asked her two young sons to recite Tang poetry and sing for fun. Their voices were loud and clear, skilled and rhythmic, which shows that the Tang family has a deep foundation in learning. (Moubo is the eldest son of Mr. Weizhi) It is appropriate to have such a Ningxin. Yu Jun is a great educator. His usual training is very effective. Soon a phone call came saying that the guests were all waiting for the ferry at Wanqingtang. Tiao Fu drove a steamship to greet them. After a while, a leaf-like boat came flying through the waves. They were all happy to have waited for a long time. They discussed entering the table first. Half drunk, Ms. Huanfen led the tour of Yuanzhu. Back on the boat, they enjoyed the rest of their feast. The boat went straight to Liyuan. Liyuan is located in the shade of Wuhu, facing the water and facing the mountains. The scenery is secluded and beautiful. Mengdie and I described its twists and turns as elegant, like the writing of Zhenchuan. The momentum of Yuanzhu is relatively strong, which can be compared to Yuju. Meiyuan is beautiful and complete, which is the poem of Yuxisheng. After the tour, they returned to Meiyuan for a short rest. Jiezi set up a banquet at Taihu Hotel to continue the unfinished joy. We returned to the city. It was late at night. The next morning, Tang and Yu invited them to lunch, and they also arranged to visit the People's College and Wangxiang Experimental Area run by Yu Jun. I was mistaken by the messenger and did not participate in the visit. It is a pity. However, according to the oral description of Mr. Zhuping, the old women in Wangxiang can read. Even the poorest families can pay attention to cleanliness. The merit of Yu's education can be verified by these two points. Zhang returned to Shanghai that afternoon. Before leaving, he earnestly talked about the relationship between the industry and the press. He had especially great insights into the plan to develop the scenic spots of Wuxi. This trip of Zhang will be a benefit to Xiyi, not just sightseeing. This is the record.</p>
<h3 id="e214">A Record of the Noise in New York <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Jin</p>
<p>A guest returned from the New World, saying that the streets around Broadway in New York were bustling and bustling, especially in the commercial and industrial areas. The whirring of cars and the rattling of factories were earth-shattering and incessant day and night. Those who enter it are invariably affected by this major sound wave and gradually become deaf. Moreover, the majority of these were laborers. According to a report this spring by Mr. Gan Erte, chairman of the New York Noise Prevention Committee, noise has a significant impact on the human body's blood circulation, heart beating, and brain movement. According to a recent survey of laborers, car drivers, boilermakers, and machinists in the city who suffer from noise-induced hearing loss, there are 83,000 people, accounting for about 73 percent. Among them, the number of people suffering from noise-induced hearing loss in the four years from 1925 to 1929 was more than half as many. If this continues, not only will these people's ears be completely deaf, but, as mentioned above, it will also greatly hinder their physical and mental development.</p>
<p>It is impossible to make machinery silent because of deafness. As for cars, the timing of their sounds may be slightly restricted, but it is ultimately dangerous and inconvenient for pedestrians. According to people in the meeting, there are no less than a thousand factories in New York City. The smoke is heavy, and there are often flying debris that penetrate the eardrum and accumulate and block it for a long time, which is enough to form deafness. This is especially obvious. The council is now paying very close attention to various factories for the sake of preventing noise. It is expected that there will be major changes in special characteristics in ten years. Otherwise, New York will become a deaf city in the world.</p>
<p>▲ Short Message: Since Bai Longshan Ren assumed the position of principal of Changming Art School, he has been going to the school every Wednesday to explain painting techniques and revise students' homework. This week, he went to Ning because of something, so he went to make up the class on Friday. After the class, he passed by the Western painting classroom and saw that there were various facilities for displaying still life and animal life writing. He took a Western painting pen and Western painting paint and did still life painting on the Western painting cardboard on the easel. It was his first time trying the pen, although he was not proficient, the color and brushwork were still very flavorful. The students of the whole school craned their necks and watched from afar, all of them dancing with joy. This is truly an unprecedented fun writing for the old man's life and a grand event in the Shanghai art world.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Random Notes from Shenyang <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Tingkai</p>
<p>I went to Dalian in early spring. I admired the name of Shenyang and made a small trip there. I have a few trivial things to write down.</p>
<p>There are many sugar fruit and tea food shops in the provincial capital. As far as the eye can see, there are a total of thirty-one Daoxiangcun stores. I remember that the Daoxiangcun stores in Shanghai and Jiangzhe inland are also not insignificant. Most of them are operated by Suzhou merchants, and they are crowned with the words "Gusu Daoxiangcun". However, Shenyang is just the opposite. Only two or three stores are crowned with the word "Gusu". Although they are also operated by people from the south, most of them are from Shaoxing instead of Suzhou. Therefore, in the future, people with good taste outside the customs will gradually know the ancient Yue but not Jin Chan. And the words "Gusu Daoxiangcun" that we often see in our eyes, will they gradually be changed to "Ancient Yue Daoxiangcun"?</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Miss Li Cibei, who traveled with us, suffered from seasickness and vomiting. Besides Mr. Chen, she had no other Chinese to look after her. Mr. Chen was very worried because as the boat sailed west of Singapore, there were fewer and fewer Chinese on board, and it would still take twenty-eight days to reach Marseille, France. Mr. Chen and I both disembarked in Singapore. We felt a bit like leaving Yangguan Pass without a single friend. Mr. Chen is a Christian and is enthusiastic about everything. He gives money and effort in every way possible. Everyone who travels with him benefits from his help, and he is especially considerate in looking after Miss Li, which is very rare. Li is also a Christian. The two often teased me about Buddhism. I acknowledged it and argued with them, saying, "Today's Buddhists are mostly lazy, Indianized types. Compared to the clean, diligent, and courageous Christians, they have benefited much more from Jesus's sacrifice. However, Buddhism should evolve and work with the common people. Getting rid of its corruption and laziness would be beneficial, as its strengths are still significant. Who can say that Buddhists will ultimately be useless? Only those who sit around eating and claiming to be teachers of gods and men are burdens on society." Thus, the fate of idols and monks representing Buddhism is coming to an end, and a scientific, popularized Buddhism will rise in its place.</p>
<p>During our conversation, Mr. Chen suddenly said, "What you say is true. I have been in Burma for a long time and know that the trend of Buddhism in Burma has also changed greatly in recent years." I asked, "How so?" He said, "There are two Burmese monks named Uya. One of them is fluent in English and French and has repeatedly campaigned for independence, resulting in several imprisonments. I heard he has now fled to China and will go to Russia. Another monk, also named Uya, is currently resisting the British government. He went on a hunger strike in prison for sixty-seven days to arouse the sympathy of the Burmese people and died in prison. Hundreds of thousands of Burmese people held a large memorial march. Even Gandhi from India sent people to participate in the meeting and jointly resist," he said. I replied, "You see, Buddhists are not entirely passive, and Indianization is not entirely passive. Looking at the one death and one escape of these two monks, it seems there is still something that can be done."</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the ship issued an order for everyone to practice with lifebuoys. This involved hanging four pieces of light wood in a hemp bag around the neck, roughly like the ammunition pouches carried by soldiers. All passengers of third class and above had to practice, men, women, old, and young, lining up for roll call. Instructors provided training. Smaller ones were used for children, and women with babies hung them around the babies' necks. However, there is an important maritime rule that must be followed. In an emergency, men are not allowed to rush to disembark first. The captain has the authority to use a handgun to direct women to disembark first to escape. If a man mistakenly tries to go first, he will be shot with a handgun. This is the maritime rule. This point also reflects Kunhua's doctrine, valuing gentleness over strength, preferring to sacrifice the strong to protect the gentle, embodying humanitarianism. I have two feelings about this. The Sixth Patriarch said to the Fifth Patriarch, "Get on the boat, and I will ferry you across." The Sixth Patriarch took the oar and said, "When confused, the teacher ferries us across. When enlightened, we ferry ourselves across." Now, in the lifebuoy, only self-ferrying is possible. Only those who can ferry themselves can ferry others. If you don't have the strength to support yourself, you can't rely on other forces at this time. Another feeling is that passengers of third class and above have lifebuoys, while passengers in steerage below have no lifebuoys. The value of life is truly determined by money. Isn't that a great injustice?</p>

<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>▲Modern Theater Decoration (Middle)</p>
<p>The decoration of twentieth-century theaters has reached a point where it must change direction. The main reason for this change is that the theater has gradually lost its non-personalized stage setting nature and become a collective character, incorporating the writer, the actors, and the audience.</p>
<p>This is to create an environment, an atmosphere. Without this, the drama cannot leave a lasting impression. On stage, as on the screen, action and rhythm should find a precise and structured position in this atmosphere.</p>
<p>Therefore, the decorator's job is to constantly make the decoration a consistent harmony, avoiding poverty and dryness, to eliminate the audience's antipathy.</p>
<p>When listening to a classical drama, such as Esther, decoration is of little concern and can almost be ignored. This is because, according to the conventions of classical drama, the audience stands outside the performing events. He listens, watches, and comments, without any action. This is written dialogue literature, which is expressed more clearly by the stage scenery, plus a little decoration and costume "explanation."</p>
<p>Modern drama is no longer like this. The script, actors, and director should be integrated and completely closely matched to create a strong atmosphere and focus the audience's attention, and to make the audience forget themselves and be in the situation of the characters in the play, especially to create a collective movement, so that the audience cannot but be one of them. To achieve this goal, the script and actors are important, but the decoration must be one step further. In other words, decoration is especially important.</p>
<p>This tendency is not only true in drama. The same movement occurs in all arts. The author of a novel does not tell a story to the reader, but makes the reader feel that he is the protagonist. The painter unfolds his picture in front of the audience, not saying, "This is nature. I copied it down for you," but saying, "Look how strange and beautiful this nature is..."</p>
<p>Therefore, today's drama no longer just mixes "action," "words," "scenery," and "decoration" equally, but tends to unity so that people are no longer satisfied with reading a script, but must listen, see, and confirm, that is, to make the audience also live in it. These elements were previously hostile, and few people ever intended to unify them. The power of these elements is born with other forces. This so-called "other force" is not easy to determine, but it plays a huge role in your unconsciousness. Then what is this "other force" and where does it come from?</p>
<p>Is it from the actors? That's rare. Today we have few people like Sarah Bernhardt, Duse, or Mounet-Sully.</p>
<p>Is it from the author? No, it's the decorator. If it is the work of O'Neill, Toller, or Lenormand, then the decoration is only a by-product of the work. The decorator can only follow step by step. There are also Shakespeare and Molière's plays, which can be performed in front of dark walls without feeling the need for decoration. But if the script is not obvious, then it completely depends on the decoration. It can be said that nine-tenths of it is the decorator's business. He can make the abilities of the author and actors more prominent.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Finance: A Glimmer of Light in the Silver Market <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>▲Silver Receipts Particularly Heavy Due to Approaching Settlement Day</p>
<p>▲Sales of Jiangnan Small Silver Coins Still Thriving</p>
<p>▲Market Overview: The current market sentiment regarding silver is that clearinghouse transactions are still sluggish, with new transactions being very selective and cautious, in addition to the routine transactions of long-standing accounts. However, today's receipts are particularly heavy due to the upcoming settlement day. As the use of silver coins is gradually expanding, the market has become more active, and there are signs of a turnaround. A glimmer of hope for prosperity has appeared before our eyes.</p>
<p>▲Clearinghouse Rates: "Foreign Silver" is viewed favorably, adding color to the market. The morning rate was 7.205 cents, the same as the previous afternoon, but it briefly reached over 1 cent during the midday session. The closing rate was 7.2075 cents, an improvement of 0.25 cents from the morning. "Silver Clearing" remained at just over 0.02 cents in both the morning and afternoon sessions, but the situation was slightly better, with overnight rates reaching 0.03 or 0.04 cents, which is much better than during the period of white clearing. The demand also seems to be increasing compared to the past, and it is expected to improve further in the future.</p>
<p>▲Subsidiary Coin Market: Jiangnan small silver coins are still in high demand from merchants. Another 30,000 to 40,000 coins were purchased yesterday, causing the market to soar. The morning rate was 6.20 cents, and the afternoon rate rose sharply by 1 cent to 6.30 cents. 3,000 coins were transacted in the morning and 11,000 coins in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver coins remained flat, with the morning rate at 5.9775 cents and the afternoon rate at 5.97825 cents, the same as the previous day. 120,500 coins were transacted in the morning and 90,000 coins in the afternoon. Copper coins remained unchanged at 394,500 cash.</p>
<p>▲Silver Coin Inflow and Outflow: "Silver Funds" were not particularly heavy in receipts yesterday due to the mid-month settlement day, but receipts at money shops and public firms were unusually strong. Yesterday's receipts exceeded 47 million, with overnight funds also at over 6 million, and receipts of remittances from various sources at over 1.7 million. Cash receipts were over 1 million. On the banking side, receipts of bills from Chinese merchants were over 2.4 million, and receipts of bills from foreign merchants were over 1.67 million. Various goods, foreign exchange, taxes, and miscellaneous receipts were over 8.78 million, with special outflows of over 900,000. Telegraphic transfers were over 800,000. 1.2 million went into warehouses and 300,000 came out. Receipts of various funds at Japanese banks were 3.89 million, with 400,000 going into warehouses. "Foreign Funds" had bill transactions of 1.08 million in the morning and 925,000 in the afternoon. There were no banknote transactions in either session. Yuan new coins were transacted for 20,000 at the market rate plus 0.005 cents. Zhongshan new coins were transacted for over 100,000 at the market rate plus 0.375 cents. British silver dollars were transacted for 50,000 to 60,000 at the market rate plus 0.0423 cents. Off-market banknotes were transacted for 143,000 in the morning and 74,000 in the afternoon. New coins were transacted for 60,000 in the morning and 20,000 in the afternoon. Current silver dollars were transacted for 85,000 in the morning and 127,000 in the afternoon. Bank transactions were 450,000 in the morning and 600,000 in the afternoon. Foreign bank transactions were 300,000 to 400,000. Exchanges between bank foreign currency accounts were over 3.1 million, with banknote inflows and outflows over 2 million. Receipts at money shops were over 8 million, with overnight funds over 3 million and foreign currency loans over 1.5 million. Small money shops exchanged banknotes, selling forward foreign currency, current silver dollars, new coins, Yuan coins, British silver dollars, etc., for a total of 600,000 to 700,000, including 300,000 for Hankou, 100,000 British silver dollars for Hong Kong, 300,000 new coins, and 500,000 current silver dollars for the northern route.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Tea and Cocoon Seasons' Fund Requirements <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>▲Tea Season: As mid-spring approaches, the new tea is about to enter the market. Harvesting has already begun in the production areas. Tea firms and merchants in Shanghai have already set off. It is said that the tea harvest this year is quite good, but financial adjustments are difficult, which is a drawback. Over the past two days, Shanghai tea warehouses and tea merchants have been borrowing money or buying foreign currency from silver shops and money shops, creating a very crowded situation. As a result, the lending side has been somewhat flexible, reducing the amount. Generally, those who had 30,000 to 40,000 in previous years have only 10,000 to 20,000 this year. As for buying foreign currency, the profit this year is better than last year because the silver rate is stable. It is said that yesterday, silver shops and money shops shipped 700,000 current silver dollars to Guangzhou, 300,000 foreign banknotes to Hangzhou, and 200,000 current silver dollars to Fuzhou. The Jiangsu and Anhui regions will also depart in the coming days.</p>
<p>▲Cocoon Season: Transactions for funds needed to prepare for cocoon collection have been underway for the past few days at silver shops, money shops, and foreign silk firms, but the amounts are small, less than one-tenth of previous years. Fortunately, with the cocoon collection period not far off, and with the British merchants collecting cocoons, the foreign firms are doing their best to maintain the situation, obtaining large sums of silver from banks and distributing them to the cocoon collection merchants. Yesterday, it was heard that over 1 million was settled at an interest rate of 8.5 taels of Western interest, redeemable at any time, with no term limit. A small number of Chinese merchant banks with surplus cash also made over 600,000, but the interest rate was slightly higher, at 8 taels or 7.75 taels of Chinese interest. Most of the money shops were quiet, with only long-standing accounts making just over 1 million, but the conditions were very strict.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Busy Conclusion of Long-Term Loans Maturing Yesterday <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>The long-term loans released last year in the ninth and a half month of the lunar calendar, totaling 8 to 9 million (excluding deposits), with a six-percent interest rate, were due yesterday for repayment or rollover. However, due to the poor market conditions this year, the money shops were unwilling to roll over the loans, and most demanded repayment. Those unable to repay were inevitably stranded. Therefore, the shortage of silver this year in external sectors is unprecedented. According to surveys, over 4 million of these long-term loans were recovered by the financial community on this street yesterday, while only over 2 million were rolled over selectively for long-standing accounts. Ningbo money shops recovered nearly 2 million, with over 2 million rolled over. Because more loans were recovered this time, the cash handling procedures were very cumbersome.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Gold Market Suddenly Surges <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>▲Today's Swap Transactions Mostly Involve Bullish Positions</p>
<p>▲Heavy Swap Transactions to Cover Short Positions: Yesterday, the benchmark gold price exceeded 500 taels outside the customs, mainly because the demand for swap transactions exceeded supply, largely due to covering short positions. The foreign exchange market also benefited. Firms such as Yuan Mao Yong and Zhi Feng Yong purchased gold, while Tai Xing and Yuan Tai sold off slightly. The overall situation has not changed. The silver price rose slightly, and receipts were good, opening at a high. It then soared, and banks were actively absorbing cash. The near-term Japanese gold rate was estimated to settle at 1.05 taels, and the long-term rate at 1.045 taels. Therefore, by midday, the price reached around 501 taels. Later, firms such as Zhi Feng Yong and Sen Chang Yong competed to buy, while Heng Xing and others sold off, making exchange rates even more favorable, causing the price to rise by another tael, reaching about 502 taels.</p>
<p>▲Various Firms Rushed to Buy, Breaking the 500-Tael Barrier Before Noon: London silver bars remained the same as before, with the silver price up one-eighth. The May benchmark gold price opened up 6 qian at 499.2 taels. The gross price rose from 98.7 qian to 9.9 qian, and various firms rushed to buy. Exchange rates stabilized. The April British gold rate was 11 pence and 25 points for bank trading, and the June Japanese gold rate was 1.04125 taels. The shilling exchange rate remained unchanged. At 99.56 qian, it then stabilized, fluctuating by only 0.01 to 0.02 qian. Internal exchange rates seemed firm. Maihang and Mitsubishi traded April Citibank at 47.125 yuan. Shanghai and Zhengjin traded British gold at 11 pence and 25 points. Sumitomo offered June Japanese gold at 1.043125 taels, and Taiwan offered 1.04375 taels. After 10:00 AM, the price broke through the 500-tael barrier. Banks also broadly purchased spot goods, leaving few silver bars on the table. By 11:30 AM, the price had reached 501 taels. At this time, the Sino-Japanese Bank traded May British gold at 11 pence and 25 points, while long-term gold was offered for sale at 11 pence 375 to 4375 points. Yuan Mao Yong and Zhi Feng Yong both purchased silver bars. However, after just over ten minutes, the price fell by 4 to 5 qian. At the noon closing, the price was 500.006 taels. The posted price was still 500.88 taels, with a hidden difference of 8 to 9 taels.</p>
<p>▲Price Jumped to 501.9 Taels Before Closing: The afternoon market opened at 500.007 qian. It was initially very stable, fluctuating by only 0.01 to 0.02 qian. At 3:00 PM, the price rose to 1.5 taels due to purchases by Nei Xing and Zhi Feng Yong, and Sumitomo absorbed June British gold at 11 pence and 375 points. It then fell slightly by 0.02 to 0.03 qian. After 3:30 PM, buyers became active, and colleagues colluded to trade British gold, with the July rate at 11 pence and 375 points, then 3125 points. Zhejiang offered Japanese gold at 1.0425 taels, causing the price to rise again by several qian. After 4:00 PM, the price jumped to 1.89 qian. The closing price was 501.8 qian, an increase of 3.2 qian compared to yesterday. The highest price of the day was 501.9 qian, and the lowest price was 498.7 qian, a difference of 3.2 qian. The posted price had a hidden difference of 7 taels. The bookkeeping charge was 1 tael. The morning water charge was 1 tael, and the afternoon charge was 2 taels. Goods opened at 99.1 qian in the morning and closed at 500.0075 in the afternoon, up 0.8 qian in the afternoon, with a closing price of 2 taels. Today (the 16th) marks the start of June trading, so the market will open early at 8:30 AM, and swap transactions are expected to involve bullish positions of over 1 tael.</p>
<p>▲Most Small Traders Have Covered Both Long and Short Positions: Yesterday, interbank trading was still not substantial. Firms such as Yuan Mao Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Yu Yong, Yu Da, Fu Xing Yong, Ju Chang, and short sellers all made purchases. Shunli and Wan Xing had occasional transactions. Yuan Da, Tai Xing, and arbitrage firms sold off. In the afternoon, Heng Xing, Da De Cheng, and Wan Xing sold, while Yuan Mao Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Tai, Yuan Xing Yong, Yuan Cheng Yong, Shunli, and Sen Chang Yong generally purchased. Most small traders have covered both long and short positions. Dalian banks currently have only a few thousand silver bars, selling over 1,000 and buying 1,000. Guangdong banks slightly reduced their long positions.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Foreign Exchange Shows Resilience <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>▲Chinese Merchants Do Not Have Large Demands</p>
<p>Yesterday the British silver market did not move. The American silver market rose slightly and market conditions were quiet. HSBC's foreign exchange rates remained unchanged. Overseas telegraphic transfers increased by 0.1875, to 54.4375 rupees. Yokohama and Kobe markets declined slightly, and market conditions were uncertain. Domestic bank exchange rates in this city were generally resilient, but they were stable early in the morning. They then rose as the gold price gradually increased. In the afternoon, they became even more prosperous. The benchmark gold price, driven by swap transactions, has exceeded the 500-tael mark. Chinese merchant speculators do not have large demands, with slightly purchasing 30,000 to 40,000 pounds. Sumitomo, East Asia, and MacKay Lee sold. Occasionally, 20,000 to 30,000 pounds were sold, which were absorbed by Mitsubishi and Sumitomo. Banks traded 40,000 to 50,000 pounds with each other and hedged over 100,000 yuan in Citibank, while only 100,000 yuan were settled. Mitsui sold some and purchased tens of thousands of yuan in Japanese exchange. Banks like Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Zhejiang, Industrial, and Taiwan sold, while Dalian banks sold several tens of thousands of yuan in current Dalian exchange, which were purchased by Mitsubishi and Korea. By the close of the market, the rate was better than the previous day, with the shilling down 0.0125, the US dollar down 0.03125, and the Japanese exchange up 0.005.</p>
<p>▲East Exchange: Domestic exchange rates had a difference of 0.005 throughout the day. Chinese merchants purchased slightly. In the morning, April was offered at 1.04625 taels and bought at 0.0045. June was offered at 0.004 and bought at 0.003875. July was offered at 0.00275 and bought at 0.003625. At noon, April was offered at 1.05 taels and bought at 0.004875. June was offered at 0.0045 and bought at 0.004375. July was offered at 0.00425 and bought at 0.004125. At the close of the afternoon market, April was offered at 1.05125 taels and bought at 0.005. June was offered at 0.004625 and bought at 0.0045. July was offered at 0.004375 and bought at 0.00425. The difference between near and far-term rates was very large, about 0.00625 to 0.0075.</p>
<h3 id="e223">London Bar Prices Stable, Exchange Rates Slight <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's London telegram, London bar prices remained unchanged, with near and far-term prices the same at 19.5625 pence (equivalent to 1 shilling and 11.125 pence in British gold). Ground conditions were unchanged, with few transactions and a flat market. A New York telegram stated that the US silver price rose by 0.0125, to 4.2625 US dollars. The British dollar against the US dollar fell by 0.000625, and the US dollar against the British dollar fell by 0.0003125, to 4.8634375 US dollars.

<p>Yesterday, spot government bonds were traded sparsely, with only a few tens of thousands of yuan transacted. The futures market was active, with transactions of over 860,000 yuan, the most of which was customs duties. Whole 6, Continued 25, and Reorganization were also over 1 million. Others were quiet. As for the price changes of various bonds, Continued 25, Continued Reorganization, and Reorganization bonds rose by three to four cents, with a stable trend. The seven-year customs duties also rose by about eight cents, but the fluctuations were also peaceful. Suddenly rumors circulated in the Whole 6 market that lottery drawings would be held, and buyers were very enthusiastic, and the demand was very disparate, and the price rose rapidly in Shanghai. The magnitude of the rise was the most seen in recent months. The price in the four-month period soared by three and a half yuan compared to the previous day, and the price in the five-month period also rose by two yuan and eight cents. Investment buyers in the market also favored the Retrenchment and Rehabilitation bonds, and their prices also rose sharply, with Retrenchment rising by about two yuan and Rehabilitation rising by one yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e226">Yarn Flowers: Current Sales Stagnant in the Yarn Market <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm and trending very soft. A certain factory intends to maintain its position this month, and will increase purchases when the price reaches the 52 tael mark, so the market is relatively stable. As for the sluggish current sales, it is due to many rumors about the current situation, resulting in stagnant sales to customers. In addition, the overseas cotton yarn market is uniformly trending downwards. Due to these various reasons, the overall market is very weak. Therefore, although buyers are currently holding firm and not selling, a major drop and change may not be far off.</p>
<p>▲ Futures Yarn Fluctuates: Pre-market opening before bidding, due to the downward trend in the overseas cotton yarn market, morale was dampened. Near-month contracts fell by 4-5 qian, and far-month contracts fell by 3 qian. The number one contract for this month purchased 300 bales, and prices suddenly surged by 5-6 qian. In the end, near-month contracts rose by 2 qian, and far-month contracts rose by 1-2 qian. The number 34 contract exclusively sold 2,250 bales. In the afternoon, it was reported that actual sales were quiet, and number three yarn fell sharply by 3 yuan. However, the market for scattered retail purchases was still stable, with near-month contracts rising by 3 qian and far-month contracts rising by 1.3 qian. This month, the number 34 contract sold another 850 bales. The total daily transaction volume was 12,700 bales. The closing prices for the human bids are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Month　Closing Price　Increase/Decrease　Account Balance　Closing Price　Increase/Decrease　Account Balance</p>
<p>April 152.5　Up 0.05　38,000　July 152.2　Up 0.12　49,000</p>
<p>May 151.8　Up 0.01　40,300　August 152.8　Up 0.03　19,500</p>
<p>June 152.0　Up 0.003　31,100　September 153.2　Up 0.00　7,300</p>
<p>▲ Yarn Sales Quiet: Current yarn sales are flat. Throughout the day, buyers from various groups purchased 800 bales, and peers purchased 30 bales. The market price for daily yarn fell by 2.5 qian. Among the customer groups, the Zhongchuan group was the most active, purchasing 280 bales. In addition, the Guangdong group purchased 100 bales, Jiangxi purchased 25 bales, inland areas purchased 120 bales, Tianjin purchased 60 bales, Wuhu purchased 20 bales, Niuzhuang purchased 30 bales, Xuzhou purchased 25 bales, Xiamen purchased 30 bales, and other groups purchased 65 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Cotton Market Remains Lifeless <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market initially fell and then rose, but the overall situation is weak. Japanese merchants continue to purchase this month without easing up. Han merchants are also tightening and holding firm. Therefore, although the price of American cotton is falling sharply, the domestic cotton market sentiment is still good. In short, the bottom stock is weak, and new sellers do not dare to short excessively. However, if foreign cotton continues to fall, there is no reason for domestic cotton to rise independently.</p>
<p>▲ Han Biao Mostly Small Liquidations: The Han Biao cotton futures exchange opened with American cotton trending downwards, and scattered retail investors sold off in a panic, with prices falling by 0.05 to 0.02 taels across all months. In the afternoon, those who profited bought back to cover their positions, and the market situation strengthened slightly, rebounding by 0.05 to 0.015 taels. The total daily transaction volume was 33,800 dan. The closing prices for the Han Biao are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Han Biao Closing Price Increase/Decrease Account Balance 6.3525 Down 0.05 72,600</p>
<p>April 3.3570 Down 0.10 56,400 July 3.3530 Up 0.05 66,300</p>
<p>May 3.3530 - 81,300 August 3.3525 Down 0.05 52,400</p>
<p>▲ Demand for Current Cotton Remains Low: Transactions in the current cotton market are flat. The offices of various factories are very slack. The sources received 600 bales of Yao flowers and 820 bales of Tong flowers. The sales prices are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Huoji Flower 35.50 Dong Cotton Company purchased 1,500 bales. Currently being delivered to factories for processing.</p>

<p>▲ Rainfall in US Cotton Drought Areas: Yesterday, US cotton prices were weak due to a lack of major buyers, poor news from Liverpool, and rainfall in drought areas. Futures fell by 17-25 points, spot prices fell by 20 points. British cotton futures fell by 5-7 points, spot prices fell by 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 5 points.

<h3 id="e229">Grain: Hexia Rice Market Sales Turn Smooth and Stable <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>▲ White Geng Slightly Tight... Xian Rice in Short Supply, Firm</p>
<p>▲ Zhabei: Yesterday, fewer than ten rice boats arrived at the port from various routes. Accumulated stock in Hexia decreased. Sales of white geng rice from the northern group turned smooth, and store appetites were also keen. Therefore, the price of middle-grade geng rice was stable and beautiful, while top and middle-grade rice was slightly tight. Transactions between the two parties were extremely active. Sales of thin rice were mediocre, and prices did not rise or fall. Yang xian dazi jian market was firm, and foreign rice was also reporting good sales. Retail sales were booming. Unfortunately, there was a shortage of goods, and demand exceeded supply. Top yang xian needed to be priced above 19 yuan. Customer port jian rice was extinct in Hexia, and sources were also scarce, hence the silence. White yuan arrivals and sales were even, and the situation remained stable.</p>
<p>▲ Hunei: Arrivals were not strong, and the market in this street was flat. The reason for this is that there are only middle-grade goods here, and high-grade materials are scarce. Therefore, buyers focus on high-grade goods and reject middle-grade goods. As a result, Changxi machine geng rice has good sales, and the overall market is stable. Although the price of Sutong machine geng rice is stable, transactions are still rare. In addition, the sellers were eager to sell, making the market even more lifeless. Imports of thin rice from the southern group were extremely rare, and sales were still smooth because customer groups showed some interest, and prices rose slightly. Transactions of ordinary bian yuan were sparse. Arrivals from inland areas were scarce, and early sales were also dull yesterday. The market situation remained the same as before. Arrivals of yang du jian were increasingly thin, and retail customers showed some interest, so prices were tight.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Foreign Rice Rises Again by 0.1-0.2 Yuan <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Wuxi and Nanjing groups were tirelessly active in foreign rice, and prices continued to jump. Spot prices rose by approximately 0.1 yuan, route goods rose by 0.15-0.2 yuan, and futures prices rose by 0.05-0.09 yuan. In addition to the Xining and Nanjing groups, various groups in Zhejiang Province and the Suchang area of this street also had offtake. Route goods were more cost-effective than spot goods, and importers were even more greedy, so the rise was also better. The overall market opened for sale 3,000 bags of Saigon rice, with number one priced at 15.55 yuan, number two at 15.15 yuan, Xiaojiao 4,000 bags, priced at 14.95 yuan, Mindang 2,000 bags, priced at 15.10-14.95 yuan. Also, 500 bags of brown rice, priced at 14.43 yuan, Qialami 1,000 bags, priced at 14.52 yuan. Route goods were mainly Xiaojiao, with a total of 6,000-7,000 bags open for sale, priced at 14.90-14.75 yuan. Futures were around 2,000 tons, also mostly Dajiao and Xiaojiao.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Flour and Wheat Market Shifts with the Weather <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>▲ Foreign Wheat Reports Lower Prices, Flour Market Falls Back: Yesterday, the flour market fell back due to lower foreign wheat prices, by as much as 1.5-1.6 yuan. In addition, the weather had cleared up, so near-term and long-term sentiment was greatly shaken. The lowest price for this month reached 2.525 yuan, 2.5075 yuan for May, and 2.3525 yuan for June, a fall of approximately 0.02 yuan compared to the previous day's highest price. July, August, and September each fell by 0.01 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, sentiment rebounded slightly because the weather had become cloudy again. April, May, and June had ups and downs of around 0.01 yuan. However, although the weather was not good afterwards, it did not rain, so the market sentiment softened again. Current actual sales are not rising, so there should not be an excessive rebound. Long-term contracts shift with the weather, and inland groups have always been bullish, so it is difficult to fall sharply in the short term. As a result, this month fell by 0.015 yuan compared to the previous day, May and June fell by 0.0125 yuan, and July, August, and September each fell by 0.01 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ June Futures Wheat Continues to Fall by 0.06 Yuan: Yesterday, futures wheat fell sharply across all months. From the buyer's perspective, the current market shifts entirely with the weather. When the weather is bad, they compete to absorb it, and when it is clear, they sell off in large quantities. These ups and downs are erratic, with no predictable pattern. As for this month, because factories have changed their attitude, there may not be many deliveries for this month, so it is gradually weakening. For long-term contracts, inland groups are selling heavily, and the fall is also sharp. As a result, this month fell by another 0.02 yuan compared to the previous day, June fell sharply by 0.06 yuan, July fell by 0.02 yuan, August fell by 0.03 yuan, and September fell by 0.04 yuan. The spot wheat market is also trending flat and weak. Since flour sales are not very good, the warehouses of various factories are in a state of indifference. High-grade goods are shouting for a reduction of 0.03-0.04 yuan, and middle-grade goods have not opened yet. Suzhou wheat is priced at 5.112 yuan, and Qingjiangpu wheat is priced at 5.112 yuan, totaling 2,000 bags.</p>

<p>▲ Spot Market Hit Hard</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received news from the production area that the current price of Cuban spot sugar was still 1.875, and the price of New York sugar futures in May was 1.60, a drop of 0.03 yuan compared to the previous telegram; September was 1.72, and December was 1.8, each down 0.01 yuan; March of next year fell by 0.02 yuan, with a price of 1.87. Both Java futures and spot sugar did not rise or fall. In the public association market, the Dutch sugar 24 coarse granulated white market was still quiet, with a transaction price of 7.1775 yuan. Demand was not high. Although there was no rise or fall compared to the previous day, the market shape was relatively flat and weak. Medium granulated white sugar was even less inquired about. Japanese sugar imports and exports were also quiet, and the market remained the same as before. However, with the new factory delivering goods in April and May, the ET and ER marks were priced at 6.5 taels, with new regulations adding taxes, the price was still cheap, so the current spot market suddenly turned weak. It was heard that the intentions of the factory plate's counterparty were not strong, saying that only 6,000 bags were opened.</p>

<p>▲ Kelp: Customer sales are stagnant, and it is difficult to move inventory. In addition, new goods are about to enter the market, so companies holding goods are mostly willing to cut prices to sell them off, leading the market to trend weakly. Currently, vendors are peddling Nemuro kelp for 6.4 taels, Hamachūgoku and Atkeshi kelp for 6.2 taels, Snake Skin kelp for 5.7 taels, and Chief kelp for 5.5 taels, but few are receiving buyers.</p>
<p>▲ Dried Scallops: According to a telegram from the production area, the market has been raised due to the active purchases of the Nanyang group. The Shanghai market has a shortage of sources and thin bottom stocks, so prices are gradually rising. Yesterday, the market opened with a price of 145 taels for medium-sized grains and 120 taels for broken grains. Merchants have a strong appetite for purchases and have sold more than ten boxes in total.</p>

<p>At the beginning of last week, the European and American foreign exchange markets were relatively stable, and various foreign firms began to purchase silk futures, and the market trended smoothly. However, by the weekend, changes gradually occurred in the silk exchange. In the past two days, European and American exchange rates suddenly lengthened and shortened, causing foreign firm silk sales to be greatly affected. Although foreign silk telegrams were transferred to Shanghai yesterday morning, Chinese merchants claimed that there was a shortage of dried cocoons and thin silk stocks, and those holding excess goods were hoping to sell at high prices. European firms, due to the unstable exchange rate, did not dare to lower prices to purchase. Yesterday, only Lianji purchased 40 bales of white factory warp, Bidu and others purchased 20 bales of Sichuan yellow factory warp, and Kechang purchased 10 bales of Jiayu edge silk. Prices are reportedly firm.</p>

<h3 id="e236">Ford Motor's Style Change · Ding · Zu · Ze <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>▲ Stainless Steel Replaces Nickel Plating</p>
<p>▲ Radiator Changed to a Narrow and Long Style</p>
<p>▲ Adoption of Small Wheels and Large Tires</p>
<p>▲ Body Style Made More Beautiful</p>
<p>Ford Motor, in order to maintain its position of low prices and massive production, does not change its style as frequently as other cars. For example, the Model T Ford continued its style for more than ten years until it was changed to the Model A in 1928. The Model A has been in production for two years now, and there are now plans for another change, which have already been implemented and are already on sale in the United States. However, there is still no news of this new car being shipped to China.</p>
<p>This time, the change in Ford's car is not in the actual mechanical parts. Only slight improvements have been made to the appearance of the body. Therefore, companies that manage Ford Motor in various regions will not be affected by unsold vehicles, except for customers who tend to be trendy.</p>
<p>The most notable feature of the 1930 new Ford Motor is the use of stainless steel to replace the nickel-plated parts. According to the decorative beauty of the car body, the first requirement is a refined style, and the second requirement is brilliant color. The paint used by each car is now Duco paint. There is no special new paint. The metal parts on the other car bodies have always used nickel plating. By 1928, many cars had changed to nickel plating. The color of cadmium is cyan-white, which is more radiant than nickel. However, the Model A Ford did not follow other cars and imitate it, but still used the old nickel plating. The public thought that Ford was too old-fashioned. In fact, with Ford's financial resources and manufacturing capabilities, although the value of cadmium is slightly more expensive than nickel, it is not impossible to use cadmium plating. Ford is quite revolutionary in manufacturing and does not want to follow in the footsteps of others. This time, it resolutely used stainless steel and abandoned nickel and cadmium plating, which is the first in the automotive manufacturing industry. In the future, other cars will definitely imitate Ford Motor's use of stainless steel.</p>
<p>New Ford Motor Six-Window Four-Door Sedan</p>
<p>Stainless steel is a kind of alloy, and its color is like white tin. Neither humidity nor acidity can make it rust. Its quality is firm but not brittle, and it is ductile. It can be hammered into various styles. Its radiance is soft, not as irritating as chromium. Moreover, nickel plating and chromium plating only apply a thin layer of nickel or chromium to the metal. After many frictions, the applied nickel or chromium will disappear one day. Stainless steel does not have this drawback. According to the modern metallurgical industry, there is an alloy called stainless steel. Its properties are similar to stainless iron, but due to the difficulty of manufacturing and the high value, it is not noticed by the automotive manufacturing industry except for the manufacture of high-quality knives and forks. Ford Motor's use of stainless steel this time is said to be a new discovery of the factory. The manufacturing cost is not expensive, but the manufacturing method is extremely secret, so the outside world does not know its composition. Even in Dearborn, where the Ford factory is located, it is only known that the new term for this stainless steel is Allegheny Metal.</p>
<p>New Ford Motor's shiny parts of the car body, such as the radiator shell, the lampshade, and the wheel hub, are all made of stainless steel. The novelty of its color is a prominent feature in today's car team.</p>
<p>Secondly, the changed part of the Ford Motor is the radiator. Its style is narrower and longer than the old one, which adds a lot of beauty. The other is the use of small wheels and large tires. The current tire size is 29X4.75 inches. The style of the car body is that after the radiator is raised, the waistlines on both sides can be drawn into a straight line from the front of the car to the rear of the car. The length of the car body has not increased, but after the short line of the car neck, the inside of the car body is slightly wider than before.</p>
<p>In addition to the usual six styles of the new Ford Motor, namely two convertibles and four sedans, a new six-window sedan has been added.</p>

The capital of both companies is exceptionally strong, and almost all have branches everywhere. Now, a piece of good news tells us that these two major companies have actually merged. After this incident was spread, the gasoline market suddenly changed dramatically. The impact of the waves is bound to have a major impact. Therefore, without hesitating to use words, I will record the details of this merger and tell you, the readers.</p>
<p>Originally, the merger of Mobil and Vacuum had been brewing for a long time. After several months of negotiation, the board of directors of both parties decided on this issue. Speaking of the nature of these two companies, there is indeed a possibility of cooperation, because the products of the New York Mobil Line are mostly made of crude oil and refined into motor oil and kerosene. The Vacuum Company is a well-known producer of machine oil. Most of the lubricating oil used on machines everywhere is supplied by it. Mobil's business is mainly in the United States, while Vacuum's business is mainly overseas customers. These two differences further highlight the need for mutual support. These two major companies have a very long history and have established a very solid foundation overseas. Vacuum's branches are in Australia, Egypt, South, East and West Africa, and Europe. Mobil's power has not reached these places, but it has extremely large oil storage pools in the Far East, Near East, and India. In this way, once the two parties merge, their power can reach the entire globe.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>In the United States gasoline market, the merger of the two companies is especially meaningful, because the modern business trend is to focus on one company while supplying various products at the same time. In other words, everything from crude to fine and other products should be managed by one company. In this way, the products can obtain considerable economies and compete with the same industry. Originally, Mobil and Vacuum each had its own strengths and weaknesses. The short-sightedness is that Mobil is not good at engine oil and Vacuum lacks fine products. Now that the two companies are merged into one, these difficulties will naturally be solved. Mobil has a recent plan to use all its strength to develop motor oil, because its importance today is indisputable. Because of the development of automobiles, gasoline has also become an indispensable fuel. In the past, because it was restricted by other products, it was not able to concentrate its energy on seeking the great development of gasoline. Now, Vacuum is in charge of other products, and Mobil can naturally have no worries. At this moment, it is planning an internal reorganization and paying attention to the national advertising plan.</p>
<p>What will be the situation after the merger? First, the new company's power will reach 9% of the national oil consumption, and it can be equal in strength to the rest of its major competitors. The situation abroad is similar. After the merger agreement was concluded, the government was also requested to file a record. The government sent it to the court for review. After the two companies were allowed to merge, they were renamed General Petroleum Corp. General Petroleum can have all the assets of the two companies. The company will issue new shares separately. All old shares of Vacuum can be exchanged for three new shares. Mobil shares will be exchanged for new shares at the same price. The board of directors will be re-elected, but the number of people from both companies must be equal. Among the assets, goodwill is the most valuable item. Other trademarks are also very impressive. The so-called goodwill is the company's reputation, which can also be said to be the brand. This kind of thing is empty and nothing, but it happens to be the most valuable. This is common in the United States.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the merger of the two major companies in the United States can have a lot of influence. As far as the company itself is concerned, the two sides support each other and adjust each other. It is extremely powerful to resist external competition. In the gasoline market, all colleagues naturally feel a great threat after hearing the news of the merger, because they can clearly see that a strong enemy has come again. As for users, they may be able to obtain many conveniences as a result. The more intense the competition in the same industry, the better the prices will be. Even if the price is not cheap, at least the service must be satisfactory. Therefore, from the standpoint of our users, we absolutely express our 12-minute approval of the merger of the two companies.</p>

<h3 id="e242">Scenic Spots Along the Xiutun Road · Zhuo <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>The Wutun Motor Road is under construction. It began in the spring of last year. Jixi, Shexian, and Xiuning are carrying out construction in separate sections. From Jixi to Shexian, there are over a hundred li. The roadbed has been completed. From Shexian to Tunxi, there are fifty li, and the roadbed has also been completed. Later, due to the disturbances caused by Bao Gang's defeated soldiers in southern Anhui and the lack of funds, it was not possible to open the road to traffic. However, the section from Tunxi eastward to Xiuning City, which is thirty li, was opened to traffic last month. Business is very prosperous, with four round trips each day, which is quite convenient. It is recently heard that the section from Tunxi eastward to Caoshi, which is fifteen Chinese li, will also be opened to traffic soon. It is expected to become even more convenient. It is said that Tunxi is an important town in southern Anhui and the center of the old six counties. Its commercial prosperity is no less than that of Wuhu. Last year, it was ravaged by the bandit Zhu Laowu, and the entire town was reduced to ashes. According to the investigation by the Tunxi Post-Disaster Relief Committee, the losses were estimated at no less than twenty or thirty million yuan. However, since the disaster, reconstruction has been underway in an orderly manner. It was not expected that it would take a hundred years to recover. In the recent period, it has already become quite impressive. Therefore, the ancient sites and scenic spots along the Tunxi-Xiuning Motor Road are briefly recorded as follows: (1) About five li from Tunxi, it is the first station from Xiu to Tun. The place is called Longfu, which is the hometown of Dai Dongyuan, who assisted in compiling the Siku Quanshu during the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty. The site where Dai Dongyuan studied still exists. Some time ago, Huang Renzhi of Shanghai inspected education in various provinces and visited Longfu, inscribing the six characters "Dai Dongyuan Reading Place" on the lintel of the former site, which is extremely elegant. On the opposite bank is Taoli Garden, which covers over a thousand mu and produces peaches and plums with an annual value of several hundred thousand yuan. (2) About fifteen li from Tunxi, there is a town called Qianfu. Mr. Shi Hongyu, a Qing Dynasty scholar of Confucian classics, once lectured here. The opposite bank is Yashan Mountain, covered with green trees. Visitors who come here feel refreshed and relaxed. (3) About twenty li from Tunxi, there is Wansui Mountain, which is located on a cliff above a large river and is also known as Ancient City Rock. The mountain is full of rugged rocks. According to legend, it was where Zhu Taizu (the Hongwu Emperor) took refuge. Therefore, there is still a stone tablet with the three characters "Wansui Shan" standing majestically on the cliff overlooking the large river. It is also called Lianxin Stone. According to legend, Mr. Jin Zhengxi of the late Ming Dynasty would come here every morning. His feet would extend three-tenths of an inch outward to practice his mind. Some say that Jin Zhengxi's refusal to surrender to the Qing army was largely due to this practice. At the foot of the cliff, there are pavilions and towers, which are extremely exquisite. Since the Republic of China, it has been opened as a park. People sip tea there endlessly. To the east of the rock, there is a large stone bridge, which is over a hundred zhang long. The fourth station of the Xiutun Road is located here. (4) Five li outside the east gate of Xiuning City, which is twenty-five li from Tunxi, there is a town called Wan'an, which is the fifth station of the Xiutun Road. To the north is Xintang Village, where there is the Ginkgo Hall. Every beam and pillar of the hall is made of ginkgo wood. The current Anhui Second Middle School is built on the expansion of this hall. The town produces compasses, which are the best in the country. About 50% or 60% of the people are engaged in the compass industry.</p>
<p>▲Correction: In the article "Shandong Government Purchases 150 Long-Distance Buses" published in this journal on March 26, it was stated that the value was 300,000 yuan. It has now been verified that this is an error. This 300,000 yuan is the deposit paid for the first batch of 50 vehicles upon delivery and not the price for 150 vehicles. To avoid misunderstanding, we hereby solemnly declare a correction.</p>

<h3 id="e247">Letters <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Reply to Mr. Wu Yinsheng's letter of April 12th</p>
<p>(1) Sir, according to the newspaper report yesterday, Mr. Wu Yinsheng is seeking a method to treat constipation. According to my teacher, Mr. Xie Liheng, people only know that constipation is a disease of the intestines and often use laxatives. Over time, the intestines become tired and ineffective. They do not know that this disease can be caused by the lungs not circulating qi, the stomach not descending qi, or the liver being congested with heat. It is appropriate to open the lungs, descend the stomach, or clear the liver. All of these can effectively relieve constipation. The so-called treatment of "separating two or three" in Chinese medicine is not like the Western medicine treatment of symptoms. Your condition includes dizziness, bad breath, and a yellow tongue coating, which indicates that stomach heat is steaming upward and cannot be cleared and descended. It is appropriate to use whole Trichosanthes fruit, immature bitter orange, Coptis chinensis, Pinellia ternata, and bamboo shavings. One or two doses can relieve constipation, and several more doses can reduce bad breath and yellow tongue coating. When the taste is right, the stomach heat will be removed, and the stool will naturally be lubricated. In addition, frequent walking can invigorate the peristaltic movement of the intestines, so that constipation will not occur often. Teacher Xie has served as president of various Chinese medicine schools and resides in Ningkang Lane on North Zhejiang Road. He has a long-standing reputation for treating diseases. You may wish to go and study with him. Sincerely, Wang Linfang.</p>
<p>(2) In reply, during my spare time from medical practice, I happened to read your letter in the newspaper describing your illness and suffering. As a doctor with a heart to save the world, I cannot but take it as my responsibility. I will now share my experience with you. The novelist Qin Shouou had constant constipation and pimples on his face. When he asked me for treatment, I said that it was due to damp heat in the stomach, which steamed between the muscles. I prescribed 0.5 fen of rhubarb powder in hot water every morning. After a month, his bowel movements were regular, and the pimples disappeared. Your condition is similar, so why not try it? According to the Materia Medica, rhubarb is bitter and cold, clears heat, and has the function of promoting the new and removing the old. Westerners often eat it as a tonic, which is reasonable. If it is ineffective, then the disease is slightly different. It is necessary to examine the physique and pulse before prescribing the right medicine. Sincerely, Chinese medicine practitioner Xie Yenong (Clinic: Lane 2, De'an Lane, west of the General Chamber of Commerce).</p>
<p>(3) Constipation is related to lifestyle and diseases of the stomach and intestines. Now that you have tried all kinds of laxatives without success, it is likely that the root cause has not been removed and your lifestyle has not been improved. If you send this letter to Dr. Zhang Senyu's clinic at No. 9 Maodeli, Zhangjia Bang, Meibai Road, he can indicate everything. Clinic hours are from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM. I also enclose this information.</p>

<p>▲Luo Huizhu, a Cantonese prostitute from the Minxin Company, and Guo Jinhua, a former client, committed suicide by poison at the Dongya Hotel on March 24th due to their unsuccessful marriage plans, hoping to be united in the afterlife. Guo died immediately, and Luo passed away on the 7th of the month. It has been reported many times that Luo died for love. Before taking the poison, Luo was hired by the company to play the role of a famous prostitute in the film "Dreams of the Old Capital." A few days before taking the poison, she repeatedly urged the company to shoot the film first, claiming that she would be traveling far away. The company complied with her request because of her repeated urgings. Unexpectedly, the film was completed on March 24th, and the accident happened that evening. We must also fulfill our duties carefully in the present world. This is also (the image below is Luo's posthumous photo).</p>
