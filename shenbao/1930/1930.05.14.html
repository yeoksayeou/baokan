<p>檢察官論告朱檢察官遂起立略謂本案可分三部份說（一）高英部份高英本是舊金山副領事與廖氏是夫妻高廖氏從中國回到美國舊金山海關在他的箱内查出鴉片這箱上都有封條想係高英事前給與否則亦必出於僞造海關且拍有相片證明高廖氏以領事夫人運土到埠時高英且往碼頭迎接此中情形當然有連帶關係及海關將高廖氏行李扣留高英又即電伍公使乞援此種慌張情形很爲明顯但這種舉動在箱子未開之前箱内所藏毒物高英實巳先知此更足證明高英有帮助的行爲原判决處以徒刑七年並科罰金六千六百六十六元這是很對的不過這個判决照舊禁烟法判的現在新禁烟法巳經頒布舊法不復適用所以本部份應按新禁烟法第二條與第十四條之規定（？）攺判這是應行糾正的又關於期約賄賂部份他同陳以一本係相識在民國十七年陳高有信往來接洽華工赴美情事當由陳以一在國内招得梅光等四人並代辦護照放洋赴美並與高英約定在美接引事成之後有報酬三千元陳取四之一高取四之三其中大約高英嫌少所以後來陳以一又有信給他說可以加到二六照這情形看來如果高英事前没有同陳以一接洽一定不會如此的所以本部份原判並没有錯誤（二）高廖氏部份烟土是他帶的並且在他的行李内搜出二千二百九十九罐烟土又在他自巳箱内搜到陳生給孫垣的信和編號鑰匙信内詳說貨物的品質價值帶力（讀原函）這種證據都可以證明他們販土行爲的所以原判並無錯誤不過舊禁烟法巳不適用須同樣以新禁烟法裁判（三）孫垣部份孫垣原判無罪但在本案内他旣有深光温玉賢等給信與他託其如何如何照料（讀原信）他就不能說無關係照這信看來他同深光温玉賢是很熟悉的這一點看他原信很簡單没有客套辦妥後並要他打一回電等可以看出孫垣若和他們事前没有接洽則此項大宗烟土若被孫垣舉發或吞没又將如何呢所以孫垣同他們不認識這句話是不近情理的而且這件案子高廖氏是擔任輸的高英擔任封條孫垣擔任到埠後的照料他們三人差不多完全分工合作做這件事情的原判說他没有關係這是不對的請將原判撤銷照新禁烟法論罪（未完）</p>

<p>日本游泳前次在上海受辱之原因爲當時美國檀島舉行國際游泳大會日本將其精銳選手五六人盡派往該處參加不得巳而遣二等選手參加遠東會故遭慘敗但本屆大會日本確有勝利希望因各優選手在大會前决不出洋留國内以待菲島强敵前次上海大會菲利濱游泳健將島爾加氏其五十米自式之紀錄爲二十七秒二成爲大會紀錄之保持者現日本之高石勝男君竟打破該項紀錄創造二十秒八之好成績至於二百米平泳菲利濱之成績亦較日本略遜一籌其比較如下</p>

<p>日本鶴田義行二分四五秒</p>
<p>照上紀錄日本較强於菲該紀錄爲去年萬國竸技大會（在阿姆司締魯達麻地方舉行）中菲日比賽之成績預料菲方必備本屆大會之機會而雪去年之恥將來两國接戰定各不相讓其他如四百米自由及千五百米自由日菲之成績相等唯菲軍達比耳氏之百米背泳可怕但二百接力日本頗有把握本屆日本之游泳委員及選手名單如次</p>

<p>（阮蔚村攝）</p>
<p>各選手係選自東京及關西两方其合宿練習之進行頗猛烈現據一般之推測日本雖不敵我國但無論如何仍有亞軍之然望每屆大會中菲因比賽足球輒發生爭執糾紛七屆馬尼拉大會中菲起口解八屆上海大會菲方表示不滿本屆大會仍難免紛擾日人决施容觀主義趁機而努力戰爭飽期擊敗中華强敵</p>

<h3>中華網球表演</h3>
<p>邱飛海林寳華二對一獲勝卡塔</p>
<p>李蓮花李杏花零對二敗於星克</p>
<p>牡丹花昨未出席</p>
<p>失敗原因在沙地</p>
<p>吾國出席遠東會之網球選手林寳華與邱飛海二人昨約上海網球雙打冠軍卡那凡洛塔佛爾斯在中華綱球塲表演以資練習準備赴日比賽同時並有西人青年會女子雙打决賽亦在該塲舉行與賽者爲吾國李杏花李蓮花對費爾斯與克勞福結果邱林以六比三七比五四比六六比三勝卡塔而女子决賽吾國李氏姊妹以○比六二比六失敗詳述經過情形如下</p>
<h3>（一）邱飛海林寳華二對一勝</h3>
<p>下午四時邱林與卡塔開始比賽林邱二人各有專長林之發球邱之穩靜俱爲二人之得意傑作對手爲上海網球雙打大哼去年連執草地賽硬地賽及羅伯杯三錦標惟今年因網球季方開始尙未得操練機會故昨日表演未臻妙境即如日前西青網球賽中二人竟敗於卜脫與鄭兆佳之手亦出人意料昨日邱林之勝未見劇烈林邱如能吃緊工作當不難造成「直落三」之結果也</p>
<p>開始對抗林邱先發制人連勝三局聲勢浩大卡塔起而奮攻相戰數十回合得勝一局旋又五勝一局吾國林寳華發球連續四記對手未能還出一記遂以「滑四」之數造成五與二之比數頗見功夫卡塔加上一局後林邱以六比三勝第一盤第二盤中競爭較烈最初形勢與首盤類同惟卡塔占於優先曾以三比零比一四比二五比二領前大有攫取該盤之勢而林邱二人抖起精神一鼓而下以七比五反敗爲勝取得第二盤此盤中短兵相接極見功夫博得五六百觀衆之掌聲不少</p>
<p>第三盤中林寳華頗爲懶惰失分甚多局數自二比二後卡塔一躍居先精神飽滿吃緊工作以六比四奪回盤第四盤邱林一路順風以六比四勝當第五局中林之抽球得心應手猛烈非凡而塔佛爾斯招架有方對戰良久邱飛海觸出冷門打中對方要害全場讚美不置結果林邱以六比三勝</p>
<p>李連花李蓮花二對零敗</p>
<p>此賽旣畢西人青年會女子雙打開始决賽第一盤中李氏姊妹一籌莫展連負六局第二盤當至四比零時（費與克占先）两李忽有特殊表演連下两局頗得好譽但卒以對方來勢兇猛難挽狂瀾結果費爾斯與克勞福又以六比二勝觀杏花與蓮花之表演缺少活潑精神因沙地油滑不敢奔跑此爲失敗之最大原因聞李氏四姊妹襄在爪哇時係練慣水門汀球場故不覺滑今攺用洲地殊感不便太有行不得也哥哥之憾而致成績減色未能一顯好手殊覺遣憾耳</p>
<h3>中華男排球賽</h3>
<p>昨以二對零勝混合隊</p>
<p>中國排球選手隊昨日又約上海混合隊在田徑塲比賽混合隊者仍以復旦爲基本缺一曹廷贊（因曹在選手隊中）外加三五人實力未見加增足以競爭形勢相差懸殊乃一面倒之局勢缺少精彩可言結果選手隊以念一比二念一比六連勝两局</p>

<h3>安慶停靠外輪</h3>
<p>中國航高反對</p>
<p>長江爲中國内河唯一航路尤爲英日各洋商所重視近年太古怡和·日清·等對於此綫添船增埠銳间意擴張競爭不遺餘力中國輪船最近两年以内因受内戰影響在長江營業僅不絶如縷直至現在方漸復業但武漢以上來貨仍甚缺乏當此華江輪復班聲中洋商江輪忽有在素不准設立班聲之内地口岸可以停靠此事關係國權與商運至巨滬地華航商巳提出反對茲將原因分誌如下</p>
<p>外輪謀安慶設埠照天津條約長江航路如安慶·大通·沙市·等埠洋商輪船均不許設立輪埠靠泊因上列各地並非開放之通商口岸也但滬上英日各江輪在皖南之蕪湖巳各有碼頭而於皖北之安慶以格於限制祇得於船舶經過時抛泊江面船上之貨客等用民船駁運之查安慶一埠僅華商招商·三北·築有碼頭故該埠之營業上較之外輪爲佳但英日各航商冀圖闢置碼頭之念未嘗須臾或忘至今乘皖當局設施新建設計劃之時便乘機取得安慶靠停碼頭之權而達到目的云</p>
<p>皖省允洋船停靠皖省省政府爲設施交通新計劃在安慶口岸特添造一極大之輪船碼頭用意在使利無碼頭之商船靠停旣可發展皖北之商運事業而省庫亦可增一筆收入故名曰公共碼頭各洋商得訊便向省府進行磋商各外輪之在該埠靠停辦法皖省府巳經提議通過准用該碼頭名義招外輪停泊並咨請外部備案刻下外部之復文巳到亦經批准遂激起華航商之大反對</p>
<p>華航商表示反對首先表示反對者爲安慶之中國各航商其理由以安慶向不准外輪靠碼頭若許其靠泊不特喪失國權且使不絶如縷之中國航業將受洋商輪之侵奪排斥並電請上海華輪業起而援助茲聞本埠各華輪公司對於此案亦表示堅决的反對巳在具呈國府及交通部等請速令皖當局撤消准許外輪停埠之案以維國權而保華商營業矣</p>

<h3>一得之言秋水</h3>
<p>當一個男子愛上了一個女子的時候他决不會和伊吵嘴可是當一個女子不願再和他爭辯的時候伊的愛情就死了</p>
<p>和一個男子結了婚以後有這樣的好處就是你的男朋友可以常常到你家裏來吃飯談天而無所用其忌憚和諱避了</p>
<p>耶穌敎徒的冀求是想到羅馬去瞻仰一回聖跡青年男子的冀求是要在處女的香唇上得一甜吻</p>
<p>假使一個妻子看作「深閨伴夜」是丈夫的義務時那末他必以此爲苦而不以爲樂了</p>
<p>熱漲冷縮｜春天的氣候把男子們的心開放了至少可以容納着一打的女人　　未結婚以前男子把他的心和靈魂放在伊的足邊可是結婚以後妻子的足邊却充的足邊他的煩惱</p>
<p>戀愛和暈船病有一樣的情形當第一次的痛苦巳經消失了以後一個女子很容易的又乘上了情潮洶湧中的海船而去重嘗那暈船的痛苦哩</p>
<p>可以與之結婚的男子像西瓜一樣到處可以尋到他的蹤跡可是未吃以前却非把他剖開而破壞之不可</p>
<p>假使你和你妻在路上走有到了自由神像你千萬不要多看否則你的妻子將疑心你不忠於伊而心懷異志哩</p>

<h3>Italy's Position in Europe</h3>
<p>Since the end of the European War, is Italy the one who replaced Germany and desires to dominate Europe? Italy has somewhat succeeded in one-party rule internally, and then expanded abroad. Looking at all its international actions, none is not aimed at France, and the most obvious example is striving for equality with France at the naval conference. Since the European War, Germany has been defeated and France has won. The one who holds the reins in Europe is implicitly in the hands of France. Now Italy wants to keep pace with France in every aspect. This is the first step in the process of dominating Europe.</p>
<p>European nations are the most competitive nations, so those in between only have room to advance and no room to linger. If the country cannot revitalize internally, it will not have the desire for external development. If the country has achievements internally, it will be eager to try to compete for length and contend for supremacy. This is why Europe has so many powerful countries. The reason for repeated rise and fall is also here. Strong people cannot achieve glory without aggressive advancement, but aggressive advancement cannot avoid people's suspicion. In the future, the general trend of Europe may be to treat Italy as they did Germany before.</p>

<h3>The 58th Special Session of the Japanese Diet Ends</h3>
<p>The Closing Ceremony Will Be Held Today; Seiyukai Members Will Make a Final Stand, Determined to Use All Their Strength to Impeach the Government</p>
<p>Nikkan Rengo News Agency, Tokyo, 13th – The House of Peers opened its session at 10:00 a.m. on the 13th, submitting supplementary budget proposals, a proposal to increase the national treasury's contribution to ethical education expenses, and a proposal for unemployment relief, all of which were approved without objection. With this, the government's proposals and all other items have been deliberated, and this special session of the Diet is now concluded. The closing ceremony will be held tomorrow.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 13th – On the final day of the Diet, this morning, members of the Minseito party entered the Diet early, intending to resolve all matters in a sweeping manner. The Seiyukai party's strategy is to focus all its efforts on impeaching the Prime Minister. After the motion for impeachment of former Minister of Education Kobashi, proposed by Ozaki, is put to a vote, the economic resolution will be on the agenda. Former Minister of Finance Mitsuchi will make a forceful speech, launching a full-scale attack and impeachment. Therefore, the explanation regarding the punishment of the accused will be simplified as much as possible. If the economic resolution can be brought forward urgently, or if the aim of the political resolution related to military reduction can be explained concurrently, it is unknown. At the time of the agenda setting, there will inevitably be the most intense debate.</p>
<h3>Informal Naval Negotiations Begin Between Britain, France, and Italy in Geneva</h3>
<p>French Political Circles Believe the Italian Prime Minister's Speech Hinders the Progress of Negotiations; German Foreign Minister Curtius Urges the Disarmament Conference to be Realized Soon</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Geneva, 12th – Today, British Foreign Secretary Henderson discussed the possibility of a Franco-Italian naval compromise with the Italian Foreign Minister at lunch, and the foreign ministers of the countries concerned also began exchanging views in informal talks. It is reported that French Foreign Minister Briand and Italian Foreign Minister Grandi may meet with Henderson tomorrow at his invitation. Recently, when journalists met with German Foreign Minister Curtius, Curtius expressed his regret that the Disarmament Preparatory Committee meeting would be postponed until November. The German people unanimously support the government in demanding that disarmament negotiations be accelerated, as the success of this move would enhance the dignity of the League of Nations and silence the opposition.</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Paris, 12th – French political circles were shocked by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech in Legnano on Sunday, viewing it as an ominous sign for the Franco-Italian negotiations currently underway in Geneva. Although government officials have strongly asserted that Mussolini's words were merely a tactic to dispel public concerns, newspapers largely predict the failure of the negotiations. Even the liberal newspapers, which usually sympathize with Fascism, have denounced Mussolini as a troublemaker and warned the government not to lose its balance due to Italy's threats. According to reports, Mussolini's speech stated that although Fascism fundamentally opposes recklessness and adventure, if there are attempts to hinder the nation's independence and future, Fascist Italy will fiercely retaliate. This statement is nothing more than a hidden threat.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Opens</h3>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Geneva, 12th – The 59th session (i.e., the Council) of the League of Nations Administrative Council opened today. As usual, the session began with a closed-door meeting to discuss administrative issues of the League. The President, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marinković, welcomed the new Council members: German Foreign Minister Curtius, Japanese Ambassador to Belgium Nagai, and Persian Representative Ala. After the first public meeting was held, many journalists and people from various countries were present as observers. German Foreign Minister Curtius was the first to speak in French, reporting on the first item on the agenda: the Customs Truce Convention and the next League of Nations Economic Conference. He stated that the convention had been signed by 18 countries and hoped that countries that had not yet signed would join soon. He then proposed that all matters relating to the convention be handled by the Economic Conference, which could be convened by the chairman at his convenience. This was unanimously approved by the entire session. British Foreign Secretary Henderson also made a brief speech, strongly stating that Britain was eager for the progress of economic relations between European countries and hoped that countries outside Europe would also join as much as possible when the next Customs Truce negotiations were held. He then mentioned the cooperation between the League of Nations Charter and the Kellogg-Briand Pact (which will be discussed by the parliament in September), declaring that Britain was prepared to accept the proposal. According to outside reports, the British representative opposed the proposed amendments that were too far from the original text of the charter. Henderson's statement is somewhat surprising.</p>

Since the foundation was flawed from the beginning, the toxic effects have gradually spread to the infinite. The old and the new have clashed, and there is no sense of propriety. Grand Master Dayu, with compassion in his heart, ordered his disciples to establish the Bodhi Academy, comprehensively integrating the three studies and widely embracing the ten schools. The academy aims to explore the source of the universe, self, and others, exhaustively encompass the merits of perfection, and strive for the unity of understanding and practice, so that principles and affairs are mutually integrated. Without self and without contention, we seek truth from facts. Those who deeply believe in Mahayana, are alarmed by heterodoxies, exhaustively understand and transform, and attain great happiness, are willing to be guides and should study in this way. Article 1 of the Bodhi Academy's regulations states that the academy aims to freely study Buddhist philosophy and cultivate talent for spreading the Dharma. Article 2 states that any bhikkhu or layperson, aged thirty or older, with good health, upright conduct, and a great Mahayana heart, who passes the academy's examination, will be a member of the academy, tentatively set at 120 members. Article 3 states that all accommodation after members are admitted to the academy will be provided by the academy. Article 4 states that members can freely choose their courses of study without restrictions or divisions between schools. Article 5 states that the academy will invite virtuous teachers to give lectures on all definitive sutras and treatises of Mahayana Buddhism and various methods of practice, and members can consult at any time if they have any difficulties. Article 6 states that the academy will examine the courses of study of members who are deemed capable of spreading the Dharma and send them to various provinces at any time to undertake activities that benefit sentient beings. Article 7 states that members sent to various provinces will be paid a corresponding salary each month. Article 8 states that applicants who reside in Beiping should bring a four-inch photograph for the academy to examine, while those who reside elsewhere should mail a four-inch photograph and fill in their place of origin, age, occupation, and aspirations. The academy will mail the examination questions, and those who answer correctly will be notified separately. Article 9 states that applicants can apply and be examined at any time from the date of this advertisement. Preparatory Office: No. 27, Madaren Hutong, Dongsi, Beiping. Special B 2682</p>
<p>today appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in his capacity as the leader of the delegation to the London Naval Conference. He stated that although the conference failed to resolve all the difficult problems of Europe, it was a complete success for the United States, Britain, and Japan. All the resolutions made by the American delegation were unanimously agreed upon. The delegation did not receive any specific instructions from any party before going to London, but while in London, they received numerous private telegrams teaching them how to deal with the situation. Stimson predicted that France would eventually accept the provisions on the humanization of submarines in the naval convention. He also said that at one point, the opinions of Britain, France, and Italy on each other's naval policies differed greatly, causing the atmosphere to be tense and the conference on the verge of collapse. Thanks to the mediation of the American delegation, a breakdown was avoided.</p>

<h3>Hunan Army Launches a Large-Scale Suppression of Peng Dehuai</h3>
<p>He Jian Has Issued an Order to Transfer Five Regiments to Suppress; Special Martial Law Has Been in Effect in Changsha Since the 9th</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Peng Dehuai, Huang Gonglue, and others entered Hunan from Jiangxi, colluding with the communist bandits of Pingjiang and Liuyang to capture Pingjiang County, the gateway to Changyue. The provincial capital was shaken and the people's hearts were greatly disturbed. This matter is of great importance to the security of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. The subsequent developments will be described in detail as follows:</p>
<p>The Loss of Pingjiang: Pingjiang is only a hundred miles away from the provincial capital. In recent days, officials, gentry, and the general public of Pingjiang have fled to the provincial capital to escape the chaos. It is said that Peng's bandits had a total of four to five thousand guns, complete with machine guns and mortars. At the end of last month, they occupied the area of Changchun and Xianzhong, and on the 5th, they launched a large-scale attack. On the morning of the 6th, they approached the county seat. At that time, the defenders of the city included Yu Xianli, the regimental commander of the 15th Division directly under He Jian, the first, fifth, and sixth brigades of the Changsha County Household Regiment, and more than 800 members of the Pingjiang County Household Regiment, who went out to fight. Regimental Commander Yu personally supervised the battle in the south of the city, and machine guns and mortars were deployed in the northwest and other cities to guard the key points. Initially, Regimental Commander Yu's troops repelled the bandits in the south of the city by several miles. However, due to the continuous firing of machine guns for more than six or seven hours without stopping, five of them were destroyed. Peng's bandits were able to charge in through the Xiaoxi Gate. The army and the regiment fought the bandits in the city until 5:00 p.m. The government troops suffered too many casualties, and the number of bandits increased, making it impossible to fight any longer. They abandoned Pingjiang City and fled through the gate. Regimental Commander Yu led the remnants to retreat to Wukou. The New Changsha County Regiment retreated to Jinjing and Maqiao. The whereabouts of the Pingjiang County Regiment are unknown. In this battle, the Sixth Brigade also suffered two-thirds of its casualties, while the Fifth Brigade did not suffer many losses and has retreated to Jinjing. As for the Pingjiang County Regiment, the extent of the casualties is unknown because its whereabouts are unknown. This also shows the intensity of the battle. As for Peng's bandits, there were more than 2,000 deaths. The fierceness of the battle was unprecedented in the previous battles between government troops and bandits.</p>
<p>Three-Pronged Suppression by the Hunan Army: He Jian attached great importance to the bandits' strength. In recent days, he has been busy dispatching troops and generals. Wang Yingzhao's regiment from Hengzhou and Chen Cexun's regiment from Nanhua have arrived in Changsha one after another and will be divided into three routes to advance towards Pingjiang simultaneously on the 9th. The plan is as follows: (1) Appoint Tao Guang, commander of the newly formed 31st Division, as the commander of the suppression of bandits in eastern Hunan, commanding Wang Yingzhao's regiment directly under his command, as well as the brigades of Zhang Qixiong, Wang Dongyuan, Yan Zhongru, and others, Chen Cexun's regiment, and the household regiments of Changsha, Pingjiang, and Liuyang counties to suppress the communist bandits of Pingjiang and Liuyang. (2) Order Wang Yingzhao and Chen Cexun's regiments and the special service battalion of the Fourth Route Command to attack the front of Pingjiang along the Changping Avenue. (3) Order Brigade Commander Wang Dongyuan to lead Yang Zhenpu's regiment to attack Pingjiang from the west from Yuezhou. (4) Order Brigade Commander Yan Zhongru to supervise the two regiments of Wan Fangzhi and Wang Zhibin to attack Pingjiang from the south from Liuyang. (5) Telegraph Luo Lin, commander of the Hubei Division, to send troops to block Pingjiang from Tongcheng. Telegraph Chairman Lu of Jiangxi to transfer troops to block Pingjiang from Tongxiu. Tao Guang departed from the province at dawn on the 9th with the two regiments of Wang (Yingzhao) and Chen (Cexun) and was ordered to reach Pingjiang by the afternoon of the 10th. In total, Hunan Province has mobilized more than five regiments to advance in the suppression. The household regiments of Changping, Liuyang, and other counties and the blocking troops of Hubei and Jiangxi are not included. He Jian also offered a reward of 20,000 yuan to the first person to recover Pingjiang City.</p>
<p>Peng's Bandits Withdraw from Pingjiang: At 9:00 p.m. on the 9th, He Jian received a report from Regimental Commander Yu Xianli from Xinshi by military telephone. According to reports, Peng's bandits had automatically withdrawn from Pingjiang City from the North Gate in the early morning of the 9th. Their whereabouts are unknown. Some say they are going to attack Yuezhou, while others say they are going to disturb Tongcheng on the Hubei border. There are not many bandits left in the city. Grain, rice, cloth, and other items in the city have been looted and carried to Changshou and Xianzhong by carrying teams. It seems that they have no intention of holding the county seat for a long time. The county government has been burned down, and the burning, killing, and looting have been extremely cruel. At the same time, Brigade Commander Wang Dongyuan telegraphed from Yuezhou, also saying that Peng's bandits had abandoned the city. In short, Peng's bandits will not be able to hold Pingjiang for long. In the future, once the army approaches, they will still flee to the border areas of Hubei and Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Maintaining the Security of the Provincial Capital: Pingjiang is close to the provincial capital. After the loss of Pingjiang, the people of the provincial capital were alarmed. Later, He Jian urgently transferred Wang Yingzhao's regiment from Hengzhou and Chen Cexun's regiment from Nanhua to Changsha, and the people's hearts began to calm down slightly. Tian Yingtang's regiment from Changde will also arrive on the 10th to consolidate the defense of the province. Currently, the troops in the provincial capital include the two regiments of Hou Feipeng and Wang Xiany, more than 1,000 police officers from the Changsha Municipal Public Security Bureau, 400 members of the Changsha County Household Regiment, and 200 water police officers from the Water Police Headquarters. At 2:00 p.m. on the 9th, Wei Suzhong, the commander of the Changsha Provincial Garrison, convened a meeting of the heads of the army, police, and other agencies to discuss ways to maintain the security of the provincial capital. The following matters were resolved: (1) Special security will be in effect from the 9th, with patrols and inspections day and night. (2) The security of the provincial capital will be the responsibility of the two regiments of Hou (Feipeng) and Wang (Xianyi), the Changsha Municipal Police, the Changsha County Regiment, and the students of the military officer training school. The security of the waterways will be the responsibility of the Water Police Headquarters. (3) Temporary inspection stations will be set up on land at Xinhe, Changsha East Station, and Changsha North Station, and on the waterways at Laodao River, Huji Ferry, and Dongtun Ferry to prevent bandits from mixing into the provincial capital. (4) A major inspection will be conducted at all hotels and restaurants in the provincial capital. The tension in Changsha can be imagined from this.</p>
<p>Relief for Refugees Arriving in the Province: After the fall of Pingjiang City, male and female refugees, young and old, fled to the province. As of 5:00 p.m. on the 9th, there were more than 1,800 refugees. It is estimated that there were five to six thousand refugees who fled to Miluo. The Hunan Provincial Relief Association, in addition to sending personnel with 20,000 yuan to Miluo for relief, set up the First Shelter for Pingjiang Refugees at the Zhu Family Garden outside the North Gate and the Second Shelter for Pingjiang Refugees at Tanggong Temple. Each refugee arriving in the province was issued two silver dollars and four loaves of bread to temporarily maintain the situation, pending further arrangements for the aftermath. There were many male and female students among the refugees, and the situation was extremely pitiful.</p>
<p>Petition for the Return of Troops to Suppress Bandits: Because Peng Dehuai invaded Pingjiang and Liuyang, Hunan Province, which originally had only half a month, had its troops transferred to Guangxi, and the troops in the province were weak and insufficient for dispatch, which led to the fall of Pingjiang this time. Yesterday, the public legal groups jointly telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Jiang to request that the troops sent to Guilin be allowed to return to Hunan to suppress the bandits. The text read in part that Commander-in-Chief He was stationed in the three Xiang areas and worked hard to eliminate the communists, although there were occasional riots in the border areas, they had not yet spread to the hinterland. Since the expedition to Guilin, the elite troops have been stationed in the Quanzhou area, and the troops in the province are insufficient for dispatch. It is requested that the Hunan troops sent to Guilin be transferred back to suppress the bandits and that military pay and weapons be allocated to strengthen the strength, etc. (May 10th)</p>
<h3>High English Appeal Case Hearing Situation (Continued)</h3>
<p>(Question) Did Gao Liao Shi also send a telegram to Minister Wu on the seventh, signed by Gao Liao Chengqiu, saying he typed it himself? (Answer) No, I asked him to type it in his name. Not Liao Chengqiu, but Liao Chengsu. (Question) Bringing eleven items implies some friendship. If Chen Sheng is not your friend, why would he ask you to bring so many things? (Answer) We don't know either, it felt strange. (Question) Did they discuss it with you beforehand? (Answer) No, we didn't know him, so of course there was no discussion. (Question) Were you present when the boxes were opened on the eighth? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Was Gao Liao Shi also present? (Answer) No. (Question) Were all fourteen items opened together? (Answer) No, only eleven were opened first. They pried them open with an axe, not with a key. (Question) Was this type of can opened from the box? (The questioning officer shows a photo.) (Answer) Yes, but we didn't have any of that kind in our three items. (Question) Were several letters also found in Gao Liao Shi's box? (Answer) I'm not sure, because the customs didn't notify us when they opened our three boxes, they opened them themselves. (Question) (Question) A bunch of keys with numbers were also found in your wife's box, according to customs officers. (Answer) Because they didn't notify us when they opened our three boxes, we weren't there, so we don't know. (Question) Have you seen the written statement from customs officer Harris Smith? They are very precise and clear in their work, so it's unlikely to be false. (Answer) I saw Smith's statement, but if they found the keys, why did they still pry it open? Isn't that a contradiction? (Question) Was there a seal on the box? (Answer) I don't know, probably not a seal. (Question) Is this a kind of mark from the consulate? (Answer) No. (Question) Did you look carefully at the time? (Answer) I didn't look that closely at the time. (Question) This seal comes from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Question) No. (Question) You don't know the origin of the seal, so where did Chen Sheng get it from? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) Does the Ministry of Foreign Affairs put seals on items going abroad? (Answer) No. (Question) Does your luggage have to be inspected? (Answer) It may or may not be inspected, there's no certainty. (Question) Does the seal have the consulate's stamp? (Answer) No. (Question) Does the consulate have seals? (Answer) No. (Question) Customs inspector Harris Smith's statement says that a total of 2,299 cans of opium were found in the box. Is this number correct? (Answer) I'm not sure about that. Please investigate it clearly. (Question) Their customs statement lists that number and is signed by the customs officer, so it must be correct. Your wife didn't mention the things she was asked to bring on the luggage declaration form? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) Later, when this matter came to light, did Minister Wu entrust Gong Anqing with the investigation? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Here is Consul General Gong's reply (reading the original text), saying you did all sorts of wrong things. (Answer) Consul General Gong's opinions differ from mine, which is common knowledge. Since he doesn't have good feelings towards me, he randomly said many bad things about me when he replied to Minister Wu. But this cannot be used as evidence. Please investigate it carefully, Your Honor. (Question) Gong Anqing also said that you had illegal activities a long time ago, but they were not discovered before. (Answer) Although Gong Anqing said that, since he doesn't have good feelings towards me, then what he said might not all be the truth. (Question) Have you ever done anything involving trafficking opium? (Answer) No. (Question) But Chen Yi said that consuls abroad, because their salaries are not high and the government doesn't pay them monthly, engage in such activities to maintain their livelihood, and you are just one of the discovered ones. (Answer) I don't understand these things. (Question) Chen Yi said that in addition to selling drugs, consuls also sell silk and people. (Answer) There's no such thing. (Question) Do you know Shou Nanshen, Guang Deng, etc.? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) According to you, you knew nothing about your wife transporting opium? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Didn't you ever hear your wife say that she was going to do such a thing this time? (Answer) Yes, she didn't say anything. (Question) Chen Yi forged passports to fraudulently obtain money, and he said that he had sent a letter to you beforehand to connect with you. Do you understand this situation? (Answer) This was last year's matter, I remember it very clearly. I felt that this matter was inappropriate, so I sent a telegram back to reject him. (Question) This was in April of the seventeenth year of the Republic. He repeatedly sent you letters saying that Mei Guang, Mei Han, and four others wanted to come to the United States, and he would handle their passports. He asked you to receive them in the United States, explaining that the reward was 400 yuan for each, later, because you probably didn't agree, he sent you another letter saying it could be increased to 26. This clearly shows that you had an agreement with him. (Answer) This is not an agreement between me and him. This is entirely Chen Yi's own idea. I originally felt that this matter was inappropriate and sent a telegram to reject him. This is evidenced by my telegram. However, because Chen Yi left Shanghai for Japan, he didn't receive my telegram. Therefore, these four people still set off for the United States. So, in reality, there was no agreement between me and Chen Yi. (Question) What did the immigration officials say when Mei Guang and the other four arrived in the United States? (Answer) They said that Mei Guang's passports were not valid and needed to be changed to be applicable. (Question) How did you handle it after hearing their words? (Answer) I saw that the passports were incorrect, which would reflect poorly on the nation's reputation, so I collected them on their behalf. (Question) Consul General Gong said in his reply to Minister Wu that you received Mei Guang and the other four and secretly discussed methods with Sun Yuan beforehand. Later, when the matter was not kept secret, you wanted to ask him to turn to the immigration bureau to find a way to explain it. These are all improper procedures. (Answer) There is no such situation. (Question) According to what you say, Gong Anqing's words are unreliable? (Answer) I fundamentally had no agreement regarding this matter. Of course, his words are unreliable.</p>
<p>Sun Yuan's Testimony (Official Question) You were originally found innocent in the first instance, but the prosecutor specifically filed an appeal because you have a significant relationship to this case. What do you do in San Francisco? (Answer) I work in the consulate as a clerk. (Question) How many years have you been there? (Answer) Seventeen years. (Question) Do you know a lot of people there? (Answer) Yes. Almost everyone in the Chinese community there knows me when they see me. (Question) Do you know Nan Ruoyun, etc.? (Answer) I don't know them, but they might know me. (Question) Do you work with Gao Ying? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Do you have any ill feelings towards him? (Answer) No. (Question) Do you have any particular good feelings towards him? (Answer) No. (Question) How is your relationship with Consul General Gong? (Answer) Just normal. (Question) Do you know about Gao Ying's wife returning to the United States from China this time? (Answer) I only knew after hearing Gao Ying mention it. (Question) Do you have many friends in the country? Did you communicate with them beforehand about this matter? (Answer) I do communicate with friends, but some of it is about things they asked me to investigate. We haven't talked about this matter. (Question) Did Gao Liao Shi send you a letter after returning to the country? (Answer) No. (Question) Did Gao Liao Shi arrive in San Francisco on July 5th? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Did you go to the dock with Gao Ying to pick him up? (Answer) No, we didn't go together. But the time difference wasn't big. I was ordered by Consul General Gong to pick up students, not to pick up Gao Liao Shi. (Question) Then did you see Gao Ying and Gao Liao Shi on the ship? (Answer) I saw them, but I left after one glance. (Question) Did you see the customs detaining the luggage? (Answer) I saw it. Gao Ying then asked me to go to the customs with him to negotiate and inquire about the reasons for the detention. (Question) What did the customs say? (Answer) They said that there were contraband items in the box. They had received reports from Hong Kong saying that there were drugs inside, so they had to detain it for inspection. (Question) Later, when were the boxes opened for inspection? (Answer) On the eighth. (Question) Were you present? (Answer) No. (Question) Do you know that there were 2,299 cans of opium paste in the box? (Answer) I didn't know it at the time, but I knew it later. (Question) Did Gao Ying and his wife go at the time? (Answer) I heard they went. (Question) Did you see that Gao Liao Shi's luggage had a seal? (Answer) On the fifth, I only saw a pile of square boxes on the dock, but I didn't look very carefully, so I didn't see any seals. (Question) Have you seen a seal from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? (Answer) I haven't seen it. (Question) Here are photos of the luggage, take a look. Are they the same as what you saw at the time? (Showing photos) (Answer) Yes, but I didn't pay much attention at the time, so I'm not very clear. (Question) How did you question the customs? (Answer) We questioned them about what reasons they had for detaining the luggage. (Question) Did you know about the letters that Gao Liao Shi brought to you beforehand? (Answer) I didn't know. (Question) You should have known after they were discovered? (Answer) Yes, but I don't know Shen Guang, Wen Yuxian, etc. (Question) Their letters to you are very clear (reading the original letter), saying the box numbers and serial numbers of the keys, and saying that two boxes should be given to Nan, and the rest to Ruoyun... Do you know these two, Nan and Ruoyun? (Answer) I don't know them. (Question) According to their letters, you should be good friends after this matter is settled, otherwise, according to normal circumstances, they shouldn't send you a letter. It is common to ask friends to bring things, but people you don't know would never dare to ask you. If you really don't know them, how could they trust you and not be afraid that you would ignore them or embezzle them? (Answer) They might know me, but I don't know them. (Question) Now that this matter has already been discovered, you don't know them? If the American customs didn't inspect, would these letters be delivered to you? Then, after you receive them, how would you handle these eleven items of luggage? (Answer) If that were the case, I would only return them or report them to the customs. (Question) According to what they say in the letter, it seems that you are not casual acquaintances. Otherwise, why would they ask you to send a telegram back? It can be seen that you have a deep friendship. (Answer) Are you sure you don't know them? (Answer) This is very strange. I really don't know what they mean. (Question) Has anyone ever asked you to do this kind of thing before? (Answer) No, I've only been asked to investigate things. (Question) Chen Yi</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>sent Mei Guang and the other four to the United States. Do you know about this? (Answer) Yes, when those four arrived in the United States, Consul General Gong asked me to go to the dock to investigate. (Question) Did Gao Ying discuss receiving them with you beforehand? (Answer) We didn't discuss it, but I heard him mention that he didn't agree to Chen Yi's request. (Question) Did Chen Yi say that there would be a reward for Gao Ying after this matter was completed? (Answer) Yes, there was, but Gao Ying didn't acknowledge him. (Question) Gong Anqing said in his reply to Minister Wu regarding this matter that Gao Ying tried to proceed secretly for this matter and personally contacted you (referring to Sun) at your residence. If you didn't have this kind of thing, why would he have said such a thing? (Answer) I don't know him.</p>
<p>At this point, the questioning officer asked Gao Ying and Gao Liao Shi to come to the front of the case and declared that the original appeal request (1) requested to investigate Chen Sheng, but now his address is unknown and there is no way to investigate (2) Consul General Gong has now retired, but has not yet returned to the country and cannot come to court for questioning (3) Shen Guang, Wen Yuxian, etc. Their addresses have been inquired at the Guangdong Bank. According to the reply, the bank does not have accounts of these two people, so there is no way to find out (4) Regarding the seal issue, it has also been repeatedly investigated, and recently a document has been transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for investigation. According to the reply, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not have such seals. No results have been found for the above four points. Today is the final hearing of this case. Do you have any other evidence to present? Gao Ying replied that there was no other evidence, but Gong Anqing retired last August and should have returned to the country to appear in court. He has bad feelings towards me and falsely accused me of various things. I want to understand the actual situation clearly, only by facing him in public court. Now he is late in returning to the country and appears to be avoiding it, so what he said is ultimately effective or ineffective? The questioning officer said that this matter will be dealt with when the verdict is made. No need to ask now. He also said that the hearing of this case has now been completed, please begin the arguments.</p>
<p>Prosecutor's Argument Prosecutor Zhu stood up and briefly said that this case can be divided into three parts: (1) Gao Ying's part. Gao Ying was originally the Deputy Consul in San Francisco, and Liao Shi is his wife. San Francisco customs found opium in Gao Liao Shi's box when she returned to the United States from China. These boxes all had seals, which must have been given by Gao Ying beforehand, otherwise it must have been forged. Customs also took photos as proof. Gao Liao Shi was transporting soil to the port as the wife of a consul, and Gao Ying even went to the dock to greet her. The situation obviously involves an associated relationship, and when Customs detained Gao Liao Shi's luggage, Gao Ying immediately telegraphed Minister Wu for help. This kind of panicked situation is very obvious, but this action shows that Gao Ying already knew about the poisonous substances hidden in the box before the box was opened. This further proves Gao Ying's aiding behavior. The original verdict sentenced him to seven years in prison and fined him 6,666 yuan. This is very correct. However, this verdict was based on the old prohibition law. The new prohibition law has now been promulgated, and the old law no longer applies. Therefore, this part should be re-sentenced according to Article 2 and Article 14 of the new prohibition law. This should be corrected. Also, regarding the bribery aspect, he and Chen Yi were originally acquaintances. In the 17th year of the Republic, Chen and Gao corresponded and negotiated the matter of Chinese laborers going to the United States. Chen Yi recruited Mei Guang and the other four in the country and handled their passports to go abroad, and agreed with Gao Ying to provide a reward of 3,000 yuan after they were received in the United States. Chen took one-fourth, and Gao took three-fourths. Among them, Gao Ying probably thought it was too little, so Chen Yi later sent him a letter saying it could be increased to two-six. Judging from this situation, if Gao Ying had not contacted Chen Yi beforehand, it would not have been like this. Therefore, there was no error in the original judgment for this part. (2) Gao Liao Shi's part. She brought the opium and 2,299 cans of opium soil were found in her luggage. Letters from Chen Sheng to Sun Yuan and numbered keys were also found in her own box. The letters detailed the quality and value of the goods and transporting power (reading the original letter). This evidence can prove their opium trafficking. Therefore, there was no error in the original judgment. However, since the old prohibition law no longer applies, it must also be judged according to the new prohibition law. (3) Sun Yuan's part. Sun Yuan was originally found not guilty, but in this case, he has letters from Shen Guang, Wen Yuxian, etc., asking him to take care of things. (Reading the original letter). He cannot say that he has no relationship. Judging from this letter, he is very familiar with Shen Guang and Wen Yuxian. From this, it can be seen that his original letter is very simple, without any pleasantries, and he also had to send back a telegram after the matter was completed. It can be seen that if Sun Yuan had not contacted them beforehand, what would happen if Sun Yuan reported or embezzled this large amount of opium? Therefore, the saying that Sun Yuan does not know them is unreasonable, and in this case, Gao Liao Shi is responsible for transporting it, Gao Ying is responsible for the seal, and Sun Yuan is responsible for taking care of it after arriving at the port. The three of them almost completely worked together to do this thing. The original judgment said that he had no relationship, which is incorrect. Please revoke the original judgment and convict him according to the new prohibition law (incomplete).</p>
<h3>The Russian Consulate in Harbin Plans to Establish a Legal Society</h3>
<p>The Special Zone Authorities Order a Ban</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence The Russian Consul in Harbin recently stated that in order to guide and assist the Russian people in Harbin with legal matters, he plans to set up a legal society outside the consulate. On April 22, he sent a letter to the Jilin Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Harbin, requesting that the letter be forwarded to the relevant authorities for approval. Since the consulates of various countries have never had such a precedent, Envoy Zhong refuted it with reason the previous day. Bao Wenjie, the Director of the Special Police Department, approved Envoy Zhong's letter yesterday and also instructed his subordinates to earnestly investigate and ban the original order as follows: "The letter from the Office of the Jilin Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Harbin stated that it had received a letter from the Russian Consul General in Harbin on April 22 of this year stating that the Consulate, in order to guide and assist the Russian people in Harbin with legal matters, has set up a legal society at No. 4, Building 7, Shangshi Street, Daoli, and has appointed lawyer Gransky as the director of the society. He should inform your Special Envoy and hope that your office will inform the relevant authorities of the establishment of the legal society by this Consulate. It has been found that the Russian Consul General plans to organize a legal society outside the Consulate. The consulates of various countries in Harbin have no such precedent. It is difficult to allow it. In addition to rejecting the application, a letter is hereby sent for your information and instructions to investigate and stop it, etc. Approved. According to this investigation, since the above-mentioned legal society has been rejected by the Special Envoy and is not allowed to be established, it should be investigated and banned to respect sovereignty. In addition to distributing the order to the branch, it is hereby ordered that the bureaus immediately investigate and determine whether there is the aforementioned legal society in the building number on Shangshi Street, and should immediately follow the Special Envoy's rejection of the establishment, and report it as necessary." (May 6)</p>

<p>Local Communications</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The case of the kidnapping at Tianma Mountain has been solved. Zhang Yuxing and Zhu Jiang, farmers in the forty-first district west of Tianma Mountain, were kidnapped by bandits on the night of the tenth day of the second month of the lunar calendar. Afterwards, their families received letters from the bandits demanding huge prices. Negotiations for reduction were repeatedly made, but no agreement was reached. On the eighth of this month, Zhu Jiang suddenly escaped from the bandit's lair. The location of his detention was Taiping Bridge in Nanhui County. After Zhu Jiang escaped, he was short of money and went to a Chen family there to borrow travel expenses. The Chen family head had previously served in the security regiment. After learning that he had escaped from the bandit's lair, he paid attention to reconnaissance and urged Zhu Jiang to report to the water police to ambush and arrest them. After Chen confirmed the location of the bandit's lair, the bandit leader, fearing that the news would be leaked after Zhu Jiang escaped, specially moved the location to avoid the pursuit of the military police. Chen saw a group of suspicious people and reported to the security regiment to intercept and arrest several bandits and one hostage (Zhang Yuxing). The local public security bureau heard the news and took them into custody. Just as the water police arrived, Yuxing first returned to Songjiang to report to the county government. However, the bandits captured in Nanhui are still held at the public security sub-station. It is rumored that the local security has been ordered to find the hostages. The county government here will prepare a document and ask the county government to consult.</p>

The office has approved the provisional trial. The Finance Bureau has ordered that a transfer office be established in accordance with the new regulations.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The cause of the youth's suicide In room 13 of the Xin Sutaiguan Hotel in Taoyuanfang, Yanmenwai, a traveler who claimed to be Wan Meiwen committed suicide by taking Ateling (a sedative drug) on the night of the eleventh. On the morning of the twelfth, he was discovered by the room attendant and sent to a nearby hospital for treatment. It is reported that a friend, Qiu Zaidian, is at No. 168 North Sichuan Road in Shanghai. The hotel sent someone to Shanghai to report. Qiu Zaidian and Wei Xudong went to Suzhou that night to go to the hospital to comfort him. Qiu and Wei explained that Wan Meiwen was actually Fan Lanting, 23 years old, who had been working as a runner at the Fengtai Printing House on Sichuan Road in Shanghai and had resigned. His father opened a Fan Caiji sofa shop across the street from the police station on Songshan Road in the French Concession. The reasons for Fan's suicide are no more than three points: (1) Because of economic reasons, his fiancee cannot get married. (2) Because of disagreement with his stepmother. (3) Business failure. After leaving Fengtai Printing House, he tried to start his own business but unexpectedly failed. Qiu and Wei returned to Shanghai yesterday (13th) to inform his father, Fan Ze, who is still in the hospital for treatment and is no longer in danger.</p>
<p>Sun Junxi's request for bail is denied.

The High Court examined and tried the case and sentenced him to five months in prison. Sun recently filed a petition with the High Court requesting bail. Yesterday (13th), the High Court ruled that Sun Junxi's sentence will end on June 17, so it rejected the request.</p>
<p>Teachers and staff in the city return their letters of appointment. Since all the teachers and staff in Suzhou resigned on the 1st of this month, they have repeatedly asked the principals' association for back pay, but it has not been resolved. The executive committee of the teachers and staff decided at a meeting the day before yesterday (12th) to return the letters of appointment from each school to show their determination, and decided to ask the principals for their back pay yesterday (13th). On the principals' side, they have also repeatedly urged the municipal government to pay the teachers and staff after they resigned. However, the municipal government has no funds to allocate, so it is scheduled to hold a general meeting yesterday (13th) to discuss and respond to the teachers and staff's back pay issues.</p>

They were ordered to be detained immediately, and a document was prepared to be sent to the county government for investigation.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Ling Xiying Requests Divorce; Court Hearing Record: Ling, daughter of a Mr. Ling, owner of Yong Chun He tea and confectionery shop in the pier street of this county, petitioned the county government for a divorce from her fiancé Cheng Zuxing and demanded 1,500 yuan in damages for loss of reputation. The case was heard by judges Shen and Cheng the other day. The defendant was absent. According to Ling Xiying's statement, she is 26 years old.</p>
<p>(Judge:) When did you get engaged to Cheng Zuxing?</p>
<p>(Ling:) February 27, year 17 [of the Republic, i.e., 1928].</p>
<p>(Judge:) Who was the matchmaker?</p>
<p>(Ling:) Mrs. Rui Xu.</p>
<p>(Judge:) How old were you when you got engaged?</p>
<p>(Ling:) Twenty-four years old.</p>
<p>(Judge:) How old is your fiancé now?</p>
<p>(Ling:) Twenty-five years old.</p>
<p>(Judge:) Why are you suing for divorce?</p>
<p>(Ling:) Because Cheng Zuxing intended to break off the engagement first without a legitimate reason, so I want him to compensate me for my loss of reputation.</p>
<p>(Judge:) I don't see any intention to break off the engagement in Zuxing's letter. Why are you dissatisfied with him?</p>
<p>(Ling:) In his letter, he mentioned that men and women have open social lives, that he has several girlfriends, and that I cannot interfere with his freedom to date. I repeatedly wrote to advise him, but he never listened, so I am suing for divorce. When he proposed to me, he came to my door in person. Later, we agreed that he wanted me to go to school. Because my family couldn't afford the tuition, they refused. Later, they came up with the tuition, so I went.</p>
<p>(Judge:) Which school are you studying at?</p>
<p>(Ling:) Shanghai Nanyang Girls' Middle School.</p>
<p>(Judge:) Did Cheng Zuxing come to propose alone?</p>
<p>(Ling:) I didn't know him. He suddenly came to propose. It was in late July of the 16th year of the Republic [1927] that he came to propose for the first time. He came several times after that and eventually tricked my parents into giving him my birth date. He came again on the 17th day of the first month [of the lunar calendar] in the 17th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1928], and we got engaged on February 27th. After the engagement, he wanted me to study. Because I had been away for so long, I didn't want to go back to school. He offered to subsidize my tuition to get me to go to school, so I reluctantly went.</p>
<p>At this point, the judge adjourned the court, saying that because the defendant was not present today, he would summon the defendant another day for further examination and then adjourned the court.</p>
<p>Mixing Counterfeit Bills Results in On-the-Spot Arrest: A few days ago, in Guanyintang Township, Qingpu County, two men, A and others, were mixing in counterfeit five-yuan bills from a certain bank in the market. More than a dozen merchants were deceived for a while. Yesterday, A and others went to Jin Fuxing Southern Goods store on Henan Street to purchase goods for about one yuan. A presented a five-yuan counterfeit bill for change, but the store owner discovered it and immediately sent them to the security corps. The next day, the security corps escorted them to the county government for severe punishment.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>County Courthouse Site Confirmed: The case of Wuxi preparing to establish a county courthouse has been ordered by the High Court to actively prepare. As for the office building, County Magistrate Sun plans to move the County Public Security Bureau to the old site of the current County Finance Bureau as the city preparation office will be abolished soon. The County Finance Bureau will be moved to the current city preparation office building, and the County Public Security Bureau's building will be allocated to the county courthouse for office use. He has already submitted the situation to the provincial government. Yesterday, he received an instruction that instead of transferring back and forth, which would not only be cumbersome but also delay important public affairs, it would be more straightforward to move the Public Security Bureau into the City God Temple, ordering it to be moved within a month so that the county courthouse can be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Quack Doctor Kills, Sternly Questioned: Shen Qiqing, the owner of Qian Yuan Tang Pharmacy outside the South Gate of Huangni Beng in this county, had a young son, Xizhen (9 years old), who recently caught a cold and had alternating chills and fever. He hired Qian Baohua from the Western District to treat him. Unexpectedly, Dr. Qian diagnosed meningitis and immediately extracted bone marrow for research. After extracting it for two consecutive days, the child died. Shen Qiqing was extremely saddened by the tragic death of his son and sent a letter to Dr. Qian yesterday, sternly questioning him and demanding that he explain within three days what basis he had for extracting bone marrow and what evidence he had to diagnose meningitis, or he would resolve the matter through legal channels.</p>
<p>Citizens Petition the Province, the Municipal Preparation Office Ordered to End: Citizens of the First District believed that the measure of closing the Municipal Preparation Office was not appropriate, so they sent representatives Yang Hanxi, Chen Zhanru, Cai Jian San, Zou Tongyi, Zhou Jimei, and others to Zhenjiang to petition the Civil Affairs and Construction Departments of the provincial government, requesting that the Municipal Preparation Office be transferred to the First District Office for management. After the petition representatives arrived in the province, they went to see Chairman Ye of the provincial government and stated their petition. Chairman Ye said that the transfer of the Municipal Preparation Office to the county's responsible departments for management was decided by the provincial government meeting and could not be changed casually. If there were concerns about the mixing of municipal and county funds, a Municipal Fund Property Management Committee could be organized to manage it. The representatives were satisfied and said goodbye. They then went to the Civil Affairs and Construction Departments to petition. The opinions of both Directors Hu and Sun were roughly the same as those of Chairman Ye. Afterwards, the representatives went to the Wuzhou Hotel to rest and held a meeting, deciding that after returning to Wuxi, they would work with County Magistrate Sun to organize the Wuxi Municipal Fund Property Management Committee, draft the articles of association, and submit them to the province for approval. They also sent a letter to County Magistrate Sun requesting that all affairs of the Municipal Preparation Office be temporarily suspended from handover until the Management Committee was organized and established. Yesterday, the representatives returned to Wuxi from the province by car to proceed.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>

Huang Changlin will be confronted with the plaintiff Gao Lanrong and others and detained together.</p>
<p>Provincial Reorganization Committee Decides on Three Points Regarding the Zhou Case: The County Reorganization Committee presented three points to the Provincial Reorganization Committee for discussing how to deal with the Zhou case: punishing the murderers, providing compensation, and confiscating the rebel property. The Provincial Reorganization Committee decided at its 35th meeting: (1) Send a letter urging the Jiangsu High Court to resolve the matter quickly; (2) The request to forward the case to the central government to order the judicial organs to comply with the three points is feasible and should be forwarded; (3) The re-establishment of the Zhou Case Review Committee should be decided by the Provincial Party Talk Committee.</p>
<p>Abolish the "Give-Instruction" Fee: Before the early years of the Republic of China, Zhu Tinghua, the director of the Encouragement of Learning Office, drafted regulations to raise funds for municipal education, which were approved by the county to collect a "give-instruction" fee of two yuan per certificate. After County Magistrate Li took office, he believed that this "give-instruction" fee was like a bad custom. If a certificate should be issued, there is no need for this fee. If a certificate should not be issued, even with this fee, it cannot be approved, so he issued an order to abolish it.</p>
<p>Security Corps Arrests Reactionary Criminal: After the assassination of Xu Xingfu, the deputy commander of the Security Corps of Deshun Township in Shazhou, the bandits became very active. A few days ago, reactionary slogans signed by Lu Mazi, the commander of the 13th Division of the Red Army, appeared in Houji and Shanzhengqiao. The Security Corps tore them down and preserved them. On the 12th, Cai Chengxu of that place extorted silver dollars from his father. The Third District Office summoned him and found a letter on his person. After checking, the handwriting was the same as that of the slogans. Chen Songshan immediately interrogated him and confessed to Shi Li and others. They were immediately arrested on the 13th and handed over to the captain of the First Squad of the police for interrogation and trial.</p>
<p>Converting Money into Silver Dollars and Presenting to the Court for Explanation: The Provincial Government stated that the Construction Department had verified the situation of the Jiangyin Relief Home's public funds deposited as collateral and the conversion of money into silver dollars. The committee decided that the annual exchange rate should be verified and handled according to the discounted method, which specifically refers to the Construction Department's deposits. However, there were still many disputes over analogies. In the event of a dispute over the discount rate of money and silver dollars in general deposits, should it be handled according to the example of redeeming immovable property or calculated according to the discounted method? As this matter concerned the law, it was specially presented to the Judicial Yuan for explanation the other day.</p>
<p>Department Sends Investigator to Investigate Banditry: The Department of Civil Affairs believed that banditry was rampant in Jiangbei and Jiangyin. The other day, it sent Inspector Huang Chao to Jingjiang to investigate. Yesterday (the 12th), he went to Cheng with the Chief of Public Security Zhu to investigate banditry in Sanguan Township and decided to return to the province on the 13th.</p>

<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Autonomous Regions Plan to Implement Merger: This county's autonomous region was originally divided into twelve districts. Since the implementation of district administration, it has continued to operate according to the old system. Now, because the size of the area is not appropriate, there are many obstacles in management. The county government is soliciting opinions and instructing each district to draft merger methods for implementation. It is now heard that the public opinion in this county mostly advocates merging into eight districts and plans to submit it to the fourth district administration meeting for public decision.</p>
<p>Case Solved, Bandit Captured: The case of Chen Songsheng's home in Shangdeshi being robbed by bandits, resulting in the death of his mother due to injuries, has not been solved for several months. Yesterday, Yang Yuting, a plainclothes bailiff from the county government, learned that the bandits in this case, Li Xiaobing and Li Bingrong, had secretly returned to their hometown. He secretly went to Lingkou to arrest Li and others and escorted them to the county for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Disaster Situation in All Townships of Zhenjiang: Recently, due to frequent rainy weather, a disaster situation has developed in all townships of Zhenjiang. The findings of the survey are recorded below: (1) Death of Spring Silkworms: The development of silkworms depends entirely on warm weather, but the weather this spring has been hot and cold and continuous rain, so eight out of ten silkworms have died from disease. Each township is afraid of losing all income from silk. (2) Rotting of Two Wheats: Wheat is inherently fond of dryness. This year, due to heavy rains, most of the barley has rotted, and there is no hope of harvest. Although wheat is not completely damaged, if it continues to rain, it will be difficult to expect a good harvest. (3) Danger to Rice Seedlings: Since sowing, the rice seedlings have also failed to develop due to excessive rain and have been damaged by waterlogging, which may affect the autumn harvest. Therefore, the people of each township are worried.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Judicial Case Files to Be Transferred to the Court on Schedule: The county government stated that Yao Huanzhi, a commissioner assigned by the High Court, came to Yangzhou to discuss the handover of the county court's handling of judicial case files.

<p>Opening of Dongjin and Liang Dams: Wu Tongju, the chief of the Jiangbei Grand Canal Engineering Office, said that the water level in Bengbu Yaowan was high and that the water stored in the Three Ditch Canal's Zhi pile had reached 1 zhang 2 chi 1 cun. In addition to sending staff member Sun Fuxue to supervise the flood control officer Tao Pei to open the Dongwan Jinzhang and Liang dams to discharge water, he had also decided to take precautionary measures. As soon as it rained, he would continue to open the Fenghuang Lanjiang dams.</p>
<p>Order to Investigate Unauthorized Opening of Grand Canal Culverts: The county government reported that the chief of the Second Autonomous District, He Liuqi, had reported that Zhong Junbo and Hong Hengai, the managers of Junqiao Canal, had reported that the local villagers were freely opening the culverts along the Grand Canal, endangering farmland, and requested that the county stop them. Yesterday (the 11th), it specially instructed the Construction Bureau to investigate the local water conservancy situation and whether it was necessary to prohibit or open the culverts and submit a report for verification.</p>
<p>Plan to Raise Funds for Township Offices: Because the township offices in the first district of the Jiangbei County had no funds, they proposed at the fifth district affairs meeting to deduct 10% of the funds from the people's purchase and sale of farmland to fill the township offices' funds. It was decided that Yu Ruzhou, the chief of the Sports Town, would draft a solution and submit it to the county for approval. It is now heard that the township chiefs have jointly submitted a report to the First District Office to establish a deed tax management office in each township office to specialize in issuing official deeds. Anyone who mediates in the people's purchase and sale of farmland property must declare and register at the office to obtain a stamped contract for tax payment. Every ten days, they must fill out a form and submit it along with the collected autonomous funds to the district office for verification and transfer for distribution to fill the township offices' funds.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>

County Magistrate Wang agreed to summon Director Chen to preside over the matter. The teachers did not leave the government until 8:00 p.m.</p>

Liu Zurong and Chen Fude, who had been dismissed as police officers, filed a complaint with the court. It is now heard that the court ordered the witnesses to appear in court for investigation at 1:00 p.m. on the 12th. Patrol Chief Cao and Wang Fuxiang did not arrive due to other matters. Yu Jingchang and the village chief Li Qinchang and others came to the case, stating that the signatures on the various documents signed by the Fengjing branch bureau were all coerced by Chief Wu using intimidation and inducement to accuse the patrol chief. The prosecutor, because Cao Xunwei and Wang Fuxiang had not yet arrived, released Yu Jingchang and others on bail and set a date for a joint interrogation.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Ordered to Postpone Transfer: County Magistrate Shen Guangxiong was previously ordered by the provincial government to switch positions with County Magistrate Ye of Changshan, and he immediately instructed each department to handle the handover. It is now heard that County Magistrate Shen received an order from the provincial government on the 12th stating that due to the tense defense of Changshan, the transfer would be postponed temporarily, and the date of the exchange would be ordered separately.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Sugar Donation Bureau Budget Approved: The Zhejiang Department of Finance will collect the sugar donation that sugar merchants recognize as provincial-run, and has appointed Fu Zhong as the director to set up a bureau to handle it. Director Fu drafted a regular budget and submitted it to the Department of Finance for submission to the Provincial Government Meeting for review by the Finance Review Committee. It is now heard that the budget was approved by the Provincial Government yesterday after being revised in accordance with the review report.</p>
<p>Training Corps Fully Established: In order to implement training and improve military intelligence, the Zhejiang Security Office established a training corps, which is divided into four squadrons. After the approval of the Provincial Government, the preparation began. It is now heard that the team has been fully compiled and established, and a roster of officers and soldiers has been created and reported to the office for record.</p>
<p>Discussing the Aftermath of the Si'an Disturbance: Zhu Jiaji, the director of the Zhejiang Department of Civil Affairs, said that in Si'an, hungry people joined with ruffians to rob the Renji and Qingji rice shops of about 200 shi of rice. A battalion of the 30th National Army fired warning shots to suppress the disturbance, resulting in the injury and death of more than 50 hungry people, causing chaos in the area. It is heard that the proposal to discuss the aftermath measures will be put forward at the provincial government meeting today (the 14th) to calm the people's hearts.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Jin Yourong Kidnapped and Released: Jin Yourong, the owner of the Feng Leg Ham Shop in Linpu Town, Xiaoshan, who is over sixty years old, was kidnapped by bandits when he returned home from work a few days ago. His family searched everywhere but could not find him. Yesterday, Mr. Jin returned safely. According to Mr. Jin, he was kidnapped by bandits from Sheng County and lived in the countryside. Later, the bandits found out that his family had no large sums of money, so he was able to escape safely.</p>
<p>Recent Status of Qian Industry Lending: The Qian industry in Xiaoshao lends in two types: long-term and revolving. Long-term lending mainly involves silk, cloth, and rice. In recent years, due to the difficulty in developing the silk and cloth industries, the scope has been reduced, and the need has decreased sharply. The rice industry has been trending upwards, and the profits earned are sufficient to take care of itself. Therefore, long-term lending has decreased by a quarter compared to previous years. However, revolving lending is very active due to the bullish trend in the tea market and is used for speculation. Recently, the deposits in the Qianzhuang in Shaoxiao have been increasing due to the succession of the silkworm cocoon market, so both the silver and money industries are storing as much as possible so that tea and silkworm cocoon merchants can withdraw money at any time.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Bandits Gather in Siming Mountain: On the 6th, the detective team of Dingjiafan Dalong, 19th Township, Southern Township, received a report from an informant that about 500 to 600 bandits were scattered in rare caves in Siming Mountain, which borders the counties of Yu, Fenghua, Yin, and Sheng, hiding in various counties to kidnap people and demand ransoms. The bandit leaders were Chen Tianbao, Wang Guozhen, and Mao Mou. Chen Tianbao's gang was the most brutal. Wang Guozhen had more financial resources than Chen and had more new-style firearms. There were dozens of box cannons and two machine guns. Mao Mou's gang was weaker than the other two bandits, but they were all villains who harmed the people. Because the Fenghua army was searching very urgently, there was a tendency to flee into the county. After receiving the report, the team was on alert day and night and investigated the location of the bandits in order to request that a large team be sent to annihilate them in one fell swoop.</p>

<h3>Japan's Strength in the Far Eastern Games</h3>
<p>Track and field is full of talent, and women's results are even better. Tennis players overwhelm Chinese and Filipino players at the Carnival. Swimmers gather in the country to fight against the Philippines. Basketball uses a personal selection system with average skills. The volleyball team is too weak and far behind China and the Philippines. The soccer team is childish and incompetent and ridiculously wants the championship. There are many baseball talents, but there is the strong enemy of China. (Tokyo Communication) The Far Eastern Games are approaching, and the atmosphere of preparation for each country is gradually becoming intense. Since the 6th Games, Japan's influence in the Far Eastern Games has been very strong, and each time it has won the championship and overwhelmed the strong Philippines. Japan's victory is nothing more than its ability to work hard in training consistently and without any slack. In the past, Japan's track and field and swimming were far behind the Philippines, so it was humiliated at every conference. However, the enthusiasm of the Japanese is booming and they always aim to wipe out their shame. So far, the Philippines is no match for Japan. This is not a decline in the Philippines, but indeed an advance in Japan. The old courage and spirit of the Japanese are truly amazing. In this year's conference, Japan still has an advantage. Except for the three ball skills of basketball, volleyball, and soccer, Japan may not be able to defeat China and the Philippines. In other areas such as track and field, all-around, swimming, baseball, and tennis, Japan has hopes of victory. Due to geographical and climatic reasons, China and the Philippines are difficult to beat. For the Japanese. The various athletes in Japan have now been selected, including the basketball, volleyball, soccer, and tennis teams. As for the track and field athletes, preliminary selections have been held in various places, and the Japan National Student Track and Field Competition will be held in Tokyo in mid-month. At that time, official athletes who will participate in the conference can be produced. Although the baseball representatives have not been officially decided, the Keio team is the most promising. The venues and other preparations have been properly prepared. The following is a record of the strength of various Japanese competitions.</p>
<h3>(1) Track and Field</h3>
<p>Recently, Japan has made rapid progress in men's track and field, especially in long-distance running, where they score the most points in each event. Therefore, Japan is most confident in winning the track and field championship. Currently, they are only weaker in short-distance running than the Philippines because the Philippine sprinters are mostly tall and long-legged, while the Japanese are short and small, making it difficult to catch up. This is the only area where they cannot compete with the Philippines. However, in long-distance running at the Far Eastern Games, it is unlikely that anyone can compete with them because the Japanese physique is stronger than the Chinese and Filipinos, allowing them to endure hardship. The comparison of the performances of Chinese, Filipino, and Japanese athletes in long and short-distance races is as follows:</p>
<p>10,000 Meters</p>
<p>China: Zhao Dexin: 35 minutes 33 seconds</p>
<p>Japan: Kitamoto Tadashi: 33 minutes 32 seconds</p>
<p>Philippines: Diagula Gros: 36 minutes 35 seconds</p>
<p>100 Meters</p>
<p>China: Liu Changchun: 11 seconds</p>
<p>Japan: Murakami Kunpei: 10 seconds</p>
<p>Philippines: Shin Tsuchika: 10 seconds</p>
<p>200 Meters</p>
<p>China: Liu Changchun: 22.8 seconds</p>
<p>Japan: Murakami Kunpei: 21.6 seconds</p>
<p>Philippines: Shin Tsuchika: 22 seconds</p>
<p>Japan's 10.6-second record in the 100 meters was achieved during last year's Top Ten Sprinters Competition. In general, Japan has a wealth of talented field athletes with remarkable results, and there is no shortage of outstanding athletes. Japan still hopes to maintain this championship in this year's Games and has decided to send 70 track and field athletes to participate. The names and results of the outstanding athletes from the Kanto and Kansai preliminary competitions are recorded below:</p>
<p>(100 Meters) Murakami Kunpei (10.6 seconds), Aizawa Iwao (10.7 seconds), Oda Mikio (11.1 seconds), Nambu Chuhei (11.2 seconds)</p>
<p>(200 Meters) Murakami Kunpei (21.5 seconds), Aizawa Iwao (21.6 seconds), Nishi Iwao (22.2 seconds), Abu Iwao (22.8 seconds)</p>
<p>(400 Meters) Nado Shigetoku (50.2 seconds), Oki Masaki (51.4 seconds), Nishi Sadaichi (51.6 seconds)</p>
<p>(800 Meters) Kuwata Yoshiyuki (1 minute 58.6 seconds), Okada Hideo (2 minutes 0 seconds), Kishi Genzaemon (2 minutes 1.4 seconds)</p>
<p>(1500 Meters) Tsuchiya Koshio (4 minutes 7 seconds), Kaiyoku Yasuji (4 minutes 12 seconds), Tsuda Seiichi (4 minutes 14.9 seconds)</p>
<p>(5000 Meters) Kitamoto Tadashi (15 minutes 30.8 seconds), Bo Seiichi (16 minutes 21.4 seconds), Mizutani Juichi (15 minutes 406 seconds)</p>
<p>(10,000 Meters) Kitamoto Tadashi (33 minutes 32 seconds), Tashiro Kikunosuke (33 minutes 54.6 seconds)</p>
<p>(High Hurdles) Fukui Yukio (24.3 seconds), Iwanaga Yoshizumi (24.7 seconds), Isai Ken (25.3 seconds)</p>
<p>(400 Meter Relay) Watari Anma Fuji Murakami (43.2 seconds)</p>
<p>(800 Meter Relay) Yoshioka Nambu Nakata Oka (1 minute 29.2 seconds)</p>
<p>(1600 Meter Relay) Ogawa Tanaka Matsushige Nado (3 minutes 25.8 seconds)</p>
<p>(High Jump) Kimura Kazuo (1.94 meters)</p>
<p>(Long Jump) Nambu Chuhei (7.45 meters)</p>
<p>(Pole Vault) Nishida Mikio (15.4 meters), Oshima Kenkichi (14.60 meters)</p>
<p>(Triple Jump) Oda Mikio (15.4 meters), Oshima Kenkichi (14.74 meters)</p>
<p>(Javelin Throw) Sumiyoshi Kosaku (61.81 meters)</p>
<p>(Shot Put) Takada Shizuo (15.53 meters), Mizokawa Suekichi (14.85 meters)</p>
<p>(Discus Throw) Saito Makoto (42.05 meters), Okita Yoshio (41.22 meters)</p>
<p>Women's The Japanese women athletes are even more outstanding than the men. Three years ago, Japan defeated Sweden to win the world women's championship. At that time, during the third World Women's Athletic Games, Ms. Hitomi Kinue suddenly shocked the world. At that time, the lady was only nineteen years old, a young girl not valued by the world. Unexpectedly, she overwhelmed athletes from nine countries and broke the German women's 100-meter record of 12.4 seconds, creating a new world record of 12 seconds. In front of hundreds of thousands of spectators, she won the international championship gold cup. At the closing ceremony, the president, Ms. Mildred (President of the International Women's Sports Federation), greatly praised Ms. Hitomi and was so reluctant to part that they bid farewell in tears. The reputation of Japanese women in the world is very high and cannot be matched by our country. The strength of Japanese women's track and field is as follows:</p>

<p>(2) Swimming</p>
<p>The reason for Japan's humiliation in swimming last time in Shanghai was that the United States held an international swimming competition in Honolulu at that time, and Japan sent its elite athletes, five or six people, to participate there. Therefore, they had to send second-rate athletes to participate in the Far Eastern Games, resulting in a disastrous defeat. However, in this year's Games, Japan certainly has a chance of winning because all the excellent athletes will not go abroad before the Games but will stay in the country to wait for the strong Philippine enemy. At the last Shanghai Games, the Philippine swimming champion, Mr. Sirga, had a record of 27.2 seconds in the 50-meter freestyle and became the record holder of the Games. Now, Japan's Mr. Takaishi Katsuo has broken that record, creating a good result of 20.8 seconds. As for the 200-meter breaststroke, the Philippines' results are also slightly inferior to Japan's. The comparison is as follows:</p>
<p>Philippines: Iru Tudiosun: 2 minutes 52.4 seconds</p>
<p>Japan: Tsuruta Yoshiyuki: 2 minutes 45 seconds</p>
<p>According to the above records, Japan is stronger than the Philippines. This record was the result of the competition between the Philippines and Japan at last year's International Competition (held in Amsterdam). It is expected that the Philippines will certainly prepare for the opportunity in this year's Games to avenge last year's shame. In the future, the two countries will definitely not give way to each other in the battle. In other respects, such as the 400-meter freestyle and the 1500-meter freestyle, the results of Japan and the Philippines are equal. However, Philippine army's Mr. Dabir is terrible in the 100-meter backstroke, but Japan is quite confident in the 200-meter relay. The list of Japanese swimming committee members and athletes for this year is as follows:</p>
<p>Committee Members: Iide Ishimoto Honda Tabata Kobayashi Matsuzawa Nomura Sugimoto Nishimoto</p>
<p>Athletes: Oshima Masao Uraki Yoshio Okajima Takeo Katayama Kenkichi Katsuta Tadamitsu Sada Tokuhei Takaishi Katsuo Takemura Kiyoshi Takemura Torao Yunaka Kazuo Tsuruta Yoshiyuki Hayakawa Sadamasa Masuda Saburo Matsumura Motoyoshi Matsumoto Takashige Miyamoto Takeo Murakami Hiroshi Yasuda Suekichi Yokoyama Takashi</p>
<p>This time, there are 19 Japanese swimming athletes, all of whom are famous champions in their country. Japan is an island nation, and outstanding swimming athletes are also its natural product. Many Japanese women also practice swimming. The names of the Japanese women's swimming athletes participating in the public performance this year are as follows:</p>
<p>50 Meters: Ando Misao, Miyagi Kiyoko, Katayama Eiko</p>
<p>100 Meters: Miyazaki Yuriko, Ichiguchi Fusako, Katayama Eiko</p>
<p>200 Meters: Ichiguchi Fusako</p>
<p>400 Meters: Ichiguchi Fusako</p>
<p>100 Meter Backstroke: Kujunko Atsuko, Suzuki Riyo, Mizutani Kimiko</p>
<p>200 Meter Breaststroke: Maehata Hideko, Iimura Masako, Tabata Momoko</p>
<p>Springboard Diving: Ozawa Toshiko, Ishiwatari Chikako</p>
<p>Reverse Springboard Diving: Ishiwatari Chikako</p>
<p>The ancient Japanese swimming style will also be included in this year's swimming public performance for the purpose of increasing interest only.</p>
<p>(3) Tennis</p>
<p>Japan's tennis has made rapid progress recently. The Japanese representatives, Sato and Nunoi, suffered setbacks in Shanghai before, but after diligent practice, they have now overwhelmed China and the Philippines. They won the triple crown in this year's Carnival. Japan has high hopes for this year's tennis championship. The names of the athletes are as follows:</p>
<p>Men's Singles</p>
<p>Sato Jiro, Waseda University</p>
<p>Nunoi Ryosuke, Kobe Commercial University</p>
<p>Harada Naoji (Candidate), Keio University</p>
<p>Kamachi Hidekatsu (Candidate), Individual</p>
<p>Men's Doubles</p>
<p>Yamagishi Seiichi, Keio University</p>
<p>Shimura Hikoshichi, Keio University</p>
<p>Sato Jiro (Candidate), Waseda University</p>
<p>Kawachi Minoru (Candidate), Waseda University</p>
<p>Women's Singles</p>
<p>Kobayashi Tomoko, Aichi Shukutoku</p>
<p>Takiguchi Reiko, Individual</p>
<p>Iimura Toshiko (Candidate)</p>
<p>Women's Doubles</p>
<p>Kobayashi Tomoko, Aichi Shukutoku</p>
<p>Asabuki Isoko, Omori Girls' High School</p>
<p>Takiguchi Reiko (Candidate), Individual</p>
<p>Iimura Toshiko (Candidate), Individual</p>
<p>Brief Biographies of Tennis Players: The past records and achievements of the Japanese tennis representatives for this year are as follows:</p>
<p>Sato Jiro: After the tennis stars such as Abe Kawajiri Aizawa Aso graduated from Waseda University one after another, Sato's reputation suddenly spread throughout the tennis world. In 1928, he won repeatedly, and the Japanese called him a genius player. His tennis skills are often amazing. In 1929, he won fifth place in the country, and this year he won third place in the country. He was sent to the Philippines to participate in the Carnival and won a great victory. He is now selected as the Japanese tennis representative for the Far Eastern Games.</p>
<p>Nunoi Ryosuke: We first heard of Nunoi's tennis skills last year. At that time, he once defeated the famous Uehara, and then he suddenly shocked the tennis world. Last year, he was the 19th in the country, and this year he rose to the fourth place. In February of this year, he and Sato traveled to Manila and defeated Lin Baohua.</p>
<p>Yamagishi and Shimura: The two are the most prestigious and skilled in doubles at Keio University. They once defeated Harada and Kumagai in a competition two years ago and won a great victory. In 1928, they were fifth in the national doubles. Now they have jumped to first place.</p>
<p>Kobayashi Tomoko: Ms. Kobayashi is the national women's hard court champion in Japan. Even men find it difficult to defeat her. In 1929, she defeated the national champion of Japan.</p>
<p>Asabuki Isoko: Madam is currently 40 years old, and her son is already studying in middle school. Her tennis skills are old and strong, and she wins every battle. Madam has not participated in any competitions in the past three or four years. This year, at the invitation of the Japan Sports Association, she will participate in the Games to assist in the women's doubles.</p>
<p>Takiguchi Reiko: Ms. Takiguchi is slightly inferior to Kobayashi, but she has done a lot of research in her daily practice.</p>
<h3>(4) Basketball</h3>
<p>Men's Basketball: Japan's basketball has always been inferior to China and the Philippines and has always suffered defeats in each Games. This year, the representatives were announced early so that the players could get long-term practice to strengthen their strength. This time, the Japanese players are selected individually, and the team members are composed of the main players from various basketball teams across the country. They will conduct a training camp to integrate their skills and resist the strong enemies of China and the Philippines. The names of the representatives are as follows: Nomura, Kurosawa, Ohashi, Kawaguchi, Hayakawa, Tobari, Ueda, Kosaka, Ouchi, Tanaka, Inoue, Nakamura, Oba, Dohi, Kenmochi, Uchida, Ohashi, Kamiho, Kobayashi.</p>
<p>Each athlete is both experienced and a promising new talent. When they compete in the Games, ten of the most elite players will be selected to participate. Japan's selection of athletes this time is based on new knowledge from the United States. The height of the players must reach 5 feet 6 inches, and the weight must be 16 kan (each kan is 6 catties and 4 taels). Although Japan has selected carefully, the tallest of its athletes is no more than 5 feet 5 inches. The height of the players is very important for victory or defeat. The failure of Japanese basketball is due to the short stature of its players in each Games. Although Japan's players have worked hard in training this time, they are still afraid of being defeated by China and the Philippines because the Japanese do not pay much attention to basketball on weekdays. They are no match for China and the Philippines, who have loved ball sports since childhood. Although Japan is unlikely to avoid failure in this year's competition, we cannot underestimate the progress of its tactics.</p>
<p>Women's Basketball: The Japanese women's basketball team this year is the Kobe Commercial School team, which once defeated our country in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>(5) Volleyball</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the Far Eastern Games, Japan's volleyball has been absent five times and only appeared three times, but all three times have resulted in failure. In the Tokyo Shibaura Games in 1917 and the Shanghai Games in 1921, Japan had no official volleyball representatives. From the sixth Osaka Games to the eighth Shanghai Games, Japan began to send official players to participate, but its strength was too poor and far less than the technology of China and the Philippines. Japan has carefully selected the representatives to participate in this year's Games, selecting a total of 21 outstanding players from across the country. From March to April 8, they will conduct the first phase of training in Takamatsu City. From April to May, they will go to Tokyo for the second phase of training. Finally, eleven official athletes will be selected to participate in the Games. The lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Forwards: Kawabata Tsuneichi (Kagawa Normal School), Kojima Shunyu (Hiroshima Bundai), Masa Kimi (Hiroshima No. 2 Middle School), Nakamura Shogo (Kobe Commercial University), Ogui Yoshikimi (Yahata High School), Take Kiyoji (Kobe Commercial University), Taniyama Shun (Kure Naval School)</p>
<p>Centers: Ebahta Yoshitaro (Kobe Commercial University), Toshi Fujike Dairou (Kagawa Normal School), Imai Takeo (Meiji Gakuin), Inoue Tsuneo (Kobe Commercial University), Murata Tomoyuki (Kobe Commercial University), Nehashi Shiro (Yahata High School), Sakagami Mitsuo (Japan Gymnastics), Urakami Toru (Ikeda Normal School)</p>
<p>Backs: Akagi Isao (Hiroshima No. 2 Middle School), Kame Komeji (Kobe Commercial University), Katsumura Hiroaki (Kobe Commercial University), Koita Hiroshi (Kobe Commercial University), Minato Toshiro (Kobe Commercial University), Saiki Ichiro (Kobe Commercial University)</p>
<p>The national volleyball champion of Japan is Kobe Commercial University. Most of the Japanese representatives for this year are also selected from this team. Last year, the Shanghai Fudan team traveled to Japan and struggled to resist before achieving a draw. The Japanese, in view of the fact that the Chinese volleyball team's forwards are all tall players, have decided to select Masa Kimi, Taniyama, and Take Kiyoji, three giants, as forwards. The centers are served by strong players such as (Goto) Inoue and Sakagami. The backs are all in charge of the battle-hardened Kobe Commercial University team.</p>
<h3>(6) Soccer</h3>
<p>Japan's soccer performance is still in its infancy, and it has always suffered defeats in each Games. But the Japanese are daydreaming and now fantasize about the Games championship, claiming that their soccer team will definitely defeat China and the Philippines in this year's Games, making a groundbreaking move. There are 19 players, and their names are as follows:</p>
<p>Abe Koji Ichihashi Tokizo Ide Tomio Omachi Shimagishi Yama Yoshiiku Kondo Daigoro Goto Ryuo Saito Saizo Sasashima Hideo Sugimura Shozaburo Takayama Tadao Takeuchi Teizo Takekoshi Shigemaru Teshima Shiro Nishimura Kiyoshi Nosawa Masao Haruyama Taiyo Honda Nagayasu Wakabayashi Takeo</p>
<h3>Emblem of the Far Eastern Games</h3>

<p>The players are selected from both Tokyo and Kansai, and their training camp is progressing fiercely. According to general speculation, although Japan is no match for our country, it still has a chance of being runner-up no matter what. China and the Philippines often have disputes and conflicts in soccer matches at each Games. The Philippines expressed dissatisfaction at the seventh Manila Games and the eighth Shanghai Games. This year's Games will still be difficult to avoid disturbances. The Japanese have decided to adopt a tolerant doctrine and take the opportunity to work hard and hope to defeat the strong enemy of China.</p>
<h3>(7) Baseball</h3>
<p>Japan's baseball holds hegemony in the Far Eastern Games, and its sophisticated offensive and defensive methods cannot be matched by our country. The representatives to participate in the Games have not yet been decided. Currently, six schools, including Waseda University, Tokyo University, Keio University, Meiji University, Rikkyo University, and Hosei University, are holding a round-robin tournament in Tokyo, which will be completed soon.

<h3>Chinese Tennis Exhibition</h3>
<p>Qiu Feihai and Lin Baohua Won Two Sets to One Against Kata</p>
<p>Li Lianhua and Li Xinghua Lost Zero Sets to Two Against Xingke</p>
<p>Peony Flower Was Absent Yesterday</p>
<p>The Reason for the Failure is the Sandy Ground</p>
<p>Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai, our country's tennis players attending the Far Eastern Games, played an exhibition match against Shanghai tennis doubles champions Cannavaro and Tavorse at the Chinese Tennis Court yesterday to practice in preparation for the competition in Japan. At the same time, the Western YMCA women's doubles final was also held at the same venue. The players were our country's Li Xinghua and Li Lianhua against Fields and Crawford. As a result, Qiu and Lin won against Kata with scores of 6-3, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3, while our country's Li sisters lost in the women's final with scores of 0-6 and 2-6. The detailed description of the situation is as follows:</p>
<h3>(1) Qiu Feihai and Lin Baohua Won Two Sets to One</h3>
<p>At 4:00 p.m., Qiu and Lin began the match against Kata. Qiu and Lin each have their own strengths. Lin's serve and Qiu's calmness are the best of both. The opponents are the big shots of Shanghai tennis doubles and won three championships last year in the grass court competition, the hard court competition, and the Robber Cup. However, because the tennis season has just begun this year, they have not had the opportunity to practice, so yesterday's performance was not perfect. For example, in the Western Youth Tennis Tournament a few days ago, the two actually lost to Bu Tuo and Zheng Zhaojia, which was also unexpected. Qiu and Lin's victory yesterday was not fierce. If Qiu and Lin can work hard, it should not be difficult to create a "straight three" result.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the confrontation, Lin and Qiu took the lead and won three consecutive games with great momentum. Kata rose up to fight and won one game after dozens of rounds of battle. Then they won another game. Our country's Lin Baohua served four consecutive times, and the opponent could not return one, so they created a score of five to two with "glide four", which showed great skill. After Kata added a game, Lin and Qiu won the first set with six to three. The competition in the second set was fierce. The initial situation was similar to the first set, but Kata took the lead and once led with a score of three to zero, one to four, and two to five, with a great momentum to grab the set. And Lin and Qiu shook their spirits and went all out, reversing the defeat with seven to five and winning the second set. The short-range battle in this set showed great skill and won a lot of applause from five or six hundred spectators.</p>
<p>In the third set, Lin Baohua was quite lazy and lost a lot of points. After the score was two to two, Kata took the lead, full of energy and working hard, and regained the set with six to four. In the fifth game, Lin's draw was handy and extremely fierce, and Tavorse was good at parrying. After a long battle, Qiu Feihai touched a cold spot and hit the opponent's vital point, which was praised by the audience. As a result, Lin and Qiu won with six to three.</p>
<p>Li Lianhua and Li Lianhua Lost Zero Sets to Two</p>
<p>After this match, the Western YMCA women's doubles final began. In the first set, the Li sisters were at a loss and lost six consecutive games. When it reached four to zero (Fei and Ke took the lead) in the second set, the two Li suddenly had a special performance and scored two consecutive games, which was quite praised, but in the end, it was difficult to save the situation due to the fierce momentum of the opponent. As a result, Fields and Crawford won again with six to two. Looking at the performance of Xinghua and Lianhua, they lack vitality because they dare not run on the slippery sandy ground. This is the biggest reason for the failure. It is said that the Li sisters were accustomed to practicing in the water gate court when they were in Java, so they did not feel slippery. Now they feel very inconvenient after changing to the island, and there is a pity that they cannot do anything, which leads to a decrease in performance and they cannot show their skills, which is very regrettable.</p>
<h3>Chinese Men's Volleyball Match</h3>
<p>Won Against the Mixed Team with Two Sets to Zero Yesterday</p>
<p>The Chinese volleyball team played a match against the Shanghai mixed team at the Athletics Ground yesterday. The mixed team was still based on Fudan, and the strength of the mixed team did not increase enough to compete without Cao Tingzan (because Cao was in the team of atheletes) and with the addition of three to five people. The situation was very different, and there was a lack of excitement. As a result, the team of athletes won two consecutive games with scores of 21-2 and 21-6.</p>

<h3>Twenty-Four Shanghai Groups</h3>
<p>Farewell to Far Eastern Athletes</p>
<p>Twenty-four groups, including the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, held a farewell party at 2:30 p.m. yesterday on the eighth floor of the Hua An Building for our country's athletes who will be departing for the Far Eastern Games. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>The number of attendees included representatives and guests from the host side, such as the Municipal Education Bureau, the World Chinese Students' Association, Jiaotong, Jinan, Tongji, Labor, Fudan, Guanghua, Datong, Chizhi, Shanghai Law School, Shanghai Political Science and Law School, Qixiu Girls' School, Liangjiang Girls' School, Jingwu Association, Shen Bao, News Report, Current Affairs News, Min Guo Daily, Times, China Review Weekly, Commercial Press, and Zhonghua Book Company, a total of 24 groups, as well as Ma Xiangbo, Director of Physical Education at Zhongda, Wu Yunrui, and others. About 100 athletes arrived. First, a group photo was taken downstairs. There were many photographers from various newspapers and private individuals. After the photography, they went upstairs and took their seats. The athletes were seated at round tables, and the hosts were at long tables. After the ceremony was completed,</p>
<p>Chairman Chen Dezheng gave a speech. First, he reported the names of the various groups on the host side and said, "Today is the farewell party for the athletes who will be going to the Far Eastern Games to compete for honor and victory. I have learned in the newspapers in recent days that the skills of the athletes of various countries participating in the Far Eastern Games have improved and created new records. In previous Far Eastern Games, the box could not always win an excellent position, which is a shame for China. It is also enough to show that the people of our country have failed to pay widespread attention to sports, and the name 'Sick Man of East Asia' has no way to be washed away. I deeply hope that you will cross the ocean this time to win glory for the country and use all your strength to seek supreme honor. Recently, the results of the competitions between the athletes and the American overseas Chinese have been unexpected. This fact deserves attention. The people of our country have a bad habit. The Japanese are particularly attentive. It should not be used in the bud. The sports world is very anxious about the recent training results, and it is like a bone in the throat. Therefore, in a word, sports achievements cannot be obtained by luck. Only after daily cultivation and practice can it be achieved. Other things such as daily life, diet, and all other lives should be noted. You should pay special attention to it and not neglect it. Narrow-mindedness and jealousy are special notes of the Japanese. This kind of excessive worry should be carefully considered. The Japanese attach great importance to discipline in sports. You should not act individually on this trip, which is irrelevant to the national system. You should know that the gain or loss of every move is related to the reputation of the country. Our people know that your patriotism is no less than that of others. I would like to offer one more principle: Love the gentleman and love the people with virtue. At the last Far Eastern Games held in Shanghai, the championships won by China and Japan were the same. Only because of track and field, the overall championship was won by the Japanese, and the people of our country used fate to explain it. This time, this mentality should not be kept. We should go to the meeting with the ambition to win. The general public has a heart of fear and fear. You should not be like this, and you should also be like the Japanese and Filipinos, who regard each championship as having the heroic strategy of who else but me. The shame of the sick man can be washed away. China and Japan are very close, and there are few storms in the Pacific Ocean. However, we are particularly concerned about the preservation of your health. I sincerely hope that you will choose these words carefully. You are encouraged."</p>
<p>The speeches were followed by Ma Xiangbo, Liu Banzhu, Ming, and others, and the flag-giving ceremony was held.</p>
<h3>The YMCA Cancels Farewell to Athletes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA originally planned to bid farewell to the Chinese athletes of the Far Eastern Games at 2:00 p.m. today. It is now reported that the Secretary-General of the China Sports Promotion Association said that the athletes are in a hurry and cannot attend the meeting. In addition to notifying the various participating organizations to stop holding the event, the prepared commemorative handbook will be distributed to the athletes.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Education is Still Handled Directly by the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously approved the Ministry of Foreign Affairs's consultation based on the request of various embassies and consulates stationed abroad, requesting that all departments consult the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for any joint affairs. The Ministry of Education then replied in a consultation stating that the overseas Chinese education managed by the overseas consulates has been directly handled by the Ministry of Education. Since the promulgation of the Administrative Regulations for Overseas Consuls Managing Overseas Chinese Education, the consuls' reports on the handling of education have been enthusiastic and convenient, and there have been no malpractices. If matters concerning overseas Chinese education are also changed to be transferred by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, not only will there be more twists and turns, but also the political efficiency may be greatly reduced. The Ministry of Education intends that in the future, except for matters directly related to foreign affairs that are transferred by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all matters concerning overseas Chinese education will still be directly handled by the Ministry of Education. After this consultation was delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently replied to the Ministry of Education, expressing its approval and requesting that the Ministry of Education consult and record after directly handling matters concerning overseas Chinese education.</p>

<h3>Foreign Ships Docking in Anqing</h3>
<p>Chinese Shipping Opposes</p>
<p>The Yangtze River is China's only inland waterway and is highly valued by British, Japanese and other foreign merchants. In recent years, companies such as Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Nisshin have spared no effort in adding ships and increasing ports along this route, eager to expand their competition. Chinese shipping companies, in the last two years, have barely remained afloat due to the impact of internal warfare. It is only now that they are gradually recovering. However, there is still a significant shortage of goods coming from Wuhan and beyond. As Chinese shipping companies are resuming operations, foreign shipping companies suddenly seek to dock at inland ports that were previously prohibited from establishing regular shipping routes. This matter has a significant impact on national sovereignty and commercial shipping, and Chinese shipping merchants in Shanghai have already voiced their opposition. The reasons are detailed below:</p>
<p>Foreign Ships Seek to Establish Ports in Anqing. According to the Treaty of Tianjin, foreign merchants' ships are not allowed to establish ports or dock at Yangtze River ports such as Anqing, Datong, and Shashi because the aforementioned locations are not open treaty ports. However, British and Japanese shipping companies in Shanghai already have wharves in Wuhu in southern Anhui. Due to restrictions in Anqing in northern Anhui, they are only allowed to anchor in the river when ships pass through, and passengers and goods are transported by civilian boats. Anqing only has wharves built by Chinese merchants such as China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Sanpei Shipping, so their business operations are better than foreign ships. However, British and Japanese shipping companies have never forgotten their desire to build wharves. Now, taking advantage of the Anhui authorities' new construction plans, they seize the opportunity to obtain the right to dock at Anqing, achieving their goal.</p>
<p>Anhui Province Allows Foreign Ships to Dock. The Anhui provincial government, as part of its new transportation plan, has added a very large wharf to the Anqing port. The intention is to allow merchant ships without wharves to dock, which can develop commercial shipping in northern Anhui, and increase revenue for the provincial treasury, hence the name "Public Wharf." Upon receiving the news, foreign merchants negotiated with the provincial government on the method of foreign ships docking at the port. The Anhui provincial government has already proposed and approved the use of the wharf to attract foreign ships, and reported it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for record. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has replied with its approval, which has aroused strong opposition from Chinese shipping merchants.</p>
<p>Chinese Shipping Merchants Express Opposition. The first to express opposition were Chinese shipping merchants in Anqing. Their reason is that Anqing has never allowed foreign ships to dock. If they are allowed to dock, it will not only result in the loss of national sovereignty but also allow foreign ships to encroach on and exclude the barely surviving Chinese shipping industry. They also telegraphed Shanghai Chinese shipping companies to rise up and provide assistance. It is reported that various Chinese shipping companies in Shanghai have also expressed strong opposition to this case and have submitted petitions to the national government and the Ministry of Transportation, requesting the Anhui authorities to revoke the approval of foreign ships docking at the port, in order to maintain national sovereignty and protect the business of Chinese merchants.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Public Bus</h3>
<p>Strike Resolved Yesterday</p>
<p>Still Using Chinese Drivers, Full Resumption of Work Today, According to Workers</p>
<p>The public bus workers' strike, which lasted for nearly a month, was completely resolved yesterday after signing eight terms and conditions. Full resumption of work is scheduled for today. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiation Process. After the tram strike, the company once asked the police to mediate, but the negotiation broke down because the company refused to pay wages for the strike period. After another round of mediation by representatives for three days, the company announced at a mass rally in Shen Garden Dog Racing Field the day before yesterday that it accepted the conditions. Although dissatisfaction was expressed regarding the unpaid wages during the strike period, the police detectives present only whispered to each other and ended the rally. Yesterday, the three representatives of buses No. 80, 36, and 37 officially signed the agreement.</p>
<p>Terms of Resumption. The conditions announced at the assembly are as follows: (1) A general wage increase of three yuan; (2) Safety bonus: one yuan in the first month, two yuan in the second month, six yuan in the third month, for a total of forty-eight yuan per year; (3) Wages will be paid during training at the school; (4) All drivers have the opportunity to train to drive new cars; (5) Employees are not allowed to be fired within three months of resuming work; (6) A subsidy of fifteen yuan per month is provided during the training period for new drivers; (7) After receiving the permit, new drivers will receive a minimum monthly wage of twenty-five yuan; (8) Bonuses will be discussed again after one year.</p>
<p>Assembly This Morning. This morning at 7:00 am, all the people gathered at the Shen Garden Dog Racing Field to hold a celebration assembly. After the meeting, they gathered in a procession and marched into the company, setting off firecrackers along the way, creating a lively scene.</p>
<p>Strengthen Solidarity. To guarantee the conditions in the future, it is also necessary to strengthen the power of solidarity. Therefore, the club is actively organizing and participating in the water and electricity joint council to unite the power of the entire water and electricity workers' class to provide a strong guarantee for the conditions. News from the Company</p>
<p>Wenhui Bao reported that today (13th), according to an official from the Public Bus Company in the Public Concession, the labor unrest in the company was resolved satisfactorily between labor and management this morning. All buses on all routes will fully resume operations tomorrow morning (14th). All issues have been resolved between the company and the strike representatives today. It seems that the buses driven by Russian drivers during the strike will still be driven by Chinese drivers.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Tram Strike</h3>
<p>Renegotiation Today</p>
<p>Considerable Hope for Resolution</p>
<p>After the resumption of work by the tram workers in the Public Concession was suspended the day before yesterday, although a few workers at the old station did not receive the news of the continuation of the strike yesterday and went to work at the station in the early morning, the vehicles were intercepted by hundreds of workers as soon as they departed. Tram No. 2 was not immediately intercepted by the striking workers because it departed earlier, so a small number of workers were forced to drive for a day. However, those who drove were not unemployed workers. Seeing that the strike was about to be resolved, the unemployed workers made a proposal to the company for follow-up measures, but it was rejected by the manager. The workers immediately went to a place in western Shanghai and convened a meeting of more than 200 unemployed workers, and unanimously passed (1) a declaration (2) sending someone to the club's strike committee to contact and request full participation in the strike committee. Hearing the news, the committee immediately sent representatives to contact the unemployed workers, welcoming them to join the club and fight together. The strike committee has now agreed with the company representatives to negotiate conditions at 1:00 pm today at Zhang Guisheng's place in the Central Hotel on Hubei Road, Wuma Road, and at the same time notified all workers to gather there to await the results.</p>
<p>Ma Fuan, who was detained the day before yesterday, was sent to the Special District Local Court by the police yesterday morning. Judge Ge Zhitan interrogated him. According to the police report, the defendant had blocked as many as five trams from operating at the time, so he was arrested. When asked why he did this, the defendant said that the company had agreed to increase wages for drivers selling tickets, but the coppersmiths had not yet been resolved, so he did this. He should be questioned. Judge Ge then questioned Ma, who firmly denied obstructing the vehicle, saying that he was mistakenly arrested because he was passing by on his way home. He also hired attorney Fan Gang to defend him, while the tram company sent a Westerner to court to state that the defendant had been serving for many years and was fairly well-behaved. After the interrogation, Judge Ge sentenced Ma Fuan to a fine of thirty yuan. If he was unable to pay, he was allowed to commute it to one day of imprisonment at the rate of two yuan per day.</p>
<h3>Baoshan County Opens Rice Sale at Fixed Price</h3>
<p>Wu Jia, the magistrate of Baoshan County, considers that the current rice prices are increasing and the livelihoods of the poor are worrying. Therefore, he specially convened a meeting of the chiefs of the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth districts to discuss measures for selling rice at a fixed price. It is learned that the first district started yesterday. The measures are recorded as follows: (1) The period for selling rice at a fixed price is limited to 50 days; (2) Only residents in the district who are truly poor are eligible; (3) The time for selling rice at a fixed price is from 8:00 am to 12:00 pm every day; (4) The locations for selling rice at a fixed price are divided into two locations: (A) the first district office; (B) the Yangxing Grain Storage; (5) The standard for selling rice at a fixed price is one sheng per person (half for children); (6) The district office will issue certificates to poor households and issue them on a daily basis to purchase rice and stamp them with a seal. Yesterday, because there were too many poor people buying rice, it was extremely crowded, so Director Shen of the County Public Security Bureau sent police to take care of them to avoid trouble. It is reported that other districts will also open gradually.</p>
<h3>Five Chinese Directors of the Municipal Council Take Office Today</h3>

Because the Municipal Council meeting is very important, they returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday to prepare to attend the meeting. Bei Songsun, who is in Shanghai for his wife's funeral, will also take the time to attend. Therefore, all five Chinese directors, including Xu Xinliu, can go to the bureau to take office when the meeting is held.

I have been investigating that Mu Bin, the former director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government, acted arbitrarily during his tenure, resulting in a fierce reputation, so the things that the party departments and civil groups of the counties presented and controlled are heard every day, and the newspapers are the mouthpiece of the people, and of course, they should expose them as much as possible, but Mu Bin did not know that he should reflect on himself, and actually entrusted Wu Guanli, the main cadre of the Wuxi Xibao Museum, to come to Shanghai to bribe the newspapers with 8,000 yuan in the hope of buying them off. This matter was published in detail in the Songjiang Dagong Bao Min Bao on April 13th and 14th, which can be used to obtain evidence, resulting in a social outcry, which is considered a strange shame in party governance. If no sanctions are given, how can the group be released from doubts and the law and discipline be extended? Therefore, the 12th meeting of the Association resolved to present it to the Commission for consideration and approval, and please transfer it to the Commission for verification and handling, which is really a matter of party convenience.</p>

<h3>City Publicity Department Publicity Meeting</h3>
<p>Third Time</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Department Publicity Department convened the third Municipal Publicity Meeting on May 11, which was presided over by Chen Dezheng, Director of the Municipal Publicity Department. After the meeting was held in an orderly manner, the chairman first reported that today is the third Municipal Publicity Meeting, and there are several things to report to everyone: (1) In the future, we should attach importance to universal publicity work. In the past, publicity work was too focused on the upper level, and in the future, we should determine a plan and work together. Recently, the publicity work in this city has been more effective. From the statistics, the work effect in the past month is actually more advanced than in the past. The investigation of reactionary elements in various districts is also extremely diligent. In the future, I hope that comrades will never neglect negative work; (2) The items decided at the last publicity meeting have all been implemented. For example, the outline of the revolutionary theater company plan has been drafted and will be established soon. The current situation is quite similar to the time when the Northern Expeditionary Army first launched, the difference is that in the past it was a warlord government, today it is a revolutionary government, in the past it was a majority of revolutionary comrades attacking the dark forces of the anti-revolutionary pseudo-government, today it is a small part of the anti-revolutionary forces betraying the revolutionary government, but the result is the same, the progress of the revolutionary forces is curvilinear, and the elimination of the anti-revolutionary forces in any way is inevitable. In the future, comrades should still strive to improve their propaganda work. If they do not work hard, the general public with shallow political views will inevitably be confused, so in addition to negative work, it is even more difficult to pay attention to positive work, to review themselves and create a great popular spirit to extinguish all reactionary forces; (4) The reconnaissance team is negative work, and I hope that a positive work principle can be decided today. Then Xu Xingchu, the director of the guidance section, reported (1) in the past, negative work should be more positive work in the future; (2) the strength of the revolutionary theater companies in various districts is weak, so it is planned to combine the strength of the districts to form a complete theater company, the name of the theater company has not been determined; (3) we must actively strive for the literary and artistic construction of the Three People's Principles. The guidance section plans to conduct a survey first, and the literary and artistic groups plan to complete it on July 1; (4) the working committees of the May Revolution Anniversary have been fully launched by comrades in the section to inspect and hope that the publicity committees of the districts will answer as much as possible; (2) please hand in the forms on time and they must be clear and detailed; (3) the four, five and six-day work plan and itinerary of the section have been drafted and are ready; (4) the headquarters has recently drafted more than ten measures to resist cultural aggression and hopes to work together to urge the central government to push for its success. Then the publicity committees of the districts reported one after another, and then began to discuss the resolutions as follows: (1) how should the regular publications in each district be reorganized and improved? It was resolved to request the Municipal Publicity Department to issue an order to the publicity committees of each district to draft a plan for the improvement of the regular publications in each district within one week and submit it to the Municipal Publicity Department for review; (2) should the publicity meetings in each district make effective use of the activity plan of the district publicity meetings? It was resolved to request the Municipal Publicity Department to issue an order to each district to follow it, and order the publicity committees of each district to prepare fully in advance; (3) in the future, publicity materials should strive to be more artistic? It was resolved to request the Municipal Publicity Department to handle it; (4) each district should hold costume speeches at any time? It was resolved to request the Municipal Publicity Department to issue an order to each district to comply with it; (5) the punitive army has been fighting on the front line, and the reactionary propaganda reconnaissance team in this city should work tightly to maintain security in the rear? It was resolved to request the Municipal Publicity Department to issue an order to each district to comply with it; (6) Indian revolutionary leader Gandhi was arrested, and each district should support him? It was resolved to have the party departments in each district send letters to Gandhi to express their condolences and encouragement; (7) each district should send personnel to attend the memorial meetings of each secondary or higher school on each revolutionary anniversary? It was resolved (1) to request the Municipal Publicity Department to issue an order to each district to comply with it; (2) to request the Municipal Publicity Department to issue an order to each secondary or higher school to notify the Municipal Publicity Department or the local party department three days before the opening of the memorial meeting to request the dispatch of personnel for guidance; (8) the defense of imperialist cultural aggression? It was resolved to pass according to the original plan, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Two Groups Go to Heji</h3>
<p>Since the German Industrial Group and the German Baoye Inspection Group went to Hankou for inspection, they have already returned east on the Jianghua Wheel. When they arrived in Nanjing on the 10th, they landed in Nanjing. The group will return to Shanghai soon.

<h3>Yin Xin Nong, Family Member of the May 30th Massacre Victims</h3>
<p>Application to Register Martyr Yin Jingyi</p>
<p>Previously, the Family Association of Martyrs of the May 30th Massacre in Shanghai learned that the family member of the martyred national hero Yin Jingyi, Yin Xin Nong, is currently the Director of Puji Hospital of the Qingdao Special Municipality Health Bureau. A letter was sent to Mr. Yin, requesting that he immediately submit proof of his younger brother, the martyr Yin Jingyi's sacrifice, to the Association for registration. Yesterday, the Association received a reply from Yin Xin Nong applying for registration. His letter reads: Upon receiving your esteemed letter, I was deeply moved. The May 30th Massacre should have been addressed by the government negotiating with the British authorities for compensation to the families. However, due to international inequality and various other reasons, the government was unable to handle it promptly, and the matter was left unresolved. I have been heartbroken for years. In previous years, while in Beijing, I repeatedly petitioned central figures, but the matter was deemed too complex and had to be temporarily shelved. I occasionally saw reports about the Family Association initiated by comrades, but their focus seemed to be primarily on resolving the current difficulties of the families, which is not my most urgent concern. Due to busy schedules and long distances, I was unable to come to register. Furthermore, both my brother and I are Party members and deeply understand that the May 30th Massacre was essentially a patriotic movement to awaken the masses through personal sacrifice, and a prelude to the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army. It has significant value for the progress of the nation, which cannot be compensated by mere compensation or consolation. However, the deceased are gone, and the living must endure. The only way is to ensure that the case remains eternally in the hearts of the people, awaiting a satisfactory resolution from the government to comfort our grief. The comrades have been running and appealing for this cause, enduring great hardships. Especially Comrades Hu and Chen, who are physically disabled but persistently strive with all their might. I deeply admire their efforts. Regarding the compensation received for my late brother Jingyi's sacrifice, I originally did not want to accept it. However, to comfort his spirit due to the tragic nature of his death, I sought recognition from the government. Last year, I contacted Mr. Chen Guofu of the Central Committee, but it has not yet been arranged (Mr. Chen's reply is attached). I also plan to establish a memorial school in my hometown to perpetuate his memory, using the compensation as part of the school's foundation. Now, receiving the comrades' notice, I feel even more compelled to act. I am enclosing a photo of Jingyi and two copies of the "Painful History of Martyrdom" that I wrote at the time. Please verify them. I have also entrusted my cousin Yin Zhongshu to come to collect the funds. Please hand them over to him in full. After my late brother's tragic death, my cousin Zhongshu and his father managed everything related to the coffin, burial, and subsequent interment in the May 30th Public Cemetery. My late brother's books and belongings are still stored at their place. Therefore, my cousin Zhongshu is very familiar with the circumstances surrounding my late brother's death. The so-called 'Chen Baocong, my classmate,' mentioned in the letter, is the person whom my late brother rescued before his death, as detailed in the 'Painful History of Martyrdom.' He can be consulted. My cousin Zhongshu can handle the procedures for receiving the funds. Due to my public service duties, I am unable to come to Shanghai to mourn with the comrades in person, and I feel extremely sorry. I hope you will understand and forgive me. I will send my photo and writings later. I respectfully reply to the Shanghai Family Association of Martyrs of the May 30th Massacre and wish you all well. Sincerely, Yin Xin Nong, elder brother of Yin Jingyi, martyr of the May 30th Massacre. Printed: One portrait of Yin Jingyi, two copies of 'Painful History of Martyrdom,' one reply letter from Mr. Chen Guofu. Original letter from Mr. Chen Guofu to Mr. Yin Xin Nong: Mr. Xin Nong, upon receiving your letter, I have read the attached 'Painful History of Martyrdom' and newspaper clippings. You can contact Mr. Ye directly about the matter. I will not reply further. I wish you well. Chen Guofu, June 10th, 1939. The Family Association, based on the letter and the verbal account of Yin Zhongshu, immediately registered the case and, according to procedures, provided a guarantor and issued the compensation funds. It is said that there are slightly more families waiting for registration and the procedures will be followed to issue the compensation funds.</p>

<h3>A Murder Case Over a Zhongshan Suit</h3>
<p>Disagreement over Style Leads to Tragedy; Whistle Blows, Workers Rush In, Iron Gate Closes; Victim Drowns, Gun is Fired, Culprits Apprehended</p>
<p>Jiang Tanghua, a coppersmith foreman from Ningbo working at the Cairo Coal Ball Company in Rihui Port, was introduced by his sister-in-law Huang Kehui to Wang Fangcheng, a local tailor who runs a Western-style clothing store, to have a Zhongshan suit made. A price of 25 yuan for labor and materials was agreed upon on the spot. When the suit was finished, Jiang suddenly claimed that the style was not suitable and the fit was not right, so he decided he didn't want it. Wang, concerned that the custom-made suit would be difficult to sell elsewhere, went to Jiang's workplace around noon the day before yesterday with Huang Kehui and friends Zhang Genfa and Lin Along to negotiate.</p>
<p>Iron Gate Closes, Violent Beating Begins; After some discussion, they disagreed and a dispute arose. Jiang blew a whistle, and dozens of workers rushed out from the company. Jiang then ordered the iron gate of the company to be closed and suddenly surrounded Wang and his companions, launching a violent attack. Wang and his friends were outnumbered and were knocked to the ground and subjected to kicks and punches.</p>
<p>In Desperation, Victim Jumps into Huangpu River; Lin Along suffered injuries to his head and left temple. Realizing that they could not withstand the attack and looking for a way to escape, they saw that the factory was surrounded by water on three sides, with only one side leading to land. With the iron gate closed, there was no way out. In desperation, Lin Along jumped into the river, hoping to swim away to avoid the violence. However, Lin could not swim well and immediately sank after entering the water.</p>
<p>Zhang Genfa Survives by Chance; In the midst of the chaos, Zhao, an officer from the third squad of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's water patrol team, heard the commotion. He immediately dispatched patrol leader Zhao Xiwu and officers Su Guangxiao, Shi Liangchen, and Lu Zhiqing to investigate. The workers, upon seeing the police, remained aggressive. Zhang Genfa took the opportunity to jump into the river, hoping to escape. The officers jumped into the water and managed to rescue him.</p>
<p>A Shot Fired to Disperse the Crowd; Unable to resolve the situation, officer Zhao Xiwu fired a shot into the air. Upon hearing the gunshot, the workers scattered. Wang and his companions were rescued, and the assailants Jiang Tanghua, Zhao Daicai, Shi Linfu, Shi Shigen, and Shi Weiguang were apprehended along with iron bars and other weapons and taken back to the squad. After an hour, Lin Along's body was retrieved from the river. He had died from a combination of severe injuries and drowning.</p>
<p>Foreman Still Insists on Being Right; After questioning Jiang and others, the officer determined that Wang Fangcheng was the most severely injured and his life was in danger. Zhang Genfa accompanied him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. The others were taken to the Nanshi Headquarters. During the preliminary interrogation by Squad Leader Xu, Jiang, 26 years old, claimed that the Zhongshan suit he had ordered from Wang did not fit properly, so he refused to take it. Wang and others had asked him to meet them on the 9th to settle the matter, but he was too busy. When Wang and others came to his workplace today, they demanded 50 yuan in compensation, leading to the conflict. Zhao Daicai and others also admitted to helping Jiang in the fight.</p>
<p>The Coroner of the District Court Believes Jiang and Others Acted Brazenly; The coroner of the District Court believed that Jiang and others dared to rely on their numbers and engage in a violent fight, resulting in death. Even when the police arrived to suppress the situation, they did not stop, which was extremely heinous. He requested that Prosecutor Lei of the District Court come to the scene to determine that Lin Along died from his injuries. Documents were submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Third Section for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Liren Company Sued for Excessive Rent</h3>
<p>Tenant Signs Lease First, Landlord Fills in Rent Amount; Point of Contention Lies Therein; Judge Repeatedly Encourages Settlement, to No Avail</p>
<p>The Liren Company in Lujiabang, Nanshi, has recently rebuilt over fifty houses on the road. The rents are divided into 30 yuan, 20 yuan, and 16 yuan. Several tenants, including Zhang Shizhou, Yang Xiaofang, and Zhu Guisheng, filed a complaint, arguing that the excessive rent was a matter of public concern. The Social Bureau ordered the company to revise the lease and scheduled a mediation for both parties. Cao Jinchun, the manager of the company, hired lawyer Shen Xingxia to file a petition with the District Court, requesting confirmation that the lease was valid. The defendants, Zhang Shizhou and others, hired lawyer Wei Wenhan to file a defense. The case has been heard twice without a conclusion. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Chen held another hearing to continue the trial. Fifty or sixty spectators crowded the courtroom. Both parties appeared in court with their lawyers. The plaintiff, Cao Jinchun, claimed that the company filled in the rent amount and then the tenants signed the lease. The defendants claimed that the tenants signed the lease first, and then the landlord filled in the amount. The dispute continued for a long time. The judge repeatedly tried to mediate, but the parties were too extreme, making it difficult to reach an agreement. The debate began. The plaintiff's lawyer, Shen, argued that once a contract is established, the rights and obligations in private law are bound by its content. In this case, the defendants, Zhang Shizhou and others, acknowledged signing the lease with the plaintiff. Since the lease was not coerced or forged by the plaintiff, the rent amount is part of the lease and cannot be changed simply because the defendants and their agents claimed that the plaintiff filled it in later. Furthermore, although current laws prohibit the collection of small rents, there is no explicit order stating that collecting small rents invalidates the lease. Moreover, the plaintiff in this case did not collect small rents from the tenants, so it cannot affect the lease itself. The defendant's lawyer, Wei, argued that the defendants signed blank leases, and the monthly rent was filled in after the signature was obtained. Also, collecting small rents violates the law. After hearing the arguments, the judge set a date for sentencing at 2 PM on the 16th.</p>
<h3>Security Guard Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>"Death is due to unavoidable circumstances."</p>
<p>Mysterious Note Left Behind</p>
<p>Rumored to be Caused by Fiancée Having Another Lover</p>
<p>Unable to Recover, He Committed Suicide in Anger</p>
<p>Xu Rongtang, 44 years old, a local resident living at No. 35 Xisujiajiao, Caojiadu, Shanghai West, ran a Rongji Construction Factory. He started as a gardener and was considered a middle-class family. His wife, Chen, had two sons from a previous marriage. The eldest son, Guobang (also known as Zhang Sheng), was in his twenties, and the younger son was about ten years old. Since his eldest son was of age, Xu had arranged a marriage for him last year with a woman surnamed Mou, planning to hold the wedding next year. Guobang used to work at the Toyota Cotton Mill, but he quit shortly after and is now a member of the Second Team of the Thirteenth Branch of the Songhu Security Corps in Fahuaxiang, possessing a five-shot rifle which he kept at home. Unexpectedly, at around 7:30 PM the night before last (the 12th), while the family was preparing dinner, a loud bang was suddenly heard from Guobang's room. Rongtang rushed in and saw his eldest son Guobang lying face up on the bed with the rifle across his body, a bullet wound in his chest. He died instantly. The family, hearing the sound, rushed over and found that Guobang had committed suicide by pointing the loaded rifle at his chest while sitting on the edge of the bed. There were traces of blood on the muzzle and his clothes. Only a note was left on the table, which read, "Death is due to unavoidable circumstances." His parents did not know why he committed suicide. However, it was rumored that his fiancée, whom his father had arranged, now had another lover working at the Toyota Factory. He had repeatedly tried to resolve the situation but was unable to, leading to the suicide. Yesterday, his father, Rongtang, reported the incident to the Sixth District Police Station. Tan Hefu, the local headman, also reported to the District Court, requesting exemption from an inquest.</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition of Abandoning Infants' Corpses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Public Security Bureau, upon the order of the Municipal Government, consulted with the Health Bureau to discuss the Sixth District Party Department's request to strictly prohibit the abandonment of infants' corpses and specify penalties. It was determined that abandoning infants' corpses not only endangers public health but is also immoral. An order was issued to all districts to strictly investigate and prohibit the act. Regarding the Sixth District Party Department's request to specify penalties, Article 262 of the current Criminal Law stipulates that those who damage, abandon, defile, or steal corpses shall be sentenced to imprisonment for six months to five years. Since it does not specify or limit the corpses to those of adults, it should include infants' corpses. Therefore, those who abandon infants' corpses have violated the criminal law and can be sent to the court to be punished according to the severity of their circumstances, according to this law. It is not appropriate to establish separate penalties to avoid conflicts. The Health Bureau was consulted and reported to the Municipal Government. The order No. 5200 stated that the report was approved as proposed. Therefore, Director Yuan yesterday also issued a proclamation jointly with the Health Bureau and ordered his subordinates that, if abandoned infants' corpses or coffins are discovered, they should notify nearby charitable organizations to transport them to the public cemetery for burial. At the same time, they should investigate the person who abandoned the corpse and hand them over to the court for punishment in order to deter others.</p>

<h3>Change of General Manager at Rihua Cotton Mill</h3>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Requests Prevention of Thieves Stealing Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Public Concession's Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that, according to a letter from the Shanghai Transportation Association, the Dingtong Company and others have reported that on the 9th of this month, one of their rickshaw pullers, Zhou Guilin, was transporting a cart of ramie cloth sent by the Nanhai Wheel. At around 10:30 AM, while passing the south end of the Second White Bridge, he was suddenly stopped by several armed thugs who used knives to cut open the cloth bags and stole 18 pieces of ramie cloth, causing a loss of approximately 150 yuan. Although a police report was filed and the thugs were pursued, they had already escaped. The Huashengyi Company also reported that on April 30th, at 3:00 PM, a box of mahjong tile blanks sent from Suzhou was instructed to be delivered to a merchant. Unexpectedly, while passing the top of the Tianhou Bridge, thugs forcibly cut open the outer burlap bag with knives and stole 35 pairs of mahjong tile blanks, causing a loss of approximately 194 yuan. The Tongxing Company also reported that on the 7th of this month, at 10:00 AM, a cart carrying rubber shoes was also stopped while passing the Tianhou Palace Bridge. Fortunately, the guard on duty pursued and apprehended them on the spot, and they were handed over to the police station to be prosecuted by the court. Such daytime armed robberies are a flagrant disregard for the law. If swift action is not taken to stop them, what will be the extent of the merchants' losses? Therefore, we are writing to request that your association forward this request to the Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association to forward it to the concession authorities. They should increase the number of detectives patrolling the above bridges and roads at all times to prevent robberies and protect merchants' goods, which would be a public service." After investigating, our association found that robberies of merchants' goods by thugs on the above bridges have been happening from time to time. These thugs dared to arbitrarily rob goods in broad daylight in busy areas where patrols are present, which is extremely illegal. If effective prevention and strict investigation are not carried out, how can future incidents be deterred and commerce be secured? Therefore, we are writing to respectfully request that your association consider the difficulties of merchants and request the various concession police stations to strictly investigate and prosecute, and increase the number of detectives patrolling the above bridges and roads at all times to protect merchants' goods and deter thugs. We express our sincere appreciation. This letter is addressed to the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau Revises Regulations for Examining Automobile Driver's Licenses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau previously established regulations for managing automobile drivers. Article 8 stipulates that automobile drivers should submit their licenses to the Public Utilities Bureau for examination once every year from the date of issuance, paying a fee of one yuan each time. The Public Utilities Bureau may also order the driver to provide a new photo to be affixed to the license if necessary. If the license is found to be damaged, a new license should be issued, with a fee of one yuan per copy. The Bureau now considers that the wording of the article is not appropriate. The reasons are: (1) The license examination period is calculated from the date of issuance, deducting one full year, which is intended to be fair. However, in practice, this date of issuance is often difficult to remember, and the office hours of the agency are similar to the service hours of the drivers, making it difficult for them to find time to submit the license for examination. According to Article 9 of the same regulations, failure to do so is subject to penalties, which seems overly restrictive. (2) The main purpose of examining drivers' licenses is to check whether their physical condition is still suitable for driving a car. Otherwise, the license should be revoked to ensure traffic safety. However, this article does not clearly stipulate this. Therefore, it was submitted to the Municipal Government to amend Article 8 as follows: "Automobile driver's licenses will be examined once a year from April 1st to June 30th, with a fee of one yuan each time. Those who obtained their licenses before June 30th of each year are exempt from examination during the current year's examination period. The Public Utilities Bureau may take the following actions based on the results of the examination: (1) If the driver's physical condition is not suitable for driving a car, such as impaired vision or unsoundness of hands or feet, the license will be revoked. (2) If the driver's appearance has changed, such as growing a beard after being clean-shaven, and the current appearance is different from the original photo on the license, the driver will be ordered to provide a recent photo.

<h3>Academic Lecture at the YMCA</h3>
<p>Liu Dajun Speaks on China's Industrial Problems</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the local YMCA held its tenth academic lecture. Dr. Liu Dajun was invited to speak on China's industrial problems, with the topic "The Industrial Revolution and China." Mr. Xu Zhi served as the stenographer. Approximately 200 people attended the lecture. A summary of the content of his speech is as follows: (A) Characteristics of the European Industrial Revolution: (1) Use of steam and other power sources to manufacture goods; (2) Mass production. (B) Industrial Revolution and Capital: (1) Capital plays an important role in new industries. To develop industry, capital is indispensable. (2) The so-called regulation of capital is not the regulation of capital itself, but the regulation of capitalism. (3) The reason for the slow development of Chinese industry is that there is little capital and a large number of workers. (4) The standard wage for Chinese workers is 15 yuan per month, while in the United States it is more than 200 yuan, and workers' investment is very developed because the United States has a lot of capital and a small number of workers. (C) Reasons for the Lack of Industrial Capital in China: (1) High interest rates on loans from banks, usually 1% per month. In inland areas without banks, the rate can be as high as 2% or 3%. (2) Banks are unwilling to lend to industry because the financial turnover in industry is not as flexible as in commerce, and it is difficult to repay the loan in a short period of time. (3) The operation of the stock exchange is imperfect. (4) Company shareholders have no responsibility, and bonds have no special guarantee, which has become an obstacle to investment. (D) Chinese Industry and International Trade: (1) Both free trade and protectionist policies have their advantages. (2) The limited economic aggression is a kind of oppression by various countries against domestic producers and consumers in China. (3) To promote domestic goods, the first step is to improve the quality of domestic goods.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau Brings Back Detained Prisoners</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Public Security Bureau previously transferred 65 reactionary prisoners detained in the Concession to the County Government for detention because the number of prisoners transferred to the Bureau from the Concession was too large and the Bureau's detention facilities were insufficient. Yesterday, Director Yuan of the Bureau ordered detectives to go to the County Government detention facilities to bring back 34 prisoners for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Printing Press of the Revolutionary Daily</h3>
<p>Printing Press Searched by Police Yesterday; Evidence Destroyed</p>
<p>The printer of the Revolutionary Daily was initially unknown to outsiders. Until yesterday morning at 1:00 AM, the Songhu Garrison Command sent personnel to cooperate with Chief Detective Pan Linshi of the Political Department of the General Police Station and other detectives to apprehend Zhou Amao, a peddler selling the newspaper, in Room 15 of the Zhongnan Inn on Avenue Edward VII. Zhou Amao confessed that the newspaper was printed by Ruiwen Printing Press at 215 Avenue Petain. Detectives were dispatched to search the premises. Upon arriving at the printing press, they found the doors tightly closed. After knocking for over twenty minutes, the door was finally opened. The detectives searched the premises and found piles of paper ash in the well and stove, which were likely the remains of destroyed reactionary printed materials. They only found a few copies of the Revolutionary Daily and one copy of the Honglie Bao, along with two printing plates and several blank printing plates. They took back the printing press workers and apprentices Wang Shidong, Jiang Yunjie, Gao Zhide, Gao Shiliang, Jiang Jiuliu, Huang Jichen, Liu Wenhui, Hang Qinghe, Fang Zhongliang, Yin Mingshan, and Zhou Amao, a total of ten people, to the police station at 9:00 AM. They were handed over to Judge Sun Yuan of the Special District District Court for interrogation. Officials from the Garrison Command went to court to request the transfer of the prisoners. After questioning, Judge Sun granted the request to transfer the prisoners. The printing equipment from the printing press was ordered to be sealed by the police station and stored in the warehouse. Except for the copy of the Honglie Bao, which was kept on file for reference, all the seized evidence was handed over to the personnel from the Garrison Command to be processed.</p>
<h3>Litigation Between Two Bookstores</h3>
<p>The Court Hopes Both Parties Will Reconcile in the Copyright Infringement Case of Kaiming Bookstore Against Asia Bookstore</p>
<p>The Asia Bookstore, located at No. 72 Qinglian Lane, Qipan Street, published the book "Selected Modern Chinese Novels" last year. The book's content is a collection of excerpts from famous authors, totaling forty-five articles. Many schools, both large and small, across the country have adopted it as Chinese teaching material, resulting in brisk sales. Kaiming Bookstore hired a lawyer to sue them in the Special District Local Court for publishing a pirated version and infringing on copyright, requesting an injunction, etc. Tang Jianwu, the manager of Asia Bookstore, also hired lawyers Jiang Rong and Xu Shihao to defend the case. They argued that although the defendant's published book "Selected Chinese Novels" consisted of excerpts from famous authors, it clearly indicated the source of each excerpt. Article 28 of the Copyright Law stipulates that excerpting from multiple authors to create a book for reference, with clear indication of sources, does not constitute copyright infringement. The plaintiff's lawsuit stemmed from jealousy towards the defendant for not joining the trade association. Furthermore, the "Living Leaf Anthology" published by the plaintiff, Kaiming Bookstore, also contains excerpts from other authors' works. Other bookstores have also published similar selected and printed books. It is unfair for the plaintiff to nitpick only on the defendant. They requested the court to dismiss the original lawsuit and order the plaintiff to bear the litigation costs. The court hearing was held yesterday morning by Judge Ying Shi. After mutual debate between the lawyers of both parties, Judge Ying suggested that both parties are engaged in promoting culture, so why should they engage in infighting? He advised them to reconcile. The defendant's lawyer immediately stated that the plaintiff's purpose in suing was to require the defendant to join the association. Now that the defendant is willing to join the association, the case can be easily resolved if the plaintiff voluntarily withdraws the charges. Judge Ying further advised the plaintiff's lawyer that the outcome of this case is still unknown. Even if the plaintiff wins in the future, the plaintiff also publishes selected and printed books, and it is hard to guarantee that a third party will not come out and sue the plaintiff. Therefore, a reconciliation would be the best outcome for this case. Two weeks are set as the time limit for both parties to persuade their clients to make concessions. If a reconciliation is definitely impossible, another hearing will be scheduled.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Bribery Accusations Against Police Detective</h3>
<p>Proven Innocent Through Multiple Testimonies; Acquittal Announced After Yesterday's Trial</p>
<p>Based on the testimony of a brothel madam named Liu Yu-shi, the Old Gate Police Department filed a lawsuit against Zhao Rongsheng, a Chinese detective with badge number 151, for accepting bribes. Yesterday morning, Xu Jia-shi, the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court, and Zhou Xianjue, the Chief Prosecutor, specially opened the First Court to hear the case. Gan Jingxian, the police department's lawyer, presented the case, stating that on the 3rd of this month, the court approved the request from the Changzhou official and issued a warrant, ordering judicial police officer Mai Kai-du and police officer Zhen A-yi to assist Zhao Rongsheng of the Old Gate Police Department in arresting Yuan Wu-shi at No. 266 Derun Lane, Guangxi Road. Yuan Wu-shi is the wife of Yuan Shi-gen. She had previously escaped to Shanghai after being involved in a case and worked as a prostitute at Liu Yu-shi's place at No. 266 Guangxi Road. Her husband, Yuan Shi-gen, discovered her and the Changzhou Local Court sent a document to this court to have her arrested. On the morning of the 4th, Liu Yu-shi and Shao Lao-wu were arrested for quarreling on Guangxi Road. Liu Yu-shi claimed that Shao Lao-wu had extorted 50 yuan from her. The police department then sued Liu Yu-shi for selling a free woman into prostitution and Shao Lao-wu for extortion. However, during the court hearing, Liu Yu-shi suddenly accused Chinese detective Zhao Rongsheng of demanding bribes. The police department then filed a public lawsuit. According to police officer Mai Kai-du, Zhao detective did not leave his side at the time, so there was no opportunity to accept bribes. All witnesses have arrived today and are ready to be questioned. Defendant Zhao Rongsheng testified that after the two police officers Mai and Zhen arrived at the police station, the chief detective ordered him to go with them. The address written on the document was No. 366, but after searching Derun Lane, there was no No. 366. They then asked at No. 266. The front door of the house was closed, so they entered through the back door, first going to Shao Lao-wu's room downstairs and asking if Shao was Liu Quan-sheng (i.e., Liu Yu-shi's husband). Shao replied no and said that someone with the surname Liu might be living upstairs. They went upstairs and met Liu. Liu admitted that he was Liu Quan-sheng. There were five women in the room, and some were sleeping with guests. He then asked where Liu Er-bao (i.e., Yuan Wu-shi) was. Liu replied that she was on Xiaoshadu Road. He ordered Liu to accompany them to find her. At the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Ma Huo Road, Liu asked if there would be any implications for him if he handed over Er-bao. He replied no. After Liu read the document, he said that Er-bao was actually on Guangxi Road, not Xiaoshadu Road. They returned by car to Guangxi Road, where Liu ordered his wife to find Er-bao and bring her back. They took her back to the police station. The two police officers did not leave his side at any time during the two trips to Guangxi Road. How could he have accepted bribes? Liu Yu-shi said that he went to demand money again on the afternoon of the 4th, but he can provide evidence to prove that he was in a clock store on Nanjing Road that afternoon, talking with the shopkeeper for a long time. Furthermore, Liu Yu-shi did not mention that he had extorted her when she was detained at the police station, etc. Police officer Mai Kai-du testified that everything was generally the same as Zhao's statement, but he said that he did not enter the second time he went to Guangxi Road, but stood at the entrance of the lane. Police officer Zhen Xue-yi testified that he did not leave Zhao detective's side. When questioned, Liu Yu-shi insisted that Zhao did receive 50 yuan from her at the time, and there was a pawn ticket as evidence. Shao Hong-shi testified. After the judge finished reviewing the evidence, he ordered the debate to begin. Jiang Baoli, Zhao Rongsheng's lawyer, and Ye Fokang, Shao Lao-wu's lawyer, debated for a long time. Liu Yu-shi also hired a lawyer to court, requesting Zhao be severely punished and attaching a civil suit. Judge Xu reviewed the evidence and announced the end of the debate. First, he declared Zhao Rongsheng not guilty. The attached civil lawsuit was dismissed. Liu Yu-shi was returned to custody. Shao Lao-wu was still released on bail of 200 yuan for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Uncle's Affair with Sister-in-Law Unresolved</h3>
<p>Yu Peiting and Yu Peigen from Yangzhou are brothers. Peiting is a farmer, and his wife, Qin, is 38 years old. Peigen is a hat maker. Peiting asked his wife to borrow hundreds of yuan to provide capital for his younger brother to come to Shanghai seven years ago. They rented a building near Zhonghua Xin Road in Zhabei and opened a Yu's Hat Shop, which did fairly well. Peiting, being an outsider to the hat business, relied entirely on his younger brother to manage the business. Peigen was still unmarried. Peiting secretly instructed his wife to seduce his younger brother. Over time, the uncle and sister-in-law committed adultery, cementing Peigen's affection. Peiting died of illness two years ago, and Peigen then formalized his relationship with his sister-in-law, becoming a formal couple. However, Qin is an old, loose woman with a lustful nature and a gambling addiction. Peigen is inherently foolish. Recently, he became filled with anger because his sister-in-law was having an affair with a man named Jia. He went to the French Concession the night before and bought a box of opium. He took it home and swallowed it secretly, intending to commit suicide. Around 1:00 a.m., he began to vomit violently due to the poison. When his sister-in-law saw this, she immediately took him to a nearby hospital for injections and emergency treatment. Fortunately, the discovery was made early, and the opium poisoning was not deep, so he was saved. The police station in charge heard the news and sent officers to investigate.</p>
<h3>Carnal Knowledge of a Virgin: Five Years Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Two Accomplices Imprisoned for One Year Each</p>
<p>Zhang Beishi, a woman residing at No. 17 Fuchang Lane, Xiafei Road in the French Concession, reported that her 14-year-old daughter, Zhang Sifeng, was enticed by Zhou Baosheng, who plays in a military band, along with Tang Tonghua and Zhang Jicheng, on the 4th of this month. She was tricked into going to a hotel in Zhabei, where she was forcibly defiled and then attempted to be sold off. Bao Tan, a detective from the French Concession Police Department, discovered this and arrested Zhou and the others, bringing them and the girl to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the French Court for prosecution. First, Zhang Beishi filed a complaint about her daughter being defiled and abducted by the defendants, requesting a heavy sentence. Zhang Sifeng stated that on the 4th, her mother went out on business. Zhou Binsheng came and tricked her into going out to see a play, then abducted her to a hotel in Zhabei, where he forcibly defiled her. At the time, she intended to scream, but Zhou tied her mouth with a handkerchief, preventing her from making a sound, so she was unable to move and allowed him to defile her. He also took the gold bracelet she was wearing and pawned it for money. When questioned, Zhou Baosheng claimed that he had known the plaintiff since childhood, so he often went to her house to play. He had been in love with Zhang Sifeng since January of last year and had stayed outside with her more than ten times. Zhang Sifeng claimed that she was only defiled by him this time and had not stayed in a hotel with him last year. She was falsely accused. Judge Zhu Cheng angrily said to Zhou, "You have already committed the crime of defiling Sifeng. Now you dare to insult her in court, which is even more egregious!" Tang Tonghua and Zhang Jicheng both testified that on that day, Zhou Baosheng instructed them to go to the plaintiff's house and trick the girl Sifeng out and take her to a hotel in Zhabei. Zhou Baosheng slept in the same bed with Si, and the two of them slept in the same bed. They did not know about the defilement. The rest of the testimony was evasive. The judge sentenced the defendant Zhou Baosheng to five years in the Western Prison for the crime of raping a virgin under the age of sixteen in violation of Article 240 of the Criminal Law. Tang and Zhang were each sentenced to one year to serve as a warning. Zhang Sifeng was handed over to her mother to be taken home.</p>
<h3>Abduction of Woman Leads to Arrest</h3>
<p>Around 2 a.m. yesterday, police officers from the Fourth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei were patrolling the hotels on North Zhejiang Road when they found a man and woman acting suspiciously in room 30 of the Guang'an Hotel. They were arrested and taken to the station. The man was Xu Jinchun, 25 years old, from Shaoxing, working as a coppersmith on Tangshan Road. The woman was Cheng Han-shi, 19 years old, from Ningbo, living at No. 52 Shunxing Lane, Hongzhen. She had been abducted by Xu Jinchun five days prior. Director Yao, based on the testimonies of both parties, sent them to the judicial section for review.</p>

<h3>Record of a Feast Hosted by Yicheng and Yili Companies</h3>
<p>Yicheng Company's Yantai beer, being purely domestic, has long been praised by society.

<h3>New Product of Domestic Paste</h3>
<p>Liming Bookstore, located at Dade Lane, South Chengdu Road in this city, has recently produced a type of paste called "Weiming Paste." It is pure in color and beautifully packaged. The bookstore issued a notice yesterday, urging all sectors to try it. The notice reads: "Dear Sirs, our company, in view of the fact that the Chinese people are competing to admire Westernization, resulting in the rampant influx of foreign goods, even a small item like paste is being imported, causing a leakage of no less than tens of millions of dollars every year. Our company has been researching and improving for more than a year, and has developed a type of paste called 'Weiming Paste.' Because it is made from precious materials, it is pure in color and highly viscous. Moreover, it is refined using chemical methods, so it does not produce foreign odors and does not spoil over time, far surpassing what is sold in the market. Furthermore, its packaging is elegant and suitable for use on the desk. We have long known that you are enthusiastic about promoting domestic products, and we dare to ask you to widely publicize and vigorously promote it. We know that our efforts are insufficient to supplement the national economy, but they are enough to reduce the arrogance of foreign goods. Therefore, we implore you to give your full support to publicize it, not only for the benefit of our company, but also for the future of domestic products."</p>

<h3>A Word of Wisdom: Autumn Water</h3>
<p>When a man falls in love with a woman, he will never argue with her. But when a woman is no longer willing to argue with him, her love is dead.</p>
<p>After marrying a man, there is this advantage: your boyfriend can often come to your house to eat, talk, and have no scruples or taboos.</p>
<p>The yearning of Christians is to go to Rome to admire the relics. The yearning of young men is to get a sweet kiss on the virgin's fragrant lips.</p>
<p>If a wife regards "deep boudoir companionship at night" as her husband's duty, then he will find it painful rather than joyful.</p>
<p>Heat expands and cold contracts: the spring climate opens up the hearts of men, at least enough to accommodate a dozen women. Before marriage, a man puts his heart and soul at her feet. But after marriage, his wife's feet are filled with his troubles.</p>
<p>Love and seasickness are in the same situation. After the initial pain has disappeared, a woman can easily board the sea ship in the surging tide of love again and taste the pain of seasickness.</p>
<p>Men who can be married can be found everywhere like watermelons, but before eating them, you have to cut them open and destroy them.</p>
<p>If you and your wife are walking on the road and you come to the Statue of Liberty, you must not look at it too much, otherwise your wife will suspect you of being unfaithful to her and harbor ill intentions.</p>
<h3>Farewell Gathering for Athletes: Zhi Zhi</h3>
<p>The 9th Far Eastern Games will be held in Tokyo, Japan from the 24th to the 31st of this month. Our country's athletes have decided to train daily without leaving any effort. Recently, the results of the competition with Westerners at sea have been very good. It is expected that our country can win in the two items of football and basketball. Volleyball is also promising. All the athletes will set off for Japan on the 15th. The China National Sports Association specially held a banquet at Xinghualou last Sunday evening to welcome them. There were more than 200 guests, all the athletes, and reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers, gathering together and raising their glasses in a grand occasion. This newspaper has recorded it in detail. The following is a description of its trivia:</p>
<p>Three Educations: Among the guests, Qu Wenliu gave a speech, saying that although I am not an athlete, my body is very strong. I have not been sick for 30 years. Between the words, his attitude was funny and he showed his pride. Then he said, I will not talk about the Three Principles of the People at this moment, but only talk to you about the Three Educations, namely physical education, moral education, and aesthetic education. Everyone must pay attention to the Three Educations to become a healthy youth. His tone was passionate and encouraging.</p>
<p>Musical Performance: The Honolulu Chinese baseball team returned to China this time to represent at the Far Eastern Games. It has strong strength. It has defeated its strong rivals in Shanghai twice and has won the praise of the public. Veterans are extraordinary. However, the group is also good at music. Each brought musical instruments such as violins to perform in Japan. That evening, they also showed their skills to help the elegance. The violin sound was sonorous and the singing was melodious, winning a lot of applause. They also performed the Nanyang Scholar Dance, with light movements and graceful posture, which was praised by the whole audience.</p>
<p>New Prizes: This time, the prizes donated by our country for the Far Eastern Games are very rich. The most valuable ones are four. That evening, they were displayed in the hall. The styles were novel, beautiful, and eye-catching. The chairman explained them one by one, all containing profound meanings. (1) It is Chairman Jiang's nine-story silver tower, worth about 2,000 yuan. The nine stories indicate that the Far Eastern Games have had nine sessions, and one story will be added each time the meeting is held in the future. (2) It is Foreign Minister Wang's large silver shield, worth more than 1,000 yuan. The shield is an ancient Chinese military weapon used to defend against the enemy. (3) It is the large silver cup of the Ministry of Education, representing ancient Chinese culture. (4) It is Song Zhizhi's silver tripod. The tripod has three legs, indicating that the Far Eastern Games are organized by China, Japan, and the Philippines. These prizes are awarded to the winners of the conference. The woman is crying and laughing abnormally.</p>
<p>Now there is a person who, when hearing humorous and delightful things, reveals sadness between her eyebrows, and when encountering miserable and pitiful things, shows her face and contains joy. A woman who laughs when she should laugh but seems to cry, and who does not cry when she should cry but laughs, this kind of abnormal demeanor can always arouse the surprise and ridicule of others. In fact, this is a kind of disease and not an affected person.</p>
<p>There is a woman in Bodix, England who was born with this unfortunate state. According to the doctor's speculation, it is a nervous disorder and there is no way to treat it. This woman is no different from ordinary people except that when she weeps, her eyes are smiling, as if she is happy. When she occasionally shows her face when she is happy, her eyebrows are tightly furrowed, as if she cannot bear the depression. This disease can be said to be a new creation. I wrote it with the "Free Talk".</p>
<p>Two Fresh Flowers: The most eye-catching female athletes are the Lee sisters, two female tennis players from overseas Chinese in Java. One is named Apricot Blossom and the other is named Peony. Both have amazing skills and have won championships in Java. They are very hopeful to represent their motherland in the Far Eastern Games this time. That evening, Peony wore a white dress and Apricot Blossom wore a light yellow dress and a black vest. Their dignified appearance made them the most outstanding talents among the female athletes.</p>
<h3>Memory of Reading Paintings at the Wei Xue Lu: Nong</h3>
<p>The name of Wei Xue Lu has been famous for a long time. I have been in Shanghai for more than a year, and I have only heard of its name but never set foot in it. A few days ago, I visited a friend at Fenglin Bridge. My friend Lin Lihu invited me to Wei Xue Lu. As soon as I knocked on the door, the host greeted me and entered. We exchanged greetings and talked as if we had known each other all our lives. The furnishings in the room were elegant and antique, and the walls were full of books and paintings. Peng Guangcai's snow bamboo and Peng Xueqin's plum blossoms hanging on the walls can be called the best of both worlds. Sun Qinxi's and Wu Changshuo's calligraphy were especially famous for a time. There was a painting of sparrows by the famous Japanese painter Watanabe Chenmu, which Chenmu gave to the old man Hongwei during the Sino-Japanese Exhibition last year. The master Manqing's painting of pine trees and sleeping cranes is a large, magical painting with the grandeur of shaking his clothes on a thousand-ren peak and washing his feet in a ten-thousand-mile stream. A painting of lotus flowers has a free and easy style, and its artistic conception is beyond the mundane. After admiring it, I was in awe. Climbing the stairs and entering the Liuchun studio, the desks and inks were exquisite, and the fragrance of flowers was faint. The old man Hongwei showed me the Liuchun map. Reading the map, there were hundreds of flowers arranged, with five colors and ten lights. The famous flowers and beautiful plants were collected without missing a single one. The arrangement of each flower and leaf was not repeated. The posture of the horizontal and oblique sides was unique and clever. The color was charming and pleasing, and the brush strokes were swaying and wanting to dance. I think Nansha and Nantian cannot be unique in the past. My friend Lihu read it and sighed that it was amazing. Turning through the albums of poems and inscriptions, they were all from the famous people in the sea, such as Fan Fanshan, Yi Shifu, Sun Shi Zheng, Song Bolu, Wu Genzhai, Xia Tongfu, Ma Yichu, and dozens of others. The painters in the sea must have all browsed them. The inscriptions in the picture include Zhu Qiangcun's poem, "I have always drunk wine and read Lisao. Quanhui inexplicably turned into Ai Xiao. I laughed and put on the picture to recognize it again. Spring orchids and autumn chrysanthemums have always wanted to meet. Nantian is old and says that Qingyu kills powder to adjust lead and is enough to entertain himself. I think of He Jia's hermit days, when the cold pine and bamboo become a picture again."</p>
<p>Cai Jimin's poem, "It has been several autumns since I left Huaxian. A volume of vivid colors and fragrances remains. It is like Shaowen's tired feet and plucking strings to move the mountains. Yin Xing avoids his face to compete for beauty and asks which Wang and Lu came first. Saving knowledge of the hard work of the craftsmen, the general position is naturally natural. It is actually an excellent painting and calligraphy poem. The hands are sensitive and the heart is intelligent. It is appropriate that Huang Ting's first writing is not indulgent.</p>
<p>Ye Yufu's poem, "Slow spring, I cherish a piece of flying flowers fading away. In the green and gold pot, I vaguely return to life. Thousands of reds are noisy on the ground. The romantic past is traced back. Who knows the wonderful ink of Oubo. On the road to Yaotai, the flowers are in chaos. Autumn chrysanthemums and spring orchids remember each other. There is no color in the sky. The sea seal is born with light. Turning the fingers into reality, the clouds and mud and the dynasty and city are like guests. Let the light room lightly spread the Brahma's smile. How many times has the good often dwell in the permanent silence of the Fragrant Kingdom. I have sought in my dreams. But the fragrance of the candle is clear and the dust is accumulated in the silk curtain. The wind and dew are weeping and there is no strength left. I am left with a show of painting peaches and plums, playing with the sunny sunflowers and green weeds like brocade. I hate the shadow powder and tears." All of these are treasures that are not easy to obtain in recent times. Liuchun map is especially enriched by the beautiful creations of the hundreds of flowers. I have often heard that this picture was painted at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Every year on the day of the Flower Festival, which is the birthday of the hundreds of flowers, the old man Hongwei must display it for a day or cherish it with poems to wish the spring colors to remain forever. In addition, the new works are beautiful and cannot be remembered one by one. Only there is a booklet of poems written by Taihe Mountain on the table, which is said to be the second revised draft. The brushwork is like a wandering dragon and startling goose, ancient and beautiful, and an extremely rare treasure in the world. The host's home is near Yandang, so he drank me with Yanshan good tea, which was clear and refreshing like chewing flower fragrance. Reading paintings and tasting tea can be said to be pure. I sat among my friends and no longer knew the noise of the dust market, and all worries disappeared. Soon, the setting sun was setting, so I said goodbye and left. So I dipped my pen and wrote it down.</p>
<h3>Tinglin's Kidnapping of a Woman: He Tianjian</h3>
<p>Tinglin is in the countryside of Songjiang. The place is very remote, and the bandits are rampant. Kidnapping people and stealing goods from the neighbors happens from time to time. Last month, a young woman surnamed Mou took her two children, carrying wine and food to Tinglin to pay homage to the ancestral tombs. The wheat rice was freshly recommended, and the paper money had not yet turned to ashes. Suddenly, four or five bandits jumped out from the green maple forest. In a hurry, the young woman did not think of it as robbery. She did not care about what they were doing. The bandits laughed and said, "Whose beautiful bride is this? Her body belongs to our wealth." So they kidnapped the young woman and her children and left, leaving her servants and maids and sending them back. They were instructed to take a large sum of money for redemption. The servants and maids returned to their master and reported the bad news. He was very flustered and eager to find a way to rescue her, but he had no way to do it. Soon, he received a message from the bandits about a place for negotiation. After contacting them, the ransom demanded was too high, so he delayed. After a few days, the bandits suddenly sent a letter saying, "Such a beautiful woman cannot be without a huge sum of money. If you do not act early, I will marry her." The young woman is very beautiful and has the name of a beauty, so she is favored by her husband. The husband was extremely anxious after hearing this news, but he could not get a large sum of money for a while. If he was late, he was afraid that the beauty would return to Shachili. He was restless and couldn't stop talking. This matter was heard by my friend Qian Shouting, because Shouting's wife is from Songjiang. In recent years, the matter of kidnapping people and demanding ransom has become commonplace and not very rare. However, it is still unheard of to kidnap people's families and use marriage as a threat. The bandits' whimsy is also ridiculous.</p>
<h3>Doubts about Watching the Pygmy Show: Jun Shuo</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the month, there were people selling illusions and other tricks at the Nanmiao base. They used cloth to make a fence. The audience paid to enter the fence. A pygmy was painted on the cloth, very short and with a beard. A description was written next to it, saying that it came from the West and could sing, dance, and perform skills. I went to watch with a friend. I saw a person less than two feet tall with a beard. His face looked like he was in his forties. He could turn a top with his toes. I did not see him sing or dance. I said to my friend, "His shortness is not natural. I suspect that he was forced to be unable to grow taller. Pygmies are not like this." My friend said, "Have you ever seen a pygmy?" I said, "Although I have not seen it with my own eyes, I have read Zeng Jize's Diary of an Envoy to the West. I know that there are so-called pygmies." My friend asked, "What does the Diary of an Envoy to the West say?" I said, "You can go to my study and read it." When I arrived, I took out the book and checked it. His diary said, "On April 26th, I went with my wife, sister Zhong, and children to watch the pygmies. First, two men and women came out, each about two feet tall. Last, two people came out, each about a foot tall. The man was sixteen years old and the woman was eighteen years old. The man weighed nine and a half pounds, which is equivalent to seven catties and seven taels in Chinese weight. The woman weighed four pounds and nine taels, which is equivalent to three catties and ten taels in Chinese weight. Their voices were chirping like puppets in Beijing. Their shapes were also similar. Their bodies were small and their skeletons were weak like babies who were several months old. But their language was indistinguishable from adults. The novelties seen abroad are no more than this." So I said to my friend, "What I saw today is only short below the shoulders. Their heads are the same as ordinary people, so I suspect that they were made and forced to be like that. What the Diary of an Envoy to the West said is that the whole body is small, so it is said to be like a baby who is several months old." According to the diary, it was in the seventh year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. There are many people who have gone abroad recently. I don't know if they have seen it. My friend said, "If it is really made by oppression, is it humanitarian?" Therefore, I asked the readers to consider my doubts.</p>
<h3>A Warm Heart (1) (9) (2) Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Emerald Green Threads and Pearl Hairpins, a Beautiful Woman Returns; a Talented Scholar’s Humble Abode, Red Curtains, a Famous Courtesan Marries into a Prominent Family</p>
<p>Therefore, among the ten singing girls called in today, nine recognized Ling Zhixiang, young master Ling. It is said that several large companies and foreign firms in Shanghai all have an entertainment expense account. This entertainment expense is used for commercial socializing. Since they have this expense as a backing, then eating, drinking, and flower wine need not come out of their own pockets. They can open a public account, and their spending gradually becomes more lavish. You must know that they can earn tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands from a single successful deal. These entertainment expenses are only a few hundred or even a thousand or so, which is a worthy expense. Therefore, as socializing increases, or as days of revelry become a constant stream of hosts and guests, it gradually becomes more lively. Leaving aside everyone's views on calling for courtesans, let's talk about Mei Lanfang's Fen He Wan, which began performing at that time. After appearing on stage, everyone watched with full attention. Not only was his singing voice melodious, but his stage steps were also light and graceful. Other actors who play female roles are either too tall or too short. Some have no waist and are as bloated as winter melons. Mei Lanfang has none of these flaws and is just right. At this time, everyone at the tables unanimously commented on Mei Lanfang's appearance and skill. Some said his eyes were beautiful, saying that Mei Lanfang's eyes were somewhat nearsighted, but when his bright pupils turned, they looked even more beautiful. Therefore, many people determined that Mei Lanfang's eyes were nearsighted. In fact, his eyes were not nearsighted. That year, Zuo Shichen met Mei Lanfang in Beijing. According to Mei Lanfang himself, he had an eye disease when he was fourteen or fifteen years old. This eye disease lasted for a long time, about a year or more. By the time the eye disease healed, it was somewhat different from before. This was because at first, he was a little sensitive to light, and his eyes did not open wide when they saw light. Later, although the eye disease healed, his eyes were different from before. At this time, he was very worried that his eyes were ruined, which would be a lifelong illness, but he did not expect that people would find them beautiful. This was truly an unexpected thing. At that time, he also showed Zuo Shichen the photos he had taken before. He himself said, "When I was eleven or twelve years old, I was very ugly, really not presentable. Whoever saw me didn't say I was a little boy?" It turned out that he took photos several times every year and kept all the photos he took, whether in costume or in everyday clothes, as a negative. The photo albums were all clipped up, and there were several volumes, all brocade-embroidered and very gorgeous. He picked out one volume for Zuo Shichen to look at, saying, "These are all photos taken when I was a child. They are terribly ugly. It's really funny to look at them now." Zuo Shichen felt that he was really a bit foolish. His two ears were protruding and very large. His face was round and chubby. His head was shaved very high, and wearing that kind of robe and vest with all-around piping made him look particularly outdated.</p>

<h3>The Bank of China has cleared the Bund Underwriting</h3>
<p>Shanghai banks are divided into two factions: (A) Foreign merchant banks on the Bund</p>
<p>(B) Chinese banks have always been able to clear underwriting and collection for business procedures (referring to the mutual clearance between Chinese and foreign merchants). On the Chinese side, only China, Jiaotong, Tongshang, and Central, etc., and other Chinese banks who want to collect and clear are all transferred by the above-mentioned banks for agency collection and clearance. Recently, it was heard that the Bank of China, in view of the difficulty of transferring the collection and clearance of underwriting, has agreed with the banks on the Bund to join the group. All business underwriting and collection and clearance are commonly used, so yesterday the bank has notified the entire financial community of this procedure, stating that our bank will start from the 15th of this month to collect and pay banknotes in cash. The underwriting has been passed by the banks on the Bund, and all underwriting is commonly used, and all unilateral underwriting terms will be cancelled at the same time.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented New Peak in Gold Standard</h3>
<p>A closing price of 521.9 taels, an increase of 5.6 taels compared to yesterday. Speculators suffered a major blow.</p>
<p>Market sentiment was激昂 and unexpected. Yesterday's gold standard market was unstoppable and suddenly escaped the 522-tael mark, which is an unprecedented new high price. However, the waves were very turbulent. The previous market had a difference of more than 3 taels, and the subsequent market had a twist of 5 taels. The exchange rate was quite expensive, and the listing had already been reduced by half a gear. The bank's selling intention was tireless, and the demand in the industry was greater than the supply. Yuan Mao Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Yu Cheng Yong, etc. were all competing to buy, while the sellers were Heng Xing and Tai Xing. Although the large strip shrank in the morning, the price of silver increased, so the low price was opened. After the buyers became active, the exchange rate also increased, and the price gradually rose by 3 taels. In the subsequent market, Yuan Mao Yong, Da De Cheng, Zhi Feng Yong, etc. bravely pursued the rise, but Heng Xing, Sheng Da, and retail investors, etc. sold off, and the market price initially softened slightly. Then, the buying party surged forward, and the exchange rate was extremely tight, showing a peak of soaring momentum, and suddenly rose to a new peak of 521.9 taels. The market sentiment was激昂.

At this time, Zhi Feng Yong bought a lot, and the sellers seemed to be paying small amounts of money. At noon, the closing price was 18 taels.</p>
<p>The afternoon market soared and was unstoppable. The afternoon market opened at 518.3 taels. Wan Xing and others bought into it, and then Heng Xing and retail investors sold it.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Spot and Forward Markets Consistently Expensive</h3>
<p>British Exchange Rate: 1 Shilling and 10.25 Pence, US Exchange Rate: 45 Yuan, Japanese Exchange Rate: 1 tael and 0.0975 points</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British and Indian silver markets continued to shrink, but the US silver market rose instead. China and India had mutual supply and demand, and the market was balanced. Yokohama and Kobe City still had no prosperity or decline. The HSBC listed foreign exchange rate did not move from the morning until about 4 o'clock in the afternoon when it suddenly changed and shrank by half a gear, calculating British gold at 125 points as 1 shilling and 10.25 pence, the US dollar at 25 cents at 45 yuan, the Indian rupee reduced by 75 cents at 124 rupees and a half, the French franc reduced by 6 yuan at 1,148 yuan, the Japanese and foreign exchange reduced by 75 cents at 113 shields and 75 cents, the slope exchange rate increased by 5 cents at 124 taels and 75 cents, and the Japanese gold price increased by half a point at 1 tael and 0.0975 points.

Chinese speculators and Dalian traders all rushed in to hedge. A total of more than 100,000 pounds of British gold were settled.

Only more than 10 yuan of US dollars were sold. Shanghai Mitsui had some gains. As for Japanese gold, a total of about 1 million yuan was settled. Datong, Mitsui, and Sumitomo sold, and there were also a few throws that Sumitomo absorbed. However, the inflow and outflow of transactions was not lively, because the hedging was not appropriate and the gold price soared too much, but the market was extremely sharp and unparalleled.</p>
<p>The British gold had 25 twists and turns. The internal market had 25 twists and turns. The morning market in May was quoted at 1 shilling and 10.5625 pence, June 625, July 6875, August 75.

<h3>Public Debt Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market in the Shanghai Securities Market was quiet in spot trading, but the futures market suddenly turned strong. Large households on all sides had considerable inflow and outflow. The bond market environment was slightly better, and all bonds rose sharply. The initial buying sentiment in the morning was strong and continued to rise. The buying side dominated the two sessions before and after the afternoon market, and the bond price also rose gradually.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Remains Weak</h3>
<p>The trend of the yarn market is slightly weaker, because the overseas cotton yarn market is sluggish, the local people's hearts are weak, the current situation is unstable, the war is raging, and the mainland is also busy with silkworm farmers, so the actual sales are relatively sluggish, so the overall situation is flat. However, the buying party pulls tightly and does not let go easily, and it is difficult to fall sharply. At present, it is still in a hard state.</p>
<p>People's bids are slightly soft, and the atmosphere of the future yarn market is flat in the morning. Because US cotton has mixed ups and downs, the three-piece yarn has also declined, so after two or three rounds of bidding, it has softened, and each has fallen by one or two cents. In the afternoon, I heard that the spot yarn was not selling well, and the atmosphere was even more scattered. Each month continued to fall by two, three, or four cents. The statistics of the transaction volume for the whole day were 7,800 bales. The closing price of people's bids is listed on the left.</p>
<p>People's Bid Closing Price Up/Down Inventory Number August 153. Down 3 22300</p>

<p>June 152.4 31500 October 154.3 45900</p>
<p>July 152.5 427350</p>
<p>The actual sales are sluggish, and the sales of spot yarn are sluggish and have not seen any improvement. The statistics of the purchase volume by various gangs for the whole day are 615 bales. Among the peers, the purchase volume of 750 bales is the highest. The market is flat. Among the customer gangs, the purchasing power of the Guangdong gang is still the strongest, accounting for 310 bales. In addition, Sichuan entered 50 bales, Tianjin entered 30 bales, Xuzhou entered 20 bales, the mainland entered 45 bales, Ningbo entered 25 bales, Niuzhuang entered 10 bales, and miscellaneous gangs entered 35 bales.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Remains in a Chaotic Situation</h3>
<p>The cotton market is very 평담. The Han gang is pulling tightly and the situation is still strong, but the demand for spot cotton is 평담, and the attitude of manufacturers is 냉정. The Dong cotton foreign firm has received about tens of thousands of bales of fire machine cotton in the last month, and is preparing to transfer it to May. In this case, the market situation has become more and more weak in recent months, and the US cotton has mixed ups and downs, and the market is still 혼돈.</p>
<p>Future cotton continues to fall. At the opening of the Han bid in the morning, the atmosphere was weak because of the possibility of a large number of deliveries of foreign cotton. The price fell by one cent to five cents. In the afternoon, the near month rose by five cents, and the far month was 평담. A certain manufacturer was still selling new cotton in October. The statistics of the transaction volume for the whole day were 15,400 bales. The closing price of Han bid is listed on the left.</p>

<p>Spot cotton is still 청각. Because the Indian cotton has absorbed the local cotton, the manufacturers have no need to purchase it. The source is estimated to be 500 bales of Yao cotton, and there are very few sales on the market. The sales plate is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>US Cotton New Rise and Chen Fall</h3>
<p>The ups and downs were 20 to 30 pounds. Yesterday, the US cotton market was mixed. It fell first due to a large number of deliveries, and then strengthened due to excessive rainwater and short covering. The Chen cotton fell by 23 to 30 pounds, and the new cotton rose by 29 to 39 pounds. The spot goods fell by 25 pounds. British cotton futures rose by 12 points, and spot goods fell by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 10 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (12th telegram).</p>

<h3>Grain White Rice Sales Brisk and Firm</h3>
<p>Zhabei yesterday, there were very few ships from the mainland because the production price on the inside road was very different from the sales price in this port, and it had to be inverted by 78 corners. Therefore, the cargo passengers did not mainly sell urgently, but had to stay overnight. The low-grade Northern japonica rice had to be discounted and sold cheaply, so the market was stable and the low-grade was weak. Until yesterday, the market was lively because most of the medium and low-grade Northern japonica rice was returned to the inside road, and the supply to this port was scarce again. Although the bottom was as usual, the sellers could not help but wait and see due to cost considerations. At the same time, the stock of goods in various stores on this street gradually became thin, so they chose to sell at a high price, and the long-term weak and calm Northern japonica rice market situation immediately turned brisk, and the prices of high-priced ones remained stable, and the common medium-grade ones all tended to be firm, and the overnight fresh goods were also popular. The dry and sluggish dishware was slightly tight. The top goods opened between 19.89 yuan, and the arrival of Yangdu pointed goods was slightly connected, the buying was flat, and the market was stable. The general transformation of Yin was still not developing.</p>
<p>Ships from the south of Shanghai continued to be scarce, and the sales market on this street was still sluggish. Common Xibei japonica rice was rarely asked about, and the market was always around 19.78 yuan. At the moment, it seems to be hovering. The retail price of Su Tong machine japonica rice is not旺, and the rural sales are also sluggish. The overall plate has not risen or fallen. There is little arrival of early rice and early rice in the Southern gang, and the decline is not good. Only a small number of customer gangs want to enter high-priced goods, so they have seen an increase in the left corner. The trend here is better than the northern market. The arrival of Yangdu pointed goods is also dry, and the sales are not smooth. However, because of the rising price of foreign rice, it has turned from sluggish to firm. The sales of Baiyuan rice are both淡, and the price lacks prosperity and disgrace.</p>
<h3>Recent Powder Shape is Serious</h3>
<p>Rolling High by 1.75 Points... The Distant Future Looks High</p>
<p>Yesterday's powder market had a serious shape this month. Although the rolling short period has not yet arrived, the brewing of the market situation has become unavoidable. Because there are about 300,000 to 400,000 small and medium-sized factories among the short sellers, or they may actually be delivered out of the industry at the time of 巳. There are also about 400,000 outside short sellers. When the sales market has not yet risen, it can still pass peacefully. Now, the military and other northern sales are gradually moving. A certain large factory is unwilling to easily release the file, causing the short sellers to rush to cover their positions, and the long positions also increase their prices. At a time when people's</p>
<h3>Wheat Flour Mills’ Eagerness</h3>
<p>Continued Opening of Three Thousand Bags... Futures Have Already Turned Easier</p>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures were also seen easing, as current price fluctuations are mainly determined by the weather. Yesterday the weather cleared and the climate warmed, leading to market hesitancy. With the new wheat harvest season approaching, it is estimated that in the Suzhou area, new wheat will be available in about twenty more days. In Wuxi and Zhenjiang areas, it will be less than a month before a bountiful harvest can be expected. Considering the abundant rainfall during the spring season, there shouldn't be excessive rainfall during the harvest, so the new wheat harvest might be abundant. As a result, the June contracts were down 0.2 points from the previous day, July down 0.1 points, August down 0.2 points, and September down 0.1 points. The current wheat market situation is such that flour prices are gradually rising, and mills are still eager to buy, offering good prices. Bengbu wheat, Yaowan wheat, and Xuzhou wheat were offered at 5.1 taels per picul; Jiangxi wheat at 4.95 taels, 4.55 taels, and 4.15 taels; and lower grades at 3.95 taels. Shashi wheat was offered at 4.55 taels and 4.7 taels. A total of over three thousand bags were opened, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Overseas: New Silk Still Difficult to Unload</h3>
<p>Old Silk Inventory Remains Thick... Exchange Rate Shrinks, Price Weakens Further</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market remained sluggish. The inventory of old silk overseas remains thick, and with the exchange rate frequently shrinking, silk prices are weakening further. New silk is still difficult to unload. Only a few foreign firms in Shanghai made slight replenishments. It is estimated that the Qianli firm made 50 bales of Huangbai silk transactions, and prices are still expected to fall.</p>
<h3>Chang'an Cocoon Merchants Lower Prices to Compete for Purchases</h3>
<p>Farmers in the Chang'an area this year mostly raised foreign silkworm breeds. Although the rearing process was quite laborious due to uneven temperature fluctuations, the result was that only about 30-40% of the native silkworms were lost. The new cocoon harvest is generally 60-70% of a normal year, and the quality of the cocoons is also good. Various cocoon firms opened scales on the 10th. On the first day, the market arrivals were not abundant, and cocoon prices ranged from 45 to 50 yuan. On the second day, the price opened at 55 yuan. On the third day, a certain firm lowered prices to compete for purchases, offering a high price of 60 yuan. The industry was alarmed, as Shanghai foreign silk prices were surprisingly low. If cocoons were purchased at high prices, losses would be inevitable. A meeting was convened to control cocoon prices at 55 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou New Red Tea Has Already Been Released</h3>
<p>Price 34 Taels... Dozens of Cases of Luzhuang Zhenmei Are Already Available</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign tea market, the Ningbo and Shaoxing green teas produced by local tea factories were completely ignored by British and Indian firms. However, Wenzhou new red tea was opened yesterday by Jardine Matheson at 34 taels, which is 5-6 taels lower than last year. Dozens of cases of Wenzhou Luzhuang Zhenmei from the Gong Sheng Yong Sheng Chang Sheng tea warehouses have already arrived and samples should be available today. However, in recent days, the markets in Britain and France have not had large fixed quotas for new tea, and the market situation is unusually pessimistic, it is said.</p>
<h3>Qining New Red Tea Has Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Xin He Chang tea warehouse had already received seventy-two cases of Qimen red tea and fifty-six cases of Ningzhou red tea. However, the quantity is small and no samples have been distributed. It is said that large quantities of Qi tea will have to wait until around the 20th before they can arrive in Shanghai, it is said.</p>

<h3>Automotive News</h3>
<p>Special Commentary</p>
<h3>British New Road Safety Facilities Surpass Expectations</h3>
<p>Since the automobile was invented and put into practical use, the world has suddenly gained a new deadly weapon, creating a shocking sense of terror on the roads. The United States has the highest number of automobiles in the world. Therefore, the number of people killed and injured under the wheels each year is almost equal to the number of deaths from epidemics. Outside of the Americas, the United Kingdom ranks first in terms of road fatalities and injuries. At present, there are two major political issues in the UK: one is the unemployment problem, and the other is the terror on the roads. Both of these are important issues that the British government is deeply concerned about and is trying to remedy urgently. Since the number of automobiles and motorcycles became widespread in the UK, the sound of roaring vehicles has not stopped from morning till night on all roads. The difficulty of walking has increased day by day, and it is even more difficult to cross the road at any time. Those who drive bicycles back and forth are in even more danger. As a result, new annual records of deaths under the wheels are being established in the UK. According to a notice from the British Road Safety Association, in 1928, the total number of people killed and injured in automobile accidents in the UK was 170,976, nearly 500 people killed and injured every day. Among them, half were rescued, over 50,000 were disabled, and 6,138 died. London alone accounted for 1,237 of the total deaths, with an average of 4 deaths per day. The average death rate for the whole of England was 17 people per day. The statistics for 1929 have not yet been published, but according to a commentary in the London Daily, it has been proven that the statistics for 1929 will certainly exceed those for 1928 by a large margin.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the British Hospital Association on the cost of treating injuries caused by automobile accidents, the total expenditure for the whole year of 1927 was £230,000, while the medical expenses given to hospitals for injuries was only £26,000 for the whole year. Compared with income and expenditure, the annual loss was £204,000. This rather large loss has caused hospitals to pay attention to road safety. They have repeatedly suggested to the government that it should force the purchase of automobile accident insurance so that non-wealthy car owners, if they unfortunately cause an accident, will have the medical expenses for themselves and pedestrians covered by insurance companies. It is feared that if mandatory implementation is not carried out, the losses of various hospitals in the UK will inevitably increase year by year, and the terror of roads to pedestrians and hospitals will only grow. Recently, the British government has expressed acceptance of the proposals of the Hospital Association and will add a clause to the automobile driving regulations requiring the purchase of automobile accident injury insurance so that hospitals and innocent pedestrians will not be without adequate compensation.</p>
<p>Paris has begun to adopt a policy of "cars yielding to people" for road safety, completely reversing the idea of "people yielding to cars." Under each sign or light post that stops vehicles, there is an opening and closing mechanism. Pedestrians can freely open and close the mechanism at any time, causing passing vehicles to stop immediately and allow pedestrians to cross the road first. Even children can reach out and open and close the mechanism. Each post is guarded by a person who is only responsible for closing it. Since the implementation of this method, the number of automobile accidents and injuries in Paris has decreased. However, the UK knows that this method is feasible, but it may hinder the traffic of vehicles, so it is not willing to adopt it. The number of automobiles in the UK is about 1.7 million, and there are tens of millions of motorcycles and bicycles. The construction and repair of roads are provided by vehicles. Although there are many pedestrians, they do not contribute to road administration. If the Paris method is followed, many car owners will be dissatisfied. Moreover, this method is still not a good method. Therefore, the British government has now decided to move the vehicle stopping signs from the iron posts to the police officers responsible for traffic. On the one hand, this can ensure the safety of the police themselves, and on the other hand, it is easier to direct vehicles and pedestrians. At present, Norfolk has taken the lead in implementing this method. A leather belt is tied across the chest and back of the police, with a red light on the chest and back to facilitate the stopping of vehicles. Green lights are also tied on both arms to direct the movement of vehicles. With a turn of the body, vehicles can be directed. Turning the body every five minutes allows vehicles and pedestrians to have sufficient freedom of movement without any crisis. The power source is a small battery on the back, which is lightweight, compact, and convenient. It is expected that all traffic police in the UK will become vehicle driving signs this winter. However, no matter how perfect the vehicle driving signs on the road are, no matter how strict the automobile laws are, and no matter how earnestly pedestrians are advised, automobile accidents can only be reduced by a part, and in most cases, automobile accidents and injuries will still occur. If you want to completely avoid automobile accidents and injuries to pedestrians, you must fundamentally improve the roads themselves. The most important way to fundamentally improve the roads themselves is to improve the road construction. However, this is by no means a fundamental way to eliminate automobile accidents. The British government is now thinking about the roads themselves and is engaged in the construction of the most modern roads, just like houses with one or two floors. The bottom floor is for pedestrian walkways, the second floor is for heavy vehicles and motorcycles, and the third floor is for automobile lanes. In this way, no matter how many vehicles there are, pedestrians will be absolutely safe. This is the best way to fundamentally remedy the situation. However, this method is not easy to implement, so the British government plans to start construction in London. A layer will be added to the existing roads, with the lower layer being a pedestrian walkway and the upper layer being for automobiles and other roads. The United States' Chicago has already implemented this new type of road. London will definitely be able to start construction in the summer of this year.</p>

<h3>Hebei Province's Road Network's Enlightenment</h3>
<p>The Hebei Provincial authorities have recently paid more attention to road construction in order to develop transportation. The construction of roads throughout the province is divided into three categories: provincial roads, county roads, and village roads, according to the importance of the relationship between traffic volume and the simplicity or complexity of construction. Provincial roads start from the provincial capital and extend outwards to the provincial boundary or important towns, or connect with roads in neighboring provinces. Branch roads are built at important locations along the way to connect with them. County roads start from the county seat and extend outwards to the county boundary or important market villages, or agricultural, industrial, and commercial areas, and branch roads are also built to connect with them. Village roads start from villages and extend inwards and outwards to connect with each other. The above three types of roads are combined to form the province's road network. All roads in the province are important roads with heavy traffic, and their width is based on the width of two automobile wheel tracks. Each wheel track is eight feet wide, with an additional eight feet as a shoulder for pedestrians to use, so that there is no danger when two cars meet at the same time. County roads are the roads in a county with relatively simple traffic, and their width is based on one automobile wheel track. The width is eight feet, with an additional eight feet for pedestrians to use. Village roads are the roads between villages with even simpler traffic. The width is determined by the county government and local gentry or public organizations through negotiation, but it shall not be less than eight feet. However, the Hebei province has a vast land area and many roads. It is necessary to construct all of them to be able to speak of political training. However, after the wars, the people's strength is exhausted and the government does not have the financial resources to take the method of assigning responsibility. The provincial roads are constructed by the government, and the county and village roads are constructed by the county government and local gentry or public organizations through negotiation after the roads for agricultural affairs are separated. The responsibility is divided and the project is easy. The provincial road routes and the construction methods of county and village roads are described in four sections.</p>
<p>Provincial Road Main Lines (1) Beiping to Yu Pass: The road is constructed from Beiping outwards, passing through Tong County, He Yutian, Fengrun, Lulong, Funing, and reaching Yu Pass, and reaching Shanhaiguan. It is an important road from Beiping to Liaoning. There are many important towns along the line.

<p>County Roads: County roads are constructed with the county seat as the center, extending outwards to other county boundaries, or provincial roads, or important towns, seaports, rivers, or agricultural, industrial, and commercial areas, all directly intended to benefit the people of the entire county. The planning and progress of county roads are in four stages: (1) Specifying the trunk and branch lines of the road, providing detailed maps, and explaining the reasons for selecting each line, such as connecting a certain road to a road in a neighboring county, connecting a certain road to a provincial road, or passing a certain road through important Russian towns and agricultural, industrial, and commercial areas. (2) Calculating the mileage of each road and estimating the cost of construction. (3) Statistics on rivers and bridges passed through and their construction plans. (4) A detailed examination of the needs of each road and a determination of the phased construction method. As for the method of raising funds, it should be borne by the people's negotiations, or a portion of the local income should be allocated, or a surcharge should be levied on the regular grain, or public bonds should be raised. There are no more than these three methods.</p>
<p>Village Roads: Village roads, in addition to pedestrian traffic, are only used for agricultural transportation. The village road plan should be the responsibility of the village chief, who should organize a road construction group or committee with local impartial gentry to stipulate the route description of each road and the phased construction method. However, five points should be paid attention to when stipulating the village line: (1) There must be road connections between villages. (2) The village road route must be connected to a county road or a provincial road, or reach a seaport, river, or industrial, commercial, and academic area. (3) The starting point and length of each village road line should be noted. (4) Earthwork and labor for each road edge should be carefully estimated. (5) The location of bridges passed by each road edge should be noted, and the estimated cost of labor and materials should be estimated. There are also five aspects to the construction method: (1) The working section of the road should be allocated equally according to the population. For example, a certain road section is several feet long and the backfill is allocated to a certain household for contracting. (2) The road section contracted by each household should be marked with wooden pegs to avoid disputes. (3) Households that are unwilling to contribute labor to road construction should pay for the road section allocated to them and estimate the cost of construction. (4) The village chief should decide on the start and completion dates and submit them to the county magistrate for announcement. The fixed working period should be based on not harming agricultural work. (5) Those who deliberately cause trouble and delay work should be reported to the county magistrate for punishment, and those who work hard and complete the work ahead of schedule should be reported to the county magistrate for commendation to show encouragement.</p>

<p>Venus Also Has Animals Inhabiting It</p>
<p>Philadelphia - University of Pennsylvania astronomy professor and president of the American Astronomical Society, Dr. Oliver, advocates a new theory that Venus, like Mars, also has animals inhabiting it, and that the animals on Venus are more evolved. According to his argument, the temperature on Mars is about 60 degrees Celsius in the midsummer daytime, and often drops to below freezing at night. Therefore, it is undoubtedly certain that there are animals on Mars, but whether there are higher animals above reptiles, birds, and fish is still questionable. Venus receives more heat and light from the sun than Earth, so there should be very evolved animals inhabiting it. Although water vapor cannot be identified in the clouds of Venus with a spectroscope, the clouds of Venus seem to be higher than the clouds of Earth, and its oxygen and water vapor are at a lower altitude that cannot be observed with a spectroscope. Since Venus has water vapor and oxygen, there should be very evolved animals inhabiting it, he said.</p>
<h3>Aerial Survey of East Africa</h3>
<p>British Economic Development Plan</p>
<p>London - The development of East Africa has been a long-standing issue for Britain. Because most of the wilderness is inhabited by ferocious beasts and cannot be surveyed from the ground, the focus has been on aerial surveying. First, in January of this year, the British Aerial Survey Company was established in London to determine the fundamental policy for the economic development of Africa. At the beginning of March, aerial surveying, unprecedented in the world, was started. The technical director of the company, A. J. Greathead, had previously traveled from Cairo to Mombassa via North and South Rhodesia. According to his survey report, the most appropriate distance for aerial photography for a general survey of Rhodesia is about 2,000 feet from the ground. The terrain in front, behind, to the left, right, and below is photographed at an angle of 60 degrees, with five photos taken simultaneously every minute. Each copy retains one-third of the previous shot and two-thirds of the changed shots. The altitude, inclination, and photo number of the aircraft are automatically recorded at one end. The measurement cost is only 30 shillings per square mile. The survey aircraft is equipped with two engines to replace them in case of obstacles, ensuring absolute safety. From a height of 2,000 feet, one can see the migration and roaring of dense ferocious beasts in the mountains and fields, as well as the magnificence of the Zhang Pei Ji River Basin and Victoria Falls (400 feet), as if in the palm of one's hand, making people shudder. This survey observed that more than 700 million tons of copper are buried in North and South Rhodesia, and special lands buried with gold, platinum, asbestos, and diamonds are also identified by color, it is said.</p>
<h3>Chile Saltpeter Centennial Celebration</h3>
<p>London Convenes Meeting Focusing on the Eastern Market</p>
<p>This year marks the centenary of the activity of Chile saltpeter in the fertilizer industry. During this period, it has developed extraordinarily, expanding sales to the world, with an annual output of more than 3.2 million yuan. The London Saltpeter Association headquarters convened a meeting of branch representatives from around the world in London in June to commemorate the centennial of struggle, intending to seek future development and establish a sales system. The association's most watched and promising markets for the future are the countries of China and Japan in the East. It is believed that if the organization in this area is not prepared, development can be expected after it is established. Director Watase of the Oriental Headquarters was invited to attend the meeting to discuss development strategies, it is said.</p>
<h3>Russia Establishes Large Steel Plant</h3>
<p>Plans to Equip Eight Smelting Furnaces, Construction Cost of 70 Million Yuan</p>
<p>According to a statement issued by a certain trading company of the Russian trade agency in the United States, Russia is currently establishing the largest steel plant in Europe and one of the world's leading plants in the Ural region. The Asamaqi Trading Company of Cleveland will provide technical assistance. The plant is planned to be built on Mount Magnitnaya in the Urals, equipped with eight smelting furnaces with an annual output of 2.5 million tons of iron. In addition, there are flat furnace steelmaking plants, Bessemer steelmaking plants, and rolling plants. Nearby is a mine with an annual output of 5 million tons of pig iron, and the coal cinder furnace uses 4 million tons of coal per year, which is mined and transported from the Kezhine Basin in Siberia. The construction cost of this large steel plant is about 70 million yuan, including the construction cost of a street market to accommodate 10,000 workers and their families, as well as the construction cost of power plants and light railways.</p>
<h3>Primitive Savages in the Great Forests of Borneo</h3>
<p>Cai Xu</p>
<p>If we walk into the interior of Borneo, it is easy to find the state of life when humans were uncivilized, which can provide a definite textual reference when reading ancient history.</p>
<p>Among the ethnic groups scattered throughout Borneo, in addition to those living near the trading ports who are relatively open-minded, the rest are still ignorant and ignorant. The savages hidden in the mountain tails and forests have a kind of cruel and murderous wildness that is truly frightening to hear. They kill people as easily as they eat, and everyone carries a long knife with them at all times. They assassinate anyone they are dissatisfied with and display the skulls indoors. The more skulls there are, the more respected they are by the general public. This morbid psychology has become universal among them. Even the marriage conditions for men and women are based on the number of human heads hidden in the other party's (male's) house. On the women's side, they believe that the most desirable husband is the one whose family has the most human heads hidden, and she thinks that being able to marry a man as brave as a thief is the greatest honor. Although they possess cruel and wild traits, they also have a kind of admirable foolish loyalty. When trading with Chinese merchants, they only recognize one customer. No matter how others try to pull them away, they cannot pull away their mountain goods because the Chinese can provide them with the daily necessities they need, and they are particularly friendly to the Chinese. They rarely inflict their cruel and murderous wildness on the Chinese except when they vent it among various tribes of the same ethnic group. Therefore, there are footprints of Chinese in the deep mountains and great mountains. The places where savages gather - Jian Gang (transliteration) - is like the Chinese Limen. When you walk to the door, you must first knock on the suspended drum so that they can cover their lower bodies inside because they often live naked at home due to the hot weather. If you break in rashly, you will run into a nail. They do not have the strict protection of virgins like the Chinese norm, which can be said to be absolutely open. If you walk into Jian Gang and see a virgin, you may as well kiss her and even caress her breasts. Her parents are very happy to see it. They often recognize that you can look up to his daughter. However, if there are several virgins together, no matter how beautiful or ugly, you must treat them equally. Otherwise, the woman who is left out will feel ashamed of herself for not being appreciated by you and will always harbor resentment towards you. Also, no matter whether the food they give you is palatable or not, they must touch it with their fingers before they are happy. Otherwise, it will arouse their antipathy. They are as close to those they love as brothers and sisters, and as hostile to those who offend them as enemies. They will never allow those they hate to live in front of them unless they pull out their hanging knives and kill them. Therefore, it is necessary to ask about local customs when you first arrive in the unfamiliar Nanyang so that you will not suffer losses.</p>

People from all walks of life are happy to use it. Therefore, among the major stores in this city, those who come to purchase disinfectant invariably specify the Double Knife brand. Stores also exclusively favor the Double Knife brand for its popularity among the masses and therefore specialize in purchasing only that brand. Recently, due to very high demand, the stock in the market is quickly being sold out, leading some to personally go to the distributor, Sanyang Jingqiao Xinyuan Firm, to purchase with cash, hire their own vehicles, and transport the goods back at any time for sale. If not for the deep trust of the public, how could this be achieved?</p>

<h3>The Story of World Literature (1)(5)(2)</h3>
<p>Chapter 38: Nineteenth-Century French Poetry</p>
<p>Just as in the distant dense forest the water god</p>
<p>Sleeps beneath the tide</p>
<p>Hidden and concealed from the eyes of sacrilegious hands</p>
<p>The light of the spirit, Ah! Ah! Me!</p>
<p>Leconte de Lisle was a great classical scholar. Not only did he find inspiration among the ancients for many of his poems, but he also made unparalleled translations of Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Horace. All Parnassians were lovers of antiquity, and this was indeed the spirit of Romanticism. Although Leconte de Lisle felt that displaying one's wounds in the marketplace was unworthy of a true artist, he nonetheless embodied his own heartache in the suffering of all humanity, almost achieving the same thing. And even with his impersonal and inhuman attitude, he suffered deeply and spoke in a way that no sentimental Romanticist could surpass. (Based on Sally's translation.) John Macy, translated by Hu Zhongchi.</p>
<p>Ah! Ah! Brilliant tide of blood, come in your waves, listen to my confession, ah!</p>
<p>Only then can I, as a humble wretch, when reviling, maintain a pure spirit and migrate to my endless kingdom.</p>
<p>Gautier and Musset's young contemporary, who did not belong to that school but walked his own dark and mysterious path, was Charles Baudelaire. Some of the thoughts in his "Flowers of Evil" are evil, but evil is only one element in the soil, and the flowers are imperishable. Baudelaire saw a kindred spirit in Poe, saying that Poe's thoughts existed in his own heart but had never taken form. His admirable translation of Poe made that American writer a part of French literature. Translating Baudelaire into English would require a genius equal to Poe's, but the English poet Arthur Symons accomplished a beautiful translation of Baudelaire's "Prose Poems."</p>
<p>Like Leconte de Lisle, Baudelaire admired death and had an ideal of marble-like beauty.</p>
<p>I am beautiful like a dream of jewels</p>
<p>He was isolated and, though possessing some Parnassian ideals, did not belong to that school. Why? Because he openly and forcefully displayed his soul in the first person.</p>
<p>Théodore de Banville was a disciple of Gautier, and his skillful handling of rhythm matched his teacher. His thoughts were shallow, but he said what little he had to say perfectly. He skillfully revived the old French forms, the rondeau and the virelai (note), and produced them, together with Gautier, influencing English light verse poets.</p>
<p>(Note) Rondeau is a short poem with a recurring phrase, and virelai is a nineteen-line poem with two rhymes.</p>
