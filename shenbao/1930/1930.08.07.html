<p>— 新二</p>
<p>新近别樹發揚東方文化旗　的東方圖書出版社所發行的刋中華國畫雜誌創刋號巳經出版了我本來不懂藝術不過站在欣賞的立塲上披閱數過覺得興味濃厚材料豐富於是將其内容分别略叙如次</p>
<p>這期有文字十餘篇　（一）嚴獨鶴先生的「回畫的效用」共分三點第一是明顯第二是優美第三是富於剌激性以淺顯的筆調辨白出深厚的圖畫效用的道理來（二）周瘦鵑先生的「雪竇山之春」是這期裏篇幅最長而最有趣味的遊記繪影繪聲給讀者的腦海裏會泛起了許多層嵐翠障飛瀑流泉光風霽月隂雲驟雨種種的幻象和清幽的意味來（三）高梓女士的「全運女田徑之概評」一文將全運女田徑的過去利弊和將來的補救發揮無餘他如王大佛先生的「爲第九届遠東運動會進一辭」蔣介石將軍的「慈菴記」同周瘦鵑先生譯的可以爲一般青年座右銘的「真男子」和林南鵬先生補助民衆常識的「上海徐家匯天文台記略」以及吳雲夢先生「男子是　的」朱寛先生的零零碎碎」那幾段短篇文字大半加以照片令人讀之瞭然文字方面可謂藝術化了</p>
<p>所有圖片都充滿美的意味如胡伯翔先生的封面畫十一個美女穿着桃紅花的旗衫笑容可掬抱着個小狸奴彷彿嬌滴滴地真的說出一聲「我愛小狸奴」來胡伯洲先生的「大無畏精神」好像替革命的民衆寫照左手撑黨徽右手握鐵錐活躍出在青天白日之下應該以黨爲前提以武力爲後盾的神氣總計照片六七十幅除時事照片如「抗英之甘地」和彚集在一起的全國遠東兩運動會全國童子軍總檢閱全國步行團等等外美術攝影如郭錫麒先生的「慰勞」郎靜山先生的「斜陽」朱壽仁先生的「小憩」都是美術化的尤其以「蔣介石之故鄉」和「雪竇山之春」「上海天文台」「蜀中人民之建設」「海外新發明」等照片爲難能可貴</p>

<h3 id="c358">歐洲的節制生育與鼓勵生殖 <a href="#c358" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e358" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">358</a></h3>
<p>— 富蘭</p>
<p>近來歐洲各國的生殖率和大戰以前比較起來減退得着實可驚不過就大體講生殖的數字畢竟尚超過死亡所以各國的政府領袖們還不引起十分的焦慮内中意大利的生殖率獨獨見增進這是墨索里尼年來獎勵生殖和用别的勸誘方法來吸收更多的小國民的政策的成功</p>
<p>生殖率變動的原因就大多數的歐洲諸國而論不外遭遇下列的任何一種情形甚或兩者均備</p>
<p>（一）國内的經濟地位太形窮蹙不容國家拿出許多的金錢來鼓勵生殖</p>
<p>（二）國内人口稠密和失業問題巳經壓迫萬千的國民移居國外於是官廳不得不蹙額施行急迫的和繼續的增加人口的方法</p>
<p>中歐</p>
<p>中歐諸國大抵兼受上面二種情形的影響尤以匈牙利爲最因爲她在戰後大事土地清丈害了七十萬的農夫坐吃山空加以農業的不振結果又使失業的農夫增加了二十萬人</p>
<p>社會學者認爲有一綫希望的事情不是集中努力於嬰孩死亡率的减少成效很可逆覩據可靠的統計啓示則知目下英俄兩國正在努力於此項運動不列顛的嬰孩死亡率在一八九六年每千名中占一四八名在一九二九年巳减爲每千名中占七四名又如俄國在一九一三年每千名中占二六五名一九二八年也巳减至每千名中一五五名</p>
<p>德意志的生殖率在一九○一年每千中占三五八至去年每千中只占一七八减少至一半以上據柏林大學著名社會學者格羅全敎授Prof　Grotjahn宣稱他預備建議於一委員會調查實地情形着手於兒童敎育和兒童衛生的保險不過現下的德國經濟地位要她支出幾百萬馬克的巨欵來辦理這事委實是不可能</p>
<p>歐洲諸邦的對於節制生育觀念互有不同例如英國乃是最大强國之一自從一九一九年以來不論在那一所産科學校和福嬰的臨床宣講裏均禁止介紹一切節育的方法但在别一方面說我俄國墮胎是合法的關於一切的節育方法在彼邦正是介紹不遺餘力</p>
<p>關於各國的生殖率情形分别概述如下</p>
<p>德國</p>
<p>凡是未婚的男子要就他的收入内繳納百分之十的所得稅巳婚而没有子女的减爲百分之九巳婚而有一位子女的减繳百分之八在一九二九年中生殖的數字要比死亡多出三十五萬又在一九○七年平均每一對夫婦可有四位子女在一九二九年只有一九七了</p>
<p>目下德國人口是六千萬據專家推測若照現在情形下去到了一九七五年一定要减至四千六百萬</p>
<p>英國</p>
<p>目下英國從事於助産及福嬰事業的人共有四一三一人嬰孩的夭亡率爲了衛生的增進敎育的普及和種種的便利業巳大見减少政府雖然没有獎金但是做母親的産下一個嬰孩就可向國家康健保險局領取十塊錢本文裏的金額爲統一起見均指美金而言如果她的丈夫也保着險還可以再領取别的十塊錢設或一旦做父親的死亡做母親的每星期可得到她自巳的赡賽金二元五角此外第一個子女每星期一元二角其次的每位每星期七角五分直到他們分别長成至十四歲時爲止在一九一三年中英國的生殖數字爲八八一一三八人在去年只有六四四二一八人也和德國一般據官塲宣稱就目下的經濟地位立論所有工黨及職工同盟大會建議的由國家撥出三五○○○○○○○元巨欵來津貼家庭實在不易辦到</p>
<p>法國</p>
<p>在今年最初的三個月之中法國的生殖數字計超過死亡一○七九七醫院的進步皆足使嬰孩的夭亡爲之减少政府没有獎金給與做母親的但得享有减低旅費的優待如果做父親的有了十四或十五位的强壯子女往往得到很榮譽的褒章此外像康耀克獎金Cognac第一名達二萬五千法郎之巨至今依舊結予全國最大最有價值的家庭</p>
<p>意大利</p>
<p>貴族婦女流連於茶會宴席而草棚裏的婦女却大談其調護嬰孩的方法這事墨索里尼不能辭其咎他驚心怵目於生殖率的跌落認爲這乃國家衰敗的朕兆於是在三年之前急忙鼓勵生殖以期小意大利國民的增加他用種種的獎勵方法根據本年最初六個月的生殖率作標準那末一到一九三一年全國人口就可達四千三百萬換句話說一年中當可增加六十五萬比戰前每年平均五十萬的生殖率增加百分之三十在一九二七年墨索里尼第一次法令頒行的當兒他用於增進兒童幸福及助産事業的經費完全從稅取獨身男子而來此外更用盡各種方法來防止節制生育關於這一類的宣傳一概不准藥房裏没有醫生的命令不得配製節育藥方他更常常把地方上改進公共事業的欵項扣住吩咐官吏們說一等人口加增即當着手進行</p>
<p>俄羅斯</p>
<p>蘇俄是歐洲各國裏面死亡率最高之國在一九二八年中每千人中生者占四二而死者占一八一結果還自然的增加人口三百五十萬人國立學校裏均對工會會員施行節制生育的敎育不取費用婦女一經證明受孕得由一政府設立的委員會命令爲合法的墮胎但是爲了這個情形便有許多不合法的舉動隨之發生除了政府方面竭力提倡節育之外好像很拚命地鼓勵大家庭的成功勞工階級的母親産前産後各有二個月的完全假期不扣工資許多的大工廠裏都設置看護婦保姆預備做母親的在工作時候爲之照顧兒女按照目下的人口增加情形一到一九六○年俄羅斯就要有三萬萬人口了</p>
<p>匈牙利</p>
<p>雖則匈牙利現在巳有較大的人口超過於她所能維護但是幾多人還覺到生殖率的衰退亟亟獎勵生殖由政府替做母親的預備下很優美的醫院和療養院供給她免費的牛乳及醫藥上的帮助務使子女的産生不累及家庭爲如何的耗費</p>
<p>波蘭</p>
<p>此邦繼續不斷的人口增加委實是一副重擔在世界大戰前五年波蘭爲歐洲生殖率最高國家之一只有俄羅斯及中歐諸國堪與比肩目下生殖率每千中占三四結婚的人數年見减少</p>
<p>比利時</p>
<p>比利時的生殖率很快地降落而且跌勢還没有止住在一八八○年每萬中占三一一到了一九二七年跌落百分之四一目下成立一種機關凡是做父親的都可去借錢不要利息許多敎育機關都有政府補助使兒童們都有受敎育的機會政府工作人員之有家庭的减輕他的旅費或約略提高他的工資凡此種種的努力無非爲鼓勵小國民的增加</p>
<p>西班牙</p>
<p>此邦對於鼓勵生殖一舉很少動作前任狄克推多李佛萊氏曾經核准凡有兒女八人以上的無助家庭准予助給少數欵項但此僅係救濟貧苦爲限因爲是一個天主敎國家任何節制生育的方式與宣傳均在嚴禁之例她的生殖率在一八八七年每千中占三五七到了一九二八年每千中只占二九六</p>
<p>葡萄牙</p>
<p>嬰孩的死亡率很高對於實施節制生育的懲罰頗重她的生殖數目正和死亡及移民數目相等在一九一八年每千中占三四六到一九二八年爲三一</p>
<p>捷克斯拉夫</p>
<p>人口過剩節制生育是不知道的在一九二六年有三四四○○○名的生殖和二一九一四九名的死亡政府對於實施節育的有免費醫藥的帮助而對於實施節育的正在考慮罰律的擬定措置的矛盾如此</p>
<p>奥地利</p>
<p>此邦生殖超過死亡雖則並不鼓勵節育但政府也不予禁止節育器到處有出售單只維也納一地設有看護所二百處隨時遺派代表到各位繁殖的母親家裏觀察她們是否受有適當的醫藥調養此外還有一種社會保險金給予做母親的一等她的嬰孩出世就即發給並附贈一筐的嬰孩衣服如果做母親的日間要工作那末幼稚園裏對於小兒的照顧也規定得很周密兒童一達到六歲在夏季可以在半由政府補助的健康的田莊裏嬉戲避暑</p>
<p>斯干達尼維亞半島諸國</p>
<p>這半島上的諸國對於生殖率很少注意</p>
<p>瑞典在一九一三年中每千古占二三一至一九二八年跌爲一六丹麥從二五六跌至一九六芬蘭從二七一跌至二三二挪威從二四九跌至一七七</p>

<p>— 金鼎</p>
<p>草野社出版</p>
<p>我對於小刋物尤其是内容側重文藝的頗有愛好的旨趣草野周刋當然也是我所愛讀的一種因爲他的内容决無目前一般所流行於社會的「小報化」至少在文字方面是如此的以我客觀的目光來批評過去的草野因爲各個作者的思想不統一所以内容是没有一貫性的各個作者站於各個立塲上表現自巳我們讀了雖不覺怎樣單調但在思想上却給予我們紛亂的異樣的印象不能顯示出草野整個的中心這實是他過去的唯一缺陷在第一卷的草野裏可以說是他的萌芽期内容一般脫不了幼穉和淺薄的痕跡但這是一般雜誌初創時必然的現象在草野初期當然免不掉的丁第二卷的草野可以說是他的長成期内容漸漸地似壯年人地身體一般充量起來這顯然是該刋編者和社友的努力才有樣的成績還不能算爲成功不過在小刋物中可以說是獨竪一　了最近所出版的草野革新號（即三卷一號）實在巳由長成期進展到繁盛期了我讀了頓覺内容巳煥然一新以民族主義文藝爲該刋的中心思想在文字上無形中巳有統一性使我們腦底印着很深的映象和前二卷相比擬真是天壤之别了現在我抽些閑工夫將這期的草野介紹一下</p>
<p>「民族文藝的表現及想象」這篇論文的作者是湯增敭據我知道作者對於過去的草野巳盡了不少的力同時他在詩學方面實有相當的成功作者在本文的開塲先確定了文藝的中心思想將中國古代民族意識的文藝的長成作簡略的考察讀者能明瞭民間思想在民族進程中的歷史其次將民族文藝的「表現」方法及「想像」的要素有統系的叙述並且論及「想像」決不是「空想」Fancy關於這個也有具體的解說</p>
<p>「最後的一擊」這篇創作的作者是王鐵華讀過草野的人大都可以曉得他是該刋的編者創作小說實超於其他各種以上這算是草野讀者一般的觀察至少我自巳也是感覺到這樣的「最後的一擊」是分五段寫成以轟轟烈烈的中俄事件作該文的背景也可以說以歷史的事實作事實作者是用全副精力表現本文裏重要的主角趙連長的個性和愛國心的强烈促進他一個僅有十四齡的兒子也去爲國盡力在他自知病勢巳難治愈的時候還這樣熱烈地對兒子說「你英你要記我的話啊你十四歲的年紀也不小了我死了我不能安排你們的將來總之你要不忘我的死我國的創傷要憑你的力量去趕啊即使你將來做一個馬路小工也得輸送子彈到前方殺賊啊…」由此可見他愛國比諸愛子更形熱烈了在技巧上作者實獲得很大的成功在第一段裏趙連長對兒子發怒之際描寫着屋内一隻破檯子擺着兩個瓶子因牀的震動發出一種互擊的聲音最後一擊是寫俄兵騷擾該鎮的情形當俄兵雄赳赳的衝上小樓這破檯子只有小瓶在摇動最後作者才點出「樓下發現了一堆玻璃瓶的碎片」底暗示這顯然是說軍隊在騷擾進行之際趙連長是掙扎着將死的力量拿起小瓶向暴行的俄兵作「最後之一擊」以表露出愛國勇敢的心的熱忱這實是創作的技巧作者的表現又比其他一般寫「平凡故事」的創作的爲高超在小小的一張草野上能獲讀這樣强而有力以民族主義爲中心的小說殊屬欣喜在結構上該文似乎怱促一些這可見作者起初或許準備着寫長篇或中篇創作的現在旣然减縮成短篇也並無不可全文反而覺得緊湊但我希望作者能將該文根據着真確的事實演成一個有力的長篇使國人知道自謂扶助弱小者的蘇俄在中國是怎樣的暴行不法喚醒國人的民族意識</p>
<p>如文壇短訊等使我們能在這很短的消息中深印着中國整個的文壇消息和内幕以及各作家的行動及傾向用客觀的眼光作簡短的報告而且所刋的大都確實可靠這實在值得讚美的</p>
<p>總之這草野革新號在思想上各觀作者都巳獲得中心文字上亦漸漸地造成統一性使我們愛好該刋的讀者在無形中也得到正確的指示成爲青年們必讀的文藝刋物據記者報告該社今後方針值得我們愛護草野的人注意現錄兩節於下以作本文介紹的結束</p>
<p>在内容方面以後是力求充實無論是社友的與及外來的投稿都要加以嚴格的選擇如果没有值得一讀的佳稿我們是寗願在本刋上留着多量的空白同時决不合迎讀者的低級趣味在形式上從這期亦力改所謂「小報化」因爲我們的草野以後擬對於研求文藝的青年有相當的貢獻不爲是作「有閒」的朋友在茶餘酒後的一種消遣因此我們甘願草野的銷路仍保持着它的水平線甚至於减低</p>
<p>在文字上是極端地使它有一貫的統一性確定中心的思想這當然是民族主義的中心思想對於畸形的病態的文藝是不客氣的加以排斥倘若有以可站在同一戰線上共同努力民族文藝的我們是很希望他能和草野携手否則是企冀他還是各走各的路以後的草野是不容所謂投機的騎牆的思想紛歧的等等没有中心意識的份子</p>

<h3 id="e64">The Phenomenon of Declining Japanese Commerce <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>According to a survey by Japanese bankers, the price index in mid-July was 0.25% lower than the previous month and 1.995% lower than when the Hamaguchi Cabinet was established. Among the 56 items surveyed, 39 experienced price declines. The largest declines were in raw silk, followed by wheat. Other commodities, such as copper and cotton yarn, experienced declines internationally but not as significantly domestically. Rice and grains, on the other hand, became more expensive. Publicly purchased tobacco and alcohol taxes were also affected by the decline. The textile association in Katsuyama is facing delayed payments until the end of October due to poor business and financial difficulties, including wages. Other manufacturing industries are expected to follow suit. From this perspective, the decline in Japanese commerce appears to be worsening daily, and recovery in the near future may be difficult.</p>
<p>As for Britain, it is also making every effort to combat its own commercial downturn. An economic inspection group for the Far East has been appointed, and the Prince of Wales will personally visit Argentina next spring to hold a British industrial exhibition in an attempt to promote British goods in South America. Additionally, the major strikes in France are difficult to resolve, and Spain's increased tariffs on automobile parts are a retaliatory measure against the new taxes in the United States. A major international tariff war will arise from this. All of these phenomena are caused by the decline in commerce.</p>

<p>An official from the U.S. National Farm Bureau said that the problem of surplus grain seems to be solved naturally. Farmers in grain-producing states have used wheat to feed pigs and cut wheat as fodder because the grass in the fields has been scorched by the recent heatwave. Grain market brokers estimate the grain loss in July at 400 million bushels. The estimated drought loss is no less than 500 million yuan. The rural milk supply is feared to be interrupted due to the lack of fodder and insufficient milk.</p>

<p>President Hoover convened a cabinet meeting today to discuss ways to deal with the drought in the Midwestern regions. After the cabinet meeting, Hoover declared that the government is determined to make every effort to carry out remedial measures. All road bureaus have received government orders instructing them to investigate the disaster situation in various regions in detail and to submit a report on how the government can provide the most effective relief. At the same time, the Ministry of Agriculture is also rushing to investigate the disaster situation, and its report is expected to be completed by next Monday. According to existing reports, the drought has spread to the Mississippi River, Missouri River, and Wawaho River basins. The Thamer Valley is also within the disaster area, and its crops have mostly withered due to exposure to the scorching sun. If rain is not seen immediately, nothing will be recovered. Hoover is very worried about this matter and is determined to take relief measures immediately, planning to transport grain to the disaster area and transport livestock in the disaster area to places with grassland for grazing.

<p>Following the Spanish government's increase in import taxes on automobile parts, the Ford assembly plant here suddenly shut down today, with hundreds of workers losing their jobs. This move is clearly a retaliatory measure by Spain against the U.S. tax increase. The American retaliatory measure can be regarded as the first step in the international tariff war.</p>

At yesterday's meeting, Gupter and Bose were elected as candidates. Both are leaders of the National Party, but each supports one, and each has followers. Today, those who supported Gupter broke into the meeting place, shouting loudly, and some threw shoes at the Deputy Mayor of the Bose faction. The meeting was too disruptive and was eventually adjourned.</p>

<p>The Indian government's report on the Indian situation last week stated that order has been almost completely restored in various parts of the Northwest Border Province. The movement to destroy forest laws in the Central Province and Bombay Province is now gradually spreading. The economic situation in Bombay is deteriorating daily. The sales of cloth heads in Amritsar have plummeted. The average monthly sales value was previously 2.5 million Robies, but now it has fallen to 200,000 Robies. It is expected that the use of economic power will cause people to oppose the continuation of the non-violent resistance movement. The progress seen in the previous week has been maintained unchanged.</p>

<p>Japanese Naval Treaty Review: The Privy Council Demands a Response</p>

<p>Prime Minister Hamaguchi convened an emergency meeting yesterday with Minister of Finance Eda, Minister of the Navy Abe, and other ministers, as well as the Chief of the Legislative Bureau of the Privy Council, to discuss the report that Privy Council President Kuratomi visited the Prime Minister on the evening of the 4th, requesting the government to submit the responses from the military councilors' meetings necessary for the Privy Council to review the naval treaty, as well as various reference materials. As a result of deliberations on how to respond to this, the government's attitude was decided as follows: (1) The responses from the councilors' meetings are confidential military matters and, according to regulations, absolutely cannot be submitted to the Privy Council. This request from the Privy Council is an act of infringing upon the supreme command. Only the Prime Minister, upon imperial command, has read and is aware of the contents of the responses. The Privy Council authorities do not even have a copy of it. However, if the Privy Council wants to know what the content is, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of the Navy, in their capacities as naval leaders, can consult with Director Taguchi and unofficially and indirectly inform them. (2) The supplementary plan for the London Treaty cannot be fully expressed in concrete terms, so the general outline of its principles will be explained and understanding will be requested. (3) Other reference materials will be submitted as soon as possible so that the Privy Council can convene the review committee and begin its deliberations.</p>

<p>Admiral Anbo arrived at Tokyo Station at 8 pm last night and immediately returned to his residence. He said to the Communications Agency reporter who visited him, "My return home is because the task of accompanying Their Imperial Highnesses Prince and Princess Takamatsu to England has been completed, and there are no special matters. I cannot comment on matters such as the appointment of the Minister of the Navy and the resignation of councilors. I also admit that the military strength is insufficient, but I believe there are other ways to supplement it. In short, as one of the people related to the treaty, I feel a great sense of responsibility. I can state this clearly."</p>

Among the 56 items surveyed, 39 experienced price declines. The largest declines were in raw silk, followed by wheat. Copper and cotton yarn are international commodities. Domestic products did not decline much, and the most expensive item was rice, with most of them being grains. This point is most noteworthy.</p>

<p>To All Newspapers: I have recently received a report from Division Commander Luo Lin stating that Tongcheng County Magistrate Hu Guanglu reported that the county was engaged in fierce fighting with the vanguard of the Red Bandit's Eighth Army. They captured Yang Guohua, a commander of the bandit troops. According to his interrogation, the capture of Changsha was carried out by the Eighth Army's vanguard, led by Army Commander Li Can, with Li Zongren and Zhang Fakui acting as forward commanders. The plan had been discussed and agreed upon with Li Zongren and Zhang Fakui, and they had allied with Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan in the north through the introduction of Wang Jingwei. Yan Xishan has now dispatched Zhao Hengti as his plenipotentiary representative, and Tang Xiangming has dispatched Liu Chenglie as his plenipotentiary representative to Hankou to coordinate with our commander-in-chief. After capturing Changsha, they will join forces with Red Army troops from various locations to seize Wuhan, indiscriminately burning, killing, and looting, targeting especially the imperialist foreigners. Our leaders are numerous and frequently provide supplies to the Red Army's uprisings in various counties from the Japanese and French concessions in Hankou. Respectfully reported, He Yingqin, humbly.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e131">Detailed Account of the Communist Bandit Capture of Changsha <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Entire City Reduced to Scorched Earth</p>
<p>Over 500 Officials Massacred</p>
<p>The Communist bandits captured Changsha on August 27th, burning and looting, causing unbearable grief and cries of agony from the city's residents. The reason the Communist bandits were able to capture Changsha was that the Hunan authorities had not taken precautions. When the Communist bandits invaded Pingxiang and Liuyang, many representatives from those counties pleaded that the bandits' power was immense and should not be ignored. However, He Jian always replied that they were just insignificant clowns who could be wiped out as soon as the troops arrived. It was only when the Communist bandits had captured Pingxiang and Liuyang for several weeks and advanced to Jinjing, 90 miles from Changsha, that the newly appointed commander of the 15th Division, Wei Suzhong, personally led the Hou, Deng, and Wang regiments to suppress them, deploying defenses on Fengxing Mountain on the west bank of the Chishi River. The Communist bandits resisted on the east bank of the Chishi River. On the 26th, the Communist bandit riot troops charged forward under the machine gun fire of the provincial military organs, disregarding life and death, and encircled the entire Deng regiment. The regimental commander was killed in action. The bandits then seized the opportunity to advance rapidly, and many members of the Hou regiment were disarmed. The Hou regimental commander and Wei Suzhong were also injured in the legs by spears and fled to the provincial capital to report the emergency, with most retreating to the area around Hujiadu (five miles from the city). They secretly set up electric fences around an area of about 20 miles and urgently transferred the Li Jue and Chen Wo brigades to the province to assist in the defense. However, the Communist bandits learned that the provincial capital's military strength was limited and took advantage of the weakness to launch a fierce attack. Except for a portion that could not advance due to the electric fences at Hujiadu, the rest were divided into two routes: one bypassing Hujiadu via Chennandu and the other attacking Xinhua through Laodaohe. At the same time, about 400 to 500 Communist Party members who had been lying dormant in the city gathered at Xiaowumen and Zixinsuo to stage a riot, responding from both inside and outside the city. Even though He Jian personally commanded the front-line troops, he was unable to stabilize the situation, and they retreated across the river to Ningxiang and Yiyang. The Communist bandits entered the city on the evening of the 27th, first setting fire to the provincial government, followed by the police headquarters, public security bureau, court, and other organs. Churches, foreign firms, warehouses, and the Japanese consulate were also destroyed. Schools and public buildings were either burned or demolished in large numbers, and the prosperous shops in the Bajiaoting area were also completely destroyed. However, because He Jian had repeatedly declared that he was confident in suppressing the Communist bandits and even declared at 4 p.m. on the 27th, when he was about to go on an expedition, that he would swear to defeat the bandits and would perish with the city if there was any danger, most of the heads of the organizations and merchants in the city did not flee. According to investigations, those captured and killed by the Communist bandits included Hu Yuantan, the president of Hunan University, Cao Bowen, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Wang Hanchuan, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wang Zhengshi, the magistrate of Changsha County, Luo Xiankai, the director of the National Defense Bureau, Chen Wenwei, the former director of the Hunan Industrial Bank, and about 500 other service personnel from various organizations. After entering the city, in addition to arson, murder, and rape, the Communist bandits posted slogans and encouraged peasant and worker riots to kill all Kuomintang members, bourgeoisie, and administrative officials. Li Longbang (i.e., Li Lisan) issued a proclamation in the name of the pseudo-Chairman of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, claiming that they would join forces to invade Wuhan, disrupt the country, and implement red rule. In this situation, people from all walks of life successively disguised themselves and fled to Hankou alone, about 3,000 people gathering at the Changjun Guild Hall to discuss the matter. They unanimously agreed that the Communist bandits were arrogant and that it would be difficult to eliminate them without a large army. After unanimous discussion, it was decided to organize a petition delegation to petition the Wuhan Headquarters and send three people to the capital to report the situation, requesting that two divisions or more of troops be stationed in Changsha permanently. A telegram was also sent to Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, requesting that he quickly dispatch crack troops to Hunan for rescue. The telegram is as follows: "Commander-in-Chief Chiang, respectfully: The Communist bandits have captured Changsha for more than eight days. Investigations reveal that they have more than 10,000 firearms, and numerous machine guns and artillery. The bandits have a strength of over 50,000. Recently, they captured approximately 600,000 rounds of ammunition that the Fourth Route Army was transporting but lost in the province, and seized nearly 5,000 firearms. They have already become a raging fire. The Communist bandits claim that they will capture Nanchang on the first day of this month, join forces in Wuhan, seize the political power of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, and establish a Soviet government. Now the people of Changsha are suffering from the tragedy of burning and massacre. Gentlemen such as Hu Yuantan, Luo YunKai, and Chen Wenwei have all been killed. In short, corpses of citizens killed under knives and guns are scattered throughout the city, and the Xiang River is stained with blood. All official offices, schools, public organs, and foreign consulates, merchant warehouses, and barges have been burned to ashes, forming a scene of scorched earth. The burning and killing are still continuing. This is truly an unprecedented catastrophe in 5,000 years. In recent days, nearly several thousand refugees have fled to Hankou, and the vast majority of the remaining people are trapped under the blazing flames with no way to survive, left to be slaughtered. If this disaster is not quickly eliminated, it will not be limited to Changsha. Therefore, today's matter is definitely not a local problem in Hunan, but a matter of the survival of the Party and the country. The representatives have fled to Hankou one after another, gathered to discuss, and reported to the Headquarters on the one hand, and sent representatives to the capital to report the tragic situation on the other hand. A special telegram urgently implores your Excellency to fly two divisions of crack troops to Hunan day and night to join the Fourth Route Army in encircling and suppressing them, otherwise, the fierce flames will surely be uncontrollable. Weeping and presenting this report, awaiting instructions. Hunan Refugee Petition Delegation Representatives Zuo Xueqian, etc., kowtow, seal." (Note: This letter was sent by a correspondent stationed in Hunan after fleeing to Hankou.)</p>
<h3 id="e132">Special Martial Law in Ganzhou <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Military and Police Deployment Unusually Tight</p>
<p>Anti-Communist Atmosphere Extremely Tense</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch, July 31st: In this province, where Communist Party members He Long and Ye Ting launched a riot in Nanchang, commemorative activities are held every year on this day to oppose communism. However, this year is quite different. Since the Communist bandits withdrew from Zhangshu and captured Gaoan, the atmosphere in the provincial capital has been extremely tense. The Provincial Government Chairman and Commander-in-Chief of the Ninth Route Army, Lu Diping, specially appointed Zhang Huibi, the commander-in-chief of the suppression of bandits in the province, as the martial law commander of Nanchang City on the 25th of last month, announcing temporary martial law to take precautions. For the Gaoan bandits, the 52nd Brigade of the 18th Division and the first security team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau were sent to suppress them. These units were initially deployed in the area around Wanshou Palace and Shengmi Town, 60 miles from Nanchang. Later, to change the strategy and shorten the defense line, they moved from Shengmi to the key points of Niuhang Railway Station, Qingyunpu Bus Station, Dingjiashan, and around the city, building unusually tight trenches and electric fences. Since the announcement of temporary martial law in this city on the 25th of last month, sentries and military police have been patrolling the surrounding works day and night. After 10 p.m. until 5 a.m., traffic is cut off, and no one is allowed to pass without a pass from the martial law headquarters. The situation last night was even more serious. From 7 p.m., pedestrians on the streets were checked, and at around 9 p.m., all shops closed their doors and windows, and it was very quiet. At around 10 p.m., traffic was cut off, and only the sound of military vehicles rushing back and forth could be heard. (August 1st)</p>

<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Military authorities such as Yang Shuzhuang, Liu Heding, and Fang Shengtao have been planning to attack Lu for days. The original plan was for both the provincial capital and the downstream areas to launch a general offensive simultaneously within a week. Unexpectedly, Fuzhou was suddenly hit by a South Pacific hurricane on July 28th and 29th, with extremely strong force. Power lines were broken in the city, and crops and trees were destroyed in the suburbs. On the 30th and 31st, heavy rain continued to pour down, darkening the sky and the earth. Mountain floods broke out outside the various passes, flooding fields and roads, greatly hindering transportation. Society generally believed that the war might be postponed due to the weather. However, Zhou Zhiqun's brigade took advantage of this opportunity to invade Liu's division's position at Xiaobeiling, more than 30 miles outside the north city, on the evening of the 31st. The Chen Wantai brigade of Liu's division, which was stationed there, immediately responded. After receiving a telephone report, the division headquarters transported troops to the front line in public buses overnight. However, because the front line was very far from the city, and the wind and rain were severe, the situation at the front was still unclear. Newspapers here did not publish any reports. It is only heard that both sides are focusing on assault in this battle. Liu's division has selected soldiers skilled in combat and formed a big sword team of 2,000 people to participate in the front lines. Lu's troops are also collecting knives and guns to prepare for distribution to the soldiers. It is thought that the situation of hand-to-hand combat in the future will be more intense than in the previous two phases. In addition, the various troops in Fuzhou awaiting dispatch to attack Lu are currently printing three types of leaflets: one informing the people of northern Fujian that whoever kills Lu Xingbang will be rewarded with 20,000 yuan, whoever kills Lu Xingrong and Yang Yugu will be rewarded with 10,000 yuan, and whoever kills Yu Boliang and Chen Zhongcong will be rewarded with 3,000 yuan; one informing Lu Xingbang and Xingrong to repent of their past mistakes and quickly hand over their troops and leave Fujian, and the various troops will guarantee their personal safety; one informing Zhou Zhiqun that the current troops attacking Lu have nothing to do with Zhou and should not be obsessed with failure, or should listen to Chen Jitang's advice to send his troops to Guangdong for revolutionary labor, or send representatives to the province to discuss solutions, all of which are possible. However, Lu's troops have now abandoned the name of the newly編 Second Division and changed it to the 19th Army, with Lu Xingbang serving as the army commander and Lu Xingrong, Zhou Zhiqun, Wei Chu, and Lu Xinming each serving as division commanders. Leaflets were also printed and mailed to various organs and groups the day before yesterday, with extremely absurd language. (1st)</p>

The method of rectification, in addition to increasing revenue, is to temporarily reduce redundant organs and existing expenses. Now a table has been drawn up listing the expenses that should be reduced, the expenses that should be suspended, and the agencies that should be abolished, and it will be implemented from August. All arrears and back wages of the abolished agencies and laid-off personnel will be repaid in installments by the Finance Department. The number of expenses reduced and suspended for each agency and those that will be abolished first are recorded below: (1) The provincial government's monthly allocation is reduced by 17,362.10 yuan; the Department of Civil Affairs' allocation is reduced by 6,813 yuan; the Poor People's Education and Welfare Institute's allocation is reduced by 1,000 yuan; the Huier Orphanage's allocation is reduced by 700 yuan; the Orphanage's allocation is reduced by 700 yuan; the Relief Office's allocation is reduced by 300 yuan; the Finance Department's allocation is reduced by 11,532.50 yuan, plus 1,000 yuan for financial fees and land fees; the Department of Education's allocation is reduced by 6,600 yuan; the Department of Construction's allocation is reduced by 6,369.90 yuan; the Highway Bureau's allocation is reduced by 1,760 yuan; the Promotion of National Products Association's allocation is reduced by 200 yuan; the High Court's allocation is reduced by 11,374.30 yuan; the arsenal's allocation for custody fees is reduced by 150 yuan; the armory and the North Warehouse's combined allocation for custody fees is reduced by 150 yuan; the provincial capital's municipal construction fee is reduced by 5,000 yuan; the New Era Middle School's allocation is reduced by 800 yuan; the Fujian Consumer Cooperative's allocation is reduced by 200 yuan; and the wireless telegraph bureau's allocation is reduced by 1,000 yuan. The expenses of the above-listed agencies are approximately reduced by half compared to before.</p>
<p>(2) The expenses that should be suspended are the propaganda expenses of the Minhou County Party Department, the subsidy for the Women's Embroidery Factory, the subsidy for the Women's Factory, the subsidy for the People's Women's Handicraft Training Institute, the subsidy for the Women's Handicraft Training Institute, the subsidy for the Maternal and Child Care Bureau, the subsidy for the People's Free Clinic, the subsidy for the Civic Benefit Society, the subsidy for the West Lake Autonomous Village, the subsidy for the Agricultural Experiment Field, the subsidy for the West Lake Park, half of the expenses for the four forest areas, the overseas Chinese affairs expenses, the salary of Luo Zhongcheng, the provincial government's foreign affairs consultant, and the allowance for army officers.</p>
<p>(3) The agencies that will be abolished are the provincial district relief院, the National Products Exhibition Hall, the Budget Committee, the Chinese martial arts hydro-electric preparatory office and the工艺传习所 As for the redundant organs such as highways and water conservancy that were planned to be abolished a few days ago, most of them were under the jurisdiction of the Department of Construction. Afterwards, Jiang Pingfan, the director of the Department of Construction, went to the provincial government and strongly argued that the matter was related to construction and could not be completely abolished, and that the agencies such as the Measurement Bureau and the Highway Bureau were directly under the jurisdiction of the central government and could not be easily suspended. Chen Peikun, the provincial committee member, also advocated prudent handling, so it has not yet been put into effect. (August 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e135">Communist Bandits of East River Retreat to Western Fujian <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Special Service Battalion Recaptures Raoping</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Recently, Guangdong Province has been busy using troops in Hunan and Guangxi provinces, and the defense troops have been mobilized frequently. The defenses of the various departments are inevitably taking care of one and losing the other, and the bandits are taking advantage of this opportunity to steal and commit crimes. The East River is particularly serious, as the counties of the East River have always been areas where Communist Party peasant troops have been出没. Since the 61st Division of Jiang Guangnai entered Hunan to fight, and then moved north, the East River defense area left behind was taken over by the 62nd Division of Xiang Hanping. The Raoping Communist bandits suddenly captured the county seat when it was empty last month. The rich people fled and the agencies were robbed. After receiving the report, the commander of the 62nd Division, Xiang Hanping, immediately sent a special service battalion to cooperate with the county's backbone team to suppress them on different routes on the 26th. After several contacts, more than 30 bandits were killed before the county seat was recaptured. Now the Communist bandits have溃退 to Damutian and Maozhiqian. The next step is to prepare for the aftermath and send a team to follow up and pursue them, in order to wipe them out in one fell swoop and avoid future troubles. According to the county magistrate and battalion commander, a victory report was sent from the front line, detailing the retreat of the bandits as follows: "On the morning of the 26th, I cooperated with Captain Chen Kewu to lead the team to attack the Communist bandits in Raocheng and advanced towards the bandit nests in Youfenggang, Sipai, and Shijing. The fourth company was assigned as the vanguard and the third company as the response, dividing into the left and right wings for strict searching. At 9:00 a.m., we arrived at Bakelou. The 200 Communist bandits occupied the dangerous terrain and bombarded us. After an hour of stalemate, our fourth company bravely charged and resolved them. The bandits collapsed along the Xiyan Mountain towards Damutian. More than ten bandits were killed on the spot, four were captured alive, and eight red flags were seized. At 10:30 a.m., we continued to advance towards Shijing to suppress them. The hundred or so bandits still stubbornly resisted, occupying the dangerous terrain. The left wing was resolved after fierce fighting until 12:00 p.m. I personally led the third company to participate in the right wing's fierce attack. The bandit's morale was unsustainable, and they fled towards the Ling Retreat between Dama Mountain and Liufeng. More than 20 bandits were killed in this battle, three were captured alive, many red flags were seized, and a captured police team member was released from the city before it fell. My battalion camped in Chen Di that night, and will advance to Maozhiqian Bandit Nest through Qixia at dawn tomorrow. Respectfully telegraphed for your inspection. Huang Binglin, Battalion Commander of the Special Service Battalion, bows with gratitude." Also, County Magistrate Chen telegraphed, "The backbone team of my county set out with the battalion early on the 26th to suppress the bandits. According to the report on the evening of that day: (1) At 8:00 a.m. this morning, we encountered thousands of Communist bandits at Shuikou who burned the Xicailou and resisted our army. Our army opened fire and shot for more than an hour, and the bandits collapsed towards Hengling and Liupubei. (2) Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue them to the vicinity of Shijing. The fourth company of our special service battalion launched a fierce attack, killing dozens of bandits, capturing seven alive, seizing nine red flags, and releasing a captured police guard team member. (3) It is reported that the Communist bandits who fled to Maozhiqian have fled to the border with western Fujian. Tomorrow, our army will advance to Maozhiqian to suppress them. The details are telegraphed for your inspection. Chen Dongqing, Magistrate of Raoping County, kowtows." (August 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e136">Guangdong Province's Method of Raising Funds for Exchange of Paper Money <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Implementing a 2% Surcharge on Treasury Revenue to Absorb Unredeemed Currency</p>
<p>Opening Deposits for Unredeemed Paper Money Starting This Month</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since the military兴, Guangdong Province has been busy with the繁供億, and the unredeemed paper money from the Central Bank, such as 5-yuan, 10-yuan, and 50-yuan notes, has not yet been restored for exchange. This has been the case for a long time. Fan Qiwu, the Director of the Department of Finance, believed that the military has now rested slightly, so he personally went to the capital to discuss Guangdong's finances and the Central Bank's redemption with Minister Song Ziwen. It is estimated that there are about 15 million yuan of unredeemed paper money from the Central Bank circulating among the people in Guangdong. If it is possible to find a way to absorb more than half of this amount, it will be easier to handle the re-exchange in the future. Recently, the authorities plan to levy a 2% surcharge on all national and provincial treasury revenue starting in August. This 2% surcharge will be allocated to return financial certificates, and this 20% surcharge will be allowed to be paid with 10% unredeemed paper money. Assuming that Guangdong's national and provincial treasury revenue is more than 5 million yuan per month, a 2% surcharge will yield 8 million yuan. If half of it is used to collect unredeemed paper money, the government's monthly revenue of unredeemed paper money will be 4 million yuan. Two months of revenue of 8 million yuan will have absorbed half of the total amount of unredeemed paper money circulating in the market (since the total amount is about 15 million). In addition, if the people are encouraged to deposit unredeemed paper money in the Central Bank in return for interest, the people will be happy to do so, and this can also recover a lot of unredeemed paper money. In this way, the unredeemed currency in存 the market will be in oversupply. When the authorities announce redemption two months later, it will not be difficult for the above-mentioned unredeemed notes to immediately restore their legal price. The method of encouraging people to deposit unredeemed paper money was implemented yesterday (August 1st) after being announced. The method of depositing currency is divided into two types: current and fixed deposits. Current deposits can be withdrawn at any time, while fixed deposits are for a period of three months and are handled by the business department of the Central Bank. The branches and sub-branches will not open to receive deposits for the time being. The procedures are in accordance with the Central Bank's deposit methods. The only difference is that unredeemed paper money is deposited in exchange for cash interest, as the interest will be paid in silver coins in the future. The current interest rate is 1%, and the three-month fixed interest rate is 4.5% per week. Attached is the Central Bank's announcement: "This bank has now received instructions from the Guangdong Provincial Government Cai Zi No. 255 approving the opening of unredeemed paper money deposits from August 1st to the end of October, including current and fixed deposits. Current deposits will be calculated daily, with an interest rate of one mill per thousand yuan of paper money, and the three-month fixed interest rate will be 4.5% per week. Interest will be paid in silver coins, etc. I hereby comply with the order to open for receipt from August 1st and inform all." (August 1st evening)</p>
<h3 id="e137">Zhejiang Province Increases Levy on Land Consolidation Fees <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Last year, Zhejiang Province established a land bureau to handle surveying and mapping work, but due to financial difficulties, it was unable to fully develop. Now, the director of the Land Bureau, Yu Junmin, has drafted three measures to determine the land consolidation business fee in order to raise funds for conducting clearing and measurement, and submitted them to the provincial government for review. The measures have been approved by the provincial government meeting. In addition to revising the survey and mapping fee rates and collecting the land price for overflow land and lost grain land, which will be implemented gradually during the measurement process, the first measure is that each county in the province should levy a land consolidation business opening fee of silver triangles per stone/tael under the item of land tax compensation money. The counties shall affix a stamp to the money as they are collected with the grain, and hand it over to the Finance Department, which shall allocate all of it at any time. The 19th year's share shall be used for one year, and the Finance Department shall send a telegram to the counties, requiring them to affix the stamp and collect the money from the date of the telegram, and to remit it to the treasury in cash as a special payment in accordance with the Construction Special Donation Method. The payment shall be cleared monthly and the money shall be remitted monthly within the first ten days of each month, and shall not be mixed with other payments or allowed to be抵解 with劃款. In addition, the busy season grain tax for the 19th year has already been levied in various counties. If some counties have already completed the busy season and the money that should be levied should be levied in the next busy season, and if both the busy seasons have been completed, it shall be levied in the next year to ensure fairness.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Xiaosuo Bandit Atmosphere Has Been Pacified <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: The bandit gangs in the Xiaosuo area south of Xuzhou were rampant. The Xuzhou Garrison Commander, Song Runtian, sent Hao Jiajun, the commander of the first regiment of the first supplementary旅, to set off on the 29th to suppress the bandits westward from Jiagou Station. On the 30th, he joined forces with the police team and militia of Xiaosuo County to engage in fierce fighting with the bandits in the Xikou area. The bandits were defeated and fled. 27 bandits were captured and executed on the spot, and more than 200 hostages were rescued. On the 31st, they pursued the bandits to Huangkou and the bandit atmosphere was pacified. The Hao regiment returned to defense on the 1st. The detailed circumstances of the bandit suppression were reported by Song Runtian to Chen Tiaoyuan in a telegram, stating that "Liu He探称 has ordered the entire third battalion and the two companies of the third battalion, as well as the two artillery pieces, to suppress the bandits and communists on the border of Jiangsu and Shandong. On the morning of the 29th, they set off westward from Jiagou to suppress them. The mountains in that area have always been a place for bandits to flee, but the bandits had already heard the news and fled westward, so the troops followed them to Xikou, which is 70 miles away. It was 10:00 p.m. when they learned that there were about 2,000 bandits with about 1,000 firearms, many of which were handheld automatic weapons, entrenched in the villages of Zhou Ao, Yang Zhuang, Wei Zhuang, and Tianjing, about 20 miles north of Suikou. At this time, the police teams of Xiaosuo and Su County had already followed up, but the bandits were too numerous and it was not convenient to advance in the dark. At midnight on the 30th, the troops launched an attack and ordered the Xiaoxian team to deploy on the northeast side and the Suxian team to deploy on the northwest side. The troops launched a fierce attack from the south at 9:00 a.m., and the bandits resisted stubbornly, suffering about 200 casualties. By 6:00 p.m., Zhou Ao, Yang Zhuang, and Wei Zhuang had been successively captured. The bandits were defeated and took advantage of the heavy rain to scatter in the east, west, and north directions. The bandit leader Sanmao Hou was injured on the spot. After pursuing for more than ten miles, the bandits were scattered and it was already dusk, so it was not convenient to pursue them to the end. It is estimated that more than 200 hostages were rescued, and all of them were handed over to Wei County Magistrate of Su County for investigation and distribution. 27 bandits were captured on the spot and executed on the spot. It was dangerous to find that the bandits were wearing the symbols of the Second Army Corps Garrison Army, and 5 rifles were seized. One officer and nine soldiers of the troops were injured, and two were killed in action. It was later learned that there were more than a hundred bandits fleeing north, so they were followed up, but the bandits had already collapsed. In addition to ordering the county magistrates of Xiaosuo and Su County to be responsible for clearing them, it is planned to lead the troops back to防 from Huangkou on the evening of the east. The details are telegraphed for inspection. Song Runtian, humbly. "</p>
<h3 id="e139">Liaoning Province to Establish Large-Scale Woolen Mill <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Zhang Zhenlu, the Finance Commissioner of the Liaoning Provincial Government, intends to sell off all official properties in the province's counties to fund the establishment of a large-scale woolen mill, aiming to develop industries and stem financial leakages. This proposal was presented at today's Provincial Government Committee meeting and was approved. The proposal is recorded as follows: "It has been found that although the official properties in each county of this province are under the strict custody of the county governments according to provincial orders, and the leasing and reporting are properly recorded, the rental income from these properties is quite low, with limited annual revenue. Furthermore, the buildings, many of which are former Qing Dynasty banner offices, have deteriorated over the years. If we want to preserve them in the long run, we must repair them continuously. However, the province's monthly revenue is already struggling to cover military and administrative expenses, leaving no surplus funds for house repairs. Moreover, the meager rent from the outer counties is insufficient even for repairs, making them unprofitable. If we allow them to collapse, the existing rooms will inevitably disappear, and the revenue from official properties will gradually decrease to nothing. Since the official properties in each county cannot be preserved for long, it would be more advantageous to sell them together with the official land at an assessed value. However, if the proceeds from the sale are treated as general revenue for military and administrative expenses, it would not only fail to compensate for the revenue from official properties, but also be an improper approach. In Western countries, no effort is spared when it comes to industrial matters. Taking woolen goods as an example, the raw materials are mostly purchased from our country, and after the goods are made, they are sold back to our country. In one transfer, our cash is absorbed by them. Therefore, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions, promote the woolen industry, and establish woolen mills to stem the leakages and save the situation. Moreover, the northeastern provinces are the leading producers of livestock in the country. Purchasing the raw materials for woolen goods locally is extremely convenient, and establishing factories would greatly benefit local commerce, society, and labor. Therefore, the establishment of woolen mills is not only urgently needed to resist imported goods, but also necessary to promote industry and provide employment. The Commissioner is aware of this and has long planned to establish such mills. However, due to the lack of surplus funds and the difficulty of raising funds, as well as the large amount of funds required, the project has not been realized. Now, if the proceeds from the sale of official properties in each county are used to fund the establishment of woolen mills, it would be a win-win situation. For assessment purposes, the Commissioner has already ordered the counties to estimate and report the value of the properties. Except for those occupied by the county government, prisons, and tax bureaus, the remaining official houses and lands that can be sold are valued at approximately 2,028,700 silver dollars, while the annual rent is only 41,000 silver dollars. The low yield is already evident, making it better to sell them. In summary, the Commissioner has carefully considered this matter, and it seems that there is no better plan. The proceeds will be used for a legitimate industrial purpose, and woolen mills are still rare in the northeastern provinces. Once established, they will surely generate substantial profits, compensating for the revenue from official properties and ensuring a surplus. However, this matter is significant. To determine its feasibility, a list of official properties, land, values, and rents is respectfully submitted for public decision." (August 1st)</p>

<p>Approximately three to four hundred recovered wounded soldiers from the Sixth Rear Hospital in Anqing, after being inspected and approved by the Wounded Soldiers Management Committee, were decided to be transported to the front lines to return to service. Yesterday, they were loaded onto small steamers such as the "Xin Sheng He" and sailed down the river towards Nanjing.</p>
<p>The opposition from all sectors in Hefei to the collection of field, land, and tobacco seedling taxes has led fellow villagers in Wuhu to appeal to the National Government and the Provincial Government. Recently, the county sent representatives to Wuhu to, together with Gong Xinzhan, Yuan Doushu, and others from Hefei in Wuhu, petition the Provincial Government to waive the taxes.</p>
<p>Lu Xueshu, the commander of the Capital Garrison Regiment, has been appointed by the Anhui Provincial Bandit Suppression Headquarters as the Commander of the Sixth Bandit Suppression District. It is heard that the command headquarters will be located in Wuhu, and the regimental headquarters will also move to Wuhu in the coming days.</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce previously submitted a request to the Provincial Government to abolish the rapeseed export tax. The Provincial Government replied that the rapeseed tax was requested by local authorities to prevent trade with Japan, and the collection was intended as a prohibition. The request was rejected.

<p>Following the robbery and kidnapping in Hougang Town, a township under the county, on the 30th of last month, including the robbery of police equipment, it has been learned that before the robbery, Sun Yaosheng, a wealthy household in the town, received a letter signed "Wang" demanding 4,000 yuan. Sun kept it secret and moved his family away on the same day, taking valuables with them. The kidnapping of three people and the robbery of police equipment on the 30th were likely a demonstration against Sun. Xu Jiru, who was kidnapped and taken to the Shuiting area of Hengluo Creek, was ordered by the bandits to go ashore and return to the town, and was instructed to notify the Wang family to prepare a ransom of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Before leaving, Xu was given one yuan for boat fare and returned home the next morning. The two sons of the Wang family, one seven years old and the other only two, who were just learning to speak, are still with the bandits. The family is unable to raise such a huge sum. It is heard that yesterday, the Sun Yaosheng family received another letter from the bandits demanding money as before, and threatening to choose between blood debt and money debt. If the money debt is not settled in Shanghai by the 8th, the entire family will be killed and the house burned. Currently, those with some wealth in the town have mostly moved away. The market is desolate, and there is a general feeling of panic.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Detailed Account of Wang Wusheng's Escape from Danger <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Following Water Police 8th Route Bandit Suppression Team Leader Wang Wusheng's escape from Taihu Lake, details of the events are given below: The lake bandits were divided into the Haizhou gang and the Henan gang. The leader of the Haizhou gang was Zhong Zhaokui, also known as Haizhou Laoba, age 30, with thick eyebrows and a narrow face, and a lean and agile body. He had committed major crimes in Tongcheng, Anhui, and other places. He had 18 boats, 160 men, and complete firearms. The Henan gang was led by Liu Ada and Zhang Kuzi, with 70 men in 10 boats. The bandits wore uniforms and had both long and short guns, as well as military flags and bugles. Zhong's gang had two inspectors, two secretaries, and three fake battalion commanders. Last month, after looting two steamships, the bandit boats gathered at Nanku that night, totaling 28 boats. While passing Miaotou, they captured Hu Rongshan and Zhang Si, Zhejiang detectives, and found two official documents on them. They were shot dead in Nanku and then their boats were dismantled and hidden in the reeds. The bandit boats traveled covertly at night, and their range was around Majia Dang, Xin Kai Lu, Hengshan, Caogang, Nanku, Hengxu, and Da Caogang. After Wang was captured, he was held on a boat of the Henan gang. Zheng Xin, son of the commander of the Dongshan Self-Defense Corps, was also captured and held by the Henan gang. Zhong Zhaokui, fearing pursuit by the police, considered killing Wang three times, but the Henan gang dissuaded him, hoping to use him to pressure the police. The Henan gang was weaker than the Haizhou gang and was often suppressed. For example, in past lootings, the Henan gang received one share for each gun, while the Haizhou gang received double. Zhong was stubborn and brutal, killing without hesitation. One day, when the bandit gang ran out of food, the Henan gang planned to go to Nanku to buy food. Zhong, fearing attention from the police, forbade it. The Henan gang eventually sent Liu Gong and two other bandits. Zhong immediately ordered them to be shot dead. As a result, the relationship between the two gangs had already turned sour. Before the water police's 7th and 8th teams engaged in a firefight with the bandits, the bandits at Xinwei (i.e., Tiandatan) saw a large fishing boat approaching from the northwest, followed by numerous small boats. Zhong knew something was amiss and told those around him that the "dogs" (bandits referred to police as dogs) were coming. But he said they were not afraid and ordered the men to raise the flags and bugles, ready to resist, saying they would seize their weapons. He then said they could "shake" Wang Wusheng (bandit slang for killing). The Henan gang hesitated slightly, but Zhong drew his short gun and fired at Wang from across the boat. Because the boats were moving at that time, the aim was inaccurate, and the bullet went straight to a bandit leader in the Henan gang. The bandit leader was shocked and quickly dodged, but a group standing next to him was killed. The bandit leader was enraged, believing that Zhong was deliberately seeking revenge. He released Wang, tied him to the boat, found a box of ammunition, gave it to Wang, and gave Zheng Xin a tube gun, ordering the two to shoot at the Haizhou gang with the other bandits. Wang, finding it inconvenient to fight in the water, ordered the Henan bandits to go ashore together. The bandit gang consisted of fifty-two men. Wang, leaning against the embankment, fired non-stop. At the same time, the water police, fighting the Haizhou gang, were joined by the boats of the 11th, 14th and 15th teams led by Captain Huai, and a "triangular battle" ensued. As a result, the Haizhou gang was defeated, outnumbered and attacked from two sides. The fifty-two men of the Henan gang, realizing that they could no longer cooperate with Zhong, immediately disbanded. Wang and Zheng found a boat and sailed away, intending to return to Wujiang, but the police of the other teams, suspecting that Wang and others were bandits, chased after them, firing bullets like rain. Wang did not have time to distinguish them and suspected that the water police were bandits (because the boats used by the water police were often disguised, and the bandits also wore uniforms). He only ordered the small boat to move forward quickly. Because the boat was slow, the bullets came closer and closer, so they abandoned it and walked, swimming across a river to Nanku, and then wading across another river to reach Wujiang at about 4 pm on the 4th. Later, the water police found four incomplete corpses floating in Taihu Lake near Xinkai Lu. Upon close examination, they were identified as two men and two women. The female corpses had small feet and were naked from the waist up. Their chests and abdomens had been cut open, and their hearts had been removed. One corpse was headless, and the heads and hands of the two male corpses had been cut off. The scene was horrifying. District Chief Gong returned to Suzhou on the night of the 5th, and Wang also returned with him. He reported the situation to the Second District Department in Suzhou and then went to Wuxi. The water police of the 2nd District, 9th, 10th and 6th brigades entered Taihu Lake to assist the 3rd District water police in searching for the fleeing bandits and rescuing the remaining hostages.</p>

<p>The Public Security Bureau received a secret letter accusing Xu Hengbo, who resided at No. 77 Qianqi Street, Wuxian County, of complicity with bandits in Changshu. The detective team was ordered to go to the address, but no Xu Hengbo was found at No. 77. According to records, Xu Hengbo, a former judicial staff member of the Public Security Bureau, was in charge of the county detention center. He previously lived at No. 54 Heng Street and has now moved to Xue Shi Street. The detective team reported that the letter accusing Xu Hengbo did not provide details, so they have submitted the investigation report to the Public Security Bureau for review.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Panic Over Sudden Rise in Rice Prices Again <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, the rice price in Wuxi has been gradually rising uncontrollably, causing panic among the common people who live on grains. Until recently, a week ago, due to the arrival of new Ke Xian rice and foreign rice in large quantities, the rice price continued to fall. High-quality white rice fell to 16.23 yuan per shi. Unexpectedly, the rice price has suddenly risen again in the past few days. Yesterday, the opening price of No. 1 high-quality white rice was 17.7 yuan, small ground rice was 14.7 yuan, and Saigon rice was 16.23 yuan. It is heard that the reason for this increase is the scarcity of goods and the strong sales in Shanghai. The unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate are all overjoyed.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Police Arresting People at Night Causes Trouble <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Tang Yingchuan, a farmer from Qianxiang Village, Fuzhou Township, 15th District, had a quarrel with his clansman Tang Fugen this summer and filed a complaint with the county government accusing Fugen of damaging property. The county government issued a warrant for his arrest, but he has not been apprehended. Recently, the 15th branch of the Public Security Bureau was established in the district. Tang Yingchuan believed that the opportunity had come and went to the Yuqi Town branch on the evening of the 5th with his son Amao to report and request the arrest. Huang Sheng, the head of the branch, sent six policemen with guns and Tang and others to make the arrest. When they arrived at the village, it was about 3 a.m. In a rush, they mistakenly knocked on the door of Hu Xiaofa, who lived next to Tang Fugen. After entering Hu's house, they realized the mistake and immediately withdrew. However, Hu's daughters Ayun and Afeng were both frightened and became ill, and the door panels were damaged. Although Hu negotiated with Tang Yingchuan and others at the time, there was no result. After the police withdrew from Hu's house, they opened the back door of Fugen's house and searched extensively, arresting Fugen and taking him to the bureau. Hu's father, Rui Fu, who was 67 years old, was terrified. Afterwards, he saw that the sundries in the room were discarded on the ground, and ten silver dollars and two thousand copper coins hidden in the empty rice bin and broken cotton quilt were also gone. Huang, the head of the branch, prepared a document on the morning of the 6th and sent police by motorboat to send Fugen to the County Public Security Bureau in the city for interrogation. Hu Xiaofa believes that Tang Yingchuan should not have led the police to damage the door of another person and scare the children, and is preparing to file a formal complaint.</p>

<p>In order to compensate for the losses caused by the installation of automatic switchboards, the telephone company recently notified all subscribers that the price for telephone lines in shops would increase by one yuan, and the price for telephone lines in households and organizations would increase by half a yuan.

Shen, the clerk who caused the incident, had already returned to the office and took the opportunity to steer the situation by apologizing to the public and accompanying Xu A Hui to the Weisheng Hospital for treatment. The matter was settled.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Private Grain Transportation Resolved with Fine <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The rice price in the urban area has fallen sharply in recent days, approaching 10 yuan. Poor households were rejoicing at the relief, but unexpectedly, the price suddenly increased by seven cents on the evening of the 2nd, which alarmed everyone. On the morning of the 3rd, the county party headquarters received a report that Che Fu Dan and Che Wen Gui, father and son from the Zhen Kang Rice Shop outside the east gate, were manipulating the rice price, monopolizing the market, and transporting rice out of the county in batches. After investigation, it was confirmed that a boat loaded with rice was being transported to Tang Pu, Shao Xing. The police officers were dispatched to Wupo Ling and intercepted the boat. Wu Shao Qi and two other rice merchants on the boat went ashore to hide. The seized rice amounted to twenty-two bags, each containing one shi and six dou, totaling thirty-five shi, worth 350 yuan. The department convened a meeting with party and government officials and business representatives. As a result, considering their ignorance, they were leniently dealt with and ordered the Zhen Kang Rice Shop to pay a fine of 70 yuan (50 yuan to compensate for the grain consumption deficit in the first district and 20 yuan to reward the informant). They also required a guarantee that they would not privately transport grain again. The seized cargo ship was returned. However, the local people were still dissatisfied and planned to jointly request strict legal action to warn unscrupulous merchants.</p>
<p>Letter Received</p>
<h3 id="e184">Letter from Cheng Bingyao <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>I recently read in the "Important News" section of your newspaper on July 4th about the joint attack by the Fujian Sea and Land Army on Lu's troops. At the end, it mentioned that the defense of Shaowu and Jianou and other areas in the rear was undertaken by the two regiments of Huang Qingcai and Cheng Bingyao, implying that Lu Xingrong did not trust these two regiments from Minqing. After reading this, I was very surprised. Cheng Bingyao's ancestral home is Gutian. Since resigning from the position of regimental commander in the summer of the 17th year, I have been dedicated to education. Last summer, I returned to Gutian and was appointed as the director of the Guping Branch Road Engineering Office by the Fujian Construction Department last winter. Since then, I have only been involved in road planning and have not been involved in other affairs. The report in your newspaper must be based on rumors and is inaccurate. I am writing this special letter to request an immediate correction. Sincerely, Cheng Bingyao, July 20, Year 19</p>

<h3 id="e185">Insufficient Rice Supply <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Difficult to Export</p>
<p>Recently, the Municipal Government of this city received letters from the Qingdao Municipal Government requesting permission to export rice. However, considering that the population of this city is increasing year by year and the food supply depends entirely on Su rice, which is already insufficient, it is difficult to export. A letter was sent to Qingdao City yesterday stating: We acknowledge the receipt of your government's official letters No. 3750 and No. 4025, stating that according to the Qingdao General Chamber of Commerce, Hongshengxiang Company intends to purchase white rice in Shanghai to supply the people of Qingdao, temporarily limited to 1,000 dan per month, and requests a special permit for a one-year trial period. The Social Affairs Bureau also requested the transfer of rice to Qingdao to relieve the people's food shortage and requested permission to export and issue a passport, allowing 2,000 bags of rice to be transported each month. After investigation, this city is not a rice-producing area, and the population is increasing year by year. The food supply depends almost entirely on Su rice, and there is no surplus for export. Therefore, it is difficult to handle the Japonica rice. However, foreign rice and Ke Xian rice can be re-exported. Historically, various provinces and cities have come to Shanghai to purchase foreign rice. The rice merchants first submit the rice amount purchased to the provincial and municipal governments for approval and issuance of passports, which are then taken to the Social Affairs Bureau of this city for verification before release. Therefore, we are responding to your letter and requesting that you inform us accordingly. This is addressed to the Qingdao Municipal Government.</p>

<p>Three Ships - Momo, Yanagi, and Kashi</p>
<p>Hinoki to Enter Port This Morning</p>
<p>Fully Prepared for Combat</p>
<p>The Japanese Ministry of Navy, citing the pretext of banditry on the Yangtze River to protect Japanese residents, suddenly ordered the four ships of the Sasebo 24th Destroyer Squadron, Momo, Yanagi, Kashi, and Hinoki, to sail to China for defense on the day before yesterday. Three ships, Momo, Kashi, and Yanagi, arrived successively at 5:30 PM yesterday. After entering the port, they were anchored at the Pudong naval buoys and the Whampoo Wharf. The Hinoki will enter port this morning (the 7th). In addition to the original officers and soldiers, each warship carries more than 300 specially selected naval landing troops. In addition to one captain on each ship, Yanagihara was also appointed as the commander to lead the ships. The warships are all painted fish white, and the equipment, food, and coal are abundant, fully prepared for combat emergencies. They will sail to various ports on the Yangtze River as soon as the second order is issued. The above warships have all sailed on the Yangtze River during the last large-scale Japanese warship visit to China, so they are very familiar with the Yangtze River voyage. Currently, Changsha has been recovered, and the Hunan-Hubei bandits and communists have been suppressed by the central government. It is reported that all levels of party headquarters and public organizations are protesting this alarming action by the Japanese and requesting the central government to ban it.</p>

<p>New Model Arrived</p>
<p>According to financial circles, the government recently ordered a new national currency model from a certain country, which has been manufactured and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for appraisal. It is said that the style is similar to the ordinary national currency circulating in the market, with the Prime Minister's portrait on the front and a pattern similar to the stamp pattern on the back, with a sailboat and the words "National Currency of the Republic of China," but without any foreign characters. This coin model has been stored by the Beijing Mint and will be decided whether to implement a virtual gold standard after the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce have discussed it. If the virtual gold standard cannot be implemented, then this new model national currency will be ordered by the mint to cast coins, which can be issued in the shortest period of time. If the virtual gold standard is implemented, then another type of coin model will be required.</p>

Items two and three have been submitted to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for forwarding and have not yet been replied.

They are exempt from paying all other donations when sold in the mainland. The Ministry previously received a report from the Zhejiang Yongjia Silk and Cloth Industry Association requesting the cessation of the re-levy of cloth donations in Zhejiang. An order has been issued to the Zhejiang Department of Finance for investigation and handling. We are now telegraphing the details to you to check and inform us.

<h3 id="e196">Transportation Association Submits a Document to the City Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Request to Cancel Increased Deposit Payment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Jinghu Road Transportation Association submitted a document to the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: We received a letter from the Pukou Transportation Association on July 25th, which received a telegram from the Pukou Stationmaster stating that the Transportation Bureau had transferred it to all transporting merchants, who have all seen that the bureau had previously amended the regulations on vehicle requests by merchants due to the fact that merchants along the line often set up shops for speculation and requested vehicles to control freight transport. The amount of security deposit to be paid was stipulated according to the starting station, etc., and was promulgated and implemented in April of the tenth year. However, since the implementation of the regulations, the amount of the security deposit was too low, resulting in merchants still being mixed and uneven. Whenever empty cars arrive at the station, there are many people requesting them. For example, the Bengbu station has more than 70 companies vying for vehicles. At this time of frequent military transportation, the demand exceeds the supply. Even after the military situation is settled, it will still be difficult to cope with it. In order to strictly prevent control, false reports, and to reorganize freight transportation, the Beijiang Grade A Pukou and other four stations will increase by 2,000 yuan per station, the Grade B Chu Dan and other eleven stations will increase by 1,000 yuan per station, and the Grade C Wuyi and other seventeen stations will increase by 500 yuan per station. The increased funds will be paid in full before September 10th. The Bureau will give merchants who increase the payment of this deposit within the time limit the right to allocate vehicles first. Those who do not comply with the payment will not enjoy the right to allocate vehicles in advance. We are informing you and requesting that you check and handle the matter and not wait and see and delay your own affairs. Our association has held a meeting to discuss the matter. All members agreed that the industry has been repeatedly affected by military affairs, and the supply of Jinpu vehicles for military use has caused the companies to lose money. In the previous year, they complied with the payment of 1 million yuan in public bonds for purchasing cars, and in the previous year, they increased the payment of a total of 500,000 yuan in security deposits for requesting cars. The purchase and requisition of cars are closely related, so they had to comply with the order to pay. Until now, the interest that should be paid is still being deferred. Most of the money paid by the companies comes from loans. The Bureau does not care for them and limits the time to increase the deposit, and its name is reorganization, and the time limit for increasing the payment is given the right to allocate vehicles in advance. In other words, the security deposit paid in the previous year is equal to a waste. Moreover, recently there is not only no whole car available for allocation, but even small-volume goods are piled up in Pukou, and the losses of the transporters cannot be overstated. Even the car requisition security deposit paid in the previous year has not benefited the companies. Continuing to persevere in the future is no less than putting all transporters to death. In addition to the companies jointly requesting the Pukou Nanning Transportation Industry Association to request the Ministry of Railways to order the Jinpu Railway Bureau to cancel the increased deposit payment and to reorganize the vehicles to deal with freight transportation to alleviate commercial difficulties, and to check the news report on July 29th in which the Ministry of Industry and Commerce proposed a transportation facilitation program with a total of eight points. The fourth point of the eight points, "Strictly prohibit extractions of transportation fees," coincides with the clause in the Jinpu Railway Bureau's order to increase the deposit payment. The opinions of the Ministry of Railways have been submitted to the National Government for review, and the State Council has decided to transfer them to the administrative authorities to take responsibility for handling the matter. Our association has reported the situation to each company and hereby requests your association to send a telegram to the Ministry of Railways to give preferential treatment to the transporters, to quickly order the Jinpu Bureau to cancel the increased deposit payment, to reorganize the vehicles, to dredge the freight transport, and to ask the Ministry to expedite the apportionment of the interest from the car requisition security deposit and the car purchase public bond interest from the previous year to maintain credit and alleviate commercial difficulties.</p>

<p>Negotiations with the Factory Yesterday Were Unsuccessful</p>
<h3 id="e201">Negotiation Situation <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The strike by French merchant water and electricity workers has dragged on for nearly two months. Although the authorities have intervened several times, no results have been achieved. Recently, the French Consul has been responsible for mediation, but the extent of the mediation and the date of the completion of the resolution are still unknown. Workers believe that although this prolonged strike is a struggle against imperialism, some sacrifices are unavoidable, but prolonged delays are not a long-term solution. The mediators find the proceedings difficult and unusually difficult. Therefore, in the previous general meeting, it was unanimously decided to elect eight representatives to go to the factory yesterday morning to ask the manager, M. Menssolon, about the situation. In the morning, M. Menssolon was unable to meet with them due to other important matters. They made an appointment to go at 3:00 PM. The representatives of the union included two people from the Chinese staff department, two people from the writing department, two people from the transportation department, and two people from the mechanical department. They went to the meeting as scheduled at 3:00 PM and were received by M. Menssolon. The representatives then asked M. Menssolon about the attitude he would take regarding the matter based on the opinions of the general meeting. M. Menssolon said that the union had requested intervention from the Central Government and could ask the Central Government about the attitude. He was very tough and said that he could not accept the opinions of the representatives at all. The representatives then told the manager that no matter how the Central Government mediated or how the French Consul proceeded, they must give a satisfactory answer within two days before leaving. When the two sides were in contact, the factory was heavily guarded.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Union Attitude <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The union had originally planned to convene a general meeting of all employees at the Public Sports Field after negotiating with the manager yesterday, but the negotiation time was changed to 3:00 PM, so the meeting was temporarily cancelled and changed to a partial meeting at the union at 5:00 PM. After the negotiations broke down, the workers were extremely angry and unanimously stated that they would not stop until they reached their goal. Chen Pu Ai was dispatched to the Support Association to report the situation and decided on three cases: (1) The foreman of the paint workshop, Chen, was accused of disrupting strike discipline and was handed over to the interrogation section for investigation by the disciplinary team. (2) Request the Municipal Party Department to resolve the labor dispute as soon as possible. (3) Anyone who disrupts the union will be investigated by union members and dealt with forcefully.</p>

<p>Because this labor dispute has been prolonged, the supporting committee convened a special meeting at the Municipal Party Headquarters, third floor, yesterday at 1 p.m. More than three hundred representatives from various labor unions in the city attended. Hu Shouqi, Zhang Yaoming, and Chen Peide were elected as the presidium, with Ye Yunping as the recorder. After the ritual greetings, the chairman reported on the situation of support. Subsequently, Xu A'mei, a representative from the French Water and Electricity Workers' Union, reported on the course of the recent strike and the facts of the "July 21st Tragedy." She also made a definite statement regarding the recent arrest of two members of the union's executive committee, Wang A'gen and Su Jiliang. Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, originally planned to attend the meeting to report, but was prevented by an unforeseen circumstance. The assembly sent representatives to his residence to make contact. Then the assembly discussed the proposals: (1) To organize a city-wide labor support committee to issue a strong declaration regarding the "July 21st Tragedy." Twenty-one representatives from the supporting committee groups were elected on the spot, including Yu Yaoqiu from the Taikang Food Workers' Union, Zhang Yaoming from the Nanhua Reception Workers' Union, Zhang Linhua from the Xiang Sheng Iron Factory Workers' Union, Ye Gonglun from the Shanghai-Ningbo Steamboat Crew Union, Gu Yongquan from the Mercerizing and Dyeing Workers' Union, Chen Peide from the British-American Tobacco Factory Workers' Union, Wang Wenhua from the Commercial Workers Union, Xu Shaochuan from the Southern Goods Workers Union, Weng Ruifu from the Sauce Industry Workers Union, Li Yongxiang from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Workers Union, Ge Yunting from the Cotton Weaving Workers Union, Zhu Shaoyun from the Dyeing Industry Workers Union, Hu Shouqi from the Calligraphy and Fan Workers Union, Fan Pusheng from the Commercial Workers Union, Zhao Zhenhui from the Pharmaceutical Industry Workers Union, Mei Guozhen from the Newspaper Delivery Workers Union, He Che from the Chinese and Foreign Cloth Industry Workers Union, Lu Jingshi from the Postal Workers Union, Zhou Xuexiang from the Huacheng Tobacco Workers Union, Tang Junsheng from the Chinese Water and Electricity Workers Union, and Long Peiyun from the Qiuxin Shipyard Workers Union. The presidium convened a temporary meeting with the above representatives to discuss and decide to issue a declaration in the name of the committee, to be drafted by Cai Xiaohe. (2) Yu Yaoqiu proposed sending letters to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting guarantees against the arrest of French Water and Electricity workers. It was resolved to submit the request to the Party Headquarters for transmission. (3) It was resolved that the assembly would send three representatives to inquire about the mediation situation from Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, together with representatives from the French Water and Electricity Workers Union. Gu Yongquan, Lu Jingshi, and Hu Shouqi were immediately elected to go. (4) It was resolved to assist the French Electric Company Workers Union with economic problems. In addition to the already issued order that each worker donate one jiao, further assistance would be provided by each labor union as much as possible. All the above resolutions were passed. Chen Puwen, who was in contact with the factory, also arrived and immediately reported on the progress. All the representatives were indignant. Xia Menghuan, a representative from the Japanese-Chinese Workers Union, also reported on the Japanese factory's abuse of workers and the recent labor disputes. It was also resolved to provide unanimous assistance and issue a declaration in the name of the assembly to provide support. The meeting was adjourned after guidance from representatives of the Municipal Department.</p>

<p>[P Upstream Cargo Shipment</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, tens of thousands of pieces of cargo destined for Hunan that were blocked and returned to Hankou. Even goods from Yichang could not be shipped. The unloading of upstream cargo was almost completely blocked. Yesterday, a Shanghai-based steamship company received a telegram from Hankou stating that the Communist bandits in Changsha had been defeated by the Central Army and that navigation on the Hunan-Hubei waterway had resumed. The steamship's blocked cargo had already departed from Hankou for Changsha, and Yichang was resuming normal loading and unloading.

<p>Chinese shipping merchants in Yichang telegraphed various steamship companies in Shanghai yesterday, stating that the Chinese steamships on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have been suspended for a long time, and Chinese shipping has been completely taken over by foreign steamships. Not only have Chinese shipping merchants suffered huge losses, but they are also unable to maintain the current situation. Now that transportation is gradually decreasing, they request that Shanghai shipping merchants consult with the Communications Department to release three or four steamships to resume routes to Yichang, Shashi, and Chongqing in order to relieve the livelihoods of the shipping industries in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Current Situation of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Since Cai Pei took office as the acting director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, he has continued to implement the old system in the bureau's affairs. Recently, as the acting term is about to expire, he is unwilling to hold the position for a long time and has gone to Beijing to resign to Minister Wang. Regarding the various affairs in the bureau, Cai specially ordered the secretariat to issue an edict, entrusting the heads of each department to take full responsibility for handling their respective affairs in order to await the arrival of official personnel from the central government to take over the bureau. Because the bureau's economy is of utmost importance, the chief accountant, Hong Yanbin, has submitted his resignation, but Cai has retained him, urging him to do his best and not to resign rashly.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Guangli Can Escape Danger <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Guangli steamship ran aground on Gelan Island below the Parrot Island in the upper reaches of Hankou. Repeated attempts to tow it have been unsuccessful. The crew and sailors have all left the ship and transferred to Shanghai. The Wuhan authorities have been requested to send troops to protect it. Since it ran aground, it has been two weeks. Due to the shallow water and difficulty in towing, they have been waiting for the tide to rise. Yesterday, they received a telegram from the steamship stating that the water level on Gelan Island has risen by more than a foot.  The Hankou branch was requested to send the Lijia steamship to tow it. It is hoped that it can be pulled out of the shallow water today and towed to Shanghai for major repairs.</p>
<p>[P Flying Tiger Salvaged Again</p>
<p>The Sanbei's Flying Tiger steamship was sunk by a warship on the Hankou Jiang'an River on February 22nd. The bureau immediately entrusted the Shanghai Rongchang Development Company to salvage it. It was not easy to rescue it immediately. On the one hand, it requested the headquarters to recognize the loss for compensation. This matter has been going on for more than five months. Now it is heard that the headquarters has agreed to酌认赔款 [Consider Approving Compensation], and the salvage project has gradually become effective recently, and it is hoped that it can be rescued. Therefore, work is continuing in these days.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Haimen County Closes All Ports <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>To Prevent Bandit Troubles and Clear Bandit Sources</p>
<p>The Shipping Association Notifies Fellow Traders</p>
<p>The Shipping Association of this port sent a letter to Jufeng, Xinlong, Dada, Ping'an, Daxing, and other companies yesterday, stating: "We hereby inform you that we have received a document from the Haimen County Chamber of Commerce, sealed and sent by the Haimen County Government, regarding the closure of all ports to prevent bandit troubles. We are now enclosing a copy of this document for your reference and compliance." Attached is Haimen County Government Order No. 445, which states: "In order to comply with the order, this government's 48th County Administration Conference discussed Public Security Bureau Chief Hao Zhiying's proposal. The coastal area of Hai County is adjacent to the river, and the ports are scattered. Bandits come and go frequently, and smuggled goods such as firearms are often brought into the country, endangering public security. In the past, it was proposed at the County Administration Conference to close the ports, which is indeed an important way to eliminate troubles. However, due to the obstruction of transportation, it was not possible to close all of them. Two methods are proposed: (1) Lingdian Port, Qinglong Port, Daxin Port, Songji Port, and Niuhong Port are important transportation ports and should not be closed. It is proposed that the police stationed at various public security sub-bureaus and outposts should strictly inspect them, and the county government should order the district chiefs of each district to instruct the township chiefs along the port and notify the water police to cooperate in strict patrols. (2) Material closure of ports with small ports, sparse ships, and insufficient police patrols, such as Yuehe Port, Lao Ji Port, Yueya Port, Taiping Port, Jiepai Port, and other small ports, will be the responsibility of the public security sub-bureaus and outposts to close with various materials. The required materials will be purchased by the Property Division. Whether the above two methods are applicable, such as Da'an Port, which is wide and large, but is a gathering place for bandits, has already been included in the closure list. However, there is a customs office at that place. If the port is closed, will it affect the national tax revenue? All should be submitted for discussion." It was resolved: "(1) Do not close each port, and order them to be handled separately according to the case. (2) The county government should issue a notice prohibiting ships from passing through the ports that should be closed, and order the district offices to instruct the township chiefs of each port to send two secret agents to each port to inspect at any time. If any ships are found entering or leaving, report them immediately to the nearest public security bureau or outpost for detention, and give preferential rewards." In addition to issuing notices and orders separately, it is hereby ordered that the association comply and notify all ship owners that all ports previously prohibited from closing should temporarily suspend berthing in order to clear bandit sources. If anyone dares to disobey, they will be heavily fined without leniency. This order is urgent."</p>

<p>Meeting to be Held to Discuss Fundraising Methods</p>
<p>The lower reaches of the Wusong River are silted up with mud and sand, and the river water is shallow, causing many obstructions to ships traveling back and forth. The Municipal Government of this city and various water conservancy agencies once convened a meeting to prepare for dredging, but the project was so large and fundraising so difficult that no progress was made. It is now learned that the Construction Committee believes that if the Wusong River's silted waterway is not dredged as soon as possible, the sand and mud will inevitably become more and more silted, and water transportation will be more and more affected. Therefore, it has specially formulated a plan for dredging the Wusong River, and after review, it has been completed. Yesterday, the Municipal Finance Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Wusong Water Conservancy Association, the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, and other agencies of this city received letters from the Construction Committee requesting that each agency propose fundraising methods and send them to the committee in order to hold a meeting on a scheduled basis to discuss. Once the fundraising methods are properly discussed and finalized, the dredging of the Wusong River will begin.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industries to Comply</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to all trade associations yesterday, stating: "We hereby inform you that we have received Order No. 2635 from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs on August 1, which was issued by the Municipal Government, which in turn was issued by the Executive Yuan, which in turn was issued by the Central Executive Committee's Letter No. 10259, forwarding three measures for the reorganization of merchant groups in various places, ordering compliance. Articles 1, 2, and 3 of these measures are different from the situation in this city and will not be described in detail. All Article 1 states that the reorganization of merchant groups in Zhejiang, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and other provinces and cities that have been approved by the central merchant group guidance and reorganization agencies should be completed within the time limit approved by the National Government in accordance with the approved laws and procedures. We have forwarded the order to the association. The Law on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations was promulgated by the National Government on August 17, 1929. According to Article 14 of this law, trade associations established in accordance with this law should be reorganized in accordance with this law within one year after the implementation of this law. Therefore, all trade associations in this city should complete their reorganization by August 16 of this year. Before receiving the order, we hereby issue a notice urging all trade associations to formally complete their reorganization within the statutory time limit and not to delay any further. This is of utmost importance."</p>

<h3 id="e213">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests That Soldiers Be Ordered to Vacate the Association's Premises <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters yesterday, stating: "We hereby inform you that the premises of the Shanghai Steel and Tin Trade Association (formerly the Steel and Tin Trade Guild) have been occupied by soldiers of the 28th Regiment of the 14th Brigade of the 5th Division. Reorganization and restructuring are impossible, and the association's affairs are difficult to handle. In April of this year, the former Chamber of Commerce reported the situation and requested evacuation. It was approved and forwarded to the regiment to find another location. The association was notified when a location was found. Now, the Reorganization Committee of the Trade Association has sent a letter stating that the Trade Association has received orders from the ministry to complete the reorganization according to law within a time limit, but the association's premises are still occupied by soldiers, and there is no place to hold meetings, so it cannot proceed. It was previously indicated that the premises of each trade association and the recruitment of soldiers by labor unions should not be arbitrarily occupied, and it has been resolved by the representatives of the members to send letters to the respective orders. It is now the association's premises, and the aforementioned soldiers have not yet moved out. We hereby report again, hoping that you will earnestly forward the request for evacuation as soon as possible so that the reorganization can be completed as soon as possible." After investigation, the Law on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations was promulgated on August 17, 1929. According to Article 14 of this law, trade associations established in accordance with this law should be reorganized within one year after the implementation of this law. Now that the deadline is approaching, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has repeatedly forwarded orders from the ministry to reorganize according to the time limit and forward them for compliance. The Trade Association cannot proceed with the reorganization due to the occupation of the association's premises. It is impossible to comply with the ministry's order to reorganize according to the time limit, and it is impossible to proceed with the association's affairs and maintain the merchants' interests. Furthermore, it is forbidden to recruit soldiers and others to occupy the premises of the Trade Association without permission. The Gui Ministry has previously sent a letter ordering compliance. Now, the soldiers of the regiment have been occupying the premises for a long time and have not moved out, which is inconsistent with the Gui Ministry's intention to order compliance. We hereby report the situation and request that you examine and approve it and quickly forward the order to the regiment's soldiers to evacuate by a certain date in order to maintain sovereignty and sincerity. This is addressed to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Hunan Fellow Villagers Association sent a telegram to the Central News Agency, forwarding it to all levels of Party Headquarters, all military and political leaders, all mass organizations, and all compatriots throughout the country: "Recently, Communist bandits have sprung up in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. Bandit leader Peng Dehuai gathered more than 10,000 people and captured Changsha on the night of July 27. The provincial government, the provincial Party Headquarters, various agencies, and all stores, banks, customs offices, public and private schools, and civilian houses in the city were all looted and then burned. The flames soared into the sky and have not stopped for days. The residents of the city, supporting the old and leading the young, fled in droves, but only 10,000 people escaped. The remaining 300,000 citizens, caught off guard and unable to escape, were killed in countless numbers. Corpses littered the ground, and blood flowed like a river. The tragedy is unprecedented. Changsha has not yet been recovered (note: Changsha was recovered on the 5th), and rumors are rife in Nanxun and Wuhan, causing panic. If this bandit force is not quickly suppressed, a red disaster will inevitably spread and poison the entire country. We hope that all our compatriots will rise up together to exterminate this giant bandit and appeal to the authorities to immediately send elite troops to suppress them in order to save the people of Hunan and ensure national security. We weep and present our urgent request, awaiting orders. All the fellow villagers in Shanghai bow down in support."</p>

<p>According to Sun Jinyin Tingdong, director of the Ninghai 工振 [Labor Relief] Department of the China Jishenghui, in a telegram from Ninghai, "I arrived in Ninghai last night to handle the 工 [Labor]. I walked three or four li on muddy roads, which was difficult to travel. When I arrived at the second branch, I was surprised to find that most of the people in the area were in the sea. It was learned that on the night of the day before last month, due to continuous heavy rains, a torrential flood suddenly broke out like a landslide, turning the entire area into a泽国 [Waterlogged Land]. From Baiqiao, 10 li east of the county, to Yuejing in the far east, from Dongyu, 20 li south of the county, to Huayu Jiankangtang in the far south, and from Qiaotouhu, 30 li north of the county, to Xiashan Jiajueke in the far north, each line stretches for hundreds of li or seventy or eighty li. There are no less than thousands of海 [Sea] ports. According to statistics, the塘田 [Pond Fields] reach more than one million mu, all of which have been收掇 [Cleared up] by 波臣 [God of Waves]. The survivors are less than two or three out of ten. Among the works repaired by the association, 72塘 [Ponds] inside and outside the Bainei of Zhongdu, Xiadu, and Youdu were breached by Qingye, causing damage to about 13,000 mu of rice fields and affecting more than 5,000 people whose livelihoods have been cut off. How can we relieve them in the long term? The 工振 [Labor Relief] for repairing the堤塘 [Dikes] in the area proposed by the association previously requires a three-fold increase in the estimated amount based on the current缺口线 [Gap Line] of more than one hundred places to complete the work. In addition to rushing to plug the breach to protect 민망 [Peoples Houses] and 민망 [Peoples Lives], it is necessary to find ways to increase relief money in order to save people and免填沟壑 [Avoid Filling Gullies]. "In addition, the county magistrate Tang Tiansen and the villagers of the 해 [Sea] villages in the east, south, and north three towns, and the village chiefs of Gudu and Zhongdu, sent telegrams to the same effect. The association found that the association's 工振 [Labor Relief] in Ninghai was already led by the previous Ninghai relief director, Sun Jinyin Ting, and Zhenyou Li Yunmen Xie Yu, who rushed to repair the堤塘 [Dikes] to prevent floods. Now, the堤塘 [Dikes] have been breached by sudden floods. According to the original budget, it is impossible to solve the problem without raising three times the amount. The association's public discussion of the difficulty of raising funds has reached the extreme, and there is only hope to do its best to fulfill its wishes. However, the sudden disaster cannot be saved by the original sole force. It is hoped that the compatriots in Zhejiang and the domestic charitable organizations will support and assist.</p>
<h3 id="e222">The Question of Lawyers' Uniforms Along the Border <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Differences between white silk and treasury silver</p>
<p>Lawyer Yao Wenshou put forward his opinions on the lawyers' uniforms to the Shanghai Lawyers Association, saying that it is not appropriate to replace white silk with treasury silver (commonly known as back-pattern silver) for the borders of lawyers' uniforms. According to the principle that lawyers should be clean, selfless, and not hold selfish interests first when performing their duties, the central government promulgated that the collars and edges of lawyers' uniforms should be made of white silk to show that lawyers are clean and flawless, which is a sign of respect for character and encouragement of integrity. Now, the association previously proposed to replace it with treasury silver, which, from a superficial point of view, seems to conform to the colors promulgated by the central government. However, it is my opinion that treasury silver, although it is also silk, inevitably contains gold and silver colors and cannot be considered pure white. Therefore, although it is magnificent, it does not conform to the original purpose. Moreover, it is said that lawyers' uniforms in the courts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces do not use treasury silver, and Shanghai is the only region that is unique, which may not be appropriate. Furthermore, the price difference between white silk and treasury silver is huge, and it is uneconomical to use it for edges. Therefore, I have put forward my opinions for public decision.</p>

The amount of the increase is almost three-tenths. The salary increase plan was decided by a special committee, and President Fessenden and Chairman MacLaren are powerful.</p>

<p>Shen Ke'er, a driver from Haimen of Yinghai Heji Automobile Company at 582 Zhonghua Road, Xiaonanmen, drove a truck with municipal government registration number 4313 to Zhabei on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at seven o'clock. On the way, when passing near Tanjiachiao and Pengpu New Bridge, Zhang Zhufa, a resident of Guanyintang No. 33, leading his eight-year-old adopted daughter Ge Lexiu, was walking slowly on the road. Since the sun had set and the sky was dark, he could not辨物 [Distinguish things]. Shen's car was driving very fast, and he did not see anyone at first. When he noticed, it was too late to brake, and he knocked down the girl Ge Lexiu,碾伤 [Crushing Injury] her head and neck, etc., with blood everywhere. She was killed on the spot. Seeing that he had caused the accident, Shen intended to escape at full speed, but he was鸣笛 [Sounded the Whistle] and chased by a passerby Zhang Jinshan. He was eventually arrested by members of the first 防所 [Defense Department] of the second guard team at the location, and together with the corpse, his father Zhang Zhufa, and witness Zhang Jinshan, he was sent to the fourth district總署 [Headquarters]. After interrogation by署长 [Director] Jin, he submitted the documents to the judicial section for核辦 [Review and Handling] yesterday.</p>

<p>Wu Zhou's son, Wu Genquan, nine years old, from No. 3 Huasheng Lane, Huasheng Road, Zhabei, was returning home from school for lunch on the day before yesterday, walking on the south side of the road. The motorist Wang A'gen drove illegally on the north side of the road, but instead of driving on the north side where he should have been, he drove on the south side. As a result, Wu Genquan suffered无妄之灾 [Unexpected Disaster] and was knocked down and碾毙 [Rolled to death]. Subsequently, the Fourth District Police Department arrested and detained Wang A'gen. Wang's family negotiated with Wu Zhou's family not to pursue the matter and paid a sum of money for damages. The woman requested not to pursue the matter, but the police department refused. They were transferred to the local court for interrogation and ordered the eleventh map保 [Guarantor] Shen Xiaohe to submit a report to the court for驗 [Inspection].</p>

<p>Fortunately Rescued by a Boatman</p>
<p>Lok Ming-tak, a 22-year-old from Ningbo, had been living in Hankou as a clerk at a customs brokerage. Recently, Lok's parents brought his 7-year-old younger sister to Shanghai. His father intended to find a proper job but had been lodging with relatives for several months without any news. Lok became anxious and took a steamer to Shanghai to inquire everywhere. Because the address of a certain relative was unclear, he was unable to find out where they were staying. After several days, he had spent all the money he had brought. His luggage and clothes were pawned for money. With no possessions and no money to return to Hankou, he was in a desperate situation. Out of desperation, at about 11 o'clock the previous evening, he went to the Dongjiadu waterfront in Nanshi and, taking advantage of the lack of attention, jumped into the Huangpu River to seek death. A boatman nearby saw him, rushed to his rescue, and pulled him ashore, saving his life. The boatman immediately reported the incident to the sixteenth district patrol post. Officer Feng Deng'an brought him back to the responsible First Section of the First District. After a preliminary interrogation by the Section Chief, Lok explained his situation. He was ordered to prepare a written statement to be submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for a decision.</p>

<p>Pang A-gen, a 34-year-old from Songjiang, had been working as a boatman, recently transporting watermelons to Shanghai for sale. Yesterday afternoon, at about 2 o'clock, his boat loaded with watermelons was sailing on the Bai Miao Gang River in Longhua when he saw a boat approaching from the front at high speed. Suddenly, five men on the boat shouted loudly, forcing him to stop. Pang and the others saw that these men were fierce and armed with guns. Fearing for their safety, they immediately stopped the boat. The men jumped aboard. One of them threatened them to remain silent and watched them closely. The others began to rob dozens of watermelons and five silver dollars. They then searched the boat thoroughly but found nothing else. They then carried the stolen goods to their boat. Pang, realizing he was being robbed, tried to resist. The guard fired a shot, fortunately missing him but grazing his leg. Pang, refusing to give up, rushed forward and hugged the guard, shouting for help. At that time, officers Liu Yutian and others from the First Precinct of the Third Division of the Municipal Police Bureau's Water Patrol Team happened to be patrolling the river. Hearing the shouts, they rushed over to investigate. They arrested the gunman, seizing a rifle and three bullets. The other men took the opportunity to row away and escape. They brought the captured person, the boat owner, and the witness Sun Bao-fa back to the precinct. After a brief interrogation by the patrol officer, they were transferred to the headquarters. During a preliminary interrogation by Chief Xu, the plaintiff Pang A-gen and the witness Sun Bao-fa recounted the incident. The defendant identified himself as Wang You-heng, 22 years old, from Xiangtan, Hunan Province, and a soldier in a certain battalion. He claimed he had heard that the boat was carrying smuggled goods, so he and four colleagues brought weapons and boarded the boat in plain clothes to inspect it. The Chief questioned why, if they were on official business, they were not in uniform. He also questioned how they dared to take silver and goods from the boat and shoot at people, causing injury. He found it difficult to believe. He ordered a written statement to be prepared and submitted to the Third Section of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>P Brawl Over House Sale Results in Injuries</p>
<p>Dong Bu-kun, a 25-year-old factory worker from Gaoyou, residing at 878 Lime Kiln, Xiaoshadu, Shanghai West, previously built two thatched houses on a vacant lot near the residence. He moved after a short time due to insufficient space. He sold the two thatched houses to Zhou Guang-jiang from Yancheng, who paid him fifteen dollars for the building costs. However, not long after, Dong's younger brother, Bu-yun, approached Zhou demanding that the houses be returned or that Zhou pay an additional ten dollars. After repeated negotiations, Zhou refused. On the afternoon of the previous day, at 10 PM, the Dong brothers went to meet with Zhou again, urging him to move out quickly. An argument broke out, and the two sides began to fight. As a result, Bu-yun was injured in the head by Zhou and was bleeding profusely. The police were called and all were arrested and taken to the Sixth District Police Station. After an interrogation by District Chief Ren, the case, involving a dispute over the sale of a house and resulting in injuries, was documented and sent to the court for trial yesterday.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, at about 4 o'clock, two young men, one dressed in an upper-class outfit and the other dressed like a tea server, entered the Gong He Xiang silk tobacco shop outside the Xinbei Gate. The one with the upper class outfit was wearing a long blue-grey silk gown and the other was wearing a blue striped white western cloth shirt and pants. He had a letter from the Gong Tai store in Nanhui City. The letter stated, "Please immediately pay 20 packages of Jiahe (tobacco brand) and 20 packages of Gonghe (tobacco brand) and deliver them to Mr. Yang." The shop assistant realized it was a forgery, and the seals on the letter did not match the seals on the previous letter from Gong Tai. The assistant turned the two men over to the police officer on duty, who brought them to the Second Precinct of the First District of the Municipal Police Bureau. After a brief interrogation by the station chief, they were detained pending investigation.</p>

Ren and Xue confessed to helping with the move. Judge Zhu sentenced Huang to 14 days of imprisonment, Ren to 5 days, and Xue to a fine of 5 dollars as a warning.</p>

<p>News from Various Labor Unions</p>
<h3 id="e234">Federation of Water and Electricity Workers' Unions <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Water and Electricity Workers' Unions issued a declaration stating that the committee had been ordered to prepare for the establishment of the federation and was sworn in on July 26th. It was scheduled to begin operations and work on August 6th. However, during this preparatory period, it was feared that various sectors and labor unions in the industry were not fully aware of the true situation. Therefore, they briefly described the general outline to clarify their purpose. Since the Central Government promulgated the Labor Union Law, there is no longer a requirement for a general labor union. Therefore, they are organizing a federation of labor unions in various industries to test the results. If the results are excellent, then they will consider federations of labor unions in other industries. The federation was established at a time when the country is facing many difficulties and the front is working hard to kill the enemy. The rear should be tightly organized to prevent villains from jumping out and disrupting the revolutionary front. Therefore, the federation will do its best to prepare for the establishment of the municipal federation of water and electricity workers' unions in three months, in accordance with the organizational rules, in order to achieve a complete preparation. All organizations in the industry should regard the federation as a real need and the only group, and should work together in harmony to achieve success, so that the industry can be united and the unity can be expanded to prepare for common interests and seek the development of the future. The future of the party and the country and the future of the labor movement all depend on it. This declaration is made.</p>

<h3 id="e241">Zhang Wenqing Not Sentenced to Death <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Sentence Changed to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Chen Hengcai Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>Zhang Fusheng, the former magistrate of the Qing Dynasty, died many years ago. His eldest daughter, Wenqing, is now 24 years old and has not yet married. On January 25 of this year, Zhang's concubine, Ms. Su, was killed in her residence on Biande Road. After the incident, the police investigation showed that Wenqing had instigated Chen Hengcai to conspire with Gao Jintang and Yao Yonggui to commit the crime. They were taken to court and sentenced to death. Zhang and the others refused to accept the verdict and hired lawyers Wang Yintai and Wang Chuanbi to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. The appeal brief was several thousand words long, elaborating on the facts and the law. The most important points are as follows: (1) A comparison of the probative value of the police statements, the first trial testimony, and the testimony of the Second Branch. (2) The three essential elements of constituting an instigation offense. (3) Whether Zhang Wenqing had a motive to instigate the murder of her stepmother. (4) Why Chen Hengcai wanted to kill Zhang Su-shi. Yesterday morning was the date for the second trial of the case. The police brought the defendants to the First Tribunal of the Higher Court. The lawyers for all parties, Wang Yintai, Wang Chuanbi, Wang Yaotang, Jiang Rongfan, Gang Wu Zhiping, and others, were present in court. At nine o'clock, Presiding Judge Song Yuan, Judge Du Fuyue, and Chief Prosecutor Wang Zhennan arrived in succession. Judge Song read the judgment, stating that the original judgment was reversed. Chen Hengcai was sentenced to death for the crime of jointly premeditating murder. Zhang Wenqing, Yao Yonggui, and Gao Jintang were sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime of joint murder, and all were deprived of their civil rights for life. After the judgment was read, the police took the defendants out of the courtroom. At this time, Chen Hengcai not only showed no signs of sorrow, but also sang loudly. The song he sang was neither Peking opera nor Kunqu opera, but a folk song from northern Jiangsu. Those who heard it were amused. The police were satisfied with the verdict and will not appeal further. It is not yet known whether the defendants will all plead guilty or appeal to the third trial.</p>

<p>The Girl's Testimony: "Don't Say"</p>
<p>Conflicting Accounts of Origin from the Couple</p>
<p>Ten Men, Women, and Children Apprehended</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan steamer, docked at the Taikoo Wharf in the French Concession, was about to set sail at 6:00 AM yesterday morning when Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang, investigators from the Women and Children Relief Association, together with Hua Detective Jiang Changsheng and Cheng Yongnian from the Water Police, boarded the ship for inspection. In the steerage, they spotted two men (one in a Western suit) and two women</p>
<h3 id="e243">Whispering Quietly <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>accompanied by a young girl and three boys. Each of the two women was holding a baby. Finding their behavior suspicious, they were immediately interrogated. Their answers were inconsistent, so the entire group of men, women, and children was taken to the Water Police Station. After separate questioning by the police chief, one of the men, claiming to be Chen Jianwu (the one in the Western suit), 28 years old, a teacher from Changxing, said that he married a Ms. Zheng</p>

<p>named Chen A-bao (one of the three boys) as a servant. He presented a paper bag with the words "Private Seventh National School, Fourth District, Jinjiang County" attached. The police chief asked if the marriage had a matchmaker and who the officiant was. Chen replied that in today's civilized world</p>
<h3 id="e246">Freedom of Marriage <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>couples do not need matchmakers, and everything in the countryside is simple and does not require an officiant. Another man, claiming to be Hu Kewang, 34 years old, a stone mason from Changxing, said that his brother had opened a stone shop in Xiamen and had written to him asking him to go there to work. Therefore, he was traveling to Xiamen with his sister-in-law (referring to the two women) and children, and there was nothing else. One of the women, claiming to be Ms. Hu Zhang, 29 years old, from Changxing, said that she was Hu Kewang's wife. Seeing that she was</p>

<p>the police chief, in order to investigate the case, asked her quickly whether the child was a boy or a girl. Upon hearing this, the woman tried to open the diaper (i.e. the cloth diaper bag), but was stopped by the police chief. Seeing that her plan had failed, the woman hastily replied that it was a girl. As soon as she finished speaking, she</p>
<h3 id="e248">Unwrapped the Diaper <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>revealing that it was indeed a male child. The woman's face turned red and she lowered her head without a word. Another woman, also claiming to be Ms. Hu Zhang, 30 years old, from Changxing, said that she was Hu Kewang's sister-in-law and was traveling with her uncle to live with her husband in Xiamen. She was also holding a girl in her arms, breastfeeding. The young girl, upon being questioned, claimed to be surnamed Zheng, refused to give her name, was 17 years old, from Wenzhou, and that her parents were both alive. She then fell silent. The police asked her if she was Chen Jianwu's new bride. She replied with the words "Don't Say". The police were even more suspicious and asked her</p>
<h3 id="e249">What Secrets <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>she was hiding that she was unwilling to say. If she was suffering, they could find a way to help her. However, the girl still said "Don't Say". Furthermore, the three boys, one named A-bao (whom Chen Jianwu claimed to be his servant), 12 years old, from Huzhou, one named Hu Weilin, 7 years old, from Changxing, and one named Hu Weiyun, 4 years old, from Changxing, replied that they did not know to all other questions. Hu Kewang then pointed to the two Hu-surnamed children as his own sons. The police chief questioned them separately. After the investigation was completed, it was discovered that there were three obvious</p>
<h3 id="e250">Suspicious Points <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>(1) Chen Jianwu first claimed that his wife (i.e., Ms. Zheng) was from the same village (i.e., Changxing), but Ms. Zheng claimed to be from Wenzhou. (2) Ms. Zheng replied to all questions with the words "Don't Say". (3) The first Ms. Hu wrongly identified the baby boy in her arms as a girl. Other statements also contained contradictions, indicating that they were not entirely truthful. The case seemed to be a planned human trafficking operation. It was immediately decided to send all ten men, women, and children to the local court for investigation.</p>

<p>On June 14, the Shanghai Arsenal test-fired a shell at the Wusong Fortress on the northeast coast of Taiwan. A shell landed on the home of villager Chen Fenglai, destroying the house and killing Chen's mother, Ms. Ying. Unexpectedly, the Arsenal sent personnel to the seashore outside the North Gate of Baoshan to test-fire artillery shells again on the afternoon of the previous day. Chen Fenglai happened to be holding a memorial service for his mother on that day, and relatives and friends were gathered. Unexpectedly, a shell fell from the sky, landing in Chen Fenglai's home for the second time, piercing the wall. Fortunately, the shell did not explode, so no one was injured. However, Chen's relatives and others rushed out of the house in a panic.</p>

<p>The Changxing Company's newly built largest new Pacific liner, the Empress of Japan, with a displacement of 33,000 tons and a speed of 23 nautical miles per hour, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from London on the ninth of this month and berth at the Yongdong Blue Funnel Wharf. An invitation was extended to all sectors to visit the ship from 3:00 PM. This matter has been noted in this newspaper. It is now known that the ship's draft is too deep and the ship's hull is too large. The company has changed its plan. After arriving in Shanghai on the ninth, it will not berth at the Blue Funnel Wharf for the time being, but will anchor at the Wusong Estuary.

<p>Since the Hongkou Epidemic Hospital opened on July 25, patients have been coming in droves, with more than 400 cases. The results have been excellent. Director Zhu Jing'an and others, in view of the needs of the hospital, have only built ten temporary wards on the purchased site, which is insufficient and is not a long-term solution. They have decided to actively proceed. In addition to the directors and factories doing their best to solicit construction funds in order to achieve a permanent solution, they have also invited engineer Mr. Tang Weiming to design the hospital. Mr. Tang has always been interested in public welfare matters and has now agreed to volunteer his services.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Yu Qingyu Appeals Against Wu Jianguang and Others <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>Yu Qingyu previously sued the famous astrologer Wu Jianguang and others for fraud in the Shanghai Special District Court. The presiding judge Feng Shide declared the defendants not guilty in court. This has been repeatedly noted in this newspaper. It is now known that the plaintiff Yu Qingyu has hired lawyer Zhang Chongding to prepare an appeal, as the appeal period is about to expire. This shows that the rumor that the plaintiff and defendant have reached a settlement is not true. The appeal prepared by lawyer Zhang is extracted below.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Criminal Appeal <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>Appellant: Yu Qingyu</p>
<p>Appellees: Wu Jianguang, Wang Yonghai, Chai Caifa, Chai Caigao, Wang Zhenhai, et al. (ages, native places, and addresses omitted)</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of disagreeing with the first instance acquittal of the defendants and therefore legally filing an appeal: The appellant, in the first instance, brought a private prosecution against the defendants for fraud. On July 28th of this year, the appellant received the esteemed court's judgment, the main text of which reads: Wu Jianguang, Wang Yonghai, Chai Caifa, Chai Caigao, and Wang Zhenhai are all not guilty. After receiving the judgment, the appellant found it truly difficult to accept and is therefore filing an appeal within the statutory period. The reasons for disagreement are respectfully presented below:</p>
<p>(1) The greatest error in the original judgment lies in its determination that, although astrology involves superstition, there is no specific article in criminal law to punish it. However, Article 363 of the criminal law clearly stipulates that if one intends to illegally possess something and uses fraudulent means to induce another person to hand over their property, it constitutes the crime of fraud. In this case, the appellees make a living from astrology, and Wu Jianguang and others openly admit this. The stars are a phenomenon of the natural world, and the Earth is also a planet. What connection can the movements of the stars possibly have with the fate of humans on Earth? Furthermore, a person's birth year, month, day, and hour have no mathematical formula that can determine their destiny. The appellees use this baseless deception as a means of making a living. If this is not a fraudulent trick, what is it? Moreover, they use dangerous language, trying to quickly fool ignorant women into believing them. If this is not inducing people to hand over their property, what is it? Yet the judgment says that criminal law has no specific article to punish it. This is truly like what Master Zi said: "Clearly observing the tip of an autumn hair but not seeing a cartload of firewood." This is the first reason for disagreement.</p>
<p>(2) The appellee Wu Jianguang in this case engages in supernatural trickery opposite the Hongmiao Temple in Nanjing, making a din of drums every day. Passersby all know this. The appellant's lawyer, upon briefly glancing at the account books he presented, immediately discovered entries for 21 yuan, 36 yuan, 56 yuan, and 36 yuan from August 11th to 13th. It can be imagined that he habitually engages in fraud. Yet the original judgment determined that the testimony of the appellant's wife was not credible because there was no Chen Xing real person. However, it is not known how many account books Wu Jianguang, whose business is booming, may have at the same time. Criminal proceedings prioritize discovering the truth. The truth of this case has already been discovered, yet the original judgment picked up on minor details in the testimony to declare the defendant not guilty. How can this possibly be convincing? Chai Shaofa and Chai Caigao hired the blind Wang Yonghai, using the name of his deceased father, Chai Wenzhong, to open a divination hall and share the profits. A receipt written by Chai Caifa is evidence. Yet the original judgment, based on the defendants only admitting to receiving six jiao of foreign currency, declared them not guilty. However, in law, the only question is whether a crime was committed. Even if it is only a small silver coin, if the elements of the crime are present, it should be punished accordingly. Although Wang Zhenhai did not admit to knowing the scriptures and incantations, this is also just empty words of denial. The appellant has already presented evidence, but the original trial summarily dismissed it, making it difficult for the appellant to accept. This is another reason for disagreement.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, the appellant respectfully requests that the esteemed court overturn the original judgment and punish each appellee according to the provisions of Article 363 of the Criminal Law, as well as Article 364 of the same law, to demonstrate party governance and follow the trend of the times, for the sake of public convenience.</p>

<p>Jin Yousun Cannot Find His Wife</p>
<p>Has Another Argument with His Mother-in-Law</p>
<p>Jin Yousun, who works in a grain shop on Wangjia Wharf in the South Market, married into the Jin family of Nanhui as a live-in son-in-law to Jin Zhou's daughter, Jin Jin. Because he often works in Shanghai, his wife was left alone, leading to an affair with Zhang Yongmei, an assistant clerk who is a civil servant. When the affair was discovered, the Nanhui County sentenced each of the adulterous couple to three months of imprisonment. Zhang and Jin Jin did not accept the sentence and appealed to the local court, which upheld the original judgment. They were imprisoned in the Caohejing Third Prison. Yesterday, Jin arrived at the prison gate at 8:00 AM to wait for his wife to be released and take her home. Unexpectedly, two cars were already waiting in front of the prison gate. Soon after, Zhang Yongmei and Jin Jin were released together and left in the cars. At that time, Jin Zhou was also in front of the prison gate. Jin Yousun immediately stepped forward to stop them but was beaten. Helpless, he took Jin Zhou to the Third Branch of the Sixth District police station. Yesterday, she was transferred to the local court. According to Jin Zhou, "My daughter was originally a live-in bride, so of course she should return home with me. She is indeed at my home now. Jin Yousun can come to my home, but my daughter cannot go to his home. Zhang Yongmei did not go with her." After the prosecutor verified the statement, he ordered Jin Zhou to post bail pending further investigation.</p>

<p>Another Woman Dies from Severe Injuries</p>
<p>At about 1:00 AM the day before yesterday, a fire broke out at 133 Donggui Lane, Yuanfang Road, Hongkou, when a resident named Li Tianmin, a Cantonese man, was carelessly preparing opium. The fire quickly spread to the neighboring 132 and burned to death four men and women on the spot, and injured six men and women. The injured were sent to Tongren Hospital. Afterwards, firefighters found the bodies in the fire and carried them to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road, but their faces were burned beyond recognition and it was impossible to determine their identities or genders. The day before yesterday, the Special District Court dispatched Prosecutor Xu Mu to the Forensic Examination Office to confirm that the two corpses were burned to death and that no relatives had claimed the bodies. Therefore, he ordered that they be temporarily placed in the Pushan Cemetery, marked with the date of death, pending identification by relatives. That afternoon, detectives from the Hongkou Police Station found another body in Dachang and learned his name was Wang Gendi. At the same time, Tongren Hospital called the police to report that one of the injured women, Wang Wu, had succumbed to the fire's toxins and died. The police then sent her body to the Forensic Examination Office as well. Yesterday morning, the Special Court again dispatched Prosecutor Guo Huaipu to the Forensic Examination Office. Ye Kunrong arrived and claimed that Wang Wu was his maternal aunt and Wang Gendi was his cousin, and that he would claim their bodies. Mr. Guo approved this and ordered that the two bodies be handed over to Ye Kunrong for burial. The arsonist has now been prosecuted by the police.</p>

<p>Reconciliation Achieved in Court, Divorce Granted</p>
<p>He Qian, a woman from Nanjing, is 29 years old. She married He Yushan, a man from Shaoxing, in 1921. After she married into the family, her husband despised her because of her appearance. As a result, their feelings for each other faded. More recently, He had an affair and treated her like a thorn in his side. Friends and relatives had previously stepped in to mediate, providing her with living expenses of 10 yuan per month. However, this was only empty talk. Unable to endure the suffering, she hired Lawyer Jin to file a lawsuit for divorce in the local court. The lawsuit stated that she had been abused and abandoned by the defendant, He Yushan, and that he had failed to provide for her. She requested the court to grant a divorce. As the plaintiff is a weak woman, how can she live independently? Even if the defendant agreed to pay the promised amount monthly, it would be difficult to survive. Furthermore, he cut off all support, leaving her starving and freezing. In July, she argued with him about this, and the defendant, being violent, became furious and beat her, causing her to be injured and nearly die. Neighbors rescued her and she fled back to her mother's home. The next day, she reported the injuries to the prosecutor's office of the court. As the defendant avoided appearing in court, it was ordered that if the plaintiff saw the defendant, she should immediately arrest him and bring him to trial. The plaintiff was unlucky in marriage and had no choice but to divorce in order to save her life. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Zhao Zhenhai specially opened the Second Court to hear the case. The plaintiff, He Qian, testified, "I married the defendant at the age of 20. We did not have any children." (Question) "Have you always been on good terms?" (Answer) "He dislikes my appearance, so we are not on good terms." (Question) "How much can you earn doing work each month?" (Answer) "More than ten yuan." (Question) "Why do you want a divorce?" (Answer) "He doesn't support me." (Question) "Do you live together now?" (Answer) "We separated on March 28th last year. He took my belongings away, leaving me with no place to live. I found him this April, but he and his mistress beat me." (Question) "What is his mistress's name?" (Answer) "Her name is Shun Di. They injured my right eye, left arm, and lower abdomen. The prosecutor's office examined the injuries and issued a government order." The defendant, He Yushan, testified that he was 33 years old and did not want a divorce. (Question) "Do you have a mistress?" (Answer) "She is not a mistress, she is a neighbor." (Question) "What is Shun Di's last name?" (Answer) "I don't know. She has a man who works in the electrical certificate business." (Question) "Did you beat the plaintiff?" (Answer) "No, I did not." (Question) "If you didn't beat her, how did she get injured?" The defendant was speechless. Judge Zhao first attempted to reconcile the two parties. As a result, divorce was granted. Judge Zhao drafted a reconciliation record. Afterwards, the man and woman were free to marry as they pleased. Both parties signed the agreement and left the court.</p>

<p>Accusation of Two People Abducting Her</p>
<p>Zhang Yongnian, 25 years old from Changzhou, runs the Yihe Restaurant across from Daxia University on Jiaozhou Road in western Shanghai. His wife, Cao, 24, have been married for over three years. Their relationship has been harmonious. Recently, she has been spending a lot of time with a fellow villager, Tang Ni. Zhang did not think much of it. Unexpectedly, on the first of this month, Cao told her husband that she was going to visit Tang Ni's house at 538 Haifang Road in the International Settlement. She left and disappeared. Zhang checked their belongings and found that many of her clothes were gone. He was certain that she had been enticed to run away. Zhang went to the address to look for her, but Ni also avoided him. It was not until 8:00 PM the day before yesterday that he grabbed Ni. He immediately negotiated with the crowd, but Ni claimed that after his wife came to her house, she went to Wang Jinchang's place at 377 Robert Road and that she was not the one who had abducted her. Zhang then went with Ni to the address and arrested Wang. He called the police and they were both taken back to the Sixth District Police Station. After the district chief questioned them separately, the case was considered to involve the abduction of a married woman and concealing her whereabouts. Yesterday, a formal document was prepared and sent to the local court for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Appeal in Son-Killing Case Rejected <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Original Sentence Upheld for Two Women</p>
<p>Chen Zhang, a woman from Suqian, killed her son Mingjian (30 years old) because he did not work and only loved smoking and gambling. He did not support her, but instead constantly demanded money from his mother and wife, Zhu. If he did not get his way, he would become violent. Zhang discussed with her daughter-in-law, Zhu, and they agreed to strangle Mingjian to death with a rope while he was asleep at 1681 North Yinghua Lane, Robert Road, on the night of May 22nd and abandon the body in the wilderness. After the case was discovered, they were arrested and brought to the Special District Court. Chen Zhang was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and Chen Zhu was sentenced to six years of imprisonment. Chen Zhang, feeling that her son was like a tumor that needed to be removed, was not satisfied with the sentence and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. The trial has ended and yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Song and Judges Du and Ye opened the court to announce the rejection of the appeal. She was immediately taken to the women's prison to await execution after the sentence is finalized.</p>

<p>Yu Yanyu, 49 years old from Hubei, rents a house at 124 Lujiazhai, Pudong and runs a noodle shop. He has a daughter who is of age and was betrothed to Li Shengdi, a fellow villager, since she was young. They have not yet married. Li, now 23, works as an employee in a noodle shop at 7 Luban Road, Lujiawan Road in the French Concession. His wages are barely enough to make ends meet, and he is too poor to marry and start a family. Recently, he was suspended from his job by the shop owner for something and had nowhere to go. He had no choice but to cross the river to his father-in-law's place the day before yesterday afternoon and ask him to take him in. He was willing to temporarily work as a shop assistant to find a place to stay. Unexpectedly, as soon as Yu heard Li's words, his face turned cold and he firmly refused to acknowledge him as his son-in-law. The two sides then clashed, and Li destroyed some of Yu's shop's items. The police from the Fourth Squad of the Police Department arrived and took Yu and Li to the Third District Police Station. Yu stated that although his daughter was promised to Li as a wife when she was young, they had not gone through the engagement ceremony. He now saw that Li could barely support himself, let alone support a wife, so he denied that Li was his son-in-law. Li stated that there was indeed a matchmaker proving that Yu had betrothed his daughter to him as his wife. He now sees that I am poor and intends to break the engagement and asked for help. The district chief verified the statements and, as the case involved a marriage dispute, he was unable to handle it and ordered both parties to file a lawsuit in court.</p>

<p>Plaintiff Detained in Police Station for Investigation</p>
<p>Zhang Jinfa, from Jiangbei, reported to the Fourth Branch of the Fifth District police station the day before yesterday that Zhang Wanchang and his mother, Zhang Gu, who live at 303 Huade Road in the concession, enticed his sister, Zhao Zhang, to a deserted area near Gaolang Bridge in the Chinese area in June 1925 and killed her. The district sent detectives to Gengshu Pu Police Station to assist in detaining Zhang Wanchang and Zhang Gu. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that the allegations reported by Zhang Jinfa were unfounded. The police found that the two defendants have always been law-abiding. Later, Shi Lantian, a detective from the Public Security Bureau, complained that a murder did occur at the end of June of that year. The body was examined by the local court, and no relatives came to claim it. Therefore, an official letter was submitted for inspection. Furthermore, the plaintiff, Zhang Jinfa, complained that the deceased, Zhao Zhang, was my sister. She married a man named Cao from Zhenjiang. Her brother-in-law died in September 1924. The defendant, Zhang Gu, came to Shanghai with her from Zhenjiang. Afterwards, there was no news of her. Therefore, when she was killed, I did not know about it. It was not until recently that a certain person living with the defendant told me about it that I knew about it. Therefore, I reported it to the bureau. When questioned, the defendant Zhang Wanchang stated that he was a painter in Hong Kong at the time and knew nothing about the accusations. Zhang Gu also denied the allegations and claimed that she was being falsely accused. Furthermore, the police lawyer claimed that many of the things reported by the plaintiff at the police station were inaccurate and requested the court to order the plaintiff to be temporarily detained at the police station for a detailed investigation. If it is a false accusation, the police will file a public prosecution. It was also heard that the plaintiff had made similar false reports to the Public Security Bureau. After Judge Feng Shide verified the statements, he ordered that the two reports be returned separately for investigation by the local court and the case file of Zhang Gu's suspected murder. Zhang Jinfa was temporarily detained in the police station pending investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Opening of Guo Ju'an's Appeal Case <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>A Major Debate on the Issue of Legal Persons Arises</p>
<p>The American-owned Chase Bank previously sued Guo Ju'an in the former Provisional Court for failing to perform his guarantee debt of over 64,000 taels. The court ruled against the defendant. Guo, dissatisfied, filed an appeal with the Sino-Foreign Civil Appeal Office attached to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Until the end of last year, the Ministry ordered the abolition of the Appeal Office, and the Appeal Office was eliminated along with it. However, the case had not yet been tried. The case files of this appeal were initially preserved by the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Recently, the judicial authorities decided that all unresolved appeal cases would be handled by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Guo's appeal case was heard yesterday by Presiding Judge Hu and Judges Li and Ye. The appellant's lawyer first raised the issue of legal persons and requested that it be resolved first. The reason was roughly that Chase Bank had not registered with the Chinese government and had not obtained legal person status, so it should not have the capacity to litigate. This argument was similar to the one made by lawyer Zhang Rongxi in the case of Mitsui &amp; Co. suing He Gengxing and others. However, the lawyer for the appellee, Chase Bank, seemed to have anticipated this issue and used the name of Chase's manager in the response. However, the appellant's lawyer then stated that its main body was incorrect. The first instance was signed by Chase, and the second instance cannot be changed at will. Therefore, the two lawyers debated each other from morning to noon without addressing the merits of the case. The court stated that the point of contention regarding legal persons raised by the appellant did not require much debate because the appellee had already changed to using a natural person's name. However, as it was time to adjourn, it was ordered that the case be rescheduled for another hearing.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Candle Industry Guild submitted a request to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Regarding the matter of membership dues being overdue and not paid, please examine and instruct us to follow your guidance. The membership dues of Sanhecheng Candle Store (at the intersection of Tangshan Road and Zhaofeng Road) have not been paid since last winter. Although we have sent people to advise them four times, they have not paid. The assistant manager of the store, Xu Jingfu, recently insulted the collector and his mother. Furthermore, the membership dues of Yuanfengrun Candle Store (in the Eastern Xinqiao of the British Concession) have also been repeatedly delayed and not paid. We have checked the fee standards of the guild, which were previously decided by the general meeting and approved by your Chamber. All members should pay quarterly and not make excuses, so that the guild's expenses will not be exhausted and the guild's affairs can be properly organized. The guild leaders are acting so recklessly and illegally, directly destroying the guild's membership and indirectly disregarding your Chamber's orders. If this trend is not immediately corrected, and others follow suit, what fees can the guild collect and what affairs can it handle? Should your Chamber send someone to supervise the guild staff to advise them, or should it be resolved legally by the Chamber sending a letter to the court to provide proof?

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>In the suicide news of Hao Futian in your newspaper yesterday, there was a statement that "the general manager of the [Blank] Raisin Company published an advertisement to recruit managers. Mr. [Blank] Ti Fang collected 1,000 yuan to apply for the job. Unexpectedly, a few days later, [Blank] absconded with the money due to debt." After investigation, our company's general manager has never absconded. No other employee has absconded due to debt. Furthermore, we have never heard of a [Blank] Ti Fang. He must not be an employee of our company. Therefore, we are writing to request a correction to be published in a prominent position in your newspaper.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>[Blank] [Blank]</p>
<p>General Manager of American Raisin Company</p>

<h3 id="e275">Ministry of Education Revises <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>Regulations on the Organization of Primary and Secondary Schools and County Education Bureaus in Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>Primary School Principals Manage School Administration Under the Direction of the Department Head and Middle School Principals</p>
<p>Students Expelled from Middle School May Be Given Certificates Permitting Transfer to Another School</p>
<p>The Words "Provisional" Should Be Added to the Regulations on the Organization of Education Bureaus in Each County</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education recently promulgated the regulations on the appointment, dismissal, and treatment of principals of provincial primary and secondary schools, the provisional regulations on the organization of primary and secondary schools, and the regulations on the organization of education bureaus in each county. The Jiangsu Provincial Government sent a request to the Ministry of Education to review and register the regulations. Yesterday, the Ministry of Education replied to the Provincial Government with three points of revision to the original regulations. The three points of revision are excerpted below:</p>
<p>After reviewing the "Regulations on the Appointment, Dismissal, and Treatment of Principals of Provincial Secondary Schools in Jiangsu Province" and the "Provisional Regulations on the Appointment, Dismissal, and Treatment of Principals of County Primary Schools in Jiangsu Province," there are no discrepancies and they may be registered. The remaining regulations should be revised in accordance with the following points: (1) The "Provisional Regulations on the Appointment, Dismissal, and Treatment of Principals of Provincial Secondary School Experimental Primary Schools in Jiangsu Province" and the "Provisional Regulations on the Organization of Provincial Secondary School Experimental Primary Schools in Jiangsu Province" are both prefixed with the words "Provincial Secondary School." Furthermore, Article 13 of the "Provisional Regulations on the Organization of Provincial Secondary Schools in Jiangsu Province" stipulates the establishment of experimental primary schools, indicating that experimental primary schools are part of the organization of provincial secondary schools. However, Article 13 of the "Provisional Regulations on the Organization of Provincial Secondary Schools in Jiangsu Province" stipulates that the principal of the experimental primary school reports to the principal of the secondary school, while Article 2 of the "Provisional Regulations on the Organization of Provincial Secondary School Experimental Primary Schools in Jiangsu Province" stipulates that "the principal of the experimental primary school reports to the head of the Department of Education." The provisions seem to be inconsistent, and the regulations on the relationship between the experimental primary school and the provincial secondary school also seem to be slightly unclear. The Ministry proposes the following revisions: In the "Provisional Regulations on the Appointment, Dismissal, and Treatment of Principals of Provincial Secondary School Experimental Primary Schools in Jiangsu Province," delete Articles 1 and 2. Article 1 pertains to organization and can be included in the "Provisional Regulations on the Organization of Principals of Provincial Secondary School Experimental Primary Schools in Jiangsu Province." Article 2 pertains to the duties of the principal and can be stipulated in the "Detailed Rules for the Service of Principals of Experimental Primary Schools." Both are unrelated to appointment, dismissal, and treatment. (2) Add an item to Article 3 of the "Provisional Regulations on the Organization of Provincial Secondary Schools in Jiangsu Province": "Each middle school teacher training department shall establish an experimental primary school to provide students with practical training and experimental primary school education. Its organizational regulations will be formulated separately." In Article 13, do not add the five words "Head of the Department of Education and" to "reports to." (3) Change the "Provisional Regulations on the Organization of Provincial Secondary School Experimental Primary Schools in Jiangsu Province" to the first article of the "Provisional Regulations on the Appointment, Dismissal, and Treatment of Principals of Provincial Secondary School Experimental Primary Schools in Jiangsu Province" as Article 1 of these regulations. Sequentially change the numbers of the articles after the original Article 1. Change the original Article 3 to "Article 4: The experimental primary school shall have one principal who manages school administration under the direction of the Head of the Department of Education and the principal of this middle school." (2) Students who are expelled from school are generally deficient in conduct, academic performance, or physical education. If they are all prohibited from applying to transfer to another school, then these students will never have the opportunity to enroll and further their studies, which seems unsatisfactory. In Article 17 of the "Provisional Regulations on Admission, Transfer, Withdrawal, Suspension, and Continuation of Studies in County Secondary Schools in Jiangsu Province," delete the original Article 18 and renumber Articles 18 to 23 as Articles 17 to 22. The first item of Article 22 (i.e., the original Article 23) must be changed to the fifth item. The original items 2, 3, 4, and 5 are changed to items 1, 2, 3, and 4. After Article 22 (i.e., the original Article 23), add an article as Article 23, which reads: "Students who are expelled due to the circumstances of the preceding articles may be given a transcript and certificate of completion by the original school, except for those whose circumstances are serious due to the circumstances of the first item (i.e., the original second item)." Also, in Article 24, change the words "Article 21" and "Article 23" to "Article 20" and "Article 22." (3) In the "Regulations on the Organization of Education Bureaus in Each County of Jiangsu Province," add the words "Provisional" under the words "Regulations." The above is approved for reference. It is requested that these review opinions be examined and that a response be provided. This is sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Government.</p>

<h3 id="e283">China-France University Has Been Approved for Record Filing <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>The China-France University was initiated by people from both countries and subsidized by the governments of both countries. It was previously registered with the Ministry of Education of the Beijing government. After the establishment of the Nanjing National Government, there were some revisions to the university system. The regulations of the China-France University, which has branches at home and abroad, have all been considered and revised to ensure that they comply with the new university system, which is not as simple as that of ordinary universities, so more time is needed. During this period, the China-France University resubmitted the already registered and revised regulations for record filing with the Nanjing Education Department, which has been approved. Its treatment is completely the same as that of private universities that have been registered. In addition, the Pharmacy Specialization Department of the university has been open for just over a year, and the results have been remarkable. During the summer vacation this year, the original site at 300 Avenue Albert was greatly expanded, and many new professors were hired. A large number of various pharmaceuticals and chemical instruments were purchased from Germany. The department was jointly submitted by China-France University to the National Government Education Department for record filing and has been approved.</p>

<h3 id="e292">Shanghai Lawn Tennis Association Cancels Inter-Bank Cup <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>Chinese and Western Tennis Circles Reconcile</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Association's refusal to allow Chinese players to join the Inter-Bank Doubles competition in this session has led to a split in opinions between Chinese and foreign tennis players. The donor of the cup clearly stated that it was for the competition of foreigners in foreign firms. It has been more than twenty years since then. Last year, the association did not object to the Chinese players joining the competition. This year, it was too late to restrict them from joining based on this provision. How could the Chinese players endure this unfairness? This is the cause of the disagreement. In short, the occurrence of this matter should be attributed to the improper handling procedures of the association's directors. The president of the association, in view of this, once invited Hu Xiansheng, chairman of the Chinese Tennis Association, and Zhou Jiaqi, secretary, for an informal conversation last week. Both parties clearly explained that they agreed that only by canceling this cup can this unfortunate event be salvaged.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the association held a committee meeting at the residence of the acting president, McHeel. At the same time, Hu Xiansheng, chairman of the Chinese Tennis Association, and Zhou Jiaqi, secretary, were invited to attend the meeting. After many discussions, it was publicly decided to formally cancel the Inter-Bank Cup to show that sports are open to all. The resolution of yesterday's meeting is recorded below: "The Inter-Bank Cup competition does not meet the purpose of open sports due to the limited conditions of the donor's nature. Therefore, it is resolved to cancel the cup and temporarily suspend this competition. A suitable competition should be created to replace it in the future."</p>

<p>Woman—Darling, I don't know why you are sometimes very brave, really like a true man, but sometimes you are so cowardly, like a woman.</p>
<p>Man—I'm afraid it's hereditary, because my ancestors were half male and half female.</p>
<p>Mother—Child, tomorrow is your tenth birthday. You can tell me what you like most, and I will definitely do it for you.</p>
<p>Child—I like to see the school burn down the most, so I won't be scolded by the teacher anymore.</p>
<p>Brother—Why don't you do serious things and just smoke cigarettes all day long?</p>
<p>Brother—I only have these times to smoke cigarettes, because I have to sleep all night until dawn.</p>
<p>Judge—Criminal, have you been to prison before?</p>

<h3 id="e294">Chen Duomin's Record of Resistance Against Thieves <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— Robbery</p>
<p>According to a news report, a robbery occurred at the Huade Watch Store on Nanjing Road on the first of this month. The details were not clear. Because the manager of the store, Mr. Chen Duomin, is my classmate, I know more details about it, so I specially record it. The thieves, who spoke with a northern accent, were dressed in blue and white, pretending to be customers selecting gold watches. Mr. Chen Duomin cordially received them. Unexpectedly, while Mr. Chen was discussing the price with the man in white, the man in blue suddenly passed him a pistol. The transfer happened to be seen by an apprentice, so the thief bumped his jaw with his elbow. The apprentice was frightened and did not inform the store, but slipped out the back door with the intention of reporting to the police. The thief in white took the gun in his hand and openly loaded the bullets. When Mr. Chen saw this, he realized that they were thieves. Just as he was about to turn around, the thief pointed the gun at Mr. Chen's waist and threatened him not to make a sound. At the same time, the thief in blue snatched another customer's money. At this time, the shop assistants and customers were all terrified. Mr. Chen silently thought that if he let them do what they wanted, the store would suffer a major loss. He couldn't help but feel righteous indignation and disregarded everything. He quickly twisted his waist to dodge the muzzle and grabbed the thief's hand, turning the muzzle towards the thief himself. As a result, the thief in white had no way to use his skills. When the thief in blue saw that his accomplice was in trouble, he rushed to help, but the pistol had already been seized by Mr. Chen. Seeing that the situation was not good, the thief in white escaped first. Some of the shop assistants chased and shouted after him. The thief turned around and ran into the alley behind the store. Coincidentally, the apprentice of the store, who had been hit by the thief, was wandering at the entrance of the alley. When he suddenly saw the thief flying towards him, he recklessly bumped his chest with his head. The thief was taken by surprise by this sudden blow, was horrified, turned around and ran wildly to the side of Women's Bank Road, and was first captured by the apprentice. The thief in blue could not seize the gun and was no match for Mr. Chen. Seeing that his accomplice had escaped, he also ran away. Mr. Chen immediately followed with the gun and shouted for capture, and was captured by the Indian police. Looking at the capture of these two thieves this time, not only was Mr. Chen selfless, brave and decisive, but the whole store's personnel's rush to justice was also commendable. At a time when theft cases are emerging one after another, there are very few people like Mr. Chen who dare to confront thieves. Mr. Chen's bravery is enough to inject a shot in the arm for the demoralized habit. Although Mr. Chen did not have real kung fu, how could he dare to fight with his life if he had no backhand? Therefore, it is not a small contribution to the promotion of Tai Chi by the master.</p>
<h3 id="e295">A Remembrance of the Late Famous Doctor Zhou Fenbo <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Daosheng</p>
<p>I remember four years ago, my father suddenly suffered from abdominal pain. It did not subside for several days. I asked many famous Chinese and Western doctors for diagnosis and treatment, but it was ineffective. I was extremely anxious. My relative, Chen Zhancheng, strongly recommended Dr. Zhou Fenbo, saying that his medical skills were excellent, and volunteered to invite him. In a short time, he came with the doctor to diagnose the illness. He described the symptoms as if he had seen them with his own eyes. The pain stopped with one dose and was completely cured with three doses. After that, whenever the old and young in my family suffered from any illness, they would seek his advice, and all were effective. Unfortunately, God did not bless people, and he suddenly returned to the mountains, which cannot but make people sigh. Fortunately, his two sons, Litang and Taihe, have been well-trained, diligently studied and practiced, and have more than enough knowledge and experience to serve the world. Their reputation is no less than that of their father. Zhu Yingpeng, a member of the Supervisory Committee of the Municipal Party Department of this city, suffered from insomnia this year. I introduced him to Dr. Litang, and he was completely cured with two doses. He exclaimed that it was a magical skill. Therefore, I believe more and more that family learning has a source and that fame and virtue must have successors.</p>
<p>Dr. Zhou Fenbo was originally from Wuxi and lived at No. 1 Xindeli, Nanma Road, South Wharf, Shanghai. He was always upright and had been practicing medicine for more than forty years. His prescriptions and treatments were based on the theories of Zhang Zhongjing and supplemented by the Thousand Gold Prescriptions. Therefore, his clinical diagnoses were accurate and often had miraculous effects. In recent years, he has been overworked and his qi and blood have been weakened. He often asked his two sons to diagnose instead, while he was watching by the side. This spring, I heard that he was ill and took time to visit him. I still saw that his mind was clear. He said that he had no serious illness, but that his qi and blood were weakened and he was afraid that he would not last long, but he was not afraid of death. He said that his eldest son, Litang, could continue my way, and his second son, Taihe, also had a foundation in acupuncture and throat science. If he could gain more experience, he could also serve the world. Unexpectedly, he passed away in early March. It is said that he had no remaining assets behind him, but only left ten kinds of preparations for throat problems, such as the Banzhen Pill for the Upper Moon, the Diphtheria Pill, the Infant Convulsion Powder, the Purple Gold Pill for Trauma, the Cholera Relief Pill, and special medicines for various blood conditions, such as the Chong Ren Hemorrhoid Removal Pill, the Breast Carbuncle Worry-Free Pill, the Typhoid Cinnamon Fragrance Powder, and the Miraculous Jaundice Pill. The first six types have been launched and are selling well for a while. The other four types are also being researched and will soon be available to the world. Dr. Zhou had been practicing medicine for many years and always wanted to make medicines to help patients, so he had no savings. On his deathbed, he repeatedly instructed his sons not to seek profit and to offer the legacy medicines at a fair price and provide half-price assistance to those in need to continue production and carry on his will. Dr. Zhou's uprightness, self-cultivation, and righteous methods of teaching his sons are exemplary.</p>
<h3 id="e296">Proven Remedy for Dysentery <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Shuping</p>
<p>During this intense summer heat, one careless act of eating can easily lead to dysentery, a condition of extreme danger. I recently read in a Western newspaper about a proven remedy. Although I have not tried it myself and cannot vouch for its effectiveness, I am confident it will not cause harm. Therefore, I am translating it here for your consideration.</p>
<p>The method involves tearing large sheets of clean, white, thick paper into small pieces and boiling them in milk for several minutes until the paper dissolves. Add a small amount of rock sugar. Take it three or four times a day. It is said that a certain doctor has been using this for thirty years with repeated remarkable effects, especially convenient and easy to implement during military campaigns. It is speculated that the dissolved white paper pulp may have the ability to moisturize and cleanse the intestines and stomach.</p>
<h3 id="e297">After Reading the "Zhonghua Tu Hua Za Zhi" (China Pictorial Magazine) <a href="#e297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Er</p>
<p>Recently, the "Zhonghua Tu Hua Za Zhi" (China Pictorial Magazine), published by the Dongfang Publishing House, which is newly establishing a flag to promote Eastern culture, has released its inaugural issue. I originally do not understand art, but from the perspective of appreciation, after reading it several times, I found it very interesting and rich in content. Therefore, I will briefly describe its contents separately as follows:</p>
<p>This issue contains more than ten articles. (1) Mr. Yan Duhuo's "The Effect of Painting" is divided into three points: first, obvious; second, beautiful; and third, rich in stimulation, using simple language to explain the profound principles of the effect of painting. (2) Mr. Zhou Shoujuan's "Spring in Xuedou Mountain" is the longest and most interesting travelogue in this issue, vividly depicting the scenery, allowing the reader's mind to evoke many illusions and serene feelings of layered emerald peaks, flying waterfalls, bright breeze and clear moon, and sudden rain clouds. (3) Ms. Gao Zi's "General Evaluation of Women's Track and Field at the National Games" fully elaborates on the past advantages and disadvantages of women's track and field at the National Games and future remedies. Other articles include Mr. Wang Dafo's "A Word for the Ninth Far Eastern Games," General Chiang Kai-shek's "Ci An Ji," Zhou Shoujuan's translation of "The True Man," which can serve as an inscription for general young people, Lin Nanpeng's "A Brief Account of the Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory," which supplements public knowledge, Wu Yunmeng's "Men Are...," and Zhu Kuan's "Odds and Ends." Most of these short articles are accompanied by photographs, making them easy to understand. The textual aspect can be described as artistic.</p>
<p>All the pictures are full of beauty, such as Mr. Hu Boxiang's cover painting, which depicts eleven beautiful women wearing peach-red cheongsams with floral patterns, smiling and holding a small civet cat, as if嬌滴滴 (jiāodīdi, charmingly) really saying "I love little civet cat." Mr. Hu Bozhou's "Fearless Spirit" seems to portray the revolutionary masses, with the left hand supporting the party emblem and the right hand holding an iron awl, actively showing the spirit that under the blue sky and white sun, the party should be the premise and force should be the backing. In total, there are sixty or seventy photographs. In addition to current affairs photos such as "Gandhi Resisting England" and the collection of the National and Far Eastern Games and the National Boy Scout General Inspection and National Walking Group, artistic photography such as Mr. Guo Xiqi's "Consolation," Mr. Lang Jingshan's "Setting Sun," and Mr. Zhu Shouren's "Rest" are all artistic. In particular, photographs such as "Chiang Kai-shek's Hometown," "Spring in Xuedou Mountain," "Shanghai Observatory," "Construction of the People in Sichuan," and "Overseas New Inventions" are particularly valuable.</p>
<p>Statement: Recently, we received a letter from Mr. Tang Kaizhi of Qinghua Middle School, stating that the two drafts of Laonu, "Su Dongpo Smoking Opium," published in this publication on August 1st, have already appeared in a certain publication on the 3rd, which is obviously a case of submitting one draft to two publications. Therefore, the remuneration will be cancelled. This is hereby declared.</p>

<p>— Qian Hua</p>
<p>(10) (9) Night Market in Ginza</p>
<p>The entire Tokyo Prefecture has an area of 1,389.06 square miles and a population of 4,485,144. It has two cities, one county, and eleven towns, sixty-eight villages, and one hundred and fourteen. Tokyo City is one of the two cities, with an area of 526.7 square miles and a population of 1,995,567. It is divided into fifteen districts, including the 神田 (Kanda) District, 日本橋 (Nihonbashi) District, 京橋 (Kyobashi) District, 芝 (Shiba) District, 麻布 (Azabu) District, 赤阪 (Akasaka) District, 四谷 (Yotsuya) District, 牛込 (Ushigome) District, 小石川 (Koishikawa) District, 本郷 (Hongo) District, 下谷 (Shitaya) District, 浅草 (Asakusa) District, 本所 (Honjo) District, and 深川 (Fukagawa) District. The 日本橋 (Nihonbashi) and 京橋 (Kyobashi) districts are the bustling centers, where all the banks, large companies, and corporations are gathered. There are a total of 140 banks in Tokyo City, with a total capital of 913,554,400 yen. There are 5,340 companies, with a total capital of 4,426,219,117 yen. There are 6,704 factories, with 182,205 employees. There are 646 elementary schools, with 544,312 students. In the 京橋 (Kyobashi) district, the 銀座 (Ginza) street is the most lively. The road is wide, the buildings are neat, and the multi-storied buildings are tall, similar in style to the Sassoon House in Shanghai. All the houses are uniform, without the disadvantage of unevenness. This is because the Tokyo City Hall has an overall plan for the construction of buildings. At night, the lights shine, the pedestrians are like weaving, and the vehicles are connected and driven in an orderly manner. The police maintain traffic very diligently. The speed of cars is regulated in the bustling city, with a maximum speed of 15 miles per hour. Pedestrians cross the street without any danger. News of cars injuring people is also rare. The 銀座 (Ginza) street is similar to Nanjing Road in Shanghai because of the night market, which makes it doubly lively. The Japanese value entertainment, and they always engage in various forms of recreation in their leisure time. Gambling is strictly prohibited in the country, but the 美人座 (Bijinza) dance hall, geisha houses, and mahjong clubs are very popular. As the saying goes, "If you don't gamble, you indulge in wine and women." The most noble ones take their wives and children to stroll through the night market, watching movies and dramas. The night market is open from 7 pm to 10 pm. Along both sides of the road, stalls are set up, and all kinds of goods and meals are available. The size of the stalls varies, depending on the amount of tax paid. Each stall is managed by only one person, with bamboo poles as frames and cloth awnings. Three or four colored paper lanterns are hung in front, which are strange and dazzling. From a distance, it looks like ten thousand golden snakes, which adds to the prosperity. Walking among them, examining each stall, there are clothing, antiques, calligraphy and paintings, copper and bamboo carvings, utensils, small electrical appliances, and various old goods, etc., as if entering a department store, dazzling the eyes. The Japanese production is extremely ingenious, and various Japanese mechanical products are particularly ingenious, and the price is also low, about 30-40% cheaper than those purchased in stores during the day. Therefore, the business can be maintained permanently and become a special occupation. The night market stall owners are all small-capital brokers, with only tens or hundreds of yuan of capital, which is enough to support the whole family. Half of the goods are wholesale and half are made by themselves. If they can be ingenious and invent small items, household items, or children's toys, they can occupy a superior position in the night market and earn double the profits. There are night markets in all districts, but the scale is not large. Ginza is the most prosperous, followed by Asakusa, and then Kanda, and the main products sold are different. The Ginza night market has the most clothing and silk fabrics, Asakusa has children's toys, and Kanda has more photos and books. In all the places where Japanese forces are expanding, such as Dalian and Liaoning, there are night markets, but the scale is smaller. There is also a night market outside Qianmen in Beiping, but the candlelight on the stalls is like beans, and the street lights are dim. The night market has become a black market, and the goods sold are cheap and of poor quality. Taking advantage of the darkness, unscrupulous merchants often use counterfeit goods to confuse the real ones. Customers buy them by mistake because they are greedy for cheapness, and when they see them in the light the next day, they are not worth a penny. Under the disappointment, they are annoyed. It has the name of a night market, but it is actually a black market. The Japanese night market has absolutely no fraud. The merchant's ethics are really incomparable.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Episode 13: Who Plants Good Fortune Unintentionally Obtains a Diamond Ring? Only This Predestined Relationship Can Sing of the Golden Tower with Intention</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Zuo Shichen smiled and said that according to your statement, I might as well not buy your tickets. Shi Guanping asked why. Zuo Shichen said that I am just an outsider who doesn't understand calligraphy, paintings, or antiques. Even if I win the lottery and get a valuable item, I would be unworthy of this rare treasure. Shi Guanping said that's not how it is. For example, if there is an exquisite painting, it is naturally best to belong to someone who can paint well and who can also write well. That way, both parties benefit. The person who paints becomes even more skilled, as the so-called "spirit is hidden in the brush and ink, and the brush and ink become spirit," and the painting also meets a soulmate, so there is no woman throwing pearls into darkness. However, even if someone cannot paint, as long as they are an appreciator, they can know the interest of the painting. After storing this painting, they can occasionally open it and play with it, as if they are in it. The colors of the trees are scattered, the mountain path is tortuous, and the thatched cottage and woodcutter's path are clear valleys and secluded streams. The scenery is not even an inch, but they can travel their eyes endlessly. At that time, although they cannot paint, the painting can be considered a soulmate for them. Otherwise, they know it is an exquisite item but can protect it carefully to wait for someone with knowledge to appreciate it, so that it will not fall into the hands of vulgar people. That can also be considered good. You know that there are now some unbearably vulgar people who don't know where they got a few stinky copper coins and want to be pretentious and buy calligraphy and paintings and ancient books to decorate their homes. In fact, they know nothing. As the so-called "full of copper stench without a single bone of elegance," if some good things fall into the hands of these people, it is really a disaster, like a beautiful woman marrying a violent, evil, and vulgar slave, which is enough to make people cry out loud. They already have such a thing, which is an undeserved blessing, but they still want to make the treasure suffer. Sometimes they inscribe a postscript that is stinky and unbearable, ruining the clean white paper. Sometimes they make a strange-shaped seal, claiming to be an appraiser of antiquity, stamping a seal in the east and stamping a seal in the west, just like putting feces on the head of a Buddha. Moreover, they stamp the seals in the vital areas, directly trying to change the fate of this antique of yours. Even if there is a good doctor, they can never cure it. Do you think this is hateful? Therefore, you blame the collectors for often keeping their precious items secret and not showing them to others, as if they are very stingy. You don't know that there are still those kinds of bad guests who fail to accomplish anything but ruin everything. Not only do they not know how to cherish them, but they also recklessly destroy them. If you are careless and lend it to them to see, they will repay you with such a prank. When you see it and shout "Oh dear," it is too late. They want to write a postscript and stamp a seal, so their name will be spread through the ancient objects, but they don't know that the treasure has suffered that disaster, that eternal disaster. Therefore, I now vow to use collotype printing to print the original ancient objects precisely, so that the original can still be treasured and the printed copy can be as good as the original and can be used for people to appreciate. Isn't that good?</p>

<p>The Gold Market Lingers, Resulting in a Slight Increase</p>
<h3 id="e300">The Market Seems Fleeting <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market situation on the 6th was still stable. The morning was weak and the afternoon was strong, and the market had ups and downs. The market totaled about nine taels, but the elusive nature of the market made it difficult to grasp. In the end, it rose slightly. The foreign exchange was stable. A few banks were taking in and out. As for the fellow traders, their minds were drifting and they did not care. They came and went, such as Hengxing, Yuanxing, and Yongxing, all of which bought in. Yuansheng, Yuanmao, and Yong were in the lead. From the early market's large strip, it opened lower, and the actual strength was still strong. Later, it fell to 72 taels, but then buyers swarmed and suddenly broke through the 80 tael mark, rising seven or eight taels. Afterwards, Hengxing, Yuanmao, Yongfeng, Yong and other offers were diverging. Moreover, the Indian exchange rate rose and fell suddenly. Only the foreign exchange market was worth 80 taels. People's hearts were distraught. In the end, it was calculated at 79 taels. As of yesterday, the London silver market had increased by one-sixteenth and the US silver market by one-quarter.</p>
<h3 id="e301">Morning Turns from Weak to Strong <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>The September gold price initially fell by one tael, initially opening at 576 taels, 1 mace. The exchange rate was 7-8 qian. Looking back from 76 taels to 6 li 6-7 qian, but Fuchang, Yuansheng, etc. were very interested and immediately fell more than four taels to about 9:30 a.m. to 72 taels 2-3 qian and the foreign exchange rate was flat. The current English gold bank traded at 6 pence 625 and Dalian Erjing ate 1 tael 2 qian 0125. Then, after seeing the low price, it added 1 tael to 73 taels 6-7 qian. When the price was not changed, it fell by 3-4 qian. Only Hengxing purchased it, and Huabi ate October English gold at 6 pence 8125, so it increased to 74 taels 6 qian. After a while, it lost 2 taels, but speculators sold it and did not forget. After 10 o'clock, it was 72 taels 7-8 qian. After entering, Anda and Magalli bought October English gold at 6 pence 75, so the market turned sharp and rose sharply. However, Hengxing, Yuanxing, Yongfuchang, and other sales were scattered and bought, and the exchange rate was also firm. September US gold, Zhongri and other banks traded at 37 yuan 9175 to 8125. Therefore, the gold recently formed a knot with a discount of 6 pence and a half, resulting in the gold price suddenly rushing out of the 80 tael mark. After 11:30 a.m., it reached 80 taels, 05 qian, and then it seemed to be frustrated with an estimated 1 tael up and down. At noon, the scarf was collected at 79 taels, 6 qian.</p>
<h3 id="e302">The Afternoon Scarf Turns High <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 79 taels 8 qian, followed by 80 taels 0 qian. Hengxing, etc. sold it, retreating to 79 taels 1 qian. As a result, the Indian exchange rate was reported to be reduced to 80 taels 05 qian at 2:30. In a flash, the sellers were active and it was heard that the Indian exchange rate had returned, so it fell by 2 taels. After 3 o'clock, it fell to 77 taels 6-7 qian. Afterwards, Hengxing, Yuanmao, Yongyuan, Xingyong, etc. all had to chase and buy, causing it to be pulled up more than 3 taels. At about 4 o'clock, it reached 81 taels. Afterwards, there were many sellers in the field, and those who had entered before took advantage of this high price to sell it immediately. The empty side had suppressed it slightly, so it leaked 2 taels. Afterwards, it was 78 taels 8 qian. At 4:30 p.m., the market closed at 79 taels. In short, the market seemed to be a swirling situation, and it was 1 tael, 9 qian higher than the day before.</p>

<p>The Market is Stable and the Transactions are Smooth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC posted foreign exchange remained unchanged. The large strips grew slightly, but it did not move. However, the internal British, American, and Japanese exchanges seemed to be tightening. Initially, it was flat. Then, because the gold price turned high, it also tended to rise. However, the market was stable and there was no change. Moreover, there was no market on Wednesday afternoon. The Chinese traders' transactions were smooth. Only a few intakes were made. Banks such as Huabi, Maixing, and Anda took in and occasionally took out. Moreover, various lines exchanged tens of thousands of pounds. In addition, US gold, Zhongri, and other lines exchanged 200,000 yuan. As for the Japanese gold, Dalian sold it slightly. Mitsui entered it, but hedgers were rarely seen. At noon, compared with the 5th, the English gold shrank by 0625, the US gold shrank by 125, and the Japanese exchange rate rose by 25. People's hearts were slightly better.</p>

<p>At the end of the summer, the major trade of various industries could not be developed in time. In addition, the relationship between the gold and silver prices this time caused the import of goods to almost stop. It is appropriate that the market is inferior and the supply of the financial world has no heavy possibility. The only thing that can stand a place in the current market is the embellishment of other items. Therefore, the trading situation and the approximate in and out are almost without the momentum of today's years.</p>
<h3 id="e311">Small Margin Prices <a href="#e311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>
<p>(Foreign Margin) In the early market, people's hearts were slightly better and the margin price turned 3 hao and 7 suddenly. Half was 7 qian 2 points and 9 li. The noon market was weak again by 1 hao and 2 suddenly, half was 7 qian 2 points and 8 li 8 hao and 7 suddenly. As a result, the early market on the previous day was only 1 hao and 2 suddenly and the Yuan coin plus water still had more than 1 li. The Zhongshan new coin plus water was 375 and half a li (Silver Margin) The silver margin price in the morning and noon markets was 3 points, which was slightly higher than the previous day. The loose and rampant situation of the head was still the same. Therefore, there was still no market price for the head and the listing price.</p>

<h3 id="e314">News of the Sale of Old Silver Subsidiary Coins <a href="#e314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the market price of silver subsidiary coins has been rising, which has attracted the attention of outsiders. However, judging from its sales, it is very small. The situation has the value of in-depth research. After detailed interviews by the reporter, I learned that this time the silver corner is complex and has various types. The old coins printed with the words (Guangdong Province Made) are commonly used in foreign ports. The market price is not only more expensive than the market price, but also adds water. As for the ordinary miscellaneous coins with lower quality that cannot be exported, they are still the same. The old corners of 8 and 4 are now rising more sharply, from 6 qian 2 points 89 li to 6 qian 4 points 2 li, and even 6 qian 4 points 8 li. The old corners with clear patterns on both the Yin and Yang sides have the highest price, and foreign ports also require shares. Others, such as the one-sided smooth version and the one-sided version with the words (Guangdong Province Made), have no way out. The most urgent need now is the Tianjin gang. The current price of cloth in the port is only 10.0 points per ocean in Shanghai, while the Shanghai market is 11.24 points. Therefore, general cash sellers are happy to transport it. Therefore, it is expected that the old corner will be extinct in Shanghai in the future.</p>

<p>Customs Duties, Reorganization of Soldiers, and Post-Disaster are Rising Sharply</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public debt futures market was more active than before. The total transaction volume was more than 7.5 million yuan. The reorganization and transfer accounted for 3.445 million yuan, the customs duties accounted for about 2 million, the reorganization of soldiers accounted for more than 1.5 million yuan, and the post-disaster also accounted for more than 1 million yuan. However, the other debts were still not strong. There was no transaction in the 7th year and finance. Moreover, the spot market was very clear. Only 1,000 yuan of the reorganization and dismissal small tickets were opened in the afternoon. As of yesterday, the trend of each debt was that the situation was slightly better and people's hearts were slightly more at ease. Therefore, the investment and purchase by all parties was not lonely. Each debt price rose sharply when it opened in the early morning. Although the subsequent trend was harmonious, it was still quite strong. As a result, compared with the previous day, the reorganization and transfer futures rose by about 1 yuan and 8 angles, which was the largest. The customs duties, the reorganization of soldiers, the post-disaster continuation 25 and other futures also rose by more than 1 yuan. However, the 96 futures were slightly weaker than the initial price of the week.</p>

<p>The trend of the yarn market is still strong. The spot yarn needs to be smooth and the Guangdong gang is still eager to collect. Therefore, people's hearts are firm and the buying power is stronger. The Japanese second-grade yarn has a large number of exports in the north and the market price has become active. However, the political situation in India is still strong and there is a part of the cloud. The price of the second-grade yarn may not have a sustained rise in the future. However, most of the psychological autumn sales of the native yarn still have a large number of rising hopes, and the intention to do more is extremely dense. However, the business of ten and twenty native yarns is bleak.</p>

<p>Yesterday, about ten boats arrived at the harbor. High-quality rice sold well in this area, while the price of average or substandard rice declined slightly. Fresh Be粳 rice was priced at around 21 yuan. The price of ordinary old rice trended downwards due to lack of demand. Large transactions were slightly reduced. Overall, rice prices fluctuated. It would be difficult to see further increase. Because the manufacturers of Dongxin粳 are inconsistent, the price increased again by half a yuan, reaching 21 yuan. The supply of Bo rice in the market is getting tighter. The price is firm and tight, with high quality rice opening at 19 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e325">Hu Nan <a href="#e325" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c325" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">325</a></h3>
<p>Boats arriving are still few and sales are not good. High-quality Changxi rice remained firm due to continued price increases, but Sutong Bai rice saw weak demand and prices fell by around 0.2 yuan per unit. Warehouses of northern and southern manufacturers have sold off more than half of their inventory. Most stores are currently taking a wait-and-see approach. Current prices are still trending upward. Secondary grades of rice are moving faster. The supply of early-harvested Bo rice in Nanhui has dried up and transactions are slow, and therefore the price of rice is trending upward. Top grade rice opened at around 18 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, demand for foreign rice was weaker and more merchants are hoping for permission to ship large quantities to the north. However, in the two or three days since the ban was lifted, less than 2,000 bales have been transacted, including goods stored from before, totaling no more than 10,000 bales. Although there were reports that the Ministry of Finance would issue a second ban, Tianjin did not react. Northeast buyers did not purchase large quantities. This is because northern grain merchants have already directly purchased a large number of goods from foreign countries. These purchases are cheaper than those from Shanghai. Merchants despaired. A small portion of the merchandise was devalued in an attempt to sell, decreasing by three to four cents. The selling price opened at: No. 1 Saigon: 1,000 bags, priced at 17 yuan to 16.67 yuan; No. 2: 200 bags, priced at 14.25 yuan; Small Woven: 1,500 bags, priced at 15.8 to 15.5 yuan; Big Woven: 500 bags, priced at 12.56 yuan; Min Dang: 1,000 bags, priced at 15.4 to 15 yuan; small woven rough rice: 1,000 bags, priced at 11.6 to 11.2 yuan.</p>

<p>The difference between high and low prices reached four cents. Shipping north remains restricted.</p>
<p>The wheat flour market yesterday experienced extremely large fluctuations, with the price difference being rare in recent months. When the market opened in the morning, the price of foreign wheat was good, with prices for the near term (eight or nine cents) and further out (one or two yuan) doing equally well. Market players were active, prices for the current month to October were raised by 2.57 cents. Prices for November and December were raised to 2.5675 cents, and the price for January rose to 2.5725 cents, all increasing by about four cents compared to the previous day. From the second round forward, prices declined as large factories and short sellers gradually offered resistance. Price fluctuations reached two cents. In the afternoon, it was difficult to export goods to the north, as the ban included Yantai and Qinhuangdao. Prices declined because of the ban. The price for September and October fell below the price from the previous day. This was due to speculators. The price for August and November/December did not change. The price of September/October decreased by a small amount and the price for January decreased by a smaller amount.</p>
<h3 id="e328">Wheat Futures Rise and Fall <a href="#e328" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c328" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">328</a></h3>
<p>Spot prices are high, one cent</p>
<p>Wheat futures opened higher in the morning due to higher quotes for imported wheat. The price for the current month increased to 5.0, and the price for September increased to 5.04, seven to eight points higher than the previous day. Prices in other months rose as well. As long positions pulled back, the market fell slightly. In the afternoon, prices were weak after news that flour also could not be exported. The same ban applied to ports in the north. The wheat flour market fell. As a result, the market fell. The price for August and September rose by one point compared to the previous day, October declined by one point and November to January increased by one point.

<p>High inventories, stagnant sales in Europe and Japan</p>
<p>Excessive rainfall and fluctuating temperatures during the spring silkworm season in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year have led to a sharp increase in the production of dual cocoon silkworm cocoons. European and Japanese sales have been weak. Old stock has not been cleared. New, domestic, dual cocoon silk is continuously shipped to Shanghai. Inventories are high. The market price is low. High quality, single-cocoon double silk cocoons opened at 60 taels. A few sales were made.</p>

<p>Yesterday, tea merchants in Luzhuang, Zhenmei and other places were active in the tea market. The market was not idle. However, prices were still low.

<p>Yesterday, the sources in Nantou Road were scarce, and the outlets in urban and rural areas were mediocre. The demand from the Bianyuan distilleries was still strong, so the price of the thin rice was slightly raised by 0.03, and the thick rice was even scarcer, and the price remained unchanged.</p>

<h3 id="e358">European Birth Control and Promotion of Reproduction <a href="#e358" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c358" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">358</a></h3>
<p>— Fulan</p>
<p>Recently, the birth rates in various European countries have declined shockingly compared to pre-World War I levels. However, generally speaking, the number of births still exceeds the number of deaths, so government leaders in various countries are not yet overly concerned. Italy is unique in seeing an increase in its birth rate, which is a success of Mussolini's policies over the years to encourage reproduction and use other persuasive methods to attract more small citizens.</p>
<p>The reasons for changes in birth rates, for most European countries, are nothing more than encountering any of the following situations, or even both:</p>
<p>(1) The country's economic situation is too impoverished to allow the state to spend much money encouraging reproduction.</p>
<p>(2) The country's dense population and unemployment problems have already forced thousands of citizens to emigrate, so government offices have had to urgently and continuously implement methods to increase the population.</p>
<p>Central Europe</p>
<p>The countries of Central Europe are generally affected by both of the above situations, especially Hungary. This is because after the war, large-scale land surveys harmed 700,000 farmers, who then lived off their savings. Coupled with the decline of agriculture, this resulted in an increase of 200,000 unemployed farmers.</p>
<p>Social scientists believe that one hope lies in concentrating efforts on reducing infant mortality rates, the effectiveness of which is very predictable. Reliable statistics reveal that England and Russia are currently working hard on this movement. In Britain, the infant mortality rate was 148 per 1,000 in 1896, but by 1929, it had decreased to 74 per 1,000. Similarly, in Russia, it was 265 per 1,000 in 1913, but by 1928, it had also decreased to 155 per 1,000.</p>
<p>In Germany, the birth rate was 35.8 per 1,000 in 1901, but last year it was only 17.8 per 1,000, a decrease of more than half. According to Professor Grotjahn, a famous social scientist at the University of Berlin, he is preparing to suggest to a committee that it investigate the actual situation and begin insurance for child education and child health. However, Germany's current economic situation makes it impossible to spend millions of marks to handle this matter.</p>
<p>The attitudes of various European countries toward the concept of birth control vary. For example, Britain is one of the largest and strongest countries. Since 1919, the introduction of any birth control methods has been prohibited in all obstetrical schools and welfare clinics. On the other hand, abortion is legal in Russia. In that country, every effort is made to introduce all birth control methods.</p>
<p>A separate overview of the birth rate situation in various countries is as follows:</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>Unmarried men must pay 10 percent of their income in income tax. For married men without children, it is reduced to 9 percent. For married men with one child, it is reduced to 8 percent. In 1929, the number of births exceeded the number of deaths by 350,000. In 1907, the average couple had four children, but in 1929, it was only 1.97.</p>
<p>The current population of Germany is 60 million. Experts predict that if the current situation continues, it will definitely decrease to 46 million by 1975.</p>
<p>England</p>
<p>Currently, there are 4,131 people engaged in midwifery and welfare work in England. The infant mortality rate has been greatly reduced due to improvements in hygiene, the popularization of education, and various conveniences. Although the government does not provide bonuses, mothers can receive ten dollars from the National Health Insurance Bureau for giving birth to a child. The amounts mentioned in this article are all in US dollars for the sake of uniformity. If her husband is also insured, she can receive another ten dollars. If the father dies, the mother can receive 2.5 dollars per week for her own alimony. In addition, she receives 1.2 dollars per week for the first child and 75 cents per week for each subsequent child until they reach the age of fourteen. In 1913, the number of births in England was 881,138, but last year it was only 644,218. As in Germany, government officials claim that, given the current economic situation, it is difficult to allocate 350,000,000 dollars from the state to subsidize families, as suggested by all the Labor Party and Trade Union Congress.</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>In the first three months of this year, the number of births in France exceeded the number of deaths by 10,797. Advances in hospitals have reduced infant mortality. The government does not give bonuses to mothers, but they enjoy preferential travel expenses. If a father has 14 or 15 strong children, he often receives a very honorable commendation. In addition, the Cognac prize, with the first prize as high as 25,000 francs, is still awarded to the largest and most valuable family in the country.</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>Noble women linger in tea parties and banquets, while women in shacks talk about how to care for infants. Mussolini cannot escape blame for this. He was alarmed by the drop in the birth rate, believing that it was a sign of national decline. Therefore, three years ago, he hurriedly encouraged reproduction in order to increase the number of young Italian citizens. He used various incentives. Based on the birth rate in the first six months of this year, the national population will reach 43 million by 1931. In other words, it will increase by 650,000 in one year, an increase of 30 percent compared to the pre-war average birth rate of 500,000 per year. When Mussolini's first decree was issued in 1927, the funds he used to improve children's welfare and midwifery came entirely from taxes on unmarried men. In addition, he exhausted all kinds of methods to prevent birth control. All propaganda of this kind is not allowed. Pharmacies may not prepare birth control prescriptions without a doctor's order. He often withheld funds for local public works improvements, instructing officials to start work as soon as the population increased.</p>
<p>Russia</p>
<p>Soviet Russia has the highest mortality rate in Europe. In 1928, there were 42 births per 1,000 people and 18.1 deaths per 1,000 people. As a result, the population still naturally increased by 3.5 million. In state schools, trade union members are educated about birth control free of charge. Once a woman proves that she is pregnant, a government-established committee can order a legal abortion. However, this situation leads to many illegal actions. In addition to the government's efforts to promote birth control, it seems to be desperately encouraging the success of large families. Working-class mothers have two months of full leave before and after childbirth without deducting wages. Many large factories have set up nurses and nannies to take care of children while their mothers are working. According to the current population growth situation, Russia will have 300 million people by 1960.</p>
<p>Hungary</p>
<p>Although Hungary now has a larger population than it can support, many people still feel the decline in the birth rate and are eager to encourage reproduction. The government prepares excellent hospitals and sanatoriums for mothers, providing them with free milk and medical assistance to ensure that the birth of children does not burden families with any expenses.</p>
<p>Poland</p>
<p>The continuous population increase in this country is indeed a heavy burden. In the five years before World War I, Poland was one of the countries with the highest birth rate in Europe, second only to Russia and the countries of Central Europe. Currently, the birth rate is 34 per 1,000, and the number of marriages is decreasing year by year.</p>
<p>Belgium</p>
<p>The birth rate in Belgium is falling rapidly, and the decline has not stopped. In 1880, it was 31.1 per 10,000, but by 1927 it had fallen by 41 percent. Currently, an organization has been established where fathers can borrow money without interest. Many educational institutions have government subsidies so that children have the opportunity to receive education. Government employees with families have their travel expenses reduced or their wages slightly increased. All these efforts are nothing more than encouraging the increase of small citizens.</p>
<p>Spain</p>
<p>This country rarely takes action to encourage reproduction. The former dictator, Primo de Rivera, once approved a small amount of assistance to be given to helpless families with eight or more children, but this was only limited to relieving poverty. Because it is a Catholic country, any form of birth control and propaganda is strictly prohibited. Its birth rate was 35.7 per 1,000 in 1887, but by 1928 it was only 29.6 per 1,000.</p>
<p>Portugal</p>
<p>The infant mortality rate is very high, and the punishment for implementing birth control is quite severe. Its number of births is equal to the number of deaths and immigrants. In 1918, it was 34.6 per 1,000, and in 1928 it was 31.</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>The population is overpopulated, and birth control is unknown. In 1926, there were 344,000 births and 219,149 deaths. The government provides free medical assistance for those who implement fertility treatment, while it is considering drafting a law to punish those who implement birth control. The contradictions of measures are like this.</p>
<p>Austria</p>
<p>The number of births exceeds the number of deaths. Although it does not encourage birth control, the government does not prohibit it either. Birth control devices are sold everywhere. In Vienna alone, there are 200 nursing homes that send representatives to the homes of reproducing mothers at any time to observe whether they are receiving appropriate medical care. In addition, there is a social insurance payment given to mothers as soon as her baby is born, and a basket of baby clothes is given as a gift. If the mother has to work during the day, the kindergarten also has very detailed regulations for the care of children. When children reach the age of six, they can play and escape the summer heat in healthy farms that are half-subsidized by the government.</p>
<p>Scandinavian Countries</p>
<p>The countries on this peninsula pay little attention to birth rates. In Sweden, it fell from 23.1 per 1,000 in 1913 to 16 in 1928. Denmark fell from 25.6 to 19.6. Finland fell from 27.1 to 23.2. Norway fell from 24.9 to 17.7.</p>

<h3 id="e363">Wilderness Weekly Renovation Issue <a href="#e363" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c363" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">363</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Ding</p>
<p>Published by the Wilderness Society</p>
<p>I have a fondness for small publications, especially those with a literary focus. Wilderness Weekly is of course one of my favorite reads because its content is definitely not "tabloidized" like most of the current publications circulating in society, at least in terms of writing. From my objective perspective, the past Wilderness lacked a consistent theme because the thoughts of the various authors were not unified. Each author stood on their own ground and expressed themselves. Although we didn't find it monotonous, it gave us a confusing and strange impression in terms of thought and failed to show the entire center of Wilderness. This was really his only defect in the past. The first volume of Wilderness can be said to be his germination period. The content generally could not get rid of immaturity and superficiality, but this is a necessary phenomenon when general magazines are first created. Wilderness in the early stage was of course unavoidable. The second volume of Wilderness can be said to be his growth period. The content gradually seemed to fill up like the body of a young adult. This is obviously the result of the efforts of the journal's editors and society members to have such achievements, which cannot be regarded as success. However, it can be said to be unique among small publications. The recently published Wilderness Renovation Issue (i.e., Volume 3, Issue 1) has actually progressed from the growth period to the prosperity period. After reading it, I immediately felt that the content has been completely renewed. Taking nationalist literature and art as the central idea of the journal, there is an invisible unity in the writing, which leaves a deep image in our minds, which is a world apart from the previous two volumes. Now I'll take some free time to introduce this issue of Wilderness.</p>
<p>"The Expression and Imagination of National Literature and Art" This thesis was written by Tang Zengyang. As far as I know, the author has done a lot for the past Wilderness, and at the same time, he has a considerable success in poetics. The author first determined the central idea of ​​literature and art at the opening of the article, and made a brief examination of the long-term growth of national consciousness literature and art in ancient China. Readers can understand the history of folk thoughts in the national process. Secondly, the "expression" method and "imagination" elements of national literature and art are described systematically, and it is discussed that "imagination" is by no means "fantasy" Fancy. There is also a concrete explanation of this.</p>
<p>"The Last Strike" This creation was written by Wang Tiehua. People who have read Wilderness can mostly know that he is the editor of the journal. His creative novels are actually superior to other types. This is a general observation of Wilderness readers, at least I feel it myself. "The Last Strike" is divided into five paragraphs, with the tumultuous Sino-Russian incident as the background of the article. It can also be said that historical facts are used as the facts. The author used all his energy to express the personality and intense patriotism of the important protagonist Zhao Lianchang in this article, prompting his only fourteen-year-old son to also do his best for the country. When he knew that his illness was difficult to cure, he still said to his son passionately: "You, Ying, you must remember my words. You are not too young at the age of fourteen. If I die, I cannot arrange your future. In short, you must not forget my death and the wounds of my country. You must use your strength to rush. Even if you become a road worker in the future, you must transport bullets to the front to kill the bandits..." From this, it can be seen that his love for the country is more intense than his love for his son. In terms of technique, the author has achieved great success. In the first paragraph, when Zhao Lianchang was angry with his son, he described a broken table in the room with two bottles, which made a mutual striking sound due to the vibration of the bed. The last strike was to write about the situation of Russian soldiers harassing the town. When the Russian soldiers rushed up the small building triumphantly, only small bottles were shaking on the broken table. Finally, the author pointed out that "a pile of glass bottle fragments were found downstairs" implying that this was Zhao Lianchang struggling to use the strength of his death to pick up the small bottles and make the "last strike" at the Russian soldiers who were committing atrocities in order to express his patriotic and brave heart. This is really the technique of creation, and the author's expression is also superior to other creations that write "ordinary stories". It is a great joy to be able to read such a powerful novel with nationalism as the center on a small Wilderness. In terms of structure, the article seems to be hasty. This shows that the author may have initially prepared to write a long or medium-length creation. Now that it has been reduced to a short story, it is not impossible. On the contrary, the whole article feels compact. But I hope that the author can develop the article into a powerful long story based on true facts so that the people of the country can know how the Soviet Russia, which claims to support the weak, is acting violently and illegally in China, awakening the national consciousness of the people of the country.</p>
<p>Such as the literary news and other things, it is possible to deeply imprint the whole literary news and inside information of China and the actions and tendencies of various writers in this very short news, and make a brief report with an objective perspective, and most of the things published are indeed reliable. This is really worthy of praise.</p>
<p>In short, in this Wilderness Renovation Issue, authors have all obtained the central idea in terms of thought and objectivity, and the writing has gradually created unity, so that readers who love the journal also get correct instructions invisibly and become a must-read literary publication for young people. According to reporters, the future direction of the company is worthy of attention by those who care about Wilderness. The two sections are now excerpted below as the end of the introduction of this article.</p>
<p>In terms of content, we will strive to enrich it in the future. Both the submissions from society members and external submissions will be strictly selected. If there is no good manuscript worth reading, we would rather leave a lot of blank space in this journal, and at the same time, we will never cater to the low-level tastes of readers. In terms of form, we have also tried our best to change the so-called "tabloidization" from this issue, because our Wilderness plans to make a considerable contribution to young people who are studying literature and art and not to be a kind of pastime for "idle" friends after tea and wine. Therefore, we are willing to keep the sales of Wilderness at its level or even reduce it.</p>
<p>In terms of writing, it is extremely important to make it have a consistent unity and determine the central idea, which is of course the central idea of ​​nationalism. We will not be polite to reject deformed and pathological literature and art. If there is someone who can stand on the same front and work together to promote national literature and art, we hope that he can join hands with Wilderness, otherwise, we hope that he will go his own way. The future Wilderness will not allow the so-called speculative, fence-sitting, divergent, etc. factors without a central consciousness.</p>

<p>After the Purple Opera Troupe decided to tour Xiamen in the 19th year, after more than a month of preparation, they left Shanghai on July 17 and arrived in Xiamen. After a short rest, they met with local people on stage. The plays performed were Ibsen's A Doll's House, Chekhov's The Boor, Maeda Kawakoichiro's The Death of Rasputin, Marinetti's Let's Go!, and Shao Wei's The Unknown Son. The five plays were performed in three days and four scenes and were well received by local people.

<p>The Shanghai Commercial Office of Shaoxing Huaxing Cement Mine Preparation Office was established yesterday. The initiators are Xie Yiou, Lu Wen'an, Liu Daofang, Wang Shipeng, and more than a dozen others. The mine is located in Lougong, 20 miles away from Pianmen in Shaoxing. The mineral deposits reach more than 3,000 acres. The chemical test results show that it is pure white cement. The mining machinery and construction of a light railway for transporting goods require 3 million shares. The overseas Chinese investment is being actively discussed, and leading figures of the National Government are being sought to join the sponsorship. The Preparation Office issued a declaration yesterday, recording that the most important thing for starting a business is to invest in mining, and the key to utilizing and promoting life lies in the opening of production enterprises. The wealth of agriculture and mines in our country is surpassed by various countries. The great powers are watching closely and pinning their hopes on the abundance of mineral deposits in our country. Tracing back to the decline of production, the decline of industry and commerce, the withering of the economy, and the spread of vagrants in our country, which is a major disaster for society. The root cause is that the people of the country do not engage in the promotion of production enterprises, and the national economy and people's livelihood are both weak and in trouble. It is worrying. The social state of our country has always attached importance to industrial and commercial enterprises, and there are very few facilities for agricultural and mining plans. Even if one or two initiators feel that it is difficult to gather strong investments, they give up eating because of choking, which is always regrettable. Now, overseas Chinese are concerned about the people's livelihood construction of the motherland, organizing industrial groups and returning to the country to inspect the state of industry, investing in mining and promoting profitable enterprises. Recently, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government convened a national industrial and commercial conference to encourage industrial and commercial policies, promote the development of production enterprises, increase foreign trade, and increase the national economy. Colleagues and others have personally met at this time, and they have not hesitated to initiate the Shaoxing Huaxing Cement Factory Co., Ltd., which is run by Zhejiang merchants, and set up a general preparation office in Shanghai to start preparations. Its mine is located in Lougong, 20 miles away from Pianmen in Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, named Lion Mountain. The mountain's cliffs are dangerous and connected like a snake. The total area of the mountain reaches more than 3,000 acres. The base of the mountain belongs to the Huizao Head Village in the territory. The villagers gather to take stone scraps and earth to burn and manufacture lime, which is white and strong, and is supplied to the entire Zhejiang for the needs of the architectural engineering. It is regarded as the top product. The general public in the village relies on this for their livelihood. They have been working hard for many years, generation after generation, like the foolish old man moving mountains. Since the opening of mining in the sixteenth year of Qianlong, it has been going on for more than 200 years, only cutting off one corner of the mountain end. The substance of 15% of its entire area has a long history. Colleagues and others have repeatedly invited well-known mining experts from various countries to test the results separately. The mineral quality is pure white cement, and the test results show that the output rate can be supplied to the construction of the world on a large scale. It can be called a giant mine. It is planned to raise 3 million shares to start the business. The purpose of the colleagues is to open up production, develop industrial and commercial enterprises, promote the realization of the policy of economic assistance and the people's livelihood and doctrine, and contribute to the society. It is hoped that the leading figures of our party and country, social leaders, industrial and commercial experts, and industrial leaders will participate in and assist in the success of the country and benefit the people.</p>

All Chinese and Western restaurants in this city have the sanitary pepper powder produced by the company for the use of diners.</p>
