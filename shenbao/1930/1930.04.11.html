<h3 id="c8">英國海外貿易發展會 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>美國提倡建築。以救濟失業工人。日本减縮工資。以救濟紗業之不振。英國設立海外貿易發展會。以减少失業工人。據此以觀。世界商業之衰頽。可以證明也。蓋商業衰頽。而後貨物供過於求。貸物過供於求。而後减少製造。而後乃有失業工人。又以商業衰頽。而後貨物停滯。或貨價賤售。於是工廠不能得利。或得利甚徵。而後不得已而有節約政策。减縮其工資。故美日英之各種舉動。皆商業衰落之景象也。</p>
<p>商人之貿易。有盈必有虧。有興盛之時。亦必有衰落之時。故商業而衰頽。經商者所預料。惟時之衰頽。固爲經商者意中之事。而此次商業之衰頽。關於世界之全部。非一時所能恢復。故以商戰著名之美日英三國。有見及此。不能不作長時之補救。决不認爲暫時衰落而稍待之也。</p>
<p>世人有言。盛極必衰。自工業國强盛而後。所謂商戰者。幾高出於各種戰策之上。今雖百足之虫死而未殭而全世界之商業。衰象已呈。所謂工業國之强盛者。其氣亦將稍戢乎。</p>

<p>國民政府昨訓令行政院云、案據財政工商二部會呈稱、爲懇予通令全國、制止各地任意增加税捐、以維財政而護工商事、</p>
<p>竊維實現民生主義之要旨首重發展國内工商、整理國家財政之要圖、先貴統一收支手續、中央爲整理財政、維護民生、前於十七年十一月二十日經鈞府通令畫分國家地方收入、明定釐金及一切類似釐金之通過税、統屬中央、並嚴禁地方不得附加、又於本年一月十七日、復經鈞府明令、自十月十日起、所有全國釐金及類金之一切税捐一律裁撤、良以釐定徵收辦法、俾財政得有整理之可能、免除苛雜税捐、於工商方有發展之希望、工商旣裕、</p>
<p>税源乃旺、財用不匱、政務自理、國計民生實均利賴、乃自十七后以麩、雖有通令、而各地尙未遵行、任意附加、所在多有、</p>
<p>其名目之苛細、關卡之繁多、使工商阨於卡索留難之中、財政處於淆亂紛歧之狀、</p>
<p>此而不亟予撤除、其何能實現中央理財阜民諸政策、職部等分掌工商財政、自應仰體中央意旨、於解除工商艱苦整理財政之企圖、切實遵辦、前據各省縣市商會商民工廠等呈請免除苛捐雜税、以解困阨者、如旅滬川晋帮夏布同業聯合會呈、</p>
<p>以毎件本値三十七元上下之麻布、由四川榮昌至重慶、爲程僅三百里、而所納之捐税、除正税外、其苛捐雜税竟逹十五次之多、若郵亭舖護商印花税九分、津永瀘護商捐二角七分五釐、津永瀘團費七分五釐、大安塲印花税一角、馬方橋山防捐一角、小馬方橋山防捐二角四分、來鳳驛護商印花捐八分、渝北護商捐一角二分五釐、渝北江防捐一角二分五釐、渝北分收捐八分一釐二毫五、渝北印花捐一角、</p>
<p>重慶統捐三角、重慶統捐附加一角二分、</p>
<p>重慶護商捐七分二釐五毫、重慶商團捐二分四釐、全計逹一元九角有餘、一入宜昌、又加堤工捐二角八分九釐、合之前數共爲二元一角九分六厘有餘、如加應完正税、依本以計其税率、逹百分之八九、</p>
<p>此尙僅由榮昌逹宜昌、即已如此繁重、又准北平特别市政府轉據丹華火柴公司呈稱、查機製仿造洋貸統税單、起自前清末葉、載明正税之後、概免重徵、民國肇興、</p>
<p>相沿未改、視爲惠工第一要策、近年以來、各省各地各自爲政、統税單效力盡失、</p>
<p>十八年夏間、本市工廠聯合會、曾呈請財政部咨飭維持統税成案、奉到部批、已分别咨令、務遵定章辦理、而各省各地之重徵、依然如昨、本廠專製火柴、即就火柴一項言之、毎小件二千四百小匣、凈重不及三十五斤、高次平均製本不及六元、其運往綏遠者、除統税外、到北平西直門車站收糧貨統捐一角、到張家口收大右捐三角六分四厘、勦匪捐二角二分、歸綏貨捐三角七分八厘、塞北入口出口税各四分四厘八毫、到綏遠收清源局捐七分五厘七毫、共計重徵一元二角二分七厘三毫、其運往河南者、除統税外、到北平西便門車站收河北捐一角、到石家莊收統税二角七分五厘五毫、共計重徵三角七分五厘五毫、各地之落地小費、以及隨運費徵收之軍事捐附加費站務費等、尙不在內、妨碍工業、妨碍民生、妨碍政令、旣深且鉅、伏乞鈞府據情轉請中央、迅予嚴切維護統税成案、期得實惠等情、咨請查核辦理、職部等細核該公司所稱完納各税、如合統税以計其税率、則運往綏遠者竟逹百分之二十二三、運往河南者亦逹百分之八九、此外經職部等調查所得、如由江西景德鎭運磁來京、一担之磁、爲値不過三十元、除在景德鎭完納正税一元外、近又附加二角、而沿途所經、如湖口華陽蕪湖大勝關及三叉河各處、均須加納捐税、約共一元二三角在奇、若合正税及其附加以計其税率、亦逹百分之八九、</p>
<p>綜合上列各則以　、内地各省科税之重、</p>
<p>實無倫比、其他各工廠商家雖各因銷售市塲不同、厘税繁重、數目亦異、然執一例百、當可以概其餘、此無怪國内工商難期振興、財政難期統一、究其致此之由、</p>
<p>則各地未能遵率政令、任意附加、實居其尤、職部等爲實現中央理財阜民諸政策起見、用敢會呈鈞府、懇予根據本年一月十七日裁撤厘金明令、推廣德意、通令全國、依照中央定案、一切貸物税收業經畫師國有、無論中央已徵耒徵、各該省市自不得任意收税、及增加附捐、以重民困、</p>
<p>在尙未實行裁厘期間、其應如何禁止地方自設關卡、限制附捐、取銷違背部章之苛細税捐之處、並懇飭令各省市政府暨各主管廳妥擬辦法、呈復核奪飭遵、以</p>
<p>免流弊而期實施、除另文會呈行政院、懇予鑒核通令遵辦外、理合備文呈請鈞府鑒核、仰乞俯准施行等情　此、應准照辦、除指令外、合行令仰該院即便通飭遵照辦理具報爲要、</p>

<p>廣州通信、華洋輪船、在我國口岸或内地行駛、向歸海關理船廳辦理、實於我國主權、工商航業、以及國防經濟、均有損失、</p>
<p>建設廳長鄧彥華日前特向省府提議、請轉呈國府、將現有之理船廳根本撤銷、由廳酌設港務局或理船局、暫行管理、或將航政局歸併、以一事權、業經省府第六十次會議、議决照辦、茲錄鄧氏原提案如下、一查華洋輪船、在我國口岸或内地行駛、各歸海關理船廳管理、各口岸所設浮標燈塔望台等、亦須由領事官會同地方官建築、以致主權操自外人、國體因而喪失、工商航業槪受束縛、國防經濟亦受影響、種種不利、通人類能言之、况事關内政、外人豈能越俎、故青島上海兩處業已籌備收回、吾粤爲革命策源、豈容安之若素、敢抒管見、再詳述之、一收回之理由、</p>
<p>查海關理船廳之設、發端於光緖十年、</p>
<p>實現於光緒二十四年、當時各省尙無航政機關、總税務司赫德謂華洋小輪行駛日繁、亟應頒行内港專章、以資管理、以此進言於清庭、清帝昏弱、遽可其請、遂相沿以迄於今、今者情異勢殊、已非昔比、航政局卡分設殆遍、若不將理船廳撤銷、則航政事權不能統一、此宜收回管理者一也、夫以我國物業、我國船舶或洋</p>
<p>船、而在我國地方行駛、我國不能管理、</p>
<p>職權被奪於人、爲世界各國所無、不平孰甚、現當取銷不平等條約積極進行中、苟放棄理船廳而不顧、將何以保主權崇國體、此宜收回管理者二也、又查港灣水道、關係國防、凡獨立國家對於所屬各</p>
<p>地、均嚴禁外人測繪攝影、聽其自由、置國防於何地、此宜收回管理者三也、理船廳乃洋員執政、意懹畛域、對於華輪則多方留難、對於洋輪則瞻徇情面、華商感業華輪之困難、樂業洋輪之平易、於是毎將華輪變作洋輪、歲納鈔於外國者、不知凡幾、經濟已受侵略、况洋輪日多、華輪日少、航業衰落、工商業均無由振興、此宜收回管理者四也、海關之被外人管理、因與賠欵債務有關、而理船廳管理船舶、則無關於賠欵、實與海關有别、撤銷甚易、</p>
<p>此宜收回者五也、查通商口岸、應設浮標燈塔望樓等、雖見於咸豊八年中英條約、</p>
<p>即爲理船廳管理航海標識之始、而此外被侵職權、無論何種條約、均未有明文規定、實由於總税務司逐漸侵越把持所至、</p>
<p>至華洋輪船行駛内港專章、雖經清庭批准、事屬内政、詎不能由中央命令取銷之、此應收回管理者六也、總觀上述六項理由、足見收回航權自行管理之刻不容緩、現查上海靑島兩處、均經將原日理船廳撤銷、改設港務局辦理、粤省爲南中國海通商總匯要區、尤應援例照辦、茲擬由鈞府轉呈國民政府、將現存之理船廳根本撤銷、一面由職廳酌量情形、設置港務局或理船局、暫行管理、或將航政局歸併、以一事權、是否有當、統祈公决」、（四月三日）</p>

<p>南昌通信、贛省之贛浙·贛粤·贛皖（景湖</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>段）三路、省府建設廳原定今年三月底完成、嗣因匪共俶擾、籌欵困難、故公路處劉處長、特將各路進行情形、呈報建廳、</p>
<p>請予派兵剿匪、俾得從事建築、并懇准予展期完成、聞張廳長特令其展至六月底、</p>
<p>一律竣工、以利交通、關於三路建築之近况、大致如下、</p>
<p>贛粤路、該路漳樹至新淦間、及吉安境内一叚路基、正在加緊修築中、適鄰縣峽江境内發生匪警、新淦危急、築路工人、相率逃歸、嗣于上年十二月匪勢稍殺、</p>
<p>再行復工時、又値氣候寒冷、雨雪交加、</p>
<p>路工進行、極形遲緩、至峽江吉水間、則以頻年匪共包圍、十室九空、稍有家資者、無不遷居異地、以避匪患、籌欵派工、兩感困難、益以該縣路綫最長、匪禍最厲、</p>
<p>而應籌路基　欵、最佔多數、計佔十二萬元之鉅、官廳命令、不出縣門、即數千元亦難籌得、大有無米爲炊之慨、</p>
<p>贛皖路、該路之在景湖路浮梁境内者、已成百分之九十二、鄱陽地方人士、以路綫距城過遠、籌欵派工、非常消極、都昌境内土工費亦如數籌集、小木橋及涵洞水管費、亦在籌措中、祇以地方不靖雨雪過多、遂至延緩、湖口地瘠民貧、路欵只籌到半數、且去年九月、皖匪竄踞路綫、因之民工不敢到路工作、工程歸于停頓　　贛浙路、該路除南昌進賢東鄉三縣已次第興工、餘干餘江臨川鉛山玉山等鄕不日興工外、其餘上饒弋陽貴溪三縣、俱因匪風甚熾、籌欵派工、不克進行、甚至籌定之路欵、亦多挪作剿匪之用、職是之故、除對於路工進行、未敢稍懈外、並將各線土方玉程、極力增加、以冀早日完成</p>

<p>青島通信、膠東自高桂滋部在諸城發生變動、駐防各地軍隊紛紛調往圍剿、防務空虚、各地流氓遂趁此機會、勾結土匪、大肆架掠、茲將各縣匪患情形、探誌如下、</p>
<p>膠縣、膠縣因連年供給駐軍給養、虧欠公欵數萬元、特設公益局、以資整理、</p>
<p>該局自成立後、於地丁錢糧之内加收軍事善後捐一項、毎銀一兩、附征至三元之鉅、查膠縣共征地丁銀約四萬八千兩、</p>
<p>此項善後捐可征銀十四萬四千元、刻下追迫甚急、人民不堪其苦、加以駐軍他調、土匪猖獗、殺人放火、日有所聞、大小股匪約十餘股、著名匪首、爲朱大和尙·孫元善·李小七·戚麥等、大股約數百人、小股亦數十人、入春以來、被害者已有二百餘家、被匪殺害者約六七十人、受禍最慘者、莫如東鄕雙京張姓、一家五口、均爲匪放火燒死、</p>
<p>諸城、自高（桂滋）范（熙績）兩部在該縣開火以來、城内民房、多爲高部拆毀、</p>
<p>移作防禦工事、居民受砲火之殃者、更不知凡幾、城外殷實之户、早已遷避他處、</p>
<p>無力遷移者、非遭土匪刦掠、即爲官兵抓去、充作輪送隊、據該縣來青避難者云、</p>
<p>城邑附近各村莊、已十室九空、距城稍遠之村莊、又因土匪遍地、時被慘禍、大有求生不得求死不能之概、</p>
<p>平度、平度與膠縣毘連、膠縣大股土匪、時至平度架票、據查該縣被綁者、亦有數十餘家、損失不下七八萬元、各縣被禍之家、雖遭匪害、無到縣府報案者、因報案官廳亦不能爲力、徒結怨於匪、故雖遭慘禍、亦祇自怨命苦而已、（四月七日）</p>

<p>字跡斑斑、挻拔蒼勁、刻寫俱工、洵屬漢初之物、碑文未記、但有驃騎將軍字樣、</p>
<p>前清鳥里雅蘇台參贊官（治瑞）曾一臨其地、令隨從拓印多張、回京分散故舊、距今已三十年矣、早散遺無存、吾人欲重得漢之刻寳、非俟外蒙收回、則决不敢輕游元都觀也、聞蒙古人稱此碑爲碑神、保存甚力、祭神之餘、毎以香楮分之、碑基稍有烟痕耳、（四月一日）</p>

<p>滬上半時苦受包圍</p>
<p>姚恩漢獨得七個球</p>
<p>昨日下午二時男子籃球舉行决賽、參舉奪標戰者、爲天津上海兩隊、慕兩隊素日威名、來作壁上觀者、籃球塲上擠得水洩不通、天津陣線、最初即以南闰開五虎出馬、上海爲黄運利梁國權左右鋒何通中鋒汪今鵬陸锺恩、左右衛中途因天津右衛王鍚良受足傷、遂以何步雲代戰、交戰之初、上海隊即處處被困、一籌莫展、黄運利梁國權更不能近籃一步、唐寳琨首以罰中一分首開紀錄、上海雖努力防守、難敵五虎衝突、唐寳琨尤見活躍、恒使對方極難捉摸、上半時之紀錄、</p>
<p>爲十七對四、天津勝、上海之四分、係梁國權及陸锤錘恩各罰中一分、何通擲中一球、</p>
<p>休息第、易地再戰、上海隊再易陣線、以魏海青爲中鋒、談逹驊代黄運利、任右鋒、接觸之初、上海隊仍是心慌意亂、談逹驊亦未見順利、天津隊劉建常罰中一分、首開紀錄、其後相持頗久、上海似稍得勢、時孔廣益已代汪、今鵬任右鋒、亦擲中一球、天津即宣告休息、以遠東名將姚恩漢代魏蓬雲出場、天津隊如打一枚嗎啡針、精神復振、姚恩漢遠射近攻、無不中的、一人獨得六球、</p>
<p>罰中一球、與唐寳琨、眞是一對搭擋、天津右衛</p>
<p>王鍚良、旋亦扶傷進場、上海僅仗孔廣益一人作戰、孤掌難嗎、但下半時上海隊作戰稍佳、頗能應付一切、苟上半時有此精神、紀錄不至相差若是之巨也、下半時雙方得分爲二十一對十九、天津勝、總分三十八對二十三、男子籃球錦標、遂歸天津、</p>

<p>（王開攝）</p>
<p>昨日下午三時半女子籃球决賽、上海甲與北平隊作戰、北平選手體格魁偉、發球力量較上海爲大、上海則以傳球活潑見勝、雙方勢均力敵、作戰極爲勇烈第一時間五比六、北平勝、第二時間滬隊大事反攻、前鋒陳英瑞更爲出色、結果三比五、上海勝、上半時總分爲十對九、上海僅勝一分、北平隊吃虧在罰球之不準確</p>
<p>最後奮門</p>
<p>第二時間、雙方接戰更爲勇烈、紀錄亦極接近相差恒祇一二分、觀衆喊殺聲鶩天動地、第三時間結果爲七對五、上海勝、時總分爲十七對十四、上海勝、第四時間、間雙方作最後之奮門、滬隊名將陳英瑞出而復入、連續玫進二球、觀衆均以爲上海有希望矣、不料北平中鋒黄淑愼奮其神威、連得六分、如是雙方相持至最後銀苖聲中、</p>
<p>宣告完畢、紀錄版上高懸二十四對二十四、分數相等、但按諸女子籃球規則、並無延長規定、倘分數相等時、當以擲中多寡爲比例、經查記分簿結果北平擲中十球、上海九球、遂判决勝利屬於北平、女籃錦標、終被北平奪去、上海誠可謂不幸者矣、</p>

<p>丨昨二對一勝香港丨</p>
<p>競爭頗劇烈</p>
<p>廣東香港二隊、於十日下午一時、舉行男排球奪標决賽、觀衆逹三千人、備極擁擠、酣戰二小時、</p>
<p>名盛一時之香港隊、竟以一比二受克於廣東、茲將比賽情况、略誌於後、</p>
<p>昨敗於粤之香港排球隊</p>
<p>（粤隊見昨報）</p>
<p>（中華攝）</p>
<p>港先得手</p>
<p>午後三刻、二隊隊員戎裝入塲、略作緩和之綀習、迨時間旣届、裁判員笛聲一鳴、劇戰開始、香港鄒秉新發球、連得二分、先開紀錄、廣東首此即遭失敗、港隊曾經全又獲四分、成四與零之比、聲勢煊赫</p>
<h3 id="c104">各懹戒懼 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>但粤隊並不以小挫而氣　、全隊精神反形振奮、</p>
<p>前中二排搭擋進攻、頗形順利、亦得有三分、至是雙方競爭愈烈、且彼此實力不相伯仲、各懹戒懼、不敢稍有疏忽、欲求進展極爲不易、相持良久、香港均佔優勢、先以十一比三整陣</p>
<h3 id="c105">全力反攻 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>當時觀衆心理、咸以港隊必得勝利、不意廣東忽出全力大舉反攻、前排黎連楹屢展其迅速之壓撀、均能乘隙命中、因此分數遞增、成八比十一</p>
<p>之比例、軍心爲之一振、</p>
<h3 id="c106">港陣搖動 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>港隊見敵勢强盛、陣局漸形慌亂、且因操之過切、反予對方以可乘之機、廣東愈迫愈緊、未幾忽以十八比十五轉勝、港隊雖竭力掙扎、終難追逑、第一局以十七比二十一敗北、</p>
<h3 id="c107">滬網球女選手（右）蒯叔平 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>

<p>博得彩聲</p>
<p>休息數妥鐘、繼續再戰、雙方攻打更見激烈、表演非常精彩、博得觀衆彩聲不少、廣東中排三人、壓撃得法、勝球甚多、彼此平均進展、難分軒輊、俄而港隊又以十一比九領先、及換方以後、</p>
<p>港隊陳鍚炳發球、又連得四分、再經數度來往、</p>
<p>即以二十一比十八獲勝二隊各勝一局、</p>
<h3 id="c108">决勝關鍵 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>以後則第三局、實爲决勝之關鍵、亦即錦標之所繋、故雙方莫不出其全力以爭、港隊健將陳鍚炳、屢施其靨撃之手段、以冀殺敵之功、無如粤方前排關門之術甚精、殊難得逞、分數忽起忽落、互相追隨、在各成十八以後、粤隊三次發球得手、獲得最後之勝利、此次排球錦標、遂爲廣東所奪得、</p>

<p>以二比零勝滬甲</p>
<p>廣東與滬甲二隊、在過去之比賽中、均有優異之成績、其實力亦屬不相上下、惟粤隊攻勢較强是其特長、昨日决賽、廣東果以二比零獲勝、良以技能有參差、固非僥倖可以致勝也、</p>
<p>三時開寳、最初形勢非常平衡、在粤方以八比六領先之後、滬甲黄杏芳發球、忽連得六分、反轉勝勢、於是廣東力加戒備、後排設防堅守、前排努力襲撃、果能漸形得手、司徒徽復奮勇立功、</p>
<p>一次發球得有八分之多、而造成十六與十三之比例、頃刻之際又連獲五分、以二十一比十六勝第一局、</p>
<p>第二局中、廣東乘勝進攻、節節勝利、滬甲愈形不支、發球又屢失機、雖曾一度進至十二比十三之數、惜以後無甚進展、卒又以十六比二十一失敗、廣東連勝二局、奪得錦標、兩隊陣線列左、</p>

<p>女子網球决賽、天津對上海、九日已將兩單打賽畢、天津上海各勝一組、天津梁佩瑤勝上海蒯淑平二比○、上海李蓮勝天津梁佩瑜二比○、昨日上午之雙打、頗能影響第三第四之兩組單打、九時起賽、梁氏姊妹斜飛横射、手段高强、以六比四、六比三之比數、連勝上海李蓮蒯淑平二盤、</p>
<p>裁判員郝伯陽、</p>
<p>勝負情形</p>
<p>上海蒯淑平首先發球、繼而天津、上海一下手連勝二局、聲勢煊嚇、李蓮發球、天津雖勝一局、上海反手又勝、天津急起直追、成三三和局、旋成</p>
<p>四四、李蒯先勝後和、漸露慌張、連失二局、梁氏姊妹、遂以六比四勝第一盤、</p>
<p>接續再戰、上海發球、天津又連失二局、佩瑜佩瑤、不慌不忙、以二比二和、又成三三之和、此後、上海漸露疲乏、蒯淑平疲於奔命、抵禦頗難、</p>
<p>天津以逸待勞、連勝三局、又以六比三勝第二盤　　天津之勝</p>
<p>天津之能勝上海、可述之如下、（一）不慌不忙、起先雖連失二局、態度仍絕鎭靜、迨敵人慌亂、乃乘機進取、（二）能利用敵人弱點、上海李蓮繋球頗穏、殊可險球、而蒯淑平去球過兇、用心太急、乃時時見球落網前或飛界外、天津得此弱點、及拚命將球撃向蒯去、使李蓮無得球機會、於是蒯淑平精疲力竭、李蓮獨木難支、一失再失、天津遂勝、</p>

<p>大會於今日下午給獎後、對於各選手之歸去、已由招待組商通路局、多掛車輛二十餘輛、以免擁擠、準明日上午早車返申、參加上海各校之歡迎會、</p>

<p>向隅之憾　昨日籃球排球兩塲、未及比赛賽時、即已擠滿看客、而坐臺之後、援木而升、</p>
<p>攀柱以待者、尤不可勝數、有某女校全體學生、</p>
<p>準時而至、見已無立足之地、只得抱向隅之憾、</p>
<p>内有一生戲謂同學曰、今日來意不誠、以致罰諸位面壁、</p>
<p>熱昏了人　最後數幕、幕幕精采、昨日杭垣熱度驟高、觀衆熱忱、亦隨天氣以激增、所苦者一般小朋友、擠在人業中、旣看不到、又走不開、三時許在籃球塲已熱昏了兩個、又有一壯年人暈倒在地、均由市立病院救護隊槓出救治、</p>
<p>烈日薰炙、氣味難當、各塲中聞有同樣之昏倒者已不下十餘起、</p>
<p>吃官司去　籃球塲東南角、在兩少年因立地爭看、竟致用武、一人左眼旁被打紅、爭</p>
<p>眇不已、警察調解、仍糾纏互毆、遂一同帶出會塲、送局究辦、因看熱閙而吃官司、殊不値得、</p>
<p>像面線點　排球塲四圍觀衆、立成方形、像一面、中間的網像一線、球像一點、倘使給形數檢字法的發明家張鳳博士到塲看見、又要大吹其面線點的法螺、</p>
<p>推廣外貨　桂格麥片公司送各選手及指導員裁判員等以優待劵、可到杭州青年會西餐部當試桂格麥片一客、不取分文、其券上说説明、據調有養生保健之功效云、</p>
<p>提倡國貸　上海杭州兩國貸工廠聯合會、此届在杭舉行流動展覧會、對於各省選手、</p>
<p>亦訂有優待辦法、凡於今明兩日佩有選手符號者、至該均簽名後、可抽籤一枝、毎枝均有國貨贈品、最多者有國貨呢絨及布疋、最少者亦有國貸之糖果及牙粉、提倡國貨諸君之用心、殊爲可佩、</p>
<p>些須薄禮　浙省省政府及省黨部、以健兒雲集、都係遠道而來、爰於日昨之夜、在大禮堂招待各選手、當時除演説及表演游藝外、每人尙得點心一袋、及杭地土產一包、據云該項土產内容、如茶葉絲織風景等品、每包約値大洋兩元、共計分去一千九百包之多、</p>
<p>提取一空　大會定今日閉幕、故健兒留杭祇有一宵、昨日下午紛紛向保管銀錢處提取存欵、所存微乎其微、均向市上購買土產、以便携歸、</p>

<p>馬古烈博士在南中演講</p>
<p>法國敎育部特派考察中國高等敎育專員馬古烈博士、於九日下午三時應南中章校長之約、在南中一院大禮堂演講到法領事與中央黨政機關來賓及該校員生共一千數百人、首由南中校長章警秋、致觀迎詞、並謂博士不但能説中國話並能</p>
<p>深切研究中國文學、曷勝欽仰、繼由馬古烈博士登台説中國話、不用翻譯、謂本人在巴黎雖研究中國語言文學、但缺少經騐、恐多所不能明暸、還請原諒、鄙人深願與諸位有志之士、及青年學子爲學術上研究之談話、但千頭萬緖、從何説起、現想緊要問題中國與歐洲有關係者言之、即歐洲各國對於漢學之研究、歐洲人研究中國漢學很早、在梁朝歐洲人旅行中國、歸爲筆記以及作爲種種研究心得、但彼尙屬初步、明末清初更有進步、十六世紀末年乃至十七十八世紀並有文學哲學政治經濟等學家頗多著作、出版行世、</p>
<p>十九世紀關於中國文學書籍如哲學·歷史·等等、必應有盡有、可見歐洲人對於中國文學研究之程度、歐洲人翻譯中國文學書很多、研究所得成</p>
<p>績至今仍繼續不斷、歐洲各國、設有漢文學校研</p>
<p>究中國文學者甚多、尤以法國爲最、法巴黎研究</p>
<p>中國文學者有四處、（一）東方語言學校、（二）漢文專門學校、（三）巴黎大學、（四）法國有學院、此外尙有中圖書館、研究會社、東方語言圖書館其中富</p>
<p>藏中國名人書籍、法國關於研究中文之圖書館除公立六處外、還有私立三處、法國漢學家、</p>

<p>學之士也、英德四國亦研究中國文學、英倫敦有東方語言學校及劍橋圖書館等藏書亦富、德國柏林有東方語言學校圖書館藏書亦夥、其大學亦有中國敎授、敎授漢學、此外如意大利·羅馬·波蘭·荷蘭等國研究中國文學、以后進步、</p>
<p>不待自言、歐洲人研究中國文學者頗多翻譯、</p>
<p>經書如十三經已翻譯過幾十次、（惟公羊　梁未譯）哲學子書如道德經已譯七十三種莊子列子、</p>
<p>呂氏者秋·墨子·淮南子·抱朴子荀子等書皆經翻譯、史書如通鑑綱目、司馬遷史記皆用法文譯出、集書如八大家文集尙未完全譯出、又文學史亦僅譯出一部分、而杜甫詩英人已譯四百多首、</p>
<p>李白詩亦有譯著、又中國文化大網、詩詞小説、</p>

<p>大會競賽股職員△主任吳</p>
<p>邦偉</p>
<p>王開攝</p>
<p>開始譯成一部中國五代史、以上係歐洲各國研究漢學之大槪情形也、至歐洲要研究中國漢學者因中國開化最早、四千餘年之古國文自有其相當價値、在歐洲人思想及需要上、甚有研究</p>
<p>之興趣、就鄙人觀察中國文化如彼近來工商業、進步如此中國是文明古國、歐洲是新進的國家物質方面、中國間有所采取、歐洲人亦深欽仰中國文化、所謂精神文明與物質文明交換溝通國際前途、利賴實深、末由章校長致詞答謝、並謂法領事因諸位坐久改日再來演講、至四時許、攝影散會、</p>

<p>永安公司築小壩</p>
<p>兩商輪不能進口</p>
<p>京滬飛機未飛行</p>
<p>連日滬上氣候倐變、雨絲風片、連續而來、寒食乍過、便若黄梅時節、昨晨早曦初上、陽光普照、方謂天日放晴、詎知頃刻之間、陰霾四合、悶濕中人、又有欲雨之勢、於是乍雨乍霽、一晨未歇、午前半小時、忽爾烏雲滿天、大多延頸相待、以</p>
<p>爲頃刻間必將大雨、孰知雨師駕久不到、</p>
<p>而天光愈變愈黑、慘黯之象、漸進漸甚、</p>
<p>晌午忽晦、幾如薄暮、正午十二時、猶傍晚六七時也、</p>

<p>馬路積水、大雨時、低窪之處、變爲澤國、馬路兩旁、行人稀少、南京路日昇樓一帶、地勢本低、永安公司内積水如渠、顧客爲之裹足、其靠英華街之門口、</p>
<p>因水勢如潮、不得不謀一救急辦法、乃臨</p>

<p>縣政府偵悉是案主犯潛逃來滬、兩次派警到滬拘捕、始終未獲、警士共來六人、逗留日久、川資告罄、正擬今日返無爲復命、詎於昨日午後、在邑廟避雨、無意中巧與正犯相遇、遂行擒獲、事雖細微、</p>
<p>然情頗奇特、茲將是案顚末、探錄於次、</p>
<p>綁子殺父、皖人萬志寛、世居安徽無爲縣北鄉萬家屯地方、務農爲業、置有</p>
<p>良田三百餘畝、有土財主之稱、因是爲匪</p>
<p>徒所注意、萬妻王氏、老夫婦年逾不惑、</p>
<p>方得一子、於是愛如掌珠、取名小呆子、</p>
<p>年十二歲、詎於去歲舊歷八月十四日夜間、忽來綁匪十餘人、將小呆子架去、萬因護奪愛子、被匪開槍擊斃、</p>
<p>堂兄主犯、是案發生後、轟動全邑</p>
<p>、無爲縣長張四維、尤爲重視、飭令該縣所有警務機關限日破獲、時逾數月、僅拘獲嫌疑犯五人、輾轉偵查、方悉呈案主犯、即肉票之堂兄萬國相、但久已潛逃至滬、且地址不明、張縣長兩次派員來滬拘捕、始終未獲、此次於本月一日又復飭令法警宣文成來滬訪緝、務獲解究、</p>
<p>狹路相逢、宣警來滬、共帶夥友五</p>
<p>人、抵滬後、即寄居於法租界馬浪路四十號友人處、終日在外分頭查訪、時逾旬</p>
<p>日、影踪毫無、所備川資、已將告罄、擬定</p>
<p>於今日返無爲復命、昨日上午、宣警帶同夥友等至邑廟内游覽、游畢擬由方浜路</p>
<p>大門而出、時適大雨滂沱、宣警即在廟門</p>
<p>前避雨、少頃忽來一人、衣灰色布衫、頭戴呢帽、直趨廟前、口呼大雨、宣警等正</p>
<p>在觀望雨勢、忽聞同鄉口音、衆皆注目、</p>
<p>斯人非他、蓋即綁子殺父之正犯萬國相也、</p>
<p>主犯口供、宣警等暼見萬國相、喜出望外、遂加拘捕、一併帶入一區二分所、呈明前情、並將咨文呈騐、高所長向</p>
<p>該犯詰問一過、據供年三十二歲、向習米糧木業、萬志寛乃其四胞叔、伊父名寳成、居長、否認有槍殺叔父及綁架堂弟行爲並供彼於去歲舊歷九月十三日由原籍動身、曾向叔母王氏前聲明、離無後首</p>
<p>至常州岳家、當月二十日來申一次、同年十月半回常、此次來滬方兩日云云、高所長據供後以案情重大、隨於當晚備文申解司法科懲辦、</p>

<p>昨晨解法院審訊</p>
<p>死者確爲劉義青</p>
<p>葛文成係一幼童</p>
<p>彭子劼否認一切</p>
<p>八日上午、北京路發生紛擾事件、由巡</p>
<p>捕當塲擊斃一名、擒獲工人學生等八名、後經特區地方法院及江蘇高等分院騐訊各情、已兩記本報、其死者姓名、當出事之後、即傳爲劉義靑、但捕房因未調查確實、故猶不能斷定、迨至前日午間、</p>
<p>由戈登路捕房探長沈崇禮·探目花友山·</p>
<p>探員徐德成·協同西探目丕布等、緝獲葛文成彭子劼黃蓬等三名、始證實死者係劉義靑、毫無疑義、同時各探員並搜獲軍械及各項反動印刷品書籍等件甚多、依據私藏軍械罪、應歸特區地方法院受理、</p>
<p>惟此案涉及反革命行爲、則應由江蘇高等法院第二分院受理、捕房乃於昨晨先解至特區地方法院、經該院刑庭推事孫原批解高等分院訊辦、</p>
<p>捕房起訴罪名、遂於午後二時、</p>
<p>將全案人證、轉解高等分院、由刑庭長宋沅特開第二法庭研訊、首由捕房律師汝保彝陳述起訴罪名及經過事實、略謂捕房依據刑律第二百條起訴、該三被告私藏軍火、惟現在已有軍用槍砲法頒佈、如庭上以爲本案不適用刑律第二百條、當可以軍用槍砲法第一條起訴、同時對第二被告彭子劼·第三被告黃蓬、以刑律第一零三條之反革命罪起訴、</p>
<p>黃包車夫告密、至本案事實、緣四月八日上午十時、北京路北京大戲院門首發生紛擾、經巡捕擊斃暴徒一名、當</p>
<p>時不知死者爲誰、捕房調查至昨日上午十時半、忽據黃包車夫王阿三向華探目花友山報告、謂八日午後四時、有一小</p>
<p>孩、即獲案第一被告葛文成、與一工人模樣者、雇渠黃包車、從海防路五百八十七號門牌、裝儎籐篋舖蓋書包各一件、車往愛文義路七百八十一號婦人封氏家、及</p>
<p>抵該氏門首、書包内忽有手槍一支漏出、</p>
<p>彼等乃給車夫費小洋四角、着勿聲張、事後特來報告等語、</p>
<p>工人不知姓名、該探得報、遂與中西探馳往調查、據黃封氏云、伊因見其</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>行李内藏有槍械、不欲容留、彼等已去、</p>
<p>該氏對此工人模樣者、不知姓名、僅言小</p>
<p>孩係在武定路卅三號建南中學讀書、並</p>
<p>導該探等赴建南中學、始將葛文成拘獲、</p>
<p>關於各種物證、據葛孩云、槍械藏於赫德路一千五百九十二號、該探等乃與葛同往、在該屋之前樓第二被告彭子劼室内、先由葛將其寄存籐篋開啓、</p>
<p>發現盒子砲一支、實彈十粒、手槍一支、</p>
<p>實彈三粒、時彭及第三被告黃蓬均在室内、遂一併拘獲、此外復搜得印刷品書籍甚多、就中有小張之紙三張、上書有收到槍械數目之字樣、而文件内則有信函一封、均屬討論共産文字、又有文稿一紙、</p>
<p>係研究印度甘地主義之文字、其書籍中有一册、題爲廣州暴動號、此皆最可注意者、其餘各件、不須一一説明、請庭上察</p>
<p>閲、自能明瞭、總之所獲書籍、大都係馬</p>
<p>克思主義之讀物、以上皆關於物證者、</p>
<p>黃蓬前曾犯案、至人證則葛文成</p>
<p>可以證明、死者爲其義父、八日之晨、死</p>
<p>者自海防路五八七號寓所、携帶手槍出</p>
<p>外、未幾返寓、將槍藏置、徒手復出、遂被擊斃於北京路、其工人模樣者、據葛云、</p>
<p>係死者之友、但第三被告黃蓬被拘時、尙否認彼亦住該屋、然據捕房事後調查、黃</p>
<p>確住該屋之亭子間、故捕房現將再往該亭子間搜查、且黃於昔年因發散傳單、被</p>
<p>捕解院、科罰金十五元、彼時其名彭納云　　西探目之報告、繼由西探目丕布報告往赫德路搜查情形、謂第三被告黃蓬、其時言伊適由南京來滬、寓江灣某大學、所獲各物、除槍彈係在葛之籐箱内抄出外、餘件係在彭之寫字檯及抽屜内搜得、建南中學之生徒宿舍、在武定路三十六號、昨日午後四時、已往搜查、抄有反對日本帝國主義之書籍、該校校長即係黃封氏之夫、今尙未拿獲、而寄宿舍之學生、則皆已遷移云云、</p>
<p>手槍忽然墮地、次據見證黃包車夫王阿三證稱、雇伊車輛者、係成年之人、而由葛乘坐、及推至愛文義路黃封氏家門首、手槍從書包内墮地、葛孩遂往叩門、由黃封氏啓扉、葛孩先給我車資兩角、</p>
<p>而該氏又加給兩角、着勿聲張、嗣我乃向包探報告云云、</p>
<p>黃封氏之供詞、又據婦人黃封氏供稱、年二十七歲、四川重慶人、來滬已年餘、丈夫名黃成、現年二十八歲、前學期在某大學爲敎授、本學期賦閒家居、葛之母與我同鄉、上月二十六日、葛母回籍、託我照料其子、昨葛來叩門、我啓視見車夫、正與爭論、我即加給兩角、着車夫</p>
<p>勿將手槍洩露、蓋恐葛獲咎、嗣我因葛行李内旣有此項危險物品、不能容留、命葛携去、</p>
<p>裁縫陳述種種、又據海防路崇安里五八七號二房東裁縫郭正記證稱、葛之父於正月間獨來租賃亭子間、自言湘籍、在交易所送信、妻傭於人、子在學校</p>
<p>讀書、我視其約三十餘歲、時而長服、時或短褐、賃居後、有一婦來過一次、其子葛文成、則來過數次、昨葛與一人又來、</p>
<p>謂其父在途跌傷、已送醫院、需資調治、</p>
<p>遂將行李取去、我因其旣未欠租、故任遷徙等語、</p>
<p>葛童不知年齡、宋庭長即點傳被告葛文成、見係一童子、乃命鵠立案下、</p>
<p>首訊以年歲、詎葛對於自已年齡、尙不能</p>
<p>悉、初稱十六歲、繼言民國六年誕生、訊以生肖、亦不能知、後又云係由其母告知爲六年誕生、而其父則囑伊説十六歲、死者名劉義青、乃伊之後父、伊母已經回籍、將伊託於黃封氏、據後父之友某工人云、伊後係在滬西做工作、伊嘗詢以做何</p>
<p>種工作、則該工人不肯相告、後父被槍擊斃、亦係該工人前來報告、並代收拾一</p>
<p>切、於捲舖蓋時、始見枕底藏有一槍、嗣將行李車往黃封氏家門首、槍忽漏出、乃另雇車輛運往彭家、車資係該工人所給、</p>
<p>彭係在學校時相識、嗣捕房前往彭家搜查、於籐篋内又抄出較短之一槍、此槍前</p>
<p>未見過等語、</p>
<p>彭子劼之供述、又據彭子劼供、</p>
<p>年二十七歲、江西萍鄉縣人、來滬將及兩載、現任羣治大學哲學敎授、滬寓僅我夫</p>
<p>婦兩人、黃蓬係我前在原籍任中學敎員時之學生、彼新自南京來訪我、當係研究</p>
<p>學問、庭上訊以搜獲之各種印刷品書籍、</p>
<p>及大小圖章十餘顆、係誰之物、彭多諉爲他人所有、而又不將所有者詳述、僅稱均係王姓之物、王不知在何處、餘詞亦多支吾、</p>
<p>黃蓬過滬訪師、嗣訊據黃蓬供、</p>

<p>— 妍千</p>
<p>嘗聞革命黨人述某烈士之憤談曰。「</p>
<p>西湖非塡平不可。大約當時有從事革命之人。爲愛游西湖。致忽其所務。以是激出此憤談也。此外。常聞人之形容西湖美者。輒曰西湖醉人。實則是語非特不足形容西湖於萬一。且尤足爲西湖辱也。</p>
<p>蓋西湖之美。自有其種種美在。固無所謂醉人不醉人也。以意度之。自有西湖。當即有旣游西湖而形容。不出西湖之美之人。迺大言曰。西湖醉人。而西湖竟爲一部分人誤認爲祇能醉人而已。</p>
<p>今年四月一日。三民主義的全國運動大會開會於西湖之濱。頓覺明艶之湖山間。充滿不少雄壯之氣。大可使善閙醉人醉人年頭醉到年尾大有醉生夢死之慨之輩。一振其心神。而取消其西湖醉人之妙説也。</p>
<p>自今以後。吾願游西湖者。莫再爲醉人說所誤。而大做其醉人以爲雅。吾願游西湖者。見西湖之清漣。而想象運動員之純潔與健康。而明瞭運動之足以致精强。見雙峰之挺拔。而想象運動員之魁梧而多壽之景色。而想象運動員之充滿美之精神。而明瞭運動爲根本致美之術。如此如此。方各不負西湖。亦可不致虚有一游。</p>
<p>且可爲深能瞭解三民主義的全國運動大會第一次會所以在西湖舉行之至意矣。</p>
<p>作者爲此文封寄自由談時。深願國人今後知運動之不可不尙。而遂以此達到自由平等之目的也。則他日之游湖者。或將因自由談而憶及區區乎。一笑。</p>

<p>忙裏偷閒。返里旬日。聞聞見見。略摭一二較雋者。</p>
<p>誌之如左。</p>
<p>畫苑祭酒顧鶴逸之山水。與故陸廉夫氏齊名。鬻値之昂。視陸氏而倍蓰之。往往一扇册之微。動輒四五十金。即奉潤而求之者。亦非催索若干次不能獲。</p>
<p>蓋其積件殊多。且有時仿古爲贋品。售數百千金不爲奇。故與其爲已作。母寗爲古人作之得善價而沽也。不料前月忽患中風病。以藥石之力。得保厥生。</p>
<p>然已肢體不遂。從此不能再事丹靑揮灑矣。惜哉。</p>
<p>觀前有賣狀元糕者。其人本世家子。暱名校書金鳳而傾其産。且染煙霞癖。淪爲賤販。更嗜麴蘖。酒後輒喜告人以往日綺事。聞者引爲笑柄。春來忽一病纒綿。長眠不起。其遺　由名畫家吳子深氏代爲收歛。洵積德之舉也。</p>
<h3 id="c188">清風明月廬讀畫瑣記 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 王梅噱</p>
<p>清風明月廬。在滬西愛文義路遷善里許厪父先生之寓廬也。吾友申君石伽近自西子湖頭。來居於此。老友王君潛樓亦來滬。皆應滬人士之求。而以丹靑壽世者。厪父固風雅士。故樂得而延攬之。</p>
<p>但潛樓别有棲息所。間日來此一揮灑耳。</p>
<p>上星期日「四月六日」午後二時造厪父之廬訪石伽作半日談。潛樓亦適至。兩君皆工山水。是日見其所作屏條堂幅斗方横幀。琳瑯滿壁。幾已歷盡名山大川。翛翛然有塵外之感。最後各出一便面見示。潛樓畫松而上署以不佞之别署。蒼皮勁節。</p>
<p>儼然如千歲物、百朋之錫。何以過之。石伽所繪爲山水。疏朗之氣。撲人眉宇。而自題五言一首。寄嘅遙深。尤能出入於陶韓之間。其詩云「何處發清嘯。遙睇深樹林。荒溪碧雲上。蕭寥鸞鳳音。草石本無姓。巖泉亦沉冥。借問此何年。天醉殊未醒。」余方手披口沬。不忍遽釋。潛樓猝然問曰。夢魚何人。君之友耶。余曰。然則謔君何甚也。因出是日自由談夢魚所作「</p>
<p>彩鳳雙飛到海西」一篇指而示之日。此中有云梅璩女士公子藴華。想夢魚以令嬡有丈夫氣。故不言女而稱公子。必又以君無丈夫氣。故謂君女士、合座盡笑。余日。</p>
<p>夢魚不作此惡劇。即手民之誤。亦偶然耳。然鄙人願與吾女互易其釵弁。且深謝手民之解此糾紛也。皆問日。有説乎。日有。吾女名藴華。我及門中又有女弟子亦名藴華亦姓王氏。更同習繪事。各有門徑。三年前夢魚主編駱駝畫報。即爲聲明。</p>
<p>謂「吳門王藴華梅璩之女弟子。嶺南王藴華梅璩之女公子。」然上海杭州之見其作品者。猶以贋鼎互疑。許士騏夫婦日前招飲。亦以吾女素習西法畫。疑今之畫仕女者爲彼一藴華。許夫人楊縵華疑之更甚。</p>
<p>今手民一誤而吾女易釵而弁。可知决非吳門畫山水之藴華矣。若梅璩之老邁。呼馬呼牛。皆無關係。衆方含笑。會有客來參觀。問石伽畫宗何派。厪父代爲答日。</p>
<p>畫法渾厚有書卷氣。蓋努力於元山樵陶大痴諸家。而源又出於四王。能不爲四王所拘者也。客頷之。余亦幸得聞畫家之玄秘。拉雜書之爲讀畫瑣記云。</p>

<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>報紙爲一種廣告與新聞之刊載物。閲畢之後。舍少數文人保存外。每取之作包銅元糊板壁之用。從未聞能充其他用處者。淮陰馮某。竟以報紙製成被褥、作保護體温貼身之用。事之奇特。誠非吾人所能逆料也。</p>
<p>馮年已七十餘。處境極貧但嗜閲本報成癖。家無擔石。積存本報却有數十年之多。夫本報只能供灌輸知識之用。不能作生財之道。馮睡眠時。只一單衾蔽體。去年冬。天氣奇寒。馮因寒意侵襲。身冷如鐵。乃異想天開。取架上舊報紙展開。每張用漿糊連之。連成若干張。長短廣闊。與彼體相若。然後照樣糊成百餘片。疊成一堆。用線連之。製成時。與被無異。馮取而裹諸身。較諸單衾蔽體。却温暖得多。</p>
<p>馮日前向人云。余蓋此被。已數月之久。</p>
<p>貼身處稍覺不潔。只須扯去一層。則又潔凈如新。春二三月。天氣由奇寒而温暖。</p>
<p>余之被一層層扯去。亦由奇厚而輕薄。旣不須洗滌。又適合於天時。世之窮措大。</p>
<p>若能照余法倣行。則彼棉絮胎與大被單。</p>
<p>將無所用之矣。</p>
<p>以上事實。係余友黃君逸民見告者從。</p>

<p>暖氣潛催。杏花新放。眞陽春之大放點綴也。杏之花葉。與梅相似。爲落葉亞喬木。實黃熟。甘而不酸。搗仁爲汁。</p>
<p>可治咳病。此昔人所以有莫言結實供人噉。破核還堪作藥材之句。酉陽雜俎。濟南郡東南有分流山。多杏。大如梨。黃如橘。謂之漢武杏。然詢諸魯人。均云未之聞見。大約佳種已早絕矣。種杏之法。將核帶肉。埋於糞土中。至春移栽。否則實小味苦。栽宜近人家。不可太密。密則疏花少實。園藝家不可不知也。</p>
<p>學友金季鶴之尊翁鶴望丈。爲吳下寓公有年矣。所居費韋齋先生宅。有赭杏一樹。高尋丈。茂美可喜。前歲花時。丈徙居新橋巷。然以赭杏爛漫。不能與琴樽書畫同移焉。頗以爲憾。書畫家畢曛谷知之。</p>
<p>爲繪折枝杏一大幅。名日嫁杏圖以贈。丈有長歌詠其事。傳爲一時佳話。按嫁杏。</p>
<p>由來已古。文昌雜錄。李冠卿堂前杏。花多而不實。一媒姥笑日。來春與嫁了此杏。冬深。忽携酒。索處女裙繫樹。辭祝而去。來春結子無數。此事跡近荒誕。供人一笑而已。</p>
<p>趙丈雲壑。海上之名畫家也。居停但君杜宇。因予之熟識丈也。託求繪一杏林春燕圖。旣成。丈忽發覺繁英中。翩翻差池。</p>
<p>適爲八鳥之數。恐爲俗人所取笑。乃重作一幀以易之。予并携之返。然杜宇不以八鳥爲忤。什襲藏之。予因此亦攫得其一。</p>
<p>頗引爲倖事云。</p>
<p>西餐館有杏仁豆腐一色。以杏仁者製於豆腐中。和以糖漿。藏諸冰箱。啖之甘芳可口。爲消暑之佳品。</p>
<p>杏之佳話。疊見古書。如孔子休坐乎杏壇之上。又董奉居廬山。爲人治病。重者種杏五株。輕者一株。號董仙杏林。又郭子儀自杏園渡河圍衛州。有杏園渡遺蹟。</p>
<p>又宋祁有紅杏枝頭春意閙句。遂呼之紅杏尙書。又仙人劉根隱於杏山。又上林苑有蓬萊杏。東海都尉於吉所獻。</p>
<p>杏之佳什。如玉樓人醉杏花天。又梅花已謝杏花新。又深巷明朝賣杏花。又杏苞如臉半開香。又杏枝偃蹇花　　娜。又文杏堂前千樹紅。又名園相倚杏交花。又女郎折得殷勤看。道是春風及第花。又粉薄紅輕掩歛羞。花中占斷得風流。又羞逢柳眼三分白。分得桃腮一笑紅。美不勝收也。</p>

<p>金價跌入五百兩</p>
<p>打破醖釀局面</p>
<p>激降四兩三錢</p>
<p>市程步步向退　昨十日標金、突趨疲風、已敲破五百兩大關、多日未有重大變化、而今忽見激跌矣、惟前後市、均僅二兩餘起伏、至外匯稍見鬆動、自阜市即開低盤、蓋受大條銀放長之影響、嗣後藴伏於五百兩内外、但晋安餘大等頗有賣出、而買進頭寸萬興順利也、往後漸趨低峯、</p>
<p>遽爾跌進四百九十九兩以内、迨後市福昌餘大等蜂湧賣出、順利萬興繼續購進、市况極形萎絀大有一落千丈之勢、同業心理大致看跌、乃匯票尤頽、近期日匯銀行售價一兩零四分二五遠期一兩零三分七五、最後猝跌爲九十七兩之間、至英倫銀條已長十六分之一、銀價加四分之一、</p>
<p>晨開即降一兩七、五月份標金開盤四百九十九兩七錢、即已跌去一兩七錢、毛盤復超出五百兩○○五六錢、乃買户似勁、而匯票則平、日商銀行買去遠期日金一兩零四分三七五、旣而售出近期一兩零五分一二五、至先令揭佈時爲五百兩、掛牌勿動、内部漸見鬆絀、四月份英金銀行對做十一便士二五、五月安逹中法吸進十一便士三一二五、遠期東匯華銀行僅售出一兩零三分七五、塲内賣户尤湧、至十點左右降爲九十八兩二三錢、以後四月英金和豐東方曾已對做十一便士二五、浙江買五月日金一兩○四分三七五、。零户等補進、故回上一兩零、十點半爲九兩三四錢、至十一點後仍見軟弱、麥加利買遠期英金十一便士四三七五、乃降至九十八兩六七錢、正午收盤九兩、</p>
<p>午後低峯到七兩一、後市開盤計九十九兩次爲九兩四錢、市况頗平、同業鮮有出入、至三點光景忽聞印匯放長、更且各方都有售出、波濤突起、而匯票隨之寛濫、四月份英金銀行對做十一便士三一二五、又互做六月日金一兩零四分一二五、浙江進五月英金十一便士四三七五、遂降至九十八兩三四錢、繼因賣户更旺、卒跌至九七兩一錢、大有一蹶不振之勢、陷於疲境、時略加上數錢、爲八兩左右、迨四點三十分收盤復已墜至九十七兩一錢、較前日計跌四兩三錢、</p>
<p>結價抑至十四兩零、查一日間最大價五百兩○○六錢、最小價四百九十七兩一錢、計有三兩五錢迥顧、揭價仍計五百十一兩八錢、計做小十二兩至十三兩、後市揭價竟撳十四兩有餘、登賬後補水九十九兩、下午九十七兩、物品早開九十九兩七錢、午收八兩九錢、下午九兩、收市七兩、</p>

<p>海外電訊印滙如前、横濱及神户市亦平庸至於本埠各滙内部、晨平嗣疲、午後尤頽、乃標金已見墜落、跌進五百兩大關、更陷入四百九十八兩以内、同業供過於求、於是市氣衰落也、華商投機家稍有售出、銀行方而胃口平常、計英滙曾抛出五六萬鎊、茲由安逹·與業·中法·浙江·東亞·</p>

<p>市塲概况、銀錢業夙尙陰歷、當此時間、適逢正繁忙之三月間特殊比期、按理氣勢奇盛、今年改用國歷、例爲四月份、故昨日又值第一次最繁忙之大比期、自改國歷以來、實爲創製、觀其進出之盛、雖不歊上年之甚、然較平時之收解、</p>
<p>大有霄場之隔、職是銀欵需给特與、而洋欵亦因有客路少些銷胃、殆不示弱、二者相并、遂成奇忙之象耳、</p>
<p>釐拆價格、「洋釐」供求方面、各相平均、故對於釐價之開做、大都適中、昨晨爲七錢二分○三毫七忽半、午市爲七錢二分○半釐、與前日早午兩市、依舊相合、毫無頡頑之舉動、「銀拆」則較前日又弱一檔、計早市爲三分、午市二分、較前日早午市各小一分、劃頭仍做白劃、蓋進出雖忙、而頭襯活動、轉覺充裕、是以有此結果、</p>
<p>輔幣市情、江南小洋、晨問稍有買胃、故市價抬高一釐、計爲六錢一分九釐、做出交易四千角、午市交易又淡、無人問津、結果仍跌一釐、與前日同價爲六錢一分八釐、做出交易、亦僅一千五百角、據聞内地略有萬餘角裝去、廣東小洋、</p>
<p>早市爲五錢九分八釐二毫半、午市爲五錢九分八釐三毫七忽半、做出交易早市十六萬五千角午市七萬五千角、銅元則改長一千五百文、計爲三百九十五千五百文、</p>

<h3 id="c205">憂鬱女詩人　百合· <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>虞琰的「湖風」</p>
<p>某日的黃昏、在西門珈琲座上看見某雜誌裏面有「創作月評」、末一段是批评虞琰女士的詩集「湖風」的、</p>
<p>初次在文壇上出現的女詩人虞琰君、在她的「湖風」一集、送給了我們以一種若何的消息呢、是一種憂鬰的湖風、是一種悲澀的情調、她的情緒和她的年齡很不相稱、厭世的悲觀的基調却在她的靑年的心裏成長了、從客觀上看去、她的這種深沉的憂鬰、並不完全是由於實際生活的激發、也多少受了一些悲觀的哲學的影響、</p>
<p>在没有披誦「湖風」之前、在我的意識觀念上、就留着「一位憂鬰女詩人」的印像了、</p>
<p>揭開詩集、在序裏一看見「琰底詩的確太過蕭瑟了」一類的估語、不禁就使我聯想起了李道清的「靑玉案詞」裏的詞句、</p>
<p>如今猜透、春愁離恨、總是詞人分、</p>
<p>記得有人説過、女性是富於感情的動物、而詩人們也是感情豐富的、就可以説是「男性中的女性、」（見北村透谷的「厭世詩人與女性」）細味這話的意味、</p>
<p>那末就可以斷定女性有做詩人的特殊天禀、末始没有理由的吧、但是在反對者説起來、詩是人類苦悶的象徵、中國的女性向來因爲社會組織的關係、生活老虞在依賴的地位、若没有被棄守寡、是不會有甚麽苦悶的、加之不與人類生活中接觸、</p>
<p>所知道的、不過是針線粉脂、所感到的無非是春花秋月衾底枕邊、其窮苦的、有些肉體上的窘困、並没有精神上的痛苦、或者有時有幾個心境靈清的、但爲禮敎家法所束縛、也就一會兒消滅了、所以難得有可觀的文學創作、</p>
<p>虞琰的「湖風」、在文學上的估價暫且不説、現在只隨便寫幾句我私人的讀後感想、</p>
<p>「湖風」裏共收詩三十八首、寫景物的二十二首、抒情思的十四首、雜感小詩二首、在寫景詩中、「一隻破船」最合乎純粹叙事詩的形式、而以「無名之花」爲最有精彩、在抒情詩中、雖則很多借物寄情之作、但也可以窺見作者思想的一斑、</p>
<p>「湖風」的詩句、三分之二是意義消極的字眼、差不多每首裏可以讀見「生的寥寂」、「悲哀的情調」、「受創後的心」、「</p>
<p>杜鵑兒的夜啼」、「無限離愁」、「墓中的骷髏」、「殘枯的黃葉」、「傷心的新月」、「最後的殺滅」·····一類與憂鬰狀態有關係的辭句、據變態心理學者的研究所得、中國女子之體力底弱、精神鬰結者、爲數甚多、而智識階級中之女子爲尤甚、唯其體氣虚弱、精神鬰結、故平時每覺慵懶困倦</p>
<p>、及遇有比較强烈之刺激、即覺不勝·不堪·無奈·無計、甚者且「懨懨」或「病」、而「瘦比黃花」也、故其發爲情感亦多消沉、</p>
<p>愁哀啼哭等字、掩閨閉簾、幾成詞人日常生活中富有意味之活動、（見潘光旦的「</p>
<p>小靑之分析」）以上所論、不過把中國舊時代一般女詩人做一個總觀察後所得的結論、也可以當作「多愁善病」、女詩人們的一張診狀、</p>
<p>「湖風」的作者、有没有如上面所説的精神鬰结、我們因爲不知道「琰底經歷」與「她心版上底刻痕、」所以不敢妄加探測、但在她的幾首抒情詩裏、那些詩句如果都是作者的自白與傾訴、我們可以引舉出虞　女士自供的詩句如下、</p>
<p>在「我願化作靑烟」中、她告訴我們以她的理想與志願、她要脱離有「衰老之鄉」與「痛苦煩惱」的人間世界、化作靑烟、</p>
<p>晏息在山間、</p>
<p>做那雲岫底知已、</p>
<p>作者爲表示她這個志趣、還題了一個「岫雲」的名字、這樣的志趣、是不是激發自作者愛好大自然的天性、還是受了他人悲觀哲學的暗示與影響、我們也無須加以研究、但可以説作者的人生觀是厭世的、再試讀她下面的詩句、</p>
<p>荷花瓣上點點美麗的露珠啊、</p>
<p>人生與你一般的空虚、</p>
<p>雖有時人們會將你讚頌、</p>
<p>你也莫貪那瞬息虚榮、</p>
<p>在陽光熱烈的照到大地時、</p>
<p>會受到莫大的羞辱與譏諷、</p>
<p>丨夏夜、</p>
<p>且喝一杯甜味的紅酒罷、</p>
<p>别求着人們的憐惜、</p>
<p>人們的憐惜啊、</p>
<p>比着那冷笑還可恥、</p>
<p>丨贈ＳＳ女士、</p>
<p>鮮紅熱烈的心、</p>
<p>深陷在這空虚的人生、</p>
<p>都完了啊、</p>
<p>什麽是成功和希望、</p>
<p>什麽是眞情與摰愛、</p>
<p>都葬埋於荒谷、</p>
<p>沉淪於死海、</p>
<p>丨人生的悲歌、</p>
<p>讀着這些詩句、想起了錢杏邨君所説的「厭世的悲觀的基調却在她的靑年的心裏成長了、」覺得很有理由、厭惡人世、原來是一般靑年共通有的常性、而尤其以詩人爲最甚、原來在人類的生涯中、</p>
<p>自從思想萌發以後、大家都希冀眞美與美、而嫌忌醜惡、這是自然的道理、可是對於世界不熟識、對於世界的深奥處不能貫透的人們、初遇見現實世界一切的紛擾與不調和、便感到一切與自已的理想有許多齟齬在智識與經騐相敵視、空想與現實相戰爭的靑年時代、對於人生易起怪訝與厭世之觀念、那是當然的結果、「湖風」作者因了年齡靑輕的關係、而且還没有失去少女時代的純樸思想、對於現實的社會生活、完全隔膜、對於人生自然免不了要抱厭世的觀念了、</p>
<p>一個詩人、對於那實際的人生旣然起了厭惡、對於將來也决不敢預期着多大的希望、於是不得不回想到過去的幻夢、在回憶紀念中去咀嚼橄欖一般的滋味、「湖風」的作者、因此常常謳歌着她過去的童年事情</p>
<p>何處是美滿的夢境、</p>
<p>在這已往的童年時代、</p>
<p>丨人生的悲歌</p>
<p>又怕見</p>
<p>鄰兒們朝着我嬉笑</p>
<p>倚着那些老年人的胸懹</p>
<p>我並不丨</p>
<p>並不厭煩那清音、</p>
<p>嫉妒那兒童們的天眞丨</p>
<p>爲了我的童年難再</p>
<p>丨五月中的我</p>
<p>但是這些並不是作者的眞的苦悶、</p>
<p>也不是她的眞的憂愁、虞琰女士所憂鬰的苦悶的究竟是什麽東西呢、我們可以從這些詩句裏尋出根因、</p>
<p>病、</p>
<p>消沉、</p>
<p>任窗外、</p>
<p>雨打風侵、</p>
<p>慰我有何人、</p>

<p>這心底缺陷、</p>
<p>什</p>
<p>丨夜的呻吟</p>
<p>鄰女的歌聲隠隠</p>
<p>怕是在找知音吧</p>
<p>不然爲何如此幽沉</p>
<p>可是我啊、</p>
<p>還得羨慕你、</p>
<p>你却有這勇氣去找尋、</p>
<p>丨羨慕</p>
<p>人頭重疊裏、</p>
<p>她睜眼四看、</p>
<p>祇覺得眼前一片烏黑的渺茫、</p>
<p>尋不到知音</p>
<p>更看不見同惰、</p>
<p>丨城市中的一個歌者</p>
<p>聰慧賢明的讀者諸位吓、你們現在可都知道了我們的女詩人憂鬰的病源了吧、這個病源、也是一般的詩人所共通染有的、所有一切靑年詩人的謳歌、全有這種憂鬰的潛伏、試看哥德最有名的詩句罷、</p>
<p>誰未曾忍着悲苦呑食麵包、</p>
<p>誰未曾在深夜低泣、</p>
<p>孤坐候來朝、</p>
<p>他不認識你呀你偉大的神力、</p>
<p>這偉大的神力究竟是什麽東西呢、</p>
<p>說來、那就是愛、一個正當靑春時期生理</p>
<p>成熟的男子、誰不對於女性感着飢渴、因爲思慕天之一方的美人、以至於輾轉反側不能成寐、把他的憂思抒爲詩歌、自然很容易博得許多讀者同情的眼涙、同樣地女性當然也要思慕男性、所謂春心勃發而戀愛生戀愛未遂而詩歌成、那是自然的道理、</p>
<p>人類的苦悶與憂鬰、尤其詩人們鬰悶的靈魂、假使抱了深鞏的厭世觀念、那是没有療治的藥品、宗敎的信仰不能克勝他們的厭世、人世的享樂也打破不了他們的消極、只有一件寳貝、可以當作那些純粹理想靑年詩人們的對症良藥、那就是戀愛、</p>
<p>日本北村透谷在「厭世詩人與女性」</p>
<p>裏面、有一節很透澈的議論、</p>
<p>厭世家對於現世没有别的希望、金　　錢利祿固然不是他所希望的、即天　　子的王冠、錢道王的富榮、他也絕不　　希望、所以厭世家與現世的希望是　　冰炭不相容、可是獨有戀愛領有一　　種秘訣、可以深入厭世家們的呻吟　　的胸裏、最奇怪的是、他們在戀愛之　　中却放着好多希望、「情」這種東西　　是不使你有一刻安靜的、只要一走　　進去、心中總是被擾亂着、更何况平　　生最易於激昂的厭世家們、在實現</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>社會裏遭了挫折、而反被戀愛的奇　　異的魔力所戰勝、這時他峯起全身　　心而做了情的奴隸、不也是很顯明　　的道理嗎、</p>
<p>男女相愛之後、才能開始了解社會　　的眞相、到那時就連一個細小的昆　　蟲、也不是孤立的、也不是能離開我　　們可以自動的、在人類相集的社會　　裏、要相依託、相擁抱之後、才能維　　持或建設社會的這種道理、我們非　　登上「相愛」的第一階是不能了解的　　、一個人獨棲的時候、没有完滿了社　　會一份子的要素、兩個人相合了之　　後才算社會的一份子、</p>
<p>男女旣合而爲一、晨曉的空中所動　　着的浮雲、也好像有了臉面、森林中　　老鳥的鳴聲、也好像有了音調、昨日　　的過去、好像是幾十年的往昔、今日　　的現在、好像是能延亙數代的實存、</p>
<p>自從人們得了這種正當的地位之後　　、才能了解對於上帝的義務、對於人　　類的義務、以及先前所認爲爛漫之　　花的道義、减去他的妄想、加重他的　　實想、以做他走入人生的「正午期」</p>
<p>的基礎、</p>
<p>以上所論、可以證明一般有厭世觀念的詩人、他們對於戀愛的追求及飢渴、</p>
<p>比較平常的少男少女更來得激切、這是在他們的文學創作中、常可以發見來證實的、</p>
<p>因爲讀了「湖風」發生了一些感想、</p>
<p>却滑筆聯説到許多不相干的話、對於「湖風」作者及讀者諸位、深覺抱歉、現在應該結束我了話了、</p>
<p>最後、謹掬我的徵忱、希望虞琰女士不要再唱這樣「彷徨之歌」、</p>
<p>那早晚發着熱烈的太陽、</p>
<p>也没有温熱過我的胸口、</p>
<p>愁苦憂鬰、</p>
<p>常盤旋在我的心頭、</p>
<p>少女詩人吓、旋換你的琴絃、更轉你的歌喉、謳唱着歡樂的調子罷、</p>
<p>讓我洗清了文鬰的憂傷、</p>
<p>讓我來長享受你的聖光、</p>
<p>丨偉大仁慈的月　　憂鬰女詩人、我爲你祝福、</p>

Yao Yijia, the Pacification Commissioner of Shanxi, told reporters that he had come to Xuzhou on this trip and would go north with Han and Chen immediately, first to Jining and then to Jinan, to carry out pacification affairs. He has already sent a letter to Fu Zuoyi, urging him to abandon the rebellion and return to allegiance. It is hoped that this can be accomplished.

<p>(Nanjing) Nepal has raised troops to invade Tibet and has advanced to the vicinity of Suiding. The two sides are in a stalemate. According to news received by a certain organization in Beijing from a radio station, the Dalai Lama has sent people to negotiate peace with Nepal several times, but Nepal's demands are excessive, resulting in no results. Nepal is currently continuing to advance its troops, and the situation in the capital Lhasa and its surrounding areas is very urgent. At the same time, the Dalai Lama said that the peace talks have already achieved considerable results and that he is currently negotiating with Nepal to stop military action. The representatives of the Panchen Lama who came to Beijing to request the dispatch of troops as soon as possible have not left Beijing because they have not yet received a satisfactory reply. It is said that the Central Government has not yet obtained detailed information on the truth of the matter and plans to take action after investigating and clarifying the situation.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e8">The British Overseas Trade Development Council <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The United States advocates construction to relieve unemployed workers. Japan reduces wages to relieve the depression of the yarn industry. Britain establishes the Overseas Trade Development Council to reduce unemployed workers. From this, it can be seen that the decline of world commerce can be proven. Commerce declines, and then the supply of goods exceeds demand. When the supply of goods exceeds demand, manufacturing is reduced. Only then are there unemployed workers. Moreover, due to the decline of commerce, goods stagnate or are sold at low prices. As a result, factories cannot make profits, or their profits are very small. Only then is it unavoidable to have a policy of economy and reduce wages. Therefore, the various actions of the United States, Britain, and Japan are all signs of commercial decline.</p>
<p>Merchants' trade is bound to have profits and losses. There will be times of prosperity and times of decline. Therefore, the decline of commerce is anticipated by those engaged in business. However, while the decline of the times is expected by those engaged in business, the current decline of commerce concerns the entire world and cannot be recovered in a short time. Therefore, the United States, Britain, and Japan, which are famous for their commercial warfare, have seen this and must take long-term remedial measures, resolutely not considering it a temporary decline and waiting for it to pass.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, prosperity is bound to decline. Since the rise of industrialized countries, so-called commercial warfare has almost surpassed all kinds of war strategies. Now, although the centipede is dead but not stiff, and the decline of global commerce has already appeared, the strength of so-called industrialized countries will also subside slightly.</p>

<p>The Cigarette and Printing Trade Unions are Dissolved</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Workers of the British American Tobacco Company, due to refusing to resume work,</p>
<p>Had nine workers arrested by the authorities. On the 9th, the workers sent eight representatives to the Party headquarters to petition and put forward five demands. Commissioner Wu Rencang responded and sent Chen Zhongjia to accompany the eight representatives back to the factory to persuade them to resume work first. However, the workers refused to be persuaded and clashed with the police who were maintaining order. More than forty male and female workers were arrested on the spot and sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The cigarette and printing trade unions were immediately dissolved.

<p>Negotiations on Sino-Japanese Legal Rights</p>
<h3 id="e10">Discussions Can Begin After Mamoru Shima Arrives <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) There has been no significant progress in the negotiations on Sino-Japanese legal rights. After China submitted its proposal to Japanese Minister Shigemitsu, the Japanese government has not yet responded. Shigemitsu's meetings with Foreign Minister Wang in the past two days were merely exchanges of views. The date of formal negotiations has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>It is reported that Mamoru Shima, who was specially dispatched by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to assist in the process, will arrive in China in the coming days. Regarding this issue, formal discussions can begin when Mamoru Shima arrives in Shanghai. According to one theory, the Japanese side advocates discussing it after the signing of the tariff agreement. Whether this is true remains to be verified. Shigemitsu and the military attaché of the embassy, 佐重, hosted a banquet for He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Chen Yi, Zhou Yawei, etc., at the Japanese Consulate on the evening of the 10th. Shigemitsu is scheduled to return to Shanghai by plane on the afternoon of the 11th. If it rains,</p>
<p>He will take the early train from Beijing. (10th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 10th: As a result of the Anglo-American-Japanese tripartite naval conference this morning, all issues have been resolved. The second step will be to draft the Three-Power Pact.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th: A spokesman for the British delegation to the naval conference announced this morning that hope for the success of the Five-Power Pact still exists.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th: Discussions among the delegates to the naval conference regarding the Five-Power Pact made little progress today due to the illness of Italian delegate Grandi. The British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary met with the Italian Ambassador and others for a considerable time today. In the evening, British and French representatives also gathered in the Prime Minister's office in the House of Commons. Afterward, a statement was issued saying that the evening meeting had studied the developments in discussions over the past twenty-four hours and that discussions would resume tomorrow. Anglo-American-Japanese experts studying the Japanese government's reservations reached agreement on most points in their meeting today. Two unresolved points remain, which will be discussed tomorrow. The special committee organized by the First Committee to consider the issue of aircraft carriers also met today. It was agreed that the generic term "aircraft carrier" should include the following two types: (1) aircraft carriers with a standard displacement of 10,000 tons or more; (2) other surface warships with a standard displacement of not more than 10,000 tons, whose structure is purely for carrying aircraft and which can enable aircraft to take off and land on them. The aforementioned warships shall not be equipped with guns larger than six inches in caliber. All such warships shall be classified as aircraft carriers. Other ships shall be classified according to their tonnage and armament.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: The issue of converting ship types is a major hurdle in Japan's negotiations with Britain and the United States. A plenary meeting was held at 2:00 PM on the 9th to discuss this. Japanese naval officials feared that Japan's proposals would not be accepted, so they had a tragic determination from the outset. They held meetings and discussions from the evening of the 8th until 2:00 AM on the 9th. Then, the Japanese plenipotentiaries strongly advocated their position for two hours at the plenary meeting. However, Britain and the United States remained firm in their attitude. Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki had no choice but to withdraw the request and acknowledged the replacement tonnage for ships built from 1936 onward, as being 16,000 to 18,000 tons. Thus, the discussion on Japan's reservations, as instructed by the Japanese government, was completed at this point.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, London, 9th: The tripartite plenary meeting convened at 2:30 PM on the 9th to discuss the issue of Japan's proposal to convert light cruisers and destroyers into submarines, lasting for two and a half hours. The attitudes of Britain and the United States remained as firm as those of the expert committee. It is reported that Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki had no choice but to withdraw the request. After the meeting, Mr. Wakatsuki told people that both the British Prime Minister and the U.S. Secretary of State had strong objections to increasing submarines. Although not explicitly stated, it was implied that at a time when the total abolition of submarines was being discussed, reduction might be considered, but increasing them was absolutely opposed. In short, the discussions among the three countries have largely concluded at this point. The reservation regarding the need for replacement of the "Furutaka"-class was requested for understanding at the meeting on the 8th. However, since replacing 10,000 tons would affect the agreed tonnage, the prospects seem difficult.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th: The "Daily Express" claims that the Five-Power Pact is hopeless due to the Franco-Italian deadlock. The Three-Power Pact could not be concluded before Easter, so the U.S. delegates have canceled their arrangements to return to the U.S. by ship on April 22nd.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Part of the Kanebo Workers Go on Strike <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Domei News Agency, Osaka, 10th: The proletarian factions' united political struggle against Kanebo's wage cuts is unlikely to be unified due to the Social Democratic Party's reluctance. However, the economic struggle is expanding nationwide. The Dai Nippon Seigi-dan, which has 150,000 members nationwide, recently issued an opinion stating that wage cuts should be withdrawn, that dividends should be reduced for this period to balance income and expenditure, and that wage cuts should only be considered if that fails.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Osaka, 10th: About 30% of the male workers at the Kanebo Sumida factory were idle yesterday due to the wage cut issue. The female workers were relatively calm. At the Yodogawa factory, factory staff and employees argued inside the factory yesterday morning. Although police temporarily intervened to restore calm, the excited workers began a strike from the afternoon. More than 600 people left the factory and joined members of the Osaka Textile Labor Union in the town for a large demonstration. Led by the union chairman, they pretended to be changing shifts and broke into the factory, persuading more than 300 night shift workers, both male and female, to leave the factory and retreat to the labor union headquarters. The night shift workers who remained in the factory also began to be idle. Vice President Tsuda, upon hearing the news, rushed from Kobe and summoned the male and female workers to give a speech, but to no avail. The more than 800 people who had been agitated cheered and left the factory, and nothing could stop them.</p>
<p>Vice President Tsuda's attitude was quite firm, and he declared that he would stand firm against the employees' petition. However, the employees of the Yodogawa factory, having rejected his demand to withdraw the wage cut, officially began a strike from noon today. The Nakatsu and Shigeno factories are also showing signs of unrest, and the situation threatens to worsen.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Osaka, 10th: Finance Minister Inoue, regarding the Kanebo wage cut issue, told people that he failed at wage cuts himself, so he is not qualified to speak. However, he admires Sanji Muto's determination that the cause of the Kanebo wage cuts was the result of lifting the gold embargo. It is ridiculous to attribute the cause of the wage cuts to the poor timing or method of lifting the embargo, or to industrial rationalization. Such propaganda confuses truth and falsehood. If Kanebo is indeed in dire straits, as Mr. Muto said, it is due to the impact of the global drop in cotton and silver prices. Moreover, whether it is truly in dire straits is unknown to him. He also believes that the recent increase in tariffs by India is also a factor in prompting the authorities to implement wage cuts.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: Employees of the Kanebo Sumida factory requested the withdrawal of the wage cut plan. The factory manager replied that the wage cut plan was outside of his authority and he could not answer immediately. However, within his authority, he would reduce the prices of rice, other food, medical expenses, and housing expenses sold in the purchasing department to seek ways to supplement the poor. The employees were not satisfied and declared that they must withdraw the wage cut plan no matter what. If there was no answer by the night of the 9th, they would take decisive action.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: Kishiwada Spinning Mill had already cut wages by 5% in March. Upon receiving news of Kanebo's wage cuts, it announced another 5% cut yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e57">German Government and Various Parties Seek Compromise <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Berlin, 9th: After the German Parliament's Finance Committee rejected the new tax rates on beer, tobacco, and soda, the government's original planned sources of revenue will be reduced by a quarter.</p>
<p>Therefore, Parliament is on the verge of being dissolved. However, neither the Cabinet nor the various parties have an urgent desire to dissolve Parliament. Therefore, consultations were held throughout today in hopes of reaching a compromise. It has been proposed that the Bavarian People's Party's demands be accommodated by reducing the beer tax and increasing the business tax on large department stores and certain miscellaneous taxes to supplement the revenue. However, business circles are still extremely dissatisfied with the government's agricultural plan. Today, its official newspaper published a declaration by the German Industrial Union strongly opposing the government's agricultural plan, which is also a hurdle.</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Berlin, 9th: The government and various parties resumed consultations from the afternoon until late at night and finally reached a compromise. It is proposed to reduce the newly added tax rate on beer from the originally planned 75% to 50%, hoping that this will gain the consent of the Bavarian People's Party. The party will express its opinion tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>If this measure still fails to satisfy them, there will be no other way but to dissolve Parliament.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 9th: Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden's wife hosted a luncheon yesterday at Downing Street, inviting important figures from the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. Liberal leaders George and Samuel were also among them. Mrs. Snowden's invitation has occurred twice in the past half-month, leading to talk of a new alliance between the Liberal Party and the Socialist Party. However, according to reliable news today, the speeches at the luncheon did not mention any future political alliance between the two parties. The discussion focused solely on how to conduct non-partisan counter-propaganda against those who are engaged in protectionist tariffs. Anyone in the Conservative Party who advocates free trade will also be invited to join a large-scale movement. Labor Party figures Grenfell and Nathan have been recommended as conveners of the steering committee. Grenfell stated today that Snowden and George may appear together on the same platform advocating free trade.</p>

<p>German Sensational Maritime Case</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Hamburg, 9th: The trial began today of a German maritime case that is sensational in the history of German justice. It is alleged that the former 1,000-ton steamer "Falk" carried cargo from a Polish port to Venezuela. While sailing in the ocean, the ship's captain, Berled, suddenly put on the uniform of a Venezuelan admiral and raised the Venezuelan flag on the ship, forcing all German crew members to swear allegiance to the Venezuelan revolutionary leader Delgado on board. The crew members had no choice but to obey the shipowner's orders according to regulations and sailed into Venezuelan territorial waters. The entire army was defeated, Delgado was killed, and the ship was confiscated by the British. Therefore, the shipowner, Ulamaski, and the ship's captain, Berled, are accused of kidnapping, coercion, forced detention, and forced labor.</p>
<p>Representatives from the Foreign Office and consuls from various countries were present in court to observe the trial.</p>

<p>From Xuzhou, addressed to all newspapers: Our division has been ordered to repeatedly suppress Zhang Gui, Sanhe Mamuji, and recently, the bandits in Hanzhuang. The officers and soldiers who died in battle fought bravely and selflessly, as if they were still alive even in death. However, the countryside is quiet and desolate; who can return the first to the grave? The grass is lush and green, but one can distinguish the blood of 宏.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, we are deeply saddened. It is now decided to hold a memorial service on the 20th of this month at the Xuzhou military base. All comrades-in-arms share this sorrow. We hope to add to the revolutionary war history and comfort the spirits of the martyrs. We respectfully inform you, hoping for your attention. Respectfully, The Preparatory Committee for the Memorial Service for the Fallen Soldiers of the 3rd Division of the National Revolutionary Army.</p>

<p>The Central Executive Committee will hold its 85th Standing Committee meeting at 8:00 AM this morning (the 10th). Attendees: Hu Hanmin, Tan Yankai, Chen Guofu, Sun Ke. Observers: Lin Sen, Zhang Daofan, Liu Jiwen, Jiao Yitang, Gu Yingfen, Chen Yaoyuan, Chen Lifu, Liu Luyin, Zhu Peide, Kedi Nasu, Chen Zhenying, Fang Jue, Li Wenfan, Wang Zhengting, Shao Yuanchong, He Yingqin. Chairman: Hu Hanmin. Resolutions are as follows: (1) It was resolved that Yan Xishan had been expelled from the Party and that all his original positions as member of the Political Conference and member of the National Government, etc., should be revoked. (2) It was resolved to designate Zhu Yingpeng, Xiong Shihui, Wang Yansong, Deng Tongwei, and Chen Xizeng as Supervisory Committee members of Shanghai Special Municipality, and Jiang Huaisu and Wu Xiu as alternate Supervisory Committee members.</p>
<p>(3) It was resolved to designate Hu Bohan, Min Shiying, Zhang Da, Liu Menghang, Tang Guomin, Song Si, Duan Linjiao, Miao Jiaqi, and Fang Tian as executive members of the Special Party Department of the Wuhan Branch of the Central Military Academy, and Wang Shenmin, Cai Zhengzhong, Zhang Shixi, Wang Qiba, and Qian Chong as alternate executive members. (4) The Central Supervisory Committee sent a letter approving the transfer of the Nanyang British General Branch's submission regarding Zhou Yongzhong, an accountant of the Second District Branch of the Selangor Branch, who embezzled public funds during his tenure in 1927, disappeared after handing over his duties, and was not registered during the general registration. It was requested that he be permanently expelled from the Party and that the National Government issue an arrest warrant. After review, since the member was not registered and was therefore not a Party member, it was proposed at the 18th Standing Committee meeting to notify all levels of the Party that Zhou Yongzhong would never be allowed to join the Party. A copy of the original submission was sent for review and action. The resolution was approved. (5) The Central Supervisory Committee sent nine cases of Party members to be punished, including three who were permanently expelled from the Party: Chen Wuzhen, Hu Bosun (Shaoxing, Zhejiang), Zhao Gang (Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway); four who were expelled from the Party: Wu Guxu (Tianjin), Feng Changfu, Feng Shiming (Guangzhou), Wu Zhongfan (Hubei); and one who was suspended from the Party for one year: Wu Dian'an.

<p>The Central Propaganda Department held a meeting for journalists at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th in the Central Second Conference Room. More than 20 journalists from various newspapers attended. Chairman Zhang Tingxiu reported as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Recent situation in the North: Regarding Party affairs, because Chen Gongbo, Wang Faqin, and Xie Chi and Zou Lu were disputing the issue of Party leadership, they not only could not cooperate, but the rift was widening. Chen, Wang, and others had Feng as their background, while Zou and Xie had Yan as their background. Because of the different backgrounds, it was even more difficult to reconcile, so a joint declaration was ultimately difficult to issue. As for other small organizations within the Party, occupying Party headquarters and institutions was rampant, with all sorts of strange occurrences. Their failure was inevitable. (2) Yan's desire for the Party was nothing more than a pretense. Seeing the Party affairs in such disarray, he wanted to abandon the Party and invite the Anfu Research Group and other factions to take the stage. For financial reasons, he planned to invite Liang Shiyi to be his financial backer. Therefore, members of the Anfu faction, such as Zhang Shizhao, are setting up institutions in Tianjin to carry out their new political agenda. (3) Regarding the Northeast, due to its diplomatic background and local background, it could not but support the Central Government. Moreover, Zhang Xueliang is a promising young man, and all his actions are very proper. His recent talks with Wu Tiecheng were all open and aboveboard. He also held a meritorious service ceremony the other day. How his attitude is, is even clearer. (4) Regarding newspapers, recent statistics show that they are divided into two parts. One is overseas opinion. Our Party's power accounts for more than 80%, while the Imperial Party, the Zhi Gong Tang, the Communist Party, etc., account for less than 20%. The second is domestic opinion, with the Yangtze River basin south to the Pearl River basin being the most developed, but there are those who occasionally propagate for the Communist Party. The press should pay attention to this point. What is most regrettable is that most of the newspapers in the Yellow River basin adapt to the environment and have no consistent stance. The newspapers in the Northeast are more promising. In addition, regarding military affairs, because of the confidential nature of military relations, they should be published with caution, and so on. After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>National Government Order to the Executive Yuan</p>
<h3 id="e73">Prohibition of Arbitrary Tax Increases in Provinces <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The National Government yesterday instructed the Executive Yuan, stating that the Ministries of Finance and Industry and Commerce have jointly submitted a report stating, "We earnestly request a nationwide order to be issued to prevent local areas from arbitrarily increasing taxes and levies, in order to maintain financial stability and protect industry and commerce."</p>
<p>We believe that the key to realizing the principles of the People's Livelihood is to prioritize the development of domestic industry and commerce. The key to reorganizing national finances is to first unify revenue and expenditure procedures. In order to reorganize finances and protect the people's livelihood, the central government, on November 20th of the 17th year, issued an order dividing national and local revenue, clearly stipulating that likin and all similar taxes on transit similar to likin, would be centrally controlled, and strictly prohibiting local surcharges. Furthermore, on January 17th of this year, the government issued another clear order that all likin and similar taxes across the country would be abolished starting from October 10th. This was intended to establish standardized collection methods, so that finances could be reorganized, and to eliminate excessive and miscellaneous taxes, so that there would be hope for the development of industry and commerce. Once industry and commerce thrive,</p>
<p>the tax base will be robust, financial resources will be abundant, government affairs will be managed effectively, and the national economy and people's livelihood will both benefit. However, since the 17th year and thereafter, although orders have been issued, various localities have not complied and have arbitrarily imposed surcharges, which are prevalent everywhere.</p>
<p>The onerousness of their names and the multiplicity of checkpoints cause industry and commerce to be hampered by extortion and obstruction, and finance to be in a state of confusion and divergence.</p>
<p>If this is not promptly eliminated, how can the central government's policies of managing finances and enriching the people be realized? The ministries in charge of industry, commerce, and finance should uphold the central government's intentions, and earnestly comply with the plans to alleviate the hardships of industry and commerce and reorganize finances. Previously, business associations, merchants, and factories in various provinces, counties, and cities had submitted requests to eliminate excessive and miscellaneous taxes to alleviate their difficulties, such as the Joint Association of Ramie Fabric Traders from Sichuan and Shanxi in Shanghai.</p>
<p>For each piece of ramie fabric with a value of around thirty-seven yuan, the journey from Rongchang, Sichuan, to Chongqing, is only three hundred li, but the taxes paid, excluding regular taxes, include as many as fifteen different miscellaneous taxes. For example, nine cents for the postal pavilion protection fee, 27.5 cents for the Jin Yong Lu protection fee, 7.5 cents for the Jin Yong Lu group fee, 10 cents for the Da'an Chang stamp tax, 10 cents for the Ma Fang Bridge mountain defense fee, 24 cents for the Xiao Ma Fang Bridge mountain defense fee, 8 cents for the Lai Feng Post protection stamp fee, 12.5 cents for the Yu Bei protection fee, 12.5 cents for the Yu Bei river defense fee, 8.125 cents for the Yu Bei sub-collection fee, 10 cents for the Yu Bei stamp fee,</p>
<p>30 cents for the Chongqing unified tax, 12 cents for the Chongqing unified tax surcharge,</p>
<p>7.25 cents for the Chongqing protection fee, and 2.4 cents for the Chongqing business group fee, totaling more than 1.9 yuan. Upon entering Yichang, an additional 28.9 cents for the levee construction fee is added, bringing the total to more than 2.196 yuan. If the regular taxes to be paid are added, the tax rate, based on the principal, reaches 8 to 9 percent.</p>
<p>This is only the case for the journey from Rongchang to Yichang, which is already so burdensome. Furthermore, according to a report from the Danhua Match Company forwarded by the Beijing Municipal Government, the unified tax form for machine-made imitation foreign goods originated in the late Qing Dynasty and clearly stated that no further taxes would be levied after the regular tax was paid. Since the establishment of the Republic of China,</p>
<p>this practice has been continued and regarded as the primary policy to benefit industry. In recent years, each province and region has acted independently, and the unified tax form has lost its effectiveness.</p>
<p>In the summer of the 18th year, the factory association of this city submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to maintain the unified tax system. The Ministry approved the request and ordered compliance, but the heavy taxation in various provinces and regions remains the same as before. Taking the match industry as an example, each small package of 2,400 small boxes weighs less than 35 catties and costs less than six yuan to produce on average. When transported to Suiyuan, in addition to the unified tax, the Xizhimen Railway Station in Beijing charges 10 cents for the grain and cargo unified tax, Zhangjiakou charges 36.4 cents for the Da You tax, 22 cents for the bandit suppression tax, Gui Sui charges 37.8 cents for the cargo tax, and the Sai Bei entrance and exit tax is 4.48 cents each. Suiyuan charges 7.57 cents for the Qing Yuan Bureau tax, totaling 1.2273 yuan in double taxation. When transported to Henan, in addition to the unified tax, the Xibianmen Railway Station in Beijing charges 10 cents for the Hebei tax, and Shijiazhuang charges 27.55 cents for the unified tax, totaling 37.55 cents in double taxation. Local landing fees, military contributions, surcharges, and station fees collected with freight are not included. This obstructs industry, the people's livelihood, and government orders deeply and significantly. Therefore, we request that the government forward the situation to the central government, promptly and strictly maintain the unified tax system, and ensure tangible benefits. The departments have carefully reviewed the taxes paid by the company and found that the tax rate, including the unified tax, reaches 22 to 23 percent for goods transported to Suiyuan and 8 to 9 percent for goods transported to Henan. In addition, according to investigations by the departments, transporting porcelain from Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, to Beijing costs no more than 30 yuan per load. In addition to the one yuan of regular tax paid in Jingdezhen, another 20 cents has recently been added. Along the way, taxes must be paid in various places such as Hukou, Huayang, Wuhu, Dasheng Pass, and Sancha River, totaling about 1.23 yuan. If the regular tax and its surcharges are combined, the tax rate also reaches 8 to 9 percent.</p>
<p>In summary, the tax burden in the inland provinces</p>
<p>is unparalleled. Although the specific tax burden varies for other factories and businesses due to different sales markets, one example can represent the rest. It is no wonder that domestic industry and commerce are difficult to revitalize, and finance is difficult to unify. The reason for this is that</p>
<p>local areas have failed to comply with government orders and have arbitrarily imposed surcharges. In order to realize the central government's policies of managing finances and enriching the people, we dare to jointly submit this report to the government, earnestly requesting that the order to abolish likin issued on January 17th of this year be promoted and expanded throughout the country. According to the central government's decision, all goods and tax revenues have been designated as state-owned. Regardless of whether the central government has levied taxes or not, each province and city must not arbitrarily collect taxes or increase surcharges to further burden the people.</p>
<p>During the period before the actual abolition of likin, we also earnestly request that the provincial and municipal governments and relevant departments devise methods to prohibit local establishment of checkpoints, restrict surcharges, and abolish excessive taxes that violate departmental regulations, and report back for review and enforcement.</p>
<p>in order to eliminate abuses and ensure implementation. In addition to jointly submitting another document to the Executive Yuan, earnestly requesting review and enforcement, we hereby submit this document to your office for review, and we humbly request approval for implementation, etc. This should be approved. In addition to the instructions, the Executive Yuan is hereby ordered to immediately instruct compliance and report back as necessary.</p>

<p>Capture of Zhangping and Other Counties</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Telegraphs to Beijing for Assistance</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the transfer of Liu Heding's division and the departure of Jin Handing's division, the twenty counties in the Tingzhou, Zhangzhou, and Longyan prefectures of western Fujian have been left with only Zhang Zhenyi's army stationed for defense. However, Zhang's army also dispatched a regiment to Chaozhou and Shantou, leaving the military force weak and the defenses empty. Therefore, the communists seized the opportunity to rise again.</p>
<p>They established the Western Fujian Soviet Government in the Ninth Middle School in Longyan County, appointed a person named Kui Zihui as chairman, gathered a crowd of five to six thousand bandits, and captured the counties of Zhangping, Hua'an, Shanghang, Yongding, Liancheng, Nan'an, and Pinghe. They are now divided into two routes, one advancing from Liancheng and Shanghang to Tingzhou, seeking to enter northern Fujian, and the other advancing from Nan'an and Zhangping to Zhangzhou, seeking to enter southern Fujian. For a time, half of the downstream region was shaken. The provincial government has been receiving urgent telegrams from various counties requesting assistance every day, and it is almost impossible to cope with them. Currently, only</p>
<p>Zhang Zhen's division has been ordered to defend Zhangzhou and suppress the bandits in Zhangping and Nan'an, and Lu Xingbang's division has been ordered to defend Tingzhou and suppress the bandits in Liancheng and Shanghang. At the same time, another telegram has been sent to the National Government to request instructions on how to proceed. Yesterday, according to a telegram from Division Commander Zhang,</p>
<p>Zhangzhou has declared a state of special martial law, and the local area is still peaceful and can be secured. Division Commander Lu also telegraphed that he had ordered Huang Qingcai and Lu Xinming's regiments to defend Tingzhou. However, due to the lack of</p>
<p>troops in the captured counties, it is difficult to recover them for the time being. During the communist occupation, they implemented their communist policies, forcing young men and women to serve as Red Guards and propagandists, evenly distributing land, burning deeds, confiscating capital, and destroying production, devastating the social and economic foundations. This is truly heartbreaking. The provincial party committee also believes that if they do not plan to eliminate them as soon as possible, it will inevitably affect the overall situation. Therefore, they sent separate telegrams to the General Headquarters and the Ministry of Military Affairs, stating</p>
<p>"Western Fujian has suffered from communist disaster for more than a year. Since the provincial changes, the troops suppressing the communists have been transferred to distant locations one after another, causing the communist bandits to spread and the overall situation to become critical. We humbly request that you quickly send a strong force to Fujian day and night,</p>
<p>cooperate in suppressing them, so that they can be eliminated as soon as possible," etc. It is unknown how the General Headquarters will handle this telegram. (April 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Suiyuan Implements Spring Planting Subsidies <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Disaster Relief Committee Stipulates Loan Measures</p>
<p>Suiyuan Correspondence: The Suiyuan Provincial Disaster Relief Committee, due to the spring planting seeds,</p>
<p>purchased them properly in Xuanhua, Datong, and other places. Due to the lack of vehicles on the Ping Sui Railway, they could not be transported back. It was proposed that 50,000 yuan of the funds originally intended for purchasing seeds be loaned to disaster-stricken households in various counties to arrange for their own transportation to avoid delaying the farming season. Later, it was increased by 50,000 yuan, and now it has been increased by another 52,000 yuan. Together with the seeds purchased a few days ago that will be transported soon, more than 3,000 shih of Millet and 100 shih of Grain will be allocated and loaned together. In total, this loan of grain and funds, excluding the counties of Wuyuan and Linhe, where the disaster situation is very light and will not be distributed, will be distributed to more than 186,000 yuan in the 15 counties under the jurisdiction of Guisui. The Disaster Relief Committee's deposit, excluding those designated for labor relief in various counties, is almost entirely allocated for this loan. It is said that the standards for loans have been assigned to the county magistrates to accurately investigate the disaster-stricken conditions of the households</p>
<p>and determine the amount of the loan. It should not be like</p>
<p>the past, where it was distributed evenly among various districts and villages. However, in order to conform to the original intention of subsidizing seeds</p>
<p>and ensure repayment, it is still limited to households with land. The loan measures set by the committee are disclosed below:</p>
<p>(Article 1) This committee has stipulated measures for the purpose of subsidizing autumn planting as a criterion for lending grain and funds. (Article 2) The loan amount of this committee is 152,000 yuan, and the loan amount of grain is the amount of Millet and Grain received in the five counties of Linhe. (3,284</p>
<p>Shih of millet, 100 Shih of grain) (Article 3) The millet in the previous article is priced at 11 yuan per shih, and the grain is priced at 10 yuan per shih, as the standard for future repayment. (Article 4)</p>
<p>The grain and funds loaned by this committee should be repaid in full in the form of funds after autumn. (Article 5) The millet loaned by this committee should be allocated to counties suitable for planting, and counties that are not suitable should be loaned with funds. (Article 6) The grain and funds loaned by this committee should be allocated according to the disaster situation in each county, and the amount to be received is as follows: 25,900 yuan for Guisui County, 10,500 yuan for Tuo County, 16,000 yuan for Sa County, 15,000 yuan for Wuchuan County, 5,200 yuan for Helin County, 10,000 yuan for Baotou County, 9,000 yuan for Guyang County, 2,600 yuan for Dongsheng County, 22,000 yuan for Fengzhen County, 26,000 yuan for Jining County, 13,500 yuan for Liangcheng County, 10,000 yuan for Taolin County, 15,800 yuan for Xinghe County, 3,100 yuan for Dashetai Set-up Bureau, and 2,000 yuan for Qingshuihe County. The above 15 counties and bureaus total</p>
<p>186,600 yuan. (Article 7) The county magistrates of each county are fully responsible for the loan and collection of funds by this committee. (Article 8) After receiving the loan, the county magistrates should give priority to allocating it to the districts and villages under their jurisdiction that are most severely affected by the disaster, but they are not allowed to lend it to households without land in order to comply with the purpose of subsidizing autumn planting. (Article 9)</p>
<p>The village heads and deputy heads of each district and village should be fully responsible for the loan and collection of funds. (Article 10) The amount of grain and funds borrowed by local households should be limited to the needs of two qing of land to prevent the abuse of monopoly by large households.</p>
<p>(Article 11) The amount of grain and funds borrowed by local households should be mortgaged with a contract for immovable property that is three times the amount of the loan, but it is also the same when there are other equivalent guarantees. (Article 12) The grain and funds borrowed by local households should be converted into cash by themselves after autumn and handed over to the county magistrate by the village heads and deputy heads for collection, but it must not be later than the Beginning of Winter Festival. (Article 13) After receiving the funds in the previous article, the county magistrates should submit them to the committee in batches for verification and collection. (Article 14)</p>
<p>The county magistrates should be responsible for supervising the repayment of loans by local households. (Article 15) Local households that fail to repay the loans on time shall be subject to a late payment fee of 10 percent, but it shall not be later than the Winter Solstice Festival. (Article 16) If local households fail to repay the loans by the Winter Solstice Festival, the mortgaged property shall be auctioned off or other guarantees shall be enforced. (Article 17) The county magistrates who fail to handle this case effectively shall be punished by the Provincial Government upon request by the Committee. (</p>
<p>Article 18) These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval by the Congress.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Guangdong Province Sends Troops to Northern Guangdong to Suppress Communists <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Counties such as Nanxiong and Shixing are Captured by Zhu De and Peng Dehuai Successively</p>
<p>The Authorities Send Six Regiments of Troops to Encircle and Suppress the Communists in Northeastern Guangdong</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the communist bandits in the Gan border ravaged more than ten counties in southern Jiangxi, Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, Liu Guangxia</p>
<p>were divided into three groups to disturb northern Guangdong after the Jiangxi army went south to suppress them. Initially, due to the emptiness of the defense army in southern Jiangxi, the communist bandits fled south in two groups. Liu Guangxia's group fled to Changning in eastern Jiangxi, (that is, Xunwu). On the 24th of last month, Liu led Gu Bai, Zhong Ximiao, and others to capture Chengjiang Market near Xunwu. Xie Jiayou, the head of the Xunwu militia, led his troops to meet them. Xunwu was in extreme danger, so they telegraphed to the Guangdong border defense army for assistance. Mao Weishou, the commander of the 8th Brigade stationed in the Dongjiang area, heard the news and immediately dispatched the 4th Company to Pingyuan and sent Battalion Commander Feng to lead his troops and a machine gun platoon to Xunwu to assist the militia in suppressing them. Finally, Liu's group of communist bandits was defeated.</p>
<p>More than thirty red flags were captured, and hundreds of people were captured. Liu Guangxia was killed and his head was cut off. As a result, the communist bandits who fled to eastern Jiangxi</p>
<p>were greatly diminished. Although this group was pacified, Zhu De and Peng Dehuai's two groups suddenly became rampant in the northern Guangdong area. On the 28th of last month, after the communist bandits Zhu De and Mao Zedong captured Nankang, Nanxiong on the Guangdong border was in great danger. The business community telegraphed the province to stop shipping goods, and merchants migrated.</p>
<p>The county soldiers and guards gathered on the border for defense, and at the same time, they asked the province for assistance. The communist bandits saw that the defense army was weak and divided into two groups to attack northern Guangdong.</p>
<p>Zhu De and Mao Zedong's group attacked Renhua, and Peng Dehuai and Zhu Quan's group attacked Nanxiong. The Nanxiong defense army held out against the communist bandits near Gengling for three days. As a result, because the bandit forces were huge and the provincial army could not arrive in time, Nanxiong fell on the 1st of this month. Zhu De and Mao Zedong's group also occupied the Changjiang Fuxi area of western Nanxiong. Since the above-mentioned areas have fallen to the bandits, Shixing is only ninety-five li away from Nanxiong and has no defenses. At that time, only two battalions of the provincial army's Wu regiment had arrived. Shixing County Chief Zhou urgently recruited troops, and the newly arrived two battalions were stationed outside the city. After occupying Nanxiong City on the 1st,</p>
<p>the communist bandits advanced south day and night, directly under the jurisdiction of the Gushi Ma Shi Mayor. The Shixing County Chief took the archives and seals to the province on the 2nd, and the personnel of various agencies and party headquarters also fled to Shaoguan for temporary refuge. On the evening of the 2nd, Zhu De and Peng Dehuai forced the city of Shixing, and the defense army could not resist. Shixing fell to the bandits on the morning of the 3rd. After Shixing was lost, Renhua was also undefended.</p>
<p>Because Zhu De's group went down along Fuxi, the county soldiers could not resist.</p>
<p>After receiving the police reports from Renhua and Shixing, the provincial authorities urgently transferred troops to Shao, heading for the blockade. Peng Linsheng's Fifth-ninth Division Training Regiment and Wu Wenxian's Sixty-third Division Training Regiment (</p>
<p>The first and second battalions of Wu's unit had already joined the Shaoguan sand team of Li Shaoqin and departed for Shixing a few days ago, and now the third battalion of He Ding's unit is leaving under the personal leadership of Wu), Liang Gongfu's Da Wu Battalion, Yi Wenwei's 9th Gendarmerie Team, and a machine gun platoon, departed from the province at 9:00 a.m. on the 3rd by Guangdong-Han Railway. Huang Hangnan's Fifth-ninth Division Supplementary Regiment and Zeng Youren's Third Independent Regiment stationed in Wu, returned to the province from Wu on the 3rd to concentrate and transferred to the northern Guangdong to cooperate in suppressing the bandits. In addition, the provincial government telegraphed Mao Weishou's 8th Brigade in Dongjiang Meixian to leave Xunwu along the Ganbian Anyuan and come out of Longnan to intercept the rear of the Nanxiong Shixing communist bandits. It was found that there were only two to three thousand people in Zhu De and Peng Dehuai's two groups, and it should not be difficult to annihilate them with one drumbeat if the Guangdong province sends six regiments of troops to northern Guangdong to encircle them.

<h3 id="e77">Guangdong Province Plans to Abolish Customs Tonnage Dues Office <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Meeting Has Passed, and Will Be Submitted to the Central Government for Approval</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The management of Chinese and foreign steamships sailing in our country's ports or inland has always been handled by the Customs Tonnage Dues Office, which actually damages our country's sovereignty, industrial and commercial navigation, as well as national defense and economy.</p>
<p>Deng Yanhua, Director of the Department of Construction, recently proposed to the Provincial Government to forward a request to the National Government to completely abolish the existing Tonnage Dues Office and have the Department consider establishing a Port Affairs Bureau or Shipping Bureau for temporary management, or to merge the Navigation Affairs Bureau to unify authority. The proposal has been resolved by the Provincial Government's 60th meeting to be handled as proposed. The original proposal of Deng is recorded as follows: 1. The management of Chinese and foreign steamships sailing in our country's ports or inland is handled by the Customs Tonnage Dues Office. The buoys, lighthouses, beacons, etc., set up in each port must also be built by the consul in conjunction with the local officials, so that sovereignty is controlled by foreigners, and the national system is lost. Industrial and commercial navigation is restricted, and national defense and economy are also affected. All kinds of disadvantages can be said by everyone. Moreover, since it concerns internal affairs, how can foreigners overstep their authority? Therefore, Qingdao and Shanghai have already prepared to take them back. Guangdong, as the source of the revolution, can it be allowed to feel at ease? Dare to express my humble opinion and elaborate on it. 1. The reasons for taking them back.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Customs Tonnage Dues Office began in the tenth year of Guangxu.</p>
<p>It was realized in the twenty-fourth year of Guangxu. At that time, there were no navigation affairs agencies in the provinces. Robert Hart, the Inspector General of Customs, said that the number of Chinese and foreign small steamships sailing was increasing day by day, and a special chapter on inland ports should be promulgated for management. He made this statement to the Qing court, and the Qing emperor was weak and hastily approved his request, so it has been followed to this day. Today, the situation is different, and it is no longer what it used to be. Navigation affairs bureaus have been set up almost everywhere. If the Tonnage Dues Office is not abolished, the authority of navigation affairs cannot be unified. This is the first point of why it should be taken back and managed. Moreover, our country's property, our country's ships, or foreign</p>
<p>ships, sailing in our country, our country cannot manage them, and the authority is taken from others, which is unheard of in other countries in the world. What is more unfair? Currently, we are actively proceeding with the abolition of unequal treaties. If we abandon the Tonnage Dues Office and ignore it, how can we protect sovereignty and exalt the national system? This is the second point of why it should be taken back and managed. Moreover, port bays and waterways are related to national defense. All independent countries strictly prohibit foreigners from surveying and photographing their territories, and allow them freedom. Where is national defense placed? This is the third point of why it should be taken back and managed. The Tonnage Dues Office is run by foreign officials, who have territorial prejudices. They often make things difficult for Chinese ships, but they are lenient to foreign ships. Chinese merchants feel the difficulty of operating Chinese ships and the ease of operating foreign ships. Therefore, they often transform Chinese ships into foreign ships, and the amount of money paid to foreign countries every year is unknown. The economy has been invaded. Moreover, with the number of foreign ships increasing and the number of Chinese ships decreasing, navigation is declining, and industry and commerce cannot be revitalized. This is the fourth point of why it should be taken back and managed. The Customs is managed by foreigners because it is related to indemnities and debts, but the Tonnage Dues Office manages ships, which is not related to indemnities, and is actually different from the Customs. Abolition is very easy.</p>
<p>This is the fifth point of why it should be taken back. The establishment of buoys, lighthouses, beacons, etc., in commercial ports is mentioned in the Sino-British Treaty of Xianfeng Eight Years.</p>
<p>That is the beginning of the Tonnage Dues Office managing navigational marks. However, other infringed powers, regardless of which treaty, have no explicit provisions. It is actually due to the gradual encroachment and control of the Inspector General of Customs.</p>
<p>Even though the Regulations on Chinese and Foreign Steamships Sailing in Inland Ports were approved by the Qing court, it was a matter of internal affairs. How can it not be abolished by the central government? This is the sixth point of why it should be taken back and managed. In view of the above six reasons, it can be seen that it is urgent to take back navigation rights and manage them ourselves. Currently, it has been found that in Shanghai and Qingdao, the original Tonnage Dues Office has been abolished and replaced by the Port Affairs Bureau. Guangdong Province, as the hub of trade in the South China Sea, should follow the example and do the same. It is proposed that your office forward the request to the National Government to completely abolish the existing Tonnage Dues Office, and at the same time, the Office will consider establishing a Port Affairs Bureau or Shipping Bureau for temporary management, or merging the Navigation Affairs Bureau to unify authority. Whether it is appropriate or not, I respectfully request a public decision. (April 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Jiangxi Province Extends Deadline for Three Roads to be Completed <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Recent Situation of Construction on the Three Lines Connecting Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Anhui</p>
<p>The Department Orders the Highway Administration to Speed Up Construction</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The construction of the three roads in Jiangxi Province, namely Jiangxi-Zhejiang, Jiangxi-Guangdong, and Jiangxi-Anhui (Jinghu Section), was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of March this year. Later, due to the disturbances of the communist bandits and the difficulty in raising funds, the Director of the Highway Administration, Liu, specifically reported the progress of each road to the Department of Construction.</p>
<p>He requested that troops be sent to suppress the bandits so that he could engage in construction, and he also requested permission to extend the completion deadline. It is said that Director Zhang specially ordered him to extend the deadline to the end of June.</p>
<p>To complete all the projects to facilitate transportation. The recent situation of the construction of the three roads is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangxi-Guangdong Road: The roadbed between Zhangshu and Xingan and within the territory of Ji'an is being stepped up. It happened that a bandit alarm occurred in Xiajiang, a neighboring county, and Xingan was in danger. The road construction workers fled back one after another. When the bandit forces were slightly reduced in December last year,</p>
<p>When work was resumed, the weather was cold and there was rain and snow,</p>
<p>The progress of the road work was extremely slow. As for the section between Xiajiang and Jishui, the communists have been besieging for years, and nine out of ten houses are empty. Those who have a little property have moved to other places to avoid the bandit disaster. Raising funds and dispatching workers are both difficult. In addition, the county has the longest route and the most severe banditry.</p>
<p>The funds for the roadbed to be raised account for the majority, amounting to 120,000 yuan. The orders of the government cannot leave the county gate, and it is difficult to raise even a few thousand yuan. There is a feeling of having no rice to cook.</p>
<p>Jiangxi-Anhui Road: 92 percent of the road in Fuliang within the Jinghu Road has been completed. People in Poyang are very negative about raising funds and dispatching workers because the route is too far from the city. The earthwork cost in Duchang has also been raised as scheduled, and the costs of small wooden bridges and culvert pipes are also being raised. The only reason for the delay is that the local area is unstable and there is too much rain and snow. Hukou is a poor and barren area, and only half of the road funds have been raised. In September last year, the Anhui bandits occupied the route, so the workers did not dare to go to the road to work, and the project was suspended. Jiangxi-Zhejiang Road: In addition to the three counties of Nanchang, Jinxian, and Dongxiang, which have started construction in order, Yugan, Yujiang, Linchuan, Qianshan, Yushan, and other townships will start construction soon. The three counties of Shangrao, Yiyang, and Guixi are unable to raise funds and dispatch workers because the bandit wind is very strong. Even the funds for the road that have been raised have been diverted for bandit suppression. For this reason, in addition to daring not to slack off in the progress of the road work, we will also try our best to increase the earthwork to be completed on each line in order to complete it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Banditry in Various Counties of Jiaodong <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: Since the change in Gao Guizi's troops in Zhucheng, the troops stationed in various places have been transferred to encircle and suppress [them], leaving the defenses empty. Taking advantage of this opportunity, local ruffians colluded with bandits to plunder wantonly. The bandit situation in various counties is explored and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Jiaoxian: Jiaoxian has been supplying provisions to the stationed troops for years, owing tens of thousands of yuan in public funds. A public welfare bureau was specially established to reorganize [finances].</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the bureau has added a "military post-disaster donation" to the land tax and grain levy, collecting as much as three yuan for every tael of silver. It is found that Jiaoxian levies about 48,000 taels of land tax silver in total.</p>
<p>This post-disaster donation can collect 144,000 yuan. The pursuit is now very urgent, and the people cannot bear the suffering. In addition, with the stationed troops being transferred elsewhere and bandits rampant, murders and arson are heard of every day. There are about ten large and small gangs of bandits. The well-known bandit leaders are Zhu Daheshang, Sun Yuanshan, Li Xiaoqi, and Qi Mai, etc. The large gangs have hundreds of people, and the small gangs also have dozens of people. Since the beginning of spring, more than 200 families have been victimized, and about 60 to 70 people have been killed by bandits. The most tragic victims are the Zhang family in Shuangjing, Dongxiang. All five members of the family were burned to death by bandits.</p>
<p>Zhucheng: Since the Gao (Guizi) and Fan (Xiji) troops opened fire in the county, many civilian houses in the city have been demolished by Gao's troops.</p>
<p>[These houses were] moved to be used as defensive works. The residents who suffered from the shelling are countless. The wealthy households outside the city have long since moved to other places to avoid [the conflict].</p>
<p>Those who could not afford to move were either plundered by bandits or caught by government soldiers to serve as transportation teams. According to those who came to Qingdao from the county to seek refuge,</p>
<p>the villages near the city have been almost completely deserted. The villages a little further from the city are also often subjected to tragedies due to the prevalence of bandits, leaving people in a state where they cannot live and cannot die.</p>
<p>Pingdu: Pingdu is adjacent to Jiaoxian. Large gangs of bandits from Jiaoxian often come to Pingdu to kidnap [people for ransom]. According to investigations, dozens of families in the county have also been kidnapped, with losses of no less than 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Although the families in various counties who have suffered misfortune have been harmed by bandits, none have reported the cases to the county government, because the official authorities cannot do anything to help, and only incur resentment from the bandits. Therefore, even though they have suffered tragedy, they only blame their own bitter fate. (April 7)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Han Stele Discovered in Outer Mongolia <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Suiyuan Dispatch: The world knows that the Mongolians are vulgar and uncultured, with a nature close to savagery. However, observing the solemnity and secrecy with which they preserve the mausoleum of Genghis Khan, the Yuan Dynasty leader, even the Ming and Qing imperial tombs may be hard-pressed to match it. Recently, it has been widely rumored that a Han stele has been discovered in Outer Mongolia, which is temporarily considered rare and unheard of. However, it is not known that the Han Dynasty was the most powerful militarily, subjugating the northern regions and dividing [them into] districts and counties. Today's Mongolia was the Xiongnu at that time, and erecting a stele to record achievements is also within expectations. It is heard that the stele is located in the Ordos Sum near Kulun (Mongolians call temples Sum), which is about forty li to the southeast. This Sum is a Yuan Dynasty building, majestic and magnificent, and incomparably brilliant. In the past, the Dalai Lama often came here for pilgrimage. The stele is in front of the temple, inside an octagonal pavilion. This pavilion is similar in shape to the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests in the old capital, but on a smaller scale, with similar splendor. The stele is about eleven feet high, four feet wide, and the thickness is equal to the width. The stone has golden specks, and it shines brightly when viewed at night. All four sides of the stele have inscriptions, with traces of moss here and there,</p>
<p>and the handwriting is mottled, tall, vigorous and powerful, and the carvings are all skillful. It is indeed a product of the early Han Dynasty. The inscription on the stele is not recorded, but it does contain the words "General of the Agile Cavalry."</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty, the Assistant Resident Officer of Uliastai (Zhi Rui) once visited the site and ordered his attendants to make many rubbings, which were distributed to friends and former colleagues upon his return to Beijing. Thirty years have passed since then, and they have long been lost without a trace. If we want to regain the treasure of the Han Dynasty inscriptions, we must wait for the recovery of Outer Mongolia; otherwise, we dare not lightly tour the Yuan capital to observe it. It is heard that the Mongolians call this stele the "Stele God" and preserve it with great effort, sharing incense and paper money with it after the deity is worshiped. The base of the stele only has slight traces of smoke. (April 1)</p>

<p>Near Maoki Port, Xinkai Road, Jiangsu Province, today (the 10th)</p>
<p>At dawn, more than twenty bandit ships with more than one thousand bandits passed through. After the third public security sub-bureau at that location reported it to the Wuxian Public Security Bureau by telephone, Director Cao, in addition to ordering the second platoon of the third county police company stationed in Shuzhuang to strengthen its defense, also telegraphed the third detachment of the second company stationed in Puzhuang to go to assist in the defense nearby. At the same time, he has reported to the county government and requested the bandit suppression headquarters to send a team to rush to suppress [the bandits].</p>
<p>Two shallow-water gunboats, Zhaowu and Baosu, came to Suzhou yesterday upon orders. Today, Hu, the commander-in-chief, has issued 20 rifles, 24 Mauser pistols, and 18 submachine guns to them, and they have departed to suppress the bandits in West Taihu Lake.</p>
<p>The Taihu Lake Bandit Suppression Headquarters today reported the bandit situation in various counties to</p>
<p>various institutions as follows: "On the 8th of this month, according to Xu Pu Cheng, the third district chief of the Zhejiang Inland Water Police, (1) the bandits near Guangde on the afternoon of the 5th made contact with the self-defense corps and fought fiercely for ten hours. (2) In the morning of the next day, the bandits were unable to resist and retreated in a panic. (3) Intelligence reports indicate that there are still more than a thousand bandits about seventy li from Guangde.</p>
<p>According to Zhong Huan, the commander of the Thirtieth Regiment, (1) Hu Jianchen from Taizi Temple, Changxing, reported that when he was holding a ritual in Xianqiao, many bandits suddenly came and tied up the Taoist Fei Nianrong.</p>

<p>Thorough measures to prohibit prostitution: Since the county government implemented the prohibition of prostitution, prostitutes have been found in hotels and brothels from time to time, but they have always been dealt with by fines. Recently, an order was received from the Department of Civil Affairs, ordering that in the future, whenever prostitutes are found, they should not be punished with a fine, but must be sent to an educational institution for training. County Magistrate Sun, upon receiving the order, immediately raised the issue for discussion at this county government meeting and decided that in the future, all public and private prostitutes found will be sent to the women's department of the Relief Institute (i.e., Tongrentang) for accommodation and support.</p>

<p>After Yongjiheng went bankrupt, the Yongjiheng Salt Store opened by Zhou Fuqiu, a transport merchant, went bankrupt because of business failures in recent years, and various money houses and banks</p>
<p>successively pressed for payment. Therefore, the store declared bankruptcy a month ago. As a result, the amount of silver owed was more than 1.8 million, and even in Yangzhou alone, there were more than 580,000. It is estimated that the money houses in this city that deal with the salt store are Yufeng, Lichang, Xinyu, Qingda, and Hui.</p>
<p>The number is the largest. However, this matter is very important to the Yangzhou market. Therefore, the Qianzhuang publicly requested Wang Jingting from the Chamber of Commerce to go to Shanghai to seriously negotiate with Zhou Weibin, who is currently in charge of the salt store.</p>

<p>Shanghai Struggles Under Encirclement in the First Half</p>
<p>Yao En Han Scores Seven Goals Alone</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, the men's basketball finals were held. The Tianjin and Shanghai teams competed for the championship. Drawn by the renowned reputations of both teams, spectators packed the basketball court, leaving no space. Tianjin initially fielded the Nan Rund Kai five tigers. Shanghai's lineup consisted of Huang Yunli and Liang Guoquan as forwards, He Tong as center, and Wang Jinpeng and Lu Zhongen as guards. Midway through the game, Tianjin's right guard, Wang Xiliang, sustained a foot injury and was replaced by He Buyun. From the start, the Shanghai team was consistently trapped and unable to make progress. Huang Yunli and Liang Guoquan could not even get close to the basket. Tang Baokun first scored a point from a free throw, opening the record. Although Shanghai tried hard to defend, they were no match for the five tigers' onslaught. Tang Baokun was especially active, constantly making it difficult for the opponents to anticipate his moves. The score at the end of the first half was:</p>
<p>Seventeen to Four, Tianjin wins. Shanghai's four points came from Liang Guoquan and Lu Zhongen each making a free throw, and He Tong scoring a field goal.</p>
<p>After the break, the teams switched sides and Shanghai changed its lineup again, with Wei Haiqing as center and Tan Dahua replacing Huang Yunli as right forward. At the start, the Shanghai team was still flustered. Tan Dahua was also not having much success. Tianjin's Liu Jianchang made a point from a free throw, opening the record. After that, the game remained closely contested for a while. Shanghai seemed to be gaining momentum slightly. At that time, Kong Guangyi had replaced Wang Jinpeng as right forward and also scored a field goal. Tianjin immediately called a timeout, bringing Yao En Han, the Far Eastern star, in place of Wei Pengyun. The Tianjin team was like taking a shot of morphine, their spirits revived. Yao En Han, with his long-range shots and close-range attacks, did not miss. He scored six goals alone,</p>
<p>and one point from a free throw. Together with Tang Baokun, they were truly a great partnership. Tianjin right guard,</p>
<p>Wang Xiliang, also entered the game with an injury. Shanghai relied solely on Kong Guangyi to fight, but one hand cannot clap. However, in the second half, the Shanghai team played better and was able to handle everything. If they had this spirit in the first half, the score would not have been so far apart. The score for the second half was twenty-one to nineteen, Tianjin wins. The total score was thirty-eight to twenty-three. The men's basketball championship thus went to Tianjin.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, in the women's basketball finals, Shanghai Jia played against the Peiping team.

The two sides were evenly matched, and the game was extremely fierce. In the first quarter, the score was five to six, with Peiping winning. In the second quarter, the Shanghai team launched a major counterattack, with forward Chen Yingrui standing out in particular. As a result, the score was three to five, with Shanghai winning. The total score for the first half was ten to nine, with Shanghai winning by only one point. The Peiping team suffered from inaccurate free throws.</p>
<p>Final Struggle</p>

The result of the third quarter was seven to five, with Shanghai winning. At that time, the total score was seventeen to fourteen, with Shanghai winning. In the fourth quarter, the two sides made their final struggle. Shanghai's famous player Chen Yingrui went in and out of the game, continuously scoring two goals.

<p>announcing the end of the game. The scoreboard showed twenty-four to twenty-four. The scores were equal. But according to the rules of women's basketball, there is no overtime.

<p>丨Yesterday Two to One Victory over Hong Kong丨</p>
<p>Competition Was Quite Intense</p>
<p>The Guangdong and Hong Kong teams held the men's volleyball championship finals at 1:00 PM on the 10th. The audience reached 3,000 people, extremely crowded. The fierce battle lasted two hours.</p>
<p>The once-famous Hong Kong team was defeated by Guangdong by a score of one to two. The competition is briefly recorded below.</p>

<p>Hong Kong Takes the Lead</p>
<p>At 3:15 PM, the members of the two teams entered the field in uniform, performing some warm-up exercises. When the time arrived, the referee blew the whistle, and the fierce battle began. Hong Kong's Zou Bingxin served the ball and scored two points in a row, opening the record. Guangdong suffered a setback at the start. The Hong Kong team then gained another four points, making the score four to zero. Their momentum was overwhelming.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Everyone Is Cautious <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>However, the Guangdong team did not lose heart due to this small setback. The spirit of the entire team was invigorated.</p>
<p>The front and middle row partnerships attacked smoothly and scored three points. At this point, the competition between the two sides became increasingly fierce. Moreover, their strengths were evenly matched, and everyone was cautious, not daring to be negligent. It was extremely difficult to make progress. After a long stalemate, Hong Kong maintained its advantage, completing the formation with a score of eleven to three.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Full Counterattack <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>At that time, the audience felt that the Hong Kong team was sure to win. Unexpectedly, Guangdong suddenly launched a full-scale counterattack. Li Lianying in the front row repeatedly displayed his rapid smashes, which were able to hit the target every time. As a result, the score gradually increased, making the proportion eight to eleven. The morale of the army was boosted.</p>

<p>Seeing that the enemy's momentum was strong, Hong Kong's formation gradually became chaotic. Moreover, because they were too eager, they gave the opponent an opportunity to take advantage of. Guangdong pressed harder and harder. Before long, they suddenly turned the tables and won with a score of eighteen to fifteen. Although the Hong Kong team struggled to catch up, it was difficult to do so. The first game ended in defeat with a score of seventeen to twenty-one.</p>

<p>Winning Applause</p>
<p>After a few minutes of rest, the game continued, and the fighting between the two sides became even more intense. The performance was very exciting, winning a lot of applause from the audience. The three players in Guangdong's middle row smashed the ball effectively, winning many points. Progress was made evenly, and it was difficult to tell the difference. Suddenly, the Hong Kong team led again with a score of eleven to nine. After changing sides,</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Chen Xibing served the ball and scored four points in a row. After several more exchanges,</p>
<p>they won with a score of twenty-one to eighteen. The two teams each won one game.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Decisive Key <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The third game was the key to the final victory and the championship. Therefore, both sides spared no effort to compete. Chen Xibing, a strong player from the Hong Kong team, repeatedly used his smashing skills in the hope of killing the enemy. However, the Guangdong side's front row guarding skills were very good, and it was difficult to succeed. The scores rose and fell, following each other closely. After each team reached eighteen, the Guangdong team succeeded in serving three times, winning the final victory. The volleyball championship was thus won by Guangdong.</p>

<p>Wins Shanghai Jia Two to Zero</p>
<p>The Guangdong and Shanghai Jia teams both had excellent results in past competitions, and their strengths were about the same. However, the Guangdong team's offensive was stronger, which was their specialty. In yesterday's final, Guangdong won two to zero. Their skills were different, so victory was not a fluke.</p>
<p>The game started at 3:00 PM. At first, the situation was very balanced. After Guangdong led with eight to six, Shanghai Jia's Huang Xingfang served the ball and suddenly scored six points in a row, reversing the winning trend. Guangdong then stepped up its defense, setting up a strong defense in the back row and working hard to attack in the front row. They were able to gradually succeed. Situ Hui also bravely made contributions,</p>
<p>scoring as many as eight points on one serve, creating a ratio of sixteen to thirteen. In an instant, they scored another five points, winning the first game with twenty-one to sixteen.</p>
<p>In the second game, Guangdong continued to attack victoriously, winning every round. Shanghai Jia became increasingly unable to support itself, and its serves repeatedly failed. Although they once advanced to twelve to thirteen, unfortunately there was no progress after that, and they ultimately failed again with sixteen to twenty-one. Guangdong won two games in a row and won the championship. The lineups of the two teams are listed on the left.</p>

<p>(1) The Doubles Battle</p>
<p>In the women's tennis finals, Tianjin played against Shanghai. Two singles matches had been completed on the 9th, with Tianjin and Shanghai each winning one group. Tianjin's Liang Peiyao won against Shanghai's Kuai Shuping two to zero. Shanghai's Li Lian won against Tianjin's Liang Peiyu two to zero. Yesterday morning's doubles match had a significant impact on the third and fourth singles matches. The game started at 9:00 AM. The Liang sisters flew horizontally and vertically, with superb skills. They won Shanghai's Li Lian and Kuai Shuping in two sets with scores of six to four and six to three.</p>
<p>Referee Hao Boyang</p>
<p>Winning Situation</p>
<p>Shanghai's Kuai Shuping served first, followed by Tianjin. Shanghai won two games in a row at the start, with great momentum. Li Lian served, and although Tianjin won one game, Shanghai won again on the backhand. Tianjin quickly caught up, making it a three-three draw, and then a</p>
<p>four-four draw. Li and Kuai gradually revealed panic after winning first and then drawing. They lost two games in a row. The Liang sisters then won the first set with six to four.</p>
<p>Continuing to fight, Shanghai served, and Tianjin lost two games in a row again. Peiyu and Peiyao remained calm and unhurried, making it a two-two draw, and then a three-three draw. After that, Shanghai gradually became tired, and Kuai Shuping was exhausted from running around, making it difficult to defend.</p>
<p>Tianjin waited for work while Shanghai worked, winning three games in a row, and then winning the second set with six to three　　Tianjin's Victory</p>
<p>Tianjin's ability to win against Shanghai can be described as follows: (1) They were unhurried and calm. Although they lost two games in a row at the beginning, their attitude remained calm. When the enemy became flustered, they seized the opportunity to advance. (2) They were able to take advantage of the enemy's weaknesses. Shanghai's Li Lian connected the ball quite steadily, which was very risky. However, Kuai Shuping hit the ball too fiercely and was too impatient, so the ball often fell in front of the net or flew out of bounds. Tianjin took advantage of this weakness and desperately hit the ball towards Kuai, so that Li Lian had no chance to get the ball. As a result, Kuai Shuping was exhausted, and Li Lian could not support it alone, losing again and again. Tianjin then won.</p>
<p>(2) The Singles Battle</p>
<p>In women's tennis, Tianjin had already won one singles and one doubles group. In the afternoon, in the second singles group,</p>
<p>Tianjin's Liang Peiyu won against Shanghai's Kuai Shuping again, one group six to two, two to six,</p>
<p>eight to six. Shanghai's Li Lian won against Tianjin's Liang Peiyao in one group, three to six, six to zero, six to three. Tianjin still won the championship with a score of three to two.</p>

<p>Hong Kong Team That Won the Swimming Championship Yesterday</p>
<p>Photographed by Wang Kai</p>
<p>Chinese swimming is extremely underdeveloped, and its results are far behind. This time it was held in Hangzhou, using the Zhijiang University swimming pool. The pool did not have a hot water pipe, and the spring was extremely cold, so the difference in results was natural and should not be blamed on the selection.</p>
<p>However, the rise of swimming athletes in Liaoning was unexpected. Shi Xinglong's long-distance swimming is well-known. It is said that Shi's younger brother, Shi Xingzhi, is good at short-distance swimming and is famous in Dalian. If he could have come this time, Liaoning would have won the championship in eight or nine out of ten cases. Shi Xinglong is used to long-distance swimming, but the Zhijiang swimming pool is too small. Shi is not used to turning around while swimming, so his results were poor. This is also a shortcoming of the conference. Guangdong's swimming results were slightly worse, and the absence of relay swimming</p>
<p>further reduced the team's color. Shanghai did not even get a seat except for relay swimming, which was unexpected.</p>

<p>The National Games, which opened to this day, has reached its end. It was originally scheduled to close on the 10th, but due to the heavy rain on the 8th, it was extended by one day.

<p>Regret of Missing Out: Yesterday's basketball and volleyball games were packed with spectators even before the matches started. Those who couldn't find seats resorted to climbing on wooden structures or clinging to pillars, an overwhelming number. A group of students from a certain girls' school arrived on time, only to find no space left, resulting in their regret. One of the students jokingly said to her classmates, "Our intention wasn't sincere enough today, leading to our punishment of facing the wall."</p>
<p>Overheated People: The last few scenes were the most exciting. Yesterday, the temperature in Hangzhou suddenly rose, and the audience's enthusiasm also surged with the weather. The biggest sufferers were the children, squeezed into the crowd, unable to see or move. Around 3 o'clock, two children had already fainted from the heat in the basketball court. Additionally, a middle-aged man collapsed on the ground. Both were carried out by the municipal hospital ambulance team for treatment. It was reported that there were over ten similar fainting incidents in various venues due to the scorching sun and unbearable atmosphere.</p>
<p>Legal Trouble: In the southeast corner of the basketball court, two young men started fighting over standing space. One was punched red near his left eye and argued relentlessly. Despite police mediation, they continued to brawl and were taken out of the venue together and sent to the police station for investigation. Getting into legal trouble for watching a lively event is not worth it.</p>
<p>Like Vermicelli Dots: The audience around the volleyball court formed a square shape, resembling a face, with the net in the middle like a line, and the ball like a dot. If Dr. Zhang Feng, the inventor of the Shape-Number Character Method, were to see this, he would surely boast about his "vermicelli dot" method.</p>
<p>Promoting Foreign Goods: The Quaker Oats Company sent coupons to players, coaches, and referees, entitling them to a free serving of Quaker Oats at the Hangzhou YMCA Western restaurant. The coupon stated that it had nourishing and health-promoting effects.</p>
<p>Promoting Domestic Goods: The Shanghai and Hangzhou Joint Association of Domestic Goods Factories held a mobile exhibition in Hangzhou this time. They also had preferential measures for athletes from various provinces. Those wearing athlete badges on these two days (today and tomorrow) could sign their names and draw a lot. Each lot had a domestic goods gift, with the largest being domestic wool and cloth, and the smallest being domestic candies and toothpaste. The efforts of those promoting domestic goods are commendable.</p>
<p>A Small Token: The Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Provincial Party Department, noting the gathering of athletes from afar, hosted them in the grand hall last night. Besides speeches and performances, each person received a bag of refreshments and a package of Hangzhou local products. It was said that the contents of the local product package, such as tea, silk fabrics, and scenery items, were worth about two silver dollars each, totaling more than 1,900 packages distributed.</p>
<p>Emptied Out: The Games are scheduled to close today, so the athletes will only stay in Hangzhou for one night. Yesterday afternoon, they rushed to the money storage to withdraw their deposits. The amounts were minimal, and they bought local products in the market to take home.</p>

<p>Dr. Ma Guli's Lecture at Nanzhong</p>
<p>Dr. Ma Guli, a special commissioner sent by the French Ministry of Education to investigate higher education in China, delivered a lecture at the auditorium of Nanzhong First Academy at 3:00 PM on the 9th at the invitation of Principal Zhang of Nanzhong. The French consul, guests from central party and government agencies, and faculty and students of the school, totaling over a thousand people, attended. First, Principal Zhang Jingqiu of Nanzhong gave a welcoming speech, saying that Dr. Ma Guli not only speaks Chinese but also has a deep understanding of Chinese literature, which is admirable. Then, Dr. Ma Guli took the stage and spoke in Chinese without translation, saying that although he studied Chinese language and literature in Paris, he lacked experience and feared that he would not be able to understand many things, and asked for forgiveness. He expressed his deep desire to discuss academic research with ambitious people and young students, but with so many topics, he didn't know where to start. He then spoke about important issues related to China and Europe, namely, the research of Sinology in European countries. Europeans have been studying Chinese Sinology for a long time. During the Liang Dynasty, Europeans traveled to China and returned with notes and various research findings, but they were still in the preliminary stage. There was further progress in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. In the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, many scholars of literature, philosophy, politics, and economics produced and published works. In the nineteenth century, there were countless books on Chinese literature, such as philosophy and history, showing the extent of European research on Chinese literature. Europeans have translated many Chinese literary books, and their research achievements continue to this day. Many European countries have Chinese schools to study Chinese literature, especially France. There are four places to study Chinese literature in Paris, France: (1) the School of Oriental Languages, (2) the Chinese Language School, (3) the University of Paris, and (4) the French Academy. In addition, there are Chinese libraries and research societies. The Oriental Language Library is rich in famous Chinese books. In addition to the six public libraries in France that study Chinese, there are also three private libraries. French Sinologists and professors teaching French to Chinese students can easily understand and achieve twice the result with half the effort. Chinese figures like Wu Zhihui and Li Shizeng have all studied in France. The United Kingdom and Germany also study Chinese literature. London has the School of Oriental Languages and the Cambridge Library, which also has a rich collection of books. Berlin, Germany, has the School of Oriental Languages, and the library also has a large collection of books. Their universities also have Chinese professors teaching Sinology. In addition, countries such as Italy, Rome, Poland, and the Netherlands are studying Chinese literature, and their progress will undoubtedly be greater. Many European scholars of Chinese literature have translated classics such as the Thirteen Classics dozens of times (except for the Gongyang Commentary, which has not been translated), philosophical works such as the Tao Te Ching have been translated seventy-three times, and Zhuangzi, Liezi, Lu's Springs and Autumns, Mozi, Huainanzi, and Xunzi have all been translated. Historical books such as A Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government and Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian have all been translated into French. Collections such as the Eight Great Masters of Tang and Song prose have not been completely translated, and only a portion of literary history has been translated. More than 400 poems by Du Fu have been translated by the British, and there are also translations of poems by Li Bai. In addition, the main points of Chinese culture, poetry, lyrics, novels, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West, and Dramatical Ballads have all been translated. In addition to translating the above-mentioned books, Europeans plan to translate the complete history of China and have already begun translating a history of the Five Dynasties of China. The above is a general overview of the research on Sinology in various European countries. The reason why Europeans want to study Chinese Sinology is that China was the earliest civilization, and the ancient texts of more than 4,000 years have considerable value. In the minds and needs of Europeans, there is great interest in research. From my observation, Chinese culture is like the recent progress in industry and commerce. China is an ancient civilized country, and Europe is a newly advanced country in terms of material things. China has adopted some of it, and Europeans also deeply admire Chinese culture. The so-called exchange of spiritual civilization and material civilization has a profound impact on the international future. Finally, Principal Zhang gave a speech of thanks, saying that the French consul changed the date of his lecture because everyone had been sitting for a long time. The meeting ended at about 4 o'clock.</p>

<p>Camp Office Starts Work</p>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Boy Scout Association began preparing for the jamboree, all comrades have been invigorated and working harder. With the jamboree approaching, the association, in accordance with the resolutions of the fourth preparatory meeting, officially established the camp office on that day and began work. The manager of the camp's commercial firm arrived in town yesterday afternoon and brought various daily necessities for the Boy Scouts purchased from Shanghai. The prices of these items were assessed one by one yesterday. Other food items were carefully selected for quality, and their prices were lower than those in the town market. This is truly an example of mutual assistance and fair trade. Zhu Yulin, the registration officer of the association, is currently serving as the Boy Scout instructor in Jiangning, and is unable to handle the affairs of the registration office. Liu Tingzhang from the general affairs office has been transferred to fill his position. The position vacated in the general affairs office has been specially assigned to Yao Qisu from the provincial training department.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Yixian Warship's Launching Ceremony Yesterday <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Chen Shaokuan's Talk in Shanghai. The launching ceremony of the Yixian warship built by the Navy Department was held at the Gaochangmiao Jiangnan Shipbuilding Factory shipyard at 9:00 AM yesterday. Chen Shaokuan, the Deputy Minister of Naval Affairs, came to Shanghai by train from Beijing to attend. After the meeting at 9:00 AM, about 50 people attended, including Chen Shaokuan, Chen Xunyong, Ma Deji, the Yixian warship construction section of the Shanghai Naval Disarmament Office, and the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Factory personnel. The ceremony order was quite simple. First, the workers placed the keel (that is, the steel plate at the bottom of the ship) in place. Chen Shaokuan personally held the iron hammer and installed the first cap nail. The second nail was hammered by Chen Xunyong, commander of the training fleet. Then, photos were taken, and the ceremony ended. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency went at 8:00 AM yesterday morning, was able to participate in the ceremony, and met with Chen Shaokuan. When asked about national affairs and the defense situation of the Yangtze River, the talk he received is recorded on the left. (Reporter of Guowen News Agency asked) Bangbu went to Fujian Provincial Party Committee members Lin Zhiyuan, Zheng Bao, Chen Naiyuan, Xu Xianshi, Cheng Shiyun, and Public Security Bureau Director Wu Shu and other six people, recently there are rumors of being killed, has the sir heard of it? (Chen replied) I have not heard of it, I am afraid there is not necessarily this fact. (Asked) Since there has not been an incident, where are the Lin group members imprisoned, and how will Minister Yang solve this matter? Has the rest of the solution been decided? (Answer) After Lin Zhiyuan and other members were escorted back from Hongshan Bridge, they were probably held in Youxi or Yanping. As for solving the Fujian issue, it is a prerequisite that Lu will first release the Fujian Committee members. Minister Yang should follow the central government's plan, even if Lu does violate it, the central government will have its own methods to deal with it. Will it tend to a military solution? (Answer) Not necessarily, because the Fujian change cannot be compared to the Northwest Yan-Feng rebellion this time, and the scope is small, so the central government does not want to rush to suppress it. The reason for slowly proceeding is also this, and when there is a method, it will still be handled in a mild manner. (Asked) Has the list of committee members for reorganizing the Fujian Provincial Government been internally determined? After Minister Yang comes to Shanghai, will the Fujian affairs be handled by Commander Chen Jiliang? Is it true that Chen will succeed the Chairman of Fujian? (Answer) I have not heard of Commander Chen Jiliang as Chairman of Fujian. I have not heard of the central government's decision or proposal on the selection of Fujian Committee members. The routine affairs of Fujian Province seem to be handled by the Provincial Government. (Asked) What is Minister Yang's condition like, and will he return to Fujian recently? Is he recuperating at Hongqiao Hospital, or is he recuperating at a residence on Avenue Joffre in this city? (Answer) Minister Yang's return to Fujian is undecided. What he is suffering from is hemoptysis, and he is currently recuperating at a relative's house in this city. (Asked) With the situation unstable, what is the navy's defense on the Yangtze River? (Answer) Military ships are stationed along the Yangtze River from Yichang in the west to Wusong in the east, in various ports such as Shashi, Xindi, Hankou, Anqing, Nanjing, and Tongzhou. Although there were bandits disturbing Xindi, Madang, Nantong, etc., they have now been pacified after being suppressed by the navy. All the captured bandits have also been sent to the local defense army for legal proceedings, so the defense is very strict. (Asked) When will you return to Beijing? (Answer) I have to return to Beijing tonight. At this point, because Chen was going to the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Factory to contact the Yixian ship, he said goodbye.</p>

Looking to the south, we admire you. Our association has been founded for 20 years, but due to its lack of capacity, the results have not been significant. Recently, thanks to the National Government's promotion and the succession of the whole country, the situation is magnificent and the future is unlimited. Your province is the birthplace of the revolution and the most prosperous region. We hope that your association will persevere, work hard, so that domestic goods will be promoted and shine globally. The national economy and people's livelihood are deeply dependent. We send this telegram to congratulate you and wish you success. Wang Jie'an, Wang Xingyi, and Wang Hanqiang, standing affairs committee members of the China Domestic Goods Maintenance Association, respectfully bow."</p>

After the Association complied with the order to delete, it still retained in the fourth paragraph of the procedure: "But if the nature of its business does have unmergeable parts, after investigation, it may be changed as appropriate." The case was reported to the central government, and now the Central Training Department's Order No. 2258 opened, "After investigation, the proviso of this paragraph conflicts with the first paragraph's stipulation that industrial organizations should strictly abide by Article 5 of the Law on Industrial and Commercial Guilds, "The establishment of guilds in the same industry in the same region shall be limited to one guild."</p>

In the case of all the District Party Department expenses, it was decided that it was difficult to subsidize due to the difficulty of the expenses. The County Government should reply to the letter, that is, I hope you will check it out.</p>

<p>Hailstorms Hit Shanghai Twice</p>
<p>Water Accumulated into Ditches in a Short Time</p>
<p>Wing On Company Builds Small Dam</p>
<p>Two Merchant Ships Unable to Enter Port</p>
<p>Shanghai-Nanjing Flights Suspended</p>
<p>In recent days, the climate in Shanghai has been changing rapidly, with continuous rain and wind. Although the Cold Food Festival has just passed, it feels like the plum rain season. Yesterday morning, as the sun rose and shone brightly, people thought the weather would clear up. However, in an instant, dark clouds gathered, and the air became stuffy and humid, threatening rain. Thus, the weather alternated between rain and clearing, without stopping all morning. Half an hour before noon, suddenly dark clouds filled the sky, and most people waited expectantly, thinking that heavy rain would fall at any moment. But the rain god did not come for a long time, and the sky became darker and darker, the gloomy atmosphere gradually intensifying. Noon suddenly turned dark, almost like dusk. At 12:00 noon, it was like 6:00 or 7:00 in the evening.</p>
<p>Rain and Hail: The exact time of the daytime darkness was 12:03 PM, and it gradually recovered after about five or six minutes. The sunlight was reborn, and coarse raindrops fell like ink, mixed with hail. For a moment, the roof tiles all rattled, and the raindrops and hail pattered and tinkled on the glass windows, creating a clear and pleasant sound, like large and small pearls falling on a jade plate. After three or four minutes, the hail stopped and the rain fell, as heavy as the sky pouring down, cascading. In an instant, the water on the ground was ankle-deep, and the sewers could not drain the water in time, so they overflowed. This lasted for about forty-five minutes before it stopped.</p>
<p>Roads Flooded: During the heavy rain, low-lying areas turned into swamps. There were few pedestrians on both sides of the roads. The area around Yisheng Building on Nanjing Road is low-lying, and the Wing On Company was flooded like a ditch, making it difficult for customers to walk. The entrance facing Yinghua Street was severely affected by the flood, and an emergency measure had to be taken to build a temporary dam to prevent water from entering. The situation was quite serious, as can be seen. The rain subsided slightly after about forty-five minutes.</p>
<p>Ill-Fated Peach Blossoms: Around the Qingming Festival, on Longhua Road, people in silk clothes and hats flocked to the area to swing and stroll. Unfortunately, the weather was unfavorable, with rain on two out of three days, which disappointed pedestrians. Yesterday, the buses going directly to Longhua were deserted. The beautiful peach blossoms and weeping willows were devastated by the heavy rain, which was a great disappointment.</p>
<p>River Enshrouded in Mist: Yesterday, during the heaviest rain, the Huangpu River became a cloud of smoke. It was difficult to see across the river. Small boats and cargo lighters on the river dared not venture out and remained at the docks to avoid the rain. The river was deserted, with very few boats sailing, which was unprecedented.</p>
<p>Lightning Strikes Poles: Yesterday, thunder and lightning struck, with continuous rumbling sounds. It was reported that two telephone poles in front of the Sanbei Factory on Longhua Road were struck by lightning and split in two, and the power lines also fell to the ground. However, the power company sent workers to repair them soon after. It was also reported that three telephone poles near Tianbao Li on Haining Road were knocked down by lightning, causing considerable damage to the power lines. Workers were sent to repair them on the same day.</p>
<p>Loading and Unloading Halted: The stevedores at the various docks stopped working yesterday due to the heavy rain. Cargo lighters were also unable to open their hatches, which delayed the export of merchant ships.</p>
<p>Two Ships Detained by Fog: China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received a telegram from the Guangji, stating that it encountered heavy rain and fog near Zhoushan and had to anchor temporarily. The Haiyan also telegraphed that it encountered heavy rain and fog after leaving Wenzhou and had to anchor temporarily, delaying its arrival in Shanghai. Flights Suspended: The Shanghai-Chengdu Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Communications suspended flights to Nanjing yesterday morning because the sky had not cleared, the weather had suddenly become hot, and there was light fog, which indicated that it would rain. Around noon, black clouds covered the sky, and heavy rain fell soon after. If the weather is clear today, flights will resume as usual.</p>
<p>Dramatic Murder of Father by Kidnapper</p>
<h3 id="e161">Unexpected Encounter <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Having Worn Out Shoes Searching in Vain</p>
<p>Found Without Any Effort</p>
<p>Wan Guoxiang, Full of Evil,</p>
<p>Cannot Escape in Front of the City God Temple</p>
<p>In the eighth month of the lunar calendar last year, a kidnapping and murder case occurred in Wanjiatun, a village in the northern part of Wuwei County, Anhui Province. The victim was shot and killed while resisting the kidnappers, who then demanded a ransom. The victim's fate remains unknown. The Wuwei County government later learned that the main perpetrator had fled to Shanghai and dispatched police officers to Shanghai twice to apprehend him, but to no avail. The six police officers stayed for a long time and ran out of funds. They were planning to return to Wuwei today to report back when they unexpectedly encountered the perpetrator while taking shelter from the rain in the City God Temple. They arrested him. Although the matter is minor, the situation is quite unusual. The details of the case are recorded below:</p>
<p>Kidnapping Son and Killing Father: Wan Zhikuan, a native of Wanjiatun, a village in the northern part of Wuwei County, Anhui Province, was a farmer by trade. He owned more than 300 mu of fertile land and was known as a local wealthy man. As a result, he came to the attention of bandits. Wan and his wife, Mrs. Wang, were an elderly couple over forty years old. They had a son named Xiaodai, whom they cherished as the apple of their eye. He was twelve years old. On the night of the fourteenth day of the eighth lunar month last year, more than ten bandits suddenly came and kidnapped Xiaodai. Wan was shot and killed by the bandits while trying to protect his beloved son.</p>
<p>Cousin is the Main Perpetrator: The case caused a sensation throughout the county. Zhang Siwei, the magistrate of Wuwei County, attached great importance to the case and ordered all police agencies in the county to solve it within a limited time. After several months, only five suspects were arrested. After repeated investigations, it was learned that the main perpetrator was Wan Guoxiang, the cousin of the kidnapped child. However, he had long fled to Shanghai, and his address was unknown. Magistrate Zhang dispatched police officer Xuan Wencheng to Shanghai to investigate and arrest him, no matter what.</p>
<p>Unexpected Encounter: Police officer Xuan and five colleagues arrived in Shanghai and stayed at the home of a friend at 40 Malan Road in the French Concession. They searched separately all day long. After more than ten days, there was no trace of him. The funds they had prepared were about to run out, and they planned to return to Wuwei to report back today. Yesterday morning, police officer Xuan and his colleagues went to the City God Temple to sightsee. After sightseeing, they planned to exit through the Fangbang Road gate when heavy rain suddenly began to pour down. Police officer Xuan and his colleagues took shelter from the rain in front of the temple gate. After a while, a man came, wearing a gray cloth shirt and a felt hat, and went straight to the front of the temple, exclaiming about the heavy rain. Police officer Xuan and his colleagues were watching the rain when they suddenly heard a familiar accent. Everyone looked at him, and it was none other than Wan Guoxiang, the main perpetrator of the kidnapping and murder!</p>
<p>Perpetrator's Confession: Police officer Xuan and his colleagues were overjoyed to see Wan Guoxiang and immediately arrested him. They took him to the First District, Second Precinct and presented the facts of the case and the writ. Chief Gao questioned the suspect. According to his confession, he was thirty-two years old and used to be engaged in the rice and wood business. Wan Zhikuan was his uncle. His father was named Baocheng and was the eldest son. He denied shooting his uncle and kidnapping his cousin. He said that he left his hometown on the thirteenth day of the ninth lunar month last year and told his aunt, Mrs. Wang, that he was going to his wife's family in Changzhou. He came to Shanghai once on the twentieth day of the same month and returned to Changzhou in mid-October. He had only been in Shanghai for two days this time. After hearing the confession, Chief Gao, considering the seriousness of the case, prepared a document and sent it to the Judicial Section for punishment that evening.</p>

<p>Liang and Yuan Disappear Simultaneously</p>
<p>Even Their Families Have Moved Away Completely</p>
<p>Honest People Cannot Be Trusted</p>
<p>Liang Reportedly Took a Ship to Hong Kong</p>
<p>Liang Shuxian, the chief revenue officer, and Yuan, a revenue officer of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Accounts Office, suddenly disappeared on Tuesday with 100,000 yuan. Duke, the traffic superintendent of the railway, reported the case to the Public Concession Police the night before. According to Duke, the money was the cash revenue of the railway bureau on Monday and was discovered missing on Wednesday morning. Liang had been working for the railway bureau for more than ten years and was known to be honest. Liang and Yuan did not come to the office yesterday morning, which aroused suspicion. The authorities sent people to their homes, only to find that they had moved away completely. Yuan had not been in office for long and had been recommended by someone. It is rumored that Liang left Shanghai yesterday on the Dollar Line's President Lincoln, but this has not been confirmed. The police in Hong Kong have been telegraphed to board the President Lincoln upon arrival and investigate. Liang was usually efficient and highly regarded by the authorities.</p>
<p>His sudden escape was unexpected. It was learned yesterday morning that Liang had been heavily in debt in recent months and was in dire straits. He had borrowed money from colleagues several times to alleviate the urgent situation.</p>
<p>Lake Bandits Rampant</p>

<p>Due to the rampant lake bandits who come and go without a trace, the towns of Weiting, Zhengyi, Waikuatang, Bacheng, Jiaozhi, Chenmu, etc., along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway's Suzhou-Shanghai section, are experiencing multiple scares a day. Those with a little property in these towns are bringing their families to Shanghai and Suzhou to take temporary refuge. When the Shanghai-Nanjing slow train arrived at the North Station yesterday, it carried more than a hundred refugees from various towns and cities. They either stayed in hotels or went to relatives' homes for temporary shelter.</p>
<p>Tragic Inheritance Dispute</p>
<h3 id="e164">Brother Shoots Brother <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Over 40 Mu of Fertile Land</p>
<p>Five Shots Fired, Blood Flowing Freely</p>
<p>Zhu Laowu, a deceased farmer from Zhujia Zhai, Twenty-Eighth Bao, Nineteenth Tu, West of Xujiahui Town, Shanghai, had two sons and one daughter: Wenming, 32 years old, and Aru, 29 years old, who are both married. After Laowu died, he left more than 40 mu of fertile land that had not yet been divided. As a result, the two brothers quarreled over the inheritance countless times. Although relatives and friends repeatedly tried to persuade them, neither would back down. Wenming harassed Aru again the night before, leading to a fight. However, Aru was very strong, and Wenming suffered minor injuries, harboring resentment in his heart. The next day, he borrowed a pistol from a friend in Xujiahui, intending to take revenge. He encountered Aru returning from a tomb sweeping ceremony in front of Anguo Temple (only a hundred yards from home). They met on a narrow road, and Wenming, consumed by anger, pulled out his gun and fired five shots, hitting Aru's left waist, leg, right arm, etc. Blood flowed freely, and he fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Patrolman Pan Xueceng from the Hongqiao Town Police Station of the First Precinct of the Sixth District heard the news and rushed to the scene. He saw that the injured person was covered in blood and was a terrible sight. The murderer had fled without a trace. After being identified by the villagers, the patrolman reported the incident to the family. Patrolman Pan sent the injured Zhu Aru to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment. His injuries were said to be serious, and his life was in danger. After learning of the incident, Chief Wang Xixiang personally inspected the scene of the incident and ordered all patrolmen to strictly arrest the murderer and bring him to justice.</p>
<p>Beijing Road Incident</p>
<h3 id="e165">Three More People Involved Arrested <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Based on Report from Rickshaw Puller</p>
<p>Three More People Involved Arrested</p>
<p>Taken to Court for Trial Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Deceased Confirmed as Liu Yiqing</p>
<p>Ge Wencheng is a Young Boy</p>
<p>Peng Zijie Denies Everything</p>
<p>On the morning of April 8th, a disturbance occurred on Beijing Road. A patrolman shot and killed one person and arrested eight workers and students. The details of the case have been reported twice in this newspaper after interrogation by the Special District Local Court and the Jiangsu Higher Court Branch. The name of the deceased was initially rumored to be Liu Yiqing, but the police could not confirm it at the time due to incomplete investigation. However, the police, including Detective Shen Chongli, Detective Hua Youshan, Detective Xu Decheng, and Western Detective Bibu from the Gordon Road Police Station, arrested Ge Wencheng, Peng Zijie, and Huang Peng the day before yesterday afternoon, confirming that the deceased was Liu Yiqing without a doubt. At the same time, the detectives also seized a large number of military weapons and various reactionary printed materials and books. According to the crime of illegal possession of military weapons, the case should be handled by the Special District Local Court.</p>
<p>However, since the case involves counter-revolutionary acts, it should be handled by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. The police first brought the case to the Special District Local Court yesterday morning. Judge Sun Yuan of the Criminal Division of the court approved the transfer of the case to the Higher Court Branch for investigation.</p>
<p>The police filed charges and transferred the entire case and witnesses to the Higher Court Branch at 2:00 PM. Judge Song Yuan, the Chief of the Criminal Division, specially opened the Second Court for investigation. First, the police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated the charges and the facts of the case, saying that the police were filing charges according to Article 200 of the Criminal Law. However, since the Law on Military Guns and Cannons has been promulgated, the court could file charges according to Article 1 of the Law on Military Guns and Cannons if it believed that Article 200 of the Criminal Law did not apply to this case. At the same time, Peng Zijie, the second defendant, and Huang Peng, the third defendant, were charged with counter-revolutionary crimes under Article 103 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Puller Reports: As for the facts of the case, on the morning of April 8th at 10:00 AM, a disturbance occurred in front of the Beijing Grand Theater on Beijing Road. A patrolman shot and killed a rioter at the scene. At the time, it was unknown who the deceased was. The police investigated until 10:30 AM yesterday morning when rickshaw puller Wang Asan reported to Chinese Detective Hua Youshan that on the afternoon of the 8th at 4:00 PM, a child, namely Ge Wencheng, the first defendant in the case, and a worker-like person hired his rickshaw and loaded a rattan suitcase, bedding, and schoolbag from 587 Haifang Road to the home of Mrs. Feng at 781 Avenue Road. When they arrived at Mrs. Feng's door, a pistol suddenly fell out of the schoolbag.</p>
<p>They gave the rickshaw puller four jiao as a tip and told him not to say anything. He later reported the incident.</p>
<p>The detective received the report and went to investigate with the Chinese and Western detectives. According to Mrs. Huang Feng, she did not want to let them stay because she saw that there were guns in their luggage, so they left.</p>
<p>She did not know the name of the worker-like person but said that the child was studying at Jiannan Middle School at 33 Wuding Road. She then led the detectives to Jiannan Middle School, where Ge Wencheng was arrested.</p>
<p>Regarding the various pieces of evidence, according to Ge, the guns were hidden at 1592 Hede Road. The detectives went with Ge to the room of the second defendant, Peng Zijie, on the second floor of the house. Ge first opened the rattan suitcase he had deposited.</p>
<p>Inside, they found a Mauser pistol, ten rounds of live ammunition, and a pistol,</p>
<p>Three rounds of live ammunition. Peng and the third defendant, Huang Peng, were both in the room at the time, so they were arrested together. In addition, they also found a large number of printed materials and books. Among them were three small pieces of paper with the number of guns received written on them, and a letter containing Communist texts, as well as a manuscript</p>
<p>Studying the text of Indian Gandhiism. Among the books, there is one entitled Guangzhou Riot No., which is the most noteworthy. The rest of the items need not be explained one by one, please inspect them by the court. In short, the books obtained are mostly</p>
<p>Marxist readings, the above are all about the material evidence,</p>
<p>Huang Peng was a previous offender, as for the witness, Ge Wencheng</p>
<p>Can prove that the deceased was his adoptive father, the 8th morning, the death</p>
<p>The deceased carried a pistol out of his residence at 587 Haifang Road</p>
<p>Shortly after returning to his residence, he hid the gun, reappeared empty-handed, and was shot and killed on Beijing Road. According to Ge, the worker-like person was a friend of the deceased.</p>
<p>Is the third defendant Huang Peng was arrested, but he denied that he also lived in the house, but according to the police investigation, Huang</p>
<p>The detective is now going to search the pavilion again, and Huang was previously arrested and sent to the court for distributing leaflets.</p>
<p>Arrested and sent to the hospital, fined 15 yuan, his name was Peng Nayun at the time, and the west detective's report was followed by the west detective Pibu's report on the search situation on Hede Road, saying that the third defendant Huang Peng</p>
<p>At that time, he said that he had just come to Shanghai from Nanjing and stayed at a university in Jiangwan. All the items seized, except for the guns and bullets, were found in Ge's rattan box, and the rest were found in Peng's writing desk and drawer. The student dormitory of Jiannan Middle School is at 36 Wuding Road. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00, I went to search and copied books against Japanese imperialism. The principal of the school is Huang Fengshi's husband. He has not been arrested yet, and the students in the boarding room have all been moved, etc.</p>
<p>Pistol Suddenly Fell to the Ground, Second, the rickshaw puller Wang Asan testified that the person who hired his vehicle was an adult and was taken by Ge, and when pushed to the door of Huang Fengshi's house on Avenue Road, a pistol fell out of the schoolbag, Ge Hai went to knock on the door, and Huang Fengshi opened the door, Ge Hai first gave me two cents for the fare,</p>
<p>And the woman added two corners, telling the car not to speak out, and then I reported to the bao detective.</p>
<p>Huang Feng's Statement also stated that the woman Huang Feng was 27 years old. She was from Chongqing, Sichuan. She had been in Shanghai for more than a year. Her husband, Huang Cheng, was 28 years old. He was a professor at a university in the previous semester and was unemployed at home this semester. Ge's mother was from my hometown on the 26th of last month. Ge's mother returned to her hometown and entrusted me to take care of her son. Yesterday, Ge came to knock on the door, and I saw the car driver was arguing, so I added two cents to the car driver.</p>
<p>Don't reveal the pistol, because I am afraid that Ge will be blamed, and I will not allow Ge to carry this dangerous item.</p>
<p>The tailor recounted all kinds of things, and Guo Zhengji, the landlord of the second room at Chong'anli 587 Haifang Road, testified that Ge's father came to rent the pavilion alone in the first month. He said that he was from Hunan and sent letters in the exchange. His wife was hired by someone and his son was in school</p>
<p>Reading, I saw that he was about 30 years old, sometimes dressed in long clothes, sometimes dressed in short clothes, and after renting, a woman came once, and his son Ge Wencheng came several times. Yesterday, Ge and another person came again.</p>
<p>He said that his father fell and injured on the road and had been sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>So he took away his luggage. Because he didn't owe any rent, he moved it, etc.</p>
<p>Ge Tong didn't know his age, so Song Tingchang ordered the defendant Ge Wencheng to come over, and saw that he was a child, so he ordered Hu Gu to stand down.</p>
<p>He was first asked about his age. He couldn't even find out his age. He first said he was 16 years old, then said he was born in the Republic of China in 6 years, and he couldn't even know his zodiac sign. Then he said that his mother told him that he was born in 6 years, and his father told him to say he was 16 years old. The deceased's name was Liu Yiqing. He was his stepfather. His mother had already returned to her hometown and entrusted him to Huang Feng. According to a worker, a friend of his stepfather, he worked in Shanghai West. He once asked what</p>
<p>What kind of work he did, the worker refused to tell him, and his stepfather was shot and killed, and the worker came to report and helped clean up everything. When he rolled up the bed, he saw a gun hidden under the pillow. Then he transported the luggage to Huang Feng's house. The gun was suddenly leaked out, so he hired another vehicle to transport it to Peng's house, and the fare was paid by the worker.</p>
<p>Peng was an acquaintance from school, and the detectives went to Peng's house to search. A shorter gun was found in the rattan box. This gun was seen before, etc.</p>
<p>Peng Zijie's statement also stated</p>
<p>At the age of 27, he is from Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, and has been in Shanghai for almost two years. He is currently a professor of philosophy at Qunzhi University. Only my wife and I live in Shanghai. Huang Peng was my student when I was a middle school teacher in my hometown. He has just come from Nanjing to visit me, and it should be to study</p>
<p>When asked about the various printed materials and books seized by the court,</p>
<p>And more than a dozen large and small seals, whose property they are, Peng Duowei claimed to be the property of others, but did not detail the owner, only saying that they were all the property of the Wang family. He didn't know where the Wang family was, and the rest of the words were ambiguous.</p>
<p>Huang Peng went to Shanghai to visit his teacher, and then according to Huang Peng's confession,</p>
<p>At the age of 21, he is from Yichun County, Gan, and is currently studying at Nanjing Cultural College. He took advantage of the spring break to travel to Hangzhou and passed through Shanghai.</p>
<p>He heard that his teacher in middle school was in Shanghai, so he went to visit and</p>
<p>Please show the books that should be read about philosophy, and I have not committed any crimes before, nor do I have any other names, etc.</p>
<p>All three defendants were taken back into custody, and the police lawyer immediately spoke</p>
<p>Ming, regarding the fact that Huang Peng had previously committed a crime, was found from the fingerprints left in the police station. It was getting late at this time, and Song Tingchang ordered the date to be changed for further interrogation.

<p>Hu Chaosheng, the head of the waiters at the Huizhong Western Restaurant, whose home address is No. 358 Pike Road, had a nine-year-old son named Guan Xiong, who was studying at the Wushi School in Zhabei. On the afternoon of the 24th of last month, at around 4 PM, Guan Xiong was suddenly kidnapped and hidden. A letter was sent to Hu's family, intending to extort four thousand dollars. Subsequently, Chief Detective Feng Baishun of the General Inspectorate of the General Patrol House, detectives Jin Yangwu, Ma Xiaozhi, and others successively captured the kidnappers Chen Kangsheng, Zhu Guoliang (aka Li Fusheng), Qian Yiqing (aka Wang Asheng), Shi Maoni, and four others in places like Peng Road and Room 45 of the Daxin Hotel on Fuzhou Road. The hostage, Hu Guanxiong, was rescued and escorted to the court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Yuan, together with Chief Prosecutor Zhou Xianjue, ascended to the second criminal court of the Special District Court. The patrol房 lawyer Ru Baoyi stood up and presented the case,</p>
<p>and stated that according to the confession of the first defendant, Chen Kangsheng, Qian Yiqing was the principal offender in this case. Furthermore, a few days ago, Qian said to Chen in the patrol房 prison, "You must not accuse me in court, otherwise, I will hire a lawyer to have you shot. If you agree, I will also hire a lawyer to defend you, and you may be released." This statement can be testified to by Zhang Jinrong, a thief who was detained in the same cell as Chen, and Wang Zongxiang, an arsonist. The two criminals, Zhang and Wang, have also been brought to the case, etc. Subsequently, the defendant Chen Kangsheng confessed that he was a worker in the lead printing department of the Commercial Press. On the 20th of last month,</p>
<p>he met Qian Yiqing at Touji Bridge. After talking, they went to the Land of Immortals to play. Qian then entrusted me to find a way to lure out the plaintiff's son. I was fooled for a moment, so on the 24th, I lured Guan Xiong out. He stayed at my place for two nights. Because I was short of money, Qian gave me fifty yuan to open a hotel room and for playing with the hostage. So I opened Room 20 of the Fushan Hotel and stayed for one night. Because the hotel room was small and had a lot of bedbugs, I moved to Room 45 of the Daxin Hotel the next day. After being arrested, I was detained in the small prison of the Zhabei patrol房. On the 29th, at 7 AM, Qian Yiqing, because he was detained in the large cell next door, shouted my name. At that time, it happened to be heard by the translator in the writing room, who forbade him to speak. Qian was silent. At 7 AM the next morning, Qian shouted to me again, saying, "You must admit it in court and not accuse me, otherwise, I will definitely hire a lawyer to have you shot." At that time, there were five other criminals detained with me. This matter was planned by Qian,</p>
<p>I was fooled by him. As for Zhu Guoliang, he discussed and contacted Qian after the incident, etc. When questioned, Zhu Guoliang confessed that he also worked in the lead printing department of the Commercial Press and did not know Chen or Qian,</p>
<p>nor did he have any grudges. This time, I was falsely accused. Qian Yiqing confessed,</p>
<p>"According to Chen, I contacted the plaintiff on the 26th, but on that day, I went to the Yixing District Party Headquarters to discuss the opening of a hospital and stayed there. I did not return to Shanghai by car until 10 PM on the 28th and went straight to the Daxin Hotel to find a friend.</p>
<p>I was arrested by detectives as soon as I stepped onto the escalator. As for in the patrol房 prison, I did say to Chen, 'I have no grudges against you, why did you falsely accuse me?'" When Shi Maoni was questioned, her confession was ambiguous. Finally, the criminals Wang Zongxiang and Zhang Jinrong were brought to the case to prove that Qian did say to Chen in prison, "Don't accuse me,</p>
<p>otherwise, I will hire a lawyer to have you shot," etc. After Judge Sun verified the confession,</p>
<p>because it was past noon, he ordered the defendants to be detained and postponed the hearing to Monday afternoon next week.</p>

<p>Wenhui News reported that Stevenson, the second mate of the Yihua Yixing Steamship Company, now plans to circumnavigate the globe in a wooden sailboat named the Maxky, which was specially built and is currently docked in Shantou. Mr. Stevenson went to Hong Kong on the Yixing Steamship last week and then went to Shantou.</p>
<p>He will set sail on the boat at the end of this week or the beginning of next week,</p>

<h3 id="e168">Telephone Installation in Meilong Town Pending <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Meilong Town in this city is located in western Shanghai and is the western gateway to the urban area, which is extremely important for defense. Moreover, it is still six miles away from Caohejing Town. Once there is an alarm, the response is slow. Therefore, the local people are eager to have company telephones installed. Convenient communications are not only beneficial to defense but also greatly beneficial to the development of the commercial market. The Second Direct District Branch of the Municipal Executive Committee in that area, in view of this, submitted a request to the Secretariat of the Municipal Executive Committee in February of this year, which was forwarded to the Municipal Public Works Bureau,</p>
<p>requesting that telephones be installed for public use. The bureau immediately forwarded the request to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau for verification. It is now known that after the Telephone Bureau's survey, the town is located far away and requires 200 telephone poles. In addition to borrowing telegraph poles, 20 poles need to be planted,</p>
<p>costing 600 yuan, and five measures are proposed: (1) This line</p>
<p>must wait until the components of the West Branch Bureau are installed before a solution can be found. (2) Whether the telegraph poles can be borrowed must be agreed upon by the Telegraph Bureau. (3) There must be reputable shops in the town willing to be responsible for acting as retailers of telephones, and the method of communication can be negotiated with the bureau. (4) How much of the construction cost can the town contribute? (5) The bureau can provide considerable remuneration for acting as a public telephone. There are still many problems with the installation of telephones in Meilong Town, and it is difficult to achieve it in the short term.</p>

<p>Signed a Contract to Build a Wharf</p>
<p>The Industry to Undertake the Construction Costs</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau originally planned to operate a ferry between the Muddy River Crossing in Pudong and the Shiliupu in Puxi, and decided to use the Shiliupu manure removal wharf as the ferry terminal. Subsequently, the Fruit Industry Association, Shixingtang, also</p>
<p>requested to lease the site to build a fruit boat wharf. The five bureaus of Finance, Public Works, Land, Health, and Public Works jointly decided that after the manure removal wharf was relocated, the entire site would be managed by the Public Works Bureau to build the municipal ferry construction wharf. All the remaining parts that do not conflict with the municipal ferry would be designated by the Public Works Bureau and distributed to the industry for use. The cost of the ferry terminal construction would be borne by the industry. After the Public Works Bureau estimated and repeatedly discussed, it was set at 5,000 taels. Later, the industry requested to change the regulations and build a floating bridge along the shoreline. The Public Works Bureau allowed this and simultaneously proposed that all the wharves and the revetment within the wharf area should be entirely borne by the industry, and the association also agreed to undertake this. The Public Works Bureau then negotiated and signed a contract to build the wharf. On January 21 of this year, the bureau invited all parties concerned to discuss the draft contract. The industry representatives present had no objections to the conditions offered. The draft contract was then submitted to the municipal government for approval.</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 10th) at 2 PM, the bureau invited the industry representatives to the bureau to formally sign the contract. All the 5,000 taels for the ferry terminal construction subsidy and the 2,000 yuan for the revetment subsidy were also paid by the representative together.</p>

<p>The Zi Lin News reported that the Asiatische Gesellschaft building was built 60 years ago. It has been infested by worms and termites, and the wood is decaying. It is now beyond repair. In the past two years, it was decided to raise 100,000 taels to rebuild a new</p>
<p>building for use as a library, museum, and assembly hall. A committee was then organized to raise funds. After two years, only 750 yuan has been raised. It was not until this Monday that Mr. Gu generously donated 500 taels. Therefore, the committee was reorganized last month to actively proceed with fundraising, contacting the Public Works Bureau and various banks. According to the</p>
<p>society's purpose, it specializes in studying China and the Far East.</p>
<p>The library has 12,000 volumes, many of which are rare books. The museum is open to the public for reading. The land was allocated by the British government and is now worth 10,000 pounds. If funding is sufficient for the new building plan,</p>
<p>it is planned to build a five-story building. In addition to serving as a library, museum, assembly hall, art gallery, and document and book storage rooms, the rest will be rented out.</p>

<p>Please Restore Traffic on Hankou Road</p>
<p>Affecting Business Operations on the Road</p>
<p>The Commercial and Political Committee sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau yesterday, requesting the restoration of traffic on Hankou Road, stating, "On the 10th of this month, we received a joint letter from the businesses on Hankou Road stating that since the Public Works Bureau designated Hankou Road traffic as one-way from April 1, the movement of vehicles has been restricted, and the business operations on this road have been greatly reduced. Moreover, the one-way rule is from 8:00 AM to 9:30 AM and from 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM, from west to east, and from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM and from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM, from east to west. However, this</p>
<p>time coincides with the time when the Public Works Bureau staff go to and from the office, so this measure is actually for the convenience of the Public Works Bureau staff and not for the convenience of citizens and travelers. We should request your committee to negotiate and achieve the purpose of cancellation,</p>
<p>to protect the commercial safety of this road," etc., was received by the committee. According to the businesses, the Public Works Bureau's designation of Hankou Road traffic as one-way is only convenient for the Bureau staff to travel within the specified time and has no relation to the traffic of the entire city. On the contrary, the business operations on the road have been affected by this.</p>
<p>Therefore, this measure is not necessary for public transportation and is detrimental to business</p>
<p>operations. According to the principle of municipal facilities serving the welfare of the majority of citizens, we propose that your bureau abolish the method of changing Hankou Road traffic to one-way, so as to comply with public opinion and to maintain public friendship. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement.</p>

<p>The Public Works Bureau has included funding for filling ponds and ditches in this year's budget, totaling 44,000 taels of silver. This project must be started immediately. The middle section of the canal from Avenue Edward VII to Suzhou Creek is now marked with multiple wooden signs, announcing to nearby residents that this canal will be filled in. After the project is completed, this unsanitary and unsightly canal will be eliminated. It is estimated that 1.6 mu of land can be added to the Xinzha warehouse area, and the land price from the sale of this land in the future</p>
<p>can largely offset the expenses incurred.</p>

<p>In recent days, reactionary leaflets have been found from time to time on the outer Ma Road and railway station in Wusong. Therefore, the Seventh District Public Security Bureau and the First Chief of the Seventh District Police Station are paying close attention. At around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, three students were distributing leaflets near the Huafeng Yarn Factory when they were spotted by patrolling police. As the police were about to step forward to arrest them,</p>
<p>the students immediately ran away quickly. The police chased after them, blowing their whistles wildly. At that time, it happened to be the time when the Yong'an and Huafeng Yarn Factories were letting out workers, and there were many workers coming and going. The female workers were panicked because they did not know the reason and fled in droves. The students fled to the east side of the Huafeng Factory and then turned north into a small road. They did not know that the road turned east and was the location of the First Police Station of the Seventh District. At that time, the chiefs and police officers of the station heard the sound of the whistles and came out to investigate, seeing three people running straight towards them. They stepped forward to intercept them,</p>
<p>and seized more than 100 reactionary leaflets in red, green, and yellow.</p>
<p>Chief Zhang Jiguang interrogated the students, who identified themselves as Zhou Jue, 19 years old, from Hunan, Liu Cong, 18 years old, from Changzhou, and Liang Hongqing, 19 years old, from Jiangxi. All three were students at Tongji University. All denied distributing leaflets. After a brief interrogation by Chief Zhang, they were immediately transferred to the Third Branch of the Judiciary. After a preliminary interrogation by Section Chief Chen, because it was related to politics, a document was prepared and sent to the Judicial Section of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for interrogation and verification.</p>

<p>Chen Ding's Addiction to Flower Gambling</p>
<p>Pledge Ticket Shows Determination</p>
<p>Chen Ding, a Ningbo woman who used to live in Dexing Lane, North Zhejiang Road,</p>
<p>was nearly forty years old. Her husband died, leaving behind a son who was being raised at his maternal grandparents' home in Hongkou. Chen was friendly with Zhao Qin Huai and his wife in the same lane and often said to Zhao that she had more than a thousand yuan from uncollected gambling debts, which she would entrust to Zhao to invest at high</p>
<p>interest rates. However, Chen was addicted to gambling, especially flower gambling, which left her penniless. She had borrowed more than a hundred yuan at high interest rates from Zhao, which she had not repaid. Later, she continued to ask Zhao's wife to borrow fifty yuan (at an interest rate of 2,500 cash per day). Zhao was happy to help because he believed that Chen had more than a thousand yuan of uncollected gambling debts to rely on. Who knew that Chen would disappear without a trace. Zhao and his wife searched everywhere but could not find her. Unexpectedly, Zhao suddenly encountered Chen on a trolleybus on the 18th Road the other day.</p>
<p>It was indeed an enemy meeting on a narrow road. Chen said to Zhao that she was going to Ningbo for business</p>
<p>and was now planning to come to settle the debt. They went together to Zhao's home, where they calculated that she owed more than four hundred yuan in principal and interest. She promised to go with him to her mother's house the next day to get the money and then stayed at Zhao's house. Zhao believed</p>
<p>it to be true. Unexpectedly, Chen opened the door and fled in the middle of the night. When Zhao and his wife woke up, she was already gone like a yellow crane. The next day, Zhao went to Chen's mother's</p>
<p>house and asked. Chen's brother said that he had already repaid more than a thousand yuan on Chen's behalf, because she</p>
<p>had not changed her gambling habits and had already declared a break in relations. Zhao could not force him and had to go home. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the same day, Zhao received a letter sent by Chen Ding by mail, along with a pledge ticket. The letter said that she had now pledged six or seventy yuan and was going to make a final attempt to win a jackpot at the French Concession flower gambling den. Please inquire and see if it would land on the intended number. If so, both of them would benefit. If heaven does not bless me, I will have to throw myself into the Huangpu River to repay you in the next life. Please send the pledge ticket to a certain place, as it was borrowed jewelry pledged for money to use as capital. Zhao and his wife were shocked and angry when they saw the letter and are now searching everywhere and reporting the letter to Chen's mother's house.</p>

<p>Yang Kunlin, a carbide worker at the Yufa Chang Machine Factory at No. 23 O'Galou, was working with his colleague Ni Laofu on the morning of the other day when the electricity inside the carbide lamp was too strong, causing the small iron cylinder inside to pop out and strike Yang in the face, causing serious injuries.</p>
<p>As a result, he died. The Harbin patrol房 learned of this and ordered detectives to send Yang's body to the coroner's office on Ferron Road for examination. Yesterday morning, the Special District Local Court appointed Prosecutor Guo Wei to visit the office to examine the body and ascended to the public seat. According to Ni Laofu's report, the factory owner Yuan A'er, from Wuxi, also reported that Yang was indeed a worker in his factory, but according to regulations, he should have brought the work home and should not have worked in the factory, so he could not be held responsible for compensation.</p>
<p>Yang Zhang, the deceased's wife, said, "My husband's work can only be done in the factory, because our home only has small machines, and the large machines are only in the factory. I request that the factory be ordered to pay appropriate compensation." Prosecutor Guo obtained the confession and ruled, "It is verified that the deceased Yang Kunlin died from being struck by an electrical cylinder. His wife, Yang Zhang, is ordered to provide a guarantee to claim the body for burial, and the factory is ordered to provide compensation."</p>

<p>The meat merchants of Zhouxiangtai and others in Xujiahui Town, West Shanghai, specifically requested the Health Bureau to establish a public slaughter company in the town for the convenience of inspection, and repeatedly requested the installation of water pipes, but this was not done. Yesterday, they specifically sent a letter to the Town Business Association requesting that it be forwarded to the Health Bureau, stating, "Since the meat merchants in West Shanghai (Xujiahui Caohejing Longhua) have been concentrated in this slaughterhouse and inspection after slaughter has been implemented, the number of slaughtered animals has gradually increased daily, and the relationship between water usage is important. Businessmen have repeatedly requested installation of water pipes, but they have not been installed. If river water is used, the Zhaojia Bang River will become increasingly clogged, and the water in the river is not only black and smelly, but sometimes it is difficult to find a drop of water. There is no other place to take water from. Although we are forced to use sewage, it is extremely unsanitary. If we need to dig an artesian well, there is no location or funding, and the difficult situation has reached its extreme. We are specifically requesting that your association promptly forward the request for immediate relief measures to maintain business and emphasize sanitation."</p>

<p>The Plaintiff Lost in the First Instance</p>
<p>The Appeal Has Concluded Its Arguments</p>
<p>Zhang Jinbao and her sister, Zhang Gennan, women from this county, previously hired a lawyer in the Provisional Court to file a civil lawsuit against their stepmother, Zhang Pu, for not dividing their deceased father's estate. After a preliminary hearing, the plaintiff lost the case. Zhang Jinbao and others, dissatisfied with the first instance judgment, hired a lawyer to file an appeal. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, Hu Yigu, the Presiding Judge of the Civil Division of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, along with Judges Han Zuzhi and Ye Zaiyi, ascended to the court to hold a hearing. Both parties arrived with their lawyers. Zhang Jinbao stated, "I am a local, 27 years old, and live on Yidingpan Road.</p>
<p>I am engaged, but not yet married. My father's name is Yu Sun, and my biological mother, Lu, died many years ago. She had two daughters. The appellant Zhang Pu is my stepmother and has two sons. My father passed away in 1925, leaving behind land and other property worth approximately 60,000 to 70,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Although my stepmother gave me 1,000 yuan for dowry last year, my sisters and I want to divide the family property equally with the two brothers, and my wardrobe and other belongings have been embezzled. I am currently living with my maternal grandmother in Chadaikou, and</p>
<p>my livelihood is also uncertain." The appellant Zhang Pu stated, "I am a local, 33 years old, and live at No. 502 at the end of Maigen Road. I have been married to Zhang Yu Sun for nine years and have two sons, one eight years old and the other six years old. My husband died in 1925, leaving behind more than 130 mu of rice fields in Lujia Bang, Kunshan, and six or seven mu of real estate in Shanghai, totaling approximately 12,000 to 20,000 yuan, which I manage. However, all of Yu Sun's previous wife's jewelry is held by Jinbao. Last year, Jinbao wanted to get married and asked me for money, so I gave her 1,200 yuan. However, after receiving the money, she filed a lawsuit. As for the second daughter, Gennan, if she still recognizes me as her mother,</p>
<p>I am willing to raise her. When she gets married in the future, I will give her dowry money. Moreover, my two sons are still young and cannot divide the family property equally," etc. After the arguments by the lawyers of both parties, Judge Hu ruled that the arguments in this case were concluded and the verdict would be announced on April 16.</p>

<p>Zhang, an old woman from Qingpu, 58 years old this year, went alone to the Hexing Inn at No. 52 Mintini Road, French Concession, on the evening of the 9th to borrow a bed. For some unknown reason, she suddenly had a negative thought and committed suicide by swallowing raw opium. It was not until she moaned in pain from the poison that</p>
<p>Yu Shaofu, the teahouse waiter at the inn, learned of it. He immediately reported it to the Songshan Road patrol房 and ordered detectives to send her by car to Renji Hospital. However, the poison in her abdomen was too deep, and the rescue was ineffective. She died yesterday morning. The hospital notified the patrol房, who sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall coroner's office. There were no family members found. The patrol房 reported it to French Concession Judge Zhu Cheng at noon to examine the body. The judge confirmed that the deceased died from taking poison before death and ordered that photos be taken. The remains were collected and buried by the hall, awaiting family members to claim them.</p>

<p>Seamen's General Union, Reorganization Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Industrial United General Union: Yesterday, a notice was issued to all levels of the union regarding the assassination of Hong Zhaolin by sailor Wei De, stating that according to a report from the union secretary Liu Yuzhou, "Upon investigation, on December 7th of the 14th year of the Republic of China, sailor Wei De shot and killed the rebel general of the Chen army, Hong Zhaolin, and then committed suicide. Considering his premeditation and accurate execution, he can be considered wise. Considering his willingness to commit suicide to avoid implication, he can be considered benevolent. Considering his determination to kill the enemy and disregard his own safety, he can be considered brave. One act embodies three virtues, one deed is sufficient for eternity, and he is truly rare among revolutionaries in recent times. I believe that a person of public loyalty and righteousness like Martyr Wei should have this day designated as Martyr Wei De's Day of Sacrifice, and request the central government to approve and order the relevant departments to hold commemorative events to honor the martyrs and encourage those who come after." A brief history of Martyr Wei, a commemorative ceremony, and key points for propaganda have been compiled in one copy. Based on this, the union has resolved to order compliance, and commemorative meetings should be held every year thereafter</p>
<p>to comfort the loyal souls and encourage others. This is of utmost importance. The above is a notice to all union departments.</p>

<h3 id="e187">The West Lake of the Future <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qian</p>
<p>I once heard a revolutionary party member angrily say, "West Lake must be filled in!" Presumably, someone engaged in revolution loved to visit West Lake, neglecting their duties, which provoked this angry remark. Furthermore, I often hear people describe West Lake as intoxicating. In reality, this is not only insufficient to describe West Lake, but also insults it.</p>
<p>West Lake's beauty has its own unique aspects. It's not a matter of whether it intoxicates or not. In my opinion, since West Lake existed, there must have been people who visited it and failed to fully describe its beauty, but exclaimed, "West Lake is intoxicating!" As a result, West Lake has been mistakenly regarded by some as only capable of intoxicating.</p>
<p>On April 1st of this year, the National Congress of the Three Principles of the People was held on the shores of West Lake. I immediately felt a strong and heroic atmosphere filling the beautiful scenery, which could shake the minds of those who love to make noise, those who are intoxicated year-round, and those who have the despairing notion of living in a drunken dream, and dispel their absurd notion that West Lake is intoxicating.</p>
<p>From now on, I hope that those who visit West Lake will no longer be misled by the idea of intoxication and pretend to be elegant by getting drunk. I hope that those who visit West Lake will see the clear ripples and imagine the purity and health of the athletes, and understand that sports can lead to strength. See the towering Twin Peaks and imagine the tall and long-lived athletes, imagine the athletes' spirit full of beauty, and understand that sports are the fundamental art of achieving beauty. Only in this way can one live up to West Lake and avoid a meaningless visit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one can deeply understand the ultimate meaning of holding the first National Congress of the Three Principles of the People in West Lake.</p>
<p>When the author submitted this article to Free Talk, he deeply wished that the people of the country would understand the importance of sports in the future and achieve the goals of freedom and equality through this. Then, those who visit the lake in the future may recall my humble self because of Free Talk. A smile.</p>

<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>Stealing leisure from a busy schedule, I returned home for ten days. I recorded a few of the more interesting things I heard and saw.</p>
<p>As follows:</p>
<p>Gu Heyi, the painting master, is as famous as the late Lu Lianfu for his landscapes. The price of his paintings is several times higher than Lu's. Often, even a small fan or album leaf costs forty or fifty gold. Even those who offer high commissions and seek his work cannot obtain it without repeated requests.</p>
<p>This is because he has many unfinished pieces and sometimes makes forgeries of ancient works, selling them for hundreds or thousands of gold, which is not uncommon. Therefore, instead of creating his own works, he would rather create ancient works, sell them for a good price, and then profit from them. Unexpectedly, he suddenly suffered a stroke last month. With the help of medicine, he managed to survive.</p>
<p>However, he is now paralyzed and can no longer engage in painting. What a pity.</p>
<p>In the past, there was a seller of Zhuangyuan cakes. He was originally from a noble family, lost his fortune to a courtesan named Jin Feng, and became addicted to opium, eventually becoming a humble vendor. He also loved alcohol, and after drinking, he would often tell people about his past romantic affairs, which listeners used as a laughingstock. This spring, he suddenly fell ill and died in his sleep. His remains were collected by the famous painter Wu Zishen, which was truly a meritorious act.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Random Notes on Reading Paintings at Qingfeng Mingyue Cottage <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Mei Xue</p>
<p>Qingfeng Mingyue Cottage is the residence of Mr. Xu Qianfu on Avenue Road in the French Concession of Shanghai. My friend Shen Shijia recently came from the West Lake and lives here. My old friend Wang Qianlou also came to Shanghai, both responding to the demands of Shanghai residents and making a living through painting. Qianfu is a refined scholar, so he is happy to recruit them.</p>
<p>However, Qianlou has another residence and only comes here occasionally to paint.</p>
<p>Last Sunday "April 6th," I visited Qianfu's residence at 2:00 PM to visit Shijia for a half-day chat. Qianlou also happened to be there. Both gentlemen are skilled in landscape painting. On that day, I saw screens, wall hangings, square paintings, and horizontal scrolls on display, almost covering all the famous mountains and rivers, giving a sense of being detached from the world. Finally, each showed me a small painting. Qianlou painted pine trees and inscribed them with my nickname. The bark was weathered, the branches strong,</p>
<p>resembling a thousand-year-old tree. How could I surpass it? Shijia painted a landscape with a sense of openness that struck my brow, and he inscribed a five-character poem expressing his deep feelings. He was especially able to move between Tao Yuanming and Han Yu. His poem said, "Where does the clear whistle sound? Gazing afar at the deep woods. Above the desolate stream and green clouds, the sounds of luan and phoenix are faint. Grass and stones have no names, and the rocks and springs are also silent. May I ask what year is this? The heavens are drunk and have not yet awakened." I was immersed in it, reluctant to let go. Qianlou suddenly asked, "Who is Meng Yu? Is he your friend?" I said, "Yes, so why are you teasing me so much?" Then he took out Meng Yu's article "Colorful Phoenixes Fly to the West" from the Free Talk of that day and pointed it out, saying, "This article mentions Miss Mei Qu and her son Yunhua. Meng Yu probably thinks that your daughter has a masculine air, so he doesn't call her a daughter but a son. He must also think that you don't have a masculine air, so he calls you a lady." Everyone laughed. I said,</p>
<p>"If Meng Yu didn't make this bad joke, it must be a mistake by the typesetter. It's just a coincidence. However, I am willing to exchange my hairpin and hat with my daughter and deeply thank the typesetter for resolving this dispute." Everyone asked, "Is there an explanation?" I said, "Yes. My daughter's name is Yunhua, and I have another female disciple named Yunhua, also surnamed Wang. They both study painting and have different approaches. Three years ago, Meng Yu, the editor of Camel Painting News, made a statement</p>
<p>saying, "Wang Yunhua of Wu, the female disciple of Mei Qu, and Wang Yunhua of Lingnan, the daughter of Mei Qu." However, those who see their works in Shanghai and Hangzhou still suspect that they are counterfeit copies. Mr. and Mrs. Xu Shiqi invited us to dinner the other day and suspected that my daughter, who usually studies Western painting, was the one who paints female figures. Mrs. Xu, Yang Manhua, suspected it even more.</p>
<p>Now that the typesetter made a mistake and my daughter exchanged her hairpin for a hat, it can be known that she is definitely not Yunhua of Wu, who paints landscapes. As for the aging Mei Qu, it doesn't matter whether you call him a horse or a cow." Everyone was smiling. A guest came to visit and asked what school Shijia's painting belonged to. Qianfu replied,</p>
<p>"His painting style is thick and has a scholarly air. He has worked hard on the styles of Yuan Shanjiao and Tao Dachai, and his source comes from the Four Wangs. He is able to avoid being restricted by the Four Wangs." The guest nodded. I was also fortunate to hear the secrets of the painter. I hastily wrote this as random notes on reading paintings.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Newspaper Quilt <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>Newspapers are a medium for advertising and news. After reading them, except for a few literati who keep them, people usually use them to wrap copper coins or paste them on walls. I have never heard of them being used for other purposes. However, a certain Feng in Huaiyin actually made a quilt out of newspapers to protect his body temperature, which is truly unexpected.</p>
<p>Feng is over seventy years old and extremely poor, but he is addicted to reading this newspaper. He has no possessions, but he has accumulated decades' worth of newspapers. The newspaper can only be used to impart knowledge, not to make money. When Feng sleeps, he only has a single thin quilt to cover himself. Last winter, the weather was extremely cold. Feng was attacked by the cold and his body was as cold as iron. He had a strange idea. He took out the old newspapers from the shelf and spread them out. He glued each sheet together, making several sheets. The length and width were similar to his body. Then he pasted over a hundred sheets in the same way, stacked them in a pile, and connected them with thread. When it was finished, it was no different from a quilt. Feng took it and wrapped it around his body. It was much warmer than covering himself with a single thin quilt.</p>
<p>Feng told people the other day that he had been using this quilt for several months.</p>
<p>The parts that touch the body feel a little unclean. Just tear off a layer, and it will be clean again. In the spring, the weather changed from extremely cold to warm.</p>
<p>The layers of my quilt were torn off one by one, changing from thick to thin. It doesn't need to be washed, and it's suitable for the weather. Poor scholars of the world,</p>
<p>if you can follow my example, then those cotton wads and quilts</p>
<p>will be useless.</p>
<p>The above facts were told to me by my friend Huang Yinmin.</p>
<p>This newspaper has opened up a new use. This strange and interesting event is truly amusing.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Anecdotes of Red Apricots <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The warm air is quietly urging the new blossoms of apricot flowers. This is truly a great adornment of spring. The flowers and leaves of the apricot are similar to those of the plum. It is a deciduous small tree. The fruit is yellow and ripe, sweet but not sour. The kernels can be mashed into juice.</p>
<p>It can treat coughs. This is why the ancients had the saying, "Don't say that the fruit is for people to eat, the broken kernels can still be used as medicine." Miscellaneous Records of Youyang: Southeast of Jinan County, there is Fenliu Mountain, which has many apricots, as large as pears and as yellow as oranges, called Hanwu Apricots. However, when asked about it, the people of Lu all said they had never heard of it. Presumably, the fine variety has long been extinct. The method of planting apricots is to bury the kernels with the flesh in manure soil and transplant them in the spring. Otherwise, the fruit will be small and bitter. It is best to plant them near people's homes and not too densely. If they are too dense, the flowers will be sparse and the fruit will be few. Gardeners must know this.</p>
<p>My fellow student Jin Jihe's respected father, He Wangzhang, has been a sojourner in Wu for many years. He lives in Mr. Fei Weizhai's house, which has a red apricot tree that is tall, beautiful, and pleasing. In the past, during the flowering season, Zhang moved to Xinqiao Lane. However, because the red apricots were so beautiful, he could not move them together with his zither, wine, books, and paintings. He was quite regretful about this. The calligrapher and painter Bi Xungu knew this,</p>
<p>so he painted a large branch of apricot blossoms and named it "The Marrying Apricot Picture" as a gift. Zhang wrote a long poem about it, which was passed down as a beautiful story for a time. According to "The Marrying Apricot,"</p>
<p>it has been around since ancient times. Miscellaneous Records of Wenchang: The apricot tree in front of Li Guanqing's hall had many flowers but no fruit. A matchmaker smiled and said, "Next spring, I will marry this apricot." In the depth of winter, she suddenly brought wine and asked for a virgin's skirt to tie to the tree, offered a blessing, and left. The following spring, it bore countless fruits. This story is almost absurd and is only for amusement.</p>
<p>Zhang Yunhe, a famous painter in Shanghai, lived with his patron, Dan Jinyu. Because I was familiar with Zhang, I asked him to paint a picture of apricot forest spring swallows. After it was completed, Zhang suddenly discovered that in the midst of the dense flowers, the fluttering swallows</p>
<p>were exactly eight in number. Fearing that he would be laughed at by vulgar people, he remade a painting to replace it. I took it back, but Dan Jinyu was not offended by the eight swallows and kept it carefully. As a result, I also managed to seize one of them.</p>
<p>I was quite fortunate about it.</p>
<p>In Western restaurants, there is a dish called almond tofu, which is made with almonds in tofu, mixed with sugar syrup, and stored in the refrigerator. It is sweet and delicious and is a good product for cooling off in the summer.</p>
<p>Good stories of apricots are often seen in ancient books, such as Confucius resting on the apricot altar, and Dong Feng living in Mount Lu, treating people for illnesses, planting five apricot trees for serious cases and one tree for minor cases, known as Dong Xian's Apricot Forest. Also, Guo Ziyi crossed the river from Apricot Garden to surround Weizhou, with the Apricot Garden crossing site.</p>
<p>Also, Song Qi had the line "Red apricot branch head spring meaning riot," and was then called Red Apricot Secretary. Also, the immortal Liu Gen hid in Apricot Mountain, and the Shanglin Garden had Penglai Apricots, which were offered by Dong Hai Duwei Yu Ji.</p>
<p>Good poems about apricots include "Drunk in the jade building under apricot flowers," "Plum blossoms have faded, apricot blossoms are new," "Selling apricot flowers in deep alleys tomorrow morning," "Apricot buds like faces, half-open and fragrant," "Apricot branches leaning and flowers swaying," "Thousands of red apricot trees in front of the Wenxing Hall," "Famous gardens leaning against each other, apricot flowers blooming," "Girls pick them with care, saying it is the flower of the spring breeze and passing the exam," "Powder is thin, red is light, covering shame, occupying the limelight among flowers," "Ashamed to meet the willow eyes, three points of white, dividing the peach cheeks, a smiling red." The beauty is endless.</p>

<p>Chapter 10: The Red Flame Soars to the Sky, the Balcony Admires the Filial Daughter; the Red Carpet is Laid Out, a Famous Actor is Met on the Spot</p>
<p>But in that scene... the female lead, the prodigal lady... was driven out of her home... suffering from terminal tuberculosis... and remembering her husband... many ladies and wives in the whole theatre... were shedding tears there... even to the point of sobbing faintly... Zuo Shichen turned his head and looked at Ruiyun... whose eyes were already red... even Ah Jin was wiping her tears there... Ruiyun wasn't wiping her eyes at this moment... but just rubbing her nose with her handkerchief... Zuo Shichen said... "How is it... are you crying too... hey... this is just acting... it's not real..." Ruiyun said... "Knowing it's acting... I still feel sad for her..." As she said that... her voice was also a little choked up... Zuo Shichen said... "This is bad... I invited you to see a play... originally to find happiness... now it's causing you to shed tears... bringing on sadness... that's not good... let's not watch the following scene... let's go back..." Ruiyun said... "No... I'll watch it all and then go..." Zuo Shichen said... "The following scene... is also material for tears... it's her husband... injured in battle... in the hospital... getting news of his beloved wife... this is originally a tragedy... with no good ending... let's go back... let's save the tears for the next scene..." Zuo Shichen stood up to leave... but Ruiyun held him down with one hand... and said... "No, no... I must watch it all before I go..."</p>
<p>"The more it brings tears... the more I want to watch... is this kind of thing really happening... or is it all made up by them... to cheat people out of their tears..." Zuo Shichen held Ruiyun's hand tightly and said... "In that case, I'll teach you not to watch... so you don't get cheated out of your tears... why aren't you willing..." Ruiyun said... "I myself don't know... I just want to watch... they act so realistically... making people forget that they are acting..." At that time, it wasn't just Ruiyun who was shedding tears... seeing the sad parts... many people were shedding tears... especially those wives and ladies... It wasn't until the whole play was finished... that everyone dispersed and went home... At this time, as everyone stood up... Ah Jin suddenly remembered... and said... "Today, Anan's luck... there were probably a few round songs... Big Aunt asked people to fill in... why didn't any of the round song singers come..." "It's probably because you, Second Young Master, explained it thoroughly to Big Aunt..." Ruiyun stood up... gently stretched... and said... "That's right... I forgot too... I got dizzy watching the play... and forgot about the round songs... they really didn't come to sing..." Zuo Shichen said... "I knew they wouldn't come..." Ruiyun said... "Why not..." Zuo Shichen nodded and said... "That's why he said he wanted to come and sing that day...</p>
<p>I readily agreed with him... Let me ask you... has your assistance ever been to this place..." Ah Jin said... "Never been..." Zuo Shichen said... "Never been... I can't find this place either... even if I find it... the Indian doorman at the door won't let him in... unless he has a ticket... This theatre isn't like those old theatres... where anyone can run in... so even if they want to sing round songs... they can't run in..."</p>

<p>Gold Price Falls Below 500 Taels</p>
<p>Breaking the Brewing Stalemate</p>
<p>A Sharp Drop of 4.3 Mace</p>
<p>Market Trends Steadily Declining: Yesterday, the 10th, spot gold suddenly showed a weakening trend, breaking through the 500-tael barrier. After many days without significant changes, a sharp drop was suddenly seen. However, the fluctuation between the morning and afternoon markets was only about two taels. As for foreign exchange, there was a slight easing. The market opened lower in the Fuyu district, influenced by the lengthening of large silver bars. Subsequently, it lingered around 500 taels, but Jinan Yu Da and others sold off considerably, while Wanxingshunli was favorably positioned to buy. Afterwards, the price gradually declined.</p>
<p>A sudden drop to below 499 taels occurred. Later, Fuchang Yu Da and others rushed to sell, while Shunli Wanxing continued to buy. The market situation was extremely weak, with a tendency for a drastic fall. The general sentiment among peers was bearish. Consequently, the exchange rate further declined. The recent selling price of Japanese yen at the bank was 1.0425 taels for near-term and 1.0375 taels for forward. The final sudden drop was to between 97 taels. The price of British silver bars lengthened by one-sixteenth, and the silver price increased by one-quarter.</p>
<p>The morning opening saw a drop of 1.7 taels. The opening price for May spot gold was 499.7 taels, already down 1.7 mace. The gross price exceeded 500.0056 taels, but buyers seemed strong, while the exchange rate was flat. A Japanese bank bought forward Japanese yen at 1.04375 taels, and then sold near-term at 1.05125 taels. When the exchange rate was announced, it was 500 taels, with no change in the listed price. Internally, there was a gradual easing. British gold banks did deals at 11.25 pence for April. Anda and Banque Franco-Chinoise took in at 11.3125 pence for May. Donghui China Bank only sold forward at 1.0375 taels. There was a surge of sellers in the market, and around 10 o'clock it dropped to 98.23 taels. Later, British gold Hefeng Oriental had done deals at 11.25 pence for April. Zhejiang bought May Japanese yen at 1.04375 taels. Small buyers made up for it, so it returned to above 1.0 taels. At 10:30 it was 9.34 taels. After 11 o'clock it was still weak. Magali bought forward British gold at 11.4375 pence, and then it dropped to 98.67 taels. The noon close was 9 taels.</p>
<p>The afternoon low reached 7.1 taels. The afternoon market opened at 99 taels, then at 9.4 taels. The market situation was fairly flat, and there were few transactions among peers. Around 3 o'clock, it was suddenly heard that the Indian exchange rate had lengthened, and various parties were selling off. A sudden surge occurred, and the exchange rate became loose. British gold banks did deals at 11.3125 pence for April, and mutually did June Japanese yen at 1.04125 taels. Zhejiang took in May British gold at 11.4375 pence. Then it dropped to 98.34 taels. Continuing due to even stronger sellers, it finally fell to 97.1 taels, with a tendency for a complete collapse, falling into a state of fatigue. Then it slightly added a few coins, to around 8 taels. By the 4:30 closing, it had fallen again to 97.1 taels, a drop of 4.3 mace compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The closing price was suppressed to 14 taels zero. The highest price for the day was 500.006 taels, and the lowest price was 497.1 taels, a difference of 3.5 taels. The listed price was still 511.8 taels, estimated to be a small 12 to 13 taels. The afternoon listed price was suppressed by more than 14 taels. After logging, the replenishment was 99 taels in the morning and 97 taels in the afternoon. Goods opened early at 99.7 mace, closed at noon at 8.9 mace, 9 taels in the afternoon, and closed at 7 taels.</p>
<p>The Dalian group replenished more than 5,000 bars. There were no large-scale transactions by various firms. It is estimated that Yuanyuyong, Wanxing, and Shunli all took in, while Yu Da, Fuchang, Jinan, Yuanmaoyong, and others all sold off positions. Yuanda, Dadecheng, Kunhe,</p>

<p>Overseas telegrams indicated that the Indian exchange rate was as before. Yokohama and Kobe markets were also mediocre. As for the internal exchange rates of various banks in this port, the morning was flat, then weak, and especially weak in the afternoon. The spot gold price had already dropped, falling below the 500-tael barrier, and further falling below 498 taels. The supply from peers exceeded demand, and the market atmosphere declined. Chinese merchants and speculators sold off slightly, while the banks' appetite was average. It is estimated that 50 to 60 thousand pounds were thrown out, which were bought by Anda, Yu Ye, Banque Franco-Chinoise, Zhejiang, Dongya,</p>

Chinese gold companies sold tens of thousands of yuan, which was bought by Mitsui Sumitomo. A small number also closed positions. Joseon Industrial Bank sold off. Chinese and Japanese banks mutually opened 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Those who hedged spot gold were not very active. People's hearts turned sour. By the final closing, compared to the previous day (the 9th), the exchange rate lengthened by 0.125, the US dollar lengthened by 0.3125, and the Japanese yen dropped by 0.75.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Silver Prices Rise Again, Exchange Rates Remain Flat <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>

<h3 id="e196">First Comparison Period After Calendar Change Is Busy <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: The silver and money industry has always valued the lunar calendar. At this time, it coincided with the particularly busy third month of the lunar calendar's special comparison period. According to reason, the momentum should be unusually strong. This year, the national calendar is used, and it is designated as April. Therefore, yesterday was also the first of the busiest great comparison period. Since the change to the national calendar, it has been a creation. Looking at the prosperity of inflows and outflows, although not as good as last year, compared to the usual collection and disbursement,</p>
<p>there is a great difference. Therefore, the demand for silver loans is special, and foreign loans are also due to fewer customer routes for consumption, showing no weakness. The combination of the two resulted in an unusually busy scene.</p>
<p>Interest Rate for Silver and Foreign Currency: The supply and demand for "foreign currency interest" is relatively average, so the opening rate for interest rates is mostly appropriate. Yesterday morning it was 7.20375%, and the noon market was 7.205%, which matched the morning and noon markets of the previous day, with no stubborn actions. The "silver interest" was weaker than the previous day. The morning market was 0.03, and the noon market was 0.02, which was 0.01 less than the morning and noon markets of the previous day. The exchange settlement was still done in white, because although inflows and outflows were busy, the exchange support was active and abundant, resulting in this outcome.</p>
<p>The Auxiliary Coin Market: There was some buying appetite for Jiangnan small silver dollars in the morning, so the market price increased by 0.01, calculated as 0.619 yuan, and 4,000 yuan were traded. The noon market was even more deserted, with no one inquiring, and as a result, it still fell by 0.01, with the same price as the previous day at 0.618 yuan, and only 1,500 yuan were traded. It is heard that there were slightly more than 10,000 yuan being shipped to the inland.</p>
<p>The morning market for Guangdong small silver dollars was 0.59825 yuan, and the noon market was 0.598375 yuan. The morning market traded 165,000 yuan, and the noon market traded 75,000 yuan. Copper coins increased by 1,500 wen, calculated as 395,500 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Collection and Disbursement: Yesterday's collection and disbursement news, on the bank side, remained</p>
<p>without any special actions, while on the money house side, it seemed slightly more complicated. The collection and disbursement of silver public orders reached more than 48 million, setting a new record for this year. The collection and disbursement of exchange settlements was more than 5 million, and the collection and disbursement of remittance money from various routes was more than 1.4 million, and the collection of cash was about 1 million. The Huashang Bank collected and disbursed remittance money of 2.3 to 2.4 million, the foreign banks collected and disbursed remittance money of 1.5 to 1.6 million. The collection and disbursement of various cargo taxes and miscellaneous money was more than 8 million, special outgoing money was 1.5 million, silk outgoing money was more than 300,000, telegraphic transfer money was more than 700,000, incoming warehouse was 500,000, outgoing warehouse was 1 million, and the Japanese banks collected and disbursed various money amounts of more than 4 million, and the outgoing warehouse was 400,000.</p>
<p>The collection and disbursement of foreign currency: in the market, the opening of foreign currency exchange transactions was 1.28 million in the morning market and 900,500 in the noon market. There were no transactions of bank notes in the market in both markets, while outside the market the opening transaction was 144,000 in the morning market and 98,000 in the noon market. Also, spot foreign currency was 85,000 in the morning market and 120,000 in the noon market. New currency was 55,000 in both markets. Bank transactions were 550,000 for mutual market transactions in the morning and 600,000 for mutual market transactions in the noon market. The incoming and outgoing collection and disbursement of foreign currency accounts of various banks was more than 1.7 million, and the incoming and outgoing of banknotes was more than 1 million. Money houses collected more than 7 million in foreign public orders, collected and disbursed more than 2.2 million in foreign exchange settlements, lent out more than 800,000 in foreign currency, and small money houses transacted 600,000 to 700,000. The source of customer routes was more than 200,000 from the Yangtze River and 300,000 to 400,000 from this street. In terms of sales, the Guangdong group continued to install 300,000 in new currency, Hong Kong installed 100,000 in British foreign currency, Hankou installed 400,000 to 500,000 in spot foreign currency, and inland areas installed 150,000 in rice currency.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Tea Money on This Street Is Activated <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The tea firms in this port are approaching the Grain Rain season, and new tea is being picked successively. It is now the time for seated merchants to receive goods. However, due to the difficulty of adjusting silver funds this year, most are afraid to fully develop. Even if they do not reduce the scope, they will not be able to expand. Therefore, the amount of foreign currency purchased from the silver and money industry this time is far less than in previous years. It was heard yesterday that several tea firms commissioned mountain merchants to purchase more than 200,000, and they were all bank notes from Zhongjiao and Lianghang, while spot foreign currency was only 10,000 to 20,000. The departure date is generally set for today and tomorrow, and all mountains in Anhui and Zhejiang must go. According to people in the industry, the sales channels for foreign tea firms this year are expected to be several times better than in previous years. If so, the receipt of goods may gradually increase, it is said.</p>

<p>The trading volume for the whole day was more than 6.9 million. Yesterday, the futures market conditions of various government bonds in this port were generally good. The sales and purchases continued to be active. The opening volume for the previous market was 3.7 million, and the afternoon also had approximately 3.2 million yuan. Internal tariffs were still the most active in the market,</p>
<p>accounting for approximately 2.8 million yuan. Rehabilitation also had more than 1.2 million yuan. Continued Debt had approximately 900,000 yuan. Reorganization had 700,000 yuan. Total Six was calculated as</p>
<p>455,000 yuan. The others remained clear. Continued Two Five was only 320,000. Finance was approximately 200,000. Layoffs opened at 105,000 yuan. 1996 and 1997 each had only 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The spot trading volume was a total of 50,000,</p>
<p>of which Reorganization was more than 33,000 yuan, Finance was 8,000 yuan, and Rehabilitation was 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The tax on tariffs and layoffs each amounted to several thousand yuan. As for the changes in the prices of each bond, layoffs had an unweakened rising momentum due to the excess of demand over supply in the market. Compared with the previous day, the futures rose again by 1.2 yuan. Reorganization and Tariff spot goods were also needed in the market and still accounted for an advantage. The price also continued to rise significantly. However, the trends of other bonds have turned peaceful. Except for Total Six, which rose approximately 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day, most others only</p>
<p>fluctuated by several cents.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Prices Turned Good in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, with a firmer trend. Overseas cotton yarn was stable.</p>
<p>A certain manufacturer searched for a large amount of near-month futures. On the one hand, they transported the yarn in the yarn warehouse to other ports and there was also manufacturer assistance. Therefore, the buyers' courage was particularly strong, and the market situation was tightened by them. It was difficult to fall for a while, but the short attitude was still firm. However, scattered retail investors saw that the situation was not good and were all showing panic. Those who bought to cover were not weak. Fortunately, spot sales were not very smooth, and the rising wind was relatively gentle. The future of the yarn market is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>People's Standard fell and then rose again. The opening of the People's Standard morning market was due to the manufacturer's purchase, and people's hearts were quite strong, recently rising by 35 qian. However, there was no movement for the far months, and the second and third rounds suddenly fell. Each month fell by 2, 8, and 9 qian. In the afternoon, people's hearts suddenly tightened, and the buying interest in the market was quite strong. There was also a rumor of labor unrest, so the market situation became firmer, and each month rose by 7, 8, 9 qian to 1 tael. The total trading volume for the whole day was 21,150 bales. The closing price of People's Standard is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>The cotton market was slightly soft. Overseas cotton markets saw mixed gains and losses, leading to a dull mood. However, the actions of Japanese merchants were quite strange, recently importing and exporting far, so the cotton market situation was more complicated than the yarn market. The source from various routes was relatively scarce, and the Han group tightened and did not let go.</p>
<p>However, some bulls closed positions and softened, it is said.</p>
<p>Han Standard fell by 2.5 qian. The opening of the Han Standard at the exchange,</p>
<p>was tired due to more profit-taking. Each month fell by 1 qian to 2.5 qian. The market atmosphere was still soft in the afternoon. The far months rose by 0.05. The total trading volume for the whole day was 22,500 dan. The closing price of Han Standard is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>The conditions in the US and UK cotton markets varied. Yesterday, US cotton initially weakened due to the lack of major purchases and profit-taking by bulls. Later, it strengthened due to the filling of some short positions. The near-term fell by 7 to 8 points, the far-term rose by 4 to 5 points, and the spot fell by 5 points. UK cotton futures rose and fell by 1 point, and spot fell by 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot remained unchanged, and the Indian cotton market was firm and stable.

<p>Grain and Rice Market Sales Were Sluggish and Continued to Be Weak</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, a few boats from the Inner Route arrived at the port. Sales on this street were extremely sluggish. Northern japonica high-quality goods were stable, and secondary japonica goods from Zhongguan were weak, approaching the corners. The real reason was that buying interest was quiet, and customers were few. Furthermore, continuous cloudy and rainy weather made people's hearts very bad. Thin rice was also stable and soft. The market top opened at 19 yuan.</p>
<p>The guest sales of Sheep Indica were active again, and the Du guest indica was also quite popular. Helplessly, the bottom goods were dry and thin, and the source was also scarce. Transactions did not expand, and buyers saw the goods wither and were unwilling to release offers. The situation was very stable. Changeable negative yuan due to rain influence, sales were flat, and the price lacked fluctuations.</p>
<p>Hunan: The river arrived successively, and sales were very sluggish. Changshu Jijing continued to see downstream. However, special top rice still opened at around 19.5 yuan. The sales of Su Tong Baijing were particularly sluggish, and the price continued to decrease. Southern thin rice and early rice of Feilaifeng and other grades all showed signs of weakness, moving away from the corners. All grades had very little intention to enter, and cargo customers sold due to long-term shelf, so the market was the weakest. Sales of Sheep Du tip saw even, and goods were also rare. However, foreign rice was frequently tight.</p>
<p>This indica followed with excellence. Bai Yuan alcohol appetite slightly improved, and the selection was extremely strict. The market was still mediocre.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Foreign Rice Spot Prices Fell, Futures Rose <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Spot prices fell by one-half corner...futures rose by five-six cents</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market conditions, because of large quantities arriving, but the appetite of local customers did not increase, so the market price saw a sharp drop of 10.5 to 10 cents. However, the futures of big and small twists had consultants from inland and Zhejiang gangs, and instead saw an increase of five-six cents. The route for spot rice was still customers from Zhejiang, Jiangbei, inland, and this street. An estimated 4,000 packages of small twists were opened, priced at 14.67 yuan to 14.55 yuan.</p>
<p>1,000 packages of large twists were priced at 14.3 yuan, 500 packages of No. 1 Saigon were</p>
<p>priced at 15.47 yuan, 300 packages of Calletti brown rice were priced at 14.4 yuan, and the road goods had only a thousand or so packages. A total of 2,800 tons of futures were opened, and small twists accounted for more than half, mostly reclaimed goods, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the morning opening, was generally stable in all months. This month, with actual sales not moving, opened at 2.56 yuan. Far-term months were also similar to the previous day. Until the afternoon opening, the hearts of near-term and far-term traders were firm and expensive again, due to the changing weather, alternating rain and hail. The spring maturity was slightly affected, and the Schadenfreude inland bulls</p>
<p>could not help but stir. Looking at the current flour buyers, the Wuxi gang was the most active. Examining their observation, the ratio with rice prices was not exceeded. So before the rice prices stabilize, the mentality of this year's new flour market</p>
<p>inland help must always be tightly adjusted. Half of the afternoon's rise was due to weather conditions, and half was due to the continuous actions of the inlanders. As a result, this month was 0.05 better than the previous day, May was 0.01 better, June was 0.075 better, July was 0.01 better, and August was 0.075 better, and September was 0.05 better, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, continued to trend upward in each month. In the near term, due to the continuous rise in spot wheat, hearts were tight. In the far term, due to heavy rain and storms, purchases by inland gangs became greedier. The intention of some Xibang was that although June was new wheat, there were few products. Therefore, if a large number was purchased, the seller in the future would likely have great difficulty delivering. This medium was an act of manipulation and speculation, and must be noted later. As a result, the current month twist was 0.01 better than the previous day, June and July each rose by 0.03,</p>
<p>August rose by 0.01, and September was slightly lower by 0.01 in the morning, and not opened in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The spot wheat market conditions, local and Wuxi manufacturers continued to act, causing the high-priced goods to be called up by another 0.04-0.05. This accumulating scramble continues. It is not</p>
<p>known what the intentions of the factories are. The opening for Qingjiangpu wheat was 5.222 yuan, Yaowan wheat was 5.222 yuan, Suzhou wheat was 5.222 yuan, Jiangxi wheat was 5.05 yuan, and Mingguang wheat was 5.16 yuan.</p>
<p>A total of 5,000 packages were opened, and Fuxin, Fufeng, and Wuxi Jiufeng handled them, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Soybean Market Outlook Was Firm <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The recent yellow soybean market conditions have been quite firm, and the Dalian telegram also confirmed that the market was good. In this port, sales are still dominated by oil factories and carriage shops. Inland gangs found it difficult to transport and still hold back, but the market atmosphere was extremely beautiful. Lian Yuan spot prices had already reached 4.45 yuan and between 4.48 and 4.49 yuan. The standard near-term was still 4.45 yuan, but the far-term returned slightly by 0.01. The buying interest of various gangs was still not bad. However, due to the slight softness of the telegrams, the market for soybean cakes was flat and tired. However, the current cake and soybean markets are not easy to loosen.</p>
<p>Hardware, French-Western Nails Handled by Hankou 2,000 Barrels</p>
<p>The recent transactions in French-Western nails have become active again. Such groups as the Yangtze River Road inland rivers, Tianjin, and Fujian all have negotiations, and yesterday the Hankou gang handled as many as 2,000 barrels, the price of which was 6.5 yuan per barrel. The retail market conditions</p>
<p>were still about 6.7 to 6.8 yuan. However, after the market goods were handled by various groups, they became increasingly weak, and people's hearts were trending towards consolidation. It is feared that prices may rise again in the future. In addition, the business of small nails has recently seen good results, with fewer arrivals and thinner inventories. The market atmosphere is stable, and the sales market is firm.</p>
<p>For example, 0.3-inch was priced at 10.05 yuan per barrel, 0.4-inch was priced at 9.75 yuan, 0.5-inch was priced at 10 yuan, and 0.6-inch was priced at 8.5 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>Silk Tea: Factory-Selected Products to the US Are Increasingly Smooth</p>
<p>Lately, the transport of Chinese silk to the United States has become increasingly smooth. In the most recent two weeks, there have been two to three thousand packages transported to the US territory. Therefore, the US houses in Shanghai port have increased their purchasing power for spot factory-selected products. Unfortunately, the manufacturers do not have enough goods in hand, and prices are increasingly trending upward. Yesterday, Qianli, Lanlebi, and others took in another 130 packages of medium and high-quality Shanghai white factory-selected products, and Mitsui took in 30 packages of gray products. Prices all rose by 5 yuan, it is said.</p>

<p>The spring tea from Qimen and Fu has recently seen its tea buds sprout as the weather warms. Harvesting can begin as early as after the Qingming Festival. Tea firms in various villages and towns are preparing to open their processing sites. Those purchasing and transporting tea to Jingdezhen and Tunxi are constantly on the road. The silver dollars stored in Tunxi and Jingdezhen banks have been nearly exhausted due to purchasing by these firms, leading to a rise in the exchange rate in Tunxi to 1,373 yuan per 1,000 taels, and in Jingdezhen, from 1,390 yuan to 1,378 yuan. Fortunately, the number of tea firms has sharply decreased this year, so less silver is needed for tea purchases, and the initial payments should be sufficient. Several firms in the Fudi area suffered significant losses last year.</p>
<p>Tea warehouses are tightening lending, and most have not yet opened, it is said.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: Market Trend Softens</p>
<p>Due to sluggish actual sales recently, the piece goods market shows signs of softening.</p>
<p>Yesterday's heavy rain further dampened trading. Customer groups</p>
<p>had no wholesale orders to replenish, and the street was also nearly deserted. Eastern goods, such as fine broadcloth, have fallen by 0.25%, Lake Pavilion bald blue-gray is priced at 3.75%, assorted colors at 2.325%, Baizitu assorted colors at 2.3%, Zhigong satin by the first group is priced at 2.5%, Sanmatou at 2.475%, six-pound Guo Ju red label at 3.85 taels, four-pound at 3.15 taels, Zhigong serge Moganshan at 2.625%, Shuangtonglu at 2.325%, a slight decrease of 0.25% to 0.5% compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Printed calico is scarce in the market, and shops on this street still have strong demand. Over thirty pieces were sold yesterday, Meilanfang small floral print for 1.95%, Qingguan clock pattern for 1.9%, and printed linen for around 2.1%.</p>
<p>Western goods are also quieter than before, but there have been inquiries about glass yarn. Lower quality goods are selling for 2.5%, while upper-quality goods are at 4.25%. Over twenty pieces of seven-thread raw silk were continuously sold on this street. Locksley &amp;amp; Co.'s abundant bald white silk was uniformly priced at 5.15 taels, and assorted colors at 5.25 taels, it is said.</p>
<p>Coal: Heavy Rain Makes Coal Market Quiet: Yesterday afternoon, a heavy downpour hit this port, significantly reducing the number of people in the market. Consequently, coal transactions were unusually slow. Total sales of all types of smokeless and white coals amounted to only over 200 tons. Market prices have fallen by one or two copper coins, it is said.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: 2,200 bales of cotton yarn and piece goods will be shipped to Xun today.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Melancholy Female Poet: Baihe <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Yu Yan's "Lake Wind"</p>
<p>One evening, at a coffee shop in Ximen, I saw a "Creative Monthly Review" in a magazine. The last paragraph was a critique of Ms. Yu Yan's collection of poems, "Lake Wind."</p>
<p>What kind of message does the female poet Yu Yan, who is making her debut on the literary scene, bring us in her collection "Lake Wind"? It's a melancholic lake wind, a sorrowful sentiment. Her emotions are not commensurate with her age; a pessimistic and world-weary tone has grown in her young heart. Objectively speaking, her profound melancholy is not entirely due to the stimulation of actual life, but is also somewhat influenced by pessimistic philosophy.</p>
<p>Before reading "Lake Wind," I already had the impression of "a melancholy female poet" in my mind.</p>
<p>Opening the collection, I saw in the preface evaluative words such as "Yan's poems are indeed too bleak," which immediately reminded me of the lines in Li Daoqing's "Qingyu Case Ci":</p>
<p>Now I understand, spring sorrow and hatred, are always the poet's lot.</p>
<p>I remember someone saying that women are creatures rich in emotion, and poets are also rich in emotion, so it can be said that they are "women among men" (see Kitamura Tokoku's "World-Weary Poets and Women"). Considering the meaning of these words,</p>
<p>then it can be concluded that women have a special talent for writing poetry, which may not be without reason. However, opponents argue that poetry is a symbol of human suffering. Chinese women have traditionally lived in a dependent position due to social structures. Unless they are abandoned or widowed, they will not have much suffering. Moreover, they do not come into contact with human life.</p>
<p>What they know is nothing more than needlework and cosmetics; what they feel is nothing more than spring flowers, autumn moons, and the bedchamber. Their poverty is sometimes physical hardship, but there is no spiritual pain. Or sometimes there are a few with clear minds, but they are bound by the ethics of the family, and they disappear in a moment. Therefore, it is rare to have remarkable literary creations.</p>
<p>Regardless of the literary value of Yu Yan's "Lake Wind," I will now just write a few personal thoughts after reading it.</p>
<p>"Lake Wind" contains a total of thirty-eight poems, twenty-two of which describe scenery, fourteen express emotions, and two are miscellaneous small poems. Among the landscape poems, "A Broken Boat" best fits the form of a pure narrative poem, while "Nameless Flower" is the most brilliant. Among the lyric poems, although many use objects to convey emotions, we can also glimpse a bit of the author's thoughts.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the lines in "Lake Wind" are negative in meaning. In almost every poem, one can read phrases related to a state of melancholy, such as "loneliness of life," "sorrowful sentiment," "heart after being wounded,"</p>
<p>"night cry of the cuckoo," "infinite sorrow," "skeleton in the grave," "withered yellow leaves," "sad new moon," "final annihilation," and so on. According to the research of abnormal psychologists, the number of Chinese women who are physically weak and mentally depressed is quite large, especially among women in the intellectual class. Because of their weak constitution and mental depression, they usually feel listless and tired.</p>
<p>When they encounter relatively strong stimuli, they feel overwhelmed, unbearable, helpless, and without a plan, and even become "languid" or "sick," and "thinner than a yellow flower." Therefore, their expressions of emotion are mostly depressed.</p>
<p>Words such as worry, sorrow, and weeping, hidden behind closed doors, have become meaningful activities in the daily life of poets (see Pan Guangdan's "Analysis of Xiaoqing"). The above discussion is just a conclusion drawn after a general observation of female poets in the old Chinese era, and can also be regarded as a diagnosis for "sentimental and sickly" female poets.</p>
<p>Whether the author of "Lake Wind" has the mental depression mentioned above, we dare not make any conjectures because we do not know "Yan's experiences" and "the marks on her heart." But in her few lyric poems, if those lines are all the author's confessions and expressions, we can cite the following lines confessed by Ms. Yu:</p>
<p>In "I Wish to Transform into Green Smoke," she tells us her ideals and aspirations. She wants to break away from the human world, which has a "land of aging" and "pain and worry," and transform into green smoke.</p>
<p>Resting in the mountains,</p>
<p>Becoming a confidante of the clouds.</p>
<p>To express her interest, the author also titled herself "Xiuyun" (Cloud Sleeve). Whether this interest is inspired by the author's love of nature or influenced by others' pessimistic philosophies, we do not need to study it. But we can say that the author's view of life is world-weary. Let us try to read her following lines:</p>
<p>Ah, the beautiful dewdrops on the lotus petals,</p>
<p>Life is as empty as you are.</p>
<p>Although people will sometimes praise you,</p>
<p>Do not be greedy for that fleeting vanity.</p>
<p>When the sunlight shines brightly on the earth,</p>
<p>You will be greatly shamed and ridiculed.</p>
<p>/ Summer Night</p>
<p>Let us drink a glass of sweet red wine,</p>
<p>Do not seek people's pity,</p>
<p>People's pity,</p>
<p>Is more shameful than sneers.</p>
<p>/ To Ms. SS</p>
<p>A heart that is bright red and passionate,</p>
<p>Is deeply trapped in this empty life.</p>
<p>It's all over,</p>
<p>What is success and hope,</p>
<p>What is true affection and sincere love,</p>
<p>Are all buried in the desolate valley,</p>
<p>Submerged in the Dead Sea.</p>
<p>/ A Dirge of Life</p>
<p>Reading these lines, I thought of Mr. Qian Xingcun's saying that "a pessimistic and world-weary tone has grown in her young heart," which seems very reasonable. Disgust for the world is originally a common trait among young people, especially among poets. Originally, in the career of mankind,</p>
<p>since the germination of thought, everyone hopes for truth, beauty, and goodness, and dislikes ugliness. This is a natural principle. But for people who are not familiar with the world and cannot penetrate the depths of the world, when they first encounter all the disturbances and disharmony of the real world, they feel that everything is at odds with their ideals. In the youth age when knowledge and experience are in opposition, and ideals and reality are at war, it is natural to have strange and world-weary views of life. Because of her young age and the fact that she has not lost the pure thoughts of her girlhood, the author of "Lake Wind" is completely isolated from the real social life, and it is inevitable that she will have a world-weary view of life.</p>
<p>Since a poet has developed a disgust for actual life, he dares not expect too much hope for the future. Therefore, he has to think back to the illusions of the past and savor the taste of olives in remembrance. Therefore, the author of "Lake Wind" often sings about her childhood.</p>
<p>Where is the perfect dreamland?</p>
<p>In this past childhood.</p>
<p>/ A Dirge of Life</p>
<p>And afraid to see</p>
<p>The neighbors laughing at me</p>
<p>Leaning on the chests of those old people</p>
<p>I am not |</p>
<p>I am not tired of that pure sound</p>
<p>Jealous of the innocence of the children |</p>
<p>Because my childhood is hard to come back</p>
<p>/ Me in May</p>
<p>But these are not the author's true distresses,</p>
<p>Nor are they her true sorrows. What exactly is the melancholy and distress of Ms. Yu Yan? We can find the root cause in these lines:</p>
<p>Sickness,</p>
<p>Depression,</p>
<p>Let the window,</p>
<p>Be battered by wind and rain,</p>
<p>Who will comfort me?</p>
<p>/ Sick</p>
<p>Ask,</p>
<p>The vast sky,</p>
<p>This defect in the heart,</p>
<p>What</p>
<p>/ Night's Groan</p>
<p>The singing of the neighboring girl is faint</p>
<p>I'm afraid she's looking for a confidante</p>
<p>Otherwise, why so melancholy</p>
<p>But me,</p>
<p>I still have to envy you,</p>
<p>You have the courage to look for it,</p>
<p>/ Envy</p>
<p>In the overlapping heads,</p>
<p>She opened her eyes and looked around,</p>
<p>Only feels a vast blackness before her eyes,</p>
<p>Unable to find a confidante</p>
<p>Even more unable to see a companion,</p>
<p>/ A Singer in the City</p>
<p>Ah, wise and intelligent readers, do you all know now the source of our female poet's melancholy? This source of illness is also commonly infected by general poets. All the songs of all young poets have this kind of melancholy lurking. Try to look at Goethe's most famous lines:</p>
<p>Who has never eaten bread in sorrow,</p>
<p>Who has never wept in the night,</p>
<p>Sitting alone waiting for the morning,</p>
<p>He does not know you, ah, you great power.</p>
<p>What exactly is this great power?</p>
<p>To say it is love. A man in his prime, whose physiology</p>
<p>has matured, who is not hungry and thirsty for women? Because of longing for the beauty of one side of the sky, he tosses and turns and cannot sleep, expressing his worries in poetry, and it is naturally easy to win the tears of sympathy from many readers. Similarly, women must also long for men. So-called spring heart flaring and love born, love unsuccessful and poetry made, that is a natural principle.</p>
<p>Human suffering and melancholy, especially the depressed souls of poets, if they hold deep-rooted world-weary concepts, there is no medicine to cure them. Religious beliefs cannot overcome their world-weariness, and worldly pleasures cannot break their negativity. There is only one treasure that can be used as a symptomatic remedy for those purely ideal young poets, and that is love.</p>
<p>Kitamura Tokoku in "World-Weary Poets and Women"</p>
<p>has a very insightful discussion in one section:</p>
<p>World-weary people have no other hope for the present world. Money and profit are certainly not what they hope for. Even the crown of the Son of Heaven and the wealth and glory of the King of the Road are never hoped for. Therefore, the world-weary are incompatible with the hopes of the present world. However, only love has a secret recipe that can penetrate into the groaning chest of world-weary people. The strangest thing is that they place many hopes in love. The thing called "affection" will not let you be quiet for a moment. As soon as you step in, your heart is always disturbed. Moreover, the world-weary who are most prone to agitation in their lives have suffered setbacks in the realization of society, and are instead conquered by the strange magic of love. At this time, he stands up with his whole body and soul and becomes a slave to love. Isn't that a very obvious reason?</p>
<p>Only after men and women love each other can they begin to understand the truth of society. At that time, even a tiny insect is not isolated, nor can it leave us and act automatically. In the society where human beings gather together, we must rely on each other and embrace each other before we can maintain or build society. We cannot understand this principle unless we climb the first level of "loving each other". When a person lives alone, he does not have the elements of a complete member of society. Only after two people come together are they counted as a member of society.</p>
<p>After men and women are united, the floating clouds moving in the sky at dawn also seem to have faces, and the calls of old birds in the forest also seem to have tones. Yesterday's past seems like decades ago, and today's present seems like an existence that can extend for generations.</p>
<p>Since people have gained this proper position, they can understand the obligations to God, the obligations to mankind, and the morality of what they previously thought was a brilliant flower, reducing his delusions and increasing his reality, in order to lay the foundation for him to enter the "noon" of life.</p>
<p>The above discussion can prove that poets in general who have a world-weary view of life are more eager to pursue and be hungry for love than ordinary young men and women. This is something that can often be discovered and confirmed in their literary creations.</p>
<p>Because reading "Lake Wind" gave rise to some thoughts,</p>
<p>I have slipped into saying many irrelevant things. I feel deeply sorry for the author of "Lake Wind" and the readers. Now I should end my words.</p>
<p>Finally, I offer my sincerity, hoping that Ms. Yu Yan will no longer sing such "wandering songs".</p>
<p>That early and late blazing sun,</p>
<p>Also did not warm my heart,</p>
<p>Sorrow and worry,</p>
<p>Often hover in my heart.</p>
<p>Ah, young female poet, turn your strings and change your voice, sing a joyful tune.</p>
<p>Let me wash away the worries of writing,</p>
<p>Let me enjoy your holy light for a long time.</p>
<p>/ Great and Kind Moon: I bless you, melancholy female poet.</p>
<p>New Discoveries on Vitamins by Female Chemists</p>
<p>Recently, two female chemists have made very important discoveries about vitamins. One is Ms. Katherine Hoboe Coward, who is a member of the London Medical Association, and the other is Ms. Vera Rer, a very intelligent scholar in the Department of Biochemistry at Oxford University. The vitamin discovered by Ms. Coward has not yet been named. This vitamin is most abundant in fresh milk, beef, beef liver, and wheat germ, and is an essential nutrient for lambs and mice. But it is not yet known whether it is an essential nutrient for us. Ms. Ritter's contribution to us is vitamin B3. Originally, there was only one type of vitamin B, which was later divided into vitamin B1 and vitamin B2. But now Ms. Ritter has discovered a third type, which is truly good news for researchers in biochemistry. According to Ms. Ritter's experiments, the similarity between vitamin B2 and vitamin B3 is that both are easily destroyed by heat. (Xiong Wan)</p>
