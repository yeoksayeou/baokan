<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本回訓發出後</h3>
<p>關於海會命運前途與日本立國根本大計之回訓案。費多數時日之考量商榷。而始决定發出。其爲特别鄭重。已可槪見。夫可槪見。夫日本當局所以遲遲决定此種半讓步之回訓案。一方面固以遷就美國妥恊意旨。藉减海會决裂之危機。一方面以保留在型巡艦對美七成之要求。緩和海軍派反對之氣勢。不可謂非日本當局之苦心孤詣。惟此回訓發出以後。英美方面對此保留。果能完全贊同而一無問題乎。海軍派方面對此回訓。果能完全諒解而不生反響乎。則尙未可知也。據今日日本電訊。雖有三國主力艦恊定成立之說。然英美代表。對此回訓内容。尙未有何表示。且其他未决問題尙多。未能遽認爲圓满解决也。至海軍派之態度。依然强硬反對。雖經濱口首相召集海軍次官等要求諒解。財部全權召集海軍委員。極力撫慰然尙多表示不满。且反對者不。僅軍界貴族院對政府輭化。亦表示憤懑。今日東京之國民會議。亦認回訓爲陷國防於。危殆。一致表示反對觀此情勢。則正予反對黨以彈劾政府之機會。故因此案而引起日政局之糾紛。亦未始不可能之事。即使此案幸不牽動政局。然實行軍缩後所减省之費。如何使用。亦爲將來紛爭之一問題。此後果能盡移此費以用之於敎育或補充减稅藉輕人民負擔。始於國家有實益。若如軍界方面意。爲欲挽救軍縮之故。努力於塡補國防計劃之缺陷。移此費以充實海軍内容。則與不軍縮無異。人民又何利乎軍縮。故預料軍民兩方對此問題。尙不免於爭執也。</p>

<p>敎所述各節、渠不能一一承認、俄境各事之眞確與否、不在任何政府調查範圍之内、渠知去年曾有若干仇敎慘事、但垷已</p>
<p>改善、英政府願用其所有勢力以扶助信敎自由、但俄國若不破壞英國承認蘇俄之條件、則英政府不欲斷絕外交關係也、今日事態已不若過去十年中任何時代之可怖、至於敎育一層、純爲内政外人政府</p>
<p>欲干涉之必有下述兩種條件而後可、即（一）確實證明其所措施之不當、極爲嚴重、而成文明世界全體之患、（二）確知干涉結果不致使其害變本加厲、否則不宜出此、</p>
<p>如維持反交日後或有疏通俄政府之機會、外部對於大主敎、所提數點、當愼重考慮之云、</p>

<p>待新聞記者、到二十餘人、劉蘆隱主席、報告略謂本週北方現狀、較上週情形尤爲險惡、茲將連日所是之北方社會經濟軍事政治各種狀况、約</p>
<p>略報告如下、（一）社會方面、自閻用武力强佔北平機關後、最近更用專制獨裁方法、監視各種言論機關、實行檢查郵電、斷絕北平、山西與各地交</p>
<p>通、在北平報紙、除閻機關報爲閻宣傳外、餘均被封閉、即外人所辦報紙、亦均如此、閻同時並派遣密探、满佈平津一帶、旅行平津人民多數皆被暗中監視、對外人尤爲注意、以現狀而言、當地人民直無言論及居住　自由之權、（二）經濟方面、最近閻多方吸收現金、推行紙弊、强迫人民使用、一方並用搜刮政策、在平綏漢兩路竭力搜刮、據最近所得報告、平漢路每年可收入三千多萬、自被閻搜刮後、每年收入最多不過一千萬、平綏方面、每年可收九百萬至一千萬、現在收入已不足三百萬、閻並預徵錢糧、現已徵至民國二</p>
<p>十二年、此種作繭自縛政策、預料不到二三月後即有最大危險、（三）軍事方面、閻宣傳韓復榘全部離開河南、乃山西軍事上勝利、並要挾馮玉祥出兵、現馮尙在觀望、同時馮軍已由鄭開到洛陽馮觀望原因、即係因閻欲得河南地艦、並將以萬選才爲安徽主席、石友三爲山東主席、因此馮對出兵問題與閻互相推諉、據現在情形以觀、馮閻不但不能合作、且將因爭奪河南地盤而至火併、至於其他方面軍事、現在均甚安靜、（四）政治方面、</p>
<p>閻本欲借一二三屆執委爲號召、並非眞正要黨、而改組派西山派等竟不識時務、麕集北平、現閻對西山改組兩派已漸覺討厭、對陳公博等已不見面、分裂之象、已暴露無遺、同時馮對僞副司令職亦遲遲不就、致北平僞政府亦不能實現、此種同床各夢之局面、實不能以持久、此外據東北報告、東北絕對服從中央、始終不渝、張長官對中央命令、完全服從、故東北方面毫無問題云云、報告畢即散會、</p>

<p>昨早（三十一日）省府舉行總理紀念週　、</p>
<p>陳對時局近况、曾有詳細報告、略謂最近一週間時局變化極大、中央因力維和平、故令韓復榘部退駐魯西、并發表韓爲冀魯豫剿匪總指揮、萬選才東侵、已被韓軍擊潰、萬部退密縣、損失極大、孫殿英經中央軍與韓復榘部夾擊、大部被繳械、餘部潰退四散、韓復榘奉到中央命令後、今日可以抵濟寗、東昌以南、均歸韓部担任防務、魯省防務、益臻鞏固、此次韓以萬選才東侵、深爲憤慨、原擬西進追擊、以奉中央命令變更戰略、只得遵令撤退、魯北方面、現傅作義一部已佔德州、修理黃河崖鐡橋、津浦綫晋軍、現有兩師一旅、近在蘆台塘沽馬廠滄州等處、積極建築防禦工事、聞平津各機關較好器具、已</p>
<p>被晋軍搬運一空、足證閻對戰事毫無把握、且無前進準備、故余敢保證、魯省决無危險云云、（四月一日）</p>

<p>一日）上午十時、邀同何總指揮、假靑年會招待新聞界、說明時局情形、到三十餘人、首由宣傳部長譚常愷報告招待意</p>
<p>義、略謂今天諸君冒雨出席、非常欣慰、現有幾件要事、特向各位報告、最近汪蔣合作之聲浪、喧閙一時、須知蔣總司令行動、是站在黨的立塲、受黨的命令指揮、汪精衛旣經開除黨籍、當無叙用餘地、汪蔣合作、實不可能、又馮閻爲背叛黨國之罪魁、以事實證之、馮閻之勾結、萬不能持久、其利益之衝突、最要者爲海口問題、無論誰得海口、即可制對方之死命、馮意在取得天津、而閻竭力制止、馮閻地域之分配、原定馮出師平漢路及襄陽、而最近閻驟改變方針、平漢路歸晋軍作戰、馮亦不出襄陽、而橫師隴海、故向山東方面、進展、是其全作、已將根本破裂、又挑撥造謠、爲政客及失意軍人慣技、亦爲反革命向本黨攻擊之利器、望新聞界同志努力糾正云云、次何鍵報告云、史弟久想與各位接談、今日趁此機會、將湖南情形說說、湖南始終是中央的湖南、無論如何、</p>
<p>湖南以國民革命爲立塲、故省府設施、均以國民革命爲主旨、又湖南亦爲國民黨治下之湖南、故全湖南之軍隊、以擁護中央爲主旨、維持治安爲職責、目前時局發生變化、湖南軍隊除大部份奉命開到廣西、各報已有詳細記載外、茲有重要關鍵一點、應向各位報告、蔣總司令命令第四路軍於上月九號集中桂林、在上月七號湖南軍隊已到達大溶江、去桂林僅一日又半路程、其所以未進駐桂林者、蓋作戰爲恊同工作、四路軍之左第六路軍、再左第八路軍、當四路軍進展時、第六路軍因受民團牽掣而移開、以致左翼空虚、而呈孤軍突進狀態、此不僅於軍事上不能發生效力、且有妨害、故爲愼重計、不得不稍爲停頓、後與第六路車總指揮恊商、將計畫變更、决定六路軍入平樂、四路軍即進桂林、以收恊同工作之效、按後定計劃、今日應已到桂、然所以仍未入駐者因六路軍又别有任務、以致計畫中變、有人</p>
<p>說湖南軍隊不中用、或說湖南軍隊不服從中央命令、實屬不明事實之言、蓋湖南軍欲進駐桂林、馬上即取得、然軍事上不能發生效力、故未實行、再講到本省勦匪情况、鄰省之江西湖北、匪勢浩大、共黨乘廣西多事、長江軍隊無暇兼顧之時、在鄂西通城·及本省南華安一帶、大肆活動、組設蘇維埃政府、幸均先後破獲、擔任南華安共黨工作之首領葉魁、業經捕殺、共黨計畫、已不得逞、江西匪患甚烈、且軍隊不易抽調、幸汽朱路通、由攸趕調部隊進駐萍鄉、平瀏可告無事、現在人民</p>
<p>談匪色變、懼怕非常、本無足怪、惟兄弟對湖南全省治安、可負完全責任、然欲求根本肅淸、則非與江西魯主席湖北何主　席會勦不爲功、又湖南因環境困難、談不到十分完好、不過極力向好的方面進行、只要治安能維持下去、年歲豐收、財力充裕、即有辦法、現在長常各汽車路、於最近均將通車、將來公路局收入充裕、經費有着、省府四十萬津貼、可移作别項急務之用、建設前途、可抱樂觀云云、至十二時茶點而散、（一日）</p>

<h3>女子籃球</h3>

<p>四十二比十</p>
<p>昨日下午三時遼閩戰後、粵鄂姊妹相繼登塲、粵矯健活潑、湖北莊重老練、雙方擇定地盤、開始攻擊、湖北先得二分、廣東不敢輕視、速起追随、前鋒傳遞迅速、頗有進展、上半時粵以十五對八勝、下半時粵盧慧孄李　明身段靈活、遠擲近投、百發百中、盧獨得十九分、李得十四分、湖北胡文寬擲籃亦好、但無人輔助、不能盡長、結果四十二對十廣東勝、</p>

<p>（二）津勝平乙</p>
<p>十九比十</p>
<p>冒雨舉行</p>
<p>昨晚杭州下雨、竟夜未止、今晨（三日）九時，女子籃球比賽、爲天津對北平乙隊、球塲潮濕，事前曾由僕役先將地板掃去積水、再以毛巾乾拭，但天公故作惡劇、拭後雨點復平、潮濕如前、裁判因限於會章、乃冒雨舉行、</p>
<h3>觀客寥寥</h3>
<p>看檯四面皆空、看客寥寥無幾、一因天雨、一因爲時尙早、塲中除選手百餘外、幾無外來觀客、</p>
<p>天津選手組織啦啦隊、爲其姊妹助威、聲勢浩大、引起興奮不少、</p>
<h3>劇戰情形</h3>
<p>雙方擇定陣地，裁判員即宣佈開始爭鬥，天津中鋒拍球、左鋒穆祥淑接得傳右、孫家瑩搶上接</p>
<p>住、玉手高舉、球已入籃，中鋒劉俊元又罰得一分、北平受此挫年，亟起反攻、吳瑞秀亦擲入一</p>
<p>分、天津前鋒緊迫敵營，孫家瑩投籃尤佳、乃以十對一終第一節、第二節中雙方競爭尤烈，奈以塲地濘滑、前仰後仆、不能盡展所長、上半時終了、天津以十六對三獲勝、檸檬時間後、再戰聲起、天津多調預備員遞補、實力稍衰、北平趁此機會、猛攻甚烈、以圖背城一戰、第三點比數爲三對三、第四節始、北平吳瑞秀連中的、風勢大轉、奈天津防禦森嚴，不能盡所欲爲、胡茄一</p>
<p>聲、時間終了、天津乃以十九對十獲得勝利、各節比數爲十丨丨一、六丨丨二、三丨丨三、○丨*</p>
<p>丨四、裁判員宋君復張匯蘭、</p>
<h3>天津技佳</h3>
<p>是役也、雙方均以天雨、未能盡顯眞實本領、然</p>
<p>天津之傳遞、並不以地滑而減色、後衛尤稱穩健、北平前鋒聯絡尙佳、惟投籃用力太重、每不能中的了耳、</p>

<h3>初賽上海大勝湖南</h3>
<p>二與另之比</p>
<p>滬表演甚佳</p>
<p>上海隊人才濟濟、實力充足、各隊員多係久經戰陣之士、技能純熟、經騐豐富、在此次大會中、亦具有奪標之資格、湘隊素以勇敢耐戰名、然技能經騐、相差甚多、且聯絡方面、更欠嚴密、初次之陣、即遇此强敵、無怪其處處受迫、毫無進展之餘地、其能不吃鴨蛋、亦云幸矣開賽以後、滬隊一路順風、所向披靡、第一局以二十一比一獲勝、第二局再戰、湘隊士氣沉銷、軍無鬭志、滬隊則毫不費力、又以二十一比三勝之、結果二比</p>

<p>浙江勝江西</p>
<p>表演均不佳</p>
<p>浙隊較優良</p>
<p>三日上午九時、浙江與江西之女排球初賽、二隊</p>
<p>實力、不相伯仲、因天雨地濕、雙方表演、均無甚精彩可言、惟浙隊之斯雅珊、擊球還球尙覺得力</p>
<p>、堪稱爲個中翹楚、第一局中、浙江極佔勝勢、分</p>
<p>數激增、張興孝·沈婉貞·相繼得七分、贛隊祗有一分、旋浙隊先以十一比一摸方、以後贛隊攻勢、漸見起色、分數亦遞增至十一、然浙江同時亦有猛速之進展、在十三比十之際、輪及戴浦發球、接連勝得七球、而以二十比十佔先、以後各得一分、浙遂以二十一比十一勝第一局、</p>
<p>二局開始、浙江乘勝進攻、曾得有八對一之勝勢、江西亦不甘落後、急起直追、張耀德發球較佳、</p>
<p>連獲六分、漸與浙隊相近、以後局勢平平、雙方</p>
<p>各有所得、而贛則漸趨勝勢、卒以二十一比十九勝得第二局、</p>
<p>二隊各勝一局之後、第三局遂爲勝負之關鍵、故競爭形勢、漸形緊張、惟浙隊人才較爲平均、合作工夫亦較優、斯雅珊發球得六分、因之氣勢大振、贛隊陣局散漫、應付每多失着、終以九比二十一敗北、結果二比一、浙勝、裁判員吳邦偉、兩隊陣線如左、</p>

<h3>天津勝湖南</h3>
<p>三日下午一時、天津與湖南女排球隊舉行初賽、津隊隊員體質堅張、英風颯颯、湘隊矯捷活潑、身段玲琍、其饒勇善戰之槪、一望而知、當開始之際、津隊首獲三分、湖南發球、復以六分駕而上之、雙方戰鬭、極形劇烈、而彼此分數、亦始終相近、迨湘以十一對七之比數、易陣再戰、津隊忽猛力進攻、前後三排、聯終呼應、頗爲得手、幸湘隊守禦有方、尤以中排之楊仁最爲出色、其壓球本領、迅速有力、疾如脫免、而救球復從容不</p>
<p>迫、輕重合度、凡所擊之球、從未一遭失敗、且發</p>
<p>球沉猛、往往使對方無法還擊、居中策應、指揮全局、極能稱職、然以聯絡方面、較欠周到、故易</p>
<p>爲對方所乘、津隊卒以二十一比十九勝第一局、觀比數之相近、可以審當時競爭之烈矣、二局續戰、津隊鼓其餘勇、乘勝進攻、初以十一對三佔先、繼成十四對五之比、旋又陸續獲得七分、而以二十一比十獲勝、結果二比○、裁判員譚天沛、兩隊陣綫如左、</p>

<h3>滬乙勝江蘇</h3>
<p>滬乙與江蘇二隊、於下午二時初賽、兩隊人才、不相上下、惟蘇隊經騐較淺、佈陣散漫、恒予對方以進攻之機、此爲失敗之要因、開賽之初、蘇隊曾一度以六四估先、惜以後接球還球、極形慌亂、而滬隊之龐桂英·徐慧英、壓球頗見功夫、發球有力、分數亦繼長遞增、未及多時、即以二十一比十一勝第一局、續戰以後、蘇隊雖振作精神、力圖敗中取勝、亦曾取得十一比九之勝勢、奈滬隊多係久戰之師、見局勢不佳、莫不謹愼從事、鎭靜非常、還球救球、穩當合法、全隊聯絡周到、使對方無函𨻶可乘、以後分數復漸次增加、又以二十一對十七勝第二局、裁判員邱紀祥、</p>

<h3>田徑錦標預測</h3>
<p>遼滬已達肉搏時期</p>
<p>但遼隊似較有希望</p>
<p>女錦標尙在逐鹿中</p>
<p>男子田徑賽、滬遼二隊已達肉搏時期、遼徑賽見長、滬田賽占先、結果、遼已追出滬三分、未决賽者僅二百米·標槍·撑竿跳·萬米·四種、二百米遼劉長春穩得第一、滬鍾連基第二、萬米遼姜雲龍趙德勝、恐非滬陳虚舟所能敵、標槍滬王李淮較有希望、撑竿跳遼孫廣琛必佔位置、預測田</p>
<p>徑錦標、遼希望較滬稍大、倘標槍撑竿跳、滬均獲勝利、或能與遼競爭、</p>
<p>女子田徑、三日止平九分半、第一、粵六分第二、但東特徑賽極佳、跳遼孫桂雲希望頗大、又五十米·百米·粵隊足與特競爭、故女錦標粵與東特得分最多、亞軍則爲平遼所逐鹿、今日戰後、便知分曉、</p>

<h3>昨日田俓賽槪評</h3>
<p>三級跳决賽</p>
<p>廣東司徒光異軍突起、三級跳遠、以一三·三九咪、突破全國紀錄、遼寗蕭鼎華以一三·一○之遠度列第二、成績亦尙可觀矣、蕭鼎華之三級跳本有草上飛之號、成績略遜、蓋方賽高欄畢也、然成績尙可满人意也、司徒光跳時姿勢極佳、第二次跳時、牙齒咬緊、一躍一步一跳、遂造成一三·三九咪之新紀錄、惟與遠東紀錄一五·三五咪之遠度、尙差少許、據司徒君云、此成績尙未爲伊之最佳者、則再加努力、遠東會中惟君是賴矣、王正廷部長之造成全國新紀錄大銀杯一只、猶其餘事也、</p>
<p>張靜江參觀田徑賽　　月溪攝</p>
<h3>擲鐡餅决賽</h3>
<p>擲鐡餅成績三一·八七味殊不能令人满意、昨今二日之擲重成績铅球鐡餅成績均不見大佳、未審何故、最初三次預擲、遼寗張世安於第二次投擲以三零·二八米冠全隊、最後三次、北平趙文藻以三一·八七味躍居第一、名次遂定、</p>
<h3>女子跳高决賽</h3>
<p>女子田徑賽成績前日廣東陳佩桃擲棒球旣以三八·四六咪打破全國紀錄、昨日跳高决賽、湖北馮發蘭女士又以一·一米之成績、打破全國紀錄、起賽計二十餘人、高度跳至一·一三咪時、餘七人、即得分之七位女士、所可貴者、此七女士俱破全國紀錄、（全國紀錄李遂銀一·一零米）再跳馮蕭誠三女士又過一·一九米主主度、最後湖北馮發蘭女士以一·四二二米造成、全國新紀錄、賽畢北平蕭美珍女士珠淚奪框而出、衆急慰之、蓋蕭女士據云、在北平能跳四呎六吋之高、約合一·四零米、今與南京誠恩慈女士合得第二、屈居次席、似有不甘此亦佳話也、</p>
<h3>男百米决賽</h3>
<p>昨日下午一時、男子百米舉行决賽、南北兩傑、一决雌雄、觀象之興奮、亦達於極點、抽定位置後、鍾連基排在外道第二線、劉長春排在第三線、槍聲第一響、除劉外均偷跑一步、第二次亦然、至第三次始正式出發、然劉卒因起跑過慢、落在三四名間、至近八十米時、鍾連基居首位、劉與之相差仍數吋、至達點之一步時、錘仍居首、劉奮力一躍、斜右肩先觸終點白線、逐得第一、</p>
<p>與錘相距不满一吋、亦云險矣、第三四爲上海蔣鵬郝春德奪得、天津周兆元竟列第五名落選、然均與第一之满相距不满一步、幾至不能分别、誠爲大觀、但昨日天雨方霽、跑道鬆濕、無可用勁、致成績大跌、殆非人力所可挽回、本報預測十九得中、可告無罪矣、</p>
<h3>男四百米决賽</h3>
<p>昨日下午四百米决賽、出發時劉長春即居第一、</p>
<p>達三百米時、更爲奮力、距第二名之廣東麥國珍、幾及一丈、成績爲五十二秒五分三、較前兩日均佳、打破全國錄、但較其在遼時所跑成績尙差、但不失爲昨日大會最出色之成績也、</p>
<p>昨日高欄决賽　　林澤民攝</p>
<p>[P千五百米决賽</p>
<p>昨日男子千五百米决賽、遼寗長跑健將姜雲龍趙德新、獲居一二兩席、確有眞實本領、起賽時、江蘇宋澤第一位置、第二爲遼寗趙德新、第三爲北平范寳恩、第四爲遼寗姜雲龍、至第二圈時、遼趙姜追及、佔一二位置、宋退列第三、范第四、至第三圈、一二名未動、范第三、宋第四、最後之半圈時、宋拚命追趕、范又落後、一二仍未動、距終點約有百米時、姜雲龍咬緊牙關、竟將趙德新衝出、套得首席、成績亦佳、然與其在遼所跑之成績、尚差二秒、</p>
<h3>高欄决賽</h3>
<p>昨日高欄决賽之結果、殊出一般人意料之外、遼寗名將蕭鼎華、屈居第三、不幸之至、出發時北平王玉振居首、蕭次之、福建要紹洲第三、在八十米時、林即奮勇衝出、飛躍而過、蕭鼎華似已力乏、無從追趕、卒爲林奪去冠軍、惜哉、遼寗隊</p>
<p>田徑分數、亦因遭一大打擊、</p>
<h3>女子百米複賽</h3>
<p>昨日女百米複賽、東特孫桂雲在第一組中、仍居首席、取决賽之冠軍、易如探囊、今日之决賽、據記者之觀測、孫桂雲第一、廣東黃淑瑋劉有慶爭第二三、第四名或係東特王淵、又昨因天雨後孫孫雲之成績亦大差、今日倘能放晴、或可造成新紀錄也、</p>
<h3>于右任贈總理遺墨</h3>
<p>中央委員于右任先生、昨致全國軍動大會影印總理遺墨五十份、題曰「尙武樓」三字、下有于先生跋曰、尙武樓三字、爲總理所書、贈中華武術會者、總理生平不習書、亦無暇習書、而其渾厚淵穆之氣、自入於古、所請人書俱高也、中華全國運動會開會於杭州、因從吳志靑同志手、索來影印、以贈得勝者、尤願總理之奮鬥精神、普及全國也、十九年黃花岡紀念日于右任敬記、</p>

<p>營口拒装日輪、　在華日本航商、已經秘密議定、在中日改訂商約期内、各路日輪、均增添新船、爲對付我國收回航權之預備、各日商業在銳進中、大連汽船會社·特在上海營口間、增闢新航綫一條、預備派四輪行駛、該社爲謀打倒此路之華商航業計、特造四千至五千噸之强速率油機輪四艘、即天山丸·崑山丸·千山丸·等輪是、原擬三月下旬開班、營口之各華商得訊、恐航權商運、被其壟斷、即經各商帮議定同盟抵制、拒装日輪、故該社之營口船祗開一次、便即止航、擬俟形勢和緩、再行駛往、而航路並未撤除也、</p>
<p>廣州船稅爭執　招商局粵分局長董福開電滬、謂廣州關稅監督、對于輪船進口、近頃變更新制、該局赴粵船舶、須具保證、否則每一船、易繳證金三千元、粵局因未曾照此辦理、即命令不許缷貨、妨碍</p>
<p>運輸、並阻延船期云云、滬局得報、已去電向粵海關交涉矣、</p>

<p>外輪去貨减少　在最近數日中、上海長江出口貨、突然銳落、其主因一爲上游各埠之罷工風潮、一係平漢路聯運阻斷、而贛省内地、與沙宜一帶、又土匪蜂起、各該處富有之人民、多向上海逃避而求安全、商帮亦各停辦貨物、致上水貨、頓然大减、近日洋商轉口貨、亦多不装往、自本月一日起、滬上洋商輪之出口貨、僅有三四成儎脚、本來長江班内、英日各外輪、每船出口、其所收水脚、至少可收六七千兩者、邇日每次出口、不過二千餘兩運費矣、</p>

<h3>常遇春之襪</h3>
<p>— 張炎</p>
<p>大明名將推徐常。達性仁慈。恂恂有儒者風。迄今子姓繁衍。忠武嗜殺後嗣不繁。揚州之卸甲橋。即忠武封王之遺跡。而小東門内之常府巷。亦即忠武府第之遺址也。有淸中葉。常姓式微。迺遷往揚州北鄉黃玗橋落户焉。予之佃户常國泰者。即忠武公後裔也。忠武之遺影尙存。予嘗一展視之。狀貌魁梧。面長黎黑修眉環眼。髯長尺餘。雙耳幾長三寸。冠金盔。衣大紅金繡蟒袍。虎虎若生。望之令人生怖。最可貴者。該佃家尙存有忠武之錦襪一隻。係黃緞製成。盤金繡花。襪統幾長三尺。襪底圍圓尺七八。寬及八寸。襪巨如此。則軀幹壯偉可知。聞襪内能藏米一斗。誠巨足矣。國泰每逢夏日。必出晒一次。至今尙什襲珍藏。永以爲寳云。</p>
<h3>蒸汽車試用記</h3>
<p>— 蘭茜</p>
<p>三月三十一日早上。紀念週的儀式旣完。我們各自回房公幹。九時三刻。和氣的郁ＣＳ到我們這裏來。說「淞滬支綫今日試用蒸汽自動車。諸位如有空閑。不妨先行乘趁一次。」等因奉此。我們房裏約有二十餘人。除了三位没有加入外。其餘各人都踴躍參加。站上已有二三百人在簽名。中外男女的來賓也很多。各報館的新聞記者。郵政局代表。海軍司令部代表等等。路員有劉司令長羅顧問到劉總管諸位。熱閙非常。　　我們上了車。對於車上的各種設備。覺得舒服逾常。頭等座位尤其新頴。籐椅靠背可以前後移轉。來回可以免倒行。每部有車二座。（三等）每座可容納百五千人。没有二等車。像電車一樣只有頭三等。開車次數。四月一日前。新車未用。每日只開二十二次。現在增加到七十四次。其便當爲何如呢。　　十時車乃開駛。行動時很爲安定。無顚播之苦。每人的面部都飽含笑意。氣象煥然一新。象徵出許多希望。　　這一回是特别快車。所過各站都不停靠。夾道行人。舉欣欣然有喜色而相告曰。「那是蒸汽自動車啊。多有趣。」小孩子們尤其快活。在溪旁的草地上狂跳歡呼。我們都笑了。　　一路上桃紅枊綠。春光又在人間。水聲與機聲齊唱。人語共鳥語交喧。行三十分鐘。砲臺灣到了。　　三百人一齊下了車。劉司長羅顧問劉總管伴着了幾位外賓爲首。步至吳淞江邊的應接室去。是地空氣淸新。胸襟爲之一暢。江上小帆片片。白水茫茫。作者呆看移時。乃隨衆入席。享用茶點。秩序整然。非常莊重。　　劉司長讀了總理遺囑後。便報告購買蒸汽車的經過及其對於各路（淞滬。支綫耳。）的改良的願望。聽衆鼓掌。就是座上的十來個碧眼兒不知他在說些什麽。也照例拍掌。　　後來各報記者演說。各代表演說。來賓演說。茶點畢。共攝影於站上新車前。以留記念。</p>
<h3>記新騙術</h3>
<p>— 靑石居士</p>
<p>搭客絡繹好歹莫辨。廢曆臘月。余由南橋外舅家回里。例必乘划船以行爲時尙早。艙中虚無人。余乃檢一潔凈處。蹲身倚舷而坐。探懷出袖珍小說。披覽以破寥寂。計良得也。時舟子從事装貨。如韓信將兵。多多益善。而乘客之絡繹於船者。或如商賈。或似小販。踵相接。項相望也。装貨竣。船啟椗。衆客亦開始談笑。議論風生。爲狀至樂。而不知一片談笑聲中。局騙之暗幕。乃自此種因矣。　　留神觀察知非善類　坐余右旁之客。口操浦東音。向對座一客通欵曲。至叩姓字里居甚詳。操浦東音者爲張三寳。而其對座之客。姓王而名昌士。執業於平湖某烟肆。據云因年關伊邇。來此結束客賬。今更乘便赴松。與某烟紙業淸算。以便回平交代。張客驟聞之下。曲膝圈坐。自動言肆。注視其所携行囊。想不少黃白物。恨不攫之以行。時余方掩卷整襟。凝神默察。見其目灼灼似賊。固一望而决其非善類。而王客尙在五里霧中。倍加親密。或以捲烟見餉。或以果餌相敬。報李投桃。幾同莫逆。余因冥思遐想。以素昧平生而投契若此。定必有不可思議者在焉。　　目的達到人影杳然　　須臾抵葉榭鎭。舟遂停駛。張乃邀王至酒家覓飲。王並不推辭。相將登岸。余亦安步入酒肆。踽踽獨坐。二人已沽飲。飲畢更爭先作東道主。而張已捷足先得。且謂王曰。此戔戔者。何足掛齒。王逐將小皮囊置案上。以便再與委蛇。轉瞬張假大便爲名。健步下樓。王亦漫不留神。啜茗回視。忽失所在。盤問酒保。則云除却三人。别無生客。焉有不翼而飛之理。追踪至船。此公杳如黃鶴。王始悟彼一匪人。其所以如此殷勤。窺我行囊甚富。早已垂涎三尺。乘此機會下手。託故先行。此時舟子刻不及待。鼓浪開松。王亦未如之何。祗得狼狽登舟。據云此内儲鈔洋八十四元。小洋十五角。而彼所費酒資。僅一元六角有奇。余笑應之曰。彼與君素不相識。而一見如故。目的固别有專注。旁觀者早知其有大欲存焉。君自大意而未覺察。苟稍留神。彼亦無從下手。君與彼一塲沽飲。竟可算小吃大會鈔。而彼以一元有零之破費。換得摺壘之鈔幣。所謂金田螺釣玉蟹也。王唯唯</p>
<h3>佛龕藏匣記</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>海上收藏炎柴匣面者。有二人焉。一爲徐卓呆。一爲錢化佛。而化佛瘁十餘年之心力。所蓄尤富。揭黏於紙夾。如册頁然。都千數百種。以東灜物爲多。匣面有美麗之圖案。或爲風景。或爲靜物。或爲花卉羽蟲。或爲人體黑影。其色調能於妍中含有雅逸氣。且有列日曜表以便檢查者。有金碧輝煌。標御大典。萬歲等字典。以爲臨時慶祝者。不啻郵政之有紀念票也。牌號大都爲食堂。料理館。其他銀行。吳服店。新聞社。亦有所點綴。蓋東灜人士。對於廣告。不遺餘力。每一商店。必備特製之火柴。藉匣面爲廣告。用以贈送主顧。其收效自較勝尋常傳單倍蓰也。觀至此。化佛更出一錦函。縱寸許。橫六七分。書根染以金彩。宛然小卷帙也。及函封旣解。則火柴匣之精緻者耳。爲之失笑。瑞士。英吉利者。匣面較闊。印以偉人之像。使人動敬仰之思。後附吾國之土物。如元寳。寳塔。雙錢。蝙蝠等。圖紋惡俗呆板。無審美觀念。對之悶損。深願吾國火柴商亟起改良。而臻眞美善之境也。化佛又示其所藏名㓨。絕怪異者。有蒙古人之片。姓名有十餘字之多。累累贅贅。難以記憶。圖書館家杜定友之片。如無瑕白壁。惟左角鐫有極而細小之杜定友三字。雖不能盡得風流。而自具趣致。書寫條札。尤爲便易。法至善也。某君之片。爲孫中山先生手書。因附識說明。的是創格。新劇先導王鐘聲。於片上印有玉影。作西式装。儀態甚佳。鐘聲一字熙普。爲革命而流血。洵可風之烈士也。是曰名優金碧艷亦在座。相與笑譚觀賞者久之。</p>
<h3>步行抵京記（上）</h3>
<p>— 全國步行團員劉漢儒</p>
<p>敝團於二月二十日　由滬出發、計費時四旬。行抵首都。第一步計畫告一小段落。叨承滬上關心敝團人士。羣函詢問狀况。不及一一裁答。爰借自由談。作一簡單報告。篇幅所限。未能詳陳種切。幸鑒原焉。</p>
<p>二月二十日晨。吾等齊集北站大旅社。行装甚簡。每人背囊一。毛氈一。飯包一。水瓶一。餘則攝影機及儀器等件。八時半歡送人士。及各公團均至。期望敝團之熱忱。溢於言表。良可感也。八時三刻。與諸君子握手告别。沿鐡路前進十時二十五分。抵眞茹。曁大特開敎職員會歡送。並餉以茶點。暢聆沈如桂桐侯候二先生之敎益。復送至楊家橋始返。拳拳盛意。至爲感佩。當晚宿於南翔鎭公所。翌晨六時起程。沿河赴嘉定。十時許抵該縣城。承民衆敎育館陸館長引至各處參觀。晚間楊敎育局長並設讌爲同人洗塵。二十二日晨離嘉定赴太倉。因各人肩上負物件太重。平均每人有三十餘斤。蓋在嘉定曾取縣志及印刷品等件作參考。故甚笨重也。乃雇一獨車。專推各人背囊。如此步行。則輕便多矣。十二時許抵太倉城。縣商會派員歡迎。招待庽新旅社。晚間縣黨部並開茶會歡迎。二十三日晨擬赴崑山。詢鄉人至崑山路程。應如何走。有答以無路可走。有告以僅小路可通。事先已將背囊託帶至崑山電話局。無奈仍出西門步行前進。離城五里許。有一廣東新村。曰振東農鄉。取振發廣東之意。係美洲返國之僑胞别墅。村内均廣東人。因領隊謝君係粵人。要求參觀。承概允。並留午膳。二時許告辭。途中　係田埂之路。實無大路可走。五時抵崑山城。在崑躭擱一日。除至各機關外。並游馬鞍山。歸墓及鄉先祠等。二十五日。沿鐡道往蘇州。八時三十分由車站出發。晚六時抵蘇州。因團員梁君係省立農專學生。故庽該校。休息兩日。整理數日來之紀錄。游虎邱寒山寺滄浪亭留園等處。</p>
<h3>東游通訊（二）</h3>
<p>— 吳孝侯</p>
<p>乙社會敎育　長崎社會敎育。有著名圖書館二。並博物館公園等。二圖書館中。以長崎縣立圖書館設備最稱完美。記者至該館時。適館長永山時英氏。因公外出。由事務部主任增田廉吉氏出而接待。全館共分三大部、（一）閱覽及辦事室宿舍等。係用木造。二層樓。占地三百餘畝。内置普通閱覽室。特别閱覽室。婦人閱覽室。新聞閱覽室。兒童閱覽室。史料陳列室。食堂。館長室。事務室。宿舍室等。（二）書庫一所。係用水泥鋼骨所建。三層樓。占地三十坪。（三）製本室。置物室。小使室（即僕役室）等。係木建。平房。占地五十三坪。以上三大部外。尙有餘屋空塲等。共合占地一千一百四十九坪。該館儲藏圖書六萬餘册、經費全年二萬餘元。職員共二十五人。館内特設有私人藏書室。内儲聖敎書五册。尙係三百年前西歷一千六百零七年之物。極爲珍視。又德人希伯兒懸像一幀。詢係德之海軍軍官。爲在日本開國以來傳授外國語之第一人。日人爲置縣像於入國第一埠之長崎圖書館。亦追念前勞。藉留永紀之意也。</p>
<p>長崎環境皆山。公園倚山建築。層遞而上。風景絕佳。惟長崎爲日要塞之一。禁止攝影。殊爲憾事。所幸索得長崎縣圖書館全景一幘。製版附刊本報。片中市衢整潔。花木扶疏。亦可得窺長崎風景之一斑矣。</p>
<p>長崎旣爲由華赴日第一埠。吾華人之往僑該地者。因之亦衆。以經商爲多。工業次之。亦間有爲僧侶者。記者曾至該埠東門寺。見寺内建有前淸中華商會會長蘇道生君紀念石碑一座。寺僧搨碑字以贈來游者。視爲古跡之一。又至崇福寺。詢悉該寺係三百餘年前僧人即非所募建。即非僧爲吾華閩籍人。明末亡命至長崎。穩其姓氏。削髮爲僧。記者當以不得即非僧之姓氏復留心遍覽各處。終發見寺之中門兩旁。有石刻「天空海闊無雙地。虎伏龍歸不二門。」一聯。筆力遒勁。下欵署「　　」二字。始卿即非僧俗家之刻字乎。</p>

<h3>洋釐超出二分關外</h3>
<p>市塲槪况　昨日市塲氣象、仍與前數日不相興替、惟外界稍有走銷、人心轉昂、雖無特殊高抬、而已超出二分關外矣、銀根需途、依然疏懈、銀行頭襯、連日有出欵、是故形勢終無好面江南小洋、已轉定勢、大槪需時已過、又復告寂耳、</p>
<p>釐拆價格　洋釐久無生氣、昨早似稍挺秀、計早市仍爲七錢二分、與前日毫無差異、午市加昂三毫七忽半、爲七錢二分○三毫七忽半、人心俏利、厥後有轉機希望、銀拆形勢、久疲不堪、始終無望生色、昨日早午市又復做出三分、較前日仍跌二分、劃頭亦無加水、氣象一蹶不振、逆料今年銀根、似無高涨之憂矣、</p>
<p>輔弊市情　江南小洋、前兩日小同行因受外行委托、略買數萬、致市價突然高昂、昨則聲</p>
<p>息又寂、故市價已趨弱途、而不復動擅矣、計早午兩市均爲六錢二分、較前日午小去五釐、做出交易僅早市一千五百角、廣東小洋、則轉高一釐、計早午兩市皆開五錢九分八釐半、做出交</p>
<p>易、早市十四萬五千角、午市四萬角、銅元縮短三千文、爲三百九十三千、較前日形勢加緊不少</p>
<p>交易仍有三萬餘串、</p>
<p>銀洋進出　「銀欵」連日銀行收解、鑒於錢莊業務不甚擴充、故各種收解、亦殊簡略、昨日華商各銀行收解票欵一百七十餘萬、外商各銀</p>
<p>行收解票欵不及百萬、各種貨匯稅什諸盤收解九百餘萬、絲出欵四十餘萬、出倉二百十萬、日商銀行收解各欵二百七八十萬、進倉三址十萬、錢莊銀行單收解二吉千七百餘萬、劃頭欵收解三百四十餘萬、各路匯欵收解一百十餘萬、收現七八十萬、「洋欵」匯劃票欵、早市做出一百十二萬五千、午市做出五十四萬、鈔票祗午市一萬、塲外</p>

<h3>三月份存息二兩</h3>
<p>本屆三月份存息、業經前日錢業公會常會提議、决定爲二兩九五扣、按此次銀拆統計、本祗九錢、故銀根雖鬆、而存户方面、尙佔便宜耳、至於欠息、仍由舊例規定、作四兩半坐盤遞加、最高息價、仍不過十兩零五錢、次者不過七八兩之譜、查往年二三月間、（除去年外）總在四五兩之存息、而今年照此金貴銀賤之局面推測、恐無高昂之銀拆矣、</p>

<p>頗形安靜、商塲上多數目標、須看再回涨二兩、將見一百五十三四兩、然賣方大户、心思仍低底貨雄厚、抵補之念未絕、多空兩方相持甚力但海外花紗市况、涨風稍定、前途仍依時局及實銷爲根本、紗交自明日起、停市二日、至七日照常營業云、</p>
<p>人標續涨一兩外　人標前市開盤、外棉回跌、人心平淡、時局空氣依然不佳、散户多數看跌、然開拍後因有六十八號在近三月購進、故市氣尤緊　近涨七九錢至一兩、遠涨　四錢、午後標紗因經紀赴杭游覽、提早一點請開市、形勢仍堅、近月六十八號仍買進九百五十包、</p>

<h3>棉市穩定如故</h3>
<p>棉市仍堅、但美棉稍跌、此爲大漲後之小跌、於市面無重大關係、故本埠人心仍然觀高、加之底貨次缺、漢帮拉緊不放、故市盤一時殊不易趨跌也、但實際交易尙淸、各廠態度亦甚呆云、</p>
<p>期貨跌而復涨　漢標前市開盤、以外棉回跌而軟、各月跌五分至一錢、午後市况稍堅、以</p>

<h3>糧食米市跌勢轉烈</h3>
<p>惟南市尙平</p>
<p>閘北　昨日各路來原源仍旺、雖屬陰雨、到船亦有四十餘號、但買胃異常淸淡、北粳又跌兩角外、計兩日中回落半元之多、可稱涨銳而跌亦烈也、薄稻銷塲粳米呆、斛脚寥寥無幾、市盤續短兩</p>
<p>三角、羊埠秈到貨不旺、去路因洋米狂跌影響、一律觀望、行情見疲近角、至於通變陰元、買氣沉寂、到銷兩淡、高貨十八元左右、</p>
<p>滬南　河下到船十號左右、街銷平平、常錫帮機粳高者銷活堅定、次者微有修削、市氣尙可、蘇同帮白粳鄉莊頗有問津、惟因北市不振、吃價極緊、大盤均乏上落、南帮薄稻·早稻、寗帮進意雖淡、然貨客扳售、價格因乃平定、杜子秈與羊秈來貨寥寥、客胃沉靜、盤面受洋料軋脚、致難開展、洋米公會因市價上落甚鉅、成交均須一律現金、並再增加保證金、投機者大受影響、交易旣少、買户亦稀、價乃一落千丈矣、白元頂貨殊俏、中次貨厚平平、情况仍鮮榮辱、</p>
<h3>洋米跌價後之旺銷</h3>
<p>晨跌二角··午涨二角　　昨日洋米上午開價後、回籠貨競爲售出、現貨亦抑價求脫、致現米又跌二角、期米亦水近錢、市價跌小後、忽引起本街鄉莊内地各客爭辦、市價乃又立涨二角、結果與前市無大出入、形勢反見疲定、統市期貨售開回籠貨三千餘噸、洋行抛售者有小絞三四月份二千四百噸、現貨開出一萬餘包、路貨成交五千包、均係本街鄉莊内地等辦去云、</p>
<h3>麵粉市景俏麗</h3>
<p>昨日粉市開市後、各月份市面、與前市無大出入、惟聞洋麥略好、而北洋帮更有購買期現各貨、市上氣壓見緊張、廠家因有客帮問津、不復再出、北帮除装現之外、又搜買四五六月期貨、因此浮空紛紛抵補、内地抛售者亦爲觀望不出、最後結果四月大七厘半、五六月七八月各大一分、九月份大大厘云、</p>
<h3>小麥趨上之勢</h3>
<p>昨日小麥市况、開市時各月份均形疲軟、本月份竟無隻包成交、繼聞粉市轉機、現麥又有廠化、人心用均轉好、午後麵粉有北帮購辦、空頭遂爭先抵補、近遠各月份隨即紛紛上涨、收市本月份大二分、六七月份各大二分、八月大三分、九月大二分、現貨廠辦仍佳、統市開出五六千包、高貨貨乏尤佳、中次亦站、結果均比前市見好一二分云、</p>
<h3>期餅平穩</h3>
<p>昨日標準期邊餅交易頗佳、裏路客帮買意極活、而閩浙帮亦有問津、故六月上下期餅均覺秀麗、價因大連產電不動、及本埠號家抛售、致呈平穩、仍開六兩八錢二分半、期連豆則進出淸靜、未有做開、</p>
<h3>疋頭　疋頭轉呈呆滯</h3>
<p>疋交漸形見靜、内地帮採辦、大有告一段落、以時屆廢歷淸明、俗例出外經商者、紛紛回里掃墓、故抵申者日形稀少、公會上亦呈淸淡之狀、客帮因受時局影響、暫時尙難轉機、尤以四川帮之淸淡爲最、實以上半年運去過夥、加以大局不安、以致一厥不振、長江帮需要零星、昨寗波温州等帮稍有添辦、貨價尙堅、東貨縐綢嗶嘰依然活動、昨天賜財源百子圖均開二錢三分二厘半、湖心亭二錢四分、風波亭二錢四分二厘半、寳球二錢七分二厘半、直貢緞復略見軟、第一功手貨售二錢五分二厘半、四學士二錢四分七厘半、三馬頭二錢四分半、西貨素洋紗因値銷令、日漸活澄潑、昨泰和之如意天官什色十二兩、義記金危危十一兩七錢半、泰和閙天宮十兩零五錢、本客均有辦法、白條麻紗夕明交法印花縐綢亦頗活動云、</p>

<h3>五金　粗鉛絲軍界採辦甚動</h3>
<p>八號·十號·十二號以及十四號粗鉛絲、近數日來軍界生意甚熱閙、統計被購有二千餘担、而繼後之趕辦者、大有人在、但市貨自經收羅之後、流存頓感缺乏、標準節節上進、比前市涨起二三錢之鉅、計八號每担售八兩、十號八兩二錢半、十二號九兩、十四號九兩五錢、查目下到貨極鮮、預料行情或須繼續進展也、</p>
<h3>絲茶　滙率不堅影響絲銷</h3>
<p>日來歐美滙率、忽縮忽升、洋莊銷不克繼暢、歐電轉滬漸稀、滬埠各歐莊僅補充缺貨、新交易殊難進展、華絲商手貨不充、價小不售、昨祗華通等進滬白廠經五十包、乾利進貨黃廠經二十包、克昌沔陽絲八包、價尙堅定云、</p>

<p>社會消息</p>
<h3>維也納古宮的出賣</h3>
<p>奧皇族末路的悲哀</p>
<p>奥地利亞十年來的革命高潮、把維也納許多壯麗的皇宮、偉大的建築、弄成一種人去樓空的凄凉現象、從前王公大臣的邱邸、現在已經在那塵封的大門上、貼着「此屋出賣」的招貼了、</p>
<p>從前的貴族、在「社會主義」的壓迫下、受着極重大的稅捐、現在他們的生</p>
<p>活、已經無所謂舒適、更談不到貴族與否了、雖則維也納仍是和從前一樣的繁華、一樣的是黛玉河畔Ｔｈｅ·Ｄａｎｕｂｅ　Ｒｊｖｅ一個奢麗的都市、然而今昔不同、她已經不能再被稱爲歐羅巴最美麗的帝都了、</p>
<p>這些在歷史上令人低徊的宮殿、現在怎樣呢、哎呀、當拍賣行把那些珍貴的畫像、精美的地氈、以及其他宮内種種歷代相傳的珍寳賣出之後、現代的那些帶着商人氣息的陳設、就快要連袂地進來擺架子了、從前皇家的會議室、現在要變</p>
<p>成飯廳、從前穿黑色制服的侍臣、現在要委屈他們來做供人呼喚的奴僕、於是有錢的商人們、馬上就成了貴族、</p>
<p>然而在事實上、這麽偉大的皇宮、有誰肯花錢來買呢、因爲普通的人家、無論他的家庭大到怎樣的程度、一經到皇宮之内、就要覺得空虚、而一點也不能享受着舒適、裏面的房間、是那麽空廓、你要</p>

Zhu’s conversations at the various embassies were brief. The Pingjin Executive Department of the Party was formally established today and will host journalists on the 4th. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) I visited a certain embassy a moment ago to inquire about the attitude of the diplomatic corps toward diplomatic correspondence. The embassy official said that it had not yet been discussed. Given the current situation, Zhu Hexiang should be regarded as a foreign affairs representative of the local government. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) An envoy of Yan Xishan arrived at various embassies this morning, stating that Yan had assumed the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Republic of China.

(3rd Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yan Xishan's declaration to foreign countries was delivered to the British, American, and Japanese embassies by the Foreign Affairs Department of the Headquarters at 4:00 PM this afternoon. The attitude of the diplomatic corps is one of observation, and they seem to have agreed to exchange opinions with each other at any time when foreign affairs arise. As for the misappropriation of customs surplus, there are already precedents to follow. In today's recognized autonomy, there is only silent acquiescence. (3rd Day Japanese United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhu Hexiang went to the British Embassy on the afternoon of the 3rd and formally delivered Yan Xishan's declaration to foreign countries. An official from the British Embassy told a United Press reporter, "This is indeed a major issue, but it is also a frequently seen phenomenon.

<p>(Beiping) The New Morning Post reports that Xie Chi, Tan Zhen, and Zou Lu stated that they only held two meetings with Chen Gongbo and Wang Faqin in Beiping this time and that there were no results. It is too early to talk about a joint declaration. It is also a slight error to regard it as a joint session. If a method of great unity of comrades is purely adopted, it will be another matter. It also states that the establishment of a standing committee was originally a mediation plan and has not been finalized. Now that Chen and Wang have gone to Taiyuan, all issues are at a standstill.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>After the Issuance of the Japanese Reply</h3>
<p>The reply to the naval limitation convention, concerning the fate and future of the convention and Japan's fundamental national policy, was issued after many days of consideration and discussion. Its special solemnity can be generally seen. The reason why the Japanese authorities delayed in deciding on this semi-concessionary reply was, on the one hand, to accommodate the wishes of the United States and reduce the crisis of a breakdown of the naval conference, and on the other hand, to retain the demand for 70% of the US's tonnage of capital ships and to ease the opposition of the naval faction. It cannot be said that this was not the painstaking effort of the Japanese authorities. However, after the issuance of this reply, will the British and American sides be able to fully agree with this reservation without any problems? Will the naval faction be able to fully understand this reply without any repercussions? This is still unknown. According to today's Japanese telegrams, although there is talk of an agreement being reached between the three countries on capital ships, the British and American representatives have not yet expressed any opinion on the content of this reply, and there are still many unresolved issues, so it cannot be readily considered a satisfactory solution. As for the attitude of the naval faction, it remains strongly opposed. Although Prime Minister Hamaguchi summoned the Vice-Minister of the Navy, etc., to request understanding, and the plenipotentiary representative, Zaibu, summoned the naval committee and tried his best to appease them, many still expressed dissatisfaction. Moreover, the opponents are not only in the military, but the House of Peers also expressed indignation at the government's softening. Today's national conference in Tokyo also believes that the reply endangers national defense and unanimously expressed opposition. Judging from this situation, the opposition party has been given an opportunity to impeach the government. Therefore, it is not impossible for disputes in the Japanese political situation to arise from this case. Even if this case is fortunate enough not to affect the political situation, how to use the expenses saved after the implementation of military reduction will also be a problem for future disputes. Only if these expenses can be fully transferred to education or to supplement tax cuts to ease the burden on the people will there be real benefits to the country. If, as the military intends, to remedy the defects in the national defense plan because of the military reduction, and transfer these expenses to enrich the content of the navy, it will be no different from not reducing the military. What benefit will the people get from military reduction? Therefore, it is predicted that the military and the people will inevitably argue about this issue.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Meeting</h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The Provincial Government held its 280th meeting on the 3rd. Wang Boqun, He Yushu, Chen Qicai, Li Mingyang, Sun Hongzhe, Luo Liangjian, Hu Puan, and Ye Chucang attended. The chairman was Ye Chucang. Matters discussed: (1) President Chiang telegraphed that the motor road from Jurong to Zhenjiang and to the Zhejiang border should be paved within three months, and the roads from Nanjing to Dangtu, etc., should continue to be carried out according to the previously determined work plan. (Resolution: Order the construction and finance departments to comply quickly. (2) Chairman Ye proposed to investigate that there are nine members of this government, and that the reason why there are non-concurrent department members is that the concurrent department members are limited in spirit and time, so they are specially set up to facilitate provincial administration. The intention is very good, but judging from the past situation in this province, it seems that it has not been fully utilized. As far as the humble view is concerned, it is proposed to formulate the following methods for the office of non-concurrent department members: (1) The government shall set up an office for department members; (2) The cases decided by the committee meeting and submitted for review shall be sent to the office for review. If there is consultation, the head of the competent department or his representative may be invited to the government to contact; (3) Daily official affairs of the government, such as documents and dispatches related to civil administration, public security, finance, education, construction, agriculture, mining, party affairs, and judiciary, shall be drafted or drafted by the Secretariat and sent to the committee office for review, and shall be signed by the chairman. If this can be done, the effect of cooperation can still be achieved in the division of labor, and the spirit and facts can both benefit. Is it appropriate, and is it still subject to public decision? Resolution: Passed. (3) The Civil Affairs Department selected Zhang Pengxi and Huang Naizhen to act as magistrates of Siyang and Donghai counties. Resolution: Passed. (4) The Food Regulation Association函, 1,500 tons of rice will arrive in Saigon, please pre-plan all aspects of the matter.

(5) Resolution: The old debts of this province should be sorted out quickly and separately, and the Finance Department should be ordered to submit a method for sorting them out.

<h3>Naval Conference Situation Improves</h3>
<p>General Assembly Postponed Indefinitely, Anglo-French Negotiations Underway</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd - The Five-Power Naval Conference issued a communique today stating that the Japanese chief delegate, Wakatsuki, declared at a meeting of chief delegates that he had received a reply from the Japanese government regarding the Anglo-American-Japanese compromise proposal. The reply stated that the Japanese government, desiring to actively cooperate to promote the success of the conference, proposed to accept the proposal with certain reservations. The details of the reservations still need to be discussed. The British Prime Minister said that he and the American chief delegate expressed deep appreciation for the spirit and substance of the reply. The General Assembly, originally scheduled for April 4th, has now been postponed indefinitely because Anglo-French talks are currently underway. It is not appropriate to interrupt them at this time, nor is it appropriate to publicly announce their content, which would be detrimental. According to Reuters, it is impossible to say whether the Naval Conference can be completed before Easter.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd - Tonight, the American delegation is quite optimistic. Secretary of State Stimson told American journalists that the situation has greatly improved since last week. Today, they are more optimistic about a five-power agreement than they were last week.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American-Japanese Agreement Established</h3>
<p>Postponement of Battleship Construction; Supplementary Vessel Holdings Also Determined</p>

<p>Great Britain: 539,900 tons</p>
<p>United States: 526,200 tons</p>
<p>Japan: 367,000 tons</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd - The Japanese delegate to the Naval Conference published an article confirming the news that the Japanese government has actually accepted the Anglo-American proposal regarding the ratio between Japan and the United States, but contains an important reservation, namely that the current treaty is valid until the end of 1936, after which Japan may request a complete reconsideration of the entire issue.</p>
<h3>National Rally for Disarmament Held in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Declaration Opposing Re-Training Approved</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hamaguchi Seeks Understanding from All Parties</p>
<p>Japan United Press, Tokyo, 3rd - The National Disarmament Rally was held at Shiba Park at 1:00 PM on the 3rd. Two thousand listeners gathered, and two hundred police officers were deployed to maintain order. The following declaration was approved: "The Japanese people believe that this disarmament and re-training endangers our national defense and therefore absolutely oppose it." Subsequently, a speech meeting was held, and Lieutenant General Yamaji and others took the stage to speak. At 5:00 PM, the crowd shouted "Banzai" three times and dispersed.</p>
<p>Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, 3rd - The Japanese government intends to use part of the financial resources remaining from this disarmament to enrich the content of the navy, and the remainder will be used to implement tax cuts from next year. It is heard that the national treasury will bear the cost of compulsory education to the extent of 1,000 yuan. After the disarmament agreement is established, a tax system reorganization plan and a two-tax reduction plan will be studied and submitted to the ordinary parliament for implementation. The goal is to alleviate the sugar consumption tax, textile consumption tax, and business income tax. Finance Minister Inoue said regarding this matter, "How to use the remaining financial resources as a result of disarmament cannot be determined at present, because the suspension of battleship construction and the age of supplementary ships have not yet been determined. However, there will undoubtedly be a large amount of financial resources left over. As for its use, in addition to part of it being used for the navy's enrichment expenses, the majority is intended to be used to reduce consumption taxes."</p>
<p>Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, 3rd - Prime Minister Hamaguchi is quite worried about the situation regarding the re-training plan and is seeking understanding from the military and others. Vice Minister Yamaga visited in the morning on the 2nd, and in the afternoon, he invited Vice Minister Yabuki and Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff Suetsugu to the official residence to explain the subsequent trends. Vice Chief Suetsugu, after leaving the official residence, told people that the Chief of the Naval General Staff issued a statement after visiting the Imperial Palace on the morning of the 2nd, stating that he could not agree with the re-training plan, which was a different belief. At this time, there was no way to decide on this major re-training plan, only showing this plan to one or two officials before the cabinet meeting, and whether or not it could be approved was known. Today's national defense plan cannot be achieved in a day or two, and it is clear that he cannot agree with this public re-training plan, but it has already been decided by the government, and there is no way to reverse it. At present, the only thing to do is to study whether this plan can fill the gap in the national defense plan.</p>
<h3>The Future of the German New Cabinet</h3>
<p>The National People's Party Shows a Public Split</p>
<p>The Social Democratic Party Vigorously Attacks Government Policies</p>
<p>National Press, Berlin, 2nd - The National People's Party is showing increasing signs of division. The more radical elements are still engaged in propaganda against the Brüning cabinet, demanding that the Social Democratic Party add a vote of no confidence. However, the more moderate faction believes that the new cabinet's plan to help farmers has met the wishes of the National People's Party and accepts Brüning's views. Therefore, the German parliament will postpone the discussion of the new cabinet's major policies until tomorrow to give the radical elements of the National People's Party time to reconsider. If they still insist on opposing it, the new cabinet will fail and the party will inevitably split. At today's meeting of the National People's Party, Social Democratic leader Breitscheid vigorously attacked government policies and warned the government against a dictatorial attitude towards the people, saying that the party would fight to the death against it. However, the majority of parliamentarians expressed satisfaction with the new cabinet's efforts to pull the country out of the vortex of party strife.</p>
<h3>Russian Anti-Religious Incident</h3>
<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury States his Views, Requests the British Government to Submit to Russian Representatives</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd - The Archbishop of Canterbury raised the issue of Russian anti-religious incidents in the Upper House today, saying that he had done his best to investigate the facts impartially and was confident that he could prove that Russia was still implementing an anti-religious system. He had received reports that the Russian government had sentenced 71 religious figures to death by shooting and 112 to prison terms of two to ten years last year. Some people said that criticizing the Russian government was tantamount to threatening war, which he strongly disagreed with. He believed that the British government should submit the following points to the attention of Russian representatives: (1) Equality of public rights for religious believers and other civilians; (2) Opportunities for workers to observe the Sabbath and religious festivals during the five-day week; (3) Religious instructional books should be allowed to be published and circulated; (4) Abolish restrictions on the assembly and instruction of children; (5) Release religious believers who are emaciated and dying in prisons in the Arctic region; (6) Stop the widespread closure of churches. Lord Balfour, President of the Privy Council, replied that he could not fully agree with the points stated by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The truth or falsehood of various events in Russia is not within the scope of any government's investigation. He knew that there had been some anti-religious tragedies last year, but they have now improved. The British government is willing to use all its power to promote religious freedom, but if Russia does not violate the conditions of British recognition of Soviet Russia, the British government does not want to sever diplomatic relations. Today's situation is not as terrible as at any time in the past ten years. As for education, it is purely an internal affair of foreign governments, and any government that wants to intervene must meet the following two conditions: (1) Conclusive proof that the measures taken are inappropriate, extremely serious, and a concern to the entire civilized world; (2) Certainty that the intervention will not make the harm even worse; otherwise, it should not be done. If maintaining anti-communication in the future may have the opportunity to dredge up the Russian government, the external affairs department will carefully consider the points raised by the Archbishop.</p>

<h3>Polish Internal Disputes</h3>
<p>The Government Party's Power is Weak</p>
<p>National Press, Warsaw, 2nd - Polish Prime Minister General Slavik declared to government party members that the government could not occupy a majority in the current parliament, so it would not allow them to reassemble, etc. Therefore, it is expected that Poland will hold a general election soon. However, Poland has already convened a parliament, so the Young Plan and the German-Polish and French-Polish commercial agreements cannot be ratified. Its internal disputes will affect the international community, and general opinion is that Slavik has no intention of hastily organizing elections, because it is uncertain whether the government party can win.</p>

<h3>Case of the Disappearance of the White Russian Leader in France</h3>
<p>National Press, Paris, 2nd - Regarding the case of the disappearance of White Russian leader General Kutepov, investigating judge Perrier personally went to the Naumontai beach to conduct an on-site investigation.

It is expected that this Russian woman was Kutepov in disguise.</p>
<h3>Australian Government Cracks Down on Luxury Goods</h3>
<p>Reuters, 3rd, Capital of New South Wales, Australia -</p>
<p>Prime Minister Scullin declared that the government plans to implement a severe plan to reduce imports of luxury goods, banning the import of several types, and imposing heavy taxes on others, such as beer, alcohol, matches, cloth, leather goods, cotton, silk, and rayon fabrics. Mr. Shi said that the government's actions are an emergency plan to reduce annual imports to 10 million gold pounds. It is estimated that imports in 1927-28 were worth a total of 143.6 million pounds.</p>
<h3>The United States Begins to Investigate Households</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 3rd - The work of investigating households in the United States has already begun. The last investigation was ten years ago. At that time, there were a total of 105,710,600 people. It is estimated that it has increased by 17 million people in the last ten years. There are a total of 120,000 staff members handling the investigation affairs. The household name table issued to the people has many questions, especially in the occupation item, which is very detailed. For example, how many weeks have you been working at your current job, how many days have you been working last week, how many weeks have you been unemployed, can you work, do you want to find a job, etc. are all required to be answered one by one. The reason for this is that Green, the president of the American Federation of Labor, reported to the Senate Unemployment Committee on Tuesday that there were nearly 4 million unemployed people in the United States in February.</p>
<h3>American Company High-Level Agreement</h3>
<p>National Press, Washington, 2nd - The Pacific Passenger Joint Conference Agreement negotiated by American, Canadian, and Australian shipping companies, Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, Los Xunqi Ersi Shipping Company, Changxing Company, Dalei Company, Matuoxun Shipping Company, New York Wheel Company, United Wheel Company, etc., has been approved by the American Shipping Bureau today.

After this agreement is established, all companies must strictly adhere to the fares they have announced. Any reduction or free of charge is prohibited unless agreed upon by all companies. This method will be carried out indefinitely, but if one of the companies joining the agreement declares its withdrawal, then other companies will not be liable for the obligations of the agreement. All disputes will be resolved by arbitration.</p>
<h3>Oil Mines Discovered in Northeastern Germany</h3>
<p>National Press, Berlin, 2nd - Red Yue News claims that a large number of oil mines have been discovered in northeastern Germany. After reporting by famous geologists and secretly investigating on a large scale by the American Nivek Company, it has acquired a large number of lands and will soon drill oil wells. The expenses are subsidized by the American kerosene king Du Ertai. This move will help Germany pay reparations, etc. However, the industrial sector said that this news is inevitably exaggerated, because oil production there has been known for a long time. I don’t know how many times the trial has been carried out, and the oil quality is poor, and it often fails. The German authorities also suspect that this move may be that the company wants to promote stocks or set up a scam, so it is exaggerated. However, Fu Xiguang reported that Americans have indeed acquired a large number of lands and seem to be very active there. At present, Hasselmann, a former Mobil kerosene expert, is traveling there.</p>
<h3>Indian Footwear Industry Bans Purchase of Foreign Cloth</h3>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 2nd - The Bombay Dyeing and Printing Cloth Association passed a resolution today, stating that members, in view of the current domestic political situation, agreed not to order or sell any foreign cloth within three months. This case is effective immediately, and if anyone violates this case, the Standing Committee has the right to take measures to deal with it.</p>
<h3>American House of Representatives Considers Tariff Bill</h3>
<p>National Press, Washington, 2nd - The House of Representatives considered the tariff bill for three hours, and all the resolutions have been sent to the Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Representatives for review, so as to eliminate the differences between the two houses on the attitude towards this case. However, senators and representatives from the eastern agricultural states are still vigorously criticizing this case, saying that the new tariff bill will increase the tax rates on many daily necessities, not only failing to alleviate the suffering of farmers, but also increasing the burden of farmers. Therefore, when this case is voted on in the future, the representatives of the eastern states will still make a final struggle.</p>
<h3>Dragging Aircraft Flying Attracts Audience</h3>

<h3>Central Propaganda Department Receives the Press</h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department received newspaper reporters at the Second Conference Hall of the Central Committee at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd. More than 20 people attended. Liu Luyin chaired the meeting and reported that the current situation in the north this week is even more dangerous than last week. The various social, economic, military, and political conditions in the north that have been seen in recent days are briefly reported as follows: (1) In terms of society, since Yan forcibly occupied the Beijing organs by force, he has recently used autocratic and dictatorial methods to monitor various speech organs, implement censorship of mail and telegrams, and cut off traffic between Beijing, Shanxi, and other places. In Beijing newspapers, in addition to the Yan organ newspaper promoting Yan, the rest were closed down, even foreign-run newspapers were the same. At the same time, Yan sent secret agents to spread all over the Pingjin area, and most of the people traveling in Pingjin were secretly monitored, especially foreigners. In the current situation, the local people have no right to freedom of speech and residence. (2) In terms of economy, Yan has recently absorbed cash in many ways, promoted paper currency, and forced people to use it. On the one hand, he has used a scavenging policy, doing his best to scavenge on the Ping-Sui and Han routes. According to the latest reports, the Ping-Han route can receive more than 30 million yuan per year. Since Yan has scavenged it, the annual income is no more than 10 million yuan. The Ping-Sui route can receive 9 million to 10 million yuan per year, and now the income is less than 3 million yuan. Yan has also prepaid grain taxes, which have now been levied until the 22nd year of the Republic of China. It is expected that there will be a major crisis in two or three months after this self-defeating policy.

<h3>He Jian's Talk on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence, Propaganda Department of the Hunan Provincial 指委會 (Committee) yesterday (30th, i.e., the 30th of the month)</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM, the Hunan Provincial 指委會 invited Commander-in-Chief He, and at the Youth Association, held a reception for the press to explain the current situation. Over thirty people attended. First, Propaganda Minister Tan Changkai reported the meaning of the reception, briefly stating that he was very pleased that everyone braved the rain to attend today. There were several important matters that he wanted to report to everyone. Recently, the voices of cooperation between Wang and Chiang were very loud for a time. It should be known that Generalissimo Chiang's actions are based on the Party's position and are directed by the Party's orders. Wang Jingwei has already been expelled from the Party and should not be reused. Cooperation between Wang and Chiang is truly impossible. Furthermore, Feng and Yan are the chief culprits in betraying the Party and the country. As evidenced by the facts, the collusion between Feng and Yan cannot last. The most important conflict of interest is the issue of Haikou. Whoever controls Haikou can control the other's fate. Feng intends to seize Tianjin, while Yan is doing his utmost to stop him. The original division of territory between Feng and Yan stipulated that Feng would dispatch troops to the Pinghan Railway and Xiangyang, but recently Yan suddenly changed his policy, assigning the Pinghan Railway to the Jin army for combat, and Feng did not leave Xiangyang, instead, he crossed the Longhai Railway and advanced towards Shandong. This is all a sham and has already fundamentally broken down. Furthermore, instigation and rumour-mongering are common tactics of politicians and frustrated military men, and also a sharp weapon for counter-revolutionaries to attack our Party. I hope that comrades in the press will strive to correct this, and so on. Next, He Jian reported, "I have long wanted to talk to everyone. Taking this opportunity today, I will talk about the situation in Hunan. Hunan has always been Hunan of the Central Government, no matter what.</p>
<p>Hunan is founded on the National Revolution; therefore, all provincial government measures are based on the National Revolution as the guiding principle. Furthermore, Hunan is also Hunan under the rule of the Kuomintang; therefore, the entire Hunan army is founded on supporting the Central Government as the guiding principle and maintaining law and order as its duty. The current situation has changed, and in addition to the fact that most of the Hunan army has been ordered to open to Guangxi, as has been recorded in detail in various newspapers, there is one important key point that should be reported to everyone. Generalissimo Chiang ordered the Fourth Route Army to concentrate in Guilin on the 9th of last month. On the 7th of last month, the Hunan army had already arrived at the Darongjiang River, only one and a half days away from Guilin. The reason why they did not enter Guilin was that combat is a collaborative effort. The Sixth Route Army, the left of the Fourth Route Army, and further left the Eighth Route Army. When the Fourth Route Army advanced, the Sixth Route Army was hampered by the local militia and moved away, resulting in a void on the left flank and presenting a state of isolated advance. This would not only be ineffective militarily but also harmful. Therefore, for the sake of caution, it was necessary to pause slightly. Later, after consultation with the Commander of the Sixth Route Army, the plan was changed, and it was decided that the Sixth Route Army would enter Pingle, and the Fourth Route Army would immediately enter Guilin to achieve the effect of collaborative work. According to the revised plan, they should have arrived in Guilin today. However, the reason why they have not yet entered is that the Sixth Route Army has another mission, which has led to a change in the plan. Someone</p>
<p>says that the Hunan army is useless, or that the Hunan army does not obey the orders of the Central Government. These are statements that do not understand the facts. The Hunan army wanted to enter Guilin and could have taken it immediately, but it would not have been effective militarily; therefore, it was not implemented. Turning to the situation of bandit suppression in this province, the bandit forces in the neighbouring provinces of Jiangxi and Hubei are vast. Taking advantage of the many affairs in Guangxi and the Yangtze River army having no time to take care of it, the Communist Party is carrying out large-scale activities in Tongcheng in western Hubei and Nanhua'an in this province, setting up a Soviet government. Fortunately, they have all been cracked down on one after another. Ye Kui, the leader in charge of the Communist Party's work in Nanhua'an, has already been captured and killed. The Communist Party's plan has been thwarted. The bandit situation in Jiangxi is very serious, and it is not easy to transfer troops. Fortunately, the Qi-Zhu road is open, and troops have been rushed from Youxian to garrison Pingxiang, so Pingliu can be said to be safe. Now, the people</p>
<p>talk about bandits with great fear, which is not surprising. However, I can take full responsibility for the security of the entire province of Hunan. However, to fundamentally eliminate them, it will not be possible without joint suppression with Chairman Lu of Jiangxi and Chairman He of Hubei. Furthermore, Hunan is facing difficult circumstances and cannot be said to be completely well, but it is doing its best to move in a good direction. As long as security can be maintained, there is a good harvest year, and financial resources are abundant, there will be a solution. Currently, the Changsha-Changde and other highways will soon be open to traffic. In the future, the income of the Highway Bureau will be abundant, and there will be funds. The provincial government's subsidy of 400,000 yuan can be transferred to other urgent needs. The prospect of construction can be viewed optimistically, and so on. The reception concluded with refreshments at 12:00 noon. (The 1st)</p>
<h3>Sudden Changes in the Department of Chen Hanzhang in Hunan</h3>
<p>Chen Hanzhang was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt</p>
<p>Li Guojun freely occupied Hongjiang</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence, Chen Hanzhang, the commander of the Second Garrison of Hunan, has been stationed in Hongjiang, western Hunan, for eleven years. His troops, including the three regiments of Chen Woxiong, Pin Jun, and Li Guojun, although not formal army, are still able to clear bandits and secure the people. Recently, Commander-in-Chief He telegraphed the Central Government for approval to reorganize Chen's troops into the Independent Eighth Brigade, with Chen Hanzhang still serving as the brigade commander. Chen was very happy that his troops were included in the ranks of the National Army. Unexpectedly, a change occurred within his own camp, and he was assassinated in his garrison. Fortunately, he was not killed, but his troops suddenly rebelled and forced an attack on Hongjiang. Chen had no choice but to flee, and his life is in extreme danger. It started on the 23rd of last month at 5:00 PM, Chen went to the Xinhuangxiang Guildhall in Hongshi New Street for a banquet hosted by local merchants. It was not until 11:30 PM that he left, having enjoyed himself, and led six bodyguards, riding in a three-man sedan chair, on his way home. As he turned to Yangjia Alley in Heyue Street, seven men dressed in clothing similar to that of the bodyguards suddenly rushed out, holding Mauser pistols and firing at Chen's sedan chair. Chen's bodyguards were caught off guard. Three ran away, while the remaining three urged the sedan chair carriers to flee quickly. Unexpectedly, the assassins continued to chase and fire. In an instant, one of the sedan chair carriers was shot down to the ground. Chen was also knocked out of the sedan chair, and a bullet grazed Chen's abdomen. Two bodyguards supported Chen and fled, while another bodyguard returned fire with a fully loaded Hua machine gun, and only then were the assassins repelled. They helped Chen into the sedan chair and hurried back to his private residence, and immediately telegraphed the headquarters to pursue the assassins. Unexpectedly, the telephone had been destroyed and was out of order. He had to send a bodyguard to report. When Chief of Staff Wu Sigong and Adjutant Zhou Meizhong received the report and sent soldiers to arrest them, the assassins had long since fled. That night, they sent people to summon Dr. Hyde of the Ailian Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, although there was no danger to his life, he had to rest for one or two weeks to fully recover. The affairs of the headquarters were temporarily handled by Wu Sigong. On the one hand, a reward of 1,000 yuan was offered for the capture of the assassins, and a curfew was ordered to prevent accidents. Suddenly, it was reported that Li Guojun, the commander of the Third Regiment stationed in Zhijiang, led his troops to Hongjiang on the 25th, and had clashed with the Third Battalion (Chen Woxiong) of the First Regiment stationed in Qianyang. All sectors of Hongjiang were terrified upon hearing the news. Wu Sigong, considering that the garrison in Qianyang was weak, also sent the Special Service Battalion and the Engineering and Artillery Companies of the headquarters to reinforce it. The two sides fought fiercely five or six times, lasting three days. Only because the Hongjiang army was demoralized and leaderless due to Chen's assassination, more than a hundred people had died. The officers and soldiers of Li's regiment bravely charged and could not resist the attack. On the evening of the 27th, they retreated to Hongjiang. They then complied with the request of the Hongjiang Chamber of Commerce and escorted Chen Hanzhang, whose wound had not yet healed, to Anjiang, sixty miles away from Hongjiang. In addition to urgently dispatching troops from the garrison in Xupu and Wugang to concentrate in Anjiang in order to punish Li, they also telegraphed the province to request troops to assist in the suppression. He Jian then telegraphed Chen Quzhen, commander of the First Garrison, to send troops nearby to assist in the handling. Li Guojun suddenly telegraphed the province on the evening of the 30th, reporting that on the 28th, he had complied with the request of the Hongjiang merchants to garrison Hongshi, maintain order, and investigate the assassins, and attacked Chen Woxiong for plotting a rebellion, asking the province to instruct on how to deal with the aftermath. After receiving the telegram, He Jian, considering that Li's regiment had telegraphed to express obedience to orders, and the disposal must be cautious, immediately telegraphed Li Guojun to be responsible for maintaining order and not to act without authorization, and to wait for the dispatch of personnel to investigate the truth in order to deal with it. On the one hand, he has sent Xiang Chengzhu to Hongjiang to thoroughly investigate the truth in order to deal with it. On the other hand, he telegraphed Wu Sigong to investigate and report on Chen Hanzhang's injury situation, and not to act rashly, waiting for disposal. According to a certain important person, the province had received reports of Li's regiment's conspiracy to rebel early on, and had telegraphed Chen Hanzhang to take precautions, but unexpectedly it became a reality. The province has now properly formulated a solution and is currently making arrangements, it is said. Attached is Li's regiment's telegram in its entirety: "Chairman of Changsha"</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief He Junjian, on this auspicious day of this month, received a secret telegram from Chen Guangzong, Yang Guanglu, Wu Kecheng, Chen Xiaoshan, and other representatives of the Hongjiang public groups, saying, "Commander Li of Yuanzhou, Xun Jian, the order of Hongfu has always relied on the maintenance of Commander Chen and your brother, and all sectors have praised it. However, the situation is changing and external waves are rising. Last night, after the second watch, Commander Chen was passing through Yangjia Alley on Xinshi Street in the port, and happened to encounter many thugs who rushed out from the middle and opened fire. For a time, there was no time to defend, and he was seriously injured, and several bodyguards were killed. The whole city was shocked and extremely terrified. The merchants and people of this port, upon hearing this news, convened an emergency meeting and agreed that Hongfu had suffered a sudden change, and we were afraid that unscrupulous people would disturb the public order. Your brother has been stationed in Hongjiang many times, and all sectors have a lot of feelings, and the people and the place are especially suitable. Now, we will welcome you with a flying telegram, and we earnestly hope that you will follow the public opinion and give us relief, then our more than 100,000 people will be grateful again. The telegram is full of joy and hope," and so on. Guojun was caught off guard when he received the warning telegram and was filled with grief. On this auspicious day, he immediately transferred his troops and rushed to Hongjiang overnight. On the one hand, he suppressed the local area and on the other hand, he investigated the assassins and passed through Qianyang. Suddenly, the Third Battalion of the First Regiment of the headquarters came out and opened fire, and they did not understand. Before this case occurred, it was said that Regiment Commander Chen Woxiong had accumulated a conspiracy for the position of commander and had long wanted to take it. This time, Guojun sent troops to punish the murderers, which was justified, but the troops of Chen's regiment in Qianyang stopped it, which was enough to prove Chen Woxiong's ambition. After several days of conflict, Guojun's troops finally arrived in Hongjiang on the day of the survey. I maintain order in my original capacity and separately telegrammed the garrisons to order the troops to remain in their original defenses and be responsible for protection. As for the aftermath, I will wait for the order to resolve it. The telegram is panic-stricken and cannot be rushed. Li Guojun, Commander of the Third Regiment of the Second Garrison Command of Hunan Province, bowed his head." (April 1st)</p>
<h3>The Situation in Fujian After Liu's Division Arrived in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>Liu Chen Negotiated the Issues Between the Provincial Government and Provincial Defense Fuzhou Correspondence, Liu Heding's division, Gui Zhenyuan and Liu Shangzhi's two brigades, advanced from Quanzhou and Xinghua and were stationed in the provincial capital. As of the 27th, they had all arrived, including two infantry brigades, one artillery regiment, one special service battalion, one engineering battalion, one transportation company, and one training company, with a total of about 12,000 people. The division headquarters was located at the old site of the military hall in Dongmen, Liu Shangzhi's brigade headquarters was located at the Donghu barracks, Gui Zhenyuan's brigade headquarters was located at the Chenghuang Temple in Beimen, and the artillery regiment headquarters was located at the Huodi Temple in Beimen. The division sent teams to patrol the vicinity of the division and brigade headquarters, and the sentries were especially strict at night. The bandits of He En, Sheng Zhang, Ben, and Shou, took advantage of the troop transfer and rampaged. They advanced from Guanyuan District, the border between the northwest, to Dafu Ridge in Ma'an Township, one mile outside Beimen. They burned, robbed, and killed, and the villagers fled into the city to seek help from the division headquarters. Liu's division dispatched a battalion of Gui Zhenyuan's brigade out of the city to suppress the bandits on the 27th. The bandits retreated to Chiqiao and Xindian, about five miles away. The battalion is currently pursuing them. Therefore, the people have a good impression of the division. Regarding the provincial situation, it is said that Liu Heding hosted a banquet for Chen Jiliang, Lin Zhong, Sa Fuchou, Yu Bailiang, Wu Xuan, Chen Peikun, Jiang Pingfan, and others at the division headquarters on the evening of the 27th. During the banquet, there was much discussion about the reorganization of the provincial government. It was proposed that Liu's division, Lu's division, and the navy each recommend two people, and the central government designate four people as the provincial committee. Yang Shuzhuang would still be the chairman. Chen Jiliang and Liu Heding would telegraph Chen Shaokuan and Zhang Qun separately to ask Chairman Chiang for instructions. As for Chen Naiyuan and other six people, they would be sent to Beijing for handling after the new provincial committee was announced. Regarding the issue of provincial defense, Chen Jiliang and Liu Heding have completed negotiations. Chen Jiliang, in the name of the commander of the marine corps stationed in Fujian, will transfer all of Lin Zhong's brigade to Fuding Prefecture to suppress bandits (according to Lin Jin),</p>
<p>Zhenzhong's regiment was originally in Fuding, and now only Huang Maohe's regiment is stationed in the provincial capital. The provincial defense will be fully responsible by Liu's division. Division Commander Liu also plans to station Liu Shangzhi's brigade in the provincial capital, and Liu will be appointed as the commander of the provincial defense. Gui Zhenyuan's brigade will be stationed in Gutian, Minqing, and Yongtai near the province, and Chen Wantai's brigade will be transferred from Quanzhou to Putian, Xianyou, and Fuqing, so that they can be linked to the provincial capital. The counties of Jinjiang, Nan'an, Hui'an, Yongchun, and Anxi in Quanzhou will still be garrisoned by Lin Shouguo's brigade. (March 29th)</p>

<p>Important News 2</p>
<h3>Peng Qibiao Reports on the Suppression of Communists</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence, Peng Qibiao, commander of the Independent 14th Brigade, recently submitted a report to the Provisional Headquarters on the actual situation of the Communist Party in Honghu and the situation of his troops' search and suppression of bandits and Communists in great detail. He Chengjun, the acting chief, ordered Peng Qibiao to cooperate with Li Yunlong's troops and the Hunan army Wang Dongyuan's brigade and Chen's regiment to thoroughly suppress the bandits and also ordered the Gongsheng warship to provide assistance so that they could be wiped out as scheduled. The original report of Peng Qibiao is excerpted as follows: (1) I previously received a report from Regiment Commander He Xuchu that thousands of Communist bandits had invaded Chi Shi Shishou, and I sent Deputy Brigade Commander Liu Yi to lead troops to supervise the suppression, which has been reported by telegram. Now, Deputy Brigade Commander Liu reported as follows: (1) I arrived in Sha on the evening of the 22nd. The troops of the Third Battalion were delayed until the 23rd due to too many tugboats and strong winds. According to reports from all parties, this group of Communist bandits is known as the Sixth Red Army, and its commander is Sun Deqing. The army is divided into three vertical columns: the first, second, and third. The vertical columns are divided into four detachments, and the detachments are divided into four platoons. The teams are all cadres trained by the military academy established in Honghu, and they have quite a bit of Communist discipline. They can attack and resist. Their internal organization is also quite strict. There is a political committee, and its chairman is Yun Daiying, who is a famous person in the Communist Party. There is an economic committee, and there are front-line hospitals and rear-line wards. They eat civilian food and give each person 500 wen. Except for official or public looting, the petty private looting is strictly prohibited. In this situation, this group of Communist bandits should not be ignored. (2) This time, the Communist Red Army that attacked Shishou and Ouchi was led by pseudo-army commander Sun Deqing and pseudo-political commissar Yun Daiying, with the Sixth Army's first and second vertical columns, about 4,000 to 5,000 people, about 2,000 guns, and about 40 mobile machine guns. On the evening of the 16th of this month, they crossed the river from Majiazhai, Xinchang, and Xinkou and other places. At dawn on the 17th, they simultaneously besieged Shishou and Ouchi, causing the troops in the two places to be unable to support each other. Moreover, there was a large river in between, making it even more difficult to coordinate. In the Battle of Shishou, the fierce fighting lasted for two nights, and the casualties on both sides were no less than 200 people. In the Battle of Ouchi, the casualties were no less than 100 people. (3) After the bandits occupied Shishou and Ouchi, they sent the captured hostages to Chaimatou on the north bank of the lower reaches of Shishou that night, and then sent the spoils and wounded bandits in batches to that place. (4) The base of this group of Communist bandits is Honghu at the junction of Jian and Mian, and they haunt the counties of Jing, Qian, Jian, Shi, and Jiangling. Recently, the important Communist Party organs have been set up in Guanyinsi, Majiazhai, Xinchang, Xinkou, Chaimatou, Sanfujie, Tuomaobu, and other places along the river. (5) The Communist Party's plan is to attack Ouchi first, then Shishou. After Shishou is captured, they will attack Shashi. After Shashi is occupied, they will go straight to Wuhan. Their strategy focuses on seducing farmers and workers, anesthetizing young people, and attracting ignorant soldiers. They kill, set fires, kidnap people for ransom, and seize local militia weapons to fill their military ranks. Their method of offense is to use ignorant farmers and workers to hold knives and spears and swarm forward, and the second line is their real party members with guns. Their scouts mostly use 15- or 16-year-old young women and so on. (6) The troops of He's regiment originally stationed in Ouchi, Shishou, and other places retreated to the border of Huarong due to being outnumbered and not being able to receive support, and contacted the Xiang army stationed in Huarong Xu camp to jointly suppress the Communist bandits in Laijiadian, but they were still unable to resist and the Xiang army also suffered losses. (7) Now, He's regiment has restored the tune, and the bandits are scurrying to Songjiapu, Hejialing, Luzipu, and other places. In addition to ordering He's regiment to station one company in Ouchi and two companies in Shishou, the remaining troops are concentrated in Diao Xian, and I am also leading the Third Battalion to Diao to command the suppression, striving to eliminate the roots. Wherever the bandits flee, I will pursue and suppress them until they are annihilated. If the bandits flee to the north of the Yangtze River, I will immediately lead the team to suppress the bandits' dens north of the Yangtze River. (2) In addition to ordering Deputy Brigade Commander Liu to strictly supervise the search and suppression to eliminate the roots, I should report the details to you for your review.

<h3>Communist Party Detected in the Harbin Special District</h3>
<p>Kaiming Bookstore in Harbin Sells Propaganda and Communist Printed Matter</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence, In the past month, labour strikes have occurred repeatedly in Harbin, although they were resolved quickly and did not expand. After a secret investigation, it was learned that these labour strikes were manipulated by someone. For example, the recent oil mill strike was planned by the Communist Party. In addition, communist leaflets, declarations, books, and other printed matter have been discovered in the city. Bao Wenwei, the chief of the police department, feared that a major riot would break out, so he secretly ordered Sun Peichen, the advisor to the police department, and Sun Shifu, the head of the First District of the Special District, to pay attention to the investigation. On the 27th, Sun and others learned that the Harbin Bookstore on 14th Chinese Street in Daoli was selling prohibited printed matter, so they led the police to search the bookstore at 6:00 AM on the 28th. They seized many copies of the "Red Monthly Magazine" and brought the female person in charge, Jiang Leying, and the shop assistant, Xia Hongxun, to the office. Jiang confessed to the office that she was a teacher at No. 16 Elementary School. The books were consigned for sale by a student from a certain school. She had not read the contents, so she did not know that they were communist propaganda. Xia Hongxun said that when a student from a certain school entrusted the sale of the books, he said that they were published by the Kaiming Bookstore. After obtaining the clues, Sun and others went to the Kaiming Bookstore on Qiancheng Street at 9:00 AM and searched it. They found various books and more than 20 wooden stamps in the printing factory that claimed to promote communism, as well as more than 1,000 copies of red propaganda books such as the "Half-Monthly Magazine," "The Masses Monthly Magazine," "The Past of Russian Farmers," and "Demands of the Delegation of Workers of the East China Railway." They arrested Zhang Haihuan, the person in charge, and Shang Zhimin, the chief proofreader, as well as Wang Lifeng, the president of Harbin College, who lived in the bureau, and sent them to the Special Police Office in the afternoon for interrogation. After interrogation, Wang Lifeng was released on bail pending trial due to insufficient evidence of his crime. The rest were detained, and the case will be investigated further before being interrogated together. The two Kaiming bookstores in Harbin were immediately sealed up. When Wang Lifeng was detained, more than 100 students from Harbin College went to the police station to request Wang's release. The authorities sent Inspector Wu to meet with them and told them that if the investigation showed no suspicion, he would be released. The students then withdrew. (March 28th)</p>
<h3>A Large Gang of Bandit Boats Discovered in Yangcheng Lake</h3>
<p>The traces of the bandits are erratic, and the military police went to suppress them but failed. Suzhou Correspondence, Thirty-seven bandit boats in Yangcheng Lake were discovered at dawn one day in Xietang, Suzhou Township. Li Weizu, the head of the 13th District, immediately telegraphed the Wuxian County government, ordering the third platoon of the third squadron of the county police stationed in Chefang to suppress them. On one side, he requested the Taihu Bandit Suppression Command to send Zhang Ting, the second battalion commander of the 25th Regiment, to lead the entire battalion of soldiers to arrive at Xietang at 6:00 PM that afternoon by hiring a steamer and towing five large civilian boats. The third platoon of the third squadron of the county police, more than 60 people, was led by Squadron Commander Cai Yu and set off from Chefang, arriving at Xietang by land and water routes at the same time. On the morning of the 2nd, they went to Xihualian, left Dushu Lake, and went north to Jinji Lake, searching along the way and returning to Xietang without encountering any trace of the bandits. Later, it was learned that a large gang of bandit boats was indeed in Xihualian at that time. Then, at noon one day, they divided a portion of the bandit boats, seven in total, and headed to Nanta Shuiqiao of Huangshiqiao, Jinji Lake. At about 4:00 PM, the seven bandit boats hurriedly returned to Xihualian, blowing their sirens horizontally, and left Dushu Lake with a large group of boats. Their appearance was very panicked when they left. At about 6:00 PM in the afternoon, bandit boats were discovered again at Qiongjigeng on the Jinji Lake side, two miles west of Xietang. They went out of Xiagiacun via Tangpu to Shahu in the Wusong River. The next day (the 2nd), the military police who arrived at Xietang went to Shahu to pursue and suppress them but did not encounter them. The bandit boats passed Qiongjigeng at 6:00 PM one afternoon, and then exited Shahu at about 7:00 PM, entering Xiaoweiting Port and arriving at Shijia Port. Wang Baoshen, the district chief of Weiting, immediately telegraphed the county to report. At dawn on the 2nd, the bandit boats returned from Shijia Port to Yangcheng Village. At 5:00 PM, the bandit boats still left Xiaoweiting Port via the original route to Shahu, and at night, they went from the south of Shahu to Fengli Village. Today (the 3rd) morning, the second battalion of the 25th Regiment stationed in Xietang received an order from the headquarters that there were bandits in Zhucun, Yangcheng Lake County. The battalion sent Xie Yong'an, the fifth company commander, to lead the entire company of soldiers to walk along the land road via Waikuatang. The third platoon of the third squadron of the county police was ordered to transfer to Wei at 11:00 PM last night, and at 4:00 AM this morning, they passed Waikuatang and advanced eastward along the railroad to Tangwang Temple on the south side of Ocean Bridge No. 85. They searched and found no bandits. At dawn, they arrived at Weiting. In the afternoon, the army and aquatic public security team of 12 squads who fought with the bandits in Kunshan also chased to Weiting from Zhengyi. Also, when Shanzhuang opened fire last night, Weiting Town heard cannon fire. It only subsided after midnight. Zhou Zhaolin, the district chief of Xiangcheng, also sent an urgent telegram to the county government today, reporting that the town heard frequent gunfire and artillery fire in the afternoon. The people were panicked and abnormal. Now, the 11th Aquatic Public Security Team and the guerrillas have arrived in Xiangcheng to suppress them. Another correspondence, In various villages in Sucheng, bandits have been rampant recently, and kidnapping and robbery incidents have occurred several times a day. At about 11:00 PM one night, a gang of more than 100 bandits arrived in Xitai Township, four miles outside of Fengmen, intending to sneak into the city by boat. The county and city public security bureaus sent teams to chase and suppress them, but they fled to Yangcheng Lake. The city defense was especially strengthened that night. At about 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, the gang of bandits fled to various villages between Weiting and Zhengyi to cause trouble. After receiving the report that night, the Wuxian County government immediately ordered the aquatic and land police teams and requested the Aquatic Public Security Bureau of the Third District to send guerrillas to encircle and suppress them. At about 8:00 PM, the police and bandits opened fire at Shanzhuang and the two sides confronted each other for two hours. The bandits were unable to support themselves and collapsed and retreated to Yangcheng Lake. Zou, the director of the Suzhou City Public Security Bureau, was afraid that stray bandits would flee to Suzhou and affect public security, so he issued an order to all districts to be strictly vigilant. The county government received a request from Wang Baoshen, the district chief of Weiting, today to send troops to suppress them, and has ordered the police team to send troops to garrison the town to secure the area.</p>
<h3>Further News on the Robbery at Zhangyan Town, Jinshan</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Songjiang reports that since the robbery in Zhangyan Town, Jinshan, last winter by a gang of bandits, a security force of twenty men has been recruited to supplement the police. They have purchased handheld machine guns and Mauser pistols, making them relatively well-equipped. This force is under the command of a Public Security Bureau branch, and they train diligently on a daily basis. One afternoon, over forty bandit boats passed through Songyin in a menacing manner. Songyin immediately telegraphed Zhangyan to be on alert. Consequently, the security force was deployed to defend at the Renzi Temple Bay north of the town. Soon, the bandit boats arrived. The branch bureau chief ordered the security force and police to prepare, and commanded the bandit boats to halt. The bandits immediately swarmed ashore, opening fire. The security force and police fought back vigorously, but were eventually surrounded due to being outnumbered. Two men were killed in action and their weapons were seized by the bandits. However, the bandits also suffered many casualties, and the corpses were taken away by the bandits. The remaining bandits charged into the town in a blitz, first raiding the Public Security Bureau for weapons, and then dispersing to loot. Over forty businesses of significant scale, including the Yitai Pawnshop, Xiehe Pawnshop, Hengda Bank, the Post Office, Wanhe Jewelry Store, Hengchang, and Hengtai Foreign Goods and Silk Store, were looted, as well as over ten households including the Yao and Zhu families. Besides Li Xing of the Xiehe Pawnshop, Gu Jiasheng, Wang Jingbo, and three other staff members from the Yitai Pawnshop, thirty male and female students from the Liuxi School were kidnapped, along with one headmaster and four teachers. It was reported that during the robbery, gunshots were heard from the school, leading the bandits to believe there were weapons inside, hence the raid and kidnappings. In addition, the entire Zhu family of six, and one son and one daughter from the Jisheng Pharmacy, totaling over eighty people, were abducted. They finished looting by eleven o'clock and boarded the boats, forcing the Shanghai-Zhangyan ferry to tow them to the Guanwang Temple, where the bandit leaders interrogated the hostages to determine who would be kept or released. Over thirty people, including Li Xinglin, were ordered to transfer to the bandit boats to be held, while those to be released were ordered to board the ferry, which was then allowed to return. After the incident, the Jinshan County Government sent a committee the next day to investigate, but no arrangements for the aftermath have been discussed yet. It is said that many shops have not reopened. Furthermore, Hejingwan, a village about a mile from the town, was also robbed on the night of the second day. The Zhu rice shop and Wu Shouping chaff shop suffered significant losses. It was truly a massive robbery. Local correspondent.</p>

<p>Recent News on the Guanshao-Maojing River Project: The Guanshao and Maojing rivers in the southeast of the county seat have not been dredged for many years, leading to severe siltation, which significantly impacts water conservation and farmland. Farmers along the river believe further delay is unacceptable. After Chen Xieqing and other district residents petitioned the county government, an order was issued to the first and second district offices to jointly handle the matter. After receiving the order, the district invited local figures to discuss solutions and decided to organize a dredging bureau, following past practices, using land deeds and tenant labor. The district chiefs of Zhong and Fei were appointed as directors in charge, with Xu Chunbo, the town chief, directing the Maojing River project and Zhang Qingquan directing the Guanshao River project. Work began last month. The Guanshao River is approximately over a thousand zhang long, with over five hundred zhang within the first district. The Maojing River is also over a thousand zhang long, with seven hundred zhang within the first district. The depth is set at five chi, the river surface at five zhang, and the riverbed at three zhang. Under the diligent supervision of the Jing Duan Directors, the work is being carried out earnestly. County Magistrate Jin, accompanied by District Chief Zhong, inspected the work site the other day. Over half of the Maojing River project within the first district is completed, and the second district has also started work. The Guanshao River project within the first district is nearing completion, and County Magistrate Jin personally ordered District Chief Fei to expedite progress within the second district, so that the entire line can be completed to benefit the people.</p>

Without asking questions, they surrounded and beat Dai and his companions. A group of villagers also rushed into the school and tore down the portrait of Chief Examiner that was hanging on the wall. The village chief arrived upon hearing the news and stopped the attack, and the villagers dispersed. However, Dai had already been injured and was helped back to Huangdu for medical treatment.

They were planning to flee to the Taihu Lake area to loot. Therefore, the regiment dispatched a mortar company and an infantry company to Guajing Port, a key route out of Taihu Lake, to be stationed overnight, hoping to annihilate them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>County Public Security Bureau Accused of Thorough Investigation: Su Yong of the County Public Security Bureau went to Lili to arrest gamblers this year.

The Department of Civil Affairs ordered the county government to conduct a thorough investigation. Upon receiving the telegram, the county government immediately ordered Ling Yingzhen, a resident of the Fourth District, to investigate and report back.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Telegram Requesting the Purchase and Transport of Foreign Rice to Relieve the People's Food Supply: Recently, rice prices in Suzhou have soared, making it difficult for common people to obtain food.

<p>Lake Bandits Gather in Xiyang Village: After the suppression of the lake bandits entrenched in Yangsantai Temple by the 28th Regiment of the 5th Division stationed in Kunshan and the county police force on the morning of the 31st of last month, the Yangsantai Temple was burned down, and the bandits fled without a trace. The anti-bandit forces then withdrew. However, it was reported on the evening of the 1st from Dongtang Market that the lake bandits had regrouped in the area of Xiyang Village, about three li from Yangsantai Temple.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Resolution to Maintain the Civilian Vocational Training Center: The Wuxi Civilian Vocational Training Center has been in operation for over a year, housing beggars and women, currently totaling over 280 people. Food, especially rice, constitutes the largest portion of regular expenses, averaging about 2,000 yuan per month. Due to financial difficulties, there was a resolution to reorganize it into a relief center. However, the relief center was deemed impossible to establish in practice due to economic constraints. The center's original funds are almost depleted, and the donations from shop owners amount to only over 400 yuan per month, far short of the current expenses. The center's board of directors held a meeting at the County Chamber of Commerce yesterday to discuss ways to maintain the center. The following resolutions were reached: (1) Organize a fundraising board of directors to be responsible for raising funds for the center, appointing Jiang Huanqing, Cheng Jingtang, and five others as fundraising directors. (2) The center's regular income consists only of shop owner donations and dry cocoon surcharges, amounting to just over 700 yuan per month, leaving a shortfall of over 1,000 yuan compared to current expenses. It was decided to request the county government to allocate 1,000 yuan from the local funds, with the remaining shortfall to be raised by the fundraising directors. (3) Establish an office at the County Chamber of Commerce for the board of directors to facilitate their work. (4) Before the county funds are allocated, the board of directors will advance 1,000 yuan this month to maintain operations.</p>
<p>Framing an Innocent Citizen Out of Personal Grudge: Fei Zhongliang, the deputy township head of Xishui Township in Kaiyuan County, was recently instigated by Qin Xifang, a local ruffian, to falsely accuse Gao Zhongyu, a fellow villager, of engaging in reactionary activities. He volunteered to lead the arrest to the 9th sub-bureau of the Public Security, and sub-bureau Chief Lu Zhiguang reported it and immediately led the police to investigate and arrest. During the process, Fei seized the opportunity to plant a wallet (containing bullets and Gao Zhongyu's name card with reactionary titles) on Gao's table. Sub-bureau Chief Lu then took Gao Zhongyu to the bureau, and reported the incident to Fei Zhongliang, and transferred Gao Zhongyu, along with Fei Zhongliang who had made the report, to the County Government for interrogation. At 3:30 PM yesterday, interrogator Yu presided over the trial. Fei Zhongliang confessed to being instigated by Qin Xifang and falsely accusing Gao Zhongyu. Gao Zhongyu, when interrogated, stated that Qin Xifang had previously been imprisoned for his many misdeeds in the village, and that Qin held a grudge against him, which led to the incitement and false accusation. He requested that the law be strictly enforced. Interrogator Yu approved Gao Zhongyu's release and ordered Fei Zhongliang to be detained, pending the summoning of relevant witnesses for interrogation.</p>
<p>Bandits Kidnap for Ransom at Night: Qian Fenghao, the manager of the Dingchang Silk Factory outside the south gate of this county, lives in Nancun, Xinan Township. Recently, he initiated a fundraising campaign to dredge the Nanchangbang River, which had not been dredged for some time, causing the riverbed to become muddy. The dredging was completed, and Qian distributed wages in the village the other day. Unexpectedly, at around 11 PM, four or five bandits disguised as laborers, wearing short clothes and armed with fake pistols (made with umbrella handles) and iron rulers, broke into Qian's house by digging a hole in the wall. They looted the house, taking 40 yuan in cash, two gold button heads, two gold rings, two pieces of clothing, and a briefcase, totaling 70-80 yuan in value. After looting, the bandits kidnapped Qian Fenghao's two-year-old daughter, Zhou Ba (also known as Ba Mei), and left, claiming that they would return for ransom. Qian immediately reported the incident to the Second District of the Water Police of the Provincial Public Security Department stationed in Wuxi, requesting an investigation. Yesterday, Chen Rongquan, the captain of the Sixth Squad of the district, arrested ten suspects, including Wang Wenzhang, Liu Mingfu, Wang Huibi, and Zhang Dayin. They were immediately escorted to the district office for interrogation.</p>
<p>Negotiations Regarding the Sale of Inferior Silkworm Eggs: Zhang Ziguang, the owner of the Yonghe Cloth and Cocoon Shop near the south gate of Wuxi, not only runs the cloth and cocoon business but also sells inferior silkworm eggs. Numerous villagers have suffered as a result. Recently, Zhang Ziguang baked chrysanthemum silkworm eggs and labeled them as spring silkworm eggs, falsely advertising them under brands such as Gan Jin Shengmin Ruyi Shuangjin, and entrusted Ni Yingsheng to sell them to villagers. However, these inferior eggs could not hatch, and the villagers realized they had been deceived and became extremely angry. On the evening of the other day, they gathered a large number of buyers, bringing the inferior eggs to the Yonghe Cloth and Cocoon Shop to demand a refund from Zhang Ziguang. Zhang refused, leading to a dispute. Finally, the villagers seized 300 yuan in cash from the shop's counter drawer as collateral for the refusal to refund the money. The neighbors rumored that it was a robbery.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Thoroughly Investigates Illegal Construction: The Jiuchang Silk Shop in the north of the city violated the construction regulations of the Municipal Construction Preparatory Office. They renovated the building while deceiving the Municipal Office into believing it was a repair to avoid paying taxes. People from all walks of life in the city were outraged, saying that a certain shop in the Shuyuan Alley had its rafters cut off to decorate the storefront last year and was penalized by the Municipal Office. Now, Jiuchang is taking advantage of loopholes without anyone intervening, which is unfair. Sun Zuji, the County Magistrate and Director of the Municipal Office, heard about the matter and ordered the police to seal off the shop the previous night and detain eight workers. He also arrested Wang Yanqing, the manager, for investigation and punishment. Wang Yanqing and the foreman Shi Shunquan surrendered themselves for interrogation and volunteered to comply with the regulations and pay taxes. County Magistrate Sun approved their release on bail after they paid.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Important Meeting of the Funds and Property Office: The Wuyi Funds and Property Office convened a meeting on the afternoon of the 2nd.

After the approval of the Standing Committee of the Labor Union, payments can be made accordingly. (3) The Office will not recognize any payments made by the Finance Bureau that do not follow the budget. If there is no effective solution in the future, the tax revenue will be transferred to the Bureau for management. (4) Organize a Defense Expense Review Committee to review the accounts before submitting them to the meeting for discussion.</p>
<p>Resignation of the President of the County Court: Wu Zengshan, the President of the Wuyi County Court, has been in office for two months. Due to the large number of lawsuits and the fact that the court is in its early stages of establishment, the management has been taxing. As a result of accumulated labor, his old liver and stomach ailments have been triggered in the spring. He telegraphed the High Court yesterday requesting his resignation.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Another Dispute Arises Over the Arrest of the Monk Chengwu: Xu Guangye, the head of the Zhouxiang Security Corps, was arresting a resident monk from the Puji Temple when he was snatched away by villagers.

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Important News on the Provincial Road Labor Levy: The County Government has strictly ordered all districts to expedite the labor levy for road construction. Recently, the Construction Bureau submitted a report to the County, ordering the First District Office to quickly investigate the household registration on both sides of the Zhen-Hu and Ning-Zhen roads, and to prepare registers for labor levy, labor exemption, and cash payment in lieu of labor, in order to organize the project on schedule. It is estimated that the Zhen-Hu Road passes through the Yonggu Township in the First District for about four miles. After the previous investigation, the First District compiled the results of each household registration and prepared registers for labor levy, labor exemption, and cash payment in lieu of labor. These registers are now complete. Regarding the cash payment issue, as the two townships suffered a poor harvest last year, following the directive of the Construction Department to use labor in lieu of cash, they are unable to afford the cash payment and should be exempted from preparing the register. The remaining registers have been compiled by the First District and submitted to the County for approval.</p>
<p>Bidding for the Zhongshan Road Project: The construction committee has designated the section of Zhongshan Road from Zhugan Lane to Beimen Street as the third phase of the project, and ordered the shops on both sides to be demolished. The shops on both sides have now been almost completely demolished. The construction committee convened a meeting yesterday to invite bidders to the site. The bidders included Zhenjiang Wang Rongji, Shanghai Zhou Yongji, Shen Rongji, Jiashi Construction Factory, Nanjing Shicheng Construction Factory, and Chunyuan Jinji, totaling six companies. Pu Ji's bid was the highest, at 139,955 yuan, while Jiashi Factory's bid was the lowest, at 96,757.80 yuan. It is said that the bids will be submitted to the provincial government for approval.</p>

<p>Bandits Captured: The bandit Zhu Zhengnan joined the bandit gang last winter and robbed Yan Dacheng's family in the northern countryside, killing the headman's brother, Daxing. He also abducted Yan Zhou's mother-in-law and Yan Ma's clan together. The master of the house prepared a price of two hundred and fifty yuan, and only redeemed Yan Zhou. Yan Ma was defiled by Zhu’s gang. In February of this year, during the Gan Tai Yi Du Shan Ji incident, an encounter with government troops forced the dispersion. Yan Ma then lured the bandit to Houjiaqiao to take shelter. The people reported it to the people's regiment, and Zhu was captured and sent to court.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Request to Repair the Canal Embankment: The canal embankment in the Baotawan area outside the South Gate of this county has been in disrepair for many years and is gradually collapsing. With the spring floods approaching, the danger is imminent. The local people, including Kong Haibin, have collectively discussed the matter and submitted a request to the county government to start repairs. It is said that the county government has forwarded the request to the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Office for survey and repair.</p>
<p>Borrow Funds to Purchase Grain and Stabilize Prices: This county suffered a severe drought last year, with the western mountains being the most affected, with an average harvest of less than 20%. This spring, the supply is scarce, causing rice prices to rise steadily. The ninth district office plans to borrow 10,000 yuan from the Jiangsu Farmers' Bank or the Jiangdu Grain Reserve, using local land deeds as collateral, to purchase grain from other provinces and stabilize prices to provide relief to the people. It is said that the district chief has submitted a request to the county government for approval.</p>

<p>Express Boat Robbed at Hexi: A night boat from Hexi to Huzhou in Changxing County set off from Hexi on the afternoon of the 31st of last month. It was late in the evening when it passed through Lushan Town. The passengers, fearing the worst, asked the boat owner to stop and stay overnight in Lushan, but the boat owner refused and continued on. Before traveling three li, they saw a bandit with a Mauser pistol standing on a small bridge, ordering them to stop. The boat heard the order and stopped. Suddenly, three unarmed bandits speaking with a Henan accent jumped onto the boat and were about to search it when a steamboat happened to pass by. The three bandits on the boat immediately disembarked and fled, and the bandit with the gun also ran away. After the steamboat had sailed far away, the bandits continued to rob the boat, stealing all the clothing and money carried by the passengers. The boat arrived at the port this morning.

<p>Overview of the Venue</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third day of the National Games opening. The weather in the morning was exceptionally cold and gloomy, with a continuous drizzle. The sound of water droplets was clearly audible. Fortunately, the construction of the main venue was well-prepared, and the earthwork was solid. However, it had been infiltrated and was muddy and slippery. The organizers, to show their spirit, stipulated that the competition schedule for the morning would proceed as usual, except for brief pauses during heavy rain. The rain stopped abruptly around noon, and the weather turned sunny and mild, but the temperature remained unusually cold, resembling winter. Athletes from various provinces wore heavy cotton clothing. The competition started at 1 PM, and guests and spectators flocked to the venue. Cars and streetcars queued up in front of the venue gate, causing extreme congestion. The scene was very lively. Many events had reached the semi-final or final stage, making the competitions particularly exciting. The general situation of the venue today is recorded separately below:</p>
<h3>Order Well Maintained</h3>
<p>The National Games Disciplinary Committee is the highest authority for maintaining order at the Games. The committee members are Yu Jimin, Gao Yunsheng, Zhou Polang, Gu Luliang, Cha Fuhua, Wu Wenbing, Shen Weihan, Li Wei, and eight others.

<p>The Battle Between Shanghai and Hebei</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hebei match started at 1 PM. The referee was Shao Ji, and the inspector was Qian Yiqin. The Shanghai team was superior, mainly consisting of Shanghai basketball stars, so their victory was expected. Hebei's basketball skills were not bad either. Li Jiaxu was the backbone of the team, and his forward rushes and defense were commendable. Shanghai's veterans Lu Zhongen, Liang Guoquan, Tan Dahua, and others were particularly skilled in ground play. However, the court was damp, and the opponents were not considered strong, so the game was not very exciting. The final score was 56 to 16, with Shanghai winning.</p>

<h3>The Game Between Liaoning and Fujian</h3>
<p>Liaoning Team Has Sufficient Strength</p>
<p>Men's basketball: Liaoning wins against Fujian. The Liaoning and Fujian teams met at 2 PM. Liaoning had balanced talent, sufficient strength, and was good at using the five-man zone defense for defense. Fujian was suppressed from beginning to end and had no chance to penetrate the enemy camp. The first half ended with a score of 41 to 10. In the second half, Liaoning's momentum was even greater, and Fujian became more disorganized, only able to shoot from long range. Their offense was ultimately fruitless. The final score was 89 to 16, with Liaoning winning.</p>

<h3>The Game Between Zhejiang and Anhui</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Wins Against Anhui. After the women's basketball game between Tianjin and Beijing, Zhejiang and Anhui took the stage one after another. The court was not yet dry, and the Zhejiang players mostly wore straw sandals to play, which boosted their morale. In the first half, Zhejiang was in full swing and invincible. Anhui only scored one point. In the second half, Anhui gradually showed signs of improvement and increased their score, but it was a fleeting moment. Soon, they were subdued by Zhejiang again. The final score was 36 to 15. The referee was Xu Zhendong, the inspector was Shu Hong, and the recorder was Sun Daosheng. Their records are attached below.</p>

<h3>Women's Basketball</h3>
<p>Preliminary (1) Guangdong Wins Big Against Hubei</p>
<p>42 to 10</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, after the Liaoning-Fujian game, the Guangdong and Hubei sisters took the stage one after another. Guangdong was agile and lively, while Hubei was dignified and experienced. Both sides selected their territory and began to attack. Hubei scored two points first, and Guangdong did not dare to underestimate them. They quickly followed up and the forwards passed quickly, making good progress. In the first half, Guangdong won 15 to 8. In the second half, Guangdong's Lu Huixian and Li Huiming were flexible, throwing from long distances and near shots, hitting the basket every time. Lu alone scored 19 points, and Li scored 14 points. Hubei's Hu Wenkuan was also good at throwing the ball, but without assistance, she could not give full play to her strengths. The final score was 42 to 10, with Guangdong winning.</p>

<p>Basketball game between Tianjin and Jiangxi Wang Kai photo</p>
<p>(2) Tianjin Wins Over Beijing B</p>
<p>19 to 10</p>
<p>Held in the Rain</p>
<p>Last night, it rained in Hangzhou all night. This morning (3rd), the women's basketball game between Tianjin and Beijing Team B was held. The basketball court was wet, and servants had swept away the accumulated water from the floor and wiped it dry with towels, but the weather played tricks, and rain fell again after wiping, making it as wet as before. The referee, restricted by the Games rules, held the game in the rain.</p>
<h3>Few Spectators</h3>
<p>The stands were empty on all sides, with very few spectators. One reason was the rain, and another was the early hour. Apart from the hundred or so athletes, there were almost no outside spectators.</p>
<p>The Tianjin athletes organized a cheerleading squad to support their sisters, creating a great atmosphere and generating a lot of excitement.</p>
<h3>Fierce Game Situation</h3>
<p>Both sides selected their positions, and the referee announced the start of the game. The Tianjin center dribbled the ball, and the left forward Mu Xiangshu passed it to the right. Sun Jiaying rushed up and caught it, raising her jade hand high, and the ball entered the basket. Center Liu Junyuan then made a free throw, scoring another point. Beijing, suffering this setback, quickly launched a counterattack. Wu Ruixiu also scored one point. The Tianjin forwards tightly pressed the enemy camp, and Sun Jiaying was particularly good at shooting. They finished the first quarter with a score of 10 to 1. In the second quarter, the competition between the two sides was even fiercer, but due to the slippery court, they stumbled and could not fully display their talents. At the end of the first half, Tianjin won 16 to 3. After a lemon break, the battle resumed. Tianjin replaced several reserve players, slightly weakening their strength. Beijing took this opportunity and launched a fierce attack, trying to fight to the death. The score in the third quarter was 3 to 3. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, Beijing's Wu Ruixiu made consecutive shots, drastically changing the situation. However, Tianjin's defense was solid, and they could not do as they pleased. At the sound of the whistle, time was up. Tianjin won 19 to 10. The scores of each quarter were 10|1, 6|2, 3|3, 0|4. The referees were Song Junfu and Zhang Huilan.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Has Better Skills</h3>
<p>In this game, both sides were unable to fully display their true abilities due to the rain. However, Tianjin's passing did not diminish due to the slippery court. The guards were particularly steady. Beijing's forwards had good coordination, but they put too much force into their shots, often missing the basket.</p>

<h3>Preliminary: Shanghai Wins Big Against Hunan</h3>
<p>A Score of Two to Zero</p>
<p>Shanghai Performs Very Well</p>
<p>The Shanghai team has a wealth of talent and sufficient strength. Many players are veterans of numerous battles, with pure skills and rich experience. They are also qualified to win the championship in this Games. The Hunan team is known for its courage and endurance, but its skills and experience are far behind. Furthermore, its coordination is not strict. Meeting such a strong enemy in the first game, it is no wonder that they were suppressed everywhere and had no room for progress. It is fortunate that they were able to avoid being blanked. After the start of the game, the Shanghai team had smooth sailing and was invincible. They won the first game 21 to 1. In the second game, the Hunan team's morale was low, and the troops had no will to fight. The Shanghai team won effortlessly again with a score of 21 to 3. The result was 2 to 0, with Shanghai winning. The referee was Tan Tianpei. The lineup is as follows:</p>

<p>Zhejiang Defeats Jiangxi</p>
<p>Poor Performances All Around</p>
<p>Zhejiang Team Slightly Better</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the third day, the preliminary women's volleyball match between Zhejiang and Jiangxi took place. The two teams' strengths were evenly matched. Due to the rain and wet ground, neither side's performance was particularly impressive. However, Si Yasha of the Zhejiang team showed some power in hitting and returning the ball, making her a standout player. In the first set, Zhejiang had a significant advantage, with their score rapidly increasing. Zhang Xingxiao and Shen Wanzhen scored seven points successively. The Jiangxi team only had one point. Zhejiang then reached the target of eleven points first. Afterwards, Jiangxi's offense gradually improved, and their score also increased to eleven. However, Zhejiang also made rapid progress. At thirteen to ten, when Dai Pu served, she won seven consecutive points, taking the lead at twenty to ten. After each team scored one point, Zhejiang won the first set 21-11.</p>
<p>At the start of the second set, Zhejiang continued their offensive momentum, gaining an eight-to-one advantage. Jiangxi refused to be left behind and quickly caught up. Zhang Yaode's serve was particularly effective, earning six consecutive points, bringing them closer to the Zhejiang team. The situation then became even, with both sides scoring points. However, Jiangxi gradually gained the upper hand and eventually won the second set 21-19.</p>
<p>After each team won one set, the third set became the decisive one, leading to an increasingly tense competition. However, the Zhejiang team had more balanced talent and better teamwork. Si Yasha's serve earned six points, greatly boosting their morale. The Jiangxi team's formation was scattered, and their responses were often flawed, ultimately leading to a 21-9 defeat. As a result, Zhejiang won 2-1. The referee was Wu Bangwei. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>

<p>At 1:00 PM on the third day, the preliminary women's volleyball match between Tianjin and Hunan teams took place. The Tianjin team's players had strong physiques and were impressively spirited. The Hunan team was agile and lively, with slender figures, and their bravery and skill were immediately apparent. At the start, Tianjin gained three points first. Hunan served and then overtook them with six points. The battle between the two sides was extremely intense, and their scores remained close throughout. When Hunan switched sides with a score of eleven to seven, the Tianjin team suddenly launched a fierce attack. All three rows coordinated and responded, which was quite effective. Fortunately, the Hunan team defended well, especially Yang Ren in the middle row, who was the most outstanding. Her ability to press the ball was quick and powerful, swift as a rabbit, and her ball saves were calm and composed, with a perfect balance of lightness and strength. She never failed to hit the ball, and her serve was heavy and powerful, often making it impossible for the opponent to return. She was very competent in her role of coordinating and directing the whole situation. However, because the connection on the communication aspect was lacking, it was easy for the other side to take advantage. The Tianjin team eventually won the first set 21-19. Judging by the closeness of the scores, one can see how fierce the competition was at the time. In the continued battle in the second set, the Tianjin team mustered their remaining strength and continued to attack, initially taking an eleven to three lead, then fourteen to five, and then continuously gaining seven points to win 21-10. As a result, Tianjin won 2-0. The referee was Tan Tianpei. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Tianjin Team　　First Row　　Second Row　Third Row</p>
<p>Liu Wenzhen　　Zhang Xixian　Yan Jianyun</p>
<p>Liu Guangzhen　　Gao Peiying　　Zhu Yingxun</p>
<p>Bi Haifen　　Liu Junwan　　Zhang Shuyi</p>
<p>Xing JiYuan　　Wang Xun　　　Yang Zijun</p>
<p>Hunan Team　　Zeng Xianzhen　　　Li Xin　　　Xu Shihua</p>
<p>Zhou Taizhen　Xu Shen　　　Duan Meiqing</p>
<p>Su Jing　　Yang Ren　　Peng Zehua</p>
<p>Luo Mengfang　　Chen Jiajun　　Tao Yun</p>
<h3>Shanghai B Defeats Jiangsu</h3>
<p>The Shanghai B and Jiangsu teams had their preliminary match at 2:00 PM. The talents of the two teams were about the same. However, the Jiangsu team had less experience and a scattered formation, which constantly gave the opponent opportunities to attack. This was the main reason for their defeat. At the beginning of the match, the Jiangsu team once took a six to four lead, but unfortunately, their ball reception and return were extremely panicked. Pang Guiying and Xu Huiying of the Shanghai team showed great skill in pressing the ball, and their serve was powerful. The scores also increased continuously. Before long, they won the first set 21-11. After the continued battle, although the Jiangsu team rallied their spirits and tried to turn defeat into victory, they also gained an eleven to nine advantage. However, the Shanghai team was mostly composed of veterans. Seeing that the situation was not good, they all acted cautiously and were very calm. Their ball return and saves were steady and legitimate. The entire team coordinated well, leaving the opponent with no loopholes to exploit. Afterwards, the scores gradually increased again, and they won the second set 21-17. The referee was Qiu Jixiang.</p>

<h3>Prediction for Track and Field Championships</h3>
<p>Liaoning and Shanghai Have Reached a Stage of Intense Competition</p>
<p>But the Liaoning Team Seems to Have More Hope</p>
<p>The Women's Championship Is Still Up for Grabs</p>
<p>In the men's track and field competition, the Shanghai and Liaoning teams have reached a stage of intense competition. Liaoning excels in track events, while Shanghai has the advantage in field events. As a result, Liaoning has already overtaken Shanghai by three points. The only events yet to be decided are the 200 meters, javelin, pole vault, and 10,000 meters. Liaoning's Liu Changchun is guaranteed to win the 200 meters, with Shanghai's Zhong Lianji in second place. In the 10,000 meters, Liaoning's Jiang Yunlong and Zhao Desheng are likely to be too strong for Shanghai's Chen Xuzhou. Shanghai's Wang Lihuai has a better chance in the javelin. Liaoning's Sun Guangchen will definitely secure a position in the pole vault. Predicting the track and field championship, Liaoning has slightly more hope than Shanghai. If Shanghai can win both the javelin and pole vault, they may be able to compete with Liaoning.</p>
<p>In the women's track and field competition, Beiping currently has 9.5 points, in first place. Guangdong is in second place with six points. However, Dongte (Special Eastern District) excels in track events. Liaoning's Sun Guiyun has a good chance in the high jump. In the 50 meters and 100 meters, the Guangdong team can compete with Dongte. Therefore, Guangdong and Dongte will likely score the most points in the women's championship, while the runner-up will be contested by Beiping and Liaoning. After today's battles, the outcome will be known.</p>
<h3>Visiting Groups</h3>
<p>Local organizations and commercial groups in this city took the early express train and special express train from Shanghai to Hangzhou the day before yesterday (31st) to visit the National Games and tour West Lake in Hangzhou. It is now learned that the merchants of the organizations and groups will return to Shanghai by train from Hangzhou on Sunday (6th) of this month. Therefore, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Transportation Office, in order to treat tourists for the convenience, specially ordered ten first- and second-class passenger cars yesterday, scheduled to depart from Hangzhou at 5:50 a.m. on the sixth of this month, and arrive at the North Station in Shanghai at about 11:20 a.m.</p>
<p>In addition to the Faculty of Engineering's Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Faculty of Social Sciences' Department of Economics and Department of Sociology, with a total of more than 100 people, and about 70 graduates from the secondary school this term, all of whom are dispatched by the school to Hangzhou for visits, there are also dozens of students from the National Labor University who spontaneously organized a spring break visit group and planned to visit the National Games. The total number of people is more than 200, and the departure is scheduled for the 1st of this month from Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Brief Review of Yesterday's Track and Field Events</h3>
<p>Triple Jump Final</p>
<p>Guangdong's Situ Guang Emerged as a Dark Horse, breaking the national record in the triple jump with 13.39 meters. Liaoning's Xiao Dinghua ranked second with a distance of 13.10, which is also a considerable result. Xiao Dinghua was known as the "Flying Grass" in the triple jump, but his performance was slightly inferior, probably because he had just finished the high jump competition. However, the result is still satisfactory. Situ Guang had excellent posture when jumping. In the second jump, he clenched his teeth and jumped one step at a time, creating a new record of 13.39 meters. However, it is still a little short of the Far Eastern record of 15.35 meters. According to Mr. Situ, this result is not his best, so with further efforts, he can be relied on at the Far Eastern Games. The fact that Minister Wang Zhengting created a large silver cup for the new national record is another matter.</p>

<h3>Discus Throw Final</h3>
<p>The discus throw result of 31.87 meters is not very satisfactory. The results of the weight throw, shot put, and discus throw in the past two days have not been great. I don't know why. In the first three pre-throws, Liaoning's Zhang Shi'an took the lead with 30.28 meters in the second throw. In the last three throws, Beiping's Zhao Wenzao jumped to first place with 31.87 meters, and the ranking was determined.</p>
<h3>Women's High Jump Final</h3>
<p>In the women's track and field competition, Guangdong's Chen Peitao broke the national record with 38.46 meters in the baseball throw the day before yesterday. Yesterday, in the high jump final, Hubei's Ms. Feng Falan broke the national record again with a result of 1.1 meters. More than 20 people started the competition. When the height jumped to 1.13 meters, there were 7 people left, who were the seven ladies who scored points. What is commendable is that all seven ladies broke the national record (the national record of Li Suiyin is 1.10 meters). In the next jump, Ms. Feng, Xiao and Cheng cleared the height of 1.19 meters. Finally, Hubei's Ms. Feng Falan created a new national record with 1.422 meters. After the competition, Beiping's Ms. Xiao Meizhen burst into tears. Everyone quickly comforted her. It is said that Ms. Xiao can jump 4 feet 6 inches high in Beiping, which is about 1.40 meters. Now, she tied for second place with Nanjing's Cheng Enci, which seems to be a pity. This is also a good story.</p>
<h3>Men's 100m Final</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the men's 100-meter final was held, and the north and south elites competed against each other. The excitement of the spectators also reached its peak. After drawing positions, Zhong Lianji was in the outer lane second line, and Liu Changchun was in the third line. At the first shot, everyone except Liu false started. The second time was the same. It wasn't until the third time that they officially set off. However, Liu failed to start too slowly and fell between third and fourth place. When he was near 80 meters, Zhong Lianji was in the lead, and Liu was still a few inches behind. At the moment of reaching the point, the hammer was still in the lead. Liu leaped hard, and his right shoulder touched the white line at the finish line first, winning first place.</p>
<p>The distance from the hammer was less than an inch, which was also very dangerous. The third and fourth places were won by Shanghai's Jiang Peng and Hao Chunde. Tianjin's Zhou Zhaoyuan was fifth and failed to be selected. However, all were less than one step away from the first full, almost indistinguishable, which was a great sight. However, yesterday it had just stopped raining, and the track was loose and wet, so it was impossible to use strength, resulting in a sharp drop in results, which was almost impossible to recover by human power. This newspaper predicted nineteen correctly, and can be acquitted.</p>
<h3>Men's 400m Final</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon in the 400-meter final, Liu Changchun was in first place when he started.</p>
<p>When he reached 300 meters, he tried harder, almost a Zhang (unit of measure) away from Guangdong's Mai Guozhen in second place. The score was 52 and three-fifths of a second, which was better than the previous two days and broke the national record, but it was still worse than the score he ran in Liaoning, but it was still the most outstanding result of yesterday's conference.</p>

<h3>1500m Final</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the men's 1500-meter final, Liaoning's long-distance running athletes Jiang Yunlong and Zhao Dexin won the first and second places, which was true skill. At the start of the race, Jiangsu's Song Ze was in the first position, Liaoning's Zhao Dexin was in the second, Beiping's Fan Baoen was in the third, and Liaoning's Jiang Yunlong was in the fourth. In the second lap, Liaoning's Zhao and Jiang caught up and took the first and second positions. Song fell to third, and Fan to fourth. In the third lap, the first and second places did not change, Fan was third, and Song was fourth. In the last half lap, Song tried desperately to catch up, and Fan fell behind again. The first and second places did not change. When he was about 100 meters away from the finish line, Jiang Yunlong clenched his teeth and sprinted Zhao Dexin, winning the top spot. The results were also good, but it was still two seconds worse than the results he ran in Liaoning.</p>
<h3>High Hurdles Final</h3>
<p>The result of yesterday's high hurdles final was unexpected. Liaoning's famous general Xiao Dinghua was unfortunately ranked third. At the start, Beiping's Wang Yuzhen was in the lead, followed by Xiao, and Fujian's Yao Shaozhou was third. At 80 meters, Lin sprinted bravely and leaped over, Xiao Dinghua seemed to be exhausted and unable to catch up, so Lin won the championship. Unfortunately, Liaoning team's track and field points also suffered a major blow because of this.</p>
<h3>Women's 100m Semi-Final</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the women's 100-meter semi-final, Dongte's Sun Guiyun was still in the lead in the first group, and it was as easy as reaching into a pocket to win the championship in the final. According to the reporter's observation, Sun Guiyun will be first, Guangdong's Huang Shuwei and Liu Youqing will compete for second and third, and the fourth place may be Dongte's Wang Yuan. Also, yesterday, due to the rain, Sun Yun's results were greatly different. If it can be sunny today, a new record may be created.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren Donates Sun Yat-sen's Handwriting</h3>
<p>Central Committee member Mr. Yu Youren yesterday sent 50 copies of Premier Sun Yat-sen's handwriting to the National Games, titled "Shangwu Lou" (Martial Arts Building), with a postscript by Mr. Yu that read: "The three characters of Shangwu Lou were written by Premier Sun Yat-sen and given to the Chinese Martial Arts Association. The Premier did not study calligraphy in his life, nor did he have time to study calligraphy, but his profound and profound air naturally entered the ancients, and the calligraphy he asked people to write was also high. The Chinese National Games will be held in Hangzhou, so I asked Comrade Wu Zhiqing to ask for a copy and donate it to the winners. I especially hope that the Premier's fighting spirit will spread throughout the country. Nineteen years of the Huanghuagang Memorial Day, Yu Youren respectfully recorded."</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>The Rescue Team on the Sports Field Photo by Wang Kai</p>
<p>Short-Distance King</p>
<p>Ms. Sun Guiyun, who broke the East Asian short-distance running record, is an outstanding talent in track and field. She is likely to win this conference. Ms. Sun is a graduate of Harbin Municipal No. 1 Elementary School and a first-year student of the Women's First Middle School High School. She is only sixteen years old, but she has achieved such results, which is commendable. She usually wears a khaki woolen coat, blue pants, white shirt, and black leather shoes, and her face is dark and unpainted. She is completely a northern girl.</p>
<h3>Mini Bank</h3>
<p>The Organizing Committee of the Conference, in order to protect the players' money, set up a silver money storage office in front of the dormitory. Many people deposit money every day, starting with five yuan, without interest, and can be withdrawn with a deposit slip. There are four staff members in the office, who are extremely busy, because in addition to storing silver, they also exchange money and sell coupons.</p>
<h3>Avoiding Exploitation</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Bureau of Public Works, because rickshaws and automobiles often exploit foreign tourists and athletes, formulated a price list to standardize the prices and avoid exploitation. The cost of a rickshaw from the venue to the train station is two jiao (unit of currency) of silver coins, to the lakeside is one jiao and twenty copper coins, to Qinghefang is one jiao of silver coins and twenty copper coins, to Sanlang Temple is three jiao of silver coins and sixteen copper coins, to Qingbomen and Yue Tomb or Zhongshan Park is three jiao of silver, Lingyin is five jiao and twenty, Jing Temple is three jiao and twenty, Liuhe Pagoda is five jiao and twelve, Zhijiang University is six jiao and four, and Gongchen Bridge is four jiao and sixteen. The cost of a car to the train station is one yuan and five jiao, the lakeside is one yuan, Qinghefang is two yuan, Yue Tomb Lingyin Park and Jing Temple are all two yuan and five jiao, and Liuhe Pagoda is four yuan and five jiao. After this is stipulated, the players pay according to the regulations, which is extremely convenient.</p>
<h3>Each Displays Its Own Banner</h3>
<p>The dormitories for male and female athletes each accommodate 32 people, and each room has a banner of the respective province to show identification. The styles and colors of the banners in each district are different. If they are gathered together, they can open a banner exhibition.</p>
<h3>Component of Letters</h3>
<p>There is a mailbox in front of the conference, for the convenience of athletes to send letters. According to the postal worker who collects the letters, there are more than a thousand letters and postcards every day. About 40% of these are family reports, 10% are letters reporting victories, and at least half are love letters from lovers.</p>
<p>Women's 50-meter Preliminary Finish Line Photo by Wang Kai</p>
<h3>Tears Streaming Down</h3>
<p>Xiao Meishen, a female athlete from Beiping with number 519, has a great reputation for the high jump. Yesterday, she ranked second in the final, so she cried a lot, because she was crying because she didn't win first place.</p>
<h3>Somersaults</h3>
<p>The basketball court is very well arranged. The surface is made of fir wood, which is as bright as a mirror. Yesterday afternoon, it was drizzling, and the court became exceptionally slippery. As a result, when the players were fighting for the ball, you fought and I slipped, I fought and you fell, somersaulting a lot.</p>
<h3>Blood Stains</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon during the track and field competition, in the women's 100-meter relay preliminary round, Ms. Zhan Zongzeng of Tianjin with number 568 suddenly fell in the middle of the race, injuring her left arm and right leg. At the same time, Ms. Xu Bangai of Tianjin with number 570 also injured her right arm and left leg. The team immediately helped them to the Red Cross ambulance team for treatment. According to Dr. Zhang, it was just a skin injury and nothing serious. The two ladies had blood stains on their arms and legs, and the pain was very severe, so they cried together. At the same time, the instructor was beside them, constantly comforting them, and the ladies began to leave with pain.</p>
<h3>Breaking Class</h3>
<p>Tickets are divided into general tickets and sub-venue tickets. The general ticket price is two yuan, which is valid for the entire period and allows access to all venues. Sub-venue tickets are sold daily at prices of one jiao and two jiao. One jiao is standing, and two jiao is seated. Yesterday, because it was wet due to rain, it was impossible to sit. Although the tickets have different grades, the standing is the same. Therefore, those who bought two jiao tickets regretted it after entering the venue.</p>
<h3>Rescue Statistics</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rescue room treated 33 people, including Sun Guiyun and Liu Jingzhen, female track and field athletes from Harbin. Sun Guiyun was overstressed from continuous efforts in the competition, resulting in leg pain. Liu Jingzhen was injured on April 1st and has been going to the clinic for treatment every day, and has gradually recovered. Today, there were multiple people who fell and injured themselves. The people who were treated are listed below, divided into categories: Trauma surgery, 24 people; internal medicine, 8 people; otolaryngology, 2 people; ophthalmology, 2 people; dentistry, 2 people.</p>
<h3>Great Efforts</h3>
<p>Important officials such as Ma Xun, Wu Bangwei, and Huang Yuandao have been carefully planning the venue, carefully considering where to put fences, where to put signs, and where to add decorations. They also put in great effort to check frequently. The order of the venue is well organized. Ma and others have put in a lot of hard work, which is worth praising.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance's Reply to the National Federation of Commerce and Industry</h3>
<p>Revising Tariff Regulations</p>
<p>Paying Attention to Business Conditions</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance previously received a telegram from the National Federation of Commerce and Industry regarding the new stamp tax law and the plan to convene various businesses to study the matter. On the 3rd, it replied to the federation, stating that the stamp tax is based on the principle of universality, and the meaning of the tax law is very broad, encompassing all matters such as behavior taxes and handling fees. The tax obligation is not limited to the business community. Moreover, the revision of the tax law has already collected opinions from various provinces, and special attention has been paid to business conditions to ensure that there are no violations.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Government Forcibly Orders Overseas Chinese to Use French Bookkeeping</h3>
<p>National Federation of Commerce and Industry Cables for Diplomatic Intervention</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce and Industry yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating: "To the Honorable Ministries of Industry and Commerce and Foreign Affairs of the National Government in Nanjing: On March 31 of this year, we received a confidential telegram from the representatives of the Vietnamese Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Xi Kezhen and Chen Youqin, stating: 'To the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce: The French Vietnamese government has set May 1st to forcibly implement French bookkeeping for Overseas Chinese, greatly hindering Overseas Chinese business. Please immediately appeal to the government to quickly negotiate its cancellation in order to protect Overseas Chinese businesses.' Signed, Representatives of the Vietnamese Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Xi Kezhen and Chen Youqin, respectfully. Upon investigation, most Overseas Chinese in Vietnam do not know French. If they are suddenly forced to switch to French bookkeeping, there will be many difficulties. It is hoped that you will quickly negotiate with the French Minister to allow the use of Chinese characters for Overseas Chinese business and industrial bookkeeping in order to alleviate the Overseas Chinese' difficulties. Respectfully requested, Chairman Lin Kanghou, Standing Committee Members Su Minsheng, Zhang Yuquan, Lu Guangji, Chen Riping, Li Kuian, Peng Chuli, and others of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China." Sealed.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Oppose Postage Increase</h3>
<p>Renewed Efforts</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation of the Republic of China yesterday telegraphed the Party and government agencies, stating: "To the Honorable Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, the Executive Yuan of the National Government, and the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; To the Honorable Ministry of Communications, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and Construction Committee: It has been found that the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications initiated a case to abolish the Overseas Chinese private postal services and increase postage rates. The subordinate associations have repeatedly telegraphed requests to dismiss the communications authorities and immediately revoke the original case. Recently, the association received telegrams and attached English petitions from various organizations in Singapore requesting a reduction in private postal fees at the Overseas Chinese assembly. Upon investigation, this case was initiated by the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications of our country, with official documents from the Ministry of Communications No. 65 and repeated letters from the Postal Administration to the Postmaster General of Singapore as evidence. The Postal Administration dared not inquire with the Singapore government but inquired with the Kuala Lumpur post office, which shows the falsehood and evasion of the situation. They still use the Universal Postal Convention as an excuse. The Universal Postal Convention did not start today. Previously, the British and Dutch governments announced indefinite extensions of the Universal Postal Convention, which is a matter of record. The Universal Postal Convention is not applicable to Overseas Chinese. It is inevitable to become a laughingstock among friendly nations to threaten Overseas Chinese with this. In short, the responsibility for untying the knot lies with the communications authorities. If the government is determined to abandon the Overseas Chinese, then there is nothing more to say. If it believes that Overseas Chinese should be treated as citizens and have made minor contributions to the revolution, then the communications authorities should be punished as they deserve to appease the people. At the same time, it should quickly issue an order to the whole country and notify various countries to continue to fulfill the old agreement of indefinite extension in order to show the reality of protecting Overseas Chinese. This urgent telegram expresses our indignation incompletely. Respectfully, the Overseas Chinese Federation." Sealed.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Reduces Postage for Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Telegraphic Order to Postal Administration to Negotiate with British Post</p>
<p>Since the British Kuala Lumpur post office took measures to suppress private postal services, Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and various organizations have sent letters and telegrams to our government requesting a reduction in postage (international regulations stipulate a postage rate of one cent for every letter weighing up to twenty grams). It is reported that Director Liu Shufan has returned to Beijing from Shanghai and has discussed the matter with the Minister and Vice Minister of Communications. In order to comply with the wishes of the Overseas Chinese, it has been decided to make appropriate adjustments.</p>
<p>For letters sent by our national private postal services to various places in British Southeast Asia, it is proposed to charge a postage rate of five cents for each letter weighing up to twenty grams. The Postal Administration has been ordered by telegram to earnestly negotiate with the British post to handle the matter. The content of the Ministry's telegram is as follows: "To the Postal Administration Office: The case of the British postal service requesting an increase in fees for letters from private postal services in the Southeast Asian region has been repeatedly appealed to by Overseas Chinese organizations in letters and telegrams. The Ministry, understanding the situation, knows that the Overseas Chinese side does have difficulties. In order to comply with the wishes of the Overseas Chinese, appropriate adjustments should be made. Hereafter, letters sent by private postal services to various British territories in Southeast Asia should be charged a fee of five cents for each letter weighing up to twenty grams to show compassion and comfort the Overseas Chinese. You are to earnestly negotiate with the British postal service to reach a decision without delay. Ministry of Communications."</p>

More than one hundred people attended. It was resolved to appoint Chen Chunan, Xu Jigong, Chen Zhiying, Zheng Qizhong, Zhu Xiajiu, Lin Jingxian, Zhuo Wuchu, and others as general representatives.

<h3>Customs Superintendent Wu Xiyong Has Arrived at His Post</h3>

<h3>Shen Bingqian Appointed President of the District Court</h3>
<p>Yang Zhaosun, the President of the Shanghai District Court, has been transferred by the Ministry of Judicial Administration to be the President of the Shanghai Special District Court. It was previously said that Wu Yuanchun would fill the vacancy, but the court received an order from the Ministry of Judicial Administration yesterday announcing the appointment of Shen Bingqian, the current Chief Prosecutor of the court, as President, and Liu Maochu as Chief Prosecutor. According to a staff member of the court, President Shen had already been acting as President before receiving the order, and the handover had already been completed, so there were no problems with the takeover. The swearing-in ceremony is expected to be held next Monday.</p>
<h3>New Initiatives of the Special District Court</h3>
<p>Reorganization of Civil and Criminal Courts</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court and the Shanghai Special District Court, the office addresses of the two courts have also been clearly delineated. The newly built building and the 14th Court in the old building are all under the jurisdiction of the Special District Court, as previously reported. President Yang of the Special District Court believed that the names of all the courts in the hospital should be changed immediately. Yesterday, he changed the 9th Court on the third floor of the new building, which previously heard criminal appeals, to the First Court of the Special District Court. The 7th Court on the second floor was changed to the Second Court, the 5th Court downstairs was changed to the Third Court, the 8th Court on the third floor was changed to the Fourth Court, the 6th Court on the second floor was changed to the Fifth Court, and the 14th Court in the old building was changed to the Sixth Court. The courts in the new building adjacent to the old building, formerly known as the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th Courts, were changed to the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th Courts. In total, there are more than ten civil and criminal courts in the Special District Court. A horizontal strip with the number of the court is pasted on the door of each court for identification.</p>
<h3>Preliminary and Local Trials to be Heard Separately</h3>
<p>President Yang also stated that the civil and criminal cases accepted by the court should be heard separately at the preliminary and local levels in order to clarify the system of four levels and three trials. This system of trial levels was once implemented during the time when Xu Weizhen was the first President of the Provisional Court. However, after Lu Xingyuan succeeded Xu, he stopped this system and continued the old mixed system, with preliminary and local trials not being heard separately. Now that it has been reorganized into a judicial organ suitable for our country's legal system, the boundaries should be clarified. President Yang designated the newly renamed Fifth Court as the place for hearing preliminary criminal cases, and designated the newly renamed Sixth Court to exclusively hear cases of violation of police regulations, such as traffic violations and violations of health regulations. All cases are to be sent to this court for trial. Therefore, every morning, the cases submitted by the twelve police stations of the Public Concession to the Special District Court for handling are first those belonging to the preliminary and violation of police regulations categories. Those belonging to the local level are then assigned to the First, Second, and Third Courts for trial. The First Court exclusively hears cases from the General Police Station and the Laoza Police Station. The Second Court hears cases from the Jing'an Temple, Gordon Road, Putuo Road, Xinzha, and Huishi police stations. The Third Court hears cases from the Hongkou, Yangshupu, Harbin, Tissot Road, and Huishan police stations.</p>

<h3>Decline in North and South Ocean Shipping</h3>
<p>Foreign Shipping Lines Increase Freight Rates Again</p>
<p>After the increase in freight rates from Shanghai to the Beiyang ports on April 1st, it has been learned that British companies such as Taikoo and Jardine Matheson are also proposing to increase freight rates for export goods shipped from Shanghai to ports such as Andong, Weihaiwei, and Longkou. It has been decided that the freight rates will be increased by one-tenth of the original rates, following the example of Tianjin freight rates. All customers have been notified.</p>
<p>Yingkou Refuses to Load Japanese Ships</p>
<p>Japanese shipping companies in China have secretly agreed that during the period of renegotiating the Sino-Japanese commercial treaty, all Japanese ships will add new ships in preparation for China's recovery of navigation rights. Japanese businesses are advancing rapidly. The Dalian Steamship Company has specially opened a new shipping route between Shanghai and Yingkou and plans to send four ships to operate on the route. In order to defeat the Chinese shipping industry on this route, the company has built four high-speed oil-powered ships of 4,000 to 5,000 tons, namely the Tianshan Maru, Kunshan Maru, and Qianshan Maru. It was originally planned to start the route in late March. The Chinese merchants in Yingkou learned of this and, fearing that the navigation rights and commercial transportation would be monopolized, agreed to a joint boycott and refused to load Japanese ships. Therefore, the company's Yingkou ship only sailed once and then stopped sailing. It plans to wait for the situation to ease before sailing again, but the route has not been cancelled.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Ship Tax Dispute</p>
<p>Dong Fukai, Director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Guangdong Branch, telegraphed Shanghai, stating that the Guangzhou Customs Superintendent has recently changed the regulations for ship entry. Ships arriving in Guangdong must provide a guarantee, otherwise each ship must pay a deposit of 3,000 yuan. The Guangdong Branch did not comply with this, so it was ordered not to unload goods, hindering transportation and delaying ship schedules. The Shanghai office received the report and has telegraphed the Guangzhou Customs for negotiation.</p>
<p>Decline in Cargo Shipments on All Routes</p>
<p>Since the tense situation began, commercial transportation on all routes, both north and south, has been severely affected, and cargo shipments have declined sharply. First, the North Ocean merchants stopped shipping goods. Second, there were no large shipments of goods from Yantai and Qingdao. In North China, only the export of goods from Dalian Bay was slightly higher. As for South China, cargo shipments from Wenzhou and Fuzhou have also decreased significantly. Only the shipment of raw peanuts and beans from Guangdong is still being loaded. Compared to last month's business, the difference is significant.</p>
<p>Sale of Sakakimaru Ship</p>
<p>When the Japanese Dalian Steamship Company's Sakakimaru ship was built, it was originally designed as a warship. Therefore, it has two engines and can travel more than 20 nautical miles per hour at full power. Guns can also be installed on the deck. Now, the company's new ship, Changchun Maru, is about to be completed and will replace the ship. The Sakakimaru is planned to be sold. It is reported that a certain party in our country plans to purchase this ship and convert it into a warship. It has contacted the Japanese several times, but the price of the ship has not been agreed upon, so the deal has not been completed.</p>
<h3>The Yangtze River Shipping Industry's Decline</h3>
<p>Investigation of Suspended Steamships: Regarding the current suspension of Yangtze River steamships, after China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Sanpei Shipping Company and others requested the shipping guild to convene a meeting of various shipping companies, each company dispatched representatives to participate. After three days of meetings, it was initially decided to dispatch a total of thirteen ships to meet the needs, with further discussions still underway.</p>
<p>Jiang Yu Returns to Shanghai: Yesterday, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received a telegram from the Ministry of Communications, stating that its Yangtze River ship, the Jiang Yu (which had been suspended for the longest period among the Yangtze River ships since last year), has now returned to Shanghai and is expected to arrive from Nanjing today. After this ship returns to Shanghai, it will still need repairs before it can operate. Currently, after days of consultations among Chinese-owned Yangtze River steamships, it is hoped that five ships can be put into operation.</p>
<p>Japanese Qing Raises Water Freight Rates: The six companies operating between Shanghai and Hankou have already agreed to raise freight rates. For goods shipped downstream from Hankou, mainly grains, the local Japanese Qing Shipping Company and its Hankou branch have agreed that, starting from April 15th, the freight rates for various goods such as wheat, soybeans, and sesame transported from Hankou to Shanghai will be increased by 10% across the board, based on the original freight rates.</p>
<p>Decline in Foreign Ships' Outbound Cargo: In recent days, Shanghai's Yangtze River export cargo has suddenly plummeted. The main reasons for this are the strike wave in various upstream ports and the disruption of through transport on the Pinghan Railway. Furthermore, bandits are rampant in the interior of Jiangxi Province and the Shayi area, causing many wealthy people from those areas to flee to Shanghai for safety. Business groups have also suspended shipments, resulting in a sharp decrease in cargo moving upstream. Recently, foreign merchants have also reduced the amount of goods they transship. Since the first of this month, foreign merchant ships in Shanghai have only been carrying 30-40% of their cargo capacity for export. Originally, each foreign ship of British and Japanese lines operating on the Yangtze River could collect at least six to seven thousand taels in freight charges for each outbound voyage, but now each outbound voyage only yields just over two thousand taels in freight.</p>
<p>Decline in Tung Oil Exports: The Yangtze River's tung oil has the most outbound traffic to foreign countries. In the last week of last month, 4,776 barrels were shipped from Hankou to the United States, 330 tons to the United Kingdom, 423 barrels to France, and 335 barrels to Belgium. Since the beginning of this month, due to obstruction of transportation to Shanghai, shipments to Europe have been greatly reduced.</p>
<h3>Conclusion of the Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association's National Goods Market Discussion</h3>

(3) The Finance Committee will audit the accounts and make payments separately. (4) The products solicited by the Solicitation Committee will be handed over to the All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association for distribution, to be used for charitable purposes.</p>
<h3>County Land Registration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received an instruction from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, stating in brief: "Regarding the land registration matters of various counties, a deadline of February 10th was previously set for uniform implementation. While most counties have already begun implementation, those that have not yet done so have been urged by telegram. It should be known that land registration is of great importance and is the irremovable responsibility of the county magistrates. Those that have already begun implementation should complete it by the deadline, and those that have not yet done so should begin it immediately without delay. As for the land registration expenses, it was previously stipulated that they should be remitted monthly. If a certain amount is collected (1,000 yuan) as the standard), it should be remitted to the treasury at any time," etc. County Magistrate Leng considered that the county's registration had already been implemented in compliance with the order and yesterday instructed the Finance Bureau to comply with the order and complete it as soon as possible for reporting.</p>
<h3>The County Construction Bureau Will Collect River Management Funds</h3>
<p>The issue of collecting river management funds in Jiangsu Province has been repeatedly petitioned by merchants from various regions to the Ministry of Communications, requesting its cancellation. The Department of Construction did not approve this, stating that the collection of these funds was originally for repairing inland river embankments, and ordered the county construction bureaus to collect them according to regulations. However, merchants from various regions, due to the heavy burden, are all taking a wait-and-see attitude and not paying. Now, the Shanghai County Construction Bureau has also received an order from the department to start collecting, and will soon send personnel to begin the collection.</p>
<h3>Conversation between Song Derong and Zhou Fugen</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 30th of last month, Song Derong, who was stabbed by foreign soldiers, was lying in Room 34 on the third floor of Renji Hospital. The next day, a gentleman who visited Song said that his mind was still clear, but he felt pain in his waist when he coughed. According to the doctor, his blood vessels had been severed, resulting in excessive bleeding. The wound has now been stitched up, and if it does not become inflamed, his life can be saved. However, he will need two to three weeks of recuperation before he can be considered out of danger. A friend of Song's then consulted with the hospital doctor and obtained permission to take a photograph of him.</p>
<p>Another gentleman visited Zhou Fugen, the overseas Chinese barber who was also injured in the incident. According to Zhou, he had just finished dinner that evening and went out to urinate when he was suddenly attacked by foreign sailors who rushed out of the Chang'e Dancing Hall and stabbed him in the left chest and ribs. Subsequently, he was sent to Renji Hospital by the police. His injuries were minor, so he has been discharged from the hospital. However, he was seriously injured for no reason, and as a common person, he is powerless and can only accept his bad luck. He has two sets of bloodstained clothes, one a Western-style shirt with prominent bloodstains, and the other a Western-style coat with a hole about an inch in size. He also has a Western-style vest, which is kept in the police station.</p>

(G) Regarding the proposal to request the central government to instruct the pharmacy capitalists to implement the mediation decision, it was publicly decided to approve it. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>
<h3>Decrease in Chinese Going to Japan</h3>
<p>Since Japan strictly prohibited laborers and merchants from Fujian from entering the country, those who have been deported back to China have been arriving in droves. In the past week, the number of peddlers, merchants, and laborers from Shanghai going to Japan has greatly decreased, as they fear being rejected upon arrival, which would only result in a waste of travel expenses. Therefore, recently, only a certain Mr. Lin, a kimono merchant from Fujian, has been deported back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Protects the Tombs of the Martyrs</h3>
<p>The Special Municipal Government, considering that the tombs and shrines of the martyrs should be protected, has been instructed by the central government to comply. Recently, it was discovered that the tomb of the martyr Zou Rong is located within the territory of Shanghai County, and the county government was specially ordered to instruct the Public Security Bureau to protect the tombstone and bridge wood, etc. After receiving the order, the county government immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to instruct the relevant branch to protect it properly, so as to prevent any damage.</p>
<h3>News After the End of the National Arts Competition</h3>
<p>Last year, Shanghai gentlemen and merchants Yu Qiaqing, Wang Yiting, Yuan Ludeng, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Jinrong, Zhang Xiaolin, and Du Yuesheng, as well as Commander Xiong and Mayor Zhang, initiated the National Arts Competition, with the aim of promoting national arts and advocating the spirit of martial arts. All proceeds from ticket sales were to be used to comfort the Northeast soldiers and raise funds for disaster relief in Zhejiang. However, as it was the end of the lunar year and there was a mix of rain and snow, only over 16,000 yuan was collected in ticket sales after the opening, while the expenses amounted to over 40,000 yuan. After offsetting the income and expenses, there was a significant shortfall. At that time, Mr. Mei Lanfang was invited to come south, so Zhang Xiaolin and Du Yuesheng consulted with Mr. Mei and other famous opera performers and amateur actors in Shanghai to put on performances at the Grand Theater and the Shanghai Theater to provide financial support. It is estimated that over 50,000 yuan was sold in tickets for both theaters. After deducting the expenses of the National Arts Competition, there was still a surplus of over 20,000 yuan. The original plans were thus able to be implemented in order, such as purchasing biscuits, towels, and brandy to comfort the Northeast soldiers, and allocating 10,000 yuan in silver dollars to the All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association. The association has completed the various procedures in order, and a conclusion meeting was held on the 2nd at Zhang's residence on Huageo Road. All the initiators attended, and the general affairs director, Zhu Buqing, reported on the summary of income and expenses. Yin Zhufu was publicly elected to be responsible for auditing, and the income and expenditure accounts will be published in the newspaper soon to ensure credibility. As for the remaining balance of over 9,000 yuan, it will all be allocated to the All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association to save the disaster victims.</p>

<h3>County Public Security Expenses Submitted to the Province for Subsidy</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government yesterday submitted a request to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for a subsidy for county public security expenses. The original submission stated, "Submission regarding the county's public security expenses, which have been in arrears for three months, leaving the police force without means of support. We earnestly request a prompt subsidy to alleviate the situation. Respectfully submitting the details for your review and consideration." The document quoted instruction No. 1452 from the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, which referred to instruction No. 1223 from the Provincial Government, stating, "The 272nd meeting of the government committee discussed item 4, a proposal by committee member and concurrently Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Miao Bin, regarding the significant arrears in Shanghai County's public security expenses, making it impossible to maintain operations. It was proposed to request a subsidy from provincial funds. It was decided to instruct the Department of Finance to find a way to provide subsidies until the county has adequate public security funds. In addition to distributing this information, it is ordered that the county magistrate be informed for compliance." This order demonstrates the government's attention to police administration and its intention to maintain it. However, the salaries of the officers and police of the bureau have only been paid up to the first half of January of this year, and are in arrears for two and a half months. The salaries of the police officers are meager, making it difficult for them to sustain themselves for long. Even the officers are finding it difficult to manage during these times of hardship. Moreover, the food expenses for the general and branch bureaus, as well as the necessities for daily use, all require cash payments and cannot be delayed for long. According to reports from the Public Security Bureau Chief, as well as reports from the branch bureau chiefs and district chiefs, the long-term suspension of police salaries is a matter of great importance, and we request prompt allocation of funds to maintain the current situation. With the police force in dire straits, exhausting all means, the situation has become almost unbearable. The county magistrate, after reinvestigating, found that public security expenses are critical to the security of the entire county. At a time when bandits are not yet pacified and defense is important, patrols and arrests depend entirely on the police. If salaries cannot be paid monthly, it will be difficult to boost morale. Moreover, the county has a complex transportation network and its circumstances are different from other counties. The police officers are generally not well-educated, and in the event of an accident, a lack of discernment in command would be extremely dangerous. Yesterday, the county magistrate went to the countryside for inspection and personally witnessed the anxiety and fear of the police officers, all of whom looked distressed. All these difficulties are the true situation. However, lacking the ability to produce money from thin air, we feel we have exhausted all resources. As we are responsible for governing, we must speak out for the people. Under duress, we propose that your government, based on the resolution, promptly instruct the Department of Finance to quickly raise subsidies, or immediately order the county Finance Bureau to first pay the owed police salaries of over 9,800 yuan, and then allocate funds monthly. Once adequate funds for public security are raised, the subsidy will be stopped. Is this appropriate? We respectfully submit this document for your review and instruction. This is for the public good."</p>

<h3>Yang Qinxue Rescued Last Night</h3>
<p>Hidden in the Sheng Family Ancestral Hall</p>
<p>Because the Guard Was Out</p>
<p>Detectives Did Not Fire a Shot</p>
<p>The Car Has Also Been Found</p>
<p>Yang Xueqin, an elderly man from Nanxiang, was kidnapped by bandits on his way home from Yutai Soybean and Wheat Shop at around 7:30 p.m. the night before last, while passing through Xiao Jiu Hua Road in Nanshi. Details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Since the occurrence of this case, the Public Security Bureau has made every effort to investigate in order to solve the case as soon as possible. As the investigation progressed smoothly, Yang was successfully rescued safely from the Sheng Family Ancestral Hall at the end of Yidingpan Road at around 7:00 p.m. last night. Yang's family members were all overjoyed to see Yang return, smiling through their tears. The speed of solving this case this time is unprecedented. From the time of the incident to the time of rescue, only 24 hours passed, just one day and night.</p>
<p>Arrest of Kidnappers: After Yang Qinxue was kidnapped, Lu Yingzhi, the acting captain of the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, ordered Dong Mingde, the leader of the first district's detectives, to make every effort to investigate. Jin Dianyang, the director of the first district's third branch of the Public Security Bureau, also dispatched patrol officers Ren Jizhou and Shi Jiyan to jointly handle the case. The detectives began their work that night and arrested Li Ajin, Yang Qinxue's former rickshaw puller from Tongzhou. Li was hiding in Room 21 of the Yunzhou Hotel in Baoyu Lane, Xixinqiao, in the French Concession. Yesterday morning at around 7:00 a.m., detectives Yuan Haishan, Cai Ziqing, Ren Shouzhi, Yu Moulong, and Lü Anfu from the first district, together with detectives from the French Concession police station, went to arrest Li Ajin's concubine, Zhao Ganshi, and her eight-year-old child, Yun Di. After questioning, it was learned that the mastermind behind the kidnapping was the bandit Shen Guigui. Shen was hiding on the fourth floor of the Far Eastern Hotel, but his room number was unknown. Later, Shen Xiao A'bao was arrested at the original location and revealed that Shen Guigui lived in Room 421 of the Far Eastern Hotel. Detectives were immediately dispatched, along with detectives from the Public Concession police station. At 1:00 p.m., Shen Guigui went to the Yunzhou Hotel and was arrested. Later, Xu A'bao and Zhang A'sheng were arrested at the Far Eastern Hotel. Under strict interrogation, they revealed the location where the victim was being held. When arresting the aforementioned bandits, Lu Yingzhi dispatched detectives Gu Liancheng, Wang Peiwen, and Fu Zhengcai to assist.</p>
<p>Rescuing the Victim: The victim, Yang Qinxue, was being held by the bandits in the Sheng Family Ancestral Hall in Zhiyuanbin, at the end of Yidingpan Road. It is more than a mile from the end of Yidingpan Road to that location, a remote and desolate area. The Sheng Family Ancestral Hall is a five-courtyard complex, with over a hundred coffins. The victim was being held in the last courtyard, and the door was locked. The detectives broke down the door and entered. Yang was greatly startled at the sight and shouted for help from his bed. The detectives told him that they had come to rescue him, and he finally felt relieved. According to the guard, he had gone out to smoke at that time, so he was not prepared. Thus, Yang was rescued safely.</p>
<p>The Elderly Man Was Startled: Yang Qinxue is over sixty years old. After being kidnapped, he was quite startled. He had not eaten a single meal in a day and night. The guard prepared chicken cake for him, but the old man did not eat it. On the night he was kidnapped, Yang asked who the bandit leader was. The guard replied that his surname was Wang and said that Yang was the third victim, indicating that it was not the first time people had been held there. After the detectives entered the room, they did not encounter the guard, so there was no firing of guns or bullets. Instead, they found two pistols and some bullets left behind by the bandits under the bedding, which were taken to the bureau for safekeeping. The car rented from Weihai Automobile Company, No. 1483, was found on Difeng Road yesterday morning and was taken away by the car company.</p>
<h3>Famous Jockey Falls in Love with Lang Deshan's Daughter</h3>
<p>A Happy Family Suddenly Turns Tragic</p>
<p>Lang Deshan's Eldest Daughter, Mina,</p>
<p>Forms an Inextricable Bond with Hu Huilin</p>
<p>Hu Actually Abandons His Family and Goes Abroad</p>
<p>Recently Returned to Shanghai to Divorce His Wife</p>
<p>Hu Huilin, a 34-year-old from Zhejiang, is a famous jockey. Hu participates in every horse race held by the Chinese Jockey Club and the International Recreation Club, displaying his skills on the racetrack. His wife, Ms. Fang Wenxian, is the sister of the wealthy merchant Fang Jiaobo. Married for sixteen years, the couple had a deep love for each other. They have seven children, the eldest being fourteen years old and currently studying at the Nanyang Middle School Affiliated Primary School. The family was well-off and the family life was extremely harmonious. Unexpectedly, this happy family has recently been shrouded in tragic clouds. It turns out that Lang Deshan, a man from Shandong who made a name for himself in America for his magic tricks, came to Shanghai two years ago with his children and apprentices, performing at the Carlton Theater to great fanfare. Lang's two daughters, Mina and Bauldi, were not only highly skilled in the arts but also exceptionally beautiful. Every time they took the stage, their light songs and graceful dances were sure to captivate the audience. Hu and Lang were old friends, and when Lang performed in Shanghai, Hu made sure to be there to support him, going every day without fail. Hu had known the two girls since they were children, so he did not stand on ceremony and followed them all day long. It is estimated that Lang performed in Shanghai for six months, and Hu never missed a single day, especially attentive to his eldest daughter, Mina. As a result, the seeds of love gradually sprouted, and Mina vowed to follow him. Hu, of course, already had a wife, but he was trapped in a web of love and could not extricate himself. Fearing that his wife would be jealous, Hu abandoned his family last autumn and went abroad with Mina. For half a year, he did not send a single word to his wife. Hu is truly a heartless person. Unexpectedly, he suddenly returned to Shanghai and hired a lawyer named Wei to file a lawsuit in the Provisional Court, demanding a divorce from Ms. Fang Wenxian. After receiving the court summons yesterday, Ms. Fang lamented her misfortune, having been abandoned halfway through life. It is now heard that the case has been scheduled for trial on April 8 by the Special District Local Court.</p>
<h3>Suspended Car Falls</h3>
<p>A Worker Dies Tragically</p>
<p>A Pitiable Death at Work</p>
<p>A car belonging to the Xinzha Continental Car Company was damaged. The day before yesterday afternoon, the company's coppersmiths Sun A'gen, Sun A'er, Cha A'si, and Chen Jinsheng were working to repair it. The car was suspended in the air, and A'gen was working inside the suspended car. Unexpectedly, two of the copper wire ropes of the crane suddenly broke, and the car fell. A'gen was crushed by the car and seriously injured. Although he was immediately sent to Baolong Hospital, he died on the way. The police station in charge received the report and transported the body to the Fei Jianlun Road morgue. The deceased was only twenty-seven years old and still had his elderly father, Sun Xinquan, alive. He worked for the company with a monthly salary of twenty yuan. The company, considering that he died at work, agreed to give the bereaved family funeral expenses of three hundred yuan, as well as two years' salary of four hundred and eighty yuan. Yesterday afternoon, the Guo prosecutor, commissioned by the Special District Court, arrived at the scene to examine the body, instructed Sun Xinquan to sign a guarantee to claim the body for coffin burial, and ordered the company to provide a compassionate payment.</p>
<h3>Special District Counter-Revolutionary Cases to be Tried by the Higher Branch Court</h3>
<p>For counter-revolutionary cases, the initial trial is held at the High Court. However, if such cases occur within the Shanghai Special District, the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court will be the court of first instance. One such case was handled yesterday. Initially, the detectives sent the suspects to the Special District Local Court, but Judge Xu instructed them to be transferred to the Higher Branch Court for scheduled trial. The case originated with four revolutionaries apprehended by the Municipal Public Security Bureau on Baoshan Road in Zhabei. Based on their confessions, the organization was located at Room 110 of the Shenzhou Hotel, 733 Zhejiang Road, in the Public Concession. The Public Security Bureau dispatched detectives and requested assistance from the Shanghai Municipal Police. The Chief Inspector's Office sent Chinese and foreign detectives who secretly arrested thirteen accomplices at the address: Chen Mingzhang, Gu Zhaosheng, Ding Rongsheng, Chao Guangcai, Hu Yushu, Zhong Ziqing, Hua Hairong, Xu Heng, Yao Peijun, Yu Zhuming, Li Wenlai, and Li Chengzhong. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special District Local Court. Representatives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau brought documents to the court, requesting their transfer. Judge Xu, considering that the case should be investigated by the High Court, did not hand them over to the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday. The case now awaits investigation and handling by the Higher Branch Court. Currently, Chen Mingzhang and the other thirteen are temporarily detained at the Shanghai Municipal Police headquarters.</p>
<h3>Recommended Chinese Court Police</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of recommending judicial police officers for Chinese courts, Mr. Bailey, the British Consul, Mr. Yorkburg, the American Consul, and Mr. Xu Mo, the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have reached a solution through negotiation. The methods are as follows: (1) One police officer is recommended to be a Westerner, executing the duties outlined in Section 3 of the First Note within the agreement. Mr. Whitting is currently recommended for this position. (2) Four police sergeants, two Westerners and two Chinese, will serve as judicial police officers. Mr. Whitte and Mr. Mc Ding are currently recommended for the Western positions. (3) Six police officers, including two Russians and four Chinese. (4) Twenty-four constables. (5) The above numbers may be increased or decreased as necessary.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Strictly Prohibits the Adoption of Young Monks and Nuns</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government previously received instructions from the Executive Yuan that shaving the heads of young children violated human rights and hindered evolution. The previously promulgated regulations for the management of temples stipulated that minors should not be ordained as monks or Taoists, as a form of restriction. This matter is of great importance, and it is inappropriate to lift the ban. The government immediately ordered its subordinates to strictly investigate and prohibit such practices. Given the abundance of temples in the city, any violations of the prohibition of adoption should be strictly punished. The Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau have been instructed to investigate and prohibit these actions. Those who have already been ordained should be assisted through other means.</p>
<h3>Temporary Suspension of Daytime Electricity Supply in the Xujiahui Area</h3>
<p>Suspension for a total of three days starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Huashang Electric Company's power supply lines in the Xujiahui area require reorganization and expansion due to increased electricity demand. The company, in accordance with the reorganization plan of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, is adding transformers in the shed in front of the observatory and installing open-air transformers in the triangular area to re-divide the power reception area. Therefore, it is necessary to change the direction of the lines and, to reduce voltage loss, replace them with thicker wires. The company is scheduled to begin this work tomorrow. All daytime electricity supply to the Catholic Church and the triangular area will be suspended for three days from April 5th to 7th, daily from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM. This has already been approved by the Bureau of Public Utilities.</p>
<h3>Tibetan Lama Arrives in Shanghai En Route to Sichuan</h3>
<p>Lama Duo Shi from Tibet has been specially invited by the Buddhist Association in Chengdu, Sichuan, to lecture on Buddhism. The Living Buddha has already brought a large number of Buddhist statues and various scriptures from Beiping, packed in more than forty boxes. They have taken a sea route from Tianjin southward and will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. After arriving in Shanghai, they will transfer to a Yangtze River ship to enter Sichuan.</p>
<h3>Street Corner at Dongmen Road in the Nanshi Area</h3>
<p>Tram Tracks to be Connected</p>
<p>Fangbang Road and Jishui Road in this city were previously merged and reconstructed as Dongmen Road by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works. One end of this road, near Zhonghua Road, was originally where Chinese trams turned around. However, the area is crowded with vehicles and pedestrians, making it unsuitable for tram turnarounds. The Huashang Electric Company previously petitioned the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities to allow the tracks to be extended southward, connecting with the Sanlu Yuanlu (Third Road Roundabout), so that trams could pass directly through, reducing the inconvenience of stopping. However, to install the tracks, the road surface at the street corner must be widened by 95 centimeters. The Bureau, together with the Bureau of Public Works, submitted a request to the Municipal Government and instructed the company to use the land and compensate the owners for their expenses. The company has already submitted the compensation of 1,120 yuan to the Bureau of Finance and obtained a license from the Bureau of Public Works. Construction will begin soon to connect the tracks. From now on, the tracks in that area will be connected, further reducing obstacles to traffic.</p>
<h3>Puyi Real Estate Company Purchases the Original Site of the Maoye Bank</h3>
<p>Price: 600,000 Taels</p>
<p>The Da Wan Bao reports that the Nanjing Road site of the Zhonghua Maoye Bank has been purchased by Puyi Real Estate Company from the bank's liquidation office for 600,000 taels. However, it is not yet decided whether the company will retain it for its own use or resell it. According to Mr. Sandor, a director of the company, although stocks and the silver market are currently unfavorable, real estate is very popular. Several large real estate transactions were completed last month, and several others are currently under negotiation.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Approves Insurance Company</h3>
<p>To Handle Guarantees for the Bureau's Public Debt and Pension Savings</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council issued a notice stating that with regards to establishing a guarantee organization for public bonds, pensions, savings, etc., the Bureau has been continuously improving the plan. The Bureau's legal advisor also strongly supports this purpose. At the end of the year, the Accounting Director drafted a detailed report on the matter and submitted it to the Finance Committee for discussion. The committee members generally agreed that the best approach would be to negotiate with a company to act as guarantor for all public bonds, pensions, and savings. Recently, the Finance Committee held another meeting to discuss this issue, which was listed as one of the agenda items. The Accounting Director reported that he had consulted with representatives of the An-Píng Insurance Company, who were very willing to take on the responsibility. The Director had also requested the legal advisor to draft the necessary conditions. The committee members unanimously passed and approved the proposal to have the An-Píng Insurance Company handle the matter. The entire plan has now been approved by the Bureau.</p>
<h3>Notes on Children Contracting Measles</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department reports that measles is a highly prevalent infectious disease. There have been 11 deaths among Japanese and 83 deaths among Chinese. Measles is also a respiratory infectious disease, mainly transmitted by the germs from coughs, nasal discharge, and saliva. Although those who contract this disease tend to recover, it is very dangerous for children and they are more susceptible. 95% of those not cured are children, so it is essential to be very careful during the dangerous period of this disease. Those who contract measles have the disease dormant in their bodies for several days prior, and most do not pay attention before it breaks out. It generally starts as a cold. Here are the methods to protect children: (1) Prevent children from being close to or kissed by people with colds. (2) If a child feels feverish, has eye trouble, or has a stuffy nose, they must immediately rest in a room. (3) If a child has any of the above symptoms, they should not go to school or playgrounds or play with other children. (4) All towels, bedding, face cloths, etc., that have been soiled with the patient's saliva must be washed with boiling water and disinfected. If a child has measles, they should not be allowed to get out of bed until the fever has subsided and a doctor has approved it. Those who have measles have extremely low resistance and are easily infected with other diseases, such as pneumonia.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Shanghai Municipal Council Meeting</h3>
<p>Minutes of the Council Meeting on March 24th: (1) Renovation of Chinese Theaters: The Director of Public Works reported that three Chinese theaters in the concession have extremely poor construction and pose a serious danger to the lives of the audience in case of fire. The leases and license periods for these theaters are expiring this year, and it is proposed that licenses should no longer be issued. The attending directors strongly supported this proposal. A director then said that while this measure is appropriate, for the sake of public entertainment, abruptly closing three theaters might cause inconvenience. It would be appropriate to make some adjustments, perhaps retaining one or two theaters and extending their licenses for a period to allow for renovation. The Chairman put the matter to a vote and it was passed. (2) Trucks: Trucks in the concession often cause accidents due to overloading and speeding. Therefore, it is proposed that all types of trucks in the concession be reclassified and new regulations be established this year to limit their load and speed to prevent danger. This proposal was unanimously passed by the directors. (3) New Police Regulations: The Deputy Commissioner of Police presented the regulations for managing constables that had been approved by the Commissioner of Police. After discussion, the directors raised concerns about Article 6, which stipulated that if a constable violates regulations, a portion of their salary will be deducted during the suspension period. The General Manager stated that this measure seemed inconsistent with the law, as a person cannot be presumed guilty and have their due deducted before the case is clarified. The Deputy Commissioner of Police replied that this was not intended as punishment, but only a temporary withholding. If they are proven innocent, the salary will naturally be paid. This practice varies in different military and police units. A vote was taken to temporarily postpone the matter and continue to follow the old regulations. Later, when discussing the penalties in Article 4 of the regulations, a director felt that the treatment of Chinese constables and Indian constables was inconsistent. He questioned the Deputy Commissioner, who replied that this was due to custom. The Chinese considered minor offenses as serious, while the Indians considered them trivial. Conversely, the Indians considered minor offenses as serious, while the Chinese considered them trivial. Therefore, some distinctions had to be made. The director said that while this explanation had some merit, constables performing the same service and committing the same offense should be punished equally to ensure fairness. At this time, the Chairman stated that the director's reasoning was very sound. The article should be thoroughly explained by the Police Commissioner upon his return to Shanghai. If any modifications are necessary, they should be made. The remaining articles were immediately passed.</p>
<p>Minutes of the Council Meeting on March 18th: Construction of the Yangshupu Wharf: The Director of Public Works proposed the construction of the Yangshupu Wharf. The plan involves purchasing 76 mu, 1 fen, 6 li, and 9 hao of land along the Puxi River. The total cost, including land price, road construction, wharf construction, and equipment purchase, is estimated at 1,873,380 taels. However, in addition to the wharf, there will be over 50 mu of remaining land that can be resold, potentially offsetting some of the costs. In the future, goods can be loaded from Pudong and transported directly to the wharf for unloading. The wharf will be 679 feet long, three times longer than the 200-foot Huishan Wharf. The Accounting Director asked when the remaining 50 mu of land could be sold. The Director of Public Works replied that the remaining land could be sold immediately, but there is no need to rush the sale. Once the wharf is completed, the land price will increase, and they can obtain a fair price. This would be more advantageous. After discussion, the deadline for signing the land purchase agreement was set for March 23rd. A vote was taken to notify the directors who were not present.</p>

<p>Measures: (1) Allowances for Chinese Employees: Due to the increasing cost of living for Chinese employees of the Shanghai Municipal Council, allowances will be added to their salaries, ranging from 6% to 16%, starting from January 1st. This expenditure will increase by 110,000 taels annually. This proposal was unanimously passed. (2) Establishing More Chinese Schools: Three Chinese directors proposed establishing Chinese elementary schools in the eastern and western districts of the concession, with a budget of 50,000 to 200,000 taels per school. After discussion, it was agreed that the matter was related to important education and should be approved. However, the expenses cannot be increased threefold at once, and the Bureau is currently involved in various engineering projects, such as the construction of police stations, which are more urgent. This matter should be handled gradually. (3) Financial Report: The Accounting Director reported that the tax rate reduction of 2% would result in a shortfall of 600,000 taels in the Bureau's annual revenue. Last year's savings were 3,534,800 taels, mostly from interest on the sale of the electricity company. The Police Department's budget for this year has increased to 1,537,500 taels, a 43% increase compared to last year, due to the recruitment of a large number of new constables and staff.</p>
<h3>Reclassifying Trucks</h3>

<h3>Settlement of the Ding Runxiang Case Against the Russian</h3>
<p>Dismissal, Apology, Voluntary Departure from Shanghai, and Payment of Compensation</p>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly reported that Ding Runxiang from Chuansha was beaten and had his eye socket protruded by the Russian employee of Millerov. He was hospitalized at the Sino-Western Sanatorium for treatment. It is now learned that the matter has been settled. Ding Runxiang previously commissioned lawyer Qu Yue to send a letter to lawyer Tihibek stating: "In reply to your letter, Ding Runxiang claims that he was severely injured due to being beaten by Millerov in an abuse of power. He commissioned lawyer Tihibek to represent him and file a lawsuit. Later, to peacefully settle the matter, we negotiated with the legal authorities and finally reached the following agreement: (1) Millerov will be dismissed. (2) The perpetrator will apologize. (3) Millerov will voluntarily leave Shanghai. (4) The Council will provide compensation for the physical injury. Now that items 1, 2, and 4 have been completed, the perpetrator should be asked to leave Shanghai as soon as possible. Only after all the above conditions have been fulfilled will Runxiang request the withdrawal of the original case." Runxiang deeply desires to honor this commitment due to the lawyer's persuasion and the goodwill of the legal authorities. With items 1, 2, and 4 already verified by lawyer Tihibek's letter, he requests the immediate departure of the perpetrator from Shanghai, as the third item. Once fully implemented, Runxiang will file a request to withdraw the lawsuit. He expresses his gratitude for lawyer Tihibek's efforts and assistance and requests that he urge the fulfillment of the agreement. Otherwise, the matter will not be resolved. The letter requests your lawyer to please verify and urge the legal authorities to earnestly fulfill the third item, and then file a request to withdraw the lawsuit to comply with the original agreement. At the same time, letters with similar content were sent to Mr. Fairweather, the French Municipal Council's Chief of Police, and Mr. Jacques Meyrier de Lagrange, the French Consul General, expressing gratitude.</p>
<h3>The Bandit Shot Ten Times Dies; Autopsy Conducted Yesterday</h3>
<p>At 10:30 PM the previous evening, Chinese and Japanese constables from the Gordon Road Police Station encountered a bandit while patrolling between Xinzha Road and Carter Road. They exchanged fire and killed the bandit, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that two Chinese and two Japanese constables surrounded the bandit. Because the bandit refused to surrender and instead opened fire to resist arrest, the constables fired in self-defense. The police fired a total of eleven shots, all of which hit their target. The bandit was shot ten times, but still fled with his injuries. Eventually, he collapsed and died on the road due to his fatal wounds. The police took the bandit's pistol back to the police station. The police chief ordered that the bandit's body be taken to the forensic examination office on Faelun Road. Yesterday afternoon, District Court prosecutor Guo arrived at the office to verify the bandit's death. The coroner questioned the constables regarding the circumstances of the event. Since the deceased had no known relatives, the prosecutor ordered the Pu Shan Mountain Villa to claim the body for burial. Because the bandit was killed on the spot, his name could not be ascertained.</p>
<h3>Gang Leader who Shot a Constable was brought to Trial Yesterday</h3>
<p>On the evening of March 31st, the Chinese constable number 462 from the Gordon Road Police Station went to arrest armed gang members who robbed the Wang family on Changping Road in western Shanghai. He was shot and killed by a bandit. On a previous day, the police station discovered that the bandit was hiding in the Xiangfeng Jiangbei Theater on Men-an Road in Zhabei. At 6:00 PM, detectives were dispatched to the theater, where they arrested Wang Xiao Guozi, a man from Jiangbei, along with detectives from the police station. Three more suspects were subsequently apprehended on Guangzhao Road. Apart from Wang, who was immediately taken back to the police station for detention, the other three were temporarily held at the Second Branch of the Fourth District. Yesterday morning, Wang was taken to the Special District Local Court for questioning by Judge Sun Yuan. The first witness, Yang Fuhai, testified that he was watching a play at the theater on the previous day when Wang Xiao Guozi sat next to him. He overheard Wang whispering to the person sitting next to him about the robbery on Changping Road and the shooting of the constable, saying that he would flee to another location. The person next to him, said that they lived in the Chinese area. He immediately ran to the police station to report. Detectives were dispatched to the theater and the defendant was apprehended. According to Wang Xiao Guozi, the plan to rob the house was instigated by the Liu, of the other three suspects, who he claimed was also being held by the Public Security Bureau. He claims he was guarding the door of the victim's house and received ten yuan afterwards. The gang leader claimed to be unaware of the constable's death. The police station lawyer, Ru Baoyi, requested a postponement and the transfer of the other three suspects to be tried together. Judge Sun ordered the defendant to be detained pending further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Two Pharmaceutical Workers Detained</h3>
<p>For Gathering Crowds to Go to the Hu Qing Yu Tang Pharmacy</p>
<p>Tried by the Special District Local Court Yesterday</p>
<p>The labor strike among pharmaceutical workers in this city, despite repeated mediation by party and government agencies, has not been fully resolved. At 2:30 PM on the previous day, over 800 workers, some carrying bags of lime, gathered to go to the Hu Qing Yu Tang Pharmacy on Beijing Road. The police at the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road had already taken notice. When they arrived at the pharmacy, the Chinese and Western police protecting the pharmacy, fearing that they would be pushed into the store and cause trouble, immediately stopped them and politely advised them to disperse. However, the workers did not retreat. The Chinese and Western police had no choice but to use batons to disperse them and arrest the ringleaders, Wu Yulin from Haimen and Lin Mingfu from Ningbo, seizing several bags of lime. The rest scattered. Yesterday morning, the Lao Zha Police Station sent Wu and Lin, along with the bags of lime, to the Special District Local Court for questioning by Judge Xu Jiashi in the First Tribunal. Chief Prosecutor Zhou Xianjue was also present. First, the police station lawyer stated the details of the case and presented the bags of lime as evidence. Then, Western constable number 309 reported the circumstances of the event, saying that he was ordered by the police chief to be stationed at the Hu Qing Yu Tang Pharmacy on Beijing Road. At around 2:00 PM the previous day, Wu Yulin led a crowd to the pharmacy. Lin Mingfu had already arrived alone near the pharmacy. Wu spoke to him and attempted to push their way into the pharmacy. He advised the crowd to disperse twice, but they did not comply and shouted to fight. Therefore, he arrested Wu and Lin as the ringleaders. Judge Xu questioned Wu Yulin, who claimed that he was working in a pharmacy on Xian Gua Street in the southern district. After the pharmaceutical workers went on strike, the labor side appealed to all parties. Later, they received an order from the Municipal Government to resume work and an order from the company to prioritize hiring unemployed workers. However, the company did not comply with the official advice. The labor side requested the Central Government to order the workers to resume work and to order the company to accommodate the unemployed. Hu Qing Yu Tang is a giant among Shanghai pharmacies, making hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. Now, they have not prioritized hiring unemployed workers, violating the mediation of the party and government agencies. On the previous day, the labor union announced that a meeting would be held at 9:00 AM yesterday to discuss the accommodation of unemployed workers. The city party headquarters dispatched instructor Lin to attend and guide the meeting. At around 2:00 PM yesterday, they gathered 700 to 800 workers and planned to go to the Hu Qing Yu Tang Pharmacy to persuade the workers to attend the meeting. The bags of lime belonged to me. Lin claimed that he worked at the labor union and was ordered by the union to persuade the Hu Qing Yu Tang workers to attend the meeting. Judge Xu ordered that the two defendants be detained pending further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3>The Leprosy Society Continues to Operate the Hongkou Commune</h3>
<p>Good News for Patients</p>
<p>The "Hongkou Commune" at the intersection of Linping Road and Yucai Road in Hongkou was founded by Dr. Xie Boli, an American female doctor. It is the only social service organization in the area. The commune is surrounded by factories and is a gathering place for coolies and common people. The clinics for diagnosis and treatment and the children's clinic established by the commune benefit the poor people immensely. Since its establishment, the results have been remarkable. In March of this year, Dr. Xie passed away due to illness, and there was a lack of a person to manage it. The work of the commune was in danger of being suspended. Dr. Diao Xinde, a famous doctor in Shanghai, and the wife of Dr. Badesheng, the director of the Shandong Road Dehe Hospital, were good friends of Dr. Xie and enthusiastically supported the commune. They could not bear to see the closure of the commune and discussed with the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association to find a way to continue it. The association had a leprosy clinic in Xiangyanqiao, but the site was small and insufficient. There was a previous proposal to expand it. Therefore, the Executive Committee of the association convened an ad hoc meeting at Dr. Diao's residence last night, chaired by Li Yuanxin, and decided that the "Hongkou Commune" would be continued by the association. A clinic committee was formed, with Diao Xinde, Gu Enkang, doctors Xiao Zhiji and Zheng Yangxiu, wives of Dr. Badesheng, Zhang Jiafu, Xi, Zhu, Hu, and other nine people as standing committee members. The monthly operating cost is 200 yuan, which will be raised by the Leprosy Relief Association and the committee. The area is a leprosy epidemic area in Shanghai. Patients from the leprosy departments of Tongren Hospital and Renji Hospital originally came from the area. Now, there is no need to travel far and they can go directly to the association for treatment.</p>
<h3>Shen Guozuo Sues His Paternal Uncle for Seizing Inheritance</h3>
<p>Shen Guozuo, a resident of this county, recently retained lawyer Wang Fuchang to file a lawsuit in the local court against his paternal uncle, Shen Xinqi, also implicating Yang Heqing, for seizing inheritance. He seeks a judgment ordering the return of the inheritance. The petition states that the plaintiff, Shen Guozuo, is 25 years old and a Shanghai native, residing at Xue Lu, No. 8 Huiguan Street, Laiyi Wharf, Nanshi. The plaintiff had a paternal uncle, Shen Yangguo (also known as Shen Xiande), who had no descendants. His wife, Qin, remarried Yang Zhou, who was the biological elder brother of the defendant, Shen Xinqi (the first defendant).</p>
<p>According to records, Yang Zhou and the plaintiff's deceased father, Mingde, divided the family property in the nineteenth year of the Guangxu reign (of the Qing Dynasty), and a written agreement was made. This agreement stated that the two-section house would be divided, with the front section going to Mingde and the rear section going to Xiande. Additionally, 63 mu of land would be divided equally into two shares, after deducting 10 mu for Sister Suzhen. My mother and Elder Sister Yin jointly received one share, and the two brothers shared the remaining two shares. The agreement also stated that Uncle Ziqing had borrowed 4,000 taels of silver, half of which belonged to each brother. After Yang Zhou's death, all his inheritance was taken by Qin to the home of the first defendant, Shen Xinqi, who has been occupying it ever since. Qin has now passed away, and it is said that the first defendant has secretly sold the house to the former tenant, the second defendant, Yang Heqing. Of the Qingpu land, 13 mu remain, and the first defendant is collecting rent for his own use. The first defendant, as Yang Zhou's younger brother, not only took his wife but also seized his inheritance. Therefore, the plaintiff requests that the court order the return of all the assets. The defendants, Shen Xinqi and Yang Heqing, also retained lawyer Wen Chao to present their defense. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Keqian opened the court to hear the case. Neither of the defendants was present, with only lawyer Wen Chao appearing on their behalf. The plaintiff, Shen Guozuo, stated the above information. (Question) How many brothers did your father have? (Answer) Two, my late father and Yang Zhou. (Question) When did Yang Zhou die? (Answer) It has been 35 years since his death. (Question) When did your father die? (Answer) He died of illness on April 2nd of the 15th year of the Republic (1926). (Question) Did Yang Zhou have any children? (Answer) No, so my cousin Shen Pengfei was adopted as Yang Zhou's heir, around the 10th year of the Republic (1921). Shortly after, Shen Pengfei, his mother Tang, and Yang Zhou's wife, Qin, were involved in a lawsuit, and the adoption was revoked. (Question) Who should inherit Yang Zhou's estate now? (Answer) On March 1st of this year, the family council decided that the plaintiff should inherit. (Question) Why are you suing Yang Heqing? (Answer) Yang Heqing knew that there would be disputes over the mortgage of this house, so I am requesting that the mortgage be declared invalid. The defendant's lawyer, Wen, stated that the two defendants were unable to attend due to other matters. He provided information on their ages and origins: The first defendant, Shen Xinqi, is 53 years old, a Shanghai native, residing at Huafeng Leather Goods Company, No. 352 Fangbang Road. The second defendant, Yang Heqing, is 52 years old, from Cixi, residing at No. 162 Laiyi Wharf. The main points of their defense are that the Qingpu land had already been mortgaged by the deceased Shen Qin during her lifetime. As for the 2,000 taels borrowed, it was related to a brotherly dispute between the defendant's father and the plaintiff's grandfather. Regarding the mortgage of the house, it was rented to Yang Heqing in the eighth year of the Republic (1919) and mortgaged in the fifteenth year (1926). Qin died in May of the thirteenth year (1924). They are followers of Islam. The judge asked, "Was she taken as a wife by her husband's brother?" (Answer) Yes. He also stated that the first defendant's son should be the heir of Yang Zhou, which would be legal because the plaintiff's father was an adopted son. The family council was therefore illegal, and the first defendant has already filed a lawsuit in this court, requesting a declaration that the inheritance is invalid. The judge ordered witness Shen Yingxian to testify. Shen Yingxian is 43 years old, residing at No. 32 Xinxian Lane, Hujun Camp, and works at the Qiuxin Factory. The plaintiff and defendant are both my cousins, but the defendant is more distant. (Question) Who is the clan leader? (Answer) I am the clan leader. (Question) Do you know Shen Yangzhou? (Answer) I was very young back then. Yangzhou died many years ago. Mingde was the elder brother, and Yangzhou was the younger brother. However, Mingde was adopted, not a biological son. (Question) After Yangzhou's death, was an heir adopted and then the adoption revoked? (Answer) Yes. (Question) How many people attended your family council? (Answer) More than ten people. (Question) What was the result? (Answer) The result of the meeting was that the plaintiff should inherit Yangzhou's estate because the plaintiff has an elder brother, while the defendant only has one son, etc. Another witness, Shen Shaogang, testified. Shen Shaogang is 71 years old, a Shanghai native, residing at No. 727 Tiantong Road. The plaintiff is my nephew. Although I am surnamed Shen, we are not of the same lineage. The plaintiff is my sister's son. (Question) Why has this issue of inheritance only arisen now, leading to a family council? (Answer) This time, because of a joyous event in the plaintiff's family, most of the relatives began to negotiate, and that is why the meeting took place. The plaintiff's father was adopted. At this point, the judge said to the defendant's lawyer, "The defendant has filed a separate lawsuit in this court regarding the plaintiff's illegal inheritance. For the sake of convenience, we will consolidate it with this case for trial." The defendant's lawyer agreed. The judge adjourned the court, saying that the witnesses were not all present and that a debate would be held at a later date.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Assault on North Chengdu Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday at around 1:00 PM, at the Yiyuan Rubber Factory, No. 1058 North Chengdu Road, after wages had been paid out, suddenly four or five men in short clothes, brandishing pistols and "box cannons," forced the doorman of the factory to lead them to the accounting room. It so happened that a merchant from Guangdong, Wang Zuoping, 55 years old (staying at Mengyuan Hotel, No. 78, had arrived last week), was sitting alone in the room, relaxing. The robbers mistook him for the boss and threatened him, demanding that he hand over the keys. Wang, being of advanced age, trembled in fear at the sight of the weapons pointed at his chest, unable to speak coherently. The robbers thought Wang was deliberately being cunning and fired two shots, one of which hit Wang's left knee, causing him to bleed profusely. The robbers then stole dozens of silver dollars from the counter and fled.</p>
<h3>Burning of Counterfeit Currency</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, Yuan Liang, the director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Police Bureau, ordered the burning of all counterfeit currency of the Putian Bank (various denominations of 5 and 10 yuan) and various models seized in cases, within the bureau's premises.</p>
<h3>Male and Female Passengers Arrested for Carrying Opium</h3>
<p>At the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, around 9:00 AM yesterday, as the No. 6 train to Hangzhou was being prepared at the South Station, a passenger, about 40 years old, went to the back door of the station. He was inspected by the patrol officers of the No. 2 District Police Station of the station road, and a bag of opium paste, weighing two ounces, was found on his person. The passenger's name is said to be Wang Shengrong, 44 years old, from Songjiang. Also, around 5:30 PM, a female passenger came to the station to buy a ticket to Jiaxing. Chen Bi, a female inspector dispatched by the Municipal Public Security Bureau to the South Station, found her suspicious, approached and inspected her. Thirty-one pieces of opium paste were found on her person. Both the suspect and the evidence were sent to the No. 2 District Headquarters of Ximen for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Regarding Painting of Buddha Images</h3>
<p>Problem of Selling Fake Bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Qian Huafu of Biling is known for his Buddha paintings. Recently, Mr. Qian discovered that a large stationery store on Nanjing Road was using his name to sell counterfeit paintings. He attempted to reason with them, but they ignored him. Mr. Qian has invoices and conclusive evidence, so he has entrusted lawyers Yuan Xilian and Tong Kechang to file a lawsuit.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Regarding Dissolution of Partnership in Riding School</h3>
<p>A Westerner named Ding Arnault, represented by a lawyer, filed a lawsuit in the French Court, stating that the plaintiff had previously partnered with Gutvut, Lai Arnault, and Su Wulov to open a riding school. At the time, the plaintiff invested seven shares, each worth 100 yuan, totaling 700 yuan. He also worked at the school. Article 10 of the share agreement stated that if any shareholder did not wish to work at the school and left, they could sell their shares. If there were no buyers, the school would be dissolved, and the proceeds would be distributed proportionally. Now, the plaintiff no longer wishes to work at the school and wants to leave Shanghai. He demanded that the defendants return his share money. The defendants replied in a letter, stating that each share was only worth a little over 60 yuan. Therefore, the plaintiff denied this and filed a lawsuit, requesting a swift recovery of the money. The defendants requested a postponement to allow them to retain a lawyer to respond. The judge granted the request and postponed the hearing.</p>
<h3>Dismissal of Lawsuit for Loss of Partnership</h3>
<p>A Westerner named Leinan, represented by a lawyer, filed a lawsuit in the French Court yesterday, stating that the plaintiff used to be a pharmacist in Harbin. Last year, the owner of a Western medicine store in Shanghai, Liao Sinauf, hired him to work in Shanghai, stating that his monthly salary would be 125 yuan, and 25 yuan would be deducted from his salary each month as a security deposit. Unexpectedly, after only six months, the defendant terminated the plaintiff's employment without cause. Therefore, the plaintiff suffered a total loss of 1,185 yuan, which he requests to be swiftly recovered. The defendant, also represented by a lawyer, argued that the plaintiff was introduced to the defendant's store by a German named Ge Luosi. There was no contract between the two parties. The defendant had notified the plaintiff two months prior to cease operations, which was not unreasonable. He presented the plaintiff's monthly salary slips as evidence, proving that he had received his salary in full and that no 25 yuan had been deducted. The claim is without merit and should be dismissed. Witness Ge Luosi stated that the plaintiff had asked him to introduce him to a business, so he introduced him to the defendant's store to work. He was not hired to come to Shanghai, and no contract was signed. The presiding judge ruled that since there was no contract between the two parties, the plaintiff's claim was without merit and should be dismissed immediately. The plaintiff shall bear the court costs.</p>

After about half an hour, the fire was extinguished. In addition to the complete destruction of the woman's house, the fire also spread to three households in a combined building, including Zhu Qingyun, a local resident at No. 39, Shen Xiaodi, a resident of Suzhou, and Wang Ligui, a resident of Zhenjiang.

<p>Zhu Qingzhang, a 17-year-old apprentice from Zhenhai Township, Zhejiang Province, at Changhe Pig Brokerage in Peide Lane, 16th Pupu, Nanshi, Shanghai, was performing his duties diligently.

<p>Correction: In the report on the 2nd (the day before yesterday), the French police special agency discovered a kidnapping den at 356 Rue du Père Robert and rescued the hostage Yan Ruling. The second kidnapper mentioned, Zhou Bingcheng, is actually an agent of the French police special agency. Due to a hasty recording of the manuscript, Zhou's name was mistakenly written as a bandit. We sincerely correct this and apologize to Mr. Zhou.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Child: Mother, does this microscope magnify everything we look at?</p>
<p>Mother: Yes, it magnifies many times.</p>
<p>Child: Mother, then when you cut open that chicken cake to share with me and my brother later, please don't use this microscope.</p>
<p>Painter: I have finished your portrait. Take a look at it yourself. Are you satisfied?</p>
<p>Customer: It's not bad, but I don't like that part of the nose.</p>
<p>Painter: I don't like it either, but it's your nose.</p>
<p>A: Old Bing truly loves his fiancée. He can't wait to kneel down and worship her as soon as he sees her.</p>
<p>B: That's not surprising. After they get married, I'm afraid he'll have to kneel down and worship her day and night.</p>
<p>Husband: Someone came to be a matchmaker today. He said he has a friend who is looking for a suitable partner. We might as well choose one of our six daughters.</p>
<p>Wife: What kind of business is this person in?</p>
<p>Husband: I heard he's a wine merchant.</p>
<p>Wife: A wine merchant? The older the wine, the better. He must choose old wine that has been around for many years to sell. Then let's match our eldest daughter with him.</p>
<h3>Chang Yuchun's Socks</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yan</p>
<p>Among the famous generals of the Ming Dynasty, Xu Da and Chang Yuchun are highly regarded. Da is gentle and kind, with the demeanor of a scholar. To this day, his descendants are numerous. Chang Yuchun, known for his love of killing, has few descendants. The Xiejiabridge in Yangzhou is the historical site where Chang Yuchun was enfeoffed as a prince. And Changfu Lane in Xiaodongmen is also the site of Chang Yuchun's mansion. By the mid-Qing Dynasty, the Chang family had declined and moved to Huang Yuqiao in the northern countryside of Yangzhou. My tenant, Chang Guotai, is a descendant of Lord Chang Yuchun. Lord Chang's portrait still exists. I once had a look at it. He appears tall and strong, with a long, dark face, slender eyebrows, and large, round eyes. His beard is more than a foot long, and his ears are almost three inches long. He wears a golden helmet and a large red, gold-embroidered python robe. He looks so lifelike that he inspires fear. The most valuable thing is that the tenant's family still has a silk sock of Lord Chang Yuchun. It is made of yellow satin and embroidered with gold flowers. The sock is almost three feet long, and the circumference of the sole is about one foot seven or eight inches, with a width of eight inches. With such a large sock, one can imagine how strong and tall his body must have been. It is said that the sock can hold a斗 of rice. Truly a giant foot. Guotai takes it out to dry every summer. To this day, it is still carefully preserved and treasured.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Trial Use of Steam Automobiles</h3>
<p>— Lan Xi</p>
<p>On the morning of March 31st, after the commemorative week ceremony was completed, we returned to our respective rooms to work. At 9:45, the friendly Yu CS came to our office and said, "The Shanghai-Songjiang branch line is testing the steam automobile today. If you have free time, you may want to take a ride." There were about twenty people in our office. Except for three who did not join, everyone else enthusiastically participated. There were already two to three hundred people signing up at the station. There were also many Chinese and foreign guests, news reporters from various newspapers, representatives from the Post Office, representatives from the Naval Command, etc. Road staff included Commander Liu, Advisor Luo, and Director Liu. It was very lively.</p>
<p>We got on the car and found the various facilities to be exceptionally comfortable. The first-class seats were especially novel. The rattan backrests could be moved back and forth, so there was no need to travel backwards. Each car had two seats (third class). Each seat could accommodate 150 people. There were no second-class cars. Like streetcars, there were only first and third classes. Before April 1st, the new cars were not in use. Only twenty-two trips were made each day. Now the number has increased to seventy-four. How convenient is that?</p>
<p>The car started at 10 o'clock. It moved very smoothly, without the discomfort of bumps. Everyone's faces were full of smiles. The atmosphere was completely new, symbolizing much hope.</p>
<p>This time it was a special express train. It did not stop at any of the stations along the way. Pedestrians along the road happily told each other, "That's the steam automobile. How interesting." The children were especially happy, jumping and cheering wildly in the meadows by the stream. We all laughed.</p>
<p>Along the way, the peach blossoms were red and the willows were green. Spring was back in the world. The sound of water and the sound of the machine sang together. The sound of human voices and the sound of birds intertwined. After thirty minutes of travel, Baotaiwan arrived.</p>
<p>Three hundred people got off the car together. Commander Liu, Advisor Luo, and Director Liu, accompanied by several foreign guests, led the way to the reception room by the Wusong River. The air there was fresh, and one's mind felt refreshed. Small sails dotted the river, and the white water stretched endlessly. The author stared blankly for a while, then followed the crowd into the seating area to enjoy tea and snacks. The order was orderly and very solemn.</p>
<p>After Commander Liu read the Prime Minister's will, he reported on the process of purchasing steam automobiles and his hopes for improving the various lines (Shanghai-Songjiang branch line). The audience applauded. Even the ten or so blue-eyed people in the seats did not know what he was talking about, but they still applauded as usual.</p>
<p>Later, reporters from various newspapers gave speeches, and representatives and guests gave speeches. After the tea and snacks, everyone took a photo in front of the new car at the station to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<h3>Recording New Scams</h3>
<p>— Qing Shi Jushi</p>
<p>Passengers come and go, and it's hard to tell who's good and who's bad. In the last month of the lunar year, I was returning to my hometown from my uncle's house in Nanqiao. As usual, I took a rowboat, which was fashionable at the time. The cabin was empty, so I found a clean spot, squatted down, leaned against the side of the boat, and took out a pocket novel to break the loneliness. A good plan, I thought. At that time, the boatman was loading cargo, like Han Xin commanding troops, the more the better. And the passengers on the boat, some like merchants, some like vendors, followed one after another, shoulder to shoulder. When the loading was complete, the boat set sail. The passengers also began to talk and laugh, and their discussions were lively, creating a joyful atmosphere. But little did they know that the dark curtain of a scam was being set up in the midst of all this laughter.</p>
<p>Carefully observe to know the bad guys: A passenger sitting to my right, speaking in the Pudong dialect, was making advances to a passenger sitting across from him, asking in detail about his name and where he lived. The one speaking in the Pudong dialect was Zhang Sanbao, and the passenger across from him was named Wang Changshi, who worked at a cigarette shop in Pinghu. He said that because the end of the year was near, he had come here to settle accounts with customers. Now he was conveniently going to Songjiang to settle accounts with a cigarette paper business so that he could report back to Pinghu. Upon hearing this, Zhang quickly circled and sat down, eagerly inquiring about everything. He stared at Wang's luggage, thinking that it must contain a lot of silver and gold, and he couldn't wait to grab it and run away. At this time, I closed my book and straightened my clothes, concentrating on observing them. Seeing that his eyes were as sharp as a thief's, I immediately concluded that he was not a good person. But Wang was still in a fog, becoming even more intimate. They offered each other cigarettes and fruit, giving and taking like close friends. I pondered, why would two people who had never met before be so friendly? There must be something unbelievable going on.</p>
<p>The goal is achieved, and the person disappears: After a while, the boat arrived at Yeshe Town and stopped. Zhang invited Wang to a restaurant for a drink. Wang did not refuse and went ashore with him. I also leisurely walked into the restaurant and sat alone. The two of them ordered drinks and then competed to be the host. Zhang had already taken the lead and said to Wang, "This little bit is not worth mentioning." Wang then placed his small leather bag on the table so that he could continue to socialize. In an instant, Zhang used the excuse of going to the toilet, briskly walked downstairs, and Wang did not pay attention. After sipping his tea and looking back, he suddenly disappeared. Wang asked the waiter, who said that apart from the three of them, there were no other customers. How could someone disappear without a trace? Wang then realized that the man was a robber. The reason why he was so attentive was that he saw that Wang's luggage was very rich and had long been coveting it. He took advantage of this opportunity to strike, using an excuse to leave first. At this time, the boatman could not wait any longer and set sail for Songjiang. Wang had no choice but to board the boat in a panic. He said that the bag contained 84 silver dollars and 15 cents. And the money he spent on wine was only a little over 1.6 dollars. I smiled and replied, "He didn't know you before, but he acted like an old friend. His purpose was definitely different. As an observer, I knew that he had great desires. You were too careless and didn't realize it. If you had been a little more careful, he would not have been able to act. Your drinking with him can be considered a small loss, but he exchanged his small expense of 1 dollar and some change for a bag of folding money. It was like using a golden snail to catch a jade crab." Wang could only say yes.</p>
<h3>Recording the Hidden Box in the Buddha Shrine</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>There are two people in Shanghai who collect matchbox covers: Xu Zhuodai and Qian Huofo. Huofo has spent more than ten years of effort, and his collection is particularly rich. He glues them to paper clips, like album pages, with thousands of species. Most of them are from Japan. The matchbox covers have beautiful patterns, either landscapes, still lifes, flowers and birds, or human silhouettes. The colors are elegant and refined. There are also Sunday tables for easy checking, and golden, glittering labels for the Grand Ceremony, Banzai, and other characters for temporary celebrations, just like the commemorative stamps of the post office. Most of the brands are for cafeterias and restaurants. Other banks, kimono shops, and news agencies are also embellished. Japanese people spare no effort in advertising. Every store must have specially made matches, using the matchbox cover as an advertisement to give to customers. The effect is better than ordinary leaflets. At this point, Huofo took out a brocade box, about an inch high and six or seven inches wide, with the roots dyed with gold, like a small volume. When the box was opened, it contained exquisite matchboxes. I couldn't help but laugh. Swiss and English matchboxes are wider, printed with images of great men, inspiring respect. The ones produced in our country, such as ingots, pagodas, double coins, and bats, have vulgar and rigid patterns, with no aesthetic sense, which is depressing to look at. I sincerely hope that our country's match merchants will improve them and reach a state of true beauty and goodness. Huofo also showed me the strangest celebrity business cards he had collected. There was one of a Mongolian with more than ten characters in his name, cumbersome and difficult to remember. Du Dingyou, a librarian, had a business card as white as a flawless piece of jade, with only the three small characters "Du Dingyou" engraved in the left corner. Although it may not be entirely romantic, it has its own charm and is very convenient for writing notes. It is an excellent method. Someone's business card was handwritten by Sun Yat-sen, with an attached explanation, which was very creative. Wang Zhongsheng, a pioneer of new drama, had a Western-style photo printed on his card, with a very graceful demeanor. Zhongsheng's other name, Xi Pu, shed blood for the revolution and was truly a commendable martyr. On that day, the famous actress Jin Biyan was also present. They laughed and chatted while viewing the collection for a long time.</p>
<h3>A Record of Walking to Beijing (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Liu Hanru, Member of the National Walking Team</p>
<p>Our team departed from Shanghai on February 20th and arrived in the capital in four weeks. The first step of our plan has come to a small conclusion. We have received many inquiries from people in Shanghai who care about our team. We cannot answer them one by one. So we are using the Free Talk section to provide a brief report. Due to space limitations, we cannot provide all the details. We hope you understand.</p>
<p>On the morning of February 20th, we gathered at the North Station Grand Hotel. Our luggage was very simple. Each person had a backpack, a blanket, a lunch box, and a water bottle. The rest were cameras and other instruments. At 8:30 AM, the well-wishers and public groups all arrived. Their enthusiasm for our team's was overflowing. This was truly touching. At 8:30 AM, we shook hands with the gentlemen and bid farewell. We proceeded along the railway. At 10:25 AM, we arrived at Zhenru. The faculty and staff of the Dadong Special School welcomed us and provided tea and snacks. We listened to the teachings of Mr. Shen Rugui and Mr. Tong Hou. They accompanied us to Yangjiaqiao before returning. Their deep affection was greatly appreciated. That night, we stayed at the Nanhui Township Office. The next morning at 6:00 AM, we set off along the river to Jiading. We arrived at the county seat at around 10:00 AM. Director Lu of the Public Education Center led us to various places to visit. In the evening, Director Yang of the Education Bureau hosted a banquet to welcome us. On the morning of the 22nd, we left Jiading for Taicang. Because each person was carrying too much weight on their shoulders, averaging more than 30 pounds per person, we hired a wheelbarrow to push everyone's backpacks. This made walking much easier. We arrived in Taicang City at around 12:00 PM. Members of the County Chamber of Commerce sent people to welcome us and accommodated us at the New Inn. In the evening, the County Party Department also held a tea party to welcome us. On the morning of the 23rd, we planned to go to Kunshan. We asked the villagers how to get to Kunshan. Some answered that there was no road to take, while others said that only small roads were passable. We had already entrusted our backpacks to be taken to the Kunshan Telephone Bureau in advance. We had no choice but to walk out of the west gate. About five miles outside the city, there was a new village of Guangdong people called Zhendong. It meant "revitalize Guangdong" and was a villa for overseas Chinese who had returned from the Americas. The village was full of Guangdong people. Because the team leader, Mr. Xie, was from Guangdong, he requested a visit, which was readily granted. We were also invited to lunch. We said goodbye at 2:00 PM. On the way, we walked along the rice paddy ridges. There was really no main road to take. We arrived in Kunshan City at 5:00 PM. We stayed in Kunshan for a day. In addition to visiting the various agencies, we also visited Ma'an Mountain, the Gui Tomb, and the Township Ancestral Hall. On the 25th, we took the railway to Suzhou. We departed from the station at 8:30 AM and arrived in Suzhou at 6:00 PM in the evening. Because team member Mr. Liang was a student at the Provincial Agricultural College, we stayed at the school. We rested for two days, organized the records from the past few days, and visited Tiger Hill, Hanshan Temple, Canglang Pavilion, and Liuyuan.</p>
<h3>Eastward Travel Correspondence (2)</h3>
<p>— Wu Xiaohou</p>
<p>B. Social Education: Nagasaki Social Education. There are two famous libraries, as well as museums, parks, etc. Among the two libraries, the Nagasaki Prefectural Library is known for having the most perfect facilities. When the reporter arrived at the library, Director Tokihide Nagayama happened to be out on official business. The head of the administrative department, Renkichi Masuda, came out to greet [the reporter]. The entire library is divided into three main sections: (1) Reading rooms, offices, dormitories, etc., which are wooden, two-story buildings, occupying more than 300 acres. Inside are ordinary reading rooms, special reading rooms, women's reading rooms, newspaper reading rooms, children's reading rooms, historical materials exhibition rooms, dining halls, the director's office, administrative offices, dormitory rooms, etc. (2) A library building, which is built of reinforced concrete, a three-story building, occupying 30 ping. (3) A bookbinding room, storage room, servants' room (i.e., servants' quarters), etc., which are wooden, single-story buildings, occupying 53 ping. In addition to the above three main sections, there are also remaining houses, open spaces, etc., totaling 1,149 ping. The library holds more than 60,000 volumes of books, with an annual budget of more than 20,000 yuan. There are 25 staff members in total. The library has a special private collection room, which contains five volumes of Holy Scriptures, dating back to 300 years ago, in 1607 AD. They are extremely valued. There is also a portrait of the German Heber, inquired to be a German naval officer, who was the first to teach foreign languages after Japan opened its country. The Japanese people placed his statue in the Nagasaki Library, the first port of entry, also to commemorate his previous labor, with the intention of preserving his memory forever.</p>
<p>Nagasaki's environment is all mountains. The park is built against the mountains, ascending in tiers, with excellent scenery. However, Nagasaki is one of Japan's fortresses, and photography is prohibited, which is a great pity. Fortunately, I was able to obtain a picture of the entire Nagasaki Prefectural Library, which is reproduced in this newspaper. The city streets are neat and clean, and the flowers and trees are lush, which gives a glimpse of the scenery of Nagasaki.</p>
<p>Since Nagasaki is the first port of entry from China to Japan, many Chinese people reside there, mostly for business, followed by industry, and occasionally there are monks. The reporter went to the Dongmen Temple in the port and saw a memorial stone tablet for Mr. Su Daosheng, the former chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of the late Qing Dynasty. The temple monks rubbed the inscription on the tablet and gave it to visitors as one of the historical sites. He also went to Chongfu Temple and learned that the temple was built more than 300 years ago by the monk Jifei through donations. Monk Jifei was from Fujian, China. He fled to Nagasaki at the end of the Ming Dynasty, hid his surname, and became a monk after shaving his head. The reporter was unable to find out the surname of monk Jifei, so he carefully examined all the places. Finally, he discovered on both sides of the middle gate of the temple, there was a stone inscription: "The sky is wide and the sea is vast, a unique place. Tigers crouch and dragons return, a singular gate." The writing is vigorous. The inscription at the bottom reads " ". Could it be the inscription of Monk Jifei's secular family name?</p>

<h3>Financial Spot Gold Returns to Peak</h3>
<p>The bank's cash price is increasingly brisk. Yesterday, the spot gold price rebounded, reversing several days of decline. However, the market situation is still stable, with no excessive fluctuations, with the price fluctuating only about two taels. As for foreign exchange, it was apparently stable but secretly tight. From the early market, Zhifengyong, Yuancheng Yong, Hengxing, etc. all actively pursued [foreign exchange], while Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, etc. mostly sold. Large orders were slightly reduced, and people's confidence strengthened, so the opening was high, and then there were slight ups and downs, hovering around 502 taels. However, the bank once purchased spot goods, and later in the market Yuansheng, Hengxing, Xinxing, etc. had very strong buying interest, while the selling positions were hedged, so the price felt more brisk. The exchange rate was strong, requiring settlement of 1 tael and 0.0575 for April East Exchange, and 11 pence and 0.0625 for British gold.</p>
<p>The opening price increased by one tael. The London silver bar also shrunk by one-sixteenth, and the silver price also decreased by one-quarter. The May opening price was reported as 501 taels, up one tael. The gross price rose calmly, with the buyers showing strength, and the exchange rate also strengthened. The recent British gold bank traded at 11 pence and 0.125 yuan, and the forward price was 0.25, so the first order revealed was 3 taels and 1 qian, but the listed price did not move.</p>
<p>Subsequently, because the sellers saw smooth sales, the internal exchange rates stabilized. China Banking Corporation traded June at 11 pence and 0.25, which depreciated by more than one tael, at 10:15 AM it was 1 tael and 6.7 qian. Then retail investors bought in, and banks traded with each other. The May US dollar was calculated at 47 yuan. Mitsui bought recent Japanese gold at 1 tael and 0.0525, so it has already returned to the previous price of about two qian, at 10:30 AM it was 2 taels and 6 qian.</p>

<h3>Foreign Cents Exceeded the Customs by Two Points</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday's market atmosphere remained the same as the previous few days, but external sales were slightly better, and people's confidence turned upward. Although there was no special increase, it has already exceeded the customs by two points. The need for silver capital is still loose. Banks' head linings have been withdrawing funds for days, so the situation ultimately has no good side. Jiangnan small coins have turned into a stable trend. Most likely the demand period has passed, and they have returned to silence.</p>
<p>Surcharges: Foreign cents have been lifeless for a long time. Yesterday morning they seemed to be slightly strong. The morning market was still 7 qian and 2 points, with no difference from the previous day. The noon market increased by 0.0375, to 7 qian, 2 points, 0.0375. People's confidence was brisk, and there was hope for a turnaround. The situation of silver dismantling has been exhausted for a long time, and there is no hope of brightening. Yesterday, the morning and noon markets again made 0.03, a decrease of 0.02 compared to the previous day. The scratch heads also did not add water. The atmosphere was in a slump. It is expected that this year's silver capital will not have the worry of rising high.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: Jiangnan small coins, the previous two days, small colleagues slightly bought tens of thousands due to the commission of foreign firms, causing the market price to suddenly increase. Yesterday, the sound and breath were silent again, so the market price has become weak and will not move arbitrarily. The morning and noon markets were both 6 qian and 2 points, a slight decrease of 0.0005 compared to the previous day's noon. Transactions were only 1,500 jiao in the morning market. Guangdong small coins then turned higher by 0.001, with both morning and noon markets opening at 5 qian, 9 points, and 0.0085, transactions were 145,000 jiao in the morning market, and 40,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins were shortened by 3,000 wen, to 393,000 qian, a tighter situation than the previous day.</p>
<p>There were still more than 30,000 strings of transactions.</p>
<p>Silver and Foreign Coin Inflow and Outflow: "Silver funds" are collected and settled by banks every day. In view of the fact that the business of Qianzhuang is not very expanded, all kinds of collections and settlements are also very simple. Yesterday, various Chinese banks collected and settled more than 1.7 million in drafts, and various foreign banks collected and settled less than 1 million in drafts, and various freight, exchange, tax, and sundry collections amounted to more than 9 million, silk outflow was more than 400,000, and out of the warehouse was 2.1 million.

<h3>Interest for March is 2 Taels</h3>
<p>The interest rate for this March has already been proposed by the Qianye Association's standing committee the other day, and it has been decided to be 2 taels, 0.95 deduction. According to the statistics of this silver dismantling, the capital is only 0.09, so although the silver capital is loose, the depositors still occupy the advantage. As for the overdue interest, it is still stipulated by the old rules, making 4 and a half taels sitting plate increase, the highest interest rate is still no more than 10 taels and 0.05 qian, the second is no more than 7 or 8 taels' spectrum. In the past years, in February and March (except for last year), the interest rate was always at 4 or 5 taels, and if we estimate this year's gold is expensive and silver is cheap situation, I am afraid that there will be no high silver dismantling.</p>

<p>The yarn market has turned firm, and the situation is very good. Because major merchants are searching for nearby months</p>
<p>The market is tight, and at the same time, those who profit also take short positions, and a certain manufacturer's attitude</p>
<p>Is quite calm, most targets on the commercial market, must see the price return to an increase of two taels, will see 153 or 154 taels, however, the major sellers' thinking is still at the bottom, their goods are abundant, and the intention to offset is not cut off, the multi and short sides hold each other very strongly, but the overseas cotton yarn market conditions, the rising wind has subsided slightly, and the future is still based on the situation and actual sales as the foundation.

<h3>Cotton Market as Stable as Ever</h3>
<p>The cotton market is still firm, but US cotton has fallen slightly. This is a small fall after a big rise, and it has no major relationship with the market, so the people's confidence in this port is still watching high. In addition, the bottom goods are next missing, and the Han gang are pulling tight and not letting go, so the market is temporarily very difficult to fall. However, actual transactions are still clear, and the attitude of each factory is also very dull.</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Falling Sharply</h3>
<p>Only the South City is Still Flat</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the sources from various roads were still strong. Although it was rainy, there were also more than 40 ships arriving. However, the buying appetite was unusually clear. Northern japonica rice fell by two angles, with a return of half a yuan in the two days, which can be called a sharp rise and a sharp fall. Thin rice sales were sluggish, and the feet were few and far between. The market continued to shorten by two</p>
<p>Three angles, the delivery of Yangbu indica rice was not strong, the path was affected by the sharp fall in foreign rice, all were waiting and watching, the market was tired near the angle. As for the variable silver dollars, the buying was silent, and both arrival and sales were weak, with high-quality goods around 18 yuan.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: About ten ships arrived at Hexia, street sales were average, the high price of Changxi gang machine japonica rice sales were active and firm, the secondary slightly repaired and cut, the market atmosphere was still acceptable, Su Tong gang white japonica rice countryside was quite sought after, but due to the North City's depression, the eating price was extremely tight, and the overall price was lack of ups and downs, Nan Bang thin rice and early rice, although the Ning Bang's intention to enter was weak, but the goods were sold by the guests, so the prices were flat, Duzi indica rice and Yang indica rice arrivals were few, the guest stomach was quiet, the market was footed by foreign materials, making it difficult to develop, the Foreign Rice Association, due to the significant rise and fall in the market price, all transactions must be in cash, and the margin must be increased again, speculators were greatly affected, there were few transactions, and the buyers were rare, and the price fell sharply, the top goods of white dollars were particularly good, the secondary goods were thick and average, and the situation was still lacking in honor and disgrace.</p>
<h3>Strong Sales After the Fall in Foreign Rice Prices</h3>
<p>A fall of two angles in the morning... a rise of two angles at noon: Yesterday, after the opening price of foreign rice in the morning, the returned goods were sold out in competition, and the spot rice was also suppressed and sold off, resulting in another fall of two angles in the current rice, and the futures rice was also close to the money. After the market price fell slightly, it suddenly aroused competition among local street village and inland customers, and the market price immediately rose by two angles. As a result, there was no major difference from the previous market, and the situation was tired and stable. The Tong City futures sold more than 3,000 tons of returned goods, and foreign firms sold 2,400 tons of a small twist in March and April, and more than 10,000 bags of spot goods were opened, and 5,000 bags of road goods were traded, all of which were taken by local street village and inland customers.</p>
<h3>Flour Market is Beautiful</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, the market in each month was no different from the previous market, but it was heard that foreign wheat was slightly better, and the Beiyang gang even purchased spot and futures goods, and the air pressure on the market was tense. The manufacturers, because there were customers to inquire, no longer came out again. In addition to loading the current goods, the Bei gang also searched for the four, five, and six months futures, so the floating empty positions were offset, and the sellers in the mainland were also waiting and watching and did not come out. As a result, April was 0.75 large, May, June, July, and August were 0.01 large, and September was 0.001 large.</p>
<h3>Wheat Trending Upward</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market conditions, at the opening, each month was weak, and no single bag was traded in this month. Later, it was heard that the flour market turned around, and there was also factory transformation of the current wheat, and people's confidence turned good. In the afternoon,</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Piece Goods Turn Stagnant</h3>
<p>Piece goods transactions are gradually becoming quiet. Mainland buyers have largely concluded their purchases. As the time approaches the old calendar's Qingming Festival, merchants customarily return home to sweep tombs, so arrivals in Shanghai are becoming increasingly rare. The trade associations are also showing signs of stagnation. Due to the influence of the current situation, it is difficult for guest merchants to recover for the time being, especially those from Sichuan, whose stagnation is most pronounced. This is because they shipped too many goods in the first half of the year, and the overall situation has been unstable, leading to a complete slump. The demand from merchants along the Yangtze River is sporadic. Yesterday, merchants from Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other places slightly increased their purchases, and prices remain firm. Eastern goods such as crepe and serge are still active. Yesterday, "Cai Yuan Bai Zi Tu" (財源百子圖) sold for 2.2325 yuan per chi, "Hu Xin Ting" (湖心亭) for 2.24 yuan, "Feng Bo Ting" (風波亭) for 2.2425 yuan, and "Bao Qiu" (寳球) for 2.2725 yuan. Tribute satin has slightly softened again, with first-class goods selling for 2.2525 yuan, "Si Xue Shi" (四學士) for 2.2475 yuan, and "San Ma Tou" (三馬頭) for 2.245 yuan. Western goods, such as plain foreign yarn, are becoming increasingly active due to sales orders. Yesterday, "Ru Yi Tian Guan Shi Se" (如意天官什色) from Taihe sold for 12 taels, "Jin Wei Wei" (金危危) from Yi Ji for 11.75 taels, and "Nao Tian Gong" (閙天宮) from Taihe for 10.05 taels. Local merchants all have ways to manage. White bar muslin, evening delivery method, and printed crepe are also quite active.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Zhang Diaoqing Opens Down 20 Cash</h3>
<p>Raw Sugar and White Sugar Market Fall and Transaction are Quiet. Yesterday's sugar market received telegrams from producing areas. New York futures sugar for May was 1.71, down 5 points; September was 1.82, down 4 points; December was 1.89, and March was 1.94, each down 3 points. The current price of Javanese sugar is 10.6875, slightly up 0.0625; May is 10.875, up 0.125; June is the same price, with no change. The trade association's clearing price for No. 24 raw sugar white cloth was very slack, quoted at 7.25 taels, with rare transactions and a weak market. No. 20 medium sugar white was 7.1 taels, with quiet demand. Japanese sugar transactions were sporadic, and the market was weak. YT mark was 7.2625 taels, HN mark was 7.8 taels, and YRO mark was 7.3 taels, with more goods leaving the warehouse. This is because sales everywhere have been stagnant recently, leading to setbacks and a general sense of decline. The number plate transactions were even quieter. There was a continuation of Zhang Diaoqing arrivals. Yesterday, over a hundred bags opened, priced at 6.3 taels, a decrease of 20 cash from the previous price. The piled goods were slightly inferior, so they were well-received. The market showed signs of decline.</p>

No. 8 sells for 8 taels per dan, No. 10 for 8.25 taels, No. 12 for 9 taels, and No. 14 for 9.5 taels. Currently, very few goods are arriving, and it is expected that the market will continue to rise.</p>

<h3>The Sale of Ancient Palaces in Vienna</h3>
<p>The Sorrow of the End of the Austrian Imperial Family</p>
<p>The revolutionary climax in Austria over the past decade has turned many magnificent palaces and great buildings in Vienna into desolate scenes of empty buildings. The residences of former princes and ministers now have signs saying "House for Sale" posted on their dusty gates.</p>
<p>Under the oppression of "Socialism," the former nobles are subject to extremely heavy taxes. Now, their lives are no longer comfortable, let alone noble. Although Vienna is still as prosperous as before, and the Danube River is still a luxurious city, times have changed. It can no longer be called the most beautiful imperial capital in Europe.</p>
<p>What about these palaces that evoke historical memories? Alas, after the auction house sells those precious portraits, exquisite carpets, and other treasures passed down from generation to generation, those modern furnishings with a merchant's air will soon come in and show off. The former royal conference room will now be turned into a dining room, and the former servants in black uniforms will now have to be wronged to become slaves who are called upon. Thus, wealthy merchants immediately become nobles.</p>
<p>However, in fact, who would be willing to spend money to buy such a great palace? Because ordinary people, no matter how large their family is, will feel empty and unable to enjoy comfort once they are inside the palace. The rooms inside are so empty, and it is not easy to heat the air. Moreover, the corridors are so long that the dishes from the kitchen must be reheated because they are cold when they are delivered to the dining room at meal times. Moreover, the palace has no elevator, no modern bathroom, and no radiator. People who are used to enjoying modern civilization are unwilling to go to the ancient palace. Speaking of the size of the empty hall, not to mention other things, "just the front part is already a quarter of a mile long. Undoubtedly, this is the most perfect and greatest palace in the world. The most famous Schönbrunn Palace, like Windsor Castle in England, is the most comfortable summer resort. It has 1,400 rooms, countless artistic treasures, and exquisitely arranged gardens. Now, it is all a place for travelers to enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>The Belvedere Palace, which was used as the residence of Crown Prince Servais, is almost an art exhibition hall. Many priceless works of art are displayed in the palace. When Archduke Ferdinand was exiled from the Belvedere Palace to Sarajevo in 1914, that was where he and his wife said goodbye forever. Now, anyone who goes to pay their respects to the family cannot help but sigh and mourn. "Charles, the last king of Austria, his last palace, Luxembourg," has many strange paradises, ancient spires, artificial mountains, grottoes, waterfalls, and oak trees. Now it has been converted into a theater and the most famous dance school in the world. Where have the owners of these palaces gone? Those beautiful princes and charming concubines, who once indulged in the dream of youth, are now suffering from the oppression of life and will never have the opportunity to make eyes at their lovers. Many have been sacrificed under the cannon fire during the revolution, and those who are alive have given up their palaces to rent to others, willing to live in smaller houses, because those palaces are old buildings, and during rainy days, rainwater will drip from the roof. They have to collect some rent to repair these palaces. However, many descendants of nobles, who have been living in luxury, are now willing to save on daily living expenses, but they are unwilling to lower their status to work with ordinary people. Therefore, they are still using brilliant silver tableware and crystal clear wine glasses, but there are not many vegetables.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the most distressed are the women of the nobility. Their training is</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>laziness, and their knowledge is etiquette. Now that they have nothing, they have to rely on the charitable organizations of the "Noble Welfare Homes." The economic supply of this institution is provided by the wealthy who have once received royal favors. But unfortunately, this institution has now been banned by the authorities, and even the basic funds have been confiscated. Therefore, the seamstresses on the streets of modern Vienna are no longer Jewish women. Those who have replaced their positions are noble women. Women from the United Kingdom and the United States are desperately buying jewelry in Vienna's jewelry stores. Who would have thought that these jewels and treasures once shone on the bodies of those seamstresses and seduced so many men?</p>
<p>In the recent tragedies, a young princess worked as a maid in a wealthy family in Vienna, a duke was arrested by the police for begging for money during Christmas, and two members of the royal family worked as chauffeurs in a car company. The end of the nobility is the same in ancient and modern times, and it is the same at home and abroad, which is enough for us to sigh with emotion. (Jasmine)</p>
<h3>My Illness</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I have been entangled by illness for a year and a half. I have tasted enough of life in illness. On the day I fell ill, I slept in a desolate room, illuminated by the pale white light. The wind outside the window was howling. How could I not feel desolate and bitter in this scene? Unfortunately, I was lost on the wrong path of illness. In a few days, a small tumor bulged on my lower abdomen. My family sent me to the hospital. The doctor put ice on my lower abdomen day and night. It was in September, and it was so uncomfortable to sleep on that cold ice. After two weeks, it was still the same. One night in the deep and quiet third watch, when all was silent, I suddenly felt a piercing pain all over my body. At that time, I could only shed tears secretly, because my慈母(compassionate mother) was sleeping soundly, and I was afraid of waking her up. Alas, it really hurt.</p>
<p>It was really unbearable. The pain made me involuntarily cry out for help. At that time, the room was full of desolation, and the light was dim. I also heard the sound of pain and moans from the other sick rooms outside, which added to my immeasurable pain and immeasurable sadness. Then the doctor gave me an injection, but it still could not relieve my pain. The next day, I was in so much pain that I could not speak, and my face was pale.</p>
<p>According to the doctor, it was necessary to perform an abdominal operation. When I heard these words, how sad I was in my heart. Although life is a dream, everyone is afraid of hearing that they have to be dissected. Therefore, I held my 兹母's hand and cried and said, "The day I leave for the tomb is near. My illness will not get better." At that time, 兹母含着眼淚(with tears in her eyes), and comforted me sadly. After a while, the nurse hurriedly put a white coat on me and took me to the dissection room. I looked around and saw more than a dozen doctors and nurses surrounding me. At that time, I did not feel afraid. I thought this was God's protection. However, my mind was still thinking of 慈母(compassionate mother), he, dear sisters, etc. How much they loved me. I wonder if after the dissection, there would be a day to meet again? I was infinitely sad in my heart, and shed a lot of bloody tears. The doctor saw that I was too sad, and he came to comfort me, saying, "Don't be afraid, I will give you medicine to make you feel no pain." Then I was muddleheaded, as if ascending to heaven, and lost consciousness. After the operation, I had no breath. Fortunately, the doctor succeeded and gave me a saline injection before I regained consciousness. However, there was nothing in my abdomen, only some thick pus. Therefore, the doctor left an inch-long gap in the middle for me to drain the toxic pus. The rest was sewn up with thread. This painful scene of the demon of illness passed away with the setting sun. However, it has been half a year, and it has not yet closed. After repeated treatments, it is still ineffective. Now the hole is as small as a sesame seed, and thick pus flows out from time to time. Please readers study it and hope to answer in this publication. 金碧華自述(Jin Bihua's self-report)</p>
