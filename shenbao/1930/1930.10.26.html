<p>直茹（即暨南）樂華在惜原係一家情同手足茲則各奔前程分道揚鑣西人足球會中於是而有二隊並峙之旗幟焉昨日下午三時二隊相見於中華棒球場上作西人會甲組之賽眞茹人才平均實力健強終以四對零之結果凱旋而歸裁判李思廉眞茹隊</p>
<p>林松發　　　陳秉祥</p>
<p>馮運佑　　　　　　章榮文梁官濂　　　陳鎭和　　　戴麟經　　　江善敬　　　　　　陳家球　　　　　　莊世鴻　　　梅紅寶樂華隊</p>
<p>王季淮　　　楊人偉　　　李寗　　　　　　　李惠堂陸鐘恩　　　梁官松　　　余順章</p>
<p>安原生　　　　　　孫星岩</p>
<p>金鳳德　　　奚巧生（一）一家人先禮後兵</p>
<p>眞茹樂華二隊球員昔多在同一族幟之下相處已久感情自厚今雖相抗作戰如同仇敵然對面會見則又互相握手親熱若一家人矣觀者以為先禮後兵誠不虛也（二）老將梁官松出馬</p>
<p>戰笛已起之後吾人於雙方逐鹿中得見久未為樂華服務之梁官松梁曾一時為樂華之名中堅韶光飛流新陳代謝梁遂束身自讓賢今樂華不幸健將分散梁不服老挺身而起昨在最初十分鐘内竟賴其力脫一險球是亦梁式東山再起聲中一紀念之戰績也蓋自開戰以後陳秉祥由左挑中陸鐘恩椄之出險戴麟經繼進又被陸救眞茹三度挺進陸在四面楚歌之中難以兼顧陳家球乘隙攻門幸有梁官松扼守門前倒地一擋死裡逃生造成偉大戰績不愧老身手（三）猛眞茹壓倒樂華</p>
<p>眞茹聲勢之盛無以復加樂華區域幾為該隊所佔據左功右打前進後繼樂華得以保持半壁江山者幸有李寗與陸鐘恩二人李惠堂身居前方要職偶而反攻均未見功一次樂華乘對方空虛互傳入侵奚巧生挑中李頭頂攻門被梁官濂接出未幾李又挾球進展李倒地射球被阻橫出楊人偉再交中央無人接濟良機頓失而眞茹大隊人馬又長驅直入而作猛烈之功擊矣（四）變戰略眞茹獲救</p>
<p>眞茹五前鋒極有聯絡故其足跡恒不離球門二三十碼之間惟射擊無力又少變化加以陸鐘恩之守關無隙可乘以致勞而無功忽而戰略改變戴自左挑中陳家球佯作攻勢暗乃側身讓過梅洪寶如矢捷進一鼓而下陸全神對陳無暇顧梅遂告失守時為三時二十五分鐘又十五分鐘眞茹仍照前策由陳秉祥挑送中央戴亂人耳目身向前傾陳家球頂入門内眞茹乃德二對零戰勝於上半時李惠堂孤立無助</p>
<p>（五）梅洪寶縱橫自在</p>
<p>樂華梁官松身疲力乏退做内衛前鋒孫奚互調地位其餘悉無更動再戰已久奚孫突形聯絡連破關塞一球挑中越過内衛李惠堂身當其衝加鞭捷進江善敬從旁追至阻其發足方告無事同時眞茹反攻步驟多自右翼蓋樂華左前衛王季淮實非梅洪寶敵手梅得縱橫自在如入無人之境四時十五分鐘時梅一馬右進挑向中央章榮文隨勢一腳直入網中又五分鐘陳家球又傳球門前梅身旁無人縱容一頂碰然入網眞茹遂得以四對零獲勝云（六）李惠堂孤立無助</p>
<p>樂華之被眞茹壓倒自在意料之中其最弱之點厥為中衛線進不能功退不能守致樂華内外截然中斷著名左右鋒李惠堂孤立無助屢進失效最後在零對四失勢之下李仍困獸猶鬥匹馬單槍深入陣中江善敬緊依其旁礙其進取惟李賴其靈活身叚仍得挑送中央眞茹内部空虛孫星岩遂乘隙攻打不料操之過急倒地失足嗣後李又予楊人偉射門之機會惜楊當面錯過奧喪萬分於是樂華竟以湯團失敗開空前之記錄矣（七）評藝術各有千秋</p>
<p>雙方藝術各有專長陸之守門功夫已恢復昔往令名内衛馮運佑與李寗堅硬可靠江善敬亦能進退如意陳鎭和之中堅與孫恩敬堪稱伯仲前鋒中當以李惠堂與戴麟經最佳眞茹二翼以對方前衛不佳得以隨心所欲以全隊論樂華内部不及眞茹穩固然較上次已有　步前鋒仍見紛亂氣象一時尙難達到活潑敏捷之工作如昨日之眞茹者然其前途固尙有進步之希望也[L西人會昨賽結果</p>

<p>書報介紹野玫瑰  湯增敭　　心因作　　前鋒月刊　　偉大的含蓄已久的民主主義文藝的創作終於在民主主義文藝的理論已有特異著續的現今必然的突現於國内的文壇上了在表面上看來它有似一朵暴發的奇花異葩即新鮮又艷麗實際上我們是很能夠明瞭民主主義文藝在久遠久遠之前已經確立了鞏固的基礎不然的話即如心因君這樣罕見的傑作野玫瑰在思想上作者毋疑的是把握着民族主義文藝的中心那描寫着有力的美佈局的嚴密結構的緊湊在篇中顯然易見純粹以文藝的觀念來講這「野玫瑰已達到創作的高峰因為短篇創作上應具的幾種特點它都深深的取得而沒有遺漏的了這即是民族主義文藝已有悠長歷史的特徵　　全篇作者將它分為三段第一的開始便是描寫諸暨人民打獵的一般情況表閒着中國農村有的種種風趣同時也可使我們推想到中國「漁獵時代」人民生活的一斑其次是由民衆的口中表露出來的孫傳芳軍隊的暴虐橫行吃盡「北老兒的苦頭」而從内心逗引起無限的切齒之恨在這鍾情勢之下一般民衆所企望為人為國謀福利的北伐軍早日降臨當然成為一種最普遍的心裡所以篇中的配角阿明撅起他的闊嘴露出尖銳的眼光對阿大這樣的說「北伐的革命軍眞是利害他們是來我們出氣的革命軍來了我們　有出頭的日子」像這樣含有深摯意義的希望語在民十三國民革命軍由革命策源的廣東誓師北伐之際隨時隨地都可以聽聞得到的不過關於諸暨人民最熱烈的一顆心是在「野玫瑰」中赤裸裸的表現出來了說到北老兒的作威作福作者豐富的思緒便聯想到旅人在浙江攪亂世界的兇暴情狀這種強有力的名族意識作者深深的把握着的再其次是描寫篇中女主角阿玫的健美具有勇敢的責任心她愛男主角啊榮的「強健」「大胆」「勇敢」後來她看出阿榮實有一個懦怯的男子她便沉痛的再說「但是現在這一個夢她已經打破了打破得乾乾淨淨」此後她底愛是堅決的轉移「影響革命軍去消滅這班北老兒」的何三保底身上來再另一方面她仍是用愛的立場來激動阿榮的努力革命這即是篇中最着重的以革命為中心的三角戀愛底開端這顯然地是含有偉大底意義决是那種迎合低級心裡的以性為中心的三角戀愛故事可以互相比擬在文字方面作者是要極端的「一般化」與「普遍化」所以在明白樸質的對話中舊有民間歌謠和諺語加入其間這也是作者所表現特長的一點而且這種技術實可算是僅見例如這第一段裏阿玫曾這樣的說　　算了罷何三保的事用不着你來過問要好是要兩相情願的「男想女隔重山女想男隔重單」明白些可憐的阿榮哥　　在藝術上這無疑地已有相當的成功所表現着農家女子的一顆心眞是盡善盡美像這種真情流露的對話非體騐過多　鄉村風趣地作者不能描寫下來的　　第二段作者的表現力漸漸的強烈起來這也是全篇佈局上起伏的着眼寫何三保組織隊伍的熱忱預防孫傳芳兵隊的嚴密在尖利的日光下抖擻起革命應有的眞精神這都有最生動的刻畫激起讀者勇敢直前的革命心奮鬥心堅毅地躍起和那蹂躪生民的北老兒一搏戰由此可見作者手腕的高超了次述被戀愛的波浪而激起來革命的阿榮在擊敵聲中的幻想對於阿玫意義留戀的癡態妬嫉何三保將他所愛的「一朵玫瑰花」搶奪了去在怒火高冲的刹那他是想在暗中槍斃何三保但是突然間他底腦海中又顯現著「只許明搶交戰不許暗箭傷人」的輝煌信條那不正確的幻想是終究在夥伴激戰的聲中幻消了其中還穿插着阿玫慰勞自己隊伍的情熱分担了何三保應做的工作一部份處處都表露着女性的健美勇敢的阿玫當然就是作者所要表現的一個中國典型的女性這是我們也不能否認像阿玫這種毅力和精神作者所寫的全結構市喜劇同悲劇的合流這第二段便帶着了些悲劇的潛伏關於此是短篇小說中最須注意之點作者是把握着而無毫厘的缺憾這即是「野玫瑰」在藝術上應該得到的偉大的估價亦即民族主義文藝的創作技巧達到圓熟的地步的表象　　第三段是寫何三保殺敵的勇奮阿玫更其是加緊了她底革命工作的原動力其中最重要的是寫當時何三保和孫傳芳隊伍激戰的情狀在事前的準備是以擣碎大焦黑得飯鍋拔出釘鞋上的鐵定為戰鬥的彈子那一節最為有力赤裸裸地表現出當時諸暨人民對於革命的熱忱袛求國軍的來到殘害中華的北老兒是徐急迫地將他消滅了的自己個人及其它重重的犧牲是一點也不顧計這種偉大的精神實是中華名族性的發揚這是我們讀者應該深深地注意的　　三分鐘的時間釘鞋刺離開了牠們的母體十五分鐘時間幾千只釘鞋刺同樣地和母體分離　　一大羅一大羅的碎鐵頃刻之間搬運了出去槍擊聲一步步的逼緊一百多個獵人一步一步向村前退回村裏的空氣愈顯着急迫　　何三保的號砲突然間開放不及掩耳的迅雷震醒了全山的噩夢他第一個挾着槍衝向前前去　　槍聲逐漸减少又漸漸平息下去村外的火勢已經消失了一半村裏的婦女這時候也提了削竹刀屠刀菜刀柴刀獵叉一切的武器在侵骨的曉風中衝了出去</p>

<p>由上面所描寫的情景看來顯然可以知道當時諸暨人民革命情緒的熱烈在此情勢下有何三保的指揮得力阿玫多方面的臂助及阿榮和許多伙伴的奮命作戰孫傳芳部下的殘餘軍隊段世貴終於被何三保的主力軍擊潰了不過被戀愛的波浪而激動起來發奮革命的阿榮是在「最後的惡鬥」中犧牲了值得紀念的生命這時作者表現阿玫的心理更為生動靈活同時寫阿榮最後有意義的呻吟也現出「光榮的死」底偉大當靑天白日的旗旌在山上扶搖直上之際高呼勝利的聲中阿榮的兩目是漸漸地埀閉着了這是悲劇的結終　　全篇中的概略我們在此可以深知無遺了此種題材是發揚中華民族性的期間應該採取它作創作的内容因為這些作者所表現於夜玫瑰中的事件都是充滿了豐富的民族的意義尤其是帶着濃厚的地方色彩這也是「野玫瑰」所具的特點之一而且他所表現的三角戀愛以及女主角阿梅的對象像「野玫瑰」這種題材是有偉大的意義决不是流行於讀書界的一般性愛創作可比描寫農民革命的奮興熱烈更其精緻可喜在藝術上作者無疑地已取得成功不過這還是民族主義文藝的創作起始呢民眾  思賢　　李翼之作　　　近來很有些人對於民族主義文藝加着一種曲解和誣篾他們的處心我們不用說然而從着實際上我們却可知道他們對於民族主義文藝的理論是根本沒有認識也不願認識他們只是從着自己的迷惘裏根據着積存在牠們腦髓裏的歷來錯誤腐朽的觀念排成一種形式就算是已經捉到了民族主義文藝的理論於是便扭着不放自鳴得意和勝利如最近（十月八日）「覺悟」正平君的「民族主義文藝應該避免的幾種態度」一文便是一種顯明的例子　　本來像這樣來去接和誣篾在某種意義上是他們的慣技只反映了他們的盲目和無知然而爲了大多數讀者不受這種欺騙起見對於這一種克服是有必要這種克服可分兩方面第一是理論的其次是作品的在這裏便是想從作品方面來給這種曲解誣篾者一種答覆而使大多數讀者更能有深一步的認識　　民族主義文藝作品現在自然還是很少但從「前鋒周報」中我們已看到了「白馬山」「一國的靑年」「到武漢」等幾篇在這幾篇中牠有的是怎樣的内容讀過的當然能夠知道現在再從最近第十六期的「民衆」來分析我想如果有梁　秋先生精明的「看貨色」態度的當不至再是狂吠罷　　「民衆」這是一個短篇小說在這裡所描寫的是「兵災匪患途中的民衆」兵災匪患在中國近年來是沒有一個時候沒有也沒有一個地方沒有而中國的民衆就在這樣兵災匪患中掙扎我們知道中國民族在今日一方面是受列強帝國主義的壓迫一面却是殘餘的封建勢力緊緊包圍着在這樣的情形下農村經濟漸漸破產農民問題便成了革命過程中一個重要現象現在各地的農民紛紛向着都市工廠跑留着在農村的失業飢饉流為匪盜而在湘鄂贛一帶近年以來共黨煽亂農民在一種脅迫殘殺之下於是更相率為匪長沙幾次的失陷造成了空前的浩刦在全國該地實已成了兵災匪患的典型作者在這裏所取的背景便是今日水深火熱的江西是全國兵災匪患的典型底一角一幕縣城失陷的事像這樣的事普遍在全江西也就是近來各地常見的事這樣作者是抓住了時代的尖端而又儘量的描寫了農民的痛苦曝露了該地直接促使農民勾結土匪的靖衛隊的罪惡而作者正是從這樣的地方逃出來的一個他身經了一切的痛苦因此寫來處處流露着實感　　這裏我覺得可惜那個自以為「覺悟」了得正平君沒有看見坐在暗房裏還再說什麼民族主義文藝「旣不敢描寫工農的痛苦更不願宣泄一部份社會罪惡者的陰謀何略邇」這樣掩耳盜鈴的話眞有些不覺悟　　然而作者並不以這樣深刻的描寫和宣泄為止境接着他又顯示了一個問題　　「現在一般人差不多都以上海為唯一的出路上海簡直可說是中國資財的集中地了只看内地的民衆窮人大半跟土匪去小有產者以上的誰不捲點細軟以上海為安樂窩呢」　　是得上海已成了中國資財的集中地内地的兵災匪患一天天劇烈上海的人口實在一天天的增加市面也覺得繁華起來這是一個顯見的事實　　「外國銀行又存大批的資本好擴充營業總無非是帮外人的忙罷了　　中國的資財並不集中在中國人的手裏中國的内亂正是做成了帝國主義經濟侵略的目的而中國的内亂直接間接都是帝國主義所造成這些也都是顯見得事實　　於是作者這樣的喊了「上海是正確的路嗎上海市民眾的出路嗎眼見一個大苦難的時期要到臨了」　　作者是處處從經濟着眼說明了民族今日是在走向那滅亡的途徑而堅決的反對這種以死路為出路並且昭示了民族應走方向　　像這樣能說是「不能洞燭社會的病態民生的疾苦的文藝」嗎曲解誣篾者的辛勞日拙在這樣的分析介紹之下當能是判定了罷　　現在我們再說從另一方面看作者在這裏寫下了他到上海半年來的生活在這生活的描寫中對於妻的一種心里的分析是很成功的雖然這種心理似乎是感傷一點但對於中國女子的一種美德何特性在這裡是被活畫出了　　妻從内地到上海來分擔了我一半勞苦她雖然是沒有負起過這麼重的擔子要做再麼多的事但彷彿這是不可避免的其中似乎含有什麽更重大的意義於是她不悲哀也不怨恨只靜悄悄的處理　　有時我寫稿子她望望我不說什麼依然低著頭做她的事然而在她幽悒而疲勞的眼光中她的心思我是很明白的　　像這樣耐勞忍性的習慣通力合作的精神相互了解得態度都是中國民族性的偉大的遺留是極可寶貴的此外作者對於妻的懷念在他内心上劃過的不安是毫不虛飾地流露着一股真摯的熱情讀着眞會使人感動得流淚　　她來到上海是幾個月幾個月中除了給她每日十小時以上的勞苦連單衣也不會製一件給她這何嘗盡了做丈夫的責任他年靑學識也足夠維持她的生活然而她現在的生活是與一個極平常的少婦沒有分別了也許這含苞的蓓蕾不等她展放開來便歸於萎謝罷生活長此這樣嚴酷地支配着我們　　「生活長此這樣嚴酷地支配着我們」這正是現在中國民族的一個慘憺的說明同時也昭示了我們怎樣來努力　　全篇的結構也是很緊湊圓熟的我們不能不說這是一篇有力的作品　　然而重要的却是顯示了民族主義文藝理論的正確由這些眞憑實據揭露了曲解誣篾者的伎倆出版界消息　　時代靑年社出版之時代靑年第十二期已出版要目有谷君之「中國靑年的責任」德懋之「文人的權威」李英樵之「討與詩人」王叔英之「我所知道的陳忘道」英樵之「王獨清你要拖到哪去呀」楊家俱之「　靑年們」本埠各大書店及各學校號房皆有特約銷售　　斐倫路三四號上海草野社出版部最近出版湯曾　著妹妹的殘骸後又接連出版金寬生著「婚前小記」是書共一百二十六頁另加彩色揷圖五幅分報紙白道林紙黃道林紙三種售價亦分三角五角二元三種是書係金君之處女作筆調簡潔敘事眞善特為誌其訂婚紀念各書店均有寄售社友直接向社購買可得七折優待云書報介紹稿例　　（一）文字以介紹國內國外最新之出版物為限除文藝著作外一切政治經濟法律科學教育等書報均在介紹之列惟無聊之書報恕不介紹　　（二）圖書以國內國外新作家最近作品及與文字有關之附圖為限　　（三）關於中國古書之考證或研究等文字恕不刊登　　（四）圖靈及照片均以與文字有關者為限　　（五）文字每篇至多不得過三千　　（六）稿紙勿寫兩而　　（七）稿勿橫寫字勿草潦西文可省則省如不得已須引用原文須附於譯文之下</p>

<p>Nanjing: Regarding the Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiations, the Japanese representative's counterproposal on our side's recovery of the Shanghai-Nagasaki line is roughly that the rights of the line be handed over to the Chinese government, but with over 20,000 Japanese residents in Shanghai, most of the Shanghai-Nagasaki line's business is on the Japanese side. The proposed solution is for China to set up a telegraph office in Shanghai, with the business affairs managed by the Japanese, the director appointed by China, and the staff all Japanese. Our side believes that this plan is too far from the principle of recovery and is difficult to agree to. It is proposed to shelve the Shanghai-Nagasaki line and first resolve other issues. However, the Japanese representative insists on resolving this line first and will not discuss other issues until it is resolved. Therefore, the representative is delaying his trip to Nanjing. (25th Special Dispatch) – Nanjing: Japanese Consul General to Nanjing, Uemura, went to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 25th to meet with Shigemitsu Aoi and Yoshino Keisaburo to discuss Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiations and convey our side's eagerness to hold a meeting.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<p>British Policy on Palestine and Wreath-Laying at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier: Any action that benefits one party may harm another; any action that benefits the future may harm the past. Therefore, it is impossible to take an action that everyone praises and no one opposes. However, it depends on the policy being pursued. The British Labour Party's policy on Palestine is unanimously opposed by Jews, while Arabs celebrate it as a success. The Labour government firmly believes that today's actions are correct, but many members of the wartime coalition cabinet oppose it. Liberal Party leader George even said that it is a clear breach of national credit. General Smuts also sent a telegram expressing great dissatisfaction, saying that Balfour's declaration was a matter of honor and obligation and must be fully fulfilled regardless of the cost. This shows the strength of the opposition. The British suggestion to abolish wreath-laying at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from the European War has angered the Belgian newspapers. British veterans strongly oppose it, and American veterans' groups also disapprove. Although German newspapers do not criticize it, they use headlines such as "Eliminating Hatred," implying their support. The German government has expressed its welcome and hopes that other countries will follow Britain's lead in promoting a new era of peace. From these two events, it can be seen that seeking to preserve the past and welcome the future will inevitably lead to many conflicts of interest, and support and opposition will arise from this. This is indeed the majority view. Important Domestic Telegrams Two</p>

<p>Statistics on Losses from the Jinpu Railway War</p>
<p>Pukou Dispatch: The Jinpu Railway has suffered extremely significant capital losses in the past two years due to looting by soldiers in Shibu and destruction caused by the two anti-rebellion military campaigns last year and this year. The losses cover locomotives, rolling stock, railway lines, bridges, houses, electrical wires, materials, firearms, equipment, public funds, and other railway assets. The estimated figures are as follows: (1) The loss from looting and forced requisition of funds during the Shibu mutiny last year totaled 100,284.55 yuan; (2) The loss of all locomotives in the past two years is approximately 3,407,130 yuan, and the loss of passenger and freight cars is approximately 3,571,290 yuan. The estimated loss for repairing the remaining damaged locomotives and rolling stock is approximately 5,567,500 yuan; (3) The loss from repairing damaged bridges, culverts, tracks, and all other buildings, as well as the forced collection of land rent by Shibu, is approximately 1,369,000 yuan; (4) The loss from repairing damaged electrical machinery, telephones, and railway signs is approximately 16,000 yuan; (5) The loss of coal and various materials due to looting by Shibu and military requisitioning is approximately 340,000 yuan; (6) The loss of firearms, clothing, and various furnishings along the line due to looting by Shibu and military action is approximately 100,000 yuan or more. The total of the above six items amounts to approximately 14,170,000 yuan in capital losses. As for the business losses suffered in the past two years due to the Shibu incident and military action, compared with the income of the 14th year, the income for the entire 18th year was reduced by approximately 7,160,000 yuan, and the income for the first half of this year was reduced by approximately 7,770,000 yuan. The reduction in the second half of the year is also approximately the same, totaling approximately 20,000,000 yuan in business losses. Furthermore, after the Jin army retreated, the railway bureau immediately sent personnel to Tianjin to take over the northern section and concentrated the rolling stock from the northern section. It was originally planned to resume full north-south traffic on Double Ten Day to facilitate transportation, but things did not go as planned. The rolling stock in the northern section has not yet been deployed and concentrated, and the plan to resume full traffic has not been realized. Currently, due to the lack of rolling stock, the first and second class trains and the Pingpu train only run to Jinan, and another passenger-freight mixed train runs from Jinan to Dezhou. Passenger and freight tickets are also sold only to Dezhou. Efforts are now being made to restore full traffic, which may be realized soon. (Wuchen News Agency)</p>

<p>Changsha Dispatch: In addition to the 19th Division (Li Jue) and the 77th Division (Luo Lin) of He Jian's Fourth Route Army leaving the province to enter Jiangxi and jointly attacking the Communists from Pingxiang towards Yuanzhou, the Communists within Hunan Province who are destroying railways and telegraph lines, killing and arsoning in the Changsha, Pingjiang, Liuyang, Xiangyin, and Yuezhou areas, led by Kong Hechong, Li Shixing, Huang Gonglüe, etc., have been divided into routes by He Jian for suppression, as follows: (A) Changsha Area: (1) The 15th Division (Wang Dongyuan)'s Wang Zhibin Brigade is responsible for guarding the provincial capital and dispatching a regiment to garrison Yong'an City between Changsha and Liuyang to eliminate bandits.

Because the majority of the Communists led by Kong Hechong, Li Shixing, and Hu Yun are in Pingjiang, the dispatched forces are particularly strong. (D) Yueyin Area: Currently, there are only remnants of the Communists, so He Jian has assigned troops to clear them in sections along the Xiang-E Railway. The area from Changsha to Guiluo is handled by the 2nd Bandit Suppression Brigade of Western Hunan (Tong Kun), the area from Huangsha Street to Yuezhou is handled by the Independent Regiment (Ye Wenke), and the area from Yuezhou to Lukoupu, which borders Hubei, is handled by the 1st Bandit Suppression Detachment (Guo Bugao).

The bandits were unable to withstand the attack and fled in separate directions towards Gugang and Gaoping. According to intelligence, the bandits attacking the city were the 1st Brigade of Huang Gonglüe's forces, with more than 1,600 riflemen and two machine guns, coming from Cihua, Jiangxi.

<p>Zhang Huizan's Letter Reporting the Bandit Suppression Situation</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: Zhang Huizan, the commander-in-chief of the Jiangxi bandit suppression, sent a letter to He Jian reporting the recent bandit suppression situation in Jiangxi. The letter was issued on the 17th of this month and arrived in Hunan yesterday. The letter detailed eight items as follows: (1) Zhu, Mao, Huang, and other troops, with about 8,000 guns, plundered Ji'an after it fell, causing huge losses to the merchants and people of Ji'an. However, there were reports of crossing the east bank, but the planes patrolled the Ji'an and Jishui areas every day and reported that there were no large Communist bandits on the east bank. It seems that the troops are still entrenched near Ji'an and have not crossed to the east. (2) A large part of Peng's bandits, Wenyuan, etc., crossed Xingan on the sun and had a small contact with our sentry at Shikou. Before the cold day, a large part suddenly crossed to the west, seemingly fleeing towards Ji'an. According to the officers of the Yi (Zhenxiang) Regiment, the Peng bandits sneaked south along the west bank towards Renhexu, only twenty miles away from Laijiang. It can be concluded that they will flee south to Ji'an and join forces with Zhu, Mao, and Huang. (3) It is reported that there are still a large number of bandits in Xingan, posing a threat to Gao'an. (4) Since the Gong (Bingfan) Division was stationed in Gao'an, the bandits in Yinggangling, Gao'an, have retreated to Xin'yu. The bandits in Xin'yu may not attack Gao'an because of the presence of the Gong Division. (5) Our division, Dai (Yue) Brigade, with a part stationed in Qingjiang and the majority in Ligang Xuejiadu, and the Zhu (Yaohua) Brigade, with a part stationed in Xin'yu and the majority in Shikou Piaojiang, and the Wang (Jiejun) Brigade and Zhu (Xianzhi) Regiment in Yongtai, Wang Jiejun led the Chen (Yongchu) Regiment to Zhangshu. The above deployment is intended to give the bandits a major blow independently by the 18th Division before the friendly forces arrive, so as to ensure the safe movement of the friendly forces and eliminate rear concerns for the future encirclement and suppression. (6) Nanchang now has the Yue (Sen) and Luo (Shouyi) Brigades and supplementary reserve regiments responsible for construction, which is extremely complete. (7) The Nanxun line is stationed by the Cheng (Guangyao) Brigade and the Du 14 (Liu Yi) Brigade and the smuggling suppression Wen Department responsible for Jiujiang. (8) If the Xu (Kexiang) Division comes, please ask them to be responsible for suppressing the Fang (Zhimin) bandits in eastern Jiangxi. When the Li (Yunjie) Division arrives, please join the encirclement and suppression of Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang's troops. The general situation is as above, and other information will be telegraphed at any time. (October 21st)</p>
<p>The Tragic Situation of Zhu and Mao's Burning and Killing in Ji'an</p>
<p>County Government Agencies All Burned Down, Thousands of Civilians Killed and Looted</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Ji'an is the center of transportation, commerce, and culture in western Jiangxi, and also an important town on the Gan River. Since it was captured by Zhu and Mao on the 5th of this month, it has been under their burning, killing, looting, and kidnapping. According to those who escaped to the province, when Zhu and Mao attacked Ji'an, the number of people was about 20,000. After entering the city, they set fire to the county government, the power company, the county party headquarters, and the local court. Dozens of shops in the main street and west street were burned down. Farmers and scattered bandits from all directions gathered and successively captured and killed citizens and extorted money. It is estimated that about four to five thousand people were captured by the spear team. On the 6th, the Communists held a meeting in Zhongshan Hall and killed more than a hundred innocent people on the spot. Since then, the arrests and killings have continued every day, with the total number of people killed being more than two thousand, especially those who were retaliated against for minor reasons. Merchants with a little wealth were kidnapped and sent to the Donggu bandit den and priced at thousands or hundreds of yuan. Currently, all the oil, salt, cloth, and all goods of the various shops in the county have been looted. Moreover, most of the Communist bandits are dressed in rags and have been capturing thousands of civilians in the city for days to organize a laundry team to wash clothes exclusively for the bandits. The rest, such as stretcher teams, are exclusively for the Communist bandits to transport the looted items. Currently, most of the bandits are still in the Ji'an, Jishui, and Xiajiang areas, while most of the Peng and Huang bandits are in the Xinyu and Anfu areas. Gong Bingfan, Zhang Huizan, Tan Daoyuan, and other troops have joined forces to go out of the Gan River and Yuan River to advance along the river. The vanguard troops are still in Qingjiang and Xingan. The first and fifth squadrons of the aviation corps have three aircraft and set off yesterday to Ji'an and dropped dozens of bombs. At the same time, the aircraft descended to a very low altitude and strafed the bandits with machine guns. The Communist bandits fled in all directions in a panic. It is heard that Commander-in-Chief Lu ordered all divisions to quickly recover Ji'an and Xinyu because Ji'an has been burned and killed by the Communist bandits for a long time. As for Fang Zhimin, who captured Poyang, Fuliang, and Pengze, he is still fleeing towards northern Jiangxi. Xu Kexiang's division arrived in Xun on the 20th from Beijing and ordered his troops to move from Hukou to Raozhou and Jingzhen in eastern Jiangxi. Lu Ding returned to the province from Han via Xun today. Commander Xu will meet with Commander-in-Chief Lu to ask for instructions before supervising the troops to station in eastern Jiangxi.

<p>Qin Jianbin Returns to Henan from Jinan to Report</p>
<p>Han Fulü Sends Cheng Weiru to Accompany Him</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Qin Jianbin, deputy commander of Shi Yousan, was ordered by Shi Yousan to come to Jinan from Zhangde via a detour to visit Jiang Bocheng, chief counselor of the Xingying, and Han Fuqu, chairman of the provincial government, to ask the central government to intercede so that he would not be held accountable for the past, to allow him to surrender, and to designate a defense area to give him a title and provide him with military pay. Now that the matter has been completed, he urgently needs to return to Henan to report. Today (22nd) at 1:50 PM, he has taken a special first-class and second-class train car attached to the Taishan armored car on the Jinghan Railway and went north from Jinan to Dezhou, and then changed trains to go around to Zhangde to report everything to Shi Yousan. Qin told the fool at the station that there was no problem for Shi Yousan's troops to be under the control of the Northeast, but the title of commander-in-chief of the 13th Route Army could not be determined because Wang Jinyu's title was also commander-in-chief of the 13th Route Army. Since the titles of both parties are the same, there must be a change to avoid duplication. Jianbin's trip north is to return to Henan to report. Commander-in-Chief Jiang is broad-minded and does not hold him accountable for the past, which is very gratifying. It is heard that Han Fuqu also sent Councilor Cheng Weiru as a representative to Henan to negotiate everything with Shi Yousan. (22nd)</p>
<p>Shantou All Circles Hold a Demonstration Against France</p>
<p>For the Great Guangdong Steamboat Tragedy</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: After the French Great Guangdong Steamboat tragedy occurred, it aroused public outrage in the city. The All Circles formed the [13th] Tragedy Relief Association. The association held a demonstration and parade today (18th). The meeting was held at 10:00 AM. Those present from the presidium included Wen Xiren of the Municipal Education Association, Huang Yanbo of the Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society, Chen Runzhi of the Seamen's Union, Chen Jingqing of the Travel Industry Guild, Wang Zhiqian of the Women's Education Association, Chen Chixiang of the Civil Training Association of the Municipal Party Department, Zeng Shanpei of the Workers' Support Association, Guo Ziyu of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, etc. After paying their respects, Chen Chixiang of the presidium announced the reasons for the meeting, first stating the cause of the tragedy and the tough attitude of the French Consul after the protest was made. If a thorough protest is not made, humanity and justice will not be extended. It is hoped that the representatives present will continue to struggle with the enthusiastic spirit of today's meeting. The words were extremely indignant. Then Zeng Shanpei, a representative of the Workers' Support Association, reported on the tragedy. It was then resolved to send a telegram to the National Government to abolish unequal treaties and send a telegram to the French Minister to lodge a serious protest, demanding that the six points raised by the trade union be fully answered. The parade set off at 10:30 AM. The chief leader was Fang Changcai, a military training officer of the Municipal Boy Scouts. The academic leader was Wen Xiren, the business leader was Guo Ziyu, the party department leader was Fang Wencan, and the labor leader was Zeng Shanpei. The entire team consisted of more than 30,000 people. Wherever the team passed, thousands of people crowded the streets to watch. The entire team took more than an hour to pass, shouting slogans along the way. The shouting was especially enthusiastic when passing the French Consulate. The team dispersed at about 12:00 noon. All the shops in the city closed today and posted signs at the door: [Today, all the citizens of the city are on strike for the October 13th tragedy]. Workers in various industries also stopped working, and ferries and loading and unloading on the sea also stopped in the morning and participated in the parade. Beforehand, the foreign affairs workers in the western area tried to prevent them from participating, but they could not do anything because the workers stopped working voluntarily. All primary and secondary schools were also closed. The whole city was in a silent and solemn state. It is heard that the French Consul went to the headquarters of the 62nd Division yesterday and asked Xiang Hanping to protect them. Xiang replied that the government could not stop the people from expressing their views and hoped that the French Consul would temporarily restrain the French people and not go out on the day to avoid misunderstandings. The French Consulate did stop working for a day today, and the plaque at the door was not hung out (the plaque is usually hung every morning and taken down in the evening). The staff in the office avoided the Public Security Bureau and sent many plainclothes teams to protect the consulate nearby to prevent accidents. However, because the parade team was very disciplined, no accidents occurred. It is now learned that the French Consul has scheduled to hold negotiations again on the 20th. (18th)</p>
<p>The Question of the Existence and Abolition of the Chongwenmen Customs</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: At the beginning of the Northeast Army's entry into the pass, Yu Xuezhong issued a declaration stating that Zhang Xueliang would exempt all exorbitant taxes and levies. The merchants and people of Tianjin and Beijing heard this gospel and celebrated with their hands on their foreheads. In the past ten days, merchants in Tianjin and Beijing have been demanding the abolition of exorbitant taxes and levies like a rising tide. Only the military support donation and military special donation have been abolished by explicit order (Zhang Xueliang's order). The abolition of the Chongwenmen Customs duty on machine-made foreign goods, the 2.5% surcharge, the special tax on sugar, and the tax on fur and ivory has not yet been approved. Among them, the Chong Customs issue is the biggest and the merchants' movement to abolish it is the most enthusiastic. The newly appointed Chong Customs Superintendent, Fu Baoheng, seeing that the environment was not good, recently went to Liaoning to visit Zhang Xueliang to ask for instructions. Yesterday evening, he returned to Tianjin. The fool visited Mr. Fu at his private residence and asked whether the Chong Customs could be abolished. Mr. Fu's conversation was as follows: [I have been working in the Northeast transportation industry and have no experience in customs duties. This time, I was ordered by Chief Zhang to go to Beijing to take over. I had no intention of concurrently serving as superintendent, so all the takeover personnel I brought were employees of the Beining Railway Bureau (Mr. Fu was originally the Deputy Director of the Beining Railway Bureau). The other day, I returned to Shenyang to report the takeover process to Chief Zhang and asked to be replaced by a virtuous and capable person. Zhang said that he had his own method and told me to go back. So I came to Tianjin last night. Whether the Chong Customs will be abolished and what Chief Zhang's method is, I did not dare to ask at the time because I was a subordinate. This morning, I read the newspaper and learned that the merchants in Beiping had sent representatives Leng Jiaji and Yang Yijian and five others to Shenyang to petition. Standing in an objective position, I am very sympathetic to the abolition of the customs. Standing in a subjective position, I dare not blindly follow this fact. The history of the Chong Customs is long and cannot be compared with newly added donations and taxes. In the capitals of various countries, there are also many cases of double customs duties. After foreign goods are imported and pay customs duties, they are sold to the interior without paying any donations or taxes. However, the Chong Customs must pay an additional 3% donation and tax. When the Chong Customs was established in the eighth year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty, treaties were signed with various countries. Without precedent, various countries would never recognize the establishment of the Chong Customs. Although the Chong Customs was initially called the imperial palace rouge tax, it has become an important source of income for the national treasury after several changes. In recent years, foreign goods have flooded the market, accounting for more than twelve-twentieths of domestic goods. However, the tax rate cannot be increased due to treaty restrictions, and the tax rate on domestic goods has been increased to 37%. Therefore, many machine-made foreign goods impersonate imported goods and bribe foreign merchants to transport them on their behalf. During the supervision of Hu Ruoyu, the annual tax revenue was more than 2.4 million yuan. In recent years, because the taxes on tobacco, alcohol, kerosene, gasoline, etc. have been separately allocated to the municipal government and other agencies for collection, the Chong Customs tax revenue has been greatly reduced, and the annual revenue has been changed to more than 1.4 million yuan. The annual educational expenses for primary and secondary schools in Beiping need more than 900,000 yuan. The Chong Customs revenue can get 123,000 per month in the peak season. In addition to allocating educational expenses and the Customs' own expenses of 25,000 yuan (30,000 yuan per month in the past), the remainder is submitted to the special commissioner of the Ministry of Finance stationed in Beiping. However, the Army University also withdraws several tens of thousands of yuan from the commissioner every month. In fact, the Ministry of Finance cannot get the Chong Customs tax. The reasons for the abolition of the customs now are: (1) The capital has moved south, and the Chong Customs is not necessary to exist. (2) Exorbitant taxes and levies harm the people and are close to double taxation. The merchants in Beiping have sent representatives to request me. Although I have no right to abolish the customs, I have accepted their opinions and forwarded them to Chief Zhang. However, according to personal opinion, the suffering of the merchants should be relieved and the educational expenses should also be taken into account. If the Chong Customs is abolished rashly, the educational expenses of one million yuan per year will be lost, and tens of thousands of primary and secondary school students will lose their schooling, and the impact will be huge. Chief Zhang has said that he will use the money of the Hebei province to do the affairs of the Hebei province and will not take a penny to the Northeast. However, on the other hand, the Northeast cannot take money to do the affairs of the Hebei province. Chinese people are easily moved by emotions. If the Chong Customs is abolished at the request of the merchants, it will be necessary for the Unified Tax Bureau to collect educational expenses in order to save educational expenses. This is not only a name but also a fact, and those who declare foreign goods account for twelve-twentieths. Once the customs is abolished, foreign goods will reduce the burden, which is tantamount to promoting the sales of imported goods. When our country's customs duties cannot be completely independent, there is no way to make up for this loss. Foreign goods arriving in Beiping only recognize the Chongwenmen Customs and not other tax collection agencies. If the Unified Tax Bureau collects educational expenses, because foreign goods cannot be taxed, domestic goods must be taxed an additional 5% to reach one million yuan of income per year. The merchants' burden is heavy, and domestic goods are subject to a heavy pressure. There is no way to make it worse than this. Now the petition representatives have gone to Shenyang. Chief Zhang has investigated the Chong Customs clearly and must have a method that takes into account both considerations. [ (October 20th)</p>
<p>Revival of the Eastern Railway Telegraph Rights Conference</p>
<p>Continued Discussion of the Public Telegraph and Telephone Issues</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The Eastern Railway Telegraph Rights Conference has been interrupted for a long time. Recently, Li Deyan, representative of the Transportation Committee, and Jian Nisov, representative of the Eastern Railway Bureau, have consulted several times, thinking that the telephone issue is not as important as the telegraph issue, and it is appropriate to continue negotiations on the public telegraph issue, so that the telegraph end can be completely resolved and then proceed with the telephone issue. After the two sides reached a consensus, on the 12th of this month, the Chinese side first proposed an outline of the public telegraph proposal and handed it over to the Russian side for reading. The main points of the outline are: (1) The Eastern Railway allocated a dedicated telegraph line to the South Manchuria Railway Telegraph for management and free use by the Harbin office of the South Manchuria Railway, and the office sent and received commercial telegrams in addition to public use. This encroached on the sovereignty of the Chinese side and affected the income of the Chinese telegraph administration. The Eastern Railway should cancel the contract signed with the South Manchuria Railway. (2) The method of paying for the public telegrams linked from the Eastern Railway line to the Soviet Union should also be re-stipulated. In addition, there are several other important points. After receiving this outline, the Russian side replied on the 14th, listing four reasons, which were quite far-fetched, but there was not much difference in the point of view. The Chinese side allowed the Russian side to convene a special committee meeting on the 15th, which would be decided by the special committee, because there was room for negotiation. The meeting is scheduled to be held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from the 15th until the issue is resolved. Because Jiang Yi was not in Liaoning, only Huang Junke and Li Zhigang attended the Chinese special committee, and the Russian committee was still three people. The telephone issue can be discussed after this issue is resolved. The central government has paid close attention to this matter and has repeatedly telegraphed the Transportation Committee to inquire about the progress. Li Deyan has telegraphed the central government about the progress of the meeting. (18th)</p>
<p>Heilongjiang Province Finance and Transportation</p>
<p>Actively Reorganizing Jiang Paper Money and Extending the Hu-Hai Railway</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Heilongjiang Province Guangxin Company was recently reorganized into an official bank. Previously, the company acted as the provincial treasury, abused the issuance of Jiang paper money and Harbin silver dollars, and operated subsidiary businesses such as oil mills and sugar factories to compete with the people for profit. However, the Jiang paper money and Harbin silver dollars and the subsidiary businesses it operated were intertwined. The more Jiang paper money and Harbin silver dollars were issued, the more wool the subsidiary businesses got, and the more profits they got. Until recent years, the company's foundation has been shaken and the people's credit has been lost. Wan Fulin recognized this relationship as the fundamental plan of Heilongjiang Province and specially appointed Gao Yunkun, director of the Hu-Hai Railway Bureau, as the general manager of Guangxin Official Bank, ordering him to earnestly reorganize it. After taking over, Gao first sealed the Guangxin stamp and printing machines to show his determination to reorganize. At the same time, he investigated the total amount of Jiang paper money issued, which was worth more than 10 million Harbin silver dollars, and 7 million Harbin silver dollars. Then he replaced Jiang paper money with Harbin notes and gradually recovered Jiang paper money worth more than 7 million yuan. However, the money law of Heilongjiang Province has been in a chaotic state for a long time, and it is difficult to recover it overnight. Therefore, recently, eight subsidiary businesses have been cut to avoid competing with the people for profit. Western bookkeeping has been used in the official bank, and a training institute has been set up to recruit students to train bank and company personnel, who will be sent to the 30 branches of the bank to serve in the future in order to thoroughly reform. As for the railway construction in Heilongjiang Province, the Hu-Hai railway is the most developed. Although the entire line is only more than 300 miles long, the total amount of assets has reached more than 30 million. Last year's operating income reached more than 5 million, which is not available to state-owned railways. Now the railway has decided to develop the rich resources of the eastern wilderness of Heilongjiang Province and extend the trunk line to Baiquan to connect with the Qi-Ke Railway to complete the Heilongjiang Railway network. Before this line is built, the branch line to the Hegang coal mine will be built first. This line passes through Qingcheng and Tielu to reach Hegang, with a total length of 800 li. The construction cost must be estimated after the survey. The survey team will set off on the first of next month, but the route must pass through the Neixing'anling and a 200-li vast plain with no inhabitants, and the work is quite difficult, so it is expected that the survey will be completed after six months. After the road is built in the future, the livelihood and reclamation of the people in eastern Heilongjiang Province can be solved. (17th)</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Express</p>

Lu Quan, Magistrate of Jinshan County, resigned due to illness and was approved by the provincial order. The vacancy was filled by Huang Zhewen, appointed by the Civil Affairs Department. The Construction Department yesterday dismissed Zhang Shuyuan, director of the Yangzhou section office of the Grand Canal Engineering Office. The vacancy was filled by Yu Ting, the current chief engineer of the Ning-Hang Road. The second group of the Jiangsu Provincial Winter Defense Conference, consisting of twelve counties including Ning and Zhen, is scheduled to be held in the province on the 28th. Zhenjiang County has drafted the main points of the proposal as follows: (1) The bandits in each township are moving from one place to another. It is proposed to track down and exterminate them at any time to eradicate them. (2) Maoshan has always been a bandit den. It is proposed to station troops there permanently and destroy their lairs. (3) Please break down the county boundaries and implement joint defense. Gu Yinifu, director of the Xinghua Education Bureau, was accused of embezzling public funds. The Education Department previously appointed Qin Fengxiang to go to the county to inquire. Now Mr. Qin has brought all the accounts of Gu's tenure to the province for examination. (25th)</p>

<p>Train Derails in Fushun on Pingji Line</p>
<p>Passengers Claim Highly Suspicious Circumstances, Deeming It a Conspiracy of Sabotage by Others. Through Transportation on the Combined Shenyang-Tongliao, Beining, Shenhai, and Jihai Lines from Beiping to Jilin Commenced on the 10th of This Month. On the Morning of the 11th, the Fourth Through Train from Shenyang to Jilin Derails Immediately Upon Arrival at Fushun Station. Only Two Passenger Cars Derailed, with Just a Few Passengers Sustaining Minor Injuries. After the Railway Authorities Exhausted All Efforts to Rescue the Situation, the Delay Was Extremely Short, and Service Resumed as Normal. However, Newspapers and Correspondents from the Japanese Side in the Provincial Capital Made Great Efforts to Spread Unfavorable Propaganda After the Fact, Claiming That as Many as Six Cars Had Derailed and That Many People Had Been Killed or Injured. In Reality, This Propaganda Served Another Purpose. According to Mr. Someone, a Passenger, the Circumstances of the Derailment Were Roughly as Follows: The Pingji Train, Departing from Beiping, Approached Fushun Station on the Following Day, When Suddenly a Cracking Sound Was Heard, and the Train Body Shook Violently, Leaning to the Right. Passengers in the Train Rolled to One Side with the Train Body. After a Short While, the Train Settled. Passengers Crawled Out of the Broken Windows, and Several Sustained Minor Injuries to Their Heads, Faces, Hands, and Feet. Upon Inspection, It Was Found That the Third Car Was the One That Tipped Over, While the Fourth Car Was Pulled Off the Tracks, Its Front End Sinking into the Mud. The Rear End of the Fourth Car and the Front End of the Fifth Car Were Also Off the Tracks, but Sustained Less Damage. The Sixth Dining Car and the Seventh Baggage Car/Guard Van Remained Firmly on the Tracks. The Second Car in Front Had Become Uncoupled from the Tipped-Over Third Car. The First Car, Along with the Engine, Had Traveled More Than Two Hundred Paces. Except for the Engine, All the Cars Had Derailed, Causing All the Railroad Ties to Be Crushed. However, the Rail on the Left Side Was Not Damaged at All. One Section of the Rail on the Right Side, Directly Under the Third Car, Was Carried Away by the Car and Bent into an Arc. The Section Connecting the Front of This Section Was Slightly Bent Inward. The Place Where the Two Sections Joined Was Not Damaged at All, and the Iron Splints Used to Connect the Two Sections Were Still Intact. However, the Four Screws Used to Fasten the Rail to the Railroad Ties Were Missing. In Investigating the Reasons for the Derailment, One Possibility Is That the Track at That Location Was Too Severely Curved. The Beining Train Car Was Heavier, and the Shenhai Track Was Weaker, So It Was Possible That It Was Crushed Outward by the Wheels at the Turn, Causing It to Tip Over. However, If the Track Was Unable to Withstand the Weight and Came Out of Position, the Break Should Have Had Significant Scratches. But the Place Where the Two Rails Separated Was Not Damaged at All. Another Theory Is That the Railroad Ties Were Rotten and the Spikes Came Loose, Causing the Rail to Move. It Is True That the Railroad Ties Were Decayed, but the Key Point of This Derailment Was That the Rail Shifted, Not That the Railroad Ties Sank. The Key Is Still That the Iron Splints Came Loose from the Rail for No Reason, Causing the Two Rails to Lose Their Connection. When the Train Ran Over It, One Rail Poked Outward, Causing the Train to Tip Over. The Reason Why the Iron Splints Became Detached from the Rail Is a Matter of Great Worth for Investigation. This Is Because If They Came Loose When the Two Rails Broke Apart, They Would Certainly Have Been Broken or Damaged. Even If They Were Broken After Being Fastened to the Rail with Screws, They Would Still Have Been Attached to the Rail. Now, However, They Are Not Damaged at All and Are Still in Their Original Place. It Must Have Been Sabotage by Someone Familiar with This Type of Work, So That This Newly Started Business Would Suffer a Loss of Credibility, While They Would Indirectly Receive the Benefits. The Location Where the Incident Occurred Was Outside Fushun Station, No More Than a Hundred Yards from Yangqi. Passengers Carried Their Baggage and Rushed to Fushun Station. Later, Passenger Cars Were Called from the Shenhai Line in Chaoyang Town to Send the Passengers East. Those Who Did Not Wish to Go Were Allowed to Return Their Tickets. In Addition to Feeling Frightened, Mr. Someone Was Overcome with Grief and Indignation. He Intended to Return to Shenyang and Went to the Fushun Branch Station of the South Manchuria Railway to Purchase a Ticket with Silver Dollars, but Was Refused. He Was Told That He Could Only Purchase Tickets with Japanese Yen. Mr. Someone Went to a Small Shop in the Station and Exchanged Two Silver Dollars for One Japanese Yen Before He Could Purchase a Ticket and Board the Train. The Day After He Arrived in Shenyang, He Heard That the Rail Had Already Been Repaired and That the Pingji Train Was Operating as Normal. Gao Jiyi, Chairman of the Northeast Transportation Committee, Upon Hearing the News, Returned to Shenyang to Investigate the Cause and Circumstances of the Train Derailment and to Study Proper Methods to Ensure the Safety of Railway Operations and Passengers in the Future.

However, After the Apprentice Arrived in Qingpu, There Was No Rice on the Market. Daring Not Return to Songjiang Empty-Handed, He Went to Chonggu Town and Purchased a Boatload of Rough Rice at Twelve Dollars and Ten Cents Per Stone. However, Rice Prices Had Fallen in Recent Days, So the Master Blamed the Apprentice for the Ten-Cent Difference and Severely Beat Him, Ordering Him to Kneel on a Money Board While Burning a Stick of Incense.

Yesterday, It Sent a Representative to Email Chairman Chiang, Requesting That He Send a Heavy Army to Encircle and Suppress the Fierce Bandits. The Original Email Roughly Said: In Our City, Green Forests Have Been Rampant for Several Months, and Bandits Are Everywhere. Incidents of Kidnapping and Robbery Occur Almost Every Day. The Situation Is Unbearable, Such as in Villages Near the Ling Area Border West of Shanyuan and Liuzhao. In Other Places, Such as Zhou Village in Changshou, Bai Village in Jinji, Cilin in Huxiao and Liuqin Xiao, Yin Family in Zhongyi, and Fangmen in Songlin, All Reported Kidnappings to the County.

Our City Originally Had Two Hundred Guards, but They Are Divided Into Key Defenses, and I Am Afraid That It Will Be Difficult to Drive Straight In and Wipe Out One Share. In Particular, I Wish to Describe the Situation of the Banditry, Requesting That a Strong Military Force of One Thousand People Be Sent Soon to Distribute in Fenghua, Xinchang, Shengxian, and Ninghai to Encircle and Suppress the Bandits, End the Banditry, and Relieve the People's Lives.

<p>Wuyuan Raided by Yan Bandits: Since Fang Zhimin's Red Army Twice Fell Into Jingzhen as a Base, the Nan Suobiao Red Army Has Long Wanted to Invade Wuyuan. Fortunately, Major Villages and Towns in the West Township, Such as Fuchun Chongtian, Changxi, and Dayoushan, Jointly Defended and Did Not Dare to Go Deep. The Other Month, the Bandits Sent People to Zhangshuting and Huchuan, Two Villages Bordering Fujiang, to Publicize and Order Them to Surrender. The Villagers Refused. This Time, the Suobiao Team Came to Huchuan Village With Guns and Forced Them to Join (The Village Is Only About Five Li From Fujiang. The Population of About 100 Households Is an Important Route That Wuyuan Must Pass Through Like Jing), or the Chickens and Dogs Will Not Be Spared. Ordinary Vagrants and Local Ruffians in the Village Agreed to Erect a Red Flag and Join Under the Threat of Bandits. The Remaining Honest Merchants Were Forced by the Bandits and Did Not Dare to Resist. The Neighboring Village of Paoquan Heard About This (Three Li From Hu) and Quickly Reported to the Fuchun Group Defense Officer in the Western District, Who Sent People to Tell the Village to Remove the Red Flag and Resist to the Death. Most People in the Village Agreed With This Righteousness. In Addition to Jointly Protecting the Neighboring Villages on One Side, They Reported the Details to the County Government and the People's Self-Defense Corps for Assistance. The Bandits Learned That the Village Had Removed the Red Flag and Thought It Was a Trick. The Day Before Yesterday (the Fifteenth), Dozens of Suobiaos Rushed Into the Village and Set Fire. More Than One Hundred Households in the Entire Village Were Burned Down and More Than Ten Families Were Burned Down. The Bandits Then Retreated. Then, Hundreds of Suobiaoes Came Again With Guns and Wanted to Massacre the Villagers. The Villagers Hurriedly Ran to Paoquan and Asked for Help From the Zi Nantuan. Just as the Team Rushed to the Head of Huchuan Village, They Saw That the Banditry Was Great and Fired Their Guns Into the Fire. The Two Sides Fought for Several Hours, Killing More Than Thirty Bandits on the Spot. The Bandits Were Overwhelmed and Retreated to the Carp Bridge in Fujiang. The Self-Defense Corps Was Short of People (Thirty People) and Lacked Ammunition. In Addition to Flying to the County Government for Assistance, They Told the Villagers to Help With Considerable Strength. The Village Authorities Were Concerned With the Survival of Neighboring Villages, So They Beat the Gongs and Opened the Ancestral Hall. All Men Over the Age of Fifteen Had to Bring Their Weapons to the Enemy to Cooperate With the Self-Defense Corps to Defend Themselves. At This Point, the Sound and Might Were Greatly Increased. The County Government Received the Alert This Morning and Sent More Teams Led by Xia Yumo to Assist in the Attack. The Seventh District Bandit Suppression Commander of the Provincial Army, Tang Brigade Commander of the Independent Lost Object Brigade, Emailed the County Government Yesterday, Saying That This Ministry Could Reach Wuyuan Before Qingyang Hao Ri (the Twentieth).

<p>Provisional Military Government Established Leader Casto Elected Dissolution of Congress, Release of Political Prisoners President Louis Imprisoned in Infantry Barracks Berlin Dispatch on the 24th: A telegram from the Brazilian capital reports that the revolution in the country has taken a sharp turn, the government has fallen, and President Louis has resigned. General Casto is now forming a provisional government. This coup was planned within the capital. General Casto, known as a supporter of the government, suddenly sent an ultimatum to the government, demanding that President Louis abdicate to quell internal strife, with a deadline of 10:00 AM. Seeing that the military's loyalty had completely changed, the president signed his resignation at 9:40 AM. Thereupon, the military cadets and the navy immediately declared their support for General Casto as leader, and the coup was accomplished without bloodshed. The news spread throughout the country, and there were celebratory parades everywhere. The new government's first act was to dissolve Congress. Soon after, former President Louis was arrested and imprisoned in an infantry barracks, but it is said that his life is not in danger. The news of the Brazilian coup had a positive impact on the London Stock Exchange, and Brazilian bonds rose by three pounds. Reuters, 25th, Brazilian Capital: President Louis is currently detained in a certain fort, and former cabinet members are being held in the palace. Louis strongly refused to sign the resignation document. The provisional military government was formed by two army generals, one navy admiral, and one doctor, and is exercising dictatorial powers. They are in talks with representatives from the states that launched the uprising. The state of Sao Paulo has declared revolution, and officials there fled upon hearing of President Louis's downfall. Reuters, 25th, New York: According to sources in the Brazilian capital, there are three major figures in this revolution: General Vargas, commander-in-chief of the Southern Revolutionary Army; Dr. Aranha, acting governor of the State of Rio Grande do Sul; and Captain Tavora, commander of the Northern Revolutionary Army. As the three do not see eye to eye, Brazil may yet face bloodshed. Reuters, 24th, Brazilian Capital: The military government has dissolved Congress and the Supreme Court. The Minister of War and the Deputy Speaker of the Senate have been arrested. Presidential candidate Dr. Plaisde has fled by airplane. All political prisoners have been released. The masses are still marching in the streets, but there have been no riots. It is reported that the plot to overthrow the government was decided at a meeting of military leaders at night. The Minister of War, aware of this, urgently summoned General Casto, commander of the fort, for questioning, but Casto did not go but instead went to the various forts to make arrangements. He then sought the approval of the Navy. At 2:00 AM, a final agreement was reached, and an ultimatum was drafted and sent to President Louis, ending the life of the government. Several places in the Brazilian capital caught fire, as the newspapers that supported the government were burned by the angry masses. Demonstrators carried red flags, and the police did not interfere. Residents of Pernambuco were ecstatic upon hearing the news of the government's overthrow, and all the churches rang their bells as the masses cheered "Long live the army!" In the afternoon, the situation in the Brazilian capital deteriorated slightly. Jornal do Brasil, one of the most famous newspapers in the country, was also destroyed by the mob. Reuters, 25th, Washington: The U.S. government had just decided last week to ship munitions to Brazil to support the Brazilian government. Now that the situation has changed drastically, the report from the U.S. ambassador in the Brazilian capital is receiving much attention. The U.S. ambassador stated that the military government is composed of five long-serving, responsible military officers. The masses are jubilant, and the red flag is a symbol of revolution, not of communism. Associated Press, 24th, Washington: Today, someone inquired with officials at the State Department about the status of the new Brazilian government. The State Department declined to say whether the United States would recognize the government, but the United States has successively recognized the governments of Argentina, Peru, and Bolivia. It is said that if Secretary of State Stimson determines that the new Brazilian government in Brazil is indeed capable of fulfilling its international responsibilities, it may soon be recognized. On the other hand, it is believed that the U.S. government is still hesitant to grant formal recognition to the various South American countries. This is based on the views of Houston.</p>
<p>Reuters, 25th, Berlin: The Hapag-Lloyd ship Baden (8,803 tons), arriving from the Brazilian capital, telegraphed that it was hit by artillery fire from the fort yesterday, killing and injuring 18 passengers, mostly Spaniards from Argentina.

The Brazilian government hopes to resolve this regrettable incident amicably. Political Assassination Occurs in Chinese Enclave in Manila</p>
<p>Six Kuomintang Members Stabbed The violence had just subsided when a major fire broke out. Manila, 24th (Kuomin News Agency): Following a major riot in a thoroughfare of the Chinese enclave in Manila, six members of the Kuomintang were stabbed and sent to the hospital. The violence had just subsided when a major fire broke out. Two Chinese cigarette factories were tragically burned down, with estimated losses exceeding 500,000 Philippine pesos. It is said that someone set the fire. Police officials suspect that the unrest was incited by communists, but they dare not make a hasty judgment due to the lack of reliable evidence. On the other hand, it is believed to be the result of local feuds or business jealousy. It is also reported that the owner of one cigarette factory was stabbed before the fire broke out. Reuters, 25th, Manila: Last night, Chinese communists attacked Kuomintang officials here, stabbing six people, two of whom are in critical condition. One is Gan Buxiang (transliteration), the owner of the largest cigarette factory here, and the other is Ou Zhuangsheng (transliteration), a school principal, both Kuomintang leaders. It was initially thought to be factional strife, but it is now clear that it was purely political assassination, as threatening letters had been received in advance. Police are patrolling strictly in the Chinese residential areas to prevent further unrest. Paraguay</p>

Reuters, 24th, Pretoria, South Africa: General Smuts, who was a member of the British Imperial War Cabinet at the time of the Balfour Declaration, has telegraphed British Prime Minister MacDonald expressing his great dissatisfaction with the government's decision on Palestine, stating that the Balfour Declaration is an obligation tied to honor and must be fully fulfilled regardless of the cost.

At 7:30 PM, a major clash occurred with 500 police officers, with both sides throwing stones and fighting. As a result, traffic was cut off and businesses closed. The Kameido area was like a battlefield, turning into a scene of carnage. More than 60 people were injured, and 150 were arrested. As a result, the Joto tramway was closed. Police Chief Maruyama personally came forward, and as a result, the dispute group was dispersed by the police, bringing the curtain down on the tragic and chaotic fighting. However, the dispute group has made contact with a secret mobile headquarters, and there is a high risk that the country will launch another dangerous action.

<p>The Future of the Metalworkers' Strike is Uncertain National News Agency, 24th, Berlin: The German government has decided to reduce the salaries of cabinet members by 20% starting on the first of next month in order to rigorously economize on national expenditures. According to the government's fiscal plan, the salary cuts for cabinet members were originally scheduled to be implemented on April 1st of next year. Now, in order to reduce government spending and set an example, they are being implemented earlier. Furthermore, since this measure does not affect anyone other than cabinet members, it does not need to be submitted to parliament for approval in advance. National News Agency, 24th, Berlin: The German political and economic circles are quite worried about the future of the metalworkers' strike. Mediation negotiations must be continued on Monday, as the Minister of Labor has gone to Ahlen to personally attend the funeral of the victims of the coal mine explosion. It is widely rumored that metalworkers across the country will follow suit and go on strike. Although the government's official newspaper is making every effort to dispel the rumors, the wage contracts of metalworkers in Berlin and other places will expire at the end of this month. If the Berlin strike is not resolved by then, it will be difficult to prevent it from spreading to other cities.</p>

British Proposal to Abolish Wreath-Laying at Tomb of the Unknown Soldier</p>
<p>Great Outrage in Belgium Public Opinion German Government Expresses Welcome Reuters, 24th, Brussels: The Belgian press is greatly outraged by the British government's proposal to stop placing wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, stating that even if the British Labour government does not commemorate them, other countries do. MacDonald is free to not commemorate Belgium's fallen, but Belgians have no reason to abandon their obligation to place wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Britain.</p>
<p>Reuters, 24th, Berlin: The Berlin newspapers did not criticize the British proposal to no longer place wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, only headlining it with things like "Eliminating the Roots of Hatred." The government expressed its welcome to the proposal, believing it to be a step toward healing the wounds of war and encouraging a new era of peace, and hoping that other countries that were once enemies of Germany, whether they have a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier or not, will now follow Britain's example. Reuters, 25th, London: Since the British Foreign Office proposed to stop the practice of laying wreaths at the Arc de Triomphe or Tomb of the Unknown Soldier when officially visiting capital cities of various countries, British veterans' organizations have strongly opposed the proposal. According to news from New York, veterans' organizations in the United States also disapprove. The U.S. State Department has received the British proposal but does not want to criticize it. Major U.S. newspapers have also not commented.</p>

<p>Accepts Freedom of Kaiserslautern Reuters, 24th, London: Foreign Secretary Henderson, while accepting the Freedom of Kaiserslautern today, recalled the peaceful trend of British foreign policy in recent years, stating that Britain's signing of the optional clause in the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, recognizing the submission of disputes to the court for adjudication, is evidence of the peaceful trend. The government is currently discussing with representatives of overseas self-governing territories whether it is possible to go further and accept a convention that all international disputes must be resolved peacefully. If this convention is unanimously recognized, then an era of arbitration will replace the era of resolving disputes by force.</p>

Since President Zhang took office three years ago, the development of education at Central University has been rapidly improving.

<p>Students Oppose the Establishment of a General Affairs Office. People Making Suggestions for Improving University Affairs, Tu Juyou, etc., Insist on the Original Proposal and Request the University Authorities to Terminate the Establishment of the General Affairs Office, Stating in Substance: Juyou, etc., previously considered that Secretary-General Zhang Zuoshi's monopoly on university administration originated from the excessive authority of the Secretariat. Therefore, they requested the abolition of the Secretariat to eliminate the source of trouble. Unexpectedly, the university authorities, after receiving this suggestion, abolished all three offices and established a General Affairs Office to oversee everything. The original five groups of registration, documents, publication, accounting, and general affairs (as well as the library and medical office), which were under the three offices, are now all under the General Affairs Office. Such a reorganization not only greatly contradicts Juyou's original intention to request improvement but also seriously violates the regulations of the Ministry of Education. The resulting drawbacks will be endless. They petition for the termination of the proposal and hope that all teachers and students will unite to strive for and insist on the original proposal. Statement by Bingwen, Dean of the College of Agriculture at Central University Regarding the suggestions for improving university affairs made by students Xu Zicheng, etc., involved his personal matters. Yesterday, he specially sent a letter to Zhang Naiyan, stating in the original letter: "President Junmou, respectfully: I have recently read in the Education News column of the Shen Bao that Central University students Xu Zicheng, etc., wrote to the president continuing the spirit of Tu Juyou and putting forward 18 proposals. The fifth proposal states 'Thoroughly investigate the nationalist faction Bingwen,' which I find deeply surprising. Since Bingwen returned to China in the fifth year of the Republic after studying agriculture in the United States, his duties have changed, but all his work has been related to agriculture. He has always devoted his heart and soul to agriculture in order to live up to the country, society, and his studies. As for politics, since it is not what he aspires to or has studied, he has never had any kind of advocacy, let alone any kind of faction. He has never falsely accused others in his life, nor does he wish to be falsely accused by others. Please publish this letter in the university newspaper to clarify the truth. I wish you good health. Sincerely, Zou Bingwen" General Situation of Education in Yancheng County</p>
<p>Joint Office for the Preparation of Compulsory Education in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province. Local Education Investigator Jin Yingyuan has investigated the education in Taixian, Xinghua, and Dongtai counties and is now investigating the general situation of education in Yancheng as follows: Education in Yancheng County has always been known for its development, but after the great famine of the 17th and 18th years of the Republic, its vitality was greatly damaged. This year, it has suffered again from banditry. Except for the urban area, the entire county has fallen into the hands of bandits. Wherever the bandits went, nine out of ten houses were empty. Plunder, arson, and killing were rampant. The severity of the suffering has never been seen before. The losses in the entire county are said to be over 20 million yuan, and the losses in education, such as the burning of school buildings, the scattering of school equipment, and the advance collection of school rent, are also significant. Currently, only the urban area and the north and south coasts of Wuyou and other places have opened schools, while the rest are closed. Arrears of educational funds have been owed for nine months. The schools that have opened in the urban area have been teaching for nearly three months, and the amount of money received has been at most 200 yuan and at least 70 or 80 yuan. However, the principals and teachers of the schools are still encouraging the spirit and not discouraged. Director Liu Chengyun took over the position in February of this year when things were difficult. In August, he had no rice to cook and had to maintain the budget for the 19th year. New projects added during the revision include nine primary schools, seven junior elementary complete primary schools, and one female department of the county high school. The urban schools, such as the county high school, the construction of the women's department's building, the classrooms, the vocational high school, the experimental elementary school, the city primary school, and the Doushuai Temple Elementary School, have all been renovated. In addition, the reorganization work includes the reorganization of various city and township education fund collection offices in terms of general affairs, prohibiting elementary schools from interfering in donations, and evenly distributing education funds. Regarding school education, the county experimental elementary school has been reorganized, the city and township schools have been reorganized, and statistical tables for schools at all levels have been compiled. Regarding social education, the public education halls have been reorganized. The plans for the future emphasize strict budgeting and the reorganization of land rent. All of these are essential matters that need to be handled in the county's education. (1) Funding The estimated income for the 19th year is 184,334 yuan for surtaxes and small taxes, 10,327 yuan for miscellaneous taxes and surtaxes, 10,434 yuan for special donations, 91,443 yuan for miscellaneous donations, 23,370 yuan for property, and 16,640 yuan for tuition fees, totaling 336,548 yuan. The expenditures are 18,312 yuan for educational administration fees, 62,175 yuan for ordinary education, 140,054 yuan for compulsory education, and 42,045 yuan for social education. The special income is 14,469 yuan, and the expenditures are the same. The original management method of the city and township education funds was to establish a city and township education fund collection director. After Director Liu took office, he reformed the collection office in many ways, such as reforming the joint form system, prohibiting private printing of donation strips, ordering monthly reporting of income and expenditure accounts and joint form inspections, and prohibiting the disposal of school property. The old malpractices are gradually changing. (2) Compulsory Education The entire county is divided into seven school districts with a population of 1,086,351. Of the school-age children, 29,825 have enrolled and 87,744 have not enrolled. There are 440 primary schools with a total of 527 classes, costing 118,942 yuan. Future promotion Regarding the training of teachers, the women's school in the county does not have a normal school department, and elementary school graduates are recruited for three years of normal school training. Rescue methods 1. Implement private school registration starting this year. 2. Pilot compulsory education experimental areas and then expand to the entire county. The current compulsory education funds are used for the reorganization of old projects (130,054 yuan) and for new projects (10,000 yuan). There are 207 teachers in the county who graduated from normal school undergraduate and high school normal school, 148 with three years of normal school training, 343 with two years of normal school training, 19 rural teachers, 10 normal school special course teachers, 63 high school graduates, 36 qualified upon examination, and 9 unqualified. It is found that the situation of elementary education in the county is still sufficient for teachers. The future promotion should cultivate rural normal school talents to develop rural education. (3) Ordinary Education There is one county high school, with four classes in the main campus and five classes in the women's department (with a normal school class). There is one county vocational high school with three classes of students. There are four private junior high schools (Tinghu, Qunying, Jinglu, and Shihua), each with three classes. Qunying Junior High School also has one class for women. There are 10 county complete primary schools with 22 classes, 25 district schools with 30 classes, and 3 private schools with 4 classes, totaling 56 classes with 2,000 students and 113 teachers and staff. In the 18th year, 1,024 children graduated, and half of them went on to further education. In addition, there is one workers' primary school funded by worker donations. (4) Social Education There is a public education hall in the city with Director Ma Pengfei and 7 staff members, with a monthly expenditure of 196 yuan. It has already established industries such as reading rooms, entertainment rooms, specimen rooms, and mobile lectures. The daily display and collection are particularly rich and have a close relationship with the promotion of domestic goods. The farmers' education hall is located at the Haishen Temple outside the east gate, with Director Jiang Bin and 4 staff members, with an annual fee of 1,819 yuan. The public schools will be established soon. The county-run Shuotao Library was built with donations from the Qi family Shuotao and is extremely magnificent. The sports field is vast, and the park area is particularly large with lush trees and flowers. In addition, there are 5 reading rooms and 1 reading room at Dagaogang. The Education Bureau is running a public school class in the public education hall. It is found that the old system in Yancheng has 25 cities and townships with a vast territory. Towns such as Shagou, Hu, Wuyou, Gangmen, Dagaogang, Jianyang, Anfeng, and Shanggang all have more than thousands of households. The promotion of social education cannot be delayed.

<p>Explanation of the Re-election Period for Education Associations</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a report from the Jiangsu Education Bureau concerning a request for interpretation from the Yangzhong County Education Association regarding the starting period for its re-election, has issued the following directive to the Jiangsu Education Bureau: The next re-election should be calculated from the date of the Executive Committee's assumption of office until the completion of a one-year term.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education states: Upon review, the organization of a group requires the establishment of bylaws and the proper selection of officers before it can be considered officially established. Although the Yangzhong County Education Association prepared for reorganization last October, convened a membership meeting, and elected an Executive Committee, the elected committee members' assumption of office was delayed until February 12th of this year due to doubts and interpretations surrounding the election. Therefore, the county's Education Association can only be considered officially established on the date the committee members assumed office. The next re-election should also be calculated from the date of the committee members' assumption of office until the completion of a one-year term. You are instructed to take note and instruct others to comply.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Cables Peking University Clarifying That the President Cannot Hold Concurrent Positions</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education received a telegram from faculty and staff of National Peking University requesting the retention of Cai Yuanpei and the interim president, Chen, to continue in their positions until Cai's return to the university. The Ministry recently telegraphed the school, stating: To the faculty and staff of National Peking University in Beiping, your telegram has been received. The matter of a university president not holding concurrent positions is a crucial step in reforming university education. This has long been stipulated in the University Organization Law. To ensure the implementation of this matter, the National Government has approved the resignations or dismissed the presidents of various universities. Mr. Cai himself has been permitted to resign from the presidency due to the importance of his position as a member of the National Government. There is no way to retain him. Interim President Chen's request to resign has been repeatedly met with telegrams of consolation and encouragement. It is hoped that you will all earnestly persuade him to stay.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education's stance has further hardened the attitude of university students.</p>
<p>(Tokyo, 25th Dispatch) The attitude of Waseda University students has become increasingly firm. Yesterday, they established a unified headquarters to direct various departments including accounting, negotiation, security, publicity, and intelligence, consolidating their efforts to address the three demands made to the school authorities, stating, "Reckless demands for meetings will be resolutely rejected."</p>

<p>Fifteenth Anniversary of the Science Society of China</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the fifteenth anniversary of the founding of the Science Society of China. Coinciding with the completion of the Society's new Mingfu Library, the society invited local members to hold the fifteenth-anniversary celebration at the Mingfu Library at 3:00 PM. Over one hundred members attended, including Cai Ziming, Yang Xingfu, Zhou Zijing, Cao Liangxia, Yang Yuanzhong, and Wang Jiliang, creating a lively atmosphere. First, Cao Liangxia, president of the Shanghai Society of Friends, delivered an opening address, stating that Confucius at fifteen aspired to learning, and the Science Society, since its inception in Ithaca, has now reached the age of Confucius's aspiration for learning. Now that the Mingfu Library is completed, this fifteen-year-old can focus on studying. Cai Ziming then gave a speech, noting that China lacks specialized scientific organizations as research institutions. The Science Society has a fifteen-year history, with a diverse membership. It should be divided into small groups based on various specialties as a foundation for future specialized research institutions. Yang Xingfu spoke next, saying that it is gratifying that the Science Society, which was initially founded in a small house in Ithaca, is now holding its anniversary celebration in its own Mingfu Library after fifteen years. However, what is gratifying is not the size of the building but the spirit, especially the spirit of play, because it is this spirit that allows them to face dangers without fear, and it is this spirit that allows them to continue to struggle and strive for progress even when facing setbacks without feeling pain. He hoped that the Science Society would maintain this spirit and achieve even greater success in the future. He believed that any research, no matter the field, requires a playful spirit to foster interest and achieve success. Wang Jiliang then delivered a humorous and eclectic speech, stating that academic research requires the strength of an ox, the vigilance of a dog, and the tranquility of a pig to be successful.</p>
<p>After the speeches, which lasted until past 5:00 PM, Western-style refreshments were served, followed by Peking opera and music. The meeting concluded around 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Sixth Academic Lecture by the Vocational Education Society</p>
<p>The China Vocational Education Society held its sixth academic lecture on education yesterday. Xu Peihuang, a member of the municipal government and director of the Municipal Bureau of Education, was invited to give a special lecture. Over one hundred people attended, starting at 2:00 PM. Yang Weiyu, the chairman, first gave a report and introduction. Xu's lecture was titled "Cooperation Between Universities, Middle Schools, and Worker Education," providing a detailed analysis of the issue.</p>
<p>Shanghai University Honors Students</p>
<p>Each academic year, Shanghai University in Yangshupu selects students with excellent grades from each level to be named honor students and holds an honors ceremony on a designated day. The aim is to encourage students to work hard and learn from each other, a well-established practice with significant results. This year's ceremony was held in the auditorium at 11:00 AM yesterday. All faculty, staff, and students attended. First, the school song was sung, followed by a speech by President Liu. Then, Director Fan of the Academic Affairs Office called out the names and awarded certificates. Dr. Frank Rawlinson delivered an encouraging and moving speech. Many students were listed as recipients of the awards.</p>
<p>Tenth Anniversary Celebration and New School Building Opening Ceremony of Liangjiang Girls' Physical Education School</p>
<p>Since the completion of the new school buildings of the Liangjiang Girls' Physical Education School on Daji Road, the opening ceremony has yet to be held, and guests from all walks of life have been invited to visit the site. After preliminary arrangements, preparations continued for the school's reopening. Taking advantage of the pleasant autumn weather, it is planned to formally hold the opening ceremony. This year also marks the school's tenth anniversary, and faculty and students plan to hold a grand carnival to celebrate, including (1) a sports meet and (2) a carnival. A preparatory committee is currently being organized to oversee these activities, which will be held in stages around November 20th. The scale will be grand, and the organization will be precise. The opening ceremony will be held at the school's new buildings, and the location for the sports meet will be determined soon. The performances will be divided into track and field events and national gymnastics. The tenth-anniversary carnival will be held at a well-known cinema in Shanghai, with performances on three separate days, each with unique and exciting programs. The preparatory committee is using a collaborative approach between teachers and students, dividing into groups, and after another joint meeting, the performance outline can be formally finalized.</p>

<p>Zhenru Wins 4-0 Against Lehua</p>
<p>Zhenru Has Well-Rounded Talent</p>
<p>Zhenru (i.e., Jinan University) and Lehua were originally one family, with close ties. Now, they have gone their separate ways. In the Westerners' Football League, there are now two teams standing side by side. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the two teams met on the China Baseball Field for a Westerners' League Group A match. Zhenru had well-rounded talent and strong strength, and ultimately won 4-0.</p>
<p>Referee: Li Silian</p>
<p>Zhenru Team:</p>
<p>Lin Songfa Chen Bingxiang</p>
<p>Feng Yunyou Zhang Rongwen Liang Guanlian Chen Zhenhe Dai Linjing Jiang Shanjing Chen Jiaqiu Zhuang Shihong Mei Hongbao</p>
<p>Lehua Team:</p>
<p>Wang Jihuai Yang Renwei Li Ning Li Huitang Lu Zhongen Liang Guansong Yu Shunzhang An Yuansheng Sun Xingyan Jin Fengde Xi Qiaosheng</p>
<p>(1) A Family Shows Courtesy Before Engaging in Conflict</p>
<p>Many of the players on the Zhenru and Lehua teams have lived together for a long time, and their relationship is deep. Although they are now competing against each other as if they were enemies, they still shake hands warmly and greet each other like family when they meet face to face. Observers believe that showing courtesy before engaging in conflict is truly not in vain.</p>
<p>(2) Veteran Liang Guansong Takes the Field</p>
<p>After the whistle blew, we saw Liang Guansong, who had not served Lehua for a long time, take the field. Liang was once a mainstay of Lehua's team. Time flies, and Liang stepped aside to give way to younger players. Now, Lehua is unfortunately scattered, and Liang, not willing to accept old age, stepped forward. In the first ten minutes, he managed to deflect a dangerous ball, a commemorative achievement in Liang's comeback. Since the start of the match, Chen Bingxiang passed from the left to the center, Lu Zhongen cleared the danger, Dai Linjing followed up, and Lu saved again. Zhenru advanced three times, and Lu, surrounded by enemies, could not handle everything. Chen Jiaqiu took the opportunity to shoot, but fortunately Liang Guansong guarded the goal and fell to the ground to block it, escaping from death and creating a great achievement, worthy of his veteran skills.</p>
<p>(3) Fierce Zhenru Overwhelms Lehua</p>
<p>Zhenru's momentum was overwhelming. The Lehua area was almost occupied by the team. They attacked from the left and right, advancing and following up. Lehua was able to maintain half of the field thanks to Li Ning and Lu Zhongen. Li Huitang, who was in a key position in the front, occasionally counterattacked but did not succeed. Once, Lehua took advantage of the opponent's emptiness and passed each other to invade. Xi Qiaosheng passed to Li, who headed the ball, but Liang Guanlian caught it. Soon after, Li dribbled the ball forward and fell to the ground, but his shot was blocked. Yang Renwei passed to the center, but no one received it, and the opportunity was lost. Zhenru's large team then drove straight in and launched a fierce attack.</p>
<p>(4) Changing Strategies Helps Zhenru Escape</p>
<p>Zhenru's five forwards had excellent coordination, so their footprints were always within 20-30 yards of the goal. However, their shots lacked power and variation, and Lu Zhongen's goalkeeping was impenetrable, resulting in wasted efforts. Suddenly, the strategy changed. Dai passed from the left to the center, and Chen Jiaqiu feigned an attack, but secretly stepped aside to let Mei Hongbao advance like an arrow and score. Lu was focused on Chen and had no time to attend to Mei, resulting in a loss. The time was 3:25 PM. Fifteen minutes later, Zhenru continued to use the same tactic. Chen Bingxiang passed to the center, Dai confused the audience, leaned forward, and Chen Jiaqiu headed the ball into the net. Zhenru then won the first half 2-0. Li Huitang was isolated and helpless.</p>
<p>(5) Mei Hongbao Free and Unrestrained</p>
<p>Lehua's Liang Guansong was tired and weak, so he retreated to become an inner defender. The forwards Sun and Xi switched positions, and the rest of the team remained unchanged. After playing for a long time, Xi and Sun suddenly coordinated and broke through several barriers. One ball was passed over the inner defender, and Li Huitang was in the way. He sped forward, but Jiang Shanjing chased from the side to block his foot. At the same time, Zhenru's counterattack mostly came from the right wing, because Lehua's left forward, Wang Jihuai, was no match for Mei Hongbao. Mei was free and unrestrained, as if he were in an uninhabited area. At 4:15 PM, Mei advanced on the right and passed to the center. Zhang Rongwen followed the momentum and kicked the ball straight into the net. Five minutes later, Chen Jiaqiu passed the ball in front of the goal again. There was no one next to Mei, so he headed the ball in. Zhenru then won 4-0.</p>
<p>(6) Li Huitang Isolated and Helpless</p>
<p>Lehua's being overwhelmed by Zhenru was expected. The weakest point was the center defense line, which could not attack or defend, causing Lehua's inside and outside to be completely disconnected. The famous left and right forwards, Li Huitang, were isolated and helpless, and their repeated advances were ineffective. Finally, with a score of 0-4, Li still fought like a trapped beast, single-handedly penetrating the enemy's lines. Jiang Shanjing closely followed him, hindering his progress. However, Li relied on his agility and still managed to pass to the center. Zhenru's interior was empty, so Sun Xingyan took the opportunity to attack, but he was too hasty and fell to the ground. Afterwards, Li gave Yang Renwei a chance to shoot, but Yang missed the opportunity, resulting in great disappointment. Thus, Lehua suffered an unprecedented defeat.</p>
<p>(7) Assessing the Art, Each Has Their Merits</p>
<p>Both sides have their own specialties. Lu's goalkeeping skills have returned to their former glory. The inner defender Feng Yunyou and Li Ning are solid and reliable. Jiang Shanjing is also able to advance and retreat as desired. Chen Zhenhe and Sun Enjing can be considered equals in the center. Among the forwards, Li Huitang and Dai Linjing are the best. Zhenru's two wings were able to do as they pleased because the opponent's forwards were not good. As a team, Lehua is not as stable as Zhenru, but it has made progress compared to the last time. The forwards are still disorganized, and it is still difficult to achieve lively and agile work like yesterday's Zhenru. However, its future still has hope for improvement.</p>

<p>Invites Jinan Football Team to Compete</p>
<p>Chen Zhang'e, director of the Physical Education Department of National Jinan University, received a letter yesterday from Dr. RRYlanan, Secretary-General of the Philippine Athletic Association, inviting the Jinan football and basketball teams to participate in this year's Charity Games in November or the National Games of the Carnival from January 31st to February 15th next year. The association will be responsible for travel expenses and all other costs. Chen has lived in the Philippines for a long time and is very familiar with the situation there. This event is sure to be successful. As in the past, when overseas Chinese in the Philippines invited the Hong Kong University football team and the Fudan University football teams from Shanghai to compete in the Philippines, Chen and Lin Zhuguang were the driving forces behind the effort. It is said that the school's team has long had the intention to tour, and this invitation from the Philippines will make it easier to do so. However, this matter still needs to be discussed at a meeting before a final decision can be made.</p>

<p>Philippine and Japanese Basketball Teams to Shanghai</p>
<p>Japanese Football Team Also Invited</p>
<p>The Shanghai China Sports Referees Association, in view of the failure of our country's basketball team at this year's Far Eastern Games, and to promote national attention and increase skills, recently plans to invite basketball teams from Japan and the Philippines to Shanghai to compete, and has obtained the support of the China National Amateur Athletic Federation. It has already sent letters to Japan and various organizations to negotiate. It is expected that a reply will be received soon. Once the Japanese reply is received, a letter will be sent to the Philippines inviting its team to Shanghai. China will select skilled athletes to form a strong team to compete with Japan and the Philippines, and plans to invite foreign basketball teams from Shanghai to participate. All matches will be held in the China Basketball Hall. If successful, the competition of the three countries' elite teams in Shanghai will surely arouse great interest among the people. In addition, the Japanese football team, which has consistently finished last in the Far Eastern Games, was surprisingly able to defeat the Philippines and draw with China, sharing the championship, which is quite surprising. Therefore, there is also a proposal to invite them to Shanghai to compete and see their results.</p>

<p>Lehua to Face Western Police in Battle</p>
<p>Today at 3:00 PM</p>
<p>Today at 3:00 PM, Lehua will compete against Western Police in Group A at Shen Garden. Lehua has suffered two defeats due to the team's recent formation and lack of coordination. However, according to knowledgeable observers, the second result was better than the first. Today, there may be further improvements. Western Police's strength is indeed considerable, and Western Police is more likely to win. However, we still hope that Lehua will work hard and give us a satisfactory performance. Victory or defeat is not the only thing that matters. Referee: Graham</p>
<p>Yesterday's China Football Association</p>
<p>Encountered a Brawl</p>
<p>The China Football Association had a total of three matches yesterday. While the winners and losers of the results cannot escape the general rule of superiority and inferiority, it is true that brawls occurred among the players in all three games, either during the competition or at the end. This is indeed detrimental to the ethics of athletes and should be seriously corrected. The members of the association who are responsible for maintaining discipline should take steps to improve the situation.</p>
<p>(1) Yesterday's Results</p>
<p>Competing Teams Group Result Winner</p>
<p>Yuyou vs. Pagoda Middle School Forfeit Yuyou</p>
<p>Baogong vs. Youheng Ball 1 1-7 Youheng</p>
<p>Hualing vs. Zhixing Chinese 1-4 Zhixing</p>
<p>Brawl Situations</p>
<p>The battle between Yuyou and Pagoda was fierce and impressive. In the first half, Yuyou took the lead with a score of 1-0. In the second half, Yuyou's momentum increased, attacking more than defending, and took the lead with a score of 3-1. At that time, Pagoda's center forward advanced and kicked the head of a defender. The defender retaliated with a punch. Referee Shen Huichun ejected the defender and ordered the game to continue to avoid ending it, as there were only seven minutes left. Yuyou's defender was ordered to leave the field. Pagoda was still dissatisfied and stopped the game. The referee then announced that Pagoda had forfeited the game.</p>
<p>Baogong vs. Youheng Youheng's skills were well-developed and took a high advantage. After taking a 7-1 lead, one of their players was knocked down by a Baogong player. The Youheng player got up and retaliated with a punch. Baogong was about to get up and ask questions, but Youheng obeyed the referee's order and stopped. However, they were unwilling to accept the result and were going to negotiate with them outside the field after the game. After hearing this, they were also persuaded to stop.</p>
<p>Hualing vs. Zhixing The two teams were brave and unwilling to give in to each other. During the competition, they were able to get along peacefully under the command of the referee. However, as soon as the whistle blew, the players of the two teams started fighting. After the secretary of the association, Zhou Jiaqi, tried his best to persuade them, they dispersed. However, there will inevitably be some disputes in the committee meeting in the future.</p>
<p>Qingdao International Games</p>
<p>Clash Between China and Japan</p>
<p>Qingdao, 25th Dispatch: The International Games opened at 1:30 PM on the 25th. Only Chinese and Japanese athletes participated. In the four finals on the first day, China won 7 points and Japan won 29 points. On the afternoon of the 24th, Tiezhong and Richu held an international basketball championship match. Tiezhong won Richu 32-12. After the match, Japanese students in Jiangsu Road sought out Tiezhong students and a conflict occurred. Liu Zhende, a Tiezhong student, was injured on the head by a Japanese student with a baseball bat. Police officer Xing Jiying, who stepped forward to mediate, was also injured and surrounded the police station. The chief of the apartment sub-bureau and Japanese police arrived to persuade them to disperse. The injured police and students were sent to Puji Hospital to await resolution.</p>
<p>Jiangda Tennis Championships Yesterday's Preliminary Round</p>

These were unfinished, so the plan is for them to continue starting at 9:30 AM today. The round-robin period will necessarily need to be moved forward because the first group will start at 10:00 AM, and the second group (Jiaoda and West China Public University) will play at 1:00 PM. The results of yesterday's matches were as follows:</p>

<p>To Inspect China on the 29th of Next Month</p>
<p>The British Far East Commercial Survey Group, led by Sir Thompson, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4 PM on the 19th of September from London aboard the Maqidun [Macedon] steamer. As the group is scheduled to visit Japan first, they will take the original ship from Shanghai today, stay in Japan for a month, and plan to leave Shanghai on the 29th of next month to inspect Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other places for three months before returning to England.</p>
<p>Grain Committee Investigates Abundant Harvest Situation: Some Rice Ears Have Over Two Hundred Grains</p>
<p>This year's rice harvest is abundant, and various parties are spreading the word about the extent of the bountiful harvest. The local Grain Committee, based on surveys by rice industry members in Jiangsu Province, found that fields yielding less than two shi [approximately 100 kg] per mu [approximately 667 square meters] can now yield three shi. Fields previously used for miscellaneous grains in Jiangnan [south of the Yangtze River] have also been converted to rice cultivation this year. The situation in northern Jiangsu is similar. Currently, the best Japonica rice in Jiangsu Province sells for fifteen or sixteen yuan per shi in the local market, five or six yuan lower than during the lean period earlier this year. Dujian rice sells for just over ten yuan. Jiangxi indica rice sells for only two yuan and two jiao per dan [approximately 50 kg], and even after milling 224 jin [approximately 112 kg] into white rice, a dan is priced at only five yuan. Anhui rice production costs at most eight yuan, while Hunan rice costs only six yuan. Due to the provincial order to seal rice exports from Sian, Jiashan, and other places, there is nowhere to sell it. The early rice harvest in Tianjin is also good, potentially increasing by one million dan compared to previous years. According to estimates from various sources, Jiangsu Province may have a surplus of six to seven million shi of rice. Inspection of several rice ears produced in Songjiang revealed that each ear contains as many as two hundred and nine grains, with the fewest having one hundred and seventy grains. Normally, a rice ear has one hundred twenty to one hundred thirty grains, and one hundred fifty grains is already rare. This year, not only are the numbers higher, but some have over two hundred grains, which is truly auspicious. This report is based on communications from production area firms and cannot be considered entirely accurate. However, judging by the rice prices and rice ear observations, it is not far from the truth. Shortly after a famine, a year of abundance has arrived, which is fortunate for the livelihood of the common people. The photographs of each rice ear have been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for safekeeping and transfer.</p>
<p>August Municipal Household Statistics Report</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau reports monthly on changes in the city's population. The July statistics were reported in the previous issue.

<p>Japanese Vice-Minister Left Shanghai Yesterday Morning for the North</p>
<p>The Previous Night, Mayor Zhang Hosted a Farewell Banquet</p>
<p>Praising the Progress of the New China Before Departure</p>
<p>Japanese Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Nagai Ryutaro, accompanied by his secretary and five attendants, left Shanghai for Qingdao yesterday morning aboard the Dalian No. 9 steamer. After meeting with officials at the Japanese Consulate in the morning, he traveled by car to the pier to board the ship. Japanese Acting Minister Shigemitsu Aoi, Acting Consul General Miura Yoshiaki, and Japanese officials and dignitaries were at the pier to see him off. Chen, the Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and representatives from the municipal government and the Bankers Association also arrived at the wharf to see him off. The ship set sail at 9:00 AM, leaving Shanghai. Mayor Zhang Qun, in order to foster goodwill, hosted a farewell banquet the previous evening. Yesterday morning before departure, he entrusted Mr. Shigemitsu Aoi to convey his thanks on his behalf. Mr. Nagai expressed his personal thoughts at the Japanese Consulate yesterday morning, saying: "I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Shanghai and Nanjing this time. The construction in Nanjing and Shanghai is vastly different from when I last visited China thirteen years ago. The emerging atmosphere is very vigorous, with the completion of many roads and buildings. The spirit of a new country is visible everywhere. The government and party leaders I met were all energetic and spoke cheerfully, representing the intellectual class of the new China. I dare say that the current China is no different from Japan during the Meiji Restoration, progressing rapidly and with limitless prospects."</p>
<p>Head of the 19th Route Army Headquarters in Nanjing Replaced</p>
<p>Liu Peiquan, the director of the 19th Route Army Headquarters in Nanjing, has been ordered by General Commander Jiang Guangnai to conclude his handover. Zhuang Weigang has been appointed as the director of the office.</p>
<p>Chinese Medical Community Hosted Feerber Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Presented a "Description of Chinese Medicine Conditions"</p>
<p>Mr. Feerber, delegated by the League of Nations to investigate the conditions of Chinese medicine, has been receiving hospitality from various groups. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, he was accompanied by Xie Liheng, Jiang Wenfang, and Ding Jihua, representatives from the medical community, and Zhang Meian, a representative from the pharmaceutical community, to visit various institutions. First, they visited the Chinese Medical College, where they were received by Bao Shisheng, the college president, and inspected the fourth-year practical training classrooms and the affiliated hospital, which were well-organized. Next, they visited the Chinese Medicine Vocational School, where the Guangyi Chinese Medicine Hospital, affiliated with the school, was crowded with patients. Yu Hongsun hosted Mr. Feerber for a tour, and Mr. Feerber expressed great interest in the unique Chinese acupuncture treatment and took a photograph. They then visited the Jianyi Medical College, where a sign welcoming Mr. Feerber was displayed at the entrance. The college staff, led by Lu Yuanlei, hosted a tour of the classrooms, followed by a gathering with famous Shanghai doctors and students of the college in the playground for a group photo. Afterwards, refreshments were served, and the faculty members expressed their opinions and asked for Mr. Feerber's guidance. Mr. Feerber took the tour very seriously, recording all the questions he asked, and the schools provided him with published books for review. Next, they visited the Huang Jiuzhitang to see the retail sliced herbs department, hosted by Manager Yu Jiafu, and then visited the Hu Qingyutang's internal and external departments and Xu Chongdao's main branch, hosted by managers Chen Chuxiang and Ling Zhiliang. At 12:10 PM, they visited the Qianyi Traumatology Hospital, where many patients with dislocations and fractures were being treated. Director Zhang Deyi provided explanations one by one. It was already afternoon, and due to time constraints, they could not visit Renji Tang, the Cantonese Merchants' Hospital, the Siming Hospital, and other places as planned. They went to the New New Restaurant for lunch, accompanied by Zheng Siqin, a representative from the Municipal Education Bureau, and members of the medical and pharmaceutical communities. During the lunch, the chairman delivered a welcoming speech, stating that Mr. Feerber was entrusted by the League of Nations to investigate medicine, inquiring about Chinese medicine, allowing Eastern medicine to shake hands with world medicine, and expressing a warm welcome and hope. He noted that Chinese medicine is practical and effective, but its theories often do not align with the times. Scholars of world medicine, distrusting the outdated theories, also distrust the effective treatments, which is regrettable. Currently, people with scientific knowledge in the Chinese medical community are working hard to explain its treatments scientifically while eliminating some of its erroneous theories. Chinese medicine schools in the country are gradually moving in this direction. When this theory is published, it will surely progress together with world medicine. However, all Chinese medicine schools are privately run, and the government does not promote or subsidize them, so the equipment is very simple, and progress is not very fast. But we will do our best to move forward and make considerable contributions to academic research. He hoped that Mr. Feerber would convey this message to the League of Nations and ask for its spiritual assistance. Luo Xingyao translated the speech into English. Mr. Feerber replied that he was touched by the hospitality of the National Federation of Chinese Medicine, the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Association, the Chinese Pharmaceutical Industry Association, and various schools, and was very satisfied with his visit to various places. He felt that Chinese medicine did have special characteristics and was not entirely the same as that of European countries. Whether people are yellow or white, they seek treatment when they are sick. He admired the early invention of Chinese medicine compared to Europe, but European medicine has made rapid progress recently, and there are many aspects that can be adopted by Chinese medicine. He was honored by the request to share his opinions on improving Chinese medicine, but he could not fully contribute due to not fully understanding the content. However, he hoped that Chinese medicine would strive for improvement with a creative spirit, so that it would gradually approach world medicine. During the lunch, Lu Yuanlei, Zhang Meian, Xu Xiangren, and others exchanged opinions with Mr. Feerber. Qin Bomo of the Chinese Medicine Bookstore presented Mr. Feerber with five kinds of old and new medical books, and Huang Jiuzhitang presented a package of medicines. In order to help Mr. Feerber understand the Chinese medical cause, all groups nominated Jiang Wenfang to draft a "Description of Chinese Medicine Conditions" and translated it into English to present to Mr. Feerber. The Chinese Medical College and Jianyi Medical College also sent Mr. Feerber books on the content of ancient Chinese medicine and overviews of Chinese and Western medicine for reference. The "Description of Chinese Medicine Conditions" is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Description of Chinese Medicine Conditions</p>
<p>Mr. Feerber, entrusted by the League of Nations to come to China to investigate the conditions of Chinese medicine, visited Shanghai to see Chinese medicine schools, hospitals, etc., so that the content and conditions of Chinese medicine could be introduced by Mr. Feerber and spread to the world, which is a great honor. However, Chinese medicine has special circumstances, and it is difficult to understand it unless you have been familiar with it. In addition to designating specialists from several groups to accompany the visit for inquiries, a simple description is provided for Mr. Feerber's reference. Chinese medicine was invented more than 2,600 years before the Western calendar. At that time, it was only an accidental discovery and dissemination of facts, so it was quite simple. Later, scholars in the neck and shoulders worked hard to pursue the theory based on these facts and became a kind of academic. By the Han Dynasty (the beginning of the Western calendar), it was fully prepared, and all kinds of diseases had effective medicines for treatment. After that, medical scientists accepted the academic skills of their predecessors, participated in opinions and experiences, and constantly searched for more detailed treatment methods. Two hundred and fifty years ago, the royal power was used to summon its great achievements and formulate pharmacopoeias and medical books for application. Up to now, the medical books published and circulated by ancient and modern medical scientists have not been less than 2,300 copies, and other copies that have not been printed are not included. As for the diagnostic methods, people are often surprised and doubtful about the ability of traditional Chinese medicine to know the condition by taking the pulse. In fact, traditional Chinese medicine only divides the pulse image into six major outlines of floating, sinking, slow, virtual, and real, and then divides it into twenty-seven kinds, which are more detailed. Moreover, the diagnosis of traditional Chinese medicine does not only rely on taking the pulse, but can only determine the disease by combining the four elements of observation, smelling, asking, and touching. Therefore, those who study traditional Chinese medicine have a little foundation to look at the glory and wither of its complexion, hear the purity and astringency of its voice, ask about the course of its condition, and touch the state of its pulse to determine the location of the disease. The condition obtained by the three elements of observation, smelling, and asking coincides with the expression of the pulse image, so those with a little experience can usually understand the condition without paying much attention to observation, smelling, and asking, and can immediately understand the condition by carefully taking the pulse, without any other mysterious effect. Chinese medicine lacks the help of machinery, which is a shortcoming. The reason why it can satisfy patients is really due to the multi-efficiency of drugs. Because Chinese drugs have been sought for four thousand years and have as many as two thousand kinds, each disease has special drugs and prescriptions for coping, so it is still able to be competent and happy in treatment, and it can be assisted by methods such as acupuncture and guidance, so it can last for a long time and has a considerable amount of work for the reproduction of the nation. Although there is no accurate statistic on the number of current Chinese medicine practitioners, it is estimated that there are more than 1.2 million people based on reports from various places. The number of drug merchants is between 5 million and 7 million, and the value of drugs produced each year is about 200,000 yuan. The creation of Chinese medicine must go through three years of study and two to three years of practice to be able to respond to the world. Chinese medicine schools are generally privately established and privately run, and there are only fifteen in the country, so the learning of Chinese medicine is mostly passed down from the master, and the master does not allow his apprentice to open a business if he cannot prove that his apprentice is indeed capable of treating diseases, so reputation is important. As for Shanghai, there are more than 3,000 Chinese medicine practitioners with licenses from the Health Bureau, more than 420 pharmacies, 3 medical schools, and 14 charity halls specializing in hospitals and clinics. The most patients in each hospital clinic have more than 800 to 1,000 numbers, and each doctor sees a maximum of about 100 patients every day. The pharmacies earn a maximum of 700,000 to 800,000 yuan per year. This is a general overview of the status of Chinese medicine. Our Chinese medical community accepts the revival of a long history, maintains the arduous and great current situation, knows the importance of responsibility, and also knows that although there are long-lasting effective treatments and self-justifying academic theories, it is not enough to improve with the times to meet the desires of itself and society. In the past 20 years, more than 570 medical groups have been organized in various places to study methods of improvement. These more than 570 medical groups understood the benefits of uniting, so they established the National Federation of Chinese Medical Groups last year as a leading agency to concentrate thoughts and forces, and use the Chinese medicine schools as mechanisms for implementing improvements, striving to gradually approach the effective medicine of China with world medicine and seek happiness and health for all mankind. At the beginning of the development, I hope that Mr. Fei will add a kind promotion of the spirit of above aid.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang Scheduled to Host People from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang, upon being ordered to go to Liaoning, will be away from Shanghai for nearly four months and away from people from all walks of life for a long time. He specially invited Chinese and foreign women from all walks of life to a tea party at the Dahua Hotel from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM on Wednesday, the 29th of this month. It is expected to be a lively event at that time.</p>
<p>Representatives from Various Trade Unions Petitioned Yesterday for Trade Regulations</p>
<p>The World Association Expressed Acceptance</p>
<p>Each trade union in this world, because the General Assembly of All Members' Representatives presented a request to the official to approve the trade regulations for filing, should be regarded as the special regulations of the industry, and all non-member colleagues should abide by them equally. The case was rejected by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the wording was inappropriate, which will cause major disputes in commerce. Each industry is very worried. More than 50 groups, including the previous medicinal materials and cosmetics industries, gathered to discuss the measures. After discussion, it was decided to send representatives to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to petition to convene a city-wide conference of representatives to discuss jointly. Yesterday, representatives from the medicinal materials industry, Yao Chun, the cosmetics industry, Fu Keming, the North-South goods and dismantling industry, Chen Zixiang, the new medicine industry, Sun Choucheng, the shoe, leather, nail and cabinet industry, Gong Hongjun, the tooth and bone appliance industry, Wang Shouan, the pollen industry, Cheng Guichu, the fruit and local goods industry, Cai Runquan, the wood industry, Ge Liangqing, the industry, Bin Yao, the pawn shop industry, Ye Rongqing, and other representatives took the public letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to petition. They were received by Mr. Zheng Chengqing and Sun Mingqi from the association. The executive committee member Mr. Wang Yansong met with the representatives. The representatives spoke earnestly and were deeply dissatisfied with the reply from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, believing that it was completely out of touch with commercial sentiment. Mr. Wang expressed that he would represent the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to fully accept the wishes of the representatives. The representatives then resigned. It was also heard that 14 trade associations, including the North-South goods industry, also gathered to invite representatives from all trade associations in the city to hold a meeting at the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 1:00 PM on the 27th of this month to discuss the importance of the regulations of each industry.</p>
<p>Eighth District Party Department Opposes Ma Junwu's Harboring of Reactionaries</p>
<p>Reported by the Guominshe [Nationalist Society]</p>
<p>The Eighth District Party Department of this city has sent a telegram stating that Ma Junwu, the president of China Public School, is harboring reactionaries. The telegram reads: "Urgent to all Shanghai newspaper offices to forward to all levels of party departments, all agencies, all groups, and all schools for review. Wusong China Public School has always been controlled by reactionary elements, the student body is complex, and factions are divided. Our party members are often unreasonably suppressed. Since Ma Junwu took office as president, Communist Party members and Nationalists have been unusually active, and leaflets and slogans are commonplace. Our association has paid close attention to this, so special commissioners are sent to conduct secret investigations at any time for handling. On the evening of the 14th of this month, the student union of the Department of Political Economy of the school held a preparatory meeting. Comrade Li Xiong, a member of our party, was elected chairman, and Comrade Wu Haifan was elected recorder. Reactionary elements dared to use their disruptive abilities, shouting and gathering their comrades to surround the meeting place, kicking over benches, and shouting loudly, causing a very serious situation. The chairman remained calm, and the members present remained calm as usual. When the agenda was completed, reactionary elements dared to throw stones at the chairman's podium like rain. After the meeting, the chairman was seized and beaten by reactionary elements at the door, shouting reactionary slogans, causing great chaos and even a riot. The investigators sent by our association, seeing that the situation was critical, immediately rushed to report to the meeting. Our association sent personnel to notify the nearby military camp to send a team to suppress the riot and capture two reactionary elements, Deng Zhongbang and Wei Ti𦒋. Zhang Guohui temporarily escaped, and Lin Hongliang was not found after a thorough search. Many Communist Party declarations were found in the reactionary elements' dormitory, and Deng Zhongbang, Zhang Guohui, and others had previous reactionary cases. The two captured were taken to the camp for safekeeping. This is the situation on the evening of the 14th. The next morning, our association sent a letter to Ma Junwu, the president of the school, asking him to investigate. Unexpectedly, Ma Junwu not only did not take precautions beforehand, but afterwards dared to openly harbor reactionary elements and suppress our party members. On the one hand, he presented a guarantee to release the captured reactionary elements Deng Zhongbang and Wei You𦒋, and notified the escaped reactionary elements Zhang Guohui and Lin Hongliang to return to school and be properly protected. On the other hand, he falsely accused our party members Li Xiong and Yan Jingzhao of privately reporting to the military and disturbing the school order, and expelled them from school. Upon hearing the news, our association immediately contacted Ma Junwu and was rejected. Such behavior is truly disrespectful to our party. Since Ma Junwu took office as president of China Public School, countless facts have violated the party. Here are a few: (1) No Party Ideology Course - There is no Party Ideology course in the school's curriculum. Our association ordered its first branch to repeatedly request the addition, but it was ignored. This is one. (2) Defaming the Party Leader - Although the school has a nominal commemoration week for the Party Leader, it is not held weekly in fact. Even when it is held, it does not follow the prescribed rituals, such as singing the Party song, saluting the Party and national flags and the Party Leader's portrait, and respectfully reading the Party Leader's will. This is all omitted, which is disrespectful to the Party Leader. This is two. (3) Not Displaying the Party Flag - The school's auditorium hangs various national flags, but the Party flag and the national flag are nowhere to be found in the school. They are not hung during any grand ceremonies. This is not only disrespectful to the Party but also disrespectful to China. This is three. (4) Harboring Reactionary Elements - The school is the base of the Communist Party in the Wusong area, and the Nationalists are also very arrogant. Ma Junwu is deliberately colluding with them, taking them as his confidants, ordering Deng Zhongbang and others to be responsible for the bail and properly protecting them, and appointing Luo Longji, whose remarks are reactionary and have been verified, as his right-hand man, donating 10,000 yuan to the construction fund of the Changfeng Society (the organ of the Nationalist faction) and serving as a senior consultant. The society is grateful for his kindness and hangs a huge portrait of him for people to admire, and also plans to carve a portrait of him to commemorate their gratitude. All these are ironclad evidence that Ma Junwu is harboring reactionary elements and colluding with the Nationalist faction. This is four. (5) Opposing Party Rule - Ma Junwu also teaches a course on the history of modern culture at the school. When teaching the chapter on modern political systems, he openly declared that China should adopt a representative system, denouncing the Party's advocacy of Party rule without reservation. This is five. In summary, in addition to submitting to the higher-level party department to forward to the central government for verification, all the facts of Ma Junwu's harboring of reactionaries and suppressing party members concern the party and the country's future and are by no means insignificant. At this moment, the remnants of the military bandit are initially wiped out, and reactionary elements are plotting conspiracies, which is dangerous everywhere. Please express your indignation together and condemn them unanimously. The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality Eighth District Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang kowtows with seal."</p>
<p>Expediting the Reporting of Autumn Land Survey Results</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government sent a telegram to the Finance Bureau yesterday, stating: "According to the Finance Department’s telegram, 'The new regulations for this year's autumn land survey stipulate that the deadline for reporting disasters in the former Su, Chang, Hu, and Hai counties is the end of September. Those who fail to report within the deadline will not be allowed. The province has noted that most of the counties in Jiangnan [south of the Yangtze River] have had bumper harvests this year, and the county has not reported any disasters. Therefore, the entire crop should be assessed as fully mature. Although the date for the final decision is the beginning of November, it will arrive in a blink of an eye and cannot be delayed. The county should supervise the Finance Bureau to prepare and submit a register as soon as possible for verification. In addition to sending a separate telegram, a special telegram is sent to the county magistrate to comply with and implement it without delay, and not to be held accountable.' Having received this, it is appropriate to forward the telegram to the Director of the Bureau, instructing him to immediately comply with it, prepare and submit a register as soon as possible for verification and transfer, without delay."</p>

<p>Miao Zhongxiu Discusses Silk Sales Trends</p>
<p>Oversupply in Japan and Stagnant Sales in Europe and America</p>
<p>Raw silk is a major export commodity of our country, closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Recently, due to the sharp decline in silk sales and the fall in market prices, most silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have suspended operations, and tens of thousands of workers have lost their jobs. This has had a great impact on social economy and security. A reporter from the Da Wuchen Society [Great Morning Star Society] specially visited Mr. Miao Zhongxiu, the Director of the Raw Silk Inspection Office of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, to inquire about his opinion on the sales of raw silk. According to Mr. Miao, the decline in the world's silk industry is due to two factors: (1) Reduced silk sales in Europe and America; (2) Excessive production in Japan. As for the former, the economic conditions of various countries are unstable, and people's purchasing power is weak. Silk fabrics are not necessities, and most people are saving money. In addition, the production of rayon has increased significantly, and its value is low, making it difficult for raw silk to compete. Our country is affected by the reduction in silk sales in foreign countries and the overproduction of Japanese silk, so silk prices have plummeted along with Japanese silk. Internally, our production is poor, the quality is poor, the labor costs have increased, and the cost cannot be reduced, making it difficult to compete with Japanese silk. If there is no help from cheap silver, silk prices will be even more unbearable. The United States is the world's largest silk-consuming country, and changes in US sales have a great impact on our country's silk sales. US silk factories usually complete the planning of new styles in the fall and purchase huge amounts of raw silk at the end of the year to prepare for sales in the spring. A detailed examination of the amount of silk in stock in the United States at the end of each year can reveal this. Last November, the amount of silk in stock increased to 90,772 dan, the highest in previous years. This September, there were only 47,621 dan in stock. October is likely to decrease rather than increase, but silk fabric sales have picked up slightly after the fall. Statistically speaking, silk sales should be more active at the end of the year, but Japan's silk stocks are about 150,000 dan, and our country is also close to 10,000 dan. Whether silk sales can be unaffected by silk stocks depends on the level of activity. It is difficult to predict at this time.</p>
<p>Special District Court Scheduled to Burn Opium Paraphernalia</p>
<p>The Special District Court sent a letter to various agencies yesterday stating that the opium and opium paraphernalia confiscated by the court, which were confiscated between April 1 and June 30 of this year, were burned once in the open space of the Baoantang Yizhong [Charitable Cemetery] on North Zhejiang Road, next to the court, on July 20. Now that the three-month period of July, August, and September has expired, the burning of opium paraphernalia will still be held publicly at the Baoantang Yizhong [Charitable Cemetery] on North Zhejiang Road, next to the court, at 2:00 PM on October 31. In addition to reporting and sending letters to the agencies and posting a notice, a corresponding letter is sent to request that personnel be dispatched to the site at that time to show prudence.</p>
<p>Two Captured Missionaries in Jiangxi Released and Returned to Shanghai</p>
<p>Will Go to Nanjing to Seek Aid from the National Government</p>
<p>The Great America Evening News reported that more than a dozen Catholic priests and nuns in Ji'an, Jiangxi Province, were captured by the Communist Party. Bishop Mignani and Father Jing Lisi were released to return to negotiate the ransom. Mignani and Jing arrived in Shanghai yesterday with Father Bai Jinke, stationed in Jishui, aboard the Poyang steamer from Jiujiang. They plan to go to Nanjing to seek aid from the National Government and French, Italian, and American officials. According to Father Bai, the comrades were captured in Ji'an on October 5. After the provincial army abandoned the city and fled, peasant soldiers entered five churches and detained the people for parades in the streets. A Chinese technician was disemboweled and killed by the bandits, and another person was escorted out of the city and is thought to have been killed. The comrades mistakenly believed the officials' words and did not try to escape first. It was not until the Red Army officers entered the city that they forbade the abuse of the captured people, housed them in two rooms, and provided them with soldiers' rations, allowing them to go out for walks or shop in stores. The captured nuns were left outside the city to take care of the wounded soldiers. The Red Army leader initially only wanted to release Father Jing Lisi and order him to raise a ransom. After Bishop Mi pleaded bitterly, saying that his church had little financial resources and could not borrow much money, he asked to be allowed to go with Father Jing to raise money more easily. The bandit leader then agreed and issued two passes. The ransom demanded by the bandits was initially set at one million yuan, then reduced to 620,000 yuan. Now it is undetermined, only saying ransom. Father Bai himself expected Jishui to fall and fled the city. At that time, the river was controlled by bandits, so he traveled in disguise for five days, arriving in Fengcheng and taking a boat to Nanchang, where he escaped.</p>

<p>Municipal Party Department Preparing to Establish Cooperative Instructor Training Center</p>
<p>Outline Plan Approved</p>
<p>The cooperative enterprise is a more effective way to remedy the economic slump in modern times, and the training of talents to guide cooperative enterprises is an urgent task at present. The party departments at all levels in this city have successively requested the establishment of the Municipal Party Department Training Department. In view of this, the Municipal Party Department has carefully reviewed the actual situation and formulated an outline plan for the establishment of the Cooperative Enterprise Instructor Training Center and submitted it to the Municipal Executive Committee for a resolution. It is now learned that the department has sent a letter to the Cooperative Society requesting it to assign personnel to be responsible for the teaching. Once the instructors are determined, the opening will be scheduled. All students will be selected by the party departments in each district according to the prescribed quota in order to promote guidance and conduct in each district in the future.</p>
<p>Membership in Trade Associations Should be Based on Business</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sent a Letter to the Chaozhou Sugar and Grocery Association Yesterday</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce wrote a letter to the Chaozhou Sugar and Grocery Association yesterday saying: "In response to your previous letter stating that the Shengyi Gongsuo [Association] of the Chaozhou fruits and groceries industry is different in terms of help and cannot join the Fruits and Local Goods Trade Association, please give guidance. It has been ascertained that the business nature of the Chaozhou fruit industry is exactly the same as that of the reorganized Fruit Opening Trade Association. Even if there are a few companies that also sell canned fruits, they cannot distinguish themselves from the general fruit industry. Moreover, when the association was registered with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the column of business scope only contained the words 'Chaozhou sugar and various groceries' and did not include the fruit industry. The letter now states that the Shengyi Gongsuo of the fruit industry has belonged to it for many years, and the fruit industry differs from the Shixingtang [Time-Line Hall] fruit industry in terms of north and south. It is inevitable that the business scope listed in the previous registration form is inconsistent, and the location of the fruit industry is very close to the Fruit Local Goods Trade Association. At the 17th Standing Committee meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, it was discussed that the principle of the Law of Industry and Commerce Trade Associations is that only one association is allowed to be established in one region, and the business scope should be the limit. There is absolutely no help. Moreover, the location of the industry is very close to the Fruit Local Goods Trade Association, and the business nature is completely different. It should join the Fruit Local Goods Trade Association in accordance with the law."</p>
<p>Measures for Replenishment of Trade Union Staff</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asked for Interpretation</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce presented to the Bureau, stating: "This month, on the 21st, the Copper and Tin Trade Association of this city sent a letter stating that its member Fuyuhao [Wealth Abundance Firm] has ceased its operations, and its manager, Jin Yao , is one of the executive committee members of the association. He submitted a letter of resignation and announced his withdrawal from the association. The previous election held by the association had no replacement in addition to the stipulated eleven people, and the Trade Union Law also has no provisions for replacements. Now that Committee Member Jin has announced his resignation, whether the number is insufficient or Committee Member Jin is still requested to stay in office should be urgently requested from your association for verification and instructions for compliance. The provisions of Article 4 of the Law of Industry and Commerce Trade Associations regarding the number of committee members do not have replacement names. Although Article 10 of the same law states that 'the provisions of the Association Law regarding the staff and meetings shall be applicable to the Industry and Commerce Trade Associations', the most recent document from your bureau has passed on the text that the Law of Trade Associations has special provisions that are not applicable to the Law of Chambers of Commerce. The Trade Association cannot apply the Law of Chambers of Commerce to add alternate executive committee members, which is restricted by the order of the Ministry. How should this be handled? A written request is submitted to your bureau for your approval and interpretation for the convenience of the public."</p>

<p>Preparations for Re-election of the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association</p>
<p>The term of office of the chairman, vice-chairman, and all members of the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association, which has been re-elected since November of last year, is about to expire. The staff of the association is preparing to handle the election procedures in mid-November. However, because the original clubhouse is being renovated, it is temporarily borrowing the remaining rooms of the Shandong Guild Hall as an office. According to the staff of the association, the meeting was originally scheduled to be held today, but most of the committee members said it was inconvenient due to the distance. It is heard that another suitable location will be found for the meeting at the time of the election.</p>

<p>Financial and Gold Market Show Excellent Signs The market price went from low to high. Yesterday, the 25th, the gold market saw a morning dip and an afternoon surge. Initially, it hovered around one tael, but then it rose steadily, reaching a high point. However, the overall difference was still more than ten taels. In contrast, the foreign exchange market was significantly different. The listed price had increased by half a point. Dealers generally closed their positions, mostly hedging. Trading within the market was quite brisk, with short covering being more prevalent than selling. Hengxing, Shengda, Daxin, Heng and others actively bought, while Yuancheng, Yongda, Decheng and others sold first and then bought. Yuanmao, Yongwan, Xingrun, Changyu and others all sold positions. Overseas silver markets had already risen, so the opening price was low, hovering around 79 taels. Later, due to strong buying, the exchange rate slightly tightened. It seemed that banks were absorbing funds. By noon, the progress was even more noticeable. Hengxing, Xinheng and others aggressively pursued purchases, creating a rising trend. The price soared by ten taels, suddenly jumping to 589 taels, a new high since the market opened in December. However, the bulls took this opportunity to sell, especially since the exchange rate showed no sign of further decline. People's confidence turned firm, and the rapid shift to stability eased, eventually declining by more than three taels. In the afternoon, due to the customary Saturday closure, the market was suspended. Observing the situation, it was difficult for the bears to be optimistic. In reality, the atmosphere was one of latent strength. Banks were still absorbing spot goods, and the total amount felt particularly scarce. The high point was 89 taels. The December opening price in the morning was 579 taels and a half, immediately dropping by two taels and three qian (the gross price being around 80 taels). London silver bars had rebounded by one-eighth. New York silver prices also rose by one-quarter. The exchange rate decreased by one-sixteenth. Subsequently, Run Changyu, Yu Dacheng, Yong and others sold, causing a further decline of one tael, settling at 78 taels and a half, with fluctuations of seven to eight qian. As for the exchange rate, it also eased. The Korean government offered one tael of gold at two qian and eight fen this month. The French bank strongly offered English gold at 1/73125 shilling this month. When it was announced, the price was around 79 taels, with the listed price increasing by 125. US gold rose by 25. Japanese gold decreased by one fen. However, the gold price was still stable, only slightly decreasing by three to four qian, estimated at 78 taels and eight to nine qian. As for internal English gold, it was still weak. Shanghai sold December gold at 1/7375. Also, Citibank offered 39 yuan and 1875 fen through the French bank in January, which was absorbed by the gold market. However, later the market buyers gradually became active. Daxing, Yuanheng, Yu Da and others began to pursue purchases. By 10 o'clock, it had returned to the 80 tael mark. All firms continued to buy. English gold was offered by Maixing and others at 1/73125 in December. After 10:30, the gold market suddenly absorbed 1/73125 in January, and Yuancheng, Xinheng, Yuanxing, Yong and others competed to buy, causing the price to jump three to four taels, reaching beyond 85 taels around 11 o'clock. However, there was a fluctuation of one to two taels. Later, Wupin, Yuanmao, Yong, Hengxing, Shengda and others vigorously bought, adding another three taels. The market situation was extremely sharp and unusually volatile. Zhejiang Datong mutually made a deal for April US dollars at 39 yuan and 0625 fen. Shanghai Mitsui sat opposite to a deal for November English gold at 1/71875. At 11:20, the price suddenly dropped by more than one tael. Retail investors came to sell, and the peak reappeared immediately. Hengxing's buying momentum was strong, and it urgently covered previous short positions. Thus, by 11:30, it reached 89 taels and two qian. However, the foreign exchange market was not necessarily bullish. Yuanmao, Yong Zhifeng, Yong and other firms had entered the market to sell, and bank notes also came up for sale, preventing a firm footing and resulting in a decline of more than three taels. By the noon closing, it was estimated at 85 taels and seven qian, an increase of three taels and nine qian compared to the previous day. However, there was a subsequent fluctuation of about one tael, estimated at around 86 taels. This was mainly because the bulls had sold some positions, while the bears covered. Since today is a Saturday and the market is closed, the transactions were generally balanced. The fluctuation was ten taels and seven qian. An investigation revealed that the maximum price during the half-day was 89 taels and two qian, and the minimum price was 78 taels and a half, a difference of ten taels and seven qian, which is considered significant. Wupin opened at nine taels and a half in the morning and closed at 86 taels at noon. The listed price had been changed to 623 taels and four qian. Calculating the daily gold price with a small discount of one fen, it was priced at 44 taels, then 35 to 36 taels, and closed at around 38 taels at noon.</p>
<p>Speculative Buyers Predominate Each firm's transactions varied, but there were more buyers. It was estimated that Hengxing, Shengda, Yuancheng, Xinheng, Fuyu, Taixing, Yuanheng, Dadecheng and others all bought, while Wanxing, Shunli, Yuanmao, Yong, Runchang, Yu and others sold. There were more buyers than sellers. Zhifeng, Yong, Yuancheng, Yongfu, Changchun, Yuanyong, Xieyu, Yuantai and others had occasional buying and selling. Foreign exchange hedging transactions showed a distinct difference. Dalian Bang sold 2,000 contracts while buying hundreds. Guangdong Bang bought more than 2,000 contracts to offset previous short positions. Foreign exchange listed prices increased by half a point.</p>
<p>Internal Market Trends Diverge from Gold Market Yesterday, the overseas silver market continued to rise, while the exchange rate fell. HSBC's listed prices for various exchanges also increased by half a point. English gold rose by 125, now at one shilling and seven pence. US gold rose by 25 cents, estimated at 38 and a half. Indian gold increased by 15, estimated at 106 rupees and 75. The combined French and Western gold increased by 75, estimated at 95 cents and a half. French India increased by six yuan, estimated at 980 yuan. German exchange increased by one yuan, estimated at 161 marks and five. Singapore exchange decreased by one tael, estimated at 146 taels and 75. Hong Kong exchange remained at 82 taels and 25. Japanese gold decreased by one fen, estimated at one tael, two qian and nine fen and 25. As for internal market trends, it was stable, initially low and then firm. The gold market turned bullish, surging beyond 85 taels, especially bullish at noon, reaching 89 taels. As a result, the foreign exchange market also strengthened, but settlements were slightly subdued, still up about four taels compared to the previous day. However, foreign exchange was not the same, almost a different trend. At noon closing, English and Japanese gold showed no significant changes compared to the previous evening, while US gold rose by 125. If it weren't for the gold market pulling it up, it would have been weak. Chinese merchants had some hedging. English gold transactions totaled more than 100,000 pounds. Banks such as Yuli, Shanghai Maixing, Sumitomo, and Sanjing all sold, while Guangdong Bang, Hengxing, Shengda and others sold tens of thousands of pounds to hedge gold. The gold market's appetite for buying was still strong, and the gold firms that bought sold notes to offset the high amount. Various firms mutually traded 100,000 pounds, and the Shanghai Bank sold positions. US dollars were mutually traded for more than 100,000 yuan, and Chinese merchants settled for 100,000 yuan. As for Japanese gold, Dalian Bang bought more than 1 million yuan, while Huabi and Korea sold some. In the afternoon, the market was closed as usual due to Saturday.</p>
<p>English Exchange The internal market saw an increase or decrease of 125. In the morning, the price for November was 1 shilling and 7 pence and 25. December and January were 7 pence and 3125. The buying price increased by 0625. At noon closing, the price for November was 1875, and December and January were 25. The buying price was 3125.</p>
<p>US Exchange The internal market fluctuated by 25. In the early morning, the price for November was 39 yuan, and January was 39 yuan and 125. The buying price increased by 5. At noon closing, the price for November was 36 yuan and 875. The buying price was 39 yuan and 1.</p>
<p>Eastern Exchange The internal market had a difference of half a fen during the half-day. From the early market, the price for this month was one tael, two qian and eight fen and 25. November was eight fen, December was seven fen and 75, and January was seven fen and five. The buying price was reduced by half a fen. At noon closing, the price for this month was one tael, two qian and eight fen and a half, and the buying price was eight fen. The price for November was eight fen and 25, December was eight fen, and January was seven fen and 75. The buying price was seven fen and 25. There was no market in the afternoon. Overseas Silver Market Rebounds Due to Chinese Buying</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to London telegraph, the price of large silver bars rebounded due to Chinese buying. The market was stable with a firm tone. After the closing, it was stable. Near and far term prices both rebounded by 125, both at 16 and a half pence (equivalent to English gold at one shilling and seven and a half pence). The New York telegraph also reported that US silver prices also rebounded by 25, estimated at 35 cents and 75 for spot goods. Mumbai spot goods rebounded by two annas, estimated at 47 rupees and 04 annas. English to US increased by 0625, and US to English increased by 03125, both at 4 dollars, 8 jiao, 5 fen, 96875. Japanese to US rebounded slightly by 0625, estimated at 49 yuan and 75. English to English increased by 03125, estimated at 2 shillings and 059375. English Shanghai shilling remained at one shilling and seven and a half pence. Also, at 9:15 in the morning, the Reuters news agency reported no changes. The price was omitted. The Handling of Silver and Cash by Silver Houses Showed Vast Differences Yesterday, because the banks were closed on Saturday afternoon as usual, the handling was plain. However, the silver houses, being the 25th, a large settlement period, and also facing a large number of long-term maturities, had to be settled, leading to extraordinarily busy procedures. However, the market's tael-cent transactions remained as before. The market price in the morning was 7 qian, 2 fen, 6 li, 2 hao and a half, and in the noon market, it was 7 qian, 2 fen, 6 li, 6 hao and 2 hu a half, with settlements appearing to be more than half a li. The silver dismantling rate in the morning and noon markets was the same, at 3 fen, which was a decrease of 2 fen compared to the previous day. The head of the Hua brand made overseas remittance transactions, estimated at 1.22 million in the morning market and 733,000 for the noon market. There were no banknote transactions. In the off-market banknote market, it was 140,000 in the morning market and 55,000 in the noon market. Bank transactions were even scarcer, with 350,000 in the morning interbank market and 400,000 in the noon market. The receiving and delivering of taels between various banks was over 1.4 million, with over 1 million in banknote inflow and outflow. For silver transactions, Chinese merchants' remittance transactions were over 3.1 million, and foreign merchants' remittance transactions were over 2.2 million. Various cargo exchange taxes and miscellaneous transactions totaled over 9 million. 400,000 was deposited into the warehouse, and 500,000 was withdrawn from the warehouse. Japanese banks' transactions totaled 4.3 million, with 600,000 withdrawn from the warehouse. The silver houses' public notes and silver public notes settlements saw a lot of settlements due to the settlement period, and the time was also delayed, making the quantity impossible to calculate. As for the head remittance settlement, it was difficult to predict, whether it was silver or yuan. Small firms' transactions totaled over 500,000. Southern small yuan was 6 qian, 4 fen, 3 li and a half in the morning market, and 6 qian, 4 fen, 4 li and 2 hao and a half in the noon market. 2,000 jiao were transacted in the morning market, and 2,500 jiao were transacted in the noon market. Guangdong small yuan was 6 qian, 3 fen and 6 li in the morning market, and also 6 qian, 3 fen and 6 li in the noon market. 75,000 jiao were transacted in the morning market, and 35,000 jiao were transacted in the noon market. Copper coins remained at 300, which means 1,000 long-term settlements matured.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the 25th, was the maturity date for long-term settlements. According to investigations, the total settlement amount reached 14.5 million, with transfers or payments being cleared or new transactions being made. The clearing up of the threads was complicated, and the busyness of the procedures can be imagined. However, given the poor market conditions, many businesses were affected, and the financial community dared not rashly continue to lend. The situation was particularly busy. According to people in the industry, the amount of deposits transferred to other accounts yesterday was also several million. About one-third of the long-term loans were transferred, with 3 to 4 million being recovered, and several million were newly made. As for the interest rate, it was generally determined by the needs of commercial users, ranging from 8 and a half taels to 10 taels and 05 qian. It was also heard that Ningbo banks lent 2 to 3 million to Shanghai, and there were many transfers of old debts. It was also heard that the amount of long-term maturities in Hankou this time was 6 to 7 million, which were generally rolled over, but the interest rate had not yet been determined. It was said that the interest rate of the Hankou banks must be higher than other banks, with the lowest price needing to be above 12 taels. As for the interest rates in the inland areas, the differences were too great to be accurately determined. Securities 19 Customs Duty Decreases One Yuan</p>
<p>Enlistment and Troop Reduction Also Weak, Only Seven-Year Bonds Rose Yesterday, the spot market for public bonds was unusually quiet, with no transactions for any bonds in the front or rear markets. The futures market was still good, but the conditions for each bond were very different. The whole Sixth Customs Duty, Post-Disaster, Cigarette Tax and 1996 Bonds were very stable. In the front and rear markets, they mostly hovered around one to two jiao, with slight fluctuations compared to the previous day. Enlistment, Troop Reduction and 19th Year Customs Duty were peaceful in the front market, but in the afternoon, supply exceeded demand, and they rebounded and fell again. The 19th Year Customs Duty fell more sharply, decreasing by one yuan compared to the previous day. Enlistment and Troop Reduction futures were around 0.6 jiao. The seven-year bonds were very scarce, and almost all spot goods in the market were collected. Due to continued demand, the price actually rose by two yuan compared to the previous day. It was estimated that 4.5 million was transacted in the morning and about 4 million in the afternoon, totaling about 8.5 million yuan. Among them, Troop Reduction and 19th Year Customs Duty each accounted for 270 to 80,000, Enlistment for over 130,000, and the others remained quiet.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Continues to Weaken The yarn market was weak. The overseas market situation was stable, but the demand for spot yarn was sluggish, and the commission agents' appetite was very slow. As a result, people's confidence was not boosted. Also, this month, due to sufficient deliveries, buyers were lacking, and the market continued to fall. Only Sichuan banks had a slight appetite, actually taking over 1,000 bales yesterday.</p>
<p>Near-Term Yarn Uniquely Falls One to Two Taels The pre-auction market atmosphere was still weak. The market lacked buyers. Month 1 tael and 2 qian Month 7 qian</p>
<p>Some profit-takers covered short positions, so it rose by 2 to 3 qian. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 21,950 bales.

<p>Spot yarn market trend is difficult to boost, and market conditions are flat. Among the out-of-town banks, only Sichuan took in 1,065 bales, the largest. In addition, Guangdong took in 35 bales, inland took in 230 bales, Yunnan took in 144 bales, Jiangxi took in 50 bales, Xuzhou took in 55 bales, Qingdao took in 30 bales, and miscellaneous banks took in 50 bales. Cotton Market: Weak Situation</p>
<p>The cotton market was slightly weak, but the trend of US cotton was still good, so the bulls continued to buy and increase their positions. However, the sales of spot cotton in the market remained sluggish, and the intentions of the factory agents remained stagnant. Therefore, some took the opportunity to sell short when the price rose. The Chaozhou banks' attitude was calm, with no short covering. Most of their previous mentality was to buy standard low-grade Huoji cotton for five qian. The subsequent steps will still depend on US cotton and the actual situation for a turn.</p>
<p>Hankou Auction Brokerage Record The Hankou auction market opened in the morning with solid sentiment. With US cotton still rising, each month rose by one qian.

The total transaction volume for the whole day was 56,900 dan. It was found that Gongtai bought 3,400 dan, Shenchang bought 2,300 dan, and Yongji bought 2,900 dan.

<p>The Main Reasons for the Transfiguration Activities of US Cotton Last Week New York, 24th, reported on the raw cotton of the week. At the beginning of the week, the market conditions were unusually calm. Later, the transfiguration activities were due to the gradual improvement of the securities market and the smooth buying of domestic and foreign firms. The sales of Southern spot goods decreased compared to the same period last year, but the demand was obviously sufficient to absorb the supply in the market and maintain its consolidation. The cotton market was also showing signs of improvement, and there were reports of Southern factories increasing work. The results of the first severe frost did not result in significant losses. It was heard that some people had not only continued to collect part of their new cotton, but also purchased long-term futures in preparation for tax cuts next spring. The weekend statistics are attached below (unit: 1,000 bales). 1929 1930 Cumulative Listing This Season 6288 5760 Cumulative Factory Usage Since August 1 1876 1111 Cumulative Exports 1856 2001 To Japan 231 242 To China 44 89 To England 325 313 To Germany 585 651 New York Inventory 97 230 Port Town Inventory 3331 4806 Worldwide Supply 6321 8289 Among them, US Cotton 4619 6573 Worldwide US Cotton Withdrawal Since August 1 12432 2280</p>
<p>US Cotton Cooperative Sales Method The Texas Cotton Industry Cooperative, the most prosperous cotton-producing state in the United States, recently established two cooperative sales methods: one is cotton season sales, and the other is price settlement sales. When handing over cotton, farmers in the cooperative can use either one or both methods, but they must specify it when handing over the cotton, and cannot change it afterward. The so-called cotton season sales method means that those who hand over cotton according to this method can receive the currently approved loan when shipping the cotton. In other words, any bank in the state is allowed to use new cotton that has not yet been classified as collateral for a loan to cooperative farmers. After the cotton's grade and fiber are inspected, the loan is supplemented. This type of cotton is issued loan funds in addition to the loan funds depending on the amount of the future sales revenue based on its grade. Once the cotton has been handed over in accordance with the cotton season sales method, the farmer has no control over when it should be sold and when it should not be sold. This type of cotton can be sold by the cooperative at any time during the cotton season. After the cotton season is over, the cotton that has not been sold or has been transferred to the cotton industry maintenance company under the cotton season sales method can be based on the average price of each type of cotton sold during the cotton season to collect the final payment. However, the average expenses, insurance costs, freight costs, warehouse fees, interest, and 1% of the public bond funds managed by the cooperative must be deducted. The use of the above cotton season sales method has the effect of keeping cotton out of the market, which can help stabilize market prices and implement an orderly sales process. As for cotton using price settlement sales, only the currently approved loan can be received at the time of delivery or when the goods arrive if the price has not been settled. However, the cotton owner has the right to settle the price at any time during the cotton season. The cooperative sells its spot cotton and determines its base price. Before the price is settled, the cotton owner cannot receive the money except for the currently approved loan. After the price is settled, the cooperative will pay the full value, but a small amount must be withheld to pay for the cooperative's expenses to be settled at the end of the cotton season. If the market price of this type of cotton falls to the point where it is equal to the loan funds, freight costs, and expenses in accordance with the New York futures price, the cooperative has the right to sell the cotton without notifying the cotton owner. Grain Sunny Weather Causes Rice Market to Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were only twenty to thirty boats arriving at Zhabei from various banks, but the inventory downstream was still thick. Market sales were very quiet. The sky was clear after the solar term, so people's confidence had changed. The high-quality new japonica rice fell by two to three jiao. Special top-quality rice opened at 14 yuan and 6 to 7 jiao, while ordinary and lower grades of japonica rice fell by 4 to 5 jiao due to lack of demand. At the moment, the japonica rice market is still difficult to gain a foothold. It will only have a chance to turn around after the sales market becomes active. Yang xiang rice and Duzi xiang rice had a few transactions in the morning, but then also became sluggish. The arrival was indeed scarce, and the price fell by two to three jiao, with signs of further decline. Port xiang rice and Ke xiang rice markets were relatively stable. The source of Wan Ning was declining, and accumulated inventory had decreased. The scattered sales to ordinary people were diligent due to the low price, so the large market rarely saw insult. The price of new and old Baiyuan rice were all stable. Therefore, the goods here were extremely depleted, so the owners were selling at a higher price, and the market was difficult to ease.</p>
<p>Yesterday, over twenty boats arrived at South Shanghai. Sales on this street were very sluggish. The high price of new japonica rice from Changbang was slightly soft by about one jiao, while medium and lower grades dropped slightly by about half a jiao. The top japonica rice barely opened at 14 yuan and 3 jiao. The overall trend was more gentle compared to the North City. The arrival and sales of Su Tongji japonica rice were both sluggish, and the inventory was also small. Shops' appetite for buying was limited, and the market situation was quite depressed. The market prices barely held steady at the original price. The arrival of thin rice and white rice from Nanbang was very small. It was not cost-effective for both the producing and selling cities, so although the sales were sluggish, the price was still stable. The buying momentum for Yang and Du each was also quiet, and the price was shouted lower by half a jiao. Ordinary rice opened at 10 yuan with some change. The arrival and hoisting of Bianyuan were slightly flat, and the situation was stable. The sales of Yinhua still sluggish after the self-cutting, so high-quality rice still opened at 14 yuan. The flour market was still downstream.</p>
<p>After opening in the morning, the flour market was hit by the fall in ocean wheat. Although people's confidence was unusually weak, the lowest price for this month was 2 taels, 2 qian, 6 fen and a half, and for November, it was 2 taels, 2 qian, 4 fen and 7 li and a half, which was invisibly lower by two to three fen compared to the previous day's closing price. The distant months also fell by one fen at the same time. However, due to the urgent need for October and November shipments from buyers, there was a rebound of over one fen. However, due to the general sentiment that ocean wheat would flood the market in the future among people inside and outside the industry, the market atmosphere was weak and lifeless. Observing the subsequent steps, it was feared that the situation in the distant months would return to the 2 qian mark. As a result, this month was down a small one and a half fen compared to the previous day, November was down a small one fen and seven li and a half, December was down a small one fen and a half, January was down a small one fen and seven li and a half, and February and March were each down a small one fen and a half.</p>
<p>The futures wheat market generally presented a weak picture</p>

<h3 id="e52">Chiang Bo-cheng's Remarks <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Issue of the Northwest Army's Allegiance</p>
<p>Treating Individuals Who Return with Utmost Equality</p>
<p>Must Completely Sever Ties with Feng and Lu</p>
<p>Chiang Bo-cheng, Chief of Staff of the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, previously went to Beijing with Li Han-hui, representative of the Northwest Army Sun Lianzhong, to meet with Chairman Chiang and negotiate the issue of allegiance. Mr. Chiang returned to Shanghai a few days ago, while Li remained in Beijing awaiting orders. Our reporter interviewed Mr. Chiang yesterday, and Chiang spoke in detail about the aftermath of the Northwest Army and the central government's policy. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiation Process</p>
<p>Mr. Chiang first described Sun Lianzhong's surrender.</p>
<p>The Negotiation Process Briefly Explained: Sun and Han Fu-qu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, both came from the military and have been friends for twenty years. Sun's personality is frank and forthright, and he has gained Han's trust. This time, Sun first sent a representative to see Han and request surrender, and Han telegraphed Chairman Chiang to strongly recommend it. Then, he and Sun's Chief of Staff, Li Han-hui, went to Beijing to meet Chairman Chiang. Sun's troops consist of four divisions, currently stationed in the Xinxiang and Jiaozuo areas, with a strength of about 20,000 men.</p>
<p>Conditions for Acceptance: Sun's conditions for surrender were (1) to ask the central government to grant him a title; (2) to move his troops to western Shandong; and (3) to have the central government take over the supply of provisions after formal verification. Chairman Chiang expressed that complete acceptance was not a problem. However, Lu Zhonglin and others recently sent representatives, such as Li Xin, to Zhengzhou in the name of the Northwest Army group to negotiate surrender with He Yaozu, and then also came to Beijing to request an audience with the central government.</p>
<p>Central Policy: Chairman Chiang once hosted a banquet for Liu Zhenhua, Li Wuzhong, and others, including himself, expressing sincerely that if the Northwest Army generals completely sever ties with Feng and Lu in their individual capacities, then they will be treated with utmost equality as comrades-in-arms of the central government; otherwise, it would be absolutely difficult to accommodate them. This is the established policy of the central government on the Northwest issue. On the one hand, Li Han-hui was instructed to telegraph Sun Yunzhong for the central government's intention, and a solution should be reached after Chairman Chiang returns to Beijing. He plans to stay in Shanghai for a while and will not return to Jinan for the time being. Li is heading north immediately.</p>
<p>Northwest Pacification Commissioner Li Wuzhong recently visited Shanghai and came to visit today but did not meet him. He expects to go north within a few days. As for Chairman Chiang's meeting with Vice Commander Zhang, he has not heard anything. If it is true, it will be after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee.</p>
<p>Approval of the Naval Treaty</p>
<p>Speeches by the Authorities of Britain, America, and Japan</p>
<p>Broadcast by Radio on the 27th</p>
<p>Shanghai Received a Telephone Call, Probably at Midnight</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported that this morning (the 25th), the Shanghai office of the Philippine Radio Company announced that on the 27th of this month, British Prime Minister MacDonald, U.S. President Hoover, and Japanese Prime Minister Hamaguchi will deliver speeches on the approval of the London Naval Treaty. The company's Manila KBK radio station will relay the broadcast one by one. The wavelength is 44 meters. The time is from 3 pm to 4 pm London time, which is 11 pm to 12 am Shanghai time. The three people will give their speeches in their respective capitals and broadcast them to the world by radio.</p>
<p>Year-End</p>
<p>Accounting Cannot Be Changed</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Submits a Request to the Executive Yuan for Compliance. The Municipal Government submitted a document to the Executive Yuan yesterday, stating: "Submitting a request regarding a request from the Social Affairs Bureau, it is found that since the implementation of the national calendar, the people have been clinging to old habits and have not fully reformed. This is because of the historical relationship of more than 4,000 years, and a reform cannot be easily accomplished in a single day. However, the city's merchants' accounting documents and books mostly follow the national calendar, but regarding the year-end accounting date this year, there are still requests for extensions. For example, the Soybean and Rice Industry Guild and the Rice Milling Industry Guild have both submitted documents to the bureau and have been rejected. However, chambers of commerce in various places have repeatedly requested reports. We believe that there are two things that must be done to promote the national calendar: one is to shift the merchants' accounting period, and the other is to shift the people's entertainment of the abolished lunar New Year. For the former, we propose that you submit to the Executive Yuan to order the provincial and municipal governments to reject all requests from the business community to change the year-end accounting date, so as to ensure that the entire country follows the same standard. For the latter, we should follow Article 1 of the Executive Yuan's order on the implementation of the national calendar. At the beginning of the reform, it is appropriate to have large-scale promotion and publicity so that all citizens can be familiar with it and participate in the reform. However, if this matter is not slightly strengthened and planned in advance, we are afraid that the national calendar New Year will still be bland, and the abolished lunar New Year will be as lively as ever. Therefore, we propose that you appoint government officials and quickly convene representatives from the municipal party headquarters, municipal chamber of commerce, daily newspaper guild, and all subordinate bureaus to set up a meeting to preside over the promotion of the new calendar. All folk ceremonies, celebrations, and entertainment of the abolished lunar New Year should be held around the national calendar New Year in order to change customs, and promote and benefit the implementation. Is it appropriate? We should prepare a document and submit it to you for review and implementation for public convenience, etc. Based on this, we have found that the two points mentioned in the statement that the national calendar must be planned in advance, one is to shift the merchants' accounting date, and the other is to shift the people's entertainment of the abolished lunar New Year, are both essential matters. Regarding the promotion of the New Year of the city's calendar, in addition to instructing the bureau to properly plan it, all submissions rejecting requests from various places to change the year-end accounting period must be transmitted to the whole country to emphasize the reason for the national calendar. We should submit the situation and request your review and implementation for public convenience." Yesterday evening</p>
<p>Ford Aircraft Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Carrying the Tianjin Yong Bao of the Day</p>
<p>A Ford aircraft with three motors and high wing manufactured by the American Ford Company, piloted by Hedden and Creston, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at Hongqiao Airport. Among those who welcomed them were Mr. Crowe, manager of the Shanghai Ford Motor Company, and Mr. Billers, manager of the U.S. Automotive Company. The fuselage of the aircraft is very large, and the whole body is silver-gray. It has twelve seats. It was first shipped from the United States to Japan, and then flew to Korea, Shenyang, and Tianjin. Yesterday morning at 8:30, it flew from Tianjin to Shanghai, landing in Jinan on the way. The pilots had lunch in Jinan at noon and continued flying at 12:20, arriving in Shanghai at 4:30 in the afternoon, carrying many copies of the Tianjin Yong Bao of the day, so that people in Shanghai could learn about the events in Tianjin on that day, which was a very pleasant event. It is said that the aircraft will fly to Hong Kong and the South Seas Islands in a few days. The purpose of this flight is to promote the Ford aircraft market.</p>
