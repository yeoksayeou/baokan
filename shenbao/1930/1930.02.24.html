<h3>犬養殺餘勇可嘉</h3>
<p>電通社　昨夕之犬養毅政友總裁、因選舉大慘敗、頗露沉痛之色、但尙不如其黨員輩之狼狽、以沉重反語口調語云、政友會握天下政權已久、暫讓他人亦屬佳事、政權旣非運動比賽之奬賞銀盃、自無須去年被奪、今年即須奪回、政友會刻已無財力無權力、可以稍稍研究野黨學、未始非苦口良藥、勝敗乃尋常事、悉繫於時運、我並不措意、自信不久當可再握天下之政權也云</p>
<h3>元田肇大發牢騒</h3>

<h3>名士之總選舉觀</h3>
<p>電通社　各方面名士對於總選舉結果、所抱意見如下、永田秀次郎云、民政黨之大捷、蓋由田中内閣之失政與消極干涉選舉所致、而非全國民對於緊縮政策共鳴而得此者、此後視軍縮會議成績、及各業衰敗之深刻化、難免影響、自以保持絕對多數爲佳、宫島清次郎曰、濱口缺乏勇氣、故難望其斷行政策、觀減俸問題即可明瞭、民政黨雖占勝、亦不能懷何大希望、池田成彬氏曰、濱口内閣存續、爲結束金解禁、各業之衰敗、將仍持續也云、</p>
<h3>海縮前途悲觀</h3>
<p>法責英美祇圖敷衍大綱</p>
<p>美指法日破壞倫會禍首</p>
<p>倫敦海軍會議已開四星期、毫無結果、各方悲觀態度、漸見高漲、而法日與英美顯然分立、雙方輿論針鋒相對、茲述法美報紙最近評論如下、</p>
<p>巴黎訊　近日巴黎各報對於倫敦會議之經過及其前途、大抱失望及悲觀態度、如小巴黎人報之駐倫敦訪員求連氏電稱、恐英首相麥唐納難使任何國際協定通過英國會、又謂倫敦政界認會議已到擱淺地位、未必有切實成就、恐結果祇使現有各海軍力鞏固而已、又該報之外交訪員麥賽爾貝氏稱、英美代表顯然爲法國之論據所窘、因其至少將眞爭點充分暴露故也、法方觀察倫敦近事、認爲英美意均圖迫法國抛棄其國防安全之需安、而並不酬以關於地中海或大西洋之安全協定、半官界否認英方所指法國圖阻撓會議之說、謂英美畏討論實際、但敷衍大綱、眞會議之賊耳、巴黎時報之論調尤激、略謂各國宜速抛棄其欲見法人以傀儡自居之妄想、倘列强眞願减軍、應簽訂政治協定、以示其心無他、又法專家謂英國抨繫法國、殊爲可怪、須知一九一四年曾顯示法國之防禦方法、於英有利也云、</p>
<p>紐約訊當地各報對於倫敦會議均持悲觀論調、紐約世界報云、目下各國所努力者、爲締結關於巡洋艦及潛水艦之一協定、而法國要求多量潛水艦、直無異破壞該項協定之進行、日本態度與法相同、而更主對美七成、野心暴露、倫敦會議之失敗、殆可預斷、紐約時報云、潛水艇之即行廢止、縱不易實現、而其噸數之限制、則爲人道上極妥當之主張、法國對此主張而反對之、倫敦會議之根本精神、即因此消失矣、宣傳講壇報云、法日兩國視潛水艦爲其最大武器、殆以此爲對抗英美之策、故廢止論終師失敗、不難預斷而關於他種兵艦之五五三比率、亦斷難成立、要之、破壞倫敦會議者厥爲法日云、（世界社）</p>

<h3>英工黨左派</h3>
<p>贊成印度獨立</p>
<p>英相脫離獨立工黨原因</p>
<p>倫敦訊、麥唐納首相、已辭退獨立工黨之會員地位、據非正式方面言、獨立工黨大半爲左派搆成、邇來左派反對麥氏日甚、麥之脫黨即由於此、據深通政界消息之人觀測、英工黨之戰線、不致因麥氏此舉而分化、但印度問題、爲工黨間之一大困難、預料西門委員團之報告書、雖將主張使印度地方自治大加壙張、但未必主張以屬領自治地位許於印度、而獨立黨則爲印度張目、主張許其獨立之要求、英印間締結一種聨盟、該黨中左派要人白老克威氏盛倡此說、白氏與其一系黨員將本此主張、與政府尤其麥氏爲難云、）</p>

<h3>金貴中之粤市影響</h3>
<p>各項實業均受打擊</p>
<p>廣州通信、金貴銀賤之風潮發生後、吾國工商各業、備受打擊、幾於全國震撼、粤省方面所受影響、亦極巨大、且直接間接影響於吾人生活尤鉅、質言之、即因金價奇貴之故、無形中突然將人民之日常生活程度提高也、爰向有關係方面實地調查、將其情况分誌於下、</p>
<p>米糧　米爲粤省主要糧食、惟本省產米向不敷用、平常豐收之年、亦僅供九個月之需、此外三個月之糧食、即須仰給於安南東京仰光暹羅各地、以故每年洋米入口之數、爲額極鉅、查民國十七年分入口洋米共八千萬擔、以每擔八元計算、共值銀六萬四千萬元、十八年分現雖未得確實統計、然是年因天旱之故、早晚兩熟榖米均告歉收、料洋米入口之額、當比前年數景爲多、洋米多以金爲本位、其從前用銀本位者、如安南等處、現亦改用金制、金價旣漲、米價隨之、以金與銀比例、金約漲四分之一、姑以廣東每年付洋米價銀六萬元計、則今因金貴之故、每年須增付一萬五千萬元、此鉅額金錢乃直接以諸君人者、於日常生活、至有</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>重大影響者也、</p>
<p>麵粉　麵粉雖次於米、而用途極廣、銷額亦大、近年國内製造麵粉廠勃興、挽回外溢利權不少、然細攷它况、則現時國内所産小麥、（即製麵粉之原料）平均計之、僅共一般麵廠六個月之用、此外須由美法坎拿大等國運來接濟、金價漲後、原料價值飛漲、麵粉價格、將亦大受影響、現下因各廠所存原料尚多、暫時不致受重大牽動、然一二月後原料用罄、内地所産又未及接濟、在此青黄不接之時、恐將有飛漲之一日、製麵工業、以此障碍、亦將不免受一重大打擊矣、</p>
<p>洋貨　洋貨營業、近因種種關係、日見困難、連年以來、均無好景、去年尤覺凋零、金價漲後、各項洋貨均隨之漲價、平均估計、約漲價四分之一、洋貨受此意外變動、幾爲根本摇動、其舊日存貨多者、雖能驟獲多金、然來日大難、方興未艾、其前途正未可樂觀也、現下各洋貨行號因金價太高、多不敢向外國定貨、縱買入亦價格過昂、而無人過問、聞市内該行中人稱爲拆家之大洋貨行、最近已倒閉數家、可見其受金貴影響之大矣、</p>
<p>火柴　粤省火柴業、自爲瑞典火柴托辣斯貶價競賣之壓迫、已一蹶不振、近經官民多方維持、乃復重張旗鼓、冀與外貨爲最後之奮鬬、詎意忽遭此空前未有之金漲風潮、所有藥料盒片柴梗各種原料、無不漲價倍蓗、平均計之、約比金價未漲前增高一倍、該業受此打擊、瞻顧前途、殆將絶望矣、</p>
<p>梘業　粤省製梘（即肥皂）工業、近年可稱盛極一時、以廣州市一隅而言、大小梘廠共有二百餘家、然因技術幼穉、設備未週、基本未能鞏固、近遂漸漸爲外貨壓倒、呈衰落之態、現在各項原料、如鹹類香料火酒等、均隨金價飛漲、在平時僅足勉强支持、今受此影響、遂難與外貨爭競、行見内地銷場、不久又將爲外貨奪去、且其中重要原料之鹹類、完全仰給於外國、即此一點、已足爲製梘業之致命傷矣　　金業　粤省金業、可略分之爲兩類、（一）爲三益堂金舖行、以製造金飾器皿爲主要營業、兼鎔煉金葉金條發賣、（一）爲興和堂金銀首飾行、以製造金飾器皿爲主業、兼造紋銀飾器、自金價飛漲後、由四十餘換一躍至五十餘六十換、一般人見此空前未有之高價、對於購買金飾、皆望而却步、因此金行營業一落千丈、其冷淡情况、爲近十餘年來所未見、至於金葉之銷路、現因金貴之故、約減去百分之八十以上、目下各金舖一因金葉銷路太滯、二因金幣價昂、難於化算、已一律停止開爐煉製金葉、（金舖製金葉、皆係用各國之金幣鎔化煉成、）同時又因金貴之故、買金者少、携金飾往鎔賣者多、各金舖恐買入金質過多、將來金價萬一復跌、又受損失、且有買入而無賣出、資本亦難週轉、因此多有暫時不允買入、以目下情形言、金行已受之損失、固甚鉅大、倘長此下去、更難支持矣、</p>
<p>織造　年來粤省織造業、雖備受外貨之壓迫、然一部份尚足支持、如毛巾線襪笠衫土布等、以工價低廉之故、成本較輕、銷數尚稱不惡、惟所用原料、除棉紗一項、有一部份由上海土紗供給外、其餘大部份之棉紗蔴紗冷線等原料、皆須仰給於外國、以廣州市一隅論、每年由英日美各國運來棉紗、值百餘萬元、連蔴紗線紗冷線、當逹數百萬、現下金價旣漲、紗價當隨之而高、今後織造業之前途、又將趨於困境、且上海方面運來之士紗、因各紗廠所用以紡紗之原料、又有一部份須仰給於印度棉、現時各廠存棉、僅數兩月之用、將來存料用罄、勢不得不高價續買、於是成本旣昂、紗價必漲、届時土紗非停止紡造、即提高賣價、織造界雖欲用廉價之土紗而不可得、故織造業之前途、現時頗有黯澹之象、</p>
<p>疋頭　近年疋頭業之種種衰落、已爲社會所稔知、毋庸　述、金貴之風潮起後、益予該業以重大打擊、現全行各店、因金貴如許、决難合算、對於定貨、觀望不前、有僅定些少、藉以應酬門市者、有暫將往年存貨支持門面、絶不再定新貨、以靜觀金價之漲落者有以爲金貴之難關難渡、將營業範圍縮少、以避此潮流者、一時全行頓呈零落之象、惟疋頭行向外國定貨、春夏季貨物、須於春初訂購、秋冬季貨物、須於夏季訂購、今各店旣多數未定貨、將來雖有銷塲、亦將無貨應市、照現時情况推測、在最近之將來、疋頭業難望起色、</p>
<p>以上所述、僅就調查所及關係較大者言之、此外受同樣影響之工商各業、尚不知凡幾、然見微知著、亦足見金貴銀平、影響於吾粤各項實業及民生之一斑矣、</p>

<p>西人會甲組賽</p>
<h3>樂華錦標失望</h3>
<p>一對三敗於海軍</p>
<p>威德西穩得錦標</p>
<p>樂華本届自參加西人會各項比賽以來、每戰必勝、無往不利、一時海上賽隊、爲之側目、所謂高級杯甲組錦標及史高托杯等三大冠軍、幾乎有捨我其誰之趨勢、乃者一敗於威西德、而高級杯之前途告絶、昨再敗於海軍、而甲組之錦標失望、三大冠軍已去其二、此後希望、則在努力爭奪唯一之史高托杯冠軍耳、</p>
<p>威德西穩得錦標　樂華昨日失手於海軍、間接爲威德西造福、按威德西歴經大敵、所有最後一次之比賽者、惟葡萄牙耳、葡居各隊之末、遠非威西德之敵手、其敗也必矣、是則威德西將挾甲組錦標之榮譽、乘風破浪而去、直意中事耳</p>
<p>樂華失敗原因　千軍易得、一將難求、我於樂華最近二次之失敗、未必非馮運佑缺席之故也、馮在海上諸内衛中、固亦一時之選、奈何竟遭天忌、負傷休養、自此内部去失桂石、力量大减、前鋒進取精神、問受應嚮、馮如在塲、則高級杯之前途甲組錦標之希望、至今固大有把握也、馮之進退、於一隊之關係巨矣、然其餘諸人、　李惠堂·周賢言·孫思敬三數人外、多覺較前减色、是否球藝退化、抑或輕敵自大、二次失敗、咎由自取、雖然失之東隅、收之桑愉、亡羊補牢、爲時未晚、勉哉樂華、其努力猛進、當知今日之失敗、實爲良好之敎訓、亦他日成功之基礎也、</p>
<p>二隊比賽經過　自裁判員麥雪兒宣佈開戰以來、海軍迎日作戰、頗有精彩、初樂華三試身手、未利而退、五分鐘後、王左翼傳中、陳家球面對空門、舉足攻打、力弱勢緩、被守者擋出、中部三將重行人攻、迫成角球、王踢角球、孫思敬猛然一脚、高越門外、此後海軍聲勢大盛、活動異常、惟在射緊要之處、每多浪費、最後五分鐘内、安原生二次失足、造成大錯、先後被海軍開恩德的飛各中一球、上半時海軍以二比○占先、下半時開塲、樂葉精神飽足、滿冀反敗爲勝、何奈敵軍勢盛、球之所趨、每爲其所得、不能任心所欲、偶有平反機會、非操之過急、即失之太緩、隨時隨地、均成過眼烟眼、廻非往昔樂華之本色矣、幸而在三十分鐘左右、陳鎭和奮勇當先、參加前鋒作戰、不久即爲樂華撲入一球、免遭全軍覆滅之慘禍、而樂華軍心亦爲之一壯、斯時樂華果能加緊工作、或有轉機之希望、然而海軍横加壓迫、較前益甚、最後三分鐘内、又見德的飛打人一球、而樂華遂以一對三失敗、申園數千觀衆、莫不掃興而歸、</p>
<p>又昨日西捕隊與上海隊在跑馬廳作甲組比賽、結果西捕以三對二勝上海、</p>

<h3>陳德徵對</h3>
<p>晉閻蒸電之糾正</p>
<p>本市敎育局舉行第六次紀念週時、該局局長陳德徵氏、對於糾正晋閻蒸電之荒謬有重要演說、其辭如次、</p>
<p>最近幾天的時局、趁這機會、作一扼要的報告、大家知道國民革命軍陸海空副司令閻錫山先生、在十號發出一電、電中大槪說國家連年有内戰、各方感受痛苦很深因此主張消弭内戰、對於國是、可在野負責等等、所以閻錫山就想買起船票來、並約蔣主席也買船票、關於這點、在腦筋靈敏的人、已經感到有山雨欲來風滿樓的樣子、在腦筋遲鈍些的人看來、或將認爲好像是倡導仁風、閻百川先生的蒸電、究竟内中有甚麽用意、固無暇去考察、他的影響如何、也未嘗仔細的想過、可是以黨的立塲來講閻百川先生之蒸電、實在十分不妥、我把不妥的理由、申說如次、第一黨員須要認清責任、黨員原來是不容易做的做了黨員、他所有一切言論思想動作、便當受黨的節制、聽黨的指揮個人的言論思想行動、那没有自由可言、因爲凡屬黨員、在未得黨籍以前、對於黨的主義、早給他以長時間的充分的自由權在那裏考慮做了黨員、分明身已許黨不復屬諸私人、當然只有服從黨的决議、聽從黨的命令、因此閻百川先生講出像蒸電的話來、實在是遠背了黨紀、老實說、整個的黨、把很大的責任、交與閻百川先生、他如果是本黨同志、自應以黨的意思爲意思、如果他自認是總理信徒的話、便該恪遵總理的遺訓、量是閻百川先生却仍把個人的自由看得很重、黨的紀律、看得很輕、並且要革命領袖蔣介石同志、也跟着一起出洋、這不惟是笑話、而且是顯然違反了黨的紀律的行動、第二、黨員須要明瞭黨的組織、閻百川先生倡聨合三届執監會、狂發（黨事交黨人·國事交國人·）的論調、可見他不明事理到極點·實在違背黨治精神、姑以事實來說、從前汪精衛爲聨合桂系西山會議派在南京組織中央特别委員會、希圖僭竊黨權、炫惑觀聽、但終究因爲缺乏根據、爲全國人民所不齒、一刹那即歸消滅、過往的歷史、已經告訴我們如此的清楚、故知如有蔑視黨的系統和歷史的、一定會得失敗的、倘使可以集合第一·第二·第三次的執監委員來商議解决黨是、那麽國事便也可以延聘以前的宣統皇帝和逃了的吳佩孚·張宗昌、躱了的段祺瑞共同來商議解决了、這非不明黨的組織、抹煞黨的歷史而何、第三、說到國家政治方面、此時正是百端待舉一切反動勢力等待削平之際、這種時候、中國所賴以維繫者、中央之鎭靜、元首之運籌而已、要是中樞稍有變動、元首稍存消極的念頭、民族的生存、便會遭受很大的打擊、在事實上、我們深曉得目前這種内憂外患相迫而來的危急的中國局勢、除出了蔣主席以外、試問誰能擔起這樣的憂苦艱辛的重大責任、而閻百川先生却要主張禮讓爲國在野負責、眞不知其居心何在、所以在國家民族的立塲上、便可以看出閻錫山主張之謬誤、而應受黨的嚴重制裁的、第四、閻錫山是最高官吏、受有國家的委任、並且於一月二十二日在總理遺像前補行副司令宣誓就職典禮那料僅隔十九天、而他的意思、突然改變、說什麽（禮讓爲國·在野負責·）等語、如果閻先生眞要在野負責、那末、何必在十九天之前宣誓、負起在朝的那樣大的責任呢、旣已宣過誓就職了、便該十二分的努力、以報黨國付託之重才行呀、我們知道、凡是官吏、大如一國元首、小至縣政府的錄事受了國家政府的委任只有服從、没有第二句話可講、豈有誓詞未乾、連這普通的義務丨服從、都不知道、那要丢棄的道理、第五、閻百川要講禮讓、却不肯獨唱、偏要强拉人家作伴、這種跡近脅迫和要挾的動作、擬以古代的歷史、直等於曹操逼宫、這種反動的行爲、是不是負有國家重大使命者所應做的、大家知道、閻百川是信服孔子之道的就以孔子之道來講罷、孔子一生的敎訓莫非（忠）（恕）兩字、所謂忠、忠於民族、所謂恕、即是己所勿欲、勿施於人、要是閭先生的部下　商震孫楚單、早得一年半載、也發一個電報說我們要禮讓爲國、請閻百公下野負責、我想閻先生一定要怒氣冲天了、自己不願意部下做的事情、而却要在長官的身上千犯起國家紀綱來、閻先生其何以自解呵、總之、一個負有重大責任的官吏、對於元首有此行爲、直是蔑棄國家綱維、破壞黨的紀律、昧於本身底義務、有虧一己的職守、由此可知閻的蒸電、無一是處</p>
<p>我曾講過、永久的和平基礎建築在統一的國家上而、如其不以統一爲和平之基礎、這和平是假的如或以和平爲號召、反含其他企圖、不但是假和平簡直是和平的罪人、所謂統一、是建築在全國上下一德一心的基礎上、不然、你想苟且、我想倖免、你想豪奪、我想巧取、那怎能維持眞的和平呢、而且目下的和平、眞要大家去拚命、才可獲取、如高唱禮讓、國家的紛亂、一定馬上會實現、老實說禮讓之說、就算通過去、也只好在太平時候適用現在下百平逆討亂努力奮鬬的時期、如何可以唱出這種論調呢、</p>
<p>國家多難時、人民應該起來講話、官吏失態時、人民也應該起來講話、現在閻百川這樣的失態、全市民衆、不該沉默着一話不講呀、我們以敎育民衆爲職責的、對此更應有十足的注意十足的努力呵、</p>

<p>上海大霧後</p>
<p>昨日天氣燠熱</p>
<p>氣候和暖有如暮春</p>
<p>霧阻各輪均已開滬</p>
<p>去冬氣候大寒、爲近年來所未有、冰雪連天、不知春來何日也、乃自立春以來、天時轉變、雨霧間作、嚴冬氣象、頓然變換、惟前昨兩日霧大特甚、吳淞口外、竟有失事船隻、即在本埠馬路上往來車輛亦因霧重各生戒心、速度不敢過高、至昨日之温度、則又爲近數年來希有、嚮午之時、增至七十八度之高、重裘在身、莫不揮汗、即穿着棉衣者、亦覺燠熱異常、五月天氣、不是過也、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>釣船被寗興輪撞沉　前日吳淞口大霧、直至昨晨天將破曉時、方始消散、有寗波釣船金同安、於前日上午五時許、自滬滿載糧食貨物、駛行抵淞、經吳淞榮太稅行報關、正擬啓椗出口、詎於八時許起、大霧迷漫、該船深恐航行危險、遂下錨停泊於浦東三叉頭港附近、以待霧散開行、不意至昨晨二時許、有寗紹公司之寗興輪船、自三夾水外駛行進口、因該船停泊處爲霧阻隔、未爲寗興所見、致被寗興將該船之船頭撞斷、全船即爲海水灌入、船夥等見勢不佳、當即將船駛靠淺灘、但不久即行沉没、該船共有船夥六人、均墜落水中、時在深夜濃霧之際、附近船隻均不敢救援、幸有吳淞救生局巡船、適在江中往來梭巡、聞船夥等呼救之聲、當即冐險循聲駛至失事處、將船夥等逐一救護出險、昨晨大霧消散後、金同安船夥即乘尖小划、至出事處檢點破船、於潮落後已浮擱水面、而船中所裝貨物、則均已漂失、損失頗爲不資、業已據情報告張華浜河泊司、一面向寗興輪交涉云、又前晚十一時有一菜船因失道而誤觸石堤致遭傾覆幸未傷人、</p>
<p>霧阻商輪全到上海　二十一及二十二日兩天本埠發生大霧、在吳淞口外海面被阻之江海各輪、有經阻至二十小時以上者、迨至昨晨、各商輪於霧退之後、始陸續開滬、自上午六時半起至下午三時止、此數小時中、吳淞口開進之商輪、、共計逹四十二艘、其中有揚子江來滬者十船、南北洋及沿海各口岸來滬者十八艘、白日本及外洋來滬者有十四艘云、而出口輪在吳淞外所阻滯者、亦均於昨晨八時出口、</p>
<p>霧勢甚重多年未見　昨晨大霧更重、各馬路上行走、在二三十步内、竟難辯明、且天氣甚爲熱悶、上午六時許起、至正午十二時止、忽雨忽晴者數次、至午後雖係放晴、惟天氣如三春氣候、熱悶異常、上海泰晤士報云、星期六晚間七時許、本埠曾遇非常重霧、爲多年所未見、但吳淞霧勢更重、幾乎咫尺莫辯、且自下午四時以後、即已大霧鎖江、竟致發生沙船撞穿輪船奇事、據聞是日四時後、有某沙船載絲及雜貨進口、忽與另一沙船相撞、於是又撞及一小火輪、該輪竟爲之撞成一孔、但幸未下沉、亦無溺水者、沙船上則有舟子兩人駭極自行躍入江内、其後一人爲過舟拯起、一人竟溺斃、迄於傍晚、尸身猶未尋獲、沙船當然亦受重傷、以致頭艙進水、貨物多受水漬、小輪則旣經洞穿、乃發號求援、旋由滬上派一拖輪前往拖至安全地方、</p>

Xu Zongwu and Yang Ri led the remnants across the river in Guixian. Halfway across, they were bombarded by our naval guns, resulting in countless casualties. (2) In the battles of Beiliu and Xingye, the Zhang and Gui rebel armies were completely defeated, with over 8,000 rebel officers and soldiers captured, over 7,000 enemy firearms seized, and 50 or more water-cooled machine guns and mortars captured, along with countless military supplies. (3) After this defeat, the rebel enemy has lost all their strength, with less than 5,000 remaining troops. Our army is currently conducting a search and suppression operation in several directions. (4) Chen Jitang telegraphed a prominent figure, stating that the main force of Zhang and Gui has completely collapsed and has no ability to counterattack. The situation in Guangxi is settled, and the suppression of the Deng Longguang rebel force, which has fled to the southern route, is imminent. Due to the threat from our naval and land forces, they are now retreating towards the Guangxi border one after another. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Current Commentary</h3>
<p>Victory of the Minseitō (Constitutional Democratic Party) in the Japanese Election</p>
<p>The landslide victory of the Minseitō in the Japanese general election is now evident. Consequently, the victors boast about the fairness of the election, attributing their success to accumulated merit, while the losers console themselves with the unpredictability of fortune and blame the victors for winning through machinations. This is the usual state of affairs, with the successful rejoicing and the unsuccessful enraged, and is not worth dwelling upon. However, the pronouncements of responsible figures warrant attention. According to sources within the victorious government, the Minseitō's sweeping victory was due to Interior Minister Adachi's extremely skillful control of the election. The election authorities should only act according to the law and prevent malfeasance; there is no such thing as skillfulness or lack thereof. Furthermore, Interior Minister Adachi issued a statement saying that the government allowed the proletarian parties to advocate their doctrines because the people knew that their doctrines were impractical and would lead to such a failure. We find it difficult to understand the Interior Minister's intent. Is he expressing regret for supporting the proletarian parties, or is he subtly satirizing the impracticability of proletarian doctrines? Or is he preemptively expressing goodwill to the proletarian parties lest they become dissatisfied with the government? The true intent of the Interior Minister's statement remains unclear, and the wording is very skillful. As for Inukai Tsuyoshi, from the defeated Seiyūkai (Friends of Constitutional Government) side, he said that political power is not like a sporting competition where one can win a trophy; it is good that the Seiyūkai, which has held power for a long time, is temporarily yielding it to others, and it can take some time to study the party's doctrine, confident that it can regain power soon. He is right to say that political power is not comparable to a trophy in a competition. It is also right to take a sabbatical to study the party's doctrine. However, his statement that power is temporarily yielded to others and will soon be regained reveals Inukai's eagerness for power. In fact, the role of a political party does not necessarily require holding power; being in opposition can monitor the government's actions, correct the government's errors, and can also motivate the government and the party. Its effect is no different from being in power. If the sole purpose is to seize power, then there will be endless contention. It is regrettable that the leaders of the Seiyūkai have not yet realized this.</p>
<p>In conclusion, political parties, regardless of victory or defeat, should only encourage themselves. If victorious and in power, they should further clarify their politics and show sincerity to the people in everything they do, and not resort to trickery and deception, lest they repeat the mistakes of the previous cabinet. If defeated and in opposition, they should further train their party members, cultivate party ethics, and fulfill their duties, without harboring any intention of destroying the opposing party. Only then will they be closer to the ideal.</p>

<h3>International Telecommunications</h3>
<p>Japanese General Election</p>
<p>Final Victory Determined</p>
<p>Minseitō Occupies More Than Half of the Seats</p>
<p>Temporary Parliament to be Convened in Mid-April</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 23rd: The final results of the general election are as follows: Minseitō 273 seats, Seiyūkai 174 seats, Labour-Farmer Party 5 seats, Independents 5 seats, other parties 9 seats in total. The government party has achieved a great victory this time. It is said that the reason for this is not so much that the current government has won the trust of the people as that the previous Seiyūkai government lost the hearts of the people too much. However, since the current government came to power in July of last year, it has repeatedly achieved success in the economic field, and the people have deepened their trust in the government's talent and sincerity. This is generally recognized. However, today, if the government wants to maintain the support of the people, it will have to change its financial and economic policies. Since the implementation of the austerity movement, commerce has greatly declined and the number of unemployed has increased. It is necessary to remedy this. Furthermore, the results of the London naval conference are also closely related to the government. If this conference were to fail, the government's prestige would be greatly reduced. The characteristics of this election are that the Minseitō won a large majority, the Labour-Farmer Party suffered a major setback, and the Independents also won very few seats. The latter two were unexpected. The failure of the Labour-Farmer Party was due to the infighting between the left and right wings of the party. The sharp reduction in the number of Independents shows that the people are tired of associating with speculative candidates. A total of 10,418,000 votes were cast this time. The Minseitō received 5,620,000 votes, the Seiyūkai received 3,866,000 votes, the Labour-Farmer Party received 504,000 votes, the Independents received 240,000 votes, and other parties received a total of 195,000 votes. In the last general election, there were a total of 9,790,000 votes cast, the Minseitō received 4,212,000, the Seiyūkai received 4,242,000, the Labour-Farmer Party received 451,000, the Independents received 635,000, and the other parties received 1,147,000.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency: The special parliament is scheduled to convene in mid-April. The position of Speaker will belong to Mr. Fujisawa no-Suke of the Minseitō. The position of Vice-Speaker may still be held by Ichiro Kiyose. The two participating officials, Uchizaki and Yamashike, will probably be replaced after the election is finalized.</p>
<h3>Adachi Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Saying Tanaka's Two Years of Tyranny Led to Today's Result</p>
<p>Nichi-Rensha, Tokyo, 23rd: Interior Minister Adachi issued the following statement late at night on the 22nd: "The general trend has been decided, and there is no doubt about the victory of our party. The results of this general election show that the former Tanaka cabinet's tyranny during the past two years has made the people extremely disgusted with the Seiyūkai. In this general election, the people sympathize with the policies of the Minseitō. The defeat of the Seiyūkai is the result of the people's punishment of their many years of accumulated evils. The number of proletarian parties elected is comparatively small because the government allowed them to advocate their doctrines, and the people know that their doctrines are impractical, leading to this result. Finally, I hope that the Seiyūkai will reflect on their own mistakes, restore full credibility, and challenge our party with dignity in the next general election."</p>
<h3>Inukai Kills with Commendable Courage</h3>
<p>Domei News Agency: Last night, the President of the Seiyūkai, Inukai Tsuyoshi, showed a great deal of sorrow because of the disastrous defeat in the election, but he was not as disoriented as his party members. He said in a heavy and ironic tone: "The Seiyūkai has held the power of the country for a long time. It is also a good thing to temporarily yield it to others. Political power is not a sports competition with a prize trophy. There is no need to be snatched away last year and snatched back this year. The Seiyūkai now has no financial resources or power. It may not be a bad thing to study the learning of an opposition party, and it may be a good medicine. Victory or defeat is a common thing and depends entirely on fate. I am not concerned about it. I am confident that I will soon be able to regain the power of the country."</p>
<h3>Motoda Hajime Makes a Big Fuss</h3>
<p>Domei News Agency: The news of Motoda Hajime's defeat in the election caused a great shock on all sides. Motoda himself told reporters in Okitsu last night with a sad expression: "In my constituency, because Kiyose Kikumo ran as a candidate, I thought about giving way to the younger generation. However, the campaigners said that I should not invade other people's territory, so I had this loss. From the very beginning of the parliament until today, Inukai, Ozaki, and I have been members every year. This year, I am the only one who failed to be elected. The corruption in the political world has also made me disgusted. It is a good time to retire. I plan to visit Saionji tomorrow to discuss everything. It is rumored that I will be appointed as an imperial appointee, but I should not accept it from the Minseitō cabinet."</p>
<h3>General Election Views of Celebrities</h3>
<p>Domei News Agency: The opinions of celebrities on all sides regarding the results of the general election are as follows: Hideshiro Nagata said, "The Minseitō's landslide victory was caused by the Tanaka Cabinet's misgovernment and passive interference in the election, and not by the nationwide resonance with the austerity policy. It is difficult to avoid the impact after this, depending on the results of the military reduction conference and the deepening of the decline of various industries. It is best to maintain an absolute majority." Kiyojiro Miyajima said, "Hamaguchi lacks courage, so it is difficult to expect him to implement policies decisively. This can be clearly seen from the salary reduction issue. Although the Minseitō has won, there is not much hope." Akibumi Ikeda said, "With the Hamaguchi Cabinet continuing, the abolition of the gold standard and the decline of various industries will continue."</p>
<h3>Pessimistic Outlook on Naval Reduction</h3>
<p>France Accuses Britain and America of Merely Paying Lip Service to the Outline</p>
<p>America Points to France and Japan as the Main Culprits Destroying the London Conference</p>
<p>London Naval Conference has been in session for four weeks, without any results. Pessimism is rising from all sides, and France and Japan are clearly standing apart from Britain and America. The public opinion of both sides is sharply opposed. The following is a summary of recent comments from French and American newspapers:</p>
<p>Paris Dispatch: Parisian newspapers recently expressed deep disappointment and pessimism about the progress and future of the London Conference. For example, Mr. Qiu Lian, the London correspondent of Le Petit Parisien, telegraphed that he feared Prime Minister MacDonald would have difficulty getting any international agreement passed by the British Parliament. He also said that political circles in London believe that the conference has reached a standstill and is unlikely to achieve substantial results, fearing that the outcome will only consolidate existing naval power. In addition, Mr. Maisaibei, the newspaper's diplomatic correspondent, said that the British and American representatives were clearly embarrassed by the French arguments, because they at least fully exposed the real issues. French observers of recent events in London believe that Britain and the United States are trying to force France to abandon its need for national security, without providing security agreements regarding the Mediterranean or the Atlantic. Semi-official circles deny the British claim that France is trying to obstruct the conference, saying that Britain and the United States are afraid to discuss reality, but merely pay lip service to the outline, and are the real enemies of the conference. The tone of Le Temps of Paris is even more intense, stating that countries should quickly abandon their delusions of seeing France as a puppet. If the powers truly wish to reduce armaments, they should sign a political agreement to show that they have no other intentions. French experts also said that it is strange that Britain is criticizing France. It must be known that 1914 showed that France's defense methods are beneficial to Britain.</p>
<p>New York Dispatch: Local newspapers are generally pessimistic about the London Conference. The New York World said that the current efforts of various countries are to conclude an agreement on cruisers and submarines, but France's demand for a large number of submarines is tantamount to undermining the progress of the agreement. Japan's attitude is the same as that of France, and it is even more ambitious to advocate 70% against the United States, exposing its ambitions. The failure of the London Conference is almost predictable. The New York Times said that although the immediate abolition of submarines is not easy to achieve, the restriction of their tonnage is a very appropriate proposal from a humanitarian point of view. France opposes this proposal, and the fundamental spirit of the London Conference is thus lost. The Propaganda Forum said that France and Japan regard submarines as their greatest weapon, and almost use this as a strategy to confront Britain and the United States, so it is not difficult to predict that the abolition theory will eventually fail, and it is also impossible to establish a ratio of 5:5:3 for other warships. In short, France and Japan are the ones who are destroying the London Conference. (World Press)</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 23rd: The new Minister of the Navy, Sarraul, fully supports France's position at the London Naval Conference and will now attend the conference with Briand as France's representative.</p>
<h3>British Labor Party Left Wing</h3>
<p>Supports Indian Independence</p>
<p>Reasons for British Prime Minister Leaving the Independent Labor Party</p>
<p>London Dispatch: Prime Minister MacDonald has resigned his membership in the Independent Labor Party. According to informal sources, most of the Independent Labor Party is made up of leftists. Recently, the leftists have become increasingly opposed to MacDonald, and his departure from the party is due to this. According to those who are familiar with political circles, the British Labor Party's battle line will not be divided by MacDonald's move, but the Indian issue is a major difficulty among the Labor Party. It is expected that the Simon Commission's report will advocate greatly expanding local autonomy in India, but it may not advocate granting dominion status to India, while the Independent Party speaks for India and advocates granting its demands for independence. The party advocates that Britain and India should conclude a kind of alliance, and Mr. Bai Laokewei, an important figure on the left wing of the party, strongly advocates this view. Mr. Bai and his affiliated party members will use this proposal to make things difficult for the government, especially MacDonald. (World Press)</p>

<h3>Establishment of a New British Political Party</h3>
<p>The Result Will Split the Conservative Party and Help the Liberal and Labor Parties. Reuters, London, 22nd: The newly established United Empire Party, which planned to raise £100,000 for election expenses a few days ago, has now announced that it has received donations of £4,000. Politicians are paying attention to the development of this new party. The Conservative Party issued a small booklet yesterday, stating that Conservative Party leader Baldwin has stated his intention to devote himself to free trade within the Empire, but responsible politicians cannot ignore the difficulties: (1) Overseas autonomous dominions are unwilling to accept free trade; (2) The main source of income for royal colonies is tariffs; (3) Colonies have various treaties and agreements on trade, which will be abolished if free trade is implemented; (4) The trusteeship conditions for British-administered territories do not allow the territories to join the scope of free trade. The only result of the actions of the initiators of the new party is to split the Conservative Party and help the Liberal and Labor Parties.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 23rd: The government is now issuing 4.5% public bonds, with actual receipts of 95, to be repaid from 1940 to 1944. Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden's fundraising for this public bond was also unexpected by Londoners. It was found that the government issued 5% public bonds once last November, and the results were quite good. This time, the same method as last time is still used, but the last time was full receipt.</p>

<p>Americans Exclude Filipinos</p>
<p>Filipinos Exclude Japanese</p>
<p>San Francisco Dispatch: The movement of Americans in California to hate Filipinos is growing stronger. Filipinos in various parts of the state have petitioned American officials for protection, and at the same time, they have vigorously advocated Philippine independence. Also, in the Stockton area, Filipinos have begun to reject Japanese goods, saying that the Japanese help Americans and despise Filipinos. Recently, a Japanese woman married a Filipino, and the woman's parents forced them to separate, causing great anger among the Filipinos, which led to an anti-Japanese trend. Filipinos used to buy a lot of Japanese goods, so Japanese expatriates are quite uneasy. The Japanese consul in San Francisco sternly warned the Japanese not to conflict with the Filipinos.

<h3>Central Propaganda Department Issues a Letter to Compatriots</h3>
<p>(Continued 3)</p>
<p>If we carefully read the history of our country for the past few thousand years, it is nothing more than a record of cyclical retaliation and mutual killing. The fundamental reason is that no one can formulate a long-term peace and security and implement a policy without drawbacks. Even if there are occasional brilliant insights, they are ultimately lost in obscurity because there is no common belief and consistent adherence. Therefore, anyone who possesses a portion of military force, knowing how to take advantage of the situation, can steal and hold power, claim to be alone and wise, and take pride in himself. When his great wish is about to be fulfilled, those who want to replace him are already watching from the side. This cycle continues endlessly. Until recent times, the Premier of our party examined the trends of the world and understood the needs of the people. He knew that individuals were not enough to speak of governance and that closing the country was not enough to survive. Therefore, he concentrated his thoughts and plans for saving the country under a system and formed a great Three Principles of the People. He concentrated the people who shared these thoughts and plans under an organization and formed the Kuomintang of China. With the power of the party, he ensured the implementation of the doctrine. Therefore, there is today's political tutelage. Therefore, the Kuomintang of China and China have become a relationship of shared survival. If we can uphold the doctrine of the Kuomintang, China will survive. Otherwise, it will inevitably fall into the original state of mutual killing in the past and even perish. Therefore, we know that only those who can uphold the Premier's doctrine and have the party's deep history and are consistent from beginning to end can have claims about the party and can promote the inevitable implementation of their claims. If there is no clear understanding of the doctrine, no strict adherence to the party, no determination to work hard for political tutelage, only knowing how to take advantage of the situation and cater to and seek gain from people, and being willing to change one's position and be disloyal, then to shamelessly make empty and irresponsible claims without history or life is only to see their irrelevance and lack of self-assessment. In short, revolution and feudalism are absolutely incompatible. Individuals and the central government are also completely different matters. Taking the individual as the center,劫持劫持 a part of the country's military force, occupying the local area, exploiting the people, and disregarding the safety of the country is a feudal force. Receiving the orders of the party, following the Premier's teachings, fighting for the benefit of the country and the people, and contributing one's own rights and freedom to the central government as a whole are revolutionary party members. Feudal forces are combined by individual rights and disintegrate by individual rights. Therefore, the departure and stay of individuals is the key to their fate and growth. Revolutionary party members work according to the wishes of the people. If the country is not destroyed or the species is extinct, the task of the revolution will not end. Their departure and stay are not up to them. What our compatriots need most today is revolution or feudalism? If the world thinks that feudalism is beneficial, then please, those who resist the central government and seek peaceful unification should quickly put on a yellow robe, change the era name to the south, welcome Puyi to the abandoned capital, and return to the old system of the perished Qing Dynasty. If we think that the powers must be overthrown, the nation must be independent, civil rights must be extended, and people's livelihood must be stable, then the revolutionary claims of our party must be followed immediately, and there must be no hesitation or hesitation. What are the revolutionary claims of our party? It is peaceful unification and the vigorous implementation of political tutelage. In order to ensure true peaceful unification, the current soldiers must thoroughly realize that they should not use people to plot feudalism, and they should not be used by people as a tool for feudalism. They must absolutely support the central government and become the people's military force. If so, the country's crisis can be saved, the people's difficulties can be solved, and political tutelage can proceed smoothly. This realization can not only redeem itself, but also prevent the re-emergence of other feudal evil forces. The time for China to soar is not far away. If it is said that the situation is beyond my strength, no one is wiser than me, party discipline can be destroyed, national law can be trampled on, the people can be exploited, and the country can be disregarded, stubbornly adhering to heresy and acting alone, it is creating chaos. Those who create chaos are national thieves, and all my compatriots can rise up and destroy them.</p>
<h3>Cheng Tianfang Assumes Anhui Governorship</h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Cheng Tianfang, a member of the Anhui Provincial Government and Director of Education, was recently appointed by the National Government as Acting Director of Civil Affairs and Governor of Anhui Province. Cheng, considering the numerous issues in Anhui, was unwilling to accept this arduous task and immediately took a steamer to Nanjing to firmly decline the concurrent positions with Chairman Chiang. Currently, the central government has appointed Wang Zhijue as Director of Civil Affairs of the Executive Yuan, likely in response to Cheng's request. However, due to various reasons, the appointment of the provincial governor has not yet been officially announced. Cheng had no choice but to reluctantly accept the difficult task and returned to the province on a small Wuhu steamer around 8:00 PM on the 20th. After disembarking, Cheng immediately entered the city. Wu Xingya, eager to assume his new post in Hubei, repeatedly telegraphed Cheng to return to Anhui as soon as possible to take over. Now that Cheng has returned to the province, Wu strongly urged him to take office. Today (the 21st) at 3:00 PM, Cheng assumed the position of Acting Governor in the Provincial Government Auditorium. The ceremony was simple. Also, since the newly appointed Director of Civil Affairs, Wang Zhijue, needs time to come to Anhui to assume his new post, Cheng will have to temporarily serve concurrently until Wang arrives. Therefore, Duan was sent to the Civil Affairs Department to take over in advance. The position of Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, since Wu Xingya became Acting Governor, has been filled by Li Suixian, the secretary of the Civil Affairs Department. Now that Li must accompany Wu to Hubei, a replacement needs to be selected urgently. Cheng has also temporarily appointed Li Zhongxiang, the original secretary of the Education Department, as the Acting Secretary-General of the Provincial Government. After Cheng took office, Wu Xingya, having discharged his responsibilities, took the Anfeng gunboat at 3:30 PM in the afternoon and sailed downriver to Nanjing to meet Chairman Chiang and seek instructions on everything before going to Hubei to assume his new post.

<h3>Zhang Qun's Aide Attacked in Fujian</h3>
<p>Suspect, Ni Danqi, Apprehended</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After Zhang Qun and Yang Shuzhuang arrived in Fujian, they held banquets for several days with important figures from the political and military circles, including Chen Jiliang, Lin Zhong, Sa Fuchou, Yu Bangyan, Wu Xuan, Yang Yugu, and Guo Yongrong, at the Dongyao Guest House, the Zhongzhou Naval Office, the Shuibu Naval Club, the Wangzhuang Letianquan Bathhouse, and the Guangyulou Restaurant in Hanxia Island, to discuss solutions to the Fujian situation. There was already a breakthrough. On the 17th, Guo Shihui, a member of Zhang's entourage, and Yang Yugu, representing Lu's forces, went to Yanping to contact Lu Xingbang regarding the amnesty for the provincial committee members. The people of Fuzhou thought that the long-depressed situation in Fujian would soon improve. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 18th, a violent incident occurred on Xiaduji Street, where Zhang was attacked, and his aide was injured. The details of the incident are described below:</p>
<p>On the 18th, Zhang accepted an invitation from Yang Shuzhuang, Chen Jiliang, and others, and went to Changqing Temple on Yishan Mountain outside the West Gate at 9:00 AM for sightseeing and had a vegetarian meal and took photos at the temple. At around 4:00 PM, as the important figures were about to disperse, Zhang was also planning to take his aides back to the guest house to rest. It happened that Guo Yongrong, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, hosted a banquet for Zhang at the Longshen Money Exchange on Xiahang Street that night and invited Chen Jiliang and others to accompany him. Zhang ordered his car, with his aide Li Zhongxing and guards, to return to the headquarters first, while Zhang and Chen switched to Guo's car and went out of Nantai around the root of the West Gate city wall. Unexpectedly, when Li's car arrived at the entrance of Taiping Alley in Xiaduji, at about 6:00 PM, five young men in Western suits, seeing the guest house's official car, assumed that Zhang Qun must be inside and furiously attacked with pistols. The driver, Yi San, a resident of Nanchengbian, was hit by three bullets in the legs and back and could not start the engine. The car stopped, and the bullets came closer. Li Zhongxing was also hit by a bullet in the thigh. Fortunately, Li was also brave and immediately took out his pistol and jumped out of the car with the guards to chase after the attackers. Among the five attackers, one was hit by a bullet that entered his ear and fell to the ground. The other four fled desperately in the direction of the alley. Liu Huangji, the leader of the Taiwan group stationed at the Provincial Defense Headquarters, Hong Rui, a patrol officer of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and a news police officer each led detectives and police officers to rush to the scene. Shao Zhicheng, the director of the Fifth Precinct, received a phone call from the Xiaduji sub-station and also arrived with patrol officers and police chiefs to report the incident to Zhang and Director Guo while personally inspecting the scene of the incident. A No. 3 pistol, two bullets, and a hand grenade were found on the attacker's body. Zhang Qun, seeing that his aide Li and the driver were seriously injured, immediately ordered them to be taken to the Boai Hospital for treatment. The attacker who was shot was named Ni Zhanqi. Last year, he was arrested for distributing reactionary leaflets in Nanmen. He was taken to the Municipal Bureau in another car and was dying with a pale face. Doctors Yao and Fang from the Public Security Bureau Hospital were invited to the bureau to give him a sedative and painkiller injection and perform surgery. The attacker gradually regained his voice and groaned, repeatedly calling out that he was in pain and cold. He was covered with a cotton blanket and sent to the Municipal Bureau Hospital in Busicheng. Zhang Qun and Director Guo were very calm and still went to the banquet. After 8:00 PM, from Guoqiao in Cangqian Mountain to the Xiagjie area, Li Yinxia, the director of the detective department of the Provincial Defense Department, and Dong Xiuxiang, the captain of the detective team of the Municipal Bureau, each led special agents, team leaders, detectives, and police officers, fully armed. Xue Lianyu, the captain of the First Security Team, Li Fu, the captain of the Second Security Team, and officers and soldiers of the Provincial Defense Special Service Company and the Marine Corps of the Naval Headquarters were stationed and guarded along the way, with extreme strictness. On the 19th, the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent a judicial clerk to the hospital to question Ni Danqi. According to his confession, he is a student at the San Yi Middle School in Cangqian Mountain. The attack was decided at the Duihu Conference in Cangqian Mountain on the 15th of this month.

<h3>The Impact of Gold's High Price in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>All Kinds of Industries are Affected</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the trend of gold's high price and silver's low price began, various industries in our country have been severely affected, shaking almost the entire country. The impact on Guangdong Province is also extremely significant, directly and indirectly affecting our lives to a great extent. In short, due to the extraordinarily high price of gold, the standard of living of the people has suddenly increased invisibly. Therefore, I have conducted on-the-spot investigations with relevant parties and recorded the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Rice and Grain: Rice is the main food in Guangdong Province. However, the rice produced in this province has always been insufficient. Even in years of good harvest, it can only supply nine months of demand. The grain for the remaining three months must be supplied by various places in Annam, Tokyo, Rangoon, and Siam. Therefore, the amount of foreign rice imported each year is extremely large. It is recorded that a total of 80 million dan of foreign rice was imported in 1928, with each dan calculated at eight yuan, totaling 640 million silver dollars. Although accurate statistics for 1929 are not yet available, due to the drought this year, both the early and late rice crops failed. It is expected that the amount of foreign rice imported will be even greater than in the previous year. Most foreign rice is based on gold. Those that previously used the silver standard, such as Annam, have now also switched to the gold system. As the price of gold has risen, the price of rice has followed. According to the ratio of gold to silver, gold has risen by about one-fourth. Let's assume that Guangdong pays 60 million silver dollars for foreign rice each year. Due to the high price of gold, an additional 150 million silver dollars must be paid each year. This huge amount of money directly affects everyone's daily life to a significant extent.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Flour: Although flour is secondary to rice, it is widely used, and its sales are also large. In recent years, domestic flour mills have flourished, recovering a lot of profits from abroad. However, considering the situation in detail, the average amount of wheat produced domestically (i.e., the raw material for making flour) is only enough for general flour mills for six months. The rest must be transported from countries such as the United States, France, and Canada for supply. After the price of gold rose, the value of raw materials soared, and the price of flour will also be greatly affected. Currently, because each factory has a lot of raw materials in stock, it will not be significantly affected for the time being. However, when the raw materials are used up in a month or two, and the domestic production cannot keep up, there may be a day of soaring prices during this interim period. With this obstacle, the flour-making industry will inevitably suffer a major blow.</p>
<p>Foreign Goods: The foreign goods business has become increasingly difficult due to various reasons and has had no good prospects for years. Last year was particularly bleak. After the price of gold rose, the prices of various foreign goods also rose, with an average estimate of about one-fourth. This unexpected change has shaken the foundation of foreign goods. Those with a large stock of old goods may be able to make a lot of money suddenly, but the future is difficult and just beginning. Its future is not optimistic. Currently, due to the high price of gold, most foreign goods firms dare not order from foreign countries. Even if they buy them, the prices are too high, and no one cares. It is heard that several large foreign goods firms in the city, known as "splitters," have recently gone bankrupt, which shows the great impact of the high price of gold.</p>
<p>Matches: The Guangdong match industry has been in decline due to the pressure of cheap competition from the Swedish match trust. Recently, with the support of officials and people, it has regrouped, hoping to fight the last battle with foreign goods. Unexpectedly, it suddenly encountered this unprecedented gold surge. All kinds of raw materials, such as medicinal materials, box slices, and match sticks, have increased in price, averaging about twice as much as before the gold price rose. The industry, affected by this blow, is almost desperate for the future.</p>
<p>Soap Industry: The Guangdong soap (i.e., soap) manufacturing industry can be said to have been at its peak in recent years. Taking Guangzhou as an example, there are more than 200 large and small soap factories. However, due to immature technology, incomplete equipment, and a lack of fundamental consolidation, it has gradually been overwhelmed by foreign goods and is showing a declining trend. Now, the prices of various raw materials, such as salt, spices, and fire wine, have soared along with the price of gold. In normal times, it can only barely support itself. Now, affected by this, it is difficult to compete with foreign goods. It is foreseen that the domestic sales market will soon be taken away by foreign goods again. Moreover, the important raw material of salt is entirely supplied by foreign countries. This alone is enough to be a fatal blow to the soap manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>Gold Industry: The Guangdong gold industry can be roughly divided into two categories: (1) Sanyi Tang gold shops, whose main business is the manufacture of gold jewelry and utensils, and also the melting and selling of gold leaf and gold bars; (2) Xinghe Tang gold and silver jewelry shops, whose main business is the manufacture of gold jewelry and utensils, and also the manufacture of patterned silver ornaments. After the price of gold soared, from more than 40 to 1 to more than 50 or 60 to 1, people generally saw this unprecedented high price and were deterred from buying gold jewelry. As a result, the business of gold shops plummeted, and the cold situation was unseen in the past ten years. As for the sales of gold leaf, due to the high price of gold, it has decreased by about 80% or more. Currently, gold shops have uniformly stopped opening furnaces to refine gold leaf because of the sluggish sales of gold leaf and the high price of gold coins, which is difficult to calculate. (Gold shops make gold leaf by melting and refining gold coins from various countries.) At the same time, due to the high price of gold, there are fewer buyers and more people carrying gold jewelry to melt and sell. Each gold shop is afraid of buying too much gold, and if the price of gold falls again in the future, it will suffer losses. Moreover, it is difficult to turn over capital because there are purchases but no sales. Therefore, many have temporarily stopped buying. As far as the current situation is concerned, the gold industry has already suffered huge losses, and it will be even more difficult to sustain if this continues.</p>
<p>Weaving: In recent years, although the Guangdong weaving industry has been under pressure from foreign goods, a part of it is still able to sustain itself, such as towels, socks, shirts, and local cloth. Due to low labor costs, the cost is relatively low, and the sales are still good. However, the raw materials used, except for a part of cotton yarn supplied by Shanghai local yarn, the rest of the cotton yarn, hemp yarn, and cold thread are all supplied by foreign countries. Taking Guangzhou as an example, cotton yarn worth more than one million yuan is transported from the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States each year. Including hemp yarn, thread yarn, and cold thread, it should reach several million. Now that the price of gold has risen, the price of yarn will follow. In the future, the weaving industry will be in trouble again. Moreover, the local yarn transported from Shanghai, because the raw materials used by each yarn mill to spin yarn also need to be supplied by Indian cotton, the current stock of cotton in each factory is only enough for a few months. In the future, when the stock is used up, it will have to be bought at a high price, so the cost will be high, and the price of yarn will inevitably rise. When the time comes, the local yarn will either stop spinning or increase the selling price. Although the weaving industry wants to use cheap local yarn, it cannot be obtained. Therefore, the future of the weaving industry is now quite bleak.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: The decline of the piece goods industry in recent years has been well known to society and does not need to be described. After the trend of high gold prices started, it gave the industry a major blow. Now, all the stores in the industry are unable to calculate due to the high price of gold. They are hesitant to place orders. Some only place a small number of orders to deal with retail sales. Some temporarily support the facade with old stock from previous years and no longer place new orders to wait and see the rise and fall of the price of gold. Some think that the difficulty of high gold prices is difficult to overcome and reduce the scope of business to avoid this trend. For a time, the entire industry showed a decline. However, the piece goods industry needs to order spring and summer goods in early spring and autumn and winter goods in summer. Now that most stores have not placed orders, even if there is a sales market in the future, there will be no goods to meet the market. Judging from the current situation, the piece goods industry is unlikely to improve in the near future.</p>
<p>The above is only about the larger industries that have been investigated. In addition, I don't know how many other industries are similarly affected. However, seeing the microcosm, it is enough to see a glimpse of the impact of high gold prices and low silver prices on various industries and people's livelihoods in Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Holds</h3>
<p>Registration of Unemployed Specialized Talents</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, Guangdong Province has been engaged in various new constructions, and there is a great need for talents. However, scholars with specialized knowledge often find themselves unemployed due to the lack of introductions. The authorities are aware of this situation and have specially organized the registration of unemployed specialized talents by the Guangzhou Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. On the one hand, government agencies can recruit talents to increase efficiency, and on the other hand, those who have talent but have no opportunity to use it can also be helped. The Social Affairs Bureau considers this move to be an urgent matter for solving social problems in recent times. Yesterday, it issued ten registration rules and started the registration process. The registration rules are as follows: (Article 1) The registration of unemployed specialized talents in various fields in this city shall be carried out in accordance with these rules. (Article 2) Applicants for registration must have one of the following qualifications: (1) Graduates of higher specialized schools or above at home and abroad. (2) Graduates of Category A vocational schools who have been engaged in social work for more than five years. (3) Those who have special expertise and have specialized writings or creative works that contribute to society. (Article 3) Those who have one of the following items are not allowed to register: (1) Those who have made statements or actions that violate our party. (2) Those who have been deprived of their civil rights and have not yet been restored. (3) Those who have bad habits, disabilities, tuberculosis, or mental illness. (Article 4) Applicants for registration should present their graduation certificate, appointment letter, employment certificate, or writings and creative works, and fill out three detailed resumes, each with a recent 4.5-inch half-length photo. The resume form will be determined separately. (Article 5) Applicants for registration should also submit any opinions, creative works, and writings on the improvement or development of agriculture, industry, or commerce for review. Those who need to be returned may declare in advance in the submission. (Article 6) Qualified registrants will be selected or introduced by the Bureau. (Article 8) Personnel who have been recruited and introduced must have a reliable guarantee from two staff members above the level of appointment in various agencies in the city, or teachers in secondary schools or above, or a guarantee from a wealthy store. (Article 9) If there are any unfulfilled matters in these rules, the director may submit them to the Municipal Government for modification or supplement. (Article 10) These rules shall be implemented from the date of approval by the Municipal Government. (February 18th)</p>
<h3>The Eastern Railway's Telegraph Rights Meeting Problem</h3>
<p>The Russian Side Suddenly Changes its Attitude</p>
<p>Opposing Our Establishment of Border Telegraph Offices</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence, February 17th: Li Diyan, Director of the Postal and Telegraph Department of the Communications Committee, returned to Harbin on the 12th of this month after seeking instructions from Liaoning. On the morning of the 16th, he met with Isuma Yiloff, the Russian Director-General of the Eastern Railway Council. Isuma said that the convening of the meeting was still not a problem and only depended on whether the Chinese side now allowed the return of the various reporting offices. If the Chinese side returned the reporting offices, he could order the railway bureau to send a committee to the meeting within a few hours. Isuma also said that he was ordered only to restore the original state in accordance with the Boli Conference records and knew nothing else. His attitude suddenly became stronger than before and was completely different from when he met for the first and second times. Li responded that the Communications Committee advocated that before the meeting was held, it was necessary to first decide whether the international telegrams were allowed to be inspected by China and to increase the amount of international telegraph fees. If these two points were agreed upon, then the assets of the telegraph offices would be handed over while the meeting was held. There was no need to hold the meeting before the issue of sovereignty was resolved. Isuma said that his responsibility was only to restore the original state, and other matters had to be submitted to the government for further discussion. Li also told him that China would set up a reporting office in Mansui to inspect international telegrams sent by the Eastern Railway telegraph office. Isuma said that this matter should be moved to the Sino-Russian conference table for discussion. Li said that the Sino-Russian conference discussed matters related to the interests of the two countries. The establishment of a telegraph office on the border to inspect telegrams was China's inherent right. For example, hiring guards to watch the door of a shop was a personal right and did not need to seek the consent of neighbors. Therefore, the Russian side had no need to object to this matter. Isuma was speechless but excused himself by saying that he had to ask the government for instructions. Therefore, there was no result from the contact that day, and the meeting originally scheduled for the 17th was suspended. Li Diyan is still waiting for a reply in Harbin on this matter and will contact him again after the Russian Director-General receives the reply telegram. As for international telegram fees, the Eastern Railway charges 2.1 kopecks per word. Our telegraph office charges 7.5 kopecks per word to Vladivostok and 9.5 kopecks per word to Moscow. In the future, our side will argue for an increase in international telegram fees, first to avoid affecting the income of our own telegraph office, and second to increase sovereignty fees. In short, the Russian side currently only seeks to receive first, and the rest of the verbal expressions of returning commercial telegrams and respecting Chinese sovereignty are all fraud. Whether the meeting can be held depends on the Russian government's reply.</p>

<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Another Jailbreak Occurs in Fengcheng. A jailbreak occurred in this county's prison earlier this month, and the case has not yet been closed. The second jailbreak case has come again. Last night (22nd) at about 3:00 AM, the prisoners in Cell No. 9 first filed off the iron shackles, then removed two wooden bars from the protective wall and tightly tied them with rope to form a ladder. They planned to escape from the prison gate by leaning against the wall of the roof. At that time, the chief of the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau was patrolling and heard the sound. He immediately rounded them up and reported to Warden Lu Wen. Lu woke up from his dream and immediately searched everywhere. As a result, only one prisoner, Wang Agen, escaped. The county government has reported the details to the High Court for investigation.</p>

<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>The Entanglements After the Closure of the Dazhang Clothing Store. The Dazhang Clothing Store on the Wharf Street of this county has been open since 1923, and it has been seven years. Due to years of losses, the turnover was not smooth, and it was closed on the 10th of this month. It owes about 7,000 yuan to Zhenyu and Tonghe. The savings depositors also have a number of 8,000 yuan. After the closure, the remaining goods are estimated to be 8,000 yuan. Chen Jinzhang, the manager of the store, took photos of the remaining goods and auctioned them off to compensate the store and the savings depositors equally. Unexpectedly, the store funds require the full repayment of the debt, and Chen Jinzhang, the manager of the store, did not agree, resulting in a failure to resolve the issue and causing entanglements. Both parties reported to the Chamber of Commerce to request mediation. It is heard that the remaining goods have been sealed by the Chamber of Commerce, and a meeting will be convened to discuss and resolve the issue.</p>
<p>A Love Story with Twisted Plots. A widow, Ms. XX, in a certain village in the western township of Qingpu, is 45 years old. Her husband has been dead for many years, and she has no children, so she adopted a daughter, Guiying, who is 29 years old and has a beautiful appearance. Ms. XX planned to recruit a son-in-law to spend the rest of her life. Her neighbor, Mr. Lu, is already in his twenties and has not yet married. Ms. XX saw that he was reliable and thought of marrying her daughter to him. When she asked Guiying, she also expressed sympathy. So, she ordered Lu to move to one place. Xie, who lives in the same village, was very angry to see Lu's success was about to be achieved, because Xie had already fallen in love with Guiying and had a secret agreement to make a lifelong commitment. So, he instigated Gao to seduce her to Ms. XX's house and used money to win Guiying's favor, and he succeeded in bewitching her. At the beginning of this month, he secretly took Guiying to Shanghai, stayed in a hotel, and made a good dream come true. Since Lu lost his wife, he was initially extremely angry and searched everywhere. Ms. Wang also went to Shanghai to wash her face. Unexpectedly, Lu and Ms. XX developed an ambiguity over time and put the past behind them. Xie and others learned of this situation and took Guiying back to their hometown the other day and cohabited. Ms. XX learned that her daughter was at Xie's place and went alone. Unexpectedly, Guiying suddenly escaped from the back door when she saw her mother coming. Ms. XX was extremely angry and invited Mr. Lu to go to Xie and others to demand her daughter. They disagreed and even used force. Ms. XX immediately reported to the village chief and requested assistance. I don't know how this matter will be resolved.</p>
<h3>松江</h3>
<p>Five-tenths mu donation approved for collection: This county, due to insufficient local budget for the 18th year of the Republic, local undertakings were affected. The county government and the finance bureau jointly submitted a request to collect five-tenths of a mu from the people's fields to make up for the shortfall. The finance bureau has now received instructions from the finance department approving the collection. However, since the busy canal transport of the 18th year has already commenced, there is no way to add the collection. Yesterday, representatives of local groups were specially convened to discuss solutions. The discussion resulted in an agreement to borrow, but there was no way to raise funds immediately. A separate collection could be made to ensure that the budget shortfall for the 18th year could be resolved.</p>
<p>County government burns confiscated opium: The county government has been handling opium prohibition cases.

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Wuxi to be designated a model industrial zone: Minister of Industry and Commerce of the National Government, Kong Xiangxi, and Minister of Health Liu Ruiheng, discussed choosing one of three locations, Shanghai, Qingdao, or Wuxi, to be a model industrial zone, in order to jointly establish the newest factory enterprises. After detailed investigation, it was found that most factories in Shanghai and Qingdao had foreign investment, while Wuxi's factories were purely established by Chinese merchants, making it most suitable for establishing a model industrial zone. Therefore, it has been decided that Wuxi will be the national model industrial zone. Once submitted to the National Government for approval, it will be implemented. It is also rumored that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will dispatch directors and staff to Wuxi in the coming days to conduct a detailed investigation and, together with the municipal preparatory office, invite people from all walks of life to a meeting to exchange ideas and discuss factory improvement plans. The municipal office has already notified the factories to jointly welcome them when the time comes.</p>
<p>Unexpected changes in the establishment of the county court: The issue of the location for the establishment of the county court in this city has been delayed for some time. It was not until the other day that the high court dispatched secretary Yao Guowei to Wuxi to survey the old City God Temple with county government judges Dong Banggan and Zhou Zidun as the site of the court. The repair costs will be funded by the city's bar association for 2,000 yuan, with the remainder to be raised by the county government. Judge Dong even took the sketches and the plan to convert the old City God Temple into a county court to the high court president, Lin, for instructions the other day. He returned to Wuxi that evening, and the situation suddenly changed. It is said that after President Lin carefully reviewed the sketches and plan, he expressed extreme opposition to converting the old City God Temple into a county court, stating that the old Wuxi government's houses had already been purchased with funds to serve as the county court site, which would be most appropriate. He advocated that the establishment of the court be put on hold and prepared for establishment in the second phase (after July of this year). He also insisted that the county court must be located in the old Wuxi government building. Furthermore, since the county court in Nantong County was almost ready, it was scheduled to be established on March 5th. Therefore, President Lin immediately appointed Dong to be the president of the Nantong County Court, urging him to take up his new position quickly. After Dong returned to Wuxi, he specially submitted a request to President Lin of the High Court to recommend Judge Zhou to go to Nantong to assist in everything, and went to荻 again last night to ask President Lin for instructions, so that he could come to Wuxi to handle the handover and go to Nantong to take over.</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Liang captures his enemy: Liang Dairong, battalion commander of the 1st battalion, 31st regiment, 17th brigade of the National Army stationed in Wuxi, was originally from Leiyang, Hunan. He previously studied infantry in the third class of the Whampoa Military Academy. One of his classmates, Liu Yide, was also from the same hometown as Liang, and was obsessed with communism. In the winter of the 16th year of the Republic, he implemented communist work in Hunan, organizing teams for murder, arson, and mountain search. Liang had some family property, and his parents were killed by Liu. At the time, Liang was stationed with the army on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. He learned of the destruction of his family and vowed to capture Liu at all costs. Recently, according to a confidential report, Liu was hiding in Suzhou. Liang received the report and went to Suzhou overnight. While trying to inquire and investigate, he unintentionally met Liu at the New Stage on the road outside the Lu Gate. He immediately ordered the soldiers of the machine gun company stationed in the hospital to arrest him and escort him to the regimental headquarters. Since the regimental commander, Xu Dunrong, had gone to Beijing and had not returned, he telegraphed the Leiyang County government and the anti-communist committee in advance to collect evidence of Liu Yide's wrongdoing in Hunan in order to send him to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Public Security Bureau sets deadline to ban gambling: The Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Zou, considered that gambling dens were rampant in Suzhou, with as many as 18 locations inside and outside the city.

<p>Negotiations underway in the case of Shi Shaobo's embezzlement and escape: Shi Shaobo, the manager of Hengda Cloth Store on Guanqian Street, embezzled more than 300,000 yuan and fled without a trace.

The store's shareholders have entrusted lawyer Zhu Run and others to establish a liquidation office to carry out liquidation. On the afternoon of the 23rd, shareholder representatives invited creditors to a meeting at the General Chamber of Commerce. More than 120 creditors attended. First, lawyer Zhu reported that the store's existing goods and property were valued at 177,909.49 yuan, and the total debt was 383,455 yuan. The inventory was only about 40% of the debt.

<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Minutes of the Lawyers' Meeting: After the establishment of the Wuyi County Court, lawyers could, as usual, appear in court to defend litigants. The lawyers had contacted President Wu Zengshan several times. President Wu stated that the preparations were not complete and that he needed to ask the High Court for instructions. Therefore, this issue had not been decided. On the 22nd, lawyers Zhuang Zengyi, Liu Wei, Chen Dayou, Chen Yuansu, Lu Xueer, Jiang Youhua, Yun Kuiyao, and others specially convened a meeting to discuss the following matters: (1) The Wuyi County Court is of a summary court nature. Cases of second instance must still be filed with the Wuxian Local Court. The lawyer appearing in court must be a member of the Wuxian Bar Association. However, according to Zhejiang's practice, members of a bar association within the jurisdiction of each district court can only be designated to appear in court in one county and perform their duties. County courts within the jurisdiction of the Wuxian District Court will be established soon. Should all members of the bar association be allowed to appear in court, or should they be limited to one county as in Zhejiang's practice? A public decision should be requested to make suggestions. The discussion resulted in the lawyers jointly sending a letter to the Wuxian Bar Association, which was forwarded to the High Court for review and instructions. (2) A lawyer's lounge is usually set up in the county court. The current one is not suitable for use. If it is necessary to construct one, the court is limited by funds. How should it proceed? A public decision should be requested. The discussion resulted in each lawyer raising funds to build it themselves, and it should be carried out on schedule. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3>Funing</h3>
<p>Villagers destroy the town office: Nearly 40 villages near Beisha in this county hold a dragon king festival at the Dragon King Temple every year on the 20th day of the first lunar month. The other day, the town chief, Meng Lizhai, and others hung the town office and volunteer soldiers' signs in front of the temple gate. Therefore, the ignorant villagers near Chuang considered that Meng was obstructing the festival and gathered more than a thousand villagers, both men and women, yesterday to destroy the town office signs. They went to the home of Town Chief Meng and destroyed his belongings. The district chief, Li Youhong, was immediately notified, who then reported it to the county government. The county government then ordered the deputy captain of the police team, Li Yuzhi, to lead a team to investigate. As the police team approached, Li Changmin rang the gong to gather the crowd. Deputy Captain Li arrested Li, and the rest scattered.</p>
<p>Escorting bandits encountered bandits who tried to recapture the prisoner: The second police station of the second branch of Tianshi Field captured a bandit, Yang Erjinlong (i.e., Yang Chaoguan), yesterday. This morning (19th), they were escorting him to the County Public Security Bureau. When they arrived at an empty area in Jiazhuang, many bandits suddenly came and opened fire to recapture the prisoner. Bandit Yang took the opportunity to escape. The local militia opened fire to help and shot Bandit Yang dead. The rest of the bandits scattered.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Dismissal of the battalion commander stationed in Baiguan for smuggling: Chen Wenshan, the battalion commander of the fifth battalion stationed in Baiguan for smuggling suppression, has been repeatedly accused by salt merchants and people to the Transportation Department of releasing smugglers and demanding excessive fees. After the Transportation Department forwarded the case to the Smuggling Suppression Bureau, it was confirmed that the allegations were true. Chen Wenshan has been dismissed. The vacancy will be filled by the promotion of Captain Cai of the fourth team stationed in the city. Cai went to Baiguan on the 20th to take over and assume his duties.</p>
<p>Wang and Hu mutually accuse each other, but the interrogation yields no results: The case of Wang Baochu, a farmer from Hutiantian, and Hu Bochuan, Chen Zhenhua, and Chen Lie mutually accusing each other was sent to the Ningbo Special Court for trial. It is now known that the Special Court ordered the county government to order the police to summon Hu Bochuan, Chen Zhenhua, Chen Lie, and related persons Chen Sijing and Shao Lianpo to a gathering for interrogation. Chen Sijing and Shao Lianpo argued to the Special Court that they had no relationship to the case. Hu Bochuan avoided appearing in court, Chen Zhenhua falsely reported that he was away on business, and Chen Lie falsely claimed to be ill and did not come. As a result, there were no results again.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Public Security Bureau continues to capture thieves: The Xiaoshan County Public Security Bureau previously captured two suspects, a man and a woman surnamed Zhong. After repeated interrogations by the Judicial Section, it was found that the male suspect, Zhong Luzhi, was indeed not involved and was released on bail. The female suspect, Zhong Li, was the wife of the thief Zhong Chengsheng and was temporarily detained. The police were ordered to strictly arrest the thief and bring him to justice. Detective Chen Xuezhou and others secretly went to Wanglutou Village, which is under the jurisdiction of the county, and captured the thief and brought him to the bureau. After a detailed interrogation by Section Chief Jiang and questioning his wife, Zhong Li, as a witness, he finally confessed everything and provided the names of many accomplices. Eyes were sent out again to arrest them.</p>
<p>Change of director of the Public Education Hall: Wu Xiangshan, director of the Xiaoshan Public Education Hall, has been on leave for a long time and has not returned. As a result, no one is responsible, and the affairs of the hall have been suspended. In view of this, the county government has specially appointed Wang Yuncong to take over. The director has now arrived at his post and is on duty.</p>
<p>Detained rice boat allowed to be released: The Yucang and other rice shops in Xiaocheng previously transported 82 dan of white rice to Gualin. It was spotted by patrol officers from the third sub-station of the Public Security Bureau, who were afraid that unscrupulous merchants would smuggle them out of the country, so the boat was detained. The Public Security Bureau immediately sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. On the 19th, they received an edict from the county magistrate stating that the rice was indeed being transported to Gualin and there was no suspicion of smuggling it out of the country. After receiving the edict, Director Gao released the boat.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>

<h3>The Department of Education of Zhejiang Province Appoints Three County Education Directors</h3>
<p>Zhu Shoupeng in Tiantai, Wang Zhenxiong in Xianju, Yan Zutai in Anji. The Department of Education of Zhejiang Province recently considered that Yuan Ding, the director of the Tiantai County Education Bureau, was incompetent and ordered his dismissal. The vacancy was filled by transferring Zhu Shoupeng, the director of the Xianju County Education Bureau, to fill the position. The vacancy in the Xianju County Education Bureau was filled by Wang Zhenxiong. Wang is a graduate of the former Beijing Higher Normal School and has served as the provincial inspector, the principal of the Tenth Normal School, and the Sixth Middle School, and has investigated education in Japan and Korea. Zhang Shuzhu, the director of the Anji County Education Bureau, was also ordered to be dismissed for neglecting his duties, and Yan Zutai was appointed to fill the position. Yan is a graduate of the former Zhejiang First Normal School and has served as the director of teaching at the attached primary school of the school and the principal of the Hangzhou County First Primary School and Sixth Primary School.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Will</h3>
<p>Hold Exams for County Education Directors</p>
<p>Chen Hexian, the director of the Department of Education of Jiangsu Province, submitted a proposal to the provincial government meeting on the 18th to hold examinations for the directors of education in the counties of Jiangsu Province, along with a draft of the regulations. The proposal has been approved. The proposal is as follows:</p>
<p>Proposal: It is hereby noted that since the implementation of the County Organization Law in Jiangsu Province, all county education directors should be selected and recommended by the county magistrates from among the qualified personnel who have passed the examinations. However, the examinations for county education directors in Jiangsu Province have not yet been held. Although there is an organization of a Screening Committee, the recommendations are only based on qualifications, and the screening may not be thorough. Whenever there is a vacancy, the selection of a replacement is often a matter of careful consideration. I believe that the examination system was personally established by Sun Yat-Sen, and there is no better method for selecting talent than this. Previously, the Department of Education received an instruction from the Provincial Government, which was forwarded by the Executive Yuan to approve the reply from the Examination Yuan that matters related to the examination of local administrative personnel should be temporarily handled by the Provincial Government itself before the Examination Law is officially implemented. According to the current situation in Jiangsu Province, it is necessary to hold examinations for county education directors in advance. I respectfully submit the Provisional Regulations for Examining County Education Directors in Jiangsu Province for discussion at the meeting. If appropriate, please decide.</p>

<p>Shanghai Basketball Game</p>
<p>Features Two Dramatic Battles</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association will hold two Group A games tonight: Tongji vs. Mailing and East-West vs. Holding Team. Both are evenly matched battles, and they also mark the end of the entire Group A schedule. Although the championship has been snatched away by the American Qiaos, the secondary rankings still require dramatic battles to determine, inevitably leading to fierce struggles. The game times for each group tonight are listed on the left:</p>

<p>Westerners Football Association Group A Games</p>
<h3>Lehua Disappointed in Championship</h3>
<p>Lost to Navy by One to Three</p>
<p>Weidexi Secured the Championship</p>
<p>Since participating in various competitions of the Westerners' Football Association this year, Lehua has won every battle and been invincible. For a time, the Shanghai teams watched with bated breath. The so-called Senior Cup, Group A Championship, and Scott Cup, the three major championships, almost seemed inevitable. However, after losing to Weidexi, the future of the Senior Cup was lost. Yesterday, after losing to the Navy again, the Group A championship was lost. Two of the three major championships are gone. The remaining hope lies in striving to win the only Scott Cup championship.</p>
<p>Weidexi Secured the Championship Lehua's loss to the Navy yesterday indirectly benefited Weidexi. According to Weidexi's experience against major enemies, the only remaining game is against Portugal. Portugal is at the bottom of the teams and is far from being a match for Weidexi. Its defeat is inevitable. Therefore, Weidexi will take the honor of the Group A championship and sail away smoothly. This is expected.</p>
<p>Reasons for Lehua's Failure It is easy to find a thousand soldiers, but difficult to find a general. The recent two failures of Lehua may not be due to the absence of Feng Yunyou. Feng is indeed a temporary choice among the internal guards in Shanghai. However, he unfortunately suffered an injury and is resting. Since then, the internal defense has lost its cornerstone, and its strength has been greatly reduced. The forward's enterprising spirit has been affected. If Feng were on the field, the future of the Senior Cup and the hope of the Group A championship would still be greatly assured. Feng's presence or absence has a huge impact on the team. However, apart from Li Huitang, Zhou Xianyan, and Sun Sijing, the others seem to have diminished compared to before. Is it a decline in skills or arrogance and complacency? The two failures are self-inflicted. Although a loss in the east is a gain in the west, it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. Lehua, work hard and advance bravely. You should know that today's failure is actually a good lesson and the foundation for future success.</p>
<p>Review of the Two Teams' Match Since referee McShell announced the start of the battle, the Navy fought bravely and performed wonderfully. At first, Lehua tried its skills three times but failed and retreated. After five minutes, the left winger Wang crossed the ball, and Chen Jiaqiu faced the empty goal. He lifted his foot to attack, but the force was weak and slow, and it was blocked by the defender. The three central generals attacked again, forcing a corner kick. Wang kicked the corner kick, and Sun Sijing suddenly kicked the ball high and over the goal. After that, the Navy's momentum greatly increased, and its activity was abnormal. However, in the crucial moments of shooting, there were many wastes. In the last five minutes, An Yuan's two mistakes caused a big mistake. He was scored by Ender from the Navy one goal after another. In the first half, the Navy took the lead with a score of two to zero. At the beginning of the second half, Lehua was full of energy and hoped to turn defeat into victory. However, the enemy's army was strong, and the ball's direction was always obtained by them, so they could not do whatever they wanted. There were occasional opportunities for reversal, but they were either too hasty or too slow. At any time and anywhere, they became fleeting, which was not Lehua's usual style. Fortunately, around the thirtieth minute, Chen Zhenhe bravely took the lead and joined the forward attack. Soon, he scored a goal for Lehua, avoiding the tragedy of the entire army being annihilated, and Lehua's morale was greatly boosted. At this time, if Lehua could step up its efforts, there might be hope for a turnaround. However, the Navy exerted even greater pressure than before. In the last three minutes, De Defei scored another goal, and Lehua lost with a score of one to three. Thousands of spectators in Shenyuan were all disappointed and returned.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, the Xibu team and the Shanghai team played a Group A game at the racecourse. As a result, Xibu defeated Shanghai with a score of three to two.</p>

<h3>(3) Competition Championship Methods</h3>
<p>Supplement to the Baseball Throwing Rules</p>
<p>Inspection of Self-Prepared Sports Products</p>
<p>Drafting Competition Venue Rules</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Preparatory Office for the National Games, various sections have been proceeding separately and have reached a considerable degree. The competition aspects have also been drafted early and sent to various provinces and cities for preparation. Now, in order to make it easier for Chinese people to understand, we have collected all the items that have been announced or are being drafted by the competition section and made a systematic summary, which is recorded below.</p>
<p>Types of Championships This year's conference is divided into 12 championships, with men and women listed separately and not mixed. There are eight for men: track and field, all-around, swimming, football, basketball, tennis, volleyball, and baseball. There are four for women: track and field, basketball, tennis, and volleyball. (The individual sports programs of track and field, all-around, and swimming are omitted)</p>
<p>Determination of Championships The methods for determining the championships in each category are as follows: (1) For track and field, all-around, and swimming, the championship will be awarded to the province, special city, or overseas Chinese group with the most total points. If two or more groups have the same total points, the championship will be awarded to the group with more first-place finishes in individual sports. If the number of first-place finishes is also the same, the championship will be determined by the number of second-place finishes, and so on. (2) Football will use the elimination method to determine the championship. If the two teams are tied at the end of the game time, it should be extended by 30 minutes first. If it is still a draw, the game must be rescheduled. (3) Basketball will use the elimination method to determine the championship. (4) Tennis will adopt the Davis Cup system, with four singles matches. Each participating group will use two players to compete alternately, and no replacements are allowed midway. There will be one doubles match, and the players do not have to be the singles players. Each group will determine the winner based on a best-of-five-sets system. The team that wins three out of five sets will win the group. The championship will be determined according to the elimination method. (5) Volleyball will use the elimination method to determine the championship. However, the preliminary and semi-final matches will be determined by a best-of-three-sets system, and the final will use a best-of-five-sets system to determine the championship. (6) Baseball will use the elimination method to determine the championship. It is stipulated that nine innings will be the end of the official game, but if the two teams are tied at the end of nine innings, it will be extended by two innings. If it is still a draw, the game must be rescheduled.</p>
<p>Production of the Overall Championship The province, special city, or overseas Chinese group with the most championships will win the overall championship of the conference, one for men and one for women, and will not be combined. If two or more groups have the same number of championships, the number of second-place (i.e., second) finishes will be used as the standard for determination, and so on. If the ball game competition must determine the runner-up due to the overall championship issue, the relevant championship committee may order the team that lost to the championship team in the semi-finals and the loser in the finals to have an extra game. The winner will be the runner-up, and the third place and below will be deduced accordingly. (If it is not related to the overall championship, the runner-up will not be determined again)</p>
<p>Baseball Throwing Rules There is a baseball throwing event in the women's track and field program, and its rules have not been announced. They are now supplemented as follows: (1) The ball used in the competition shall be a standard indoor baseball with a circumference of 12 inches. (2) When throwing the baseball, the thrower must use only one hand from behind the shoulder and throw forward behind the throwing line (the action is the same as serving a baseball outdoors. The throwing line is the inner edge of a wooden board buried flat in the ground. The width of the wooden board must be at least 7 Sheng's meters (464/3 inches) long, 3.66 meters (12 feet) (3) A foul throw, as specified below, does not need to be measured and should be counted as one failed attempt: 1. Violation of Section 2. 2. When throwing, any part of the trunk or the clothes worn touches the throwing line or the ground outside the line before the ball lands. (4) Each competitor will be given three throws, and the six with the best results will be given three more throws, but the longest of the throws will be used as the competition score for each individual. (5) Draw a fault line one meter away from the throwing line. Stepping out or running past this line without throwing will be counted as one fault. Two faults will be counted as one throw. Listen if you do not run but throw the ball while standing still. (6) The distance of the baseball throw shall be measured at right angles from the nearest point where the ball lands to the throwing line or its extended line.</p>
<p>Regulations for Sports Products (1) Regarding track and field, each team can prepare its own sports products, such as javelins, discus, shot put, baseball, etc., but they must be submitted to the competition section for inspection before the opening of the conference. If they are deemed to comply with the rules and stamped with a fire seal, they can be used during the competition. (2) Regarding ball games, the balls used in the competition will be provided by the conference. However, except for the finals and the last semi-final, the competition section may allocate and use old balls in the preliminary rounds to avoid waste. Other sports products such as bats, gloves, rackets, etc. shall be prepared by each team.</p>
<p>Drafting of Competition Venue Rules It is expected that the sports and ball teams participating in this conference will be very enthusiastic. In order to maintain order at the venue and ensure the smooth progress, there must be careful rules to comply with in order to achieve perfection. Therefore, the competition section is currently drafting the venue rules for various sports, which will be implemented after being approved by the legal committee in the future.</p>

<p>Full Route Stations: Branch stations and offices will be set up along the entire Shanghai-Hankou route. One will be at the capital (Nanjing), and another at Jiujiang. Anqing was initially planned as a branch station, but due to the scarcity of passengers, it was decided to abandon the plan. The station chiefs for the Hankou and Jiujiang stations have already been appointed. Zeng Hongtu will be the station chief in Hankou, with Lin Zixin as the administrator and Xu Keping as the clerk. Jiujiang station will have one station chief. The personnel are scheduled to take a boat to Jiujiang and Hankou today to prepare everything.</p>
<p>Following Land Routes for Flights: In order to achieve speed, the Administration has decided to fly directly via land routes. The aircraft used will also be land-based. The journey from Shanghai to Hankou will take approximately six and a half hours. The one-way ticket price is set at within one hundred yuan to promote civil aviation.</p>
<p>Purchasing New Aircraft: The Administration currently has six aircraft of various sizes. It has now placed additional orders with the American Stinson Aircraft Company for two new aircraft of each size.

The equipment is quite complete, and they are expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of March or early April.</p>
<p>Expanding Offices: The Administration's office in Shanghai and the Shanghai Aviation Station are moving to a new address at 1233 Lafayette Road because the office address is too small for work. A short-wave radio will also be set up to communicate weather conditions in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hankou to ensure flight safety.

<h3>Chen Dezheng's</h3>
<p>Correction of Yan Xishan's Telegram</p>
<p>At the Sixth Memorial Week held by the Municipal Education Bureau, Bureau Chief Chen Dezheng made an important speech regarding the absurdity of correcting Yan Xishan's telegram. The text is as follows:</p>
<p>Taking this opportunity, I will give a brief report on the current situation in the past few days. As everyone knows, Yan Xishan, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army, Navy, and Air Force, sent a telegram on the 10th, which roughly stated that the country has been experiencing internal warfare for years, and all parties have felt deeply pained. Therefore, he advocated for the elimination of internal warfare and that the opposition should be responsible for national affairs, etc. Thus, Yan Xishan wanted to buy a boat ticket and invited Chairman Chiang to buy a boat ticket as well. Regarding this point, those with sharp minds have already sensed the storm is coming. Those with slower minds may think it is like advocating benevolence. We do not have time to investigate what intentions Yan Xishan's telegram had, nor have we carefully considered its impact. However, from the Party's standpoint, Yan Xishan's telegram is indeed very inappropriate. I will state the reasons for its inappropriateness as follows: First, party members must recognize their responsibilities. It is not easy to become a party member. Once you become a party member, all your words, thoughts, and actions should be subject to the Party's control and obey the Party's command. There is no freedom for personal words, thoughts, and actions. Because all party members, before obtaining party membership, were given ample freedom to consider the Party's ideology for a long time. Once they became party members, it was clear that they had dedicated themselves to the Party and no longer belonged to private individuals. Of course, they should only obey the Party's resolutions and follow the Party's orders. Therefore, Yan Xishan's words in the telegram were far from the Party's discipline. To be honest, the entire Party entrusted a great responsibility to Yan Xishan. If he is a comrade of our Party, he should take the Party's intentions as his own. If he considers himself a follower of the Premier, he should恪恪follow the Premier's teachings. However, Yan Xishan still values personal freedom very highly and Party discipline very lightly, and wants the revolutionary leader Chiang Kai-shek to go abroad with him. This is not only a joke, but also a clear violation of Party discipline. Second, party members must understand the Party's organization. Yan Xishan advocated for uniting the three sessions of the executive and supervisory committees and wildly issued the slogan ("Party matters should be handled by party members, national affairs should be handled by nationals.") It is evident that he is extremely ignorant of the matter and is truly violating the spirit of party governance. To speak plainly, Wang Jingwei previously united the Guangxi faction and the Western Hills Conference faction in Nanjing to organize a special central committee, hoping to usurp the Party's power and deceive the public, but in the end, because it lacked a foundation, it was scorned by the people of the entire country and disappeared in an instant. Past history has already told us this very clearly. Therefore, we know that anyone who despises the Party's system and history will surely fail. If we can gather the members of the first, second, and third executive and supervisory committees to discuss and resolve Party matters, then we can also invite the former Emperor Xuantong and the fugitive Wu Peifu and Zhang Zongchang and the hiding Duan Qirui to jointly discuss and resolve national affairs. This is nothing but ignorance of the Party's organization and obliteration of the Party's history. Third, speaking of national politics, this is a time when everything needs to be rebuilt, and all reactionary forces are waiting to be suppressed. At this time, what China relies on to maintain itself is the central government's composure and the head of state's strategic planning. If the central hub has even the slightest change, and the head of state has even the slightest negative thought, the nation's survival will suffer a great blow. In fact, we deeply understand the current critical situation in China, where domestic and foreign troubles are pressing upon us. Apart from Chairman Chiang, who can shoulder such a heavy responsibility of worry and hardship? However, Yan Xishan wants to advocate for courtesy and responsibility in the opposition. I really do not know what his intentions are. Therefore, from the standpoint of the nation and the people, we can see the fallacy of Yan Xishan's advocacy and that he should be severely punished by the Party. Fourth, Yan Xishan is the highest official and has been entrusted by the country. Furthermore, he took the oath of office as Deputy Commander-in-Chief in front of the Premier's portrait on January 22. Who would have expected that his intentions would suddenly change after only 19 days, saying things like "courtesy and responsibility in the opposition." If Mr. Yan truly wants to be responsible in the opposition, then why did he take the oath 19 days ago, undertaking such a great responsibility in the government? Since he has already taken the oath and taken office, he should make twelve-fold efforts to repay the Party and the country's trust. We know that all officials, from the head of state to the clerks of the county government, only have to obey once they have been entrusted by the national government. There is no second word to say. How can it be that even the ordinary obligation of obedience is not known before the oath has dried, and the reason for abandoning it is known? Fifth, Yan Xishan wants to talk about courtesy, but he does not want to sing alone. He insists on dragging others along, an action that is close to coercion and duress. Comparing it directly to ancient history, it is equivalent to Cao Cao forcing the palace. Is this kind of reactionary behavior something that someone with a major national mission should do? Everyone knows that Yan Xishan believes in the teachings of Confucius. Let's talk about it in terms of the way of Confucius. Confucius's lifelong teachings are nothing more than the two words "loyalty" and "forgiveness." Loyalty means loyalty to the nation, and forgiveness means "do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." If Yan Xishan's subordinates, Shang Zhen and Sun Chu, had sent a telegram a year and a half earlier saying that we wanted to be courteous and let Mr. Yan Xishan step down and take responsibility, I think Mr. Yan would definitely be furious. He is doing something to his superior that he does not want his subordinates to do, violating the national discipline. How can Mr. Yan explain himself? In short, an official with great responsibility is acting in this way towards the head of state, directly disregarding the national discipline, destroying the Party's discipline, being ignorant of his own obligations, and failing in his own duties. From this, we can see that there is nothing right about Yan's telegram.</p>
<p>I have said that the foundation of lasting peace is built on a unified country. If unification is not the basis for peace, then this peace is false. If peace is used as a slogan, but it contains other intentions, it is not only false peace but simply a criminal of peace. The so-called unification is built on the basis of unity of purpose from top to bottom across the country. Otherwise, if you want to be opportunistic, I want to avoid it, you want to plunder, I want to take advantage of it, how can we maintain true peace? Moreover, the current peace truly requires everyone to risk their lives to obtain it. If we advocate courtesy, the country's chaos will definitely be realized immediately. To be honest, even if the saying of courtesy passes, it can only be applied in times of peace. How can we sing this kind of tune in the current period of suppressing bandits and fighting chaos?</p>
<p>When the country is in trouble, the people should stand up and speak. When officials lose their temper, the people should also stand up and speak. Now that Yan Xishan has lost his temper in this way, the entire citizenry should not remain silent and say nothing. We who have the responsibility of educating the people should pay full attention and make full efforts to this matter.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Returns to Beijing</h3>
<p>Li Jinlun Accompanies Him</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, accompanied by the newly appointed Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Li Jinlun, took the night train to Beijing at 11 o'clock last night. Norway's new envoy to China, Obel, also entered Beijing on the same train last night and will present his credentials this morning. The Railways Bureau will prepare a flower car to transport him.</p>
<h3>Record of Contemporary Figures' Movements</h3>
<p>Sun Ke, Wei Daoming, and He Yaozu all went to Beijing together on the express train last night.</p>
<h3>Measuring the Depth of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>Previously, the Shanghai Dredging Bureau wanted to know the depth of the waterline in the Yangtze River area. They commissioned Zhang Chenghui, a hydraulic engineer, and appointed Jin Shizhong of the surveying department as the director. They led a surveying team and brought all the necessary surveying equipment, boarded the Bureau's own surveying boat, and sailed up the Yangtze River to conduct on-site measurements along the way. The Jianghai Customs Surveying Team also participated in the joint survey. Since departing in January, they have surveyed as far as the Kuangling Shoal in Sichuan. Unexpectedly, the spring water has risen greatly at the shoal recently, making it difficult to carry out surveying work. The Bureau recently received a telegram from Director Jin from Sichuan, stating that the spring water is rising greatly, making it difficult to work, and requesting instructions on what to do. Engineer Zhang of the Bureau replied by telegram, instructing him to quickly predict the survey, fearing that the river water would become even greater and hinder the work.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bond Fund Allocated Today</h3>
<p>Fifth Allocation of 30,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau will transfer the municipal bond fund of 30,000 yuan to the Municipal Bond Fund Management Committee today (the 24th). This is the fifth allocation.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Petitions for Prompt Formulation of</h3>
<p>Unemployed Workers Insurance Measures</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan Orders the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to Review and Plan</p>
<p>Relief Measures</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau believes that due to the economic depression of industry and commerce in the city in recent years, many factories and businesses have closed down due to losses, resulting in an increasing number of unemployed workers. These people's livelihoods have suddenly become difficult. If relief is not sought urgently, they will suffer from hunger and cold and resort to dangerous actions, causing concern about social security. The best plan for now is to quickly carry out public works to accommodate unemployed workers, as stipulated by the Central Executive Committee, and to establish unemployment insurance measures to remedy the situation. However, carrying out public works requires funds everywhere, which the current municipal treasury may not be able to afford. Considering the pain of unemployed workers, it cannot be delayed. Therefore, the Municipal Government is requested to promptly plan relief measures or immediately forward the report to the central government to allocate funds so that they can be held early to benefit the labor movement and ensure security. It is especially hoped that the central government will refer to the precedents of eastern and western countries, promptly formulate, promulgate and implement unemployment insurance measures, in order to eliminate unemployment panic in case of emergencies. The Bureau will also submit a list of labor-management disputes mediated by the Bureau from August of the 17th year to January 20th of this year, belonging to closures, shutdowns, and reduction of business scope, for review and approval. After receiving the report, the Municipal Government found that the phenomenon of worker unemployment in the city is becoming increasingly serious, and appropriate arrangements should be made. In addition to instructing the Bureau to first carefully discuss concrete plans for public works that should be carried out, it will immediately submit the list of labor-management disputes to the Executive Yuan for inspection and verification, and request the Legislative Yuan to promptly formulate and promulgate unemployment insurance measures for compliance. After receiving the report, the Executive Yuan found that the relief of worker unemployment and worker insurance matters are within the scope of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The original report and attachments are issued and ordered to be reviewed and replied to by the Ministry. The Municipal Government is also instructed to be informed.</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition of Rice Export and Hoarding</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received an order from the Department of Civil Affairs, stating that after finding that unscrupulous merchants were privately transporting rice out of the country and hoarding for speculation, six punitive measures were established and circulated for compliance. However, rice prices have recently been rising, and it is becoming difficult for the people to afford food. The reasons may be due to the disastrous autumn harvest last year, but unscrupulous merchants may also be privately transporting rice out of the country, hoarding for speculation, and all kinds of inappropriate consumption, which have affected the people's food supply. With the approval of the National Government, strict prohibitions are reiterated in order to stabilize rice prices. The order instructs strict compliance by the County Public Security Bureau and all districts to safeguard the people's food supply.</p>
<h3>Methods for Additional Levies on Universal Education Acreage Donations</h3>
<p>Must Be Within 1% of Land Value</p>
<p>No Levies in Areas Where the Stipulated Range Has Been Reached</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau received instructions yesterday from the Jiangsu Education Department, stating that as the counties were notified of the case, the provincial government committee previously stipulated that for counties that had established People's Education acreage donations, each acre should be levied starting at eight fen and gradually increasing to one jiao six fen, stipulated that counties cannot exceed more than 1% of their taxes, and that the people's Education acreage donation must also follow the 1% restriction. Therefore, the province approved to transfer to the provincial finance departments counties who requested increases to the acreage donation. It was reported, however, that the Finance Department had already overstepped the stipulated 1% limit, so, they could not be increased, or the county reports regarding taxes and land prices could be assessed. This year, temporarily follow the tax rate of the year prior. Consequently, the planned budgets for increasing the yearly promotion of projects for counties came to a halt. The beginning of the era of political tutelage is drawing near, and the conduct of People's Education is extremely important. Since we must promote projects, we should increase funds. In regions that do not exceed the limits to which an acreage donation has already been levied, one must not ask for another acreage donation. If the budget is not exceeded, and a request for approval for People's Education donations in excess of the 1% limit is submitted to the Ministry, a prompt decision is to be made to approve the request. It was subsequently ordered by Instruction number 700 to listen. The case had been discussed by committee members the 26th time, and had been primarily approved, and distributed to the Treasury. Let it be known.</p>
<h3>Borrowed Jinpu Line Cars Have Been Allocated as Requested</h3>
<p>The Jinpu Railway had requested the Ministry of Railways to transfer cars from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to maintain freight transport, as there was a shortage of vehicles for freight transport, and the Ministry of Railways approved the request and ordered the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to transfer the vehicles. It has been reported in this newspaper that the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureau ordered the Vehicle Department to find a way to allocate vehicles. The Vehicle Section telegraphed all stations yesterday to quickly empty all freight cars for collection and delivery. Therefore, the Shanghai South Station first ordered the allocation of 12 boxcars, followed by 25 cars from the Zhabei Mechanical Affairs Office, and 13 cars from the Rihui Port Maigen Road, for a total of 50 cars.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Cars were gathered and shipped out of Maigen Road on two empty special trains at 1:00 p.m. yesterday to Nanjing Jiangbian Station for unloading before crossing the river for application to the Jinpu Railway.</p>
<p>Some Family Members of the May 30th Massacre</p>
<p>Have Not Received Compensation</p>
<p>Hu Changsheng and Chen Fucai, representatives of the family members of the May 30th Massacre martyrs, signed with the British工部局 on December 26th of last year (lunar calendar) to receive 150,000 yuan in compensation and distributed the funds independently, giving each deceased family member 2,000 yuan and each injured comrade 500 yuan. The two representatives each received 5,000 yuan themselves, which caused dissatisfaction among some family members. The compensation received by the two representatives exceeded the compensation for the deceased martyrs by 3,000 yuan, which was suspected of being manipulated and controlled. Unexpectedly, after the two representatives distributed the compensation, they avoided meeting people, causing family members in other provinces to come to Shanghai to collect compensation from the family members' association. However, they did not know where the family members' association was located and could not find out. They contacted the board of directors of the May 30th Cemetery, but the two representatives, Hu Changsheng and Chen Fucai, had to be present to prove it. However, they could not find out where the two representatives lived, causing the family members who came to Shanghai from other provinces to be at a loss in the hotel. They were also running out of money and were worried that something dangerous would happen if they were delayed for too long. The family members who had already received compensation and the injured comrades did not know how much money the two representatives, Hu and Chen, had distributed, and they did not publish it in the newspaper, so they were completely in the dark. Therefore, they decided to organize another family members' association and revoke the representative status of the two representatives, Hu and Chen. They also hired a lawyer to check the amount of compensation issued and how much was left and where it was stored. The family members also did not know where the secretary, Pan Qianchu, lived and could not contact him.</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Suzhou Silk and Satin Industry on its Perilous Situation</h3>
<p>The Suzhou Silk and Satin Industry Cloud Brocade Guild, having previously received inquiries from the Shanghai Special Municipality Social Affairs Bureau regarding the decline of business, has specially prepared a summary report and respectfully submits it for review. The original text states: "Having received inquiries from your esteemed Bureau regarding the state of decline of our industry, we are deeply grateful for your concern for practical industries. Suzhou silk and satin formerly sold both domestically and abroad, enjoying a reputation for excellence. Since the Xinhai Revolution, we have continuously improved weaving techniques and sought innovation daily. However, business has shrunk instead, and ceasing operations and seeking alternative employment is unavoidable. Looking at the most recent causes: (1) The surge of labor unrest. In the years of the 16th and 17th years of the Republic (1927-1928), labor unrest arose one after another. In the early days of the establishment of labor unions, unreasonable demands and disputes were at their worst, business was suspended, and losses were already huge. Moreover, forced to pay back wages, going back to the past, amounted to over 100,000 [currency units], leaving the industry exhausted; this is one cause. (2) The increase in wages. In the past two years, there have been repeated demands for wage increases, comparing to the original amount, adding up to more than 30%. The cost is heavy; this is the second cause. (3) The overlapping of taxes. Silk threads have taxes, finished goods have taxes, transportation has taxes, and there are many items for postal transportation taxes, such as transit duties, 2.5% tax, and various surcharges. It is still impossible for one tax to pass through smoothly. Furthermore, all goods and account books must have stamps affixed. Moreover, the artificial silk used in woven goods is taxed at 4 yuan per case, which increased to 16 yuan per case. The cost is increasingly heavy, and it is impossible to fully add it to the price of the goods. According to various Western countries, raw materials for the silk industry are mostly tax-exempt, and domestic operating taxes are also very low. Our country is the opposite; the burden is heavy; this is the third cause. (4) The rejection of foreign sales. Suzhou satin used to be mostly exported to Korea. Since the 13th year of the Republic (1924), Japanese imports have suddenly increased heavily in tax, imposing a 100% duty on fresh silk and satin. The sales of these goods have been cut off from that time onwards. Currently, goods to Vietnam have also been obstructed due to the French tax increase last year. Foreign sales are rejected; this is the fourth cause. (5) The invasion of foreign silk. Silk products shipped to China from various Western countries are constantly innovating, relying on low taxes in their own countries and the lenient customs duties in our country, competing for profits and sales without restrictions. The Chinese people look like wild ducks, fond of showing off novelty. Furthermore, Western suits have been popular one after another. In recent years, the Zhongshan suit has been vigorously promoted, and all materials abandon domestic goods. Moreover, imported products are cheap, and the middle and lower classes disregard domestically produced cloth. Therefore, the sales of Suzhou satin are not only damaged abroad but also abandoned domestically; this is the fifth cause. (6) The impact of disasters. Since the war in the year of Jiazi (1924) spread, business goods have been stagnant. Suzhou satin used to be widely sold in Sichuan, Shaanxi, Guandong, and Zhili provinces. In recent years, the three northeastern provinces, Henan, Shaanxi, and Sichuan, have been plagued by either bandits or frequent disasters. The Longhai and Pingpu railways are often blocked. Outside of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the path to operation is becoming increasingly narrow; this is the sixth cause. The above sections are all recent causes of the decline of the Suzhou satin industry. Currently, it is difficult to hope for a temporary recovery of foreign sales. Foreign silk cannot be driven out domestically. Surrounded by difficulties, there is no prospect for improvement. What merchants hope for is that reducing inland taxes separately, and truly reducing likin, is not enough to save costs. Simplifying postal taxes, one tax for all, is not enough to benefit operations. Imposing heavy taxes on imported foreign silk, according to the foreign method of rejecting Chinese goods, is not enough to help sales. Although the clothing regulations were issued last year, using domestic silk and satin as raw materials, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang silk industries jointly organized relief and conducted grand publicity, but no significant effect was seen. Clothing materials have extremely broad uses. Why abandon the silk of our ancestral homeland and use imported goods? It is heartbreaking. If the government officials promote Chinese-style robes and mandarin jackets, court dress, and not wear Western suits, the upper class will influence the lower class, which will be enough to reverse the trend. In this era of high prices, using one more unit of domestic silk means suffering one less unit of loss, allowing industrial and commercial livelihoods to be maintained without depletion. The guild is the Suzhou satin sales agency in Shanghai, entrusted by domestic manufacturers to promote various satin fabrics, but has no success. First, outside the national border, we cannot take a step beyond the boundary. Second, the northwestern provinces cannot be boldly operated. Third, the local market in this city is flooded with foreign silk, making it difficult to reverse customs. Lowering prices is not enough to cover costs. If this is not rescued for a long time, industrial and commercial livelihoods will inevitably fall into desperation, workers will lose their jobs, and they will take risks, which is particularly dangerous for social security. What we hope is that your esteemed Bureau will greatly assist in overcoming the difficulties of the times and find ways to maintain [the industry]. Shanghai is the center of commerce. If it is possible to lighten its burden and remove its oppression, then the Suzhou satin industry may have a glimmer of hope and maintain its inherent position. Respectfully requesting your consideration is greatly convenient. Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai Special Municipality Social Affairs Bureau, Cloud Brocade Silk and Satin Guild."</p>
<h3>Intercepting Smuggled Salt Vessels Entering the Country</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs has recently received reports from various counties in the province that a group of people resembling refugees are driving smuggled salt vessels to townships, forming groups, opening scales, and soliciting business. Township chiefs advise them to stop, but they do not listen and linger. This situation not only hinders salt taxes but also concerns local security. Therefore, a notice has been issued to all counties to strictly intercept entry, etc. The Shanghai County Public Security Bureau received instructions from the county government. Yesterday, Director Shen forwarded instructions to various branch bureaus that if the aforementioned smuggled salt vessels are encountered, they should be intercepted immediately to prevent them from entering the country.</p>

<h3>The Fifth Standing Committee Meeting of the Jiangsu Rice Association</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Ning-Hu City and County Rice Industry Association held a spring banquet at the Cuixiu Hall on Fuyou Road yesterday and held its fifth joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members. The committee members present were Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoquan, Ye Huijun, Cai Yukun, Chen Junyu, Zhao Zixin, Huang Qixiang, Ren Zhishan, and representatives Qiang Zisheng, Zhang Jingzhai, Zhu Zhaoji, Li Zhongchen, Shen Shaoqin, Lu Zhuqing, Yin Fengqi, Zhu Yinzheng, Mi Ganqing, Lu Gongquan, Fu Qiangeng, etc., totaling 19 people. After the banquet, the meeting was convened. Ye Huijun was publicly elected as chairman. After the ceremony, the chairman reported on the visit to Nanjing, stating that he went to Nanjing on the fifth of last month to meet with Commander-in-Chief Chiang, stated that the rice tax was harassing merchants and harming the people, that the government's income was limited, while the Likin officers were filling their own pockets endlessly. There were also bad practices such as photo tickets. In the past, each ship was extorted two dimes, but now it has increased to four yuan. Merchants were afraid of their power and paid painfully, and there were already complaints. If the Commander-in-Chief could resolutely abolish the rice donation, not only would rice merchants and people sing praises, but the government had an order to cancel the Likin on October 1. The rice donation is related to the people's food, and it should be implemented early. Commander-in-Chief Chiang agreed to handle it in advance. Zhao Zixin proposed that colleagues in various counties be prohibited from trading directly with cargo customers in other counties. It was resolved to notify the rice industry associations in various ports to strictly prohibit this. Chen Junyu proposed that rice prices have recently risen, and the people are experiencing difficulties in their livelihoods. The provincial government and the Department of Civil Affairs should be ordered to purchase foreign rice to enrich the people's food, and that the existing righteous granary reserves should be sold at fair prices. It was resolved to immediately petition the provincial government and the Department of Civil Affairs to order implementation. Lu Gongquan proposed that the rice sold in Shanghai is milled too well, losing the scientific nutrients. The body color should be regulated to enrich the people's food. It was resolved that the Shanghai Food Commission had already proposed this for discussion, ordering each factory to comply. This association need not discuss it again. Due to the poor harvest everywhere in the past year, rice prices have increased sharply. At the time of the grain shortage, there is fear of a rice panic. This association should jointly purchase a large quantity of foreign rice with rice merchants from various counties to prevent future uncertainties. It was resolved that the situation of this case is similar to that of Committee Member Junyu's proposal and can be handled together. Zhu Zixiang reported that the association's remaining funds are all stored in the Jiading Bank, and proposed to rectify the collection of membership fees to maintain permanence. It was resolved that those who have not paid in various places will be sent a letter to urge payment again, and that those who have paid in various places will work hard to maintain the situation. The meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Along the Two Railways</h3>
<p>Strengthening Bridge Security Day and Night</p>
<p>Kong Fanjun, the police chief of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, issued a notice yesterday to all section police chiefs, stating: "The Management Bureau's Order No. 187 states: "The Songhu Garrison Headquarters' Order No. 223 states: Commander-in-Chief Chiang telegraphed: 'Due to the current unstable situation, bandits and potential insurgents are lurking. The railway line along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway should be placed under martial law immediately to prevent unexpected events. All bridges along the railway line should be guarded by troops day and night to secure the rear and maintain transportation.' You are to follow the instructions and strictly order your subordinates to patrol closely." You are instructed to follow these instructions and strictly order your subordinates to deploy defenses and patrol closely day and night without negligence."</p>
<h3>Police Chief of the Two Railways</h3>
<p>Order to Rectify Police Affairs</p>
<p>The police station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway South Station Shanghai Segment, due to the fact that the eighteen police officers on duty had too many working hours, and four police officers from the reserve squad had to be transferred to the office after work, the police officers opposed Section Chief Huang Renjie. The police officers went to the North Station Police Station to request a reduction in work. Subsequently, Police Chief Kong transferred the eighteen police officers back to the North Station for other uses and ordered eighteen members of the security team to be transferred to the South Station to supplement the duty police officers. Now, Police Chief Kong Fanjun of the two railways issued a notice to the police stations of each segment yesterday, stating: "Railway police are one of the special types of police in the country. Since they are given police powers, obedience is their duty. There are regulations for service, uniforms, rewards and punishments for merit and demerit, and compensation for death. All of this is to show that they are state public servants. However, recently, segment chiefs have often said that since the railway is a business, the railway police are just manpower. Most of the police officers have been trained in rotation, and they have already heard about the various points of the railway police's knowledge. How can they still say such irresponsible words when they are police officers? Words are the voice of the heart, and the heart is the master of the body. If the words are contrary, the behavior can be known. If we do not explain in detail and correct strictly, what can we expect of the future of the police force? From the time of this notice, the section police chiefs must still explain the points of the railway police's knowledge to their superiors from time to time. If there are those who disregard the law, act one way and think another, or engage in private connections, or intentionally resist superiors, once verified, they should be dismissed and prosecuted, regardless of their position, in order to uphold police discipline and assist in rectification. The official duty of the superior officials is also responsible. The order is issued, and the law will follow without leniency. Instruct and respectfully abide by it, and do not violate it, carefully, this order."</p>
<h3>Today is Estonia's National Day</h3>
<p>Our Country is Concluding a Treaty of Friendship and Commerce with Estonia</p>
<p>Estonia is a newly established country on the Baltic coast after the European War. Today is the 12th anniversary of its founding. However, it has no treaty relations with our country. The High Commissioner to France is currently negotiating a treaty of friendship and commerce with the Estonian Ambassador to France, Mr. Pusta, in Paris. Therefore, the country does not have any diplomatic officials such as ambassadors and consuls stationed in our country. Only an informal representative, Mr. Lumo, is stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Foreign Affairs Section to Move Back to the Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>The Foreign Affairs Section Passport Office of the Shanghai Special Municipality Public Security Bureau remained in the old site of the Diplomatic Office after the abolition of the Diplomatic Office in order to facilitate the registration and issuance of licenses for Chinese and foreign people. Recently, the director of the Foreign Affairs Section, Zhang Xinglian, resigned, and Director Yuan temporarily appointed Huang Guangdou, the chief of the Second Section. However, Chief Huang is very busy with official duties, and coming and going is inconvenient. Therefore, it is planned to move the Passport Office back to the Public Security Bureau. Houses are being built and repaired in the bureau. Once the renovation is completed, a notice of relocation will be issued.</p>

<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Steamer Steward Union: The Shanghai-Ningbo Steamer Steward Union issued a declaration yesterday regarding the comprador of the Xin Jiangtian steamer extorting meal allowances, stating that the stewards of the Shanghai-Ningbo line steamers do not have deserved wages. Following a bad custom, the comprador extracts the stewards' liquor fees (note: the steward must give the comprador one to five jiao for each customer served) to subsidize the comprador. Since the establishment of this union, it has been recognized that this kind of evil system is actually sucking the marrow and exploiting the blood and sweat of the workers. Under the bright sunlight, it is impossible to allow it to exist anymore. Therefore, after several severe protests and continuous struggles, this policy of extortion has been fundamentally broken. At the same time, the Ministry of Communications issued an explicit ban, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company headquarters issued a notice prohibiting it. Three years have passed since then. However, recently, Xu Yankang, the business director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xin Jiangtian steamer, and his partner comprador Wang Yanging, were blinded by greed, only trying to enrich their personal pockets, disregarding the suffering of the workers, disregarding the orders of the Ministry of Communications, treating the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's notice as a mere formality, daring to create bad rules, reopen evil practices, cleverly establish meal allowance names, and repeatedly use intimidating methods to force workers to pay. The workers all felt that life was painful and unable to bear the burden, so they unanimously denied it. The reopening of this example has a great impact on the workers of other ships, so they unanimously adopted a resolute attitude and a spirit of struggle to fight against evil forces, and the union submitted a request to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau for impartial assistance. After investigation by the Party and government organs, it was also recognized that the comprador cleverly established names to exploit the workers, which was difficult to establish. Unexpectedly, the capital side did not listen to the government orders, disregarded illegal dereliction of duty, and still used various illegal means to urge the workers, claiming that if they did not admit it again, they would immediately use force to dismiss the workers, etc. Such erratic behavior is not only destroying the labor movement and oppressing the workers, but also is similar to local bullies, and the crime is difficult to condone. Under this bad environment, all the union workers vowed to uphold the spirit of the Prime Minister's great fearlessness and persevere in the struggle, not only for their own interests, but also for the national navigation industry. I hope that all levels of labor unions and the national navigation industry will give sympathy and assistance. This declaration is for your public knowledge. In addition, the union once telegraphed the Ministry of Communications for strict sanctions on this case. Yesterday, the union received a letter from the Ministry of Communications No. 213, which stated: (Received, it has been ordered to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company headquarters to investigate and handle the situation. This is the letter.)</p>

<h3>Local News Two</h3>
<p>After the Great Fog in Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday's Weather was Sultry</p>
<p>The climate was warm, like late spring.</p>
<p>Fog Blocks All Ships Now Open to Shanghai</p>
<p>The winter climate was extremely cold, the most in recent years. The ice and snow covered the sky, and I didn’t know when spring would come. Since the beginning of spring, the weather has changed, with rain and fog alternating. The severe winter weather has suddenly changed. However, the fog was particularly heavy the past two days. Outside Wusongkou, there were even shipwrecks. Even vehicles traveling on the roads of this port were cautious due to the heavy fog, and the speed was not too high. As for yesterday’s temperature, it was also rare in recent years. At noon, it rose to as high as 78 degrees. Those wearing heavy fur coats were sweating profusely, and even those wearing cotton clothes felt unusually sultry, like the weather in May. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Fishing Boat Sunk by Ningxing Steamer: The day before yesterday, there was heavy fog at Wusongkou, which did not dissipate until dawn yesterday morning. The Ningbo fishing boat Jintang’an fully loaded with grain and goods from Shanghai, sailed to Song the day before yesterday at about 5:00 AM. After customs clearance at Wusong Rongtai Tax Office, it was preparing to set sail for export. Unexpectedly, the fog began to spread at about 8:00 AM. The boat was very afraid of the danger of sailing, so it dropped anchor and berthed near the Pudong San Chatu Port to wait for the fog to dissipate. Unexpectedly, at about 2:00 AM yesterday morning, the Ningxing steamer of the Ning Shao Company sailed in from outside Sanjia Water. Because the boat was blocked by fog at the berth, it was not seen by the Ningxing, causing the head of the boat to be broken by the Ningxing. The entire boat was filled with seawater. Seeing that the situation was not good, the boat immediately sailed to the shoal, but soon sank. There were six crew members on the boat who fell into the water. At that time, it was late at night and in heavy fog, and nearby boats did not dare to rescue them. Fortunately, the patrol boat of the Wusong Lifeboat Bureau was patrolling back and forth in the river. Hearing the crew members shouting for help, it immediately took risks and sailed to the scene of the accident, rescuing the crew members one by one. After the fog dissipated yesterday morning, the Jintang’an crew members took a small boat to inspect the wrecked boat at the scene of the accident. After the tide receded, it was floating on the surface of the water, and the goods in the boat had been lost, resulting in considerable losses. It has been reported to Zhang Huabang River Department, and negotiations have been made with the Ningxing Wheel. Also, at 11 o'clock the night before, a vegetable boat was hit and collapsed on a stone dam due to loss of road, fortunately no one was injured.</p>
<p>Fog Blocks All Merchant Ships Arriving in Shanghai: The fog that occurred in this port on the 21st and 22nd blocked the ships in Jianghai outside Wusongkou. Some were blocked for more than 20 hours. Until yesterday morning, after the fog receded, the merchant ships successively opened to Shanghai. From 6:30 AM to 3:00 PM, 42 merchant ships opened to Wusongkou in these few hours, including ten ships from the Yangtze River to Shanghai, eighteen ships from the north and south seas and coastal ports to Shanghai, and fourteen ships from Japan and foreign countries to Shanghai. The export ships that were blocked outside Wusong also exported at 8:00 AM yesterday morning.</p>
<p>The Fog is Very Heavy, Unseen for Many Years: The fog was heavier yesterday morning. It was difficult to distinguish within 20 to 30 steps on the roads. The weather was very hot and stuffy. From 6:00 AM to 12:00 PM, it rained and cleared several times. Although it was sunny in the afternoon, the weather was like the climate in the third month of spring, hot and stuffy. Shanghai Thames News reported that at about 7:00 PM on Saturday night, this port encountered a very heavy fog, which had not been seen for many years. However, the fog in Wusong was even heavier, and it was almost impossible to distinguish between them. The fog locked the river after 4:00 PM, resulting in the strange incident of a sand boat hitting a steamship. It is said that after 4:00 PM that day, a sand boat loaded with silk and groceries was imported, and suddenly collided with another sand boat, and then hit a small steamer, which was hit into a hole. Fortunately, it did not sink, and there were no drownings. Two boatmen on the sand boat were extremely frightened and jumped into the river. Later, one person was rescued by a passing boat, and one person drowned. By the evening, the body had not been found. The sand boat was of course also seriously injured, causing water to enter the head cabin, and many goods were soaked in water. The small wheel had been pierced, so it sent a signal for help, and then a tugboat was sent from Shanghai to tow it to a safe place.</p>
<p>Unfilial Student For</p>
<h3>Copyright Dispute</h3>
<p>Reading Half-Night Flying Head Reporter</p>
<p>Everyone Wants to Read Shuang Chu Ji</p>
<p>Someone Actually Ghosts Writes it</p>
<p>Demands Damages of 20,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Unfilial Student (pseudonym of Xiang Kairan) wrote Half-Night Flying Head Notes, sold it to Shihuan Bookstore for publication, and was well received by readers. Because there is a sentence at the end of the book that if you want to know the ending of the characters in the book, read Shuang Chu Ji, a boat of novel fans all want to see Shuang Chu Ji first. At this time, Unfilial Student's Shuang Chu Ji has not yet been finished, and it has stopped sadly. The book seller is of course not satisfied. So Chen Yimei of the bookstore changed his appointment to Sishui Yuyin to follow the name of Shuang Chu Ji, and wrote six volumes, which inevitably suffered from the ridicule of continuing the sable. However, Unfilial Student believed that the bookstore infringed on his copyright, and specially hired a lawyer to file a claim for damages against Chen Yimei in the Provisional Court, demanding damages of 20,000 yuan. One afternoon yesterday, Judge Ye opened a court hearing. According to the witness on the defendant's side, because the plaintiff wanted to increase the manuscript fee to 3.5 yuan per thousand words, the defendant changed his appointment to Sishui Yuyin to continue writing, and at that time, he had obtained the plaintiff's permission to follow the old name, but he instructed the writer not to start writing rashly, so as not to damage Yi Wen's name. The advertisement published when the book was published did not have the words "written by Unfilial Student", etc. The reason held by the plaintiff is that after the book was written, he planned to publish it himself. Now, the defendant has sold it under a false name first, causing losses. Later, because the evidence of both parties was not complete, Judge Ye granted an extension, and the two parties were ordered to submit evidence and continue the trial.</p>

<p>Since the opening of the "Unafraid of Death" film, which humiliated our Chinese nation, in the Da Guangming and Guanglu theaters, it has aroused great resentment among our Chinese people. Dramatist Hong Shen, because he was excited by righteousness, gave a speech in Da Guangming, and the incident of going to the police station has also been briefly recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, Hong Jun specially presented the plot in the film and the experience of being insulted, together with the five measures proposed to ban it, to the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Executive Committee for adoption and implementation. According to this matter, the Municipal Executive Committee and the Shanghai Special City Film Censorship Committee have discussed measures to ban it. The department is particularly angry about this matter, so after receiving the report, it forwarded it to the Central Propaganda Department to forward it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for serious negotiations, and sent a special letter to the Municipal Government for consideration and handling. The text of Hong Jun's report to the Municipal Party Department is recorded below:</p>
<p>Reporting that unscrupulous merchants are shameless and only seek profit, opening films that insult our Chinese nation, requesting a stop, Hong Shen went to the Da Guangming Cinema to watch the American-made film starring Locke at the invitation of friends this afternoon, Saturday (translated as "Unafraid of Death"), unexpectedly, after the opening, the film described the Chinese as thieves, the Chinese as kidnapping, all kinds of vulgar, barbaric and inferior, who are insulting and vilifying our nation, do everything possible, and especially selling opium is the main point in the plot, everything that Locke ("Unafraid of Death") inflicts on the Chinese ("Afraid of Death") that causes Westerners to laugh, it is like a knife to Shen Guan's heart, and then suddenly realized that Locke's choice of drug trafficking as the background is also speculation, because the Gao Yintuo case was once sensational in the United States, and newspapers in various places used very large characters to publish it. Most Americans have this incident in mind and perform it in the film, which is not only pleasing to the ear but also credible. Thinking deeply about this, I couldn't bear to see it, so I left my seat and walked blankly on the road. Because it was cold, I went home and changed out of my suit, but the insult given by the film was too deep, and I didn't want to endure it willingly, so I went back to the entrance of Da Guangming again, wanting to find a friend who went to watch it together to inquire about the whole film. At the entrance, I met several young people discussing this film, and they were about to write a letter to the newspaper to announce to the people of the country not to watch it again. One of them also showed a letter signed by 36 people in the Enlightenment Column of the Republic of China Daily on that day. Shen was greatly moved at this time, so he said that this kind of method is far away and cannot put out the fire nearby. Why not tell the audience immediately at this moment? Shen then stood up and reported to the audience the points in the film that insulted the Chinese, and asked everyone not to watch it again. Hundreds of people in the crowd expressed sympathy for Shen and left their seats one after another, and invited Shen to negotiate with the ticket office to return the tickets. At this time, Gao Jingming, the major shareholder and manager of the hospital, a Chaozhou native, actually instructed the Western manager he hired to drag Shen into the manager's room, wanting to imprison him, and started to beat him, breaking Shen's lips, taking away Shen's呢 hat and scarf, and directing the waiters in the hospital and the Indian and Western arresters to surround Shen. The Western manager also said to the English arrester in English, (I want to arrest this person), and then two or three Western arresters dragged Shen into the hospital, all the way to the Avenyi Road police station. After arriving at the police station, the Western arrester said that this person was arrested by the manager of the Da Guangming Hospital. Shen then explained the situation and argued with the police station, counting that Shen went to the police station from 5:35 to 8:20, about three hours before and after, that is, without the plaintiff coming to be responsible for the guarantee, and without a formal crime, he was detained for several hours until the theater people dispersed before releasing Shen. The Gao also can be said to be good at using the power of Westerners. I think that everyone has a heart, and being insulted is bound to be sad and angry, and being oppressed is bound to resist. The principle is the same all over the world. The authorities of the Concession rely on the taxes paid by our Chinese people to survive, but why do the British not satisfied with the writing of Chinese people being superior to the British in "Remnants of Flowers and Tears", then prohibit it, and why do the Italian soldiers not satisfied with the writing of Italian women's prostitution in "Street People", and after confiscating and burning the film, they conciliatoryly mediate, and for films that insult the Chinese people, such as "Unafraid of Death", they never ban it, and allow it to be opened, and Shen has been in the United States for six years, has worked in the shops run by the Chinese, and has also lived in the so-called Chinatown, only knowing that the overseas Chinese are working hard and surviving under heavy pressure, and never forgetting the glory of my nation, and never like the ugliness described in the "Unafraid of Death" film, even if there are one or two bad elements, just like the American prosecutor Husa, who was stationed in Shanghai and received tens of thousands of yuan in bribes and was imprisoned two years ago, this is a special situation and not a universal situation. Some Chinese people have not been to the United States and mistakenly believe that the film shown in "Unafraid of Death" is based on facts, but there are also many children of overseas Chinese in the Jinan Fudan University where Shen teaches, why don't the Chinese people go and meet them and ask them, are their fathers and brothers all like those described in the film? The fact is definitely not like this. In short, this film is full of meanness in joking, and in addition to insulting, it also makes false accusations, and its drawbacks are unimaginable. The result of its opening in the United States is just after the Gao Yintuo case, which can make the American people believe that the overseas Chinese in America are doing such things as murder, kidnapping, and drug trafficking, what is its impact on my international status, and what is its impact on the future of my nation, think about it, think about it, and I can't help but shudder. I remember when Shen was in the United States in 1926, black people in South America, because there were insults to black people in the film "Seeing the Light Again", seized the film and burned it when it was opened in a theater in Chicago. The director Gray Fuster added another thousand feet to the film, specializing in writing about the university run by black people and the various progress and excellent qualities of black people as an apology. Both are oppressed nations, is my old China really not as good as the black people in America? I will give a few suggestions on the relief methods within the scope of my knowledge, and I hope that you will examine and consider them for implementation: (1) Forward to the superior party department to transfer to the National Government Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the US government as soon as possible and prohibit the opening of this film in the US and any other country in the world, (2) Immediately burn the ("Unafraid of Death") film that has been transported to China in public, and it will not be allowed to be opened at any time or place in the future, (3) Severely punish the two film theaters that rely on the power of the Concession and are actually Chinese capital, namely (1) Guanglu, which profited from the film, and (2) Da Guangming, which lied to the audience that the film had been inspected by the municipal government and oppressed the Chinese people by borrowing the power of others, and ordered the two hospitals to donate the tens of thousands of gold they have earned in recent days to public welfare charities, (4) Severely punish Guan Jiong, the Chinese member of the film review committee set up by the Concession, for betraying the country and pleasing foreigners and passing this kind of film that insults the Chinese people, (5) Foreign films opened in the Concession in the future must also be subject to municipal government inspection and shall not enjoy ("extraterritoriality"), As for the damage suffered by individuals, I have entrusted a lawyer to formally file a lawsuit, and I hereby state that I respectfully present it to the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special City Party Department.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hankow Patrol Vessel Returns to Song after剿匪 Operation</h3>
<p>Fierce Battle with Bandits in Shengshan Harbor</p>
<p>Three Bandits Executed on the Spot</p>
<p>Zhu Bingzheng, the fourth district chief of the Wusong Water Police, dispatched guerrilla captain Wang Qingfu, who led a team aboard the Shanghai-Hankow patrol vessel to rescue the Haiying escort ship outside the Songkou estuary in the East China Sea. They encountered bandit ships robbing fishing boats in the waters off Shengshan and engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits. This was reported in previous newspapers. The vessel returned to Wusong yesterday. The reporter met with the fleet captain, Wang Qingfu, at around 4 p.m. and inquired about the 剿匪 operation in the open sea. Captain Wang replied that he led the vessel away from Song on the 16th to patrol the sea areas of Huaniaoshan and Sijiaoshan, but found no trace of bandits, nor did they know the whereabouts of the Haiying. When they patrolled to the waters of Shengshan Harbor, they saw more than ten bandit ships attempting to seize the fishing boats moored there. He immediately ordered the soldiers to open fire on the bandits, which lasted for four hours. Seven or eight bandit ships were hit by our artillery shells. One sank at that time, and countless bandits were killed. The bandit ships, unable to withstand the attack, scattered and fled. The robbed fishing boats were able to escape. They then captured the bandit leader Li Jinbiao, as well as bandits Bai Qi, and Wang Xing San. According to their confessions, there were more than three hundred bandits led by Li Jinbiao, who planned to separately plunder the residents of Sijiao and seize the wireless radio station of Shengshan. On the 20th, our vessel sailed into the inner harbor of Shengshan and docked there. Merchants and residents were overjoyed to learn that the bandit leader had been captured and requested that the three bandits be executed on the spot. Therefore, on the morning of that day, the three bandits, including Li, were executed by firing squad in Shengshan as a warning to the public. The audience was shoulder-to-shoulder along the roads. In this operation, our vessel's personnel were very brave and engaged in fierce battles. At the time, squad leader Luo Jianxiong and gunner Ning Hongwen were seriously wounded by bullets. On the 21st, they sailed to the waters of Sijiao again and patrolled for a week, but there was no trace of bandits. Therefore, on the morning of the 22nd, they sailed back to Wusong to replenish ammunition, coal, and other supplies, before proceeding to patrol the Tongchonghaiqi area.</p>
<h3>Chinese Merchant Tobacco Company Debt</h3>
<p>337,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Court Orders Repayment</p>
<p>Provisional Attachment Denied</p>
<p>The Chinese Merchant Tobacco Co., Ltd. is facing declining business and heavy debts. Most of its assets have already been mortgaged, and it still owes 337,000 yuan to 42 精版 printing companies. The creditor engaged Lawyer Ye Fokan to sue the Provisional Court, requesting a judgment ordering repayment and applying for provisional attachment of its assets. According to the creditors' investigation, the assets of the Chinese Merchant Tobacco Co., Ltd. were mortgaged separately to 工商 Bank, 泰利 洋行, 英昌隆 Money Exchange, and other institutions, totaling tens of thousands of yuan. Since the reorganization of the company, the losses have become even greater since the reorganization committee took over. Therefore, it has re-mortgaged the previously mortgaged properties to obtain funds for daily expenses. Seeing this situation, the creditors were deeply afraid that if this continued without intervention, the company's assets would inevitably be completely lost. Therefore, they cited the Civil Procedure Law and applied for provisional attachment, so that after the final judgment, there would be no difficulties in execution. The assets requested for provisional attachment include the entire business goods, buildings, and land of the company's main factory at 69 Huade Road, as well as all business property and real estate of the Kunming Road warehouse, as well as all trademarks, cigarettes, etc. of the company. The court, based on the petition, immediately summoned the defendant for a hearing by Judge Qu. The defendant fully admitted to the debt amount claimed. Therefore, on the afternoon of the previous day, Judge Qu pronounced a judgment ordering the defendant to repay the plaintiff 337,000 yuan and bear the litigation costs. However, the creditors' request for provisional attachment was rejected.</p>
<h3>Zhou's Maid Seeking Son Case Undergoes Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Zhou Zishan had a son with his family's kitchen maid, Tang Nianxi, years ago. The maid was, with the suggestion of Zhou's wife, Mei, sold to a certain person from Hubei, who took her to Hubei. After several years, the person from Hubei went away without a trace, and Tang Nianxi returned to Shanghai, citing the legal clause that the mother-son relationship cannot be severed, and engaged a lawyer to sue the Zhou couple, demanding the return of her biological son. The Provisional Court summoned them for a hearing and ordered reconciliation. This has been reported in the newspapers. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the case was continued by Judge Li Mo. The defendants Zhou Zishan and his wife still did not appear in court. However, Lawyer Zhan Jifeng came to court to testify about the factual process because he had previously represented Tang Nianxi in obtaining one thousand yuan from Zhou. He also submitted the power of attorney signed by Tang at the time and the manuscript of the receipt for one thousand yuan for inspection. Judge Li believed that protracted litigation would be of no benefit and ordered the lawyers of both parties to mediate with their clients and persuade them to compromise with each other to achieve a peaceful resolution, adjourning the case for seven days. If reconciliation could not be reached, they would be summoned again. The plaintiffs, upon hearing the order, withdrew.</p>
<h3>Woman Sues for Divorce from Husband</h3>
<p>Reconciliation Fails in Court</p>
<p>Ji Wangshi, a local woman living in the Shanghai Junying area, only gave birth to a posthumous daughter named Baozhen, who is now thirty years old. When she was thirteen years old, Ji Wangshi recruited Jiang Shunlin to her home as a son-in-law because she lacked children. When Baozhen was seventeen years old, Ji Wangshi married her off to Jiang Shunlin. They now have three children, the eldest daughter being twelve years old, the second son being eight years old, and the youngest child being five years old. Last year, Ji Wangshi and her son-in-law Jiang Shunlin had conflicts due to disagreements. The woman then asked the local court to terminate her relationship with her son-in-law Jiang Shunlin. A court hearing was held, and the termination was granted. After Jiang left Ji's house, he opened a Xinshunchang electrical materials store next to the apprenticeship institute on the railway station road, neglecting his legal wife Ji Baozhen. Now Baozhen has discovered that her husband is having an affair with a woman named Su Liumei and living together in the store, acting as if she is the mistress of the shop. Therefore, she is unwilling and has engaged lawyer Chen Wenxiang to file a divorce suit with the local court. Jiang Shunlin also engaged lawyer Wang Huanggong to file a defense, demanding cohabitation. Yesterday, Judge Zhao summoned a group of witnesses for a hearing. First, the plaintiff Ji Baozhen stated the previous situation and requested permission for a divorce. Witnesses Chen Changwen and Qian Qigen testified that they are friends with Jiang Shunlin. Last year, Jiang Shunlin asked us to invite Ji Baozhen to live in the store, but Baozhen refused, etc. The plaintiff weakly said, "If my husband breaks up with his lover Su Liumei and comes home to live with me, it doesn't matter if we don't divorce." Questioning Jiang Shunlin, he said, "I am now opening a store outside and cannot go back." The official asked why Su Liumei did not come today. He replied, "Good (referring to Su Liumei) has already run away." The judge then asked the plaintiff, "Are you still following your husband to live in the store?" The plaintiff replied, "He has a mistress and is living in the store. How can I live in peace? Because my mother has no son, I recruited a son-in-law to our home. Now, my husband should come home to live with me." Thus, reconciliation failed. Then, Prosecutor Li was invited to the court to begin a debate. At this point in the interrogation, the plaintiff's daughter Jiang Yueying testified, "I stayed in the Xinshunchang store for a few nights, sleeping in the same bed as my father and Su Liumei. I slept at my father's feet," etc. Prosecutor Li rose and gave his opinion. The judge then announced the end of the debate and scheduled the judgment to be pronounced at 1 p.m. on the 26th, and then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Disturbance over Ticket Refunds at Shanghai Grand Theater</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Grand Theater, located at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road in the Chinese area, screened the American Fox Company's sound film ("Secrets of the Cave") yesterday. Because it was a Sunday, there were many viewers. For the 5:30 p.m. show, the upper and lower levels were full before the screening time. Unfortunately, the equipment was damaged, so the screening could not begin at the scheduled time. Thereupon, the audience clamored and left their seats to demand ticket refunds. At that time, five or six hundred people requested ticket refunds at the box office, causing great chaos. Many people had lost their ticket stubs but still wanted to demand a refund of the ticket price. Yue Zhushan, a Shandong guard at the theater, was suddenly assaulted in the face by two Russian brothers, Bao克斯透, amidst the chaos. The police of the first precinct of the fifth district public security bureau arrested the perpetrators and brought them to justice.</p>
<h3>Runaway Wife Found in Thatched Cottage</h3>
<p>Jiang Hezhen, a 33-year-old man from Taixing, lives on Jiaxing Road in the British Concession and works as a rickshaw puller. His wife, Xu, is 27 years old and has some beauty. The couple's relationship has always been bad. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the ninth day of the abolished lunar month at 7 a.m., Xu ran away while Jiang was out pulling a rickshaw. Jiang returned home at that time and found that the place was empty. He cried loudly on the ground. Due to economic constraints, he was unable to post a notice to find her, so he asked his colleagues to pay attention and investigate. Yesterday, Jiang's friend Chen Xintang learned that Xu was hiding in a thatched cottage in Lujia Ferry, Pudong, and had met a dock worker named Li Guangdao. Jiang immediately crossed the river to Pudong with Chen at 4 p.m., found Xu at the address, and took her to the third district public security bureau for questioning.

After being questioned by Director Ni, he confessed that Han had often come to his house recently and had secret conversations with his wife, and their relationship was very close. He also had an affair with Shao Wangshi, who lives at No. 250, Yixing Lane, Xinjiang Road. Shao also often came to his house. Today, his wife suddenly disappeared. It must have been Han and Shao who conspired to abduct her. He requested an investigation so that his wife could return and reunite with him. When questioned, Han Wanfeng confessed that he had visited Yin's house and talked, but he did not dare to conspire to abduct her. The police were then dispatched to arrest Shao Wangshi from the district for questioning, but she also flatly denied it. Director Ni, believing that the matter involved abduction of a woman and a wife, and that the truth should be thoroughly investigated, ordered that they be sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>

<p>Yu Youren and Shanghai Gentry Publicly Mourn Mingjue Dharma Master</p>
<p>The temples of Mount Putuo are solemnly constructed, surpassing those of the entire country, and the incense offerings are abundant. The abbot of Puji Temple, the Venerable Mingjue, whose secular surname was Xiang, came from a prominent family in Luoyang. He was naturally compassionate, and his footprints can be found in famous mountains and ancient temples throughout the land. He had extensive social circles, with many well-known scholars and gentry among his acquaintances. In 1920, he settled in Mount Putuo and became a disciple of Venerable Yuyu, shaving his head and donning the robe. Subsequently, he served as the head of Xilin Hall. His independent fundraising and construction efforts were too numerous to list, such as the creation of Ruyi Lodge, the reconstruction of Duangu Street, and the construction of the Transformation Pagoda, all of which were long admired. In the spring of 1929, he was publicly elected by the monks of the mountain as the abbot of Puji Temple. Although the Chan Master served as abbot, he still spared no effort, running around raising funds, which led to accumulated fatigue and illness, and he ultimately passed away peacefully on January 10th. All the monks of the mountain and his relatives are deeply saddened. Shanghai gentry held a public memorial service yesterday at the branch temple of Baoben Temple. Guests included party and state leaders Yu Youren and his wife, Shanghai gentry Wang Yiting, Yu Qiaqing, Guan Jiong, Huang Qinglan, Lu Gongwang, and more than fifty others. From the monastic community were representatives from the Hangzhou Buddhist Association, Ciyun, the Shanghai Buddhist Association, Venerable Kecheng, the Putuo Mountain Buddhist Association, Dharma Master Huagao, the abbots of the various temples of Mount Putuo, Venerable Dixian, Dharma Master Zhide, and more than ten abbots, as well as forty or so lay Buddhists and disciples. Mingjue Master's secular sons, Xiang Guoqing and Guochen, both came from Luoyang with their families to Shanghai to attend the funeral. The abbot of Baoben Temple, Dharma Master Yingzhao, was in charge of the reception. The plain carriages and white horses created a grand scene.</p>

<p>A Respectful Warning to the Far East Opium Investigation Commission</p>
<p>Luo Yunyan</p>
<p>The so-called commission to investigate the situation of opium prohibition in the Far East was proposed by Sir John Eldon Sutton, the British representative, who stated at the time, "The commission will travel to China because the opium problem in China is recognized by the powers as the most difficult." From this, the intention of this proposal is clearly known. Moreover, the British Colonial Secretary stated the following to the British Parliament: "The British representative explained to the Prohibition Advisory Commission of the League of Nations that the opium disaster in Hong Kong is due to the continuous influx of opium from China." Therefore, last year, the British government specifically proposed to the League of Nations to send a commission to investigate the opium situation in the Far East, which the League of Nations immediately agreed to. Judging from the above, we can understand that this so-called commission is nothing more than a means for Britain and other powers with colonies in the Far East to prove that the time for prohibiting the opium disaster in the Far East is not yet ripe, and to blame China and Chinese emigrants for the immaturity. In other words, they want to extend the period for opium sales and use the commission's investigation to shift the blame to China. Therefore, we not only do not agree to the arrival of the commission, but also feel compelled to offer our humble opinion and list the reasons for opposition as follows:</p>
<p>The powers with colonies in the Far East should not use excuses and sophistry to extend the opium deadline and seek a monopoly on opium sales. If the various governments are determined to prohibit opium, a complete prohibition is not difficult. The success of the United States in prohibiting opium in the Philippines is a clear example. If the Philippines can do it, why can't India, Burma, Annam, Macau, Taiwan, and the Dutch Islands prohibit it? The powers do not strive for strict internal prohibition but merely offer empty words and blame foreign transportation to extend their opium monopoly. This is the first reason we oppose.</p>
<p>The Chinese delegation resolutely withdrew from the Geneva Conference in 1925 to oppose this commission to investigate opium prohibition. Our attitude remains unchanged to this day. China is an independent country, and foreign interference in all internal affairs is not allowed. When the League of Nations proposed the commission, not only China but also representatives from other countries believed that the commission's involvement in China's internal affairs was unacceptable. The organization of this commission had already aroused our protests. Now that the commission has come to our country again, we will naturally continue to uphold our previous position. This is the second reason we oppose.</p>
<p>Today's harm is not just opium but various drugs are even more harmful. Therefore, the commission's investigation should not be limited to opium but should also include morphine, heroin, cocaine, and other drugs. Most of these drugs are imported from foreign countries, as evidenced by the large quantities of drugs confiscated by post offices and customs every year. According to reliable investigations, the harm of opium has gradually decreased recently, while the harm of drugs has deepened. This situation is the same in provinces with strict opium prohibition, such as Manchuria, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Anhui, Hubei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi. These drugs are all imported from foreign countries, and the exporting countries still sign the Hague Convention and the Geneva Treaty. Smuggling of opium should be thoroughly investigated, but should the smuggling of drugs be allowed to run rampant and be ignored? Therefore, the commission's mission is entirely incomplete. This is the third reason we oppose.</p>
<p>Now, the Far East Opium Investigation Commission has come to the Far East under the orders of the League of Nations and will soon visit our country and meet with us. We express our respect and friendship to the individuals on the commission, but at the same time, we must make a request, that when the commission reports to the League of Nations, it should propose that the opium monopolies of the various Eastern colonies should be immediately stopped, as this policy is the most urgent step in the opium prohibition plan. Mrs. Lee has said, "What the West sees as poison is the same in the East. Poison is poison, regardless of East or West." Congressman Purdon has said, "There is only one standard of morality in the world, the same for both East and West. What should be prohibited or punished in the West should not be tolerated in the East." How insightful are these words! We dare to offer these words to the members of the commission, knowing that what we value is not whether the opium and drug monopolies are a major source of revenue for the colonies, but whether it is a genuine humanitarian endeavor, or whether it is obstructed by schemes and sophistry. May the members of the commission consider these words carefully.</p>
<p>Public Notice - Land Bureau</p>
<p>Instructions</p>
<p>Zhu Gongli submits a case requesting a replacement land license. The petition and attachments have been reviewed. It is stated that the petitioner's father purchased a total of five mu, three li, and four hao of land in the name of Wang Guihua, household number 91, 92, 93, and 94 of the 12th map of Nanshiwei in the 27th Bao. Two mu have already been deducted, and three mu, three li, and four hao remain. Because the original land certificate was lost at the time of purchase, a replacement document was issued, requesting verification and replacement of the land license. Upon investigation, the replacement document states the owner is Yingxi Temple, and there is no Zhu surname listed. The grain tax receipt also lists the name as Gongli Caishen Temple, which is clearly not private property. Furthermore, the petitioner, Zhu Gongli, has the same name as the "Gongli" in Gongli Caishen Temple, making it difficult to ensure that the words "Caishen Temple" have not been cut off and replaced with the Zhu surname to falsely claim ownership and request assistance from the bureau. Based on these highly unusual facts, the request for a replacement land license should be rejected. You are to be informed that the replacement document and six grain tax receipts should be returned to the bureau with the original submission receipt.</p>
<p>▲Kang Jujing submits a case in compliance with instructions to resubmit grain tax receipts. The submission has been reviewed. Regarding the request to exchange for a land license, now that a response has been submitted and grain tax receipts have been resubmitted, await clear instructions for further review and decision. Two grain tax receipts are to be filed for future reference.</p>
<p>▲Xu Hangsu submits a case requesting to exchange for a land certificate using a previously obtained homestead sketch and to correct the grain tax household. The submission has been reviewed. It is stated that the petitioner owns an ancestral homestead located at Zhao Shigeng Household No. 127 of Beiziwei, 11th map of the 25th Bao. Because the original certificate was lost, a request was submitted for surveying and issuance of a sketch measuring two fen, nine li, and eight hao, requesting an exchange for a Gui land certificate. Since the grain tax receipt has been submitted, await clear instructions for further review and action. The sketch and grain tax receipt are to be filed.</p>
<p>▲Tang Yinquan submits a case requesting the dispatch of personnel for surveying to exchange for a land certificate. The submission has been reviewed. It is stated that the petitioner's ancestral land is located at Tang Siguan Household No. 468 of Yangziwei, 19th map of the 24th Bao, with two fen, one li, and five hao of arable land, requesting surveying and exchange for a certificate. Await clear instructions for further review and action.</p>
<p>▲Chuan Zheng submits a case to submit surveying fees per instructions, requesting the dispatch of personnel for surveying. Submission has been reviewed. Since the surveying fee has been prepaid and the receipt submitted to the bureau, await scheduling and dispatch of personnel for surveying.</p>
<p>▲Cao Quanfu submits a case requesting the prevention of fraudulent land grabbing and the halting of a transfer deed to protect ancestral graves. The submission has been reviewed. It is stated that the petitioner mortgaged nine fen and eight li of land under the Tan Jishen Household No. 239 of Xuziwei, 8th and 9th maps of the 28th Bao, to Cao Yuqing, which is now being perpetually leased to the British company Lita Foreign Firm, requesting the halting of the transfer deed. Because the land is owned by the petitioner, evidence of ownership and grain tax receipts for the last three years should be submitted to the bureau, along with a detailed statement of the mortgage date, middleman's name, and address for further review and action.</p>
<p>▲Pang Daozong, representative of the Linong Company, which is undertaking the construction of public toilets citywide, submits a case requesting the surveying of additional locations for public toilet construction. The submission and attached map have been reviewed. The additional location selected on Wai Xianzhua Street in front of the Great King Temple is reported by the local land guard as the property of Cai Zhesheng, who currently resides in the west wing of the Nanyang Hospital in the Eastern Huangjia Alley within Xiaonanmen. The representative should directly negotiate the terms and contract for lease with the owner and submit it to the bureau for record. In addition to sending a letter to the Finance and Sanitation Bureaus for review and notifying the landowner to negotiate a fair price to aid municipal administration, instructions are hereby given for compliance. The map is to be filed.</p>
<p>▲Xu Peizhen submits a case stating the loss of the receipt for claiming the land certificate and requesting permission to claim the land certificate. The submission has been reviewed. It is stated that the receipt for claiming the land certificate for two fen, three li, and three hao of rural land under the Xu Peizhen Household No. 10, 12th plot, of Tianziwei, 9th map of the Pengpu District, was lost, and a tax submission receipt and grain tax receipt are submitted for claiming the land certificate. Upon verifying the land registry, it is found that the said land was previously pawned to Tan Sichun. If it has now been redeemed, the redemption contract should be submitted to the bureau for verification before further review and action. You are to be informed that the redemption report, tax submission receipt, and grain tax receipt will be temporarily filed.</p>
<p>The above instructions are issued on February 15th by Bureau Chief Zhu Yan.</p>
<p>Instructions</p>
<p>Petitioner Zhang Qisheng and Zhang Qiming submit a case stating that the land certificate was lost and requesting a replacement land license. The submission has been reviewed. It is stated that the petitioners previously reported the loss of a land certificate for three mu, nine fen, and nine li, one hao of arable land under the Zhang Ling Household No. 2, 5th plot, of Baiziwei, 1st map of the Jie District in Zhabei, which was stolen by Gu Genbiao and mortgaged to Gu Xinyi, still requesting a replacement land license. The theft of the land certificate and mortgage involve criminal matters. If the petitioners confirm that the land certificate was stolen by Gu Genbiao, they should file a lawsuit with the relevant court. Because the land certificate is currently being held as collateral by Gu Genbiao and is not lost, a request to issue a replacement land license cannot be submitted according to the procedures for lost land certificates. In addition to withdrawing the original case, you are to be informed of this instruction.</p>
<p>▲Petitioner, Da Da Steamboat Company, represented by Wang, submits a case stating that the land lease should not be canceled according to the law and requesting further review. The submission has been reviewed. The contract previously signed between the municipal authorities and the company did not have provisions allowing the company to sublease, and the company subleased it without obtaining the explicit consent of the former municipal authorities. The company has already violated the contract and is sufficient reason for canceling the contract. Out of consideration, the bureau had repeatedly notified the company during the 17th year of the Republic to come to the bureau to discuss amending the contract provisions to show leniency, but the company delayed and procrastinated without any sincere intention to amend. The bureau then submitted the circumstances to the municipal government for instructions to cancel the contract and received instructions stating that applications from merchants to lease public land should not be approved if they were deemed to hinder the purpose of improving the southern city's coastline and docks. The bureau should comply accordingly. The company does not understand the matter and claims that the bureau does not know what rights are protected by law, which is incorrect. However, since another petition has been submitted, await further review and instruction from the municipal government. This instruction is to be complied with.</p>
<p>▲Petitioner, Gongji Company, submits a case submitting documents and requesting that they be filed, surveyed, and a land certificate be issued. The submission has been reviewed. Await consolidation of cases for review. Furthermore, the company is submitting the case in the name of the company and has not listed the name of the representative or manager in the submission. The submission should state this information for verification. You are to be informed that the land certificate and two replacement documents are to be filed. This instruction.</p>
<p>▲Petitioner, Wang Yide, submits a case stating that the boundary is unclear and requesting surveying to establish the boundary. The submission has been reviewed. It is stated that the petitioner holds a land certificate for one mu, seven fen, and six li, six hao of land under the Yidetang Household No. 12, one plot, of Qingwei in the Jie District of Zhabei. Because the land boundary is unclear, surveying to establish the boundary is requested. The submitted grain tax receipt and land certificate match the household name and acreage in the registry. Since the surveying fee has been prepaid, await the dispatch of personnel for surveying to establish the boundary. The land certificate and grain tax receipt are to be temporarily filed.

<h3>Cultural Propaganda of the Buddhist Laymen's Forest</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Buddhist Laymen's Forest has realized that to promote Buddhism, it is necessary to start with propaganda. Therefore, in addition to giving lectures on scriptures in the forest every Saturday and Sunday and establishing schools, it has also paid special attention to publishing. Over the past ten years, the various publications have reached more than a hundred kinds, with a total quantity exceeding one million copies. The words and sentences are all in keeping with the solemnity of Buddhist scriptures, and they are also different from the difficult-to-understand old-fashioned texts. They are appreciated by all walks of life for being elegant and popular. Recently, as the publications of the forest have been increasing day by day, and the requests from all walks of life to purchase scriptures or send Buddhist books on their behalf have also increased, a Buddhist Bookstore has been specially set up, and a distribution office has been established at the Baoshan Road intersection on the east side of the North Railway Station. It is heard that in order to influence the general youth and scholars, the forest has also started selling textbooks, reference books, and all kinds of Chinese and Western stationery used by various schools at the distribution office. The prices are all very low, in the hope of taking this opportunity to make more connections.</p>
<h3>Grand Commemoration in Caohejing</h3>
<p>Caohejing Town in the Caojing District of this city, since the Qilu war began in the 13th year of the Republic of China, has suffered continuous war disasters. The local gentry of the town took the lead in establishing a defense corps to prevent routed soldiers and strictly investigate bandits. Therefore, while the surrounding villages were devastated, Caohejing was uniquely safe. The local people, in addition to celebrating with their hands on their foreheads, initiated local commemorations. For years, starting from the 21st of this month, lanterns have been hung for three days to show that they do not forget. This year, in addition to all the shops in the town uniformly hanging lanterns and decorations, and five colorful towers being erected at the entrances and exits of the streets, a lantern parade was held last night. Many people from all walks of life sent lanterns as gifts. Huang Jinrong, a prominent figure in Shanghai, also personally sent automated tiger, leopard, lion, and elephant lanterns to join the parade. At 6 pm that evening, those participating in the lantern parade gathered at the large playground of the Qiuzhi School in the town. Liu Lun, the chief of the third sub-precinct of the sixth district of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the captain of the Caojing District Defense Corps, Mr. Ding, each personally led their corps and police to the scene to maintain order. At 8 pm, Tang Shanxia, the commander-in-chief of the parade, supervised the lantern team as they paraded through the entire town for a distance of three Chinese miles. The crowds coming from all directions to watch were overwhelming, and the roads were blocked. At that time, the lights shone brightly, as if it were daytime. Cheers and the sound of firecrackers were incessant. What was most noteworthy was that in front of the lantern team were many "Public Will" lanterns, on which the goals of the public's commemoration and the petition of all merchants to the Municipal Government were published.

<h3>Tenants in Tingyun Lane, French Concession, Oppose Rent Increase Meeting</h3>
<p>The tenants of Tingyun Lane at the intersection of Route Francis Garnier and Avenue Foch in the French Concession, due to two rent increase notices from the landlord, Yiji Company (a Chinese company), ranging from 30% to 40%, have caused a reaction from all tenants. They have petitioned the Municipal Party Headquarters, the General Federation of Tenants in the French Concession, etc. for assistance. The tenants convened a general meeting of all tenants at Jinji Temple at 2 pm yesterday, with over a hundred people attending. The political department of the French Police Department heard of the news and sent two detectives to the scene to monitor, but the tenants' meeting was orderly and there were no radical actions. At the meeting, Yu Jiugao was publicly elected as chairman. After the ceremony, the chairman reported on the illegal rent increase by the landlord. Next, the methods to deal with the situation were discussed and decided: (1) The rent for March will still be paid at the original amount. If the landlord refuses to accept it, the tenants will deposit the original rent into the bank to show their determination and avoid providing an excuse. (2) A committee will be elected by all tenants to handle all negotiations. (3) All expenses incurred during the meeting will be shared by the tenants. Gao Maosheng, Yu Jiugao, Xia Ruyun, Lu Huanzhang, and Xu Shuzhen were elected on the spot as economic custody committee members. (4) Robbery and assault cases often occur in the lane, causing the tenants great panic. Two patrolmen should be hired to guard the lane, and their wages will be paid by each tenant paying an additional eight dimes per month on top of the rent. (5) The executive committee was elected and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Red Pills and Opium Seized in Longhua</h3>
<p>At the Longhua Town Station in western Shanghai, two people suddenly appeared the other day carrying a large wooden box, intending to buy tickets to Hangzhou. They happened to be spotted by Patrol Officer Jia Pengfei of the town's branch station, who found their behavior suspicious. He went forward to conduct a search and found a gramophone inside the wooden box, with red pills underneath, estimated to be about 60,000 to 70,000 pills, and over seventy taels of opium. The people and the loot were sent to the third sub-precinct of the sixth district. After questioning by Chief Liu, the case was deemed to involve smuggling drugs, and a document was immediately prepared to be sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Suing for Unpaid Customs Duties and Water Fees</h3>
<p>Yan, a lawyer representing Zhenda Customs Brokerage, claimed in the French Court that the owner of Yuyuantai had previously entrusted the plaintiff's customs brokerage to handle customs declarations for customers, and successively owed customs duties, water fees, and other expenses totaling 463 yuan. He requested prosecution for non-payment despite repeated demands. The defendant also hired a lawyer to argue that the defendant had already paid this amount to Chen Yufeng, a runner of the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff's receipt could prove this. The plaintiff's lawyer also stated that the plaintiff had never received this amount. The court instructed that personnel be assigned to investigate and verify the matter before further review.</p>
