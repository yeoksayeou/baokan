<p>Shi's troops have been repelled by artillery fire. Jin troops in Kaifeng are gradually retreating north. Xuzhou: The Xuzhou Headquarters reports that Chen Tiaoyuan's 30th telegram states that Shi Yousan's troops, Sun Guangqian and Qin Jianbin, attacked Liu Tongji and Gao Ti Circle on the morning of the 28th, but were repelled by our artillery fire. Our Gu and Xu divisions launched a flanking attack on the enemy from Qingshanji and Kong Youfang. The enemy was overwhelmed and routed, with over a thousand prisoners, over eight hundred rifles, over forty cannons, six machine guns, and countless military supplies seized. Our army followed up in pursuit and occupied Dongming at 4 PM on the 29th. The remaining enemies retreated towards Dingtao. (1st day special dispatch) Nanjing: He Peiji, Chief of Staff of the 8th Route Army, telegraphed to Nanjing that according to reconnaissance reports, the Jin army in Kaifeng is gradually retreating north. (1st day special dispatch) Nanjing: Official announcement: (1) Recently, the rebellious Feng has been actively mobilizing his remaining troops to harass our left flank in order to prevent our army from flanking around. As a result, his direct troops, such as those of the rebels Sun Ji Gao Ge, have been defeated by our army and routed without forming ranks. In the past few days, casualties have reached over ten thousand, and his strength has been almost exhausted. With no other options, the rebellious Feng begged for assistance from the rebellious Yan, offering a large sum of money to persuade the rebellious Shi Yousan to attack our right wing in order to contain us. Shi, motivated by self-interest, led the entire army of Sun Guangqian and Qin Jianbin to attack on the morning of the 28th, advancing towards Liu Tongji and Gaoti Circle. Our army was prepared and remained unfazed. The rebellious troops launched day and night attacks, attempting to break through our lines, but were repelled by our artillery fire. While the situation was stalemated, our Gu and Xu divisions launched a fierce offensive against the enemy's left flank from the direction of Qingshanji. The enemy troops suffered heavy casualties and were increasingly unable to resist, collapsing and scattering. This heavy blow to the rebellious Shi has eliminated eighty or ninety percent of his strength. It is estimated that in this campaign, over a thousand prisoners were captured, along with over eight hundred rifles, four cannons, and six machine guns, as well as countless military supplies. Sun Lianzhong, starting on the morning of the 28th, led three divisions of troops to gradually move south, hoping to attack our army. In order to lure the enemy deep, we ordered our troops to lie in ambush in the areas of Enmu Kou, Dayuan, and Huangcaogang without making any noise. When the enemy's main force entered the vicinity of Ququji, our army surrounded them from all sides. The enemy, caught off guard, attempted to escape, but their rear was cut off by our army, leaving them with no way to advance or retreat. They surrendered in droves, with only two or three out of ten escaping. It is estimated that in this campaign, approximately four thousand officers and soldiers of Gao and Ge's two divisions under the rebellious Sun Lianzhong were captured, along with over five thousand six hundred rifles, thirty siege cannons, and sixteen machine guns, as well as countless military supplies. (1st day special dispatch) Zhang and Gui's military situation is desperate. Chen Jitang ordered all armies to attack from all sides. Huang Xuchu's troops enter Hunan from Guangxi.

<p>Nanjing: Liu Zhennian telegraphed Jiang, saying that due to strategic considerations, Commander-in-Chief Han has shifted his position and has reached the Qingzhou and Weixian area. The wounded soldiers being transported to Weifang should be properly settled by Zhang, the regimental commander of the cavalry under my command. As the day approaches for the rebellious Yan Fangzhang's troops to show their loyalty, I have ordered my subordinates to be on strict alert and have requested instructions from Commander-in-Chief Han. I respectfully request your instructions so that we can annihilate the rebellious enemy. Jiang replied, saying that he was deeply gratified to receive the telegram. The rebellious Yan Fangzhang are united in their hatred of the enemy. It is hoped that you will assist Brother Xiangfang in his operations. Our troops have been advancing and repeatedly defeating the rebellious enemy in recent days. The Pinghan Railway is also advancing at the same time. The final victory will surely belong to our side. Liu telegraphed Jiang again on the 30th, saying that since Commander-in-Chief Han led his troops to shift positions, the rebellious Yan and Zhang's troops have followed along to kill the enemy, showing their righteousness without hesitation. After consulting with Commander-in-Chief Han to coordinate the counterattack, in addition to requesting instructions from Commander-in-Chief Han and continuing to report the situation, I respectfully report.

<h3 id="e5">Withdrawal of Troops from the Rhineland <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>With the completion of the Allied withdrawal from the Rhineland, the Germans, witnessing the lowering of the tricolor flag of the French military headquarters, were overjoyed. Church bells rang to announce the event, and people paraded to celebrate. The military placed wreaths on cemeteries to show friendship, and the people paid tribute to the late Foreign Minister to commemorate his efforts in negotiating the troop withdrawal. The German President and Prime Minister jointly issued a declaration praising the Rhineland people's enthusiasm, patriotism, unwavering loyalty, and celebrating the restoration of the nation's most precious freedom. They also expressed gratitude to the soldiers and civilians who sacrificed for German freedom. They also hoped that the efforts in the Saar region would lead to the Saar's early reunification with the motherland, and looked forward to Germany's future advancement towards glory and jubilation. Amidst the rejoicing, there was also a sense of solemnity and striving. This is truly one of the most moving events in the world. The most tragic event in the world was the Great War ten years ago, and only now has the trace of that war been completely erased. It is fitting that the German people rejoice and be inspired. However, we hope that in the future, not only will the traces of the Great War be erased, but also that the relations between Germany and France will become closer, and that the people of both countries will sweep away the grudges in their hearts. We further hope that the major countries of the world, recognizing the difficulty in eliminating the scars of war, will sincerely advocate for peace and avoid deceiving each other. At this time, when the negotiations for the troop withdrawal after the Great War have just concluded, if the seeds of another major war are sown, it would be truly what the people of the world dread, and the countries that are currently ambitious and competing to expand their armaments should especially think carefully and be cautious.

<h3 id="e9">Export Industry Bears Double Tax <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Beiping: Regarding the issue of the 2% coastal trade tax levied after Shanxi forces seized the Tianjin Customs, although the Tianjin Customs has made concessions to exempt the import tax, other customs offices are unwilling to recognize the export tax paid in Tianjin, clearly constituting a double taxation. As a result, many exporters have stopped exporting. For example, the export of cotton, a major commodity in Shanghai, has completely come to a standstill, which will inevitably cause the industries in North China to decline. At the same time, it will have a major impact on foreign traders and shipping companies. The impact on Japan is particularly significant. The Japanese embassy has sent Secretary Ohashi to Tianjin to discuss the matter with Consul Tajiri of Tianjin, seeking the most appropriate and proper solution. A conclusion has not yet been reached, and it is feared that it will take some time before a compromise can be reached. (1st day Dentsu news dispatch) Northern Political Party Dispute</p>

<p>Beiping: Wang Shizhen passed away from illness at 7 AM this morning at the age of 70. (1st day special dispatch) Beiping: Shi Jingyun came to Beiping today from abroad to engage in activities. In reality, Shi came to handle Wang Shizhen's funeral. Wang Shizhen's will states that since training troops in Xiaozhan, he only knew the country and the people, and did not know himself and his family. At the age of seventy, he is alone and without descendants. He can answer to his conscience without shame. However, the country is plagued by bandits, disasters are frequently seen, and wars are incessant. He hopes that the people and gentlemen of the country will unite in praying for peace so that the situation of reunification can be achieved as soon as possible. I will also be at ease in the afterlife. Family affairs should be handled according to my usual practices. When people die, they become smoke. Be careful not to have extravagant burials. I sincerely urge this. (1st day special dispatch) Beiping: Wang Shizhen, a senior statesman of the Beiyang government and former Prime Minister, suddenly collapsed yesterday due to chest anemia and passed away this morning at the age of seventy-seven. He was from Zhengding County, Zhili Province, and graduated from the Beiyang Military Academy with Duan Qirui. He was one of the three heroes of the Beiyang Army. When Yuan Shikai trained troops at Xiaozhan, he was the commander of the engineering battalion. When Yuan served as the governor of Shandong, he was the chief of the staff office. From the 34th year of Guangxu to the 2nd year of Xuantong, he served as the Jiangbei Chief Military Commander and was subsequently promoted to Vice Minister of the Ministry of War. After Yuan was dismissed, he also resigned. During the Xinhai Revolution, Yuan formed a cabinet and he served as the Minister of the Army. Since the Qing Dynasty had already collapsed, he regarded himself as a remnant official. Yuan repeatedly asked him to come out of retirement, but he refused. In the fourth year of the Republic, he served as the Director of the Directorate Office after Yuan's earnest request. Subsequently, he served as the Minister of the Army and Chief of the General Staff in the cabinets of Xu Shichang and Duan Qirui. After Zhang Xun's restoration failed, he succeeded Duan as Prime Minister in November of the sixth year of the Republic. In December of the ninth year, he succeeded Li Chun as the Inspector General of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi, but declined the position. He was one of the most senior statesmen, indifferent to fame and wealth, and therefore unwilling to participate in political issues. Whenever there was a political change, he was always considered the most suitable candidate for an interim cabinet. When he was forced to come out of retirement, he declined on the grounds of old age. In the winter of the thirteenth year, when Duan Qirui served as the Provisional Chief Executive, he reluctantly assumed the post of Director of the Military Rehabilitation Committee out of friendship. During the conflict between the Zhili and Fengtian armies, he spared no effort to seek peace, which is known to the world. In the seventeenth year, when Zhang Zuolin withdrew from Beijing, he did his best to maintain the治安 of Beijing, which was also his last act of love. (1st day Dentsu news dispatch) Wang Shizhen</p>

<p>The People of the Rhineland Regain Their Freedom</p>
<p>Grand Celebrations in German Cities and Towns</p>
<p>Reuters, May 30, Mainz - The Allied occupation of the Rhineland ended today. The tricolor flag of the French military headquarters was lowered, and the Germans were overjoyed. Minutes after the flag was lowered, the last batch of French soldiers and gendarmes marched in formation to the station and boarded the train. Before leaving, the French troops placed wreaths at the German military cemetery, and the Germans also placed wreaths at the French military cemetery. When the Allied Rhineland High Commissioners held their final meeting, German representatives were also present and exchanged cordial greetings. Tonight, churches throughout the Rhineland will ring their bells to announce the formal end of the occupation, bonfires will be lit on the mountains, and parades and celebrations will be held in cities and towns.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, June 1, Mainz - Within hours of the departure of the last batch of French troops, the situation in the city and surrounding villages had completely changed. As soon as the French flag at the French Commissioner's office was lowered, countless black, red, and yellow flags of the German Republic began to flutter from public and private buildings. As the last column of French soldiers passed in front of a silent crowd, boarding the train to return home, the people of the entire city suddenly awoke from a nightmare, overjoyed to have regained their freedom after eleven years and seven months of foreign rule. In just a few minutes, flags were flying everywhere in the city streets and on the boats along the riverbanks, and people rushed to the streets, laughing wildly and singing. German aircraft also circled in the sky to celebrate the return of freedom to the air. Amidst enthusiastic and enthusiastic welcomes, German police in blue uniforms led the way with military music, marching across the Rhine Bridge into the city. Tens of thousands of farmers from the surrounding countryside, young and old, rushed to the city to participate in the grand event. People everywhere formed teams and went out to destroy all French signs and other symbols of foreign restraint. After a night of revelry and excitement, at midnight, the bells of the churches in Sinsheim, Spayer, Trier, and other towns and villages rang out, and the whistles of ships and factories sounded wildly in response, interspersed with the booming of firecrackers. Throughout the Rhineland, from the mountaintops to the riverbanks and as far as the French border, torches shone everywhere, and the sound of people was like boiling water. Looking down from an airplane, it was as if a vast, moving sea of fire stretched for hundreds of miles. In front of the Mainz City Hall, a sea of people sang the national anthem and hymns of thanksgiving to God, listening quietly to the speech of Interior Minister Wells. Wells' speech was broadcast nationwide by radio, and the gist of it was that he represented the government in thanking the Rhineland people for their loyalty and welcoming their return to the motherland.</p>
<p>Tumin News Agency, May 30, Paris - Today, the Paris newspapers have detailed accounts and lengthy commentaries on the Rhineland withdrawal and the situation in various places. The left-wing newspapers generally expressed their intention to praise the merits of French Foreign Minister Briand and the late German Foreign Minister Stresemann. The right-wing newspapers were more concerned about the dangers of withdrawing French troops, but except for the royalist organ, which denounced the move as a crime harmful to the country, the rest used mild language. Moreover, while the National Newspaper, a Marin faction organ, added a black mourning frame to the news, the extreme left-wing Republican Newspaper regretted that the withdrawal had come too late, greatly reducing the effectiveness of combining French and German relations.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, May 30, London - The British newspapers all have editorials elaborating on the importance of today in European history. The Daily Telegraph reported that the Rhineland withdrawal was the end of a great chapter in the world's tragic history and the beginning of a new era. The other newspapers mostly expressed their deep admiration for the late German Foreign Minister Stresemann's achievements in restoring Rhineland's freedom.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, June 1, Mainz - The French High Commissioner for the Occupied Zone issued a final message last night before leaving, expressing satisfaction that no accidents occurred during the withdrawal of French troops and acknowledging the proper measures taken by officials from both sides. He hoped that this day would mark the beginning of a new era of mutual understanding between the two countries.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, June 1, Berlin - From the evening of Monday to the early morning of Tuesday, celebrations were held throughout Germany, particularly in the Rhineland region, to celebrate the return of freedom. Lantern festivals, fireworks, musical ensembles, and speeches by celebrities were all important parts of the celebrations. In Berlin, the Lushde Park, the Olympic Sports Ground, and other public places were crowded with people singing songs that pierced the sky. Speakers were placed in public places to broadcast the speeches of Interior Minister Wells and others in the Rhineland. In all speeches, the speakers mentioned that the people of Saar were still under foreign chains, and they hoped that they would soon be able to reunite with their motherland.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Fifth Anniversary of the Founding of the National Government <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Tan Yankai Presides, Hu Hanmin Speaks</p>
<p>The fifth anniversary commemoration of the founding of the National Government was held this morning (the 1st) at 10:00 AM in the auditorium of the National Government. Tan Yankai, Hu Hanmin, Sun Ke, Dai Chuanxian, Zhu Peide, Gu Yingfen, Wang Boqun, Wang Zhengting, Kong Xiangxi, Jiang Menglin, Niu Yongjian, Shao Yuanchong, Yi Peiji, Zhang Wohua, Zhu Luhe, Wei Daoming, Zheng Hongnian, Qiu Ao, and hundreds of other civil and military officials of the National Government attended. After Chairman Tan Yankai performed the ceremony as usual, Chairman Tan delivered the opening address, stating that today is the fifth anniversary of the founding of the National Government. Recalling that five years ago today, the Liu Yang rebellion had not yet been quelled, and the National Government was founded at that time. However, its distant cause was due to the Premier taking office as President in Guangzhou. The intermediate period went through Chen Jiongming's rebellion, and the Premier organized the Grand Marshal's Office. The National Government was established on this basis. After the Northern Expedition, the capital was established in Nanjing. Its system is still based on the previous rules, and then there is a unified situation in China. In the past, when the Premier was in Guangzhou, his environment was more difficult and arduous than it is today. We can recall the Premier's spirit of struggling through difficulties and hardships at any time. Today, we commemorate the founding of the National Government, and we should carry forward and promote the Premier's spirit of struggle. We must work a hundred times harder than before. Therefore, today's memorial meeting cannot be said to be a celebration, but rather an inspection of ourselves and an extra effort. Next, Hu Hanmin gave a speech, stating that five years ago today, the National Government was founded in Guangzhou based on the Premier's Grand Marshal's Office. However, at that time, the political organs were not yet complete. The First National Congress proposed the outline of national construction and established the government. However, the Premier believed that the warlords had not yet been eliminated and that saving the country and the people was the most important thing, so he decided to go north. When the Premier was ill in Beijing, the comrades in charge of military and political affairs in Guangdong believed that a government should be established to take responsibility for the national revolution. Therefore, the decision was made at the base camp to establish a government and change it to a committee system. At that time, Chairman Chiang was unwilling to participate as a member. Recalling that five years ago, the Premier entrusted the cause of national revolution to his comrades and established a government, not a government in form, but a government for the people and the country that based itself on doctrines and accepted all of the Premier's teachings. However, at that time, Liu Yang had not yet been eliminated, and there were still strong and stubborn warlords in the north. It was not until the Northern Expedition, which developed from the Yangtze River to Bing, that the capital was established in Nanjing in the seventeenth year. Then, the Beijing government was abolished, China was unified, and the five yuan were organized. This was the result of the efforts of many civil and military comrades, and it was also the spirit of the party that enabled political progress to be so rapid. Five years ago, the National Government issued a declaration on how to abolish unequal treaties, how to rescue the people from the iron hooves of warlords, and how to move from military government to tutelage government to constitutional government. In these five years, perhaps some of these things have not yet been done, or perhaps there are still obstacles like Chen Jiongming. Therefore, the disbandment conference was convened last year in the belief that unification could be achieved from then on. Unexpectedly, when we speak of unification, some people seize territory. When we speak of consolidating the National Government, some people destroy the National Government. We have used many methods to guide them onto the right track, but they refuse to get on the right track. The government is a government for the people. We must plan for the people everywhere and cannot allow them to destroy a government that has already been recognized by the world and is about to move from tutelage to constitutional government. Therefore, we have no choice but to use force, and we are very reluctant to do so. Now, our army is clearing obstacles for the people. All military and political comrades must make special efforts in the rear. President Tan said that the National Government was a hundred times more difficult in Guangzhou than it is now, but it was able to overcome difficulties. We must double our efforts to build the future. Those who oppose the government cannot come up with policies and only attack two or three private individuals arbitrarily, spreading rumors, which is equivalent to robbery. Anyone with a little common sense will not be deceived by them. Chairman Chiang often says that military affairs are 100% certain, but he is worried about politics. If politics are not done well, there is no way to live up to the sacrifices of the martyrs and the Premier's forty years of struggle. Therefore, when we participate in this meeting, we should follow President Tan's words and inspect ourselves so as not to fail today's grand meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Traffic on the Jiaoji and Jinpu Railways <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Communication - A section of the railway track near Guodian Station on the Jiaoji Railway was dismantled yesterday, causing a temporary disruption of traffic. Westbound trains to Zaoyuanzhuang were turned back to Qingdao, and eastbound trains from Jinan were suspended for one day yesterday. The head of the Transportation Department, Japanese national Kaga Yamato, departed from Qingdao by special train on the 25th. When Han Fuju's train arrived at Xindian, Kaga Yama communicated with Han by telephone, and Han immediately agreed to telegraph orders to the troops not to detain the train. The Railway Bureau then rushed to send people to repair the track at Guodian. Kaga Yama arrived in Jinan by special train at night and returned to Qingdao this morning. The third and fifth trains that were supposed to arrive in Jinan on the 25th only arrived in Jinan at noon today (the 26th). The fourth train this afternoon departed from Jinan East as usual, but there were too many troop trains along the way, and the train was moving very slowly. Liu Encheng arrived from Tianjin by special train yesterday with engineering, mechanical, and electrical personnel to inspect the railway along the way. He arrived at Luokou on the north bank of the Yellow River at 2:00 PM this afternoon, where he was greeted by engineering director Hu Shenghong and others. They inspected the damaged condition of the railway bridge together. After the inspection, they crossed the river by boat and took the train prepared by Jinan Station to Jinan. He told reporters that he had come specifically to inspect the Yellow River Railway Bridge and prepare for its repair. Passenger trains can travel to Yucheng, and troop trains can travel to the north bank of the Yellow River. The entire railway telephone line has been repaired, and traffic will be fully restored soon. Liu gave a speech to the railway staff in the reception hall, saying that the railway traffic has been damaged beyond repair, and he hoped that everyone would treat the railway as their own business and work hard to repair it. Finally, Liu summoned the two engineering directors, Hu Shenghong and Chen Zuyi, the director of the Dahuaizhan factory, Zeng Guangzhi, Qin Wenfan, and Wang Kaizhi from the Machinery Department, Ji Quan from the Engineering Department, and Li Baoheng, the head of the Jinan Train Station, to discuss the bridge repair plan. It is heard that repairs can be completed and traffic restored within two weeks, as the damage to the bridge is relatively easy to repair. (June 26)</p>
<h3 id="e60">Russian Conference, Russia's Attitude is to Wait and See <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Multiple contacts have not yet yielded progress.  Harbin-based Japanese consul describes the current situation.  Harbin Dispatch, 24th:  Mo Teh-hui departed for Russia on May 1st, arriving in Moscow on the 9th.  Almost two months have passed since then, but there is still no definite news on when the Sino-Russian conference will be convened. Although the relevant agencies here have received one or two telegrams from Moscow, none are related to conference matters.  Therefore, the extent of progress in formal Sino-Russian talks is like a mystery. It is feared that only the representatives in Russia know the content. Even the British Asia News Agency, which usually promotes the Soviet Union, has recently had no records of the conference.  The other day, Tanaka Bunjirō, the Japanese consul general in Moscow, returned from Russia and passed through Harbin on his way back to Japan.  A certain newspaper reporter went to inquire about the Sino-Russian conference news he heard in Russia.  Tanaka, when he departed from Russia, was hosted at a farewell banquet in the train by Mo Teh-hui, so he said he had heard about this matter. According to him, the future of the Sino-Russian conference is bleak. This is not just pessimistic talk; in fact, the plenipotentiaries of both sides have contacted each other several times, but the results have not been satisfactory. The Russian side insists that the Bery Agreement is valid, like an ironclad guarantee, and allows no room for negotiation. It believes that although China cannot issue a declaration stating that the Bery Agreement is completely valid before the conference, it must also acknowledge, at a minimum, that formal conference negotiations will proceed based on the Bery records. Moreover, draft proposals must be agreed upon by both sides before they can be submitted for exchange and review. Although the Soviet Union outwardly says this is to avoid disputes and reduce conflicts at the conference table in the future, in reality, it completely aims to restrict China's ability to redeem the railway and only discuss the East China Railway issue. China's plenipotentiary, Mo, is in a dilemma because of the unstable domestic political situation, the lack of direction in foreign policy, and the lack of instructions from those in charge. The Soviet Union also hopes that there will be changes in the Chinese political situation, so it is currently waiting and watching for an advantageous opportunity before proceeding with conference contacts. For the sake of Chinese diplomacy, it is necessary to quickly achieve a unified situation, either by the Nanjing government or by the Northeast authorities, to provide responsible instructions to the plenipotentiary on foreign policy, so as to avoid its plenipotentiary representative becoming at a loss. Otherwise, the Sino-Russian conference will be within sight but unattainable.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Rampant Russian Bandits on the Ha-Man Line <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Besieging Hake Station, driven back by the 15th Brigade. Harbin Dispatch, 24th: The White Russian bandits in Sanhe Town, Shivei County, were previously suppressed by the 8th Regiment of Cheng Zhiyuan's 2nd Cavalry Brigade of the Heilongjiang Army. The bandits rely on the mountains and forests as a shield and appear and disappear unpredictably. Whenever the troops advance, they retreat into the mountains and forests. As soon as the troops leave, they come out and harass. This has been going on for half a year without being pacified. Furthermore, taking advantage of the troops' fatigue from running around, the bandits demanded that the Heilongjiang authorities incorporate them into the regular army, putting forward the following demands: (1) After incorporation, the current Russian, Zhu Kuofuv, will remain the leader, with Xiao Yu appointed as regimental commander. (2) Replenish firearms, ammunition, horses, uniforms, and provisions. (3) Continue to garrison Sanhe Town and not be arbitrarily transferred elsewhere. (4) Salaries and rations will be issued monthly by Hulunbuir. The authorities refused to agree, considering the conditions too harsh and fearing that incorporation would further fuel the bandits' arrogance. On the one hand, they continued to order Cheng's brigade to severely suppress the Russian bandits. Recently, they also entrusted an American missionary, Pastor Martin, who was going to Inner Mongolia to preach, to intercede with the military authorities, earnestly requesting incorporation. The matter has not yet been agreed upon. Recently, the bandits, feeling the urgency of the military's search, fled to the grasslands of Inner Mongolia. A group of over 400 Mongol, Han, and Russian bandits from Sejie attacked Hake Station on the Ha-Man Line on the evening of the 20th, intending to seize the station, destroy communications, intercept the direct passenger train from Harbin to Moscow, loot passengers, create terror on the western line, and kidnap important passengers to coerce the authorities into incorporating them. Hake is about sixty li from Hulunbuir, with a platoon of infantry and a dozen policemen stationed there. On the evening of the attack, the Russian bandits, with their superior numbers, attacked at about 9:00 PM. The military police were outnumbered and unable to resist, so they withdrew from the station. After the bandits entered the station, they occupied the station building, cut the telephone and telegraph lines, and demolished a section of the railway, setting up a tight ambush, quietly waiting for the Harbin train to pass by on the morning of the 21st to take action. However, after the garrison troops withdrew from Hake, they rushed back to Hailar overnight and reported to the Hulunbuir Garrison Command. The command immediately dispatched the troops of the 38th Regiment in two sections, carrying several machine guns, by special train. They arrived at Hake at about 11:00 PM that night and launched a fierce siege on the bandits. At first, the bandits stubbornly resisted, but later, unable to withstand the machine gun fire, they suffered eight casualties and, realizing they were no match, abandoned the bodies and fled. Hake Station was immediately restored that night. On the 21st, after workers repaired the electric wire rails, traffic was restored at noon. Hulunbuir Commander Su Bingwen has hastily returned to office to plan a thorough suppression strategy to eradicate the roots. However, the Russian bandits have not gone far and are still wandering near the railway line, still intending to try again. (24th)</p>

<p>Including Feng Tianzhu, Zou Pengzhen, and 44 others. Changsha Dispatch: During Zhang Gui's attack on Hunan, some Hunan provincial personnel colluded with Zhang Gui's army. He Jian strictly ordered all departments to thoroughly investigate and punish them. Yesterday, He issued another circular telegram from Hengzhou, ordering the strict arrest of Feng Tianzhu and 44 others. The telegram reads as follows: (1) "Recently submitted to Commander-in-Chief He and Director He, a telegram stating that the treasonous acts of Gui and Zhang are a disaster for Hunan. All with blood in their veins are filled with rage. However, upon investigation, a group of affiliates willingly turned traitor, acting as accomplices, extorting funds by draining the pond to catch the fish, and allowing soldiers to plunder the people, disregarding all rules and regulations, causing widespread resentment. The crimes of Zhang and Gui are due in no small part to the assistance of these affiliates. Without strict punishment, how can we demonstrate our resolve? Except for Liu Qingchu, who has already been requested for arrest in a separate telegram, and Jing Siyou, the false administrative committee member and special envoy to western Hunan, who has already been arrested, all members of the false War Zone Political Affairs Committee, including Feng Tianzhu, Zou Pengzhen, Guo Anguo, Xin Fengzhuo, Kui Lü Mengxiong, Yan Fanggui, Tang Yan, Dai Xingbing, Wang Yi'e, members of the false party takeover committee, Hu Naian, Xiong Kehuan, Ouyang Jiu, Chen Fangdu, Yan Changsheng, Zheng Changfan, the false public security bureau chief, Chen Rong, the false salt transport bureau chief, He Xuan, the false army commander, Tang Zheming, Tang Shengming, Wang Xi, Yan Fangyi, Li Zemin, He Gan, Tang Xing, etc., either seized the opportunity to usurp party and government positions, taking office as false officials, extorting public and private property, or incited troops and recruited local militia as tools for rebellious enemies and bandits, plunging the area into devastation. The crimes of these traitors in Hunan are evident. It is requested that a strict order be issued for their arrest and prosecution in accordance with the law, to uphold justice and suppress the rise of chaos. Awaiting your inspection and order to implement. Respectfully submitted by He Jian." (Seal affixed) (2) "In this campaign to defeat the rebellious Gui and Zhang, all those who affiliated with them and harmed the people have been listed for arrest in a circular telegram to maintain order and discipline. A telegram has also been sent to the central government requesting the arrest of the main offenders. Upon investigation, it has been found that Wang Kuang, Pei Yixi, Liang Yang Zhenhua, Fu Dingyi, Yi Weiyang, Qi Changlong, Lei Zeyuan, Li Xuan, Xia Han Hua, Tan Bing, Xu Hanchen, Tang Qingyun, Chen Zongze, Fang Weizhen, Mao Zhenxian, Liang Minjie, Ge Yun, Nan Anmin, Tang Jihou, and 19 others are also confirmed to have affiliated with the rebellion. Their personal integrity is low, and they are eager for honor and profit, which is not worth mentioning. However, to rectify discipline, they should be arrested together. In addition to sending a telegram to the provincial government to instruct the counties to specifically investigate and arrest them, a special telegram is sent to instruct your department to strictly arrest them together and bring them to justice in accordance with the law. However, you must not use this as an excuse to search and disturb the innocent, which would be subject to strict investigation. Commander-in-Chief He Jian." (Seal affixed) (June 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e63">Yangtze River Rises Over Twenty Feet <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The water level of the Yangtze River's upper reaches has risen sharply by more than twenty feet in the past ten days. The rapid current flows eastward, and the waves are turbulent. Tragic boat capsizing incidents on the Wuhan river surface are a daily occurrence. The small ferries traveling between Wuhan and Jing, loaded with passengers, were heading towards the pontoons of the Jianghanguan Customs around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. As they were about to dock, they were suddenly hit by a wave and turned towards the center of the river. A small steamer from behind was also deflected by the force of the water. The helmsman was unable to control it, and it slammed into the ferry. The ferry's stern was torn apart, and river water entered through the windows. The boat gradually began to sink. Fortunately, more than a hundred boats along the riverbank rushed forward to rescue the passengers on board, and a tugboat towed the ferry into the factory, saving hundreds of passengers from the tragedy of drowning. Unexpectedly, around 9:00 PM on the 28th, the Wu'an commercial steamer, while sailing near the Jianghanguan Customs, turned its rudder carelessly due to the surging river waves and crashed into the Jardine Matheson pontoon. The boiler exploded, and the fire compartment was shattered. The ship immediately sank, and all the workers and staff on board, more than ten people, were drowned. Because there are no ferries on the beaches of Parrot Island and Baisha Island, merchants and civilians crossing the river must take rowboats. At 1:00 PM on the 29th, a small rowboat carrying three passengers was heading upstream from Baisha Island when it was overturned by the angry waves in the middle of the river. The passengers and boatman were all drowned. Moreover, the river water has been rising continuously for days. According to some people, the sudden rise in river water this time is reddish in color, indicating a major flood in Sichuan. The rising trend is just beginning. Fang Dazhi, the Director of the Hubei Water Conservancy Bureau, fearing that the embankments along the river will be in danger, has recently sent out eighty flood prevention personnel, led by engineers, carrying funds to inspect and repair the embankments in various counties along the river. In areas where bandits and communists have not been cleared, a request has been submitted to the General Headquarters to dispatch troops for protection. (June 30th)</p>

<p>The implementation of the Zhejiang Province straw hat donation and merchant-recognized office, originally scheduled for July 1st, has been postponed by order of the Department of Finance due to insufficient preparation. The long-distance telephone lines in Wenling and Changshan, Zhejiang Province, have been completed and are now open for calls. Staff are currently being dispatched to set up branch offices.</p>
<p>The joint transportation method of the Provincial Highway Bureau's Hang-Mo (Hangzhou-Moganshan) bus service and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway began yesterday. The bus departs from the City Station for Moganshan at 2:15 PM every day. The yarn merchants from the six counties under Jiaxing Prefecture, feeling that the increased tax rate after the Department of Finance took back the official operation of the yarn donation was unbearable, specially sent representatives to Hangzhou to petition the provincial government and the Department of Finance to reduce the donation rate to the same level as Jiangsu Province, but have not yet obtained a response. The Department of Construction ordered the Navigation Bureau to take over the inland navigation business of the China Merchants Bureau. Chen Yi has been appointed as the director of the Zhejiang Provincial Navigation Bureau's Inland Steamship Business Office, concurrently serving as the general manager of the China Merchants Bureau's Inland Steamship Bureau. Yesterday, he, along with Hong Jiayi and Shu Zhendong, technicians from the Department of Construction, went to Shanghai and then to Jiahu and other areas to take over.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Chao-Mei Bandit News <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Various counties urgently hope for military officers to advance and suppress. Xiang Hanping plans to inspect various counties. Shantou Dispatch: In various counties of Chaozhou and Meizhou, the local communists are rampant, ravaging the local people, who are living in dire straits. For example, on the 12th, the local bandits in Fengshun County captured Jiuhe Township, Luohuang District. All the men, women, old, and young in the township fled. Several able-bodied men were captured, doused with kerosene, and burned alive. Such inhumanity is commonplace. Others who could not escape were either scalded with boiling water or beaten to death with thorny sticks. On the 23rd, taking advantage of the transfer of the Luohuang garrison, the bandits attacked Luohuang, whose guards were outnumbered and unable to resist. Luohuang was captured and two Luohuang public schools and five or six shops were burned, and there was extensive looting. On the 24th, Chen Ju's regiment sent a battalion, together with the Special Task Battalion of Huang Hanlin's unit from Chaoan, to drive away the local communists. Luohuang is the fourth district of Fengshun and a commercial port on the right bank of the Han River. A company of guards is stationed in Huangjin City, Baitou, Huangdong, and Wei Township. Although there are local militias, their strength is very weak and they cannot compete with the bandits. When Luohuang was captured on the 23rd, the communist bandits distributed leaflets in Dasha Keng, Baitou Township, Fengliu Men, and Gaosha Township. The bandits led by Pan Tianji and She Huangji were also very active, ambushing and killing more than forty merchants carrying goods on their shoulders at Baifenpu Xikengping. All the goods were looted. The main force of the communist bandits, led by Li Mingguang, set up a headquarters in Baixi, proclaiming that they would seize Luohuang Huangjin City within ten days and cut off Han River traffic. Since the 23rd, the ferries up and down the Han River have been suspended due to the bandits. Moreover, above Luohuang, in Shigou and Chanxi, local communists are gathering to loot civilian boats. Boatmen must form gangs and hire merchant guards to escort them before daring to pass. The newly appointed magistrate of Fengshun County, He Naiying, specially requested 6,000 rounds of ammunition from the 62nd Division and brought them with him to take office. The difficulty of being the magistrate of Fengshun County can be imagined. Dabuzhen County, which is adjacent to Fengshun, has several hundred communist bandits holding up the red flag of the Dabuzhen Revolutionary Committee Military Affairs Committee Special Task Force. On the 22nd, they invaded Dangxi and engaged in a battle at Yintan Aoshan with the police force of Guo Hanyuan, the director of the Dama United Defense. The police force killed more than ten bandits, and the bandits retreated to the Fujian border. Currently, the local communists in various districts of the county are still carrying out large-scale activities. The following is the text of the joint telegram from various Dabuzhen County agencies requesting troops: "We humbly report that Dabuzhen County is surrounded by bandit territory. In recent months, those who have been ravaged by bandits account for seven or eight out of ten. For example, Shiyun, Dabu Corner, Baihou, Dashen, Nanshan in Pudong, Zaicheng, Changzhi, Zhangxi, Yanshang in Pubei, Dama, Yinjiang, Dangxi in Puxi, Gaobei, Chishui, Sanzhou, and Taohua in Punan have been successively lost, burned, and killed. The situation is extremely tragic. Although the defense forces have carried out suppression operations one after another, they cannot suppress this fleeing. The transfer of troops loses protection, and the police teams in various districts are weak. The people have fled, the commercial market is closed, and the citizens are cut off. Representatives have witnessed the tragedy and crawl to Shantou to humbly request the dispatch of troops to divide and defend and suppress the bandits on behalf of the 300,000 souls of the entire county." Furthermore, Xingning, Wuhua, and Meixian, which are adjacent to the northern border of Fengshun, have also been greatly disturbed by communist bandits. Anliu, Meilin, Shuangtou, Shangxiaba, and Shangshan eight villages in Wuhua County have long been under the control of the communist bandit Gu Dacun. In Meixian, the villages of Shekeng, Shuiche, Guantang, Xintang, and Changsha in the upper reaches of the Mei River are often harassed by bandits who block the river and rob ships, obstructing the waterway. Recently, bandits stationed in Shekengxu and waved red flags across the river. Gu Dacun invaded Xingning Zoudong on the 19th but was defeated by the local militia there. On the 21st, he again gathered more than a thousand local communists from Jiulongzhang on the Meifeng border and attacked Xingning Putou Dam Shuikou Shekeng police team at dawn. The police team rose up to rescue them. The battle continued until the afternoon. Zhang Ying's camp of the Xingning garrison and a company of government troops stationed in Dili Xiang crossed the river from Shekeng and attacked Gu Dacun's rear. The local communists were attacked from both sides and collapsed towards Fozigao, Xiaosang, and other places in the evening. The military police cooperated to pursue and suppress them, killing more than a hundred bandits and seizing a large number of reactionary publications and military supplies. They pursued them for more than thirty li before returning. Currently, Gu Dacun has retreated to Xiashe Maokeng Songkeng and other places. Various counties are eagerly awaiting the government troops to launch a large-scale suppression and have repeatedly sent representatives to Shantou to request troops from Xiang Hanping, commander of the 63rd Division. It is heard that Xiang plans to inspect various counties during the day and transfer Luo Weiying's unit, which is returning to the province from Wuzhou, to Chaozhou and Shantou to assist in defense. He will also transfer Luo Xiuli's supplementary regiment from Zhaoqing to garrison Huizhou, Hailufeng, and other counties. After returning to Shantou from the inspection, he may plan to encircle and suppress the communist bandits. (June 26th) Local Communications</p>

<p>The County's Organizing Committee Propaganda Department held a grand meeting at the County Party Department Auditorium at 9:00 AM yesterday to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the establishment of the National Government. About 100 representatives from all walks of life attended the ceremony. The Fengjing robbery and murder case was reported yesterday. It is now known that the victim of the robbery and murder case in Fengjing Fenwutou, map 26, was a farmer named Hua Jinxian, who lived in Hujia with his elderly father, Hua Yinquan. They made a living by farming and had no savings. Around 9:00 PM on the 20th day of the lunar May, more than ten bandits broke into the small house and beat them. They tied up Yinquan and his son and demanded silver dollars. When they failed to get them, they beat them severely. Finally, they gave them forty silver dollars. The bandits were still not satisfied and set a date for them to pay a certain amount again on the 28th at the South Railway Station in Shanghai. Only after this agreement was reached were they released. After robbing the farmer, they lost a lot of money, and they really couldn't raise the money for the agreed-upon payment. The bandits, seeing that they hadn't come by the deadline, broke into the house around 10:00 PM on the 28th of last month. Hua Jinxian had just unlocked the door when he was shot and killed by the bandits. The bandits left after their goal had been achieved. The old father was extremely saddened by the sight and almost fainted. He reported the incident to the authorities the next day. It is now known that the county government has sent Secretary Zhang Shengwu to investigate and has immediately ordered the water and land police under its jurisdiction to strictly investigate and arrest the perpetrators.</p>

<p>A robbery and assault case occurred in the sixth district. Tang Longyuan, a patrol officer at the first police station of the sixth sub-bureau of the sixth district of Wuyi, reported to the Public Security Bureau on the 30th that the home of Zhang Boyuan, the deputy village head of Xiaoliu Village in his jurisdiction, had been robbed and requested an investigation. It is reported that the robbers all spoke with local accents. The couple was burned and beaten, suffering severe injuries. They lost 140 yuan in cash and many items of clothing. The robbers also fired seven or eight shots as a warning. Zhang was afraid of offending the robbers and did not want to report the case. The police station, as its duty, reported the case and is investigating.</p>
<p>The bandit leader was arrested at Henglin Station. Song Xida, the bandit leader in the robbery case at Chen Fusheng's home near Wantapu in the seventh district of Wuyi, was hiding in Henglin. Around 3:00 PM on the 30th, he was about to board a train at the station when he was spotted by He Guoyuan, an inspector from the second district of the Provincial Water Police Team. He immediately telephoned Ni Gusheng, the town captain, who, along with the 3rd Company of the Military Police and the 6th Sub-Bureau of the Public Security Bureau, led their troops to the station and captured the bandit leader Song Xida. After a brief interrogation, he was immediately escorted to the Wuxi district headquarters for interrogation.</p>

<p>Reactions to Road Widening. Yao Dixing, the Director of the Wuxi County Construction Bureau and the Director of the Municipal Engineering Office, believes that the streets in the urban area are unusually narrow and uneven. Therefore, he decided to widen Sanxiatang Zhijie first, in two steps. The first step is to widen the road to six meters (approximately 20 feet) at once. The second step will be to widen it to nine meters (approximately 30 feet). If the houses in the area need to be rebuilt, they will be gradually widened according to this standard to facilitate traffic. He had already sent personnel to survey and prepare a plan to be submitted to the Department of Construction for approval. Unexpectedly, Tao Guanshi, the town head of the Central District, and Qian Baohua, a citizen, took the initiative to oppose it and submitted a request to the Construction Bureau to withdraw the people's lives. Yesterday, local elders Hua Yisan, Yang Changyuan, Wei Zhiwen, and others gathered 34 people and jointly submitted a request to the Construction Bureau to comply with the people's wishes and stipulate that all houses along Sanxiatang be widened to 20 feet when they are rebuilt and gradually reach full completion over a number of years. Director Yao, after receiving the request, stated that since the road widening plan had been submitted to the Department of Construction for approval, he should wait for the department's approval to handle it.</p>
<p>The verdict in the Miao Bin extortion case. Street ruffians Deng Asan, Lü Yulian, and Hang Bingkui sent letters to extort Miao Bin, the former Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. The Water and Land Police Team, disguised, designed to arrest the above-mentioned criminals one after another. After being taken to the bureau, they were transferred to the county for research. All three confessed to the extortion case. Realizing that there was no way out, Hang Bingkui's parents kowtowed to Mrs. Miao, requesting that she find a way to forgive and spare their ignorance. Yesterday, Magistrate Sun signed and brought the three criminals Deng, Lü, and Hang to be re-tried. He instructed them in court that they should all be sentenced to death for the crimes they had committed, but they were leniently treated due to their ignorance and were each sentenced to two years of imprisonment for attempted extortion.</p>
<p>The prime suspect in the joint robbery of the Yinan Tax Card was arrested. On March 25th, at 6:00 PM, the Julongqiao branch of the Yinan Tax Office was robbed by bandits. The water police guarding the card and 236 yuan and 56 cents in tax funds, as well as 353 yuan in private funds from the employees, and 1,300 yuan from a freight friend named Wang Daoduan who was staying overnight at the branch, were all robbed. After the incident, Wang Youlong, the director of the office, reported to Wang Chengguo, the captain of the 9th team of the 2nd District of the Water Police stationed at the card, who successively arrested Shao Jinsheng and six others, who confessed that the bandit leader was named Song Xidu, who had committed numerous crimes and had now fled without a trace. Yesterday, Ni Gusheng, the captain of the Detective Team of the 2nd District of the Water Police stationed in Wuxi, learned that the bandit leader Song Xidu was hiding in Henglin. He immediately led the detectives to the station, where Song was about to board a train to escape. He immediately reported to the station's military police, who cooperated to capture Song and temporarily escorted him to the military police company headquarters in preparation for his return to Yixing for interrogation.</p>
<p>The opening date of the Xicheng Highway. Since the Construction Bureau actively worked on the Xicheng Highway, the entire road project was 80-90% complete by the end of last month.

<p>Detained a suspect in the Shanghai massacre of seven lives. Yang Bingwei of the Public Security Bureau's Detective Team reported that Han Bingsheng and Sun Heshang's house in Lujia Garden in the city had three suspicious people who spoke with a Shanghai accent, Zhu Tingyu, Zhu Ronggui, and Xiao Yunjun, who were suspected of being involved in the massacre of seven lives at Guo Chunsen's home on Aiwanyi Road to Delhi in Shanghai on April 25th. Captain Yang led the team to Sun Heshang's house in the garden in the afternoon and arrested Zhu Tingyu and the other two. They searched the house and found many leather bags, foot baskets, and silk clothes, as well as Buddhist books, women's clothing, half-length photos of a man dressed as a woman, and photos taken with an old woman and an old nun in Hangzhou. They took them to the team headquarters for interrogation. According to Zhu Tingyu, he was 24 years old, originally lived in Yaojiawan, Dadongmen, Shanghai, and now lives in Sanlintang, Pudong. He opened the Yifeng Wood Firm in Dongjiadu. His manager was Hong Baosheng. His father's name was Zhu Shaoqi, who was retired in Hong Kong and had previously served as the director of the Jiujiang Police Department. He left home with his stepmother in March of this year. Zhu Ronggui was from Chuansha Dongwai and came to his home last winter as a servant. Xiao Yunjun was his fellow apprentice and was a plasterer from Jinqiao, Jiangyin. After the three of them came to Cheng, they lived in the house of his adoptive mother, Han Naisheng. His words had nothing to do with the Guo case. After comparing them with the photo of Guo Songan published in the Shanghai newspaper on April 27th, they did not look alike. However, his story was bizarre. He had been in Jiangyin for more than two months, never leaving the house all day. He lived extravagantly, was a vegetarian, and recited the Buddha's name. He burned tin foil Guanyin scriptures and the Great Compassion Mantra every day. Zhu and Xiao claimed to be servants. The villagers in the garden called Tingyu the Fourth Young Master. There was also a servant-like person living there on May 28th, but she disappeared yesterday. It is difficult to determine whether Zhu Tingyu is his real name. In the evening, he was sent to the headquarters for further interrogation, but he did not provide any definite information and his words were contradictory. It is worth studying. Zhu Tingyu claimed that there was an accountant named Kang Shuitian living on Ningbo Road, who could collect 20,000 yuan in rent every month. Today (the 1st), Detective Team members He Atong and Wu Shanbao were ordered to go to Shanghai for detailed investigation before verifying the matter.</p>

<p>The county magistrate's office expenses will still be paid as before. The former Jiangsu Provincial Government, in order to implement austerity measures, intended to remove the item of office expenses for county magistrates from the budget for the 19th year. However, Hu, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, believed that the duties of county magistrates were very heavy. If this office expense was removed, virtuous officials would face the risk of personal losses due to public affairs, while unscrupulous officials would be tempted to seek illegal compensation. The desire for transparency would be hindered. Moreover, the total amount of this office expense for the whole year was only about 160,000 to 170,000 yuan, which was not much for the provincial treasury to spend, but the impact on the future of administration would be significant. Therefore, he specially requested the provincial government to continue to provide it in order to encourage integrity. The provincial government has already passed it in a meeting.</p>
<p>The education community in Taicang came to the province to petition. People from the education community in Taicang believed that the director of the county's education bureau regarded the education bureau as his own, disregarding public opinion and harboring private intentions, so that education was not progressing. Yesterday, they specially sent representatives to the province and prepared a petition to the provincial government, listing the director's various illegal activities.

The details have been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. Now it is known that the school board of the middle school decided to suspend the school temporarily because the school was robbed and the people were panicked, and submitted a report to the Department of Education for filing. The Department of Education replied yesterday, saying that the school's sudden robbery was an extraordinary event, and that the whole school was panicked. However, a school that is known for its achievements should not be shut down, which would not only violate the original intention of the school board to educate talents, but also affect the academic future of hundreds of students. The school board has worked hard in the past and should continue to maintain and improve the school to create future talents. Furthermore, after the school board decided to suspend the school, the students were deeply opposed to it, so they organized a school protection movement committee to call on all sectors of society for assistance, sent letters to all school board members to encourage them to maintain the school, and sent representatives Zhu Huancai, Luo Jieren, and Zhang Shijun on the 22nd to request assistance from various agencies. County Magistrate Chen, Education Bureau Director Che, and the secretary of the County Party Department all met with them and believed that it was very inappropriate to close Chunhui Middle School, which has a history in Zhejiang Province, due to the robbery. Therefore, they expressed their sympathy for the school protection movement committee organized by Chunhui students and planned to immediately call on the provincial government's Department of Education to find ways to maintain it. On the 24th, representatives Luo Jieren, Tao Siqi, Luo Wenhua, and Zhu Huancai went to Hengshan to meet with the school owner, Chen Qiushan, but were unable to meet him. Later, they went to the school board member Chen Yizhai's place to state their intentions and appeal to the advantages and disadvantages of suspending the school in Hui, and the suffering of more than 400 students who were struggling to find education.

However, it is reported that some universities still do not pay much attention to the memorial week or make mistakes in the format.

<p>Oath of Office:</p>
<p>"We swear to accept the entrustment of all members of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce with utmost sincerity, abide by the charter, work hard to serve, not seek personal gain, and not be derelict in our duties. If we violate this oath, we are willing to accept the most severe sanctions from all members. We solemnly swear."</p>
<p>Admonitory Speech from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce: Minister of Industry and Commerce, Kong Xiangxi, could not attend in person and specially sent Mr. Zhao Jinqing to participate. Mr. Zhao stood up and read the admonitory speech, saying: "Shanghai is the center of the world's industry and commerce, and also the hub of economic development in East Asia. Therefore, it occupies an extremely important position in the national economy and international commerce. The mission of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is therefore even greater. In terms of the national economy, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is both the oldest chamber of commerce established in China and the first new chamber of commerce established in accordance with the new law. It cannot but bear the responsibility of guidance for the world's business community. At present, the problem of maintaining the world's established enterprises, the problem of gradually implementing industrial plans, and the problem of unemployment prevention and unemployment relief cannot be properly resolved without the sincere cooperation between the government and the business community. In terms of international commerce, commercial competition is becoming increasingly fierce. Foreign development cannot be achieved without concerted efforts and collective wisdom, nor can it be achieved by perfunctory actions and procrastination. Today, the executive and supervisory committee members of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce are sworn into office. Xiangxi deeply knows that you are all leaders in various industries. In the future, your planning and implementation will surely live up to expectations. However, I have always observed that the internal organization of important chambers of commerce in countries such as Britain, the United States, Germany, and Japan is extremely sound. Their investigation and statistics on domestic and foreign business conditions are also extremely detailed. Therefore, whether it is maintaining the domestic market or developing the foreign market, they can assist the government in actively implementing fundamental business plans. I especially hope to encourage you all." Zhao finished reading and continued to deliver a personal speech, briefly saying: "Gentlemen, just now Mr. Lu Fengzhu said that he wanted me to give an admonitory speech. The word 'admonitory speech' is of course appropriate for the government's position. I have been friends with you for many years and absolutely cannot give an admonitory speech, but I can only say to your association. However, what the Ministry of Industry and Commerce sent me to say today on behalf of it is not my tone, but the meaning of Minister Kong Yongzhi of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. I have already drafted a manuscript and read it for you just now (see above). The above is the meaning of Minister Kong. I have a few more words to express and contribute to you. Let's look at the domestic situation. This kind of disturbance is nothing more than for the problem of livelihood, the problem of bread, the problem of rice bowls. In short, this problem is the problem of unemployment, which is very related to our commerce. To solve this unemployment problem, first of all, the production industry must be developed. The other day, when the Chamber of Commerce held a meeting of member representatives, I temporarily left the meeting due to business. Please Director Pan Gongzhan represent me. Director Pan's meaning is the same as my suggestion, which is to develop the production industry. But the most important thing at present is that everyone should promote domestic goods. I have heard the four words 'promote domestic goods' many times, but in fact, it has never taken effect. Especially those of us who are a little more noble are desperately using foreign goods. To reverse this trend, we still need our own leadership to enable the whole country</p>
<p>to use domestic goods, so that commerce can succeed and have a solid position. Therefore, developing the production industry starts with using domestic goods ourselves. Now our foreign trade is always heavily in surplus. Japan's total annual surplus is only three million. They already have a consistent idea from top to bottom that all clothing, food, and utensils must be made in their own country. Therefore, our most important task in the future is to promote domestic goods, which is to develop the production industry so that everyone in the country has food to eat. If everyone in the country has food to eat, the country will naturally be peaceful." After Zhao's speech, Shou Yicheng gave a speech, briefly saying: "Last summer, when I represented the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce to attend the International Chamber of Commerce, I conducted a detailed investigation on the organization and business of the chambers of commerce in London, Paris, Berlin, Hamburg, and other cities. I felt that their organization was far more complete than ours. I sought the reason for this, and the soundness of the organization of trade associations and the cooperation between experts, academic groups, and government agencies in various industries is their most powerful source. This time, the unified reorganization of Shanghai business groups has gone through many difficulties, which is probably what it should be in the process of reasonable chamber of commerce organization. However, the common disease of our country's society is often cooperation in name but not in reality. Fortunately, the committee members elected this time are all recommended by various industries and have a reputation for the times. Therefore, there must be full cooperation between the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the government, and between the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations. I respectfully wish your association an immeasurable future development."</p>
<p>Admonitory Speech from the Municipal Party Committee: "Today is the day of the inauguration of all executive and supervisory committee members of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. I feel that the decline of China's international status is largely due to the failure of industry and commerce to prosper. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce occupies a very important position in the national industry and commerce and is the leader of the national merchants. After you take office today, I hope that you will lead the national merchants to revitalize industry and commerce. The mission of our party to complete the Chinese revolution is to have all Chinese people participate in the national revolution and jointly improve China's international status. Some people say that the people of all countries in the world who are oppressed in life are revolutionary, and the people who are not greatly oppressed in life are relatively non-revolutionary. Merchants are economically better than people from other sectors, so they are mostly non-revolutionary. Whether this statement is reasonable or not can be ignored, but Chinese merchants must not be compared with world merchants, because the Chinese nation is an oppressed nation, and Chinese merchants are also oppressed merchants. We must work hard to do the work of lifting oppression and improving China's international status. This is a point that we should pay attention to internationally. At present, the most difficult problem in the country is labor-capital disputes. Our party, whether it is for workers or merchants, wants to enable them to stand on an equal footing, so that our national organization can reach a very sound state. Therefore, we must figure out how to resolve labor-capital disputes in Shanghai so that they will not happen again, and gradually push them to the whole country so that everyone in all sectors of the country can reach an equal position, and then we can realize the national revolution. I think all of you committee members can pay attention to this point today."</p>
<p>Admonitory Speech from the Municipal Government: "Today is the day of the inauguration of the first committee of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. I feel very honored to participate in the grand ceremony. In the past, the old-style Chamber of Commerce started in Shanghai, and today the new-style Chamber of Commerce also starts in Shanghai. The committee members present here are all leaders of the industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai, so this ceremony is a very valuable thing. The Chamber of Commerce is very related to the development of national industry and commerce, because the Chamber of Commerce is a collection of industrial and commercial leaders who can jointly study what should be developed and what should be reformed. Therefore, the development of national industry and commerce relies heavily on the Chamber of Commerce, but the former Chamber of Commerce failed to satisfy this point, because the former Chamber of Commerce was not unified or economical in organization, and the members did not represent industry and commerce, so it did not contribute much to industry and commerce. Some people say that the big problem of Chinese merchants is to talk about commerce in commerce. It seems to the brothers that talking about commerce in commerce is not the problem of Chinese merchants. The problem of Chinese merchants is that they cannot talk about commerce in commerce. In the past, the representatives of the Chamber of Commerce did not represent the interests of the whole, but represented the interests of a certain store or a certain individual. Of course, the organization was not good, but it was also impossible to talk about commerce in commerce, because talking about commerce in commerce is not an easy task. Without sufficient research, it is impossible to talk about it. Now the Chamber of Commerce is organized according to the central regulations, and the representatives are all leaders of various industries who can seek the interests of the whole. I hope that you can earnestly</p>
<p>talk about commerce in commerce in the future and fully study the methods of developing industry and commerce. The current unemployment problem is originally the responsibility of the government, but it cannot be solved without the joint cooperation of the government and merchants. We know that the unemployment problem is not a simple problem. The British government was overthrown because of the unemployment problem. At that time, it was thought that after the Labour Party organized the government, there might be considerable ways, but now this problem still cannot be solved. The situation in our China is certainly not exactly the same. This problem may be easier to solve. At present, the government has organized a committee to study the unemployment problem. Our merchants should pay full attention to it and cooperate with the government to carry it out. There will always be a day to solve this problem. Today, the committee members are certainly very important leaders in the industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai. I very much hope that you will cooperate with the government to seek the development of Chinese commerce and solve the problem of unemployment in China."</p>
<p>Speeches from Guests: (2) Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, delivered a congratulatory speech, saying: "East of the Yangtze River, west of the Pacific Ocean, there is Shanghai. Merchants gather, organizations are friendly, no one can match. Reorganize, unify, lead, and lift the outline. The first title of assuming office is to benefit and eliminate abuses, deeply united. Leading the merchants is the ladder for this. Sincerely dedicate congratulations, and the goods and materials will increase day by day." (2) Yu Qiaqing gave a speech, saying: "Today is the inauguration of all executive and supervisory committee members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. I am very honored to participate in the grand meeting. Now, taking advantage of the presence of all representatives and committee members, I have a few words to say. First, I am not joining the Chamber of Commerce this time because I am old and busy, and I have been doing public affairs in Shanghai for 50 years. In recent years, my spirits have been poor, so I rarely participate in foreign affairs. There are various speculations from the outside world. I would like to explain to you that if there is anything you need me to do in the future, please do not decline. Second, the most painful thing for merchants at present is the problem of gold being expensive and silver being cheap (omitted). All committee members who are sworn into office today are leaders in various industries. I hope that you will pay attention to this issue." After the representatives and guests finished speaking one after another, the chairman gave a reply speech, and a photo session adjourned the meeting.</p>
<p>Election Situation: After the inauguration ceremony, the first executive committee meeting was held on the spot to elect standing committee members and the chairman, and to receive the handover of files from the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee. Ye Huijun was still the temporary chairman. After the rituals, a vote was immediately held to elect the standing committee members. The elected were Xu Jiqing, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Yuan Ludeng, Ye Huijun, and other five people. Then, a vote was held to elect the chairman of the committee. As a result, Xu Jiqing was elected as chairman with eleven votes. After the announcement, Mr. Xu immediately went to the seat to request resignation. All committee members on the spot retained him. Representatives from the Party Committee, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Social Affairs Bureau, etc., repeatedly urged him not to resign. Then, the case of Executive Committee member Zhu Yinjiang's letter of resignation was discussed. It was decided to retain him and send a representative to persuade him. The meeting adjourned after a while.</p>
<p>New Chairman's Statement: After the new chairman, Mr. Xu Jiqing, was elected as chairman, he immediately requested resignation on the spot. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited Mr. Xu at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank yesterday afternoon. According to his conversation, he will definitely not take office as the chairman of this session. He said that in addition to submitting an oral resignation, a written resignation has also been submitted on the spot. No matter what, please the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to elect other capable people. The reporter asked, "What if the Chamber of Commerce does not allow the resignation?" Mr. Xu replied, "I will make further representations." It is also reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, because Chairman Xu does not agree to take office, will send Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaolai, and others to Mr. Xu's residence to earnestly retain him.</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing and others Enjoy a Banquet This Afternoon: Giants of the business community, Yu Qiaqing and Qin Runqing, etc., were very happy that the new chairman and standing committee members have been elected.

<p>Since the division of municipal and county governance rights in this city in July 1928, the collection of land tax by the Municipal Government has not been reported by the Civil Affairs Department, making it impossible to verify.

<h3 id="e123">Requesting Extension for Continued Payment of Winter Grain Tax Arrears <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Letter from Township Chiefs to District Chief: The township chiefs of the first district of Shanghai County presented a letter to the district chief yesterday, stating that they were presenting a request for an extension for continued payment of the 18th year's winter grain tax arrears due to sudden disasters and lack of funds to collect. The letter stated: "We received your letter stating that the County Government's 328th order stated that the Finance Bureau proposed at the 40th county government meeting on the 9th of this month that if the township chiefs have not paid any of the 18th year's winter grain tax arrears, how should they be ordered to be responsible for collecting them? It was decided that the Finance Bureau should first investigate the number of outstanding tickets and distribute them to the township chiefs. At the same time, the county government ordered the township chiefs to collect and submit the 18th year's winter grain tax in full by the end of June, and report the compliance situation for verification without delay. Therefore, we查 eighteen years of winter transport delays have been for a long time, and we should strictly urge payment to maintain the national tax. In addition to the above, the corresponding letter reaches you, hoping that you will investigate and be responsible for urging payment as soon as possible, and collect all payments by the end of June without any further delays. It is of the utmost importance, etc.奉此查 eighteen years of winter transport delays and other times after urging the payment, each flower household Xian Wei Qing and Huang do not meet, and we must wait for the small cooked to come to the city. Unexpectedly, a flood occurred, and the number of small cooked harvests was no more than one-tenth of one-twentieth. It is not enough to make up for the disaster-stricken rice and cotton with the price of small cooked revenue. In short, in the event of consecutive years of poor harvests, people have few cover collections. At a time when people are poor and financially exhausted, it is difficult to complete the payment of this year's people's debts in the shortest possible time. According to rumors, all kinds of complaints are true. Sincerely, Yunjun is long-suffering and embraces compassion and care. I am very concerned about the difficulties in the countryside. I will report the truth to Fu Qi Jun Chang Jianhe and request approval for an extension of the continuation of payment to show consideration for both public and private interests. Sincerely, Wu, the first district chief.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Real Estate Deed Fees Collected According to Regulations <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Deduction of Education Fee Receipt Fee and Collection Fee</p>
<p>Effective July 1st of This Year</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Land Bureau issued real estate deeds in accordance with Article 7 of the Shanghai Special City Real Estate Deed Regulations, charging 5 jiao per sheet. Because the various regulations were not complete at the beginning of the issuance, Article 8 of this regulation stipulates that the original deed tax and surcharges should be paid in accordance with the old regulations until new regulations are in place. Therefore, according to the old regulations, 5 jiao of silver is still collected for each deed, and another 3 jiao for education fees and 1 fen for receipt fees are collected, totaling 8 jiao and 1 fen per sheet. The bureau believes that the rules for the real estate transfer tax are now presented to the municipal government for approval and promulgation, and the municipal expenses collected as an attachment have also been presented for approval to uniformly collect 5%. The deed tax and surcharges referred to in Article 8 of the deed issuance regulations all have new regulations. The 3 jiao for education fees and 1 fen for receipt fees that have always been collected on each deed according to the old regulations should be cancelled. A special request has been made to the municipal government for approval, effective July 1st of this year, to collect 5 jiao of silver per deed according to the regulations. Shanghai County</p>
<h3 id="e125">Budget Review Decision Situation <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government's budget for the 19th year was reviewed at the general meeting on the 30th in the afternoon. The budget for various expenses has been largely decided. Except for the Party affairs expenses, which are still unable to be抵抵, the rest are based on the principle of measuring people as 出, and the results have been obtained. A. Civil Affairs expenses: (1) Public Security expenses are still included in the original budget amount according to local needs, but the municipal allocation is now only allowed to be allocated in half. Before the full allocation is made, it is necessary to temporarily reduce the amount for payment. (2) In addition to the original expenses, the District Office's expenses will be allocated again from the charity and other fees originally listed in the 欵產處. Because Shanghai County currently has no urban charity and other institutions, they have already been handled by various districts. (3) The original plan for the Township Office's expenses was to酌酌 the amount of支配 to facilitate self-sufficiency and implementation. Because the local area is poor and无可无可, and the land tax催催 is assisted by the local 保保. After the local 保保 is abolished, the Township Chief has召召集 the meeting to solve the problem without listing it in the budget. (4) The expenses of the Security Corps are listed according to the revenue and expenditure numbers of the previous year. (5) The income of the original 欵產處 and the积积 are listed in a special book. (6) The county's administrative reserve fund is almost completely absent because there are few local internal affairs and they are allocated to the District Office and the County Agricultural Farm. It is decided to further reorganize the county's housing donation. After the full amount of public security expenses is available, 100 yuan per month will be deposited into the 欵產處 as a reserve fund. Except for the Finance Bureau's expenses, which are paid by the provincial payment, and the expenses of the original 欵產處, which are listed separately, all expenses are not listed. The expenses of the County 欵產處 are listed. Construction expenses: The expenses of the Construction Bureau will be reduced by half according to the newly compiled budget due to the suspension of provincial payments. The survey fee will be discussed when the river dredging funds are available. Education expenses: The busy busy tax and other items are corrected according to the standards proposed by the Finance Bureau. The expenditure items are not changed according to the compilation of the Education Bureau. The reduced amount of revenue is transferred under the reserve fund item to make the revenue and expenditure suitable. Agricultural and commercial expenses: The budget of the county agricultural farm was previously insufficient due to the deadline for keeping the transport. In the 19th year, the provincial subsidies were also suspended, so there was completely no payment. It was decided to allocate 1,000 yuan from the local fees, and 200 yuan originally allocated by the 欵產處, totaling 350 yuan for the farm's agricultural production revenue and expenditure as the farm's expenses. The late payment penalty for land tax will also be allocated as the farm's temporary expenses. The above-mentioned reviews have been completed and will be submitted to the county government meeting this Wednesday (today) for approval before being compiled and submitted in accordance with the budget plan issued by the Finance Department.

<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Association yesterday submitted a petition to the Chairman of the National Government and the President of the Executive Yuan, as well as the Ministers of Interior, Finance, Industry, and Commerce, requesting the strict enforcement of the clothing system regulations and effective restrictions on Western attire. The petition stated that since the promulgation of the regulations, which limit the use of domestically produced robes and gowns, half a year has passed. It was hoped that in the future, the whole country would uniformly comply and implement these regulations, so that the sales of domestically produced silk, cotton, hemp, and woven products could be restored to their former glory, and the industry could rely on this to make rapid progress, giving businesses a chance to survive. However, the reality is far from this. Looking around the market, foreign goods stores are everywhere, and foreign clothing is as prevalent as ever. The domestic silk and cotton weaving industry is declining day by day. Today, the global trend is to promote domestic goods in order to alleviate unemployment and restore production. Examples include the Queen of England personally using domestic products, Japan's strict austerity policies, India's use of indigenous cloth, and Turkey's promotion of domestic goods. There are too many examples to list. Given China's extreme poverty, the whole country should unite in using domestic goods to block loopholes and cultivate the national foundation, so as to resist the economic aggression of the great powers and gradually seek strength. However, the people of the whole country compete to regard wearing foreign clothes as fashionable, and all clothing and food tends towards foreign styles. This is the root cause of financial exhaustion and national weakness. If fundamental and strict prohibitions are not enforced, and compliance with the regulations is not urged, it will be impossible to achieve the effect of changing customs and influencing behavior from above. A few days ago, our association convened an emergency meeting of silk weaving colleagues from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and all unanimously agreed to petition the government to reaffirm the clothing system regulations, effectively restrict Western attire, and issue orders to all levels of government agencies to set an example and take the lead in complying with the regulations, or else be punished for violating the law. If this can be carried out swiftly and resolutely, then the people of the whole country will be proud to wear domestic goods and regard Western attire as disrespectful. In this way, within a few years, not only will the domestic bulk industries be able to restore their original production, but unemployed workers will also be able to be accommodated as much as possible, and the national economy and the livelihood of businesses will be maintained and developed. We earnestly request your departments to take our sincere intentions into consideration and approve our proposal for implementation, so that the national economy and the people's livelihood can truly benefit from it.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Zhang Yaozeng's Views on Foreign Legal Persons <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<h3 id="e128">Mitsui vs. He Hong Case <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The case of Mitsui &amp; Co. v. He Hong et al. was heard for the second time at the Special District Court the day before yesterday. The plaintiff's representative, lawyer Okamoto, and the second defendant's representative, lawyer Zhang Yaozeng, engaged in a major debate on the issue of legal person status. This was reported in the previous newspaper. We interviewed lawyer Zhang to inquire about the intent of his arguments at the time. Mr. Zhang said that the newspaper's report was largely accurate, but there were some omissions, so he elaborated on his views as follows: (1) There is a major principle that must be explained first in refuting the plaintiff's claims, namely the effectiveness of the law. Statutory law is stronger than customary law, and later law prevails over earlier law. This is a theorem in jurisprudence. However, there is considerable debate as to whether laws or treaty laws (i.e., clauses in treaties relating to the rights and obligations of the people in civil matters) are superior. Some people say that treaties cannot directly take effect domestically and must be enacted into law and promulgated separately in accordance with the content of the treaty law before they can take effect domestically. This theory inevitably emphasizes the law. The prevailing view today is that a promulgated treaty has the same effect as a law. A treaty can change a law, and a law can also change a treaty. The effectiveness is still determined by the general rule that later law prevails over earlier law. Therefore, within the existing legal system of a country, the most recently enacted law has the strongest effect. When a court hears a case, it must take the most recently enacted law as the highest standard. All other old customs, old laws, and old treaties that conflict with the most recent law have no basis for assertion. This is indeed a major principle adopted in the legal system of civilized countries. Now, China's recently implemented important laws such as the Civil Code and the Enforcement Rules of the General Principles of the Civil Code are indeed the highest standard laws governing civil affairs. Their effectiveness is higher than all previous civil laws and regulations. However, the plaintiff's lawyer insisted on relying on some old treaties and old customs to resist the application of the most recent laws. Regardless of whether what he relied on was already invalid or inherently illegal, it has no value for consideration. Even if what he relied on had no flaws, according to the major principle that new law prevails over old law, it is obviously untenable. This point is the biggest mistake in the plaintiff's defense. His argument is fundamentally unacceptable precisely because of this. (2) The plaintiff claims that foreigners subject to consular jurisdiction are not subject to Chinese laws and regulations unless otherwise provided for in special treaties. Therefore, the legal person status of a foreign legal person should be determined by the law of its home country. This argument is untenable today. In the past, treaties providing for consular jurisdiction, if they conflicted with the most recent laws, according to the major principle that later law prevails over earlier law, that part of the treaty could not be asserted again in court. This is self-evident. Now, Article 11 of the Enforcement Rules of the General Principles of the Civil Code clearly stipulates that foreign legal persons are not recognized unless otherwise provided for by law. Then, regardless of what treaties existed before, if a foreign legal person claims its personality in a Chinese court, it can only apply the provisions of this Article 11. Unless there is a law or treaty that changes this article in the future, this is a definite and supreme rule. Moreover, the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce has long expired and become invalid. The new treaty has not yet been concluded. It can be said that there is no basis for the Japanese to claim consular jurisdiction. In July 1928, the National Government promulgated Article 4 of the Provisional Measures for the Application of Old Treaties between the Republic of China and Various Foreign Countries before the New Treaties were Concluded, stating that foreigners in China should be subject to the laws of China and the jurisdiction of Chinese courts. Since the new Sino-Japanese treaty has not been concluded, it is naturally subject to its control. However, the plaintiff actually said that the National Government publicly recognized that the Japanese have consular jurisdiction, which is even more contrary to the facts. To go one step further, even when the consular jurisdiction treaties were valid in the past, their effect only extended to cases where foreigners were defendants. Cases where foreigners were plaintiffs were all handled in Chinese courts in accordance with Chinese law. Now, the foreign legal person is the plaintiff, but it invokes consular jurisdiction to say that it should not be subject to Chinese laws and regulations. Such an expansion of consular jurisdiction was unreasonable even in the past, let alone today. As for the plaintiff's citation of several cases to illustrate that Chinese courts have never denied foreign legal persons on the grounds of non-registration, it is even more untenable to say that foreign legal persons do not need to be recognized today. In the past, the Shanghai Mixed Court and the Provisional Court handled the most cases involving foreigners as plaintiffs and Chinese as defendants. It is true that the foreign legal person was not denied, but the Mixed Court was an illegal organization of foreigners after the 1911 Revolution, and the Provisional Court was clearly a temporary measure agreed upon by the local authorities and foreign consuls. It has no legitimate status in Chinese law, needless to say. Other formal courts have no clear precedents for recognizing foreign legal persons, but the Supreme Court has an explicit statement denying all foreign firms as legal persons (Supreme Court Precedent 7, Shangzi, 1158). To go one step further, even if the formal courts had tacitly recognized foreign legal persons in the past, all conflicting practices would naturally become invalid after the implementation of the Civil Code and have no basis for assertion. The plaintiff also said that the current Special District Court's hearing of cases where foreign legal persons are plaintiffs is tantamount to recognizing them as having legal personality by virtue of its authority, which is also a misunderstanding. The court can investigate the existence or lack of the parties' capacity at any time. Regardless of the stage of the litigation, if the court finds that it is lacking, it can order it to be corrected or reject the lawsuit. Therefore, the first instance's failure to discover its lack does not prevent the second and third instances from investigating and correcting it. It cannot be said that the court's acceptance of the case without immediate investigation means that it has recognized its personality. In short, regardless of whether there is consular jurisdiction or not, regardless of past practices, in cases where foreigners are now plaintiffs suing Chinese in the Shanghai Special District Court, according to Article 2 of the New Agreement of the Shanghai Public Concession Court, Chinese laws and regulations, whether substantive or procedural, must be applied uniformly now or in the future. And according to Article 11 of the current Enforcement Rules of the General Principles of the Civil Code, foreign legal persons are not recognized unless otherwise provided for by law. Therefore, Mitsui &amp; Co. has no basis for asserting its legal person status unless it obtains recognition in accordance with Chinese law. (3) The plaintiff also said that even if foreign legal persons are subject to Chinese law, there is no need for foreign legal persons to register according to the current interpretation of the law. This is even more wrong. Article 6 of the Enforcement Rules cited by the plaintiff specifically refers to Chinese public interest legal persons and has nothing to do with foreign for-profit organizations. There is no need to discuss it in depth. Although Article 1 of the Enforcement Rules states that civil matters that occurred before the implementation of the General Principles of the Civil Code are not subject to the provisions of the General Principles of the Civil Code, it clearly states that this is limited to cases where there are no special provisions in the Enforcement Rules. Now, Articles 11 to 15 of the Enforcement Rules, all five articles, are special provisions regarding foreign legal persons. The general purport of these provisions is that foreign legal persons cannot have the same legal capacity unless they follow the same establishment procedures as Chinese legal persons. The intent is very clear. If it is said that there is no need for foreign legal persons to register under the current law, then where will these magnificent major articles be placed? (4) The plaintiff also said that China's laws are incomplete, and it is difficult for foreigners to register even if they want to. This is even more ignorant. Article 11 of the Enforcement Rules stipulates that foreign legal persons are not recognized unless they are established in accordance with the law, and Article 13 of the same article stipulates the method of recognition, that is, foreign legal persons who set up offices in China may apply mutatis mutandis the provisions of the Civil Code regarding the establishment of various legal persons. Mutatis mutandis means that foreign legal persons shall apply the provisions of the Chinese legal persons' establishment and apply them to produce the same legal results. This kind of mutatis mutandis applies to all kinds of legal persons. Now, let's just talk about companies. A company is a kind of for-profit organization. According to Article 45 of the Civil Code, which is applied mutatis mutandis, its qualifications should be determined by special law, and Article 6 of the current Company Regulations, a special law, stipulates that the establishment of a company cannot be asserted against a third party unless it is registered with the competent authority where the head office is located. Then, a foreign legal person who sets up an office in China cannot assert its legal person status against a third party, that is, against persons other than the company, unless it is registered with the competent authority where its office is located. This is very clear. However, the plaintiff said on the one hand that there are no provisions for the registration of foreign legal persons in the Company Regulations. The Enforcement Rules clearly state that mutatis mutandis shall of course be in accordance with the provisions of the Chinese legal persons. Why is there a need for separate provisions? If the Company Law has provisions for foreign legal persons, then it can be applied directly. Why must the Enforcement Rules stipulate it as mutatis mutandis? On the other hand, the plaintiff said that Mitsui &amp; Co. has already registered at its head office in Japan, and no one can contest it. This is even more incomprehensible of the mutatis mutandis. A foreign legal person sets up an office in China, so mutatis mutandis, the provisions of the Chinese company's head office registration are applied, requiring it to register at the location of the office. This is the reason for specifying mutatis mutandis. If one sticks to its words without any changes, it is application. Moreover, if this were the case, the legal provisions for mutatis mutandis would be meaningless. Thirdly, the plaintiff said that a third party refers to a person who has no contractual relationship with the company, which is even more bizarre. Our Article 6 of the Company Regulations was originally based on Article 45 of the Japanese Company Law, and scholars of that law all explain that a third party refers to all persons other than the company's founders and the company. It has never been heard that a person who has a contract with the company is not a third party. I only know that a person who has a contract with an unregistered company can assert that the contract is invalid on the grounds of non-registration. The above are all misinterpretations by the plaintiff. The plaintiff also said that the procedures for legal person registration are incomplete and the court has no registration preparation, which is even more wrong. Article 10 of the Enforcement Rules of the General Principles stipulates that the court is the registration authority, but only for those who register in accordance with the Civil Code, that is, only for the registration of public interest legal persons. As for for-profit legal persons, the Company Registration Rules, which are mutatis mutandis, stipulate it very clearly in Article 34 of the Legal Person Registration Rules. As for registration in accordance with the Company Law, the Provisional Company Registration Rules stipulate it in great detail. It has been implemented for a long time. Foreign companies apply mutatis mutandis the Company Regulations and of course apply mutatis mutandis the Registration Rules. How can it be said that the registration provisions are lacking? In short, our current legal system treats foreign legal persons equally and gives them the same treatment as Chinese legal persons. Any foreign legal person who sets up an office in China, whether it is for public interest or for profit, whether it is a company or a foundation, must obtain the same rights and obligations as Chinese legal persons of the same type as long as they follow the same establishment procedures as Chinese legal persons of the same type. This is the inevitable conclusion based on the systematic interpretation of the Enforcement Rules of the General Principles of the Civil Code, the Company Regulations of the Civil Code, etc. Its spirit is broad and fair, and it is more than any civilized country's laws. The plaintiff uses the incompleteness of Chinese law as an excuse, but I believe that Chinese law is extremely perfect in this respect.</p>

<p>Abolishing Departments and Laying Off Employees The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in order to reorganize its internal affairs and implement austerity policies, announced the implementation of these measures yesterday (July 1). The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Abolishing the Warehouse Department: The company had specially established a Warehouse Department to manage the many docks and warehouses, with Hong Yanbin as the department head. From July 1st, this department will be abolished, and the various docks and warehouses will be directly under the jurisdiction of the head office, without the need for the department head to relay. Hong Yanbin will be reassigned as the accounting director. The general manager will select diligent employees from the other department members and staff, retain seven or eight people, and send them to the various warehouse management offices in the port to assist in warehouse affairs. The rest will be laid off.</p>
<p>Canceling Auditors: The company originally had a department of external auditors who were sent to various ports and ships to investigate affairs. Now, because the company's budget has been established to match income and expenditure, it has no choice but to implement austerity policies. Yesterday, it issued a notice to dismiss all of the more than 20 external auditors.</p>
<p>Establishing an Affairs Department: When the Business Department merged with the Shanghai Bureau last month, the original department head, Wang Ziqian, was transferred to the Affairs Department. Wang began to organize and establish this department yesterday, and its functions are equivalent to those of the General Affairs and Port Affairs Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Establishment of the Nanshi Wharf Management Office <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The case of the Nanshi steamship wharf being taken back and managed by the city has been in preparation for many years. The assets of the various ship companies and wharves have been priced and taken back, and the Port Affairs Bureau has been approved by the municipal government to establish the Nanshi Wharf Management Office to manage it. The office has already found a new building at the mouth of Maojia Lane on the Bund as its office location and has appointed Xu Shipu as the director. The office is divided into four sections: mooring, calculation, collection, and inspection. The various staff members have been separately appointed and officially established on July 1st, beginning to work. All shipping companies have paid sufficient deposits for renting wharf warehouses and bases and have signed contracts separately so that each ship can berth when it arrives at the port. The establishment of the management office is of great importance to the future national sovereignty and economy. It is hoped that it will be thoroughly reorganized so that our country's shipping industry will flourish day by day.</p>

<p>During the European War, the youth of the various schools in the British Province of Qubate gathered students from all over the country to sew clothes and bandages for wounded soldiers and to perform all kinds of consolation duties. Other countries followed suit, and after the armistice, all countries admired the bravery of these youths, so they organized youth departments under the various national Red Cross Societies. More than 40 countries successively initiated and joined, undertaking the exchange of knowledge, communication of emotions, and development of industry and sanitation among the youth of the world to cultivate their nature of universal love and mutual assistance. The Chinese Red Cross Society also passed this case at its third conference, but unfortunately it was suspended due to a brawl and a forcible re-election. Unexpectedly, during this rescue operation in the Longhai War, the students of the Xinmin Society of Liukouji, Shangqiu County, organized a burial team of 30 people, who volunteered to be commanded by the rescue team of the Chinese Red Cross Society and were responsible for the burial work without taking any money, digging pits, burying bones, and clearing grass to find corpses. The Red Cross Society provided them with food to show preferential treatment. After receiving the report, Chairman Wang Peiyuan plans to submit it to the Standing Committee for commendation within the next few days. This can be compared to the students of England in the East and West during the European War.</p>

<p>Zhang sentenced to three years of imprisonment</p>
<p>Lawyer Dong Yu declared not guilty</p>
<p>The case of Zhang Taijie, the general manager of the Sichuan-Lu Company, embezzling huge sums of road funds, involved lawyer Dong Yu. The District Court examined and debated the case together. Yesterday was the date of the verdict. At 12:00 noon, the verdict was announced in the first courtroom. The presiding judge was Shen Bingrong, the head of the Criminal Division, and the associate judges were Wu Zhen and Qian Chengjun. Prosecutor Yang Wenjun and clerk Yu Bi were present. After Zhang Taijie was brought in, Dong Yu also reported to the court. The trial judge first asked Zhang Taijie and Dong Yu for their age and place of origin. Zhang Taijie replied that he was 71 years old and from Sichuan. Dong Yu replied that he was 38 years old and from Wujin. The presiding judge stood up and read the verdict. Zhang Taijie was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for embezzlement in public office. The number of days of detention before the judgment was determined would be offset against the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. Dong Yu was declared not guilty. After the verdict was announced, he said to Zhang Taijie that the part about Dong Yu was what you sued, but repeated examinations showed that there was no evidence and the suspicion was insufficient, so he was declared not guilty. You can appeal the part of your own sentence within ten days after receiving the judgment. Zhang replied that he certainly disagreed. The presiding judge then ordered Zhang Taijie to be returned to custody and Dong Yu to be handed over to his original guarantor. Then the court adjourned.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Branch Will Continue to Operate as Usual</p>
<p>The Da Wan Bao reported that the Pacific Trading Company, one of the oldest foreign firms established in China by the British, had convened a special meeting of shareholders on the 27th of last month by the London head office and decided to liquidate automatically. Director Creek was elected as the liquidator. The company's business has always been good. Even during the unfavorable cotton cloth market in Shanghai last year, it was still able to make a slight profit. This liquidation was due to the fact that two major shareholders had no intention of doing business in China. Today (the 1st), the company officially stated that the Shanghai branch will continue to operate as usual during the liquidation period, and before a satisfactory agreement is reached on whether the company will continue to maintain all or part of its business, the directors in Shanghai will temporarily preside over the liquidation affairs. It is now expected that the company may be reorganized. However, its employees in Shanghai are not willing to comment on this point today. It is also reported that the company has been established in Shanghai for nearly 80 years, and the name of the company in Western languages has been changed four times.

<p>In addition to daily newspapers, advanced countries in the East and West also have weekly newspapers that organize and systematize the news of a week and publish it in a collection so that the trends of contemporary politics and economics will be permanently preserved as historical records. The intention is excellent. In the United Kingdom, there are the Manchester Guardian Weekly and the London Weekly Mail, which have circulations of more than hundreds of thousands and are world-renowned weekly newspapers. Although China's news industry has gradually made progress in recent years, there is still a lack of news weeklies. Now, several like-minded people engaged in the news business have founded the Shanghai Weekly Forum, which will systematically compile the news of each week so that readers can have a clear understanding of the news and the development of the current situation in a week. In addition, there will be illustrated sections with photos, pictures, literature, and interesting works so that readers can increase their interests in many aspects after paying attention to the development of current affairs. The Shanghai Weekly Forum has now been published to the fourth issue, and the content and compilation are both excellent. In addition, the Shanghai Weekly Forum, in order to arouse students' attention to the current situation, is taking advantage of this summer vacation to solicit trial readers so that students can understand the development of the current situation at a very low cost. From July 1st, you only need to send a subscription fee of five jiao dollars to read the newspaper for two months (that is, eight issues), including postage. The company's address is at 8 Nanxin Kang Houses, Sichuan Road, Nanjing Road, Shanghai. Russian Automobile.</p>

Since being hired, Xia has worked diligently for almost a year. Now, the shop owner, Lu Deyou, suddenly dismissed his partner, Xia Xiangguang, on the afternoon before yesterday, at 8:00 PM, because the price of rice has soared to more than 22 yuan per stone, which has greatly affected the business. Xia felt resentful because he had not made any mistakes and was suddenly dismissed, and it was difficult to find a job at this time of high prices. He pleaded with Lu earnestly, asking if he could be allowed to stay until the Mid-Autumn Festival, considering the difficulty of finding a job and not caring about wages, so that he could prepare in advance. Xia's plea was earnest, but Lu ignored it. Xia became furious and, in a fit of anger, grabbed Lu, beat him severely, and knocked him to the ground. As a result, Lu's head, waist, and back were injured. He immediately called the police, and they were both detained at the 6th District Police Station.

<p>Unable to Eradicate Them Immediately; Venereal Disease Testing Should Be Conducted. The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau sent a letter to the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association in the concessions yesterday, stating: "We have repeatedly received complaints from district branches of the municipal party and citizens that there are numerous prostitutes in the concessions, and venereal disease is rampant. The municipal administration organs in the concessions only focus on collecting donations and have never asked about whether prostitutes have venereal disease. Please expedite negotiations to urge them to conduct inspections." Prostitution is inhumane and should be prohibited in principle. Even if it cannot be eradicated immediately, those suffering from venereal disease and other diseases should be absolutely prohibited. We hereby request your association to inform the Bureau of Works to urge the health department to conduct thorough inspections and gradually eliminate prostitution, and to notify the Chinese directors to supervise the implementation in order to prevent infection and maintain humanity. We hope to receive a reply."</p>

<p>The 4th District Headquarters of Zhabei Police brought in a divorce case yesterday. According to the plaintiff, Ye Yongsen, a 24-year-old Suzhou native living at 7 Zhaofeng Lane, Zhongshan Road, is an accountant at a silk factory. Three years ago, he married the defendant, Yuan Caixiang. At that time, her parents also agreed, and her sister, Jin Yuanshi, officiated at the wedding with a bride price of 600 silver dollars. In the beginning, they got along well, but the defendant, although young, was lewd in nature and recently had a lover. She became increasingly estranged from me and we could not grow old together. It would be better to separate early. When questioned, the defendant, Yuan Caixiang, a native of Ningbo, 18 years old this year, stated that she and the plaintiff were not formally married. She was working in a silk factory and he was the accountant. He seduced her and they lived together for two years, and their relationship was still strong. Unexpectedly, in May of this year, when she returned to her hometown with the plaintiff, she learned that he already had a wife who was also five years old. How could she be willing to be a concubine? Therefore, she wanted to divorce him, and the plaintiff actually committed bigamy. The court immediately ordered Yuan's mother, Yuan Chenshi, and her sister, Jin Yuanshi, to be brought to the court. Chenshi stated that her daughter was indeed deceived by the plaintiff. Now that she knew that the plaintiff already had a wife and wanted to divorce, it was right to do so. Moreover, women have freedom of marriage, and she could not interfere. Jin Yuanshi stated that she only knew that her sister and Ye were having an affair, and nothing else. The Director reviewed the statements and believed that the case was related to marital disputes and ordered that it be sent to the court for interrogation.</p>

Linsheng used to study at an elementary school near his home. The summer vacation has recently started, and he is at home. His family is poor and it is difficult to raise tuition fees. The school will start soon, and if he does not collect money in advance, it will be too late. So his grandmother ordered her grandson to go to the Tiesma Road vegetable market on Saturday to ask his uncle for help. Linsheng's uncle was very generous and gave him ten yuan. Linsheng carried the money home and passed by North Xizang Road when he suddenly met Ding Afa from Pudong. Ding Afa saw that Linsheng was young and deceitful, and lured him with sweet words. Linsheng fell into his trap and went to a small inn on Jinlong Street. All expenses were provided by Linsheng. Two days later, after the ten yuan was used up, Ding wrote a note and sent his accomplice to Linsheng's house to tell Zhu Yeshi that her grandson was at a certain place and that if she wanted to take him back, she had to pay a certain amount of money. Zhu was anxious because her grandson was missing. When she received the note, she went to negotiate with Ding and agreed to pay some money to take Linsheng back. After the payment, Ding went to her house to collect the money. Zhu called the police and Ding was arrested at the Xinzha Patrol Room. Yesterday, he was sent to the Special District Local Court.

<p>Leisureland Guides Rider Tai Laiyi. The Leisureland Bicycle Race has been in preparation for several months. In addition to actively building tracks and stands on Haige Road in Shanghai West, an office has also been set up on the third floor of 3 Bowu Yuan Road. Manager Pang Meng and Chinese Manager Chen Shouzhi are enthusiastic promoters of sports. The trainer, Peng Sheng, is also a famous Swedish bicycle expert. There are dozens of trainees in his training center from China, Japan, and Annam, all of whom are very talented. They have been training for several months, and their progress has been rapid. As the opening date at the end of July approaches, 25 more trainees have been recruited, and the president of the association, Bruce, personally went to Paris to hire Tai Laiyi, a world-renowned bicycle expert, as the guiding rider to assist in training. Tai Laiyi arrived in Shanghai last week and has a good reputation in Europe and South America. In 1906, he won the Paris Olinges and Reims competitions. In 1907, he won the Paris Hongfuliansai and France's largest Xuedikai Cup. In 1908, Tai Laiyi went from road racing to track racing and traveled north to Argentina, where he became the South American champion. In 1920, he returned to France and changed from a bicycle rider to a guiding car rider. In the past ten years, countless experts have been trained by him.

<h3 id="e159">Standards for Public and Private Riverbanks, Roads, and Alleys <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Land Bureau believes that the riverbanks, roads, and alleys in the city are complex and intertwined, and it is difficult to distinguish between public and private ownership, which hinders surveying and measurement. Therefore, it has specially formulated standards for public and private riverbanks, roads, and alleys, which are divided into three categories, and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval and announcement. The standards for public and private riverbanks, roads, and alleys in Shanghai are as follows: (1) Public and private riverbanks (a) Riverbanks with a length of more than 500 meters are considered public riverbanks, regardless of whether the riparian owners' deeds record any encroachment on the riverbank. (b) Riverbanks with a length of less than 500 meters are considered private riverbanks if the riparian owners have solid evidence to prove that they are privately owned. However, the land deeds of the riparian owners should still be reviewed to determine whether the area of the land exceeds the area recorded in the deed. Land exceeding the area recorded in the deed should be returned to the public. However, if the riverbank is necessary for irrigation of farmland, it cannot be arbitrarily blocked even if it is privately owned. The Land Bureau should indicate this on the land map. When the riverbank is no longer needed for irrigation in the future, the owner can apply for approval to return it to private farmland. (3) Public and private roads (a) Roads with a width of more than one meter and a length of more than 500 meters are considered public roads, regardless of whether the riparian owners' deeds record any encroachment on the road. (b) Roads with a width of less than one meter and a length of less than 500 meters are considered private roads if the riparian owners have solid evidence to prove that they are privately owned. However, the land deeds of the riparian owners should still be reviewed to determine whether the area of the land exceeds the area recorded in the deed. Land exceeding the area recorded in the deed should be returned to the public. However, if the road is an important thoroughfare for villages and towns, it cannot be arbitrarily blocked even if it is privately owned. The Land Bureau should indicate this on the land map. When the road is no longer needed for traffic in the future, the owner can apply for approval to return it to private use. (3) Public and private alleys Public alleys refer to alleys used by two or more owners. Public alleys used by two owners should be delineated on the land map, but it should be noted that they are for public use and cannot be blocked. Public alleys used by three or more owners should be specially indicated on the land map, but it should be noted that the property rights belong to each household, for example, a certain household has a share of a certain percentage of the total area of the alley and pays taxes according to the share. If three or more households unanimously agree to consider the alley as public land and are unwilling to pay taxes, the tax amount should be removed. On the land map, only the words "public alley" should be noted. If there are changes in property rights in the future, such as the gradual merger of property rights of each owner into one household, the household that merges the property can apply for approval from the Municipal Government to pay the taxes.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Public Utilities Bureau's Letter to Tenants of Yuqing Lane <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Public Utilities Bureau's Letter to Tenants of Yuqing Lane, Zhabei: To the Residents of Yuqing Lane: "Houses in the Chinese Area Should Not Use Water and Electricity from the Concession." The houses in Yuqing Lane are entirely located in the Chinese area and are assigned by the competent authorities to the business area of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. From the perspective of national sovereignty and the authority of government agencies, there is no doubt that they should use water and electricity from the Chinese area. The Electricity Bureau has earnestly negotiated, and all households in the lane are supplied with electricity by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, which collects it from the Shanghai Power Company. The water supply should be handled in the same way. Therefore, this Bureau is doing its best to urge the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to connect the water pipes to Changchun Road for easy access to tap water in the Chinese area. Unexpectedly, the owners are pro-foreign and have repeatedly delayed the process, resulting in no progress. Everyone should know that using water and electricity from the concession not only damages sovereignty but also requires the payment of exorbitant taxes to the concession. If they resist, they will use vicious means such as power and water outages to restrain them. In 1927, the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession cut off the electricity to the lane and forced the collection of police taxes, which is a solid proof. I think the old tenants have not forgotten it. "Reasons Why the Public Utilities Bureau Prevented Foreign Merchants from Stopping Water and Cutting Off Pipes to Install Meters." On March 10, 1930, the Shanghai Water Company requested permission to move the water meters on one side of Changchun Road to the intersection of North Fourth, intending to escape the police authority of China and fulfill its selfish plan of permanent occupation. This Bureau immediately rejected it. Subsequently, the company arbitrarily cut off pipes to install meters, but was prevented by police officers from the Public Security Bureau. Unexpectedly, on the 28th of last month, the Public Works Bureau, without the permission of the Municipal Government, relied on a notice and actually cut off pipes to install meters on the sidewalk of North Sichuan Road on the morning of the 30th. This illegal act cannot be recognized. Therefore, we had to take decisive action. Yesterday, together with the Public Security and Public Works Bureaus, we sent personnel to cut off the water pipes in the lane. On the one hand, considering the need for water during the summer, we instructed the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to open the Taiping tap on Changchun Road and connect the water pipes in the lane to the water pipes in the Chinese area of Changchun Road to continue the water supply. I think the tenants can understand these intentions. "All Tenants Should Act Quickly to Solve the Water Supply Problem Together." Now it has been discovered that the water pipes connected in the lane are small pipes with a diameter of two inches, leading to Qixiu Lane, while the main pipe entering the lane from North Sichuan Road has a diameter of four inches, resulting in slightly weaker water pressure and inconvenience for residents living further away. This is because there was no time to choose carefully at the time of the emergency. This Bureau has now notified the owner to formally request water from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company in order to connect the four-inch diameter main pipe. Therefore, please bear with it for the time being. If you really feel inconvenienced, you may urge the owner to follow the instructions of this Bureau to handle this matter. This matter is related to the vital interests of all tenants, and it is especially important during this hot summer season when the demand for water is high. We sincerely hope that you will act quickly and work together to solve it quickly and satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The labor dispute at the French Water and Electricity Company's engine room has been going on for half a month. Both sides have gone to extremes and have no hope of rapprochement. The following is an exploration of the situation yesterday: Warning to All Workers: The company posted a notice the day before yesterday stating that it would recruit new workers yesterday. The general workers were extremely angry, and the workers' representatives specially convened a temporary meeting yesterday afternoon to warn the workers to strictly abide by discipline, so there was no outrageous action. Few Applicants: After the company issued a notice to recruit new workers yesterday, it sent many people to recruit in the four countryside, such as Caojiadu and Zhoujiaqiao, yesterday morning. However, the new workers did not understand the content at first, so there were more than 20 people who were hired. Later, the union's propaganda team went out in full force to persuade and explain the experience of the capitalists of imperialism to the new workers when they were leaving the factory in the afternoon. The new workers said that they did not know the details. Only eight or nine people went to work in the afternoon, and the rest all dispersed. Some workers who dispersed took copper parts with them when they left the factory because they had not received wages for working for half a day. General Meeting Today: The union, in order to urge the capitalists to awaken and to request the release of the workers who were detained due to misunderstanding, decided to hold a members' meeting at the public gymnasium at 2:00 PM today to discuss how to deal with the situation. The municipal party department has been requested to send personnel to guide the meeting, and the Public Security Bureau has been requested to send police to protect the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Two Notices from the Rice Association <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Two Notices from the Rice Association Reorganization Committee (1) Notice Regarding the matter of informing: This association was ordered by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to handle the assessment of rice industry. The rice delivered will be evenly distributed according to the quantity to the registered rice shops who are required to pay and receive the rice. Although most people comply with the payment and rice collection, there are occasional cases of refusal to receive the rice due to slight discrepancies in the rice sample or slight changes in the rice quality. This shows a lack of understanding of the times. You should know that the evaluation of rice is actually the result of our shops suffering from the pain of cheap dark market prices. The Social Affairs Bureau is considerate of all parties and takes care of the people's food and carefully coordinates the emergency measures for the evaluation of rice. Our colleagues should understand the good intentions of the authorities and sacrifice a little. Since you have registered in advance, you should pay and receive the rice according to the assigned quantity. If there is a slight change or rottenness in the rice quality, you may screen it out and remove the bad ones. After this procedure, the quantity should be reported to this association for compensation. It is counterproductive to refuse to accept it because of this, and it will be even more difficult to do things in the future. May I ask what else can be done after this? Therefore, it is hereby notified that all registered rice shops that have not received the rice should pay and receive the allocated rice within two days. If you do not come to receive the rice after this deadline, your previous registration will be cancelled. This association will no longer accept any requests for rice in the future. Please pay attention to this. (2) To whom it may concern: Recently, due to the soaring price of rice and the posting of low prices in the dark market, rice shops have suffered greatly. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has instructed various rice industry organizations to organize an Evaluation Committee to unload the rice stored on ships under the Zhabei River. The Rice will be evenly distributed by this association. In addition to notifying the handling of the situation in advance, this association will hold a general membership meeting at 2:00 PM on July 3 at the Jiagutang Guild Hall in Danfenglou, Danfeng Street. Please all members attend on time to discuss the progress of the evaluation of rice. This matter concerns the vital interests of our colleagues. Please attend on time and do not give up this opportunity.</p>

<p>Zhao Zuzhang, Director of the Jiangsu Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau, has achieved remarkable results in increasing tax revenue since taking office. He has recently been ordered to be transferred to the Jiangning Branch Bureau. The tasks of the bureau are now temporarily assumed by Guan, Deputy Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Stamp Tax Bureau. Mr. Guan took office at the bureau yesterday (the 1st) morning, performed the ceremony in accordance with regulations, and gave a speech to all staff members, urging them to be honest and law-abiding and to work hard. He also gave earnest guidance to the canvassers, saying that both the national tax and the commercial situation should be taken into consideration by Chinese cigarette factories.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Yesterday's Plenary Executive Committee Meeting <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Reporting on the Petition to Nanjing. The Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Industry, suffering from economic invasion and various inescapable circumstances, specially dispatched representatives to Nanjing to petition for relief, as reported previously. It is now learned that the representatives returned to Shanghai together on the 28th. Fellow industrialists flocked to the station to welcome them and inquire about the situation. It is said that the outcome is quite promising. Yesterday, a plenary executive committee meeting was convened. After the ceremony, Chairman Wu Tingsheng reported on the purpose of the meeting, saying that the delegation to Nanjing, entrusted by fellow industrialists to petition the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Ministry of Finance, was unprecedented in the history of the association and was truly a last resort in the cigarette industry. The exchange rate of gold has never been so high, even doubling compared to the previous year, and although the tax rates were set at the time of the unified tax, the order restricting the sale price was only issued last October. If the government had known about the huge fluctuations in the gold exchange rate at that time, it would not have disregarded the life and death of the Chinese cigarette industry. Now that our fellow industrialists are at the end of their rope, we have no time to lose and have prepared three measures to petition the government to rescue the remaining cigarette factories and consider the livelihoods of tens of thousands of workers. We were unanimously approved by the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The main points of the assistance were seen in the previous report. Finally, we presented the situation to the Ministry of Finance, hoping to obtain practical relief measures. Secretary Li Yunong received us and conducted a detailed investigation into the various difficulties of the cigarette factories regarding raw materials, foreign exchange, taxes, and price limits, as well as the closure of nearly twenty large and small cigarette factories, proving that the manufacturers' capabilities were exhausted and that immediate relief was necessary. Secretary Wang expressed understanding and was concerned about economic invasion. He inquired about the flower purchasing situation of Chinese and foreign cigarette merchants. We replied that Chinese merchants had weak capital and could only buy in small quantities, making it difficult to gain the trust of the authorities. Secretary Li promised to actively seek ways to alleviate the hidden pain of Chinese merchants. We felt satisfied and returned to Shanghai. The petition mission can be considered complete. All our fellow industrialists must continue to work hard. Next, Economic Standing Committee member Shen Liangde reported on the income and expenditure and uses of the petition. Next, resolutions were made on matters related to the follow-up of the petition: (1) If this petition does not have a satisfactory effect, what should be done? It was resolved that at this critical juncture, a more advanced petition must be made. (2) It was recommended that Xia Juchuan, Dai Gengxin, and Lao Jingxiu negotiate with important figures in the banking industry in this city (omitted below). The resolution was passed. (3) The party and government organs in this city have made efforts after accepting the petition of this association. How should we express our gratitude? It was resolved to respectfully express our gratitude and request continued promotion, and Yu Yuqin, Li Xuedong, Wang Qiuquan, Jiang Pinyu, and Bao Gengsheng were appointed to take charge. (4) Inquire about how the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce is expressing its support for the petition of this association. It was resolved to send Shen Liangde and Lao Jingxiu to inquire. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>

<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society recently received reports from Zhang Pengzhu, Magistrate of Siyang County, Jiangsu Province; Chen Jianzheng, Mayor of Jinsuo Town; Chen Tingju, District Chief of the Third District; Zhou Yuankai, President of the Qingjiang Branch of the Chinese Jisheng Society; and Li Xilin, Vice President of the same, stating that the town of Siyang is located in a strategic, densely populated, and low-lying area, and its people suffer from poverty. The third district in the west of Siyang is the worst. The third district borders Hongze Lake and is connected to Si County, Anhui Province and Suqian County, Jiangsu Province. Banditry is rampant. The Jinsuo Town relies on it as a barrier, and the people are living in peace. Jinsuo Town is a commercial hub with dense population, and it is an important town in the west of Siyang and a security for Anhui-Si and Su-Si-Suqian counties. Last winter, bandits such as Wei Yisan first occupied Lujiawei in Siyang, and then occupied the villages along the border of the Siyang-Suqian-Si counties such as Tujia Garden, Suqian Zhatang Town. Although they have been harmed, Jinsuo Town has stood still, and the bandits have not dared to break through. On April 20th of this year, bandits Wei Yisan suddenly led a party of thousands of people to surround and attack the town. Liu Bingquan, an instructor of the town's security group, supervised the group members and the public to resist to the death. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the county chief of Siyang and the county chief of Suqian each led the public security team of Siyang and Suqian counties and the public security team of Su-Su-Shu counties to rush to support them. However, the town was finally captured by the bandits, killing more than 300 men and women, injuring and kidnapping more than the number of deaths. More than half of the houses were burned, more than 700 households and thousands of houses, and the entire town was looted. No household was spared. The corpses piled up like mountains, and blood flowed like rivers. The town became an unprecedented disaster. People were steamed in pots and used to feed pigs. People were cut into pieces with knives and cooked. It was better to be bombed to death with guns and leave bones. The whole town was smelly and steamed for miles. The disaster was more fierce than floods and beasts. The military, police and compatriots saw it together. Since the fall of Jinsuo Town, the fortress of Siyang, Siyang and Suqian counties has been lost, and bandits have been rampant and ravaging an area nearly 100 miles wide. The soldiers came and the bandits went, and the disaster was unprecedented. Now, the dead in the town have no coffins to bury, the injured have no medicine to heal, the kidnapped have no strength to rescue, and the burned have no houses to live in. We have seen the hearts of the people are hurt, and the relief is inadequate. Dare to imitate the cry of the Qin Court and the call of the uncle, ask for the transfer of relief funds to help the orphans and widows. I can't bear to urgently lead and wait for orders. The association should take the disaster situation in the town as urgent and the relief should be expedited. However, the strength is too weak to win the rescue, and it has been requested to jointly organize the Jiangsu Yizhen Association to rescue the dying disaster victims in case of one. Such natural disasters and bandit disasters are becoming more and more intense, and the rescue is not enough. It is truly an unprecedented catastrophe.</p>

<p>Fire at Deyuanxiang Shoe Store - Heavy losses. At around 1:00 AM this morning, a fire broke out at Xinxinqiao intersection on Dama Road in the French Concession. The fire spread and was gradually extinguished at 2:30 AM this morning. The reporter of this newspaper went to the scene to investigate and found that the fire started on the upper floor of the Deyuanxiang Shoe Store. Deyuanxiang Shoe Store is a double-fronted store with house numbers 545 and 543. The boss, Zhu Fengshan, is from Wuxi, is in his 40s, and has more than a dozen employees. The upper floor is rented to the Far East Hotel for business. At around 1:00 AM this morning, the fire suddenly broke out on the upper floor. Everyone was asleep in the middle of the night and was awakened in shock. Fortunately, no one was injured. The facade of Wantai Leg Restaurant at No. 541 on the east side was also affected, and the Tengfang Tea Food Store on the west side suffered minor losses. Deyuanxiang Shoe Store was originally located at the intersection of Gongguan Road, Dongxinqiao. Due to the renovation of the building, it moved to its current location on the 18th of last month. It has not been open for long when it suddenly suffered a fire. All the goods were burned, which is also very unfortunate. The boss, Zhu, fled in fear of crime when the fire broke out. He was captured by the French Concession police detectives, and some employees are being closely investigated.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Letter from the Western Paint Association to Fellow Industrialists to Merge into the Association <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Western Paint Industry Association has been formally established. All former paint industry members affiliated with the Shanghai Foreign Goods Commercial Association are no longer a legal organization. The association sent a letter to the paint industry members yesterday, stating that the association was established under the guidance of the relevant authorities in accordance with the Industrial and Commercial Association Law and the Industrial and Commercial Association Organization Procedures promulgated by Instruction No. 734 of the National Government. The association stated that the members of the paint industry affiliated with the association, such as Gonghe and more than a dozen others, had a narrow organizational view based on free will at the time. It seems that they were temporarily waiting for the transfer of appropriate organizations. Although the organization is not based on laws and regulations and party guidance, the purpose, foundation, and ties to the association, the correction of business operations, and the maintenance and promotion of the common interests of the industry must be the same. The association has been formally established and should be integrated into the association in accordance with the law to create a unified whole, merge water and milk, gather healthy and complete unity, and jointly plan for the welfare of the industry and the advancement of the future. The association believes that the paint industry members in the association must also have this kind of expectation, and anyone with a little knowledge will not have a contrary opinion. On the 17th of this month, the association held a general meeting to elect the first executive committee and had previously sent a letter urging the submission of a member list to re-elect the government. However, the association has not replied, giving up its voting rights, which is regrettable. In order to implement Article 5 of the Industrial and Commercial Association Law, the association sincerely and earnestly makes a final recommendation in this spirit. It is hoped that the association will compile a list of all the affiliated paint industry members and transfer them to the association in order to comply with laws and regulations and strengthen the system. The association hopes to hear back from the association.</p>

<h3 id="e178">A Record of the China Youth Asia Walking Group <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Departure Zhao Dingming At 10:00 am on June 28th, 19th year of the Republic of China, the China Youth Asia Walking Group departed from the North Railway Station in Shanghai, the national cultural center. Before the departure, I was able to participate in the farewell in my busy schedule. I can't express the joy in my heart. When I arrived at the railway station, I saw men and women coming and going on the platform. The most striking things were the flags of the Yousheng Travel Group and the flags presented to the Asian Walking Group by the Camel Travel Team Yuehua Orchestra. Mr. Huang Jingwan vigorously presented the group with "Cherish the reputation of the group, respect public resolutions, visit and take notes everywhere, be considerate of the physical and mental health of female friends, get enough sleep at night, pay attention to cold and heat, pay attention to the suffering of the people, maintain the peace of the whole body, awaken the patriotism of overseas Chinese, and often send good news to the Shanghai newspaper." Photographers such as Guo Xiqilin, Xu Jinzhi, and Shao Woyun competed to take pictures. Speaking of the members of each group, they all wore white copper basin hats, yellow cloth boy scout uniforms, yellow leg bands, and black leather shoes, which were very neat and energetic in appearance. At this time, it was only 9:00 clock. The female members of the group, Hu Sujuan and Cui Xiaogiong, were very calm and paced back and forth. Qiu Fang was very interested and the photographers took pictures of her beautiful figure one after another. At 10:00 am, the photographers officially took several group photos of them on the railway platform and took several photos with the relatives and friends who were seeing them off. Then came Mr. Huang Jingwan's message and the reply from Huang Yue, the group's social worker. The general idea of the reply was that they had been preparing for a long time and were finally able to set off today. They were striving for the glory of our nation and promoting the spirit of youth adventure, as well as the plan to investigate the lives of our nation, which began to be implemented today. They would infuse this matter with a spirit of perseverance and all their strength, and their footprints would travel all over Asia. After speaking, they asked the stationmaster and the chief of transportation to sign to confirm the group before they departed in an orderly manner along the railway track. Everyone shouted "Long live the Chinese nation" and "Success to the walking group" and set off the firecrackers bought by Mr. Huang. For a time, the crackling sound and the enthusiastic atmosphere of representatives from various schools and agencies raising their hats and waving handkerchiefs were tense at the station.</p>

<p>After a week of touring Hong Kong, I took the Chinese steamer Quanzhou to Macau. The voyage was extremely fast, departing at 2:00 pm and arriving at 5:30 pm. I stayed at the President Hotel, which had halls named after Sun Yat-sen, Yuan Shikai, Huang Xing, and Feng Guozhang. The streets in the city were called New Road and Seashore Road. Apart from smoking, gambling, and prostitution, there was no legitimate business in the city. Those who could be called industrialists were the electrical plant, salt, and fishing companies. There were more than 700 fishing boats on the coast, and each time they went to sea, they had to store enough salt because the salt particles in Annam were too large and not suitable for pickling fish. It was necessary to crush the salt by hand, which was clumsy and laborious. The Yu Wuhe Refined Salt Company had a self-made crushing machine and should allow me to donate one to my friend in order to increase the production rate. However, Mr. Zheng still earnestly consulted me about the sales of domestic salt. The patriotism of the overseas Chinese is truly admirable. Macau was originally a corner of Zhongshan County and was leased to Portugal. Surprisingly, it built fortresses and moored three warships in the sea, which were small and old. It had a governor and various judicial and administrative halls. The total number of officials, including the national shipyard, barracks, and ship captains, was no less than thirty or forty, which was more than the merchants in the country. There were car companies that could reach Qiguan in Zhongshan County. There were various gambling casinos, including Shampiao shops, Piao Baige Piao, and Baoju. They were also called companies and numbered more than ten. The annual gambling tax was more than one million. Opium was established with a special sales bureau. There were two or thirty brothels. The opium dens were called talking rooms. There were five cinemas showing domestic films. When Che Chi was released, the seats were full. The schools were still lecturing on scriptures, and there were even more private schools. There were Confucius respect associations and Confucius education associations, and the Confucius birthday was exceptionally lively. Even shops had to hang lights to celebrate. Kowloon was a leased territory of Hong Kong, and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Station was located there. Public buses were used for transportation in the city to Kowloon City, Yau Ma Tei, Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok, Yang Shui Po, Lai Chi Kok, To Kwa Wan, Tai Wan, etc. The largest hotel was the Peninsula Hotel, which cost 1.5 million gold to build. There were also seven or eight cinemas, about half of which showed domestic films. There were six ferries between Kowloon and Hong Kong, which departed as soon as they arrived and had good order. The fare for first class was one dime and the fare for third class was five cents. Hong Kong Island was narrow and densely populated, and the rent for housing was surprisingly high (one and a half times higher than Shanghai). Therefore, Kowloon has become a factory and residential area. The gold was expensive and the silver was cheap, not only was the domestic panic, but the panic of using silver in Hong Kong was the same. The Hong Kong government held meetings for several days, convening non-official members to discuss the matter repeatedly. According to the British merchants' proposal, the government changed to the imaginary gold standard. The Chinese merchants believed that Hong Kong's trade should still use silver currency because China's standard used silver. Finally, it was resolved to prohibit the import of Mexican silver dollars and only allow each person to carry fifty yuan in order to avoid the flooding of silver coins in the market. In addition, public officials were affected by the decline in silver and it was resolved to increase their living expenses by 20%. This increase in expenses would be compensated for by increasing taxes on tobacco and alcohol.</p>

<p>Benli promotes the art of Go. News from the Shanghai-Hankou Go community has already been recorded. What about Beijing? It is also worth recording. People in Beijing like to gamble, but Go is not strong in general society. In the entire city, there is no formal research organization. Only two teahouses near the Confucius Temple have set aside some seats to serve as Go markets. The situation is similar to that of the Zhongxin Building in Shanghai, but the seat is dirty and noisy, even worse than the Zhongxin Building. One teahouse is called Shiyinyuan and the other is called Wencai Teahouse. Quite a few people rely on it to make a living. People in Beijing generally call them Go Hun. Occasionally, one or two connoisseurs go to watch, and these people will try their best to play Go with them, slightly preparing small prizes to win a little money. The scene is very pitiful. A gentleman once initiated and raised funds to set up a Go club on the banks of the Qinhuai River, imitating the example of billiard rooms, with the players paying rent and carefully arranging the seating and furnishings to make it exquisite and spacious, so that the players could devote more effort to this art in a comfortable environment. Later, I don't know how this plan ended up failing, and the municipal authorities did not pay attention to it. The public tea garden run by the municipal government originally had a variety of Go and Chinese chess, but recently it has gradually decreased and only one set of Go remains for guests. There is also a Chinese chess market in the old Pan Palace of the Confucius Temple, which is even more crude. In addition, there is also a Chinese chess market nearby.</p>

<p>When the tour concludes, I trust that everyone's understanding and sympathy towards our nation will deepen. This isn't just about our artistic success, but also about the kindness of your people in understanding the purpose of our tour. In a broader sense, our visit is to contribute our small efforts to the progress of civilized humanity. My most sincere hope for peace, as historically proven, cannot be achieved through military might. The peace that humanity desires isn't merely the calm after a storm. True peace comes from enhancing human development and growth in spirit, intellect, and material well-being. To maintain genuine world peace, humanity must understand, forgive, and sympathize with each other, supporting each other rather than engaging in conflict. The peace that our two great nations, China and America, hope for is based on international trust and goodwill. To achieve this goal, everyone needs concrete research in the arts and sciences, understanding each other's customs, historical backgrounds, problems, and difficulties. I, Lanfang, came here to study the dramatic arts of your country and have benefited greatly from the kindness of your people. My performances of ancient Chinese dramatic art are far from perfect, and I am humbled by your praise. However, I know that your actions are not just an award for my personal skills, but an expression of sympathy for Chinese culture and friendship with the Chinese people. Only in this way dare I accept such great honor. In the future, I will work even harder to be worthy of being part of the Pomona College family, to live up to everyone's recognition." Mr. Mei Qiju then repeated this in English. After the speech, applause thundered for several minutes. Immediately, the American national anthem was played, and the students in academic gowns sang the anthem while standing. After the ceremony, all the doctors came to shake hands and offer congratulations. The president and other officials present said that Mr. Mei's speech was exceptionally profound and immediately requested the full text to be printed and distributed to the students for permanent preservation. Then, everyone took photos together, and another photo was taken with the president. Afterwards, the president specially invited Mr. Mei and the others to a dinner party with over thirty tables and more than ten people in the college dining hall. I, Mr. Mei, and our colleagues sat at two tables, with the president's family, Dr. Dengqin's family, and several professors. The remaining three hundred or so students were also present, sharing the meal to show intimacy. As the meal was about to end, students from the music group stood up and sang twice to show respect, and then moved to Mr. Mei's seat to sing, especially to express goodwill. After the meal, the president led a tour of the dormitories and other places. It was already eight o'clock, so we took our leave and returned. Mr. Mei, Dr. Xu Zhang, and I rode in the same car. Along the way, the flowers and trees were lush, especially the many citrus trees with buds full of branches, exceptionally beautiful. The next day, all the newspapers competed to report the story in detail.</p>
<p>There is a force that is more widespread than Weiqi (Go), but its lack of organization and research spirit is far inferior to Weiqi. I secretly believe that both Weiqi and Xiangqi (Chinese chess) are national Chinese games, but because those in authority do not know how to promote them, these great arts have been reduced to gambling tools. It is a pity. As the Beijing Municipal authorities have recently held many pinball and table tennis competitions, their purpose is nothing more than to promote noble entertainment for the public. I sincerely hope that the authorities can hold a Weiqi competition again in the near future.</p>

<p>French Autumn Salon (3) My Journey of Submitting Works (Part 1) Haisu, your energy is admirable, and I often worry about you because you have too many and too heavy "non-artistic" responsibilities at home. Some with weaker constitutions might have been crushed long ago, but you are still so free and vigorous, which truly makes me happy. However, fatigue is ultimately not a tonic for artists. Haisu, you have the power, and you have already reached the shore of art. You must make up your mind, tighten your belt, and run deeper. There, you can find greater companions: Van Gogh, Titian, Cézanne.</p>
<p>This is a passage from a letter my friend Xu Zhimo sent me from Beijing on September 3, fifteen years ago. Zhimo was one of my most ardent supporters, and I was well aware of this, so I had been preparing to leave the country several times. Who would be willing to submit to the base and turbid ground, wasting limited time? In the spring of fifteen years, I decided to come to Europe, and all the procedures were prepared. Suddenly, like a bolt from the blue, Sun Chuanfang strictly prohibited "models," so I had to argue with him. He gained strength and intensified his oppression, but I could not give in to him. After arguing for a year, I was finally able to set sail across the sea the year before last.</p>
<p>After arriving in Europe, my first natural thought was to seek some knowledge for myself. I was determined to bury myself in hard work for a few years and decided not to care about anything else, focusing solely on painting. Second, because the trends of modern art were constantly changing and surging every day, but in this flow, the surging was always a fierce advance towards the world desired by the self. Recently, with France as the center, the world's artistic trends were establishing a unique spirit of modernity with the courage to negate everything and the ardent hope to establish the self. In this turbulent vortex, I also wanted to muster my courage, establish my ardent hope, and present my works to the artistic center of the world, Paris. Therefore, I planned to hold a solo exhibition in Paris next spring. Before holding a solo exhibition, I originally did not want to submit works to any exhibition.</p>
<p>In late September 1929, we returned to France from Geneva for the first time, passing by the Faculty of Arts Hotel across from the University of Paris. One morning, on a clear and bright day, I was on the third floor of the Faculty of Arts Hotel, looking down at the pedestrians on the street from the window when:</p>
<p>"Hey, Mr. Liu, the Autumn Salon is about to open!" Liu Kangjun walked in and shouted loudly.</p>
<p>"It's still early. It will have to wait another month or two," I said, calculating, and answered him lazily and frankly. Then, Chen Renhao and Fu Nu'an also walked in. Mr. Chen also looked like he was reporting a major event and said,</p>
<p>"This morning, we got a few copies of the submission regulations for the Autumn Salon from Academie Colarossi. We all want to submit works. We hope Mr. Liu will also submit works. Are you willing?"</p>
<p>I thought this was indeed a major event.</p>
<p>"Of course, I am willing to accompany you, but I want to hold a solo exhibition."</p>
<p>I thought and said this at the same time.</p>
<p>"The Autumn Salon is against the official Salon. It is a fresh and progressive Salon, very suitable for your spirit. Before you hold a solo exhibition, you might as well submit once," Mr. Fu also encouraged me in this way.</p>
<p>"That's fine. I'll just take an old work and try it out because my new works are all stored in the countryside, and it would be too troublesome to unpack them for a while. And I also want to use a pseudonym," I replied, meaning that I still did not want to casually submit new works to any Salon in the first place.</p>
<p>"Great, then let's go and select some works."</p>
<p>"We should send them in these few days. The deadline for submissions is September 30," Mr. Fu said, looking at the Salon's regulations.</p>

<p>Yesterday, banks routinely closed their doors for the mid-year settlement, so news was scarce. The money market was slightly active, with the interest rate at 7.2375 cents in the morning, slightly lower by half a cent from the previous afternoon. The afternoon market was slightly better at 7.23875 cents. The silver loan market was even more relaxed, opening at 8 cents in the morning and falling slightly to 6 cents in the afternoon. In the foreign exchange transaction market, remittances in the morning totaled 450,000, and in the afternoon, 500,300. Banknotes totaled 25,000 in the morning and 49,000 in the afternoon. Off-market banknotes totaled 87,000 in the morning and 65,000 in the afternoon. The total volume of silver dollars in the market was about 100,000 or so. The origin of the funds is unknown, but the amount of imports was limited to several hundred thousand.

<h3 id="e184">Silver Loan Amount for June <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The amount of silver loans traded each day in June varied greatly. The fluctuations were particularly intense, reaching a high of 6 cents and a low of only 4 cents, a difference of 15%, which can be described as a drastic change in the market. As such, the total daily amount of silver loans was higher than in the previous month. Fortunately, the second half of the month eased, so the total amount for the month was only 5 taels, 3 mace, 4 fen. Adding June 1, which was the Summer Solstice holiday, with 2 mace, the total would be 5 taels, 5 mace, 4 fen. The daily average would be 1 mace, 8 fen, 4 li, 6.7 hao. If the trend in the second half of the month was as expensive as the first half of the month, the statistical amount would be at least above 10 taels. Based on observations, it is expected that today's meeting will propose a deposit interest rate case, generally set at 5 taels and a 95% discount, which is a record high for this year.</p>

<p>Jardine Mill Reportedly Suspends Night Work... Other Mills Also Reduce Work Hours, Yarn Market Strengthens</p>
<p>Jardine Textile Mill is rumored to be suspending night work, and other mills are also reducing work hours. As a result, people are agitated, and sellers are covering their positions, leading to a tighter market. However, overseas cotton markets remain sluggish. Only third-grade yarns have rebounded by 3-4 yuan. Sales to the Ningbo and Hankou guilds are still relatively active, so the situation is relatively stable. However, there are still over 22,000 bales of yarn in warehouses, including 12,000-13,000 bales of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd yarn. In short, the global cotton industry is in decline, but the yarn market is still changing.</p>
<p>Maoki's Intake is Considerable, Yu Da's Output is the Largest</p>
<p>The market opened before the official bidding with the rumor that yarn mills in the commercial district were reducing work, the selling pressure was weak, and the buying interest was strong, leading to a tighter market. In the third trading session, the third-grade yarn rebounded by 2-3 yuan, and the market became even tighter. Prices for all months rose by 0.0476, 0.08, and 0.09 yuan to 0.12 yuan. In the afternoon, it was reported that there was still good demand for spot yarn, and the market became more active. Prices for all months rose again by 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, and 0.09 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 22,000 bales. The sellers were Dafu, Jifeng, Heshen, Shenji, Yu Da, Daji, Fuhe, Tianchang, and Tianlong, ranging from 500 to 3,300 bales. The buyers were Maoki, Hengde, Lichang, and Xiesheng, ranging from 550 to 2,050 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>International Cotton Prices Decline... Rumors of Factory Work Reductions Abound</p>
<p>Indian Cotton Sold at a Discount... Exchange Rate Continues to Rise</p>
<p>The cotton market is extremely weak. Overseas cotton markets continue to decline, and the situation is very bad. In addition, there are rumors of cotton mill work reductions, so people remain pessimistic, and the market is sluggish. Foreign merchants are extremely accommodating to Indian cotton, and prices are willing to move lower. In addition, the exchange rate is rising, so the current situation in the cotton market is relatively weak.</p>
<p>December Hankou Standard Rises</p>
<p>The Hankou standard market opened with all foreign cotton prices declining. Market sentiment was very tired, and prices fell by 0.02 yuan. Later, due to profit-takers covering their positions, prices rose slightly. As a result, prices fell by 0.005 to 0.015 yuan.

<h3 id="e189">On Japan's Capital Export <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Propose Moving Factories to China and India</p>
<p>Recent Aggression Policy</p>
<p>Due to various factors, Japanese cotton mills' exports are sluggish, and domestic demand is also sluggish, leading to a state of poverty. Reducing work, reducing capital, or reducing workers seems to be the only strategy for manufacturers. However, considering the example of Kanebo, they must be careful. Therefore, overseas development is an inevitable trend. According to Japanese newspapers, in this environment, the so-called "capital export theory" is gradually gaining attention in Japan. If our Chinese factories are oppressed by foreign factories in the future, it will be even worse than it is today. The translation of their remarks is as follows: In addition to maintaining the existing markets in India and China, it is indeed advisable for the Japanese textile industry to seek new ways to exploit resources in those two countries. To this end, it should be determined to export capital instead of products. In the current situation, moving the spindles remaining from the reduction of work in Japanese domestic factories to China should be the first step in the plan for China. However, considering the current situation in China, the degree of need is still too early. However, from a favorable perspective, the production cost in China, with its low labor costs, working hours, and taxes, is about half that of Japan. Although China is frequently in internal strife, transportation is inconvenient, people's livelihoods are haggard, and goods are blocked, these are temporary phenomena. If domestic stability increases the need, the current Japanese goods in China will not be enough to supply the needs. After the establishment of the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement, the current 75% ad valorem tax on yarn and cloth will not be affected. If the new national tariff regulations are implemented, the tariff on cotton textiles may be collected within a range of 125. The impact on the annual export of over 186 million yuan (last year's statistics) to China will be enormous. Therefore, investing in enterprises in China is the trend in the future. In addition to investing in China, India can also be invested in and operated in the same way. Because India is increasing tariffs, Japan is hit hard. If the policy is not changed, the export route will be blocked. Financial and textile companies are already conducting surveys. This kind of news is most worthy of our attention.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Food River Measurement Stopped Again <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the river, rice boats turned back from Huangdu on the fifth. It was reported that this batch had been delayed while watching the situation in Shanghai. Currently, there are more than 20 boats in the river. Because the rice shops delayed in collecting the rice, the appraisal bureau had advanced a large amount of money for the rice measurement in recent days. Therefore, it had to stop the measurement. Once the goods have been measured, the merchants must settle the account and take the money back to their villages. However, the rice shops, firstly, must bring the money when they go to the bureau to collect the white rice, so the smaller shops inevitably feel a little financial difficulty, and thus delay in collecting and transporting the rice (previously, the rice shops settled accounts at the end of each month, but now they are all paid in cash). Secondly, the rice measured by the appraisal bureau naturally varies in quality, so the shops inevitably choose. However, there is a distinction between those who collect first and those who collect later, and those who arrive later do not seem very satisfied. Therefore, they are watching again. However, the appraisal bureau's advances are limited, and once there is a delay, it is difficult to maintain, so it has to be temporarily suspended. The price of Yang Du Jian tends to soften due to the weakness of foreign rice, and both the arrival of goods and sales are sluggish. All transactions are rare.</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign rice continued to weaken because there were many arrivals in recent days. There were still 200,000 to 300,000 arriving on the day. Most domestic merchants in the street have stopped, and foreign merchants are also watching, causing the price to double down by a corner and a half. Yesterday, the market opened at less than 10,000.

<p>North Sales Become Active</p>
<p>Afternoon Rebound</p>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday, the market in various months once showed a sign of fatigue. Because foreign wheat quotations were also 0.04 to 0.05 yuan lower, coupled with the uncorrected downward trend of the previous month, the market sentiment suddenly became weak. The lowest price in this month was 0.02485 yuan, and September was 0.0249 yuan, which was 0.02 to 0.03 yuan lower than the previous month's closing price. However, since then, each market has gradually opened and improved due to more floating and disputes. The factory has not moved, so the market sentiment has gradually improved. When the afternoon market opened, it was still calm at first. Then, because the rice price in the interior was so high, the purchasing power remained unabated, and the northern merchants also showed some activity. The opening price for each month became stronger again. As a result, this month's closing price was 0.0075 yuan better than the previous day, August was 0.0075 yuan better, September was 0.0025 yuan better, October was 0.0075 yuan better, and November was 0.005 yuan better. The opening price for December was 0.02535 yuan, and there was no change afterwards.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Term Wheat Morning Decline Afternoon Rise <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Spot Trading Opened 6,400 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, after the term wheat market opened, it was rumored that small factories unanimously decided not to purchase wheat from the exchange due to the high wheat price and increased costs. The lowest price for this month was 0.0481 yuan due to the low price of foreign wheat. However, the price of each remote month was fixed due to the scarcity of sellers, and there was no sharp decline. Therefore, each market then saw a rebound. When the afternoon market opened, the flour market was tired and recovered, and the interior merchants' purchasing power remained unabated, causing the remote and near markets to improve again. Although actual sales will not rise and will be hit hard, the rice price is not cheap, so there is less hope for a decline. As a result, this month remained unchanged, August was 0.0025 yuan lower than the previous day, September was 0.002 yuan better, October was 0.0025 yuan lower, November was 0.0004 yuan better, and December opened at 0.0513 yuan and closed at 0.0518 yuan, which was 0.0005 yuan better. Because customers' thoughts on the spot wheat are quite firm and they are unwilling to sell cheaply, there is not much difference in the opening price for each grade. A total of 6,400 bags of wheat from Yaowan, Longtan, Shashi, Gaoyou, Zhenjiang, Baoying, Huangqiao, Nanjing, Dongtai, Yangzhou, Mingguang, and Liuhe were purchased by Fuxin, Fufeng, Shenda, and Xinda.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Jiashan Summer Silkworms Generally Unfavorable <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Because farmers in the four rural villages of Jiaxing had a poor spring cocoon harvest this year, they all raised summer silkworms. The amount raised was not weak. However, the climate was bad. At first, it was extremely cold, then there were strong winds, thunder, and rain, and finally, it was hot and humid, so the silkworm larvae were greatly affected. Most of them were found to have died of stiffness. Currently, the early silkworms are already in the major sleeping stage to open their leaves, and the late gang is also about to enter the sleeping stage. The summer cocoon harvest this year will still be reduced.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Dantu New Summer Cocoons Poor Harvest <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Totaling Up To Four-Tenths of the Harvest</p>
<p>Because the government and silk merchants promoted the raising of summer cocoons and issued silkworm eggs, the amount raised by farmers in the towns and villages of Dantu County this year was very smooth. Unfortunately, the weather was very cold and rainy at first, followed by hot and humid thunderstorms, causing the silkworm larvae to change before and after the major sleep. Although they tried to take care of them, 50% to 60% of them were lost to white stiffness and yellow discharge. The new cocoons have already been launched on the market. The total cocoon production in the four rural villages totaled four-tenths of the harvest. The age-old cocoon firms opened their scales yesterday. The initial price of cocoons was 50 to 55 yuan. The high-quality cocoons were priced as high as 60 yuan.</p>

However, both the Road Zhuang and Tu Zhuang Needle Eyebrow green tea, Tianxiang, Fushi, Jinlong, Xiehe, and other firms began to actively search for and transact business, which was slightly smoother. The most important Zhenmei has remained sluggish. According to rumors from the English merchants, there are still more than 60,000 boxes of Zhenmei inventory in Morocco. It will be difficult for sales to turn active in these three months. General tea merchants are all worried.</p>

A total of 74 lots, amounting to 3,024 pieces, were listed, which was 1 lot and 226 pieces fewer than last week. Various merchant guilds showed slow sales. Sales were considered lively in the Yangtze River area, such as Hunan and Zhenjiang. However, although there was demand in the north, shipments were halted due to the Tianjin customs closure.

The supply of sugar leaving the warehouses became tight, and buying interest was lively, causing prices to gradually rise. The initial transaction price was seven taels, seven mace, seven and a half candareens, and demand was still strong, causing the price to rise to seven taels and eight mace. In the afternoon, buyers slowed down, and sellers were also scarce. The market shape was still favorable.

<p>Dentsu, Tokyo: The estimated total amount of foreign trade through 27 ports nationwide in the first half of Showa 5 (1930) is as follows (unit: 1,000 yen): Exports: 729,794; Imports: 947,592; Total: 1,677,386; Trade deficit: 217,788. Compared to the first half of last year, exports decreased by 28% and imports decreased by 26%. Regarding important commodities, Japan's largest export commodity is raw silk, but in the first half of this year, only 172,774,000 yen were exported, a sharp decrease of 176,839,000 yen compared to 349,613,000 yen in the same period last year, falling to less than half. Next, the export amount of cotton fabrics was 149,887,000 yen, and the export amount of silk fabrics was 55,180,000 yen, both with considerable decreases. The import amount of cotton, a major import commodity, was 260,708,000 yen, also a decrease of 69,302,000 yen. Based on this calculation, the total trade deficit for the first half of the year, including trade with colonies, was 270 million yen. The reasons for this trade slump are: 1. The fall in silver prices has greatly affected trade with China; 2. The sharp decline in U.S. raw silk consumption.</p>

<p>The schools have already started their holidays in the last few days, but in the morning, when the sun is just rising and the dew is like pearls, you can hear a majestic silver whistle and the commands "Attention!" and "Right face!" clearly coming from the lawn of Shanghai University. This is because their (Shanghai University's) Boy Scouts are staying on campus for a week of intensive training for their upcoming trip to Japan.</p>
<p>The number of people going to Japan this time, including the leader, Ni Jiaxi, is 41 (the general details were seen in this newspaper). Mr. Ni has now divided them into four teams: Crane, Deer, Eagle, and Tiger, and has appointed eight team leaders and deputy leaders, including Deng Ruiai, to be responsible for the duties of each team. There is also a Boy Scout basketball team organized to compete in friendly matches with their (Japanese) counterparts.</p>
<p>They have decided to depart at 9:00 AM on July 8th on the Nagasaki Maru from the Huishan Wharf and will arrive safely in Nagasaki on the 9th. Then, they will visit various scenic spots in foreign countries in order. Mr. Ni has also drafted the itinerary, which is as follows: July (9th) Nagasaki, (10th) Kobe, (12th) Osaka, (14th) Nara, (15th) Kyoto, (17th) Nagoya, (18th) Tokyo, (20th) Nikko, (29th) Yokohama, August (2nd) Kamakura, (4th) Mt.

<h3 id="e210">Recent Trends in German Drama, by Manhua <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>The German theater scene has shown distinctive changes in the last two months.</p>
<p>Now that spring has passed and summer has arrived, German drama is blooming with vibrant flowers. Many great plays have been performed one by one. Although there have been no amazing achievements, on average, there has been an opportunity for every German citizen to appreciate theatrical art. Half of this is due to the development of theatrical troupes, but the efforts of directors and actors cannot be ignored. As for the audience, it seems that there is a kind of preference, and this preference is the motivation for creating the current situation. They all like to study social, personal, and even political problems from the plays, thinking about what they reflect and what their meaning is. But strictly speaking, a play does not necessarily have to clearly solve a problem for you. If that were the case, it would become a paper solving problems, not a problem play. The so-called problem play uses sufficient force in the play to express a problem. The solution is either implied or left to the audience to think about with their own brains. There is no doubt that German audiences welcome plays about social and political problems, such as anti-Semitism, the drinking club movement, the ban on drugs, birth control, and the improvement of prisoner treatment. These are all the themes of the plays that have been popular in Berlin theaters in the spring and summer. Although the involvement is extensive, the result is successful. "Journey's End," which caused a sensation in the British literary world, has a German translation. It is considered one of the best war works of the year, but after the performance, it does not seem to have been a great success. As for the abolition of the death penalty, it has attracted a lot of attention in modern Germany, because the public has discovered many judicial errors. Langha Fulanck's "Ursache" discusses the abolition of the death penalty and advocates amending the current criminal law. Also, Wang Erfu's "Cyankali" and Kreide's "Article 218" have made considerable contributions to this issue. These two plays are not only suitable for stage application, but also have great achievements in directing and performance. Therefore, audiences are most satisfied with the selection of these two plays. In addition, Ficklinburg's "Amnesty" attracted many viewers to the Fuchsborn Theater with its brave attitude and detached thinking. Riefeqia Hawthorne's "Dreyfus's Miserable Memories" is a great tragedy against traditional thinking. Not only was the audience satisfied, but even the Berlin newspapers were full of praise, especially for the better criticism of Emile Zola, the protagonist who went to Dreyfus. Among many complicated issues, political concepts are the most profound. In the near future, it is expected that many plays on political issues will be produced. The most eye-catching is the play called "1914." The author of this play is called George William Mauchin. We don't care who Mauchin is; his name is always heard for the first time. But the fact is not so. Mauchin is the pseudonym of Emile Ludwig. As soon as Ludwig is mentioned, almost all Easterners know him. He is an authoritative figure in the German literary world. It is said that after the premiere of this "July 1914" in Berlin, other cities will perform it in order. Recently, there is a special phenomenon that was not seen in Berlin before, that is, the rejection of works by foreign writers. In the past two years, German theaters almost exclusively performed famous foreign plays. According to the statistics of one week in the German theater advertisements two years ago, there were three types of Shaw, two types of Wilde, and two types of Shakespeare. There was one of Galsworthy and five French comedies. At that time, German works were extremely pitiful and almost had no status. But now, times have changed. Depending on the natural trend, the result must not be intentional, and foreign works have gradually been rejected. Shaw's works are the only remaining ones, and there are only a few comedies popular in Paris.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Dutch Beauty Queen Deposed <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>The God of Beauty Comes from Herself. Add to the Garden.</p>
<p>She probably isn't qualified for beauty pageants anymore. This isn't just empty talk. You only have to look at the recent deposition of Dutch beauty queen Emmy Kuster to prove it. After she was selected, she was disqualified due to her age and marital status. But although she encountered misfortune and reigned for a very short time, this matter instead made her gain more admirers and exposed the naivety and ridiculousness of modern beauty pageants. After carefully inspecting many participating beauties, the judges in The Hague, the capital of the Netherlands, unanimously elected Emmy Kuster as Miss Netherlands and sent her to represent the Netherlands at the Miss World pageant held in America. There is no doubt that Ms. Emmy did possess the talent and appearance that a Dutch beauty should have, so after she was elected, the Dutch people congratulated her, believing that her beauty was enough to compete with beauties from any country without shame. But the unfortunate thing happened here. Because of her fame, everyone was naturally eager to know her family and living conditions. Unexpectedly, an investigation revealed that she was already thirty years old, had been married for eleven years, and had a nine-year-old daughter. So, a group of judges immediately reconvened and decided to depose her and add the title of Miss Netherlands to Ms. Mile Rie Vande Rese, who was originally the runner-up. Their reason was that the rules of the beauty pageant stipulate that only unmarried women under the age of twenty-five are allowed to participate, as if they thought that Ms. Emmy would never be beautiful due to her children and age. But unfortunately, it was still they themselves who chose Ms. Emmy as the most beautiful woman in the Netherlands. Why can't a married woman, and especially a glorious mother, be considered beautiful or even be excluded from the competition? This can be asked of Clement Vautel, the famous satirist of the Paris News. Below are his words:</p>
<p>"At the wedding feast on Mount Ida, when the gods were vying for the apple of beauty, the two most powerful competitors were both married. Juno was married to Jupiter, and Venus was married to Vulcan. She had also given birth to Cupid. If the rules at that time were the same as now, another competitor, Minerva, could have said to Paris, the judge, that they were married women and should be removed, and only I am a virgin, quickly give me the apple of beauty. But she didn't say it at the time, so Venus won after all. In my opinion, the only thing that matters in a beauty pageant is beauty. Marriage or childbirth doesn't matter. Open your eyes and you can see how many weak, thin, or even ugly women become beautiful and good-looking after they get married, get sexually satisfied, or become mothers. This kind of happy change is common, so how can we forbid them from joining? Especially in today's relaxed sexual relations, how can we recognize marriage as the decline of beauty and childbirth as the end of beauty? Is their restriction consistent with aesthetic viewpoints? In my personal opinion, thirty years old is the time when a woman is truly beautiful, not the beauty of hope, but the beauty of reality. The dismissal of the Dutch woman, in my opinion, is not only unfair, but also violates the good intentions of mankind." Vautel also said that this beauty pageant is an international competition, and the deposed Dutch woman might as well sue in the International Court, which is right next to her in The Hague.</p>

<p>Hudson Factory Owner's Record After Visiting the *Crow* Automobile Exhibition</p>
<p>The Grandest Event in the United States</p>
<p>The 1930 American Automobile Exhibition was a hundred times more lively and magnificent than in previous years. The automobiles displayed by each factory were the latest, most magnificent, strongest, and most unique vehicles of 1930. The progress of modern mechanical science is so ingenious and rapid that it is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>This year's exhibition not only shows that the automobile industry is a source of wealth for American finances, but also a driving force for the development of everything. The factories joining the association have a total of 4.5 million workers, a total capital of 40 billion U.S. dollars, and are the largest factories that use the most steel, copper, lead, coal, wood, leather, velvet fabrics, glass, and paint.</p>
<p>A Billion-Dollar Business</p>
<p>This great automobile industry contains billions of dollars in costs. People across the country have a stake in it and should bear a share of the responsibility. This huge amount of commercial development increases profits tenfold without limit. At the end of each month, the country's finances are always affected, and even countries around the world are amazed.</p>
<p>Today, 15 million Americans rely on the automobile industry for their livelihood. These people are the highest paid and most well-treated. There are approximately 25 million vehicles traveling across the country every day. The value of automobiles produced each year is approximately 40 billion gold dollars. The value of spare parts and miscellaneous items already in use is over 65 billion yuan. In 1929, automobile taxes totaled 925 million gold dollars, which is staggering. Twenty states across the country have automobile manufacturing plants or assembly plants. Last year, 37 states opened 7,500 automobile branch plants.</p>
<p>Developing Other Businesses</p>
<p>The automobile industry has developed, and the gasoline and rubber industries have also increased sharply as a result. The railway transportation industry has also greatly developed. Statistics show that more than 3.5 million freight cars are used to transport automobiles each year. More than 3 million people are employed to manage car affairs. From the above numbers and the large amount of raw materials and great manpower, it can be seen that the automobile industry is indeed the largest in scale among various industries. Huge amounts of money are spent on research and improvement to ensure that car owners enjoy full benefits. The development of automobiles is changing with each passing day and can be said to have reached its peak.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Exhibition</p>
<p>New styles and increased colors. This year's automobile exhibition is truly unprecedented. The revitalization of the automobile industry is of great significance to the saving of time and space, the increase of its function and capacity, the development of domestic business, and the happiness of society. Today, the position occupied by automobiles has become a central object, and the revitalization of everything depends on it.</p>
<p>8 Million Workers Include One-Third of the Country's Population. No other event in the world is more grand than this. This year's automobile exhibition meets the interests of the people, promotes the progress of business, adapts to the trends of the world, and provides for the needs of society. It can be called the supreme event in the United States and an unprecedented exhibition in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e216">The International Automobile Championship - Ji Ren <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>One Hundred and Fifty Cars Competing - Nashi Declared the Winner</p>
<p>The annual International Automobile Championship held in France took place this spring at the Leme Racecourse. A total of 150 cars participated. Nashi's car emerged victorious, demonstrating not only superior speed but also exceptional mechanical endurance. The George Ham's gold medal was awarded publicly, along with a championship flag for commemoration. Nashi's car factory received an avalanche of congratulatory telegrams from various countries, making its name a sensation in Europe and America. Nashi "400" secured the leading title in the international automobile realm. Nashi's unexpected victory in the 5,000-kilometer championship was attributed to the lack of prior preparation or testing. The factory randomly selected two cars for the competition: a dual large-cylinder car driven by Mr. Luo Wen and a dual large eight-cylinder car driven by Mr. Tu Mu. In the end, Mr. Tu's car scored the highest and performed the best. Despite the intense and challenging competition, Nashi's car suffered no damage. Nashi "400" ultimately won the international championship and broke a world record.</p>
<p>The speed of Tu Mu's Nashi dual large eight-cylinder car averaged 100 kilometers per hour this year, with a top speed of 138 kilometers per hour. While speed is important in this competition, agility, ease of operation, convenient control, and road safety are also key judging criteria. The French Automobile Spring Race is the most enthusiastic competition in the world, with historical value, emotional significance, and mechanical testing. It originated from the earlier Glidden Tour and the Pikes Peak Hill Climb. This year's race started from Porte Maillot in Paris and ended at Le Havre and Lille, covering a total of 5,000 kilometers over eight days, involving various tests of mountain climbing, air conditioning, braking, and speed, with excellent results.</p>
<p>Temporary care stations were set up along the final race route, with personnel patrolling and monitoring the cars' movements day and night. Notaries accompanied the cars to record the drivers' skills and the cars' performance. Mechanics and judges were on hand to inspect and score various situations, such as increased heat during uphill climbs, valve damage, driver fatigue, and uncomfortable seating.</p>
<p>Each time a race car arrived at a station, it was put on display for the audience to view and to solicit opinions from visitors for public judgment. Remarkably, everyone praised Nashi cars as the most magnificent and robust among all the cars. Its swift and steady performance on rural roads and fields, and its exceptional durability, truly made it a leader among automobiles. Since this competition, Nashi's reputation in France has grown day by day, and people's confidence in it has deepened. The number of managers and distributors has greatly increased, and sales have also suddenly increased tenfold. According to news reporters who participated in monitoring the competition, Nashi never encountered any obstacles along the difficult journey and maintained smooth and perfect performance from beginning to end. During an air conditioning test in the city of Blois, the weather was rainy and cold that night, but the Nashi car was able to travel ten kilometers in five seconds comfortably and steadily. Nashi "400" is indeed the most ideal car for all-weather travel.</p>
<p>Neither of the two Nashi cars that participated were custom-made. The dual-spark six-cylinder car driven by Mr. Luo Wen was randomly selected from a large batch of cars shipped directly from the American headquarters to France. The dual-spark eight-cylinder car driven by Mr. Tu Mu was selected from the local management office's showroom. It is truly remarkable that these two cars were entered into this intense competition and won the championship among 150 carefully selected and finely crafted automobiles, and that their bodies remained strong throughout. It is therefore not surprising that Nashi cars are praised and trusted by Europeans and Americans alike. Do not rank at the top.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Automotive Manufacturing Industry Growth - Lin <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Small Cars Sell Well</p>
<p>The British automobile market showed signs of progress in 1929. According to "Motor Trade" magazine, the total number of cars of various styles manufactured in Britain that year was 180,426, valued at £44,945,918. In terms of both quantity and value, this represents a significant increase compared to previous years. The previous year's car production was 154,495 units, valued at £38,763,946, but car production in 1928 was lower than in 1927, which saw a total of 161,920 cars manufactured, valued at £43,550,561. However, this was only a temporary deviation, as the automobile industry has been growing and developing since 1922. In that year, only 38,000 cars were manufactured, valued at £20,500,000. In eight years, the number of cars manufactured has increased fivefold. However, the value has only increased by slightly more than double, which is due to the decrease in car prices and the popularity of smaller cars, which are also less expensive. Regarding the production of small cars, there have been many changes. Twelve-horsepower cars used to dominate the automotive industry, and their sales often topped the charts due to their popularity. However, according to the breakdown of various car production figures in 1929, many changes have been observed. The number of ten-horsepower and below cars was no less than 73,289, accounting for more than half of the total. The speed of its development can be seen from the production figures for 1928 and 1927, which were 50,586 and 38,992 respectively. Last year, the number of twelve-horsepower cars was 45,364. A comparison with the production figures for twelve-horsepower cars in 1928 and 1927 reveals a significant change, with 51,915 in 1928 and 69,996 in 1927. The second most outstanding car was the six-horsepower, with 24,758 units produced last year, 12,398 in 1928, and only 11,220 in 1927. The total number of the above-mentioned ten-horsepower and below, twelve-horsepower, and sixteen-horsepower cars was 143,411 last year. The production volume of various cars</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>The total number is 180,426 units. The magnitude of the demand can be imagined. The changes and the increase in the first two items and the decline in the third item are quite interesting. The growth of small cars is due to the popularity of seven-horsepower and eight-horsepower cars. These cars are the cheapest and have low running costs, and they run smoothly. The sixteen-horsepower car occupies an outstanding position because experienced drivers all want to switch to larger horsepower. The characteristic of the sixteen-horsepower is that the engine power is increased, while the price is not very different from that of small models. In short, this car is the best of the cars and the price has a certain standard. The reason for the lower sales of twelve-horsepower cars may be due to the change to larger horsepower. The twelve-horsepower car can be called a large-scale production compared to other cars made in Britain. There are often two or three factories that produce large quantities, all built according to their respective models. However, this is a reproduction of work, so its appearance is often similar. In this situation, the independent nature is often reduced, and British car drivers regard the car's inability to be unique and novel as wrong.</p>
<p>The above statistics do not include Ford's production. The mutual connection of British car manufacturers is also being heard more and more. In recent years, the names of several famous factories have disappeared from the list of car manufacturers. The difficult situation of small manufacturers has not been eliminated. For example, out of the total of 10,426 cars last year, 160,000 cars were manufactured by nine factories, and 140,000 of these 160,000 cars came from five factories.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Long-Distance Buses in Guangzhou Special Municipality - Huang Lang <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>The Guangzhou Special Municipality has a vast area and frequent transportation, making it easier to carry out road construction compared to Shanghai, where the concessions have limited the extent of development. With the recent opening of roads, the flow of merchants has become more convenient. The most important benefit of transportation is naturally public buses, but the regulations are strict and restrictions are tight. Here is a summary of recent news:</p>
<p>Regulations on Bus Operating Hours: It has been decided by the municipal government's administrative meeting to extend the operating hours of long-distance passenger buses by two hours, from 6:00 AM to 12:00 AM daily, to facilitate transportation. The Public Utilities Bureau has been instructed to notify all companies to comply.</p>
<p>Designated Bus Routes: As Guangzhou's roads are being opened up and bus traffic is increasing, accidents often occur due to speeding. To maintain public safety and eliminate danger, it is planned to build pedestrian routes, each 20 feet in diameter, with stone along the edges of easy-to-walk channels at intersections and T-junctions on various roads. Pedestrians must cross the road within the lines. Traffic will be directed by the police at turning points on each road, and red lights will be installed at turning lines, similar to Shanghai. In addition, white wooden signs will be erected on suburban roads where there is no lighting at night. All of these measures are designed to facilitate traffic and avoid danger.</p>
<p>Buses Must Not Arbitrarily Display Advertisements: All advertisements inside and outside long-distance passenger buses must not be posted arbitrarily to avoid obstructing the view. Recently, many advertisements have been posted inside the buses, covering the stop schedules, and the Public Utilities Bureau has strictly ordered them to be removed.</p>
<p>Painting and Repairing Buses: The vehicles and components of long-distance passenger buses should be repaired immediately and the bodies repainted. Repairs should be completed within this year so that the buses can be driven to the Public Utilities Bureau for inspection and renewal of licenses, to enhance the appearance.</p>
<p>Circle-City Buses Now in Operation: The municipal government has decided to operate circle-city long-distance buses to facilitate travel for residents around the city. It has purchased four municipal buses from Hong Kong. To test the speed and reliability of the buses, the municipal government conducted a trial run on the 23rd of last month, driving the buses around the city for an actual test. The buses have fourteen seats, with white paint on the upper part of the exterior and green paint on the lower part. Both sides have the city emblem, which is very beautiful. They have recently been put into operation to benefit travelers. The route has a total of six stops, each charging eight copper coins. The route starts from the West Gate to the Provincial Government, which is one stop. From Yuehua Road to Panyu County, which is the second stop. From Panyu County, Dadongmen, Xiaodongmen is one stop. From Xiaodongmen to Guolan Street is the third stop. From Weixin Road Intersection to Pujiao Bridge is the fourth stop. From Pujiao Bridge to West Gate is one stop. All the citizens praise the convenience.</p>
<p>Changing the Names of Bus Routes: The Public Utilities Bureau has named the Guangzhou long-distance bus routes with the three colors of red, yellow, and green to distinguish them. Now, as the number of roads increases, the names of the routes should be redefined. The original yellow route, which was divided into three stops, is now changed to the first route, the second route, and the third route. The red bus is changed to the fourth route, and the original green route is changed to the fifth route. Recently, the sixth route, the eighth route, the ninth route, the tenth route, the eleventh route, and the twelfth route have been newly opened. In the future, new routes will be named according to these numbers to facilitate distinction and memorization. The proposal has been submitted to the Municipal Council for approval and has been ordered to be implemented.</p>
<p>Banning Special License Plates: The municipal government believes that five buses should be opened first on the Dongmen to Shahe route to facilitate transportation. The special license plates previously issued by the Dong'an Company, which is contracted to operate the Dongshen Road bus route from the Cangbian Road intersection to Shahe, and all rotten "wild chicken car" license plates will be collected and revoked and not allowed to operate on that route.</p>
