<p>外交部於二十八日上午派鮑靜安至中央廣播電臺報告最近外交形勢其詞如下最近外交方面因國家已統一反動份子已肅清各國對華外交已一洗昔日之觀望態度而准備與我方繼續談判一切問題觀於近日各國駐華公使由平南來參加國府之討逆勝利慶祝大會·及彼等返平後對國府之言論即可證明各國對華態度之變更上月英外交總長漢德森在外交委員會之演說已明顯表示英政府有完全接受中國一切合理要求之决心並認不平等條約之存在爲不合日本政府亦有取消對華稱（支那）之通令凡此種種皆足表示國民政府之威信日著中國在國際上之地位漸提高此皆可告慰於國人者也蓋無論何國之外交必須有全國人民爲後盾而後始可言勝利前次以馮閣叛逆致各國存觀望之心各項交涉曾有一度之停頓中國統一現已告成此後外交方面自當有顯著之進展也至於最近外交方面事件約有數端茲可分别述之於下</p>
<p>（一）法權談判關於法權問題現正由外部與各國分别進行中美方面仍由伍公使繼續與美國務院直接交涉美方提案現已送達外部現正在精愼審查中中英方面仍由王外長與英藍使接洽至於中法談判現由法使韋禮德與王外長進行談判關於法權收回廣州灣漢口租界及改組上海法界會審公堂各間題均已提出討論韋使已電其政府請示中日商約問題自上次王外長與日代辦重光葵在京談判後日代辦已將交涉情形呈報日政府俟接到覆訓當可繼續會商惟法權問题極爲重要英法美等國是否能就範圍尙屬疑問前途未可樂觀須全國一致奮起作政府後盾</p>
<p>（一）中俄交涉中俄正式會議自十一月十一日開幕後以俄方堅持伯力會議恊定有效而我方則認爲該項恊定未經中央承認且曾正式否認殊難認爲有效故會議迄無進步莫代表現仍留俄境以便相機進行會議並未决裂現仍在非正式交換意見中深望俄方能早日覺悟俾會議繼續進行</p>
<p>（三）中日交涉上月間中日間最重要交涉即爲龍井村案關於該案之發生報章已詳有紀載外部現接報告龍井村日警經我方積極交涉之結果已於本月五日奉朝鮮日總督命令實行撤退至此龍井村案已告結束第二爲中日電信交涉該項交涉因雙方意見尙未完全接近故尙無顯著之進展現經雙方非正式交換意見之結果已漸有頭绪不久即可繼續會商</p>
<p>（四）收回租界租借地收回天津比國租界恊定係於十八年八月三十一日在天津簽字並規定於恊定批准書互換後即定期實行接收該項恊定並經於十八年十一月七日由我國政府批准最近該項恊定已經比國會正式通過批准文件不日即可寄到一俟雙方定期互換後即發生效力同時即可定期接收至於厦門鼓浪嶼公共租界外部正在進行中一俟準備就緒即可向各國提出收回</p>
<p>（五）訂约交涉關於訂約交涉可分别述之於下（甲）中國波斯商約中波訂約交涉曾由外部令駐義代辦蔣履福負責與駐義波斯公使進行談判日前駐義波使曾親訪蔣代辦謂已奉本國政府命令與我國開議並已頒發全權證書蔣代辦電部後外部已呈准國府頒發全權證書令蔣代辦即日與波使開始談判（乙）中尼恊定查商改中美尼加拉圭國待遇華人苛律事前經呈派駐巴拿馬代辦李世中兼任駐尼加拉圭總領事馳往尼京交涉現雙方根據自動限制原則已議訂華人赴尼待遇恊定十二條大致爲中國政府自行限制每年赴尼華僑人數而尼政府則取銷關於華人移民法等等有效期間暫定六年外部已呈請國府頒發簽字全權證書一俟證書寄到該項草案即可正式簽字（丙）南斐洲南斐政府對於華僑素極苛遇對於營業居住等等限制極嚴最近外部爲保護旅居南斐洲僑民起見已準備與南斐聯邦政府訂立商約現已電令駐南斐總領事何鑽調查現有若干國已與南斐訂有商約並查明各約本以資參考以爲訂約張本同時又令駐南斐總領先與斐外部試議移民商務但在未受本國訓令以前不受拘束（丁）多明尼加共和國最近駐古巴多明尼加國公使正式向我國駐古巴公使提議與我國商訂商約外部已電駐古凌公使先行調查旅多華僑人數及商務情形然後再定辦法（戊）中捷條約中捷友好通商條約自本年四月二十五日經國府批准後批准書已於本月二十日在南京互換依照規定該約自互換之日起於第十五日發生效力計至十二月五日起該約即可生效按國民政府與無約國家新訂條約發生效力者第一爲中希遹好條約第二即爲中捷條約（已）中和關稅條約換文民國十七年十二月十九日在南京簽字之中和關稅條約批准書已於本月十六日下午在南京由王外長與和使歐登科互換查十七年簽訂各約早經發生效力僅一中和關稅條約因未互換批准文件故未生效現中和條約批准書已互換至此中國關稅自主已告完全成功</p>
<p>（六）保護海外華僑關於交涉取消南洋和屬增加入境稅事外部曾於九月十三日照遠駐華和使一面由駐和代辦戴明輔直接與和政府提出交涉迄今尙無若何進步外部以和屬準備增加入境稅雖稱普及各國人民惟華人赴和屬者實較他國人民爲多現行稅額已覺負擔過重萬難再事增加按諸兩國友好精神互惠原則亦不宜有此舉故根諸此義已於本月十五日再行對和使提出抗議同時駐和戴代辦亦對和外部繼續抗爭矣　　（七）使館南遷查南京旣爲首都各國使館自應設於南京前次各使館南遷事曾經進行但後以時局變化以致稍受挫頓現全國已告統一各使館已無復流連北平之必要最近各使南來亦俱感有將使館遷京之需要四中全會時又通過王外長撥地爲各國使館建築之提案現外部正與各關係方面進行此事以便各使館得早日南遷</p>

<p>童行白演講</p>
<p>上海特别市黨部主辦之合作事業指導員講習所籌備迄今已逾一月現内部已組織就緒昨日舉行開學典禮到敎職員學員及來賓共五十餘人由所長童行白主席鍾維石紀錄首由主席致詞繼由敎職員張廷灝程君清及來賓張國維等相繼演講關於台作事業之理論方案均有簡明精深之闡發演詞甚長從略茲將主席講詞略誌如下各位同志今天市黨部所主辦之合作事業指導員講習所舉行開學典禮我們爲什麽要辦這個講習所如果知道了這一點就可以看得出市黨部對於合作事業是非常注意而要急切求其實現了普通以爲合作運動與黨的關係祗是與國貨運動造林運動同樣爲黨的副工作而不知合作事業是三民主義的經濟建設的重心因爲三民主義不僅要解决政治問題民族問題抑且要解决經濟問題但解决經濟問題不僅消極的掃除經濟的缺點而且要積極的實行經濟的建設三民主義的經濟建設如何總理遺敎已明白告訴我們世界社會經濟進化不外四個原則（一）社會工業之改良（二）交通運輸收歸公有（三）直接徵稅（四）分配社會化但我們把他分析歸納起來可說前二種是求生產之發達後二種是求分配之均平換言之就是解决生產和分配問題而已由此可知經濟的中心問題問不外生產和分配因爲第一二兩項要社會工業改良運輸交通機關收歸公有均是促進生產發達的方法其第三項是直接徵稅徵諸資本階級的赢餘項下損有餘而補不足亦爲分配均平的辦法至於第四項分配社會化就是說明合作的組織表面上似乎專講分配其實合作不但可以解决分配問題抑且可以解决生產問題因爲合作事業之所以分配是爲生產而分配合作事業之所以生產是爲分配而生產合作事業成功社會的經濟建設才有基礎所以以上四種經濟進化的情形以第四種爲最重要故總理獨於第四種分配之社會化（即合作制度）最爲激賞而不絶贊歎今後本黨經濟建設之首要要充分發展合作事業使社會上寄生階級剝奪階級减少起來社會的進化人羣的福利全賴乎此現在革命雖未澈底成功但國内不良份子已漸次廓清社會經濟制度之樹立經濟組織之建設都是此後本黨努力之標的我們創辦合作事業指導員講習所的意義就在這一點惟是合作學理深奥具備此項智識的人才很少就是本黨同志研究這項學識的人也是不多所以我們一方面更要激勸同志都來切實地研究</p>
<p>以造就專門人才一方面要諸位負起宣傳指導的責任來使民衆都對於合作事業有一個普通的認識具體的建設同時希望各位於學成之後視合作事業作爲終身的信仰隨時隨地切實奉行不可僅視爲個人謀事供職的一個工具須知合作主義是民生主義中的一部分實行合作主義就是實行三民主義這一次本所開學又承中國合作學社諸同志擔任敎職這一種熱心毅力非常感激同時各同志也應深體此意努力求知方不辜負諸講師之熱望及本所開辦之初意</p>
<h3 id="c132">總理紀念塔圖樣首選 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>范文照趙深兩君</p>
<p>設計大槪之略述</p>
<p>慨自總理逝世以來中央爲謀紀念永遠昭揚不朽起見乃計劃撥國幣五十萬元就陵園建築總理紀念塔一座由管理陵園委員會邀請中外之著名建築師設計圖樣爲時已數閱月矣昨經該會將各呈到圖樣開始評判結果爲本埠著名建築師范文照·趙深·兩君獲列第一茲將該兩君設計大槪略述如下</p>
<p>一·紀念塔外部計劃全塔純取中國古式注重莊雅其高度共二百二十尺分十五層平面作八角形塔底建兩級石</p>
<p>座以雄山勢每級石座之内分成兩層塔身第三與第十五兩層各建平台俾遊人登覽其餘各層均免平台佈置庶遊人之欲高贍四方風景者可直上至頂藉以普遍三民主義之宣傳塔頂亭子式佈置精緻亭子之上又加出頂蓋以壯巍峨塔之四週築一廣大八角形平台沿下又設較小之平台四座以宏塔勢並供遊人觀瞻</p>
<p>二·紀念塔内部計劃塔内有數點最重要者（一）每層設兩扶梯置於塔之中心取連環式並從寛大一上一下使遊人樂於登臨不致發生衝撞（二）每層四週走廊不使間斷俾遊人得適當地位誦讀三民主義全文而無擁擠侷促之患（三）每層於扶梯中間留一深井可自頂一直俯視到底傳播上下聲色以助興趣（四）每層刻三民主義自下而下均取聯絡式使文句不致間斷或不拘講文字句之長短與墻面地位之寛窄將各層所刻之字體加以變通限定每一層刻一講抑不按序次以講文字句較多之一講而刻墻面較寛之一層（五）每層刻</p>
<p>文地位之上開列二十四窗户使光線與空氣兩告充足下置護壁石板以臻完美</p>
<p>三·紀念塔四週計劃塔身因須居陵南北中線之上故全部地盤佈置有按此中線設計之必要所以應將原有環陵路重修以爲直達紀念塔之主要途徑並於中線與環陵路啣接之處開闢一廣闊之塲週園可供停放車輛塲之一端建一大石牌樓爲入紀念塔之正門由此直上就山之地勢關條甬道由甬道進達紀念塔之四週平台甬道之外另築環山</p>
<p>馬路庶遊人不走甬道者由主路之兩端亦可駕車而蒞塔之後部闢一停車場又山背部闢條便道直通山後現有馬路塔之兩旁各建小亭以便遊人駐足</p>
<p>休憩</p>
<p>四·紀念塔建築材料紀念塔爲表彰典型永遠不朽取材自重堅久耐固故塔身須用完全鋼骨水泥爲結構外墻及屋面完全用顏色愽雅之花崗石内墻因須刻鐫文字應用大理石扶梯及欄杆等亦宜配合大理石俾臻宏偉所需材料除鋼骨仍須仰給舶來者外餘皆儘國產購用</p>

<p>Feng Will Take the Siberian Route</p>
<p>Yan Is Still Hesitating and Undecided</p>
<p>Beiping – Yan is collecting hundreds of copies of books printed in Shanxi in recent years, such as "People's Handbook," "Village Head's Handbook," and "Labor-Capital Cooperation," to take abroad for propaganda purposes. The Riverbank Village has been discussing departure routes for days. Zhao Daiwen, Shang Zhen, and others said that the Central Government and the Northeast both hope Yan will leave soon and suggested openly taking a special train via Zhengtai, Pingjin. Zhao Pilian, Jia Jingde, and others are concerned about the possibility of being detained and advocate taking a secret route. Yan is inherently suspicious and is now even more indecisive. Recently, Sun Chu, Yuan Qingzeng, Wang Jingguo, Yuan Pingfan, and other troops have been ordered to move towards northern Shanxi and Suiyuan, allegedly with the intention of seizing Ningxia as an alternative plan if going abroad fails. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping – Li Dequan, accompanied by three English, German, and Russian translators and Zhen Shikui, a representative of Lu, went to Shanxi last week. At that time, Feng was still in Fenyang. On the morning of the 26th, Feng and his party arrived in Datong. Xu Yongchang had secretly telegraphed the Datong Garrison Department, Chu Xichun, Zhang Huizhao, and others to protect Feng and his party. They immediately took a special train prepared by Chu to Pingdi Spring, then changed to a car and followed the Pingpang Road to Pangjiang, then transferred to the Zhangku automobile road, passing through Kulun and Chakhtu to board a Siberian train to leave the country. This route was the one Feng took to Russia and Germany in his early years, so he resolutely proceeded. (28th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Breaking Through the Economic Crisis (II) <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>In addition to external development, the policies of various countries to break through the economic crisis mainly focus on alleviating unemployment. Although the severity of unemployment varies from country to country, it is generally increasing daily, and the situation is becoming more and more serious. The relief measures formulated by the government are often attacked by opponents, making the government even more difficult. Opponents often criticize the government, saying that it has failed to devise any effective measures. Although their words are somewhat demanding, the relief efforts undertaken by various countries recently have not shown any significant results. The reason for this is partly due to the difficulty of raising relief funds and partly due to the complicated and unsystematic relief policies. To give one example, since the unemployment problem arose, countries with overseas residents, such as the governments of the United States, Mexico, and various parts of Southeast Asia, have generally increased the harshness of regulations for foreigners entering the country, revised regulations for foreigners residing in the country, or even expelled them under various pretexts, intending to have one less foreigner in the country and thus one less person occupying jobs, so that more of the country's people can maintain their livelihoods and reduce unemployment. In fact, it is very difficult for foreigners to come, and the jobs they obtain are not illegitimate. It must be understood that other countries have merchants in our country, and we also have merchants in other countries. If we do not want other countries to treat us harshly, then people will not want our country to treat them harshly. This is what is meant by equal treatment in the world and easy to see. Now, if we want to reduce domestic unemployment at the expense of increasing unemployment for people in other countries, it is not a fair way to treat people. If countries reciprocate by dealing with our overseas residents in this way, it is tantamount to our relief policy being equal to zero, or even more than we can afford to lose. Furthermore, their outward-looking development policies are also inevitably affected to a considerable extent. Therefore, I say that using this selfish approach to break through the economic crisis only makes the crisis more difficult. It is a serious mistake.</p>

<p>German Authorities Announce Polish Atrocities</p>
<p>League of Nations Finds Handling Difficult</p>
<p>Königsberg Dispatch from the National News Agency, 27th: Attacks by Poles on the German minority have now spread to the Province of Königsberg within Polish territory. In Thorn (Toruń), Polish nationalists gathered a crowd to destroy a German club, seriously injuring several members of the German community. The German government has instructed the German consul in Thorn to submit a detailed report for further protest to the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch, Berlin, 27th: The German government has decided to submit the matter of the maltreatment of the German minority in Poland to the Council of the League of Nations in January. At the same time, it will take diplomatic action in the capitals of various countries to draw international attention to the matter. Today, the authorities released a document stating that German investigations into recent disturbances during elections in the village of Goraschowitz in Polish Silesia revealed that twenty-five armed Poles, some in uniform, entered the village and abused a German church organist, searched the apartments of German pastors and German schools, and committed various atrocities, such as forcing farmers to swear oaths to vote for the government. The police and local officials did not intervene. As for the claim that Germans killed Polish police officers, there is no evidence to support this.</p>
<p>Geneva Dispatch from the National News Agency, 27th: Germany's protest against Poland's mistreatment of the German minority is causing considerable difficulty for the League of Nations. Given the close ties between France and Poland, any proposal to correct Poland would be opposed by France. Therefore, it will be extremely difficult to handle this matter in the Council of the League of Nations, and the result may further increase the entanglement of the European political situation. Currently, Polish Foreign Minister Zaleski has invited Mr. Calonder of Switzerland, head of the Upper Silesian Mixed Commission, to Warsaw to discuss the situation after Germany's protest to the international community and the truth of Mr. Calonder's personal investigation. Mr. Calonder is known for his impartiality, and the Germans have great confidence in him. (Note: The situation of the German minority in Poland is somewhat similar to that of overseas Chinese students in Siam, Annam, and the islands of Southeast Asia today. The difference is that they are recognized as Polish citizens, while overseas Chinese are recognized as Chinese citizens. Therefore, Germany's handling methods may also serve as a reference for us.)</p>
<p>Warsaw Dispatch from the National News Agency, 28th: The Polish government today actually claimed that it had uncovered a large number of reactionary conspiracy organizations among small ethnic minorities. Recently, seven Belarusians were arrested in Wieluń, accused of smuggling explosives from Germany to carry out sabotage in Poland. Two of the seven are women. In addition, a German teacher and two customs officials were arrested for assisting the seven criminals.</p>

<p>Reuters Dispatch, London, 27th: Conservative Party leader Baldwin today moved a vote of no confidence in the House of Commons, criticizing the government for failing to plan any effective ways to expand imperial trade and refusing to consider the proposals of British dominions. Baldwin rebuked the government for lacking vision and courage and for failing to seize the opportunity for imperial economic unity, stating that he believed that if no way was found to achieve economic unity within the Empire, the dangers to unity would be great. If Britain does not agree on a solution with the dominions, the dominions will agree on solutions among themselves and no longer consider the mother country. Dominions Affairs Secretary Thomas replied that what the dominions most strongly requested was that Britain agree to impose food taxes. At the same time, they would change existing methods. What they were asking Britain to change was Britain's principles, while what they were changing was only a few sub-items. The result of the Imperial Conference has strengthened the current constitutional position of the Empire and opened the door to future consideration of economic issues. As for the view that only material considerations can unite the Empire, he could not agree. Conservative Party member Amery stated that the proposals of the previous Bonar Law had not received full discussion, and it was regrettable that the government had missed the opportunity. Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden stated that the opportunity lost was the opportunity to tax food and increase the economic burden on Britain, and that Britain would lose even more in trade opportunities. The House of Commons later rejected the impeachment motion by a vote of 299 to 2124.</p>

<p>Engaging in Special Military Organizations</p>
<p>Inviting Foreign Armed Intervention</p>
<p>Defendant Laimin-Hsin Provides Testimony Forthrightly</p>
<p>Moscow Dispatch from the National News Agency, 27th: Today, the trial of the case concerning liaison with various agencies in Paris in October 1928 to discuss intervention issues and the implementation of industrial groups. The French General Staff was also a strong advocate for establishing a special military organization within the industrial group and was in constant contact with the Frenchman R, who resided in Moscow. While in London, he felt that both the Deterding and Urquhart factions paid particular attention to the intervention plan, but after the change of the British government, the policy changed and interest waned. Since the early spring of last year, the French have increasingly demanded the addition of military organizations within the industrial group, and the group has increasingly become the French General Staff's agency in Russia. It was originally planned to intervene last year, but the tension between France and Italy and the problems between France and Germany, coupled with the fact that the Red Army showed stronger strength than expected during the Sino-Soviet conflict, they hesitated to act. First, it was proposed to weaken Soviet Russia's economic capabilities through economic blockade, and then organize committees in various places to prepare for a final intervention in 1931.</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch, Moscow, 27th: The treason case was retried today. According to the official news agency, the defendant Kubliyanov, an engineer, has prepared a detailed confession outlining his involvement in economic sabotage since 1919. Another defendant, Professor Zhanovsky, confessed that he was induced by the hope of restoring the old system and participated slightly in illegal activities, deeply regretting that foreign forces, especially France, supported this movement.</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch, Moscow, 28th: The official news agency continues to publish reports of the confessions of the defendants in the counter-revolutionary case, while the Moscow dispatch from the Associated Press states that the trial scene looks like a Hollywood film set, with dazzling lights illuminating the courtroom.

<p>Proposed Further Spending Cuts</p>
<p>Criticism from the Seiyukai</p>
<p>Total Amount of Unemployment Bonds Undetermined</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Agency Dispatch, Tokyo, 28th: When implementing this year's budget, the government, due to a sharp decrease in actual tax revenues and the lack of any remaining funds, had no choice but to drastically cut the approved expenditure by more than 60 million yuan. However, there are still four months remaining in the current fiscal year, making it difficult to implement the budget. As a result of yesterday's provincial meeting of the Ministry of Finance, it was decided to adopt appropriate methods regarding the future situation and further reduce expenditures.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Agency Dispatch: Regarding the difficulty in implementing the next year's budget, the Seiyukai criticized that the estimated tax revenues for this year were excessively high, amounting to approximately 200 million yuan, which our party has repeatedly pointed out. If this continues, the budget may not be implemented by the end of the year. As a result, the credit of the next year's budget is equal to zero. The current cabinet's deceptive politics have been completely exposed.</p>
<p>Japan Allied News Agency Dispatch: Regarding the reduction of expenses for the fifth year of Showa, the proposal submitted by Finance Minister Inoue has been decided by the cabinet as follows: (1) Strive to reduce year-end bonuses for the fifth year of Showa.

In addition, the unemployment bonds for the Ministry of Railways are 10 million yuan, and for the Ministry of Communications are 3 million yuan, totaling approximately 41 million yuan for all ministries.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Public Telegram <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Telegram: To all newspapers: We are sending a telegram to the National Government stating that Shandong Province has suffered the most severe disaster, and the counties have repeatedly received the government's decree to issue funds for relief. The Central Relief Committee has also distributed relief funds to the disaster-stricken counties in the war zone. The people of Shandong Province are deeply grateful. This association deeply understands the government's concern for the people and the Provincial Government's earnestness in urging relief efforts. We have been raising funds and distributing them to comfort the wounded and the dead, exhausting our voices and neglecting our sleep, but after the war, the disaster victims are crying out, and a cup of water cannot extinguish a burning cart of firewood, making it difficult to provide universal assistance. This association has done its best, but we still feel ashamed towards many disaster victims. This year's war in Shandong involved more than 100,000 rebellious troops for several months. Bandits and reactionary elements looted and extorted at will, causing traffic to be cut off, farmers and merchants to lose their jobs, and repeated droughts and floods to occur, making it impossible to harvest in time. For example, in Dong'e and Wuding and the counties north of the Yellow River, troops and bandits have been stationed for half a year, and the Provincial Government's orders do not reach them. In Dengzhou, Laizhou, and Qingzhou, some areas have been occupied by bandits, and the situation is special, or the national army has repeatedly launched offensive and defensive operations to suppress the rebellion, disrupting the Jiaoji Railway and causing panic due to gunfire for several months. Yizhou was occupied by Gao Guizi, and bandits roamed the area. The national army fought until the recapture of Jinan, and the people were able to live in peace. In Jining and Caozhou, large armies were stationed, and Xue Chuanfeng occupied five counties, including Fan Guanchao, conscripting supplies and draining the pond to catch fish. In counties such as Yanzhou and Tai'an, which are located at key north-south transportation hubs, the military was bound to fight on the one hand, and the people had no way to survive on the other. The rebellious army stubbornly resisted, guarding the city and building fortifications, and fiercely fought with artillery fire. For example, Tai'an and Wenshang were bombed for a long time before they were pacified. In the Battle of Qufu, the Confucius Temple and the Yan Temple were destroyed by artillery fire. The government even sent officials to Qufu to distribute emergency relief. The government is well aware of all these situations and deeply feels the pain of those who are drowning and starving. However, the amount of relief funds issued by the decree to several counties is mostly 30,000 for the larger ones and 20,000 for the smaller ones, which is not a small amount. The Central Relief Committee has issued 3,000 yuan to Tai'an and 20 yuan to Ziyang, totaling 3,020 yuan, for the war zone relief funds. This association has repeatedly held meetings to discuss and distribute all its resources to the counties with the most severe disasters, allocating 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per county to the disaster victims. In total, how much can the disaster victims receive from these relief funds? The people are innocent and have suffered from the war for a long time, resulting in death, injury, illness, separation of parents, wives, and children, destruction of fields and houses, inability to work, and lack of ability to use their skills. When they are fortunate enough to see peace, they are already on the verge of death. How can any local official not feel heartache? This association is an organization to save people's livelihoods and takes the comfort of disaster victims as its mission. We have discussed and debated repeatedly and unanimously agree that the emergency relief is too little for too many, and the disaster is too severe for the remedy to be effective. We can only implore the government to show compassion for the need for rest and recuperation after the large-scale war and request that the counties that have suffered the most severe disasters be exempted from the Ding Cao miscellaneous taxes for 20 years, and the remaining disaster-stricken counties should be reported separately by the Provincial Government according to the severity of the disaster for delay in levy and quickly issue large amounts of money for emergency relief so that the people can have a little respite and be able to rebuild their lives. According to repeated appeals, disaster victim representatives such as He Chunjiang and others have sent telegrams calling for this association to be responsible for disaster relief in Shandong, and the information presented by the disaster victim representatives is factual. As the responsibility of this association is concerned, we cannot remain silent. We respectfully report and request that you issue a clear order to comply, etc. All the officials feel deeply concerned and regard the people as their own, caring for all things without discrimination. Seeing this severe disaster, they will surely extend their compassion and help, and jointly call for the allocation of funds for relief and advocate for the people. There is no limit to our prayers. We respectfully report and request that you wait for clear instruction. Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Relief Association, and Committee Members Li Shuchun, He Chunjiang, Zhao Xinru, Zhang Zicun, and Xin Jiujiu. Telegram from Jingdezhen: To all newspapers: Our division has been ordered to encircle and suppress the communist bandits. The advance troops of the Yang and Zhang brigades have made successive progress, recovering Cangwan City, Fuliang, Qiupu, Shimen Street, and Xima Bridge. On the 21st of this month, we recovered Jingdezhen. Our entire division also arrived on the 23rd, and the surrounding towns have been cleared. After investigating, Jingdezhen was occupied by bandits for two months and looted three times, leaving ten houses empty and killing over a thousand people, which is a truly tragic sight. Although our department has made every effort to restore order, the goods in all the shops have been emptied, and merchants from afar are afraid of dangers along the way and dare not trade hastily. Our department has now stationed troops on the land and water routes to and from Jingdezhen to ensure the safety of merchants and cargo transportation and ensure that there will be no accidents. We are deeply concerned that it may be difficult for various places to know about this in time and specifically request your newspaper to disclose this information so that commerce can be restored as soon as possible and the old appearance can be restored. 55th Division of the Army.</p>

<h3 id="e73">First Meeting of the National Government <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Appointing Wang Chonghui and Others as Members of the Consolidation Committee</p>
<p>Appointing Jiang Lufu as Representative to Negotiate Sino-Polish Treaty</p>
<p>The first meeting of the National Government on the 28th was attended by Committee Members Lin Sen, Wang Chonghui, Yu Youren, Zhu Peide, Hu Hanmin, Sun Ke, Chiang Kai-shek, Song Ziwen, and Zhang Xueliang. Chiang Kai-shek chaired the meeting.</p>
<p>Reported Matters: (1) The Central Political Council's letter stated that the Executive Committee had forwarded the proposal passed by the Fourth Plenary Session regarding refreshing the central politics, improving the system, consolidating discipline, and establishing a policy center in the shortest possible time to improve administrative efficiency. Clause 6 stipulated a deadline for implementing various laws and regulations regarding examinations and the strict implementation of qualifications and screening, and required all agencies to submit a detailed table of personnel advancements and retirements, as well as the number and salary of employees, every three months to the superior agency for review. If any agency submitted false information about the qualifications of employees or employed personnel beyond the quota, the chief official in charge should be punished. The 251st meeting of this council resolved to submit the case to the National Government and instructed the Examination Yuan to implement it on a regular basis and requested that the matter be separately forwarded to be observed and handled. The resolution was to handle it according to the report.</p>
<p>Matters for Discussion: (1) Resolved to amend the charter of the Internal and External Debt Consolidation Committee and specially appointed Wang Chonghui, Zhang Xueliang, Wang Zhengting, Kong Xiangxi, Sun Ke, Wang Boqun, and Song Ziwen as members, with Wang Chonghui concurrently serving as Chairman. (2) Resolved to appoint Jiang Lufu, the Chargé d'Affaires stationed in Italy, as the plenipotentiary representative to negotiate a Sino-Polish Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation. (3) Resolved to promulgate the Ship Law. (4) Resolved to promulgate the Ship Registration Law. (5) Resolved to amend and promulgate Article 6 of the Army University Organizational Law. (6) The Central Political Council's letter stated that the Executive Committee had forwarded the proposal passed by the Fourth Plenary Session regarding the refreshing of the central politics. Clause 8 stipulated a deadline for the establishment of a Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics directly under the National Government. All central agencies were required to complete the preparation of their organizational budgets for this accounting year, as well as the budgets within their jurisdiction, before the end of December, and local governments were required to complete them before March of the 20th year. These budgets should be submitted to the National Government for approval. Thereafter, the statements of revenue and expenditure of each agency, as well as supporting documents, must be prepared and submitted for audit in accordance with the law. Violators should be requested to punish or dismiss their chief officials in charge. If the auditing agency finds any expenditures that do not comply with legal procedures or evidence of fraud or overreporting after the audit, it should be submitted to the Control Yuan for handling. The 251st meeting of this council resolved to submit the case to the National Government, and the budget for the 20th year should be prepared before March of the 20th year in accordance with the trial budget regulations of the 19th year. The corresponding case should be recorded and communicated for reference and handling. The resolution was to handle it according to the report. (7) The Central Political Council's letter stated that the Executive Committee had forwarded the proposal passed by the Fourth Plenary Session regarding the refreshing of the central politics. Clause 7 of Item C stipulated the following guidelines for military rehabilitation: 1. Military rehabilitation includes the following tasks, to be completed within six months to one year: 1. Determination of the establishment and sufficiency of the number of troops. 2. Clearance of arrears in pay. 3. Elimination and resettlement of the old and weak. 4. Placement and accommodation of officers and soldiers beyond the quota. 5. Welfare of wounded and sick soldiers and care for officers and soldiers who died in battle. 6. Rewards for officers and soldiers who contributed during the war. 7. Determination of the soldiers' education and training plan and the initial national defense plan. 8. Establishment of garrison areas. 9. Closure of wartime agencies and clearance of the anti-rebellion military expenses. 10. Consolidation and replenishment of uniforms and military supplies. 2. The funds for military rehabilitation should be raised separately and should not interfere with the regular government expenses and military expenses budget. However, the construction of other active areas within this one-year period should be prioritized according to urgency and should not be carried out simultaneously. If various departments need to issue public debt due to construction projects, they should submit it to the political conference for review and approval, ensuring that it is truly necessary and urgent and does not affect public debt credit or increase the burden on the national treasury, and the Ministry of Finance should issue it uniformly. 3. The special funds raised for military rehabilitation should be managed by the central military and political agencies in conjunction with relevant groups to form a military rehabilitation special fund management committee. All income and expenditure should be publicly reported. The 251st meeting of this council resolved to submit the case to the National Government for reference and handling. The corresponding case should be recorded and submitted for reference and handling. The resolution was to handle it according to the report. (8) The Examination Yuan reported that after screening and reviewing the lowest-ranking appointed officials, those whose performance is rated as C should be demoted if there is no lower rank to be demoted to, the superior official in charge should be notified to consider changing them to probation or dismissing them and reporting it to the department for review. However, since this matter involves the interpretation and supplementation of laws and regulations, it should be submitted to the National Government for review and record and instructed to comply. The resolution was to submit it to the Legislative Yuan for interpretation.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Ministry of Foreign Affairs Broadcasts Recent Diplomatic Situation <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of the 28th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dispatched Bao Jing'an to the Central Broadcasting Station to report on the recent diplomatic situation. His statement was as follows: "Recently, in terms of diplomacy, because the country has been unified and the reactionary elements have been eliminated, the diplomatic attitude of various countries towards China has been refreshed from the past wait-and-see attitude, and they are prepared to continue negotiations with us on all issues. Considering that in recent days, the envoys of various countries stationed in China came from Beiping to Nanjing to participate in the National Government's victory celebration to suppress the rebellion, and the remarks made to the National Government after their return to Beiping, it can be proved that the attitude of various countries towards China has changed. Last month, British Foreign Secretary Henderson's speech in the Foreign Affairs Committee clearly stated that the British government is determined to fully accept all reasonable demands of China and recognizes that the existence of unequal treaties is inappropriate. The Japanese government has also issued a notice to abolish the term (支那) when referring to China. All these are sufficient to indicate that the prestige of the National Government is increasing day by day and the status of China in the international community is gradually improving. This can be comforting to the people of the country. Generally speaking, the diplomacy of any country must have the support of the entire people before it can be said to be victorious. The previous rebellion of Feng Yuxiang caused various countries to harbor a wait-and-see attitude, and all negotiations were once suspended. Now that China's unification has been completed, there should be significant progress in diplomacy thereafter. As for recent diplomatic events, there are several points that can be described separately below."</p>
<p>(1) Negotiations on Extraterritoriality: Regarding the issue of extraterritoriality, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently conducting negotiations separately with various countries. The negotiations between China and the United States are still being continued by Minister Wu, who is directly negotiating with the U.S. State Department. The U.S. proposal has now been sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is currently being carefully reviewed. The negotiations between China and Britain are still being handled by Foreign Minister Wang and British Minister Blue. As for the negotiations between China and France, they are currently being conducted by French Minister Wilden and Foreign Minister Wang. Issues such as the recovery of French rights in Guangzhou Bay and the Hankou Concession, as well as the reorganization of the Shanghai French Concession Mixed Court, have all been raised for discussion. Minister Wilden has telegraphed his government for instructions. Since the last negotiations between Foreign Minister Wang and Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu Mamoru in Nanjing, the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires has reported the situation of the negotiations to the Japanese government. Negotiations can continue once a reply is received. However, the issue of extraterritoriality is extremely important. It is still questionable whether Britain, France, the United States, and other countries can agree on the scope. The future is not optimistic, and the whole country must rise up in unison to support the government.</p>
<p>(2) Sino-Russian Negotiations: Since the official Sino-Russian conference opened on November 11th, the Russian side has insisted that the Khabarovsk Conference agreement is valid, while the Chinese side believes that the agreement has not been recognized by the central government and has been formally denied, making it difficult to recognize as valid. Therefore, the conference has made no progress. Representative Mo remains in Russia to proceed with the conference when the opportunity arises, and it has not broken down. Informal exchanges of views are still ongoing. It is hoped that the Russian side can realize this as soon as possible so that the conference can continue.</p>
<p>(3) Sino-Japanese Negotiations: The most important Sino-Japanese negotiation last month was the Longjingcun Incident. The newspapers have detailed the occurrence of the case. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now received a report that, as a result of active negotiations by our side, the Japanese police in Longjingcun were ordered by the Korean Governor-General on the 5th of this month to withdraw. Thus, the Longjingcun Incident has come to an end. Second, the Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiations have not made significant progress because the opinions of the two sides have not been fully aligned. As a result of informal exchanges of views between the two sides, there has been a gradual breakthrough, and consultations can continue soon.</p>
<p>(4) Recovery of Concessions and Leased Territories: The agreement to recover the Belgian Concession in Tianjin was signed in Tianjin on August 31st, 1929, and stipulated that it would be implemented after the exchange of instruments of ratification. The agreement was approved by the Chinese government on November 7th, 1929. Recently, the agreement has been formally passed by the Belgian Parliament, and the instruments of ratification will be sent soon. Once the two sides set a date for exchange, it will take effect, and the takeover can be scheduled at the same time. As for the Xiamen Gulangyu International Settlement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently working on it. Once preparations are completed, the recovery can be proposed to various countries.</p>
<p>(5) Treaty Negotiations: The treaty negotiations can be described separately below: (A) Sino-Persian Treaty of Commerce: The Sino-Persian treaty negotiations were entrusted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Jiang Lufu, the chargé d'affaires stationed in Italy, to conduct negotiations with the Persian envoy stationed in Italy. Recently, the Persian envoy stationed in Italy visited Chargé d'Affaires Jiang and said that he had been ordered by his government to open negotiations with China and had been issued full powers. After Chargé d'Affaires Jiang telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has submitted to the National Government for approval of the issuance of full powers, ordering Chargé d'Affaires Jiang to begin negotiations with the Persian envoy immediately. (B) Sino-Nicaraguan Agreement: It was found that Nicaragua imposed harsh laws on Chinese people. Before the event, Li Shizhong, the chargé d'affaires stationed in Panama, was appointed to be the consul-general stationed in Nicaragua to negotiate with the Nicaraguan government. Now, the two sides have agreed on twelve articles of the agreement on the treatment of Chinese people in Nicaragua based on the principle of automatic restriction. The general idea is that the Chinese government will restrict the number of overseas Chinese going to Nicaragua each year, while the Nicaraguan government will abolish the laws on Chinese immigrants, etc. The effective period is temporarily set at six years. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has applied to the National Government for the issuance of full powers for signing. Once the certificate is sent, the draft can be formally signed. (C) South Africa: The South African government has always treated overseas Chinese extremely harshly, with extremely strict restrictions on business and residence. Recently, in order to protect the overseas Chinese residing in South Africa, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared to sign a commercial treaty with the Federal Government of South Africa. It has now telegraphed He Zuan, the consul-general stationed in South Africa, to investigate which countries have signed commercial treaties with South Africa and to find out the contents of each treaty for reference as a basis for signing the treaty. At the same time, the consul-general stationed in South Africa was instructed to negotiate with the South African Ministry of Foreign Affairs on immigration and commercial affairs, but he was not bound until he received instructions from his own country. (D) Dominican Republic: Recently, the Dominican Republic envoy stationed in Cuba formally proposed to our country's envoy stationed in Cuba to negotiate a commercial treaty with our country. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed Ling, the envoy stationed in Cuba, to first investigate the number of overseas Chinese and the commercial situation, and then decide on a solution. (E) Sino-Czech Treaty: The instruments of ratification of the Sino-Czech Treaty of Amity and Commerce, after being approved by the National Government on April 25th of this year, were exchanged in Nanjing on the 20th of this month. According to the regulations, the treaty will take effect on the fifteenth day from the date of exchange, which means that the treaty will take effect on December 5th. According to the National Government, the first treaty of amity newly concluded with countries with which it had no treaty was the Sino-Hellenic Treaty of Amity, and the second was the Sino-Czech Treaty. (F) Sino-Italian Tariff Treaty: The instruments of ratification of the Sino-Italian Tariff Treaty, signed in Nanjing on December 19th, 1928, were exchanged in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 16th of this month by Foreign Minister Wang and Italian envoy Odenko. It was found that the treaties signed in 1928 had long been effective, except for the Sino-Italian Tariff Treaty, which had not taken effect because the instruments of ratification had not been exchanged. Now that the instruments of ratification of the Sino-Italian Treaty have been exchanged, China's tariff autonomy has been completely successful.</p>
<p>(6) Protecting Overseas Chinese: Regarding the negotiation to abolish the South Seas Dutch territories' increase in entry tax, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed the Dutch envoy stationed in China on September 13th, while Chargé d'Affaires Dai Mingfu directly raised the matter with the Dutch government. So far, there has been no progress. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that although the Dutch territories' preparation to increase the entry tax is said to be universal to the people of all countries, the number of Chinese people going to the Dutch territories is actually greater than that of other countries. The current tax amount is already a heavy burden, and it is impossible to increase it further. According to the spirit of friendship and the principle of reciprocity between the two countries, this should not be done. Therefore, based on this principle, a protest was lodged with the Dutch envoy on the 15th of this month, while Chargé d'Affaires Dai in the Dutch territories continued to protest to the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (7) Relocation of Embassies to the South: Since Nanjing is the capital, the embassies of various countries should be located in Nanjing. The relocation of embassies to the South was previously underway, but it was slightly frustrated due to changes in the situation. Now that the country has been unified, there is no need for the embassies to linger in Beiping. Recently, the envoys who came to the South also felt the need to relocate the embassies to Nanjing. The Fourth Plenary Session also passed the proposal of Foreign Minister Wang to allocate land for the construction of embassies of various countries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now working with all parties concerned to facilitate the early relocation of the embassies.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Yan Xishan's Preparation to Go Abroad <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Likely Still Decided to Go to Japan</p>
<p>Great Kindness Bestowed on Male and Female Relatives</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The issue of Mr. Yan Xishan going abroad has been confirmed. He is now actively preparing. The route he will take has also been discussed many times. Mr. Yan's aides have proposed taking either the Zhengtai Railway or the PingSui Railway. Mr. Yan said that no matter which route is taken, safety is the only standard. Mr. Yan has recently ordered his aides to collect his hand-compiled "People's Guide", "Village Head's Guide", and various books on village governance in preparation for taking them abroad. As for where he is going, based on recent observations, it is still mostly likely Japan. Mr. Yan also returned to his hometown this time to celebrate his mother's birthday. It is said that on the occasion of the birthday celebration, a large amount of rewards were given to Mr. Yan's relatives, such as widows among the female relatives, who were each rewarded with 80 yuan, unmarried women 40 yuan, and married women 60 yuan. In addition, there were extra rewards for male relatives. Mr. Yan said that he has seen through money as something external. In addition, the aides that Mr. Yan will take abroad this time have been determined, including Zhao Daiwen, Zhao Pilian, Jia Jingde, and Liang Ruzhou, among others, who are also packing their bags in preparation. Furthermore, Mr. Zhang Yinwu recently expressed to Mr. Yan that he intends to return to run a school, but Mr. Yan has not yet responded. (22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Fujian Government Borrowing Money from Xiamen Merchants <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The Process of Chen, He, and Shen Going to Xiamen</p>
<p>Whether Lu Xingming is Alive or Dead is Still Difficult to Determine</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Chen Peikun, He Gonggan, and Shen Qinmian went to Xiamen a few days ago to discuss borrowing money and reorganizing the salt affairs. Yesterday, the 21st, they suddenly returned to the province together. It is said that Chen originally intended to stay in Xiamen for a while, but he received a telegram from Chairman Yang urging him to return to the province due to the complexity of provincial affairs. Therefore, he only briefly communicated with various parties on the issue of salt surtax before leaving Xiamen to return to the province. He Gonggan met with representatives of the metal, seafood, and sugar taxes in Xiamen. He agreed to discuss the metal and sugar taxes at length, but he sternly rejected the request of Xiamen merchants to handle the seafood tax locally. As for how the borrowing of money went, there has been no news yet. Shen Qinmian's trip was to reorganize the salt affairs. On the 18th, he and Chen and He invited Wang Junxiu, the transport deputy, and advisors to the transport deputy office and directors of various salt affairs bureaus to hold a special meeting. Lin Guogeng, the commander of Xiamen, also attended. As a result, the income from the four downstream fields and the two bureaus in Xiamen was only more than 55,400 yuan per month. After allocating 38,000 yuan for the military expenses of Zhang Zhen's division, 25,000 yuan for the Xiamen Naval Command, and the expenses of the transport deputy office and various fields, the shortfall was resolved by merging the various fields in accordance with provincial regulations and reducing the assessment of various fields. Therefore, the expenses of the transport deputy office, various fields, bureau audit offices were reduced by a total of 8,800 yuan, which was still 4,000 yuan short, which was covered by the special finance office. Yang Shuzhuang led Lin Zhiyuan, Zheng Shijing, and five others to Nanjing a few days ago. In addition to reporting the experience of being detained by Lu Xingbang, Lin and others unanimously agreed on the matter of bailing out Lu Xingming. However, it is recently rumored here that Lu Xingming committed suicide by poisoning himself after being transferred to the Hangzhou Army Prison. The provincial government's personnel stationed in Shanghai also have the same report. However, it is believed here that Lu may not be willing to commit suicide, and there are other reasons. On the other hand, it is said that Yang Shuzhuang telegraphed the provincial government on the 20th, relaying Lu Xingbang's message that Xingming has been released by the Zhejiang government by order of Chairman Chiang. Lu's life and death issue is still difficult to predict for a while. (November 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Decline of Bandits and Communists in Various Districts of Chaozhou and Meizhou <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Garrison Troops Launch Large-Scale Suppression Operations</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The 62nd Division of the Garrison Troops in Chaozhou and Shantou, commanded by Xiang Hanping, has been ordered to suppress the communist bandits. The remnants of the 11th Army of the communist bandits in the upper and lower reaches of the Han River, led by Gu Dacun, have gradually been eliminated, and there are no large groups of communist bandits appearing. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Meixian Area: Huang Chengdian, the commander of the Special Service Battalion, sent troops to search for bandits in Luoyibao Angge, killing nine bandits and the rest fleeing to Nankeng. Li Siyi, the chairman of Jiuxiang who was attached to the bandits, and two local people Liu Limei and Liu Abing were captured. For several days, refugees from the bandit areas in Shunli, Da'ao, Xiaosu, and Shedu in the upper reaches of the Mei River have requested to surrender, numbering about a thousand. The organs of the bandit party have moved into Fengshun. Huang's battalion cooperated with the military police stationed at Matoushan to search the bandit nests in Huang Nili, Fengshun. They found the bandit party's puppet government and hospital organs. When the military police arrived, the bandit party fled into the deep mountains and forests. Two bandits were killed on the spot, and male bandit Yu Yashuang and female bandit Ruizhen were captured alive. Three seals of the Military Commission and the Red Guards and more than 20 small seals from various districts and villages were seized. Since the military police entered the area, more than 2,000 men and women have requested to surrender to the military police. Ma Yi, the commander of the Second Battalion, went to Jiulongzhang via Shuiche Xiaosang to suppress the bandits. He searched the bandit nests in Shiziling, Wanheshan, and Guaihushan, capturing 11 members of the bandit party and a seal of the puppet government of the Fifth Township of the Second District. Ma's battalion burned the jungles.</p>
<p>Fengshun Area: Kong Kequan's regiment has been suppressing the communist bandits for days. Guided by Zhu Dabang, a communist bandit who surrendered, they have captured dozens of people, including Li Pengji. Fifteen people were executed by shooting on the 11th. Kong's regiment commander and the county magistrate, in order to cut off the food supply of the communist bandits, dispatched military police to protect the people to cut the rice in the bandit area. On November 5, they first went to Dazhan, Yangweilong, Kengzili, Shangwuguo, Shanzixia, and Anzili to cut rice, with about 3,000 people attending. On the 6th, they went to Buxin to cut rice, with about 4,000 people participating. On the 7th, they went to Shankengwei, with about 5,000 people participating in the harvesting. On the 9th and 10th, the military police cooperated with 6,000 people to cut rice in the bandit areas of Yinyangao, Da'ao, and Shankengwei. They also unearthed countless rice grains stored by the communist bandits in Shihuangqi Jiaogongding. All the mountains and forests and houses where bandits could gather were set on fire. On the 13th, the military police cut all the rice fields in the bandit area and escorted them back to the county seat. From then on, the communist bandits had no food and could not stay in the mountains and forests for long.</p>
<p>Raoping and Dapu Areas: The people of Chishui Township in Dapu have awakened and risen up against the communists, requesting to surrender to the Gaobo Joint Defense Office, willing to serve as guides for suppressing the bandits. On the 11th, several hundred bandits gathered in Hecun. The county magistrate of Liang cooperated with Huang Chao's battalion to suppress them. From dawn to noon, the communist bandits were defeated and retreated to Xiashan. Dozens of bandits were killed and dozens of guns were captured in this battle. On the 14th, they began to return to the county. On the 15th, the bandits crossed the mountains of Shangxiashan and crossed Raoping Jiucun. The police team of Shangrao was weak and retreated, and Taoyuan Village and Raoping City were therefore under martial law.</p>
<p>Pingyuan Area: More than 1,000 communist bandits occupied Niudougang. The First Battalion of the Chen Ju Regiment stationed in Pingyuan cooperated with the Xunping police team to suppress them. When they arrived at Changchating Guanlaiba, they came into contact with more than 100 bandit sentries. The military police divided into three routes to encircle and advance. Five miles away from the market, a great battle took place and the bandits collapsed and retreated to Chetou. More than 10 bandits were killed on the spot. On the 14th, Niudougang was captured.</p>
<p>Puning Area: The instructor of the Jiaodao Regiment, Jin Ying, sent Yang Guoqiang's battalion to Guibei Village, Puning, to suppress the bandits. On the afternoon of the 9th, they met the 49th regiment of bandits outside the village. The bandit army, about 400 people, spoke Xiang and Yue dialects and were holding a meeting in the open space. Yang's battalion attacked the bandits, and after an hour of fierce fighting, the bandits were defeated and fled into the mountains on the left and right. Traces of blood were visible along the way, and 40 bandit corpses were left behind, one of whom was dressed as an officer. Luo Tuan telegraphed Shantou on the 10th to report the victory.</p>
<p>Hailufeng Area: The replenishment regiment reported by telegraph that its unit had destroyed the communist bandit organization in Baimanghua, Haifeng, killing 26 bandits and wounding dozens of others. Important documents and grain were captured. It was rumored that the bandits were holding a representative meeting of the three provinces of Min, Yue, and Gan, and were about to carry out violent riots in Zijing, Haifeng, and were coercing the villagers to join in providing food and supplies. After the bandits were defeated by Luo Tuan, most of them fled to Xianzhou, and a small number fled to Kenlai. (November 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e78">General Outline of the Four-Way Settlement Method <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The conference on clearing vehicles on the Tianjin-Jiaoji, Longhai, and Pinghan Railways decided that the standard for clearing vehicles on each railway should be based on the military transport period from February 23 to November 15. The conference then announced the end of the conference. The situation has been recorded in previous letters. It is now known that the Tianjin-Longhai Railway will settle in Xuzhou. The settlement method will be determined by representatives of the two railways outside the conference. The Tianjin-Jiaoji Railway will settle in Jinan. The two parties have already decided on the method: (1) The Jiaoji and Jinpu Railways will submit a list of locomotives and vehicles that have passed through the Jinan Station. After the two parties have verified and signed without error, it will be used as the basis for clearing the handover. If there is a discrepancy in a part of the list between the two parties, the verified part will be processed first, and the rest will be verified by the Jiaoji and Jinpu Railways at Jinan Station based on the track transfer book before processing. (2) The original railway will send personnel to the factories and stations of the related railways to conduct on-site investigations together. If a locomotive or vehicle in the list of the previous item is found, the relationship railway bureau should be immediately notified and telegraphed for approval. The railway in charge nearby will be responsible for sending it to the connecting station and handle the handover of vehicles in accordance with the procedures. If it needs to pass through more than two railways, the middle railway will be responsible for transferring it so that the original railway can count the number of vehicles. If it is found that the locomotive or vehicle is occupied by the military, the relevant railway should telegraph the bureau to negotiate for its release and return to the original railway. (3) The personnel dispatched by the original railway should be given full assistance by the railway where they are located during the investigation period. (4) If there is any question, personnel from the directly related railways should be dispatched together to investigate the truth in the various sections and stations of the railway where they are located. The Longhai and Pinghan Railways will also decide on the method of settlement in Zhengzhou: (1) Each railway will send one person to settle in Zhengzhou. The Pinghan Railway will send Jin Zhongxun, the chief of the vehicle affairs study section, and the Longhai Railway will send Qing Xinjia, the chief of the vehicle affairs section. (2) The number of passenger vehicles, the number of freight vehicles, the tonnage, and the vehicle numbers recorded in the track transfer form signed by both parties will be cleared. (3) After the settlement is completed, the personnel dispatched by both parties should jointly make a report on the settlement results, sign it together, and each hold a copy to report to the railway bureau, and then each railway bureau will report it to the Ministry of Communications by telegram. (4) The railway that owes vehicles should return the difference in the comparison obtained from the settlement in full. If there are military personnel detained, the railway bureau where they are located should telegram the Ministry of Communications to find a way to negotiate for their release. Now that the representatives of each railway have returned to the railway to report, the Tianjin-Jiaoji Railway will settle in Jinan, and the Longhai and Pinghan Railways will also settle in Zhengzhou. However, the detailed settlement methods of the Tianjin-Longhai Railways still need to be negotiated. However, the disputes on the four railways can be resolved here.</p>

<p>Cai Lizheng Handles Post-Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The residents of Linbian and Baishan areas in the northwest of Suxian County, northern Anhui, were greatly ravaged by the remnant soldiers of Sun Dianying's troop. Just as the troops and militias of Suxian and Yongcheng were planning to advance together, the bandits in Cai Li and Suixi areas of Suxian were also suppressed by the Suxian Garrison and the People's Self-Defense Corps of each district. The bandit leaders Zhang Chuanwen, Wang Degong, Wang Kunlun, San Mao Hou, and Zhou Hanzi, seeing that the situation was not good, split into two groups and fled east and west. Those who fled east joined forces with Wang Xiaoting's bandits in the Jiagou area of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and spread to the areas of Luding and Guigu. Those who fled west joined forces with Zhang Baoguo's remnant soldiers of Sun Dianying's troop, totaling about six or seven hundred men, more than 20 horses, and armed with more than 40 machine guns and hundreds of rifles. Soon after, a giant bandit Xiao Hongao led a group to join, totaling more than a thousand people, occupying the Li Kouji and Chen Laolou areas of Linbian and Baishan. A few days ago, the troops and militias of Suxian, Yongcheng, and Xiao counties pursued them from Cai Li. The fleeing soldiers and bandits also joined forces and fled westward, attempting to invade Yongcheng. They were intercepted head-on by the garrison troops stationed in Yongcheng. The fleeing soldiers and bandits then turned to the junction of Suxiao and Xiaoxian counties. The troops and militias of the three counties are still tracking and pursuing in order to annihilate them in the shortest possible time. The bandits in Cai Li and Suixi have been dispersed. The authorities have sent troops to garrison Cai Li and are now clearing the remaining bandits and handling local post-disaster relief. (27th)</p>

<p>Five Robberies Occurred in Xixiang: In the Xixiang 17th District (Fuan Township), at Shaotangying, the previous night, Gao Zhaosheng, a villager from near Xueyan Bridge, was returning home from the city by rented boat when he was suddenly shot and killed by robbers. On the same night, near the Qian She Bangkou in the same township, there was a rice boat from Yixing that had docked. Around 10 p.m., five or six robbers suddenly jumped down from the shore. They were all wearing tattered gray military uniforms, each armed with long guns, box cannons, and other fierce weapons. They overturned the cabin and thoroughly searched the boat, but fortunately, the rice on the boat had not yet been sold, so the losses were minimal. At about 11 p.m. that night, at a place less than a mile away from Shaotangying, the home of a tenant named Hu Aju was attacked by robbers who used huge stones to break down the door. They stole dozens of items of men's and women's clothing and more than ten silver dollars. The victim, Hu Aju, was also injured in the shoulders and back by the robbers' gun butts. Unexpectedly, at 12 p.m. that night, the robbers sneaked into Jingtingli, near that same place, and robbed the home of villager Zhang Awu, taking clothes, silver dollars, and other items totaling several hundred yuan. Before leaving, they shot and killed the owner's dog. The robbers, still unsatisfied after robbing Jingtingli, went to the Dabatou area of Qianqiao in the 4th District (Kaiyuan Township) with their guns and successively robbed the homes of villagers Xu Daen and Gu Laoer, looting more than ten silver dollars, 2,000 copper coins, and many items of clothing.</p>
<p>Using Mud and Copper Coins to Deceive and Obtain Goods: The other day, Ji Renyuan Hat and Shoe Store at Chong'an Temple, Tongyixing Umbrella Store outside Dongmen Tingzi Bridge, and a small foreign goods store at Jieguan Tingkou were all visited by a man who purchased shoes, umbrellas, foreign goods, etc. He placed what looked like thousands of copper coins and four or five packets of mud on the counter, claiming that he would take the goods to look at them and return shortly. He never came back. The stores opened the copper coins and discovered that they were mud, realizing that they had been deceived and were very upset. Furthermore, Wang Xiaolin, a resident of Houbeijie outside the North Gate, because his wife, Li, was not recovering from her illness, summoned a fortune teller, a certain Jia, to his home yesterday afternoon to calculate her horoscope. Jia saw that Li was wearing three gold rings on her hand and, believing that there was profit to be made, spoke nonsense, saying that the woman's annual fortune was bad and that she needed to ward off evil stars. Li believed him and asked him to ward them off. Jia ordered Li to take off the three gold rings and put them in a cigarette can, and instructed Li to light incense, light candles, and kowtow in worship. During this time, Jia took the opportunity to leave. Afterwards, Li opened the cigarette can and discovered that the three gold rings had disappeared without a trace.</p>

<p>Suqian County Magistrate Punished for Smoking: The former Suqian County Magistrate Xinshan was previously reported to the provincial department for smoking opium. The Department of Civil Affairs ordered the magistrate to come to the province to undergo testing. After it was confirmed that he was smoking opium, Director Hu believed that as the county magistrate, he was the leader of the county and a mentor to the people, and he should set an example in rectifying the local area. However, he was smoking opium, which would delay important official duties. There was no excuse for this, so Cui was severely punished by the court to serve as a warning to others and to maintain the opium ban. A Large Number of Communist Bandits Escorted from Lianshui to the Province: Recently, the communist bandits in Lianshui County have been increasingly active, so the military and police organs in the area have been strengthening their defenses.

<p>Methods for Converting Public Funds and Copper Coins into Silver Dollars: The public funds for education and charity in Nantong, which are deposited in pawnshops and money shops to generate interest, are substantial. In recent years, there have been many disputes over the conversion of copper coins into silver dollars. On the 27th, the county government invited representatives from all walks of life to the Real Estate Management Office to mediate. It was decided that the principal would be converted at 1,600 copper coins per silver dollar, and the unpaid interest for five years would be converted at 1,800 copper coins per silver dollar. The county case was thus resolved.</p>

<p>Household Survey Meeting: The county government convened a household survey meeting on the morning of the 26th and resolved the following important issues: (1) The Household Survey Office must complete this survey within one month. It was resolved that the survey must be completed within the time limit (the survey period is before December 15th, and the total number of male and female households must be reported within 20 days, and the forms must be prepared and sent to the county government by December 25th for forwarding). (1) It was resolved that the urban area survey should be completed within one day. (1) It was resolved that the expenses for the household survey should be set at 1,400 yuan, with a budget prepared and submitted to the province. Of this, 80 yuan will be retained by the county for office use, and the remaining 1,320 yuan will be distributed to the Bing and Ding districts for distribution (100 yuan per district in the Bing group and 84 yuan per district in the Ding group).</p>
<p>Meeting to Solicit Construction Bonds: The county government's Finance Bureau convened a meeting of district chiefs, local gentry, and merchants on the afternoon of the 26th to solicit subscriptions for construction bonds. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Half of the construction bonds will be solicited first, with subscriptions paid in three installments. The remaining half will be jointly requested by the county bureau to be reduced. (1) Method of distribution of half of the bonds: the urban area will be responsible for 30%, and the rural area will be responsible for 70%. The urban area will be assigned 9,000 yuan, and the rural area will be assigned 21,000 yuan. Each Bing district in the rural area should subscribe 2,000 yuan, and each Ding district should subscribe 1,000 yuan. Because five or six of the Bing districts are bandit areas, each will be reduced by 1,000 yuan. The remaining 2,000 yuan will still be borne by the urban area (30%) and the rural area (70%). The urban area will add 600 yuan, totaling 9,600 yuan. The rural area's 70% will be divided among the Ding districts, with each Ding district subscribing 1,300 yuan.</p>
<p>A Young Woman Commits Suicide Out of Shame After an Attempted Rape: Shi, the daughter-in-law of Chu Chenglang in Lihua Township, Third District, was 22 years old. Her husband went to Suzhou to sell ducks and had not returned. On the night of the 21st, Lu Fugen, a local hooligan, broke into her room late at night with the intention of committing rape and snatched Shi's cotton pants. On the 22nd, she committed suicide behind the Chucao Port Tearoom. After mediation, Lu Fugen paid ten yuan, with six yuan going to the Chucao Port for expenses and the remaining four yuan given to Shi as travel expenses. Someone laughed at her for getting four yuan for one night. Shi felt deeply ashamed and committed suicide at home yesterday. Lu Fugen, the culprit, had already heard the news and fled. Only his father, Ao Guan, was apprehended. Yesterday afternoon, he reported to the Third District Public Office. District Chief Xu was in the city on official business and, after receiving a telegram, immediately presented the case to the county magistrate and requested that a coroner be sent to investigate.</p>

<p>Tragic Jealousy Incident: In Yangzhuang, Fanchuan Town, the county seat, a man named Yang Changhai married a woman from a neighboring village named Xiao Cuizi the other day (the 25th). Because the woman was somewhat beautiful, she had an affair with Wang Xiaowuzi, a local rogue. Wang's marriage proposal was unsuccessful. On the day the woman was married, he disguised himself as a sedan carrier and insisted on carrying the wedding sedan to Yang's house. When night fell, Wang sneaked into the room, pulled out a short knife, stabbed Yang in the lower part, and cut off the woman's nipple. When neighbors heard calls for help and came to the rescue, they saw that Yang and the woman had lost consciousness due to excessive bleeding. Wang, having achieved his goal, fled without a trace.</p>

<p>Another Bandit Alarm Outside the City: On the evening of the 23rd, Cao Shizhi and his wife, Meng, were in their Caoshunxing Iron Shop on Hebei Street in Xiaoshuimen when two bandits suddenly entered and asked Cao Shizhi to buy an axe. Shizhi asked his four-year-old son, Da Heshang, to pass the message and turned to get an axe. The bandits, seeing that there was no one else around, grabbed Meng's son and threatened her with a pistol, ordering her not to make a sound. Meng resisted, and they grappled to the door of the shop. The bandits pushed Meng to the ground and then fled along Yilou Lane on the north side of Cao's opposite street. By the time the police and local security forces arrived to pursue them, the bandits had already escaped far away through a gap in the dike north of the bus station. The police are still searching for them.</p>
<p>The Police Chief Pursues Recovery of Food Expenses: Zhao Zhenhua, the chief of the Huaiyin Public Security Bureau, had deducted five corners from the salary of each police chief starting in March of this year for food expenses. Over the months, the total amount saved was over 300 yuan. Zhao has been accused of wrongdoing, dismissed from his post, and detained in the county government. The new director, Zhu Ying, appointed by the Department, will arrive in Huai soon to take over. The police chiefs are deeply afraid that the money will be lost during the transition between the old and new administrations, so they collectively demanded the recovery of the funds from Acting Director Zhang Shouqian on the 23rd. Zhang stated that the matter was handled by Zhao and that he was not involved. He requested instructions from the county government, which ordered the chiefs to submit a roster with the names and number of police chiefs.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, I am writing in response to an article in the Local Communications section of your newspaper on November 27 entitled "(Strike at Nanhui County Middle School)," which is completely unfounded and lacks any factual basis. The tuition fees for the Normal School were determined by the Education Bureau during the registration period, and there were no problems with payment during registration. The so-called strike is even more baseless. This letter is specifically to request a correction.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, I am writing in response to a local communication from Rugao in your newspaper on the 28th of this month, which stated that Guo, the captain of the detective team dispatched by the Rugao County Government, had captured a notorious bandit named Li Zhongru at the Changyuan Pig Company in the 16th Pier. After investigation, there is no such person as Li Zhongru in our company. There is only a pig merchant named Ding Xiaolan's son, Ding Xiaofu, who was recently harassed by five or six unidentified hooligans who demanded money at the Yuebin Hotel. The district office escorted them to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which transferred them to the local court for interrogation. We are afraid that the rumor is inaccurate and confusing to the public, so we specifically request that your newspaper publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section to clarify the facts. Sincerely, Changyuan Pig Company</p>

<p>Ginling Women's College in the capital was founded in the autumn of the 4th year of the Republic of China and has now been around for 15 years. At the beginning of the school year, there were eight faculty members and only nine students. Later, the number of students increased, and the original school buildings were no longer sufficient. Therefore, in the autumn of the 12th year, a new school building was built in Taogu near Qingliang Mountain, covering an area of more than 250 acres. The buildings were connected to the clouds and the atmosphere was rejuvenating. The equipment was greatly expanded, and the number of students increased sharply. In the autumn of the 17th year, the board of directors elected Dr. Wu Yifang to succeed the American Mrs. Deborah Duncan, who was also the first graduate of the school. From the 8th to the 19th year of the Republic of China, a total of 170 students graduated from the university. Their service locations (north to 　Ning, south to Yunnan, west to Sichuan) cover more than ten provinces. Most of them are engaged in education, accounting for 60%. Those who are engaged in specialized academic research at home and abroad account for about 14%. Last autumn, a physical education program was added and 30 students graduated this summer, and they were assigned to physical education instruction. According to recent statistics, the current students represent more than ten provinces, and the women's middle schools they represent are about 60 in number. There is a scene of lush prosperity. It is reported that the school board has been approved by the Ministry of Education to be registered. The registration procedures for the school itself can be completed soon. The school name will be changed to Ginling College of Arts and Sciences, which is still a university organization. All Coelges should be called colleges. The English name will remain Ginling College. It is learned that the school is scheduled to hold a 15th-anniversary entertainment party this Saturday evening and has sent out invitations to people from all walks of life to visit. The program is as follows: (1) English drama (2) Kun Opera (Sweeping Flowers) 3) Mandarin Drama (Old Flames, New Light). In addition, there are also copper piano ensembles, Pipa solos, and Chinese music ensembles.</p>

Next, Ding _, the Director of General Affairs and Dean of Academic Affairs, delivered a speech, saying, "Human life has two kinds of needs: one is specificity, that is, the development of science, and the other is spirit, which relies on art.

Now the government is supporting schools in science, and I hope that in the future, it will also support art schools so that they can cultivate artistic talents and achieve spiritual perfection." Next, Xu Yefu, the representative of the city party headquarters, delivered a speech, saying, "How many art colleges in Shanghai have a 19-year history? How many Chinese art talents have a 19-year history? It can be said that besides your school, there is none. This is worth commemorating. Art is pure and great. How many of the 400 million compatriots in our country understand art? Your school has a 19-year history in such an environment where it is not understood by the public. This is worth commemorating. Your school has a 19-year history, and you must not be satisfied with the achievements of these ten years and make progress every day. You should work harder in the future." Next, Zhang Meisun, the representative of the municipal government's education bureau, Cai Yuanpei, the representative of the school board, and guests Ge Gongzhen and Xu Zhimo gave speeches.

The chairman was Pan Gongzhan, and the judges were Chen Tingrui, Gao Yihan, Jiang Wenyu, and He Bingsong. The debate topic was (The existing universities in Shanghai should find ways to merge into a large-scale university). The Fudan representatives were students Peng Qixin, Chen _ Sheng, and He Dehe. The Jinan representatives were students Ma Xingqian, Zhao Fengqi, and Zhang Guoquan. The Fudan representatives spoke from the positive side of the topic, and the Jinan representatives spoke from the negative side. Both sides debated eloquently, like a river flowing, with sharp tongues and fierce arguments. The audience of over a thousand people applauded and laughed. As a result, although the three Jinan representatives' debates from theoretical and factual aspects were also admirable and praised as rare, they were slightly inferior to Fudan. Therefore, Fudan won.</p>

<p>Hujiang Middle School's combat strength was weaker than before due to the injury and absence of the strong player Dai Linzhen. However, it was the result of its hard work to create an advantage of 9 to 7 in the first half. Its sharp spirit suddenly fell in the second half, so it could not be cleaned up with one defeat.

<p>At the beginning of the Lao Da vs. Pirates battle, it was quite flustered, and there was nothing brilliant in terms of attack and defense. Therefore, at that time, the Pirates' spirit was invincible. They once led by 6 to 1, 12 to 7. Lao Da suddenly changed the lineup, and in a flash, the atmosphere changed drastically, turning defense into attack, and the situation improved. Lin scored two consecutive goals, plus Yang's penalty shot, creating a 12-point tie. Fortunately, Hua Shi's goal allowed the Pirates to lead 14 to 12 in the first half. In the sound of the restart of the war, the Pirates also tried their best to develop, and center Hua Shi was the most outstanding. Before long, they led by 19 to 14. The entire Lao Da team fought hard, and Yang's two-man record was particularly impressive. Soon, they tied again at 19 and 27, and finally ended the game at 29. It was overtime, and Lao Da went through wind and waves and was safe and sound. At that time, their spirit was greatly boosted, and they beat the Pirates to pieces. In the end, they won 39 to 34.

<p>McLaughlin's combat strategy changed unpredictably, and there was a sense of looking at it with new eyes after three days of separation. Chi Zhi initially had an aura of 9 to 4, but suddenly, McLaughlin was like a dragon and a tiger. The defense was tight, and the throws were accurate. Chi Zhi _ was at a loss to deal with it and fell to a low ebb. When McLaughlin was at 20 to 11, Yang Linyu recovered a goal. In the first half, McLaughlin led with 20 to 13. In the second half, Kong Yuan's throws were unlucky and were added 4 points by McLaughlin. Kong shot from a distance again and again, and both times hit. Chi Zhi gradually became optimistic because of this. Kong added 3 goals, Wei 2 goals, and Liu 1 goal, and suddenly it became 24. At that time, the tension of the air and the thoroughness of the war were indescribable. Unexpectedly, McLaughlin made its last struggle and unexpectedly made a big move. This time, Chi Zhi's counter-attack was ineffective and finally lost 25 to 38. Referee: Xu Zhendong.</p>

<h3 id="e124">This City's Supervisory Committee Urges All Comrades <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Hoping Comrades Will Polish Their Moral Integrity and Character</p>
<p>To Cultivate Superior Personalities and Serve as Exemplars for the People</p>
<p>This city's Supervisory Committee held its 23rd regular meeting at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 27th). Those present included Wang Yansong, Chen Xizeng, Deng Tongwei, Zhu Yingpeng, and Jiang Huaishu. The standing committee elected Wang Yansong as chairman and Chen Bai as recorder. Many important cases were decided and assigned separately. Furthermore, the standing committee proposed that in the past, members of our party have often been criticized by society for their inappropriate behavior. Since the central authorities have repeatedly issued warnings, and the Fourth Plenary Session has issued a solemn instruction, it seems appropriate for this committee to reiterate the intent and urge all comrades in the city to consider whether this is appropriate, and to submit a draft letter of advice to all comrades in the city for public decision. The resolution was passed, and it was decided that it should be published immediately to all district party branches, so that all comrades can take note and be inspired.</p>
<p>Letter of Advice to All Comrades in the City: The military campaign against the rebels has been completed. The central authorities, concerned about whether the life and principles of our party can be realized, see that everything depends on whether the party's work can be intensified and advanced in the future. Therefore, the Fourth Plenary Session was convened to plan the reorganization and reform of fundamental issues. Regarding party affairs, the first priority is to determine the restructuring of party organization in order to seek unified decision-making and guidance over party affairs, to strengthen its organization and enrich its power, and to effectively avoid the past situation of division of labor leading to decentralization, and the alienation caused by decentralization. Secondly, the targets and key points of party work are now defined, so as to deeply plant the party's foundation in various social undertakings and organizations, to enhance the people's use of the four powers and the development of various social undertakings, and to integrate the party's principles with the national education system, so as to guide the youth of the country, both male and female, on the path of the Three Principles of the People, and to earnestly promote, guide and supervise the local people to engage in local self-government, so as to plant the foundation of democratic government. All planning is thorough and sufficient to serve as the guideline for all comrades in the future. Furthermore, the session earnestly exhorted all party comrades to point out the past misunderstandings among comrades regarding the party, the party headquarters, and the people, to identify the true and unsound points, and to show the way to understanding and self-cultivation, so that all party comrades can each reflect on themselves and correct each other. The sincere and earnest words are sufficient to make comrades deeply alert and strive to act without disgracing themselves. Our party's mission to advocate for national revolution lies in thoroughly eliminating the remnants of the feudal system and implementing the construction of the Three Principles of the People created by the late Premier Sun, in order to achieve the freedom, equality, independence, and liberation of the Chinese nation and state. Establishing this goal as a forerunner for the people, we were able to gather virtuous, talented, and wise individuals to jointly face decades of hardship and create a foundation relying on the struggle and sacrifice of the martyrs. In the end, we were able to</p>
<p>destroy the feudal forces and unify the hearts of the people. This was no accident. However, in the two years since the completion of the Northern Expedition, rebellious warlords have multiplied, and the communist bandits and vagrants have wandered aimlessly. The foundation of national interest and people's welfare has not been firmly established to increase the people's faith in the party. Moreover, those who seek personal gain have even infiltrated this party and recklessly committed injustice, hiding as a scourge among the people, thereby causing the people to develop antagonism towards the party, which obstructs the progress of the national revolution. This is truly lamentable. The late Premier Sun said, "Everyone should aim to serve, not to seize." He also said, "Individuals have no freedom, only the party has freedom." This has long been upheld by all party comrades.</p>
<p>Comrades</p>
<p>join this party and engage in national revolution with firm belief</p>
<p>and noble aspirations. Having devoted themselves to this blue and white banner, they should even more diligently learn from each other's mistakes, strive to follow the example of the martyrs, and promote the spirit of sacrificing oneself to benefit the people. From beginning to end, everyone should strive to enrich their intelligence, talent, and character to become a model for society, and further contribute their intelligence, talent, and character to this party, so that our party can utilize the great power accumulated by the intelligence, talent, and character of all party members to accomplish the task of implementing the Three Principles of the People. In the past, those who sought opportunities for personal gain were deluded by the delusion of individualism or even used the party for personal gain. Their actions were dissolute and extravagant, deviating from the likes and dislikes of society and the people. Their character deteriorated to an unfathomable extent, causing the people to not only fail to respect them but also lose sympathy and regard them with disdain, as if they were a privileged class disliked by society. This false association extends to the entire party, distancing it from the people, losing the ability to unite, guide, and fight together. With such party members, the party's reputation is damaged day by day, the party's foundation cannot be consolidated, and the national revolution suffers immense damage. How dangerous it is! Now that these unworthy party members have been gradually eliminated, and the bad habits and malpractices will also be cleared away, our loyal comrades should at this time especially exert themselves to extricate themselves from past humiliation and resolve this great crisis, and revive the revolutionary nature of the party. The central authorities' exhortations to all party comrades, urging them to be loyal and strive forward, are particularly sincere and profound. Our comrades, recognizing the weight of their own responsibilities and positions, should have a genuine understanding and seek to devote themselves to the party. This committee bears the heavy responsibility entrusted by all comrades in the city, and its earnest hope for all comrades in the city is to advance together. It is believed that our party bears the great responsibility of the national revolution, and it relies on the contributions of comrades, whose intelligence and talent can be combined to form a great force. What is urgently needed is for comrades to cultivate their personalities in order to establish their achievements. Therefore, what is expected of comrades day and night lies in polishing their moral integrity and character. Since we are endowed with intelligence and talent, we must also have a noble and pure personality in order to be the cornerstone for the success of great undertakings. If all party comrades can fully use their special intelligence</p>
<p>and unique personalities to distinguish themselves, uphold the party's mission, be cautious and self-disciplined, diligent, courageous, loyal, and trustworthy, earnestly adhere to the principles, endure hardships more than others, abide by the law and serve the public, work diligently and responsibly, enlighten the people's wisdom, assist the people's rights, and show the spirit of sacrificing the small self to fulfill the greater self, then party members will surely be respected and admired by the people, and they will be worthy of being models for the people. The party will surely gain the greatest faith and support from the people, and all measures taken can be directed towards success. The central authorities' admonishments to our comrades are thorough and detailed, and there is no need for this committee to reiterate them. The reason for saying it again is that the comrades in this city have already demonstrated a long and valuable history of fighting for the revolution, and the city is located in a crucial position, where all eyes are focused. The party's revolutionary responsibility borne by our comrades is even heavier and greater. Their words and actions are always watched by the people and are related to the progress of the party's future. Our comrades should know that they must first correct themselves before they can lead others, and they should be even more cautious and fearful, constantly reflecting on themselves, examining themselves, striving for self-improvement, and constantly renewing themselves, maintaining a glorious history, and striving to be models for the people, so as not to disgrace the party's mission. The task of building a great cause is heavy and the road is long. Let us strive together with all comrades in the city. Shanghai Special Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, November of the 19th year.</p>

The cotton industry group will assist the economic survey group in investigating the state of the cotton goods industry and report on methods of revitalization. The main areas of inspection in China are Shanghai, Hankou, and North China to Manchuria. In South China, Guangzhou is the center. As for its motivation, although the current situation in China is unstable, its import trade is increasing year by year. Britain has not occupied an appropriate position in this progress, and it has generally deteriorated since 1913. According to the report of Peel, a special committee member of the British Overseas Commercial Development Association, in 1913, Britain accounted for 17% of China's total import trade. In 1929, it fell to 9%, while China's import trade doubled between 1923 and 1929. In contrast, US trade with China increased by 6% in 1913 and by 17% in 1929. Japan also increased by 20% to 26%. Germany's trade with China also doubled after the European War. Therefore, the main task of the British Far East Economic Survey Group is to advise the London government on remedial measures after returning to the country.</p>

<p>Requesting Compatriots to Refuse Hospitality</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese from the British and Dutch Colonies of Southeast Asia, who were expelled, organized the Support Association for the Promotion of National Diplomacy in Nanjing. The Shanghai community held an Aid Xiao Anti-Dutch General Assembly the other day. Three representatives, Liao Peizhi, Luo Ciqi, and Feng Hanyue, were specially sent to Shanghai to participate. Now that the British Far East Economic Survey Group will arrive in Shanghai during the day, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, are preparing to receive the representatives who have suffered the devastation and abuse of British imperialism. They are extremely dissatisfied with this and have formulated a declaration. Together with Mr. Zhuo Wuchu, the executive of the Overseas Chinese Federation, they took a car to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Fenglin Bridge yesterday afternoon. The director of the office, Chen Shiguang, and Liu Yunfang, were not there. Yan Zhaosheng received them. Next, they went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. Director Pan was also not in the bureau. Xu Jisan and Mo Qiang received them. Zhao Jinqing, the director of the Industry and Commerce Visiting Bureau, personally received them. The representatives all lamented the tragic situation of overseas Chinese oppressed by British imperialism. Our country should not entertain the Economic Survey Group coming to China. In addition, the Shanghai Aid Xiao Anti-Dutch General Assembly also has a telegram. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Declaration of the Support Association: Imperialists have always used political, military, and economic methods to invade China. Everyone knows this. Recently, the newspapers have been clamoring that the British Far East Economic Survey Group will arrive in Shanghai. Our country's foreign affairs authorities have ordered the Shanghai Office to contact the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to welcome them sincerely. We, the Overseas Chinese who have been brutally abused and expelled by British imperialism,</p>
<p>are very saddened to hear this news. Perhaps all compatriots and comrades in the country are as saddened as we are. Because the people of the country have a thorough understanding of the British imperialists' stubborn and unchanging policy of invading China. The intention of this Far East Economic Survey Group to come to China is, to put it bluntly, to carry out an economic invasion. If Britain trades with our country in a sincere and friendly manner, we do not advocate closing the country and refuse to connect with the mutual benefits of international commerce. But the facts tell us the opposite. The British imperialist colony of Singapore was originally a free port where anyone could live and trade freely. Why did the Governor of the area, Clementi, order the dissolution of the Kuomintang, arrest party members, imprison them, and impose the most cruel punishment? He then expelled them from the country in accordance with the bandit conscription law, and openly and strictly prohibited the promotion of domestic goods and the repatriation of Chinese workers. As a result, our overseas Chinese workers and businesses have suffered great losses. The late Premier Sun told us (those nations which treat us equally are our friends; those nations which treat us unequally are our enemies). Whether Britain is an ally or an enemy of our country is clear based on the facts. From the above, the British treat our overseas Chinese compatriots in this way, yet they still want to come to China to investigate and develop their economic invasion. If we flatter and welcome such enemies, wouldn't we be betraying the late Premier Sun's legacy? In other words, we would be traitors to the Three Principles of the People. Furthermore, Mr. Hu Hanmin, the speaker of the Legislative Yuan, said in a speech at the Legislative Yuan (Relieve the Suffering of Overseas Chinese Compatriots and Overthrow Imperialism): Chamberlain admitted that the British have always been small businessmen. In fact, businessmen must also treat customers well in order to develop their own trade. However, if they bully customers and oppress them at will, even if the world is big, there will probably be no such businessmen who can do good business for a long time. With the most grief-stricken and sincere heart, we implore the patriotic compatriots of the revolutionary government, hoping that they will unanimously refuse the Far East Economic Survey Group of British imperialism, refuse to entertain them, and ask all newspapers not to publish their news for their publicity. In order to implement the late Premier Sun's revolutionary spirit towards foreign countries and to save the crisis of national economic decline, we can only swear to overthrow the British imperialists who treat us unequally and their lackeys. In the event that the Far East Economic Survey Group is quite sincere in seeking contact with the central business community, they should first remove the obstacles that undermine Sino-British friendship. Please ask them to immediately send a telegram to the London government to dismiss Clementi, the governor of Singapore, and cancel all unequal harsh regulations that oppress the Kuomintang and torture the overseas Chinese, and correct past mistakes with equality and mutual benefit as the basis. Only then will it be worthy of our welcome. The Support Association for the Promotion of National Diplomacy for Overseas Chinese Expelled from British and Dutch Colonies in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Anti-Dutch Association Telegram: Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and all newspapers, groups, institutions, and compatriots: British imperialism harbors the ambition of economic invasion, and has specially organized the Far East Economic Survey Group to come to China to investigate. Our country's backward production and economic depression are all due to the imperialists' investigation of the details of the domestic economy, harboring the ambition of invasion. On the one hand, they will manipulate and buy up raw materials, and on the other hand, they will import machinery and textiles as much as possible. The weaknesses of industry and commerce are all in the eyes of foreigners as a result of the investigation, which will give British imperialism the basis to implement its invasion. It is better to refuse severely than to allow them in. Emphasizing national goods under the guise of finding ways to make a living is actually losing the way to enrich the people and improve customs. Moreover, in recent years, British imperialists have not hesitated to humiliate, torture, and oppress overseas Chinese in British territories, as our country has been unified and construction is expected. The General Assembly has passed a resolution to reject the British Far East Economic Survey Group. It is hoped that the gentlemen of the party and the country and the entire Chinese people will unanimously reject and refuse to entertain them in order to prevent the ambition of British imperial economic invasion. It will be a great fortune for industry and commerce, and a great fortune for the future of our overseas Chinese. Shanghai Aid Xiao Anti-Dutch General Assembly respectfully submits.</p>

<p>The Aid Xiao Anti-Dutch General Assembly sent a telegram stating: Shen Bao to Xiamen, Hong Kong, Shantou, and domestic and foreign newspapers: Ms. Xiao Xin'an, a teacher from our country, was tragically raped in turn by the Dutch first and second mates of the Zhivaderd, a ship of the Java Company, treating our Chinese people as if they were chickens and dogs. All those with national consciousness hate it to the core. Newspapers are the voice of the people, and all movements of acceptance and rejection concern the overall situation. Therefore, the General Assembly unanimously decided on the Yu day of this month to send a telegram requesting domestic and foreign newspapers to refuse to publish advertisements of the Java Company and news about the import and export of Java ships in order to advocate for the people. We urgently record the case and report it. We express our admiration for those who have refused to publish, and we request those who have not refused to publish to accept our request. We sincerely and humbly request your kind acceptance. Shanghai Aid Xiao Anti-Dutch General Assembly respectfully requests.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a telegram yesterday from the Qianyegonghui in Jiangyan Town, Taixian County, stating: The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, please note that the date of the end of the year for the national calendar is approaching. I humbly believe that your council's decision to set the day before the beginning of spring as the final settlement date shows that you are considering all aspects and sympathizing with the difficulties of the business community. However, it has recently been reported that it has not been approved by the Social Affairs Bureau, so the settlement period is again in question. The settlement is an important key in the business world. If it is not extremely difficult, why would we repeatedly request it? Moreover, this is the case everywhere, and it is not just a private opinion of a few people. Therefore, we send a special telegram to request that you please consider the business situation and maintain the original plan for the convenience of the public. The Chamber of Commerce immediately replied by telegram, stating that the Preparatory Committee of the Qianyegonghui in Jiangyan Town, Taixian County, has been informed of the Jing telegram. After investigating, our chamber has previously presented to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau a proposal to change the date of the final settlement date to the day before the beginning of spring, as requested by various industry associations in this city, but the order was not approved and it was difficult to approve it. Promoting the national calendar is a policy that must be implemented. It is feared that maintaining the original plan will not be easy. It is hoped that you will engage in preparations and personally implement it for the public good.</p>

<p>The Members' Meeting Decided to Implement It</p>
<p>The Silk and Satin Industry Association recently convened a members' meeting to discuss in detail the issue of the national calendar year-end settlement. All agreed that the national calendar settlement this year has long been ordered by the government and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>The industry has already complied with this directive and issued newspaper announcements and sent out notices to all. As there are only a few days left until the end of the year, most industries are also complying. The silk shops have a lot of credit and some are thousands of miles away, so they should be notified in advance so that they can prepare early and end on schedule. The association will publish in the Minshen News and the New Third Report to inform all customers, and print 40,000 notices to be distributed to each member. All silver and goods transactions must be cleared by the end of the national calendar year to prevent excuses for intentional delays due to habits. It was unanimously decided to hand this over to the Document Section to draft a notice, which is transcribed below: "To our customers, since we received the order from the National Government to promote the national calendar, we have already published a notice in the newspaper and sent out notices. Now we have received Instruction No. 3850 from the Executive Yuan regarding the fact that the national calendar year-end settlement cannot be changed, which has been forwarded to the provincial and municipal governments for inspection and implementation. As the date of the final settlement at the end of the year is approaching, all silver and goods transactions must be settled by the end of the national calendar year. We hope that all customers will strictly abide by government orders and comply. In addition to publishing a notice in the newspaper, we will also send a letter to inform you. We hope that you will investigate and follow suit. Sincerely wishing you peace and prosperity, the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association."</p>
<h3 id="e130">Money Houses Vigorously Advocate Reducing Loans <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Qianye Association previously announced in the Shanghai newspapers from October 1st due to the fear that inland merchants might still use the habit of not ending the year according to the national calendar, causing great danger. And requested the National Federation of Commerce to announce to the national commerce, and asked the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to send letters to various industry associations, so that they could prepare calmly to avoid stagnation and danger. In the past month, the association has received letters from the Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce and the Dongtai County Chamber of Commerce, detailing the difficulties of the inland commercial situation in the national calendar year-end settlement. Yesterday, eight representatives from the Qianye Associations of Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and Yangzhou came to the association to personally present various difficulties, saying that if they must end the year according to the national calendar, it is feared that the exchanges between various ports and Shanghai may not be able to be handled on schedule. The association found itself in a difficult situation because the government had rejected all appeals for change from various commercial groups, and many Qianye in various ports had exchanges with Shanghai banks. If the year cannot be ended on schedule, it will inevitably lead to financial stagnation. It is also heard that various Shanghai money houses are vigorously advocating reducing travel loans to avoid danger. The current operating rate is almost 50% less than in previous years. This is the peak season for various industries in winter, but they are affected by this, and various businesses cannot operate fully, causing each industry to decline day by day.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Cooperative Training Institute Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Tong Xingbai Gives a Speech</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Department-sponsored Cooperative Business Instructor Training Institute has been preparing for over a month. The internal organization has now been completed. The opening ceremony was held yesterday, with a total of 50 people attending, including faculty, students, and guests. The meeting was chaired by Tong Xingbai, the director, and recorded by Zhong Weishi. First, the chairman delivered a speech, followed by speeches from faculty members Zhang Tinghao and Cheng Junqing, and guests such as Zhang Guowei, on the theory and plans of the cooperative business, all of which were brief and profound. The speeches were very long. The chairman's speech is summarized as follows: Comrades, the Cooperative Business Instructor Training Institute sponsored by the Municipal Party Department is holding its opening ceremony today. Why do we want to run this training institute? If we know this, we can see that the Municipal Party Department is paying great attention to the cooperative business and is eager to realize it. It is generally believed that the relationship between the cooperative movement and the party is the same as that of the national goods movement and the afforestation movement, which are both subsidiary tasks of the party. However, it is not known that the cooperative business is the core of the economic construction of the Three Principles of the People. Because the Three Principles of the People not only solve political and national problems, but also solve economic problems. However, solving economic problems not only passively eliminates economic shortcomings, but also actively implements economic construction. How is the economic construction of the Three Principles of the People? The Premier's legacy has clearly told us that the economic evolution of the world and society is nothing more than four principles: (1) Improvement of social industry (2) Public ownership of transportation and transportation (3) Direct taxation (4) Socialization of distribution, but we can analyze and summarize it, it can be said that the first two types are to seek the development of production, and the latter two types are to seek the equality of distribution. In other words, it is to solve the problem of production and distribution. From this, it can be seen that the central issue of economics is nothing more than production and distribution. Because the first two items require the improvement of social industry and the return of transportation and transportation organs to public ownership, which are all methods to promote production development. The third item is direct taxation, which is levied on the surplus of the capitalist class to compensate for the deficit, and is also a method of equal distribution. As for the fourth item, the socialization of distribution, it explains the organization of cooperation. On the surface, it seems to be focused on distribution, but in fact, cooperation can not only solve the problem of distribution, but also solve the problem of production. Because the distribution of cooperative enterprises is for production, and the production of cooperative enterprises is for distribution. If the cooperative business is successful, the economic construction of society will have a foundation. Therefore, of the above four types of economic evolution, the fourth type is the most important. Therefore, the Premier alone praised the fourth type of socialization of distribution (that is, the cooperative system) the most and praised it continuously. In the future, the primary task of our party's economic construction is to fully develop cooperative enterprises, so that parasitic classes and plundering classes in society are reduced. The evolution of society and the welfare of the people all depend on this. Although the revolution has not been thoroughly successful, the bad elements in the country have gradually been cleared. The establishment of the social and economic system and the construction of economic organizations are the goals of our party's efforts in the future. The significance of our establishment of the Cooperative Business Instructor Training Institute lies in this point. However, the theory of cooperation is profound, and there are very few talents with this knowledge. Even the comrades of this party who study this knowledge are not many. Therefore, on the one hand, we must encourage comrades to study earnestly to cultivate specialized talents, and on the other hand, we must ask you to take on the responsibility of publicity and guidance, so that the people will have a general understanding and concrete construction of the cooperative business. At the same time, I hope that you will treat the cooperative business as a lifelong belief after you have completed your studies, and earnestly carry it out at any time and in any place. You must not only regard it as a tool for individuals to seek employment. You must know that the cooperative doctrine is a part of the Principle of People's Livelihood. Practicing the cooperative doctrine is to practice the Three Principles of the People. This time, the opening of the institute has also been taken up by the comrades of the China Cooperative Society as faculty members. I am very grateful for this enthusiasm and perseverance. At the same time, all comrades should also deeply understand this meaning and strive to learn in order to live up to the expectations of the lecturers and the original intention of the opening of this institute.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Preferred Design for the Generalissimo Commemorative Tower <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>By Messrs. Fan Wenzhao and Zhao Shen</p>
<p>A Brief Description of the Design's Outline</p>
<p>Ever since the passing of the Generalissimo, the Central Government, in order to forever commemorate and eternally extol his imperishable legacy, planned to allocate 500,000 national currency to construct a Generalissimo Commemorative Tower in the mausoleum grounds. The Mausoleum Management Committee invited renowned architects, both Chinese and foreign, to submit designs. Several months have passed, and yesterday the committee began evaluating the submitted designs. The design by Messrs. Fan Wenzhao and Zhao Shen, renowned architects of this city, was selected as the top choice. A brief outline of their design is as follows:</p>
<p>I. Exterior Plan of the Commemorative Tower: The entire tower adopts a purely classical Chinese style, emphasizing solemnity and elegance. Its total height is 220 feet, divided into 15 stories with an octagonal floor plan. The tower's base is built on two levels of stone</p>
<p>platforms, evoking the grandeur of mountains. Each level of the stone platform is divided into two layers. Platforms are constructed on the third and fifteenth stories of the tower body to allow visitors to ascend and view the surroundings. The remaining stories are free from platforms, so those desiring a panoramic view can ascend directly to the top, widely disseminating the Three Principles of the People. The tower's apex is a delicately designed pavilion, topped with a crowning roof to enhance its majestic appearance. Surrounding the tower is a broad octagonal platform, with four smaller platforms further down to amplify the tower's imposing presence and provide viewing areas for visitors.</p>
<p>II. Interior Plan of the Commemorative Tower: The interior of the tower has several key features: (1) Each floor is equipped with two escalators located in the center of the tower, arranged in a continuous loop, wide enough to facilitate comfortable ascending and descending and prevent collisions. (2) The corridors around each floor are uninterrupted, providing visitors with ample space to read the full text of the Three Principles of the People without overcrowding or confinement. (3) A deep well is located in the middle of the escalators on each floor, allowing visitors to look directly down from the top, transmitting sound and color from above and below to enhance interest. (4) Each floor is engraved with the Three Principles of the People in a connected sequence from bottom to top, ensuring that the text is uninterrupted. The font size of each section will be varied according to the length of the text and the available wall space on each floor. Each floor will be engraved with one section, or the section with a longer text will be engraved on a floor with a wider wall area, regardless of sequence. (5) On each floor, above the</p>
<p>engraved text, twenty-four windows are opened to ensure ample light and air circulation. Protective stone panels are installed below to achieve perfection.</p>
<p>III. Plan for the Surroundings of the Commemorative Tower: As the tower must be situated on the north-south axis of the mausoleum, the entire site layout must be designed according to this axis. Therefore, the original ring road around the mausoleum should be reconstructed as the main route directly leading to the commemorative tower. At the point where the central axis intersects with the ring road, a wide plaza should be created to accommodate parking. At one end of the plaza, a large stone archway will serve as the main entrance to the commemorative tower. From there, a paved path will lead up the slope to the platform surrounding the tower. In addition to the paved path, a ring</p>
<p>road will be constructed around the mountain so that visitors who do not wish to use the paved path can drive to the rear of the tower from either end of the main road, where a parking lot will be established. A convenient path will also be constructed on the back of the mountain, directly connecting to the existing road behind the mountain. Small pavilions will be built on both sides of the tower for visitors to rest and</p>
<p>relax.</p>
<p>IV. Construction Materials for the Commemorative Tower: To symbolize a model for eternal durability, the tower will be constructed with robust and durable materials. The tower's frame will be entirely made of reinforced concrete. The exterior walls and roof will be made of aesthetically pleasing granite. The interior walls, where the text will be engraved, will be made of marble. Escalators, railings, and other components will also be made of marble to achieve magnificence. Except for the steel, which must still be imported, all other materials will be sourced domestically.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Water Company Should be Responsible for Water Cutoff <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Taxpayers Association Sends Letter to Company</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Waterworks Company yesterday, stating: "We have received numerous letters from users reporting that your company has issued notices of impending water cutoff. While investigating these reports, we received a letter from Dou Yaoji, stating that on November 21st, the Shanghai Waterworks Company sent a letter stating that they should submit the tax bill for 90 taels for the rent, doubling the six-percent water fee for Kailu Road and Yangshupu Road, for verification. Otherwise, the water would be cut off on November 30th. Dou Yaoji submitted the water bill for these two locations, along with the water bills for Edward Road and Longmen Road, which are also managed by them, and for convenience, in accordance with practice, sent the six-percent water fee (as the letter specified 'Chinese houses, six-percent water fee') on November 24th. However, the company returned the bill and water fee in full, with a note adding the amount of the water fee. The dispute over the water company's price increase has not yet been resolved, and the November 30th deadline for the water cutoff is fast approaching. If the company disregards everything and actually cuts off the water, causing various losses, including life and property, to our owners and tenants, the company should bear full responsibility. In addition to sending a letter to the company questioning them, we are submitting a detailed account of the situation. We hope you will investigate. We are also responding to a letter from a citizen, stating: 'We acknowledge receipt of your letter of November 27th. Your method of dealing with the natural and arbitrary price increase is very reasonable. If all members of the association followed your example, we would certainly be able to achieve the goal of canceling the price increase. It can serve as a model for the members of the association. As for the water cutoff, the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association, as the highest organization representing all residents, will certainly strive to restore the situation by reasoning and adopting effective measures, so there is no need to worry. If the company actually cuts off the water, then all responsibility should be borne by the company, as the harm caused by the water cutoff will be even more tragic than the unfortunate incident of May 30, 1925.' We are responding to your letter. We hope you will investigate." (New Sound News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e140">Order Issued to Eliminate Remaining Bandits and Communists <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Garrison Command has Instructed All Counties Yesterday</p>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command received instructions yesterday from the Ministry of Military Affairs, stating: "In accordance with orders, please note that regarding the matter of clearing the countryside and suppressing bandits, instructions were previously issued by the Executive Yuan in April of this year to forward to subordinate units to earnestly report on and implement the resolution of the Third National Congress to eliminate bandits and stabilize society, etc. The original resolution and compiled regulations on autonomy, clearing the countryside, and suppressing bandits were copied and distributed for strict compliance. Subsequently, in January of this year, the Executive Yuan forwarded the National Government's order to the Central Executive Committee to handle the request from the Hankou Municipal Party Department Temporary Reorganization Committee to forward to military and political organs to vigorously clear the countryside.

<h3 id="e144">Record of Li Guoliang's Kidnapping <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Five Bandits Suddenly Arrive on Zhejiang Road</p>
<p>Gaining Entry by Pretending to Deliver Gifts</p>
<p>Kidnapping the Owner and Leaving a Ransom Note</p>
<p>Villagers Untie Him After He Spits Out Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday at 7:00 PM, Li Guoliang, the Yunnanese owner of the Xingli Tin Mining Company at No. 818, Lane 2, Tongchunfang, Zhejiang Road, was suddenly visited by five bandits who claimed to be delivering a gift. They then produced guns and</p>
<p>confined everyone in the shop to one room, while abducting Li and taking him away by car. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Dinner in High Spirits: Li Guoliang, a 32-year-old Yunnanese, has been in Shanghai for many years, running the Xingli Tin Mining Company at No. 818, Lane 2, Tongchunfang, Zhejiang Road, and also engaging in other side businesses. His family also lives upstairs. The company employs an accountant named Shang, two partners, and a cook. Yesterday at 6:00 PM, Li Guoliang returned from work, and by 7:00 PM, he was having dinner in the living room with his concubine and the accountant, Shang.</p>
<p>Gaining Entry by Pretending to Deliver Gifts: While Li and others were feasting, they suddenly heard someone calling from the back door. When asked what they wanted, the person replied that they had a gift for the accountant, Mr. Shang. The cook, Li Chunshan, thinking someone had come to deliver a gift, hurriedly opened the back door. Unexpectedly, five burly men rushed in, some wearing black overcoats, others in military uniforms, with varying accents. They produced guns and told the cook, Li Chunshan, not to make a sound, or he would be killed.</p>
<p>The Cook Cannot Escape: Having entered the premises, the bandits were bound to enter the room. Li Guoliang, seeing the situation was not good, tried to remain calm and asked what was happening. The five bandits produced guns and held them to everyone's chests, preventing them from speaking. His concubine, seeing this, turned pale with fear and trembled. The bandits then forced the accountant and the concubine into a small room and locked the door. The cook, seeing that the bandits had not yet targeted the house, thought of escaping through the front door but was spotted by the bandits, who threatened him with a gun, so Li dared not move.</p>
<p>Leaving a Note and Taking the Victim: Li Guoliang saw that the bandits were not stealing anything and did not know their intention. He stood dumbfounded in the room, waiting for the bandits' orders. Before long, the five bandits dragged Li out the back door, while</p>
<p>leaving a note, instructing his family not to report to the police. The cook, Li Chunshan, also managed to follow them to the alley entrance. The bandits forced Li into a car and sped off northward. The cook did not know the car's license plate number and did not call for help, which was foolish.</p>
<p>The Police Are Investigating: After seeing his boss kidnapped, Li Chunshan stood dumbfounded at the alley entrance. After a while, the police patrol arrived, and Li reported the situation. Although the Chinese and Western detectives searched everywhere, they could not find the bandits' trail. Reporters went to Li's residence to investigate. According to the cook, Li Chunshan, a few days ago, a fellow townsman of the boss came to borrow money, and because his request could not be satisfied, he left disgruntled. There had been no other unusual occurrences before this. It is now learned that the police believe this case is quite bizarre and are determined to crack it and arrest the bandits as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Bandits Hire a Car: About an hour before the incident occurred last night, around 6:05 PM, two uninvited guests suddenly arrived at the Northern Automobile Company at No. 35 Da San Wu, Lao Bei Menkou, Minguo Road, in the Southern City. One was wearing a grayish-green suit, the other a blue cloth jacket and trousers. The man in the suit was carrying a leather bag, and he claimed his name was Zhou. He said he needed to hire a car to go to Lafayette Road, Lafayette Lane. The company's accountant immediately ordered the driver, Xu Chunjian (a local, 26 years old), to drive vehicle No. 12486 (municipal number 4299), a yellow</p>
<p>Chevrolet convertible, to take them there.</p>
<p>The Driver Recounts the Incident: The car traveled west along Minguo Road, entered Fangbang Road, and passed the Nanyang Bridge, arriving directly at Lafayette Road. When it reached Lafayette Lane, the car stopped. A man in a gray robe was already waiting at the lane entrance. Seeing the car arrive, he jumped into the car. The man in the suit immediately ordered the driver to drive to Shanzhong Road. The driver obeyed and drove straight to the newly built road near No. 43 Beishanzhong Road, where he was told to stop. The man in the suit then</p>
<p>pulled out a gun, forced the driver out of the car, and dragged him to a bamboo fence</p>
<p>in a dark place.</p>
<p>The Driver Cries for Help: At the same time, a bandit took out wads of麻 cotton from his pocket and first tied the driver's hands behind his back to the bamboo fence. Then, he used a section of bamboo tube about an inch or two long, wrapped in cotton wool, to tightly gag the driver's mouth like a horse's bit. The driver was unable to speak. About ten minutes later, three bandits got into the car and sped off eastward. Another quarter of an hour later, a villager happened to pass by. The driver struggled and managed to spit out the cotton wool. Then, he cried out loudly for help. The villager heard the sound and, after investigating, untied him.</p>
<p>Reporting to the Police and Tracking Down the Car: After being untied with the villager's help, the driver ran to the nearby Baojian Road Police Station to report. After hearing the news, the police station immediately dispatched a detective to investigate in detail. The detective then ordered the driver to return to the car dealership and be on standby for questioning. At the same time, he telephoned various police stations in the Public Concession and the Chinese area to alert them to intercept the car. However, at exactly 7:00 PM, a kidnapping occurred at Tongchunfang, Zhejiang Road. Although the car's license plate number was not observed at the time, it was suspected that it was the same car from the Northern Automobile Company. It was not until around 10:00 PM that the car was discovered on Avenue Petain.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Pan Sha Desperate to Find Son, Mistakenly Reunites Another's Flesh and Blood <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>If They are Your Own Children</p>
<p>Why Ask Their Age?</p>
<p>Pan Sha, a local resident of Qipulu Road in the Public Concession, had a son who was abducted by bandits last year. Sha searched everywhere but could not find him. Overwhelmed by longing for his son, he almost fell ill. Fortunately, he recovered after strenuous treatment. However, he still did not forget his son and</p>
<p>would scrutinize any child of a similar age he encountered outside, hoping to find his beloved son. Yesterday morning, Sha was walking on Ningwu Road on business when he suddenly saw a woman around thirty years old with rather ugly features walking forward with a boy and a girl. The girl was slightly older than the boy, and both were between five and six years old. Sha originally wanted to continue walking, but he followed them. Suddenly, he heard the woman say to the girl, "How old are you this year?" The girl replied, "I'm six years old this year." Hearing the words "six years old," Sha was immediately reminded of his own heartbreak because his kidnapped son</p>
<p>was also six years old. Then, he thought that if these two children were the woman's own, she wouldn't need to ask their age. He also felt that the woman looked fierce, and it was difficult to avoid other suspicions. Once his suspicions were aroused, he paid even closer attention to her actions. After walking several dozen more steps, they arrived at a fruit stall. The woman and the two children stopped. The woman took out two small foreign coins, bought several oranges, and gave them to the two children. Then, they continued forward, but her movements seemed rushed. At this point, Sha felt even more strange and followed closely behind. Near Tianbaoli in Haining Road, the woman realized that someone was following her, and her behavior became somewhat artificial. Sha took another step forward</p>
<p>and asked the woman what her relationship was to the two children. The woman replied that they were the children of a neighbor, whom she was taking for a walk. Then, she pretended to say to the two children, "I've recognized this place, you can go back now." Hearing this, Sha retorted to the woman, "The two children are young and ignorant, how can you let them go back alone? Since they are your neighbors, why don't you accompany them back?" The woman was speechless at this point, and as the number of onlookers gradually increased, she falsely claimed that she didn't recognize the way back, so she was letting the two children lead the way. At this time, Xu Bangda, a member of the security corps, stepped forward to question the woman, who was evasive. He then called the police, and the group was taken to the First Precinct of the Fourth District of the Public Security Bureau on Mongolia Road. After questioning by Director Yao, it was learned that the woman was Ren Yan, thirty-four years old, living at No. 6 Gongxing Road, Xiaocaichang, Baoshan Road. Because she didn't know the way, she was letting the two children lead the way. The rest of her testimony was evasive. The two children, Shi Sanbao, six years old, and Shi Didi, four years old, were both young and ignorant and made no statements. While the interrogation was in progress, Shi Zhang, the children's father, rushed to the police station, reporting that his children were lost. The police ordered him to identify Shi Sanbao and Shi Didi, who were indeed his lost children. The children were joyfully reunited with their father, and he burst into tears. Sha, witnessing this scene, also felt saddened and almost wept. However, Ren Yan, who had committed the crime of abduction, could no longer deny it and confessed to kidnapping the children. The director then ordered her to be sent to the Judicial Section for review.</p>

<p>Brothers Attempt Parricide</p>
<p>Lecherous Wife Provokes Lover</p>
<p>Wu Wanliang, a salt-merchant from Yancheng, ekes out a living as a boatman. He has two brothers, Wan Kang and Wan Shun. Wanliang's wife, Chu, however, is restless in her marriage, and is involved with her cousin, Wang Dahui, carrying on a clandestine affair for three years. Although Wanliang knows about this, he lacks any evidence. On the fourth day of the tenth lunar month, Wang Dahui suddenly conspired with Wan Kang and Wan Shun. Each carrying sharp knives, quicklime, ropes, etc., they secretly planned to murder Wu Wanliang. Unfortunately, the plan was discovered and foiled before any deed could be done. Wanliang, now wary, took extra precautions. Around 7 p.m. the other night, Wanliang moored his boat in a secluded spot, ready to sleep. As he was preparing for bed, he noticed a flash of light in the cabin. He quietly crept back in and saw five men and women, each carrying a weapon. Wu Wanliang was shocked and jumped from the bed, shouting for help. The water patrol heard the commotion, came forward to rescue him, and arrested four of the assailants. During questioning, Wu Wanliang claimed that his brother Wan Kang, carrying a rope, had already escaped. His younger brother, Wan Shun, carried a bag of quicklime, while Wang Dahui wielded a sharp knife. All the weapons had been thrown into the Suzhou River. Furthermore, Wu claimed, the reason his brothers had plotted this heinous crime was to seize his land. His wife, Chu, was also involved, conspiring with her lover, Wang Dahui, to murder him. After verifying his statement, the patrol leader sent the assailants to the Judicial Section for review.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Large Batch of Kidnappers Tried in French Concession Yesterday <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Lu Shaoda is the Assassin of Guang Huanwen</p>
<p>During the Mid-Autumn Festival this year, a large group of kidnappers raided the market town of Xiaoqiaotou in Nanxiang County, Wuxi, openly looting and abducting men and women. The victims repeatedly received ransom letters from the kidnappers, requesting payment in Shanghai. The French police detectives, under the command of Inspector Jin Jiulin, along with Detective Li Yaolong, Deputy Detectives Mao Jingen, Wang Rusong, Qian Yumin, and Constables Zhang Ziying and Zhou Buguang, investigated and successively arrested Lu Shaoda, Liu Fusheng, Yang Henglai, Guo Heyu, Ma Liangchen, Lu Jugen, Du Jinsheng, Xu Xianghua, Xu Cheping, Luo Xianghua, Liang Buhua, Zhang Jinsan, Zhang Huansheng, Sheng Changjin, Li Zhishan, and the female accomplices Luo Xie, Zhang Ma, and Xie Shen, totaling eighteen people. They also seized stolen money amounting to 2,500 yuan and brought them to the police station for investigation. However, the hostages had already been moved elsewhere by accomplices, making it impossible to rescue them. All these details were reported previously. Yesterday, the police sent the robbers to the French court for trial. The Wuxi Public Security Bureau detectives first filed a request to transfer the robbers to their jurisdiction for trial. Then, Western Detective Chief Sacher reported that it was discovered that the first defendant, Lu Shaoda, had used a weapon on the evening of the 4th of this month at No. 10 Baoyuli, assassinating Shui Shang, a detective from the Public Security Bureau. Huanwen died, having been instigated by the bandit leader Gao Guiyou. Afterwards, he was given 50 yuan. There is now a signed confession from the defendant as evidence. Please verify. The defendant Lu Shaoda and others denied the charges in their testimony. The Chinese and Western judges ruled that since the defendants had confessed at the police station and had been identified by the victims, they could not deny it. They were ordered to be handed over to the Wuxi Public Security Bureau detectives to be taken back for trial. The stolen money of 2,500 yuan was attached. The first defendant, Lu Shaoda, was sentenced to five years in the Western Prison and expulsion from the country. He was also handed over to the detectives to be taken back for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Ni Guangxun Abandons His Wife <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Eight Years of Cohabitation Abandoned in a Day, The Sister Refuses Support, What Will Happen to the Children?</p>
<p>Ni Guangxun, 25 years old, from Fujian, was studying at Zhizhi University. His wife, Fan, 29 years old, from Changshu, has been cohabiting with him for eight years and has three children. When Ni's father was alive, he worked for the Customs and the family was quite wealthy. Since Ni and his wife began cohabiting, he has been studying at school and not working. The expenses for his studies and family living have all been paid for out of the family assets. After Ni's father passed away two years ago, all the assets were managed by Ni's sister and brother-in-law. His brother-in-law, Zeng Yufang, from Guangdong, works for an American company. Daily expenses are all controlled by his sister. This summer, Ni graduated from Zhizhi University. In the</p>
<p>seventh lunar month of this year, on the evening of the 30th, Ni suddenly sent his wife out to see a play alone. When she returned, Ni was gone, and all his personal clothes, belongings, diplomas, etc. had been removed. When his wife returned and realized what had happened, she rushed to her sister's house to ask. But, to her surprise, she was driven out of the house by her sister. However, her sister told Ni's uncle, Ni Wenming, that Ni had gone to Peking University in Beiping to study. Ni's uncle sent a letter to the school to inquire, but the school returned the letter saying that there was no Ni Guangxun registered there. Since Ni left home, it has been more than two months and there has been no news of him. His wife has also inquired with friends and relatives, but to no avail. His sister is also no longer providing her with any support. Not only is she deprived of daily necessities, but she is also in the final stages of her sixth pregnancy and about to give birth. Fan, angry at her sister, feels that she is not without suspicion and intends to sue her in court.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Yesterday's Autopsy of Three Assassinated Bandits <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The home of Madame Qian Chen, located at number 375 Fuxing Lane on Zhoujiazui Road in Hongkou, was suddenly invaded by six bandits, namely Zhang Huayun, Chen Hanyun, Zhou Zihua, He Ziming, and Li Yu, the previous morning at 9:15 AM. The bandits brandished handguns, threatened the residents, and looted gold and silver jewelry worth approximately 100 yuan before fleeing. Upon receiving the report, the Harbin Police Department immediately dispatched a team of detectives, including Chief Detective Zhu Hanbo, Detectives Yuan Shiqing and Zhao Jigui, as well as Chinese, Western, Indian, and Japanese constables, to apprehend the bandits. The bandits dared to open fire and resist arrest, leading to a fierce gunfight on the spot. As a result, three bandits, Zhang, Chen, and Zhou, were fatally wounded by the detectives and died instantly. The other two bandits, He and Li, were captured alive, while one unknown bandit escaped over the roofs. The previous report provided a detailed account of the incident. The corpses of the three bandits were transported to Fielun Road for autopsy. He and Li were detained in the police station and escorted to the Special District Local Court for questioning yesterday morning. After the court session, they were ordered to be detained pending a future hearing. At 10:00 AM, Prosecutor Guo Wei, accompanied by a forensic doctor, arrived to conduct an autopsy. The judge then took his seat and heard the account of the incident from the Western police chief. It was revealed that the deceased bandit Zhang Huayun had previously rented room number 34 at the Zhejiang First Hostel on Sanma Road, using the alias He Jingqing. The hostel's tea server confirmed this information. Xu Gensheng testified that the deceased had been renting the room since August 19th of the lunar calendar and owed a significant amount of rent, constantly delaying payment despite repeated requests. Furthermore, people were frequently seen entering and exiting the room. After verifying the statements, Mr. Guo ordered an autopsy confirming that the three deceased bandits, Zhang Huayun, Chen Hanyun, and Zhou Zihua, were indeed shot and killed while resisting arrest. He ordered the corpses to be prepared for coffin enshrinement at the Pushan Villa.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Rent Dispute in Jiyi Lane <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Increased Rent Followed by Cancellation of Conditions</p>
<p>Landlord Counter-Sues Tenants for Unpaid Rent</p>
<p>Tenants in Jiyi Lane on Shanxi Road, due to the landlord Yizun Company, whose manager, Ye Shantao, instructed its rental agent, the British firm Tonghe Yanghang, to increase the rent but then canceled the agreed-upon terms, hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to file a lawsuit with the Special District Local Court. The lawsuit sought confirmation that the established lease agreement was valid. Because Yizun Company had already sold the property in Jiyi Lane to Hexing Company, owned by Xi Qisun, the lawsuit also requested a ruling that Hexing Company be bound by the aforementioned agreement. It is found that there are a total of twenty-eight or nine households of tenants in Jiyi Lane, and a large portion of them, seventeen households including Mohuaxuan, have joined this lawsuit. The reasons for their lawsuit are roughly as follows: The rent for houses in Jiyi Lane was already extremely high. On June 1st of this year, the rental agent Tonghe Yanghang, leveraging British influence, announced to all tenants that they had one month to move out under the guise of renovation, otherwise their rent would be more than doubled. The tenants did not dare to contend with such power. Representatives elected by the tenants' joint association repeatedly appealed to Tonghe and eventually agreed to the rent increase conditions: city-facing houses would increase by 50%, while those inside the lane would increase by 30%, from August 1st of the nineteenth year to July 31st of the twenty-fourth year, with no further rent increases or renovations. In addition, if the property was sold within these five years, the new owner would also be bound by these conditions. Wanliyuan, Weixinyufeng, and Yongsanjia had already paid rent according to the new rent amount and notified the tenants, and the agreed-upon conditions were recorded in the lease agreement, which was stamped and signed by the tenants. However, on September 19th, a letter suddenly arrived stating that Yishenghang, Xinminxuanshe, Mohuaxuan, and Yicheng Silk Factory had failed to comply with the agreement and were attempting to overturn the previous agreement. However, upon investigation, Yisheng and Yizun Company had signed a separate lease agreement, Xinmin had already exceeded half of the rent increase, Mohuaxuan had no objections, and Yicheng voluntarily terminated the lease. Therefore, how could they use this as an excuse to cancel the agreement? Then, on November 6th, a lawyer representing Hexing Company suddenly sent a letter stating that the company had purchased the property in Jiyi Lane and that Yizun Company had stated that it had not entered into any agreement with the tenants and requested that all tenants move out. The first defendant has acted deceitfully and with cunning, with the sole intention of raising land prices. Therefore, it should be ruled that the first defendant confirms the validity of the lease agreement and that the second defendant is equally bound by the agreement, etc. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenrong held a hearing to question each plaintiff, who were all present. Wang Zeceng, representing the plaintiffs, stated that after receiving the Tonghe notice, he sought help from Lu Shaotang, who had a close relationship with the landlord Ye Shantao. It was not until July 24th that they agreed on the rent increase conditions and established the lease contract. Later, because the contract lacked witnesses, it was rewritten on September 13th and sent to each household by Tonghe for stamping. However, Tonghe had not yet signed it when Tonghe sent a letter on September 19th declaring its cancellation and insisting on eviction. This morning, each tenant also received a letter from Xinghe Business Company, representing Hexing Company, also forcing tenants to move out. Then, lawyer Chen Tingrui recounted the occurrence of this case and the reasons for the lawsuit, stating that it was still unclear whether Yizun Company had actually sold the property. It is now heard that Yizun has counter-sued for unpaid rent, which is unreasonable. Because the tenants not only do not owe rent, but also wish to pay according to the new rent amount, the landlord has delayed collecting it, so the tenants have deposited the rent into the bank. He then submitted all relevant letters, contracts, rental receipts, and bank deposit slips for each tenant as evidence. Next, Lu Zhongliang, the lawyer representing the defendant Ye Shantao, stated that because the houses had been thirty-one years old, they urgently needed renovation, so the tenants were notified to move out. The tenants then sent Lu Shaotang to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Willing to increase rent, please defer the renovation for five years. The defendant does not dare to bear this dangerous</p>
<p>Responsibility. Therefore, Tonghe signed a contract with the tenants, requiring the tenants not to move or transfer for five years. The tenants had different opinions, with some unwilling to bear this heavy responsibility and others choosing to terminate their leases. Tonghe, seeing that the tenants' actions were inconsistent, sent a letter canceling the agreement. The current lawsuit is not from all tenants. However, these seventeen households owe more than eight thousand taels of rent as of November, so a counterclaim is filed and a declaration of execution is requested. Next, Cai Lucheng, the lawyer representing Xi Qisun, stated that Hexing Company purchased the property from Yizun for one million one hundred thousand taels of silver. On October 20th, an initial deposit of one hundred and ten thousand taels of silver was paid, and the remaining amount was scheduled to be paid by November 20th. When the deposit was paid, there was no news of any dispute. Later, upon seeing the tenants' advertisements, Hexing inquired with Yizun, who stated that they had not entered into any agreement with the tenants and that renovations could be guaranteed without difficulty. Now Hexing has notified the tenants to move out before January 30th. Now it is further stated verbally that counterclaims must also be filed against the tenants. Judge Xu then reviewed each piece of evidence presented by the three parties and returned them separately. Because Hexing Company will also file a counterclaim, the judge ordered the case to be rescheduled</p>

<h3 id="e151">Recruitment Scam Targeting Staff <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Scamming 500 Yuan in Deposits</p>
<p>Previously, the China Citizens Bank placed advertisements to recruit staff, and many job seekers were scammed out of their deposits. This trend has not abated, and recently, the Fuhua Bank also scammed Huang Bingyan out of his deposit under the guise of recruiting staff.</p>
<p>Huang, feeling cheated, filed a lawsuit in the Special District Local Court. According to his statement, he saw an advertisement in July this year for the Fuhua Bank recruiting staff and went to No. 8 Jiujiang Road to contact Manager Hua Liu Yingyang, Manager and Kepler's Bank Director Liu Jiugao, etc. He was told that the bank's capital was 500,000 and had been registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Therefore, on September 17, he paid a deposit of 500 yuan and held a receipt. On October 1, he entered the bank to take on the position of accountant, seeing that its interior was messy. He then learned that there were neither shareholders nor directors, and it had not been registered, knowing that he had been cheated. He asked for the deposit back and reported the case to the General Patrol House. At that time, Liu, etc., said that posting an advertisement to recruit compradors would surely generate tens of thousands of gold income. At that time, the deposit would be returned. If he wanted to cheat money, he would have to cheat huge amounts. Then he was repeatedly threatened when he asked for it. He had long planned to report it to the officials. Liu, etc., then invited Director Shen Hongji and cashier Cao Liugen to mediate and return 200 yuan first, giving a check for the rest. When he went to the Guohuo Bank to collect the money, they had no money stored. Therefore, the Guohuo Bank did not cash it. After repeated insistent requests, he received another 100 yuan, and the rest has not been collected, so he is suing. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng opened the trial. Only Shen Hongji, the defendant, appeared. The plaintiff invited Yuan Shilin, who had been scammed out of 1,000 yuan, to testify.

<h3 id="e152">Economic Doctorate Tang Huixuan Sues for Illegality <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>This case may have another story behind it.</p>
<p>The former Director of the Yichang Stamp Tax Bureau, Tang Huixuan, who holds a doctorate in economics and is also known as Shi'an or Chongci, filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Local Court against his wife, Zou Ai'zhen, and Chen Genwei, accusing them of adultery. The first instance ruled Zou Ai'zhen and Chen Genwei not guilty. Tang disagreed and appealed to the collegiate panel of the original court. After a final argument, the court announced its verdict at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon in the First Tribunal, presided over by Judge Shen Bingrong, accompanied by Judges Qian Chengjun and Han Jingdou. Tang Huixuan was not present. Zou Ai'zhen and Chen Genwei, accompanied by their lawyers Yan Yinwu, Jiang Yiping, and Zheng Yuxiu (represented by Wang Deyi), were present. The presiding judge first asked Zou Ai'zhen and Chen Genwei about their ages and origins, then rose and read the main text of the judgment: "The original judgment is revoked, and Tang Huixuan's first-instance lawsuit is rejected." It is heard that, according to the Code of Criminal Procedure, a spouse cannot file a lawsuit. The first-instance judgment should have been rejected by ruling and the prosecutor should be notified to treat it as a reported case, and cannot make a judgment of not guilty. Therefore, the second instance specially corrected it. However, when Tang Huixuan was involved in litigation in the Criminal Court, Zou Ai'zhen reported to the Prosecutor's Office that Tang had personally written a letter stating that he had a wife and son at home before marriage, confessing to fraud, and requested an investigation into bigamy and false accusation. Prosecutor Li had already investigated and ordered Tang to pay 1,000 yuan as security. However, because Tang's hearing was earlier, the investigation was suspended. Now the case has reached such a point. According to Zou's lawyer, she will continue to request the Prosecutor's Office to investigate, so there is another story behind this case.</p>

<p>Strange Family of the Shi Clan</p>
<p>Shi Dezong, a 22-year-old man from Nanjing, unmarried, worked as a car operator at the Sanxin Textile Factory on Yangshupu Road. He was honest and simple, and highly regarded by the factory. His father worked as an accountant in a factory in his hometown and earned a good monthly income. His mother passed away last year, and his family still had younger siblings who lacked care. His father remarried a woman with the surname of a month ago. He sent a letter to Shi informing him of this matter. Shi replied in a letter advising his father not to remarry to avoid suffering for his younger siblings. His father criticized him for being inappropriate after receiving the letter and resolutely decided to proceed with the marriage. Later, Shi learned of this and became depressed for ten days. After getting up at 6:30 AM yesterday morning, he suddenly had a suicidal thought and secretly took poison to commit suicide. Shortly after, he was discovered by a companion, who called the constable from Post 254 to come and take him to Tongren Hospital for treatment by car. Because Shi's rescue failed, he died at 10:00 AM that morning.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Municipal Government Bulletin Confirms the Name "Qingning Temple" <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Qingning Temple area in Pudong had a Qingning Temple built in the Song Dynasty, and the area was named after the temple. Later, because the market there became increasingly prosperous, the area was renamed Qingning City with a homophonic name. Recently, the Municipal Land and Public Works Bureaus canceled the old city and township names. The area is part of the Luxing District, and it is inconvenient to retain the name Qingning City. Therefore, they jointly requested the Municipal Government to restore the old name of Qingning Temple to conform to the new system. After receiving the request, the Municipal Government considered that Qingning Temple had historical significance and a significant impact on local customs. It was approved to use the old name and announced it to the public.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Bulletin is issued for the purpose of announcing that the Land and Public Works Bureaus jointly reported that the current Qingning Temple area in Pudong had a Qingning Temple built in the Song Dynasty, and the area was actually named after the temple. However, the custom is to call it Gaomiao, forgetting the origin of the temple. The Pudong Tanggong Rehabilitation Bureau, in order to develop the area and gradually make it a new city, named the area Qingning City with a homophonic name. The local people also have the name Qingning City in their minds. Because of its far-reaching intentions, the municipal map made by the Ministry of Land and the Ministry of Public Works' municipal ferries and Shangchuan Transportation Company also occasionally use the name Tian Qingning City. However, since the establishment of this municipal government, all existing city and township names have been canceled. This area is part of the Luxing District of this city and should be renamed to restore the name Qingning Temple. After discussions with the Ministry of Land, it is proposed to request the Municipal Government to announce it by decree to inform the public whether it is appropriate and respectfully submit a document for review and implementation. Accordingly, this Qingning Temple has historical significance and a significant impact on local customs. It should be allowed to follow its old name and still name the area Qingning Temple. In addition to instructions, a joint bulletin is issued to inform the public.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Patrolman Accidentally Kills Someone While Carrying a Gun <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>A Six-Year-Old Girl Dies in Vain</p>
<p>Guo Yuntian, from Anhui, is a patrolman with number 328 at the French Concession Police Department, whose family resides in the rear building of number 225 Taiside Lang Road. Guo went to work on the 27th at 7:00 PM while armed with a handgun and secretly went to his residence to rest. At that time, a woman surnamed Zuo, the wife of Zuo Benyuan (who works as a waiter at the Xindu Apartment on Ben'ai Duo Ya Road), who lived in the same small room as Guo, had never seen a handgun before. Seeing that Guo was wearing a handgun, she asked Guo to see it. Guo was in the process of taking out the handgun when, unexpectedly, the gun's firing mechanism activated. The bullet inside the gun suddenly flew out. At that time, Zuo's six-year-old daughter, Zuo Damaozi, was nearby. The bullet hit the girl's head, causing her to fall to the ground bleeding profusely. The child's mother and others took her to the Red Cross Hospital on Hague Road for treatment by bicycle. The patrolman, seeing that he had caused the accident, did not report to the police department. Instead, he took off his uniform and equipment and threw them over the police department's wall and fled without a trace. Although the girl was treated with all her strength by the doctors after being admitted to the hospital, the brain damage was too severe to cure. She died that night. The hospital reported to the police department, which ordered detectives to take the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for an autopsy.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Criminal Section of the French Concession Police Department summoned the relatives of the deceased to the scene and reported to Judge Zhu of the French Public Concession Court, who came to the scene and confirmed that the girl died of a gunshot wound. He instructed the relatives of the deceased to collect the body themselves pending review.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Autopsy</p>
<p>Zhang Peisan, a 67-year-old man from Zhenjiang, opened the Fukang Foreign Goods Store on Sanshan Street in Nanjing. The day before, he came to Shanghai alone to purchase goods and stayed at the Tongyu Stack in Zilai Street in the French Concession. At 3:55 PM on the 26th, he went out to conduct business. While walking near the large self-ringing clock on French Avenue, a car with the number 7788 driven by the driver Huang Dianqing, owned by the proprietor of the Pand Rongji Store, came. Zhang did not have time to retreat and was knocked down and injured in the head. Patrolman number 133 discovered and recorded the number and sent the injured person and car to Renji Hospital for treatment and reported to the police station. Because Zhang was old and seriously injured, the treatment was ineffective and he died at 3:15 PM the next afternoon. At that time, because there were no relatives of the deceased, the hospital notified</p>
<p>to the police station to take the body to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for autopsy. Then Zhang Yunxuan, the brother of the deceased, learned of this and went to the autopsy scene yesterday morning to report to the French Concession Police Department. The Traffic Section reported to Judge Zhu of the French Public Concession Court, who came to the scene to confirm that the deceased was indeed killed by a car accident. He ordered the relatives of the deceased to collect the body themselves pending review and asked the car owner to provide the relatives of the deceased with funeral expenses. After the autopsy, the relatives of the deceased prepared clothing and a coffin and temporarily placed it in the B She of the Jinggong Office before transporting it back for burial.</p>

<p>The Traffic Section of the Public Concession Police Department yesterday issued a circular stating that the office usually provides drivers with hand signal diagrams and instructs them to follow them. When applying for a driver's license, the use of hand signals must be tested before a license is issued, because these hand signals are extremely important in avoiding accidents. However, the office has recently received reports from citizens that drivers are not giving hand signals. In the future, if citizens see drivers not giving hand signals when they should be given, and any violations of traffic regulations, regardless of the car owner or driver, they should report to the Traffic Section. Unless the circumstances are serious and require a criminal complaint, and the reporter is willing to appear in court to testify, the office will keep the reporter's name confidential. After receiving the report, the office will warn the car owner and driver according to the severity of the circumstances and record it in the driver's performance record for future reference. The use of hand signals and traffic regulations are attached below. Drivers are requested to pay special attention to reduce car accidents and avoid causing death or injury.</p>
<p>Public Concession Public Works Bureau Bulletin No. 4031 (Regarding the Amendment of Traffic Regulations) announces that Traffic Regulation 31 relates to the use of hand signals by vehicle drivers and has now been amended to include the following paragraph: "To give the above signals, they may alternately use a mechanical or electrical device of a type approved by the Chief of Police. The installation of this device must not protrude beyond the overall width of the vehicle." This is specially announced to the public. Edward, Chief Executive, November 20, 1930.</p>

<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau issued an order stating that the Municipal Government Order No. 6458 stated that the residents of the French Concession west of Caoxi River and Jingyi area hold paper-tossing horse races every winter. This is a kind of game and sports activity that is unrelated to gambling. The government was afraid of trampling on farmland and hindering spring ripening and had previously banned the holding of the event. Now the Paper-Tossing Horse Race Association has stated that (1) the route should be reported to the government before each event; (2) the consent of the owners of farmland involved in the route should be obtained before each event; and (3) full compensation should be made if the farmland is damaged after each event. After review, it is feasible to tentatively approve it. The bureau is ordered to immediately inform the affiliated units of this order. A copy of the notice date and location translation of the association is attached. In addition to issuing orders and bulletins, the director is ordered to inform the units of this order. A copy of the notice date and location translation of the association is attached.</p>
<p>A copy of the date and location translation of the association is attached later. The first horse race is scheduled to be held on November 29 of this year, starting from Gao Pailou on Minhang Road, passing through the countryside to Zhangjiatang (transliterated place name), passing the steel bridge over the creek, then to Zhang Yaozhen (transliterated place name), and then passing through the cemetery on Minhang Road, then to Wu Jiazhai (transliterated place name). This location is north of the railway, close to the large steel bridge, and then to one mile south of Caoxi (transliterated place name) near Minhang Road.

<p>Discussing the Hygiene Bureau's Collection of Inspection Fees</p>
<p>More than 80 companies in the city's ham industry held a citywide representative meeting yesterday because the industry association recently received a letter from the Municipal Finance Bureau stating: "The Hygiene Bureau's letter No. 2982 stated that the inspection before and after slaughter has been fully implemented for pigs, cattle, and sheep transported to the concession and slaughtered and sold in the city. It is also necessary to inspect meat products transported from other provinces or outside the city. The Bureau has drafted the "Management Regulations for Meat Products Entering the City Inspection" and submitted it to the Municipal Government for approval in Directive No. 7592 for promulgation. (Omitted in the middle) Your bureau should be in charge and it is hoped that you will consult with meat merchants directly and separately. Once preparations are complete</p>
<p>The Bureau will begin the inspection work (omitted below)." Another inspection rule is attached, which stipulates that an inspection fee of one yuan per hundred catties of silver dollars will be charged. Violators will be ordered to have their inspection at the place of origin and fined two yuan per hundred catties of silver dollars. After receiving this letter, the association considered that ham and cured meat is a product that has undergone sophisticated processing and is durable for long-term storage, which is different from fresh pork, beef, and mutton and does not require inspection. Now suddenly adding inspection fees is tantamount to harming merchants. Therefore, the citywide representative meeting unanimously decided to oppose it and submitted a petition to the municipal government to revoke this announcement to alleviate business difficulties.</p>

<p>Chinese and Foreign Factories Must Comply Equally</p>
<p>Since the National Government issued a clear order stipulating the factory commemoration and holiday method, most factories in the city have followed it. However, there are occasional foreign-owned factories and a few Chinese who obey only superficially or regard it as a formality. In view of this, the Central Government specially instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inform the consuls stationed in Shanghai that all foreign-owned factories must comply, and instructed the Municipal Government to order all Chinese-owned factories to respectfully follow it. It is heard that the Municipal Government has already</p>
<p>issued instructions to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to forward the instructions to all factories for compliance.</p>

<p>Municipal Government Instructs to File Lawsuit Directly</p>
<p>Industry Fails to Hold Meeting, Reconciliation Hopeless</p>
<p>The pledge industry in the city requested to amend labor-capital conditions and the Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting to question them and instructed both parties to negotiate on their own. At the same time, the Municipal Government was asked whether the industry's conditions could be applied to the labor-capital dispute handling law for mediation according to law. It is heard that the Municipal Government has now instructed that the case does not apply to the labor-capital dispute handling law and should be filed in court directly. It is heard that the labor union held a joint meeting of district officials for this matter on the evening of the 27th. Chairman Wang Ganchen resolved the following events: (1) Each member of each group should report to the district meeting that the union's conditions movement committee is not strong enough and the five district officials should send a letter to question them. (2) A citywide representative meeting will be convened at 8:00 PM on the 28th of this month to discuss the direction of the conditions movement. (3) Approve the signing representatives to attend the meeting of the capitalist group. The Pledge Industry Association and the Special Zone Pledge Industry Association originally scheduled to hold a joint meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Because only 28 representatives from 109 members attended the meeting, including Baoyu, Runtai, and Wanji, etc., the number was insufficient to meet the quorum. The meeting was changed to a joint discussion, attended by Chairman Chuan Zuoheng and labor union representative Wang Ganchen, etc. as observers. As a result, it was decided to convene another joint meeting on December 5th to discuss the method.</p>

<p>— Long</p>
<p>A person who can think clearly and see through things will feel happy even in adversity; otherwise, even in favorable circumstances, they will have many troubles.</p>
<p>Often, things that seem to be almost certain often change temporarily and lead to disappointment. Therefore, no matter what you do, avoid boasting before it succeeds.</p>
<p>Those who are good at using people employ both kindness and severity.</p>
<p>They can make both the wise and the foolish fulfill their duties and achieve practical results. Those who are not good at using people take improper measures and can make the wise feel like sitting on pins and needles and the foolish show anger, which leads to many troubles.</p>
<p>A woman cannot truly understand her partner until after marriage because no matter who a man and woman associate with, they will never reveal their true selves until they achieve their goal.</p>
<p>The love between husband and wife is prone to change midway, but only a loving mother's love for her children is always fervent.</p>
<p>Low grain prices are indeed a blessing for the poor, but the prices of goods that have risen due to high rice prices should also fall accordingly.</p>
<p>Patriotism and saving the country cannot be achieved by the verbal propaganda of a few people; it must start with the united efforts of people from all walks of life to resist foreign goods.</p>
<p>During the tense northwest wind, the physical suffering of the poor due to hunger and cold is certainly many times greater than that of the rich, but the mental suffering of the rich due to the surrounding thieves is also many times greater than that of the poor.</p>

<p>— Zui Ling</p>
<p>Yang Xiaolou returned to Beijing from Tianjin to perform three days of charity plays: (1) "Disturbing Heaven" (安天會), (2) "Farewell My Concubine" (别姬), (3) "Returning to Jingzhou" (回荆州), also playing Zhang Guilan in "𧈢蜡廟" in a cross-dressing role. Xiaolou's face is gaunt, and his coughing is more frequent. He is no longer as majestic as before. Tianjin newspapers reported that Xiaolou had accepted a contract from the Shanghai Grand Theater with a salary of 15,000, the same as Mei Lanfang. Shanghai newspapers, however, claimed that Xiaolou was actually coming to perform at a Chen family hall performance. In fact, neither is true. Xiaolou's actions are always decided by his son-in-law, Xiao Wutong. Xiao Wutong has already collected a deposit and will perform at the Kai Ming Theater, as seen in the posters, but the play list has not been determined.</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang arrived in Tianjin on the 24th for a one-day stay and then proceeded south because Meng Xiaodong was in Tianjin and they needed to say goodbye separately. There was talk of not bringing Wang Fengqing on this trip, but Wang Fengqing has already appeared on Shanghai posters, so he probably won't be abandoned in his old age. Recalling the early years of the Republic, Mei and Wang came to Shanghai together to perform at the Dan Gui First Stage. Fengqing's salary was 1,200, while Mei's was only 800. Recalling that year, Fengqing must have had the sigh of "someone's mother is old and no longer useful."</p>
<p>Ma Lianliang's performances in Tianjin clearly have excellent audience appeal, but every time he appears, there is a rebellion. New plays such as "Hongmen Banquet", "Chu-Han Contention", and "诛仙鎭" are about to be performed. In fact, "Chu-Han Contention" is "Burning Ji Xin," "诛仙鎭" is "Wang Zuo Cutting Off His Arm," and "Hongmen Banquet" seems to be "Rouge 折." Recently, Beijing actors have liked to arrange old plays and change their names, probably to attract audiences. For example, Yan Jupeng's recently arranged "The Biography of Loyalty and Filial Piety" is a combination of "Scolding Yang Guang" and "Nanyang Pass," or one might be puzzled when first seeing the posters, but one would suddenly understand as soon as one enters the theater.</p>
<p>Xun Huisheng and Shang Xiaoyun both have new plays. Xun's is "Legend of the White Snake", "The Woman Warrior of Eastern Wu," and Shang's is "Emei Sword", "Peach Blossom Formation". In terms of scriptwriting, Xun is better than Shang, but in terms of box office appeal, Shang is better than Xun.</p>
<p>Wang Youchen's performances in Shanghai are the most tepid, but his performances in Tianjin are unusually energetic. He likes to use the "嘎"調 and high-pitched singing, even surpassing Gao Qingkui. The people of Tianjin also value him more than Gao Ma, probably because the residual power of the son-in-law of Tan Xinpei is still present.</p>
<p>Gao Qingkui has a son named Sheng Lin who is studying at Fu Liancheng. His every move closely resembles Qingkui. Watching him, one almost suspects that Qingkui has been shrunk and is performing a puppet show on stage, which is extremely interesting. Fu Liancheng is a famous small troupe in Beijing. Tickets for each performance are sold out ten days in advance. Among them, Ye Shengzhang is the best. Ye is a disciple of Wang Changlin. The plays "巧連環", "盗甲祥梅寺", etc., that he performs are truly what the theater posters call "青出盖世, 　絕無上者也".</p>

<h3 id="e177">Tune: "Fairy of the Cave" - Xiling Sanitarium <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>North of Xiling Bridge, rising are exquisite pavilions and buildings, with six-pane glass windows facing the lake, as if heaven opens a painting. People are in a fairyland, just leaning against the mother-of-pearl stone. Qianjiao and Yu Huang mountains have good colors, and are just opposite the flying clouds and wavy reflections, wrinkled Luoxiu. The autumn water is as green as smoke. On the Willow Embankment, I am used to pulling painting boats to berth, making a neighbor of Su Xiaoxiao and Lin Bu. I wait to move my zither and wine pot, to accompany their plum blossoms and cranes.</p>
<p>How many generations of workers remember the past? Concealment of the seclusion is entangled with dust, suffering from the same disease. Let us steal a few days of leisure, take a rest, and come to drink wildly in the building outside the building, asking nothing about the rise and fall of the country. The Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties all perish the same way, in the water reflection. Only two snow-capped peaks are free to come and go, regardless of the cold Xiling wind. I listen to several chimes of the morning bells, all from the forest, their traces are not yet ripe, and the yellow millet dream should urge them to wake up.</p>

<p>— Xiao Cui</p>
<p>Green shade and drizzle set off the lake light, extending thousands of acres far away. The exquisite pagoda is thinner than bamboo shoots. The Zheng jade cup tries tea, really wrapping up the fragrance. Quietly, it is green to half the building. The mountain shadows are red, living near the water, the winding weeping willows absorb spring upside down. People enter the mandarin duck mirror. Taking a narrow-sleeved azure cloud with them, they load it on a short awning boat, and the pumpkin tendrils go to the clouds and waters to spend Qingming. There is mulberry leaf tea, and apricot blossoms stick.</p>

<p>Small jade hooks, silver garlic pressing down, when lotus petals open, they force the clear lake to narrow. A row of autumn rivers cascades from the edge of the sky, the people in the stone railings are clearer than doubles. A ci fairy is charming but unmarried, chewing pistils and blowing fragrance, every day in the red building. Towards evening, the wind on the sandbank gradually increases. Willow silk helps the peach blossom horse.</p>

<p>— Juemi</p>
<p>The national government, in its efforts to eliminate folk superstitions, has repeatedly admonished in recent years, no less than three orders and five declarations. However, folk superstition cannot be eliminated, especially in my hometown. I have lived at home for four months and seen that when people in my village fall ill, their families must first ask a female witch to see ghosts, and then ask a Taoist priest to pray, believing that all illnesses are caused by ghosts or afflicted by evil stars. Therefore, when a patient first falls ill, one only hears the cries of joy from the family, the sounds of Taoist priests' gongs and drums, and all kinds of superstitious acts such as sending ghosts, offering plays to thank the gods, asking for blessings, borrowing longevity from the public, and making wishes. When all this has no effect, they begin to ask a doctor to treat them. Therefore, when they finally call a doctor and take medicine, the patient's illness has often entered the marrow and cannot be treated. There are many cases where it is too late for treatment. A certain Gong, who sets up ropes and indulges in Shanghai for business, is not bad at his age. A son born at the age of 14 is like Shang Qu who first gave birth at the age of forty. Therefore, Zhong Ai is very special. Last month, his son became ill, so he also asked a female witch to see ghosts and a Taoist priest to pray. After the Taoist priest repeatedly resolved the stars and sent out orders, and the female witch repeatedly summoned the dead and捣鬼, his son's illness actually seemed to disappear. However, hundreds of gold had been spent in these one or two months. His son has recovered, but he is still afraid of being infertile. The foolish people in my village, when they give birth to children who are repeatedly infertile, after giving birth to children, either entrust the name to Guanyin or entrust the name to Guan Yu, entrusting the protection of gods and Buddhas. Gong then entrusted his son's name to the City God Temple in Hongqiao. The City God's Mansion and the Guanyin Bodhisattva of the Shantang Temple specially sent two plates of steamed buns and cakes to the City God on that day, and offered a banquet in front of the City God with the Geng Tie, just like those who entrust their names in the human world. And the City God also bestowed a name like the human world and issued a seal decree to Gong for collection. The decree said: "Regarding the matter of giving the seal decree, according to the report of citizen Gong Heyun, he secretly stated that the only son, Lingjiang, born at the age of 55, is only fourteen years old. In recent years, his fate has been fraught with disasters. He secretly thinks that the Gong family relies on this one son to inherit. Unexpectedly, the evil stars are multiplying and the demons of illness are following closely, which is deeply worrying. Therefore, he made a submission to the钧府, begging for permission to entrust the name, relying on Weiling to silently protect, etc. According to this thought, Gong Heyun loves his son sincerely and the ancestral temple is important, so he is allowed to entrust the name, bestowing the name Yongbao. From now on, your son will see this government as a father, and this government will see your son as a son. With the protection of this government, he will forever eliminate disasters and difficulties, and ensure that he is free from disease and pain. In the future, he will be intelligent and will surely become a son who crosses the stove, inheriting the cause. This government has high hopes." This decree, etc., is usually done by the abbot of the temple, but the abbot cannot write, so someone is asked to write it, which is really laughable.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Interesting Scraps in the Car <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Zuichi Sheng</p>
<p>On the morning of the other day, I went to Dingjia Village in Malu Township for a diagnosis, first taking the Beijing-Shanghai train to Nanxiang. During this one-hour train ride, I heard and witnessed many interesting scraps, which I will recount as follows:</p>
<p>It's hard for the villagers: The person sitting next to me was a villager in short clothes and rough clothes. Later, the villager suddenly stood up, and the seat was suddenly occupied by a certain Jia, and a clothing bag was placed next to it. The villager reasoned with him, but Jia scolded the villager. The villager had to stand there like a wooden chicken. Before long, a woman came slowly, looking for a seat. Jia hurriedly packed up his clothing bag and let the woman sit down. The onlookers laughed secretly. I said that all unfair things in the world should be viewed in this way.</p>
<p>Cigarette butt as a farewell gift: The people sitting opposite me were a couple, whispering sweet nothings to each other. The man was over forty, and the woman was also middle-aged, but still charming. The Wu dialect was so soft that it made people's hearts melt. When the car was about to start, the man hurriedly got off the car, reluctant to leave. He leaned out the window and said goodbye to the woman earnestly, his attitude indescribable. Then the car started. The woman threw the cigarette butt from her cherry lips to him remotely. The man picked it up and smoked it, its taste as sweet as can be. These old folks still have such heroic and unrestrained ambitions in crowded places, not afraid of being 肉麻. I can only repeatedly call out my admiration and surrender.</p>
<p>Suffering from smoke and fire: I have never smoked cigarettes in my life, but at that time, I was sitting bored in the carriage, as if I were a vast leader suffering from smoke and fire. Unfortunately, I am not blessed enough to enjoy it. The surrounding smoke and dust were overwhelming, making people cough and choke constantly. The people of our country have such a fondness for it. Don't they think that every wisp of smoke is transformed from countless amounts of money?</p>
<p>An old scholar sings a song to awaken the world: At that time, a song suddenly arose from one corner. The crowd looked at it and saw a person who looked like a scholar was writing a book and singing a mountain song to persuade the world. There was a sentence in it: "Putting Coptis chinensis on the tip of the nose is bitter in front of the eyes, hanging licorice on the back is sweet later." It is both interesting and thought-provoking. I said that this kind of slang song is the easiest to popularize, more beneficial than the "drizzling rain" and "Jiang Lao Wu" sung from house to house.</p>
<p>Buying a third-class ticket and taking a fifth-class car: At half past two in the afternoon, I took a car from Nanxiang back to Shanghai. The people getting on the car were extremely crowded. I climbed onto a car that looked like a freight car. The men, women, old, and young were planted full, filling every pit and valley. The crowd complained that buying a third-class ticket and taking such a car was really not worth it. I said that this can be called a fifth-class car because fourth-class cars still have seats, but this one has no seats at all. Why is it not a fifth-class car? However, everyone is treated equally and stands, so as to avoid competing for seats. Therefore, it can also be called an equal car. The crowd smiled and the complaints gradually subsided.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>The garden hangs a sign saying that tourists must not scare animals, otherwise they will be expelled. At the deer fence, two male deer are playing by butting each other's horns, while the doe roams leisurely. Seeing people coming, she greets them with her nose. It can be said that they are truly of the same group. No wonder the great舜 lived deep in the mountains and made friends with them, cultivating the saintly rule of禪讓. As for the male deer, they have nothing to do but enjoy fighting, while the antlerless female proves that the nature of a female is not to fight. My university is in animal society. I have long been a friend of the fawn at the Taiyuan Museum, so I feel this deeply and sigh that human morality is far inferior to that of birds and beasts. Therefore, I composed a poem. I have not met for a long time, but I now see Shun's friend. His innocence is truly brilliant, and he affectionately licks people's hands. His life is smooth and natural, and he cries to his mate. With few desires, he is easy to be content, and how can he have a scheming heart? A vegetarian is of good nature, and I feel that your face is kind.</p>
<p>Several does use their noses to nuzzle people. I then gave them green grass, and they slowly ate it. I then remembered that Master Wanhui also very much agreed with my theory that "humans are inferior to birds," saying that "the greatest evil in the world is none other than humans, and the most sinful of humans are the males who love to kill." This is Master Wanhui's judgment. I thought that the deer are so affectionate to people, but how can they know that humans have no good intentions towards all animals? Isn't it true that all horses, cattle, sheep, chickens, and dogs,凡near people, are all eaten for their meat and slept in their skin? Monkeys are very different. There are red-faced monkeys that are very similar to Sun Wukong with double pupils in the painting. There are also black pig monkeys that are very ugly. Generally, those who raise monkeys separate the males and females. The architecture of this garden is very large, with rooms above to avoid rain and iron barriers inside to divide them into multiple layers so that the monkeys can jump. In the past, I have seen many monkeys in the Beijing Zoo, and they are all made to jump on poles while wearing iron chains. When asked, the guard replied that it is inconvenient for these creatures, male and female, to gather in one place. Because of their lewd nature, they will often mate, which is unseemly for male and female tourists to see. From this, I can infer that the monkeys here must also be separated by male and female. Although, since Darwin, anthropologists must base their studies on animal society, especially the relationship between monkeys, apes, and society. Today, the principle of great equality between the sexes in our world is also based on animal sociology. In the past, someone in the education community said to me that if the education community wants to study psychology, it must first set up a monkey village and a children's village academy as the foundation for studying society and psychology. I think this plan should be considered by scholars all over the world, but</p>
<p>it is the foundation for studying humans, but the world rarely knows it.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Cui Xiu Tirelessly Asks for Words From Her Teacher, Chivalrous Heroines Talk About Military Affairs at a Brothel Feast</p>
<p>Time is something that no amount of force can stop. Gradually, it has turned from early winter to deep winter. However, the weather in the south, even in the dead of winter, is unpredictable. Sometimes, even after the winter solstice, it suddenly becomes as warm as early spring. But after the warmth, it suddenly changes, and freezing clouds gather, suddenly becoming snow-brewing weather, and it snows all day long. The preparations for winter in the south are not as good as in the north. In the north, almost every house has a stove in the winter, with thick door curtains hanging, and all the windows and doors are pasted up, not allowing a single wisp of wind to enter. Large-scale residences and hotels have long had steam pipes running throughout the room. At that time in Shanghai, only a few large foreign companies had this scale. All the large hotels enjoyed by the Chinese did not have steam pipes yet. Ordinary people had not even seen them. Even the stoves were not in every household. Only a group of Cantonese people had just arrived in Shanghai. They had always lived in the southern temperate zone. In the winter, they shivered like 煨　cats, wanting to get close to the stove. Many people in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces cannot stand the stove. After roasting in the stove, tomorrow they will have a sore throat and toothache. Only a few friends wearing suits must have a stove. Although their winter clothes are exquisite, they cannot compare to the warmth of Chinese clothes, especially on the lower body, with only a pair of single pants worn on a pair of legs, the same single pants in summer and the same single pants in winter, but the quality is different. The editorial department of the Ping Bao Pavilion also installed a stove. This was for the group of people in suits like Liu Xing-shu. Now that the number of people wearing suits is gradually decreasing, several gentlemen do not need the stove very much, unless it is after late at night that they teach the waiter to light the stove. However, there are several people wearing suits who often come to play at the Ping Bao Pavilion. Among them, there is one named Ye, called Ye Haoran. He is a graduate of Japan. He is short and capable, but he is wise and resourceful. He originally studied commerce in Japan and received a bachelor's degree in commerce. After returning to China, he wanted to be active in domestic commerce, but he often went to the Ping Bao Pavilion with people like Ling Zhixiang and Long Ziyun. When it comes to eating dinner, he is also a newly joined member. Moreover, he often makes a fuss about treating guests. Before departing, he must make an appointment with a group of people in advance, saying that today's host is me, and everyone should not搶. If it is once or twice, everyone agrees to disturb him. If the number of times he treats guests increases, everyone says that we cannot disturb you alone. Let's take turns treating. When they arrive at some restaurant, he is still very powerful. He orders, and after he audits the bill, others cannot pay it.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Financial and Gold Market Closes Higher <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Compared to yesterday, the closing price increased by three taels and six qian. Yesterday, the 28th, the gold market situation experienced slight changes. It was stable in the morning, then declined, improved at noon, and finally trended upwards. The market was confusing and unpredictable. The total market movement was over six taels, making it difficult to predict. Market sentiment turned from bad to good. Foreign exchange seemed to strengthen. Banks bought and sold repeatedly. Dealers in the market bought and sold differently. Fuchang, Yuanheng, Yufa, Yongyuan, Chengyong, and others all bought in, while Dadecheng, Yuanmao, Yongwupin, and the Dalian group sold. Although the overseas silver market rose slightly, it did not affect the gold market. The gold price remained firm. The sellers were agile, eager to sell downstream, and suddenly the price dropped to 81 taels and zero. Later, Fuchang and Yuanheng used exchange ticket hedging and other buying interests, causing the price to suddenly turn upwards, soaring five or six taels. However, the price fluctuated rapidly, with a two-tael correction at times, mainly because the funds of various firms were different. In the afternoon, goods were released and then taken back in. Taikang, Runcheng, Fengyong, Yuanyong, Xingyong, and others all bought in, while Fuchang, Yuanheng, and Dadecheng had already sold off. The situation gradually turned from weak to strong. Exchange tickets were also tight, but remained within one tael. Finally, it closed above 87 taels. Overall, the large firms' selling pressure had eased, and there seemed to be a rebound. This morning, large bars may see a slight decline.</p>
<p>Stable, then declined, then stable again. The opening price for January was 583 taels and seven qian, slightly lower by two qian. The gross price was initially five taels and seven or eight qian, but later goods came to be sold, dropping to three taels and eight or nine qian. Regarding the large bars, the silver was expected to rise last night, but only increased by one-sixteenth. There was no market for the silver price. Later, Zhifeng, Yongjin, Anwanxing, Tongtaichang, Shunli, and others sold off, so the price</p>
<p>fell from 84 taels and one qian to 81 taels and two qian. Later, Datong and Huabi sold to Zhengjin and Shanghai, etc. December British gold was 17125, Mitsui bought January Citibank 38.875, and Yuanheng, Fuchang, Yuancheng, Yong, and others came to buy in, so it has already risen. The increase was over three taels. At the time of the first order announcement, it was 84 taels and six or seven qian. However, the listed price did not change. Internally, Huabi sold January British gold 17125, and then fell back five or six qian, totaling four taels one or two qian. At that time, Mitsui absorbed November Dalian 1.2 taels eight fen 0.0625, and also released next month 1.2 taels eight fen two or five. Yufa and Yongfuchang Hongli all bought in. Around 10:00, it was 6 taels and 1 qian. Dadecheng and others sold off on the market, totaling a decrease of one tael zero. At 10:15, it was four taels eight or nine qian. Yuanheng and others' buying interest did not diminish, and there were also hedges coming to buy, so it rose two taels. At 11:00, it was six taels and eight qian. Afterwards, it floated and was unsettled, rising and falling suddenly totaling one tael. The foreign exchange market was stable. Zhengjin bought Dalian 1.2 taels eight fen two or five. Macgalie bought January and March British gold 17125. The gold price hovered around 86 taels. After 11:30, Zhengjin ate December 170625, and Sumitomo ate March 17125. On the table, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Zhifeng, Yong, Taikang, Run, and others were tireless in their buying intentions, so they raised the price by more than one tael, reaching seven taels and a half. Suddenly, Yuanmaoyong and goods suddenly sold off, and market sentiment collapsed, falling back one tael zero. At the noon closing, it was six taels and three qian, and then suppressed to five taels five or six qian. The goods were seven qian smaller than the Bund button. The opening price was still 627 taels, a decrease of over 42 taels to 29 and a half. At noon, 40 taels outside, fluctuations were impermanent and extremely chaotic. The afternoon opening price was 85 taels and a half, and then fell from five taels seven or eight qian to five taels three qian. Then retail customers sold off, and it was the remaining momentum after the noon closing. Yuandayong and others bought in, and Mitsui bought the current Dalian 1.2 taels eight fen three or seven five, and then it was added to 86 taels and six qian. Before long, it went down four or five qian to six taels one qian. After 2:30, Xiyutai, Runcheng, and Fengyong bought in, and Huabi ate January British gold 17125, and the industry also picked up March, totaling 170625, so the gold price jumped more than one tael to seven taels and six qian. Shortly after, it was suppressed by about two qian. The bank mutually made January 170625, and then March was made at the same price, especially by the Dalian gang, so the price increased by one tael. After 3:00 it was seven taels and eight qian. Afterwards, there were fluctuations of seven or eight qian. At 4:00, it suddenly turned downward, and Yuancheng, Yongzhifengyong, Hengxing, goods, etc. sold off one after another. March's first order was from Macgalie and Mitsui, issuing 170625. In an instant, one tael seven or eight qian was cut off. At 4:10 it was only 86 taels.

Fuchang, Yuanheng, Yufa Yong, Yifeng Yong, Yu Da, Zhifeng Yong, Dakang Run, and Yuancheng Yong all bought in. Fuyu Yongfeng, Daheng Yuan, and Hongli's fund situations varied.

<h3 id="e185">Foreign Exchange: Chinese Merchants First Sell, Then Settle <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Market sentiment improves, and silver bars are expected to decline.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market weakened. There was no market for long-term exchange. The HSBC listed foreign exchange was completely unchanged. The bank's internal market was initially stable, then tightened slightly with some fluctuations. In the afternoon, it was even better, probably because the gold market rebounded. Demand from colleagues exceeded supply, but there was confusion and panic. Throughout the day, there were several taels of returns, making it difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Chinese gold merchants sold some in the morning and settled again in the afternoon. Overall, sales exceeded purchases. A total of 300,000 pounds of British gold were traded. Banks such as Zhengjin, Mai Bank, Huabi, and Sumitomo all bought in. In the afternoon, Mitsui, Hefeng, and Macgalie sold some. Foreign and Sino-Japanese banks mutually traded tens of thousands of pounds. Mitsui slightly sold more than 100,000 yuan of US dollars. The Dalian gang sold the current Dalian hundreds of thousands of yuan, which was bought by Mitsui and Zhengjin. The gold industry's British gold transactions were largely hedging gold. As a result, compared to the previous evening, British gold narrowed by 125, US dollars narrowed by 375, and Japanese gold rose by one point. Market sentiment seemed to ease. This morning (the 29th), the silver market may rebound, but without much change.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Large Silver Bars Near and Far Rise <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to the London Guo Telegraph, large silver bars all saw rebounds. The near term increased by .0625, or 16 pence 5625 (equivalent to British gold for one shilling open pence 5625). The distant term also increased by .0625, totaling sixteen pence 4375. The ground China had slightly purchased. The market situation remained calm. There were no special changes after closing. US silver prices and the US to British Japanese market had no market because it was Citibank's holiday. British to US remained unchanged at 4 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen 5625. British Japanese remained at 2 shillings 032 parts of 17. The London Shanghai shilling was still 1 shilling 7 pence 25. Mumbai suspended operations. The reply has not changed.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Securities Settlement: Foreign Exchange Especially Prosperous <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The interest rate fell by more than a penny. Silver lending recovered a few points.</p>
<p>The general market situation is that as the end of the month approaches, securities for the entire month must be settled. The price of the loan depends on foreign funds to turn over. The silver money industry has a very large number of pledges and transactions for this item, so foreign loans are particularly prosperous during each settlement period. Because of the market sentiment this time, the bulls came out, so the foreign loans became more abundant. There were more sales than purchases in the afternoon market, so the interest rate plummeted by more than one penny. Silver lending was slightly better in the circling.</p>
<p>Interest rate and lending prices (Foreign Penny): The morning interest rate was 7 qian 2 fen 5, and the afternoon market suddenly dropped by 1 penny 2 hao and a half to 7 qian 2 fen 3 hao and a half. The softness of people's hearts is visible. (Silver Lending): The morning was quite strong. Transfer silver lending was all 1 qian 5 fen, which was 6 fen better than the morning market of the previous day. The afternoon market repeated the low and loose state, changing to 1 qian 1 fen. Halfway through, it was done at 1 qian. The bank listed 6 fen, added water, and the line was always white.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: Because there was no transaction in either market for Jiangnan small foreign coins, the market price also did not change, and it was all 6 qian 4 fen 5 li and a half. Guangdong small foreign coins were 6 qian 4 fen 5 li 2 hao in the morning market. Because the supply and demand were limited and the transactions were sparse, the market price was the same as the morning market. There were 45,000 jiao traded in the morning market and 20,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins shrank 1,500 wen again to 381,000 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Ocean Ins and Outs (Silver Loan): Banks' receipts and releases are not very numerous due to the fact that the end of the period is not far away for various routine receipts and releases, but the settlement of loans is particularly frequent. It is estimated that Chinese merchants received and released more than 2.5 million bills of exchange, and foreign merchants received and released more than 1.2 million bills of exchange. Various goods, foreign exchange taxes, and other miscellaneous loans received and released 12.34 million, special loans received and released 2.56 million, settlement loans received and released 4.5 million, 1.8 million were released from the warehouse, Japanese merchant banks received and released 4.7 million of various loans, settlement loans received and released more than 1.1 million, and 400,000 were released from the warehouse.

The morning market traded 30,000 in banknotes, and the afternoon market traded 20,000. Off-site banknotes traded 175,000 in the morning market and 110,000 in the afternoon market. Because it was securities settlement day, there were many buyers and sellers. The early market of bank trading traded 1.05 million in the inter-market and 900,000 in the afternoon market. In addition, 670,000 was opened. Foreign accounts of various banks received and released more than 3.4 million, banknotes received and released more than 2 million, customer sources more than 30,000, and stomach removal 40,000.

<p>Yongan received the most goods ｀｀｀ The deliverer was also the factory.</p>
<p>The November standard yarn was quite unstable at the beginning of the month. In fact, the current yarn had various demand, and the underlying goods gradually increased. According to Japanese merchants' investigations, there were about 160,000 to 170,000 bales. In addition, the world's cotton was declining and weak, and the pressure was heavy. Chao merchants and Japanese merchants sold a very large number of bales. As a result, the market was softer. However, a certain manufacturer's pulling force on the buying side was still strong and refused to let go. US cotton had a slight rebound, rising by 50 to 60 pounds, and the highest price was also seen at 150 taels. Before long, because the actual demand did not move and some manufacturers had a negative attitude, all the purchased goods were sold off and settled. The market turned sharply downward. This month, the Hengda manufacturers delivered 3,000 bales, and the delivery was sufficient. Therefore, people's hearts became more and more empty, and the lowest price was once seen at 142 taels and 6 qian.</p>
<p>In the last round, retail investors were squeezed out and rose back by one tael and two qian. As a result, the settlement price was 144 taels, totaling 7,200 bales with a total value of 1,036,80 taels. The Yongan factory received the most goods, and the delivery was also done by the factory. The actual delivery was 3,800 bales, and the dealers delivered 3,400 bales.</p>
<p>The goods included 20-count Five Blessings 2,150 bales, Shepherd 150 bales, 10-count Earth 500 bales, Three Sheep 1,000 bales. The receiving and delivering parties' dealer numbers and bale numbers are listed below.</p>

<p>Price 32 taels and a half ｀｀ Quantity 10700 dan. In the early part of November, the local standard market was extremely lackluster. The world cotton market did not move, and the current cotton needs of various factories were completely stagnant. The market sentiment was sluggish. The price hovered around 2 taels. Later, because there were disturbances from bandits on the Han Road, the source of goods was obstructed, and various local farmers refused to sell. Also, retail investors released too many quotas, and there were very few deliveries. As a result, the buying side was said to be squeezed, and the situation became increasingly tense. Both US and Indian cotton also hovered without moving. The market sentiment was once firm, and the highest price was once reached at 33 taels and 3 qian. Later, because the current cotton of various factories still did not improve, and the price of Indian cotton was low, various foreign firms were extremely willing to accommodate. Once the price was high, sales became even more stagnant, and cracks appeared in the market. Although the delivery was not enthusiastic, there was also a lack of receiving. Two yarn factories gave up and had no intention of receiving. The weekend suddenly fell, and the final closing price was only 32 taels. The result of the settlement price was 32 taels and 5 qian. The delivered goods were all fire machine white cotton. The number of settlements totaled 10700 dan. The actual 7000+ dan was delivered by Dafeng 7200 dan being the most. Jifeng received 2600 dan and Rongxing received 1700 dan. The dealer numbers and bale numbers of the receiving and delivering parties are listed below.</p>

<p>The yarn market is generally weak, and the sales of current yarn are increasingly bleak. All gangs are lifeless, so people's hearts are softened. In this month's settlement, there were 500 bales of 10-count Earth yarn. This batch of goods has a problem because it has been too long since the settlement. It was found that there are more than 20,000 bales of 20-count Five Blessings, Shepherd, and 10-count stagnant goods in the yarn and cloth warehouse. Currently, the market is being suppressed by them and it is difficult to turn around for a while. Most must see 140 taels. In short, the "current yarn" sales are still sluggish. It was found that the total number of bales bought by each gang throughout the day was 470. The market conditions were generally flat. Among the customer gangs, Sichuan entered 300 bales, Xuzhou entered 20 bales, inland entered 75 bales, Xiamen entered 5 bales, Wuhu entered 5 bales, Hankou entered 25 bales, and Jiangxi entered 40 bales. The "current cotton" business is completely cut off, and there is no source of business on the market. It is estimated that there are 220 bales of Yao cotton and 360 bales of Tong cotton.</p>

<p>The South Market Feels Slightly Softer</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, a total of more than 30 rice boats arrived. The market sales were very flat. White japonica rice had been bid up by the sellers at the beginning, but because the outflow was extremely light, the market continued to be flat. At present, the specially top japonica rice still hovered around 14 yuan and 8 jiao. People's hearts were not good, and the general trend was not easy to flourish. There were inquiries about mutton scented and Du scented rice on this street, and customers also asked slightly. In addition, the source was not strong, the market situation was firm and stable, and the price was the same as the previous day. Gaokai twelfth yuan on the left side of the pass retail because the goods were scarce and smart, the market of indica rice is very active also. The sale of light rice is sluggish, and the arriving goods have slightly reduced the price by a few points. Gaokai twelfth yuan, four or five jiao, changed the Yuan back to one jiao. The buying interest was very quiet. Gaokai fifteen yuan zero Yin Yuan has always been mediocre, still at the spectrum of 13 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, the source of rice from Downriver was more than 20, and the sales were not good. Changxi top japonica rice was not much in the market, but the appetite of all parties was not strong, causing a slight modification of the recent angle. The customs goods are all under the angle outside. As for Sutong and other japonica rice, they are very stagnant, and zero sales go without chemical change. The market sees the half angle softened, but such special high goods are still fixed. N帮 Qingding, Sijing, Liantang and other light rice and early rice big plate has not much change, but the market situation is clearly determined and secretly loose. The top light rice barely opens twelve yuan on the left side of the pass, and the sales of mutton scented rice are still flourishing. Du Point zero also accepts the market situation is determined and changed to Yin. The Yin 化 arrives at the end of the two poles is also lacking in honor and disgrace.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Customer Scented Arrival and Sales are Both Strong <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the customer scented appetite on this street was slightly active, but the arrival also saw an increase. The market was still flat. In addition, the supply of medium-grade goods was more than the stock, which was not as good as the high-end goods with a foothold. The original arrival was slightly, but the appetite of the North Gang was still good. Yesterday, the Qingdao gang continued to handle nearly 100 bales of Jiangxi machine yuan at a price of 14 yuan, 1 jiao and 2 fen. Customer scented rice was entirely chemical on this street, totaling 350 bales of Jiangxi machine early, 250 bales of Hunan machine Jing, 400 bales of Nanjing machine rice, and 250 bales of brown rice.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the powder market opened in the upper and lower afternoon, and each month presented a near-flat and distant-downward trend. This month, the long-short chips have generally been straightened out. Although the environment is not very good, the stock of powder in each factory is still limited. A part of the manufacturers also allow customer gangs to casually draw and buy in advance, so the ending of this month is relatively stable. After all, when futures arrive, settlement must be based on actual goods. As for the distant futures months, the canned quotation was again 70-80 jiao small, and the industry's internal and external hearts were still not strong. Sellers released files in large numbers, causing each disk to gradually open and fall. It can be seen that the market in the month of release may need 1 qian to enter the customs. The knot stays this month only small two centimeters and a half compared to the previous day. December and January are both small one centimeter and a half. The February is small two centimeters, three or four months</p>
<p>shares are small two centimeters and two centimeters and a half.</p>

At the beginning of the opening, the buying interest was not strong and the people's hearts were still stable. Then, the big households' short appreciation overseas wheat was again small seven or eight jiao, and the pressure of throwing was still very smooth. The general multi-head saw that the China factory's delivery of overseas wheat was unrestricted</p>
<p>The darkness of the future is naturally heavier, so the pace also anti-step does not turn back. Since the multiple and short competed to come out, the affected households were even rarer. Therefore, the market fell sharply again, especially December was even more serious. Looking at the future situation, perhaps it will fall to 4 taels. As a result, December fell 8 fen, January</p>
<p>fell 6 fen, February fell 7 fen, March and April fell 6 fen. The current wheat market is very lazy due to the factory appetite, and there are few high-quality goods. The entire city only opened 700 bales of medium-grade Mingguang wheat, which was handled by Huafeng.</p>

The city traded a thousand boxes, the transactions are not very lonely, but the batch price is lower, Zhen Mei is still depressed, Qining black tea is also无人问津. Luezhuang tuzhuang zhucha Tongfu Foreign Trade also restored operation, market plate has not changed. The rest Zhen Mei, embroidery eyebrows and other items, although British firms have a slight need, but mostly to supplement the missing number of properties, there is no large number of go.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Depressed State of Both Chinese and Foreign Cloth Goods <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>The cloth market of our factory has trended loose again. Fine cloth has fallen by two and a half points, and coarse twill by a small five points. The formerly out-of-stock nine-pound coarse cloth has also gradually increased in quantity. Dragon and Five Bats are both quoted at four taels, three mace, and two and a half fen. Goods from Hubei arrive in increasing quantities daily, with "Tian" brand opening at eight taels and seven mace, "Horse Race" brand at eight taels and one and a half mace, and "Lu" brand at seven taels and seven and a half mace. Northern merchants have slightly purchased, but fine twill has a strong downward trend. The reason for this is the impact of year-end account settlements for the traditional Chinese calendar year. There is little hope for transactions within the year, so those holding goods are very apprehensive. Observation suggests that it will be difficult to reverse the downward trend in the short term.</p>
<p>Due to the warmer weather, the daily sales of Eastern fabrics have been sluggish, greatly affecting the business of stores. Therefore, velvet and other Eastern goods have started to fall again. "Wind and Waves" velvet continued to soften yesterday, with black flower continuing to be uniform, a small drop of one mace and eight and a half fen, and large flowers all selling for one mace and nine and a half fen. The upward trend of colored striped velvet has also stopped, with "Divine Arrow Yang Guifei" both opening at six taels and seven and a half mace. Only double-width thick camel velvet remains firm, with "Ming Fu Lu Shou" opening at eight mace and five fen. Sichuan merchants have purchased quite a bit of old-fashioned tribute broadcloth. Transactions in this street are quite active, with fifty or sixty pieces being sold. The price of bald red is three mace and two and a half fen, and colored tribute broadcloth has not stopped falling and has returned to two mace and two or three fen. The current transactions of Western goods are very pessimistic. Thick tribute broadcloth, Western satin, and yuan silk arrive in small quantities and are not selling well.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Rising Market for Hardware American Tinplate <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Previously, the market for American tinplate was quiet, and arrivals surged, with stockpiles sufficient for several months of sales. In recent days, because the company's iron has reached its peak price, customers mostly buy American tinplate because of the high price. Therefore, the market is as active as that for eighteen-sheet black iron. However, after several rounds of procurement, the supply of goods has become scarce, and standards are rising steadily. The current price of ninety-pound iron is fourteen taels and eight and a half mace, more than four mace higher than before, and one hundred pounds is sixteen taels, also two mace and a half higher than before. It is said that egg factories, tobacco companies, canning factories, etc., have all been buying and selling for several days. The market has opened up to 1,800 or 1,900 boxes in the past three or four days, so the market is quite optimistic.</p>

This price is indeed only one-third of the original price.</p>
<p>The Zhongxi Pharmacy on Sima Road announced that the current grand sale and free gift event has been extremely well received by all sectors. Due to the vastness of Shanghai and the large number of merchants, many have been disappointed.

<p>The Tongchang Motor Company on Nanjing Road announced that it will hold a 33rd-anniversary grand sale starting tomorrow.

After the expiration date, an impartial person will draw a day from the discount period, and the company will return the full amount of cash from that day, based on the invoice, in the original foreign currency. If the business income on that day is 10,000 yuan, the company will completely sacrifice 10,000 yuan. This grand event is truly good news for those purchasing vehicles.</p>
