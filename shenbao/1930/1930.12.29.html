<h3>推行國曆演講大會</h3>
<p>昨日開始講演昨請蔡元培先生演講謂國曆遠勝陰曆各界應切實奉行今日上午十點鐘敦請褚民誼講演昨日爲上海各界慶祝國曆新年籌備委員會開始舉行推行國曆講演大會之第一天籌委會特請蔡元培先生蒞市黨部三樓講演推行國曆問題當到聽講人衆凡三百餘人由市宣傳部部長楊清源主席報告講演大會之意義并介紹蔡先生之道德文章畢即請蔡先生講演詞極懇切動聽今日上午十時繼續舉行講演會已請定褚民誼先生講演各界均可派員聽講</p>
<p>蔡元培先生之講辭蔡先生講詞節錄如次主席諸位同志今天在座各位對於推行國曆都很熱心并深有研究今天我想說的祇不過作一個討論罷了今天討論的問題便是怎樣推行國曆換句話說便是用什麽方法去推行國曆我覺得推行國曆第一要注意的便是使民衆心誠悅服地來奉行國曆事實上現在固帶着强制的性質不過我們出去宣傳講演却應該使人家心誠悅服地來信仰你在以前不呌國曆呌皇曆牠的曆法是按照朝代而改變的這一個人做了皇帝他便把前朝的衣服禮儀以及政法等都加以改變就是曆法也要變更那時中國的曆法祇有一個陰曆是以月爲根據而訂定的後因與事實不符所以加上閏月這個改革在以前已很不容易發明的了不過在縱的組織方面大家都認爲陰曆已很完備而無庸疑的那麽換朝代時用何法來變更呢夏朝建寅即陰曆正月爲一年之開始商朝以十一月爲歲之開始周朝以十二月爲歲始到秦時崇尙新法那時的一般方士或陰陽家羣倡金木水火土即有所調金尅木火尅金之類漢朝以後信仰孔子的學說所以這種風氣便慢慢消滅呂不韋著呂氏春秋時便確定以建寅爲正統一季分孟仲季等三時以春爲歲首這種辦法直至清代始終如一到中華民國成立後總理主張改用陽曆他的用意並非是古代換朝代而改曆法的意思而是發現陰曆有許多不好的地方陽曆有許多長處的緣故陽曆固然不能算完備無缺譬如現在有許多人在研究說四星期爲一月十三月爲一年一年有五天爲紀念日這呌　通曆這方法固很方便因爲不像陽曆有廿八日　日一日之麻煩難記不過此法尙未到可應用的時期還是研究的問題暫擱而勿論民元時總理所以要採用陽曆實爲了適合經濟制度如預算等項他的目的完全爲了民衆的利益起見並不是包含着皇曆的意義在内這是我們應該瞭解的第一點有人疑惑應用陽曆是學時髦譬如上海有許多人說話商興夾幾句英語穿衣服喜歡穿洋裝（這點要聲明）洋服自比中服便利我個人所以不穿洋服因爲國貨少有毛織品的關係）也以爲我們提倡國曆是學時髦了其實這是大謬而不然的要曉得陽曆完全是根據天文學加以理性方面之研究而産的是最合理的辦法並非盲目的學外人這是我們應該注意的第二點同時我們還該瞭解的就是我們中國實際上早在用陽曆譬如一年二十四節若春分等是完全應用陽曆的道理農人於幾月幾日播種幾月幾日耘田幾月幾日收獲他是不知道的他完全依據節氣來計算以節氣而論節氣合陰曆月日常相差數日甚至一月陽曆則無此弊故中國向來奉行陰曆其實應用節氣實已陰陽合用所以現在我們用陽曆並非學外人而是在全世界各種曆法中擇一最合理最科學的曆法以爲應用上之便利與準確並非盲從是出於自已挑選這是第三點我們該明白的不過在努力奉行國曆的時候我們熱心宣傳的同志有幾點應注意到第一農村與都市在生活上有一點不同都市中各工廠各機關都可星期休息在鄉村則不然在農忙的時候不要說一天八小時十小時甚至十四小時也不以爲怪在没事的時候終日閑空也無足爲奇在播種加服料時農人無錢甚至當衣押物重利告貨收穫以後方可還債贖物這時農村方面的金錢自農民而入小錢莊由小錢莊而入大錢莊以至銀行於是一切人欠欠人都可告一總結束故此次各地商會請中央解帳期改至二月十五日中央所以予以許可者即在此不過過年結賬自當遵奉國歷而行退一步講解賬日期本可隨時規定例如僨項約期以及中秋端午等節的結賬無足爲奇以學校而論推行國歷更没有什麽妨碍不過學生回家省親的日期提早些罷了在機關辦事的人更没有什麽不妨便之處至於農民他們在國歷二月方有閒暇這時他們休息政府當然聽任他們的自由决不加以干涉其他若祖先之提早祭祀等更無問題按照事實而論陽歷比陰歷要好得多例如陰歷有閏月一年有十三個月以學校言敎科書之編制敎員授課之鐘點就生問題以工商界言薪金工資等也要多一個月並且奉行國歷後封建勢力與迷信習慣也可逐漸廢除正和首都在南京而不在北平含有同樣的意義這雖不能一蹴而就不過經年累月以後自可達到目的并以大及小政府機關奉行影響所及就可漸漸普及民間大銀行奉行後自可使都市以及内地的小錢莊都慢慢奉行其他像提倡慶祝國歷新年等事宜都可帮助國歷的推行上海南京現在都組織籌備會專司其事那更好了今天報上看見上海元旦日有電影之放映游藝塲之開放等都是新年中娱樂的很好辦法政府法令是嚴厲施行黨是政治之靈魂同時黨員好像是民衆的慈母當然應該以慈愛的態度使一般民衆奉行總之宣傳國歷推行的方法最重要之一點在於說明國歷之好處使民衆感覺到陰歷之短處那麽推行國歷這一件事自無問題至於宣傳的技巧方面各位都很明白不多說了希望大家以至善的努力去宣傳奉行國歷完了（國民社按此稿由記者怱促整理就緒未經孑民先生修正故有謬誤之處由記者負責寒梅附識）</p>

<h3>爭錦標各逞身手</h3>
<p>昨日之戰有關本屆錦標榮譽雙方戰士各逞身手以决勝負觀於六對一之比數形若一面倒之局勢實則時時刻刻莫不在緊張空氣之中也嶺南守門唐永純球藝純熟手脚靈巧每能於絶處中打出生路誠英才也其他如左前中衛之陳璞中鋒之陳洪光極有作爲不同凡嚮至眞茹人才陳鎭和戴麟經江善敬成績超衆推爲巨　左右翼頗有貢獻兩内鋒亦甚活動錦標之得實爲理所當然</p>
<h3>唐守門力拒强敵</h3>
<p>裁判員何春輝宣戰令起嶺南撥球進取球爲敵截自左入侵唐守門接之出險轉予前方陳洪光匹馬探險打出門外眞茹再度興兵嶺南門前突起風浪宰而抵禦有方球又反趨陳鎭和指揮前鋒三軍用命未幾　攻龍門密如雨點唐守門力拒强敵厥功甚偉</p>
<h3>陳鎭和奪得頭功</h3>
<p>嶺南得守門之堅固外有諸將之嚴防半壁江山　賴以保存者有三十分之久大非易事迨至左内衛在十八碼處犯規始由陳鎭和打入一球眞茹此後之軍勢益現兇猛唐守門身當其衝無片刻之息童榮文戴麟經陳鎭祥先後射擊準而有勁咸未得手者守門之力也至最後五分鐘羅海光童榮文一頂一脚告均成功上半時眞茹以三對零佔前</p>
<h3>再戰起連遭不幸</h3>
<p>再戰之初眞茹一擁入内童榮文一脚提起球入網内𨳨眼之間球又自右方飛來戴麟經加上一撥龍門又破二球之失似在五分鐘之内也此後局勢眞茹仍占優勢但以嶺南把守有方難以進展十分鐘時嶺南前鋒忽得勢一鼓而下幸而眞茹守門眼快手快方得化險爲夷至三十分鐘時羅海光又打中一球造成六對零之比數</p>
<h3>掙扎中奪回一球</h3>
<p>嶺南固非弱者累次進兵奮發有爲所以半途中止功虧一簣者中衛所處地位過於落後善於退守不利於進取也但其在最後十五鐘内掙扎甚力陳璞在場之左中區點踼任意球落點甚佳落於門前卓國榮不負使命提起一脚正中門内奪回一球結果督茹以六對一得勝</p>
<h3>樂華昨日慘敗</h3>
<p>一比五敗於上海西人隊西人甲組賽之一幕樂華對上海西人隊昨戰於申園足球塲此爲西人會甲組賽之一幕結果上海隊以五比一勝觀者不滿千人樂華球員臨時拉攏生張熟魏聨絡匪易克敵制勝更非可能其號召力乃致大减而觀衆猶不諒之惡言謾駡令人難堪回想昔日之雄能不令人興今昔之感雙方陣線如下</p>
<h3>上海隊</h3>
<p>費考斯史篤克　蘇墨　柯爾巧陶樂爾　摩洛　辛克萊法平　歇茀　包德享白勃萊</p>
<h3>樂華隊</h3>
<p>楊人偉關洵安　高大韓　周紹文周賢言　沈觀瀾　陸鍾恩王樹森　金鳳德　李琳陳虞添</p>
<h3>上海一刻鐘勝兩球</h3>
<p>列陣交鋒上海隊右翼白勃萊於七八分鐘時即攻入樂華一球未幾碧眼右翼白氏復傳球與右内鋒包德亨包飛起一服脚樂華周鐵門阻擋不及又負一球離前僅六分鐘耳樂華遭此挫折奮勇反攻無如力不從心每阻於敵門前罰球線外格格不入奈何不得</p>
<p>[P樂華隊又失第三球</p>
<p>混戰聲中忽警笛大鳴於場外馬路上塲内西捕均登看台之高最級引領遙望聲起於四角座看台後面觀衆亦莫不居高臨下一覩究竟羣置球賽於不顧上海隊斯時續得第三球中鋒辛克萊之功也</p>
<h3>下半時樂華獲一球</h3>
<p>下半時樂華忽逞鋒芒盤球進展右翼陳虞添遠射陸鍾恩楊人偉等均加鞭追上陸　身躍起意欲運用其頭上功夫上海守門陶樂爾向少活動機會此時禍起倉卒不禁意馬心猿進退遲疑及迎前爭扎爲時已晚球乃滑入門内從此皆大歡笑空氣忽然緊張</p>
<h3>上海卒以五比一勝</h3>
<p>從此樂華更爲努力屢次進逼上海防區多難奈樂華射擊軟弱難於建樹上海隊否極泰來一轉　問連得兩球一爲中鋒辛氏踼入一爲中堅摩洛打中同時上海左後衛受傷離塲祇十人作戰相持結果成五與一之比樂華慘敗裁判員樂秀榮</p>

<h3>書報介紹</h3>
<p>中國近代經濟發展史湯彬候厚培著我國雖然是基於農業的國家但是爲了不平等條約之縳束外來的經濟的威力在不斷地侵略所以無論那一種産業都落於　它國家之後像這等事言之實令人痛心因爲祇要經濟這條繩索纒於我們的國家其它的種種外來侵略　逺　亦足以使本國的一切陷於不振落後的地步這當然我們是不能目覩自已的國家永此下去這種使本國的經濟力量有所進展的責任一般有血性的愛護自已所屬國的人是應該深深地負起的這不得不對於本國與經濟發展有關係的重大問題最基本地研究起不可實際我國在這種情形之下實無經濟發展的可言但是自清末以來經濟界亦可以說是具有相當的進步這是不可諱言的事實不過關於此項材料是没有學者來搜集此項最基本的屬於本國的重大的問題也没有學者來加以深刻的探求這是我們引爲最大的缺陷的但是候君此書的問世便把此種我們引爲最大的缺陷是補足無遺的了</p>
<p>全書計分爲八章第一章（人口之變遷是把我國土地的面積加以正確的估計爲使者讀明白起見便將中國所有的省分條叙述極爲　　　　　要的我國邊塞如青海西藏等地的面積作者亦作有根據的估計徵引外人所估定者作與我國所測量的互相比較藉以明瞭其中的究竟關於此足以表示本書之專長土地的面積旣然有所瞭然了之後其次須迫切明白的即是人口的統計了作者對於此項統計是追溯於三代以來據文獻通考及二十四史所載加以最近的正確的調查互相作比較的研究並將其中所統計的缺點與其總數的不準確都加以詳細的探求藉以明白其眞相這研求的結果當然是可得到一較確實的統計了根據着各省人口的總數與及各省土地面積的計算便成爲人口的密度作者對於此例了一個極形詳細的表可以使我們明白何省的人口密度爲多何省又分配的太不平均這種深刻的印象看了作者所例之表便能取得了的人口移動的狀態也是極形重要的這狀態可分爲兩種一種爲移入一種爲移出這對於自已國度的領土華僑在海外的情形以及國際上的種種問題都有關係所以此節作者所述尤爲詳盡亦附有表格以醒讀者的閱看這實是很值得我們注意的</p>
<p>第二章爲（農業的情形）我國是農業國那麽最重要的産業當然是農業了這在我國是已有五千多年的歷史所以此種情形更該加以深刻的注意在起先作者將農田的面積以及歷代田畝的數目最近代的是根據農商部所製成的各省區的報告加以正確的統計並分省叙述尤屬不易其次是通農家的户數農佃制度的變遷與及主要農産的情形都有詳細的發揮尤其是最後一節分米　　　等叙述各地産生的多寡大都以例表藉以比較的第三章機械工業的進步因爲我國的工業在極形糼稚的時代但是近年以來處於列强的經濟侵略的情形之下全國人士是已覺悟到非振興工業而不足以自存的積極地提倡當然是不無相當的進步的所以此章在全書中也是極形重要的作者先述工業發展的起原其次將棉織毛織麵粉鋼鐵水泥與及化業等等工業的勃興進步狀况和發展都加以分别的叙述更形詳盡無遺的</p>
<p>第四章爲（貨幣制度的改良）計分六節（一）吾國前代的幣制（二）清末幣制改良的動機（三）金匯兌本位的建議時代（四）衛士林氏幣制改革的主張（五）民國初元幣制委員會的成績（六）最近整理幣制的設施第五章爲（近代銀行的發展）計分四節（一）中央銀行制度的變遷（二）地方銀行的制度（三）内國銀行的發展（四）在華外國銀行的勢力第六章爲一國際貿易的發展）計分七節（一）通商以前的國際貿易（二）通商以後貿易權的旁落（三）近六十四年來國際贸易的趨勢（四）入口贸易的分析觀（五）出口贸易的分析觀（六）貿易國别的分析觀（七）海關稅收的情形第七章爲近代交通的進步）計分四節（一）鐵路的發展（二）電政的發展（三）郵政的發達（四）航業的情形第八章爲（中國近代的勞動運動）計分五節（一）近代勞動問題的來源（二）中國的勞動制度（三）勞動者的數量與生活狀况（四）勞動團體的組織（五）勞資的爭議每節所論均各有獨到之處舉例尤爲她書所不易見到的</p>
<p>我們將此書讀完便能明白中國近代經發展史的整個意義在經濟落後的我國此書的問世實具有偉大的價值而决非什麽　　思經濟史可以互相比擬的由此更足見此書價值的一斑了</p>
<h3>世界農業狀况南心</h3>
<p>吳覺農編誰也可以朋白我國自有史以來就成一個從事於農業的國家是以人工生産人類間所必需的動物質與植物質的貨殖事業當然所謂農業不但祇限於農田的耕種但在事實上無論是任何時代對於培養植物質的生産事業以外大都更經營着飼養漁獵等等的動物的生産所以我們關於農業從狹義的說祇是培義植物而從廣義的說就是對於一切的裁培造林畜産水産等等事業都是屬於農業的生産範圍之内</p>
<p>旣然農業的對象都是住物生物的成長繁殖所受於自然條件的　　極　重大因爲這樣經營形態中不能不處處受到自然條件的支配雖然鑛業的採取無生物工業的加工製造商業的懋遷有無直接間接也不能不受自然條件的影響不過這些都没有農業的那樣顯著吧了這樣說來基本地來經營農業當然也不是什麽極形容易的事但是我們旣是以農業而立國那麽對於農業上種種的常識應該有以明瞭進一步說當然是要加以研究才好這是與中國富源的發展有極大的關係如果一個以農業建立的國家它的所屬國的農業産生品反不及以工業爲基本的國家來得發達這是多麽漸愧的事呢所以吳君這部（世界農業狀况）一書是值得我們加以注意的</p>
<p>研究農業當然要從農業上的幾個重要之點加以探求如氣候土地機械以及營得等等問題入　吳君此書也是注意到此等重要的問題在第一章的　論裹最先就是說明農業的特性農地的面積農作物的生産量與及農作物的國際贸易等作者對於中國方面所說尤爲</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>詳實因於世界各國則列表格以比較之如（世界各國的農地面積表）共同生産（包括小麥裸麥玉蜀黍馬鈴薯等等）面積作物裁培地别表）（各國禾榖類裁培面積表）（世界主要農作物生産額表）（世界及各大洲的重要農作物輪出量表）等這都是研究農業的重要的參考資料編者搜集極爲詳細爲它種此項書籍上所不易見到的然而這樣的比較研究可以使我們明白那一個國家的農産吕的優與劣更可以作我們自已國家的　鑑發奮地努力起關於此項的事業在被外來經濟侵略下的中國此種問題與整個的本國有所重大的關係這農業改進的責任一般學者是應該負起的</p>
<p>農民生活狀况的調查佃農制度的史實與土地改革的經過這些都是農業上最重要的問題即如農民是供給人類生活資料最重要的份子佃農制度的沿革是應該有以明白的土地則是人類生存的基礎尤爲經營農業的第一要素這毋須說是關於此項事業的重大之點道　節是編者在第二章（農政）裹所述及的</p>
<p>第三章是述（米榖）（栽培槪設（二）發展米榖的社會條件（三）米榖的生産國（四）生産狀况與需給關係我們要曉得米榖在世界的食糧品中它當然是占住極重要的位置所以此章所述更爲扼要編者關於此項資料搜集亦爲詳細將中國東三省的哈爾濱以南的地方所生産的米榖都加以檢討這委實是難能可貴的事第四章是述（麥類）（一）栽培槪說（二）麥類的生産國（三）生産與需給第五章是述（棉花）（一）栽培槪說（二）棉花的生産國（三）生産與需給第六章是述（蠶繭）（一）槪說（二）蠶業國（三）需要與供給第七章是述（茶）（一）槪說（二）茶葉生産國（三）茶的需給第八章是述（林業）（一）槪說（二）各大陸的林産（三）木材的消費與贸易第九章是述（畜産）（一）槪說（二）家畜的分布（三）家禽的分布與鷄卵貿易第十章是述）（水産）（一）槪說（二）生産與製造（三）需要與供給書末附有（世界耕地比較圖）一幅尤爲珍貴</p>
<p>本書祇要請看上列所述便能明白内容的豐富與詳盡的一斑了而且編者完全是抱着研究的態度怎樣的來發展本國的農業爲其唯一的目標决不是其它著述者含有其它作用的來探求此項問題的所以僅在一點上亦可窺見本書的偉大的價值來了還有一種我們引爲很痛心的就是一個以農業建立的國家對於農業上的問題一點也不加以深刻的研究即是此項書籍亦是寥落晨星簡直是很少看見的因爲這樣吳君此書是開了關於此項事業作基本研究的先導我們也就應該對於此書加以注意起來所以這書的推荐於讀者之前是含有極大的意義至少我自已以爲是這樣</p>

<h3>務本師三參觀黃渡鄉師附小雲</h3>
<p>我們務本高中師範科的三年級本學期中有一門小學實習的學程而這門學程的作業除在校内開辦平民學校一方給附近的平民一個讀書的機會同時我們在敎員的指導之下就實習我們敎授的方法此外我們也時常出外參觀各小學如什麽萬竹西成上中實小尙文差不多已經都有過我們的足跡了而他們校中的一切情形和設施也還留在我們的腦海裹以及筆記薄中我們深深的感謝有這許多事實的學問給我們觀模</p>
<p>但這都是都市中的小學槪况同學中有幾人似乎還不能感覺到滿足還想擴大參觀的範圍想去看看鄉村中的小學設施究竟是怎樣的於是乎就自動地要求學校允許我們到鄉村裹去參觀鄉村的小學要求的結果果然是成事實了决定去參觀上中鄉師附小五日的那天我們起了一個絶早這因爲上中鄉師的校址是在黃渡要乘滬寗路的火車去的因這路途的遙遠我們又决定要當天回來所以祇得起個大清早要趁頭班的火車出發在清晨六點半的時光我們這三十四位小姐都束裝齊備了和敎師鍾士傑姚枝碧二先生分乘</p>
<p>着八輛汽車在晨曦朦朧大風緊刮中我們的八輛汽車如迅風似的飛駛到北車站改搭火車直抵黃渡但到了黃渡而鄉師的校址距離車站據說還有六里多路好在我們都是穿好草鞋來的這自然是一種别開生面的裝束所以固然是雨後的泥路濘滑得步履爲艱但我們穿的是草鞋有的是毅力更有的是耐心終究被我們很快的走快的走到了鄉村師範部可是到小學部却還有三里路我們又鼓足勇氣繼續地前進終究又被我們走到了這是我們的目的地不過時間已快到十一時了以致我們祇能在這匆匆的一小時内參觀因這時間的侷促弄得我候都没有看個夾快殊爲憾事鄉師附小的設備大槪是很完備的吧這因我没有參觀過多少的鄉師附小所以我是不能亦不敢下一個肯定的斷語而他們的敎室即就是在圖書館裹用圖書館來做敎室可算該校能利用校舍且亦便於敎授這是很可採取的敎室中的布置整齊地版清潔光線也還充足便光是從方進來的則不免有些反光那時班中共有學童九個他們的衣服並不怎麽華麗但還清潔他們的精神活潑他們的身體行動的表示健全的美態實在要比都市中的兒童來得强健些他們的聲調的高爽且有剛强健全的音帶更是值得我們看得歡喜的而他們對於我們这一班人進去參觀也並不發生怎樣的異樣他們似科仍是很鎭靜地聽講且回答問題時也還如意自然這在我們是不得不欽佩該生等的受過良好的訓練但因時間的催促我們不能久留細觀我們祇好離開這裹向南面去參觀他們的幼稚園</p>
<p>幼稚園裹的設備很優美並多兒童的工藝成績而這些成績却又大都是合於兒童的心理的或可說都是些兒童日常生活中所玩弄的必需品如剪成的衣服及採集來的花草樹木等的標本不過有一點是值得我們注意的當我們去參觀的時候我們祇看到四個學生而這幾個兒童却没有都市裹的那樣活潑且有怕羞的表現在我們去看的時候敎師敎他們游戲但他們都是默然地無言也不動作弄得結果敎師也祇得放他們自由地去游玩了據說這幼稚園裹的兒童人數原來是不祇這幾個的這因日昨天雨的緣故所以在今天祇到五人在這一點上該校的小學部敎務主任和幼稚園的主任都說辦鄉村敎育最感到困難的即就是學生的缺席太多如雨天雨後農忙以及親族的婚嫁兒童就大多數的不能到校尤其是在雨天和雨後這眞是一件因難的事該校屢思補救的方法且實行過了一些如到兒童的家庭裹去談話請其應勿使兒童缺課應少使兒童工作應備雨具給兒童但成效仍是後科其微這或許最大的原因是在農村經濟的缺乏吧望謀普及敎育者有以注意及之共商補救的方法打破这種鄉村敎育最大的困難</p>
<p>草草率率地總算把小學部及幼稚園都看遍了這時已經是正午十二點鐘了我們就怱忙地由實小走回到鄉村師範部這因我們的午飯是備在師範部裹的師範部我們是没有資格參觀更没有學問來批評我們祇能請該校的師長們來給我們一些訓誨但是那位先生很客氣他要領我們去參觀各敎室等我們看到以後我們祇感覺到美滿他們的女生宿舍的清潔他們的成績室裹的成績優良這並不是我不自量的批評實在是一種快感的流露</p>
<p>後來又蒙該校同學們的一片熱忱厚意一定要開歡迎會歡迎我們我們却之再三我們覺得實在是不敢領受可是他們却又再三地要客氣弄得我們實在是却之不恭受之又覺有愧了但没有法子祇好在愧慚中領受下他們的盛情這自然是一個有意味的開會在這個會中我們聽到幾位先生的訓話我們又聽各位同學的謬獎和勗勉我們實在是感激同時我們也得到不少的智旘</p>
<p>迨暮色蒼茫天空呈佈出夜包的時候我們回到黄渡車站這是已經是六點鐘了但火車是誤時了還没有到我們就在車站裹大家手牽着手牽成一個大圈兒就把領導我們的姚鍾兩位先生圈在當中玩着各種的游戲說着有趣的笑話這時是寒風凛冽但我們却都陶醉於歡愉的玩笑中所覺到的祇是快樂本來我們回來的時候已經是遲了的中間又經了火車的誤時擔擱了我們一個多鐘頭所以弄得我們到校的時間差不多是初更時分了弄得校中剛巧在打睡鐘的時候而我們還祇是正在吃着晚餐這亦可算是一件有趣的事情　此外在這次參觀中可值得報告的還有該校的擴充事業一部份這是他們努力於（要謀學校敎育與家庭敎育的一貫）的宗旨所以要使學校的設施適應環境能進攻環境要學校事業向外發展使敎育的力量及於社會因之就非把學校和家庭以及社僵的盡量接近聨絡不可茲據報告該校近三年内對於這個問題的設施約有下列各種就把它寫了出來作爲本文記述的結束同時或許亦可給辦理鄉村敎育者的參考</p>
<p>（一）鄉村醫院這是兼診學生家屬及其他村民的槪不收費</p>
<p>（二）平時訪問校中的敎職員時常到學童的家裹去和他們的家屬談話談談課程的適於實用與否學生在家中作業的情形如何同時告訴他們關於校中的槪况以及將來的計劃并徵求他们的的意見間亦談到農事的各種問題及地方國家的新聞等項</p>
<p>（三）同樂大會的舉行在每年中開一兩次的同樂大會招待村民來共同娱樂使其對學校發生感情産生信仰心</p>
<p>（四）農民俱樂部在校中特開一室陳置各種通俗的書報及娱樂用具等供給村民的閱覽並指導其作正當的娱樂（五）其他如喜事的酬酢村事協助村政服務家長談話會懇親會母姊會等</p>

<h3>Resolution of Li's Troops in Xiaoxian</h3>
<p>Han Deqin entered the city to handle the aftermath. The 8th Army Independent Brigade of Li Yong'an, entrenched in Xiaocheng, was completely resolved by Han Deqin's division on the morning of the 28th. Li hesitated to leave the city after sending his family to the mouth of the river to be handed over to Han's troops as hostages at 2:00 PM on the 27th. That evening, Han ordered an increased encirclement and demanded that Li's troops turn in their weapons at the county government. Han's troops then entered the city on the morning of the 28th, and Li's unarmed soldiers gathered in the Duan Family Garden west of the city to await orders. Han went to the Xiaoxian government on the afternoon of the 28th to handle the aftermath together with County Magistrate Wang Gongyu. The people of Xiaocheng did not suffer any losses in this operation. During the conflict yesterday, Li's troops suffered dozens of casualties, while Han's division suffered only a few. Approximately 500 guns were confiscated. Li Yong'an is currently staying in the Xiaoxian government awaiting orders. Han gave a speech to the encircling soldiers outside the east gate of Xiao in the afternoon and decided to return to Xuzhou that evening. Order has been restored in Xiaocheng. The disposition of Li's unarmed soldiers, numbering over a thousand, is pending. (Special Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Han Deqin in Xuzhou completed the resolution of Li Yong'an's troops and returned to Xuzhou from Xiao on the evening of the 28th. Confiscated firearms were also transported to the division headquarters by car for safekeeping. Wang Gongyu is handling the aftermath in Xiao. A portion of Han's division will remain temporarily to defend Xiaocheng. (Special Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Conference on Abolishing Submarine Cable Contracts</h3>
<p>With a Trend Towards Rupture: The conference on the issue of abolishing submarine cable contracts with the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific companies in Nanjing has shown a trend towards rupture. The points of contention, apart from the issues of landing rights and the duration of the contract, which remain unresolved, are as follows: Regarding the issue of receiving and sending rights, the company representatives stated that each submarine cable telegraph office could display the signboard of the Chinese Telegraph Administration from January 1st next year, and the receiving and sending personnel could be recommended by the companies and appointed by China, with one director appointed by China at each telegraph office, with the rest recommended by the company and appointed by China. The Chinese side proposed conditions restricting their authority, which the company did not agree to. Regarding the issue of pricing, the company representatives stated that for communications between inland submarine cable telegraph offices and other inland telegraph offices or the Chinese Telegraph Administration, the fees could be shared with China, but the fees collected for communications between Shanghai and various countries should belong to the company. The Chinese side stated that regardless of whether communications were inland or foreign, the fees should be distributed equally, which the company did not agree to. Jiao Shiyi has made a final statement to the company representatives, stating that if they can accommodate the Chinese side's minimum requirements, they should reply by the 29th; otherwise, both parties will sever all contractual relationships by the end of this year. (Special Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications in Nanjing telegraphed the Northeast Communications Committee, stating that as the contracts for the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific submarine cables were about to expire, repeated negotiations had failed to resolve the issue. International telecommunications would inevitably rely solely on the Shanghai and Shenyang international radio stations to transmit messages. It is proposed to establish a direct landline connection between the two stations to facilitate the relay of messages to the Huaijin and Shenyang trunk lines. The main lines are not perfect and should be organized effectively to open direct service between Shanghai and Shenyang. In addition to ordering Zhao Zhensheng, chief of engineering for the Beining trunk line, to proceed from Tianjin to repair the line along the way, it is hoped that a commissioner will be assigned to proceed from Shenyang to meet and repair the line to expedite the process. (Special Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Hunan and Hubei Implement Abolition of Likin</h3>
<p>He Chengjun's Firm Expression: He Chengjun in Nanjing telegraphed Chiang, stating that likin is a corrupt policy left over from the Qing Dynasty and cannot be thoroughly eradicated to eliminate old habits and inspire new opportunities. The financial lifeline of Hubei Province originally depended on likin, but his duty is to obey orders, and no matter how difficult, he will instruct the treasury to abolish it on schedule to fulfill Your Excellency's intention to reform the tax system and restore the people's livelihood. The issue of compensation has been discussed in previous telegrams with Brother Ziwu. Respectfully replied. (Special Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>The Hunan Provincial Government in Changsha, in accordance with the central government's order to abolish likin, ordered all unified tax bureaus yesterday to complete their closure by the end of this month and report it for the record. (Special Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Zhang Fakui's Army</p>
<h3>Secret Plan to Enter Yunnan and Overthrow Long</h3>
<p>It is heard in Hong Kong that Zhang Fakui's army is now in Longzhou and Baise, joining forces with Tang Jiyu and Hu Ruoyu's old troops, planning to advance on Kunming to overthrow Long Yun. They plan to defeat the Yunnan army led by Lu Han, which has entered Guangxi, before entering Yunnan. (Special Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>The Eighth Route Army in Hong Kong has decided to accept surrenders from the Guangxi army, but continues to request that the central government thoroughly resolve the issue of Zhang Fakui. (28th)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Discusses Abolition of Likin</h3>
<p>The Tianjin authorities in Beiping have been studying the abolition of likin in the northern provinces for days. Taxes similar to likin in the eight provinces inside and outside the pass amount to 30 million per year, and their importance is almost no less than military demobilization. With only four days until the implementation date of New Year's Day, although there is no shortage of compensatory measures, the time is too short to catch up. A request for postponement is inevitable. (Special Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Dai Chuanxian's Letter</p>
<h3>To the Students of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Li Zaixing and three other student representatives from Sun Yat-sen University in Beijing came to Beijing to petition the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Dai Jitao. In addition to personally admonishing the representatives to persuade their fellow students to resume classes quickly, Dai also handed over a thick volume of his handwritten regular script in a square format to the entire student body for the representatives to take back and display in the school's library for public viewing. He also gave each representative a printed copy of the handbook. The representatives decided to leave Beijing for Guangdong within a day or two. The following is Dai's letter: Chuanxian cannot devote himself to the university's tasks due to his central government duties. The central government is mindful of the university and has specially appointed Vice President Zhu Jiahua as the new president, whose responsibility is now focused and his mind will be steadfast, and he will certainly uphold the doctrines of President Sun Yat-sen with diligence, caution, reverence, and sincerity to fulfill the mission of this university. Since accepting this appointment, Chuanxian has worked diligently day and night, hoping to successfully complete his term and hand it over to someone who can best bear the responsibility of president. Now that he has fortunately obtained his wish, his joy is beyond words. He will continue to devote his full strength to the construction of this university and assist his colleagues. Now, he would like to briefly state a few of his most fervent hopes as a congratulatory message: First, may all faculty, staff, and students of the university be of one heart and one mind, upholding the doctrines of the president with sincerity and trustworthiness, treating all fellow students with affection, being honest, diligent, and cautious in their duties, and being courageous and diligent in their studies. Second, all funds of the university must be used frugally, all undertakings must be solid, and all budgets must be achieved with the ideal of spending 50% and using 50% for equipment. Third, the construction of the new campus of the university is the fundamental work for all progress and development and must be carried out with the concerted efforts of the entire school. In particular, after the construction plan is decided, it must be trusted and everyone must cooperate. Many great projects in China have failed because they cannot trust the plans of experts. We must be very cautious and fully cooperative. Fourth, all famous and real universities in the world have fundamental talents who dedicate their lives to the university and do their best to cultivate their fundamental talents. A university without fundamental talents is like duckweed. Those with fundamental talents are as solid as mountains, as lush as pines and cypresses, and as vast as the ocean, lasting for thousands of generations without decline. From its founding to the present, the university has not been established for seven years, and the period for the formation of basic talents has not yet arrived. In the future, all departments should pay attention to this. If you work hard for ten years, the foundation of the university will gradually be established. Keep this in mind. Fifth, if the people's trust is not established, the people's physique is not strong, and the culture declines, this is a major cause. The university takes the Three Principles of the People exam, the Sinology exam, and the physical education exam as the necessary conditions for graduation of students in each department. This is the key to saving the country and the race and must not be regarded as a formality. At least the formulation of standards and the improvement of methods should be carefully considered by experts before they can be achieved. Sixth, the task of specialized education in Chinese universities is first to create specialized talents for the use of the country and society, and second, to create advanced learning for cultural independence. However, in the early stages of creation, our country lacks specialized scholars, so seeking talents from other countries is a last resort. It is necessary to hire foreign scholars in the necessary departments. Do not feel unfair because of different treatments. Seventh, the establishment of engineering is extremely important and cannot be delayed any longer. Eighth, affiliated middle schools and primary schools must be run seriously to provide experimental resources. Chinese universities must use the methods of primary and secondary school education and have the spirit of primary and secondary school education. Because family education is poor and the social environment is bad, and the primary and secondary school eras have not been nurtured by gentleness and have not been trained in personality, it is still necessary to supplement the deficiencies during the university period. I have repeatedly said this to education officials, but few people have a deep understanding of it. The bad school spirit and poor academic performance of universities in various places are mostly due to this. If the affiliated middle school and primary school of our school can be run seriously and the faculty and staff of the university can pay attention to observation at any time, I dare to believe that it will definitely promote the progress of the university invisibly. I hope that you will pay close attention to this. Ninth, the foundation of our school is not yet solid and the equipment is not yet perfect. At this time, the most important thing is that professors in each department should work hard to improve and enrich their own departments and assist in the construction of the entire university in a consistent manner. Sometimes, due to the lack of talent and manpower, we have to concentrate the university's strength on one point that is urgent. I hope that the professors can understand the university's policies and help each other. If we work hard for several years, we will be able to lay the foundation for the university. Therefore, when the new university building has not yet been completed, we should maintain the current system of departmentalization and not rush to establish colleges in accordance with the new university system, which would hinder the overall construction of the university. Tenth, the organization of the Together Virtue Society is an important matter for uniting the spirit and harmonizing the feelings of all colleagues in our school. I hope that the gentlemen will carry it out seriously and enrich the equipment. People of Europe and America are happy to live in community life and are good at high-level entertainment, so they can create ritual and music civilization and improve national welfare. The culture of our country is declining, rituals and music have been abandoned for a long time, the habit of community life and high-level entertainment are not emphasized, so individuals make progress and strive for spirit, but society lacks harmony and happiness, and the country and nation suffer from its disadvantages. We must work hard for this. Eleventh, after the Qing Party, the students of our school painfully changed and strived to change the bad habits of factionalism and clan disputes. The school spirit changed dramatically and the whole school was harmonious, which was the best among universities in the country. I deeply hope that all students will work harder to focus the work of the student union on the tempering of body and mind and the pursuit of academics, and to cultivate integrity and shape character in order to complete the noble and pure school spirit of our Sun Yat-sen University. Twelfth, last year Chuanxian initiated a donation from the faculty, staff, and students of the university to dedicate a memorial building to President Sun's Mausoleum. I hope that the president and the faculty, staff, and students will regard this matter as being as important as the construction of the new university building, and that this is the spiritual foundation for building the new school building. As long as the students have this enthusiasm, it will not be difficult to build a school building of two or three million yuan, and it will be easy to raise the construction cost of a new school building of 10 million yuan. The foundation of the cause of commemorating the president must be built on the spirit of respect for the president by each person. The above twelve matters are Chuanxian's contributions to the future of the school. I hope that my wise president, professors, staff, gentlemen, and all students will clearly understand and appreciate them, carefully consider them, and strive to implement them. Long live National Sun Yat-sen University! Long live the Three Principles of the People! Dai Chuanxian respectfully (Special Dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The US Department of Commerce's View on Sino-US Trade</h3>
<p>The US Department of Commerce has repeatedly announced its views on Sino-US trade recently, and has now published a report stating that significant progress in Sino-US trade is unlikely before spring. It also said that the impact of China's new tariff on Sino-US trade has not been paid much attention to by Americans. The US Department of Commerce's concern for Sino-US trade and its hope for special progress have become more urgent recently, and not without reason. Currently, the three countries competing for economic hegemony in the Far East are Britain, the United States, and Japan. Since the extreme development of production in the United States, the volume of trade with China has increased greatly. According to recent calculations, its total amount has exceeded that of Britain and is only second to Japan. It has already ranked second. After the European War, countries have been trying their best to revitalize industry, encourage manufacturing, and compete in exports to seize foreign markets. The fierce international capital war has reached its peak. The United States, with its strong financial resources and large-scale production, competes with Britain, Japan, and other countries in the Far East, and it is growing to the point of surpassing Britain and Asia, and its ambition has long been alarmed by competing countries. However, suddenly, the result of overproduction of exported goods led to this sharp decline in the economic world. Industrial countries are not thinking of finding a way to save the fundamental cause of the disease, but are still intent on expanding trade, desperately wanting to find sales channels in unsalable situations, as if the efforts made before were insufficient and they are now making more effort. Therefore, today's trend of international capital war is even more urgent than in the previous era of commercial prosperity. Moreover, today's competitors in Sino-US trade are not only the three countries of the United States, Britain, and Japan, but also Germany, Soviet Russia, and Canada, which are powerful latecomers. However, looking back at the internal affairs of various countries, they are all on the verge of being unable to maintain themselves due to economic poverty and increased unemployment. Is the matter of competing for trade sufficient to solve all difficulties? I doubt it very much.</p>

<p>Sun Dianying visited Zhang in Beiping yesterday and said that his troops had already been reduced twice. Together with Yue Xiangru's troops, they still have more than 30,000 troops. Please send a senior official to inspect and verify them before deciding on the downsizing. He also told a certain dignitary that it would be difficult to downsize more than 30,000 troops into a division, which would require eliminating two-thirds of them. He hoped that the deputy commander would allow them to be organized into an army. Currently, the post-war military affairs have been completely resolved except for Sun's troops. Only financial issues remain. Zhang talked with Chou Yantian, the director of the Shanxi Finance Department, for a long time yesterday. The two matters of Shanxi issuing public bonds and allocating additional funds for demobilization have been telegraphed to the central government for discussion but have not yet been replied to.

According to unofficial news, there are a total of two thousand bandits active in Cha-Laha Waddy, possessing many firearms and bullets. They are based in the deep forest, so they have been spared from being captured as a whole. It is heard that the number of bandit deaths is between one hundred and one hundred and fifty, but this statement has not been confirmed. As far as is currently known, a total of fifty bandits have been detained. The government is now adopting all possible methods to deal with this situation.

<p>The Proletariat Accounts for Four-Fifths of the National Population. Income of Those with University Education is Barely Enough to Live On.</p>
<p>The National People's Society telegraphed from Paris on the 27th. The Little Parisian reviewed the German economic situation, stating after describing unemployment and other obvious signs of decline that currently, four-fifths of the German people have no capital whatsoever, and even one million of those with university education can only earn an average of one hundred marks per month to live on. For Germany, it is better to return to the poverty of the Middle Ages and have the public support the destitute, otherwise, if this trend continues, only a few bankers and industrialists will be rich, and the rest will become proletarians. According to the newspaper's recent comments on Polish and German current events, there are several articles that have attracted the attention of political circles in France and other countries. This article is one of them.</p>
<p>French Bank Embezzlement Case</p>
<p>The National Rights Faction Plots to Implicate Briand</p>
<p>The National People's Society telegraphed from Paris on the 27th. Opponents of French Foreign Minister Briand from the National Rights faction are plotting to implicate Briand in the Austerlitz Bank embezzlement case so that they can catch him all at once. Today, the parliamentary investigation committee summoned Briand to question the reasons why the Foreign Ministry opposed the purchase of stock in Italian companies on the Paris Stock Exchange and shelved the letters without publishing them. However, non-National Rights parties believe that Briand can easily clear himself of these charges, and Briand has sent a letter to the committee stating that he agreed to the purchase of Italian company stock on the Stock Exchange because the Minister of Finance strongly urged him to agree.</p>

<p>Secretly Transported Through Shanghai Ten Years Ago</p>
<p>New York News: The New York Times published an article citing Mr. Clagett, the former American Consul in Harbin, as saying that the remains of former Russian Emperor Nicholas II and his family were transported from Womusk to Harbin on an American consular train in the winter of 1919, transferred to Shanghai, and then transferred to a seaport in Italy. They are now stored in the kiln of General Gauthier's family (Commander of the Siberian Czech Army after the war) near Paris. These ashes were secretly stored in a box by White Army Commander Kolchak and entrusted to the American Consul-General Harris in Womusk for transfer to General Howard, the president of the Chinese Eastern Railway in Harbin. Consul-General Harris did not know the contents of the box. It was only after arriving in Harbin that Howard's subordinates told him. (World)</p>
<p>It Is Difficult to Expect Progress in Sino-American Trade</p>
<p>Observations of the US Department of Commerce</p>
<p>Omaha Stock Exchange Suspends Trading</p>
<p>The American Alliance telegraphed from Washington on the 27th. According to the Department of Commerce's announcement today, it is difficult to expect significant progress in Sino-American trade before the spring. However, China's political and military situation has recently shown signs of gradual stability. Therefore, the impact on tax revenue due to the low price of silver and the abolition of likin duties should also be partially eliminated. Some observers say that the low price of silver and the abolition of likin duties will lead to an increase in unemployment in China. However, since the import tax rate has been increased, the central government's revenue can be slightly increased. As for the impact of China's new tariff on Sino-American trade, Americans are not very concerned about it now.</p>
<p>The American Alliance telegraphed from Omaha, Nebraska. The stock exchange here completely suspended securities trading today to clear accounts because of commercial depression and numerous unemployed people. Almost no one is interested in various securities. The exchange has recently only opened once a week, but now it is permanently closed. Omaha has more than 200,000 residents and is an important city for industry and agricultural products, as well as an important railway center.</p>

<p>Cause of Fire at Japanese Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>Likely Caused by Overheated Electric Heater</p>
<p>Many Important Documents Destroyed</p>
<p>The Telegraph Communication Society telegraphed from Tokyo on the 28th. The cause of the fire at the Ministry of Railways is still under investigation. According to general speculation, it is feared that the electric heater was not turned off when leaving the office, resulting in overheating and fire. It seems that quite a few valuable documents have been destroyed. Fortunately, the budget materials that the Bureau of Management documents were supposed to bring to the Parliament for explanation were not burned.</p>

<p>Public Telegrams</p>
<p>From Jilin: To all newspapers, we have carefully read the declaration and resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session. The grand plans and great strategies set out a clear framework, laying a permanent foundation for the party and advancing together on the path of governance. The virtuous voice spreads far and wide, and the whole world rejoices. We respectfully lead the masses to wholeheartedly support progress. We respectfully telegraph this with great respect. Please note.</p>
<p>Zhang Zuoxiang, Chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government, and all members respectfully kowtow.</p>
<p>From Kaifeng: To all newspapers, unfortunately, Henan has become a battlefield. Although unification has been completed, the people of Henan have not emerged from the water and fire. Fang recently returned to Bian from Beijing and personally witnessed the disastrous conditions in various places along the way. The abandoned ditches and ruined fortifications between Liang and Song are shocking to the eye. The broken stars and collapsed walls between Luoyang and Zhengzhou are covered with rubble. When inspecting the villages and towns, weeds fill the streets, and there are few pedestrians. Chickens and pigs are viewed on par with unicorns and phoenixes. Beans and millet are valued equally to pearls and jades. The old, weak, women, and children along the way are all emaciated and haggard, looking pale and miserable, and are on the verge of death. Moreover, heaven has no pity and there is also wind and snow. The intensity of the wind is especially unprecedented in the past seventy years. Within six or seven hundred miles around Kaifeng, trees were uprooted, stars were destroyed, and telephone poles were completely toppled in one day and night. The iron roads were frozen solid and impassable for five days. If they are completely repaired, it will take at least two months. The loss to the railway is enormous, and the damage to the people can be imagined. At this time, the remaining cold in this desolate area is oppressive, and the hunger pangs are piercing. If they do not become bandits, they will surely die in the ditches. We are all human beings, and it is unfortunate to be born at this time and wither like this. What is even stranger is that the violent wind wreaked havoc only in one area. There was no major damage in Hebei, Zhengxi, Songdong, Runan, etc. Could it be that the grievances and evil spirits offended the heavens and brought this wind? How can it be so coincidental? I hope that experts in astronomy will conduct research. Fang witnessed this and was heartbroken, unable to fully describe it. I humbly ask benevolent and righteous people to show compassion and sympathy, devise ways to provide relief, or appeal to all parties for help, donate generously from their pockets, or quickly allocate disaster relief grains and goods to be transported to Henan and distributed. Su Zhe was entrusted to rescue those in danger and raise the dead from the bones, so that the wailing crows all over the land may celebrate their rebirth in one out of ten thousand cases. Otherwise, if the will of heaven and the hearts of the people are not rescued, it will not only hurt the foundation of the country but also lose the sympathy of mankind. I wish that my countrymen would quickly plan for this. I humbly express what I have seen and pour out my tears. I respectfully telegraph this and humbly ask for your consideration.</p>
<p>Zhang Fang of the Henan Disaster Relief Association kowtows and asks for forgiveness.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Measures for Dealing with Garrison Troops in Shanxi and Suiyuan</h3>
<p>The Old Troops of Yan and Feng Implemented Reorganization</p>
<p>Political Issues Have Not Yet Been Discussed</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Zhang Xueliang telegraphed successively to the generals in Shanxi, including Xu Yongchang, Shang Zhen, Yang Shouyuan, Fu Zuoyi, Song Zheyuan, Sun Liangcheng, and Pang Bingxun, summoning them to Tianjin to discuss the aftermath of Shanxi and Suiyuan after returning to Tianjin from Beijing on the 6th of this month. However, because the number of troops under Yan and Feng is still large, it is estimated that the Shanxi army has ten armies, each with about 10,000 people, plus four cavalry divisions and eight artillery groups, totaling about 150,000 people. The Northwest Army has Sun Liangcheng's six divisions, about 30,000 people, and Sun Dianying's three divisions, also 30,000 people. Song Zheyuan and Pang Bingxun's troops each have 13,000 people, and Gao Guizi's troops have 6,000 to 7,000 people, totaling no less than 250,000 people. However, the income of Shanxi and Suiyuan provinces is only about 2 million yuan, which makes it impossible to supply so many troops. Therefore, repeated discussions to resolve the situation have been extremely difficult. After Deputy Commander Zhang interviewed each general separately to find out how many people there were and how much funding was needed each month, he compiled statistics and then discussed the entire matter. Last night (the 25th) at 12:00 midnight, Zhang again summoned the generals to a meeting at his private residence to make a final decision. It is heard that the content is that the troops of each unit have many old and weak and temporarily recruited soldiers as a result of this war, and the guns and equipment are not complete. It is necessary to eliminate them. It has been decided to reduce the Shanxi army to four armies, each with two divisions, each division with two brigades, and each brigade with four regiments, totaling 80,000 people, reducing about 70,000 people. It has also been decided that Shang Zhen, Xu Yongchang, Yang Aiyuan, and Chuan Zuoyi will be the army commanders. As for the Northwest Army, it is also planned to reduce it by 30,000 people and form an army divided into three divisions, with Song Zheyuan, Sun Liangcheng, and Pang Bingxun as division commanders, and Song Zheyuan concurrently serving as army commander. In the future, there will be only 100,000 regular troops. Although the financial resources of Shanxi and Suiyuan are currently insufficient to address the funding issue, after the reduction, only about 1 million yuan will be needed each month. At the same time, by reducing administrative expenses, it may not lead to a very difficult situation. Shi Yousan's troops have been dealt with separately. It is heard that the central government will allocate 600,000 yuan per month to maintain them. As for the defense areas of each army, Hebei Province will not allow guest troops to enter. The Shanxi army will be stationed in Shanxi North and Suiyuan, and the Northwest Army will be stationed in Shanxi South. Deputy Commander Zhang is planning to send a special commissioner to Shanxi for verification. As for political issues, after the military issues are resolved, there will be some changes in Shanxi and Suiyuan provinces. Currently, they have not been discussed. Also, Zhang Xueliang's return to Liaoning has not yet been determined. (25th)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province Will Implement the Third Phase of Bandit Suppression</h3>
<p>Jiang Appoints Lu Diping as Concurrent Director of the Nanchang Headquarters</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The bandit suppression plan in Jiangxi is divided into three phases. The first and second phases have already been completed. However, the commander-in-chief has ordered all armies to recover all counties occupied by bandits before January 15. Commander Lu is also urgently seeking to restore Xingguo, Yudu, Ningdu, Guangchang, Ruijin, and Shicheng, which are still under the trampling of the Communists. Therefore, after the recovery of Donggu, he immediately drafted a third phase of joint suppression plan to be submitted to Jiang for approval so that it can be implemented immediately. Currently, the 6th Army of the Left Route is passing through Gan Dongnanfeng and reaching Ruijin Ningdu. The 19th Army of the Right Route is crossing the Gan River from Taihe and reaching the west of Xingguo. The 9th Army is advancing to the north of Xingguo Ningdu. In addition, the Hao Mengling troops that recently arrived in the province, except for the 60th Brigade stationed in the provincial capital, are also advancing north from Zhangxin and joining forces with the Hunan Army to jointly suppress Xiushui Wuning. Kong Hechong and Li Shixing's shares, and Wang Jinyu's troops have already arrived in Pingxiang to suppress scattered bandits in Lianhua Wanzai Yuanzhou. Ruan Hu and other bandits are also besieging the Mopanshan bandit nests in Yihong. After the third phase of the general offensive, the bandits should be cleared up as scheduled. Chairman Jiang previously planned to appoint Xiong Shihui to preside over the Nanchang Headquarters, but Xiong was injured in a plane crash. According to a telegram from the Ji'an Headquarters on the 24th, Jiang has appointed Commander Lu as the concurrent director of the Nanchang Headquarters. The 6th, 9th, and 19th Armies are all under his command and dispatch, and he is responsible for all bandit suppression matters in Jiangxi. Also, the 3rd Aviation Team, led by Team Leader Liu Yizeng, has arrived in the province with two Kers aircraft and is awaiting orders in Nanchang. It is heard that Xie Bin's entire New 10th Division and Qian Dajun's troops will also enter Jiangxi from Hankou to assist in the suppression, but the date of departure has not been determined.

<h3>The Bandit Situation During Bandit Suppression in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>The Essence of Shangrao County Reduced to Nothing</p>
<p>Tens of Thousands Massacred in Lianhua and Yongxin Counties</p>
<p>Shangrao Ravaged Three Times, Nanchang Dispatch: Shangrao is the transportation, economic, cultural, and educational center of the seven counties of Guangxin in eastern Jiangxi Province and a vital route into Zhejiang Province. The provincial government was once located here in the sixteenth year of the Republic [1927], indicating its importance. However, this year, it was captured by bandits three times, and the essence of the entire county has been reduced to nothing. The tragic situation is as follows: (First Time) February 23rd of this year was the first day the city was captured by communist bandits. On that day, at dawn, communist bandits attacked, entering the city through the northwest gates with hundreds of rifles and thousands of spears. The local militia in Shangrao fought bravely but were unable to withstand the attack and received no reinforcements, resulting in the fall of the city. However, they retreated in the afternoon, burning down the county government and the courthouse, breaking open the jail and releasing prisoners, and killing over a hundred civilians. The southern pontoon bridge became overwhelmed with fleeing civilians, causing it to collapse and many to drown. In the弋横 (Yi Heng) bandit area, spanning hundreds of miles, the practices of communal wives and shared property were rampant. Fields and boundaries were destroyed, and deeds and registers were turned to ashes. The great calamity of Shangrao began from this point. (Second Time) July 25th of this year was the second day the city was captured by communist bandits. Despite repeated telegrams requesting troops, no reinforcements arrived. On that day, at dawn, communist bandits attacked, besieging the northwest gates with over a thousand rifles and over ten thousand spears. The Shangrao police force had only over two hundred rifles, and together with the militia from northern townships and Hengfeng, they numbered only over four hundred rifles. Unfortunately, the commander Su Rui's command was ineffective, and defense was weak, leading to the fall of the city. The communist bandits occupied the county seat for three days and nights, engaging in arson, murder, robbery, and plunder. In this battle, civilians were brutally massacred, and property losses amounted to over a million, a tragic situation unprecedented in history. (Third Time) December 9th of this year was the third day the city was captured by communist bandits. On that day, at dawn, with a drizzle falling, the reporter, lodging in Shuinan, was suddenly awakened from a dream by the loud sound of cannons. Putting on clothes and opening the door, they saw male and female civilians and children fleeing in a chaotic crowd, slipping and falling in the muddy roads, their cries of sorrow and misery reaching a dire state. The southeast gates of the city were already surrounded by bandits, and none of the people inside the city could escape. The police force stationed at the northwest gates engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits, turning the area into a battlefield. However, they were outnumbered and had insufficient ammunition. After about an hour of fighting, the Shangrao police force was surrounded and disarmed. The police chief, Yuan Zhennan, seeing that the situation was hopeless, took his own life with a pistol. Over forty policemen from Yushan stationed in Shangrao city were also disarmed. Over sixty policemen from Hengfeng stationed at Luogong Pavilion in Shangrao were also defeated and surrounded and disarmed. At that time, over a hundred soldiers threw themselves into the river and died, and over a hundred were tied up and killed. The city fell. After the bandits entered the city, they searched house by house, killing over four hundred men and women and kidnapping over five hundred. Dozens of students from the Sixth Middle School were also kidnapped. The secretary, Song Huanxu, sent by the provincial government and stationed at the Shangrao County government, was ordered by the province to control the militia of the seven counties under the former Guangxin Prefecture and engage in suppression work. He had been in Shangrao for over two months and was known for his loyalty, courage, and efforts. However, the local militia had few firearms and weak forces, and they were exhausted from both defense and fighting. Since last month, the main bandit force has been returning to its old lair and engaging in constant disruptions, making it increasingly difficult to defend. Repeated telegrams were sent to the provincial government and the Hankou headquarters requesting troop reinforcements, but all were ineffective. Therefore, this time, when a large bandit force with over a thousand rifles and over ten thousand spears attacked, the city fell. Secretary Song Huanxu was caught off guard and unable to escape, and was captured alive, likely to suffer a cruel fate. The local people lamented this. County government secretary Ling Mengbai, section chief Niu, and others were also captured and brutally murdered. In this battle, the self-defense forces of Shangrao, Yushan, Guangfeng, and Hengfeng counties were completely destroyed and difficult to restore, causing particularly severe damage. All major businesses were looted, with property losses estimated at several million. On the morning of the eleventh, the large bandit force retreated on its own, after three days of arson, murder, and plunder. The county government, the party headquarters, and the large mansions were all reduced to ashes. The two pontoon bridges outside the city were also burned down. After the bandits left, the scene was bleak. Dead bodies were lying everywhere in the Wumiao (Military Temple), the small training ground, and on the streets. The sight was unbearable. Severed heads and disemboweled bodies were everywhere. Hundreds of corpses floated up and down the Xin River. For several days after the bandits retreated, no one dared to bury the bodies on the shore or in the river. The stench of corpses was so strong it could be smelled for miles. Every day at sunset, the sky was gloomy, and the gods and ghosts seemed to be weeping. Occasionally, when venturing into the city, the weeping of women could be heard everywhere. The misery of losing loved ones and children was so great that hardly any family was spared. To this day, the army has not arrived, and the remaining bandits are still moving around the city openly. Communist slogans are plastered all over the streets, and no one cares. Yushan and Guangfeng are in imminent danger. (At the time of writing, it was heard that Yushan and Guangfeng had fallen, but confirmation is pending.) The Magistrate of Shangrao County, Yin Chou, disguised himself and escaped and is currently residing in Changshan, Zhejiang, and dares not return to the county.</p>
<p>Situation after the Recovery of Lianhua and Yongxin: Lianhua and Yongxin are located in remote western Jiangxi and have now been recovered by the 19th Route Army. However, the bandit situation and the condition of the people is dire. Recently, fellow villagers from Yongxin in the provincial capital sent a telegram stating that the county had been newly recovered, but the remaining bandits were still active everywhere. They specifically telegraphed General Commander Jiang and Director He, reporting on the bandit situation and requesting the dispatch of troops to maintain local security. The telegram read: (Hankou, General Commander Jiang, Director He, Ji’an Commander-in-Chief Lu, greetings. Just received a telegram from the police chief Jin Chenli of the district stating that this time, following the 19th Route Army, having arrived in Yongxin after passing through Jianning and Yongfeng Counties, the scenery everywhere is devastated, beyond description. It has been found that over ten thousand people have been killed by bandits in Lianhua and over three thousand in Yongxin. Now, as the main army passes through, the communist bandits, knowing that resistance is difficult, are holding meetings to force farmers to transport grain with them into the mountains. Those who dare to disobey will be killed. Seeing this situation, the undersigned requested Chief of Staff Guo to leave a detachment of troops to suppress the bandits and save the people. Chief of Staff Guo said that this situation must be reported to General Commander Jiang for verification so that it can be followed. Please, the gentlemen in the province, do everything possible to earnestly request the authorities to order the 19th Route Army to leave a detachment or order Wang Jinyu stationed in Pingxiang to quickly send a detachment to assist. Therefore, a special telegram is sent to earnestly request that assistance be telegraphed immediately to alleviate the people's suffering. Awaiting orders. Yongxin fellow villagers association ( ).

<h3>Overview of Railway Construction in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>57 Li of the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan Section of the Yuehan Railway Completed</p>
<p>Surveying of the Foshan-Zhongshan Railway Also Completed</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Guangdong Province is currently rapidly expanding the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section of the Yuehan Railway (i.e., directly reaching Zhuzhou in Hunan from Shaoguan in Guangdong). According to recent surveys, the latest project has already completed about 57 *li* of the roadbed. Construction began in May of this year, starting south from the Shaoguan Station and extending north, following the upstream of the Dongheba River in Shaoguan, turning northeast across the Zhen River, bypassing the northern foothills of Maozi Peak to the eastern bank of the Wu River, and traveling north along the eastern bank of the Wu River. The first station is located at Lishi, about 32 *li* from Shaoguan, and has already been completed. From Lishi, heading north, it has recently been built to the northern foothills of Guanyin Mountain at the junction of Lechang and Qujiang, totaling 110,000 feet from Shaoguan to this location. Passing through the coal mountains near Gaolian Village, this mountain must be crossed through a tunnel, which is 1,390 feet long. During the commercial management of the former Guangdong Railway, 800 feet of the roadbed at both ends of this tunnel had already been built. The remaining 500 feet are now being excavated using pneumatic drilling machines, and it is expected to be completed this month. In addition, the Nanxiong River Bridge is also a major project, with a length of 800 feet. The bridge piers have been completed, and the steel for the bridge deck has been ordered. In terms of manpower, it is divided into four units, each called a 'section'. The first section is divided into six smaller parts and adopts a mixed labor system. The second and third sections adopt a contract labor system. The fourth section near Beijing adopts a mixed labor system. The first section has over 600 workers, the second section has 1,600 workers, the third section has 1,300 workers, and the fourth section has over 300 workers, totaling 3,800 workers. Among them, people from Hunan account for 3,400, and people from Guangdong account for 400. The first section of the project has been mostly successful, and the number of workers is gradually decreasing. The second section still needs three months to complete. The number of workers in the third section has exceeded the quota and will be reduced. The fourth section is still in need of workers due to its recent commencement. The above is the situation of the northern expansion of the Guangdong Railway. Recently, the Ministry of Railways also plans to build a railway from Foshan to Zhongshan to facilitate land transportation between Zhongshan Port and Guangzhou. Officials have been dispatched to survey the route, and the general route has now been surveyed. The route is as follows: starting from Foshan, the main station is set up, passing through Zhasha, Shijiao, Xilin, Longzhou, Taoyong, Wenhai, Chencun, Bijiang, Taozhou, Xihai, Wuzhou, Dazhou, Jizhou, Daliang, Rongqi, Guizhou, Xiaolan, Xiangjiao, Shiqi, Haotou, Zhangjiabian, Dahuan, Lanbian, Nanlang, Yaikou, Xiazha, and Tangjia. The proposed station locations are: Shijiao, Longzhou, Wuzhou, Daliang, Rongqi, Xiaolan, Xiangjiao, Shiqi, Zhangjiabian, Dahuan, Nanlang, Yaikou, Xiazha, and Tangjia. The entire line is 71 English miles long. In addition, another branch line will be built from Xiaolan through Jiuzhouji Road to reach Guzhen to connect to the Jiangmen Ningyang Road. This branch line is 12,000 feet long. The total construction cost for the main and branch lines is 12 million yuan. In addition to the 6 million yuan allocated from the Boxer Indemnity by the Ministry of Railways, the remainder will be borne by the people of Guangdong. (December 23rd)</p>
<h3>Harsh New Regulations Promulgated in the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>To be Implemented from New Year's Day</p>
<p>Increasing Difficulties for Overseas Chinese Entering the Country</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: Many Chinese merchants do business in the 36 ports, including Batavia, in the Dutch East Indies. Since the British Singapore government issued new regulations restricting Chinese laborers from entering the country, many Chinese seeking a living abroad have turned to the Dutch East Indies. This winter, the colonial government of the Dutch East Indies, due to the decline in the price of rubber and tin and the sluggish business, has also promulgated a new regulation restricting overseas Chinese from entering the country. The regulation is set to be implemented from New Year's Day. Yesterday, a returnee from Batavia, Li Yuanliang, issued a public notice in Shantou to compatriots at home and abroad, reporting the contents of the new import regulations of the Dutch East Indies so that those going to the Dutch East Indies know what to prepare to avoid being turned back midway and becoming displaced. The new regulations are as follows: (1) Anyone traveling to the Dutch East Indies from China or from British Siam must present a passport issued by their national government and the resident consul of the country they are traveling from. They must also comply with the import regulations to avoid difficulties upon arrival. (2) Anyone in the education sector carrying a diploma must declare their position according to the original name on the diploma to match the actual situation, otherwise they will not be allowed to land. (3) Anyone wishing to work as a teacher or staff member must truthfully declare their profession and must not enter under the guise of commerce or industry. If found out, they will be deported, and both the guarantor and the freedom to leave the country will be revoked. (4) If anyone in commerce, industry, or education requests a friend or relative to guarantee their entry, they must declare the guarantor's store name, address, and name and know that they pay a head tax of 18 guilders or more to the local government each year to be approved. If there is any discrepancy, entry will be rejected. (5) Anyone who pays a head tax of 18 guilders or more to the government of the place of residence each year has the right to guarantee only one person to land in that year. If guaranteeing a second person, it must wait until the following year and only if the tax rate has increased can the second person be guaranteed again. However, the person being guaranteed must work at the guarantor's place of business, otherwise, it will be considered a violation of the import regulations and entry and residence will be rejected.

<h3>Qingdao Business Community Opposes Postponement of *Li* Tax Abolition</h3>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: The National Government has decreed that the *li* tax be abolished on January 1st of next year [1931] and has repeatedly telegraphed all provinces and cities not to postpone the abolition on any pretext. It is heard that the Shandong Finance Department, due to revenue concerns, intends to send officials to Beijing to request a postponement. The Qingdao business community was greatly alarmed upon hearing this news. Various trade associations have requested the General Chamber of Commerce to forward their request to the Finance Department that the tax collection agencies set up in the city be abolished on schedule in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's order. The General Chamber of Commerce has forwarded letters to the Qingdao Goods Unified Tax Bureau and the Jiaozhou Road Goods Tax Bureau to act accordingly. The original letter is as follows: (According to a joint submission from the Qingdao Cotton Industry, Foreign Goods Association, Shipping Association, Cotton Yarn Association, Sundries Iron Association, Transportation Association, and Coal Association, the General Chamber of Commerce forwarded a telegram from Finance Minister Xian to the associations, and the associations immediately informed their respective trades. Everyone felt extremely grateful for the alleviation of their suffering. However, it is heard that the Shandong Provincial Finance Authorities are not prepared for the abolition of the *li* tax and intend to submit another request for a postponement, which is causing suspicion among merchants. It is the unanimous intention of all merchants to abide by the Ministry's order and abolish the postponement permanently, which is absolutely unacceptable. If the rumors are true, it would not only be contrary to the facts but also a violation of the law, which is difficult to accept. It is reasonable to jointly request the General Chamber of Commerce to forward the request to the various tax bureaus to act in accordance with the Ministry's order to facilitate commerce, etc. In view of this, the situation is accordingly forwarded to your bureau for consideration.

<h3>Shandong Province Clearing Local Public Property</h3>
<p>Occupants of Public Property Greatly Alarmed, Jinan Dispatch: Shandong Province established the Shandong Local Public Property Clearance Office during Chen Tiaoyuan's tenure to clear public property in the province, causing a large portion of residents in Jinan to become uneasy. Many civilian houses in Jinan City (excluding the commercial port) belong to the public and have historically only paid land tax, known as "Defense Tax," which is lighter than ordinary taxes. Since the establishment of the Public Property Office, anyone who built houses on public property and previously held formal public property licenses must present their old licenses for verification and exchange for new licenses, paying a license fee of 50 cents. Those who have not paid the full price or have only paid a deposit and have a receipt but no license must apply for a new license. Failure to report will result in punishment according to regulations. For all public properties, whether licensed or unlicensed, records must be kept, and taxes must be increased and paid. Private land with documents but no taxes must also be reported immediately. In addition to increasing taxes and paying taxes, a fee of three yuan must be paid. This is the past work of the Local Public Property Office. Recently, it has been decided that all public properties, whether licensed or unlicensed, will be registered and then measured and valued by the Public Property Office. Those with a relationship to the property will be given priority to purchase it at the assessed price. If they do not purchase it, it will be put up for auction. It is heard that the valuation standard is based on the prosperity of the area where the property is located, ranging from 500 to over 1,000 yuan per *mu*. In theory, since it is public property, the government naturally has the right to deal with it. However, the occupants have lived there for many years, treating public property as private property. Increasing taxes for the wealthy is not a major problem, so many people are presenting their licenses for verification. Now, everyone is required to purchase at the assessed price, which has naturally caused panic, especially among poor residents. It is heard that this measure by the Public Property Office is based on someone's suggestion that this would generate an income of 4 million *mu* for the province. According to the information, Shandong's public property is most abundant in Jinan, Jining, and Yidu. The Public Property Office has also decided to start clearing them, but Jining is difficult to proceed with. Yidu has a lot of Manchu-owned property, which is easier to handle. The large training ground in Yidu has already been auctioned off for 20,000 yuan. The following are the Regulations for Clearing Public Property:</p>

<h3>Liaoning Province Decides to Issue 6% Bonds</h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The chambers of commerce and farmers' associations of ten disaster-stricken counties in western Liaoning, including Heishan, Xinmin, Zhangwu, Jin County, Xingcheng, Suizhong, Tai'an, Yixian, Jinxi, and Beizhen, are in a financial crisis, with 90% of businesses and farms bankrupt, leading to local decline and displacement of people. Twenty-one representatives from these counties have jointly organized a petition delegation to the provincial capital to visit various authorities and request the issuance of 20 million yuan in bonds for relief. The representatives have been appealing for many days, their voices hoarse, but because Deputy Commander Zhang is delayed in Tianjin and no one is in charge, they have not yet received a response. Recently, as there is no definite date for Zhang's return to the province, the representatives feel that waiting one more day in the province means one more day of burden for the businesses and farms in their respective counties. They have requested the President of the Liaoning-Ningbo General Chamber of Commerce, Jin Zhezhen, the President of the Education Association, Wang Huayi, and Ji Jinsheng to go to Tianjin to meet with Deputy Commander Zhang and petition him. On the afternoon of the 21st, Jin and others, together with Finance Director Zhang Zhenlu and the General Manager of the Official Bank, Lu Muting, who had previously gone to Tianjin, returned to Shenyang. On the evening of the 23rd, the representatives of the ten counties, in order to clarify the results of the petition to Tianjin, held a banquet at Minghu Spring in the city and welcomed back the three presidents. After everyone was seated, the representative from Heishan County delivered a speech, followed by Jin Zhezhen reporting on the petition process, briefly stating that before they arrived in Tianjin, Deputy Commander Zhang and Chairman Zang had already had concrete plans for relieving the businesses and farms in the province. At the same time, Director Zhang Hengruo (i.e., Zhang Zhenlu) and General Manager Lu Jiqing (i.e., Lu Muting) were also summoned to Tianjin for this issue. As a result of their visit, it was agreed to immediately prepare a fund of 20 million yuan and assign the Official Bank of the Three Eastern Provinces to issue cash to relieve the businesses and farms throughout the province. Deputy Commander Zhang's main concern is to effectively relieve the businesses and farms themselves and eliminate the control and exploitation of a few people. He also instructed the representatives to return to Shenyang as soon as possible to discuss detailed measures with the provincial authorities. As for the fundraising, 7 million yuan will be transferred from the unified cigarette tax revenue, 3 million yuan from the remaining savings of the Finance Department of the Northeast Political Affairs Committee, and another 5-6 million yuan will be allocated from the surplus funds of the Official Bank. Deputy Commander Zhang has agreed to allocate his personal assets to subsidize any shortfall. It is heard that the Provincial Government Chairman Zang Shiyi has scheduled a joint meeting of leaders of various agencies and relevant legal groups for 11 a.m. today to discuss detailed measures.

<h3>The Issue of Reforming the Eastern Railway Freight Rates to a Silver Standard</h3>
<p>Harbin Merchants Bitterly Resent the Fictitious Gold Ruble Standard and Petition the Ministry of Railways to Order a Change to a Silver Standard - Harbin Correspondence: Last year, during the defense against Russia, the market in northern Manchuria suffered</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>immense direct losses. It was hoped that this year would be peaceful and that things would gradually return to normal. Who knew that they would again be stirred by the gold tide, causing the foundations to become even more unstable? However, most merchants do not recognize this as a deep wound and profound pain. What is most hated and heartbreaking is the Eastern Railway's change in freight rate conversion, altering the method of converting fictitious gold rubles into Harbin dollars, with prices changing every ten days. The standard price of the fictitious gold ruble is determined according to the soaring price of gold. As a result, the freight cost for one item is now, in effect, more than 40% higher than last year. Merchants find the freight costs too high, so they do not purchase goods as enthusiastically as before. At the same time, northern Manchuria, which relies on European transport as a means of economic survival, cannot export its produce due to the high prices. The market situation has been sluggish until now, and the daily income of large businesses is barely enough to maintain their storefronts. The financial situation is extremely tight, almost unprecedented in the last ten years. The increase in Eastern Railway freight rates was initially approved by the Northeast Communications Committee. The authorities were unaware that the Eastern Railway was a joint Sino-Russian venture and that a larger income for the railway would mean a larger share of the profits for China. However, they did not know that economic principles do not allow for such things. Two months ago, Harbin merchants petitioned the Communications Committee to order the Eastern Railway to reduce freight rates. The Communications Committee, believing that the policy came from above and that they could not change it, only instructed the Chinese directors on the Eastern Railway board to negotiate. After several board meetings, although there was talk of a 20% reduction starting on January 1st of the coming year, they are still watching and waiting. Harbin merchants, being squeezed by the Eastern Railway's Russian economic blockade policy, had no choice but to hold a meeting the other day and decide to petition the Ministry of Railways and the Northeast Communications Committee to order the Eastern Railway to change to a silver standard system. Their petition stated: "The Eastern Railway's freight rates have always been based on the fictitious gold ruble, and its freight rates were set when gold prices were low before the European war, ranking first among the world's railways. After the end of the European war, gold prices gradually rose, but the Eastern Railway's freight rates did not change. To this day, the freight rates are, in effect, more than three times higher than before the European war. Furthermore, in order to protect its own interests, the Eastern Railway abolished the fixed exchange rate of 1.07 gold rubles to Harbin dollars on April 15th of this year and changed it to a floating exchange rate, changing the gold ruble to Harbin dollar exchange rate every ten days. As a result, the increase in freight rates is now almost double what it was before. Moreover, the Eastern Railway is located within Chinese territory, and its passenger and freight rates using the gold standard not only infringe upon our national sovereignty but also undermine our monetary system. In short, the Eastern Railway is still using the freight rate system from the era when gold prices were low before the European war. Although the amount of gold coin freight remains the same as before, the price of gold has soared, and in our country, which uses a silver standard, it has, in effect, increased several times, hindering the development of industry and the prosperity of the region more than anything else. It is requested that the Eastern Railway's gold standard system be abolished and that the freight rates be changed to a reasonable silver standard system, based on the current rules of state-owned railways in various countries, in order to develop the industry of northern Manchuria and maintain national sovereignty." The Harbin merchants have made a firm resolution regarding this appeal, and they will not stop until their goal is achieved. The business situation is already extremely bleak, and if the gold standard system for freight rates is not abolished, they will all perish together. (December 22nd)</p>
<h3>Northeast Soybean Cakes to Be Resold to Europe</h3>
<p>The Authorities Specially Permit Passage Through Russian Territory</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: The Northeast Special Region Administrative Chief Public Office recently received a petition from Qu Jian'an, Chairman of the Northeast Oil Mill Industry Association, stating: "I have secretly investigated that the soybean cakes produced by oil mills in various parts of the three northeastern provinces have had their oil extracted and cannot be used as food for people, only as feed for livestock and fertilizer for planting. They cannot be sold in our country and are sold entirely to the East and West Oceans. The Western countries are very far from us, and the sea voyage takes 50 days to reach them. The soybean cakes are steamed with steam during oil production and contain moisture. After this 50-day sea voyage, the air inside the ship's hold is not ventilated, and most of them become moldy. Therefore, they cannot be sold in the West and can only rely on Japan and the South Seas Islands as sales destinations. Japanese merchants know that our soybean cakes cannot be transported to the West, so they suppress the value, preventing our oil industry from prospering. The Northeast is an extremely rich region for the production of soy beans. The oil mills use our country's machinery and our country's labor to produce oil cakes and sell them to foreign countries in exchange for money to enrich our people's livelihood. This is truly a good plan. Today, because our soybean cakes cannot be transported to the West, their value is suppressed, causing the oil mills to calculate losses and be unable to operate. If no measures are taken to save them, and we sit and watch the oil mills stop operating, there will be a great impact on the labor force, railway transportation, and national tax revenue. If we want to break away from the control of Japanese merchants and still transport soybean cakes to Europe, the only way is to change from sea transport to land transport. Investigate that goods can be loaded onto trains on the Sino-Eastern Railway to Manchuria Station, then transferred to Russian trains into Russian territory, and then to St. Petersburg Grand Seaport to be transferred to ships to Germany, England, Holland, and Belgium, and other countries. It takes 14 days to reach the destination. The transportation time can be reduced by three-quarters compared to sea transport, and the land has wind and sun exposure, which is as different from the humid heat of the ship's hold as heaven and earth. Then the soybean cakes will naturally not become moldy. It is well known that the Harbin-Manchuria Station route prohibits the export of food, but soybean cakes cannot be used for human food and are known to all. Moreover, they are transported through Russia to Europe and are not sold in Russia. Furthermore, the loading of ships from Manchuria Station into Russian territory to St. Petersburg Grand Seaport to European countries is the same as loading ships from Wuzhan into Russian territory to Vladivostok and then to Europe. There is no difference whatsoever. Therefore, I am presumptuous in submitting this document and requesting your review, hoping that you will consider that the association's request to transport soybean cakes through Russian territory from Manchuria Station to European countries for sale is a direct way to maintain the real estate industry in the three northeastern provinces, and indirectly to maintain the market and maintain the people's livelihood and increase national tax revenue. The use of railway transportation is requested to be approved for the record and implemented. I am extremely grateful. Furthermore, the Grand Seaport of St. Petersburg freezes over at the end of December every year and does not thaw until early April of the following year, when ships can sail. The time until the port freezes over is only two months. If you show compassion, please issue instructions early so that the soybean cakes can be transported to Europe before the port freezes over. This would be a great kindness." The authorities believe that the northeastern provinces are the richest region for the production of soybeans, and oil mills are numerous. The output of soybean cakes is also large. However, there are very few uses in our country, and sales are stagnant. In order to benefit farmers and care for merchants, it is appropriate to find ways to promote and find other sales channels. The association's request is not without merit. Investigate that there has always been a shortage of grain in the eastern provinces. The original plan of Heilongjiang Province for the ban on transportation from Manchuria Station only refers to sorghum, flour, and wheat. Soybean cakes are not included. However, the transportation of large quantities of grain by another route is a new initiative and should be given attention. At a time when the Sino-Russian conference on trade issues has not yet been resolved, the association's request, although it involves transit, may have implications for trade and should be handled with care. The matter was immediately forwarded to the Northeast Political Committee for review and instructions. It was ordered that the Northeast-produced soybean cakes be allowed to be transported out of the country from Manchuria Station and transferred to Europe for sale, as requested by the Oil Mill Industry Association, in order to maintain business operations. In addition to instructing the Sino-Eastern Railway Supervision Office to investigate the transportation rules and report for approval, it should also be instructed to notify the Northeast Provincial Governments for verification and circulation. The Chief Public Office has instructed the association to comply and has sent notices to the Northeast Provincial Governments for verification and circulation. (December 20th)</p>
<h3>Vladivostok</h3>
<p>The Soviet Russian Seizure of the Bank of Korea - Harbin News on the Seizure of the Bank of Korea by Soviet Russia</p>
<p>Sudden Trend Toward Serious Tension in Japanese-Russian International Relations</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Soviet Russian seizure of the Japanese-owned Bank of Korea in Vladivostok has suddenly led to serious tension, raising concerns that it may lead to a dispute between Japan and Russia. According to a report in the Russian newspaper here, the incident unfolded as follows: At 2:00 PM on the 17th of this month, two representatives from the Finance Department of the Soviet Russian Far East Executive Committee, accompanied by eight members of the National Political Bureau, arrived at the Bank of Korea and announced that, in accordance with the orders of the highest authorities, the bank would be closed immediately. They ordered the bank's employees to leave and, under the watchful eyes of the bank's president, sealed the books, documents, and cash. Armed soldiers were stationed inside and outside, creating an unusually tense situation. Subsequently, a notice from the National Political Bureau was received, placing the bank's president and key personnel under house arrest, restricting their freedom of movement. On the evening of the 17th, the armed guards inside the building were withdrawn. At 12:00 PM on the 18th, the Soviet Russian authorities sent personnel to the bank to question the bank's president regarding the work after the bank was inspected. On the morning of the 19th, the Executive Committee ordered the Finance Department, together with representatives from the Bank of Korea, to form a special liquidation committee to carry out the liquidation of the bank within five days. They also decided to punish the bank with a fine of five million rubles for illegally purchasing Soviet currency and disrupting the financial order. Finally, the police outside the bank were gradually withdrawn, but the bank remained closed. Japanese merchants in Vladivostok, whose source of funding had been cut off due to the closure of the Bank of Korea, were unable to conduct business and were preparing to return to their home country. However, the Japanese government believes that the establishment of a branch of the Bank of Korea in Vladivostok was based on the 1923 Japanese-Russian Treaty and had been approved by the Soviet Russian authorities. The sudden forced closure will have a significant impact on Japanese-Russian economic relations and diplomatic relations. According to the Soviet Russian side, their current economic policy does not allow foreign banks to be established in Soviet Russian territory, and the Bank of Korea's business activities have exceeded the permitted scope, hence the seizure. The Japanese government has instructed Hirota, the Japanese ambassador to Russia, to lodge a strong protest with the Russian government, but the Russian side's attitude is extremely firm, and the outcome is difficult to predict.

<h3>Communist Bandits in Lu'an Have Been Repulsed</h3>
<p>Wei Lihuang's Troops Temporarily Postponing Westward Advance - Bengbu Correspondence: Communist bandits from Hubei and Henan, after being severely suppressed by various armies, fled to western Anhui. Since occupying Jinjiazhai, which belongs to Lu'an County, they took advantage of the situation to invade Lu'an and Huo Hill. The Lu'an guerrilla forces and defense groups, considering the overwhelming strength of the bandits, abandoned Emaoling and Mapu one after another and retreated to the county seat. The Lu'an County government repeatedly sent urgent appeals to the provincial capital and Bengbu, requesting the swift dispatch of troops to suppress them. The provincial government immediately telegraphed the 46th Division, Fan Xiji's unit, to launch a forceful suppression. Wei Lihuang, the commander in Bengbu, upon receiving the report, besides dispatching the 3rd Detachment, Song Shike's unit, to Zhengyangguan to set up defenses and intercept, also sent the 135th Brigade, the 268th Regiment, headed by Regiment Commander Long Qi, and the temporarily organized 1st Regiment, headed by Regiment Commander Xiao Wulang, to Lu'an to assist in the suppression. A telegram has recently been received from Lu'an stating that the siege of the city has been lifted and the communist bandits have collapsed westward. Wei has ordered the Long and Xiao regiments to temporarily postpone their westward advance and remain in Bengbu for training. (December 26th)</p>

The Ministry of Finance of the National Government has now issued a response stating, "Received the petition. This construction bond has been repeatedly telegraphed by the chambers of commerce of various cities and counties in Jiangsu Province to be forwarded to the Provincial Government for temporary issuance. The Provincial Government has already replied and has ordered the two departments of finance and construction to handle it properly." The Ministry has combined the urgent instructions, which are also acceptable. It is estimated that this construction bond will be officially issued.</p>

<p>Another Robbery Case by Zou Kaihua - Recently, robbery cases have been increasing in rural areas.

The home of Zhou Jinghua, a resident of Fangqiao Town in the 14th District (Kaihua Township) (currently the chief of Nanzhen Town), was suddenly broken into by seven or eight robbers with northern accents, holding handguns and flashlights, at about 1:00 AM last night. They climbed over the wall and immediately confined the men, women, old, and young of the Zhou family in one room. Then they went from room to room, overturning boxes and cabinets, searching and looting at will for about half an hour before escaping with their loot. The next day, the victim, Zhou Jinghua, checked the stolen items and found that the losses were relatively light, and he planned not to report it to the county and request an investigation. Preparations for Registering Businesses in Rural Townships - Zhuang Yeguang, Director of the County Finance Bureau, was ordered to prepare for the registration of businesses. He has already started work in accordance with the order. However, the various rural districts are far from the city, and it is difficult to obtain accurate information without sending personnel to conduct on-site investigations. Yesterday, he specially dispatched personnel to carry the application forms to various towns to work with the district chiefs and chiefs of public security sub-bureaus to conduct thorough investigations in accordance with the established rules and regulations, and to notify business owners to truthfully fill in the various items in the application forms and bring them to the bureau for registration, and to collect the registration fee of 2 jiao per form for remittance. At the same time, Director Zhuang also sent letters to the district offices and public security sub-bureaus to assist at any time.</p>
<p>Jin Cheng Township to Build a Road - Citizens He Jianhou and others from Yangming Township in the Third District (Yangming Township) stated that the Jin Cheng Township area in the district is densely populated and the traffic is very heavy. For the convenience of transportation, they plan to build a road starting from Jincheng Bay in the east to Zhouxin Town and from Changjiang Fen in the north to Yangming Bridge, directly reaching Daqiaonong. It is estimated that it will cost more than 400 yuan to build 600 zhang of earthwork, 8 chi wide and 1 chi thick, and 5 cun of coal slag. The funds have already been raised. If there is a shortfall, please ask the district office to provide a discretionary subsidy. Construction is scheduled to begin on the 31st of this month. The other day, He Jianhou and others sent a public letter to Zou Qingxiang, the district chief, requesting that it be forwarded to the county government for a protective announcement. District Chief Zou approved the letter and forwarded it to County Magistrate Pan yesterday for approval to put it on file and issue a notice to facilitate construction.</p>

<p>Party Headquarters in the Sixth District Opposes the Resolution of the Zhou Case - The Party Headquarters in the Sixth District held a full meeting of party members in Yuecheng Bridge on the 25th and resolved the following important cases: (1) Regarding the Provincial government's resolution of the Ju Shuiping case, it was deemed unsatisfactory. The main culprit, Sha Bingyuan, must be sentenced to death, and the accomplices should be punished according to the severity of their crimes. Half of their falsely seized property should be used for local education and industry to commemorate the event. Those who have been falsely accused and have indeed only affixed their names should be investigated and declared innocent, and lower-level party headquarters should be telegraphed to unanimously advocate this. (2) Party member Jiang Hong was imprisoned in the Wei Hehua case, and the facts of the crime are unclear. Although he has petitioned the High Court to transfer the case, it has been three months with no progress. Before the High Court transfers the case and determines the date of the hearing, the case should be submitted to the upper-level party headquarters and the county for temporary bail. (3) Jiang Qichen and Gu Hejin proposed that Xie Tingyuan and Tao Shenggao, party members in Rizhao Township in the district, have worked hard to eradicate the communists and have arrested and executed the bandit leader Chen Weiwu, and have been rewarded by the upper-level party headquarters. Ji Hehua, as a party member, dared to go to the township by flying bridge on the morning of the arrest of the criminal and devised ways to help Chen, and personally promised the villagers of Rizhao Township 1,000 yuan to release him or 500 yuan to exchange him for a solution to the case. The association should investigate the evidence and submit it to the upper-level party headquarters for strict handling, as per the case passed.</p>

<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>The Command Headquarters for Bandit Suppression in the Four Districts Continues to Exist: After Generalissimo Chiang issued an order entrusting the pacification commissioners or security departments of various provinces with bandit suppression matters, it was expected that the command headquarters for bandit suppression in the four districts of Ningbo would be abolished. However, it has been learned that the Zhejiang Provincial Government considers that the establishment of the Ningbo bandit suppression command headquarters predates other provincial command headquarters and that the situation is different. Therefore, it is not appropriate to abolish it immediately. The matter will be brought up for discussion at the next provincial government meeting to consider its continued existence.</p>
<p>The Ningbo Consolidated Tax Bureau is Ordered to Abolish: As the National Government implements the abolition of miscellaneous taxes similar to the likin tax, the Ningbo Consolidated Tax Bureau received an order from the Department of Finance yesterday afternoon to abolish immediately in order to comply with the policy of tax abolition.

They broke open the wardrobe and stole soft clothing and more than one hundred yuan in cash, totaling more than three hundred yuan in losses.</p>
<h3>Bengbu</h3>
<p>Abolition of the Salt Affairs Anti-Smuggling Bureau: The Ministry of Finance considers that the Salt Affairs Anti-Smuggling Bureaus in various provinces oversee anti-smuggling matters and have similar authority to the anti-smuggling teams, making them redundant organizations. Therefore, it has ordered the abolition of the Anhui North, Huai North, Jiujiang West Bank, Hubei Bank, and Hunan Bank bureaus. Yu Daonan, the director of the Anhui North Salt Affairs Anti-Smuggling Bureau, upon receiving the order, immediately instructed the departments within the bureau to complete the closure procedures. The anti-smuggling teams stationed in various counties will be disarmed locally and given severance pay to return to their hometowns. All confiscated firearms will be submitted to the Nanjing Salt Affairs Anti-Smuggling Office. The bureau is deeply concerned that the discharged soldiers may linger in Bengbu or other counties in Anhui North, causing trouble. It has informed the governments of various counties and the Bengbu Public Security Bureau that if any such soldiers are encountered, they should be allowed to pass or escorted back to their hometowns. The anti-smuggling duties in the counties of Anhui North will be carried out by anti-smuggling brigades dispatched by the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<h3>Promotion of the National Calendar Lecture Meeting</h3>
<p>Lectures Began Yesterday: Mr. Cai Yuanpei was invited to lecture yesterday, stating that the National Calendar is far superior to the Lunar Calendar, and all sectors should earnestly implement it. Today at 10 a.m., Mr. Chu Minyi is invited to lecture. Yesterday was the first day of the National Calendar New Year Celebration Preparatory Committee in Shanghai to hold a lecture meeting to promote the National Calendar. The Preparatory Committee specially invited Mr. Cai Yuanpei to the third floor of the Municipal Party Department to lecture on the issue of promoting the National Calendar. More than 300 people attended the lecture. Yang Qingyuan, the Minister of Propaganda of the Municipal Party Department, presided over the meeting and reported the significance of the lecture meeting and introduced Mr. Cai. After the report, Mr. Cai was invited to give a speech, which was extremely sincere and moving. The lecture meeting will continue at 10 a.m. today. Mr. Chu Minyi has been invited to lecture. All sectors can send representatives to attend the lecture.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai Yuanpei's Speech: Excerpts from Mr. Cai's speech are as follows: "Chairman and Comrades, everyone present today is enthusiastic about promoting the National Calendar and has a deep understanding of it. Today, I would like to simply make a discussion. The problem we are discussing today is how to promote the National Calendar, or in other words, what methods to use to promote the National Calendar. I think the first thing to pay attention to in promoting the National Calendar is to make the people sincerely and willingly follow the National Calendar. In fact, it is now somewhat compulsory, but when we go out to promote and lecture, we should make people sincerely and willingly believe in it. Before, it was not called the National Calendar but the Imperial Calendar. Its calendar was changed according to the dynasty. When a person became emperor, he would change the clothes, etiquette, and political laws of the previous dynasty, and the calendar would also be changed. At that time, China's calendar only had a lunar calendar, which was based on the moon. Later, because it did not match the facts, a leap month was added. This reform was not easy to invent in the past. However, in terms of vertical organization, everyone believed that the lunar calendar was very complete and there was no need to doubt it. So, what method was used to change it when the dynasty changed? The Xia Dynasty established Yin, that is, the first month of the lunar calendar, as the beginning of the year. The Shang Dynasty used November as the beginning of the year. The Zhou Dynasty used December as the beginning of the year. By the time of the Qin Dynasty, they admired the new laws. At that time, general scholars or Yin-Yang families advocated the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, that is, the so-called metal restrains wood, fire restrains metal, and so on. After the Han Dynasty, they believed in the doctrines of Confucius, so this trend gradually disappeared. When Lu Buwei wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals, he determined that Jian Yin was the orthodox, and one season was divided into three times, Meng, Zhong, and Ji, with spring as the beginning of the year. This method remained the same until the Qing Dynasty. After the establishment of the Republic of China, Premier Sun Yat-sen advocated the use of the solar calendar. His intention was not to change the calendar like the ancient dynasties, but to discover that the lunar calendar had many disadvantages and the solar calendar had many advantages. Of course, the solar calendar is not perfect. For example, now there are many people studying that four weeks are one month, thirteen months are one year, and one year has five days for commemorative days. This is called the Universal Calendar. This method is very convenient because it is not as troublesome and difficult to remember as the solar calendar with twenty-eight days. However, this method has not yet reached the stage of application and is still a matter of research and should be put aside for the time being. The reason why Premier Sun Yat-sen wanted to adopt the solar calendar during the early years of the Republic of China was to suit the economic system such as budgets. His purpose was entirely for the benefit of the people and did not contain the meaning of the imperial calendar. This is the first point we should understand. Some people doubt that applying the solar calendar is following fashion. For example, many people in Shanghai speak with a few words of English and like to wear Western clothes (this point needs to be stated). Western clothes are more convenient than Chinese clothes. The reason why I personally do not wear Western clothes is because there are few woolen products among Chinese goods). They also think that we advocate the National Calendar is following fashion. In fact, this is a big mistake. We must know that the solar calendar is completely based on astronomy and rational research and is the most reasonable method, not blindly learning from foreigners. This is the second point we should pay attention to. At the same time, we should also understand that we Chinese have actually been using the solar calendar for a long time. For example, the twenty-four solar terms of the year, such as the vernal equinox, are completely applied to the principles of the solar calendar. Farmers do not know on which day of which month to sow, weed, or harvest. They completely rely on the solar terms to calculate. In terms of solar terms, the solar terms and the lunar calendar months often differ by several days or even a month. The solar calendar does not have this drawback. Therefore, China has always followed the lunar calendar, but in fact, the application of solar terms has already combined the lunar and solar calendars. Therefore, our use of the solar calendar now is not learning from foreigners, but choosing the most reasonable and scientific calendar from the various calendars in the world for convenience and accuracy in application, not blindly following, but choosing from ourselves. This is the third point we should understand. However, when we strive to follow the National Calendar, our enthusiastic propaganda comrades should pay attention to a few points. First, there is a difference in lifestyle between rural and urban areas. In cities, factories and institutions can take weekly rests, but this is not the case in rural areas. During the busy farming season, not to mention eight hours or ten hours a day, even fourteen hours is not considered strange. When there is nothing to do, it is not surprising to be idle all day. When sowing and adding fertilizer, farmers have no money and even pawn their clothes and pledge their goods for high-interest loans, which can only be repaid and redeemed after the harvest. At this time, the money from the rural areas enters the small money shops from the farmers, and then the large money shops and finally the banks. Then, everyone who owes money can file a complaint and have it all settled. Therefore, the chambers of commerce in various places have requested the central government to postpone the accounting period to February 15. The reason why the central government allowed this is precisely this. However, the year-end accounting should be followed according to the National Calendar. To go one step further, the accounting date can be stipulated at any time. For example, it is not surprising to set accounting dates for term debts, as well as the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Dragon Boat Festival. As far as schools are concerned, promoting the National Calendar is even less of a hindrance. It's just that the date for students to go home to visit relatives is earlier. There is even less inconvenience for those who work in institutions. As for the farmers, they only have leisure in February of the National Calendar. At this time, they can rest, and the government will of course allow their freedom and will never interfere. There is even less of a problem with the early worship of ancestors. According to the facts, the solar calendar is much better than the lunar calendar. For example, the lunar calendar has a leap month and a year has thirteen months. In schools, the compilation of textbooks and the hours of teaching by teachers become a problem. In the industrial and commercial sectors, salaries and wages must also be paid for an extra month. Moreover, after following the National Calendar, feudal forces and superstitious habits can also be gradually abolished, just like the fact that the capital is in Nanjing and not in Beijing. Although this cannot be achieved overnight, it can be achieved after years of accumulation. The government agencies that follow the National Calendar will gradually popularize it among the people. After the major banks follow it, they can slowly make the small money shops in the cities and the interior follow it. Other things like promoting and celebrating the National Calendar New Year can help promote the National Calendar. Shanghai and Nanjing have now organized preparatory committees to specialize in this matter, which is even better. I saw in the newspaper today that Shanghai has movie screenings and amusement parks open on New Year's Day, which are very good ways to entertain in the New Year. The government's laws and regulations are strictly enforced, and the party is the soul of politics. At the same time, party members are like the loving mothers of the people and should, of course, use a loving attitude to make the general public follow. In short, one of the most important points in promoting the National Calendar is to explain the benefits of the National Calendar and make the people feel the shortcomings of the lunar calendar, so that there will be no problem in promoting the National Calendar. As for the propaganda skills, everyone is very clear and I won't say much. I hope everyone will use the best efforts to promote and follow the National Calendar. That's all.

<h3>New Year's Day (Gregorian Calendar)</h3>
<p>Request to Permit the Burning of Firecrackers: Letter from the Fireworks Trade Association to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. Shanghai, as a major commercial port with a mixed Chinese and foreign population, requires the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to exercise caution in its defense. The temporary ban on setting off firecrackers has had a significant impact on fireworks merchants. Now that the Yan-Feng War has ended and the country is unified, the fireworks industry's only hope lies in taking advantage of the upcoming New Year's Day to boost business and make up for losses. The newspaper reported on the 21st of this month that the ban on setting off firecrackers would remain in effect during the New Year. Upon seeing this, all fireworks merchants were greatly alarmed. The Shanghai Fireworks Trade Association sent a letter to the Municipal Police Bureau requesting an exemption from the ban. The original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted: We were deeply shocked to read in the 20th of this month's newspaper that your bureau has issued a notice to its subordinates stating that the ban on setting off firecrackers will remain in effect during the New Year. Fireworks are a unique handmade product of our country. Their purpose is to improve poor air quality and ward off harmful influences and diseases. They invigorate people's spirits and enhance enjoyment. Not only are they popular among the Chinese people, but they are also welcomed by countries as far away as Japan, Europe, and America. Therefore, they have not been eliminated by scientific advancements. At a time when promoting domestic goods is being advocated, the government should make every effort to promote them so that they can become popular worldwide. Why should they be prohibited at all times and destroyed? If it is feared that they may cause fires, then in the bustling district of Shanghai, where people live in close proximity, the risk of fire is almost a daily occurrence. How many fires are caused by setting off firecrackers? If it is feared that they may cause misunderstandings during wartime, then a temporary ban was a measure of expediency. Now that Yan and Feng have been defeated and the counter-revolution has subsided, the country will soon see peace and prosperity. Chairman Chiang, in his telegram proposing a New Year's amnesty, stated that he did not wish to treat the country as a land of chaos. Should Shanghai be the only place to be regarded as a chaotic city and permanently adopt this wartime measure? If it is argued that they waste money, then Shanghai is home to numerous merchants. Apart from grain and cloth, which are daily necessities, there are countless other items that waste money and whose benefits are less than those of firecrackers, and many of them are imported goods. Why have we not seen any investigations or bans? The National Government has issued a notice stating that all kinds of entertainment during the Lunar New Year can be moved to the Gregorian calendar. There is no restriction on firecrackers. Even national criminals are granted amnesty on New Year's Day. What have our fireworks merchants done to offend the Shanghai Municipal Authorities? In the past, they have been banned under the pretext of martial law. Now, during the New Year's Day, when the whole country is celebrating, they cannot even have an opportunity to operate. If all public security authorities in the country were like Shanghai, then we, the millions of workers and merchants who rely on firecrackers for a living, would not know where to die. We hope that Your Excellency, the Director-General, will put yourself in our shoes and consider our industry. What would your feelings be? In short, if only banning firecrackers will prevent fires, prevent the counter-revolution from lurking, prevent the waste of money, and ensure that every move of the citizens is beneficial and harmless, then our industry would be willing to have its capital confiscated, its personnel unemployed, and starve to death, sacrificing ourselves to save others. If not, then the livelihood of our industry depends on it. We hope that Your Excellency, the Director-General, will take this into consideration and issue a notice to your subordinates that they must not interfere with citizens setting off firecrackers during the New Year's Day, so as to comply with public opinion and maintain commerce. We await your response with utmost anticipation. Addressed to: Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, Yuan. 19th year, 12th month, 28th day.</p>
<h3>Shao Lizi Denies Rumors of Going Abroad</h3>

<h3>Lu Shi Di's Funeral Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>The National Government Sent Zhang Qun and Yang Hu to Pay Respects. The funeral for General Lu Xiqing was held at 1:00 PM on the 28th. In addition to the memorial service held by the Lu family, the National Government sent special funeral commissioners Zhang Qun and Yang Hu, as well as hundreds of Lu's close friends, to attend the memorial service in person.</p>
<p>The text of the public memorial address is recorded below: On the 28th day of the 12th month of the 19th year of the Republic of China, Zhang Qun, Yang Hu, and colleagues respectfully offer this libation of clear wine to the spirit of Lu Gong Xiqing, saying: Alas, Xiqing has passed away. Is life a dream? What grief is there? Free from earthly toil, returning to the great awakening, a coffin upon the body, all things silent. Alas, how sorrowful! You flourished. Mr. Lu Xiqing, an image of youth. In Qing She Village, there was revolution. You held the axe. Leading the uprising in Kui and Wu, friendship in Chengdu and Chongqing, persuading and resolving disputes year after year. Your aspirations were sharp and dauntless. Suddenly, the heavy clouds obscured the sun. The path of the virtuous disappeared. The wise retreated, taking a raft and escaping far away to Japan. Respectfully serving the great philosophers, your spirit soared. Committing yourself and risking your life, the philosophers were overthrown. In the Guandian area of Yunnan, you raised troops and killed the rebels. Your wisdom encompassed the masses, and your knowledge surpassed the crowd. You were capable in both civil and military affairs, able to yield and to stretch. When rebellion arose on the coast and Sun Yat-sen was in distress, you devised a brilliant plan. On the banks of the Pearl River, the generals followed like the wind. The chief culprit lost his courage. Your achievements rivaled those of the new Zhou Dynasty, and your contributions rivaled those of the micro-governments. Guangzhou was stabilized, and the party's plans were further expanded. You led an army, and there was no conscription. When Sun Yat-sen went north, you followed him, traveling around Yan and Luo, and the public's hopes were placed on you. Alas, Heaven was unkind, and Sun Yat-sen passed away. Our party, in all its glory, inherited his legacy, settled the Jianghuai region, and pacified Hebei. Our military might was displayed, and the new capital was built. Your loyalty was admired by the court and the public. Driving and rushing about, consulting and divining, the grand plan was discussed and secretly presented. Your illness did not improve, and your great aspirations were not realized. Alas, how sorrowful! How can we repay your virtue? The box contains honors and fame. How can we not remember your distant and remarkable achievements in history? Relatives and friends grieve and wail, and the spirit banner is sorrowful. Where does the soul go? The libation cup is set in vain. Alas, how sorrowful! Accept our offering.</p>
<p>Funeral Meeting: The funeral committee for General Lu held its first meeting at 2:00 PM on the 28th of this month at 304 Rue Cardinal Mercier. Attendees included Central Committee member Shao Lizi, special funeral commissioners Zhang Qun and Yang Hu, and 35 others. Zhang Qun, as chairman, reported on the situation after General Lu's death, the discussions among comrades in Shanghai, and the progress of the funeral committee's preparatory meeting. Then, the discussion of future proceedings began.

The office</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>will be divided into four departments: general affairs, documentation, finance, and public relations. Each department will have a director and a deputy director.</p>
<p>A Brief Biography of Lu: A prominent figure in the Kuomintang, a member of the Military Advisory Council, a member of the Sichuan Provincial Government, a member of the Sichuan Provincial Party Affairs Guidance Committee, and the former commander of the Third Army directly under the Central Government, Lu Shi Di, also known as Xiqing, passed away due to illness at his residence in Shanghai on the 23rd of this month. He was born on the 4th day of the 12th month of the Bingxu year of the Guangxu reign in the late Qing Dynasty, making him 45 years old. Lu was from Chengdu, Sichuan (originally from Nankang, Jiangxi). He studied at the Sichuan Higher School and joined the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance), dedicating himself to the revolution for over 20 years. His contributions to the party and the country are worthy of mention. During the Xinhai Revolution, Lu was entrusted by the Tongmenghui to go to Sichuan to make connections. After passing through Kuiwan, he connected with the local defense forces and declared independence in Chongqing and Chengdu. Subsequently, the governments of Chengdu and Chongqing stood side by side. Lu, along with Xie Huisheng, Yang Shukan, Zhu Shuchi, Cao Shushi, and other comrades, worked hard to mediate and merge the two governments of Chengdu and Chongqing. At that time, Xiong Kewu organized the Sichuan Army in Yibin. Lu led his troops to join Xiong's command, and Xiong was promoted to commander of the Fifth Division of the Sichuan Army. Lu became the commander of the regimental troops. This was to lay the foundation for the Sichuan People's Army. After the failure of the Second Revolution in Guichou year, Lu fled overseas and followed Sun Yat-sen into the Chinese Revolutionary Party. Since then, he participated in military affairs and was involved in every battle. When Yuan Shikai betrayed the country, Lu returned to Shanghai and secretly plotted a campaign to punish Yuan with Chen Qimei and other prominent figures. Sun Yat-sen appointed Lu and Lü Chao to oversee military affairs in Sichuan. Lu returned to Sichuan and arrived in Xufu, where Lü Chao had already gathered his old troops to launch an uprising in southern Sichuan. They then agreed to promote Xiong Kewu as the commander-in-chief of military affairs. Lu went to Chengdu to persuade Chen Huan to declare independence. Lu served as the commander of the Fourth Division, assisting in the campaign to punish Yuan. As a result, the military strength of the southwest greatly increased, and Yuan's rebellious forces were defeated. During the campaign to protect the provisional constitution, Sun Yat-sen led members of parliament south. Lu returned to Sichuan and, together with Shi Qingyang, Lü Chao, Yuan Zuming, and other comrades, collaborated with the armies of Yunnan and Guizhou to drive out Wu Guangxin and support Xiong Kewu as commander-in-chief of the Sichuan Army. At that time, Sun Yat-sen believed that Wuhan was at the center of the world and advocated that the southwestern provinces join forces in Wuhan. He appointed Lu as the commander-in-chief of the First Route Army of the Sichuan Army to aid Hubei, stationed in Wanxian, advancing to Kuimen, awaiting the successive advance of friendly forces. The following year, Sun Yat-sen believed that the obstacles in Guangdong and Guangxi made it difficult to carry out the grand plan. As Yizhou was known as the land of abundance since ancient times, with abundant resources and a strategically important location, and relying on Lu as the "Great Wall", he changed his strategy and decided to lead the National Assembly into Sichuan, relocate the government to Chongqing, and go east to Wuhan to gradually establish the Central Plains. He then sent Chief of Staff Li Xiehe to lead the army to Chongqing, working exclusively with Lu to plan the westward migration. With Zhou's comprehensive and detailed plan, Lu once again contacted the Sichuan generals and gathered them in northern Sichuan, first pacifying the entire Sichuan and then respectfully welcoming Sun Yat-sen to establish the foundation of the party. This happened in the ninth year of the Republic of China. Not long after, Sun Yat-sen summoned him to Guangdong to assist him with the General Commander Chiang Kai-shek. When Chen Jiongming rebelled and Sun Yat-sen was in distress, Lu went to Shanghai to secretly plan with Sun Yat-sen and utilize the Yunnan Army in Guangxi. Sun Yat-sen knew that Lu had good relationships with the Yunnan generals when he was in Sichuan, so he gave Lu full authority to act as he saw fit. Lu, along with Zou Lu and Deng Taizhong, went to explain the situation, detailing the advantages and disadvantages. All the Yunnan generals were happy to serve Sun Yat-sen, and Lu then granted Yang Ximin the title of commander-in-chief of the Yunnan Army to assist the Guangxi Army in retaking Guangzhou. After the Yunnan and Guangxi armies entered the province, they decided to welcome Sun Yat-sen, but Guangxi Army Commander Shen Hongying and others disagreed and wanted to welcome Cen Chunxuan. There was a conference on river defense, and Lu debated on the spot. After the conference, he tried his best to mediate, and the Guangxi Army, knowing that it could not win, withdrew from Guangzhou. Sun Yat-sen was able to enter Guangdong again, and the foundation of the party and the country was roughly established. Later, Lu served as the commander of the Third Army directly under the Central Government and fought many battles to attack the rebel Chen Jiongming. In the fifteenth year, when Sun Yat-sen went north, he ordered Lu to accompany him. Regarding military plans, Lu took sole responsibility. He went to Henan on Sun Yat-sen's orders to consult with Hu Jingyi and other comrades on military affairs to consolidate the revolutionary base in the north and prepare for the Northern Expedition. In the sixteenth year, the revolutionary army retook Wuhan. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek sent Lu to Sichuan to contact and persuade Yang Sen, Liu Xiang, Deng Xihou, and others to submit to the central government one after another. There was no concern about the west, and the Northern Expedition was able to proceed rapidly. Lu was open-minded and generous, and his comrades were happy to associate with him. When Lu was in Chongqing, the left and right factions of the Kuomintang each set up party headquarters and criticized each other. Lu made every effort to mediate. Lu's health was weak, and he had been overworked and ill. He did not forget national affairs, even in his illness. He would ask Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek for advice and suggestions, writing thousands of words by hand. A carbuncle developed on his back, and its condition was very severe. Friends and acquaintances all advised him to seek treatment quickly, but Lu regarded it as a common disease and did not pay much attention to it. As time went on, his illness became more serious. He rested in Shanghai, but sometimes he suffered from a lack of medical care. He relied on Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek and various comrades for occasional assistance. Now that we have heard of his death, we are recording what we know to tell the readers.</p>
<h3>Important News from the Yangtze River Shipping Sector</h3>
<p>Rushing to Transport Piece Goods: This Year's Implementation of the Gregorian Calendar Overturns Lunar Calendar Settlement. Consequently, the Yangtze River ports' merchants stopped accepting goods and making loans due to the silver currency business. However, in early December, the central government, acceding to the request of Shanghai merchants, approved Gregorian calendar settlements with payments due by February 15. This decision, formally passed by the National Government's meeting, prompted Yangtze River merchants to send telegrams to Shanghai to procure goods and rush shipments to upstream ports. Since December 20, the outbound vessels of the Shanghai Yangtze River Six Companies have been overwhelmed, particularly with cotton yarn and piece goods. At least 3,000 items of yarn and cloth are shipped daily to Hankou, Yichang, Changsha, and Chongqing. It is estimated that there are over 40,000 packages to be shipped out within ten days. In addition, the advance shipment of Japanese sugar to Hankou this month is also extremely congested. Recently, Yangtze River ships are almost fully loaded for outbound voyages.</p>
<p>Examination of Pilots: The Yangtze River Pilot Training School is Dedicated to Training Talented Pilots and Reclaiming Lost Sovereignty. The first class is about to graduate. The school has been busy with examinations for several days. The Director of the Coastal Patrol has also been invited to the Yangtze River ships of various companies to conduct oral examinations of the pilots serving on each ship. The examinations have been conducted on each ship since the 17th and were completed the day before yesterday. A notice has been issued to various shipping companies stating that the determination of the qualification of the pilots who took the examination has been completed and the scores are being reviewed. The names of the qualified personnel who took the examination will be posted at the entrance of the school on January 6 and 7, and all candidates are invited to come and view them at that time. The graduation ceremony for the trained personnel will be held on the 7th, when diplomas will be awarded.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Bandits: Yangtze River Vessels Suffer Most from Bandits. The other day, a thief dressed in very fashionable clothes, about 20 years old and from Taixing, pretended to be a passenger on the Taikoo Poyang ship while it was loading cargo in the port. He stole a seaman's trunk and fled. It was about 6:00 PM, and the thief took the opportunity to steal the trunk while the cargo and people were crowded. The owner, a seaman, happened to see the trunk and recognized it as his own. He grabbed the thief, brought him back to the ship, interrogated him about the theft, and handed him over to the police for punishment. On the Pukou side, there are even more pier bandits. Passengers are often robbed of their luggage and money by four or five bandits. The number of victims is countless. The Three Companies' piers are especially plagued. The other day, victims reported to the shipping bureau. The Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company decided to rectify the situation to ensure the safety of travelers. The company issued a notice to the business directors of each Yangtze River ship, ordering them to earnestly assist passengers in handing over the bandits to the pier police for strict handling. At the same time, the pier police in Pukou were ordered to strictly prohibit these bandits from entering the piers. From now on, if any bandits rob luggage, they will be immediately arrested. Li Zhonggong's actions have truly benefited the traveling community, as the banditry in that area has been rampant for decades.</p>
<h3>Japanese Fishing Vessels</h3>
<p>Investigation into Offshore Fishing Infringements.</p>
<p>Various Fishing Companies Have Requested Negotiations.</p>
<p>The loss of rights due to Japanese fishermen invading coastal fisheries is unknown. According to the daily survey, there are 24 Japanese fishing vessels infringing on aquatic products along the coasts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The various items are recorded as follows: (1) Two Japanese fishing vessels, Taisei Maru No. 2 and No. 11, are owned by Mr. Nagai of Shimonoseki, Japan. Each vessel has a deadweight of 50 tons and a horsepower of 80. They came to Shanghai in the spring of this year. In the first half of the year, they fished four times in the coastal waters of our country, averaging 600 boxes of fish each time, with each box weighing 30 catties. The agent listed on the box is Jidao Trading Company. (2) Two Japanese fishing vessels, Taisei Maru No. 10 and No. 16, are also owned by Mr. Nagai of Shimonoseki, Japan. The deadweight and horsepower are the same as Nos. 10 and 11. They came to Shanghai in October of this year and fished once, catching 1,300 boxes of fish. The agent is Fukushima Trading Company. (3) Two Japanese fishing vessels, Hakuto Maru No. 1 and No. 2, are owned by Mr. Hamai Mononosuke of Shimonoseki, Japan. Each vessel has a deadweight of 50 tons and a horsepower of 100. They came to Shanghai in April of this year and fished a total of four times, catching 2,800 boxes of fish. (4) Two Japanese fishing vessels, Suo Maru No. 1 and No. 2, are owned by Mr. Hamai Kamiko of Shimonoseki, Japan. Each vessel has a deadweight of 50 tons and a horsepower of 100. They came to Shanghai in March of this year and fished four times, catching 3,200 boxes of fish. (5) Two Japanese fishing vessels, Showa Maru, details unknown. (6) Two Japanese fishing vessels, Manten Maru No. 1 and No. 2, are owned by Mr. Onoki Keika of Dalian. The deadweight tonnage of the vessels is unknown, but each has a horsepower of 50. They came to Shanghai in January of this year and have already fished 12 times, averaging 400 boxes of fish each time. (7) Two Japanese fishing vessels, Toyo Maru No. 1 and No. 2, each has a deadweight of 30 tons. They came to Shanghai in November of last year and have fished a total of 20 times, catching 400 boxes of fish each time. The Shanghai office is located in Arui Li, North Sichuan Road, and is operated by a Japanese woman. (8) Two Japanese fishing vessels, Daishin Maru No. 1 and No. 2, are owned by the Daishin Group of Shimonoseki, Japan. Each vessel has a deadweight of 50 tons and a horsepower of 50. They came to Shanghai on November 4 of this year and fished once, catching 1,300 boxes of fish. In addition, there are also two Japanese fishing vessels, Minken Maru No. 11 and No. 12, two Taisei Maru No. 7 and No. 8, and two Heihei Maru, all of which came to Shanghai in November of this year. All of the above vessels are of Japanese nationality and openly infringe on our Jiang-Zhe coastal waters, using Shanghai as their base, and each time delivering the caught fish to the fish market in the Sixteenth Pier to be sold on their behalf. Their purpose is to suppress our country's fishermen and fishing industry. Moreover, due to the economic downturn in Japan in recent years, fish prices have plummeted. More than 2,000 groups of hand-operated fishing vessels nationwide are in a difficult situation to maintain, so there are many people who intend to come to Shanghai to operate. This has a significant impact on our country's maritime rights, fishing interests, national economy, and people's livelihood. Our country's government and people must not take this lightly. The Sanxing Fishing Wheel Bureau, the Zhonghua Fishing Wheel Bureau, and the Huanghai Fishing Wheel Bureau of this port have yesterday submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry, the Jiangsu Agricultural and Mining Department, and the Shanghai Municipal Government for serious negotiations. The submission is recorded as follows (omitted above): Japan's imperialists have been engaging in fishing in the seas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang for years, even selling their catch in Shanghai. Our country's officials and people have negotiated with the Japanese consul many times, but with little effect. In the spring and summer of last year, the Shanghai fishing wheel companies tried their best to resist the increasing number of Japanese fishing wheels coming to Shanghai, and then they found a way to limit the Japanese fishing wheels from paying taxes at the Jianghai North Customs, charging 1.5 yuan per burden, with the hope that their heavy tax burden would prevent them from coming to Shanghai again. Now, due to the economic downturn, a large number of Japanese fishing wheels are often imported. It seems that there is an organization that seems to have great connections for our country's merchants. Our bureau and others have witnessed the loss of rights and humiliation of the country, and have suffered from economic oppression. How can we tolerate this? We are limited by our powers and have no choice but to jointly request that the Shanghai fish market stalls be strictly forbidden from selling goods from Japanese fishing wheels in order to make a thorough resistance. In particular, they must not use the excuse that the fresh goods imported to Shanghai are stored in cold storage in Nagasaki and are not caught from Chinese waters, nor that the concession is a commercial port and it is illegal to trade with foreigners as a pretext. In our humble opinion, this is not enough to stop them. Otherwise, in a blink of an eye, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang fish market will be manipulated by the Japanese fishing wheels, and the Jiangsu and Zhejiang seas will be plundered by the Japanese fishing wheels. We are submitting a special request to strictly prohibit the fish market stalls from selling fresh goods from Japanese fishing wheels in order to maintain the fishing industry and protect our sovereignty. We are very fortunate to do so. President,</p>
<p>Xie Yifei and Zhou Meiting of Sanxing Shipping Wheel Bureau, Gong Guoliang of Zhonghua Fishing Wheel Bureau, and Wang Zikang of Huanghai Fishing Wheel Bureau respectfully submit.</p>

<h3>Preparations for Correcting Traffic Schedules on Two Railways</h3>
<p>New Locomotives Have Great Speed. The Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus have been trying to improve the punctuality of their traffic schedules. Therefore, they have purchased new locomotives with greater horsepower from overseas in preparation for using the new locomotives to haul special express trains starting from New Year's Day next year. On the one hand, they will increase speed and shorten travel time, and on the other hand, they will correct time to ensure accuracy. It is said that the maximum speed of the new locomotives is about 56 miles per hour. The railway will determine the speed to be between 45 and 50 miles per hour. If the trains are operated at this speed, then the journey from Nanjing to Shanghai (192 miles) can be reached in at most six hours.</p>
<h3>Approval of Year-End Bonuses for Two Railways in January</h3>
<p>The Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have greatly developed their business last year, and their profits have increased significantly. In order to encourage employees, the Ministry of Railways has revised the year-end bonus method, that is, 20% of the profits will be used as bonuses and issued in accordance with the regulations. All employees on the two railways are happy and praised. This year, since Liu Weichi took over the management of the two railways, he has been paying more attention to reorganizing the business, which is comparable to last year. However, the reorganization costs have been heavy, so the calculated profit is only more than 3 million. According to the regulations, only one and a half months can be given. The employees of the railway are all eagerly waiting for the issuance as the end of the year approaches. According to reliable sources, the Ministry of Railways has approved the issuance of one month's salary a few days ago, and the official document has also reached the bureau. It is also learned that the Ministry of Railways is still considering approving the remaining half-month.</p>

<h3>### Fire in a Brush Workshop, Cries for Help Abound</h3>
<p>Awakened from a dream, everyone fled for their lives. Over thirty people unharmed. Yesterday morning at 5:30, a fire broke out in the brush workshop operated by Qian Huiting from Taixing, located at No. 7, Yongnian Lane, Liugong Temple Lane, in the city. The house consisted of two buildings. Besides the brush workshop, the second landlord was in the jade business. The two households housed over thirty people. When the fire started, the ladder was immediately burned through, and cries for help echoed outside. Yang Jubao, the lane watchman, sounded the alarm and reported to the fire brigade. When the fire trucks arrived, they worked diligently to extinguish the blaze until after 8:00 AM. Afterwards, it was estimated that two buildings at No. 7 and one bay of the building at the adjacent No. 8 and No. 9 were destroyed. Fortunately, everyone was awakened from their sleep and fled for their lives, and no one was injured. Afterwards, He Shizhong, the patrol officer of the Second Precinct, Second Division, detained Wei Xingchi, a partner in the brush workshop, and Wen Xiaoshun, a partner in the jade workshop. According to Wei Xingchi's statement during interrogation by Chief Guo: "I help people make brushes. The old boss is Qian Huiting, but the old boss's wife is currently in her hometown, whereabouts unknown. I sleep on the second floor. The second landlord, Zhou Pinshan, lives there. His apprentice's bed might have had an oil lamp lit, and he might have started the fire." According to Yang Jubao, the lane watchman: "I have been guarding the gate of Yongnian Lane for seven years. Yesterday morning, I was not asleep when I heard cries for help. When I ran to look, the fire was all on the second floor. It seemed to have started on the second floor, and the ladder had already been burned through. I suspect it was Zhou's apprentice who caused the fire," and so on. Chief Guo dispatched police to investigate the cause of the fire. It is said that No. 7 had fire insurance, so all the people and witnesses involved in the case were immediately sent to the Public Security Bureau for legal action.</p>
<h3>### Conflict Between Tram and Car Drivers Results in Traffic Disruption</h3>
<p>The cause was minor, but the conflict escalated greatly, disrupting traffic for an hour. Yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM, Car No. 24 of the China Merchants Tramway Route 3, Circular Route, was traveling on Zhonghua Road in front of the Yaojia Lane entrance of Dadongmen when a Shanghai-South Public Car Route 3, Circular Route was on the tracks. The tram driver drove forward, colliding with the car. Fortunately, the driver braked sharply, avoiding serious damage. The car driver was furious and cursed the tram driver for driving slowly on the tracks, causing the collision. People persuaded them to separate. However, at the terminal station of the tram and car on Minguo Road near Xiaodongmen, the drivers of the tram and the car started fighting. At the same time, drivers who were off duty and workers repairing the road were also drawn into the conflict. The car driver was no match for the others. When the patrol officer arrived to mediate, the car driver's face was already swollen. He demanded to be taken to the station. The patrol officer then ordered the tram driver to go to the station, but the driver refused, leading to another conflict with the patrol officer. The location was a key junction for the tram tracks, so five or six trams and cars were stopped, causing a traffic disruption lasting for an hour. Later, the patrol captain and inspectors from both companies arrived at the scene, recorded the drivers' numbers, and reported to the bureau for investigation. Traffic was then restored to its original state.</p>
<h3>### Store Employee Conspires with Thieves to Commit Robbery</h3>
<p>Repeatedly retracting his confession and falsely accusing the store's shareholder of conspiracy. Last Thursday night (the 25th) at 11:00 PM, four bandits suddenly arrived at the Ruixingchang Cigarette Paper Store at No. 925 Broadway. Two bandits with handguns drove the store employees into one room for strict surveillance. They then demanded the key from the accountant, Cai Dafen, and opened the silver box in the store. Seeing that there were only a few banknotes and foreign currency inside, they took it and put it in their pockets. They then questioned Cai about where he hid the rest. Cai insisted that there was nothing else. Dissatisfied, the bandits went upstairs to search and found an iron box in the loft. Because Cai had not been forthcoming, they slapped his cheeks. Cai dared not resist and handed over the key. The bandits opened the box and robbed all the banknotes, silver dollars, and small change it contained, leaving nothing behind. After the store employees recounted that the bandits had left for a distant place, they dared to make it known and checked the losses, which amounted to more than 5,400 yuan. They immediately reported to the Huishan Concession Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives Su Changsheng and Hughes to the store to investigate. They suspected the store employee Li Yaozu and took him to the police station for questioning. Li confessed that he had gone out alone at 7:30 PM after dinner, intending to go to the Wing On Company to play. He had not informed his colleagues before leaving. On the way, he met Wang Aliu, whom he knew, and instructed Wang to gather accomplices and quickly go to Ruixingchang to rob the store. He said that he could get three or four hundred yuan in spoils. They agreed to split the spoils at Room 325 of the Dongya Hotel on Nanjing Road. He then returned to the store after 10:00 PM. The detectives immediately went to the Dongya to search for accomplices, but learned that Room 325 was opened by a Mr. Zhang, the manager of a Wuxi flour mill, and it was not convenient to enter the room to search. They then asked Li where his accomplices were hiding, and he said that they might be in Room 316 of the Dongya, but the occupant of that room was a dancer, and it was also not convenient to enter the room to search. Therefore, Li was temporarily detained. The next morning, Chinese and foreign detectives continued to investigate at Ruixingchang and recovered a fake handgun left behind by the bandits during their escape. They also summoned the store shareholders Lin Hongtang, Liu Dinghe, and Cai Dafen to the police station to strictly interrogate Li. Li suddenly falsely accused shareholder Liu Dinghe of also conspiring and said that Wang Aliu lived at No. 80 Caojiawan in the city. The police chief sent detectives to Wang's home, but found nothing. Therefore, on the morning before, they escorted Li to the Special District Local Court to request a strict investigation. First, the Chinese and foreign detectives reported the circumstances after the case occurred. Then, Cai Dafen recounted the robbery, and the store shareholder and manager Liu Dinghe also appeared in court, claiming that he had been in charge of managing the store's money. In August, he had entrusted the accountant Cai because he was ill. The defendant had been in the store for seven years and had no improper behavior. He suddenly harbored malice and falsely accused him of conspiracy, which he really did not understand. Judge Ge then questioned Li, but his confession contradicted everything he had said at the police station, claiming that he did not know Wang Aliu and that he had gone out alone after dinner that night, first going to the Yuanfang Road Tongle Hall to eat a serving of dumplings, staying for half an hour, then going to the Bund and the Sincere Company near Nanjing Road, intending to buy shoes, but failing to do so, and then returning to the store. He said that all the confessions he had made at the police station the day before were lies. Detective Su added that the defendant's father ran a teahouse in Caojiawan, where Wang Aliu also lived and often went to drink tea, and that he had discussed the matter with the defendant several times beforehand. Moreover, the store shareholders Liu Dinghe and others had personally witnessed the defendant's confessions at the police station, so how could he deny it? Judge Ge ordered the defendant to be detained and rescheduled the trial.</p>
<h3>### Jiang Meiying Sues Husband for Bigamy</h3>
<p>Requests a divorce decree. Husband also submits a statement to the court, saying that his wife has remarried to an official. Orders preliminary mediation. Nanjing woman Jiang Meiying hired lawyer He Xianzhang to sue her husband, Li Jing'an, in the local court for abandonment and bigamy, requesting a divorce. The complaint stated that they had not been married long when her husband's affection was lost, and they had been separated for six or seven years, so their feelings could be imagined and it would be difficult to reconcile. Moreover, her husband had already remarried, making it even more difficult to harmonize, and so on. After receiving the notice of the lawsuit, Li Jing'an also hired lawyer Hu Fenglian to defend himself, stating that the plaintiff had already remarried and married another man. He had already sued her in the Special District Court of the concession, and the circumstances were quite interesting. This case was heard yesterday by Judge Tong Shenglv. Jiang Meiying testified that she was thirty-one years old and currently resided in Baotai Lane in the French Concession. I was in my mother's home and inherited the second house, so at the age of eighteen, my adoptive mother and elder brother arranged for me to marry the defendant. Not long after, the defendant asked me for money and, when he did not get it, took my clothes to gamble and smoke opium. That is why I left at the age of twenty-five and helped a couple at Li Huchen's house. We never communicated. Relatives said that on June 20 of the sixteenth year of the Republic [1927], the defendant remarried in Nanjing to Sha Qiheng's daughter on Ping'an Street. The matchmakers were Xiong Shaoru and Liu Wenzao. Therefore, I request a divorce, and so on. The defendant, Li Jing'an, testified that he was twenty-nine years old and lived at No. 84 Zixia Road. In September of the sixth year of the Republic [1917], he married the plaintiff at Diaoyutai in Nanjing through matchmakers Zhou Guangfu and Hua Xiangzheng. Her biological father was named Jiang Xingjie, her adoptive mother was named Jiang Mu, and her brother Jiang Su was the one who arranged the marriage. My family runs the Dinghesheng Foreign Goods Company in Hao County, Anhui, and travels to Shanghai and other places every year. The plaintiff lived in Hao County, but she did not like living there, so she sent her to live with her mother's family in Shanghai. I have already had a son with her who is thirteen years old and a daughter who is nine years old. This time, I went to my mother-in-law's house at No. 90 Bazilu to pick up my wife, but my mother-in-law did not recognize me as her son-in-law and ordered me to call her uncle's wife because my mother-in-law was originally a close relative of my family. I was greatly surprised and did not know why. Then I asked the servant and learned that the plaintiff had married someone else. I tried to persuade my brother-in-law Jin Zhuzhen and my mother-in-law's nephew Ma Puqing to mediate, but to no avail, so I have already requested the Special District Court to confirm the marriage against the plaintiff and to hand over the people to my parents-in-law, wife's brother, etc. A divorce decree has not yet been issued, and the official does not want to let this case complicate matters and prolong lives. Both parties should first attempt reconciliation. If that does not work, the court will reopen and hear arguments. He then left the court.</p>
<h3>### Strict Security in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>The heads of the Jing'an Temple, Gordon Road, and Putuo Road police stations in Western Shanghai, in order to strictly prevent and protect residents from the recent series of kidnapping cases within the concession, specially ordered each Western police officer to lead two Japanese police officers and four Chinese police officers, wearing iron vests, starting the day before yesterday at 8:00 AM every day. They were divided into teams and sent to patrol on Great Western Road, Hongqiao Road, Jessfield Road, Gordon Road, Hardoon Road, Yu Yuen Road, and Jiaozhou Road. Each team patrolled each road every five hours until 10:00 PM in the evening. They rotated on duty, patrolling and inspecting back and forth on each road. They strictly searched all passing cars, and the security was quite thorough.</p>
<h3>### Jingdong Warship Repels Pirates Outside Wusong Estuary</h3>
<p>Detains one pirate leader and captures three accomplices. Wen Guangming, the captain of the Third Squad, Seventeenth Team of the Wusong Water Police District and commander of the Jingdong warship, received a secret report at around 9:00 PM the day before yesterday that a pirate ship had suddenly arrived at the Guangyi Village West Port. Over fifty pirates had landed there and gathered in the Guanquan area, hoping to carry out a major looting. After receiving the report, Captain Wen immediately led administrator Xiao Renshan and patrol officers to suppress the pirates. Unexpectedly, the pirates also opened fire to resist arrest. The two sides attacked each other for over ten minutes. The pirates' strength was insufficient, and they fled in defeat. The officers and police arrested Yin Xiqiao, Mao Xiaofu, Gong Huating, Gong Ruichu, and other four people and sent them to the headquarters of the brigade. After interrogation by Brigade Commander Gong Mianqin, the pirates all confessed to specializing in looting cargo ships and kidnapping people for ransom. Yin Xiqiao also confessed that he was the pirate leader and commander. After verifying their confessions, Brigade Commander Gong sent the four pirates to the Qidong County Government for legal action yesterday morning and submitted a report to District Chief Zhang.</p>
<h3>### Forged Check Used to Defraud Funds</h3>
<p>Mao Bingsheng Impersonates Someone to Commit Fraud, Fortunately Bank Notices and Arrests Him. Mao Bingsheng suddenly went to the Tongchun Qianzhuang [money exchange shop] a few days ago, claiming to be an employee of the Tong Yutai store. He gave the shop's accountant a Jiangnan Bank check for 1,600 taels of silver, requesting that it be deposited into the Tong Yutai account. Then, he presented a money withdrawal slip with the Tong Yutai stamp on it, requesting 2,000 yuan in foreign currency. According to the qianzhuang's usual practice, for regular customers, withdrawals are generally based on the shop's ledger. The accountant became suspicious because Mao did not bring a ledger, and then noticed that the Tong Yutai stamp had many flaws. He called to inquire and received a reply that no one had been sent to withdraw funds. At this time, the person sent to the Jiangnan Bank to verify the check also returned, saying that the check was not issued by Jiangnan. Thus, Mao's black market scheme of forging checks and impersonating someone to deceive large amounts of money was completely exposed. The manager of the Tongchun Qianzhuang then handed Mao over, along with the forged check, to the shop's security guard to take to the Laozha Police Station for detention. The next morning, he was sent to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Xu Ting interrogated him. The defendant confessed that the check had been given to him by another person, who had ordered him to withdraw the cash. The police lawyer, Zhuang Baoyi, then immediately requested an extension in order to investigate his accomplices. Judge Xu granted his request and ordered the defendant to be returned to custody and rescheduled the trial.</p>
<h3>### A Car Kills a Rickshaw Puller</h3>
<p>Liu Dengliang, age eighteen, from Jiangbei, lived in a flat in Zifu Lane, Xinqiao, Shanchang Factory, and made a living pulling a rickshaw. Yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, Liu pulled his rickshaw to the entrance of the Huashang Hotel on Xinmin Road, Zhabei. Suddenly, a Ford truck, Concession Permit No. 5239, City Permit No. 33, owned by the Hongtai Wood Company on Medhurst Road, driven by the driver Lu Shengbao (age twenty-eight), was speeding and failed to avoid him in time, knocking both the rickshaw and the person to the ground. Liu's right leg bone was broken, and he was bleeding profusely, losing consciousness. The rickshaw was also badly damaged. Afterwards, the patrol police from the First Division of the Fourth District arrived and detained the driver Lu Shengbao at the station. After Director Yao interrogated him, he immediately prepared a document to submit to the judicial section to deal with the car accident that injured someone. He ordered the police car to send him to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but due to excessive bleeding, he died at 4:30 PM that afternoon.</p>
<h3>### Unexpected Wealth Causes Dispute</h3>
<p>A rogue extorts money. A child picked up a paper package from the ground in front of the East-West Huade Universal Theater at around 4:00 PM last Friday. Upon opening it, he saw that there were over 1,000 yuan in banknotes and foreign currency. He went home and gave it to his father. However, the matter was not kept secret and was heard by rogues in the neighborhood, who extorted money from the child's father. He reluctantly agreed to give them 500 yuan and agreed to hand over the money at Yile Tian Teahouse yesterday afternoon. However, he also notified the Hongkou Police Station, requesting that they arrest the extortionists on the spot at that time. The police chief immediately dispatched detectives as scheduled, taking the five rogues to the police station for questioning.</p>
<h3>### Shi Zhiming Accused of Kidnapping a Young Woman</h3>
<p>Zhang Guangtai, age thirty-nine, from Taizhou, Jiangbei, resides at No. 156, Labor Road, Xihua Yarn Factory, Western Shanghai, and operates a catering business. He has a daughter named Lan Ying, age sixteen, who is quite beautiful and loved by her father. She currently works in the Xihua Yarn Factory, going to work in the morning and returning in the evening, and is very diligent. She was engaged to a man from her hometown through a matchmaker this summer. However, because of Lan Ying's beautiful appearance, she was coveted by others. Recently, Shi Zhiming, also from Taizhou, age twenty-eight, who caters at Zhang's place, has often tried to flirt with the girl after work and has used all kinds of tricks to seduce her in secret. The girl, being young and ignorant, was eventually misled by him. On the afternoon of the 23rd of this month at 5:00 PM, the girl had just left work and returned home when she went out with Shi. Zhang did not think much of it. However, when the girl had still not returned by late at night, Zhang was greatly alarmed. After inquiring, he learned that Shi had been seducing her for a long time and had undoubtedly kidnapped her. He immediately sent out people to investigate, but to no avail. Until the afternoon before, Zhang twisted and caught Shi at a nearby workshop and questioned him about where he had hidden the girl. Shi stubbornly remained cunning. Zhang immediately called the police and detained him at the Sixth District Police Station. After Director Ren of the district interrogated him, he specially prepared a document to send to the local court for trial yesterday because the case involved kidnapping a young woman.</p>

She met a stranger near the Great World in the French Concession who tricked her into believing he could recommend her to an employer with a monthly salary of 20 yuan. She believed him and followed him. She was taken to Pudong and sold for 120 yuan. Realizing she had been sold, she took advantage of a gap and escaped. Unable to find her way back, she wandered for a day and a night and was still in the Pudong area. She arrived at the 31st District of Sanlintang, unable to walk further and hungry, so she sat down and cried, even trying to kill herself.

<h3>A Petition to Chairman Chiang to Promote Radio Education by Wen Fangziwei</h3>
<p>Fangziwei presented a document to Chairman Chiang yesterday, saying: "A Petition on the Importance of Radio Education, Humbly Requesting Guidance and Assistance to Promote Cultivation and Develop the Radio Industry. In recent decades, the most rapid advancement in applied science has been radio science. The investment is the most economical, the application is widespread and rapid, and it is only the radio industry. The great global current affairs change the communication of the world market situation, and the climate measurement and verification of various places, to the application of image transmission, remote control machinery, navigation orientation, and medical treatment. The dissemination of popular lectures by famous scholars, songs by entertainers, and folk entertainment all depend on radio to succeed. The transmission of news is instantaneous, and the benefits to industry and commerce are many. The relationship with military and political secrets is especially close. European and American advanced countries are still making continuous efforts to improve and refine their technology. Construction has been grand, and the cultivation of talent is even more important. The land, sea, and air force departments have their own research and testing institutes. The Bureau of Standards of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and various manufacturing plants have also established special research institutes. Various universities have also established engineering specialties, and radio vocational schools are also lined up to enrich talent. The use of convenient results is obtained, and progress is accelerated. Looking back at China's radio industry, it is far behind others and has a sense of frustration. Since the establishment of the national foundation, there has been a vigorous development, and radio stations in various cities have been established one after another. The international radio station has just been completed. Only radio education is still to be started and has not yet sprouted. Talent is based on talent and talent is based on education. If there is no one to ask for the establishment of a career, it is like climbing a tree to find fish. Ziwei has learned from this and has long had the ambition to create a school to cultivate talents. However, due to economic difficulties, he has not been able to achieve it for many years. Last autumn, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, Zhao Tieqiao, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Fang Jiaobo and other gentlemen heard about it and promoted its completion, so they invited Mr. Zhao and other six people to be the school directors and established the school in Shanghai. It was named the China Radio Engineering School. Since its opening, although it has relied on the vigorous support and guidance of the school directors, and the serious management of the school, students from all over the world have come one after another. However, the funding is often insufficient, so the management is sparse and only one year has passed. Although I dare not say what achievements have been made, I can still ask myself without shame. The teaching and management are strictly enforced, and the practical testing must be practical. All that can be done is to do everything sincerely. It is planned to purchase the latest radio equipment and prime mover engines and various machines. But I always feel that the scale is narrow, the cultivation is difficult to expand, and the ability is thin and the expansion is lacking. Thinking that China's radio industry has expanded from the beginning, its education has not yet been popularized. Now, when the chairman is also in charge of the Ministry of Education, he is personally in charge of the national head of the department, which shows that you are very determined to organize the national education. All education related to industry is expected to be cared for and cherished by you. Radio's benefits to industry and commerce are small. Although we are now in a position to prevent people from opening up the world, we should also prevent people from opening up the world. The great unity of the world is what we want, and the preparation for the war cannot be ignored. What is the preparation for the future war? Only aircraft, poisonous gas, and radio. There is poisonous gas, but airplanes are still needed to throw them. There are airplanes, but they still rely on rapid driving and command. Radio is the only way to seek rapid driving and command. It is radio that can save the country in times of chaos and benefit industry and commerce in times of peace. Therefore, the European and American countries are all striving to study this technique and cultivate talents without wasting any effort. The people are built at the bottom, and the government rewards them at the top. They work together to make progress and invent new things every day. Looking back at our country, we have not yet stipulated the radio legal system, and the number of industrial schools is very small. Ziwei has been in this position for a long time and has the idea of establishing this school, but in the end it is difficult to build due to economic difficulties. At this time, the unification is completed, the training is started, and the talent is urgent. I would like to submit my feelings to you with all my heart and humbly ask you to give guidance so that there will be a follow-up and humbly ask you to consider and assist the department so that the vegetarian can expand and make great achievements. I am not overwhelmed with anticipation, and I respectfully present it to the Minister of Education, Chiang.</p>

<h3>Transfer of Funds from the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>Actually Only a Little Over 7,000 Yuan. The transfer of funds and the details of the takeover by the Ministry of Education were reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to a more detailed account from an important official in the ministry, which is more accurate than what was reported yesterday, we are publishing it again as follows: The Ministry of Education had a total of 130 employees up to the day of the transfer by the previous administration, which was relatively streamlined compared to other ministries, and the salary expenditure was also less than other ministries. Other expenses were also relatively economical, so the actual monthly expenditure was slightly less than the original budget. The total amount transferred to the new administration was over 50,050 yuan. However, after deducting 24,000 yuan designated by the previous administration for the ministry's construction costs and tens of thousands of yuan for salaries to be paid, along with income tax to be reported and miscellaneous temporary deposits, the actual cash transferred to the new administration was only around 7,000 yuan. As for the funds owed to the ministry by the Ministry of Finance, the exact amount owed is still being calculated because the previous administration's transfer list has not yet been completed, and the new administration's takeover procedures have not been finalized.</p>

<h3>Dr. Huang Zhongqiang Returns to China</h3>
<p>Dr. Huang Zhongqiang, after graduating from Tongji Medical School in Shanghai, went to Germany in the winter of the 11th year of the Republic to study internal and external medicine, as well as obstetrics and pediatrics, at the University of Göttingen. His article "Cancer of the Lumbar Region" was highly regarded by Professor EKaufmann, the director of the pathology department. After obtaining his medical doctorate in the 17th year of the Republic, he worked as a clinician in the surgery department of the Göttingen Surgical Hospital for two years and was a top student of the famous surgery professor Profrstich. Therefore, his knowledge and experience are very rich. Dr. Huang has now returned to China via the Siberian Railway and arrived in Shanghai the other day. It is said that he will open a clinic in Beijing and Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Jinan University Implements Austerity Measures to Reduce Expenses</h3>
<p>Jinan University has consistently had the lowest expenditures and the most significant achievements among national universities. Recently, due to insufficient funding, the university has been facing significant financial difficulties. The 18th university affairs meeting resolved to implement austerity measures to reduce expenses. The position of vice-president was also eliminated in accordance with the order. The heads of the middle school departments resumed their previous positions as directors. Mr. Hong Ziling was appointed as the vice-chairman of the university affairs meeting and concurrently served as the director of the middle school department. The original director of the registration section, Pan Chuitong, and the director of the general affairs section, Wu Bangjie, were introduced by President Zheng to various agencies in Qingdao, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. In addition, the school's finances have been handled by accountant Xi Yushu, and the school strives to achieve pure academic and rationalized operations, which is also a characteristic. Furthermore, the school's Boy Scout group held its third anniversary celebration yesterday. In the morning, the group leader, Shen Yu, led a parade and flag-raising ceremony, and a review was conducted. In the evening, a campfire and recreational activities were held, which were extremely lively.</p>
<h3>The Mingfu Library of the China Science Society Opens on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>| Book Exhibition Held Simultaneously | New Year's Party for Society Members in the Evening |</p>
<p>The China Science Society founded the Science Library in the society's headquarters on Chengxian Street, Nanjing, in the fourth year of the Republic, as a reference for scientific researchers. At that time, most of the books were donated and deposited by members, numbering only a few thousand volumes. Over the past ten years, efforts have been made to select and purchase books, and donations or exchanges have been received from famous academic institutions in various countries. The collection has grown annually, and by the 18th year, it had reached more than 37,000 volumes. In recent years, the board of directors of the society believed that the Nanjing Library and the Central University Library were very close to each other, and their book collections were inevitably duplicated. Given the current lack of libraries in various parts of our country, it is not economical to have two libraries with similar characteristics in the same location. Therefore, it was decided that, except for the biology and agricultural science sections, which would remain in the Beijing Society Library for reference by the Biology Research Institute, the rest would be stored in a newly built library at another location. Shanghai was considered the center of industry and commerce, with a highly developed material civilization, but there was no library to meet the public's needs for scientific research. Therefore, land was purchased at 533 Albert Road to build the Mingfu Library. The name "Mingfu" was chosen to commemorate Mr. Hu Mingfu, the founder of the society. The library building occupies more than 5,500 square feet and has three floors, all built with fireproof materials. The style is simple and elegant, and the equipment is complete. The steel bookshelves in the library were custom-made in the United States and can hold 220,000 volumes of thick books. Construction began in September of last year and lasted for more than a year. The design and supervision of the work were very painstaking. It is scheduled to officially open at 2:00 PM on New Year's Day of the 20th year of the Republic. The society's directors, Cai Yuanpei, Ma Xiangbo, and Wu Zhihui, will give speeches. Various ministries and commissions of the National Government, local agencies, consuls from various countries, and famous Chinese and Western figures have all been invited. At the same time, a Chinese book exhibition will be held from January 1st to 6th, lasting for six days. Preparations have been underway for a month, and the arrangements are now complete. Book collectors from various places have responded enthusiastically. As of yesterday, the following have been received: Song Dynasty rare editions from the Central Research Institute's Qianqunbi Library, the Quelang Shang Tieqin Copper Sword Building, the Commercial Press Hanfen Building, Liu Hanyi Jia Ye Building, the National Beiping Library, and the Jiangsu National Studies Library; fine editions from Di Chuqing, Xu Jiyu, Baishanfu, Huang Binhong, Gong Zhonghu, Jin Songqing, and Dong Suijing; and Zhao Yaonong, among others, all have excellent exhibits. The most outstanding items include Northern Song Dynasty carved scriptures, Sui and Tang Dynasty handwritten scriptures, oracle bone inscriptions, clay seals, and ancient seals. Other notable items include ancient woodcuts and single-color and five-color paintings from Ding Shuyan of Shandong and others, as well as ancient European and Indian versions of engraving by Zhang Feng. Bookstores such as the Commercial Press, China Bookstore, Zhengzhong Bookstore, and China Science Company are also exhibiting their products. It is reported that tickets can be obtained by writing to the society. Viewing hours are set from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily, except on the afternoon of New Year's Day, when the exhibition will be closed to the public for half a day. The society's members, in celebration of New Year's Day and the opening of the new library, have scheduled a New Year's Party at the Xin Xin Restaurant at 7:00 PM on New Year's Day.</p>
<h3>New Year's Party for Society Members</h3>
<p>In addition to speeches by Cai Yuanpei, Wang Yunwu, and Chu Minyi, there will be music by Chinese and Western ladies and gentlemen, children's string orchestras, magic shows, scientific activities, and films. All members, relatives, and friends are welcome to participate.</p>

<h3>Resolutions of the China National Sports Association Board Meeting</h3>
<p>Lehua players have not violated amateur rules, but the accounts of the expedition team must be audited immediately. Efforts will be made to restore the qualifications of Cao Guicheng and Chen Guangyao.</p>
<p>The amateur status of the Lehua football team members has attracted the attention of people across the country and has become an important event in the sports world. Yesterday, the board of directors of the China National Sports Advancement Association held a regular meeting. In addition to welcoming board member Chu Minyi and reporting on association affairs, the most important case on the agenda was the amateur status of the Lehua players. When it was brought up for discussion, the investigating committee first presented the investigation process and its results. The attending directors then carefully studied it and, after consulting various evidence, sympathized with and formally approved the investigating committee's opinion. Thus, the qualifications of the Lehua players have been clarified, and their reputation for integrity has been preserved. However, there is a deadline for auditing the accounts of the China expedition team. As for the innocent football stars Cao Guicheng and Chen Guangyao, who were unable to participate in the games in Hong Kong, there are also plans to help them. However, since both the Western Football Association in Hong Kong and Shanghai are affiliated with the British General Association and have different systems, a detailed letter will be sent to communicate the friendly relationship internationally, so that the decision can be reversed as soon as possible to salvage the situation, so as not to spoil the atmosphere when the sports circles of the two countries are chanting cooperation and working together.</p>
<h3>Zhenru Wins the China Football Association Group B Championship</h3>

<h3>The Leader of the Pack, Heroes Bow Down</h3>
<p>Zhenru's excellent football skills and courageous spirit, five wins in five games, stands alone in Shanghai. The best in Shanghai, the leaders of the pack, heroes bow down. The recent results of the teams in Group B are attached below:</p>
<p>Team Name Games Played Wins Losses Draws Goals For Points</p>
<p>Zhenru 5 5 0 0 43 10</p>

<p>Pagoda 4 0 3 1 3 1</p>
<p>Youth 3 0 3 0 5 0</p>
<h3>Heroes Take the Field to Compete</h3>
<p>The Zhenru team has been fighting hard for days, and the famous players and athletes are exhausted. Yesterday, half of the lineup consisted of new and promising players. The performance was remarkable. The Lingnan players' fighting spirit is commendable, but their teamwork and shooting skills are not as good as Zhenru's. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Zhenru Team:</p>
<p>Zeng Rongzhong (Below) Chen Chunxiu (Below)</p>
<p>(Above) Chen Fuzhong (Above) Luo Haiguang Jiang Zongmian Xie Quanhe Chen Zhenhe Dai Linjing Jiang Meijing Yang Baosen Tong Rongwen Chen Zhenxiang</p>

<h3>Competing for the Championship, Everyone Shows Their Skills</h3>
<p>Yesterday's game was about the honor of this year's championship. Both sides fought hard to determine the winner. Although the score was 6-1, the atmosphere was tense at all times. Lingnan's goalkeeper Tang Yongchun's skills were superb, and his hands and feet were agile. He was always able to find a way out of danger. He is truly a talented individual. Others such as the left central defender Chen Pu and the center forward Chen Hongguang are very promising and different from ordinary players. As for Zhenru's talents, Chen Zhenhe, Dai Linjing, and Jiang Shanjing's achievements are outstanding and are considered giants. The left and right wings have made great contributions, and winning the championship is a matter of course.</p>
<h3>Goalkeeper Tang Resists Strong Opponents</h3>
<p>Referee He Chunhui gave the order to start the game. Lingnan took the initiative to attack. The ball was intercepted by the opponent and invaded from the left. Goalkeeper Tang caught it and averted the danger, passing it to the front. Chen Hongguang ventured out alone but shot it out of the goal. Zhenru launched another attack, and a storm arose in front of Lingnan's goal. The defense was effective, and the ball was turned back. Chen Zhenhe commanded the front three armies to use their orders. Before long, the attack on the Dragon Gate was as dense as raindrops. Goalkeeper Tang resisted the strong enemy, and his contribution was great.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhenhe Takes the Credit</h3>
<p>Lingnan's solid defense from the goalkeeper and the strict defense of the generals has preserved half of the country for 30 minutes. It was not easy. It was not until the left inside defender fouled at the 18-yard box that Chen Zhenhe scored a goal. After this, Zhenru's military momentum became even more fierce. Goalkeeper Tang was in the line of fire and had no rest. Tong Rongwen, Dai Linjing, and Chen Zhenxiang successively fired, accurately and powerfully, but all failed because of the goalkeeper's strength. In the last five minutes, Luo Haiguang and Tong Rongwen scored one header and one kick each. In the first half, Zhenru led 3-0.</p>
<h3>Another Battle, Unfortunate Events</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Zhenru rushed in. Tong Rongwen kicked the ball into the net. In the blink of an eye, the ball flew in from the right. Dai Linjing added another push, and the Dragon Gate was broken again. The loss of two goals seemed to be within five minutes. After this, Zhenru still had the upper hand, but it was difficult to advance because of Lingnan's defense. After ten minutes, Lingnan's forward suddenly gained momentum and went all the way down. Fortunately, Zhenru's goalkeeper was quick-eyed and quick-handed, and was able to turn the danger into safety. At 30 minutes, Luo Haiguang scored another goal, making the score 6-0.</p>
<h3>Regaining a Goal in the Struggle</h3>
<p>Lingnan is certainly not weak and has repeatedly attacked and made great efforts. The reason for stopping halfway and failing to achieve success is that the central defender is too far behind, good at defending but not good at attacking. However, they struggled very hard in the last 15 minutes. Chen Pu took a free kick in the left center area of the field. The drop point was very good, falling in front of the goal. Zhuo Guorong did not fail his mission and lifted his foot to hit the center of the goal, regaining a goal. As a result, Du Ru won 6-1.</p>
<h3>Lehua Suffers a Crushing Defeat Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lost to Shanghai Western Team 1-5</p>
<p>A scene from the Western League A match: Lehua vs. Shanghai Western Team played at Shen Garden Football Field yesterday. As a result, the Shanghai team won 5-1. There were less than a thousand spectators. It was not easy for the Lehua players to temporarily bring together unfamiliar players, and it was even more impossible to defeat the enemy. The appeal was greatly reduced, and the audience still did not understand and scolded harshly, which was embarrassing. Recalling the past glory, one cannot help but feel the change of the times. The lineups of the two sides are as follows:</p>
<h3>Shanghai Team</h3>
<p>Fei Kaosi Stock Stoke Sumer Cole Qiao Taoleer Molo Sinclair Faping Xie Fu Bao Deheng Bai Bolai</p>
<h3>Lehua Team</h3>
<p>Yang Renwei Guan Xunan Gao Dahan Zhou Shaowen Zhou Xianyan Shen Guanlan Lu Zhongen Wang Shusen Jin Fengde Li Lin Chen Yutian</p>
<h3>Shanghai Scores Two Goals in a Quarter of an Hour</h3>
<p>In the lineup confrontation, Shanghai team's right wing Bai Bolai scored a goal for Lehua in seven or eight minutes. Not long after, the blue-eyed right wing Bai passed the ball to right inside forward Bao Deheng. Bao flew up and kicked the ball. Lehua's Zhou Iron Gate could not block it, and they lost another goal. Only six minutes had passed. Lehua suffered this setback and fought bravely to counterattack, but they were unable to do so. Every time they were blocked in front of the enemy's goal line, they were unable to get in.</p>
<p>[PLehua Team Lost Another Third Goal</p>
<p>In the midst of the melee, a siren suddenly sounded outside the field on the road. The Western Customs officers in the field all climbed to the highest level of the stands to look out into the distance. The sound started from the four corners. The audience behind the viewing platform also looked down from a high place to see what was going on. Everyone ignored the football match. At that time, the Shanghai team scored a third goal, thanks to the effort of center forward Sinclair.</p>
<h3>Lehua Scores One Goal in the Second Half</h3>
<p>In the second half, Lehua suddenly showed its strength, dribbling the ball and progressing. Right wing Chen Yutian shot from a distance. Lu Zhongen, Yang Renwei, and others all accelerated to catch up. Lu jumped up and tried to use his heading skills. Shanghai goalkeeper Tao Leer rarely had the opportunity to move around. At this time, the trouble suddenly arose. The goalkeeper was caught off guard and hesitated to advance or retreat. By the time he came forward to struggle, it was too late. The ball slipped into the goal. From then on, everyone was happy, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Finally Wins 5-1</h3>
<p>From then on, Lehua worked even harder and repeatedly pressed on Shanghai's defense zone. Unfortunately, Lehua's shooting was weak and difficult to achieve. The Shanghai team turned the tables and scored two goals in a row. One was kicked in by center forward Xin, and the other was hit by center defender Moro. At the same time, the Shanghai left back was injured and left the field. With only ten players playing, the result was a score of 5-1. Lehua was defeated miserably. The referee was Le Xiurong.</p>

<h3>Record of Shen Shuchi's Snow Imprint at the Orchid Pavilion</h3>
<p>In the middle of the month, I went to Hangzhou on business. After finishing, I returned to Yong. En route, I passed through Kuaiji and was firmly invited by my colleagues Zhang Gengxin, Gao Kan, and Tang Minhe (the three gentlemen are in charge of maritime administration in Shaoxing) to visit the Orchid Pavilion. I, too, thought the opportunity would not come again and agreed. This visit was truly gratifying, so I hastily recorded it to serve as a "snow imprint."</p>
<p>Orchid Pavilion Itinerary The Orchid Pavilion belongs to Shanyin County and is about twenty li from Kuaiji. Visitors cannot reach it directly. They must first travel by boat to Lou Palace, disembark, and take a rickshaw or a small donkey along the Shanyin Road for about half an hour to reach the Orchid Pavilion (approximately fifteen li by water and eight li by land).</p>
<p>Boating on Mirror Lake After learning about the Orchid Pavilion itinerary, we hired a boat and sailed along Mirror Lake. I initially thought Mirror Lake was round like West Lake, but it is actually a narrow, long river channel. Because its source comes from East Lake, it is named "Lake" after the river. The scenery along the river is pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>Sightseeing in Shanyin Upon arriving at Lou Palace, we abandoned the boat and disembarked. Some rode donkeys, others took rickshaws, each according to their preference. I rode a small donkey, acting as a "vanguard," strolling along Shanyin Road, admiring the scenery. I saw towering mountains, verdant forests, and tall bamboo trees on the banks, all vividly in sight. The ancient saying that on Shanyin Road, one's eyes are overwhelmed, is truly true. After nine o'clock, we arrived at the Orchid Pavilion. A stream of water blocked the vehicle, and the driver carried me across the water before we finally reached our destination.</p>
<p>Photography at the Orchid Pavilion After arriving at the Orchid Pavilion, just a few steps inside the entrance, there was the Wenchang Pavilion, a magnificent and impressive building. On the wall was a stele commemorating those who donated to repair the Orchid Pavilion, totaling more than 24,000 yuan. Among them, a certain cloth merchant donated 10,000 yuan alone, showing his generosity. Outside the pavilion, there was the Goose Pond Pavilion, lined with winding paths and flowing water, making gurgling sounds. Ancient trees towered, and pine and bamboo formed a forest. Further ahead, there were two pavilions and a residence. The one in the middle was the Flowing Goblet Pavilion, but the door was closed, and the interior was not visible. To the right stood a stele of the Orchid Pavilion, inscribed with the words "Orchid Pavilion," but regrettably, it was not the true calligraphy of Wang Xizhi. We, feeling that such a grand occasion was rare, took photographs here to commemorate it. At the Flowing Goblet Pavilion, we took another photo to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>Drinking Tea at the Ancestral Hall After taking the photos, we turned left and arrived at the residence gate, with the inscription "Wang Youjun Ancestral Hall." Inside the room was the Mohua Pavilion, with exquisite carvings on all four sides of the railing. On the walls of the two corridors were carved poems by famous people. I am suffering from illness. The azure sky is vast, but what am I to resent? Heaven has bestowed upon me countless misfortunes. Since the beginning of winter, I have been invaded three times by the two [i.e., illness and misfortune]. One night, leaning against the wall, groaning, hundreds of worries seethed within, and the ominous atmosphere gathered together, resulting in this chapter. I record it to the "Freedom Talk" as a lament. I will always seek life in my quilt and pillow. I will not bring homesickness into my dreams. If I were not weak, how could I endure the changes in the world? The weaving of fate should rest with the times. I pity my proud bones buried in the marketplace. I regret the fleeting years like flowing water. Endless sorrow and tears are exhausted. On my sickbed, I have no way to relieve my distress.</p>
<h3>A Laughing Matter: Hai Ke</h3>
<p>Mother (to her nine-year-old son): Child, child, come here, I have something to ask you. Son: Mother, what is it? Mother: Why did you hurt your younger brother and make him cry? Son: We were playing a game of driving a car. I was the driver, and I assigned him to be the horn of the car. Doesn't the horn need to be squeezed to make a sound? A: This little river is the memento of my life, the most painful memento. B: Is there some story behind it?</p>
<p>A: How could there not be? For ten years, I have lost my freedom and suffered endless pain, all originating from this hateful little river.</p>
<p>B: What happened?</p>
<p>A: Ten years ago, I saved a woman who accidentally fell into the water here. She was so grateful that she insisted on marrying me, and we got married then.</p>
<p>A young man (walks into a splendid Western restaurant and asks a neatly uniformed waiter): Do you have any empty seats here tonight?</p>
<p>Waiter: There are many empty seats because today is not Saturday or Sunday. Business is relatively slow, and our meal prices are particularly high. Young man: But do you think the seats will be full around eight o'clock tonight? Waiter: I don't think there will be a full house tonight. Young man: Then I'll give you a dollar. Waiter: Sir, thank you. Do you want me to reserve a seat for you? Young man: No, there are three female guests who have asked me to accompany them to dinner here at eight o'clock tonight. At that time, please tell them (I'm sorry, all the seats are reserved tonight).</p>
<p>The dazzling array of things to see and hear was immensely beneficial. What I loved to recite most was Xu Shuming's poem: (The land where forty-two worthies raised their goblets, I visit after more than a thousand years. The steep cliffs have not changed the color of the pine and bamboo, the pavilions and villas first embrace the water and rocks of autumn. The administration is beautiful and leisurely, preserving the old traces. Sitting here without worldly thoughts, famous figures gather. I only pity the snow claws left as inscriptions, my guestly interest exhausted, visiting Dai An'dao in Shanyin by boat.) Walking along the corridor to the main residence, I saw a shrine in the middle with the inscription "Spiritual Seat of the Marquis Wang Youjun General Yi Shao of the Jin Dynasty." I admired the former sages and paid my respects. Inside the residence, tea was sold to provide guests with a place to rest. We sipped tea there, admiring the楹聯all around, too beautiful to take in. I briefly recorded one or two to share: (Ascending to this scenic spot, since the Eastern Jin Dynasty, how many times have the palaces been moved and changed? All the wise men have arrived here, asking Wang Youjun, and then the flowing goblet is used as a preface, but who else? ) (The wind and moon are clear and bright, the flowing water and goblets evoke the past, the spring and autumn are full of good days, and the towering mountains and mountains admire the former sages.) (This place seems to be revisited, thinking of the scene of the flowing goblets in those years, there was never a lack of my immortal fate. It is difficult to predict the reverse, ask when I will come again to repair the wedge, can I meet you?)</p>
<p>Discussing the Stele at the Royal Pavilion After leaving the ancestral hall, we arrived at the Royal Stele Pavilion, where a stele stood tall, as high as the roof. The "Orchid Pavilion Preface" was engraved on the front, and Qianlong's poem was engraved on the back. The calligraphy was strong and beautiful, and the poem was full of flavor. Reading it, I couldn't help but let my mind wander. It was a pity that there was no rubbing to give to my friends.</p>
<h3>Smiling Yan, an Overseas Chinese from Taiwan Who Loves the Country and Hometown</h3>
<p>Taiwan was originally a shield for our country. It was ceded during the Jiawu year. After the Japanese worked hard to develop its economy, it has become a world-renowned area. Most of the Chinese who live in Taiwan are from Fujian and Guangdong, and they all reside in Taipei, Taichung, and Tainan. I have traveled there in the past and have met with many overseas Chinese. Therefore, I know that the overseas Chinese are extremely enthusiastic about loving the country and hometown. Xie Yanying and Cai Xianming are sufficient proof. I record their associations to see a glimpse of the situation of the overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Xie Yanying Welcomes Investigators from the National Government The National Government used to believe that there were many overseas Chinese in Taiwan, so it planned to establish a consulate in Taiwan to handle overseas Chinese affairs. Recently, it sent investigators Yuan Jiada and Lin Wucun to Taiwan to inspect everything. When Yuan and Lin arrived in Taipei, Xie Yanying and Jiang Weichuan, members of the Taipei Chamber of Commerce, sought to establish a consulate as soon as possible and to state the situation of the overseas Chinese. Therefore, they held a banquet at Penglai Pavilion to welcome Yuan and Lin. During the banquet, Jiang stated the oppression of the overseas Chinese and reported the significance of the overseas Chinese organizing the General Chamber of Commerce, hoping that Yuan and Lin would promote the realization of the National Government's plan to establish a consulate after their investigation and return to the country. In addition, they also discussed the pharmaceutical industry and other businesses. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed.</p>
<p>Cai Xianming Returns to Quanzhou to Run Industry Cai Xianming, an overseas Chinese from Quanzhou in Taiwan, is charitable, generous, and has lofty ambitions. He has been operating the Hailu Products Chamber of Commerce Lianchun, and then founded the Cai Fengmao Company, specializing in Quanzhou's most valuable Buddha King Tea, with excellent results. In recent years, Mr. Cai has repeatedly wanted to return to China to run industry, but unfortunately, it has not been easy to achieve due to the wars and bandit disasters in the mainland. However, Mr. Cai has always been unable to restrain himself from witnessing the economic development of Taiwan. He heard that the domestic wars have subsided and the bandit atmosphere has gradually subsided. Therefore, he plans to take huge sums of money back to Quanzhou to strive to revitalize our country's industry.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Xie and Mr. Cai are living in different places and running businesses, they are both devoted to the country and their hometown, and they never forget. Mr. Xie and Mr. Cai will surely create a different splendor in the overseas Chinese community in the future.</p>
<h3>Literary Tiger's Small Talk: Xue Yunbai</h3>
<p>Literary tiger, also known as lantern riddles, is a kind of game for scholars, and frequent practice can enlighten the mind and increase knowledge. I have recently become addicted to this, and I often prepare it to help me have fun when I have small talks with my peers. However, the answers to the riddles are all based on Peking opera, market signs, personal names, movies, etc., in order to be popular. Now I record some of the ones I can remember that I have made myself, and I will laugh with the readers. I will slowly say more later. Market sign one (Xu Chongdao) Dominating the world Contemporary person drops his tail (Xu Shiying) Sun and moon Market sign one (Kaiming) Waking up to urinate once or twice Peking opera one Jiao Xin (Su San Starts Imprisonment) Nanshi Zhao One (East Asia) Mount Tai is overhead Peking Opera One (Yue Jia Zhuang) Small gift Domestic film one Rolling curtain (Little Lover) The new name for the quiet one (reactionary) A strong domestic film (Unbearable to look back) Uncle Huang still bows when he leaves Foreigner one (Liu Bieqian) A small room can only accommodate one person Slang One (Don't Live There) A mansion A Shanghai prostitute (Senior) The artist One (Wang Yifei) The national treasure of the Qing Dynasty Market Sign One (Longquan) Suspecting that a woman is not chaste Foreign Film One (Infatuated Woman) Rich Merchant Star One (Tang Jie) The way to be beautiful Peking opera one (Hua Rong Dao) Thirty-four three-character classic sentence (Twenty-seven) Can recognize the way Novelist Two Go Surname (Da Kemingdao) Sleeping soundly Novelist Two Go Surname (Mian Yuntianxiao) Jia Chen got the world Star One Downstairs (Wang Yuanlong) Morning Star One (Dawn Wei) Unique Crane Market Sign One (Dual Dragon)</p>
<p>News from the arts and crafts world: The Wumen Youth Association will hold an exhibition of more than 100 works by the famous painter Tao Lengyue at its building starting on New Year's Day, and will donate a portion of the proceeds from the painting exhibition to the Winter Relief Association initiated by Zhang Shenlao. Last winter, Mr. Lengyue accepted an invitation to lecture on fine arts at Zhongshan University in Henan and traveled to Kaifeng. Among the products this time, such as (Moon over Guanshan), are realistic scenes of Hulaoguan; (Moonlight on the Yellow River) also records the scenic spots and historical sites in the Yellow River. Famous paintings complement each other, and there will surely be a grand occasion at that time (Shi Yi)</p>
<p>Correction: In the manuscript (Remembering the Three Friends of Hangzhou in the Cold Season) published on the 21st of this month, the author is Mr. Song Lu, but the printer mistakenly planted Huang Lu as a whole for correction.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes to Southeast Asia (113) Spiritual Flower</h3>
<p>On the twenty-first, I went out and saw what is called the Ancient City Hall, which is a joint group of the Guan, Zhang, and Zhao surnames. I have seen it in various places in Singapore, Penang, and Yangon. The scale is also small and methodical. It is a method of combining groups overseas. If the world is not unified one day, then the family cannot be abolished. I heard that there are also such things in the Americas. China has been a world of families since Yu, that is, the system of Tang, Yu, Yao, and Shun's abdication still borrows the power of female rule. The power of the clan cannot be underestimated. This is the organization of Plato's ideal country that emphasizes blood marriage? On this day, various groups held farewell parties, and Japanese women also came. On the afternoon of the twenty-second, I returned south to Yangon from Mandalay. I had already agreed with everyone not to send me off again. However, when the time came, in addition to the middlemen, there were also Burmese Keha who came to the station. In the carriage, I met a Burmese official who was lying in the second-class compartment and talked briefly. It was also a fever. On the morning of the twenty-third, I arrived in Yangon. From then on, I was sick for seventeen days. As expected, people said that those who travel to northern Burma must get a minor illness. I stayed in a room and pulled away what I saw and felt in the diary.</p>
<p>I live in the Anxi Guild Hall, a five-story building. Outside the building, I overlook the Yangon River. There are often small red crows, about half the size of a crow, and they often avoid the crows. The red crows chase them. All the crows run away. The small red crows sometimes sharpen their beaks with the stones on their heads, which is extremely lively. It is incomprehensible to chase the big with the small. Is it because the small ones are smart and the big ones are stupid? However, I often saw crows chasing big eagles in Nanjing. They also avoided them from afar. I often asked my friends about it. My friends also said that they often saw it. The physics of mutual victory does not necessarily mean that the big ones control the small ones. The small ones can also control the big ones. The red crows can control the crows, and the crows can distinguish the big eagles, while the big eagles can control snakes. People often say that when an eagle is in the air, it sees a snake crawling on the ground and suddenly dives down to strike its head and eat it like eating noodles. Burmese people's knowledge is gradually increasing, so Chinese business is becoming more and more prosperous. The Chinese do not have the science to develop big business, but only make profits from petty sales. They used to take advantage of the ignorance of the people of Southeast Asia, but now it is not possible. In the past, the Burmese were honest and did not know how to bargain. They paid whatever the Chinese wanted, but now they do not. In the past, the Mongolian merchants told me</p>
<p>Chinese businessmen in Mongolia are also not very moral. They often use tea to exchange for sheep, often taking advantage of their lack of numeracy to deceive them. These are all the weaknesses of the Chinese, and they should be greatly motivated. I hope that the knowledge class in Southeast Asia will guide them well.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (3) (4) (5) Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter 16: Cui Xiu diligently asks Mr. Zi for words, generously discusses military affairs, and Qinglou banquet Female Hero Zuo Shichen said, "What kind of great, middle, and small people are you talking about after making so much noise? Why don't you just say it frankly and keep it in your stomach to make people sad?" Sun Qilei said, "Let me tell you the truth, it's not about any great, middle, or small people. She is a great female person. Her name is Ren Peizhen. You should know her famous name, right?" Zuo Shichen said, "How can I not know Ren Peizhen's famous name? Has she arrived in Shanghai? Moreover, you met her in a hall. This can be regarded as a rare event. How could that owner have invited her? Is she a lady also happy to come to that corrupt hall in Shanghai?" Sun Qilei said, "Although she is a woman, she can be regarded as a heroine, completely shedding the usual powdery air. She said that women have always been considered to be observing etiquette if they don't step out of the boudoir, so women are like prisoners in a jail. This is all the tyranny of men, so women will never see the light of day. Like that Ms. Ren, she said that she doesn't care where she goes. Don't say the halls of Shanghai, even if it's a place that is more sordid and filthy than the halls of Shanghai, she is willing to go when invited. Buddha said, 'If I don't go to hell, who will?' This is just a tool to bind people. Now, women want to revolt, and they want to get rid of that bad habit. She still has many anecdotes from the revolutionary era to tell. Unfortunately, I came here and didn't listen to it." Long Ziyun said, "Ren Peizhen can be regarded as a contemporary heroine. It's a pity that we don't know her. It would be very interesting to talk to her." Ling Zhixiang said, "Let's invite her here. I don't know if she will be willing to come." Just now, Mr. Sun Qilei was talking to her with great interest. We use</p>
<p>In Mr. Sun's name, she will definitely be willing to come. Sun Qilei said, "That's not necessary. Because you just came to urge the guests, wasn't Mr. Shichen's name written on the invitation card? She then asked me if this Shichen was Zuo Shichen. I then asked her if she knew him. She said she knew him and had seen this gentleman's famous name in the newspaper. Because you are in the same industry, she suspected that it was him. When will you also introduce her to meet him? So, at this moment, it is an opportunity for Brother Shichen to become famous and invite her. She will definitely be willing to come." Everyone then encouraged Zuo Shichen to invite her to come and talk, so that we can open our eyes and know why a great woman is a great woman, and so that we can listen to her great opinions. Zuo Shichen laughed and said, "You are all too happy. However, I have never met this Ms. Ren Peizhen, so it can be regarded as a chance encounter. It is difficult to say whether she will be willing to come. Let's try it for now. It's not a formal invitation, and it's also in this hall, so isn't it a bit embarrassing to be engaged in it?"</p>

<h3>The Financial Gold Market Has Not Changed Much</h3>
<p>There was no large amount of trading, and the results were healthy. A major review of the gold market situation last week showed that although there were no major changes, the waves were not small.

However, due to the two-day holiday of the Yadan Festival, the market only traded for four days.

<h3>Securities Last Week's Bond Market Increasingly Desolate</h3>
<p>The entire week's transaction volume was only over 28.1 million yuan. The market was dull, with minimal fluctuations and a slight increase compared to the previous week. Within the past week, the Shanghai Securities Exchange's public bond market had a spot trading volume of only 118,200 yuan. Among these, the 1929 Customs Loan accounted for 42,200 yuan, the Disbandment Loan for 20,000 yuan, the Reorganization Loan for 17,000 yuan, and the 1936 and 1937 loans each for about 10,000 yuan. All other loans only had several thousand yuan in transactions. The futures market was in the period of national lunar new year closing accounts and the bond market environment had no change. As a result, major market players were watching and trading was sparse, making the market even more desolate than before. It was found that apart from Wednesday's transaction volume of 8.4 million yuan being relatively active, the remaining days were quiet. Friday was particularly desolate, with daily trading volume only around 900,000 yuan. The quietness of the market was unprecedented in recent years.

There were still no transactions for the Continued Second Fifth Loan and the Continued Consolidated Loan.

It was found that the highest and lowest price difference for each bond throughout the week, except for the 1929 Customs Loan and the 1929 Rehabilitation Loan exceeding one yuan, mostly fluctuated around five or six jiao, with the number of increases slightly exceeding the number of decreases, but the difference was also small. Also, the December futures market for the past week was closed from Friday to prepare for delivery, and the February futures market only traded on the weekend. The statistics of the highest, lowest, rise and fall of each bond price in the past week are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Last Week's Yarn Market Showed a Sharp Rise</h3>
<p>Due to factory tax concerns, spot sales suddenly surged. The yarn market experienced a sharp rise last week, with a firm trend, mainly due to the implementation of the factory tax on January 1st. As a result, spot sales from various merchant groups increased, and spot yarn purchases were particularly strong. Customers from all regions showed enthusiasm, and market sentiment was positive. Before the factory tax was implemented, goods transported to the location could be exempt from taxes amounting to six or seven taels of silver. Therefore, spot yarn business flourished. Moreover, due to the low base price, any positive news led to a more pronounced upward trend. Although the Chaozhou merchant group and Japanese traders sold off some goods, the market was too impulsive. Outside investors competed to buy, making it difficult to resist the momentum. Customer groups from Sichuan, inland areas, and Guangdong were the most active buyers. It was found that various merchant groups purchased approximately 30,000 to 40,000 bales of spot yarn this week, resulting in this large sales volume. The stock of goods in Shanghai decreased, making it difficult to adjust. However, the stock of goods in various external locations increased, and the upward trend in marked yarn became more intense. Prices for all months were more than three taels higher than the previous week. Due to the year-end holidays, most retailers did not want to trade rashly in the five days during which the market might fluctuate drastically. Both buyers and sellers wanted to settle their accounts before the new year. As a result, the upward trend was unstoppable, and the accounting was not completed until 7:30 PM, indicating the high level of trading activity. If spot sales can continue steadily after the Lunar New Year, there will be potential for further price increases in the yarn market. Conversely, significant changes are also possible. The price of spot yarn and Japanese yarn rose three to four taels.</p>
<h3>Last Week's Hankou Standard Cotton Squeezed Higher</h3>
<p>Recently reached a high of thirty-five taels. There have been no significant changes in the overseas cotton market over the past week. However, the local cotton market experienced a sharp price increase, with buyers squeezing the December contract, which rose by two taels. This situation arose because the supply of Hankou cotton was disrupted, and the inventory was not substantial. Standard grades were top-notch, and the market lacked spot goods. Generally, short sellers were bearish due to the weak global situation, while buyers squeezed the market due to the shortage of goods. As a result, most of those who sold short were retail investors. The last few days of the month coincided with the Christmas holiday, during which warehouses were closed and samples could not be inspected. This intensified the squeeze, and prices reached a high of thirty-five taels, exceeding the spot cotton price by more than two taels. This scenario was rare in recent times. After the squeeze last month, retail short sellers were generally fearful. Therefore, although US cotton prices fell on the weekend, the market was closed due to the year-end holiday.</p>
<p>Daytime increases of four or five qian each, but the spot demand of various factories stagnated, lacking vitality. Prices for all months of standard cotton were eight or nine qian higher than the previous week. US cotton prices remained flat. The cotton market is difficult to predict in the short term due to disrupted supply.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton buyers decreased, and the market weakened. It initially fell due to the weakness on Wall Street, but later rebounded slightly due to some short covering. Futures fell by one to three points, while spot prices remained unchanged. British cotton was closed. The Indian cotton market was firm. The near-term and far-term prices of Pingguo fell by one, Aomula fell by one, the far-term prices of Bairoxi fell by two, and Bairoxi fell by one robbie. (Report from the 27th)</p>
<p>US Cotton Compared to Previous Day, Consistent with Shen Regulations</p>

<h3>Grains Rice Market Slightly Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the number of ships arriving at Zhabei was still scarce, only around ten. The waterways were still not clear, so buyers inevitably stockpiled a bit as the end of the year approached. Therefore, market transactions were active. There was not much fluctuation in the price of high-quality northern japonica rice. The price of top-grade special rice remained between thirteen yuan and seventy or eighty jiao. Sales of low-quality rice were flat. However, the market was active due to the scarcity of goods. The nearby jiao yang rice had decent sales. The market price of the tip of the rice was slightly increased. However, the prices of superior rice and top-quality rice remained sluggish and there were few transactions. However, the situation was still promising, and prices turned negative. Sales were evenly matched, and the market lacked high-quality goods, so prices did not increase or decrease. Ordinary high-quality rice opened at around thirteen yuan. Yesterday, more than ten ships arrived in South Shanghai. The sales market on this street was initially sluggish but later became active. Northern japonica rice had initially been shorted, but the buying interest strengthened as the market in North Shanghai turned firm, causing prices to rise. The top-quality japonica rice from Changbang was slightly tight. The trend of southern rice was stable. Sales of rice tips were decent. Firm prices turned negative. Because it was Sunday, sales were weak. Currently, the price difference is close to the price of rice husk, and interest from all parties is flat.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Japanese Sugar Suddenly Surged</h3>
<p>New tariff rules have been announced, and spot raw sugar continues to open at 10,000 bags. Yesterday, the sugar market production area reported that because it was Sunday, there was no arrival. The association market marked the price. With the new tariff rules about to be implemented, there was news that the order would be announced soon. Tax bureaus everywhere are also actively carrying out their duties. Therefore, various inland firms wanted to ship sugar goods within the year, resulting in a sudden surge in market sentiment and high demand. The market rose two qian again. However, Dutch sugar No. 24 raw white sugar opened with strength and the trend was relatively flat. The initial price was eight taels and nine qian, and the later price was nine taels, and the market was still firm. No. 20 medium white sugar was eight taels and five qian, and No. 8 Dutch red sugar was seven taels and nine qian, and the market was also not weak. The inventory of Japanese sugar was not high and demand was still strong. N mark price rose to nine taels, four qian and seven and a half fen. YT mark was nine taels and three qian to nine taels and three and a half qian. YP mark was nine taels and eight qian. Meiji goods were nine taels and eight and a half qian. YM mark was eight taels and nine qian to J mark was ten taels to ten taels and one qian. The market situation was very strong and still had the potential to rise. Maocheng Firm sold 100 bags of No. 1 crystal sugar, and the price rose eight taels and one qian. Shanghai Factory sold a small amount of this factory's crystal sugar and the market rose another step, priced at eleven taels and seven qian for the Ren character and eleven taels and six qian for the Qian character. Zhenxiang Firm opened 2,000 bags of present net raw white sugar at a price of eight taels and nine and a half qian. Huaxin Firm also sold opened 5,000 bags at the same price. Jinfang Firm also opened 1,863 bags at a price of nine taels, and the goods were also higher in quality and the market situation was also very promising.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Last Week's Silk Market Gradually Became Active</h3>
<p>China Electric News reported market price inquiries. London was preparing to handle futures silk. Overseas prices were reported to have increased, but manufacturers still had to lose money.</p>
<p>Although the Shanghai foreign merchant silk market was in the Christmas holiday during the second half of last week and was closed for three days as usual, the factory direct negotiations market was still not deserted, and overseas silk sales gradually became active. At the beginning of the week, New York sent a telegram inquiring about the factory direct market price, and London had already sent a telegram regarding transactions. Because foreign firms were closed for three days due to the Christmas holiday, it was hoped that there would be more than one hundred bales of factory direct transactions on Monday (today). European and American silk merchants were taking the opportunity to purchase raw materials for spring silk because they believed that factory direct prices had fallen to the lowest level. Silk in the hands of speculators in the New York and London raw silk markets had already been sold off considerably. The factory direct price had already increased during the first three days of the week, several tens of taels. Unfortunately, since the beginning of winter, silk prices had plummeted. Although the price of silk had turned up in response to the news, manufacturers still had to lose money. (The overseas purchase price for grade B factory direct silk was only 800 taels, while the cost to the factory was more than 900 taels.) The future of the silk market remained difficult to predict. Last week, spot silk exports consisted of more than 500 bales shipped by American firms to American territory. Due to the fact that the shipping companies had agreed to reduce the freight costs for Chinese silk to Europe by six or seven taels per piece (to take effect on the first of next month), exports to England and France had all been postponed. Although the overseas price of Chinese silk had repeatedly increased during the past week, it was still difficult to recover to the market price at the beginning of last month because the drop in the middle of the month was relatively sharp. The current silk prices in New York and Lyon are listed below (New York prices per pound, unit: US dollars; Lyon prices per kilo, unit: francs):</p>
<p>Silk Type New York Lyon Silk Type New York Lyon</p>
<p>Superior Shanghai Silk 2.75 288 Superior Clean Silk 2.00 175</p>
<p>Superior Shanghai Silk 2.10 247 Medium Clean Silk 1.50 129</p>
<p>Medium Shanghai Silk 1.95 203 Inferior Clean Silk 1.15 095</p>
<p>Inferior Shanghai Silk 1.55 158 Superior Large Silk 1.70 138</p>

<p>Superior Gray Silk 1.75 128</p>
<h3>Tin Yesterday's Transaction Volume was 600 Loads</h3>
<p>The tin trade has been going smoothly in the run-up to the end of the year. Although yesterday was Sunday, the transaction volume was still more than 600 loads. The most purchases came from the Sichuan merchant group. The tin from Hankou and Shaoxing was also widely distributed. The market price was quite attractive due to the low volume of goods and the weak exchange rate. The prices were estimated to be 107 taels for Fuzu tin, 106 taels for Dutch tin, 94 and a half taels for small tin, and 92 to 93 taels for miscellaneous tin.</p>

<h3>Book and Newspaper Introductions</h3>
<p>The Economic Development History of Modern China, by Tang Binhou and Hou Houpei: Although our country is based on agriculture, due to the constraints of unequal treaties, the power of foreign economies is constantly invading. Therefore, all kinds of industries lag behind other countries. Speaking of such things, it is really heartbreaking. Because as long as the rope of economy is wrapped around our country, all other foreign invasions will be enough to make everything in our country fall into depression and backwardness. Of course, we cannot bear to see our country continue like this forever. The responsibility for making the economic strength of our country develop is one that all patriotic people with integrity should deeply bear. This inevitably requires the most basic research on major issues related to the country and economic development. In fact, under such circumstances in our country, there is no economic development to speak of. However, since the late Qing Dynasty, the economic sector can also be said to have made considerable progress. This is an undeniable fact. However, no scholars have collected this material, and no scholars have deeply explored this most basic and important issue belonging to our country. This is the biggest defect we consider. However, the publication of Mr. Hou's book has completely made up for this defect that we consider to be the biggest.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into eight chapters. Chapter 1 (Changes in Population) accurately estimates the area of our country's land. In order to make it clear to the reader, it describes all the provinces of China in detail. The area of our country's borders, such as Qinghai and Tibet, is also estimated by the author on the basis of evidence, citing estimates made by foreigners and comparing them with our country's measurements in order to understand the truth. This is enough to show the expertise of this book. After the area of the land is understood, the next urgent thing to understand is the population statistics. The author traces these statistics back to the Three Dynasties, based on the records in the Wenxian Tongkao and the Twenty-Four Histories, combined with the most recent accurate surveys for comparative research, and details the shortcomings of the statistics and their inaccurate totals in order to understand the truth. The result of this research will of course be a more accurate statistic. Based on the total population of each province and the calculation of the land area of each province, the population density is calculated. The author provides a very detailed table that allows us to understand which provinces have a high population density and which provinces are distributed too unevenly. This deep impression can be obtained by looking at the table exemplified by the author. The state of population movement is also extremely important. This state can be divided into two types: immigration and emigration. This is related to the territory of one's own country, the situation of overseas Chinese, and various international issues. Therefore, the author describes this section in particular detail and includes tables to awaken the reader's reading. This is really worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 is (The Situation of Agriculture). Our country is an agricultural country, so the most important industry is of course agriculture. This has been in our country for more than 5,000 years, so this situation should be given more attention. In the beginning, the author accurately statistically analyzes the area of farmland and the number of cultivated land acres in past dynasties, and the most recent ones are based on the reports made by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce in various provinces and districts, and describes them by province, which is particularly difficult. The next thing is to elaborate on the number of farm households, the changes in the tenant farming system, and the situation of major agricultural products in detail. Especially in the last section, the amount of production in various places, such as rice, etc., is mostly compared by means of tables. Chapter 3 is the progress of mechanical industry, because our country's industry is in an extremely young age. However, in recent years, under the economic invasion of the great powers, people across the country have realized that it is not enough to survive without revitalizing industry, and active promotion will of course make considerable progress. Therefore, this chapter is also extremely important in the whole book. The author first describes the origin of industrial development, and then describes the rise, progress, and development of industries such as cotton weaving, woolen weaving, flour, steel, cement, and chemical industries in detail and without omission.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 is (The Improvement of the Currency System), which is divided into six sections: (1) Our Country's Currency System in the Past; (2) The Motivation for the Improvement of the Currency System in the Late Qing Dynasty; (3) The Era of the Gold Exchange Standard Proposal; (4) Wei Shilin's Proposal for Currency System Reform; (5) The Achievements of the Currency System Committee in the Early Years of the Republic of China; (6) Recent Measures to Rectify the Currency System. Chapter 5 is (The Development of Modern Banks), which is divided into four sections: (1) The Changes in the Central Bank System; (2) The System of Local Banks; (3) The Development of Domestic Banks; (4) The Power of Foreign Banks in China. Chapter 6 is (The Development of International Trade), which is divided into seven sections: (1) International Trade Before Trade; (2) The Loss of Trade Rights After Trade; (3) The Trend of International Trade in the Last Sixty-Four Years; (4) An Analysis of Import Trade; (5) An Analysis of Export Trade; (6) An Analysis by Trading Country; (7) The Situation of Customs Revenue. Chapter 7 is (The Progress of Modern Transportation), which is divided into four sections: (1) The Development of Railways; (2) The Development of Telecommunications; (3) The Development of Postal Services; (4) The Situation of Shipping. Chapter 8 is (The Modern Labor Movement in China), which is divided into five sections: (1) The Source of Modern Labor Problems; (2) The Labor System in China; (3) The Number and Living Conditions of Laborers; (4) The Organization of Labor Groups; (5) Labor-Capital Disputes. Each section has its own unique point of view, and the examples are particularly rare in other books.</p>
<p>After reading this book, we can understand the whole meaning of the economic development history of modern China. In our country with backward economy, the publication of this book has great value and is by no means comparable to any trivial economic history. This is enough to show the value of this book.</p>
<h3>The World Agricultural Situation, by Nan Xin</h3>
<p>Edited by Wu Juenong: Anyone can understand that our country has been engaged in agriculture since the beginning of history. It is a colonial industry that artificially produces the animal and plant substances necessary for human beings. Of course, agriculture is not limited to the cultivation of farmland. In fact, no matter what era, in addition to cultivating plant production, most of them also engage in animal production such as breeding, fishing, and hunting. Therefore, when we talk about agriculture, in a narrow sense, it only refers to cultivating plants, but in a broad sense, all undertakings such as cultivation, afforestation, animal husbandry, and aquaculture belong to the scope of agricultural production.</p>
<p>Since the objects of agriculture are all living things, the growth and reproduction of which are subject to extremely important natural conditions, it is inevitable that the mode of operation will be subject to natural conditions everywhere. Although the mining of inanimate matter, the processing and manufacturing of industry, and the circulation of commerce are also directly or indirectly affected by natural conditions, these are not as obvious as agriculture. In this way, it is certainly not easy to engage in agriculture in a fundamental way. However, since we are a country established on agriculture, we should have a clear understanding of all kinds of common sense in agriculture, and further research is of course necessary. This is of great importance to the development of China's resources. If a country established on agriculture has agricultural products that are less developed than a country based on industry, how ashamed is this? Therefore, Mr. Wu's book (The World Agricultural Situation) is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>To study agriculture, we must of course explore several important points in agriculture, such as climate, land, machinery, and management. Mr. Wu's book also pays attention to these important issues. In the first chapter's discussion, the first thing is to explain the characteristics of agriculture, the area of agricultural land, the output of crops, and the international trade of crops. The author's description of China is particularly</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>detailed, while for other countries in the world, he lists tables for comparison, such as (Table of Agricultural Land Area in Various Countries in the World), common production (including wheat, rye, corn, potatoes, etc.) area crop cultivation by category table), (table of crop cultivation area of ​​various countries), (table of major crop production in the world), (table of export volume of major crops in the world and major continents), etc. These are important reference materials for agricultural research. The editor has collected them in extremely detail, which is not easy to see in other books of this kind. However, such comparative research can make us understand the advantages and disadvantages of agricultural products in that country, and it can also serve as a lesson for our own country to work hard. Under the foreign economic invasion, this issue has a major relationship with the entire country. The responsibility for agricultural improvement should be borne by scholars in general.</p>
<p>The survey of farmers' living conditions, the historical facts of the tenant farming system, and the process of land reform are all the most important issues in agriculture. For example, farmers are the most important members of society who provide human living materials. The evolution of the tenant farming system should be understood. Land is the foundation of human survival and the first element in managing agriculture. Needless to say, this is a major point in this undertaking. Dao This section is mentioned by the editor in the second chapter (Agricultural Policy).</p>
<p>The third chapter is about (Rice) (1) Overview of Cultivation (2) Social Conditions for Developing Rice (3) Rice Producing Countries (4) Production Status and Supply and Demand Relationship. We need to know that rice occupies a very important position in the world's food products. Therefore, this chapter is even more concise. The editor has also collected detailed information on this item, and has reviewed the rice produced in the area south of Harbin in the three northeastern provinces of China. This is really commendable. The fourth chapter is about (Wheat) (1) Overview of Cultivation (2) Wheat Producing Countries (3) Production and Supply and Demand. The fifth chapter is about (Cotton) (1) Overview of Cultivation (2) Cotton Producing Countries (3) Production and Supply and Demand. The sixth chapter is about (Silkworm Cocoons) (1) Overview (2) Sericulture Countries (3) Demand and Supply. The seventh chapter is about (Tea) (1) Overview (2) Tea Producing Countries (3) Tea Supply and Demand. The eighth chapter is about (Forestry) (1) Overview (2) Forest Products on Each Continent (3) Timber Consumption and Trade. The ninth chapter is about (Animal Husbandry) (1) Overview (2) Distribution of Livestock (3) Distribution of Poultry and Egg Trade. The tenth chapter is about (Aquaculture) (1) Overview (2) Production and Manufacturing (3) Demand and Supply. At the end of the book, there is a (World Arable Land Comparison Map), which is particularly valuable.</p>
<p>Just by looking at the above, you can understand the abundance and detail of the content. Moreover, the editor is completely holding a research attitude, and his only goal is how to develop the country's agriculture. He is definitely not exploring this issue with other effects like other authors. Therefore, even from one point, we can see the great value of this book. There is also something that we find very heartbreaking, that is, a country established on agriculture does not conduct in-depth research on agricultural issues at all. That is to say, there are very few books of this kind, and they are simply rare. Because of this, Mr. Wu's book has opened a precedent for basic research on this undertaking, and we should also pay attention to this book. Therefore, the recommendation of this book to readers has great significance, at least that's what I think myself.</p>

<h3>Wuben Normal School's Third Grade Visits Huangdu Township Normal School's Affiliated Elementary School</h3>
<p>The third grade of the normal school of our Wuben High School has an elementary school practice course this semester. In addition to running a civilian school on campus to give the nearby civilians a chance to study, we also practice the teaching methods we teach under the guidance of teachers. In addition, we often go out to visit various elementary schools, such as Wanzhu, Xicheng, Shangzhong, and Shixiao. We have almost visited them all, and all the situations and facilities in their schools are still in our minds and notebooks. We deeply appreciate that so much practical knowledge has given us a model to observe.</p>
<p>However, these are all the general conditions of elementary schools in the city. Some students seem to still not feel satisfied and want to expand the scope of the visit and see what the elementary school facilities in the countryside are like. Therefore, they automatically asked the school to allow us to visit the elementary schools in the countryside. The result of the request was indeed successful. It was decided to visit the affiliated elementary school of Shangzhong Township Normal School on the 5th. That day, we got up very early. This is because the campus of Shangzhong Township Normal School is in Huangdu, and we have to take the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway train. Because of the long journey, we decided to come back the same day, so we had to get up early and take the first train to set off. At 6:30 in the morning, all 34 of our young ladies were ready and divided into</p>
<p>eight cars with teachers Zhong Shijie and Yao Zhibi. In the hazy morning light and strong wind, our eight cars flew like the wind to the North Railway Station and changed to a train straight to Huangdu. However, when we arrived at Huangdu, the campus of the Township Normal School was said to be more than six miles away from the station. Fortunately, we all wore straw sandals, which was naturally a novel outfit. So, although the muddy road after the rain was slippery and difficult to walk on, we wore straw sandals and had perseverance and patience. In the end, we quickly walked quickly to the Township Normal School. However, there were still three miles to the elementary school, so we mustered up our courage and continued to move forward, and in the end we walked to our destination. However, it was almost 11 o'clock, so we could only visit in this hasty hour. I didn't even see it clearly, which is a pity. The facilities of the affiliated elementary school of the Township Normal School are probably very complete. This is because I have not visited many affiliated elementary schools of the Township Normal School, so I cannot and dare not make a definite statement. Their classroom is the library, and using the library as a classroom can be regarded as the school's ability to make use of the school building and also facilitate teaching. This is very advisable. The arrangement in the classroom is orderly, the version is clean, and the light is sufficient, but the light that comes in from the square is inevitably a bit reflective. At that time, there were nine students in the class. Their clothes were not very gorgeous, but they were clean. Their spirits were lively and their physical movements showed a healthy beauty, which was really stronger than the children in the city. Their voices were high and clear, and their strong and healthy vocal cords were even more worthy of our joy. They did not show any strangeness to our group of people who came to visit. They seemed to be very calm while listening to the lecture, and they answered questions naturally. We had to admire the students' good training. However, due to the urging of time, we could not stay for a long time to observe in detail. We had to leave here and go south to visit their kindergarten.</p>
<p>The facilities in the kindergarten are very beautiful and there are many handicraft achievements of the children, and these achievements are mostly in line with the psychology of the children, or it can be said that they are all necessities that children play with in their daily life, such as clothes cut out and specimens of flowers, plants, and trees collected. However, one thing is worth noting. When we went to visit, we only saw four students, and these children were not as lively as those in the city and had shy expressions. When we went to see them, the teacher taught them to play games, but they were silent and did not move, so the teacher had to let them play freely. It is said that the number of children in this kindergarten was originally more than these few. This is because it rained yesterday, so only five people came today. On this point, the director of teaching affairs of the elementary school department and the director of the kindergarten said that the most difficult thing to run rural education is that there are too many student absences, such as rainy days, after rainy days, busy farming seasons, and family weddings and funerals, most of the children cannot go to school, especially on rainy days and after rainy days. This is really a difficult thing. The school has repeatedly thought of remedial methods and implemented some of them, such as going to the children's homes to talk to their families, talking about whether the curriculum is suitable for practical use, how the students do their homework at home, and telling them about the general situation in the school and future plans, and soliciting their opinions, and also talking about various issues of farming and local and national news. However, the effect is still minimal. Perhaps the biggest reason is the lack of rural economy. It is hoped that those who plan to popularize education will pay attention to this and jointly discuss remedial methods to break through this biggest difficulty in rural education.</p>
<p>In a hurry, we finally visited the elementary school and kindergarten. It was already 12 noon. We hurried back from the elementary school to the Township Normal School. This is because our lunch was prepared in the Normal School. We are not qualified to visit the Normal School, and we don't have the knowledge to criticize it. We can only ask the teachers of the school to give us some instructions. However, the teacher was very polite and wanted to lead us to visit the classrooms. After we saw them, we only felt satisfied. The cleanliness of their female dormitories and the excellent achievements in their achievement room are not my presumptuous criticism, but a kind of pleasure.</p>
<p>Later, we were grateful for the enthusiasm and kindness of the students of the school. They insisted on holding a welcome meeting to welcome us. We declined it again and again. We felt that we really didn't dare to accept it, but they insisted on being polite again and again, which made us feel that it was disrespectful to decline it and ashamed to accept it. But there was no way, so we had to accept their hospitality in shame. This was naturally a meaningful meeting. In this meeting, we heard the instructions of several teachers, and we also heard the students' false praise and encouragement. We were really grateful, and at the same time, we also gained a lot of wisdom.</p>
<p>When the twilight was dim and the sky presented a night bag, we returned to Huangdu Station. It was already 6 o'clock, but the train was delayed and had not arrived yet. We were all holding hands in the station, forming a big circle, and encircling the two teachers Yao and Zhong who led us in the middle, playing various games and telling interesting jokes. At this time, the cold wind was blowing fiercely, but we were all intoxicated in the joyful jokes. All we felt was happiness. Originally, it was already late when we came back, and in the middle, the train was delayed for more than an hour, so it took us almost the first watch to get to the school. It happened to be the time when the school was ringing the sleeping bell, and we were still having dinner. This can also be considered an interesting thing. In addition, what is worth reporting in this visit is the expansion of the school, which is part of their efforts to pursue the purpose of (integrating school education and family education). Therefore, the school's facilities should adapt to the environment and be able to attack the environment. The school's undertaking should develop outward so that the power of education can extend to the society. Therefore, the school and the family and the community must be as close and connected as possible. According to the report, the school has made the following facilities for this problem in the past three years. Let's write it out as the end of this article, and perhaps it can also provide a reference for those who run rural education.</p>
<p>(1) Rural hospital: This is for diagnosis and treatment of students, family members, and other villagers, and no fees are charged.</p>
<p>(2) Regular visits: The faculty and staff of the school often go to the homes of the students to talk to their families, talk about whether the curriculum is suitable for practical use, how the students do their homework at home, and tell them about the general situation in the school and future plans, and solicit their opinions. They also talk about various issues of farming and local and national news.</p>
<p>(3) Holding a celebration party: Hold one or two celebration parties every year to invite villagers to participate in entertainment together, so that they develop feelings for the school and generate faith.</p>
<p>(4) Farmers' Club: A special room is opened in the school to display various popular books and newspapers and entertainment equipment, etc., for villagers to read and guide them to do proper entertainment. (5) Others such as congratulatory receptions for happy events, assistance with village affairs, service to parents, parents' meetings, and mothers' and sisters' meetings, etc.</p>
<h3>Incoming Mail</h3>
<p>Respectfully imploring benevolent people from all walks of life to rescue Mr. Zhu Yi, the editor of the book, because he has suffered from all kinds of evil environmental obstacles and economic oppression, and his livelihood is in danger. I humbly request your office to quickly grant a rescue. I am currently 27 years old, from Jiangyin, and graduated from high school. I have served in politics as a clerk, inspector, and office worker for several years. The salary I received was still enough to barely maintain the livelihood of my family. I hoped that I could turn over and get out of the sea of ​​suffering from now on. Unexpectedly, my fate was ill-fated, and the political organs have recently been suspended and the staff has been completely dismissed. Since I suffered this major setback, everything has been restricted, and the losses have become more and more serious. I have suffered extremely profound stimulation. My economy is in distress, and I am alone and without relatives. No one is recommending me, and I am deeply aware of the pain in spirit and material. The society is cold, and there is no way to cry. Over the years, my grandmother and father have died tragically one after another due to illness and lack of medical treatment, resulting in a debt platform and high interest rates that cannot be repaid. Alas, how sad! Recalling the past, my ancestors and my father have been engaged in teaching and reading from generation to generation, and they do not know what business is. Therefore, they have no assets and have been poor for more than 30 years. The history has been declining, and there has not been a turning point for one day. I have been living a miserable and sad life in darkness. Every time I think of this, I feel so sad that I want to die. Now, I have suffered the unexpected disaster of unemployment, and I have been searching for a job everywhere, but I have not found one. I am at a loss and feel that the pain in my spirit and material is growing. The society is cold, and there is no way to cry. My family has been suffering from poverty for many years. Thinking of this, I am so sad that I want to die. Now, I have suffered the unexpected disaster of unemployment. I am constantly seeking a job, but I cannot find one. I am at a loss and feel that the pain in my spirit and material is growing. The society is cold, and there is no way to cry. My family of several people is starving and is in a dangerous situation. I have reached the end of the road and have fallen into the bottom of the sea forever without light and trapped in an irreversible desperate situation. I can only sigh and cry all day long, and I am worried that the time is already in the cold winter. Where can I go to call for help? Since I lost my job and suffered a painful trauma, I have become mentally disturbed and I want to commit suicide. However, I cannot bear to abandon my loving mother and young and weak sister and wife. If I want to survive, the environment is dangerous and the pressure is increasing, and there is no hope for livelihood. After thinking about it, it is all difficult. Looking at the clouds, I can only shed tears. Now is the autumn of crisis and survival. The timing is urgent and there is no time to lose. If I keep silent in danger, I have no choice but to beg the kind-hearted people from all walks of life to show mercy and to think of me in deep water and fire. I will take the spirit of mutual assistance among human beings and the compassion for the world and give me a solution in terms of morality. Give me a way out and introduce me to a position (with a guaranteed store) so that I can find a place to rest and indirectly extend the life of my family of several people. Your kindness is like a rebirth, and your great virtue will flow for thousands of generations. I will be 120,000 times grateful, and I will definitely continue to repay your kindness. Moreover, people are not made of wood or stone, how can they not be moved? If I am fortunate enough to have a job one day, I will definitely work hard and be loyal. In short, no matter what, I will not betray the kindness and good intentions of the rescuer. I can swear to the sky with my heart. I pray in the wind and cannot express everything in my heart. I humbly ask you to look into the matter and await your urgent orders (Note) (1) Occupational issues: I can serve in positions such as clerks, investigators, office workers, donation collectors, debt collectors, lease collectors, and inspectors in party, government, military, business, academic, and other fields, Chinese public and private institutions, banks, offices, and writing rooms. (2) Salary: At least 30 to 40 yuan per month is enough to cover the living expenses of a family. I do not want to be extravagant. (3) Address: Shanghai, Lao Laji Bridge, North Block, Nanshen Yuli, Kou (851 and a half), transferred</p>
