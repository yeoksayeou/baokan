<p>市訓練部爲雙十節</p>
<h3>檢閲告市童子軍書</h3>
<p>市訓練部爲十九年雙十節大檢閲告全市童子軍書云、我們在這萬衆歡　舉國若狂的國慶日的慶祝聲中、來舉行上海全市童子軍大檢閲是多麽使人快慰的一件事啊、吾人於此更不能不有所感想、我國因經濟之落後、萬事皆居人下、童子軍事業、也不能例外、較之歐美各國不禁使人自慚形　英國童子軍的創設、不過二十年全國數量、即逾六十萬、美國有童子軍的歷史、比英還遷三數年、而人數現在達八十萬以上、而我國的童子軍的情形又怎樣呢我國有童子軍的歷史差不多也近二十年、但統計起來全國的數目還不到五萬、同時在工作的表現、内部的組織、圑員的訓練、都遠不如歐美各國之進步這當然要歸咎童子軍自身之不努力、與領導者領導之不得法而經濟之　難、與其社會人士之袖手旁觀、也不無相當的綠故、所以我們要希望童子軍事業之發達、一方面要竭力打破經濟的難關、一方面要求社會人士之熱心贊助、而最主要的還在童子軍自身的努力、和領導者領導之得其法</p>
<p>自從第一次中國童子軍全國總檢閲以後、中國的童子軍事業、蓬蓬勃勃的氣象大有一日千里之勢、因爲在這一次的全國總檢閲當中、各地的童子軍的主持者、得到許多良好的指導、如組織的標準訓練的方針工作的進行、都得到一個正確的指示、組織上逐漸的嚴密與整齊起來了訓練上逐漸的统一與集中起來了而且不僅童子軍方面有了新的生機、即社會上對於童子軍應該要提倡應該要發展、也有了一個普遍的觀念、至於我們上海的情形、也是如此上海過去童子軍因爲没有領導機關、中心組織、以致意見紛歧各自爲謀童子軍事業、遂不易有長足的進展、自從中央有了童子軍統一組織以後各地童子軍才如江漢河淮之能各相統屬而彚流於海、自從大家參加了第一次全國總檢閲以後、便大家深深的覺到以前見解之錯誤、非趕快把各人的心力與意見統統貢獻給整個上海童子軍事業上面來不可、於是上海童子軍的景象、日由支離破碎的慘狀、漸達完整統一的境地各人的意見都消除了、無謂之争也没有了、所以上海童子軍有中心組織理事會便因之而産生、我們深信、自從這一個中心组織理事會産生之後、我們上海的童子軍事業、必更能蒸蒸日上的發展與進步、</p>
<p>童子軍事業的重要、在口頭上、無論什麽人都知道、而眞正認識童子軍的重要性的人、却未必多、這不但社會上的一般人是如此、就是童子軍自身、也免不了有歧誤之見、因爲童子軍雖有其世界性、但亦自有其民族性、此兩性之發展、必須保持其首尾相願之關係、換言之、對内必適應其國家民族的關係、對外必須適應其對世界人類的關係、民族地位、旣彼此各有所不相同、童子軍訓練也遂不能放棄其民族性之關係、在此中國民族猶處於被壓迫被侵略的時期、在此中國民族方在革命奮鬥的時期、爲民族核心的童子軍、其組織與訓練關係何等重要、是則非由與政府來領導、斷不足以適應整個民族之關係而貫澈其國民敎育上一貫的政策、我們記得蔣總司令在第一次總檢閲的時候、曾經有很許多可寶貴的話告訴我們、「二十世紀的人類應當個個都是社會人都是獨立人、人若孤立獨行、脱離社會、就不能維持他的生存、人若倚賴他人、寄生社會、也不能長久維持他的生存、能以自己的力量料理自己的生活、便是獨立、能盡自己的力量去替社會服務、便是社會人、所以童子軍的訓練的目標、便是要造成獨立人與社會人與資格、</p>
<p>蔣總司令又告訴我們「其中最生要的、便是圑結生活的精神、假如每一個童子軍的圑員若離開他的圑體、他便喪失他的作用、同時他的圑體也便减少一分力量、所以童子軍的圑體生活是有機性的、是異常緊密的、人類社會若能達到這種境界、是一定非常發達而進步的」把這兩段話連貫起來、我們便知三民主義的敎育宗旨、也可知童子軍的訓育方計了、是則童子軍與社會的關係是怎樣的密切、童子軍的使命是怎樣的重要、這兩段話的意思、把人類應該互助、應該圑結的眞義、閘發無遺、同時告訴我們童子軍應該爲人類的表率、爲人類的模範、所以我們説童子軍是民族的核心、人類的中堅份子、在國民訓育上是一個模範的組織、因爲中國國民、向如一盤散沙、如果童子軍事業能够發達、能夠擴大、那中華民族的劣根性、國許因之而轉變、中華民族前途的曙光、國許就以童子軍事業爲之發端的黎明、本市童子軍各當局各圑員能深深領略這其中的意義、身體而力行、則不獨過去一切無謂的歧流隨之消滅、大家相親相愛開誠布公共同努力、以求上海童子軍事業的難步、那末未來的光榮、即在目前呢、</p>
<p>在革命過程中的現在、黨治下的童子軍的使命、較之各國的童子軍特别重大、己如上述所以我們要完成我們的使命、便須遵照蔣總司令在第一次全國總檢閲訓示我們「思想要純正、勿爲三民主義以外的邪説所動摇動機要純潔勿爲一切插污苟且的心理所蒙蔽、要有自强自立的精神忍苦耐勞的毅力勿務外表的虚華應求内心的充實」上海尤爲全國的精華所在、文化所萃一舉一動都牽動全國可知我們的責任更是何等的重大呵、吾人惟有頃刻不忘的自愓自勵、遵守童子軍所有的信條、以担當一切艱難巨大的責任</p>
<p>最後吾人希望上海的童子軍事業、以原有的份子爲種子而日漸發達開來、務祈童子軍的組織普及於上海的各界在明年雙十節的大檢閲、人數能五倍十倍乃至於無數倍於今年的數目、同時童子軍的工作組織訓練、都能與時俱進的向前進展、才不失我們今年雙十節一番檢閲的苦衷與檢閲的意義我們共同來高呼兩句口號中華民國萬歲中國國民黨萬歲、中國童子軍萬歲、上海童子軍萬歲、</p>

<h3>國貨運動大會</h3>
<p>第二日記</p>
<p>昨日爲本市第三届國貨運動大會之第二日、下午三時起、敦請中華職業敎育社潘仰堯君演講、殿以遊藝、茲將各種情形、探錄如左、</p>
<p>▲潘仰堯演詞略謂、今日是上海市第三届國貨運動大會第二天、市社會局請名人來演講、兄弟本來没有什麽話可講、但旣來了、不能不有幾句閒話貢獻、我的題目、是説提倡國貨與國民生死問題、因爲現在社會上最嚴重的問題、即是失業問題、許多人謀不到職業、像今天報上登載着有一姓衛的、他爲失業的關係、他的妻子多死在黄浦江裏、他自己雖然己經救了起來、但是我們看了總覺得十分可憐、失業問題嚴重到如此地步、我們應該覺司了、雖然、外國也在閙失業問題、但是他們是因爲生産過剩的原故、我們中國是爲了大家用洋貨、因爲大家用洋貨、以致於造成許多失業的人、換句話説、那姓衛的、就是用洋貨的人呌他死的、現在我們中國很好的地方人才、都給外國人來利用、我們還要用洋貨、你看我們吃的、穿的、用的、自己國貨實在很少、所以社會局要舉行這個國貨運動大會、就是要大家不要再去用洋貨、使得國貨振興起來、失業的人减少起來、不致再有像昨天姓衛的一樣、提倡國貨的方法、要分三層、第一層、是女太太們的責任、因爲吃的穿的用的、大部分是女太太們在那裏採辦、尤其是化妝品家用什物、女太太們要負大部責任、英國布廠就覺到這一層、所以他們曾經宣言、如果女太太們人人的裙子、都能用國貨、他們廠家不但不會失敗、一定是能夠很發達的、第二層、是要廠主負責任、不要專爲個人利益着想、要同時想方法解决許許多多人的失業問題、就是振興國貨、最近像上海絲廠倒閉了一百零六家、每家平均工人在三百人以上、這三萬多人失業之後、安插到那裏去、自然是弱者像那姓衛的一樣自殺、强者去做强盜綁票匪流氓、如果國貨振興起來、社會上便可减少許多的壞事情和失業的人、第三層、是希望工人也負責任來、要明白不是替廠主賺錢、或是爲自己謀生、是要想自己的出品、能夠勝過外貨、也就是不要專爲個人的吃飯問題、要想到能夠帮助許多門多失業的人、將來大家有飯吃、所謂勞資合作起來、工人認眞做工、改良工作、那時工人的效力、比資本家來得大、商店服務的店員、也要存這種心、有這種精神、要我有了飯吃、大家也有飯吃、我再説一句、是提倡國貨、水費者方面、應由主婦負責、資本方面、應由廠主負責、勞工方面、應由工人負責、至於一般去買物件、也要注意買國貨、譬如買了一盒自來火來、如果是鳳凰牌、情願將去掉換、現在店家、往往貪圖洋貨利息厚、故意推銷洋貨、店家只知洋貨利息厚、不曉得因而使國内增加了許多失業的人、所以我們無論是買只牙刷．一包牙粉．一只面盆．都是要國貨、這纔是提倡國貨的精神和責任、最可痛的、我們中國不要説穿的用的吃的十九多是洋貨、其至於米也要吃洋貨、而且是日本米也輸到中國來、這豈不是危險到萬分、日本一個小國、他又不是以農立國的、他尙有米能源源輸送過來、供給我中國人吃、這是如何説得過去、所以提倡國貨、是國民生死關頭的大問題、我現在也不多講了、總而言之、提倡國貨、是要使大家知道、是中國人人應負的責任、便是了、</p>
<p>▲大會遊藝每日下午一時至六時、在國産聯合大商塲樓上花花世界舉行、一律憑劵入塲、凡在商塲購買满五角者、得贈劵一張、或備函向南市小南門社會、局索取、惟每函至多以十張爲限、六時後仍照該世界向章辦理、</p>

<h3>浦江輪艦互撞</h3>
<p>▲均未傷人</p>
<p>寗紹公司滬甬班輪新寗紹號、昨日午後五時十五分、由滬出口、開赴寗波、行至太古公司碼頭前江面、與盛京輪及英艦康福惠爾號互相撞擊、致兩船均各損壞、茲將詳情分記如後、</p>
<p>▲肇禍情形新寗紹輪昨日赴甬、船上旅客極多、在南市碼頭開出、行至相近陸家嘴時、潮水正落、故在行過太古公司新北京碼頭前江面時、適遇該公司長江輪盛京號在浦、以掉頭靠埠、盛京船尾、横出江中、新寗紹見此情形、急切避讓、而與盛京船尾相碰、幸兩船各打倒車、故傷勢尙微、盛京輪仍得照常裝貨、</p>
<p>▲碰撞英艦在太古碼頭前、抛有英艦康福惠爾號、在新寗紹行至該處、垂落潮前進、而因盛京輪之船身、横阻江面、航道亦爲之蔽没、新寗紹船主忻季香鑒於江流甚急、將與英艦猛撞、發生巨禍、急令司機者速「車左舵」穿過河筒、勿使與英艦正面猛撞、幸而左舵車得速快、僅將英艦之錨練撞斷、錨即失落、而英艦之船頭、向東便帶横、與新寗紹頭部右舷相撞、雙方均皆撞破、</p>
<p>▲艦輪損壞英艦船頭之鼻、被新寗紹撞破、約有一尺餘見方一大洞、而新寗紹之船頭右舷巴門黑綫處、亦被英艦船頭撞成一洞、當肇事以後、新寗紹開還碼頭、報告公司、一面由船主忻季香、親赴英籃、察看損壞之處、以便交涉修理、而盛京輪尾、則僅微損、當相撞之時、艦輪船員旅客、均無損害、</p>
<p>▲展緩出口新寗紹輪、由船主向公司取得水泥一桶、上船臨時將損處修理、因無碍吃水、故仍令開行赴甬、惟因與英艦艦長接洽、故展延到晚間八時、方始開離上海、關於此次相撞之責任問題、尙須調查後、方能明白、</p>

<h3>今年國慶應有認識與努力</h3>
<p>（Ａ）應有的認識（一）國家方面由國民革命以建設國家、其最要條件、在民衆力量之充實與奮發以十九年來之經騐、深知國民革命的　展與民衆力量的開展、成爲正比例、在今年的國慶紀念日日、我們環顧國内狀况、更可證明中國的革命己經走進了一個新的階段軍閥政痞黨棍殘餘的反動力、己經敵不過全國人民擁護中央、保持統一、厲行建設堅决意志、所以一般叛逆遣亂之初、莫不聲勢浩大、但曾不幾時、莫不潰敗消滅、凡我同胞對於這個偉大的力量、應有深切的認識、至於國民政府由形式上的統一而進於政治外交、軍事的統一、地方自治由愼密的計劃而進於步步的實施、打倒帝國主義、己經由消極的反抗而進於積極的自强、一切的一切、都是需要民衆的力量、作最後勝利的保障（二）本黨方面其次、在本黨方面我們也感覺的的己經不似以前的那樣基磋動摇了、殺人放火的共産黨不用説、早己清了出去、京是勾結共黨隂謀破壞本黨的改組派、也一律</p>
<p>他方面己從腐化惡化份子的清除、而着手於革命分子的吸收徵求預備黨員了、黨的進行、一方面己從過去的游行喊口號、而着手於下唇七項運動之實際工作、他方面己從散漫自發的宣傅、而進於宣傅訓練的統一了黨的主義、也逐漸的由原則的政網政策而變爲國民生活實際軌範的法律了黨和政治的關係、也不像從前的渺不相涉而漸漸要從政治的實施上透出黨的意志來了總之、一切的一切、都是顯然的表示、本黨己由整理到發展、由虚浮到實際、由熱烈的革命情緒到統一的革命行動、黨的内部整理己經大致完成、而黨的實際運用己逐漸恢復未清黨以前的機能了、</p>
<p>（Ｂ）今後的努力國家和本黨的現狀、己進於新的階段、俱如以上所述、但國家和黨的危機仍然很多、一觸即發、未容樂觀、而且這也不過僅僅進人一個新的階段而己並不是革命己經成功、好比大門是己經進了、但是能否升堂入室、全靠自己的努力、現在試就今後主要的和目前重要的工作、申述如下、（一）主要的、（甲）厲行地方自治努力七項下憎運動工作辛亥革命失敗的原因、在於地方自治的基磋没有建立起來這是總理曾經很沉痛的説過的了、總理説没有地方自治做根基的建設、其流弊（一）不能打破官治（二）人、其流弊（一）不能打破官治（二）人民不了解中央與省之政治（三）選舉適爲劣紳土豪之求官捷徑、人民失參與國事之根據而國事操縱於武人官僚之手、七項下層運動的工作、、就是地方自治的基本工作、調查户口、測量土寺、就是地方自治的基本設施、各種地方自治法規就是地方自治實施的軌範各地方的民衆圑體的組織、就是地方自治的基本組織、所以我們今後有運動就要做下層七項運動有帮助就要帮助政府調查户口測量土地、有組織就要組織各個地方的民衆圑體、我們活動的依據就是地方自治的各種法規如此、不僅使匪共永遠絶跡於鄉里、完成革命使命、亦將由此莫定鞏固的基磋、這就是我們今後應該努力的第一件大事、（乙）厲行革命外交取消一切不平等條約、總理説、「不平等條約是中國人民的賣身契」我們若不能達到廢餘不平等條約的目的則中華民族之一切企求無復希望、但是加不平等條約於中國的帝國主義者、是專靠不平等條約來榨取中國以爲生存的、他决不能聽從中國的企求而自掘墳墓、所以不平等條約的廢除、决不能憑藉普通的外交、尤其不能靠北京政府式的外交、必須有革命的外交、所謂革命的外交者乃以全民族的意志、指導外交的進行、要從事於全民族的實際建設、使帝國主義者失却不平等條約的依據、要有所屈不撓和平自衛的精神使帝國主義者不得不終於屈服、這樣的外交才是革命的外交這就是我們今後應該努力的第二件大事（丙）實行徵兵制度努力民生主義的經濟建設一辛亥革命之所以成功是由於封建的軍閥脱離彼等中樞的統制而與革命勢力結合而辛亥革命之所以失敗、也是由於推翻满清的武力是是假他人、而最後的一幕又是與軍閥妥協以成、所以革命勢力終不能造成新組織之中心的民衆武力、以代替舊組織之中心的軍閥武力但是要造成眞正的民衆武力、必定要廢除現在軍閥武力之根源的僱傭兵制而代以國民兵制的徵兵制度、但是要廢除現在的僱傭兵制就必須消滅與此軍隊組織相伴而來之社會狀態質言之我們現在要積極裁兵、就不能趕快設法安置被裁者之不再失業、和己失業者之再流而爲兵爲匪這不是喊口號遊行所能辦到的必要發展中國的生産努力經濟的建設但是這種的經濟建設、必然要民生主義的經濟建設方不至再蹈資本主義的覆轍、以遣後日無窮之患所以實行徵兵制度、努力民生主義的經濟建設就是今後應努力的第三件大事這些都是依於三民主義而必須切實努力以求於最短期内促其實現的我們不能有絲毫的遲疑、更不可有絲毫的懈怠、起來同志們、同胞們努力幹呵（一）目前的今後應努力的主要工作具如上述、現在再就目前應該努力的幾項工作、簡單的條舉如下、（一）帮助中央軍澈底肅清叛逆此次叛逆集圑、由閣逆錫山、馮逆玉祥、汪逆精衛等網羅一切新舊腐惡勢力、以求一逞、中央力求除惡務盡、一勞永逸最後勝利、確有把握不過爲缩短此討逆的時期非全國同胞、一致的聲討和實力的援助不可（二）亟速辦理清鄉殲除匪共年來共匪乘中央軍討逆軍事之緊張、潛滋暗長嘯聚爲患、湘鄂贛三省同胞更備受其蹂躪、中央己責成武漢行營主任何應欽同志專理剿共之事尙望全國同胞一致努力切實清鄉、剷除共匪之根株、保障地方之安靖、（三）鞏固中央肅清一切反動勢力革命要有力量就必須集中起來、中央就是集中革命力量的大本營、中央有什麽不满足的地方、人人都負有提出意見給中央採納、貢獻能力擔任一部分工作的義務、所以革命的份子必定要鞏固中央、集中在中央指導之下、爲黨爲民族而奮鬥、惟有反革命的份子、才惟恐中央之鞏固、甚至造謡中傷以希　其破壞而使革命的事業不能完成、所以我們應鞏固中央肅清一切反動勢力以促革命建設的猛進</p>
<p>▲標語口號辛亥革命是中華民族的復興辛亥革命是推翻满清創立民國的日子辛亥革命是中國民主政治的新紀元、辛亥革命是中國國内各民族一律平等的紀念日、辛亥革命是總理領導同志奮鬥的結果、紀念國慶要厲行地方自治、紀念國慶要努力經濟建設紀念國慶要打倒閣逆錫山馮逆玉祥汪逆兆銘、紀念念國慶要剷除共産黨匪紀念國慶　要忘了實行總理的革命方略、紀念國慶要鞏固中央、紀念國慶要肅清一切反動勢力、紀念國慶要打倒赤白帝國主義、紀念國慶要取消一一切不平等條約、中國國民黨萬歲中華民國萬歲</p>

<h3>答謝贊助國貨運動諸君</h3>
<p>潘公展</p>
<p>▲如何解除國貨前途的困難市社會局奉市政府令准、於本年雙十節前後一週間、舉行本市第三届國貨運動大會、承各機關各圑體以及各界碩彦閨閣名媛的贊助、萬分感謝萬分榮幸、我們要編輯一册特刋、廣事宣傅、又荷荷部長張市長寵鍚題詞、以及黨部同志學者名流惠賜鴻文、增光篇幅、尤其應該代國貨工商界致謝、不過我們要答謝贊助國貨運動的許多先生夫人小姐們、不能憑空説幾句客套話就算了事我們應該體會諸位提倡國貨的熱忱、希望國貨事業發達的盛意拿出一個實際問題來、和諸位切實討論一番、或者從本届大會裡、可以羣策羣力的去解决這個難題、然後諸位的熱忱盛意方可不致　負、還個嚴重而急迫的問題就是如何解除國貨前途的困難、我在提倡這個問題之前、曾經大略讀過這册國貨運動大會特刋裡的許多鴻文、分析開來、諸位先生用意固然各有所惠注、例如陶百川同志和徐玉書（永祚）先生、陳廷楨先生等的提倡一般國貨生産、樊仲雲先生的提倡國貨日用品的生産、朱義農先生、馮子明先生和陶希聖先生的特别注重本國的農業生産品、潘仰堯（文安）先生的特别注重於科學管理和金融合作、嚴獨鶴先和陳令僧先生的喚起婦女界的努力、以及李浩然先生和周瘦鵑先生等的希望國人共同奮起、分盡責任、查仲堅（人偉）先生的希望國貨運動不要以傅道式始以傅道式終等等、可是總合起來、他們都深切的感到國貨的發達决不是單靠消費者一方面的圑結可以濟事．尤其不是一年一度的形式上的開會所可達到目的、換言之他們都誠懇喊了出來「努力發達國貨生産、可是國貨的生産」爲什麽要有待於發達呢、（未完）</p>

<p>乙女那麽伊爲甚麽至今没有出嫁呢。</p>
<p>甲女因爲伊所喜歡的男子。大都是不喜歡伊的。</p>
<p>甲你怎麽老是抱着獨身主義。不想結婚。要知結婚生活的風味。再好没有。眞甜蜜得比蜜糖還甜。</p>
<p>乙且慢。你結婚了多久了。</p>
<p>甲剛满一月。</p>
<p>乙原來如此。</p>
<h3>中秋賞月憶景華</h3>
<p>— 自在長老</p>
<p>一年一度之中秋節。怱怱過去矣。廣州有「龍濟光請賞月」一語。是指其人死於非命。即前廣州警察廳長陳景華被害之紀念也。陳爲香山人。清光緒年間。以名孝廉出宰桂之容縣。幹練剛直。清潔不阿民皆悦服。岑春煊時督兩廣。招撫鉅匪陸阿發。陳知陸賊性難改。嗾差殺之。被岑撤差拿辦。遂遁南洋。投身報館。主持筆政。從事革命運動。</p>
<p>民元之春。陳司粤省警政。赫赫嚴威。使人生畏。廣州有所謂「百二友」者。白鞋緑襪。招摇過市。搶掠嚇殺。無惡不作。陳逐一捕殺。臨刑輙給强盜牌香烟一枝。粤人遂以吸「派律」烟爲不祥。羣相不吃。於是强盜牌烟。無人過問。抵制外貨。别一法也。</p>
<p>陳事必躬親。批示文告。不肯假人。文詞簡單。多則十餕語。小只兩三句。一切爲佈告事與切切凛遵等套語。屏棄不用。某次有塾師失竊。報案。陳援筆批云。「偷到先生苜蓿盤。此等酸賊。煞是可憐。實亦可惡。案存緝匪究辦」等語。又某次佈告。開首即言。」景華以殺人著。夫人皆知。母俟贅述」。其公文之奇突别緻。可見一斑。</p>
<p>警察解送人犯。陳輒雙目炯炯作光。苟逢其知。必曰「打靶」。（粤諺即槍斃）警吏即執行槍决。人犯無申辯之餘地。若其厲聲大駡。則只判罰金或拘押數月耳。聞陳長警政年半。殺人盈千。從無枉死一人。其目力過人。有如此者。</p>
<p>陳每外出。屏絶侍從。風雨旦暮。隨意所之。或考崗警學識。或查區署工作。賞罰分明。惟才是用。舊紳豪商。上司軍人。親戚知友。苟有關説請託。嚴爲拒絶。行政决事。一秉大公。故斯時警政。上下廉潔。極爲清明。而一般劣紳訟棍。恨之剌骨矣。</p>
<p>潘達微編演「聲聲涙」新劇請題。陳爲題「天地不仁」四字與之。署欵爲「世界罪人陳景華」。意謂天地不仁。萬物芻狗。根力微弱。未克普救衆生。實爲世界罪人。宅心如何。可以推想。</p>
<p>市内之盲妹婢妾少尼妓婦。苟受虐待。自投警署。或被偵悉者。陳則發交女子敎育院。院爲陳所手剏。收容無告婦女達八百餘人。敎育兼施。爲陳在粤最大功績。亦陳間接取死之原因。蓄婢娶妾。類皆有財勢者。解放婦女。至合人道奈不明事理者對之。只有仇恨耳。該院籌辦之初。院長徐君晤陳於警所。陳率筆撰弃言。費時僅十分鐘。當斯時也。手寫口道。神采飛揚。謂平生有此一舉。死亦無憾。曾知死神相促。己踵其後耶。</p>
<p>民二之秋。二次革命失敗。黨人均亡命海外。陳自恃守正無私。負有地方公安之責。不忍遽去。當時龍濟光媚袁固位。并受劣紳奸商聳恿。電袁以陳有異動。龍於中秋之夕。邀陳入署賞月。陳坦然赴約。遂遭慘戮。翌日公佈。全市譁驚。屍陳於市。棺木店聯同拒售棺材。家屬乃在沙面購得洋柩。始克收殮。葬於香港咖啡園。初。陳以黨人昔運軍火。輒假棺木。流弊滋甚。乃令棺木店按旬具報購棺者姓名住址。用資考核。詎商人認爲苛政。罷市以抗。陳即令限二十四小時内復業。否則發封。自問外埠販售。商知難抗。從命開業。及陳死。棺材行聞之。聯拒售棺。以爲報復。</p>
<p>陳有兩妾。居於香港。最得寵者爲莫愁陳自别署無恙。詎知無恙竟有恙。莫愁變長愁。事之不能測度者有如此。前年廣州警界同人。因念陳之功績。醵金鑄像。用志不忘。至今廣州人士。談警政者。莫不追念陳之政績。嗚呼。中秋月冷。南望珠海。人亡政息。不禁撫然。</p>
<h3>保共借鏡</h3>
<p>— 湘省一難民</p>
<p>蔣主席江日電請國民政府大赦政治犯。即殺人放火之共産匪徒。若有人敢保其不再爲匪。經過三年之後。亦可赦免。仁言利溥。殊深欽佩。惟爲共産匪徒之保人者。須有被匪慘殺之覺悟。本年七月二十七湘省共變。有一段慘史。頗足爲保共匪者之殷鑑。急錄之以供將來之借鏡。</p>
<p>袁振黄者。長沙人。曾充湘省共匪感化院代理院長。爲人極講友誼。與鄔尙之有舊。鄔之獨生子鄔怡莊。係共匪中要人。案發被捕。鄔尙之託袁營救。袁爲之多方設法。得以不死。經過感化院感化後。即恢復其自由。此次長沙被共匪政陷。鄔怡莊仍在共匪中執行重要職務。袁則被困城中。極感危險。因思曾救過鄔怡莊。現鄔怡莊旣仍係其黨中要人。託庇於鄔。當能安全。友人雖阻之不顯也。鄔住瀏陽門外。袁冒險前往鄔宅。鄔怡莊不在家。由其父鄔尙之極力招待。慨允包庇。無何。鄔怡莊回家。其父即介紹袁與之相見。並謂此救汝之恩人。應爲設法。鄔怡莊則答云。「我不管這些」一語。即外出。袁見勢不佳。即擬他往。其父仍留之。謂「無論如何。我一定保你。袁遂止。經二小時後。鄔怡莊帶共匪多人前來捕袁。袁即跪地袁求。謂老母年己八十餘。求免一死。以送老母天年。至家産則可全數捐出。鄔怡莊即曰。「你是袁老伯。是我父親的朋友。我也曉得。但是我們共産黨。是不承認父母的。何况是父母的朋友。我若放了你。我們同志一定不依我。」言畢即命匪拖出。匪兵立以繩套袁頸。臉朝地而拖之。拖至瀏陽門。而袁臉部之肉。己盡脱去。匪兵始施以亂刀。委之而去。惟袁雖受重傷。尙未氣絶。共匪佔據長沙時。亦無人爲之掩埋。如此者數日。及至八月五日。國軍入城後。收拾死屍。見袁尙未死。乃送之入醫院醫治。其家人亦集視。遂由其親口自述被害始末如上。又經過一日餘。始氣絶。長沙人初不憐之。以其保共匪。咎由自取也。</p>
<h3>大舞臺觀劇記</h3>
<p>— 陳彦衡</p>
<p>余久不蒞劇塲。適劉君豁公約晚間至大舞臺觀程玉霜探母回令。余以玉霜南來。甚思一晤。重以豁公之約。遂於晚九時半至大舞臺。先到後塲晤玉霜。又見趙桐珊姜妙香吳富琴王少樓乃翁毓樓及杭子和錫子剛陳鴻壽胡鐵芬諸君。故人久别。相見甚歡。及探母登塲。己十句鐘矣。玉霜之劇。端莊流利。功候日深。勿庸詞費。其念字行腔。亦較前多有更易。蓋玉霜近頗講求音韻。隂陽四聲。字斟句酌。不惜力矯羣非。獨參眞諦。此劇學之根本。非等閒所知也。余嘗以青衣競誇新調。不講字音。引爲憾事。玉霜成名己久。當歉然不敢自封。惟日攷攷焉殫精竭慮。從事於根本之學。若玉霜者。誠可謂有志之士。難能而可貴者矣。玉霜約暇日見過。作詳細之研求。余所知未必有稗於玉霜。然以玉霜之好學深思。或因之益有所發明。則精益求精。其藝術之進步。容有止境乎。曲終歸來。己踰午夜。因喜事誌之。時庚午中秋前一日也。</p>
<p>按彦師病胃己經年。輕易不至劇塲。此届玉霜登臺。破格往觀。又爲文以寵之。蓋生平不喜作劇評。其對於玉霜之期許深矣。海昌許姬傅識於海上思潛室。</p>
<h3>南洋游記（六二）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>二十五。接瓦城中華會館電。請到瓦演講。是日在華僑女學講女性地位之三種變遷。大致謂道爲母系時代。爲黄金時代。Ｊ次爲奴隸時代。今爲附屬雄性争　之僞平等時代。此兩時代均雄閥互殺人類。最甚也。校長周慧賢。蘇人。自力創辦。甚有能力也。接張明慈信。知其夫婦到星洲。</p>
<p>二十七日。王芳園租汽車邀道階師萬慧師同游。并照相。夕到韻新詩社閲詩卷。共七十聯。以某君聯爲第一。其句云。新詩報道得仙眷。大政諮詢及野人。余評云。神仙福澤。聖賢度量。置第一名。</p>
<p>二十八號因三次接瓦城中華會館電歡迎。乃乘火車北上。王芳園君來送行。運行李買票甚麻煩。非其來。則不濟矣。王言可預先買票。免到站買時擁擠。余記蘇州賣票法極好。可在各分店代賣處買賣。又一站分數窗賣。余上車前。帶有食物甚多。旣上車乃悔其不需。因沿途賣飲食者太多也。各種水及菓餅　食物具備。且一停車吉能人中人呼加拉人或鬼。即以小車拉至窗外呌賣。又有賣長頸瓦缾者。余初疑之。後乃知天熱人人必須飲。此物以盛水也。三等車價到瓦城六盾。行李可置車中。車中略如吾京滬情形。先到者占地可臥。後到者立久無人問也。中國公道者爲太原至石家莊一路。外人查車。坐客不能侵佔他人位置。行李有一定地點。甚合宜也。車中缅男女吸烟討厭。缅女吸烟爲普通矣。沿途見稻田水黄牛甚多。水牛浮鼻有越。有詩爲證。</p>
<p>仰光千里到門京。（舊京爲門德里Ｍandalay）尖塔疏林映日明。人下稻田牛浮鼻。兒童持钓短橋横。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（二九○）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　涙翠竹斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離</p>
<p>左詩晨道怎麽我到你那裏來没有遇見過呢翠筠道到你來的時候他們己經調出去了也許你在檯面上曾經見過伊的可是你那裏留心到呢。我們出堂唱的時候。無論心廟息樣的傷心。到了檯同上。總要假裝了笑臉去應酬客人。即使爺娘死了。擱在板門上也只好揩揩乾腿涙去出堂唱。所以吃到這碗斷命的堂子飯。一點人道主義都没有的了。不是人家白相堂子。喚做買笑嗎。他們大少爺出了錢。原是來尋快活的。你是一副愁眉苦臉的對着他。人家還開心得出嗎。左詩晨道。洪蓮香旣是書香人家出身。何致於堕落到堂子裏去。翠筠歎了一口氣道。那是告訴你不得。一個人堕落起來。那班做官做府的小姐。吃堂子飯。開私門頭。上鹹肉莊的也多的很咧。起初終是自家不規矩。走了牙路。或者是被人家誘惑了。家裏也没有法子。要把伊關起來吧。也關飶不不好聽其自然。嚴正一點的父母。驅逐伊永遠不許上門。只算這個女兒己經死掉了。在伊却變成了回不得家鄉。見不得爹娘。可謂「一失足成千古恨。」到了那時。伊把心一横。横竪貞操也破了。姘一個姘頭也是壞。姘十幾個姘頭也是壞。名氣終歸是壞的了。索性壞到底。什麽地方不能去呢。起初並不爲了錢。到後來。爺娘旣不肯收留伊了。伊也要吃用。也要裝飾。也要住房子。當然也要求伊的生活。就不能不爲着錢了。不過像洪蓮香那樣。伊不是自己的堕落。實在是爲救濟一家人起見。要是伊不踏到堂子裏來。全家都要餓死了。伊的父親死下來。還欠人家的債。伊常和我説。只要母親能彀過活。兄弟有錢讀書。便是伊自己犧牲一點也不不要緊。伊從來一個錢也不瞎用。眞是我們小姊妹淘裏頂有清頭。頂有把握的人了。我想伊將來决不會落薄的。伊是一個有主義的人。面孔又好。性格又和氣。又是自己做人家。並不浪費。然是包在别人家。到底比我們做討人做押賬的自由得多。誰知伊嫁了一個人。便這樣寃枉孽障的死了。眞正像古人所説的紅顔薄命了。左詩晨道。伊是嫁在上海的嗎。在上海地方。嫁了一個人。不稱心便一走了事。伊何至於要送掉性命呢。像你也不是爲了不稱心出來的嗎。</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、呈疲滯不前之象、因洋麥報價、又小七八角至一元另不等、致大部分之人心、依然看軟、惟大廠家因目標不同、抛停之數景、未見大暢、祗一般内地廠家及本埠之中小廠、以洋麥均有訂購、己始終看小、不欲其漲、故上午初尙平穏、旋因小廠之續出、各月份遂無形見疲、後步如洋麥再小、當須再軟一些耳、結果本月份較前日小七厘半、十一月份小七厘半、十二月份小一分三厘半、一月份小一分半、二三月份小一分七厘半云、</p>
<h3>由低趨高的麥市</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後各月份市面呈初疲繼堅之象上午開盤因洋麥報價續小七八角至一元零故人心仍見低軟、惟人户空頭（或傅某大廠）對近遠各期買意忽濃連續購買數量售巨因此疲滯之勢、反呈堅定　此　做品、或者另有作用也、結果本月份較前日好三分、十一月份好二分、十二月份好三分、正·二·三月份好二分、現麥市面、因檢騐關係、價見穏固至檢騐之手續及費用目下仍未解决想尙有幾日之談判也、開山東白麥宿州瑶灣碭山黄橋宿遷麥共六千三百包、由申大等廠辦去云</p>
<h3>客秈略有客化</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到頭仍稀、而客化略活、如寗波帮採辦中次米、厦門帮則選辦機晚及機早中之高貨、惟去數不多、均祇數百包本街鄉莊續有應酬、統市成交江西機早一千六百包、價十元零七角半、十元零二角至九元六角半、又機晚五百包、價十二元六角至十一元九角四分、又粹米一百十四包、價七元二角、洋米被客秈杜米影響、迄今未有受主、一號西貢進户祇還十三元、貨主二成本昂大、最少須售十三元半云、</p>
<p>絲茶無錫白廠經運滬激暢</p>
<p>無錫絲廠業、近因廠絲歐銷疲滯己極、資金虧折益鉅、無力維持、勢將破産、而公量檢騐仍未銷、同業公議與滬廠商取一致行動、同盟停業、所有各廠承抛洋行之本月份期絲、亟應提前交解是以連日滬錫客車、均有白廠經運滬、自前星期起運到絲額己達三百四十五包云、</p>
<h3>滬廠經産減價漲</h3>
<p>本埠各廠莊自滬絲廠同盟罷業後、外埠絲廠亦均分起響應、取一致步驟、則絲産日減、揑意益濃、而廠方態度堅挺、索價益高、昨由達昌等進十一·二月份滬白廠經三十包、新時昌等進白乾經十五包、價均堅漲云、</p>
<h3>茶市暢滯不一</h3>
<p>昨日本埠來莊之貢熙緑茶及寗州紅茶、俄國協助會進意續趨農厚、惟認價又復苛緊、交易略形減色、珍眉·針眉等項、英法各莊均無大宗去路、大帮绿茶、完全停滯、茶市趨勢、仍難認爲樂觀云、</p>
<p>閘北貨本耳申漢市價倒懸</p>
<p>木耳據漢口訉、副耳爲一百五十四兩、什耳一百零三兩、均難划申、故來源寥寥、此間客貨時有開出、價較宜、什耳爲百零三四兩、次略減、銷路方面、港粤兩帮、均觀望不動、别帮亦僅零星交易、昨市行盤高副耳爲一百六十五兩、本牌一百十兩至零八兩、什耳一百零五兩、市象平疲、</p>
<p>糖市日車糖市象轉挺</p>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訉古巴現糖價爲一·一五六二五比前電步漲三一二五、紐約期糖十二月份價一·一八、三月份一·二八、各升三分、五月份一·三四、九月份一·四八、各升二分爪哇期現糖均無升降、公會粗砂白買氣雖寥、市形尙能站穏、新貨價仍八兩、河行貨八兩零五分、高八兩一錢、略有成交、磨細砂白八兩、二十號中砂白七兩四錢半、八號荷赤六兩三錢、交易見懈、日糖以市存轉薄、明華廠開工時日尙屬有待、走銷方面、零星尙覺活躍、因是市氣漸覺轉挺、Ｎ　七兩九錢半、ＳＨ　七兩七錢二分半　　八兩一錢、ＹＲ　七兩五錢半ＹＴ　七兩七錢七分半ＹＰＯ　七兩九錢七分半、後市至八兩、市氣尙穏、號盤有華新號售開現貨八號荷赤數百袋、價六兩三錢略高者六兩三錢半、需要不盛、市則不奇、</p>
<p>五金英白鐵貨缺價挺</p>
<p>英白鐵最近存貨淺薄而到源寥落、因此購者有無貨可購之概而盼望者日益衆多、標準日見上漲、刻市如二十二號每担售十二兩五錢二十四號十二兩二錢半、二十六號十四兩、二十八號十四兩七錢半、三十一號十六兩二錢半、查連日如長江·天津·烟台·青島以及本街建築帮等、均有買進、故數日來己開出四五百担之鉅、查開出之貨、尤以二十六號及二十八號佔最多云、</p>

<h3>Commander-in-Chief Chiang's Circular Telegram</h3>
<p>The Battle Situation in Henan Province</p>
<p>Over 100,000 Soldiers of Feng's Army Captured</p>
<p>The Area South of the Yellow River to Be Cleared Imminently</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang issued a circular telegram on the 7th to the Central National Government, various ministries, departments, and commissions, provincial and municipal governments, and commanders and division commanders of various routes: Since I, Chiang Kai-shek, was ordered to suppress the rebellion, I have deeply considered the Central Government's initial intention to seek peace and earnestly hope to end the war as soon as possible. Since mid-August, when our army recovered Jinan and repeatedly defeated the rebel army fiercely attacking along the Longhai Railway, I immediately sent a telegram to the National Government, requesting the issuance of a clear order, only seeking that Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang accept their guilt and retire to a remote area. The remaining troops and soldiers would be granted amnesty and allowed to start anew. Unexpectedly, Yan and Feng obstinately refused to repent. Instead, they actively organized a puppet government, attempting to plunge our completely unified party and nation into a state of destruction and division. I, Chiang Kai-shek, had no choice but to encourage the officers and soldiers to advance bravely. The Longhai Railway Army was divided into three armies: the Right, Central, and Left Wings. The Pinghan Railway Army was divided into nine columns, organized into Right and Left Wings. The two routes echoed each other from afar, advancing together, aiming to encircle and annihilate the rebel forces in one fell swoop. Since the general offensive began on the [omitted] day of last month, we have achieved successive victories, capturing famous cities such as Linru, Ziyou, Mixian, Fugou, Yanling, and Kaocheng, all recovered before the [omitted] day of last month. Furthermore, Vice Commander Zhang Xueliang sent a telegram on the [omitted] day, supporting the Central Government, maintaining unification, and advancing troops towards Beiping and Tianjin. The puppet government and the puppet enlarged conference fled in disarray, and our army's prestige grew even stronger. Continuing our efforts, we occupied Xushui Town and Rongyang Railway Station on the [omitted] day, occupied Guanting Railway Station on the [omitted] day, recovered Lanfeng on the [omitted] day, and recovered Weishi, Xichuan, and Chenliu counties on the 30th. On the [omitted] day of this month, we recovered Changge and also occupied Zhuxian Town. On the [omitted] day, we cleared the remnants of the enemy in the Xuchang, Suqiao, and Heshangqiao areas. On the [omitted] day, we recovered Kaifeng, and the rebel army collapsed, capturing a large number of prisoners. The Fifth Column, having been ordered to attack Luoyang, successively occupied Longmen and key areas west of the Longhai Railway, encircling Luoyang and cutting off the rebels' escape route to Shaanxi and Gansu. High-ranking enemy generals, understanding the greater good, abandoned the rebels and submitted to our cause. For example, Ji Hongchang, Liang Guanying, and others have been successively appointed as commanders-in-chief of the 12th and 25th Routes. Zhang Yinxiang and others have been appointed as army commanders, and Zhang Zhankui has been appointed as division commander. Many others have also expressed their willingness to serve the party and the nation. After the recovery of Kaifeng, the battle areas have been connected into a single line, without the distinction between the Pinghan and Longhai Railways. Therefore, the Left and Right Wings of the Pinghan Railway Army were reorganized into the Left Wing and Central Army Corps, while the three armies of the Longhai Railway were reorganized into the 10th, 11th, and 12th Columns of the Right Wing Army Corps, advancing rapidly to join forces in Zhengzhou. According to a report from our Central Army Corps, our army recovered Zhengzhou on the evening of the [omitted] day and completely occupied it. Furthermore, according to reports from the Central and Left Wing Army Corps, over 100,000 troops under Zhang Weixi, Sun Liangcheng, Sun Lianzhong, and others near Xinzheng have been completely captured without any escaping. Song Zheyuan's troops in Luoyang are also being besieged by our Fifth Column and will hardly escape. The area south of the Yellow River will be cleared imminently. It is heard that Feng is at the end of his rope, with dwindling strength and widespread desertion. Any further resistance is impossible. Peaceful unification is now indeed hopeful. However, those who resort to arms and commit offenses are guilty of treason. The focus of the aftermath should be on comforting the afflicted people and resettling the displaced. Troops who sincerely return to our cause should be treated equally and given preferential treatment, entrusting them with the future of the party and the nation. I am currently urging the prompt handling of the above matters. I hereby report the victory. Chiang Kai-shek, respectfully.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Unemployment Issue is Global in Nature</h3>
<p>British Prime Minister MacDonald stated that the unemployment issue is global in nature and cannot be resolved by the efforts of one country alone. His words are correct and truly reveal a deep understanding of the world's reality. He also said that Britain has signed a tariff truce treaty in Geneva, hoping to initiate negotiations on tax rates among various industrialized countries in the world. If such negotiations are unsuccessful, the British government can freely adopt other methods. I think his words are not necessarily true. Why? MacDonald's idea is that if the tariff truce treaty is successful and tariff negotiations are effective, the world's unemployment problem can be resolved. In other words, MacDonald believes that the world's unemployment problem arises from tariff wars between countries, where mutual resistance to importing goods from other countries obstructs the goods of each country, leading to excessive goods and a decline in commerce. This is only knowing one aspect and not knowing the other. Why? Although the unique goods of each country are obstructed by tariff wars, the ordinary goods of each country are available to each country and are rarely imported among industrialized countries. The current surplus of goods in the world is even more severe for ordinary goods than for unique goods. Even if tariffs are suspended, ordinary goods still cannot be sold among industrialized countries. Why? Each country suffers from excess. Therefore, fundamentally speaking, to solve the world's unemployment problem, industrial reform is necessary. If industrialized countries continue to compete with each other by advancing machinery and increasing the speed and quantity of output, no matter what, the supply will exceed the demand. How can commerce avoid declining?</p>

<p>Announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<h3>British Refund of Boxer Indemnity Exchange of Notes</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced at 4:00 PM on the 8th the main points of the exchange of notes between Minister Wang and British Ambassador Blue regarding the resolution of the Boxer Indemnity refund: Regarding the refund of the remaining amount of the British portion of the Boxer Indemnity, the exchange of notes between Foreign Minister Wang and British Ambassador Blue in China was resolved on September 19th and 22nd. The British government, after the necessary bill is passed by the parliament, will hand over the entire amount of the Boxer Indemnity that should have been paid since December 1, 1922, to the Chinese government for management. The Chinese government will use a large part of the returned funds to establish a foundation to improve and construct railways and invest in other Chinese production enterprises as loans, which should pay interest and be ultimately repaid, so that they can be used for educational undertakings in the future. Regarding the management, distribution, and disposal of the above-mentioned foundation, the Chinese government will establish a board of directors in China, and there will be several British persons on the board. When the Chinese government uses the returned Boxer Indemnity or the loans guaranteed by the Boxer Indemnity to purchase materials, it should order from the United Kingdom. The Chinese government will establish a purchasing material committee in London to conclude various contracts, supply and deliver various machines and materials ordered by the Chinese government in China, and fulfill all obligations on the contract. A savings account will be established for funds that do not need to be used immediately, so that they can be supplied for future needs of the Chinese government. The committee consists of a chairman, who is the Chinese diplomatic representative in London, and one representative from the Chinese Ministry of Railways, and four other members. These other four members will be recommended by the British Foreign Secretary from a list of reliable and experienced business people to the board of directors, and the Chinese government will appoint them after consultation with the board. All existing funds, except for the following two amounts, and one and a half years of all future payments, will be handed over to the material purchasing committee for use in accordance with the above methods. The remaining half of this period will be handed over to the Chinese board of directors for management. All income of the material purchasing committee shall be exempt from various taxes. As for the organization, authority, and execution of duties of the material purchasing committee, several detailed rules have also been agreed upon by both parties. From the total existing amount of the funds, 265,000 pounds and 200,000 pounds will be allocated to the University of Hong Kong for the education of Chinese students and to the London China University Committee for inviting Chinese celebrities to lecture in the UK and promoting cultural relations between China and the UK, respectively.

<h3>Manchurian-Mongolian Railway Plan</h3>
<p>German Loan Underway</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When the German industrial delegation, which recently inspected the economic conditions of Manchuria, arrived in Shenyang, the Northeast Transportation Committee presented the delegation with the details of the completed plan of the Manchurian-Mongolian railway network formulated by the committee. They also made every effort to seek a railway loan of 50 million yuan from a German capital group. The German industrial delegation agreed to act as an intermediary after returning home. Negotiations for this loan are still ongoing and a preliminary contract may be signed soon. The railway network plan formulated by the Northeast Transportation Committee is as follows:</p>
<p>First Trunk Line: Connect Tongliao to Qiqihar and Heihe via Taonan.</p>
<p>Second Trunk Line: Connect Jilin to Suiyuan near Muling and Yilan.</p>
<p>Third Trunk Line: Connect Huludao to Kulun via Rehe.</p>
<p>Each trunk line will have a large number of branch lines.</p>
<p>The National Government is paying close attention to whether the negotiations for this railway loan and the investment of German capital in the Manchurian-Mongolian railway have political implications. They have ordered the Northeast Transportation Committee to investigate the details so that they can study them carefully. Sun Ke's trip to Shenyang is also primarily aimed at investigating the truth about this loan. (Telegram from Japan United News Agency on the 8th)</p>

<h3>Sino-Japanese Shuangqiao Radio Station Issue</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiations are just beginning. Reports from the Japanese press that the Shuangqiao Radio Station issue is also under discussion are untrue. According to those familiar with the inside story of the station, the station was established by the Japanese Mitsui &amp; Co. on behalf of the Beijing Navy Department. It was originally planned to use a Gao Jinbo-style electric power of 500 kilowatts with an antenna tower 250 meters high. However, after the station was completed, all the antennas and electric power were only 200 kilowatts, and the antenna tower was only 210 meters high after being increased, which was completely inconsistent with the original plan and could not be used for international communications. When the machines were shipped from Japan, the Ministry of the Navy heard the news and stated that they could not be accepted, and telegraphed the Tianjin Customs not to issue an import passport. After completion, experts were sent to test it, but they were not satisfied. Therefore, our country has never accepted the station and is naturally not responsible for it. With the recent progress of science, the Gao Jinbo-style is outdated and not suitable for current communications. The station has fundamentally lost its footing. The old Ministry of Communications did not recognize it at the time. After the establishment of the National Government, it also solemnly declared its denial of all patents and special privileges obtained by foreigners in our country. It is also heard that Mitsui &amp; Co. does not have wireless communication rights in Japan, and its representative once proposed to our government to cancel the Shuangqiao Radio Station. Therefore, in terms of law and fact, the station has no room for existence. The Japanese government cannot propose to the Chinese government on behalf of Mitsui &amp; Co.

<h3>Reorganization of the Longhai Bonded Debt is Hopeful</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Key figures from the Longhai Railway and Belgian Company said that the pessimism of the domestic market towards the Longhai Railway shares of the Belgian Company is due to the lack of security for principal and interest. Hence, there have been angry words about selling them to Japan. In fact, there is a solution for the principal and interest. Why sell them to others? Also, because Japan is very strict about debt collection for Sino-Japanese joint railway ventures, unlike the laissez-faire attitude of Europe and the United States, there has been talk of selling to Japan.

Colonel Dufula, leading another force, has also occupied the state of Pernambuco, seizing its capital and Brazil's largest radio station.

The government army hopes to confront it in a major battle near Sao Paulo. It has dispatched warships to various southern ports to blockade harbors occupied by the revolutionaries, cutting off their supplies. It has also ordered the conscription of two types of reservists. However, the people of the capital are experiencing extreme panic due to the difficulty in food supplies after the revolutionary army occupied several major ports.</p>

<p>▲National News Agency, Helsinki, 7th - Initial results of the Finnish general election show that the Social Democratic Party received the most votes, reaching 70 seats so far, an increase of 11 seats compared to the previous term.

If such negotiations are not successful, the British government can freely adopt other methods. Labour MP Maxton moved to criticize the government for failing to adopt socialist policies on unemployment and other matters, but this motion was defeated by a majority.</p>

<p>League of Nations</p>
<h3>Record of Dispute Resolution Over the Years</h3>
<p>Mediated International Disputes 24 Times</p>
<p>Created 5 New Ways of Mediation</p>
<p>▲Geneva News - The 11th General Assembly of the League of Nations has concluded. It seems appropriate to make a small statistic of the overall achievements of the League's work over the past 11 years. According to a report from the Secretariat, the League of Nations was established after the end of the European War and has been involved in the mediation of international disputes a total of 24 times in the past 11 years. Among these disputes, eight had reached a state of actual warfare. These disputes have occurred in almost all parts of the world outside of North America. Those belonging to European countries naturally account for the largest number due to the various disputes that arose after the war. In addition, there were two African cases, one being the dispute between Britain and Italy over water rights in Ethiopia, and the other being the dispute between Britain and France over the nationality of residents in Tunisia. There was one case belonging to Central America, namely the border dispute between Panama and Costa Rica in 1921. There were two cases belonging to Asia, one being the Russian shelling of the Persian port of Enzeli in 1920, and the other being the dispute over the border between Turkey, etc., and Iraq. South America also accounted for one case, which was the border dispute between Paraguay and Bolivia in 1928. From the perspective of the League of Nations' position and foothold, the success or failure of these 24 mediations in 11 years is not very important. The most important point is that the League has gradually completed various methods and mechanisms through these various attempts and experiences so that it can be used at any time in the future. As of now, the League's mediation of international disputes generally has five different methods. The first is the so-called direct method, in which the Executive Council of the League directly intervenes in the countries in dispute in accordance with the authority conferred by the League Covenant, such as when Greek troops invaded Bulgaria in 1925 and Bulgaria sought assistance from the League. The Executive Council telegraphed the Greek army to stop firing, which is one example. The second is to specifically appoint a commission of inquiry to investigate the truth of the conflict between the two parties and then determine the right and wrong. The League's decision should be regarded as final and neither party may object. The third is to invite the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague or a committee composed of other international legal experts to express their opinions to serve as the basis for resolving the dispute. The fourth is for the Executive Council of the League to send a mediation committee to convene the two parties in dispute to negotiate a peaceful solution. This is often done by the League and has been quite effective. The fifth is for the League to persuade both parties to send representatives to negotiate directly in order to seek a solution. In this way, both parties can be unaffected by third parties and have no room for future excuses, sophistry, and regret. (World)</p>

<h3>Remains of the Deceased Arrive in London</h3>
<p>Spectators Fill the Streets, Scene is Tragic and Solemn</p>
<p>Pilot Szilard's Condition Worsens</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 7th - When the coffins of the R-101 disaster victims were transported out of Beauvais today, it was raining heavily. The coffins were loaded onto vehicles, French soldiers played music, and pastors prayed. At each station passed, flags were flown at half-mast. At approximately 4:30 PM, the special train arrived at Bologne Wharf. The coffins were then transferred to a British warship amidst military music. Spectators filled the streets. The British warship arrived in Dover at 9:30 PM. The coffins were placed on the deck, arranged in long rows, surrounded by national flags and covered with wreaths. Rain poured down like holy water. Soldiers then carried each coffin on their shoulders, eight men per coffin, into a special train heading to London.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 8th - The train carrying the coffins arrived at Victoria Station at 1:25 AM. It was dark and cold, but the number of spectators was extremely large, a rare sight. British Prime Minister MacDonald, his daughter, and the families of the deceased were also at the station to greet them. The 47 coffins passed through the solemn crowd and out of the station gate. Accompanying the coffins were three survivors, whose injuries were not serious, allowing them to leave the hospital early. The coffins will be transported by special train to Bedford and then to Cardington, where the R-101 was built. The coffins will be buried in the cemetery of St. Mary's Church. Tomorrow, a memorial service will be held at St. Paul's Cathedral. The British Prince will represent the British government to pay respects, and the French Minister of Aviation will also attend as the representative of the French government.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Beauvais, 7th - A total of five bodies have been identified. Another body was burned and cut in two. This is the origin of the claim of 47 bodies; there are actually only 46.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 7th - British Prime Minister MacDonald mentioned the R-101 airship disaster at the Labour Party Congress today, saying that the inherent creative nature of mankind drives people to the endless seas and uninhabited wastelands. Now we are in the sky. We must conquer the sky, just like conquering deserts and oceans. The British Prime Minister praised the assistance of the French government and people. ▲Reuters, Paris, 7th - British Ambassador to France Tyrell sent a letter to French Prime Minister Theodore on behalf of the British King, expressing gratitude for the assistance of the French government and the local officials of Beauvais and Arloye.

<h3>Hoover's Anti-Communist Arguments</h3>
<p>Extreme Pacifism and Force</p>
<p>Both Sufficient to Invite Foreign Disaster</p>
<p>▲Associated Press, South Carolina, 7th. President Hoover's speaking tour today took him to a textile-producing region here recently troubled by labor unrest and communist agitation. Mr. Hoover refuted societal fallacies, saying that socialists and communists advocate forcing natural trends, like stopping a race midway, forcibly slowing those in front and hindering those behind, claiming this can create equality, which is utterly wrong. Furthermore, those who embrace this doctrine often aim to reject religion, but without religious foundations, there can be no perfect social order and solid economic system, which is absolutely impossible. Extreme materialism can hardly maintain human loyalty for long. Once a system based on law is broken, who cannot commit crimes and create chaos? Mr. Hoover also stated that extreme pacifism and extreme militarism both lead to inviting foreign disaster. The former encourages a spirit of cowardice, while the latter easily breeds arrogance. He also said that to enjoy the benefits of being a citizen, one must properly exercise the right to vote. The opportunity for young people with revolutionary ideas to emerge is not limited to the political sphere, and so on.</p>

<p>No Room for Savings in the Japanese Army Ministry</p>
<p>Negotiations Between the Navy and Finance Ministries Begin</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th. Yesterday, Army Minister Ugaki stated at Kofu-tsu that he regretted that the military administration reform plan could not be implemented from the previous year due to his illness.

<h3>Public Telegrams</h3>
<p>○ Zhengzhou Telegram to All Newspapers: Heaven has brought disaster upon China. Yan and Feng have initiated chaos, rebelling in the north against the central government, poisoning the lives of the people. Their various crimes are too numerous to count. Zhengzhou, located in the heart of Henan province, is a battleground. The rebellious bandits have entrenched themselves for a long time, and the people are suffering deeply. Our Commander-in-Chief Chiang and all the officers and soldiers of the Central Army are faithfully carrying out the teachings of the late Premier, vowing to fight for the Party and the nation, launching a large-scale punitive expedition to condemn their crimes. Jinan and Kaifeng were successively recovered, and on [unclear character] day, Zhengzhou was completely occupied. Heaven's light shines again, and the masses rejoice. However, at this time, when the main force has just arrived and the remnants of the rebels are still being cleared, local security is of utmost importance, and post-war matters must also be planned. Now, the military, government, business, and other sectors have organized a Provisional Committee for Maintaining Public Order, jointly electing the Chief of the First Propaganda Brigade of the local court, the Zhengzhou Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Police Bureau, and the Zheng County District Chief as members of this committee. The President of the local court was mutually elected as the temporary chairman. On [unclear character] day, they began working at the Municipal Government address. Once local order is restored, it will be dissolved. We earnestly hope that the Party and nation's leaders and sages within the country will provide guidance so that we may follow it. We are extremely hopeful and specially send this telegram to report. We request your consideration. The Provisional Committee for Maintaining Public Order of Zheng County and City, respectfully.</p>
<p>○ Guide Telegram to All Newspapers: At 8:00 PM tonight, the Guide Railway Station caught fire due to a cigarette or careless handling of gasoline. Only two freight cars were burned, and the fire lasted for three hours. Our department dispatched a team to suppress the fire and attempted to extinguish it. Fortunately, there were no accidents. Fearing that rumors from afar would be inaccurate, we are sending this telegram to report. Nie Xiuzhang, Commander of the Headquarters Special Operations Team, on [unclear character] morning, respectfully.</p>

<h3>Central Army Recovers Zhengzhou</h3>
<p>▲Liu Zhi and He Guo-guang Have Advanced to Xuchang</p>
<p>▲Commander-in-Chief Chiang Personally Arrives in Zhengzhou to Reassure the People</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Regarding the battles on the Pinghan Railway line, after the Central Army's second general offensive, the left wing recovered Longmen, the right wing recovered Weishi, and the central route recovered Xuchang. Zhengzhou could be captured at any moment. Initially, Feng Yuxiang had more than ten divisions in Zhengzhou. When Zhang Xueliang's clever telegram was sent, he still considered actively counterattacking. Therefore, fierce battles occurred in Xinzheng, Changge, Weishi, Yuchuan, Lushan, Baofeng, Linru, and Xiangcheng south of Zhengzhou. When the Feng Army advanced to Pingjin, the Feng Army had no choice but to retreat completely. On the 22nd of last month, a general retreat order was issued, and Feng himself went north to Taiyuan from Zhengzhou. The responsibility for defending Zhengzhou was entrusted to Lu Zhonglin. The Central Army believed that the situation in Henan could be completely resolved with the Feng Army's retreat. Therefore, Liu Zhi, the commander-in-chief of the Second Army Corps, and He Chengjun, the commander-in-chief of the Third Army Corps, ordered Xu Yuanquan, Xiao Zhichu, Yang Hucheng, Xia Douyin, Hao Mengling, Shangguan Yunxiang, Tan Daoyuan, Chen Cheng, Yue Weijun, Rong Jingfang, Liu Peixu, and other divisions and brigades to continue their pursuit in three routes. On the right wing, the troops of Xu Yuanquan, Xiao Zhichu, Chen Cheng, and some of the troops of Xia Douyin, Hao Mengling, and Shangguan Yunxiang first occupied Yanling, Changge, Yuchuan, Weishi, Zhuxianzhen, and Zhongmu. On the left wing, all of Yang Hucheng and Wang Naiwen's troops, after clearing the enemy in Lushan, captured Baofeng, Linru, Dengfeng, and Yanshi. On the central route, Liu Zhi's First Division, Yue Weijun, Liu Peixu, and some of Xia Douyin's troops occupied Xuchang on the 3rd of this month, approaching Zhengzhou directly from Xinzheng. Liu Zhi, He Guo-guang, and others stationed troops in Xuchang on the 4th from Luohe, directing the advance of various armies, using part of their forces to surround and disarm the Feng Army's weapons near Xinzheng, and using the majority of their forces to attack Zhengzhou fiercely. At that time, the Feng Army's Ji Hongchang, Zhang Yinxiang, and other troops had surrendered to the Central Government. Liang Guanying's troops also expressed their allegiance. Deng Baoshan, Ren Yingqi, Tian Jinkai, and Shi Zhenqing's troops were all surrounded and disarmed. Lu Zhonglin and others knew that things could not be done, so they retreated in two routes on the evening of the 5th. One route crossed the river at Jingshuizhen, and the other route fled north along the Yellow River Bridge. Chen Cheng and Hao Mengling's divisions of the Central Army were able to recover Zhengzhou on the evening of the 6th. After Liu Zhi heard the news, he ordered Hao's division and Li's brigade to stay in Zhengzhou to maintain public order, while the remaining troops continued to advance north on the 7th. Commander-in-Chief Chiang went to Kaifeng on the 6th and also rushed to Zhengzhou on the 7th to reassure the people and ordered the armies to advance fiercely. (October 7th)</p>

<h3>Simpson is Attacked by Assassins</h3>
<p>▲Bealson Takes Over Tianjin Customs</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Yan Xishan previously appointed Simpson as the Customs Commissioner on June 16th. As of September 20th, a total of 2 million yuan was remitted to Taiyuan. On September 21st, the Northeast Army arrived in Tianjin, and the Shanghai Inspector General of Customs sent Ding Guitang to Tianjin to assist Jielson in taking over the customs. Simpson refused to comply. Ding then went out to visit Zhang Xueliang, who telegraphed Simpson to Shenyang on the 22nd, urging him to hand over the customs. Simpson then returned to Tianjin on the 25th to complete the handover preparations. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 1st of this month, he was suddenly attacked by thugs. The assailant is at large, and the motive is unknown. The circumstances of Simpson's attack and his admission to the hospital are described below:</p>
<p>Jielson, the New Customs Commissioner of Tianjin Customs</p>
<p>At 7:20 PM on the 1st of this month, Simpson was reading a newspaper in his room when three thugs suddenly arrived and presented a calling card with Fu Rulin's name on it, requesting to see him. Simpson, thinking that Fu Rulin was an acquaintance, immediately ordered the doorman to let them in. The three entered the reception room, and the doorman, as usual, turned around to close the door and leave. Simpson saw that Fu was not among the three and was about to express his surprise when one of them circled behind Simpson, his face suddenly turning pale and showing a fierce light. Simpson knew they were not good people and tried to turn around to retreat into the inner room. The thug fired two shots in succession. One bullet grazed his shoulder, and the other hit him squarely in the back. Simpson fell to the ground in response. The thugs rushed out the door and fled. Five minutes later, the doorman dared to come out to check. Simpson was lying on the ground and was still able to speak. He quickly ordered them to call the German-American Hospital and ask them to send a car quickly. At the same time, he reported to the police on duty and telegraphed the British and French Municipal Councils, asking them to assist in arresting the assailants. Simpson was admitted to the hospital at 7:40 PM and was treated by doctors Bell, Corliss, and Knott. As the bleeding did not stop, they used hemostatic techniques. Once the bleeding stopped, Simpson was able to sleep peacefully. On the morning of the 2nd, the doctors tried to remove the bullet, but could not find it anywhere. By noon, his temperature gradually increased, and fresh blood from the wound flowed out again. He became delirious and spoke incoherently at times. The doctors then used X-rays three times and finally discovered that the bullet had penetrated deep into his [unclear character] bone, which was broken. The bullet was very small, apparently a number four Browning bullet. The three German doctors did not dare to perform surgery and telegraphed Dr. Fox of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, a renowned doctor, who arrived in Tianjin on the evening train. After studying the situation, they were also unsure. They then telegraphed the Peking Union Medical College again, asking them to send a pathologist to Tianjin to jointly study a safe surgical procedure. As of 10:00 PM on the 3rd, after more than fifty hours, the bullet had still not been removed, the temperature had not decreased, and pus was flowing from the wound, indicating that the bullet was causing decay in the [unclear character] bone. Simpson's condition was very poor. If the bullet could be removed tonight (the 3rd) and there were no special changes in the next twenty-four hours, his life could be saved. However, since the [unclear character] bone was broken, his limbs would be paralyzed, and he would be a disabled person in the future even if he recovered completely.</p>
<p>Simpson's residence was located at 35 Zhongjie Street, in the Special District 1, at the intersection. There was a guard post at the entrance of the street. When the thugs fired the shots, the police at the guard post suspected they were bandits and did not dare to arrest them. However, they confirmed that the assailants had escaped in car T-517. The British Consul and the British, French, and Japanese Municipal Councils all attached great importance to this case and each sent full teams of detectives to intensify the search for the assailants. After three days, there was no progress. However, it has been found that car number seven belonged to the Huamei Car Company in the French Concession. The chauffeur, Jiang Yuheng, was arrested on the morning of the 2nd and sent to the British Municipal Council. According to his confession, at 6:50 PM on the 1st, he received a call from the Beiyang Hotel, saying that the guests in room 65 needed a car. Therefore, he drove car 517 to the Beiyang Hotel. The waiter on the third floor said that the guests had settled their room and meal expenses and could be asked for cash after they got out of the car. Soon, four people came downstairs, three wearing Zhongshan suits and one in plain clothes. One person sat next to me, and three sat behind me. They ordered me to drive towards the Ping'an Cinema in the British Concession. When passing the Qiangzi River Bridge, they turned to the old German Bridge and drove along the Haida Avenue. They turned into the Dickenson Road intersection and ordered me to turn to the corner of Zhongjie Street to park (i.e., Simpson's residence). The three people in the back got out of the car and entered the building on the east side of the street. The person in the front seat did not get out of the car and insisted that I not turn off the lights. After a short while, about four or five minutes, the three people ran out of the building, got into the car, and the person sitting next to me took out a gun and threatened me to drive south. At Tenth Road, I turned into Haida Avenue, passed Daguanmen, went along Qiangzi Road, to Seventeenth Road, and drove north into the French Concession. I went west on Thirty-second Road, passed Zhangzhuang Bridge, and then went north past the Catholic Church and stopped at Mingde Alley. The four people said together, "Turn off the lights. If you drive away immediately, I will shoot you dead." After saying this, they left a five-yuan banknote and got out of the car. The reporter also went to the Beiyang Hotel to investigate the assailants' actions. It was learned that on the afternoon of September 29th, five guests came to Tianjin from Dalian and stayed in rooms 59 and 65. Three people stayed in room 59, named Yu Jianqiu. Two people stayed in room 65, named Jin. Yu Jianqiu was about forty years old, from Hebei Province, with a dark and thin face, five feet tall, bald and without a beard, wearing a gray cloth gown, a gray American hat, and blue cloth shoes. Jin was also about forty years old, with a white and round face, seemingly ill, wearing a gray cloth jacket. Another person was over fifty years old, five feet five or six inches tall, with a yellow and thin face, high cheekbones, round and small eyes, and a yellow handlebar mustache. Another person was very young, only about twenty years old, five feet tall, with a white, square face. Another person was over thirty years old, with a red face, round at the top and pointed at the bottom, wearing a Mao Yue gown. All five people, except Yu Jianqiu, spoke with a Fengtian accent. The French Municipal Council and the Japanese Police Department once surrounded Mingde Alley and the Beiyang Hotel with a patrol and handgun team to conduct a search, but found nothing. In addition to sending a large number of detectives to investigate, the British Municipal Council also joined forces with Japanese and French Municipal Council detectives to guard the docks, train stations, and other places, paying attention to the appearance of the criminals and strictly arresting them.</p>
<p>Bei Lie, the Tianjin Customs Commissioner appointed by the Central Government, was ordered to close the customs on June 20th because he could not exercise his functions. Shortly thereafter, Bei Lie went south, and the Deputy Commissioner Jielson led the old customs officials to work at the Customs Club every day, but there was actually nothing to do. Everyone played billiards and chatted. In Bei Lie's opinion, this method was considered closing the customs, but in fact, the customs affairs were handled by Simpson without interruption. On the 2nd of this month, the Northeast sent Han Linsheng to take over the Tianjin Customs Superintendent. Jielson immediately visited Han to ask if he could return to the customs to work. Han said that since the Central Government had an order, he should obey it. Because Simpson was injured, he contacted the Deputy Commissioner Gu Ziyi (appointed by Yan), and Gu agreed to represent the handover. At 9:00 AM on the 3rd, Jielson led more than 200 old customs officials back to the customs to resume work. Customs Superintendent Han Linsheng also came to the scene to supervise the handover. No new customs officials came to the customs for fear of being detained. However, they left the keys to the various offices. The funds under Simpson's management were completely taken away. Gu Ziyi also did not come to the customs, only leaving the customs seal and taking away the key to the customs office. Fortunately, the old customs officials were all experienced and immediately resumed work. However, since the new customs officials had taken away the funds, Jielson and Han Linsheng jointly issued a notice stating that the customs had been closed on June 20th by order of the National Government and work had been stopped. Now, they were ordered to reopen the customs and would resume work on the same day (the 3rd) according to the customs regulations before June 20th of this year, in order to indicate that they could not be responsible for the customs revenue during Simpson's tenure. In order to care for the lower-level staff, a notice was issued, ordering the new customs officials to leave their posts immediately, while all weighers, patrol officers, sailors, messengers, and coolies were allowed to continue working. According to Jielson, Bei Lie would not be returning, and he had been ordered to act as Customs Commissioner. Since the funds under Simpson's management had been completely taken away, he could not acknowledge responsibility and would have to report to the Inspector General of Customs for instructions. According to Han Linsheng, he had come to supervise the handover to prevent the customs affairs from being interrupted. Now that he saw that the old customs officials had all resumed work, the situation was very good and he was deeply gratified. Some of the new customs officials came from Hong Kong and Shanghai. Since they were being dismissed, they would need a considerable amount of travel expenses, so they were given a full month's salary for October to show compassion. It was also heard that there were two keys to the customs office, and one was handed over to the British Consulate for safekeeping. If Gu Ziyi did not hand over the key, a letter would be sent to the British Consulate asking them to hand over the key in their possession so that work could resume. (October 3rd)</p>

<p>Collection of Road Tolls in Cash for Various Districts and Counties: The construction of roads was undertaken last year by the first, second, and third district public offices along the way, who collected labor from households and filled in the roadbeds. Now, the county government, based on the Construction Bureau's calculations of the labor and cash equivalents, has determined that the total earthwork for the entire road is 27,898 cubic meters. Dividing this by the total number of households required to provide labor, each household should have provided five days of labor. At a daily wage of 50 cents, each household should contribute $2.50. It has been found that the first district has 1,647 households subject to labor service, requiring a cash payment of $4,117.50. The second district has 230 households subject to labor service, requiring a cash payment of $575, etc. This information has been submitted to the Construction Department for approval and has been ordered by the county government to the relevant district public offices to commence collection and remittance immediately.</p>
<p>Farmers in Shanyang Robbed: At the home of farmer Zhu Yunhua in Maqiao, southwest of Shanyang County, more than ten armed bandits suddenly arrived on the night of the first of this month. They pried open the door, silenced the householders, and proceeded to rob at will. After the robbery, they fled with their loot. On the morning of the second, the householders reported the incident to the Second Squad of the Shanyang Police and the Fourth Brigade of the Jiangsu Province Anti-Smuggling Unit, requesting an investigation and arrest.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Suzhou Customs Burns Opium: The Suzhou Customs Supervisory Office has scheduled to publicly burn 280 "jies" of fake opium, 136 taels of opium paste, and 78 opium pipes seized from July to September at Xuanmiao Temple at 10:00 AM this morning (the 9th).</p>
<p>Iron Loom Industry Asks for Exemption from Export Tax: The Suzhou County Iron Loom Silk Weaving Industry Guild, citing the prevalence of foreign goods and the declining sales of domestic silk, intends to follow the precedent set by Zhejiang Province in exempting newly designed electric loom silk fabrics from cargo tax in order to resist foreign competition. They have submitted separate reports to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Construction Department for approval. After receiving the reports, the Ministry and Department will instruct the Financial Special Commissioner's Office to instruct the Silk Fabric Special Tax Bureau to review the matter. According to the reply, the Zhejiang tax exemption proposal originally referred to factories using the latest European and American electric looms. Currently, there are no such factories in Zhejiang Province sufficient to qualify for exemption, so it has not been implemented. Therefore, the Suzhou merchants' request for exemption is fundamentally untenable. However, in order to promote industry, officials have been sent to Suzhou to investigate whether there are any factories using new electric looms for weaving before further deliberation.</p>
<p>Kidnapping Case Appeals Court Hearing: Gao Fengyuan, a 23-year-old employee of the YMCA of the Navy on North Sichuan Road in the city, through matchmakers Zhang Jiu and Liu Songting, introduced Longzhu (age 16), the daughter of Li Hua, a resident of Yinghua Lane in Caojiadu, as his wife on the 16th day of the ninth lunar month of last year. On July 31st of this year, Gao, because his mother, Gao Gao, urgently needed to return to her hometown, discussed the matter with the original matchmaker and Li Hua, intending to take Longzhu back to their hometown for the wedding. Li Hua refused, so Gao colluded with his cohabitants Jin Liu and Dong Jiang, hired a car, and drove to Caojiadu to forcibly marry Longzhu and take her home. The incident was spotted by a patrol officer, who apprehended Gao and others and sent them to the District Court. On August 13th, Dong and Jiang were found not guilty, while Gao Fengyuan was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for obstructing family affairs, and Jin Liu was sentenced to six months. Both were dissatisfied with the verdict and appealed to the High Court. Yesterday (the 8th), the presiding judge of the Second Criminal Division of the High Court, Zheng Chi, accompanied by prosecutor Sun Xi, presided over the hearing. After the court debate concluded, the verdict was scheduled to be announced on the afternoon of the 14th of this month. Gao Fengyuan and Jin Liu were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Anti-Smuggling Camp Seizes a Large Quantity of Opium: The Tenth Brigade of the Anti-Smuggling Camp of Suzhou Prefecture is stationed in Chenjiashi outside Xiaodongmen in this county. The day before yesterday (the 6th), Shao, the captain of the No. 1 patrol boat permanently stationed in Jiangyin, led his team to Changshu to collect their September salaries from Commander Jiang. After meeting with Commander Jiang, they learned that the salaries had already been remitted to Jiangyin. After Shao and his men left, they were drinking in a small tavern near the camp, preparing to return the next morning. Around 5:00 PM, two sand boats suddenly came from the north in the Chenjiashi River and passed by the camp. The boats were ostensibly full of firewood and other fuel, but many of the crew members appeared uneasy. Captain Shao and his men saw that their actions were suspicious and immediately ordered the boats to stop and be inspected. They suddenly discovered a large quantity of opium bricks under the firewood pile. Upon seeing this, the boatmen all fled ashore. As a result, more than two hundred packs of opium bricks were seized, each pack weighing about one catty. They were all wrapped in oiled paper. The boatmen, Qin Lao San and Yang Lao Da, both from Jingjiang, were about twenty years old. The witnesses at the time were brought to the brigade headquarters along with the boats, which were detained. That evening, Commander Jiang telegraphed the Shanghai General Headquarters and also sent Chen Zibo, the first brigade commander, to Shanghai yesterday morning (the 7th) to report and request instructions. Sixteen Suspected Thieves Released on Bail: Gu Er, a resident of Tangnan outside Xiaodongmen in this county, reported to the Second Police Station last month that there were thieves in Liandunbang and offered to lead them to capture them. Subsequently, the police arrested sixteen suspected thieves, including Wang Kaixian, in the Chang'an Tea House and sent them to the Justice Office. After repeated separate interrogations, Wang and others claimed to be Yi artisans and had not engaged in theft. However, the plaintiff, Gu Er, insisted that the older man (namely, Wang Kaixian) was the one who robbed his boat. It has now been learned that the suspects are all from Lishui County. Recently, people from their hometown have submitted petitions to the county government, proving that Wang and others are legitimate merchants. The day before yesterday, Wang Jinxi, the town chief of Sanyang Town in the county, and citizens Zhu Zhaolong and Zhang Chenghong, submitted a statement stating that Wang Kaixian and others are indeed law-abiding citizens and have been mistakenly accused of theft by Gu Er, requesting the county to grant bail for investigation. The county government then interrogated the plaintiff, Gu Er, again yesterday afternoon (the 7th). Gu Er still claimed as before, but the identified stolen goods did not match. As a result, the officials ordered Wang and the other sixteen to provide a reliable guarantee, and Gu Er also provided a guarantee, pending further investigation. After the release, the bailiffs removed the shackles from Wang Kaixian and others. Subsequently, Yichang and Hengchang Coal Companies in Xiaodongmen provided guarantees for their release.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Lake Bandits Rob Five Homes and Kidnap Seven People: Robberies have been rampant in Wuxi in recent days. The news that lake bandits robbed five homes and kidnapped seven people in the Dengjiawan and Xiaoqiaotou towns bordering Jingyun and Taibo in one night is nothing short of a shocking case. The details are recorded below: (1) Xiaoqiaotou Town, where the second (Jingyun) and twelfth (Taibo) districts intersect, is located north of the Jiaqiao Bridge, belonging to the third, fifth, and fourth and fifth "tus" of Taibo, and has dozens of shops and residences. Dengjiawan, located south of the bridge and belonging to the sixth and fourth "tu," has fewer residents and is only three li from Meicun Town. After 8:00 PM the night before last, more than fifty lake bandits in five small boats first robbed the home of Ling Azhang in Dengjiawan. After entering the house and searching briefly, they tied up Azhang and handed him over to two bandits to be taken back to the bandit boat to guard him. Next, they robbed the home of Azhang's younger brother, Ling Renda. Renda had been robbed once last winter and was already a frightened bird upon hearing the bandit alarm. He initially tried to escape, but the front and back doors were guarded by the bandits. He tried to break out, but a bandit with a gun grabbed him and tied him up along with his son, Jiansheng, and handed them over to the bandits to be taken back to the boat and guarded with Azhang. After robbing five homes and kidnapping three people, the bandits then led their men across Wangjia Bridge to Xiaoqiaotou Town to rob. (2) After the bandits arrived in town, they deployed to various strategic locations to guard. First, they went to Zhen Hengxing Grocery Store. The owner, Shen Genhu, was terrified and wanted to escape, but he was caught. After repeated pleading, he was released. At the same time, Sanmao Grocery Store, located next to Shen Hengxing, was also broken into by the bandits, who chased the owner, You Junde, over the roof to the back of Shen Hengxing's house, where they caught him and escorted him back to the bandit boat. Then they searched the room of Junde's younger sister, Rendi, for a long time. Rendi was young and beautiful and was kidnapped by the bandits along with Junde's wife, Ling Baoxian. After the bandits left Sanmao, they went to the home of Ling Azhang's third younger brother, Yuanshun, and searched the house, kidnapping Yuanshun's thirteen-year-old daughter, Asan. Before leaving, the bandits saw that Yuanshun's daughter-in-law was holding a child in her arms and intended to kidnap them as well. However, they reached under her and realized it was a girl, so they threw her back on the bed, loudly proclaiming, "We don't want girls!" Then they took the loot and went down to the boat at their leisure and left. The bandits were quite organized and did not seem to be a temporary group. Most of them were dressed in black, wearing duckbill caps, and several were wearing military uniforms, commanding from the middle. The weapons they carried included five Enfield rifles, pistols, and Mauser pistols, one for each person. They moved very quickly, robbing five homes in succession, kidnapping a total of seven men and women. The whole process took only one hour. After the robbery was completed, they blew a whistle to gather and count the number of people, took the loot to Wangjia Bridge, boarded the bandit boat, and headed towards Lake Taihu.</p>
<p>Shipping Companies Attempt to Fix the Barn Door After the Horses Have Bolted: After the Xinli, Cheng, and Shan small steamers of the Wuxi Merchants and Yangxian Companies were completely robbed by lake bandits at Jiulikou, the various shipping companies became wary and had to urgently seek post-disaster remedies. Yesterday, the managers of various companies, including Merchants, China, New Merchants, and Yonggu, met at the Shipping Guild to discuss protection methods. It was decided that each company would jointly send a letter to the county government and the water police district, requesting that six police officers be assigned to each ship every day to protect them.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Lake Bandits Intercept Two Ships: It has been further reported that the Xinjiangshun steamship of the Wujin Merchants Bureau was traveling from Liyang to Changzhou at around 7:00 AM on the 5th when it was intercepted by lake bandits at Pinglilkou. At the same time, the Yangxian Guoshan steamship, also traveling from Zhangzhu, arrived at the same location and was also robbed. These events were reported in the previous two editions of the newspaper. Now it is learned that the Xinjiangshun steamship of the Merchants Bureau returned to Changzhou from Liyang carrying passengers at around 5:00 PM on the 6th. According to the ship's purser, Bu Quansheng, the bandits were all well-dressed. Two people were injured by bullets during the robbery: one was an actor performing in Liyang, and the other was a passerby on the shore. Both were injured in the thigh. The Xinjiangshun lost $500 in cash from various businesses, and the Guoshan's owner, Mr. Wang, lost $3,000, not including the losses of the passengers. Moreover, the bandits' target was not the Xinjiangshun and Guoshan but the Yonggu steamship, which was traveling from Liyang. The bandits had learned that the Yonggu steamship was carrying approximately $30,000 in goods and cash entrusted by merchants in Wuxi. The Yonggu usually departs earlier than the Xinjiangshun. However, on that day, recruiting officers were present, and the Yonggu was delayed, causing the Xinjiangshun to depart first and bear the brunt of the attack. Subsequently, the Yonggu arrived and, seeing the robbery ahead, immediately turned around and fled. The bandits forced the Xinjiangshun steamship's "laogui" (engineer) to accelerate and chase after them, but the "laogui" secretly delayed the speed, allowing the Yonggu to escape. The kidnapped "meat tickets" were all released in the Luobu Mountains.</p>

The robbery lasted for two hours before the bandits left with their loot, and the losses were quite significant.</p>

<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>The East Pagoda Has Been Completed: By order of the Department of Civil Affairs, the Tang Dynasty-built Baoxing Twin Pagodas of Deyisi Temple are being repaired through private donations. This pagoda is said to be 997 years old. Its construction period was even before the Xie Peak Pagoda in West Lake. A few days ago, unscrupulous local elements attempted to dismantle and sell the bricks for a few dozen yuan. Fortunately, the Department ordered its preservation, and the ancient artifact remains as it was, newly renovated. Yesterday was the completion date of the East Pagoda. Lu's descendants placed the relics donated by Lu Huisheng and various scriptures handwritten by various lay Buddhists into a wooden box. This occurred at 7:30 AM, and there were many spectators. It was originally planned that County Magistrate Shen would personally supervise the event, but the day before, an opposition party petitioned the county, requesting that the entire Miaofa Lotus Sutra handwritten by the eldest son of Lu Zhuangjian, the former Minister of Personnel of the Ming Dynasty, be postponed from being placed into the pagoda. The county magistrate then waited for a meeting before choosing an auspicious day to hold the ceremony. The West Pagoda will also continue to be built.</p>

<h3>The Process of Representatives of Labor University Petitioning in Beijing</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Labor University student representatives Pei Kun and Zhan Chunji went to Beijing to petition for the appointment of a new president, as reported yesterday. The two representatives went to the National Government yesterday morning to visit Gu Yingfen, who was not there. They were received by Zhu Wenzhong, the secretary of the National Government, who accepted their petition and presented the current situation of the university and the outside world's misunderstanding of labor education. They expressed their hope that the National Government would pay special attention to this highest institution of labor learning in the country and maintain it. Secretary Zhu expressed sympathy and promised to forward this intention to the National Government.

<h3>New News from Soochow University in Suzhou</h3>
<p>▲ The Surge in the Number of Male and Female Students: The number of students at Soochow University and its affiliated First High School in Suzhou has surged this year. The high school department has already met its quota, which is the highest record in history. The two departments have a total of 812 people, and the number of female students has increased to 72.

<h3>Review of the Boy Scout Proclamation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Training Department issued a proclamation to all Shanghai Boy Scouts for the Double Tenth National Day Grand Review of the 19th year, saying, "How gratifying it is for us to hold this Shanghai Boy Scout Grand Review amidst the cheers of the masses and the national jubilation on this National Day! We cannot help but have some thoughts on this. Because of our country's economic backwardness, we lag behind in everything, and the Boy Scout movement is no exception. Compared with European and American countries, we cannot help but feel ashamed. The British Boy Scout movement was founded only twenty years ago, but the national number has exceeded 600,000. The United States has a history of Boy Scouts that is only three or four years longer than that of Britain, but the number now reaches more than 800,000. What about the situation of Boy Scouts in our country? Our country has a history of Boy Scouts that is almost twenty years old, but the total number in the country is still less than 50,000. At the same time, in terms of work performance, internal organization, and training of team members, we are far behind the progress of European and American countries. This is of course due to the lack of effort on the part of the Boy Scouts themselves, and the ineffectiveness of the leaders' leadership. The economic difficulties and the indifference of the social community are also considerable reasons. Therefore, if we want to hope for the development of the Boy Scout movement, on the one hand, we must try our best to break through the economic difficulties, and on the other hand, we must ask for the enthusiastic support of the social community. The most important thing is the efforts of the Boy Scouts themselves and the leaders' effective leadership.</p>
<p>Since the first National Boy Scout Grand Review of China, the Boy Scout movement in China has been booming and has shown a rapid momentum. Because in this National Grand Review, the organizers of Boy Scouts in various regions have received many good guidance, such as the standards of organization, the direction of training, and the progress of work, have all received a correct instruction. The organization has gradually become strict and orderly, and the training has gradually become unified and centralized. Moreover, not only the Boy Scout side has had a new life, but the society has also had a universal concept of promoting and developing the Boy Scouts. The situation in Shanghai is also the same. In the past, because Shanghai Boy Scouts did not have a leading organization or a central organization, there were differences of opinion and each went its own way. Therefore, the Boy Scout movement could not easily make significant progress. Since the central government has a unified Boy Scout organization, the Boy Scouts in various regions are like the rivers of the Jiang, Han, and Huai, which can each be subordinated and converge into the sea. Since everyone participated in the first National Grand Review, everyone deeply felt the mistakes of the previous views and had to quickly contribute their energy and opinions to the entire Shanghai Boy Scout movement. As a result, the scene of Shanghai Boy Scouts has gradually reached a state of integrity and unity from the tragic state of being fragmented. Everyone's opinions have been eliminated, and there are no more meaningless disputes. Therefore, the central organization of Shanghai Boy Scouts, the Council, has emerged as a result. We firmly believe that since the emergence of this central organization council, our Shanghai Boy Scout movement will surely develop and progress more vigorously.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the importance of the Boy Scout movement in words, but not many people truly recognize the importance of the Boy Scout movement. This is not only the case for ordinary people in society, but the Boy Scouts themselves inevitably have divergent views. Because although the Boy Scouts have their universality, they also have their own national character. The development of these two characteristics must maintain their harmonious relationship. In other words, internally, it must adapt to the relationship between the country and the nation, and externally, it must adapt to the relationship with the world and mankind. Since the national status is different from each other, the Boy Scout training cannot abandon its national character. At this time, the Chinese nation is still in a period of being oppressed and invaded. At this time, the Chinese nation is in a period of revolutionary struggle. How important is the organization and training relationship of the Boy Scouts, which is the core of the nation? It is not enough to adapt to the entire nation's relationship and implement a consistent policy of national education without the leadership of the government. We remember that Commander-in-Chief Chiang had a lot of valuable things to tell us during the first Grand Review: "Everyone in the twentieth century should be a member of society and an independent person. If a person is isolated and acts alone, and is separated from society, he cannot maintain his survival. If a person relies on others and is parasitic on society, he cannot maintain his survival for a long time. Being able to manage one's own life with one's own strength is independence. Being able to serve society with one's own strength is being a member of society. Therefore, the goal of Boy Scout training is to create independent people and members of society."</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Chiang also told us, "The most important thing is the spirit of solidarity. If every member of a Boy Scout leaves his group, he will lose his function, and at the same time, his group will reduce one point of strength. Therefore, the group life of the Boy Scouts is organic and extremely close. If human society can reach this state, it will definitely be very developed and advanced." Connecting these two paragraphs, we can know the educational purpose of the Three Principles of the People, and we can also know the training plan of the Boy Scouts. Then, how close is the relationship between the Boy Scouts and the society? How important is the mission of the Boy Scouts? The meaning of these two paragraphs reveals the true meaning of mutual assistance and solidarity that human beings should have. At the same time, it tells us that the Boy Scouts should be the model for human beings and the model for human beings. Therefore, we say that the Boy Scouts are the core of the nation and the backbone of mankind. In national training, it is a model organization. Because the Chinese people are like a plate of loose sand, if the Boy Scout movement can develop and expand, then the inferior roots of the Chinese nation may be transformed as a result. The dawn of the future of the Chinese nation may be the dawn that begins with the Boy Scout movement. All authorities and members of the Boy Scouts in this city should deeply understand the meaning of this and put it into practice. Then, not only will all the unnecessary diversions of the past disappear, but everyone will love each other, be open and honest, and work together to seek the difficult steps of the Shanghai Boy Scout movement. Then, the glory of the future is right in front of us.</p>
<p>In the current revolutionary process, the mission of the Boy Scouts under the rule of the party is particularly important compared with the Boy Scouts of other countries, as mentioned above. Therefore, if we want to complete our mission, we must follow the instructions of Commander-in-Chief Chiang in the first National Grand Review: "The ideology must be pure, and we must not be shaken by heresies other than the Three Principles of the People. The motivation must be pure, and we must not be blinded by any dirty and opportunistic psychology. We must have the spirit of self-improvement and self-reliance, and the perseverance to endure hardship and be hard-working. We must not pursue external vanity, but should seek inner fulfillment." Shanghai is the essence of the country, and its culture is concentrated. Every move affects the country, so we can know how important our responsibility is. We only have to constantly warn ourselves and encourage ourselves, and abide by all the creeds of the Boy Scouts, in order to shoulder all the difficult and huge responsibilities.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the Boy Scout movement in Shanghai will gradually develop and expand with the original members as seeds. We must pray that the organization of the Boy Scouts will be popularized in all circles of Shanghai. In the Grand Review of the Double Tenth Festival next year, the number can be five times, ten times, or even countless times the number of this year. At the same time, the work, organization, and training of the Boy Scouts can all move forward with the times, so as not to lose our hard work and the meaning of the review on this Double Tenth Festival. Let us jointly shout two slogans: "Long live the Republic of China! Long live the Chinese Kuomintang! Long live the Chinese Boy Scouts! Long live the Shanghai Boy Scouts!"</p>

<h3>Primary School Party Ideology Test Scores</h3>
<p>▲A total of 337 schools▲10,317 people</p>
<p>(Kuomintang News Agency) The Training Department of the Shanghai Special City Party Department held the third Primary School Party Ideology Education Celebration and the Primary School Party Ideology Test at the same time. It stipulated that the test should be limited to fourth-grade students of each primary school, and detailed methods were formulated to order the training committees of each district party department to be responsible for handling it. It has been completed one after another, with a total of 337 schools tested and 10,317 students tested. The average score of each school has also been calculated. It is heard that very few people have achieved excellent results in this test. The reason, in addition to being directly related to teaching and training, is also a major reason for the inconsistency of the textbooks used. Since the depth of the content is different and the scope is different, if the test is to achieve comparable results, it is necessary to integrate the Party Ideology textbooks commonly used by each school to make the questions, so that some of the things have been taught and some have not been taught. Therefore, the level of the test results cannot be used as a standard, but only shows the general situation. The scores of each school (calculated as a percentage) published by the department are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Those with 70% or more: 53 schools including Leyi, Yude, Xinmin (Municipal), Yongxing, Huadanwanbei, Zhendong, Xiaofan, Pengpu, Zhuyin, Jihan, Beiqu, Xiaodong, Delin Zhixin, Tongsi, Dexin, Shinan, Caotang, Gaochang, Zhennan, Peiying, Sanxiu, Yueqiao, Jingli, Chencang, Gaoxing, Duchuan, Xiangdao, Ningbo Township First Public School Qianghua, Jingye, Jiazi, Zhiming Gongbei, Ningbo Township Second Primary School, Jingcheng, Wandou, Chongde, Xunyu, Chengbi, Jingting, Demao, Qunyi, Dongming, Zhongshan, Yongning, Zhabei, Meilong, Chunyi, Zijin, Yafeng, Shibie,</p>

<h3>Measures for Examining the Grades of Primary and Secondary Schools</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau believes that the methods for examining the grades of students in primary and secondary schools in this city are determined by each school and are not consistent. It is difficult to summarize the grades of each school and carry out academic statistics. It is necessary to stipulate and promulgate these examination methods. Therefore, it has drafted the Shanghai Primary and Secondary School Grade Examination Methods, which are divided into (1) examination period, (2) examination method, (3) score calculation method for each subject, (4) total score calculation method, (5) grade retention method, (6) graduation method. The clauses are clear and complete, and have been submitted to the municipal government for approval.</p>
<h3>Hideo Yokota Visits the College of Law and Politics</h3>
<p>Dr. Hideo Yokota, President of Meiji University in Japan, is an expert in Japanese civil law and former President of the Japanese Supreme Court.

Yesterday afternoon at 2:00, he accompanied Professor Akagami of Sociology and Professor Shi'o of Economics to visit the Shanghai College of Law and Politics on Jin Shenfu Road in this city. Zhu Foding, the Dean of the College, and Professors Gao Yihan, Li Da, Zhou Xinmin, Huang Tong, and Jiang Pan respectively received them, and all the students of the College held a meeting to welcome them in order to promote friendly relations. President Yokota Hideo, Professor Akagami, Professor Shi'o, etc. gave speeches at the welcome meeting on issues such as "Mutual Assistance and Development of Sino-Japanese Culture and Future Efforts." President Yokota praised the progress of Chinese civil law legislation and strongly advocated the abolition of consular jurisdiction. Jiang Pan and Huang Tong, Japanese professors of the College, translated. Then, a group photo was taken in the College to commemorate the occasion. He left at about 5:00 in the afternoon and had to go to Nanjing that evening.</p>

<h3>East China Basketball Team Wins Again</h3>
<p>▲Yesterday defeated Guanghua with a score of 46 to 36</p>

Yesterday afternoon, the team led its troops to the Daxi Road again and defeated Guanghua University with a score of 46 to 36.</p>
<p>Guanghua athletes have been working hard in training since autumn and have already acquired some skills. The generals of East China are stars on the sea, but because they are not accustomed to foreign fields, they have not been able to fully display their strengths. Therefore, the competition situation is extremely balanced. In the first half, East China won with a score of 18 to 15. In the second half, Guanghua took the lead with a score of 21 to 18. The total result was 36 points each, and the victory was not determined. The scores were equal, so the game was extended for five minutes to determine the final outcome. The East China team used its rich experience, stepped up its precautions, and used ingenious tactics to disrupt the Guanghua front. Lu Zhongen, Fu Wuqiao, and Liang Guoquan made contributions one after another and scored a total of five goals. Guanghua made no achievements and finally won the victory to East China. The score was 46 to 36.</p>

<p>The Fudan United Sports Association is a combination of sports-loving comrades from Fudan University. The organization is complete.

<p>Shanghai Third Session</p>
<h3>National Products Sports Meet</h3>
<p>Second Day Report</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the third Shanghai National Products Sports Meet. Starting at 3 PM, Mr. Pan Yangyao of the China Vocational Education Society was invited to give a speech, followed by entertainment. The various situations are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Pan Yangyao's Speech (Abridged): "Today is the second day of the third Shanghai National Products Sports Meet. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau invited a celebrity to give a speech. I originally had nothing to say, but since I'm here, I can't help but offer a few words. My topic is 'Promoting National Products and the Life and Death of the People,' because the most serious problem in society now is the unemployment problem. Many people cannot find jobs. As today's newspaper reported, there is a person surnamed Wei whose wife died in the Huangpu River due to unemployment. Although he himself has been rescued, we still feel very sorry. The unemployment problem is so serious that we should be aware of it. Although foreign countries are also facing unemployment problems, it is because of overproduction. We in China are facing unemployment because everyone uses foreign goods. Because everyone uses foreign goods, it has led to many unemployed people. In other words, that person surnamed Wei was killed by people who use foreign goods. Now, the talented people in China are being used by foreigners, and we still want to use foreign goods. Look at what we eat, wear, and use. There are very few domestic products. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau wants to hold this National Products Sports Meet to encourage everyone not to use foreign goods, so that domestic products can be revitalized and the number of unemployed people can be reduced, so that there will be no more people like Wei yesterday. The method of promoting domestic products should be divided into three levels. The first level is the responsibility of women. Because most of what they eat, wear, and use are purchased by women, especially cosmetics and household items. Women should bear the main responsibility. British cloth factories realize this, so they once declared that if every woman's skirt could be made of domestic products, their factory would not only not fail, but would definitely be very prosperous. The second level is that factory owners must take responsibility. Don't only think about personal interests, but also think about ways to solve the unemployment problem of many people, that is, to revitalize domestic products. Recently, 106 silk factories in Shanghai have closed down. Each factory has an average of more than 300 workers. After these 30,000 people become unemployed, where can they be placed? Naturally, the weak will commit suicide like that person surnamed Wei, and the strong will become robbers, kidnappers, bandits, and hooligans. If domestic products are revitalized, there will be fewer bad things and unemployed people in society. The third level is to hope that workers also take responsibility. They must understand that they are not making money for the factory owner, or making a living for themselves, but thinking about whether their products can surpass foreign goods. That is, don't only think about your own meal, but think about being able to help many unemployed people. In the future, everyone will have food to eat. The so-called labor-capital cooperation, workers work hard and improve their work. At that time, the effectiveness of workers is greater than that of capitalists. Shop assistants who serve in stores should also have this kind of heart and spirit, and want to have food to eat, and everyone else also has food to eat. I will say one more sentence, which is to promote domestic products. Consumers should be responsible by housewives, capital should be responsible by factory owners, and labor should be responsible by workers. As for the general public who go to buy things, they should also pay attention to buying domestic products. For example, if you buy a box of matches, if it is the Phoenix brand, you would rather take it off and change it. Now, stores often covet the high interest of foreign goods and deliberately promote foreign goods. Stores only know that foreign goods have high interest, but they don't know that this increases the number of unemployed people in the country. Therefore, whether we buy a toothbrush, a pack of toothpaste, or a washbasin, we want domestic products. This is the spirit and responsibility of promoting domestic products. The most painful thing is that we in China, not to mention what we wear, use, and eat, most of them are foreign goods. Even rice has to be eaten from foreign countries, and Japanese rice is also imported into China. Isn't this extremely dangerous? Japan is a small country, and it is not a country that relies on agriculture. He still has a source of rice to send over to feed the Chinese people. How can this be justified? Therefore, promoting domestic products is a major issue concerning the life and death of the people. I won't say much now. In short, promoting domestic products is to make everyone know that it is the responsibility of every Chinese person."</p>
<p>▲ Entertainment at the Conference: Every day from 1 PM to 6 PM, entertainment will be held in the Flower World on the upper floor of the National United Department Store. Admission is by ticket only. Anyone who purchases 50 cents worth of goods in the shopping mall will receive a ticket, or a letter can be sent to the Social Affairs Bureau, Xiaonanmen, Nanshi, to request them, but each letter is limited to a maximum of ten tickets. After 6 PM, the world will still be managed according to its rules.</p>
<p>▲ Banners Across the Street: During this National Products Movement Week, banners are hung across the street in 18 locations in the city, including Xiaoximen, Laobeimen, Dongjiadu, Shiliupu, Dadongmen, Xiaodongmen, Xiaonanmen, Laoximen, Xinbeimen, Fangbang Road, Sports Ground, Hengfeng Bridge, Xinzha Bridge, Wuzhen Bridge, Menggu Road Intersection, Baoshan Road Intersection, North Railway Station, North Sichuan Road, and Qiujiang Road Intersection. The wording is quite cautionary. Select and record: (1) Promoting national products is the fundamental policy of enriching the country and the people; (2) The national products movement is a national salvation movement; (3) Factories should produce more national products; (4) Using foreign goods results in an outflow of 120,000 yuan every year; (5) The more foreign goods are sold, the poorer China becomes; (6) Promoting national products requires practical and lasting preparation; (7) Promoting national products is the way out of the current economic difficulties; (8) Buying and selling one penny of foreign goods means sacrificing one cent of the nation's vitality; (9) What is so beautiful about wearing foreign goods?; (10) Overthrow counterfeit domestic goods; (11) Wearing clothes made of domestic fabrics is both beautiful and patriotic, etc., which can be described as morning bells and evening drums, which are thought-provoking.</p>
<p>▲ Samples on Display: Dahua Woolen Mill sent more than 30 kinds of woolen samples, with bright colors and exquisite beauty. They are truly superior domestic products. They have now been sent to the city's National Products Exhibition Hall for display.</p>

<h3>Collision Between Ships on the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>▲ No Injuries</p>
<p>The Ning-Shao Company's Shanghai-Ningbo liner "Xin Ning-Shao" left Shanghai port yesterday at 5:15 PM to sail to Ningbo. While sailing in the river in front of the Swire Company wharf, it collided with the "Shengjing" ship and the British warship "Comforthwell", resulting in damage to both ships. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>▲ Cause of the Accident: The "Xin Ning-Shao" ship was full of passengers heading to Ningbo yesterday. When it departed from the Nanshi wharf and sailed near Lujiazui, the tide was falling. Therefore, when passing through the river in front of Swire Company's New Beijing wharf, it happened to encounter the company's Yangtze River ship "Shengjing" in the harbor, turning around to dock. The stern of the "Shengjing" protruded into the river. When the "Xin Ning-Shao" saw this situation, it tried to avoid it, but collided with the stern of the "Shengjing". Fortunately, both ships reversed, so the damage was minor. The "Shengjing" ship was still able to load cargo as usual.</p>
<p>▲ Collision with British Warship: The British warship "Comforthwell" was anchored in front of the Swire wharf. When the "Xin Ning-Shao" sailed to that location, it was proceeding against the falling tide. Because the "Shengjing" ship's body blocked the river, the waterway was also obscured. The owner of the "Xin Ning-Shao", Xin Jixiang, realized that the river was flowing very rapidly and that it would collide with the British warship, causing a major disaster. He quickly ordered the driver to "turn hard to port" and pass through the river channel to avoid a head-on collision with the British warship. Fortunately, the port rudder was quick enough to break the anchor chain of the British warship, and the anchor was lost. The bow of the British warship turned eastward, colliding with the starboard bow of the "Xin Ning-Shao". Both sides were damaged.</p>
<p>▲ Damage to Warship and Liner: The nose of the bow of the British warship was broken by the "Xin Ning-Shao", forming a large hole of about one foot square. The black line on the starboard bow of the "Xin Ning-Shao" was also hit by the bow of the British warship, forming a hole. After the accident, the "Xin Ning-Shao" returned to the wharf and reported to the company. The owner, Xin Jixiang, personally went to the British warship to inspect the damage in order to negotiate repairs. The stern of the "Shengjing" ship was only slightly damaged. At the time of the collision, none of the warship or liner crew or passengers were injured.</p>
<p>▲ Delayed Departure: The "Xin Ning-Shao" ship, having obtained a bucket of cement from the company from the owner, temporarily repaired the damage on board. Because it did not affect the draft, it was still ordered to sail to Ningbo. However, due to contact with the captain of the British warship, the departure was delayed until 8 PM, when it finally left Shanghai. The issue of responsibility for the collision still needs to be investigated before it can be clarified.</p>

The general idea was that the Japanese educator and jurist Dr. Hideo Yokota and his wife, as well as Mr. Akagami, Mr. Shio, and Mr. Onishi, came to our country to investigate education and judicial conditions, and to visit students who have returned to the country. We have graduated from being educated by teachers for more than ten years or several years, and now that teachers are coming to Shanghai, we are holding a welcome meeting in particular. We hope that teachers will dedicate their education and research to China, so that China can learn from it, and China's education sector will benefit greatly. Moreover, since the National Government of our country has established its capital in Nanjing, it has repeatedly promulgated new laws, established courts, and improved prisons, sparing no effort. The progress of the judiciary of our Republic of China has been rapid. Afterwards, students gave speeches in succession, and presented Dr. Yokota and his wife with flower baskets. The doctor stood up to give a reply, which was mainly to thank the students for their kindness, and to report on the current situation of Meiji University. There was a great deal of drinking and socializing. Photos were taken and the event dispersed.</p>

<h3>Hu Fuzhang Has Symptoms of Mental Illness</h3>
<p>▲ His Uncle Testified in Court</p>
<p>▲ The Judge Ordered a Forensic Medical Examination</p>
<p>Hu Aji from Shaoxing, residing at No. 187 Changkang Lane, Alabaster Road, has been working as a Chinese constable, No. 526, at Sandao Wharf in the Hongkou Police Station for more than 30 years. His son, Hu Fuzhang, does not engage in proper work and associates with the dregs of society. At 7:40 p.m. on the 30th of last month, he hid a sharp knife and suddenly went to the entrance of his residence, intending to kill his mother, Hu Ma. He was knocked down by Hu Aji using a door bolt, who seized the kitchen knife and reported it to the detectives. He was detained by the police station and sent to the Special District Local Court. Because Fuzhang denied that Hu Ma was his mother, the judge ordered a further hearing with evidence. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning was the date of the continued hearing. The police station sent Fuzhang to the Second Criminal Division. The presiding judge, Wu Tingqi, opened the court. After the police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, presented the case, he said that the witnesses in the case had arrived in court and requested a hearing. Hu Ruibao testified that he lived on Guangfu Road in Zhabei and worked for the water company. Hu Aji is my elder brother, and Fuzhang is my nephew. Ma is definitely his biological mother, but he has always had symptoms of mental illness, which occur every few months. On the 30th of last month, Fuzhang came to my house for dinner. While drinking, he looked unhappy and sighed frequently. At that time, the lights went out, and Fuzhang angrily left through the back door to go home. I was worried that he would have a relapse and cause trouble, so I quickly sent my cousin A Kun to report to my brother's house, and I followed. I saw that Fuzhang had already been arrested and detained, and I saw a kitchen knife. The knife belongs to my family. I don't know when Fuzhang took it. Hu A Kun also testified to everything. The defendant stated that he suffered from mental illness, which occurred every six months or a year. Ma is definitely my biological mother. That night, because I drank too much, I had a relapse, so I can't remember what I did. I don't know where the knife came from. Hu Aji filed a case, requesting that his son be taken back so that he could be taken to the countryside for treatment. Judge Wu reviewed the statements and ordered the defendant to be detained pending a forensic medical examination to determine whether he had mental illness.</p>
<h3>A Patient Died Mid-Journey</h3>
<p>▲ Died in a Rickshaw</p>

He was sent to the Fei Lun Road mortuary for examination.</p>
<h3>A Man and Woman Eloped and Lived Together</h3>
<p>▲ Parents Filed a Lawsuit</p>
<p>▲ Limited Time for Reconciliation</p>
<p>Gao Linbao, also known as Yun'e, the 18-year-old daughter of Gao Liansheng from Changzhou, residing at No. 56 Ruifu Lane, Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, was studying at the Catholic Church School and boarding there. Recently, she fell in love with Jiang Yundiao (21 years old). On the 24th of last month, she made an excuse at the school, falsely claiming that her grandmother was seriously ill, and asked for leave to go out. She lived with Jiang in the Southeast Hotel for four days. Her father found out and reported it to the French Police Station, which ordered detectives to go and arrest Jiang and Linbao, along with the introducer, Wang Genfa (formerly Wang Daifo, who sang civilized opera at a new theater), and his wife, Wang Shen. A marriage contract signed by both parties was seized, which read: "Since we met, both parties have agreed. This is a written proof because verbal agreements are unreliable. The conditions are: (1) After the marriage agreement is made, if either the man or woman is unfaithful ('unfaithful' is a mistake for 'allowed'), the man will not marry, and the woman will not marry. (2) If the man has another lover, he will compensate the woman for all losses. (3) If the agreement is terminated midway, there will be compensation for loss of reputation. Signed on September 5th, 19th year of the Republic. Signed by: Jiang Yunpeng (man), Gao Yun'e (woman), and the matchmaker, Wu Daifo." They were taken to the police station for detention and were sent to the French Court for investigation yesterday. According to Gao Linbao, she often went to Wang Genfa's house to play, so she met Jiang Yunpeng. He said that he was a comprador on a ship and was not married, so she fell in love with him out of friendship.

The Wang Genfa couple confessed that they were just introducing the couple and did not receive any compensation. At this point, Gao Liansheng, the girl's father, said that the defendants had asked people to mediate and requested a postponement. The Chinese and Western judges ordered Jiang Yunpeng to be released on bail. Wang Genfa and Wang Shen were temporarily released. Gao Linbao was taken back by her father. A one-month postponement was granted, and the two parties were ordered to attempt reconciliation.</p>

<h3>First District Police Station Solves Case</h3>
<p>Kidnappers' Cellar Discovered</p>
<p>▲Robbery and Extortion with Intent to Kidnap</p>
<p>▲Cellar Constructed Inside Westerner's Stable</p>
<p>▲Old Groom Fooled by Nephew-in-Law</p>
<p>▲Truth Obtained, Suspects Sent to Court</p>
<p>Around 7 PM the day before yesterday, four men loitered and peered around Anren Lane, Anren Street, inside the Xinbeimen (New North Gate). District Leader Dong Mingde of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, along with detectives Yuan Haishan, Yu Maolong, Ren Shouzheng, Pin Anpu, and Xu Yulin, happened to be patrolling there. They noticed the suspicious behavior of these men and immediately intercepted two of them. Upon searching them, they found a handgun on each. The other two men had already fled at the first sign of trouble. The two captured men were taken back for strict interrogation, the details of which have already been reported in this newspaper. It turns out that after strict investigation by the detectives, they discovered another cellar intended for hiding kidnap victims. The situation is quite complicated. The detailed account is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Secret Meeting in Opium Den to Plan Robbery</p>
<p>When the detectives initially apprehended the two bandits, they were immediately pre-trial questioned by District Chief Chen of the First District. One of them, identifying himself as Chen Qitang, 31 years old, from Yuyao, Shaoxing, stated that he worked as a foreman at a certain bamboo factory at No. 4 Rangde Lane, Gongxing Alley, Zhabei. Recently, at a certain opium den at No. 12 Baoyu Lane in the French Concession, he secretly conspired with his friends Cai Lefu from Chongming, as well as Wu Abing, Xiao Mibo, and others, to engage in a business venture. Subsequently, Cai provided them with two handguns. On the 2nd of this month, he, along with Wu and others, went to the residence of a Mr. Lu at No. 3 Dingxin Lane, 16th Section, Nanshi, to commit robbery. After obtaining the loot, they divided and spent it.</p>
<p>▲Purchasing Handguns with Stolen Money</p>
<p>Today (i.e., the day before yesterday), he, along with Wu and four others, went to Anren Lane, intending to rob a certain family at No. 16 of that lane. Unexpectedly, just as they were about to enter through the back door with guns, they were apprehended. He also confessed that in June of this year, they had repeatedly sent letters to Hu Ruifang, the owner of Tongtaihe Herbal Medicine Shop in Hongzhen, threatening to extort 10,000 yuan. As a result, Hu sent 300 yuan through someone to Room 12 of the Beizhan Road Inn. Half of it was spent, and the remaining half was used to purchase handguns.</p>
<p>▲Constructing Cellar Inside Stable</p>
<p>Recently, a Shandong acquaintance named Zhang mentioned that armed robbery was not as good as kidnapping. Therefore, with the help of friends like Xie Liansheng, they constructed a cellar at No. 6, near the Hongqiao Road airfield, inside the stable of a British man named Dow Ross, intending to hide kidnap victims there. He stated that it was now complete.</p>
<p>▲Bandit Den Discovered on Hongqiao Road</p>
<p>Another, identifying himself as Wu Abing, 27 years old, from Ningbo, currently residing in Laian Lane, Dongxinmin Road, Zhabei, provided a similar confession to Chen. However, he claimed to be completely unaware of the construction of the cellar for hiding kidnap victims. Based on the confessions, the detectives, along with Guo Jifen from the First District Patrol, escorted the bandit Chen to Dow Ross's stable on Hongqiao Road at around 9 AM yesterday, where they apprehended two stable hands named Wang Youfu and Liu Wanchao.</p>
<p>▲Like a Proper Secret Room</p>
<p>After Chen pointed out the location of the constructed cellar, they inspected it. The cellar was built inside the stable, with floorboards laid on top and covered with straw. A horse stood on top of it, with only a hole left for air circulation. To the untrained eye, it looked just like a stable. However, when the straw was removed, a cellar over ten feet deep was revealed. It was wide and surrounded by wooden planks, resembling a proper secret room.</p>

<p>▲Old Groom Blinded by Greed</p>
<p>After the inspection, the two captured men were taken back, and a small number of detectives were left to guard the place. Soon after, a man from Shaoxing named Zhu Jinzhi came to inquire and was immediately apprehended and brought back for questioning. Wang Youfu, 51 years old, from Yangzhou, confessed that he had been working as a stable hand for Dow Ross for over twenty years. Recently, his nephew-in-law, Xie Liansheng, came and said he wanted to borrow his stable to build a cellar for hiding kidnap victims. He refused. However, on the evening of the following day (the 1st of this month), Xie brought several carpenters and threatened him, saying that if he made a fuss, they would use their guns on him, forcing him to comply. He said he had no choice.</p>
<p>▲Gang of Criminals Sent to Court</p>
<p>When questioned, Liu Wanchao and Zhu Jinzhi claimed to know nothing about the above events. After the interrogation, due to the importance of the matter, an official document was immediately prepared, and all the suspects, along with the two handguns, were sent to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for strict investigation.</p>

<h3>Truth of Suicide</h3>
<p>Boat Dweller Places Bamboo Pole in Water</p>
<p>Wei Min Grabs the Pole and Surfaces</p>
<p>Police Head Accuses Him of Murder</p>
<p>Wei Min, from Hengshan, Hunan, came to Shanghai last month with his wife and children due to economic hardship. They stayed at Room 16, Central Apartments, Yuele Lane, Avenue Edward VII. They sustained themselves by selling their belongings. After living there for over a month without a job, and with their possessions almost completely sold off, seeing no hope for the future, he and his wife decided to commit suicide together. On the evening of the 5th of this month, they wrote a suicide note. The next evening, they left without telling anyone, with their wife and child. Around 4 AM the day before yesterday, they hired a sampan to cross the Huangpu River. After reaching the middle of the river, Wei first threw his own child into the river to drown him. Then, he and his wife jumped into the river together to commit suicide. Wei's body did not sink immediately and was rescued by the sampan operator, allowing him to survive. He was sent to the Water Police Station and then to Renji Hospital for treatment. The details were published in yesterday's newspaper. Wei's wife's body sank to the bottom of the river. After less than seven hours, it surfaced near the Dongyang Company pier in Hongkou. It was recovered by the Water Police and sent to the Bureau of Life-Saving for autopsy. The day before yesterday, around 5 PM, the hospital appointed Inspector Wang Sixian to perform the autopsy, confirming that she had drowned. He ordered the bureau to temporarily prepare a coffin and collect the body. After Wei Min was sent to the hospital by the police station, the doctor determined that he had ingested poison before jumping into the river, causing him to be unconscious. The poison was completely removed through surgery, saving his life. After a night of rest, his spirit gradually recovered. Yesterday morning at 11 AM, the Water Police Station sent a detective to bring him back to the station. Wei was wearing a Zhongshan suit and appeared well-mannered, and his speech was refined. After being interrogated by the police head, he confessed that his name was Wei Min, also known as Yan Shi or Yan Can, 38 years old, from Hengshan, Hunan. He had served as the magistrate of Guangze County, Fujian Province, for over a year, and then as the director of the Public Security Bureau of Fengrun County, Hebei Province, for about three months. His wife, Xu, was 32 years old, also from Hunan, and they had a son named Tang, 12 years old. He said that he had a little literacy and knew that both men and women should receive a proper education, so he personally taught his son to read. He said his son was very smart and had a photographic memory and had already reached the level of a senior elementary school student. At this point, he began to sob uncontrollably. He continued, saying that before coming to Shanghai this time, he had visited the capital to find old friends for work, but to no avail. After arriving in Shanghai, he discussed with his wife that she would work in a yarn factory, and he would make a living by writing, and that their son would be temporarily sent to Puyutang or an orphanage. However, none of their plans worked out. They had reached a desperate situation with no hope, so they decided to do this. Now that his family was destroyed, even though he had survived, he had no way to face his deceased wife in the afterlife. He also felt that the future was bleak and life was meaningless, and he still believed that death was more honorable than life. The police head then summoned Wu Yunqi, the manager of the Central Apartments, and Fang Xingrong, the sampan operator, who testified that Wei and his wife and child hired his sampan. After reaching the middle of the river, Wei pushed his son into the river. His wife, seeing her son in the water, also jumped in. Finally, Wei jumped in as well, but he quickly put a bamboo pole into the water (because the sampan did not have a bamboo oar), and Wei grabbed the bamboo pole and came out of the water. After verifying the testimony, Police Head He believed that Wei had committed murder and filed a public prosecution with the local court under Article 284, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law (for premeditatedly killing his son Wei Tang) and Article 290, Paragraph 1 (for instigating his wife Xu to commit suicide at the same time and place), demanding that he be investigated and dealt with according to law. That afternoon, Detective Cheng Yongnian was assigned to escort the witnesses to the court. After a preliminary hearing by Inspector Wang, he ordered them to be detained for investigation.</p>

<p>Avenue Amiral de Gex</p>
<h3>Roulette Gambling Den Raided</h3>
<p>▲Gamblers Sign and Leave</p>
<p>▲Owner Fined</p>
<p>Rong Zhusheng, a 50-year-old Cantonese man, recently set up a large private roulette gambling den in a Western-style house at No. 370 Avenue Amiral de Gex in the French Concession. He hired his fellow townsman Hu Chang as the accountant to lure people into gambling and profit from commissions. This was discovered by Deputy Western Inspector Li Deyi, Detectives Li Liansheng, Bao Tan Liu Kunbao, Xu Kaisao, Dai Rongji, and others from the French Concession Police Station. On the evening of the 6th, they disguised themselves as gamblers, rang the doorbell, and entered, arresting more than ten male and female gamblers on the spot. They confiscated a roulette gambling device, a felt table cover, and chips, as well as 437 yuan in current money, 750 yuan in banknotes, and a Hong Kong 500-yuan banknote, along with the gamblers and the owner, and took them all to the police station. The police head said that the gamblers were of a certain nationality and not under the jurisdiction of the French Concession Police Station, so he ordered them to sign and leave. Rong and Hu were released on bail and sent to the French Concession Court for investigation yesterday. The Western Inspector first reported the previous situation and presented the gambling equipment as evidence. Rong Zhusheng confessed to setting up a private gambling venue, and Hu Chang confessed that he was hired by Rong as an accountant. The Chinese and Western officials decided to fine Rong 800 yuan and Hu 200 yuan, to be confiscated as a warning, and confiscated all seized items.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's News on the Xiao Case</h3>
<p>▲Ministry of Education's Instructions</p>
<p>Regarding the incident of Ms. Xiao Xin'an from Yixing being insulted by the first mate of the Dutch Java Line, the Overseas Chinese Advancement Association believed that this matter concerned national dignity and could not be ignored. Therefore, it repeatedly carried out investigation procedures, contacted various circles, and worked hard to provide support. It also requested the Ministry of Education to actively negotiate. Yesterday, the Ministry of Education issued instructions, saying, "Telegram received. The situation has been forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review." Furthermore, the association reported to the Shanghai Women's Association at its regular meeting yesterday afternoon, and its Director-General, Madam Lin Yaoxiang, personally reported the entire story of Ms. Xiao being insulted. Unfortunately, because the number of attendees at the meeting yesterday did not meet the legal quorum, there were no results.</p>
<p>▲Java Company Thoroughly Investigates</p>
<p>The Shanghai Java Company has telegraphed its Batavia headquarters to inquire about the true facts of this matter, so as to avoid inaccurate rumors. According to sources yesterday, the Shanghai Java Company has now received a reply from its headquarters, stating that the matter is currently under investigation. However, no definitive evidence has yet been obtained, so it is not convenient to take any action. The Chinese in the Dutch East Indies also have a fair opinion on this case. However, the company is one of the Dutch merchants, and the Netherlands is known as a country ruled by law. If evidence is found in such incidents, the first mate will be dismissed and sent to the authorities for punishment, and there will be no favoritism.</p>

<p>Sun Liansheng</p>
<h3>Father's Murder Case Sentenced</h3>
<p>▲Two Death Sentences, One Life Sentence</p>
<p>In the Qujiaqiao area of Zhabei, Sun Laowu from Nantong was killed with multiple knives by his adopted son Sun Liansheng in July, in collusion with Ji Shuangquan, Qiu Shuntao, Qiu Lansheng, and others. The Public Security Bureau sent all the criminals to the local court. The prosecutor investigated and prosecuted. The criminal court director Shen Bingrong, with patience and care, carefully interrogated the suspects. Sun Liansheng confessed that he was instigated by Ji Shuangquan in advance, and Ji Shuangquan arranged for Qiu Shuntao, Qiu Lansheng, and others to conspire for many days to kill the deceased together. Ji moved first. Although Li and Qiu denied it, the evidence presented each time was not in their favor. Therefore, the results of the case review showed that the premeditated murder had been proven. Yesterday morning, court director Shen and prosecutor Zhao announced the sentences: Sun Liansheng and Ji Shuangquan were sentenced to death, Qiu Shuntao was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Qiu Lansheng was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment. After the sentencing, they were remanded to custody pending further instructions.</p>

They arrived at the North Station at 7:30 PM. Today is the second day of the tide watch, and the number of people who pre-purchased tide-watching tickets has more than doubled compared to the first day, so the railway bureau has prepared more vehicles for use.</p>

<h3>Reflections and Efforts for This Year's National Day</h3>
<p>(A) Necessary Understandings (1) National Perspective: From the National Revolution to National Construction, the most important condition lies in the enrichment and vigorous development of the people's strength. Based on the experiences of the past nineteen years, it is deeply understood that the development of the National Revolution and the expansion of the people's strength are directly proportional. On this year's National Day, as we look around the domestic situation, we can further prove that the Chinese Revolution has entered a new stage. The remaining counter-revolutionary forces of warlords, political hoodlums, and party hacks can no longer withstand the firm will of the people nationwide to support the central government, maintain unity, and vigorously implement construction. Therefore, at the beginning of any rebellion or disturbance, their momentum is always great, but before long, they all collapse and are annihilated. All compatriots should have a deep understanding of this great power. As for the National Government, it is progressing from formal unity to political, diplomatic, and military unity. Local autonomy is advancing from careful planning to gradual implementation. Overthrowing imperialism has progressed from passive resistance to active self-strengthening. All of this requires the power of the people as a guarantee for final victory. (2) Party Perspective: Secondly, within the Party, we also feel that the foundation is no longer as shaky as before. Needless to say, the murderous and arsonist Communist Party has long been cleared out. Even the reorganizationists who colluded with the Communist Party to conspire to undermine the Party have all</p>
<p>been removed. On the other hand, the Party has begun to absorb revolutionary elements and solicit prospective Party members after clearing out corrupt and degenerated elements. The Party's progress, on the one hand, has shifted from past parades and slogan shouting to engaging in the practical work of the Seven Grassroots Movements. On the other hand, it has shifted from scattered and spontaneous propaganda to unified propaganda training. The Party's doctrines have also gradually transitioned from principled political programs and policies to laws that are practical norms for national life. The relationship between the Party and politics is also gradually moving from being unrelated to gradually reflecting the Party's will in the implementation of politics. In short, everything clearly indicates that the Party has moved from consolidation to development, from superficiality to practicality, from ardent revolutionary emotions to unified revolutionary action. The Party's internal consolidation has been largely completed, and the Party's practical application is gradually restoring the functions it had before the purge.</p>
<p>(B) Future Efforts: The current situation of the nation and the Party has entered a new stage, as mentioned above. However, the crises facing the nation and the Party are still numerous and imminent, allowing no room for optimism. Moreover, this is only entering a new stage; it does not mean that the revolution has already succeeded. It is like entering the gate, but whether one can enter the hall and the room depends entirely on one's own efforts. Now, I will try to elaborate on the main and important tasks for the future as follows: (I) Main Tasks: (A) Vigorously Implement Local Autonomy and Work Hard on the Seven Grassroots Movements. The reason for the failure of the Xinhai Revolution lies in the lack of a foundation for local autonomy. This is what the Premier once said with great sorrow. The Premier said that without local autonomy as the foundation for construction, the drawbacks would be (1) the inability to break down official rule, (2) the people's lack of understanding of the politics of the central government and the provinces, and (3) elections becoming a shortcut for unscrupulous gentry and local bullies to seek official positions. The people would lose the basis for participating in national affairs, and national affairs would be manipulated by military men and bureaucrats. The work of the Seven Grassroots Movements is the basic work of local autonomy. Investigating household registration and surveying land are the basic facilities of local autonomy. Various local autonomy regulations are the norms for the implementation of local autonomy. The organization of various local mass organizations is the basic organization of local autonomy. Therefore, in the future, we should engage in the Seven Grassroots Movements if there is a movement, and help the government investigate household registration and survey land if there is assistance. If there is organization, we should organize various local mass organizations. The basis of our activities is the various regulations of local autonomy. In this way, not only will bandits and communists be forever eradicated from the countryside, completing the revolutionary mission, but also a solid foundation will be laid. This is the first major thing we should strive for in the future. (B) Vigorously Implement Revolutionary Diplomacy and Abolish All Unequal Treaties. The Premier said, "Unequal treaties are the bill of sale of the Chinese people." If we cannot achieve the goal of abolishing unequal treaties, then all the aspirations of the Chinese nation will be hopeless. However, the imperialists who imposed unequal treaties on China rely solely on unequal treaties to exploit China for their survival. They will never listen to China's aspirations and dig their own graves. Therefore, the abolition of unequal treaties cannot rely on ordinary diplomacy, especially not on the diplomacy of the Beijing government. It must rely on revolutionary diplomacy. The so-called revolutionary diplomacy is to guide the conduct of diplomacy with the will of the entire nation, to engage in the actual construction of the entire nation, so that the imperialists lose the basis of unequal treaties, and to have a spirit of perseverance, peace, and self-defense so that the imperialists are forced to finally yield. This kind of diplomacy is revolutionary diplomacy. This is the second major thing we should strive for in the future. (C) Implement a Conscription System and Strive for the Economic Construction of the People's Livelihood. The success of the Xinhai Revolution was due to the feudal warlords breaking away from the control of their central government and combining with the revolutionary forces. The failure of the Xinhai Revolution was also due to the fact that the armed forces that overthrew the Qing Dynasty were borrowed from others, and the final act was a compromise with the warlords. Therefore, the revolutionary forces ultimately failed to create a new organization-centered popular armed force to replace the old organization-centered warlord armed force. However, to create a genuine popular armed force, it is necessary to abolish the mercenary system, which is the source of the current warlord armed forces, and replace it with a national military system of conscription. However, to abolish the current mercenary system, it is necessary to eliminate the social conditions that accompany this military organization. In other words, if we want to actively reduce the army now, we must quickly find ways to resettle those who have been laid off so that they do not become unemployed again, and those who have already lost their jobs do not become soldiers or bandits. This cannot be done by shouting slogans and parading. It is necessary to develop China's production and strive for economic construction. However, this kind of economic construction must be the economic construction of the People's Livelihood in order to avoid repeating the mistakes of capitalism and leaving endless troubles for the future. Therefore, implementing a conscription system and striving for the economic construction of the People's Livelihood is the third major thing we should strive for in the future. All of these must be earnestly strived for in accordance with the Three Principles of the People in order to promote their realization in the shortest possible time. We cannot have the slightest hesitation, nor can we have the slightest slackness. Arise, comrades, compatriots, and work hard! (II) Current Tasks: The main tasks to be strived for in the future are as described above. Now, I will list the tasks that should be strived for at present in a simple way. (1) Help the Central Army Thoroughly Eliminate the Rebels. This rebel group was formed by the treacherous Yan Xishan, Feng Yuxiang, Wang Jingwei, and others, who gathered all the new and old corrupt and evil forces in an attempt to succeed. The central government is striving to eliminate evil completely and once and for all, and is confident of final victory. However, in order to shorten the period of this campaign against the rebels, it is necessary for compatriots throughout the country to unanimously denounce and provide substantial assistance. (2) Expedite the Clearing of the Countryside and Annihilate the Bandits and Communists. In recent years, while the Central Army has been preoccupied with military campaigns against the rebels, the Communist bandits have taken advantage of the situation to grow in secret and gather to cause trouble. Compatriots in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi have suffered even more from their ravages. The central government has ordered He Yingqin, Director of the Wuhan Headquarters, to be in charge of suppressing the Communists. It is hoped that compatriots throughout the country will work together to thoroughly clear the countryside, eradicate the roots of the Communist bandits, and ensure the peace of the region. (3) Consolidate the Central Government and Eliminate All Reactionary Forces. If the revolution is to have strength, it must be concentrated. The central government is the headquarters for concentrating revolutionary forces. If there is anything unsatisfactory about the central government, everyone has the obligation to offer opinions for the central government to adopt, to contribute their abilities, and to take on a portion of the work. Therefore, revolutionary elements must consolidate the central government and concentrate under the guidance of the central government, fighting for the Party and the nation. Only counter-revolutionary elements fear the consolidation of the central government, even spreading rumors and slanders in the hope of undermining it and preventing the completion of the revolutionary cause. Therefore, we should consolidate the central government, eliminate all reactionary forces, and promote the rapid advancement of revolutionary construction.</p>

<h3>Forging Seals and Signing Bad Checks</h3>
<p>▲ Two Store Employees Detained for Investigation</p>
<p>Hong Binghua, a salesman at the Denghua Xing Hardware Store at 155-6 Edward Road, recently forged the seal of the Peichang Xiang Hardware Store on Gonghe Road in Zhabei and signed a bad check to fraudulently obtain goods worth $345.364 from his store for pawning. On the 6th of this month, the Mid-Autumn Festival according to the lunar calendar, Denghua Xing ordered his employee to collect the payment for the goods from Peichang Xiang. The store informed him that they had not received the goods, so how could they collect payment? Denghua Xing compared the seal on the bad check with the seal of Peichang Xiang and discovered that they did not match. He then realized that he had been defrauded and reported it to the General Police Station. Detective Ma Wenda investigated and learned that Hong had done it. He was arrested and three forged seals of Peichang Xiang and a printing cylinder were found. He was taken to the police station. Under interrogation, Hong confessed that Xie Ruiting was also involved in the matter. Detective Ma immediately arrested Xie. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court. The police lawyer, Dang Bao Yi, requested an extension because further investigation of the evidence was needed. Judge Xu Jia briefly questioned the two defendants and ordered a retrial in seven days.</p>
<h3>Fire in Dongjiadu Yesterday</h3>

The fire spread rapidly. Before rescue could be carried out, four thatched houses were burned down, and one thatched house and two reed mat sheds belonging to the neighboring Ni Xiuzhang were also demolished to prevent the fire from spreading. Later, the Huachang ramie factory and the Lida factory each drove motor belt cars to the scene to extinguish the fire. When the fire was raging, Inspector Liu of the Third Precinct of the Public Security Bureau led the police to the scene to maintain order. Afterwards, he ordered the police to investigate the cause of the fire and await verification.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: In the "Local News" column of your newspaper on the 7th of this month, there was a report on the ban on exporting glutinous rice in packages. The fact is not true. It has been verified that the rice was purchased by Liu Huiqing, the lieutenant colonel adjutant of the Provisional Cavalry First Division of the National Revolutionary Army, headed by Wang Guide, the division commander, with a passport issued by the National Government on September 6th, who came to Shanghai to purchase 2,500 packages of military rice last month. Our company undertook the task. However, because it was a time when new and old rice were not connected, we were deeply afraid of hindering the people's food supply, so we delayed it until the new glutinous rice was on the market before we started transporting it a few days ago. Moreover, the passport has been verified and stamped by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Customs Supervision Department of the Ministry of Finance in Shanghai, and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, indicating the date. This is based on solid evidence and is not fraudulent. Adjutant Liu, the purchaser, has already telegraphed the above situation to his superiors and forwarded it to the National Government for instructions to comply with the release. Our company is even more afraid that the rumors are not true, so we specially send a letter to request a correction. Please check it out. Respectfully, Qingsheng Yixing, Yonghexiang, October 8th.</p>

<h3>Thanking All Those Who Have Supported the National Products Movement</h3>
<p>Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>▲How to Resolve the Difficulties Facing the Future of National Products: The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has been approved by the Municipal Government to hold the third National Products Movement Conference in this city for a week around the Double Ten Festival this year. We are very grateful and honored for the support of various agencies, organizations, and celebrities from all walks of life. We will edit a special issue for publicity. We are also grateful to Minister Zhang and Mayor Chong Xi for writing inscriptions, and to party comrades, scholars, and celebrities for contributing articles to enhance the content, which should especially thank the national products business community. However, we want to thank the many gentlemen, ladies, and misses who have supported the national products movement. We cannot just say a few polite words and be done with it. We should understand the enthusiasm of everyone for promoting national products and the great desire for the development of the national products industry. Let's raise a practical issue and discuss it with everyone in earnest, or perhaps we can work together to solve this problem at this conference. Then everyone's enthusiasm will not be disappointed. The serious and urgent problem is how to resolve the difficulties facing the future of national products. Before raising this issue, I had roughly read many articles in the special issue of the National Products Movement Conference. Upon analysis, the intentions of the gentlemen are certainly different. For example, Mr. Tao Baichuan, Mr. Xu Yushu (Yongzuo), and Mr. Chen Tingzhen advocated the general production of national products. Mr. Fan Zhongyun advocated the production of national products for daily use. Mr. Zhu Yinong, Mr. Feng Ziming, and Mr. Tao Xisheng specially focused on the agricultural products of this country. Mr. Pan Yangyao (Wen'an) specially focused on scientific management and financial cooperation. Mr. Yan Duhe and Mr. Chen Lingseng called on the women's community to make efforts, and Mr. Li Haoran and Mr. Zhou Shoujuan hoped that the Chinese people would rise up together and fulfill their responsibilities. Mr. Zha Zhongjian (Renwei) hoped that the national products movement would not start in a missionary style and end in a missionary style, etc. However, in summary, they all deeply feel that the development of national products cannot be achieved solely by the unity of consumers, especially not by the formal meetings held once a year. In other words, they all sincerely shouted out, "Strive to develop the production of national products, but the production of national products..." Why should it be developed? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Housewife (calling a doctor's house) Excuse me. Please have the doctor come quickly. We are the Chen family on Changbang Road. My child has swallowed a sewing needle.</p>
<p>Doctor's attendant: The doctor is very busy with patients right now. He can't leave. If you urgently need a sewing needle, then just go buy another one. It costs only one copper coin. Very cheap.</p>
<p>Aunt (cutting two pieces of cake, one large and one small, and placing them on the table, speaking to her two young nephews): Now I want to test your character. Let's see which one of you is polite and takes the smaller piece to eat.</p>
<p>One Nephew (snatching the larger piece and putting it in his mouth): Aunt, my brother's character has always been good. No need to test it.</p>
<p>Girl A: Miss C is very free. No one interferes with her actions. She is free to marry a man she likes.</p>
<p>Girl B: Then why hasn't she gotten married yet?</p>
<p>Girl A: Because the men she likes mostly don't like her.</p>
<p>Girl A: Why do you always adhere to bachelorhood? Don't you want to get married? You should know that the flavor of married life is the best. It's truly sweeter than honey.</p>
<p>Girl B: Hold on. How long have you been married?</p>
<p>Girl A: Just one month.</p>
<p>Girl B: I see.</p>
<h3>Remembering the Scenery of Jinghua While Appreciating the Moon During the Mid-Autumn Festival</h3>
<p>— Zizai Elder</p>
<p>The annual Mid-Autumn Festival has hastily passed. There is a saying in Guangzhou, "Long Jiguang invites you to appreciate the moon," which refers to someone dying an unnatural death, namely, the commemoration of the former Guangzhou Police Chief Chen Jinghua's murder. Chen was a native of Xiangshan. During the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, he served as the magistrate of Rong County in Guangxi, known for his ability, integrity, and incorruptibility, which pleased the people. When Cen Chunxuan was the Governor-General of Liangguang, he attempted to appease the notorious bandit Lu A'fa. Chen knew that Lu's thieving nature was unchangeable, so he secretly ordered his subordinates to kill him. Cen removed Chen from his post and ordered his arrest, so Chen fled to Southeast Asia, joined a newspaper, and became a leading writer, engaging in revolutionary activities.</p>
<p>In the spring of the first year of the Republic, Chen took charge of the police administration in Guangdong Province, wielding formidable power that inspired awe. In Guangzhou, there was a group known as the "One Hundred and Two Friends," wearing white shoes and green socks, swaggering through the streets, robbing, intimidating, and committing all sorts of evil. Chen captured and killed them one by one, always giving the condemned a cigarette with a "bandit" brand before execution. As a result, the Cantonese people considered smoking "bandit brand" cigarettes unlucky and refused to eat them. Thus, the bandit brand cigarettes were ignored, another method of resisting foreign goods.</p>
<p>Chen personally handled everything, not relying on others to draft official documents. His writing was simple, mostly ten or fewer words, or just two or three sentences. He abandoned all clichés such as "for announcement and strict compliance." Once, a teacher reported a theft. Chen picked up his pen and wrote, "Stealing the teacher's alfalfa dish, these stingy thieves are truly pathetic and also hateful. Case filed, arrest the bandits for investigation," and so on. Another time, in a public announcement, he began by saying, "Jinghua is known for killing people, everyone knows this, no need to elaborate." His official documents were unusually peculiar, which can be seen in these examples.</p>
<p>When the police escorted prisoners, Chen's eyes would gleam brightly. If he recognized them, he would always say, "Shoot them!" (a Cantonese idiom for execution). The police officers would then carry out the execution. The prisoners had no chance to defend themselves. If they loudly cursed, he would only impose a fine or detain them for a few months. It is said that during Chen's year and a half in charge of the police, he killed over a thousand people, but none were wrongly executed. His discerning judgment was such.</p>
<p>Whenever Chen went out, he forbade attendants and servants, traveling wherever he pleased, regardless of weather or time of day. He would either examine the police officers' knowledge or inspect the work of the district offices, clearly distinguishing rewards and punishments, and using only talented individuals. Old gentry, wealthy merchants, superiors, military officers, relatives, and friends were strictly rejected if they tried to intercede or make requests. He made administrative decisions with utmost fairness. Therefore, the police administration at that time was clean and honest from top to bottom, but the corrupt gentry and litigious individuals hated him to the bone.</p>
<p>When Pan Dawei produced and performed the new drama "Sounds of Tears" and asked Chen to write an inscription, Chen wrote "Heaven and Earth Are Unkind" for him, signed as "Chen Jinghua, Sinner of the World," meaning that heaven and earth are unkind, treating all things as straw dogs, and his own power is too weak to universally save all living beings, truly a sinner of the world. One can imagine his inner thoughts.</p>
<p>Blind girls, maids, nuns, and prostitutes within the city who were abused would seek refuge at the police station, or if discovered, Chen would send them to the Women's Education Institute, which he had personally established. It housed over eight hundred helpless women, providing both education and skills training. This was Chen's greatest achievement in Guangdong and indirectly caused his death. Keeping maids and taking concubines were common among the wealthy. Liberating women was humane, but those who did not understand the principles only felt hatred. When the institute was first being organized, the director, Mr. Xu, met with Chen at the police station. Chen drafted the announcement in just ten minutes. At that time, he spoke as he wrote, his face radiant, saying that he had no regrets even if he died after this one deed. Little did he know that death was urging him on, following closely behind.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the second year of the Republic, the Second Revolution failed, and party members fled overseas. Chen, confident in his integrity and impartiality, shouldered the responsibility of maintaining local public security and could not bear to leave. At that time, Long Jiguang flattered Yuan Shikai to secure his position and, incited by corrupt gentry and merchants, telegraphed Yuan, saying that Chen was showing signs of disloyalty. Long invited Chen to the government office on the evening of Mid-Autumn Festival to appreciate the moon. Chen went without hesitation and was brutally murdered. The next day, it was announced, and the whole city was shocked. His body was displayed in the market, and coffin shops jointly refused to sell coffins. His family had to buy a foreign coffin in Shameen to finally carry out the burial, which was in the Hong Kong Coffee Garden. Initially, Chen, seeing that party members often used coffins to transport weapons, causing many abuses, ordered coffin shops to report the names and addresses of coffin buyers on a weekly basis for verification. However, the merchants considered this a harsh policy and went on strike. Chen immediately ordered them to resume business within twenty-four hours or face closure. Since they could not sell to other places, the merchants complied. When Chen died, the coffin shops, hearing the news, jointly refused to sell coffins as revenge.</p>
<p>Chen had two concubines living in Hong Kong. His favorite was Mo Chou, Chen himself went by the alias Wuyang. Little did he know that Wuyang would indeed have an ailment, and Mo Chou would turn into constant sorrow. Such are the unpredictable things in life. In previous years, Chen's colleagues in the Guangzhou police force, remembering his achievements, collected funds to cast a statue of him to commemorate him. Even now, when people in Guangzhou discuss police administration, they all remember Chen's accomplishments. Alas, the Mid-Autumn moon is cold, looking south at the Pearl River, the man is gone, and his policies have ceased. I cannot help but sigh with emotion.</p>
<h3>A Lesson from Protecting the Communists</h3>
<p>— A Refugee from Hunan Province</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed the National Government requesting amnesty for political prisoners, including the Communist bandits who committed murder and arson. If someone vouches that they will no longer be bandits, they can be pardoned after three years. His benevolent words and broad benefits are deeply admirable. However, those who vouch for the Communist bandits must be prepared to be brutally killed by the bandits themselves. The Communist rebellion in Hunan Province on July 27 of this year has a tragic history that serves as a warning to those who protect Communist bandits in the future. I urgently record it for future reference.</p>
<p>Yuan Zhenhuang, a native of Changsha, once served as the acting director of the Hunan Provincial Communist Reformatory. He was known for his strong sense of friendship. He had an old acquaintance with Wu Shangzhi. Wu's only son, Wu Yizhuang, was an important figure in the Communist Party. He was arrested after a case and Wu Shangzhi asked Yuan to rescue him. Yuan tried various methods to save him from death. After being reformed in the reformatory, he was released. During the Communist occupation of Changsha, Wu Yizhuang still held an important position in the Communist Party. Yuan was trapped in the city and felt extremely threatened. He thought that since he had saved Wu Yizhuang before, and Wu Yizhuang was still an important figure in the Communist Party, he could seek refuge with Wu. Although his friends tried to stop him, they could not persuade him. Wu lived outside the Liuyang Gate. Yuan risked his life to go to Wu's house. Wu Yizhuang was not at home. His father, Wu Shangzhi, warmly received him and agreed to protect him. Soon, Wu Yizhuang returned home. His father introduced Yuan to him, saying, "This is the benefactor who saved you. You should help him." Wu Yizhuang replied, "I don't care about these things," and then went out. Seeing that the situation was not good, Yuan intended to leave. However, Wu's father insisted on keeping him, saying, "No matter what, I will protect you." So Yuan stayed. After two hours, Wu Yizhuang brought a group of Communist bandits to arrest Yuan. Yuan immediately knelt down and begged, saying that his elderly mother was over eighty years old and begged to be spared so that he could take care of his mother in her remaining years, and that he would donate all his family property. Wu Yizhuang said, "You are Uncle Yuan, my father's friend. I know that. But we Communists do not recognize parents, let alone parents' friends. If I let you go, my comrades will not agree." After speaking, he ordered the bandits to drag him out. The bandits immediately put a rope around Yuan's neck and dragged him face down. They dragged him to the Liuyang Gate, and the flesh on Yuan's face had been completely torn off. The bandits then stabbed him repeatedly and left him there. Although Yuan was seriously injured, he was not dead. When the Communists occupied Changsha, no one buried him. After several days, when the National Army entered the city and were collecting the corpses, they saw that Yuan was still alive. They sent him to the hospital for treatment. His family also gathered to see him. He personally recounted the beginning and end of the persecution as above. He died one day later. The people of Changsha did not pity him at first, because he had protected the Communist bandits and it was his own fault.</p>
<h3>A Record of Watching a Play at the Grand Theatre</h3>
<p>— Chen Yanheng</p>
<p>I have not been to the theater for a long time. It happened that Liu Jun Huogong invited me to the Grand Theatre to watch Cheng Yushuang perform "Visiting Mother and Returning the Order" in the evening. I had wanted to meet Yushuang since she came south, and with Huogong's invitation, I arrived at the Grand Theatre at half past nine in the evening. I first went backstage to meet Yushuang. I also saw Zhao Tongshan, Jiang Miaoxiang, Wu Fuqin, Wang Shaolou, Nai Weng Yulou, and Hangzhou, Zigang, Chen Hongshou, Hu Tiefen and other gentlemen. I was very happy to see old friends after a long separation. By the time "Visiting Mother" took the stage, it was already ten o'clock. Yushuang's performance was dignified and fluent, and her skills were becoming more and more profound. There is no need to elaborate. Her recitation and singing have also changed a lot compared to before. It is said that Yushuang has recently been studying phonetics, carefully deliberating on the four tones of Yin and Yang, and sparing no effort to correct the faults of the masses and explore the true meaning. This is the foundation of opera, which is not known by ordinary people. I once considered it a pity that the Qingyi performers boasted of new tunes but did not pay attention to the sounds of the words. Yushuang has been famous for a long time, but she dares not to be complacent and strives to study the fundamentals, exhausting her energy. A person like Yushuang can truly be called an ambitious person, rare and commendable. Yushuang has invited me to see her when she has time for a detailed study. What I know may not be helpful to Yushuang, but with Yushuang's love of learning and deep thinking, she may gain more insights, so her progress in art will have no end. I returned after the performance ended after midnight. I wrote this down because of this joyful event. It was the day before the Mid-Autumn Festival of the Gengwu year.</p>
<p>According to Teacher Yan, he has been suffering from a stomach illness for many years and rarely goes to the theater. This time, Yushuang took the stage, and he made an exception to watch and write an article to praise her. He usually does not like to write play reviews, so his expectations for Yushuang are profound. Written by Xu Jifu of Haichang in the Siqian Chamber of the Sea.</p>
<h3>Travelogue of Southeast Asia (62)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>25th: Received a telegram from the Chinese Association in Wa City, inviting me to give a lecture in Wa. On this day, I lectured on the "Three Changes in the Status of Women" at the Chinese Girls' School, roughly stating that the matrilineal era was the golden age. The second was the slave era. Now is the era of pseudo-equality attached to male competition. Both eras have seen male warlords killing humans the most. The principal, Zhou Huixian, a native of Jiangsu, founded the school on her own and is very capable. Received a letter from Zhang Mingci, informing me that he and his wife had arrived in Singapore.</p>
<p>27th: Wang Fangyuan rented a car and invited Daode Master and Wanhui Master to travel together and take photos. In the evening, I went to the Yunxin Poetry Society to review poetry scrolls. There were a total of seventy couplets. A couplet by a certain gentleman was considered the best. The line said: "New poetry reports that you have found a fairy companion, major policies consult with wild people." I commented: "The blessings of gods and immortals, the measure of sages and worthies. Place it first."</p>
<p>28th: Because I received three telegrams of welcome from the Chinese Association in Wa City, I took the train north. Mr. Wang Fangyuan came to see me off. Handling luggage and buying tickets was very troublesome. Without him, it would not have been possible. Wang said that tickets can be bought in advance to avoid the crowds at the station. I remember that the ticket sales method in Suzhou is very good. You can buy and sell at various branch sales points. Also, one station has multiple windows for sales. Before I boarded the train, I had a lot of food with me. After I boarded, I regretted that it was not necessary, because there were too many food vendors along the way. All kinds of water, pastries, and food were available. As soon as the train stopped, Jilin people, Zhongzhou people, Karar people, or ghosts would pull a small cart to the window and shout to sell. There were also those selling long-necked clay pots. I was initially suspicious of this. Later, I realized that it was hot and everyone needed to drink, so this was used to hold water. The third-class fare to Wa City was six shields. Luggage can be placed in the car. The situation in the car is similar to that in Beijing and Shanghai. The first to arrive can occupy a place to lie down. Those who arrive later stand for a long time and no one cares. The Chinese fairness is on the Taiyuan to Shijiazhuang line. Foreigners check the car, and passengers cannot invade other people's seats. Luggage has a fixed location, which is very suitable. The Burmese men and women smoking in the car are annoying. Burmese women smoking is common. Along the way, I saw many rice fields, water, and yellow cattle. Water buffalo have their noses floating, there is a poem to prove it.</p>
<p>From Yangon to Mandalay for a thousand miles (the old capital is Mandalay)</p>
<p>Minarets and sparse forests reflect the sun brightly.</p>
<p>People in the rice fields, buffalo float their noses,</p>
<p>Children hold fishing rods across short bridges.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (290)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Tears Stain the Bamboo, the Beauty's Heart is Broken, the Fragrance of the Red Lotus Fades, and the Soul of the Maiden Departs</p>
<p>Zuo Shichen said, "Why didn't I ever see you when I came to your place?" Cuiyun said, "They had already been transferred out when you came. Maybe you saw her on stage, but did you pay attention? When we perform, no matter how heartbroken we are, we must pretend to smile and entertain the guests when we are on stage. Even if our parents die, we can only wipe away our tears and go out to perform. That's why eating this deadly courtesan's rice bowl is devoid of any humanity. Isn't that what people call playing with courtesans, buying smiles? The young masters paid money to find pleasure. If you are frowning at them, how can they be happy?" Zuo Shichen said, "Hong Lianxiang came from a scholarly family, how could she fall into a brothel?" Cuiyun sighed and said, "That's something I can't tell you. When a person falls, many of the young ladies who are officials or live in mansions eat courtesan's rice, open private doors, and go to the salt pork shops. In the beginning, it's always their own lack of discipline, or they are seduced by others. There is no way for the family to lock them up. It's not good to listen to them naturally. The parents who are strict and upright drive them away and never allow them to come to the door, only counting this daughter as having died. But it becomes impossible for them to return home and see their parents. It can be said that 'one wrong step leads to eternal regret.' At that time, they harden their hearts. Since their chastity has been broken anyway, it's bad to have one lover, and it's bad to have a dozen lovers. Their reputation is ruined anyway. Might as well go all the way. Where can't they go? At first, it's not for money. Later, since their parents refuse to take them in, they also need to eat, dress up, and live in a house. Of course, they also want their lives, so they can't help but do it for money. However, like Hong Lianxiang, she didn't fall on her own. It was really to save her family. If she didn't step into the brothel, the whole family would have starved to death. She still owed people money when her father died. She often told me that as long as her mother could live and her brothers had money to study, it wouldn't matter if she sacrificed a little. She never squandered a penny. She really was the most clear-headed and reliable person among our little sisters. I think she will never be down on her luck in the future. She is a person with principles. Her face is also good. Her personality is also gentle. And she's doing business on her own. It's not wasteful. But after all, it's much more free to be in someone else's house than to be someone who pleases others." Who knew that she would marry someone and die such a wrongful death. It really is like what the ancients said, "Beautiful women have short lives." Zuo Shichen said, "Did she marry in Shanghai? In Shanghai, if you marry someone and you're not happy, you just walk away. Why did she have to give up her life? Didn't you come out because you weren't happy?"</p>

<h3>The Promising Outlook for Silver Liquidity</h3>
<p>Market Overview: For several days, the silver and money industry has been unable to provide detailed records due to repeated customs closures followed by cumbersome procedures after reopening. Consequently, there has been no information regarding the market's condition.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Public Bonds Suddenly Weakened Yesterday</p>
<p>Consolidation and troop reduction bonds down more than one yuan, Customs duties fell 8 jiao.</p>

Futures trading remained active, with transactions reaching over 7 million yuan in the morning and over 4.5 million yuan in the afternoon. Except for the continued 25 issue and continued bonds, the rest have been issued. Regarding the changes in bond prices, the market opened strong in the morning, and trading was quite active. However, buying continued to dominate, and the trend became firmer. Later, buying became calmer, while selling remained active, and bond prices uniformly fell, turning weak across the board. As a result, compared to the previous day, futures for consolidation and troop reduction bonds fell by one yuan each, while customs duties futures and the current June issue fell by 8 jiao. Other fluctuations were minimal.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yarn Market Trends Downward</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending weak due to the global economic downturn. American cotton and third-grade yarn are uniformly trending downstream, causing pessimism. The sales of current yarn in the market are not very smooth. Banditry is rampant in various inland areas, resulting in thin sales volume. However, some factories remain bullish. The Chaozhou gang is calm and unwavering, with both bullish and bearish sides strongly holding their positions. Overall, the upward momentum is weaker, and the market is currently in a state of consolidation.</p>
<p>Human Bidding Buyers are Scarce: At the opening of the market for human bidding, the market atmosphere was still flat. Later, due to a lack of buyers, new low prices were discovered for American cotton, and third-grade yarn fell, causing the market atmosphere to suddenly loosen. Prices for all months fell by 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 qian. The afternoon market continued to decline, with prices for all months falling by another 2, 3, and 4 qian. The total transactions for the day amounted to 12,400 bales. It was found that 950 bales were sold by Gongzou, 1,300 bales by Rongxing, 950 bales by Dachangcheng, 600 bales by Gengling, and 600 bales by Yichang, with the rest selling 200 to 300 bales. 900 bales were bought by Tianchang, 500 bales by Da, 550 bales by Tianjiang, 750 bales by Yiyu, and 600 bales by Lichang, with the rest buying 300 to 400 bales. The closing prices for human bidding are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Human Bidding Price	Month	Increase/Decrease	Inventory</p>
<p>132	October	-13	1,750</p>
<p>1523	January	-9	55,500</p>
<p>1524	November	9	39,850</p>
<p>1525	January	-7	24,600</p>
<p>1522	December	-10	57,800</p>
<p>1527	March	-12	20,300</p>
<p>Current Demand Remains Strong: Sales of current yarn remain good. It was found that the total amount of current and futures bought by various gangs throughout the day was 1,915 bales. The market price of Japanese yarn fell slightly. Customer gangs imported 425 bales from Sichuan, 435 bales from Qingdao, 95 bales from inland areas, 650 bales from Hankou, 150 bales from Tianjin, and 160 bales from miscellaneous sources.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Decline Gradually Apparent</h3>
<p>The cotton market is weak, and a downward trend is gradually emerging. Judging from foreign cotton, there is a risk of a significant drop because American cotton broke through the 1-jiao mark, causing some people in this port to become skeptical. However, most inland merchants have not yet released their bullish positions. The Tongzhou gang views the local harvest as poor, so the amount they absorb is huge, and they are holding on tightly. However, Chinese and foreign manufacturers have already purchased enough American and Indian cotton, and the position of Chinese cotton has long been snatched away. Therefore, factories have no news of purchases. If future supplies crowd into Shanghai, there will be a drastic decline. Therefore, in recent days, the Dongyang gang has been selling vigorously. The Yong'an manufacturers had previously agreed to purchase the November and December futures at 2 liang, but now they view the situation as unfavorable and have canceled the agreement. In the afternoon, prices for all months broke through the 2-liang mark.</p>
<p>Weakness of the Han Bidding Situation: The Han bidding market opened weak because the new low price for American cotton in October caused scattered bullish traders to waver.

<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Hexia Rice Market Already Declining</p>
<p>Yesterday, about thirty ships from the Wu gang arrived at Zhabei. Sales in the market were sluggish. New glutinous rice originally had special sales before the festival, so it frequently increased by as much as 2 yuan. However, this time, the japonica rice was detained by customs due to being shipped to Qingdao and transshipped to the East Ocean. Therefore, all bag transactions were suspended yesterday, and the market situation was weak. In the spring and summer of this year, due to the poor harvest last autumn, more than 8 million shi of foreign rice were ordered and arrived in Shanghai for relief. However, this time, seeing the new rice, the harvests in various places were excellent, and the supply to Shanghai was thriving. The rice price fell from 21 yuan to around 16 yuan, but then cunning merchants actually agitated for exports, causing the rice price to rise again. Yesterday morning, japonica sales turned sluggish, and the price fell by 3 jiao. High-quality goods opened at 17.78 yuan, with few transactions. The Yaozhong rice market was very flat, and the newly arrived price still opened at 17.34 yuan. Yangxian and Duzixian rice followed the japonica situation and went downstream. Top-quality goods were priced at 13.67 yuan, about 2 or 3 jiao lower. Both the port rice and the customer rice were slightly weak, and the overall trend showed signs of decline. The Bianyuan hanging price was flat, and the price was also slightly sluggish. Yinhua still opened at 15.67 yuan, and the market situation was mediocre.</p>
<p>Yesterday in South Shanghai, river arrivals continued, totaling about thirty to forty ships. Sales in the main street were still acceptable. New japonica rice prices trended flat and weak, but the transactions between buyers and sellers were excellent. Ordinary Su and Tong gang japonica rice opened at around 16 yuan. Qingding and Sijing rice opened at 16.45 yuan, with few arrivals and acceptable demand. The Yangdu tip rice turned to consolidation, with the general plate opening at 12 yuan. Port tip rice sales were extremely active, with Yixing and Liyang goods opening at 11.45 yuan. Hundred yuan highs opened at 17 yuan without any increase or decrease.</p>
<h3>Standard Flour Backing Off, Not Advancing</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning and afternoon, the market for each month presented a tired and stagnant appearance. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat fell by another 7-8 jiao to 1 yuan, the mood of most people remained soft. However, because the goals of the major manufacturers were different, the amount of stopped sales was not large. Only the general inland manufacturers and small-to-medium manufacturers in this port, because foreign wheat had been ordered, had always been bearish and did not want it to rise. Therefore, the morning was initially calm, but then due to the continued selling by small factories, each month invisibly turned tired. If foreign wheat falls further, it will surely soften further. As a result, this month fell by 7.5 li compared to the previous day, November fell by 7.5 li, December fell by 1 fen 3.5 li, January fell by 1.5 fen, and February and March fell by 1.75 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Trending Higher from Lows</h3>
<p>After the opening of the futures wheat market yesterday morning and afternoon, the market for each month presented an initial appearance of fatigue followed by firmness. The market opened weak in the morning because the quoted price of foreign wheat continued to fall by 7-8 jiao to 1 yuan. However, the buying interest of bullish individuals (or a certain major factory) in near and distant periods suddenly became strong, and the quantity purchased continuously was huge. Therefore, the fatigued trend turned firm. This operation may have other purposes. As a result, this month was 3 fen better than the previous day, November was 2 fen better, December was 3 fen better, and January, February, and March were 2 fen better. The current wheat market price is stable due to inspection issues. The procedures and costs of inspection have not yet been resolved and expect several days of negotiations. 6,300 bags of Shandong white wheat, Suzhou Yaowan Dangshan Huangqiao Suqian wheat were opened, purchased by Shenda and other factories.</p>
<h3>Customer Glutinous Rice Slightly More Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of customer glutinous rice was still scarce, but customer transactions were slightly more active. For example, the Ningbo gang purchased medium-quality rice, while the Xiamen gang selected high-quality goods among the early and late varieties of mechanical rice. However, the number of sales was small, only a few hundred bags. Township merchants in the main street continued to have social engagements, and the total market transactions included 1,600 bags of Jiangxi mechanical early rice, priced at 10.075 yuan, 10.02 yuan to 9.65 yuan, and 500 bags of mechanical late rice, priced at 12.6 yuan to 11.94 yuan, and 114 bags of pure rice, priced at 7.2 yuan. Foreign rice was affected by customer glutinous rice and Dumai rice, and has not yet been favored. The No. 1 Saigon importer only offered 13 yuan, but the cost of the owner was high, and they needed to sell it for at least 13.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Wuxi White Silk Factory Silk Smoothly Transported to Shanghai</p>
<p>The silk industry in Wuxi has been extremely sluggish in overseas sales of factory silk recently. The financial losses are so huge that they are unable to maintain operations and will inevitably go bankrupt. As the public inspection has not yet been cancelled, the industry has agreed to take the same actions as the Shanghai manufacturers and has formed an alliance to suspend operations. All factory's current month's futures silk sold to foreign firms should be delivered early. Therefore, Wuxi passenger vehicles have been transporting white factory silk to Shanghai in recent days. Since the start of the previous week, the amount of silk transported has reached 345 packages.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Factory Silk Production Reduced, Prices Increased</h3>
<p>After the alliance strike of Shanghai silk factories, the silk factories of other ports responded and took consistent steps. Silk production decreased daily, and the situation became more concentrated. The factories maintained a firm attitude and increased prices. Yesterday, Dachang and others imported 30 packages of Shanghai white factory silk from November and December, and Xinshichang and others imported 15 packages of Baiqian silk. The prices of both increased firmly.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Smooth and Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Gongxi green tea and Ningzhou black tea from various factories at the Shanghai port continued to attract strong interest from the Russian Assistance Association, but the recognized prices were also very strict, and the transactions decreased slightly. There were no large sales routes for Zhenmei and Zhenmei tea to British and French factories. Large group green tea was completely stagnant, and the trend in the tea market was still difficult to consider optimistic.</p>
<p>Zhabei Goods, Current Prices of Wood Ear, Disconnect from the Hankou Market</p>
<p>According to the telegram from Hankou, superior wood ear was 154 taels and miscellaneous wood ear was 103 taels, making it difficult to coordinate with Shanghai. Therefore, sources were scarce. Occasional customer goods arrived here, and the prices were more favorable. Miscellaneous wood ear was 103-4 taels, with slight reductions for inferior quality. In terms of sales routes, both the Hong Kong and Guangdong gangs were watching and not moving. Other gangs only had sporadic transactions. Yesterday's market price for superior wood ear was 165 taels, with the native brand at 110-108 taels, and miscellaneous wood ear at 105 taels. The market situation was flat and tired.</p>
<p>Sugar Market Trends Upward</p>
<p>Yesterday, the telegram from the sugar production area stated that the current price of Cuban sugar was 1.15625, an increase of .3125 from the previous telegram. The December price of New York sugar was 1.18, and the March price was 1.28, each up 3 points. The May price was 1.34, and the September price was 1.48, each up 2 points. The prices of both current and futures Javanese sugar did not increase or decrease. Although the buying interest in public crude white sugar was low, the market was still able to stabilize. The price of new goods was still 8 taels, and the price of Hehang goods was 8.05 taels, with the higher priced goods at 8.1 qian, with some transactions. Ground fine white sugar was 8 taels, No. 20 medium white sugar was 7.45 qian, and No. 8 Dutch red was 6.3 qian. Transactions decreased. Because the inventory of Japanese sugar turned thin and the startup date for the Minghua factory was still pending, the sales route was still active in sporadic amounts. Therefore, the market situation gradually turned upward. N sugar 7.95 qian, SH 7.725 qian, 8.1 qian, YR 7.55 qian, YT 7.775 qian, YPO 7.975 qian. The future market was stable up to 8 taels. Huaxin listed current No. 8 Dutch red sugar for sale in the board, selling several hundred bags for 6.3 qian, with slightly higher priced ones at 6.35 qian. The demand was not strong, but the market was not unusual.</p>
<p>Hardware English White Iron Goods Scarce, Prices High</p>
<p>Recently, the inventory of English white iron goods has been shallow, and the sources have been scarce. Therefore, buyers have no goods to buy, and the number of hopefuls is increasing daily. The standard is increasing daily. The current market price is 12.5 qian per dan for No. 22, 12.25 qian for No. 24, 14 qian for No. 26, 14.75 qian for No. 28, and 16.25 qian for No. 31. It has been found that the Yangtze River, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and the construction gangs in this street have all made purchases. Therefore, the amount opened in recent days has been 400-500 dan. The opened goods are mostly No. 26 and No. 28.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: 60,000 yuan in current foreign currency was shipped to Hankou.</p>
<p>420 boxes of silk were shipped to England.</p>
<p>3,700 tons of Dutch sugar have arrived.</p>

<h3>Business News</h3>
<p>Fushou Pharmacy at the intersection of Fourth Malu and Wangping Street claims that this medicine was originally founded as a one-dime medicine, which is quite popular among the public. Now, it has continued to produce phlegm-resolving dew, eyewash, detoxification water, mouth fragrance dew, oil-removing hair water, and other products on the market. Each bottle is still sold for a dime, it is said.</p>
<p>Yong'an Sock Factory claims that this factory is the largest sock factory newly established in Shanghai. It is now opened in Xiaodongmen Dongmen Road, with a three-story, magnificent, and tall building built by itself. The facade is inlaid with a very accurate self-ringing clock to facilitate travelers to work on time. The socks produced by this factory are obtained from experience and are exceptionally exquisite. There are also two newly invented silk socks, named economic socks, which are cheap and durable, and are indeed unique in the market. It is now scheduled to open on October 17th, with special gifts available, and there will definitely be a lively scene at that time, it is said.</p>
<p>Xinhua Clock and Watch Company claims that this company has always done wholesale business.

It is scheduled to officially open on the Double Ten Day. All kinds of styles are complete, and they are sold at low prices. For example, women's gold-plated watches are sold for only two yuan and five dimes each. There are many other famous factory clocks and watches. During the opening period, prices are also reduced across the board to commemorate the occasion, it is said.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>

Therefore, the seats have always been full. Now, during the National Day celebrations, all industries and schools are on holiday. Our theater will specially screen, starting today, the two-part "Burning of the Seven-Star Tower," also known as "Great Disturbance at Xuanqing Temple." The transformations, flying swords, and other concepts in it are uniquely conceived, and there are also fragrant and sensual performances, which are said to be even more spectacular than previous installments.</p>
<p>The Star Film Company announces: Our company's greatest production of the year, the play "Peach Blossom Lake," is directed by Zheng Zhengqiu, with Cai Chusheng as assistant director and Yan Hemian as the cinematographer. We have put forth our full effort in every aspect of the play, hoping to bring glory to domestic films. A trial screening was held at the Central Theater on the 2nd, and all those in attendance were prominent figures. Appreciating the plot of the entire play, the director's flexible skills, the beautification of the background, and the harmony of the lighting, all praised it as an unprecedented masterpiece in recent years of domestic films. The film has been scheduled to open at the Central Theater starting today and is expected to be very satisfying. Those who love watching good movies should take this opportunity to see it first, and so on.</p>
<p>The Fudan Film Company announces: Our company's fourth installment of "Burning of the Seven-Star Tower" has now been filmed. After the fifth installment is completed, the two installments can be screened one after another. These two installments star Ms. Hu Shan and are even more exciting than the previous installments. Director Yu Boyan has put tremendous effort into this film, and the other staff members have also been extremely busy. After filming the fifth installment, the "A" team decided to continue filming the sixth installment, while the "B" team will film a new film separately and proceed simultaneously. There have been many changes in personnel in various departments, and those invited are all people with experience and interest in film. In the future, when the film is released, the audience will be unexpectedly satisfied, and so on.</p>
<p>The Universal Film Company announces: Following our second production, "Hero," the plot is bizarre and tortuous, and the value is expensive. The filming of this film cost approximately over 15,000 yuan. Over 600 actors are needed. In addition to the basic actors, there is still a shortage of over 300 important roles. We are now actively seeking them. There is a great crowd of applicants, and the deadline is set for the 15th of this month.
