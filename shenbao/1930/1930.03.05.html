<p>時評</p>
<h3>印度非武力反抗</h3>
<p>世界偉大之民族。其最足以顯其特有之精神者。每於革命時見之。法國之革命。足以見獵丁民族之精神。俄國之革命。足以見斯拉夫民族之精神今之印度非武力抵抗。亦即印度民族之精神也。</p>
<p>民族之習慣。則於其民族中普遍之人民見之。民族之精神。則非於民族之人人或於平時。所能習見。必至於困苦顚離之後。千迴百折。始有若干民族中之健者。創立最合於其民俗性情之說。迭相傳布。經民族多數人之公認然後其說確定。革命之基礎已成。而民族特有之精神。亦於以發揚焉。</p>
<p>今日印度非武力反抗之方法。最適宜於印度民族之性情。亦即印度民族固有精神之所寄也。以印度歷來宗敎所感化。以及環境與本身之地位均屬最爲適宜之點。故印人而能寄此不舍。日進無已。必有能如其志願以獲得自由之目的者。</p>
<p>人類最大之力量是在精神。一民族而能用其特有之精神。奮進不已終必無堅不破。無强勿摧。奚必堅甲利兵而始爲有力哉。</p>

<p>以造成其一人之私勢力耳、區區之愚、以爲公旣願平心靜氣、與濬討論、國利民福、則兩害相權、而取其輕、應請先將并門一團鬼蜮、立即驅逐、自行閉門一思、方可從容協商、迫切陳詞、惟詳察賜覆是禱等語、並呈、職成濬叩支、（四日專電）</p>

<p>▲子－父親。你的咖啡中。方糖加得太多了。我只須兩塊已夠。</p>

<h3>愛迪生氏習尙談</h3>
<p>— 陳元良</p>
<p>客窗無俚。偶閱上月份美國雜誌中關於發明家愛迪生氏一文。而其材料則出諸其夫人之口。彌饒興趣。爰譯之如後。以供讀者談助。</p>
<p>愛迪生氏年事雖高。而其性情猶類童稚。豈眞還童返老爲壽者之徵象歟。氏出門之前。恒與其夫人接吻。數十載如一日。相沿成習。夫人亦必送之至門外。爲作簡單之話别。其情好綦篤。有如是者。近來氏每注意於橡皮事業。故其家中乃一變而充满橡皮空氣。所談所想甚至所夢。莫不橡皮。氏雖喜啖山薯。但以年齡關係。對之每有戒心。藥石之類。則嫉視如仇。氏喜觀音樂襯配之滑稽戲劇。及曼麗壁克馥或克萊拉寳主演之舊式影片。對於有聲電影。却少興趣。氏稱高爾夫球及跳舞等。乃飽食終日者流之娱樂品耳。氏生平不喜作書函。雖老友Harvey　Fireatone頻頻與彼通函。竟亦置之不答。其對於福特君極深欽佩。按福特爲美國汽車大王亦發明家之一。惺惺相惜。良有以也。氏對節目。漫不加意。即聖誕并自已誕辰。或結婚紀念。亦視若平日。平素喜御舊式襯衫。惟需綢製。蓋皮膚喜與綢質接觸。愛其輕滑貼肌。其夫人每年必以極軟之印度綢。親製手絹一盒。每塊約一碼見方餘。蓋迎合其旨趣也。居恒讀書。極崇拜法人嚣俄氏Victor　Hugo之作品。稱爲歷來著作家頭腦之偉大。無有出其右者。對伊所著Les　Miserable及Toilers　of　the　Sea兩書。及其詩篇。尤爲酷愛。暇輒諷誦吟哦。愛氏家人。對其座椅。視爲聖物。含有神秘作用。他人從未一坐。氏於每日晨報。亦不允他人先彼翻閱。上述種種。皆爲其素習也。</p>
<h3>記仰光流浪兒童寄宿所</h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>國中于窮無所依之兒童。有貧兒院苦兒院撫養敎育之。其孩提失所憑藉者。有育嬰堂之設。南洋仰光埠華僑巨子。鑒於躑躅街頭之流浪兒童。餐風宿露。情殊可憫。爰有寄宿所之創辦。用記其事。以爲國人告焉。</p>
<p>該所發起於客歲暮春。於十九年一月間。方宣告開幕。費時雖若干越月。然不得謂其進行遲緩。蓋初步在勸募新屋建築費。及常年基金準備。多方經營。始見端緒。經濟旣有著。搆造復需時。最後乃擇該埠舊醫院南首隙地。長一百尺。寬九十尺。計建大廳一座。廚房一所。書室一所。沐浴間盥漱室兩所。工業場若干間。由政府供建築費。發起人担任基金勸募。市政廳捐銀二千五百盾。缅甸婦女協會助銀六千二百盾。設總理一人。主任一人。事務出品工塲各一人。大廳日間備爲練習處。夜間即充臨時寢室。廳後空地一方。作爲運動塲。所收兒童七歲起。十六歲爲限。無家可歸。實係亦貧者。共容五百餘人。書室内并設有夜課。造就成材後。爲之另謀生計。該所切重體育。延聘專人敎授兒童體育。以適合身心健康爲標準。敦請名人爲經濟校董。以免中途停頓。開幕之日。已收兒童三百餘人。其組織之工廠。暫設漆木籐三工云。</p>
<h3>眞正廢物利用</h3>
<p>— 妍千</p>
<p>在述正文之先。請將眞正兩字作一簡單之解釋。以助讀者瞭解正文之旨趣。此處所謂眞正者。其意義乃與眞正老陸稿薦之眞正相同。並非含有若何神聖之意味也。</p>
<p>現在請述正文。今茲所謂廢物。乃眞正之廢物也。試問牛糞、貓糞、狗糞、鴿糞、非眞正之廢物乎。而傳聞皆可以之治疾病。則豈非眞正廢物利用乎。姑以吾所聞諸說。書付本談。就質于博學君子。</p>
<p>▲牛糞治臌脹說吾友伯勤君嘗告曰。童年曾患臌脹。家中老僕陳三。不知自何處訪得土方。於某日疊磗架瓦爲灶。置牛糞其上。燃薪炙之。謂將待其炙焦研末。使小主人服之。然卒經竭力反對。而止。</p>
<p>▲陳貓糞透痧子說最近有本埠之慈善團體。負責發表陳年貓糞透痧子之說。謂屋面貓糞之曾經冬季者。有透發小兒痧子之奇效。煎湯飲用。能奏殊功。爲保兒</p>
<p>聖劑云云。</p>
<p>▲白狗糞治喉症說幼時嘗見僕婦拾取白色狗糞。去其兩端。存其中段。曝日中。問何用。則曰貯以備急需。濟病者耳。又問何病須此爲藥。則曰白喉痧。其後亦未見其出以應用。故亦未知效騐若何。</p>
<p>▲鴿糞有益肺病說曾聞數人云。鴿糞易損屋瓦。但有益於肺病患者。故患肺病者靜養之所。宜多畜鴿云云。</p>
<h3>神乎其技之夏老鼠</h3>
<p>— 羽盦</p>
<p>我國固有之武技。誠令人不可思議。非目擊不敢置信。往往有奇才異能之士。寄跡於窮鄕僻壤。不求聞達。甘與草木同腐。致一生不爲世所知者。歷觀載籍與報端所記。蓋不知其如干數。何今日即成廣陵散。不復再見也。偶讀某君筆記便憶吾鄕（吳陵）亦嘗有一人。氏夏。名號已佚。以其人身材短小。且善於跳擲也。當時咸呼之爲老鼠。故至今夏老鼠三字。猶膾炙於吾鄕人士之口。而眞名轉隠先王父裕隆公曾爲予述其軼事云。老鼠長於運氣。練鐡布衫。能裸體令人以鐡械任意擊之。彼兀立不動。械着之處。肌肉輙墳然如核狀。隨械擊以起。而即以此墳然之核禦械擊。不能傷其體分毫也。再擊之。依然有一核。如響斯應。脫舉械就其核猛擊。核且漲大而有反激力。擊之者用力過猛。往往失足受反激而踣。彼嘗與人戲。將全身之氣。運集於兩耳。堅如鐡石。竭數人之力。　之不少動。其運氣工深。有如此者。時某地有一老敎師。亦負絕技。慕老鼠名。特來吾鄕訪之。有較量之意。老鼠則遜謝不遑。已而爲好事者所慫恿。相偕至光孝寺一角。光孝寺在城内。爲吾鄕最大之寺廟。至爲寬敝。而殿宇又經新葺。異常堅實。兩人旣至。相將立於殿墀之上。觀者如堵。某敎師頗傲。謂老鼠曰。君知我武技乎。請熟計之。毋貽譏於人。有損盛譽也。老鼠仍謙遜曰。然則請先示一二。老敎師曰。佳。乃舉手自握其髪辫。徐向上提之。兩足竟隨之離地。至三尺許。然後去其手。而兩足亦應手落地。𥒐然有聲。若懸繩中斷然。觀者嘖嘖稱異。老敎師意得曰。何如。老鼠忽向之一揖。曰。君技已臻化境。甘拜下風矣。言已。返身趨至墻壁前。倒臥於地。以其頭鑽壁。此壁下半爲靑石所砌。尤堅實。倐忽之間。石破而老鼠已置身壁外。更由壁外探首壁内。謂觀衆曰。我技弱。不敢輕試。去矣。請諸君解囊。爲僧人補修此穴。觀者更歡呼稱絕。蓋其穴之口。不及徑尺。又當一石之中。作　圓形。若爲石匠從容所鑿也者。常人且不能以全身進出。而老鼠竟以頭鑽石。隨鑽隨出。一刹那之頃。穴成而已置身壁外。誠神乎其技矣。回視老敎師。則面色慘沮。無復爾時傲岸。惘惘出寺門而去。雖然。老鼠固神乎其技。而老敎師又豈弱者哉。</p>
<h3>記李義元事</h3>
<p>— 傅琴心</p>
<p>吾國自庚子以還。朝野震懾。談及外人輒掩耳疾走。若辟兕虎。近雖稍悟疇昔之非。思有以雪恥者。然皆千百爲羣。藉於團體行動。絕未聞激於義憤。以匹夫抗之。猶有餘怒者。歲甲子。居京師。聞李義元事。其義勇誠足以廉頑立懦。亟記之。以風吾民。</p>
<p>李義元。直頴宛平人。多膂力。善馳驅。窮無所依。頴某部下爲騎兵。一日自崇文門外步夕陽歸。見一英兵。立陴上。挺身長嘯。慕之。趨而登。英兵阻不使進。義叱之曰。斯吾士。若何人。敢無禮耶。因掊之。且傷。英兵跡聲麕至。環捕之。義瞋目視之曰。無須爾。吾且欲面爾使理曲直。李義元豈畏人者耶。英兵乃擁之去。是夕。英使牒吾政府。請嚴懲義。政府不能却。使宛平令鞫焉。卒格於外人勢。下義三月獄。釋之日。集署迎者數千人。</p>
<h3>滑稽常識</h3>
<p>— 涂紅霞</p>
<p>▲吸上等的紙烟。先吸没有字的一頭。留着商標以表示紙烟的好。吸下等的紙烟。先吸有字的一頭。可以遮掩紙烟的壞。免得被人說窮酸。</p>
<p>▲穿了不好的衣服。可以走小道。以防朋友的看見。穿了好衣服。可以走大路。以求朋友的看見。</p>
<p>▲現在流行的手提皮包。東西愈裝得多。愈見得公文信件的多。要是没有東西可以裝。儘管裝兩件小掛褲。買兩刀草紙裝裝。以撑塲面。</p>
<p>▲走在馬路上。儘管無事。也要裝着急匆匆的。以表示公事的忙碌。</p>
<p>▲進當典的時候。要四面張望。以防朋友們看見。出當典的時候。可以不必。因爲那時只有一張當票。隨處都可以收藏。萬一恰巧遇見朋友。可以說。（今天没有事。到裏面逛逛）。</p>
<h3>心上温韾（一四一）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第九回　諸名士閙笑捉迷藏一嬌娘任情施擁護　　詩晨也初不料一個蓬頭赤脚的鄕下小姑娘。。長得漸漸的美麗起來。而且近來又漸漸的活潑起來。。這完全不是初見時候那種拘束那種矜持了。。伊對於别個客人。。厮熟了以後。。或者也是那種嬌憨的態度。。可是在詩晨那時的心理。。覺得蕊雲和他人是十分不拘束不客氣了。。有時左詩晨到他們那裏。。見蕊雲没有回來。。便和大阿姨敷衍談話。。大阿姨總是規規矩矩。。呼他爲左二少。。蕊雲回來時。。笑着道。。什麽左二少。。左詩晨便是左詩晨就是了。。　大阿姨道。。我們的阿囡。。總是那樣嘸淸嘸頭的。。好在左二少也不會作你小孩子的准的。。換了别一個客人。。不要光火嗎。。蕊雲道。。不能叫他的名字嗎。。我偏要呌。。爲什麽他却喚我蕊雲呢。。詩晨道。。你儘管連名搭姓呌好了。。不然。。世界上的人。。爲什麽要有一個姓。。爲什麽各人要有一個名字。。就是預備給人呌的呀。。蕊雲道。。那末以後我竟不客氣連名搭姓。。呌你左詩晨了。。　詩晨道。。好得很。。雖然如此說。。蕊雲出堂唱。。到了檯面上。。雖不呌左二少。。也不呌左詩晨。。因爲伊向來是不肯呌人的。。這個脾氣。。倒有些和泥塑美人。。　磕不開的甏。。小辫子陳綽雲有些相似。不過伊不說話。便默坐在傍邊。兩個似漆的眼珠。骨碌碌的向四周圍看。要是和鬭蟋蟀一般。引開了伊的牙鉗。伊就可以和開了話匣似的。說個不完。有一天。是詩晨的一個同鄕。六十歲做正壽。這位老太爺。雖然是六十歲了。他却是老輩風流。在堂子裏打牌。一連可以打二十四圈。他並不告饒。並不說一聲兒腰骨　酸。他生日的那一天。許多人提倡呌局。越呌得多越好。說是要閙一個萬花獻壽。那位壽翁。也儘他們閙去。其中有兩個熟人。知道左詩晨是叫花蕊雲的。也就不必問本人的同意了。便給他寫了局票。發了出去了。那時一個大廳上。擺了八席酒。而來賓又非常的多。於是書房裏啊。書樓上啊。都擺了酒席。左詩晨却坐在書房中一個壁角裏。蕊雲來了。先在大廳上轉了一轉。那天因爲阿金到别處去了。是伊一個人來的。伊找不到左詩晨。人家說不在廳上。或許在書房裏。蕊雲在書房門口一張。也没有見詩晨。伊心中有些急了。便嚷左詩晨在那裏。我是左詩晨呌的呀。喂左詩晨來了嗎。伊如此一嚷。人家都用一種奇異的目光。注視着伊。</p>

<p>▲後市最高曾到五百十一兩、後市開盤即高至四百九十九兩、次爲五百兩、復爲九十七兩市况迷亂不堪、惟趨勢向上、蓋現銀進口稅、不致實行、且恒興等大户買意頗厚、人心頓呈堅昻以後匯票亦緊、六月英金銀行對做十一便士零六二五、入後住友買十便士八七五、上海買十便士八七五至八一二五、六月日金以一零五八七五可賣、若向結者計一兩零六分以上、有此種種原由、足以引起佳况也、一跳千丈、計猛漲十三四兩、至三點半爲五百十一兩、後賣者重見敏活、遂向下游、但亦什亂無章、至三點三刻止竟有八九兩上落、旋後由五百零二兩、復高至五百零七兩、實乃以檯面上買賣多寡爲轉移、至四點一刻以後略遜一兩餘、四點三十分收市爲五百零五兩八錢、此較前日計回漲十兩零三錢、故交易所舉行雙結價</p>

<h3>厘市微挺拆價仍弱</h3>
<p>▲市塲槪况昨日市場中洋市比較往日略盛故市價稍稍堅利、銀根形勢、按諸上年現底支絀時、以前日發生裕大莊擱淺風潮之影響、業中人彼此吃緊、難免遞漲、無如現在拆票、已改獨天、現銀盈倉满庫、且該莊對同行拆票、早已償還、亦無絲毫影響、故昨日銀拆情形、與往日無所更變、不過同業中稍稍自愼而已、</p>

<p>▲滬南河下來船不多、走銷淸淡、常錫機粳去化較殷、然買方喝盤甚緊、價格無若何上落、蘇白粳銷場沉寂、貨客因久守無益、頗有速售意、奈進胃微細、故交易寥寥、大盤軟去近角、本帮重固·泗涇等薄早稻、走銷依然甚呆、而少數貨主尙欲板售、惟亦有隨市者、但情况始終不振、祇高貨稍有交易而已、羊秈埠秈甬通帮揀高採辦、本街胃口有限、市價穏定、白元銷化又靜、内地到貨仍聯、價格有趨下之勢、</p>
<h3>標金控制下之粉市</h3>

<h3>蓬蓬勃勃之美國汽車事業黄·影·呆·</h3>
<p>▲歇業工人均由廠方召回</p>
<p>▲十六缸車業已公開展覽</p>
<p>美國之汽車事業。向執全世界之牛耳。迄今銷路方面。仍爲歐西各國所不及。回憶過去一年之中。美國有若干廠家。不無生産過剩之象。於是一般庸人。咸謂本年美國之汽車事業。勢將一蹶不振。按諸事實。則此種預測。已歸失敗。當舊年辭别。新年替代之時。美國各汽車廠。工作突然緊張。一般辭歇之工人。咸應召回廠。從事製造新車。蓋在各廠新車未經製成之初。各地商人。已紛紛來函訂購。訂貨之單。各廠陸續收到。設非加工趕造。則必供不應求矣。本年美國各廠之營業政策。利用車價之低减。以作競爭之良法。然有少數車輛。因成本關係。售價非但不减。反而增加。加笛拉克加價於先。畢克與馬克德加價於後。前者所加之價。自美金一百元至三百元。而後者則自二十五元至七十五元。上述之價。乃由司鐡龍及畢克兩廠定盤。據兩廠所言。本年之新車。因成本之高貴。售價不得不略事增加。而新車之内容。其價値當數倍於增加之價額也。</p>
<p>當兩廠加價之時。各廠新車。大都未經製成。故售價亦未確定。以大勢而言。其中將新車之價格减低者。亦屬不少。當紐約萬國汽車展覽會開幕之時。各廠新車。咸參加陳列。式樣之新頴。機件之優良。實爲舊車所不及。他如汽缸之加多。採用前輪拖曳式。均爲本年新車之新趨勢也。其他小號小車輛。大多與一九二九式相同。惟車身及底盤。略事改良耳。至於售價方面。則並未變更。一言以蔽之。美國各汽車廠之工程師及機匠。本年咸竭其全力。從事製車。俾出品之優良。而堪與他廠競爭。攫得一九三。年汽車市塲上之相當地位。内容方面。雖無重大之改革。然以實用而言。則較舊車爲神速而完美也。故廠家方面。在特殊情形之下。因成本之關係。不得不將售價增高也。</p>
<p>在紐約汽車展覽會中。有一汽車。最足令人注意者。乃加笛拉克之十六汽缸車也。蓋此種多汽缸汽車。雖已喧傳一時。而公開展覽。尙屬初次也。陳列之新車。牌號爲加笛拉克Ｖ－Ｉ6。經三年之研究。始得製造成功。車身之漂亮。得未曾有。駕駛之時。安全穏快。而力量之濃厚。又爲任何車輛所不及。自加笛拉克Ｖ字十六汽缸新車製成之後。有若干廠家。亦相率仿製。從此汽車市塲之上。又將多添一種多汽缸汽車矣。將來如有求過於供之現象。則各廠均擬製造。至於此種新車之售價。則今日尙未定當。預料必爲高價汽車中之最貴者也。司帝倍克廠之新車。加入紐約汽車展覽會者。以大奈蜜克牌新歐斯康爲最佳。此種車輛。完全用新法製造。車身長大無比。軸基之長度。有一一四寸之多。採用新式减熱裝置。據廠方所言。大槪新車之售價。可編入一千元之汽車類内。以本年汽車事業而言。則八汽缸車之銷路。將一躍而居於六缸之上。當此冬盡春初之際。各汽車廠對於本年之營業。大都已有相當之把握。而車輛之售價。又復竭力减低。此及又有利於顧客者也。</p>
<h3>今年我國汽車事業應有之努力石·重·之·</h3>
<p>光陰如箭。十九年於今始矣。回憶過去一年之中。我國汽車事業。雖當國家訓政開始。又値地方多事之秋。政府當局。忙於調兵遣將。軍書旁午。鮮有餘暇。加以提倡。徒令一切偉大計劃。適成畫餅充飢而已。其乏顯著之進步。蓋非無因也。然以本埠而論。卒有福特公司。設立汽車裝配廠於浦東。通用公司。繼之分立華行。開設汽車學校。并擬於楊樹浦附近。購地若干。以備建築支廠之用。大陸自建新屋。别克另組公司。凡此足徵過去一年之中。非無相當進展也。蓋汽車事業之於今日。應時勢之需要。方興未艾。其在我華。縱或因當地環境之關係。暫時稍受影響。此外如各大商埠。未受軍事波及。則其營業。方蒸蒸日上也。即如本埠汽車出租一業。突飛猛進。一年之内。車行林立。服務周至。取費低廉。或慮其一時雖風起雲湧。不久將烟消霧散。鳥知此非其他投機事業可比。與其謂難免失敗。曷若言容易普及。行見數年之内。人力車當逐漸淘汰也。顧此不過就一二商埠而言。若論全國。允宜聯合各省。以建築道路。爲刻不容緩之圖。其次。舉辦長途汽車。以利内地交通。務使全國路線。密如蛛網。四通八達。無遠弗届。然後一切訓政事宜。得以次第實現。舉其大者。例如軍隊剿匪。普及敎育。賑災救荒。無往而不受其利。凡此數端。雖或火車交通。亦能勝任。然建築鐡道。不特費用浩大。抑且工程繁劇。不若汽車路之經費省而舉辦易也。頗聞國府當局。有借外資以從事建築鐡道之議。何如舉其省者易者。况路成之後。當地汽車經營。大可招商承辦。計莫善於此。雖然。近年以來。汽車進口。苟一翻閱海關統計。爲數頗足驚人。金錢外溢。言之痛心。長此以往。漏巵實大。爲今之計。一方儘宜及早糾集資本。設廠製造。工程師不妨聘請外人。原料當先採用國産。或與外商訂立合同。合資經營。一方有志之士。儘宜研究汽車製造。將來出其所學。貢獻社會。殆亦努力於實業救國之一途也。</p>
<h3>萬人空巷看新車霖</h3>
<p>▲今年别克新車已出世</p>
<p>▲新車模型計共十四種</p>
<p>别克汽車以製作精良。式樣優美。鳴於時。每當新車出世。萬人爭傳。莫不以先覩爲快。一千九百三十年之模型。業已齊備。計共有十四種之多。消息傳出之日。全美各地之别克樣子間。觀光者勢如潮湧。其尤甚者爲紐約之百老匯及五十五街。幾於户限爲穿也。别克汽車之新樣。通常於每歲八月節公佈之。凡屬汽車界中人。莫不視爲盛事。至於今年亦與往昔無異。而於新車問世之外。又有减價之舉。更不得不謂之異數也。緣米西根佛林脫廠中。曾電知各地。輪底加長之各種汽車。價格上均有相當之减削。惟短輪底之各車。則因馬力及機械上之革新甚多。亦不能不略有增價云。</p>
<p>今年别克牌之各種新車。於向來固有之優點。仍保持無遺外。其式樣視一九二九年者。無不多所更改。不過精益求精。新車之外廓線條·力臻上乘·無瑕可指。車形卓越。别具獨有之風格。射熱器之外壳較前尤爲修削。另加門塞。車首前之排障器亦視前圓轉。車之全身並帶形之圜箍。益形美觀。有上述種種之特點。是以一經觀覽。無贊美也。各種新車模型又因輪底加長。其車身亦因之而增長。全車美觀更非昔比。新車車頂。因車身旣經加長。故減低一英寸。以資相稱。其下面之車座亦採用半　圓形彈簧而減削一英寸。故後車座乃略下陷。有此更改。新車不期而減低兩英寸。速度及使用上均蒙其利。輪底之增大爲今年新車　造上之堪以注意者。大模型車昔爲一百二十九英寸者。現在增至一百三十二英寸。中模型本爲一百二十一英寸。現擴大至一百二十四英寸。小模型由一百十六英寸增至一百十八英寸。</p>
<p>新車機力之大速率之快。昔年之别克汽車難望其項背。大號新車採用汽門在機蓋内式。其馬力有九十八匹之巨。較次者亦增至八十一又五匹馬力。上述兩種　車之馬力。在一九二九年之别克車爲九十一又五匹馬力。及七址四匹馬力是也。馬力增加之由來。乃由於馬托兩旁之鑽孔。增加八分之一英寸所致。各種新車模型之速率。總在每小時七十英里之外。他若爬山及移重之能力亦大有增長。機搆方面則凡屬機械上之進步。别克汽車無不採用之者。其中包括四輪内張式制動機。此種煞車蓋爲最平穏最善良者。亦汽車駕駛上之一利器也。</p>
<p>駕駛炎便捷尤爲特色。因採用完全可以校正之輪轉式駕駛輪是也。車前左面之前進彈簧端裝有特震動減少器。此器不論於何種方面。因繞盤彈簧之故而動作極微細。舵輪上無論何種之路震故</p>
<p>盛種此器之利便。新車尙有簡單之特色一種。即採用半　形彈簧是也。亦即雙動水震退减器之進步所致。凡車行時之回跳震燙盪等動作均爲之减少。蓋因車内之活塞之裝置。能使各種之路行震跳咸歸於一致之動作也。車中人駕駛時之安適。不言可喻。别克新汽車卓之行動。均經通用汽車公司。别克車機師於試騐塲中。作精細及長時期之考騐。挑用每種新車中之四門轎車。每車均載重四百五十磅。短</p>
<p>輪底之兩種。六·四秒中每小時加速自五英里至二十五英里。大模型者八·七秒。上下山巔之試騐亦極有趣。三種模型均有相同之能力。四門轎車載重四百四十磅。在高一千四百尺。百分之十一方之斜度。試騐之丙種短模型者。以每小時二十六英里之速度到達山巔。途中隨時增加自每小時五英里起始。大號汽車亦受同樣之測騐上巔之時每小時得二十五英里。紐約省中凡屬大道其斜度不得逾百分之六·五。斯則亦可注意者也。測騐速度時塲中各汽車每小時逾七十英里者。比比皆是。其引擎動作之低爲前此各摩托所不及。</p>
<p>測騐小車時又發現燃料之節省爲一九二九年各模型所不及。其故因車身之重量與引擎力量相等也。大號汽車之馬力雖加而燃料之消耗固未有增加。集中式之滑油系。發明於前年。此次新車各模型亦採用之。得到無上之满意。蓋用此種滑油系得於短時間中滑潤各部而略無煩瑣新車顔色各種不同。色彩調和與式樣互相美。車廂内座墊簾幙等顔色均與車身所髹之色彩相配。斯則又合於女界之需要也。新模型各車之内廂由飛休廠造因配置得宜十分動人。座墊簾幙等用一種特織之羊毛绢絨。地避水布爲地。甚屬經久耐用。以前者高出數倍。且於污垢者又</p>
<p>能洗滌。各車廂内大半裝有烟灰盒及空箱。一切銅木用具均係别克所特創者。對於内部裝飾相形益臻完美。坐座及駕駛坐之墊椅均可隨時高低校正。以適合各人之需要。座位之校正數秒鐘中即能解决。此外各部份亦均易於處置。總之别克新車式樣優美。管理便捷。爲不可多得者也。</p>
<h3>日本交通之科學管理（再續）林·英·楣·譯·</h3>
<p>二、交通管理器具之變遷</p>
<p>我國交通警察。成立僅逾十載。直隸於警視廳。因事屬創舉。當時覺驚奇。但近來交通頻繁。事故激增。市民之感想。亦隨之轉移。逐年以來。交通警察。有增無減渠等在風雨炎暑之下。大聲竭呼。手舞足蹈。以維持帝都之交通安全。其勤奮從公之精神。誠令人感謝不置。不過紛亂雜沓情形。却未因此而稍趨和緩。管理交通。不在於防止事故而已。交通之敏捷。速度之提高。亦不容忽視。欲防止交通事故。固可增加交通警察。但當此交通發達時代。敏捷速力。關係重大。而我國首部。尙無任何科學之設施。實深遺憾。歐美先進諸國。夙見及此發明科學的管理方法。旣可代警察之勞役。又可防止事故。試辦以來。成效卓著。美國對此問題。特别注意。各種主法設備不一而足。試述管理器具之變遷。以觀其梗槪。最初用木板二塊。上書（進止）字樣。警察高舉手中。以示行止。日前東京所用方法。即爲美國數十年前所採用者。可是都市興旺日盛。行人車馬之往來。亦隨之頻繁。甚至不分畫夜。通曉達旦。故此種管理器具。日間尚能勉强應用。夜間却失其効力。於是發明透明設備。以補其不足。爲指揮交通者之案全起見。復於道路中心。設立小鳥。一九一七年美國待圖辣城(Detriot)首先實行。惟占地位過大。交通上頗感障碍。最近建築則漸形狹小。</p>
<p>文字信號之表示方法。如（進止當心）等字樣。由近處觀之。尙無不便。但自遠方馳驅而來之汽車。欲辨别（進止）勢非緩和速力。注視信號不可。因此文字信號遂不適於時代之要求。</p>
<p>一九一八年。紐約市政當局發明紅綠黄三色信號。以代（進止當心）之文字信號。試用以來。成績優良。芝佳哥（Chicago）待圖辣(Detriot)各市。亦相纰採用。取</p>
<p>其日夜均能使用。且一望即知。而無徬徨遲延之虞。即此二端已爲拙劣幼稚之文字信號所望塵莫及。故一時風靡全球。世人稱便。　　三、有色信號在歐美之地位</p>
<p>有色信號在交通上之價値以及使用後所得莫大之恩惠。在美國業已充分證明。美國警察當局爲道德觀念所衝動。首先着眼於科學的管理法。以保護市民之安全。故督促誘導民營公司製造精美之管理器具不遺餘力。慘淡經營。卒奏大功。此種偉大精神。殊堪敬佩效法。</p>
<p>例如德京柏林之警察當局。每於通衢要道。建立高牌。詳示信號之用意。務使他市來客一望而知。甚至不惜犧牲。採用無線電。電影等種種方法。以訓練市民大衆。此外如加羅那州頒佈交通法規。排入中等學校之敎程。以鼓吹交通道德。其關心交通安全。實堪欽佩。</p>
<p>號稱科學發達之德國。對於有色信號在交通上之價値。亦不與否認。故自一九二六年起警察廳通令採用。以求撤底普及。有色信號自在美國街上出現以來。於極短促期間。已呈激劇普遍之象。惜其使用標準未及德國之劃一。故各自爲政。任意採用。不過大體上仍以紅燈表示停止。綠燈表示自由通行。此外尙有黄燈。各市亦兼有採用之者。現任大總統胡佛氏三年前任商務卿時。有鑒於此。發起美國工程會議在華盛頓召集第一次會議。提出交通管理燈。標幟燈之標準問題。翌年舉行第二次會議。遂規定統一標準。</p>
<p>有色信號在美國之普及。已如上述。其發達之迅速美人好奇心有以致之。例如哈佛大學特設TheAlbertRusselEiskinBureau交通工學。聘請麥克林博士</p>
<p>擔任指導。以研究交通學問。則美人對於交通觀念之篤實以及官民合作之誠意。不難窺見一班。</p>

<h3>浙省路政成績悟·非·</h3>
<p>▲民國十六年以後之建設</p>
<p>浙省對於水陸交通。夙有整個之計劃。而於公路設施。自民十六年後。已積極進行不遺餘力。茲將浙建廳所公布之歷年來路政成績。分述如次。</p>
<p>▲杭紹路（一）蕭紹段計長五十二、二公里。自民國十五年通車後。收入僅敷開支。及受戰事影響。車輛毁損不少。營業益形不振。自民國十六年冬加以整頓。添購車輛。修理路面。營業始漸進步。至十八年間則每日收入約一千一百餘元。現有大小車輛五十輛。貨車六輛。平均每日乘客一千八百人。行車三千七百餘会公里。耗汽油二百六十餘加倫。除開支約八百元外。日可赢利三百餘元。爲本省各汽車路之冠。此路之終點爲紹興西郭門。而爲商辦紹曹嵊路之起點。則在五雲門。相距七里半。不能㘅接。旅客甚感不便。因飭公路局趕築接綫。於去年五月間通車。自紹興站經昌安門至五雲門。路寬二十四尺半。路面用八寸原碎石。橋梁三座。共長六十五尺。涵洞三座。共計建築費七萬一千餘元。每里平均約一萬餘元。此後自杭州赴寗波。由蕭紹段直接紹曹嵊路之紹曹段。渡曹娥江。乘滬杭甬之甬曹火車。不及六小時即可達到。較之轉滬渡海費時糜財者其便利多多矣。（二）拱三段計長十三·八公里。於十七年八月通車。現有客車三十八輛。平均每日乘客四千餘人。行車一千四百餘公里。耗汽油八十餘加倫。每日收入約五百餘元。開支約三百元。日得赢利二百餘元。去年復因經過萬松嶺坡度太峻。擬鑿平百分之四。需費約一萬五千五百元。現正開鑿中。車輛暫由杭州市内繞過行駛。一俟工竣。則行車更爲安全矣。（三）錢塘江碼頭。查錢塘江義渡。舊有專局。以司其事。有小輪八艘。拖船二十三艘。惟兩岸各有漲沙。上下臨時架搭挑板。以免涉水。稍一不愼。墮落隨之。旅客最感痛苦。乃有建築碼頭之計劃。於民國十七年八月興工。於去年五月落成。計北岸碼頭長八百八十呎。闊十六呎。其前端則放闊爲三十八呎。長三十七呎。略成方形。作停車之塲。均用鐡筋水泥建築架橋。每十八呎爲一架。視地勢之高下。與土質之强弱。用二十六呎至三十八呎長一呎見方之鐡筋柱四枝。以托架梁及橋面。其橋面高度在高水位以上二呎。架橋前端復接六十呎長之鋼橋。以達於鋼製之方船。方船長八十呎闊二十呎。深二呎。吃水一呎。以鐡錬繫於四梅花椿。梅花椿之中椿。各長五丈方十四吋。中椿之外。各附以方十二吋長四十四呎之椿四枝。均爲木質。而以鋼板螺絲互相　緊。南岸計劃與北岸同。惟架橋長只九十英呎。前端不復施寬。而自架橋接岸之處。則新築石子路六十五呎。護以石坡。其兩碼頭進口處。均有雄壯之鐡筋混凝土牌樓一座。題額曰浙江第一碼頭。飾以電燈。架橋兩欄。亦有燈柱。照耀江中。不特便利行人。亦可增錢塘夜景之美。計共用銀九萬三千餘元。因拱三等蕭紹洪車後。杭紹交通。可成一貫。故即以錢塘義渡局有碼頭歸併於公路局管理。所以一事權而節經費也。</p>
<p>▲鄞奉路查奉化至寧波爲寧紹交通要道。故於十六年夏即奉令修路。經二年之久。迨於十八年五月。全路告竣。方始正式通車營業。本路自寗波至入山亭爲幹路。自江口至奉化城爲支路。共計長四十九。三公里。路寬二十四呎。路面用六寸厚碎石。橋梁四十三座。共長一千三百八十呎。最長者爲元貞橋二百四十四呎。江口橋三百三十九呎。涵洞三十一座。共計建築費七十三萬餘元。</p>
<p>▲杭富路是路初由商辦杭富汽車公司以三十萬元。經費承築通車。因遭逢戰事。損失最鉅。一蹶不可復振。於十七年十月以十二萬三千一百八十二元六角四分之價欵收回。暫停營業。從事修理。於去年中工程漸次告竣。已逐段通路矣。</p>
<p>▲杭長路本路爲路綫網之第五經綫。亦即京杭公路之一段。自十七年六月開始測量。十月全段同時開工。於十八年十一月通車。全路長一百三十三·九公里。路寬二十四呎。共有橋梁八十座。以湖州西門橋及瓶窰橋工程爲最鉅。各長二百四十餘呎。涵洞一百四十三座。建築費預算一百二十一萬六千元。又此路尙有三橋埠至莫干山麓。廋村之支綫。長七○五公里。已於十八年六月中通車。由杭至莫干山兩小時可達。較前便利不少矣。</p>
<p>▲杭平路是路爲路綫網之第六路綫。亦即杭滬公路之一段。全長一百四十·四公里。自杭州至海寗。除原有商辦公路外。另築新路目袁化達平湖之一段。於十七年六月開始測量。於十八年一月開工。橋梁共五十座。涵洞七十四座。預算建築費五十萬元。現路基早已完成。橋工亦將告竣。不久即可通車也。</p>
<p>▲杭昌路此路全長一百三十·六里半。其由杭州至化龍鎭之七十一·六公里。已由商辦通車。自化龍鎭至昱頫　。於十八年已公公路局趕築。全路將届完竣。而通車之期。當不在遠矣。</p>
<p>▲紹平路此路自紹興至永嘉甌江之北岸。計長三百五十二公里。去年以經過地段。秋收荒歉。由省府撥欵五十萬元。以</p>

(2) Establish state-owned hydropower enterprises to reduce the cost of power and increase opportunities for industrial development. (3) Establish state-owned machine manufacturing plants to produce various machines needed by industries. (4) Establish state-owned refined salt plants, paying attention to manufacturing methods and improving the hygiene of people's edible salt.

I urgently hope that Committees Zhang and Li will come to Shanxi as soon as possible to investigate together, and the truth will become clear." (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Shang Zhen Telegraphed the Third Plenary Session</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Shang Zhen telegraphed the Third Plenary Session, saying, "The entire meeting originally intended to go to Beijing according to the telegram, but due to the complexity of Shanxi's political affairs, I am unable to attend the meeting." (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Recent Telegram Exchanges Between Yan and He</h3>
<p>Yan Asked for Understanding of His Difficulties ······ He Replied with a Final Admonition</p>
<p>(Hankou) Yan Xishan replied to He Chengjun's telegram on the 28th, saying, "I am deeply grateful that you are discussing the welfare and safety of the party and the country with a calm and peaceful mind. The reason why I have spoken so tirelessly is for the sake of the party and the country. If I were to speak from personal feelings, I have spoken to Mr. Jiang with tears in my eyes. You know me deeply and should be able to understand my difficulties." (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun replied to Yan's telegram, saying, "I am deeply impressed by your modesty after reading the telegram. However, what is called a calm and peaceful mind should comprehensively consider the facts and deliberate at length. I am grateful for your trust and consider myself your confidant. At this critical moment, I cannot help but shed tears and offer a final word of advice. I hope you will consider it carefully. Over the past year, the reorganized faction, the Communist Party, the Anfu clique, the Research Clique, and disgruntled military and political figures have gathered in Shanxi. These people are all taking advantage of the chaos in the world and have long wanted to spread their half-baked theories to the world. Unfortunately, there is no phonograph to broadcast them. Unexpectedly, you have fallen into their trap and are revealing everything without reservation. Even if these heterodox views succeed temporarily, you will gain a high position as a result, but placing venomous snakes and fierce beasts in one house, what kind of situation will that create? And the affairs of the country and the party will likely become more complicated. The so-called party members governing the party and the people governing the country will eventually be combined by you alone, and the complexity will inevitably be even greater than it is today. At that time, how painful will you be? It goes without saying. This is the first thing I must advise you on. The Northwest Army, in its past history,</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>India's Non-Violent Resistance</h3>
<p>The Great Nation of the World. What best demonstrates its unique spirit is seen during revolutions. The French Revolution is sufficient to see the spirit of the Latin nation. The Russian Revolution is sufficient to see the spirit of the Slavic nation. Today's Indian non-violent resistance is also the spirit of the Indian nation.</p>
<p>The habits of a nation are seen in the general population of that nation. The spirit of a nation cannot be commonly seen in every member of the nation or in ordinary times. It must be that after hardship and tribulation, and after numerous twists and turns, some strong individuals in the nation create theories that best suit the customs and sentiments of their people. These theories are passed down and widely disseminated and become recognized by the majority of the nation. Then the theories become established, and the foundation for revolution is laid. And the unique spirit of the nation is thus promoted.</p>
<p>Today, India's method of non-violent resistance is most suitable for the temperament of the Indian nation. It is also where the inherent spirit of the Indian nation resides. Because of the influence of religion throughout Indian history, and because the environment and its own position are all the most suitable points, the Indian people can rely on this and advance day by day, and will surely be able to achieve their goal of gaining freedom.</p>
<p>The greatest power of mankind lies in the spirit. A nation that can use its unique spirit and strive unceasingly will inevitably break through all defenses and crush all strengths. Why must it have strong armor and sharp weapons to be powerful?</p>
<p>Received Important Domestic Telegrams</p>
<p>How do you view Mr. Jiang? It is certainly debatable, but who was responsible for the disastrous defeat at Linluo last year? You should know it yourself. Even if we reluctantly join you at this time, the military expenses and supplies will inevitably have to be supplied by Shanxi. Allowing the land of your parents and hometown, which you have painstakingly managed for 20 years, to be drawn into the vortex and leave endless troubles for your descendants is truly heartbreaking. This is the second thing I must advise you on. In your repeated telegrams, the central government you have criticized has gone to extremes, leaving no room for compromise. Its premeditation is already clear. Moreover, based on the facts, it is heard that you have already taken the position of Commander-in-Chief, Feng Pengju's division has invaded Shandong, and a large army is gathering at Cangzhou Machang. Even the five divisions under my command have been instructed to list them in the combat sequence, according to repeated secret reports from the division commanders. In addition, the names of people from Hunan and Guizhou are falsely used in the telegrams. Moreover, the authorities of various provinces such as Hunan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan have also submitted to me the military plans secretly instructed by you. Is this what you call courtesy and deference to the country, discussing national affairs with a calm and peaceful mind? This is the third thing I must advise you on. In short, things in the world should not be viewed as too difficult, nor should they be viewed as too easy. But between the advantages and disadvantages, we must carefully consider the priorities. If you disregard everything and stir up military conflict, plotting rebellion, even if your plan can fully succeed, and the above-mentioned matters cannot be resolved, I am afraid that the day you succeed will be the day you become frustrated. In the future, the history of the Republic of China will surely write in large letters that Yan Xishan's so-called courtesy and deference to the country is nothing more than advancing by retreating to obtain the title of Commander-in-Chief, nothing more than sacrificing the lives and property of most people to expand his territory, nothing more than wanting to overthrow the Kuomintang, destroy unity,</p>
<p>To create his own private power. I believe that since you are willing to discuss national interests and people's welfare with me with a calm and peaceful mind, then between two evils, we should choose the lesser. I urge you to first expel the gang of demons in Shanxi immediately, close the door and think for yourself, and then we can calmly negotiate. I implore you to carefully examine and grant a reply.

<h3>Yan in Shanxi Has a Change of Heart</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Beijing Garrison Headquarters announced the Beiping support telegram: (1) According to news from Shanxi, Yan recently observed that the reactions of various parties to him were all hypocritical and perfunctory, and he deeply regretted it. Yesterday, he specifically discussed with Zhao Cilong methods to ease the rupture. The Wen Zhi faction in northern Shanxi took the opportunity to advise Yan, saying that the current method of remedy is to first transfer all the southern divisions back to their original defenses, reject the politicians of the Anfu Reorganization factions, adhere to Zhang Hanqing's peaceful unification proposition, cancel the fallacy of armed peace, and at the same time declare it to the country and abroad, so that it can be salvaged. (2) Shanxi paper currency once plummeted. Last month, it mortgaged reorganization public bonds for cash to maintain the currency price. Since Yan mobilized troops, bank cash has been continuously withdrawn. At present, the banking market is extremely short of funds, and the currency price has risen to 60%. (3) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Yan, saying that the people's livelihood is so painful at the moment that it is not appropriate to rashly start a war, leading to heavier people's hardship. He has ordered all divisions to withdraw to their original defenses and not be used by politicians. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Panic in the Japanese Market</h3>
<p>Significant Outflow of Cash</p>
<p>Sharp Drop in Various Stocks</p>
<p>Finance Minister States He Cannot Relax Austerity Policies</p>
<p>▲Reasons for the Stock Market Decline</p>
<p>General Public's Enthusiasm for Stocks Cools</p>
<p>Stockholders Anxiously Seek to Dispose of Shares</p>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 4th: Since the establishment of the Hamaguchi Cabinet, securities have gradually trended downward, with some falling as much as 50%. East Stock and Zhongfang Stock have fallen 20% compared to last August. Asano Cement Stock and Japan-Russia Fisheries Stock have fallen exactly 50%. The main reasons are that some strategists anticipated a cash outflow after the lifting of the gold embargo, hence the long-term speculative selling; the general public's enthusiasm for stocks has cooled; and stockholders, seeing prices falling daily, anxiously seek to dispose of shares. Due to these various factors, the stock market is weakening daily, and its impact on various aspects is significant.</p>
<h3>Statements from Political Parties</h3>
<p>Constitutional Democratic Party Discusses Countermeasures</p>
<p>Seiyūkai Blames the Government</p>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 4th: The Constitutional Democratic Party was thrown into disarray as the raw silk market and other markets all plummeted. Yesterday, an emergency general affairs meeting was held to discuss countermeasures. As a result, it was decided to request government relief. The Seiyūkai party believes that the current state of panic is entirely the responsibility of the government's austerity policies. Finance Minister Inoue told people that the fundamental causes of the recession were due to global conditions: raw silk due to the slump in the US market and the fall in silver prices, which benefited Chinese exports; cement due to weak demand and inadequate production cuts; and textiles due to the fall in silver prices, reduced Chinese sales power, and India's increased tariffs. Each has its own reasons, which led to the stock market decline. Currently, there is no need to be agitated by the panic. We must observe the actual situation with a calm eye. Although there is no material for improvement now, the stock market depends on sentiment and should not continue in this state forever. At present, for the financial world after the lifting of the gold embargo, apart from encouraging domestic production to seek fundamental recovery, we must not relax austerity policies. The government has no other good plans for this stock market. The investment trust planned by Mr. Okazaki and others, if it can be established, would be a good deed. The government can do its best to help with the selection of those in charge, but the establishment and management of the trust, by its nature, should not involve the government. We hope that the private sector will work hard to do it.</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Inoue's Opinion</h3>
<p>No Need to Worry About the Transitional Situation of Cash Flow</p>
<p>Stock Market Decline is Due to Various Negative Propaganda</p>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 4th: Recently, there has been a significant outflow of cash and a sharp decline in stocks. Finance Minister Inoue responded to questions from party members by saying: 1. Before the lifting of the gold embargo, when Citibank withdrew tens of millions of yen of foreign capital, the Bank of Japan sold foreign cash. After the lifting of the gold embargo, Citibank sent 40 million yen, and other banks also sent cash. Therefore, the current outflow of cash amounts to approximately 140 million yen. Of this, 60 million yen can be regarded as the repatriation of foreign capital and the payment of foreign debt interest, and the remaining 80 million yen can be regarded as being used for import overage settlements. As of the end of February, the import overage was 70 million yen. Because foreign exchange banks did not have cash reserves abroad, most of the 80 million yen was used for this purpose. Even after this, there will still be a considerable outflow of cash, but the total amount will not be very large. From now until July, it will be a period of export surplus, and cash will flow in. Foreign banks can use the inflow of funds in the second half of the year for settlements. In short, the outflow and inflow of cash should be viewed over the entire year, and there is no need to worry about the outflow during the transition period. 2. The stock market decline is due to various negative propaganda. The speeches of the Prime Minister and myself are deliberately presented as pessimistic to mislead the world. I hope that you will not be thrown into disarray by rumors regarding these matters. No relief measures were discussed for the stock market crash. It is planned to provide 50 million yen of financing for small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists. This fund will be disbursed by the Savings Bureau at an interest rate of 8% and handled by credit unions. Because it is unrelated to the parliament, it is planned to implement it immediately.</p>
<h3>Relief for the Sharp Decline in Silk Prices</h3>
<p>Items Desired by the Central Sericultural Association</p>
<p>Implementation of the Raw Silk Financing Guarantee Law</p>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 4th: Raw silk is Japan's major export product. Recently, silk prices have continued to plummet, sinking to the lowest prices since 1916. If left unattended, the foundation of the sericultural industry would be in danger. Therefore, Vice Chairman Kagayama of the Central Sericultural Association, Imai Gosuke, and Sawa Eiichi and others gathered at the association's office on the 3rd to discuss countermeasures. The forced storage of 50,000 bundles only leaves the inventory for the future. Not only is there no deterioration in the supply and demand relationship, but the credit for strong guarantees at home and abroad is also extremely weak. Due to the falling prices, the supply and demand relationship between Japan and the United States has recently changed, and forced storage can no longer be effective. Only the Silk Price Stabilization Financing Guarantee Law can be effective, so it is being promoted for implementation by Minister of Agriculture Machida. Minister Machida ordered the Silk Price Maintenance Committee to hold a meeting on the 5th to specifically deliberate on the procedures for submitting the guarantee law, the market situation since last year, and the relationship between strong guarantees and the guarantee law. It was also submitted to today's cabinet meeting to seek the understanding of cabinet members. Minister of Agriculture told people that the recent sharp decline in silk prices has caused those in the industry to seek various countermeasures without effect. Bad news fills the future, and the situation is getting worse. In order to save this crisis, I have made a final resolution. Sericultural workers aim for a guaranteed price of 1,250 yen, intending to maintain this forced price. In short, the activation of the guarantee law is now unavoidable.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 4th: Kagayama and Imai of the Central Sericultural Association met at the association's office on the morning of the 4th to discuss the items desired by those in the industry from the Silk Price Committee. As a result, the following items were decided and submitted to the Minister of Agriculture: (1) The guaranteed price is 1,250 yen per 100 catties. (2) The quantity is 250,000 catties of the 4th-year production. (3) Accept financing with silkworm cocoons or their designated stack certificates as collateral. (4) We hope that the bank will designate the related banks as usual. (5) In order to promote production adjustment, the government will supervise, and the guarantee law will not apply to products that violate it.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 4th: Regarding the sharp decline in silk prices, Minister of Agriculture Machida reported at today's cabinet meeting that in order to prevent a sharp decline in silk prices, silk industrialists have decided to jointly store 50,000 bundles of raw silk with public funds. However, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry believes that while promoting joint storage, it is also necessary to implement the Raw Silk Financing Guarantee Law. I deeply believe that the implementation of this law is unavoidable. Subsequently, it was decided to wait for the committee's response on three points: the implementation period, the guaranteed quantity, and the guaranteed amount per 100 catties of raw silk.</p>
<h3>Promoting Industrial Rationalization</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Hamaguchi Wants to Implement It at This Time</p>
<p>Gradually Seeking Fundamental Transformation of the Financial World</p>
<p>▲Japan United Press, Tokyo, 4th: The Japanese government, based on the explanation of Finance Minister Inoue, discussed measures to relieve the worsening situation in various markets at today's cabinet meeting. The government believes that the main causes of today's financial depression and the sharp drop in stocks are the fall in silver prices and other overseas situations, various opposing propaganda, and the instigation of political enemies. Therefore, it was decided to first stabilize silk prices and apply the emergency means of the guarantee law. A concrete plan will be decided at the Silk Price Committee to be held on the 5th. It is also planned to thoroughly crack down on those who attempt political conspiracies by taking advantage of the financial depression. Prime Minister Hamaguchi intends to do his best to implement industrial rationalization at this time in order to gradually seek the fundamental transformation of the financial world.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 4th: The government has decided to promote the rationalization of industrial administration to reduce taxes, repay national debts, and facilitate industrial facilities, finding sources of funds. Four items are the main focus: simplifying the general administrative system and organization to make it clear and simple, unifying industrial administration, and promoting industrial rationalization with the private sector as a model, giving the industrial sector a major stimulus, and aiming for the rationalization of government-run enterprises. The contents are generally: automobiles are managed by both the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Railways, electricity is managed by both the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways, and religion is managed by both the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Interior. The unification of mixed administrative affairs, trade, tariffs, and commerce are handled jointly by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Airplanes are related to the Army, Navy, and Ministry of Communications, and airplane factories are linked to the Army and Navy factories, resolutely implementing the most economical methods of operation.</p>
<h3>Major Flooding in Southern France</h3>
<p>Unseen in a Century</p>
<p>Disaster Victims Climb onto Roofs for Help</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Paris, 3rd: Major flooding unseen in a century has occurred in southern France. The disaster is severe in many villages and towns, especially in Montauban. Last night, the banks of the Tarn River there burst, and residents, hearing the sound of water, got up and fled in alarm. Most escaped, but some were unable to escape and drowned. Many houses were washed away, and some disaster relief boats are missing. There are also disaster reports from other places.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Toulouse, France, 4th: The flood continues to spread and is extremely dangerous. To date, 20 people have died. Refugees in the disaster area are climbing onto rooftops, calling for help, but it is impossible to rescue them all. ▲National News Agency, Paris, 3rd: The flood in southern France is quite widespread. Local officials have requested the assistance of the military authorities in flood prevention and disaster relief. The property losses are quite large, but there are few casualties. Railway services are blocked by water in many places.</p>
<h3>Naval Conference Situation Slightly Improves</h3>
<p>Considerable Understanding Between the US and Japan</p>
<p>French Plenipotentiary to Arrive in London Shortly</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, London, 3rd: It is widely rumored at the Naval Conference that the United States and Japan have reached an understanding. Japan has accepted the proposal of 60% for auxiliary cruisers, excluding 6-inch gun cruisers. The United States has agreed to build only 15 cruisers before 1936, instead of the originally proposed 18. Therefore, the main point of contention between the two sides is only the total tonnage. The United States has permitted Japan to have 60,000 tons, while Japan still maintains its original proposal of 78,000 tons.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, London, 4th: The specialized committee of the Disarmament Conference met at St. James's Palace at 11 a.m. on the morning of the 3rd, discussing for two hours. As a result, a report was decided and reported to the First Committee. The decisions were: (1) method of limitation, (2) non-limited vessels, (3) special vessels. However, regarding item 8 of the non-combatant ship limitation items agreed upon at the Geneva Conference for non-limited vessels, that is, those with aircraft launching devices on board and those carrying three or more aircraft in a launch-ready state, and special vessels are limited to target ships, mine-laying ships, training ships, seaplane tenders, etc. Although Japan's five training ships have been recognized, when building replacement ships, their firepower must be added to the tonnage limit of the ship types specified in the limitation method. Also, gunboats and others are incorporated into the non-limited vessels. The restrictions related to submarines will be discussed after France participates.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, London, 3rd: After entering the seventh week, the focus of the London Disarmament Conference has largely shifted to informal negotiations between Japan and the United States. The fourth meeting between plenipotentiaries Matsudaira and Riddell was held on the afternoon of the 3rd. Because both Japan and the United States have received instructions from their governments, considerable progress is expected.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Paris, 3rd: The new cabinet of French Prime Minister Tardieu, which was feared to be unsustainable, has gradually stabilized with the support of various parties in the Chamber of Deputies. The plenipotentiary delegation attending the Disarmament Conference is scheduled to depart from Paris for London on the 6th. However, Tardieu will not go for the time being. Foreign Minister Briand will serve as the de facto chief plenipotentiary, attending the conference and negotiating with the plenipotentiaries. ▲Reuters, Washington, 3rd: Senator McKellar (Democrat) moved to recall the US delegation to the London Naval Conference. Senators Swanson and George (both Democrats) opposed the motion, saying that the US delegation would do its best to reduce the same figures and would not be discouraged by difficulties.</p>
<h3>Monarchists Attempt to Preserve the Throne</h3>
<p>Will Restore Dictatorship</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Madrid, 3rd: Political circles predict that Prime Minister Berenguer will soon restore the dictatorship. This move may be presided over by Infante Alfonso, or it may not be known. Recently, the revolutionary movement has gained momentum, and the monarchists have become more united and vowed to do their best to preserve the throne and seek assistance from the military. However, the attitude of a large part of the army is now questionable, especially the defense forces in major cities. Infante Alfonso met with the Spanish king for a long time on Sunday, and rumors have it that they were studying whether the dictatorship could be restored.</p>
<h3>Indian New Budget Proposal</h3>
<p>Opposition Parties Prepare to Attack</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New Delhi, 3rd: Opposition party members of the Indian Legislative Assembly met today to discuss the strategy for attacking the new budget proposal in parliament tomorrow. It is said that opinions among the participants varied. The National Congress Party strongly opposed the method of recognizing imperial preferential treatment, saying that this method contradicted the policy of the All India National Congress, which aims to boycott British goods. The National Congress Party demanded that the cotton cloth tax should be assessed and levied at 20% uniformly. Representatives of the Bombay Cotton Mill Industry said that the Indian cotton industry should not be destroyed by political programs. The proposed additional half-percent tax on non-British goods is only a temporary measure and is not a policy of permanently recognizing imperial goods' preferential treatment.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 3rd: Representatives of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce and cotton cloth industry groups in the United Kingdom met with the Minister of Commerce today to discuss the Indian tax increase on cotton goods. They left after two hours. The Ministry of Commerce has not yet issued a statement on this conversation.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Osaka, 4th: The Osaka Chamber of Commerce resolved today to request the government to inform the British and Indian governments that the cotton goods tax levied by the Indian Parliament discriminated against Japanese goods and should be abolished.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 4th: The India-Japan Association telegraphed the Indian Legislative Assembly and influential Indian groups, requesting the cancellation of the cotton goods tax levied by the parliament, saying that this move violated the spirit of the India-Japan trade agreement. Japan is a major buyer of Indian products and does not levy taxes on Indian raw iron for fear of hurting the feelings of the Indian people. Now, the Indians are harming the Japanese cotton mills and benefiting British industries, which is not a good idea. This move is not beneficial to the Indian cotton mills.</p>
<h3>George Denies Resigning as Party Leader</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 3rd: Liberal Party leader George today firmly denied the rumor that he intends to resign as party leader. He said that Liberal Party Whip Hugh Glynne decided to resign because many party members did not listen to his guidance. On Thursday, many people did not vote in favor of the important proposals put forward by the party, resulting in failure. Therefore, he (George) is now trying to retain him. The Liberal Party met in the House of Commons today, and members who opposed George's party did not attend. It was decided on the spot to hold another meeting tomorrow. If the notification requesting the unity of the party members is still disregarded tomorrow, those who do not follow the party's decisions will no longer receive notifications in the future. Hugh Glynne has agreed not to resign temporarily, pending the outcome of tomorrow's meeting. Hugh Glynne also decided to propose at tomorrow's meeting that the Liberal Party should insist on opposing the Coal Mines Act.</p>
<h3>New Agreement Established Between Turkey and Greece</h3>
<p>▲National News Agency, Ankara (formerly Angora), 3rd: It is reported that the agreement reached between the Turkish and Greek sides to resolve the disputes arising from the Treaty of Lausanne was signed this afternoon by the Turkish Foreign Minister and the Greek Ambassador, each with the first letter of their names. The agreement includes the exchange of 1.5 million people and the financial compensation for this move. It also stipulates that all Greeks currently residing in Istanbul and Turks currently residing in the Cyclades Islands are allowed to reside there permanently. Property belonging to the aforementioned 1.5 million people that was previously confiscated must be returned immediately. There are still more than 100,000 Greeks who formerly resided in Istanbul whose property has been taken over by Turkey, which will be compensated by the Greek government. It is expected that once this agreement is completed, the commercial treaty and friendship treaty between the two countries can also be concluded. The Turkish government has invited the Greek Prime Minister to Ankara to sign the agreement, which the Greek Prime Minister has agreed to.</p>
<h3>Japan Decides on Budget Total</h3>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 4th: Today's cabinet meeting decided on the following imperial decree, which will be published in the official gazette on the 5th: In accordance with Article 71 of the Constitution, the previous year's budget will be implemented for the fifth year of Showa.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 4th: The Investigation of the budget for the implementation of the fifth year of Showa is nearly completed by the Budget Bureau. The council will open to discuss the budget tomorrow. According to the budget bureau, the total amount of implemented budget is 1.565 billion yen, and the additional budget for the fifth year of Showa is 45 million yen. In total, the implemented budget for the fifth year is 1.61 billion yen. The budget of the rejected council budget is increased by about 8 million yen. However, the obligation of compulsory teaching expenses, the burden of the national treasury increase and other additional budgets were not included in the rejected budget.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Fiji's Request for Independence</h3>
<p>Lists Fourteen Items</p>
<p>▲World News Agency, Manila: The first Fiji Independence Conference has passed the Fiji Declaration of Independence, listing fourteen reasons for Fiji to request complete and absolute independence from the United States, which will be notified to the US President, the US Congress, and the world. The fourteen reasons are as follows: (1) Fiji's independence is the application of the Jones Act; (2) Fiji is better governed by Fijians than by Americans; (3) Fiji is an independent Asian country that once had a republican government, but was merged by foreign countries as a result of war, so it wants to restore its former independence; (4) Fijians believe that they are more politically and economically complete than some independent countries today; (5) The best preparation for independence is independence itself; (6) Fiji's long affiliation with the United States is an economic loss to the United States; (7) The politics of the Fiji Governor, due to the change of Governors and changes in policies, leave Fijians at a loss as to what to do; (8) Fijians and their leaders do not pay attention to other important national affairs unless they obtain independence themselves; (9) There are criticisms in the United States and elsewhere that Fijians have no capacity for independence, which are deliberately distorted truths by imperialists; (10) Fiji's free trade relationship is threatened by the unfair and unequal economic laws of the United States; (11) Differences in race, history, and culture make it difficult for Americans and Fijians to stand under the same flag and maintain a satisfactory relationship; (12) Fiji's independence, in accordance with American history and tradition, is the only reasonable policy that should be pursued; (13) Allowing Fiji to be independent means that the democratic and republican ideas inherited from the United States are gradually spreading to the East; (14) Prolonged control over Fiji is conducive to the creation of disbelief and hatred.</p>

<p>International Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>Sharp Drop in London Stock Prices</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 3rd: Stock market prices have fallen sharply for various reasons, one of which is the pessimism of the public about the future budget proposals. The market has been trending downward gradually for half a month, especially yesterday. Within a few hours, the value of stocks of three well-known companies fell by three million pounds. Gramophone securities were very popular a few months ago, worth 40 million pounds, but today they are only worth 12 million pounds. Newspaper financial reporters said that this situation was not caused by financial urgency, but because investors are unwilling to try even the most reliable industrial securities. The Shell Transport Company issued 5 million pounds of preferred stock, but only 18% has been subscribed, which can be taken as proof.</p>
<h3>International Securities Unification Conference</h3>

<h3>Public Telegrams</h3>
<p>Telegram from the Special Party Department of the Jinpu Railway to All Newspaper Offices for Consideration: The remnants of the warlord Yan Xishan, entrenched in Shanxi and Hebei, dominate their regions and act like hegemons. They are cunning by nature. Initially, they took advantage of the Xinhai Revolution to establish a base in Shanxi, and then they became powerful through compromise. After eighteen years, when our army launched the Northern Expedition, they seized the opportune moment and falsely claimed to join the revolution. However, during the reorganization, they secretly obstructed the process, and they expanded their territory every day. Furthermore, they specialized in instigating others to betray the central government, hoping to gain from the chaos. Previously, when Feng Yuxiang's forces started trouble, they declared their intention to suppress them but ultimately did not send a single soldier. Subsequently, the mutiny of Shi Yousan's troops and the rebellion of Tang Shengzhi were all orchestrated and directed by them in secret. They have used every means possible to undermine the central government. Now, they have joined forces with imperialist warlords, rebellious bandits, and various reactionary elements to openly rebel, brazenly deploying troops and invading Shandong and Henan. The Jinpu Railway, adhering to the central government's peaceful principles, has been making efforts to maintain transportation, opening trains to the north daily to benefit merchants and travelers. Unexpectedly, they have been detaining trains running on the Pingpu line and various passenger trains on the northern section for days, transporting troops, monitoring telegrams, and seizing control of railway affairs. They have dared to take the lead in committing outrageous acts and disrupting transportation. Disregarding the nation's difficulties, the merchants' plight, and the railway's hardships, they only seek to oppress the people and indulge their ambitions. Not only have they never escaped from the warlord feudal ideology and disregarded the central government, but they have also undermined the party and national principles, falsely accused the Premier, and stolen the fruits of the revolution. We believe that the failure of the revolution lies solely in eliminating these remnants. We request that all levels of party departments across the country strictly enforce party discipline and implement sanctions uniformly. We also request that the central government launch a large-scale campaign to suppress them, and that the people of the whole country unite to denounce them. We swiftly expect to quell the chaos in Shanxi and Hebei, stabilize the party and the country, and unite in shared hatred. This telegram is sent to inform and seek your advice. Respectfully, the Executive Committee of the Special Party Department of the Jinpu Railway.</p>
<p>Telegram from Changsha to All Newspaper Offices for the Information of Distinguished Gentlemen: I received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang stating that my name was included in Yan's circular telegram. I have devoted myself to the party and the country and have only upheld the central government, consolidated unity, achieved genuine peace, and completed the revolutionary task. This heart and this will have remained unchanged. I was not consulted for this circular telegram. This is a special declaration for your consideration. Respectfully, He Jian.</p>
<p>Telegram from Hankou to All Newspaper Offices for Consideration: Recently, I sent a telegram to Mr. Yan Xishan, which read, "Urgent, Immediate Attention Required." Honorable Deputy Commander Yan of Taiyuan, I have respectfully read your circular telegram. You advocate a general vote of all party members to resolve internal party disputes. As long as the decision is made by the majority, whether it is a continuation of the Third Central Executive Committee, a restoration of the Second Central Executive Committee, or the creation of a Fourth Central Executive Committee, it is all acceptable. If this method can be implemented, it would not be difficult to place the party and the country on a solid foundation. After reading it, I am greatly perplexed. Since the reorganization of our party in 1924, the Central Executive Committee members and Central Supervisory Committee members have been re-elected annually according to the law. Therefore, when the Second Central Executive Committee was established, it was the day when the term of the First Central Executive Committee expired, and the day when the tasks of the First Central Executive Committee ended was also the day when the qualifications of the Central Executive Committee members and Central Supervisory Committee members were terminated. From then on, this has been the principle for all changes. This meaning is very clear and does not need detailed explanation. However, after the expiration of the Second Central Executive Committee, the central authority has the freedom to allow the Third Central Executive Committee to exercise the restoration of power, which is a direct violation of the regulation that the Central Committee members are re-elected annually. It enables those who are legal to be unable to exercise their powers, while those who have no power can control the party. Its destruction of the law and disruption of discipline is very obvious. According to the provisions of the Party Constitution, the Central Executive Committee members and Central Supervisory Committee members are elected by the National Congress. The Third Central Executive Committee was produced according to law. Except for the Reorganization Faction, the Xishan Conference Faction, and all reactionary elements, all party members sincerely support the Central Committee and have no doubts about it. Since its establishment, it has exercised its powers, and the whole country relies on it. Since the authority has not been interrupted, why is there a need to continue it? The so-called continuation is nothing more than turning the situation upside down, destroying the existing situation, in order to achieve personal, selfish, and self-serving conspiracies. Their betrayal of the Central Committee is obvious. Now, if you want to deny the Central Committee elected by the National Congress representing all party members, and instead use a general vote of all party members to determine the Central Committee, how will you distinguish between this so-called "all" and that so-called "all"? What method do you have to gather party members from all over the country in one place to hold a vote? Otherwise, if the name of all party members is stolen by a small number of troublemakers, and the will of all party members is hijacked by one or two powerful people, then the so-called internal party disputes will never be resolved. Since you have taken the resolution of internal party disputes as your own responsibility, you must have a deep understanding of the history of the party and a thorough study of the party's principles and constitution before you can talk about the party. If you still do not know that there is a party in your heart, and you are making such seemingly right but actually wrong arguments, your betrayal of the central government and violation of party discipline has been seen by the world. If you want to save the party, you must lead by example and obey the discipline of the party. In terms of party discipline, if party members have opinions, they should be published in the district branch according to law and make suggestions to the central government in an orderly manner. They cannot issue circular telegrams in their individual names, let alone collude with traitors, borrow names, and arbitrarily advocate. If party discipline is ruined, the party will be shattered. As your telegram said, "If there is no whole party, there is no unified country." Then, where is the principle of the party and the country that is not at all different? As the saying goes, "There is nothing in the world, but fools trouble themselves." If you have other intentions, you don't have to talk about revolution and pretend to save the party, secretly practicing the act of instigating chaos. The lessons of Feng Yuxiang and other traitors should be taken as a warning. Be careful! This telegram is sent to inform you. I hope you will publish it in detail. Respectfully, He Jian, Lu Diping, Liu Xiang, He Chengjun, Wang Jinyu, Xu Yuanquan, Xia Douyin, Jiang Dingwen, Yang Hucheng, Fan Shisheng, Guo Rutao, Li Yunheng, Luo Lin, Shangguan Yunxiang, Hao Mengling, Zhang Huizan, Chen Cheng, Liu Jianxu, Zhao Guantao, Liu Chunrong, Liu Guitang, Xiao Zhichu, Gong Bingshen, Li Yunlong, Yue Weijun, Peng Qibiao, Li Huaibing, Ma Dengying, Deng Yancun, Peng Jinzhi, Wan Yaohuang, together bow and pay our respects.</p>

<p>▲Resolution on Restricting Concurrent Positions of Officials</p>
<p>To improve politics, officials must have specific responsibilities and positions must have specific duties so that efficiency can be improved and integrity can be cultivated. Since the Party established its capital in Nanjing, the National Government has repeatedly promulgated clear orders that political officials shall not receive concurrent salaries and administrative officials shall not hold concurrent positions. This has had a considerable effect on cultivating integrity, but it has not yet been fully implemented in terms of improving efficiency. The 16th Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee has again resolved that party and government organs should strictly define the restrictions on concurrent positions, but the restrictions on concurrent positions of officials have not yet been determined due to various obstacles. As a result, the efficiency of politics cannot be improved, and the stagnation of careers and the disorganization of officials will inevitably follow. Now, in order to actively encourage efficiency and promote achievements, the restrictions on concurrent positions of officials are determined as follows: (1) In order to achieve the unity of national will and the continuity of administrative guidelines, political officials may hold concurrent positions, but they shall not violate items two, three, and four. (2) Central officials shall not concurrently serve as local officials. (3) Officials of various Yuan, ministries, and committees shall not concurrently serve as officials of other Yuan, ministries, and committees. (4) Officials of various provinces and cities shall not concurrently serve as officials of other provinces and cities. (5) Administrative officials shall absolutely not hold concurrent positions.</p>

<h3>Jinpu Railway Traffic Interrupted</h3>
<p>Report from Jinan: Since yesterday (28th), Tianjin has been detaining Jinpu trains. Yesterday, train No. 201 on the Pingpu line did not come south. When the Jinpu Railway Bureau received this news, it stopped the Jinpu train No. 2, which should have been going north, in Jinan. Yesterday, it was changed to train No. 1 and still went south. In the evening, train No. 202 on the Pingpu line also arrived in Jinan and decided to change it to train No. 201 and return to Pukou, no longer going north. It is reported that today (2nd), the Jinpu train No. 1 was also detained in Tianjin and could not come south. Thus, north-south traffic was interrupted. Since yesterday, the postal bureau has changed the route for mail going north. All mail within Shandong Province has been changed to land routes. Mail to Pingpu and the three northeastern provinces has been changed to the Jiaoji Railway to Qingdao, and then transmitted by sea. The unified No. 1 armored train went to Dezhou from Jinan in the afternoon yesterday to inspect the situation in the northern section. Chen Tiaoyuan has been paying close attention to the defense of the provincial capital recently. The remnants of Gao Guizi's troops in Zhucheng have been surrounded and disarmed by the Shandong army.

<h3>Wang and Yang's Telegram to Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>Report from Bengbu: The Third Army Headquarters here recently received a telegram sent by Wang Bingqian from Taiyuan to Army Commander and Commander of the 7th Division Wang Jun and Commander of the 10th Division Yang Shengzhi, with the intention of provoking discord. In addition to replying to the telegram separately, Wang and Yang telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and He Yingqin yesterday, saying: "Respectfully to Commander-in-Chief Chiang of Nanjing, Chief Supervisor He, and Chief of Staff Zhu: Recently, we received a telegram sent by Wang Bingqian from Taiyuan, which read: 'The country is in urgent need. To Commanders Wang and Yang, and Brother Guo Xiang: We are secretly, swiftly, and pleasurably discussing matters in Zhengzhou. After returning to Shanxi, all progress is underway and has now been announced via telegram. To achieve satisfactory results, we hope that all parties will make concerted efforts. If you have any opinions on national affairs or military matters that are inconvenient to telegraph to Mr. Yan or Mr. Feng, please let us know and we will forward them on your behalf. Please send replies to the General Staff Department of the Taiyuan Headquarters, to Wang Bingqian.' We have verified that Wang Bingqian is a native of Guizhou, whom we have never known before. We also did not meet with him in Zhengzhou. Commander Yang Shengzhi is only from the same province, and there is no prior acquaintance. Now, Wang Bingqian is sending a secret book on the one hand and sending this telegram on the other, creating confusion with false pretenses and using ghostly tricks. Commanders Jun and Zhi support Commander-in-Chief Chiang and are determined to be loyal. These provocative rumors are of no consequence to us. However, we are concerned that Wang Bingqian may change or intensify his efforts and falsely claim credit for himself. Therefore, we have sent separate replies using clear text. One of them read: 'We have received your telegram. The 10th Division and the 7th Division support the central government and will never waver. Why are you trying to provoke discord? Yan and Feng's absurd actions are cutting themselves off from the party and the country. Since they are so obsessed, we can only follow the central government's instructions and complete unification. You are using a scheme to separate us, and your efforts will be in vain, so we do not approve of it.' Yang Shengzhi, Dongyin. The other read: 'We received your telegram and find it absurd. Commander Jun does not know who you are, yet you presumptuously sent a telegram, creating confusion with false pretenses and trying to provoke discord. Your false heart is clumsy and of no use. Commander Jun has been following Premier Sun Yat-sen and Commander-in-Chief Chiang for more than ten years, and only knows to support the central government and love the party and the country. Everyone in the country considers those who undermine unity and betray the central government as enemies. We hope that you will convey to Yan and Feng to practice what they have said and go abroad as soon as possible to atone for their sins and avoid misleading the country and harming the people.' Wang Jun, etc., respectfully telegraphed this report and requested instructions. Commanders Wang Jun and Yang Shengzhi, Kou Dong Youyin."</p>
<h3>Bloody Battle in Beiliu, Guangxi Province</h3>
<p>▲No Traces of Zhang's Army in Southern Guangdong Province</p>
<p>Report from Guangzhou: In the battle in Guangxi Province, both sides fought a bloody battle in Beiliu for two days and nights, with no less than 4,000 casualties, which is the largest sacrifice in the war in Guangxi Province in more than ten years. Beiliu is located 50 miles north of Yulin, and further up is Rong County. Rong County is located north of Cenxi and Wuzhou. Going east from Beiliu, one can also enter Gaozhou on the border of Guangdong. Its terrain is the barrier of Wuzhou and Gaozhou. The Eighth Route Army then determined that this place was a dangerous point on the left wing and must be captured in order to control Zhang's army's route from Gaozhou invading Luoding and out of the West River. Therefore, it was decided to capture Beiliu with elite troops, and then attack Guixian. Its vanguard, the two divisions of Jiang Guangnai and Xiang Hanping, began the attack on the morning of the 14th. The two brigades of Xu Zongwu and Feng Kelu guarded Beiliu. After the firing began, the artillery fire was dense and uninterrupted. The Guizhou army could not hold on, and Li Zongren transferred two brigades of Wu Chaodong and Liang Chaoqi from Guixian to join the battle. Finally, Zhang Fakui's army also transferred a certain regiment that had entered Xinyi to participate. The Eighth Route Army then transferred Cai Tingkai from the rear to reinforce. The two sides used the strength of three or four divisions to fight fiercely for another day and night. At this time, corpses were piled up and blood flowed into ditches. The Eighth Route Army had aircraft teams in the air to provide cover, and the line was strong. It was not until noon on the 16th that Zhang and Gui's army collapsed and fled to Guixian Luchuan. According to official news, more than 2,000 soldiers of Zhang's army died in this battle, and more than 1,000 soldiers of Gui's army. Chen Mingshu also admitted to people that the front-line infantry lost more than 1,000 people. In total, the actual number of deaths on both sides was more than 4,000. Since this battle, both sides have entered a state of truce due to the heavy sacrifices. Jiang's division of the Eighth Route Army is still holding Beiliu. Xiang's division is resting in Rong County. Cai's division was transferred back to Cenxi. The Gui army is receiving troops in Guixian. Zhang's army is concentrated in Luchuan Bobai. The troops that had invaded Gaozhou Xinyi before have also retreated to the border of Guangxi. There are no traces of Zhang's army in Xinyi. The Eighth Route Army then ordered the Southern Route Army to pursue and suppress the bandits. The First Special Task Battalion, led by Xu Zhenhuan, recovered Shuidong on the 23rd in conjunction with the Gaozhou Dianbai Guard. At about 4 pm on the 24th, it recovered Maoming County (that is, Gaozhou Prefecture). Huang Zhihuai, the county magistrate appointed by Zhang's army, fled to Yunlu from the North Gate. A part of the people's army, led by Ye Dasen, still retreated to Huazhou. On the 25th, Xu's camp had joined forces with Huang Jianmin's troops to pursue and suppress the bandits in Huazhou. Huazhou will not be difficult to recover soon. (February 27th)</p>
<h3>The Fujian Situation Will Be Resolved Satisfactorily</h3>
<p>▲The Six Arrested People Will Be Sent to the Province from Yanping</p>
<p>Report from Fuzhou on the 1st: Zhang Qun came to Fujian this time to investigate the Fujian affairs. Unfortunately, a violent incident occurred in which a thug attacked Vice Officer Li. Li has passed away due to serious injuries. Although the provincial government and all sectors have done their best as hosts, Commander of the Provincial Defense Lin Zhong and Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Guo Yongyun have still resigned to take responsibility for inadequate protection. On the one hand, the captured murderer Ni Danqi was transferred to the Provincial Defense Headquarters for a final decision. Regarding the release of the six arrested people in the Fujian situation, when Zhang's entourage Guo Shihui, together with Lu's staff officer Yu Boliang and Chief Counselor Yang Yugu, went to Yanping, Lu had decided to properly send them to the province so that the authorities could submit a request for their dismissal and await investigation, in order to show respect for the central government's intentions. However, the provincial capital recently received news that Yang Shuzhuang ordered Liu Heding to send three regiments to the province to help with the defense. Various parties were quite concerned. Certain important people also feared misunderstandings and requested Yang to telegraph to stop them. Yang approved of this proposal, so Zhang Qun and Chen Jiliang jointly telegraphed the central government, requesting that Liu's troops be postponed from entering the province. Due to this problem, the sending of the six arrested people to the province has been delayed. Zhang originally planned to take the Pu'an to Shanghai on the 27th. Later, in order to complete the result, he temporarily delayed it for another day. So that evening, he sent Guo Shihui to the province to make a final consultation with various parties. The opinions have become more harmonious. Yu Boliang telegraphed to Yanping, requesting that the three people detained in Youxi, Lin Zhiyuan, Chen Naiyuan, and Zheng Baoqing, be sent to Yanping first, and then together with Cheng Shijie, Xu Xianshi, and Wu Shu, who are in Yanping, be sent to the province together. It is expected that they will arrive in the province in two or three days, because it takes two days from Youxi to Yanping. On the morning of the 28th, Zhang Qun took the Pu'an warship back to the capital to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, leaving Guo Shihui in Fujian to make contact. On the one hand, he published a farewell notice in various newspapers, saying that the truth of all parties has been clarified and the contacts have been initiated, and he is eager to report to the central government for verification. On the same day, in the afternoon, it was heard that Liu's division had been postponed from being transferred to the province, but it was not certain that the six people would be dismissed and investigated. As for the reorganization of the provincial government, it will be decided after Zhang Qun reports to the capital.</p>
<h3>Post of Qingdao Mayor Changed: Defense Concerns</h3>
<p>Qingdao Communication: Qingdao Mayor Ma Fuxiang has been transferred to the position of Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government. His vacated post will be succeeded by Ge Jingen. It is reported that Ge Jingen is scheduled to depart from Beijing on March 5th to come to Qingdao and is expected to arrive in Qingdao on the 8th to take over. Ma Fuxiang has already telegraphed Sun Shengwu, the acting secretary-general of the municipal government, to prepare for the handover. Ge has already dispatched a representative, Cheng, to Qingdao on the 1st to make preliminary arrangements. As for Ma Fuxiang's post as Chairman of Anhui, he is still strongly declining. His telegram to friends in Qingdao also expresses his unwillingness to take the position.</p>
<p>After the change of mayor, the defense issue of Qingdao is of utmost importance. When Ma Fuxiang came to Qingdao, Ma Hongkui dispatched a mixed brigade, led by Deputy Brigade Commander Tian Shaoqiu, to be stationed in Qingdao under Ma Fuxiang's command. Now that the mayor has changed, and Ma Hongkui has also moved to Anhui, it is imperative that the troops stationed in Qingdao be taken away. In this case, Qingdao's defense will inevitably become empty. Furthermore, since the resolution of Gao Guizi's troops, the security of Qingdao is even more crucial. It is reported that after Mayor Ge arrives, the central government will dispatch a brigade of troops to be stationed in Qingdao to strengthen the city's defenses. However, various sectors fear that the central army will not arrive before Ma's army leaves, which may lead to negligence. Therefore, many intend to retain Ma's army temporarily and prevent its relocation. In addition, the labor strikes in the four match factories in North China, Shandong, and Ludong Minghua have been mediated by the municipal party department and have all resumed work on February 28th. The labor movement in Qingdao has once again entered a period of stability. However, the Japanese yarn factory has stopped work twice, with approximately four hundred workers unemployed, and there is currently no solution for their resettlement. Sun Shengwu, the secretary-general of the municipal government, specifically summoned representatives of the workers yesterday for discussions and promised to find a solution and advised the workers not to take any unauthorized actions.

<p>Record of Interrogation of Former Jiangsu Provincial Executive Committee Member Ni Bi and Others</p>
<p>Ni Bi, Ge Jianshi, Gu Ziyang, former executive committee members of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department, and Chen Baixin, Ge Shangde, Gu Shuyin, Wang Zhiren, and seven other staff members, were detained and sent to the High Court by order of the Civil Affairs Department for investigation due to suspicion of being reactionary. The court investigation was held at 2 PM yesterday. Presiding Judge Lin Dawen, Prosecutors Sun Xiheng and Jin Henian, and defense lawyers Lu Xiangru, Chen Liren, and Xu Bingcheng appeared in court. First, Ge Jianshi was interrogated. Judge Lin asked if he had read the indictment and what He Minhun meant by sending him a letter. (Answer) It was Chen Minhun who sent it to me, not He Minhun. The prosecutor misunderstood. Chen Minhun and I are comrades. He wrote to me on September 20th. The phrases "great work" and "joint efforts" in the letter are procedures that party members should follow. The so-called great work is revolutionary work. (Question) Do you often associate with Teng Gu on weekdays? (Answer) We are colleagues, there is no such thing as close association. (Question) Teng Gu and He Minhun are both suspected of being reactionary. They are both involved in the Jiangsu Action Committee, do you know that? (Answer) Yes. (Question) How long has Teng Gu been away from the Provincial Party Department? (Answer) More than a month. (Question) Didn't you pay attention to him? (Answer) No. (Question) Ge Shangde, who is he to you? (Answer) He is my brother. (Question) Do you know about the letter to Yao Chengwen? (Answer) Because Yao intended to attack a few people, I wrote a letter to persuade him. (Question) Chen Jianming has not reported yet, which seems to be a pseudonym. So, do you need to investigate whether this letter was written by him, and whether there is such a person as Chen Minhun? Next was Ni Bi. (Question) The indictment says you have a relationship with Teng Gu and He Minhun. (Answer) Teng Gu was sent by the Central Party Department. From the time of the Provincial Steering Committee to the Provincial Executive Committee, the Central Committee trusted him very much. Therefore, he was later appointed as a member of the Executive Committee. This is the first point. Last year, when I worked with him, he did not express any reactionary remarks. Therefore, my colleagues and I did not know that he was reactionary. Later, because of discord among colleagues, we resigned. If we were involved in reactionary activities, the Central Committee could have investigated it in advance and would not have retained us. His reactionary activities outside were very secret, so we didn't know. We support the Central Committee. As for Lu Yingshan, the secretary who left the Provincial Party Department in November of the 17th year of the Republic, he did have improper activities. I also advised him. I don't know if he joined the reorganization faction. Next was Gu Ziyang. (Question) You did not expose Teng Gu when he left the Provincial Party Department, you are suspected of shielding him. Committee Member Miao of Jiangsu Province reported that you are related to the reactionary case, do you know that? (Answer) I originally did not know Teng Gu. I only met him after being appointed by the Central Committee as a member of the Provincial Party Department. We only cooperated because of revolutionary work. As for saying that he is a member of the reorganization faction, I have not seen any indication of this in his behavior as a colleague. However, the reason why I am close to him in general people's discussions is because I jointly submitted a request to resign. This resignation was really due to the difficulty of the work and the unwillingness to continue doing it. Most people advocated resignation as a proper solution, so we jointly resigned. However, if I had known that he had reactionary behavior at that time, I would definitely not have cooperated. Moreover, Teng Gu's remarks on weekdays did not criticize the Central Committee. (Question) Do you know that Teng Gu is suspected of being reactionary? (Answer) Reactionary is based on participation in politics. (Question) Are you in the Organization Department? (Answer) Yes. (Question) The people appointed by the county party departments, are they sent by the Organization Department? (Answer) They are selected and recommended by the counties, and appointed by the province after a meeting and vote. However, the procedures are handled by the Organization Department. (Question) In the reactionary case in Liyang, according to the report of the Department of Civil Affairs, you sent someone to negotiate at the meeting (Answer) That's not true. Next was Wang Zhiren. (Question) Are you and Lu Yinshan from the same hometown and classmates? (Answer) Yes. (Question) What did you write to him about? (Answer) In May of the 17th year of the Republic, I was in Suqian, and he was the secretary in the Provincial Party Department. I wrote to him once because I heard that he had reactionary things, so I wrote to persuade him. He did not reply to me either. Then, Gu Shuyin, Chen Baixin, and Ge Shangde were interrogated. According to their confessions, the phrase "attack" in the letter is a common expression in revolutionary work and should not be immediately considered reactionary. Moreover, Wu Erchang, who is mentioned in the letter, is a loyal member of the province. Furthermore, knowing someone is one thing, and interacting with them is another. Those who know each other may not necessarily interact with each other. The indictment accuses the defendants of committing crimes based on the letter, but the defendants only know those who have never interacted with them, etc. After everyone finished speaking, Judge Lin reiterated to everyone that today is the investigation court. You can present any evidence that is beneficial to the defendants. Ni Bi immediately stated that the document from the Department of Civil Affairs is a copy and seems to be based on empty words and cannot be immediately regarded as evidence. Then, lawyer Lu Xiangru supplemented this meaning, saying that the copy is empty and does not specify anything, which seems to have little connection with the people in this case. This should be brought to the attention of the judge. Subsequently, lawyers Chen Liren and Xu Bingcheng rose and said one after another that the indictment is based on a letter, pointing out that the date in the letter was written by He Minhun, but the signatory is Chen Jianming. Why would He Minhun only write the date in the letter? Furthermore, it cannot prove whose handwriting it is. All of these cannot be used as evidence to convict this case. After speaking, Ni and others requested that their detention be stopped. Judge Lin instructed that this request is temporarily difficult to approve during the investigation of evidence. After the evidence is investigated, they will be interrogated again. After the instruction, Ge and others were returned to the third branch of the prison for detention.</p>
<h3>Request from the Banking Industry on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line</h3>
<p>▲ Regarding the Modification of Silver Dollar Transportation Methods</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Banking Industries along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line, previously, due to the expiration of the transportation contract between Datong Company and the railway bureau, the transportation of silver dollars by the industry along the line became difficult. Therefore, they telegraphed the Ministry of Railways to order the bureau to renew the contract with Datong, reduce transportation costs, and appropriately increase commissions, or form a silver dollar transportation organization jointly by the industry associations in various ports to avoid financial stagnation. Subsequently, they received a ministry approval stating that the transportation of silver dollars has been reviewed and approved by the ministry and adopted a public bidding method, and merchants were invited to undertake the task. The bidding was opened on February 14th. Now, the Joint Association, considering that the bidding date has passed and no one has bid, has sent another telegram, which reads:</p>
<p>"To Minister and Vice Minister of the Nanjing Ministry of Railways, upon receiving and acknowledging your telegram, we should wait quietly for the Ministry to resolve the issue. However, the Banking Industry along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line transports a huge amount of national currency and banknotes every day, which has always been transferred by Datong Company. Now that it has been announced that it will cease operations, and there is no reliable company to entrust the transportation to, the Banking Industry along the line feels very inconvenient. Although the Railway Bureau can transport on behalf, the temporary silver dollar transportation method requires sending escorts and taking delivery upon arrival. If there is danger, they will not be responsible. In this situation, the Banking Industry transports silver dollars and banknotes every day, constantly in fear, and can only feel relieved after arriving at the destination. How can such a method be a long-term solution? The prosperity or decline of commerce depends on the adjustment of finance. At this time of difficult transportation, the Banking Industry would rather risk significant danger for a small profit. Therefore, they are unwilling to take responsibility for the exchange of money entrusted by various industries. This not only relates to the operation of the Banking Industry but also greatly affects the prosperity or decline of commerce along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line. Due to the cessation of operations of Datong Company, our Association's members are facing great challenges in the circulation of finance, which is why we made the request by telegram. Now that we have received the telegram, if there is a reliable company undertaking the task, our members will have someone to entrust transportation to, what more could we ask for? However, the bidding period has passed, and we have heard that no one has bid. Procrastinating in this way will cause significant hidden losses to the future of commerce. After careful investigation of the reason why no one has bid, the bidding terms are not perfect, and the commission earned is not enough to maintain operations, so no one is interested. We have heard that the cessation of operations of Datong Company was also due to this reason. Previously, the contract between Datong Company and the Railway Bureau gave a commission of 28%, which was still a loss. Now, the highest commission given in the bidding terms is 15%. Compared, the difference is vast. If there is no residual profit to be made, who would be willing to take responsibility for undertaking the task? The reasoning is obvious and does not need to be elaborated. In this situation, if the bidding terms can be improved and the commission increased, if there is a slight profit to be made, then there will definitely be a flurry of activity. Therefore, we ask the Ministry to order the Railway Bureau to quickly revise the bidding terms. As for the freight charges, the railway treatment is quite unfair. The Central Bank can transport silver dollars for free, while the Bank of Communications of Jiangsu Province receives a half-price reduction. Other commercial banks and money houses are charged the full fare. Although the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications of Jiangsu Province are state-owned or province-owned, they should be given special preferential treatment. However, protecting merchants is also an obligation of the state. Although it cannot be on the same scale as the Central Bank, it should be treated the same as the Bank of Communications of Jiangsu Province. If the disparity is too great, the cost will be relevant, and there will be significant hidden losses, which is not in line with the state's great intention to care for merchants. Furthermore, the Railway Bureau's charges are higher than those of Datong Company. If this continues, merchants, in order to maintain their capital, will inevitably switch to sea transport, and the Railway's income will inevitably decrease as a result. This is tantamount to driving fish into the deep, and attracting birds to the forest, and it is too unfair, which is contrary to the late Premier's intention to care for the people's livelihood. Therefore, we ask the Ministry to improve the freight charges. At this time of year, when the spring season arrives and merchants are importing goods, the circulation of finance cannot be delayed. Our Association has seen this and cannot remain silent. Because of the previous telegram, we once again express our sincere feelings. We implore the Ministry to consider that commerce and finance are of great importance, to decisively dispose of our Association's request, to quickly order the Railway Bureau to reduce freight charges, improve the bidding terms, increase commissions, and properly recruit reliable credit companies to undertake the task, or to continue to allow Datong Company to continue operations to utilize their expertise. In this way, not only will the members of our Association benefit immensely, but merchants in various industries will also receive generous gifts. This urgent telegram awaits your decision, and we ask for a telegram in response."</p>
<h3>Rampant Banditry in Various Chaozhou and Haifeng Counties</h3>
<p>Shantou correspondence: After the communist bandits on the border of Jiangxi and Guangdong were suppressed by the Eighth Brigade in Datian, Pingyuan, the communist bandits in Jiulongzhang, Shanzhang, and Tongguzhang in Fengshun felt isolated. Therefore, they gathered more than a thousand of their remnants and harassed Shuangtou, Xialong, Shishi, Jileigongping, and Huliping in Wuhua, intending to attack Wuhua and Xingning with all their strength and flee to the border of Jiangxi. Wei, the magistrate of Wuhua, immediately gathered the security teams of the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts to block them at Ping Shang, and telegraphed Meixian to request assistance from Mao Weishou of the Eighth Brigade. Brigade Commander Mao then dispatched the battalion of Liao Qirong stationed in Yekeng to advance in two routes, one from Sankeng and the other from Guizhu, to attack Longshi Ji. From 10:00 AM on the 18th to 3:00 PM, the bandits were in a poor position and retreated to the crossroads. The battle lasted until dusk, and Battalion Commander Liao retreated to Longshi Ji for the night. On the 19th, they attacked Leigongping and Huliping and burned down the bandit dens. The bandits were defeated and retreated to Guiren Village, then back to their old den in Jiulongzhang. That area is on the border of Meixian and Fengshun.</p>
<p>Liu Dasan, an important bandit in Fengshun, recently sneaked into Pan Tianshe Xia, plotting wrongdoing. He gathered more than 30 bandits, with more than 30 long and short guns. The Pan Tian security team rushed to encircle and suppress them. After a two-hour battle, Liu was captured alive and his head was displayed to the public.</p>
<p>Yunluo and Kuitan in Huilai County were harassed by local communists. Master Dai sent Ma Yang's battalion to quell the unrest. Battalion Ma was stationed in Kuitan and attacked the bandit den in Longtankeng on the 23rd, capturing three bandits and numerous flags, seals, and propaganda materials.</p>
<p>According to the confession of a bandit to the Jieyang County Office, Chang Ji Ji in Beitouxu was a communist party organization.

<p>Wife Does Not Return Home, Sister-in-Law as Collateral Gao, a villager from Lingjia Village, Qingpu, is 31 years old and works as a carpenter. In the 13th year of the Republic, he married A Gui, the second daughter of Li Zhu from Zhutianjing, through a matchmaker. After the marriage, the relationship between the husband and wife was relatively harmonious. For six years now, they have not had any children. In October of last year, Gao went away for business. Several days later, he returned home and found his wife was not there. He asked the neighbors, and they told him that Li Zhu had taken her back to her mother's house. Gao immediately went to his in-law's house to take her back. His mother-in-law, Li Zhu, excused that the woman was staying at a relative's house. Gao waited for several days but still did not see his wife. He then took his sister-in-law (Li Zhu's youngest daughter who had not yet married) home as collateral. Three months have passed, and Li Zhu came to Gao's house and claimed that A Gui was hidden by her eldest son. She needed to take her youngest daughter back first, and then send his wife back. Gao believed that Li Zhu was hiding his daughter and refused to release her, intending to deceive him. Therefore, he reported to the village chief of the village, requesting assistance in resolving the matter.</p>

The prospect of food shortage for the people is about to cause panic. Yesterday, merchants from Chongming came to Wuxi to purchase 360 shi of food rice from the Xinchangyuan Rice Store and other stores and presented it to the county government for verification of their passports. Citizens Zhang Xingcun and Zhou Quqing requested restrictions to maintain food security and requested that the example of Changshu be followed to prohibit exports.

<p>The Kidnapping and Injury Case in Nanxing Township Twenty bandits suddenly came to the house of Zhou Fuqing, the deputy head of Nanxing Township, in the third district of Wuyi County, the night before. They were armed with pistols and box cannons, and broke in through the side door. In addition to destroying everything in the house, they looted property and killed a two-year-old girl and kidnapped a five-year-old boy named Zhou Boliang.

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Department of Agriculture Convenes Rural Improvement Organizations The rural improvement undertakings in Jiangsu Province have recently seen considerable development. In total, there are no fewer than twenty official offices and public and private organizations engaged in this, but they are all independent and lack overall coordination. Therefore, the Department of Agriculture has specifically convened a joint meeting of rural improvement organizations in Jiangsu Province to seek the unification of the wills of the various organizations and to discuss concrete plans for rural improvement undertakings and the progress plan for the 19th year.</p>
<p>Road Construction Through Conscripted Labor Actively Underway The county government has repeatedly convened meetings of district chiefs and others to prepare for the conscripted labor road construction case, and has organized a conscripted labor road construction coordination association to actively carry it out. Yesterday, it again instructed the district chiefs to select people familiar with road administration within the route to serve as overall section chiefs, branch chiefs, and subsection chiefs, in order to compile a roster of conscripted labor funds and road construction supervision matters. It also ordered all district chiefs to organize conscripted labor road construction coordination branch associations in accordance with regulations within five days and submit them for record, in order to facilitate the implementation of the Puji Ferry Consolidation Method. The Zhenyangyi Puji Ferry suspended operations this spring due to incidents, and manager Chen Xiufeng also resigned on his own initiative due to business, resulting in a delay until now, without a resolution. Yesterday, Wang Jinting, chairman of the Yangzhou Chamber of Commerce, specifically came to Zhenjiang for this matter and held a meeting with Lu Xiaobo, chairman of the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, and others in the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce to discuss a solution. It was decided that Wang Jinting, chairman of the Yangzhou Chamber of Commerce, would be the general manager of the ferry, and Chen Xiufeng would still be asked to serve as the manager to manage all affairs, and several consolidation methods were agreed upon. After the internal personnel of the ferry are consolidated, a date will be chosen to start sailing in order to facilitate travelers.</p>

<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Report on the Bandit Looting of Xincang: Yaqian Town, located three miles from Xincang Town in the eastern part of this county, was subjected to a major bandit looting last year. Subsequently, the provincial government dispatched a company of the provincial security force to be stationed in Xincang. Simultaneously, there were local security forces, water and land police, merchant militias, and county patrol teams, resulting in significant troop strength. At that time, wealthy households in Yaqian all moved to Xincang, and the bandits also fled. However, the situation has recently become tense again. Bandit leader Taibao Ashu has once again led a large gang of bandits, returning to their old lair at Liujia Yanqiao. In recent days, robberies have occurred in nearby small towns and villages. However, although Xincang is garrisoned with a large force, the issue of pay and provisions remains unresolved. The local population is unwilling to provide adequate supplies, leading to complaints from the provincial security force. On the 1st of this month, the team sent representatives to negotiate with Shen Shuangjie, the director of the Xincang Public Security Bureau, to borrow the owed wages. Shen repeatedly declined, firmly stating that he could not authorize it himself and had to consult with the county magistrate for a solution. After the representative reported back to the team, they were unwilling to remain stationed there and insisted on returning to their original defense area in Jiaxing. Consequently, Huang, the company commander, led two platoons of soldiers back to Pinghu to contact County Magistrate Fang. The remaining platoon remained stationed in the Xincang public lecture hall. Upon receiving the news, Pinghu immediately declared martial law, and the opera performances were halted. The local residents, hearing that the security force had retreated, knew that the eastern townships were in danger, leading to widespread panic. The security force platoon stationed in Xincang, about thirty or so men, continued to stand guard as usual on the night of the 1st. Unexpectedly, the bandit side learned that two platoons of the security force had departed, reducing the troop strength. At 3:00 AM on the morning of the 2nd, a large gang of bandits swarmed from Liujia Yanqiao with great fanfare, their electric lights illuminating the area and gunshots ringing out. They immediately killed six sentries on the spot and charged into Xincang, surrounding the entire town. The two sides formally opened fire. Ultimately, due to being outnumbered, the troops had to abandon Xincang. The bandits continued to press forward, forcing them to retreat to Siliqiao, near Guangchen Town. By daybreak, fortunately, the Shangban Anti-Smuggling Battalion stationed in Guangchen led a team to assist, launching a joint attack. The bandits began to retreat back to Xincang at around 8:00 or 9:00 AM. The number of soldiers killed in action is not yet clear. Shen Kai, the director of the Xincang Public Security Bureau, has returned to Pinghu to report. Patrol Chief Ye Zhenrong and four senior police officers have all been killed. Xincang is entirely in enemy hands, and the casualties among the people are even greater. County Magistrate Fang has telegraphed the provincial government to request reinforcements and is also raising funds and provisions, ordering the provincial security force that had come to Pinghu to return to Xincang. As Xincang has already fallen, they are temporarily stationed at Siliqiao to protect Guangchen before launching another attack. Currently, the telephone lines are cut, and news cannot be transmitted. The exact situation in Xincang is still unknown.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Two Robbery and Kidnapping Cases in Xiaozheng: Last night at dusk, more than ten bandits with painted faces and carrying firearms suddenly broke into the home of Zhu Guangcheng in Lujiazhai, Xiaozheng, ransacking and looting the place, causing losses of over two thousand taels of silver in rice, clothing, and ornaments.

<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>The Hengda Bank was Robbed: At 7:05 PM yesterday (the 2nd), four robbers suddenly appeared at the Hengda Bank on Tianhou Konghou Street in Ningbo. One stood guard outside, while three others, each carrying a handgun, broke into the interior, cut the telephone line, and drove the bank employees into the silver room. They then forced Chen Zisheng, the bank accountant, to take out the key and open the silver safe, stealing all the silver dollars and banknotes inside, totaling over a thousand yuan, as well as more than a dozen checks. They escaped with their loot. Afterward, the bank immediately telegraphed the Public Security Bureau, and they dispatched personnel to investigate, but so far, there have been no leads.</p>
<p>New Mayor to Take Office on Schedule: Yang Ziyi, the newly appointed Mayor of Ningbo, arrived in Ningbo from Shanghai the day before yesterday and immediately went to the city government to take over the seal of office.

<p>Department Store to Hold Variety Show: The Ningbo Commercial Consolidation Association, in order to repay accumulated debts, has borrowed the Dongmen Street Department Store to hold a variety show for many days. The association specifically sent Yan Su, the director of the variety show preparation committee, to Shanghai a few days ago to invite the Meihua Children's Song and Dance Troupe to perform in Ningbo for five days, from the 7th to the 11th of this month.</p>
<p>Li Brigade's Two Battalions Depart for Wenzhou to Suppress Bandits: Li Jie, the brigade commander of the 135th Brigade of the 45th Division of the National Army, stationed at the Tianning Temple and other places in Ningbo, received orders to supervise his two battalions of the 269th Regiment, along with soldiers and horses, and set off on the Yongning and Fuyu steamships at 1:00 PM yesterday to suppress bandits in Wenzhou.</p>

It is now reported that committee members are suspected of accepting bribes. The meeting resolved that work would be suspended pending a thorough investigation of the case. It will be resumed after the facts of the case are clarified.</p>
<p>Refugee Leaders Escorted Back to Shangyu: Wang Zhaolin, Wang Jinding, Wang Ganchu, Wang Yongqing, and Wang Xiaoshan, the leaders of the Hubei refugees, who were previously escorted to the Ningbo Local Court by the county government under police escort, were returned to the county by the court on the 1st, as the evidence was insufficient to accept the case. They are now under custody. The large number of refugees who were escorted out of the country have gone to the Fengbei region.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government to Redesignate Autonomous Regions: The autonomous regions of Xiaoshan County, previously divided into nine districts by County Magistrate Du and reported to the Provincial Civil Affairs Department for record, received a telegram from the department on the 1st of this month, stating that the county's district division had been instructed and recorded. However, after comparison with other counties of similar status, the difference is still too large. A request was made for a more appropriate redesignation by telegram.</p>
<p>Fundraising for the Construction of the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Platform: The Sun Yat-sen Memorial Platform at the Xiaoshan Public Sports Ground has now been completed. The construction cost is 1,400 yuan. In addition to the 300 yuan allocated from the county construction funds, there is still a shortfall of 1,100 yuan. The county government specifically convened a meeting of various agencies and organizations in Sun Yat-sen Park to discuss fundraising methods. It was resolved to assign various agencies and organizations to share the burden proportionally.</p>
<p>The Shaoshan Section of the Highway is Doing Excellent Business: The Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau currently manages the Hangzhou-Fuuyang, Gongshu-Sanqiao, Shaoshan, and Hangzhou-Changxing highway lines. Except for Hangzhou-Fuuyang, which has no potential for development, and Hangzhou-Changxing, which has only recently opened to traffic, the Shaoshan section is expected to generate an annual revenue of 468,000 yuan, and the Gongshu-Sanqiao section can generate 180,000 yuan annually. Without special circumstances, the two sections can generate a total of 648,000 yuan. After deducting expenses of approximately 300,000 yuan, there is still a net profit of over 300,000 yuan, which can be used to subsidize other roads. However, although the Shaoshan section has 50 locomotives, there is still insufficient capacity during the spring and winter seasons when there is a high volume of goods and passengers. It is still necessary to add more vehicles to maintain transportation. Therefore, the Shaoshan section has recently added three freight cars and two passenger cars, and it is estimated that future revenue will definitely increase.</p>
<p>Dredging the Qiantang River Will Soon Begin: Sand and gravel accumulate in the riverbed of the lower reaches of the Qiantang River.

The plan was approved by the provincial government meeting. The required funding, estimated at 145,000 yuan, will be allocated from the revenue of the Zhejiang Sand Field Bureau. The recruitment of workers and construction will begin soon.</p>
<h3>Dangtu</h3>
<p>Detailed Account of Bandits Looting Several Towns: Details of bandit leader Zhang Wende's harassment of Bowang Town have already been reported in the previous issue.

They then went to the Xinshi Town and robbed the Self-Defense Corps of several box cannons and quick-firing guns, killing two guards on duty. They then arrived at Bowang Town for harassment. The next morning, they crossed the river by boat and went to Xuzhong Village in Huyang, burning and looting. They were then repelled by the Public Security Team of Gaochun County. With no escape, the bandits returned to Xinshi territory by boat and anchored at Tangzhaiwei, threatening to riot. Upon hearing the news, the Bowang Town Self-Defense Corps sent platoon leaders Wang and Xu to lead their teams to pursue and suppress them, killing more than ten bandits, capturing two alive, and rescuing several captured corps members. Strict precautions are now in place, and merchants and residents are somewhat relieved.</p>

<h3>Methods for the Municipal Party Headquarters to Supervise the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>The methods for the supervision of the municipal government by the Special Municipal Party Headquarters in this city have been resolved by the Sixth Representative Assembly, and will be implemented as soon as they are approved by the Central Government. The methods and reasons are recorded as follows: (1) Methods 1. The municipal government (including all bureaus) should send the annual policy guidelines to the Municipal Party Headquarters (including the Executive and Supervisory Committees) one month before implementation for review. 2. The regulations and laws formulated by the municipal government, all of which must be submitted to the National Government for approval, or submitted to the municipal affairs meeting for review, should be sent to the Municipal Party Headquarters for review before or after submission. 3. At the beginning of each accounting year, the municipal government should send the compiled budget案 to the Municipal Party Headquarters for decision. 4. For financial matters related to the burden of the people, the municipal government should send them to the Municipal Party Headquarters for review before they can be forwarded or implemented. 5. If the Municipal Party Headquarters considers that the above items are not in line with the party's political program and policies after review, the Municipal Party Headquarters may attach its opinions and send them to the municipal government for amendment or abolition. 6. At the end of each accounting year, the municipal government should send the previous year's final accounts to the Municipal Party Headquarters for review and decision. 7. The municipal government should submit a report on its political achievements to the Municipal Party Headquarters for review at any time (at least once a year). 8. If the Municipal Party Headquarters finds that the municipal government's budget or political achievements violate the party's political program and policies, it may file an impeachment案 and report it to the Central Executive Committee, which will forward it to the National Government for investigation according to law. 9. If the municipal government fails to send the legal案s stipulated in items 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 above to the Municipal Party Headquarters on time, or handles them without waiting for the Municipal Party Headquarters to approve them, it will be regarded as despising the party's power, and the Municipal Party Headquarters should immediately raise questions, otherwise it will be regarded as dereliction of duty. 10. When the municipal government submits a request to the National Government to appoint or dismiss bureau chiefs, it should first obtain the consent of the Municipal Party Headquarters. 11. Unless there is a legitimate reason, the municipal government may not delay or shelve matters requested by the Municipal Party Headquarters. The Municipal Party Headquarters should also handle matters requested by the municipal government as soon as possible. 12. The Municipal Party Headquarters may send personnel to inspect the implementation of the municipal government's policies at any time. 13. These methods will be implemented after the Municipal Executive Committee reports them to the Central Government for record. (2) Reasons: It is heard that in the period of political tutelage, party power is important, and in the period of constitutional government, civil rights are important. In the period of political tutelage, party power replaces civil rights, then political power belongs to the party, and administrative power belongs to the government, that is, the party exercises its power and the government does its best, which is called party rule. The declaration of the First National Congress of the party regards the party as the central hub for controlling political power. The Central Party Headquarters has indeed implemented its party rule, but it has not been heard that local party headquarters have exercised civil rights on behalf of the people and implemented party rule. As a result of the malpractice, the power of the local party headquarters is reduced day by day, and the atmosphere of the local government is increasing day by day. If this continues for a long time, there will be many future troubles. Fortunately, the Central Government has promulgated the general rules for the supervisory committees at all levels to review the policy guidelines and political achievements of the governments at the same level, so the local party headquarters has a slight opportunity to supervise politics. However, its scope is only limited to policy guidelines and political achievements, and it still cannot fully supervise and exercise all civil rights. Based on these general rules and referring to the provisions on the powers of the municipal council in the municipal organization law, 13 methods for the Municipal Party Headquarters to supervise the municipal government in this city during the period of political tutelage are formulated, and it is requested that the conference discuss them in detail and formulate more perfect methods. On the one hand, report to the Central Government for record, and on the other hand, urge the next executive and supervisory committees to faithfully implement them, so that the future of party rule will be achieved.</p>

<h3>Czech Emigrants Prepare to Celebrate the 80th Birthday of the Czech President</h3>
<p>▲Masaryk, the Great Man Who Founded Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>Masaryk, the President of Czechoslovakia, is the founder of Czechoslovakia. The people of the country admire him very much. The 7th of this month is Masaryk's 80th birthday, and the whole country will hold a grand celebration to repay his merits and admire his virtues. The Czech emigrants in this city will also extend their congratulations. According to Masaryk's long-cherished wish to restore the country, after Austria-Hungary joined the war in 1914, he thought that the time had come, abandoned his family and left Prague alone, running around, advocating the Czech national revolution, and calling on comrades to form a large army, following the Allied forces to fight against Germany and Austria. When the European war was about to end</p>
<p>Czech President Masaryk</p>
<p>, the Czech army had 180,000 people, and the foundation of the country was established here. In 1917, after the Allies recognized the Czech national right to self-determination, Masaryk went to Russia, hoping to obtain the recognition of the Russian government. It happened that the Russian revolution broke out, and Masaryk knew that Russia was not reliable. Therefore, he took the road from Vladivostok to Canada in the following year and entered the United States, working tirelessly for independence. Then the founding of Czechoslovakia was completed. The people of the country remembered Masaryk's hard work for the country and welcomed him to the United States to serve as president. Masaryk governed the country for ten years, and everything was based on democracy. Therefore, the people of the country respected him, no less than Washington to the United States. Masaryk is a politician, but he is diligent in learning and especially profound in philosophy. His wife is Ms. Garrigue from the United States, who is known as a virtuous helper. Masaryk fled abroad for four years. When he returned after his success, he reunited with his wife. Not long after, his wife died of illness. Masaryk still sighs when he speaks of this.</p>
<h3>News of Sino-Japanese Tariff Negotiations Reported by the Japanese Side</h3>
<p>▲Three-Year Mutual Tariff Rate</p>
<p>The World News Agency said that according to the Dongbao, except for a very small part concerning mutual tariff rates, the opinions of both China and Japan on Sino-Japanese tariff negotiations have reached agreement. The scope of items concerning mutual tariff rates is also smaller than that requested at the tariff conference. The implementation period has also been changed from ten years to five years, and the Chinese side has requested to shorten the period. The final result will be set at about three years. The parts to be discussed in the future are only these points, and there is no difficulty in the negotiations. Once the final regulations are completed, they will be signed.</p>
<h3>Tax to Be Levied on Raw Silver Imports</h3>
<p>According to the Kwowen News Agency, due to the previous surge in gold prices and the sharp decline in silver prices, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry once considered banning the import of silver. However, due to various reasons, this ban has not been officially announced to this day. Recently, gold prices have risen again, while silver prices have not improved. The reason is that India has recently issued a ban requiring a special heavy tax on raw silver imports. As a result, raw silver from various regions is being redirected to China, making it even more difficult for silver prices to recover. Recently, many organizations and financial institutions have suggested to the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Commerce, and the Ministry of Finance that, before the ban on raw silver imports is issued, a temporary solution should be adopted, imposing a special heavy tax on all imported foreign silver to create a passive restriction. It is said that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry also have this intention and may implement it, possibly by specifying it in the new tariff regulations.</p>
<h3>Batch of American Silver to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ Over 1.31 Million Ounces</p>

<h3>Organization of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Completed</h3>
<p>▲ Director-General Concurrently Held by Director Liu Shufan</p>
<p>According to the New Shanghai News Agency, the Ministry of Transportation, in order to imitate the established practices of various countries, has established the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to expand savings and remittance services. The bureau is about to open and has been fully organized, divided into five departments. All key personnel have been appointed by the Ministry. Details are as follows: Director-General: Liu Shufan (concurrently); Deputy Director-Generals: Shen Shuyu, Mai Dunjian; Director of the General Affairs Department: Liang Hejun; Deputy Director: Chen Shizhen; Director of the Business Department: Ren Sida; Deputy Director: Wu Zengyu; Director of the Accounting Department: Liu Naihan; Deputy Directors: Chen Nengguang, Sun Ruihuang; Director of the Savings Department: Qian Chunqi; Deputy Director: Hua Xibo; Director of the Remittance Department: Cheng Zhenji; Deputy Director: Fang Gensheng; Chief Secretary: Chen Jixun.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers' Union Ceases Opposition to the Savings and Remittance Bureau Movement</h3>
<p>▲ Respecting the Party Headquarters' Intentions</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation's establishment of a separate Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has aroused concerns and attention among postal workers. At the time, both senior officials and junior staff expressed dissatisfaction. Subsequently, the Ministry of Transportation provided a detailed response explaining the reasons for the establishment, and the Directorate General of Posts also sent a letter to the Municipal Party Headquarters, requesting that it correct the actions of the labor union. The Municipal Party Headquarters immediately provided detailed instructions to the labor union, dispatched personnel to provide guidance, explained the purpose of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and emphasized that during these difficult times, such actions should be stopped to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world. However, the Municipal Party Headquarters fully understood that the labor union members and senior officials took these actions out of enthusiasm for protecting the postal service. The labor union, respecting the intentions of the Party Headquarters, will hold a joint meeting of supervisors and liaison officers today, and it is said that they plan to dissolve the action committee and cease this movement.</p>
<h3>City Center Construction Committee Requests Increased Funding</h3>

<h3>Update on Concessions Telephone Issue Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Chairman of the Chinese-Foreign Telephone Company Changes</p>
<p>Regarding the improvement of the concession telephone system, the advisory committee organized by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council have decided on the principles of improvement, which have been submitted to the Chinese-Foreign Telephone Company. The company is currently awaiting revisions to the acquisition terms from the three bidders before making a final decision. The date for the completion and preparation of the revised bid documents by the three bidders and the commencement of negotiations with the telephone company regarding the acquisition has not yet been determined. However, on February 28th, the telephone company convened a board meeting and elected legal representative Leber as the new chairman to facilitate communication with the three bidders. The advisory committee organized by the two municipal councils has essentially dissolved after submitting the agreed-upon improvement principles to the telephone company. In the future, the improvement issue will largely be handled by the telephone company, which, after the three bidders revise their acquisition terms, will select one bid based on the improvement principles established by the advisory committee and submit it to the two municipal councils for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3>Naval Nomination for Training Conference Representative</h3>

<h3>Petition by Workers of the Steel Plant Concludes</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Steel Plant suspended operations due to financial difficulties, the workers, fearing hardship due to the shutdown, sent representatives Chen Deheng, Du Jinbang, Han Songru, and Li Wenhuan to Nanjing to petition the National Government for a solution to maintain operations. The representatives returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is reported that as a result of the petition, Chairman Chiang of the National Government, due to being busy with the Third Plenary Session, instructed them to contact the Ordnance Administration. Du and others then went to the Ordnance Administration, where they were personally received by Director Chen Yi, who reassured them and stated that the new plant director, Mr. Zhou Zhihong, had been instructed to come to Shanghai within a week to take over. After taking office, he would first carry out reorganization. He also stated that among all steelmaking institutions in the country, Shanghai is the only plant. Although it is currently suspended, the Ordnance Administration is always thinking about expanding it, but is constrained by economics and cannot actively proceed. As for the issue of ordnance factories refusing to use steel materials, a notice will be issued to all factories across the country, requiring them to purchase as much as possible. The representatives were satisfied and returned to Shanghai by train the day before yesterday. After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, they heard that Ordnance Factory Director Guo Chengen had sent a letter to the Municipal Party Headquarters, so they also submitted a request to the higher-level Party Headquarters in the name of the 29th Branch of the First District Party Department, requesting that Guo be given a warning. The original request is transcribed below: "Request to be submitted to the Municipal Party Headquarters, requesting that personnel be dispatched to investigate the steel products and prices of the steel plant to clarify the truth and maintain it. We, as the Shanghai Steel Plant, have been directly and indirectly sabotaged by Director Guo Chengen of the Ordnance Factory in the same city, leading to a standstill. We have issued a declaration to arouse the sympathy of the people of the country to seek relief, without any other intention. However, Director Guo does not realize that his actions are harming domestic goods and instead speaks plausibly, sending a letter to the Municipal Party Headquarters, blaming the steel plant for its inferior goods and high prices, claiming that he had no choice but to take this destructive action. The facts are clear and cannot be concealed. (Omitted) Now Director Guo openly advocates for the suspension of operations and even suggests that placing workers in various ordnance factories is a proper solution. However, it is well known that the ordnance factories do not have steelmaking work, and it is questionable whether skilled steelmakers can be made to switch to manufacturing weapons. This argument has already dealt a significant blow to the steel plant. However, this is still indirect. The direct blow that could lead to the death of steelmaking is the overturning of the 30-year-old practice of selling steel plant products and the rejection of domestically produced steel in favor of purchasing foreign goods. According to his original letter, his excuses are that the steel ingots rust and are too hard, leading to the problem of barrels cracking. The steel plant was founded during the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty (1875-1908), and the steel produced has been inspected and found to be extremely pure, surpassing what foreign products can achieve. It has produced over a thousand various cannon blanks, tens of thousands of rifle barrel blanks, and thousands of machine gun barrel blanks for decades without any reports of explosions. Regarding steel ingots, from the 27th year of Guangxu (1901) to the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929), the Longhua Factory alone purchased over 10,700 piculs of steel ingots, and other provincial ordnance factories also purchased over 3,000 piculs, without any objections. Only now, with Director Guo, has there been talk of being too hard, rusting, and being prone to cracking. When, where, and what type of gun exploded? There are no facts. Even if it happened, there could be various reasons, such as impure gun steel or poor manufacturing, and the true cause must be investigated, not solely blaming the steel ingot. Moreover, upon closer inspection of the original letter, the statement that 'the problem is prone to cracking' is purely hypothetical and unfounded. How can this be convincing? Regarding the value, except for those exceeding the market price by 10%, all steel should be purchased from the steel plant. In other words, steel exceeding the market price by 10% will not be purchased from the steel plant. Please first investigate the steel plant's pricing. Is it true that it exceeds the market price by 10%? Review the steel ingot prices before July 1929: 100 yuan per picul; steel materials within 1 inch: 28 cents per pound. From July 1929 to January of this year, steel ingots ranged from 70 yuan to 80 yuan to 85 yuan per picul. Starting in February of this year, due to the soaring gold prices, it was changed to 90 yuan. The steel ingots that Director Guo purchased from the steel plant were all 80 yuan or 85 yuan per picul, which is 12 yuan to 7 yuan less than the 92 yuan per picul for German steel ingots. Steel materials within 1 inch were priced at 6 cents per pound, which is 1 cent less than the 7 cents per pound for German steel materials. Clearly, the steel plant's prices are lower than foreign goods, but Director Guo fabricated his words, claiming that he abandoned domestic products in order to reduce costs and avoid significant losses. This is a deceitful statement. If domestically produced goods are more expensive than foreign goods, even if there are losses, it is a case of 'losing one's bow, but another finds it,' but the outflow of rights and interests is the true loss. Moreover, with the same steel products, before July 1929, steel prices were 80% more expensive than now. In the past, various factory directors purchased various steel materials worth over 10,000 yuan per month. Why didn't we hear of them refusing to purchase due to losses? Only after Director Guo took office in September of the same year, and after seven months, the total value of steel ingots and steel materials used was only over 30,000 yuan. The reason for this is the so-called comments that 'the quality is too hard, it rusts easily, and it cracks easily.' Is it true that all previous factory directors were deaf and blind, willingly suffering losses without caring? Only Director Guo is wise and bright, discovering losses that previous directors did not discover and resolutely abandoning domestic products, willing to painfully destroy our country's last remaining steel plant and open up a market for foreign goods? Otherwise, he must have other motives. In short, this is one right and the other is another right. The truth must be investigated on the ground to clarify the truth. It is reasonable to request that the Ministry investigate and approve, and forward it to the Municipal Party Headquarters to dispatch personnel to investigate the facts of the steel plant, impartially judge, and at the same time severely warn Director Guo to purchase domestically produced steel materials in accordance with past practice and prevent the outflow of rights and interests to preserve our country's only steel plant and maintain the livelihoods of hundreds of workers, which is a small matter. Respectfully submitted."</p>
<h3>Yu Da Bank Declares Liquidation</h3>
<p>The Yu Da Bank on Tianjin Road officially closed yesterday and posted a notice on the door stating: "Due to financial difficulties, this bank is declaring closure. We have sent a letter to the Bankers' Association to entrust Yuan Hanyun and Wang Fushang, lawyers, to jointly liquidate the assets. We apologize for any inconvenience caused. This is to notify."</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Requests Tax Reduction on Tobacco via Telegram</h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce requested a tax reduction on tobacco via telegram to the Ministry of Finance yesterday: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: According to a telegram from the Guangzhou Chinese Cigarette Merchants' Association, the actual price of 6th-grade taxed tobacco is 257.62 yuan, and the actual price of 7th-grade taxed tobacco is 128.8 yuan. If transportation costs need to be increased, the limit should be no more than 10% for 7th grade and no more than 5% for 6th grade, and it is a customary allowance without any explicit public announcement. Merchants are deeply concerned. Now, with the soaring gold prices and customs duties levied in gold, costs are increasing significantly. Even if the customs followed the custom to make a decree, the loss is still substantial and the discount is unbearable. The capital of each company is weak and it is difficult to support. The only option is to appeal for a clear decree to specifically allow the 6th and 7th grade taxes to increase by 20% according to the original price, so that there is room for flexibility to make up for the loss. If merchants do not lose money, the tax will also be profitable. The public and private sectors are interdependent. In addition, when actively promoting domestic goods, it is especially hoped that you will give special attention. In addition to separate presentations, we hope for your support and await your reply. We are also preparing to check and forward the question. We also received a frugal telegram from the association stating that since the soaring gold prices and the sudden increase in costs, the daily losses have been huge and it is difficult to sustain. Various companies are eager to increase prices to make up for the loss, but they are forced to endure it due to the association. We hope there will be a change soon. For this reason, we telegram again and earnestly request that you quickly maintain and forward the request to the Ministry of Finance to give leniency to the 6th and 7th grade tax amounts in order to save the crisis. It has been noted by the Association that all materials needed for cigarettes mostly come from foreign countries, so the daily increase in gold prices and the increase in costs is indeed a real situation. The association has repeatedly telegraphed the Shanghai Tax Bureau about this matter, and the bureau is expected to have telegraphed your ministry for instructions. In view of the above, we hereby telegram again, hoping that the Ministry will consider the merchants' difficulties and approve the association's request and transfer it to be implemented, which is convenient for the public. The Shanghai Special City Merchants' Organization Consolidation Committee respectfully asks."</p>
<h3>National Goods Maintenance Association Appeals for Equality in Porcelain Tax</h3>
<p>According to the Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association, a public letter from the Jiangxi Jingdezhen Ebang Porcelain Industry Tongqing Association and representatives from various gangs stated that the collection of porcelain tax by the Jiangxi Porcelain Special Tax Bureau is obviously unfair, hinders business, and requests assistance. After the Executive Committee meeting, it was decided to forward the letter to the Shanghai Porcelain Association for verification and reply. Yesterday, the Shanghai Porcelain Association replied, stating, "We have received your letter, and have also been copied the letter from the Jiangxi Jingdezhen porcelain merchants regarding the Jiangxi Porcelain Special Tax Bureau's inability to treat all porcelain merchants equally, favoring the Sanliang, Gankan, and Shanbang gangs, and paying the special tax at a discounted rate. We are consulting your association's opinion for handling. Upon investigation, the porcelain merchants of various gangs purchase the same goods in the production area, transport them to the same location for sale, but the tax rate cannot be equal. They suffer from the pain of the same goods having different taxes, so that the porcelain merchants of Sanliang, Gankan, and Shanbang gangs can easily sell their goods due to the low tax rate, and their business is thriving, while the other porcelain merchants who pay the full tax are declining due to high costs. Furthermore, in mid-March of last year, when the Jiangxi Finance Special Commissioner summoned porcelain merchants to the province to discuss tax rates, the porcelain merchants of various gangs had to return to their stores to account for their accounts after the end of the lunar New Year, and only gradually arrived in the town between April and May of the lunar calendar. Therefore, the representatives sent were temporarily represented by the porcelain merchants' line and were not formal porcelain merchants, so they did not know the situation. All the information in the letter from the Jingzhen gangs and your association is true. Please give your full support to achieve the goal of equal treatment for all porcelain merchants. We cannot express our desire enough." After receiving the letter, the association truthfully forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting that they order correction and equal collection in order to facilitate transportation and sales and maintain national goods.</p>
<h3>City Port Authority Postpones Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government received instructions from the Executive Yuan, stating, "For compliance, the Shanghai Special Municipal Government previously submitted a report for the Port Authority being prepared for establishment, and submitted the detailed rules of organization for review and filing. The Yuan then ordered the Ministry of Finance and other five departments to review and reported National Government Directive No. 446, which was forwarded by the Yuan to the municipal government to re-draft the aforementioned detailed rules. Subsequently, the municipal government re-drafted the Port Authority's detailed rules of organization and submitted them for review. The Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Navy, Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Construction Committee were ordered to jointly review them. Subsequently, the departments and committees submitted their review of the Shanghai Port Authority's detailed rules of organization and added their amendments, requesting instructions. It was then presented at the 56th meeting of this Yuan for detailed discussion. It was unanimously stated that the powers of the Shanghai Special Municipal Port Authority conflicted with the responsibilities of the central ministries and commissions. Therefore, when this Yuan previously reviewed the detailed rules of organization of the bureau by the Ministry of Finance and other five departments, it was deemed difficult to implement. Since the National Government directive had already been presented, and the bureau was prescribed by the organizational law and had been approved for establishment, the re-drafted detailed rules of organization of the municipal government should be amended in accordance with the review reports of the departments and committees, and the statement that the municipal area had been managed by the customs on behalf of the shipping administration should still be temporarily managed by the customs in accordance with the fundamental principles of shipping administration, and presented to the National Government for approval. However, at a time when the military affairs have just ended and finances are short, all administrative expenses must be economized. In order to save expenses and reduce disputes, there is no need to urgently establish the Special Municipal Port Authority at this time. It can be established after the concessions are recovered. It was also resolved to present the Yuan's opinion and the review process, along with the amended detailed rules of the departments and committees, to the government for approval, and the case was presented to the government for approval. Now, we have received a letter from the First Class Secretariat of the National Government's Civil Affairs Office No. 1028, which opened to reveal that the 63rd State Affairs Meeting of the National Government discussed the case presented by your Yuan regarding the joint review by the Ministry of Transportation and other committees of the Shanghai Municipal Government's revised detailed rules of organization for the Port Authority, requesting instructions. It was resolved to present the Yuan's opinion and the review process, along with the amended detailed rules of the departments and committees, to the government for approval. The case was resolved to be handled accordingly, and the case was recorded and forwarded to be complied with. It should be complied with and forwarded for postponement. In addition to replying to the letter and issuing separate orders, the municipal government should be ordered to comply immediately. This order."</p>
<h3>Destruction of Putian Banknotes Scheduled</h3>
<p>▲ Municipal Government Consults Ministry of Finance for Joint Handling</p>
<p>The Municipal Government previously received a letter from the Ministry of Finance stating that the Putian Industrial Bank illegally printed banknotes and requested that they be investigated and confiscated. The Public Security Bureau was ordered to confiscate 440,000 new banknotes of the bank, totaling 300,400 yuan, and two original lithographic plates. It is now learned that the bureau plans to select March 11 as the date for the destruction of these banknotes and the original lithographic plates, and has reported and transferred the matter to the Ministry of Finance to send personnel to come before the deadline to jointly handle the matter.

<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Urges Li Fang to Go to Nanjing via Telegram</h3>

<h3>Mr. Peiqi Lectures on Imperialism</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Peiqi, an American expert on social issues, gave his third lecture, still held in the auditorium of the YMCA. The topic was "The End of Imperialism." Despite the heavy rain, the audience was even more crowded than the previous two days. Wang Zhiren presided, Chen Liting translated, and Yang Bingxun provided shorthand transcription in the national pronunciation. He stated that the definition of imperialism is when a superior nation rules a weaker nation with economic and political power. There are four reasons for its occurrence: (1) industrial needs, (2) satisfying its ambition, (3) international jealousy, (4) wanting to fulfill its so-called white man's burden. Imperialism also has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are: (1) it can make social organization stable, (2) industry and commerce develop, (3) people's livelihoods are abundant. The disadvantages are: (1) aggression, (2) it is easy to cause international wars, (3) it is easy to cause reactionary resentment. The future direction should be to restore the freedom of the oppressed. As far as China is concerned, the special rights of the powers in China and all unequal treaties should be abandoned as soon as possible to complete China's autonomy and organize an international alliance to save people from difficulties. Someone asked how foreigners can help China, which is to not sell arms or provide silver to the reactionaries. Now, we must not only overthrow imperialism, but also establish a stable government, and then create an international cooperative organization to resolve international disputes by peaceful means. Today, imperialism has reached its end, but after the people are liberated, there will be many problems worthy of our research, and we should guide them step by step. The audience was deeply moved. Today's topic is the future of society. Mr. Peiqi has deeply studied this issue and will surely make great contributions.</p>

<h3>Baoshan Was Dark During the Day the Other Day</h3>
<p>▲Black Air Occurred on the Sea Surface</p>
<p>At around 8:30 AM the other day, the entire city of Baoshan was in the midst of market time. Suddenly, black air filled the sky, obscuring the sunlight, and it was instantly dark and indistinguishable. All stores, large and small, temporarily lit candles. The black air gradually dissipated after half an hour and returned to its original state. After investigation, it was said that the black air occurred on the sea surface outside the North Gate of Baoshan. The strangest thing was that when the black air was thick, the general residents looked at the sky and saw a white rainbow in the sky. The black air was in the northern part of the rainbow, while the southern part had no black air, as if there was a boundary. When the black air dissipated, the white rainbow also disappeared immediately. At the same time, the waves in the sea were turbulent and soon calmed down. Since this incident occurred, the general superstitious people have been discussing it, but Wusong is only six miles away from Baoshan, and there were no abnormal signs on the same day and at the same time. It is really a strange thing.</p>
<h3>Lake Bandits Robbed a Liner the Other Day</h3>
<p>▲The Shanghai Liner Was Robbed in the Xupu Pond</p>
<p>▲The Accountant Ge Shen'an Died and Three Were Injured</p>
<p>The Shanghai No. liner of the Shanghai-Pinghu Liner Bureau, which runs between Pinghu and Shanghai, was the victim of a serious case of robbery, interception, and gunning down of the accountant to death the other day (i.e., the 3rd) morning, when it was sailing from Shanghai to Pinghu. It is now found that the liner bureau has two small liners, one named Pinghu and one named Shanghai, which burn diesel and are dedicated to the daily shift between Pinghu and Shanghai (the small liners of the Qingji Liner Bureau run the night shift), and do not tow company ships. It starts anchoring at 7:00 AM every day, passing through Wangjiadu, Sanlintang, Shigang, Minhang, Desheng, Songjiang, Yexie, Tuolai Temple, Zhujing, Xupu Pond, Maokou, Xinda, and arriving in Pinghu. The small liner stops at all the above piers to allow passengers to get on and off. At 7:00 AM the other morning, the Shanghai No. liner started anchoring from Ping, and sailed near the Xupu Pond, (about sixty to seventy miles away from Ping). Unexpectedly, there were more than ten bandits in the liner disguised as passengers sitting in the smoking compartment and passenger cabin. At a signal, a bandit ship full of bandits, each holding guns, ordered the liner to stop, and the bandits in the liner also took out pistols and forced the captain to stop the engine. After a while, the bandit ship approached the small liner, and about thirty to forty bandits boarded the liner in a swarm and searched the accounting room and passenger cabin, etc., and no passenger was spared. All the silver dollars hidden on their bodies and the valuable clothes and belongings they carried were searched. The liner's accountant, Ge Shen'an, was shot and seriously injured when the bandits demanded the key to the silver box, and died after a while. When the bandits were searching, they also sent bandits to monitor the captain, the ticket seller, the ticket collector, and the more than ten crew members and mechanics, who were not allowed to move freely. All the cash in the accounting room, the silver dollars entrusted by the passengers, and the property, clothes, bedding, boxes, etc. carried by the passengers were moved to the bandit ship by the bandits. They boarded the boat, whistled, set sail, and fled. Before leaving, they fired several shots in the air to show off. In this battle, a total of five to six thousand gold was lost, and the accountant Ge Shen'an was killed. The place is under the jurisdiction of Zhujing in Jinshan County. It has now been reported to the county government and the public safety bureau of water and land to separately investigate and arrest the stolen goods and punish the bandits. After the robbery of the liner occurred, the Qingji small liner on the night shift, which was docked in Pinghu, did not dare to start anchoring that night and was delayed until the next morning. Therefore, it was several hours late when it arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai liner sailed to Xupu Pond at about 11:40 AM the other day. Suddenly, a large group of one or two hundred lake bandits, each holding quick guns and box cannons, rode on seventeen bandit ships and drove quickly on both sides, and then fired a volley of shots from both sides at the Shanghai liner. The liner's accountant, Ge Shen'an, (from Pinghu, 46 years old, with five sons and three daughters,) poked his head out of the liner to ask what was going on. Unexpectedly, a bullet flew and hit his left temple, exiting from his right temple, and he immediately fell to the ground and died. Also, the small accountant Ge Yizhi was also hit by a bullet in his leg, and only cried out, "Not good." Two passengers, one hit in the shoulder and one hit in the sole of the foot, both fell to the ground in extreme pain. The other passengers were curled up at the bottom of the cabin. When the liner's captain saw the bandits swarming on the liner, he had to beg them, saying that the liner had stopped and should not open fire. At this point, the lake bandits turned over boxes and cabinets and searched wildly for about an hour before they were finished, and then took the number and returned to the team, each riding the bandit ship and heading towards Taihu Lake. After the passengers and others checked, a total of more than one thousand silver dollars were robbed, and the goods on the ship were also robbed for about a thousand yuan. Witnesses said that the lake bandits were wearing very generous clothes, all of which were silk and wool, and each had a piece of red cloth on their left shoulder as a mark. Now, Zhang Fengshan, the manager of the Shanghai Liner Company, is anxious to handle the aftermath and went to Pinghu yesterday to deal with it.</p>
<h3>A Female Bandit Deceived and Kidnapped an Apprentice from a Family Sock Factory for Ransom</h3>
<p>▲A Wuxi Girl Came Suddenly</p>
<p>▲The Apprentice Was Deceived and Never Returned</p>
<p>▲The Wedding Date Is Approaching and the Bride Is Very Anxious</p>
<p>▲The Bandit Sent a Letter Asking for Money to Redeem Him</p>
<p>Ye Chagen, an apprentice in the accounting room of the family sock factory at No. 25, Lane 7, Peifu Lane, Huanghe Road, French Concession, was suddenly deceived by a female bandit on the 28th of last month and has been missing ever since. It was not until yesterday that the bandit sent a letter ordering the factory to notify Ye's family to prepare the price to redeem him. Judging from the situation, it is the same as kidnapping for ransom. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Ye's Family Ye Ming Chagen is 70 years old.</p>
<p>He is from Wan'ao Village, outside the East Gate of Shangyu, and his family has been farming for generations and has a small amount of land. His parents are both healthy and live in their hometown. Ye was introduced to the factory to study by Xu Jinsheng, a fellow villager who is now the accountant of the family sock factory, in early February of last spring.</p>
<p>▲A Bobbed-Hair Girl Ye has been diligent and thrifty since entering the factory to study. Usually, except for being sent by the factory manager or accountant, he never goes out alone. Unexpectedly, at about 6:00 PM on the 28th of last month, a bobbed-hair girl, about twenty years old, wearing a jade-colored Mingxing silk cheongsam (red buttons), speaking with a Wuxi accent, went straight to the factory's accounting room.</p>
<p>▲Someone from Home When the girl entered, she asked the factory staff, "Where is Chagen?" At that time, Ye was beside her, looking closely at the girl, and did not know her. He immediately asked her what was the matter. The girl said, "Just now, someone from your (referring to Ye) family came to my house (the girl claimed) and said that there was something important that needed to be discussed with you. Because I am not familiar with the roads in Shanghai, I specially asked me to come and take you with me."</p>
<p>▲Going Out in the Same Car After the girl finished speaking, many factory staff who were listening were all looking at each other in surprise. They immediately asked her where she lived. She said that she was currently living at No. 1, Lane 1, next door to the Jiaxing Sock Factory on Xinqiao Street. At that time, the staff thought that Ye's family members from the countryside often came and sometimes went out together, so they did not suspect anything. After speaking, Ye went out with the girl and hired a rickshaw to go all the way.</p>
<p>▲Gone Like a Wild Goose After Ye left with the girl, he did not return until late at night. The people in the factory became suspicious and rushed to Xinqiao Street to inquire, but they could not find any trace of him. Only then did they realize that they had been deceived. However, it was not convenient to publicize it at that time. On the one hand, they urgently sent a letter to Ye's family, and on the other hand, they sent people to look for him everywhere.</p>
<p>▲A Letter from the Bandit Suddenly, a few days later, at about 8:00 AM yesterday, the factory suddenly received a letter from the bandit, which roughly said that Chagen had been sent to Nanjing and ordered the factory to quickly send a letter to Ye's family, instructing them to prepare a large sum of money and wait specifically to redeem him. The letter did not specify a place to contact them, nor did it specify how much the price was. The envelope only stated that it was sent from Zhenru. The factory has now sent this to Shangyu.</p>
<p>▲The Wedding Date Is Approaching It is said that Ye himself has been scheduled to get married in his hometown on the 11th of this month. If he had not suffered this setback, he would have returned home today to wait specifically for the wedding date. Now, the factory manager Chun Ziwan and Ye's maternal uncle Wu Quanfu have urgently sent a letter to Ye's parents, ordering them to come to Shanghai as soon as possible to discuss a solution.</p>
<h3>A Young Woman Repeatedly Asks the Women's Association for Help</h3>
<p>▲Zheng Baobao Abuses His Wife</p>
<p>▲The Concubine Orders the First Wife to Wash Clothes</p>
<p>▲Lu Cuiying Requests a Divorce</p>
<p>▲The Judge Still Advises Both Parties to Reconcile</p>
<p>Lu Cuiying, a young woman from Pudong, is at the prime of her youth. She married Zheng Baobao, a native of Anhui, as his wife. Zheng's home is located at the junction of the French Concession on Daxi Road. After marrying Lu, he also cohabited with a woman and was unable to treat his first wife fairly and abused her. Last autumn, Lu turned to the Women's Association for help. After mediation by the association, a settlement agreement was signed, stating that if she was abused again, she would be subject to legal punishment. After both parties signed, Lu returned home. Unexpectedly, after only a few days, Zheng instigated his concubine to beat her severely over the issue of washing clothes. As a result, Lu turned to the Women's Association for help and is still living in the association, waiting for a legal solution. After Lu requested help for the second time, the association, at Lu's request, had its legal advisor, Lawyer Wu Chengyu, represent Lu Cuiying in suing Zheng Baobao in the Provisional Court for abuse and abandonment, demanding a divorce and alimony of 10,000 yuan. This case was specially heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Ye in the 13th court. According to the plaintiff, she was betrothed to the defendant by her parents at the age of seven and married him at the age of seventeen. She has now given birth to two sons, one six years old and the other four years old. After marriage, she initially formed a small family separately. It was not until September 23, the year before last, that she moved back to live with his concubine and began to be abused by him. She was beaten several times a month. The most severe beating was on August 4 last year, when she was bruised all over her body. On that day, she turned to the Women's Association for help. On October 4, the settlement was reached, and she returned home immediately. However, his concubine also wanted to order her to wash clothes for her. She could not be her slave, so there was a conflict. The defendant then instigated the woman to beat her again nine days later and turned to the Women's Association for help again. There is really no way, so she had to request a divorce and ask for 10,000 yuan for living expenses, and to raise the two sons herself, etc. Lawyer Wu also explained the reasons, saying that according to the law, the two boys should belong to the defendant, but the children are still young, and she is afraid that they will be abused by the concubine in the future, so she requested that the plaintiff raise them, etc. When questioned, the defendant Zheng Baobao claimed that the woman he cohabited with was initially living separately. Because the plaintiff insisted on meeting her, he allowed them to meet. The two of them were initially very friendly because they were living together, but he had never abused the plaintiff. However, the plaintiff liked to travel outside and often did not return. Once, he found her in her uncle's house, but he did not know where the two children were hidden. She also asked him for ten yuan a month for pocket money. He is currently a driver, and his monthly salary is only forty yuan. He still has to support his elderly father, so he agreed to give her four yuan a month. As for the divorce, it is not his wish, etc. Judge Ye said to him, "You only earn such a meager salary each month, why do you cohabit with another woman?" Zheng confessed that it was just a moment of confusion. On that day, he and his concubine quarreled over washing clothes, and he did not beat her. Judge Ye then advised him, "Now I will reconcile you. You should drive out the concubine and give a written guarantee that you will not abuse the plaintiff again. Then you can still let the plaintiff live together." Zheng promised to obey. The judge then persuaded the plaintiff to compromise, but Lu claimed that the defendant's statement that he had driven out the concubine was not sincere. As the saying goes, it is easier to change the rivers and mountains than to alter one's nature. The defendant had also sworn that he would never restore his feelings for her. However, since she and him are not compatible, she is also unwilling to grow old with him, so she asked for 10,000 yuan for living expenses so that she could study again, etc. While speaking, tears streamed down her face, and her appearance was quite moving. However, Judge Ye finally hoped that the two parties would reconcile, so he postponed the case for seven days, allowing the two parties to go out and mediate again. If the reconciliation fails by the deadline, he will continue the hearing.</p>
<h3>Tang A'mei, the Accomplice in the Kidnapping Case of Chen</h3>
<p>▲Transferred and Brought to Justice</p>
<p>▲Sealing the House</p>
<p>Tang A'mei, the bandit who harbored the hostage in the kidnapping and ransom case of Chen Tianxi, a member of the Yangsi Township Municipal Committee, was captured by the Fourth Branch of the County Public Safety Bureau in Dong Sanlintang and sent to the Shanghai General Bureau for interrogation. The detectives of the Municipal Public Safety Bureau sent a document to the County Public Safety Bureau and reported it to Director Shen. Director Shen approved and ordered the bandit Tang A'mei to be taken away for interrogation. On the one hand, Director Shen reported the situation to the county government. Magistrate Leng has verified Tang's confession and confirmed that she is suspected of colluding with the kidnappers. Therefore, yesterday he instructed the County Public Safety Bureau to transfer and instruct the Fourth Branch to seal Tang A'mei's house immediately.</p>
<h3>A Rural Woman Is Infatuated with Her Lover</h3>
<p>▲Husband and Wife Called Each Other in Court</p>
<p>▲Willing to Go to Jail Rather Than Return Home</p>
<p>The woman Tao Chunxiang, from Jiangbei, is twenty-nine years old, looks respectful, but is actually romantic. She was betrothed to a man surnamed Jiang by her parents, but because the Jiangbei area has been suffering from famine for years, and it is difficult for the common people to make a living, Jiang was unable to marry her, and Tao's father found it difficult to support her, so he sent her to Shanghai to live with her uncle Qiao Dexi. Qiao now sells vegetables at the Xiaocai Market on Henan Road and lives at No. 291 there. Unexpectedly, Chunxiang, having reached the age of marriage, suddenly felt lonely. On the 23rd of January, after lunch, she left with Yang A'san, a fellow villager. Yang is a rascal who does everything from robbery to kidnapping and has been punished by the authorities many times, but he has never repented. Now that he has kidnapped Chunxiang, he has hidden with her. Although Qiao knew that she had been abducted by Yang, he did not know where they were hiding, so he thought that there was no hope of her return. The other day, Qiao was passing by Sichuan Road Bridge when he unexpectedly met Yang. He reported him to the Hongkou Police Station. Not long after, Chunxiang heard that her lover had been arrested, so she also returned from somewhere in Zhabei. She was also sent to the Women's Prison and detained. Yesterday morning, they were both sent to the Provisional Court, where Judge Wang Jianzu opened the court for interrogation. First, Qiao Dexi stated the circumstances of his niece's abduction and the process of finding Yang. Next, Chunxiang confessed that she ran away with Yang Lao San because she had a quarrel with her aunt. At first, they lived in a hotel, and the travel expenses were paid by me by taking off the cotton-padded jacket and trousers I was wearing and handing them over to Yang for pawn. Later, Yang and I moved to a friend's place in Zhabei. When we were in the hotel, my husband and I lived in the same room. Although I was betrothed to a man surnamed Jiang by my parents, it was not what I wanted. Judge Wang obtained the confession and advised her, "You are not yet twenty years old and are still a minor, so you are still subject to the guardianship of your parents. Since you have been betrothed to a man surnamed Jiang, how can you call Yang your husband? May I ask, who is your husband and who is your wife? I am afraid that you still do not understand." Unexpectedly, this rural woman misunderstood the judge's meaning and replied bluntly, "Since he lives with me, then he is my husband and I am his wife." Many listeners smiled. Next, Yang Lao San confessed to the abduction. Judge Wang ruled that the defendant Yang Lao San, a recidivist who does not repent, should be punished in accordance with Article 257, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, and sentenced him to one year of imprisonment. The woman was handed over to her uncle to be taken back. However, the woman was infatuated and did not want to go back with Qiao, insisting that she was willing to go to jail with Yang. Although she was repeatedly and earnestly persuaded, she held her ground and even refused to get up on the spot. Judge Wang then changed the sentence and ordered Jiang Chunxiang to be sent to the Jiliang Institute, to wait until she reached the age of twenty and then be free to decide.</p>
<h3>A Rickshaw Puller Is Suspected of Colluding with Robbers</h3>
<p>▲Suddenly Taking a Small Road Midway</p>
<p>▲Three Robbers Arrived Suddenly</p>
<p>Dai Ji, an employee of the Finance Bureau of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, lives at No. 193, Thin License, Xinxin Lane, Jin Shenfu Road, French Concession. On February 26, at around 7:00 PM, he hired a rickshaw pulled by Shen Wenhua, a native of Jiangbei, at Lujiawan to go home. Unexpectedly, on the way, several robbers blocked his way and threatened him with pistols. His leather robe and mandarin jacket and other items, worth a total of 340 yuan, were robbed and escaped. Later, the victim reported to the police that the rickshaw puller Shen Wenhua was suspected of being involved. Shen was arrested and yesterday was brought to the French Concession court for questioning. First, the plaintiff complained about the previous situation and said that it was raining that day. There were four rickshaws in total. On the way, the defendant's rickshaw suddenly branched off and wanted to take a small road. At that time, the merchant thought that the small road was deserted and quiet, and there might be robbers, so he instructed the defendant to take the main road. Unexpectedly, the defendant ignored him and continued to run forward. After a few steps, he stopped suddenly. Suddenly, three robbers came and stopped him, claiming that they were "Chao Bazide." The merchant thought that the police were "Chao Bazide", which was normal, so I raised my hands and let them search. Unexpectedly, the bandits immediately took off my clothes and robbed me of my silver dollars and fled. At that time, the defendant was watching the situation nearby without any panic, which clearly showed that he was colluding with them. After the incident, the merchant still took his rickshaw home, reported the incident to the police, and requested an investigation. When questioned, Shen Wenhua claimed that it was raining that day, so the people took the small road to make it easier and did not dare to collude with the robbers. He asked for a clear investigation. Judge Zhu ordered him to be detained and wait for the facts to be investigated before questioning him again.</p>
<h3>Water Patrol Seizes Firearms on Three Fishing Boats</h3>
<p>▲Although with Permits</p>
<p>▲Still Suspicious Points</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau’s Water Patrol Team discovered that the "Xin Wan Xing," "Jin Shun Xing," and "Weng Fa Xing" fishing boats, docked outside the Wan Yu Wharf in the Nanshi area of the Huangpu River, contained a large number of firearms. Detectives such as Zhang Yuting were dispatched to inspect the three boats. They seized eight rifles and one thousand rounds of ammunition, four large knives on the “Xin Wan Xing” fishing boat; eight rifles, one thousand two hundred rounds of ammunition, one Flobert rifle, one thousand seven hundred and sixty rounds of pistol ammunition, and four large knives on the "Jin Shun Xing" fishing boat; and eight rifles and one thousand rounds of ammunition on the "Weng Fa Xing" fishing boat. The manager of "Xin Wan Xing," Pan Humu, the manager of "Jin Shun Xing," Chen Xueshan, and the manager of "Weng Fa Xing," Li Yongxing, were taken back to the team along with the evidence. During the preliminary trial by Team Leader Xu, Pan confessed that he was 51 years old and from Haimen. He claimed to have obtained a permit from the Jiangsu Provincial Civil Affairs Department in April of last year for these firearms for self-defense purposes, and presented the permit for verification. Chen confessed that he was 45 years old and from Taizhou, and that he had applied to the Fourth District of the Water Police for a permit for the seized firearms on February 26th of this year, paying the district 20 yuan in permit fees, presenting the original permit for review. Li confessed that he was 35 years old and from Taizhou, and his confession was similar to Chen's, also presenting the firearms permit issued by the Fourth District of the Water Police. The team leader pointed out that the National Government had issued an order in August of the previous year to all agencies and announced to residents that all permits for self-defense firearms must be guaranteed and submitted to the government for issuance to be valid, with a fee of only one yuan per firearm. The fact that the Fourth District of the Water Police was suddenly issuing such permits raised suspicions. Considering the seriousness of the matter, he ordered that a document be prepared immediately, along with witnesses, and submitted to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for thorough investigation.</p>

<h3>Last Words of a Victim of an Involuntary Marriage</h3>
<p>▲Cui Feng Jumps into the River, but the Water is Too Shallow to Die</p>
<p>▲Zi Fan is Crippled, Why Harm Others?</p>
<p>Around 9 p.m. the day before yesterday, a woman named Cui Feng, approximately twenty years old, wearing a purple woolen qipao, elephant-skin-soled velvet shoes, white cotton socks, and a modern bob haircut, arrived at the Jiaxing Road Bridge in Hongkou, carrying a suicide note (addressed to her parents). She jumped into the river in an attempt to end her life. Fortunately, the river was not deep, and she did not drown. She was rescued and taken to the police station, where she was changed out of her wet clothes. The police chief questioned her about her name and the reasons for her suicide attempt, but she refused to reveal any information, only saying that she lived in the countryside near Yinxiang Port, and that both her family and her husband's family were respectable merchants, and she did not want to disclose her name. A suicide note was found in her pocket (the original is transcribed below). Judging by the original text, the vocabulary is clear and fluent, indicating that she had received at least a middle-school education. Due to marrying the wrong person, she had conceived the idea of suicide. The police chief dispatched someone to hire a car to accompany the woman to her home in the countryside near Yinxiang Port, and handed her over to her family. Her family paid the car fare of ten yuan and earnestly requested that the visitor not disclose the address to save face. The original suicide note that was found is transcribed below. The suicide note was enclosed in an envelope, which was placed inside the cover. It read: "To My Beloved Parents."</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>"Greetings. To my dear parents: I, your daughter, was married to Zi Fan at your insistence. My life was created by you, and it should be controlled by you. However, you should not have pushed me into a trap, preventing me from entering places of joy and the bright road, and enjoying the pleasures of the boudoir. Perhaps this is due to fate, but I cannot help but blame you for your lack of discernment. Did you not know Zi Fan's true character? Did you not know of his disability? I think back to the marriage of my older sister. Was it not your choice? How loving and affectionate they are, while I am so resentful. Is it some kind of evil that is at work? What else can I say? I can only enter the Yellow Springs and end my life. Perhaps I will be reborn in another life and fulfill the wishes I have in this life. I wish you both peace and good health. Your unfilial daughter, Cui Feng, weeping."</p>
<h3>Health Bureau Registers Restaurants</h3>
<p>▲License Fee One Yuan...Half Price in Rural Areas</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau is registering restaurants for the year 1919 in accordance with regulations and issuing management rules to each establishment for review, in order to emphasize public health. Restaurants in rural areas can report through the Municipal Committee Member of their respective district for verification. As of the end of February, 2,736 restaurants have been registered in the Nanshi and Zhabei districts, 84 in the Wusong district, 102 in the Jiangwan district, 34 in the Gaoqiao district, 99 in the Tangqiao district, 40 in the Zhenru district, 44 in the Luxing district, 25 in the Yinhang district, 31 in the Fahua district, 9 in the Gaohang district, and 4 in the Caojing district. Registration is still ongoing. Those who operate without a license after March 15 will be fined double. The purpose of this registration by the bureau is to urge all restaurants to pay attention to hygiene and facilitate inspection. The license fee is only one yuan per license (only half a yuan in rural areas). Upon approval of the license, the license holder shall directly pay the fee to the Revenue Office of the Finance Bureau, and then obtain the license upon presenting the receipt. The bureau's primary concern for all restaurants is to prohibit the sale of food and beverages that are unhygienic, and equipment and utensils must also be kept clean.</p>
<h3>Woman Sues for Cohabitation with Husband</h3>
<p>▲Husband Claims Wife Ran Away</p>
<p>▲Cohabitation Requires Return of Clothing</p>
<p>Zhang Zuicheng, a native of Yancheng residing at No. 1333 Datong Road, was recently sued by his wife, Xu Xiuzhen, for abuse and eviction, requesting an order for cohabitation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye of the Provisional Court held a hearing. According to the plaintiff, she married Zhang in the fourteenth year. On February 5th, Zhang suddenly brought a concubine home and evicted me. At that time, I was taken to the Xinzha Police Station. Since being evicted, I have had to stay temporarily at my mother's house at No. 227 Guangzhao Road. I heard that his concubine sued my husband for divorce in the local court last year, and now she is actually cohabiting with the defendant, etc. According to the defendant, he is engaged in the car industry. When he went to Zhabei, he was introduced to the plaintiff by a friend, Yu Dechang, and then they got married. In the seventeenth year, a son was born. The plaintiff consorted with bad people and often left home without returning. On the morning of February 4th, she suddenly ran away with 200 yuan in cash and silver dollars, and clothes worth 300-400 yuan. I inquired at her mother's house, but there was no trace of her. I filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court. Now, if she still wants to cohabitate with me, she must return the stolen property. Otherwise, I must sue her for punishment. However, Xu Xiuzhen resolutely denied stealing money and clothes, saying that all the clothes had been sold to Changsheng Funeral Home by Zhang, and he used the money to buy opium for himself and his concubine. He spends three or four yuan on opium every day. Zhang then presented several photos of the woman to the court, proving that Xu had a large number of beautiful clothes. After the interrogation, Judge Ye instructed both parties to await sentencing on the afternoon of the eighth of this month.</p>

Cao Zhiqing, the husband of the deceased, stated that he did not know the defendant and now requested to claim the body. After Gao Jun verified the confessions, he declared that it was verified that Cao Gao had been killed by Wang Bingqian with a hammer. The corpse was to be claimed by her husband for burial. Wang Bingqian was sent to the court for interrogation.</p>

They have been brought from the Western Prison. Judge Sun then questioned the two Lius, but they firmly denied knowing Jiang. Western Detective Daweier then presented a case stating that the two Lius had been brought to the police station the other day, and Jiang Xingchu was mixed in with eighteen other criminals. Liu Honggen could not identify him, but Liu Guangwen recognized him immediately and said, "That's Jiang Xingchu!" Now they deny knowing him, which is a dishonest denial. According to Zhang Wang, the deceased’s wife, Jiang Xingchu and my husband previously had a conflict over a reward of three yuan for a certain matter. On that day, Jiang and several others came to my house and called my husband out to talk. I also followed. Several dozen steps away from the house, I heard Jiang say, "Open fire!", and witnessed Jiang and several others each open fire with handguns. My husband was shot five times in the back and once in the leg, and shouted, "Jiang Xingchu, you shouldn't have shot me over this small matter of three yuan!" Then Jiang and the others fled. What I have said is all true. If there is any falsehood, I am willing to be punished. I have an elderly aunt and children. Please grant me justice. Jiang Xingchu was questioned, but he still denied the crime. After the interrogation, Judge Sun ordered the defendant to be detained for sentencing on a fixed date.</p>

At that time, the woman lived in the rear building of No. 271 next door. The day before yesterday afternoon, Fang Zhongyou and Fang Chen, a couple who lived at No. 271, had an argument. Unintentionally, Zhongyou blurted out the fact that Chen had abducted Zhu's son. Chen Zhu heard this and confronted him.

Around 9 p.m. the day before yesterday, Fan had to go out, leaving only Fan's elderly mother at home. Three bandits took the opportunity to break in, threatening her into silence, and looted all the silver dollars, clothes, and other items before fleeing.

Yesterday, she reported this to the Fourth Precinct of the Third District of the Public Security Bureau. The police were dispatched to arrest Yang. Yang confessed that he did not engage in theft, but that he had an older brother named Yang Qinglang, who lived at No. 7 Houde Lane on Wusong Wai Ma Road. He came here the other day and suddenly returned to Wusong this morning. This was very suspicious, and it was not known whether it was related to the case.

After arriving in Wusong, they reported to the Chief of the Seventh District of the Public Security Bureau, who dispatched Officer Dai to assist in the arrest. When they arrived at Houde Lane, they saw a person walking out of No. 7. They questioned him and he was Yang Qinglang. He was immediately arrested on the spot. Sixteen five-yuan bills were found on him. At this point, Yang knew that he could not hide the truth and confessed that he had gathered a gang to rob Fan Wenting's house. Officer Liu took the suspect back to Laoshusha for prosecution and continued to pursue the remaining accomplices for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Summary of Losses on the Huangpu River Due to Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>In recent days, the wind has been strong and the sky has been raining. Many cargo ships on the Huangpu River were caught unprepared. A rice boat named Zhang Bosheng from Dujiaobang carrying 175 stones of rice to Shanghai for sale was overturned by the wind. He set sail early in the morning of the day before yesterday. The wind was very strong and Zhang's wife saw the situation and wanted to stop sailing to avoid the danger. But Zhang heard that the price of rice in Shanghai had soared to over twenty yuan and was eager to get to Shanghai and sell it as soon as possible so that he could obtain a large profit. So, he continued to sail as usual and refused to moor. He was sailing near Toufubang in the southern Huangpu River when the wind and waves crashed onto the ship. At this point Zhang was about to turn the helm to sail towards the shore and moor to turn around when a gust of wind overturned the entire ship. Those on the ship were fortunate to be good swimmers and floated to the shore and got up. However, the ship and cargo were lost. Now they are planning to hire a boat to try to salvage the sunken ship. Also, the goods on Gu Akun's ship carrying sea cargo from Longrun Haihuo Store on Minguo Road to Hangzhou, moored in Minhang South to avoid the wind. However, the helm was turned too late and the ship was sunk by the wind and waves. Three people were rescued by a Jiangbei ship, but Gu and Xuecheng were still missing. Furthermore, Meng Aqian of Longyan Shipping in Zhejiang Province, loaded with bamboo shoots and other goods for Shanghai, went astray and ran aground on a rock bar in Liuhekou. The ship was damaged, resulting in a large loss. Also, the Ding Ada ship of a certain customs broker, carrying 800 bags of flour, set sail to Wusong yesterday morning. While passing the unloading company's ship, they sailed to Gaoqiao East and a sudden gust of wind and waves swept the flour on the deck of the ship, while the flour that was not swept away in the cabin was wetted. One of the crew members was blown into the Huangpu River. In addition, many cargo ships had their goods wetted by the wind and waves, or their equipment blown away.</p>
<h3>Small Steamer Collides and Overturns Sampan</h3>
<p>▲Chinese Constable Falls into River and Drowns</p>
<p>Yu Jinfu, Chinese Constable No. 31 of the Customs Water Patrol Station in Lujiazui, Pudong, boarded a sampan from the Chunjiang Wharf in Lujiazui at 10 p.m. on the 27th of last month to patrol the river. At that time, the Maoxin small steamer of Maotai Foreign Firm on Hankou Road was speeding from north to south. The distance between the two was not far. Because the sampan did not hear the small steamer pull and release its horn, it quickly turned its head to avoid it towards Pudong. The captain of the Maoxin small steamer, Gu Genfa, became anxious for a moment and also drove towards Pudong, causing the sampan to be hit broadside and overturned. The Chinese constable and the sampan man both fell into the Huangpu River. Seeing that a disaster had occurred, the small steamer attempted to throw a life preserver to save them, but the rope attached to the life preserver was too tight and could not be untied in time, causing the Chinese constable to sink to the bottom of the river and drown. The sampan man was rescued. The constable's body has not yet been recovered. His family has offered a reward for its recovery. The deceased was 28 years old, from Shanghai, and had served in the police station for five years. He leaves behind a mother and a wife and has no descendants. The situation is extremely tragic.</p>

<h3>Russian Swindles Money with Forged Bill of Lading</h3>
<p>▲Request to Reduce Bail Denied</p>
<p>Qiao Ning, a Russian, mortgaged a forged bill of lading to Datong Bank on the tenth day of last month. The bill stated that there were 80,000 yuan worth of pig bristles and sought a 6,000 yuan loan. At that time, Qiao Ning claimed that the goods had been shipped to Qingdao and would arrive in Shanghai soon. The Datong Bank believed him and paid the money. Later, it became clear that it was forged, so he accused him of fraud and obtaining property. The police station had detained him and brought him to the Provisional Court, where he was instructed to post bail pending trial, as previously reported. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Gao Junxiang conducted the trial. An American employee of the Datong Bank testified about the circumstances of the fraud. Judge Gao, not having heard the defendant's testimony, immediately instructed the defendant to continue to pay a bail of 10,000 yuan. The defendant's lawyer stood up and requested a reduction in the amount of bail, stating that the defendant did not have this large amount of money, so he was still in custody. He requested that it be reduced to 5,000 yuan, which would be easier to pay, but the court did not approve it.</p>

Fortunately, the fire brigade was notified and rushed to extinguish the blaze. Afterward, the police arrested a suspect named Zhang Jinhai and brought him to the police station. Yesterday, he was brought before the French court for investigation. First, the plaintiff recounted the events, stating that merchants were repairing a machine under the car at the time, so they did not know how the fire started. However, a young worker named Lin A'er witnessed it, but Lin was not present today due to an incident. When questioned, the defendant vehemently denied the accusation, claiming that he has never smoked, and requested an investigation. Judge Zhu instructed him to leave and await the arrival of witnesses for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Request to Reduce Horse Racing Tax Denied</h3>
<p>The International Recreation Club, citing a recent decline in horse racing business income, submitted a petition to the Municipal Government requesting a temporary reduction in the horse position tax commission to 12 percent to compensate for the losses. After receiving the petition, the Municipal Government stated that horse racing is inherently a form of entertainment. The recent decline in the industry has multiple causes and is not solely due to the current tax rate.

<h3>Additional Temporary Freight Trains Added to Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway</h3>
<p>Due to the recent congestion of goods being shipped in and out by various transportation companies on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, in addition to the regular daily night and day freight trains No. 21, 22, 25, 26, which are operating as usual, the original temporary freight trains No. 23 and 24, which were scheduled to run every other day, are now running daily due to the congestion. Yesterday, the Zhakou Station telegraphed the Shanghai Traffic Department, stating that the existing goods waiting to be shipped at the station were very congested and required 60 train cars.

She stated that she was 15 years old, from Xinghua County, and her father's name was Shi Dingchun. He worked as a domestic helper in Shanghai. She lived in Xiaodongmen, but because she had only recently arrived in Shanghai, she did not know the name, street, or house number of her residence. The girl was wearing a checkered teal jacket, floral cotton trousers, blue cotton socks, bound feet, and blue embroidered cloth shoes. She has been transferred to Xin Puyu Hall for care while awaiting family members to claim her.</p>
<h3>Notable Progress in Silk Dyeing Industry Debt Collection</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Dyeing Industry Labor-Capital Jointly Organized Dyeing Price Committee, based on resolutions of the Board of Directors and the Committee, and following the regulations of various silk shops' original orders, implemented the Gregorian calendar and tasked the accounting department to collect debts from various silk shops in groups. The progress of collecting dyeing fees for silk fabrics dyed by various factories in February (Gregorian calendar) has been quite good in recent days, demonstrating that various silk shops can consider the difficulties of the dyeing side.</p>
<h3>Settlement of Wine Allowance Issue in the Blue Dyeing Industry</h3>
<p>Due to high prices and difficult livelihoods, the workers in the Shanghai blue dyeing industry, through a meeting of representatives of the Shanghai Blue Dyeing Industry Union, submitted a request to the Municipal Training Council for record on February 5th to the Shanghai Cloth Industry Association, proposing an increase in wine allowances. After exchanges of letters and negotiations lasting a month, the Social Bureau mediated once on March 1st, but no resolution was reached. Recognizing that both parties insisted that they would suffer losses, the heads of various workshops made every effort to mediate, and finally, yesterday (the 4th), a draft agreement to increase the allowances was signed. A formal contract will be signed within this month. The union has notified the industry association to check, and all employers who have received approval for the increased dyeing prices should start dyeing, but the dyeing workers will no longer be responsible for the work of (opening cloth, nailing the surface, and stamping) for the cloth shops in the future.</p>

<p>▲Son – Father, there's too much sugar in your coffee. Two cubes are enough for me.</p>
<p>Father – Silly child, this is a restaurant. It's a set menu. Everything is included. Take a few more cubes. It doesn't cost extra.</p>
<p>▲A – Do you really believe that ignorance is bliss?</p>
<p>B – I don't know, but you seem very happy. Clearly, you're very blissful.</p>
<p>▲Wife A – When I got married, I had hoped to reform my husband, to make him as good as I am. Who knew that I wouldn't achieve my goal. I'm really suffering. Wife B – What happened? Is your husband a vicious person who wouldn't listen to you? Wife A – Oh, no. It's just that he's even better than me. He doesn't need me to reform him.</p>

<h3>A Discussion of Edison's Habits</h3>
<p>— Chen Yuanliang</p>
<p>Being bored in my room, I happened to read an article about the inventor Edison in a recent American magazine. The material came from his wife's account, which was very interesting. I translated it below for readers' amusement.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Edison is old, his personality is still childlike. Could this be a sign of returning to youth as a sign of longevity? Before leaving the house, he always kisses his wife, a habit that has lasted for decades. His wife always sees him to the door, making a simple farewell. Their affection is very deep. Lately, he has been paying attention to the rubber business, so his home is now filled with rubber air. Everything he talks about, thinks about, and even dreams about is rubber. Although he likes to eat yams, he is wary of them due to his age. He hates medicine like an enemy. He likes to watch comedies with music and old-fashioned films starring Mary Pickford or Clara Bow. However, he has little interest in sound films. He calls golf and dancing the entertainment of those who are full all day long. He doesn't like writing letters. Even though his old friend Harvey Firestone frequently sends him letters, he doesn't reply. He deeply admires Mr. Ford. Ford is an American automobile tycoon and also an inventor. They appreciate each other. He doesn't pay much attention to programs, even Christmas and his own birthday or wedding anniversary. He usually likes to wear old-fashioned shirts, but they need to be made of silk because his skin likes to be in contact with silk. He likes the light and smooth feel. His wife makes him a box of very soft Indian silk handkerchiefs every year. Each piece is about a yard square to suit his preferences. He usually reads books and greatly admires the works of the French writer Victor Hugo, calling him the greatest mind of all time.

<h3>A Record of the Yangon Orphanage for Homeless Children</h3>
<p>— Yun Xun</p>
<p>In our country, there are orphanages and homes for poor and homeless children, providing care and education. For infants who have lost their support, there are foundling hospitals. In Yangon, South Asia, a wealthy overseas Chinese businessman, seeing the street children wandering the streets, exposed to the elements and suffering, felt great pity. Therefore, he founded an orphanage. This is a record of the event for the people of our country.</p>
<p>The orphanage was initiated in the late spring of last year and officially opened in January of the 19th year. Although it took several months, it cannot be said that the progress was slow. The initial stage involved raising funds for the construction of new buildings and preparing a permanent fund. After much effort, the beginning was seen. Once the finances were in place, construction took time. Finally, a vacant lot south of the old hospital in the city was selected, measuring one hundred feet long and ninety feet wide. A large hall, a kitchen, a study room, two bathing and washing rooms, and several workshops were built. The government provided the construction costs, and the initiators were responsible for raising the funds. The city hall donated 2,500 kyats, and the Myanmar Women's Association contributed 6,200 kyats. There is one director-general, one director, and one person in charge of each of the workshops. The hall serves as a practice area during the day and a temporary dormitory at night. A piece of open space behind the hall serves as a sports ground. The orphanage accepts children from the age of seven to sixteen who are homeless and truly poor. It can accommodate more than 500 people. The study room also has evening classes to train them to become useful talents. After they are trained, they are helped to find a livelihood. The orphanage emphasizes physical education, hiring specialists to teach children physical education, with the aim of promoting physical and mental health. Prominent figures are invited to serve as economic trustees to prevent interruptions midway. On the day of the opening, more than 300 children had already been admitted. The workshops are temporarily set up for lacquerware, woodwork, and rattan crafts.</p>
<h3>True Waste Utilization</h3>
<p>— Yan Qian</p>
<p>Before describing the main text, please make a simple explanation of the word "true" to help readers understand the meaning of the main text. The meaning of "true" here is the same as the "true" in "True Old Lu Gao Jian" (a brand name). It does not contain any sacred meaning.</p>
<p>Now, please describe the main text. The waste referred to today is true waste. May I ask, are cow dung, cat dung, dog dung, and pigeon dung not true waste? However, it is rumored that they can all be used to treat diseases. Isn't this a true utilization of waste? I will write down what I have heard in this talk and ask for the criticism of learned gentlemen.</p>
<p>▲Cow dung treats bloating. My friend Boqin once told me that he suffered from bloating as a child. Chen San, an old servant in his family, found a local remedy from somewhere. One day, he stacked bricks and tiles to make a stove and placed cow dung on it, burning it with firewood, saying that he would wait for it to be charred and ground into powder for the young master to take. However, he was eventually stopped after strenuous opposition.</p>
<p>▲Dried cat dung treats measles. Recently, a local charitable organization has been responsible for publishing the saying that dried cat dung can treat measles. It is said that cat dung on the roof that has been through the winter has a miraculous effect on treating measles in children. Decoction and drinking it can have special effects. It is the Holy Medicine for protecting children.</p>
<p>▲White dog dung treats throat disease. When I was young, I often saw servants pick up white dog dung, remove both ends, and store the middle section in the sun. When asked what it was for, they said it was stored for emergencies to help the sick. I also asked what disease required this as medicine, and they said diphtheria measles. Later, I never saw it used, so I don't know how effective it is.</p>
<p>▲Pigeon dung is beneficial for lung disease. I have heard several people say that pigeon dung easily damages roof tiles but is beneficial for lung disease patients. Therefore, the place where lung disease patients are recuperating should raise more pigeons.</p>
<h3>The Miraculous Skills of Xia the Rat</h3>
<p>— Yu An</p>
<p>The martial arts of our country are truly incredible. One would not believe it without seeing it with one's own eyes. Often there are talented and skilled people who live in remote rural areas, not seeking fame or fortune, willing to rot with the grass and trees, so that their lives are unknown to the world. Looking back at the records and newspaper reports, I don't know how many there are. Why is it that today it has become the Guangling San (a lost piece of music) and will never be seen again? I happened to read a gentleman's notes and remembered that there was once a person in my hometown (Wuling) named Xia. His name has been lost. Because of his short stature and his ability to jump, he was called "Rat" at the time. Therefore, even today, the words "Xia the Rat" are still well-known among the people of my hometown, and his real name has been hidden. My late grandfather Yu Longgong once told me his anecdotes. Rat was good at using qi and practiced iron shirt. He could stand naked and let people hit him with iron tools at will. He stood still, and the muscles at the points where the tools hit would swell up like a nucleus, rising with the strike of the tool. He used this nucleus to resist the tool. It could not hurt his body in the slightest. When struck again, there would be another nucleus, responding as if to a sound. If the tool was lifted and struck fiercely at his nucleus, the nucleus would swell and have a repulsive force. Those who struck him would often lose their footing due to the excessive force and fall from the repulsion. He once played a game with people, gathering all the qi of his body into his ears, which were as hard as iron and stone. Even the strength of several people could not move them. His skill in using qi was like this. At that time, there was an old teacher in a certain place who also had superb skills. He admired Rat's name and came to my hometown to visit him, intending to compete with him. Rat declined, but he was encouraged by those who liked to stir up trouble. They went together to a corner of Guangxiao Temple. Guangxiao Temple is in the city and is the largest temple in my hometown. It is very spacious, and the halls have been newly renovated and are very solid. After the two arrived, they stood on the steps of the hall. The onlookers were like a wall. The old teacher was quite arrogant and said to Rat, "Do you know my martial arts? Please consider carefully. Don't leave yourself open to ridicule and damage your reputation." Rat was still modest and said, "Then please show me a thing or two first." The old teacher said, "Good." Then he raised his hand to hold his braid and slowly lifted it up. Both feet followed him off the ground to a height of about three feet. Then he released his hand, and his feet landed on the ground with a bang, as if a hanging rope had been cut. The audience praised him in amazement. The old teacher said with satisfaction, "How is it?" Rat suddenly bowed to him and said, "Your skill has reached the realm of transformation. I am willing to admit defeat." After saying this, he turned and walked to the wall, lay down on the ground, and drilled into the wall with his head. The lower half of this wall was built of bluestone, which was especially solid. In an instant, the stone broke, and Rat had already placed himself outside the wall. He poked his head into the wall from the outside and said to the audience, "My skill is weak. I dare not try it lightly. I'm leaving. Please, everyone, donate money to the monks to repair this hole." The audience cheered and praised him even more. The mouth of the hole was less than a foot in diameter. It was located in the middle of a stone, shaped into a perfect circle, as if it had been carefully carved by a stonemason. Ordinary people would not be able to enter and exit with their whole body, but Rat drilled into the stone with his head, and as he drilled, he came out. In the blink of an eye, the hole was formed, and he had already placed himself outside the wall. It was truly miraculous. Looking back at the old teacher, his face was pale and dejected, no longer as arrogant as before. He left the temple in a daze. However, Rat was indeed miraculous in his skills, but was the old teacher weak?</p>
<h3>Record of Li Yiyuan</h3>
<p>— Fu Qinxin</p>
<p>Since the Gengzi Year, our country has been shocked, and when people talk about foreigners, they cover their ears and run away, as if avoiding fierce beasts. Recently, they have realized the mistakes of the past and want to find a way to avenge themselves. However, they are all in groups of hundreds or thousands, relying on collective action. I have never heard of anyone who, motivated by righteous indignation, resisted them as an ordinary person, still full of anger. In the Jiazi Year, I lived in the capital and heard about Li Yiyuan. His righteousness and courage were enough to inspire the cowardly and corrupt. I quickly wrote it down to encourage my people.</p>
<p>Li Yiyuan was a native of Wanping, Zhili. He was strong and good at running. He was poor and had no one to rely on. He was a cavalryman under a certain general in Ying. One day, he was walking back from Chongwenmen outside the city at sunset when he saw a British soldier standing on the wall, stretching and whistling. He admired him and hurried to climb up. The British soldier stopped him and refused to let him in. Li scolded him and said, "This is my land. Who are you? How dare you be so rude?" Then he beat him and injured him. British soldiers flocked to the scene and surrounded him. Li glared at them and said, "No need. I just want to face your envoy to reason out the right and wrong. Am I, Li Yiyuan, afraid of anyone?" The British soldiers then took him away. That evening, the British envoy sent a note to our government, requesting that Li be severely punished. The government could not refuse and ordered the Wanping magistrate to interrogate him. In the end, due to the power of the foreigners, Li was imprisoned for three months. On the day of his release, thousands of people gathered at the government office to welcome him.</p>
<h3>Humorous Common Sense</h3>
<p>— Tu Hongxia</p>
<p>▲When smoking high-quality cigarettes, smoke the end without writing first, leaving the brand name to show the quality of the cigarette. When smoking low-quality cigarettes, smoke the end with writing first, to cover up the poor quality of the cigarette and avoid being called a poor snob.</p>
<p>▲When wearing bad clothes, you can walk on small roads to avoid being seen by friends. When wearing good clothes, you can walk on main roads to be seen by friends.</p>
<p>▲The more things you put in a trendy handbag, the more documents and letters you seem to have. If you have nothing to put in, just put in two pairs of shorts. Buy two stacks of grass paper to fill it out and keep up appearances.</p>
<p>▲When walking on the street, even if you have nothing to do, you should pretend to be in a hurry to show that you are busy with official business.</p>
<p>▲When entering a pawnshop, you should look around to avoid being seen by friends. You don't have to do this when leaving the pawnshop because you only have a pawn ticket at that time, which can be stored anywhere. If you happen to meet a friend, you can say, "I have nothing to do today. I'm just browsing inside."</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (141)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 9: The Famous Scholars Make a Scene Playing Hide-and-Seek, a Charming Girl Protects with Devotion</p>
<p>Shi Chen never expected that a disheveled and barefoot country girl would gradually become beautiful and more and more lively. This was completely different from the restraint and reservation she had shown at first. She might have the same charming attitude with other guests once she became familiar with them, but at that time, Shi Chen felt that Ruiyun was very uninhibited and impolite with others. Sometimes, when Zuo Shichen arrived at their place and saw that Ruiyun had not returned, he would perfunctorily talk with the eldest aunt. The eldest aunt would always be polite and call him Second Young Master Zuo. When Ruiyun came back, she would laugh and say, "What Second Young Master Zuo? Zuo Shichen is Zuo Shichen." The eldest aunt said, "Our girl is always so clueless. Luckily, Second Young Master Zuo won't hold it against you like a child. If it were another guest, wouldn't they be angry?" Ruiyun said, "Can't I call him by his name? I insist on calling him that. Why can he call me Ruiyun?" Shi Chen said, "You can call me by my full name. Otherwise, why do people in the world have a surname? Why does everyone have a name? It's to be called." Ruiyun said, "Then I won't be polite in the future and will call you Zuo Shichen by your full name." Shi Chen said, "Very good." Although she said that, when Ruiyun went on stage to sing, she didn't call him Second Young Master Zuo or Zuo Shichen because she never called people by name. This temperament was somewhat similar to a clay beauty, a jar that couldn't be opened. Chen Zhuoyun, with her little braids, was somewhat similar. However, if she didn't speak, she would sit silently by the side, her two shiny eyes rolling around. If it were like fighting crickets, opening her pincers, she could talk endlessly. One day, it was Shi Chen's fellow villager's sixtieth birthday. Although this old man was sixty years old, he was still a romantic old man. He could play mahjong in the brothel for twenty-four rounds in a row. He didn't give up or say that his back was sore. On his birthday, many people advocated for a party, the more the merrier, saying that they wanted to make a "thousand flowers offer birthday." That birthday man let them do as they pleased. Among them, two acquaintances knew that Zuo Shichen was dating Hua Ruiyun, so they didn't need to ask his permission and wrote him a party ticket and sent it out. At that time, eight tables of wine were set up in a large hall, and there were very many guests. So, wine tables were set up in the study room and in the attic above the study room. Zuo Shichen was sitting in a corner of the study room. Ruiyun came and first circled around the hall. Because Ah Jin had gone elsewhere that day, she came alone. She couldn't find Zuo Shichen. People said that he wasn't in the hall and might be in the study room. Ruiyun peeked into the study room but didn't see Shi Chen. She became a little anxious and shouted, "Where is Zuo Shichen? I'm called by Zuo Shichen! Hey, has Zuo Shichen come?" When she shouted like this, people all stared at her with strange looks.</p>

<h3>The Gold Market Suddenly Improves Amidst the Financial Riot, Ten Taels Extracted</h3>
<p>▲ The Situation in the Market is Dangerous</p>
<p>▲ Deeply Transgressing Market Conditions</p>
<p>▲ Fluctuations Still Reach Thirty Taels Throughout the Day</p>
<p>The bidding gold situation in the past four days has been full of changes, as if a hurricane and torrential rain, disordered and unrestrained. The rise and fall of prices have transgressed normal standards, with a difference of up to thirty taels. Dealers' psychology is extremely disturbed, without any clue. Buying and selling in a confused manner is unbearable. In the early market, Wanxing, Shunli, Taixing, Hengxing, and others all bought in, while Yucheng, Yongyu, and others sold out. The price initially contracted greatly in the morning, and then rose, reaching the 500 tael mark. Later, due to news that the National Government would levy import tax on raw silver or implement restrictions on imports, the atmosphere became fearful, with a tendency to collapse, falling by more than ten taels, eventually falling below 482 taels. The atmosphere was bad. Afterwards, as foreign exchange stabilized from weakness, major players felt that they were buying receipts, and they had already broken through the 90 tael mark, rising more than ten taels. Subsequently, Hengxing, Taixing, Yufeng, Yong, and others successively competed to buy. It is now known that there is no order to levy silver tax, and with the foreign exchange turning strong, it trended high, suddenly jumping to above 510 taels. Afterwards, the market was unusually chaotic with great waves, with ups and downs of several taels. In the end, it was around 506 taels. In short, such changes are rare. Yesterday, the near-term London silver bar contracted by one-sixteenth, and the far-term contracted by one-quarter. The price of silver also fell by five-eighths. The exchange rate has not changed.</p>
<p>▲ Opening Price Reached as High as 500 Taels</p>
<p>The opening price for August bidding gold was 499 taels and 5 mace, an increase of 4 taels. Next was 500 taels. In a flash, all parties sold, and the overall atmosphere was poor. The gross price fell sharply by 18 taels, eventually dropping to 481 taels and 3 mace. The initial announcement was unchanged, only that the daily gold hung a large 2.5, at 84 taels and a half to 3.5 taels. The internal situation turned peaceful again, more stable than the early market. Mitsui bought June at 11 pence 875, Maihang bought 11 pence 75, Mitsubishi bought April at 11 pence 6875, Mitsui and Dehua counter-traded April at 11 pence 625, and even major players flocked in. After 10 o'clock, it had already broken through the 90 tael mark. Until 11:30, it jumped up more than 12 taels, at 96 taels. The bank also bought June English gold at 11 pence 5625, but the daily gold had few transactions. Afterwards, it suddenly turned unfavorable, due to selling activity. At 11:45, it was 91 taels and a half, followed by ups and downs of 2 taels. At noon closing, it was 493 taels and a half.</p>
<p>▲ The Highest Price in the Afternoon Market Reached 511 Taels</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened as high as 499 taels, followed by 500 taels, then 97 taels. The market conditions were chaotic, but the trend was upward, because the silver import tax would not be implemented, and major players such as Hengxing had strong buying intentions. People's hearts suddenly became firm and high. Afterwards, foreign exchange bills were also tight. The bank counter-traded June English gold at 11 pence and 625. After entering, Sumitomo bought 10 pence 875, Shanghai bought 10 pence 875 to 8125. June daily gold was available for sale at 1.05875, which, if settled, would be more than 1 tael and 6 fen. These various reasons were sufficient to cause a good situation. In one leap, it surged 13 or 14 taels, reaching 511 taels at 3:30. Afterwards, sellers became active again, and went downstream, but it was also messy and disorganized. Until 3:45, there were ups and downs of 8 or 9 taels. Subsequently, it rose from 502 taels to 507 taels, which was actually shifted by the amount of buying and selling on the table. After 4:15, it was slightly less than 1 tael, and the market closed at 4:30 at 505 taels and 8 mace, which was an increase of 10 taels and 3 mace compared to the previous day. Therefore, the exchange held a double closing price.</p>
<p>▲ Great Ups and Downs, the Exchange Held a Double Closing Price</p>
<p>The highest price was 511 taels, and the lowest price was 481 taels and 3 mace, a difference of 29 taels and 7 mace, which is rare. The posted price was 528 taels and 6 mace because the daily gold increased by a large 2.5, initially suppressed by a small 44 or 5 taels, 34 or 5 at noon, registered at 93 to 94 taels, supplementary water at 92 taels. In the afternoon, registered at 504 to 505 taels, supplementary water at 504 taels. The posted price was suppressed by 30 taels, to 21 or 22 taels. The early opening price for goods was 498 taels and 6 mace, noon closing 92 taels and 8 mace, 98 taels in the afternoon, closing price 505 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Dalian Replenished in the Morning and Threw Again in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Dealers' buying and selling, suddenly demanding and suddenly supplying, had no fixed standard. It is estimated that Hengxing, Bingxing, Taixing, Yuanda, Yuanmaoyong, etc. all entered, Wanxing and Shunli jointly entered 5,000 receipts, also sold 2,000 receipts, Yuda, Yucheng Yong, Yuanheng, and retail investors all sold out. The Dalian gang replenished 5,300 or 400 receipts, and the Guangdong gang entered and exited about 1,000 receipts. The transactions of each firm, it is estimated that Yuanmaoyong, Taixing, Yufengyong, Hengxing, Shengda, etc. all entered, Wanxing, Shunli, Yuanheng, Tongtaichang, etc. all sold. The entry and exit of other firms were very different. In short, the chaos in the market was unspeakable. The Dalian gang again sold 4,000 some hundred receipts, then entered 1,700 or 800 receipts. The entry and exit of hedged receipts were inconsistent.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Like a Hare and a Falcon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listed foreign exchange, except for Hong Kong, decreased by 2 taels, calculated at 79 taels. Daily exchange added 2.5, calculated at 1 tael and 9 fen and 5 li. Initially, there were no changes (only the words "no market" were posted first). The great bar fell to a new low, and the Indian exchange had increased by 375, calculated at 52 rupees 9375. Also, Yokohama City was as before. Kobe had no changes in the morning but suddenly rose in the afternoon. The domestic English, American, and Japanese markets were tight from the morning, suddenly turned decadent, and then showed a strong trend. In the afternoon, it turned weak from strong, and finally seemed to ease. This was actually because the gold market was stormy and the ups and downs reached 30 taels. Therefore, people's minds were unusually confused. Chinese merchants and speculators sold no less than 300,000 to 400,000 pounds of English exchange. Banks had a good appetite, such as Zhengjin, Taiwan, Shanghai, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Maijia Li, HSBC, Great Britain, Holland, Sumitomo, East Asia, Industry and Commerce, etc., all absorbed. Also, each bank traded 100,000 pounds with each other. There were not many US dollar transactions, only Industry and Commerce slightly entered. Dalian currently entered tens of millions of yuan. Banks such as Mitsui, Zhejiang, and the Mainland sold some. This was because the rise and fall of the gold price was too great and hedging was not easy to do. Until the afternoon, compared to yesterday, the prime rate contracted by 5625, the US dollar contracted by 1 yuan 125, and the daily gold rose by 2 fen 25.</p>

<p>▲ The Great Bar Near and Far Enter Within 19 Pence</p>

<h3>Interest Rates Slightly Rise, Discount Rates Still Weak</h3>
<p>▲ Market Overview</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for Chinese and foreign money was slightly more prosperous than in the past, so the market price was slightly firmer. In terms of silver capital, compared to the previous year's current low and insufficient support, due to the impact of the Yuda Zhuang grounding incident that occurred the day before, industry insiders were tight with each other, inevitably rising. However, now the discount tickets have been changed, and the silver is full in the warehouse. The Zhuang had already repaid the discount tickets to its counterparts, so there was no slightest impact. Therefore, yesterday's silver discount situation did not change from the past. However, the industry was slightly more cautious.</p>
<p>▲ Interest Rate Discount Price (Foreign Interest)</p>
<p>The buying enthusiasm was slightly stronger in the morning, and the supply side showed weakness, so the interest rate was slightly higher, at 7 mace 2 fen 06 hao 2 hu and a half, which was 3 hao and 7 hu and a half better than the early market the day before. The market situation was silent again in the afternoon, and as a result, the interest rate changed to be 1 hao and 2 hu and a half lower, at 7 mace 2 fen 0 half li. (Silver Discount) In the early market, the transfer account was borrowed in vain, and the silver discount market was also the same. There was more than enough heading lining for the discount tickets as before, so the trend was difficult to change. The bank's listed price also had no market price, and the head plus water was opened at 2 fen, and then drawn in vain.</p>
<p>▲ Subsidiary Coin Market Situation (Corner Foreign)</p>
<p>There were few transactions of Jiangnan small foreign coins yesterday morning, with no supply or demand. Afterwards, someone wanted to buy 3,000 corners, and the seller firmly wanted 6 mace 2 fen 1 li, and the transaction was finally concluded, but it had risen by 1 fen compared to the previous day, but no one objected, so it was the price for the morning market. There were no transactions in the afternoon market, and the market price was as before. Guangdong small foreign coins were 5 mace 9 fen 8 li in the early market, and 5 mace 9 fen 7 li 7 hao and a half in the afternoon market, with only 2 hao and a half of ups and downs. 105,000 corners were traded in the early market, and 40,000 corners in the afternoon market. Copper coins shrank by 2,000 wen, to 398,000 wen.</p>
<p>▲ Silver Payments Entering and Exiting the Bank</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bank's collection and settlement were moderately simple and comprehensive.

<h3>The Yarn Flower and Yarn Market are Difficult to Recover</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weak and the falling trend is quite sharp. The stock of goods is abundant and the pressure from major sellers is extremely strong, so people's hearts are weak. As soon as the market price rises, the sellers flock in, so the market is even more difficult to revitalize. However, the current yarn sales are smooth, and the Tianjin gang feels particularly developed. In short, there are too many inventories, and it is difficult to stimulate the market without special consumption. Although the exchange rate for San Pin yarn is long, the falling wind is even more severe. Most of the psychology in the yarn market is watching low, and the future is difficult to capture.</p>
<p>▲ Human Standard Continues to Fall One or Two</p>
<p>In the early market of the human standard, due to the fall of American cotton, people's hearts softened, and retail investors scrambled to sell. Each month fell by 5 or 6 cents. The market atmosphere became more tired in the second and third markets, and each month fell by another 5 or 6 cents, and there was great pressure from major players. As a result, each month fell by 8 or 9 cents to 1 tael and 1 cent. In the afternoon, the go-to routes of Tianjin, Sichuan, and Guangdong gangs were still smooth, but people's hearts in the market were still weak and difficult to lift. This month rose by 1 cent, and the far period fell by 1 or 2 cents. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 16,700 bales. The closing price of the human standard is recorded on the left:</p>

<p>▲ Real Demand Tianjin Gang Activities</p>
<p>The current yarn sales are still good and the Tianjin gang is active. It was found that the statistics of the various gangs buying and going to all day were 1,880 bales. 200 bales entered among the peers. The market was slightly tired. The Tianjin gang's entry volume was the strongest among the customer gangs, with 835 bales. In addition, Sichuan had 240 bales, Guangdong had 375 bales, the inland had 80 bales, Hankou had 55 bales, Niuzhuang had 70 bales, Qinhuangdao had 40 bales, Xiamen had 50 bales, Jiangxi had 50 bales, Ningbo had 35 bales, miscellaneous gangs had 60 bales, and the factory opening had 5400 bales.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Continues to Trend Downstream</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending tired and the situation is slightly softer. The Han gang is still pulling tightly and not letting go. The source of current goods from various routes is not open, and the Han price is higher than the Shanghai market. The foreign cotton market is sluggish and there is still a risk of falling, so there are still many sellers of far-month ones. The cotton market has presented a situation of lingering and not moving forward.</p>
<p>▲ Futures Cotton Falls Back Three Cents</p>
<p>In the early market of the Han standard, following the foreign cotton and tired, the retail investors sold, and the situation was weak. Each month fell by 1 fen 5 points to 3 cents. The market atmosphere was flat in the afternoon, and each month rebounded by 5 points to 1 cent. The total transaction volume for the day was 28,400 dan.

<h3>Humidity Standard of Egyptian Cotton</h3>
<p>The yarn mill representatives of the Egyptian Cotton Industry Federation are convinced that 8.5% can be regarded as the full standard of moisture in Egyptian cotton, but they are prepared to conclude a 12-month trial contract with the Alexandria Commodity Association starting from December 1, 1929, stipulating that if the moisture does not exceed 9%, the yarn mill may not claim the loss of excess moisture. However, if the moisture exceeds 9%, the discount should be calculated from 8.9%. The case has been approved by the 13th International Cotton Industry Conference. The representatives also unanimously advised yarn mills in various countries that whenever the humidity is tested by someone, the test results should be notified to the cotton shippers in Alexandria for reference.</p>
<h3>Food and River Down Rice Market Stagnant and Tired</h3>
<p>▲ The Arrival of Ships was Huge in Zhabei Yesterday</p>
<p>Because the price of Changxi products was reported to have fallen, the merchants packed and sold in Shanghai in an endless stream, while sales in this port turned stagnant. High-quality northern japonica rice was also sluggish, and medium-sized inferior goods were tired by half a corner. The market situation felt quite godless. Although not many early thin rice arrived, the inventory was very abundant. The market price was slightly angled to the left. Sheep Du Xian's separate purchase was not refreshing, and the rural sales were ordinary. The rise and fall of the gold market were uncertain, and the sales of foreign rice turned stagnant and weakened, so each Xian was stagnant and quiet. The price was set high and slightly revised, and the change was consistent and flat, with no honor or disgrace for the time being. The top change was around 16 yuan and 6 corners.</p>
<p>▲ Few Ships Arrived in the River Downstream in South Shanghai, and the Sales Were Quiet</p>
<p>The machinery of Changxi japonica rice was more actively moved, but the buyers drank the plate very tightly, and there was no change in price. The sales of Jiangsu white japonica rice were quiet, and the cargo customers were eager to sell because there was no benefit in waiting for a long time. However, the entry taste was subtle, so the transactions were few. The large plate softened by nearly a corner. The early thin rice in this region, Chonggu, Sijing, etc., were still stagnant in sales, and a small number of cargo owners still wanted to sell the plate, but there were also those who followed the market, but the situation was always sluggish, and only high-quality goods had a little transaction. The sheep Xian and Bu Xian Yongtong gangs picked high and procured, and the tastes of this street were limited, and the market price was stable. The sales of Baiyuan were also quiet, and the goods from the inland continued to arrive, and the price tended to fall.</p>
<h3>The Flour Market Under Margin Control</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for all months continued to fall by more than ten taels due to imported wheat being slightly lower by about 1.2 yuan. Therefore, morale was generally weak, and buyers mostly took a wait-and-see attitude. This month's lowest price returned to 2 taels, 5 mace, 2 fen, 7 li and a half; April to 2 taels, 5 mace, 3 fen; and May to 2 taels, 5 mace, 7 fen, 7 li and a half. However, forward trading was dull, with little fluctuation. By the afternoon opening, due to rumors of a sharp fall in margins, another 500 taels were released, and the sluggish morale turned into enthusiasm. It seems that this type of market price is purely determined by the exchange rate. Not only is it difficult for outsiders to grasp, but even those in the industry do not know what to do. However, realistically speaking, if sales in the north are not smooth and manufacturers do not collect, there is little hope for a good outcome. As a result, the closing prices for March and April were 2 li and a half higher than the previous day, May was slightly lower by 2 li and a half, June and July remained unchanged, and August was slightly lower by 2 li and a half.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market for all months in the morning still struggled to rally due to the previous day's weakness. Imported wheat telegrams were again slightly lower by 1.23 yuan, the gold price fell slightly by more than ten taels, and with the close of orders for imported wheat flour, morale weakened further. March and April were each slightly lower by 1-2 fen. In the afternoon, the gold price rose again to over 500 taels, and short sellers covered their positions, and the market rose again. As a result, March rose by 3 fen, April by 5 fen, July and August each by 1 fen, and June was slightly lower by 1 fen. Transactions of more than 5,000 bags of spot wheat were handled by Fuxin and other factories. The market remained firm, with Shaoxing, Qingjiangpu, and Yaowan wheat selling at 5 taels, 1 mace and a half; Yangzhou wheat at 5 taels, 1 mace and 4 fen; Gaoyou Jiangxi wheat at 5 taels, 1 mace to 4 taels, 9 mace; and Wuhu wheat at 5 taels and 05 fen.</p>
<h3>Signs of a Turnaround in Actual Sales of Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Piece goods trading has become increasingly active. Yesterday, East goods such as Chongsu silk surged by a qian or so due to buying from the Sichuan-Hankou group and limited inventory. Cute Beauty light blue opened at 3 taels and 9 qian, foreign blue at 3 taels and 8 qian. Six-pound Guo Ju red label also continued to rise to 3 taels and 9 qian, and four-pound opened at 3 taels and 1 mace and a half. Fine cloth, 14-pound Signal Soldier sold at 8 taels and 6 mace and a half, Moon Goose at 8 taels and 5 mace and a half, World Joy Bird at 7 taels and 6 mace and a half. More than 200 pieces were traded in the Yangtze River basin, and market prices were firm. Zhigong tweed moved slightly in this street. Moganshan Hunting Goose spot goods are scarce, and price increases are feared. Printed cloth is increasingly declining due to being constrained by local factory goods. Scattered flowers still sold for 4 taels and 5 mace and a half, but stripes have plummeted. Yesterday, Cute Beauty opened at 4 taels and 05 fen, with more than 100 pieces sold. Among West goods, poplin is the most popular, with both local and outside customers increasing their purchases. Assorted plain colors are increasingly scarce on the market. Yesterday, the Shantou-Xiamen group bought more than 30 pieces of striped goods, with Cai Ji Tou at 5 mace and 2 fen and a half, Fair Longjing Temple at 4 mace and 5 fen, and Fair No. 2 at 4 mace and 1 fen. There were also transactions in this street.</p>
<h3>Iron from the Wujin Company is Scarce and Sales are Strong</h3>
<p>The 200-pound iron from the Wujin Company has been selling very well recently. The demand for items such as lard cans, tea boxes, egg cans, cigarette tins, and braised bamboo shoot tins has increased greatly recently. However, due to the scarcity of sources, the spot goods on the market are in short supply, and the standard is also rising steadily. It is estimated that each box can sell for more than 20 taels. Moreover, recently, the foreign exchange is secretly tight, and morale is increasingly anxious, and the market is becoming increasingly firm. According to a recent survey, there are only four to five thousand boxes of spot goods on the market, while daily sales reach as high as six to seven hundred boxes. The recent opening prices for each color are listed below:</p>
<p>Mitsui 18.50 Meikang 20.00 Weili 19.00 Likang 18.75 Fengyu 20.50 Kunhe 19.75</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Doubled Cocoons Silk Exports Exempt from Inspection</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has implemented the inspection of exported raw silk from the first day of this month. Regardless of whether it is machine-made silk or locally reeled yellow, white, or gray silk, it must be sent to the Raw Silk Inspection Department of the Bureau for public weight inspection. The Bureau will issue an inspection certificate to be presented to the customs for inspection and release; otherwise, exports are not allowed. Recently, the export of doubled cocoons has increased daily. There are about four or five Doubled Silk factories in Shanghai, including Jinglun, and the annual output is several thousand bales. The selling price is less than 50% of that of machine-made silk. In the past, the doubled cocoons produced in our country were mostly exported to Japan, and no factories were established for reeling. In recent years, Doubled Silk factories have been established. In order to promote business development, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has notified the Jianghai Customs to exempt all doubled cocoon silk exports from inspection.</p>

<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>▲Chekhov's Drama to be Performed in Shanghai Soon The Xinyou Drama Troupe declared that Anton Chekhov, a great master of Russian literature, is not only good at novels, but also excels at drama. The scripts he wrote were performed by the Moscow Art Theater and have long been praised and performed by people from all countries. As for our country, although it has been introduced in writing by the literary and art circles, it has never been performed on stage. The troupe is rehearsing his masterpiece "Uncle Vanya," which will be performed in about a month. The troupe has always spared no effort in the study of drama art. It has previously introduced Russian writer Andreyev's "Dancing at the Bottom of the Dog," and the results were very beautiful. It is particularly realistic in the performance of Russian sentiment, so it is expected that this "Uncle Vanya" will be even more exciting.</p>
<p>▲Minxin Filming "Spring Dreams in the Old Capital" and "Wild Grass and Idle Flowers" Minxin Film Company declared that our company was founded in Hong Kong in 1914 and is a pioneer in the Chinese film industry. In the winter of 1925, Li Minwei, the company's supervisor, and his wife, Lin Chuchu, destroyed their homes and came to Shanghai to cooperate with Li Junsheng and others to raise as much as 300,000 yuan. They held the grand vision of developing domestic films and engaged in creation. Products such as "Pure as Jade and Clean as Ice," "Goddess of Peace," "Romance of the West Chamber," "Resurrected Rose," and "Mulan Joins the Army" have won the praise of the society and are considered the best of domestic films and can represent the spirit of Chinese art, which is not comparable to the novelty and triumph of European and American countries without any significance. Since 1927, (1) suffering from the congestion of foreign films, (2) failing to the wrong path of film producers, (3) being trapped by the government's inability to protect, (4) and being restricted by foreigners, it has led to a setback. Although the same industry suffers from this, Minxin has suffered even greater losses due to excessive costs. Moreover, in the past one or two years, the film industry has competed for vanity and tried to obscure the dark psychology of society. Minxin could not bear to follow suit and had to postpone progress. Recently, the people have painfully suffered the insults of foreign films and their unconscious hints, and sucking up huge sums of money, and gradually repented, so they encouraged courage and worked hard to create. This time, the scripts of "Spring Dreams in the Old Capital" and "Wild Grass and Idle Flowers" were selected and specially taken to Beiping to shoot exterior scenes. They returned to Shanghai the other day and actively engaged in interior scene work. It will probably not be long before the results of the research can be discussed with the Chinese people.</p>

<h3>Record of the Annual Meeting of the London Buddhist Society</h3>
<p>London News: Since the harm of material civilization is prominent, Western countries feel the need for spiritual civilization, and Buddhism is responding to this trend, with a great resurgence. In recent years, many people in European and American intellectual circles have been studying Buddhism and have organized various groups to promote it. The wonderful way of the Tathagata is about to flourish in the West. The famous Buddhist groups in the United Kingdom are the London Buddhist Society, the English and Irish Students' Buddhist Society, and the British Bodhi Society. The English and Irish Students' Buddhist Society recently held an annual dinner in London, and celebrities from various Buddhist groups attended, totaling about 60 people (not just British people). The arguments of the speakers at the meeting are briefly described below, so that readers can see how Western Buddhist disciples believe in and praise Buddhism. After the meeting, a photo was taken first, and then Mr. Pace, the former president of the Buddhist Society of Great Britain and Ireland (formerly the London Buddhist Society) and the current vice president of the British Bodhi Society, paid tribute to the first guest, Mr. Rostede, and then said, "What moves me most as I travel from seat to seat is that Buddhists can have happiness. When we advise Western people with the teachings of my Lord (referring to the Buddha), we must first let them know that Buddhism is not a kind of dark pessimism, as many writers have described. There are many so-called 'world religions' that suddenly arise and disappear, but on our side there is a special point, that is, when a member goes away because they have lost their belief, or a group stops running because it lacks assets, there are always others and other groups that rise up to replace them. Why? Because my religion is built on the truth and will never be destroyed. We should not force people to believe, but we should do our best to persuade the people of the West, those who are benevolent men and women who do not hold prejudices and have rationality, should welcome the gospel of my Buddha, for this is the right way, the law of the universe, the only great road to happiness."</p>
<p>The first guest, Mr. Stedde, replied, "Thank you, my old friend Mr. Payne, for your teachings. I think the day I first met Mr. Payne was the luckiest day of my life, and the prosperity of British Buddhism today is also due to your efforts alone." He also said, "My teacher, Mutta Deran (Indian), is a person of superior intelligence, in fact, a true scientist. He once did a special test, which I saw with my own eyes. He used advanced mathematics and physics to test the nature of the human mind, proving that thought is in fact a kind of radiation in the ether. He also made an instrument with which people can see their own thoughts. Although he failed to continue to improve the test due to expenses, he has already proved that modern science and Buddhism are in fact consistent. Science and Buddhism belong to one thing, and the deeper we study them, the more we can be sure of it. I once lived in Burma for a long time. Burma is a Buddhist country, and the lives of its people are based on the Buddhist system, and their happiness is also the best of any nation in the world. Why? Because they sincerely believe in the Buddha's teachings. Recently, the eyes of general scientists have been opened by the test of my teacher Mutta Deran, and they have also begun to explore Buddhism. As a result, many of them have been silently transformed by Buddhism, but they have not yet publicly expressed it in writing. This trend is spreading and has spread to the scientific community. Therefore, the opportunity for Western countries to import Buddhism today is ripe, and people are gradually awakening and can receive the Buddha's teachings. In China and other Buddhist countries, virtuous people are diligently engaged in this winning work, and there are no lack of miracles. Now I hope that our British youth will also convert to my Buddha and promote the great road. Today, I am very happy to participate in this international Buddhist gathering, because the thought of international Buddhists gathering together makes me feel unparalleled happiness."</p>
<p>The President of the London Buddhist Society, Mr. Hufre, then said, "When I served the Lord, I always sang a poem in the chapel, the sentence of which is,</p>
<p>Looking far away at the pagan land, darkness still covers it,</p>
<p>Arise, morning star, never again to fall.</p>
<p>I think the so-called 'pagan land' can now be returned to us with this prayer. We can observe the situation in the West with a calm mind and change the words for the Eastern people and sing,</p>
<p>Looking far away at the Western land, darkness still covers it,</p>
<p>Arise, Buddha's light, never again to fall (great applause).</p>

<h3>The Flourishing American Automobile Industry 黄·影·呆·</h3>
<p>▲ Laid-off Workers All Recalled by Factories</p>
<p>▲ Sixteen-Cylinder Cars Now Publicly Exhibited</p>
<p>The American automobile industry holds the leading position worldwide. Its sales volume remains unmatched by European and Western countries. Looking back at the past year, some American manufacturers showed signs of overproduction. Consequently, some ordinary people predicted a decline in the American automobile industry this year. However, facts have proven these predictions wrong. As the old year ended and the new year began, American automobile factories suddenly ramped up production. Laid-off workers were recalled to factories to manufacture new cars. Even before the new cars were produced, merchants from various regions sent letters to place orders. The factories received a continuous stream of orders. If they didn't accelerate production, supply would not meet demand. This year, the business policy of American factories involves using lower prices as a good way to compete. However, a few vehicles, due to cost considerations, not only did not decrease in price but actually increased. Cadillac was the first to raise prices, followed by Buick and Marquette. The former increased prices from US$100 to US$300, while the latter increased prices from US$25 to US$75. The above-mentioned prices were determined by the Studebaker and Buick factories. According to these factories, the cost of this year's new cars is higher, so the selling price had to be slightly increased. However, the value of the new car's content is several times the amount of the price increase.</p>
<p>When the two factories raised their prices, most of the new cars in other factories had not yet been manufactured, so the selling prices were not yet determined. Generally speaking, there are also many factories that will lower the prices of their new cars. When the New York International Auto Show opened, new cars from various factories were exhibited. The novelty of the styles and the excellence of the mechanisms surpassed those of the old cars. Other new trends in this year's new cars include increasing the number of cylinders and adopting front-wheel drive. Most other small cars are the same as the 1929 models, with only slight improvements to the body and chassis. As for the selling price, there have been no changes. In short, the engineers and mechanics of American automobile factories have devoted all their efforts this year to manufacturing cars to ensure the quality of their products and to compete with other factories, to secure a significant position in the 1930 automobile market. Although there are no major reforms in terms of content, in terms of practicality, they are faster and more perfect than the old cars. Therefore, under special circumstances, manufacturers have had to increase the selling price due to cost reasons.</p>
<p>At the New York Auto Show, one car that attracted the most attention was the Cadillac sixteen-cylinder car. Although this type of multi-cylinder car had been talked about for some time, it was the first time it was publicly exhibited. The exhibited new car is the Cadillac V-16, which took three years of research to manufacture successfully. The beauty of the car body is unprecedented. It is safe, stable, and fast to drive, and its power is unmatched by any other vehicle. After the Cadillac V-16 new car was manufactured, some factories also followed suit to imitate it. From now on, the automobile market will have one more type of multi-cylinder car. If there is a phenomenon of demand exceeding supply in the future, the factories plan to manufacture them. As for the selling price of this new car, it has not yet been determined today. It is expected to be the most expensive of the high-priced cars. The Studebaker factory's new car, which was added to the New York Auto Show, is best represented by the President Eight. This type of vehicle is completely manufactured using new methods. The car is extremely long, with a wheelbase of 114 inches. It adopts a new type of heat reduction device. According to the factory, the approximate selling price of the new car can be classified within the US$1,000 car category. In terms of this year's automobile industry, the sales of eight-cylinder cars will surpass those of six-cylinder cars. As winter ends and spring begins, automobile factories generally have a considerable degree of confidence in this year's business, and the selling price of vehicles has also been reduced as much as possible. This is also beneficial to customers.</p>
<h3>Efforts Our Country's Automobile Industry Should Make This Year 石·重·之·</h3>
<p>Time flies like an arrow, and it has been nineteen years. Looking back at the past year, although our country's automobile industry was at the beginning of the National Tutelage period, and also during a time of many local affairs, the government authorities were busy deploying troops and generals, and military documents were flying everywhere. There was little time to promote it, which only made all great plans amount to drawing cakes to satisfy hunger. There is a reason for the lack of significant progress. However, in this city, the Ford Company established an automobile assembly plant in Pudong. The General Motors Company followed suit by establishing the China General Motors Sales Company, opening an automobile school, and planning to purchase land near Yangshupu to prepare for the construction of a branch factory. The Continental Motor Company built a new building, and Buick formed another company. All of this shows that there has been considerable progress in the past year. The automobile industry is on the rise due to the needs of the times. In China, it may be temporarily affected by local environmental factors. However, in other major commercial ports that have not been affected by military operations, its business is booming. For example, the automobile rental industry in this city has made rapid progress. Within a year, car rental companies have sprung up like mushrooms, providing comprehensive services and charging low fees. Some worry that although it may be a temporary surge, it will soon disappear like smoke. However, it is known that this is not comparable to other speculative businesses. Instead of saying that failure is inevitable, it is better to say that it is easy to popularize. It is expected that within a few years, rickshaws will gradually be eliminated. However, this only applies to one or two commercial ports. If we talk about the whole country, it is appropriate to unite all provinces to build roads, which is an urgent task. Secondly, operate long-distance buses to facilitate inland transportation, so that the national routes are as dense as a spider web, extending in all directions without any unreachable places. Then all tutelage matters can be implemented in order. To give a few major examples, such as the military suppressing bandits, popularizing education, and relieving disasters and famine, all will benefit from it. Although these points can also be accomplished by train transportation, the construction of railways is not only costly but also complicated. It is better to build automobile roads, which are cheaper and easier to implement. It is heard that the national government authorities have a plan to borrow foreign capital to engage in the construction of railways. Why not do the cheaper and easier things? Moreover, after the roads are completed, local automobile operations can be contracted out to merchants. There is no better plan than this. However, in recent years, the import of automobiles, if one翻閱 [carefully reads] the customs statistics, the number is quite alarming. Money is flowing out, which is heartbreaking to say. If this continues, the leak will be significant. For the current plan, on the one hand, it is appropriate to gather capital as soon as possible to set up factories to manufacture cars. Engineers may be hired from foreign countries, and raw materials should first use domestic products, or enter into contracts with foreign merchants to operate joint ventures. On the other hand, those with aspirations should study automobile manufacturing, and contribute what they have learned to society in the future. This is also a way to strive for industrial salvation of the country.</p>
<h3>Crowds Throng to See New Cars 霖</h3>
<p>▲ Buick's New Cars for This Year Have Been Released</p>
<p>▲ A Total of Fourteen New Car Models</p>
<p>Buick cars are known for their excellent craftsmanship and beautiful styling. Whenever a new car is released, everyone rushes to see it first. The models for 1930 have been completed. There are a total of fourteen models. The day the news came out, sightseers flocked to Buick dealerships all over the United States. The most crowded were the showrooms on Broadway and 55th Street in New York, where the threshold was almost worn through. Buick's new styles are usually announced in August of each year. Everyone in the automotive industry regards it as a major event. This year is no different from the past, and in addition to the release of new cars, there is also a price reduction, which is even more extraordinary. The Flint factory in Michigan has telegraphed to various places that the prices of various cars with longer wheelbases have been significantly reduced. However, due to the many innovations in horsepower and mechanics of the short-wheelbase cars, the prices have also been slightly increased.</p>
<p>The various new Buick cars for this year not only retain the inherent advantages of the past, but also have many changes in style compared to the 1929 models. They have been refined to perfection, and the outlines of the new cars strive for excellence and are impeccable. The car shape is outstanding and has its own unique style. The radiator shell is more trimmed than before and has an added door stopper. The bumper in front of the car is also rounder than before. The whole car has a belt-shaped hoop, which makes it more beautiful. With the above-mentioned characteristics, once you see it, you can't help but praise it. The various new car models are also longer due to the longer wheelbase, and the car body has also increased in length accordingly. The overall appearance of the car is more beautiful than before. The roof of the new car has been lowered by one inch to match the lengthened body. The seats below have also been reduced by one inch using semi-circular springs, so the rear seat is slightly sunken. With this change, the new car is reduced by two inches without intending to, which benefits both speed and use. The increase in the wheelbase is a noteworthy aspect of this year's new car manufacturing. The large model cars, which were previously 129 inches, have now been increased to 132 inches. The medium model, which was originally 121 inches, has been expanded to 124 inches. The small model has been increased from 116 inches to 118 inches.</p>
<p>The new car's engine power is great and its speed is fast. The Buick cars of previous years could not compare. The large new car uses a valve-in-head engine, and its horsepower is as high as 98 horsepower. The next smaller one is also increased to 81.5 horsepower. The horsepower of the above two types of cars in the 1929 Buick cars was 91.5 horsepower and 74 horsepower respectively. The increase in horsepower is due to the increase of one-eighth of an inch in the drilling holes on both sides of the cylinders. The speed of various new car models is always above 70 miles per hour. Other abilities such as climbing and moving heavy objects have also increased greatly. In terms of structure, Buick cars adopt all mechanical advancements, including four-wheel internal expansion brakes. This type of brake is the most stable and best, and is also a powerful tool for car driving.</p>
<p>Driving is also convenient, especially because of the fully adjustable rotary steering wheel. The front left spring end of the car is equipped with a special vibration reducer. This device, in any aspect, operates very subtly due to the coil spring. No matter what kind of road shock is on the steering wheel</p>
<p>This kind of device is convenient. A simple feature of the new car is the use of semi-elliptic springs, which is also an improvement of the dual-action hydraulic shock absorber. All the movements of bouncing, shaking, and swaying when the car is running are reduced, because the device of the piston in the car can make the various road shocks and bounces all return to a uniform movement. The comfort of the people in the car when driving is self-evident. The Buick new car's excellent performance has been carefully and extensively tested by Buick car engineers of the General Motors Company in the test field. Each of the four-door sedans in each new car is loaded with 450 pounds. The short-</p>
<p>For the two types of wheelbases, the acceleration is accelerated from 5 miles to 25 miles per hour in 6.4 seconds. For the large model, it is 8.7 seconds. The hill-climbing test is also very interesting. All three models have the same ability. A four-door sedan loaded with 440 pounds was tested on a slope of 11% at an altitude of 1,400 feet. The C short model reached the top of the hill at a speed of 26 miles per hour. The speed was increased at any time starting from 5 miles per hour. Large cars were also tested in the same way. The speed was 25 miles per hour when reaching the top. The slope of all highways in New York State must not exceed 6.5%. This is also noteworthy. Each car in the test speed field exceeded 70 miles per hour. The engine operation is lower than that of previous motorcycles.</p>
<p>When testing small cars, it was also found that the fuel economy was better than that of the 1929 models. The reason is that the weight of the car body is equal to the engine power. Although the horsepower of large cars has been increased, the fuel consumption has not increased. The centralized oil system was invented last year, and the models of this new car also use it, which is very satisfactory. The use of this oil system allows for lubrication of various parts in a short period of time without any complications. The colors of the new cars vary. The color matching and style are mutually beautiful. The colors of the cushions and curtains in the car are matched with the colors painted on the car body. This also meets the needs of women. The interior of each new model car is made by Fisher Body, and the layout is very moving. The cushions and curtains are made of a special woven wool velvet, and the floor is made of waterproof cloth, which is very durable. The former is several times higher, and the latter can also</p>
<p>Can be washed. Most of the compartments in each car are equipped with ashtrays and empty boxes. All copper and wood appliances are specially created by Buick. The interior decoration is even more perfect. The seat and driver's seat cushions can be adjusted in height at any time to suit the needs of each person. The adjustment of the seat can be solved in a few seconds. In addition, all parts are also easy to handle. In short, the Buick new car has a beautiful style and is easy to manage, making it a rare find.</p>
<h3>Scientific Management of Japanese Traffic (Continued) 林·英·楣·Translator</h3>
<p>2.  Changes in Traffic Management Equipment</p>
<p>Our country's traffic police have only been established for over a decade. They are directly under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Police Department. Because the matter was a pioneering effort, people felt surprised at the time. However, in recent years, traffic has become frequent and accidents have increased sharply. The public's feelings have also changed accordingly. Over the years, the number of traffic police has increased unabated. They shout loudly and gesticulate under the wind, rain, heat and cold to maintain the traffic safety of the imperial capital. Their spirit of diligence and dedication to public service is truly commendable. However, the chaotic and disorderly situation has not eased slightly as a result. Traffic management is not just about preventing accidents. Traffic agility and speed improvement should not be ignored. To prevent traffic accidents, one can certainly increase the number of traffic police. But in this era of traffic development, agility and speed are of great importance. However, our country's capital does not have any scientific facilities, which is deeply regrettable. European and American advanced countries have long seen this and have invented scientific management methods. They can both replace the labor of police officers and prevent accidents. Since the pilot implementation, the results have been remarkable. The United States pays special attention to this issue, and there are various main law equipment. Describe the changes in management equipment to see its outline. Initially, two wooden boards were used, with the words (進止) [Advance/Stop] written on them. The police held them high in their hands to indicate whether to proceed or stop. The method currently used in Tokyo is the same as that adopted by the United States decades ago. However, the city is becoming increasingly prosperous, and the traffic of pedestrians and vehicles is becoming more frequent. It is even more prevalent day and night. Therefore, this type of management equipment can be barely used during the day, but it loses its effectiveness at night. So transparent equipment was invented to make up for its shortcomings. For the sake of the safety of those directing traffic, small birdhouses were built in the center of the road. In 1917, Detroit, USA, implemented it first. However, it occupies too much space, and traffic is quite obstructive. Recent buildings are gradually becoming smaller.</p>
<p>The method of indicating text signals, such as (進止當心) [Proceed/Stop/Be Careful] and other words, is not inconvenient when viewed from a close distance. However, cars that are driving from afar must slow down to distinguish (進止) and pay attention to the signal. Therefore, text signals are no longer suitable for the needs of the times.</p>
<p>In 1918, the New York City government invented red, green, and yellow traffic lights to replace the text signals of (進止當心) [Proceed/Stop/Be Careful]. Since the trial implementation, the results have been excellent. Chicago, Detroit, and other cities also adopted it.</p>
<p>It can be used both day and night, and it can be seen at a glance without hesitation or delay. These two points alone are beyond the reach of clumsy and immature text signals. Therefore, it swept the world for a time, and people praised it.</p>
<p>3.  The Status of Colored Traffic Lights in Europe and the United States</p>
<p>The value of colored traffic lights in traffic and the great benefits obtained after use have been fully demonstrated in the United States. The American police authorities, driven by moral concepts, first focused on scientific management methods to protect the safety of citizens. Therefore, they urged and guided private companies to manufacture exquisite management equipment without any effort. After painstaking efforts, they finally achieved great success. This great spirit is worthy of admiration and emulation.</p>
<p>For example, the police authorities in Berlin, Germany, erect high signs on major thoroughfares, detailing the meaning of the signals, so that visitors from other cities can know at a glance. They even spare no effort to use various methods such as radio and movies to train the general public. In addition, the state of Carolina promulgated traffic regulations and included them in the curriculum of secondary schools to promote traffic ethics. Their concern for traffic safety is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Germany, which is known for its scientific development, does not deny the value of colored traffic lights in traffic. Therefore, the police department issued an order to adopt them from 1926 to seek thorough popularization. Colored traffic lights have appeared on the streets of the United States, and in a very short period of time, they have become dramatically widespread. Unfortunately, the standards for their use are not as uniform as those in Germany. Therefore, they are adopted arbitrarily. However, in general, red lights still indicate to stop, and green lights indicate free passage. In addition, there are yellow lights, and various cities also use them. Three years ago, when the current President Hoover was the Secretary of Commerce, he initiated the American Engineering Conference to hold the first meeting in Washington, D.C., to raise the issue of the standards for traffic control lights and marker lights. The second meeting was held the following year, and a unified standard was established.</p>
<p>The popularization of colored traffic lights in the United States has been described above. Its rapid development is due to the curiosity of the Americans. For example, Harvard University specially established The Albert Russel Eiskin Bureau of Traffic Engineering and hired Dr. McLean</p>
<p>To take on guidance. In order to study traffic knowledge, it is not difficult to catch a glimpse of the American's solid traffic concepts and the sincerity of government and civilian cooperation.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Province Road Administration Achievements · Wu · Fei ·</h3>
<p>▲ Construction After the 16th Year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province has always had a comprehensive plan for water and land transportation. Since the 16th year of the Republic of China, it has been actively and unreservedly implementing highway facilities. Now, the road administration achievements of the Zhejiang Construction Department over the years are described as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Hangzhou-Shaoxing Road (1) The Xiaoshao section is 52.2 kilometers long. After it opened to traffic in the 15th year of the Republic of China, the income was only enough to cover expenses. Affected by the war, many vehicles were damaged, and business became increasingly sluggish. It was reorganized in the winter of the 16th year of the Republic of China, and new vehicles were purchased and the road surface was repaired. Business gradually improved. By the 18th year, the daily income was about 1,100 yuan. There are now 50 large and small vehicles and 6 trucks. The average daily number of passengers is 1,800. The mileage is more than 3,700 kilometers. More than 260 gallons of gasoline are consumed. Excluding expenses of about 800 yuan, the daily profit is more than 300 yuan, making it the best automobile road in the province. The end point of this road is Xiguomen in Shaoxing, and the starting point of the Shaocao Sheng Road, which is run by merchants, is at Wuyunmen. The distance is seven and a half li, and it cannot be connected. Passengers feel very inconvenient. Therefore, the Highway Bureau was ordered to rush to build the connecting line, which was opened to traffic in May last year. From Shaoxing Station via Changanmen to Wuyunmen, the road is 24 and a half feet wide. The road surface is made of 8-inch original crushed stone. There are three bridges with a total length of 65 feet. There are three culverts, and the total construction cost is more than 71,000 yuan. The average cost per li is more than 10,000 yuan. From then on, going to Ningbo from Hangzhou, directly from the Xiaoshao section to the Shaocao section of the Shaocao Sheng Road, crossing the Cao'e River, and taking the Yongcao train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, it can be reached in less than six hours. It is much more convenient than spending time and money transferring to Shanghai and crossing the sea. (2) The Gongsan section is 13.8 kilometers long. It was opened to traffic in August of the 17th year of the Republic of China. There are currently 38 passenger cars. The average daily number of passengers is more than 4,000. The mileage is more than 1,400 kilometers. More than 80 gallons of gasoline are consumed. The daily income is about 500 yuan. The expenses are about 300 yuan. The daily profit is more than 200 yuan. Last year, because the slope of Wansongling was too steep, it was planned to flatten 4%, which would cost about 15,500 yuan. It is currently being excavated. Vehicles temporarily bypass the city of Hangzhou. Once the project is completed, driving will be safer. (3) Qiantang River Wharf. The old Qiantang River Ferry had a special bureau to manage it. There were eight small steamers and twenty-three tugboats. However, there was sand on both banks. Temporary ramps were erected to avoid wading. A little carelessness could lead to falling. Passengers felt the most pain. Therefore, there was a plan to build a wharf. Construction started in August of the 17th year of the Republic of China and was completed in May last year. The north bank wharf is 880 feet long and 16 feet wide. The front end is widened to 38 feet and 37 feet long, slightly square, as a parking lot. All are built with reinforced concrete bridges. Every 18 feet is a frame. Depending on the height of the terrain and the strength of the soil, four reinforced concrete columns, 26 to 38 feet long and one foot square, are used to support the beams and the bridge deck. The height of the bridge deck is two feet above the high water level. The front end of the bridge is connected to a 60-foot-long steel bridge to reach the steel pontoon boat. The pontoon boat is 80 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 2 feet deep, with a draft of 1 foot. It is tied to the four-plum-blossom piles with iron chains. The central piles of the plum-blossom piles are each 5 zhang long and 14 inches square. Outside the central pile, four piles of 12 inches square and 44 feet long are attached. All are made of wood and tightened with steel plate screws. The plan for the south bank is the same as the north bank. However, the bridge is only 90 feet long. The front end is not widened. At the point where the bridge connects to the bank, a new gravel road of 65 feet is built and protected by a stone slope. At the entrance of the two wharves, there is a majestic reinforced concrete archway with the inscription "Zhejiang First Wharf", decorated with electric lights. There are also lamp posts on both sides of the bridge to illuminate the river. It not only facilitates pedestrians but also enhances the beauty of the Qiantang River at night. The total cost is more than 93,000 yuan. Because the Hangshao transportation can be consistent after the Gongsan and Xiaoshao Hongche, the Qiantang Yidu Bureau has a wharf that is merged into the Highway Bureau for management, so as to unify authority and save expenses.</p>
<p>▲ Yin-Feng Road. It was found that Fenghua to Ningbo is an important route for Ning-Shao traffic. Therefore, in the summer of the 16th year, it was ordered to repair the road. After two years, the entire road was completed in May of the 18th year. Then it was officially opened to traffic. This road is the main road from Ningbo to Rushanting, and the branch road from Jiangkou to Fenghua City. It is 49.3 kilometers long. The road is 24 feet wide. The road surface is made of 6-inch-thick crushed stone. There are 43 bridges with a total length of 1,380 feet. The longest is Yuanzhen Bridge 244 feet, Jiangkou Bridge 339 feet. There are 31 culverts, and the total construction cost is more than 730,000 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Hangzhou-Fu Road. This road was initially contracted and opened to traffic by the Hangzhou-Fu Automobile Company with a budget of 300,000 yuan. Due to the war, the losses were huge. It could not recover. In October of the 17th year, it was recovered for 123,182 yuan, 6 jiao and 4 fen. Business was temporarily suspended. Repairs were carried out. The project was gradually completed in the middle of last year. The road has been opened in sections.</p>
<p>▲ Hangzhou-Chang Road. This road is the fifth longitude line of the road network, which is also a section of the Beijing-Hangzhou Highway. Surveying began in June of the 17th year. The entire section started construction at the same time in October. It was opened to traffic in November of the 18th year. The entire road is 133.9 kilometers long. The road is 24 feet wide. There are 80 bridges, with the Ximen Bridge in Huzhou and the Pingyao Bridge being the largest projects. Each is more than 240 feet long. There are 143 culverts. The construction cost is estimated at 1,216,000 yuan. This road also has a branch line from Sanqiaobu to the foot of Mogan Mountain in Shou Village. It is 7.05 kilometers long. It was opened to traffic in mid-June of the 18th year. It takes two hours to reach Mogan Mountain from Hangzhou, which is much more convenient than before.</p>
<p>▲ Hangzhou-Ping Road. This road is the sixth road line of the road network, which is also a section of the Hangzhou-Shanghai Highway. The total length is 140.4 kilometers. From Hangzhou to Haining, in addition to the original commercial road, a new road was built from Yuanhua to Pinghu. Surveying began in June of the 17th year. Construction started in January of the 18th year. There are 50 bridges and 74 culverts. The estimated construction cost is 500,000 yuan. The roadbed has been completed long ago. The bridge project is also nearing completion. It will be opened to traffic soon.</p>
<p>▲ Hangzhou-Chang Road. This road is 130.6 and a half li long. The 71.6 kilometers from Hangzhou to Hualong Town has been opened to traffic by merchants. From Hualong Town to Yuyao, the Highway Bureau rushed to build it in the 18th year. The entire road will be completed soon. The date of opening to traffic is not far away.</p>
<p>▲ Shao-Ping Road. This road is 352 kilometers long from Shaoxing to the north bank of the Oujiang River in Yongjia. Last year, because the autumn harvest was poor in the area, the provincial government allocated 500,000 yuan to</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>subsidize work. It is under construction. As for the section from Yongjia to Pingyang and the Zhejiang border, the provincial government committee has also decided to expand the construction. All the roads are being surveyed.</p>
<p>▲ Yin-Zhen-Ci Road. This road is 61 and a half kilometers long. The total construction cost is estimated at 474,282 yuan, 6 jiao and 7 fen. The surveying has been completed long ago. It is currently under construction.</p>
<p>▲ Xiao-Chang Road. From Xiaoshan via Zhuji, Yiwu, Jinhua, Lanxi, Longyou, Qu County to Changshan. And Changyu Automobile Route, about 306.2 kilometers long. Because the Highway Bureau is rushing to build many roads, it is specially transferred to the Zhejiang Railway Engineering Bureau to build it on its behalf. It is limited to be completed within one year. The bureau has planned to complete the Xiao-Zhu section first, so that it can be opened to traffic in sections.</p>
<p>In summary, Zhejiang Province has completed a total of 818.9 kilometers of highways, of which 500 kilometers are provincial roads. The roads built in the 18th year of the Republic of China are 286.2 kilometers. The provincial highway bureau also recovered 89.1 kilometers from commercial companies. The commercial roads are 318.9 kilometers. Last year, the commercial roads built were only 42.2 kilometers. As of the 18th year, the highways under construction and surveying are 1,132.9 kilometers for provincial roads and 143.3 kilometers for commercial roads. This is the road achievement of Zhejiang Province since the 16th year of the Republic of China. The road administration is in full swing, which is beneficial to the transportation of Zhejiang and facilitates the transportation of merchants. How can it be limited?</p>
