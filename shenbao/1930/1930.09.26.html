<p>（十三日星加坡通訊）由荷屬東印度重整旗鼓來助之出征歐美中華遠征足球隊十三日下午在惹蘭抺煞新球塲與本坡華僑聯隊作戰當初中華由祖國來助與本坡華僑聯隊曾有比賽結果獲勝一球其分數爲二比一堪爲旅行順利之點綴不幸再戰星洲聯隊時慘遭大敗竟獲三零比而歸惟該隊敗北後即率師轉戰荷屬東印度其過去情形頗爲順利此次再整旗鼓返助該會意欲再勝星華聯隊以震遠征之名而雪三比零之恥詎知天有不測風雲人有旦夕禍福結果慾望終成泡影天耶命耶吾初以爲中華隊前此能以二比一勝星洲華聯此次再整旗鼓作戰其成績必比較曩者更優不圖一場劇戰勝負未分以零比零而散然其中究爲中華隊球藝退步歟或星華聯隊球藝進步歟查中華隊未重整旗鼓之先能擊敗星華聯隊旣重整旗鼓之後不能獲勝華隊此爲屬該隊球藝有退無進之象星華聯隊球藝有進無退之徵不特此也當該隊前此與樂華隊交鋒時其隊員全體强壯手足完好結果能以二比一見敗而此次之戰該隊之隊員重要份子亞九君手部負傷臨病迎敵結果勝負未分分數以零比零前後相較可知其已由二比一失敗逹至和局而對方之中華則由二比一獲勝直退至和局不待智者亦可辨别誰隊球藝有進步者矣茲將是日之球戰略紀如下</p>
<p>球戰時日被雲掩氣候適宜但觀衆方面因處於賽馬日期又以中華在坡過去之聲名關係比前者較頗形减少是日球判員爲西人哲朋亨氏球戰時兩隊之隊員頗見平常上半場偒雙方殊無分數紀錄下半場開始接觸時兩隊各謀進取之心球藝大有可觀各方均有多次射球之機會但中華隊之守門員周賢言君與星洲華隊守門亞九君大顯身手「接球」與「止球」儼如生龍活虎出奇制勝又如中華隊之李怪足惠堂君雖有數次危急之射球但均被亞九阻止此種危急狀態對在場老練之球員固無足怪不過在場之觀衆爲其飽吃虚驚不少至星隊方面射球之機會亦有多次但被對方之周賢言君脫險總之是日之球賽亦可稱爲同胞之圑聚中華隊係由祖國而來誼屬同胞星華隊係屬僑居星洲之華僑其球賽無論如何實無成功之可計較不過中華此次僥倖初戰敗僑居之華僑再戰鬥和局苟與異隊比賽其成績或與此次相同者亦未可料願中華隊諸健兒此後與異隊比賽時應當努力奮鬥爲華僑爭光爲本隊爭榮企予望之</p>

<p>南洋的記者　柳</p>
<p>聰明的記者大概不大說話避免政治批評免得是非不得已說些風花雪月清凉古董南洋的記者難做因爲對付理智的人們說話容易對付感情的朋友說話困難文化落後的南洋人能知道看報已了不得了要想他以理智來分析事實如何可能呢—所以毎個記者智識份子勞動者都以生活去决定他的意志不是以意志决定生活的所以南洋的報紙普遍地帶着灰褐氣色可以當作社會寫眞</p>
<p>然而南洋的記者也有比國内容易的地方（一）文字不大講究只要能勉强寫出幾百字就算一篇文章内容通不通有意義無意義倒不是重要的所以好讀書不求甚解和不讀書而好求甚解的人都可以做南洋的記者（二）有相當法律保護在國内如果觸犯要人馬上身首異處或住監牢在南洋至多出境不過飯碗落地生命是同危險的然而也要看　魂有無比軀殻先死的</p>
<p>柳君自述南洋記者情形如此於星洲紀念刋按星洲日報在南洋最爲進化首出之報其自述容或有譧抑鞭策之處但由此可窺見南洋報界之情狀矣在新嘉坡日報無晨出者均在下午四時出報安南之報亦如此而檳城有晨報者其異也政府檢查多在下午須受查後始許出版但聞荷屬之律異於英屬荷屬則政府不先檢查可自由出版不過出版以後查出違法者加以懲罰</p>

<p>蕭信庵女士應聘赴南洋</p>
<p>孤身在船竟遭荷人污辱</p>
<p>種種經過令人髮指</p>
<p>荷屬僑胞憤慨萬狀</p>
<p>渣華輪船公司成立於一九零三年之九月十七日其時僅三隻船航行中日爪　間迄今增至十八艘毎月返往邑城上海間者四次往返泗水上海而繞行孟加錫（Macassa)者四次由西里伯斯（Celebesk</p>
<p>）繞婆羅洲(Borneo)而至香港者一次總計來往中國南洋之次數約在百二十次左右近五年來華僑之乘此船者毎年不下十二萬人該公司之命脈不啻操於華僑之手該公司應如何優禮華人乘客乃近日竟發生强姦南洋華僑學校新聘女敎員蕭信菴女士案言其經過令人髮指華僑處於重重壓迫之下雖極力爲本案作後援然力量恐有未逮深願外交當局及國内民衆一致援助庶可爲蕭女士鳴寃茲述此事之詳情如次</p>
<p>女敎員蕭信庵八月十四日　　由上海開行之芝巴德號（Tjibadak）有安汶島（Anbon）上華僑培德學校新聘敎員蕭信菴女士亦乘此船赴安汶島蕭蘇之宜興人前十年畢業於蘇省一女師年近三十尙未字人頗穏健而有談風培德學校慕其名數電促駕始允應聘安汶島在西里伯斯之東交通不便故添聘敎員頗難此次蕭女士毅然就道可見其關懷敎育之殷</p>
<p>船員迫姦弱女蕭以弱質伶仃獨乘二等艙對諸船上僱員客氣異常此本我禮敎國家之特色孰料爲歐西宵小所乘船員逼姦案發生於船抵孟加錫前一日即八月二十五日事也蕭女士被迫後即時將此中經過遍告同船僑胞冀獲援救</p>
<p>船醫斷係神經適船上有泗水隨習領事陶寅·中南公司總理向俠民·哲學名家劉景文均以此事奇離有傷人道向船長明白質問船長隨招船醫檢查而船醫乃囫圇斷診蕭女士患神經病蕭女士年雖三十猶係處女辦學七年極著勞績今船醫竟以神經病者名之則渣華公司之狼狽通奸昭然若揭陶寅抵泗水後即以此事語報館而記者運其風花雪月之筆大背事實三四日來蕭女士以此事有關國體特將經過詳情訴之友人公諸報端</p>

<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>（五）哈爾濱之初見</p>
<p>太陽從積雪的東山昇起車廂裏的乘客開始亂動的喧嚷我的心也隨着跳躍起來這長途的行旅的終點快要逹到了</p>
<p>「哈爾濱」車在這站上停下了全車的乘客們紛亂着下車</p>
<p>當我走出車廂最初感覺到的是北方的寒冷啊人們都穿着很厚的綿大裳高而大的皮領豎起頭上戴着皮帽一些俄國工人的脚上都穿着大而長的毛製的靴我仍舊是在南方的寒裝尤其是呢帽和没有皮的外套衣領所遮掩不著的兩隻耳朶在覺着分外的苦冷</p>
<p>在冷氣中顫戰了幾次雇了一輛汽車於是離開了車站向XX街美術專校馳去</p>
<p>本來我早就知道哈爾濱有道裏道外的分界道裏是特别區道外是濱江縣中東路貫穿在中間這所美術專校是在道外的</p>
<p>汽車在哈爾濱的街上馳行了四個鐘點才尋着這美術專校裏面　無人聲已經遷移嗎還是關門了我知道我是遭了不幸只得呌汽車夫把我送到一家旅館去</p>
<p>將行裝安定了以後我就往陌生的哈爾濱街上去亂走因爲不幸的事件遭遇得太多的原故對於不幸的際遇也弄得習慣了雖然在陌生的塞北我没有一個友人或親戚如今孤獨地來到了是呀前面正潛伏着多少流落的危險但在我毫没有恐懼到這些</p>
<p>哦在熱閙的馬路上跌交眞是太難爲情而且太危險了可是我跌了兩次呢馬路上的積雪凍凝了如果不習慣跳滑步舞或溜冰的人走路眞太不容易呀</p>
<p>在哈爾濱的道裏完全歐化了並且在路上很難碰見中國人我在這陌生的街上獨行充分的感覺到異族氣氛的壓迫聽人們說哈爾濱是東方的聖彼得堡呢</p>
<p>這樣度過了三天老丁來了他第一句話就是責我爲什麽住這們大的旅館但我是不知道我是被汽車夫帶來的呀從旅館裏把我贖出去了老丁說</p>
<p>「我眞没有想到你會來呀」</p>
<p>「你呌我來的呀但是美術專校爲什麽没有了」</p>
<p>「可是藝術學院在等着你呢」</p>

<p>— 又裴</p>
<p>時光匆忙的奔向前進决不曾稍稍的停留瑟瑟的金風驅走了烈日炎暑換來了一番巧雲明月表示出秋天到了這就是告訴我們暑假已經過去應該收拾書籍重温舊業所以近月來各學校招生忙註册忙忙的晨昏顚倒尤其是滬西興新的大夏該校的歷史和發展已經本欄及各報詳細的登載茲不贅言該校本學期學生增加七百餘人新校舍亦告落成并已於九月十一日遷移在從前該校的歐校長元壞曾經說過「日出而作午夜不息夢魂縈繞而不能自安」這固然是當艱難困苦的時候歐校長流露出的幾句任勞任怨的話但是直到現在校務是一日千里的發展事務是一天天的繁多而該校師生富有奮鬥犧牲合作建設的精神他們爲保守過去光榮的歷史起見還是像歐校長所說的繼續努力着例如這次新生入學招待事宜即由學生會會同校務議會推聘同學中熱心校務者如楊紹志·王健民徐則驤·趙一雪諸君担任數日來幾位招待委員雖然犧牲光隂和精神但是在數百新生方面免去許多人地生疏的痛苦這種代價亦非淺鮮其事雖微而該校互助精亦可略見一班現聞該校十七日已將註册手續辦理完竣十八日正式上課敎授方面如黄敬思·董任堅諸位博士等均係國内外知名之士著作經騐均極豐富同學等亦均表示滿意但是最值得我們注意的就是該校校長最近發表了今後大夏進展的方針其中總括起來他說「今後進展的方針在物質建設方面我覺得一個大學最底限度的建築除課堂宿舍之外要有獨立建築物做科學圖書館并且我們切望大夏在三五年内完成科學館和圖書館的建築這幾年内須積極添購圖書儀器一俟最底限度建築和設備逹到後就要做五百萬元的基金籌集使學校基礎穏固至於心理建設更是學校重心問題今後吾校的心理建設可分作三點第一是健全人格的陶冶第二是眞知實學的修養第三是領袖人材的鑒别和培植」（見大夏六周紀念刋）在這暮氣沉沉積弊重重的今日社會大夏能不受薰染而且渙然一新已非易事而學校當局更以物質建設心理建設來昭示同學實在是特具敎育者的熱誠云</p>

<p>— 楊紹志</p>
<p>吳光韶著　北新書局發行</p>
<p>戰爭是要犧牲許多的生命和物質戰爭確乎是值得咀咒的然而眼見着中華民族遭受着多量的苦難苦難支配了全中華民族在這種殘喘一息的景况之下我們還是情願安於苟且還是情願奮鬥一時求永久的生存倘使在千鈞一髮的危殆時期中還要顧着苟且一時而且說戰爭是罪惡我覺得這眞是眞正的自掘墳墓所以說戰爭固然是不很好的事情但是爲民族底求生存爲民族獨立自由底一切對内對外的戰爭無論是犧牲得如何底巨大我覺得仍是需要的權其兩者的輕重自然不得不犧牲若干的生命和物質以求民族自由獨立底永久勝利</p>
<p>而最近文藝上各國人民因爲歐戰的結果對於戰爭的疲乏在文藝上也就起着這種反應竭力地主張非戰然而我們詳細地分晰這種主張非戰論調的核心是怎樣帝國主義者所說的非戰他就免不了自已以爲是高貴的地位總算是他的發些慈悲心來說句非戰算是恩賜一般的弱小民族其實這就是蔑視弱小民族的眞面目倘使弱小民族也說應當非戰這又簡直是自掘墳墓直接來表示自已的懦弱間接也就是向帝國主義者乞憐並且這簡直是一種夢想我們要我們自已的民族的永久地生存於宇宙之問唯一的出路我們就應該自已健全起來準備爲民族的獨立與自由而戰爭纔能有永久生存的可能所以是時紀述道種可泣可歌可興可嘆的戰痕的文字就有　揚的價值的</p>
<p>馬遣痕就是　樣的一部創作他用文藝的力量描寫出國民革命軍進展的事蹟他想用文藝的力量表現出爲民族而犧牲的光榮使它們永永地刻劃在一般民衆的心理永永地灌注在一般民衆的血裏使他們知這一種戰爭是應該紀念應該歌頌</p>
<p>本書中告訴我們說</p>
<p>「久在敵人負嵎頑抗之下的臨城在這怱急的一瞥中還不見有獸蹄蹂躪的痕跡稀少的人烟多半是茅屋隨處顯示着蕭條零落的景象」</p>
<p>再看在「刦後」一篇中伶兒家裏被軍閥的餘孽打敗仗下來掠刦害民的情形是都麽凄痛喲</p>
<p>彷彿兩隻狼拖着羔羊似的把伶兒的媽媽從床底下拖了出來她盡力的掙扎盡力的呼喊終歸無效終歸仰臥在一個穿灰衣的下面了另外一個用手帕堵住她的嘴用綳腿布縛住她的手被屈服的她一雙脚還拚命的踢那隻狠毒的狼隨手拔出一把亮晃晃的刺刀在她的一隻腿上狠命的戳了一刀她終歸不能抵抗了大約過了一點鐘的光景他俩極得意的提着包裏走了」</p>
<p>我們知道在這種痛心疾目的狀態慘遭着軍閥强蠻的蹂躪之下我們是否應當爲民衆努力我們還能忍耐嗎還能倫安於一時嗎我們自然祇好奮不顧身豎起光明的旗識勇敢直前地去掃除軍閥這種爲民衆除大害的戰爭爲民族求生存的戰爭自然是需要的在文藝上自然也值得紀錄宣掦的</p>
<p>本書共有十篇創作爲「亞麗」·「綁票」·「流落」·「證章」·「刦後」·「皮帶」·「出征」·「廻師」·「再鼓」·「謁嶽」諸篇「出征」·「廻師」·「再鼓」三篇是一貫的都是紀述作者參與前綫工作時所目睹的情形和感慨「亞麗」一篇是描寫一個有爲的青年出發參與火綫時的認識他知道爲民族奮鬥而死是光榮的他就樂於犧牲其他各篇可說是軍人生活的趣談以及民衆在軍事時期所遭受的苦難概狀</p>
<p>從「亞麗」的一篇中可看出作者的意志更顯露出有堅强的毅力更認清爲黨國而奮鬭的光榮</p>
<p>「好男兒鮮艶的血花消滅在男女的摟抱中何如移植在爲黨國而奮鬭的戰塲上啊」</p>
<p>這恐怕就是本書作者的正當意識所以去參加最前線工作的原因吧在這篇中他更攻訐宗法社會的舊禮敎是如何地刻切而精密喲看亞麗說的</p>
<p>「我知道我深切地知道名譽是虚僞的粉飾體面是矯情的堆砌我寗可做虚僞名敎的叛徒不願做眞實人生的罪人」</p>
<p>這是都麽勇敢奮激的言論她到底衝抉了禮敎的隄防得到人生最後的幸福</p>
<p>此外我讀完本書深深地使我難過的在「迴師」的一篇中有寫着這麽的一段</p>
<p>「零零星星撞見幾個同事他們又都慌忙向我探問同事的消息我從這些同事極沉痛極憤慨極仇恨的談話中曉得在濟南搗亂想破壞我們國民革命的原來是一羣野獸在那裏掠奪在那裏吃人在那裏無理性的猖狂」</p>
<p>讀者們我們還該記得吧兩年前的那個五月三日在濟南所發生的是怎樣的一回事新恥舊恨湧上心頭我們該深深地記住我們該大大地覺醒了</p>

<p>— 淑惠</p>
<p>金光楣著　時代青年第六期</p>
<p>文藝商品化在近年來的中國文壇上已成爲自然的慣習作者的逐一仿傚而不覺慚愧羞恥竭力模倣那班藉文發財的戀愛作家於是三角四角多角不等邊閙得一圑糟呼哥喚妹卿卿我我鬼鬼祟祟偷偷摸摸愈把性的事情多描寫些愈迎逢讀者的心理預定將必有銷路書店老闆也便樂意以鉅資來購買所以近年來的紅男緣女的作家層出不窮這種肉麻當有趣的東西作者高興做書店老闆願意買讀者歡喜讀但也被麻醉而不自覺了這類的作品和作家雖然還在繼續不斷地産生着可是在另一班自命爲時代的人物看起來却認爲是過去的産物時代的落伍者不應該再在那兒替布爾喬亞小布爾喬亞做喇叭玩哥兒小姐們的戀愛把戲於是喊窮呌餓呼口號貼標語式的文學又是一個滿坑滿谷大敲破鑼普羅文學是時髦的舶來品誰不愛時髦又是誰甘落伍連鬍鬚滿腮的老頭兒都會轉敲破鑼在這種形况下同樣的作者竭力做書店老闆願照担收讀者爭着看總之文藝商品化還是小事所影響於社會者無非是腐化和惡化</p>
<p>愛好文藝者大半是青年容易受感化者也就是青年青年是國家和民族的繼承者以這種腐化和惡化的思想灌注給青年將來怎堪設想中國文藝作品能夠排斥和糾正以往的一切差誤觀念積極的建樹一個中心思想使青年起來爲民族國家而奮鬥不致再徬徨走入崎途這樣的作品才是現在的需要</p>
<p>日昨送妹妹到上海進學校在報販處購得剛剛出版的「時代青年」第六期察其内容出人所料一張小小的刋物竟如此豐富除理論文字外最令我讀後難忘者當推金光楣君的小說「密誓」</p>
<p>「密誓」是描寫外國影片侮辱華人作者以最精悍的文字寫出深刻而動人的情景使讀者如身入其境恍若身處影戲院中看着銀幕上一幕一幕的侮辱中國人的情節不斷的在演映大概的情節是這樣一對非常闊氣的夫婦平日目空一切只知個人自已打算盤從不去想到有自已的民族後來看到外國影片上海辱中國人的種種不堪入目的醜怪情形他俩才稍稍感動銀幕上愈演愈起勁愈離奇他俩也便愈緊張愈窘迫因之也益形覺悟結果他俩受不住當塲空氣的壓迫終於逃出戲院回家後一夜懊喪未能睡着於是發奮暗中秘密立誓「從此願犧牲奮鬥獻身給我們的中華民族」</p>
<p>作者表示出民族的利害榮辱全體人民息息相關無分於貧賤智愚一部分人的恥辱也就是全民族的恥辱以促起民族意識的覺醒作者以最經濟手筆來包括廣泛的事實例如開首</p>
<p>「榮桂你把車子開回去等兩個鐘頭來接」</p>
<p>這是多麽經濟的寫法由這兩句看來便可以推測到張氏家裏是多少富麗因此便可斷定作者是善於描寫短篇小說的同時作者的想象力也非常豐富描寫銀幕上的情節是多麽周詳而不失煩屑作者描寫銀幕上中國人在外國不講禮貎不明衛生隨地便溺偏巧迎面就來了一位年青美貎的姑娘這姑娘當然惱怒憤恨而我們這位中國先生不但不覺惶愧且表示得意的勝利像這種寫法是何等深刻又如「那些高跟皮鞋的小姐們却一個個滑倒在中國人的痰裏」「滿手滿足都是中國人的痰」「寛袍大袖八圑花紋的長衣套方的補子紅頂花翎的孔帽掛着朝珠高底粉靴的紳士們酬應周旋卑躬曲折的神氣小脚三寸金蓮姑娘行路時的扶墻摸壁睡在雅片烟舖上伴着紳士們抽大烟的情景」「中國人的出喪開路神打路鬼獅鹿駝象功布亞字牌十二花神八仙人物萬民傘功名盒道士的笙笛和尙的磬尼姑的木魚鑼鼓旂號軍樂隊應有盡有」寫得眞是無微不至</p>
<p>作者對於文中主人翁心理的描寫也特别入微最緊張處是在銀幕上愈是光怪陸離的侮辱中國人時外國人看得愈開心吱吱格格地嗤笑而張氏夫婦愈相形見拙奇窘不堪面色時見發青發紅發灰大有不可終日之勢連賣糖果的BOY從他俩前面走過都無心思照顧只是心潮在不斷的起伏着</p>
<p>「雖然我有的是嬌艶的妻子高大的洋房豐富的衣食新的汽車體貼的僕人政治戲局一切都不顧問好在我的飯碗在租界我　的住址在租界我儘可幹我的銀行經理什麽國際地位次殖民地與我若何關係什麽民族被壓迫不被壓迫也與我不發生影響但如今呢這銀幕上使我覺悟了深深的覺悟了我看見我們的民族受人侮辱和欺凌迫害和譏諷」</p>
<p>本來是起先張先生自以爲矯矯不羣極端的個人主義此刻完全覺悟了雖然銀幕上所侮辱的並非是他自已而這種恥辱的到來自已竟不能置身事外他澈底明白了民族是有整個性的他當然是中華民族的一分子因之回去這一夜睡不着覺結果兩人决意秘密互誓</p>
<p>雖然這篇小說的材料不免受了洪深「不怕死」案的影響但是作者將那樣一件外人侮辱我數人的轟轟烈烈案子更進一步地描寫成小說使國人對之多一層的注意實在是難能可貴這才是把握着時代的作品哩像以往的革命過程中幾多值得記錄的事無奈就没有作家注意到這點而將它把握住何等可惜呵我願今後作客多多作些導人生的工作少寫些肉麻當有趣的東西</p>

<p>— 南心</p>
<p>三卷第六七期</p>
<p>在純文藝的小刋物中草野周刋是一朶最美麗的花這朶花無疑地是愈開愈惹起人們的愛好它底芬芳四溢於中華文藝園囿之中實際並不是和它底命名那樣成爲一叢荒蕪的「草野」了尤其值得我們可喜的是它無論在文字上思想上都有一貫的中心意識毎一首詩歌或是一篇散文其中滲入了極形豐富的民族主義的概念因爲毎個執筆者都有他底特具的風格所以我們讀了並不感覺着單調的意味這便是高超之所在最近該刋對於自已的戰陣更有所劃清在第六期上開首有一篇「致讀者」是以詩的形式寫的那種堅决地努力於民族主義文藝底態度委實值得欽佩現徵引一節於下</p>
<p>我們有不屈不撓的意志</p>
<p>我們有鐵石鑄成的頭顱</p>
<p>豈怕外來的離間與誹謗</p>
<p>更豈怕一切困難與挫折</p>
<p>將他們自已的集圑所有的態度赤裸裸地表現了他們是以整個的主義的集圑作表現的水準在無形中已滲進了正確的民族主義的中心意識而且無論努力於文藝或者其它學術除具了正確的中心思想之外還要有堅持到底的决心所謂外來的「暴風雨」當然毋須顧及祇要自已陣綫的嚴密與圑結即是增加無限前進的力量這些在這「致讀者」一詩裏已很明白地告訴我們了</p>
<p>在第七期裏有兩篇值得注意的文章一篇是毛明道作的詩命名「戰士墓前」愼重地歌頌起來眞是雄壯極了例如</p>
<p>墓前齊列着小小的木牌上邊寫着「某某爲中華民族犧牲底戰士之墓」經過這樣悠久的風雨</p>
<p>字跡飄打得一點也不模糊</p>
<p>不一點也不模糊</p>
<p>誰不記憶你們是爲國獻身的戰士</p>
<p>戰士們你們都是爲了中華民族爭自由的心切</p>
<p>方張起革命的爲民族而奮鬥的旗幟可知你們犧牲了性命</p>
<p>你們的精神是久遠不朽史蹟是萬古長留</p>
<p>現在呀你們的墓碑是巍巍然高豎還有許多愛祖國的兄弟已衝向</p>
<p>你們墓碑的前頭</p>
<p>在我們所謂次殖民地的中國的確有許許多多爲中華民族奮鬥而犧牲的戰士值得熱忱的紀念况且他們底偉大的精神與事蹟都可作一般有爲的後死者的模範鼓勇起豪放的毅力向前突進像這樣具有深遠意義的述事詩在目前中國的文壇是非常需要它的産生作者毛君居然能在這種史實裏尋找詩底材料而且情緒又異常熱烈與緊張詞句的豪放音調的雄壯都在這詩裏表現了出來最後的一節尤值得再三歌頌</p>
<p>聽吧前綫的歌音</p>
<p>聽吧馬上的軍笳</p>
<p>戰士們高擎着革命的旗旌向前進</p>
<p>燃起了爲民族爭光的火燄</p>
<p>衝過帝國主義堅守的巢窟</p>
<p>朋友們我們高唱罷</p>
<p>「中華民族勝利</p>
<p>戰士們高呼凱旋」</p>
<p>這裏旣有寫戰塲上的形形式式又有寫戰士們應負起的前進的使命最後加以希望着的所必然實現的有力的鼓勵以這樣複雜的内涵而圓活的表現於詩底形式裏是很不容易的其次要推荐到王鐵華的短論「戰士們認清我們的責任」一篇也可以說是不易多得的力作</p>
<p>作者態度很嚴重是以深刻的見解來判决中國所有的懲　現代青年們應迅速地負起重大的使命與及今後如何奮鬥的目標同時徵引世界各國爲「祖國而死」的許多忠實於民族主義文藝的史實作爲「戰士們認清我們的責任」的根據原來民族主義文藝的産生决不是空洞的不堅實的便能形成它自有歷史的背景與現實的環境在中國一民族主義文藝的深切的理論」已有堅實的基礎亦即這樣是必然地運生於文壇上了所以作者曾很透澈的說「這種偉大的工作的初端便是民族主義文藝的創立在紊亂的錯雜的青年思想上旣先下了一個痛砭更要給與彷徨在苦難時代裏的民衆以一個醒清的警覺實在講還是歷史的事實昭示我們要我們盡這個責任」這是不可否認的事實最末的一段作者是更有力的寫着「親愛的戰士們認清我們的偉大的責任吧偉大責任正是有史以來賦與我們肩上惟我們肩上負着五千年來中華民族榮光是挺出武器開始盡我們責任的時候了妖霧掃清兇惡滅盡一切助虐的工具剷掉這實在是爲民族奮鬥的戰士們當前的責任」像這篇尖銳的短論我們讀該刋的人應該深深地注意</p>

<h3 id="e1">Provisional Meeting of the Central Political Council <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Acting Premier of the Executive Yuan Appointed from Deputy Premier</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin Explains the Meaning of the Chairmanship</p>
<p>Nanjing, September 25th – After the Central Standing Committee meeting today, the Central Political Council held a provisional meeting attended by Hu Hanmin, Dai Chuanxian, Sun Ke, Lin Sen, Wang Chonghui, Gu Yingfen, Wu Jingheng, Shao Yuanchong, Zhu Peide, Song Ziwen, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Wang Zhengting, Liu Luyin, and others.  After discussing the arrangements for Tan Yankai's funeral, it was decided to hold a state funeral. The detailed procedures will be drafted by the funeral committee.  Because the existing state funeral regulations had many inappropriate aspects, it was decided to have Committee Member Dai Jitao revise them.  Next, the issue of who would act as Premier of the Executive Yuan was discussed. It was decided to follow the organizational law of the Executive Yuan, which states, "When the Premier is unable to perform his duties due to an accident, the Deputy Premier shall act in his place."  Finally, several financial proposals were approved, and the meeting adjourned. (Special Dispatch from September 25th)</p>
<p>Nanjing, September 25th – Today's provisional meeting of the Central Political Council in Nanjing did not discuss the candidates for President of the Executive Yuan and President of the Control Yuan. It is rumored that the decisions will be postponed until Chiang Kai-shek returns to Nanjing. (Special Dispatch from September 25th)</p>
<p>Nanjing, September 25th – Today's provisional meeting of the Central Political Council in Nanjing was chaired by Hu Hanmin. At the beginning of the meeting, Hu pointed out that the terms "Acting Chairman of the Political Conference" and "Acting Chairman of the National Government" had appeared in recent newspapers, which he considered inappropriate. He explained in detail as follows: Mr. Chiang Kai-shek was originally nominated as the Chairman of the Political Conference. When Mr. Chiang Kai-shek was absent from the Political Conference, a committee member was temporarily elected as chairman. Mr. Tan Yankai was elected more often.  There was no such thing as Mr. Tan Yankai acting as Chairman of the Political Conference.  At the same time, it must be clarified that recent newspapers have often confused the Chairman of the National Government with the Chairman of the State Council.  However, the Chairman of the National Government has the powers stipulated in the organizational law of the National Government, while the Chairman of the State Council only presides over the affairs of the State Council when it is in session. Therefore, when Mr. Chiang Kai-shek is not in Nanjing, Mr. Tan Yankai presides over each session of the State Council on his behalf, but Mr. Tan Yankai is not acting as Chairman of the National Government.  Committee Member Tan Yankai has never acted as Chairman of the National Government, and Mr. Chiang Kai-shek has never asked any committee member to act as Chairman of the National Government. The Chairman of the National Government is not just the chairman of the State Council but also has various specific functions for both domestic and foreign affairs. According to the organizational law of the National Government, "When the Chairman of the National Government is unable to perform his duties due to an accident, the Premier of the Executive Yuan shall act in his place." It can be seen that only when the Chairman is unable to perform his duties is the Premier of the Executive Yuan to act in his place. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek is still at the front and can still perform his duties as Chairman; there is no obstacle to his performing his duties. For example, in the United States, when the President leaves the White House, the Vice President immediately acts as President. This is not the case here. Now, even Party newspapers have gotten it wrong. This must be clarified. (Special Dispatch from September 25th)</p>
<p>Nanjing, September 25th – The Central Political Council decided today that the Chairman of the State Council will be rotated among the presidents of the various Yuan before Chiang Kai-shek returns to Nanjing, in order to emphasize government affairs. (Special Dispatch from September 25th)</p>

<p>The Transfer of the Coffin Scheduled After the Double Tenth Festival</p>
<p>Nanjing, September 25th – It has been decided that Tan Yankai's coffin will be buried in Nanjing. It is planned to survey a portion of the Linggu Temple area next to Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum as the burial site. The construction project will await detailed planning by the funeral committee. (Special Dispatch from September 25th)</p>
<p>Nanjing, September 25th – At Tan Yankai's residence, people from all walks of life continued to offer condolences and send wreaths. Dozens of condolence telegrams were received from party, government, and military leaders from various provinces and from various organizations. The transfer of the coffin is scheduled for after the Double Tenth Festival. Workers are currently being hired to coat the coffin with high-quality lacquer and apply magnetic ash. (Special Dispatch from September 24th)</p>
<p>Nanjing, September 25th – Tan Yankai's funeral committee began working in the First Park on the 24th. In the afternoon, the directors of the various organizations convened a general meeting in the library to discuss the allocation of personnel to each group, working hours, and all internal matters.</p>
<p>Xu, September 25th – Military leaders at the front in Xuzhou and people from all sectors of Xuzhou sent telegrams of condolence regarding Tan Yankai's death. (Special Dispatch from September 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Yu Xuezhong Arrives in Tianjin Yesterday <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Announces the Main Purpose of this Military Expedition</p>
<p>Tianjin, September 25th – Yu Xuezhong left Shanhaiguan by special train at 8:30 AM, passed through Zhouzhou at 11:00 AM, and arrived in Tangshan at 1:00 PM, where he got off the train to address the 54th Regiment. At 3:30 PM, he passed through Lutai by pilot train, and arrived in Tianjin at 4:30 PM. Mayor Cui, Director Gao, more than 20 representatives from business associations and more than 30 representatives from various trade associations came to the station to welcome him. Originally, Yu planned to go directly to Beiping, but Gao persuaded him to stay for refreshments. He got off the train and went to Gao's residence to rest. (Special Dispatch from September 25th)</p>
<p>Tianjin, September 25th – Yu Xuezhong rested in Tianjin overnight and is scheduled to go to Beiping by pilot train at 5:00 AM on the 26th. The pilot train left for Beiping at 7:00 PM on the 25th. Yu stated that the administrative organs would be taken over by personnel sent from the Northeast and that he would not interfere in politics. The Tianjin military organs will be taken over after the Second Army arrives in Tianjin. (Special Dispatch from September 25th)</p>
<p>Tianjin, September 25th – Yu Xuezhong's Chief of Staff, Chen Guanqun, met with a group of reporters and said that Commander Zhang Xueliang was deeply concerned about the suffering of the people in the Lu-Yu war zone and feared that Hebei Province would be drawn into the vortex. Therefore, he telegraphed, requesting peace and hoping that Hebei would restore order, get back on the political track and improve its international standing. In response to reporters' questions, Chen also said that Yu's temporary residence in Beiping would be in the defense area of the First Army, extending south to Baoding, west to Nankou, and east to Fengtai. The Second Army would extend south to Machang and north to Guofang. Whether there would be further expansion had not yet been determined. The amount of military funding subsidized by the central government had not yet been determined. Commander Zhang Xueliang had no definite date to go to Beiping. The Rehe Army would not move. The Third Army had not yet been formed. The Northeast Air Force would not enter the customs for the time being. The commander of the 23rd Brigade was still Yu concurrently, and rumors of someone else being appointed were inaccurate. The Second Army, the 2nd Brigade, and Ding Xichun's unit would depart from Xingcheng on the 26th and enter the customs. Yu will leave Tianjin on the night of the 24th and arrive in Beiping on the morning of the 26th. Yu also issued a declaration, the essence of which was that he hoped that all parties would have a thorough understanding, end the war, and work together to cultivate the nation's vitality and enhance its international standing. He himself was guilty of military affairs, and he also knew that patriotic comrades and predecessors would be a hundred times more devoted to the country than he was. (Special Dispatch from September 24th)</p>
<p>Tianjin, September 25th – Gao Jiyi, the Director of the Beining Bureau, originally planned to come to Tianjin in the same train as Yu Xuezhong, but Yu was delayed by some matter. Gao took the 102nd train and arrived on the night of the 24th. It is rumored that Gao had an important mission to negotiate. After arriving in Tianjin at 7:00 AM on the 25th, he was besieged by visitors, all asking Gao to find them a place. Those in office at various agencies asked him if they could hand over to someone. Job hunters asked him if they could take over a certain agency. Gao replied that he was only responsible for the transportation of the military and knew nothing about politics. The visitors left disappointed. (Special Dispatch from September 25th)</p>
<p>Beiping, September 25th – Yu Xuezhong wired Beiping, saying that he was permitted to arrive in Beiping from Tianjin at 8:00 AM tomorrow. (Special Dispatch from September 25th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e4">Resignation of Philippine Vice Governor Roosevelt <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The Philippines can be said to be a nation that, in the tide of movements for independence, always bounces back from setbacks. It began its movement early, it prepared well for independence, its self-governance capabilities and economic strength are also very substantial, and based on its historical position, it should have enjoyed the right to independence early. However, to this day, it has still not fulfilled its long-cherished wish. This is why the Filipinos are resentful and indignant. On the American side, it initially wanted to use its diplomatic skills to delay its policies, luring them with an independence plan that was nominally true but did not provide independence, in the hope of appeasing the people's hearts. Later, it saw that the policy was not effective and the Filipinos continued to fight. As a result, it changed its past lenient policies and adopted a stern approach, appointing a well-known opponent of independence, Mr. Roosevelt, as Vice Governor to suppress the discontent of the people on the Philippine islands. However, the more it suppresses, the more the people's discontent grows. On the day the appointment was made, the Filipinos gathered in large numbers in front of the statue of the independence hero Bonifacio, burning books as a demonstration. For a time, the heroic and desolate atmosphere spread throughout the country. Not only was the people's heart on the Philippine Islands not alleviated, but, on the contrary, the efforts of the independence movement were increased due to the opposition to Roosevelt. Seeing this situation, Roosevelt realized that pressure was not enough to calm the hearts of the Filipinos, and the US government also knew that the Philippine Island problem could not be solved by Roosevelt. This is what led to Roosevelt's resignation.</p>
<p>Therefore, the US government's approval of Roosevelt's resignation today cannot be said to be the first step in the victory of the Philippine independence movement. Although the future is uncertain and there are many difficulties ahead, the Indian nation is so willing to sacrifice and work hard in its movement, and its effectiveness has not yet been clearly demonstrated. Then, how much more should the Filipinos strive? On the other hand, since the British government's handling of India is so resolute, and the momentum of the Indian movement has not diminished and its attitude has not weakened, how much further should the US government be enlightened?</p>

<p>Wu Chaoshu Makes a Painful Speech</p>
<p>Geneva, 25th, National News Agency telegram: The League of Nations met today to discuss the election of new judges for the Permanent International Court of Justice in The Hague. As a result of the election, a total of fourteen candidates were elected, among which the Japanese representative received the most votes because of his great contribution to the League of Nations. Among the 52 voters, the Japanese representative obtained as many as 40 votes. Wang Chonghui, President of the Judicial Yuan of China, was also elected with 32 votes. At the same time, the League of Nations Budget Committee passed a resolution proposed by the representatives of the Netherlands and Norway, stipulating that from now on, the staff of the League of Nations Secretariat, the staff of the International Labor Bureau, and the staff of the Hague Court must take an international oath of allegiance to the League of Nations when they take office. The content of the oath will be drafted by the Legal Committee.</p>
<p>Geneva, 24th, Reuters telegram: Today, German representative Count Bernstorff spoke, expressing skepticism about the usefulness of the Disarmament Preparatory Committee, saying that this preparatory committee had not done anything in the past five years. Other speakers expressed similar opinions to the German representative. The British representative, Cecil, issued a warning, saying that it is not appropriate to hastily convene a disarmament conference without adequate preparation, and that the preparatory committee is not at a loss for ideas, but the exact date of the disarmament conference is still difficult to determine. The preparatory committee is currently planning to do something that no one has ever done before, that is, to limit the military equipment of various countries to meet the publicly agreed international standards. This matter cannot be accomplished in a short period of time. The Disarmament Preparatory Committee is scheduled to meet on November 3.</p>
<p>Geneva, 24th, National News Agency telegram: Various committees of the League of Nations Council continued to meet today.

In the past 15 years, India's opium production has decreased by one-tenth every year. Chinese representative Wu Chaoshu stated that China finds it very difficult to ban private opium smugglers because foreign leased territories are beyond the scope of its jurisdiction, which is very regrettable.</p>
<p>Another Pacific telegram on the 24th: The Political Committee continued to discuss the issue of ethnic minorities. Rapporteur Mota (Swiss representative) submitted a report listing all the points unanimously approved and the points of disagreement. The committee immediately adopted it.

<p>Strongest Opponent of Philippine Independence</p>
<p>Philippine People All Elated</p>
<p>Seen as a Sign of Victory</p>
<p>Washington, 24th, Associated Press telegram: According to today's news, Philippine Deputy Governor Roosevelt has already resigned. After receiving Roosevelt's resignation telegram, President Hoover appointed Roosevelt as the US Minister to Hungary. When Roosevelt was previously appointed as the Deputy Governor of the Philippines, the Philippine people strongly opposed it because Roosevelt regarded the Philippine people as inferior and unfit for independence in one of his books. The Philippine people believed that Roosevelt was too insulting, so as soon as the news of his appointment as the deputy governor of the island came out, public sentiment was indignant, fearing that the US government would use Roosevelt to reverse the policies of the former governors Stimson and Davis. Newspapers also criticized the government's move, saying that it was intended to abandon Davis and replace him with Roosevelt to change its policy toward the Philippines, and vigorously encouraged the Philippine people to rise up and retaliate. Therefore, the Philippine people were all elated by Roosevelt's resignation this time and regarded it as a sign of victory.</p>

Rushdi made an important statement to reporters, forcefully claiming that the friendship between Turkey and Russia is solid and cannot be changed by external forces, because it is not only based on political and economic interests, but also because the two nations have the same revolutionary ideas, that is, seeking peace, seeking national equality and rights, and opposing war. Rushdi will stay in the Russian capital for three days and then go to Leningrad. Russian newspapers predict that Rushdi's trip will conclude extremely important agreements to further strengthen and deepen the existing close relationship between the two countries.</p>

It is now expected that the remaining cabinet members of the Szkobe government will also resign en masse tomorrow morning. However, the officialdom has not yet verified this news. Vienna, 23rd, Pacific News: Prime Minister Szkobe recently told reporters from the Social Democratic newspaper that he and the Minister of Commerce are in agreement that if railway officials are forced to appoint, it is inconsistent with justice and not what should happen under a republican system. Today's Council of Ministers will reject the passage, and then decide what to do and decide at the same time. The origin of the current political upheaval in Austria is the dispute between the Social Democratic Party and the Heimwehr Party. Previously, when the Heimwehr Party wanted to preside over national politics, the Social Democratic Party used direct action to demand it. The current Prime Minister Szkobe then came out to mediate. This time, the dispute over the Railway Bureau is still the Heimwehr Party stirring up trouble.</p>

<p>The Leader of the Heimwehr Party Will Be Indicted</p>
<p>Leipzig, 24th, National News: The case of three German junior military officers accused of propagating for the National Socialist Party in the military and committing treason has now been verified. The prosecutor is now preparing an indictment that will accuse the leader of the National Socialist Party, Austrian Hitler, and the party's key figure, Dr. Goebbels, of preparing for treason. It is claimed that the indictment will be based on the fact that the two men have been increasingly buying over Republican army and navy personnel and civil servants. However, the party continues to argue in the Supreme Court that their actions are completely in accordance with the Constitution and that there is no intention to use methods that violate the Constitution. It was also stated in court today that the National Socialist Party is prepared to cooperate with the government as long as it can obtain the post of Army Chief of Staff and dissolve the Prussian Parliament so that the people of the state can have the opportunity to overthrow the Social Democratic Prime Minister Braun and the coalition cabinet. However, when questioned, the statement that the National Socialist Party is prepared to act in accordance with the Constitution is inconsistent with the party's political, economic and social program published during the election campaign.

<p>Jin's Army Retreats to Hebei</p>
<p>According to a communication from Xuzhou, the situation has changed dramatically after the Northeast Army dispatched troops. The battle situation on the Longhai Line has also taken a sharp turn. According to news from the front, Feng has issued a general retreat order to the troops on the Longping Line. One part is retreating west to Tongguan, and the other part is retreating north to Hebei. A few days ago, the left and right wings of the Central Army on the Longhai Line had already surrounded Lanfeng City Station. Today (23rd), according to the road authorities, the Central Army captured Lanfeng when the enemy troops withdrew. Qiu Wei, Director of the Transportation Office of the General Headquarters' train, telegraphed Zhu Longzhong, the leader of the First Team of the Engineering Brigade dispatched by the Ministry of Communications from Liuhe, urging him to go to the front as soon as possible to repair the electric wires. The telegram generally stated that Lanfeng has been captured and should be repaired as soon as possible to facilitate transportation. Zhu was originally stationed in Guide and came to Xuzhou yesterday on official business. After receiving Qiu's telegram, he has already rushed to the front. The Feng army is mostly retreating westward in the three places of Bian, Zheng, and Luo, while the Jin army has completely withdrawn to Hebei. The battle situation in Henan Province will end soon.

<p>Shanxi Troops Gradually Withdrawing</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The attitude of the Northeast, which the whole country is watching, has now been revealed, and the situation is taking a sharp turn for the worse. Zhang Xueliang's ingenious telegram arrived in Beijing and Tianjin at 6 p.m. that day. The military authorities of Yan and Feng were quite embarrassed on the surface by this result, because the telegram directly addressed the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and the National Government, which they had been praying for day and night.  Shanxi Troops Withdrawing from Tianjin</p>
<p>to express their attitude. Initially, it was planned not to publish the telegram, but late at night, the publication censorship office telegraphed all newspapers, saying that the Northeastern telegram was not prohibited from being published. The newspapers then tried their best to find the original text of the ingenious telegram. On that day, only the "New Morning" and "Ta Kung Pao" in Beijing and Tianjin obtained the original text first and kept it secret as a rare commodity. Other newspapers were very anxious, and some newspapers even offered a price of ten yuan to copy the original text. The importance attached to the telegram by all parties can be seen from this. The ingenious telegram was sent from the Shenyang Telegraph Bureau at 2 p.m. on the 18th. At the same time, Yu Xuezhong, the commander of the Yushui Railway Protection, also immediately ordered mobilization. The first unit to depart was the 27th Brigade of Liu Naichang, followed by the 33rd Brigade (i.e., the Ma Tingfu Brigade). The two brigades, with a total of twelve trains of soldiers, departed at 3 p.m. and arrived at stations such as Shimen and Anshan on the east bank of the river that night. Subsequent units departed on the 19th. As of 8 p.m. on the 19th, more than twenty trains of soldiers had gathered east of  Zhou and west of Qinhuangdao. The 4th train, which was supposed to depart from Shenyang for Beiping at 8:10 p.m. on the 18th, and the 8th train, which was supposed to depart from Shanhaiguan for Beiping at 5:30 a.m. on the 19th, both stopped selling tickets and were converted for military use. The 3rd and 7th trains, which were supposed to depart from Beiping from the 20th, were temporarily suspended due to a lack of vehicles. The mobilization of the Northeastern Army has been slow because, in order to avoid misunderstandings, it is planned to wait until the Shanxi troops have withdrawn before the Northeastern Army comes to fill the defense. Only a small number of Shanxi troops are stationed at stations such as Zhou, Guye, Kaiping, Tuozitou, Wuli, and Leizhuang, and they have already marched away on foot. The Northeastern Army is expected to arrive in Tangshan at noon on the 20th, in Tanggu in the evening, and in Tianjin on the morning of the 21st. However, there are still four regiments of Shanxi troops stationed between Tangshan and Tanggu, who cannot leave due to a lack of vehicles and have not received orders to leave. It has been found that the Shanxi troops on the Jinpu Railway began to withdraw ten days ago and are concentrated in the areas of Daming, Handan, Yuncheng, Cizhou, and Shijiazhuang. They will be completely withdrawn in three days. Feng Pengzhu, the commander of the 9th Army of the Shanxi side, took a special train to Dezhou at about 3 p.m. on the 19th to direct the retreat. The 101st train, which departed from Beiping at 8:20 p.m. on the 19th, was detained by the Shanxi troops when it passed Tangshan at 2:30 a.m. this morning (20th). It is feared that the transportation of troops between Beiping and Shenyang will be interrupted for a short time. In the past, five passenger trains ran between Beiping and Tianjin every day, but now it has been reduced to one. The Rehe Army also issued a mobilization order on the 19th. A battalion arrived in Tongzhou on the afternoon of the 20th to prepare to take over Beiping (Tongzhou is forty-five miles away from Beiping). Yuan Qingzeng, the commander of the Tianjin Garrison, suddenly fell ill, and the major affairs of the city are being handled by Mayor Cui Tingxian. Cui told reporters that he strongly supports Zhang Xueliang's ingenious telegram, saying that war and disasters only cause suffering to the people. Zhang's one word can transform peace and harmony, which is a blessing for the country and the people. When the Northeastern Army arrives in Tianjin, if they want to take over the municipal organs, he will respectfully hand them over and will never be reluctant. Before the Northeastern Army takes over the defense, the security of the city will be maintained by Zeng Yan'yi, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and there will be no accidents. All those with Shanxi colors are now showing signs of worry and are moving to the concessions. Since the 19th, bank runs have occurred at the Hebei Provincial Bank and the Shanxi Provincial Bank. The Hebei Bank issued approximately 150,000 yuan in fractional notes, and the Shanxi Bank issued a total of approximately 100,000 yuan in banknotes and fractional notes. Although there are no restrictions on redemption, merchants are taking the opportunity to profit by arbitrarily discounting notes from Taiyuan, which are no longer in circulation and have become almost worthless. In addition, there is one more thing to tell readers: After Xin Bosen took over the Tianjin Customs, the old customs officials, who have been in Tianjin for three months and still receive their salaries as before, are now preparing to return to the customs service after the Northeastern Army arrives in Tianjin, as the situation has changed. Also received news from the Transportation Community: The Shanxi troops between Zhou and Tangshan left this morning in a train of soldiers, heading to Xuanhua Prefecture on the Ping Sui Railway to temporarily garrison. Scattered small units of Shanxi troops are concentrating on foot in Fengrun, Lutai, and Tanggu. There are still about three battalions of Shanxi troops waiting for vehicles to retreat. At 9 a.m. this morning, Xu Congzhou, the chief of the General Affairs Department of the Beining Railway, spoke to Gao Jiyi, the director of the bureau, on a long-distance telephone call between Tianjin and Shenyang: (1) Please ask the Northeastern Army to cross the  River and advance quickly; (2) Please ask the director to come to Tianjin quickly; (3) The Shanxi troops are seizing vehicles very urgently, and all eastbound trains today are temporarily suspended. Because Beiping and Tianjin are the locations of embassies and consulates, five or six passenger trains are temporarily running between them every morning and evening to maintain transportation and avoid criticism from foreigners. Fearing that the Shanxi troops will forcibly detain vehicles, we have asked British and French soldiers to provide armed protection. There will definitely be a new phenomenon after the Northeastern Army arrives. (September 12)</p>

<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Since taking office, Qingdao Mayor Hu Ruoyu has paid great attention to local security. He recently ordered the Public Security Bureau to strictly guard against any negligence. As the winter defense is approaching, he specially discussed with Ling Xiao, the commander of the First Fleet of the Northeast, to reorganize the sea and land defense measures in Qingdao in order to prevent problems before they occur. It was decided that the navy would send warships to cooperate with the land police to be responsible for the coastal area and the Haixi District. The Public Security Bureau would be responsible for the Dongzhen, Sifang, Cangkou, and Licun areas in the city. The Marine Corps and the Security Team would be responsible for the area from Cangkou to Chengyang. After the above measures were agreed upon, the municipal government ordered the Public Security Bureau to order its subordinates to conduct thorough investigations of the household registration and check the inns to prevent criminals from hiding. More police officers should be sent to the docks and stations to carefully investigate. At the same time, a telegram was sent to Han Fuqu, the commander-in-chief of the First Army, to discuss defense issues. The original telegram roughly stated that the area east of Chengyang would still belong to the Northeast Marine Corps, but the area west of Ren Chengyang would be the responsibility of the First Army, and Han was requested to notify his subordinates not to carry weapons into Qingdao. Mayor Hu, because the defense of Qingdao has been reorganized, yesterday specially sent Cai Yuan, a member of the municipal government, on the Dalian Maru to Liaoning to meet Zhang Xueliang to report everything and ask for instructions.

<h3 id="e62">Guangzhou Municipal Government Protests the Results of the Shamian Passage Permit <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>French Consul Replies, Agreeing to Return the Embroidered Scarf Trade's Permit Fees</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The recent collection of passage permits for Chinese people in the French Concession of Shamian has aroused opposition from Cantonese merchants in general. The first to report it was the Embroidered Scarf Trade, appealing for its cancellation. Subsequently, various merchants who regularly traded with foreign firms in Shamian also rose up to fight for it. The Embroidered Scarf Trade submitted a petition to the Municipal Government some days ago, requesting it to lodge a protest. After receiving the petition, the Municipal Government summoned four representatives of the Embroidered Scarf Trade, including Liu, on the 16th to inquire about the whole situation and collect various pieces of evidence. After the representatives of the Embroidered Scarf Trade reported the situation, they submitted the collected permits that had been extorted to the Municipal Government. The Municipal Government then drafted a letter of protest the next day (the 17th) and submitted it to the French Consulate in Shamian. The original letter roughly stated: "According to the representatives of the Embroidered Scarf Trade, Liu Shaobo, Cen Shaoquan, Li Yuheng, etc. (the Embroidered Scarf Trade's petition to the Municipal Government has been seen in previous reports, so it will be omitted), it is found that there is no precedent for this passage permit in previous years. Now, the French Concession Public Works Bureau has suddenly set up this harsh example to treat the Chinese. It seems that they are only concerned with the goods of foreign firms that have entered the warehouse or have been separated from the Chinese merchants, which is discriminatory and runs counter to the aim of maintaining friendly relations between China and France. In view of the above, in addition to separately submitting a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government and the Guangdong Provincial Government for review, we hereby lodge a protest and attach a passage permit from the French Concession of Shamian. We hope that your consul will investigate and promptly cancel the aforementioned passage permit and return all the goods detained from the Chinese people. We also ask for a reply in order to maintain friendly relations." After this letter was delivered, the Municipal Government also sent Liang, the chief of the Third Section, to Shamian to negotiate with the French consul in person. At that time, the French consul also felt that the collection of passage permits from the Embroidered Scarf Trade was somewhat unreasonable and immediately agreed to order the French patrol house to return the passage permit fees collected from the Embroidered Scarf Trade, totaling HK$9. At the same time, he also drafted a letter in reply to the Municipal Government. The translated meaning of the letter, which was delivered at 5 p.m. on the 18th, roughly stated: "The collection of passage permit fees this time was due to a temporary misunderstanding. This consul also mentioned in a letter yesterday that the monthly tax of one yuan was decided by the Shamian French Concession at the administrative meeting in September 1929 for vendors, not for merchants delivering goods to Shamian. This consul is deeply grateful for the report from the Embroidered Scarf Trade this time. For the sake of fairness and impartiality, we are hereby returning the receipts sent yesterday, totaling nine sheets, and returning the collected HK$9 in full. Please forward them to the merchants concerned for verification and return a receipt to this office for verification. This consul has also ordered the French patrol house to only collect this tax from vendors in the future." Now, the Cantonese people generally believe that although the authorities of the French Concession have returned the permit fees paid by the Embroidered Scarf Trade, they still need to collect them from the hawkers, which is not a thorough cancellation. They hope that the authorities will send another letter to the French consul to abolish this example completely. (September 20)</p>
<h3 id="e63">Large Alliance of Songhua River Shipping Merchants <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Joint Development to Avoid Profit Competition</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The shipping industry on the Songhua, Heilongjiang, and Wusuli Rivers this year was very sluggish at the beginning of spring. Most of the regular liners lost money. The long-distance liners were still profitable at first, but recently, due to the large number of competitors and the mutual reduction of freight and ticket prices by the same industry, as well as the excessive number of ships opened, they have also become unprofitable. At present, there are more than sixty official ships of the Northeast Shipping Bureau, more than ten official ships of the Guangxin Official Bank, more than ten ships of the Dongxi Steamboat Account, and more than ten ships of the Fengtian Savings Society on the Songhua, Heilongjiang, and Wusuli Rivers. In addition, there are no less than one hundred ships operated by private individuals. The sailboats and small steamers are not included. Therefore, the total is more than four hundred ships. With so many ships, the competition for profits is becoming increasingly fierce, and the future of the shipping industry is quite worrying. Recently, the Shipping Association was reorganized and established to seek relief in order to avoid perishing together. Therefore, a general meeting was convened the day before yesterday. All the shipowners attended the meeting to discuss the results, and everyone agreed to the relief. It was decided that all Chinese merchant ships in the Songhua River should unite to form a large trust, with each ship as a share to jointly operate the business, and three major principles were established: (1) Freight rates will never be increased, but the prices will be unified; (2) Those who join the same industry will not have their personnel dismissed, but will be employed as appropriate; (3) The Shipowners' Congress will be in charge of everything and will not be subject to the control of any party. The business address will be in the Shipping Association, and no leaders will be appointed. The Shipowners' Congress will be the highest executive body. All ships that join the navigation will be subject to the association. The association will convene meetings to decide on matters and the chairman will make judgments. In addition to private individuals, the number of families that have joined includes Dongya, Guangxin, Fengtian Savings Society, Northeast Shipping Bureau, etc. There are still three or four families seeking opinions, and it is expected that they will also join. The general regulations and outline will be reviewed and approved as soon as Shen Honglie, the chairman of the Northeast Joint Shipping Bureau, arrives in Harbin. Shen has already sent a telegram saying that he will set off for Harbin in a few days. (September 20)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Investigation of the Zhalainuoer Coal Mine <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Approximately 210 Million Tons in Total</p>
<p>1 Million Yuan Needed to Restore It Next Year</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Few people know the details of the Zhalainuoer Coal Mine's coal reserves. The new deputy mine director, Ding, recently returned from an investigation of the mining area. I met with him and, according to what he said, the Zha Mine has 220 million tons of coal. If 400,000 tons are mined each year, it can be mined for at least 120 years. However, there are some places that are difficult to mine, so the actual amount that can be mined is about 60 to 70 million tons. Coal deposits have also been discovered at Dalai Lake, more than 100 miles away from the Zha Mine, and the amount that can be mined is still included. In addition, oil mines were discovered 20 miles away from the Zha Mine. Its abundant reserves are unmatched by other mines in the eastern provinces. The coal seam in the mining area has a boat-shaped vein that is extremely long, extending 30 miles east to the Alkhonde station and west to Manzhouli, entering Russian territory and connecting to the "Zabaikalsky Krai" coal vein. Other north-south directions also extend very long. The coal seam is very uniform, averaging three zhang. Once a pit is excavated, the coal comes out of the two walls like a wall. Open-pit mining is the easiest, because the most difficult thing to obtain in open-pit mining is a continuous coal seam. In Western documents, taking from one pit is called "masu," but the Zha Mine has no masu disease. Once a pit is opened, it can be taken inexhaustibly. The Zha Mine also has four characteristics: (1) Convenient transportation: The mining area is on both sides of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the railways north and south are all coalfields. The mined coal can be loaded and transported without any trouble. Even the Fushun Mine does not have this convenience; (2) Abundant reserves: Fushun can only be mined for 30 to 40 years at most. The reserves of the Zha Mine, according to what has already been discovered, are already greater; easy mining; the slope of the coal seam in the Zha Mine averages about 10 degrees, and its trend is extremely slow, making it easy for open-pit mining. The  everywhere you dig can be mined. This is not available in other mines; (4) No faults: The coal in the Zha Mine averages three zhang thick, continuously without faults. Unlike the Fushun Coal Mine, which has faults intertwined, often when mining, soil and rock are found and the coal disappears. The results of this investigation have been submitted to the railway bureau, requesting an allocation of 40,000 yuan to start small-scale mining. There are currently more than 100 workers in the mining area, working on a small scale, half for coal for their own use and half for relief. This matter has been agreed upon by all parties beforehand, and it is expected that it will not be rejected. To restore the entire work of the Zha Mine, 1 million yuan is needed. This is still  next year. In addition,  the matter of restoring the Zha Mine, due to the efforts of the Chinese side, is not as persistent as before. The restoration next year may be possible.

<p>Strict Investigation of the Case of Using Counterfeit Money: Since Zhu Pinxiang, the owner of Jixin Rice Shop outside the Shuixi Gate, used counterfeit Guangli Bank banknotes (some people had brought this banknote to the Rice Industry Association for sale some days ago, selling it for only four yuan per hundred yuan. Many rice shop colleagues bought it) to the villager Zhou Jingfu, the case was discovered.

<p>Letter from Jiangsu Primary and Secondary School Principals to Niu Yongjian</p>
<h3 id="e87">Three Key Requests to be Presented in Person by Representatives <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Forty Jiangsu primary and secondary school principals, including Wang Maozu and Xie Jizeng, based on the resolution of the Middle and Upper School Principals' Conference, sent a letter to Director Niu of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Expenditure Management Office, suggesting three points regarding provincial education expenditures and requesting their adoption. They also publicly appointed Zhang Tong, Tao Xuan, Hu Shuyi, and Ma Ketan as representatives to deliver the letter to Director Niu in person so that they could present everything face-to-face. The original letter is transcribed below for your consideration, Director Tisheng: With respect, your support for provincial education expenditures has always been greatly appreciated. The principals and others believe that the financial difficulties of various schools have had a significant impact on the future of education. In particular, at the meeting on the 20th of this month in Zhenjiang, it was unanimously agreed that there were three requests that had to be presented to you: 1. Please ask the Jiangsu Education Expenditure Committee to thoroughly investigate the accounts of the Expenditure Management Office over the years. It has been found that the Jiangsu Education Expenditure Management Office has never published a formal final account report. Funds have been transferred and borrowed in a confusing and unclear manner. To rectify the Jiangsu Provincial Education Expenditure, the Jiangsu Expenditure Committee should be asked to thoroughly investigate all accounts of the Expenditure Management Office over the years to ensure accuracy and prevent abuse. 2. Please ask the Jiangsu Education Expenditure Committee to reorganize the Expenditure Management Office as soon as possible and relocate it to Zhenjiang. It has been found that the Jiangsu Education Expenditure Management Office is an institution affiliated with the province, and the collection and remittance of funds are closely related to the province. Zhenjiang is the location of the provincial capital, and the Expenditure Management Office should be located in Zhenjiang. Contacting various matters would also be more convenient. For the sake of convenience in collecting and remitting funds and contacting matters, the Jiangsu Education Expenditure Committee should be asked to reorganize the Expenditure Management Office as soon as possible and relocate it to Zhenjiang to facilitate convenience and conform to circumstances. 3. Request that the Expenditure Management Office release funds as soon as possible. It has been found that all provincial primary and secondary schools have been in session for many days, and there is still no definite news about the funds for July and August. At the beginning of the semester, the schools are burdened with debts from the previous semester, and the new semester is burdened with even more debts. Repairs and purchases all require funds, and the most urgent need is for the salaries of teachers and the expenses of normal school students. It is difficult for a skilled woman to cook without rice. This year, all counties in Jiangsu Province have had a good harvest, and the collection of education funds and taxes should not be difficult. The Expenditure Management Office should be asked to clear the funds for July and August before the end of September, and to release the funds for September before the middle of October to alleviate the immediate crisis and meet the needs. The above points are all crucial plans, and it is hoped that they will be adopted.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Labor University Held School Affairs Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Resolution to Publish a Declaration and Prepare a Farewell Party</p>
<p>The National Labor University held a school affairs meeting in the school's conference room yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. The meeting was attended by deans, department heads, professor representatives, and attending commissioners, totaling more than 30 people. Chairman Cheng Ganyun opened the meeting as scheduled. Liu Songgu, the representative of the president, reported that the school has been in difficult struggles for the past three years. The former president has not easily given up his responsibility because the budding labor education and the studies of more than a thousand poor young students may be shaken due to personal relationships. Now that the National Government has decided that university education should be handled by professionals, it should be followed in resignation. After this, it is only hoped that colleagues in the school will follow the spirit of struggle in the past and work hard to develop labor education. President Yi is also willing to use his qualifications as the founder to do his best to maintain the school. As for the financial issue, it is extremely difficult. President Yi is responsible for settling all matters handled during his tenure in order to maintain school affairs, and the salaries of teachers and staff for August and September will be issued immediately. After the report was completed, Professor Representatives Zhang Yousan, Yi Gengfu, Gong Xianming, Xiong Zirong, and others spoke successively, saying that President Yi had put in a lot of hard work in the three years of hard work at Labor University. Colleagues standing on the field of labor education should have a special expression to President Yi and should fight to the end to live up to the original intention of President Yi in founding this school. It was immediately resolved as follows: (1) Publish a declaration with the content: (A) Expressing admiration for President Yi's past achievements; (B) Hoping that the successor will have university education management experience, understand labor education, have the party's history and revolutionary spirit, and be able to inherit the old scale and expand it; (C) In the future, the school should continue to develop to meet the state's supreme intention of respecting labor education; (2) Hold a farewell party and designate Professor Gong Xianming and other five people as committee members to prepare for a memorial or memorial film and hold a farewell party and public banquet for the president and others on a regular basis; (3) Organize a temporary administrative committee to assist the school in carrying out school affairs before the new president arrives. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Chinese Expeditionary Football Team Re-Engages the Singapore Chinese United Team <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Draw with Zero to Zero, First Time Chinese Win Two to One</p>
<p>(Singapore Correspondence, 13th) The Chinese Expeditionary Football Team, reorganized from the Dutch East Indies to help, played against the local Chinese United Team at Jalan Besar New Stadium on the afternoon of the 13th. Initially, the Chinese team came from the motherland to help and had a match with the local Chinese United Team, resulting in a one-goal victory, with a score of two to one, considered a successful embellishment to their trip. Unfortunately, they suffered a crushing defeat in the rematch with the Singapore United Team, losing three-zero. However, after the defeat, the team immediately led its troops to the Dutch East Indies, where the situation went quite smoothly. This time, they reorganized their forces and returned to help the association, intending to defeat the Singapore Chinese United Team again to boost their expeditionary reputation and wipe out the shame of the three-zero loss. Who knew that heaven has unpredictable winds, and man has unforeseen misfortunes? In the end, their desire became an illusion. Is it fate? I initially thought that the Chinese team could win two to one against the Singapore Chinese United Team. This time, after reorganizing their forces, their performance would definitely be better than before. Unexpectedly, the outcome of a fierce battle was a draw with zero to zero. However, was it due to the decline in the Chinese team's skills or the improvement in the Singapore Chinese United Team's skills? It was found that before reorganizing their forces, the Chinese team could defeat the Singapore Chinese United Team. After reorganizing their forces, they could not win. This shows that the team's skills have declined rather than improved. The Singapore Chinese United Team's skills have improved rather than declined. Not only that, when the team previously clashed with the Lok Wah Team, their team members were all strong and in good condition, resulting in a two-to-one defeat. However, in this battle, the team's important member, Mr. Ah Kow, was injured in his hand and faced the enemy while ill, resulting in a draw. Comparing the scores of zero to zero before and after shows that they have gone from a two-to-one defeat to a draw, while the opposing Chinese team has retreated directly from a two-to-one victory to a draw. Even the intelligent can distinguish which team's skills have improved. The strategic record of the ball battle on that day is as follows:</p>
<p>The weather during the ball battle was suitable with cloud cover, but the number of spectators was smaller than before due to the horse racing date and the past reputation of the Chinese team in Singapore. The referee on that day was a Westerner, Mr. Che Pengheng. The team members of both teams appeared normal during the ball battle. There was no score recorded in the first half. At the beginning of the second half, both teams were eager to attack, and the ball skills were impressive. Both sides had many opportunities to shoot, but the Chinese team's goalkeeper, Mr. Zhou Xianyan, and the Singapore Chinese team's goalkeeper, Mr. Ah Kow, showed their skills, "catching the ball" and "stopping the ball" like lively dragons and tigers, achieving unexpected victories. Also, although Mr. Li Guai Zu Huitang of the Chinese team had several dangerous shots, they were all stopped by Ah Kow. This kind of critical situation is not surprising to experienced players on the field, but the spectators on the field were given many false alarms. The Singapore team also had many opportunities to shoot, but they were all cleared by the opponent's Zhou Xianyan. In short, the ball game on that day can also be called a gathering of compatriots. The Chinese team came from the motherland and is a compatriot. The Singapore Chinese team is a group of overseas Chinese residing in Singapore. No matter what the ball game is, there is no success to be calculated. However, the Chinese team was lucky to defeat the overseas Chinese residing in Singapore in the first battle, and then draw in the rematch. If they compete with a different team, the results may be the same as this time. It is hoped that the athletes of the Chinese team will work hard in future matches with different teams, win glory for the overseas Chinese, and win honor for the team.</p>

<p>A Preparation for Participating in Next Year's National Games</p>
<p>Held from December 24th to 28th This Year</p>
<p>The Department of Culture of Jinan University, Yunnan, and the British Overseas Chinese in recent years have gradually developed their education, and the promotion of sports has been quite vigorous. However, since there was no representative to participate in the National Games in Hangzhou this year, the overseas Chinese have been regretting it. Now, the Singaporean overseas Chinese businessmen Hu Wenhu and Hu Wenbao brothers attended and spoke at the opening ceremony of the local Overseas Chinese Volleyball Competition United Association, and suggested initiating the Malayan Overseas Chinese Sports Games and were willing to serve as the full-field prizes. Therefore, they sent a letter to the overseas Chinese and published it in the newspaper to solicit initiators. Groups who agreed to join responded enthusiastically. The first inaugural meeting was held at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce on May 24th, with 64 attendees. On May 31st, the second inaugural meeting was held, and the attendees were even more enthusiastic. The conference charter was passed, and Lin Jindian was elected as the director of the preparatory office, and Luo Chengde and Liu Bingsi were elected as the deputy directors. The meeting date was set from December 24th to 28th, and the location was in Singapore.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the City First Public Stadium Amateur Tennis Competition held a doubles match. In the morning, due to the rain the night before and the wet ground, the match could not be held. In the afternoon, there were two matches in the skill group: (1) Guo Qida and Lu Weisen defeated Yao Zhenquan and Yu Binqi with a score of six to two, six to two. (2) Tang Zhiming and Gong Zhenyi defeated He Chunhui and He Erkun with a score of six to one, seven to five. It was found that this match was also the key to the championship in the skill group. This is because these two teams and the Guo Qida and Lu Weisen team have all made continuous contributions, and only one defeat has formed a three-legged situation. The two He fought on the field yesterday, and they lacked composure and were often taken advantage of by the enemy, suffering a loss first. Although they exhausted the wonders of tactics in the second set, they failed to avenge their failure and break a leg. The decision of the male and female will depend entirely on the battle between Tang Gong and Guo Lu. The schedule for this afternoon and tomorrow morning is attached below.</p>

<h3 id="e109">The Filial Piety of Master Zeng Nongran <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Shanzi</p>
<p>My teacher, Master Zeng of Hengyang, has been renowned for his writing since his youth, and in recent twenty years for his calligraphy, and in his old age especially for his painting. Everyone who knows the master admires his writing, calligraphy, and painting. However, what the master has that is praiseworthy and exemplary lies outside of his writing, calligraphy, and painting. Therefore, Mr. Zu'an praised the master's portrait, saying: "His conduct can subdue an era, and his virtue nurtures himself. His learning is sufficient to pursue the three ancient times, and his transformation is not limited to people. Calligraphy and painting are merely his extracurricular activities." Mr. Zu'an treated Hengyang like an elder brother for thirty years and knew him most truly. Among the disciples, Shanzi and his younger brother Daqian were closest to the master, visiting frequently. After discussing painting, they would continue into the night. Every time they spoke, he would earnestly advise them on filial piety. Once, when mentioning the Boxer Rebellion in the year of Gengzi, he carried his mother, the Grand Matriarch, out of the capital wearing short clothes and walked thousands of miles. Upon arriving in Hangzhou, he was filled with excitement and then burst into tears. His innate filial piety can be seen in general. In the year of Guihai, Shanzi and his younger brother Daqian welcomed and supported him and were deeply appreciated, and he bestowed upon them a long couplet: "Madam Guan's family is rich in painting, white hair waving a brush, colorful clothes holding an inkstone; Grand Commandant Pan's ten thousand cups of silk and bamboo, palanquin warm in the sun, orchids in the breeze." Now that Mount Tai is about to collapse, stroking his beard and chasing after his beard, his spirit is uniquely mournful. Recalling his 67th birthday, he wrote a snow scene and inscribed a poem: "I have lived sixty-seven years, three months in one year become an orphan. Mother's weeping, children's laughter, I do not know the hardship of raising. Fifty-five years I have lived, at fourteen mother abandoned me, I did not expect to live to this day. Every year the family celebrates with wine, I alone secretly weep, looking up to heaven. In those years, the broken house where mother lived, father sick for years relying on mother's strength. Born in the ice and snow, drinking cold water as breakfast. The neighbor quickly brought ginger soup, swept away the snow to wash the child, a long sigh. I dare not recall the bitterness of my life, teaching scriptures under the knees, weaving under the moon. Unable to repay the kindness, I only pierce my heart, this life, this pain, how can it end? Clouds deep under South Mountain, only dreams connect morning and evening. Planning to enter South Mountain with a writing brush, in old age relying on mother's grave to cut thorns." He also sent a painting album to his second brother, Jiyin, with a postscript: "This album was made in the winter of Yichou, and there are also untiled frames. Now, suddenly four years have passed again. It is mounted and sent with a supplemental title to Shu Nan, who is forty years old this year. I still remember that when I was forty, it was the year of Gengzi. I carried my mother and took you flying from the Grand Canal to the south to escape the Boxer Rebellion. You were twelve years old, your brother was fourteen years old, and your younger brother was eight years old. Your mother died in Beijing in her early years, and the late Queen Mother, at sixty-nine, wept with you morning and evening. I, wearing short clothes with only one servant, went through a hundred hardships. Now it is still vivid as yesterday, and I did not realize I was sixty-eight and you were forty years old. I went out and immediately ordered you to live in Heng to guard the tombs of the ancestors and mothers. In this world, it is fortunate to seek not to starve. Be diligent and hard-working, keep your body loyal and your ambitions honest. Seek to be one step lower than others in everything, so you will have extra place for yourself." Shu Nan respectfully notes this in the twenty-second day of the fifth month of Wuchen, recording this as a training for tending the courtyard. A poem and a postscript, repeatedly savored, are merely a record of filial piety. From this, we can see that our master's filial piety, although innate, also stems from the Queen Mother's fostering of the orphaned heart. Now there are sons and grandsons, and grandsons have sons again. My generation of elder brothers are all talented in correcting the family. Those who come out late, such as the one who is a barrier, are also outstanding and intelligent. The family's reputation is not easy, and it is always necessary to take the master's heart as the heart (repay).</p>

<p>— Lanxi</p>
<p>President Tan of the Executive Yuan, a member of the National Government, has passed away. This is truly a deeply shocking event. The National Government has instructed the Ministry of Finance to allocate 10,000 yuan for funeral expenses, which shows the respect for the virtuous and the courtesy. At around 10:20 a.m. on September 23, a coffin was transported to the North Station by a certain funeral shop. The coffin was much larger than ordinary ones. It was unpainted, with a yellow and bright color, and was made of nanmu wood. Many people at the station crowded around to view it. When the coffin was lifted off the freight car and onto the station ground, we stroked the wood with our hands for a while. The material was excellent, smooth, and lovely, worth 3,000 taels of silver. After the coffin lid was opened, there were still several pieces of black carved nanmu boards, which were quite exquisite. Six or seven men carried the coffin, each with their eyes wide open and their teeth bared, indicating that they had exerted a lot of effort. The coffin was lifted onto the car and will be transported to Nanjing, where painting work will begin.</p>

<p>— Laborer</p>
<p>Not feeling easy living in Shanghai and suffering from long-term poverty, I was considering moving elsewhere. After being persuaded by my friends, I traveled to Ningbo and met Pan Ziye, a member of the Bank of China here. Observing his behavior, I felt even more respect for him. Therefore, I express this.</p>
<p>Pan Zi, named Yelu, is a native of Kunshan, Jiangsu. When he first arrived in Ningbo, he often relieved his loneliness by browsing books and newspapers. Because he was not good at foreign languages, he often suffered from not being able to read texts from other countries. When the Northern Expeditionary Army rose up and the southeast was settled, local labor unrest also arose. Pan initiated and organized a club and established a radio station to spread commercial information. His colleagues also enjoyed the pleasure of listening to it. It was truly a fast way to do two things at once. His colleagues hired Pan to be the manager. Since then, Pan has been immersed in research, often staying up past midnight, and his interest is strong. When the mechanical structure became clear, he then worked hard to specialize in Western languages, so that he could buy and read foreign works to learn from others. Soon, he was able to manufacture various broadcasting machines. Mr. Su Zugui, the director of the radio department of the Shanghai Asian American Company, was introduced to Mr. Pan by a friend and was surprised to find that he was a genius. Pan's skills were purely derived from his heart, which was not an easy thing. When Pan went to Shanghai on business, he would definitely go to Mr. Su's place to ask for advice, so that his learning became more and more refined. He is now recognized by the people of the county as a radio expert in Ningbo City. I saw Pan working on designs at his desk after work, and they were exquisitely beautiful. Someone who has not been well-educated could not possibly have achieved this. It is truly a strange thing.</p>

<p>After the end of the European War, Western material civilization suddenly went bankrupt, and human thought was deeply stimulated. As a result, Lao-Zhuang's learning in our country became quite popular in their land. The film, novel, and drama industries produced a large number of anti-war works. In terms of film, "Flowers in the Battlefield" and "Nightingale in the Battlefield" were the most famous, but they were mostly love romantic or legendary styles. Now, only "All Quiet on the Western Front" is unique, penetrating into the marrow and brain of mankind, and will never be forgotten. It completely depicts the cruelty and inhumanity of war and killing, showing the war situation nakedly to the reader, and there is much to be said about its good intentions.</p>
<p>A person cries bitterly as soon as they enter the world, and sobs when they die. Love and gold are taken away, and they suffer from diseases and beasts. On a grander scale, there is the conflict between nations and the strong preying on the weak. Natural selection is a common law. The killings in history have become an inevitable step. How much glory and happiness can mankind obtain? The desire for goods does not stop, and the killing of mankind has no limit. This is why Buddhism advocates passivity. There is a reason why humanity is increased. In addition to implying the origin of Buddhist thought, "All Quiet on the Western Front" also depicts the foolishness and hegemony of military nationalists and current governments that advocate only loving their own nations and cruelly harming mankind. It reveals everywhere that the so-called 20th-century civilization has not yet solved the biggest problem of mankind. The world's great scientists work tirelessly for years, and the result is the creation of a weapon for a part of them to kill their own kind. Scientists watching this film are enough to stamp their feet and regret their deaths. Great politicians, great scholars, and great thinkers watching this film will not lose their voices and sink into contemplation, citing it as a human shame. When the world's conventions are exhausted and seven things are seen, the release of this film is more beneficial than holding several international gatherings. The whole film depicts the scenes of artillery fire and rain. When they charged, counterattacked, fought hand-to-hand, and drank bullets to death, it was heartbreaking, and it made people suspect that mankind would never have such a cruel and violent act. In the film, there is a Paul, who was encouraged by a cruel teacher in his student days and joined the army with his classmates, and he personally killed the enemy. Later, he obtained a family photo of the enemy from his bag and looked at it for a long time, with tears in his voice. The audience was moved to tears. When he took leave to return home, he was saddened by the sight and could not restrain himself, almost regarding his mother and sister as people from another world, and his house as ruins. It is heart-wrenching to watch!</p>

<p>The Reporters of Southeast Asia — Liu</p>
<p>Smart reporters probably don't talk much, avoiding political criticism to avoid trouble. If they have to say something, it's about romance, coolness, and antiques. It's difficult to be a reporter in Southeast Asia because it's easy to talk to rational people, but difficult to talk to emotional friends. The culturally backward people of Southeast Asia are already amazing for knowing how to read newspapers. How is it possible to expect them to analyze facts rationally? — Therefore, every reporter, intellectual, and worker determines his will by his life, not by determining his life by his will. So, the newspapers of Southeast Asia generally carry a brownish-gray color and can be regarded as a social photograph.</p>
<p>However, reporters in Southeast Asia also have things that are easier than in the country: (1) They don't pay much attention to writing. As long as they can barely write a few hundred words, it counts as an article. Whether the content is logical or meaningful is not important. So, people who like to read without seeking thorough understanding and people who don't like to read but like to seek thorough understanding can both be reporters in Southeast Asia. (2) There is considerable legal protection. If you offend an important person in the country, you will immediately be beheaded or imprisoned. In Southeast Asia, you will at most be deported. However, your livelihood will be lost, and your life is in the same danger. However, it also depends on whether the [ghost] soul is stronger than the body that dies first.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu described the situation of reporters in Southeast Asia like this. According to the Commemorative Publication in Singapore, the Singapore Daily is the most advanced newspaper in Southeast Asia. His self-description may have some modesty and encouragement, but from this, one can get a glimpse of the situation of the Southeast Asian newspaper industry. In Singapore, newspapers do not come out in the morning. All newspapers come out at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. The newspapers in Annam are also like this, but there are morning newspapers in Penang, which is different. Government inspections are mostly in the afternoon and must be checked before they are allowed to be published. However, it is heard that the laws of the Dutch territories are different from those of the British territories. In the Dutch territories, the government does not inspect in advance and can be freely published. However, if something illegal is found after publication, it will be punished.</p>

<p>(3) Asakusa Park</p>
<p>Asakusa Park is located in the Asakusa district. Most of the land for Asakusa Park was formerly the site of Sensō-ji Temple. In the sixth year of the Meiji era (1873), it was incorporated as a park by decree of the Dajō-kan (Grand Council of State). Since the Edo period, it has been a famous place for common people to visit. Formerly, the central area was the Kannondō Hall, with the North Valley to the north and the East Valley to the east. The Nakamise shopping street to the south was also called South Valley. Therefore, the park can be divided into seven areas: The first area is the vicinity of the Kannondō Hall; the second area is the area in front of the Niōmon Gate and the Nakamise shopping street; the third area is the Denbō-in Temple; the fourth area is the planting area west of the Kannondō Hall and the area near the gourd-shaped pond; the fifth area is north of the Kannondō Hall; the sixth area is the area west and south of the large pond; and the seventh area is the first and second blocks on both sides of the Nakamise shopping street and the third block southwest of Benten-yama and the street. What is called the Kaminarimon Gate now only exists in name and the dilapidated foundation stones. In front of the Nakamise shopping street is a stone path leading directly to the Niōmon Gate. In front is the Kannondō Hall, surrounded by extremely beautiful large ginkgo trees. Re-entering the Niōmon Gate, to the right is the five-story pagoda and the scripture hall, which houses the original edition of the Great Treasury Sutra, cherished as a national treasure. To the south of the pagoda is a small hill, Benten-yama, with a bell and drum tower built on it. On the bell are miscellaneous poems about Asakusa and Ueno. Below the hill is a pond and a children's playground. To the east of the Kannondō Hall is a gate called Nitenmon Gate, and to the north of it is the Sansha Shrine, with Kannon and Asakusa Shrine located there. To the west of the Kannondō Hall is the Awashima-dō pond. Since the Kamakura period, the stone lanterns of the six Jizō bodhisattvas have been passed down, and incense smoke has never ceased to this day. Behind the Kannondō Hall is a large open space with a large dragon god fountain, and the remaining water flows into the Awashima pond, then flows west through the planted area into the gourd-shaped pond. The stream is called the Ninety-Nine River. To the west of Awashima-dō are planted cherry, plum, and maple trees, and there are many old trees that have been there for many years. From here, planted with flowers and trees, a path for strolling leads directly into the woods near the gourd-shaped pond. The landscape is excellent, with highs and lows of the terrain, stone arrangements, forests, and springs. The ponds in the sixth district are all buried and marked in the rice fields. In the pond, there is a island called Omoteshū, and a figure-eight bridge makes it easy to cross. To the west and south of the large pond are designated areas for selling goods, as well as movie theaters and other halls, restaurants, etc., arranged in a row. The road is paved with stones, which is a new look compared to the past, and it is truly a place of joy for the people of the city. To the southwest of the Kannondō Temple is the garden of Denbō-in Temple, said to be the work of Kobori Enshū, with a natural style. National treasure forests and springs, and other halls and various scenic spots in the park, many restaurants, game fields, and entertainment businesses, but the garden area is only about 20,000 tsubo. The famous Fujiwara Hokō has written a poem as follows: The traces of the past are recorded as prosperity, and once passed life in the sea of vows. Also, as a poet, he appears in a white robe as an immortal, with white cherry blossoms.</p>
<p>(4) Inokashira Park</p>
<p>Inokashira Park is located between Musashino Village and Mitaka Village in Kita-Tama County, Tokyo Prefecture. It used to be an imperial forest. In the third year of the Taisho era (1914), it was donated to Tokyo City as a park. It was opened in May of the sixth year of the Taisho era (1917), about five chō south of Kichijōji Station on the Chūō Line. The terrain can be divided into two parts. West of the main gate is a plateau, belonging to Musashino Village, called Goten, with forests of cypress, oak, and thorns. To the west is the Tokyo Municipal Nursery Institute, the Juvenile Reformatory, and the Inokashira School, etc. To the southwest is Koganei Tamagawa, etc. To the east of the main gate is a low-lying area, commonly known as Yato, and below it is the Y-shaped Inokashira Pond, belonging to Mitaka Village. The pond is the source of the old Kanda River, and the water is clear and gurgling. The clear and transparent water allows you to see the fish and beautiful aquatic plants at the bottom, and the aquatic birds, fish, and plants are quite valuable for academic research. Next to the pond is the Benten Shrine, surrounded by a dense forest of tall old cedar trees, which is dark even during the day. Its shadow is often immersed in the water, which is also a magnificent sight. At the eastern end, near the water gate, there is a large open space. In the tenth year of the Taisho era (1921), this was used as a children's garden with a wading pond and a 60-meter swimming pool, which is very lively in the summer. There is an island in the pond with bridges on the left and right for easy crossing. There is a path along the pond for strolling, scattered with benches for visitors to sit and rest, and there are tea sellers. This can be called a natural forest park in the suburbs, a place for urbanites to relax. In spring there are flowers, in summer it's cool, and in autumn there are red leaves. On Sundays and holidays, there are various kinds of lively events.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the 25th, the gold market continued its upward trend, showing swift and orderly progress, turning mediocrity into excellence. However, the total turnover for the one-two gold bar was only 6.5 taels throughout the day, showing a softening of sentiment. As for bills of exchange, they also tended to tighten, with the listed price already reduced by half a level. Trading in the market was quite active, with demand generally exceeding supply. Companies such as Yuan Maoyong, Yuan Chengyong, Han Heng, etc., were all buying, while Hengxing, Yixing, Shunli, etc., were all selling. In the morning, the situation was flat and soft, with a slight decrease in the silver market, which was not taken seriously. Later, buyers became active, and bills of exchange also rose frequently, soaring by four or five taels. However, there was a slight lull, and then the market broke out. Yongzhi, Fengyong, Yuan Xingyong, Yuan Chengyong, and Yong Fuchang all made purchases, while the Dalian group and others were still selling. At first, there was a slight softening, fearing that the silver market might rise, but then the buying enthusiasm increased, and bills of exchange became even more popular.

<p>Before the midday closing, the market went straight up. The opening price for November was slightly lower by 2 qian at 542.6 taels.

Later, Hengxing and the Dalian group and others sold off, and the trend of bills of exchange seemed to weaken. The Eastern Exchange Yiguo Bank's appetite was not smooth, so the gold price went downstream, only counting 45.23 taels after 11:30. After that, it slowed down slightly, with retail buyers chasing, but there was only a change of one tael. At noon, the closing price was 46 taels, again suppressed by a few qian, at around 45.5 taels. The listed price had been changed to 600 taels 006 qian.

The after-market opened at 44.9 taels, following the residual energy of the midday closing and rumors that foreign countries intended to rescue the low silver price. Therefore, sentiment faltered. Afterwards, Chunfa, Yongda, Decheng, and others rushed to buy, rising to 47.6 taels at 2:30, then retreating slightly to 6.23 taels. After 3 o'clock, it rose again because Hefeng and Maihang mutually made next month's US dollars at $40.0125. Maihang also absorbed 8 pence for January British gold. At 3:45, it was 7.34 taels, slightly less by 4 or 5 qian. After 4 o'clock, the market sentiment was particularly strong. Zhifeng, Yongchun, Fafayong, Yu Dayuan, Chengyong, etc., all chased purchases. Zhengjin bought next month's British gold at 7 pence 8125, and Huari and other banks mutually traded next month's US dollars at $40.00 1/16. As a result, the wind rose and the clouds surged, jumping 2 taels, reaching 49 taels. Suddenly, it was suppressed by a small amount, as retail investors and others sold. At 4:30, the closing price was 48.1 taels, an increase of 5.3 taels compared to the previous day. The maximum price for the day was 49 taels, and the minimum price was 42.5 taels, a difference of 6.5 taels. The spot red bars have already seen setbacks, adding about 25 or 6 taels.

<h3 id="e120">Yarn Market Morning Firm, Evening Reversal, Weak <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market was firm in the morning and fell in the afternoon, but the overall situation was still rising. The world cotton industry situation was still pessimistic, so the Chaozhou group's attitude was calm, and the amount of selling was always unchanged. However, most of it has already been painfully settled in these few days, so there has been such a drastic increase. The general floating accounts in the market have also been cleared. If there are no unexpected changes, the market will have a period of consolidation. However, the current situation still has residual wind. In general, the overall situation shows no active upward force. The current sales demand is still good, so the two manufacturers are tightening and still not letting go.</p>
<p>The People's Standard situation was still flat. At the opening of the People's Standard forward market, the market sentiment was still strong due to firm sentiment. All months rose by 1, 2, or 3 qian. However, the three-grade yarn was flat and fell. At the opening in the afternoon, the situation was still hard. It was heard that the current demand for 23s yarn was weaker, and there were fewer buyers in the market. Floating accounts were cleared, but bulls were still raising prices. As a result, each month fell by 48 qian to 1 tael 1 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 18,000 bales. Among the sellers, Gongtai sold 700 bales, Hengde 900 bales, Yuande 750 bales, Yiyu 800 bales, Yongfeng 750 bales, and the rest from 350 to 400 bales. Among the buyers, Dachangcheng bought 1,600 bales, Tianchang 750 bales, Yuda 800 bales, Tianlong 1,100 bales, Dafeng 700 bales, and the rest from 500 to 350 bales. The closing price of the People's Standard is recorded below.</p>

<p>Current demand has slightly weakened. Current yarn sales are still good, but less than the previous day. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 1,670 bales for the day. Among the same industry, 310 bales were taken in. The market was flat. Among the customer gangs, 235 bales were taken in to the mainland, 205 bales to Qingdao, 315 bales to Xuzhou, 490 bales to Sichuan, 80 bales to Shantou, 105 bales to Guangdong, and 170 bales to miscellaneous gangs.</p>

<p>The trend of American cotton is still weak and declining. However, the local cotton market is firm and rising, which is really due to the tightening and unwillingness to release by mainland merchants, and some purchases are being made to go long. Therefore, the market sentiment has hardened. However, the current cotton business has been cut off. Chinese and foreign factories have purchased huge amounts of Indian and American cotton, and the prices are quite cheap. In these few days, Chinese and foreign factories have purchased another 30,000-40,000 pieces of American and Indian cotton. The cotton market is currently being absorbed by bulls who are unwilling to release, and Indian cotton is continuously arriving in Shanghai. When various sources are crowded, there will be a very large change discovered. Therefore, Japanese merchants are selling a lot. The Chinese Standard was firm in the morning and weakened in the afternoon. The Chinese Standard forward market opened with flat market sentiment, and there was a special lack of trading parties in the market. There were not many sellers. Each month rose by 5 points. In the afternoon, it was heard that various factories had purchased huge amounts of Indian and American cotton, and the sentiment loosened. Each month fell by 5 points to 1 qian half. The total transaction volume for the day was 25,300 piculs. Among the sellers, Changji sold 2,400 piculs, Yichang 1,600 piculs, and the rest from 800 to 900 piculs. Among the buyers, Tongxing bought 2,000 piculs, Dachangcheng 1,900 piculs, Rongxing 1,700 piculs, Yuda 1,400 piculs, Shenchang 2,900 piculs, and the rest from 6-700 piculs.

<p>Local cotton is very quiet, and Indian cotton is selling well. Current cotton trading is quite clear, but the Indian cotton business has been purchased in huge quantities by various factories because the price is cheap. The source of Yao flower is 2,700 bales. The arrival of Tongzhou flower has been stockpiled due to lack of transactions, totaling 750 bales.</p>

<p>American cotton bulls are closing positions. Yesterday, the American cotton market was mixed due to the possibility of large-scale deliveries. Afterwards, it softened due to the weakness of Wall Street and the closing of positions by bulls. Futures rose and fell by 1-8 pounds. Spot prices fell by 10 pounds. The British cotton futures fell by 1 point. Spot prices fell by 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 10 points. The Indian cotton market was calm, and Japanese merchants bought slightly. Pingqieer and Bairoxi fell by 1 rupee. Aomla did not move. The original telegram is recorded below (24th telegram).</p>

<p>New Supplies Surge Daily, Sales Remain Quiet</p>
<p>Continuous Sharp Drops, New and Old Alike Dumped</p>
<p>In Zhabei, yesterday's inbound shipments from Luli Road were estimated at over forty, but market sales were sluggish. Buyers from all quarters, due to the rapid price decline, were generally inactive, while sellers were unusually eager to sell. Thus, new early rice saw another significant drop, with top-grade rice opening at sixteen yuan seventy-eight cents from a high of one yuan fifty cents, ordinary rice already around fifteen yuan, and medium-grade rice being heavily dumped at a price cut of about two yuan, opening at thirteen yuan seventy-eight cents. According to telegrams from Wuxi, the price of Wuxi early rice has returned to the eleven yuan mark, but there is still no good demand, so the Shanghai market is still difficult to stabilize. Although the arrival of Dongxin early rice is not significant, the downward trend is also sharp, falling by one yuan fifty cents to open at only fifteen yuan. Yangjian rice opened at a high of thirteen yuan, Dujian rice at thirteen yuan twenty cents, and lower grades down to twelve yuan or more, all down by about one yuan. Top-grade Kejian and Bujian rice are only between eleven yuan seventy-eight cents, with lower grades at ten yuan six cents, requiring a sharp price cut of one yuan to one yuan fifty cents. Such a decline is rare in recent years, with both early and late rice dropping by as much as five yuan this week.</p>
<p>In South Shanghai yesterday, over thirty boats arrived, and the entire street was watching. Due to the surge of new supplies and the subsequent sharp price drop of old broken rice, all remaining small stocks were being sold competitively. Therefore, transactions were moderate, with high-priced goods, such as Changbang rice, opening at twenty yuan, and lower grades following suit. New early rice dropped by one yuan, with top-grade rice at sixteen yuan, fragrant rice at sixteen yuan fifty cents, and Jiaobaijian, Yangjian, Dujian, and Kejian rice all being dumped by fifty cents to one yuan or more. Top-grade rice is around the thirteen yuan mark. The downward trend here is no less than in North Shanghai, and further declines may be necessary.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Flour Market Rises in Unison <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Wheat Reports Good News, Benchmark Gold Also Rises, Speculators Rush to Cover</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw improvement as telegrams reported good news for foreign wheat, rising by about fifty cents, and the benchmark gold market also showed strength. Therefore, various flour mills held intentions to raise sales prices. Although there were a few sell-offs in the morning and afternoon, the trading range was very tight, and demand from northern buyers seemed strong. As a result, many stopped selling, and speculators rushed to cover their short positions, leading to a surge in buying interest and a uniform rise in prices. At the close, compared to the previous day, September contracts were up by two cents two and a half mills, October and December up by one cent seven mills, November up by one cent two and a half mills, January up by one cent and a half, and February up by one cent.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Wheat Market is Flat, Futures are Firm <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Flour Rises, Slightly Firmer in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of wheat futures was slightly firm. Various mills had shown some interest in the near-term, but buyers from inland provinces, due to the sharp price decline of rice, were reluctant to increase their positions, only settling existing ones. Therefore, despite the firm reports from the foreign market, the various-month futures did not perform well. However, when the New York market opened and flour price news rose, market sentiment turned tight, and prices rose slightly, but trading was not very active. As a result, compared to the previous day, September and December contracts were up by two cents, October up by six cents, November up by five cents, and January and February up by four cents. Spot wheat: the mill of Li Pingshan quoted four taels and eight mace for Shandong white wheat, but no transaction occurred. Later, 2,000 bags of Suqian wheat were sold at four taels seven cents two fen.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Soybean and Sesame Markets are Both Dull <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Soybean Arrivals Surge, Yesterday the soybean market appeared soft due to continued weak news and a surge in arrivals. Both futures and spot prices were down by about half a cent. Buyers from the trade and locals were active in buying 1,000 bags of late Jiujiang soybeans at a price of five taels six mace; furthermore, 300 bags of black soybeans; 200 bags of early Huang soybeans from Hankou; 1,000 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan soybeans at a high price of five taels eight cents one fen; 1,500 bags of Hankou medicinal black soybeans at four taels one cent one fen, and the closing price for Dalian Standard December futures was five taels three fen, up four fen.</p>
<p>Sesame: Foreign firms were active. Yesterday, the amount of sesame arriving was not high and foreign firms were somewhat active, so the market conditions were flat. This year's harvest in Henan is quite good, so market conditions are not likely to improve easily. The opening price for Shashi white sesame was eight taels three cents and a half per bag, and Jiujiang milk sesame was seven taels seven cents and six fen for 400 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Sugar Market: 3,000 Bags of Spot Raw Sugar and White Sugar <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw reports from producing areas: the price of Cuban raw sugar remained at 1.125, the price for December in New York was 1.12, and the price for March next year was 1.23, showing no change compared to previous reports. May was at 1.31, down one cent. The price for Java raw sugar was 8.625, and the price for October futures was 8.375, and November futures was 8.125, also showing no changes compared to previous reports. Trading on the guild market remained quiet. Dutch sugar grade 24, raw sugar and white, was seven taels nine cents. New goods were eight taels five fen, but demand was weak. Finely ground white sugar was eight taels one cent, and even less demand. Market conditions showed a declining trend. Japanese sugar N mark was eight taels one cent, J mark was eight taels two cents, Meiji TM mark was seven taels, YTO mark was seven taels eight cents, YRO mark was seven taels six cents, Minghua YT mark was seven taels nine cents, and YP mark was eight taels one cent. The amount coming in and out were also scattered and market sentiment was weak. There were reports from the Hao Pan company that they were selling 3,000 bags of existing raw sugar and white at a price of seven taels nine cents. Although the goods are existing, the bag covers are still white, so they were quite popular. The Zhonghua factory announced that it was selling over a hundred bags of green sugar produced by the factory at a price of six taels. The sugar looked like winter sugar, green in color, bright yellow in hue, and relatively soft. At a time when other kinds of green sugar are scarce and the price is quite cheap, the market situation is quite popular.</p>

<p>Due to the surge in arrivals, the market price of longan previously dropped sharply, causing inconsistent price fluctuations and an unusually chaotic market. It is now reported that shipments from Quanzhou have been temporarily suspended, and arrivals from Zhangzhou and Xiamen are also not significant, so the market has started to show some improvement. The prices for Quanzhou-soaked top-grade longan have risen by one or two taels. It is reported that telegrams from Anxi and Quanzhou all report a rebound of two or three yuan. Due to this tightening, costs have increased significantly, so the trade guild convened a meeting the day before yesterday to discuss price increases. The agreed prices were as follows: top-grade at thirty-three taels, heaven-grade at twenty-three taels, Hong-grade at sixteen taels, outbound-grade at twelve taels, bald-grade at seventeen taels, top bald-grade at thirty taels, standard grade at twenty-one taels, soaked round grade at eleven taels, and bald grade 1 at twenty-four taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign silk market continued to be sluggish because European and American companies telegraphs for silk for the overseas market showed still no sign of turning around for the Shanghai market. The market was slow. Only Xinfu and others acquired twenty packs of Shanghai white factory silk and Samsung purchased twelve packs of coarse yellow silk. Prices were equally sluggish.</p>

<p>Bake Losses are Only 300 Jin, Only 30% of Expected Silkworm Production.</p>
<p>This Autumn's silkworm crops in the Nanjing markets and countryside were mostly improved breeds (commonly called "School Breeds") made by the Sericulture Department of Jinling University, due to the promotion of trial breeding by silk merchants. The silkworm crop initially was very good, but sudden changes in weather, cold rain, and continuous heavy rains during the hibernation period caused the silkworms to get sick and the harvest was extremely poor, with only 30% of the expected crop. The silkworm quality was best with the School Breeds, with bake losses of only 300 Jin.</p>

<p>Yesterday in Shanghai, foreign tea firms saw a slight movement in the sales of Wuyuan big firm tea for America, but because the market has been sluggish for a long time and only Jinlong Foreign Firm is buying, the market prices are four or five taels lower than before. There are still sales for high-grade Zhenmei Green Tea, but low-grade is increasingly sluggish. Other Needle Eyebrow and Beautiful Eyebrow teas do not have large-volume trades. Qi Ning Black Tea is in a terminal situation, so the Green Tea market is also very sluggish.</p>

<p>South Shanghai</p>
<p>Recently, the South Shanghai rice market has seen a surge in arrivals, with about 300 boats accumulating in the Huangpu River, estimated to hold about 27,000 dan of new early rice, white rice, and various kinds of late rice. Therefore, urban and rural trading has been extremely sluggish. Prices of new early rice and fragrant rice have fallen by one yuan, while Jiaobaijian and Dujian rice have fallen by 50 cents. Ocean Point, new Kejian is also weaker and has fallen by two-tenths or more.</p>

<p>For days boats have been accumulating, and rice shops watch small and are afraid to bring in too much, thus the sellers are stuck. Yesterday also sixty-seventy boats arrived and eastern and western new rice prices fell by a sharp one to two yuan so sales were stagnant. Kejian, Jiaobaijian, and Dujian prices fell by six to seven jiao, and the remainder all decreased by three to four jiao.</p>

<p>The takeover of Weihaiwei is scheduled for October 1st. Negotiations have been successfully completed by Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting and British Minister Lampson. The National Government issued an order on the 23rd, appointing Wang Jiazhen, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, as the Special Commissioner for the takeover of Weihaiwei, and Xu Zushan as the Administrative Commissioner of Weihaiwei. As the deadline is approaching, Wang and Xu are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today and depart north on the Fengtian Maru at 9:00 AM tomorrow to ensure the timely takeover and administration.

<p>Stating That One Word Can Revive a Nation, and All Sides Rely On You</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, telegraphed a reply to Zhang Xueliang yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>Extremely Urgent. Commander Zhang, Vice Commander of Shenyang, greetings. I have received your compassionate telegram. Your concern for the country and sympathy for the people are deeply felt. Since the rebellious forces started the unrest several months ago, the communist bandits have seized the opportunity internally, and Soviet Russia is watching for a chance to stir up trouble externally. The fathers and elders in the war zone of Hebei and Henan are suffering as refugees, and the people in the disaster-stricken areas of Shaanxi are burdened by excessive conscription. Yet they still refuse to lay down their arms and insist on their evil ways, hoping to cause more disasters and lead to great upheaval. If we look at the extent of the disaster, it will not only lead to the downfall of the nation and the extinction of the people. Anyone with blood and spirit should feel guilty. Moreover, in your lofty wisdom and profound insight, you have already expressed your grief. The National Government's clear order on the 23rd and the Commander-in-Chief's telegram fully demonstrate their sympathy for the people and their desire for peace. They praised your virtue and granted your request to devote yourself to the party and the country, and to promote peace. One word from you can revive the nation, and all sides rely on you. I hope you will expand your great ambitions and carry out your original intention, basing yourself on the central government's fair approach and striving to push Yan and Feng to step down, so as to secure the country on a firm foundation and consolidate the foundation of unity. This would be a great blessing for the nation. Xiong Shihui bowed with respect.</p>
<h3 id="e195">The Local Rice Market Plummets <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The Panic Period Has Passed</p>
<p>Processing and Sorting Are Underway</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai rice market began to implement public measures, evaluations, and supervised distribution by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in June, the rice market has gradually stabilized. Recently, new rice from various regions has flooded in, and the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province are also expected to have good harvests, leading to a further decline in prices. When the Dongxin Japonica rice first appeared, it was priced at 21 yuan, and the Xixin Japonica rice also reached 20.5 yuan. Because the supply of old Japonica rice was not connected to the arrival of new rice, and the new rice had not yet reached its peak, it was necessary to appropriately relax restrictions. Recently, the daily arrival of rice has been over 20,000 shi (bushels), and broken rice has almost disappeared. The current price of new top-grade Japonica rice is 15.8 to 17 yuan, which is four yuan less than five days ago. The price of Ke Xian rice is 11 to 11.8 yuan, which is 3.5 yuan less than five days ago. It is also heard that a large amount of rice is on its way, and the market price is expected to fall further. It is reported that the Bureau has not yet revoked the evaluation order for the sake of caution, but it is expected to do so soon. The Bureau is also in the process of sorting and editing the complex circumstances of this year's rice shortage, which will serve as a valuable reference. It is said that it will be published as soon as it is completed.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Hu Ruoyu Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Went to Nanjing with Li Shizeng Last Night</p>
<p>To Attend the Funeral of Director Tan, but Did Not Visit Chiang</p>
<p>Hu Ruoyu, the mayor of Qingdao, arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday on the Fengtian Maru from Qingdao. Li Shizeng and representatives from Finance Minister Song Ziwen, among others, welcomed him at the pier. He then went with Li to Li's private residence on Foch Road to rest. At 11:00 PM last night, Hu and Li took the night train to Nanjing. According to Hu, whom our reporter interviewed on the train, his trip to Nanjing was to attend Director Tan's funeral and report on the Qingdao municipal affairs to the National Government. He will return to Qingdao after a short stay. This trip is purely a personal matter and does not represent Director Zhang, so he will not visit General Chiang at the front line. The rumor that Zhang Xueming is the commander of the Qingdao garrison is absolutely untrue, because a garrison commander must have troops stationed there, and Zhang has no troops stationed in Qingdao, so this rumor is unfounded. As for the facilities of Qingdao's municipal administration, there are no new plans for the time being.</p>

<p>The Supervisory Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department sent a telegram of condolence to the Tan family yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>To the family of Committee Member Tan, transferred by the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, greetings. The sudden passing of Mr. Zu'an has sent shockwaves far and wide.

<h3 id="e198">The Municipal Public Security Bureau Orders the Expedited Creation of Household Registers <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>For the Purpose of Dividing Municipal Districts</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau received instructions from the Municipal Government yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>In order to comply with the order of the Executive Yuan to divide the municipal districts of this city, the committee has been organized and decided to conduct a survey and create registers in accordance with the original municipal districts. However, in the four districts of Hunan, Zhabei, Yinxiang, and Yangjing, where municipal committees have not been established, the Public Security Bureau should be responsible for creating household registers in preparation for the division and for formulating a register format to be uniformly created and submitted for review by October 4th. The matter of creating registers is complicated and the deadline is pressing. The Bureau hereby orders you, the station chiefs, to immediately send the household registration patrol officers to the Bureau to receive the registers and await instructions on the household registration procedures. At the same time, the station chiefs should select two clerical police officers in addition to the existing household registration officers and assistants to help with the creation of the registers. They must be completed and submitted to the Bureau by October 2nd, without delay, so as not to hinder the public interest. This order is urgent.</p>

<h3 id="e201">The Issue of Water Rate Increases <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>A Compilation of Correspondence</p>
<p>The following is a compilation of correspondence between the Chinese Ratepayers Association, the Real Estate Association, and the Water Company regarding the issue of water rate increases in the International Settlement:</p>
<p>Letter from the Ratepayers Association to the Public Works Department:</p>
<p>Sir, Regarding the water rate increase, our Association sent a letter on September 16th detailing two major reasons. We believe that you have already considered them. As for your department's reply of September 15th to our Association's first response, when compared with the two letters mentioned in our Association's second letter, the reasons for the rate increase are still difficult to establish. Your department should pay attention to this. Now, the Shanghai Water Company, perhaps at the suggestion of your department, has sent a letter to our Association and the Shanghai Real Estate Association requesting them to send representatives to audit the accounts. From a legal point of view, our Association believes that the water rate increase should be discussed after the audit results are reported. We hereby send this letter for your attention and to inform the Shanghai Water Company.</p>
<p>Letter from the Ratepayers Association to the Company:</p>
<p>Sir, We have received your letter of September 18th requesting our Association to send representatives to audit the accounts. We have learned that your company is a public utility and has requested relevant organizations to audit the accounts. This open attitude is a proper approach. Our Association is a representative organization of all residents in the Settlement, and we have an unshirkable duty to fulfill this responsibility. We hereby appoint Mr. Yu Xiji, a certified accountant and member of our Association, Mr. Pan Xulun, a certified accountant, and Mr. He Dekui, a Master of Commerce, as representatives to conduct the audit. We hereby send this letter for your attention. Furthermore, our Association believes that the issue of water rates should be discussed after the audit results are known. We hereby state this together.</p>
<p>Letter from the Company to the Real Estate Association:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Water Company to the Shanghai Real Estate Association, greetings: We have received your letter of the 23rd requesting the annual report and accounts of our company. We now enclose the business report for the past three years for your review. Our directors believe that the basis for this surcharge is the budget for the coming year. We previously requested your Association to select representatives to review this budget. The past accounts are not related to the current issue. Today's newspapers reported that the Chinese Ratepayers Association has selected three audit representatives. Our directors respectfully request your Association to select specialists to conduct the audit at the same time.</p>
<p>Reply from the Real Estate Association to the Company:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association replied to the Shanghai Water Company yesterday, stating: We have received your letter today enclosing the business report for the past three years. We are aware that your company's attitude is upright and in line with the behavior of a monopolistic public utility. However, your company said that the invited reviewers are only to review the budget based on future revenue and expenditure, and that the past business conditions are not within the scope of review. This is not the same from our Association's point of view. We believe that the future budget must be based on the past. Moreover, since this is the first time to review this economic situation, it is necessary to know its past history in order to be effective. Therefore, we still request your company to send the report of the business operations since its establishment to the Association for reference. As for sending representatives to conduct the audit, our Association believes that it is our natural and unshirkable duty. However, the Chinese Ratepayers Association is the general representative organization of all residents in the Settlement, and our Association has absolute respect for its words and deeds. For the sake of unity, we will not send representatives to conduct the audit this time. We will ask the audit representatives of the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association to do so. In theory, our Association believes that the issue of whether or not to increase the water rate should be discussed after the audit results are known. We have sent this letter for your reference.</p>
<p>Letter from the Real Estate Association to the Ratepayers Association:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association yesterday, stating: Regarding the Shanghai Water Company's request to send representatives to audit the accounts, our Association sent a letter to the company requesting the annual business report since its establishment. Later, we received only one copy of the company's report for the past three years. They also requested that the invited reviewers only review the outline based on future revenue and expenditure, and that the past business conditions were not within the scope of review. How can the company's attitude be known? Therefore, we again sent a letter to the company requesting the business report for reference. As for sending representatives to conduct the audit, although the company has repeatedly urged us to do so, our Association confirms that your Association is the general representative organization of all residents in the Settlement, and we have absolute respect for your Association's words and deeds. For the sake of unity, our Association will not send representatives. We respectfully ask Mr. Yu Xiji, Mr. He Dekui, and Mr. Pan Xulun to take the lead. In addition to informing the Shanghai Water Company for reference, we have also sent this letter for your reference and to extend our regards to the three representatives, Yu, He, and Pan.</p>
<h3 id="e202">The County Finance Bureau Urges the Collection of Land Tax <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County's Land Tax for the 19th year began collection on August 1st, with a deadline of two months. The Bureau Chief, Mr. Wang, has checked the amount of land tax collected and found that a large amount is still outstanding. The Provincial Treasury is urging the collection of funds, and the amount of Winter Tribute arrears for the 18th year paid by various businesses is also very small. Therefore, yesterday, the Bureau issued a separate list of the amount of land tax arrears in each district and sent them to the collection officials for urgent collection. They must all be paid in full within the month so that they can be submitted to the Provincial Treasury.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Special Transportation Contract Negotiations: China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Customs Brokers Association Reach Understanding <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Results of Discussions Between Customs Broker Representatives and the Company</p>
<p>After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) concluded special transportation contracts with Maoxin (茂新), Fuxin (福新), Shenxin (申新), and other factories in June of this year for flour and cotton yarn, the Customs Brokers Association (報關行同業) sent representatives to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to question whether this would hinder the business of customs brokers. Although the company explained, it did not gain their understanding. Recently, the Customs Brokers Association again sent a letter to the company requesting the maintenance of the rights of the industry and dispatched representatives You Senting (尤森庭) and Shi Zhikun (石芝坤) to the company for discussions. The company has made a sincere statement, and it is hoped that misunderstandings can be resolved. The details of this matter are recorded below:</p>
<p>Content of the Reply: Upon investigation, the practice of shipping companies directly entering into transportation contracts with customers is not new, nor did it originate with our company. For example, Qixin (啓新) Cement Factory, Jiuda (久大), Yijing (益精) Salt Factories in Tianjin, and companies such as the Asiatic Petroleum Company, Standard Oil Company of New York, British-American Tobacco Company in Shanghai, British Soap Company, Tongyutai (通豫泰) and Fuliang (福良) Companies in Jiujiang, and the Ningbo Cotton Industry Association have all entered into transportation contracts with shipping companies for many years. Furthermore, Maoxin, Fuxin, Shenxin, and other factories have also directly contracted with Taikoo (太古) (it is heard that Taikoo already handles the transport of their flour from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Guangdong). All the above-mentioned cases occurred before our company entered into contracts, and we have not heard your association express opposition. There may be some misunderstandings, and we hope for your understanding and consideration.</p>
<p>Representatives’ Discussions: You Senting, chairman of the customs brokers associations in various treaty ports, and Shi Zhikun, chairman of the customs brokers associations in the north and south of the city, visited the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company General Bureau yesterday at 3 PM to inquire about the contents of the contract. Shen Zhongyi (沈仲毅), head of the Business Section, met them, explained everything, and stated that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company entered into transportation contracts with various commercial firms to increase business. All companies have precedents, but the water transport rates set this time are not lower than market prices, so there is no hindrance to the business of customs brokers. The shipping company and the customs brokers association are interdependent, and there is no reason to abandon them. It can be guaranteed that the freight of each customs broker will be loaded first, etc. The two representatives expressed satisfaction and agreed to explain to all their colleagues.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Northeast Charity Representatives Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Rumor of Zhu Qinglan's Abduction is Inaccurate</p>
<p>The water disaster in Liaoning caused significant damage. Yang Zigong (楊子功), chairman of the charity associations of Fengtian, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and other provinces, came to Shanghai specifically for this purpose. Li Zushen (李組紳), vice-chairman of the North China Charity Federation, had conducted a detailed investigation of the disaster situation in the Northeast. This time, he accompanied his father's coffin back to his hometown of Zhenhai. After arriving in Shanghai on the same ship and completing the burial, he will also come to Shanghai to discuss relief efforts with Shanghai charitable organizations. It is reported that according to yesterday's telegram from Peiping (北平), the news that General Zhu Qinglan (朱慶瀾) was abducted is not accurate. Two people who were traveling with him were abducted. General Zhu is currently staying in Xi'an to rescue them, so he has not yet returned to Peiping.</p>
<h3 id="e205">News of the End of the War and the Progress of the Zhong-Longhai Joint Transportation <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Communications Orders Investigation into the Zhen Da Wharf Construction Case</p>
<p>Since the opening of Haizhou (海州) as a seaport, most of the goods from Longhai (隴海), Pingpu (平浦), and Pinghan (平漢) areas that used to be transported to Shanghai were loaded onto Yangtze River boats. Eight or nine out of ten were transferred from Xuzhou (徐州) to Pukou (浦口) and then loaded onto Yangtze River boats to Shanghai. The procedures were complicated, the transport was time-consuming, and the water transport rates were very high. After the waterway directly connecting Haizhou to Shanghai was opened, Longhai goods could be directly loaded onto ships in Haizhou. Therefore, the tobacco from Lanzhou (蘭州), Gansu (甘肅), which used to come to Shanghai by Yangtze River boats, is now transported from Haizhou to Shanghai. In recent years, due to the war, the transportation of goods from Longhai was blocked, and the shipping industry in Haizhou was severely affected. Now that the war is about to end, it is hoped that commercial transportation in Longhai can be restored. The recent situation of Haizhou shipping is recorded below: Currently operating in Haizhou: After the opening of Haizhou to navigation, the first company to start operations was the Japanese-owned International Steamship Company (國際從汽社), which sent two ships to run between Shanghai and Haizhou. There were even more Japanese ships traveling from Qingdao to Haizhou. Last year, after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly argued with the Japanese side that Haizhou was an inland area and not a treaty port, foreign ships could not navigate there, and the Japanese ships between Shanghai and Haizhou stopped. There are still three Japanese ships operating from Qingdao. There are more than a dozen Chinese merchant ships traveling to Haizhou from Shanghai, mostly transporting salt from Lianghuai (兩淮) to the Yangtze River. Because the salt from Huai does not need to be weighed when transported to Shanghai, the maximum number of carriers is formal liners. Initially, there was only one ship, "Tonghua (同華)," from China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. This year, the Da Zhen Company (大振公司) was established and specially opened two regular Shanghai-Haizhou ships.</p>
<p>Longhai Joint Transportation to be Established: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's opening of the Haizhou route was a plan for the creation of Longhai joint transportation. The plan was formulated, but the war broke out, and the Longhai line became a war zone, so it could not be realized. Now that the military conflict is about to end, the Northwest Army (西北軍) has retreated, and the Longhai line can be restored. A large amount of materials blocked in Shanghai will also be transported there. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's joint transportation plan will also be implemented. Taking advantage of the fact that the Longhai line's military transport is not yet complete, the "Tonghua" ship will temporarily stop running two or three shifts to Haizhou and transport grain to North China. Once the road is open to traffic, it will be ordered to resume sailing. On the other hand, preparations are underway for the necessary procedures for joint transportation.</p>
<p>Recent Ship Accidents: The waters around Dapu (大浦) are not very wide, and the currents are very turbulent, making navigation extremely difficult. There is still a risk of accidents. Last year, the "Hualun (華倫)" was stranded and damaged, and last time the "Tonghua" ran aground. Recently, from August to the present, six salt-carrying ships have run aground there. Initially, the "Yongping (泳平)" and "Yongping (永平)" collided with each other at Dapukou (大浦口), suffering heavy damage. Then, the "Yingfa (英發)" ran aground outside the port and sank, resulting in huge losses. Currently, various shipping merchants have submitted a memorial to the Ministry of Communications requesting dredging of the river, removal of shallow reefs and sandbars to facilitate navigation. The Ministry of Communications has consulted the Jiangsu Provincial Government for thorough investigation to facilitate construction.</p>
<p>Negotiations on Da Zhen Wharf Construction: Da Zhen Company specially purchased land in Dapu, Haizhou, to build a wharf. The Shanghai Merchant Ship Captains Association (本埠商船駕駛總會) presented a memorial to the Ministry of Communications to stop it, stating that Da Zhen is building a wharf outside Yuxingyong Wharf (裕興永碼頭) at the northern end of the port. The water surface here is less than 100 feet wide, which is the narrowest part of the waterway and has the fastest current. The riverbank on the opposite side is curved and has many curves. In addition, the wharf occupies the middle of the channel, causing congestion, and the two banks are almost connected, leaving no place for ships to avoid danger. When the tide is low, the water surface is even narrower, creating a situation of sealing off the port. There have been six or seven accidents in the past month, and the "Yongping" almost crashed into the wharf upon entering the port. Dapu is a densely populated area of the Longhai, Pingpu, and Pinghan lines. In recent years, the number of passengers and goods has been increasing, and the number of ships entering and leaving the port has been increasing daily. Various companies are competing to purchase land to build wharves. However, the port is an inland port and is not under the jurisdiction of the Customs, and the government has not established a competent authority. Shipping merchants operate freely without any restrictions. Those who can control the overall situation due to the strategic location are considered to have a natural monopoly, regardless of traffic obstruction, public safety, and security (omitted). It is impossible to sit idly by and allow the safety of the majority to be harmed for the sake of one company, etc. It is heard that the Ministry of Communications has ordered Donghai County (東海縣) to investigate this case.</p>

<p>In addition to the National Products Fashion Exhibition and the Salt Conference held at the Dahua Hotel (大華飯店), the remaining activities of the Third National Products Promotion Conference (第三届國貨運動大會), led by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau (本市社會局), such as exhibitions, displays, recreational activities, and the opening ceremony, have been decided to be held at the China National Products United Commercial Center (中華國産聯合大商塲) on Nanjing Road. To stimulate interest in using national products, during the conference period (October 7th to 13th), anyone who purchases national products at the commercial center will be given recreational viewing tickets to add to the fun. To facilitate the promotion of products by domestic manufacturers, a temporary sales department will be set up in the commercial center for one week during the conference period to allow manufacturers from both Shanghai and other places to conduct business and expand publicity. A preferential plan has been drawn up separately. Anyone who wants to participate can contact the commercial center's office to register starting today.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the Third National Products Promotion Week (第三届國貨運動週) in Shanghai has been decided to be held from October 7th to 13th. It is heard that during the conference period, all postal correspondence to and from Shanghai has been approved by the Ministry of Communications to be forwarded to the Shanghai General Post Office (上海郵政總局) for stamping with the words "Shanghai National Products Promotion Week" to commemorate the event and promote it widely.</p>

<p>Opening Date Changed to November 1st</p>
<p>The preparatory committee for the cotton textile exhibition of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's National Products Exhibition Hall (工商部國貨陳列館) held its inaugural meeting yesterday at the Shanghai-based product collection office in Jiu'anli (久安里). Yang Wenquan (楊聞泉), the director of the hall, chaired the meeting and reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that the cotton textile exhibition is more important than other exhibitions because cotton textiles are more common among the people and not as expensive as other silk and wool textiles. Then, the following items were discussed and resolved: (1) The opening date, originally set for October 10th, has been postponed to November 1st due to insufficient preparation. (2) The Shanghai National Products Factory Federation (上海國貨工廠聯合會) (address: 713 Jiu'anli) will be used as the product collection office in Shanghai. (3) Transportation will be reduced in fees and exempted from taxes. (4) It is planned to hire directors for the collection of various items. (5) Sales methods and display procedures will be stipulated, and photography, tea, and refreshments will be provided at the end of the meeting.</p>

<p>Completion Ceremony Scheduled for the Shanghai Restoration Day</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works (上第市工務局) recently sent a letter to this newspaper stating that yesterday (25th), various newspapers in Shanghai (note: this newspaper did not publish it) widely reported that the completion ceremony of the Chen Yingshi (陳英士) Memorial Tower in Ximen (西門) would be held on October 10th, which is not true. Since the tower's construction began on May 18th of this year, the anniversary of Mr. Yingshi's martyrdom, it has been four months. Although the project is now largely completed, the completion ceremony has long been scheduled for November 3rd because that day is the anniversary of the Shanghai Restoration (本埠光復紀念日).</p>

<h3 id="e211">Record of the Standing Committee Meeting of the Red Cross Society <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>The 102nd Meeting</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society held its 102nd Standing Committee meeting on September 22nd. The attending committee members included Jian Lantang, Wang Boqi, Ha Shaofu, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Peiyuan, Tan Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Tan Rongpu, Yao Yuqin, Yuan Zhongwei, Huang Hanzhi, Zhang Tiemin, etc. Chairman Wang Yiting, and Recorder Wei Ruifeng conducted the proceedings according to protocol. The minutes of the previous meeting were read, and without any objections from the members, the Chairman signed them. (1) The Chairman reported that, according to newspaper reports, the Ministry of Interior, acting on the instructions of the Executive Yuan, had interpreted the Chinese Red Cross Society as a local charitable organization, subject to the supervision of the local government in accordance with the regulations for supervising charitable organizations. He had gone to Beijing to visit Tan Yankai, President of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Jiazeng, Vice Minister of the Interior, and Wang Zhengting, Minister of Foreign Affairs, to clarify that the Red Cross Society is an international charitable legal entity, not comparable to local charitable organizations, and is directly under the Central Government, so it should not be subject to the supervision of local governments. President Tan Yankai, Vice Minister Zhang Jiazeng, and Minister Wang Zhengting all agreed to maintain this stance, resulting in a very satisfactory outcome. It was resolved that a detailed report on the history of the Society be submitted to the Chairman of the National Government. He also mentioned that President Tan Yankai was deeply concerned about the dire situation in Hunan due to the disaster and hoped that the Society would provide assistance, requesting a public decision. It was also publicly discussed that, given the severe disaster in Liaoxi Suizhong, an appeal for urgent relief had already been published in the newspaper. Following President Tan Yankai's request, additional fundraising for disaster relief in Hunan should be initiated. (1) Jian Lanting reported that the regulations and by-laws of the Chinese Red Cross Society and its branches, as well as the election law, had been passed through the third reading by the Committee on Revision of the Constitution. The detailed rules of the Executive Committee of the Society had also been drafted by the Committee on Revision of the Constitution and had been passed through the third reading. He requested that the attending committee members review each item today. Wei Ruifeng then read out the regulations of the Chinese Red Cross Society. Wang Xiaolai suggested that Article 57, regarding the awarding of various medals of merit and the accompanying colored ribbons, might be inconsistent with the current system and should be deleted. He requested a public decision. The members agreed without objection. The remaining items were deemed satisfactory and passed. Wei Ruifeng then read out the by-laws of the branches and the election law, which were also deemed appropriate. Wei Ruifeng then read out the detailed rules of the Executive Committee. Lin Kanghou suggested that the compilation of credit reports was within the purview of the Economic Affairs Department, and that Item 6 of Article 17 should be moved to after Item 4 of Article 13, becoming Item 5. The original Item 5 should be changed to Item 6. The members agreed without objection and passed the motion. Jian Lanting suggested that the above-mentioned passed regulations should first be reported to the National Government for review and record. A public decision was made to proceed accordingly. (1) Jian Lanting proposed that Ms. Ketu, Youth Minister of the International Red Cross League, and Mr. Hausi, Youth Minister of the American Red Cross General Branch of the National Society, had visited the Society and stated that the Red Cross Societies of various countries attach great importance to youth members. However, the methods for managing youth members require specialized knowledge, and it would be best to send someone to study at the Youth Department of the American Red Cross. Upon completion of their studies, they could manage this matter. He, along with Chairman Wang, had discussed the matter, and Wang Yaoting, who is proficient in English, could be sent for study, but it would require an expenditure of 500 yuan. He requested a public decision. Lin Kanghou suggested that if he can serve the Red Cross and seek benefits for the Red Cross after completing his studies, why skimp on the expense of 500 yuan? A public decision was made to proceed accordingly. (1) It was also proposed that although the Epidemic Hospital had been closed on the 20th of this month, cases of Vibrio cholerae and autumn dysentery have recently broken out. The Bureau of Health has sent a letter requesting that the hospital continue to operate. It is now proposed to retain a small number of staff for diagnosis and treatment of epidemics. He requested a public decision. A public decision was made to proceed accordingly. (1) It was also proposed that the members of the Committee on Revision of the Constitution had worked diligently in revising the constitution this time and had made outstanding contributions. How should they be rewarded? He requested a public decision. A public decision was made to wait until all revisions of the constitution are completed before submitting them to the Society for review. (1) It was also proposed that the family members of the director of the Beishi Hospital are still residing in the hospital and have not yet moved out. How should this be resolved? A public decision was made that Chairman Wang should send a letter urging them to move out as soon as possible. (1) Wang Peiyuan proposed that the Society's regulations stipulate that a general meeting for soliciting members should be held every year in October. The time is approaching, and the disasters in Hunan and Liaoxi are extremely severe. The Society urgently needs to solicit donations for disaster relief. Appointing staff to handle the matter separately and widely publicizing it is necessary to expand membership and raise significant funds. He requested a public decision. A public decision was made to proceed accordingly. (1) It was proposed that the Relief and Fundraising Department had promised to allocate 1,000 yuan to the Kunming branch for gunpowder disaster relief. However, because the branch had not submitted a detailed report of income and expenditure, the payment was delayed. After the Relief and Fundraising Department was closed, this amount was not allocated. Now that the disaster relief funds have been almost completely allocated, there are no funds to allocate again. The branch has repeatedly sent letters requesting payment. How should this be resolved? A public decision was made that, since the Relief and Fundraising Department has been abolished, it would not be appropriate to give the funds again, and a letter should be sent to the branch explaining the situation. (1) It was proposed that a pre-donation from a household donated a single paper share certificate of Taichang Electric Light shares with a face value of 1,000 yuan to the Society. It is now worth one-quarter of its value. Fifty shares of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway stock are worth 5 yuan per share, and they can now be exchanged for public bonds, each worth 6 jiao. If a way to convert them into cash is not found soon, they may become worthless paper in the future. He requested a public decision. A public decision was made to convert them into cash separately. (1) It was proposed that Huang Zijing, the director of the Beishi Hospital, had reported in a letter that a student, Chen Jingsheng, had served in the hospital for more than six years. He was usually cautious in his work but unfortunately died of illness on the morning of the 4th of this month. His monthly salary of 8 yuan during his service at the hospital was extremely meager, so his family is destitute and he left behind a wife who is truly pitiful. He requested a pension. A public decision was made to grant a pension of 100 yuan. (1) It was proposed that the Haozhou branch had requested a subsidy due to the severity of the disaster and had already given membership badges to 80 regular members. He requested recognition of the case. A public decision was made to approve the recognition. (1) It was proposed that the Linru Dazhuangzhen, Shantou, Funing, Shimen, Jiaxian, Huangxian, Xiajin, and Zouping branches had requested subsidies for badges or incentives. Cao Qiweng of Yuting had lost his meritorious service badge. He requested that it be reissued. He had raised more than 1,000 yuan for disaster relief and introduced many members. It is not easy to introduce members to establish a branch. Can the foundation membership fee be paid at half price? He requested a public decision and asked that investigators be appointed to review the case one by one. Ha Shaofu and Yao Yuqin were publicly nominated as investigators. The meeting adjourned at more than 7 o'clock.</p>

The naval soldiers stationed on the Poyang Wheel also fired machine guns, killing two bandits in Xinhekou. Additionally, when the Datong Wheel sailed upstream with the Poyang Wheel, it was fired upon by bandits more than ten times in Xinhekou, but none of the shots hit. The British soldiers on the Datong Wheel returned fire with more than 370 machine-gun rounds. According to reports, more than thirteen or fourteen bandits on the shore were killed. The ships will not be going to the upper reaches of the Yangtze again after this trip. According to the Zi Lin News, the Taikoo's Fengtian Wheel sailed from Shanghai to the north a few days ago. After arriving in Yantai, a fire suddenly broke out in one of the cargo holds, and the goods loaded inside were slightly damaged. However, the ship's hull was undamaged.

<p>The Java Steamer Company was established on September 17, 1903. At that time, there were only three ships sailing between Japan, China, and Java. Now, it has increased to eighteen ships. Every month, there are four round trips between Yicheng and Shanghai, four round trips between Surabaya and Shanghai that circle Makassar, and one trip from Celebes to Hong Kong via Borneo. The total number of trips between China and Nanyang is about 120 per year. In the past five years, no less than 120,000 overseas Chinese have taken this ship every year. The lifeline of the company is in the hands of the overseas Chinese. How should the company treat Chinese passengers with courtesy? However, recently, a case of rape of Ms. Xiao Xinan, a newly hired female teacher at an overseas Chinese school in Nanyang, occurred. The details of the incident are appalling. Overseas Chinese are under heavy pressure. Although they are doing their best to support this case, their strength may be insufficient. I sincerely hope that the diplomatic authorities and the people in the country will unite to help Ms. Xiao seek justice. The details of this incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Female teacher Xiao Xinan departed from Shanghai on August 14 on the Tjibadak. Ms. Xiao Xinan, a newly hired teacher at Peide School in Ambon Island, also took this ship to Ambon Island. Xiao is from Yixing, Jiangsu Province. She graduated from the No. 1 Women's Normal School in Jiangsu Province ten years ago. She is nearly thirty years old and unmarried. She is quite stable and has a talent for conversation. Peide School admired her reputation and sent several telegrams urging her to come. She finally agreed to be hired. Ambon Island is in the east of Celebes, and transportation is inconvenient, so it is quite difficult to hire additional teachers. Ms. Xiao's resolute departure this time shows her deep concern for education.</p>
<p>A crew member rapes a weak woman. Xiao, with her weak constitution, traveled alone in second class. She was very polite to the crew members on the ship. This is a characteristic of our country of etiquette. Who knew that it would be taken advantage of by the Western villains? The crew member rape case occurred on August 25, one day before the ship arrived in Makassar. After Ms. Xiao was raped, she immediately told the details of the incident to the overseas Chinese on the same ship, hoping to get help.</p>
<p>The ship's doctor diagnoses her with neurosis. Tao Yin, the Vice-Consul in Surabaya, Xiang Xiamin, the general manager of the Zhongnan Company, and Liu Jingwen, a famous philosopher, were on the ship. They all thought that this incident was bizarre and inhumane. They questioned the captain clearly. The captain then summoned the ship's doctor for examination, but the ship's doctor vaguely diagnosed Ms. Xiao with a nervous disorder. Although Ms. Xiao is thirty years old, she is still a virgin. She has been teaching for seven years and has been very successful. Now, the ship's doctor is calling her mentally ill, which clearly shows the Java Company's collusion and adultery. After arriving in Surabaya, Tao Yin told the newspaper about this incident, and the reporter used his flowery language to greatly distort the facts. For the past three or four days, Ms. Xiao has regarded this incident as related to the national honor and has specially told the details of the incident to her friends and made it public in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese are very indignant. After learning about this incident, the various overseas Chinese organizations in Makassar were very indignant. On the first day of this month, more than ten representatives of various organizations accompanied Ms. Xiao to the consulate to request serious negotiations. On the second day, the Kuomintang branch held an emergency meeting. They all agreed that this incident was particularly important for the future relationship between overseas Chinese women. Ms. Xiao is educated and knowledgeable and dares to tell the world about her humiliation. There may be many others who have been humiliated but dare not speak out.</p>
<p>Organize the Xiao Case Support Association. On the evening of the third, more than 200 overseas Chinese from industry, commerce, and academia held a gathering and elected Jiang Yusheng, Shi Jiesheng, Ye Tianxia, Gu Yicen, and other gentlemen to prepare for the "Xiao Case Support Association" in order to thoroughly negotiate with the Java Company (javacbiajaQanlijnco) and achieve the final victory. On the evening of the fourth, another joint meeting was held, inviting the consul to be responsible for the negotiations.</p>
<p>Ms. Xiao's letter to a friend. Now, let's explore a letter from Ms. Xiao to a friend and transcribe it as follows: Mr. Koukou, I am very grateful for your care and concern during the trip. I was unfortunately attacked halfway. Because of my shyness, I didn't want to tell others about this trauma. Who knew that two Europeans would collude and act evilly, forcing me to the point of death. Although I have managed to avoid the insult, physical contact can still cause some changes. Our country has always valued chastity, and I am deeply resentful and painful for suffering this humiliation. What is the joy of being alive in the world? The thought of suicide is circling in my mind again. I am afraid of causing trouble on the ship, so I close the room tightly and sew clothes to pass the time. People come to harm me, and in the environment at that time, it was difficult to call for help. I don't cherish my life, but I am thinking of my elderly mother, how can I reassure her? I am just stealing a few days of life for this. I think you, as a compatriot of the motherland, will definitely be able to provide support. Xiao Xinan wrote in tears on August 30. The original text of the告僑胞 (gào qiáobāo - message to overseas Chinese) Ms. Xiao wrote a "Record of a Weak Woman's Lonely Journey and Encounter with Danger," which she told to the overseas Chinese. The original text is as follows: I have been serving the community for seven years, and I have been in four schools. I dare not boast about the faith and reluctance of the students and colleagues in each school. You can know it by exploring it in the country. However, because I have been to various places in Jiangsu Province, I feel like I am sitting in a well and watching the sky, and my knowledge is limited. This spring, a friend also had the same ambition, so I did not accept the persuasion of the old hall and family, and resolutely agreed to be hired by a certain school in Nanyang. When the departure date was approaching, my friend suddenly changed his mind, and it was difficult to find a replacement for a while, and the school sent a telegram eight times and my ship ticket had been purchased, so I could only travel alone. It is well-known that people from Jiangsu are timid. I was uneasy in the center of the sea route. On the evening of August 13, my friends in Shanghai sent me to the 芝巴德 (Zhībādé - Tjibadak) ship and asked them to introduce me to passengers who were traveling with me as a guarantee. I traveled happily through Xiamen and Hong Kong, and all my fears were forgotten. After the boat passed Hong Kong, the wind and waves gradually increased. Although I did not have a headache, I felt slightly nauseous. Except when I went to the dining hall, I fell on the head of the bed. On the 20th, I felt a little used to it and my spirits were as usual. Thinking that every inch of time is precious, I took out the silk material from the box and sewed clothes to avoid paying import taxes. I started learning to walk early in the morning. Because the trousers were not very elegant, I sewed them on the rattan couch in front of the window in the room. The first mate of the boat asked what I was doing. I showed him the trousers. He pointed and taught me to turn to the electric fan. I followed his words, but before I reached the goal, he entered the room to repair it, causing his hands to be covered with black oil. He took his clean white clothes and wiped it. I took the electric fan because I turned it bad, and he repaired it. I should have taken water for him to wash it, and then closed the wooden window. I still thought he was repairing the window for me. I walked forward and told him where it was broken. He immediately hugged me in his arms and asked me to love him. I replied that I already had a lover for two years and could not love him. Please forgive him. Before I finished speaking, he stretched his tongue into my mouth. I quickly turned my head, and he kissed my face and chest indiscriminately, wanting to achieve bad goals. I cried and shouted for help, but my room was far away at the stern of the boat, and there were no guests on the left, and the male guests on the right and opposite had all gone downstairs. In addition, the electric fan and the sound of the waves were loud, and outsiders could not hear it. I ran to the window and wanted to go out of the window. He immediately knelt down and apologized and left. I felt that he knew his mistake and forgave him to maintain his position. After that, I felt a swelling pain in my chest and knew that my body was injured. Sadness arose. I wanted to tell others that because of his judicial status, I could not get evidence at that time. He would definitely deny it and only attract laughter. Moreover, after the incident, it may be related to my future, so I can only turn into a frightened bird, tightly close the room to prevent ferocious beasts from invading. I sat in a sad city and cried for my unfortunate destiny. The next day, the deputy came to the window three times and knocked on the door. I resolutely refused his request. He even climbed to the window and jumped on the boat to show that he was going to harm me. I ignored him. He left. From then on, I became more and more timid. That night, I was about to tell Mr. Xiang Xiamin that the first mate and second mate came together. Seeing them in the dark was even more frightening. I knew that my life was at stake, so I went to the dining hall downstairs and wrote a letter of farewell to my family, crying as I wrote. Mr. Xiang also saw it. Not long after, the second mate came to my side with a flashlight. I put away the paper and pen to avoid his harm. He said, "You write Chinese letters, I don't read them for you." In fact, I knew that he did not understand Chinese, so what was there to be afraid of? However, I heard this and my fear was slightly reduced. On the afternoon of the 23rd, at about 3:00 PM, the first mate came to the window again and greeted me to open the door. I locked the door tightly as I did yesterday and was safe and sound. I just sewed clothes. Suddenly, a first mate stood down in the window hole. I ran to the door, but I was too anxious to open it and was caught. I was kissed and touched. I struggled to escape, causing the spittoon to fall and shouting loudly, but no one asked. Moreover, after I shouted loudly, he guarded my throat with one hand. I tried my best to escape to the rattan couch and prepared to kill him. My left hand touched the scissors and my right hand resisted his head and kissed and bit my body. But his eyes were on me and I measured my weakness. I could not hurt him and was killed by him instead. Blaming others, I did not dare to take this cruel action. Finally, I stood up and planned to escape to the window. He immediately knelt down and begged for mercy and left. From then on, I became more and more sad. After dinner, I asked about the political and legal rights of the Dutch territory. Mr. Lin, a fellow passenger, replied that the Dutch people in the boat were in the highest legal position and everything could be resolved by reasoning and did not need to be intense. This made me more suspicious of the separation of political and legal rights in the Dutch territory. The words I wanted to say were buried in my heart. Later, I reviewed Malay on the deck and saw the second mate holding a can of food and a flashlight in one hand and said to me, "You will be going to Makassar soon, and we will be leaving tomorrow. I will give you a can of things as a souvenir." I replied, "I am passing through Makassar, and I don't want your things." He walked around the deck and came again. I used the name of the first mate to repair the electric fan to harm me and did not get evidence to escape his guilt, so I took his things and asked him to write his name. He agreed. I pointed him to stand on the deck and guard him. I entered the room to take a pen. Unexpectedly, when I entered the door, he also entered the room and put the flashlight and canned goods on the high bed. He locked the door with one hand and held my head and neck with the other. After the door was locked, I saw him unbuttoning his trousers and taking out his penis and pushing me down on the bed. I told him that I would rather die tonight and would not be insulted by you. He still continued. I felt his hand pinching his pants and entering my lower body. I cried and shouted for help, but my voice could not reach outside. Helpless, I took half a bottle of seasickness medicine from the pillow and took it. He stopped when he saw me committing suicide. When he saw that I was having a drug reaction, I was dizzy, my stomach was twisted, and my throat was blocked and it was very uncomfortable. He took the opportunity to escape. I could only cry and be unfortunate to be born in this world and even more unfortunate to take this boat with few passengers and many rooms. The most inappropriate thing was that I was initially ashamed and afraid of death. Then, Consul Tao, Li, Xiang, and other gentlemen and Madam Li from Fujian knew about it. At that time, the medicine bottle fell on the head of the bed and the vomiting situation was seen by them. What face do I have to meet people after suffering this humiliation? I would rather die cleanly. Unexpectedly, the next morning, the effects of the drug subsided slightly and my mind was clearer. I felt that this matter was not only a personal humiliation, but also a matter of great importance to the national honor and especially to the overseas Chinese. Because there are many wives and daughters of overseas Chinese traveling by sea, I think overseas Chinese are more concerned about this matter, so I hereby announce it and hope that my compatriots at home and abroad will resonate and help me negotiate with the Java Company until the company actually expels the first and second mates on the 芝巴逹 (Zhībādá - Tjibadak) ship and compensates me for my personal reputation. If I die from poisoning, I am also willing to go to the underworld. Consul Tao was very responsible for handling this matter on the boat, and after Makassar, Consul Tao transferred it to Consul Wang because Ambon Island belongs to Makassar. The day I got off the boat, I wanted to announce it to the overseas Chinese to avoid misinformation. At three o'clock in the afternoon, I heard Consul Wang tell me that the compatriots here knew that it must be because of my misconduct that this happened. How secret and wrong! When people enter the deep mountains, fierce tigers come to bite them. Whose fault is it? The enlightened ones have their own public opinion. As for the reason why I have not dared to announce it many times, there are also reasons, which are described in the following: (1) I was sailing for the first time and did not know how many types of staff there were on the boat and what the duties of each staff member were. I only knew that the deputy was in charge of the judicial power on the boat. What are the methods for reporting and punishing them if they break the law? (2) I did not know the hearts of the overseas Chinese and the political and legal rights of the Dutch territory. (3) Knowing that the first and second mates had colluded to catch one person, there was still one person to avenge them, and I still had three days and nights of lonely sea voyage to go after I arrived, fearing that resentment would lead to danger. (4) The original school and family of my job strongly discouraged me from taking it. If I died halfway, how would I face them? (5) According to my observation, anyone who wants to do this must have two purposes: prevention and avoidance. Calling for help outside the room will definitely hurt my body, and calling for help in the room will definitely achieve the purpose. My room is isolated at the stern of the boat, and they must have explored the surrounding area when no one is around before coming. (6) The tea room on the boat had already seen it. Who would be willing to be a witness because of the bread problem? (7) There were only a dozen people in the second class above and below the boat after Hong Kong. Half of the people were upstairs, and there were forty rooms. There were few passengers and many rooms, so it was more difficult to call for help. Moreover, my room was at the stern of the boat, and the sound of the wind and waves was louder than in other places. Moreover, in addition to two or three people who spoke the same language, the rest did not even meet and nod. (8) I have a family economic burden and a certain school has been looking forward to it for a long time, especially since I have an old mother in the hall. If I die, she will definitely die in a hurry, and it is difficult to die. (9) The end of the negotiations requires me to resign and hire a lawyer myself. I don't have this economic power and it is difficult to fulfill my wish. (10) There is a group of people in the country who hold the principle of not caring about other people's business and a large part of the officials are afraid of trouble and bullying the weak, worrying that no one will help to avenge this humiliation after it is discovered. Yesterday, I read in the newspaper that people from all walks of life can speak out against injustice for me. Now, I have learned that the Dutch government governs the country by law and that legal rights are fair and will never be transferred by power and emotion. No other country can do this. Moreover, now that I have the apology letter from the Java Company, it cannot satisfy people, so I am telling the world about this matter in detail. Who is right and who is wrong is up to the public to decide. That is what I hope. Xiao Xinan cried in Makassar.</p>
<p>The Dutch overseas Chinese are indignant. At this time, the Xiao case has aroused the indignation of all the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies. Various organizations in various ports have come out to discuss that it is not difficult to find a solution. However, the law-breaking staff on the 芝巴德 (Zhībādé - Tjibadak) ship are extremely bold and abominable. The captain's confusion and hearing is inherently the position he must take, but the ship's doctor does not care about humanity, does not examine the facts, and does not ask his conscience. He even erased everything with the four words "suffering from neurosis" and reversed right and wrong. The doctor's duty is originally for charitable undertakings, but the actions of this ship's doctor are extremely absurd. Commentators say that Mr. Xiao should immediately ask a world-famous doctor for a diagnosis and then file a lawsuit with the "Netherlands Government Doctor Examination Permit Office" so that the colluding and illegal doctors can be hidden and the future of humanity will be bright. The situation of future progress will be explored and announced again.</p>
<p>Organize pseudo-agencies</p>
<h3 id="e217">Guarantee Deposit Fraud <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Impersonating Lawyer Jiang Yiping</p>
<p>As Many as Seventeen Victims</p>
<p>Unable to Fully Recover Guarantee Deposits</p>
<p>Shen Guofan and Gao Jingyi Both Detained</p>
<p>Recently, newspapers have carried advertisements for China Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Savings Company, stating that the company's business office is on Beijing Road and its preparatory office is located at 504 Carter Road. The founders are Shen Guofan from Ningbo, Gao Jingyi from Songjiang, and Gao's son, Xiao Zhang. Their legal advisor is listed as Lawyer Jiang Yiping, but Jiang has never accepted such an appointment. These people are using his name without Jiang's knowledge. However, with so many unemployed people in society these days, everyone is seeking employment.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Seeing this advertisement, they believe that since there is a location, responsible people, and a famous lawyer as an advisor, there is no need to worry about being deceived. People such as Cao Wensheng, Yao Xuanyu, Chen Shanqi, Pan Nianci, Cai Keming, Gu Rusheng, Pan Zuoyi, and seventeen others successively registered and took the exam at the preparatory office. Gao Jingyi, posing as the chairman of the company's board of directors, determined the amount of guarantee deposit to be paid by the examinees according to the seniority of the position assigned. The minimum amount was fifty yuan, gradually increasing to two hundred yuan, eventually collecting more than two thousand yuan in cash. Receipts were issued in accordance with the names, stating that they would be notified by letter when the company officially started operations to come to work. Later, Cao and others waited outside for a long time without hearing any news, so they went to Jiang Yiping's law office to inquire. Jiang then learned that he had been used, and Cao and others realized they had been deceived. They went to the preparatory office and Beijing Road to visit Gao Jingyi and others to recover the money they had paid. However, these people had already fled. They had no choice but to complain in vain. Until 4 PM on the 17th of this month, Shen Guofan suddenly appeared on Nanjing Road and was met by Cao and others. Upon negotiation, Shen invited everyone to Room 1446, Yongxiang Lane, Xinzha Road to discuss. As a result, Shen handed over two passbooks with a total deposit of more than one thousand one hundred yuan. Cao and others then withdrew the money and distributed it according to the amount defrauded. For those who had been defrauded of one hundred yuan, they could only recover fifty-two yuan and two cents. Cao and others were still unwilling to suffer losses for no reason and insisted on full compensation. Because Shen could not comply, they reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, which sent detective Yang Xinzheng to arrest Shen and strictly investigate the whereabouts of Gao Jingyi. Then Gao was arrested and account books and forged share certificates were seized. Only Gao Xiao Zhang had already flown away. Yesterday morning, Shen and Gao were escorted to the Special District Court, where Judge Sun Yuan presided over the hearing. Only nine of the plaintiffs were present. According to Cao Wensheng's complaint, "I went to register after being introduced by a friend and was assigned as the director of the cashier department, paying a guarantee deposit of two hundred yuan. Later, because I waited for a long time without any news, I became suspicious and visited Lawyer Jiang, only to find out that I had been deceived." The other eight people, including Yao Xuan, also described their registration process. Shen admitted that he and the Gao father and son organized this agency to defraud guarantee deposits and claimed that he had paid five hundred yuan in shares. Gao Jingyi shirked responsibility. The court ordered the defendants to remain in custody and rescheduled the hearing for seven days later.</p>
<h3 id="e218">New Evidence in the Consort Mei Case <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Consort Mei's Signed Receipt Discovered</p>
<p>Handwriting Comparison Shows High Similarity</p>
<p>Case to be Re-Debated</p>
<p>The case of prostitute Consort Mei, accused of conspiring with Hu Yongquan to defraud Zhao Guangzu of his prescription, has seen Hu escape to Hankou. The debate on Consort Mei's part was previously concluded, and she was ordered to pay one thousand yuan bail while awaiting sentencing, as reported in this newspaper. It has now come to light that Hu Yongquan, who is on the run, suddenly sent a letter to Zhao Guangzu a few days ago, attaching a receipt signed by Consort Mei. The letter stated that the prescription was mortgaged to someone else for four thousand yuan. At that time, Consort Mei took one thousand yuan and wrote a receipt, which is now being returned. Yesterday morning was the scheduled date for sentencing in this case. Consort Mei still appeared in court, while Zhao handed the letter and receipt to his representative lawyer, Lu Qi, to present to the court for inspection. Zhao stated that since this new evidence had been obtained, the debate must be reopened and requested a postponement of the public judgment. Judge Sun immediately compared the receipt with Consort Mei's handwriting and found the handwriting to be very similar. However, Consort Mei vehemently denied writing the receipt. Judge Sun decided to have the handwriting authenticated by an expert and ordered Consort Mei to pay three thousand yuan in bail and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Opium Smoking in Silk Firms <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Four People Each Fined Five Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Gong Taifeng and Longchang Zhen, two silk firms located in the Zhengda Silk Warehouse at 62 Jingyuan Lane, Beijing Road, were found to have opium smoking paraphernalia to supply those in the silk industry with opium habits to indulge in their addiction under lamplight. Recently, the Vehicle Affairs Office, which specializes in investigating opium, has been strictly prohibiting opium in general firms and wealthy private residences. The silk warehouse and silk firms were also searched by Western Police Head Pan Gengsi and Chinese Detective Huang Ruiting at 1:30 PM the day before yesterday. Four exquisite opium pipes, three opium lamps, and six taels of opium were seized on the spot, along with five people from Huzhou, Suzhou, Sun Yuting, Ye Xinzhi, and Cao Baisheng, who were smoking opium. They were taken back to the General Police Station and allowed to pay a cash bail of five hundred yuan each. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen of the Special District Court presided over the hearing of the defendants. The defendants hired lawyer Zhu Sifu to defend them, saying that Ye Xinzhi had recently fallen ill and felt cold on the way to the police station yesterday, so he was unable to attend. He also presented the doctor's prescription. Then, Police Head Pan reported the search process and presented the defendants' confessions in the police station that they had privately hidden opium paraphernalia. Judge Shen questioned the four people who were present, but they all shirked responsibility. As a result, Xu, Zhang, Sun, Ye, and Cao were each sentenced to a fine of five hundred yuan, and the opium paraphernalia was confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Maid's Elopement Related to Dentist <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Maid Sentenced to Two Months' Imprisonment</p>
<p>Dentist Fined Three Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>A Mr. Wang from Sichuan brought his family to Shanghai nine years ago and rented a house at 1008 Gongping Road. Wang's wife, Zhu, kept a maid named Hehua. She was just ten years old when she came from Sichuan to Shanghai and is now nineteen years old. A dentist from Fujian named Ren Li, who lived next door, often visited Wang's residence and became acquainted with Hehua. This year, Ren suddenly moved to 1975 Zhoujiazui Road, and Hehua also disappeared on the morning of July 23, stealing 150 yuan in cash, two fox furs, and many other clothes. Her master reported it to the police station and asked them to investigate. It has been two months now, and the whereabouts of the maid are still unknown. The day before yesterday afternoon, Wang and Zhu were out on business and unexpectedly met Hehua on Yuezhou Road. The maid saw the madam and wanted to avoid her, but she was pointed out and taken to the Huishan Police Station by the sentry post. According to Hehua's confession, after escaping from the Wang family, she first went to Ren Li's residence to ask him for help. Ren rented a room for her at 96 Yuezhou Road so that she could live there. The rent and food expenses cost a total of ten yuan per month, all provided by Ren Li. The stolen clothes, except for a part that is still at 96 Yuezhou Road, were deposited with Ren, including a fox fur coat and other clothes. The police head ordered detective Cao Xirong to first go to Hehua's hideout to seize dozens of stolen clothes, and then went to Ren Li's house to seize the fox fur and other clothes. Ren Li was arrested along with Hehua. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Special District Court. Hehua was charged with theft, and Ren Li was charged with receiving stolen goods. Judge Ge Zhiqin presided over the hearing. Wang and Zhu explained the maid's elopement after being seduced by Ren Li and hired lawyer Fan Gang to request an investigation. Hehua confessed that she had been abused by her master, so she took her own clothes and her master's discarded clothes and ran away, and had no relationship with Ren. Ren confessed that he rented a house for the maid to live in, but had no other relationship with her. Judge Ge verified the confessions and sentenced Hehua to two months' imprisonment for theft and Ren Li to a fine of three hundred yuan for receiving stolen goods. If he was unable to pay, he could be imprisoned for one day for every two yuan. The stolen goods were to be returned to the plaintiff.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Further News on the Shanghai University President's Threat Case <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>The case of Dr. Liu Zhanen, President of Shanghai University, being repeatedly threatened by letters has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. This news has spread throughout society and caused great surprise. Dr. Liu's family is known to be poor, and he is known for his thrift and integrity. It is said that the reason for this unfortunate event is that he was being held hostage to indirectly extort a large sum of money from the school. However, Shanghai University's finances are managed by the school's Economic Committee, and the president has no authority to use funds arbitrarily. Moreover, in recent years, to meet the needs of constructing the library, faculty housing, water tower, and other items, there have been insufficient funds and repeated fundraising efforts, which are still ongoing. The economic situation is very strained. If these people were to kidnap the president, the school would have no power to prepare the money for ransom. Their actions would be unwise. It is heard that Dr. Liu recently told people that he has no grudges in his life and believes that this is a complete misunderstanding. However, he believes that the increasingly difficult lives of civilians often lead them to take risks. He said that this is a great hidden concern in society and that we should vigorously promote public education and work hard at the grassroots level. He does not care about personal interests or safety.</p>

<h3 id="e224">Little Girl Student Missing <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Kong Juying, a nine-year-old girl student from Pu Si Free School at 13 Yunju Street, Anhai Road, inside the Old North Gate, is lively and intelligent and is well-loved by teachers and students at the school. At eight o'clock the night before last, she suddenly disappeared. After searching everywhere without success, the school authorities feared that she had been abducted and sold by bandits, making it difficult to inform the girl's family. That night, the school sent Huang Dingnian to seek help from the Relief Association for Women and Children and the Water Police Station, requesting that they pay attention to her on all outgoing ships. The girl has short hair, a long face, and very large eyes, and is wearing a pink short shirt and white trousers.</p>

<p>Boy Jin Yinsheng Unforgivably Cruel</p>
<p>Jin Yinsheng, a fourteen-year-old boy from Nanxun, relies on selling pears for a living. Yesterday afternoon, he placed his pear basket on the ground in front of the Wang Chunyuan stove shop in Lan Ni Du, Pudong, and went elsewhere to urinate. The owner of the stove shop, Wang Xia, was nearly seventy years old but still energetic. She raised a small police dog named Laixi, spending dozens of copper coins a day to buy beef to feed it without hesitation, cherishing it more than her own children. At that time, the dog was playing in front of the store and suddenly urinated in the pear basket, causing the pears to be soaked from top to bottom. Jin saw this and rushed over. His livelihood depended on the basket, and now the pears smelled bad, so no one would buy them. He became enraged, grabbed a small knife, held the dog, and stabbed it in the stomach. Blood flowed everywhere. Because the injury was to a vital organ, the dog fell to the ground and died. Wang Xia saw her beloved dog die in such a cruel way and burst into tears. She twisted Jin and the dead dog to the Third District Public Security Bureau and demanded that the district chief impose a appropriate punishment and buy a small coffin for the dog to lie in. The district chief heard this and smiled, sentencing Jin Yinsheng to five days of detention to appease the woman's anger. Wang Xia left with the dead dog, disgruntled.</p>

<p>Ordered to Treat Her Well</p>
<p>Jin Dekang, who lived at number eighteen, Songbai Lane, Qiujiang Road, reported to the French police station a few days ago that his wife, Wang Guizhen, had secretly fled while he was away on business. He had now learned that she was hiding in Room 15, New China Hotel, Hongyun Lane, Huagen Road, and requested that she be arrested for questioning. The police chief approved his request and immediately ordered detective Hang Guangfu to arrest Wang Guizhen and bring her to the police station. Yesterday, she was sent to the French court for questioning. Plaintiff Jin Dekang stated that defendant Wang Guizhen was a female merchant from Xujiahui Catholic Church and also a fellow member. They were officially married at the Catholic Church on November 24, 1928. After she married into the family, she was treated like a mother and cherished like a pearl. However, he never won the defendant's favor. Before long, her heart changed and she had an affair with his relative, Feng Yuqing. They were found to be opening a room at the Da Zhonghua Hotel. Since he was away on business more often than at home, his wife often went out with Feng to open rooms for illicit affairs. This time, she fled again and opened a room at the New China Hotel, so he reported it to the police for arrest and requested an investigation. When questioned, Wang Guizhen, 22 years old, from Suzhou, confessed that she was indeed formally married to the plaintiff, but when the plaintiff married her, he deceived her by saying that he was British. After the marriage, they immediately returned to the country, but she learned that the plaintiff had no property or occupation. One day, she asked him why he did not go to England, and he immediately slapped her several times and confined her to a room, restricting her freedom. Moreover, the plaintiff's age was 37 years older than hers. This time, she ran away in a fit of anger and borrowed a room at a hotel with a classmate. She did not dare to commit any illegal acts. The plaintiff has been abusing her in this way, and she does not want to go home with him. She requests a fair judgment. Judge Zhu ruled that Wang Guizhen should be taken back by Jin Dekang and treated well.</p>

<p>Xu Heshang, who lives at No. 58 Dengyun Street in the city and runs a fruit business, has a beloved daughter named A-San, six years old, born in Suzhou. One day, she was playing in front of the door and disappeared. It was later learned that she had been abducted by Ding Hairong, the son of Ding Shen, who lived next door at No. 60. Ding Hairong was not seen at first, but was later found in Zhabei. Due to disputes, Liu Jun, the sixth watchman of the Second District, Second Division, took Ding Hairong and Xu Heshang to the station. According to Xu Heshang's confession, his daughter A-San was abducted by Ding Hairong, the son of his neighbor Ding Shen, at 1 PM on the 21st. Ding Hairong then fled and disappeared. Now he has entrusted someone to find him and requests an investigation. According to Ding Hairong's confession, Xu Heshang's daughter A-San was abducted and sold by him to a Mr. Wang from Jiading for sixty yuan. After deducting all expenses, he only received twenty-two yuan. He was deceived into doing this under duress. When asked where A-San was now, he claimed not to know, fearing that Mr. Wang was also a trafficker and would resell her to others. Director Guo believed that Ding Hairong dared to abduct Xu Heshang's six-year-old daughter and received sixty yuan, which he admitted without hesitation. The case involves the crime of human trafficking, which is a separate legal provision. He was ordered to be sent to the Local Court for severe punishment.</p>

<h3 id="e249">Impressions of a Trip North (5) <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Su Ling</p>
<p>(5) First Glimpse of Harbin</p>
<p>The sun rises from the snow-covered eastern mountains. The passengers in the carriage start to stir and become noisy. My heart also starts to pound. The end of this long journey is approaching.</p>
<p>“Harbin!” The train stops at this station. All the passengers on the train scramble to get off.</p>
<p>When I walked out of the carriage, the first thing I felt was the cold of the north. People were wearing very thick cotton overcoats with high, large fur collars turned up. They wore fur hats on their heads. Some Russian workers were wearing large, long fur boots. I was still in my southern clothing, especially my felt hat and the collar of my coat, which was not fur, did not cover my ears, and they felt particularly cold.</p>
<p>After shivering in the cold air for a few times, I hired a car and left the station for the Art College on XX Street.</p>
<p>I had known for a long time that Harbin was divided into Daoli and Daowai. Daoli was the Special District, and Daowai was Binjiang County. The Chinese Eastern Railway ran through the middle. The Art College was in Daowai.</p>
<p>The car drove on the streets of Harbin for four hours before finding the Art College. There was no sound inside. Had it moved? Or was it closed? I knew I was out of luck and had to ask the driver to take me to a hotel.</p>
<p>After settling my luggage, I went for a walk on the unfamiliar streets of Harbin. Because I had encountered so many unfortunate events, I had become accustomed to them. Although I was alone in the strange northern frontier, I did not have a single friend or relative. Now I had come alone. Yes, there were many dangers of being stranded ahead, but I was not afraid of them at all.</p>
<p>Oh, it is so embarrassing and dangerous to fall on the busy road! But I fell twice! The snow on the road had frozen and hardened. It was very difficult for people who were not used to doing sliding step dances or skating to walk.</p>
<p>Daoli in Harbin was completely Europeanized, and it was difficult to find Chinese people on the streets. I was walking alone on this unfamiliar street and fully felt the oppression of the foreign atmosphere. I heard people say that Harbin is the St. Petersburg of the East.</p>
<p>I spent three days like this. Lao Ding came and his first words were to blame me for staying in such a big hotel. But I didn’t know. I was brought here by the driver. Lao Ding said, “I redeemed you from the hotel.”</p>
<p>“I really didn’t expect you to come.”</p>
<p>“You asked me to come. But why is the Art College gone?”</p>
<p>“But the Academy of Art is waiting for you.”</p>
<h3 id="e250">New Atmosphere at the Law School <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Law School in the 19th year of the Republic is clearly incomparable to what it was before. From the outside, the towering new school building will inevitably catch your eye as you pass Jiangwan Road. The school gate and the Great Hall are also under construction. The busy workers and the clanging of hammers can be seen and heard at any time. Let’s examine the contents in detail. The library is filled with books, as all the book fees paid by students each semester have been used to purchase books. Furthermore, Mr. Qian Xinzhi, Chairman of the Board, generously donated 2,000 yuan yesterday. The library is located on the third floor, and the reading room is particularly spacious and well-lit. The desks and chairs are all new and arranged in an orderly manner. The students are quiet when reading, and walking in feels like stepping into a chapel for worship. You can’t find a trace of noise. The seriousness of the coursework has not just started this semester. It has been strict since last semester. The principal, dean of studies, and all the staff of the academic affairs office strictly monitor the students during regular roll call and exams. The chief examiner professors occupy the most important seat. Not to mention this semester, there are several professors who are truly rare, such as Mr. Pan Dakui and Mr. Wang Qufei. The old professors, such as Mr. Dai Junliang and Mr. Zhang Yaozeng, Mr. Wang Fuyan, etc., are especially rare in this transitional era. The two female professors, Ms. Ying Zhangsu and Ms. Zhang Peifen, are admired by people from all walks of life for their knowledge, and their teaching methods are especially welcomed by students. Let’s look at the spiritual aspect. Starting with the professors, everyone is full of the vitality of spring. Everyone seems to have unlimited love and sincerity for each other. The male and female students also seem to have dispelled some of the barriers. This is all worth praising. In short, everything is constantly improving and striving for perfection.</p>
<h3 id="e251">The Future of Datong University <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— You Pei</p>
<p>Time flies by quickly and never stops for even a moment. The rustling golden wind drives away the scorching sun and brings a beautiful sky with bright moon, indicating that autumn has arrived. This tells us that the summer vacation has passed and we should pack our books and review our old studies. Therefore, in recent months, schools have been busy with enrollment and registration, turning day and night upside down. This is especially true of the newly emerging Datong University in West Shanghai. The history and development of the school have been published in detail in this column and in various newspapers, so I will not repeat them here. The school has increased its student body by more than 700 students this semester, and the new school building has also been completed and moved on September 11. Previously, the former principal of the school, Mr. Ou Yuanhuai, once said, "I work from sunrise to midnight, and I cannot rest even in my dreams." This was certainly a few words of hard work and dedication revealed by Principal Ou when he was in difficult and arduous times. But even now, the school affairs are developing rapidly and the affairs are becoming more and more numerous. The teachers and students of the school are full of the spirit of struggle, sacrifice, cooperation, and construction. In order to preserve the glorious history of the past, they are still continuing to work hard as Principal Ou said. For example, the new student enrollment reception was organized by the student union in conjunction with the school affairs council, which appointed enthusiastic students such as Yang Shaozhi, Wang Jianmin, Xu Zexiang, and Zhao Yixue to take charge. Although several reception committee members have sacrificed their time and energy in the past few days, they have saved hundreds of new students from the pain of being unfamiliar with the place. This kind of effort is not insignificant. Although the matter is small, the school's spirit of mutual aid can be seen in a glimpse. It is now heard that the school has completed the registration procedures on the 17th and officially started classes on the 18th. As for the professors, such as Dr. Huang Jingsi and Dong Renjian, etc., are all well-known figures at home and abroad, and their works and experience are extremely rich, and the students have also expressed their satisfaction. But what is most worthy of our attention is that the principal of the school recently announced the future development direction of Datong University. In summary, he said, "In the future development direction, in terms of material construction, I think the most basic buildings of a university, in addition to classrooms and dormitories, should have independent buildings for science and libraries. And we sincerely hope that Datong University will complete the construction of the science museum and library within three to five years. In these years, we must actively purchase books and equipment. Once the most basic buildings and equipment are reached, we will raise a fund of five million yuan to stabilize the foundation of the school. As for psychological construction, it is even more important issue for the school. In the future, the psychological construction of our school can be divided into three points: First, the cultivation of a sound personality; second, the cultivation of true knowledge and practical skills; and third, the identification and cultivation of leading talents" (see the Datong University Sixth Anniversary Publication). In today's society, which is full of old-fashionedness and accumulated problems, it is not easy for Datong University to be unaffected and to be completely renewed. And the school authorities are showing the students with material construction and psychological construction, which is really a unique enthusiasm of educators.</p>

<p>Czech sculptor Bobuslavkoci has been in China for many years and has been well-known for painting and sculpting statues for important people. Recently, in response to the requests of his colleagues, he has established a private art school at his private residence at 17 Route Doumer, teaching young people who are interested in art. The courses taught include drawing, modeling, sketching, plaster statues, bronze statues, stone statues, etc., which can be called complete. It is said that the teaching of arts such as sculpture and statue making is an innovation in China or in the Far East. The left is a photograph of Koci's recent marble bust of Hu Hanmin.</p>

<h3 id="e253">Traces of War <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Shaozhi</p>
<p>Written by Wu Guangshao, published by Beixin Book Company</p>
<p>War is about sacrificing many lives and materials. War is indeed worthy of being cursed. However, seeing the Chinese nation suffering a great deal of hardship, with hardship dominating the entire Chinese nation, in this dying situation, are we still willing to be content with temporary ease, or are we willing to struggle for a while for permanent survival? If in a critical period, we still care about temporary ease and say that war is a sin, I think this is truly digging our own graves. Therefore, although war is not a good thing, for the sake of the nation's survival, for all internal and external wars for national independence and freedom, no matter how great the sacrifice, I think it is still necessary. Weighing the importance of the two, we naturally have to sacrifice some lives and materials in order to seek the permanent victory of national freedom and independence.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the results of the European War, people in various countries are tired of war, and this reaction has also arisen in literature and art, striving to advocate non-war. However, if we carefully analyze the core of this non-war argument, how is it? The imperialists' so-called non-war cannot avoid thinking that they are in a noble position. After all, it is their act of showing some compassion to say a word of non-war as a kind of gift to the weak nations. In fact, this is the true face of despising weak nations. If weak nations also say that they should be non-war, this is simply digging their own graves, directly expressing their weakness, and indirectly begging the imperialists for mercy. And this is simply a dream. If we want our own nation to survive permanently in the universe, the only way out is that we should strengthen ourselves and prepare to fight for national independence and freedom, so that we can have the possibility of permanent survival. Therefore, texts recording such tearful, inspiring, lamentable, and sighing traces of war have great value.</p>
<p>Traces of War is such a creation. He uses the power of literature and art to depict the progress of the National Revolutionary Army. He wants to use the power of literature and art to express the glory of sacrificing for the nation, so that they are eternally engraved in the hearts of the general public and eternally infused in the blood of the general public, so that they know that this kind of war should be commemorated and praised.</p>
<p>This book tells us that</p>
<p>"Lin City, which had been stubbornly resisting the enemy for a long time, did not see any traces of beast hooves in this hasty glimpse. The sparse smoke mostly came from thatched huts, showing a desolate and declining scene everywhere."</p>
<p>Let's look at the situation in Ling'er's home in the "After the Looting" chapter, where the remnants of the warlords who were defeated and plundered the people were so tragic!</p>
<p>"As if two wolves were dragging a lamb, they dragged Ling'er's mother out from under the bed. She struggled as much as she could, and shouted as much as she could, but to no avail. In the end, she was lying on her back under someone wearing gray clothes. Another person blocked her mouth with a handkerchief and tied her hands with leggings. She was subdued, and her feet were still kicking desperately. The vicious wolf pulled out a shiny刺刀 and stabbed her leg fiercely. She could not resist after all. After about an hour, they triumphantly took the bag and left."</p>
<p>We know that under this heartbreaking state, suffering the brutal ravages of the warlords, should we work hard for the people? Can we still endure it? Can we still be content with the moment? We naturally have to brace ourselves, raise the banner of light, and bravely go forward to eliminate the warlords. This kind of war to eliminate great harm for the people and to seek survival for the nation is naturally necessary, and naturally deserves to be recorded and publicized in literature and art.</p>
<p>This book has a total of ten creations, namely "Yali", "Kidnapping", "Drifting", "Badge", "After the Looting", "Belt", "Expedition", "Return", "Regroup", and "Visit to Yue". "Expedition", "Return", and "Regroup" are consistent and describe the scenes and feelings that the author witnessed when he participated in frontline work. "Yali" describes a promising young man who set off to participate in the front line. He knew that it was glorious to die for the nation, so he was happy to sacrifice. The other chapters can be said to be anecdotes of military life and the general situation of the suffering suffered by the people during the military period.</p>
<p>From the chapter "Yali", we can see the author's will and show a stronger willpower, and further recognize the glory of fighting for the party and the country.</p>
<p>"Why should a good man's bright blood flowers disappear in the embrace of men and women? Why not transplant them to the battlefield where he fights for the party and the country!"</p>
<p>This is probably the proper consciousness of the author of this book, so he participated in the most front-line work. In this chapter, he further attacks how incisive and precise the old ethics of the patriarchal society are. Look at what Yali said:</p>
<p>"I know, I deeply know that fame is a false embellishment, and face is a pretentious pile. I would rather be a traitor to the false morality than a sinner in real life."</p>
<p>This is such a brave and stirring statement. She finally broke through the dikes of etiquette and morality and obtained the ultimate happiness in life.</p>
<p>In addition, after reading this book, what makes me deeply sad is that there is such a passage in the chapter "Return":</p>
<p>"Scattered encounters with a few colleagues, they were all in a hurry to ask me about the news of their colleagues. From the extremely painful, extremely angry, and extremely hateful conversations of these colleagues, I know that the original group of beasts who were making trouble in Jinan and wanted to destroy our national revolution were plundering there, eating people there, and being irrationally rampant there."</p>
<p>Readers, we should still remember, right? What happened in Jinan on May 3 two years ago? New shame and old hatred surged into my heart. We should remember deeply. We should wake up greatly.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Secret Vow <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Shuhui</p>
<p>By Jin Guangmei, Era Youth, Issue 6</p>
<p>The commodification of literature has become a natural and accustomed practice in Chinese literary circles in recent years. Authors imitate each other without feeling shame, striving to emulate those who make fortunes through writing romance stories. Thus, triangular, quadrilateral, and polygonal relationships are depicted in a chaotic mess, with characters addressing each other in intimate terms, acting secretively and furtively. The more sexual matters are described, the more they cater to the readers' psychology, anticipating high sales. Bookstore owners are happy to invest large sums to purchase such works. Consequently, a continuous stream of romance writers has emerged in recent years, creating things that are disgusting. Writers are happy to write it, bookstore owners are happy to buy it, and readers are happy to read it, but they are also being anesthetized without realizing it. Although this type of work and writer continue to be produced, another group of people who consider themselves to be part of the times believe that these are products of the past, outdated people who should no longer be serving as loudspeakers for the bourgeoisie and petit bourgeoisie, playing the love games of young masters and young ladies. As a result, literature that shouts poverty and hunger, slogans, and stickers has emerged, filling the market. Proletarian literature is a fashionable import, and who doesn't love fashion? Who wants to be left behind? Even old men with beards are starting to bang on broken gongs. In this situation, authors strive to create, bookstore owners are willing to collect, and readers rush to read. In short, the commodification of literature is a minor issue; the impact on society is nothing more than corruption and degradation.</p>
<p>Most lovers of literature are young people who are easily influenced. Young people are the inheritors of the country and the nation. If such corrupting and degrading ideas are instilled in young people, what can we expect for the future? Chinese literary works should reject and correct all past misconceptions, actively establishing a central ideology that motivates young people to strive for the nation and the country, preventing them from wandering astray. Such works are what we need now.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I sent my younger sister to school in Shanghai and bought the newly published sixth issue of "Era Youth" at a newsstand. Its content was surprisingly rich. In addition to theoretical articles, the most unforgettable piece after reading was Jin Guangmei's short story "Secret Vow."</p>
<p>"Secret Vow" depicts the humiliation of Chinese people in foreign films. The author uses concise language to write about profound and moving scenes, making readers feel as if they are there, watching the insulting portrayals of Chinese people unfold on the screen in a movie theater. The general plot is as follows: A very wealthy couple, who are usually arrogant and only care about their own interests, never think about their nation. Later, they see a foreign film depicting various shameful scenes of Shanghai insulting the Chinese people. They are slightly moved. As the film becomes more intense and bizarre, they become more tense and embarrassed. As a result, they become more aware. They cannot bear the pressure in the theater and finally flee home. They spend a sleepless night in remorse and then secretly vow, "From now on, we are willing to sacrifice and dedicate ourselves to our Chinese nation."</p>
<p>The author expresses that the interests, honor, and disgrace of the nation are closely related to all people, regardless of their poverty, intelligence, or foolishness. The disgrace of some is the disgrace of the entire nation, prompting the awakening of national consciousness. The author uses economical writing to encompass a wide range of facts, such as the opening:</p>
<p>"Ronggui, drive the car back and come back in two hours."</p>
<p>What economical writing! From these two sentences, one can infer how rich the Zhang family is, thus determining that the author is skilled at writing short stories. At the same time, the author's imagination is also very rich. The depiction of the scenes on the screen is very detailed without being tedious. The author describes how Chinese people in foreign countries are impolite, unhygienic, and urinate everywhere, coincidentally meeting a young and beautiful girl. This girl is naturally angry and resentful, but the Chinese gentleman not only feels no shame but also expresses a triumphant victory. Such writing is so profound. Also, "Those ladies in high heels were slipping on Chinese people's spit," "Hands full of Chinese people's spit," "Gentlemen in wide robes and large sleeves with eight-patterned long coats, square patches, red-topped hats with peacock feathers, hanging court beads, and high-soled powder boots, socializing with humble and subservient gestures. The ladies with bound feet walking with the support of walls, sleeping in opium dens accompanied by gentlemen smoking opium," "Chinese funerals with road-opening gods, ghost fighters, lion, deer, camel, elephant, Gongbu A-zi cards, twelve flower gods, eight immortals, and figures, ten-thousand-people umbrellas, merit boxes, Taoist sheng flutes, Buddhist chimes, nuns' wooden fish, gongs and drums, flags, and military bands—everything is available." It is written in great detail.</p>
<p>The author's portrayal of the protagonist's psychology is also particularly subtle. The most tense moment is when the screen shows more bizarre insults to Chinese people, and the foreigners laugh more happily. The Zhang couple becomes increasingly awkward and embarrassed, their faces turning blue, red, and gray, as if they cannot survive the day. Even the candy boy who walks in front of them has no mind to pay attention to them, only the tide in their hearts is constantly rising and falling.</p>
<p>"Although I have a beautiful wife, a tall Western-style house, abundant food and clothing, a new car, and considerate servants, I don't care about political affairs. Fortunately, my job is in the concession, my address is in the concession. I can do my job as a bank manager. What does international status or semi-colonial status have to do with me? What does it matter to me whether the nation is oppressed or not? But now, this screen has made me realize, deeply realize, that I see our nation being insulted, bullied, persecuted, and ridiculed."</p>
<p>Originally, Mr. Zhang thought of himself as being extremely individualistic, but now he is fully aware. Although the insults on the screen are not directed at him, he cannot stand aside from this shame. He thoroughly understands that the nation is a whole, and he is naturally a member of the Chinese nation. As a result, he cannot sleep that night, and the two decide to make a secret vow to each other.</p>
<p>Although the material in this story is inevitably influenced by the Hong Shen "Fear Not Death" case, the author further depicts such a sensational case of foreigners insulting several of our people into a novel, making the people of the country pay more attention to it, which is really commendable. This is truly grasping the work of the times. In the past revolutionary processes, how many things were worth recording, but unfortunately, no writer noticed this and grasped it. What a pity! I hope that future writers will do more work that guides life and write less disgusting things that are supposed to be interesting.</p>

<h3 id="e255">Caoye Weekly <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Nanxin</p>
<p>Volume 3, Issues 6 and 7</p>
<p>In the realm of purely literary small publications, Caoye Weekly stands as the most exquisite bloom. This flower undoubtedly blossoms more alluringly, captivating the hearts of many. Its fragrance permeates throughout the Chinese literary garden, effectively transcending its namesake status of a desolate "Caoye" (wilderness). Particularly noteworthy and heartening is its unwavering central consciousness in both writing and thought, with each poem or prose piece infused with a rich sense of nationalism. Given that each writer possesses their distinct style, we, the readers, find it devoid of monotony, which serves as an elevation. Lately, the publication has further solidified its battle lines, with the sixth issue commencing with a poem-formatted "Message to Readers," exhibiting a steadfast commitment to nationalist literature that is truly admirable. A section is extracted below:</p>
<p>We possess an indomitable will,</p>
<p>We possess heads forged of iron and stone,</p>
<p>Fear not external alienation and slander,</p>
<p>Even less do we fear all difficulties and setbacks.</p>
<p>They nakedly expressed the attitude of their entire collective. They are performing in the form of a whole collectivist doctrine. The standard has invisibly penetrated the correct central consciousness of nationalism, and whether working on literature or other academics, in addition to having the correct central ideology, it is also necessary to have the determination to persevere to the end. The so-called external "storms" need not be taken into account, as long as one's own line is strict and solidarity is achieved, which is to increase the infinite power of progress. These are clearly told to us in this "Message to Readers" poem.</p>
<p>In the seventh issue, two articles are worthy of attention. One is a poem by Mao Mingdao named "Before the Tomb of a Warrior," earnestly eulogizing with utmost majesty, such as:</p>
<p>Before the tomb, small wooden plaques stand in a row, inscribed with "The Tomb of a Warrior Who Sacrificed for the Chinese Nation." After such a long period of wind and rain,</p>
<p>The handwriting is not blurred at all,</p>
<p>Not blurred at all.</p>
<p>Who does not remember that you are warriors who sacrificed for the country?</p>
<p>Warriors, you are all eager to fight for the freedom of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Only when the banner of revolution was raised to fight for the nation did we know that you sacrificed your lives.</p>
<p>Your spirit is eternally immortal, and your historical achievements will last forever.</p>
<p>Now, your tombstones stand tall, and many brothers who love their country have rushed to</p>
<p>The front of your tombstones.</p>
<p>In our so-called semi-colonial China, there are indeed many warriors who have fought and sacrificed for the Chinese nation who deserve ardent commemoration. Moreover, their great spirit and deeds can serve as a model for future generations to be brave, to rise up with heroic determination, and to advance forward. Such a narrative poem with profound significance is very much needed in the current Chinese literary scene. The author, Mao Jun, was able to find poetic material in this kind of historical fact, and the emotions are unusually warm and intense. The boldness of the words and the magnificence of the tone are all expressed in this poem. The last section is especially worthy of repeated chanting:</p>
<p>Listen to the sounds of the front line,</p>
<p>Listen to the bugle call on the horse's back,</p>
<p>Warriors hold high the revolutionary banner and move forward,</p>
<p>Igniting the flame of glory for the nation,</p>
<p>Rushing through the strongholds defended by imperialism,</p>
<p>Friends, let us sing loudly,</p>
<p>"Victory to the Chinese nation,</p>
<p>Warriors shout triumphant return!"</p>
<p>Here, there are not only descriptions of various forms on the battlefield, but also the mission that the warriors should shoulder to move forward, and finally, a powerful encouragement to the inevitable realization of what is hoped for. It is not easy to express such a complex connotation in a lively way in the form of poetry. Secondly, the short essay "Warriors, Recognize Our Responsibilities" by Wang Tiehua is also worthy of recommendation as a rare masterpiece.</p>
<p>The author's attitude is very serious. He uses profound insights to judge that all Chinese contemporary youths should quickly take on major missions and future goals. At the same time, he cites many historical facts from all over the world about "dying for the motherland" that are faithful to nationalist literature as the basis for "Warriors, Recognize Our Responsibilities." The emergence of nationalist literature is by no means empty or unsubstantial. It has its own historical background and realistic environment. In China, the profound theory of nationalist literature already has a solid foundation, and it is bound to emerge in the literary world. Therefore, the author once said very thoroughly, "The beginning of this great work is the establishment of nationalist literature. It is necessary to first give a painful criticism to the confused and mixed thoughts of young people, and then to give a sobering warning to the people wandering in the difficult times. In fact, historical facts tell us that we must fulfill this responsibility." This is an undeniable fact. In the last paragraph, the author writes even more powerfully: "Dear warriors, recognize our great responsibilities. Great responsibilities have been entrusted to us since history, and it is time for us to shoulder the glory of the Chinese nation for five thousand years, to stand up with weapons and begin to fulfill our responsibilities. Sweep away the evil mist, destroy the viciousness, and get rid of all tools of aiding abuse. This is the current responsibility of the warriors who fight for the nation." We, the readers of this publication, should pay close attention to this sharp short essay.</p>

In recent days, purchasers have been extremely crowded, all fearing to miss the good opportunity, it is said.</p>
<p>Shanghai Modern Bookstore announced that the book All Quiet on the Western Front published by the bookstore was originally written by the German Remarque and jointly translated by Mr. Hong Shen and Ma Yanxiang. The book has more than 400 pages and more than 200,000 words, and is accompanied by portraits and biographies of the original author. The original book was published in Germany in January last year, and within three months, there were translations in all countries of the world. The total sales exceeded three million copies, which is a record in the world's literary world. Now, the translation by Hong and Ma is faithful and fluent, and can express the original author's feelings. There is also Ma Yanxiang's nearly 10,000-word preface, which has a very sincere discussion of the value of the book and the difficulty of translation. Hong Shen's postscript has many citations and explanations about war literature. Recently, the Shanghai Nanjing Grand Theater has shown the film All Quiet on the Western Front, which is completely based on Remarque's novel. The general audience who wants to understand the detailed inside story of the film must have one copy per person, and the special price for each copy is one yuan.</p>
<p>Dujinsheng on North Sichuan Road announced that since the factory held a price reduction recently, the retail and wholesale sales have been exceptionally bustling in recent days. The silk landscape and colorful brocades produced by the factory are far from comparable to those produced by other factories. The newly released third edition of art samples is extremely precious, and those who purchase more than ten yuan can receive a copy as a preferential treatment, it is said.</p>
<p>Xinchangmao Hat Store at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Touji Bridge announced that its store specializes in selling various domestic felt hats and high-end European and American felt hats produced by Guanyi Hat Factory. The styles are novel, the prices are low, and the quality is good. Now, the store's renovation has been completed, and the opening ceremony will be held today.

<p>Xindongfang Theater on the north side of Yokohama Bridge, North Sichuan Road, announced that since the theater performed the improved national opera, it has attracted the attention and approval of the community and is indeed a highlight in the theater world. It is heard that the second improved national opera, Three Halls Joint Trial with the Execution Ground, is now being performed. The play is adapted according to the historical biography, and the plot is completely different from the old Jade Hall Spring. The plot is tense and bizarre and requires more than two hours to perform. The scenery is specially made by experts using scientific methods to create more than a dozen three-dimensional scenery, which is completely like the real thing and has never been seen on the Chinese stage today, it is said.</p>
<p>Paris Grand Theater announced that the theater will show Dorothy Gish's masterpiece London A Weak Woman starting today. The film tells the story of a lonely orphan girl who suffers all kinds of hardships and finally ascends from hell to heaven. Gish's performance is gentle, sad, and euphemistic, and her expression is excellent. At the same time, the Russian balalaika king, Bosakov, has also been hired to perform on stage. The tone is melodious and moving, and the fingering is pure, skillful, and agile, which is truly a superb skill, it is said.</p>
