<p>怠工情形閘北公共汽車平時於清晨六時起即行開駛載客昨晨六時各工人均照常到廠工作一如往日將一二三路汽車二十六輛全數開出然至七時許忽一致怠工寳山路口之發票人先將車票收入箱中停止發付各路行駛中之車輛亦即任客登車毋須買票售票上均袖手而立與乘客爲伍故外表上均不知公共汽車工人已經怠工也</p>
<p>各車擁擠昨日天雨各路公共汽車即不怠工其載客人數亦必較平時爲多然自工人怠工搭客無須買票之消息傳出後各車上之乘客顿時增加即無意搭車者至此亦均隨衆上車照各車載客祇規定三十二人至此則乘客之數少亦四五十人多者或且加倍公司方面得悉此事深恐載重過度難免肇禍即知照警局請沿途注意昨一日公</p>
<p>司方面之損失約在千元左右</p>
<p>職工要求工人怠工之原因爲要求年賞與制服兩項今述其原委如次閘北華商公共汽車公司共有汽車二十六輛分爲三路行駛即（一路）汽車十一輛行駛寳山路口至江灣（二路）汽車四輛行駛虬江路四川路新閘橋間（三路）汽車十一輛行駛寳山路口眞茹以上三路共有開車售票職工早晚兩班一百餘人各職工於十月二十四日開會議决向公司要求發給年終雙俸及冬季制服十月二十五日即由職工會向公司提出而公司之答復謂年終俸給此時尙早將來自有辦法冬季制服如須厚呢衣料其費用則由公司及職工各負一半因是未有結果嗣後繼續請求至本月十七日止先後其有七次終無要領</p>
<p>談判經過各職工於本月十七日後多數主張怠工公司車務部主任黃中文即以職工之醖釀報告於公司當局進行談判公司中遂派任作君爲代表出與職工談判結果職工原定要求年終雙俸一月最低限度須得雙薪二十五天公司方面最高限度發給賞工十五天不能再加於是談判中止雙方决裂前晚十時各職工集合職工會開會討論議决開車售票一致全體怠工作最後之要求並呈請該管第六區黨部及市黨部民訓會社會局等各機關請求調解</p>

<p>公司態度據公司方面聲稱現有職工一百六十餘人各職工工薪司機每月廿五元至四十九元售票廿元至二十四元查票員卅五元至卅九元每月另加升工工資三天獎勵金每六個月一算凡工人於六個月中並無過失者得領獎勵金自三十元至四十元不等工人中平均百分之九十均能得到此項獎勵金也至於此次之祗允發給十五天年賞者實因本年度公司方面因金匯關係影響物料之昻貴者甚多大有入不敷出之勢即欲發給十五天之年賞亦覺勉强無奈雙方協商無效工人即以怠工爲抵制然工會並不於事前呈請上級機關調解突然怠工且任意開車不停站不收車資或且自由進廠公司對此實屬無法制止祗有聽候當局之處置云</p>

<p>梅花館主</p>
<p>覇王别姬一劇在舊劇中佔有極大之勢力梅畹華數次南來每貼别姬之夜售座必陡增數倍其魔力眞是不小余於此劇曾觀光三次第一次在天蟾舞台是時飾項羽者爲小樓當然别有精采第二次在共舞台以無小樓同來故覇王一角不得不由周瑞安承乏貌似神非相去遠矣第三次在大新舞台（即今之天蟾舞台）去覇王者爲金少山少山雖無小樓之莊嚴沉着然其一副暗嗚叱咤之歌喉實足予觀衆以相當之滿意此次南來此劇曾贴演一次余以事冗未及往觀惟據友輩傳說謂少山近來功候日深火氣已脫較數年前實高明多多　華年事雖增以化裝神妙之故扮相並不因之而稍見减色至做工與表情當然與時俱進益見其出神入化也</p>
<p>畹華在蓓開公司所灌（自從我隨大王東征西戰受風霜與勞碌年復年年恨祗恨無道秦把生靈塗炭才惹得衆豪傑逐鹿中原四句係唱慢板鎔治新腔舊調於一鑪别有一種境地他人唱來决無此好聽也今年秋間梨園公報某君對於畹華别姬慢板頗滋懷疑謂畹華在臺上（自從我··）四句向唱摇板今在蓓開片中忽改唱慢板認爲有研究之必要並謂戲的規律摇板根本不能改唱慢板云云余當時對於某君之論調未敢據爲信史蓋余在共舞臺一次深知畹華唱此確係慢板而非搖板（有當時小申報拙作記述爲證）然余不願自信過甚乃函詢畹華本人請其據實答復以釋疑　不數日畹華即有復函寄余謂（自從我隨大王··）四句本唱慢板其後因全劇時間有時嫌長故亦偶唱摇板非必然也灌片時係依照原舊唱法故爲慢板臺上唱摇板時誠如某君所云係臨時變通辦法也）據此以觀可知唱慢板乃是正路唱摇板實非所宜也</p>
<p>北平某聞人小有才智平時自作聰明好竄改名伶唱詞以爲樂曾記此君對於别姬（自從我··）四句慢板亦擅加删改將第三第四（恨祇恨無道秦把生靈塗炭才惹得衆豪傑逐鹿中原）兩句改爲（何日裏方得免兵戈擾亂消却了衆百姓困苦哀憐一不侫以爲原詞落落大方正是虞姬口吻某君改句不但氣魄不大而造句亦無原詞之飄逸有致點金成鐵弄巧反拙若某君者可謂不知自量者矣</p>

<h3 id="e25">Gold Scarcity <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The price of gold is increasing daily while the price of silver is decreasing. Thus, the reason for this is the so-called "gold scarcity." Why is gold scarce? Upon investigation, the reason is said to be the hoarding by the United States and France. Various methods have been proposed to save the depreciating silver, but they have not yet been implemented. To alleviate the gold scarcity, efforts are being made to mine gold. Rumors of gold deposits have been discovered in Panama, Nevada, and Ontario. In addition to gold mining, there is also the business of air transport of gold. For example, an airline will be opened between London and Cape Town in South Africa to transport gold from the Witwatersrand gold mines to London. The faster journey will save interest during transport, and this route will surely be very profitable. From this, we can see that for anything that has special profits to be made, the abilities of the world will be used exhaustively to seek those profits. The current high price of gold is a clear manifestation of this.</p>
<p>In the end, although there are precise investigations and detailed statistics from various countries regarding the reasons for the high price of gold and the low price of silver, the ultimate cause is still unknown. If it is said that the supply of goods exceeds demand and causes commercial decline and factory closures, then one day there will surely be a demand exceeding supply. If it is said that gold is being hoarded and not circulating, causing a gold scarcity, then once the hoarders release the gold, there will surely be a day when the gold scarcity becomes a gold surplus. Nothing in the world is certain and unchanging. However, the way things are carried out by the people in the world is what matters. Why should those who strive for profit necessarily be able to obtain it?</p>

<p>Nanjing, the judicial sector is considering a draft of the implementation law for foreigner litigation. The main points are: (1) All civil lawsuits where foreigners are plaintiffs or other parties should be charged litigation fees in accordance with current laws and regulations, and they should be required to submit legal complaints. (2) If a foreigner is a profit-making organization that has not registered in accordance with Chinese laws and obtained legal person status, they may not sue in the name of the legal person. However, in accordance with Article 555 of the Civil Code, the manager may represent the business as plaintiff or defendant or in all litigation matters. If it is a foundation or a public-purpose organization with independent property, before it is recognized by China, it should be handled in accordance with Article 15 of the Implementation Law of the General Principles of the Civil Code. When a foreign legal person has legal dealings with others, the actor should be jointly and severally liable. This approach is a transitional measure for foreigner litigation after the recovery of legal rights. In the future, Chinese law must be followed in all cases. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing, the Ministry of Finance explained the business tax surtax case for various provinces, stating that Article 6 of the "Standard for Dividing National Revenue and Local Revenue" promulgated by the state stipulates that after the division of national taxes, each party should reorganize their finances and not add surtaxes. Business tax is one of the local revenue sources, and the collection of educational expenses as a surtax is inconsistent with the facts. The relevant provincial governments should be notified to investigate and handle the matter. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

Dozens of people were arrested.

Shidehara replied that the oppressive measures taken by the Soviet authorities were a violation of international trust, which was extremely regrettable.

He hoped that diplomatic negotiations would be promptly initiated to assess the right and wrong of the matter, and reiterated the demand for a protest to the Russian ambassador, similar to the previous instruction to Ambassador Hirota.</p>

<p>Diplomatic Personnel Killed; Six Hundred Released</p>
<p>Former Political Prisoner Association Links with Opposition Parties</p>
<p>Riga Dispatch - Over the past year, the Soviet authorities have summoned their representatives stationed in various countries back to Moscow, and as many as three hundred have been executed by Vologda (Soviet Secret Police) on various charges.  Consequently, in recent times, Russian representatives stationed abroad, mindful of this danger, have openly resisted orders. According to recent statistics, the number of personnel defying orders is also approaching three hundred.  Communist leader Stalin is extremely enraged and worried, suspecting that opposition party leaders are instigating this. Furthermore, the executed and disobedient Soviet diplomatic representatives are all outstanding talents. Their deaths and dismissals have created a sudden lack of replacements, and Soviet foreign policy is facing difficulties in responding and coping, which may lead to failures.  It is rumored that the Soviet authorities, mindful of this, have decided to hire a large number of foreign communists to join the Foreign Affairs Committee and fill the vacancies. Moreover, the "Former Political Prisoner Association" is one of the most powerful gatherings in the Soviet Union. Most of the current government leaders are members of this association, and the membership restrictions are extremely strict. Recently, some members expressed support for the anti-Stalin party, which was detected by Stalin. He immediately stripped many of their membership rights. Although the association immediately issued a statement of repentance, it has yet to regain Stalin's trust. Furthermore, the renowned Red Party writer Maxim Gorky recently published an essay in various Soviet newspapers titled "Annihilate the Enemies."  The gist of the essay was that those who oppose the current government are brewing natural and man-made disasters, placing ordinary farmers in mortal danger. The government, for the sake of its principles, should continue the civil war to eliminate all reactionaries.  This shows that internal discord in the Soviet Union is indeed growing day by day (World News Agency).</p>

<p>Amsterdam, 20th Dispatch (National News Agency) - According to recent news from Java, the Merapi region first experienced ash rain on Friday morning.  In the afternoon, a strong earthquake suddenly occurred, followed by a large quantity of molten lava and large rocks erupting from the crater, causing widespread disaster.  Currently, it still shows signs of continued eruptions, and the residents are extremely frightened.  Mount Merbabu, which has been dormant for a long time, also shows signs of revival.  As a result of Mount Merapi's eruption on Friday, the number of casualties is estimated to be between 150 and 300. Due to traffic obstruction, the details of the disaster are still unknown.</p>

Professor Bourchard went there ten days ago. Now the guide has returned injured, saying that he escaped after the eruption of Mount Merapi. Soldiers have been searching for Professor Bourchard's whereabouts for several days, but without success. He is probably no longer alive.

<p>London, 20th Dispatch (Reuters) - The aviation business between London and Cape Town, South Africa, is contracted to transport gold from the gold mines. Currently, people in London are wondering whether this route is sufficient to drastically change the world's economic geography.  Some say that because the journey is faster, this route is bound to make a big profit, as it can save interest on gold during transportation. In the future, Cairo could become the world center for the distribution of gold and seize the position of the Bank of England. However, the London bullion industry is skeptical because Cairo has no gold refineries.  In recent days, there have been repeated reports of new gold mines being discovered. Since HSBC director Addis issued a warning about a global gold shortage, the world has paid close attention to the discovery of gold mines. There are rumors of gold mines being discovered in Panama, Nivada, and Ontario.</p>

<p>Hankou Correspondence - Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek traveled to Lushan for sightseeing after inspecting Jiangxi. Generals such as Xu Yuanquan, Xia Douyin, Xiao Zhichu, Xie Bin, Liu Maoen, and Hunan Provincial Chairman He Jian were summoned to the Kuling Headquarters for individual meetings. The new plan for suppressing bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces was decided at that time. Xu Yuanquan, Xia Douyin, Xiao Zhichu, Liu Maoen, He Jian, and He Chengjun returned to Hankou together the day before yesterday to arrange everything. Now that Chiang Kai-shek has completed his tour of Lushan, he descended the mountain on the 20th with Shao Lizi and Zhou Fo-hai, arriving in Xunyang in the afternoon and boarding the Yong Sui warship. He set sail at 11 p.m. that night. Chen Shaokuan, Vice Minister of the Navy and Commander of the Second Fleet, personally led the Minquan and Chuyou warships to escort him. It is estimated that he will arrive in Hankou on the 21st. The headquarters in Hankou received Chiang's telegram informing them of his arrival on the Winter Solstice and immediately ordered all agencies to warmly welcome him. The city government notified consulates of all countries to fire cannons and fly flags in salute. The welcome preparation committee has already prepared welcome arches, welcome flags, slogans, and banners. It has also inquired at stations along the way for updates on the itinerary to inform agencies, groups, and schools to line up for the welcome. Regarding Chiang's arrival in Hankou, the people of Hunan and Hubei provinces eagerly hope that he will be stationed here to supervise the suppression of the Communist bandits. However, because Chiang Kai-shek must return to Beijing to participate in the New Year's Day military parade, he may not stay long. According to sources from the headquarters, Chiang Kai-shek will only stay in Hankou for two or three days before returning to Beijing. It is even more difficult to realize his stay in Hunan. However, Hunan Provincial Chairman He Jian is still here and may ask Chiang Kai-shek for instructions before returning to Hunan to be responsible for supervising the suppression. Due to the urgent need to unify the party, government, and military affairs of the three provinces during the suppression of bandits, Chiang Kai-shek, based on the decision of the 117th Standing Committee of the Central Committee to entrust the party affairs of the provinces in the bandit suppression area to Chiang Kai-shek Zhongzheng for guidance, specifically telegraphed the headquarters to be responsible for handling this in order to achieve unity and effective command. He also sent two proclamations, one to the people and one to the bandit suppression generals, to be distributed by the headquarters and posted everywhere (December 20th).</p>

<p>Visiting Various Scenic Spots on the Mountain</p>
<p>The Date of Departure for Hankou Has Been Confirmed</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence - Commander-in-Chief Chiang, after discussing the plan for suppressing bandits in Hunan and Hubei with He Chengjun and He Jian in Lushan, also met with other generals individually, giving instructions on the organization of the troops and the distribution of defenses. Chen Diaoyuan came to Kuling to report on the situation after moving from Shandong to Anhui and to request instructions on policy guidelines. Ma Fuxiang came to discuss the handling of matters in Jin, Shaanxi, and Gansu. According to the Lushan Management Bureau, Chiang visited scenic spots on the mountain for days. On the 14th, he visited the Three Waterfalls and the Immortal Rock, and dined with Wu Zhihui, Song Ziwen, He Chengjun, Ma Fuxiang, Liu Wendao, and others in the evening. On the 16th, he walked with Wu, Shao, and Zhou to the White Deer Cave, Haihui Temple, and the Five Elders Peak. The White Deer Cave is where Zhu Xi studied and lectured, and it has a rich collection of books in the White Deer Academy. Chiang stayed at the White Deer Academy that night, reading various ancient books. However, the ancient books treasured there were once destroyed by fire and then scattered overseas (sold to Japan). What remains is just a small part, which is regrettable. On the morning of the 17th, Chiang, accompanied by Wu and others, passed through Xiufeng, Wanshan, and transferred to the Returning Song Relic Pagoda, the hot springs, and Zili, and returned to the White Deer Academy to rest. He returned to the headquarters on the 18th. Now that Chiang has almost finished touring the entire mountain, he is scheduled to depart for Hankou before the 21st. Except for those on the mountain, the staff of the general headquarters have already arrived in Hankou. The Yong Sui warship is preparing to sail (on the 20th). The departure date will not be postponed again. As for those who went to the mountain to meet Chiang, He Chengjun, He Jian, Xu Yuanquan, Xiao Zhichu, and others have already returned to their defense areas due to the importance of bandit suppression and government affairs.

<p>Shantou Correspondence - The Zhu-Mao Communist bandits, who fled into Fujian last month and captured Changting, recently abandoned Changting and fled to Yongding and Shanghang's Jinfeng, Gaotou, Kuzhu, Xiayang, and Zhongkeng. They looted and burned extensively wherever they passed. Representatives from Fengshi specially sent Chen Ziqiang to Shantou to report the emergency and request help from neighboring Dabu County, Guangdong Province. When the Communist bandits invaded Zhongkeng, they split into several routes and invaded the Guangdong border. On the 14th, Dabu County specially dispatched the Security Team to cooperate with the defense forces to rush to Gucun and Zuobi to block them. The bandits then kidnapped more than ten women and children in Zhongkeng and fled towards Xiayang. When the military police arrived in Zhongcun, they immediately recalled the local village defense and police teams to maintain order. According to a telegram from Brigade Commander Zhang Da, stationed in Meixian, it reads: (According to Regiment Commander Chen (Ju), who in turn received a phone call from Xie Jiayou, the head of the Xunwu Rescue Township Regiment, saying that according to a phone report from the Yunmenling branch office of our regiment, two divisions of the Central Bandit Suppression Force are along the Nanfeng Guangchang area to Xingguo, and two divisions are along the Gan River to Ganxian. Another five divisions are distributed along the Gan River, jointly surrounding the main force of the Zhu-Mao Communist bandits, who are currently fleeing to Donggu, Xingguo, which belongs to Ningdu, and are currently being suppressed. I have ordered reconnaissance and will report at any time. Zhang Da respectfully reports). It is also heard that the troops stationed in the upper reaches of the Han River are prepared to join forces with various armies on the Fujian-Guangdong border to eliminate the Zhu-Mao bandit forces (16th).</p>
<h3 id="e65">Guangdong Province Resumes Cashing of Five-Yuan Banknotes <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Unlimited Redemption from the 16th of This Month</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence - Since the Guangdong Mint resumed coinage, it has minted no less than 40 million yuan in current coins in a few months. Recently, to reduce the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the factory has prepared to stop minting at the end of this year, and most of the silver coins minted on weekdays will be sent to the Central Bank to replenish the redemption of various uncashed banknotes. The financial authorities believe that the Central Bank has sufficient cash and that there is no fear of being unable to cope once redemption begins. Moreover, with the end of the year approaching, merchants frequently settle accounts, requiring a large number of banknotes. Therefore, it was proposed at a provincial government meeting the other day that redemption of the five-yuan banknotes with Chinese signatures should begin on the 16th of this month. After this news spread, various treasury bills and public bonds rose in price, and the financial market suddenly became active. Yesterday (the 16th) was the date for redemption of the five-yuan banknotes. The Central Bank had previously withdrawn a large amount of cash from the treasury for redemption. At the same time, it also notified the Xidi branch and the Yonghan Road redemption office that all five-yuan banknotes with Chinese signatures would be redeemed without limitation from the 16th. On one hand, the provincial government ordered all agencies that from the 16th onwards, five-yuan banknotes with Chinese signatures were not allowed to be discounted and should be fully accepted. It is heard that the Central Bank and the redemption offices redeemed only a few tens of thousands of yuan in cash yesterday. From 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., no more than a few dozen people went to each location to redeem the banknotes. There are two reasons why so few people came to redeem: 1. Before the resumption of redemption, the market price of the five-yuan banknotes was already above 95 cents, and most citizens did not go to redeem them to save time and effort. 2. With the end of the year approaching, citizens needed a large number of banknotes to settle accounts. There were only more than 2.3 million yuan of these five-yuan banknotes with Chinese signatures circulating in the market, and supply and demand were balanced. Therefore, citizens were happy to use them and did not redeem them. The Central Bank's redemption notice is recorded below: (Now, we have received Directive No. 262 from the Guangdong Provincial Government's Finance Department, along with a proposal from the Governor of this Bank, requesting unlimited redemption of five-yuan Chinese currency from the 16th of this month and asking that various railway bureaus and other agencies be informed to fully accept them, and that the government and national tax agencies be informed separately. We respectfully request a decision. Having received the order to open the document, we have now been approved by the 127th meeting of the 5th Committee of this government. In addition to separately ordering the Finance Department and various railway bureaus, customs, post offices, and other agencies to abide by it and fully accept it, we should also inform the citizens to be aware. Therefore, from the 16th of this month, we will start the full and unlimited redemption of uncashed five-yuan banknotes. The uncashed ten-yuan banknotes and various fifty-yuan banknotes will also be redeemed separately in the shortest possible time to maintain financial stability. In addition to informing the Guangdong Finance Department to announce that the above-mentioned paper money should no longer be traded on the silver market from this date, and that the market should not continue to discount it as before, those who dare to disobey will be severely punished, and we will separately report to the authorities for compliance. We hereby issue a notice for all to be aware (December 17th).</p>
<h3 id="e66">Conclusion of the Hunan Rehabilitation Committee <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>More than 160,000 Yuan Collected in Rehabilitation Donations</p>
<p>Only 42,000 Yuan Advanced for Military Expenses</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence - The Hunan Rehabilitation Committee was established on August 19th of this year, with a fixed term of four months. The initial intention of the association was to imitate the method of collecting military donations set by Yuan Jiapu when he was the director of the Hunan Military Supplies Office in the 13th year of the Republic of China. The association planned to collect rehabilitation donations in the shortest possible time of four months to raise 3 to 4 million yuan as a temporary advance for military expenses and rehabilitation after the great disaster. The committee consisted of 24 members, appointed by He Jian from among the party, government, military, and local gentry in the province. Unexpectedly, after the establishment, things did not go as planned. The people in the province, having suffered repeated disasters, were unable to bear the extra rehabilitation donations, and they requested exemption. In addition, after the establishment, the counties of Nanhua and Jinxiang, which were known to be rich, lost their deadlines for land donations. In addition, Communist bandits raged in Yueyang, Xiangyin, Chaling, Youxian, Liling, and Anren, making it impossible to collect donations. The rest of the counties with wealthy fields and houses mostly fled to Shanghai and Hankou, making it impossible to collect donations. As a result, the income from rehabilitation donations was extremely small. The people of Hunan outside the province strongly opposed collecting donations after the disaster. At the same time, Zhang Jiong, Tan Changkai, Wang Qi, and three other members of the Hunan Provincial Party Department, although they were hired as members of the Rehabilitation Committee, never joined. The party departments of various counties and cities also followed the instructions of the Provincial Party Department and did not support the progress of the rehabilitation donations. Therefore, the results were far from what the authorities had expected. In total, only more than 160,000 yuan in rehabilitation donations were collected in four months, less than two-thirds of the original budget. The provincial government decided to terminate the Rehabilitation Committee as scheduled, as it only gave people a target for attack and did not provide much benefit to the finances. The unfinished matters were transferred to the Finance Department for handling. All uncollected rehabilitation donations in various counties would be the responsibility of the county magistrates and finance bureau chiefs to continue handling, without sending additional personnel. The Rehabilitation Committee then decided to close its doors on December 20th. The plan to allocate 2 million yuan in rehabilitation donations to establish a farmers' bank and 500,000 yuan to subsidize poor people's factories in various counties has become empty talk and there is no money. The case of advancing 2 million yuan for military expenses has, in reality, advanced educational funds of 200,000 yuan, relief funds of 200,000 yuan, and more than 200,000 yuan in rent from Changsha City, which the committee is responsible for withdrawing and advancing for military expenses, and there is currently no money to return. The military expenses advanced from the true rehabilitation donation items were only 42,300 yuan. However, the colleagues on the Rehabilitation Committee believed that the rehabilitation donations would continue to be collected by the Finance Department, regardless of whether they would be able to collect more than 2 million yuan in the future. However, the association must still proceed with the Farmers' Bank according to plan in order to face the people. Therefore, at the last standing committee meeting on the 18th, Peng Zhaohuang, Lei Zhuhuan, Fang Kegang, Zhang Jiong, and Chen Jieshi were selected as members of the Farmers' Bank Preparation Committee, and the Provincial Government was requested to appoint them and allocate 20,000 yuan for preparation expenses, limiting the preparation to be completed within six months before formally establishing it. However, the foundation of 2 million yuan is not yet certain, and it is unknown whether it can be completed as scheduled. As for the Rehabilitation Committee, it stopped working on the 15th to handle the closure. The overall income and expenditure of the association from its establishment on August 19th to December 16th for a period of four months have also been registered and announced (19th).</p>
<h3 id="e67">Martial Law Re-declared in Fuzhou <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence - The transfer of troops from northern Fujian has now been completed and deployments are in place. Lu Xingbang's troops entered Sha County and Yong'an on the 14th. Liu Heding's troops arrived in Yanping on the 15th. Lin Bingzhou and Qian Yuguang's two brigades set out from Gutian on the 15th for Jian'ou and Shaowu. The Provincial Government, considering the provincial capital to be an important rear area with extremely important defense, specially convened a joint meeting of naval, land, military, and police agencies on the 14th, deciding to re-declare martial law from the 16th. Evening traffic is limited to 12 o'clock. Teahouses, restaurants, theaters, and brothels must close after 10 o'clock, and the military police are responsible for patrolling in zones. Checkpoints are set up at important locations. Armed military police are assigned to protect party departments, schools, churches, theaters, and prisons. After schools have winter vacation, students should be ordered to return to their hometowns. Those who cannot return must be supervised by the principals in boarding apartments. Students living in apartments must have a guarantee before they are allowed to live there. Factory workers and drivers must be responsible for filling out a list of names, native places, addresses, and actual guarantees from factory managers and station owners. All wandering artists, both male and female, are deported. Unregistered groups are strictly banned. Collective parades and petitions are prohibited. The dissemination of leaflets and the posting of slogans, as well as the actions of street lectures, are severely punished to maintain local security (December 18th).</p>
<h3 id="e68">Wang Guide's Cavalry Disarmed <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence - The temporarily organized First Cavalry Division of Wang Guide, stationed in the Dongchang and Yanzhou areas, was originally a mixed force, and all its firearms were collected from local militias. Division Commander Wang Guide recently went to Beijing to meet with Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek regarding the division's defense area and military pay, requesting that personnel be sent to inspect the division so that payment could be issued according to the number of troops. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, considering that the division was mostly composed of mixed troops and bandits from various places, believed that incorporation would not only be useless to the country but would also be a burden to the local area. He specifically telegraphed Han Fuqu, the commander-in-chief of the First Army Corps, to disarm and disband the division. After receiving the telegram, Han immediately telegraphed the Rong Guangxing Brigade, stationed in western Shandong, to be responsible for resolving the entire First Brigade of the division stationed near Jining. He also telegraphed the Li Hanzhang Brigade to go to Teng County to resolve the Second Brigade. The division has now been completely and peacefully disarmed. Commander-in-Chief Han has already reported the handling of the situation to the Central Committee and notified his subordinates (19th).</p>
<h3 id="e69">Jinan City Boundary Demarcation <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Telegram: Since Jinan was established as a city in June of last year, disputes with Licheng County over the demarcation of boundaries have persisted for a year. It was not until April of this year that the boundary lines were finally determined: west to Yinmazhuang (18 li from Jinan), north to the Yellow River (12 li from Jinan), east to Xiantongzhuang and Mengjiazhuang, northeast to Xiaojiezhuang, southeast to Longmen Foyu, south to Fenshuiling, and southwest to Zhangzhuang Huangshanling. All of these locations are approximately 30 li from Jinan. Representatives from all sectors of Licheng County, including Zhao Tongyuan, argued that Licheng Puhua was originally located near Jinan, and such a demarcation, completely including it within the urban area, would make it impossible for the county to maintain its finances. They jointly petitioned the provincial government for reconsideration. The provincial government then ordered the Department of Civil Affairs to investigate the matter. The Department of Civil Affairs sent Commissioner Li Weixia to conduct a joint survey with representatives from the municipal government and Licheng County. The results of the survey were that the western and northern boundaries remained unchanged, the northeastern and eastern boundaries were each moved inward by 20 li, and the southeastern, southern, and southwestern boundaries were also each moved inward by 20 li. In total, the municipal boundary was no more than 10 li from Jinan on all sides. Representatives from all sectors of Licheng expressed their approval of this. The provincial government's standing committee also approved the new plan yesterday, and the boundary demarcation issue, which had been in dispute for over a year, was thus resolved. The report from the Secretariat of the Provincial Government is recorded below: 1. According to the Department of Civil Affairs' report, the Supreme Government instructed that the petition from representatives from all sectors of Licheng County, including Zhao Tongyuan, stating that the urban area was too large and requesting a review, etc., should be responded to with a separate report. As instructed, Commissioner Li Weixia was ordered to conduct a joint survey with the city and county and submit a report. Now, according to the commissioner's report, this survey, other than maintaining the western boundary and including all of Beiluokou in the northern boundary, still uses the center of the Yellow River as the boundary. The southeastern and eastern boundaries are contracted inward. The eastern boundary runs south from Jijiazhuang along Qianwangzhuang, the Agricultural and Forestry School, Yinjiazhuang, and Majiazhuang to the Forest Bureau in the southeast as the eastern boundary. The southern boundary runs west from the Forest Bureau along the sunny side of Qianfo Mountain, the sunny side of Ma'anshan, through Wangguzhuang, around Yuanliuzhuang on Baima Mountain, to Renjiashankou as the southern boundary. The new boundaries determined by the joint survey are all based on agreements between the city and county. It is appropriate to submit a map and report for your review and implementation. Please decide how to handle this matter. (19th)</p>
<h3 id="e70">The Difficulties of Post-Situation Management in Shanxi <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Financial Resources and Troops Not Easily Settled</p>
<p>Taiyuan Telegram: The post-situation management of the Shanxi situation has recently seemed to be progressing smoothly as Yan Xishan left Shanxi, and Shang Zhen and Xu Yongchang went to Tianjin to meet with Zhang Xueliang. However, from an objective perspective within Shanxi Province, there are still many difficulties that cannot be resolved in an instant. The depreciation of Shanxi currency has long been a fatal blow to all people in Shanxi. Although the authorities have repeatedly promised to rectify the situation, they have ultimately been unable to do so due to a lack of resources. According to the plan of the newly appointed Director of Finance, Qiu Zengyi, it is planned to proceed in three steps: (1) The provincial bank will first raise 500,000 yuan in silver dollars. The numbers of the banknotes issued by the provincial bank will be mixed up and drawn by lottery each month for redemption. All banknotes that are drawn will be destroyed after redemption. (2) Request the central government to immediately issue the 24 million yuan Shanxi financial reorganization public bond that the National Government had previously approved. If Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan can each sell 4-5 million, and then Shanxi can sell another 4-5 million, then the provincial banknotes can be redeemed immediately with the 20 million yuan in cash raised. (3) If public bonds are not easily sold immediately, use the public bond fund as collateral to borrow some cash to use for monthly lottery redemptions. The above plan has been taken to Tianjin by Shang and Xu to negotiate with Zhang and has also been telegraphed to Beijing for instructions. Although the total amount of banknotes issued by the provincial bank is officially announced as more than 47 million, there are various rumors in society, with some saying more than 70 million and some even saying more than 110 million. Unless you are an insider, it is impossible to know the bottom line. Xu Yiqing, the manager of the provincial bank, and Jia Junchen, the assistant manager, have both resigned one after another. The bank is now in a state of leaderlessness. Before Shang Zhen went to Tianjin, he strongly urged Qiu Zengyi, the Director of Finance, to also serve as manager, but Qiu resolutely refused. This is the financial difficulty. Military affairs are linked to finance. If the financial problem is not resolved, then there is no point in talking about post-military arrangements. The total amount of various revenues in Shanxi Province before the 12th year of the Republic was only more than 12 million. In recent years, they have been keen to collect, but have not yet exceeded 17 million. In recent years, Yan has expanded the military in many ways due to repeated battles, and expenditures have exceeded income. The monthly cost of each army in Shanxi is usually about 200,000 yuan. In addition to local requisitions, the monthly maintenance cost of each army is still no less than 80,000 yuan. If we calculate the total of 245,000 people in the current two or three aspects of the province, as well as the miscellaneous troops of Gao Guizi, Sun Dianying, and Liu Guitang, even if all the monthly income of the province is used to maintain them, it is far from enough. If we talk about mobilizing and reorganizing the troops, the huge cost is even more imaginable. Currently, the armies are still being transferred and deployed. In addition to the units of Wang Jingguo, Fu Zuoyi, Zhao Chengshou, and Li Muyan, which have been transferred to northern Shanxi and Suiyuan, the remaining armies will also move north one after another. The two aspects and miscellaneous armies are still entrenched in the Hedong and Luze areas. Shanxi is originally a poor area and has no ability to support these 200,000 soldiers. Moreover, the armies are mixed together and have different dreams. It is difficult to raise money for reorganization, and it is not easy to find a way out when looking around the four borders for mobilization. This is the military difficulty. Although political problems seem easier to solve, it is still difficult to find people who can satisfy everyone. The general public believes that merchants and farmers are more suitable. However, recently the voices of Shanxi people governing Shanxi have resurfaced. The joint telegram to the central government from the 16 generals of Shanxi and the establishment of the Shanxi Post-Situation Improvement Association by all sectors of China and the West are not without interesting implications.

<h3 id="e71">Post-Situation Management in the Northwest and Yan and Feng Going Abroad <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The Reason Why Zhang Xueliang Has Not Returned to Shenyang</p>
<p>Tianjin Telegram: Zhang Xueliang originally planned to return to Shenyang as soon as possible after his trip to Beijing. He did not expect that after arriving in Tianjin, the issue of post-situation management in the Northwest urgently needed to be discussed, so his departure was repeatedly delayed and he has not been able to make the trip. In recent days, generals from the Yan and Feng factions have come to visit one after another. Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, has also come from Beijing. Based on the situation, it is speculated that Zhang will hardly be able to return in the next few days. Generally, the departure date will be before the Lunar New Year. There are many things in the Northeast waiting for Zhang to deal with, and telegrams have been sent urging him to return. In fact, Zhang Zuoxiang</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>Important News</p>
<p>Has been in office for a long time and must wait for Zhang to return before he can rush back to Jilin to spend the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>Regarding post-situation management in the Northwest, the primary goal is for Yan and Feng to go abroad. Although Yan has been in Tianjin for many days, there is still no definite date for going abroad. Feng's whereabouts are also unknown. Tonight, Song Zheyuan and Pang Bingxun arrived in Tianjin. It is widely rumored that Feng has secretly come in disguise, especially by the Japanese. However, after investigation, it is absolutely not true. The second is the handling of post-situation management in Shanxi and Suiyuan after Yan and Feng leave, as well as the reorganization of the army and the raising of military pay. Zhang has the important responsibility of appeasing the north. At the very least, he must have a considerable solution to the above two matters, so his delay in returning to Shenyang is probably the biggest reason. According to the latest investigation, regarding Yan, the date of departure abroad was first rumored to be the 15th, but then it was rumored to be postponed to the 20th. It is still unknown whether it will be possible to make the trip temporarily. The destination is rumored to be Japan, but some related parties say that he will go to Dalian. When Yan arrived in Tianjin, he had already sent people to Dalian to prepare to rent a house. Recently, it has been rumored that he has bought a house that is being repaired. If so, Yan may stay in Dalian for a long time. As for Feng's mystery, it has never been broken. There are three theories about his whereabouts. When Yan came to Tianjin, it was widely rumored that Feng would pass through Henan and Shandong and go abroad from Qingdao. This theory has now passed and no one talks about it. After Yan arrived in Tianjin, some people said that Feng went to Datong and would transfer to Baotou and Wuyuan. No one knows whether he has left Shanxi and Suiyuan and what his destination is. Tonight, because of the arrival of Song Zheyuan and Pang Bingxun in Tianjin, it is widely rumored that Feng came in disguise. However, this has not been confirmed. Since Yan's departure abroad has not yet been realized and Feng's whereabouts have not been confirmed, it is difficult for Zhang to return to Shenyang immediately. The recent summons of the Yan and Feng generals to Tianjin is ostensibly to instruct them on the reorganization method, but it is also somewhat related to urging Yan and Feng to go abroad. The second is the post-situation management in Shanxi. The so-called post-situation management has no political problems. The problem is the reorganization of the army and the raising of military pay. After Shang Zhen and Xu Yongchang discussed with Zhang in recent days, it is said that in principle, they advocate equal treatment for the army, and the scope of reorganization is based on Shanxi's wealth to support Shanxi's troops. These two points have been roughly agreed upon. However, the details are still unknown to the outside world. The future defense and salary distribution of foreign troops in Shanxi, such as Song Zheyuan's troops, are still to be discussed separately. Song and Pang Bingxun have now arrived in Tianjin, and Sun Dianying will also arrive tomorrow or the day after. Generally, it is not difficult to reach a satisfactory solution. According to Pang Bingxun, Feng's troops currently have about 60,000 people, including Sun Liangcheng's troops of more than 20,000, Song's troops of less than 20,000, Pang's troops of more than 10,000, and Gao Guizi's troops of 6,000-7,000. The most urgent problem to be solved for these 60,000 people is the issue of military pay. If there is a solution to the supply problem, it will be very easy to reorganize and mobilize them.

<h3 id="e72">Establishment of Three Suppression Committees in Jiangxi Province <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Luo and Zhang Have Assumed the Positions of Chairman and Committee Member</p>
<p>Headquarters of the Generalissimo Issues Suppression Regulations</p>
<p>Nanchang Telegram: When Chairman Jiang was in Nanchang, he decided to divide the southwestern region of Jiangxi Province, where banditry was most rampant, into three major bandit suppression and village cleansing areas. Each area would form a suppression committee. Currently, the three suppression committees of Ji'an, Yongfeng, and Le'an have been established one after another. Wei Lin, Zhang Huizan, and Tan Daoyuan have respectively assumed the positions of chairman and committee member and are actively suppressing bandits in accordance with the plan issued by the Generalissimo's Headquarters. The regulations issued by the Generalissimo's Headquarters are recorded below: (1) In order to achieve effective cooperation between the party, government, and military and fundamentally eliminate banditry, suppression committees and village cleansing committees should be established in the bandit suppression areas of Jiangxi Province, which will be guided separately by the Generalissimo's Headquarters and the Jiangxi Provincial Government. (2) In order to concentrate the existing talent and economic resources on eliminating the main force of the communist bandits in Donggu and Shaxi, suppression committees and village cleansing committees should be established in Ji'an, Yongfeng, and Le'an counties. (3) The county governments and county party headquarters in the areas where suppression committees and village cleansing committees are established should accept the command of the committees. (4) Each village cleansing and bandit suppression committee may include nearby counties within its management scope. The scope of the three committees of Le'an, Yongfeng, and Ji'an is temporarily set as follows: (A) Le'an District includes Yihuang, Chongren, Linchuan, Nanfeng, and Guangchang counties. (B) Yongfeng District includes Xiajiang, Xingan, Qingjiang, and Fengcheng counties. (C) Ji'an District includes Jishui, Taihe, and Anfu counties. (5) The village cleansing and bandit suppression committee is composed of the division commander stationed in the area, the chief of staff, the committee member sent to the area by the provincial party headquarters, the captain of the propaganda team sent by the Generalissimo's Headquarters, the county magistrate, and the county party committee member. (6) The division commander serves as the chairman of the committee. (7) The village cleansing and bandit suppression committee meets at least every other day to study the reports collected daily from the military, county government, and county party headquarters, criticize the appropriateness of their actions, guide them to correct their mistakes, effectively direct their activities, and send personnel to conduct practical inspections at any time. (8) The village cleansing and bandit suppression committee should fully guide and assist the county magistrate in carrying out household registration and baojia militia training. (9) If it is necessary to add or expand the management area of the suppression committee, the Generalissimo's Headquarters or the Jiangxi Provincial Government will decide at any time.

<h3 id="e73">Panic Among Merchants and Farmers in Jilin Province <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Calls for Relief Measures</p>
<p>Provincial Order to Banks and Businesses to Provide Loans for Maintenance</p>
<p>Jilin Telegram: The industrial and commercial sectors of this province were previously affected by the Jin Gui incident,</p>
<p>Resulting in Extreme Financial Difficulties. The Provincial General Chamber of Commerce and the General Chamber of Industry jointly petitioned the provincial authorities to instruct various Banks and Businesses to provide loans for assistance. The Bureau of Finance convened a meeting of leaders from the industrial and commercial sectors and decided that the chamber would investigate the required amount and negotiate with various Banks and Businesses. It was expected that the autumn harvest would be approaching, and the market would be active, so the matter was delayed. However, although the harvest was abundant, the only special product that was relied upon to absorb cash and facilitate turnover was very sluggish in sales and showed no signs of loosening. The grain price continued to fall. The reasons were that the needs of various places were greatly reduced due to the abundant harvest, and the general economic relations and transport merchants were suspended. Even the Japanese merchants, who had always been major customers, increased their hesitations and stopped moving forward. In addition to industry and commerce, the farmers were also suffering from low grain prices. Everyone was complaining. Now that the end of the year is approaching, the merchants are in urgent need of money. The General Chamber of Commerce could not bear to sit idly by, so they re-proposed the old matter and requested the issuance of more Harbin currency and ordered various Banks and Businesses to fully lend to relieve the plight. At the end of last month, Chen You presented a petition to the Provincial Government through the Jilin Provincial Chamber of Commerce, calling for prompt approval. The original text roughly stated that (at present, the fields are full of harvested grain and grain carts are gathering. According to the historical situation in Jilin, the prices of various round coins should gradually decrease. However, all Banks and Businesses in Harbin have stopped lending. The financial situation in various commercial ports inside and outside the province is also tight, making it difficult to make ends meet. This has led to the decline of all industries and the increase in the price of money. All these states are not a blessing for the local area. Therefore, we sincerely request the relevant authorities to allow extra support.</p>
<p>Increase the amount of Harbin currency and order all official and commercial Banks and Businesses in various ports to fully understand the situation and fully lend to provide relief and facilitate circulation), etc. After receiving the report, the Provincial Government believed that the difficulty in turnover due to the scarcity of Harbin currency for transactions between various commercial firms inside and outside the province was indeed real. However, increasing the amount of Harbin currency without a reason would destroy the established plan, and it would be difficult to guarantee that the money dealers who control the market for profit would not stir up a financial panic and cause a crisis. Therefore, the first step of the request cannot be approved. However, since various places are in distress, the market is sluggish, the price of money continues to rise, and the grain merchants have no way to retreat, and the commercial and agricultural sectors are at a loss, we must also urgently seek relief. It is appropriate to instruct the official and commercial Banks and Businesses to understand the situation so as to facilitate circulation. Yesterday, the competent authorities have been ordered to forward the order to various Banks and Businesses and directly order the Yongheng Official Bank to comply with the order. At the same time, a consultation will be sent to the Harbin Special Region Commissioner's Office to forward the order to various Banks and Businesses in Harbin to provide sufficient loans to alleviate the urgent need. How to implement it is still under negotiation.</p>

<p>Shenyang Telegram: Since the Bianye Bank of Liaoning Province, the Official Bank of the Three Eastern Provinces, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications jointly established a four-bank reserve in the winter of last year, issuing Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates to circulate in the market, the Liaoning Provincial Government has formulated the Liaoning Provincial Regulations for Financial Management and the Regulations for Prohibiting the Exit of Cash in order to manage the four-bank reserve and reorganize the financial situation of the province. The regulations were submitted to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee for promulgation and implementation. The regulations at that time were mainly established for the reserve, and their provisions referred to the Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates issued by the reserve. This year, the local financial situation is extremely tight. The General Office of the Official Bank of the Three Eastern Provinces submitted a report to the Provincial Government to issue 10 million yuan of Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates in response to market needs, which were issued in two phases. The first phase was 5 million yuan, and it was planned to issue more depending on the need. The content of the previous regulations for financial management was still not comprehensive enough, and the financial situation this year was different from previous years, so it was urgent to revise them to be observed together. The Provincial Government has separately revised the name to the Liaoning Provincial Regulations for Financial Management. The full text of the eleven articles, which were discussed, amended, and passed at the Provincial Government Committee meeting on the 16th of this month, is copied below: (Article 1) In order to standardize finance and prohibit the exit of Silver Dollars, the Liaoning Provincial Provisional Regulations for Financial Management are specifically established. (Article 2) The financial standard in this province is the Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates issued by the Official Bank and the Four-Bank Reserve (hereinafter referred to as the Reserve). (Article 3) After the Official Bank and the Reserve issue Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates in this province, the cash banknotes issued by other banks in foreign ports should be gradually recovered immediately, but the Silver Dollar Certificates of the Bianye Bank that have been approved on a special case basis are not included in this restriction. (Article 4) The Provincial Government will supervise the cash reserve of the Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates issued by the Official Bank and the Reserve at any time. (Article 5) The Silver Dollar Certificates issued by the Official Bank and the Reserve and the Silver Dollars are generally used and must not be discounted. Those who violate this will be severely punished. (Article 6) The Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates issued by the Official Bank and the Reserve can be exchanged for Silver Dollars or Silver Dollar banknotes of the same standard at the exchange offices in the provincial capital. (Article 7) The Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates issued by the Official Bank and the Reserve are permitted to be remitted by merchants and civilians without limitation, and remittance fees may be charged according to the market situation. (Article 8) In order to stabilize the financial situation in this province, it is prohibited to transport Silver Dollars out of the provincial capital. The aforementioned scope of the provincial capital refers to the area under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, that is, the urban area of Shenyang and the commercial port bureau. Going beyond this area is considered leaving the area. (Article 9) Military and police agencies will send people to guard and inspect each customs checkpoint, railway station, and wharf. If anyone is found carrying cash out of the area, the military and police will confiscate the Silver Dollars and turn them over to the government, and impose a penalty for the crime of disrupting the financial situation. A portion of the confiscated funds will be used as a reward, but carrying Silver Dollars less than 100 yuan is permitted and is not restricted. (Article 10) These regulations may be amended at any time if there are any matters not covered. (Article 11) These regulations will be implemented from the date of promulgation. (December 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Suggestions from Wuhu Business Community on Abolishing Li Taxes <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Advocating that Rice Should be Exempt from Taxes</p>
<p>And Requesting Strict Abolition of Regular Customs</p>
<p>Wuhu Telegram: The Ministry of Finance has issued a nationwide telegram deciding to abolish Li Taxes on January 1, 2020. However, it is necessary to carefully plan for the compensation methods after the abolition of Li Taxes. The Ministry of Finance has specially sent commissioners to various provinces to solicit opinions from merchants and civilians. The special commissioner sent to Anhui Province was Zuo Xingjin. After Mr. Zuo came to Wuhu, the General Chamber of Commerce held several meetings to study this matter. Recently, a letter of recommendation has been drafted to respond to the special commissioner and request that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance. The original text is as follows (This time, your committee was ordered to come to Wuhu to investigate the production and sales of special goods and the Li Taxes borne. We accepted the six questions and the investigation form, and we saw the Ministry of Finance's intention to reduce the burden on merchants and accept the opinions of merchants. As for the first question, what are the important bulk products of Anhui Province besides rice? Most of the rice is transported by steamship to Guangdong and Chaozhou, and by sailboat to Jiangsu Province. Taxes are heavy and there are many items. The party and the government attach importance to people's livelihood, and rice should be exempt from taxes. After this abolition of Li Taxes, all rice and wheat transported shall no longer be subject to taxes. This is the first request of the merchants. As for the second and third questions, tea, wood, silk, paper, oil, and porcelain are all from Liuan and Huizhou. Tea Li Taxes are collected by special offices, and cocoon donations are also collected on the spot by special commissioners. They are currently handled by the Anhui Financial and Political Special Envoy Office. The rest, such as wood, paper, oil, and porcelain, all come from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Silk comes from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The total number and name of taxes paid in Anhui Province can be found in the files of the Special Envoy Office and the New Regular Customs. If the above six items are changed to special taxes, they should be collected at the origin and export of the six items of goods. No new tax items should be added in Anhui Province. This is the second request of the merchants. As for the fifth question, what is the best method to compensate after the abolition of Li Taxes? The sixth question asks what is the pain of Li Taxes felt by merchants and how should other taxes be changed to satisfy the wishes of merchants? The abolition of Li Taxes refers to all taxes with the nature of transit taxes, similar to Li Taxes. According to the decision of the Abolition of Li Taxes Meeting in the 18th year, the following should be abolished in addition to Li Taxes: 1. Railway freight donations, 2. Parcel post taxes, 3. Regular taxes and surcharges within 50 miles of commercial ports, 4. Sub-port taxes and surcharges of maritime and land new customs, 5. Re-import taxes and surcharges of maritime and land new customs, 6. Export taxes and surcharges of maritime and land new customs from this port to that port, 7. Regular customs and surcharges within 50 miles of commercial ports. The implementation of the abolition of Li Taxes this time is to complete the unfinished work of the previous Abolition of Li Taxes Meeting. All the original resolutions were based on the requests of the business community and were determined after careful consideration. Now, they should still be the same and all seven items should be abolished in stages. However, the pain of regular customs felt by merchants is no less than that of Li Taxes. Chinese contractors will embezzle profits, and foreign contractors will exploit profits. The inspection is everywhere (the regular customs inspectors wear red belts, and merchants call them red belts). They are like wolves and tigers, and they impose fines on the road for every grain of rice and every chicken. If the customs system is not eliminated, the pain will not end. The regular customs should be abolished at the same time on January 1 next year to eliminate the pain of merchants. This is the third request of the merchants. As for the compensation issue, the Abolition of Li Taxes Meeting divided the items into business tax and special consumption tax. After careful consideration of the advantages and disadvantages, business tax is not as simple and easy to implement as special consumption tax. However, it must be implemented in accordance with the four principles of the Special Consumption Tax Implementation Outline of the previous resolution: (1) One tax for one item, such as returning the cocoon tax after paying the silk tax. (2) After one tax, it is applicable nationwide. (3) The tax amount of the consumption tax changed from the abolition of Li Taxes shall not be higher than the original tax amount. (4) It must be a bulk product within the jurisdiction, otherwise no tax shall be collected. If these four principles can be strictly adhered to, the tax rate will not be changed and the burden will not be increased. This is the fourth request of the merchants. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce suggests that because Jiangxi and Fujian provinces have implemented special consumption taxes, they do not refund the heavy taxes, and goods imported from other provinces that are not sold in the territory are also forced to pay taxes, which is no different from Li Taxes. Only the tax rate is increased, so that merchants do not benefit from the abolition of Li Taxes, but are subject to the determination of the abolition of Li Taxes first. The Ministry of Finance should not allow the above-mentioned malpractices to occur after the abolition of Li Taxes. Our association strongly agrees and should ask your committee to return to the ministry to represent the statement that the change of the tax of this abolition is not comparable to a partial trial of a province. Each province cannot make its own atmosphere. The Ministry of Finance should strictly implement the Implementation of the Special Consumption Tax and its most important one is to strictly abide by the principle of one tax for one item and implement the refund of heavy taxes. Two, in order to facilitate the nationwide circulation after one tax, it should be collected at one time at the place of origin or concentration, and should not be collected in installments. Three, each province should not collect taxes in the name of local taxes. If the pain of the business can be eliminated in this way, the desire will be fulfilled, the business will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate.) (18th)</p>

<p>Having an Affair with a Neighbor, Strangling His Wife</p>
<p>Lu Dabao, the son of a resident of Yantang Village, west of Nan Shuangmiao Bridge in the 15th District (Qingcheng City), is by nature wicked and prone to idleness and womanizing. In the first month of this year, he married a Miss Wang, the daughter of Wang Zhaoxiu, a migrant living nearby, through a matchmaker. After the marriage, quarrels frequently arose between the couple, and he often beat her. Recently, Dabao became infatuated with a woman surnamed Mou from a neighboring village. They became intimate, acting like husband and wife, and he viewed his wife as a thorn in his side. The other night, for some unknown reason, the couple had another argument. Dabao, in a fit of anger, took a hemp rope and strangled Miss Wang to death. Afterwards, Dabao and his father, realizing the enormity of the crime, entrusted someone to negotiate a settlement for 500 yuan as compensation for the death. They contacted Chen Tongkang and Sun Mou, relatives of the deceased in Yuqi Town, and are currently negotiating. However, local people, considering that the case involves human life and daring to settle it privately, are indignant and advocate reporting the case to the county to request an inquest and arrest the murderer to uphold justice and human dignity.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Construction Department Urges the Remittance of the Canal Dredging Mu Tax</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Province's dredging of the Hebei Canal is of great importance. The funding for this dredging project is mainly derived from a two-cent mu tax levied on twenty-five counties in the four prefectures of Jiangbei, Huaiyang, Xuhai. The annual collection amounts to approximately 400,000 yuan, which is not a small sum. However, the county magistrates and directors of the finance bureaus often arbitrarily misappropriate or withhold funds due to local demands, so that only two or three tenths of the amount are actually remitted to the department each year. As a result, the major dredging project has not been able to proceed according to the plans made in the past. Now, during the peak season for land tax collection, a five-part reporting form has been created, modeled after the Construction Funding Management Regulations, and distributed to the county bureaus concerned for completion and submission on a旬 basis to facilitate timely assessment. No delays are allowed. This matter has been submitted to the provincial government for approval and notification to the county magistrates of the twenty-five counties in Jiangbei and Huaiyin to comply with.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Life at Wellesley College (II) <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>(Sent from the United States by Ms. Lu Erzhao of Songjiang)</p>
<p>(III) Student Conditions</p>
<p>(A) Enrollment and General Conditions</p>
<p>All students are female. Naturally, the United States has the most students, followed by England, then Russia and Austria. Among Asian students, the Republic of China, Japan, Korea, and the South Seas Islands are all represented. Currently, there are three Chinese students studying here, and one student each from Japan and other countries. During lectures, all students listen attentively, take notes, and their pens never stop moving. When the professor asks a question, they stand up and answer. However, the most important task is when the teacher questions them, and the most suitable task is self-study and practical experience in the library. If you only rely on a few lecture notes in the classroom, you will never have living knowledge.</p>
<p>During games, ball games, and swimming and other sports to exercise the body, they vigorously develop their personality. Teachers guide them and often take the lead. The students are eager to follow. Each student has a room in the dormitory, and the students take care of their own room decoration (tablecloths, curtains, etc.). The rest of the utensils are provided by the school and are fully equipped. Each room is also equipped with a wireless transmitter to prepare for the study of world-famous musicians, speakers, playwrights, and the sounds, words, and artistic aspects of songs, etc., in order to cultivate the students' temperament, morality, and virtue. American and European students are mostly members of the church and believe in Christ, with their hearts guiding their actions. The greatest result is their spirit of mutual assistance. Erzhao feels their mutual assistance everywhere, at all times, and in everything she does. Reflecting on herself, she feels deeply guilty. Is it a lack of morality? It is actually a difference in habits. This is true of the students, and even more so of the professors. Whenever there is a disaster in the world or personal hardship, they pray together and persuade people to help, doing everything they can as if they were hungry or drowning themselves. Students are young, families are like this, and schools are like this. After graduation, human society will definitely be greatly influenced.</p>
<p>(B) Benefits for New Students</p>
<p>When new students arrive at the school and are not familiar with everything, the senior students must fulfill their obligations and provide sincere guidance. This is a common practice in Western universities. Therefore, the third-year students and the first-year students are called sister classes. After entering the school, one day before the start of classes, the third-year students and the first-year students hold a meeting called the guidance meeting. Students from both grades sit in a circle on the grass, singing, talking, laughing, and discussing the past events of the school, so that the first-year students have something to follow. Thus, the new students become lively. After one or two hours, they forget each other's presence. The new students follow behind the third-year students, dancing and gesturing. The professors also join in at will, especially paying extra attention to foreign students, and sincerely guide them so that they do not suffer the hardships of a foreign country and a foreign school, based on the spirit of loving others.</p>
<p>(C) The Happy Day for Second-Year Students</p>
<p>Every year, one day within a week after the start of school is chosen as the happy day for second-year students. How happy is it? At 5 a.m. on September 23rd, the second-year students wake up the first-year students and order them to wear their clothes inside out, black socks on their feet, and flat hats on their heads. They wrap their hair, necks, and arms in green paper, making everything green (there is a saying in Western countries that first-year college students are green). After dressing up, they serve as servants in the second-year students' bedrooms, sweeping away dust carefully (every two first-year students serve one second-year student, which is an unavoidable duty). After finishing their duties, they go to class as usual after breakfast. However, on this day, wherever first-year students pass second-year students, they must pay their respects and bow to 90 degrees. The second-year students issue an order, and the first-year students obey. When entering the classroom for lessons, the first-year students must carry a pillowcase with their books placed in it, carry it on their shoulders, and hold an umbrella, as if they were Chinese monks carrying tall loads on their shoulders and carrying a musical instrument under their armpits. After 5:30 p.m., they walk slowly on the campus lawn with the group of umbrellas towering high and a mixture of music sounding, following the second-year students. The second-year students issue an order to run, and they start running. They change the order to jump, and they stop and jump. They practice the principle of obeying orders. The second-year students are like despotic monarchs of the Middle Ages. At 6:15 p.m., the monarchs resign, and the first-year and second-year students restore their classmates' spirit of friendship and love, and the class distinctions are removed. This is a common practice in the four national universities, held once a year. Erzhao thinks about it carefully. It is probably to show the glory of promotion and to warn those who stay in the same grade of the great shame. Otherwise, what is the purpose of this childish play?</p>
<p>(D) The Glory and Vigilance of the Graduating Class</p>
<p>September 21st of this year (1930) was the first Sunday after the start of school. All the students went to the chapel happily. The graduating class walked proudly in black robes and square hats. The other classes sat down first, and the music played slowly. Then, the graduating class entered in an orderly manner when the music was melodious and the entire hall was solemnly silent. Each student had a graceful bearing and a charming demeanor, like a celestial being from heaven. If a corner of a graduating student's hat was accidentally folded, the lower-class students would compete to admire it (Erzhao suddenly remembered that Guo Youdao's turban was deliberately folded when he encountered rain, and people folded the corner of their turbans in imitation. From this, we can understand the imitative nature of mankind, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, male and female, old and young. This heart is the same, and this principle is the same. The description of Guo Linzong's biography in the Book of Han and human emotions is extremely valuable). At that time, all eyes were focused on them. From then on, the graduating class worked hard on each course to avoid falling behind. They had a feeling of regret for the rest of their lives. If they did not graduate by this time next year and were still in the graduating class, they would have no place to put their faces. Is this also a subtle way of warning them in the award? As Mencius said, "Teaching is also multifaceted." Is this what he meant?</p>

<h3 id="e88">Inauguration of President Chu Chia-hua of National Central University <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Government Representative Guarantees President Chu's Competence</p>
<p>Chu Chia-hua Takes Full Responsibility for Students' Focused Studies</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM on the 21st, the newly appointed President of National Central University, Chu Chia-hua, arrived at the university to assume his duties. At the same time, an oath-taking ceremony was held in the university's gymnasium. Prior to this, the university had invited representatives from various central government departments and commissions to attend the ceremony. Details of this were reported yesterday. The full details are recorded below:</p>
<p>On the day, attendees included Hu Hanmin, Dai Jitao, He Yingqin, Sun Wenben, Shao Yuanchong, Wang Zhongwu, Chen Yi, Ma Hetian, Chen Danian, and several dozen others. All faculty, staff, and students of the university were present. At 8:30 AM, after the ceremony was conducted with due formality, Hu Hanmin, representing the Central Party Headquarters, presided over the oath-taking. Chu Chia-hua raised his right hand and recited the oath.</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin's Address: Hu Hanmin delivered an address stating that today marks the inauguration of President Chu, and he felt that generally, the public thought that education in the Republic of China had progressed slowly over the past few decades, with frequent instability within schools. Some attributed this to the negative influence of the government and the disruptive activities of reactionaries and rebels everywhere. Others blamed it on the incompetence of those in charge of education and the lack of a correct direction for education. The most precious time for a person is their time in school. The late Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "(The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades must continue to strive for China's freedom and equality)." If a country's material civilization has progressed but its spiritual civilization remains backward, its international standing cannot be improved. When the people of a country make discoveries in academics, it indicates the level of civilization of that country. Therefore, equality in academic culture is true equality. The shame of our nation being despised by the nations of the world can only be washed away by the academic efforts of young people. The late Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "(One must have great ambition, study diligently, and specialize to achieve great things)." University students bear a heavy responsibility for building China. Among China's 400 million people, those who are illiterate account for 80 percent. Of the remaining 20 percent, those who can receive a university education are only one in ten thousand. Therefore, students have exceptional opportunities in society, and the responsibilities they will bear in the future are greater than those of anyone else. President Chu has had success in running Sun Yat-sen University. Today, I heard a representative of Sun Yat-sen University students ask me, "Why did the central government transfer President Chu from Sun Yat-sen University to National Central University? Why is the central government so generous to Central University and so stingy to Sun Yat-sen University?" I believe that Sun Yat-sen University already has a considerable foundation and achievements, so President Chu was transferred to lead Central University. President Chu previously conducted in-depth research on natural sciences at the University of Berlin in Germany. He has also achieved success in running Sun Yat-sen University and overseeing civil affairs in Zhejiang Province. After taking over as President of National Central University, he will definitely make significant contributions in both school administration and academics. At the same time, President Chu is also a believer in the Three Principles of the People. In the future, he will educate and cultivate true talents for the construction of the Party and the country in accordance with the Three Principles of the People, making National Central University the best university in the country, which is something to be congratulated.</p>
<p>Dai Jitao's Address: Dai Jitao delivered an address on behalf of the National Government,</p>
<p>Stating that his views regarding President Chu's inauguration, based on past experience and feelings, would be simply presented to everyone. The life of a university is permanent and continuous. The oldest universities in China are only more than 30 years old (excluding those run by foreigners). National Central University is relatively young. It is hoped that National Central University will have a history of thousands of years. The lifespan of a university is the lifespan of human culture. Those who run universities should understand this point. Running a university is a permanent endeavor that should move towards the long-term future. Beautiful flowers and verdant branches are only temporary beauty and cannot be maintained permanently. Those who run universities should work diligently and not easily change their views according to temporary trends. He had been a university president for four years and was ashamed that he could not do it for life. However, he still has the responsibility to help develop Sun Yat-sen University. Those who run universities and students should consider this permanent life and not be moved by temporary beauty. Everyone should have a spirit of love, sincerity, and cooperation to create a long and bright history for Chinese universities. These were his simple opinions for everyone and President Chu.</p>
<p>Chen Danian's Address: Chen Danian delivered an address on behalf of the Executive Yuan, stating that the period of destruction in China has passed, and we are now in the period of political tutelage. The construction of the political tutelage period depends on the efforts of young people to explore advanced knowledge and cultivate true talents for construction. Therefore, the Executive Yuan issued an order to rectify academic style, which is for this purpose. President Chu's knowledge and morality will enable National Central University to shoulder this important mission, and so on.</p>
<p>Sun Wenben's Address: Sun Wenben delivered an address on behalf of the Ministry of Education, stating that National Central University has a relatively excellent position and a solid foundation among national universities, with a good academic atmosphere. It shoulders three missions for the country: (1) To promote the study of advanced knowledge and cultivate true scholars. (2) To cultivate outstanding members of society and lead society. (3) To promote Party ideology and cultivate talents for the construction of the Three Principles of the People. It is hoped that President Chu will base himself on these three major missions to create this ideal university. After Sun's speech,</p>
<p>Shao Yuanchong's Speech: Shao Yuanchong delivered a speech on behalf of the guests, saying that we must not be complacent and must constantly seek knowledge. Knowledge is the experience left by our predecessors. The mission of education is to use scientific methods to organize this experience so that it can be used to benefit life. Schools are places for imparting knowledge, and students should recognize and study a discipline diligently to cultivate specialized talents for construction. The progress of Chinese culture is very slow and is often looked down upon by the West, resulting in a far behind international position. In the future, to achieve international equality, we must express ourselves culturally, and the responsibility for this rests on you all. He hoped that students would bury themselves in books and do solid academic work to promote our country's inherent culture and transform world culture.</p>
<p>Chu Chia-hua's Reply: Finally, Chu Chia-hua delivered a reply, stating that in the future, he would sincerely accept everyone's instructions and the responsibilities entrusted to him by the government and do his job conscientiously. The president's responsibility is great, and his ability is limited, but the government's expectations for National Central University are very high, so he feels very apprehensive. National Central University bears a great responsibility for the independence of the Chinese nation and the revival of its culture. The central government wants to cultivate leaders of advanced knowledge, so it runs universities. Universities are often the center of a country's politics and culture. The late Dr. Sun Yat-sen invented the bright path of the Three Principles of the People based on science and various world knowledge. Therefore, our school should follow the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings to create true peace and a world of great harmony. From personal experience, there are uneconomical aspects in various domestic universities, resulting in a lack of learning tools. Although European and American universities have a history of several decades, they are still very economical in their use of funds and actively expand equipment and books. European and American universities often have only one lecturer in a department, and assistant teachers are also very few. In China, this is considered strange, while in foreign countries, the results are amazing. Department store-style universities in our country are very dangerous for the future of national academics and cause concern. In the future, when running this school, we should adhere to ideal standards and practical possibilities, strive to save expenses, expand equipment, and create a stable and fulfilling environment conducive to academic research. This cannot be achieved overnight or by the efforts of one person. It is hoped that everyone will work together with one heart and one mind to achieve this. National Central University was formed from the reform of Nanjing Higher Normal School and National Southeastern University. It has a history of 20 years. All the achievements in running the school and the spirit of service of graduates in society have been heard to some extent. Unfortunately, there has been instability in the school recently, which is very regrettable. You will soon leave school and serve in society. The precious time for studying is very short. It is hoped that you will cherish the time you spend at school and no longer be distracted by external affairs, causing factional disputes within the school. The progress of the school is to provide a stable environment for you to study in peace. He has a responsibility for the educational policy and school administration. How to enable you to acquire advanced knowledge so that you can strive for society in the future is even clearer and more practical than your parents. In the future, he will do his best to assist you in achieving the ultimate goal of university. At the beginning of his taking office, he was not yet clear about the internal affairs of the school, and a concrete plan for improving school affairs could not be discussed for the time being. The above is just a temporary feeling. After the speech, the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>To ensure that all children in the city receive education in eight years.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Government, in view of the large number of out-of-school children in Hangzhou, as revealed by a recent survey of over 20,000, this phenomenon is due to the urban social recession, and also due to insufficient education funding. Therefore, a plan has been specially formulated to increase education funding year by year over eight years to ensure that all children in the city receive compulsory education. According to the plan, the total education funding for the 20th year of the Republic is 424,640 yuan, with 27,406 children in school and 20,000 children out of school. From the 21st year of the Republic, education funding will be increased by 70,000 yuan each year, reducing the number of out-of-school children by 3,000. By the 27th year of the Republic, the total education budget will be 883,840 yuan, with 48,000 children in school and no children out of school.</p>

<p>Three Directors of Education Bureaus and Six Directors of Mass Education Centers</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education has recently made many changes to personnel in the education departments of various counties and cities. The newly appointed personnel are recorded below: Directors of Education Bureaus: Qing Jin Tai (Wukang), Bai Ying (FenShui), Zhao Mingcheng.

<h3 id="e92">The Provincial Department of Education Orders Yangzhou Middle School Not to Exceed the Budget for Construction <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Department of Education previously received a request from Yangzhou Middle School to use the surplus of 17,000 yuan from the accommodation fees of the 17th and 18th years of the Republic to build an auditorium and a science hall. This was approved, and the school was ordered to submit a detailed budget for review. However, several months passed without the plan being submitted. Yesterday, it was reported that the bids received exceeded the budget by more than double. The Department of Education believes that the school did not follow the original plan, and since the provincial education funds for the 19th year of the Republic are very tight, it is impossible to allocate additional funds to cover the construction shortfall. It has already instructed the school to follow the previous order and find ways to reduce the project within the existing budget. The original order is recorded below:</p>
<p>The submission and attachments have been reviewed. Previously, the school president requested to use the surplus of accommodation fees from the 17th and 18th years of the Republic and the temporary fees from the 18th year of the Republic to build an auditorium, classrooms, and laboratories, stating that the estimated price was close to the total amount of the surplus. The Department approved the use of the 17,000 yuan surplus as the total amount of the school's temporary fees for the 19th year of the Republic and ordered that a comprehensive plan be made within this range for all necessary construction and equipment and submitted for approval and implementation. However, the school president did not comply with the order to submit the plan for review and instead invited merchants to bid. It is now reported that the bids received exceeded the original budget by more than 20,000 yuan, which is clearly inconsistent with the original plan. As for the temporary fees for the 19th year of the Republic, the 22nd meeting of the Education Funding Committee decided that temporary fees should be temporarily postponed until the provincial education funds are insufficient to pay regular expenses. Therefore, the request to allocate temporary fees for the 19th year of the Republic will be temporarily set aside by the Department. The school is still required to follow the previous order and find ways to reduce the project within the existing budget and report the handling situation for record. The attachments will be temporarily stored here.</p>

<p>Among the matches, the battle between Yiming Bing and Shi Bing was the most moving. Yiming Bing had been invincible, and Shi Bing had been unstoppable. Only last week, the score was tied with Zhong Bing. Yesterday was the final match, and the championship would be decided in this one game. On the battlefield, Yiming Bing immediately launched an attack. Center Yue Renli fought alone, breaking through the camp and successfully scoring the first goal, which won applause from the audience. Continuing the melee, Shi Bing's momentum gradually increased, and their midfielder also scored a goal, tying the score. In the second half, Yiming Bing knew that the enemy could not be underestimated, and the three forwards launched a full-scale attack. Left forward Ding Bingkun received the support of the center and flipped over to score a goal. Yue Renxiao followed up with another goal, greatly boosting morale. Shi Bing desperately counterattacked and also scored two goals, again tying the score. Yiming Bing was deeply afraid of losing the victory, so they desperately advanced, and Yue Renxiao showed his power again, using his nimble and lively skills and experience on the battlefield to strike hard again, scoring two goals, thus winning the Jian'er group championship with a score of five to three. In general, although Shi Bing's talent was very organized, the connection between the front and rear lines, the agility of the movements, and the accuracy of the shots were far inferior to Yiming Bing's. The winning of the championship was not accidental.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Arbitration Results of the Pawn Industry Labor Strike Yesterday <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>All Employees Receive Graded Pay Raises</p>
<p>Both Parties Sign Agreement for Immediate Resumption of Work Today</p>
<p>Over Two Hundred Workers Petitioned the Party Headquarters Together</p>
<p>After the pawn industry workers' strike entered its fourth day, representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters' Public Training Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau convened labor and management representatives yesterday afternoon at the Party Headquarters for mediation. The result was that all pawn industry employees were divided into three grades (A, B, and C) and received universal pay raises. The management also recognized the workers' union's right to represent its members. Both parties signed an agreement, and the striking workers are scheduled to fully resume work today. During the mediation, over two hundred workers marched to the Party Headquarters to petition. On their way, passing Wansheng Bridge in Ximen, they saw that Cuiyuan Pawnshop was open for business. The crowd knocked down its signboard and urged it to close. Yesterday, over one hundred labor unions across the city held a meeting to discuss providing assistance to the three workers who were previously sentenced by the court. They decided to bail them out today and file an appeal. The details of each situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Mediation Situation</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Yesterday afternoon at 1 p.m., labor and management representatives from the pawn industry, following the instructions of the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau, each sent responsible representatives to the Public Training Committee of the Party Headquarters to await mediation. The attendees included: (A) From the Municipal Party Headquarters' Public Training Committee: Tao Baichuan (representative for mediation), from the Social Affairs Bureau: Guo Yongxi (representative for mediation), Shi Shaohua (recorder). (B) From the labor side: Jin Futian, Cheng Zijun, Wang Ganchen, and Cheng Xingzhu (responsible representatives); Li Fulin and Hu Jinzhang were present as observers. (C) From the management side: Cheng Rufu, Yu Shaoqing, Shen Fuzhi, Wu Jiemei, Mu Jingshan, and Yu Langxi (responsible representatives). They were seated separately in the east side of the reception room on the ground floor of the Municipal Party Headquarters.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After the labor and management representatives were assembled, Tao Baichuan from the Public Training Committee and Guo Yongxi from the Social Affairs Bureau, acting as chairmen, began with a report from Tao Baichuan. He stated that all representatives present were expected to be fully responsible representatives. This dispute in the pawn industry originally fell within the scope of mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau. However, because worker organizations and employee groups have similar natures, the Labor-Management Dispute Resolution Law was not applicable for mediation or arbitration. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau had no legal basis for mediation, and the Party Headquarters convened both parties to discuss solutions on the twelfth of this month, in order to prevent the dispute from escalating. On that day, the three management representatives believed that the matter was important and needed to wait until after the general meeting of all members of the trade association on the fifteenth before proceeding with negotiations. The Party Headquarters thought this approach was reasonable, so it rescheduled the formal mediation for the seventeenth. Unexpectedly, the labor representatives arrived on the seventeenth and waited from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., but the management representatives did not appear, making mediation impossible. This led to the strike on the eighteenth. It can be said that this strike by pawn industry workers was entirely caused by the issue of revising the contract. If the management representatives had come to mediate on the twelfth or seventeenth, the strike would not have occurred. The responsibility for this is very clear and should be borne by the management. Today, both parties are here, and it is hoped that everyone will openly and honestly discuss amending the contract so that the turmoil can be calmed down as soon as possible, etc. After the Chairman's report, the labor representative Wang Ganchen stood up and said that the management representative Yu Langxi was an outsider and had no right to attend. The chairman ordered him to stop speaking.</p>
<p>Amended Conditions: After discussions by both parties, the mediation was completed at 8 p.m., and the formal agreement was signed. The striking workers, under the order of the workers' union, will uniformly resume work starting this morning. The amended conditions are copied below: Agreement between the Shanghai Pawn Industry Association, the Special District Pawn Industry Association, and the Pawn Industry Workers' Union of Shanghai: Article 1 (Recognition): The Shanghai Pawn Industry Association and the Special District Pawn Industry Association recognize the right of the Pawn Industry Workers' Union to represent its members who have joined the union. Article 2 (Salary): Each pawn industry employee's monthly salary will be increased by 1.5 yuan for those earning 15 yuan or more, 3.5 yuan for those earning 10 yuan or more, and 5.5 yuan for those earning less than 10 yuan. Counter clerks will receive a double salary in December, uniformly at 10 yuan per person per month. Article 3 (Bonus): Each pawnshop should announce its annual business situation at the end of each year. If there is a surplus, after deducting official profits and expenses, 20% or 30% of the remaining profit will be allocated (20% if the agreed-upon profit is 8%). Article 4 (Commission): The commission charged by each pawnshop is stipulated as 2%. Any amount exceeding this should be retained. Article 5 (Allowance): The allowance for supplementing income from the old conditions should be abolished. However, allowances for special circumstances should still be retained.

Outsiders should not be hired to fill the vacancy unless absolutely necessary. Article 7 (Dismissal): Employees of any pawnshop should not be dismissed without major fault. If dismissed, they must be paid the usage due to them and appropriate travel expenses. Article 8 (Closure): If a pawnshop owner closes the business for any reason and dismisses employees, each employee must be paid a dismissal fee of 300 yuan, and the full usage should be calculated based on the existing inventory. However, if the losses are too great, the amount may be reduced. Before the pawnshop is dissolved, the management should pay double the salary. Article 9 (Working Hours): The daily working hours of each pawnshop employee should not exceed nine hours, except on New Year's Eve (the time should be determined according to the customs of each pawnshop's area). Article 10 (Leave): Each pawnshop employee should have two months of paid leave per year. In the event of a wedding or funeral, leave may be taken at any time. Article 11 (Pension): If an employee of any pawnshop dies due to illness, the management must provide a pension based on the years of service.

For those who have served for more than ten years, 120 yuan will be given, with the position retained for six months. For those who have served for more than fifteen years, 160 yuan will be given, with the position retained for eight months. For those who have served for more than twenty years, 240 yuan will be given, with the position retained for one year. Those who sacrifice their lives on duty will be given a preferential pension. The benefits they were entitled to before their death and during the retention period must still be calculated and paid. Article 12 (Insurance): If employees have clothes and items, the pawnshop owner should provide insurance. This does not apply to uninsured items in the pawnshop.

Representative of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau: Guo Yongxi. Recorder: Shi Shaohua.</p>
<p>Workers' Petition</p>
<p>Marching in Formation: Apart from the survey team, special team, maintenance team, transportation team, and personnel in charge of documentation, publicity, and general affairs who continued to work as usual, the remaining 200+ workers at the union assembled at the union hall at 1 p.m., divided into four teams led by team leaders Qian Huanying, Weng Kangfu, etc., and marched to the Party Headquarters to petition. Each person wore the workers' union symbol for identification. The team leaders held white flags in their hands. They marched in an orderly fashion, two abreast, before and after each other, through the streets, maintaining strict formation.</p>
<p>Losses at Cuiyuan: As the petitioning workers marched in formation to Wansheng Bridge south of Old West Gate, they saw that Cuiyuan Pawnshop was open for business as usual. Believing this to be a sabotage of the strike, the workers swarmed forward and knocked down one of the signboards hanging in front of the shop, and urged it to close. Subsequently, the manager came out and admitted that they would close immediately and promised not to open again during the workers' strike. The workers then re-formed and continued to the Municipal Party Headquarters. Upon arriving at the Party Headquarters, they stood in a row and shouted slogans such as "Support Workers' Representatives" and "Request the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau to Uphold Justice and Alleviate Labor Oppression." Despite the freezing wind and light rain, the workers stood upright on the wet ground in front of the Party Headquarters until the mediation concluded late at night before returning. Written Petition: While the conditions were being discussed and amended inside, the workers remained outside as it was inconvenient for them to enter. Therefore, they submitted a written petition, which stated: "We petition regarding the following matter. Because of the movement for better conditions, the management has consistently ignored us, forcing us to declare a strike on the eighteenth to awaken the management. The details have been reported to your esteemed headquarters, and we are grateful that your esteemed headquarters has specifically convened labor and management for mediation today. It has been four days since we went on strike, and the spiritual and financial losses are immeasurable. Moreover, in this severe weather, the impact on the economy of ordinary people is significant. Upon hearing that your esteemed headquarters had convened a mediation, the members were overjoyed, believing that our plight could be resolved and our poverty alleviated. However, we are mindful that the management is cunning by nature, and we fear that today's meeting will be another false hope. Therefore, we have specially organized a petitioning group to implore your esteemed headquarters to strictly order the management to reach a satisfactory resolution today so that the strike can be brought to an end today. It is not only the labor and management sides that will benefit from this. We are unable to express the urgency of our prayers and sincerely present this to the Public Training Committee of the Municipal Party Headquarters of the Chinese Nationalist Party, from the entire membership of the Pawn Industry Workers' Union of Shanghai."</p>
<p>Labor News</p>
<p>Prosecution: On the afternoon of the nineteenth, the four workers who were arrested by the Harbin police for advising Hexiang Pawnshop in East Jiaxing Road to close were transferred to the court. Cheng Guangzu, Wang Junyan, and Shao Chunsheng were sentenced to three weeks of detention. They declared their dissatisfaction and filed an appeal. The workers' union hired lawyers Yang Zhihao and Zhuang Yingxun to draft the appeal. However, due to it being Sunday yesterday, it was decided to first bail out the three sentenced individuals today and then file an appeal. As the three are currently detained in the Harbin police station, it is feared that the cold weather will cause them to become ill.</p>
<p>Union Assistance: Yesterday, representatives from the Sanyou Industrial Society Labor Union, Xia Zhongzhao, the Gold and Silver Foil Industry Labor Union, Liu Panchou, Wu Buyan, the Umbrella Industry Labor Union, Sheng Qingtong, the Western-Style Furniture Industry Labor Union, the Jiaxing Pawn Industry General Labor Union, and the Express Mail Telegraph, among others, sent their condolences. Over one hundred labor unions throughout Shanghai held a meeting at the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union yesterday afternoon at 1 p.m. to discuss providing assistance to the pawn industry striking workers. They resolved to: (1) Convene a city-wide labor representative conference on Thursday to organize a support association; (2) Jointly petition the Municipal Party Headquarters to earnestly order the management to amend the conditions; (3) Discuss the issue of the existence and abolition of the workers' union. The Joint Federation of Various Industries also issued a declaration.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Workers at Zhabei Chinese Merchants Public Bus Company on Slowdown Yesterday <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Workers Demand Year-End Bonus</p>
<p>Ineffective Negotiation Between Both Parties</p>
<p>Although Bus Operated Normally Yesterday</p>
<p>Passengers Didn't Have to Buy Ticket</p>
<p>The crowdedness on Zhabei Chinese Merchants Public Bus, which runs between North Station, Jiangwan, Zhenru, etc., was rarely seen yesterday. All buses on various routes were fully loaded with passengers, crowded and impenetrable. Those who saw it thought it was a prosperous business, surpassing the past. However, the company side was at a loss, with worry written all over their faces. The reason why there were so many passengers was actually the result of the workers' slowdown, not the so-called booming business. Even worse, although the buses operated normally, the company not only had no income but also had to compensate for gasoline, tires, repairs, and other expenses, causing significant losses to the company. This is truly a unique aspect of the slowdown.</p>
<p>Slowdown Situation: Zhabei Public Buses usually start operating at 6 a.m. to carry passengers. Yesterday morning, the workers all arrived at the factory to work as usual, just like any other day, and all 26 buses on routes 1, 2, and 3 were dispatched. However, at around 7 a.m., they suddenly started the slowdown in unison. The ticket seller at the Baoshan Road intersection first put the tickets into the collection box and stopped issuing tickets. The buses operating on various routes also allowed passengers to board without buying tickets. The ticket sellers stood by with their hands in their sleeves, mingling with the passengers. Therefore, on the surface, no one knew that the public bus workers had slowed down.</p>
<p>Buses Were Crowded: Yesterday it rained. Even if the public buses on various routes were not on slowdown, the number of passengers would certainly be more than usual. However, after the news spread that the workers were on slowdown and passengers did not have to buy tickets, the number of passengers on each bus suddenly increased. Even those who had no intention of taking the bus boarded with the crowd. Each bus was stipulated to carry only 32 people, but now the number of passengers was at least 40 or 50, and some even doubled. The company side, upon learning of this, was deeply afraid that excessive loading would inevitably cause an accident, so they notified the police station to pay attention along the way. The company's losses yesterday were approximately 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Workers' Demands: The reason for the workers' slowdown was the demand for a year-end bonus and uniforms. The details are as follows: The Zhabei Chinese Merchants Public Bus Company has a total of 26 buses, divided into three routes: (Route 1) 11 buses running from Baoshan Road intersection to Jiangwan; (Route 2) 4 buses running between Qiujiang Road, Sichuan Road, and Xinzha Bridge; (Route 3) 11 buses running from Baoshan Road intersection to Zhenru and beyond. The three routes have more than 100 drivers and ticket sellers working in early and late shifts. On October 24, the workers held a meeting and resolved to demand that the company issue a year-end double salary and winter uniforms. On October 25, the workers' union submitted the request to the company. The company's reply stated that it was still too early to discuss year-end bonuses and that there would be a solution in the future. As for the winter uniforms, if thick woolen fabric was required, the cost would be borne half by the company and half by the workers. As a result, there was no outcome. Later, requests continued until the 17th of this month, seven times in total, but ultimately there was no progress.</p>
<p>Negotiation Process: After the 17th of this month, the majority of the workers advocated for a slowdown. Huang Zhongwen, the director of the company's transportation department, reported the workers' plan to the company authorities and began negotiations. The company then appointed Ren Zuojun as its representative to negotiate with the workers. As a result, the workers originally demanded a year-end double salary, with a minimum of 25 days of double pay per month. The company side's highest limit was to issue 15 days of bonus pay and could not increase it further. Thus, the negotiations were suspended and the two sides broke down. At 10 p.m. the night before last, the workers gathered at the workers' union to hold a meeting and resolved that all drivers and ticket sellers would uniformly slow down as a final demand, and petitioned the relevant Sixth District Party Headquarters, the Municipal Party Headquarters Public Training Committee, the Social Affairs Bureau, and other agencies to request mediation.</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Investigation: After the bus workers' slowdown, at 8:30 a.m., representatives Liang Guoming and Liu Shouchun were dispatched to the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition and reported the details of the slowdown. At 4 p.m., the Municipal Party Headquarters sent Zhou Funong as its representative to investigate everything at the Chinese Merchants Bus Workers' Union. The result was that the matter was of great importance, and the Municipal Party Headquarters would, together with the Social Affairs Bureau, send representatives to the company to conduct mediation tomorrow morning (today). The workers side decided at a meeting yesterday afternoon to continue the slowdown today. If the company prevents the buses on all routes from leaving the factory in the morning, they will report to the Public Security Bureau, claiming that the management is obstructing traffic and demanding that the Public Security Bureau ensure the safety of the workers, etc.</p>
<p>Company's Attitude: According to the company's statement, there are currently over 160 employees, with the monthly salary of drivers ranging from 25 yuan to 49 yuan, ticket sellers from 20 yuan to 24 yuan, and ticket inspectors from 35 yuan to 39 yuan. An additional salary increase of three days is added each month, and a bonus is calculated every six months. Any worker who has not committed any misconduct in six months can receive a bonus ranging from 30 yuan to 40 yuan. On average, 90% of the workers can receive this bonus. As for the issue of only allowing the issuance of a 15-day year-end bonus this time, it is because the company's finances this year have been greatly affected by the Jin Hui exchange rate, leading to high material costs and making it difficult to make ends meet. Even issuing a 15-day year-end bonus is a strain. However, because the two sides were unable to reach an agreement, the workers used the slowdown as a form of resistance. However, the union did not submit a request to the higher authorities for mediation in advance. They suddenly slowed down and arbitrarily drove the buses without stopping, collecting fares, or even freely entering the factory. The company has no way to stop this and can only await the authorities' disposition.</p>
<p>Labor's Petition: Yesterday, the Public Bus Workers' Union submitted a petition to the Sixth District Party Headquarters, the Municipal Party Headquarters Public Training Committee, and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting mediation. The petition stated: "In order to report on the management's refusal to give a year-end double salary and all unreasonable oppression, we request that you promptly send personnel to mediate and prevent a major dispute between labor and management. It is our understanding that a year-end double salary is a common practice in all shops and factories throughout the country, and it is also the compensation that employers should provide. How prosperous an enterprise is in a year depends mostly on the labor of the workers. Therefore, labor and management have such a major and close relationship. There should be appropriate compensation for a year's hard work, which can not only encourage workers but also have a significant impact on business. Therefore, employers must uphold the spirit of labor-management cooperation and should automatically issue a year-end double salary without waiting for the workers' request. This can encourage workers and promote business development. However, the company is cunning by nature and uses all means of oppression without any sincerity in seeking labor-management cooperation. We will now present one or two examples to your department: (1) Uniforms are supposed to be issued by the company for both winter and summer. The company has requested that the union follow up on this year's winter uniforms. The company used a very cheap and thin fabric to make the winter uniforms. The fabric sample was viewed by all the workers, who believed that the uniforms represent the company and the spirit of the workers. The fabric sample proposed by the company was not only insufficient to enhance appearance but also insufficient to keep warm. The entire workforce objected, and after negotiation by the union, it was stopped. The company was then asked to make thick woolen uniforms, but the company firmly refused. After repeated negotiations by the union, they agreed to make woolen fabric, but the cost of the uniforms would have to be shared by the workers and deducted from their salaries. All members of the union, as the weather is getting colder and colder, cannot bear the cold in their summer uniforms. If they wear their own clothes, it is not allowed by the regulations, which is very harmful to their health. They had to reluctantly agree. As of today, the winter uniforms have not yet been put on. In China and foreign countries, employers provide uniforms, but the Chinese Merchants Public Bus Company is opening a new precedent. This shows that the company is using every means possible against its workers. (2) Regarding the year-end double salary, in October of this year, union members sent letters to the union requesting that the union ask the company to issue two months' salary. The union members found that factories, companies, and transportation businesses in the Zhabei area of Shanghai had been offering as much as three months, two months, one month, and even borrowing an additional month. Therefore, the request for two months was carefully discussed at the fourth general meeting on October 24 of this year, and it was decided that the time was not right to examine the situation of the company in the spirit of pure labor-management cooperation. After deliberation, it was decided to reduce the request to one month and sent representatives to the company to request it on October 25 of this year. The company replied that it was still too early and that the company was also considering the period, and that there was no fixed rule for issuing one month or even two months. The union representatives told all members that the company's reply would be able to meet the hopes of all workers, and all members were satisfied with this reply. Unexpectedly, the company intended to prevaricate. It has now been five or six times that they have requested the company, and the company first responded that it should be on the 12th, then the 17th, and finally the 15th. This erratic change is too different from the requirements of all employees, and the company's talks are not sufficient to gain the trust of the workers. Therefore, all employees are extremely angry and are eager to take the most serious measures against the company. The union, considering the company's business relationship, made every effort to facilitate transportation and should be responsible for negotiating with the company again to achieve the goal of all workers. However, the workers are approaching the end of the year and cannot wait. They have been questioning the union every day. Therefore, the union sent representatives to the company again yesterday for a final negotiation, but the company firmly insisted on 15 days, which is still far from the requirements of all workers, and as a result, there was no outcome. Therefore, the workers became even more angry upon hearing this, and decided to take countermeasures. As the union believes that the matter is of great importance and cannot bear this heavy responsibility, in addition to trying to persuade and stop them within the past two days, we are hereby presenting this petition to request your department to promptly send personnel to mediate in order to avoid a major dispute and ensure the people's expectations are met. We are extremely grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Sixth District Party Headquarters, the Municipal Party Headquarters Public Training Committee, and the Social Affairs Bureau of the Chinese Nationalist Party. Shanghai Chinese Merchants Public Bus Workers' Union."</p>

<h3 id="e107">Liquor Store Labor Strike Escalates <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Declared Strike Yesterday</p>
<p>The liquor store employees in this city have been under pressure from the Second District Baijiu Tax Collection Office, which has nearly led to a slowdown. Yesterday, because the Tax Collection Office had not yet responded, they officially declared a strike. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Negotiation Process: Yesterday, following the resolution, the trade association dispatched representatives Huang Yuming, Zhang Guanshou, and Shi Youqing to negotiate with the Tax Collection Office. However, the director of the office, Li Guangzhen, knowing he was in the wrong, avoided meeting them. The assistant director, Zhu Houfu, received them, but Mr. Zhu stated that he had no authority to respond and could not negotiate. The three representatives had no choice but to withdraw without any results.</p>
<p>Declaration of Strike: After the management representatives reported the situation, the workers at the union were indignant. They believed that only a strike would warn the Tax Collection Office. Therefore, they immediately issued an order declaring a strike. The membership meeting was held at 2 p.m. yesterday, the fifth general membership meeting. Hu Guzhen was elected chairman, and the formalities were performed. First, the chairman reported that the negotiations with the Tax Collection Office had been insincere in accepting their demands, so he immediately declared a strike. Then, they began to discuss: (1) After the strike, all employees must strictly abide by order and not go out under false pretenses.

<p>Unstable Foreign Exchange Market</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau announced the foreign exchange rates for the month.

<p>Mr. Song Zi-Liang, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Director of the Dredging Bureau, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. A reporter from the Guomin News Agency happened to meet him at a friend's house. Mr. Song said that the dredging of the Suzhou Creek will be implemented soon. He has consulted with business leaders regarding the dredging of the Wusong River mouth and it has been decided that about two large dredging vessels will be required, each costing 2 million yuan. These funds are planned to be obtained from foreign vessels entering the port by appropriately increasing the dredging fee for foreign vessels. If this plan is successful, the largest merchant ships will be able to enter and exit the Wusong port, which will greatly contribute to the prosperity of Shanghai. He believes that in another ten or twenty years, Shanghai can reach the third position among the world's largest commercial ports. Finally, Mr. Song also told the reporter that he regretted not being able to serve his elderly and ailing mother often, so he strongly requested to resign from the position of Director of General Affairs. It is said that Minister Wang deeply relies on Mr. Song's orderly handling of the department's affairs and is therefore trying hard to retain him.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Petition to Ban Illegal Commercial Organizations <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a document to the Municipal Party Department, the Civil Training Committee, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, stating: Regarding the matter of petitioning, Article 11 of the Municipal Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Organizational Procedures promulgated in Civil Training Committee Notice No. 7 states that according to the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Reorganization Procedures of the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee, after the restructured trade association receives the certificate from the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee, it should immediately submit the certificate along with the association's constitution, membership roster, staff resumes, and other survey forms to this committee for certification in accordance with the above procedures. Article 12 states that after the trade association receives the approval decree with the above certification, it should immediately apply for registration with the Social Affairs Bureau. Previously, the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee had reorganized the commercial organizations in this city in accordance with the National Government's decision on industrial and commercial trade associations, and those whose organizations were not fully compliant with current laws and regulations were ordered to restructure in accordance with the law, and those with several organizations in the same industry in one area were ordered to merge in accordance with the law. Only after the reorganization was completed were certificates issued separately. After the establishment of the Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber has continued to handle the organizations that were not yet ready for reorganization by the previous Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee according to the previous plan. Therefore, commercial organizations established before the reorganization that have not received a certificate from the Chamber or the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee must have the following situations: although they have registered with the previous Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee, their organization fundamentally conflicts with current laws and regulations, and there is no possibility of ordering them to restructure or merge; the organization itself has never agreed to accept the letter ordering reorganization or merger; those that meet the second situation have violated the regulations of the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law that require restructuring within a time limit and only allow one association to be established in one area, and therefore cannot be recognized as a legitimate organization and should be banned. Furthermore, according to the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Organizational Procedures promulgated by the Civil Training Committee, if it is a newly established organization, it must go through two procedures of permission and registration; if it is a restructured organization, it must go through two procedures of certification and registration. If the commercial organizations have not gone through the procedures of permission and establishment or registration with the competent authorities, their reorganization has not been completed, and according to Article 4 of the People's Organizations Establishment Procedures and Article 5 of the Municipal Industrial and Commercial Organizations Registration Rules, they should be revoked and banned. Therefore, according to the above-mentioned situations, all those (1) who have not been issued a permit certificate by the Civil Training Committee, (2) who have not registered with the Social Affairs Bureau, (3) who have not been ordered to restructure or merge by the previous Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee or the Chamber, or who have failed to accept the order to restructure or merge, should be banned. However, it is currently found that commercial organizations of this type in this city still handle affairs in the name of their organizations as usual, which is not enough to respect the law. In addition to the organizations of various industries with more than one industry or more than one district that have been registered with the previous Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee, the Chamber should immediately issue a letter ordering them to handle matters in accordance with the articles added to the Industrial and Commercial Trade Union that were passed by the Legislative Yuan on August 2 of this year. It is appropriate to submit a written proposal for the categories of organizations of various industries that have not been completed and should be banned for your review and approval. Please thoroughly investigate and announce the ban one by one, ordering them to end and disband immediately. If they still disobey and secretly collect membership fees, they will be prosecuted for fraud. At the same time, the legally organized organizations of various industries will be published in the newspaper to emphasize the law and avoid confusion. Whether this is appropriate, please instruct us to follow. This is truly in the public interest.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Foreign Ships Greatly Reduce Lake Silk Freight <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Due to Lower Silk Exports Than Last Year</p>
<p>Reduced by Six or Seven Taels of Silver Per Piece</p>
<p>Lake silk exports are the largest part of China's foreign trade. This year, due to repeated disturbances in various silk factories, the number of exports has sharply decreased, and the high price of gold and the low price of silver have affected foreign ships. It is found that the number of Lake silk transported to Europe in the past month has decreased by 6,000 pieces compared to the same period last year. The export business of the British and French mail ship companies in this city has always been dominated by Chinese silk exports. In recent months, the amount of silk carried has been decreasing day by day. The shipping companies have discussed this matter many times. Although it is related to market conditions, the high cost of freight also has an impact. Therefore, it is proposed to reduce the price of silk transported to Europe to an unprecedented level. The freight rate for Lake silk has never fluctuated by more than two or three qian at most, but this time it has dropped by six or seven taels of silver per piece, which is rare in recent years. Yesterday, the British and French shipping companies agreed to allow the new price to be reduced from New Year's Day. The new price has been set and has been issued to the silk merchants to settle this matter and encourage the transportation of silk to Europe. The new and old prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e121">Red Cross Receives Disaster Report from Xianyang Yesterday <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society received a telegram from Chen Bolong and other citizens of Xianyang, Shaanxi, yesterday, reporting the tragic disaster situation, which is hereby disclosed: "Our Qin has suffered from chaos for a long time. The calamities of war and famine have lasted for two years. The number of people who have died cannot be counted. In terms of natural disasters, all counties are the same. In terms of man-made disasters, Xianyang is unique. Because it is located on a thoroughfare, the supply and requisition are extremely heavy, and the people's bones are scraped and their marrow sucked to meet the support, leading to bankruptcy and no means of making a living. What is even more unbearable is that when the soldiers arrive, they will count the number of mouths and search for all the vehicles and horses needed. Therefore, agriculture is delayed, and there are few granaries in the households. Water and drought occur from time to time. Other counties have years of partial flooding, but the corvée is particularly heavy. Xianyang rarely has years without flooding. The vitality has long been lost, and the suffering is particularly severe. Even in years of good harvest, there are many hungry people, let alone years of continuous crop failure, with barren land for thousands of miles. The wood of the tall buildings is completely destroyed for firewood, and the fields that stretch for miles have no owners to sell them to. Fathers abandon their sons, and husbands abandon their wives. It is difficult to keep the flesh and blood whole. They say goodbye with tears. Corpses are piled up, and the souls of the neighbors are miserable. In addition, the Feng army requisitioning is as fierce as wolves and tigers, targeting the households with the last bit of resources. The soldiers still impose taxes on the people who sleep in the wind and dew, and they cannot avoid donating wheels. Therefore, disaster-stricken households are everywhere, and refugees are wailing. It is a heart-wrenching sight. Unexpectedly, during the central government's chaos, there are treacherous and evil people such as Zhen Shoushan and Yao Zhenqian who took the opportunity to steal and manipulate, driving the masses to pretend to be the will of the people and assisting the rebels, betraying and reversing constantly, disregarding the catastrophe of the hometown, and even allowing the bandits to ravage, burn, kill, and rob with inhumanity. They imitate the old tricks of the warlords and create feudal dreams with blatant arrogance, actually resisting orders, and even leading to the emptiness of the loom and swallowing of bran and chaff. They want to break the firewood and firewood, but the room has long been transformed into a grave. They are about to exchange sons and divide their daughters, but the young ones have already become hungry ghosts. In villages of ten households, the smoke and fire are cut off. In areas of hundreds of miles, dogs cannot be heard. The days ahead are long. The dead cannot be brought back to life, and what will the living do to survive? Now that the national army has entered the customs, the demonic atmosphere has been swept away, and the chief culprits have been beheaded. I hope that more people will be freed from their upside-down situation. However, those who are to be pacified are helpless and waiting to die, and the number of refugees without a home is increasing. Small bandits are still lurking in remote areas, and the harvest is poor. I implore you to show compassion and provide relief to those in distress, cut off the source of evil, and restore the vitality of the people. Please also instruct the military officers to send strong troops to earnestly pacify and eliminate the root causes, so that future generations can share peace and enjoy the benefits. This telegram is filled with sorrow and gratitude. We sincerely wish you well."

<h3 id="e122">Appeal for Relief from Banditry in Suqian <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provisional Relief Association received a plea for relief from the Suqian Provisional Disaster Relief Association, which roughly stated: "Since the restoration, Suqian has suffered from water, drought, and banditry every year, but this year's water and banditry disasters are the most severe. It is flooded from the north by the confluence of the Yi and Si Rivers, and from the east by the overflow of the Shu River. In addition, there has been continuous rain for a month, turning hundreds of miles of north-south into a swamp. Eight or nine out of ten people cannot make a living. Moreover, bandits have risen up everywhere. The west of Suining, the south bordering Wansui, and the east to Siyang are all occupied by bandits, who break into villages and attack fortresses, killing and burning at will, and countless people have died. The old and young who have been kidnapped have either died of hunger or been tortured to death with knives. Corpses are piled up, which is a tragic sight. Fortunately, the 52nd Division arrived in Suqian and severely suppressed the bandits. When the bandits retreated, the burning and killing were even more terrible. Dozens of households were burned, and thirty or forty people were killed or injured. There are ruins everywhere, and not even dogs or chickens remain. Those who are fortunate enough to escape are lying weak and helpless in the wilderness, waiting to die. Those who have fled elsewhere have no home to return to. Moreover, wheat has not yet been sown, and there will be no hope for next year. Alas, my people of Suqian have suffered this natural disaster and have also suffered from banditry. In this severe winter, without clothes or food, how can they survive the year? We implore you to quickly bestow kindness and compassion to save the people from disaster. We are at the end of our road and we plead a hundred times over."</p>

<p>The China Jisheng Association has been providing industrial relief to Ninghai and Linhai, which belong to Taizhou Prefecture in Zhejiang Province, this year. Yesterday, Sun Yinting, the director of industrial relief in Ninghai, reported that the embankment projects in Shangdu, Zhongdu, and Xiadu are being carried out according to plan. The funds previously remitted have been almost used up. Recently, due to the needs of the project, another remittance was requested. The association has already remitted 4,000 yuan, and the China Bank of Haimen has remitted money to Yuansheng Zhuang in Shipu to transfer cement needed for the project, which was also transported to Shipu by the Taizhou wheel the other day and entrusted to He Zongyao, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, for transfer to the construction site. Yesterday, the Zhejiang Provincial Relief Association, mindful of the suffering of the disaster victims in the area, specially issued 2,000 old military uniforms to Jisheng Association for transfer to the area, and entrusted Director Sun to distribute them to those in need. In the cold weather, the disaster victims will be very grateful for this kindness. In addition, the temporary Huixiang Bridge project organized by the association is being actively carried out under the direction of Wang Huaiqing. Qu Wenli, director of Taizhou, came to Shanghai yesterday to report that the organization is roughly as follows: A general project office is set up in Zhongdu Dongxiang, and there are seven rural bridge projects, so a separate office is set up for each project, and one or two directors are hired to preside over the project affairs, and several local people are hired as assistant committee members.</p>

<p>Due to Ministry Order Prohibiting</p>
<p>The General Post Office stated that crepe packages have previously self-ignited in transit, causing significant losses. Although the dyes have been improved, experts have tested them and it is still difficult to guarantee that there is no danger. Therefore, it recently petitioned the Ministry of Communications to ask whether it could refuse to accept and mail them. It is heard that the office received a Ministry order yesterday stating that the prohibition on accepting and mailing will continue to be implemented in order to emphasize postal transportation and ensure safety.</p>

<p>The Weather Turned Suddenly Cold</p>
<p>The city has been experiencing continuous overcast and rainy weather, and the climate has gradually turned cold.

Around 1:35 PM, snow pellets suddenly fell for about ten minutes and then stopped. This was the first time seeing snow this winter. As a result, the weather felt particularly harsh, and the Fahrenheit temperature dropped sharply to 41 degrees, six degrees lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Chen Shifan Escapes Danger <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Chen Sends a Letter to the Newspaper</p>
<p>Escaped Danger Yesterday from Kidnappers</p>
<p>Chen Shifan, the Ningbo native and owner of the Chenlinji Construction Company, residing at 114 Rue de la P. Stone in the French Concession, was kidnapped by bandits around 9 PM the night before last (the 19th) at the entrance of the Fuzhili alley on Pingwang Street in the Public Concession. Details were reported in this newspaper. Unexpectedly, at around 1 AM yesterday morning, Chen, taking advantage of the kidnappers' deep sleep, single-handedly escaped from the bandits' den on Rue Ratard, climbing over the wall with a ladder. He then took a rickshaw directly home and reported the situation to the French Concession Police Station. The detectives dispatched by the captain went to the den to arrest the bandits, but they had already fled after hearing the news. Upon investigation, the bandits' den was located at the intersection of Rue Ratard and Avenue Joffre. The house was very small and the location extremely quiet. It was an unrented shop fronting the street, with the street number being 330. The storefront was tightly locked, and the bandits used it as a temporary ransom holding facility. They used a bamboo ladder to enter and exit through the rear wall. The detectives found the house empty and reported back to the captain. Some detectives were then dispatched to stand guard. Yesterday afternoon, just as this newspaper's reporter was about to investigate the scene, they received a letter from the kidnap victim Chen Shifan, detailing the kidnapping and escape. The original letter is transcribed below:</p>
<p>"Respectfully, after being kidnapped the night before last, I was held in a small house at the intersection of Rue Ratard and Avenue Joffre. This house is an unrented shop fronting the street, tightly locked, and used by the bandits as a den. The bandits used a bamboo ladder to enter and exit through the rear wall. Once inside, I was guarded by two bandits in the kitchen under the house. They sat on the floor. By last night, I had been awake for a whole day and night, and I was exhausted. I then tempted them to fall asleep and planned a desperate gamble. The bandits agreed, and shortly after, the two bandits fell into a deep sleep. I thought this opportunity was rare and easy, so I slowly moved and found a bamboo ladder, climbed over the wall, and escaped. After running a few steps, I saw a rickshaw and hastily took it home. I immediately informed the French Concession Police Station, and they dispatched detectives to arrest the bandits, but they had already learned of it and fled. I am merely making a living in the construction industry and have a very small scale, so I have never contracted large projects. The house I live in is also rented land, built by myself. This newspaper reported that I also operate real estate and construction businesses, which is quite impressive, but this is not true. The Rongyangli Commercial Real Estate Company is a small general association organized by me and others, entirely for entertainment purposes and has no other functions. Therefore, I am writing this letter to clarify the true situation. Chen Shifan, respectfully. Twenty-first day of the twelfth month of the nineteenth year [of the Republic]."</p>
<p>It was noted that two kidnapping cases occurred on the 19th. One was the case of Ding Ziren, the owner of the Fuxin Flour Factory No. 2 on West Suzhou Road. Ding is currently still being held captive, and there is no news from the bandits' den. Now Chen has unexpectedly escaped, which is fortunate. Some are fortunate, some are not.</p>

<p>Zhu Haixiang, a native of Fenghua, 34 years old, residing at Song Debao's house in the first alley of Baoxing Road in Zhabei, was walking along Jing'an Temple Road near the Racecourse at around 6 PM last night when he was suddenly struck by a car with the Concession registration number 9806 driven by a British soldier, knocking him to the ground.

<h3 id="e139">Soft Entry, Hard Exit Robbery <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Sneaking into the House and Looting</p>
<p>This is Called the Soft Entry, Hard Exit Method</p>
<p>The Circumstances of the Two Pawnshops Being Robbed are Similar</p>
<p>After Investigation, the Three Thieves are Transferred for Interrogation</p>
<p>The Gongchang Pawnshop at 1072 Pingliang Road was robbed at 2:30 AM on the 13th of last month by robbers who entered through the roof. Each held a handgun and looted the gold jewelry. The shop employees woke up from their dreams, but dared not speak out because the thieves were armed. After looting, the thieves took long gowns, dressed themselves, opened the back door, and fled. After the owner inspected the damage, the losses were no less than five thousand yuan. He reported the case to the police station to investigate. The conduct of this type of thief is different from other thieves, who often rob at night but do not enter through the door. Among them, it is called soft entry, hard exit. During the summer, the Wanji Pawnshop at 1913 Avenue Edouard VII was also robbed by soft entry, hard exit thieves, losing five bolts of silk, a loss of only about two hundred gold, not as large as Gongchang. Both cases have not yet been solved. Recently, the French Concession police captured three thieves and transferred them to the French Concession Court for sentencing. Xu Ali and Duan Atian were each sentenced to five years of imprisonment, and Gong Amao was expelled from the Concession. The three thieves were the masterminds behind the robberies of the Gongchang and Wanji shops. The Yangshupu Police Station transferred them from the French Concession Police Station the day before yesterday and brought out two bolts of silk, the original stolen goods, from a pawnshop. They were then transferred to the Special District Court. The owners sent employees to the court to describe the robbery and identify Xu Ali. Judge Ge asked Xu, and the thief admitted that he was invited by the fugitives Dai Aer and Mao Haixiang to rob Gongchang. After the robbery, he received 175 yuan. Mao gave him another 100 yuan to give to Duan Atian, because Duan had participated in the plan beforehand. As for the Wanji case, he did it with the fugitive Chen Donglin, and he received two bolts of silk, which are the ones that have been brought out today. Duan Atian testified that before robbing Gongchang, he discussed it at the Xinhua Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. Xu came to invite him temporarily, but he refused to go. Two days later, Mao Hailin gave him 100 yuan. The court ordered the defendants to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Another Accusation of Fraud Against Fuhua Bank <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Fuhua Bank at 8 Jiujiang Road was falsely established by swindler Liu Jiugao, Liu Ying, along with Westerner Yaguluo De, Huang Zhitang, and Cao Liugen, and others, who used newspaper advertisements to solicit employees to defraud guarantee money. The victim Huang Bingyan reported the case, and the Special District Court repeatedly summoned the Chinese defendants, Liu and others, to court for trial, and ordered them to post bail. However, Huang was not the only victim. After Huang filed the lawsuit, Xu Shousu from Ningbo, and Yuan Shilin and Gu Jinsheng from the local area, also suffered the same losses as Huang. Therefore, they followed Huang's example and hired lawyers to sue the Special Court. According to Xu's testimony in the trial the day before yesterday, he saw an advertisement on July 28th recruiting employees, and since he was unemployed, he went to visit and contacted the bank manager, Liu Jiugao. They agreed to pay a guarantee of 1,000 taels and signed a contract. He started working on August 13th. After being there for a month, he found nothing to do and felt suspicious. He resigned voluntarily, but Jiugao repeatedly evaded the issue of canceling the contract and returning the guarantee. On October 30th, he suddenly wanted to use the guarantee as a loan, and he realized that he had been defrauded. Yuan Shilin claimed that he saw an advertisement for two accountants and contacted Jiugao at Fuhua. He demanded a guarantee of 1,000 yuan, saying that it was okay to use real estate deeds instead of cash, and boasted that the capital was 500,000, so there would be no fraud. So he first paid 500 yuan, and the remaining money was handed over to Liu Ying. Gu Jinsheng claimed that he joined as a trainee and handed over a guarantee of 200 yuan to Jiugao. Cao Liugen was the director of the cash section of Fuhua. Only the defendant Liu Jiugao appeared in court, claiming that Liu Ying was his son-in-law, and the position of manager was held by Liu Ying. He was a doctor and denied any knowledge of the fraud. Judge Wu Tingqi ordered the defendant to post bail and try the case together with the one filed by Huang Bingrong.</p>

<p>The Brazilian Mr. Zhubielin (photographed by Wusong Just Me Photo Studio) was assassinated</p>
<p>Mr. Zhubielin, a Brazilian national and superintendent of the Woosung Bar Improvement Commission at Zhanghuabang, was walking to Zhanghuabang Station around 6 PM the day before yesterday when he was suddenly shot by thugs on a small road about half a mile from the bureau. He was hit in the vital part of his temple and immediately fell to the ground and died. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the body was examined by prosecutor Yang of the local court, along with coroners, at the scene of the incident at 2 PM yesterday. It was found that the deceased had been shot and killed before his death. The form was immediately filled out, and the body was claimed by the family for burial. The method of arresting the murderer will be handled according to law. After the case occurred, according to the Woosung Bar Improvement Commission staff, the deceased had only been working at the commission for a few months. They recalled that a few days before the incident, a Western friend came to the bureau to meet the deceased, and there was a fierce argument between the two. Then the Western friend left angrily. This seems to have some connection with the deceased being murdered, so the First Precinct of the Seventh District of the Public Security Bureau paid great attention to this clue and has begun to investigate to arrest the murderer according to law.</p>

Although Dong Kang, Dong Yu's uncle, and others mediated, it was ineffective. Dong Yu continued to submit additional arguments the day before yesterday. It is reported that Dong's wife, Ms. Jiang, has hired lawyers Sheng Shengxiu, Wu Kanghou, and Er Lushi to draft a rebuttal to Dong Yu's arguments. The original statement is excerpted below:</p>
<p>1.  False accusations of divorce, mediation hopeless, requesting a speedy legal ruling. This case stems from the plaintiff Dong Yu's lawsuit against the defendant Jiang Youzhi, alleging that she has long suffered from lung disease and requesting a divorce. The court has held two trials and ordered mediation, showing the fairness and impartiality of the court. The plaintiff's uncle, Dong Kang, invited the plaintiff to his house for negotiations several times. The defendant also expressed her opinions to Dong Kang: (1) If she is to be welcomed back for cohabitation, the previous treatment must be improved, and she must not continue to live in the pavilion, be treated with jealousy, and be treated worse than a maidservant; (2) If they live separately, the necessary living expenses for the mother and daughter and the daughter's marriage expenses when she grows up must be effectively guaranteed and must not be搪塞 with empty words leading to no way to collect; (3) If the above two items can be fulfilled, the plaintiff should write another letter allowing her to unite with others, abandoning his rights and not interfering. The plaintiff replied that he would welcome her back after the court's ruling, making a humorous statement and leaving. In such a case, who should bear the responsibility for the insincere mediation? Seeing the Min Guo Daily on the 17th, the plaintiff submitted a strange account of the original situation in the plea to request summons, and those who are difficult to silence is divided into three points, carefully debated as follows: (1) Knowing in advance that the marriage with Ms. Lu was out of obedience to the elders, and accepting this marriage, it was discovered that the former Judicial Chief Dong Kang was the plaintiff's uncle, and he relied on his cultivation to have today. In the 10th year of the Republic, the plaintiff served as an assigned secretary in the Shandong Higher Court. He knew that the Liu family in Changzhou had a daughter to be married, so he asked the Liu's adopted daughter, Ms. Chi, to be a matchmaker. Ms. Li did not agree, but the defendant's aunt was the eldest daughter-in-law of the Liu family, so she pulled the defendant to be a matchmaker. Immediately, she sent a photo for review and obtained her consent. In the autumn, the engagement was made in Dong Kang's Beijing residence. At that time, one matchmaker was her brother-in-law, Mr. Bao, and the other was Fan Zhaochang. That winter, she heard that the plaintiff had married the adopted daughter of the Lu family in Haimen in Jinan. Her aunt sent a letter to rebuke Dong Kang, who immediately summoned the plaintiff to Beijing and tried to persuade him to dissolve the marriage with the Jiang family to avoid future entanglements. The plaintiff insisted that there was no problem with Ms. Jiang as his wife and Ms. Lu as his concubine, and ordered him to write a letter. After the plaintiff returned, he entrusted his cousin Dong Banggan, who was a prosecutor, to send a letter to Ms. Chi proving the status of嫡庶. The original letter was sent to the south and preserved by the defendant's mother's family. This is the real situation when the engagement was made. The national marriage system has long been changed from the old law, and even parents can hardly interfere extremely. How can a family member force a marriage based on the status of a family member? Such a change of facts is like a dream. (2) The lawyer Lu's letter is referred to as a severance of all ties. After returning to her husband's home, she was not treated equally due to Ms. Lu's obstruction. At that time, relatives and friends urged the defendant to file a lawsuit for bigamy. The defendant was born into a famous family and was well-versed in her mother's teachings, remembering the meaning of one marriage and relying on it for life. She could not bear to do this. After that, she was abandoned outside many times, which cannot be described in writing. Finally, she lived in the Liu family in Changzhou for more than a year, and Dong Kang mediated. She only received 30 yuan before and after, while Ms. Lu lived in Shanghai.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>The daily necessities and clothing were so different that they seemed to be in different worlds. How can there be any kindness or righteousness on the plaintiff's side? Finally, she had to entrust lawyer Lu Hongyi of Suzhou to send a letter questioning the matter. The support of husband and wife is recorded in the Civil Code. This is also the right given to the defendant by law to assert her rights. Does this constitute a condition for divorce? (3) 3,000 taels should be compensated for the marriage loss. The marriage was in the autumn of the eleventh year of the Republic, and everything was done hastily. She was married into the defendant's home. The engagement gifts and jewelry were four pieces. Three days later, she claimed that they were borrowed from relatives and returned them. In addition, there were no newly made clothes. The cost of the day was roughly estimated to be no more than 300 yuan. A few days later, she went north with him. All the travel expenses were borrowed by the defendant, 40 yuan was used and has not been returned. Today, men and women are being encouraged to be equal. She has been subjected to such oppression and abuse by a young man from the north. Finally, she wants to compensate her with 3,000 taels. Is it because men should have a superior position? The most ridiculous thing is that the Dong Yu statement was published in the newspaper on the same day. There are words in the text of forging documents and wantonly attacking the deceased wife. The documents referred to should be the original letters and photos submitted by the defendant during the second trial. One is the letter from his cousin mentioned earlier, and the other is the letter directly sent by the plaintiff to Dong Kang to prove that he would allow the defendant to manage the household in the future. The experience of these two letters has been seen and heard by all Dong and Jiang families, relatives and friends. The defendant's submission was not to compete with the deceased Ms. Lu for the status of嫡庶, but to provide information for the reference of important cases. May I ask who wrote this letter and who delivered it? What responsibility should be borne under the criminal law for forging documents? To cleanse his own stain, he lightly imposed the punishment of Article 225 of the criminal law on the third party. People should be free from shame in everything they do in life. Such behavior is utterly forgetful of his current position. To sum up, the plaintiff has failed to understand the instructions of the court. The defendant is unlucky and has inherited a previous life. What more can she say? She is deeply worried that the case will not be settled for a long time, and that the complexities of the case will become more and more complicated. She can only ask the court to expedite the legal ruling to support the weak and promote justice. This is a true virtue. Respectfully, to the Shanghai French Concession Mixed Court.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Asia Hotel Owner Wang Tingxiang Accused of Bigamy by Wife <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Marries Concubine Due to Wife's Infertility</p>
<p>Concubine Does Not Dare to Presume</p>
<p>Judge Still Hopes for Reconciliation</p>
<p>The Asia Hotel on Guangdong Road is owned by Wang Tingxiang from Ningbo. Wang had already married Yang Zhishan's daughter, Xiuzhen. However, feeling incomplete, last March he married Lou Ruizhen, a prostitute from Hangzhou. Now, Xiuzhen has accused him of bigamy at the Special District Local Court. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi convened a hearing. According to Yang Xiuzhen's complaint, the defendant married Lou Ruizhen on March 18th. She, being bedridden at the time, heard the news and, despite her illness, rushed to the Asia Hotel. She saw the hall brilliantly lit with candles and a grand banquet with over a hundred guests joyously drinking. Below the stage, various performances were staged to entertain the guests. After a while, Lou Ruizhen, dressed in festive attire, went to the guests to offer wine. Although she, the plaintiff, did not witness the wedding with her own eyes, many relatives and friends did. However, they all sided with the defendant and were unwilling to uphold justice. When the defendant sent out invitations, people had tried to dissuade him, but he not only refused to listen but also beat and humiliated her, even tearing out several strands of her hair, which she is still hiding. As she spoke, she opened her package to show the strands of black hair. She continued, saying that since marrying Lou, the defendant had abandoned her and neglected her. Because she lacked living expenses, she had to ask the Asia Hotel's accountant for funds. Regardless of how small the amount was, if the defendant found out, he would not only abuse her but also suspend the accountant. Such instances were too numerous to list. He openly abandoned his wife to remarry, and even abused his legal wife. She requested that he be punished according to the law to uphold justice and maintain social order. When questioned, Wang Tingxiang confessed that because the plaintiff had never given birth, he took Lou as a concubine. There was no wedding ceremony held, nor did he send out invitations or hold a banquet. The plaintiff's claims were not entirely true. Lou Ruizhen testified that she was 25 years old and had been a prostitute in Huile Lane for 17 years. She met Wang Tingxiang in February of that year and then became his concubine. Initially, Wang rented a place for her, and she met with the plaintiff several times. They were harmonious with each other. The plaintiff herself knew she could not bear children and hoped she would give birth to an heir as soon as possible to avoid becoming an ancestor without descendants. They traveled to West Lake together and took a photo (the photo was submitted as evidence). From this, it can be seen that their relationship was extremely harmonious. She, coming from a brothel, was content to be a concubine. She would not dare to presume or become an enemy of the person who rescued her. There was indeed no wedding ceremony held. However, on that day, she moved from another place to the Asia Hotel, and Tingxiang's friends sent gifts for the move, so he also prepared wine to thank them. The defendant invited his friends Shen Ziliang, Zhang Zipei, Hu Mingchun, and others to testify that the wine that evening was indeed prepared by Wang to express his gratitude to those who gave gifts for the relocation. Because both parties held differing opinions, Judge Wu ordered them to reconcile privately. If reconciliation failed, another hearing would be scheduled.</p>

<p>Liu Xiaohezi, a woman from Jiangbei, is 25 years old and earns a living by mending clothes. She married Liang Baofa, who is 23 years old and works as an incense seller in the Mengjiangtang Temple in the West Warehouse Bridge in the city. They were supposedly of equal class and a good match. However, the woman has recently adopted new trends and hired lawyer Zhou Yu to file a lawsuit in the local court to divorce her husband. Her wording is quite interesting, stating that she married the defendant at the age of 18, influenced by the matchmaker Zhao's deceptive words. Unexpectedly, her husband has no roof over his head or land to his name. Every morning, the plaintiff carries a basket and mends clothes on the street, earning wages to barely make ends meet, while her husband idles at home, looking forward to three meals a day and a good sleep at night. Although the plaintiff appears to be suffering on the surface, she is spiritually happy and has given birth to a son. The year before last, thanks to the employer's help, her husband obtained a position as an incense seller, finally able to support himself. However, he immediately became heartless. While she was breastfeeding and unable to work, he neglected her meals and even beat her severely. For the past two years, she has suffered from hunger and cold. Recently, he even plotted to force her into prostitution to earn money and marry another woman, abandoning his wife who shared his hardships. Yesterday, Judge Zhang opened the court. The plaintiff was absent, but lawyer Zhou arrived and requested a postponement, which the judge granted.</p>

<p>The exchange rate for silver dollars in the local northern and southern markets decreased several times last week, with each silver dollar exchanging for 260 copper coins and each small silver dollar (i.e., five double dimes) exchanging for ten cents, plus 23 or 24 copper coins. Starting yesterday, the rate suddenly increased. The exchange rates posted by various money shops and cigarette paper shops showed each silver dollar exchanging for 270 or 268-9 copper coins, each small silver dollar exchanging for five double dimes plus 260 or 70 copper coins, and each double dime exchanging for 48 or 49 copper coins, an increase of 70-80 coins compared to the previous day's rate.</p>

<p>Zhang Huawen, a 21-year-old from Jiaxing, checked into room number 146 of the Ronghua Inn on Mintiniyin Road in the French Concession alone on the evening of the 18th. It is unknown what kind of stimulation he felt, which led him to take his own life by swallowing poison that evening. By the next day, the tea attendant thought that Zhang was still asleep and did not want to wake up. He knocked on the door but received no response. He forced the door open and entered, only to find that Zhang had died. He immediately reported to the Songshan Road police station. Investigators were dispatched to investigate and found three pawn tickets, four dimes, and 490 copper coins beside the deceased. There were no other belongings. The body was then transported to the Tongren Fuyuantang morgue for examination. No relatives of the deceased were found. Yesterday morning, the criminal section of the French police reported to Judge Zhu of the French Court, who arrived at the scene to determine that the deceased had indeed died of poisoning. He ordered the police to photograph the body and instructed the Tongren Fuyuantang to provide a coffin for burial, awaiting identification by relatives.</p>

The family waited at home until late but she did not return, so they sent people out to search but could not find her. They have now reported to the police station and requested that detectives be dispatched to investigate the whereabouts of the maid.</p>

<p>To the Editors of Shenbao:</p>
<p>Regarding the news report in your esteemed newspaper about the assassination of Mr. Wang Baoxie, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Rickshaw Guild, which mentioned that Mr. Wang had dealings with our guild and that the municipal government had ordered the suspension of licenses for the Hua-area rickshaw industry, we are deeply shocked. Mr. Wang is from the Zhabei rickshaw industry and the business scope of our guild, which is located in the Public Concession, is separate and has never had any relationship with our guild. Therefore, there is no question of many dealings. Furthermore, it is not true that the municipal government has recently ordered the Chinese and foreign rickshaw guilds in the concessions to join the Shanghai Rickshaw Guild before April 1st of next year to ensure uniformity, otherwise, licenses in the Chinese area will not be issued. Apart from the two notices we received from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau on October 7th and 15th to discuss our guild's joining the Shanghai Rickshaw Guild, we have not received any notice from any municipal government agency to suspend the issuance of licenses in the Chinese area. This matter concerns the reputation and interests of our guild members, so we hereby request a correction.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Rickshaw Merchants Guild</p>

<h3 id="e162">A Record of Japanese Go Master Honinbo Shusai and His <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Pudong Disciple Jue Mi</p>
<p>Mr. Tao Shen'an Hongxiang from Lujiahang, Pudong, is one of the disciples of the Japanese Go master Honinbo Shusai. In Japan, Go players of the 3rd or 4th dan are called high-level players, those of the 5th, 6th, or 7th dan are called masters, those of the 8th dan are called quasi-masters, and those of the 9th dan are called masters. Honinbo Shusai is a 9th dan master. Currently, there is only one 9th dan master in Japan, and that is Honinbo Shusai. Tao had no teacher in Go at first. Because of his love for it, he devoted himself to this art. From a young age, he studied the Go scores of his predecessors and was familiar with the Go scores of all dynasties in our country. Therefore, in a few years, his Go skills greatly improved and he had no equal in his hometown. He read the Go scores of famous Japanese players and admired Honinbo Shusai, so he treated him as a disciple and asked him for advice. Honinbo Shusai, seeing that his Go skills were extraordinary, also accepted him as a disciple, gave him guidance, and exchanged letters with him every day. His skills greatly improved. At the same time, Zhang Danru and Wang Ziyan were also remotely learning from Honinbo Shusai. Zhang was a famous figure in Shanghai who loved Go all his life and was rich in wealth. He always tried to recruit anyone in the country who was skilled in this art. Therefore, his guests were often full, mostly famous figures in the country. Hearing of Tao's reputation, he recruited Tao and treated him as an honored guest. Wang Ziyan was Zhang's tutor and taught at Zhang's house. From then on, the three of them were known as close friends. Tao's family was a prominent family in Lujiahang, and because he inherited the legacy of his ancestors, he was well-fed and well-clothed. Moreover, he was quiet and indifferent and lived in the countryside all his life, not asking about worldly affairs or seeking fame. He only devoted himself to Go. My sister's husband, Mr. Zhu Futian, was from the same village as him. In the Jiazi year, to celebrate the 100th birthday of his father and son, he founded the Jiazi Primary School in Xinlu Town as a memorial to the 100th birthday of his father and son. Because Tao was too idle, he was hired as the principal. Tao also took it upon himself. In his spare time, Tao taught students about seasonal flowers or taught teachers about Go. Therefore, at that time, many teachers at Jiazi were able to play Go and many students were able to garden. Duan Qirui loved Go all his life. When he was in power, he heard of Tao's reputation and sent a special envoy to the south to invite Tao to the capital. Tao's mother and wife both wanted him to go to the capital and prepared luggage and clothes for him, costing hundreds of yuan. But Tao was reluctant to go. Not long after, Duan stepped down and Tao did not go to the capital. In the autumn of the following year, he died of dysentery at the age of only thirty-odd. Before his death, he wrote a book called "Essence of Japanese Go", which collected the Go games of various Japanese Go players, extracted the essence and used it broadly, translated it into Chinese, and added commentary. Therefore, it was called "Essence". The manuscript had just been completed and had not been collated when Tao died. After Tao's death, Wang Ziyan found the book when mourning Tao and collated it for him. Zhang Danru asked someone to write a preface for it and had it published in the world. The book was printed in Japan, and the version was exquisite and cost over a thousand yuan. If Tao knew in the afterlife that he had obtained this confidant after his death, he would have no regrets. During his lifetime, the Japanese Go Institute had approached him with a dan rank, but it is not known which dan it was, either 4th dan or 5th dan, but it was probably between 4th and 5th dan, and he was undoubtedly a first-class figure in our country's Go. It is a pity that our country had such talent in Go but died so early. What a pity!</p>

<p>Woman (extraordinarily happy, smelling the flowers again and again): Thank you, you can please me so much that I am extremely happy (uncontrollably kissed the man)</p>
<p>Man (flattered): Miss C, I...</p>
<p>Woman (blushing): I'm sorry, I offended you</p>
<p>Man: No, no, I'm going to buy another bouquet of roses, can you still give me a kiss like this?</p>
<p>Fat country woman (going to Da Gong to buy things, taking the elevator, saying to the driver): Go up, go up</p>
<p>Driver: What floor?</p>
<p>Fat country woman: I want to buy furniture, which floor is it on?</p>
<p>Driver: That's on the fifth floor.</p>
<p>Fat country woman (looking at the small driver): I see that you are such a small person, but you have the strength to take me up?</p>
<p>Woman: Dear, you just keep saying that you love me, love me, I don't know if you really love me in your heart?</p>
<p>Man: I really love you wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>Man: Last night, when I said goodbye to you and kissed you, your dog bit a piece of meat from my leg, but I didn't even feel it, so you can know that I am focused on you.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Research on the Drama Lyrics of Mei Lanfang's Farewell My Concubine <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Mei Huaguanzhu</p>
<p>The drama "Farewell My Concubine" occupies a very important position in the old dramas. Every time Mei Wan Hua comes to the south, the ticket sales for the night of "Farewell My Concubine" will increase several times. Its magic is truly extraordinary. I have seen this drama three times. The first time was at the Tianchan Stage, when Xiaolou played Xiang Yu, which was of course very wonderful. The second time was at the Gong Stage, because Xiaolou did not come with him, the role of Overlord had to be played by Zhou Rui'an. The appearance was similar, but the spirit was not, and the difference was far away. The third time was at the Daxin Stage (now the Tianchan Stage). The Overlord was Jin Shaoshan. Although Shaoshan did not have Xiaolou's solemnity and composure, his dark and wailing singing voice was enough to give the audience considerable satisfaction. This time when I came to the south, this drama was performed once. I was too busy to go and watch it, but according to my friends, Shaoshan's skills have been deepening recently, and the fire has disappeared. Compared with a few years ago, he is much more brilliant. Although Hua's age has increased, because of his wonderful makeup, his appearance has not decreased. As for his performance and expressions, of course, he has been improving with the times and becoming more and more vivid.</p>
<p>Wan Hua灌(recorded) by Bei Kai Company (Since I followed the King to conquer the east and fight the west, I have suffered from wind, frost and toil year after year. I only hate that the merciless Qin smeared the creatures with charcoal, which aroused the heroes to chase the deer in the Central Plains) The four sentences of the original singing of the slow board, melting the new tune and the old tune in one furnace, have a different kind of realm. No one else can sing this well. In the autumn of this year, a certain gentleman in the Liyuan Public Report doubted Wan Hua's slow board of Farewell My Concubine, saying that Wan Hua had always sang the shaken board on the stage (since I··) in the four sentences, but now in the Bei Kai movie, he suddenly changed to singing the slow board, thinking that it was necessary to study it, and said that the rules of the play fundamentally cannot change the shaken board to the slow board. I didn't dare to believe Mr. so-and-so's theory at the time, because I knew very well that Wan Hua did sing the slow board once at the Gong Stage, not the shaken board (there is a record in my previous work "Little Shenbao" at that time). However, I didn't want to be too confident, so I wrote to Wan Hua himself, asking him to answer truthfully to clear up the doubts. In a few days, Wan Hua sent me a reply saying (since I followed the King··) The four sentences of the original singing of the slow board were later changed to the shaken board because the time of the whole play was sometimes too long, but it was not inevitable. When recording the film, it was based on the original singing method, so it was a slow board. Singing the shaken board on the stage is indeed a temporary way to change it, as Mr. So-and-so said). According to this, we can know that singing the slow board is the right way, and singing the shaken board is not suitable.</p>
<p>A certain celebrity in Beiping has a little talent and usually pretends to be clever and likes to tamper with the lyrics of famous actors for fun. I once remembered that this gentleman also擅added删改changed for the slow board of 別姫Farewell My Concubine (since I···), changing the third and fourth sentences (恨祇恨無道秦把生靈塗炭才惹得衆豪傑逐鹿中原Hate only hate the merciless Qin smeared the creatures with charcoal, which aroused the heroes to chase the deer in the Central Plains) to (何日裏方得免兵戈擾亂消却了衆百姓困苦哀憐What day will we be able to avoid the chaos of war and eliminate the suffering and pity of the people). I don't think the original lyrics are 落落大方generous and natural, which is exactly the tone of Yu Ji. The gentleman's changed sentences are not only not grand, but also the sentence structure is not as飄逸有致 elegant as the original lyrics.點金成鐵 Turning gold into iron is self-defeating. Those like the gentleman can be said to be ignorant of self-measurement.</p>

<p>It is difficult to judge whether jade is good or bad when it is in the rough stone, and even experts cannot be sure. Looking at the gray stone surface, cutting it open may be worth millions or worthless, which shows how difficult it is to know the rough stone. In the past, Bian He obtained a rough stone in Jing Mountain and knew that it was a priceless treasure, but the king did not believe it and listened to slander and had his feet cut off. Bian He wept while holding the rough stone, and later it was found to be a wall of Liancheng. But it is very difficult for those who know it at the beginning. Those who work in this industry may spend millions of gold without any gains, or they may get fish by raising a net. One person worked in this industry for decades without any gains, but once he got a treasure worth hundreds of thousands, which is like the inventor's six hundred and sixth time.</p>
<p>On the 16th, the KMT branch welcomed and gave a speech on the success of the domestic revolution and the beginning of the world revolution. On the 17th, I went to the Dongmiu area for a gathering. The gathering lasted for several days. Many women were seen in the city. The things sold in the market were simple and crude, like the village gatherings in our small villages. However, there were many clay Buddha statues, and the custom of men and women dancing in front of the gods was prevalent, with young people being the majority and occasional elderly people with white hair. The music and dance were also rhythmic. Traveling two or three miles southwest from Dongmiu, a small boat can reach a winding creek. There is also a large gathering place where men and women dance in front of the gods, but they do not take off their shoes and are not allowed to go ashore. The boatman guided us to bypass the bank to avoid the trouble of taking off our shoes. The boats coming and going greeted each other, and the men and women joked and sang and danced crazily. I do not understand the language, but people say that during these days, the men and women who come to the meeting are all for the purpose of liberating marriage, making an appointment to come, and taking advantage of the gathering to be a period of free marriage, so the boys have no scruples and mostly say words of love to the women. According to this, it is the same as Plato's ideal state of God. How can religion hinder free love? It is even carried out in the name of God. During this meeting, the Chinese also participated, and stayed in the Chinese Guanyin Temple to gamble for several days, because there was nothing else to do. Gambling is not only the case for capital merchants, but also for workers, and even newspaper staff are inevitably involved in gambling. The gambling style in Southeast Asia is like this, and it is difficult for the nation to have hope for progress.</p>
<p>There is a major shortcoming in the "Farewell My Concubine" drama that others do not pay much attention to. Only the host of 婝, 婝主人 (the host is Prince Xun of the Qing Dynasty, and 婝is his other name. He has a deep understanding of 皮黃, and has a unique insight to see the flaws), who has a deep research on 皮黃(Beijing opera), pointed out the flaws and said that the words念(recited) by Yu Ji (可憐無定河邊骨猶是春閨夢裏人Pitiful are the bones by the boundless river, still dreaming of home in their spring boudoirs) are Tang Dynasty poems. Yu Ji was born before the Tang Dynasty, and it is inappropriate to quote Tang Dynasty poems in the drama. The host once had revised words, and I have also seen them, but I cannot remember them because I am forgetful.</p>
<h3 id="e166">A New Deceptive Technique Using Counterfeit Currency <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The methods of defrauding landlords in Shanghai are constantly emerging, as this column has repeatedly reported. However, none are as unique, creative, and remarkably strange as what a relative of mine encountered. I am writing about it and submitting it to this column to reveal its secrets, so that those in Shanghai who have vacant houses for rent can be vigilant.</p>
<p>My relative, Mr. Yi, rents a house in a lane on Avenue Edward VII in West Shanghai. The house has two floors above ground. Mr. Yi doesn't have a large family, so he rents out the remaining rooms. Recently, the tenant of the three rooms above the parlor moved out. Mr. Yi posted a rental advertisement at the entrance of the lane to attract tenants. Within two short hours, a couple appeared, claiming to be looking for a place to live. It was already 3 PM when they arrived. Mr. Yi was out on business, so Mrs. Yi, as usual, led them upstairs to inspect the rooms. The couple's clothing was very fashionable, and their speech was refined, resembling that of the upper class. After the inspection, they seemed quite satisfied. After inquiring about the rent and slightly negotiating it down, they agreed on the price and said they would move in the next day. Mrs. Yi then asked for a deposit of two silver dollars, as it is customary in Shanghai to pay a deposit after agreeing to rent a house to avoid misunderstandings. Upon hearing this, the gentleman took out a wallet filled with banknotes. After examining them for a long time, he smiled and said to Mrs. Yi, "I left home in a hurry today, and all I have is ten-dollar bills. I wonder if you can find eight dollars in change?" Hearing this, Mrs. Yi reached into her pocket, took out her wallet, and saw that she only had six dollars. She then turned to the maid and asked her to take the gentleman's ten-dollar bill to the tobacco shop to exchange it. The gentleman said, "That won't be necessary. Please return the banknote to me, and I will exchange it myself and pay the deposit later." He seemed to distrust Mr. Yi's maid. Mrs. Yi understood and, fearing that the gentleman would not return, borrowed two silver dollars from a housemate to make up the eight dollars and gave it to the gentleman. The gentleman briefly checked it and put it in his pocket, instructing her to clean the rented rooms so he could move in the next day. After saying this, he bid farewell and left. Mrs. Yi then ordered the maid to take the banknote paid by the gentleman to exchange it, but the maid returned and said that the banknote was a fake and worthless. Only then did Mrs. Yi realize she had been deceived. When Mr. Yi returned, she told him what had happened. Mr. Yi couldn't help but be speechless and deeply admired the fraudster's cleverness and meticulous planning.</p>

<p>Chapter Sixteen: Cui Xiu Earnestly Seeks Instruction from a Teacher, a Heroine Generously Discusses Military Affairs at a Brothel.</p>
<p>Zuo Shichen said, "It's not like that. People like you don't need to pursue profound knowledge when you study. Being able to recognize a few more characters and understand the meaning of texts is good enough, and gaining a little more knowledge is convenient for yourself. If you want to study, there is a girls' school on Threemile Road that has established a special class specifically for women who have lost the opportunity to study since childhood. It doesn't limit age or ask about family background. You can sign up and choose a subject, and it's only an hour or two each day. Anyway, you get up early and only have things to do after the lights are lit. With your intelligence, you'll definitely learn something."</p>
<p>Lü Yi shook her head and said, "I won't go. If I weren't in a brothel, studying would be open and aboveboard. Now, going to school during the day as a female student, but running around at night and performing in a brothel, it's like studying is also secretive. Of course, I can't tell people at school that I'm a prostitute, but if the classmates find out, even if they don't attack me, the whispers behind my back would be unbearable. If the headmaster of the school knows that I'm a prostitute and kicks me out, where would I put my face? Wouldn't that be seeking honor but incurring humiliation instead? A Suo also has a younger sister there studying. She's quite smart. When it's time for class, she grabs her book bag and goes to school. After class, she goes straight home and doesn't dare to dress up at all, keeping a plain face. She doesn't even dare to wear silk clothes, only wearing a patriotic cloth qipao. But later, her classmates found out. The teachers didn't say anything, but the classmates' cold words were really unbearable. She cried a lot afterwards and refused to go anymore."</p>
<p>Zuo Shichen said, "In principle, education doesn't distinguish between noble and lowly, and doesn't ask about social class. Confucius said, 'Education should be provided to all, without discrimination,' which means that everyone should receive education, regardless of their background. So why can't prostitutes receive education? However, they think that prostitutes are always of questionable character and always romantic, and they are afraid that one or two people might corrupt others, so they have to guard against that. Therefore, it's okay if the school authorities don't know, but if they do find out, it's indeed a bit difficult."</p>
<p>At this moment, Lü Yi's mother interjected, "Originally, I also told her to go to Threemile Road to study, but she said the same thing. Actually, she really wakes up at ten in the morning. After eating, she sits around doing nothing. There's really nothing to do, so she just plays mahjong. Second Master, why don't you come and teach her a little bit every day? That way, she can recognize more characters and relieve her loneliness."</p>
<p>Zuo Shichen said, "Oh, teach me to be a teacher? I'm very strict! If you can't read, I'll spank you!"</p>
<p>Lü Yi said, "If you're really willing to come and teach, you can spank me if I can't read! But a teacher has to have a teacher's demeanor! Well then, starting tomorrow, you'll come and teach me for one hour every day."</p>

<h3 id="e168">Turbulent Gold Market Last Week <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The surge in the gold market last week was even more intense than the previous week, breaking previous records. However, the situation from the beginning of the week, when the price of silver futures plummeted by ten taels, was the opposite of before. This time, the bears covered their positions, adding three or four taels. The reason for this was that the end of the Gregorian calendar year was approaching, and there was a lack of cash. The bulls did not dare to absorb the losses and instead changed to posting losses. The market suddenly soared, progressing rapidly. This was because overseas markets continued to fall sharply, and large silver bars suddenly broke through fifteen points. In the statistics for this week, the price fell by 4.375. The price of American silver also dropped to 0.625, so the Shanghai exchange rate became tight. However, there were constant fluctuations, and the exchange rate for Changtong silver only increased by half a point (0.125). The daily exchange rate only rose by 0.0125. However, none of these were as sharp as the gold market. The gold rush was unusually turbulent, and the huge waves could not be suppressed. Every day, there were fluctuations of more than ten taels, changing rapidly and unpredictably. Industry insiders were at a loss. In short, the news was mixed. There was an atmosphere of economic depression and a silver market crash in the United States. However, this did not materialize. Moreover, there were sometimes reports of silver being produced. As a result, people were hesitant. On Thursday, a Reuters report announced that the United States was unable to save the silver shortage at the London International Conference, and it was also heard that Russia had suddenly closed Japanese banks (fearing that the Japanese-American exchange rate would rise). The market received this news, which was enough to arouse the interest of general speculators. Major players such as Mr. Wu and Mr. Luo began to scramble to buy, and the bears were forced to cover their positions due to the environment. The market soared, suddenly breaking through the sixty-tael mark. However, many of the previous bulls took advantage of this opportunity to sell and make a profit. Then, rumors suddenly spread that Chase Bank would ship a large amount of cash abroad. The news spread, and the market suddenly saw a new era of 671 taels, unprecedented in history. The surge finally subsided at the end of the week. The silver market and exchange rate seemed to stabilize slightly. As a result, the price increased by 61 taels and 4 mace, an increase of about 20 taels compared to the previous Saturday (excluding the 3 taels for futures). Compared to the opening price on the first day of the swap, the increase was 23 taels and 9 mace. The difference between the highest and lowest prices for February was 37 and a half taels, which was also a large amount. According to the daily exchange rate, the price was actually 30 taels lower. Otherwise, it would have reached a peak of 700 taels. However, it is said that the future path is limited. The bid price only increased by five or six taels. The general situation of the week is described in detail below.</p>
<p>The price rose by more than two taels. From Monday, the exchange rate for large silver bars rose by 0.125, the price of silver rose by 0.25, and the exchange rate listing did not change. The domestic market was tight and then eased. As for the gold market in the current month, the price changed from sharp to soft. In the morning, it had reached 49 and a half taels. In the afternoon, because the swap was opened early privately, the price was slightly suppressed. The market closed at 31 taels and 1 mace at the 30-tael mark, a sharp drop of 9 taels and 9 mace compared to the previous Saturday. On this day, the major player Mr. Lu of Shangyu Dahe sold heavily through Hengxingyuan and Xie. Xinhang also sold some. The next day, the price suddenly turned high due to the swap. The price for January had exceeded the 40-tael mark and then soared by 10 taels. The opening price for February was 637 and a half taels. After that, it fell back to 33 and a half taels. Afterwards, buyers were excited and the price broke through 40 taels. However, the price of large silver bars rose slightly, and there was talk of the United States selling, so people did not pay much attention. The exchange rate had increased by half a point, but the domestic market was firm, indicating that the trend was different. Insiders were all covering their positions, so the afternoon market suddenly improved, exceeding the 50-tael mark. The market closed at 52 taels and 3 mace. The total increase for the day was 20 taels and 0.03 mace. However, the wind and waves were extremely dangerous. On Wednesday, the price of large silver bars fell by more than 0.75, and the price fell sharply. Therefore, the listing of Changtong silver was reduced by half a point, but the internal market was firm. The gold market continued to rise, adding another 5 taels and 3 mace. The next day, the price of large silver bars rose again, and the exchange rate also increased by half a point. However, the market was tight, so the bid price became even more depressed. Moreover, because of foreign news that the United States was finding it difficult to maintain the decline in silver prices, people felt even more optimistic. The price immediately broke through the 60-tael mark. However, the wind and waves were dangerous, with a variation of 17 taels. As a result, the price continued to rise by 3 taels and 2 mace. Major players sold their positions, and the bulls increased their holdings. The next day, the price of large silver bars fell back, and the exchange rate decreased by half a point. The internal market was loose, and traders who specialized in hedging tended to sell, so they covered their positions. However, the difference was small, with Changtong silver being about 10 taels. However, this was already a loss compared to before. The bid price rose early in the morning, and then there were rumors that Chase Bank had previously absorbed cash in preparation for shipping it to the United States. People's confidence suddenly increased, and the market seemed to be reaching its peak. The price suddenly broke through the 70-tael mark, reaching a new record of 671 taels, unprecedented in history. However, the market was still stable, and the decline began immediately. Later, the market fell sharply by eight or nine taels, closing at 62 taels and 3 mace and 63 taels and 3 mace, 2 taels and 5 mace higher than the previous three days (a total of 11 taels). On this day, there was also a difference of 8 taels and 7 mace. On Saturday, the market situation slightly improved, and the sharp drop was one or two taels. However, the changes were very intense. The difference for the day was 9 taels and 5 mace. The result was due to various industry players seeking supply, and there were different losses. The market closed at 61 taels and 4 mace, approximately 1 tael and 9 hao higher than the previous day. The price of large silver bars rose slightly, and the exchange rate increased by one point. The internal market was flat, and there were both short and long positions. The price of raw silver increased by 5 taels. The number of contracts traded on the exchange was only 30,000. In short, the margin was still lacking, so the market price was high. The highest and lowest prices for silver, gold, and exchange rates in England, the United States, and India are listed below.</p>

<p>Large silver bars (near term) 15 pence 1.25 14 pence 5 0.4375</p>

The American silver price also did not change, with the spot price being 0.31625. The English-American exchange rate and the American-English exchange rate remained unchanged, both being 4 dollars 8 angles 5 fen 32 parts and 2 parts per day. The American, English, and Japanese markets were stable, and the Shanghai Changtong silver rate was reduced by 0.0625 to 1 shilling 5 pence 4375. There was no telegraph from Bombay.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Interest Rate Market Flat and Unremarkable <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>

<h3 id="e171">Bond Market Quiet This Past Week <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The bond market in Shanghai has been more quiet this past week, with trading being unusually slow. This quietness has not been seen for a long time. This is because the end of the year is approaching, and all industries are engaged in winding up their affairs, and the bond market environment has not changed at all. Major traders are watching and not moving. Excluding the first day of the week, when nearly 9 million was traded, and Tuesday and Thursday, when over 6 million was traded, the average daily trading volume was only about 4 million. The total trading volume for the week was 34.205 million, a decrease of over 9.5 million compared to the previous week. The 19th Customs bonds were still active, accounting for 10.47 million, with 4.56 million for December and 5.91 million for January. Other bonds, such as the demobilization bonds, accounted for 3.7 million for December and 3.485 million for January; the reorganization treasury bonds accounted for 2.815 million for December and 2.515 million for January; the 19th rehabilitation bonds accounted for 2.79 million for December and 2.15 million for January; the 96th public bonds accounted for 1.38 million for December and 2.055 million for January; the 6% bonds accounted for 455,000 for December and 640,000 for January; the customs duties accounted for 600,500 for December and 415,000 for January. Other bonds were even more scarce. The 19th cigarette bonds accounted for only 515,000, the financial bonds accounted for 115,000, the rehabilitation bonds accounted for 90,000, the 7-year bonds accounted for 10,000, and there were no transactions for the subsequent 25 and accumulated cigarette bonds. The spot market was also extremely quiet, with a total trading volume of 79,500 for the week, with the 19th customs bonds accounting for 40,600 and the demobilization bonds accounting for 14,000. Other bonds accounted for only a few thousand. The price changes of the bonds were minimal due to the stable situation and the unchanged bond market environment. As the end of the Gregorian year approached, all industries were engaged in winding up their affairs, so there was little trading activity, and the trend became even more sluggish. The daily fluctuations were very small, with the largest fluctuations for each bond being only a few angles per yuan. The financial, 96th, rehabilitation, and customs bonds fluctuated by only about half a yuan. The results, compared to the previous week, were mixed, with gains and losses offsetting each other. The 6% bonds rose by about 1 yuan, while the demobilization and current-term mobilization bonds each rose by over 1 yuan. The market situation is difficult to improve in the short term. The statistics for the high and low prices and fluctuations of each bond are listed below (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3 id="e172">Cotton Yarn Auction Ends Well This Past Week <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>However, Current Consumer Spending is Extremely Weak</p>
<p>The initial trend of the Shanghai cotton yarn market was unpredictable this past week, with the exception of a good two tael in auctions. Due to the weakening global situation and the approaching end of the year, actual sales were sluggish, and Chaozhou merchants and Japanese traders unanimously dumped their holdings, causing the market to reach a new low price. Shortly after, American cotton slightly improved, and the matter of export duties greatly boosted the market. Factories in the interior, as a precaution, purchased more than 1,000 bales of yarn, greatly shocking the market and tightening prices. However, actual sales were particularly quiet throughout the week. The lowest price for the current month's yarn was 135 taels and 5 mace, and the highest price was 140 taels and 0 mace and 3 mace. As a result, the price of each month was up to two taels higher than the previous week.</p>
<p>The cotton market has been relatively healthy, and the cotton market is still firm. Due to the strange changes in the exchange rate, the supply from various sources is not smooth, resulting in a limited amount of base goods, and the bulls have been very strong, refusing to loosen their grip in the near term. However, the cotton markets in the United States and India are extremely weak, so Chinese and foreign factories have switched to purchasing foreign cotton because of its lower price. Chinese cotton has been completely eroded by foreign cotton, and many traders have been dumping their holdings, indicating that the struggle between the bulls and bears is fierce. At the end of the week, the American cotton government announced that it would continue to maintain cotton prices, which boosted people's confidence and increased the market price. The cotton market is currently unpredictable, with fluctuations of about one or two taels. The price of each month's cotton in the auction was up six or seven mace compared to the previous week.</p>
<h3 id="e173">American Cotton Rises Due to Short Covering <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton rose due to short covering and purchases by traders, with a lack of sellers. The market was stable and firm. Futures rose by 8 to 12 points, and spot prices rose by 10 points. English cotton futures rose by 23 points, and spot prices fell by 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. Indian cotton was firm due to a harvest report that was favorable to the bulls. The price of Pingguoer rose by 1 rupee, and the price of far-term cotton rose by 2 rupees. The near-term and far-term prices of Aomura and Bai Luo Xi rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram records are left (20th telegram). American cotton is the same as the Shanghai standard as of the previous day. English cotton is the same as the Shanghai standard as of the previous day.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Grain and Rice Market Continues to Stabilize <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the various gangs in Zhabei saw about 30 rice boats sailing north, and sales were very smooth. Sales of high-quality goods were particularly strong, with prices particularly high, opening at 14 yuan. Although there was no change in the secondary market, the situation was clearly stable and secretly loose. This was because both the shops and customers were watching, and the buying interest had eased. The supply of thin rice was scarce at the source, with only a few inquiries from the countryside. The market situation was unchanged. The top-quality Yangxian rice was in short supply, and the market price was high, with eager customers. The price was between 12.96 and 7 jiao. The sales of Duxian and Buxian rice were sluggish, and the price remained stable. Sales were not smooth, and the price of Yinyuan rice was also flat. The market was generally flat.</p>
<p>Yesterday, about 10 boats arrived at the south of Shanghai. The common gang machine japonica rice market had shifted to a volatile situation. Sales of high-quality goods were brisk, while sales of secondary goods were not strong. The price of Su Tong white japonica rice also rose, and the price of secondary goods was suppressed. The market price was stable, but there were small fluctuations of around an angle. The price of top-quality Su Gang rice gradually reached around 13 yuan. Early-season and early rice in the South Gang were slightly tight due to the arrival of dry rice and reports of firmness from the production areas, but the overall trend was not good. Sales of Yangdu and other indica rice were sluggish, and the arrival price was close to the exchange rate. There were very few buyers of Yinyuan rice, and the special goods were still depressed, so the market price was slightly soft.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Silk and Tea: Static Silk Market This Past Week <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Silk Merchants are Unmoving</p>
<p>Overseas Silk Telegrams are Not Transferring, and There is Transaction But No Market for European and American Chinese Silk</p>
<p>Cloth Factories' Appetite is Not Smooth, Shanghai Silk Factories Have Ceased Production Early</p>
<p>The Shanghai Foreign Merchant Silk Market has been even more silent this past week due to the increasingly precarious economies of overseas nations. Bankruptcies are reported daily, and most silk weaving factories have ceased production. The consumption of raw silk has decreased, and the stocks are piling up. There has been no movement in factory sales, and New York and Lyon have not had a market for raw silk for two weeks. Telegraphs from Shanghai have been similarly unresponsive. The 30-odd silk factories that are still running have been trying to clear their stocks of silk by the end of the year, but the stocks are increasing rapidly. The financial situation at the end of the year is increasingly tight, and silk cocoon loan repayments are being urged. With silk but no place to borrow against it, and no funds for capital turnover, the silk factories are ceasing operations early for the New Year holiday in order to save on expenses. Since the beginning of this past week, another 20 or so silk factories have continued to cease operations. In the middle of the past week, domestic cloth merchants made some purchases, and Indian merchants covered some short positions, trading dozens of packages of yellow and white silk. The silk price has continued to weaken, and Chinese merchants are suffering losses, while foreign merchants are stagnating. There is transaction but no market for Chinese silk overseas. The raw silk market has not been extensively reported.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Sugar Market: Thai Yuan Ice Brand Price Increases <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Minhu Red Market's Stock Has Run Out, Japanese Sugar Price Declines</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's district production areas had no telegrams due to it being Sunday. The public market for the association's marked goods, Dutch sugar no. 24 granulated white sugar's purchasing enthusiasm was quiet, the market's shape was flat, and the output was still abundant. The price decreased by 8 liang and 4 qian, high at 8 liang and 4 qian and a half, but the number of ships was few. The high price of 8 liang and 4 qian had little transaction. The market was still fine. No. 20 medium white granulated sugar was 7 liang and 7 qian. The market was quite good. The late shout was 7 liang and 7 qian and a half, with no buyers. No. 10 Dutch red sugar was 7 liang and 4 qian, and the market was not strange. The Japanese sugar market declined and still had outputs in practicality. Due to Minghua factory's products being quite smooth and the high prices turning sluggish in each place, YRO mark was 7 liang 9 qian and a half to 7 liang 9 qian. YT mark was 8 liang and 4 qian and a half. TK mark was 8 liang and 5 qian and a half. YP mark was 8 liang and 9 qian. The market's image was peaceful. Thai Yuan Ice, a domestic brand, has been arriving continuously. Due to the continuous demand, the price increased by 3 qian and temporarily few buyers. Minhu Red Market's stock has run out. It is said that the production areas require the Hankou and Wuhu gangs to search for goods, but the amount is quite small. New goods must wait until one month later to meet the market demand.</p>
