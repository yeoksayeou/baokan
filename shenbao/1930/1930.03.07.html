<h3 id="c3">軍縮會議之前途 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>倫敦之軍縮會議。若依前例而言。斷無满意之結果。蓋因雖有一部分人之盡力。而人類猜疑之心。决不能無有。故世界即無野心家。而欲已之不疑人。并不受人之疑者。甚非易易也。</p>
<p>歐戰以前。各國競倡武裝和平之說。以爲武備愈修。而莫敢先發。和平乃愈可恃。及至歐戰禍起。實因武力過大之故。而其害更烈。自歐戰以後。各國有識之士。咸痛心疾首於戰禍之烈。探其原因。又痛心疾首於武備之過甚。於是歐戰一息。而减縮軍備之議。即隨之而起。今日雖尚在努力進行之中。而觀其歷次會議之情形其所得甚屬有限也。</p>
<p>今日軍縮會議。極大之阻碍。在各國藉口於自衛。而自衛之力量。究至若何程度而足。則又各國所處情形之不同而不能一致。苟不一致。則所謂縮軍者。决無一定之準則。徒以固有之實力。以爲比例。其去縮軍以止戰之義遠矣。是故世界强國。而果有縮軍之誠心。則宜不問他國之如何。而先自减縮至於無可减縮之程度而止。先樹典型爲各國則。以視開會而集議。較爲實在也。</p>

<p>▲朱家驊褚民誼提案原文</p>
<p>三中全會由朱家驊褚民誼兩委提厲行本黨敎育政策案、經敎育組審查、議决交政治會議討論、茲將提案錄下、</p>
<p>敎育爲立國之本　亦即爲一切革命建設之母、故本黨於開始訓政之際、即確定敎育之宗旨與實施方針、（兄弟三次全國代表大會、確定敎育宗旨、及其實施方針案、）使能循此途徑、切實施行、則不僅往昔之敎育惡因、立可一掃而空、即三民主義之建設基礎、亦將由是奠定、乃一年以來、變亂紛起、過去努力、所得之革命秩序與建設、幾被推毁、本黨原定之敎育政策、至此遂亦無由推進、今叛亂悉定、障碍已除、吾人于痛定恩痛之際、必須最大之决心與努力、以實現本黨之敎育政策、蓋政治與敎育、乃相輔而行、敎育之發展固有待于政治之安定、顧欲促進人民之自治之能力、造成健全之政治秩序、尤非敎育普及莫爲功也、</p>
<p>本黨之敎育政策、對於各項敎育設施、均有明確之規定、吾人爲整個國家之敎育計、自應兼籌並顧、不宜有所偏廢、惟以目前國家環境與人民之需要而論、則不可不有先後緩急之分、方今訓政伊始、本黨最大之責任、要在促進地方自治發展國民經濟而欲達到、此目的必須盡力從事于文盲之掃除、生產之增進、吾國向無精確之敎育統計、據近年調查所得全國人口、共四萬四千七百一十五萬四千元九百五十一人、失學兒童約計四千二百五十六萬餘人、失學成人、約計二萬一千一十六萬餘人、全國失學者合計約二萬五千二百七十二萬餘人、此種調查、未見十分眞確、故實際言之、恐尚不止此數、即據此而論、則全國人民之不識宇者、亦超過半數以上、以大多數未受敎育之人民、而欲其實行自治使民權、其爲不可能之事、實彰明甚、吾國經濟落後、生產能率日趨低落、即以糧食而言、據民國十六年海關調查關於米麥麵三項之輸入、總値竟有一萬三千五百六十萬五千兩之鉅、吾國向以農產充裕自豪、而其結果、竟至如此、洵可浩嘆、故今日如欲挽救國民經濟之破產、必先努力從事于生產能率之增進、基此兩大需要、吾人認爲目前必須急切施行之根本敎育、厥爲以養成國民生活技能爲中心之國民義務敎育成人補習敎育與職業敎育是已、</p>
<p>惟欲實施國民義務敎育與成人補習敎育、必須先有廣大師資之養成、以每二十五萬人需一敎員之標準、則須有一千萬以上之敎員、始足敷用、如此鉅大需要、自非多設專校、無以濟事、且此種敎師、負有國家特殊使命、應受特殊之訓練不能與普通敎育等量齊觀、故今後之師範學校、應獨立設置不得作其他學校之附庸、並須增長年限加緊訓練改善待遇、提高小學敎師新俸、以造成師範敎育之健全基礎、同時對于現任之小學敎員及私塾塾師、須利用假期、逐年分别加以訓練、蓋良好小學假資之缺乏、至今成爲極大問題、據浙江敎育廳十七年度之統計、全省小學敎員、曾受師範敎育者、僅占百分之四十一、其餘百分之五十九、均係未受師範敎育者、一般私塾塾師尚不在内、此種、合格之敎師、若加以嚴厲之取締、則恐在此靑黃不接之際、失學者人數將更增多、故吾人不得不爲之積極籌劃稍補救之道也、</p>
<p>職業敎育向爲吾國所忽視、各省舉辦之各種職業學校、類皆以書本爲主、缺乏實騐之設備、且與當地生產環境、不相呼應、畢業後又無適當之岀路與保障、故其所得之效果、直等於零、今後吾人必需力矯前弊、對於學校之設立、須以適應當地生產需要爲主要條件、於工業區域内、設置實騐工廠、於農業區域内、設置農業試騐塲、一方面爲學生實習之用、一方面即爲改造當地生產之張本、並爲之預籌生活岀路與確實保障、使能達到人盡其才、地盡其利、特盡其用貨、暢其流之目的、同時於軍隊中實施職業敎育、以爲他日墾殖築路及其他生產之用、此不僅可以化分利爲生利、且爲消弭戰禍救亡挽危之根本大計也、</p>
<p>本黨之敎育政策、以敎育機會平等爲基本原則、顧目前之學校敎育、顯爲少數有財者之專利、一般貧寒子弟、不僅無受中等敎育之望、即欲領受小學敎育亦不可能此種畸形敎育制度、設不根本打破、則普及敎育之目的永難達到故吾人主張全國學校應一律免費、使貧寒靑年各得舒展天才、惟以現今財政困難、一時實現勢所難能祇得先將團民義務學校成人補習學校及師範學校免除納費、其餘中等以上之學交先設免費學額若干名、逐年增加、俟敎費充實時、再行全免、對於有志研究高深學術者、國家亦應資助奬勵之此爲實行本黨敎育政策之最低必要條件、否則雖欲厲行普及敎育其如事實不許何、　　最後吾人急須根本解决者、即爲敎育經費問題敎育經費、若無充分之準備與保障、則一切計劃皆成畫餅、以目前敎育經費之狀况而論不僅不足以推行本黨之敎育政策、即欲維持現狀恐亦不易、故吾人爲治標計、須先將已經確定之敎育經費、至治本之策、中央及各省應規定歲收百分之二十至三十爲敎育經費、并須確立獨立保障制度、且須打破過去（以地方之欵辦地方敎育）之謬誤觀念、由中央統籌計劃使各地敎育平均發展夫能如是然後本黨之敎育政策、始得貫澈實現、（未完）</p>

<p>（三）即將舉辦業務</p>
<p>一·增加市校學級、本市義務敎育、現尚未能普及、各市立學校、宜增設學級、以免報名學生額满見遺、本局於每學期開始時、必擇市校中報名學生最多者、酌量添設學級、惟尚不能盡數收容、仍須陸續添辦、當於經濟可能範圍内、盡力增加、以期減少失學兒童、</p>

<p>（四）困難</p>
<p>一·敎育權未能統一</p>
<p>（一）租界敎育權　本特别市内、劃有租界、事權不能統一、辦理不免困難、一般宗旨不在敎育之私立學校、托庇租界、貽害靑年、本局予以取締有陽奉陰違者、有遷地避匿者、因之租界内直無敎育可言、是非收回租界敎育權、殊不易澈底整頓、</p>
<p>（二）省敎育權　本特别市不屬省範圍、係受國府直轄之行政區域、而市區内設有省立學校、且本市應接收之敎育欵產、迄今尚未完全移交、此亦職權之不統一、有碍業務之進行、</p>
<p>二·敎育經費的竭蹶</p>
<p>本市人口稠密、工商繁盛、學校敎育與社會敎育、均待積極推廣、事業旣多、經費亦增、年來本市敎育經費雖迭經增加、而按諸應辦事業尚覺竭蹶不易支配、因之預算一再删減、不免削足適履、是經濟不裕、實亦發展敎育之困難、</p>
<p>（五）希望</p>
<p>三·望黨部市民合作</p>
<p>敎育關係立國根本、本局職責所在、當殫精竭慮以圖發展、尤望黨部領導市民與市府恊力合作、使本市敎育日臻發達、</p>
<p>二·望敎育權統一</p>
<p>事權不一、政令紛歧、均妨碍敎育事業之進行、本市敎育行政、頗感掣肘、一切設施、未能貫澈、深望本市内敎育權早日統一、以利敎育行政功能（完）</p>

<p>在今日之娱樂器具。可以麻醉全國。浸淫而及於大西洋者。厥惟雀戲。友人顧子南吿以最近十日中。關於雀戲之小新聞二則。爰輯之爲新雀語如下。</p>
<p>此中有良緣。有陳永全者。於前星期二。爲人祝壽。被座客强拉。加入雀戰團。永全素怯陣。蓋爲經濟壓迫之故。是日共碰十二圈。所負不及一袁頭。然已額汗如汽蒸。而面色同猪肝矣。昨乃聞人吿子南。謂永全已得嬌妻。將於再下之星期日（三月十六）行婚禮矣。子南更訪其究竟。始知良緣之在此中也。當日雀戰方酣。永全之上家當莊。碰四萬吃七萬。而下家一女郎於最初發張時。已將中風首先擲去。永全則以一中連換成三。迨局勢緊張。竟拆一中風。聽五八萬呌。自摸得和。女郎所聽爲嵌六萬。衆皆咎永全無此拆法。女郎笑曰。是何言。莊家已顯然爲清一色。舍中風一抬。免放大銃。是眞穏而健也。一老者負手立女郎後。極口和之。聚餐時絮絮問永全家計與生活現狀。蓋老者固女郎之父。知女心已折。故迎刃以成其良緣也。越日而倩媒。不三日而約定。岀一中風而成好事。奇矣。故曰。此中有良緣。</p>
<p>得一萬失一千　子南又曰。事之有幸有不幸。不可以常理論也。永全雀戰之明日。余因事訪友於西門。適友人在雀陣中。因旁立入觀戰團。一客聽三六九同。忽留所摸之狐一萬。拆出九同。舍三叫而聽一呌。手轉兩匝。亦竟自摸得和。有笑其不諳牌理者。有羨其手風大旺者。其對家之背後人。則曰。神乎技矣。何竟如見耶。蓋對家白板成坎中風碰岀。聽一四萬已久。而竟遭此蹉跌也。其人亦自鳴得意。孜孜不倦。述其何時已知對方有抬頭。何時又知其聽萬字呌。余不耐久候。即自去。今聞對家啣之甚深。雙方本有合資營業之事。其數一千元。現乃托辭解約。未訂合同。亦不受悔約之束縛。豈非得一萬失一千乎。其人姓名。則未暇問。子南亦未及之。斯人何不幸。而陳永全眞僥倖矣。</p>
<h3 id="c80">樹中發現鳥形之珍聞 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 斅厂</p>
<p>日前赴同學程君家喜宴。席次。聞程君之舅王保田君。述樹中發現鳥形事。洵珍聞也。爰轉錄於此。以供海内博學家之研究。</p>
<p>王君年逾耳顺。臨安北鄕產。世業販樹。距今三十年前。君赴於潛販樹。以二百金販得栗樹一塊。中有一樹。生長山谷間。長三丈許。身圍三尺一二寸。名曰鳥不停。因該樹枝葉上满生芒剌。鳥不能停。故名。而王君嘗聞其先人言。鳥不停身圍二尺者。樹中即有鳥形。惟此種樹大者極少。因其質異常堅密。不易生長。凡身圍尺許者。非百年以上不可。因之王君旣得該樹。遂去其梢枝。剖之爲二。以覘究竟。詎樹中果有鳥形數十頭。姿勢各不相同。散布於樹之中段丈許之間。君大喜。遂將剖開之樹。各截取中段之有鳥形者。舁之歸家。擬復剖成薄板如干塊。惟已剖之鳥形。甚爲糢糊。不無缺憾。事爲王君同業某叟所悉。迺語王曰。以鋸剖樹。剖之稍久。則鋸必熱。凡剖現有鳥形之樹。切忌鋸熱。蓋鋸一熱。則樹中之鳥形</p>
<p>必致糢糊。然欲免此弊。剖時宜備鋸數柄。稍剖即換一柄。如是循環輪換。則鋸不致生熱也。王君如其言復剖。則鳥形果甚清晣。誠希有之珍。該樹除去邊外。共剖得三分板二十五塊。各板兩面。均有鳥形。王君一一岀售。（用以製屏風及桌面。頗爲名貴。每塊售銀五六十元不等。中有四塊。爲新登令某購去孝敬上司者。合計價銀四百十元。此樹總計獲銀一千五百餘元。君家本寒。自得此利後。遂漸寛裕。今則薄具資產。頗堪温飽云。</p>

<p>— 景白</p>
<p>歐風東漸。自由戀愛自由結婚之聲浪。常盪漾於吾人之耳鼓。靑年士女。亦均奉爲圭臬。而舊式婚姻制度。父母之命。媒妁之言。若語與今之靑年。無不掩耳却走。嗤之以鼻也。不謂老友袁君。以極新之人物。近行舊式之結婚。其結果甜蜜美满。遂發爲極雋妙之言論。君房語妙。烏可不記。</p>
<p>老友袁君。攻讀於某中學。敏慧好學。成績冠其儔。最近舉行結婚佳禮。次日同學數十人。恭往致賀。不侫亦躬逢其勝。飽飫盛宴之餘。羣强新郎宣布結婚經過。與第一夜秘密。袁君舉目四矚。室無他人。盡屬學友。笑傲嘲謔。習于平時。乃無所用其忸怩。遂赤裸裸宣布於下。同人等靜氣恭聆。較之課室受業。其專心一致。奚啻霄壤。袁君復命洗盞更酌以備載言載飲。漢書可以下酒。雋語實足加餐。於是袁君笑容盎面。發其妙論曰。人謂舊式婚姻。爲盲目婚姻制。余則以爲大謬。蓋自由戀愛。迨至結婚。即是宣布戀愛終點。無可再進。乃至索然乏味。發生不幸者。比比皆是。惟舊式結婚。還是戀愛起點。閨房韻事。將有加靡已。至云結婚經過。旣爲舊式。則無所謂經過。然第一夜之愉快。則永不能忘。夜闌人靜。步入洞房。有美一人。靚妝默坐。仰視明月在天。三星入户。遂疑廣寒宮殿。未必在雲間也。乃徐旁其座。徐引其語。伊則嬌羞。若不勝情。於是携手入韓。其中情况。祇可與此中人語。不足爲外人道也。反之自由結婚。則輕車熟道。能如是神秘愉快乎。同人泰半此道未經。其言騐否。誌之以爲他日之左券可也。</p>

<p>黎明時家家傳呼　翌日黎明時。即爲隔鄰叩門聲所驚起。詢之。則爲警察家家傳呼鼓女也。余等遂急起團漱。</p>
<p>會塲王莊嚴整肅　是日抽籤會塲。設於榮華戲館。佔座不多。主此事者之公安局科長俞濟民。已先余在。見余至。即引人記者席上。並吿我抽廢之籌備情形。斯時會塲上頗莊嚴整肅。妓女到者。已有數十人。均分坐前排。其　母娘姨等。則分坐樓上包廂。台前懸有一聯。句云。（惜葉葉花花。鬭艶競　。紛飛北里隋污　。願鶯鶯燕燕。爭先恐後。齊祝東風集上林。）句雖不工。尚饒興味。台左對照片之席後。遍列紅色鮮花。以備廢妓佩懸之標識。紅綾上書有八字云。（脫離火坑恢復人格。）亦頗警惕。</p>
<p>警惕有趣之標語　會塲四週。遍貼標語。句多警惕而有趣。如（抽廢的妓女是祖宗蔭德積下來的。）（一經抽廢仍是清白女兒身。）（從此得見天日。）（年老色衰覺悟已不及了）等語。</p>
<p>麥克一語閧堂笑　開落後。主席李子裁致演詞畢。即由各機關相繼演說。復有民政廳警務顧問麥克氏演說。麥不慣華語。用英語發言。一言甫畢。已引得四座閧堂矣。</p>
<p>此次應廢之人數　此次應廢妓女人數。查拱埠一等妓女原有三十八人。除已停業者三名。包賬者十二名外。應以二十三名内抽六分之一。計廢四名。二等妓女二百九十七名。除包賑者百二十八名外。應以百六十九名内抽廢六分之一。計抽二十八名。兩共三十一名云。</p>
<p>抽籤之手續精密　籤以竹製。書就廢留二種。外各包以白紙。取籤時須破封察視。由各妓女自行抽取。其辦法洵精細而嚴密也。</p>
<p>抽籤時趣聞種種　當抽廢時。會塲趣聞頗多。茲摘錄一二如下。（一）一等妓楚楚。是日因患天花未到。經證明屬實。準由鴇母代抽。不料竟廢。於是此六十餘歲之老鴇。遂暫時代妓身受矣。（二）二等妓林芝草。年已五十許。平日仍以聲歌應酬。是日亦抽得廢字。一朶紅花佩襟。觀者大笑。（三）二等妓紅弟。年二十八歲。在祝張氏處爲包賑夥計。是日衣長裙短襖至。態度從容。當傳喚時。對騐照者曰。儂已還清包賑。自願從良。現請繳還照會。隨客（即其愛人）還家云云。</p>
<p>被抽後何必垂淚　是日被抽廢之妓女。無不下淚痛哭。至有伏地大哭不起者。噫。此其受環境所包圍歟。抑又本性使然歟。余誠莫解。</p>
<p>濟良所哭聲震地　事後余復赴濟良所參觀。至則哭聲震地。慘不忍聞。間有識我者。更牽衣求救。余笑曰。汝等跳岀火坑。正歡樂之不遑。何哀慟爲。行見雙雙恩客。來娶汝等返家團聚矣。衆妓聞語。猶將信將疑。嗣由婦恊會代表林松王薇二女士相繼演說。諄諄勸吿。始各收淚感謝。破涕爲笑。</p>
<p>事後各方面瑣聞　記者岀濟良所後。復赴茶樓小坐。則街談巷議。傳說紛紜。記之亦有數種。（一）一等妓楚楚。本以親女爲妓。現被抽廢。負債達四千元。（二）二等妓劉秀英。雖係自做。但以平時揮霍甚奢。負債亦達九百餘元。（三）文君。爲二等妓中之翹楚。家有父母。垂垂老矣。幼子則尚在襁褓。平日均賴其爲生。一旦被抽。家中老父母。咸哀感欲絶。（四）二等妓妙雲。營業頗盛。且善積蓄。已儲有五百餘金。而又戀棧不忍離此火坑。此番被抽。亦可謂自尋煩惱矣。</p>
<h3 id="c84">杭州廢娼後之怪劇 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— 松盧自杭寄</p>
<p>杭州市政府爲提高女權。解放婦女起見。爰有抽籤廢娼之舉。其經過情形。已於昨稿報吿之矣。乃不料奇變之來。竟有岀人意外者。蓋被廢之妓女。寄留濟良所中。已爲鴇等一陣哄閙。刦奪一空。事誠駭人聽聞。爰探述其經過。快郵寄投自由談。</p>
<p>先是。公安局對於廢娼之善後辦法。嚴守秘密。故當時妓女之被廢者。莫不縱淚痛哭。一若濟良所中之痛苦。有甚於牢獄然。及抽籤後。此四十餘之廢妓。遂一併送人濟良所。而該所之房屋。頗爲仄狹。至是乃有屋少人多。坐難容膝之感。同時妓院等之龜鴇等。復四岀求援。紛紛要求暫行取保。三區署長戴述銘。以情有可原。遂准予所請。一時保岀者。多至二十餘人。事爲公安局第二科長俞濟民所聞。大不謂然。云妓旣被廢。何得暫保。囑仍一一吊回。送人所中。而一般龜鴇等聆此消息。以爲官廳岀爾反爾。頗形憤激。同時謠傳復盛。謂此輩廢妓。將解送入城。於是邀集當地流氓暴徒。實行往濟良所刦奪。果爾。濟良所一無防備。遂爲打門人内。將各妓刦奪一空。事後。區署方面派警追捕。竟一無所獲。乃勒令各妓院之龜鴇繳人。而妓院則　爲事變發生於濟良所。殊難負責追尋云。截至發稿時。尚未有妥善辦法。但拱埠彈丸之地。交通不甚便利。且妓女最易認别。必不難一云一弋獲也。</p>

<p>（四）在戲院裏</p>
<p>除電影院以外、在上海專演舞台劇的戲院、連各游藝塲的京劇部在内、大約有十二三家、每一個戲院裏的坐位、從幾百起到一二千不等、因之每天晚上各戲院年吸收的觀衆、統計起來、也很可觀哩、中國舊劇塲裏面的佈置、比了從前、的確進步得多、舞台·背景·座位·裝飾等等、改良的地方可就不少、單就茶壼手巾而論、也似乎潔白了許多、不過眼睛裏的紅顏色、緑顏色、耳朶裏的叫喊聲、喧閙聲、仍舊保持着原有的精神、</p>
<p>戲院是娱樂的場所、看客們决不是因爲他們的身體没有地方存放、纔跑到戲院裏去（暫寄）若干小時、我們上戲院子聽戲、至少要求視聽的快樂、身心的安適罷、可是在上海這樣大的都市裏、一般戲院所給我們的感想怎樣、從大門進去直到從大門岀來、你的眼睛·耳朶·鼻子·喉嚨·手足·總之四肢百體、都要受四週緊張的空氣所保圍、</p>
<p>我們不談戲院裏的定座問題、因爲有許多問題一時也說不了、單說一個要求身心娱樂的看客、他在戲院裏、臉上所給我們的表示怎樣、譬如有一個人去看戲、當他還没有踏進大門的時候、那接客的（案目）一見了、就像認識似的、嘴裏哼着、引他進去、不過照例先向客人問、有没有定座、或者說（是不是一客）、如果這個客人早已定了座位、上面所說的就是例外了、</p>
<p>進了場子、客人一定揀聽得清楚、看得仔細的、方向走去、然而結果是（先生、對不起、這裏已經定去了、）於是看客的臉上就有些不自然的表示、如果戲院裏生意太好、那末這位客人的臉上就格外的難看、有時候接客的領了客人在院子裏兜到東兜到西、客人的臉上一忽爾沉着、一忽爾緊張、好像一個人在臨時法院裏、跟了庭丁走着一樣、他的臉上和他的心裏怎樣、也就可想而知了、</p>
<p>終久坐位找到了、在案目方面已經是煞費苦心、在客人方面却還委曲得很、尤其是人數多的、總免不了幾句應有的爭執、倘或爭執的焦點涉及票價或者金錢、那没毘接的幾排觀衆們、就連帶的要</p>
<p>感覺着不安、除非去定座一個包廂、可以有比較的舒適以外、在什麽廳、什麽樓裏、總有若干的地方使人縐眉、最討厭的、就是大家本不相識的、在有一個時期裏、莫名其妙的要（起立迎送、）譬如一排十六個坐位、兩端的五六個都已佔去了、祇餘了中間的四五個、如果有人入座、兩端坐着的人、就要站起身來、讓他進去、來三個人要讓三次、還不算煩麻、最使你無可如何的、就是你的貴鄰、如果離座小便、那麽你在三分鐘裏、就要恭送恭迎的起立兩次、至於你的貴鄰、在四五小時的長時期中、是否祇有一次的解溲、還是個問題、</p>
<p>因爲戲院裏排坐位的時候、像稻田裏揷秧一樣的節省土地、每排的坐位都是擠得無可再擠、不要說肥胖的人、岀進要喊（對不住）、就是身材較小的、在岀進的時候、帶脫帽子、翻落茶壼等類的把戲、也不算希罕、至於前後一排一排的坐位、每一隻位置和前後的一隻、都成一根直線、如看客一個個的端正坐着、那末幾十個頭也就成了一根垂直線、坐在樓下的看客、往往側着肩架、從前面兩個人頭中間窺着看、不過戲台的方向遠、人頭的所在近、後面的看客從前面客人的雙頭中望去、就像在兩個山峯中間看白雲一樣的吃力、</p>
<p>戲院裏的色彩·聲音·無所不用其極、强烈的燈光、鮮紅大緑的顏色、照着眼睛、往往不酸自眠、戲台上的聲音不用說、是客人們金錢的代價、震耳的鼓鑼、岀了院子還在耳朶根邊蕩繞着不過台下的聲音、其來源就難以解釋了、最普通的有小孩子的哭叫聲、有先生們的咳嗆聲、有小販喊買糖山楂聲、有敲茶壼蓋叫茶房和茶房接客互相招呼的各種聲音、</p>
<p>拿看戲的目光、移到墻壁上、登着許多廣吿、差不多像一張放大的報紙、尤其是什麽壯···避···經···梅···補···咳等類、都市裏的病態、明白地表演地墻壁上、而戲台上還演着十五世紀的戲、有一次、一家戲院裏演着（新長板埔、）糜夫人懷裏抱的劉阿斗、却是一個洋娃娃、肥白的手足、金黃的頭髮、還帶上一副蔚藍的眼睛、台下一個小孩子、拍手的喊着洋娃娃不止、在下不知怎的、轉了一個念頭、好像說、（小劉是斯拉夫族）罷、</p>

<p>上星期五、滬西憶定盤路上、在慘淡的燈光下、有一個長髮男子、穿着半長不短的衣服、瑟瑟縮縮地走着、他的頭不定的東張西望、好像恐怕被人看見的一樣、走了不到兩百碼的地方、迎面來了一羣抄靶子的巡捕、他嚇得低下頭拼命望前走、他這樣恐慌的態度、證明他幹了什麽違法的事情、同時引起巡捕的疑心、喝住道、（你望那兒跑）、</p>
<p>（我···我···我回家去、）他顫着聲音地回答、</p>
<p>你身穿的是嗶嘰長袍嗎、有花紋没有、</p>
<p>不、是緞的、有花、</p>
<p>有多少錢在皮袋裏、</p>
<p>有幾十塊錢、</p>
<p>唉、來到這裏燈下看看···哦、原來上嗶嘰的、那裏有花···爾不是個好貨、搜他身···咳、祇有十二塊錢、這些錢那兒來、巨大的手掌接連的送到他的臉上來了、</p>
<p>這···這是在某某女塾偷來的、他忍不住疼痛的回答、</p>
<p>一羣巡捕就擁到某某女塾、叩着門進去一查、原來是男敎員宿舍失竊、陸先生的房間窗户已半開了、</p>
<p>噲、開門、包探要進去察看、這樣叫着、</p>
<p>半夜三更怎甚、室中人問着、</p>
<p>我是包探、你們有東西失竊嗎、</p>
<p>没有、别閙、你規矩懂麽、半夜三更、叩門是不可以的、</p>
<p>我本來是這樣的、甚麽叫做規矩、我是不懂的、</p>
<p>我現在敎你、半夜不許閙、就是規矩　　你别擺先生架子吧、我帮爾捉到賊子了、快些開門吧、</p>
<p>陸先生逼得没法、起來開門、在燈光下發現置在牀頭的皮箱、已不知道在什麽時候、被人打開了、新置的嗶嘰皮袍、已不翼而飛了、</p>

<p>（喂、酋長、你把我的遣駭埋葬了吧）幽靈對馬來酋長這麽說、</p>
<p>（你是什麽人啊、你的尸骸在那裏呀、）馬來酋長的夢魂應着、</p>
<p>（我是唐人、我是跟三保大人一道南來的唐人、我很不幸地在半途死亡了、因此、他們便把我丢下海去海葬了、可是我却被海潮冲送到這裏來、我的尸體曾夾着在海灘的岩石隙裏、暴露着已經有二天了、）</p>
<p>（晤、原來是這麽的一回事、可是我不能答應你要我這樣做、而且、我也不高興去幹這種烏事體、）</p>
<p>（啊、你不高興、便不答應了嗎、我勸你、還是動手幹了乾凈些、不然、再過三天、尸體怕要腐爛了、那時、你們馬來人、說不定會發生了疫症的、）</p>
<p>（那没有什麽關係的、因爲你是唐人、我們是信奉回敎的、不吃猪肉的馬來人、就是我不去把你的尸體埋葬了、天帝也不會懲罰我們的何况你又是一個吃猪肉、叛逆了天帝的唐人呢、）</p>
<p>（好吧、隨你的便吧、但是我的一番好意、對你述說、你不相信我也不能使你相信的、等着看吧、再會啊、）幽靈說着、消逝了、</p>
<p>迨酋長醒來時、他以爲是一個惡夢而已、因之便不去介意了、</p>
<p>三天過去了、這荒島開始發生疫病了、馬來酋長這時記起他的惡夢了、可是他的兵民、死的、却已死了不少、他也想不岀什麽方法來、他祇好聽天由命了、</p>
<p>一天、正是六月三十日吧、三保太監竟到了南方的這個荒島了、馬來酋長很高興地歡迎他、因爲他想在三保太監處得到一種避疫的方法、他看見三保太監帶來的二三萬的兵民、竟没有一個沾着這種病的、於是、他開始請求三保太監給他指敎了、</p>
<p>（你還是把他的尸體、埋葬了吧、）三保太監只這樣的對他說了一句話、</p>
<p>後來、酋長遵命去做了、果然不兩天、這荒島裏的土人、一個也不見患沾着這麽的病症了、自此以後、這荒島裏的土人、還給那個死者、建造了一個廟宇、敬予香火、據說那時的那個死者、就是現在南洋華僑所稱爲（太伯公）的那菩薩、至於這荒島是什麽地方呢、聽說便是現在荷屬的三保壟呀、</p>

<p>▲ Meeting Circumstances</p>
<p>The meeting commenced at 3 PM. The committee members and representatives from various Yuan, ministries, and commissions entered the auditorium in an orderly fashion. After the Central Committee members took their seats, Yu Youren was elected as Chairman. The Premier's Will was respectfully read, followed by three minutes of silence. Subsequently, Chairman Yu delivered the closing remarks. After the remarks, Shao Lizi read the Assembly Declaration in a cold tone. The ceremony concluded with music, and the attendees dispersed.</p>
<p>▲ Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Yu Youren delivered the closing remarks as follows: "Fellow comrades, brothers, I have been ill for a long time, so I could not speak much. Today, the Third Plenary Session has held its closing ceremony. I remember Mr. Hu saying during the opening that although the Third Plenary Session is a routine meeting, its significance is very important. He hoped that all comrades would work hard to complete its mission. We recall that in the history of our party, since the First National Congress, it happened to coincide with Chen Jiongming's rebellion, the Beiyang warlords' attack, and the imperialists' attack. The Premier at that time believed that as long as the party was sound, everything else did not matter. Therefore, the First Congress was held amidst difficulties and hardships. Later, the rebels and warlords were gradually suppressed. Although this plenary session is not as important as the National Congress, its task is also very important at this time of tense situation. Now that the proposals have been passed, I hope they will be implemented in order and achieve great results. At this time, the reactionary warlords do not know what doctrine is, nor what party is. We must recognize that the country now needs unity and peace. Now that the conference has adjourned, at this important time, the government should take its inherent responsibility to curb the chaos, such as the reactionary warlords in the north, such as Yan Xishan and his ilk, one by one to be suppressed, so that many suffering people know the party's power and the benefits of the central government. Finished."</p>
<p>▲ Assembly Declaration</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Third Plenary Session issued a declaration, stating: "After the Third National Congress of our party, in accordance with the Premier's teachings, determined the major plans for party-state construction during the period of political tutelage, the Central Executive Committee, at its first and second plenary sessions, had successively planned the phased implementation of major party and government affairs and vowed with a firm determination of perseverance to work together with all party comrades and the people of the country to promote the concrete realization of the Three Principles of the People. In recent months, party comrades and the government, both upper and lower levels, have followed this principle and advanced in different directions. What they have been committed to is to seek peaceful unification and to gather the strength of political tutelage and construction, and at the same time to seek to deeply plant the foundation of unification and peace through political tutelage and construction. Although the remnant warlords and counter-revolutionary forces have repeatedly tried to disrupt, causing harm to peace and unification and hindering political tutelage and construction, the more peace and unification are harmed, the firmer the people's determination to support peace and unification; the more obstacles political tutelage and construction suffer, the more eagerly the people desire political tutelage and construction. Our party deeply understands that the people's wishes and our party's policies have merged and are tending towards unity. Therefore, it specially convened the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee to conduct a precise assessment and discussion of the various party and government plans that have been diligently promoted and implemented in stages over the past few months, in order to establish more practical and concrete methods for the future, so that our party's doctrines and policies can be transformed from plans into facts, and the people's wishes can be transformed from words into national policies. Since the opening of the meeting, all the discussions and decisions, such as the promotion of party affairs, the rectification of politics, the implementation of economic construction, and the implementation of education based on the Three Principles of the People, have been based on the party and government strategies that have been promoted in the past, and more substantial and concrete methods and steps have been determined. However, there is something that this conference should tell all party comrades and the people of the country: the doctrines and strategies set by the Premier are not entrusted to empty words but are embodied in facts, not only applied to the country's laws and decrees but also seen in the actual lives of the people. Therefore, our party comrades and the people of the country must, from now on, with a spirit of tireless perseverance, concentrate all their efforts on local autonomy work, so that the Three Principles of the People can sprout and grow from the social life of the people, and then there will be practical meaning in the righteousness of revolution and national salvation. Because of the decline of today's society and the impoverishment of the people's livelihoods, there is no way to save the declining and suffering people except by having all party comrades devote themselves to the actual social undertakings of the people, and the revitalization of actual social undertakings has no path to start except by supporting local autonomy. Therefore, the reason why party affairs must be concentrated on governing counties and local social undertakings below the county is this first meaning. If we want to seek the revitalization of social undertakings, we must rely on the power of the government to develop the country's financial resources, and then the social economy can be smoothed. Therefore, economic construction cannot be delayed. The Premier's plan for material construction, our party has determined the plan to develop various basic industries based on it. In the future, we should, based on the plan for developing various basic industries, according to the urgency of the needs of the people in various provinces and the thickness of the national financial resources, the protection of domestic industry and commerce, the dredging of rivers in the Northwest provinces, and the holding of other electrical, water conservancy, and railway projects, make detailed plans and vigorously implement them. Because the crisis of the current social economy is becoming more and more urgent, we must use the thoughts and financial resources of the whole country, on the one hand, strictly practice frugality, and on the other hand, use foreign machinery and technology, to quickly achieve the effect of construction and relieve the suffering of the people's livelihoods. This is the second meaning. The circular advancement of local social undertakings and national economic construction must rely on the popularization of education based on the Three Principles of the People among the people. Only education can promote society, and only education can cultivate national strength. Therefore, the efforts in the future must not only establish a society based on the Three Principles of the People through education but also enrich the country based on the Three Principles of the People through education. Without this, the nation-building power that the Chinese nation should have cannot be fully stretched. This is the third meaning. From these meanings, this conference believes that the political life of China in the future must rely on the vigorous promotion of local autonomy, economic construction, and the popularization of education based on the Three Principles of the People, so as to present a lively and substantial new opportunity. For more than a decade, the politics accumulated due to feudal ideas and warlord separatism must not only make every effort to eliminate its remaining poison in the future, but also replace its entire structure and life with the substantive construction of the Three Principles of the People. We must make the Three Principles of the People a practical social organization and national construction, and then China will have enlightened politics, the people will have happy and prosperous lives, and the international equal status can be consolidated. May all our party comrades and the people of the country understand this purpose and work together to achieve it. This declaration is hereby made."</p>

<p>A Total of Twenty-Three Resolutions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 8 AM on the 6th, the Fifth General Assembly of the Third Plenary Session was held. Forty-six committee members attended. Hu Hanmin presided over the meeting. The following resolutions were passed:</p>
<p>(1) Resolution: The proposal by Kong Xiangxi, Sun Ke, and Liu Jiwen to raise funds for the construction of the capital was approved in principle and submitted to the Political Council.</p>
<p>(2) Kong Xiangxi's proposal to increase work efficiency, develop industrial production, enlighten workers' knowledge, protect workers' physical strength, connect workers, and stipulate the standards for labor groups during the period of political tutelage was submitted to the Standing Committee.</p>
<p>(3) The proposal by Jiao Yitang, Chen Zhaoying, Lin Sen, and seven other committee members to have the government establish large factories in various provinces to accommodate unemployed people was approved in principle and submitted to the Central Political Council.</p>
<p>(4) Zhu Jiahua's proposal to implement frugal administration was approved in principle and submitted to the Central Political Council.</p>
<p>(5) Ye Chucang and six other committee members' proposal on the applicable standards for the committee system was submitted to the Central Political Council.</p>
<p>(6) Jiao Yitang and Chen Zhaoying's proposal that the Central Government send people to various provinces and counties for on-site inspections was resolved. It was already stipulated in Item C of the "Party Affairs Progress Plan during the Period of Political Tutelage" at the Second Sixth Meeting of this session, Clause 1 of "Connecting the Relationship between the Central and Local Party Headquarters", and it was practically stipulated. It was submitted to the Standing Committee to check and implement the previous plan.</p>
<p>(7) Kong Weixiangxi's proposal to recruit as many comrades as possible who had worked hard for the revolution in the past to jointly take responsibility was resolved to have the same meaning as the proposal to support comrades and increase construction efficiency, and there was no need to discuss it again.</p>
<p>(8) The proposal by Liu Jiwen, Lin Yunhai, and Liu Wendao that the name and organization of special party headquarters should be determined at the same time as the city system was resolved that the party and the government have their own systems and cannot change their names due to changes in the affiliation of institutions under any one system.</p>
<p>(9) The Political Council's proposal to clearly define the powers stipulated in the organizational laws of various ministries and commissions to avoid mutual conflicts and facilitate progress was resolved: (1) Regarding water conservancy and electrical matters, after the relevant ministries and commissions have agreed on the methods, the organizational laws may not be modified.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding tobacco prohibition matters, all national tobacco prohibition matters shall be handled by the Tobacco Prohibition Committee, and the powers regarding tobacco prohibition matters in Article 11, Clause 8 of the internal organizational law shall be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>(3) Except for specific items, forestry and mining matters shall be handled by the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, and its organizational law and chronology shall be amended according to this principle.</p>
<p>(10) Dai Chuanxian and eight other committee members proposed to add an item to the appendix of the "Party Affairs Work Plan during the Period of Political Tutelage" passed at the third meeting of this conference and to change the order of the original items. The resolution was: (1) Add the first item to the appendix of the original plan as follows: In the resolution on the progress of party affairs during the period of political tutelage at the Second Plenary Session of this session, it is stipulated that the county government shall implement local autonomy and construction.</p>

<h3 id="e3">The Future of the Disarmament Conference <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>If the London Disarmament Conference follows the previous examples, it will definitely not have satisfactory results. This is because, despite the efforts of some people, the suspicion in human hearts can never be eliminated. Therefore, even if there are no ambitious people in the world, it is very difficult to not suspect others and not be suspected by others.</p>
<p>Before the European War, various countries advocated the theory of armed peace, believing that the more military preparations were made, the less dared anyone to strike first, and the more reliable peace would be. By the time the European War broke out, it was actually because the military force was too great, and its harm was even more severe. Since the European War, enlightened people in various countries have been heartbroken by the intensity of the war. Exploring the reasons, they are also heartbroken by the excessive military preparations. Therefore, as soon as the European War ended, the discussion of reducing armaments arose accordingly. Although it is still in the process of making efforts today, the situation of its previous meetings shows that its gains are very limited.</p>
<p>Today, the greatest obstacle to the disarmament conference is that various countries use self-defense as an excuse. However, to what extent is the power of self-defense sufficient? This is different depending on the situation of each country and cannot be consistent. If it is not consistent, then the so-called disarmament will have no certain criteria. It only uses its inherent strength as a proportion, which is far from the meaning of disarmament to stop war. Therefore, if the world's powers really have the sincere intention of disarmament, they should not ask how other countries are doing, but first reduce their own to the point where it is impossible to reduce any more. First, set an example for other countries, which is more practical than opening a meeting and gathering for discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The county party headquarters should be in a guiding and supervising position when working and should provide publicity and promotion assistance. The meaning of this provision is to clearly explain that the county party headquarters should provide publicity and promotion assistance to the county government to support local autonomy and construction work. In order to implement the guidance and supervision of local autonomy, each item in the first section of this case is to explain the implementation content of this method. Each county party headquarters should strictly abide by and strive for its own work. If the county government's promotion is deemed inappropriate, it should strictly abide by the provisions on the limits of authority of the party headquarters and the government for political tutelage in the same resolution and report to the superior party headquarters, which will then transfer it to the superior government for handling. (2) The first and second items of the original appendix should be changed to the third and fourth items, and the numbers of items A and B should be changed to a certain section.</p>
<p>(11) The Party Affairs Group's proposal to review the opinions on the work reports of the three departments of the Central Organization, Propaganda, and Training Departments and to ask for a public decision was resolved: (A) Regarding the Central Organization Department, 1. The organization and training of central and county mass organizations should be handled by the Training Department. However, if the training affairs of special city masses are more complicated and approved by the Central Government, a Mass Training Committee may be established to preside over them. The secondary system is determined by the local government. Since the implementation of the methods, it has been proper. 2. The assessment methods for the work of party headquarters at all levels have been proper since their implementation. 3. Among the total number of party headquarters in counties and cities across the country and overseas party headquarters, formal party headquarters have passed more than half. This is a good phenomenon that lower-level party headquarters are gradually stabilizing. However, in the future, we must supervise party headquarters at all levels, improve their organization, and earnestly strive for social undertakings in accordance with the various party affairs work plans and regulations set by the Central Government, and the Central Government will assess their actual effectiveness. 4. The report is biased towards the report of the department's affairs and neglects the report of party affairs in various provinces. Therefore, it did not list party affairs in various provinces separately and added criticisms, so there was no way to review it. In the future, the status of party affairs in various provinces must be described one by one, and assessments and criticisms must be added. The provincial reports should be submitted to the next plenary session for review. (B) Regarding the Central Propaganda Department, 1. The country has made great efforts in the propaganda of party doctrines, political programs, policies, and domestic and foreign current affairs, and its effectiveness is quite considerable. However, in the past, it focused on the propaganda to cope with current affairs, and its power could not penetrate into the most outstanding intellectual elements of the country, nor could it be popularized to the majority of illiterate people. In the future, we must focus on deep and scientifically based propaganda on the one hand, and on various contact methods other than text on the other hand, so that party doctrines can be popularized to the people of the country. 2. The propaganda materials published in the past August have increased in knowledge and can assess the locations they have reached. This also shows that the propaganda work is universal and has made progress compared with the past. However, due to financial difficulties, directly printing and distributing propaganda materials is not a good way to popularize propaganda. In the future, we should supervise lower-level party headquarters, pay attention to indirect propaganda methods, so that social groups and individuals can automatically promote the doctrines, political programs, and policies implemented by our party from time to time and according to circumstances, so that they can gradually become universal and effective. 3. This work report book also has the shortcomings of focusing on department affairs and neglecting the propaganda work in various provinces. In the future, we must pay attention to correcting it and seek details. (C) Regarding the Central Training Department, 1. The work decided by the Central Training Department since the Second Plenary Session has been held in order. Among them, the test of party doctrines for the staff of various institutions has achieved remarkable results. In the future, it must continue to be carried out. 2. The organization and guidance of mass training are still making progress. At the same time, the organizational principles and management regulations for people's groups have also been formulated first. In the future, we must implement them to the best of our ability in accordance with the plans and methods for mass training and organization set by the Central Government, in order to seek the soundness and development of people's organizations. 3. This report is a report on department affairs, not a report on the training work of the entire party. This is a major shortcoming. In the future, we must pay attention to it and compile the training work of party headquarters at all levels in various provinces separately, add assessments and criticisms, and submit them to the next plenary session.</p>
<p>(12) The Party Affairs and Political Affairs Groups put forward opinions on reviewing the summary table of the progress of the resolutions on party affairs and political affairs at the Third Plenary Session and asked for a public decision. The resolution was: All party affairs resolutions of the Third Plenary Session have been completed by the competent ministries and commissions of the Central Party Headquarters. However, it is believed that the time is short, the jurisdiction is vast, and transportation is inconvenient. Party headquarters at all levels still have no reliable investigation or statistical report on the advantages and disadvantages of the promotion of various resolutions and their effectiveness. Therefore, it cannot be used as a reliable assessment. The competent ministries and commissions of the Central Party Headquarters are now responsible for supervising party headquarters at all levels on the various resolutions that have been promoted in the past, earnestly implement them, and report the general situation after implementation and its advantages, disadvantages, and effectiveness at any time. The deadline for reporting to the next plenary session for review is the next plenary session. Of the various political resolutions of the Third Plenary Session, some have started to be implemented but have not yet been completed, and some have not yet started to be implemented. The National Government should urge the competent authorities in charge of each item to earnestly take responsibility and implement them on schedule. Those who fail to implement them on schedule should explain the reasons and report them at any time.</p>
<p>(13) The Political Affairs Group proposed to review the opinions on the work reports of the National Government and its affiliated Yuan, ministries, and commissions and asked for a public decision. The resolution was: Many of the work reports of the National Government and its affiliated Yuan, ministries, and commissions did not grasp the essentials.

<h3 id="e42">New French Cabinet Announces Policy Direction <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Considerable Disturbance Among Left and Right Wing Members</p>
<p>Senate Passes Vote of Confidence in New Government</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 5th: Today, the new French cabinet attended Parliament for the first time and announced its political views. The uproar in the parliamentary arena reached its extreme. Despite the fact that various newspapers urged all parties to restrain political disputes due to the severe floods in the southern region, it had no effect. When the new cabinet members took their seats, the right-wing parties cheered and welcomed them, while the left-wing parties ridiculed them loudly. When Premier Tardieu, with a pleasant smile, ascended the stage to speak about the policy direction, after a few words, he provoked the anger of the left-wing parties by referring to the cabinet tide as a common occurrence in parliamentary life. Thereupon, the right-wing parties also rose to support Tardieu, responding with harsh words, lasting for more than ten minutes before the Speaker was able to restore order slightly, allowing Tardieu to continue his speech. At this time, Tardieu's face already showed discouragement, no longer as high-spirited as at the beginning. Later, although his speech slightly encroached on the left-wing parties, it was not as much as the newspapers had predicted. In general, he asked Parliament to pass the budget bill as soon as possible and to resolve all urgent diplomatic issues. He vigorously stated that the diplomatic policy should follow the old path. His description of financial problems occupied the majority of the speech, and he adopted the fiscal plan of the previous cabinet, Chautemps, intending to thoroughly reform the tax system to seek the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce. Finally, he also said that the country is currently facing many difficulties and is also at a time when the government is determined to allocate the preparation fund accumulated by the former Finance Minister, Cheron, to implement the economic plan, hoping that Parliament will wholeheartedly support it. After the speech, another loud uproar arose from the left-wing benches. Then, the Socialist member, Frossard, was the first to criticize the cabinet's political views, but the right-wing parties deliberately created a commotion, and his words could not be heard. The Speaker had no choice but to announce a recess of fifteen minutes. After the meeting resumed, the Speaker earnestly requested the members to maintain order. As soon as he finished speaking, Frossard stepped onto the stage, and the commotion resumed. The Speaker announced another recess and requested the right-wing members to maintain order as before. Thereupon, the right-wing members withdrew from the meeting place, and Frossard was able to express his opinion freely. Later, several members of the opposition party successively spoke, including the Radical Socialist Daladier, who also stated the reasons why his party did not support Tardieu. Then, Tardieu stood up again and claimed that at this critical moment of domestic and foreign affairs, it was a pity that the Radical Socialists had not agreed to a truce and cooperation with him, but that his policy direction was not much different from that of the opposition party.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 5th: The cabinet meeting has passed the government declaration, which states in brief that the government remains loyal to the policies of the previous Tardieu government. Domestic policy focuses on finance as the most important issue. First, it is necessary to maintain the budget balance and debt reduction fund policy, on which France has relied for security in the past four years. Second, it is necessary to stimulate the country's labor force at a time when world trends caused by overproduction have repercussions in France. What the government regrets is that the party truce has not yet been negotiated, but the government must fulfill its policies no matter what difficulties it encounters. The government has appointed representatives to attend the London Five-Power Naval Conference and has decided to ask Parliament to allocate 30 million francs to relieve the flood victims in southern France. A law on deferred payment of debts will be immediately promulgated in the disaster area. The Senate passed a vote of confidence in the new Tardieu government by a vote of 316 to 260.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Specialist Committee of London Conference Discusses Submarine Issue <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Japan-U.S. Negotiations Have Not Yet Reached Agreement</p>
<p>U.S. Chief Delegate Issues Article</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: The specialist committee for reviewing submarines met at St. James's Palace at 11:00 this morning to review the U.S. and French proposals attached to the Fourth General Meeting. The results of the review were: (1) The abolition of submarines is outside the scope of this committee and will not be discussed. (2) The prohibition of improper use will be discussed after appropriate committee members are determined. (3) The issue of ship types will be temporarily reserved. The review of the restriction issue did not allow the committee members to express their opinions, and the meeting was adjourned at noon. The next meeting is scheduled for 3:00 p.m. on the 6th.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: The four Japanese plenipotentiaries and advisors met at 3:00 p.m. on the 5th to hear Plenipotentiary Matsudaira report on his meeting with the British Prime Minister on the 4th and to coordinate the negotiations with the United States. After the meeting, Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki told the Reuters reporter that yesterday, I and Plenipotentiary Matsudaira met with the British Prime Minister twice to inform him of the content and process of the meeting between Plenipotentiary Matsudaira and Plenipotentiary Reijiro. This is because the Japan-U.S. negotiations are deeply related to the United Kingdom and are part of the three-country negotiations, so regardless of whether the opinions of the two are consistent or not, the United Kingdom must be informed, and since we have met with the British Prime Minister, the United Kingdom will naturally express its opinions. However, the extent to which a meeting of the three countries of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan is to be held has not yet been reached. As for the meeting with Stimson, although it has been said that we can meet at any time in the future, the date has not yet been decided. The reason why Matsudaira and Reijiro are continuing to meet is that the claims between Japan and the United States were initially far apart, and it is difficult to resolve the problem unless a way to moderate the situation is found at the appropriate point. Although I do not share the pessimistic view, I have no optimistic material. I urgently hope to achieve the goal as soon as possible, but I regret that I have not yet seen the dawn.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: The Naval Specialist Committee today discussed the abolition, humanization, and restriction of submarines. It was decided to shelve the abolition issue, as this is purely a matter of policy for the chief delegates. Naval experts have agreed in principle on the layer of regulations drafted by jurists for the humanization of submarines. The issue of limiting the tonnage of submarines has been postponed for consideration. It is heard that Japanese experts insist on a minimum limit of 2,000 tons, saying that the waves off the north coast of Japan are dangerous and lower submarines are useless.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: U.S. Chief Delegate Stimson issued an article today, mentioning the results that seem to be obtainable at the naval conference. It is said that the plan that seems to be acceptable to the United Kingdom and the United States in substance stipulates that the U.S. Navy will net reduce more than 200,000 tons of battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and submarines that have been built, are being built, or have been funded for construction, while the British Navy will reduce even more. As for the warships that have been approved by Congress but have not yet started construction, they have not been counted. If they are counted together, the number of tons reduced will be even more. Whether the United Kingdom and the United States will implement this reduction depends on how other navies reduce.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th: A female staff member specializing in typing in the London Naval Conference's British delegation fell out of a hotel window this morning and was immediately sent to the hospital with serious injuries.</p>

<p>The Garonne River is Still Rising</p>
<p>Five Southern Provinces Have Become a Large Lake</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 5th: The waters in southern France are vast, and the number of deaths has exceeded 300, a disaster unprecedented in a century. Today, five southern provinces have become a large lake, and the waters of the Garonne River are still rising without end. The losses are still impossible to estimate, but the first relief fund of 30 million francs decided by the government is like a drop in the bucket. It is heard that the new Premier has agreed to move in Parliament to continue issuing 100 million marks, but this number is still feared to be insufficient. Newspapers are promoting donations among the people to supplement the shortcomings of the public sector.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 6th: In the floods in southern France, it is now expected that at least 300 people have died and more than a thousand houses have been washed away. Many bodies are buried in the rubble. In Montauban alone, 150 people have died. Relief workers are using the aid of aircraft and are now working to rescue the team members surrounded by water.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Philippine Islands Student Unrest Escalates <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Student Parents Join Movement</p>
<p>Nineteen Arrested for Causing Trouble</p>
<p>Reuters, Manila, 5th: The intensity of the student unrest is unprecedented in the history of the Philippine Islands. The authorities are still unable to stop it. Today, the parents of 6,300 striking high school students are also echoing their children and the members of the City Council, resolving to appeal to Governor Davis and Senate Speaker Quezon to approve their demands. In addition to demanding the dismissal of the beautiful teacher, Miss Barromit, the students also demand the exemption of the acting Director of Public Instruction, Albert, and the Education Supervisor and Principal of a certain high school, Dr. Poe, and request that the four expelled students be allowed to return to school. The Governor and Quezon have not yet issued statements. Nineteen students have been arrested for causing trouble. Today, another student was stabbed, and another girl was kissed and hugged by male students in front of the school, and slapped in the face for trying to attend class. There was student harassment in front of West High School, causing a few students to be slightly injured. The authorities are still maintaining calm and trying to calm the youthful vigor. The beautiful teacher, Miss Barromit, has been dismissed and is about to pack up and return to the United States.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Manila, 6th: Around 10,000 high school students here still refuse to resume classes. Although rumors are rife that the strike has been incited by the Communist Party, in reality, it is not the case. The strike arose because the students were indeed motivated by patriotic enthusiasm. Philippine Senate President Quezon has not said a word about the matter. Acting Senate President Osmena stated that the Senate will never interfere in the matter. Acting Mayor Atienza today rejected the students' request to parade in groups and instructed the students to consult Island Chief Davis. The striking students are still peaceful, making only excited remarks when in groups of three or five. The root cause of the strike is that the students are demanding that the order to expel the four students be revoked and does not contain other intentions. Currently, a group of experienced and prudent people are inviting the parents of the students to discuss the ways to mediate and handle the situation.</p>

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 5th - Tomorrow is the International Struggle Day against Unemployment and Hunger. The authorities have ordered all police to be prepared to deal with disturbances. Communist newspapers carry announcements from the executive committees of the Communist Parties of Russia, Germany, and England, calling on all laborers to hold demonstrations.</p>
<p>Reuters, Stockholm, 5th - Anti-Soviet groups have invited the Archbishop to attend a meeting tomorrow to discuss the Soviet Union's anti-religious policies. This is a noteworthy event amidst the Communist demonstrations tomorrow. The police have approved outdoor meetings for laborers in three locations but have prohibited street parades and demonstrations.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 5th - French Prime Minister Tardieu has instructed the police to maintain local security on tomorrow's Communist demonstration day, to disallow street gatherings, and to revoke the driving licenses of any automobile drivers who strike.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 5th - Police are now on high alert to prevent incidents from occurring during the unemployment demonstration. It is expected that as many as 60,000 people will participate in the demonstration. Philadelphia police have approved public demonstrations and marches, but Chicago has not, as it is rumored that the demonstrators are carrying weapons and planning to attack the police. The Communist Party in St. Louis is now boasting that the city will never forget today's gathering.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Reval, 5th - Estonia rehearsed methods to prevent Communist riots, but unfortunately, a tragedy occurred. In order to test the effectiveness of preventive measures, the army authorities suddenly sounded an alarm. Immediately, sirens blared throughout the city. General Durwald, along with his adjutant, Major Imbruce, drove to the designated location. However, the garrison troops mistook it for a real alarm and, believing the two men to be Communists, opened fire with machine guns on the approaching vehicle. Major Imbruce was killed instantly, and General Durwald was seriously injured, with his life in danger.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 5th - Labour MP Ganley asked in the House of Commons tonight: Since the British government has diplomatic relations with the Chinese government and recognizes the Chinese Kuomintang, why is the Kuomintang banned in British Malaya? He also asked whether non-British residents in Malaya will be prevented from engaging in political activities related to their native political parties. Colonial Under-Secretary Hiles replied that the Kuomintang in Malaya has not been approved for registration and has not been recognized as a legal organization, but there is no need to actively prohibit it. The Colonial Secretary has telegraphed the Governor of the Straits Settlements to inquire about the reasons for the recent ban. Ganley stated that the 300,000 overseas Chinese in Malaya are a very valuable part of the local society. The Colonial Under-Secretary replied, "Indeed."</p>
<h3 id="e48">Japan Protests Indian Cotton Tax <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Considering it a violation of international morality.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 6th - The proposed increase in cotton cloth tariffs in India, given the current situation, is likely to pass the Indian parliament with an absolute majority. This has a significant impact on Japan and has caused great agitation among private operators and various sectors. Diplomatic authorities are investigating the truth. It is rumored to be a complete violation of treaties. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to lodge a serious protest with the British government and the Indian government. Foreign Minister Shidehara requested the understanding of all cabinet members at the cabinet meeting on the 4th, and the protest text may be sent out on the 5th or 6th. The main points of the text are two: (1) The cotton cloth tariff increase under consideration by the Indian parliament imposes a heavy tax of 4% on the British mainland and an additional 9% on Japan, which disregards the most-favored-nation clause granted to Japan and violates the Japan-India trade treaty. The Indian government should abide by the treaty provisions and apply the lowest tax rate to Japan. (2) Japan imports one-third of India's cotton each year for consumption, so the relationship between cotton yarn and cloth between Japan and India is very close. Now, the Indian government suddenly adopts such an attitude towards Japan, disregarding international morality to the extreme. It is believed that the Indian government will quickly withdraw this proposal.</p>

<p>Rioters Demonstrate Outside Parliament</p>
<p>Reuters, Cape Town, 5th - South African Minister of Justice Piro believes that the spread of Red propaganda among the local Africans in Africa is intensifying, and strict measures are necessary to curb the chaos. Therefore, he proposed a Riotous Assemblies Act in parliament. The local Africans strongly opposed this and gathered to demonstrate outside the parliament today, leading to clashes with the police, with several people injured on both sides. The local Africans initially wanted to rely on their numbers to force their way into parliament to meet with the Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice. Later, they threw glass bottles, stones, wood, and other objects, but were eventually dispersed by the police.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Britain Sets Naval Budget <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th - The naval budget is now set at £51,739,000, saving £40 million compared to 1929. According to Navy Secretary Alexander, the savings are mostly due to the reduction in the 1928-29 shipbuilding program. Otherwise, not only would there be no savings, but an additional £10 million would be required. The government has decided not to draft any shipbuilding proposals until the results of the naval conference are determined. As for naval personnel, they will be reduced to 97,050 in 1930 and 94,000 in 1931, compared to 99,800 last year. Although there are no new expenses for the Singapore naval base, £220,000 more than the amount decided in 1929 will be required because delaying the projects stipulated in the contract is uneconomical.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Telegram <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>From He Chengjun, Hankou, to all newspapers: I recently replied to Commander-in-Chief Zhang in a telegram, saying: "I have received Dongri's telegram, which is clear in its reasoning and sincere in its intention, reading it again and again, bringing tears to my eyes. I believe that there is no lack of methods to serve the country, but it is essential to be sincere. There is no lack of ways to stop the chaos, but it is essential to understand each other. At this time, survival depends on ending the conflict, as your opinion states. However, since General Bai's telegram was sent, although the arguments have been heated and considered shocking, the central government still focuses on appeasement and sincerity, repeatedly and gently persuading. If General Bai can consider the Party and the country and cherish the national cause, he should wake up immediately, cover up his past mistakes, and untie the knot, which will not harm him in the slightest. However, according to reports, for the past ten days, General Bai's side has been gathering various reactionaries in Xuzhou, daily discussing ideas that are far from reality, unthinkable, and must destroy the overall situation. On the other hand, he has appointed a large number of commanders, attacking Pinghan in segments. Even the five-route troops under my command have been incorporated into the battle sequence without authorization. In terms of courtesy, they secretly mobilize; in terms of stopping the chaos, they first plot rebellion. The debate on small matters should be limited to the benefit of the Party and the country. If seeking to provoke, it is certainly intended to destroy the overall situation and will be abandoned by the people of the country. I have worked with General Bai for a long time and know him well. He has always been prudent and would not do this. But the reason for this is that he is surrounded by all kinds of reactionaries without realizing it. Every time I think about it, I am deeply saddened. Fortunately, Your Excellency advocates justice and maintains peace. The benevolent are admired by all. However, peace must be achieved through proper means. If General Bai can expel the evil elements and meet sincerely, all requests, as long as they do not conflict with Party discipline and national law, the central government can be generous and seek completeness. Judging from past facts, how has the central government treated General Bai, and how has General Bai treated the central government? You also know this well. At this critical juncture, I want to speak out for justice and promote General Bai's reflection, and I can only rely on you. I humbly submit my views and hope to hear your enlightened teachings." Respectfully submitted, He Chengjun.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e53">Chen Tiaoyuan Reports the Truth About the Current Situation <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The overall situation has eased.</p>
<p>Han Shi will issue a telegram to attack Yan.</p>
<p>Yan's best policy is to step down.</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: At 9 a.m. this morning, the provincial government held the Prime Minister's Memorial Week, and the meeting was held as scheduled. Provincial Government Chairman Chen Tiaoyuan reported: (A) Central Party Affairs: (1) The Third Plenary Session was held on the 1st, with more than 40 members present, exceeding the majority. Important issues will be resolved at this meeting. (2) The 76th Standing Committee decided to increase the punishment for Party members who commit crimes by two-thirds. (B) The Central Political Construction Committee has closed its session and passed 56 proposals. Director Chen (Luanshu) has arrived in Shanghai from Beijing and will return to Jinan today. (C) International Affairs: The London Naval Conference was suspended due to the change of the French cabinet. The current independence movement in India is extremely fierce, and the British are paying great attention to it. (D) Political Situation in the Province: (1) To commemorate the passing of the Prime Minister, the Civil and Agricultural Departments are preparing to expand the afforestation movement. (2) The Yellow River ice flood has not passed, and the spring flood is coming again. The River Affairs Bureau has been ordered to actively defend and rush to build the Liu Zhuang stone dam. The Yellow River is unlikely to have accidents in the next 19 years. (E) Overall Situation: There has been a good turn in the overall situation this morning. Han Shi's peace telegram is an expression of supporting the central government and opposing Yan Xishan and the joint telegram of more than 40 people. After Han Shi's telegram, Shi's troops retreated west to Guide, and Han's troops retreated west to Zhengzhou. The situation has greatly eased because Han Shi also knows that there is no other way but to support the central government. As for the Northwest Army, the central government has agreed to grant 2 million yuan per month, and the army has decided on the direction of the attack. The main force now opposing the central government is the Yan Xishan troops. Yan has been exploiting others for the past eighteen years since the Xinhai Revolution. This time, he was forced to sacrifice himself and advance his troops to western and northern Shandong, which is Yan's expression of his determination to fight to the miscellaneous army. But the good archer will die from the arrow, and the good rider will die from the horse. Even if you treat people with sincerity, they may not believe you. If you treat people with deceit, you will never fail. Yuan Shikai is a lesson from Yan's past. In addition to Han Shi, Sun Dianying has telegraphed the central government to plead guilty, and all parties have denied Yan's impersonated telegram. What is particularly important is that Zhang Xueliang's advocacy of a peaceful telegram is inclined to the central government. However, because Zhang has a different position in the Northeast, he ranks the central government alongside Yan, which is his mistake. Although Yan's troops have arrived in Caozhou, a regiment, Lianzhen's three brigades, and a unit in Dezhou, they are really incapable. Because Han Shi's steps have been set, the second step is to issue a telegram to attack Yan, and the third step is to disband the troops in Henan and Shanxi. The central government telegraphed Yan to persuade him to pull back from the brink and cancel his resignation and ominous actions. Yan replied that he has not reached the brink and cannot be pulled back, and there are no ominous actions, and resignation cannot be cancelled. We see that Yan's best policy at this moment is to step down, and the next best is to withdraw his troops back to Shanxi, or he may be able to survive for a while. Otherwise, the situation will become isolated, which is no longer a problem. In short, 70 to 80 percent of the overall situation has turned around. (March 3rd)</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the Jin army launched, Shandong has borne the brunt. Commander-in-Chief Jiang has repeatedly ordered the Shandong army to remain calm and not to start a war lightly. Therefore, Chen Tiaoyuan transferred the 2nd Security Brigade of Chen Xiaosi, stationed in Dezhou, to southern Shandong. The Jin army's plainclothes team entered Dezhou at 3 p.m. on March 1. Most of the Shandong army is now in the Yucheng and Pingyuan areas. Heavy troops have been deployed on both the north and south banks of the Yellow River in Shandong. In western Shandong, the 42nd Infantry Division of Feng Pengzhu and the 21st Cavalry Division of the Jin army are successively developing towards Caozhou. As for the remnants of Gao Guizi, after fleeing from Yixian, Linyi, and Anqiu to Zhucheng, the 26th Division of the Central Army and the 46th and 55th Divisions of Shandong are attacking from all sides and will be resolved within days. (March 3rd)</p>

<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The issue of the current situation is gradually being revealed. Since Yan Xishan sent a series of telegrams, the atmosphere in Taiyuan has changed. Regarding military affairs, in addition to the part of Yang Xiaoou stationed in Linfen, which was ordered to go north and stationed in Pinding, yesterday the entire 6th Artillery Regiment stationed in the province was transferred to Tianjin. In terms of transportation, the first supply station started to go to Shijiazhuang the day before yesterday and started preparations. There are no other movements. A large batch of bullets has also been transported out in recent days. Yan and Kong Geng personally visited Feng at Jian'an the day before yesterday afternoon. Feng agreed to come to Taiyuan that day, so the official sent two liaison adjutants to prepare a temporary residence for Feng at Chuan Gong Temple. All the supplies were newly purchased, and the arrangements were extremely luxurious. Famous chefs were also hired to prepare food. Feng then came to Taiyuan with his family yesterday and lived there. The joint headquarters of the General and Deputy Commanders, jointly organized by Yan and others, has been roughly completed and started working. (March 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e56">Liu Zhi Urges Han Shi to Obey the Central Government <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>▲The Second Route Headquarters issued a telegram to persuade Han Shi</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The situation between Xuzhou and Henan has always been eased, and the recent atmosphere is even better. The reason is that Han Fuqu has repeatedly sent letters and telegrams to Liu Zhi and sent representatives Tang Xiang and He Qishen to contact him, expressing obedience to the central government. Shi Yousan also telegraphed Liu to express his obedience to the central government and act in accordance with Han Shi. Liu Zhi then sent telegrams to Han Shi, pointing out the great righteousness and urging him to wake up. Therefore, the situation on both sides is improving day by day. Now, the headquarters has sent Chief of Staff Jiang Bocheng, Transportation Commander Qian Zongze, and Chief of Staff of the Third Route Army Li Shuchun to Bian on the evening of the 1st to contact. Han also sent Ordnance Director Zhang Degong from Bian to Beijing on the 3rd to purchase military materials. There is also good news that passenger cars in Xuzhou and Bian have resumed operation. The following is the original record of the four telegrams that the Second Route Headquarters publicly released from Liu Zhi to Han Shi. The development of the situation between Xuzhou and Henan can be seen in these four telegrams.</p>
<p>▲Hao Telegram: Urgent, Chairman Han Xiangfang of Kaifeng, Commander-in-Chief Shi Hanzhang of Guide, I have not seen each other for a long time, and I always miss you very much. The Party and the country have many troubles, and wars are frequent. The people's livelihood is almost exhausted. Recently, more rumors have been spread, and everyone is frightened. The people are worried and cannot live in peace. We soldiers cannot fulfill our duty to save the country and protect the people. Now that the people are so haggard, we are very sad. After detailed investigation, the reason is that ambitious warlords use their personal power and secretly carry out divisive tactics. Only by sincerely supporting the central government, obeying the government, promoting unity, and realizing peace can the people be relieved of their suffering and the country can be free from the danger of collapse. If you are used by others, indulge in anger for a while, harm your own personality, forget the long history, and eventually become the public enemy of the country and be secretly happy by good people. Both of you are strong in the Party and the country, have long enjoyed a reputation, and have a broad vision and insight into the advantages and disadvantages. I hope you can see through the traitorous plots, obey the central government, join hands, and jointly revolutionize. It is not only the fortune of the Party and the country but also the blessing of the region. Being at the end of love, I dare to speak frankly. I hope you will understand and pray for it. I am now in Xuzhou, close to the barracks, and I hope to be taught from time to time, and I am even more grateful. Your brother, Liu Zhi, bows down.</p>
<p>▲Yang Telegram: Urgent, Chairman Han Xiangfang of Kaifeng, I have respectfully read your telegram. I admire your maintenance of peace. As for the change of county magistrates in southern Henan, it was because during the campaign against Tang, most of the county magistrates were appointed by Tang and helped the rebels, so I presented it to the President for approval and replaced them. Now that the war has ended, I have moved to Xuzhou and have not asked about it for a long time. This is a reply. Your brother, Liu Zhi, bows down.</p>
<p>▲Jing Telegram: Urgent, Commander-in-Chief Han Xiangfang of Kaifeng, and please translate to Commander-in-Chief Shi Hanzhang. Secret, I have received Commander Hanzhang's telegram and admired his high-mindedness in protecting peace. Chief of Staff Li passed through Xuzhou last night and learned all of your intentions. Supporting the central government, loyalty and sincerity are gratifying. From now on, we generals will join hands, promote peace, and not only will the people's suffering be relieved, but the foundation of the Party and the country will also be consolidated. Great achievements, the whole country admires. Zhi and you have devoted themselves to the revolution and shared difficulties for a long time. Now, when the Party and the country are in trouble, we need each other even more. I hope to work together, be sincere with each other, be consistent from beginning to end, work together, and complete the revolutionary cause and achieve the success of unity. My humble opinion, I cannot express my thick hope. I hope you will understand. Your brother, Liu Zhi, bows down.</p>
<p>▲Dong Telegram: Urgent, Chairman Han Xiangfang of Kaifeng, Secret, Director Hai passed through Xuzhou and forwarded your letter and described all your intentions. I have listened respectfully to everything. Today, I reread your and Hanzhang's joint telegram, and I see your sincerity in maintaining peace and supporting unity. I am even more admired. Now, rumors are intensifying, and the whole country is panic-stricken. If you want to quell the chaos, the responsibility lies with us. Since you and Commander Hanzhang have vowed loyalty to the central government and your determination is as firm as gold and stone, I hope you will quickly make further proposals and express your opposition to Yan. Then, the prestige will spread and intimidate the rebels. It will be easy to eliminate the rebel party. Please convey this to Commander Hanzhang. The personnel appointed in southern Henan have been registered and will be sent to you for consideration of retention or removal. I will report to you first. Your brother, Liu Zhi, bows down.</p>
<p>It is also reported that Jiang Bocheng and Qian Zongze, who were sent by the central government to Kaifeng for contact, returned to Beijing yesterday (4th) morning with Han's representative Li Shuchun and Shi's representative Qin Jianbin. When they passed through Xuzhou, they carried Han's and Shi's letters to Liu Zhi. At that time, Gu Zhutong arrived at the station and met with Jiang, Qian, Li, Qin, and others, and talked for more than ten minutes. After Liu Zhi received the letter, he sent Liu Yaoyang, Chief of Staff of the Second Route Headquarters, to Bian that evening to contact Han Shi on everything. According to the news from the headquarters, the contents of Han's and Shi's letters sincerely expressed their attitude of supporting the central government and described the difficult situation. Liu Zhi sent a telegram to Han Shi, asking him to make further expressions and quickly oppose Yan. Liu's trip also has the task of this contact. As for the Jinpu vehicles detained by Shi's troops, after the Ministry of Railways sent Xia Dazhang to contact Jiang, Qian, and others, they can be returned. At the moment, the representatives are traveling back and forth, and special cars are running smoothly without hindrance. The railway news said that the Jin army, the Feng Pengzhu unit in western Shandong, has automatically stopped advancing and is in a state of retreat. (5th)</p>
<h3 id="e57">White Russians in Sanhe Town with Black Borders are Planning Trouble <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>▲Organize troops into two parts</p>
<p>▲Actually want to seize Hulunbuir</p>
<p>▲Black Army's All-Victorious Regiment Rushes to Suppress</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence, 25th - In Hulunbuir Mongolian Banner, 300 miles northeast of Hailar, there is a small town called Sanhe, which used to be an uncultivated area between Shiwei and Lubin counties. In the past, it was barren and uninhabited. After the Russian Revolution and the Red Party came to power, a general group of White Russian descendants fled into our territory and gathered in Sanhe. They have reproduced to this day, with about 300 families and more than 4,000 people. Heilongjiang province is vast, rich in resources, and has lenient policies, so no one has asked about this group or paid attention to their actions. Gradually, an area of hundreds of miles around has become a White Russian settlement. These people usually maintain their lives by raising livestock and farming. They are still in harmony with our Chinese merchants, and the authorities have sympathized with their surviving from a lost country and treated them with special tolerance as fellow countrymen. Last year, during the Russian rebellion, the Red Russians invaded and burned and slaughtered Sanhe. Afterwards, the White Russians petitioned our authorities for permission to purchase firearms for self-defense. When the Manchurian Sea fell and the defeated soldiers and brave men returned from the front line and passed through the area, they were attacked by these people. People were massacred and bullets were confiscated. Merchants passing through the area to escape were also killed. The total number of Chinese military and civilians killed was no less than several hundred. The party used the weapons obtained to organize the army. The leaders are (Shute Laofu) and (Bate Yefu). They are divided into two teams, each with about 250 people, and are actually preparing for a major operation. A few days ago, they even planned to rob a westbound passenger car and harass the Yakeshi station, peeping at Hailar. Zhao Zhongren, the Hulunbuir commissioner, sent a special commissioner to appease them, but the envoy was killed. The authorities were extremely angry. In addition to urgently telegraphing Liang Zhongjia, the Hailar garrison commander, to send troops to assist in the suppression, they also ordered the entire All-Victorious Regiment of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade to rush to search and suppress on the 24th. On the 25th, the Tu regiment arrived in Yakeshi and transported it to Sanhe by train. The area is more than 100 miles away from Sanhe, and it can be reached in one day and one night. It is expected that heavy troops will attack, and it will not be difficult to pacify it soon.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Resolutions of the Third Plenary Session <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>▲ Proposal on Transferring Disbanded Armed Comrades: Resolution of the Disbandment Conference. Although constrained by feudal thinking,</p>
<p>the greatest aspiration of the people and the most important national construction policy that our party adheres to, following the teachings of the Premier, must be implemented without hesitation. Repeated military actions in recent years to suppress reactionary warlords were also aimed at the early completion of disbandment. Now that the reactionary warlords who hold onto troops for self-defense are gradually being eliminated, all resolutions of the Disbandment Conference can be implemented without difficulty. During the implementation, retired officers and soldiers all have revolutionary histories and should be transferred to all construction undertakings to complete the national revolution. Based on this principle, the specific measures for transferring the work of comrades after disbandment are proposed as follows: (1) Establish large-scale police academies, select healthy and somewhat knowledgeable retired officers, enroll them for one or two years of study, and assign them to serve in various provinces and counties after graduation. (2) Establish gendarmerie training institutions, select retired officers with surveying schools, select retired officers with relatively more knowledge, enroll them for one year, and assign them as assistant land surveyors or road surveyors after graduation. (4) Establish civil engineering personnel training institutes, select retired officers with relatively more knowledge, enroll them, and impart the necessary skills and knowledge for civil engineering, for one year. After graduation, assign them to railway engineering agencies, road engineering agencies, or water conservancy engineering agencies as supervisors and engineers, etc. (5) Each army should take turns hiring teachers with rich agricultural or engineering experience to teach the necessary skills in agriculture or engineering. (6) The government may select retired military officers from farming</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>villages who have slightly poorer academic qualifications but rich experience as commissioners of reclamation areas, assisted by foreign agricultural experts, to engage in reclamation projects, based on industrial plans. (7) Organize Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest border inspection groups.</p>
<p>Proposal on Supporting Comrades and Increasing Construction Efficiency</p>
<p>Our party has come to this day with a long history and relying on the long-term struggle of comrades. Among them, those who sacrificed their lives and became disabled for the party already have regulations for commendation and compensation to rely on, so that the elderly are cared for and the young are nurtured. However, those who have ruined their families, dropped out of school, and become destitute due to their efforts in the revolution are still often overlooked, although they are always in the central government's thoughts. Not only that, but all comrades who have worked hard for the party for a long time, regardless of their age, experience, or knowledge, all possess a revolutionary spirit and a deep belief in the doctrine. At this time when political tutelage has begun and everything is waiting to be managed, all our comrades should do their best to devote themselves to all effective paths, lead the masses, and complete political tutelage. Based on this principle, the Party should, on the one hand, encourage comrades to acquire the skills to support themselves and produce for the country, and on the other hand, it should provide all appropriate opportunities. Some comrades forget their ability to automatically contribute to society and the country and want to rely on the party, making the party exhaust itself in responding to individual requests. This is a major mistake. If the central government sits idly by and watches these countless talented people decline day by day, it would be a great pity. The specific measures for supporting comrades and increasing construction efficiency are proposed as follows: (1) Young comrades who have worked hard in revolutionary work should, from now on, shift from destruction to striving to engage in a practical construction work. In order to develop their will and ability, the central government should pay attention to each person's strengths and give them appropriate opportunities, such as the following: 1. Run education businesses or take on education roles after passing examinations. 2. Go to various places to conduct social and economic surveys. 3. Study and inspect the development of education, politics, and industry in border provinces. 4. Serve as county magistrates or local administrative assistants after passing examinations to prepare for local autonomy. 5. Serve as consuls and embassy staff after passing examinations. (2) If young comrades' abilities are not sufficient to meet the needs of their work, the central government should find ways to train and cultivate them to become useful talents for construction. (3) Encourage writing and translation related to party doctrine and party governance, so that young comrades can all strive to learn. The central government will also set up a special compilation and translation office to recruit such talents, guide their work, and review their achievements. (4) Veteran comrades who have participated in the revolution and have made achievements but currently do not have suitable work, the central government should find ways to recruit them to engage in the following types of work: 1. Compile party history. 2. Compile national history. 3. Inspect administration. 4. Supervise land reclamation. 5. Give speeches on party history. 6. Compile local gazetteers. 7. Send them abroad for inspection. (5) For veteran comrades who have contributed to the revolution but are old and frail and unable to work, the central government should provide them with old-age pensions to reward their merits and instruct them to pay attention to promoting local social undertakings and report their progress to the central government every year.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Negotiations on Foreigners Acquiring Property in Zhejiang Province <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Case of British National Mei Tenggen's Property</p>
<p>When the National Revolutionary Army entered Zhejiang, the local people, because the British doctor Mei Tenggen, under the guise of running the Guangji Hospital Medical School with enthusiasm for charity, had engaged in aggression for many years, accumulated resentment for many years. Provincial government sent officials to take over, and a hospital affairs committee was set up to manage the matter. Private property was handled by a liquidation committee. Later, Tan Xin, the dean of the Guangji Hospital run by Mei Tenggen, repeatedly requested the provincial government to return the Guangji Medical School through the British consul stationed in Ningbo. The Zhejiang University and the Department of Civil Affairs jointly submitted the request to the provincial government committee for decision, which approved the return of the hospital and the medical school. The private property was temporarily managed by the Department of Civil Affairs after the hospital affairs committee and others were closed. Unexpectedly, the missionary Gong Duoma moved into the houses on Ma Shi Street on his own, and Tan Xin also continued to request the return of the houses at Ziyun Cave in West Lake, the cemetery at Jiulimatsu on Lingyin Road, and the houses at Zhi Dafangbo. Finally, the British consul sent a letter requesting the return of all of Mei Tenggen's private property in Hangzhou and Moganshan. Mei Tenggen and others first found ways to return the hospital and the medical school, and then requested the return of private property. The steps of foreign negotiations are truly amazing. This time, the provincial government, in addition to notifying the Ma Shi Street houses and instructing them to submit title deeds, household registers, grain certificates, and other documents for review, the Ziyun Cave houses have scenic relations, the Jiulimatsu cemetery is a missionary cemetery purchased in the name of a private individual, and is in contact with the Anglican Church. The ownership of the Zhi Dafangbo houses is still under investigation. Besides informing the department to submit proof, all of Mei Tenggen's private property in Hangzhou and Moganshan has been repeatedly requested by the British consul, and because the inside story is complicated, it is necessary to investigate in detail and handle it properly. In the middle of last month, the Department of Civil Affairs was ordered to investigate and report in detail. It is now heard that the department has followed the order and submitted the report on the liquidation committee's investigation of private property and the recent detailed investigation. After reviewing the report, Zhang Jingjiang, Chairman of the Provincial Government, stated that although the British consul used the Sino-Japanese Treaty as a basis, saying that Mei Tenggen had property rights, the Sino-Japanese Treaty stipulates that the scope of foreign residence is northeast of Gongchen Bridge, with designated boundaries and charter regulations. Foreigners are not allowed to freely acquire property in other places. It is still planned to reject the British consul's request for the return of all private property outside the concession based on the treaty and the violations of regulations in Mei's property acquisition. This case could have been decided at the previous provincial government meeting according to the case handling procedure, but because Chairman Zhang went to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session, it has not yet been reviewed. It is heard that as soon as Zhang and Zhu Jiahua, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, return to Zhejiang, the reply letter can be issued after it is passed at the meeting.</p>

<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Water police arrest bandits and escort them to Songjiang. The first district of the Minhang Water Police Provincial Public Security Team reported that Li Huchen, the third team leader, had arrested bandits Liu Xiaomei and others in Shanghai. After interrogation, they confessed that they had repeatedly committed robbery and kidnapping for ransom in various townships in Songjiang Punan, such as the Cai surname case in Sha Jiutu and the cotton boat robbery of Fang Zhengming in Shanyang. There are still several kidnapping cases. After the district chief learned of the confession, he immediately dispatched Zhang Tiange, an inspector of the headquarters, to lead four patrolmen to escort Liu Xiaomei, Wang Shaodi, Li Shan, and Jin Ada, a suspect in another case, to the county government of this county for trial on the 6th. After hearing the case, Auditor Du ordered them to be imprisoned pending investigation.</p>
<p>Arrest of a suspect in embezzling rice funds. Meng Qiuting, a partner of Yao Hengyuan Rice Store in Xitan, this city, embezzled more than 1,000 yuan of rice funds that the store should have received from various stores in Shanghai last year when he was selling goods in Shanghai. He avoided returning to the store. The store sent people to investigate but failed to find him. The store filed a lawsuit with the county government, and the suspect was arrested and sent to the government for trial on the 6th.</p>

Wang and others applied for bail and were approved. Wang, Hua, and others posted bail yesterday (6th) and were released.</p>
<p>Water police encircle and suppress gangsters in Pudong. Since the towns of Wei Jing Tang and Wu Shen Jing in the county were robbed by gangsters from Pudong on the 21st of last month, the gangsters have all fled to Dianshan Lake. The third district of the Water Public Security ordered the 11th, 14th, and 15th teams to go to suppress them. Unexpectedly, the steamer from Shanghai to Huzhou was robbed by the gang leader Taibao A Xu and his gang at Zuo Cang, and many people were shot and injured. After the bandits robbed the property, they fled to Dianshan Lake again. Gong, the district chief of the third district, in addition to telegraphing Chi, the district chief of the first district of Minhang, to send a team to intercept them, also telegraphed the team leaders of the 11th, 14th, and 15th teams to go and join the team boats in the first district to seize the opportunity to suppress them.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Tragic robbery in Changda Mansion. At about 10 o'clock the night before last, more than ten bandits suddenly came to the home of Shen Xiaodi, a villager from Xia'an, Wujitu, Changda Mansion, under the jurisdiction of the county. They spoke in a northern accent and carried weapons such as pistols, sharp knives, and iron bars. They broke into the house. At that time, the Shen family, young and old, had already fallen asleep. After the bandits entered the house, they took Xiaodi from the bed and forced him to tell them where the silver was hidden. Xiaodi refused. The bandits took off Xiaodi's clothes, tied him with a rope, hung him in the kitchen, beat him with a hoe, and slashed his legs with a sharp knife. Blood flowed like a river, but Xiaodi still did not speak. The bandits then used burning firewood to iron Xiaodi's body, causing his flesh to be blurred and unbearable to look at. Xiaodi's second son, Longbao, seeing this, stepped forward to beg for mercy and was also seized by the bandits, stripped of his clothes, hung up, and beaten, leaving him covered in wounds. The bandits then searched and robbed separately. After two hours, they took the stolen goods and fled. After the incident, it was checked and found that they had been robbed of 30 yuan in cash, two gold rings, and clothing, totaling more than 180 yuan in losses. The Shen family and his son were seriously injured and came to the city yesterday to report to the county and ask for the arrest of the bandits and the recovery of the stolen goods.</p>
<p>Changing the auditor for a confirmed trial. Dong, the auditor of this county, was ordered to be transferred to the Nantong County Court Preparatory Committee. The vacancy was filled by Yang, the auditor of Wujiang County, transferred by the High Court. Since Yang was entrusted with an important case by the Department of Civil Affairs, he could not come to Xicheng. President Lin then changed the order and transferred Yu Jitang, the auditor of Kunshan County, to Xicheng to act as an agent. It is heard that Yu will arrive in the county to take office soon. It is also heard that Lu Ying, the auditor of Wujin County, has been transferred to fill the vacancy in Kunshan.</p>
<p>The commissioner of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce came to Xicheng to investigate. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government, in accordance with the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session, sent officials to investigate the domestic labor situation and industrial production in districts to improve them. Yesterday, Kong, the minister, appointed Zhu Shikang, a member of the Regulations Committee and director of the Arbitration Section, Chen Bingyao, the director of the Statistics Section, and Tang Qixian and other investigators, a total of twelve people, together with Lin Jizhi, the director of the Labor Hygiene Section of the Ministry of Health, departed from Beijing to investigate Wuyi first.

It is heard that the task of Lin, the director of the Department of Health, is to focus on the hygiene of factory women and child laborers, such as their living, diet, etc., and to prepare to establish a model industrial hygiene zone, designating factories to conduct various labor hygiene matters on a trial basis.</p>
<p>Jiangyin</p>
<p>The central government comforts Li and Zhu, two party members. Qingyang, Li Zhongdan, Zhu Zhaotong and others have made considerable efforts in party affairs. In the past year, in order to prepare for the security regiment, they went to Shanghai to purchase weapons and were assassinated by bandits. The executive committee of the former county party department submitted the report to the province and then to the central government. According to the regulations for comforting party members, each was given a one-time comfort payment of 500 yuan of the third class, which was issued by the provincial government.</p>
<p>Director Lin of the Education Bureau transferred to the province. Lin Yanming, the director of the Education Bureau, took over the matter on October 17 of last year and has been in office for four months. Due to the tide of education, he was ordered to transfer to the province. The order arrived on the 3rd and ordered County Chief Shen to select someone to temporarily replace him and report three people for review and appointment in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>Huangtiangang urgently needs to be dredged. Huangtiangang, outside the north, has not been dredged for many years and is gradually silted up. Previously, there were 301 representatives of 20 industries who submitted a report to the Chamber of Commerce and transferred it to the county for review and dredging. The order stated that it seems feasible to draw boat donations to cover the expenses of dredging Huangtiangang, similar to the method of Taixing County. The Construction Bureau should be ordered to review and respond before submitting it for review and instruction.</p>
<p>The Construction Bureau has no right to change the Chengxi route. The south of the Chengxi Highway has been completed, and the north section has been delayed due to office relations. Previously, Xue Chan and others from Sihe Township believed that the Chengxi Road could save bridges, save public funds, and cultivate wasteland into good fields if it went straight south from Dushan Bridge to the west. Director Li of the Construction Bureau believes that the road line has already been detailed and reported to the Construction Department for review and instruction. There is no such right to change the route. The county is requested to transfer the report to the Construction Department for review and instruction.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>Expediting land registration. The Department of Finance of Jiangsu Province has previously issued a notice to all counties to handle land registration.

The department believes that the land registration is of great importance and the deadline is only six months. The department telegraphed all counties yesterday to hold it on a specific date and report it immediately.</p>
<p>Delineating afforestation areas. The Provincial Afforestation Movement Committee stipulates that tree planting will be carried out on Beigu Mountain from the 6th to the 11th of this month.

More than a dozen chiefs, including He Guangyin, have been arrested and sent to the same general headquarters for trial.</p>
<p>Various sectors held a meeting to protect the Jiang'an embankment. The Jiang'an embankment in the southwest of Tongyi has been collapsing severely recently. The County Government Construction Bureau convened representatives from all sectors on the 5th to hold a meeting to protect the embankment. The meeting decided (1) that all fields within 600 feet of the riverbank in Yao Ge Port would be subject to a small embankment protection donation area and a small amount of work to expand the embankment; (2) to raise funds to purchase four tons of stones to build the embankment; (3) in addition to raising funds locally, the Construction Bureau would send a letter to various shipping companies to subsidize 4,000 yuan; (4) that the embankment was in danger and could not wait. Borrow money from the Finance Bureau first and start work on the 10th.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>County Executive Committee selected. The term of office of the executive committee of the Jiaxing County Party Department has expired. Chen Naihe and other 22 people were selected at the Fourth County Congress and submitted for review and selection. It is learned that after the Provincial Executive Committee received the report, it decided at yesterday's regular meeting to select Shen Mingcai, Zhou Mingsheng, Zhu Zhenfan, Lu Chujue, and Wang Cheng as executive members, and Qian Weicheng, Cao Xianzhang, and Wu Xiangshi as alternate executive members.</p>
<p>Appointed commissioners to report on land and assist staff. Most of the land reports handled by village and neighborhood associations in Jiaxing have been completed and are being mapped and compiled into a general register. Therefore, the county government revoked all stationed district instructors on March 1 and appointed Pan Husheng and Shen Fusheng and other five people as supervisors to supervise the land reporting matters in districts. It is now learned that in order to quickly complete this task, the Department of Civil Affairs of the province ordered Ruan Dihua and other six people to come to the county to assist in the land reporting matters. The county assigned each member to go to various districts to provide assistance on the ground.</p>
<p>The Nanhuan Zhuang robbery case was solved. Wang Zuocai's family in Nanhuan Zhuang, Xupoqiao Township, Jiaxing, was robbed by bandits and injured. It is now learned that the bandits in this case have been arrested by the water police, including Zhu Jinde and Zhang A Jin and others, and the stolen goods and evidence have been recovered. The water police district sent them to the court for trial. It was learned from the trial that the landlady and neighbor of the victim, Blind Aunt San, was the mother-in-law of the bandit Zhu Jinde and had the suspicion of instigating the case. Therefore, the blind woman has been detained for investigation.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Scheduled meeting for construction loans. The Finance and Construction Departments of Zhejiang Province need 2.4 million yuan for construction in the next four months, starting this month, but the construction bonds have not yet been issued. Therefore, they borrowed from the banking industry. However, the amount of the loan was too large and it was difficult to raise. They could only barely raise 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Therefore, the Finance and Construction Departments decided to convene representatives from the chambers of commerce and the banking industry in the five counties of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Ningbo, and Shaoxing in Hangzhou on the 10th to discuss the loan method. The construction bonds will still be used as collateral. It is also heard that because the original number of members of the Construction Bond Fund Management Committee was too small, it is planned to add three to five more members.</p>
<p>Solving the problem of the management of public funds and assets. The Department of Civil Affairs of Zhejiang Province submitted a proposal to the provincial government for decision. The original public fund and asset committees in various counties had many names and different organizations. They were all cancelled and new regulations were drafted by the department. After careful organization, the Department of Finance was immediately requested to send personnel to discuss and determine the principles. However, the detailed measures have not yet been decided. The Department of Finance sent a letter to the Department of Civil Affairs yesterday, requesting the department to take charge of drafting them. The second review meeting will be held on a scheduled date. It is said that this case will be resolved soon.</p>
<p>The opening of the Hangping Highway has been rescheduled. The Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau announced that the Hangping Road has been completed and was originally scheduled to open on the 23rd. Now it has been advanced and will be held on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>Ningbo</p>
<p>Mayor Yang takes office. Yang Ziyi, the new mayor of Ningbo, held a swearing-in ceremony at the National Goods Exhibition Hall at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. More than 500 guests arrived and the ceremony was held as scheduled.</p>
<p>The municipal government continues to appoint important officials. The Yong municipal government appointed Chen Shaonan as the secretary-general, Chen Xuan as the director of the Social Affairs Section, Chen Bangji as the director of the Secretariat Section, and Jin Tiixuan as the director of the Health Section.</p>
<p>Change of commander of the fortress. Wang Zuiying, commander of the Zhenhai Fortress, was ordered to be transferred to the capital fortress commander. The vacancy has been filled by Sun Xinghuan. The personnel of the headquarters are currently transferring the matter.</p>
<p>Yuyao</p>
<p>Jin Chuntai and others sentenced to imprisonment. In the case of Jin Chuntai and others falsely accusing communists in Zhangzhen, Hu Bingheng, the former auditor, illegally declared them innocent. Bei Zairan and others appealed to the High Court, which summoned the files and interrogated them many times. According to reliable information, the High Court has sentenced Jin Chuntai to one year of imprisonment and his second son, Fengbiao, to three years of imprisonment at the end of last month.</p>
<p>Villagers petition to change the village boundaries. The former village of Yaosi, near Wanshi, was assigned to the joint village organized by Jiayi Zhang by the Huangba Village and Neighborhood Preparatory Committee. Recently, villagers Wang Laifa and others submitted a petition to the county government stating various reasons for their willingness to belong to Wanshi, because the villagers of Wanshi and Yaosi are of the same clan, have the same customs, and are located in a mountain area with frequent banditry. The Wanshi Security Corps has been in operation for many years and can protect the village. Therefore, the villagers do not want to belong to Jiayi Zhang and have petitioned the Village and Neighborhood Preparatory Committee of the county government.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Implementing the Party's Education Policy Proposal <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>▲ Original Proposal by Zhu Jiahua and Chu Minyi</p>
<p>At the Third Plenary Session, Zhu Jiahua and Chu Minyi jointly proposed a plan to vigorously implement the Party's education policy. After review by the education group, it was decided to submit it to the Political Council for discussion. The proposal is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Education is the foundation of a nation and the mother of all revolutionary construction. Therefore, when the Party began its political tutelage, it established the purpose and implementation policy of education ("The Education Purpose and Its Implementation Policy Proposal Determined by the Brothers at the Third National Congress") so that it could be effectively implemented along this path. This would not only sweep away the bad consequences of past education, but also lay the foundation for the construction of the Three Principles of the People. However, in the past year, chaos has arisen one after another, and the revolutionary order and construction achieved through past efforts have almost been destroyed. The Party's original education policy has therefore been unable to advance. Now that the rebellion has been completely quelled and the obstacles have been removed, we must, in our deep reflection and sorrow, have the greatest determination and effort to realize the Party's education policy. Politics and education go hand in hand. The development of education depends on political stability, but if we want to promote the people's ability to self-govern and create a sound political order, nothing is more important than the popularization of education.</p>
<p>The Party's education policy has clear regulations for various education facilities. For the sake of the education of the entire country, we should take into consideration all aspects and avoid bias. However, considering the current national environment and the needs of the people, there must be a distinction between priorities and urgency. Now that political tutelage has just begun, the Party's greatest responsibility is to promote local autonomy and develop the national economy. To achieve this goal, we must do our best to eliminate illiteracy and increase production. Our country has never had accurate education statistics. According to recent surveys, the total population of the country is 444,715,4951 people, with approximately 42,560,000 out-of-school children and approximately 21,160,000 out-of-school adults. The total number of out-of-school people in the country is approximately 25,272,000. This survey has not been very accurate, so in reality, the number is likely to be even higher. Even based on this, the number of illiterate people in the country exceeds half of the population. It is clearly impossible for a people with the majority uneducated to exercise self-government and civil rights. Our country's economy is backward and production efficiency is declining. Taking grain as an example, according to the customs survey in the 16th year of the Republic of China, the total value of imported rice, wheat, and flour was as high as 135,605,000 taels. Our country has always been proud of its abundant agricultural production, but the result is such. It is truly lamentable. Therefore, if we want to save the bankruptcy of the national economy today, we must first strive to increase production efficiency. Based on these two major needs, we believe that the fundamental education that must be urgently implemented at present is compulsory national education, adult literacy education, and vocational education, all centered on cultivating national life skills.</p>
<p>However, to implement compulsory national education and adult literacy education, a large number of teachers must first be trained. At a standard of one teacher for every 250,000 people, more than 10 million teachers are needed to meet the demand. Such a huge need cannot be met without establishing many specialized schools. Moreover, these teachers have a special national mission and should receive special training that cannot be equated with ordinary education. Therefore, normal schools should be established independently and not be appendages of other schools. The length of schooling should be increased, training should be intensified, treatment should be improved, and the new salary of primary school teachers should be raised to create a sound foundation for normal school education. At the same time, incumbent primary school teachers and private school teachers should be trained separately during holidays each year. The lack of good primary school teachers has become a major problem. According to the statistics of the Zhejiang Education Department in the 17th year, only 41% of the province's primary school teachers had received normal school education, while the remaining 59% had not. The general private school teachers are not included. If these unqualified teachers are severely cracked down on, it is feared that the number of out-of-school people will increase even more during this transition period. Therefore, we have to actively plan and remedy the situation.</p>
<p>Vocational education has long been neglected in our country. The various vocational schools run by various provinces are mostly based on books, lack experimental equipment, and do not correspond to the local production environment. After graduation, there is no suitable outlet or guarantee. Therefore, the effect is equal to zero. In the future, we must vigorously correct the previous malpractices. The establishment of schools must be based on adapting to the local production needs as the main condition. Experimental factories should be set up in industrial areas and agricultural experiment stations should be set up in agricultural areas. On the one hand, they are used for students to practice, and on the other hand, they are the basis for transforming local production. We should also prepare for their livelihood and provide reliable guarantees so that they can achieve the goal of making the best use of their talents, land, materials, and flow. At the same time, vocational education should be implemented in the army for future reclamation, road construction, and other production purposes. This can not only turn profit into profit, but also be a fundamental plan to eliminate war, save the country, and save danger.</p>
<p>The Party's education policy takes equal educational opportunity as a basic principle. However, the current school education is clearly the privilege of a few wealthy people. The general poor children not only have no hope of receiving secondary education, but also cannot receive primary education. If this deformed education system is not fundamentally broken, the goal of universal education will never be achieved. Therefore, we advocate that all schools in the country should be free of charge so that poor youth can develop their talents. However, given the current financial difficulties, it is impossible to achieve this in a short time. We can only first exempt tuition fees for Party-run compulsory schools, adult literacy schools, and normal schools. The remaining secondary and above schools will first set up a certain number of free places and increase them year by year. When the education fees are sufficient, they will be fully exempted. The state should also subsidize and reward those who are interested in studying advanced academics. This is the minimum necessary condition for implementing the Party's education policy. Otherwise, even if we want to vigorously promote universal education, what can we do if the facts do not allow it? Finally, what we urgently need to fundamentally solve is the problem of education funding. If there is no sufficient preparation and guarantee for education funding, all plans will become pie in the sky. Judging from the current situation of education funding, it is not only insufficient to promote the Party's education policy, but it is also difficult to maintain the status quo. Therefore, for short-term solutions, we must first implement the already determined education funding. For long-term solutions, the central government and various provinces should stipulate 20% to 30% of the annual revenue as education funding, and an independent guarantee system must be established. We must also break the past fallacy of "local education is run with local funds." The central government should plan in a unified way to make education develop evenly in various places. Only in this way can the Party's education policy be thoroughly implemented. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e63">The Jiangsu Middle School Association Requests a Meeting <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Jiangsu Education Funding Committee</p>
<p>Wang Maozu, Xue Deyi, and Zhou Hougui, standing committee members of the Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Association, submitted a document to Niu, Director of the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office, stating that the annual funding for provincial middle schools cannot be maintained according to the budget. It is hoped that the director will review the matter and quickly convene a meeting of the funding committee to discuss relief measures to facilitate progress. It is noted that the schools' operations have been increasing year by year, but the budget is still based on old standards. When the previous funding committee discussed the budget for this year, it included middle school tuition and dormitory fees and school agricultural income into the budget. The representatives of the association present at the meeting stated the reasons, but could not arouse the sympathy of the committee members present. Therefore, this year's budget has actually decreased by about 20% compared to the previous year. Previously, the schools' funding shortages could be compensated by tuition and dormitory fees. Now, there is no room for flexibility. If the budget for this year is prepared in accordance with the budget issued by the Education Department, the original operations will inevitably be suspended if the revenue and expenditure are to be balanced, let alone expanded. Therefore, the budget prepared by each school has to exceed the budget. Up to now, the budget has not been prepared. Now, fortunately, you have returned to the province to preside over the matter. Therefore, we sincerely appeal to you to convene a meeting of the funding committee to find a fundamental solution. In addition, how should the temporary budget for the 18th year be allocated? It should also be announced immediately. How should the boarding expenses of normal school students be compensated in this autumn when rice is like pearls and firewood is like cinnamon? When should the security deposits of this year's normal school graduates be returned for sightseeing? These matters cannot be resolved without the funding committee. We beg you to understand our difficulties and approve the convening of a meeting of the funding committee to discuss relief measures to facilitate the progress of education.</p>

<h3 id="e64">The Municipal Education Bureau Restricts the Admission of Transfer Students at All Levels <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau: The number of transfer students in schools at all levels in the city has been increasing recently, and the level of students varies, which has made education difficult. The reasons for the transfer are as follows: 1. Changes in the occupation of parents and brothers, and the relocation of families, often cause students to change schools. 2. A large number of students request transfers because their level is too low to be promoted to the next grade. 3. Bad conduct and repeated admonitions have not been corrected, and the school authorities have to order them to withdraw from school. 4. There are many who are ambitious and want to leapfrog grades. 5. Some are dissatisfied with the school's measures and voluntarily request a transfer. 6. The school is closed (referring to a private school). Except for the first and sixth reasons, which are unavoidable and should be accommodated, other transfer students are either too low in level, or have bad conduct, or are ambitious and arrogant, or are nitpicking and arbitrarily attacking. If they are allowed to leave this school for another without restriction, it will not only cause problems in education, but also affect moral education. The future of education is very important. Therefore, the following measures are proposed to restrict the admission of transfer students in schools at all levels in the city: 1. Transfer students who have not studied in this school for more than one year shall not be given a graduation certificate. Primary school students under the age of 15 who have moved their home or have other legitimate reasons, and whose level is equal, and who have a transfer certificate and a letter of introduction from the principal, are not subject to this restriction. 2. Transfer students must first present their transfer certificate or score sheet for verification before being allowed to take the entrance examination. 3. Schools shall not accept requests for student transfers after classes have been going on for more than two weeks. 4. Those who are of poor level and bad conduct, and who are deemed by the school authorities to be hopeless and ordered to withdraw from school, shall not be allowed to transfer. 5. Students from afar who have not yet prepared their transfer certificate and are deemed satisfactory after the entrance examination may be allowed to temporarily audit.</p>

<h3 id="e66">The Municipal Education Bureau Urges Filling Out the Middle School Teacher Form <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday ordered all middle schools, saying, "In order to urge the matter, the Ministry of Education issued an order to the education administrative organs of various provinces and cities to clearly report the matter, including the academic qualifications, experience, positions, salaries, full-time or part-time, etc. of the principals and teachers of various middle schools. After the beginning of each semester, report it once within one month. The form was issued on December 21st of the 18th year, and it was quickly and detailedly filled out and sent. Now it is urgently needed to be sent to the school that has not yet filled it out. Therefore, the principal should fill it out clearly and submit it to the bureau within a few days for reporting. Do not continue to delay. This is very important."</p>
<h3 id="e67">The Shanghai South District Education Association Holds a Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>

<h3 id="e68">The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau's Business Report at the Sixth Municipal Congress (5) <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>(3) Upcoming Business</p>
<p>1.  Increase the number of classes in municipal schools. Compulsory education in this city has not yet been popularized. The number of classes in each municipal school should be increased to avoid leaving out students who have registered. At the beginning of each semester, the bureau will select the municipal school with the most registered students and add classes as appropriate. However, it is still not possible to accommodate all of them, and more will need to be added one after another. We will try our best to increase the number of classes within the limits of economic possibility to reduce the number of out-of-school children.</p>
<p>2.  Repair municipal school buildings. It is not possible to repair the school buildings of each municipal school at the same time without this financial resources. We have to prioritize the projects. The Municipal School Building Repair Committee has made overall plans, sorted out the construction fees collected by various municipal schools, surveyed the projects, determined the order of repairs, and prepared a budget, which the bureau will submit to the municipal government for approval.</p>
<p>(4) Difficulties</p>
<p>1. Failure to unify educational rights</p>
<p>(1) Educational rights in the concessions. This special municipality is divided into concessions, and the powers are not unified, which makes it difficult to handle matters. Private schools with a general purpose other than education rely on the concessions and harm young people. The bureau has taken measures to ban them, but some have disobeyed in public and obeyed in private, while others have moved to avoid them. Therefore, there is no education to speak of in the concessions. It is not easy to thoroughly rectify the situation without taking back the educational rights of the concessions.</p>
<p>(2) Provincial educational rights. This special municipality does not belong to the scope of the province, but is an administrative region directly under the National Government. However, there are provincial schools in the urban area, and the educational assets that this city should receive have not yet been fully transferred. This is also a lack of unified powers, which hinders the progress of business.</p>
<p>2. The exhaustion of educational funds</p>
<p>This city has a dense population and prosperous industry and commerce. School education and social education need to be actively promoted. As there are many projects, the funds have also increased. Although the educational funds of this city have been repeatedly increased in recent years, they are still difficult to allocate due to the amount of work that needs to be done. Therefore, the budget has been reduced again and again, which is like cutting one's feet to fit one's shoes. The lack of economic resources is indeed a difficulty in developing education.</p>
<p>(5) Hopes</p>
<p>1. Hope that the Party Headquarters and citizens will cooperate</p>
<p>Education is related to the foundation of the country. The bureau's responsibility is to do its best to develop education. We also hope that the Party Headquarters will lead the citizens and the municipal government to cooperate to make the city's education more developed.</p>
<p>2. Hope for unified educational rights</p>
<p>The lack of unified powers and the division of policies hinder the progress of education. The city's educational administration feels quite constrained, and all facilities have not been thoroughly implemented. We deeply hope that the educational rights in this city will be unified as soon as possible to facilitate the function of educational administration (End)</p>

<p>(1) Women's Basketball Rules</p>
<p>▲ Still using the Spalding Rules</p>
<p>The Organizing Committee of the National Games specially added a women's basketball event to promote suitable sports for women and published the rules for the event. It is found that the women's basketball rules announced by this year's Far Eastern Games stipulated the use of men's rules. The association believed that the originally adopted Spalding regulations had already been announced in advance and could not be changed. Fearing that there would be misunderstandings, it specially sent letters to various provinces and cities for reference yesterday. The Kang letter is recorded as follows: "Dear Sirs, there has been no women's basketball in previous Far Eastern Games. This association has specially added this sport to the list of events to promote suitable sports and has announced the adoption of women's basketball rules. It is found that the women's basketball has been included in the performance competition of this year's Far Eastern Games and has only recently announced the adoption of men's rules. This association does not change the rules that have been stipulated in advance. Fearing that there would be misunderstandings, we hereby inform you. In addition, each team has twelve players in women's volleyball, and the number of players can be increased to seventeen. We hereby inform you and hope that you will refer to it and help publicize it."</p>
<p>(2) Types of Participation in Guangdong</p>

<p>Today's Four University Athletic Association Basketball Championship will open at 4:00 pm in the Shanghai Baptist University Gymnasium in Yangshupu. The original participants included Soochow, Jinling, Shanghai Baptist University, and Zhejiang University. Yesterday morning, Mr. Song, an employee of the association, received a letter from Zhejiang University stating that it could not attend the meeting due to reasons. Therefore, only Jinling, Soochow, and Shanghai Baptist University remain to compete. Jinling athletes arrived in Shanghai yesterday and are now staying at the school. However, the team stated that it must complete the competition within the next two days in order to rush back to the capital in time to participate in the local games. Soochow is scheduled to come to Shanghai this morning, so the order of the competition cannot be determined in advance. All that can be decided is that Jinling will play either Soochow or Shanghai Baptist University at 4:00 pm today. If Jinling plays Soochow today, then Jinling will definitely play Shanghai Baptist University at 3:00 pm tomorrow. The opposite is also true. At 4:00 pm on the 10th, Soochow and Shanghai Baptist University will definitely clash. The referees have been appointed by Mr. Song, an employee of the association. Xu Zhendong on the first day, Zhang Guoxun on the second day, and Smith on the third day.</p>

<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The spring cold is still sharp. I stayed at home and didn't go out. Suddenly, Xu Zihanqing arrived with a light and swift step, bringing the joy of a rare visitor to a secluded valley. Hanqing is a zoologist. My friends and I pestered him to talk about beasts to break the silence. Thus, I recorded some of what we discussed on the left.</p>
<p>Zebras are produced in the southeastern part of both North and South America. However, their reproduction is not prolific, and they are difficult to tame. They cannot be used to serve people like ordinary horses. Their color is white or light yellow, encircled by black or brown stripes, resembling a rabbit. It is quite a spectacle. English and German zoologists, lamenting that Europe does not produce these horses, devised a method to obtain them. Their method is quite interesting. They cause black horses and white horses to mate. During mating, they specifically emit a strange electric light. Sometimes it turns brown, sometimes black, sometimes yellow, and sometimes white. They make these colors flash alternately in the horses' eyes. When they conceive and give birth, the patterns are exactly like a zebra's. This is also quite extraordinary.</p>
<p>Sichuan has many mountains. Monkeys dwell in the caves and crevices, forming groups of hundreds or thousands. Therefore, Li Bai has the line, "The monkeys' cries on both banks cannot be stopped, my light boat has already passed ten thousand mountains." Monkeys love to eat fruit. Those who capture them often lure them with fruit. They load the boat full of fruit and anchor at the edge of the stream at night. The people hide in the belly of the boat, completely silent. When the monkeys see the fruit piled up, they all climb over rocks and trees to reach it, swallowing peaches and gnawing plums, enjoying themselves immensely. The boat is deliberately equipped with a mechanism. When pressed, the deck tilts. The monkeys stealing fruit all fall into the boat. Monkeys fear being killed and also hate seeing blood. Therefore, they deliberately kill a chicken and drain its blood. This frightens them so much that they dare not move, and they are all tied up with ropes. There is a saying, "Kill a chicken to show the monkey." This saying has its origins.</p>
<h3 id="e79">New Sparrow Talk <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— A Guest Returning with Refreshed Eyes</p>
<p>Among today's entertainment devices that can anesthetize the whole country and gradually spread to the Atlantic Ocean, none is like mahjong. My friend Gu Zinan told me about two recent small news stories related to mahjong within the last ten days. Therefore, I compiled them into the "New Sparrow Talk" as follows.</p>
<p>There is a good match in this. A man named Chen Yongquan was asked to celebrate someone's birthday last Tuesday. He was strongly pulled into joining a mahjong game by the guests. Yongquan is usually timid in such situations, mainly due to economic pressure. On that day, they played twelve rounds. His losses were less than one silver dollar. However, he was already sweating as if steamed, and his face was the color of pig liver. Yesterday, Zinan heard someone say that Yongquan had already found a beautiful wife and would be getting married on the upcoming Sunday (March 16th). Zinan further investigated the matter. Only then did he learn that the good match was found in the mahjong game. On that day, the mahjong game was at its peak. The player above Yongquan was the dealer, discarding a four of characters to eat a seven of characters. The player below, a young lady, had thrown away a red dragon as her first discard. Yongquan then changed one red dragon into three. As the situation became tense, he even discarded one red dragon, waiting for a five or eight of characters. He drew one himself and won. The young lady was waiting for a closed six of characters. Everyone blamed Yongquan for not discarding the red dragon earlier. The young lady smiled and said, "What are you saying? The dealer was obviously going for a pure suit. Sacrificing the red dragon to avoid giving a big win is truly stable and skillful." An old man standing behind the young lady nodded in agreement. During the dinner, he asked Yongquan about his family finances and living situation in detail. It turned out that the old man was the young lady's father. He knew his daughter's heart had been won, so he seized the opportunity to create a good match. The next day, he hired a matchmaker. In less than three days, they had agreed on the marriage. Discarding one red dragon led to a good thing. How wonderful! Therefore, it is said, "There is a good match in this."</p>
<p>Gaining Ten Thousand and Losing One Thousand Zinan also said, "Things have their fortunes and misfortunes. They cannot be reasoned with normal logic." The day after Yongquan's mahjong game, I visited a friend in Ximen for some business. My friend was in a mahjong game, so I stood aside and joined the crowd watching the game. One player was waiting for a three, six, or nine of bamboos. He suddenly kept the one of characters he drew, discarding the nine of bamboos, abandoning the three wait for a one wait. After shuffling the tiles twice, he drew one himself and won. Some laughed at him for not knowing the rules of the game. Others envied his lucky hand. The person behind the player across from him said, "Amazing skill! How could he have foreseen it?" It turned out that the opponent had a pair of white dragons and had discarded a red dragon. He had been waiting for a one or four of characters for a long time and had suffered this setback. That person was also very pleased with himself, tirelessly recounting when he knew that his opponent was close to winning and when he knew that he was waiting for characters. I didn't want to wait any longer and left. Now I hear that the opponent is very resentful. The two sides had originally planned to jointly invest in a business, with an investment of one thousand yuan. Now he has made excuses to cancel the contract, as there was no contract signed, so he is not bound by breach of contract. Isn't this gaining ten thousand and losing one thousand? I didn't have time to ask for that person's name. Zinan also didn't mention it. How unlucky that person is! Chen Yongquan is truly lucky.</p>
<h3 id="e80">A Rare Story of Discovering Bird Shapes in a Tree <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaochang</p>
<p>The other day, I attended a celebratory banquet at my classmate Cheng Jun's house. During the meal, I heard Cheng Jun's uncle, Wang Baotian, tell a story about discovering bird shapes in a tree. It was truly a rare story. Therefore, I transcribed it here for the research of scholars across the country.</p>
<p>Wang is over sixty years old. He is from the northern village of Lin'an. His family's business is selling trees. Thirty years ago, Wang went to Yuqian to sell trees. He bought a chestnut tree for two hundred silver coins. In the middle of the tree, there was a tree growing in the mountain valley, about thirty feet long and three feet one or two inches in circumference. It was called the "Bird Stop," because the branches and leaves of the tree were covered with thorns, so birds could not stop on it. Wang had heard his ancestors say that if the circumference of a "Bird Stop" tree was two feet, there would be bird shapes inside the tree. However, very large trees of this type are extremely rare, because their texture is unusually dense and they do not grow easily. Any tree with a circumference of about one foot must be over a hundred years old. Therefore, after Wang obtained the tree, he removed its branches and split it in two to see what was inside. Unexpectedly, there were dozens of bird shapes in the tree, each with a different posture, scattered within a ten-foot section of the tree's middle. Wang was overjoyed and carried the split tree back home, intending to split it further into several thin planks. However, the bird shapes that had already been split were very blurred and incomplete. Wang's colleague, an old man, learned about this. He told Wang, "When splitting a tree with a saw, if you saw it for too long, the saw will get hot. When splitting a tree that has bird shapes, you must avoid the saw getting hot. Because once the saw gets hot, the bird shapes in the tree will definitely become blurred. If you want to avoid this problem, you should prepare several saws when splitting. After sawing for a short time, switch to another saw. If you rotate the saws in this way, the saw will not get hot." Wang followed his advice and split the tree again. The bird shapes were indeed very clear. This was truly a rare treasure. After removing the outer edges of the tree, a total of twenty-five planks were split, each with bird shapes on both sides. Wang sold them one by one (they were used to make screens and tabletops, which were quite valuable, selling for fifty or sixty silver dollars per plank. Four of them were bought by a newly appointed magistrate to present to his superiors. These were worth a total of four hundred and ten silver dollars). This tree earned a total of over one thousand five hundred silver dollars. Wang's family was originally poor. After receiving this benefit, they gradually became well-off. Now they have some assets and can live comfortably.</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Wedding Night <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Jingbai</p>
<p>With the eastward spread of Western customs, the voices of free love and free marriage often resound in our ears. Young men and women all regard them as golden rules. As for the old-fashioned marriage system, the parents' orders and the matchmaker's words, if you talk to today's youth about them, they will all cover their ears and run away, scoffing at them. Unexpectedly, my old friend Yuan, as an extremely modern person, recently had an old-fashioned marriage. The result was sweet and fulfilling, leading him to make extremely brilliant remarks. Yuan's words were so wonderful, how could I not record them?</p>
<p>My old friend Yuan is studying at a certain middle school. He is intelligent and studious, and his grades are the best among his peers. Recently, he held a beautiful wedding ceremony. The next day, dozens of classmates went to congratulate him. I was also fortunate enough to attend and enjoy the lavish feast. The group strongly urged the newlywed to announce the wedding process and the secrets of the first night. Yuan looked around. There was no one else in the room but his fellow students. Joking and teasing were common among them. Therefore, he had no need to be shy. He announced it to them frankly. Everyone listened intently, more focused than when they were receiving lessons in the classroom. Yuan ordered the cups to be washed and more wine to be poured in preparation for both recording his words and drinking. The Book of Han can be enjoyed with wine, and brilliant words can indeed add to the meal. Then, Yuan, with a smile on his face, made his brilliant remarks: "People say that old-fashioned marriages are blind marriages. I think that's a big mistake. Free love, when it comes to marriage, is the announcement of the end of love. There is no more progress to be made, and it becomes boring. Those who encounter misfortune are countless. Only old-fashioned marriages are the starting point of love. The romance in the boudoir will only increase. As for the wedding process, since it was old-fashioned, there is no so-called process. But the joy of the first night will never be forgotten. When the night is quiet, I entered the bridal chamber. There was a beautiful woman, sitting silently in beautiful makeup. Looking up, I saw the bright moon in the sky, and three stars entered the room. I suspected that the Guanghan Palace was not necessarily in the clouds. So, I slowly approached her seat and slowly started a conversation. She was shy and seemed overwhelmed with emotion. Then, we held hands and entered the bedchamber. The situation inside can only be shared with those who have experienced it and cannot be told to outsiders. On the other hand, with free marriages, the path is well-worn. Can there be such mystery and joy? Most of my colleagues have not experienced this. Whether his words are true or not, I record it here as a reference for the future."</p>

<p>— Tang Bihua</p>
<p>The newspaper vendors who follow rickshaws at the wharf station are the most unreliable. You often easily buy stale newspapers from the previous day.</p>
<p>Do not be fooled by those on the street impersonating demobilized soldiers and peddling jewels. Also, do not be greedy for cheap ivory chopsticks or soap. Otherwise, you will lose more than you gain.</p>
<p>When traveling, if you have luggage, be sure to copy the number on the luggage tag into your diary. If you lose your luggage tag, you can report it to the station at your destination, explaining the number, the number of pieces of luggage, and the items inside. You can have your belongings returned to you without fail.</p>
<p>Do not take pictures with friends you meet by chance. If you encounter a bad person, trouble will arise as a result, damaging your reputation. You must be careful.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Detailed Record of the Abolition of Prostitution Lottery in Hangzhou <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Songlu, reporting from Hangzhou</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Government, in order to completely relieve the suffering of prostitutes, has initiated a phased lottery system to abolish prostitution. March 1st was the date for the first implementation of the lottery. Because I considered this event unprecedented in Hangzhou, I felt I must go and observe it. However, I was accustomed to waking up late, so I was afraid that I would lose sleep at the critical moment. Therefore, the day before, I hired a car with a friend to go to Gongchen Bridge and stayed at Dafang Inn so that I could go and observe it at ease the next day.</p>
<p>The homes announce the news at dawn The next day at dawn, I was awakened by the sound of knocking on doors in the neighboring houses. Upon asking, I learned that it was the police announcing the news to each house by calling out to the drum girls. So we quickly got up and brushed our teeth.</p>
<p>The venue at Wang Zhuang is solemn and orderly The lottery venue for the day was set up at the Ronghua Theater. There were not many seats. Yu Jimin, the section chief of the Public Security Bureau in charge of the matter, had arrived before me. When he saw me, he led me to the reporters' seat and told me about the preparations for the lottery. At this time, the venue was quite solemn and orderly. Dozens of prostitutes had arrived and were seated in the front row. Their madams and aunties were seated in the boxes upstairs. There was a couplet hanging in front of the stage, which read: "(Alas, the leaves and flowers compete for beauty. They flutter and fly, defiling the northern villages of the Sui Dynasty. May the orioles and swallows strive to be the first to welcome the east wind to gather in the imperial gardens.)" Although the sentences were not well-crafted, they were still interesting. To the left of the stage, behind the seats for photographs, there was a display of red flowers, which were prepared as identifiers for the abolished prostitutes to wear. There were eight characters written on a red silk banner: "(Escape the fire pit, restore your personality.)" This was also quite alert.</p>
<p>Alert and interesting slogans Slogans were posted all around the venue. The sentences were mostly alert and interesting, such as "(Prostitutes who are drawn to be abolished have accumulated the virtue of their ancestors.)" "(Once you are drawn to be abolished, you are still a pure girl.)" "(From now on, you will see the light of day.)" "(It is too late to awaken when you are old and faded.)" etc.</p>
<p>Mac's speech makes the hall laugh After the opening remarks, Chairman Li Zicai finished his speech, and representatives from various agencies spoke in succession. Then, Mike, a police advisor from the Department of Civil Affairs, gave a speech. Mike was not accustomed to speaking Chinese and spoke in English. As soon as he finished speaking, he made the whole hall laugh.</p>
<p>The number of people who should be abolished this time The number of prostitutes who should be abolished this time was as follows: There were originally thirty-eight first-class prostitutes in Gongchen Bridge. Excluding three who had stopped working and twelve who were supported by patrons, one-sixth of the twenty-three should be drawn, totaling four. There were two hundred and ninety-seven second-class prostitutes. Excluding one hundred and twenty-eight who were supported by patrons, one-sixth of the one hundred and sixty-nine should be drawn, totaling twenty-eight. The total was thirty-one.</p>
<p>The lottery procedure is precise The lottery tickets were made of bamboo, with the words "abolished" and "retained" written on them. They were each wrapped in white paper. When drawing the tickets, the seal had to be broken and examined. Each prostitute drew her own ticket. The method was truly meticulous and strict.</p>
<p>Various interesting anecdotes during the lottery There were many interesting anecdotes during the lottery. Here are a few excerpts: (1) First-class prostitute Chuchu did not arrive that day due to smallpox. After proof was provided, her madam was allowed to draw on her behalf. Unexpectedly, she drew "abolished." So this old madam, who was over sixty years old, temporarily took the prostitute's place. (2) Second-class prostitute Lin Zhicao was over fifty years old. She still sang and entertained people on weekdays. She also drew the word "abolished" that day. The audience laughed when she wore a red flower on her chest. (3) Second-class prostitute Hongdi was twenty-eight years old. She was a clerk supported by patrons at Zhu Zhang's place. She arrived that day wearing a long skirt and short coat. She was calm and composed. When she was summoned, she said to the person checking her photos, "I have already paid off my debt and am willing to be a good woman. Now, please return my certificate so that I can go home with my guest (her lover)."</p>
<p>Why shed tears after being drawn? On that day, the prostitutes who were drawn to be abolished all shed tears and cried bitterly. Some even lay on the ground and cried uncontrollably. Alas, was this because they were surrounded by the environment, or was it their nature? I truly do not understand.</p>
<p>The cries at Jiliang Hall shake the earth Afterwards, I went to visit Jiliang Hall. When I arrived, the cries shook the earth, making it unbearable to hear. Some who recognized me pulled at my clothes and begged for help. I smiled and said, "You are jumping out of the fire pit. You should be happy, why are you so sad? Soon, your patrons will come to marry you and take you home for a reunion." The prostitutes were still skeptical. Then, the representatives of the Women's Association, Lin Song and Wang Wei, spoke in succession, earnestly advising them. Only then did they stop crying, express their gratitude, and smile through their tears.</p>
<p>Various after-the-fact tidbits of news After the reporters left Jiliang Hall, they went to sit in a teahouse. The street talk and gossip were varied. Here are a few: (1) First-class prostitute Chuchu originally used her own daughter as a prostitute. Now she has been drawn to be abolished and has a debt of four thousand yuan. (2) Second-class prostitute Liu Xiuying, although she worked independently, spent lavishly on weekdays. Her debt also reached more than nine hundred yuan. (3) Wenjun was a leader among the second-class prostitutes. She had elderly parents and a young child still in swaddling clothes. They all relied on her for a living. Once she was drawn, her elderly parents were extremely sad and heartbroken. (4) Second-class prostitute Miaoyun had a thriving business and was good at saving money. She had already saved more than five hundred silver coins. She was reluctant to leave this fire pit. Being drawn this time can be said to be self-inflicted trouble.</p>
<h3 id="e84">A Strange Drama After the Abolition of Prostitution in Hangzhou <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Songlu, reporting from Hangzhou</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Government, in order to improve women's rights and liberate women, has initiated a lottery system to abolish prostitution. The circumstances of its progress have already been reported in yesterday's draft. Unexpectedly, a strange change has occurred that is beyond expectations. The prostitutes who were abolished and kept in Jiliang Hall were completely robbed by madams and others. The matter is truly shocking to hear. I have explored and described its process and sent it by express mail to the Free Talk section.</p>
<p>Previously, the Public Security Bureau kept the follow-up measures for the abolition of prostitution strictly secret. Therefore, the prostitutes who were abolished at that time all cried with tears, as if the pain in Jiliang Hall was worse than in prison. After the lottery, these forty-odd abolished prostitutes were sent to Jiliang Hall together. The rooms in the hall were quite cramped. At this time, there was a sense of few rooms and many people, making it difficult to find space to sit. At the same time, the pimps and madams of the brothels were seeking help everywhere, asking to be temporarily released on bail. Dai Shuming, the chief of the third district, considered it reasonable and granted their request. At one time, more than twenty people were released on bail. When Yu Jimin, the second section chief of the Public Security Bureau, heard about this, he strongly disapproved, saying that since the prostitutes had been abolished, how could they be temporarily released on bail? He ordered them to be recalled one by one and sent to the hall. When the general pimps and madams heard this news, they felt that the government was going back on its word and were quite indignant. At the same time, rumors spread, saying that these abolished prostitutes would be sent into the city. So they gathered local hooligans and thugs and carried out a robbery at Jiliang Hall. Sure enough, Jiliang Hall was completely unprepared and was broken into. All the prostitutes were robbed. Afterwards, the district authorities sent police to pursue and arrest them, but they gained nothing. They ordered the pimps and madams of the brothels to hand over the people. The brothels claimed that the incident occurred at Jiliang Hall and that it was difficult to be responsible for tracking them down. As of the time of this submission, there was still no proper solution. However, Gongchen Bridge is a small place with inconvenient transportation, and prostitutes are easily identified. It will not be difficult to catch them one by one.</p>

<h3 id="e85">The Financial Gold Rush Gradually Returns to Calm <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Silver Prices and Foreign Exchange Rates Rebound and Are Not Set Back</p>
<p>The Tax Bill Lacks Sympathy and Is Not Likely to Pass</p>
<p>Psychologically Anxious, the Market Stumbles. Yesterday, the sixth day of the gold auction frenzy, temporarily came to an end. However, the psychology of those in the industry remained anxious, and the price changed from high to low, eventually rising slightly. In the morning market, there was a fluctuation of seven or eight taels. There were more buyers than sellers in the industry. Yongchengchang, Yuanxing, Yongyufeng, Yongwanxing, and others all increased their purchases. Hengxing, Taixing, Yuanmao Yong, and others were all selling. Exchange rates weakened after strengthening. Although large amounts were available in the early morning market, they were not affected. This was mainly because buyers were active, as the international community did not approve of the tax on silver and the previous agreement might be canceled. Therefore, people's hearts were firm. Afterwards, sellers took advantage of the situation, and foreign exchange rates increased by one grade, then plummeted. Suddenly, it broke through 494 taels. Then, because large investors competed to buy and banks absorbed cash, exchange rates also rose sharply by six or seven taels. However, at noon, many parties sold off, suddenly turning against the wind. In the afternoon market, the rise and fall were also as much as six taels, with unpredictable twists and turns, making it difficult to grasp. Taixing, Yifeng Yong, Fuchang, and others all purchased. Hengfeng Yu, Dashunli Wanxing, and others sold off slightly. As a result, prices were within 500 taels, and exchange rates seemed to stabilize. As for the London silver bar, the recent return was up five-sixteenths, and the far-term only added one-sixteenth. The silver price rose by one cent, and the exchange rate remained the same.</p>
<p>The April auction of gold opened high, adding 1.7 taels. The April auction of gold opened high, at 499 taels and 5 mace, adding 1.7 mace, which was due to the stability of people's hearts. The gross price retreated from 501 taels to 496 taels and 67 mace. The Cantonese gang and Yuanmao Yong and others were still keen to sell. The exchange rate stabilized. Among those in the industry, mutual trading of June English gold was done at 11 pence 3125. The bank made an offer for May at 11 pence 25 shillings, adding more than 2 taels at the time of announcement, to 99 taels. It was announced that the price had risen by 25 mace, the US dollar by half a yuan, and the Japanese gold had fallen by 1.25 cents, immediately falling by more than 1 tael. The domestic price was also wide. Sumitomo and Maizhongli mutually traded June English gold at 11 pence 4375. Shanghai bought 11 and a half pence for English gold, and Citibank bought 11 pence 375 mace for this month. Afterwards, it fell to 93 taels and 34 mace. At that time, there were many sellers. After 10 o'clock, it gradually rose because the bank absorbed cash and because Dalian should settle at 1.04 taels. Zhifeng Yong Yuanxing Yong and others bought in large quantities, so the price suddenly rose by four or five taels, to 98 and a half taels, briefly reducing by 2 mace. After 10:30, it rebounded by more than 4 taels. The market buyers were quite strong. HSBC also absorbed April English gold at 11 pence 25. By 11:15, it had reached 501 taels. Afterwards, the market turned weak, buying sentiment was not strong, and people's hearts softened. The noon close was 98 and a half taels.</p>
<p>The bank absorbs cash, and the closing price rises by 9 mace. The afternoon market opened down by 2.5 taels, at 96 taels, which was the residual momentum of the noon close. Then it was only 94 taels and 78 mace, and then suddenly rose by three or four taels, to 98 and a half taels, which was because the bank was buying notes. Suddenly, Hengxing came to sell, and it was reduced by 2 mace again, to 6 taels and 5 mace. It was also heard that the Indian exchange rate reported 23 yuan and 2.5 mace, which began to pick up. The Cantonese gang reinvested, and the bank wanted to buy spot goods. Holland, Mitsui, Great Britain, and others absorbed June English gold at 11 pence 375 mace. The recent price was 11 pence 25 mace to sell, so the price suddenly jumped three or four taels, to 500 taels 008 mace at 3:45. Afterwards, it turned weak again, retreating by one or two taels. After 4 o'clock, it had reached 98 taels, and soon rose by 1 tael to 9 taels and 1 mace. The market closed at 4:30 at 498 taels and 7 mace, which was an increase of 9 mace compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The exchange rate on the day is still pressed by about 30 taels. The maximum price on the first day was 501 taels, and the minimum price was 493 taels and 3 mace, a difference of 7 taels and 7 mace. The announced price has been changed to 527 taels and 4 mace, because it was reduced by 1.25 cents. From the morning, it was reduced by 28 taels to 33 or 34 taels. The noon close was pressed by 29 taels, and the book price was 98 taels to 99 taels. The supplemental water was 98 taels. In the afternoon, the supplemental water was 98 taels, and the announced price still had to be pressed by 31.2 taels to 28.9 taels. The goods opened at 98 taels and 2 mace in the morning, 8 taels at noon, 4 and a half taels in the afternoon, and closed at 9 taels and 7 mace.</p>
<p>The Dalian gang's purchases and sales are even.

<h3 id="e88">A Sudden and Extraordinary Panic in the Money Market <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Each bank adopts a self-preservation policy.</p>
<p>The circulation of discount notes is temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Large shortages create a tense situation.</p>
<p>The aftermath of the Yuda Bank's troubles</p>
<p>In the past two days, due to the Yuda Bank's suspension, the money houses adopted a self-preservation policy, and the circulation of discount notes was suddenly suspended, creating a tense situation. The rumors were rampant and unstoppable, so trading in the market turned cold. The discount rate in the early market was 7 qian 2 fen 0 hao 2.5 li, and in the afternoon market was 7 qian 2 fen 0.5 li. Silver discounts were usually done with white borrowing, and there were no transactions yesterday, so white borrowing was still listed. Overdrafts were done at 5 fen. Bank receipts were huge, totaling over 10 million in notes, exchange, goods, and pledges. Special receipts totaled over 10 million (including transfers to money houses). The amount of goods entering the warehouse was truly shocking, said to be over 10 million. The money houses did not have this huge amount of cash on hand, and turnover was particularly tight. But on the surface, the market prices did not fluctuate much. Trading in foreign currency notes in the market showed 890,000 in exchange transfers in the early market, and 920,000 in the afternoon market. Paper money was 10,000 in the early market, and 25,000 in the afternoon market. Over-the-counter paper money was 38,000 in the early market, and 54,000 in the afternoon market. Bank trading showed 500,000 in the early market, and 450,000 in the afternoon market. Foreign account receipts and payments between banks totaled over 1.2 million, and paper money inflows and outflows totaled over 2 million. Due to the special turmoil, it was impossible to calculate the amounts for the money houses' silver dollar public bills. The amount of silver dollar overdrafts to banks was not investigated and is omitted. Small money houses traded 400,000 to 500,000 in paper money transfers. In the subsidiary currency market, Jiangnan small silver dollars were 6 qian 1 fen 1 li in the early market, and the same in both markets, and there were no transactions. Guangdong small silver dollars were 5 qian 9 fen 7 li 2 hao 5 in the early market, and 5 qian 9 fen 7 li 7 hao 5 in the afternoon market. Trading volume was 140,000 jiao in the early market, and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins decreased by 2,500 wen, to 396,000. Over 29,000 strings of coins were traded.</p>

<p>Bond Prices Turn Bullish</p>
<p>Yesterday's public bond market in Shanghai saw very little spot trading. Only the Zheng Liu bonds saw slight trading in the morning, and other bonds were not offered. The futures market was generally active, and market trading was not deserted. The bond prices of 96, financial, and seven-year bonds remained stable due to scarce trading, with only slight fluctuations. However, due to the optimistic market sentiment and enthusiastic buying, the supply and demand gap was large, and prices soared, especially for customs bonds, which rose by one yuan in both the morning and afternoon sessions, and continued to rise by 1.4 yuan compared to the previous day. Post-reorganization bonds and continued debt bonds each rose by about one yuan. The Zheng Liu bonds and continued 25 bonds also rose by half a yuan. Total futures trading reached 7,570,000 yuan, with customs bonds being the most actively traded, accounting for over 3 million yuan, continued debt bonds 1,560,000 yuan, post-reorganization bonds over 400,000 yuan, and other bonds remaining calm, such as Zheng Liu bonds and continued 25 bonds at 560,000 to 70,000 yuan each, and 96 bonds and seven-year financial bonds each at only tens of thousands of yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market is flat and weak. The overseas raw cotton and yarn situation is extremely deteriorating. Most people expect lower prices. Sales in the market are even more sluggish. Customers say that the overall situation is chaotic, credit is tight, and business is cut off.</p>
<p>The post-auction yarn market is slightly stable. The opening price of the People's Auction market fell with the price of foreign cotton. Retail investors sold, and prices for all months fell by 8 or 9 qian. However, a large profit-taking investor took the opportunity to short-cover, and prices for all months rose by 7, 8, 9 qian to 1 liang 1 qian. In the afternoon, the market sentiment was more stable, and there were more short-covering activities. Prices for all months rose by 3, 4, 5 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 18,050 bales. The closing prices of the People's Auction are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the overseas cotton market continued its downward trend, with a turbulent situation and new low prices being discovered. As a result, most long positions were liquidated in large quantities, and the market situation loosened. Although the Han group's attitude was still firm and they continued to absorb, the global cotton market was sluggish, and Indian cotton was being sold cheaply. Moreover, the gold rush was extremely dangerous, so local cotton was falling into a tragic situation daily.</p>
<p>Han Auction: Major Holders Dump 7,000 Loads Weakly: The Han Auction's opening in the morning was based on the further decline in US cotton, creating a frightening situation. Retail investors were terrified, and the 34th group sold 6,900 loads in large quantities. Prices for all months fell by 3 qian and 4 qian. In the afternoon, there was some short-covering, and prices rose by 5 fen to 1 qian 5 fen. The total transaction volume for the day was 48,600 loads.

<p>External Market Continues Downward: Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market continued its downward trend due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, sluggish demand, and a quiet cloth market. Futures prices fell by 21 to 31 points, and spot prices fell by 30 points. English cotton futures fell by 6 to 7 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 10 points. Indian cotton was weak due to the decline in U.S. cotton and selling by European exporters.

<p>Yesterday, the demand for Yang rice increased, with outlets in Ningbo, the interior, and local towns and villages. Prices continued to rise by nearly one jiao. However, high-quality goods were scarce, and medium and lower grades were favored by customers, so the quality of medium and lower grades continued to improve. 8,000 bags of spot Xiaojiao were offered at a price of 13.5 yuan to 13.2 yuan. 1,000 bags of Dajiao were offered at a price of 12.95 yuan. 2,000 bags of Saigon No. 2 were offered at a price of 13.7 yuan to 13.65 yuan. Foreign firms continued to offer Xiaojiao futures, so the price of Xiaojiao was flat. Dajiao and other Saigon rice reversed and showed a positive trend.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Ganxian Rice Rises by More Than Two Jiao <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of Jiangxi machine-milled rice increased slightly. Ningbo and inland buyers showed strong interest. Newly arrived machine-milled rice was quickly sold in the morning and evening, causing the evening price to rise by 2.4 jiao, to 15.04 yuan. The morning price was 14.2 yuan, down to 13.65 yuan, also significantly higher than the previous market by a jiao or so. Only 48 bags of red rough rice were available, priced at 12.2 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Forward Wheat Prices Trend Higher <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the forward wheat prices were generally stable. The current month saw active demand and factory interest, so buyers were eager, and sellers were unwilling to lightly let go. As a result, trading was sparse, but market sentiment had turned bullish. Forward new wheat prices were stable due to unfavorable weather, and prices for various months showed a trend of gradually increasing. As a result, the current month was better than Tuesday by 4 fen, April was unchanged, July was better by 1 fen, July was better by 2 fen, and August was unchanged. The current wheat market saw stable prices for high-quality goods due to factory interest, while lower grades were flat. Yao Bay wheat was offered at 5.17 taels, Suzhou wheat at 5.17 taels, Gaoyou wheat at 5.14 taels, Shaoxing wheat at 5.14 taels, and Jiangxi wheat at 4.92 taels to 4.98 taels, totaling over 3,400 bags, which were purchased by Fuxin, Fufeng, and others.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market was generally quiet. The gold market changed ten thousand times a day, rising and falling unpredictably and difficult to grasp. Moreover, in the financial aspect, since the Yuda Bank's liquidation, people inside and outside the industry were worried about being implicated, so pure speculative trading was put aside, and people did not want to get involved. Furthermore, in terms of actual sales, the political situation in the north was still difficult to predict. If transportation was hindered, the current flour sales would inevitably become more sluggish. This was a major reason for the recent lack of market enthusiasm. Forward prices remained stable due to the cold weather. As a result, March and April prices returned to small 5 li compared to the closing price of the previous day, May small 7.5 li, June large 2.5 li, July unchanged, and August small 2.5 li.</p>

<p>After the price of imported foreign nails increased, local factories also wanted to raise prices repeatedly. However, due to the poor environment (previously due to strikes, followed by a shortage of raw materials), the market had been out of stock for many days. Yesterday, the factories officially sent letters announcing that the price would increase by one qian per barrel. It was said that over 2,000 to 3,000 barrels were offered, and they were purchased by local and foreign customers. The transaction prices are recorded below (in taels):</p>

<h3 id="e98">Sugar Market: Sugar Industry in Undecided Panic <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>A resolution is requested to extend the delivery period.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's communications from the production area stated that Cuban raw sugar was still 2.00, New York sugar futures for March were 1.67, and May were 1.76, each up by 9 points from the previous communication. September was 1.89, up 7 points, and December was 1.98, also up 6 points. Javanese raw sugar was priced at 10.00, and March futures were priced at 10.35, each down by 25 points. April was 10.375, down 125 points. After several businesses went under, the market sentiment became panicked, and the buying mood was quiet. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white was priced at 7.05 taels, Japanese sugar N mark at 7.7 qian, and YT mark at 7.6 qian, but there were no takers. Only J mark at 7.975 taels and ground No. 20 fine sand white at 6.925 taels had a few slight transactions. The market was flat and weak. In order to maintain other businesses, a meeting was convened yesterday to find a solution, proposing to request that all foreign firms extend the delivery period of goods that have been ordered and are about to expire or have not yet expired by four months to clear them out, in order to facilitate turnover. A letter has already been sent for consultation. It is faintly heard that various foreign firms, for the sake of maintaining friendly trade relations, still have room for accommodation. If this is the case, the future of the sugar industry will have a ray of hope. The trading board showed that domestic Wu Fu ice was opened up to 6.9 qian, Huang Mao brand 6.8 qian, and Tong Shou goods 6.6 qian. The market sentiment was extremely excellent.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Oil Market: Asphalt Arrivals Are Scarce, Seeing Price Increases <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Last year, due to the late arrival of asphalt from the Jingyi area of Hubei, Shanghai merchants relied on the Zhejiang route. The mountain asphalt in Jinhua and Lanxi, Zhejiang, was not as abundant as in previous years. Moreover, the asphalt from Jiaxing, which is closest to Shanghai, was even more scarce. This led to the market showing new products and immediately rising in price. Shanghai merchants were fortunate to have the supply from Taizhou and Jiangxi, which barely sustained the supply during the three winter months. Since the beginning of spring, there has been no attention paid to the Zhejiang route, because Ezhou's annual output was abundant. There were no large shipments before the end of the year, but there were concerns about a flood of arrivals after the Lunar New Year. The shipments from Hankou arrived intermittently, but the foreign firms had already purchased them during the end of the year, so the arrivals were still insufficient. As a result, the Macheng Hong Pan immediately showed strength, opening at 12.8 taels and quickly rising to 13 taels, and recently to 13.2 taels. The famous Jing was at 13.4 taels, the Zhijiang Zhong Zhu also at 13.2 taels, the Ping Jing at 13 taels, and the Jinshi at 12.8 taels, all at the same price, already better than the Hong Pan by 4 qian. Moreover, due to the lack of supply, there were no stockpiles. Shanghai merchants had to wait for the goods to arrive, so the current oil in Shanghai was quite scarce, and the selling price was slightly higher.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: Recently, foreign exchange rates have been fluctuating unpredictably, and overseas silk telegrams to Shanghai have been few. Yesterday, only Xinfu imported 30 packages of Shangshen gray warp silk, and Samsung and others imported 25 packages of coarse yellow silk, and prices remained firm.</p>
<p>The spring silkworm rearing season has arrived. It is heard that there are inferior silkworm varieties being sold in the market near Wuxi.</p>
<p>A telegram from Hakodate states that the demand for salmon is weakening, and the market price has fallen by 0.25.</p>
<p>A telegram from Kobe states that the inventory of agar-agar in the production area is abundant, sales are poor, and prices have fallen to 12 to 13 yuan.</p>
<p>A telegram from Hankou states that the white tung oil route has turned around, and foreign firms have purchased 150 tons, at a price of 24.7 qian to 7 qian Shanghai standard.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Resolutions of the Municipal Representative Assembly on Party, Government, and Police Reports <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Resolution on the Party Affairs Report: Since the fifth session of the Executive and Supervisory Committee took office, the municipal party affairs have made significant progress in the past year in terms of party organization, propaganda, training, and spirit and form. Although various plans could not be fully implemented due to the constraints of the situation, the result of a year's efforts and struggles is that the party's organization has gradually become complete and solid from being scattered, and the party's command has gradually become unified from being divergent. Therefore, it can instruct each other and respond appropriately, clearing up the chaotic situation of the past and laying a solid foundation for the future. The General Assembly is satisfied with this. In the past year, in order to eliminate feudal forces and consolidate the revolutionary regime, the party vigorously advocated troop reduction and implemented demobilization plans, causing reactionary warlords to rebel one after another because they could not fulfill their desire for separatist self-interest. Zhang, Gui, Feng, and Tang rose one after another, the people's hearts were shaken, and the country was in turmoil. At this time, Shanghai was an important rear area, and all reactionary elements and remnants of feudalism wanted to rekindle their ashes and take the opportunity to make trouble. Crises were everywhere, and dangers were rampant. A little carelessness would lead to falling into the whirlpool of reaction. This can be seen from the changes in party headquarters in various places and the defection of comrades. However, our Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, in this situation of overflowing torrents, can not only stand firm in the rapids without shaking, but also unify its will, concentrate its strength, and engage in continuous combat with reactionary forces, destroying the enemies' rising flames and relieving the central government's worries. The decisions were made in an instant, and the success or failure was determined by one move. Without the fifth session of the Executive and Supervisory Committee comrades, who were deeply rooted, loyal, and well-led, how could we have achieved this? This is not only adding a valuable record to the history of the municipal party, but also the deep appreciation of the delegates. Although the municipal party's measures in the past year have made considerable progress, there are still shortcomings everywhere. To summarize the main points, there are only two aspects: first, the work policy cannot be completely determined; second, the work methods cannot be improved in accordance with the times. In terms of the first point, most of the past work was to deal with the immediate situation. Treating the symptoms in a hurry and adapting to the times has been the supreme means, but there has been no overall decision on the party's work policy and work objects. As a result, although the hearts and minds of thousands of people have been inspired in the past year, they have worked hard day and night, exhausting their energy in paperwork and running around. However, the effect has little impact on the future of revolution and construction, and even less on people's livelihood and society. For this reason, social organizations are still feudal organizations, and social systems are still feudal systems. On top of this kind of feudal organization and system, to seek the realization of the party's doctrine is tantamount to planting seedlings on rocky fields and hoping for a harvest. Everyone knows that it is impossible. In terms of the second point, the work methods of party departments at all levels in the city mostly only have the outline of form, and there is very little practical effectiveness. Following the old ways and sticking to the rules, if this continues unchanged, it will decline again and again, and will fall into a state of paralysis and stagnation and will not be able to recover. Without knowing that the times have moved forward and the real environment is different due to the times and places, the work methods should be improved in order to adapt, let alone say anything else. In summary, the General Assembly, in addition to complying with all the laws and resolutions of the central government, makes the following instructions on the improvement of work policies and work methods for the work of party departments at all levels in the future: A. Work policies: (1) In the future, the power of the organization, propaganda, and training departments should be concentrated on the reform of the social system, so that the new social foundation of democracy can be gradually established. Feudal forces arise from within social organizations, and social organizations are based on social systems. Therefore, to eliminate social feudal forces, efforts should be concentrated on the reform of the social system. The core of the social system is nothing more than economics, politics, and morality. Although the reform of this economic, political, and moral social system is a matter of legislation and administration, the party headquarters should always fulfill its responsibilities of revolution, supervision, guidance, and correction. Moreover, Shanghai is the center of culture, and every move is enough to affect the whole country. In the past, the party has made efforts in the political movement to abolish the lunar calendar, the moral movement to abolish prostitution, and the economic cooperative movement. However, the whole of the social system is very broad, and it is impossible to shake the foundation of the old system that has been gradually accumulated for three thousand years with only the efforts of this scale. As for the implementation plan, it still needs to be reviewed and finalized by those who come later based on this principle. (2) In the future, we should do our best to promote and expand the anti-imperialist movement and seek the final success of the revolution. The party has made considerable achievements in eliminating domestic warlords in the past, but has not made significant achievements in the anti-imperialist movement. Shanghai is the base camp of international imperialism. All the encroachment of concessions and legal rights, and the economic and political aggression are also concentrated in Shanghai. Not only do we personally witness it and feel extremely painful, but also the inability to develop industry and commerce and the day-to-day decline are also most influenced by the economic oppression of imperialism. Therefore, in the future, we should strengthen our strength, expand our scope, and engage in continuous hand-to-hand combat. (3) In terms of the people, we should devote our efforts to the training of the four rights and the promotion of local self-government, so as to cultivate the people's knowledge and ability to participate in politics and establish a practical foundation for political tutelage. The era has been flying towards the stage of political tutelage and is advancing rapidly. The training of the people's political knowledge and ability is in urgent need. The party's work should quickly adapt to the requirements of this environment without the need for further discussion. Therefore, in the future, we should make multi-faceted efforts in party member training, mass training, and propaganda movements, so that Shanghai will be the advocate for the whole country and promote the early completion of the political tutelage work. B. Work methods: Regarding the party's internal work, although all past plans were very detailed, in fact, they often failed to implement the proposals and achieve corresponding results. The General Assembly heard the reports of the various departments and extracted the main points to make the following instructions: Regarding organizational work, in the Municipal Party Headquarters, each department acts on its own and does not communicate with each other. The progress of all work is due to the vertical lines being too strict, so the horizontal relationship cannot be connected. The differences between each other are multiplied, and the economic inefficiency of time, manpower, and financial resources is the worst. In the district party headquarters, the executive and supervisory committee members mostly hold concurrent positions outside and cannot assume their responsibilities. Most of the work is entrusted to the staff, and the staff cannot be autonomous in everything, so they delay and delay, resulting in a desolate and desolate image of the district party headquarters organization. In addition, the allocation of funds is not completely in accordance with the central government's standards, so the activity funds are often insufficient to meet the urgent needs of the work. In the district branch, due to occupational reasons, they cannot devote themselves to the progress of the work. All the branches are empty for a long time, and it is difficult to deliver letters, let alone other things. The party member congresses mostly fail to reach a quorum, and the meeting is lackluster and ends hastily, which has become a common phenomenon. Therefore, in the future, attention should be paid to the following points and earnestly corrected: (1) The work of the various departments of the municipal and district party headquarters should be made to echo each other and closely connect, so as to make their relationship increasingly close and achieve the effect of different paths leading to the same goal. (2) Within the possible scope, try to increase the funds of the district party headquarters, allocate living expenses and activity funds in a similar way, and strictly restrict the concurrent positions of its members outside. (3) The division of the location of the district branch, the allocation of the number of party members, and the distribution of the duties of the executive committee of the district branch should be closely noted. In the future, the work should be frequently supervised. Regarding propaganda work: First, the propaganda plan, in addition to the revolutionary commemorative festivals and all ordinary work, has not yet been effectively and persistently implemented on the points that should be publicized during the political tutelage period. Second, the propaganda methods mostly follow the old examples of gathering the upper-class people in society and giving public speeches, but they cannot use the inherent centralized opportunities of mass organizations to conduct planned propaganda. Third, the research on propaganda skills and the cultivation of propaganda talents cannot be closely linked with the two departments of organization and training, so that greater achievements cannot be made. Therefore, in the future, attention should be paid to the following points for correction: (1) In addition to vigorously implementing the above-mentioned three principles, the propaganda plan should focus on the seven movements issued by the central government, such as literacy, hygiene, cooperation, and domestic goods, which are most suitable for the time and space needs of Shanghai, and should be implemented effectively and in a planned way according to their urgency and importance. (2) The research on propaganda skills and the cultivation of talents should be mutually connected with the two departments of organization and training to make multi-faceted efforts. (3) In the future, the propaganda methods should use the inherent centralized opportunities of mass organizations to assign specialists to give regular and long-term speeches. Regarding training work, the party member training in the past was only limited to the enlightenment of party doctrine theory, and the theory and practice were not mutually connected. Moreover, the cultivation of party members' personality and morality was not fully paid attention to. In terms of party doctrine education, it was only limited to the school level, and there was no corresponding guidance for all cultural institutions and academic groups. Therefore, in the future, attention should be paid to the correction of the following points: (1) Party member training should be integrated into practical work and be the cultivation of organizational talents, propaganda talents, and training talents. (2) In addition to party doctrine training, party members should also be given party ethics and party ideology education. (3) In addition to schools and boy scouts, party doctrine education should also pay attention to the investigation and guidance of cultural institutions and academic groups. Regarding civil training work, in the past, it only involved the consolidation of groups and the handling of disputes, and very few achievements were made in the actual work of civil training. Therefore, the theory and essence of civil training have not been generally understood by the public, and even the staff has not had an appropriate concept, resulting in more disputes and more difficult consolidation. In the future, we should earnestly pay attention to the correction of the following points: (1) The policy of civil training should be based on the laws and resolutions issued by the central government and consider the methods of implementation. (2) All labor-capital conflicts should be resolved on the premise of "safeguarding the common survival of the people and the interests of the whole society." (3) The training staff should correct the concept of work so that the people and the party can establish a relationship, and should not isolate them with individuals. (4) Vigorously implement the work policy in the preceding paragraph and use the inherent centralized opportunities of mass organizations to devote all efforts to the seven movements and conduct regular and long-term training. Regarding supervisory work, in the past year, the members have mostly been unable to attend as scheduled due to concurrent positions, resulting in all work being trapped in a state of stagnation and decline. The audit of the funds of party headquarters in various places, the investigation of staff, the review of the government's policy guidelines, and the impeachment of derelict officials are all within their responsibilities, but they have not been fully implemented. Therefore, in the future, attention should be paid to the correction of the following items: (1) Strictly restrict those who do not attend the committee meetings. (2) Strictly implement the discipline of the party and promptly report those members and staff of party headquarters at all levels who abandon their responsibilities. (3) Closely supervise the government's policy guidelines and promptly impeach derelict officials. The above is a summary of the past year's party affairs in the city as a resolution on principles and methods. The fundamental spirit of the General Assembly in this resolution is to point out the various defects that have occurred in the past and to indicate the path for improvement in the future, so that party affairs can gradually develop from perfunctory to daily, and from coping to construction, so that the party's doctrine can gradually transition from speech to the realm of realization. This is the ambition that we hope all comrades in the city will work together to strive for and implement.</p>
<p>The purpose of the municipal report resolution of the Fifth Municipal Representative Assembly is to make Shanghai a model for the first city to complete the political tutelage work. Therefore, it pays equal attention to the construction undertakings during the political tutelage period and the training of the people to exercise political power. In the past year, the Shanghai Special Municipal Government has indeed made considerable progress in the construction undertakings during the political tutelage period, especially in the plan for the central urban area. The General Assembly is satisfied with this point and hopes for its early realization. However, the municipal government has not yet started to carry out the training of the people to exercise political power by district. Since the central government has determined the political tutelage period to be six years, the local governments should make preparations. The Sixth Municipal Representative Assembly has to solemnly point out that the municipal government needs to start training the people to use the four powers as soon as possible. It is hoped that starting from this year, the municipal government will effectively divide the area to train the people in preparation for the implementation of lower-level local self-government. All comrades in the city should also guide the people to accept training and promote all work related to local self-government based on the resolution of the Third Plenary Session, so as to cultivate the social foundation of local self-government. Then the goal of Shanghai as a model city that first completes the political tutelage work will not be in vain. Even in terms of the construction undertakings during the political tutelage period, although the municipal government has annually determined the policy guidelines and has gradually made progress, it still lacks an overall plan and steps due to the uncertainty of the political tutelage period in the past. In the future, it must be based on the work that should be completed during the political tutelage period as indicated in the Outline of National Construction, and aim to complete it in six years. It must be based on its own situation, and its annual progress steps. In short, "achieving the completion of political tutelage in six years" should be our only slogan and the only effort for the month in the future. Under this slogan of achieving the completion of political tutelage in six years, the responsibilities that the party and the government of this city should assume should be in compliance with the regulations of the central government without the need for further discussion. What the General Assembly particularly pays attention to is not how the party and the government should each be responsible, but how to seek the effective cooperation between the party and the government. The General Assembly believes that the work between the party and the government must echo each other, and the party and the government should exchange reports on their work and plans with each other within a certain period, so as to understand each other's facilities and prevent the progress of the political tutelage work from being hindered by the slight separation between the party and the government. Moreover, the party headquarters at the same level has the right to supervise the policy guidelines of the government at the same level, which has been clearly stipulated by the central government. Therefore, the policy guidelines of the municipal government and the laws and regulations that affect the rights and interests of citizens should be reviewed by the municipal party headquarters in advance. After all, the correction and remedy after the event are not as perfect as the consideration before the event. Moreover, when the household registration has not been completely cleared and the four powers have not been fully trained, the municipal party headquarters should truly represent the citizens and assume the responsibility of supervising the municipal government under the party's political tutelage. Therefore, the municipal party headquarters should fully exercise the functions of the Special Municipality Council as stipulated in Chapter 4 of the Special Municipality Organization Law before the citizens' right to vote can be legally exercised. This is what is hoped of the next</p>
<p>The Municipal Executive and Supervisory Committee should not easily abandon its responsibilities. The completion of the political tutelage work first lies in the richness of finance. The municipal government has indeed made progress in the consolidation of finance in the past year, so the income has also gradually increased, which is beneficial to the construction undertakings without saying anything. What the General Assembly believes should be reformed immediately is that the budget should be based on the previous year's final accounts as a considerable basis, and the actual future income and expenditure must also be roughly in line with it. If the actual income and expenditure are still inevitably chaotic, then the budget and final accounts are only similar to the report, which will inevitably affect the progress of various undertakings. Secondly, the tax revenue must gradually change from indirect tax to direct tax, especially the land tax, which is considered necessary to start levying as soon as possible. Regarding the collection of land tax, the measurement should be completed quickly first, but at a minimum, the land price should be started in the areas with prosperous household registration, such as Shanghai South, Zhabei, Yinxiang, and Yangjing, and the land tax should be implemented. In this way, the municipal government's financial income can be increased, and at the same time, the miscellaneous taxes should be reduced as much as possible to benefit democracy. Among other things, the most related to land administration is the deed system. The actual measurement bureau has now been received by the land bureau, and the deed has already started to be consolidated. However, since the land bureau has the regulations for issuing the land report deeds, the land outside the original concession area should never be issued deeds in the future. Among the deeds issued in the past, there are many cases of Chinese people using foreign merchants' names. The land bureau should also carefully plan methods to remove their names and reduce their effectiveness, so as not to lose the purpose of safeguarding land rights. Transportation undertakings are the most important in the political tutelage work. At present, this undertaking is subordinate to the Engineering, Public Utility, and Port Affairs Bureaus, which seems inevitable to be divided into their own administrations. Although the opening of roads has been determined to have a five-year plan, other transportation undertakings are still in progress without a plan, or are only in a position of supervision and guidance and cannot assume their responsibilities. In the future, a whole development plan and steps for the city's transportation should be determined first, and the progress should be mutually compatible with each other. Public security undertakings should aim to eliminate the obstacles to construction and all reactionary forces during the political tutelage period. Therefore, public security personnel should have a deep understanding of the party's doctrine. In the past year, the Public Security Bureau has failed to fulfill its responsibility to the party to eliminate reaction and protect the revolution. Therefore, the General Assembly believes that the Public Security Bureau should strive to improve so that it is not only a bureau of the municipal government to maintain law and order, but also an armed protection under the party's rule. In other words, all the forces of the Public Security Bureau must be used as an assistant to the implementation of the party's policies. Secondly, the police of the Public Security Bureau must be divided into traffic police, health police, and political police, and each should be given the knowledge and skills of the assigned duties so that they can fulfill their duties. Social undertakings should aim to realize the social policies of the party's principle of people's livelihood. The phenomenon of social poverty is increasing day by day, and the responsibilities of the Social Affairs Bureau will inevitably be heavier. In the past year, limited to the extremely small proportion of funds, the Social Affairs Bureau is still in the position of research, guidance, and supervision. However, social policies that are beneficial to the poor, rural areas, and consumers have gradually started their work, and the charity undertakings have also started to be consolidated. Unfortunately, the charity organizations are still controlled by a small number of good sticks. Although there are one or two more sensible and impartial people, they cannot save it. The Social Affairs Bureau has not been able to vigorously implement the resolution of the Fifth Municipal Representative Assembly and fight against the local bullies. The General Assembly cannot but feel disappointed. Therefore, the General Assembly believes that the funds for social undertakings should be increased in the future so that there will be opportunities for considerable development. At the same time, the Social Affairs Bureau should be urged to hold a thorough disinfection work for the corrupt charity organizations with a fearless spirit. Health undertakings are extremely important to the health of citizens. In the past year, the Health Bureau has been working hard in school health and epidemic prevention. However, the unclean streets are still eye-catching, and the instructions to citizens on health knowledge are also insufficient. In the future, it should cooperate effectively with the party headquarters and carry out regular health movements as stipulated by the central government so that citizens know the importance and methods of health. Then everything related to health undertakings can be properly arranged. Education undertakings are extremely important to the training of the people to exercise political power. Although the city's education funds have increased today, its percentage has dropped from 25% to 19.77%, which has to arouse the serious attention of the General Assembly. With the majority of the city's school-age children out of school and the large number of adult illiterates, the education funds must maintain its ratio of 25% at least, and then we can expect the popularization of education. The General Assembly believes that the purpose of vigorously implementing the education of the Three Principles of the People is not only to instill the party's doctrine, but also to cultivate the backbone elements to save the decline of the nation. Therefore, school education must make students understand the position of the Chinese nation and the necessity of saving methods, the Three Principles of the People, cultivate their spirit of fighting for survival for the nation, and be able to fight for the nation's physical strength. All those who slightly involve the meaning of decadence and romance should be vigorously cleared up. Adult education should cooperate with the party headquarters in the future and make full efforts to eradicate illiteracy within the six-year period of political tutelage. In addition, such as the fact that education funds must not be misappropriated and the raising of education funds are the current important plans. The unification of the city's education rights is also considered necessary to be realized immediately. The realization of the central urban area plan should be an important task for us in the future. This work requires the government's strict plan and effective implementation, and especially requires close cooperation with the party. The General Assembly specially indicates that this plan is the real foundation for Shanghai to get rid of imperialist rule. Therefore, all comrades in the city must work together, cooperate with the government, and fight together to the end.</p>
<p>▲ Resolution on the Report of the Garrison Work: After listening to the report of the Songhu Garrison Command on the garrison work, the General Assembly knew that there was no negligence in the city's defense in the past year, the law and order was gradually consolidated, the intelligence could be valued, and the construction of military industry could also be carried out according to the opportunity. I feel satisfied. However, this city is the area where imperialism is the most rampant, and it is also the base camp for all reactionary elements to conspire to make trouble. The General Assembly deeply knows that the reactionary elements have not weakened their delusion of rebellion because they are attached to imperialism, and imperialism also uses the hands of reactionary elements to increase its means of bullying. In order to maintain the safety of the rear and consolidate the national foundation,</p>
<p>The resolution is as follows: (1) The city is vast, and the police force is slightly weak. In addition, all the rebellious people gather here. Without considerable troops, the occurrence of danger is inevitable. Therefore, the Fifth Division of the garrison in this city should be temporarily suspended from other transfers unless there is a special need. The garrison commander should also base on the importance of the defense zone to determine the deployment of soldiers throughout the city. (2) The number of reactionary elements hiding in this city is not small, but the number of good citizens is more than ten thousand times greater. If the good citizens can unite as one, no matter how cunning and cunning the reactionaries are, they will never be able to achieve their goals. Unfortunately, the citizens' knowledge is insufficient and the unity is weak. Therefore, in order to strictly prevent the conspiracy of the reactionaries to wantonly disrupt, the declaration of temporary martial law is not necessarily an appropriate measure. However, the implementation of martial law is often not announced, causing young children and weak women to sleep in the deep night. This point should be paid attention to. Moreover, after martial law, there must be a lifting of martial law, but only continuous martial law is heard, and there is no news of the lifting of martial law, causing the general public to be in a state of danger and fear every day. The commercial sector is particularly affected. In the future, for martial law, unless it is very urgent or contains a time limit, it should be announced in advance so that the public knows. The usual martial law should only be implemented for inspection and should be lifted by order on the day of the stability of the situation to reassure the public. (2) At this time of national crisis, the Communist Party has not been completely eliminated, and most of the reactionary factions have not disappeared. In addition, the bandits in the counties along the Yangtze River are rampant, and the people are in dire straits. The Garrison Command should prepare to completely eliminate all reactionary forces with most of its strength. Even if there are those who hide in the concession and are sheltered by imperialism, the Garrison Command should also properly deal with them so that they do not escape the net. The General Assembly is also very willing to provide strong assistance to the Garrison Command in this regard. (4) The most important part of the pacification work is the collection of intelligence. However, after the intelligence is collected, it should be immediately tracked down and the case should be solved. In the past, our party headquarters also cooperated in the intelligence work, but after the case was solved, it was found that some of the criminals were released on bail due to insufficient evidence, and some were allowed to roam free because the bailor was more powerful. The General Assembly sincerely hopes that the Garrison Command can deal with all the rebels who attempt to subvert the party and the country with the spirit of revolution and not tolerate them in the slightest, so that the comrades will not suffer great misfortune. (5) There has been no report from the Garrison Commander on the banning of newspapers and the inspection of mail related to the pacification. The General Assembly deeply knows that the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Headquarters has cooperated with the Garrison Command with the greatest efforts, and the results are considerable. However, this kind of ban is only a last resort, and the Garrison Commander should be asked to handle it with extreme caution. The General Assembly is also willing to urge the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Headquarters to pay attention to the efforts and assist with all their heart. (6) Due to military influences in the past year, the work of military industry and road construction has not been implemented. The General Assembly regrets this very much. The Prime Minister's military industry policy should be vigorously implemented by those who are currently in charge of military affairs. In the past, it was too urgent to defend, and there was no time to carry it out. In the future, attention should be paid to this. If it cannot be held due to insufficient funds, the General Assembly is very willing to arouse the public with the greatest efforts and assist with all their heart so that the work of road construction can be completed and the Prime Minister's instructions can be realized. (7) The construction of barracks is especially needed. It is not appropriate for the army to occupy civilian houses in terms of discipline, and it is not elegant in terms of appearance. Qian Dajun, the former commander of the Songhu Garrison, once raised huge sums of money from all parties, but nothing has been done. The General Assembly has not heard any reports from the current commander, which is really doubtful. The Garrison Command should be asked to investigate the case and urge its implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e102">American Minister Johnson Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>He Will Return to Beijing Next Wednesday</p>
<p>A Banquet Held by the American Chamber of Commerce Last Night</p>
<p>American Minister to China, Mr. Johnson, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning after traveling from Beiping to Beijing for negotiations on outstanding Sino-American issues. He had also attended banquets hosted by National Government Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Legislative Yuan President Hu Hanmin, and Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting during his two-week stay in Beijing. He is currently residing at the American Club and plans to stay in Shanghai for approximately one week before returning to Beijing next Wednesday to continue negotiations on the outstanding Sino-American issues. It is also reported that the Sino-American aviation contract will also be negotiated and revised by Minister Johnson.</p>
<p>Minister Johnson's Remarks: Our reporter visited Minister Johnson at the American Club yesterday, and the conversation was mainly about miscellaneous matters and did not touch upon diplomatic issues. Minister Johnson mentioned that his journey from Beiping to Beijing via the Blue Jinpu Train was peaceful. His time in Beijing was also calm and normal, but recent telegram exchanges have led to more rumors. There were reports of disruptions on the Jinpu Railway near Dezhou, but the actual situation is not as severe as reported. He is scheduled to return to Beijing on the 12th of this month. At this point, Mr. Deng Bi, the Second Secretary of the American Embassy who had accompanied the Minister on his trip south, entered the room. Minister Johnson introduced him to the reporter, stating that Mr. Deng Bi was born in Beiping, his father had served as the Consul-General in Shanghai, and his grandfather had been the Minister to China. Thus, three generations of his family have been in China, and under the principle of territoriality, Mr. Deng Bi is practically a Chinese person.</p>
<p>Banquet by the American Club: The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai had originally planned to host a banquet to welcome Minister Johnson upon his arrival in China at the beginning of February. However, the banquet was postponed because the Minister had to wait until he had formally presented his credentials to the National Government before accepting private banquets. The banquet was finally held last night at the American Club, attended by American expatriates. The attendees included Minister Johnson, Embassy Secretary Deng Bi, Consul-General Cunningham, Attorney General Pandi, Commander of the Yangtze River Fleet Craven, Director-General of the Municipal Council Fessenden, Princeton University Professor Gibbons, and President of St. John's University Bu Fangji, among over two hundred others. At the end of the banquet, American Chamber of Commerce President Raven delivered a welcoming speech, Consul-General Cunningham gave an introductory speech, and Minister Johnson delivered a brief thank-you speech, expressing his hope for sincere cooperation between China and the United States before the event concluded. The United China Association is also scheduled to host a public banquet this afternoon.</p>

<p>Separate "Expert Commissioners" Will Be Appointed for Discussion</p>
<p>The national new tariff schedule drafted by the Tariff Commission had been pre-approved by Foreign Minister Wang with various countries. However, due to the delay in the signing of the new treaty with Japan, it has not been formally announced to this day. Yesterday, it was learned that the detailed rules on reciprocal tariffs and commodity classification will be discussed by a meeting of expert commissioners separately appointed by various countries. Japan has decided to appoint Finance Official Komori Tairo as the expert commissioner to jointly negotiate with the Japanese Charge d'Affaires Shigemitsu Aoi. Once formally agreed, a protocol will be signed, and the new tariff schedule will be announced and implemented before the Sino-Japanese revision of the new treaty.</p>

<p>Issuing Money Instead of Grain</p>
<p>Recently, Shanghai County Magistrate Leng, due to the ever-increasing price of rice, making it difficult for people to afford food, it is urgent to provide relief. A special letter was sent to the Property Management Office to find ways to organize price stabilization of rice. After the office convened a meeting of district chiefs, it was unanimously agreed that purchasing and transporting rice to open price stabilization would not only involve complicated procedures but also be difficult to implement universally. It was decided to follow the methods of the Republic of China Year 9, issuing money instead of grain. Each district would investigate poor households within its jurisdiction and issue funds accordingly. The office has recorded the case and sent a letter to the county government for approval.</p>

<p>The section of the river channel downstream from the Wusongkou Yujidun has been poorly maintained for years and is severely silted up, causing vessels to run aground frequently. The Port Authority has been planning to dredge the channel, but fearing that this will not be enough to solve the problem quickly, it has formulated regulations for traffic and has consulted with the Public Security Bureau to set up a water patrol team stationed at Panlonggang Yujidun to provide immediate assistance. The proposed regulations and budget for the water patrol team have been approved by the municipal government. Currently, the ten articles of the regulations are being jointly issued by the Port Authority and the Public Security Bureau to ensure that vessels traveling in the area do not run aground again.</p>

<p>Highest Production Reaches 169 Jin Per Mu</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, recognizing that the cotton planting area in each district of this city accounts for more than 40%, and that the selection of varieties and cultivation methods are all conventional and unimproved, resulting in a year-by-year decline in cotton production, which is detrimental to the livelihood of citizens, initiated a cotton planting cooperative experiment last year. Seeds and fertilizers were provided by the Bureau, and a subsidy of five yuan per mu was also provided. The experiment was first conducted in six districts of the Lixing District of Pudong, and the results were satisfactory. The per-mu production of cooperative farmers in the district reached over 169 jin for Chen Zhuoyun and Hu Ansheng, and over 125 jin for Ji Langqing and Xu Guiting. It is now reported that the Bureau has approved the issuance of certificates of commendation to encourage them. The grading of awards is temporarily divided into three types: (1) those who harvest 100 jin or more of cotton per mu will be given a Class C certificate; (2) those who harvest 125 jin or more will be given a Class B certificate; (3) those who harvest 150 jin or more will be given a Class A certificate. In the future, if there is any special production, those who reach 200 jin or more per mu will be given a special certificate.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Commodity Inspection Bureau Encourages Silk Merchants <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the inspection of exported raw silk, silk merchants requested an extension because they needed time to prepare to adopt the public weight system. In order to consider the difficulties of merchants and maintain credibility, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce decided that the newly revised detailed rules would be implemented from March 1st, but the inspection of export quantities would be temporarily exempted until April 1st. The Bureau felt that although this issue has been resolved, it was deeply concerned that the silk merchants may still not understand the true facts and still have many doubts. Therefore, it sent separate letters to the silk factory associations and silk factories, explaining the situation in detail and inviting them to the Bureau to visit, study, and test the various inspections of raw silk, so that they can understand the facts and dispel their doubts. The original letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attached Original Letter: Respectfully, our Bureau is entrusted by the Ministry to handle inspection affairs. Its sole purpose is to assist merchants in improving commodities so that foreign trade will develop day by day. To achieve this goal, the strength of the government, the knowledge of scholars, and the experience of merchants must be combined into one. Therefore, for the establishment of each inspection office, specialized scholars must be invited as directors and technicians, and industry leaders must be invited as deputy directors and consultants. The hope of implementing government-merchant cooperation is that the intended goals can eventually be achieved. Last year, when preparing to establish the Raw Silk Inspection Office, the Bureau submitted a request to the Ministry to appoint industry leaders Huang Chen, Shen Huachen, Chen Haoquan, Cheng Bingruo, Wu Shenbo, Li Youren, and silk industry experts Miao Zhongxiu and Zhou Yanding as preparatory committee members. After the preparation was completed, Miao Zhongxiu was invited to be the director, Huang Chengzhi was invited to be the deputy director, and Lan En, Li Dizhong, and Guo Limao were invited to be technicians. All equipment, except for a portion accepted from the former International Raw Silk Inspection Institute, was purchased from Germany, Switzerland, the United States, and Japan at a cost of approximately 200,000 yuan, so that Chinese and foreign silk merchants can be satisfied at the time of opening. During the drafting of the detailed rules for raw silk inspection, a total of 14 preparatory committee meetings were held, and it was considered for a long period of ten months that the public weight system would not cause any losses to both parties in the transaction, and the trade behavior was the most fair. Japan had already implemented this system two years ago, and European silk-producing countries also use the public weight system for exported raw silk. The world trend has been consistent. Some may worry that the silk body will be damaged and the seller will suffer losses when taking public weight, but according to the many years of inspection experience of the former International Raw Silk Inspection Institute, taking public weight does not damage the silk body, and the over-dried strips or fictitious damages can still be used, so it was decided to adopt the public weight system to follow the trend and avoid falling behind. After the Ministry promulgated this system, it was originally scheduled to be implemented on February 1st. Later, your industry representatives requested an extension because the valuation of raw silk sales and purchases must also be reformed, and everything must be prepared, and the Ministry approved an extension of one month. Unexpectedly, after the expiration of the period, your industry representatives still stated that the procedures for public weight sales and purchases were not yet ready, and some silk merchants did not yet understand the advantages of the public weight system, and requested another extension. The Ministry believed that the business situation must be considered, but credibility should also be maintained, and repeated extensions were not appropriate. Therefore, it was decided that the newly revised detailed rules would still be implemented from March 1st, but the inspection of export quantities would be temporarily exempted until April 1st, and exemption certificates would be issued for export. Now that the issue of public weight inspection has been resolved, and all equipment in our Bureau's Raw Silk Inspection Office has been arranged, if you are willing to come to the Bureau for a practical visit and study of the various inspections of raw silk, please come to the Raw Silk Inspection Office between 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM every day from March 10th to March 20th. Our Bureau will order the staff of the office to put aside all matters and sincerely wait for your visit to explain everything. If you can bring silk samples to the Bureau for testing, so as to dispel all doubts with facts and jointly promote the progress of foreign trade in raw silk, it would be especially welcomed. I hereby inform you, and hope you will investigate. Best regards, Zou Bingwen, Director of Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, March 6th, 19th Year [of the Republic].</p>

Households with less than 5,000 yuan may still apply for an award if they can continue to raise funds and accumulate 5,000 yuan or more. A list of the awards has been drawn up, along with the plaques to be issued to the households that meet the criteria, and the forms for receiving the medals. These will be sent to you for verification and distribution. The instructions for receiving the awards have also been included to direct people where to go to exchange the medals for reward, etc. Two copies of the list, twelve plaques, twelve award certificates, and fifty-six forms for receiving awards were attached. In addition to replying to the letter and handling the matters separately, the plaques, award certificates, or forms for receiving awards issued by the department are sent with the letter, and I hope that you will check and reply, and exchange the original vouchers for the medals from the Ministry of Finance's Public Debt Department.</p>

<p>McNaughton Succeeds</p>
<p>Shanghai Times reported that the current Chairman of the Municipal Council, Arnold, submitted his resignation at yesterday's (5th) board meeting and retired on the same day. The meeting passed the resolution, and it was decided that before the new board members take office in mid-April, Deputy Chairman Major General McNaughton will temporarily serve as Chairman. It is said that Arnold's resignation was probably due to the results of this election. In addition to preparing the administrative report for the year, the old board of directors is required to prepare the budget for the coming year, which is submitted to the taxpayers' meeting for approval, and then implemented by the new board of directors. Arnold is the chairman, but he will not be on the board next time, and he feels that there are difficulties in fulfilling the duties of preparing the budget, so he resigned.</p>

<h3 id="e122">The All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association's Temporary Domestic Goods Market to Open <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association's temporary domestic goods market has been in preparation for many days. Yesterday, the tenth preparatory meeting was held, with 58 participating manufacturers. The opening ceremony is scheduled for 1:00 PM on the 8th. Resolutions were made regarding operating expenses, accommodation, and other matters. Many invitations have been sent to invite prominent figures from political, business, and academic circles to visit on that day. The association's declaration is recorded below: (Why are we launching this market? In short,)</p>
<p>We have two goals. First, it is to promote domestic goods. For every unit of domestic goods sold, one less unit of foreign goods will be bought. For every unit less of foreign goods bought, we reduce the outflow of Chinese money to foreign countries. These relationships are well known to everyone. Moreover, only by buying domestic goods can one appreciate their advantages and affordability. From then on, the word "domestic goods" will spread from one person to two, then to three, and be imprinted in everyone's minds. In this way, we will not fear foreign goods encroaching on the market for domestic goods. Our domestic goods factories will be easier to run. This is our first goal. The second is to provide relief to the disaster victims in Zhejiang. Because last year, Zhejiang Province suffered severe disasters. Taizhou need not be mentioned, but Huzhou, Shaoxing, and Ningbo also had many severely affected areas. We want to raise some funds for famine relief, so we came up with a method of selling "virtuous fruit tickets." On one hand, we are encouraging factories to donate goods, and we are using the donated goods as gifts for the virtuous fruit tickets. We want to take advantage of the launch of the domestic goods market to ask various manufacturers to donate some of their factory's products to help the numerous disaster victims in Zhejiang. This is our second goal. Because we have these two goals, this domestic goods market is being launched jointly by our All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association and five domestic goods organizations. Now, the venue for the market has been properly arranged (the Penglai Market in Xiaoximen, Nanshi). The opening date of the market has also been determined (March 8th). Fifty or sixty domestic goods manufacturers have joined the market and are preparing to open for business there. Come, come, come, everyone come! Citizens of Shanghai, everyone come and buy some domestic goods! Manufacturers of Shanghai, everyone come and promote some domestic goods, donate some domestic goods! Come, come, come, everyone come!)</p>

<h3 id="e126">The Ministry of Railways Investigates the Salary Robbery Case at the North Station <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of the 1st of this month at 10:00 AM, the case of the theft of more than 5,970 yuan in salaries at the North Station of the two railway bureaus has been reported in the newspapers. It is reported that the Ministry of Railways believes that since there are many military police at the North Station, it is suspicious that public funds were stolen. Furthermore, the circumstances of the robbery at the time were quite suspicious. Why was it known to the thieves that the cashier of the relief office, Liu Tongfu, had received the salaries? After the thieves left, why did the railway police not bravely pursue them? Therefore, it is believed that the police chiefs of the two railway bureaus and the head of the police affairs section of the railway bureau should bear considerable responsibility. Therefore, it was decided to send personnel to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the truth.</p>
<p>Also, Huang Renjie, the police chief of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway stationed at the South Station Police Office in the Shanghai-Jiading section, sent a letter yesterday to the Shanghai Special City Public Security Bureau, stating: "Regarding the matter of requesting assistance in apprehending [criminals], according to a telegram from Zhang Yunhui, a patrolman stationed at the North Station materials depot, on the morning of March 1st at around 10:00 AM, Liu Tongfu, the head of the dragon head office, took a tea room servant Shen Jiasheng on a pushcart to the Management Bureau's foreign relief office and received 5,880 yuan in salaries for the employees for February. They returned by pushcart. Just as they returned to the office in the dragon head room and were about to distribute the salaries, three short-clothed thieves, about 30 years old, speaking with a northern accent, each wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers, resembling workers, one with a shaved head and two wearing peaked caps, of medium height and strong build, suddenly rushed into the office, pulled out pistols, and intimidated everyone. They stole all 5,880 yuan of the February salaries and searched Liu Tongfu, the head of the office, taking a leather wallet containing more than 80 yuan in paper money. They forced him to open the safe. Because he was a little slow, a shot was fired, but fortunately, no one was injured. After the robbery, they escaped north towards Cao Mihang. Afterwards, workers Yin Maosheng and Shen Agou followed and chased after them and found more than 80 yuan in paper money in a ditch behind the coal platform. Please investigate and apprehend them. After investigation, the facts were confirmed. In addition to submitting a report for separate consultation and cooperation, it is appropriate to request that you investigate and find the stolen goods and thieves and bring them to justice."</p>
<h3 id="e127">The Two Married Daughters of the Sheng Family Also Sue for Division of Property <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Guan Yi and Yi Bu Follow in the Footsteps of Their Younger Sisters</p>
<p>Request that the Estate be Divided into Nine Shares</p>
<p>The result of the Sheng family's dispute over property was a victory for the two unmarried daughters, Ai Yi and Fang Yi. Now, their two married elder daughters, Guan Yi and Chang Yi, are also following in the footsteps of their younger sisters and have filed a lawsuit against En Yi, Chong Yi, Sheng Yi, Yu Chang, and Yu You for division of property. The reason for their lawsuit is that when they married, they only received a small amount of dowry and did not receive any inheritance. They also learned of the 181st resolution of the Central Executive Committee, which interpreted that women inheriting property should have equal inheritance rights as men, regardless of whether they are married or unmarried. They are requesting that Sheng Xuanhuai's estate be divided into nine shares. Yesterday afternoon, the Provisional Court summoned [the defendants], but none of them arrived. However, Sheng Yuchang and Yu You engaged lawyers Jiang Yiping and others to appear on their behalf and requested a postponement. The plaintiff's lawyer opposed [the request], and after mutual arguments, the presiding judge adjourned the hearing for seven days.</p>
<h3 id="e128">The Fang Danchi Estate Lawsuit Was Heard Yesterday <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Deng Guannan Falsely Accuses [The Plaintiff] of Restricting Freedom</p>
<p>Western Detective Appears in Court to Testify</p>
<p>Gold Leaves and Gold Pounds Were Not Given to the Concubine</p>
<p>The Coffin Shop Manager Will Be Called to Testify</p>
<p>After Fang Danchi retired from his position in Jiangxi Province, he lived in Shanghai until he died of illness on August 4th of the lunar calendar last year. All of his movable property, including bank deposits and goldware, had disappeared. His son, Da Can, believed that they had been stolen by his father's concubine, Deng, the concubine's father, Deng Guannan, and his father's friend, Wang Shutang, and servant Wang Dahan. Because he was in a hurry to return his father's coffin to his ancestral home in Huanggang, he did not resolve the matter legally at the time. Last year, the Deng father and daughter came to Shanghai from Wuhan, so Da Can went with Guannan to retain lawyer Zhan Jifeng to file a criminal complaint against Deng and others for joint theft in the Provisional Court. In the midst of issuing summonses, another incident occurred. Da Can still asked lawyer Zhan to continue to accuse the Deng father and daughter of falsely accusing him of kidnapping and damaging his reputation, while Deng also retained a lawyer to accuse Fang Da Can and his uncle Fang Fengchi of restricting her father Deng Guannan's freedom. After repeated summonses, out of consideration that Deng and others were living in Shanghai and had no way to find bail, it was ordered that lawyer Song Shixiang act as guarantor for Deng's parents, and lawyer Jiang Yiping act as guarantor for Wang Shutang, pending investigation. Yesterday afternoon, it was time for the continued hearing. Both sides came to court with their lawyers. At 4:00 PM, Judge Luo Renji finished hearing other cases from the Third Court and came to the Seventh Court to proceed with the hearing of the theft portion of this case. However, a certain Western detective from the Hongkou Police Station came to testify regarding Deng's false accusation, so he first ordered the Western detective to testify about the circumstances. According to him, after Deng made the report, he went to the Hongkou Grand Hotel to investigate and saw Deng Guannan, Fang Dacan, and a child in Room 19. The door of the room could be opened and closed at any time, and access was very free. Moreover, the room faced the road, and if Deng Guannan's freedom had indeed been restricted, he could have opened the glass window and shouted for help. He also submitted the police report of Deng's statement to the police station for inspection. Next, the plaintiff, Fang Da Can, stated that his father's deposits could be checked in the account book. When his father was ill, his uncles had asked about it, and his father initially did not expect to die from the illness, so he only told his uncles that there was an account to check. He did not know that the defendants had stolen the passbook and gold pounds and gold leaves after his father's death and destroyed the account books. Moreover, he did not know in what name the deposits were made or in which bank they were deposited, making it difficult to investigate. However, since the defendants had already admitted to the gold leaves and gold pounds, then the passbooks and other items were taken by them. Deng's statement that the gold leaves and gold pounds were given by her father was not true. Because his father and his uncles had not divided the property, the property belonged to everyone and would not be given away. He then submitted a distribution list and an account from Wang Shutang for inspection. His attorney, Zhan Jifeng, explained the reasons for submitting the two pieces of evidence, stating that the distribution list had Fang Danchi's own handwriting, which could be compared with the handwriting on the business card previously submitted by the plaintiff. He also proved that the words written on the back of the business card were indeed Danchi's handwriting. As for the account, it could also prove that the plaintiff's family had more than 3,000 yuan in early August of last year and did not need to use gold pounds as collateral to pay for the coffin. As for the 3,000 yuan, it was obtained by mortgaging tobacco leaf bills. Wang Shutang stated that the mortgage was made on August 12, which was also unbelievable. When questioned by Deng, she admitted that the checkbook had Danchi's own handwriting, but Wang Shutang said that the various payments were made on his behalf to repay debts. Judge Luo questioned, "Since the plaintiff's family needed funds for the funeral, they mortgaged the bill to urgently need the money. Then, they would not have the remaining money to repay old debts. Even if you wanted to repay the debts, the Fang family could take care of it themselves. Why would you repay them on their behalf?" Wang replied that there was a sum of 2,200 yuan that he guaranteed, so he repaid it on their behalf. Subsequently, the lawyer from the Ju Xiang Wood Company submitted two account books to prove that the coffin was purchased and paid for. He said that 36 gold pounds were initially used as a temporary deposit. On August 12, Wang brought cash to redeem the gold pounds. Lawyer Zhan immediately stated that according to Fang Fengchi's investigation with the wood company, there was no mention of gold pounds. If the company had any untruthful information, its manager could come to court to testify. Now, since he has not come, he should be ordered to come. Judge Luo immediately granted the request and waited for the summons to be served before the hearing continued. The account books were kept on file. The defendants Deng, Deng Guannan, and Wang Shutang were still guaranteed by lawyers Song and Jiang for bail.</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Local Court Heard the Counterfeit Banknote Case Yesterday <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Court Spent Three Days Inspecting [The Evidence]</p>
<p>A Total of 9,019 Counterfeit Banknotes Were Confiscated</p>
<p>The Judge Said the Defendants Had Done Great Harm</p>
<p>The Arguments Were Concluded Yesterday, Pending Sentencing</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Public Security Bureau cracked down on a counterfeit banknote manufacturing organization in the French Concession and detained six craftsmen who manufactured the counterfeit banknotes: Xu Yuting, Zhang Bingsheng, Zhu Yulin, Wang Jinshi, Chen Xiqing, and Wang Guoliang, who used the counterfeit banknotes. They were transferred to the Local Court, and after investigation, Wang Jinshi, Chen Xiqing, and others were also found to have committed opium offenses. Therefore, they were prosecuted with reference to Article 240, Paragraph 1, and Article 211 of the Criminal Law and the Anti-Smoking Law. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Shen Bingrong opened the court for hearing. According to the original detective Zhang Quanzhou, he saw Wang Guoliang holding a bunch of banknotes in front of Shouxian Lane. When he saw me, he quickly put the banknotes into his pocket, looking flustered. So, I followed him to his house, and the next morning, I arrested Wang Guoliang and found counterfeit banknotes in his galoshes on the spot. After taking him to the bureau, Wang confessed that the manufacturing organization was in the last house behind the cigarette company on Ximen Road in Ximen Lane. So, I immediately went to the address to arrest them. When I arrived, there was a mechanism on the door. When the bell rang, the lights inside went out immediately. So, we broke into the door and saw two engines and countless banknotes inside. The five people who were arrested were all wearing thin clothes and were working. A total of eight people were arrested, and three were released by the French Concession. When they were arrested, the main culprits, Chen Jinsheng and others, were smoking opium inside and later escaped. According to detective Wang Changlin, there were about four workers inside. According to detective Jiang Qiaosheng, when we went in, the order was already in chaos. There were four people in the engine room. According to the defendant Zhang Bingsheng, I am an apprentice doorkeeper. Xu Yuting said, I am a cook. The detective pointed out that he was arrested in the alley. The official said, after you finished cooking, your work was over, you must have helped with the manufacturing work. The official asked Zhu Yulin, are you working inside? Zhu claimed that the place was originally the Huaxin Art Company, and I am a proofreader. The judge asked whether you were proofreading the counterfeit banknotes. Moreover, you said at the company that you had a monthly salary of 30 yuan and a reward of 300 yuan. He replied, I did not say that. The official asked the detective, who is Zhu Jikun in the Public Security Bureau's records? He replied that he is a clerk. The director of the bureau himself reviewed the case. The official asked the defendant Chen Xiqing, and he replied that he was a typesetter, also denying it. The detective identified him as the one. Wang Jinshi said, I specialize in packing opium. Wang Guoliang said that he did not know Chen Jinsheng. His banknotes were given to him by a friend, Chen. The official asked whether Chen was Chen Jinsheng, and he replied, no. The judge said, this case is completely clear. How could you hire someone who is not a confidant as an accomplice and employ them? Moreover, your counterfeit banknotes are so real that only people in money houses can tell the difference. The court spent three days inspecting [the evidence] and confiscated a total of 9,019 banknotes, of which 415 were one-sided, and the rest were incomplete sets. You have done great harm. So, I asked prosecutor Lei to come to court and present his opinion, saying that the facts of the defendants' crimes in this case are already clear. However, the heaviest penalty for manufacturing counterfeit currency is life imprisonment, and the penalty for using counterfeit currency is also imprisonment for more than five years. I request that the presiding judge impose a heavy sentence. Wang Jinshi and others have also committed opium offenses, and I request that they be sentenced together. At this point, after defense lawyers Yan Yinwu and Ye Shengchao and others made their arguments separately, the judge announced that the arguments were concluded and that they would await sentencing. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<p>The Hearing is Scheduled for 2:00 PM Today</p>
<p>The lawsuit between the Dalun Company and the Laodafang shop and other tenants in Zhifuli, Nanjing Road, regarding the surrender of the lease has been appealed to the Shanghai Provisional Court of Appeal. The court held a hearing on February 12 and announced that the arguments were concluded and that the verdict would be announced on February 24. Subsequently, due to the intense dispute between the two parties regarding the custom of surrendering indefinite leases in the Shanghai business community, the landlord believed that in an indefinite lease relationship, it is only necessary to give one month's notice, regardless of the reason, and both parties can terminate the contract at any time, and there is no opposite custom. Therefore, if the landlord wants to take back the property for reconstruction, he only needs to give notice on time, and the tenant cannot object. On the tenant's side, the reasons for termination are only three: (1) The tenant owes rent for more than three months; (2) the landlord takes back the property for his own use, but this does not apply to city houses or residences built specifically for rent, but only to spare rooms for rent; (3) the house is burned or rebuilt due to disrepair, but after the rebuilding, the original tenant has the right of first refusal to lease, and the rent can be negotiated. This is a custom that has been practiced in the business community for many years. The two parties have different opinions. The court ordered on the 24th that the verdict be temporarily suspended and that the custom be investigated by official authority before reopening the debate and rescheduling the verdict. It is reported that the case will be re-examined at 2:00 PM today. All circles in Shanghai are paying close attention to it. The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association sent a public letter to the Court of Appeal, proving the custom of surrendering shop leases in Shanghai and requesting justice. The association's public letter is recorded below: "To whom it may concern, we received a letter from the Zhifuli Tenants Association on Nanjing Road, Fujian Road, stating that our members [omitted] are for both public and private convenience. Upon investigation, the statements in the letter are indeed facts. If this leasing custom is not confirmed and legal remedies are not provided, the impact will be incalculable. Based on the above, we hereby solemnly certify that the above-mentioned leasing custom is actually valid and request your court to provide legal remedies to maintain the social and economic order."</p>

Deng also counter-sued Deng Wenhai, Wu Hanzhou, and Wu Shutang in the same court. The case has been tried and concluded.

<p>Awaiting Scheduled Sentencing</p>
<p>Qu Chengqing, a local employee of the Tiensheng Foreign Firm, was kidnapped on the night of January 11th from outside the back door of his residence at No. 1160 Haining Road. The Hongkew police rescued him from the bandit den at No. 1548 Shenteli, Seward Road, apprehended fourteen male and female bandits, and confiscated firearms. Previous reports detailed the matter and their interrogations at the Provisional Court. Yesterday afternoon, the trial continued. Except for Jiang Fuquan, Zhang Tingchen, and Gu Ronggui, who were found to be uninvolved and released, the remaining suspects, Wang Yuqing, Zhang Zhangji, Wang Afu, Xu Asan, Shen Adi, Guan Kangsong, Wang Qiwang, Chen Shizhong, He Qingen, as well as the wives, Lou Zhu's wife and Gu Yang's wife, were brought to court by the police. Qu Chengqing, represented by attorney Jiang Rong, testified that Zhang Zhangji and Wang Qineng were both holding guns when he was kidnapped and when he boarded the car. They guarded him during the journey. Upon arrival at the bandit den, Wang Yuqing ordered him to write two letters, both addressed to his family, but the ransom amount was not specified. Wang Afu, Shen Adi, Guan Liansong, and Wang Qineng all took turns guarding him at the bandit den. Xu Asan was a tea servant in the den and occasionally helped guard the hostage. There were two pistols in the bandit den, and the leader was Commander Li. He had not seen the other defendants, nor had he seen He Qingen, and had not heard that he was the leader. He also stated that he had not seen the handcuffs presented as evidence in the den. Chinese and foreign detectives stated that they apprehended Zhang Li's wife at He's house on Wuzhou Road based on Xu Asan's confession that He Qingen was the leader. Witnesses Feng Zhaoxiang and Lou A'gen successively testified that the handcuffs were used in a previous theatrical performance and were later lost. After the lawyers began their arguments, Judge Xu ordered Chen Shizhong to remain under bail of one hundred yuan, while the remaining men and women were returned to custody pending a scheduled sentencing.</p>

<p>Although Nothing Was Stolen</p>
<p>It Was Still a Robbery</p>
<p>On the afternoon of January 26th this year, at the Lüzu Temple near the Quanzhang Guild Hall on Longhua Road, west of Gaochang Temple, two men dressed in police uniforms, along with two other men and one woman, suddenly burst in. The woman claimed to be visiting the temple to burn incense, while the two men claimed to be from an official organization and came to search for contraband. They opened and searched the bedroom of the temple's incense keeper, Shi Kangfu, but found nothing. They then seized the temple's abbess, the nun Xin Cheng, and demanded that she quickly open the inner room for them to search. The nun realized that they were not good people, because the temple had been robbed in the past year, and she had been stabbed in the leg by the robbers. Therefore, she was always wary. Seeing their actions, she was terrified and broke free, running outside and shouting for help. Soldiers from the nearby military unit heard the alarm and immediately gathered a number of soldiers to rush to the scene. They caught the group as they were fleeing the temple and took them into custody. It was determined that the men in uniform were named Ding Debiao and Chen Qingyu, and the two men were named Lou Zhuan and Wu Axiang, and Wu Hu's wife. They were transferred to the district court prosecutor for questioning. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Deng, together with Prosecutor Yang, opened the first court to hear the case. The defendants were brought to the court. The victim, the nun Xin Cheng, testified that she was fifty-eight years old, from Shanghai, and was in charge of the Lüzu Temple. There were no visiting monks in the temple, only an old man named Shi Kangfu who was employed as an incense keeper. Around 4:00 PM on the 27th day of the twelfth lunar month last year, policemen suddenly arrived, saying they were searching for opium. But we don't smoke opium, so how could we have opium? At the time, they first opened the incense keeper's bedroom to search, and then he (referring to Lou Zhuan) grabbed me and forced me to open my bedroom. I refused. At that time, she (referring to Wu Hu's wife) interjected, telling me to quickly open the door and let them see. I was terrified and ran out to call for help. Fortunately, the soldiers arrived and took them into custody. Please investigate. The official asked how much was lost. She replied that nothing was stolen. She thought they had seen her run out to call for help, so they did not dare to stay and search. The defendant Lou Zhuan testified that he was from Hangzhou, currently unemployed, and staying at his friend Wu Shuangxiang's house. The remaining testimonies were evasive. Wu Axiang testified that he was formerly a rickshaw puller, but now he was unemployed at home because he was blind. This time, he accompanied his wife, Wu Hu, to the temple to burn incense, and there was no robbery. Wu Hu's testimony was the same as her husband's. Ding Debiao and Chen Qingyu both testified that they were patrolmen in a certain district station and went to the temple with Lou Zhuan and others to search for contraband, which was true, but they did not report it to their superiors. They begged for leniency. Prosecutor Yang rose to state that Lou Zhuan and the others were guilty of robbery and requested that they be sentenced according to the law. The special attorney Hu Yuanjun defended the defendants, requesting the court to sentence them according to the crime of fraud. The presiding judge declared the arguments closed and ordered the defendants to be remanded to custody to await sentencing. The victim was dismissed.</p>

<p>Three Children Rescued</p>
<p>Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang, investigators from the Relief Society, discovered on the afternoon of the day before yesterday on the Taikoo Company's Taiyuan steamer bound for Amoy that a steward named Lin Bingsheng and a trafficker named Chen Wanlai had abducted several boys with the intention of taking them to Amoy to sell. Two children, Fang Xiaolin and Jin Zhenliu, were found in Lin's possession, and a child named Wang Fengqi was found in Chen's possession. They were taken to the water police station by the water police. Lin confessed that A'da had entrusted him to take the two children to Amoy and hand them over to Chen Wanlai for thirty dollars. Chen also confessed that his child, Wang Fengqi, was given to him by Gao Caixi. The trafficked child Fang Yonglin, fourteen years old, from Jinfaqiao, Chuansha, Pudong, whose father's name is Fang Taoxiang, and his mother's father is Zhang Yinchun, stated that he was an apprentice at a Linglong paper shop on Beiler Road, Ximen. The shop closed, so he came out and met a tea room worker from a theater at Potangnong Bridge, who took him to Nanyang Bridge, where he stayed for five or six days. Today, he was handed over to Lin Bingsheng. Jin Zhenliu, eleven years old, from Funing, living at No. 15 Yongzhili, Chang'an Road, whose father's name is Jin Jilin, who makes a living pushing a garbage cart, stated that he ran away from home after being beaten by his father, met someone at Garbage Bridge who took him in, and stayed for four or five days, then handed him over to Lin Bingsheng. Wang Fengqi, fifteen years old, from Zhenjiang, whose father's name is Wang Guozhen, is a farmer in his hometown, stated that he has an older sister named Da Letou, who has been married for five years, and he has heard that she runs a stone business at Garbage Bridge. He arrived in Shanghai on the 11th day of the first month on a Nisshin Company steamer. After disembarking, he met a young trafficker of similar age who took him to his home and locked him upstairs. Then Chen Hua came to take him away today. After verifying the confessions, the head detective Cheng Yongnian transferred the case to the district court for trial yesterday.</p>

They placed a paper package, disguised as silver dollars, on the window sill of the sweet potato stall designated by the bandit. Before long, the suspect</p>

<p>Jing arrived, took the package, and put it in his pocket. The detectives immediately stepped forward and arrested the suspect. He was immediately taken to the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the district court prosecutor's office for questioning. Initially, he was to be prosecuted under the Law for the Punishment of Bandits. Now, the procedure has been changed and he is being prosecuted under the new criminal law for the crime of intimidation. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Qian and Prosecutor Li specially opened the fifth court for a public hearing. The defendant, Jing Qiren, who was in custody, was brought to court. He denied everything, and his special attorney Zhou Yu defended him. The official declared the arguments closed and ordered him to be remanded to custody to await sentencing.</p>

<p>Bravely Pursue and Capture Three Robbers</p>
<p>The Tuan Police in Pusong Town (i.e., Beixinjing Town) in western Shanghai usually maintain strict security. Nearby villages also have defense teams to protect them, so there are rarely any robbery alarms in the area. The town's defense team suddenly received a report from a villager on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 6:00 PM that a large boat was docked on the Wusong River behind Taobin, about two li west of the town. People with suspicious appearances were continuously boarding the boat. There were about thirty people, and it seemed that they were waiting for more accomplices. Please send a team to investigate as soon as possible. After receiving the report, the Tuan Deputy Commander Hou Jilan and the adjutant Zai Yuankui immediately ordered the squad leader Ren Xudong, along with the first team members Li Youji, Gong Guanming, Li Qiusheng, Gao Yangyuan, Gu Youde, Cai Honggao, and others, a total of more than twenty people, to rush to the scene. By the time they arrived, the members of the Zhangjiangdu sub-defense station of the first team had heard the alarm and arrived first, and they had already opened fire. When the main force arrived, the robbers were still putting up stubborn resistance with guns. The sound of gunfire was continuous for a time. Seeing that they were outnumbered, the bandits began to swim away in an attempt to escape. The members of each team bravely crossed the river and pursued them, and finally captured three bandits and one pirate ship. Only a ship donation certificate, No. 3505, and the name of the shipowner, Ji Jinghua, were found inside the ship. At the same time, officers from the Public Security Bureau's water patrol team also arrived one after another and apprehended four policemen. The rest escaped in the dark night. The team immediately took the captured bandits to the team headquarters. According to their confession, one was named Lu Jinyu, one was Tang Yujiang, and one was Zhou Rishun. They did not deny the identities of the captured and escaped accomplices. The bandits captured by the Public Security Bureau gave cunning confessions that could only be handled in conjunction with this case. Therefore, they specially sent Officer Li to the defense team for repeated consultations to inquire about the case. The team was focused on maintaining local tranquility, so they agreed to the request and immediately handed over the captured bandits to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. They also reported the course of events to their superiors. The captured pirate ship was taken by the water patrol team for investigation and verification.</p>

<p>Glanders-Infected Live Horses Confiscated for Rendering Oil</p>
<p>Public slaughter and sale of horse meat is permitted in all countries. However, horses that are slaughtered and sold that have glanders are an incurable disease. There is a possibility of mutual infection between humans and animals. Those that have already been discovered are easy to detect. But those that are hidden cannot be seen with the naked eye. Recently, the Municipal Health Bureau, in order to take precautions against citizens' meat hygiene, has ordered each slaughterhouse that from now on, whenever there is a live horse slaughtered and sold, it must be tested using an injection method. If a horse is found to have a glanders reaction, it will be confiscated for rendering oil. Each horse, regardless of size, will be given a subsidy of ten silver dollars to compensate the owner's loss.</p>

<p>At 6:06 PM on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the Shanghai-Songjiang Railway's 66th down train traveling from Shanghai to Songjiang was approaching the west shed door of the Wusongzhen train station. An old man was crossing the tracks from south to north on Tongji Road. The train driver saw him and immediately blew the whistle to warn him. However, the old man seemed to be deaf to the warning. By then, the train was already close, and the driver applied the brakes urgently, but it was too late. The old man was crushed in two at the waist by the train wheels, and his head was also crushed. The scene was too horrible to bear. Afterwards,</p>

<p>Hu Huang's Wife Has Another Love</p>
<p>Hu Jianming, forty-one years old, from Yancheng, Jiangbei, living in the Nanmatou area, makes a living pulling a rickshaw. His wife, Huang, thirty-one years old, was worried that her husband's labor income was difficult to bear and that household expenses were not always met. So she went to work as a female worker in a certain hosiery factory, so that she could use her monthly salary to subsidize the household. However, she was a middle-aged woman with remaining charm, and she disliked her husband for being old and unable to provide a rich income. She often felt depressed in her heart. Recently, she entered into an inextricable relationship with someone named A, and they hit it off, completely forgetting about her husband. Although Hu had learned of his wife's secret behavior, he did not argue with her because of his reputation. His wife became bolder and bolder. A few days ago, she left home without permission and did not return for several days. Hu was anxious about his wife's disappearance and searched everywhere for her, but to no avail. It was not until around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon that she returned home. Hu questioned her sternly, asking where she had been staying for the past few days. Seeing that her husband was pressing her, she had no words to answer. Then, she became angry and retaliated, saying, "Am I not allowed to go out?" Hu was also furious and a big conflict arose between them. His wife took Hu to the first section of the first sub-bureau of the district and reported that she had disagreements with him (referring to Hu) and requested a divorce immediately. The director ordered a preliminary investigation and, because it was a matter of divorce, ordered him to prepare a document to be transferred to the Shanghai District Court for trial.</p>

<p>The Rickshaw Puller Was Panicked</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, east of Xinmin Road, Zhabei, there was a rickshaw with a concession license, carrying a man, about thirty years old, with a pale face, lying in the car. The rickshaw puller looked panicked and lingered on the road, looking worried. The police officer on duty there saw this and was suspicious, so he went forward to check. The man's body was as cold as ice, and he was dead. He questioned the rickshaw puller, who replied that he had been pulling the rickshaw on Beinicheng Bridge in the concession when someone asked him to take the man to the Jisheng Hospital in Zhabei for treatment. But before he could reach the hospital, the man had died on the way. I was carrying a dead person in my car, and I was panicked and didn't know where to go. I beg you to unload the corpse so that I can go back to work. I am very grateful. The officer on duty reported this to the Fourth District Headquarters, which ordered the local chief to report to the court for an inquest.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Three People Died on the Road <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>(1) Around 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, an unnamed male corpse, about thirty years old, wearing a blue cloth cotton robe and a copper basin hat, was lying in Dunmuli, Manzhou Road, Zhabei. The local chief reported this to the Wuzhen Road Police Station in the Fourth District. It was later found that the male corpse was named Wang Azhen, thirty-one years old, residing at Chen Mingfa's house at No. 9 in the lane. He was sent to the hospital for treatment by his brother Wang Baosheng because he was ill. Unfortunately, he was too ill to be saved and was rejected by the hospital. He was supposed to be taken home by car, but he died halfway. The second landlord, Chen Mingfa, considered it unlucky to have a dead person in the house, so he did not allow the corpse to be carried into the house and had no choice but to abandon the corpse in the lane. Yesterday morning, the court sent someone to conduct an inquest, and it was confirmed that the death was due to illness. The corpse's family members were ordered to prepare a coffin for burial. (2) Jiang Yongsheng, forty years old, from Changshu, was previously a cook on the Xia Jiulang silk screen boat. Recently, he suffered from epilepsy and was dismissed by the shipowner. He went to Shanghai Hospital in the South of Shanghai for treatment, but never recovered. Recently, his finances ran out, so he slept on the streets at night. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, he was walking to the west of the Gongji Bamboo Shop on the Outer Ma Road when he suddenly fell to the ground due to an attack of his illness and died soon after. Zhou Lansheng, the local security chief, arrived at the scene to search. In his pocket, there was only a medical bill from Shanghai Hospital and nothing else of value. Since no family members could be found, he immediately reported to the yamen to receive a coffin for the inquest.</p>
<p>(3) Xu Desheng, forty-two years old, from Suzhou, an employee of the Dai Pig Rendering Oil Factory in Tanjia Bang, Wusong Outer Ma Road, left home around 8:00 AM yesterday morning to go to the factory to work. However, he suddenly fell to the ground at the intersection of Wenchang Road, talking nonsense. A few minutes later, he lost consciousness, foaming at the mouth. Passersby tried to send Xu to the hospital for treatment, but he only had a breath left. It is said that there is no hope of recovery.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Three Months Imprisonment for Bigamy <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The woman Jin Yao, hired a lawyer in the Provisional Court to file a criminal complaint against her husband, Jin Guangfa, for bigamy, abandonment, and abuse. Because Jin failed to appear in response to the summons, the court issued a warrant to arrest Jin and the key witness Zhao Zhizun. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Yuan continued the trial in the Second Criminal Court. The plaintiff, Jin Yao, stated that her husband, Jin Guangfa, used to work at the Tianyi Printing House. In July of last year, Jin became acquainted with a woman. A gangster found out and started blackmailing him, causing Jin not to go to the company for two days and his business to be suspended at this time. Later, I pleaded with the company to reinstate him, but all the salary was collected by me. Until one day, I learned that my husband and the mistress held a formal wedding ceremony at the Hongxiang Hotel on Xinzha Road. I rushed to the hotel at 3:30 PM, but they were already married. When I went to negotiate, my husband escaped through the back door, but I caught up with him and took him to the police station. The police chief ordered me to file a lawsuit with the court. That's why I filed the complaint. The defendant, Jin Guangfa, firmly denied bigamy. Judge Sun asked why the Hongxiang Hotel's book stated that it was a joyous event for the Jin family and had a wedding hall. Jin replied that it was also possible that someone with the same surname got married that day. Zhao Zhizun also denied being a matchmaker. Judge Sun verified the report and ordered the lawyers of both parties to argue.</p>
<p>The court sentenced Jin Guangfa to three months imprisonment for the crime of bigamy. The number of days of pre-trial detention was to be counted as two days for one day of imprisonment. The accompanying civil lawsuit dismissed Zhao Zhizun as innocent.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM, a cargo truck, city license No. 3662, was carrying more than forty barrels of tung oil from Yangshupu to the South Station to be transferred to Fuxing Transportation Company for transport to Hangzhou.

The trams traveling south from Ximen, such as the fourth, third, and second road trams, were all blocked. Later, the truck's workers tried to move the tung oil to the side of the road, and then used manpower to push the truck off the tram tracks. At the same time, a rescue machine was dispatched to tow the damaged cargo truck for repairs. The tram traffic was blocked for about half an hour before it resumed.</p>

<p>The liquidator of Tang Jisheng's debts, accountant Pan Zhaobang, filed a petition with the French court yesterday stating that Tang Jisheng had previously mortgaged the property deeds of the Jinde, Risheng, Rihui, and Hezhong lanes to the Jukangxiang Money Shop for a total of 300,000 taels of silver. To this day, they have not been redeemed because Tang is unable to arrange it. It should be requested that the court order the Jukangxiang Money Shop to submit the mortgaged deeds to the court for sale, or appraise the value and sell it to the mortgagee, so that the remaining funds can be distributed to the various creditors. The Jukang Money Shop, represented by attorney Wang Fuchang, stated that Tang Jisheng had mortgaged this property to our client many years ago and had renewed it several times. The principal and interest are estimated to be over 400,000 taels. The liquidator's request to submit the deeds to the court for sale is strongly opposed by our lawyer. As for the mortgaging the property to the mortgagee, I don't know if this property can cover the debts, our client is unwilling to buy this property. Judge Chen said that he would wait for further verification.</p>

<p>To the editor: I recently read an article in your newspaper's local news section on March 1 regarding the Qing Tian surveying ship clerk Li Mengzu drowning in the river. Some of the facts are incorrect. On that day, I went to the Hydrographic Survey Bureau on official business to discuss documents. Anxious to return to the ship, I hastily boarded a ferry, lost my footing, and fell into the water. Fortunately, I was rescued and there was no other reason. Fearing that distant rumors would be inaccurate, I am writing to request that your editor correct the record to reflect the facts. Sincerely, Li Mengzu</p>
<p>To the editor: I recently read a report in your newspaper's local news section on March 6 titled "Pudong Middle School Teacher Writes Absurd Slogan." Upon careful examination, I was shocked.

<p>(4) In the Theater</p>
<p>Apart from movie theaters, there are about twelve or thirteen theaters in Shanghai that specialize in stage plays, including the Peking opera sections of various entertainment venues. Each theater has seating ranging from a few hundred to one or two thousand, so the number of audience members absorbed by various theaters each night is quite considerable when tallied up. The layout of Chinese old-style theaters has indeed improved compared to the past. There are many places that have been improved in terms of stage, background, seating, and decoration. Even teapots and towels seem to be much whiter, but the red and green colors in the eyes and the shouting and noise in the ears still maintain their original spirit.</p>
<p>The theater is a place of entertainment. The audience members certainly didn't run to the theater to deposit their bodies (temporarily) for a few hours because they had nowhere to put them. When we go to the theater to listen to a play, we at least want visual and auditory pleasure and physical and mental comfort. But in a big city like Shanghai, what are our impressions of general theaters? From the moment you enter the door until you leave the door, your eyes, ears, nose, throat, hands, feet, in short, your limbs and bodies, must be protected by the tense air around you.</p>
<p>We will not talk about the problem of reserved seats in the theater, because there are many problems that cannot be explained at once. Let's just talk about a spectator who wants physical and mental entertainment. What is the expression on his face in the theater? For example, if someone goes to the theater, when the usher sees him before he even steps in the door, he greets him as if he knows him and leads him in. However, he usually asks the guest first if he has a reserved seat or says ("Is this one ticket?"). The above is an exception if the guest has already reserved a seat.</p>
<p>After entering the venue, the guest will definitely choose a direction where he can hear clearly and see carefully. However, the result is ("Sir, I'm sorry, this place has already been reserved."). So the expression on the spectator's face is a little unnatural. If the theater is doing too well, then the expression on this spectator's face will be especially ugly. Sometimes the usher leads the guest around the venue to the east and to the west. The spectator's face is sometimes calm and sometimes tense, like a person walking with a bailiff in a temporary court. One can imagine what his face and heart are like.</p>
<p>Eventually, a seat is found. The usher has already taken great pains, but the guest is still very wronged. Especially if there are many people, there are always a few inevitable disputes. If the focus of the dispute involves ticket prices or money, then the rows of spectators who are not connected will be felt uncomfortable. Unless you reserve a box seat, which can be relatively comfortable, there are always some places in any hall or building that make people frown. The most annoying thing is that everyone is not acquainted, and at one point, inexplicably has to ("stand up to greet and send off."). For example, if there are sixteen seats in a row and five or six at both ends are already occupied, only four or five in the middle are left. If someone enters the seat, the people sitting at both ends will have to stand up to let him in. Letting in three people requires letting them in three times, which is not considered annoying. The most helpless thing is that if your noble neighbor gets up to pee, then you have to stand up twice in three minutes to send him off and greet him. As for whether your noble neighbor only has one bowel movement in a long period of four or five hours is another question.</p>
<p>Because when arranging seats in the theater, they are saving land like transplanting rice in a paddy field. The seats in each row are squeezed as much as possible. Not to mention fat people, who have to shout ("Excuse me") when going in and out. Even people with smaller statures dropping their hats or knocking over teapots is not a rare trick when going in and out. As for the rows of seats in front and behind, each seat is in a straight line with the one in front and behind it. If the audience members sit upright, then dozens of heads will become a vertical line. The audience members sitting downstairs often lean their shoulders and peek between the heads of the two people in front. However, the direction of the stage is far, and the location of the heads is near. The audience members behind look through the heads of the audience members in front, making it as difficult as looking at white clouds between two mountain peaks.</p>
<p>The colors and sounds in the theater are used to the extreme. The bright lights and the bright red and green colors shine on the eyes, often causing sleepiness. The sounds on the stage go without saying, are the price of the guests' money. The deafening gongs and drums are still echoing around the ears even after leaving the theater, but the source of the sounds offstage is difficult to explain. The most common are the cries of children, the coughing of gentlemen, the shouts of vendors selling candied haws, and the various sounds of teahouse waiters calling customers and the calls between them.</p>
<p>Move your gaze from watching the play to the walls, which are covered with many advertisements, almost like an enlarged newspaper. Especially for something like strong..., avoid..., menstrual..., plum..., tonic..., cough..., etc. The morbid state of the city is clearly performed on the walls, while the stage is still playing out a play from the fifteenth century. Once, a theater was playing ("New Changban Slope"). Mrs. Mi's arms holding Liu Adou was a Western doll, with fat white hands and feet, golden hair, and a pair of azure eyes. A child under the stage clapped and shouted "Western doll" non-stop. I don't know why, I had a thought, as if saying, "(Little Liu is of Slavic descent.)"</p>

<p>Last Friday, on Yidingpan Road in western Shanghai, under the dim lights, a long-haired man, wearing a half-long, half-short coat, walked shivering. He looked around restlessly, as if afraid of being seen. After walking less than two hundred yards, he was met by a group of patrol officers. He was so frightened that he lowered his head and desperately walked forward. His panicked attitude proved that he had done something illegal and aroused the suspicion of the patrol officers, who shouted to stop him, ("Where are you running?").</p>
<p>("I...I...I'm going home."), he replied in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>"Are you wearing a serge robe? Is there a pattern?"</p>
<p>"No, it's satin, with flowers."</p>
<p>"How much money do you have in your purse?"</p>
<p>"I have tens of dollars."</p>
<p>"Hey, come here and look at the light... Oh, it turns out it's serge, where are the flowers... You're not a good thing, search him..." "Ahem, only twelve dollars. Where did this money come from?" Huge palms were sent to his face one after another.</p>
<p>"This...this was stolen from a certain female school," he replied, unable to bear the pain.</p>
<p>A group of patrol officers rushed to the certain female school and knocked on the door to investigate. It turned out that the male teacher's dormitory had been robbed. The window of Mr. Lu's room was half open.</p>
<p>"Hey, open the door, the detective wants to go in and investigate," they shouted like this.</p>
<p>"What's wrong in the middle of the night?" Someone in the room asked.</p>
<p>"I'm a detective, have you lost anything?"</p>
<p>"No, don't make noise, do you understand the rules? You can't knock on the door in the middle of the night."</p>
<p>"I was originally like this, what are the rules, I don't understand."</p>
<p>"I'll teach you now, you can't make noise in the middle of the night, that's the rule... Don't act like a teacher, I'll help you catch the thief, open the door quickly."</p>
<p>Mr. Lu had no choice but to get up and open the door. Under the light, he found that the leather suitcase placed on the bedside had been opened at some point. The newly purchased serge leather robe had disappeared without a trace.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Dongbao Reports on the Decline of the Chinese Flour Industry <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Flour Industry is Very Optimistic</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>According to Dongbao, Japan's flour exports to China are expected to suddenly flourish soon. Due to a shortage of funds, many Chinese flour mills have stopped operating, causing a sudden lack of flour supply in the Chinese market. Tianjin currently has 1.1 million bags in stock, Dalian has 1.8 million bags, and Shanghai has 600,000 bags, most of which are flour from Canada and other countries. Chinese-made flour is almost completely sold out. In the past two years, the situation of the Chinese flour industry has been poor, and several large factories in Shanghai are now shut down, resulting in an increasing shortage of goods. Japanese flour traders are therefore quite optimistic about trade with China and expect to receive a large number of orders soon.</p>

<p>Exceeds 1 Billion Marks</p>
<p>Two Million Unemployed</p>
<p>Berlin dispatch: Since the settlement of the reparations issue under the Young Plan in June of last year, Germany has repeatedly sought to rationalize its industries. However, due to a lack of funds, progress has been difficult. There have been many unemployed people during the winter. Last summer, there were about one million unemployed in the country. Late January statistics show that the figure has exceeded two million, setting an unprecedented record. Since the end of last year, capital from various countries has flowed in, especially American investment plans, which have been implemented one after another. The investments already decided by various countries include a loan of 500 million marks from Sweden, with the German government essentially granting the Swedish Match Company a monopoly on match sales for the next fifty years as collateral. Additionally, Germany's two major electrical companies, AEG and Siemens, have each borrowed 100 million marks and 30 million marks from the American General Electric Company. Furthermore, the world's only large chemical dye industry trust, I.G. Farben, has accepted Ford's huge investment. Opel Automobile Company is under the influence of American General Motors through investment. By this summer, investments from various countries will exceed 1 billion marks. Although there are signs of recovery in domestic industries due to the influx of capital from various countries, the encroachment of foreign capital and the monopoly of domestic industries by various countries have drawn criticism from informed individuals, but there is nothing they can do.</p>

<p>▲ Drastic Decrease in Imports to the UK</p>
<p>Since the development of radio broadcasting, people in various European and American countries have been eagerly installing radios and listening to various types of music, which is extremely convenient. The once-popular phonograph has seen a sudden decrease in purchasers. Taking the UK as an example, according to statistics released by the Ministry of Commerce on phonograph imports to the UK over the past twenty years, the import volume in 1913 before the war was 25,000 units. Subsequently, it decreased year by year, and by 1928, it was less than 100 units. There was a slight increase last year (1929). The table is as follows:</p>
<p>1910: 18,802 units, £557,922</p>
<p>1928: 75 units, £58,800</p>
<p>1929: 1,415 units, £93,338</p>

<p>Whether rayon can be used for papermaking is a question in the industrial world. According to recent experiments by the U.S. Bureau of Standards, it has been determined that it is not suitable for papermaking. This is because after rayon comes into contact with water, its fibers easily break and lack the toughness of rags and cotton. After forming a thin sheet, it cannot withstand the pressure and baking procedures, so it cannot be used for papermaking.</p>

<p>Three days later, the body was washed by the tide and finally washed into a crevice of rocks on a beach of a deserted island. Therefore, his body was silently exposed there for two days. However, his ghost finally found the local Malay chieftain in a dream.</p>
<p>(Hey, chieftain, bury my remains.) The ghost said to the Malay chieftain.</p>
<p>(Who are you? Where are your remains?) The Malay chieftain's dream soul replied.</p>
<p>(I am a Tang person. I came south with Lord Zheng He. I unfortunately died halfway, so they threw me into the sea for a sea burial. But I was washed here by the tide. My body has been wedged in the rock crevice on the beach and exposed for two days.)</p>
<p>(Oh, so that's the matter. But I can't agree to your request for me to do this, and I'm not happy to do such a dirty thing.)</p>
<p>(Ah, you're not happy and won't agree? I advise you to just do it and get it over with. Otherwise, in three days, the body will probably rot. At that time, your Malays might have an epidemic.)</p>
<p>(That doesn't matter, because you are a Tang person and we are Muslims who don't eat pork. Even if I don't bury your body, the Heavenly Emperor won't punish us. Besides, you are a Tang person who eats pork and rebelled against the Heavenly Emperor.)</p>
<p>(Alright, suit yourself. But I told you my good intentions, and you don't believe me, I can't make you believe me. Wait and see. Goodbye.) The ghost said, and disappeared.</p>
<p>When the chieftain woke up, he thought it was just a nightmare, so he didn't care about it.</p>
<p>Three days passed, and the deserted island began to have an epidemic. The Malay chieftain remembered his nightmare at this time. But many of his soldiers and civilians had already died. He couldn't think of any way to do it. He had no choice but to leave it to fate.</p>
<p>One day, it was June 30th, Zheng He's eunuch arrived at this deserted island in the South Seas. The Malay chieftain happily welcomed him because he wanted to get a method to avoid the epidemic from Zheng He's eunuch. He saw that none of the twenty or thirty thousand soldiers and civilians that Zheng He's eunuch brought were infected with this disease. So, he began to ask Zheng He's eunuch to give him guidance.</p>
<p>(You should bury his body.) Zheng He's eunuch only said this to him.</p>
<p>Later, the chieftain obeyed and did it. Sure enough, in two days, none of the natives on this deserted island were suffering from this disease. Since then, the natives of this deserted island have also built a temple for the deceased and offered incense to him. It is said that the deceased at that time was the Bodhisattva that the overseas Chinese in Nanyang now call (Tua Pek Kong). As for what place this deserted island is, it is said to be what is now the Dutch-owned Semarang.</p>

<p>The New York Aeronautical Engineering Society has recently undertaken a great project. When this project is completed in the future, it will definitely make New York City even more noble and prosperous, and it can release a myriad of rays of light for New York's aviation industry. That is a great project, the greatest project in aviation history. Outside New York City, there are now countless low-lying grasslands, which cannot only be used for farming, but even animal husbandry is impossible. It is truly a barren land. The New York Aeronautical Engineering Society indeed has a brilliant idea. It will use this unproductive wetland to make an airfield. No matter how poor the place is, whether it is low or wet, regardless of what difficulties and inconveniences there are in terms of engineering, this wetland is suppressed and overcome by human power. This human power is like this: the river mud dug out from the bottom of the river is used to fill and raise this low-lying grassland.</p>
<p>The airfield mentioned above is the Secaucus Airfield, which is currently under construction. The site is a large open low-lying area in Jersey, New York, three and a half miles from downtown New York City. The airfield occupies more than a thousand acres of wetlands. It has now been thickened with river mud. The mud is dug out from the bottom of the Hackensack River. It will take about five million cubic yards of river mud. The river mud that has been dug out is 2.5 million cubic yards. It is said that 25,000 to 30,000 cubic yards of river mud can be dug out in 24 hours every day. The equipment of the airfield is also very impressive. The airfield is equipped with an aircraft showroom, offices, storage warehouses, a parking field, and a hotel for tourists to stay in. In the future, when this airfield is completed, New York's aviation industry will definitely advance even faster, needless to say.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Changxi on the Total Amount of Public Business in the United States Last Year <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Among the world's great powers, the finances of the United States, which prides itself on its wealth, are worthy of our attention. According to a recent report by Schwarzchild, editor of the American Insurance Magazine, on public enterprises in 1929, there has been great progress and surpluses. The total operating revenue of public enterprises in 1928 was $562,228,200. Last year, it increased by more than $400 million compared with 1928, and the total amount was $626,290,006. This total amount is based on the reports of fifteen of the most active banking businesses in the country. First is the Hallgarten &amp; Co., a bank that also operates enterprises. Last year, the business in enterprises was $307,065,800. The business with shared profits was $470,566,000. The second is the National City Bank's exclusive business of enterprises, which was $262,580,000. The shared profits increased almost double compared to Hallgarten &amp; Co. In short, the increase in business and the sharp increase in surpluses of these fifteen banks, according to observations in the economic field, are all due to the development of foreign trade in the United States, and the Far East is a major reason for its sharp increase. Furthermore, last year, the total amount of statistics for various businesses in the country was $626,290,006, and the automobiles and accessories related to trade with China were $44,880,000, machinery $111,869,400, radios and accessories $29,840,500, railway materials $29,528,600, rubber $63,200,000, sports equipment and ordnance $10,075,000, cigarettes $4,143,000, industrial and factory-made sundries $96,512,000, and the turnover of kerosene reached $376,090,000. Although it cannot be entirely regarded as exploitation from China, it can be inferred that China is the largest sales market for American foreign trade.</p>
