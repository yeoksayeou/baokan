<p>討論第一組覆審查報告由汪漢滔報告如下本組奉大會交下覆審查案五件（第十七案第二十七案第三十五案第三十六案第四十案）當經開會討論茲將各案審查結果開列于後當否仍候公决</p>
<p>第十七案改進工商業大綱案提案者張子廉審查結果本案第一條第一項用意甚佳惟保管方法及進行手續尙須請政府酌量核辦第二項國府業已頒布條例惟基金保管方法似應有一定籌募方案方可議及第三項能否實行請工商部查核第四項用意極佳其第二條各項亦具有見地後開策略六項除第一項外餘均擬請大會通過原則送請工商部分别探擇</p>
<p>第二十七案取締外人在華企業以抵制經濟侵</p>
<p>略案提案者朱彬元審查結果本案所擬提各節極關重要惟辦法第一項廢止兩字似應改爲限制第五項外人在華經營公用事業應有國人</p>
<p>參加管理或監督一節仍應改爲從速收回由國人經營之其餘各項辦法似均妥善擬請大會通過送請政府採擇</p>
<p>再第五第十四第三十一第七十五第八十七共計五案原係歸併本案審查本案如荷大會通過</p>
<p>請政府採擇</p>
<p>第三十五案請確立保護方策以維東北基本工業案提案人處廣續審查結果東北因受外人經濟侵略較内地情形特别嚴重而大豆小麥又均佔出口重要地位應由政府規定特别經濟政策對于各種基本工業切實保護原案送請工商部儘量採擇</p>
<p>第三十六案限制商店門面不許陳列洋貨案提案者陳兆棟審查結果本案在現時社會狀况之下仍爲事實上不可能惟儘茲外貨充斥之際提案人亦頗具苦衷如果全國工商自動團結一致進行將來亦未始不可辦到擬請送工商部存備參考</p>
<p>第四十條　各業應規呈經主營官署核准者同業應一體遵守案提案者上海社會局審查結果請工商部轉送司法院解釋（以上均通過）</p>
<p>通過核准業規同業遵行案</p>
<h3 id="c123">潘公展王延松王雲五王介安竭力主張 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>原則通過請工商部採納施行</p>
<p>次討論同業公會案各會員討論情形如下</p>
<p>由汪漢滔報告審查結果王延松認第四十案滬市社會局提出之各業規呈經主管官署核准者未入公會之同業應一律遵行案關係重要應請原提議人說明理由</p>
<p>潘公展謂無論加入同業公會與否對業規不能有所歧異否則入公會者雖一律遵守而不入公會者可隨意變更同業旣受影響而官署核准反不生效殊非工商之福同業公議之業規行規可以補法律之不足可維護商業之進行如每日洋厘由錢業公會議决後全市各業一體遵行决無壟斷之弊如業規不能一致勢必公會解體滬總商會以各業公會爲基本公會不能維持則總商會勢難孤立社會局認此業規關係之重要故提出此案請衆討論</p>
<p>田金波謂各地業規不同如内地同業每有　公會以壓迫小本經營者此案應考慮</p>
<p>王延松謂同業公會之組織所有執委等均由同業公推公正人員担任决無自已壓迫自已之事可勿多慮</p>
<p>穆藕初報告工商部前接滬百餘同業公會及社會局之呈請備案會與主管司迭經商量覺業規確係事實但與法律有所抵觸故加批駁</p>
<p>王延松謂滬商會常依據各業習惯法以辦理商業糾紛案種種經過並未有抵觸法律之處滬上百餘同業行規維持委員會此次委託本人代表本人責任重大又黨行規之重要已如潘會員</p>

<p>中外航空互相競運</p>
<p>本年長江航業因受時局影響進出口貨均皆不振迨至近日因贛省積貨可裝致上游下水貨已在大批趕運中連日滬上各江輪對長江營業競爭至烈亟將所知分紀如下</p>
<p>太古公司英商太古公司在長江内船舶最多噸位亦最巨向來上下水生意占六公司之首今年該公司之長江營業不若以前之佳本街貨尤缺幸南北洋船之轉口貨較多然在營業上已退居日船之後矣據稱自二月以降收支不能相抵幸公積巨大無損毫末該公司之目光乃轉入上游始以安慶大通鄱陽各船展長路線至宜昌繼又添建油機新船無湖武穴專放滬宜同時又將上江運率減短生意稍爲起色　日上水各輪漢口班不如宜昌船平均各船出口去貨不過三四千件耳</p>
<p>日淸公司日淸公司本爲專營長煤航路者近掁南北洋增外海船後轉口貨亦已不少今年各江輪均淸衰獨該社之出口貨猶能保持六七成　脚水脚最好之紗布運往長江占六公司中第一位近更進而分奪怡和專運之捲烟故各船去貨常較他船爲夥對於客家回佣遷就備至給扣而外又有送禮等事因之營業優於他家刻下每週有長江六船宜昌一班涸日因上游貨可以開裝在漢贛皖載有大批菜子麥皮棉子等貨轉運往東洋者該社之長江進出口在今年業已躍居第一位矣</p>
<p>怡和洋行怡和江輪今年亦甚淸衰惟每週</p>

<p>一次之宜昌船去貨尙佳故添造之新船實和輪本月内可以開行矣近日出口貨不若下水貨爲多每週祇開五班銀行現欵與大批煤油均歸其獨裝在長江線内之野鷄班輪明生號已經售出矣</p>
<p>招商輪局招商局之長江生意本年因停輪輟班過多在營業上大受打擊惟在本星期内已可陸續放回至下週起準右恢復正班各輪近頃該局之出口貨大有突飛猛進之勢每逢一四班大船水脚恒在萬兩左右即昨日開行之江裕小船亦收七千餘兩現方在整理伊始苟能全部後業則當可超勝日英各輪蓋大通安慶等埠該局有專運之權外輪不能競爭也</p>
<p>三北公司三北公司今年長江船亦全停航至本月始有新寗興廣興鴻元鴻亨等船行駛之今新造之七百噸鴻字二輪不久亦可開行近日因上游之沙市九江各地積貨已在開始裝滬該公司以船舶不敷分調特電令上江之鐵駁亦放行滬漢承載下水貨件矣</p>
<p>寗紹肇興寗紹公司刻仍派老寗紹一船行駛其新購之寗靜輪以出租在外一時未能調航也肇興公司之長江船現在肇興榮興二輪惟沿途僅靠蕪潯兩處故所裝之去貨不過糖鐵而已又無轉口營業似難興他家抗衡也</p>

<p>( ) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Ma Fuxiang on the 5th, saying that the General had shown him special favor and entrusted him with full authority to handle military affairs in Hebei. He was worried day and night that he would not be able to repay the General's special trust. He humbly requested the General to provide further instructions and guidance from afar.

<h3 id="e3">Declaring Retirement to Farming <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Yan Xishan's telegram of retirement to farming arrived in Tianjin on the morning of the 5th. The text stated: "Xishan recently issued a book entitled 'Declaration of Retirement to Farming to My Fellow Citizens,' which briefly states that since the beginning of the war, battlefields have been reduced to ruins and the rear has faced heavy supply burdens, causing me deep sorrow every time I think of it. Now that the withdrawal of troops has resulted in half the losses in Hebei, it is impossible to achieve our goals by continuing the war. Having repeatedly received orders urging me to return to farming, the Commander-in-Chief does not wish to further devastate the local area and cause suffering to the people by using force. Therefore, I am handing over the administration of the provinces of Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai to the respective provincial governments and the military forces to the respective provincial garrison commanders for reorganization and conclusion to ensure their proper aftermath. The Commander-in-Chief will immediately retire to farming to fulfill his father's wishes. As for the pacification and rehabilitation of the military and the people, it will be the responsibility of the parties concerned. May all my fellow citizens bear witness." Yan Xishan's Seal. (6th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yan's telegram of retirement on the 4th is a clever tactic. The so-called retirement to farming means he is unwilling to leave Shanxi. (6th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yan appointed Sun Chu as the Garrison Commander of the Lu'an Border Defense Zone on the 4th, with Yang Xiaoou and Yang Yaofang as his deputies. (6th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Ma Fuxiang told a reporter from the Central News Agency on the 6th about the recent situation in Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, saying that Feng's troops stationed in Gansu imposed harsh taxes and levies, causing resentment among the people of Gansu. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible for Feng's troops to stay in Gansu. Currently, the bandits and soldiers in Gansu are complex and all pretend to oppose Feng. In reality, Feng's troops only have a small part stationed in Lanzhou under Lei Zhongtian, about twenty people, who have also expressed their sincerity. The rest are a mixed bag. The Central Government has its own perfect methods to deal with the situation. Ma Qi in Qinghai sent someone to Beijing yesterday with a letter reporting his support for the Central Government and the process of expelling Feng's forces and bandits and maintaining local order in recent months. He has united the Han and Hui elders and fellow soldiers of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai to pacify the local area and await the Central Government's disposition. (6th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e11">Issue of Transporting Antiquities to Beijing <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) There is a misunderstanding here about moving all the antiquities to Beijing. Fukkaisen said that there is no need to display too many of the same antiquities currently on display. The remaining ones are kept in boxes, which is not worth displaying in Beiping. In addition to the originals, the duplicates can be transported to Beijing for display. It is also possible to set up branches in other cities so that the Chinese people can all see them. The items that the National Government plans to transport to Beijing refer to the duplicated items and do not mean that the antiquities of the Forbidden City will be transported south. Now, the General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed Chiang to oppose the removal of antiquities to Beijing, but they probably do not know the original letter and the original intention.

<h3 id="e12">Tax Reduction for Tianjin Tobacco Merchants <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The British American Tobacco Company has resumed the original tax rate and started operations. More than sixty Chinese tobacco merchants cannot enjoy the tax reduction treatment. Each family sent a representative to the Unified Tax Bureau to petition, and the General Chamber of Commerce petitioned the Municipal Government. Mayor Zang Qifang asked the Provincial Chairman Wang Shuchang for instructions. He could not make a decision. After persisting until evening, Zhang Xueliang's reply telegram arrived in Tianjin, approving the tax reduction for Chinese tobacco merchants. It was decided to issue Chinese tobacco tax tickets first and ship the goods first to make adjustments. Three days later, British tobacco tax tickets will be issued. (6th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e13">The Japanese Merchants' Plan to Invade the Chinese Market <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Since the global industrial and commercial depression, industrial countries have been sending personnel to China under the guise of sightseeing or inspection. The purpose is to promote commerce and absorb capital, acting as vanguards for the invasion of the Chinese market. Japan, due to various conveniences, harbors an even greater ambition. According to Western newspapers citing Tokyo news, Japanese exporters recently intend to compete with Chinese-style factories, planning to set up factories in Shanghai and Qingdao to manufacture goods exclusively for sale in China. The rubber shoe and aluminum industries all have such plans, and many others are following suit. The textile industry is even planning to unite and expand its factories in China. Setting up factories in China can avoid heavy taxes and utilize cheap labor to produce large quantities of goods, using Chinese labor and Chinese land to compete with the Chinese people. The Chinese factories' talent and strength are not as great as the Japanese, and their art is not as refined. The outcome of the competition is already clear. Moreover, the foreign trade of Chinese merchants has plummeted and cannot be developed. The so-called revitalization of domestic goods is only a plan to sell them domestically, preserve the Chinese market to resist foreign goods, and operate small industries to try to recover meager profits. If Japanese merchants implement their plans and various industries set up factories in China, then the small Chinese industries will also be plundered and destroyed by them. This is by no means a trivial issue. If Japan comes to compete with Chinese merchants, and other countries follow suit to compete with Japanese merchants, can China's fledgling industry withstand this heavy pressure and multi-faceted encirclement? If Chinese people want to preserve this dilapidated business and maintain the livelihoods of tens of millions of workers, how will they manage in the future?</p>

<p>Taiwanese Aborigines Fight Bravely in a Counterattack</p>
<p>Twelve Japanese Soldiers Killed in Action</p>
<p>Hanaoka Ichiro Dismissed</p>
<p>Dentsu, Kirsha, 6th: The First Battalion of the Second Regiment, dispatched from Tainan, consisting of three platoons, is advancing towards the southeastern highlands of the Mahebo Aborigine Village to block the retreating path of the aborigines who initiated the uprising into the deep mountains. Although trapped, the aborigines continue to fight to the death. Around 11:00 AM yesterday, they launched a fierce counterattack. Despite being supported by artillery units near Taruwan, the Tainan battalion suffered casualties due to the unfavorable terrain. Twelve soldiers were killed, eleven were injured, and three are missing. A temporary ceasefire was called at 2:00 PM today. Refusing to yield, around 4:00 PM, fifteen or sixteen aborigines attacked the Japanese battalion headquarters’ kitchen within the Mahebo Village. The defending troops immediately responded and repelled them. The aborigines are currently planning a counterattack and are confronting the Japanese troops.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 6th: According to a public telegram received by the Colonial Affairs Ministry, Captain Annam of the Third Platoon appears to have been killed in action during the battle on the southeastern highlands of the Mahebo Village.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 6th: According to a telegram received by the Colonial Affairs Ministry, Hanaoka Ichiro, the aborigine police officer who was the leader of this aborigine uprising, has been dismissed from his post.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Puli, 6th: One theory regarding the cause of the Taiwanese aborigine uprising is that the wages for carrying were reduced to half while they were being severely exploited. However, an inspection of the accounts in the silver box of the Noko District Office's Sub-Office revealed thumbprint receipts from the aborigines.</p>
<p>Irrelevant.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Puli, 5th: The punitive force killed fourteen rebellious aborigines in the Taroawa Valley, further shrinking the area where the rebellious aborigines are hiding. Due to the unexpected rapid pursuit by the punitive force, the rebellious aborigines have no time to transport and hide food supplies, and therefore burned the food and retreated. However, the hiding place only has twenty days' worth of food. They are planning a counterattack.</p>
<p>The General Election of Austria is Approaching</p>
<h3 id="e57">The Political Situation Suddenly Becomes Serious <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The Social Democratic Party Conspires to Launch an Uprising</p>
<p>The Government Implements a Major Search</p>
<p>Kuomin, Vienna, 5th: The Austrian general election is scheduled for next Sunday. Today, the government suddenly searched the entire country's Social Democratic Party's offices and seized 4,000 rifles, 150 pistols, 20 machine guns, 160 hand grenades, 400,000 rounds of ammunition, several wireless generators, and numerous field telephones. It is strange that although the right-wing organizations in Austria also have sophisticated weaponry, the Austrian government has not searched them. According to sources close to the Ministry of Interior, the department members sent messages in advance, so the party secretly moved the arms, so only a small part was seized. The members who leaked secrets would be punished and dismissed. It is also said that during the search of the party organs and the homes of famous party members, it has been discovered that they are secretly colluding with the military and police to plot an uprising, including the instructions for the uprising, but the opposition party claims that this is a deliberate fabrication by the authorities to take advantage of the election to suppress republican groups. It is now reported that the reactionary interior minister is planning to order the dissolution of the Defense Alliance, which is closely related to the Social Democratic Party, in the near future. In addition, the military police officers who are affiliated with the Republican parties have been dismissed and replaced by reactionary elements. Even though most newspapers, especially the Republican newspapers, are under strict scrutiny by the party, they still openly publish shocking news, pointing out that Premier Vogue and Interior Minister Prince Stahmberg are determined to organize a strong-arm party reactionary government, regardless of the election results. From all these indications, the Austrian political situation can be considered extremely serious.</p>

<p>Dutch General Lawton Presides</p>
<p>The Russian Representative Will Have Heated Debates</p>
<p>Kuomin, Geneva, 6th: The Preparatory Committee for Disarmament began its meeting here at noon today. To prevent excessive actions by the representatives of Soviet Russia and Italy, the military and police were extremely strict. The Chairman of the Committee is Dutch General Lawton. After the meeting began, Lawton first declared the proceedings of the meeting, prohibiting anyone from making sound films. Lawton then briefly reported on the past work of the Committee and warned the attendees not to have excessive expectations. It is expected that under the current circumstances, the Committee can achieve some practical achievements in disarmament, and that full disarmament is only an ideal at present. This meeting is only the first step to achieving this beautiful ideal. It is understood that the conference will be held until mid-December. It is expected that when the head representative of the Soviet Union, Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov, speaks to attack the great powers' hesitation in disarmament, there will be a violent disturbance. According to the Soviet personnel, Li is determined not to use gentle words to please and will strongly criticize the capitalist powers. In addition, there is another major point of contention, namely the issue of naval equality between France and Italy. According to the American representative, Mr. Bruce, he believes that the two countries will be able to reach mutual understanding and reach an agreement, but the French and Italian people do not think so. Most of the representatives from various countries who attended this time were the members who attended the first meeting, except for the Foreign Minister. Only Mr. Litvinov has arrived. Seven Foreign Ministers will arrive tomorrow. The Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia still needs a few days to arrive here.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 5th: Swiss patriotic groups held a general meeting and were strongly opposed to the Russian representative's attendance at the Disarmament Preparatory Committee. The police were on high alert at the station when the Russian representative arrived, and no incidents occurred.</p>

<p>May Trigger a Political Upheaval</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: During yesterday's House of Commons vote on the unemployment issue, Liberal Party members voted inconsistently. Simon and Hutchison, and five others voted against the government, while Simmons and four others voted in favor of the government. The Liberal Party's inconsistent steps may trigger a political upheaval. Liberal Party members' opinions on supporting the Labour Party government have long been divided, and this has only now become apparent. It is rumored that Sir Hutchison intends to switch to the Conservative Party and has announced his resignation from the Liberal Party leadership because he did not follow the party's decision not to vote last night. At the same time, Sir Simon's letter to George, sent ten days ago, has also been published, pointing out that the Labour Party government has failed and distrusts the government's intention to amend commercial disputes, and claiming that he will vote against the government no matter what. The government has agreed to proceed with the amendment of the Commercial Enforcement Act during this parliamentary term, and Sir Simon's letter has raised questions about the government's future. It is also heard that the Labour Party has decided to prepare a special fund to prepare for a sudden political upheaval that will trigger a general election.</p>
<p>U.S. Congressional Control</p>
<h3 id="e61">Will Fall into the Hands of the Democratic Party <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 5th: Which party will control the two houses in this election is still a question today. Based on the current vote count results, it is impossible to grasp the trend. It is a fact that the number of votes for the Democratic Party is surprisingly high, but it is still difficult to determine whether it can win a majority of seats in both houses. As of now, the election vote counts for senators are as follows: Republican Party, eleven; Farmer-Labor Party, fourteen. The majority of votes for governor were won by the Democratic Party. The Republicans won four. According to observers, one thing to note is that the Republicans elected this time are mostly practical independent-minded people.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 5th: The Democratic Party claimed today that control of the two parties has fallen into the hands of their party, while Republican personnel are quite anxious. However, neither party's vote count exceeded the majority limit. Regarding the Senate race, the Republican Party has won 47 seats, but the Democratic Party is only one seat away from 48 seats. The result in Kentucky is not yet certain because it is far away and we have to wait until tomorrow for accurate news.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 5th: According to the phenomenon, the Democratic Party seems to have an advantage in both houses. Recent reports indicate that the Democratic and Republican parties each occupy 47 seats in the Senate, and the Farmer-Labor Party occupies one seat. The result in Connecticut is not yet known and seems to be leaning towards the Democratic Party. In the House of Representatives, the Democratic Party occupies 209 seats, the Republican Party occupies 205 seats, and the Farmer-Labor Party occupies one seat. The results of the other ten seats are not yet known.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 4th: The Republican Party has not encountered such a tragic defeat in nearly 30 years as it has this time. The New York Times, a non-partisan newspaper, stated that the Democratic Party's great victory this time was due to the public's dissatisfaction with the Hoover government's failure to cope with unemployment and commercial depression, and that Prohibition and the new tax laws were also the reasons for the Republican Party's setback. In the thirty-two states holding gubernatorial elections, the Democratic Party won sixteen seats and the Republican Party won eleven seats. Anti-Prohibition advocates won eighteen seats in the Senate and one hundred thirty-five seats in the House of Representatives. National Prohibition advocates are very happy about this result. Although they cannot have an overwhelming faction, their position is far better than four years ago when all members of Congress thought that opposing Prohibition was tantamount to suicide.</p>

<p>Associated Press, Millfield, 5th: After an explosion in the Millfield coal mine here today, about 150 miners were trapped in the mine. It is difficult to predict whether these people will see the light of day again. The number of deaths and injuries cannot be determined until the rescue team excavates to the tunnel. Several miners have escaped with only minor injuries. Several mine managers were inspecting the mine when the explosion occurred, so they also perished. Now Red Cross personnel from all over are rushing to the scene to do their best to rescue. A follow-up report reveals that the company's general manager, Teths, and six other employees and several foreign guests who entered the mine for inspection unfortunately happened to be there and were all killed. As of now, a total of seventy bodies have been unearthed.</p>
<p>Japanese Hokuriku Line Train Derailment</p>
<p>Near Oyashirazu</p>
<p>Twenty-Five People Killed and Injured</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 6th: At 1:40 AM this morning, the express train No. 23, consisting of second and third class cars, traveling from Osaka to Aomori, derailed at a location 1,000 meters from the Ichiburi Station on the Hokuriku Line during its journey. (The locomotive suddenly derailed, one passenger car fell off a 30-foot cliff, one was stranded in the middle of the cliff, and five were spared. The engineer died on the spot, and the assistant was seriously injured. One passenger, a two-year-old child, died.) Three people were seriously injured and nineteen were slightly injured. The rescue team rushed to the scene to perform surgery on the injured and provide travel expenses to other passengers. At the same time, the cause of the disaster was investigated. However, the location is a dangerous place near "Oyashirazu." The track is laid on a 30-foot cliff, but there are no sharp bends or major curves, and there are no other reasons for the derailment. The cause of the derailment is completely unknown. It may have been caused by small stones falling on the line.</p>
<p>Japanese United News, Tokyo, 6th: According to a public telegram received by the railway authorities, the train derailment at Oyashirazu was a planned act by a thief.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 6th: The cause of the train derailment accident at "Oyashirazu" is under investigation. The cause of the derailment was that four bolts were removed from the connection point of the track 45 meters to the left of Naoetsu, and three of the four bolts and three of the four large nails were also removed. A crowbar was left at the scene, which was stolen from the railway maintenance hut on the night of the 5th. It has been determined that this was a planned conspiracy to overturn the train. The suspect is currently being arrested.</p>

<p>Belgian Army Budget Reduced</p>
<h3 id="e65">But Military Spending Increased <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Guomin, Brussels, 5th: The Belgian army budget for the coming year is 120.5 million Belgian francs, a decrease of 46 million Belgian francs compared to this year. However, the decrease in this item is actually due to the devaluation of Belgian food prices. In fact, military spending is still 22 million more than this year.</p>

<p>October 15, Rome Newsletter: Italian Princess Giovanna (the second daughter of the Italian King) and King Boris III of Bulgaria will hold a Catholic wedding on October 25 in Assisi, Italy. After returning to the country, they will choose another day to hold a Greek Orthodox wedding in Sofia (the capital of Bulgaria). The Italian princess believes in Catholicism, and the Bulgarian king believes in Greek Orthodoxy. The Bulgarian constitution states that the Bulgarian king must believe in Greek Orthodoxy. In order to harmonize the two countries' religions, these two procedures must be followed. However, some people say that this marriage is entirely political and not romantic, because Italy wants to develop its power in the Balkans.</p>

<p>The Central Propaganda Department hosted more than 20 journalists from various places at 6:00 AM on the 6th. Liu Luyin, the chairman, reported that the Central Standing Committee had resolved to stop censoring the news, hoping that the press would not take its responsibility lightly because of the lack of censorship. The government's failure to censor the news is to return the responsibility of speech to the press, which is to increase the burden of the press. I hope that the press will pay attention to the interests of the country and society when recording news or publishing opinions in the future, and will also be politically and morally responsible. It also said that the National Industry and Commerce Conference is about to close. The purpose of the government to convene this conference is to seek to build the economic foundation of the country and to understand the reasons for the economic downturn of industry and commerce. The results of the meeting show that the obstacles to the economic downturn of Chinese industry and commerce are excessive taxes and miscellaneous taxes, coupled with poor financial conditions and the manipulation and aggression of the great powers in the economy. In the future, the government will do its best to eliminate these obstacles. The government and the people will work together to achieve the goal of revitalizing industry and commerce. If the press has any opinions, they can be contributed to the government. The meeting was adjourned after the report.</p>
<p>The Process of Unifying the Jinpu Railway Administration</p>
<h3 id="e72">The Pingpu Railway Has Been Opened as Scheduled <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since February of this year, Yan Xishan appointed Liu Encheng as the director of the Jinpu Railway Bureau in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, and received the Tianjin office of the Jinpu Railway Bureau, which was changed to the Jinpu Railway Bureau, and detained the vehicles. The north-south transportation has been interrupted for seven or eight months. The losses of the railway bureau are not enough to be counted, and the losses suffered by the general merchants and people are even more numerous. When the Northeast Army entered the customs to take over the defense of Pingjin, all Jin organs were taken over, but the Tianjin Jinpu Railway Bureau was not assigned anyone to take over because of its small scale. The Jinpu General Bureau then sent Zhu Luyun, the deputy director of the bureau, to Tianjin to take over. Liu Encheng, who was appointed by Jin, had already handed over the seals and files to Zhu. Qu Yucan, the deputy director, suddenly returned to the bureau on the second day after the handover, with Zhang Xueliang's telegram appointing him as the acting director of the Jinpu Bureau, forcing Zhu to hand over the received items again. Fearing that this would cause misunderstandings in the Northeast, Zhu withdrew from the bureau, and Qu became the director in one fell swoop. However, most of the vehicles in this section were taken away by the Jin army. Although military transportation has ended, passenger transportation cannot be restored. At that time, the Second Brigade of the Northeast Army had opened to Dezhou and Cangzhou to deploy defenses, and it was necessary to maintain traffic. They then borrowed a locomotive and several passenger cars from Beining Road and handed them over to Qu to open the Jin-De section. At the same time, the northward traffic of the Jinpu General Bureau was also expanded from Jinan to Dezhou. Although it cannot directly reach Tianjin, passengers can already change trains in Dezhou. However, large quantities of mail and freight cannot be transported smoothly. Qu Yucan also gradually felt that it was difficult to support. When Shi Yousan went to Jin to Liaoning, he accompanied Shi to see Zhang Xueliang to discuss maintaining the bureau. Just when Wu Tiecheng, a representative of the Central Committee, was entrusted by the Ministry of Railways to ask the Northeast to return the Jin Bureau, Zhang had already agreed. When Qu saw Zhang, Zhang immediately ordered the Jin Bureau to be handed over and transferred him to the Zhengtai Railway Bureau. Tang Wengao, the deputy director under Qu's tenure, was transferred to the Cangshi Road Engineering Bureau. On the 27th, Zhang specially telegraphed the Tianjin Bureau to rush to handle the handover. The original telegram said, "Jinpu Railway Administration Bureau, Director Qu and Deputy Director Tang, review and check. The establishment of the Jin Bureau in the northern section of Jinpu was originally a temporary expedient measure, and the railway administration is in urgent need of unification. The Jin Bureau will be canceled immediately, and all files, etc., will be transferred to the General Bureau for takeover. Director Qu Yucan will be transferred to the Zhengtai Railway Administration Bureau, and Deputy Director Tang Wen will be transferred to the Cangshi Railway Engineering Bureau.

<h3 id="e73">A Glimpse of the Battles at Shilong, Binyang, and Hengxian <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The war in Guangxi Province has suddenly become tense recently. Zhang and Gui's armies are taking advantage of the fact that the besieged Gui army has retreated to Pingma. In recent days, they have concentrated forces from Liuzhou, Nanning, and Long'an to launch attacks on the Eighth Route Army's positions. Previously, the newly organized division of the Eighth Route Army, led by Zhu Weizhen, stationed in the Shilong and Liangcun area, engaged with plainclothes teams on the 24th and 25th of last month. On the night of the 24th, Zhu Weizhen's division dispatched Huang Pin's brigade and part of Li's regiment to attack Shilong City and Xiangxian, engaging in battle with the Gui army near Liangcun for three hours. The Gui army provided artillery support from across the river, but the enemy was ultimately defeated by Zhu's division's charge, resulting in over 30 enemy deaths, including five company and platoon leaders, over 50 soldiers, and the seizure of 50 rifles. The enemy in Shilong City retreated completely that day. On the 27th, over a thousand men from the Gui army, led by Zhu Tao, launched a surprise attack on the Eighth Route Army in Shilong and Liangcun, with Zhu Weizhen as their target, aiming to scout Wuxuan. Another enemy force of over 500 men, led by Su Meisen, took a small path to outflank Liangcun on the opposite riverbank, attempting to contain the Eighth Route Army's rear in Wuxuan. On the morning of the 28th, they indeed attacked Wuxuan, but fortunately, the Eighth Route Army's Zhu division had already dispatched Huang's brigade to guard against the attack. When the enemy troops arrived at</p>
<p>Ertang, troops were immediately dispatched to intercept them. After a fierce four-hour battle, Zhu Weizhen's division sent Li Shiqi's regiment to reinforce, and the enemy finally collapsed and fled in disarray. The Gui army's battalion commander, Zhu, and platoon leader, Li Ji, were captured by Huang's brigade, and over 300 rifles were seized. The remaining enemy forces fled towards Laibin. The enemy plainclothes team in Wuxuan dared not attack again after this heavy blow. However, in the southeastern corner of Nanning, the besieged Gui army was gathering far away in Pingma. The Gui army in the city took the opportunity to harass the Eighth Route Army's positions in Guixian and Yongchun.</p>
<p>On the night of the 28th, remnants of Huang Shaoxiong's forces secretly passed through Pumiao and Yongchun, reaching the Eighth Route Army's position, led by Yang Dingzhong, over 20 li away from Hengxian. Yang's division's Li brigade discovered them and dispatched Lu Huanrong's regiment to intercept, ultimately defeating the enemy. Now, Division Commander Yang (Dingzhong) has decided to mobilize the entire division within the next few days to attack Nanning. The Li and Gong brigades under his command have already advanced towards Hengxian. Yang himself also departed from Wu on the 31st, accompanied by several dozen guards, first going to Guixian to personally lead the brigades stationed in Yongchun and Hengxian, taking the road through Pumiao to launch an attack on the southeast of Yongcheng. The northwest of Yongcheng will be completely taken care of by the remaining divisions of the Eighth Route Army and Huang's brigade. Recently, battles have also broken out near Binyang, due to the sudden concentration of Li Zongren's army from Liuzhou in Long'an, Qianjiang, Wuming, and other places.</p>
<p>On the 26th, over a thousand Gui troops attacked Ninyang, engaging in a fierce battle for four or five hours. The Gui enemy was defeated by the Eighth Route Army, which added Tan Langxing's regiment and Wei</p>
<p>Feng, and retreated to Qianjiang. Due to the frequent outbreaks of war on the front lines, Chen Jitang, the commander-in-chief of the Eighth Route Army, intended to return to Guangdong to meet with Gu Yingfen, but was unable to do so. He only sent Li Yangjing, the commander of the 63rd Division, by plane back to Guangzhou to discuss everything with Gu in person. (November 3rd)</p>
<p>The Suppression of Bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Begins with a General Offensive</p>
<h3 id="e74">Anhui Troops to Join the Campaign <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The suppression of bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces began with a general offensive on the 5th. Before the general offensive, the troop deployments in Hunan and Jiangxi were extremely meticulous, and the contact with the bandits was also victorious in every engagement. The situation is described in detail below:</p>
<p>Situation of Bandit Suppression in Jiangxi Province: The bandits and communists rampaging in Jiangxi Province are led by Peng Dehuai, Huang Gonglue, Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and others, gathering in Ji'an, Jishui, Qingjiang, Xiajiang, Zhangshu, Xuanfeng, Luxi, Xintai, Shili, and other areas, with Ji'an as their main base and Zhangshu Town as the front line. Lu, the commander-in-chief of the 9th Route Army, Ping-shi, in view of the rampant bandit</p>
<p>forces, telegraphed the Wuhan Headquarters for instructions, and flew to concentrate the troops assisting Jiangxi as scheduled in order to issue an order to attack, and on the 3rd, personally flew to Ji'an to detect</p>
<p>the enemy's situation, and immediately returned to the province. His troop deployment was based on Zhang Huizan and Xu Kexi as the first column, Luo Lin and Li Jue as the second column, and Tan Daoyuan and Deng Ying as the third column, responsible for launching attacks. The Central Smuggling Suppression Group and the two divisions of Mao Bingwen and Xiong Shihui were responsible for the reserve force. Peng Qibiao's brigade was responsible for protecting the Nantao Road, and Gong Bingfan's division was responsible for guerrilla warfare. Zhang's division was already in Zhangshu, Luo's division was in Shanggao, and Gong's division was in Gao'an, respectively concentrated and ready. The remaining troops were also concentrated at the designated locations and started the attack on the 5th.</p>
<p>Situation of Bandit Suppression in Hunan Province: The most rampant bandits and communists in Hunan Province are those under Nan Hua. He Long's troops are in Nanxian, and Kuang Jixun's troops are in Huarong, in conjunction with the remaining bandits in Pingjiang and Liuyang, and in coordination with the Jiangxi bandits. He Jian, the commander-in-chief of the 4th Route Army, ordered Liu Jianxu, the commander of the 19th Army, to command Peng Weiren's division and jointly suppress the combined forces of Zhang Ying's division from Sichuan. On the 30th of last month, Nanxian was recovered. He Long's bandit troops fled towards the Hubei border. The bandit suppression troops continued to launch fierce attacks, advancing on Huarong in three routes. The first route was Zhang Ying's division from Sichuan, which attacked Huacheng directly from Meitian Lake via Ayu Xu. The second route was Peng Weiren's division, leading the two brigades of Liu Jiren and Dai Guangyuan, which attacked from</p>
<p>Zhenjiazu, Zhongheyuan, and Chishongting on the front. The third route was the Nan Hua teams, which immediately advanced from Wuzui and Changchun to the county seat to search for remaining bandits. After the bandits lost Nanxian, and the bandits lost Huarong, it was difficult for them to gain a foothold in Hunan. The bandits then fled in two routes, one to the northern border of Li County and one to Shishou and Songzi. The remaining bandits under He Long then fled back to Gong'an, and encountered Xiang Chengjie's troops at Ouchi, resulting in a fierce battle for several hours. Xiang's troops were outnumbered, and the bandits took the opportunity to attack Gong'an directly. At the same time, the remaining bandits under Kuang also infiltrated and occupied Shishou. According to aerial reconnaissance reports, there is currently no trace of bandits in the Nanxian and Huarong areas. However, there are still a few remaining bandits in Meitian Lake, which belongs to Huarong, who have been bombed and killed by bombs. The head of Gong'an City has dozens of red flags erected, and the order in the city is chaotic. There are also several red flags in Shishou City, and the market is extremely desolate. Anhui Province Joins the Suppression Campaign: Anhui Province borders Hubei and Jiangxi. During the joint bandit suppression campaign in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, it is difficult to ensure that the bandits and communists do not</p>
<p>for this reason, Anhui Province also needs to join the suppression campaign. Recently, the bandit alarms that have occurred in the border area between Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces have been more severe than before. For example, Fang Zhimin's bandit troops appear and disappear in the border area between Anhui and Jiangxi, including Huizhou, Qimen, Qiupu, and Jingdezhen. Li Can's bandit troops in the border area between Anhui and Hubei, including Huangmei, Guangji, Qichun, Susong, Ying Mountain, and Huoshan counties, frequently harass the area. It is reported that the central government will order the joint suppression of bandits in the four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, with the Wuhan Headquarters acting as the host. He Chengjun will also serve as the commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression in the four provinces, and the troops stationed in the four provinces will be under his command, so as to achieve unified command and a permanent solution. It is reported that this order will be issued to Hubei by the central government soon. (November 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e75">Sends Troops to Resolve the Remaining Forces of Gao Guizi <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the disintegration of the Northwest Army, they have surrendered to the central government one after another. The cavalry division of the army, led by Zheng Dazhang, still has more than 5,000 men stationed at the junction of Hebei and Henan, and has not yet been attached to any force. Recently, they sent representatives to Jinan to request that Han Fu be accepted, and an agreement has been reached. They will enter the Caozhou area within a few days to await inspection. According to the headquarters of the 2nd Army Corps, Zheng's troops will be transferred to Jiaodong for training after the inspection is completed.</p>
<p>Also, the remaining forces of Gao Guizi in the Yizhou area, led by a certain Lu, were previously accepted by Chen Xiaosi, the commander of the 2nd Shandong Garrison Brigade. Now Chen's brigade has been ordered to go to Anhui, but a part of Lu's troops do not listen to the dispatch and act freely. They are currently in the territory of Rizhao. This time, Cao Fulin's eastward expedition to supervise the bandit suppression, the 1st regiment of the 65th Brigade Commander Tang Yaoxun's troops went to Zhucheng to resolve this issue.

<p>Jinan Correspondence: Qingdao Mayor Hu Ruoyu arrived in Jinan on the 3rd evening by the Jiaoji Road train from Qingdao. The train arrived at Huangtai at 9:10. Yu happened to be at Huangtai for business, so he boarded the train to meet Hu and had the following conversation. Yu asked the mayor what his mission was in Jinan this time. Hu replied that he had no mission in Jinan. He was passing through Jinan because Vice Commander Zhang had telegraphed him to go to Shenyang, and he wanted to meet with Chairman Han. He would take the Pingpu train tonight to Tianjin and then go to Liaoning. Yu asked if it was true that Vice Commander Zhang and Commander-in-Chief Chiang would meet in Qingdao. Hu replied that Chiang and Zhang had long thought of meeting, but the location and date had not yet been determined. Yu asked if the mayor had heard any news about Yan and Feng stepping down. Hu replied that he had not received any telegrams recently, but since the Northeast Army had been ordered to enter the customs, the situation in the north could be optimistic, and Yan and Feng would not be a problem. Yu asked the mayor what new plans he had for developing Qingdao's municipal administration. Hu replied that detailed plans could not be explained in a few words. Simply put, (1) Qingdao's education, young children's culture level is too low, decided to find ways to rectify and improve. (2) Qingdao is a special area where Chinese and foreigners live together, and the public security problem is very important. Decided to make every effort to rectify the police affairs, so that the citizens of Qingdao can live in peace and become a paradise by the sea. (3) Qingdao is a commercial port, and industry and commerce must strive for development to compete with foreign businessmen. Other things such as wharfs and waterways should also be repaired. The only difficulty is funding. The city's current income is only 400,000 yuan per month, which is enough to cover the current situation. If various construction projects are to be carried out, it is far from enough, but I am determined to work hard regardless of the difficulties. During the talk, the train arrived at Jinan Station, and Yu said goodbye and got off the train. Han Fuju sent Li Shuchun, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Chen Weixin, the mayor of Jinan, as representatives to welcome Hu. Hu got off the train and briefly talked with the welcomers, and then went to the Jiaoji Hotel to rest. It is reported that Hu is scheduled to take the Jinpu Road No. 202 express train to Tianjin at 6:30 tonight, and then go to Shenyang. (November 4th)</p>
<p>Coal Cars on the Jiaoji Railway Derail</p>
<h3 id="e77">Vehicles Travel More Than 30 Li on Their Own <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: A collision between freight cars and coal cars occurred on the Jiaoji Railway on the 3rd, causing the vehicles to derail and the tracks to be damaged, temporarily disrupting traffic. Unexpectedly, last night (the 4th), three coal cars on the railway derailed and traveled more than 30 li on their own. It turned out that a train of coal cars numbered 561 of the 1st Army Corps' Grain Bureau</p>
<p>departed from Boshan at 11:00 on the night of the 4th and traveled to the east of Dalinchi Station. The last three coal cars suddenly derailed. Because the road from Dalinchi to Mashang via Zhoucun is a downward slope and the slope is very large, the cars flew eastward after derailing, passed Zhoucun Station and only stopped in Yazhuang, which is 15 li east of Zhoucun (Yazhuang has a fork in the road but no station). When passing Zhoucun Station, the station only heard a rumbling sound in the middle of the night and could not tell what kind of vehicle it was. At that time, the third passenger train from Qingdao had just passed Dalinchi. If the passenger cars were east of Dalinchi, passengers would have been in danger. The train commander was Chen Heshu (the younger brother of Chen, the former Director of the Department of Construction), and the locomotive was No. 509 on the Pinghan Railway. The extent of the damage to the vehicles and tracks is not yet clear. The following is the telegram from the train commander's report: "The 561st coal car of the Military Grain Bureau stopped suddenly between Zhoucun and Dalinchi tonight. The undersigned got off the train to check and found that the locomotive had run out of steam. At this time, the driver opened the steam valve with great force, causing the car hook to be broken and the car to derail. Because it was a downhill slope, it immediately rushed backwards and could not be stopped. The undersigned immediately used a signal to stop the front part of the train and tried to slowly return (return to Zhoucun</p>
<p>Station). It is known that the car has temporarily stopped east of Yazhuang (Yazhuang is about 40 li from Dalin</p>
<p>Pool), so I will send a telegram first. (November 5th)</p>

Various agencies and organizations here received the news and had organized a welcoming party at the Jiangkou Zhonghua Grand Hotel. However, last night, Chen received a telegram from Li Er____, the chief of staff left in Bengbu, requesting him to go to Bengbu immediately to preside over important matters. Therefore, Chen has already left Nanjing for Bengbu today, and the date of his arrival in Wuhu has been postponed.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 bandits and communists in Langxi County were previously suppressed by Xu's regiment and Yan's battalion of the 57th Division, which were dispatched from Guangde. The bandits scattered and fled. However, the Provincial Chamber of Commerce here received a telegram from the Langxi Chamber of Commerce in Liyang, stating that the bandits and communists in the county have been rampant in recent days, and the county seat is in danger. They requested that the military authorities stationed in Wuhu be approached to dispatch a large army to encircle and suppress them to prevent the spread of the problem. Xu's regiment stationed in Wuhu has already dispatched the 6th company and the mortar and machine gun company to set off today. They will wait for the telegram from their superiors before dispatching a larger army to wipe them out in one fell swoop. The tenant farmers in Wuhu's Wanchun Township have been resisting rent and refusing to pay, and the problem has not been resolved to this day. Yesterday, more than 300 tenant farmers who resisted rent suddenly gathered, holding small flags and demonstrating in Wuhu to petition the county government and request a meeting with County Magistrate Yu. County Magistrate Yu received four representatives, including Ai Cheng-sung and Wang Shanhe, at the first hearing and immediately detained them for supervision. At the second hearing, three representatives, including Zheng Xiangyuan, were received at the gate and immediately arrested and imprisoned. The petitioning farmers even attempted to break in, but were dispersed by the police team.</p>

<p>Defeated Sheng Bandits Retreat to Their Old Nest: Bandits from Sheng County disturbed Tangtian, Hutang, Lizhou, and Beixi villages the previous month. According to reliable information, after the security teams from the four counties of Yu, Feng, Xin, and Sheng converged, they launched an attack at the end of the same month from Youzhuping, Jiangfan, Longxi, Pingkeng, Tangxi, and Lutian villages, guided by the militias. They advanced in the rain directly to Tangtian and engaged in a fierce battle. The bandits, unable to withstand the attack, retreated in disorder towards Chongren in western Sheng. Zheng, the company commander of the 11th Company of the 6th Security Regiment, believed that the villages had suffered greatly from the recent bandit disturbances. A prolonged presence of a large army would increase the burden on the people. Furthermore, the Sheng bandits had lost most of their strength and were unlikely to make a comeback.

<p>The Future University President Must Be an Ideal Figure</p>
<p>Nanjing, 6th - Student representatives from Zhongda (Central University) petitioned the National Government's Ministry of Education. The Ministry expressed sympathy for the students' opinions and swiftly dispatched President Jiang Menglin. The decision was to respect the students' opinions and ensure that the future university president would be an ideal figure.</p>
<p>The Zhongda Student Union will hold a by-election within two weeks of the start of the semester, as stipulated in its charter. It has been nine weeks since the semester began. On the 5th, a general student meeting of Zhongda resolved to suspend all activities of the current Student Union Executive Committee during the by-election period. On the 6th, the current Student Union issued a notice stating that when the fourth proposal was discussed at the general meeting, members gradually left the meeting, and the venue did not have a quorum. In accordance with Section 22 of the "Preliminary Steps in People's Rights," the fourth proposal was declared illegal. The Student Union will implement legal resolutions and deny illegal resolutions lacking a quorum. At the same time, it will submit a request to the National Government's Ministry of Education to accept the standards for the new president and swiftly appoint one. However, with the Zhongda students' general meeting denying the activities of the Student Union, a domestic dispute is imminent.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Detailed Record of Zhongda Student Congress <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported on the general outline of the student congress held on the afternoon of the 5th at Zhongda to discuss the president's issue. Here is a more detailed record of the meeting, divided into sections, to clarify the truth behind the student unrest.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Military and Police Authorities Closely Monitor <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Since the Zhongda turmoil began, the Capital Garrison Headquarters has constantly dispatched detectives to monitor the situation at all times to prevent any reactionary elements. It was rumored that the authorities feared that some malicious elements might take the opportunity to disrupt order during the general student meeting held on the afternoon of the 5th. Therefore, on that day, fifty military and police personnel were dispatched to the venue to closely monitor and prevent accidents.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Discussion of Meeting Rules <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Because there were so many people attending the general meeting, the Secretariat, which prepared for the general meeting, feared that the discussion of proposals would be chaotic and difficult to achieve results. Therefore, it posted slogans all around the venue, such as "Maintain Order in the Meeting," "Don't Give Outsiders a Pretext," "Discuss Personal Issues with Conscience," "Speak Calmly and Avoid Argumentation," etc. In addition, five special rules were discussed: (1) Each speaker may not speak more than three times on each proposal per month. (2) Each speech may not exceed five minutes, and the explanation of a proposal may not exceed ten minutes. (3) Amendments and temporary motions must be seconded by two or more people before they can be established. (4) Each proposal is passed if there is no objection after the chairman has seconded it twice. (5) No one may speak after the chairman announces the end of the discussion on each proposal.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Consolidation of Proposals <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Several days before the meeting, the secretariat put up a notice to collect proposals from all students. The secretariat classified the proposals collected into eight cases as the basis for discussion at the meeting. Eight hundred and forty-four students attended the meeting. Before the meeting began, Chairman Tang Zuoquan took the stage and reported that there were 1,530 students in the school, and that the 844 students present constituted a quorum. He declared the meeting open. The chairman reported that the purpose of the meeting was threefold: (1) Since the launch of the school's reform movement, students have often made proposals for improving school affairs in the name of individuals or small groups, rather than the proposals of the entire student body. Improving school affairs is a matter of vital interest to the students. Today, we can take this opportunity to express everyone's opinions and consolidate them into the opinions of the entire Zhongda student body. (2) The community has paid close attention to the school's reform movement, and the news has been widely reported, but it is often inaccurate, leading to incorrect comments that are extremely detrimental to the school. Today, we must publish a declaration on the cases decided by the general meeting to correct the community's comments. (3) The successor to President Zhang has not yet been determined after his resignation. If the government does not resolve the president's issue quickly, it will affect the suspension and reorganization of the school. Therefore, this meeting is convened for detailed discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Discussion Situation <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>During the discussion of the proposals, Liu Shichao chaired the first proposal: Should we express our attitude towards President Zhang's telegram to the faculty, staff, and students, expressing his firm resignation? The original proponent of the proposal, Jiang Xuegan, explained the reasons and content of the proposal, stating that he proposed that the school should use the name of the entire student body to send a telegram to retain President Zhang. If President Zhang does not come, we will discuss the successor candidate. After the explanation, most students opposed the proposal, saying that if we send a telegram to retain President Zhang, all past movements to improve school affairs would be meaningless. Furthermore, the facts prove that President Zhang has no possibility of returning to the school. "Resolution": No attitude will be expressed towards President Zhang's resignation. The second proposal resolves as follows: Given that President Zhang has expressed his intention to resign, the criteria for the successor should be determined as soon as possible to prevent ambitious people from coveting the position. Reason: The school resides in the capital and is the highest institution of learning in the country, bearing the responsibility of leading the national culture. The selection of the president should be particularly cautious. There are many people outside coveting the position. A single misstep would make future disputes even more unbearable. Survival and peril rest on this one move. The congress should determine the criteria for the successor candidate. Criteria: (1) One who enjoys high prestige for their scholarship and morality and has no bureaucratic habits. (2) One who can focus on their duties and has the determination and ability to develop Zhongda. (3) One who has achieved effective results in running higher education. (4) One who has a considerable history in the Party and the country. The third proposal was proposed by Zang Gonghui, Liu Maotang, and 54 others: The congress should propose a candidate for president based on the criteria for president and submit it to the government for selection and appointment. Candidates: (1) Yu Youren (2) Cai Yuanpei (3) Weng Wenhao (4) Hu Hanmin (5) Dai Jitao. After the proposal was made, most people believed that among the many talents in China, Zhongda's president could not be limited to the above five. Once proposed, it would be enough to cause misunderstandings and disputes in society and elsewhere. It is better not to propose. "Resolution": The entire proposal is rejected.</p>
<p>The fourth proposal was resolved and passed as follows: Please have the congress issue a declaration based on the following principles. Principles as follows: (1) The school is located in the capital and bears the mission of leading the national culture. The government should pay attention to the criteria for candidates as decided by the congress when selecting and appointing the successor president. (2) If the successor president does not meet the criteria decided by the congress, we vow to oppose them with all our might. (3) The students of the school will continue to attend classes with peace of mind and will not engage in any improper behavior. It is hoped that people in the community will not be misled by rumors deliberately spread by those with ulterior motives. (4) The school is responsible for the free and legitimate activities of external affairs groups. The congress generally denies anyone who pretends to be the official group or individual representing the entire school and any actions of the school's student union that violate the congress's resolutions. (5) The students of the school deeply believe that Party-based education will never violate Party doctrine.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Meeting Disruption <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>When the fourth [unclear character] was resolved, two students proposed a proposal: Students have been leaving the meeting one after another, and the meeting no longer has a quorum. According to the provisions of the "Preliminary Steps in People's Rights," the meeting should be adjourned immediately. Most students opposed this proposal, saying that those who attended the meeting and left voluntarily gave up their right to [unclear character]. The congress continued the discussion. Both sides argued fiercely. Some advocated changing to a talk show. Some asked the chairman to expel those few who were disrupting the order of the meeting. The atmosphere at the meeting was immediately tense. The Garrison Headquarters agents monitoring the scene immediately asked the chairman to stop the meeting to avoid disruption. Finally, those who questioned the number of people withdrew automatically, and the discussion of the fourth proposal continued.</p>
<p>The fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth proposals argued that the matter was not an urgent matter and should be submitted to the next congress of representatives for discussion (the original proposals are attached). Now, a very important temporary motion is being discussed and resolved as follows: (1) The current Zhongda Student Union is not sufficient to represent the opinions of the entire student body. The school president's issue is of great importance. A special committee should be formed to represent the entire congress in handling all issues related to the new president, both internally and externally, until the new president arrives at the school. The special committee will then be disbanded. The special committee will consist of nine members elected by a vote of all students. Before the committee members are elected, the chairman of today's meeting, Tang Zuoquan, Liu Shichao, and Tu Juyao, will be responsible for all matters related to the drafting of declarations and elections. The direct meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>The four proposals left to be discussed at the next congress of representatives are as follows: (5) Reason: The school authorities are advised to establish a graduate school within the shortest possible time. Method: (1) Officially establish the graduate school this year and officially recruit graduate students in the summer vacation of next year. (2) Determine the funding for the graduate school: First, the additional funding of 120,000 yuan will be used as the graduate school's recurring expenses. Second, a portion of the funding for each school will be allocated to the graduate school. Third, submit a request to the government to specifically increase the recurring expenses of the graduate school. (3) Hire famous professors to guide research. (6) Reason: Request the school authorities to increase the number of free places and set aside a considerable amount of funding as a loan fund. (7)</p>
<p>) Reason: Request that the school authorities keep the library's McCoan Reading Room open all day during the winter vacation. (8) Reason: The congress should send someone to thoroughly investigate the various committees that used the school's name without anyone taking responsibility and issue a declaration to clarify the truth. Reason: The school has repeatedly discovered declarations and leaflets from the "Central University Nursing School Movement Committee" and the "Central University Anti-Traitor and School-Saving Committee" without anyone taking responsibility. To avoid misunderstandings from the outside world, we should thoroughly investigate and issue a declaration to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>Declaration Against Encroachment on Educational Rights</p>
<p>The Public Concession's Municipal Council recently added an education department to investigate primary schools in the concession area and bring them under its jurisdiction, encroaching on China's educational rights. The Party Headquarters of the four districts of the city believes that this matter is of great importance to national rights and the future of education. It specially convened a meeting of all executive committee members yesterday to discuss the matter and resolved to notify all school principals in the district to hold an emergency meeting on a regular basis and issue a declaration to arouse the attention of all sectors of the city and the country and unanimously oppose it.</p>
<p>The declaration is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Citizens of the whole city! Recently, the true face of imperialist cultural aggression has been glaringly exposed before our eyes. The concession authorities have established an education department and want to rule our national education within the concession. How ambitious is this ambition, and how seriously should we pay attention to it? We have three opinions to use as our cry in this declaration: First, we frankly and unceremoniously denounce the ambition of the concession authorities to establish an education department. Second, we want to promote the total awakening of schools in the concession to give the running dogs under the sphere of imperialist influence a stern warning. Third, we want to enable the citizens of the city to monitor the insane ambition of the concession authorities. Citizens of the whole city! This time, the concession authorities' measures have made us realize that imperialist arrogance is not retreating due to the rise of the world's small and weak nations, but is even advancing by retreating. It wants to use enlightened methods of plunder to divide the tide of national revolution. The concession authorities want to establish an education department to win over and numb the schools within the concession. This is indeed the best way to start. In fact, if we take a look at how many concessions there are in our country, once their ambitions are realized, we believe that bases for imperialist cultural aggression will spread throughout the country in a few years. Therefore, today, when national educational rights are unified, and when autonomy is complete, we do not need imperialism to divide our already unified educational rights. At the same time, under the complete autonomy of the nation, no ambition is absolutely allowed to devour any part of our autonomy. Citizens of the whole city, the fact is indeed the case. When imperialism wants to establish a concession education department to deceive us, we have indeed found that the past concession education was indeed extremely barren. This is the failure of those responsible for running education. Therefore, this has created such a situation. Imperialist aggression is "drilling where there is a hole" and "entering where there is no hole." The ambition to establish a concession education department originally saw that there was a hole to drill, so it became unstoppable. Therefore, the responsibility lies on the shoulders of the schools in the concession. They should recognize their own position and the nation's position to see through the intentions of the imperialists' measures and give the small running dogs of imperialism a serious warning on an orderly front. At the same time, for the sake of the non-unified educational rights of the nation, they should pay attention to everything in the future. Citizens of the whole city, since our territory has had a concession, it has been associated with so many sins, so much disturbance, and so much pain. The abyss of all evils is created intentionally by imperialism and its running dogs in the concession authorities. Recently, it has wanted to use the concession to encroach on our educational rights. It is a more enlightened but essentially more cruel hand. Citizens of the whole city, use our national wisdom to conquer the ambition of the concession authorities! Issued on November 6, year 19.</p>

<p>The outside world is largely unaware of the truth about the school affairs dispute at Labor University. Yesterday, the reporter met with someone from the school affairs meeting of the school, who said that the current school affairs dispute is entirely caused by the administrative staff Peng Xiang, Cheng Gan, and [unclear character] holding and manipulating the situation.

<p>The Municipal Wusong Middle School has always been strict in guiding students' studies, but fearing that it would become too boring and reduce the effectiveness of their learning, it pays special attention to students' learning interests.

<p>Riri News reports that Guo Jingkun, the wife of Cai Gongshi, went to Nanyang to raise funds to establish Gongshi School in Shanghai to commemorate the significance of the Qingnan Massacre. Former Ambassador Wang Jingqi, Central Committee Member Zhou Qigang, and famous gentlemen such as Huang Jiahe, Guo Shouchun, and Chen Wu[unclear character] established the school's Standing Committee to carry out all school affairs. Cai's wife has already prepared 100,000 yuan for the construction of the school buildings, but it is especially difficult to buy land due to the high prices. Mayor Zhang, based on his intention to promote education, agreed to allocate land to help and has ordered the Education Bureau to find a suitable location to allocate. Yesterday, Chen Xueyi, the Director of Studies of the school, and Ji Shiying, a teacher, went to the Municipal Education Bureau to show the method, but unfortunately, Director Xu went to Beijing the day before to participate in the Industry and Commerce Conference, so they did not get the gist. It is heard that the Education Bureau has decided to allocate a suitable address in the Jiangwan area of ​​the central district for the construction of school buildings, and Gongshi School plans to establish a specialized school of Chinese politics and diplomacy.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Table Tennis Federation reorganized its staff, its affairs have been greatly renovated. In addition to the original president system, it has also established general affairs, economic, competition, document, and referee departments, and has hired experts to assist in the management of each department. To pass the revised constitution and hold a United Cup competition, a joint meeting of group representatives and staff will be held at 10:00 AM on November 9 in the Jiande Society's table tennis room. It is heard that groups wishing to participate in the United Cup competition may send representatives to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>Explanation of Soochow's Termination of the Jiangnan University Tennis Match (Continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>(3) The statement "Furthermore, the referee left the meeting without obtaining the opinion of our school, which is not the attitude that a referee should have" is even more incomprehensible. At that time, the sports instructor could not be found, so the team members themselves suggested that the director, Yu Juntingzhi, go to the tree to discuss the issue because they wanted to avoid the heavy rain. Since both parties had representatives to discuss the matter, how can it be called leaving the meeting? What's even more wonderful is that it says "without the consent of the team." In that case, what does the representative put forward by the team represent?</p>
<p>It also said, "Since the first game was completed in the rain, the second game could of course be continued. Otherwise, before the start of the first game, the referee could have sought the opinions of both parties to determine whether to proceed." Although the sky was slightly dark before the start of the game, it was not raining. So, should it be stopped at that time? And after the first game was completed, it was raining heavily, and both teams of players became drenched chickens, and there were injuries [unclear character]. In that case, even if the athletes are injured and sick, is the referee still not authorized to stop the game? Alas, I know it! At that time, Mr. Ni was probably sitting comfortably in the house, warming himself by the fire, and did not know that his classmates were drenched in the rain and could slip and fall. No wonder he has these words.</p>
<p>(5) As for the statement that "Our school tried its best to argue for the continuation of the game, but the referee insisted on stopping it. Therefore, our school could not tolerate this kind of decision that violated the constitution and decided to withdraw from the game," its intention is to say that the referee acted arbitrarily. However, little did he know that the case had already been decided by the general meeting and was still said to have been stopped by the referee. Furthermore, Section 3 of Article 5 of the Constitution of the Four Universities Athletic Association states that "For all issues, except those belonging to the scope of the rules, the referee has the right to decide. The decision of the Executive Committee is the final decision." Alas, Mr. Ni is fabricating facts in this way. How can it be called the words of a righteous person? As for the section on the decision that violates the constitution, it is not clear which constitution Mr. Ni violated, whether it is the constitution he remembers in his heart or whether there is any basis for it. According to Section 1 of Article 2 of the regulations of the Four Universities Athletic Association, "All competition rules are based on the reasonable [unclear characters] determined by the Far Eastern Games as the standard." Therefore, according to Article 13 of the volleyball rules promulgated by the Far Eastern Games of the National Sports Federation of China, "Suspension of the Game" states, "If the game cannot be continued due to rain, darkness, or other reasons, the referee has the right to announce the suspension of the game." According to this article, the referee should have the right to stop the game without having to solicit the opinions of both parties. However, for the sake of harmony between the two parties and a complete solution, the chairman was requested to convene a special meeting. Ni is a newcomer and Hujiang has not grasped the spirit of the Four Universities Athletic Association, so there is a record of withdrawing and forfeiting the game halfway through the first Four Universities. This is not only a major stain on the Four Universities Athletic Association, but also destroys Hujiang's reputation for athletic ethics in society. Alas, I cannot help but feel sorry for Hujiang sports, the Four Universities Athletic Association, and the future of Chinese sports. I never want to talk too much or be too involved, but for the sake of Hujiang, the Four Universities Athletic Association, and the future of Chinese sports, I have to make the above statements to clarify the beginning and end of Hujiang's forfeiture. I hope that the sports instructors will not regard their momentary intentions as rules and regulations, but will regard the establishment of regulations as the standard for handling affairs. I have high hopes. Written by Xu Minhui on the morning of November 3 (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e108">Issues with the Education Department of the Concession (Zhou Shang) (Continued from Yesterday) <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Education Department has, in reality, been changed to the Education Office. However, the forms used for this survey of schools within the concession still boldly bear the title "Education Department." What is the reason for this? According to the Chinese Directors, the Concession Education Committee (details about this committee will follow) wishes to improve Chinese education and should first gather materials, follow scientific methods, proceed step by step, prescribe the right remedy, and then make improvements. Therefore, it was decided to survey schools within the concession, nominally under the "Shanghai Municipal Council Education Office." However, it was mistakenly written as "Education Department." Upon investigation, the mistake originated with the head of the Education Office, Healey, who approved the decision made by the committee. The Chinese members of the committee then questioned the authorities about this, nearly leading to a conflict. After a thorough investigation, it was discovered that the error lay with the secretary. Truly, a difference of a hair's breadth can lead to a loss of a thousand miles! A name represents an institution, and the matter is of great importance. If the Municipal Council mistakenly referred to itself as the National Government, how would the authorities rectify the situation? I secretly believe that the secretary should receive severe punishment, and the head of the Education Office should also offer a proper explanation.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Education Committee <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Directors of the Ratepayers' Association proposed reforms to Chinese education in the concessions. At the same time, they felt that the organizational structure of the Municipal Council's educational administration was flawed. Therefore, in March of this year, the "Education Committee" (Board of Education) was established, acting as an advisory body or a council. The resolutions of the committee are generally implemented by the Education Office. The committee members serve in honorary positions without stipends or remuneration. The aim is simply to reform education in the concession. Currently, there are seven members: three Chinese and four Westerners. Yuan Ludeng and Bell are ex officio members by virtue of being directors of the Ratepayers' Association. The remaining members are elected by the Chinese and Western directors of the Ratepayers' Association, respectively. Meetings are held every two weeks, with special meetings convened when necessary. In addition to the seven members, the Municipal Council's General Manager Edwards and the head of the Shanghai Municipal Council Education Office Healey attend the meetings. It is rumored that a Japanese person will soon join, but their name is not yet known.</p>
<p>Chinese readers are likely familiar with the qualifications of the Chinese members, so I will not elaborate. Regarding the backgrounds of the Western members, according to investigations, Shapard is affiliated with the church, Earl is a former professor at the University of Hong Kong, and Bell and Cela are both selected members. We should not ignore these facts. Furthermore, the proportion of Chinese members is only three out of eight, and no one is attending meetings. This seems unfair, and I sincerely hope that our Chinese Directors will strive to change this.</p>
<p>Since this committee is tasked with improving education in the concessions, what achievements has it made since its establishment? The establishment of elementary schools in the Western and Eastern districts, the purchase of school land worth over 400,000 yuan in Tilanqiao and near the North Station, the construction of housing for teachers and staff, and the planning of secondary schools are all among its accomplishments. However, many people are unaware of these things for reasons that are not yet fully clear.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Hopes for the Chinese Authorities <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The failures of concession education are too numerous to list. The number of out-of-school children reaches over 150,000. Unscrupulous private schools inflict endless harm on young people. Pornographic and seditious publications, degrading plays and songs, gramophone records, opium dens, gambling establishments - all things that injure public morals and lead people into pitfalls - originate from the concessions. Before the right to education is recovered, we have the following hopes for the Ratepayers' Association and the Chinese members of the Education Committee:</p>
<p>(1) Urge the concession authorities to realize the situation and promptly return the right to education to us.</p>
<p>(2) Formally announce the abolition of the Education Department.</p>
<p>(3) The organizational structure of the Municipal Council's educational administration should be reported to the Chinese people immediately.</p>
<p>(4) If the Chinese members of the Education Committee face any difficulties, please explain them frankly.</p>
<p>(5) Demand that education funding account for 25% of the total revenue and guarantee its independence.</p>
<p>(6) If the objective cannot be achieved, the Chinese authorities may withdraw entirely to seek a solution. (The End)</p>

Chairman Kong Xiangxi announced the continuation of the fifth group review report. Shi Ying rose and said that before the report, regarding the review report of the fifth group, the reviewers had signed, but the original proposer was not listed. This was because one or two people were temporarily reviewing and signing to show responsibility, not that the entire review had been signed. Please do not misunderstand.</p>

<p>Hu Shuhua reported the results of the fifth group's review of the third category, the promotion of domestic goods. There were a total of 19 proposals. Zhang Zilian said that it was difficult to collect goods for the domestic goods exhibition hall, and there were not many goods. The local government should buy the goods at half price, which would make collection easier.</p>
<p>Pan Xulun said that regarding the third point of the review report, regarding the user requesting the government to set an example for the people, the words "absolutely" not using foreign goods should be removed. The chairman said that he would pay attention to this point when organizing the entire case. Hu Shuhua said that this point was included in the detailed report. Huang Shoumin proposed that the entire review report on the promotion of domestic goods be passed. There was a seconded motion, and it was resolved that "the entire review report on the third case be passed."</p>
<p>The fourth category, industrial raw materials, was merged into the first category and reviewed and resolved to "pass."</p>
<p>The review report on the fifth category, industrial product standards, was completed. "The entire case passed." The review of the sixth category of other cases, except for cases 5 and 68, was resolved to pass.</p>

<p>After Pan Gongzhan finished reporting, the chairman asked to discuss the unemployment relief case first. Wang Xiaolai said that Article 12 of the review report ordered that existing factories should not experience work stoppages or strikes and should add malingering. Pan Xulun, Zhang Zilian, Shi Ying, and others advocated that there was no need for arbitration methods. Ding Jingchen said that this case was for unemployment relief and there were no regulations on work stoppages or malingering and advocated maintaining the original text. Pan Xulun said that this conference was not a way to raise funds and could not absolutely prohibit work stoppages, strikes, etc. and advocated that labor-capital arbitration should handle the matter. Wang Yunwu seconded Mr. Pan's proposal and added the words malingering to the original text.</p>
<p>Wang Jiean said that malingering is the cause of unemployment and the word malingering should be added. Mu Ouchu said that the original text added or malingering three words. Hu Shuhua advocated that Article 12 be cancelled and there should be no work stoppages, strikes, or malingering in the full text to avoid misunderstandings. Zheng Hongnian and others seconded the proposal and resolved that "Article 12 be revoked in full"</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan continued to report the review results of the industrial and commercial relief case. Wang Ruoxi cancelled the full text of Article 12 on labor-capital disputes. Pan Xulun seconded the proposal and resolved that "passed" The chairman said that regarding the industrial and commercial relief case, if there were no differences other than Article 12, please raise your hands and resolve that "all passed"</p>
<p>Pass the first group</p>
<h3 id="e121">Review Review Report <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The review review report was discussed and reported by Wang Hantao as follows: This group was submitted five review review cases by the conference (Article 17, Article 27, Article 35, Article 36, Article 40). After discussions at the meeting, the review results of each case are listed below. It is still subject to public decision.</p>
<p>Case 17: Outline for Improving Industry and Commerce Proposer: Zhang Zilian Review results: The intention of item 1 of the first article of this case is very good, but the government needs to consider the custody methods and procedures. For item 2, the National Government has already promulgated regulations, but it seems that there should be a definite fundraising plan for the custody method of the fund before it can be discussed. For item 3, please check with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to see if it can be implemented. For item 4, the intention is very good. Each item of its second article also has insights. Except for the first item of the six strategies listed later, the remaining items are proposed to be passed by the conference in principle and sent to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for separate selection.</p>
<p>Case 27: Eliminate foreign enterprises in China to resist economic invasion</p>
<p>Proposer: Zhu Binyuan Review results: Each item proposed in this case is extremely important, but the word abolish in the first item of the method should be changed to limit. The fifth item, foreign participation in the management or supervision of public utilities operated by foreigners in China, should still be changed to promptly recover it and operated by the Chinese. The remaining items of the method seem to be appropriate. It is proposed that the conference pass it and send it to the government for adoption.</p>
<p>Re: Cases 5, 14, 31, 75, and 87, a total of five cases, were originally merged into this case for review. If this case is passed by the conference</p>
<p>Please the government adopt it</p>
<p>Case 35: Please establish protective measures to maintain the basic industry in the Northeast Proposer: Chu Guangxu Review results: The Northeast is particularly severely affected by foreign economic invasion compared to the mainland, and soybeans and wheat account for an important share of exports. The government should formulate special economic policies to effectively protect various basic industries. The original case should be sent to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for maximum adoption.</p>
<p>Case 36: Restricting shops from displaying foreign goods on their fronts Proposer: Chen Zhaodong Review results: This case is still practically impossible under the current social conditions, but the proposer is quite bitter in the face of the proliferation of foreign goods. If the national industry and commerce can unite and carry out the work, it may not be impossible in the future. It is proposed to send it to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for reference.</p>
<p>Article 40: Trade regulations that should be submitted to the competent official agency for approval should be uniformly observed by the same industry. Proposer: Shanghai Social Bureau Review results: Please forward it to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (all of the above passed)</p>
<p>Pass the case of approving trade regulations to be followed by the same industry</p>
<h3 id="e122">Pan Gongzhan, Wang Yansong, Wang Yunwu, and Wang Jiean vigorously advocated <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Pass in principle and ask the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to adopt and implement</p>
<p>Next, the members discussed the trade association case, and the discussion situation was as follows:</p>
<p>The review results were reported by Wang Hantao. Wang Yansong believed that Article 40, proposed by the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, stated that trade regulations of various industries that have been approved by the competent official agency should be uniformly observed by the same industry if they are not members of the association, was important and should ask the original proposer to explain the reasons.</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan said that regardless of whether or not one joins a trade association, there should be no difference in trade regulations, otherwise those who join the association will uniformly abide by them, while those who do not join the association can change them at will. If the same industry is affected and the official agency's approval is ineffective, it will not be a blessing for industry and commerce. The trade regulations and industry regulations agreed upon by the same industry can supplement the shortcomings of the law and maintain the progress of commerce. For example, if the money industry association resolves on the daily foreign exchange rate, all industries in the city will uniformly abide by it, and there will be no monopolistic malpractices. If trade regulations cannot be consistent, the association will inevitably disintegrate. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce takes the trade associations of various industries as its basic associations. If it cannot maintain them, the General Chamber of Commerce will be difficult to isolate. The Social Bureau recognizes the importance of these trade regulations, so it proposed this case and asked everyone to discuss it.</p>
<p>Tian Jinbo said that the trade regulations vary from place to place. For example, trade associations in the interior often oppress small-scale operators. This case should be considered.</p>
<p>Wang Yansong said that the organization of the trade association and all the executive committees are composed of fair people elected by the same industry and there is no such thing as suppressing themselves, so there is no need to worry too much.</p>
<p>Mu Ouchu reported that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had previously received the applications for record from hundreds of trade associations and the Social Bureau in Shanghai and had repeatedly discussed the matter with the competent department. It was felt that the trade regulations were indeed factual, but they conflicted with the law, so they were rejected.</p>
<p>Wang Yansong said that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce often handles commercial disputes based on the customary law of various industries. There have been no conflicts with the law in various processes. This time, the Shanghai Trade Regulations Maintenance Committee entrusted me as a representative, and my responsibility is great. Furthermore, the importance of party trade regulations has been explained by member Pan.</p>

<p>81. Regarding the difficulties arising from the joint and several liability for partnership businesses stipulated in the Civil Law, the speaker argued that after a vote in principle on this case, the legal aspects should be submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to the Legislative Yuan to include this intention in the Trade Association Law.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaoxian stated that, according to Vice Minister Mu, the facts and the law often cannot be reconciled; he proposed that the Legislative Yuan should pay attention to the facts and include them in the regulations. Fang Jiaobo stated that the trade association's rules and the law do not conflict; the resolution of this case should be adopted and implemented by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and should not be included in the judicial scope.</p>
<p>Wang Jie'an stated that those who do not join the trade association may not comply with industry regulations, which is very harmful to the market; the Ministry of Industry and Commerce should be asked to adopt a resolution.</p>
<p>Hu Shuhua asked the chairman to stop the discussion and first vote on the principle of the case, and then ask the Judicial Yuan to interpret the legal aspects.</p>
<p>Fang Jiaobo stated that after the principle is passed, it should be handed over to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for handling, without the need for interpretation by the Judicial Yuan.</p>
<p>Wang Yansong seconded.</p>
<p>Wang Yunwu stated that trade association is necessary for the development of commerce. Those who have not yet joined the association should be persuaded to join. The resolution should only be handed over to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for handling, without the need for interpretation by the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>The chairman agreed with the trade association's rules, but the Legislative Yuan is in charge of the drafting of industrial and commercial laws and regulations, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has no room for objection. The chairman proposed that the principle of this case be passed and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce be asked to adopt and implement it.</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan stated that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce should be requested to approve the Legislative Yuan to change the law and include this article in the Trade Association Law.</p>
<p>Huang Shoumin advocated that the principle should be passed and the rest of the text should be discarded. Jiang Zudai seconded. Finally, the chairman passed the resolution to have the principle passed and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce adopt and implement it.</p>
<p>Please agree on supplementary articles to be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for supplementary relief and sent to the Ministry to be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for adoption.</p>

<p>The current Industrial and Commercial Conference was held in the capital. Leaders of the industrial and commercial circles in this city were all invited to be members and went to Beijing a week ago. Leaders of the business community in this city, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jiying, Hu Mengjia, etc., returned to Shanghai yesterday due to business matters. Standing Committee members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaoxian, Ye Huijun, etc., are scheduled to return to Shanghai tonight because they still need to fight for the industry rules of various industries. Industrial educator Xu Peihuang also returned to Shanghai yesterday after attending the conference.</p>
<p>Members attending the Industrial and Commercial Conference, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaoxian, Yu Shushu, etc., all returned to Shanghai on the night train of the 6th.</p>
<h3 id="e133">External Affairs Banquet for Members <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Wang Yunwu talked about scientific management and the rationalization of national industries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs hosted a banquet for all members of the Industrial and Commercial Conference at the World Hotel on the evening of the 5th.</p>
<p>Wang Yunwu talked about scientific management and the rationalization of national industries. He had previously been asked by the General Assembly to draft a complete proposal. He has now drafted a proposal for the Industrial Rationalization Research Committee, modeled after the German Industry Certification Design Committee. The drafting of this proposal has been completed and it can be reported at the General Assembly on the 6th. The method is to organize a national industrial rationalization research committee with the aim of planning a complete national economic research, organized by four types of groups and organizations: (1) central competent authorities and administrative agencies related to industry, such as the Construction Committee; (2) national academic groups, such as the Science Society, the Economics Society, the Industrial and Commercial Management Association, and the Engineering Association; (3) professional groups, such as the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the National Banking Association; (4) labor group representatives. Several experts will be hired by members to form a sub-committee to conduct detailed research on a certain issue. At the same time, because experts cannot be stationed at the association on a regular basis, a cadre department and a research department will be formed to handle all expenses. The central government is expected to allocate funds for this item.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Ren Jinpin Appointed as Member <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Since Mr. Zhang Zilian, who runs the National Products United Department Store, hired Mr. Ren Jinpin as the design director, he has been working tirelessly to reorganize the store. At this conference convened by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in Beijing, Mr. Zhang has been invited to attend as a leader in the commercial world, and he has instructed Mr. Ren to go to Beijing together to plan the progress of the national products department store and request government support. After Mr. Ren arrived in Beijing, he immediately held his proposed "National Products Business Plan" and actively campaigned for it for two days. He also went to the private residence of Vice Minister Mu of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce with Mr. Ye Huijun and Mr. Zhang Zilian to ask for assistance. It is heard that the members from all sides have seen Mr. Ren's plans and have expressed great sympathy. The Industrial and Commercial Conference has also paid attention to the suggestions and plans of Mr. Ren, introduced by Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Jiaobo, Lin Kanghou, Pan Xulun, Xu Yongzuo, Zhang Zilian, and other gentlemen. They have already printed the agenda and invited Mr. Ren as a member on the 3rd, and he attended the General Assembly on that day.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Unofficial History of Fishing Boats <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Lian Weng</p>
<p>The theory of the nine-surname fishing boats in Zhejiang is that Chen Youliang and his generals belonged to nine surnames in the spring, such as Chen, Cheng, Ye, and Xu. Emperor Taizu of Ming hated Chen and tricked him onto the boat, forbidding him from landing. He showed it to the Tinghu households in Guangdong and the households in Yong, etc. to show his demotion. After the national system was changed, the Zhejiang People's Hall began to discuss abolishing the old rules and ordered the counties where boats were moored to investigate and report separately. Now there are signs of success. From then on, there will be no more sweet-scented osmanthus paddles or orchid-decorated oars coming and going in Qili Longzhong on the Qiantang River.</p>
<p>Fishing boats gather on both sides of the Jianggan Gate, like wild geese with ropes strung together like pearls. The springboards are horizontal and vertical, and they all meander in one breath. The rails of the boats are half-rolled up, and those leaning on the railings are mostly beautiful women. The married women are the wives of those born in the same year, and the unmarried women are the sisters of those born in the same year. This is because most of them are from Tonglu and Yanzhou. Tong and Yan are a sound shift of those born in the same year. The Qing Dynasty had a boat bureau to manage the assets. All officials going upstream drove this boat at full speed, and those passing through were also like this. If they were idle and bored, young men in silk robes and wooden clogs would borrow them as places to set up banquets. At that time, the reputation was extremely important, not just a song and a bundle of silk. During the Qing Dynasty, the bureau was abolished, and the women also moved their boats to the shore, displaying their colorful flags between the Haiyue Bridge and the Huapai Building.</p>
<p>Outside of Jianggan, only the boats of Lanxi and Yandongguan are still considered medium-class. If you go down to Quzhou and Longyou, and reach Yiqiao and Wenyan, although they are the same fishing boats, the furnishings and social gatherings are inferior. The boats turn around and leave. Even if you know Yan Ge well, you don't easily enter his tent. Otherwise, the turbans you want to get will cost thousands of dollars. Attendant Lang Zhupo fell in love with a woman and actually hired her for five thousand gold and impeached himself and resigned. The so-called imperial clan, the Eight Banners, famous scholars, grass, Jiangshan, nine-surname beauty, and hemp. The fishing boat is also called Jiangshan boat, so there is this couplet. Although there have been slight changes recently, the scholars did not dare to ask for the tripod. Once it is eliminated and restored to freedom, its merits will be ten times better than Jiliang's.</p>
<p>Alas, I can't forget Pupu's pipa and Bai Chuan's strings and songs in Qinhuai. I hate people and keep my old Hongxue. When I get this news, I dance and squat. I take notes with tears. I just keep the old stories of the southern fireworks.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Ancient Customs of Sichuan <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Zheng</p>
<p>Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, said in a speech one day that Sichuan Province is rich in ancient customs, because the residents do not close their doors at night, do not pick up lost items on the road, the sounds of chickens and dogs are not heard, and the people do not interact with each other until they die. At that time, the listeners all praised him. However, Mr. Dai is from Sichuan and almost suspected that he was exaggerating his words. Then Mr. Dai explained, "Those who do not close their doors at night are because the houses of the people have been turned into ruins and broken walls by the artillery fire after the war, and there are no doors to close. Those who do not pick up lost items on the road are because they have been digging up tree roots and grass skin to eat due to years of famine, and there is nothing to pick up. The chickens and dogs have all been slaughtered, so what sounds can be heard? The people have been displaced and scattered, so even if they want to interact with each other, they cannot say they have. Sighs are endless." Therefore, those who sighed that the ancient customs of Sichuan still exist could not help but feel depressed, and on the other hand, they admired Mr. Dai's skill in speaking.</p>
<h3 id="e142">In Memory of Yu Shuyan <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>Among those who perform male roles with beards in Peking opera, two stand out for their ability to assimilate the strengths of others and make them their own through ingenuity: Tan Xinpei and Yu Shuyan. Old Tan, due to his local connections, was initially closer to Yu Sansheng. He also favored using clever techniques to achieve flexibility and beauty in his melodies, rather than relying on brute force. This aligned with Yu Sansheng's approach, so his art was heavily influenced by Yu, while also drawing from Cheng and Wang, selecting the best and expanding upon it to create the Tan school. Shuyan, as the grandson of Yu Sansheng and the son of Ziyun, had a distinguished family background. Later, he studied with Old Tan, gathering the essence of Yu Sansheng and Xinpei, combined with his own inherent strengths, to create his personal art, thus establishing the Yu school. It can be compared to a businessman: Old Tan initially borrowed capital from Yu Sansheng, widely adopted the strengths of others, and, like adding his own funds, greatly profited. Later, when Shuyan sought to reclaim his original capital, Old Tan provided him with as much as he could, including Yu Sansheng's original artistry, supplemented with the learning of Cheng and Wang, repaying the principal with interest. Thus, Shuyan received significant assistance. He also relied on his family's legacy as a foundation and knew how to utilize his own ingenuity to pioneer new paths. Therefore, although his achievements did not break free from the Tan school's framework, his timing was particularly fortunate. Unlike Old Tan, who faced strong rivals like Wang and Sun, he was able to firmly establish his dominance. Hence, the name of the Yu school was established not long ago, and it has already been admired both North and South. Shuyan achieved seventy to eighty percent of Old Tan's art. However, due to his relatively lesser talent, he often modified what he felt unable to master, revealing weaknesses. Some used this to attack him for not adhering to Tan's methods, denouncing him as a "false Tan." In reality, Shuyan had his own irreplaceable qualities, and it's inappropriate to belittle him for this. Shuyan had unique insights regarding the use of falsetto, making it as resonant and melodious as his natural voice. He was meticulous in his study of the four tones and the distinction between palatal and retroflex initials. However, his use of abrupt sounds was excessive, and the endings of his phrases often felt too rushed. His martial arts skills were due to his early performance of martial plays such as "Picking the Hua Che" and "The Linked Rings," demonstrating steady and precise movements. Few can match him today. Watching his Kunqu opera "Ning Wu Pass" and the Peking opera "The Battle of Taiping" reveals the depth of his skill. Furthermore, his "Washing Floating Mountain" and "He Tianbao" demonstrated skills in tossing horses and wielding knives, skills that can only be accomplished with genuine ability. Aside from Shuyan, Yang Baosen also devoted himself to this play. Shuyan excelled in spoken drama. Watching his short play "Losing the Seal and Rescuing from Fire" is far superior to the current popular plays such as "Borrowing the East Wind" and "The Honest Official's Record." However, today's audiences seem to treat theater like a buffet: they only crave quantity and don't have time to appreciate the flavor. It's no wonder they favor lengthy and strenuous plays like "Borrowing the East Wind." Shuyan was not only skilled in acting but also excelled in playing the jinghu. His jinghu player, Li Peiqing, was often personally instructed by Shuyan in composing and adjusting melodies, resulting in a lively and dynamic quality. Experts have often stated that a good singer must also be skilled in playing the jinghu. Today, few performers can fulfill this criterion. Moreover, Shuyan possessed both civil and martial skills, and was proficient in Kunqu opera. Who else can compare to him? Shuyan was literate and skilled in calligraphy. The plaque of the Peking Opera Guild of Beiping bears his elegant writing, a rare achievement for a performer today. It has been seven years since Shanghai last saw Shuyan's performance. I and my friends Shaoqing eagerly await his early arrival in the South to dispel the demonic atmosphere of pretentious and trendy male actors.</p>

<p>— Lao Zhuo</p>
<p>Xue Yanqin has come to Shanghai for the second time. I had never seen her before, but those who have always praise her beauty. Recently, I and my friends have been watching plays at Tiansheng Theater every night, and I have seen her perform in "Lian Jin Feng," "Pan Si Dong," and "June Snow." All of them are excellent. Her costumes are delicate and beautiful, her figure is slender and well-proportioned, her recitations are clear, and her singing voice is round and melodious. She is especially good at using her voice to create light and agile transitions that are captivating. With all these qualities, it is no wonder that she is highly praised. She is indeed a top female performer. I also watched Hao Shuchen perform "Zhan Ma Su" and "Xie Ma Su," which depicted Ma Su's stubbornness; and "Da Cao Bao," which depicted General Cao Bao's drunkenness and recklessness. His "Peach Blossom Village" depicted Lu Zhishen's boorishness and his habit of fighting for justice. The expressions were all lifelike, and his spoken lines were as forceful as cutting nails. He is unmatched among contemporary clowns. I have greatly enjoyed watching these plays, so I am writing this record.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Impressions of West Lake (Part 1) <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Huijian</p>
<p>I have been living in the human sea of Beijing for six years, and I have been engaged in the life of a scribe, my body and mind are exhausted. One day, I gathered with my companions at the Qinhuai River. In the boat, someone suggested traveling for two or three days. Some proposed going to Louxia Mountain to see the red leaves, while others proposed going to Tangshan for an autumn bath. However, they are not far from Beijing, only enough for a half-day round trip, and the taste is not strong. Everyone was hesitant. Suddenly, someone quietly rose and said, "The refreshing breeze and flowing water of West Lake have been lingering in my mind for a long time. If you are willing to join me, I will depart on the morning train tomorrow. Please make a decision quickly." I happily agreed first, and Si Lan also applauded in approval.</p>
<p>On October 5th, the three of us went to Shanghai by morning train and stayed in a hotel for one night. On the morning of the 6th, we changed to a bus to Hangzhou. In the bus, we further discussed going to Haining to watch the tide on the 8th. Traveling from Hangzhou by the highway bureau's bus is convenient because the road is not very long and the cost is also lower, compared to taking a special train from the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway. We arrived in Hangzhou at around 2 PM and got two rooms in a hotel by the lake. This day was the Mid-Autumn Festival in the old calendar, and there were many people watching the tide who had come to West Lake in advance. The commercial districts by the lake were very lively. After taking a bath in the hotel, we changed into light clothes, took our walking sticks and cameras, and set off. We found a boat near the park pier. Xia Han and the boatman bargained over the price. I quietly stood by the water, revisiting old memories. The entire lake was bathed in the autumn sun, revealing a silver-gray color. A gentle breeze stirred it, revealing golden ripples. The mountains of Longmen on the shore sat majestically, like smiling teeth welcoming visitors. The two high peaks in the north and south still looked menacing as before. Closer up, the Su Causeway was like a belt, lined with verdant willows, an incomparably serene and beautiful scene. The islet of Gushan in the north, with its multiple pavilions and towers, seemed even more magnificent than before. Boats in the lake came and went like shuttles. After we settled the price, we boarded the boat and headed north. We passed a villa, with a graceful blend of Chinese and Western styles. The boatman said it was Zhang Jingjiang's residence, while Xia Han said it was the Hangzhou municipal government. Passing this, we arrived at the Zhaoging Temple pier and went ashore. We saw the colorful temple gate in the distance, seemingly showing its solemnity. Entering the temple to the west wing, we saw a group of monks entering a large room in a line, presumably for dinner. A monk was supervising from the side, his eyes glaring and his nose flared, as if he was very powerful. The monks were afraid and each received a bowl of light yellow vegetables to eat, seeming to enjoy it. We then went to the front hall to visit and saw four or five monks eating at another table. The dishes included five bowls, one being mushrooms and another dried lily flowers in soy sauce. The supervising monk was also sitting among them, eating heartily, and seeming embarrassed to be seen. Leaving the Zhaoging Temple, we proceeded west along the shore to Broken Bridge, where the boatman had already moored the boat to wait. The road here was very well maintained and clean, and there were more Western-style buildings. I heard that land prices on the north shore of West Lake are several times higher than on the south shore. There seems to be a trend at play here.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 15: Tears Fall in All Directions, Lamenting Red Passions; Hearts are Won, Lingering Green Sentiments</p>
<p>Not long after, Yixing Shu's illness ultimately took its toll. During his illness, he told his friends that he deeply regretted getting married, as it only caused his wife the most pain. Naturally, his wife was the one who suffered the most. The reporter will not continue with this tragic story, as it would only cause grief. At that time, the Pingbao Newspaper had a club called Shanglu, where many friends would often gather during their free time, just like swallows on a beam, coming and going freely. However, among the friends, there were always new faces replacing the old. Some of the regular friends suddenly had other matters and stopped coming, while a new group of friends came instead. Only Long Ziyun, Ling Zhixiang, Yi Yunshang, and Lin Fanzi were regulars who never went anywhere else. They would sometimes patronize male prostitutes and sometimes play small games of mahjong. This was because the newspaper work started in the afternoon at four or five o'clock, and after going to work at seven or eight o'clock, they would take a break to go out for dinner and relax. They would then go back to work at ten o'clock, just like people who work during the day take a lunch break. One day, Long Ziyun invited some friends to a Beijing cuisine restaurant for dinner. Those present were all regulars at the Pingbao Newspaper. The poet Zuo was also among them. Both Ling Zhixiang and Long Ziyun liked to call for prostitutes to sing. They said that without women present, the atmosphere would be dull and uninteresting, causing a sense of dryness. Even if they engaged in leisurely conversation, these people, who met often, had exhausted their topics of conversation. Furthermore, with women present, the atmosphere would often be lively and interesting. Ling Zhixiang then suggested calling for prostitutes. Due to his business relationships, he had many social engagements outside, so he was a prominent figure in the prostitution world. Everyone in the brothels knew him. He was also very easy to talk to. If someone asked him to go to another brothel, he would go. If someone else asked him to go, he would also agree readily. He would sit with someone he recognized, or someone he recognized as a procurer. Over time, he would open dozens of accounts for each festival. Whenever he went out for pleasure, in addition to the people he usually called, he would also let his friends write down names for him, and he would agree casually. Sometimes, when a prostitute came, he wouldn't even know her name or where she lived. He would sit down briefly, say a few words, and leave before the seat was even warm. If you asked him, he wouldn't know either. However, there were some girls with good memories who would engrave the names of the customers who had called them in their hearts, remembering exactly who had been to which brothel. Those who were not good at remembering might have called him three or four times already, but when they called him again a week later, it would be as if they were strangers. This was partly due to memory and partly due to whether they had feelings for that person. Often, in a sea of people, there would be someone with whom you felt an instant connection. It's the same with making friends, like watching flowers and drinking wine while traveling in the northern pleasure quarters.</p>
<p>Corrections: In the previous issue of "Warmth in My Heart," in the fourteenth line, the phrase "Everyone knows that he is dying" was missing a "die" character. In the twenty-second line, the phrase "It seems like there is no body" was missing the words "there is no." In the twenty-third line, "sad laugh" was mistakenly written as "sad cry," "almost" was mistakenly written as "dangerous," and "gradually" was mistakenly written as "gradually Pan." The editor is urgently making corrections.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Financial and Gold Market Movements are Nonexistent <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>There are many observers. The Autumn horse races on the 6th have passed. Gold business transactions are as usual. The bidding for both the front and back markets is relatively stable. The trend is slightly upward, but because each firm has no large-scale transactions, there is no special change in price. The whole city only calculates the difference of three taels, which is really not far from the rollover. The exchange rate is apparently tight and secretly stable, and the listed price has been reduced by half, presumably because the overseas silver market is trending lower. Day She Price opened high. Zhifeng, Yongtai, Kangrun, and Yuanheng initially bought and then sold. Yuancheng and Yongshunli all made purchases. Changfu and Yu Yongchengchang all sold. Because people's minds are not calm and distracted, the price sometimes fluctuates by one or two taels. Later, trading in the market became even more scattered and the price fluctuated between eighty-three and four taels. In short, the longs and shorts are observing, and the shorts are not in good timing. Due to the rollover, a high plate was seen in the morning. The opening price for December was five hundred and eighty-four taels and two qian, which added one tael and nine qian, probably because the large silver ingot fell to one-eighth, and the silver price also shrank by three-eighths (the gross plate was at eighty-three taels plus four taels). Shortly after, there was a fluctuation of more than one tael, and the sale from the retail customer fell to three taels and four qian. Then, Zhifeng Yong and hedgers jumped up more than two taels, reaching eighty-five taels and six qian at 9:10 AM. It is also known that HSBC's listed price should be shortened. Suddenly, it slightly fell by about two taels, probably because the British gold banks for January mutually traded at 174375. When the first order was announced, it had already shrunk by 125 US dollars and 2 jiao. The gold price only increased by five or six qian, and was at eighty-five taels. Then, it was seen to be frustrated. The inner plates' exchange rates were all flat. In November, US dollars and Japanese yen were mutually traded by other banks at thirty-nine yuan and one qian two five. And from Fuchang and others sold until 9:45 AM, it fell to three taels and nine qian. Later, Mitsui bought January US dollars at thirty-nine yuan three one two five. North Korea bought the current Dalian tael at one tael two qian six fen four three seven five. Also, because the Dalian gang and Yuanheng Taikang Run bought, it jumped to two taels, and at 10:00 AM, it rose to eighty-five taels and eight qian. Afterwards, the price fluctuated, fluctuating by two taels. Yu Yongcheng Changfu Chang and retail customers had some sales until after 11 o'clock. Dadecheng then bought Yuanheng. And the price fell from five taels to four taels. At 11:20 AM, it was three taels and eight or nine qian. Suddenly, it rose to one tael, reaching five taels and one or two qian. Until after 11:30 AM, Yongfeng, Zhifeng Yong, Yongyongcheng Chang, etc. did not forget to sell. This has already fallen by more than two taels, and only counts as eighty-two taels and nine qian. Because the British gold of January could not be sold easily at one seventy-four three seven five. Until noon, because of retail pursuit and the industry lifted, the market closed at eighty-three taels and seven qian, and then fell slightly by three or four qian. The listed price was changed to six hundred and nineteen taels and eight qian. Because the Japanese gold increased by one point, it was initially pressed at thirty-five or six taels. Then, it was thirty-four taels at noon and thirty-six taels.</p>
<p>The evening market was deserted. The market opened at eighty-three taels and three qian (the gross plate was shouted at around four taels, but there were not many transactions). Afterwards, the market was in a peaceful state, being around eighty-four taels. It then retreated from eighty-four taels and one qian to three taels and a half. The firms mostly had scattered transactions. After 2:30 PM, it only went up and down by three or four qian. Until about 3:30 PM, Chenfeng Yong and Zhifeng Yong entered the market and advanced. For a moment, it increased more than one tael, reaching four taels and eight qian, probably because the exchange rate was relatively flat. Mitsui Huabi and McCallum Heilan mutually transacted forward British gold at 174375. Japanese merchants traded January Citibank at thirty-nine yuan three two one five. After moving time, Yuda was selling on the field, but there were no actual slips. However, the price was suppressed by two taels, reaching two taels and seven qian at 4:15 PM, really because people's minds were empty and there was a rumor that it would be frustrated. Then, it increased by a few qian, and at 4:30 PM, the market closed at eighty-three taels and one qian, which was a gain of eight qian compared to the previous noon. Afterwards, it continued to make a little, and it has been lifted to three taels and six or seven qian. It was found that the maximum price in one day was eighty-five taels and eight qian, and the minimum price was eighty-two taels and seven qian, a difference of three taels and one qian. The goods opened at three taels and four qian, closed at three taels and two qian in the afternoon, and the afternoon market closed at three taels and four qian. The listed price was thirty-six or seven taels.</p>
<p>Trading is sluggish, and trading between firms is not very agile. Yuancheng Yong Dachencheng Shunli and Yongheng all entered. Yu Maoyong flattened. Taikangrun Yuanheng Zhifengyong entered and then exited. Wanyu Yuda Fuchang Yongchengchang generally had more outflows than inflows. In the afternoon, Chenfengyong Hongli Zhifengyong Shunli Wanxing all entered. Yuda Taikangrun and retail customers then sold. The entry and exit of goods vary greatly. The Dalian gang bought more than nine hundred bars and sold seven or eight hundred bars. They were all a small number of hedges. The Guangdong gang was silent.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Foreign Exchange is Apparently Tight but Secretly Stable <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market slightly turned lower and the market is now stable. However, Citibank is buying and the exchange rate is flat. As for HSBC's listed exchange rates, they have been reduced by half a grade due to the fact that British gold is reduced by one two five, and is now one shilling and seven pence one two five US dollars 25 is calculated as thirty-eight yuan seventy-five Japanese exchange is added one point and calculated as one tael two qian eight fen five Indian is reduced by half a yuan and calculated as one hundred and seven rupees two five Holan is reduced by seventy-five and calculated as ninety-six shields. The French franc is reduced by eight yuan and calculated as nine hundred and eighty-five yuan. The Singapore exchange is increased by one tael and calculated as one hundred and forty-five taels and five qian. The German exchange is reduced by one yuan and calculated as one hundred and sixty-two marks and a half. Hong Kong is reduced by five qian and calculated as eighty-two taels. However, the inner plate's British, American, and Japanese exchange rates are still flat. It seemed to see a gold price uptrend. Afterwards, it was mediocre and the noon moment was slightly loose and the bidding was frustrated. After the afternoon, it stood, but the gold market ended with only eight qian more, and the whole day fluctuated three taels. But there was no excessive disparity. When the market closed in the afternoon, the exchanges were similar to the British gold, and the US dollar was slightly reduced by one two five. The Japanese gold was pulled flat and Chinese merchants had a small number of transactions. It is estimated that British gold had transactions of 100,000 pounds, and two Japanese merchants sold slightly. However, British merchants did not have comparable purchases. For example, the Korean Sumitomo sold tens of thousands of pounds and then hedged the gold in the gold business. Each bank traded four to five million pounds, and also traded tens of thousands of dollars for US dollars, while Chinese merchants dumped tens of thousands of dollars. Mitsui and Mitsubishi delivered the bars that the Dalian Gang hedged back, and the Japanese exchange only sold them to Korea. The current Dalian has several million yuan and the market is quite quiet.</p>
<h3 id="e148">The Reaction to Frequent Rises in Silver Prices <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's telegram from London, large silver ingots suddenly turned and shrunk. It is a reaction to the continuous rise of several days. China has sold at low prices and the market is calm. After the market closed, the market turned stable and the United States tended to buy in at a small price. It is estimated that the recent decline of 125 is sixteen pence six eight seven five (equivalent to one shilling seven pence seventy-five). The forward also shrank 125 to sixteen pence six two five. Another telegram from New York said that the price of American silver also fell with it. Three seven five is calculated as the spot price of three jiao six fen one two five. The British dollar is rebounding. Zero three one two five is calculated as four yuan eight jiao five fen six five six two five. The US dollar to British dollar is added to zero six two five as four yuan eight jiao five fen seven one eight seven five. The Japanese dollar remains at forty-nine yuan six eight seven five. The British dollar to the British dollar remains at two shillings zero five six two five. The British Shanghai shilling is shortened by one two five and calculated as one shilling seven pence six two five. There is no telegram from Bombay. Also, at 11:50 AM at noon, Reuters' telegrams all saw a small rollback. It is estimated that the Japanese dollar fell by zero six two five to forty-nine yuan five six two five. The British dollar fell by zero three one two five to two shillings four six eight seven five. Also, the telecommunications agency has no increase or decrease.</p>

<p>Market Overview: Yesterday's market atmosphere was that the situation of foreign interest was extremely flat and tired. Suddenly, a bank bought in and the result was that the supply and demand had no slightest difference. Judging from the current trend, the price of interest seems to have no opportunity for soaring prices, or it may have a slight downward trend. Silver roots have been surging since Tuesday, but yesterday they were loose as before, and there was no possibility of an upward color. It can be seen that the change in the market atmosphere is temporary and will not be easy to change its slump for long.

<p>Yesterday's securities market for various bond market conditions: although there were many types of spot business, the transaction was still rare. The forward market was more prosperous. 96 suddenly had a sudden change. The morning was still quiet, but in the afternoon it rose rapidly. The highest price ever pierced through twenty-one yuan. At one point, the purchase was very active. The result was that the term of this month had increased by two yuan and one jiao and the term of the next month had increased by one yuan and seven jiao and a half. The sudden increase of 96 and the previous rumors that can be expected to be sorted out are not entirely unfounded. Also, tariffs have risen considerably.

<h3 id="e151">The Yarn Market Presents a Situation of Circling Downward <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market still appears weak. Standard yarn has fallen three or four taels in recent days, breaking through the 45-tael mark. This is because the actual sales of standard yarn are sluggish, and the various firms are becoming less interested in buying standard yarn due to its weakness, resulting in this downward trend. This is a problem inherent to the yarn market itself, rather than a speculative phenomenon. However, the excessive weakness of the market is enough to trigger a rebound. Moreover, the low price of 144 or 145 taels is already an expected sign. But the sluggish spot sales and the continued decline of Five Blessings and Shepherd brand yarns are obstacles to the development of standard yarn. Even if speculators manage to present a modest improvement, if these adverse obstacles are not removed, the future will still present a situation of circling downward.</p>
<p>Standard yarn fell in the morning and rose at noon. The exchange was bustling with people. Standard yarn opened in the morning with American cotton showing a falling trend, and the sentiment was particularly weak. Japanese merchants were also selling, but this was offset by retail closures. Near-month contracts fell by two or three cents, and far-month contracts fell by seven or eight cents. In the afternoon, the market remained soft. By closing, large buyers were actively buying, and the market suddenly tightened. Near-month contracts rebounded by eight cents to one tael and four cents, and far-month contracts rose by three cents to nine cents. Total trading volume for the day was 30,750 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price    Rise/Fall    Outstanding Balance      Closing Price    Rise/Fall    Outstanding Balance</p>
<p>November        145.5         Up to .32400            January          148         Down .133050</p>

<p>Spot Yarn Trading Slightly Better. Spot yarn trading on the market is slightly better, but there are still no large transactions. This is because the futures yarn market is weak, and the minds of various firms are also lukewarm. Total trading volume for the day was 984 bales, with 330 bales coming from inland firms, 30 bales from Wuhu firms and Huai firms, 10 bales from Guangdong firms, 145 bales from Sichuan firms, 10 bales from Shantou firms, 12 bales from Xuzhou firms, 15 bales from Fuzhou firms, 10 bales from Jinan firms, 156 bales from Yunnan firms, 55 bales from Jiangxi firms, 6 bales from Ningbo firms, 5 bales from Hankou firms, 20 bales from Qinhuangdao, 95 bales from fellow merchants, and 85 bales from Nisshin Yoko. Prices fell by five cents to one tael. 20-count Five Blessings and Shepherd yarns fell by one to two taels.</p>
<h3 id="e152">The Cotton Market Still Lacks a Significant Improvement <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market remains weak and sluggish. Inland, the listing of new goods is scarce, and market prices are high, so the sentiment is quite stable. However, the falling trend of foreign cotton has resumed, and factory demand is stagnant, while the yarn market has resumed its downward spiral, and the market sentiment has also become weak. The cotton market itself has no signs of weakness. The current situation relies entirely on the American and Indian cotton markets. The situation in the American cotton market is of particular concern to everyone. American cotton broke through the one-cent barrier due to reduced consumption and low general prices. Later, with the activities of cooperatives, it returned to over one cent and two cents. Recently, with increased production forecasts and no increase in consumption prospects, and the financial turmoil remaining unchanged, the market has weakened again and is showing a falling trend. In terms of the current situation, the key to the American cotton market lies in consumption and financial conditions. The production of 14.5 million bales is unlikely to undergo significant changes, and it is difficult to predict that consumption in the current quarter will exceed that of the previous quarter. Even looking at the weekly statistics of American cotton, the amount of American cotton shipped to factories worldwide in the three months of this quarter was 1,542,000 bales, a huge decrease of 3,310,000 bales compared to the same period last quarter. Even in the United States, it is a decrease of 1 million bales compared to the previous quarter. Under these circumstances, although the government is making efforts to provide relief, its effectiveness is limited. Therefore, the fundamental problem of American cotton lies in consumption. If consumption still does not see any special development in the next two or three months, and the financial situation remains unstable, the cotton market may see new low prices again. The government, on the one hand, is stockpiling, and on the other hand, is advising cotton farmers to reduce the acreage of new cotton fields next season. However, in comparison with the prices of general agricultural products in the United States, it is difficult to say what crops are suitable for planting. Recalling that the Bureau of Agriculture also advised farmers to reduce cotton planting acreage in the spring, but the result was what it was. Therefore, the effect of the movement to reduce cotton planting cannot but be doubted. With the situation of American cotton being what it is, it is difficult to expect the trend of the Indian cotton market to develop. If native cotton relies on American and Indian cotton in this way, then the general trend can be roughly understood. Hankou standard cotton follows the yarn market and stabilizes. In the morning, the Hankou standard cotton market saw a decline of over 20 pounds in American cotton and a weak yarn market. Japanese merchants were aggressively selling, and the market sentiment was extremely weak. Prices for all months fell by 2.5 to 3 cents. In the afternoon, with demand remaining stagnant, the market remained soft. Later, as the yarn market rebounded strongly, the market plate also tightened. Near-month contracts rebounded by 5 cents to 1 cent, while far-month contracts remained flat and weak. The total trading volume was 85,900 piculs. The closing prices of Hankou standard cotton are listed below:</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Closing Price    Rise/Fall    Outstanding Balance</p>
<p>February                        31.60         Up .05          143.200</p>

<p>Spot trading continues to be stagnant. Spot cotton trading remains sluggish. 1,319 bales of Yao cotton and 680 bales of Tong cotton arrived at the wharf. Transactions were as follows:</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 34.50 Zhang Factory took in 440 pieces Spot goods delivered to factories 32.00 Fellows merchants took in 600 bales Spot goods traded at the warehouse 33.00</p>
<p>October Foreign Cotton Imports Increase Sharply</p>
<p>Shanghai imported 40,590 bales of Indian cotton, 31,560 bales of American cotton, 250 bales of Egyptian cotton, and 200 bales of Burmese cotton in October, an increase compared to the previous month.</p>

<p>American cotton breaks through the one-cent barrier again. Yesterday, American cotton futures fell 22 to 33 points and spot prices fell 25 points due to poor news from Liverpool, mass sell-offs, weakness in Wall Street, and poor market conditions. British cotton futures fell 6-7 points and spot prices fell 13 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 20 points. The Indian cotton market was closed.

<h3 id="e155">Private Estimate of American Cotton <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>New York, 5th: The Fuchsick Bureau estimates this year's new cotton production at 14,196,000 bales, an increase of 221,000 bales compared to the previous estimate (October 4th). It also forecasts that the amount already ginned is 11,050,000 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Grain and Rice Market Prices Rise Steadily <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Arriving sources to Zhabei yesterday remained scarce, and market sales were quite active. Top-quality new japonica rice has reached 15 yuan and 6 jiao, an increase of more than half a yuan. With such a rising trend, one fears there may be special reasons involved; otherwise, although the weather is cloudy, domestic production prices have only increased slightly. Although there are various Zhejiang firms competing, the price increases may not be so rapid. Arrivals of thin paddy rice are extremely scarce, and the market lacks high-quality goods. Only medium-quality rice is being offered, with a price of 14 yuan and 5 jiao per 20 shi. Yangxian rice has also risen by 3 jiao, with top-quality rice offered at 13 yuan and 2 jiao, with very strong buying interest. Dujian rice is being snatched up by various stores, with top-quality rice offered at 13 yuan and 5 jiao, a premium of 4 jiao. The sudden jump of 5 or 6 jiao in Port Xian rice is due to the scarcity of goods, with top-quality rice offered at 12 yuan and 8 jiao. Kejian rice is also soaring by half a yuan, with Yan high-quality rice offered at 12 yuan and a few coins. With japonica and xian rice jumping sharply in recent days, the outlook is naturally bullish. Baiyuan rice is sometimes available and sometimes scarce, and the price is extremely firm.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the number of boats arriving in South Shanghai with meat-land rice remained scant, but trading on the street remained fairly lively. Changxi Bai japonica rice gradually tightened its prices, with special-quality high-end goods seeing a rise of two or three jiao. Su Tong machine-milled japonica rice continues to sell generally, only slightly better by two jiao. In the south, top-quality thin paddy and early rice are offered at 14 yuan and 9 jiao, with special high-quality rice requiring additional fees. Yangxian Dujian rice is consistently trending upward, generally better by two jiao. Zero-sales stores for this type of goods are mostly being inquired about, hence the frequent liveliness of the market. Currently, high-quality Yangxian rice requires 12 yuan and 3 jiao; Yin rice is only sporadically available, with high-quality rice offered at 15 yuan, from Guan Zu.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Remaining Foreign Rice Jumps by Three to Four Jiao <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin and this street all have purchases.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Tianjin merchants and those from this street took note of foreign rice. All the remaining flat-priced and later-fixed small-weight rice had transactions. Among them, 3,000 packages were remaining flat-priced and retrieved goods, handled by Bei Yang and retail households on this street, with prices ranging from 10 yuan and 05 jiao to 4 jiao. The later-fixed small-weight rice had 6,000 packages offered at 10 yuan and 2 jiao, handled by Xiechangde and other households on this street, with prices being two to three or four jiao higher than what was offered for sale the previous day. After this batch was sold, there were no more 　vouchers left in the market.</p>
<p>Flour Market Sees Lowest Record</p>
<h3 id="e158">Post-Market Rebounds to Stable Trend <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of each month fell due to the previous day's decline, with the lowest prices for each month being the lowest records of the year. Even though flour is not oversupplied, its current state of oversupply is, in fact, affected by foreign countries in terms of the situation. The lowest price of this month was 2 taels and 1 qian and 9 fen, December was 2 taels and 1 qian and 6 fen, January was 2 taels and 1 qian 5 fen and a half, February was 2 taels and 1 qian 5 fen 7 li and a half, and March and April were also around 6 fen, down 2 fen from the previous day's closing price. Afterwards, since the factories did not release, the sentiment turned stable. Until the opening in the afternoon, because the factories still did not release, the shorts were eager to cover their positions, so both near-term and far-term futures saw a rebound. The highest price for this month rebounded to 2 taels 2 qian 1 fen 7 fen and a half, and the rest also rebounded. Looking at the later trend, it should temporarily stabilize and not fall excessively. As a result, this month was better by 2 li and a half compared to the previous day, January was smaller by 1 fen 2 li and a half, February was smaller by 7 li and a half, and the rest were unchanged. The flour exchange, deeply concerned about the danger of a sharp drop in the market, stipulates that if the market falls below 2 taels and 1 qian and a half, a deposit of 300 taels must be paid.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Wheat Market Unanimously Turns Down <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the afternoon, the prices for each month unanimously turned down because the quoted price of foreign wheat was smaller by five, six, seven, or eight jiao, and with the weakness of the flour market, most people naturally took a bearish view. It was also heard that Fuxin recently had 9,900 tons of foreign wheat arriving by ship and docked at buoy number six, and was currently unloading. Considering the brisk dumping of the past few days, this was likely the reason. Therefore, the standard situation is that due to the deterioration of the environment, the subsequent trend may have to re-soften, which is not impossible. As a result, this month fell by 4 fen compared to the previous day, December fell by 4 fen, and January to April also fell by 4 fen. The spot wheat market still lacks high-quality goods, and the appetite of secondary factories is also declining. The entire city only offered slightly over 1,000 packages of Yaowan wheat, with secondary offerings being slightly higher by 1 qian or 2 qian, handled by Fufeng.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Raw Silk and Tea Shanghai White Factory Price Outlook Increasingly Weak <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firm silk market's price for Shanghai white raw silk factory was increasingly weak. The reason was that silk sales in the European and American markets were not picking up, and the trend of Yokohama's Japanese silk was not improving. Telegrams from Europe to Shanghai were scarce. Yesterday, only Renna imported ten packages of spot goods, and the Shanghai factory price had already fallen to 800 taels. Xinfu imported eight packages of Sichuan reeling silk, and the price was also flat and weak.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai silk factories affiliated with Shanghai's silk factories went on strike, because some shareholders entrusted silk orders and the work was relatively busy, twenty pieces of white raw silk from Zhenyi Silk Factory, Jin Shuangying and other brands were transported by the Shanghai-Wuxi passenger train yesterday, to make up for the orders for the previous month that had not been resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Qimen Black Tea Russian Sales Continue to Be Smooth <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai foreign firm tea market, the Russian Assistance Association's import interest in Qimen black tea continued to be strong. Over 1,000 boxes were transacted throughout the city, and the trading was not sluggish. However, the opening price was impossible to increase due to the small sales of British firms' shopkeepers. Luzhuang Zhenmei pearl tea, Tongfu Jinlong, and other shops all moved to buy Tunxi core-extracted goods. The top-quality price was set at 160 taels, and ordinary Zhenmei was priced at 85 taels, with no increase or decrease compared to last week. However, based on the current market situation, it is still difficult for the market to stabilize.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Sugar Market: Coarse Sugar and White Sugar Gradually Trend Lower <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>New York Sugar Rebounds Strongly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market reported that the price of Cuban spot sugar remained at 1.4375, the price of New York sugar futures for December was 1.38, March next year was 1.46, down 5 points from the previous telegram, May was 1.52, down 4 points, and September was 1.65, also down 6 points. The price of Java spot sugar was 8.1275, and the price of futures sugar for November and December was both 8.125, with no increase or decrease. The exchange market divided and planned Dutch sugar 24. The buying interest in coarse sugar white was still scarce. The initial price was 7 taels and 8 qian and a half. Demand was scarce. Later, some transactions were made at 7 taels and 8 qian. The market was still weak and lacked spirit. Ground fine sugar white was 7 taels and 8 qian and a half, and 20-count medium sugar white was 6 taels and 9 qian. Inquiries were also rare. Although transactions of Japanese sugar were scarce, the market shape was slightly flat. N Mark 7 taels 7 qian and a half, J Mark 8 taels 05 fen, SH Mark 7 taels 4 qian and a half, New Goods 7 taels 5 qian, TR Mark 7 taels 9 qian 2 fen and a half, YT Mark 7 taels 6 qian 3 fen 7 li and a half to 7 taels 6 qian and a half, YR〇 Mark 7 taels 3 qian 2 fen and a half. The trend is still firm. The dumping intentions of Dutch sugar merchants are very weak, and only Yuanji and Xiangmao foreign firms are selling, with each selling 200-300 tons. The trend is likely to show a gradual decline.</p>

<p>Recently, the number of boats arriving from the river area has become increasingly scarce. Because the outbound route is slightly better, the price of thin paddy rice temporarily rose. High-quality glutinous rice, Japonica rice, and Dujian rice all rose by 3 jiao, and the price of other types of rice also rose by nearly 1 jiao.</p>

The remaining goods were in tight supply.</p>

The date of his departure for the north is currently not yet under consideration. He came to Shanghai for medical treatment because of a relapse of the bullet wound in his lung.

<p>Shanghai Dispatch of the Den-Tsushin Agency, 6th: Acting Minister Shigemitsu spoke to reporters today regarding the current situation: "The Jiantao area has always been troubled by the instigation of communists, and the safety of the lives and property of the well-meaning Koreans residing there has often been threatened. The Longjing Village Incident occurred, and over a hundred police officers were dispatched to assist, limited to a full return to Korea on the 5th. This is due to the trust that the Chinese side has the sincerity to protect and suppress. I firmly believe that the unrest in Jiantao can be completely eliminated in the future through the sincere cooperation of both China and Japan. The meeting on the reorganization of internal and external debts will be held in Shanghai, as seen only in the newspapers, and no notice has yet been received. However, it is expected that it will be held soon. China's opening of this meeting will consolidate its financial foundation and will have a good impact on improving international credit. If Japan receives formal notice, I would be very willing to attend for the benefit of Japanese creditors."</p>

<p>To Avoid Heavy Taxes from the New Tariff</p>
<p>Many Plan to Establish Factories in Shanghai and Qingdao</p>
<p>A Tokyo dispatch from the China Mail states: "Since the implementation of China's autonomous tariff and the new tariff rules, many Japanese exporters are planning to establish factories in Shanghai and Qingdao to avoid heavy taxes and compete with Chinese factories. It is heard that the Takegawa Rubber Company, in view of the profits made by Sakata Company in manufacturing rubber galoshes in Shanghai, will soon open a branch factory in China. The aluminum ware manufacturing industry also plans to do the same, and to avoid competition among themselves, the larger manufacturers will jointly establish a factory. Its products will first be sold in China, and any surplus will be shipped to other places. Other industries will also follow suit to invade the Chinese market. The Japanese textile industry plans to expand existing factories in China because Chinese labor is cheap and silver is valuable, making it possible to operate in China. It is expected that the Chinese government will increase import duties on cotton textiles to protect its nascent industries. Manufacturing in China can avoid heavy taxes. Furthermore, China not only has low labor costs, but also reduces costs by allowing night work for twenty-two or twenty-four hours. Therefore, the Japanese textile industry advocates greatly expanding existing factories in China and uniting to become the vanguard of market invasion."</p>

<h3 id="e197">Government's Major Disaster Relief Plan <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Xu Shiying of the Relief Committee has two types of plans for disaster relief: short-term and long-term. The short-term plan involves requesting the government to allocate relief funds and for the committee to raise funds to aid various provinces affected by disasters, which is a temporary emergency measure.</p>
<p>The long-term plan is a permanent and comprehensive plan submitted by the Executive Yuan to the National Government and then sent to the Legislative Yuan for revision and approval, known as the Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Law. It has been promulgated by the National Government. The articles are recorded below:</p>
<p>Article 1: The National Government shall allocate one percent of the total regular budget revenue each year as the central disaster relief reserve fund, but it may be stopped after the accumulation of 50 million yuan.</p>
<p>Article 2: The provincial government shall allocate two percent of the total regular budget revenue each year as the provincial disaster relief reserve fund. The provincial disaster relief reserve fund shall be based on population, and may be stopped after the accumulation of 200,000 yuan for every million people. The aforementioned budget expenditure.</p>
<p>Article 3: A management committee shall be established for the disaster relief reserve fund. At the central level, it shall be organized by seven members appointed by the National Government, with the Minister of Interior and the Minister of Finance as ex officio members. At the provincial level, the committee shall be organized by five members appointed by the Executive Yuan upon request of the provincial government, with the Director of Civil Affairs and the Director of Finance as ex officio members. The central disaster relief reserve fund management committee shall be supervised by the Executive Yuan, and the provincial disaster relief reserve fund management committee shall be supervised by the provincial government in handling its affairs.</p>
<p>Article 4: The expenses of the management committee shall not be drawn from the disaster relief reserve fund.</p>
<p>Article 5: The disaster relief reserve fund shall be the responsibility of the management committee and shall not be used for other purposes.</p>
<p>Article 6: In the event of a disaster that cannot be handled by the city or county, the provincial disaster relief reserve fund shall be used for subsidies. If it is insufficient, the central disaster relief reserve fund shall be used for subsidies. Work relief or immigration related to disaster relief may be subsidized from the disaster relief reserve fund. The amount of subsidy for the preceding two items shall be decided by the management committee and submitted to the supervisory authority for approval.</p>
<p>Article 7: The disaster relief reserve fund shall be properly deposited in national banks or reliable banks and shall accrue interest on a regular basis. The aforementioned deposits shall have priority in being cleared.</p>
<p>Article 8: If the disaster relief reserve fund suffers losses due to the negligence of the custodian, the custodian shall be liable for compensation.</p>
<p>Article 9: If the interest generated by the disaster relief reserve fund in the current year is insufficient to pay due to the disaster situation, the disaster relief reserve fund may be used, but not exceeding one-half of the existing amount.</p>
<p>Article 10: The management committee shall prepare annual budgets and final accounts for the income, expenditure, and custody of the disaster relief reserve fund and report them to the supervisory authority separately.</p>
<p>Article 11: This law shall come into effect from the date of promulgation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Red Cross Society received a telegram yesterday from the Henan Provincial Relief Committee, forwarded from the Minquan County Magistrate reporting the disaster situation. The telegram reads:</p>
<p>"To the China Red Cross Society,</p>
<p>According to the report from Liu Guanzhong, the magistrate of Minquan County, the county has been in a war zone for a long time, resulting in particularly severe losses. From April to September, it was lost and recovered five times. Subsequent investigations reveal more than 330 casualties, the loss of over 1,250 large carts, more than 3,230 head of livestock, over 2,300 acres of crops trampled, over 7,200 acres of trenches dug, over 679,000 catties of grain requisitioned, over 1,830,000 catties of firewood and straw requisitioned, and other trees, beams, pillars, wooden boards, doors, and windows looted, the value of which is incalculable. At present, the war has ended, and the fields are desolate. The hungry and cold are isolated and helpless, pleading for immediate relief. Minquan is a key point on the Longhai Railway, the focus of the war, with smoke and fire filling the sky, villages turned into ruins, and fields into ravines. Corpses are everywhere, and the miserable conditions of the displaced are unbearable to witness. We earnestly pray for advance rescue and generous aid so that the survivors can preserve their lives. We are anxiously awaiting your response.</p>
<p>Zhang Fang of the Henan Relief Committee, bowing in winter."</p>
<p>Another telegram was received from the Taikang County Relief Sub-Committee, briefly stating: "Repeatedly ravaged by local bandits Liu Laosan and Zhang Fengzi, the people cannot bear their fate. By the turn of summer and autumn, rebel armies gathered, numbering over 200,000, extending from Longqu in the north to Laozhong in the south, and from Changying in the west to Zhukou in the east, covering dozens of villages and hundreds of square miles. Each household was stationed with military camps. The old and young alike were forced into service. Trenches crisscrossed, and farmland was damaged. Carts and horses were requisitioned, and farmers were unable to farm. When the national army advanced, the rebel army resisted fiercely. Airplanes soared in the sky, and bombs exploded on the ground. Although people wanted to escape, there was no way to heaven and no way to burrow into the earth. Unexpectedly, villages became targets for artillery fire, and houses became targets for airplanes. With a deafening crash, several zhang of red smoke arose, and houses were reduced to ashes. People were turned into minced meat. Such tragic scenes are common in areas close to the front lines. Those families who were fortunate enough not to be hit by bombs still had their food, clothing, and livestock looted by the rebel army, leaving nothing behind. Even chickens, dogs, sheep, and pigs were slaughtered, and there were no remaining pieces of furniture or utensils to be used as fuel. Nevertheless, they still forcibly levied donations of over 200,000 yuan, requisitioned over 30 million catties of wheat, and requisitioned bran and firewood accordingly, conscripting four to five thousand soldiers and over ten thousand laborers. Those who escaped death from bombs will inevitably succumb to freezing and starvation. The continuous war has lasted for seven months. At the time of the rebel army's collapse, banditry spread everywhere, and the misery of arson and slaughter was unprecedented. Today, all that is seen are red walls standing, rubble piled up, the smell of blood but no smoke from cooking. The disaster victims are anxious and miserable, with suffering too difficult to bear, eating in the wind and sleeping in the dew, and with whom can their grievances be told? Their mournful cries shake the sky, and they are crying out for food, waiting for relief.</p>
<p>The Red Cross has repeatedly received disaster reports from various parts of Henan Province and is actively raising funds to prepare for winter relief."</p>

<p>Various shipping companies traveling on the Pacific route, due to the high value of gold and the low value of silver, and the soaring freight rates, but also due to the small amount of cargo and intense competition, organized the Pacific Freight Alliance in this city in mid-July. After a few months of trial operation, due to operational reasons and mutual misunderstanding, it has been decided to dissolve the alliance after the trial period has ended.</p>

<p>The Baihe River is Open, Blocking Ships: This year, the Baihe River waterway opened earlier. A few days ago, a hurricane caused twenty-six or seven ships bound for Tianjin to be blocked at the Dagukou and unable to enter. Passengers and cargo were transferred to small boats. Yesterday, news from Tianjin stated that the commercial ships stopped at Tanggu had resumed sailing successively because the wind had stopped. However, it was no longer possible for ships with deeper drafts to enter Zizhu Forest, so passengers disembarked in Tanggu.</p>
<p>Tianjin Maru Has Been Stopped for Repairs: The Dalian Steamship Company's Tianjin Maru collided with the Osaka Steamship Company's Wuchang Maru at the port of Tianjin. The Tianjin Maru suffered serious damage to its hull and has been suspended from service for repairs. The cost of repairs is estimated to be about 10,000 taels. It will resume sailing to Shanghai after the repairs are completed.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Overview of the Business Operations of the Upper Yangtze Shipping Company's Vessels in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Aviation Compete with Each Other</p>
<p>This year, the Yangtze River shipping industry has been affected by the current situation, and imports and exports have been sluggish. Recently, due to the accumulation of goods in Jiangxi Province, cargo is being shipped downstream from the upper reaches in large quantities. The various steamships in Shanghai have been competing fiercely for business on the Yangtze River. What I know is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Taikoo Company: The British Taikoo Company has the most ships and the largest tonnage in the Yangtze River. It has always been the leader among the six companies in terms of upstream and downstream business. This year, the company's Yangtze River business is not as good as before, with a particular shortage of local goods. Fortunately, there are more transshipment goods from the South and North Oceans. However, it has retreated behind Japanese ships in terms of business. It is said that since February, income and expenditure have not been able to offset each other. Fortunately, the accumulated profits are huge, and there is no loss. The company's focus has shifted to the upper reaches, starting with extending the routes of Anqing, Datong, and Poyang ships to Yichang. Then, new oil-powered ships were added, specializing in the Shanghai-Yichang route. At the same time, the upstream shipping rates were reduced, and business improved slightly. On the upstream route, the number of cargo pieces on the Hankou route is not as good as the number of cargo pieces on the Yichang route, with each ship exporting only three to four thousand pieces on average.</p>
<p>Nisshin Kisen Kaisha: The Nisshin Kisen Kaisha originally specialized in coal routes. After increasing the number of ships on the North and South Oceans and foreign seas, the amount of transshipment cargo has also increased significantly. This year, all the Yangtze River vessels are in decline, but the export cargo of this company can still maintain sixty to seventy percent. The most profitable cargo, yarn cloth, accounts for the largest share among the six companies. Recently, it has even begun to seize the cigarette transport business that Jardine Matheson exclusively handles, so the cargo on each ship is often more than on other ships. It is very accommodating to the brokers, giving rebates and gifts. As a result, its business is better than other companies. Currently, there are six Yangtze River vessels per week and one Yichang vessel every other day. Because the upper reaches can be loaded, large quantities of rapeseed, wheat bran, cotton seed, and other goods are being transported to the East from Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui. The Yangtze River imports and exports of this company have already jumped to first place this year.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson: Jardine Matheson's Yangtze River vessels are also very sluggish this year. However, the Yichang vessel once a week still has good cargo, so the newly built ship, Shihe, can start sailing this month. Recently, export cargo is not as good as downstream cargo, with only five sailings per week. The exclusive transport of cash and large quantities of kerosene belongs to this company. The Mingsheng, a "wild chicken" vessel on the Yangtze River route, has already been sold.</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: China Merchants' Yangtze River business has been severely hit this year due to too many vessel suspensions and schedule disruptions. However, vessels can be gradually returned to service this week, and the regular schedule is expected to resume from next week. Recently, the company's export cargo has seen a sudden increase. The cargo of large ships on the one-four schedule has always been around 10,000 taels. Even the Jiangyu, a small ship that sailed yesterday, received more than 7,000 taels. Now it is just beginning to reorganize. If it can fully recover, it should be able to surpass the British and Japanese vessels. The company has exclusive transport rights to Datong, Anqing, and other ports, and foreign vessels cannot compete.</p>
<p>San Peh Steam Navigation Company: San Peh's Yangtze River vessels were also suspended this year. This month, vessels such as Xinning, Xingguang, Hongyuan, and Hongheng have started sailing. The newly built 700-ton Hong-class vessel will also be able to start sailing soon. Recently, because the accumulated cargo in Shashi and Jiujiang in the upper reaches has begun to be loaded in Shanghai, the company specially ordered the iron barges in the upper Yangtze to carry downstream cargo to Shanghai and Hankou because of the insufficient number of vessels.</p>
<p>Ning Shao and Zhaoxing: The Ning Shao Company is still dispatching the old Ning Shao vessel. The newly purchased Ning Jing vessel is currently chartered out and cannot be dispatched for the time being. The Zhaoxing Company's Yangtze River vessels are currently the Zhaoxing and Rongxing vessels. However, they only dock at Wuhu and Xunyang along the way, so the cargo loaded is only sugar and iron. There is no transshipment business, so it seems difficult to compete with other companies.</p>
<p>Jiejiang Xiangtai: The Jiejiang Company is a US-owned company that specializes in the upper reaches. It currently has four Shanghai-Yichang vessels and four Chongqing vessels. The export business is still considered good, with about 60% cargo per sailing. However, recently, the freight rates in the upper reaches have been affected by the drastic price cuts of British and Japanese vessels. The Xiangtai vessel is a British vessel that initially specialized in transporting its own timber, but now it also transports passengers and cargo. There are a total of two vessels in service. In total, the nine Yangtze River companies have eighty-seven vessels on the upstream and downstream routes.</p>
<h3 id="e202">County-Owned Inland River Vessels Registered in Accordance with Regulations <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>In order to develop transportation and protect shipping vessels, the Construction Bureau of Shanghai County has drafted provisional regulations for the registration of inland river vessels, which have been submitted to the county government meeting for revision and approval. The various shipping companies within the county are ordered to register within a limited time. It is known that the various shipping companies, such as Minnan, Pinghu, Lixing, and Huzhang, have submitted lists of their respective vessels and applied for registration. Director Wu, in addition to dispatching Section Chief Gong of the Technical Department to investigate, will issue registration certificates. It is also heard that the bureau fears that there may be omissions and has extended the deadline by ten days, so all companies must register with the bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Year-End Bonuses for Staff on the Two Railroad Lines <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Expected to be Issued at the Same Level as Last Year</p>
<p>The Jinghu and Hangyong Railway Bureaus have traditionally issued a month's salary as a bonus to diligent staff members at the end of each year to show encouragement. Last year, the revenue of the railroad was better than in previous years due to Minister Sun's efforts to reorganize. The staff then requested to be given double the bonus. This was approved by the ministry, and a decree was issued at the same time stipulating that the issuance of bonuses must be based on revenue. It is now known that the revenue of the railroad has increased even more this year, so the railroad is currently compiling a list to be submitted to Minister Sun for instructions. It is expected that the bonus will be issued at the same level as last year.</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Industry Maintenance Regulations Committee Held Its Third Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The Industry Maintenance Regulations Committee, organized by the various industry trade associations in the city, held its third committee meeting yesterday. Chairman Ye Jiaxing resolved the following motions:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the motion on how to send representatives to Beijing to petition for the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session, it was resolved that the entire committee would travel to Beijing on the night train on the 11th to petition.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the proposal by Zhang Dalian, the representative of the Soy Sauce and Wine Shops, to collect the industry regulations of various industries for a meeting and discussion, it was resolved to retain it.</p>
<p>(3) Wang Yan Song, a member of the committee, strongly advocated for industry regulations at the Industrial and Commercial Conference in Beijing and is scheduled to return to Shanghai tomorrow. Regarding whether to prepare a welcome ceremony, it was resolved that the entire committee would go to the station to welcome him.</p>
<p>The meeting was adjourned after the resolutions were passed.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Membership Withdrawal from Trade Associations <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Approved by the Ministry: Pass by the Executive Committee First</p>
<p>Then Submitted to the General Assembly for Retroactive Approval</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to various industry trade associations yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>"Regarding the case where the Shanghai Silk Trade Association previously stated that Article 7 of the trade association's constitution stipulated, 'Members who wish to withdraw from the association must submit a written statement stating the reasons, which must be approved by a majority vote of the general membership before they can withdraw.' They believed that the general membership meeting was held once a year, and members requesting withdrawal was a common occurrence, making it difficult to handle according to the regulations. Therefore, they proposed a flexible approach: first, the executive committee would resolve the matter, and then the new member would be retroactively approved, and the matter would be reported for review.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce believed that this restriction was a provision of the association's constitution, and there was no explicit provision in the Trade Association Law and its implementation rules. The flexible approach proposed by the trade association could be resolved by amending Article 7 of the association's constitution at the next general membership meeting. However, before Article 7 of the constitution has been resolved and amended, could the flexible approach be implemented first? The matter was submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for review.</p>
<p>Now, we have received Instruction No. 2899 from the Social Affairs Bureau on the 5th of this month, stating that, 'The association submitted a case requesting instructions on whether the withdrawal of association members could be resolved by the executive committee first and then submitted to the general meeting for retroactive approval. We have forwarded the case and made the following instructions: We have received Consultation No. 13066 from the Municipal Government's Bureau of Industry and Commerce, stating that there are no other restrictions on the withdrawal of members from the industry trade association except that Article 5 of this law stipulates that it should be stated in the constitution. As for ceasing business or changing industries, which results in the elimination of qualifications, the membership is naturally lost even without the approval of the general membership meeting. It is permissible to ratify it at the next general membership meeting. We hereby order you to inform them.'</p>
<p>Therefore, it is appropriate to order the association to inform them. Upon arrival at the meeting, it was found that the stipulation that membership withdrawal must be resolved by the general membership meeting was similar to this in the constitutions of various industry trade associations in the city. Therefore, the difficult situation mentioned by the Silk Trade Association is not unique to that industry. Due to the urgent nature of the order, we are hereby issuing a letter to notify various trade associations to comply, and at the same time, we will wait until the next general membership meeting to amend Article 7 of the constitution in accordance with the Ministry's instructions."</p>
<p>County Clean-Up Committee Meeting</p>
<p>59th Session</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Affairs Clean-Up Committee held its 59th committee meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday, presided over by Tao Yishan. After the usual proceedings, the report on matters was omitted.</p>
<p>The discussion items proceeded:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the request from the Jiangyin County Clean-Up Committee for a unanimous effort to clean up the corruption in China's finances, the committee resolved to recommend it to the central government.</p>
<p>(2) The Organization Department proposed to conduct an individual survey of all party members in the county in preparation for undertaking the work of the deputy sub-district party district. The survey methods and forms have been drafted by the department. The committee resolved to pass the proposal and set the survey to begin on the tenth of this month.</p>
<p>(3) Omitted</p>
<p>(4) The Organization Department proposed that the department's work plan outline has been drafted and requested review and approval. The committee resolved to revise and approve it.</p>
<p>(5) The Organization Department proposed that Peng Yongquan, the custodian of the First District Party Department, has submitted his resignation and requested retention. The committee resolved to approve it.</p>
<p>(6) Omitted</p>
<p>(7) Omitted</p>
<p>The meeting was adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<p>The Jiangbei Agricultural Inspection Sub-Station Inspects Cotton Production</p>
<p>Reported to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, the Achievements of the Past Year</p>
<p>The Cotton Trade Associations of Jiangbei, Qihai, and other places believe that the Jiangbei Sub-Station of the Agricultural Inspection Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining has gradually shown results in inspecting cotton production since it was established last winter. Yesterday, they jointly presented a report to Minister Yi of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining. The main points of the report are that the quality of the cotton produced in Xiasha has always been low, and the practice of adulteration has been prevalent, so the price has always been lower than that of ordinary cotton. Recently, due to strict inspection, accumulated abuses have gradually been eliminated, the market has gradually gained credibility, and the price has also increased accordingly, which has benefited farmers and merchants, which is by no means insignificant.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Japan Promotes the Advantages of Japanese Silk <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>The Silk Trade Association Raises 500,000 Yuan for Promotion Expenses</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's Silk Inspection Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce recently received reliable information that the Japanese Silk Association has noted that American women's purchases of silk fabrics have gradually trended towards artificial silk fabrics. This is due to the low price of artificial silk and the powerful promotional efforts. The association has passed a resolution to collect one Japanese yen for each export of raw silk, which can generate 500,000 yuan annually to promote the advantages of Japanese silk. According to Director Miao Zhongxiu, the plan was initially launched by Mr. Sant, the secretary of the Heineman Spinning Mill in Chicago, USA, who plans to hold silk exhibitions in various cities and towns in the United States to promote the advantages of natural silk in various ways, and to distinguish between natural silk and artificial silk, so that the public can choose correctly. This move is a major competition between natural silk and artificial silk, and silk-producing countries around the world should join together.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Postal Administration Received Two Orders from the Ministry of Communications <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Cancellation of Rice Subsidies for Postal Workers</p>
<p>Switch to Domestically Produced Mailbags</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Postal Administration of this Ministry received two important orders from the Ministry of Communications, which are hereby recorded separately:</p>
<p>Cancellation of Rice Subsidies for Postal Workers: Order received regarding the case. It has been found that due to the high price of rice in Shanghai in the past, this Ministry, recognizing the difficulties in the lives of low-level postal workers, had issued instructions to subsidize the rice prices for these employees. However, this was a temporary measure and not a permanent one. Now that the price of rice in Shanghai has plummeted, this rice subsidy for low-level employees should be revoked to save national currency. The Postal Administration is hereby ordered to comply immediately and instruct its subordinates to be informed. This order is to be strictly followed.</p>
<p>Switch to Domestically Produced Mailbags: It has been found that each postal district requires the purchase of over fifty to sixty thousand canvas mailbags annually. However, the materials for these mailbags have traditionally been purchased from foreign countries, which is not only more expensive than domestic products but also results in a staggering amount of Chinese money flowing abroad each year. At a time when promoting domestic goods is encouraged, these mailbags should be switched to domestically produced materials. Domestically produced canvas is durable, resistant to water penetration, and suitable for making these mailbags. Therefore, the Postal Administration is hereby ordered that, starting this year, all mailbags purchased in the future must be made of domestically produced canvas and that foreign goods must no longer be used to prevent financial leakage and to demonstrate the promotion of domestic products. This order is to be strictly followed.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Workers at the Yingchang Factory Demand Severance Pay <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The merger of the Yingchang Match Factory in Pudong Lujiazui with the Dachunghua Match Company has sparked a backlash from all workers, who have specifically demanded severance pay from the company that each worker is legally entitled to upon leaving the Yingchang Factory. Negotiations have been ongoing for some time, and although the Social Affairs Bureau mediated, the company requested arbitration from the Municipal Government. The outcome, rejecting the workers' demands, was decided and delivered to both labor and management the day before yesterday for compliance. After receiving the decision, the Yingchang Match Workers' Union immediately issued a notice to the workers, stating briefly: "Now that the severance pay issue has been decided by the Municipal Government, we hope that all workers will remain calm and continue working. Obey the government's orders and avoid making unnecessary moves." However, upon seeing the notice, the workers expressed dissatisfaction at not achieving their goals. The Municipal Government's arbitration decision is transcribed below: (Main text) The request by the labor side to issue severance pay is rejected. (Reason) According to the regulations, severance pay is provided to treat retiring employees with consideration. Article 1 of the Provisional Measures for Employee Severance Pay states that the regulations apply when employers in industry and commerce terminate employment relationships with employees. If there is no termination of employment between labor and management, the issue of severance pay will not arise. In this case, the labor representative claimed that the Yingchang Factory had been operating for nineteen years, the factory's capital had increased year by year, and the scope of business had expanded successively. The workers had made efforts during this time and had contributed labor. Now that the factory has closed and been merged, with the managers of the Dachunghua Company replacing the factory director and manager, the workers' side should also come to an end. Therefore, they requested the company to issue severance pay. The company representative stated that the Dachunghua Match Company merged with the Yingchang Factory, inheriting all rights and obligations of Yingchang. The company had already announced that the employment contracts and treatment conditions for the original workers of Yingchang Factory would continue to be valid. Although the company underwent restructuring, the labor side was not affected in any way. In terms of severance pay, whether or not it should be issued depends on whether there is a dismissal. Currently, the company has not dismissed anyone, and the workers have not requested dismissal. They only claim that because it is the end of the Yingchang factory, the employees have the right to enjoy severance pay in advance, which is not legally justified, and the company finds it difficult to comply with this request. After reviewing the statements from both sides, although the name of the Yingchang Match Factory has been eliminated due to the merger, the Dachunghua Company should inherit all obligations of the factory. In other words, all rights that the workers had under their contracts with the Yingchang Factory still exist as before, and their years of service will not be lost due to the company's merger, thus affecting the amount of legal severance pay they will receive in the future. Therefore, the request for severance pay for the Yingchang workers who have not been dismissed at present is not justified. Furthermore, after reviewing the regulations listed in the Measures for Employee Severance Pay, items 2, 3, and 2 state that severance pay must be issued when an employee is dismissed due to old age or disability; item 6 states that severance pay must be issued when the employer reduces the scope of employment or changes the business direction; and item 8 states that severance pay should be given based on financial resources when the employer ceases operations and dismisses employees. Although the circumstances for granting severance pay vary, the separation of the employment relationship is consistent with the actual facts of this case. The request to issue severance pay should be rejected according to law. After unanimous deliberation by all committee members, a decision is made as per the main text (omitted below).</p>
<h3 id="e213">Fuan Company Opened Yesterday <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>

Customers were already waiting outside the door as early as seven or eight o'clock in the morning, and when it opened, they rushed in, with hardly any room to stand inside. On that day, over 60,000 yuan in silver was sold, which shows how grand the opening was. It is also reported that Yang Jiezhou, who was elected as a director of the company, has applied to resign, and Yang Shaochen will fill the position.</p>

<p>The Tobacco Exchange Industry Tobacco Exchange Industry Association is currently planning to investigate, register, and crack down on unofficial tradesmen. It is now sending volunteer investigators to handle the matter separately. Yesterday, a letter to the members stated that: "The tradesmen are reporting that competition among the tradesmen is intensifying, and there are also private promoters mingling among them. They are setting up tobacco exchange and grocery stores to lure young people into smoking opium, laughing and joking, and then gathering to gamble and draw profits from lotteries. They specialize in purchasing private goods, Chang brand cigarettes, counterfeit money, and inferior goods. They deliberately hang up signs with cheap prices to deceive customers, which is not proper. They are destroying the reputation of the tradesmen, poisoning society, harming the tradesmen, and hindering both labor and management, and the harm is not small. There should be a thorough investigation, separate registration, and if there are deliberate violations, a list should be made and reported to the association for submission to the authorities of the Chinese Concession for strict prohibition to prevent disturbance, maintain business, and maintain livelihoods." It has been learned that self-disturbance among the tradesmen affects the overall situation, and those with secret tradesmen or improper conduct should be investigated to clarify the facts and submit a request to the authorities for prohibition and strict legal action in order to prevent disturbance and protect business operations. Therefore, specially prepared procedures are enclosed and attached with the letter, and it is hoped that you will investigate and handle the matter accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="e224">Second Chrysanthemum Exhibition Opens at the Social Affairs Bureau Garden <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Lunch Gathering on the Ninth</p>
<p>The flower show at the Municipal Garden has been fully prepared and opened for viewing today. This year, more chrysanthemums have been planted in the park than last year, with a total of more than 6,000 pots. In addition to the original varieties, this year, new species have been exchanged, collected, sorted, and analyzed from famous gardens in the capital, Yangzhou, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, totaling 267 varieties. No fewer than three to four hundred species have been contributed by all sectors. Famous gardens in this city, such as the Huang family's breeding farm, Sanyou Industrial Society, Xiaoguan Garden, Shen Xingyuan, Public School Garden, Guansheng Agricultural Farm, China Products Garden, Lu Yongmao Garden, Jiazi School Garden, Bansong Garden, Yongchun Garden, Jinan University, Labor University, and members of the Horticultural Tree Trade Association, have all selected and displayed their famous species and unseen new species, which can be called the grandest exhibition of the time. At noon on the 9th, there will also be a grand gathering for people from the Municipal Government. The Municipal Public Works Bureau has specially sold half-price group round-trip tickets for groups of five or more and printed beautiful publications with the theme of "Go to Pudong" to give away. A small notice about chrysanthemum appreciation is recorded as follows: "The autumn is waning, and the autumn light is fading. Where can we send our refined feelings if there is no place of interest? Now, the Pudong Municipal Garden is located in the East Ditch Field, and the North Garden has been operated with painstaking efforts, with the intention of combining art creation with the enjoyment of the people. The square pond and winding water show a little ingenuity, and the bamboo houses and thatched pavilions contain elegant charm. The strands of fountains wash away ten thousand barrels of vulgarity, and the wisps of weeping willows recall the scenery of spring. Recently, chrysanthemums have been in full bloom, and the grand event has been re-organized. The autumn flowers of each garden are gathered, and the fine species in this garden are even more numerous. The purple and red are bright and dazzling, and the frost-resistant and cold-resistant are light and pleasant. The hermits drink the wine of yellow flowers, and the poets compose poems of red leaves. Everything from a grass to a tree, from a mound to a gully, is like visiting the Pingquan Villa and viewing the Sichuan painting. It is truly that we should only be able to have such a place on earth. If you allow yourself to visit, you will believe that the autumn is not pale. If you are willing to choose and buy, you can buy the autumn color. We will sweep the path and wait, lest the lonely fragrance appreciate itself. Let us go together far away, how can we not welcome you sincerely?"</p>
<p>Those Redeeming Tickets Were Detained by Pirates</p>
<p>The Rampancy of Pirates is Generally Visible</p>
<p>Wang Buxian's Two Sons Were Both Kidnapped</p>
<p>Wang Buxian, the head of Ruifengsha Township outside Wusongkou, and his son were previously kidnapped by Jiang Xingsha, the leader of the water police squad stationed near the sandbar, and Chen Guoliang, the squad leader of the 17th team of the 4th district of the Wusong water police, who were colluding with bandits. Wang took advantage of the opportunity to escape, while his son was held for ransom by the bandits for 1,500 yuan. It was reported in this newspaper that Wang's youngest son, Yulin, is still in the bandit's den and has not been released. The other day, Wang sent his eldest son, Yu'ao, with 1,000 yuan to the bandit's den in Lvsi to redeem his younger brother. Unexpectedly, after Yu'ao arrived at the bandit's den, the bandits said that the ransom was only 1,000 yuan, claiming that Wang was not sincere enough, and detained Wang Yu'ao in the bandit's den as well. Yesterday, a letter was sent to Wang, demanding a very harsh price. Wang was greatly shocked after receiving the letter because the incident was unexpected. He has already sent someone to try to rescue them.</p>
<p>Wang and Kang Sentenced in Scandalous Intercourse Case</p>
<p>The Reporting Mother and Son Blamed Each Other</p>
<p>Common Illegal Restriction of Personal Liberty</p>
<p>Threatening Extortion Attempted and Other Crimes</p>
<p>Wang Sentenced to Three Months, Kang to Two Months</p>
<p>In the case of Luo Wang's daughter, Yuying (also known as Lin Mei), a Ningbo woman from 511 Yuanjili, Tangshan Road, who is in her early twenties and has been promised in marriage to someone, Yuying suddenly had a relationship with Tang Yueqing, who lived at 412 Broadway Road. On August 17, Yuying secretly fled with her mother. Her mother and brother, Yuqing, found Yuying and Yueqing at the Suzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road on the evening of the 21st of last month and were preparing to order them to return home when Wang Zhuqing, claiming to be a detective from the 49th branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and his partner, Kang Jiabing, gathered many hooligans and took Tang Yueqing, Luo Yuying, and others to two rooms, numbers 23 and 39, at the Nanjing Hotel in the French Concession, where they were held incommunicado overnight, intending to extort 700 yuan. The case was logged in this paper. Yesterday morning, the case was re-examined in the first criminal court by Court President Xu Jiashi and Prosecutor Xu Mei of the Special Court, with the first to be summoned being Luo Yuqing, who stood in the witness box. The prosecutor's lawyer, Ru Bao-yi, said to him that after investigating the previous testimony of your confession, there were many inconsistencies with the facts, so today you must state the real language truthfully. Court President Xu then asked Luo when he reported to the Public Security Bureau after your sister disappeared. He replied that it was his mother who reported. The lawyer asked that his mother said that he made the report. The lawyer replied that he made the report to the patrol room, and his mother reported to the Public Security Bureau. The lawyer asked who Wang Yunqing and Wang A'mao were. He replied that he did not know the two people. The lawyer asked him why he said in his previous testimony that the room in Nanjing Hotel was opened by his friend. It has been found that the room was opened by the two Wangs, which is obviously inconsistent. He replied that the room was actually opened by Tang Yueqing's friend. He was asked whether he could change the testimony today. He replied that the room was actually opened by Tang's friend, and he asked that it be changed on the record. He was asked who Wang Zhuqing was and ordered him to come out. He replied that he did not know. He was asked how many people were guarding Tang Yueqing. He replied that no one was guarding him. He was asked if Wang Zhuqing was called by him. He said no. Most of the rest of the testimony contradicted the testimony given during the previous court hearing. Then, according to Tang Yueqing's testimony, the Nanjing Hotel was not opened by my friend but by Wang Zhuqing and Luo Yuqing, and Wang Zhuqing said the words "one thousand yuan" to me, and he said that he would have at least 700 yuan to settle the matter. Xu then summoned Luo Yuying to the case to ask her what she had said the last time. They first needed 1,000 yuan, but after asking for it, it was reduced to 700 yuan. According to the reply, she could not recognize who she was asking for help at the time because there were so many people, but she heard them say that if they got the money, they would have double hats (ie, 20% commission) to take. Lawyer Ru Bao-yi immediately requested that the report form submitted by the plaintiff to the Public Security Bureau be issued, and then asked the detective Qiu Si-jiu where this form came from. He replied that it was brought by the defendant Wang Zhuqing and another detective. Then he asked Luo Yuqing whether her sister needed a marriage gift to marry Tang. He replied that Tang was willing to pay 700 yuan, with 300 yuan to settle the matter with Yuying's former fiance's family and 400 yuan as a bride price. The lawyer Ru asked Tang Yueqing if he completely denied the points of Luo Yuqing's testimony, and he also asked Wang Zhuqing where the report paper came from. He replied that the plaintiff sent it to the Public Security Bureau, and he asked if it was a forgery. If this happened, please deal with it according to the law, etc. At this point, the court ordered the debate to begin. The lawyer Ru said that the testimonies of the plaintiff Luo Wang and her son Luo Yuqing contradicted each other. In other words, on the point of reporting to the Public Security Bureau, the mother pushed her son to report, and the son pushed his mother to report. In fact, neither of them had reported. Moreover, the plaintiff Luo Wang lived in the concession, and her daughter also ran away in the concession. Anyone living in the concession must know that he must report to the patrol room. The plaintiff abandoned the near and took the far, but went to report to the Public Security Bureau. There is no such foolish person in the world. From this point of view, it can be seen that the plaintiff did not actually report to the bureau, then where did this report form come from? It must be that the defendant Wang Zhuqing saw that the matter had been defeated, so he tried to forge it. If the forgery is true, then the defendant's claim that he was ordered by his superiors to investigate this case is also fabricated. Even if what he said is true, when Luo and others were found in the Suzhou Hotel, why didn't he report to the patrol room by phone and ask for help, but instead took the plaintiff to the Nanjing Hotel in the French Concession? Didn't Wang Zhuqing know the public affairs procedures? According to this lawyer's speculation, his changing hotels was indeed for criminal purposes. The Patrol Room is now accusing the two defendants of threatening extortion and obstructing freedom, and they should be severely punished. Under the vigorous defense of the defendant's lawyer Fan Gang, Court President Xu then announced in court that Wang Zhuqing had illegally restricted other people's freedom and attempted extortion, and was sentenced to three months of fixed-term imprisonment, and Kang Jiabing was sentenced to two months of fixed-term imprisonment for the same crime. The number of days of detention was converted into one day of imprisonment for every two days.</p>

Because the matter is handled properly, everyone is mindful of discipline, both in and out of the camp. All camp arrangements, military supplies, and uniforms are meticulously organized and clean to set an example of military preparedness. Furthermore, members' leaves have been suspended to ensure full attendance. It is also heard that Mr. Abenheim, the Commander-in-Chief of the Corps, will arrive on the afternoon of the 9th to present awards from last year and invite dignitaries from all walks of life and family members of the officers to visit the camp.

<p>Greyhound Racing Track's Life Coming to an End</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Discusses Aftermath</p>
<p>Elimination Only a Matter of Time</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession held a board meeting yesterday afternoon. The official announcement was not made until last night, but according to private sources, most of the directors from various countries opposed the existence of the greyhound racing track. However, the aftermath of the greyhound racing track and the shareholders' investments still need to be discussed in detail to find a perfect solution. Therefore, the elimination of the greyhound racing track is a confirmed fact. However, the British Consul and the Municipal Council authorities still need to help plan the aftermath, and the Municipal Council Board must continue to meet several times to resolve this issue. In short, the elimination of the greyhound racing track is only a matter of time.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Plan to Move Greyhound Track North <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Dalian or Liaoning</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a high outcry for the Public Concession to abolish the greyhound racing track, causing the stock prices of Shen Garden and Ming Garden to plummet. Those in charge also know that their days are numbered and are eager to plan for the aftermath. According to reliable sources, a businessman from Dalian recently came to Shanghai and is discussing conditions with the people in charge of the greyhound racing track, planning to move the racing track within the concession to the north for business. In the future, they will first open a track in Dalian or set up a branch in Liaoning, and then expand to Tianjin and other places. They have been secretly working on this for days. If the concession authorities formally announce the abolition of the greyhound racing track, this plan will definitely be realized.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Extension of Daytime Electricity Supply in Jiajiajiao, Pudong <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Since the Pudong Electric Company started providing daytime electricity, general users have found it convenient. However, Jiajiajiao, located between Shiba Jian and Yangjing Town, is in a remote area with very little electricity consumption, and daytime electricity has not yet been connected. Recently, businesses such as Jia Sentai and Jia Ruitai in the area felt unfairly treated for not having access to daytime electricity and filed a complaint through the Fifth District Party Headquarters to the Municipal Public Works Bureau for handling. The bureau ordered the company to provide daytime electricity to the area or to advance the current evening electricity supply time and extend it to meet the needs. It is now learned that the company believes there is no need to provide daytime electricity in the area and has complied by advancing the turn-on time of the time switches installed in the area and delaying the power outage in the morning.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Reorganization of the Huxi Defense Corps <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>The original 13th Branch of the Huxi Fahua District Defense Corps had six sub-teams: one team in Fahua Town, one team in Qianjia Lane, one team in Panjia Ku, one team in Wujia Jiao, one team in Caojiadu, and one team in Xujiahui. The number of members in each team varied, and the number of firearms in each team was also lacking and insufficient for use. Among the teams, the Caojiadu and Xujiahui teams performed the best. Now that the Defense Corps Reorganization Committee has been established, it has ordered the defense corps in each district to be reorganized, stipulating that each corps be reorganized into three teams, each with 108 members, one team leader and two deputy team leaders. The Huxi area should still be organized into one corps, with one team established in Fahua Township, one team established in Xujiahui, and one team established in Caojiadu. Since receiving the order, the corps has been reorganized. It was originally intended to complete the reorganization as soon as possible, but it was delayed due to insufficient manpower in Fahua Township. However, Caojiadu and Xujiahui have filled their quotas. Now that each district has been reorganized and winter defense is imminent, it is necessary to start immediately and reorganize and establish the corps immediately. Therefore, each team is currently engaged in merging and supplementing, and it is expected that it will be officially established soon.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee's Mass Training Committee recently received a request from citizens such as Chen Li Zhi to establish a labor camp for vagrants and asked for permission. After receiving the request, the committee believed that although this charitable undertaking was important, the Shanghai Municipal Government already had the Songhu Rehabilitation Institute, and there was no need to establish another one. Yesterday, it specifically ordered that the request be denied.</p>

<p>The Minhang Guangci Orphanage was founded by major philanthropists and has a history of more than ten years. It is now known that the orphanage accommodates no fewer than 200 orphans, providing both education and care, which costs a great deal. Furthermore, due to insufficient buildings, it is planned to expand the orphanage. Taking advantage of the chrysanthemum exhibition, a general meeting will be held as usual to entertain guests and raise funds. It is heard that a preparatory meeting has been held to assign staff. The date of the meeting and the entertainment program will be announced later.</p>

<p>The Engineering Department of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Bureau in Zhejiang Province needs 3,000 workers to build roads such as the Xiaochang Road. After recruiting workers in Liaoning and Tianjin, the first, second, and third batches of workers, totaling more than 1,050, have arrived in Shanghai from Yingkou to be transferred to Hangzhou for work. Yesterday, the fourth batch of workers, totaling 178, led by the foreman Hua Baoming, arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin after being recruited. They traveled to Yingkou by the Heshun ship and then transferred to the Yuxing ship. They arrived in Shanghai at 2:00 PM yesterday. At 4:30 PM, the Nan Railway Station prepared four carriages attached to the 28th night freight train to Hangzhou, which departed at 9:35 PM last night. It is heard that the fifth batch of workers, totaling 500, is scheduled to pass through Shanghai to Hangzhou next Thursday.</p>

<p>Encountered Adulterer Shan Xiaoxiong on the Road</p>
<p>Zhang Linfei, a lacquer worker from Pudong, is nearly thirty years old and still lives in poverty. Therefore, he searched everywhere for a good match as his wife. In September of this year, Mrs. Chen, who lives on Gonghe Xin Road, acted as a matchmaker, saying that her niece Chen Jindi, 22 years old, was a new widow who was seeking</p>
<p>Xiang Ru. The wealth and betrothal gifts were not a concern. At that time, both parties looked at each other and were both in their youth, so the matter was settled. The wealth and betrothal gifts only cost seventy-six yuan, and they immediately moved in together. On the third day of their wedding, a man suddenly came to visit, claiming to be Chen Xiaoxiong, Chen Jindi's brother. Zhang did not suspect him. Therefore, he came and went every day as if it were his own family. In fact, his real name was Shan Xiaoxiong, and he was Jindi's lover. He took this opportunity to continue their relationship. Zhang was still in the dark. However, the second landlord Jiang Hengdao was not deaf and had already learned the truth, but he did not interfere because it was none of his business. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday, Jindi took seven pieces of clothing and twenty yuan in cash and ran away without a trace. Shan also disappeared. At the same time, Chen also moved away. Zhang lost both his wife and money, and the marriage, which lasted only two months, ended in a dream. He knew he had been deceived by a white pigeon. However, this white pigeon's design was to bring the adulterer into the home. He was deceiving people too much, so he searched everywhere. Yesterday, he encountered Shan Xiaoxiong on the road. The enemies met on a narrow road, and he brought him to the Second Section of the Fifth District and transferred him to the Local Court for questioning.</p>
<p>The Dispute over the Qiao Family Ancestral Temple</p>
<p>Qiao Yutang, a native of this county, currently residing at No. 67 Ju Men Road, Xieqiao, recently hired lawyer Jin Hongji to sue the woman Cao for illegally adopting a son-in-law to inherit the family lineage in the Local Court. He requested the court to investigate and make a fair judgment in accordance with the law to maintain the family lineage and avoid the chaos of a different surname inheriting the family line. He claimed that Qiao Yutang's ancestor, Duke Peilong, had two sons, the eldest being his late father, Guiqi, and the second being his late uncle, Guilin, dividing into two branches. Guiqi had two sons, the eldest being Atang and the second being the plaintiff Yutang. Atang also had two sons, the eldest being Rongsheng and the second being Linsheng (who had been adopted into the Zhang family). Yutang had two sons, Jingen and Wenbao. The second branch, Guilin, only had one son, Gengyu (Yutang's cousin). He lived with Cao (the defendant) as his wife for ten years and had no children. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, he adopted a daughter from the Zhu family in Lujiiawan, naming her Zhuying. Unfortunately, Gengyu died on July 21 of this year. The defendant unexpectedly recruited Gong Meisheng, Zhuying's fiancé, as an adopted son-in-law, naming him Jinde to inherit the Qiao family lineage. This time, after Gengyu's death, he used the name of the adopted son to issue a funeral announcement, excluding the uncles and nephews of the clan. He not only disregarded the ancestral temple but also violated the current laws. The most illegal thing was the pre-written will. On July 21 of this year, it was reported that lawyer Ye Fukang certified the will established by Qiao Gengyu and Qiao Cao, which was shocking. Gengyu died on July 21. It is questionable whether the will was established by Gengyu. Moreover, Qiao Gengyu had no children during his lifetime. According to current laws, those without sons are allowed to inherit from nephews of the same clan and generation. Therefore, Yutang's second son, Wenbao, should inherit the family lineage. Please make a fair judgment in accordance with the law, he said. The defendant Qiao Cao also filed a defense, saying that this will was certified by lawyer Ye and should be rejected the plaintiff's lawsuit, he said. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhao Zhenhai opened the court to conduct a collective hearing. The plaintiff Qiao Yutang, along with his sons Jingen and Wenbao, appeared in court. The defendant Qiao Cao also arrived as summoned. After the judge questioned both parties, he ordered both parties to go out and reconcile. If reconciliation fails, he will schedule another hearing to collect evidence.</p>
<p>Yang Family Property Dispute</p>
<h3 id="e239">Determining Identity and Attempting Reconciliation <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>In the case of Yang Rongfu from Chuansha suing the woman Gong Lu for occupying the inheritance of his adoptive father Yang Shiqiao in the Local Court and requesting a preliminary attachment, the court held a trial. The judge believed that the issue of inheritance could only be resolved after the identity was determined. Therefore, Yang withdrew the case and hired lawyer Liu Mingdu to file a succession lawsuit. The gist of the lawsuit is as follows: The plaintiff Yang Rongfu, 32 years old, from Chuansha, lives at No. 163 Dongjiadu, Yang Yichang Brown Mat Shop, and sues the defendant Gong Lu for occupying the inheritance of his adoptive father Yang Shiqiao (Yang Yichang Brown Mat Shop). He relied on inheritance to request confirmation of the inheritance in order to recover the inheritance. The plaintiff's father, Chun Qiao, and his brother, Shiqiao, had no sons. The plaintiff's father had two sons, the eldest being Ronghua and the second being the plaintiff Rongfu. From an early age, he went to his uncle's house. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, his aunt Zhou died, and the plaintiff wore mourning clothes in accordance with etiquette. All relatives and neighbors knew this. In December of the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, the plaintiff married and established a will as proof. Because his aunt died, his adoptive father lived with Gong Lu and repeatedly wanted to bring in Lu Taosen, the son of her previous husband, but was rejected by his adoptive father. On April 18 of this year, when his adoptive father died, the plaintiff was working in Hankou and rushed back to wear mourning clothes. There were no different opinions. Who knew that Lu was so eager to swallow the property that she secretly moved out the goods in Yang Yichang's shop? In desperation, he filed a lawsuit. The defendant Yang Lu (Gong Lu) also hired lawyer Tang Xingjian to file a defense, stating that in April of the fifth year of the Republic of China, she was married to Yang Shiqiao by matchmaker Gu of the Gu Shunxing Shop as his successor. The wedding was held in the Dongjiadu Catholic Church, and the priest witnessed the wedding. Since passing through the door, she had never seen the plaintiff. Her husband mentioned that he had a son named Asi who died of illness at the age of eight. There was also a nephew named Afu who did not work properly and idled around, so her husband did not allow Afu to enter the door. After her husband died, the plaintiff came to the store under the guise of care.</p>
<p>At first, he visited every day, then he brought his family to occupy the store. Finally, he took the store's business income at will and used it up, and slandered her with various foul words. The plaintiff's lawsuit should be rejected, she said. Yesterday morning, Judge Tong Shengli held a trial. Both parties, accompanied by their lawyers, appeared in court. The plaintiff Yang Rongfu stated the previous situation and said that all the documents had been submitted. The defendant claimed that she was Yang Lu, not Gong Lu. She was 54 years old, from Chongming. She was the successor of Yang Shiqiao. Lu Taosen was her adopted son and had no inheritance relationship with the plaintiff. According to witnesses Yang Ziqing, Hong Dalai, Yang Mao Da, and Huang Xishi, after testifying, the judge ordered the witnesses to mediate outside the court with a time limit of five days. If reconciliation failed, another hearing will be scheduled to collect evidence.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Zhang Huichong Debt Case Withdrawn <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>The case of film actor and underwater magic performer Zhang Huichong being sued by Zhong Caiji, Xie Qingzhang, and Jin Yu, the lawyer representing the Star Film Company, in the Shanghai Local Court to recover a debt of more than 3,800 yuan has been resolved peacefully with the mediation of friends such as Qiu Wanrong. It is now known that after the Local Court attached Zhang's magic equipment, Zhang borrowed 3,800 yuan from friends to deposit in the court as security because he could not go to Xiamen to perform magic. Then he went to Xiamen to perform with more than 20 actresses such as Xu Su'e. However, the plaintiff also deposited 1,300 yuan in the court to provide security when requesting the attachment of the magic equipment. Now that the case has been resolved peacefully, yesterday the lawyers for both parties, Jin Yu and Shen Xingxia, jointly stamped and submitted a request to the court to withdraw the original case and requested that the silver and ocean dollars deposited by both parties be collected after settlement to complete the case.</p>

The case was discovered by Chinese and Western detectives from the Hongkou Patrol Division and the suspects, including Zhou Zicheng, an oil dealer, and Yu Shixian, a Qingkou resident, were arrested. The details of the case have been reported in this newspaper. Zhou Zicheng was found to be unrelated to the case and was released after the patrol division requested his release. The case has been concluded, and yesterday morning Judge Feng Shide declared the sentence in the Third Court: Chen Youyuan was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment, Lin Xinrui was sentenced to four months of imprisonment, Wang Yun was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment, and Wang A'er was sentenced to four months of imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the sentence was determined shall be offset by two days for each day of imprisonment.

<h3 id="e244">Correspondence <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>With respect, I have recently read in the local news section of your esteemed newspaper an article about the lawsuit between Shen Xingtao and Han Qixiang over building a house being resolved out of court. This is not consistent with the facts. Upon investigation, the plaintiff originally filed the lawsuit first, and the defendant's address and the house being built are both located within the Public Concession. Therefore, it should be tried by the Special District Court, without the need for this lawyer to request a ruling. I immediately stated that the defendant's lawsuit in the French Municipal Council was filed later and could not proceed at the request of the defendant's lawyer in the French Municipal Council. If this case were to be tried in the French Municipal Council and a judgment were to be executed, the Special District Court would still need to provide assistance. However, according to Chinese national law, the Mixed Court is not recognized as a special court, and when Chinese executive authorities execute judgments of the Mixed Court, they cannot obtain the qualifications of Chinese executive authorities under national law, etc. Fearing that this would be misreported, I am sending this letter to request a correction. With best wishes for your well-being.</p>
<p>Yan Qing, Lawyer</p>
<p>November 6th</p>
<p>To the esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>With great respect, I have recently read in your November 6th newspaper that Li Yuankang, a shareholder of the Japanese Hongfu Company on Qipu Road, colluded with Bingyang, a fellow villager who had already been punished, on October 16th to sell counterfeit cigarettes, passing them off as Delong Company's Qimei cigarettes from North Henan Road. They were arrested by the French police and sent to the Special District Court for punishment, etc. Upon investigation, our company has no shareholder named Li Yuankang. Furthermore, this person had already published a statement on the 31st of last month declaring that Li Yuankang has no relationship with our company. Fearing that the outside world may not understand and that our company's business may be affected, I am sending this letter to you with the hope that you will allow us to make a correction. We would be extremely grateful. I respectfully submit this and wish you well.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Lu Lianqing, Manager of Hongfu Company</p>

<p>Our stage's daytime shows on Saturdays and Sundays have always been praised by all sectors of society. However, last Sunday, we exceptionally performed "Four Books of Water Margin," which had never been performed during the daytime, resulting in a full house, with latecomers barely able to find standing room. We have now received letters from the academic community and inquiries from all sectors of society, some requesting the performance of "Four Books of Water Margin" and others requesting double roles, and it is difficult to refuse the wishes of the public.
