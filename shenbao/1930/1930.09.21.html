<h3>時評</h3>
<h3>英國遠東經濟調查圑</h3>
<p>英國之遠東經濟調查圑現已首途東來矣其東來之故。爲救濟其商業之衰落也。其調查之目的有二。一則中國之市塲。原爲英國所佔有者。因何而爲日本所侵奪。一則中國市塲之近狀如何。如何而能有多少之恢復。是以此調查圑之東來。先至日本。再至中國。其言有曰。日本生産方法。及其大規模組織之奇才。大有可供英人學習之處。又曰英國在中國之贸易。應查出所以不振之原因。並須查明在中國與英競爭者如何能供應中國需要。較諸英人更爲密切之關係。與夫採取供給華需要貨物之方法。其言外之意。概可想見矣。總之英國此次之遠東經濟調查圑。其所負責。爲如何能推銷貨物於中國。及考究日本如何推銷貨物於中國之方法。因以採用之耳。雖中國市塲。與英競爭者。不止一日本。而英人在中國市塲。以前所有之勢力。大半爲日本所侵奪。故特别注意之耳。</p>

<h3>尤亞豪以騙婚竊盗罪</h3>
<p>探張鼐楊雪玖等</p>
<p>楊雪玖爲情犧牲光明磊落</p>
<p>張鼐遠涉扶桑昨未曾到案</p>
<p>切磋學問氣昧相投五洲皂廠技師張鼐原姓余名雪樓因兼祧外家後嗣故又冠張姓民國十二年下季張在北平師範大學肄業時有無錫女生尤亞豪初讀於北平女高師之化學系是年署期卒業於九月間升入北平師範大學繼續研究化學遂與張爲同學因彼此切磋學問深覺氣味相投感情漸厚張乃屢次向尤求婚均被拒却</p>
<p>自美回國在錫結婚嗣尤畢業獲得學士頭銜即行南歸而張旋亦赴美留學從此天各一方重洋遠隔然張仍未忘情於尤迭次由美函尤且有始終不變節之誓言尤猶未予輕諾十六年張自美返國特央冰人向尤之父母說項張更自承永不納妾之條件尤始於父母同情之下而允許之遂於十七年七月二十二日在無錫飯店與張正式結婚</p>
<p>同居徐匯墊付家用未幾來滬稅居於徐家匯志慶坊十九號是時尤任曁南大學中學部及南洋模範小學敎授張則充五洲皂廠技師而寓所一切用度張未供給分毫概請尤暫行墊付致尤所得束修及私蓄耗於家用者逹二千二百三十六元之多</p>
<p>移愛於楊雪玖女士詎張對此賢内助忽起厭棄意而與南市花衣街竹行弄之城東女學校長名畫家楊雪玖女士發生戀愛每月所得之技師薪金悉數供楊揮霍楊明知張早有妻室亦毫不爲意張旣移愛於楊視髮妻無足重輕故當去年一月間尤分娩時竟晝夜不歸偶一歸家亦復無端尋衅或欲置嬰孩於死地或持刀威脅尤氏自裁或故意將尤推跌致傷更擬用黴菌毒殺髮妻並自作絶命書對尤恫嚇種種舉動極光怪陸離之至</p>
<p>尤亞豪回無錫調攝尤氏不得已致函於楊雪玖之母楊氏請其勸告伊女勿得破壞他人之家庭但卒無甚效果本年二月十二日尤氏因愛子患病伴赴廣仁醫院住院治療至三月十一日其子夭殤張雖抱喪明之痛而絶不加存問此際尤氏腹尚有孕其母見愛女悲痛甚深在滬愈增愴怛故將尤亞豪喚回無錫以便調攝</p>
<p>張楊在慕爾堂結婚滬寓惟留僕傭看守不意張於髮妻歸寗之後即將傭僕辭退房屋退租所有尤氏衣飾等物則命其生母余張氏胞姊宮余氏私行搬往閘北共和路南梅園里五十三號姊家藏匿至五月二十四日遂由張鼐楊雪玖雙方家長公然主婚假三馬路慕爾堂爲張楊結婚從此成爲眷屬矣</p>
<p>以騙婚竊盜罪起訴迨尤亞豪病愈回滬乃與交涉因未得圓滿結果始延律師李祖虞撰狀向特區地方法院提起刑事自訴控張鼐楊雪玖及張母余張氏張姊宮余氏楊母楊氏等騙婚竊盜等情請求按律治罪外並附帶私訴請求判令張鼐償還墊付家用洋二千二百三十六元賠償取去衣物洋三千元及原告生活及將來養育等費洋三萬元</p>
<p>楊雪玖被法院拿獲特院據狀業經兩度開庭因主要被告張鼐楊雪玖俱各在逃未能進行審理准原告聲請掣發拘票飭提到案再行訊核在案兹悉張鼐已經逃往日本旣未回國自難拘案揚雪玖前雖與張同時東渡扶桑但近已回滬仍居於城東女校前日午後三時捕房特派探員前往南市會同該管警署加派警探至該女校將楊雪玖女士拿獲提回特區法院暫發女押所覊押</p>
<p>昨晨提出開庭審問此案原定下禮拜二午後開庭續審楊之家人以尚有三數天之隔恐雪玖女士不耐久嘗鐵窓風味亟延江一平律師請求保釋是以昨晨因此交保問題由程尚豐推事特開第五法庭審問原告尤亞豪衣元色綢旗衫偕其母到案候示被告楊雪玖則係西裝其外罩之大衣爲米色胸綴綢製之花一朶立於被告欄中態度安閒形色自若</p>
<p>推事稱先審問事實程推事先訊以姓字年籍住址等楊供稱年廿八歲上海人住城東女校現無職業江律師即請求將案展期因甫受委託一切辯護手續須查案後方克着手也程推事曰今日姑先審問事實</p>
<p>結婚後即同赴日本遂訊楊以張鼐爲如何人彼有無其他名字楊答不知張鼐爲誰我夫名余雪樓繼訊以結婚經過楊答五月廿四日在慕爾堂結婚完全爲本人作主家有母親及三妹一姊因母親不贊成我之自由結婚故從未與母磋商直至婚前之一夜始與母言次日舉行婚禮母未到塲當然非母主婚另請牧師爲證婚人婚後移住東亞旅館三零五號及三零七號房間嗣乃同往日本我之赴日係爲鬻畫近接母電我先回國於十八號到滬我離日時我夫已赴京都我係留字告别我夫現亦無職業</p>
<p>知其離婚始允相嫁程推事又訊以知否張鼐係兼祧子楊答此事知道且我夫曾對我言已與前妻離婚但其前妻爲誰則未向詢問並亦未問其與前妻離婚時有無證據我因知其旣已離婚故始嫁之且我夫係用余姓出面至其登報聲明一節我未見報自不知其是何用意我母從未向我言及丈夫有函致渠之事我俩相識雖已七八年但其家庭狀况則猶不悉當與結婚時我尚任城東校長職今已由我妹主持校務該校爲我父所手創故我之家附於校内介紹我俩相識者爲陳世貞兹已死矣云云</p>
<p>先稱赴杭繼則赴寗程推事轉訊原告張尤亞豪操北音供稱楊女士頃言我已與張離婚實無其事去年十二月三日夜間張忽謂將於次日赴杭詢以何事則不答請與同去復被拒次日我送至火車站見張所購爲南京票嗣得悉楊女士亦在南京與我夫同住交通旅館廿七號房間楊老太亦在南京我所致彼之快信係在徐家匯付郵現在家中物件概被取去此項快信收據自屬難覔請調查該旅館之旅客姓名簿當能證明我所述之事實</p>
<p>楊言對尤亦頗歉仄李律師即將楊雪玖所書之兩信呈案程推事察閱一過擲交楊閱並訊以是否親筆楊承認該信乃伊致友人胡姓請調查無錫方面對於此事之態度者並稱初不知雪樓即張鼐及旣知之並發覺其以前所謂已經離婚者實爲第一次所娶之妻並非今之原告故函託胡姓調查迨經查明之後我對尤女士亦頗歉仄</p>
<p>楊女士願爲情犧牲程推事諭楊曰汝旣知張鼐來與無錫方面離婚則張對汝實有欺騙行爲汝何不以法律起訴耶楊答此時雖知被騙但感情猶未破裂且我旣經爲情犧牲不忍再進行控告故另謀調解之道耳</p>
<p>交保問題大起辯論江律師遂爲被告辯護謂被告非有意抗傳不到迨得電由日馳歸即行到案今日所供俱屬實情彼亦爲張鼐所愚觀其光明磊落之態度可决不致有逃亡之虞應請准予具結出外聽候傳審云云李律師表示反對謂就被告之信函而論可知被告於結婚之時已知張鼐使君有婦原告尚有種種證據下次開庭當要提出更可證明至被告所供甫於十八日由日回滬殊不足信以原告所知被告早已在滬此皆可調查故最低限度着被告須交舖保云云</p>
<p>交普通保隨傳隨到旋由程推事裁决被告楊雪玖交普通保隨傳隨到改期下星期二午後三時續訊即由到庭旁聽之楊方親屬當庭爲具普通保狀業於昨午暫行保釋矣</p>

<p>學生我倘回去告知了父親。他不要生氣麽。</p>
<p>師你只須對他老人家說。這一回做得不好。以後一定用心。</p>
<p>學生這不行。因爲這一篇論說實在全是父親給我代做的。</p>

<h3>柏白克之改造中國談</h3>
<p>— 絜非</p>
<p>國府法律顧問美人林白克君。係總理生前至好。篤信三民主義。近擬返美爲中國宣傳廢除不平等條約。並於發展中國國營事業。多所擘畫。頃在中央總理紀念週。爲話改造中國事。語重心長。盛意殊可感也。（以下記林白克先生言。）</p>
<p>改造中國。須外人之參加。是早爲美國所絶對否認者。然中國經濟之發展。欲求事之克舉。則必有待於美助。歷來美人之來中國者向持兩種態度。惡意之侵略與善意之援助。而傳敎師則屬於前者。愚於此點。嘗痛斥之於政府。至第二種之態度。則爲愚所當一竭棉薄者。百年以次。中國備受列强之侵凌。馴至長此沉淪。莫克自拔於水深火熱之中。雖中國之病。抑亦世界之病也。蓋世界如人體。一官病則全部展轉。從之。中國之積弱。乃足致世界於不安之狀態。則列强之應爲援助中國發展。亦分所當爲之事。考今日之列强。祗美可爲中國經濟方面之助力。愚此次歸國。蓋即努力於此者也。諸君今當學生時期。對於發展中國。人各有責。此時應爲準備。以爲他日効忠之資。所應加注意者。爲忠於國。忠於校。忠於中山先生。與其所手創之三民主義。乃至忠於貴校校長。人人奉忠。則中國富强。可以立待。而不平等條約。亦不難廢除矣。</p>
<p>絜按。林氏以一外人。詔告我人以忠。用爲他日發展中國之具。國人於此。當知其所諷。而知所猛省矣。</p>

<p>世言演劇之有跳加官。謂是春秋時楚相孫叔敖。蓋優孟以叔敖子貧困。乃服相君衣冠。歌以悟王。世因而附會之也。曩嘗聞太倉王芝祥太史云。加官者。假官也後人諧其聲。以諛頌富貴人耳。廖瑩中江行雜錄云。女優有弄假官戲。其綠衣秉簡者。謂之參軍樁。此其證也。是古穿綠衣。今則改穿紅袍。所謂秉簡。今仍其舊。即執象笏上塲是也。參軍樁。或言樁即裝扮之假借字。又段安節樂府雜錄。開元中。優人黄旛綽張野狐。弄參軍。是唐時已稱參軍矣。太史又云。吳梅村先生鴛湖曲。有云雪面參軍舞鸜鵒。即謂跳加官。今加官上塲。所用面具。粉白如雪。故云雪面也。加官乃俗稱。參軍則典雅矣。舞即跳也。晋王導謂謝尚曰。聞君能鸜鵒舞。一座傾想。尚起著衣帻。令座上擊節爲應。旁若無人。梅村先生詩所云舞鸜鵒者。本此。客有問予跳加官之出典者。爲述所聞如是。</p>
<h3>毛劍佩女士遺事</h3>
<p>— 吉誠自鳩寄</p>
<p>毛劍佩女士。忽以服毒香消聞。以一聰敏伶俐奮發有爲之好女子。而一旦輕生。識與不識者。當爲同聲一嘆也。愚識劍佩。在三數年前。當時劍佩閨友歐靜芬佩芬二女士。與黎明暉女士亦殊莫逆。明暉以二歐識劍佩。愚更以明暉之介而識劍佩。時劍佩旣未習京劇。更不涉影界天眞爛漫。活潑潑地。惟有時談及家庭問題。常謂父親與母親不睦。而母親則爲一無抵抗之婦人。我不能不助母親而爲家庭奮鬥。實則毛韻珂君治家極嚴。劍佩所云。或亦一面之辭也。</p>
<p>劍佩初入影界。韻珂絲毫不知。電影公司與劍佩訂約時。渠輒關照。何日何時攝戲。可先以通知書。來至時汽車可候於宅側。我當自出。不必進門催請。蓋懼其父知之也。旋韻珂漸有所聞。某次清晨。在劍佩赴開元公司攝。婚約時。韻珂突出阻之。父女之間。頗有衝突。劍佩乃奉母外出。居安樂宮某號室中。當時愚曾往慰之。室中並有劍佩胞弟燕秋及歐氏二姊妹。時劍佩謂。憑我區區能力。當可奉養母親。若不許我攝電影。我誓不回家。言下氣忿忿然。厥後韻珂得諸友之慰藉。亦漸平其氣。劍佩亦以閨友之勸導。仍奉母歸宅。於是韻珂乃許女攝電影。而影戲公司職員。亦得正大光明出入於毛宅之門矣。</p>
<p>韻珂初無令劍佩習戲意。自此事發生後。以愛女之性習近於戲劇。乃爲之延師敎習。而以劍佩之敏慧過人。自能舉一反三。是後。父女之感情。乃日見返原。出演於大舞臺時。滿堂三日。彩聲連珠。韻珂意猶未足。於是乃北上拜王瑤卿之門。近則登臺漢臯。盛譽不絶。初不料忽爾玉碎。我知老父之心。其悲痛爲何如耶。</p>
<p>劍佩一生聰敏。惟處處高傲。不肯低頭。乃其大病。今聞服藥致死。由於與某君口角之後。則劍佩之死。不死於他。死在一生大病也。</p>
<h3>王瑤卿壽訊</h3>

<h3>南洋游記（五五）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>二十一日乘公共電車游極樂寺。因在市上熱悶。且欲爲龜社會生活之研究。沿途車行椰林中。時見馬來人小板屋生活極整潔。椰林細菜如茵。如此新村。若不受資本壓制。已甚好矣。板屋雖小。亦有留聲機。亦有華人屋。雖質樸而出來男女均整潔。惟此地婦女染馬來風。敷粉者或濃塗如堊墻。如畫畫。殊不雅。失本來面目也。到極樂寺看寳塔下之放龜池。余極注意龜之社會生活。此放龜池大可方四五丈。中有龜約千數。大者可徑三尺。小者如平常之盤而已。色有黄者白者。生活極安靜。下午五時。園丁以菜葉置水中與食。彼望見菜葉。羣翹首來向。如點名然。亦有靜伏於石畔而不來者。蓋隱逸派也。與菜食則競食。不過其競不烈。到誰口則誰之命運。排擠傾軋之力甚微。若如羣犬之刺牙相咬。則罕矣。吾問之久住此間者。龜亦有戰鬬乎。彼云向未見也。我想此物極高尚而安靜。其　會不治而不亂。故伏羲畫八卦法龜文。而一切哲學均出自易經。然則靈龜爲東方文化之祖師也。後世楊雄仿易作太玄。司馬光以三十年之力注之。而子雲于解嘲一文。對客曰。今子以蝘蜓而嘲龜龍。乃自命爲龜矣。漢樂工有李龜年唐文人有陸龜蒙宋理學者有楊龜山。今日本人以龜爲姓名者甚多。若龜澤太郎。次郎等。噫。龜社會爲寡欲不爭。郅治之社會也。</p>
<p>吾又力事觀察大龜小龜是否相欺侮。有時小龜跨大龜而過。大龜亦不問。猶之余在太原。所見牛食草料。而牛背飛來羣鳥。槽中亦來羣鳥。與牛共食。牛並不惡之。又有太原博物館養之母鷄。獨居一木房。房有内外。其糧食存在内房。外來小雀甚多。羣入其内房食之。從鷄翅下出入。鷄亦不問也。牛鷄等所有權觀念之淡泊若此。故不需要立法家規定幾百幾十條矣。人之道德若禽獸。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（二八一）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　翠竹涙斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離</p>
<p>這一塲的審問。證明他的所言盡是誑話。但是未得眞贜實據。一時也無從判决。可是偵查是少不來的了。那班偵探。比了英倫的福爾摩斯還要厲害。不到幾天。已經把他的行踪。都查明白了。但是這位太太。到底不是章乙青的正式夫人。伊也不好擺出大太太的威勢來。只有在伊自已家裏。那是完全伊的主權。伊在烟榻上用盡心機。想到章乙青如此不忠實。實在可恨。恨不得給他大閙一塲。外頭討來的人。非敎伊滾他媽的蛋不可。轉念一想不可造次。現在的章乙青他自已能活動的人了。不比從前不活動的時候。要仰給於伊。自已不是他正式的老婆。閙狠了。使他轉不過身來。反而要吃虧。人家說狗急跳牆。他倒翻轉臉來。說你又不是我的老婆。管我不着。把我一脚踢翻。我未嘗不能給他算這筆賬。但是那事情閙得滿天星斗。也没有什麽有趣。還是想一點别個法子。用硬工不如用軟工。用粗工不如用細工。慢慢兒的收拾他們吧。於是伊便一步一步的用法子來騙他。用甜言蜜語來餂他。到了這一個月裏的十天功夫。他說要上船。依然讓他去。不過使他明顯的知道。家裏已經知道他不是上船的了。而且伊已經知道他的小公館在那裏了。有時言語之中。便故意提到。章乙青要想掩飾。也無從掩飾。有天。伊竟正式和章乙青開談判了。伊道。你外面有一個人。我是早已知道的了。你也無須瞞我。一個男子只要討得起。三妻四妾。原不禁止的。但望你不要得新忘故。那就是好的了。章乙青聽伊這話。說得好像很可憐見的。便也不說什麽。不說什麽。就好像是默認似的。那位太太。更繼續着說道。况且我又不是你的正式老人。我也不好來管你。不過因爲我們從前總算是個患難之交。我也總算曾經帮助過你一臂之力。現在你們做男人的。没有什麽關係。我們做女人的。一生也就完了。名譽也壞了。對於死鬼。也没有面目在黄泉路上見他了。說到那裏。伊就伏在枕頭上。嗚嗚而泣。大凡女人的眼涙。足以溶化男子的心腸。章乙青討了翠筠以後。本預備那個非正式的老人。倘然和他閙得厲害。便和伊决裂也不要緊。不想伊這番絶不用一些硬工。只是用着軟工。</p>

<h3>洋米産地報小三四錢</h3>
<p>江西米又跌二角半</p>
<p>洋米昨日産地報價回小三四錢市上洋行之兜售西貢米者甚多西貢之外如缅甸各埠亦均報小一二月份小校米砥六兩一錢一號西貢即裝貨七兩二三錢均與早市合劃但滬商以新米上市日湧各地均有豐收之訊洋米價雖低廉合劃但恐遭往年之覆轍未敢定辦</p>

<h3>標粉市步開步昻</h3>
<p>粉運開禁浮空抵補</p>
<p>昨日粉市上下午開盤後各月份均又步步趨昻以洋麥報價雖續小四五六七角不等惟時局已轉樂觀粉運又確已開禁北方年收本年雖見豐稔但南粉久已絶跡就事實上言終有較大之急需蓋政局與禁運旣同時解决無論如何人心自必一度熱奮故上下午各盤買氣已見步暢業外之浮空亦隨時抵補甚劇因此近遠各期已根據實銷步轉昻貴而於洋麥之報價又置不顧也結果本月份較前日漲二分七厘半十月份漲二分半十一月漲二分十二月一月份漲分半二月份漲一分七厘半云</p>
<h3>小麥市期秀現萎</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面上下午開盤後各月份忽轉昻挺因時局轉佳預料此後之粉銷决由沉寂而暢遂小麥前途自然亦有希望雖洋麥依然報小但目前終須顧及實銷國外之比率彷彿又有遠不濟急之概市况之逐步回昻亦非無故也結果九十月份較前日漲四分十一月份漲五分十二月份至二月份漲四分現麥市况特高貨市勢已穩惟中次因市上存底甚厚客户見廠胃已活均求爭先脫手故各檔反較小二三分惟後步北運一暢當不致再小也開山東紅白麥瑤灣麥寳應沙市麥共一萬餘包由福新揀高辦去五千七百包云</p>

<h3>Current Commentary</h3>
<h3>British Far East Economic Survey Group</h3>
<p>The British Far East Economic Survey Group has now embarked on its journey eastward. The reason for their coming eastward is to alleviate the decline of their commerce. There are two purposes for their investigation. One is to determine why the Chinese market, originally occupied by Britain, has been encroached upon by Japan. The other is to assess the current state of the Chinese market and how it can be somewhat restored. Therefore, this survey group will first go to Japan and then to China. They stated, "Japan's production methods and its genius for large-scale organization are greatly worthy of British learning." They also stated, "British trade in China should investigate the reasons for its decline and must also determine how competitors in China can meet Chinese needs and maintain a closer relationship than the British. They must also adopt methods for supplying goods needed by China." The unspoken intentions of their words can be easily imagined. In short, the responsibility of this British Far East Economic Survey Group is to determine how to sell goods to China and to study how Japan sells goods to China in order to adopt their methods. Although there is more than just Japan competing with Britain in the Chinese market, the British have had most of their previous influence in the Chinese market encroached upon by Japan, so they are paying special attention to them.</p>

<h3>British Economic Survey Group</h3>
<p>Departs for China</p>
<p>London, 19th (Reuters): The Far East Economic Survey Group set sail today on the British Steamship Company's "Macedonia." Before departure, Sir Thomas (Chairman of the Joint Executive Committee of British Cotton Industry Groups) told a Reuters reporter that he would first go to Japan. He anticipated a very interesting trip, noting that Japan's production methods and large-scale organizational genius had much to offer for the British to learn. He would be pleased if the group could slightly enhance the mutual benefits of the two countries in discussions with the Japanese. He expects to arrive in China around the end of November. Thompson went on to mention Britain's position in Chinese trade, saying that the group should investigate the reasons for the current situation and the reasons why competitors can meet China's needs more closely than the British, and what methods Britain must adopt to supply China with the goods it needs. British Foreign Secretary Henderson telegraphed the chairman of the survey group to wish him a smooth journey and successful work, saying that his visit to Japan is a sign of the continuous friendship between the two countries, and that the deep concern of the British government and people for China's well-being can be guaranteed by his trip.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Committee Discusses</h3>
<p>Minority Issues</p>
<p>Geneva, 19th (Guomin News Agency): The Sixth Committee of the League of Nations Assembly (i.e., the Political Committee) began today to discuss the German proposal requesting the International Administrative Council and the Assembly to set aside some time to study minority issues. The case was introduced by the German representative, Democratic Party member Kirk, who said that minority issues are often the source of international conflict and are extremely important, but the League of Nations has neglected its obligations in this regard. Therefore, he proposed a thorough change in the current approach. Representatives from Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Japan all debated the issue. Finally, French Foreign Minister Briand also attended the meeting and gave a speech, showing the importance of the case. However, Briand defended the League of Nations, stating that the Administrative Council has made every effort to fulfill its obligations regarding this issue, so there is no reason for a deep discussion of this case. The committee then adjourned and will continue the discussion tomorrow. Also, the Economic Committee today discussed the proposal by the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries that the League of Nations should find a way to formulate a binding interpretation of the term "most favored nation" in commercial treaties in order to avoid international disputes due to indefinite interpretations that hinder the development of commerce. The head of the Danish delegation, Mr. Si Shu, made a proposal explaining it, and then there was a fierce debate among all parties. The meeting was then adjourned. It may be difficult to reach an agreement on this case for a while.</p>
<h3>Canadian Tax Increase Bill</h3>

The new taxes must be implemented immediately, but goods in transit are exempt from the tax increase.</p>
<h3>Andree</h3>
<p>Page from Exploration Diary</p>
<p>Tromsø, 19th (Reuters): The remains of the three Arctic explorers, Andree, etc., were handed over to the Swedish authorities in the church today. Swedish sailors carried the coffins through the crowd and to the dock, where they were placed on a Swedish gunboat for transport back to Sweden for burial. Flags were flown at half-mast everywhere to show mourning. Andree's diary has been published, recording dates from July 13, 1897, to October 2, 1897, a total of 142 pages, mostly studies of astronomy, meteorology, and timekeeping. According to the diary, after the balloon reached the Arctic Ocean region, the climate was severely cold, and the balloon could not withstand the pressure, causing the small boat under the balloon to vibrate frequently on the ice, causing the people in the boat to become abnormally exhausted. On July 13, a fire suddenly broke out in the balloon, but it was eventually extinguished. The explorers landed the next day, but the diary did not say why. From July 22, the explorers traveled on the ice, changing their original plan and deciding to go to the land north of Josef Land. However, the thin ice and deep abyss made the journey difficult, and the explorers crossed in a cloth boat. On August 4, they were blocked by floating water and had to change their plans and go to the Seven Islands outside Pitzbergen. However, the polar bear, which Andree called the "mobile butcher shop of the Arctic Ocean," no longer appeared, resulting in a shortage of food. However, Andree remained unremitting, still collecting specimens of scientific value. The three slowly advanced to the north shore of Pitzbergen, sometimes able to use their boat. Their method of obtaining food was quite sophisticated, using animal blood as cakes to replace bread and cooking a seaweed to replace vegetables. The ice floes were too long, and the explorers could not reach the Seven Islands, and the weather was extremely cold, so they decided to overwinter on the ice, building an ice house. Land was first seen on July 19. The explorers hunted seals and bears for food, but on October 2, the ice floe on which the explorers lived split into two, the ice house shattered, and all three had to salvage their belongings. The diary will soon be published in its entirety.</p>
<h3>Situation Among Parties After</h3>
<p>German General Election</p>
<p>From Excitement to Calm</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Reuters): The mood created by the general election has now returned from excitement to calm. Negotiations among the parties are currently taking place informally. The Brünning cabinet remains confident that it can obtain sufficient support to resist the National Socialists. The National Socialists have suddenly fallen silent after issuing a firm denial stating that they never intended to merge with other parties. Bavaria, where party leader Hitler and others live, remains calm. Their slogan is that we must not allow Germany to be controlled by such empty talkers. Berlin, 19th (Reuters): The most important members of the German government claim that if efforts to organize a majority government fail, the current cabinet intends to continue in power. The government believes that its most important task is to solve the country's financial problems, and it is expected that the various plans contained in the government's program will receive the necessary support from all parties. Even if the government is a minority party, the cabinet will resist if the parliament wants to overthrow it. As for the fear of illegally overthrowing the government, it is ridiculous.</p>

Each round trip takes twelve days. The entire route is 13,460 kilometers long and is divided into twenty stations. The company has signed a joint transportation contract with airlines in England and France. Mail from Saigon, Vietnam, is included.</p>
<h3>U.S. Financial Group</h3>
<p>Another Theory About Buying the CER</p>
<p>Results of Japanese Investigation</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Japanese United News Agency): Regarding the theory that a U.S. financial group is buying the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER), the results of the investigation are as follows: 1. The Northeast government accepts U.S. funds to buy the Russian shares. 2. Russia sells the rights to the CER to U.S. capitalists. The first theory has no follow-up. The second theory is proceeding as follows: After the Soviet Union agrees to the U.S. financial group buying shares, the U.S. representative negotiates with the Russian bank representative in Brussels, Belgium. Next, the Russian bank representative and the Soviet representative negotiate in Berlin. A third representative meeting was held in Hamburg, Germany, on August 24 to resolve the terms of buying the Russian shares of the CER. Japan is paying close attention to this matter because it is closely related to the South Manchuria Railway.</p>
<h3>Sino-German Association Holds Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>Dresden, 19th (Guomin News Agency): The Sino-German Association of Dresden and Leipzig held its annual meeting here today for three days.

German Foreign Minister Courtius was also in Geneva and was represented by Counselor Mihansen, who gave a speech saying that Germany knows the importance of China's position and that China also knows how to maintain this importance. Germany should cooperate with China in construction and not stand idly by.</p>

<h3>National News</h3>
<p>Recent Diplomatic Situation Reported by the Foreign Ministry</p>
<p>On the morning of the 19th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dispatched Fan Jing'an to the Central Broadcasting Station to report on the recent diplomatic situation as follows:</p>
<p>1. Sino-British Negotiations: Sino-British negotiations began in the first half of this year. After the signing of the treaty for the return of the Weihaiwei leased territory, the British Minister went north due to some matters, so there was a period of interruption. Currently, the British Minister, Lampson, arrived in Beijing from Peiping on the 8th of this month to continue various negotiations. Since the British Minister's arrival in Beijing, he has been meeting with Foreign Minister Wang daily to discuss everything. Except for the issue of extraterritoriality, which has not yet been discussed in detail, the other cases are progressing quite smoothly. Regarding the return of Weihaiwei, it can be implemented on October 1st. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently preparing everything in order to send personnel to join the specialists sent by the National Government to take over at that time. Regarding the Boxer Indemnity, the British side has decided to return the full amount to China for construction purposes, to be managed by a board of directors appointed by the National Government. As for the recovery of the Amoy British Concession, it has also been agreed with the British Minister to follow the precedent of recovering the Zhenjiang British Concession, to be recovered unconditionally, with the transfer formalities to be completed by means of a note, without the need to sign a new treaty. The note has already been signed and exchanged. Sino-British negotiations on extraterritoriality have been going on for quite some time. When Minister Lampson came to Beijing last time, Foreign Minister Wang gave the British Minister our country's proposed methods for abolishing extraterritoriality for reference. The British Minister has now submitted his answer to our proposal during this trip south. The answer is still under careful review by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Regarding the issue of punishing Simpson, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent several notes to the British Minister requesting severe punishment of Simpson. This time, the British Minister stated that our request has been telegraphed to the British government for instructions, and that it will be handled as soon as a reply is received. The British Minister came south at this time to discuss various pending cases, and the smooth progress of all negotiations is sufficient to indicate the international standing of the National Government. Although the northern rebel army is doing its utmost to carry out reactionary propaganda in the hope of trapping the National Government in international isolation, it is not known that all countries are not deceived by the rebel side. This time, the British Minister has come south, and the new French Minister, Wilden, is also scheduled to arrive in Beijing on October 16th to discuss the recovery of the Shanghai French Concession's Mixed Court and all Sino-French pending cases. Recently, the Belgian Minister and the Turkish Chargé d'Affaires will also come to Beijing to discuss everything. From this, we can see the attitude of all countries towards the National Government. 2. Sino-Japanese Negotiations: The most recent Sino-Japanese negotiations are the Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiations that are currently underway. The attendees include Japanese representatives and representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Communications. This telecommunications negotiation is an important step for China to recover international telecommunications rights. The so-called international telecommunications generally refer to submarine cables or submarine telecommunications. Many countries have set up submarine cables in our country, such as the Great Eastern Telegraph Company of Britain, the Great Northern Telegraph Company of Denmark, the Pacific Commercial Telegraph Company of the United States, and the telegraph companies set up by France and Japan. Most of their establishment dates back to the late Qing Dynasty, when they took advantage of the Qing court's昏庸不振 and the remaining prestige of various countries' victories in China to compete for aggression against our country's land, economy, and transportation, using every means of aggression. The establishment of submarine cables is one type of transportation aggression, which poses a great danger to national sovereignty. This year, the National Government has canceled the landing rights of submarine cables in China for countries such as Britain, Denmark, and the United States. The purpose of the negotiations with Japan this time is also to cancel this special right enjoyed by Japan in China. According to the Japanese, there are a total of four submarine cables set up in our country's territory: one is the Shanghai-Nagasaki line, the second is the Fuzhou-Taiwan line, namely the Chuanshi Mountain-Tamsui line, the third is the Dalian-Sasebo line, and the fourth is the Lushun-Yantai-Weihaiwei line. In addition, there are land lines along the South Manchurian Railway. Among these five lines, the Shanghai-Nagasaki line and the South Manchurian land lines are the most important, and the loss to our national sovereignty is the greatest. Except for the Shanghai-Nagasaki line and the Fuzhou-Taiwan line, whose contracts have expired and should be recovered, our country has decided to propose the abolition or modification of the remaining three lines based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit between countries in order to maintain national sovereignty. As for the negotiations on the recovery of postal rights in South Manchuria, they are also in progress. The Japanese have set up post offices in South Manchuria, from Dalian in the south to Changchun in the east. All cities along the South Manchurian Railway have Japanese post offices. The existence of Japanese post offices is a great loss to our country's postal rights, and Japan's establishment of post offices in South Manchuria is largely inconsistent with international practice. Since the Washington Conference, China has canceled all post offices set up by various countries in China, and it is naturally inconvenient to treat Japan differently. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already sent a note to the Japanese government on the 4th of this month requesting the prompt commencement of negotiations on the recovery of postal rights in South Manchuria. Once the Japanese reply is received, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Communications will jointly be responsible for handling these negotiations.</p>
<p>3. Sino-Russian Negotiations: Although there has been no significant progress in the recent Sino-Russian negotiations, opinions are still being exchanged continuously. Rumors that the Sino-Russian conference has been suspended and that Representative Mo will return home are unreliable. Representative Mo is still meeting with Karakhan in Moscow from time to time to exchange various opinions, and it is expected that formal meetings will not be far off.</p>
<p>4. Protection of Overseas Chinese: Regarding the protection of overseas Chinese, several points can be made: 1. Recently, a coup occurred in Peru, South America, and overseas Chinese in Peru suffered quite a few losses. Many shops were looted by the mutinous soldiers. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued instructions to Wei Zijing, stationed in Peru, on the 11th of this month to quickly ascertain the extent of the losses suffered by overseas Chinese and report them, and to lodge a serious protest with the new Peruvian government. 2. The Dutch government in the South Seas often takes advantage of the name of protection to encroach upon the estates of overseas Chinese who have no legal heirs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that if this method is allowed to continue, it will be insufficient to fully protect overseas Chinese, so it has instructed the Consul General in Java to lodge a serious protest with the Dutch government. 3. The South African Federation has long been brewing to exclude Asians from doing business in Fiji. This year, the Fijian Congress even passed a resolution forcing Asian merchants doing business in South Fiji after 1929 to close. Later, due to incomplete procedures, it was postponed to January next year for further discussion. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly lodged protests with the South African government and the British government separately. Now, according to a report from the Consulate General in South Fiji, the British in South Fiji have recently formed a so-called Northeast District United Association, which is carrying out a movement to exclude Asians, and has petitioned the municipal authorities to stop issuing business licenses to Asians. Although our overseas Chinese businessmen have filed lawsuits, they have been defeated. Currently, in addition to our Consul General in Fiji lodging a serious protest with the South African government, we are also taking advantage of the opportunity of the Fijian Foreign Minister's presence in the UK to have our Minister to the UK lodge protests with the British government and the South African Foreign Minister separately. 4. Regarding the South Seas Dutch increase in import duties, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed Dai Mingfu, Chargé d'Affaires stationed in the Netherlands, and Zhang, Consul General stationed in Java, to actively negotiate with the governments in their respective locations. According to a telegram from the Chargé d'Affaires stationed in the Netherlands, although the Dutch side has this proposal to increase import duties, it has not yet been fully decided. Currently, in addition to directly sending a note to the Dutch Minister in China to protest, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also telegraphed Chargé d'Affaires Dai and Consul General Zhang to do their utmost to negotiate in order to have the original proposal overturned.</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Orders Grain Storage in Various Places</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan, in order to store grain, specially instructed the Ministry of Interior and the governments of various provinces, saying: "According to a letter from the Central Political Conference, the 242nd meeting of this conference approved the proposal of Committee Member Guo Fu, who stated that this year's harvest in various places seems to have a surplus of grain. However, based on last year's depleted reserves, there may still be a shortage of grain next year. Currently, during the harvest season, farmers often have to sell grain cheaply due to other consumption or the need to repay debts. Therefore, the recent drop in grain prices is not beneficial to farmers and provides an opportunity for unscrupulous merchants to hoard and speculate. In order to maintain people's food supply, it is appropriate to take advantage of this year's bumper harvest to plan for storage and famine relief. Grain storage warehouses in various places should be set up immediately, and those that already exist should be expanded. The amount of grain to be stored in each county should be promptly determined by the provincial governments according to local conditions. If counties lack funds, they may be allowed to borrow from the financial sector at interest, using the stored grain as collateral. A committee of local impartial people should be organized to be responsible for supervision. In areas where farmers' banks have been established, the farmers' banks should provide farmers with mortgage loans for rice and wheat. In areas where farmers' banks have not been established, various pawnshops should provide mortgage loans for rice and wheat within the interest rate range set by the central government. At the same time, hoarding by merchants should be prohibited, and the export of rice and grain should be strictly prohibited. In this way, farmers will have the opportunity to turn around their finances and will not suffer unnecessary losses in the short term. The grain situation in various places can also be kept in balance. Is this feasible? Please make a public decision." After discussion, it was referred to the Executive Yuan for appropriate recording and transmittal, and it is hoped that it will be checked and handled accordingly. This was received. It was previously reported that the Ministry of Interior had submitted the draft of the Various Local Warehouse Management Regulations, which had been approved by this Yuan and submitted to the National Government for instructions for record. The Ministry was instructed to approve the record for the Ministry to announce. Now, the aforementioned case has been submitted, and it should be handled accordingly. In addition to notifying the governments of the various provinces to comply and ordering the Ministry of Interior to supervise the implementation and report to the National Government for review and also communicate to the Secretariat of the Central Political Conference for reference and transmittal, we are also ordering you to comply and report for our review.</p>
<h3>The Min Army Punishing Lu is Advancing Rapidly</h3>
<p>Mobilization Order Issued on the 15th</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Chen Rongbiao, Brigade Commander of Lu Xingbang's department, recently had an internal conflict with Qian Yuguang, Regiment Commander, in Gutian. Qian then lured and killed Chen. It is now found that although Qian's killing of Chen was due to long-standing grudges, he also received a secret order from Lu Xingrong beforehand. Unexpectedly, after Chen was killed, the troops of Chen's department stationed in Gutian and Dahu gathered at Shuikou, cutting off the traffic between Yanping, Youxi, Dahu, and Gutian, claiming that they would not retreat unless Qian Yuguang was punished. Because Lu's troops' connection with Minbei and Fuzhou was cut off, in order to perfunctorily appease the scattered soldiers and maintain the overall situation, he had no choice but to order Qian to be dismissed and await investigation, and ordered Chen's scattered troops to be incorporated into Lu Xingrong's command. Qian Yuguang, feeling indignant that he was acting on a secret order when he killed Chen, and now he is being blamed, sent representatives to the province to express his sincerity and willingness to lead the troops forward. The authorities, observing his sincerity, approved his request and gave him the title of Commander of the Provisional Provincial Defense Army First Brigade. Qian immediately sent a telegram to defect. At the same time, the provincial side received a telegram from Fang Shengtong, reporting that Dehua had been captured on the 13th and he is currently leading various armies to advance towards Datian, directly approaching Youxi. He requested that the provincial side also quickly send troops to attack Yanping in order to receive a pincer attack. Yang Shuzhuang also hoped to resolve the war as soon as possible and specially summoned Liu Heding and Chen Jiliang on the 14th to discuss and decided to appoint Liu Heding as the Commander of the Eastern Route of the Minbei Bandit Suppression, leading the Liu Shangzhi and Chen Wantai brigades to attack the front of Yanping. The Gui Zhenyuan brigade will remain in Fuzhou. Fang Shengtong will be the Commander of the Western Route of the Minbei Bandit Suppression, leading the Chen Guohui, Xiao Shuxuan, Wang Zuqing, and Long Linqing divisions to attack the front of Youxi, and Lin Shuguo, Commander of the 2nd Marine Brigade, will lead the Lin Bingzhou regiment and the 2nd Provincial Police Brigade led by Liu Zongyi to advance from Pingnan and coordinate the attack on the flank of Yanping. Qian Yuguang, together with the Chen Huisheng and Huang Qilan guerrilla divisions, will advance from Gutian and coordinate the attack on the flank of Youxi. The mobilization order was issued on the 15th. Currently, the Lin Bingzhou regiment has departed from Fuzhou to Funing, and Lin Shuguo has also gone from Xinghua to Funing to command. The Liu and Chen divisions set off from the northwest gates on the 15th one after another. The general attack can probably begin in three to five days. However, the troops of the Lu division stationed below Shuikou were greatly affected by Qian Yuguang's defection and hastily withdrew the troops stationed at Gan, Zhe, Zhuqi, Dahu, and Guanyuan to Shuikou. At the same time, Datian was regarded as the gateway to Youxi. If Datian is lost, it will be difficult for Youxi to hold out for long. Two regiments of Youxi troops were urgently deployed to Datian to prepare to resist. Therefore, in the third phase of the war, the eastern route will center on Shuikou, and the western route will center on Datian. If these two places can be captured, Yanping and Youxi can be obtained with ease. (September 17)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Sends Troops to North River to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>Bandits in the Xiaobei River Harass Lianyang and its Vicinity</p>
<p>Zhang Zhen, Representative, Discusses Tranquility on the Guangdong-Fujian Border</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Banditry has been rampant in the North River area of Guangdong Province recently. The most serious is in the Shaoguan and Yingde areas, where bandits in groups of hundreds loot and harass various villages. Huang, a local bandit leader in the Xiaobei River, openly raised the banner of a brigade commander and appointed Deng and Cai as regiment commanders to lead troops to harass various counties in the Xiaobei River. Local merchants have repeatedly telegraphed the province to appeal for help. In addition, according to returning guests from Nanxiong, the border between Guangdong and Jiangxi has been uneasy recently. A week ago, Nan'an, which is adjacent to Nanxiong, was attacked by hundreds of communist bandits. Residents evacuated to Nanxiong. This group of communist bandits was from Peng Cilong's department. After arriving in Nan'an, they extorted money from merchants and then fled south. Therefore, Nanxiong also raised its guard. The county police team and militia were sent to the border to guard against the communist bandits. Finding no opportunity, they turned and fled to Xinfeng. The authorities attached great importance to the report and have been increasing troops northward in recent days to suppress them as the opportunity arises. The method to be adopted is to first eliminate the bandits in the Xiaobei River to secure the border. In addition to immediately deploying the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Independent Regiment stationed in Yingde to join the security team of the Public Security Bureau to search and suppress the Lianjiangkou area, fearing that the force would be too weak, the 1st Battalion of Wu Jianxiong's regiment and Li Yirong's division were also dispatched, along with a platoon of machine guns, on the morning of the 11th to Yingde on the Yuehan train to the Xiaobei River. It is also reported that Deng Hui's entire regiment of the 3rd Independent Regiment has recently been ordered to open north. The 1st and 3rd Battalions of Deng's division have been concentrated in the Beijiao parade ground and will take the Yuehan train to Maba, Wushi, etc. in one or two days to await orders. At the same time, the Eighth Route Army of Guangxi Province, in order to take into account the protection of the Fu River and the defense of northern Guangdong, has drawn part of the 59th Division to respond as the opportunity arises, and has also transferred Zhang Ruigui's division of the 1st Independent Brigade to join Deng Hui's division of the 3rd Independent Regiment to northern Guangdong to consolidate the security of Shao and Ying. As for the border defense of the East River, there have been rumors that the remnants of Lu Xingbang's department may flee to the Guangdong border. According to Kang Zichang, representative of Zhang Zhen stationed in Guangdong, the Guangdong-Fujian border is currently quite peaceful. The rumors of Lu's department harassing are just bandits posing as Lu's department. Xiang Hanping's division is conducting successive suppressions on the East River of Guangdong, and Fang Shengtong is coordinating with Liu Heding's division to go to northern Fujian to trấn慑 the Guangdong-Fujian border bandits. It will not be difficult to eliminate them in the near future. (September 13)</p>
<h3>Cantonese People Oppose the Sha Mian Pass Permit</h3>
<p>Embroidery Guild Asks the Municipal Government to Negotiate</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the great strike of Chinese people against foreigners in Sha Mian Concession in Guangzhou a few years ago, the discrimination against Chinese people has been less than in the past. Chinese people entering and leaving the concession are also said to be free. Unexpectedly, the French Concession in Sha Mian has recently established harsh regulations restricting the entry and exit of Chinese people. Chinese people carrying goods or livestock through the French Concession must pay a toll of one yuan. The most affected are the Chinese merchants who trade with foreign countries, because frequent entry and exit makes it difficult to pay the toll. This measure not only deals a great blow to merchants, but also damages our national prestige. The Embroidery Guild, which has always traded with foreign countries, specially reported the harsh regulations of the French Concession to the Guangzhou Municipal Government and requested that a protest be lodged. The original report roughly stated: "Our guild's business of embroidered scarves has always traded with foreign merchants. All goods must be delivered to Sha Mian. Since August 1 of this year, the French Concession Engineering Bureau has suddenly set up harsh regulations. Chinese people carrying goods and livestock, regardless of where they are carried to and the route they take, must pay a fee of one yuan and obtain a pass before being allowed to pass. The pass must be renewed every month, otherwise, regardless of the size of the item, it will be detained. It is now found that the bureau has issued more than 300 of these passes. Dozens of our guild's shops have had their goods detained because they did not know about this harsh regulation. Thinking that it is normal for merchants to trade goods back and forth, unless they pass through customs and places that must be inspected, there should be no delays or hindrances. Now the bureau prohibits the carrying of goods and even extends to livestock, which is truly rare and unreasonable. This behavior is nothing more than for the purpose of collecting fees, which can be concluded. Even if merchants pay the fee and obtain a pass, there are those who forget to bring the pass when delivering goods, or several partners deliver goods at different times. One pass is not enough to be distributed to several partners. There are various obstacles. However, this is only the difficulty in procedures. If we talk about national prestige, this pass is specially set up for Chinese people carrying goods and livestock, but not for foreigners. All goods entering the warehouses of foreign firms are not questioned before they are sold to Chinese merchants or after they have left Chinese merchants. What could be more unfair than this? Although Sha Mian is a joint British-French concession, it still belongs to Chinese territory. It is acting willfully and recklessly. If we do not argue based on reason, we are deeply concerned that the French Concession will set a precedent, and the British Concession will follow suit. Various special harsh regulations will follow one after another in all leased territories in the country. Thinking about the future, we secretly harbor hidden worries. If we demand improvement for the foreign abuse of Chinese workers, which is an obstacle to international equality, and now the French Concession in Sha Mian has newly established this harsh regulation, if we are willing to accept oppression, then national prestige is at stake, and business is hindered. Merchants have no choice but to endure momentary pain and make great sacrifices, refusing to obtain passes and unanimously suspending business as a passive resistance. However, if this continues for a long time, there is no end in sight, and the losses will be unbearable. Therefore, we clearly state our situation and humbly ask you to quickly lodge a protest and engage in serious negotiations with the French Consul, demanding equal treatment and canceling this pass in order to preserve national prestige and maintain commerce." After receiving the report, the Third Section of the Municipal Government filed a written protest. According to news from the French Consulate, they plan to change the method and exempt the pass fee, but the pass must still be issued. The Chinese side believes that the pass is one of the harsh regulations. If it is not fundamentally abolished, it is closely related to national prestige and will continue to fight to the end.

<h3>Russian Bandits Attack Stations on the Harbin-Manzhouli Railway Again</h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Russian bandits on the Harbin-Manzhouli Railway are elusive and unpredictable. Those who reside in Shudu Yalu adopt a cautious attitude and have not taken much action in the past month. However, the Black Army is responsible for eliminating bandits, and the 15th Brigade led by Su Bingwen is fully responsible for suppressing them in that area. The 51st Regiment of the brigade has been maneuvering around Yalu County, taking a large encirclement posture, but has not yet clashed with the bandits. The Zhu Guofu gang took the opportunity to disturb the area along the line due to the emptiness of the line. Small groups of Russian bandits often appear between small stations, killing and looting merchants and travelers, and leaving as soon as the soldiers arrive. Therefore, corpses are scattered along the western road. In order to protect the safety of the railway line, the Black authorities ordered the 2nd Cavalry Brigade led by Cheng Zhiyuan to set out on the 11th to suppress the area along the road to clear the source of bandits. The direction of Cheng's brigade's departure is above Hailar on the Harbin-Manzhouli Railway. The Russian bandits then turned to disturb the area below Boketu. Yesterday, the headquarters of the road protection army here received a report that bandit traces had appeared near Andada Station, 300 li away from Harbin. Therefore, the authorities felt that it was difficult to suppress these cunning Russian bandits. On the evening of the 12th, the Balimu Station on the western line was almost taken by the bandits. Because the military and police force at the station was quite small, it had been besieged by bandits once a month ago, but the bandits did not succeed. On that evening, two Russian bandits first entered the station disguised as shoppers to scout the news. They were captured by the military and police. After questioning, they learned that a large group of Russian bandits wanted to invade the station and rob the 4th passenger train from Manzhouli to Harbin. Based on this, the garrison immediately notified all stations to pay attention and asked for help from the Boketu, Zhalantun, and Xing'anling stations. Before the reinforcements arrived, the bandits learned that their accomplices had been captured and sent people to demand their release within half an hour. The military and police, fearing that they were outnumbered, retreated towards Boketu and were attacked by bandits outside the station. They fought fiercely for a long time, and more than a dozen soldiers died. Then, 400 reinforcements from the Kang regiment in Boketu arrived and used armored vehicles to repel the bandits. Later, the 8th Cavalry Regiment of Zhalantun also sent 100 cavalrymen to search outside the station, but did not find the bandits. The 4th train, upon hearing the report on the evening of the 12th, stopped at Yalu Station. Passengers were panicked and waited until dawn before departing from Ya Station, delayed by half a day. It was not until 5:30 pm on the 13th that it arrived in Harbin. It was heard that the group of Russian bandits had not gone far, so the armored vehicle of the road protection army had not left the area to trấn懾 the bandits. (13th)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Quick News</h3>

<h3>Local Correspondence</h3>

<p>Fellow Villagers in the Province Request Elimination of Banditry: Jin Xuanqing and other fellow villagers from Song, Jin, and Qing in the province, due to the rampant banditry in their hometown, sent a telegram to the provincial government to list the ways to pacify the bandits in order to clear the people's harm. They requested that the police teams of various counties contact the stationed troops within a time limit to eliminate the bandits and remove the harm to the people, just like Zhao Shuqiao, the governor of the Qing Dynasty, supervised the Wu area and carried out large-scale searches. It is now known that Director Hu has ordered the county magistrates of the three counties to comply and prepare plans to eliminate the harm.</p>
<p>The First District Chief is Ordered to Remain: Zhong Taishi and 10 other district chiefs in this county were previously ordered to go to the province for supplementary studies. Then, various local groups and the people appealed for their retention by telegram. They then received an order from the director ordering Zhong Taishi and others to go to the province to be questioned in person. Now the county government has received an order from the director that Zhong Taishi, the district chief of the first district, and Chen Zhankui, the district chief of the eleventh district, have both been questioned in the province. The results of the questioning of Zhong Taishi, the district chief of the first district, were good, and he was allowed to return to his district to serve.

<p>Competition in the Silk Industry: Suzhou is one of the silk producing areas in our country. Over the years, it has been occupied by imported goods, resulting in a great blow to business. The owners of silk businesses are deeply worried about this. Recently, there has been an advocacy for the use of domestic goods in various places, and people have changed their past habits. Therefore, the business of various silk shops has increased sharply and the doors are bustling with activity. Therefore, the same industry is also competing with each other, such as Guanqian Tongrenhe, Laorenhe, and Qiantai Xiang, etc., which are the most competitive.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Collision of Two Ships Leads to Conflict: The Xing Shun, a small ferry belonging to the local China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau, set out from Qianzhou by tugboat at approximately 11:00 AM yesterday. Around noon, upon reaching the vicinity of Gao Bridge, it encountered a fully loaded open boat carrying Shaoxing wine coming downstream. Unable to avoid it, the ferry was struck violently by the wine boat. Liu Xingsheng, the captain of the ferry, seeing the damage to his vessel, began arguing vehemently with those aboard the wine boat. As a result, Liu Xingsheng was beaten and injured by the wine boat crew. Eventually, Dou Luyi, a local resident, intervened to mediate the dispute. He arranged for the owner of the wine boat to pay thirty yuan as compensation for the repair of the damaged ferry and Liu Xingsheng's medical expenses. Only then was the dispute resolved.</p>
<p>Theft Occurs in Xucheng Township: The Zheng Qin family, residents of Xucheng Township in Fuan, are reasonably well-off, but have no adult men in the household, only eight women. Their home comprises six courtyards. Last night, after midnight, after the family had gone to sleep, over ten bandits, speaking with Changzhou accents and armed with rapid-firing guns, electric torches, and knives, scaled the walls to enter the property, while others kept watch outside. After entering, they first tied up Zheng Qin and locked all the women in one room. Then, they ransacked boxes and chests, stealing whatever they could find. This went on for an hour before they departed with shouts. After they were gone, the family assessed their losses, finding that they had stolen over two hundred yuan in cash, over sixty articles of clothing, and gold and silver jewelry, amounting to a total loss of over eight hundred yuan. A detailed list of stolen items has been filed with the county government, requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>Injured Soldiers Prohibited from Extorting Additional Compensation: Reply to the Wuxi County Government and County Chamber of Commerce: Recently, individuals claiming to be representatives of injured soldiers have been frequently demanding compensation and causing disturbances at fish ponds in the western countryside. The county government telegraphed the provincial government's Department of Civil Affairs and the General Headquarters' Injured Soldiers Management Committee for instructions on whether local areas should provide additional compensation to injured soldiers stationed there. Yesterday, the Injured Soldiers Management Committee replied by telegram, stating that hospitals and injured soldiers throughout the region are prohibited from extorting fees from local areas, as had been promulgated by the General Headquarters. Regarding the issues raised in the inquiry, it stated that any injured soldiers causing disturbances should be dealt with severely according to the law, without leniency. The county government immediately forwarded the telegram to all relevant agencies for their information.</p>

He dispatched the Xiaoxinqiao Defense Corps to investigate and apprehend him. On the 19th, the corps secretly went to Guotang Bridge, where they successfully captured Shen Borong and brought him to the district public office. After questioning by District Chief Cheng, the suspect tacitly admitted to his crimes. The handwriting of the threatening letters received by the victims of the fraud matched Shen Borong's handwriting, leaving him no room to deny his involvement. On the 20th, District Chief Cheng prepared a document and sent the corps members to escort Shen Borong to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Chenjiagou Banditry: On the evening of the 18th, the Yang Guoqing cargo boat, sailing from Xinghua to Shaobo, departed Shaobo early on the 19th and headed towards Yangzhou, passing Chenjiagou near Xiaokouzi. Suddenly, they encountered a bandit boat, which fired a shot and ordered them to stop. Five bandits, armed with handguns, then boarded the cargo boat and tied up Yang, the crew, and over a dozen passengers. They stole one thousand yuan in silver notes from Xinghua Juchengfeng, Yangzhou Huichangyong, and other remittances, fifteen hundred yuan in passenger travel funds, five taels and one mace of pure gold, and other clothing and ornaments, totaling over four thousand yuan in value. Around 2:00 PM, the boat continued to Yangzhou, where the victim reported the incident to the authorities.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Ransom Demands for Eight Abductees from Luhe Town: Regarding the abduction of eight people from Luhe Town, located at the border between this county and Taicang, it has been learned that the bandits cut off all traffic after arriving at the town. They first went to Cao Tiancheng's rice shop, abducting shop assistants Zou Bang'er and Cui Yiheng, as well as Cui Shouzhi, Cui Liangnan, Xu Songfen from Cui’s rice store, Wang, a woman, Zhou Jiaping, Tu Kuiyuan, and Yang Baoqing, shop assistants at Ma Wenrui’s store. They shot and killed Chen Xing, the owner of a tofu shop, on the spot. The bandits blindfolded all those abducted with black cloth, herded them to Baimaokou, and forced them into water up to their chests, soaking their clothes. Then, they took them by boat to Daan Port. Afterwards, relatives of the abducted hired a man named Jia from Hupu, providing him with three hundred yuan for expenses, to negotiate the ransom at the bandits' lair. However, the three hundred yuan was stolen, and the man returned in a wretched state. Recently, Yang Baoqing returned safely to the town, claiming that the bandits had ordered him to return home to deliver a message and announce the ransom amounts: fifty thousand yuan for Zou Bang'er, one hundred thousand yuan for the four members of the Cui family, and thirty thousand yuan for the three shop assistants from Ma Wenrui's store (including Yang himself). The exorbitant ransoms have caused widespread discussion. However, the bandits' lair at Daan Port has been dispersed by the army, and their current location is unknown. It is reported that the families of the abducted have gathered to discuss and send someone to the area again to search for the bandits' trail and negotiate.</p>
<p>Investigation Report on the Oil Well in Fenghuang District: Regarding the discovery of oil in the well at the home of Ya Yinglan in Tianzhuang Town, Fenghuang District, the county magistrate and District Chief Xu Jingyu have investigated and submitted a report. According to the report submitted by assistant Zhao Mengling and Qian Shuyu, who were dispatched by the district, they, along with Yang Dingyuan, the head of Tianzhuang Town, and Yachong, Ya Yinglan's son, were led to a small courtyard where they found an old well. They measured the depth to be just over one zhang, with the water level six chi and five cun from the bottom. When the water was drawn up, the surface was covered with oil slicks. They smelled it and confirmed it had the odor of petroleum. When they tried to ignite it, it would not burn or emit light. According to Ya Yinglan, the well suddenly changed on August 4th. For the first two weeks, the oil slicks were very thick and would ignite immediately when touched with a burning paper. After several heavy rains, the quality of the oil became slightly lighter. Recently, every day at 11:00 AM and 5:00 PM, there were surges of tide that mixed with the oil foam. The oil drawn up at these times was thicker and contained less water. The oil used to light the lamp was said to be the oil foam skimmed off the surface during the surges. Zhao Mengling and Qian Shuyu extracted well water and put it into two bottles to present for inspection. It is learned that District Chief Xu submitted the investigation report by Zhao Mengling and the two bottles of viscous water to the county government.</p>
<p>— Nantong</p>
<p>Measures to Quell Disturbances at the Border Between Tongzhou and Haimen: Major bandit gangs and salt smugglers are entrenched in the Daan, Niuhong, and other ports located at the border between Nantong and Haimen counties, causing disturbances. The provincial government has dispatched the Boxian and Junhe warships to join the provincial naval and land police to suppress them, and has ordered the governments of the two counties to promptly implement the following four measures: 1. Because the outer areas have sandbanks that prevent warships from entering and soldiers from wading ashore, a watchtower must be built between Daan and Niuhong ports, and cannons must be installed for defense. 2. Daan Port is the first district of Haimen, and Laohong Port is the tenth district of Nantong. Because of boundary issues, defenses have been neglected in the area where the two counties border each other. In the future, the two counties should complete the organization of the defense corps in these two districts within a time limit and jointly be responsible for defense. 3. First, eliminate the salt smugglers, and then assign the local defense corps and land and water police to strictly inspect travelers and strengthen defenses. 4. Local residents who know about bandit activities and fail to report them will be treated as accomplices to the bandits. The government must maintain strict confidentiality for those who report them.</p>
<p>The Dispute Over School Farmland to be Resolved by the Ministry of Education: The dispute between Tongzhou and Haimen counties over the reclamation and grazing of school farmland, which has been ongoing for two years, was recently submitted to the Ministry of Education for resolution. Minister Jiang ordered the Department of Education to instruct the two counties of Nantong and Haimen to have the Tonghai Reclamation and Grazing Company hold the rent from the school farmland in escrow until a decision is made in the case, and that neither party may forcibly collect it or cause trouble.</p>
<p>Ancient Cannon Unearthed at Chongzhong: While constructing the wall foundation at Chongjing Middle School in the northeast camp of the city, three ancient cannons were discovered. They were all made of iron and have been sent to the county for safekeeping.</p>

Xia Fort Defense Corps Disarmed: The Xia Fort Defense Corps of Lugang District was disarmed by County Magistrate Qian on the 16th due to a significant suspicion. This included three handguns, machine guns, and over ten rifles. Corps leader Ji Kai was taken into custody by the county and will be handed over to the judiciary for handling.</p>
<p>Li Jigen Appointed Commander of the Guerrilla Force: Li Mingyang, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Department, has now appointed Li Jigen, a former bandit leader who has surrendered, as the commander of the Security Department's guerrilla force and commander of the bandit suppression vanguard. He is ordered to lead his troops alongside General Commander Li to guide the bandit suppression efforts in various counties.</p>
<h3>Jingjiang</h3>
<p>Recruitment Committee Member Dies from Injuries: Jin Desheng and others, recruitment committee members sent by the Jiangsu Provincial Security Department to Huaiyin, were attacked by bandits with guns while Jin was recruiting soldiers in Chenji, the Second District of the county. He was seriously injured. He was taken to the Puren Charity Hospital for treatment. He died in the hospital yesterday (the 16th) due to the severity of his injuries. Today at 10:00 AM, County Magistrate Shen Cheng Shen, along with Sun Yunshi, a recruitment officer, went to Ren Ci Hospital to investigate. Han, the captain of the First Police Company stationed at Chenji, also arrested the murderer, Wang Shibiao, and sent him to the county government for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Hospital Director Commits Suicide by Jumping into the Sea: Li Ruheng, a doctor and director of the Daishan Epidemic Prevention Hospital, boarded the Donghai ship, which was sailing from Wushantou to Ningbo on the 15th of this month, in the officer's cabin. Unexpectedly, when the ship reached the waters off Gao Ting Damen Sankuai Mountain, Li suddenly jumped into the sea and committed suicide. The ship immediately stopped to rescue him, but after two hours, no trace of him was found, and they had to continue to Ningbo. It is reported that Li disembarked at Dongshajiao without any luggage, carrying only a paper umbrella. The reason for his suicide is unknown, as he left no letter behind.</p>
<p>Fundraising Committee Member of the Defense Corps Abducted: Sun Yaoquan, a fundraising committee member of the Yuyao Northeast District Defense Corps, was passing by the Qingxin Pavilion in Sanxingtang around 6:00 PM on the 14th of this month when he was suddenly accosted by six or seven bandits who drew handguns and wooden holsters, warning him to remain silent. They abducted him and headed east. It is reported that these bandits are followers of the Communist leaders Fei Dezhao and Hu Yunkui. The Yuyao County Government has been notified and has ordered its subordinates to search and rescue him.</p>
<p>The Fast Boat North of Ci Was Robbed: The early-morning fast boat from Guanhaiwei north of Ci County was sailing from Guanhaiwei on the 17th when it reached the Hongqiao area. It was nearly dawn when suddenly seven or eight bandits on the shore, holding wooden holsters, opened fire and ordered the boat to stop. Then, three bandits disguised as passengers on the boat rose up and responded, each drawing a handgun and opening fire on the boatmen. The terrified boatmen docked the boat, and the bandits robbed it. After the robbery, they went ashore and left. The total loss is estimated to be over five hundred gold yuan. Fortunately, no one was injured. Communist Bandits in Wen Prefecture Will Soon Be Eliminated: Wang Wenhan, the bandit suppression commander stationed in this port, had previously rushed to Wen Prefecture with his troops to suppress the bandits there. Reliable information has now been received that, since Commander Wang Wenhan supervised the bandit suppression efforts in Wen Prefecture, many bandits have been killed or captured. The bandits' power has been diminished and will soon be completely eliminated.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Educational Surtax to Be Collected Regularly: The original county education fund in Shaoxing (derived from the collection of an autonomous surtax) was ordered by the province to be returned for autonomous use, with instructions to find other appropriate means of compensation. The Third County Education Conference decided to double the existing collection of school surtax to compensate for this. The Education Bureau submitted this proposal to the county, which in turn submitted it to the province for approval. An order was received to convene local public organizations to discuss appropriate measures. It was decided to pass the original proposal, with a one-year term. The provincial government has now approved this plan. In addition to the original collection of the school surtax, an additional half will be collected, amounting to four jiao per mu of field, two jiao per mu of land, and one jiao per mu of mountain land. County Magistrate Huang has set the date for the implementation of the additional surtax to begin on October 1st.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Decides</h3>
<p>To Increase Water Rates</p>
<p>Effective October 1st</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council held a board meeting the other day regarding the proposed increase in water rates. The council recognized that the increase was unavoidable and unanimously approved it. The decision has been officially passed and submitted to the Consular Body for filing. The company has decided to implement the plan on October 1st of this year. The company has responded to the opposition letters from various public bodies, including the Ratepayers' Association, the Municipal Ratepayers' Association, and the Citizens' Association.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association received a reply from the Municipal Council yesterday, which stated: "To the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association, We acknowledge receipt of your letter of September 6th, forwarding the resolution of your representatives' meeting requesting a delay in the implementation of the water rate increase. Your letter has provided this council with an opportunity to explain the reasons for approving the rate increase. This council firmly believes that, after this explanation, your association will consider this council's measures to be appropriate, and the various misunderstandings in society will be dispelled. Article 10 of the contract signed on March 17, 1928, and published in the Gazette on April 6th of the same year stipulates that the price of water must be based on the net profit sufficient to pay the annual statutory dividend on all classes of stock. If the net profit in a given year is insufficient to cover the statutory dividend, the difference must be made up from the net profit of the following year. The dividend for the following year will be increased by the amount necessary to make up the deficit from the previous year, resulting in an increased rate. Article 13 stipulates that water rates should be revised every five years after July 1, 1929, but the effective period of the rates may be shortened at any time if both parties agree. According to this article, the current water rates were agreed upon to be effective for two years, from July 1, 1929, to June 30, 1931. The agreed exchange rate was two shillings and five and a half pence. The documents regarding the agreed rates were published in the Gazette on April 26, 1926. Due to the current sharp decline in the exchange rate, the water company's expenses are projected to be higher than in previous years. After calculating the income and expenses for the first four months of this year, the net profit for this year is far less than that of last year. In order to fulfill the obligations stipulated in Article 10 of the aforementioned contract, the company proposed an additional surcharge as a way to solve the problem. This council cannot sit idly by and allow the safety of a company responsible for supplying the public with essential goods to be jeopardized. If no remedial measures are taken, the company will be unable to pay the statutory dividend. The rate of this dividend was previously calculated to be sufficient to attract new capital to expand the company's projects to meet the ever-increasing needs of society. If your association believes that this council has overemphasized the interests of the shareholders in the aforementioned reasons, then when this council approved the plan, it considered that both the dividend losses for this year and the depletion of the average dividend reserve fund must be compensated for during the next rate period. If we do not seek remedial measures now, the water prices borne by users in the future will increase sharply. While this council is doing its best to plan remedial measures, it is also taking into account the economic stability of the company. Therefore, it has reached an agreement with the company to extend the current rate period until the end of next year, with a surcharge of two and a half percent. If the exchange rate rises to two shillings, the entire plan will be reconsidered. The two and a half percent surcharge has been estimated to be sufficient to cover this year's dividend. We are writing to inform you of this, and we hope that you will take note of it."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Strict Investigation of Resistance to the Forced Collection of Rent</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government was ordered to raise customs revenue bonds. The fundraising committee decided to collect two months' rent in exchange for bonds, as previously reported. It has been heard that some people are distributing leaflets inciting citizens to oppose this. The Municipal Government believes that the collection of rent has been agreed upon by the gentry and business leaders of this city and has been approved by Chairman Jiang. Moreover, the interest on the bonds is favorable, and the citizens will suffer no losses. The authorities believe that only reactionary elements would take the opportunity to disrupt the process, and they have secretly ordered the Public Security Bureau to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>

<h3>Shipping News from the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Resumes Sailings on the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company originally had four ships sailing to Yichang and Shashi in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. However, due to the political situation in recent years, the sailings were suspended for nearly two years. Now that the Ministry of Transportation will stop military transportation and the requisitioned Yangtze River ships will be gradually returned to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The company, noting that foreign ships such as Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Nissin are competing to add direct Shanghai-Yichang ships and that there is a surge in the transportation of yarn and cloth, has decided that the Kuaili will resume direct Shanghai-Yichang service on the 23rd after arriving in Shanghai today. This is the first ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to resume direct sailings to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in two years. In addition, the Jiangda has also been returned to Shanghai. Due to damage to the ship, it will be put out to bid for major repairs today. The Sanbei Company's Wuxing is also scheduled to come to Shanghai from upstream, after which it will be allowed to operate direct Shanghai-Yichang sailings to compete with British and Japanese ships for business on the upper reaches. The Wuhu will depart tomorrow. Taikoo's new ship, the Wuhu, has undergone major repairs for sixty days, completely remodeling the cabins with a beautiful layout. Its speed is even faster than originally planned, making it the fastest ship on the Yangtze River. It will move to the Taikoo Wharf in Puxi today to load cargo and passengers and is scheduled to clear customs on the evening of the 22nd. It will make stops along the way to Yichang, passing through Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, Hankou, and Shashi, to benefit merchants and passengers.

<h3>National Products Association</h3>
<p>Preparing to Participate in the National Industrial and Commercial Conference</p>
<p>Soliciting Members' Opinions and Compiling Proposals</p>
<p>The China National Products Maintenance Association believes that the Industrial and Commercial Conference convened by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is of great importance to the development of the national products industry. It specifically telegraphed to request permission to send representatives to attend. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce replied by telegram that the person in charge of the association (Standing Committee Member Wang Jiean) had already been hired. The association has now notified all its industrial and commercial members to solicit opinions and compile proposals so that the Wang representative can submit them at the conference. The notification is transcribed below: Respectfully announced, we have recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which reads: "We have received your telegram. The Ministry has determined to convene an industrial and commercial conference to promote industrial and commercial policies, promote the development of production, promote overseas trade, and increase the national economy. We hope that the industrial and commercial sectors can express their opinions as much as possible to increase the effectiveness of the conference. Therefore, regarding the personnel attending the conference, Article 3, Paragraph 3 of the conference regulations stipulates that twenty to thirty people from domestic and overseas industries and businesses who are renowned should be hired. The people in charge of the association have already been hired. The opinions of national product manufacturers can be widely collected and proposals prepared, which will be submitted by the representatives of the association attending the conference for discussion. The Industrial and Commercial Department has stamped its seal for this reason. Having received this order, it was submitted to the 26th meeting of the 19th Executive Committee. In addition to the general plan prepared by the association, this telegram is sent to all manufacturers, asking them to send their heartfelt pain and hopes for improvement to the association within two weeks of receiving this letter. The association will compile the proposals, submit them to the representatives of the association attending the Industrial and Commercial Conference for discussion, and implement them. The Industrial and Commercial Department is waiting for instructions." The industrial and commercial sectors in China have suffered greatly in recent years and have reached a dead end. No one has appealed on their behalf. Fortunately, Minister of Industry and Commerce Kong has keenly seen the difficulties of the people and is deeply seeking to understand the hidden plight of businesses and has convened a national industrial and commercial conference. How can we not admire his great plan? The industrial and commercial colleagues of the national products sector should take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to express all the obstacles they have encountered, without exaggeration or concealment. They should send their opinions to the association on time so that the attending representatives can fulfill their duties. If they can strive for even a small amount of benefit at the conference, it will be an added assurance for the national products sector. Therefore, we send this notice in accordance with the regulations. We hope that your members will consider this to be a matter of life and death for our national products sector and will take advantage of this opportunity to submit their opinions as much as possible so that the government can adopt and implement them to benefit the people and secure the foundation of the country. We are eagerly awaiting your reply.</p>

<h3>Wheat Flour Finally Approved for Customs Clearance and Northern Transportation</h3>
<p>Two to Three Hundred Thousand Bags</p>
<p>The ban on transporting wheat flour from this port to the Tianjin port has been lifted for many days. However, the customs authorities only received a formal order yesterday. Therefore, the northern transportation of wheat flour was also delayed until yesterday before it was approved for customs clearance. Because there is still a lot of foreign flour in the north, Tianjin merchants are not very enthusiastic about ordering goods here. It is estimated that about 300,000 bags of wheat flour were declared yesterday. Furthermore, due to the lack of ships going north, many of those who declared customs clearance were still unable to ship their goods.</p>
<h3>Various Silk Factories</h3>
<p>Suspending Work Early Due to Lack of Raw Materials</p>
<p>Due to the lack of raw silk cocoons and the sluggish market and tight financial turnover, more than 40 silk reeling factories in Zhabei have suspended work early, one after another. It is estimated that more than 16,400 workers have been laid off. Most of the remaining silk factories will also suspend work early and resume operations after the spring cocoons are available next spring.</p>

<h3>Embroidery Industry Association</h3>
<p>Meeting to Help Member Shi Xinchang</p>
<p>The Shanghai Embroidery Industry Association held an executive committee meeting at 8:00 PM the day before yesterday, with more than ten committee members present. Chairman Yang Yongrun first reported the purpose of the meeting, saying that the meeting was being held to request assistance for Shi Xinchang's house being forced to relocate by the landlord Xu Benji. Next, members Shi Xinchang and He Yunzhang stated that their company moved into the premises in the 13th year of the Republic of China. The houses were dilapidated and uninhabitable. When the engineers of the Engineering Bureau passed by, they saw that the interior was decaying and did not allow repairs, so they issued a notice to revoke the construction. At that time, they asked Xu Benji to rebuild, but he did not agree. The company was in a dilemma and had no choice but to invest more than 50,000 yuan to build a Western-style building and pay a tip of 7,000 yuan. Now, after only seven years, they are suddenly forced to relocate, and the company will inevitably go bankrupt. They requested assistance. Next, Zheng Baoyuan explained the assistance methods (omitted). After discussion, it was decided to: 1. Submit a petition to the Party Department to advocate for justice; 2. Send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, hoping that it would consider them as fellow members and resolve the matter; 3. Submit a petition to the Municipal Government's Social Bureau for a fair ruling; 4. Send a letter to the court for a fair judgment; 5. Declare the facts and reasons to various groups for assistance; 6. Send representatives to petition various parties; 7. Organize discussion groups based on the law and other proposals. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Federation</h3>
<p>Asks for Relief for Disaster-Stricken Overseas Chinese in Pontianak</p>
<p>Approved by the Executive Yuan after being submitted by the Ministry of Interior</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation of the Republic of China telegraphed the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, the Executive Yuan of the National Government, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Relief Committee to provide relief to the overseas Chinese in Pontianak, Dutch Borneo, who were affected by the fire. It has been heard that the Ministry of Interior replied in a telegram: "The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation is aware that the overseas Chinese in Pontianak have suffered heavy losses in the fire, which is deeply concerning. It has been submitted to the Executive Yuan's meeting for deliberation and approval to allocate funds for relief." The Qiaoyin Relief Committee of the Ministry of Interior replied in a telegram: "The Overseas Chinese Federation is aware that the Huaqiao residential area in Pontianak, Borneo, Southeast Asia, has suffered a terrible fire and suffered huge losses. It is earnestly requested that you preside over the relief effort to show the central government's concern for the disaster-stricken overseas Chinese. Your association's concern for overseas Chinese is greatly appreciated. However, the funds for relief from our committee have already been allocated and there are no funds left. We will wait for a way to raise funds before reviewing and processing the matter." The Executive Yuan then took a further step to allocate relief funds and also resolved to submit a petition to the National Government to instruct the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to send resident consuls to investigate the disaster and offer condolences to the victims.</p>
<h3>Salary Increase for Seamen Has Been Implemented</h3>
<p>Seamen serving on various ships have not received a salary increase for several years. They have jointly submitted a petition to the Seamen's Shanghai Branch through various ship workers, guilds, dormitories, and clubs, which was forwarded to the Chinese Seamen's Industrial Federation. The federation sent members to consult with the Shipping Association, and a salary increase agreement was signed last month. However, although the agreement has been signed, the shipping companies have not yet fulfilled it. The Seamen's Federation has sent a letter to the Shipping Association inquiring about the matter. The Shipping Association has now replied with two letters, saying that the agreement has been implemented in full. The two letters are copied below: (1) Received a letter stating that the salary increase for seamen will be implemented from August 1st in accordance with the agreement. However, according to the workers of each ship, the companies have not paid the increased salaries. The association is requested to notify the shipping companies to issue the increased salaries to the seamen to prevent problems. After checking with the association, it was found that the agreement had been printed and distributed to all members for compliance. A letter from the Shanghai branch of your federation was received on the same matter, and another letter was sent to all members to comply with the agreement. A reply is hereby sent for your reference. (2) A letter was received stating that your association's letter No. 4492 requests that we urge the shipping companies to increase the salaries of seamen in accordance with the agreement. After checking the case, a letter from your association was previously received on the same matter, and another letter was sent to all members to comply with the agreement.

<h3>Total Statistics of Cholera Cases in the Past Three Weeks</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Temporary Office for the Prevention of Cholera is very serious about checking for cholera bacteria. According to Dr. Wu Liande, the office sends people to five places every day: Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, Hongkou Epidemic Hospital, Red Cross Epidemic Hospital, Emergency Epidemic Hospital, and Public Shanghai Hospital, to check patients. If necessary, they will immediately go to the patient's home to check the population in their home. Once, four people with cholera bacteria were found in the home of a patient at the Hongkou Epidemic Hospital. Because the person had a strong antitoxin, the bacteria did not erupt and cause harm. They were injected with a preventive vaccine to kill the bacteria. It is also heard that the epidemic in Shanghai has weakened this year. From the beginning of summer to August 27th, no genuine cholera had been discovered. Genuine cholera began to be detected on August 28th. The following are the total statistics of cholera patients in the above-mentioned five hospitals in the three weeks from August 28th to September 18th: Shanghai Epidemic Hospital: 31 inpatients, 8 discharged, 5 deaths, and 19 currently hospitalized.

A strict investigation and prohibition should be requested.' Previously, a joint announcement was issued to prohibit feudal-style wedding and funeral ceremonial guards, and your bureau was instructed to strictly prohibit them. Now, the situation is being reported, and a further letter is being sent to your bureau to investigate and instruct all districts to instruct all police officers to pay attention at all times and ensure that the prohibition is enforced in accordance with the law.' The order has been issued to investigate and prohibit this case, and the Social Bureau has jointly drafted provisional rules for prohibiting wedding and funeral ceremonial guards, which have been announced to the public. Why is the previous situation still occurring? The district is not implementing the order effectively, which can be seen.

The Ministry of Interior previously drafted clothing regulations and submitted them to the National Government for promulgation and implementation. The circulation of odd costumes and outfits has been prohibited. Recently, it has been discovered in the city that a small number of women are wearing gorgeous clothes without socks or wearing short socks and exposing their legs, flaunting through the city. This kind of bad habit originated with foreign women who flaunt their beauty as a way of demonstrating uniqueness. The ignorant women of our country are following suit, which is very detrimental to customs. In addition to ordering all districts to strictly prohibit such attire, this joint announcement is issued for the information of all women in the city. Do not intentionally violate the prohibition, or you will be punished." This is an urgent notice.</p>

<h3>Recent Developments at the Second Work-Study Home for Vagrants</h3>
<p>The former Songhu Reformatory on Song Park Road in Zhabei used to rely on donations. Since it was taken over by the Shanghai Charity Association in May of this year and renamed the Second Work-Study Home for Vagrants in Shanghai, regular and temporary expenses have been stipulated, and capable personnel have been selected to manage it. At the same time, the donation collection office was abolished, and fundraising was stopped, as had been announced in the newspaper. It has now been four months. The home previously had skills such as towel making, straw rope making, and paper making. Now, shoemaking, paper box making, and sewing have also been added. The products are of excellent quality and are quite popular in society. Even the apprentices are being reformed and learning skills, showing significant improvement compared to before. Recently, it has been reported that there are still bandits outside falsely using the names of the home and the Songhu Reformatory to forcibly solicit donations from businesses.

<h3>Yu Yahao Accuses of Marriage Fraud and Theft</h3>
<p>Detectives Zhang Nai and Yang Xuejiu</p>
<p>Yang Xuejiu's sacrifice for love is open and honest</p>
<p>Zhang Nai traveled far to Japan but did not appear in court yesterday</p>
<p>Sharing Knowledge and Mutual Interests Zhang Nai, a technician at the Wuzhou Soap Factory, whose original name was Yu Xuelou, took the surname Zhang because he was also the heir to his maternal grandfather's family. In the autumn of 1923, when Zhang was studying at Beijing Normal University, there was a Wuxi girl named Yu Yahao who initially studied in the Chemistry Department of Beijing Women's Higher Normal School. In September of that year, she graduated and entered Beijing Normal University to continue studying chemistry. She became a classmate with Zhang, and because they shared knowledge and felt mutual interests, their relationship gradually deepened. Zhang repeatedly proposed to Yu, but was rejected each time.</p>
<p>Married in Wuxi after returning from the United States After Yu graduated and obtained a bachelor's degree, she returned south. Zhang also went to the United States to study. Since then, they were separated by vast oceans. However, Zhang still did not forget Yu and repeatedly wrote to Yu from the United States, vowing to never change his mind. Yu still did not easily agree. In 1927, Zhang returned to China from the United States and specially asked a matchmaker to speak to Yu's parents. Zhang also promised that he would never take a concubine. Yu finally agreed under the sympathy of her parents. On July 22, 1928, she officially married Zhang at the Wuxi Hotel.</p>
<p>Cohabiting in Xuhui and Advancing Household Expenses Not long after, they came to Shanghai and lived in No. 19 Zhiqingfang, Xujiahui. At that time, Yu was a teacher at the middle school department of Jinan University and Nanyang Model Primary School. Zhang was a technician at the Wuzhou Soap Factory. Zhang did not provide any household expenses and asked Yu to advance them temporarily. Yu's income and private savings spent on household expenses amounted to more than 2,236 yuan.</p>
<p>Transferring Affection to Ms. Yang Xuejiu Unexpectedly, Zhang suddenly became tired of this virtuous helper and fell in love with Ms. Yang Xuejiu, a famous painter and principal of Chengdong Women's School in Zhuhang Lane, Nanshi Huayi Street. All of Zhang's technician salary was spent on Yang. Yang knew that Zhang was already married, but did not care at all. Zhang transferred his love to Yang and regarded his wife as insignificant. Therefore, when Yu gave birth in January of last year, he did not return home day or night. Occasionally, when he returned home, he would find fault for no reason, or want to kill the baby, or threaten Yu to commit suicide with a knife, or deliberately push Yu to injure her, or even try to poison his wife with mold. He also wrote a suicide note to intimidate Yu. All kinds of actions were extremely bizarre.</p>
<p>Yu Yahao returned to Wuxi for recuperation Yu had no choice but to write to Yang Xuejiu's mother, Ms. Yang, asking her to advise her daughter not to destroy other people's families, but it was to no avail. On February 12 of this year, Yu accompanied her sick son to Guangren Hospital for hospitalization. On March 11, her son died young. Zhang did not show any grief or concern. At this time, Yu was still pregnant. Her mother saw that her beloved daughter was deeply saddened and became more miserable in Shanghai. Therefore, she called Yu Yahao back to Wuxi for recuperation.</p>
<p>Zhang and Yang were married at Moore Memorial Church The Shanghai residence was only left with servants to guard it. Unexpectedly, after Zhang's wife returned to Ningbo, he dismissed the servants, returned the house, and ordered his birth mother, Yu Zhang, and his sister, Gong Yu, to secretly move all of Yu's clothes and other items to No. 53 Nanmeiyuanli, Gonghe Road, Zhabei. On May 24, Zhang Nai and Yang Xuejiu's parents publicly presided over the wedding at Moore Memorial Church on Samma Road, and Zhang and Yang became married from then on.</p>
<p>Prosecuted for Marriage Fraud and Theft After Yu Yahao recovered from her illness and returned to Shanghai, she negotiated with Zhang, but it did not have a satisfactory result. She then hired lawyer Li Zuyu to file a criminal self-prosecution with the Special District Local Court, accusing Zhang Nai, Yang Xuejiu, Zhang's mother, Yu Zhang, Zhang's sister, Gong Yu, and Yang's mother, Ms. Yang, of marriage fraud and theft, requesting that they be punished according to the law. In addition, she filed a private lawsuit requesting that Zhang Nai be ordered to repay the household expenses of 2,236 yuan, compensate for the taken clothes of 3,000 yuan, and pay for the plaintiff's living expenses and future upbringing expenses of 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yang Xuejiu was arrested by the court The court has opened a court twice based on the allegations, but because the main defendants Zhang Nai and Yang Xuejiu were all at large, the trial could not proceed. The plaintiff was allowed to request the issuance of arrest warrants to bring them to court for further interrogation. It is now known that Zhang Nai has already fled to Japan and has not returned to China, so it is difficult to arrest him. Although Yang Xuejiu also traveled to Japan with Zhang at the same time, she has recently returned to Shanghai and still lives in Chengdong Women's School. At 3:00 PM the other day, the patrol room specially sent detectives to Nanshi to cooperate with the local police station to send additional detectives to the women's school to arrest Ms. Yang Xuejiu and bring her back to the Special District Court for temporary detention in the women's detention center.</p>
<p>She was brought to court for questioning yesterday morning The case was originally scheduled to be reopened next Tuesday afternoon. Yang's family feared that Ms. Xuejiu would not be able to endure the taste of iron windows for a few more days, so they hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to request bail. Therefore, Judge Cheng Shangfeng specially opened the fifth court yesterday morning to hear the bail issue. The plaintiff, Yu Yahao, arrived in court with her mother, wearing a yuan-colored silk cheongsam. The defendant, Yang Xuejiu, was wearing a western suit with a beige coat with a silk flower on her chest, standing in the defendant's box, calm and composed.</p>
<p>The judge said that he would first interrogate the facts. Advocate Cheng first asked about her name, age, and address. Yang said that she was 28 years old, a native of Shanghai, living in Chengdong Women's School, and currently unemployed. Lawyer Jiang immediately requested that the case be adjourned because he had just been entrusted with the case and all the defense procedures needed to be investigated before he could start. Judge Cheng said that he would first interrogate the facts today.</p>
<p>She went to Japan with her after the wedding Judge Cheng then asked Yang what kind of person Zhang Nai was and whether he had other names. Yang replied that she did not know who Zhang Nai was. Her husband's name was Yu Xuelou. She continued to ask about the wedding process. Yang replied that she was married at Moore Memorial Church on May 24. She was completely in charge of the wedding. She had a mother and three younger sisters and one older sister. Because her mother did not approve of her free marriage, she never discussed it with her mother until the night before the wedding. Her mother did not attend the wedding. Of course, her mother did not preside over the wedding. She hired a pastor to be the wedding officiant. After the wedding, she moved to rooms 305 and 307 of the Dongya Hotel. Then she went to Japan with him. She went to Japan to sell paintings. She recently received a telegram from her mother and returned to Shanghai on the 18th. When she left, her husband had already gone to Kyoto. She left a letter to say goodbye. Her husband is also currently unemployed.</p>
<p>She only agreed to marry him after knowing that he was divorced Judge Cheng also asked if she knew that Zhang Nai was also the heir to his maternal grandfather's family. Yang replied that she knew about this and her husband had told her that he had divorced his ex-wife. But she did not ask who his ex-wife was, nor did she ask if there was any evidence when he divorced his ex-wife. She only married him because she knew that he was already divorced. Her husband used the surname Yu. She did not see the newspaper announcement, so she did not know what his intentions were. Her mother never told her that her husband had sent a letter to her. Although she had known him for seven or eight years, she still did not know about his family situation. Chen Shizhen, who introduced them to each other, was now dead.</p>
<p>First claiming to go to Hangzhou, then to Ningbo Judge Cheng turned to the plaintiff, Zhang Yu Yahao, who spoke with a northern accent and said that Ms. Yang's claim that she had divorced Zhang was not true. On the night of December 3 last year, Zhang suddenly said that he would go to Hangzhou the next day. When asked what he was going to do, he did not answer. She asked to go with him, but was refused. The next day, she sent him to the train station and saw that Zhang had bought a ticket to Nanjing. Later, she learned that Ms. Yang was also in Nanjing and was living with her husband in the Jiaotong Hotel Room 27. Yang's mother was also in Nanjing. The express letter she sent to her was mailed from Xujiahui. Now, all the items in her house have been taken away. It is difficult to find the receipt for this express letter. Please investigate the guest name book of the hotel, which will be able to prove the facts she described.</p>
<p>Yang said that she was also quite apologetic to Yu Lawyer Li then presented the two letters written by Yang Xuejiu to the court. Judge Cheng glanced at them and handed them to Yang for review and asked if they were written by her. Yang admitted that the letters were sent to a friend with the surname Hu, asking him to investigate the attitude of Wuxi towards this matter. She said that she did not know that Xuelou was Zhang Nai at first, and that she realized that the so-called divorce that he had previously mentioned was actually his first marriage, not the current plaintiff. Therefore, she asked Hu to investigate. After the investigation, she was quite apologetic to Ms. Yu.</p>
<p>Ms. Yang is willing to sacrifice for love Judge Cheng instructed Yang, since you know that Zhang Nai came to divorce from Wuxi, Zhang has actually deceived you. Why don't you file a lawsuit against him? Yang replied that although she knew she had been deceived at this time, her feelings had not yet been broken. And since she has already sacrificed for love, she could not bear to proceed with the prosecution and instead sought a way to mediate.</p>
<p>A great debate arose over the issue of bail Lawyer Jiang then defended the defendant, saying that the defendant did not intentionally resist the summons. After receiving the telegram, she rushed back from Japan and arrived in court. What she said today is all true. She was also deceived by Zhang Nai. Judging from her open and honest attitude, it can be determined that she is not likely to flee. She should be allowed to post bail and wait for the summons outside. Lawyer Li expressed opposition, saying that based on the defendant's letters, it can be known that the defendant knew that Zhang Nai had a wife when she married him. The plaintiff still has various evidence that will be presented at the next hearing to further prove that the defendant's claim that she only returned to Shanghai from Japan on the 18th is not credible. The plaintiff knows that the defendant has been in Shanghai for a long time. All of this can be investigated. Therefore, at a minimum, the defendant must post a shop guarantee.</p>
<p>Released on ordinary bail to be available upon summons Judge Cheng then ruled that the defendant, Yang Xuejiu, be released on ordinary bail to be available upon summons. The next hearing was rescheduled for 3:00 PM next Tuesday afternoon. Yang's relatives who were in court to listen to the hearing posted the ordinary bail bond in court yesterday afternoon and were temporarily released on bail.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Danger</h3>
<p>Flipping Opera Party Active</p>
<p>Xie Xunxia was deceived but did not publicize it</p>
<p>The captain of the Weihai ship is relatively shrewd</p>
<p>Paper money stacked up to tens of thousands</p>
<p>These moths should be severely punished</p>
<p>The world famous master player willing to bet one cent and determine the result Xie Xunxia (also known as Xie Xuan) from Pingyang, Zhejiang is skilled in the art of chess and has no equal. Xie has a bookstore in Shanghai and his family lives at 222 North Sichuan Road. Last month, two people suddenly came to his store saying they wanted to buy books. Xie and Kuan chatted and learned that they were from the same hometown. They were extremely welcoming to each other and after some pleasantries, they learned that the two guests were named Li Xianting and Pan Guozhong who lived in room 65 of the New New Hotel. Since then, they have been in contact with each other. On the 17th of last month, Li and Pan visited Xie again and said that a Japanese was also good at chess and admired Jun's name and wanted to bet one cent to determine the result. Xie happily displayed his skills because he found a true friend. They agreed to meet at 10 a.m. the next day in room 65 of New New.</p>
<p>There was no chess set and no intention of playing chess When they arrived on time, they glimpsed the name of the resident of New New on the guest plate of room 65 which had changed to the surname Wang. They intended to approach the room and ask about the reason for the change of surname. When they reached the door of room 65, they saw Pan waiting outside the door. They were invited to enter and besides Li and Pan, there were two other guests. After Li introduced them, they learned that one was Taiwanese Cai Tingbang and the other only knew his surname was Liu. Looking around, there was no chess set and everyone showed no intention of playing chess, so they asked Li about it.</p>
<p>A pistol was suddenly drawn demanding 5,000 yuan At this moment, Liu suddenly closed the door tightly and shouted at Xie, "Your business is going very smoothly and we are extremely impoverished. We have spent a lot of energy and effort to detect your preferences, so we have specially invited you to come here with words. We don't want to play chess, we want to borrow 5,000 yuan. You have already been caught. If you don't agree, I'm afraid it will be difficult for you to return." Xie was fearless after hearing this and told him that he was not a rich merchant, how could he have thousands of gold. If you don't believe me, you can dispose of me. Seeing Xie's strong attitude, Liu took out a pistol and threatened him in every possible way. The two sides faced each other for a long time and Xie agreed to give 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>They got 750 yuan with a voucher only because they did not carry the money with them, so they wrote an IOU. Those people then sent their party to Xie's house to collect it. After a while, the person who took the money returned and said that they only got 750 yuan. Those people then kidnapped Xie and went to Ma Huo Road before letting him go. Before leaving, they told Xie not to report to the police, otherwise there would be more severe measures to deal with him, so Xie kept the secret as if it were a deep ear. It has been a long time and he only occasionally revealed it to his relatives and friends, but those people have not been seen. It is believed that they have fled, but in fact, Li and others are still in the concession practicing their intimidation career.</p>
<p>The captain of the Weihai ship came to Shanghai because of this It has now been detected that Wu Jian, the captain of the Weihai ship of the Northeast Fleet and a native of Pingyang, came to Shanghai for official business at the beginning of this month and stayed in room 1 of the Nanjing Hotel on Edward Road. At 10 a.m. the other day, Li Xianting, also known as Wang Liyu, and Huang Lushen from Fujian went to visit Wu. At that time, because they were from the same hometown, he agreed to see them even though they had never met before. Li then said that his master had assets of tens of millions and many concubines. Now, the third concubine had taken a huge amount of money and taken the master's son to Yantai. Because he knew that the teacher had been stationed there for the longest time, he came to ask him to pay attention to it. Wu immediately agreed.</p>
<p>They agreed to go and see the runaway concubine's photos Li also said that the photos of the runaway concubine were still in room 417 of the Oriental Hotel where he lived and asked him to come along and view them so that he would not be confused when they met in the future. At this time, Wu felt that Li was too casual and was pestering someone he didn't know. He was very suspicious. He suddenly recalled what his friend Li Chuqun had said about Xie Xunxia being deceived. He carefully examined Li's face and it was very similar to the face of the deceiver mentioned by Li's friend. He did not reveal his expression and agreed to visit the East in the afternoon to return the visit. Li and Huang happily left.</p>
<p>Report to the detectives and arrest three people Wu then asked someone to invite Xie to his residence to inquire about the details of the deception. He expected that Wang Liyu was Li Xianting. He reported it to the Old Gate Patrol Room and dispatched detectives Liang Chengyu and Wang Shusen to rush to the East to arrest Li Pan Huang</p>

<h3>Continued Capture of Li Song and a Taiwanese Man</h3>
<p>During the search of the room, the suitcase was found to contain banknotes from the Bank of the Underworld, totaling 25,000 yuan. Subsequently, Li’s adoptive father, Li Song, and a Taiwanese man, Cai Tingbang, were apprehended and brought back to the police station. The police chief interrogated them. According to Li's statement, his real name is Wang Xianting, while Zhu Lian stated that he was a staff officer in the Zhenjiang Fortress Command. He had taken leave to visit his friend at the Youhua Hotel in Shanghai. Wang Xianting visited Zhu at the Youhua Hotel a few days ago. Hearing of this, Li came out to meet them. Although they did not know each other, they were fellow villagers, so they started talking. Wang then invited him to his residence for a chat to relieve boredom, which led to his arrest.</p>
<p>The Taiwanese man was handed over to the Japanese consulate. Xie also went to the police station to declare that Zhu Lian was definitely not present when he was swindled. The police chief released Zhu. Cai Tingbang, being of Taiwanese籍, was instructed to be escorted to the Japanese领事馆 for interrogation. The remaining four people were escorted to the Special District Court yesterday morning, where Judge Xu presided over the interrogation. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that Wang Xianting and others were being prosecuted under Article 370 of the Criminal Law, requesting strict punishment.</p>
<p>Bank of the Underworld Notes Used as Chips According to Wang Xianting's statement, he told Xie at the time that there was a Japanese man who was good at Go, referring to Cai Tingbang. Later, Cai was unwilling to play Go, so they switched to gambling on "One Two Three Four." Xie lost 1,250 yuan and, after repaying 750 yuan, still owed 500 yuan. Bank of the Underworld notes were used as chips during the gambling. Judge Xu then questioned the other defendants one by one and ordered them to be remanded in custody for another seven days for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Blackmail of Shanghai College President Liu Zhanen</h3>
<p>The Bandit Zhou Amao Apprehended</p>
<p>Liu Zhanen, Exhausted, Reports to the Police Station</p>
<p>Many Detectives Disguised, Ambushing from All Sides</p>
<p>Negotiation on the Third Floor of the Central Hotel</p>
<p>Beer Bottle as Signal, Plan Not Secret</p>
<p>Liu Zhanen, President of Shanghai College in Yangshupu, received a blackmail letter from bandits a month ago demanding a large sum of money. Liu ignored it. A few days ago, another letter arrived with very strong language, stating that if he continued to ignore it, they would resort to final and appropriate means. They also arranged a meeting place on the third floor of the Central Hotel on Zhengfeng Street, Hubei Road, with a beer bottle as a signal. Liu, under the pressure of the bandits' forces, had no choice but to report the situation to the General Inspectorate of the Central Police Station and request an investigation. Liu Shaokui, Chief of the General Inspectorate of the Central Police Station, upon hearing the news, secretly dispatched detectives disguised as ordinary people and personally led Chinese and foreign detectives to wait on the third floor of the Central Hotel yesterday afternoon. After a while, someone came to meet him, and he was immediately arrested. As the jurisdiction of the hotel belongs to the Old Gate Police Station, the blackmailing bandit, Zhou Amao from Ningbo, was temporarily detained at the police station and scheduled to be transferred to the court for investigation tomorrow.</p>

The architect drawing up the plans for the building is Gang Da, and everything is extremely novel and beautiful. Once completed, it will likely be the most magnificent and tallest building in the Far East.</p>

<h3>Armed Robberies Active in the Public Concession</h3>
<p>Residents Should Be Careful</p>
<p>The "Great American Evening News" reports that armed robberies have been quite active in this city recently. Yesterday (the 19th), there were several incidents in the Public Concession, and the stolen goods were all very small, indicating that these people do not spare even small items, which is also a worrying sign for society. Yesterday evening, three thieves entered a small foreign goods store at No. 80 Yunnan Road. One of them brandished a gun, frightening the shopkeeper and stealing goods worth 20 yuan. Yesterday morning, seven thieves entered a Chinese residence at No. 712 East-West Huade Road. Three of them brandished guns and stole a small amount of cash and several pieces of clothing and jewelry. Last night, three thieves, two of them brandishing guns, entered a small money shop at No. 260 Guling Road and stole 400 yuan in cash before escaping. Today (the 20th) this morning, four thieves attempted to rob a certain number on Diswei Road, but fortunately, a neighbor heard the commotion and reported it to the police, so the thieves escaped without causing any losses.</p>
<h3>Shipping Magnate Da Lai Coming to Shanghai as Scheduled</h3>
<p>October 3rd</p>
<p>Robert Dollar, the American shipping magnate, has seventeen giant ships on the Pacific route. In recent years, competition with British and Japanese shipping merchants in Sino-American shipping has been fierce, especially this year. This year, imports and exports on this route are even more lacking. Dollar has also invested 30 million US dollars to build two large mail ships, 625 feet long and with a displacement of 35,000 tons, with a speed of 21 nautical miles per hour. The ships are also equipped with airplanes, opening a new era in Far East shipping. Recently, one of the two new ships will be completed by the end of this year. Dollar, in order to expand Pacific shipping, is personally visiting major ports around the world. He arrived in Shanghai from San Francisco yesterday on his company's Madison轮. According to a telegram, he is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on October 3rd. Shi Ting, a senior executive of the Shanghai office, has already gone to Japan to welcome him and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on October 3rd. American businessmen in Shanghai will hold a meeting to welcome him after his arrival.</p>
<h3>Current Status of Grain Transportation</h3>
<p>Hunan Rice: Almost No Hunan Rice Transported to Shanghai (Hunan Rice Eased Restrictions) A small portion was first loaded starting on August 22. It was reported that the original plan was to load one million shi to Shanghai and two million shi to Nanhua ports by the end of this year. However, because the Hunan government had to extract an exit passport tax of five yuan per bag, the grain merchants in various places believed that the cost was too high due to the heavy tax, so they all stopped collecting and transporting. They unanimously demanded a reduction in the exit passport tax, but the Hunan government, due to budget concerns, has not agreed to reduce it, resulting in the suspension of Hunan rice exports. Recently, there has been no Hunan rice loaded on the upper Yangtze River ships for transshipment to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Jiangxi and Anhui Continue to Have Rice Arriving: After Jiangxi rice was allowed to be exported on September 1, several batches have been continuously transported to Shanghai from Jiujiang, totaling 20,000 to 30,000 bags. Yesterday, two more batches, totaling more than 6,800 bags, arrived on British and Japanese Yangtze River ships and have been unloaded at the Hongkou warehouse. Anhui Rice: Recently, with the new rice coming onto the market in Wuhu, southern Anhui, 600 bags of Anhui rice have been transported to Shanghai for the first time. (Note: Anhui rice has not been transported here for a long time, so this is the first batch to arrive in Shanghai.)</p>
<h3>County Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>Apprehends Taixing Bandit Gang</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received a document from the Taixing County Government政务 police a few days ago, stating that bandit gangs have been rampant in the county, disrupting the local area, and that all firearms were purchased and transported from Shanghai. Knowing that many bandits were hiding in Shanghai, they brought along informants to Shanghai to apprehend them and requested assistance. County Chief Yan immediately ordered Director Shen of the Public Security Bureau to personally lead Captain Qi of the Detective Team and others to first capture Lu Zhang'er at the Shanghai-Taicang Railway Station. They immediately took him to the bureau for interrogation. According to his confession, the bandit gang's headquarters was located in Liuhe. Therefore, Director Shen led the entire detective team, all armed, in automobiles to Liuhe that night. Unexpectedly, the bandit gang had already heard the news, so there was no one in the headquarters. Later, they saw a young bandit, Zhang Hongjing, thirteen or fourteen years old, wandering around there, so they detained him. After questioning him, they learned that the bandit gang was hiding in the town's inns. They went to the inns and captured four bandits. They escorted all the captured bandits back to Shanghai to the bureau overnight for interrogation. They confessed that there were still accomplices hiding in Tangqiao, Pudong. Yesterday morning, they sent detectives to arrest one more bandit and ordered them to be detained together pending instructions. The names of the seven bandits captured are: 1. Lu Zhang'er, 2. Zhang Hongren, 3. Wang Koushan, 4. Wang Tianfu, 5. Liu Zixiang, 6. Xu Mingzhou, 7. Zhou Shougen. The Pengpu Township Defense Corps also captured seven people, including Diao Yutang, a few days ago, and they have now been transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Therefore, the County Public Security Bureau ordered detectives to go and pick them up yesterday afternoon so that they could be escorted to Taixing for trial. However, the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau stated that they had not been pre-trialed and did not understand the situation, so they were ordered to be temporarily detained. It was later learned that the County Public Security Bureau is scheduled to send detectives to escort the captured bandits to the Taixing County Government for trial today, Sunday.</p>
<h3>Stolen Car Recovered</h3>
<p>Liu Tongyun, manager of Fuji Paper Store at No. 45 Chun Geng Lane, Shandong Road, was kidnapped by bandits the night before, and his car, number 6233, was driven away by the bandits at the same time. After a thorough investigation by the police stations, it was discovered on Ma Lang Road in the French Concession yesterday morning. The patrol police reported it, and the French police forwarded it to the Central Police Station, which has ordered the owner to retrieve it.</p>
<h3>Chiang Wan-chen's Opium Paraphernalia Confiscated</h3>
<p>Chiang Wan-chen Fined 450 Yuan</p>
<p>Lu Zhu's Family Fined 500 Yuan</p>
<p>Jiang Wan-chen, a woman from Shantou, and Zhu, the wife of the comedian Lu, lived together at No. 3 Shantou Road. Because both privately possessed opium paraphernalia and Zhu also possessed opium, the police searched and allowed each to pay a cash bail of 500 yuan. The Special District Court summoned Chiang and Zhu, but both failed to appear. The news of their changed hearing dates was previously reported. Zhu still failed to appear during the continued trial yesterday morning, while Chiang Wan-chen came to court with lawyer Ni Jiong. Chiang was still young and, without makeup, her face looked sallow. However, Chiang firmly claimed that the opium paraphernalia belonged to her grandmother, and lawyer Ni defended her, saying that Chiang Wan-chen's grandmother, Zhou Huang, was old and sick. Whenever she came to Shanghai, she stayed at Chiang's house, and when she fell ill, she had to smoke opium. The paraphernalia actually belonged to her. Chiang admitted it was hers because she wanted to avoid punishment for her grandmother. This is forgivable. Judge Shen then sentenced Chiang Wan-chen to a fine of 450 yuan and Lu Zhu's family to a fine of 500 yuan, and the opium paraphernalia was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Zhu Mintang's Check Case Withdrawn</h3>
<p>Zhang Xiaolin and lawyer Jin Yu accused Zhu Mintang of issuing a bad check from a certain bank for 1,070 yuan, which was returned upon maturity. They requested the French Concession Public Court to investigate and recover the amount. After Zhu was detained at the police station, Zhu's family found a guarantor for 1,500 yuan to bail him out. Zhu's father also asked friends to settle the check amount with Zhang. Yesterday, when this case was tried in the French Concession Public Court, the plaintiff's lawyer, Jin Yu, requested the court to allow the check case to be withdrawn.</p>
<h3>Wharf Thugs Demand Overnight Fees</h3>
<p>Wang Ahua Arrested and Taken to Court</p>
<p>Recently, in the Pujiang area of ​​the South City, a group of vagrants have been found. Every time various cargo ships arrive at the port and have not yet unloaded, they spend the night in the Pujiang River waiting to be unloaded the next morning. They form gangs and extort money from the cargo ship owners, calling it "overnight fees," ranging from two or three yuan to an uncertain amount. Therefore, the shipowners are all suffering from it. The night before, a ship carrying raw salt materials from the Wu Gan Jingyan Company from another port was moored next to the Dachu Warehouse Wharf. In the evening, many hooligans from Shaoxing, including Wang Ahua (陈阿华), extorted the aforementioned overnight fee. The ship's crew, fearing their ferocity, dared not resist and secretly went to report the situation to the Water Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and requested an arrest. Detectives were dispatched and arrested Ahua. After taking him to the team, he was ordered to prepare a document to be sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Chen Jigen Dies from Gunshot Wound</h3>
<p>Chen Jigen, who lived at No. 66, Xinmin Road, Tangshan Road, went out at 7 PM on the 9th of this month to his uncle's house along the river. On the way, he suddenly heard a gunshot behind him. Just as he was about to turn around, a bullet entered his back, and blood flowed like a torrent. Chen ran with the wound to his uncle's house and was sent by car to Tongren Hospital for treatment. After examination by the doctor, it was found that the gunshot wound was quite serious, and he died at 3 AM the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo of the Special District Court went to the scene to investigate. He took his seat and said that the Western police reported that the case seemed to be an assassination, with no other suspicions. However, it was doubtful that the deceased was able to run such a long distance after suffering such a serious gunshot wound. Mr. Guo then asked the sister of the deceased, Mao Chen, if the deceased had any enemies outside. She replied that she did not know. He then concluded that Chen Jigen was indeed shot and assassinated while alive. The police station was ordered to strictly apprehend the murderer and bring them to justice. The corpse was handed over to Mao Chen for coffin burial.</p>
<h3>One Woman Married Twice</h3>
<p>Gan Hongqing Extremely Frustrated</p>
<p>Gan Liangzhen Unable to Accept It</p>
<p>Gan Liangzhen from Nanjing has a son named Gan Hongqing, who is 28 years old this year. In 1926, Gan Liangzhen hired Xu Guisheng as a matchmaker in Shanghai to betroth the daughter of Wang Yaoting, a fellow villager living in Xieqiao, as his daughter-in-law. The woman is 21 years old this year. At that time, because the woman was only 16 years old and not yet of marriageable age, it was agreed to marry in three years. Unexpectedly, in 1927, Wang Yaoting received a better proposal from another family and remarried his daughter to another family. She has now given birth and become a mother. However, after the three-year agreement of Gan Liangzhen and his son expired, they came to Shanghai to welcome the bride, but Wang's family had already moved and their whereabouts were unknown. A great marriage was ruined. Gan Hongqing was frustrated and wanted to die, and left home. Nothing in his life could be more unsatisfactory than this. Gan Liangzhen, unable to marry a daughter-in-law and angered by the departure of his beloved son, felt unable to accept it. Therefore, he looked for the matchmaker Xu Guisheng to argue and investigate, but Xu was a matchmaker from the Qian family and had no major responsibility, so Gan could do nothing. However, Xu was also unwilling to interfere in other people's affairs. On the day before yesterday, he found out that Wang lived in Zhuangjia Road in Ximen and notified Gan Liangzhen to go to Wang's house to ask for marriage. Wang was shocked and honestly said that he was willing to pay a subsidy of 40 yuan to cancel the marriage agreement. However, Gan felt that the loss was too small and refused to agree to discuss it further. Fearing that Wang would escape, he ordered a guarantor to be found. Jin Changqi, a neighbor, acted as a guarantor and agreed to continue negotiations yesterday. Unexpectedly, Wang avoided the trouble and hid. Gan then twisted Jin and accused him at the First Section of the Second District and handed Wang Yaoting over to the District Court for trial.</p>
<h3>Lu Chen Suddenly Flees</h3>
<p>Due to Economic Pressure</p>
<p>Lu Chen, a 45-year-old woman from Jiangwan, lived at No. 449, Kuisha Road, Jiangwan. Recently, due to economic pressure, she was heavily in debt and unable to maintain her current situation. She suddenly fled the day before yesterday, and her whereabouts are unknown. Her son, Lu Lizi, feared that she would commit suicide by throwing herself into the river, so he reported to the Water Patrol Police Station yesterday and requested them to pay attention.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Breaks Apprentice's Leg</h3>
<p>At around 9 PM the night before last, Hong Shuihuo, a 16-year-old apprentice of the Aihua Company from Danyang, was walking on South China Road in Ximen when he was hit by a Chinese public bus. He was unable to avoid it and was knocked down, breaking his right leg and losing consciousness. The patrol police from the Second Section of the Second District arrived and helped send the injured person to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. The driver who caused the accident was taken to the police station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Tugboat Capsizes Sampan</h3>
<p>One Person Drowns</p>
<p>Jiang Yushan, a 40-year-old tea server from Yangzhou on the Taigu Company's Xiamen-bound Taiyuan輪船, hired a sampan No. 837 at the French Company Wharf at 12 PM on the 16th of this month to cross to Pudong to board the ship. There were a total of three passengers, including Jiang, in the same boat. Unexpectedly, when they arrived near the Japanese warship浮筒 in the center of the Pujiang River, a tugboat of the Da Lai Company came speeding by. Due to poor visibility in the darkness, it accidentally capsized the sampan. All passengers, including Jiang, fell into the water. Neighboring ships rescued the passengers separately, but only Jiang drowned in the river and his body disappeared. It wasn't until傍晚 the day before yesterday that it floated up at the Taigu Wharf in the French Concession. Chinese policeman No. 26 of the Water Patrol Police Station saw it and had the corpse salvaged by the Life Saving Bureau and notified the family to collect the body.</p>
<h3>Robbery with Violence</h3>
<p>At 8:10 PM last night, three thugs invaded No. 163 North Henan Road. One of them, speaking with a Jiangbei accent, held a handgun and forbade the victim from making a sound. They robbed 61 silver dollars. The victim reported the robbery to the police station and requested an investigation. At 8:40 PM last night, three thieves came to the Yuanhe Tin Foil Shop at No. 241 Zhili Road. One of them held a handgun and was about to search the place when the victim secretly went out and called the patrol police to come. One thief was caught on the spot and taken to the police station for investigation. Fortunately, there were no losses.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>Xujiahui Observatory, 4:30 PM yesterday, weather forecast: The coastal area and the Yangtze River basin are cloudy and cool.

<h3>Education News</h3>
<p>Important News</p>
<p>Ministry of Education</p>
<p>Retaining Chen Bulei, Director of the Zhejiang Education Department</p>
<p>Chen Bulei, Director of the Zhejiang Education Department, once again submitted a request to the Ministry of Education to resign. The Ministry of Education earnestly retained him and ordered him to do his best and not to entertain any thoughts of resignation.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Investigates Secondary Education</h3>
<p>In order to investigate the educational status of secondary schools in various provinces and cities for the purpose of statistical collation, the Ministry of Education has specially formulated an investigation form and issued a general order to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities. The "Certain Secondary School Investigation Statistical Form" and the "Certain City Education Department and Bureau Secondary School Investigation Statistical Form" are recorded below, along with the instructions for filling them out.</p>
<h3>Explanation of the Statistical Form for Certain Secondary Schools in the Eighteenth Year</h3>
<p>1. The form is 44 cm high and 30 cm wide.</p>
<p>2. This form is applicable to all types of secondary schools. Each school must fill it out itself and submit it to the ministry and bureau for forwarding. In addition to sending one part to the ministry, the ministry and bureau that it passes through must have a copy for compilation and statistical collation.</p>
<p>3. After filling in the name of the province, city, and county at the top of the form, fill in provincial, municipal, county, or private, and then fill in the school name. If there is no "middle school" in the name, the two words "middle school" in the table should be crossed out.</p>
<p>4. The method of filling in the grades and departments in the student column: one department occupies one space, and the name of the department and the total number of grades are recorded. For example, if a junior high school has three grades and a total of eleven classes, it should be filled in as "Junior High School Department, a total of eleven grades, so many boys, so many girls, so many in total" (the total number of eleven grades). The order of arrangement of each department: first junior high school, then senior high school general department, then senior high school normal department, then senior high school agricultural department, then senior high school industrial department, then senior high school commercial department, then household affairs department, then rural normal school or short-term normal training class, then vocational department.</p>
<p>5. The statistics of graduates start from 1918, because there were statistics from the former Beijing Education Department before 1918, but after that, they were missing. Although this form is a statistical table for 1929, this column may as well go back ten years. The files of each school are there for inspection, which is not difficult, and the ministry will communicate and integrate to facilitate verification. Each school that was established later and only has graduates after 1918 should fill in the graduates of the first year.</p>
<p>6. Full-time and part-time teachers and staff: A full-time teacher is one who teaches only at this school and does not hold any position inside or outside the school. Otherwise, they are a part-time teacher. A full-time staff member is one who holds a position only at this school and does not hold any position inside or outside the school. Otherwise, they are a part-time staff member. If the principal also teaches a subject, they should be listed in both the part-time teacher and part-time staff sections.</p>
<p>7. Teachers and staff with degrees from normal universities in the two columns of teachers and staff refer to those who graduated from a normal university and obtained a bachelor's degree. Those who graduated from the higher normal school department of the normal university should be classified as graduates of a higher normal school.</p>
<p>8. University graduates refer to those who graduated from a university undergraduate program and obtained a bachelor's degree. Those who graduated from a specialty within the university are classified as graduates of a technical school. Preparatory graduates are classified as other.</p>
<p>9. The total number of teachers and staff should be counted by individual people, and the duplicate number should be omitted. For example, if the total number of full-time male teachers is eight and the total number of part-time teachers is five, then the total number is thirteen. If the total number of full-time female teachers is twelve and the total number of part-time teachers is eight, then the total number is twenty. If the total number of full-time male staff is three and the total number of part-time staff is two, then the total number is five. If the total number of full-time female staff is six and the total number of part-time staff is four, then the total number is ten. If calculated according to the surface numbers, the total number of full-time male teachers and staff is eleven and the total number of part-time teachers and staff is seven, then the total number is eighteen. The total number of full-time female teachers and staff is eighteen and the total number of part-time teachers and staff is twelve, then the total number is thirty. The total number of full-time teachers and staff for men and women is twenty-nine, the number of part-time is nineteen, and the total number is forty-eight. However, upon investigation, the total number of male and female teachers and staff in the school can be 43. The error lies in the repeated appearance of part-time workers. Two of the five part-time male teachers are also staff at this school. Three of the four part-time female staff are also teachers at this school. A total of five people appear repeatedly and should be removed. Therefore, each row in this column should be filled in as follows: Male: 11 full-time, 5 part-time; Female: 18 full-time, 9 part-time; Total: 29 full-time, 14 part-time; Total: 43. At the same time, the explanation column should indicate that there are two male staff members who are also teachers at this school and three female staff members who are also teachers at this school. Not only does the total number conform, but the number of male and female teachers and staff who are also working outside the school can also be inferred.</p>
<p>10. The amount of annual income and expenditure is in yuan, and the amount below yuan is omitted. 11. The total amount should be the sum of the following items and must not have any discrepancies. 12. The total amount of annual income and expenditure must include both the regular and temporary expenses for the current year.</p>
<p>13. The annual income of public schools only has one item: public funds. Tuition is collected on behalf of the government and is not another kind of income other than public funds. It can be left blank to avoid confusion. However, private schools, or public schools where tuition is indeed the direct income of the school, should fill it in.</p>
<p>14. The experimental and practice supplies in the expenditure column include the costs of experiments in physics, chemistry, and biology, and the cost of practice in crafts.</p>
<p>15. Office and miscellaneous expenses include all office expenses, wages for laborers and workers, and various miscellaneous expenses. If the school has debts, the interest paid is also recorded in this item.</p>
<p>16. Construction refers to newly added buildings and civil engineering repairs of 500 yuan or more. Repairs below 500 yuan are included in the miscellaneous expenses item.</p>
<p>17. The amount of expenses per student is the quotient of the total number of students in the current year divided by the total amount of expenditure, with two decimal places below yuan.</p>
<p>18. In the establishment month and year column, record the month and year the school was established. For those established before the founding of the Republic of China, use the dating method before the era of recording years.</p>
<p>19. In the year and month of registration, record the year and month of the most recent registration. Public schools do not fill in this column.</p>
<p>20. In the principal column, fill in the name, background, and full-time or part-time status of the principal. If it is part-time, what other duties are held should be noted.</p>
<p>21. If the student and graduate columns cannot be filled in on one paper, two papers can be used. When using two papers, the items below the teacher column must be recorded on the second paper.</p>

However, industrial nations cannot abandon agricultural policies because agriculture is the foundation of industry. China has traditionally regarded agriculture as the foundation of the nation and possesses various virtues of farmers. Therefore, China's economic construction should focus on agricultural policy at present.</p>

<h3>China Wins the Rober Cup Championship</h3>
<p>Defeats England Yesterday by a Score of Three to One</p>
<p>6-8, 6-2, 6-2, 6-2</p>
<p>The International Rober Cup tennis tournament of the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club had participants from China, England, Portugal, the United States, and Japan. China first defeated Japan, then the United States. England defeated Portugal, so China and England reached the finals. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, they competed for the final championship at the French Club. The Chinese representatives were Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai, and the English representatives were Whit and Stock. Four to five hundred spectators were present, making it a grand occasion. After a four-set battle, China won the championship with a score of 6-8, 6-2, 6-2, 6-2. The details are as follows.</p>
<h3>A Brief History of the Rober Cup</h3>
<p>The Rober Cup was established in 1921 to commemorate the late Mr. Rober. It was initially a doubles competition, with each country allowed to enter only one team. From 1912 to 1927, England won the championship four times and each other country had won it three times. Starting in 1928, it was officially changed to an international competition, and China joined that year, achieving good results. Portugal won two consecutive championships. This year, China sent Lin and Qiu to compete. The two players have outstanding skills and swept across Shanghai, invincible everywhere they went. Since their debut, they have repeatedly defeated strong opponents and won the championship, making history for the Chinese tennis community in Shanghai. This is truly something to celebrate.</p>
<h3>The Skills of Both Sides</h3>
<p>Yesterday's China-England final was a fierce competition. England's Whit is a veteran of the sea, and Stock is a rising star. They aimed to defeat Lin and Qiu to win the championship. They indeed won the first set with a score of 6-8. However, Lin and Qiu displayed the unpredictable skills of famous generals on the battlefield. After many wonderful points, they won the next three sets in a row, with the scores all being 6-2. This was truly remarkable. Lin Baohua's serving skills were excellent. In the four sets, he won as many as six games solely through his serves, which was commendable. Qiu Feihai showed some timidity, and his control was somewhat lacking. However, in the third and fourth sets, he regained his form, making rapid and decisive shots, earning the praise of the audience. England's Whit performed as usual, and Stock ran and covered a lot of ground, making great contributions. Stock's performance contributed significantly to England's results.</p>
<h3>The Competitive Situation</h3>
<p>First set, serving order: 1. Whit, 2. Lin Baohua, 3. Stock, 4. Qiu Feihai. England won the first game. Lin's serving with a slice won him a game. Then England added three games to make it 3-1. Lin and Qiu battled to a tie. England added two more games to make it 5-3. The Chinese team seemed to be in danger. Fortunately, they worked hard and were finally able to retaliate to tie the game at 5-5 (Lin won the tenth game with a slice). However, it was quite difficult. After that, it became 7-6. The Chinese team was still at a disadvantage. At that time, it was Lin Baohua's turn to serve, and it was thought that it would not be difficult to make it 7-7. Unexpectedly, Baohua, who is usually known for his fierce serves, had bad luck and could not fulfill his wish. England then won the first set 8-6 and got The Rober Cup Championship Left: Lin Baohua Right: Qiu Feihai (photographed by this newspaper)</p>
<p>Second set, serving order: 1. Stock, 2. Lin Baohua, 3. Whit, 4. Qiu Feihai. Lin and Qiu's sharpness gradually increased, and the situation turned around. They won four games in a row. Lin won a game with a slice. The English team tried hard to counterattack, winning two games. Lin and Qiu added two more games to win 6-2. The serving order for the third set was the same as the second. Qiu Feihai's shots were like arrows, repeatedly making great contributions. Lin Baohua's serves were like cannonballs, creating two more slices, robbing the English team, on the third game, making it a 5-1 lead, though the English tried and struggled, it was difficult to turn the tide, and so Lin and Qiu again winning with 6-2.</p>
<p>In the fourth set, Lin and Qiu lost fewer points, and the English team appeared scattered. Although they won the first game, they then lost five games in a row. At this point, the victory of the Chinese team was within their grasp. As a result, Lin and Qiu won again with 6-2, winning the Rober Cup.</p>
<h3>Women's Singles Competition Not Held</h3>
<p>After the group competition, there was originally a women's singles championship final. China's Li Xinghua lost to Martin in the semi-finals. Yesterday's final was supposed to be between Miss Fees and Martin. However, Miss Fees was unable to play due to illness, so it was canceled and will be held at a later date. At that time, China's Lin Baohua and England's Whit will play against China's Qiu Feihai and England's Stock in an exhibition doubles match. The enthusiasm for tennis is certainly high.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Teacher (to a student): You've been studying for several years. How come you still can't write an essay well? Look at this commentary of yours. The writing has no brilliance, and the theory is very far-fetched.</p>
<p>Student: If I go home and tell my father this, won't he get angry?</p>
<p>Teacher: You just need to tell your father that you didn't do well this time and that you'll be more diligent in the future.</p>
<p>Student: That won't work. Because this essay was actually written entirely by my father for me.</p>
<p>A: Practicing the latest form of flexible gymnastics is the way to health. It can make the body healthy and extend life.</p>
<p>B: But there was no such thing as flexible gymnastics in ancient times. What about our ancestors?</p>
<p>A: That's why they're all dead now.</p>
<p>Music Student: Teacher, how do you think my voice sounds? Can it still be used?</p>
<p>Music Teacher: I think that if a fire were to break out in your house in the future, then your voice could be used to alert the neighbors.</p>
<p>Mother: Good child, don't help me anymore. Every time you help me, you always break one or two dishes.</p>
<p>Daughter: Mother, that's helping. If I break more dishes for you, then you can wash fewer next time.</p>
<h3>Bo Baekke's Talk on Reforming China</h3>
<p>— Jie Fei</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Baekke, the American legal advisor to the National Government, was a close friend of Dr. Sun Yat-sen before his death and a firm believer in the Three Principles of the People. He is planning to return to the United States to advocate for the abolition of unequal treaties for China and has many plans for the development of China's state-owned enterprises. Recently, he spoke about the reformation of China at the Central Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. His words were earnest and his good intentions are commendable. (The following is a record of Mr. Lin Baekke's words.)</p>
<p>The reformation of China requires the participation of foreigners, which has long been absolutely rejected by the United States. However, for the development of China's economy to be successful, it must rely on American assistance. Americans who have come to China have historically held two attitudes: malicious aggression and benevolent assistance. Missionaries belong to the former. I have severely criticized this point to the government. As for the second attitude, it is what I should do my best to support. For centuries, China has suffered from the aggression of the great powers, leading to this prolonged decline, unable to extricate itself from deep waters and scorching fires. Although it is China's illness, it is also the world's illness. The world is like a human body. If one organ is sick, the whole body will be affected. China's weakness is enough to cause instability in the world, so the great powers should assist China's development, which is also their duty. Considering today's great powers, only the United States can provide assistance in China's economic development. I am returning to my country this time to work hard on this matter. You are now students. Everyone has a responsibility for the development of China. You should prepare yourselves at this time to be loyal in the future. What you should pay attention to is being loyal to the country, loyal to the school, loyal to Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and to the Three Principles of the People he created, and even loyal to the principal of your school. If everyone is loyal, then China's prosperity can be expected soon, and unequal treaties can also be abolished without difficulty.</p>
<p>Jie An: Mr. Lin, as a foreigner, exhorts us to be loyal and use it as a tool for the future development of China. The people of the country should understand his satire and know what to be cautious about.</p>
<h3>Talking about Jumping Jia Guan</h3>
<p>— Tuo Gong</p>
<p>It is said that the theatrical performance of jumping Jia Guan is about Sun Shu Ao, the Chu prime minister in the Spring and Autumn Period. Meng learned that Shu Ao's son was poor, so he dressed in the prime minister's clothes and sang to enlighten the king. The world therefore associated it with him. I once heard from Historian Wang Zhixiang of Taicang that Jia Guan is a false official. Later generations harmonize the sound to flatter the rich and powerful. Liao Yingzhong's Jiangxing Miscellany says that actresses have a play of playing false officials. The one in green clothes holding a brief is called the Canjun Zhuang. This is proof of it. In ancient times, they wore green clothes, but now they wear red robes. The so-called holding a brief still remains the same today, that is, holding an ivory tablet on stage. Canjun Zhuang, or it is said that Zhuang is a borrowed word for dressing up. Also, Duan Anjie's Yuefu Miscellany says that during the Kaiyuan period, the actors Huang Fanchuo and Zhang Yefu played Canjun. It was already called Canjun in the Tang Dynasty. The historian also said that Mr. Wu Meicun's Yuanhu Song has a line that says "Snow-faced Canjun dances with starlings," which refers to jumping Jia Guan. The mask used by Jia Guan on stage today is as white as snow, so it is called snow-faced. Jia Guan is a common name, while Canjun is elegant. Dance is jumping. Wang Dao of the Jin Dynasty said to Xie Shang, "I heard that you can do the starling dance." The whole audience wanted to see it. Shang got up, put on his clothes and hat, and asked the audience to beat time. No one else mattered. The "dancing with starlings" mentioned in Mr. Meicun's poem is based on this. A guest asked me about the origin of jumping Jia Guan, so I recounted what I heard.</p>
<h3>Obituary of Ms. Mao Jianpei</h3>
<p>— Ji Cheng sent from the dove</p>
<p>Ms. Mao Jianpei suddenly passed away by poisoning. As a smart, capable, and enterprising young woman, her death has been mourned by all who knew her and those who did not. I knew Jianpei a few years ago. At that time, Jianpei's best friends, Ms. Ou Jingfen and Ms. Pei Fen, were also very close to Ms. Li Minghui. Minghui knew Jianpei through the two Ous, and I knew Jianpei through Minghui. At that time, Jianpei had not yet learned Peking opera, and she was not involved in the film industry. She was innocent, lively, and only sometimes talked about family problems. She often said that her father and mother were not on good terms, and her mother was a defenseless woman. I have to help my mother and fight for the family. In fact, Mao Yunke was very strict in managing the family. What Jianpei said may also be a one-sided view.</p>
<p>When Jianpei first entered the film industry, Yunke had no idea. When the film company signed a contract with Jianpei, she always told them to send a notice in advance of when and where the filming would take place. The car could wait beside the house. I will come out myself. There is no need to come in and urge me. She was afraid that her father would find out. Later, Yunke gradually heard about it. One morning, when Jianpei was going to the Kaiyuan Company to film the marriage contract, Yunke suddenly stopped her. There was a conflict between father and daughter. Jianpei then took her mother out and lived in a room in Anlegong. I went to comfort her at that time. Jianpei's younger brother, Yanqiu, and the two Ou sisters were also in the room. Jianpei said at the time that she could support her mother with her meager ability. If she was not allowed to make movies, she vowed not to go home. She was very angry. Later, Yunke was comforted by friends and gradually calmed down. Jianpei also followed the advice of her best friends and brought her mother back home. Then Yunke allowed his daughter to make movies, and the staff of the film company were able to enter and leave the Mao residence openly and aboveboard.</p>
<p>Yunke had no intention of letting Jianpei learn opera at first. After this incident, because his beloved daughter was interested in drama, he hired a teacher to teach her. Because Jianpei was so smart, she could learn quickly. After that, the father-daughter relationship gradually returned to its original state. When she performed on the big stage, the audience was packed for three days, and there was a continuous stream of applause. Yunke was still not satisfied, so he went north to study under Wang Yaoqing. Recently, he performed on the Hanzhao stage, and his reputation was soaring. Unexpectedly, she suddenly died. I know how painful the old father must be.</p>
<p>Jianpei was smart throughout her life, but she was always arrogant and refused to bow her head, which was her biggest problem. Now I hear that she died from taking medicine after arguing with a certain gentleman, then Jianpei's death was not from anything else, but from her lifelong problem.</p>
<h3>Wang Yaoqing's Birthday News</h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master</p>
<p>The famous actor Wang Yaoqing (Yaoqing) is the leader of the pear garden industry. The number of his disciples is so large that even Chen Delin, who is famous as an old master, is ashamed of himself. On August 7th of the Gengwu year, for Yaoqing's 50th birthday celebration, his disciples Xun Huisheng, Cheng Yanqiu, Wang Yunfang, Xue Yanqin, Du Liyun, Hua Huilin, Xin Yanqiu, Ma Yanyun, etc., discussed to honor him with a title and offer him wine, and jointly solicit articles. The solicitation notice was written by a famous scholar in Peiping. The four-character phrases are beautiful and the six-character phrases are elegant. The text says, "Eighteen green waists, measure the French songs in the pear garden. Three thousand white hairs, lead the heroes in the Ju Department. The spring waves are slowly pulled, moving the lurking scales in the emerald marsh. The cool breeze is suddenly high, foretelling the flying cranes on the Qiong feast. The jade is poured from the clustered cups, and the crisp tubes are accumulated with pearls. There are words in the raised cup, adding immeasurable luck. Our teacher, Yaoqing, Mr. Wang, was early in the Yu Ni, and late in planting peach and plum. When he danced in Huainan, his fragrant name entered the home of poets. Zhengbei first worked as an actor, and the song garden has already recorded his voice. The Hechuan Water Tune has been taught by Kunlun Ningbi Xingqing. He frequently called Fanchuo, and his dreams returned to the emperor's place. In the field of Heavenly Broad Music, he studied the inner family and made the purple cloud Lingbo. Selecting and harmonizing the sound, lingering in the new sound of silk and bamboo, changing the levy and moving the palace, touching the old feeling of Shuhe. The dull official pretended to be a woman, and the Western sound combined with a hundred generations of elders. The Lu women and the Qi children all faced north as the best of the time. The sheng is clear and the reed is warm, melting the spring in the crimson tent. The hairpin moves and the bracelet flies, coming to hold the gift of red makeup. The flute players are all his disciples. Famous officials who know music are mostly friends with him. He examines the sound in his spare time and indulges in ink for pleasure. The phoenix tail has several lines, occasionally imitating the incense-turning order, and the jellyfish silk has hundreds of widths, sometimes imitating the boneless picture. He carefully studies the inscriptions of the Shang Ding Zhou Yi, and is familiar with the origins of the Qin stele and Han carvings. The small building is shrouded in smoke and mist, as if entering the Langhuan Hall, casually commenting on calligraphy and painting, and doubting that he lives in the Baojin Zhai. In the clear autumn of August, on the first day of the fifth decade, a good time on the seventh day, with double blessings and double cultivation. The rising sun illuminates the colorful branches, and the Yiling is only half, and the new year begins again. The flower lamps are thrown around, and the fragrant balls follow the beat. The ruddy face and green hair always stay in the old people of Tianbao. The fairy music of the clouds and sea, repeating the story of Xuanhe. Huisheng and others have little talent and follow him on his travels. Auspicious words are jointly wished. In the depths of the colorful clouds, it looks like a fairy. Beautiful algae fly, treasure like stars and phoenix, enter the door and offer three hundred cups of wine. Call and step forward to ask for nine thousand poems in the flower. Li received to pay tribute, paid tribute to Duke Dou in different times, still belonged to the spring people, and saw Zhang Xu in his year, still many courtiers. I would like to wish the Jinquan talented man and the Yumiao lyricist to bestow a carved chapter and visit Dan Hu. The pen of Liling is gorgeous, able to open the flowers of Yishou, and the song of the Ying guest is high, which is the record of longevity. I hope to quote Yan Yu, dare to follow Cheng Wei."</p>
<p>Short News: Sea of Desire is a new great production of Wufa Company in 1930. The main actors are Florey, the male lead in the conflict between body and soul, and Betty Amen, the female star. It depicts the conflict between love and responsibility and inserts the love between mother and son. The plot is tortuous and bizarre. The performance is superb. The whole play is full of stimulation and temptation. From beginning to end, it is enthusiastic and tense. It is impeccable. The lingering and affectionate ending is particularly thought-provoking. It is heard that the film will be released on September 19th at the Paris Grand Theater. (Yun)</p>

<h3>南洋游記（五五）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>A Trip to the South Seas (55)</p>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>On the 21st, I took a public tram to the Kek Lok Si Temple. The city was hot and stuffy, and I wanted to study the social life of turtles. Along the way, the tram passed through coconut groves. I often saw the neat and tidy small plank houses of the Malay people. The coconut groves were covered with lush green vegetables. Such a new village would be very good if it were not subjected to capital suppression. Although the plank houses are small, they have phonographs. There are also Chinese houses. Although simple, the men and women who come out are neat and tidy. Only the women here are dyed in the Malay style, with thick powder on their faces, like whitewashed walls, like paintings, which is very inelegant and loses their original appearance. I arrived at the Kek Lok Si Temple to see the turtle pond under the pagoda. I paid close attention to the social life of the turtles. This turtle pond is about four or five zhang square. There are about a thousand turtles in it. The large ones can be three chi in diameter, and the small ones are only the size of an ordinary plate. Some are yellow, and some are white. They live very quietly. At 5 pm, the gardener put vegetable leaves in the water for them to eat. When they saw the vegetable leaves, they all raised their heads and came forward, as if being called by name. Some quietly lay beside the stones and did not come. They are hermits. They compete for the vegetable food, but not fiercely. Whoever gets it is their fate. The power of pushing and shoving is very weak. It is rare to see them biting each other like a pack of dogs. I asked someone who had lived here for a long time whether turtles fight. He said he had never seen it. I think this creature is very noble and quiet. Their society is not governed but not chaotic. Therefore, Fu Xi drew the eight trigrams according to the patterns on turtle shells, and all philosophy comes from the I Ching. Therefore, the sacred turtle is the ancestor of Eastern culture. Later generations, Yang Xiong, imitated the I Ching to write the Tai Xuan. Sima Guang spent thirty years annotating it. And Ziyun, in his "Explanation of Ridicule," said to his guests, "Now you ridicule the turtle dragon with a gecko, and you are claiming to be a turtle." In the Han Dynasty, there was the musician Li Guinian, in the Tang Dynasty, there was the literary man Lu Guimeng, and in the Song Dynasty, there was the Confucian scholar Yang Guishan. Today, many Japanese people have turtles as their surnames, such as Kamezawa Taro, Jiro, etc. Alas, the turtle society is a society of few desires and no contention, a society of perfect governance.</p>
<p>I also tried hard to observe whether the big turtles bullied the small turtles. Sometimes the small turtles crossed over the big turtles, and the big turtles did not care. It was like what I saw in Taiyuan. The cattle were eating grass, and flocks of birds flew onto the backs of the cattle. Flocks of birds also came to the troughs and ate with the cattle. The cattle did not hate them at all. There was also a hen raised in the Taiyuan Museum. It lived alone in a wooden house. The house had an inner and outer room. Its food was stored in the inner room. Many small sparrows came from outside. They entered its inner room and ate. They entered and exited from under the chicken's wings. The chicken did not care. The concept of ownership of cattle and chickens is so weak. Therefore, there is no need for legislators to stipulate hundreds of articles. If human morality were like that of birds and beasts...</p>
<h3>心上温馨（二八一）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>Heart's Warmth (281)</p>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Emerald Bamboo Tears Stain Her Face, Broken Heart / Red Lotus Fragrance Fades, A Maiden Soul Departs</p>
<p>This interrogation proved that everything he said was lies. But without real evidence, it was impossible to make a judgment at the time. But investigation was inevitable. Those detectives were even more厲害 than Sherlock Holmes of England. In just a few days, they had found out all his movements. But this wife was not the formal wife of Zhang Yiqing after all. She could not put on the airs of a principal wife. Only in her own house was her sovereignty absolute. She racked her brains on the opium couch. Thinking that Zhang Yiqing was so unfaithful, it was really hateful. She couldn't wait to make a big fuss with him. She had to tell the person he brought from outside to get the hell out. But on second thought, she couldn't act rashly. The current Zhang Yiqing was someone who could move on his own. He was not like before, when he was immobile and dependent on her. If she made too much noise and he couldn't turn around, she would suffer instead. People say that a cornered dog will jump over the wall. If he turned his face and said you are not my wife, it is none of your business, and kicked me over, I would not be able to settle this account with him. But making a fuss about it would not be fun. She had to think of another way. It was better to use soft methods than hard ones, subtle methods than crude ones. She would slowly clean them up. So she used methods to deceive him step by step, using sweet words to please him. When he said he was going on a boat ten days into this month, she still let him go. But she made it clear that the family already knew that he was not going on a boat. And she already knew where his small mansion was. Sometimes, she deliberately mentioned it in her words. Zhang Yiqing wanted to cover it up, but he could not. One day, she formally opened negotiations with Zhang Yiqing. She said, "I have known for a long time that you have someone outside. You don't need to hide it from me. A man is not forbidden to have three wives and four concubines as long as he can afford it. I only hope that you don't forget the old for the new. That would be good." Zhang Yiqing listened to her words, which sounded very pitiful, so he didn't say anything. Not saying anything was like tacitly acknowledging it. That wife continued, "Moreover, I am not your formal wife. I can't interfere with you. But because we used to be comrades in distress, I helped you. Now you men are nothing. We women are finished for life. Our reputations are ruined. We have no face to see the dead on the road to the underworld." Saying that, she lay on the pillow and sobbed. Women's tears are enough to melt a man's heart. After Zhang Yiqing took Cuiyun, he was prepared to break up with that unofficial wife if she made a lot of noise. He didn't expect her to use soft methods instead of hard ones.</p>

<p>Lingering Around the 40 Taels Mark: Yesterday, the 20th, the gold market remained hesitant, hovering around 540 taels. Overall, there were five taels and some cents of difference. Looking back, the situation was erratic and unpredictable. In general, the minds of the industry were divided, but there was a hidden upward trend. There was no sign of stability in foreign exchange. The buying and selling of various firms in the market varied greatly. Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Xing, Yong Tai, Kang Run, and speculators were selling, while Zhi Feng, Yong Yi, Yu Shun Li, Wan Xing, etc., were buying. Initially, the market price soared and exceeded the 40 taels mark, mainly because the silver market reported low prices and there was a profit of more than two taels afterward. However, due to the sudden tendency of speculators to sell, the market quickly weakened and fell by more than five taels. It fell from outside 43 taels to inside 38 taels. Later, the buyers were constantly seen chasing, so it has been pulled up by more than two taels to around 40 taels. In the afternoon, the market was closed as usual on Saturday.</p>

<p>Extreme Instability: The November contract opened at 540 taels and eight cents in the morning, an increase of 1 tael and 9 qian. Large bars were slightly down by one-sixteenth recently, and there was no change in the forward price. The silver price fell by a quarter. Then, due to someone selling, it fell by more than 1 tael to 39 taels and 67 qian. Suddenly, there seemed to be more buyers, rushing up by more than three taels to 43 taels and 3 qian. As for the shilling, the settlement for this month was 7 pence and 9375. In December, the banks traded with each other at 8 pence. Subsequently, there was a fluctuation of more than 1 tael. When the shilling was announced, it increased from 1 tael and 78 qian to around 3 taels. Only the daily gold was increased by 25 on the listing. The rest remained unchanged, so it was 3 taels and 2 qian. People fell after rising, which was unstable. There were about 2 taels of fluctuation, but the domestic exchange rates were still stable. Mike &amp; Co. and Hua Bi once traded December at 8 pence. After 10 o'clock, Taiwan offered December at 8 pence. Also, East Asia Mike &amp; Co. traded November U.S. dollars at 40 yuan and 5 cents, so it was reduced to around 41 taels. In an instant, Yong Heng and He Jin jumped up by more than 2 taels, and by 10:20, it rose to 43 taels and 3 qian. Later, scattered households sold some, and bills of exchange seemed to be loose and excessive. It was not easy to sell in the industry. Yuan Mao Yong, Yu Da, and others were selling tickets in succession. The market suddenly became weak. Until 11 o'clock, it fell to 38 taels and 7 qian. Later, the banks slightly traded British and American exchange rates, and December was still done at 8 pence. HSBC also accepted it at the same price. Therefore, at 11:30, it rose to 40 taels and 45 qian. However, people's hearts were uncertain, and sellers continued. Header tickets were also being sold, so the price could not stand and broke the 40 taels mark again. At 11:30, it suddenly fell to 37 taels and 7 qian. Not long after, it rebounded again. Zhi Feng Yong and others suddenly rose and chased, and in an instant, it was raised by more than 2 taels. At noon, it was 40 taels and 23 qian. By the close, it was 39 taels and 6 qian, an increase of 7 qian compared to the previous day. The maximum price in the half day was 43 taels and 3 qian, and the minimum price was 37 taels and 7 qian, a difference of 5 taels and 6 qian. The announced price was changed to 597 taels. The large 25 was listed, and the prices were pressed from 54 taels to 59 taels. The result was more than 57 taels recorded. This month was 52 taels, next month was 44 taels, November was 40 taels, and the water replenishment was 52 taels. The early market for goods was 40 taels and 8 qian, and the afternoon market was 39 taels and a half.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Saturday, the foreign exchange market was open for half a day in the morning as usual. The overseas silver market was slightly lower recently, and the forward price did not move. The U.S. dollar fell, but the market trend was soft because there was a tendency for the U.S. to sell. However, there may be a roundabout trend in the future. The exchange rate between the British pound and the U.S. dollar slightly fell. The Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar remained the same. Except for the Japanese gold, which was increased by 25, or 1 tael, 2 qian, 3 fen, and 75 li, there was no change in the exchange rates listed by HSBC. The domestic market was still peaceful and seemed to be potentially stable. The gold price slightly improved but lingered around 40 taels. Eventually, it stabilized. There was also a fluctuation of more than 5 taels in the half day, but speculators sold, which made people feel confused. There were many transactions between Chinese merchants, but there were no huge receipts and payments. British gold was settled with less sales and more purchases, totaling about 100,000 pounds. Banks such as Sumitomo and Taiwan sold. Hua Bi, HSBC, and Sumitomo absorbed. Various banks traded 100,000 pounds with each other and traded more than 100,000 U.S. dollars. Only a small amount of Japanese gold was sold, and Mitsui slightly increased. Taiwan and Sumitomo once exchanged the British pound and the Japanese yen for January at 2 shillings and 034375. The Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar for January were 49 yuan and 3125. When the market closed at noon, the exchange rates were compared with yesterday (the 19th). There was no good or bad in the exchange rates between the British pound and the U.S. dollar. Only the Japanese gold rose by 25.</p>

<p>Market Overview: Recently, various businesses in Shanghai have been unable to develop due to the unrest and obstacles to operations everywhere, which has led to financial stagnation for a long time. Suddenly, there is a large use for current foreign silver, and although Shanghai has abundant reserves, there is very little circulation. Therefore, it is difficult to supply the eager demand for a time, and the price of cents has risen sharply and unexpectedly, which cannot be curbed. The price has risen by four or five li this week, and the momentum is surging. The rising trend has not stopped. It cannot be said that it is not a special change in the financial market, and it is not related to formal commercial operations.</p>

<p>Recently, the financial community in Shanghai has been celebrating the victory in the front-line battles and has been engaged in fierce competition for various speculative and investment operations, which has caused special changes in the market. Foreign exchange is increasing, gold is stable, and various securities and government bonds are rising sharply. Buyers are crowded, and the demand for foreign silver is particularly strong. The banks are buying foreign silver in large quantities to prepare for various liquid uses. Therefore, the foreign silver cent is being stimulated by all parties, and it has also been rising sharply recently. The military supplies are being loaded out in large quantities every day, which has caused special changes in the financial market. According to the speculation of the financial community, the rising trend of securities is not over, and the increase in the price of foreign silver cents is intentional. If there is a demand for foreign silver in various places outside the port, the price of current foreign silver in Shanghai may continue to rise.</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market's Declining Trend Intensifies</h3>
<p>Early New Japonica Rice Falls More Than Half a Yuan</p>
<p>Late New Japonica Rice Falls Half a Yuan to One Yuan</p>
<p>New Xiang Rice Falls Slightly More Than One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday at Zhabei, a total of thirty ships arrived from various routes. Although buying interest was strong, the consensus was bearish. Consequently, even with reduced supplies of early Japonica rice, prices still declined. The arrival of late Japonica rice has not been substantial recently. However, market sentiment turned bearish due to clear weather, leading to a sharp decline. Top-quality rice saw a price decrease of twenty to thirty cents, while mid-grade rice fell by more than half a yuan. Exceptional quality rice barely reached twenty yuan and twenty-three cents. The supply of early Japonica rice was limited. However, factories still held inventory, so once it was released, the market price struggled to hold, and prices dropped sharply by a little over one yuan to half a yuan, with prices hovering between nineteen yuan and a half to nineteen yuan. The arrival of new Xiang rice has been plentiful, but sales have been slow. The price has also dropped sharply by sixty to seventy cents. Mid- to low-grade rice must sell for a little over one yuan less. Top-grade rice is only offered at fourteen yuan and forty or fifty cents, while mid- to low-grade rice is only thirteen yuan and ten or twenty cents. The trend for new Du Zi Xiang rice and new Jiao Bai Xiang rice is also softening, with the overall market falling by thirty to forty cents. The decline in new Ke Jian rice is particularly steep due to continuous arrivals from Ningbo and cautious retail sales, causing the market to plummet without a standard price, generally around thirteen yuan, with very few transactions. The new Bu Jian market has also fallen by about forty cents, with top-quality rice already dropping into the fourteen yuan range. Conditions within the customs area remain stable. The overall market has neither gains nor losses. The market shape for new Japonica and Xiang rice for the whole day has shown a sharp downward turn. Old stocks will also follow the downward trend soon.</p>
<p>The supply from South Shanghai and He Xia is limited, and sales are sluggish. Broken white rice is sold as soon as it arrives, showing a steady trend. Sales of the South Shanghai Bo Dao rice are quiet, with prices between twenty yuan and seventy or eighty cents for high-quality rice. The arrival of new Japonica rice here is very scarce, and the price has fallen back in line with the northern market. Fragrant Japonica rice has also fallen by a little over twenty cents, with high-quality rice offered at twenty yuan. The selling of new Yang Jian rice is becoming brisker, and sellers are eager to sell. New Jian rice is also weak and sluggish. The arrival of Du Zi Jian rice is also being met with a very soft market. Overall, the price of each Jian rice has fallen by about thirty cents, with the situation showing a tendency to decline further.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Origin Prices Reported Down by Three to Four Cents</h3>
<p>Jiangxi Rice Also Drops by Two and a Half Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, prices at the origin of foreign rice were reported down by three to four cents. Many foreign firms in the market are peddling Saigon rice. Besides Saigon, various ports in Burma also reported slight decreases. Small batches of first and second month Xiaoxiao rice are priced at six liang and one qian, while the Saigon rice currently being loaded is priced at seven liang and two or three qian, consistent with early market prices. However, Shanghai merchants are seeing new rice entering the market daily, with news of abundant harvests from various regions. Although foreign rice is cheap and profitable, they are afraid of repeating past mistakes and dare not place orders.</p>
<p>Yesterday, over five thousand bags of new Jiangxi rice arrived, with more expected to arrive continuously. However, sales in Shanghai have stalled, with limited buying interest on this street. The consensus is bearish, and the market immediately shows a downward trend, falling by as much as two and a half cents compared to the previous day. It is estimated that six hundred bags of Jiangxi rice were procured early by this street's brokers at a price of twelve yuan and ten and a half cents to eleven yuan and eighty cents; three hundred bags later at sixteen yuan and ten cents; and two hundred bags of the original price at seventeen yuan and a half.</p>
<h3>Marked Flour Market Opens Strong and Rises</h3>
<p>Flour Transportation Ban Lifted, Filling Speculative Short Positions</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the morning and afternoon opening of the flour market, prices for each month rose step by step. Although the price of foreign wheat continued to decrease by four, five, six, or seven cents, the current situation has turned optimistic, and the flour transportation ban has indeed been lifted. Although this year's northern harvest is abundant, southern flour has been unavailable for a long time. Realistically speaking, there will eventually be a greater need. Since the political situation and the transportation ban have been resolved simultaneously, market sentiment will inevitably become enthusiastic. Therefore, buying interest in each session of the morning and afternoon has been strong. Speculative short positions outside the industry are also being covered substantially at any time. As a result, near-term and distant terms have become more expensive based on actual sales and disregard the price of foreign wheat. As a result, this month has risen two cents and seven and a half mils compared to the previous day, October has risen two and a half cents, November has risen two cents, December and January have risen half a cent, and February has risen one cent and seven and a half mils.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Shows Signs of Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the morning and afternoon opening of the wheat market, prices for each month suddenly turned up and became firm. Because the current situation is improving, it is expected that future flour sales will change from stagnant to smooth, so the future of wheat naturally also has hope. Although foreign wheat is still reported down, the current must ultimately take into account actual sales. The ratio of foreign countries seems to have an emergency that is far from enough. The gradual rebound in market conditions is not without reason. As a result, September and October rose by four cents compared to the previous day, November rose by five cents, and December to February rose by four cents. The market condition of spot wheat has stabilized for exceptionally high-quality wheat. However, mid- and low-quality wheat have thick inventories on the market. Customers see that the factory's demand has been activated, and they are all seeking to sell first, so each grade is slightly lower by two or three cents. However, the northern transport after a smooth journey should not be smaller. More than 10,000 packages of Shandong red and white wheat, Yaowan wheat, and Bao Ying Sha Shi wheat were opened and went to Fuxin to select the high-quality ones, and 5,700 packages were taken away.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods, Candied Date Market Trends Toward Stability</h3>
<p>Candied dates have recently been arriving successively, and the market is gradually stabilizing. Sales are still good. Yesterday, Huigong Tutu sold twenty-six liang of Jiaxing goods, and Tutu sold twenty-two or twenty-three liang. The upper and lower grades still follow the previous example with an added discount. The top large-grained "Super Egg" dates sold for as high as thirty liang. There is also a type made from apples that is as crystal clear as dates and sells for seventy yuan, but the output is very small.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Northern Merchants Search for Eastern Fabrics</h3>
<p>The piece goods market has rebounded and is trending higher. Northern merchants are searching for Eastern goods very eagerly. Because the situation is deteriorating rapidly, Osaka's fixed prices have soared. Therefore, merchants from Tianjin and Qingdao are coming to Shanghai to search for spot goods. Yesterday, the most traded goods were fine serge, with two to three hundred pieces traded. 球 has sold for three qian, one fen and a half, Huxinting is sold at two qian and seven fen, and Hanshan, etc., at two qian, six fen and seven li. This is two li and a half higher than the highest market price last week. Local merchants see customer help activities and are also moving forward one after another. Yuehua velvet has risen back to the highest price previously opened. Large-patterned and mid-patterned are already two qian, and black flower is one qian, nine fen and two and a half mils. Direct tribute woolen cloth, with the hardest body above the middle grade, has been out of stock for a while, and Santan Yin Yue has already been transported and opened at three qian and four fen, Shile black at three qian and four and a half fen, and Lie Yan at three qian, one fen and a half. Moganshan is at three qian, one fen and two and a half mils. In addition to this street, Han merchants also need a lot. The Ting Nei, which has a deep flower color, has also been popular recently, having risen from two qian to two qian and five mils. Western goods are still stagnant. Only Sichuan merchants have released more than one hundred pieces of Fang Li direct tribute woolen cloth in recent days, with a price of two qian and four fen.</p>
<h3>Light Fabrics and Woolens Selling Briskly in a Timely Manner</h3>
<p>Sales Prices Rising Due to Lack of Goods</p>
<p>Recently, light fabrics such as 嗶叽, serge, patterned woolens, direct tribute velvet, and chocolate woolen cloth from the woolen guild have been selling very well. Local merchants have healthy demand. Patterned woolens with new designs are popular. 嗶叽拆藍 must be matched with other colors of Huate woolens, only navy blue is more expensive, because most of them are needed for Western clothes. Plaid-colored Huate woolens also sell quite well. The trend for hat woolens is also good. The sales price continues to rise because there is a lack of arriving stock.</p>
<h3>Hardware: English White Iron, Thick Patterns and Colors Scarce</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been a shortage of English white iron with thick patterns and colors in circulation. Because the previous month's prior order fell sharply, hardware industry suffered a lot, so they are reluctant to place orders, so it has been a long time since no orders have been placed. Because there are not many goods currently arriving, the standard price is soaring. At the moment, the estimated price for No. 34 is twelve liang and a half per box, No. 26 is fourteen liang, No. 28 is fourteen liang and seven qian and a half, and No. 31 is sixteen liang and two qian and a half, which is two qian and a half higher than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Coal Market: Small Decline Expected in Gold Prices in the Coal Market</h3>
<p>Foreign Firm Orders Have Not Arrived, and There is Also a Shortage</p>
<p>At the moment, the gold price is fluctuating. All dealers are expecting a small decline in its price. For the time being, no foreign firm orders have been made. The number of current arrivals is also small, and sales are also very sluggish. Yesterday at the tea party, the main merchants' transactions amounted to more than two hundred tons of white coal and seven hundred tons of bituminous coal. The market is stable.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: Another 320,000 yuan worth of foreign currency loaded for Hong Kong, and 10,000 yuan loaded for Hankou.</p>
<p>Four hundred and fifty packages of Huzhou silk will be shipped to England and France tomorrow.</p>
<p>Four hundred tons of tea are shipped to Spain.</p>
<p>One thousand six hundred tons of American cotton have arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Seven hundred and sixty pieces of Hubei official cloth arrived yesterday.</p>

<p>Five hundred barrels of raw oil were shipped to Little Luzon.</p>
<p>Six thousand packages of soybeans were shipped to the Netherlands and Germany.</p>
<p>Recently, more than two thousand pieces of Japanese kelp and seafood have been transported into the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>More than five hundred pieces of burlap bags came to Shanghai from the Orient.</p>
<p>Another four thousand boxes of piece goods and foreign cloth were loaded from Japan. A new telegram from Hakodate says that the price of kelp production has plummeted by 150 yuan per 100 stones.</p>
<p>A telegram from Hong Kong reports that the supply of Golden Hook has gradually increased, and the current market price for high-quality goods is 113 yuan.</p>

<p>(3) The North Sichuan Railway to Chongqing is not far away. It starts from the east bank of the Jialing River in Jiangbei County, passes along Mount Hua, and ends at the west bank of Hechuan County, a distance of 120 li. It was initiated by Mr. Li Chougen and Mr. Tang Jianzhang, who raised 300,000 yuan to form a company. Construction of the section from the Jialing River bank to Wenxingchang was started in the autumn of the 17th year of the Republic and is now nearing completion. The railway is mainly used for transporting coal and also for transporting passengers. The northeast is mostly mountainous, making it difficult to lay railway tracks. After the failure of the Sichuan-Han Railway Company, entrepreneurs have regarded it as a long journey. However, the colleagues of the North Sichuan Company did not avoid difficulties and completed it to the end. Those who are enthusiastic about entrepreneurial endeavors can see that the country can rise up from this.</p>

<h3>A Journey to Dante's Hometown</h3>
<p>— Hualin</p>
<p>(Artistic World) and (Scientific World) are the crystallization of human culture. One belongs to the expression of inner life, is subjective, imaginative, and transcends all interests, so that we do not fall into the bitterness of reality but appreciate all the beauty of life, with hope and passion, so living science is art, making our lives richer and striving for the path of creation. The other belongs to the exploration of the external world, is objective, rational, analyzes all phenomena, and seeks a kind of equivalent explanation, but based on the established facts, it is the result of the facts rather than the origin of the facts, so dead art is science, and it can provide us with many lessons, making our power to invade the external world more precise and changing the grand view of the world. These two often conflict. One seeks the absolute sublime beauty, and the other seeks a relative analysis of the truth. In fact, life is all in these (two worlds). The true literary artist is not just a daydream, a frenzy, but also puts it into practice, leading the masses to the path of light, creating an ideal new kingdom in this melancholy and dark world, so the artist's mind is never bound by reality, his heart is in the famous mountains, in the peaks, and friends with the colorful clouds, and friends with the stars and moon. He hates all achievements and despises all mediocrities, but he is also a prophet, seeing the justice that people do not see and loving the greatness that people do not feel. This kind of (passion) abandons everything in the world, but everything belongs to him. I am convinced that the greatness of this kind of personality is definitely not something that the scientific world can imagine. I traveled to Italy to explore the secret of the Renaissance and felt a profound lesson in life. Please say a word to the famous city (Florence) first.</p>
<p>In the dark ages of the Middle Ages, the Papal Party and the Royalist Party fought each other, foreign troubles arose frequently, and internal worries followed. Mediocre people tended to curry favor, and virtuous people lived and died in exile. The heroes who reformed politics and religion were burned to death in front of the Old Palace. The poets who rushed to save their country could not be tolerated in their hometowns, and the architects, sculptors, and painters starved to death on the poor roads and were exiled in foreign countries. In more than 1,300 years, most of the city was destroyed by fire, the Black and White parties fought for power, there was a great flood and a terrifying plague, and the Papal Party and the Royalist Party fought more cruelly. Unexpectedly, a ray of light was found in this dark world, that is, the literary artists confronted reality and declared war on power. They created many models of great personalities in their fantasies, and they broke through the prison of selfishness and self-interest in their passion. A fierce war left many traces. Hundreds of years later, the light shone everywhere. Who would dare to say that modern culture was not influenced by the Renaissance, and who would not say that (Dante's Divine Comedy) was the only guide to indicate light in the darkness? Like China's (Qu Yuan, our close friend, the world will be split in half, no matter where you go, it is only the (Qu Yuan world) and the (non-Qu Yuan world) (Dante) is a latecomer in the Qu Yuan world. When I was in (Florence), I admired the works of many artists, the first of which was (Giotto), the creator of Dante's friend. He and the three words (Dante) (Florence) are intertwined. (Giotto) is an architect, a sculptor, and a painter. He is a good friend of (Dante) (Bettia Ge). In all of his creations, he only expresses the highest passion and love. Others, such as the sculptor (Donatello), express the effort of life, and the frescoes of (Ang Eli Guo) are intoxicatingly elegant and mysterious. But every time I visit the tomb of (Medici) and appreciate (Michelangelo's) four statues, I become the reincarnation of life day and night, expressing the extremely tired life with extremely powerful muscles. There is also a statue of a thinker, which and (Vinci's) (Smile) become the eternal mystery of life, which no one can guess. This statue is the statue of (Medici Ronhang), a thinker wearing a warrior's costume, but his face is hidden in the crown, and his posture does not have a clear indication. There are two statues in this hall, one representing a dreamer and the other representing a businessman, but they are all powerful warriors in the bitterness of day and night. This mystery cannot be guessed to the end. Human beings are all working hard in this way to go to (Florence), the genius of (Wen Si) is the (Savior) painted, what a profound expression of the power of the world, the tragic fate of life is sacrificed because of love, and the extremely simple curve expresses the extremely compassionate passion. For such masterpieces, it can be seen how deeply literary artists penetrate into the inner heart of life, and the lesson they give us is only to constantly strive to die for love! (Vinci) is an uninhibited genius, a literary artist and a scientist, who died in France, just like the poet (Bettia Ge) who wandered in France and admired a woman named (Lao), whom he praised for the rest of his life. They both felt the unfortunate fate of their motherland and could not be known at that time, which shows that the more genius is tempered, the greater the power of creation will be. Don't you see that (Masaccio), who starved to death in a humble room, left behind immortal masterpieces, completed (Giotto's) soul in the (Ge Mai) Church in Florence, and attached it with a physical creation, surpassing his predecessors in precision, but his life was poor, which is probably the reason why heaven bestowed genius. It shows that (cultivating genius is passion, not wealth, and what we demand to be satisfied is desire, not selfishness). Only by understanding this can we understand the value of life and do a great unworthy undertaking instead of ordinary people, who are constantly immersed in selfishness and do not know that there are shameful things in the world. I traveled to (Athens) in Italy and heard the wind of (Plato) in the countryside, drank the spring of love of (Dante), sang in front of (Lily), lingered on the banks of the (Arno) River, which made my heart drunk and my love infatuated. I only know that (the need for mood) is far better than hunger and cold. Whether it is a literary artist or a scientist, only (love) can increase the happiness of life. What I call happiness is that it cannot be found in dreams and cannot be obtained in the real world. In other words, only a person with great ambition, only a person with great passion, can despise all wealth and power and create a new civilization of splendor for the world. Now (Florence) is left with traces of blood, which is wet, I don't know, but what the genius demands for his personal satisfaction is all the more terrifying and makes people bow down, that is (creating a new world for love and destroying an old world for hate).</p>
